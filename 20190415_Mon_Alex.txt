[00:00.000 --> 00:09.840]  A lot of this has already been investigated and a substantial portion of it has been investigated
[00:09.840 --> 00:17.960]  and is being investigated by the Office of Inspector General at the Department.
[00:17.960 --> 00:22.700]  But one of the things I want to do is pull together all the information from the various
[00:22.700 --> 00:29.760]  investigations that have gone on, including on the Hill and in the Department, and see
[00:29.760 --> 00:33.680]  if there are any remaining questions to be addressed.
[00:33.680 --> 00:39.360]  Trump has no choice but to go after the arrogant, hateful, anti-American globalist swamp that
[00:39.360 --> 00:44.480]  has infested not just our nation, but the world, and the fact that the crimes committed
[00:44.480 --> 00:52.200]  by the security state controlled by the Democrats are so massive that it will either destroy
[00:52.200 --> 00:56.080]  this nation and enslave the world or their corruption will bring them down.
[00:56.080 --> 01:00.440]  And of course you're noticing that everything we've talked about, everything we've broken
[01:00.440 --> 01:05.360]  down, everything we've laid out is coming out in the open.
[01:05.360 --> 01:12.080]  The bulk of information were unverified, uncorroborated information paid for by Hillary.
[01:12.080 --> 01:13.080]  And guess what?
[01:13.080 --> 01:18.160]  They denied an American citizen his constitutional rights, and they got their back door right
[01:18.160 --> 01:21.600]  into the Trump campaign through Carter Page.
[01:21.600 --> 01:27.880]  And in December 15th of 2016, we know the Obama officials, oh, they just incidentally
[01:27.880 --> 01:29.960]  spied on Trump officials.
[01:29.960 --> 01:35.640]  After Rice, well, she reportedly unmasked the names of Steve Bannon, Jared Kushner,
[01:35.640 --> 01:39.480]  Lieutenant General, 33-year vet Michael Flynn.
[01:39.480 --> 01:45.080]  After months and months of waiting, truth and justice and facts, in spite of all of them,
[01:45.080 --> 01:50.120]  are now beginning to come cascading down and will drown the proper people.
[01:50.120 --> 01:56.920]  The world understands false flags, the world understands subterfuge and geopolitical manipulations,
[01:56.920 --> 02:01.800]  and they understand how globalism operates, and they understand the constant staged events
[02:01.800 --> 02:06.920]  that Democrats and deep staters are involved in, and now the people are healthy skeptics
[02:06.920 --> 02:08.360]  again, many of them.
[02:08.360 --> 02:13.520]  You're not suggesting, though, that spying occurred?
[02:13.520 --> 02:22.440]  I don't, well, I guess you could, I think spying did occur, yes, I think spying did
[02:22.440 --> 02:23.440]  occur.
[02:23.440 --> 02:26.440]  That's more than half the population is somewhat awake.
[02:26.440 --> 02:29.760]  The problem is a good third of people are cult members that are going to follow the
[02:29.760 --> 02:32.840]  establishment down any rat hole.
[02:32.840 --> 02:36.440]  They're going to execute whatever they're told, they're going to believe whatever new
[02:36.440 --> 02:43.360]  delusion they're given, and they believe red, blooded Americans that believe in God and
[02:43.360 --> 02:47.440]  country, and family, and free market, and hard work.
[02:47.440 --> 02:54.040]  What made this country great, they have been taught and believed that we are the enemy,
[02:54.040 --> 02:55.040]  period.
[02:55.040 --> 03:05.200]  Care was founded after 9-11, because they recognized that some people did something.
[03:05.200 --> 03:06.200]  You have no idea right now.
[03:06.200 --> 03:09.440]  I have another one, another plane just hit.
[03:09.440 --> 03:14.200]  Some people did something.
[03:14.200 --> 03:17.440]  Oh my goodness, there is smoke pouring out the pentagon.
[03:17.440 --> 03:20.440]  Some people did something.
[03:20.440 --> 03:34.840]  It just blew straight into it.
[03:34.840 --> 03:39.440]  And so we're all going to have to sit here and discuss and debate what we're going to
[03:39.440 --> 03:42.320]  do to counter these individuals.
[03:42.320 --> 03:47.040]  And now we have Congressman Nunez, the Republican leader on the Judiciary Committee.
[03:47.040 --> 03:54.440]  Devin Nunez is called to make eight referrals, five of them he described as straightforward,
[03:54.440 --> 04:02.760]  but it could be the beginning of actual investigation into the investigators in a meaningful way.
[04:02.760 --> 04:03.760]  Your thoughts?
[04:03.760 --> 04:05.400]  The debate is a good start.
[04:05.400 --> 04:10.960]  It's one of the reasons the Mueller operation continued well over a year past its reasonable
[04:10.960 --> 04:15.760]  conclusion which was over a year ago where they knew there was no Russian collusion.
[04:15.760 --> 04:22.400]  By continuing to operate, it essentially protected the investigators from being investigated
[04:22.400 --> 04:26.920]  and those involved in setting up the Mueller operation from being seriously reviewed by
[04:26.920 --> 04:28.000]  the Justice Department.
[04:28.000 --> 04:29.240]  Now that's gone.
[04:29.240 --> 04:33.320]  The criminals in the government told you they were doing it.
[04:33.320 --> 04:37.520]  I went and researched the way they could do it, the only ways they could carry it out.
[04:37.520 --> 04:43.400]  And sure enough, there was the Defense Department budget that Obama put billions into to do
[04:43.400 --> 04:45.280]  everything you've seen.
[04:45.280 --> 04:53.560]  MSNBC, Daily Beast, CNN, Media Matters, they've all been paid Department of Defense and CIA
[04:53.560 --> 04:57.800]  money to do what you've seen the last two and a half years.
[04:57.800 --> 04:59.800]  It is a scandal.
[04:59.800 --> 05:03.800]  Well, I've got some really good news for all the viewers and all the listeners.
[05:03.800 --> 05:06.680]  This was going to be a big loss because we couldn't get the Deep Earth Crystals anymore
[05:06.680 --> 05:11.240]  in a year and a half fight, but we have the original producer, the original crystal source,
[05:11.240 --> 05:14.640]  the best atomic iodine in the world, X-2 is back.
[05:14.640 --> 05:15.640]  We got it.
[05:15.640 --> 05:17.240]  This deal just happened about a month ago.
[05:17.240 --> 05:18.840]  We rushed it into production.
[05:18.840 --> 05:19.840]  It's been bottled.
[05:19.840 --> 05:24.080]  The labels are being put on today and that it's going to be on an 18-wheeler right here
[05:24.080 --> 05:28.680]  to Austin from the plant in the Rockies and it's going to be shipped out to you.
[05:28.680 --> 05:34.200]  Make sure and sign up for auto-ship, get an additional 10% off, the 25% off, celebration
[05:34.200 --> 05:36.960]  of the fact that we got it back and we're relaunching it.
[05:36.960 --> 05:41.120]  Research the iodine conspiracy, find out why it's so important, find out why the globalists
[05:41.120 --> 05:47.080]  don't want you to have the good halogens and what you have the bad halogens at infowarstore.com.
[05:47.080 --> 05:51.160]  That's the umbrella site, infowarstore.com, they should write the supplements and this
[05:51.160 --> 05:54.200]  is the King Daddy, ladies and gentlemen.
[05:54.200 --> 06:01.600]  This reality is X-2 original now back at infowarstore.com.
[06:01.600 --> 06:08.720]  We are drugged out, we are following other people's opinions, we are controlled by the
[06:08.720 --> 06:11.840]  media, today it all changes.
[06:11.840 --> 06:16.840]  This reality has been forced upon us, it is a choice, just like when I said slavery is
[06:16.840 --> 06:17.840]  a choice.
[06:17.840 --> 06:22.320]  Einstein says the depth of insanity is doing the same thing, expecting a different result.
[06:22.320 --> 06:25.640]  Should we keep on saying I hate you, I hate you, you f*** you, you f*** you, how are we
[06:25.640 --> 06:30.840]  going to get a different result out of hate, why don't we just try love, why don't we just
[06:30.840 --> 06:37.600]  try love, we have the resources for a peaceful world, you know sometimes you need some crazy
[06:37.600 --> 06:43.040]  mother f***ers to change something, Steve Jobs is crazy, now we all on Steve Jobs phones,
[06:43.040 --> 06:48.560]  they say trucks crazy, they say I'm crazy, but I'm here to show love, it's a bigger plan
[06:48.560 --> 06:53.400]  and I'm just doing what the universe told me.
[06:53.400 --> 07:09.200]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God, it's Alex Jones.
[07:09.200 --> 07:15.520]  It's Monday, April 15th, 2019, it's the day we pay our taxes to the private, the federal
[07:15.520 --> 07:21.800]  reserve, and our president has called for an audit of the Federal Reserve, he's called
[07:21.800 --> 07:26.360]  it the enemy of the people, this is attempting to spike and destroy our economy, this is
[07:26.360 --> 07:33.040]  going to be a very important transmission today, former treasury agent inside IRS whistleblower,
[07:33.040 --> 07:37.920]  Joe Banister joins us coming up in the third hour, the vaunted Caitlyn Bennett, the amazing
[07:37.920 --> 07:42.760]  Millie Weaver, both at a Bernie Sanders rally yesterday, they'll be joining us in the second
[07:42.760 --> 07:48.840]  hour with a lot of exclusive footage and a clear Democrat false flag, where they had
[07:48.840 --> 07:53.240]  a man running around screaming the n-word in a make America great again hat, it's all
[07:53.240 --> 08:00.880]  coming up, shot poll up on Drudge Report, Bernie takes the lead out of the field of 18 Democrats
[08:00.880 --> 08:10.240]  with even more set to join, we've got amazing video up on infowars.com and newswars.com
[08:10.240 --> 08:17.200]  right now, on the site where you have Bernie supporters openly telling our reporters that
[08:17.200 --> 08:22.520]  they want free healthcare, they don't want to have to have jobs, they want everything
[08:22.520 --> 08:30.440]  absolutely free, they want free housing, they want free education, it's really mind blowing
[08:30.440 --> 08:35.640]  how stupid they are, but they are listening to the siren song, a free stuff that so many
[08:35.640 --> 08:43.040]  people throughout history have basically become beguiled or hypnotized by and then within
[08:43.040 --> 08:48.880]  a decade or so those nations and their prosperity is marked by nothing but giant tombstones,
[08:48.880 --> 08:54.920]  so that's all coming up, it's very clear that I've been dead on when it comes to the
[08:54.920 --> 08:59.440]  master plan to take down the internet and then what they're going to replace it with
[08:59.440 --> 09:05.080]  and we're going to be covering that at the bottom of the hour and this is the only place
[09:05.080 --> 09:10.080]  in a big way that President Trump is dropping the ball and I know he's not stupid, I know
[09:10.080 --> 09:18.760]  his advisors aren't stupid, I know that he's had Donald Jr. as a surrogate out there beating
[09:18.760 --> 09:23.640]  the bushes trying to get Congress and others to move against big tech censorship but if
[09:23.640 --> 09:27.920]  we lose on this, we lose on everything else, so it doesn't matter how much we're winning
[09:27.920 --> 09:36.240]  on other fronts, if we let the big mega web oligopoly that Drudge is linked to up there,
[09:36.240 --> 09:43.280]  if we let that get into place with what it's planning, it's, as Mr. Paxton said in Aliens,
[09:43.280 --> 09:47.400]  game over man, game over.
[09:47.400 --> 09:52.920]  Why is Zuckerberg so relaxed about UK online speech rules or EU censorship, well I'll tell
[09:52.920 --> 09:58.840]  you why, he wrote the damn things, Southern Poverty Law Center and the rest of these guys,
[09:58.840 --> 10:05.320]  we have the master plan, we know how to blow up the death star politically and that's why
[10:05.320 --> 10:11.680]  they want this show off air because on subjects like the criminal embedded groups Obama left
[10:11.680 --> 10:17.280]  in government when he left office or when it comes to COG, continuity government or
[10:17.280 --> 10:23.520]  when it comes to 25th Amendment coup takedown plans against the president and when it comes
[10:23.520 --> 10:30.480]  to understanding the architecture of the internet takeover, the technocracy they plan to replace
[10:30.480 --> 10:38.640]  it with, I and my guest and this great crew are the most over the target bombers, dropping
[10:38.640 --> 10:44.600]  truth bombs right on the enemy and that's why your prayers and your support is so paramount.
[10:44.600 --> 10:47.360]  I'm just going to say this and I'm going to leave it at that and then tell you all the
[10:47.360 --> 10:51.120]  other news that's coming up.
[10:51.120 --> 10:53.480]  How does that great novel begin?
[10:53.480 --> 11:00.160]  It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the epitome of us all going
[11:00.160 --> 11:04.440]  to heaven or all going straight to hell, maybe we'll pull that up or print that off, I'll
[11:04.440 --> 11:06.720]  read it next break.
[11:06.720 --> 11:12.240]  Our work here at Info Wars, your work supporting us and promoting what we do as a family has
[11:12.240 --> 11:20.000]  never been more effective, we've never been more successful at our reach quite frankly
[11:20.000 --> 11:24.440]  and I thought this morning about this and I thought you know you really shouldn't let
[11:24.440 --> 11:28.920]  the enemy knows this because they'll just come after you stronger but you know what,
[11:28.920 --> 11:34.360]  I'm not a person that engages in deception, even if it's deception by omission, I always
[11:34.360 --> 11:39.520]  tell people I'm coming, hey Bilderberg, I'm coming to cover you, hey Democrats I'm coming
[11:39.520 --> 11:44.640]  to your event because I want them to know I'm coming, I want to walk right into the
[11:44.640 --> 11:54.840]  trap and I do just want to announce to the listeners that congratulations, congratulations
[11:54.840 --> 11:59.920]  to you and everybody else, we're in one hell of a fight but we're winning and there's some
[11:59.920 --> 12:05.720]  very interesting things happening behind the scenes and things that we're tracking and
[12:05.720 --> 12:10.160]  they have really underestimated the people of America and the world and the globalists
[12:10.160 --> 12:14.040]  have really underestimated their censorship and their attacks and the effect it would
[12:14.040 --> 12:20.960]  have and it has just taken our work and basically highlighted it, emboldened it and so all the
[12:20.960 --> 12:27.400]  people that count are now listening, sure we had maybe in total bigger audiences some
[12:27.400 --> 12:35.160]  days than we do now, some days but who we're reaching at policy level on a planetary scale
[12:35.160 --> 12:44.320]  is incredible, not just the president of the United States but a lot of other people and
[12:44.320 --> 12:50.320]  I can tell you that those folks have reached out to us, we've been in high level communications
[12:50.320 --> 12:57.400]  with world leaders, heads of industry, you name it, letting us know hey you're going
[12:57.400 --> 13:01.160]  to see some movement, we're on your side, you're on our side and I'm like let me wait
[13:01.160 --> 13:07.160]  and see and I'm seeing it, so the empire has been striking back but the people are now
[13:07.160 --> 13:11.200]  about to strike back, this thing goes like a soccer game or a football game back and
[13:11.200 --> 13:17.920]  forth and then different groups get possession of the ball and I can tell you, we have possession
[13:17.920 --> 13:23.600]  of the ball my friends, we are dominating when it comes to policy and effecting change
[13:23.600 --> 13:28.480]  for the better, where we're not dominating is on the capital front, yeah we can bring
[13:28.480 --> 13:33.440]  in $20, $30 million a year and then half of that goes into product cost and the rest
[13:33.440 --> 13:40.480]  of it goes into legal and bandwidth and everything else, I mean sometimes I pay a month $500,000
[13:40.480 --> 13:46.000]  IT bills and bandwidth bills so the money goes away and with them not letting us advertise
[13:46.000 --> 13:49.800]  on these different Google platforms and different systems where we would go out and advertise
[13:49.800 --> 13:52.960]  not just to our audience but the general public, that was bringing in a lot of the money we
[13:52.960 --> 13:57.520]  had to fund things so now we go back to the core audience of radio and TV listeners and
[13:57.520 --> 14:02.600]  viewers and folks watching at InfoWars.com and PresentPlanet.com and just say listen
[14:02.600 --> 14:07.480]  it's simple, if you'll just go get your coffee, super high quality, your toothpaste, fluoride
[14:07.480 --> 14:11.440]  free colloidal silver iodine 4 to 5, if you'll just get your t-shirts, your books, your films
[14:11.440 --> 14:19.000]  or water filtration, your air filtration from us, you get great products that have incredible
[14:19.000 --> 14:22.640]  5 star reviews by tens of thousands of people, it's more than that, some products have like
[14:22.640 --> 14:28.400]  10,000 reviews, 5 star and you fund the second American Revolution on a global scale, also
[14:28.400 --> 14:35.160]  fly your colors proud, all t-shirts, some designers, some just you know good old fashioned
[14:35.160 --> 14:43.880]  t-shirts are all 50% off, I mean some of the designer shirts cost me up to $19 a piece
[14:43.880 --> 14:49.600]  and I just want to move these babies so I sell them for $29.95, some of these are designer
[14:49.600 --> 14:54.480]  shirts, some of them cost me $5 so when I sell them for 50% off you know we make money,
[14:54.480 --> 15:02.680]  but a lot of the shirts cost me on average $15, some $19.95, at 50% off, a lot of these
[15:02.680 --> 15:09.360]  are loss leaders, so all the t-shirts are 50% off, that might have gotten lost in the memo,
[15:09.360 --> 15:13.840]  all apparel too, I notice the ball caps haven't been lowered 50% off, I'm going to have that
[15:13.840 --> 15:20.720]  change tell them it's just in the oversight, everything, all apparel 50% off, all apparel
[15:20.720 --> 15:25.040]  50% off, and like if you've got a good made in America ball cap, it'll cost you like
[15:25.040 --> 15:29.560]  $7 even if you buy like 5,000 of them, and then when you stitch $17.76 on it, let's look
[15:29.560 --> 15:35.680]  at another $3, so you know when your hat costs you $10 and you're selling it for $20 and
[15:35.680 --> 15:43.480]  you discount it, that's at cost, so everything, all the apparel 50% off, 50% off at infowarstore.com,
[15:43.480 --> 15:47.280]  it's the new big mega sale, and there's several other big sales that I don't have time to
[15:47.280 --> 15:51.240]  tell you about, but I'll tell you about later because we're going to break here, but there
[15:51.240 --> 15:56.840]  is a lot of other big sales of the biggest ever on water filtration, air filtration,
[15:56.840 --> 15:59.520]  storable food, it's all there.
[15:59.520 --> 16:03.400]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the US, what if

[17:04.120 --> 17:09.200]  the world, George Washington had warned us against foreign wars, the United States of
[17:09.200 --> 17:15.960]  Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken, its former colony the U.S.
[17:15.960 --> 17:21.880]  had to save the empire, was there ever a vote, who do we fight for, the deep state began with

[17:34.800 --> 17:38.760]  was a prisoner of the out left sanctuary state until one day I chose to lead my family
[17:38.760 --> 17:43.640]  to freedom, today we live on a sustainable 20 acre homestead where we shoot, hunt, garden
[17:43.640 --> 17:47.840]  and homeschool our children without the tyranny of the nanny state looking over us, if you're
[17:47.840 --> 17:52.080]  ready to flee the city to the freedom of Idaho or Montana, our Black Rifle Real Estate team

[18:06.560 --> 18:10.360]  Remember when TV didn't watch you, you watch television, there's no reviews yet for it,
[18:10.360 --> 18:14.320]  but it's at InfoWarsTour.com, we bought the best selling antenna, we sell it for what
[18:14.320 --> 18:20.080]  is it $5 less than Amazon does, InfoWars HD, digital TV antenna, and I mean, look, you're
[18:20.080 --> 18:24.960]  talking like a hundred plus digital channels, and then they'll have four or five sub channels
[18:24.960 --> 18:29.660]  of every old cool TV show, old movies, it's like way better than cable, and it's like
[18:29.660 --> 18:35.720]  Hawaii 5.0, Gilligan's Island, Idri Magini, Dallas, stuff from the 90s, new stuff, like
[18:35.720 --> 18:39.920]  when the Olympics was on, I didn't know there were 10 channels of Olympics on TV, I mean
[18:39.920 --> 18:44.800]  it's like my God, this is way better than cable, and people don't know that it's free
[18:44.800 --> 18:46.520]  after you buy the antenna.
[18:46.520 --> 18:51.520]  The point is, is that there's so many channels, and it's not watching you, it's not tracking
[18:51.520 --> 18:56.520]  you, so we do sell the antenna's at the lowest price you'll find, InfoWarsTour.com.
[18:56.520 --> 19:03.040]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long, go ahead.
[19:03.040 --> 19:07.840]  Yeah, I just have to say something, man, it seems like every time I turn on your broadcast,
[19:07.840 --> 19:10.560]  you're bragging, it just gets old, man.
[19:10.560 --> 19:13.120]  I'm going to shut you down right now, okay?
[19:13.120 --> 19:17.320]  You're taking calls about your nomination, do you understand they're having congressional
[19:17.320 --> 19:23.320]  hearings trying to shut us down, do you understand I'm ringing the alarm, if that was happening
[19:23.320 --> 19:27.800]  to anybody else, I'd be freaked out, I mean what's it going to take, us being shut down,
[19:27.800 --> 19:28.800]  is that what you want, Frank?
[19:28.800 --> 19:29.800]  Yeah, you know what, Alex?
[19:29.800 --> 19:35.200]  I'll put it on pause again, hey Frank, do you understand it's not bragging to say we
[19:35.200 --> 19:39.920]  are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help, as much begging as I do,
[19:39.920 --> 19:44.080]  we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this, I'm not going to just stop growth
[19:44.080 --> 19:47.840]  and let them start pushing us backwards, do you understand I need your help, Frank?
[19:47.840 --> 19:50.120]  I need your help, Frank?
[19:50.120 --> 19:55.160]  Go to InfoWarsTour.com right now and help fund the InfoWars.
[19:55.160 --> 19:58.160]  Do you understand I need your help, Frank?
[19:58.160 --> 20:03.520]  Free press needs your help, Frank.
[20:03.520 --> 20:21.560]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:21.560 --> 20:28.160]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups, you want to stop tyranny?
[20:28.160 --> 20:35.240]  Well so does he, live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[20:35.240 --> 20:44.560]  So, we know that the big ultra rich in the world, on average, are socialists, are communists
[20:44.560 --> 20:48.200]  because they want you to be domesticated, they want you out of the political and financial
[20:48.200 --> 20:55.440]  game, they want consolidation, they want pliable domesticated minions, like George
[20:55.440 --> 20:59.400]  Carlin talked about, and if you read Carol Quigley, one of their top statisticians and
[20:59.400 --> 21:04.720]  tacticians in the 60s, one of their top political scientists, Bill Clinton's mentor, he says
[21:04.720 --> 21:11.520]  we want dumb, pliable, illiterate people and we want to domesticate them using socialism
[21:11.520 --> 21:16.840]  and communism, then we'll have an international system of feudalism over them.
[21:16.840 --> 21:23.120]  He wrote that in the 1100 page book, Tragedy and Hope, so that's the real system.
[21:23.120 --> 21:29.240]  And so you've got 18 candidates and they're all competing with each other about who will
[21:29.240 --> 21:36.000]  give you the most free stuff, Pito O'Rourke, excuse me, Beto O'Rourke, says he'll give
[21:36.000 --> 21:43.200]  you free healthcare, free tuition, free homes, and AOC goes further, she put out in a Green
[21:43.200 --> 21:47.800]  Deal, which she first said was a false flag, later she admitted it was real, said a staffer
[21:47.800 --> 21:53.520]  accidentally put it in there, that no airplanes or no cars except for her, that you don't
[21:53.520 --> 21:58.520]  have to even work to get an income.
[21:58.520 --> 22:02.760]  It's not unable, it's don't want to work.
[22:02.760 --> 22:07.320]  So they're speaking to the millennials who happen to be slobs, I'm not saying all millennials
[22:07.320 --> 22:11.840]  are slobs, I think it's a cliche that's overdone, but a lot of them, if you live here in Austin,
[22:11.840 --> 22:17.320]  Texas, glow in the dark, they can barely walk, they're entitled, they're mentally ill, and
[22:17.320 --> 22:23.760]  they don't want to have success in their life other than banding together as authoritarian
[22:23.760 --> 22:27.200]  control freaks to run producers' lives.
[22:27.200 --> 22:32.880]  They have the key instinct of a bloodsucker that we need to be told what to do and how
[22:32.880 --> 22:38.800]  to behave because they're sucking off of us, they're the elite bloodsuckers, the minion
[22:38.800 --> 22:42.360]  class of the establishment.
[22:42.360 --> 22:52.160]  And so now we've got people running away from what the real democratic party platform is.
[22:52.160 --> 22:59.520]  Oh, they're out there, all 18 of them competing with each other, Bernie Sanders, AOC, Bito,
[22:59.520 --> 23:03.560]  all of them about how much free stuff they're going to give you.
[23:03.560 --> 23:08.060]  But then when people get upset about it, they go, oh, no, that's not really what our party
[23:08.060 --> 23:09.960]  stands for.
[23:09.960 --> 23:17.240]  Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders came out, we're going to play it in a moment, and said that
[23:17.240 --> 23:23.640]  President Trump is betraying working people, really?
[23:23.640 --> 23:30.960]  I thought it was nap time and get, and selling out to China, besides, you say white people
[23:30.960 --> 23:37.480]  do not know what it's like to be poor when you're nothing but the bum, and worse than
[23:37.480 --> 23:43.240]  a bum, Bernie, you are a criminal.
[23:43.240 --> 23:48.000]  You and your wife swindle universities and steal the money.
[23:48.000 --> 23:56.280]  You traveled to honeymoon in the Soviet Union when they were torturing and killing Christians.
[23:56.280 --> 24:00.600]  And it gets worse, you have your million-dollar houses, three of them.
[24:00.600 --> 24:11.960]  You drive $115,000 vehicles, and you praise Mao and Stalin and Fidel Castro.
[24:11.960 --> 24:14.240]  You are a lazy pig.
[24:14.240 --> 24:22.040]  But before we get to you, and this clip from your rallies, you are now the front-runner
[24:22.040 --> 24:29.520]  in major polls, before we get to that, let's play Nancy Pelosi.
[24:29.520 --> 24:35.880]  She says, oh, there's only a few of them in our party, that is a lie.
[24:35.880 --> 24:40.000]  Just like they told you, there are no sanctuary cities, there are no caravans.
[24:40.000 --> 24:43.800]  It is not a crisis Trump made it up.
[24:43.800 --> 24:51.360]  But suddenly a week ago, they all changed and said it is a crisis, and Trump created
[24:51.360 --> 24:52.360]  it.
[24:52.360 --> 24:53.360]  That's right.
[24:53.360 --> 24:56.000]  So let's go to Nancy Pelosi.
[24:56.000 --> 25:02.240]  She likes to minimize the conflicts within her caucus between the moderates and the
[25:02.240 --> 25:07.960]  progressives, who have these wings, AOC, and her group on one side.
[25:07.960 --> 25:08.960]  That's like five people.
[25:08.960 --> 25:12.880]  No, it's the progressive group, it's more than five.
[25:12.880 --> 25:15.160]  Well, I'm a progressive, yeah.
[25:15.160 --> 25:25.160]  So there's five people in the Democratic Party leadership of the 18 Shang Free Healthcare
[25:25.160 --> 25:32.920]  Free Housing, Free Income, Free Education, all of it costs something like 80 trillion
[25:32.920 --> 25:33.920]  a year or something.
[25:33.920 --> 25:37.960]  It's impossible to talk about the road to ruin, the road to Venezuela.
[25:37.960 --> 25:44.880]  But she says that, no, no, no, that's just a few people, really, in Gallup polls, 50
[25:44.880 --> 25:52.960]  plus percent of millennials and college students say they are socialists or communists because
[25:52.960 --> 26:00.040]  they want something free, yeah, yeah, we're going to get something free.
[26:00.040 --> 26:03.720]  There are rich people, they need to pay me money.
[26:03.720 --> 26:08.840]  Is that why all the shows like ABC News are sponsored by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation?
[26:08.840 --> 26:11.920]  Because they want to get their taxes raised?
[26:11.920 --> 26:16.720]  They put their money in tax exempt foundations and don't pay money.
[26:16.720 --> 26:23.640]  When they say they want taxes raised on rich, that means 125,000 individually or 250,000
[26:23.640 --> 26:25.320]  husband and wife.
[26:25.320 --> 26:32.520]  They just want to get rid of the middle class already paying 65% on average.
[26:32.520 --> 26:39.600]  When the average mega corporation or billionaire pay less than 10% a year, they wrote laws
[26:39.600 --> 26:47.080]  where they don't have to pay the tax and then the middle class almost are the tax.
[26:47.080 --> 26:51.800]  I mean, this is this is the scumbag lecturing is let's hear from him himself.
[26:51.800 --> 26:55.000]  Look, I got Einstein here.
[26:55.000 --> 27:01.560]  Let's hear from him and all these moochers who think he couldn't build a company, never
[27:01.560 --> 27:04.600]  work to the private sector one day.
[27:04.600 --> 27:07.040]  He spews race baiting garbage everywhere.
[27:07.040 --> 27:12.160]  And here he is in front of a crowd of a bunch of dumb white liberals telling him, you're
[27:12.160 --> 27:17.560]  gonna still be the ruling class was still gonna have the Soviet dream here.
[27:17.560 --> 27:21.160]  You've just got to put me in.
[27:21.160 --> 27:22.160]  Okay.
[27:22.160 --> 27:26.160]  Let's do his thing.
[27:26.160 --> 27:35.560]  Trump has told literally thousands of lies since he began his campaign.
[27:35.560 --> 27:42.440]  And since he has been in the White House, but the biggest lie that he told the people
[27:42.440 --> 27:48.280]  of Pennsylvania and the people of Vermont and people all across this country, the biggest
[27:48.280 --> 27:59.400]  lie was that he was going to stand up for working families and take on the establishment.
[27:59.400 --> 28:02.560]  That was a monstrous lie.
[28:02.560 --> 28:11.320]  Well, I'm going to take Trump to the woodshed on the other side of the break, but it's not
[28:11.320 --> 28:15.600]  for what you say, buddy, boy, your little federal reserve that he's at war with is the
[28:15.600 --> 28:19.240]  one that raised the interest rates eight times, never raised him under Obama, trying to spike
[28:19.240 --> 28:20.240]  the recovery.
[28:20.240 --> 28:22.160]  Trump's trying to get jobs back here and trying to do a lot.
[28:22.160 --> 28:24.600]  Yeah, as you pump in the bubble bigger, that's all we can do now.
[28:24.600 --> 28:28.840]  This damn thing's so big when it blows, we're going down into probably a civil war.
[28:28.840 --> 28:31.920]  So I don't blame him not wanting to deflate it.
[28:31.920 --> 28:32.920]  What are you supposed to do?
[28:32.920 --> 28:39.200]  Man, a monstrous lie and free stuff for you.
[28:39.200 --> 28:44.480]  All 18 candidates are offering reparations, or forgot that free stuff thing, reparations,
[28:44.480 --> 28:51.080]  free health care, free housing, free income, free education, free, free, free, who's going
[28:51.080 --> 28:59.800]  to pay for it with all the homeless veterans, come in more illegals, sanctuary cities.
[28:59.800 --> 29:04.800]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels
[29:04.800 --> 29:08.600]  may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[29:08.600 --> 29:13.440]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are
[29:13.440 --> 29:17.000]  just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[29:17.000 --> 29:21.480]  Here how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives

[32:42.760 --> 32:44.760]  I've got two in my home.
[32:44.760 --> 32:49.880]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Elexapure Breeze in your
[32:49.880 --> 32:50.880]  house.
[32:50.880 --> 32:55.560]  Don't live in a polluted major city in your home.
[32:55.560 --> 32:56.560]  Have clean air.
[32:56.560 --> 33:03.560]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[33:03.560 --> 33:16.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:16.360 --> 33:22.040]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[33:22.040 --> 33:48.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:48.040 --> 33:55.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:55.040 --> 34:08.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[34:08.040 --> 34:33.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[34:33.040 --> 34:50.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[34:50.040 --> 35:16.760]  I'm going to take President Trump to the woodshed here because if we don't light a big giant
[35:16.760 --> 35:26.320]  red-hot fire under his ass, all the great work we've done is going to be destroyed.
[35:26.320 --> 35:30.600]  You could say that the number one issue for the president is to defend the border.
[35:30.600 --> 35:35.120]  The globalists are trying to collapse it, and that is paramount physically to the nation.
[35:35.120 --> 35:39.120]  And then you've got financially, the private federal reserve raising interest rates eight
[35:39.120 --> 35:44.280]  times and having the financial press talk down the economy to kill that great recovery
[35:44.280 --> 35:48.040]  we saw that was record level up at 4.8% growth.
[35:48.040 --> 35:54.120]  And once you get growth above 5%, it tends to balloon up to 10%.
[35:54.120 --> 35:57.920]  You know, China's had a 10% growth rate for 50 years on average.
[35:57.920 --> 35:58.920]  Why couldn't we have that again?
[35:58.920 --> 36:00.920]  We haven't had that since the 60s.
[36:00.920 --> 36:03.800]  The truth is, it's hard to hold America back.
[36:03.800 --> 36:04.800]  They've been doing it.
[36:04.800 --> 36:06.320]  The Federal Reserve calls it stopping overheating.
[36:06.320 --> 36:09.640]  Let me get to the meat potato chair.
[36:09.640 --> 36:13.800]  You could say financially, having the Federal Reserve had a spiked economy, that's paramount.
[36:13.800 --> 36:17.880]  But above all, you could lose everything you own.
[36:17.880 --> 36:22.160]  You could even be overrun by a bunch of illegal aliens.
[36:22.160 --> 36:29.680]  But if I had free speech, and I could reach out to them, and I had a fair playing field,
[36:29.680 --> 36:33.160]  I could convert them into patriots.
[36:33.160 --> 36:37.080]  But if I don't have speech, I can't do anything.
[36:37.080 --> 36:40.440]  That's why it becomes paramount.
[36:40.440 --> 36:45.720]  It's before guns, and the right to self-defense, why is that?
[36:45.720 --> 36:50.600]  Because if you're about to use guns to defend your family, and to defend your nation, you
[36:50.600 --> 36:55.980]  need to be able to rally other men and women to your cause, or you'll never be able to
[36:55.980 --> 36:59.880]  coordinate the use of the weapons.
[36:59.880 --> 37:01.440]  It's all elementary.
[37:01.440 --> 37:02.440]  Speech comes first.
[37:02.440 --> 37:07.960]  And if you've got that, you don't usually need the guns.
[37:07.960 --> 37:19.720]  It comes to governments, you need them to fight bad people, rabid dogs, criminals, enemies.
[37:19.720 --> 37:23.800]  So I have this tendency to always go over all my evidence, instead of just saying what's
[37:23.800 --> 37:25.600]  happening like mainstream media does.
[37:25.600 --> 37:29.520]  And so I'll go over some of the evidence on it, but let me just do this for you right
[37:29.520 --> 37:33.040]  up front.
[37:33.040 --> 37:34.760]  I don't say this with pleasure.
[37:34.760 --> 37:43.040]  It scares the daylights out of me that we're basically the only broad jest that has studied
[37:43.040 --> 37:48.400]  the entire architecture of this takeover.
[37:48.400 --> 37:53.760]  Drudge has done it some, zero hedge has done a great job, but when it comes to really calling
[37:53.760 --> 37:59.000]  it, we're over the target, and I don't say that to go, oh, look, we're over the target.
[37:59.000 --> 38:02.400]  That's why they want us off air.
[38:02.400 --> 38:09.000]  What we're saying is the kill shot.
[38:09.000 --> 38:12.160]  Now you're going to hear me say all this and you're going to go, we've been hearing this
[38:12.160 --> 38:13.160]  for two years.
[38:13.160 --> 38:20.040]  I know, but it's in mainstream news now today.
[38:20.040 --> 38:23.920]  And even most people in Congress can't figure out what's going on because they're busy.
[38:23.920 --> 38:24.920]  They're not specialists.
[38:24.920 --> 38:25.920]  They're generalists.
[38:25.920 --> 38:31.560]  They're looking at so many different pieces of news, so many different pieces of information.
[38:31.560 --> 38:36.280]  They're covering insurance and they're covering borders, they're covering military and intelligence
[38:36.280 --> 38:43.120]  and regulations and legal and trying to raise money for reelection.
[38:43.120 --> 38:49.640]  I watched yesterday, I got up at like 5 a.m. and I watched two hours, couldn't watch the
[38:49.640 --> 38:58.520]  whole five hours of the latest Twitter, Facebook executive meeting, and I watched them lie to
[38:58.520 --> 39:01.320]  the Republican members of the Senate.
[39:01.320 --> 39:07.760]  I watched the Democrats read off scripts where they say this and then the heads of those
[39:07.760 --> 39:12.080]  institutions read off their script in a staged event.
[39:12.080 --> 39:15.880]  I watched premeditated lying going on and it gave me a headache.
[39:15.880 --> 39:18.760]  Let me give you the big inch a lot of here.
[39:18.760 --> 39:25.840]  You know what gives me the really big headache is we know exactly what they're doing.
[39:25.840 --> 39:28.640]  Tim Cook is shaking in his boots.
[39:28.640 --> 39:29.840]  He's the guy behind it.
[39:29.840 --> 39:31.440]  He's the quarterback.
[39:31.440 --> 39:33.040]  I'll tell you the coaches in a moment.
[39:33.040 --> 39:37.200]  That son of a bitch, you know, a son of a bitch is a term of endearment.
[39:37.200 --> 39:39.560]  I said Julian Assange is a tough son of a bitch.
[39:39.560 --> 39:40.560]  I shouldn't say that.
[39:40.560 --> 39:46.160]  That chicken neck authoritarian weasel, Tim Cook, who quarterbacks and organizes the takedowns
[39:46.160 --> 39:57.080]  of yours truly, is merging Europe and the U.S. and all of our infrastructure onto Chinese
[39:57.080 --> 40:00.760]  standards of censorship for the new global model of the social score.
[40:00.760 --> 40:02.240]  You already know that.
[40:02.240 --> 40:03.640]  Infowars told you that six years ago.
[40:03.640 --> 40:04.800]  We were the first.
[40:04.800 --> 40:08.840]  The point is, it's here now.
[40:08.840 --> 40:10.320]  So what am I building up to?
[40:10.320 --> 40:12.920]  And I don't do this to build suspense.
[40:12.920 --> 40:17.960]  It's so incredible that even approaching this information is hard to articulate because
[40:17.960 --> 40:21.680]  it's so simple, but so hard to execute it.
[40:21.680 --> 40:28.640]  But Trump doesn't do this, we're screwed.
[40:28.640 --> 40:29.800]  And it's the right thing to do.
[40:29.800 --> 40:35.760]  It's the constitutional thing to do to protect us from oligopolies and what is an oligopoly?
[40:35.760 --> 40:44.520]  It's using five or less major corporations combining monopolies together for super monopolies
[40:44.520 --> 40:47.200]  to take control of society.
[40:47.200 --> 40:52.400]  That's my definition of it, pull up an oligopoly Webster's, please.
[40:52.400 --> 40:56.400]  So we're dealing with oligopolies, or they have another name, they're called combines
[40:56.400 --> 41:01.440]  or cartels.
[41:01.440 --> 41:06.440]  Combines are cartels, or cartels, but they are cartels.
[41:06.440 --> 41:09.160]  So we come back from Bray.
[41:09.160 --> 41:15.360]  My ultimatum to President Trump, by the way, it's not an ultimatum for me, it's the ultimatum
[41:15.360 --> 41:21.080]  of reality, like if you jump off a hundred-story building without a parachute, you're going
[41:21.080 --> 41:26.840]  to die when you hit the bottom, or two plus two equals four, or if you smoke three packs
[41:26.840 --> 41:30.520]  of cigarettes a day, you're going to get lung cancer someday.
[41:30.520 --> 41:34.800]  It's not a threat to the president, it's, I know you're surrounded by a bunch of candy
[41:34.800 --> 41:39.240]  asses, I know you're surrounded by a bunch of yes men lawyers, and I know that big techs
[41:39.240 --> 41:47.280]  flood more cash into DC than the defense complex.
[41:47.280 --> 41:50.680]  But when I come back, I'm going to lay it all out.
[41:50.680 --> 41:57.200]  How many times have you heard me say, by the US government not regulating the internet,
[41:57.200 --> 42:02.920]  it has opened the gates for the UN, the EU, and multinational groups backed by the Chinese
[42:02.920 --> 42:05.920]  to fill the vacuum, and to create the regulations.
[42:05.920 --> 42:12.880]  If our government doesn't create the regulations to say regulations verboten, regulations forbidden,
[42:12.880 --> 42:18.920]  we already have Section 230, we already built the damn thing, it's ours, it's working great.
[42:18.920 --> 42:23.000]  If our lawyers and our government says we can't act, we can't do anything, when we've
[42:23.000 --> 42:30.680]  got all the rights and all the precedent there on a dozen or more fronts, then it creates
[42:30.680 --> 42:37.800]  a power vacuum, and then by extension, all the tech companies then sink to the lowest
[42:37.800 --> 42:42.520]  common denominator, CHICOM control, EU control, and that's why they have all the headlines.
[42:42.520 --> 42:47.480]  Zuckerberg's endorsing censorship and EU control, and British control, why is he doing that?
[42:47.480 --> 42:52.480]  And all the leftists are going, this doesn't make sense, because the globalists have already
[42:52.480 --> 42:57.680]  written the new combines, our government's sitting on the sidelines, and the internet's
[42:57.680 --> 43:02.720]  being taken over, the globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump
[43:02.720 --> 43:07.680]  the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that
[43:07.680 --> 43:13.160]  it lowers IQ, it literally dumbs the population down, and on our quest to bring our listeners
[43:13.160 --> 43:18.320]  and viewers, the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations, first
[43:18.320 --> 43:22.600]  seaweed based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the globalists tried
[43:22.600 --> 43:27.520]  to block us getting a supply of it, so we discovered deep earth crystals, a pure nascent
[43:27.520 --> 43:30.680]  iodine that brought you X2, that's been incredible.
[43:30.680 --> 43:35.600]  Now due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more
[43:35.600 --> 43:40.320]  of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine, but chemists, scientists, and others showed
[43:40.320 --> 43:45.320]  us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine
[43:45.320 --> 43:51.880]  and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[43:51.880 --> 43:54.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible
[43:54.960 --> 44:00.160]  discovery, X3, now available at m4slife.com.
[44:00.160 --> 44:04.280]  I want to say Brain Force is great, I want to say Turbo Force is amazing, it is, but
[44:04.280 --> 44:10.120]  if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it, the fish oil is better than
[44:10.120 --> 44:12.320]  it, and that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[44:12.320 --> 44:18.120]  Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there, you've got
[44:18.120 --> 44:21.760]  the children's, you've got the adults, you've got the krill oil, if you're going to get
[44:21.760 --> 44:25.080]  the full effect, the fish oil, and the children's are really strong, they don't give you the
[44:25.080 --> 44:29.520]  burpees, but krill oil is the best, and it'll give you the damn burps, and I'm just sorry,
[44:29.520 --> 44:31.440]  you want something like this, you don't get stuff for free.
[44:31.440 --> 44:35.640]  The krill is hallucinogenic, it's so good, in my view, I'm not making a medical statement
[44:35.640 --> 44:39.360]  here, but let me tell you something, I eat five canthulets of krill oil before I go to
[44:39.360 --> 44:43.040]  bed, I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[44:43.040 --> 44:50.520]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[44:50.520 --> 44:53.960]  So we don't make a big profit off of it, but you know what, I just obsess, because whatever
[44:53.960 --> 44:59.120]  the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you, I just can't do it.
[44:59.120 --> 45:04.880]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or
[45:04.880 --> 45:09.080]  to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck even take your dog for a walk.
[45:09.080 --> 45:13.240]  Believe me, I know, I spend hours in front of a screen, and then hours in front of bright
[45:13.240 --> 45:20.360]  lights every day, but thanks to SuperMailVitality at InfowarsStore.com, I still have that energy.
[45:20.360 --> 45:24.560]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against
[45:24.560 --> 45:28.720]  the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with
[45:28.720 --> 45:33.720]  the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy
[45:33.720 --> 45:40.960]  and drive, to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[45:40.960 --> 45:44.960]  So go to InfowarsStore.com and get SuperMailVitality before it's gone.
[45:44.960 --> 45:48.640]  This is actually our last run of SuperMailVitality.
[45:48.640 --> 45:53.520]  So I want you to experience SuperMailVitality before it's too late.
[45:53.520 --> 45:56.280]  Unleash the SuperMail in you.
[45:56.280 --> 45:59.280]  SuperMailVitality.com.
[46:09.680 --> 46:16.120]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best selling supplement family in the world is
[46:16.120 --> 46:22.360]  energy drinks and energy supplements, but they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic
[46:22.360 --> 46:26.640]  caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in just a few
[46:26.640 --> 46:28.720]  hours and have terrible side effects.
[46:28.720 --> 46:35.320]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout
[46:35.320 --> 46:37.480]  and beyond system in the world.
[46:37.480 --> 46:40.600]  If there's nothing else like it, you must experience it.
[46:40.600 --> 46:45.160]  It is a total game changer and it comes in easy to use, packaged, mixed in with fruit
[46:45.160 --> 46:47.600]  juices or water, whatever you'd like.
[46:47.600 --> 46:51.720]  Warning though, it's very, very strong, it lasts 10 hours, so take a half pack the first
[46:51.720 --> 46:57.240]  time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[46:57.240 --> 47:16.240]  TurboForce and EnforceLive.com You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:27.240 --> 47:35.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, the end of the Internet is here.
[47:35.640 --> 47:40.880]  Five global megacorporations openly abracking that when they're done, these corporate agreements
[47:40.880 --> 47:46.080]  between China, the EU and the Democratic Party here in the United States, the Internet as
[47:46.080 --> 47:50.960]  we know it will no longer be and all content will be filtered through Facebook, Twitter,
[47:50.960 --> 47:54.160]  Google, YouTube and a few other subsidiaries they have.
[47:54.160 --> 47:57.320]  That's why all the big corporate media has gotten in line, governments have gotten in
[47:57.320 --> 48:03.360]  line, so they've been demonizing yours truly as the symbol of why they want to do this.
[48:03.360 --> 48:06.000]  Here's a few of the articles that are out today.
[48:06.000 --> 48:14.840]  Bloomberg reports, why is Zuckerberg so relaxed about UK online speech rules?
[48:14.840 --> 48:16.760]  That's because only they'll be allowed to stand.
[48:16.760 --> 48:20.000]  It's just like Pornhub has had to porn the world.
[48:20.000 --> 48:23.680]  They helped get legislation through in the UK saying that you can't go to anybody else's
[48:23.680 --> 48:28.360]  website basically, but theirs and use a web ID.
[48:28.360 --> 48:33.440]  It's called monopoly and when monopolies link up, it's called oligopoly, which is called
[48:33.440 --> 48:37.400]  nightmare tyranny, which when it's computerized is called technocracy.
[48:37.400 --> 48:42.040]  And if you go to Davos meetings even six years ago that were public, they said, we're going
[48:42.040 --> 48:47.600]  to build a panopticon global technocracy and a cashless system controlling and watching
[48:47.600 --> 48:48.600]  every move you make.
[48:48.600 --> 48:52.280]  The Chinese government just four months ago put out a press release saying, you will not
[48:52.280 --> 48:56.600]  be able to move a half a foot without us knowing.
[48:56.600 --> 48:58.760]  And that system is being adopted.
[48:58.760 --> 49:03.920]  So by Trump and our government not defending the First Amendment and section 230 and the
[49:03.920 --> 49:09.720]  internet we built, they are allowing the vacuum to open and let the chai comms, the
[49:09.720 --> 49:14.080]  EU, the UK and the Democrats created.
[49:14.080 --> 49:16.640]  Did the US just give away control of the internet?
[49:16.640 --> 49:22.640]  That was the voice of America in 2016 warning and they basically did.
[49:22.640 --> 49:28.320]  They wanted complete control given to the EU and the UN in China, but Hawks clawed back
[49:28.320 --> 49:33.520]  and Republicans have the US with 30% control.
[49:33.520 --> 49:37.200]  You're a radio listener and you don't see all the articles my crew is putting on screen.
[49:37.200 --> 49:42.120]  Why is Zuckerberg so relaxed about UK online speech rules?
[49:42.120 --> 49:45.480]  Because it makes him part of the oligopoly.
[49:45.480 --> 49:49.640]  But looks to remold internet with new copyright rules, AP.
[49:49.640 --> 49:50.640]  That's right.
[49:50.640 --> 49:53.280]  What did Matt Rudd three years ago say after he met with that Supreme Court justice, they're
[49:53.280 --> 49:58.120]  going to use copyright to shut everyone down, but the big guys who are above the law and
[49:58.120 --> 49:59.120]  have immunity.
[49:59.120 --> 50:03.200]  They say they want to be able to show a news article even though it's total fair use under
[50:03.200 --> 50:04.200]  the UN edict.
[50:04.200 --> 50:06.720]  So I can't, it's breaking the internet.
[50:06.720 --> 50:12.600]  So everything's like Netflix, it's approved and all the media, all the corporate horrors,
[50:12.600 --> 50:17.760]  the young Turks, all of them are lining up dutifully to prove their subservience so they
[50:17.760 --> 50:22.120]  can be led into the new golden future, which of course will just get more and more centralized.
[50:22.120 --> 50:27.440]  The globalists put out a press release and a thousand publications were gargagated.
[50:27.440 --> 50:29.280]  But then you're no longer even needed.
[50:29.280 --> 50:33.800]  German data privacy commissioner says article 13 of the new laws they're passing in the
[50:33.800 --> 50:39.240]  EU inevitably leads to filters, which inevitably lead to internet oligopoly.
[50:39.240 --> 50:43.520]  Oh, oligopoly.
[50:43.520 --> 50:45.240]  That's from the electronic frontier foundation.
[50:45.240 --> 50:46.240]  It's here.
[50:46.240 --> 50:47.680]  Let's go back a few years.
[50:47.680 --> 50:52.080]  Handover of U.S. internet control to ICANN, officially blocked in Republican Party.
[50:52.080 --> 50:55.800]  They didn't get ICANN, but they got the global standardization and the other agreements that
[50:55.800 --> 50:57.680]  the president must reverse.
[50:57.680 --> 50:59.440]  So I'm going to explain this right now.
[50:59.440 --> 51:04.520]  Obama administration turns the internet over to the globalists 2014 in FullWars.com.
[51:04.520 --> 51:09.720]  So let's back up here, let's back up now.
[51:09.720 --> 51:15.560]  I'm going to explain this for everybody.
[51:15.560 --> 51:18.920]  We're our own sovereign country and have our rules and our jurisprudence and our common
[51:18.920 --> 51:20.680]  law.
[51:20.680 --> 51:24.880]  We created the internet, the American people and the British people with our scientists.
[51:24.880 --> 51:28.360]  It's like we produced everything else pretty much.
[51:28.360 --> 51:31.320]  Sorry, we sell like that.
[51:31.320 --> 51:35.120]  These innovators, these visionaries, as mathematicians, as scientists, as warriors, as everything
[51:35.120 --> 51:36.520]  else.
[51:36.520 --> 51:44.120]  And so now 50 years after the internet was invented, used by government secretly until
[51:44.120 --> 51:52.800]  about 30 years ago, Soros and all the documents are out there, gets Obama to sign over two
[51:52.800 --> 51:57.560]  thirds of the internet to the UN and the EU and a board with the Chinese on it, Chinese
[51:57.560 --> 52:00.000]  government communist.
[52:00.000 --> 52:02.800]  And now they're setting the regulations and rules.
[52:02.800 --> 52:08.400]  And by extension, that means they build the architecture of Facebook and Twitter and YouTube
[52:08.400 --> 52:14.040]  and Google and all the other big groups that follow suit so they can be integrated into
[52:14.040 --> 52:18.480]  the great hive board, so they can be compliant.
[52:18.480 --> 52:25.440]  And so in the future of the internet, they say in these articles, you will not have websites.
[52:25.440 --> 52:26.440]  Everything will be filtered.
[52:26.440 --> 52:29.440]  What did they say two months before I got banned in the Wall Street Journal?
[52:29.440 --> 52:30.440]  Others wrote about it.
[52:30.440 --> 52:31.440]  It was, hold on to your tin full hat.
[52:31.440 --> 52:33.800]  YouTube is about to ban Alex Jones.
[52:33.800 --> 52:37.360]  They said we're going to ban WikiLeaks and then Alex Jones, and when that's done and
[52:37.360 --> 52:40.880]  nobody defends them, within a couple of years, the entire internet will be paid.
[52:40.880 --> 52:44.400]  There will be a few thousand channels that five corporations control.
[52:44.400 --> 52:47.440]  We project profits in the trillions.
[52:47.440 --> 52:54.680]  So it was a huge 30-page article in the Wall Street Journal admitting all of this.
[52:54.680 --> 52:55.680]  And now they've done it.
[52:55.680 --> 52:57.440]  They've gotten almost there.
[52:57.440 --> 53:00.320]  And I find it really hard to believe Trump doesn't know about this and understand this
[53:00.320 --> 53:01.320]  is big money.
[53:01.320 --> 53:03.240]  This is the swamp.
[53:03.240 --> 53:05.560]  And betraying the vision of the internet, the open free society.
[53:05.560 --> 53:10.160]  See, the internet used to be about what we wanted and what we voted on and what we uploaded.
[53:10.160 --> 53:15.440]  Now the internet's about what they force, feed you to have it be a control system to
[53:15.440 --> 53:21.880]  not just predict the future and know our wishes and supply us.
[53:21.880 --> 53:23.440]  That was just the invite.
[53:23.440 --> 53:25.200]  That was just the first act.
[53:25.200 --> 53:32.320]  Now it tells us what to be, takes control of our lives, makes us betray ourselves and
[53:32.320 --> 53:38.160]  turns us into bots ourselves, creatures of the machine, extensions in machine learning
[53:38.160 --> 53:47.400]  of AI before it finally, in its cocoon, phase two, phase three, shuffs us off, a husk falls
[53:47.400 --> 53:51.520]  away and the new creature crawls out.
[53:51.520 --> 53:53.240]  That is the Illuminati religion.
[53:53.240 --> 53:58.440]  And so now we're going into the cocooning phase, you, your children, your family, relationships
[53:58.440 --> 54:01.080]  are dying, people aren't having children or having sex.
[54:01.080 --> 54:03.200]  They're interfacing with the false reality.
[54:03.200 --> 54:07.520]  It knows what they want, not the real world that actually they spring from.
[54:07.520 --> 54:11.800]  And statistically, it knows what you want like a face sucker, but it makes you more depressed.
[54:11.800 --> 54:13.120]  It makes you commit suicide.
[54:13.120 --> 54:14.320]  It makes you more infertile.
[54:14.320 --> 54:15.320]  It makes you more alone.
[54:15.320 --> 54:18.920]  But it doesn't matter because it's all you're comfortable with now because you've been made
[54:18.920 --> 54:27.000]  so weak until the vampire slowly sucks you dry before it emerges from your body.
[54:27.000 --> 54:39.320]  All that's left is your skin and this new thing is there.
[54:39.320 --> 54:41.320]  So that's where we are.
[54:41.320 --> 54:43.400]  And this is a big idea.
[54:43.400 --> 54:44.400]  It's a big system.
[54:44.400 --> 54:47.520]  It's a big program and it's killing us.
[54:47.520 --> 54:50.920]  It's not the technology itself is bad.
[54:50.920 --> 54:59.680]  It's that this has all been engineered as a program to lower our defenses, to make us
[54:59.680 --> 55:05.600]  hate ourselves, to kill our life force, destroy our dreams and turn everything into a nightmare.
[55:05.600 --> 55:07.440]  And what is the former head of Facebook?
[55:07.440 --> 55:09.240]  Mr. Parker said, what are they also?
[55:09.240 --> 55:13.360]  They said, yeah, we designed it to manipulate you, to make you alone, to play on your weaknesses
[55:13.360 --> 55:17.880]  and make you more weak so we can control you.
[55:17.880 --> 55:22.520]  And then once you're forced online to live, we can now take it away from you if you don't
[55:22.520 --> 55:23.880]  behave the way we want.
[55:23.880 --> 55:27.840]  And at first it's just saying you're a liberal and there aren't two genders and families
[55:27.840 --> 55:29.040]  are bad.
[55:29.040 --> 55:31.640]  Next it's being sterilized.
[55:31.640 --> 55:36.880]  Next it's signing up to have your mind uploaded to the web so that your carbon body doesn't
[55:36.880 --> 55:37.880]  hurt the earth.
[55:37.880 --> 55:38.880]  But really, you won't be uploaded.
[55:38.880 --> 55:42.560]  It will be AI that knows you, that's been watching you for 20 years, that knows how
[55:42.560 --> 55:45.520]  to mimic you, your voice print, everything you say.
[55:45.520 --> 55:53.080]  So your friends and family think, yeah, Carl or David or Carol or John or Sanchez, you
[55:53.080 --> 55:55.840]  know, they had pain and they were overweight and they were whatever.
[55:55.840 --> 55:58.640]  And you know, there wasn't jobs for them anymore, but it didn't matter.
[55:58.640 --> 56:01.720]  Now they're in a virtual silicon system that isn't bad for the environment.
[56:01.720 --> 56:05.600]  And you know, he went in, they uploaded his brain, but you know, you can't have two of
[56:05.600 --> 56:07.880]  those if the agreement is he has to die.
[56:07.880 --> 56:10.240]  I told you 20 years ago they'd upload your brain.
[56:10.240 --> 56:11.240]  It's not going to really be uploaded.
[56:11.240 --> 56:12.240]  It's a fraud.
[56:12.240 --> 56:16.560]  And but say you've got to die, you've got to give up your physical body in this rebirth.
[56:16.560 --> 56:20.520]  And of course, the top scientists are now all over the news saying you must physically
[56:20.520 --> 56:25.640]  die to have your brain uploaded, really.
[56:25.640 --> 56:31.720]  So it's a fact simile, it's not you, it's a devilish counterfeit.
[56:31.720 --> 56:36.320]  So if the president doesn't stop the censorship, of course, they'll lose the election.
[56:36.320 --> 56:39.240]  Or maybe the president is the devil.
[56:39.240 --> 56:43.800]  Maybe the president is like Lucifer, incredibly deceptive, so deceptive he could even trick
[56:43.800 --> 56:44.800]  me.
[56:44.800 --> 56:47.160]  And he isn't going to stop all this censorship and control.
[56:47.160 --> 56:51.400]  He's there to make us think somebody's fighting for us during this long, arduous process so
[56:51.400 --> 56:56.840]  that he stalls us and our resistance long enough so that we don't resist this machine
[56:56.840 --> 57:00.760]  takeover of humanity.
[57:00.760 --> 57:04.640]  Because he knows what's going on and he knows about this larger program and he knows we
[57:04.640 --> 57:07.560]  signed the internet over to the globalist and he knows it's going dark and they're
[57:07.560 --> 57:11.160]  shutting it down and we're very close to this and it's already being phased in.
[57:11.160 --> 57:14.800]  So the president doesn't take action, he's part of it and I'm not saying that's what
[57:14.800 --> 57:15.800]  he's done.
[57:15.800 --> 57:20.680]  But this is the system, this is the plan, the internet's about to be killed.
[57:20.680 --> 57:26.680]  We're about to go into the full surveillance control grid system with people in live time
[57:26.680 --> 57:30.640]  watching what you do on your phone itself telling you what you can and can't see.
[57:30.640 --> 57:31.640]  This is outrageous.
[57:31.640 --> 57:37.320]  I told you 20 years ago they were watching you over the cameras on your computer.
[57:37.320 --> 57:38.320]  Now it's all admitted.
[57:38.320 --> 57:40.120]  What else do I need to tell you?
[57:40.120 --> 57:42.600]  I've just laid out an exact battle plan.
[57:42.600 --> 57:43.600]  What are you going to do?
[57:43.600 --> 57:45.400]  What are we going to do?

[59:53.080 --> 01:00:10.680]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:38.760]  So, the globalists want their final revolution against humanity, what does President Trump
[01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:39.760]  need to do?
[01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:45.440]  I was really mad at him because he was letting the universities ban all nationalist, conservative
[01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:52.000]  Christian speech, but it's federal law, you can't do that or you lose your federal funding.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:57.480]  Well, he signed executive order to try to stop that, now the challenge is taking place.
[01:00:57.480 --> 01:01:03.360]  I intend now to book some college events, something I haven't done yet, have a lot of
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:07.680]  tricks up our sleeves, that's one of the obvious ones we haven't deployed yet, and so there'll
[01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:14.480]  be definite fireworks in defense of the republic, but like Robert E. Lee said, I've never seen
[01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:20.920]  the backs of our Texans, so we're going to be taking action on every front.
[01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:26.960]  But the president has all these lawyers telling him, oh, it's private corporations, the courts
[01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:29.720]  don't like to regulate those.
[01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:37.120]  We have prohibitive regulations that prohibit discrimination, that give third party protection
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:41.120]  to the big tech companies, instead they're going to get regulatory protection from the
[01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:47.440]  EU and regulatory protection from the UK and the Chai comms by following their incredibly
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:53.200]  draconian models, which the universities on the left are ready to merge with here on
[01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:54.280]  the United States.
[01:01:54.280 --> 01:02:01.040]  The operating system of the left and anti-fa is Maoist, they will tell you that.
[01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:04.920]  And so we have an authoritarian control freak problem.
[01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:09.800]  And so again, Mr. President, the claim that, oh, the courts are going to rule against us
[01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:16.480]  doing this, you got to be kidding.
[01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:20.800]  We have cartels openly lying to Congress and censoring conservatives and mass banning all
[01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:24.720]  sorts of House and Senate members ads and reelection announcements off of Twitter and
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:25.720]  Facebook.
[01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:29.000]  We have Project Veritas undercover video showing all this.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.400]  You have Google admitting that, oh, we're not going to let Democrats lose this time when
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:37.160]  they lost the election in 2018 on November 9th.
[01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:44.880]  We have open and shut one day trial, they'd be convicted.
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:46.720]  And then they sit there in Stonewall.
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:54.360]  So they're cartels, they're acting as monopolies and they're allowing foreign governments, the
[01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:58.000]  Chai comms and the EU and others to regulate them.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:02.120]  And so of course Zuckerberg is going to get new protections internationally because we
[01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:08.240]  haven't created or haven't enforced our own laws over what we created, the Internet.
[01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:15.640]  It's allowing them, because we've advocated our authority in advocation like a royal stepping
[01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:18.040]  down.
[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:21.120]  We have just let them run the gauntlet on us.
[01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:27.160]  And so is that stupidity, is that weakness, or is that on purpose?
[01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:28.920]  Because it's bad.
[01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:35.600]  And now only the big five tech companies, Apple, right through to Google, are going
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:39.040]  to be the filters for what can and can't be on air.
[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:40.840]  It's incredibly reckless.
[01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:42.200]  It's incredibly dangerous.
[01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:47.760]  It's a new class system.
[01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:50.600]  And it's the end of free societies we allow it to happen.
[01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:53.000]  And there are so many ways to fight it.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.120]  So many ways to go after it.
[01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:58.520]  We have the big stick of all the illegal surveillance these companies have been doing.
[01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:01.560]  We have the big stick of how they're offshore and all their tax exemption.
[01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:07.680]  We have the biggest stick that Apple and Google have basically got in bed with the
[01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:10.800]  Communist Chinese over the United States.
[01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:14.440]  But that's the globalist model, total disrespect for our country.
[01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:19.440]  But I tell you, I tend to think Trump is just not informed, and I think Congress is because
[01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:23.240]  I watch these senators and I see these House members and man, the Republicans try to get
[01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:24.240]  after big tech.
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:31.320]  The big tech just stonewalls and because of the complexity, what do you do?
[01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:32.320]  It's just outrageous.
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:35.480]  But what's going to bring them down and what they're most afraid of at Google is whistleblowers.
[01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:39.160]  It's going to be the whistleblowers that have already brought them down and will bring them
[01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:40.160]  down.
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:43.800]  That's why it's up to you whistleblowers to get the evidence of the censorship out.
[01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:46.640]  We already have, I know, more.
[01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:47.640]  It's time.
[01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:50.480]  It's time to spill your guts.
[01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:52.480]  Do what must be done.
[01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:58.640]  Show no mercy.
[01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:02.640]  Our grandparents, our great grandparents, they can food during the fall, so they have
[01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:03.640]  it during the winter.
[01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:07.640]  And that's what I'm talking about at M4sTour.com.
[01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:13.720]  With M4 Select, it's the full spectrum of my patriot supply, one of the top most respected
[01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:14.720]  companies out there.
[01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:20.320]  But because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their
[01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:22.400]  other distributors aren't able to do.
[01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:26.680]  But I want to be a market leader and I want you to have storeable food so it's a total
[01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:27.680]  win-win.
[01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:31.320]  We have those incredible sell prices back at M4sTour.com.
[01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:35.800]  On M4 Select, storeable foods, they've got special diet foods, they've got three-month
[01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:39.040]  supplies, your supplies, weak emergency supplies.
[01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:40.880]  They've got so many great products there.
[01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:44.800]  If you've got a three-year supply, if stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:47.360]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:50.440]  We're buying war bonds, bringing great products together.
[01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:52.560]  With God's help, we are unstoppable.
[01:05:52.560 --> 01:06:01.200]  M4sTour.com and M4s Select, high-quality storeable foods, powered by my patriot supply.
[01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:07.960]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of
[01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:08.960]  the Info War.
[01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:15.720]  I'm not sure why it took so long to recognize that the Democrats wanted the endless supply
[01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:18.080]  of illegal aliens to themselves.
[01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:21.520]  After all, most of these immigrants have been here a long time.
[01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:25.720]  They work hard, often in tough, low-paying jobs.
[01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:27.680]  They support their families.
[01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:30.240]  They worship at our churches.
[01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:34.200]  Many of their kids are American-born or spent most of their lives here.
[01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:38.200]  And their hopes, dreams, and patriotism are just like ours.
[01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:44.440]  As my predecessor, President Bush, once put it, they are a part of American life.
[01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:48.560]  We also recognize that immigration is essential to our competitiveness.
[01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:53.360]  We need all the fresh, wonderful thinking from all over the world to be part of our
[01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:54.520]  economy.
[01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:58.840]  And we also name many of the young people who have been educated in our institutions
[01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:03.680]  of higher learning, especially in the sciences, to stay here.
[01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:07.720]  President Trump announced he's going to try to give them what they want.
[01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:14.080]  We are looking at the possibility, strongly looking at, to be honest with you, California,
[01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:21.520]  the governor wants to have a lot of people coming in, refugees coming in, a lot of sanctuary
[01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:26.720]  cities, so we'll give them to the sanctuary cities maybe to take care of, if that's the
[01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:30.200]  way they want it, because we can only hold them under the current law for 20 days.
[01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:34.520]  They can either deal with it at the border and stop it from getting worse, or they're
[01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:39.080]  going to have to take on some of that burden in their communities if that becomes an option.
[01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:43.000]  Again, that's not our first choice, probably not even our second or third choice, but
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:47.280]  we have to look at all options as long as Democrats refuse to do their jobs and fix
[01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:48.280]  the problem.
[01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:51.200]  But now the Democrats are vigorously defending against it.
[01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:55.200]  Do you think this is an empty threat by the president, though, to talk about busing people
[01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:57.160]  from the border into these sanctuary cities?
[01:07:57.160 --> 01:08:01.720]  He likes to create friction sometimes to jumpstart, he says, a Congress that's not acting.
[01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:04.880]  He's injecting fear into our country.
[01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:08.120]  And so if he was looking to solve a problem, he wouldn't be doing things to divide this
[01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:14.280]  country against itself, be aware of anybody that's trying to tell you to be afraid in
[01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:17.560]  the strongest country in the world, as opposed to showing our strength and our courage by
[01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:21.640]  pulling people together to find common sense solutions to solve this problem.
[01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:28.600]  It's just another notion that is unworthy of the presidency of the United States and
[01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:33.760]  disrespect all the challenges that we face as a country, as a people, to address who
[01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:36.320]  we are, a nation of immigrants.
[01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:40.480]  But Governor Gavin Newsom fired back at the president's plan today.
[01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:51.520]  It's illegal, it's immoral, it's unethical, it's sophomoric, it's petulant and it's par
[01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:52.520]  for the course.
[01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:54.280]  It doesn't fit the plan.
[01:08:54.280 --> 01:08:58.480]  How are they going to turn those red states blue and champion the United Nations replacement
[01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:02.000]  migration plan while the sanctuary cities crumble?
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:06.760]  We are not going to be able to get it done under the Republican leadership and Congress.
[01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:12.440]  We believe that we will have leverage when we win in November.
[01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:13.920]  And why is that important?
[01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:18.280]  Because it gives leverage to every family, to every mom who courageously brought her
[01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:21.120]  child across the desert to escape.
[01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:25.800]  Cher tweeted an urgent message of sudden coherence in response to President Trump's
[01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:31.980]  proposal, saying, I understand helping struggling immigrants, but my city, Los Angeles, isn't
[01:09:31.980 --> 01:09:33.600]  taking care of its own.
[01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:38.920]  What about the 50,000 citizens who live on the streets, people who live below poverty
[01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:40.360]  line in Hungary?
[01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:46.040]  If my state can't take care of its own, many are vets, how can it take care of more?
[01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:49.440]  And oddly enough, Cher is right to be concerned.
[01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:55.160]  According to the Migration Policy Institute, Los Angeles has taken in at least 10% of the
[01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:59.160]  United States population of illegal immigrants.
[01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:04.600]  And on that list, Harris County, Texas, or the southern portion of Texas, fueling a
[01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:08.760]  blue wave that is gradually heading into central Texas.
[01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:14.200]  This chart right here shows what type of facilities we'd need based on the number of people coming
[01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:19.800]  to this country illegally on a monthly basis versus the number of days to adjudicate that
[01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:20.800]  initial claim.
[01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:22.480]  And it's pretty shocking.
[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:27.920]  Right now, we had about 100,000 individuals is what the estimate is for March.
[01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:30.720]  About 100,000 people come to this country illegally.
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:34.440]  If we were, if it takes 45 days right now, it's taking about 40 days, I think, to get
[01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:36.640]  that initial determination.
[01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:41.680]  We're looking at needing detention facilities, somewhere about 125,000 beds is what this
[01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:43.180]  chart will show you.
[01:10:43.180 --> 01:10:49.280]  On average, we apprehend more than 1,000 people illegally crossing the border every day.
[01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:52.680]  That's roughly the capacity of 17 commercial buses.
[01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:57.440]  Mexico is a major source country for the transit and production of illicit drugs destined
[01:10:57.440 --> 01:11:02.080]  for the United States, including marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamines, heroin, and most
[01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:04.440]  recently, most recently, fentanyl.
[01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:08.520]  As a result of Mexico's dominant role, both as a source and transit point for illicit
[01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:13.560]  drugs destined for the United States, it's also a primary destination for illicit proceeds
[01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:17.880]  that the cartel earns through their distribution networks in the United States.
[01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:23.560]  What's more, as illegal aliens replace Americans in the heartland, they also replace them in
[01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:24.560]  the suburbs.
[01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:30.360]  As the Atlantic reported way back in 2014, in 2000, more than half of immigrants lived
[01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:33.600]  in the suburbs of the nation's largest metro areas.
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:40.760]  That number is now up to 61%, as more immigrants migrate to suburban communities instead of
[01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:48.080]  urban centers, according to census data from 2000 to 2013, analyzed by the Brookings Institution.
[01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:53.580]  The Democrats want to silence the vote and voice of American citizens, and it's never
[01:11:53.580 --> 01:11:55.880]  been clearer than it is today.
[01:11:55.880 --> 01:12:01.480]  We should provide their sanctuary cities with as many illegal aliens as they can't handle.
[01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:05.800]  Maybe then we could start to talk about some security on our southern border.
[01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:28.040]  John Bown reporting.
[01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:31.620]  The Democrats want hundreds of thousands of months to pour in, but they want to basically
[01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:35.900]  bust them, Democrats have buses waiting to red states and red cities, they don't want
[01:12:35.900 --> 01:12:37.660]  to pay for them, it's a weapon.
[01:12:37.660 --> 01:12:41.020]  And so Trump's idea is, well, you know, you say they're legal there, you overwhelmed
[01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:46.360]  our courts, our emergency beds, everything, you take them, they go, oh no, it's too dangerous.
[01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:49.460]  So he flips the script on them just by making the point.
[01:12:49.460 --> 01:12:54.980]  Another giant caravan just smashed over the Mexican border Saturday and more are coming.
[01:12:54.980 --> 01:12:56.260]  So they're breaking our borders.
[01:12:56.260 --> 01:12:59.420]  Now they call them migrants, that was the old thing when you did have people that lived
[01:12:59.420 --> 01:13:04.740]  in Mexico but seasonally came up here in the spring and summer and fall, you know, to pick
[01:13:04.740 --> 01:13:07.260]  the fruit and all the rest of it in California and South Texas.
[01:13:07.260 --> 01:13:08.260]  That's fine.
[01:13:08.260 --> 01:13:10.460]  They'd be fine to even give them worker visas.
[01:13:10.460 --> 01:13:16.300]  Those are migrants, people coming in from Europe and Asia and Africa through Latin America
[01:13:16.300 --> 01:13:21.020]  and from South America and Central America and collapsed socialist regimes.
[01:13:21.020 --> 01:13:23.660]  That's national suicide.
[01:13:23.660 --> 01:13:28.140]  So it's just hilarious how the president is playing them.
[01:13:28.140 --> 01:13:32.740]  There is part of what Fox just reported minutes ago.
[01:13:32.740 --> 01:13:38.300]  Here's White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders.
[01:13:38.300 --> 01:13:43.460]  Nobody thinks that this is the ideal solution, but until we can fix the crisis at the border,
[01:13:43.460 --> 01:13:45.120]  we have to look at all options.
[01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:49.780]  This is one of them, whether or not it moves forward, that's yet to be determined.
[01:13:49.780 --> 01:13:53.900]  This was raised at a staff level initially and pushed back on.
[01:13:53.900 --> 01:13:56.980]  The president wants us to explore it again.
[01:13:56.980 --> 01:13:59.580]  Kevin Kork, live outside the White House with the latest.
[01:13:59.580 --> 01:14:00.580]  Kevin.
[01:14:00.580 --> 01:14:04.740]  Harris, the president has effectively accused many asylum seekers of simply trying to gain
[01:14:04.740 --> 01:14:08.420]  the system as far as our immigration system is concerned.
[01:14:08.420 --> 01:14:10.980]  He is saying they're effectively trying to skip the line.
[01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:15.980]  He's also said that along with an explosion of illegal immigration along the southern
[01:14:15.980 --> 01:14:21.580]  border, simply have overwhelmed border communities and that means they should be moved.
[01:14:21.580 --> 01:14:25.020]  That's the thinking here at the White House, move them in other places around the country.
[01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:28.580]  Let me share part of it between the president sort of been talking about this ad nauseam
[01:14:28.580 --> 01:14:33.420]  and now he's going on Twitter saying this, those illegal immigrants who can no longer
[01:14:33.420 --> 01:14:38.140]  be legally held, Congress must fix the laws and loopholes, will be subject to Homeland
[01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:42.300]  Security given to sanctuary cities and states.
[01:14:42.300 --> 01:14:46.860]  Now critics, as you pointed out, accused the White House of being frankly cynical and they're
[01:14:46.860 --> 01:14:49.660]  using migrants as a political wedge issue.
[01:14:49.660 --> 01:14:55.820]  In fact, over on Capitol Hill, Harris, some Democrats say the very idea of, quote, dumping
[01:14:55.820 --> 01:15:03.340]  in, quote, migrants on sanctuary cities runs counter to the fundamental promise of America.
[01:15:03.340 --> 01:15:09.660]  The president has no right to spend money appropriated by Congress for other purposes
[01:15:09.660 --> 01:15:12.020]  to ship immigrants all over the country.
[01:15:12.020 --> 01:15:15.660]  Everybody talks about Democrats and Republicans getting together.
[01:15:15.660 --> 01:15:19.900]  We're going to go to Brighton, come back with Millie Weber, it was just a Bernie rally,
[01:15:19.900 --> 01:15:24.660]  one with Caitlin Bennett that's coming up, but folks, they're the ones, the UN advertising
[01:15:24.660 --> 01:15:29.780]  will let you stay here, overwhelm our judges, overwhelm our courts, overwhelm everything,
[01:15:29.780 --> 01:15:30.780]  you have a right to be here.
[01:15:30.780 --> 01:15:35.060]  Same thing that European Union did, they admit they did it and then they go, the president
[01:15:35.060 --> 01:15:37.460]  has no right to ship them all over the country.
[01:15:37.460 --> 01:15:41.660]  The Democrats show up with their own buses and their own trains and their own rented
[01:15:41.660 --> 01:15:47.060]  aircraft and fly them everywhere to red cities and red states to make us pay for it.
[01:15:47.060 --> 01:15:53.860]  No, you little A-holes, you filthy Democrats, you filthy little maggot Nadler, you're going
[01:15:53.860 --> 01:15:54.860]  to pay for it.
[01:15:54.860 --> 01:15:57.380]  You piece of crap.
[01:15:57.380 --> 01:16:01.060]  Stocks and options trading involves financial risk and is not suitable for all investors.

[01:16:57.620 --> 01:17:02.540]  Number 1 International Bestselling Author Matthew David Hurtado's pain was simple.
[01:17:02.540 --> 01:17:07.820]  Lyme disease bankrupted him in 2009, watching bankers take everything from his family.
[01:17:07.820 --> 01:17:12.180]  After building a seven-figure business from his couch, God called him the ministry to
[01:17:12.180 --> 01:17:17.060]  teach prosperity based on pain he could not tolerate in others' lives.
[01:17:17.060 --> 01:17:23.580]  IRS, creditors, car loans, debt, it's the Babylonian system and you have to escape it before it's

[01:17:58.660 --> 01:18:03.540]  There are thousands of ideologies out there, hundreds of different political systems and
[01:18:03.540 --> 01:18:06.620]  most of them are funded by the globalist.
[01:18:06.620 --> 01:18:09.140]  Infowars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[01:18:09.140 --> 01:18:12.660]  That's what a globalist are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[01:18:12.660 --> 01:18:14.300]  I didn't invent all this.
[01:18:14.300 --> 01:18:19.180]  I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana, and what really works for humanity and I'm
[01:18:19.180 --> 01:18:23.460]  simply trying to bring it back and, lo and behold, it's super popular like it's always
[01:18:23.460 --> 01:18:24.960]  been.
[01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:28.940]  That's what a globalist are trying to shut it down so desperately because we have the
[01:18:28.940 --> 01:18:34.420]  light in the dark of the night that sends chills at my spine, so whatever you do, continue

[01:20:01.980 --> 01:20:31.940]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:32.980 --> 01:20:38.780]  Well, Millie Lieber and Caitlin Bennett, two of our amazing reporters, were in Ohio yesterday
[01:20:38.780 --> 01:20:39.780]  in Lordstown.
[01:20:39.780 --> 01:20:47.580]  For the front-runner of the Democrats, he's raised $18 million, doubled his leading competitor,
[01:20:47.580 --> 01:20:57.500]  and in national polls, he is the leader in a record-wide field of 18 different lying,
[01:20:57.500 --> 01:20:58.500]  colluding miscreants.
[01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:03.580]  And she's going to be breaking all that down with us here in a moment.
[01:21:03.580 --> 01:21:10.820]  But I tell you, coming up when I start the next hour, I was really thinking about this.
[01:21:10.820 --> 01:21:14.380]  Obama administration turns the Internet over to the globalist.
[01:21:14.380 --> 01:21:17.740]  That was just four years ago, and Trump's not stopped it.
[01:21:17.740 --> 01:21:23.180]  If that'll be your headline next hour, Trump handing the Internet over to the UN.
[01:21:23.180 --> 01:21:26.500]  And I'm not trying to attack Trump, but that's what's happening.
[01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:28.100]  It's in the news today.
[01:21:28.100 --> 01:21:29.900]  Who's running the regulations against everybody?
[01:21:29.900 --> 01:21:31.820]  We'll talk to Millie in a moment.
[01:21:31.820 --> 01:21:34.220]  First, we've got three new specials.
[01:21:34.220 --> 01:21:40.700]  We ended the huge mega-super sale, but we've got a new sale that in the targeted areas
[01:21:40.700 --> 01:21:45.780]  is just as good and is really amazing.
[01:21:45.780 --> 01:21:52.060]  And that is a whole bunch of our high-quality apparel.
[01:21:52.060 --> 01:21:56.660]  All of our apparel is 50% off.
[01:21:56.660 --> 01:22:02.180]  That's all the T-shirts, all the ball caps, all everything.
[01:22:02.180 --> 01:22:07.660]  So again, I would encourage listeners to understand, if you're on a right wing or national stereo,
[01:22:07.660 --> 01:22:08.660]  you'll get passed on the back.
[01:22:08.660 --> 01:22:11.380]  A cup of coffee probably bought for you wearing an M4 shirt.
[01:22:11.380 --> 01:22:12.780]  Meet a lot of like-minded people.
[01:22:12.780 --> 01:22:13.780]  It's a real adventure.
[01:22:13.780 --> 01:22:16.740]  But if you're in a leftist area, they don't speak Latin.
[01:22:16.740 --> 01:22:18.420]  They don't know what molon labé means.
[01:22:18.420 --> 01:22:21.260]  They don't know what an attorney response team is.
[01:22:21.260 --> 01:22:26.380]  They don't know what a don't-California, my USA is, that's some of our new shirts.
[01:22:26.380 --> 01:22:31.860]  So that's a fun thing is just meet like-minded people and spread the word.
[01:22:31.860 --> 01:22:37.820]  But if you wear an infowars.com shirt in some leftist areas around universities or whatever,
[01:22:37.820 --> 01:22:41.060]  you might get stabbed or hit over the head with a baseball bat or whatever.
[01:22:41.060 --> 01:22:43.220]  So caution when wearing these.
[01:22:43.220 --> 01:22:47.020]  But you know, our audience really doesn't run.
[01:22:47.020 --> 01:22:50.220]  So I've made all these T-shirts that don't have infowars on them and people like them,
[01:22:50.220 --> 01:22:55.820]  but nothing like they do the ones that are loud and proud infowars.com or that Trump
[01:22:55.820 --> 01:22:57.660]  Medusa T-shirt is my favorite.
[01:22:57.660 --> 01:23:06.100]  But the best selling is the in-your-face big bright red infowars.com shirt.
[01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:07.980]  That's the one everybody wants right there.
[01:23:07.980 --> 01:23:09.340]  We have the don't tread on me.
[01:23:09.340 --> 01:23:10.780]  We have me and like a Wolverine.
[01:23:10.780 --> 01:23:20.220]  We have a bunch of great ball caps, 1776, don't tread on me, infowars.com, 50% off all apparel.
[01:23:20.220 --> 01:23:22.220]  And they point out it's annual.
[01:23:22.220 --> 01:23:23.220]  We've not done this.
[01:23:23.220 --> 01:23:30.660]  We've put up in over a year, listen, the dollar isn't what it used to be to get a really fancy
[01:23:30.660 --> 01:23:34.740]  nice designer shirt that's smooth and feels nice and it's made to America and printed
[01:23:34.740 --> 01:23:39.460]  in America is like $12, then to print on it until they're four or five.
[01:23:39.460 --> 01:23:42.260]  A lot of these shirts are $17 a piece.
[01:23:42.260 --> 01:23:44.700]  I sell them retail like $29.95.
[01:23:44.700 --> 01:23:47.500]  When I go 50% off, we're losing money.
[01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:50.900]  Now on an infowars shirt, it's a nice navy blue shirt, but it only costs like five bucks,
[01:23:50.900 --> 01:23:52.020]  the printing like a dollar.
[01:23:52.020 --> 01:23:58.980]  I can sell that for $12, but the others are costing me like $17, $19 a piece, so be sure
[01:23:58.980 --> 01:24:00.500]  and check all those out.
[01:24:00.500 --> 01:24:04.540]  If you see a shirt for like 17 bucks or 19 bucks, it means it cost me that much.
[01:24:04.540 --> 01:24:11.100]  If you see a shirt for 12 bucks, it means it cost me six bucks, but everything is 50%
[01:24:11.100 --> 01:24:12.100]  off.
[01:24:12.100 --> 01:24:15.740]  We go and look at what the purchase order is, what it was, and give you literally 50%
[01:24:15.740 --> 01:24:16.740]  off.
[01:24:16.740 --> 01:24:20.340]  This is the best time and these shirts freak the leftist out, the globalist out, and it
[01:24:20.340 --> 01:24:21.740]  helps fund this great operation.
[01:24:21.740 --> 01:24:25.260]  But the other big sale is $50 off, Alexa Pure Breeze.
[01:24:25.260 --> 01:24:27.500]  We haven't done this since Christmas.
[01:24:27.500 --> 01:24:28.660]  They got more in stock.
[01:24:28.660 --> 01:24:34.820]  I mean, it cost them almost $100 to make the unit, so a $200 deal compared to other filters
[01:24:34.820 --> 01:24:39.140]  that are 500 for the same filter is a great deal, but we'll let you 50% off.
[01:24:39.140 --> 01:24:42.940]  We're splitting like 50 bucks between myself and the distributor, so that is very close
[01:24:42.940 --> 01:24:48.260]  to cost Alexa Pure Breeze, four-stage ion filters, 67% off, two-week food supply.
[01:24:48.260 --> 01:24:53.220]  We're getting that at cost, a two-week nice plastic tote container, hell, at Wal-Mart,
[01:24:53.220 --> 01:24:56.820]  the plastic container would cost as much as this cost, and it's one of those nice,
[01:24:56.820 --> 01:25:00.940]  you know, tote containers that has the clasp and all of it, a two-week food supply, great
[01:25:00.940 --> 01:25:06.140]  to keep in your trunk, keep in your garage, that is at cost right now for one week only
[01:25:06.140 --> 01:25:09.140]  on the filters and on the food at infowarstore.com.
[01:25:09.140 --> 01:25:13.700]  Okay, going to Millie Weaver, and then you'll ride shotgun with this one, Caitlin Bennett
[01:25:13.700 --> 01:25:14.700]  comes on.
[01:25:14.700 --> 01:25:19.860]  I got so much to talk about, what do you make of him, Bernie Sanders being the front man,
[01:25:19.860 --> 01:25:21.940]  raising double the money of other Democrats?
[01:25:21.940 --> 01:25:27.020]  This really shows the Democratic Party, contrary to what Pelosi says, the Democratic Party,
[01:25:27.020 --> 01:25:31.780]  their ethos, their operating system is basically communism as the Gallup poll shows.
[01:25:31.780 --> 01:25:37.700]  Well, you know, Bernie held this town hall, and the whole objective here was to come to
[01:25:37.700 --> 01:25:44.660]  a small town on the outskirts of Youngstown, Ohio, to talk about, you know, rallying up
[01:25:44.660 --> 01:25:49.460]  these unions behind him, behind his campaign, and the whole message he was pitching Alex
[01:25:49.460 --> 01:25:51.540]  was very anti-business.
[01:25:51.540 --> 01:25:58.220]  It was very much like using a strong-handed government to force regulations on these big
[01:25:58.220 --> 01:26:04.420]  businesses and kind of rule over them like a tyrannical communist regime, and the people
[01:26:04.420 --> 01:26:08.260]  were cheering, they loved it, but what many of these people don't seem to remember or
[01:26:08.260 --> 01:26:13.980]  understand is if you look into the history of Youngstown, Ohio, these unions are what
[01:26:13.980 --> 01:26:20.500]  drove the steel and coal mills out of Youngstown, they actually left to other states, and that's
[01:26:20.500 --> 01:26:25.740]  what started the economic collapse in Youngstown, Ohio, nearly 100,000 people left.
[01:26:25.740 --> 01:26:29.300]  Because you're from nearby, you're from nearby there, but that's a historical fact, it was
[01:26:29.300 --> 01:26:33.140]  leftist harassing US industry that ran out to begin with.
[01:26:33.140 --> 01:26:39.820]  Yes, the unions ran out the businesses because they kept on striking, and they kept on causing
[01:26:39.820 --> 01:26:46.020]  all these issues for the businesses, and they ended up leaving one of the biggest steel manufacturers
[01:26:46.020 --> 01:26:52.100]  left the state because they were tired of the unions in Youngstown, all these Democrats.
[01:26:52.100 --> 01:26:57.660]  So Bernie coming there saying, let's continue, let's have these unions, let's, you know,
[01:26:57.660 --> 01:27:02.060]  smash these businesses with an iron fist, it's only going to make the problem worse.
[01:27:02.060 --> 01:27:05.980]  And he sits there and tried to, you know, talk bad about what Trump's been doing for
[01:27:05.980 --> 01:27:06.980]  the economy.
[01:27:06.980 --> 01:27:11.580]  He's hurting the poor people, and of course, he, Bernie, though, helped bankrupt the college
[01:27:11.580 --> 01:27:15.100]  and steal the money, so he knows what to do.
[01:27:15.100 --> 01:27:20.140]  Exactly, and many of these teachers are all upset because they don't have, you know, the
[01:27:20.140 --> 01:27:23.620]  money to hire many of these teachers, many of them are laid off still.
[01:27:23.620 --> 01:27:29.100]  It's been an ever-growing decline for Youngstown because they've never fully recovered from
[01:27:29.100 --> 01:27:30.100]  these steel mills.
[01:27:30.100 --> 01:27:36.220]  But I think Bernie, who never had a free market job, first paycheck 40 years old, I bet he
[01:27:36.220 --> 01:27:37.820]  will fix it.
[01:27:37.820 --> 01:27:42.380]  Oh, that's what he's pitching, he's like, I'll fix it, I'll fix all the problems.
[01:27:42.380 --> 01:27:47.180]  I mean, what I'll say is this, I followed the Hillary Clinton campaign, and I saw how
[01:27:47.180 --> 01:27:51.020]  staged some of her rallies were, you know, they would, they would have these photo ops
[01:27:51.020 --> 01:27:54.220]  to make it look like she had more people there than, than there actually were.
[01:27:54.220 --> 01:27:57.860]  I'll tell you, there weren't really that many people there at this event.
[01:27:57.860 --> 01:28:01.740]  They could not even fill a high school auditorium.
[01:28:01.740 --> 01:28:07.220]  And the other thing was that it looked like many of the people who were, the people asking
[01:28:07.220 --> 01:28:10.660]  the questions during question and answers were planted in the audience.
[01:28:10.660 --> 01:28:13.980]  You mean they were, a communist would plant something?
[01:28:13.980 --> 01:28:15.620]  Stay right there, we're coming up with you and Caitlyn Bennett, we actually have the
[01:28:15.620 --> 01:28:20.060]  footage inside this church, they throw Caitlyn out, and we have a professor that you found
[01:28:20.060 --> 01:28:24.340]  out about, Connie Schultz says, oh, you don't have First Amendment because we choose who
[01:28:24.340 --> 01:28:26.020]  has free speech and who doesn't.
[01:28:26.020 --> 01:28:29.780]  It's all coming up with Millie Weaver, and Caitlyn Bennett will join us and will ride
[01:28:29.780 --> 01:28:32.300]  shotgun as well.
[01:28:32.300 --> 01:28:36.340]  And then, when we start the next challenge, I'm going to take Trump big time with the
[01:28:36.340 --> 01:28:41.220]  woodshed, because, yeah, Obama openly tried to transfer the internet to the UN, he did
[01:28:41.220 --> 01:28:42.220]  do a great extent.
[01:28:42.220 --> 01:28:43.220]  Now Trump's letting him do it.
[01:28:43.220 --> 01:28:44.220]  What do you think all the censorship is?
[01:28:44.220 --> 01:28:45.220]  What do you think all the control is?
[01:28:45.220 --> 01:28:46.220]  That's what it's doing.
[01:28:46.220 --> 01:28:47.220]  Millie Weaver joins us straight ahead, newswars.com.

[01:30:55.740 --> 01:31:00.740]  I want to say Brain Force is great.
[01:31:00.740 --> 01:31:02.740]  I want to say Turbo Force is amazing.
[01:31:02.740 --> 01:31:03.740]  It is.
[01:31:03.740 --> 01:31:08.220]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[01:31:08.220 --> 01:31:11.540]  The fish oil is better than it, and that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[01:31:11.540 --> 01:31:17.020]  Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[01:31:17.020 --> 01:31:18.020]  You've got the children's.
[01:31:18.020 --> 01:31:19.020]  You've got the adults.
[01:31:19.020 --> 01:31:20.020]  You've got the krill oil.
[01:31:20.020 --> 01:31:23.860]  If you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are really strong.
[01:31:23.860 --> 01:31:27.260]  They don't give you the burpees, but krill oil is the best, and it'll give you the damn
[01:31:27.260 --> 01:31:28.260]  burps.
[01:31:28.260 --> 01:31:30.620]  And I'm just sorry, you want something like this, you don't get stuff for free.
[01:31:30.620 --> 01:31:32.980]  The krill is hallucinogenic, it's so good.
[01:31:32.980 --> 01:31:33.980]  It ain't my view.
[01:31:33.980 --> 01:31:35.980]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[01:31:35.980 --> 01:31:38.700]  I eat five caplets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[01:31:38.700 --> 01:31:42.220]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[01:31:42.220 --> 01:31:49.700]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[01:31:49.700 --> 01:31:53.140]  So we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess, because whatever
[01:31:53.140 --> 01:32:03.580]  the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you, I just can't do it.

[01:33:01.500 --> 01:33:17.700]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:17.700 --> 01:33:31.020]  The Alex Jones show, because there is a war on for your mind.
[01:33:31.020 --> 01:33:46.060]  Well, this just in, we have live video for this show, you see, 1100 year old church is
[01:33:46.060 --> 01:33:55.220]  on fire, 900 years old, Notre Dame, there it is, and it's the big news, been on fire
[01:33:55.220 --> 01:33:56.220]  for hours.
[01:33:56.220 --> 01:34:03.900]  There's a symbol of Christendom on fire with the Islamic takeover of France, I think it's
[01:34:03.900 --> 01:34:08.860]  emblematic of what we're facing and what we're dealing with, so we've got the billowing
[01:34:08.860 --> 01:34:16.980]  smoke from the facility built in the 1100s, I would make it 900 years old.
[01:34:16.980 --> 01:34:21.660]  Joining us now is Caitlyn Bennett riding shotgun with Millie, we were both great InfoWars.com
[01:34:21.660 --> 01:34:28.100]  reporters who were on the ground in Ohio yesterday covering burning.
[01:34:28.100 --> 01:34:32.980]  Another event, he came out and said, Trump is hurting working people, there's also other
[01:34:32.980 --> 01:34:37.900]  disgusting clips we're going to be playing, but first off, I wanted to bring up Caitlyn
[01:34:37.900 --> 01:34:42.780]  Bennett, you got thrown out, the full video is on InfoWars.com, we're being totally polite,
[01:34:42.780 --> 01:34:47.900]  and then now Connie Schultz, a professor will tell folks about this in a minute, is saying,
[01:34:47.900 --> 01:34:51.100]  you don't deserve journalism, well it doesn't matter.
[01:34:51.100 --> 01:34:56.660]  They said it's a public event on their website, you're peacefully sitting there, and so they
[01:34:56.660 --> 01:35:01.320]  discriminated against you, but she waves a magic wand, Connie Schultz who defends the
[01:35:01.320 --> 01:35:07.500]  New York Times, I guess a lot about WMDs and all of their lies, she says, I'm not defending
[01:35:07.500 --> 01:35:08.500]  her eviction.
[01:35:08.500 --> 01:35:09.500]  Oh really?
[01:35:09.500 --> 01:35:14.420]  But as a journalist teaching in the journalism school of her alma mater, where Bennett tweeted,
[01:35:14.420 --> 01:35:20.220]  this is Penn State, a foot over self parading around campus with an AR-10 rifle on graduation
[01:35:20.220 --> 01:35:24.820]  day, I am clear that she is not a journalist, oh yeah, because journalists never do photo
[01:35:24.820 --> 01:35:31.900]  hops, she's with InfoWars, oh my gosh, she hid that, you caught us, oh my gosh, so Caitlyn
[01:35:31.900 --> 01:35:34.460]  Bennett and Millie, we were your take on this.
[01:35:34.460 --> 01:35:39.860]  Well, I was really disappointed that I didn't get to hear Bernie speak because I actually
[01:35:39.860 --> 01:35:44.860]  wanted to try to ask him a question, I noticed when I was walking into the event that people
[01:35:44.860 --> 01:35:50.060]  were recognizing me and they were taking pictures of me and they were going to the police and
[01:35:50.060 --> 01:35:54.860]  showing them, so I just put my hood up and I was actually scrolling on Facebook because
[01:35:54.860 --> 01:35:58.940]  I was just getting uncomfortable and I really didn't want attention on me, it wasn't about
[01:35:58.940 --> 01:36:04.100]  me, it was about Bernie, so next thing I know the campaign staff is telling me that I have
[01:36:04.100 --> 01:36:08.940]  to leave just because they don't want me there, I didn't violate any rules, they lied, they
[01:36:08.940 --> 01:36:15.580]  actually lied and said that it was an invite-only event, no it wasn't because there was no one
[01:36:15.580 --> 01:36:21.540]  checking an invite list at the door, it was open to the public and you didn't have to
[01:36:21.540 --> 01:36:22.540]  see it.
[01:36:22.540 --> 01:36:24.940]  Well it said come here, it's a public event on his website, you show that in the report,
[01:36:24.940 --> 01:36:30.660]  but when Beto had his event in Austin, they said you must come downtown and sign up, they
[01:36:30.660 --> 01:36:33.860]  had people on the street saying, sign up, give us your name and number, there were no
[01:36:33.860 --> 01:36:38.340]  tickets, it was all a fraud, so you're telling me a socialist is a fraudster?
[01:36:38.340 --> 01:36:43.540]  Well what I'm telling you is that a socialist now actually believe in private property because
[01:36:43.540 --> 01:36:47.300]  they kept saying it was a private event, so yeah, Millie.
[01:36:47.300 --> 01:36:51.420]  They sure like to engage in communism too, I mean they had all kinds of shirts for sale,
[01:36:51.420 --> 01:36:56.940]  look I think what's happening is these campaigns are trying to mitigate and do damage control
[01:36:56.940 --> 01:37:02.220]  because too many people are coming and during their question and answers, during their speeches,
[01:37:02.220 --> 01:37:07.140]  people are asking them hard questions that these politicians don't want to answer and
[01:37:07.140 --> 01:37:11.220]  don't like to answer and it's causing a nightmare, just like what happened with Beto.
[01:37:11.220 --> 01:37:14.980]  So what they're doing now is they're making sure to pass the mic to plants they have in
[01:37:14.980 --> 01:37:18.900]  the audience, they're very limited and they want to make sure someone like Caitlyn Bennett
[01:37:18.900 --> 01:37:23.420]  doesn't come in there and ask a question that Bernie Sanders doesn't like or doesn't have
[01:37:23.420 --> 01:37:25.180]  a prescripted answer for.
[01:37:25.180 --> 01:37:31.780]  And it was also, we'll get back to this, but a cameo, I'd say 100% a smolleter who shows
[01:37:31.780 --> 01:37:36.380]  up and is screaming the n-word, you talk to people later, it was he was saying niggardly,
[01:37:36.380 --> 01:37:39.940]  which I guess means selfish or stupid or something, but the point is he didn't want
[01:37:39.940 --> 01:37:43.180]  to actually get branded with saying that in the future, he's wearing a mega hat, he's
[01:37:43.180 --> 01:37:48.460]  running around trying to disrupt, this is a classic smolleting event, but that way participants
[01:37:48.460 --> 01:37:52.820]  got to hear some racism with somebody dressed up like a Trump supporter, you guys also witness
[01:37:52.820 --> 01:37:53.820]  that.
[01:37:53.820 --> 01:37:58.060]  Oh yeah, that looked completely scripted, see, Caitlyn was removed, I think they had
[01:37:58.060 --> 01:38:02.860]  a little bit of confusion because there was a grapevine of there's an infowars girl here
[01:38:02.860 --> 01:38:06.820]  and me and Caitlyn were sitting like maybe two or three rows apart and I think they took
[01:38:06.820 --> 01:38:10.940]  her off thinking they saw the problem, well we were there and we saw what they did, the
[01:38:10.940 --> 01:38:16.420]  staged interviews and then this guy running in in a mega hat making sure to scream and
[01:38:16.420 --> 01:38:20.700]  yell what sound like the n-word and then he had to wave his hat in the air to make sure
[01:38:20.700 --> 01:38:27.020]  everyone in the room saw it and then everyone cheers and applauds his removal and then Bernie
[01:38:27.020 --> 01:38:31.420]  has his little prescripted, what sounded like a prescripted answer, he sure knew exactly
[01:38:31.420 --> 01:38:34.460]  what to say and who did he attack, Trump.
[01:38:34.460 --> 01:38:40.220]  This is Trump and his divisiveness in America and you know, it just seems so scripted and
[01:38:40.220 --> 01:38:43.220]  of course all of the mainstream media outlets are on it.
[01:38:43.220 --> 01:38:45.420]  Yeah, well of course we know from the WikiLeaks Hillary pulled the same crap in Chicago against
[01:38:45.420 --> 01:38:47.420]  Trump, these people are dastardly.
[01:38:47.420 --> 01:38:52.980]  Yeah, and I think what it is is the whole, what Laura Loomer's been doing has been so
[01:38:52.980 --> 01:38:57.740]  successful and many other have followed suit and I think they're trying to ruin that by
[01:38:57.740 --> 01:39:01.980]  having now fake bird doggers come in in Trump hat screaming profanities.
[01:39:01.980 --> 01:39:05.420]  Well, let me tell you what they're scared of and I want to get both your takes on this,
[01:39:05.420 --> 01:39:07.660]  both Caitlyn and Millie.
[01:39:07.660 --> 01:39:12.060]  When we had the Bill Clinton's a rapist contest because they were trying to say that Trump
[01:39:12.060 --> 01:39:17.020]  was a racist for out of context comments when Bill Clinton settled rape cases, Bill couldn't
[01:39:17.020 --> 01:39:20.220]  say, I'll tell you what you need to know that you're a rapist.
[01:39:20.220 --> 01:39:22.700]  All those famous videos, that brought them to their knees.
[01:39:22.700 --> 01:39:26.860]  So I want to see it as Caitlyn and Millie's revenge.
[01:39:26.860 --> 01:39:31.060]  I want to see men and women everywhere go to these Bernie events.
[01:39:31.060 --> 01:39:34.660]  He's the front runner and say, Bernie, why'd you swindle that college?
[01:39:34.660 --> 01:39:35.660]  Why do you live a million?
[01:39:35.660 --> 01:39:37.860]  Why do you have multi-million dollar houses like three of them?
[01:39:37.860 --> 01:39:41.180]  Why do you have $100,000 cars that say America sucks all day?
[01:39:41.180 --> 01:39:43.380]  Why do you say why people don't know what it's like to be poor?
[01:39:43.380 --> 01:39:47.740]  I mean, because we need everyone to go confront these scumbags and let their little handlers
[01:39:47.740 --> 01:39:49.740]  know they're not going to stop the signal.
[01:39:49.740 --> 01:39:50.740]  Exactly.
[01:39:50.740 --> 01:39:53.260]  Maybe it needs to be a contest again, Alex.
[01:39:53.260 --> 01:39:56.700]  Well, I don't, you know, we're not a lot of money around here.
[01:39:56.700 --> 01:39:57.700]  Yeah.
[01:39:57.700 --> 01:40:03.420]  But people sure like getting, oh, is it $2,000 every time they said Bill Clinton's a rapist?
[01:40:03.420 --> 01:40:06.180]  So what should we come up with Bernie?
[01:40:06.180 --> 01:40:07.820]  Bernie Sanders is a con man.
[01:40:07.820 --> 01:40:08.820]  I don't know.
[01:40:08.820 --> 01:40:09.820]  I don't know.
[01:40:09.820 --> 01:40:10.820]  What do you say?
[01:40:10.820 --> 01:40:14.980]  Well, we definitely know, I don't know if you guys have seen it, but there's a photo
[01:40:14.980 --> 01:40:19.740]  out there where Bernie is actually speaking at a Ben and Jerry's event, I guess.
[01:40:19.740 --> 01:40:20.740]  I'm not sure.
[01:40:20.740 --> 01:40:26.660]  His podium is actually a remodel of Ben and Jerry's ice cream, but then he speaks out
[01:40:26.660 --> 01:40:32.660]  against corporations getting involved in politics and corporate money and all this stuff, but
[01:40:32.660 --> 01:40:33.660]  it's out there.
[01:40:33.660 --> 01:40:34.660]  He's doing it.
[01:40:34.660 --> 01:40:36.940]  He's showing everybody and no one blinks an eye.
[01:40:36.940 --> 01:40:40.780]  And Millie went out there and asked, you know, his supporters, how do you, do you feel the
[01:40:40.780 --> 01:40:46.180]  burn for, you know, Bernie coming against you and selling out to the DNC and Hillary
[01:40:46.180 --> 01:40:47.180]  Clinton?
[01:40:47.180 --> 01:40:48.420]  And it just goes right over their head.
[01:40:48.420 --> 01:40:49.420]  They did not care.
[01:40:49.420 --> 01:40:51.900]  They just want Trump out.
[01:40:51.900 --> 01:40:54.900]  You are going to get free healthcare.
[01:40:54.900 --> 01:40:59.820]  You are going to get free school, free housing.
[01:40:59.820 --> 01:41:03.420]  You are going to get free money if you don't want to work.
[01:41:03.420 --> 01:41:10.260]  But most importantly, reparations, all white people are guilty and will pay black people
[01:41:10.260 --> 01:41:11.260]  money.
[01:41:11.260 --> 01:41:14.620]  Of course, he will go to the Democrats and we will control the money and get most of
[01:41:14.620 --> 01:41:16.500]  it for ourselves.
[01:41:16.500 --> 01:41:23.820]  How outrageous is it to know that he is the front runner in the Democratic party?
[01:41:23.820 --> 01:41:26.100]  I think it shows exactly what's going on.
[01:41:26.100 --> 01:41:31.220]  You know, when I go to Bernie events, I would expect the crowd to be mostly young people.
[01:41:31.220 --> 01:41:36.260]  But surprisingly, it's older people and I'm not sure if it's because they need that healthcare
[01:41:36.260 --> 01:41:37.900]  that he's talking about.
[01:41:37.900 --> 01:41:41.220]  The young people are only focused on that free college.
[01:41:41.220 --> 01:41:44.940]  I talked to a couple of them and I asked him, I said, what is socialism?
[01:41:44.940 --> 01:41:50.500]  And one of them even tried to tell me that Bernie Sanders base is not about socialism.
[01:41:50.500 --> 01:41:51.500]  He's not running on socialism.
[01:41:51.500 --> 01:41:54.300]  And I'm like, where have you been?
[01:41:54.300 --> 01:41:55.300]  Where have you been?
[01:41:55.300 --> 01:41:58.180]  That is a conspiracy theory and racist.
[01:41:58.180 --> 01:41:59.900]  What do you make of Nancy Pelosi?
[01:41:59.900 --> 01:42:03.860]  She will play the clip and come back actually saying that no socialism are party.
[01:42:03.860 --> 01:42:06.060]  Well, it's ridiculous.
[01:42:06.060 --> 01:42:12.420]  Bernie is an open socialist and the ridiculous thing about his whole rally here is that he
[01:42:12.420 --> 01:42:17.420]  was attacking General Motors and he was saying, let's, let's, you know, put an iron fist on
[01:42:17.420 --> 01:42:18.420]  General Motors.
[01:42:18.420 --> 01:42:23.820]  That's the group that got nationalized by Obama that that groups up Obama's rear end.
[01:42:23.820 --> 01:42:24.820]  Exactly.
[01:42:24.820 --> 01:42:25.820]  Right.
[01:42:25.820 --> 01:42:28.540]  And the irony here though is that Youngstown came in to help.
[01:42:28.540 --> 01:42:34.860]  I mean, GM came in to help Youngstown after Youngstown lost out because the steel mills
[01:42:34.860 --> 01:42:36.580]  all left because of the unions.
[01:42:36.580 --> 01:42:41.780]  So now they're saying, let's have another union chase off the one guy left GM and let's
[01:42:41.780 --> 01:42:42.780]  be clear.
[01:42:42.780 --> 01:42:49.380]  We need to have incentives like that is way love GM needs to move to Venezuela.
[01:42:49.380 --> 01:42:55.060]  I will destroy and swindle all of you with me and my big fat, ugly wife.
[01:42:55.060 --> 01:43:06.620]  You belong to me, America, blood bags.
[01:43:06.620 --> 01:43:13.060]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best selling supplement family in the world is
[01:43:13.060 --> 01:43:19.340]  energy drinks and energy supplements, but they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic
[01:43:19.340 --> 01:43:23.620]  caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burnout in just a few
[01:43:23.620 --> 01:43:25.740]  hours and have terrible side effects.
[01:43:25.740 --> 01:43:32.300]  We have developed hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout
[01:43:32.300 --> 01:43:35.180]  and beyond system in the world.
[01:43:35.180 --> 01:43:36.660]  There's nothing else like it.
[01:43:36.660 --> 01:43:37.660]  Must experience it.
[01:43:37.660 --> 01:43:39.380]  It is a total game changer.
[01:43:39.380 --> 01:43:44.820]  And it comes in easy to use, packaged, mixed in fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[01:43:44.820 --> 01:43:46.100]  Warning though, it's very, very strong.
[01:43:46.100 --> 01:43:47.620]  It lasts 10 hours.
[01:43:47.620 --> 01:43:51.180]  So take a half pack at the first time you take it because Turbo Force is named Turbo
[01:43:51.180 --> 01:43:57.300]  Force because it will take you into overdrive, Turbo Force and EnforceLive.com.
[01:43:57.300 --> 01:44:01.420]  The globalists, the eugenicists are always talking down to us.
[01:44:01.420 --> 01:44:06.180]  They're always trying to make us feel small, to feel insignificant.
[01:44:06.180 --> 01:44:10.500]  They try to censor because they fear you and don't want you to have the right to access
[01:44:10.500 --> 01:44:14.100]  information so you can make your own decisions.
[01:44:14.100 --> 01:44:18.980]  They want you to believe you're powerless, but the truth is, it is we the people and
[01:44:18.980 --> 01:44:25.220]  our ideas and our actions and what we say and what we do that changes the world.
[01:44:25.220 --> 01:44:27.260]  We are the power structure.
[01:44:27.260 --> 01:44:28.860]  We are the inventors.
[01:44:28.860 --> 01:44:29.860]  We are the trailblazers.
[01:44:29.860 --> 01:44:37.340]  And the globalists understand that and they understand that they are basically trying
[01:44:37.340 --> 01:44:41.140]  to control and steal the future from we the people.
[01:44:41.140 --> 01:44:45.860]  Now to help fund our operation that is undoubtedly the very tip of the spear against these globalists,
[01:44:45.860 --> 01:44:50.100]  I want to encourage listeners and viewers to understand that throughout the second half
[01:44:50.100 --> 01:44:55.140]  of the month of March, we're going to have store-wide free shipping and 50% off EnforceLive.com,
[01:44:55.140 --> 01:44:58.420]  something everybody should take advantage of.

[01:45:02.500 --> 01:45:03.620]  need, you don't want.
[01:45:03.620 --> 01:45:10.540]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major
[01:45:10.540 --> 01:45:11.540]  city.
[01:45:11.540 --> 01:45:15.220]  There's some of the most polluted areas on earth, our major cities.
[01:45:15.220 --> 01:45:16.940]  How can I solve that problem?
[01:45:16.940 --> 01:45:21.860]  So we have air filters at infowarstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now
[01:45:21.860 --> 01:45:30.660]  $50 off the Alexa Pure Breeze groundbreaking iron cluster air filter technology.
[01:45:30.660 --> 01:45:33.580]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[01:45:33.580 --> 01:45:37.500]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[01:45:37.500 --> 01:45:41.340]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[01:45:41.340 --> 01:45:46.980]  I've got two in my home, you will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the
[01:45:46.980 --> 01:45:49.620]  Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[01:45:49.620 --> 01:45:54.140]  Don't live in a polluted major city in your home.
[01:45:54.140 --> 01:45:55.140]  Have clean air.
[01:45:55.140 --> 01:45:57.140]  Go to infowarstore.com.
[01:45:57.140 --> 01:46:03.100]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from infowarstore.com, when you spread the
[01:46:03.100 --> 01:46:06.140]  videos, you are changing the world?
[01:46:06.140 --> 01:46:09.820]  It's you that has defeated Hillary and the globalist.
[01:46:09.820 --> 01:46:14.380]  It is you, the info warriors across the planet that stood against the bullying, that stood
[01:46:14.380 --> 01:46:18.300]  against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats that have now changed the world.
[01:46:18.300 --> 01:46:23.140]  And that's why you've been on the team supporting us, praying for us and spreading the word.
[01:46:23.140 --> 01:46:24.140]  You are the info ward.
[01:46:24.140 --> 01:46:29.220]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever that everyone
[01:46:29.220 --> 01:46:34.300]  go to infowars.com forward slash news letter and sign up via email so there's no way the
[01:46:34.300 --> 01:46:40.180]  censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[01:46:40.180 --> 01:46:45.740]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the infowars.com articles, to share the videos,
[01:46:45.740 --> 01:46:48.940]  to tell people by the local stations you're listening to, but the bare minimum you can
[01:46:48.940 --> 01:46:55.220]  do is sign up for the free newsletter at infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[01:46:55.220 --> 01:47:01.460]  We are the renaissance and we are winning.
[01:47:01.460 --> 01:47:08.460]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:47:08.460 --> 01:47:21.460]  I like to steam, I like to bankrupt, I like billion dollar houses, I'm going to pay this.
[01:47:21.460 --> 01:47:27.460]  And I'm waging war on corruption in Alex Jones.
[01:47:27.460 --> 01:47:34.460]  Notre Dame, Notre Dame is feeling the burn right now, we're living the Islamic invasion
[01:47:34.460 --> 01:47:41.900]  do quite nicely, that will teach you, they're feeling the burn down in Venezuela, thousands
[01:47:41.900 --> 01:47:46.940]  starving per week, and you will feel the burn here too.
[01:47:46.940 --> 01:47:52.540]  Once my army of slugs takes over, I am the leader.
[01:47:52.540 --> 01:47:59.660]  I am Bernie Buck Torted Sanders.
[01:47:59.660 --> 01:48:06.620]  We sure showed them in Cuba, the Christians, and in Russia, a honeymoon there, where you
[01:48:06.620 --> 01:48:11.060]  could actually get in a jail cell and kick a Christian's eyes out and stomp their face
[01:48:11.060 --> 01:48:12.060]  in.
[01:48:12.060 --> 01:48:14.860]  I did it, I liked it, I'll do it again.
[01:48:14.860 --> 01:48:16.580]  I am superior.
[01:48:16.580 --> 01:48:18.580]  I am a communist.
[01:48:18.580 --> 01:48:22.660]  Think serious, Notre Dame is an incredibly famous place, if I wasn't going to go to Paris,
[01:48:22.660 --> 01:48:27.380]  it is an Islamic, you know, what a hole now, an Islamic toilet, literally, I would have
[01:48:27.380 --> 01:48:31.580]  gone to Notre Dame, the hunchback, the whole nine yards, built in 1100 and something.
[01:48:31.580 --> 01:48:35.780]  See, my memory serves right, 1100, we pulled up when Notre Dame was built, that sucker
[01:48:35.780 --> 01:48:38.140]  is in flames.
[01:48:38.140 --> 01:48:39.140]  That is too bad.
[01:48:39.140 --> 01:48:44.780]  But it will just turn into a mosque anyway, so maybe it's better, it just totally burns.
[01:48:44.780 --> 01:48:48.860]  Yeah, I mean, I'm not glad this happened, but I'll tell you, it's better than the Islamist
[01:48:48.860 --> 01:48:51.100]  capturing it.
[01:48:51.100 --> 01:49:00.220]  1163, that is when the abuse of Christian devils built that church, an evil, western
[01:49:00.220 --> 01:49:05.500]  beauty artifact that now is on fire.
[01:49:05.500 --> 01:49:09.780]  And terrible footage, that place is up like a Christmas tree right now.
[01:49:09.780 --> 01:49:12.580]  Oh, actually, it's where I live.
[01:49:12.580 --> 01:49:15.180]  I am the hunchback of Notre Dame, Bernie.
[01:49:15.180 --> 01:49:17.220]  All right, let's stop right now.
[01:49:17.220 --> 01:49:21.100]  Caitlin Bennett, Millie Weaver, I want you guys to your own show soon, we're lining that
[01:49:21.100 --> 01:49:23.060]  up, I'm not here interrupting.
[01:49:23.060 --> 01:49:26.820]  Tell folks more about covering Bernie, covering leftists, they seem to get even more rabid.
[01:49:26.820 --> 01:49:29.820]  How are they responding now that Russia Gates totally falling?
[01:49:29.820 --> 01:49:35.460]  Well, you know, I think that the reason Bernie even chose the location for this event in
[01:49:35.460 --> 01:49:40.740]  Youngstown was because Youngstown never really became diversified economically.
[01:49:40.740 --> 01:49:45.300]  They relied so much on steel, the whole city was built around steel.
[01:49:45.300 --> 01:49:49.820]  There's massive, you know, just implosion of economy there.
[01:49:49.820 --> 01:49:51.940]  Everything was great with the steel mill there.
[01:49:51.940 --> 01:49:55.340]  All these buildings, schools being built, people moving in for the jobs.
[01:49:55.340 --> 01:50:00.940]  Then the Democrats unionized and did so many strikes that the steel mills decided we're
[01:50:00.940 --> 01:50:01.940]  out of here.
[01:50:01.940 --> 01:50:02.940]  We're going to different states.
[01:50:02.940 --> 01:50:05.140]  You mean Democrats ruined the place?
[01:50:05.140 --> 01:50:07.460]  Oh, yeah, it's called Black Monday.
[01:50:07.460 --> 01:50:08.460]  Look it up.
[01:50:08.460 --> 01:50:10.140]  It's everyone knows about it.
[01:50:10.140 --> 01:50:15.260]  The steel mills left and basically everyone who worked for the steel mill lost their job.
[01:50:15.260 --> 01:50:20.060]  And the problem was, there weren't any other big industries in that city.
[01:50:20.060 --> 01:50:21.300]  So what followed?
[01:50:21.300 --> 01:50:25.900]  You know, schools shutting down because people are leaving, teachers being laid off, people
[01:50:25.900 --> 01:50:26.900]  leaving homes.
[01:50:26.900 --> 01:50:27.900]  You have a lot of these abandoned states.
[01:50:27.900 --> 01:50:29.400]  Why not just raise taxes?
[01:50:29.400 --> 01:50:32.020]  You don't need infrastructure like Venezuela.
[01:50:32.020 --> 01:50:37.500]  You just have nothing but me and then you, please continue.
[01:50:37.500 --> 01:50:41.900]  So you had all this economic decline in Youngstown that's been happening for decades.
[01:50:41.900 --> 01:50:48.020]  Then General Motors actually came in to Youngstown and opened a factory there to try to mitigate
[01:50:48.020 --> 01:50:49.020]  the damage.
[01:50:49.020 --> 01:50:51.020]  To exploit the workers.
[01:50:51.020 --> 01:50:53.260]  Well, well, that's what Bernie says.
[01:50:53.260 --> 01:50:58.140]  Now Bernie's there at this rally saying unions, we need to strike against GM.
[01:50:58.140 --> 01:51:00.700]  I will not exploit you.
[01:51:00.700 --> 01:51:03.140]  There will be no college or jobs.
[01:51:03.140 --> 01:51:04.140]  You will be homeless.
[01:51:04.140 --> 01:51:05.140]  Sorry.
[01:51:05.140 --> 01:51:11.180]  And then here's what will happen, Youngstown will quite literally burn to the ground if
[01:51:11.180 --> 01:51:15.500]  Bernie gets in and pushes his policies because there are so many dilapidated buildings in
[01:51:15.500 --> 01:51:18.620]  Youngstown because people have left them vacant.
[01:51:18.620 --> 01:51:22.180]  Firefighters are having a hard time because these buildings are being turned into crack
[01:51:22.180 --> 01:51:24.580]  houses and they're having fires in them.
[01:51:24.580 --> 01:51:27.860]  Local government is racist.
[01:51:27.860 --> 01:51:30.460]  Bernie will cause Youngstown to burn to the ground.
[01:51:30.460 --> 01:51:32.860]  What do you think, Caitlin?
[01:51:32.860 --> 01:51:36.740]  We know what's going to happen, we know what's going to happen, but the people are dead.
[01:51:36.740 --> 01:51:37.740]  Shut up, young lady.
[01:51:37.740 --> 01:51:42.260]  I had you thrown out of the event and I'd say you're not real media.
[01:51:42.260 --> 01:51:45.060]  I agree with Connie Schultz professor at your college.
[01:51:45.060 --> 01:51:47.420]  She says, shut your piehole.
[01:51:47.420 --> 01:51:49.860]  Your degree means nothing from that college.
[01:51:49.860 --> 01:51:55.500]  I will let you have one more thing you can say, but she agrees, shut you up.
[01:51:55.500 --> 01:52:01.580]  You know, what's funny about Connie is that she's married to Sherrod Brown who does not
[01:52:01.580 --> 01:52:06.060]  think that post or partial birth abortions should be illegal.
[01:52:06.060 --> 01:52:10.180]  He supports post birth abortions and partial birth abortions.
[01:52:10.180 --> 01:52:11.180]  So it's so funny.
[01:52:11.180 --> 01:52:16.420]  She's sitting here married to someone who represents me from Ohio and she's attacking
[01:52:16.420 --> 01:52:17.420]  me.
[01:52:17.420 --> 01:52:23.260]  She's attacking a private citizen and she thinks that she has some type of grasp on everything
[01:52:23.260 --> 01:52:28.780]  by claiming she teaches at the school I went to as if that gives her any sort of leg up.
[01:52:28.780 --> 01:52:35.900]  So she has the right to say, you don't get speech, shut up.
[01:52:35.900 --> 01:52:37.220]  That's exactly what she's saying.
[01:52:37.220 --> 01:52:41.100]  She's saying that she's a journalist teacher, journalism teacher.
[01:52:41.100 --> 01:52:46.500]  What if one of her students wanted to pursue a career with Info Wars or Fox News and she's
[01:52:46.500 --> 01:52:50.620]  over there tweeting that Fox News is propaganda, Info Wars is propaganda.
[01:52:50.620 --> 01:52:55.380]  And what world is this acceptable from academia?
[01:52:55.380 --> 01:53:02.140]  Well we know that 2019 is acceptable for leftists to come out and just have their bias in academia.
[01:53:02.140 --> 01:53:04.580]  They push down students that don't agree with them.
[01:53:04.580 --> 01:53:08.180]  And that's exactly what she's doing and Kent State needs to do something about it.
[01:53:08.180 --> 01:53:10.260]  Let's talk about the instincts of this.
[01:53:10.260 --> 01:53:11.260]  You're over there.
[01:53:11.260 --> 01:53:13.140]  Everybody knows you don't disrupt events.
[01:53:13.140 --> 01:53:14.460]  You're there to cover it.
[01:53:14.460 --> 01:53:19.260]  Someone recognizes you and a little tattle goes over and tells on you and even the police
[01:53:19.260 --> 01:53:21.900]  will apologize to you and they say, well, it's a private event.
[01:53:21.900 --> 01:53:23.980]  But no, they advertise it as a public event.
[01:53:23.980 --> 01:53:26.700]  People have lost lawsuits over that, but see, Bernie doesn't care.
[01:53:26.700 --> 01:53:30.700]  He's just using taxpayer money and so that's why a suit won't work, but he just really
[01:53:30.700 --> 01:53:31.700]  is authoritarian.
[01:53:31.700 --> 01:53:38.420]  And I saw some of the leftist, mainly obese, Nellie men who really hate women, really celebrating
[01:53:38.420 --> 01:53:39.420]  you being thrown out.
[01:53:39.420 --> 01:53:42.180]  Well, yeah, I mean, it was, it was ridiculous.
[01:53:42.180 --> 01:53:43.580]  I was there to listen.
[01:53:43.580 --> 01:53:48.140]  I could understand if I were disrupting, if I was causing arguments in the crowd.
[01:53:48.140 --> 01:53:53.060]  I was sitting there on Facebook waiting for Bernie to come out and I have these media
[01:53:53.060 --> 01:53:58.500]  people in my face taking pictures and telling on me and I asked, I said, did I violate any
[01:53:58.500 --> 01:53:59.500]  rules?
[01:53:59.500 --> 01:54:01.940]  And he, all he says is no, this is a private event.
[01:54:01.940 --> 01:54:05.500]  And I was like, you can't really say that because it's public property, it's a public
[01:54:05.500 --> 01:54:07.900]  high school, it's a public event.
[01:54:07.900 --> 01:54:09.700]  And he just keeps throwing out all these lies.
[01:54:09.700 --> 01:54:10.700]  So I get,
[01:54:10.700 --> 01:54:11.700]  Well, that's the guy that threw you out.
[01:54:11.700 --> 01:54:13.380]  The cops said, both the cops said, we're sorry.
[01:54:13.380 --> 01:54:14.380]  Yes, we agree with you.
[01:54:14.380 --> 01:54:15.380]  Yeah.
[01:54:15.380 --> 01:54:16.380]  Yeah.
[01:54:16.380 --> 01:54:17.380]  So they were private security.
[01:54:17.380 --> 01:54:18.380]  And they're like,
[01:54:18.380 --> 01:54:19.540]  But they were, they were off to any police.
[01:54:19.540 --> 01:54:21.940]  They were just private security in that capacity.
[01:54:21.940 --> 01:54:22.940]  Okay.
[01:54:22.940 --> 01:54:23.940]  Yeah.
[01:54:23.940 --> 01:54:26.740]  It was really, it was a really upsetting because, you know, I thought they were officers.
[01:54:26.740 --> 01:54:27.740]  I thought they were police.
[01:54:27.740 --> 01:54:31.620]  So I said, so you're taking orders from them, even though this is public, is what it was
[01:54:31.620 --> 01:54:34.540]  described as, and this is public property.
[01:54:34.540 --> 01:54:37.060]  And they really just didn't seem to care.
[01:54:37.060 --> 01:54:42.060]  Well shifting years here, what do you make of Nancy Pelosi will play the club trying to
[01:54:42.060 --> 01:54:43.060]  distance herself?
[01:54:43.060 --> 01:54:46.820]  I said, there's only five socialists in the Democratic Party leadership.
[01:54:46.820 --> 01:54:49.820]  My God, they're all pushing socialism and communism.
[01:54:49.820 --> 01:54:52.620]  The Gallup poll shows half of them identify as communists.
[01:54:52.620 --> 01:54:53.620]  Here's the clip.
[01:54:53.620 --> 01:54:59.460]  This is not a private event on his website and we'll pull up and we'll put a little
[01:54:59.460 --> 01:55:00.460]  screen.
[01:55:00.460 --> 01:55:04.900]  He likes to minimize the conflicts within her caucus between the moderates and the
[01:55:04.900 --> 01:55:10.780]  progressives who have these wings, AOC and her group on one side.
[01:55:10.780 --> 01:55:12.780]  That's like five people.
[01:55:12.780 --> 01:55:14.780]  No, it's the progressive group.
[01:55:14.780 --> 01:55:15.780]  It's more than five.
[01:55:15.780 --> 01:55:16.780]  I'm a progressive.
[01:55:16.780 --> 01:55:17.780]  Yeah.
[01:55:17.780 --> 01:55:22.060]  So there's only five socialists or communists in the Democratic Party leadership.
[01:55:22.060 --> 01:55:23.060]  Caitlin and Melinda.
[01:55:23.060 --> 01:55:25.740]  Oh, what a bunch of baloney.
[01:55:25.740 --> 01:55:30.340]  These Democrat politicians just can straight lie through their teeth with a fake plastic
[01:55:30.340 --> 01:55:33.180]  smile on their face like Nancy Pelosi.
[01:55:33.180 --> 01:55:34.180]  It's ridiculous.
[01:55:34.180 --> 01:55:38.940]  They're all pushing for free healthcare, free college, you know, free this.
[01:55:38.940 --> 01:55:42.260]  Let's open up the free benefits to even non U.S.
[01:55:42.260 --> 01:55:44.820]  But at least AOC really shows the real face.
[01:55:44.820 --> 01:55:47.980]  I mean, how could she look like the Grants and Stole Christmas in every shot?
[01:55:47.980 --> 01:55:48.980]  It's like a...
[01:55:48.980 --> 01:55:53.340]  I mean, I couldn't even do these faces.
[01:55:53.340 --> 01:55:55.340]  Oh my gosh.
[01:55:55.340 --> 01:56:01.140]  It was more scary than, you know, the thought of socialism was Nancy Pelosi's face in that
[01:56:01.140 --> 01:56:02.340]  clip we just saw.
[01:56:02.340 --> 01:56:04.100]  Like that was so disturbing.
[01:56:04.100 --> 01:56:05.540]  I didn't even know who it was at first.
[01:56:05.540 --> 01:56:08.100]  It was complete plastic, like you said.
[01:56:08.100 --> 01:56:13.980]  But I think that she knows that socialism is detrimental to the country.
[01:56:13.980 --> 01:56:16.540]  So she probably does want to distance herself from it.
[01:56:16.540 --> 01:56:21.020]  But she can't really come out and say like socialism is bad.
[01:56:21.020 --> 01:56:24.380]  You know, it's only five people because she doesn't want to offend them because they don't
[01:56:24.380 --> 01:56:28.660]  need to stick together to get their points across or implement free healthcare.
[01:56:28.660 --> 01:56:33.180]  So if Nancy Pelosi comes out and tries to make it as if free healthcare isn't a socialist
[01:56:33.180 --> 01:56:35.860]  idea, then more people are going to accept it.
[01:56:35.860 --> 01:56:36.860]  Yeah.
[01:56:36.860 --> 01:56:37.860]  I think you're right.
[01:56:37.860 --> 01:56:38.860]  Sorry.
[01:56:38.860 --> 01:56:39.860]  Go ahead.
[01:56:39.860 --> 01:56:40.860]  I mean, I think it's emblematic that...
[01:56:40.860 --> 01:56:45.940]  Nothing is old people, but I mean, the Democratic Party is like a bunch of weird, obviously
[01:56:45.940 --> 01:56:52.700]  drug addicts, geriatrics, but they're in power so the system keeps backing them, but
[01:56:52.700 --> 01:56:53.700]  they're pathetic.
[01:56:53.700 --> 01:56:54.700]  Yeah.
[01:56:54.700 --> 01:57:06.500]  I mean, sorry, Nancy Pelosi is just a dino that's trying to be cool and, you know, you
[01:57:06.500 --> 01:57:13.140]  know, throw out all these little cool words to the millennial base, like, I'm a progressive,
[01:57:13.140 --> 01:57:14.460]  sanctuary cities.
[01:57:14.460 --> 01:57:17.900]  She's just trying to appeal to millennials and she's being fake.
[01:57:17.900 --> 01:57:18.900]  I mean, her face...
[01:57:18.900 --> 01:57:20.900]  Well, let me ask you about that.
[01:57:20.900 --> 01:57:23.740]  Democrats now say, do not bring the illegals to us.
[01:57:23.740 --> 01:57:25.580]  You are going to keep them.
[01:57:25.580 --> 01:57:28.820]  So when we come back to talk about it, I'm going to stop them burning.
[01:57:28.820 --> 01:57:29.820]  It's out of control.
[01:57:29.820 --> 01:57:30.820]  It's very addictive.
[01:57:30.820 --> 01:57:35.260]  Can you imagine actually walking around and I pulled up on $120,000 Audi.
[01:57:35.260 --> 01:57:42.700]  I have three $1 million houses, but I'm going to tell you America stops, okay, we'll be
[01:57:42.700 --> 01:57:47.260]  right back with the third hour.
[01:57:47.260 --> 01:57:49.540]  If you're not expanding, you're imploding.
[01:57:49.540 --> 01:57:51.260]  There is no set stasis.
[01:57:51.260 --> 01:57:52.500]  There is no managed system.
[01:57:52.500 --> 01:57:54.100]  There is no uncontenual.
[01:57:54.100 --> 01:57:57.380]  The continuum is always launching forward in the future.
[01:57:57.380 --> 01:58:00.700]  So you support us and get creative and get fired up.
[01:58:00.700 --> 01:58:01.940]  We won't just be here a hundred years.
[01:58:01.940 --> 01:58:02.940]  We'll be here forever.
[01:58:02.940 --> 01:58:07.500]  And the whole thing around our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases and God knows
[01:58:07.500 --> 01:58:10.860]  what are going to look back and say, you know, we struggled here.
[01:58:10.860 --> 01:58:11.860]  We made it.
[01:58:11.860 --> 01:58:13.220]  And that's really where this goes.
[01:58:13.220 --> 01:58:15.460]  God's got a big war for you ready.
[01:58:15.460 --> 01:58:19.100]  And so if you can't face George Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mao
[01:58:19.100 --> 01:58:22.540]  Seitang, are you going to really be able to face the other stuff?
[01:58:22.540 --> 01:58:26.860]  Because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and are also
[01:58:26.860 --> 01:58:27.860]  ready to fight.
[01:58:27.860 --> 01:58:30.460]  You don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back.
[01:58:30.460 --> 01:58:32.460]  And I mean, I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future.
[01:58:32.460 --> 01:58:36.100]  I mean, all I know is I want to go with the master built.
[01:58:36.100 --> 01:58:37.300]  I want to go to the next level.
[01:58:37.300 --> 01:58:41.900]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced, not these devil worshipers.
[01:58:41.900 --> 01:58:44.540]  They're cold and failed and feels like being in a tomb.
[01:58:44.540 --> 01:58:45.660]  I want life.
[01:58:45.660 --> 01:58:48.580]  I want Jesus.
[01:58:48.580 --> 01:58:53.460]  There are thousands of ideologies out there, hundreds of different political systems.
[01:58:53.460 --> 01:58:56.540]  And most of them are funded by the globalist.
[01:58:56.540 --> 01:58:59.140]  Info wars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[01:58:59.140 --> 01:59:02.580]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[01:59:02.580 --> 01:59:04.220]  I didn't invent all this.
[01:59:04.220 --> 01:59:09.000]  I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana and what really works for humanity.
[01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:10.500]  And I'm simply trying to bring it back.
[01:59:10.500 --> 01:59:14.900]  And lo and behold, it's super popular like it's always been.
[01:59:14.900 --> 01:59:18.860]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately because we have the
[01:59:18.860 --> 01:59:22.740]  light in the dark of the night that sends chills up my spine.
[01:59:22.740 --> 01:59:27.260]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and info wars by buying the great products
[01:59:27.260 --> 01:59:31.700]  at info wars store.com by spreading the articles by spreading the videos and by praying for
[01:59:31.700 --> 01:59:36.300]  this operation and for praying for this nation and the world for peace and discernment for
[01:59:36.300 --> 01:59:38.340]  myself and the whole info wars family.
[01:59:38.340 --> 01:59:44.180]  I want to thank all of you for what you've done because without you info wars is nothing.
[01:59:44.180 --> 02:00:08.980]  You are the info war and I salute you, you're listening to the Alex Jones show live from

[03:09:26.140 --> 03:09:30.980]  Not a word about Assange, nothing coming out of his mouth.
[03:09:30.980 --> 03:09:37.820]  The only Democratic candidate that spoke out in favor of Assange is Tulsi Gabbard, and that's
[03:09:37.820 --> 03:09:44.580]  the only one I'm standing behind so far, that arrogant, arrogant, nothing BS Bernie, the
[03:09:44.580 --> 03:09:48.260]  war monger in sheep's clothing.
[03:09:48.260 --> 03:09:52.940]  The clown of a boy that couldn't fight his way out of a paper bag, yeah, that's the kind
[03:09:52.940 --> 03:09:58.020]  of guy they wanted to put a bullying zone around school when we were growing up, because
[03:09:58.020 --> 03:10:02.860]  that's the kind of kid that would get beat up because he couldn't stand up for himself.
[03:10:02.860 --> 03:10:09.720]  Yeah, that's the guy that gave us that Kosovo war when Clinton launched that illegal war.
[03:10:09.720 --> 03:10:13.980]  This is the guy that didn't want Congress to vote to go into Afghanistan.
[03:10:13.980 --> 03:10:20.020]  That BS Bernie going back to info wars and supporting it.
[03:10:20.020 --> 03:10:25.700]  And yeah, if you don't do it, that's all you're going to get is the crap, the junk that's
[03:10:25.700 --> 03:10:32.340]  being shoved down our throat by the mainstream media that's making you dumber by the minute.
[03:10:32.340 --> 03:10:43.540]  Why would anybody with a brain that big, repeat, repeat what Rachel Maddow said, repeat what
[03:10:43.540 --> 03:10:54.140]  Sean Hannity said, repeat what Chris Cuomo said, what, what person with a brain between
[03:10:54.140 --> 03:10:58.500]  their ears would repeat that garbage?
[03:10:58.500 --> 03:11:10.140]  I'll tell you who the same morons that believed Obama and Bush, yep, that's the ones.
[03:11:10.140 --> 03:11:12.980]  And I got my problems with Trump.
[03:11:12.980 --> 03:11:20.980]  Again, I support Trump totally, totally 100% on the border issues, 100% on the trading
[03:11:20.980 --> 03:11:27.980]  tariff issues, 0% on a lot of his foreign policy.
[03:11:27.980 --> 03:11:35.340]  Going back to supporting info was I got my super male vitality that keeps me rocking.
[03:11:35.340 --> 03:11:39.820]  Anyway, moving on to some other information.
[03:11:39.820 --> 03:11:48.820]  The markets, the markets, as you all know, been on Alex Jones for many, many years and
[03:11:48.820 --> 03:11:54.540]  we have the Trends Journal magazine and we do trend alerts each week.
[03:11:54.540 --> 03:12:00.100]  Our trend alert a couple of months ago.
[03:12:00.100 --> 03:12:04.940]  No recession, Trump bump.
[03:12:04.940 --> 03:12:06.620]  And that's where we're at.
[03:12:06.620 --> 03:12:09.180]  No recession in sight.
[03:12:09.180 --> 03:12:10.380]  Everyone's saying that now.
[03:12:10.380 --> 03:12:18.060]  We had an economic 9-11 back in September 2018 when it will raise those interest rates
[03:12:18.060 --> 03:12:23.980]  but now that those rates are coming down, the markets are going up and going up around
[03:12:23.980 --> 03:12:30.460]  the world because they're all doing the same thing, pushing down those interest rates and
[03:12:30.460 --> 03:12:35.020]  the United States could lower them nine times.
[03:12:35.020 --> 03:12:37.180]  Can't do that in most countries.
[03:12:37.180 --> 03:12:39.300]  So here you go.
[03:12:39.300 --> 03:12:43.660]  Global rally in stocks gathers momentum.
[03:12:43.660 --> 03:12:45.620]  This is today's Wall Street Journal.
[03:12:45.620 --> 03:12:53.820]  Global stocks are rising at the fastest pace in decades as growth around the world slows.
[03:12:53.820 --> 03:13:00.900]  Breathing many investors questioning how much longer the market could defy the gravity of
[03:13:00.900 --> 03:13:04.460]  the underlying economics.
[03:13:04.460 --> 03:13:09.500]  The underlying economics only count a little bit when the central banksters are in charge
[03:13:09.500 --> 03:13:10.500]  of the deal.
[03:13:10.500 --> 03:13:15.780]  And their deal is to keep pumping in that monetary methadone.
[03:13:15.780 --> 03:13:20.060]  And that's what they're going to keep shooting into the system to keep it rocking.
[03:13:20.060 --> 03:13:26.420]  But what you also have, very, very important, you have volume pretty low.
[03:13:26.420 --> 03:13:30.260]  So a lot of people aren't in the markets at this time, so it's pushing it up and valuations
[03:13:30.260 --> 03:13:32.260]  is still pretty high.
[03:13:32.260 --> 03:13:37.860]  But absent a wild card event, we keep seeing that Trump bump bumping a little higher, bumping
[03:13:37.860 --> 03:13:42.380]  a little higher and the higher is here.
[03:13:42.380 --> 03:13:51.460]  The S&P 500 has risen 16 percent, vaulting above the level where banks ranging from Morgan
[03:13:51.460 --> 03:13:57.220]  Stanley to Barclays expected it to end this year.
[03:13:57.220 --> 03:14:04.460]  So the market strength is real because they're going to again keep that money flowing in.
[03:14:04.460 --> 03:14:10.300]  And it's going to be pushed in from around the world.
[03:14:10.300 --> 03:14:13.460]  Governor sees limits on rate estimates.
[03:14:13.460 --> 03:14:18.900]  Estimates of Canada's neutral interest rate are meant to provide a sense of where monetary
[03:14:18.900 --> 03:14:28.220]  policy could end up and shouldn't be seen as a near-term target bank of Canada.
[03:14:28.220 --> 03:14:33.220]  Governor Stephen Polots said Saturday.
[03:14:33.220 --> 03:14:39.100]  The point of the story is they change an air tune because now what they're saying is the
[03:14:39.100 --> 03:14:44.060]  language shifted during the central bank's March press release, which followed a series
[03:14:44.060 --> 03:14:53.460]  of weak economic data with policymakers saying the outlook continued to warrant a policy rate
[03:14:53.460 --> 03:14:56.540]  below neutral range.
[03:14:56.540 --> 03:15:01.940]  What a policy rate below neutral range means is that if everything's cool, we're going
[03:15:01.940 --> 03:15:08.100]  to lower interest rates anyway to keep that market going.
[03:15:08.100 --> 03:15:09.940]  And that's what they're going to do.
[03:15:09.940 --> 03:15:15.740]  They're not only going to do it in Canada, the Canadian economy slowed during the fourth
[03:15:15.740 --> 03:15:24.420]  quarter of last year, which the Bank of Canada has said was sharper and more broad than it
[03:15:24.420 --> 03:15:28.220]  had anticipated.
[03:15:28.220 --> 03:15:30.540]  So what are they going to do?
[03:15:30.540 --> 03:15:33.100]  They're going to lower interest rates.
[03:15:33.100 --> 03:15:40.260]  They're going to lower interest rates to prop up the economy.
[03:15:40.260 --> 03:15:46.020]  They're going to do it and are doing it around the world.
[03:15:46.020 --> 03:15:49.820]  So that's what to look for.
[03:15:49.820 --> 03:15:53.380]  And there's more to come and we're back to tell you.
[03:15:53.380 --> 03:15:57.180]  Pain in my neck, back and shoulders has really gotten worse.

[03:20:28.540 --> 03:20:34.420]  Hey, thanks for having me, I'm Alex Jones show.
[03:20:34.420 --> 03:20:40.700]  It's wonderful being here and again, do what you can to keep the truth and freedom alive,
[03:20:40.700 --> 03:20:47.540]  put your money where your heart and mind are and do what you can and support info wars.

[03:20:52.700 --> 03:20:53.700]  are.
[03:20:53.700 --> 03:20:55.300]  So, what do we got going on here?
[03:20:55.300 --> 03:20:59.340]  I was talking about the economy and interest rates.
[03:20:59.340 --> 03:21:04.700]  This is in today's financial times, Trump attacks on Fed stir global concerns to central
[03:21:04.700 --> 03:21:06.540]  banks independence.
[03:21:06.540 --> 03:21:11.100]  There is no independence with the central banks.
[03:21:11.100 --> 03:21:16.580]  They're only dependent on the banksters who they are part of the deal with.
[03:21:16.580 --> 03:21:24.660]  So here's the deal, you go back to the Nixon days and the Fed share burns was told by Nixon
[03:21:24.660 --> 03:21:29.900]  what to do and not to raise interest rates and he didn't, Paul Volcker came out with
[03:21:29.900 --> 03:21:35.940]  a book that's a fellow reserve chairman under Reagan and in that book he says he was brought
[03:21:35.940 --> 03:21:41.220]  into the White House, they sat in the library, James Baker, the chief of staff called him
[03:21:41.220 --> 03:21:42.220]  in.
[03:21:42.220 --> 03:21:47.220]  With Reagan sitting next to Baker, he said to Volcker, the president doesn't want you
[03:21:47.220 --> 03:21:50.860]  to raise interest rates before election day.
[03:21:50.860 --> 03:21:57.980]  So let's go back to the economy, whether it's in India, whether it's in Turkey, whether
[03:21:57.980 --> 03:22:05.900]  it's in the US, whether it's in Argentina, whether it's in Russia, the head of the government
[03:22:05.900 --> 03:22:09.020]  is the head of the central bank.
[03:22:09.020 --> 03:22:14.060]  The central banks work hand in hand with the government, they're not separate entities and
[03:22:14.060 --> 03:22:18.940]  of course we all know, those of you who watch Alex Jones, that the Federal Reserve is as
[03:22:18.940 --> 03:22:23.540]  Federal is Federal Express, it's a private group, private organization.
[03:22:23.540 --> 03:22:27.500]  So now what do we have here, here's what we have.
[03:22:27.500 --> 03:22:34.260]  The elections coming up, the 2020 presidential reality show, Trump is going to do everything
[03:22:34.260 --> 03:22:38.060]  he can to get reelected and a cat's in the real estate business.
[03:22:38.060 --> 03:22:40.100]  So what does that mean?
[03:22:40.100 --> 03:22:47.700]  He knows that when interest rates go up, real estate goes down and go back to 1992 with
[03:22:47.700 --> 03:22:54.740]  the Clinton running for president, the slogan they used to have in campaign headquarters,
[03:22:54.740 --> 03:22:57.300]  it's the economy, stupid.
[03:22:57.300 --> 03:23:02.060]  And that's all it is, folks, it's the economy.
[03:23:02.060 --> 03:23:07.580]  Trump wants a strong economy, he's going to do everything he can to make it strong.
[03:23:07.580 --> 03:23:11.500]  And interest rates are going to be one of those things that are going to keep it strong.
[03:23:11.500 --> 03:23:13.620]  So they're going to lower interest rates.
[03:23:13.620 --> 03:23:20.860]  I forecast that the 30-year mortgage, for example, now at around 4.4 is going to be
[03:23:20.860 --> 03:23:27.260]  under 4 by election day 2020.
[03:23:27.260 --> 03:23:30.820]  Also staying on the chum.
[03:23:30.820 --> 03:23:45.500]  At this point, I believe as things exist now, he will win the 2020 election for few reasons.
[03:23:45.500 --> 03:23:50.100]  Number one, the primary one, the economy.
[03:23:50.100 --> 03:23:58.940]  Number two, the border.
[03:23:58.940 --> 03:24:08.540]  Number three, I believe that we will have ended the war in Afghanistan and there will
[03:24:08.540 --> 03:24:15.540]  be a peace treaty with North Korea.
[03:24:15.540 --> 03:24:22.740]  And number four, a strong tariff deal and trade deal that will help bring more jobs
[03:24:22.740 --> 03:24:28.660]  back to America, because these things are going to be an ongoing negotiation.
[03:24:28.660 --> 03:24:37.380]  If a Democrat was in office like an Obama that was favorable to the media, there would
[03:24:37.380 --> 03:24:45.620]  be championing Obama by having a trade deal that benefits the United States rather than
[03:24:45.620 --> 03:24:49.700]  communist China.
[03:24:49.700 --> 03:24:52.140]  So why will Trump win?
[03:24:52.140 --> 03:24:59.780]  He'll probably lose the popular vote, but he'll win the swing states, particularly on
[03:24:59.780 --> 03:25:05.940]  the issues of the economy, on the issues of the border war.
[03:25:05.940 --> 03:25:10.420]  People don't want more people coming in that they have to pay for.
[03:25:10.420 --> 03:25:11.620]  It's as simple as that.
[03:25:11.620 --> 03:25:15.100]  We can't pay for ourselves.
[03:25:15.100 --> 03:25:28.100]  So by the presidential reality show heating up by then, we will also see in 2020 more
[03:25:28.100 --> 03:25:33.140]  moves by the administration to rebuild our infrastructure.
[03:25:33.140 --> 03:25:40.500]  And who knows, not only ending the war in Afghanistan, but possibly even bringing home
[03:25:40.500 --> 03:25:43.060]  the troops and closing some bases.
[03:25:43.060 --> 03:25:48.420]  That's far-fetched because that's one of my beliefs in occupied peace.
[03:25:48.420 --> 03:25:56.060]  But looking at the overall picture, and again, we were the first magazine, the Trends Journal,
[03:25:56.060 --> 03:26:10.100]  it's in print that called Trump the winner of the 2016 election in May of 2016, when
[03:26:10.100 --> 03:26:17.940]  all the polls and all the major media were going against it.
[03:26:17.940 --> 03:26:30.660]  The issue that's going to hurt Trump the most is that medical issue.
[03:26:30.660 --> 03:26:33.940]  Healthcare is off the charts.
[03:26:33.940 --> 03:26:37.060]  I just had a good friend of mine.
[03:26:37.060 --> 03:26:42.820]  He went to the hospital, they inserted a catheter, this last week.
[03:26:42.820 --> 03:26:44.980]  The doctor told him to pull it out the next day.
[03:26:44.980 --> 03:26:45.980]  He did.
[03:26:45.980 --> 03:26:46.980]  It didn't go well.
[03:26:46.980 --> 03:26:48.820]  He went back to the hospital.
[03:26:48.820 --> 03:26:53.780]  They had to put it back in.
[03:26:53.780 --> 03:26:57.940]  You know what the two visits cost him?
[03:26:57.940 --> 03:27:03.460]  $13,000.
[03:27:03.460 --> 03:27:13.460]  This is a guy that he has a name for the Democrats that's not very favorable.
[03:27:13.460 --> 03:27:16.260]  He can't stand them.
[03:27:16.260 --> 03:27:22.740]  He's a Trump supporter, but he said, what am I going to do about healthcare?
[03:27:22.740 --> 03:27:25.980]  That's going to be the major issue.
[03:27:25.980 --> 03:27:35.420]  I talked to relatively strong middle-class people that pay $30,000 a year for medical
[03:27:35.420 --> 03:27:36.420]  coverage.
[03:27:36.420 --> 03:27:39.300]  That's a real burden on them.
[03:27:39.300 --> 03:27:48.460]  That's going to be the big negative that could sway the election because even in the
[03:27:48.460 --> 03:27:53.180]  swing states, they want to swing for free.
[03:27:53.180 --> 03:27:57.700]  The medical issues are going to be a big one.
[03:27:57.700 --> 03:28:07.300]  But other than that, our forecast, and you're hearing it on Alex Jones' show, is as things
[03:28:07.300 --> 03:28:15.420]  stand now, given the cast of characters that's in the presidential reality show, it's Trump
[03:28:15.420 --> 03:28:19.940]  2020.
[03:28:19.940 --> 03:28:25.060]  Because they're just going to keep pumping up their favorites, and their favorites like
[03:28:25.060 --> 03:28:33.300]  the Beto O'Rourke and that Mayer from South Bend, Indiana, they're not going to cut it
[03:28:33.300 --> 03:28:35.820]  and either will burn it.
[03:28:35.820 --> 03:28:44.220]  Because even the Democrats want jobs, so we're going to be back in a few and tell you what's
[03:28:44.220 --> 03:28:53.500]  going to happen next.
[03:28:53.500 --> 03:28:57.220]  Pain in my neck, back, and shoulders has really gotten worse.
[03:28:57.220 --> 03:29:00.220]  Relief for body pain is here with Sunny Bay heating pads.
[03:29:00.220 --> 03:29:03.980]  Well, the last thing I want is to take another pill, so what's so good about Sunny Bay heating
[03:29:03.980 --> 03:29:04.980]  pads?
[03:29:04.980 --> 03:29:10.420]  Sunny Bay heating pads made by Biomed DB Design right here in the USA come in all sizes.
[03:29:10.420 --> 03:29:15.180]  Our extra-large, microwaveable heating pad for back pain is designed to be large enough
[03:29:15.180 --> 03:29:17.100]  to cover your entire back.
[03:29:17.100 --> 03:29:20.660]  It's also perfect to wrap around your legs, knees, or shoulder and neck.
[03:29:20.660 --> 03:29:22.420]  But I need to know their good quality.
[03:29:22.420 --> 03:29:27.140]  Of course, Sunny Bay heating pads and pillows are often an Amazon choice, and it's easy
[03:29:27.140 --> 03:29:31.380]  and most affordable when you purchase your Sunny Bay heating pads right from our website,

[03:29:39.660 --> 03:29:40.660]  gift, right?

[03:29:48.780 --> 03:29:54.500]  or shop for your Sunny Bay heating pad at SunshinePillows.com.
[03:29:54.500 --> 03:29:58.060]  Our grandparents, the great grandparents, knew that they canned food during the fall,
[03:29:58.060 --> 03:29:59.620]  so they'd have it during the winter.
[03:29:59.620 --> 03:30:03.540]  And that's what I'm talking about at M4Store.com.
[03:30:03.540 --> 03:30:09.620]  With M4 Select, it's the full spectrum of my Patriots supply, one of the top most respected
[03:30:09.620 --> 03:30:15.700]  companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts
[03:30:15.700 --> 03:30:18.300]  that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[03:30:18.300 --> 03:30:22.580]  But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have storeable food so it's a total
[03:30:22.580 --> 03:30:23.580]  win-win.
[03:30:23.580 --> 03:30:29.340]  We have those incredible sell prices back at M4Store.com on M4 Select storeable foods
[03:30:29.340 --> 03:30:33.620]  They've got special diet foods, they've got three-month supplies, your supplies, weak
[03:30:33.620 --> 03:30:37.660]  emergency supplies, they've got so many great products there, and you've got a three-year
[03:30:37.660 --> 03:30:38.660]  supply.
[03:30:38.660 --> 03:30:40.620]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[03:30:40.620 --> 03:30:43.180]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[03:30:43.180 --> 03:30:48.140]  You're buying war bonds, bringing great products, and together, with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[03:30:48.140 --> 03:30:54.060]  M4Store.com and M4 Select, high-quality storeable foods, powered by my Patriots supply.
[03:30:54.060 --> 03:30:58.460]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[03:30:58.460 --> 03:31:03.180]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[03:31:03.180 --> 03:31:04.700]  to detoxify the body.
[03:31:04.700 --> 03:31:09.580]  That's why I'm introducing ZShield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[03:31:09.580 --> 03:31:11.100]  It's made in the USA.
[03:31:11.100 --> 03:31:16.020]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[03:31:16.020 --> 03:31:17.860]  the body, and it supports the M4.
[03:31:17.860 --> 03:31:20.100]  It is a classical 360-win.
[03:31:20.100 --> 03:31:24.580]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe
[03:31:24.580 --> 03:31:29.260]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[03:31:29.260 --> 03:31:30.260]  get.
[03:31:30.260 --> 03:31:33.460]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this
[03:31:33.460 --> 03:31:38.500]  country and the world that Patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you
[03:31:38.500 --> 03:31:43.700]  can be, because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the
[03:31:43.700 --> 03:31:46.460]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[03:31:46.460 --> 03:31:49.740]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[03:31:49.740 --> 03:31:53.900]  Now it's time to change our bodies with ZShield and M4Store.com.
[03:31:53.900 --> 03:31:57.940]  InfowarsStore.com is how you support us, and it's not like we're selling stuff you don't
[03:31:57.940 --> 03:31:59.060]  need, you don't want.
[03:31:59.060 --> 03:32:05.980]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major
[03:32:05.980 --> 03:32:06.980]  city.
[03:32:06.980 --> 03:32:10.620]  There's some of the most polluted areas on earth, our major cities.
[03:32:10.620 --> 03:32:12.380]  How can I solve that problem?
[03:32:12.380 --> 03:32:19.540]  So we have air filters at InfowarsStore.com, the Elexapure Breeze, which is right now $50
[03:32:19.540 --> 03:32:26.380]  off the Elexapure Breeze Groundbreaking Iron Cluster Air Filter Technology, and we've got
[03:32:26.380 --> 03:32:29.020]  a limited quantity of these left right now.
[03:32:29.020 --> 03:32:32.940]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[03:32:32.940 --> 03:32:36.780]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[03:32:36.780 --> 03:32:38.780]  I've got two in my home.
[03:32:38.780 --> 03:32:43.940]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Elexapure Breeze in your
[03:32:43.940 --> 03:32:49.580]  house, don't live in a polluted major city in your home.
[03:32:49.580 --> 03:32:50.580]  Have clean air.
[03:32:50.580 --> 03:32:56.940]  Go to InfowarsStore.com.
[03:32:56.940 --> 03:33:16.900]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:16.900 --> 03:33:22.580]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:33:22.580 --> 03:33:29.100]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show with Gerald Salente.
[03:33:29.100 --> 03:33:41.500]  Yes, yes, yes, 1776, free, dumb, and to help keep freedom ringing, you have to support
[03:33:41.500 --> 03:33:46.580]  the people that are making it happen, such as, you don't have to, of course.
[03:33:46.580 --> 03:33:51.260]  You don't have to if you don't want to, if you want to just keep listening to the prostitutes
[03:33:51.260 --> 03:33:59.700]  and the stupid garbage they put on, tune into ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, or any other one that's
[03:33:59.700 --> 03:34:02.420]  controlled by the corporate media.
[03:34:02.420 --> 03:34:07.500]  If you want to hear freedom ring, you have to support the people that are doing it because
[03:34:07.500 --> 03:34:14.420]  it can't happen, whether it's our Trends Journal that people are subscribing to or Infowars.
[03:34:14.420 --> 03:34:18.700]  You have to put your money where your heart and mind are, and I suggest you start putting
[03:34:18.700 --> 03:34:28.140]  your money on Infowars, Life Select, Survival Food, powered by Patriot Supply, Two Weeks
[03:34:28.140 --> 03:34:31.500]  Survival Food, Plan Special.
[03:34:31.500 --> 03:34:37.140]  Now when you say survival food, I mean it, because when things go down, you know what
[03:34:37.140 --> 03:34:44.980]  I say, guns, gold, and a getaway plan, and you better have survival food along with that.
[03:34:44.980 --> 03:34:48.820]  Because when this thing unfolds, it's going to go down big.
[03:34:48.820 --> 03:34:55.340]  We have a $250 trillion debt bubble that's probably more like $280 trillion by now, waiting
[03:34:55.340 --> 03:34:57.900]  for the new numbers to come out.
[03:34:57.900 --> 03:35:03.020]  When things crash and things go under, you're going to want to have and need what it takes
[03:35:03.020 --> 03:35:09.340]  to survive, and they've just managed to get an incredible deal for anyone looking to take
[03:35:09.340 --> 03:35:16.580]  care of their family in an emergency, and an emergency can happen again at any time,
[03:35:16.580 --> 03:35:18.500]  any place, anywhere.
[03:35:18.500 --> 03:35:23.980]  There are a lot of wildcards out there ready to be played, and they're giving you a special
[03:35:23.980 --> 03:35:32.500]  offer to let you help anyone looking to provide food security in an emergency for their family
[03:35:32.500 --> 03:35:39.740]  with the two-week food supply, you ready, for just $67.
[03:35:39.740 --> 03:35:40.740]  That's it.
[03:35:40.740 --> 03:35:47.060]  That's over 50% off their convenient, nutritious, and easy to store emergency food supplies
[03:35:47.060 --> 03:35:52.100]  to help you prepare your family.
[03:35:52.100 --> 03:35:59.580]  Because the folks at InfoWare want to make sure everyone can be ready for a time of need.
[03:35:59.580 --> 03:36:07.740]  So please, because they're doing this to help everyone, please limit to just four purchases
[03:36:07.740 --> 03:36:13.020]  for your family, and that's less than $5 a day.
[03:36:13.020 --> 03:36:19.420]  Again, when this thing goes down, it's going to go down hard, and it's going to happen
[03:36:19.420 --> 03:36:20.420]  globally.
[03:36:20.420 --> 03:36:21.900]  I'm a trend forecaster.
[03:36:21.900 --> 03:36:27.260]  I talk about all these different issues because all things are connected, or as Chief Seattle
[03:36:27.260 --> 03:36:33.460]  once said, allegedly, all things are connected like the blood which unites us all, and the
[03:36:33.460 --> 03:36:36.500]  blood is spilling.
[03:36:36.500 --> 03:36:38.780]  Take a trip over there to Sudan.
[03:36:38.780 --> 03:36:42.420]  Oh, yeah, a lot of blood's been spilling over there.
[03:36:42.420 --> 03:36:48.140]  They got a revolution going on.
[03:36:48.140 --> 03:36:52.620]  Sudanese stay in streets insisting on civilian leaders.
[03:36:52.620 --> 03:37:01.180]  The Sudanese, over the last month or so, have been taken to the streets daily, thousands
[03:37:01.180 --> 03:37:02.860]  of people being killed.
[03:37:02.860 --> 03:37:08.500]  They're fighting back against a regime that's been in power for over 30 years, and they're
[03:37:08.500 --> 03:37:09.500]  not alone.
[03:37:09.500 --> 03:37:12.900]  Hey, take a trip down to Algeria.
[03:37:12.900 --> 03:37:16.860]  Yep, same thing going over there.
[03:37:16.860 --> 03:37:23.620]  They had two strokes, they had a cat that's been running the show since 1999.
[03:37:23.620 --> 03:37:28.540]  1999, that was almost a youth back then.
[03:37:28.540 --> 03:37:38.300]  Anyway, the guy had two strokes, hadn't spoken to the people in six years, and they say he
[03:37:38.300 --> 03:37:40.260]  was still running the show.
[03:37:40.260 --> 03:37:47.980]  The people took to the streets day after day, week after week, month after month.
[03:37:47.980 --> 03:37:54.380]  They brought down the guy, and now they're going to have elections on July 4th.
[03:37:54.380 --> 03:38:01.340]  Excuse me, in July, not July 4th, maybe July 5th.
[03:38:01.340 --> 03:38:03.980]  The people made it happen.
[03:38:03.980 --> 03:38:09.980]  Going back to the emergency foods, there's disruption all over the world.
[03:38:09.980 --> 03:38:12.500]  How about this one?
[03:38:12.500 --> 03:38:17.740]  UN says scores killed in Tripoli clash.
[03:38:17.740 --> 03:38:25.180]  Oh, yeah, from the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli, the richest country in
[03:38:25.180 --> 03:38:33.740]  Africa, until the Nobel Peace of Craft Prize winner Barack Obama, Samantha Power, and Susan
[03:38:33.740 --> 03:38:40.380]  Rice, and let's not forget, Hillary Clinton, decided Gaddafi has to go.
[03:38:40.380 --> 03:38:50.100]  The richest country in Libya with one of the richest oil reserves in the world, the cheapest
[03:38:50.100 --> 03:38:58.460]  to pull out just among, less than a dollar a barrel, and the sweetest to sweet crude.
[03:38:58.460 --> 03:39:10.900]  Now the place is wrapped in civil war, migrants escaping Africa, slavery in Libya as the people
[03:39:10.900 --> 03:39:21.460]  of fighting to stay alive, on a war brought to you by the Obama, Hillary Clinton, Samantha
[03:39:21.460 --> 03:39:26.540]  Power, Susan Rice, if only the women were in charge.
[03:39:26.540 --> 03:39:33.420]  As you know what I say, men, women, black, white, race, creed of color, good and bad
[03:39:33.420 --> 03:39:35.780]  comes in all of them.
[03:39:35.780 --> 03:39:38.460]  So I don't like playing those games.
[03:39:38.460 --> 03:39:48.540]  I call a spade a spade, going back to your food supply.
[03:39:48.540 --> 03:39:51.220]  This war in Libya is a big one.
[03:39:51.220 --> 03:39:58.180]  The war in Yemen still keeps going, non-stop.
[03:39:58.180 --> 03:40:06.580]  And guess what, the prostitutes, hardly a peep.
[03:40:06.580 --> 03:40:13.220]  This is from fairness and accuracy in reporting.
[03:40:13.220 --> 03:40:19.780]  The nominally liberal media powerhouse MSNBC was once again AWOL.
[03:40:19.780 --> 03:40:29.060]  The 24-hour cable news channel is yet to cover the Yemen war in all of 2019, repeating a
[03:40:29.060 --> 03:40:36.620]  similar no-show record when activists were attempting to end the war last spring.
[03:40:36.620 --> 03:40:47.380]  NBC ignored Yemen entirely from September 2016 through July 2018.
[03:40:47.380 --> 03:40:55.980]  And the only reason they brought it up with that guy, Kasagi, was murdered by the Saudis
[03:40:55.980 --> 03:41:05.020]  allegedly in Turkey, and he was a reporter.
[03:41:05.020 --> 03:41:10.420]  Here we go, Chris Hayes finally reported a U.S.-made bomb that killed over 40 children
[03:41:10.420 --> 03:41:19.340]  in Yemen's school bus, and that was in August 2018.
[03:41:19.340 --> 03:41:31.980]  And Fair pointed out that MSNBC had 455 mentions, you ready, of Stormy Daniels and Zero of
[03:41:31.980 --> 03:41:40.620]  Yemen from July 2017 to July 2018.
[03:41:40.620 --> 03:41:47.660]  And this is why you have to support, whether it's the Trends Journal, Info Wars, or others
[03:41:47.660 --> 03:41:52.020]  that you believe are doing our best to put out the truth.
[03:41:52.020 --> 03:42:04.260]  And let freedom ring and end that cycle to make it again a nation that has integrity
[03:42:04.260 --> 03:42:13.500]  and ethics, and end this disgusting, prostitute media that just keeps selling hate.
[03:42:13.500 --> 03:42:19.780]  Again, if you want to hate Trump, tune into the mainstream media.
[03:42:19.780 --> 03:42:25.420]  They haven't stopped since Election Day 2016.
[03:42:25.420 --> 03:42:31.780]  And again, I'm not pumping Trump, everybody that knows me knows I call it the way it is.
[03:42:31.780 --> 03:42:35.620]  But this is a waste of time and a waste of energy.
[03:42:35.620 --> 03:42:42.180]  Let's put our energy and our vitality into producing things that are going to make this
[03:42:42.180 --> 03:42:53.380]  nation a better nation for us all, be back in a few minutes.
[03:42:53.380 --> 03:42:57.500]  The globalist, the eugenicist are always talking down to us.
[03:42:57.500 --> 03:43:02.260]  They're always trying to make us feel small, to feel insignificant.
[03:43:02.260 --> 03:43:06.580]  They try to censor, because they fear you and don't want you to have the right to access
[03:43:06.580 --> 03:43:10.180]  information so you can make your own decisions.
[03:43:10.180 --> 03:43:12.460]  They want you to believe you're powerless.
[03:43:12.460 --> 03:43:18.660]  But the truth is, it is we the people, and our ideas, and our actions, and what we say
[03:43:18.660 --> 03:43:23.300]  and what we do that changes the world, we are the power structure.
[03:43:23.300 --> 03:43:24.900]  We are the inventors.
[03:43:24.900 --> 03:43:25.900]  We are the trailblazers.
[03:43:25.900 --> 03:43:30.100]  And the globalists understand that.
[03:43:30.100 --> 03:43:35.380]  And they understand that they are basically trying to control and steal the future from
[03:43:35.380 --> 03:43:36.380]  we the people.
[03:43:36.380 --> 03:43:41.940]  Now, to help fund our operation, it's undoubtedly the very tip of the spear against these globalists.
[03:43:41.940 --> 03:43:46.180]  I want to encourage listeners and viewers to understand that throughout the second half
[03:43:46.180 --> 03:43:51.220]  of the month of March, we're going to have store-wide free shipping at 50% off at infostore.com,

[03:43:53.460 --> 03:43:57.740]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[03:43:57.740 --> 03:44:01.740]  Info Wars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with
[03:44:01.740 --> 03:44:04.740]  every faucet, shower, and sink in your home.
[03:44:04.740 --> 03:44:08.460]  That's why we're bringing you something to provide clean water for your whole house with

[03:44:54.500 --> 03:44:56.580]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[03:44:56.580 --> 03:44:57.580]  Go ahead.
[03:44:57.580 --> 03:44:59.540]  Yeah, I just have to say something, man.
[03:44:59.540 --> 03:45:03.260]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[03:45:03.260 --> 03:45:04.260]  It just gets old, man.
[03:45:04.260 --> 03:45:07.220]  I'm going to shut you down right now, okay?
[03:45:07.220 --> 03:45:09.460]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[03:45:09.460 --> 03:45:13.660]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[03:45:13.660 --> 03:45:16.100]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[03:45:16.100 --> 03:45:19.340]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[03:45:19.340 --> 03:45:21.900]  I mean, what's it going to take us being shut down?
[03:45:21.900 --> 03:45:22.900]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[03:45:22.900 --> 03:45:23.900]  Yeah, you know what, Alex?
[03:45:23.900 --> 03:45:24.900]  Hey, put it on pause again.
[03:45:24.900 --> 03:45:25.900]  Hey, Frank!
[03:45:25.900 --> 03:45:30.420]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say we are the tip of the spear?
[03:45:30.420 --> 03:45:31.420]  We're under attack.
[03:45:31.420 --> 03:45:32.420]  We need your help.
[03:45:32.420 --> 03:45:36.740]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[03:45:36.740 --> 03:45:39.660]  I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[03:45:39.660 --> 03:45:40.660]  Do you understand?
[03:45:40.660 --> 03:45:41.980]  I need your help, Frank.
[03:45:41.980 --> 03:45:44.220]  I need your help, Frank.
[03:45:44.220 --> 03:45:49.380]  Go to infowarstore.com right now and help fund the info war.
[03:45:49.380 --> 03:45:50.540]  Do you understand?
[03:45:50.540 --> 03:45:52.220]  I need your help, Frank.
[03:45:52.220 --> 03:46:03.660]  Every press needs your help, Frank.
[03:46:03.660 --> 03:46:10.780]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks
[03:46:10.780 --> 03:46:16.900]  and energy supplements, but they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeine
[03:46:16.900 --> 03:46:21.380]  and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in just a few hours and
[03:46:21.380 --> 03:46:22.740]  have terrible side effects.
[03:46:22.740 --> 03:46:29.340]  We have developed, hands down, from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout
[03:46:29.340 --> 03:46:32.180]  and beyond system in the world.
[03:46:32.180 --> 03:46:33.700]  There's nothing else like it.
[03:46:33.700 --> 03:46:34.700]  Must experience it.
[03:46:34.700 --> 03:46:39.180]  It is a total game changer and it comes in easy to use, packaged, mixed in with fruit
[03:46:39.180 --> 03:46:41.580]  juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[03:46:41.580 --> 03:46:42.580]  Warning, though.
[03:46:42.580 --> 03:46:43.580]  It's very, very strong.
[03:46:43.580 --> 03:46:44.580]  It lasts up to 10 hours.
[03:46:44.580 --> 03:46:48.740]  So take a half packet the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce
[03:46:48.740 --> 03:46:50.860]  because it will take you into overdrive.
[03:46:50.860 --> 03:46:58.020]  TurboForce and M4sLive.com.
[03:46:58.020 --> 03:47:16.140]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:16.140 --> 03:47:23.140]  And now, your host, Gerald Salente.
[03:47:23.140 --> 03:47:30.380]  Hey, thanks for having me on in Bow Wars and hosting the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:30.380 --> 03:47:31.940]  Hey, that's my kind of music.
[03:47:31.940 --> 03:47:34.180]  I'm that big band kind of guy.
[03:47:34.180 --> 03:47:39.140]  They also like music that not a lot of people know about.
[03:47:39.140 --> 03:47:40.140]  Call it race music.
[03:47:40.140 --> 03:47:43.140]  It happened after World War II.
[03:47:43.140 --> 03:47:47.340]  And what happened was, they call it race music because it was only played on the black radio
[03:47:47.340 --> 03:47:48.340]  stations.
[03:47:48.340 --> 03:47:50.340]  They had black and white radio stations back then.
[03:47:50.340 --> 03:47:55.580]  So what happened was they couldn't afford to put 18 cats on the road anymore after World
[03:47:55.580 --> 03:47:58.100]  War II because inflation skyrocketed.
[03:47:58.100 --> 03:48:04.220]  Remember, the big bands start during the Great Depression.
[03:48:04.220 --> 03:48:10.300]  Grab your coat, shake your hat, leave your worries by the doorstep.
[03:48:10.300 --> 03:48:14.660]  Life could be so sweet on the sunny side of the street.
[03:48:14.660 --> 03:48:15.660]  And that's what they did.
[03:48:15.660 --> 03:48:24.980]  They had that music to lift people up rather than, wasn't that man, it was a lift up time.
[03:48:24.980 --> 03:48:28.260]  So the big bands really would be.
[03:48:28.260 --> 03:48:30.900]  And they used to travel all around the country.
[03:48:30.900 --> 03:48:31.900]  So there's a depression.
[03:48:31.900 --> 03:48:33.780]  Nobody's making any dub.
[03:48:33.780 --> 03:48:38.420]  And then when World War II started, they had price controls, can't raise the price on anything.
[03:48:38.420 --> 03:48:44.460]  So you could still afford to put 18 guys on the road.
[03:48:44.460 --> 03:48:50.060]  But then when World War II ended, they lifted price controls and inflation went foop.
[03:48:50.060 --> 03:48:52.260]  So they couldn't put 18 people on the road.
[03:48:52.260 --> 03:48:54.420]  So they had what they call breaking down the bands.
[03:48:54.420 --> 03:48:58.620]  It was a beginning of rock and roll.
[03:48:58.620 --> 03:49:01.500]  Instead of that swing, they shortened it up.
[03:49:01.500 --> 03:49:03.900]  It's the hardest stuff.
[03:49:03.900 --> 03:49:06.420]  It's the hardest stuff.
[03:49:06.420 --> 03:49:09.700]  People like Red Price sock, Smiley Lewis.
[03:49:09.700 --> 03:49:15.540]  Anyways, when I hear that big band stuff, that's the kind of stuff I like into the beginning
[03:49:15.540 --> 03:49:16.540]  of rock and roll.
[03:49:16.540 --> 03:49:20.420]  And again, they called it breaking down the bands.
[03:49:20.420 --> 03:49:25.380]  And they called it race music because they only played it on the black radio stations.
[03:49:25.380 --> 03:49:27.420]  So I had all, I was the youngest of five.
[03:49:27.420 --> 03:49:31.580]  So I had all older brothers and sisters, and they weren't listening to any of that.
[03:49:31.580 --> 03:49:38.260]  They were listening to the stuff on the white radio stations like, you know, how much is
[03:49:38.260 --> 03:49:39.260]  that door?
[03:49:39.260 --> 03:49:42.100]  Gee, in the window, woof, woof.
[03:49:42.100 --> 03:49:47.020]  So that's the music I like, that hot stuff.
[03:49:47.020 --> 03:49:49.020]  Jump.
[03:49:49.020 --> 03:49:50.020]  Boom.
[03:49:50.020 --> 03:49:51.020]  Anyway, moving on.
[03:49:51.020 --> 03:49:53.740]  I was talking about what's going on in Libya.
[03:49:53.740 --> 03:50:03.820]  UN says, scores killed in triply clash, why isn't there any outrage that this war was
[03:50:03.820 --> 03:50:12.140]  brought by Cameron of the UK, Obama, and Sarkozy of France with the backing, as I said, of
[03:50:12.140 --> 03:50:16.140]  Hillary Clinton, Samantha Power, and Susan Rice, with the New York Times, the toilet
[03:50:16.140 --> 03:50:21.980]  paper record, had written extensively about them being behind it the most.
[03:50:21.980 --> 03:50:27.140]  This destructive war that's destroyed this wonderful country that compared to all the
[03:50:27.140 --> 03:50:31.820]  countries in the area, they were the best by far.
[03:50:31.820 --> 03:50:39.300]  So I'm talking about this because it all ties together, gold prices, oil, oil prices.
[03:50:39.300 --> 03:50:45.140]  Oil prices are now set to hit $3 a gallon in the United States.
[03:50:45.140 --> 03:50:49.300]  You got Brent Crude above $70 a barrel.
[03:50:49.300 --> 03:50:52.740]  It's the beginning of the driving season.
[03:50:52.740 --> 03:50:58.180]  They're not pumping any oil at a triple, hardly any oil coming out of Libya now.
[03:50:58.180 --> 03:51:04.180]  The sanctions on Venezuela, the country with the richest oil reserves in the world, woof,
[03:51:04.180 --> 03:51:10.260]  hardly putting out anything because of the sanctions, oil prices are going up.
[03:51:10.260 --> 03:51:18.060]  The more money you put in your gas tank, the less goes into cash registers, whether it's
[03:51:18.060 --> 03:51:25.020]  in restaurants, retail, hospitality, you name it.
[03:51:25.020 --> 03:51:28.220]  So putting this together, and that's why I talk about global and talk about these different
[03:51:28.220 --> 03:51:33.900]  issues, what's going on in Africa, Algeria is another big oil supplier.
[03:51:33.900 --> 03:51:45.300]  If oil prices go to $85 to $100 a barrel, kiss the economy and the equity markets, bye
[03:51:45.300 --> 03:51:46.300]  bye.
[03:51:46.300 --> 03:51:49.500]  We're going to go now.
[03:51:49.500 --> 03:51:51.360]  That's what's going to happen.
[03:51:51.360 --> 03:51:53.860]  We need peace.
[03:51:53.860 --> 03:51:58.900]  And I say that not as an empty phrase.
[03:51:58.900 --> 03:52:10.780]  I say that also because in today's paper, the New York Times, suicides among veterans
[03:52:10.780 --> 03:52:14.460]  show no sign of slowing.
[03:52:14.460 --> 03:52:25.100]  Mr. Trump's executive order was a tacit acknowledgement of what the debts rendered obvious.
[03:52:25.100 --> 03:52:36.620]  The department has not made a dent in stemming the approximately 20 suicide deaths every day
[03:52:36.620 --> 03:52:40.140]  among veterans.
[03:52:40.140 --> 03:52:43.260]  This is terrible.
[03:52:43.260 --> 03:52:46.380]  We have to end these wards.
[03:52:46.380 --> 03:52:52.100]  When I was a young guy, I was prime draft meat for the Vietnam War.
[03:52:52.100 --> 03:52:54.420]  I'm Trump's age.
[03:52:54.420 --> 03:52:57.180]  He got out on a bone spur.
[03:52:57.180 --> 03:53:01.820]  I found my ways of getting out, and I was too stupid to be against the war based on
[03:53:01.820 --> 03:53:02.820]  lines.
[03:53:02.820 --> 03:53:05.100]  I was a kid.
[03:53:05.100 --> 03:53:11.300]  As a matter of fact, I liked those war things that they were showing, you know, looks tough.
[03:53:11.300 --> 03:53:16.780]  But I couldn't imagine me walking in water this high, with a lot of weight on my back
[03:53:16.780 --> 03:53:19.980]  and carrying a gun over my head and getting shot at.
[03:53:19.980 --> 03:53:21.820]  So I did.
[03:53:21.820 --> 03:53:22.940]  I went to college.
[03:53:22.940 --> 03:53:24.740]  I barely got out of high school.
[03:53:24.740 --> 03:53:26.740]  I got out of high school with a 70 average.
[03:53:26.740 --> 03:53:34.660]  I ended up going to school in Charleston, West Virginia, you know, a Pozzano from the Bronx
[03:53:34.660 --> 03:53:38.020]  and Yonkers ending up down there, right?
[03:53:38.020 --> 03:53:40.780]  That's how much I wanted not to go to war.
[03:53:40.780 --> 03:53:41.780]  And it was great.
[03:53:41.780 --> 03:53:43.780]  The people in West Virginia were very kind.
[03:53:43.780 --> 03:53:49.740]  But anyway, going back to this and putting it all together, you only had one Tory duty
[03:53:49.740 --> 03:53:54.860]  back then, and then didn't you figure out?
[03:53:54.860 --> 03:53:59.500]  And now these poor men and women are going back and forth, back and forth, back and forth
[03:53:59.500 --> 03:54:01.500]  into losing wars.
[03:54:01.500 --> 03:54:07.540]  Going on 18 years in Afghanistan, a war we never should have been in.
[03:54:07.540 --> 03:54:11.140]  We're going to get that Osama bin Laden and bring them back.
[03:54:11.140 --> 03:54:16.060]  Yeah, that's the BS they gave you wrote about this in detail.
[03:54:16.060 --> 03:54:18.420]  The Iraq war based on lies.
[03:54:18.420 --> 03:54:21.260]  Look what they're doing to the people that are going there.
[03:54:21.260 --> 03:54:23.500]  It's not the senator's sons.
[03:54:23.500 --> 03:54:25.260]  It's not the rich kids.
[03:54:25.260 --> 03:54:32.500]  No, the rich kids, daddies and mommies are paying hundreds and thousands of dollars.
[03:54:32.500 --> 03:54:43.220]  So baby cakes and baby boy, get into having Princeton or Yale.
[03:54:43.220 --> 03:54:51.220]  As the poorer people are looking for a future and hoping to find it in the service.
[03:54:51.220 --> 03:54:55.380]  I say, yeah, join the service.
[03:54:55.380 --> 03:54:58.460]  Close all the bases overseas.
[03:54:58.460 --> 03:55:03.980]  What are you doing with a base in Italy and in Germany?
[03:55:03.980 --> 03:55:09.260]  It's only helping the military industrial complex and all these other countries.
[03:55:09.260 --> 03:55:17.260]  Bring them all secure the homeland with the troops and put them to work rebuilding our
[03:55:17.260 --> 03:55:26.620]  rotted third world infrastructure potholes everywhere in a city and state near you.
[03:55:26.620 --> 03:55:29.380]  A rail system that's third world.
[03:55:29.380 --> 03:55:31.340]  You take the subway in New York.
[03:55:31.340 --> 03:55:34.660]  It's a night in Calcutta.
[03:55:34.660 --> 03:55:41.780]  Put the troops to work rebuilding our infrastructure, a troops progress administration.
[03:55:41.780 --> 03:55:48.460]  Now they're going into the military and they're coming out with usable skills rather than
[03:55:48.460 --> 03:55:54.260]  playing these moronic war games.
[03:55:54.260 --> 03:56:01.140]  Join the service, but give them, give them something that they can use when they get
[03:56:01.140 --> 03:56:08.820]  out that will benefit us all to rebuild our rotted third world infrastructure.
[03:56:08.820 --> 03:56:11.860]  This story is heart wrenching.
[03:56:11.860 --> 03:56:17.340]  You won't read it again and it won't be on the cartoon news network.
[03:56:17.340 --> 03:56:33.220]  It won't be a feature on MSNBC, more stupid news MSNBC, more stupid news brought to you
[03:56:33.220 --> 03:56:43.220]  by arrogant people with big attitudes like all of them, 20 suicide deaths every day
[03:56:43.220 --> 03:56:45.780]  among veterans.
[03:56:45.780 --> 03:56:49.620]  So please do what you can to occupy peace.
[03:56:49.620 --> 03:56:52.380]  Occupypeace.com is our website.
[03:56:52.380 --> 03:56:58.700]  We're doing all we can to bring peace back to America because when we have more peace,
[03:56:58.700 --> 03:57:01.740]  it will be more prosperity for everyone.
[03:57:01.740 --> 03:57:03.100]  The troops can close the border.
[03:57:03.100 --> 03:57:05.340]  We won't even need a border wall.
[03:57:05.340 --> 03:57:06.780]  That's right.
[03:57:06.780 --> 03:57:14.100]  And we put them together work getting skills, talent and passion because they're really
[03:57:14.100 --> 03:57:18.220]  doing something to help this country.
[03:57:18.220 --> 03:57:19.940]  This infrastructure stinks.
[03:57:19.940 --> 03:57:21.820]  It's a joke.
[03:57:21.820 --> 03:57:26.140]  Look what the Chinese are doing.
[03:57:26.140 --> 03:57:31.940]  So that's what I have to say for now and I have more to say when I'm back and remember
[03:57:31.940 --> 03:57:34.220]  do all you can to support Infowars.
[03:57:34.220 --> 03:57:36.220]  See you next time.
[03:57:36.220 --> 03:57:48.460]  There are thousands of ideologies out there, hundreds of different political systems and
[03:57:48.460 --> 03:57:51.540]  most of them are funded by the globalist.
[03:57:51.540 --> 03:57:53.940]  Infowars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[03:57:53.940 --> 03:57:57.580]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[03:57:57.580 --> 03:57:59.220]  I didn't invent all this.
[03:57:59.220 --> 03:58:04.100]  I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana and what really works for humanity and I'm
[03:58:04.100 --> 03:58:09.860]  simply trying to bring it back and it's super popular like it's always been.
[03:58:09.860 --> 03:58:13.860]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately because we have the
[03:58:13.860 --> 03:58:17.740]  light in the dark of the night that sends chills at my spine.
[03:58:17.740 --> 03:58:22.260]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and Infowars by buying the great products
[03:58:22.260 --> 03:58:26.700]  at infowarsstore.com, by spreading the articles, by spreading the videos and by praying for
[03:58:26.700 --> 03:58:31.260]  this operation and for praying for this nation and the world for peace and discernment.
[03:58:31.260 --> 03:58:35.220]  For myself and the whole Infowars family, I want to thank all of you for what you've
[03:58:35.220 --> 03:58:39.140]  done because without you, Infowars is nothing.
[03:58:39.140 --> 03:58:45.300]  You are the Infowars and I salute you.
[03:58:45.300 --> 03:58:46.780]  I want to say Brain Force is great.
[03:58:46.780 --> 03:58:48.780]  I want to say Turbo Force is amazing.
[03:58:48.780 --> 03:58:49.780]  It is.
[03:58:49.780 --> 03:58:54.220]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[03:58:54.220 --> 03:58:57.460]  The fish oil is better than it and that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[03:58:57.460 --> 03:59:03.020]  The fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[03:59:03.020 --> 03:59:06.220]  You've got the children's, you've got the adults, you've got the krill oil.
[03:59:06.220 --> 03:59:09.860]  If you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are really strong.
[03:59:09.860 --> 03:59:13.220]  They don't give you the burpees, but krill oil is the best and it'll give you the damn
[03:59:13.220 --> 03:59:16.580]  burps and I'm sorry, you want something like this, you don't get stuff for free.
[03:59:16.580 --> 03:59:19.660]  The krill is hallucinogenic, it's so good in my view.
[03:59:19.660 --> 03:59:22.560]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something, I eat five
[03:59:22.560 --> 03:59:28.180]  capillots of krill oil before I go to bed, I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[03:59:28.180 --> 03:59:35.660]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[03:59:35.660 --> 03:59:39.100]  So we don't make a big profit off of it, but you know what, I just obsess because whatever
[03:59:39.100 --> 03:59:47.420]  the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you, I just can't do it.
[03:59:47.420 --> 03:59:53.180]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
