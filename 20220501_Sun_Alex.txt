[00:00.000 --> 00:09.840]  Well, as the Democrat Party in the liberal media and Hollywood and all their control
[00:09.840 --> 00:16.900]  freaks want you to be concerned about who controls the Internet, it's all about censorship
[00:16.900 --> 00:17.900]  for them.
[00:17.900 --> 00:19.680]  What about who controls the food supply?
[00:19.680 --> 00:22.880]  You can't eat the Internet if you're hungry.
[00:22.880 --> 00:24.120]  Who controls the food supply?
[00:24.120 --> 00:33.600]  Here's the latest from Gregory's.
[00:33.600 --> 00:40.320]  During the 1990s, Monsanto Corporation's devastating attack against farmers, their genetically
[00:40.320 --> 00:47.000]  modified franken foods, and their neurotoxic pesticides inspired people to push government
[00:47.000 --> 00:50.840]  into legislating certification standards for foods.
[00:50.840 --> 00:56.720]  But thanks to big pharma, Bill Gates, and pop culture media brainwashing, Monsanto still
[00:56.720 --> 01:02.880]  stands strong and is ready to take complete control of your food supply, with the help
[01:02.880 --> 01:09.600]  of the same powerful families and foundations who already control the money and the energy.
[01:09.600 --> 01:14.640]  Their plans to do so are comprehensively laid out in a recent report published at Corey
[01:14.640 --> 01:20.720]  Diggs, the indoor vertical farming industry, which is a highly innovative and efficient
[01:20.720 --> 01:27.000]  method, is being funded by Bill Gates and pushed by the World Economic Forum as a replacement
[01:27.000 --> 01:30.040]  to conventional outdoor farming.
[01:30.040 --> 01:35.320]  Arrow Farms is the industry leader in vertical farming, and they also co-developed the first
[01:35.320 --> 01:42.440]  CRISPR gene-edited produce product, and worked with the NIH to produce proteins for the deadly
[01:42.440 --> 01:48.400]  COVID vaccines. Arrow Farms makes it clear that they are not conventional gardeners.
[01:48.400 --> 01:53.960]  They are all about synthetic food products, which is clearly the trend in this growing
[01:53.960 --> 02:01.160]  industry. Monsanto is creating specially tailored genetically cut seeds for these vertical farms.
[02:01.160 --> 02:07.080]  And the University of California is developing a plant-based mRNA vaccine that farms can
[02:07.080 --> 02:12.880]  grow in heads of lettuce, which happens to be the main crop of these new farms. These
[02:12.880 --> 02:20.640]  GMO farms already provide food at major outlets, including Kroger, Walmart, and Whole Foods,
[02:20.640 --> 02:26.080]  and are massively expanding. And it's not only fresh produce that's getting genetically
[02:26.080 --> 02:34.600]  modified. The USDA and FDA have already approved genetic modifications on pigs, salmon, and
[02:34.600 --> 02:42.640]  cattle. And they have approved synthetic lab-grown meat. Bill Gates' Good Food Institute plans
[02:42.640 --> 02:49.920]  to reimagine meat production with $10 million of support from the USDA.
[02:49.920 --> 02:55.240]  But in order to make their big farm-of-food supply the new American model, they will need
[02:55.240 --> 03:02.120]  a major crisis. The 2020 lockdowns distressed the supply chain, which was further affected
[03:02.120 --> 03:08.960]  by U.S. sanctions against Russia. This has created a food shortage crisis. Add to that
[03:08.960 --> 03:15.440]  over a dozen food processing plants have mysteriously been destroyed in the past several weeks,
[03:15.440 --> 03:22.440]  as well as major fertilizer plants during a major fertilizer crisis. To make matters
[03:22.440 --> 03:29.240]  worse, Union Pacific Railroad forces a 20% reduction in shipments from the world's largest
[03:29.240 --> 03:36.200]  fertilizer company. And when the people demand a solution, as it turns out, Bill Gates is
[03:36.200 --> 03:42.280]  heavily invested in alternative fertilizers, and is also a chief stockholder of the Canadian
[03:42.280 --> 03:48.860]  National Railway, who claims to be helping the fertilizer market grow. Perhaps Bill
[03:48.860 --> 03:55.120]  Gates and Monsanto will volunteer to save everyone with their new gene-edited bacteria
[03:55.120 --> 04:01.720]  fertilizer. And maybe it will backfire like it did in Africa, when after 15 years of trying
[04:01.720 --> 04:10.080]  to help, all Gates and Monsanto accomplished was increasing starvation by 31%. But that's
[04:10.080 --> 04:16.560]  okay because it's Monsanto bear to the rescue with their big farm-of-food factories, with
[04:16.560 --> 04:23.520]  brand new mRNA vaccine lettuce. And as if this wasn't bad enough, the stated goal of
[04:23.520 --> 04:29.720]  this new franken food industry is to make all food traceable. And that means coding
[04:29.720 --> 04:37.300]  it all in nanotech. Who controls the food supply controls the people. Who controls the
[04:37.300 --> 04:44.640]  energy can control whole continents. Who controls money can control the world. Reporting for
[04:44.640 --> 04:46.640]  Infowars, this is Greg Rees.
[04:46.640 --> 04:53.640]  Boy oh boy, I mean you know how serious it is and then you see a Greg Rees report like
[04:53.640 --> 05:01.000]  that and it just reminds you.
[05:01.000 --> 05:06.840]  You see this? It's an Infowars Republic defense card with original Infowars art designed by
[05:06.840 --> 05:12.680]  yours truly with a little gold bar implanted in it, and on the back it's got a hologram.
[05:12.680 --> 05:17.720]  There are only 25,000 of these in existence and they'll never be made again. The bank
[05:17.720 --> 05:21.720]  that owns the mint that has started putting these out the last few years just sold out
[05:21.720 --> 05:27.720]  of 300,000 of a similar offering that was 40% more than what we're selling these for.
[05:27.720 --> 05:32.200]  And when you get three or more, you can get these at 50% off and they fund the Info War.

[05:37.080 --> 05:41.000]  It's a collector's item and you'll know you helped fund the second American Revolution

[05:49.240 --> 05:53.880]  because without you all of the great success we have had together would not have happened.
[05:53.880 --> 05:57.400]  We are the tip of the spear, you are the tip of the spear and I salute you and thank you.
[05:57.400 --> 06:14.200]  This is InfowarsTour.com today.
[06:14.200 --> 06:19.880]  Well, if you're just tuning in here on this Sunday, May 1st, wow, already the month of
[06:19.880 --> 06:25.240]  May in the year 2022. If you're just tuning in, you missed a very powerful Gregory's report.
[06:25.240 --> 06:31.800]  It's a banned on video. Big Pharma is set to control entire food supply and it's Bill Gates
[06:31.800 --> 06:39.640]  right in there as well. It's all the same suspects and I didn't intend to really get into that.
[06:39.640 --> 06:48.440]  I do have news on that front though. More food manufacturing plants are burning today on fire.
[06:48.440 --> 06:54.920]  But you see that report and it really lays it all out beautifully, doesn't it?
[06:56.280 --> 07:05.160]  And anybody that has an IQ above 60 should be able to read between the lines there.
[07:06.680 --> 07:14.840]  How massive, they want to demonize the rich synthetically so that you just hate
[07:14.840 --> 07:21.160]  your local millionaire or billionaire down the street or whatever that's in your city or your town.
[07:22.040 --> 07:27.240]  But then it's the super, super elite, the Bill Gates that are the ones that are actually acting
[07:27.240 --> 07:33.000]  like monopoly men but get praised by the mainstream media so that you don't think they're the bad guys
[07:33.000 --> 07:36.840]  even though they are the super rich that you should be concerned about.
[07:36.840 --> 07:45.320]  Buying up all the farmland, buying up all these new industries that are innovating food and tech
[07:45.320 --> 07:53.160]  into one and everything has a back door to control the individual.
[07:56.200 --> 08:00.600]  So it must just be a coincidence though, right? It must just be a coincidence that you're having
[08:00.600 --> 08:05.480]  all the food shortages. It must just be a coincidence the fertilizer shortages. It must just be a
[08:05.480 --> 08:10.680]  coincidence the war on Ukraine hurting that market. It must just be a coincidence Bill Gates
[08:10.680 --> 08:13.960]  buying up all the farmland. It must just be a coincidence that Bill Gates not only buying
[08:13.960 --> 08:18.440]  up all the farmland is also invested in all these new and up and coming food technologies.
[08:18.440 --> 08:26.840]  It's also probably a coincidence Bill Gates invested in railroad companies as that's the number one
[08:26.840 --> 08:36.040]  means of getting crops and everything across the country. It must all just be a coincidence.
[08:36.600 --> 08:41.000]  It must all just be a coincidence that Bill Gates also happens to be involved with viruses and
[08:41.000 --> 08:46.280]  vaccines and all of that and how there was a giant pandemic that somehow he knew and predicted and
[08:46.280 --> 08:50.520]  now he's saying there's going to be more. It just must all be a coincidence.
[08:50.520 --> 08:58.840]  I guess that's what Bill Gates would have you believe. He says get ready for pandemic number
[08:58.840 --> 09:05.560]  two. He says we've not seen the worst of covid. He wants to create a new pandemic response team
[09:05.560 --> 09:15.000]  called germ and so you just really need to understand what's happening here. These are
[09:15.000 --> 09:23.160]  mad scientist monopoly men going for world domination and whether you buy into the theory
[09:23.160 --> 09:32.280]  or the ideology that there are too many people or people become so fat lazy and decadent and
[09:32.280 --> 09:36.120]  stupid that they just need to just die off anyway. They're just useless eaters.
[09:36.120 --> 09:50.040]  This is the intellectual decision as they see it deeming themselves the stewards of the planet
[09:50.040 --> 09:59.960]  now. So whether everybody ends up starving or not it doesn't matter. They're still going to
[09:59.960 --> 10:06.840]  roll out all of this and force feed it to you in the name of man made climate change. So it'll be
[10:06.840 --> 10:13.800]  a situation where yeah the earth could go into such a period of turmoil or not even the earth
[10:13.800 --> 10:21.320]  necessarily the supply chain civilization could go into turmoil if the supply chain is disrupted
[10:21.320 --> 10:28.120]  and that continues and so yeah you'll need the Bill Gates GMO farming. You'll need the Monsanto
[10:28.120 --> 10:33.800]  GMO farming and so they get what they want either way. You're no longer eating real food. You're
[10:33.800 --> 10:39.400]  eating their synthetic food. You're no longer out there active on the planet causing carbon
[10:39.400 --> 10:47.960]  emissions which is not even the problem. They're going to get their monopoly power either way
[10:47.960 --> 10:53.720]  over all the travel over all the communication over all the food over all the medicine everything
[10:53.720 --> 11:00.200]  and the media and that's why they're so panicked at Elon Musk buying Twitter because he's not in
[11:00.200 --> 11:05.240]  their little club and I'm sure they've tried to bring him into the club. I'm sure they've tried
[11:05.240 --> 11:11.160]  to get him in and he's just not been interested. So that's what the freakout over Elon Musk is
[11:11.160 --> 11:19.240]  really about and the freakout continues by the way and Tulsi Gabbard seems to get it more and
[11:19.240 --> 11:27.160]  more every day here and then I've got this clip of CNN just freaking out. These people are just
[11:27.160 --> 11:32.600]  out of their minds. Senate Democrats consider calling Elon Musk to testify on Twitter by I
[11:32.600 --> 11:40.680]  think they're bluffing here but they may and so it'll just be adding more irony to the plot here.
[11:41.400 --> 11:46.440]  Oh yeah we called Facebook and Twitter and YouTube up to testify and they lied to our face
[11:46.440 --> 11:53.160]  and it was you know it was kind of a wink and a nod testimony like yeah you're not really
[11:53.160 --> 11:56.680]  under oath and you know we're all on the same side here so you know just show up and we'll go
[11:56.680 --> 12:02.280]  through the motions and then they did okay oh we're not censoring yep no no idea censoring huh
[12:02.280 --> 12:08.280]  what doesn't happen and then all the politicians nodded their head and said oh okay oh thank you
[12:08.280 --> 12:15.000]  for gracing us with your presence. You think that's how they'd treat Elon Musk if they got him up there?
[12:15.000 --> 12:22.120]  Somehow I don't. Tulsi Gabbard gets it though. Tulsi Gabbard says Obama is behind the ministry
[12:22.120 --> 12:29.320]  of truth. Joe Biden is just the front man and she's right. The evidence is pouring in. On April
[12:29.320 --> 12:35.480]  21st Obama said social media censors don't go far enough. Six days later his puppet Joe Biden
[12:35.480 --> 12:45.800]  rolled out the ministry of truth and I believe we've identified Obama's rat at Twitter as their
[12:45.800 --> 12:55.000]  lead counsel Vijaya Gade. I believe that that is Obama's rat and hopefully will soon be the former
[12:55.000 --> 13:01.320]  Obama rat in Twitter making 17 million dollars a year. Twitter's 17 million dollars per year
[13:01.320 --> 13:08.040]  censorship czar could get acts under Elon Musk at least that's the belief. I believe she was Obama's
[13:08.040 --> 13:16.120]  rat. I believe she was running all the censorship and I also believe she was intimidating Jack Dorsey
[13:18.120 --> 13:25.400]  with let's say potentials. She would present potentials to him say oh what if this happens
[13:25.400 --> 13:29.080]  what if this happens and this could happen and and Dorsey just not knowing any better and not
[13:29.080 --> 13:32.120]  wanting to get in any trouble probably just went along with it. She was the lawyer he went with
[13:32.120 --> 13:40.280]  probably recommended by Obama and that's how it all went down. At least that's my conspiracy
[13:40.280 --> 13:46.120]  theory but you're not allowed to do that anymore. You're not allowed to look at the facts and
[13:46.120 --> 13:50.600]  evidence and contemplate and discuss these things on the air. Obama says we should have a ministry
[13:50.600 --> 13:55.000]  of truth. Then Joe Biden does it. Obama meets with Dorsey and Gade and all these people and then
[13:55.000 --> 14:04.200]  they end up running Twitter and censoring all the people. Tulsi Gabbard gets it. Most of America
[14:04.200 --> 14:13.640]  gets it. I think Elon Musk gets it. We're catching on to you scumbags and you know the more and more
[14:15.800 --> 14:23.480]  we kind of just peel back the layers or just we sit here watching the old Biden administration
[14:23.480 --> 14:31.400]  destroying America. I think there's a new theme emerging which is the old theme that never really
[14:31.400 --> 14:36.200]  went away but was just kind of dormant because there was anything else going on. Barack Obama
[14:36.200 --> 14:43.640]  was really the worst thing to happen to this country. Barack Obama's radical left-wing Marxist
[14:43.640 --> 14:53.320]  communist hatred of America ideology really activated a virus in this country of hate
[14:54.920 --> 15:03.480]  and really activated a radical communist movement in this country the likes of which
[15:03.480 --> 15:12.760]  had never been seen and I even think Obama had is his own agenda outside of the globalist even.
[15:15.160 --> 15:19.160]  But they figured hey Obama's kind of a bad guy too. We'll cut deals with Obama
[15:20.840 --> 15:27.160]  and so that's why they ingratiated him so much to the American people but he's running his own
[15:27.160 --> 15:30.600]  deal and they just figured hey if Obama's going to try to destroy America that works for us anyway
[15:30.600 --> 15:37.560]  so go ahead. He implanted his ideological stay behinds all over the White House radical leftists.
[15:37.560 --> 15:44.760]  He implanted his ideological radical activists all over America like I think Gede at Twitter
[15:45.320 --> 15:50.760]  and I think it's all starting to be exposed ladies and gentlemen Barack Obama a radical
[15:50.760 --> 16:00.040]  Marxist communist leading an underground revolution to destroy America. You see this

[20:28.760 --> 20:32.120]  i really want to get into the story that is the headline of today's show though
[20:32.840 --> 20:39.080]  how the democrats had already unofficially announced that hey we're at war with russia
[20:39.080 --> 20:45.400]  ukraine is the battlefront and so we're going to have never-ending financial support for that
[20:45.400 --> 20:49.800]  and and weapons as well that was pretty much already determined that's pretty much already
[20:49.800 --> 20:56.920]  been accepted now they're just officially admitting that as you're getting crushed economically
[20:56.920 --> 21:05.800]  financially so badly in fact at the correspondence dinner radical leftist quote unquote comedian
[21:06.680 --> 21:13.640]  i'm not sure he doesn't say many things that are funny until the joke at the correspondence dinner
[21:13.640 --> 21:21.160]  last night trevor noah saying things under biden are looking up everything's looking up joe gas
[21:21.160 --> 21:30.680]  prices are up energy prices are up food prices are up that's that's funny and it's true so things are
[21:30.680 --> 21:35.720]  so bad now they're even allowed to joke about it but oh they're all rich they're all elite they're
[21:35.720 --> 21:42.280]  all in on it it's all a big joke to destroy america so let's laugh about how we're crushing the economy
[21:42.280 --> 21:46.840]  let's laugh about how the american people can't afford to live anymore
[21:48.200 --> 21:54.360]  oh yes it's fun it's fun by the way 50 billion dollars for ukraine thank you very much thank you
[21:54.920 --> 21:55.640]  that's nice
[22:00.120 --> 22:03.320]  democrats sorry americans you're just gonna have to learn how to eat
[22:04.200 --> 22:10.760]  eat on a very steep uh small budget you're gonna have to learn how to get around town
[22:10.760 --> 22:15.160]  without them being able to afford gas and you're gonna have to figure out you know you're not your
[22:15.160 --> 22:19.160]  wages aren't going up with the inflation you're gonna figure out how to heat and cool your home too
[22:19.160 --> 22:22.840]  i know it's all a disaster plus you see what's going on at your public schools they're teaching
[22:22.840 --> 22:27.480]  your kindergarten how to have uh you know anal sex and oral sex and you don't want to send them there
[22:27.480 --> 22:31.800]  but you can't really afford to home school them or send to a private school so yeah we're gonna
[22:31.800 --> 22:36.200]  we're gonna raise your kids for you too so uh it's all fine and good but don't worry
[22:36.200 --> 22:43.160]  as you're getting crushed we're gonna make sure ukraine gets plenty of money okay so just know that
[22:43.160 --> 22:47.400]  as you're starving as you can't fill your gas tank everything else just know the ukrainian war
[22:47.400 --> 22:53.720]  the the us versus russia in ukraine that's gonna get plenty of financial support and and we will
[22:53.720 --> 22:58.360]  probably eventually come to take your guns because you're a threat to the country that we hate and
[22:58.360 --> 23:03.160]  we're trying to destroy but uh you're a threat so we're probably gonna come and take your guns
[23:03.160 --> 23:07.320]  but don't worry we'll send them those guns over to ukraine yeah and there's pencil neck
[23:07.320 --> 23:14.280]  adam schiff and uh nasty pig loci they get to go to ukraine for a nice little photo op is all
[23:14.280 --> 23:18.760]  that is that's a beautiful little photo op and i guess just make sure that you know their portion
[23:18.760 --> 23:23.160]  of this 50 billion dollars is you know funneling to the right channels if you know what i mean
[23:24.360 --> 23:28.920]  hey you don't send 50 billion dollars over there without planning on looting some of it
[23:28.920 --> 23:33.720]  and you gotta send your top looters like nancy polosi over there probably training adam schiff
[23:33.720 --> 23:40.120]  showing him the ropes it's like hey we just sent 50 billion dollars to ukraine we gotta send somebody
[23:40.120 --> 23:45.320]  there's no oversight but we gotta send somebody over there to make sure that we're getting our cut
[23:45.880 --> 23:49.560]  send polosi over there was you know she's on her last leg she's an expert at this
[23:49.560 --> 23:54.440]  and send shift to he'll learn the ropes on how we steal money from the american people in foreign
[23:54.440 --> 23:58.760]  countries so so we'll keep that freak show around and polosi can kind of show him the ropes and then
[23:58.760 --> 24:03.960]  they go they do the whole grandstanding and remember 10 for the big guy don't forget about
[24:03.960 --> 24:10.680]  10 for the big guy now so what's really going on in ukraine well your money is getting stolen from
[24:10.680 --> 24:15.240]  you that's what's going on you're being distracted and you're being robbed blind
[24:18.360 --> 24:21.160]  that's what's really going on but you know what i'll come back to that
[24:21.160 --> 24:29.880]  i do want to play this clip from cnn freaking out about elon musk though because it's just
[24:29.880 --> 24:35.480]  all about the control and they even brag now i mean i call it brag call it's just admitting it
[24:35.480 --> 24:41.640]  they say we need to control the internet we need to control control control control control he
[24:41.640 --> 24:46.360]  literally just keeps saying control control so i mean i could sit here and i could pick this 90
[24:46.360 --> 24:53.160]  seconds apart just for all the leftist insanity that you hear here so here's cnn this weekend
[24:54.360 --> 25:01.480]  still in full panic that elon musk is not gonna allow conservatives and patriots and republicans
[25:01.480 --> 25:08.040]  to be censored on twitter this is panic central at cnn here it is no i think there's a bigger
[25:08.040 --> 25:12.600]  problem that when we focus on the personalities of people like elon muskin people say oh i think
[25:12.600 --> 25:18.680]  elon's thinking this or that there's a bigger problem here about how we are going to control
[25:18.680 --> 25:24.920]  the channels of communication in this country in 1927 we had the radio act 1934 the communication
[25:24.920 --> 25:30.440]  yes more government congress stepped in bigger government fcc was a government stepping in in
[25:30.440 --> 25:36.120]  your life regulating the broadcast industry fcc can't pause this i love this angle right here
[25:36.120 --> 25:44.600]  oh the fcc the fcc you understand this was actually a problem years ago they've backed off
[25:46.680 --> 25:53.640]  we would air drag queen story time footage which is for kids they do it at libraries they do it at
[25:53.640 --> 26:00.280]  schools they do it in churches now too yeah haha i went to a drag queen story time at a church
[26:00.280 --> 26:07.960]  yeah that footage is all banned off the internet though so i guess it doesn't exist i would show
[26:08.920 --> 26:14.360]  what happened on the alex joneshow syndicated on all the radio stations picked up on satellite tv
[26:14.360 --> 26:20.840]  stations some may have even dropped after this we would show you the literature that they're
[26:20.840 --> 26:27.080]  showing kids in grade school and and kindergarten depicting oral sex anal sex it's all in this
[26:27.080 --> 26:30.760]  literature now they brag about how though you've banned these books we're gonna make sure your
[26:30.760 --> 26:36.120]  kids get it anyway and we would show the drag queen story time with with full bearded men
[26:36.120 --> 26:43.240]  in in little stripper fairy tutus bouncing little boys and girls up and down on their
[26:43.240 --> 26:49.720]  erections and and on their male members while they have thongs on and and banana hammocks
[26:51.480 --> 26:56.760]  and we would show that and then local radio stations or satellite tv stations others
[26:56.760 --> 27:04.440]  would pick us up and they'd get complaints from the FCC oh oh oh i'm not allowed to show this on
[27:04.440 --> 27:12.120]  tv but they're allowed to show it to kids in kindergarten without their parents even present
[27:12.120 --> 27:20.440]  or knowing about it gotcha and when you understand that psychology you understand everything
[27:20.440 --> 27:28.120]  yeah we know what we're doing to the kids is bad but we're doing it for a good reason
[27:29.880 --> 27:34.760]  let's continue here on the freak out with cnn before we go to break what amongst our airwaves
[27:34.760 --> 27:41.000]  or our internet waves to mark zuckerberg and elon musk and we are in so much trouble now
[27:41.000 --> 27:44.760]  we're in trouble those guys believe in making money we've already seen that with the oh my
[27:44.760 --> 27:51.720]  gosh they believe in making money stop it guys stop it now pause it stop it oh my gosh they
[27:51.720 --> 28:00.680]  believe in making money wow i mean here's this guy on cnn we need more control control control
[28:00.680 --> 28:06.920]  bigger government more government involved in your life and oh my god these people like making
[28:06.920 --> 28:14.760]  money as if cnn doesn't have hundreds of millions of dollars as if this guy's probably not making
[28:14.760 --> 28:23.000]  at least six figures a year with it i mean oh continue i shouldn't say oh i think it's crazy
[28:23.000 --> 28:28.120]  to think they had any influence on this election musk is the same musk doesn't want it oh you know
[28:28.120 --> 28:31.800]  he's upset with the as they use the internet to influence elections they question them you know
[28:31.800 --> 28:37.720]  what i'm saying this is dangerous we can't think anymore in this country we don't know i'm serious
[28:37.720 --> 28:42.040]  we don't have people we're not allowed to think who can make all right there we go take it out oh
[28:42.040 --> 28:47.880]  we're not allowed to think oh who's stopping us from thinking i mean this again these people are
[28:47.880 --> 28:53.000]  lost in a world that doesn't exist i we're witnessing mass psychotic behavior here
[28:53.720 --> 28:57.880]  mass mental illness mass psychotic behavior american politics is just wild man

[36:09.240 --> 36:16.920]  put up with this it's really sad actually it's really quite sad in fact every saturday here in
[36:16.920 --> 36:22.040]  austin there's a group that goes out to the capital and doesn't i stand with ukraine
[36:24.520 --> 36:31.640]  protest or rally and you know i'm just trying to go have breakfast and it's saturday and
[36:31.640 --> 36:37.640]  and i just don't want to deal with it so it's like do i get out and do i try to talk to
[36:37.640 --> 36:42.200]  these people and i mean i can get the normal content i want just just showing how most
[36:42.200 --> 36:46.280]  of these people that go out and do these rallies and protests have no clue what it is they're
[36:46.280 --> 36:49.720]  talking about but with the ukraine people that you know they they fall for a different level
[36:49.720 --> 36:54.280]  of propaganda and i wonder who it is is it conservatives is it liberals is it what who's
[36:54.280 --> 36:59.800]  who's out here every saturday really standing with ukraine and i just say hey you know
[36:59.800 --> 37:05.160]  50 billion for ukraine you think that's a good idea oh yeah absolutely oh but really uh have
[37:05.160 --> 37:09.800]  you been down the street here not even a mile from here you can find about 50 to 100 homeless
[37:09.800 --> 37:14.920]  people many of them looking starving and decrepit probably abusing drugs you think that we maybe
[37:14.920 --> 37:18.200]  need some help here what about all the illegal immigrants that come in here that we have to
[37:18.200 --> 37:21.480]  pay for too that costs us hundreds of billions of dollars you think that costs us a little bit
[37:21.480 --> 37:25.880]  as well what about all your bills going up huh you like that your bills going up on every every
[37:25.880 --> 37:30.200]  aspect you like that huh consumer price index 50 billion for ukraine though that's a good thing
[37:30.200 --> 37:36.280]  okay all right uh do you know where that formula goes do you know that where that equation ends
[37:36.280 --> 37:43.080]  huh you get that no you don't do you or you wouldn't be out there but no they're out there every
[37:43.080 --> 37:49.720]  saturday and so there was also an anti-vaccine mandate protest going on out there too so it's
[37:49.720 --> 37:53.480]  just it's just the austin texas capital beautiful saturday so i guess people want to get out there
[37:53.480 --> 37:59.480]  but the stand with the ukraine people out there every saturday polosi and surprise trip to Kiev
[37:59.480 --> 38:08.760]  vows unbending u.s. support unbending so what does that mean you'll never stop sending billions
[38:08.760 --> 38:16.040]  of dollars to ukraine for probably the next 10 years and the proxy war which is it really is it
[38:16.040 --> 38:20.520]  see we're used to proxy wars but just kind of like cia front groups masquerading as
[38:20.520 --> 38:26.040]  moderate rebels or or you know whatever else isis isle it's all this other bogus crap
[38:27.160 --> 38:32.600]  they were in chechnya it's mincedam hussein it's it's it's all the same story so now
[38:32.600 --> 38:41.480]  the new proxy war is just ukraine ukraine is now a proxy of the corrupt western regime ukraine is
[38:41.480 --> 38:49.480]  now a proxy of the globalists so it's not like moderate rebel groups that occupy parts of afghanistan
[38:49.480 --> 38:58.040]  or iraq or or ukraine or russia no now it's just an entire proxy country that they launder
[38:58.040 --> 39:03.560]  money and weapons through and then used for geopolitical purposes in that region incredible
[39:03.560 --> 39:11.400]  advancement of corruption and they don't even hide it they don't even hide it by the way who
[39:11.400 --> 39:16.040]  do you think paid for polosi and adam shifts and the democrats trip to ukraine there's about 10
[39:16.040 --> 39:20.280]  democrats that went over there who do you think paid for that you think they paid for that or you
[39:20.280 --> 39:30.120]  think you did yeah stand with ukraine how much carbon do you think was emitted how much carbon
[39:30.120 --> 39:35.080]  do you think was emitted to travel 10 democrats to ukraine for a photo op and uh to just make
[39:35.080 --> 39:39.960]  sure their big giant money theft is going well how much carbon do you think was emitted for that
[39:39.960 --> 39:46.200]  huh well i have to think about that how many days did that cost us on this planet i think
[39:46.200 --> 39:51.720]  nancy polosi's trip to ukraine with 10 democrats probably cost us what two three days i mean that's
[39:51.720 --> 39:57.320]  a whole airplane flying over there so i mean now the earth is going to end two to three days sooner
[39:57.320 --> 40:01.800]  because of 10 democrats flying to ukraine to make sure their money laundering operation is going well
[40:01.800 --> 40:09.000]  are you okay with that liberals are you okay with that democrats that nancy polosi just
[40:10.200 --> 40:13.880]  put the expiration date of the planet three days closer
[40:16.520 --> 40:21.560]  man that's brutal stuff angeline a jolly can't get enough of herself
[40:22.520 --> 40:27.320]  angeline a jolly visits ukraine with no body armor to sign autographs wow
[40:27.320 --> 40:37.160]  wow so brave so brave pentagon spokesman chokes up while talking about ukraine oh he's
[40:37.160 --> 40:42.760]  he's crying now he's crying what about the couple police officers that got ambushed and
[40:42.760 --> 40:48.600]  murdered this weekend nah not interested in that what about the border patrol officers that drowned
[40:48.600 --> 40:53.240]  trying to stop drug dealers from drowning actually and save their lives but then they
[40:53.240 --> 41:00.200]  died what about them any tears for them no no and you know we really don't even talk about that
[41:02.360 --> 41:07.640]  bishop was the young man's name 22 years old jumps in to stop illegal immigrants from drowning
[41:07.640 --> 41:16.040]  ends up drowning himself they end up being drug dealers and this gets asked to gen sake like hey

[41:21.320 --> 41:27.080]  and now you're just ignoring this guy that gave his life bishop evans you're just gonna ignore him
[41:27.080 --> 41:30.840]  you're just not even gonna make a big deal and stock is up there like oh we don't comment on border
[41:30.840 --> 41:34.520]  patrol stuff if you want to talk about that go to dhs you want to talk about that go to border
[41:34.520 --> 41:41.240]  patrol oh really because you wanted to talk all about it when you were lying about border patrol
[41:41.240 --> 41:47.320]  agents using whips then you couldn't stop talking about it then it was all you wanted to talk about
[41:47.320 --> 41:53.800]  but when bishop evans gives his life trying to stop people from drowning that end up being drug
[41:53.800 --> 42:00.120]  dealers because a year open border policy then you don't want to talk about it i see i see how it is

[42:16.760 --> 42:21.480]  diplomatic resolution in ukraine and and they do these television interviews

[42:27.080 --> 42:30.680]  they do these tv interviews and they get asked like hey you know how come
[42:31.640 --> 42:35.400]  how come putin goes into ukraine when democrats are in the white house how come putin goes into
[42:35.400 --> 42:38.360]  ukraine when binds in the white house how come they didn't go in when trump was in there and they

[45:59.320 --> 46:05.640]  the globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare and with poisons and
[46:05.640 --> 46:10.600]  chemicals added to the food it's all come out and they're doing that not because we're weak but
[46:10.600 --> 46:16.760]  because we're made the image of god the creator and we are powerful and the social engineers
[46:16.760 --> 46:22.200]  fear that so much so that's why i repeat that famous internet saying that nobody knows who first
[46:22.200 --> 46:31.080]  came up with the boy is it true the propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was
[46:31.080 --> 46:36.120]  hopeless they need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural
[46:36.120 --> 46:43.400]  death because they know we are strong and they know in the end they signed on the god of this world
[46:43.400 --> 46:47.960]  who is a loser and that's why it's so important that everybody keep info wars in the air now more
[46:47.960 --> 46:52.840]  than ever because even if you don't believe in god what the globalists are manifesting and setting
[46:52.840 --> 46:57.880]  up is japan and we are opposing the one world government and the mark of the beast they just
[46:57.880 --> 47:16.680]  announced leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[47:16.680 --> 47:31.960]  well the correspondence dinner was just another display of left-wing arrogance and lies
[47:32.840 --> 47:37.160]  fowl she says oh i'm not going to attend the correspondence dinner it's just too risky with
[47:37.160 --> 47:42.520]  covid going around oh really because then he went to all the post parties without without a mask on
[47:42.520 --> 47:50.200]  just what a total scumbag he is all the attendees of the correspondence dinner did not have to wear
[47:50.200 --> 47:56.200]  a mask but the help did the peasants you know because that's how they view it and they like it
[47:56.200 --> 47:59.160]  that way they like seeing the little peasants running around in their match that makes them
[47:59.160 --> 48:02.520]  feel good about themselves that they get to dominate you did they get to subjugate you
[48:04.040 --> 48:11.080]  can you imagine being treated like that really what a sad thing it is but that's what you get
[48:11.080 --> 48:18.520]  it in washington dc with our politicians by the way you know manuel macrone this guy really he
[48:18.520 --> 48:22.840]  just won the election didn't he boy oh boy he really must have won the election guys just give
[48:22.840 --> 48:30.280]  me the b-roll of clip 15 here since macrone has won his reelection in france protests have not
[48:30.280 --> 48:35.800]  stopped they've not stopped even uh even the left-wingers are protesting macrone and so now
[48:35.800 --> 48:40.200]  farmers again this is not the first time they've done this in protest of macrone they did it a
[48:40.200 --> 48:48.600]  few years ago now they're back at it they're dumping uh entire loads of manure in power in
[48:48.600 --> 48:54.760]  powe france loads of manure being dropped off and some even being lit on fire and a lot of
[48:54.760 --> 49:01.160]  garbage as well and so this is just the continued protest of macrone in france it's been going on
[49:01.160 --> 49:06.840]  for years and uh but he won reelection folks even the left protest macrone the right and the left
[49:06.840 --> 49:12.920]  protest macron but he won his election i'm sure even though we had the same signs of election
[49:12.920 --> 49:20.760]  irregularities that we saw here in 2020 with macrone losing uh numbers being switched middle
[49:20.760 --> 49:29.400]  of the night numbers changing oh yes but pay attention pay no attention to this no no no no
[49:29.400 --> 49:37.800]  just the world being conquered and that's really what it is the international super elites they
[49:37.800 --> 49:42.520]  can operate and communicate completely off the off the map completely off the radar they're running
[49:42.520 --> 49:47.800]  schemes and operations and programs that governments can't even keep their eyes on or that they've
[49:47.800 --> 49:53.080]  already bought and paid for the governments that would begin with and of course it's always bill
[49:53.080 --> 50:01.880]  gates there he's always the one bill gates wants a covet 19 or a pandemic full-time pandemic emergency
[50:01.880 --> 50:10.520]  response team calling it germ yes bill gates please cute continue to just put yourselves in our way
[50:11.800 --> 50:16.120]  and he also says bill gates we've not seen the worst of covet oh really what do you know bill
[50:16.840 --> 50:20.760]  bill gates says this is just pandemic one what is it like year one now we're just resetting the
[50:20.760 --> 50:28.680]  calendar now under bill gates pandemic so it's not when the sun rises or sets or months it's just
[50:28.680 --> 50:31.960]  oh when bill gate says there's a pandemic all right you're in pandemic one all right pandemic
[50:31.960 --> 50:37.240]  one's over you're in pandemic two is that the new timetable now what day number are we in a pandemic
[50:37.240 --> 50:50.520]  one bill hmm i don't know what uh what number of day are we on of two weeks to slow the spread cdc
[50:50.520 --> 50:55.720]  quietly publish new rules for quarantine and isolation on last day of obama's presidency
[50:55.720 --> 51:02.920]  boy what does that make you think what does that make you wonder i'll tell you what it makes me
[51:02.920 --> 51:08.200]  think and wonder they planned that pandemic as soon as they learned trump won the election
[51:09.080 --> 51:14.440]  they started planning that pandemic and they knew they were going to use it to get him out of office
[51:15.320 --> 51:22.520]  to steal a bunch of money and to make up the ground of power grab that they lost when they
[51:22.520 --> 51:29.160]  didn't get their corrupt puppet hillary clinton in there and so here's what i've learned from my
[51:29.160 --> 51:33.880]  32 very short years on this planet i feel but things are starting to get a little more clear to me
[51:34.840 --> 51:41.720]  the same people have been running the same operations for certainly centuries maybe even
[51:41.720 --> 51:49.080]  longer than that and they've got bloodlines and they've got ancient texts and schematics and they
[51:49.080 --> 51:53.320]  know how to do all of it and they just did it again with this pandemic and i believe they've
[51:53.320 --> 51:59.080]  done it before i think they did the same thing with the spanish flu pandemic it's hard
[51:59.080 --> 52:04.920]  to go back in time considering i mean we see what gets written is history today and we know it's a
[52:04.920 --> 52:09.720]  lie imagine when we didn't have all the alternative media in the age of information going on imagine
[52:09.720 --> 52:13.560]  all the history that just is just a total lie that gets written in the textbooks that we can't even
[52:13.560 --> 52:20.600]  comprehend but boy oh boy i bet you start digging into the old spanish flu pandemic and looking
[52:20.600 --> 52:25.640]  in about all that stuff yeah there was a lot of chicanery that probably went down then too
[52:25.640 --> 52:31.640]  and by the way people have and they found a lot of it including the elites never wearing masks
[52:31.640 --> 52:36.520]  while everyone else did no now they're doing the same thing as a photo op it's all just them
[52:36.520 --> 52:43.400]  marking their territory like a dog pissing on a tree except the globalists do it in time and space
[52:43.400 --> 52:49.320]  as a continuum it's like here we are in 1920 teaching the peasants to wear a mask while we
[52:49.320 --> 52:56.680]  don't here we are in 2020 teaching the peasants to wear a mask and we don't see we really run this
[52:56.680 --> 53:08.760]  planet so yeah you think that the obama administrating writing all the new rules for quarantine and
[53:08.760 --> 53:14.760]  isolation right before he leaves office you think that's just a coincidence folks and then that was
[53:14.760 --> 53:21.160]  in a major factor of getting trump out of office the guy he illegally spied on obama that is
[53:21.160 --> 53:30.920]  yeah you think that's a coincidence huh yeah fiser announces pax levid is not effective at
[53:30.920 --> 53:41.560]  preventing covet 19 infection after biden purchases 20 million doses nice nice nice nice so we've
[53:41.560 --> 53:48.360]  spent billions on vaccines that don't work and now we've just spent more millions on a drug that
[53:48.360 --> 53:55.800]  doesn't work the masks that don't work the ventilators that don't work trump got duped into
[53:55.800 --> 54:01.000]  that too the vaccines that don't work trump gets duped into that now the pax levid that doesn't
[54:01.000 --> 54:08.120]  work biden gets duped into that it's it's just pathetic man it's just pathetic that we're enduring
[54:08.120 --> 54:14.120]  all of this victor davis hanson says the democrats are now the party of the elite and super rich
[54:15.080 --> 54:21.320]  you know you may be able to say that now but that can come that can change i think it's more
[54:21.320 --> 54:29.240]  important to sit back and actually and i kind of did this on the war room last week when elon
[54:29.240 --> 54:34.520]  must talked about the far left and the far right well what is the far left what is the far right
[54:34.520 --> 54:41.560]  what does that even mean anymore what does it mean to be a democrat what do democrats value
[54:42.120 --> 54:45.320]  what are the major issues for democrats what is on their playbook
[54:47.960 --> 54:52.920]  one thing to go off what they say but what are they actually doing democrats are the party of
[54:52.920 --> 54:59.720]  censorship they want to censor free speech democrats are the party of infringing on your
[54:59.720 --> 55:04.840]  second amendment they want to limit your rights to firearms and your right to protect yourself
[55:06.200 --> 55:12.040]  democrats are the party of war there was no expansion of war when trump was in office
[55:12.040 --> 55:18.680]  democrats have gotten in the war in ukraine is now raging and they're about to cut another
[55:19.400 --> 55:24.600]  30 billion dollar check to that proxy war that i'm sure they're gonna line their own pockets with
[55:24.600 --> 55:32.040]  the democrats are the party of death they like killing babies
[55:34.360 --> 55:43.320]  yeah and they are of course now the establishment party all the mainstream media
[55:43.960 --> 55:51.480]  leans liberal democrat hollywood leans liberal democrat and if you try to exist in those
[55:51.480 --> 55:57.160]  arenas and you're not a liberal democrat well then you don't exist in those arenas do you
[55:59.480 --> 56:07.000]  democrats are the party of open borders and invasions democrats are the party of crime
[56:07.640 --> 56:14.120]  every major city democrats run has already been worn down with crime and poverty but now it's
[56:14.120 --> 56:22.280]  just getting worse and worse by the day i mean that's good little is that your good little democrat
[56:22.280 --> 56:28.760]  party starter pack right there abort babies high crime open borders and invasion medical tyranny

[1:00:46.440 --> 1:00:52.520]  each other's blood might mislead people are like people are imagining us with like goblets and we're
[1:00:52.520 --> 1:00:58.280]  like game of thrones drinking each other's blood it's just a few drops but yes we do consume each
[1:00:58.280 --> 1:01:05.880]  other's blood on occasion for ritual purposes only in a tell all interview with glamour magazine

[1:01:12.440 --> 1:01:19.160]  drinking rituals it is used for a reason and it is controlled where it's like let's shed a few drops
[1:01:19.160 --> 1:01:23.880]  of blood and each drink it he's much more haphazard and hectic and chaotic where he's willing to just
[1:01:23.880 --> 1:01:31.800]  like cut his chest open with broken glass and be like take my soul let me bleed on you it doesn't
[1:01:31.800 --> 1:01:37.640]  not happen let me tell you maybe not exactly like that but it a version of that has happened

[1:02:26.840 --> 1:02:34.920]  or whatever fell out there it was like a voodoo doll there was a small bottle of blood did you
[1:02:34.920 --> 1:02:41.880]  and your sister ever had blood taken from you by ninja nilandi yes lots of times actually they
[1:02:41.880 --> 1:02:47.720]  take it they took us to like a place it's not really like a hospital or a private hospital some
[1:02:47.720 --> 1:02:52.360]  type of thing but it wasn't they took us there and they said it's like it's like a hospital but
[1:02:52.360 --> 1:02:57.960]  there was no cause they and then ninja took us in there it took our blood and then oh may you
[1:02:57.960 --> 1:03:02.680]  run the enemy go out and then ninja's the only one who stays in like inside the hospital like
[1:03:02.680 --> 1:03:08.600]  for 15 minutes or so then when he came out when he came out of there he had like a good bag in his
[1:03:08.600 --> 1:03:14.520]  hand and when he took out the things in the bag i saw a little bottle of blood inside the bag

[1:07:55.800 --> 1:08:05.240]  by the way they've they've attempted an antifa comeback and there are some pockets of antifa
[1:08:05.240 --> 1:08:10.520]  that that still exist and I guess get active like for example you know they're so pro woman
[1:08:11.320 --> 1:08:19.480]  but a guest of mine on the war room Kelly nighter had antifa spray on her door
[1:08:21.960 --> 1:08:26.920]  let's just say some very offensive language because you know it's the loving tolerant left but
[1:08:27.800 --> 1:08:32.280]  antifa is back out today or they tried to get antifa somebody paid for a big massive
[1:08:32.280 --> 1:08:39.480]  of marketing push to get antifa back on the streets for May day and they were supposed
[1:08:39.480 --> 1:08:45.240]  to be marching out here in Austin there was a rally for local police here they were marketing
[1:08:45.240 --> 1:08:48.440]  that antifa was going to show up I've got a couple friends that are out there they were
[1:08:48.440 --> 1:08:52.440]  going to tell me if antifa showed up not sure if they did same thing was happening in Dallas
[1:08:52.440 --> 1:08:56.840]  I know a guy in Dallas who's monitoring that so they're trying to make an antifa comeback
[1:08:56.840 --> 1:09:01.560]  I'm not sure if it's going to take though but I'll have more on that perhaps tomorrow
[1:09:01.560 --> 1:09:05.960]  or Harrison Smith maybe even with an update he's going to be hosting Sunday night live tonight
[1:09:08.120 --> 1:09:11.160]  let's see what else we have here as far as news is concerned on my desk
[1:09:11.880 --> 1:09:17.160]  misinformation fingerprints the Pentagon awarded fact-checking organization News Guard
[1:09:17.160 --> 1:09:25.160]  $750,000 last year yikes now this was originally proposed and executed by Obama I think Trump
[1:09:25.160 --> 1:09:32.120]  continued these contracts by the way but it's these leftist groups that basically engage in
[1:09:32.120 --> 1:09:37.400]  Democrat Party propaganda and censorship on the internet receiving government money
[1:09:39.640 --> 1:09:48.440]  totally criminal totally illegal totally against free speech as a principle and and just totally
[1:09:48.440 --> 1:09:53.480]  encompasses what the Democrat Party is up to but they'll fund themselves again don't worry I mean
[1:09:53.480 --> 1:09:59.880]  that's like low-level money laundering and fraud but you know we do it low they do it high DHS chief
[1:09:59.880 --> 1:10:06.040]  mayorkas gas lights disinformation board won't police free speech or monitor Americans really
[1:10:06.040 --> 1:10:11.800]  and and what is it going to do exactly then what is your misinformation disinformation
[1:10:11.800 --> 1:10:15.720]  ministry of truth going to do if you're not monitoring Americans and and policing their
[1:10:15.720 --> 1:10:20.280]  speech what is it going to do then I guess it doesn't exist I guess it just doesn't exist guys
[1:10:20.280 --> 1:10:27.160]  haha it doesn't exist it doesn't exist amazing it exists but it doesn't exist
[1:10:28.840 --> 1:10:33.320]  we're going to censor and watch for American speech online but we're not censoring and looking
[1:10:33.320 --> 1:10:39.000]  for American speech online what are you talking about and it's always oh there's no left-wing hate
[1:10:40.440 --> 1:10:46.760]  ever except it's always the left-wing victims of online right-wing terrorism right-wing terrorism
[1:10:46.760 --> 1:10:51.000]  they say may finally be able to sue the people who perpetuate it and so this is what it's all about
[1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:53.480]  this is what they're trying to do in Europe and this is now what they're gonna have to do in the
[1:10:53.480 --> 1:10:59.480]  US because they're afraid they don't control Elon Musk and they're just gonna say oh you said this
[1:10:59.480 --> 1:11:03.000]  or you did this on the internet you're now considered a terrorist and now you have no rights
[1:11:04.440 --> 1:11:08.680]  but forget about the left-wing doxing people forget about the left-wing and their death threats
[1:11:08.680 --> 1:11:12.440]  forget about the left-wing and then burning down buildings and attacking police officers
[1:11:12.440 --> 1:11:19.800]  forget about all that that's good terrorism your free speech as a conservative that's bad terrorism
[1:11:21.720 --> 1:11:25.640]  UK's general medical council to restrict what doctors can say online
[1:11:26.280 --> 1:11:32.760]  yeah the censorship in uh in the UK is really really bad really bad people get arrested over
[1:11:32.760 --> 1:11:37.800]  there and they've now got actual proposed legislation to just totally censor the internet
[1:11:37.800 --> 1:11:45.240]  so uh be glad you're not a dirty limey they're liars they're horrible people Sarah Palin on
[1:11:45.240 --> 1:11:50.920]  leaders of biden's ministry of truth is Sarah Palin gonna get back into the mix here seems
[1:11:50.920 --> 1:11:59.080]  like she should and uh she tells it like it is so maybe we could use her back in the political
[1:11:59.080 --> 1:12:06.600]  arena you know you look at the by the administration and it really is just laughable you've got the
[1:12:06.600 --> 1:12:13.160]  gay intern that's it's all about how he's gay so he dresses up in women's clothes and runs around
[1:12:13.160 --> 1:12:19.640]  the white house telling everybody how gay he is literally uh then you have the man that that
[1:12:19.640 --> 1:12:27.560]  pretends to be a woman Rachel Levine then you have the uh cross-dressing bisexual furry
[1:12:28.680 --> 1:12:35.640]  that uh they just promoted to be the uh nuclear guy the head of the nuclear so that's good and
[1:12:35.640 --> 1:12:44.520]  then their latest this uh Nina Jankovitz is just a complete disaster oh my gosh I mean folks
[1:12:45.640 --> 1:12:50.600]  imagine all the left-wing liberal insanity that you've seen over the years that we play it's like
[1:12:50.600 --> 1:12:55.400]  the comedy stuff they're screaming at the sky you know they're acting like banshees they're
[1:12:55.400 --> 1:13:00.360]  crawling around on the ground all the wildness not to mention all the propaganda they fall for
[1:13:00.360 --> 1:13:10.520]  she is the embodiment of all of it of all of it every every party lie every establishment false
[1:13:10.520 --> 1:13:15.880]  narrative and misbranding over the last five years she has fell for it hook line and sinker
[1:13:15.880 --> 1:13:23.960]  and promoted it russian collusion I mean just just just going on a hunter biden laptop on and on
[1:13:23.960 --> 1:13:31.080]  every single thing she just so I mean I consider and play all the videos the funny thing is I actually
[1:13:31.080 --> 1:13:38.520]  kind of like her because she seems like a real person yeah she's a complete moron but she actually
[1:13:38.520 --> 1:13:43.160]  seems like a real person I don't think anyone controls this woman uh I don't think anybody
[1:13:43.160 --> 1:13:48.920]  controls her I think she really speaks for herself I think she's really genuinely that stupid I actually
[1:13:48.920 --> 1:13:55.960]  don't mind that I'd rather have somebody in there that's just a complete fumbling idiot than somebody
[1:13:55.960 --> 1:14:02.040]  that's consciously out to get me because that's what she appears to be I mean folks we've got all
[1:14:02.040 --> 1:14:07.960]  the videos I don't even want to bother playing them because it's just more of the same crap that
[1:14:07.960 --> 1:14:12.440]  you've been saying for so long from just radical leftist just insane just the insane behavior
[1:14:12.440 --> 1:14:21.560]  but um wow I mean they are really they are really putting together quite a goon squad aren't they
[1:14:22.280 --> 1:14:32.040]  I mean they have really assembled an egg team I mean Jen Psaki seriously have you seen what
[1:14:32.040 --> 1:14:36.600]  the Biden administration has put in charge folks you know that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris aren't
[1:14:36.600 --> 1:14:44.600]  really getting along it's actually not a good thing they were supposed to have lunch every Sunday
[1:14:44.600 --> 1:14:49.240]  it was a thing I think it was every Sunday guys look this up if not I know I have the news story
[1:14:49.240 --> 1:14:53.400]  on my desk in the war room studio but just see if you about it Joe Biden and Kamala Harris never
[1:14:53.400 --> 1:14:57.240]  have lunch on Sunday they were supposed to have lunch every Sunday first of all you think they'd
[1:14:57.240 --> 1:15:01.240]  be working together every day but no that wasn't a thing so there was already they they already
[1:15:01.240 --> 1:15:08.440]  didn't like each other that came out during the Democrat debates Kamala knows she was just the
[1:15:08.440 --> 1:15:13.800]  token black woman as the vice president picked but but so she always had a chip on her shoulder
[1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:18.360]  so it's always been it's always been rough between Biden and Harris
[1:15:19.560 --> 1:15:24.120]  Biden has only had lunch with Kamala Harris twice this year despite his promise to dine together
[1:15:24.120 --> 1:15:29.400]  once a week so it's not going well and look the problem is Kamala's not getting along with Jill
[1:15:29.400 --> 1:15:34.360]  Joe Biden is crap in his britches he couldn't even go to lunch anyway and Kamala's got a
[1:15:34.360 --> 1:15:39.560]  chip on her shoulder and I think she wants to be the president and so this is all going on
[1:15:39.560 --> 1:15:44.920]  behind the scenes as the Democrat party is attempting to destroy America Kamala Harris is
[1:15:44.920 --> 1:15:50.440]  attempting to become the queen of the ashes Kamala Harris wants to be the queen of the rubble
[1:15:51.080 --> 1:15:53.720]  of Joe Biden's destroyed America
[1:15:53.720 --> 1:16:08.120]  if I had to describe with just one word the brainwashing the mind control the asleep prince
[1:16:08.920 --> 1:16:16.200]  but the general public is in the best word would actually be the people are lost just like you're
[1:16:16.200 --> 1:16:22.200]  lost to sleep or lost in a bad nightmare you're in a car I can get knocked out and you've lost

[1:16:30.360 --> 1:16:35.640]  what the globalists have done they have stunned us they have put us into a position of not knowing
[1:16:35.640 --> 1:16:39.720]  our bearings and then Klaus Schwab recently came out and gave him speech he called the great new
[1:16:39.720 --> 1:16:45.800]  narrative where he brags how the public is lost now the culture in the media has been driven to
[1:16:45.800 --> 1:16:50.440]  make sure the people are all alone so they can now guide humanity over the edge of a cliff

[1:22:17.160 --> 1:22:23.160]  let's just i mean this is an a team man we've got a real a team going here here's another member of
[1:22:23.160 --> 1:22:29.000]  the a team biden labor secretary covered for police union that enabled convicted child rapist
[1:22:30.680 --> 1:22:37.400]  a team joe biden's a team u.s department of labor secretary marty walsh protected records that showed
[1:22:37.400 --> 1:22:42.840]  the boston police union knew about a top officials history of child sex abuse during his tenure as
[1:22:42.840 --> 1:22:50.600]  boston mayor patrick rose former president of boston's police union pled guilty to 21 child rape
[1:22:50.600 --> 1:22:56.680]  and sexual assault counts on monday walsh's successor as mayor released records that showed the
[1:22:56.680 --> 1:23:02.200]  police conducted an internal investigation into rose after he allegedly sexually assaulted a 12
[1:23:02.200 --> 1:23:12.440]  year old boy and the uh liberal police union covered it all up you think that uh all the anti cop
[1:23:12.440 --> 1:23:18.280]  marches are going to happen over this story no because they're puppet masters in the mainstream
[1:23:18.280 --> 1:23:25.720]  media aren't telling them to march they'll march against something else rhinos and democrats just
[1:23:25.720 --> 1:23:30.920]  stole future elections in deep red alaska and the republican party did not lift a finger to fight it
[1:23:32.120 --> 1:23:37.320]  and this is all going to come out more of it at least with 2000 mules denesh desuza and
[1:23:37.320 --> 1:23:43.000]  salem media will release the much-anticipated movie 2000 mules on the 2020 presidential election
[1:23:43.000 --> 1:23:49.320]  heist and uh the democrats are in big fear of this one they don't want you to know how they
[1:23:49.320 --> 1:23:56.680]  stole the 2020 election but you probably already do new york times reporters mansion would have
[1:23:56.680 --> 1:24:04.440]  given the senate control to the gop but he didn't like mcconnell so mcconnell has got to go absolutely
[1:24:04.440 --> 1:24:08.200]  got to go you know by the way the new york times had a hit piece on tucker carlson maybe i still have
[1:24:08.200 --> 1:24:18.600]  this up nope i think i lost it on my phone they did a hit piece on tucker carlson and it was funny
[1:24:18.600 --> 1:24:24.760]  because they said tucker carlson believed in all these different conspiracy theories but everything
[1:24:24.760 --> 1:24:31.240]  that they listed as a conspiracy theory has actually come true yeah unfortunately i lost it guys that's
[1:24:31.240 --> 1:24:38.600]  okay but it's just funny it's just funny when uh you see this it's like oh there's a open border
[1:24:38.600 --> 1:24:45.560]  it's like oh that's a conspiracy theory what like 10 million illegals have poured in the last three
[1:24:45.560 --> 1:24:55.160]  years conspiracy theory open border huh okay gotcha gotcha i see how that works then let me ask
[1:24:55.160 --> 1:25:00.120]  the world health organization and the international health regulations is probably a conspiracy
[1:25:00.120 --> 1:25:05.080]  theory as well isn't it the world health organization i don't know where this first came from but
[1:25:05.080 --> 1:25:10.200]  don't you dare dot info is where you can find it don't you dare dot info i'll just read all these out
[1:25:10.200 --> 1:25:17.320]  in fact i'm gonna have to come back and do this because it's too important but you're about to

[1:33:33.720 --> 1:33:43.560]  this planet is a virus a virus that they can make and manipulate in a lab and release and then use
[1:33:43.560 --> 1:33:49.480]  the media that they control to drive up the fear and then use the government they control to drive
[1:33:49.480 --> 1:33:56.520]  up the propaganda and ultimately the control and this worked so well in the year 2020 with covid
[1:33:57.480 --> 1:34:05.240]  they are now going to have a repeat power grab but go for everything in their latest attempt
[1:34:05.240 --> 1:34:09.400]  with the world health organization and an international health regulations meeting that
[1:34:09.400 --> 1:34:20.440]  is set to kick off now here's the problem with society and that's the naive nature that people
[1:34:20.440 --> 1:34:25.880]  have to think hey the person on tv is telling me the truth hey the person in government telling
[1:34:25.880 --> 1:34:34.600]  me the truth they're not out to get me why would they lie to me that ignorance that naive nature
[1:34:34.600 --> 1:34:41.960]  needs to go and i think it has for a lot of people but hey you'd understand deadly virus might get
[1:34:41.960 --> 1:34:46.280]  you sick might get your friends sick whatever all right let's figure it out let's get it under control
[1:34:47.640 --> 1:34:50.520]  doesn't mean you should shut down doesn't mean there's gonna be government tyranny but hey yeah
[1:34:50.520 --> 1:34:55.320]  there's a deadly virus going around you're concerned about it overly rational but then you
[1:34:55.320 --> 1:34:59.880]  learn how it was made a lab then you learn how it was lied we were lied to about it and everything
[1:34:59.880 --> 1:35:04.280]  else and now here we are two years later they're still driving up the fear they're making you take
[1:35:04.280 --> 1:35:10.680]  experimental medicines that kill you and they're getting ready to go for their total power grab
[1:35:10.680 --> 1:35:16.280]  and because we didn't learn the lesson in 2020 they're gonna ratchet it up even bigger now so
[1:35:16.920 --> 1:35:23.640]  you can find this entire pamphlet if you want to try to wake friends and family up at don't
[1:35:23.640 --> 1:35:28.840]  you dare dot info and so let me just briefly explain this and i'm going to read to you the seven
[1:35:28.840 --> 1:35:35.480]  bullet points here that's so so important because their successful power grab in the name of coveted
[1:35:35.480 --> 1:35:42.520]  in 2020 they're now going for broke they want total control over your body they want total control
[1:35:42.520 --> 1:35:46.280]  over your movements and they want total control over your country and they're going to use pandemics
[1:35:46.280 --> 1:35:52.680]  to do it bill gates brags about it and it's his buddy anthony fouchie and peter dosik that were
[1:35:52.680 --> 1:35:58.600]  all involved in the creation of coveted and who knows what else they're up to so that's what they do
[1:35:58.600 --> 1:36:04.840]  is they make viruses they release the viruses they didn't have the pandemics whether they're
[1:36:04.840 --> 1:36:10.120]  synthetic or real 2020 covid was not a real pandemic there could be real pandemics they
[1:36:10.120 --> 1:36:14.520]  could release a real pandemic on this country i'm if they have the capabilities they probably will
[1:36:14.520 --> 1:36:17.560]  and they're warning about it they're saying yeah bioterrorists are going to release a pandemic
[1:36:17.560 --> 1:36:23.240]  well bill gates is bioterrorist now then i guess so here's the power grab that the world health
[1:36:23.240 --> 1:36:28.920]  organization and you know our politicians are all going to let them do this too the world health
[1:36:28.920 --> 1:36:33.720]  organization is attempting a power grab most people have never heard of the international
[1:36:33.720 --> 1:36:41.960]  health regulations the united states agreed to the ihr in 2005 these regulations override and
[1:36:41.960 --> 1:36:46.520]  supersede the u.s constitution well that's what they claim of course they don't actually
[1:36:46.520 --> 1:36:52.760]  but but neither did all their coveted stuff and somehow that was okay on january 18th 2022 the
[1:36:52.760 --> 1:36:58.280]  united states submitted a number of amendments to the ihr that serve to give away even more of our
[1:36:58.280 --> 1:37:03.720]  sovereignty and greatly empower the world health organization to restrict your health related
[1:37:03.720 --> 1:37:09.880]  rights and freedoms the 77 the 75th meeting of the world health assembly will be held
[1:37:09.880 --> 1:37:17.080]  in geneva switzerland this may 22nd through the 28th 2022 the assembly will vote on the
[1:37:17.080 --> 1:37:22.280]  amendments to the ihr they are very likely to pass and be enacted to the international law
[1:37:22.280 --> 1:37:25.560]  unless we the people stand up against this attack on our sovereignty so imagine the by
[1:37:25.560 --> 1:37:30.600]  the administration says here world health organization take america's freedoms take
[1:37:30.600 --> 1:37:36.120]  the people of america's freedoms here's power for you take away power from us and take it
[1:37:36.120 --> 1:37:39.800]  and you control our people do you think the world health organization is going to reject that
[1:37:40.840 --> 1:37:48.760]  no and they know it it's all already worked out folks this is just a ceremony that's coming
[1:37:48.760 --> 1:37:53.480]  up later this may they've already signed this country away folks the ceremony is just about to
[1:37:53.480 --> 1:37:58.680]  begin these amendments to the international health regulations do not need to be approved by two-thirds
[1:37:58.680 --> 1:38:04.280]  of the us senate we have already agreed to obey the ihr by virtue of our membership in the united
[1:38:04.280 --> 1:38:09.880]  nations and the world health organization which we need to get out of immediately we are already
[1:38:09.880 --> 1:38:15.640]  given away some of our sovereignty these amendments are designed to confuse the member nations into
[1:38:15.640 --> 1:38:22.040]  giving away even more of their sovereignty in addition to the proposed amendments to the ihr
[1:38:22.040 --> 1:38:28.520]  the who has also set up an intergovernmental negotiating body that is actively negotiating
[1:38:28.520 --> 1:38:35.160]  an international treaty on pandemic prevention preparedness and response the proposed pandemic
[1:38:35.160 --> 1:38:40.520]  treaty is separated from and in addition to the proposed amendments to the international health
[1:38:40.520 --> 1:38:45.240]  regulations mentioned above and you'll have the same elites the same groups and everybody running
[1:38:45.240 --> 1:38:51.720]  these international confabs taking your sovereignty forcing you into lockdowns forcing you into
[1:38:51.720 --> 1:38:56.600]  quarantines forcing you to take injections and and all of a sudden you're just a slave
[1:38:56.600 --> 1:39:02.920]  in a permanent pandemic the pandemic treaty does not yet exist it is being drafted and
[1:39:02.920 --> 1:39:07.960]  negotiated right now wonder if bill gates has any involvement in this discussions regarding the
[1:39:07.960 --> 1:39:13.480]  pandemic treaty are important but they are also part of the sophisticated diversion to confuse
[1:39:13.480 --> 1:39:18.200]  people and get them to ignore the immediate concern which is the amendments to the ihr
[1:39:18.200 --> 1:39:24.040]  being considered by the world health assembly this may 22nd through 28th the time to speak out
[1:39:24.040 --> 1:39:31.400]  and stand up for your rights is now you can find this and more at don't you dare dot info don't
[1:39:31.400 --> 1:39:39.160]  you dare dot info and i'm sure if they haven't already the big tech sensors are out to censor
[1:39:39.160 --> 1:39:45.240]  that website and censor this information from getting out now let me try to take something
[1:39:45.240 --> 1:39:55.480]  complex and boil it down for you the agreements have already been made decades ago that the only
[1:39:55.480 --> 1:40:01.960]  way for humanity going forward is a world government and the very same people that reached
[1:40:01.960 --> 1:40:05.880]  these intellectual conclusions at the bill de berg group davos group and all these other things
[1:40:05.880 --> 1:40:11.480]  have been operating in the shadows and under cover for a long time but they can't anymore
[1:40:12.680 --> 1:40:16.760]  so now they're forced to come to the surface and convince you it's for your own good
[1:40:16.760 --> 1:40:20.280]  it's a response to a pandemic it's response to global warming whatever it is
[1:40:22.440 --> 1:40:29.560]  the agenda is global government the agenda is world government but who would willingly step
[1:40:29.560 --> 1:40:36.920]  into that how could you do that without major fallout well you couldn't unless you tricked
[1:40:36.920 --> 1:40:42.600]  people into believing it was for their own health and that's what they're doing so this is all about
[1:40:42.600 --> 1:40:52.680]  global government and then on the back end they want to convince americans to not be proud of
[1:40:52.680 --> 1:41:02.120]  being an american not understand how important our god-given rights are here but to hate america
[1:41:02.120 --> 1:41:09.240]  reject your rights so that when this day comes and a global government international organization
[1:41:09.240 --> 1:41:14.200]  comes to take over your country you don't want to fight it you're so scared of a pandemic you're
[1:41:14.200 --> 1:41:20.280]  so scared of the sun or you just hate america so much that you just lay down and you say good
[1:41:20.280 --> 1:41:24.920]  i'm glad that the world health organization is taking over look people don't even respect a
[1:41:24.920 --> 1:41:32.760]  pandemic look people still eat meat and drive cars look america still exists the racist misogynistic
[1:41:32.760 --> 1:41:39.480]  bigoted country and they'll celebrate being conquered they will cheer as they shackle
[1:41:39.480 --> 1:41:45.320]  themselves up to be permanent slaves so that's what this is all about
[1:41:45.320 --> 1:41:55.880]  and now here you are on may 1st 2022 three weeks away for them kicking off their ceremony
[1:41:57.080 --> 1:42:00.040]  where they're going to clink glasses and celebrate that they're going to get it on
[1:42:00.040 --> 1:42:06.600]  paper that they have conquered you now they're not going to show up tomorrow for this maybe
[1:42:06.600 --> 1:42:14.760]  and even not next month but they sign this treaty they sign over our sovereignty you're going to see
[1:42:14.760 --> 1:42:19.400]  the covid pandemic part two and it's going to be 10 times worse it's going to be like china it's
[1:42:19.400 --> 1:42:24.040]  going to be like australia and you try to bring up the constitution you try to bring up the bill
[1:42:24.040 --> 1:42:27.960]  of rights you try to bring up freedoms it's not going to matter and they're going to try to lock
[1:42:27.960 --> 1:42:36.520]  us down so all they're doing is giving themselves the right to end your sovereign state a country
[1:42:36.520 --> 1:42:43.320]  or individual and then give themselves the right an international governing board faceless nameless
[1:42:43.320 --> 1:42:50.120]  never voted for to come lock you up in a prison in the name of stopping a pandemic and they're
[1:42:50.120 --> 1:42:54.840]  getting ready to have their ceremony that they're going to take that power from you and it's coming

[1:47:39.800 --> 1:47:42.760]  i said yeah here's probably what's wrong here's the supplement you should get from info wars

[1:47:54.680 --> 1:47:59.800]  went to get some work done to figure out these problems i was having in in the weight room
[1:47:59.800 --> 1:48:03.880]  they said yeah the uh after the work i done the doctors it pretty much said exactly what you said
[1:48:03.880 --> 1:48:08.680]  i said really and and how much did you pay to have that diagnosis they did 500 bucks i said oh
[1:48:08.680 --> 1:48:12.840]  okay so hey good they figured out but i already knew what i was talking about the whole time
[1:48:12.840 --> 1:48:20.680]  um folks most people are magnesium deficient magnesium is one of the key elements to the
[1:48:20.680 --> 1:48:25.080]  enzyme function in in your body if you are magnesium deficient you're going to have problems
[1:48:25.080 --> 1:48:31.240]  get the fizzy magnesium from info wars store dot com folks if you have achiness or or um tightness
[1:48:31.240 --> 1:48:36.600]  like cramping you're probably magnesium deficient so and that's just one aspect
[1:48:37.560 --> 1:48:41.320]  you know i'm just saying the supplements are the real deal met fizzy magnesium incredible most
[1:48:41.320 --> 1:48:46.120]  people are deficient in nasan iodine or iodine we have the best nasan iodine survival shield x2

[1:48:49.800 --> 1:48:54.200]  ourselves that's why they hate us so much because they can't shut us down because you fund us with
[1:48:54.200 --> 1:48:59.800]  our own products it's an amazing victory we're having here now uh donald trump is actually
[1:48:59.800 --> 1:49:04.920]  live right now he's in nebraska having a rally i figured we'd pop in real quick i'm guessing there's
[1:49:04.920 --> 1:49:09.640]  probably at least 20 000 people there joe biden couldn't fill a broom closet uh but uh let's
[1:49:09.640 --> 1:49:15.080]  check out uh trump's rally right now he's speaking in nebraska here he is thousands of patriots that
[1:49:15.080 --> 1:49:20.440]  went around the country viewing tape you know all those fake i call them the unlock boxes not the
[1:49:20.440 --> 1:49:25.720]  lock they're unlock boxes because you unlock them i wonder what they did when they were unlocked
[1:49:25.720 --> 1:49:32.120]  but i call them the unlock boxes they have tapes of all those boxes and these incredible women
[1:49:32.120 --> 1:49:38.040]  headed up by catherine engelbrecht who's an incredible patriot she uh they went around and they
[1:49:38.040 --> 1:49:48.600]  they looked at miles and miles of tape film tape and they found uh millions and millions of phony
[1:49:48.600 --> 1:49:54.360]  votes and you know what's gonna happen maybe nothing you know maybe nothing isn't it sad
[1:49:55.160 --> 1:50:00.280]  the fake news doesn't want to talk about it they don't want to talk about anything bad
[1:50:00.280 --> 1:50:03.720]  for the democrats they don't want to talk the biggest thing they don't want to talk about
[1:50:03.720 --> 1:50:08.440]  though is the election because they know the result and they don't want it that's too close
[1:50:08.440 --> 1:50:13.720]  we're too close we're not too close we know the results you know the biggest lie of all
[1:50:13.720 --> 1:50:18.840]  is when they say the big lie you ever see these stories when these fakers they write stories
[1:50:18.840 --> 1:50:25.720]  and they say wow there's absolutely no proof we got truckloads in every state wisconsin you see
[1:50:25.720 --> 1:50:31.640]  what's going on in wisconsin where they have almost a hundred percent in senior citizens facility
[1:50:31.640 --> 1:50:37.320]  supported supposedly voted but in years past very few people voted you know why they have other
[1:50:37.320 --> 1:50:43.720]  problems they don't care about trump i don't blame them they want to live they can't breathe
[1:50:43.720 --> 1:50:50.840]  one person came up my mother's comatose she hasn't been able to speak for over a year
[1:50:51.800 --> 1:50:57.640]  and they're saying she voted in the election honestly she didn't care about the election
[1:50:57.640 --> 1:51:04.200]  she has much bigger problems but they had almost a hundred percent of the people in wisconsin voting
[1:51:04.200 --> 1:51:09.000]  and they have a man just as gableman a very highly respected man he's fantastic
[1:51:09.000 --> 1:51:15.320]  he's a fantastic man and he's he's issued a report that's just so horrible so damning
[1:51:15.320 --> 1:51:20.120]  as to we're like a third world country and we're third world with the press too because they're
[1:51:20.120 --> 1:51:27.160]  among the most dishonest people every sentence i read something today in one of our main papers
[1:51:27.160 --> 1:51:32.520]  almost every sentence every time they talk about the election while nothing has been proven while
[1:51:32.520 --> 1:51:38.360]  this it's all out there it's there and this one's going to be interesting because david was great
[1:51:38.360 --> 1:51:44.440]  what he did with the 417 million how it went to mostly democrat areas and i can't believe it's legal
[1:51:44.440 --> 1:51:50.360]  david i just can't believe it but when you watch this one that's coming out now and i'm not necessarily
[1:51:50.360 --> 1:51:55.800]  talking about the movie or the documentary but that covers it to an extent but they have
[1:51:55.800 --> 1:52:00.760]  much more even than that when they release their findings next week or the week after
[1:52:01.640 --> 1:52:08.200]  millions and millions of votes and they focused on swing states they didn't focus on others they
[1:52:08.200 --> 1:52:14.120]  probably did something there too the bad people the corrupt people but the swing states were
[1:52:14.120 --> 1:52:20.440]  devastating and the information they found was devastating and i could go over things like
[1:52:20.440 --> 1:52:26.920]  left and right when you look at what happened in detroit was so bad philadelphia was so bad
[1:52:26.920 --> 1:52:33.800]  atlanta was so bad that governor did nothing i got him in when i endorsed him i got this guy
[1:52:33.800 --> 1:52:39.640]  elected he did nothing and one thing has nothing to do with the other but i'll tell you what he
[1:52:39.640 --> 1:52:44.840]  did nothing for the people of georgia the people of this country he didn't want to know about it i
[1:52:44.840 --> 1:52:49.800]  think he was embarrassed by how bad it was and he didn't want it down on his watch and that's not
[1:52:49.800 --> 1:52:55.400]  what it's about and frankly if he did the right thing it would have been a positive for him it
[1:52:55.400 --> 1:53:00.440]  would have been a positive he's like afraid of the stacey abrams i don't know what the hell's
[1:53:00.440 --> 1:53:06.040]  going on there but he's done such a bad job and i hope they get out by the way charles w and vote
[1:53:06.040 --> 1:53:11.480]  for david perdu i do hope so because he's in there fighting right so uh trump still having
[1:53:11.480 --> 1:53:16.520]  massive rallies uh again you know biden can't fill a broom closet but yeah 90 million votes
[1:53:16.520 --> 1:53:21.560]  whatever they claim i'm sure i'm sure that's uh went down ladies and gentlemen you know it's
[1:53:21.560 --> 1:53:24.760]  frustrating i mean look they stole the election it's so obvious but you know you'll get arrested
[1:53:24.760 --> 1:53:30.520]  for even saying it and uh we'll see what comes out i mean everybody's really anticipating i've
[1:53:30.520 --> 1:53:36.200]  heard this next documentary from denistra suzer is just going to be really key in exposing the
[1:53:36.200 --> 1:53:41.480]  election fraud and awakening america but trump here alluding that he has knowledge that they're
[1:53:41.480 --> 1:53:47.080]  about to release some other findings about how they stole michigan and pennsylvania which i mean
[1:53:47.080 --> 1:53:54.120]  yeah a five-year-old kid could figure that out when you see that in michigan and pennsylvania
[1:53:54.120 --> 1:53:58.440]  biden got 300 000 votes in five seconds and then they stopped counting magically at two in the
[1:53:58.440 --> 1:54:04.440]  morning a two-year-old could figure that out so that's how it goes let me finish up with my news
[1:54:04.440 --> 1:54:07.800]  coverage here before harrison smith takes over he may want to go to the trump rally may have other
[1:54:07.800 --> 1:54:10.840]  news coverage may want to take your calls i'm not sure but he's going to be taken over here
[1:54:10.840 --> 1:54:17.400]  on sunday night live another food plant catches fire in virginia a midwave of destroyed food
[1:54:17.400 --> 1:54:25.480]  facilities folks this is uh getting out of control where's the fbi you've had dozens of food manufacturing

[1:54:49.800 --> 1:54:55.400]  side down the other yeah but uh figuring out what's going on at the food plants and the fertilizer
[1:54:55.400 --> 1:55:02.360]  plants no no they can't figure that out the fbi is looking for white supremacists too and they
[1:55:02.360 --> 1:55:07.720]  can't find them amazing isn't it dhs had can't name one single case that he referred to the
[1:55:07.720 --> 1:55:12.200]  department of justice for white supremacy or domestic terrorism couldn't find one couldn't

[1:55:32.680 --> 1:55:37.640]  that alex jones and info wars has ever done it's the police state documentaries one through four
[1:55:38.600 --> 1:55:42.120]  and you know it's amazing the liberal left should be all over this they hate the police state but
[1:55:42.120 --> 1:55:48.120]  it's you know when they when they hate alex jones they forget how much alex jones has fought against
[1:55:48.120 --> 1:55:57.160]  police corruption throughout his time and um we we all can understand that but uh all four police
[1:55:57.160 --> 1:56:05.320]  state documentaries are now on band out video very powerful stuff and it really just puts it back
[1:56:05.320 --> 1:56:13.000]  into perspective on a timeline of zooming out and going back in time that we have been in this
[1:56:13.000 --> 1:56:17.080]  agenda to conquer america and overthrow our sovereignty for a long time we're just really
