[08:48.600 --> 08:54.480]  is going through incredible technological societal changes right now and
[08:54.480 --> 09:00.600]  the ruling elite the parasites the global corporate fascist controllers of
[09:00.600 --> 09:05.760]  this globe have been waging a war against individuality a war against the
[09:05.760 --> 09:10.640]  family a war against real intellectual political debate where they have
[09:10.640 --> 09:18.480]  created scores of different false flavors of political ideas and choices
[09:18.480 --> 09:24.040]  but they are only different on the surface and more and more people are
[09:24.040 --> 09:29.720]  awakening to the fact that we live in a engineered society and more and more
[09:29.720 --> 09:36.080]  people are first freeing their minds and then attempting to move off the grid at
[09:36.080 --> 09:40.880]  least as much as they can so that they are not fully under the control of the
[09:40.880 --> 09:46.600]  social engineers that are playing God with our lives in the words of Bob

[12:12.960 --> 12:19.440]  puppet Queen is now fully anglicizing our country turning us into anglophiles
[12:19.440 --> 12:24.240]  that we rebelled against in 1776 and you notice that most the presenters are now
[12:24.240 --> 12:28.560]  phasing into being British we're told to worship the Queen disgusting
[12:28.560 --> 12:34.000]  statements about how dare Obama not properly grovel and execute the
[12:34.000 --> 12:42.080]  ceremony before the living Pharaoh Queen Elizabeth the second and the media
[12:42.080 --> 12:47.960]  agonizes over the fact that all of the worship is not being executed properly
[12:47.960 --> 12:52.880]  while Obama and the Royals sip thousand dollar a glass of vino let them eat cake
[12:52.880 --> 12:58.440]  while the society degenerates and millions more than 15 million starve
[12:58.440 --> 13:03.160]  each year predominantly because of globalist policies in the third world
[13:03.160 --> 13:08.000]  we're gonna be breaking that down also obviously smoking gun government
[13:08.000 --> 13:12.200]  moles alerted investigator of planted Obama birth certificate two months

[13:24.880 --> 13:30.200]  certificate they had people inside the health department in the stacks and then
[13:30.200 --> 13:33.960]  they alerted him three weeks before that the birth certificate had been inserted
[13:33.960 --> 13:39.480]  and that Obama has basically taken the bait in the sting so that is up on
[13:39.480 --> 13:45.200]  info wars dot com and prison planet dot com with the here to four never
[13:45.200 --> 13:51.040]  published world net daily article the other four drafts total of five big
[13:51.040 --> 13:56.000]  breaking news on that front we'll be breaking that down more later in the
[13:56.000 --> 14:03.320]  broadcast obviously violent storms killed another 13 in Oklahoma Kansas and
[14:03.320 --> 14:11.120]  Arkansas 124 dead as more tornadoes head towards Joplin Missouri that was last
[14:11.120 --> 14:22.120]  night it's well over 500 people dead now images of a hospital devastated biggest
[14:22.120 --> 14:27.240]  storm system in years hits Dallas Fort Worth hopes and prayers go out to those
[14:27.240 --> 14:35.640]  folks you know in the old days 50 60 in the old days back in grandpappy's days
[14:35.640 --> 14:42.000]  everybody even in the big cities had a little garden bought food at the market
[14:42.000 --> 14:45.920]  if they had to they didn't have a garden or a small plot of land or farm they
[14:45.920 --> 14:50.000]  canned things instinctively humans knew how to knit they knew how to produce
[14:50.000 --> 14:54.160]  their own clothes humans knew how to plow a field how to grow tomatoes
[14:54.160 --> 14:59.520]  universally across the planet it's an instinct like the ant who prepares for
[14:59.520 --> 15:02.920]  the winter the grasshopper doesn't we all know that parable the grasshopper dies
[15:02.920 --> 15:08.760]  the ant doesn't but you go back 50 60 70 years ago Americans but folks all over
[15:08.760 --> 15:13.640]  the world were self-sufficient to a great extent and they didn't just can
[15:13.640 --> 15:22.600]  foods everybody in hurricane ravaged zones of the United States everyone for
[15:22.600 --> 15:28.200]  spring and summer storms had a storm shelter and they would every time a
[15:28.200 --> 15:33.280]  storm came in because they didn't have weather warnings every time there was a
[15:33.280 --> 15:38.080]  storm they didn't have meteorologists then who could you know tell them a
[15:38.080 --> 15:42.280]  hurricane just touched down they when they saw a big storm blowing in with
[15:42.280 --> 15:47.960]  big thunderheads a cold front coming into a warm pressure area everybody got
[15:47.960 --> 15:52.960]  the checker set or the chest set and the family went down by kerosene lamp into
[15:52.960 --> 16:02.440]  the storm cellar and waited till the storms blew over now nowadays people if
[16:02.440 --> 16:06.240]  they see storms aren't worried about it unless they go watch TV and then where
[16:06.240 --> 16:10.640]  are they supposed to hide it's just like with the advent of the Texas
[16:10.640 --> 16:16.400]  Instruments calculator in the last 35 years the test scores the arithmetic has
[16:16.400 --> 16:20.440]  plunged and in schools children aren't taught how to do basic math anymore
[16:20.440 --> 16:24.280]  they're taught how to use a calculator well it's the same thing with the great
[16:24.280 --> 16:29.080]  technology of Doppler radar people statistically tend to sit there and wait
[16:29.080 --> 16:32.560]  to be killed sitting in front of the windows in their house when tornadoes
[16:32.560 --> 16:36.920]  are coming because even if they know one's coming they don't have a storm
[16:36.920 --> 16:44.520]  cellar a storm shelter to get into and so that's an example of people in in
[16:44.520 --> 16:51.720]  past generations being self-sufficient being conscious of danger and knowing
[16:51.720 --> 16:55.400]  it's their job to protect themselves take the Mississippi River overflowing
[16:55.400 --> 17:01.680]  and destroying towns and cities as it's done many times in recorded history in
[17:01.680 --> 17:08.040]  the last 350 years or so here in North America what did the self-sufficient
[17:08.040 --> 17:12.120]  farmers do they built their own little dams around their houses and barns and
[17:12.120 --> 17:16.520]  weren't destroyed but the city folk had moved out to the country the trendies
[17:16.520 --> 17:19.920]  and others they didn't know what to do their homes were destroyed so again the
[17:19.920 --> 17:24.800]  government can't and won't and is never able to protect you in a mass scale just
[17:24.800 --> 17:28.000]  like where the mass shooters go to kill people they go to universities they go
[17:28.000 --> 17:31.840]  to public schools where they know no one is armed they go to those gun free
[17:31.840 --> 17:35.760]  zones knowing it's a place where they'll be safe to kill as many people as they
[17:35.760 --> 17:41.000]  want it's all part of this domesticated society and my heart just goes out to all
[17:41.000 --> 17:45.440]  of these women and children and men that have been killed in the reports of
[17:45.440 --> 17:48.600]  women having their three-year-old toddlers torn out of their arms by the
[17:48.600 --> 17:54.240]  wind and being sucked up like Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz and the tornadoes it's
[17:54.240 --> 17:59.440]  just absolutely nightmarish you know I went and saw my kindergarten daughter and
[17:59.440 --> 18:05.360]  my second-grade son their last day of school their their homeschool but they
[18:05.360 --> 18:11.600]  go to a two-day-a-week homeschool slash your type Academy system they're getting
[18:11.600 --> 18:18.040]  more and more popular at a church and they were I went there for their
[18:18.040 --> 18:22.920]  graduation and it was just so touching how these little innocent children's
[18:22.920 --> 18:30.400]  eyes are electrified with discovery and innocence and true beauty and I just
[18:30.400 --> 18:35.280]  thought about this corrupting Hollywood Madison Avenue culture that will take
[18:35.280 --> 18:42.000]  all the basic instincts and programming that is so admirable in the great human

[34:29.960 --> 34:37.520]  in a moment and he talks about a one million person force domestically for

[36:13.800 --> 36:17.280]  to stick their hands down your pants without a specific warrant but they
[36:17.280 --> 36:22.200]  don't care they're just setting the precedent HB 1937 a bill that would
[36:22.200 --> 36:25.920]  have made it a criminal act for security personnel to touch a person's private
[36:25.920 --> 36:31.680]  areas the probable cause is a condition of travel or as a condition of entry into
[36:31.680 --> 36:36.400]  a public place was headed for an imminent Senate vote in Texas having
[36:36.400 --> 36:41.640]  already passed the House unanimously 138 to zero before the federal
[36:41.640 --> 36:45.000]  government stepped in to nix the legislation now remember a federal
[36:45.000 --> 36:49.080]  judges ruled the TSA are now the arbiters of all security you want
[36:49.080 --> 36:54.000]  security at a school prom TSA must be there and that's the plan they will
[36:54.000 --> 36:59.040]  command your local police your local security they they have the magic wand
[36:59.040 --> 37:03.480]  to not to follow any laws and to grope your genitals including Congressman
[37:03.480 --> 37:06.800]  Ron Poles been on having his genitals grope former governor Jesse Vendura
[37:06.800 --> 37:11.720]  genitals grope countless videos of small children with men women sticking their
[37:11.720 --> 37:15.840]  hands down their pants this is again the Nazis just lined you up and got your
[37:15.840 --> 37:21.880]  papers here they're going further to train you to get in your space in a
[37:21.880 --> 37:25.760]  letter to Texas lawmakers including Lieutenant Governor David Dewhurst speaker
[37:25.760 --> 37:32.160]  Joe Strauss the house clerk in the Senate Secretary US Attorney John E. Murphy
[37:32.160 --> 37:37.400]  threatened to cripple the airline industry in the state of legislators did
[37:37.400 --> 37:45.080]  not back down if HR SIC 1937 couldn't even get the bill number right the
[37:45.080 --> 37:49.480]  federal government would likely seek an emergency stay of the statute Murphy
[37:49.480 --> 37:54.960]  wrote unless or until such a stay was granted TSA would likely be required to
[37:54.960 --> 38:00.680]  cancel any flight or series of flights for which it could not ensure the safety
[38:00.680 --> 38:07.040]  of passengers and crew good do it show everybody what tyrants you are shutting
[38:07.040 --> 38:12.160]  down any flights in or out of Texas do it bring it out in the open we're sick
[38:12.160 --> 38:20.560]  of it show us who you are we urge you to consider the ramifications of this bill
[38:20.560 --> 38:24.680]  before casting your vote Murphy added to the fact that Murphy can't even get the
[38:24.680 --> 38:29.400]  name of the bill correct is almost as disconcerting as the rampant mafia like
[38:29.400 --> 38:34.880]  attitude of the DOJ and using a de facto economic terrorism to shoot down
[38:34.880 --> 38:40.880]  the legislation following a fiery debate in the Texas House last night Senate
[38:40.880 --> 38:44.920]  sponsor Dan Patrick Republican of Houston pulled the bill remarking the
[38:44.920 --> 38:50.560]  TSA representatives had been lobbying the Texas Senate in an effort to mothball
[38:50.560 --> 38:55.840]  the legislation I will pull HP 937 down but I will stand for liberty in the
[38:55.840 --> 38:59.620]  state of Texas Patrick said well that's have your cake in it too buddy Patrick
[38:59.620 --> 39:04.320]  out of the TSA officials not servants or other people just our officials are
[39:04.320 --> 39:08.560]  our owners had warned him passing the bill could close down all the airports
[39:08.560 --> 39:12.240]  in Texas which he regarded as a heavy-handed threat by the federal
[39:12.240 --> 39:16.520]  government it's a threat of blockade of war that's what that's that's called
[39:16.520 --> 39:24.600]  siege that's what a blockade is these staff of represented David Simpson said
[39:24.600 --> 39:29.360]  the DOJ had thrown down the gauntlet no kidding in using such a stark language
[39:29.360 --> 39:33.640]  to oppose the bill either Texas backs off and continues to let the government
[39:33.640 --> 39:38.240]  employees fondle innocent women children and men as a condition of travel the
[39:38.240 --> 39:42.000]  staff wrote or the TSA transportation security administration as the authority
[39:42.000 --> 39:49.760]  to cancel flights or a series of flights and it goes on to break down that Texas
[39:49.760 --> 39:53.400]  flights could be shut down because TSA would not be able to ensure the safety
[39:53.400 --> 39:58.920]  of passengers and crew of agents could not touch genitals someone must make a
[39:58.920 --> 40:03.720]  stand against these atrocities of our government agents remember what happened
[40:03.720 --> 40:09.680]  last year the pilots union started suing the pilots started refusing pilots get
[40:09.680 --> 40:15.160]  in there run the aircraft control it a giant missile thousands of times were
[40:15.160 --> 40:20.320]  powerful than a bomb or a gun and but they can't be trusted toilet attendant
[40:20.320 --> 40:25.920]  level minimum wage potbellied untrained goons most of which quit because they
[40:25.920 --> 40:30.880]  won't grow people all day who wants to do that job sickos that's the plan to
[40:30.880 --> 40:34.600]  to to find that army of people that'll do it and turn them loose on the streets
[40:34.600 --> 40:39.360]  that's always been the plan they were there sticking their hands down the
[40:39.360 --> 40:42.880]  stewardess's pants the flight attendants taking their hands down the pilots
[40:42.880 --> 40:46.440]  pants grabbing their genitals on the outside the pilots said we're not doing
[40:46.440 --> 40:52.040]  this they said we can use the aircraft we're trusted with that but but some
[40:52.040 --> 40:57.000]  toilet attendant has got to do this to us I mean this is reality call them out
[40:57.000 --> 41:04.960]  on what they're doing in a point-by-point reputation the DOG letter
[41:04.960 --> 41:09.120]  Simpson compared the battle against the TSA the Texas Revolutionary War against
[41:09.120 --> 41:13.560]  Mexico writing gentlemen we find ourselves at such a watershed moment
[41:13.560 --> 41:17.000]  today the federal government is attempting to deprive the citizens of
[41:17.000 --> 41:20.800]  Texas their constitutional right under the Fourth Amendment of the United
[41:20.800 --> 41:25.120]  States Constitution in Article 1 section 9 of the Texas Constitution it would
[41:25.120 --> 41:29.160]  not stand up for our citizens in the face of this deprivation of their
[41:29.160 --> 41:33.080]  personal rights and dignity who will the fact of the Department of Justice and
[41:33.080 --> 41:37.440]  the TSA have resorted to threats of economic terrorism in addition to
[41:37.440 --> 41:41.920]  underhanded lobbying techniques again illustrates the fact that the federal
[41:41.920 --> 41:45.240]  government is increasingly behaving like a criminal enterprise with total
[41:45.240 --> 41:51.360]  disregard for the Constitution the TSA's initial response to HB 1937 was a
[41:51.360 --> 41:54.160]  claim that it could not become law because it violated Supremacy Clause the
[41:54.160 --> 41:58.520]  US Constitution article 6 clause 2 along the TSA claim prevents states from
[41:58.520 --> 42:02.680]  regulating the federal government why do we even have states then in reality this
[42:02.680 --> 42:07.400]  was a complete fabrication the statement is false ignorance from the TSA
[42:07.400 --> 42:11.640]  is unlikely so I'll call a spade a spade they're lying the Supremacy Clause
[42:11.640 --> 42:15.320]  says nothing of the sort reported Michael Bolden of the Tenth Amendment Center
[42:15.320 --> 42:21.040]  here's the full text ladies and gentlemen read the Fourth Amendment your
[42:21.040 --> 42:27.080]  person papers affects home cannot be touched without a specific warrant which
[42:27.080 --> 42:31.600]  sworn affidavit of what is illegal and the person places and things to be
[42:31.600 --> 42:41.000]  searched we fought a war in 1776 over this in 1836 my ancestors on my dad and
[42:41.000 --> 42:45.600]  my mother's side my mom's family's raised Colonel Travis's children he left
[42:45.600 --> 42:49.440]  with them we went to the Alamo they were coming to Gonzales they were coming
[42:49.440 --> 42:54.720]  to other towns to take the firearms and warrantless searches and the Texans said
[42:54.720 --> 42:59.920]  we are not gonna let you do what King George the Third tried it's on and they
[42:59.920 --> 43:05.440]  ran up flags with images of muskets and cannons and said come and take it and
[43:05.440 --> 43:10.960]  that war started they said that's it it's on you want it come take it and when
[43:10.960 --> 43:15.360]  they came the war started that's how it happens that's what's going on in this
[43:15.360 --> 43:19.480]  society now I'm gonna be breaking this down more when the representative
[43:19.480 --> 43:26.520]  joins us popping in in the next hour there's some good news powerful
[43:26.520 --> 43:31.320]  bipartisan Congress prepares to fight TSA will give you more on that TSA
[43:31.320 --> 43:34.160]  launches groping in high school prom to other public places I mean just
[43:34.160 --> 43:39.080]  completely out of their jurisdiction like mad dogs and it came out last year
[43:39.080 --> 43:43.440]  for over a year Congress said give us the radiation meter reports that under
[43:43.440 --> 43:48.120]  federal law of the radiation emanating from these body scanners TSA said we're
[43:48.120 --> 43:51.880]  not gonna release it Congress finally stood up with their proper governmental
[43:51.880 --> 43:56.480]  power over this rogue agency its rogue under the executive and the big bank
[43:56.480 --> 44:02.280]  corporations that run that the hijackers of this country and they came to them
[44:02.280 --> 44:06.380]  and they said you will release it so what came out last month they issued
[44:06.380 --> 44:12.080]  fake radiation studies the real ones have come out many times what they had
[44:12.080 --> 44:15.200]  previously claimed the radiation levels were they're not even following federal
[44:15.200 --> 44:19.040]  law to do monthly radiation gauging on these to make sure they're calibrated
[44:19.040 --> 44:27.600]  correctly this is a pack of lawless criminals in a huge federal bureaucracy
[44:27.600 --> 44:33.640]  power grab we've had the federal security bureaucracy when there's a backfire
[44:33.640 --> 44:37.720]  remember last year in the parking lot at the Capitol a backfire from a vehicle
[44:37.720 --> 44:43.400]  go into congressman's offices go in another case during votes and order them
[44:43.400 --> 44:47.840]  off the floor and the congressman say I don't care what yours danger as you see
[44:47.840 --> 44:52.120]  I heard something out there I got work to do and they have grabbed them
[44:52.120 --> 44:57.080]  physically and remove them this is this is the same thing that social
[44:57.080 --> 45:01.680]  engineers did 3,000 years ago in China they would come to the Chinese emperors
[45:01.680 --> 45:04.920]  and their wives and say you're so powerful you're a god you've got to stay
[45:04.920 --> 45:08.600]  behind this wall city that was really a prison they'd be tricked into that after
[45:08.600 --> 45:11.760]  a few generations of that they live behind a wall city soon they said we've
[45:11.760 --> 45:15.160]  got to bind your feet where you can't even walk you're too powerful to be able
[45:15.160 --> 45:19.640]  to walk soon you can't feed yourself and to prove that you're not wiping
[45:19.640 --> 45:23.920]  yourself or that you're not feeding yourself you have to never trim your
[45:23.920 --> 45:28.720]  fingernails same thing with the British royalty up until recently and the word
[45:28.720 --> 45:32.400]  is it still done they're not even allowed to wipe their own rear ends if you
[45:32.400 --> 45:35.480]  don't believe me same thing with the Chinese dynasty it's called groom of a
[45:35.480 --> 45:40.400]  stool so pretty soon Congress won't even be able to wipe their own butts for
[45:40.400 --> 45:44.640]  security measures I'm not kidding about this this is what the bureaucracies do in
[45:44.640 --> 45:50.920]  China in England they had groom of the stool in France this is how they operate
[45:50.920 --> 45:54.880]  where the where the bureaucrats must must do this but but it's and you're
[45:54.880 --> 45:59.440]  you're laughing this is not a joke this is how far they'll take it where their
[45:59.440 --> 46:04.480]  feet are bound where they can't walk they live in prisons this is what this is
[46:04.480 --> 46:10.280]  the same government psychology at work here what did they say with Dominique
[46:10.280 --> 46:15.200]  Strauss-Kahn who now looks like is being set up they're now saying they have a
[46:15.200 --> 46:19.640]  law that trying to pass a New York State where all women or workers have to
[46:19.640 --> 46:24.200]  wear a government panic button to be able to be around men because one man
[46:24.200 --> 46:28.680]  might try to grab a woman like Schwarzenegger or Khan reportedly and so
[46:28.680 --> 46:33.440]  all men are rapists and all women must wear panic alarms because somebody
[46:33.440 --> 46:37.960]  might try to rape someday guilty until proven innocent total surveillance in
[46:37.960 --> 46:43.040]  England 22,000 homes every year with first-born children have cameras for
[46:43.040 --> 46:47.800]  months in the house guilty until proven innocent to make sure the parents are
[46:47.800 --> 46:51.640]  doing everything properly meanwhile the state's five times more likely to abuse
[46:51.640 --> 46:56.040]  children than anybody else in Europe and in the US have you pull up the
[46:56.040 --> 47:00.560]  statistics on that just type it in state children in five times the danger in
[47:00.560 --> 47:05.600]  state custody who watches the state who controls them who keeps us safe from this
[47:05.600 --> 47:10.400]  giant nanny state system that seeks to take control of all society I'll be
[47:10.400 --> 47:19.160]  breaking that down more later now here is the biggest news and this shows how
[47:19.160 --> 47:25.320]  there's this continuity of control you have last year 17 million dollars given
[47:25.320 --> 47:32.880]  in one week by Big Agra openly to pass food safety act now the violations the
[47:32.880 --> 47:38.440]  salmonella outbreaks all of it were at big mega agribusiness plants with the
[47:38.440 --> 47:43.800]  concentration camp chickens all caged up all the violations all the outbreaks
[47:43.800 --> 47:48.520]  for them then they come with 17th million dollars in one week during the
[47:48.520 --> 47:52.600]  attempted passage of that bill and it openly was written by them to shut down
[47:52.600 --> 47:57.760]  family farms ranches the free-range chickens all of it and and they were
[47:57.760 --> 48:01.160]  going to be exempt from the new regulations designed to shut down the
[48:01.160 --> 48:06.040]  local farms and ranches so they're going after that Obama has now given
[48:06.040 --> 48:12.720]  thousands upon thousands to McDonald's and Walmart type outfits where they
[48:12.720 --> 48:16.960]  don't have to get the government mandated health care for their mega
[48:16.960 --> 48:21.160]  corporations but your small company has to buy insurance for your employees
[48:21.160 --> 48:25.640]  again unfair trade advantage to shut you down it's like a Nazi Germany if you
[48:25.640 --> 48:28.920]  were a Nazi you'd have to follow any of the rules and your businesses could
[48:28.920 --> 48:33.560]  operate you could have a farm you could have a ranch you could have a factory
[48:33.560 --> 48:39.160]  you you were exempt the Nazi regulations as Mussolini said about his system
[48:39.160 --> 48:43.240]  that Hitler based it on he said fascism should more be properly be called
[48:43.240 --> 48:48.680]  corporatism the merger of the state and corporations for a select few the
[48:48.680 --> 48:53.360]  opposite of free market see the left thinks government's gonna save them the
[48:53.360 --> 48:56.400]  right thinks corporations are all perfect and gonna save them the
[48:56.400 --> 49:00.480]  differences there's mega corporations that finance big government to create
[49:00.480 --> 49:05.480]  government welfare for them taking our tax money and then passing laws to shut
[49:05.480 --> 49:11.760]  down all true local sustainability now let me expand I was telling you about
[49:11.760 --> 49:17.520]  federal blockades telling Texas remember four years ago when the states
[49:17.520 --> 49:20.720]  were rebelling against the real ID act standardized driver's license for
[49:20.720 --> 49:23.800]  everybody under federal control to track you and the Fed said you'll be able to
[49:23.800 --> 49:27.040]  get on a plane if your state doesn't do this with the driver's license you won't
[49:27.040 --> 49:30.920]  be able to go to a national park that's now begun with states that didn't put it
[49:30.920 --> 49:33.840]  in place they're not letting you on planes they're not letting you in
[49:33.840 --> 49:37.280]  national parks now oh we don't accept this state ID now if they're not
[49:37.280 --> 49:44.680]  complying I've got that in the news and they are announcing now DHS merges with
[49:44.680 --> 49:47.680]  Pentagon and NSA under Obama's cyber threat plan
[49:47.680 --> 49:51.520]  Kurt Nemo's headline he's reporting from CBS News it's worse than that I've read
[49:51.520 --> 49:55.920]  the cyber security act sections here on air it isn't merging the Pentagon is
[49:55.920 --> 50:03.680]  already running everything they're already running everything out of Colorado
[50:03.680 --> 50:09.000]  Springs the real side of COG government they are already running the system out
[50:09.000 --> 50:14.320]  of the NORAD underground command bases on record and they admit here that if all
[50:14.320 --> 50:19.320]  private networks all private systems to protect America will have to put in place
[50:19.320 --> 50:24.480]  the federal network systems and what did they announce two weeks ago the

[51:10.040 --> 51:14.120]  hyperinflation that will soon hit the United States and could lead to millions
[51:14.120 --> 51:18.400]  of Americans becoming homeless all caused by the devalued US dollar while

[53:05.360 --> 53:08.800]  storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that in a real meltdown
[53:08.800 --> 53:12.560]  non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold it's true
[53:12.560 --> 53:15.720]  seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country and it's
[53:15.720 --> 53:19.640]  possible that could even happen again so our friends at solutions from science
[53:19.640 --> 53:23.760]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a
[53:23.760 --> 53:28.680]  survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food
[53:28.680 --> 53:32.200]  for you and your family and here's the best part these seeds have not been
[53:32.200 --> 53:36.000]  genetically modified in any way you actually get enough seeds to plant a
[53:36.000 --> 53:40.640]  full acre crisis garden so visit them today at survivalseedbank.com

[53:51.440 --> 53:57.040]  remember in a real crisis non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item this
[53:57.040 --> 54:15.440]  is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com
[54:15.440 --> 54:25.120]  to sum it up simply and succinctly the new world order is government or of and
[54:25.120 --> 54:32.080]  by piratical unelected mafia crime syndicates known as the fortune 100 I
[54:32.080 --> 54:38.480]  mean you can pick any one of the fortune 100 you want a Wells Fargo 378.4
[54:38.480 --> 54:43.920]  billion and laundered drugs the aircraft shipping the drugs leased by them
[54:43.920 --> 54:48.760]  everything and they don't even get in trouble they pay a 0.3% fine on it and
[54:48.760 --> 54:52.360]  I can go right down every one of the corporations and just give you unlimited
[54:52.360 --> 54:57.000]  that they're above the law they don't pay taxes they don't do nothing and then
[54:57.000 --> 55:02.560]  they come in and lobby to raise your taxes because they then take that money
[55:02.560 --> 55:09.600]  offshore in banker bailouts to themselves Monsanto all of them Archer
[55:09.600 --> 55:14.880]  Daniels Midland Tyson all on record Tyson can have hundreds of violations at
[55:14.880 --> 55:18.880]  one plant their competitor has one violation to chicken plant shut down
[55:18.880 --> 55:24.760]  Tyson nothing can stop them this is all about consolidation and I mentioned to
[55:24.760 --> 55:30.000]  you DHS merges with Pentagon and NSA under Obama's cyber security threat I
[55:30.000 --> 55:34.000]  got news for you the DARPA and the Pentagon created the Internet they've
[55:34.000 --> 55:37.920]  already got the whole thing in place the kill switches the control switches
[55:37.920 --> 55:41.080]  even CNN admits it they're just now announcing it because they're going to
[55:41.080 --> 55:46.080]  start using it here CBS News one key aspect oh it's so positive of the plan
[55:46.080 --> 55:51.960]  is to put the DHS mission to protect US federal civilian networks on part with
[55:51.960 --> 55:56.560]  the DoD's mission to protect US military networks giving the DHS more autonomy
[55:56.560 --> 56:00.240]  to act against cyber threats on behalf of the government then before writes
[56:00.240 --> 56:07.360]  Elizabeth Montabeno for the technology publication DHS has also sought to merge
[56:07.360 --> 56:11.840]  the effort with the NSA and various civilian operators and then you read
[56:11.840 --> 56:16.360]  into it it says standardization for the telecommunications systems they already
[56:16.360 --> 56:19.480]  have it they already have the kills which is in all the phones all the major
[56:19.480 --> 56:25.640]  hubs it's all the telecommunications act of 96 now phased in put into place and
[56:25.640 --> 56:33.360]  the whole article breaks this down so just total control now internationally
[56:33.360 --> 56:36.800]  the same things being announced internationally the same global
[56:36.800 --> 56:40.280]  standardization just like they have naked body scanners going in all over
[56:40.280 --> 56:44.360]  Europe very same systems very same companies very same procedures it's
[56:44.360 --> 56:48.120]  continuity of agendas same thing in Australia same carbon taxes being put
[56:48.120 --> 56:54.800]  in same ban on phosphorescent light bulbs it's all about that they have global
[56:54.800 --> 56:58.640]  control corporations come in and lobby government passes laws you've got to buy
[56:58.640 --> 57:03.640]  their products GE takes control the winehouse economic board shuts down
[57:03.640 --> 57:07.840]  their competition and coal powered plants there stay open and get waivers to
[57:07.840 --> 57:12.240]  operate as dirty as they want just like Obama's people get waivers on healthcare
[57:12.240 --> 57:20.200]  I mean you name it pure mafia naked out in the open here it is AFP French news
[57:20.200 --> 57:24.880]  agency key internet summit to discuss online rules global rules what are they
[57:24.880 --> 57:29.880]  calling for government without any order any court be able to shut down sites for
[57:29.880 --> 57:34.560]  copyright speech whatever they want YouTube in Europe and England already
[57:34.560 --> 57:38.200]  putting up the message this video removed because of government request it's
[57:38.200 --> 57:44.160]  already starting in the US AP internet rules at center of g8 forum in Paris
[57:44.160 --> 57:51.200]  they're all there the bureaucracy not the parliaments not the Congress and you
[57:51.200 --> 57:55.840]  read the article what are they calling for Sarkozy web initiative faces
[57:55.840 --> 57:59.720]  reality check so he's the extreme guy saying total control they're going no
[57:59.720 --> 58:04.960]  only partial Sarkozy and it goes on Sarkozy who's notorious among techies
[58:04.960 --> 58:08.200]  for creating a law that calls for copyright pirates to be cut off the
[58:08.200 --> 58:11.720]  internet period and that means an internet ID that the Obama's announced
[58:11.720 --> 58:16.080]  that lauded the gathering of executives that included Google links Eric Schmidt
[58:16.080 --> 58:21.000]  and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg for helping fuel the Arab Spring and spring
[58:21.000 --> 58:25.800]  economic growth the new CIA fake uprisings now they've kicked the old
[58:25.800 --> 58:30.240]  dictator out now they're gonna charge him mubarak and the country's even worse
[58:30.240 --> 58:35.440]  just what they wanted here's another one dealing with it White House hires a

[01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:12.280]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:19.840]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas
[01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:23.400]  Alex Jones
[01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:32.520]  representative Cynthia McKinney last time we talked to her last night here the
[01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:39.320]  bombs going off she is scheduled to be joining us coming up in about an hour and
[01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:46.160]  a half from now state representative here in Texas David Simpson scheduled to
[01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:51.200]  be on with us what the next segment Sharon should be he's on the house floor
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:55.240]  right now you know it's the end of session so it's a madhouse there if you
[01:00:55.240 --> 01:01:01.320]  just joined us incredible news federal blockade TSA holds Texas flights hostage
[01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:04.680]  we're gonna be talking about that with the state rep coming up here in a moment
[01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:12.600]  but look here's another headline from natural news dealing with the fact that
[01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:20.600]  all over the world now we have speculators going in and driving up the
[01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:25.880]  price of food because the big banks and and and brokerage firms are buying up
[01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:32.720]  farmland they're jacking up the prices of food because they're speculating in it
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:37.680]  because we're in a world economic crisis not just the United States but the
[01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:42.440]  European central banks the Asian central banks through the G20 publicly in the
[01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:49.280]  last decade have had coordinated currency devaluations and so all over the
[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:55.400]  world whether it's euros or dollars they have lost purchasing power the dollar
[01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:59.960]  more than the euro and that's one of the main reasons that our entire global
[01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:06.480]  system is in crisis is because all commodities from oil to cooking oil to
[01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:15.080]  rice to corn wheat they're all going up and on top of that big agribusiness have
[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:20.000]  positioned themselves and it's the official policy of the Department of
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:24.200]  Agriculture they say get bigger get out they don't want little micro farms they
[01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:29.400]  don't want little small family farms because that's not a chain where they
[01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:33.720]  can control the entire market and jack-up prices and so that's why big
[01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:38.120]  agribusiness openly lobbies for regulations to shut down family farms
[01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:41.960]  and ranches that's why the Amish are being swat team for selling legal raw
[01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:46.680]  milk that's why people are being arrested selling tomatoes and peaches on the
[01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:52.680]  side of the highway that's why organic food stores we see the surveillance video
[01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:57.240]  where cops bust in with guns and put everybody on the ground so they can go
[01:02:57.240 --> 01:03:01.160]  to the jury and make it look like they're criminals there is massive amounts of
[01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:06.240]  money being spent to try to keep people from getting off the grid because the
[01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:10.360]  system's scared they know that ten years ago you couldn't find organic food on
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:16.520]  US store shelves but now even mainline grocery stores more than half the food
[01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:21.560]  is certified organic because people are choosing it you can hardly find non
[01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:30.040]  organic hormone GMO free clone free milk now because people will not buy the
[01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:34.600]  other stuff so the system is panicking they see the movement to get off the
[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:37.920]  grid they see the movement for people to leave the big mega cities and the
[01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:43.240]  crumbling inner cities and move to farms and to start becoming self-sufficient
[01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:47.360]  they see the co-ops and communities forming and so all over the country the
[01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:50.240]  federal government's coming into the states are giving them billions of
[01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:56.000]  dollars to set up task forces to go out and harass people they tried to pass a
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:00.880]  law last year where you couldn't go out to your date tree or go out to your fig
[01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:07.480]  tree and pick them and then make jelly preserves and and and sell it on the on
[01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:12.000]  the corner or even give it to your neighbors they are even without the law
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.600]  passing swat teaming and harassing and acting like all of this is illegal
[01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:21.400]  because they see the massive movement away from it and so now the huge drug
[01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:28.840]  war anti-drug war paramilitary police forces in the US are being turned
[01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:35.240]  against the farms the ranches the truly local sustainable communities at the
[01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:42.080]  same time the power structure is creating artificial fake environmental
[01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:47.360]  movements which actually seek to keep you on the grid within their systems
[01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:51.280]  we're gonna break more of that down coming up later but America is being
[01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:56.400]  transformed to a system for all we have is prisons walmarts and military bases
[01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:59.440]  with security thugs on every street corner sticking their hands down our
[01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:03.680]  fans this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:08.040]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:12.200]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:16.240]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:20.120]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:24.240]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:28.560]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:32.880]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:36.560]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:40.760]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of

[01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:10.000]  Ventura former governor is suing they they have done things I can't even say
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:13.800]  on air when I've been with him flying commercial working on his TV show with
[01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:18.240]  him and the good news is at the federal level powerful bipartisan caucus
[01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:23.720]  prepares to fight TSA strip their naked body scanner funding other incredible
[01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:26.520]  news but before we go to the state repelling out a few minutes with him
[01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:31.040]  here's Obama but again this started with Bush but here's Obama saying a
[01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:36.040]  domestic security force just as big and just as strong as our military with the
[01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:40.280]  TSA now saying they're gonna be at high school proms fondling your daughters and
[01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:46.120]  sons here it is we cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to
[01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:50.240]  achieve the national security objectives that we've set we've got to have a
[01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:56.040]  civilian national security force that's just as powerful just as strong just as
[01:09:56.040 --> 01:10:02.240]  well funded show representative do you agree that this is a total federal
[01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:06.800]  power grab now that they're announcing TSA has total jurisdiction over every
[01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:10.960]  grocery store every public school every state house they will do what they want
[01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:17.960]  when they want or all transportation will be blockaded I don't know that
[01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:22.360]  firsthand but I can tell you you know they're not just aiming at airports they
[01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:29.640]  went to that prom in New Mexico they've gone to train stations I read a contract
[01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:33.200]  where they were seeking to develop the scanners where they could scan people on
[01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:38.480]  sidewalk moving objects and a public event such as a football game basically
[01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:43.480]  virtually strip searching people without public calls without expressed
[01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:51.640]  informed consent it's outrageous and we we need to rein the government in we
[01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:58.200]  fought our first war for independence to protect our property our freedom our
[01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:03.160]  privacy the Stamp Act wasn't just about taxation without representation it was
[01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:07.080]  about a British officer standing at the door of your house writing his own
[01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:10.960]  search warrant to enter in and to go through every cotton-picking thing you
[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:15.720]  have to see if the King's stamp on it is on it and that's why we have the Fourth
[01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:21.000]  Amendment the Fourth Amendment is a minimal standard the Supreme Court's
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:25.720]  rules and its rules that the state can improve upon that define it and that's
[01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:32.920]  what my house bill 1937 was designed to do basically to say you know you've got
[01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:38.440]  to have probable cause before you make touching my private to the condition of
[01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:49.200]  flying an airplane representative David Simpson House District 7 your family
[01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:54.680]  has been violated by these people much of my family has we can't even travel
[01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:58.760]  anymore because I physically cannot put up with it and when they tried with my
[01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:07.360]  family I did blow up and cause quite a scene and almost got arrested I I mean
[01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:10.200]  this is the line of the sand I just can't have people sticking their hands
[01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:14.560]  down my three-year-old daughter's pants and I know they went down that road with
[01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:20.080]  your family can you break down the sense of the house right now with this
[01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:25.640]  threat by the US Attorney to blockade air travel in and out of the state of
[01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:30.440]  Texas well what happened was it passed my bill passed out of the house
[01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:38.480]  unanimously and it had almost a hundred signature hundred co-authors had 94 then
[01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:42.240]  it went to the Senate had passed unanimously out of transportation
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:46.560]  homeland security and then when it was brought to the floor but on a 10th
[01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:51.200]  calendar a senator Dan Patrick was doing a good job and they was ready to bring
[01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:56.360]  the bill up but if the bill was delayed delayed delayed and apparently so that
[01:12:56.360 --> 01:13:00.840]  the Department of Justice letter could be circulated among the members and some
[01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:09.480]  of the members scattered and like a cubby of quail and I had a response
[01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:13.320]  written that I didn't have time to get that to the senators there's much
[01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:18.800]  misinformation and falsehood and that letter we were not saying to stop all
[01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:23.840]  searches we're saying that the searches without probable cause must stop at
[01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:27.920]  touching our private that you've got to have probable cause the people got to be
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:33.320]  there or a body cavity and so I had the other thing is we put a provision in the
[01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:38.640]  bill not to fight federalism this is really a nullification bill this is an
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:42.480]  interposition bill it says you know instead of threatening to shut down our
[01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:47.600]  flight why didn't they just show us the statutory authority to growth and ogle
[01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:52.560]  our private part I don't think there is such a law and I dare them to pass such
[01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:57.160]  a law I was about to say they claim they have a regulation I've looked and I've
[01:13:57.160 --> 01:14:03.440]  had constitutional law scholars on it doesn't exist an FBI agent can't go to
[01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:06.880]  public parks or a shopping mall and stick their hands down people's pants and
[01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:10.720]  folks would laugh if they tried but in the airport they've incrementally
[01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:15.800]  rationed it up and and and now this federal judge says it's your right to be
[01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:21.600]  groped properly so we're gonna send our professional TSA out to your school
[01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:25.760]  prompts at the county level to stick their hands down your pants and they
[01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:30.640]  say you have a right to not be profiled so all of you have a right to have your
[01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:34.640]  fourth amendment violated I mean it's sickening lawyer tricks that they're
[01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:43.080]  trying here yes that's right and I'm afraid we're losing the Texas but Sam
[01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:49.880]  Houston fought for and govern he said Texas is just a learned submission to
[01:14:49.880 --> 01:14:55.080]  any oppression come from what source it may and if we don't stand up now we're
[01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:59.000]  going to lose our independence we're going to lose our sovereignty we're
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:05.120]  going to lose our rights as individuals to live free and with dignity and to
[01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:12.040]  travel freely it's just we've moved from proof caution to ridiculous success
[01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:17.000]  well you're absolutely right where do you where do you go from here a state
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:23.120]  representative David Simpson from the House District 7 a true hero of liberty
[01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:28.480]  and and and doing his duty standing up against this tyranny and he suffered at
[01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:33.600]  the hands of these tyrants as wife and children he where do we go from here with
[01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:38.200]  this outrage because now there's no end I mean if they can and they know this if
[01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:45.240]  they can federally seize areas outside of law always more more more first on the
[01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:49.040]  outside of the pants now in the pants where does it end how do we meet these
[01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:56.320]  people well we try to have some cuts and then just not not submit to it and then
[01:15:56.320 --> 01:16:00.600]  tell them to show us the law and then even if there is a law then we need to
[01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:05.080]  throw those rascals out who would ever pass such a law and there's no law that
[01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:10.320]  Congress has that's how the bill is written and if that were on were to be
[01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:15.440]  written I think it'd be found unconstitutional one thing if this bill is not absolutely
[01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:21.120]  dead yet it was withdrawn when several people cowarded in light of this this
[01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:27.040]  federal threat but if they can call the governor or the lieutenant governor and
[01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:33.520]  the and the senators they still it could be passed that even this day so it
[01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:37.000]  doesn't matter that you had unanimous in the House you are our representatives
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:42.240]  and we went back before the 17th Amendment you could recall US senators to
[01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:47.200]  the legislature but that's been taken this is just so incredible in closing
[01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:50.600]  sir and we're gonna pull up the number for the Texas Senate do you happen to
[01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:54.840]  have it off the top of your head because we would give out that general
[01:16:54.840 --> 01:17:01.960]  legislative switchboard number for folks to call the Senate well we'll get it up
[01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:06.000]  on screen after you leave us here in just a few minutes but going through your
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:10.920]  letter that's up on your state rep website now you talk about this being
[01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:16.360]  throwing down the gauntlet and liken it to the Texas war in 1836 against the
[01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:21.800]  tyrant Santa Anna who the Mexicans later over through themselves expand on why
[01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:28.720]  this is such hardcore tyranny well this is this is Gonzalez a hundred seventy
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:33.720]  five years ago if you remember when our forefathers were settling Texas
[01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:38.040]  peacefully and working with the Mexican government under the Constitution of
[01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:44.000]  1824 they gave us a cannon in Gonzalez to protect ourselves from the terrorists
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:52.640]  then the Indians and when they came to take that cannon they said you know come
[01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:57.680]  and take it and they turned it on them and they fought for independence I like
[01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:02.080]  to wear there's another flag besides because the come and take it moment and
[01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:06.640]  I hope the governor I hope the lieutenant governor I hope our senators will
[01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:11.320]  stand up and see this this is not an assault on federalism this is saying
[01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:17.880]  just leave us alone don't treat a traveler as a criminal suspect you know
[01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:22.320]  it's like going into a department store or taking every customer going into a
[01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:27.360]  department store and groping them and searching them on the way out if someone
[01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:30.960]  puts something in a backpack and tries to leave without paying for it certainly
[01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:36.040]  talk to them question them search them and not every customer well listen when
[01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:39.960]  people are seen on camera cramming jewelry down their pants there's been
[01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:45.240]  many court cases as you know covering this they have to call the police the
[01:18:45.240 --> 01:18:48.720]  cops have to have probable cause they then take them to the jail and then
[01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:53.040]  they are searched there by someone of their own sex I mean that's why state
[01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:57.440]  police are on record FBI is no one's ever done this this is is there any doubt
[01:18:57.440 --> 01:19:02.120]  in your mind representative that this is a giant power grab now I think it is and
[01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:07.000]  the PSA agents are doing what peace officers cannot do without probable
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:16.000]  cause but it's time that we stand up and that we really refuse to fly if they're
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:23.520]  gonna take our daughters and condom we we've got to stand up for freedom for
[01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:31.080]  dignity or the terrorists that want that we are doing more than the terrorist
[01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:37.600]  ever dreamed they could do 60,000 people a day out of two million are getting
[01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:45.160]  virtually strict search or a growth over growth well representative will

[01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:20.880]  down people's pants that's a felony on the outside it's a misdemeanor and I've
[01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:25.240]  had them on I've had the district attorney for San Francisco on saying if he
[01:26:25.240 --> 01:26:29.360]  sees it he's gonna arrest them and it it scared the TSA they've backed off in
[01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:32.840]  many airports with the hands down the pants and on the outside and the
[01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:38.480]  groping of the breast this is all psychological warfare nothing to do with
[01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:43.240]  security the terror is all-stage ladies and gentlemen and even if it was real I
[01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:47.120]  want to face the danger instead of the greater danger of a federal government
[01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:53.320]  that has absolutely unlimited uncontrolled power and that's how the war
[01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:56.840]  started was the Stamp Act is that they would go and search your house without a
[01:26:56.840 --> 01:27:00.120]  warrant they would well because English law said you had to have a warrant they
[01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:05.800]  would write up crackerjack box warrants and by that they had as much
[01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:10.280]  legitimacy as a dollar bill a fake dollar bill you get out of a crackerjack box
[01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:17.560]  that's got bugs bunny on it or something now here's the deal I want to

[01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:30.200]  ones in and they're putting al Qaeda affiliated groups in to and then in a

[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:29.160]  blockade you an act of siege I mean why do we even have states the public
[01:35:29.160 --> 01:35:32.400]  school children and college students are taught there is no 10th amendment there
[01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:36.600]  is no 9th amendment well then why are they there clearly the feds have no

[01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:03.400]  thing as a state government and if you say that state governments ever existed
[01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:09.880]  you're a conspiracy theorist what happens then if a dictator ever got into
[01:36:09.880 --> 01:36:13.120]  the federal government what happens if a foreign power came and bought off the
[01:36:13.120 --> 01:36:16.440]  government which happened a lot in Europe it's why we have our system to
[01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:20.440]  stop that what would we do to stop it well we would fall down and worship the

[01:54:20.120 --> 01:54:24.800]  alright i'm gonna go to your phone calls and get a bunch of other news but think
[01:54:24.800 --> 01:54:30.120]  about the fact that some might even see it as radical for our state to vote
[01:54:30.120 --> 01:54:35.040]  unanimously to tell the feds we've passed a law there's already laws and they
[01:54:35.040 --> 01:54:38.480]  can't do it a cop can't stick their hand on your pants without probable cause
[01:54:38.480 --> 01:54:41.960]  they've got to just start enforcing the laws that are already there I've had
[01:54:41.960 --> 01:54:44.680]  district attorneys on but the point is they're doing something illegal
[01:54:44.680 --> 01:54:48.880]  unconstitutional out of their jurisdiction and for myself to get up
[01:54:48.880 --> 01:54:51.720]  here and try to call numbers at the state house and nobody answers the phone
[01:54:51.720 --> 01:54:55.600]  at multiple numbers and I say well I'll just go down there and talk to them
[01:54:55.600 --> 01:55:01.800]  people like wow he's gonna go talk to his representative how incredibly evil
[01:55:01.800 --> 01:55:06.600]  you watch media some media will say that it doesn't matter it lets the system
[01:55:06.600 --> 01:55:11.880]  know it's over it's over our state unanimously votes to do this in the
[01:55:11.880 --> 01:55:15.080]  house the Senate reportedly had a unanimous vote lined up because none of
[01:55:15.080 --> 01:55:18.240]  these guys want to be on record for this groping they know the polls are 98%
[01:55:18.240 --> 01:55:23.800]  against it people are like what you're checking in babies diapers and no one
[01:55:23.800 --> 01:55:26.640]  the feds they'll probably soon stick a bomb in a baby's diaper these are such
[01:55:26.640 --> 01:55:31.960]  criminals and they've been caught over and over doing it so something else you
[01:55:31.960 --> 01:55:35.040]  can do is we could get all the 18 wheeler drivers that are listening or
[01:55:35.040 --> 01:55:39.000]  dump truck drivers or whatever to get in there and drive around the Capitol in
[01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:42.320]  circles honking their horns to get their attention that's been done in other
[01:55:42.320 --> 01:55:46.620]  state houses or you know when you first arrive you can do that just to get the
[01:55:46.620 --> 01:55:50.560]  buzz going but the most important thing to do is call the media and don't wait
[01:55:50.560 --> 01:55:54.880]  start going down there right now and just go in you're a tourist they've got
[01:55:54.880 --> 01:56:00.840]  little metal detectors now it's a free society and you'll go through and if
[01:56:00.840 --> 01:56:04.080]  the stormtroopers ask you what are you here for slave because you know that's
[01:56:04.080 --> 01:56:09.720]  the new America you say I'm going to see my representatives who that's evil
[01:56:09.720 --> 01:56:13.720]  don't do that we got the federal boys in there telling them now it works right
[01:56:13.720 --> 01:56:18.320]  now of course that won't happen or let that happen everybody bring video
[01:56:18.320 --> 01:56:22.240]  cameras it's your state house it's your house you paid for it with your tax
[01:56:22.240 --> 01:56:28.280]  money and it's time legislatively to run the feds out of this state every other

[02:00:30.520 --> 02:00:38.520]  welcome yeah hi Alex these this whole thing with the pat downs at the airport
[02:00:38.520 --> 02:00:45.360]  martial law in slow motion I believe that it's it's a way to bring in biometric
[02:00:45.360 --> 02:00:50.360]  cards because they know that the people will resist this they've already said
[02:00:50.360 --> 02:00:54.160]  that they're gonna now give you a biometric card but grope on top of that
[02:00:54.160 --> 02:00:59.000]  just not hands on the pants if you have the biometric federal card now I have
[02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:04.800]  I listened to a on C-span last week John McCain was complaining about the
[02:01:04.800 --> 02:01:09.800]  pat downs to Janet Apolitano and in it she talks about bringing out these
[02:01:09.800 --> 02:01:13.200]  biometric car she said that and you're gonna have to have it to have a job work
[02:01:13.200 --> 02:01:16.040]  they already make the unions do it to get health care you'll go through a
[02:01:16.040 --> 02:01:19.920]  terror database there'll be a no-gun buy on it because it's now a security
[02:01:19.920 --> 02:01:23.760]  assessment and that's how outside of law you know no in fact that was announced
[02:01:23.760 --> 02:01:27.720]  last week you're absolutely correct now I had a clip would you like to hear it's
[02:01:27.720 --> 02:01:33.120]  real quick and I saw the AP but I go ahead and play the clip okay I understand
[02:01:33.120 --> 02:01:39.640]  them as well and I received them as well three things one we are investing in
[02:01:39.640 --> 02:01:46.400]  research and technology the research cycle is is not an immediate cycle but
[02:01:46.400 --> 02:01:50.600]  we are we are investing working with national labs and others on better
[02:01:50.600 --> 02:01:58.120]  technology to I've asked and TSA is moving to a more risk-based approach to
[02:01:58.120 --> 02:02:03.760]  how we screen part of that will lead to what my third point is which is we want
[02:02:03.760 --> 02:02:09.480]  to enlarge trusted travel type programs where we have a biometric card people
[02:02:09.480 --> 02:02:14.400]  have it they can go through sort of what we use for pilots now anyway and we're
[02:02:14.400 --> 02:02:18.680]  looking for ways to scale that up and by the way that's always been the plan
[02:02:18.680 --> 02:02:22.880]  since Ridge announced it almost nine years ago and I put that in my films for
[02:02:22.880 --> 02:02:25.720]  folks that are doubting they're gonna keep all of it you're gonna get the
[02:02:25.720 --> 02:02:30.280]  card and then they're gonna have groping on top of it just so you know now one
[02:02:30.280 --> 02:02:35.760]  other clip that I I took off the 60 minutes interview with Tom Drake who's
[02:02:35.760 --> 02:02:40.920]  being prosecuted under the espionage act we're basically 60 minutes just
[02:02:40.920 --> 02:02:46.120]  reported that wire warrantless wiretapping is okay and that the order
[02:02:46.120 --> 02:02:50.320]  came directly from the White House and anybody that reports a leak exposing
[02:02:50.320 --> 02:02:54.640]  criminal activity of government is gonna be charged with espionage espionage is
[02:02:54.640 --> 02:02:59.400]  now reporting on the fact that they're criminals right would you like to hear
[02:02:59.400 --> 02:03:05.560]  this clip real quick or go ahead and his frustration group Drake says that he was
[02:03:05.560 --> 02:03:10.000]  shocked to learn about something else that was happening at the agency post
[02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:16.920]  9-11 he learned of a top-secret NSA program that became known as warrantless
[02:03:16.920 --> 02:03:23.800]  wiretapping it was no longer necessary to follow the law these Pandora's box had
[02:03:23.800 --> 02:03:30.040]  opened up orders from the White House the NSA was listening in on people in the
[02:03:30.040 --> 02:03:36.040]  United States without a warrant from a judge and this is where I began to have
[02:03:36.040 --> 02:03:40.280]  great concerns about the decisions that were made to buy past the Constitution
[02:03:40.280 --> 02:03:47.040]  willfully and openly as a result of 9-11 I took my great concerns up with the
[02:03:47.040 --> 02:03:52.400]  dental council and say and now he gets to go to prison you don't expose their
[02:03:52.400 --> 02:03:56.520]  felonies yeah no it's a folks when I don't just say these are criminals and
[02:03:56.520 --> 02:04:00.640]  see a lot of state reps are waking up to this now going what you just groped my

[02:07:33.080 --> 02:07:36.920]  on its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the
[02:07:36.920 --> 02:07:40.800]  arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who
[02:07:40.800 --> 02:07:44.680]  do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care right now in
[02:07:44.680 --> 02:07:50.680]  Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic yet your copy of fall of the
[02:07:50.680 --> 02:07:56.600]  Republic on DVD at info wars.com we're watching online right now in super high
[02:07:56.600 --> 02:08:00.840]  quality at prisonplanet.tv
[02:08:00.840 --> 02:08:08.920]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[02:08:09.920 --> 02:08:16.080]  all right I'm going to your phone calls he's just joined me it is the 25th day
[02:08:16.080 --> 02:08:24.120]  of May 2011 and it is 108 central standard time in 20 seconds now it'll
[02:08:24.120 --> 02:08:29.360]  take me 5-10 minutes to get my crew all loaded up with cameras and equipment in
[02:08:29.360 --> 02:08:33.880]  about an hour but by 2 30 I should have found a parking space around there and
[02:08:33.880 --> 02:08:38.840]  made my way to one of the entrances of the Capitol and then I'll go through the
[02:08:38.840 --> 02:08:42.120]  new security that they put in because anytime anything happens they got to
[02:08:42.120 --> 02:08:45.240]  add more security they said because of Dominic Strauss-Con New York trying to
[02:08:45.240 --> 02:08:48.760]  pass a law that all women and men that work in hotels or any other service
[02:08:48.760 --> 02:08:52.640]  thing have to wear an emergency button to the cops because all men are rapist
[02:08:52.640 --> 02:08:56.240]  I mean it's guilty until proven innocent and I guess there's ever a car wreck on a
[02:08:56.240 --> 02:09:00.040]  highway close the close the highway forever or there's ever a tornado in an
[02:09:00.040 --> 02:09:03.320]  area don't let you ever build there again that's what FEMA already does oh
[02:09:03.320 --> 02:09:07.360]  there was a there's a flood here every hundred years on average you can't build
[02:09:07.360 --> 02:09:12.480]  you have to buy your insurance from the feds now the FEMA insurance I mean again
[02:09:12.480 --> 02:09:19.720]  it's power grabs has nothing to do with your safety now we're gonna go down there
[02:09:19.720 --> 02:09:25.240]  we're gonna talk to those Texas state senators calling on everybody and on your
[02:09:25.240 --> 02:09:29.800]  way call at least one radio or TV station tell them to come out and it's
[02:09:29.800 --> 02:09:35.680]  important this is big I talked to the state rep as we went to break you heard
[02:09:35.680 --> 02:09:38.520]  him on at the beginning of the last hour represented David Simpson district
[02:09:38.520 --> 02:09:43.760]  seven and this is the last day of the session they'll be going probably till
[02:09:43.760 --> 02:09:46.880]  midnight they'll probably announce a new session so we need to make a big deal
[02:09:46.880 --> 02:09:50.120]  that going into the new session if they don't pass it today and he said he was
[02:09:50.120 --> 02:09:54.480]  going back on the floor he's on the floor right now repudiating the lies and
[02:09:54.480 --> 02:09:57.880]  he said this is the line in the sand the gauntlet's been thrown down his family's
[02:09:57.880 --> 02:10:01.640]  been grubbed mr. America they went in the pants and grabbed the genitals with
[02:10:01.640 --> 02:10:05.120]  those filthy gloves they don't change they make you take your shoes off walk
[02:10:05.120 --> 02:10:08.720]  through all the athletes foot folks I only got a few cases athletes foot and
[02:10:08.720 --> 02:10:14.000]  in in playing football and I got a few cases on swim team I was on swim team
[02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:20.520]  till I was about 14 and I hate it I don't ever got it was in places where
[02:10:20.520 --> 02:10:24.720]  people are walking around on wet floors and didn't have it all the way through
[02:10:24.720 --> 02:10:28.280]  because when I worked out at gyms I would you'll go home and take a shower I
[02:10:28.280 --> 02:10:34.120]  didn't like being in the showers you know I'd like to go home and now though
[02:10:34.120 --> 02:10:39.040]  when I fly every time even though I change socks twice a day I like to take
[02:10:39.040 --> 02:10:42.640]  two showers I mean I'm a clean freak I like to scrub with soap all over I enjoy
[02:10:42.640 --> 02:10:46.960]  it now I get athletes foot all the time now and it's it's every time I walk
[02:10:46.960 --> 02:10:50.120]  through LAX or whatever I have to walk through where five thousand people walk
[02:10:50.120 --> 02:10:53.360]  through some filthy floor with every horrible bacteria and fungus you can
[02:10:53.360 --> 02:10:57.560]  imagine and I put my shoes back on I'm on a four five hour flight drive home
[02:10:57.560 --> 02:11:01.360]  take my shoes off and if I don't take a shower that night because it's midnight
[02:11:01.360 --> 02:11:05.320]  I'm exhausted and I get in bed with my feet I have athletes foot the next
[02:11:05.320 --> 02:11:08.760]  morning so now even if I get home at two in the morning sometimes from a
[02:11:08.760 --> 02:11:12.680]  flight so I'd like to not be gone long so I'll end up leaving you know late at
[02:11:12.680 --> 02:11:15.280]  night coming back a few days later late at night so I can have the next day on
[02:11:15.280 --> 02:11:18.280]  air I've got it didn't matter if I get home at two o'clock in the morning while
[02:11:18.280 --> 02:11:21.800]  feel like what are you doing I'm like I gotta take a bath I gotta take a shower
[02:11:21.800 --> 02:11:28.720]  I got desin X putting it in my shoes side issue the point here is that it's
[02:11:28.720 --> 02:11:35.160]  unsanitary it's evil it's wrong and it's got to stop and hey they threaten to
[02:11:35.160 --> 02:11:39.480]  sue in Denver over the violating state law body scanning people under 18 is
[02:11:39.480 --> 02:11:43.600]  child porn they had to stop that they're gonna you heard the state rep
[02:11:43.600 --> 02:11:48.080]  they're gonna put them on highways roads proms TSA is gonna be everywhere and
[02:11:48.080 --> 02:11:51.480]  they don't care they don't have a law they don't have a jurisdiction they're
[02:11:51.480 --> 02:11:58.440]  lawless and I just had the idea instantly on air later in the last
[02:11:58.440 --> 02:12:04.680]  third of the last hour that we're trying to call the main number the Senate
[02:12:04.680 --> 02:12:11.960]  number 512 463 0350 and it just goes to voicemail that's cuz a lot of folks are
[02:12:11.960 --> 02:12:16.480]  calling but regardless you know it's not enough to call these people and when
[02:12:16.480 --> 02:12:23.000]  you go it's your house it's your capital be be proud of yourself because it's
[02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:26.200]  all about this culture of intimidation and when and when government
[02:12:26.200 --> 02:12:29.520]  intimidates you and cops act weird and bug their eyes out at you they start
[02:12:29.520 --> 02:12:36.400]  thinking it's their right to do it because you cower you ever had employees
[02:12:36.400 --> 02:12:41.600]  we're over time or children or anything else for that matter or a girlfriend or
[02:12:41.600 --> 02:12:46.560]  boyfriend where you're too nice and then the roles get all scrambled and then
[02:12:46.560 --> 02:12:50.720]  and then pretty soon no matter what you do they're not happy well it's that way
[02:12:50.720 --> 02:12:55.000]  with government and when you grovel to them when you bow down to them you
[02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:58.640]  become a third-world country you become a North Korea you become a Mexico and
[02:12:58.640 --> 02:13:02.800]  Texas has never bowed to this type of tyranny and we're not gonna bow now and
[02:13:02.800 --> 02:13:07.680]  Texans if we're on after the Civil War to governments northern installed
[02:13:07.680 --> 02:13:11.360]  governments one of the main reasons reconstruction ended a decade later out
[02:13:11.360 --> 02:13:13.840]  of that building right down the street from me now we're not going down there
[02:13:13.840 --> 02:13:17.560]  to run them out because that's not a northern installed government we have
[02:13:17.560 --> 02:13:23.440]  the globalist banker controlled corporate district of Columbia coming into
[02:13:23.440 --> 02:13:28.960]  our good Texas legislature they're out there they're one of the best you
[02:13:28.960 --> 02:13:32.640]  ought to read that Constitution Texas has got it's better than the federal one
[02:13:32.640 --> 02:13:39.680]  and that they unanimously voted I have the unanimous vote here 138 to 0 in
[02:13:39.680 --> 02:13:44.000]  three votes to tell the feds we're gonna enforce existing law we're gonna
[02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:48.800]  arrest you or the state police to arrest you if you stick your hands down
[02:13:48.800 --> 02:13:54.080]  people's pants without probable cause if you grub them and the other way to go
[02:13:54.080 --> 02:13:57.040]  after Ms. Violate state and federal law and radiology they're admittedly
[02:13:57.040 --> 02:14:02.120]  violating that there's more than one way to skin a cat so we'll move in that
[02:14:02.120 --> 02:14:05.480]  direction as well it's the it's resistance is victory continuing to
[02:14:05.480 --> 02:14:12.040]  resist continuing to speak out to say no no no no no so it's a good capital it's
[02:14:12.040 --> 02:14:16.800]  good people okay we need to have that psychology these are people that voted
[02:14:16.800 --> 02:14:21.720]  unanimously the Senate was reportedly two days ago they had they the media
[02:14:21.720 --> 02:14:25.800]  had pulled the 37 members what do we have 28 30 I forget look up number of
[02:14:25.800 --> 02:14:31.120]  Texas state senators I forget and they were unanimous vote well the feds came
[02:14:31.120 --> 02:14:36.760]  in they said we're gonna blockade well shut down the air travel come on the
[02:14:36.760 --> 02:14:40.000]  air the pilot said last year we're not gonna fly anymore this continues their
[02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:43.480]  union did they said okay we're not gonna stick our hands down your pants call
[02:14:43.480 --> 02:14:47.320]  their bluff call their bluff call their bluff call their bluff and they say well
[02:14:47.320 --> 02:14:50.640]  you can't trust pilots they might be crazy how is having somebody sticking the
[02:14:50.640 --> 02:14:54.320]  hand down their pants gonna prove that how is groping a stewardess gonna do
[02:14:54.320 --> 02:14:58.960]  that how do you protect from the TSA people nobody's safe nothing safe in
[02:14:58.960 --> 02:15:02.800]  this world not driving your car not living in Kansas or Texas with tornadoes
[02:15:02.800 --> 02:15:06.640]  not swimming in a swimming pool not plugging in your coffee maker and the
[02:15:06.640 --> 02:15:11.720]  floor is wet you get electrocuted but the greatest danger that we can avoid is
[02:15:11.720 --> 02:15:16.200]  tyranny governments the number one killer and enslaver and thief in history
[02:15:16.200 --> 02:15:20.560]  study history they're the threat and we know this threat is mounting this
[02:15:20.560 --> 02:15:26.680]  humiliating threat so go down to our state house we own and go in there and
[02:15:26.680 --> 02:15:30.040]  say direct me to the state Senate offices and you go in at least go to five
[02:15:30.040 --> 02:15:35.160]  of those senators office how many state senators we got 31 I got it right I said
[02:15:35.160 --> 02:15:42.480]  31 32 whatever point is let's go to who's up next year John Paul in Michigan
[02:15:42.480 --> 02:15:48.600]  Paul you're on the air hey Alex thanks for taking my call I just want to say to
[02:15:48.600 --> 02:15:54.160]  all you people in Texas from Michigan's my family my friends support you tell
[02:15:54.160 --> 02:16:00.240]  TSA no and hopefully your courage will rub off on the sorry senators we have
[02:16:00.240 --> 02:16:04.720]  here and maybe we can abolish these people all together just keep leaving the
[02:16:04.720 --> 02:16:09.080]  fight Texas and kick some butt that's all I can say well God bless you Paul I
[02:16:09.080 --> 02:16:12.680]  appreciate your call and again today nowadays it is courage because
[02:16:12.680 --> 02:16:15.760]  government bugs their eyes out at you and once you know treat you like scum
[02:16:15.760 --> 02:16:20.160]  the bureaucracy does the reps are pretty good and in a lot of cases I know a lot
[02:16:20.160 --> 02:16:22.960]  of them a lot of more listeners are running them in restaurants on the
[02:16:22.960 --> 02:16:29.600]  street we need to realize you they unanimously are saying and stood up to
[02:16:29.600 --> 02:16:36.760]  this criminal-fed mafia government but it's not courage it's duty and it's
[02:16:36.760 --> 02:16:41.920]  blind courage to let this tyranny come in listen it's the opposite of courage
[02:16:41.920 --> 02:16:45.400]  here I'm gonna tell you something if I see a car coming towards them I'll jump
[02:16:45.400 --> 02:16:49.480]  out of the way that's that's not I mean what we're doing is trying to stop this
[02:16:49.480 --> 02:16:55.280]  evil it's the opposite of courage we understand how dangerous this is this
[02:16:55.280 --> 02:17:00.520]  is self-preservation ladies and gentlemen this isn't courage I'm not
[02:17:00.520 --> 02:17:05.120]  disagreeing with you Paul the end of the day to be at the front of the spear on
[02:17:05.120 --> 02:17:10.760]  this would seem to be courage but it's not it's a lie it's an illusion going
[02:17:10.760 --> 02:17:15.920]  along with tyranny will keep you safe for a little while but in the end it
[02:17:15.920 --> 02:17:21.160]  leads to total enslavement and I will not submit to the tyranny James in New
[02:17:21.160 --> 02:17:28.600]  Jersey you're on the air hello James welcome hi thank you thank you very
[02:17:28.600 --> 02:17:31.840]  much for taking my call I just want to tell everybody in Texas you know just
[02:17:31.840 --> 02:17:34.840]  like you've been saying they need to exercise the right to go down there and
[02:17:34.840 --> 02:17:38.320]  peacefully assemble and protest this because this is essentially declaration
[02:17:38.320 --> 02:17:43.440]  of war by the federal government also train is to protest that we're going to
[02:17:43.440 --> 02:17:48.640]  talk to our peers we're going to talk to our servants okay so it's not even
[02:17:48.640 --> 02:17:53.480]  protesting so much go ahead definitely and you know if they want to shut down
[02:17:53.480 --> 02:17:57.040]  the airport over Texas and the people need to tell the Senate and that's fine
[02:17:57.040 --> 02:18:00.760]  shut down there'll be no plane flying over here because you know what that
[02:18:00.760 --> 02:18:04.480]  privilege of flying in that nice convenience it's not worth losing the
[02:18:04.480 --> 02:18:07.960]  liberty of the Constitution which the country is founded on the point is they'll
[02:18:07.960 --> 02:18:11.440]  back off what did the British do in fact if you study it in the first few years
[02:18:11.440 --> 02:18:16.920]  before 1776 they would embargo a town is punishment our forefathers let them
[02:18:16.920 --> 02:18:22.960]  shut down towns shut down ports in some cases for years I mean it we looked at
[02:18:22.960 --> 02:18:27.720]  tyrants act the same way people said we're sick of you stopping us without
[02:18:27.720 --> 02:18:31.440]  warrants and searching our wagons coming in our houses searching us at public
[02:18:31.440 --> 02:18:37.560]  places we're done it wasn't just the stamp on everything that you own so
[02:18:37.560 --> 02:18:42.240]  they could tax it it was that they were coming in to inspect it just like they
[02:18:42.240 --> 02:18:44.800]  say now we don't need warrants for home inspections we don't need warrants to
[02:18:44.800 --> 02:18:50.000]  inspect your farm because we say so right and people have to understand you
[02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:53.360]  know they don't have another 15 20 years I mean I personally known about all
[02:18:53.360 --> 02:18:56.200]  this stuff for over 10 years ever since I was they're getting ready to start
[02:18:56.200 --> 02:18:59.800]  World War three right now I'm sorry go ahead and I would just like to say you
[02:18:59.800 --> 02:19:04.160]  know everybody you know Obama is going to be reelected in 2012 because that's
[02:19:04.160 --> 02:19:07.480]  the way they set it up and like I said you don't have another five six years
[02:19:07.480 --> 02:19:11.440]  because by the end of 2016 when he's out of office I mean assuming that he does
[02:19:11.440 --> 02:19:16.360]  leave we will not have what we consider America even today at this point it's
[02:19:16.360 --> 02:19:19.880]  gonna be so much worse with the Fed and the PSA they have all the they've
[02:19:19.880 --> 02:19:25.360]  already imploded everything we're our economy is walking zombie they admit
[02:19:25.360 --> 02:19:29.320]  it's a zombie that they don't call the economy a zombie everything is being
[02:19:29.320 --> 02:19:33.480]  siphoned off to the offshore crime cartel to make us bankrupt so they can
[02:19:33.480 --> 02:19:39.320]  come back and loan us our own money at loan sharking interest I mean look the
[02:19:39.320 --> 02:19:44.960]  it shows how far we've fallen that it is seen as something brave and great to go
[02:19:44.960 --> 02:19:49.640]  tell the senators hey do what the house did vote unanimously stand for the
[02:19:49.640 --> 02:19:55.600]  feds call them on their bluff okay I mean it's for their children too just

[02:24:01.320 --> 02:24:12.000]  okay I want to go back to your calls ahead of Cynthia McKinney joining us from
[02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:18.320]  Tripoli under bombardment by globalist forces the hijacked this nation and we'll
[02:24:18.320 --> 02:24:22.800]  soon take over there as if they continue they have their al-Qaeda rebels
[02:24:22.800 --> 02:24:26.120]  overtaking Arab nations everywhere openly telling us now that al-Qaeda is
[02:24:26.120 --> 02:24:33.240]  good I don't agree with that but again I'm the bad man I harken back to 2007 in
[02:24:33.240 --> 02:24:37.240]  our intel from Bilderberg group in the meetings the elitist openly said we've
[02:24:37.240 --> 02:24:41.520]  got to destroy the economy now because we want to make people so poor they can't
[02:24:41.520 --> 02:24:44.800]  afford to be out there protesting it's actually said that how do all the people
[02:24:44.800 --> 02:24:48.600]  have money to travel everywhere around the world and protest us and see that's
[02:24:48.600 --> 02:24:53.680]  the instinct of a share crop owner with his slaves or a slave master is to keep
[02:24:53.680 --> 02:25:00.520]  you down they don't like middle-class uppity people who won't step and fetch
[02:25:00.520 --> 02:25:05.280]  when they say and that's why they're destroying our economy right now let's
[02:25:05.280 --> 02:25:09.780]  go to mr. Abbott in Illinois you're on the air go ahead hi doing Alex pretty
[02:25:09.780 --> 02:25:14.880]  good all right long-time listener actually woke up at 12 years old I'm
[02:25:14.880 --> 02:25:19.800]  now 24 with two children happily married and really an entrepreneur in many ways
[02:25:19.800 --> 02:25:25.520]  and many different industries my family and I own and operate a a business that
[02:25:25.520 --> 02:25:28.920]  has to do with the agriculture industry I want to be very vague due to
[02:25:28.920 --> 02:25:33.200]  confidentiality and we're on live but anyhow we experienced many many moves
[02:25:33.200 --> 02:25:38.480]  you know as lead we've been eliminating many products since they cannot be
[02:25:38.480 --> 02:25:43.600]  produced we've experienced many losses however we are surviving and we are an
[02:25:43.600 --> 02:25:48.040]  ethnic family owned operated company going into the mainstream market serving
[02:25:48.040 --> 02:25:53.000]  Walmart Costco and it's really getting tough I'm also getting in touch with
[02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:57.040]  Ali from we are changing Chicago you know as you notice our political
[02:25:57.040 --> 02:26:01.120]  industry is really corrupt and as you see the can't the concept of our
[02:26:01.120 --> 02:26:05.440]  campaigns I believe is very wrong because you have thousands of candidates
[02:26:05.440 --> 02:26:10.560]  around the US on a local county estate and federal levels yet everybody's on a
[02:26:10.560 --> 02:26:15.680]  different page why can't we have one campaign thousands of candidates on the
[02:26:15.680 --> 02:26:19.280]  same page whether that's happening that's happening and I appreciate your
[02:26:19.280 --> 02:26:24.800]  call what's happening is that's why Bilderberg group three years running is
[02:26:24.800 --> 02:26:28.600]  so scared of Ron Paul not that he would win his first presidential run or even
[02:26:28.600 --> 02:26:33.640]  a second that it's creating a libertarian anti-new-world order movement that
[02:26:33.640 --> 02:26:37.920]  identifies the puppet masters not the puppets that's what Brzezinski talked
[02:26:37.920 --> 02:26:43.160]  about last year at the CFR in video that the elite is in trouble look they're in
[02:26:43.160 --> 02:26:48.280]  trouble we are identifying them the Liberty movement is exploding the
[02:26:48.280 --> 02:26:52.000]  Republicans tried to co-opt the Tea Party we're co-opting them instead it's
[02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:59.920]  on let's go to Richard in Canada Richard in Canada you're on the air
[02:26:59.920 --> 02:27:06.280]  I applaud you for your initiative today that's great I called back to your Texas
[02:27:06.280 --> 02:27:09.520]  state I was talking about I would like to come to the Texas because it seems like a
[02:27:09.520 --> 02:27:14.440]  nice place but I don't want to do it if I have to get my crotch grabbed and what
[02:27:14.440 --> 02:27:20.160]  are they saying well it was just the it was just a recording it was just the
[02:27:20.160 --> 02:27:24.520]  recording but you know speaking of police data eugenics are alive and well in
[02:27:24.520 --> 02:27:28.880]  Canada I didn't know this before but apparently they were forcibly sterilized
[02:27:28.880 --> 02:27:33.560]  people who they feel are mentally retarded or however the poor really
[02:27:33.560 --> 02:27:39.200]  correct phrases because I'll tell you the story my girlfriend she's taken the
[02:27:39.200 --> 02:27:43.720]  bus early in the morning to get to work and there's always this one girl who
[02:27:43.720 --> 02:27:47.920]  what I was coming talk to her but she'd always you know she had a full-time job
[02:27:47.920 --> 02:27:53.480]  she you know I don't know and then one day she basically told her that she what
[02:27:53.480 --> 02:27:56.920]  happened to her and she was sore and because they forced to be sterilized or
[02:27:56.920 --> 02:28:00.560]  she my girlfriend asked you you didn't want to start with with seriously
[02:28:00.560 --> 02:28:05.480]  retarded people then they mildly and then next single family people have their
[02:28:05.480 --> 02:28:11.160]  kids sterilized and that went on hundreds of over 500,000 women in the
[02:28:11.160 --> 02:28:16.040]  United States up until the 1980s and it still quietly goes on they also in
[02:28:16.040 --> 02:28:19.760]  Canada in the last few years it came out in major papers sterilized completely
[02:28:19.760 --> 02:28:26.760]  healthy happy Native American boys and girls in orphanages I mean they take
[02:28:26.760 --> 02:28:30.960]  they take them out that's on your news and the government goes yep we're
[02:28:30.960 --> 02:28:35.400]  liberals and we're gonna sterilize them engines see as long as you say your
[02:28:35.400 --> 02:28:40.520]  liberal and then go out and sterilize and try to force minorities have abortions
[02:28:40.520 --> 02:28:43.840]  then it's who that's trendy kill them brown people make sure they don't ever
[02:28:43.840 --> 02:28:52.440]  have kids oh yeah it's bad I'm trying to find as much info do you remember
[02:28:52.440 --> 02:28:59.000]  the publications that was in now it's been all over national post Ottawa
[02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:11.000]  citizens just type in type in a native children sterilized at state-funded
[02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:17.480]  orphanage or bodies of killed natives found they just dug up a bunch killed
[02:29:17.480 --> 02:29:21.080]  in the 80s actually kill them to be a living walking around people so they
[02:29:21.080 --> 02:29:24.840]  dug up a bunch dead bodies it's pretty horrible also they would take babies they
[02:29:24.840 --> 02:29:27.680]  would have get rid of them that way especially if it was the people running
[02:29:27.680 --> 02:29:31.680]  the orphanage they got them pregnant why have an abortion we can just kill the
[02:29:31.680 --> 02:29:35.520]  baby ever it's born yeah that's been all over your news sir I mean all over it
[02:29:35.520 --> 02:29:38.680]  I've probably seen I don't eight nine ten eleven news articles last few years but
[02:29:38.680 --> 02:29:43.400]  it's kind of like well should we be sterilizing their the children I mean
[02:29:43.400 --> 02:29:51.840]  after all their natives after all this liberal Margaret Sanger we're on the

[02:33:26.640 --> 02:33:31.000]  off of the bill and was the main leader on the unanimously passed bill to enforce
[02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:35.360]  the law not let TSA stick their hands on the outside and inside of men women and
[02:33:35.360 --> 02:33:40.120]  children's pants and grab their genitals and when he left as I talked to him
[02:33:40.120 --> 02:33:44.040]  in the break he said yeah we've still got till I'm you know later tonight it's
[02:33:44.040 --> 02:33:49.560]  last day of the session or the last day for this bill to be able to get through
[02:33:49.560 --> 02:33:52.680]  there may be a day or two left but a lot's happening the point is we need to
[02:33:52.680 --> 02:33:56.840]  get down there today need to go to the capital Texas capital did you know this
[02:33:56.840 --> 02:34:00.360]  it's normal you go and you talk to your state senators not the house members
[02:34:00.360 --> 02:34:03.840]  they unanimously voted to do the right thing you go pat them on the back of
[02:34:03.840 --> 02:34:07.360]  you want but what needs to be done first is there's only 31 of these senators
[02:34:07.360 --> 02:34:11.480]  and you need to go to every one of their offices and you can also go in in the
[02:34:11.480 --> 02:34:16.080]  gallery and you know watch the whole thing in session and let these folks
[02:34:16.080 --> 02:34:24.080]  know that in their offices that you do not like what's happening so that's
[02:34:24.080 --> 02:34:28.720]  what we're dealing with right now and I've already got Rob Jacobson down there
[02:34:28.720 --> 02:34:34.200]  he sees a few people obviously I just called for this an hour ago I'm going
[02:34:34.200 --> 02:34:39.120]  to leave here at about 210 central and I'll be down there in part by 230 240 or
[02:34:39.120 --> 02:34:43.520]  so the point is this I'll be in there you'll see me but the point is it's for
[02:34:43.520 --> 02:34:47.240]  you as a citizen to go talk it's not even a demonstration or a rally later if
[02:34:47.240 --> 02:34:50.960]  folks want to congregate you know in the South Lawn or something media needs to
[02:34:50.960 --> 02:34:54.280]  be there you know I guess we could do that at four o'clock or something the
[02:34:54.280 --> 02:34:57.960]  point is I've even got other stuff I got to do on top of this we need to go down
[02:34:57.960 --> 02:35:00.680]  there talk to our senators because they're just ignoring the phone calls
[02:35:00.680 --> 02:35:05.000]  because they're getting so many phone calls right now and say look it's
[02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:08.160]  illegal what the TSA is doing they don't have a law to back it up the state rep
[02:35:08.160 --> 02:35:13.080]  talked about that earlier they're just brazenly doing it we need to get down
[02:35:13.080 --> 02:35:18.160]  there we need to go I'm asking you to go I don't do a lot of demonstrations or
[02:35:18.160 --> 02:35:21.440]  events I've done it I've been on international television national TV
[02:35:21.440 --> 02:35:28.880]  nightline you name it I've spoken to rallies at 10,000 people 2,000 people a
[02:35:28.880 --> 02:35:32.960]  thousand just it I don't just go around doing these events because I realized
[02:35:32.960 --> 02:35:37.000]  that it's about talking to the senators it's about informing people
[02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:41.000]  electronically through the media but it but but showing yourself on events like
[02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:46.000]  this this is what it's all about it's about the people showing that you'll
[02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:52.640]  feel by their physical presence that they are against what's happening now
[02:35:52.640 --> 02:35:59.000]  joining us from Tripoli Libya under months and months of bombardment British
[02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:04.280]  attack helicopters now being dispatched US and British forces advising admitted
[02:36:04.280 --> 02:36:08.920]  Taliban and al-Qaeda in the fight against Muammar Qaddafi the attempted
[02:36:08.920 --> 02:36:12.000]  assassinations are ongoing and they're not even calling them assassinations
[02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:15.840]  even though they're admitted the Russians are now calling for an immediate
[02:36:15.840 --> 02:36:20.440]  ceasefire in Libya saying this is an attack a humanitarian disaster they now
[02:36:20.440 --> 02:36:23.840]  admit the arrest of the Arab Springs are being funded by the CIA that's now
[02:36:23.840 --> 02:36:28.840]  admitted Google and others in Europe have just been praised for it former
[02:36:28.840 --> 02:36:32.320]  Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney has been demonized because she has a lot of
[02:36:32.320 --> 02:36:36.400]  courage she spoke up against a dying Corrin Halliburton child kidnapping rings
[02:36:36.400 --> 02:36:42.000]  and got Rumsfeld to admit it she fought against force inoculations she she
[02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:46.080]  fought against the Patriot Act she has a lot of courage and she's member of the
[02:36:46.080 --> 02:36:52.200]  Green Party she's been awarded the Peace Through Conscience Award for the
[02:36:52.200 --> 02:36:56.520]  Munich American Peace Committee and yesterday she appeared on state-run
[02:36:56.520 --> 02:37:02.040]  Libyan TV and that's caused quite a hubbub here domestically because she
[02:37:02.040 --> 02:37:04.800]  has the courage to go to that we were talking to her yesterday on the phone
[02:37:04.800 --> 02:37:09.120]  with bombs going off the background Congresswoman we appreciate you joining
[02:37:09.120 --> 02:37:16.520]  us Alex it's been too long I have wanted to come on your show for so long but
[02:37:16.520 --> 02:37:23.880]  it's quite you know whatever we get together it's wonderful so thank you
[02:37:23.880 --> 02:37:32.760]  so much for having me on and you know it's dark here now and after the meeting
[02:37:32.760 --> 02:37:39.920]  of President Cameron we expect that there will be intense bombing tonight we
[02:37:39.920 --> 02:37:45.200]  don't know that but we expect that that's what is in store for us more
[02:37:45.200 --> 02:37:50.960]  humanitarian intervention from NATO and Obama told Cameron no let-up on Gaddafi
[02:37:50.960 --> 02:37:56.440]  now have you talked to Gaddafi what have you witnessed what are you seeing we're
[02:37:56.440 --> 02:38:00.320]  seeing the images of civilian dead burning buildings and our media tells
[02:38:00.320 --> 02:38:04.560]  us 1984 style this is not an assault this is not an attack this is
[02:38:04.560 --> 02:38:09.440]  humanitarian they're sinking on eight ships last week in the harbor bombs
[02:38:09.440 --> 02:38:14.920]  going off everywhere more bombs yesterday what are you witnessing they're
[02:38:14.920 --> 02:38:22.080]  lying the American people are being lied to not only by the media by their
[02:38:22.080 --> 02:38:30.360]  leaders and this is becoming a humanitarian disaster for example I have a
[02:38:30.360 --> 02:38:37.920]  an Italian woman here who did everything she could to purchase medicines
[02:38:37.920 --> 02:38:44.920]  because they want to purchase medicines and the government of Italy put a stop
[02:38:44.920 --> 02:38:50.680]  on the purchase by the Libyans of medicine for their people and that's a
[02:38:50.680 --> 02:38:56.240]  violation of the Geneva Convention that is a serious war crime that's right and
[02:38:56.240 --> 02:39:06.640]  then we have the situation with the fuel for civilian youth they have
[02:39:06.640 --> 02:39:14.160]  effectively blockaded the harbor so that deliveries of benzene to fuel the
[02:39:14.160 --> 02:39:22.200]  cars is not permitted and this is affecting the civilian population so
[02:39:22.200 --> 02:39:30.640]  you will see what looks like a traffic jam and actually it's cars lined up
[02:39:30.640 --> 02:39:40.080]  hundreds of cars lined up at the service station so there have Liby under
[02:39:40.080 --> 02:39:44.760]  siege tell us what it's like on the ground tell us tell us what you're
[02:39:44.760 --> 02:39:51.440]  witnessing tell us what you said on Libyan television well basically now
[02:39:51.440 --> 02:40:00.640]  here's the interesting thing because these people the Libyans are undeterred
[02:40:00.640 --> 02:40:08.400]  they seem to be unafraid I was with a group of women I wrote in the piece that
[02:40:08.400 --> 02:40:16.800]  I did a feast of blood about a woman whose mother is in Benghazi and she can't
[02:40:16.800 --> 02:40:21.000]  it's sort of like the situation with Hurricane Katrina she can't get back to
[02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:27.720]  Benghazi because you know Benghazi is the stronghold of the rebels now the
[02:40:27.720 --> 02:40:32.320]  interesting thing what I've been told today I haven't checked it out yet but
[02:40:32.320 --> 02:40:40.800]  that there is sort of active Israeli intervention in Benghazi and that the
[02:40:40.800 --> 02:40:46.240]  Israelis are on the ground under contract probably being paid to organize
[02:40:46.240 --> 02:40:55.880]  the NATO alliance of that consists of Libyans but it's my understanding that
[02:40:55.880 --> 02:41:04.480]  these so-called rebels are not just Libyans they are people from all over the
[02:41:04.480 --> 02:41:11.240]  region these are these are not even mainly Libyans these are Egyptians and
[02:41:11.240 --> 02:41:16.720]  Algerians and it's the CIA secret al-Qaeda brigades from the 1980s that's
[02:41:16.720 --> 02:41:21.120]  now been admitted and and there's US and British commandos have been there
[02:41:21.120 --> 02:41:26.600]  since before it started that's now confirmed this is absolutely incredible
[02:41:26.600 --> 02:41:33.000]  why did you decide to go to Libya former Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney
[02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:42.960]  well I guess you know I'm I'm accustomed to going into conflict zones and I
[02:41:42.960 --> 02:41:53.560]  just could not accept that this was being done in my name and you know it there
[02:41:53.560 --> 02:41:58.960]  comes a point when you're fed up you're tired and you want to do as much as you
[02:41:58.960 --> 02:42:05.040]  can possibly do and of course I come from the Catholic tradition that instructs
[02:42:05.040 --> 02:42:11.840]  us that we have an obligation we have a responsibility to do as much as we are
[02:42:11.840 --> 02:42:22.040]  gifted to do and so being here was my way of of making a contribution and sure
[02:42:22.040 --> 02:42:29.120]  enough the fact that I was here when the most intense bombardment of Tripoli
[02:42:29.120 --> 02:42:34.720]  this is Tripoli I mean can you imagine I'm not talking about you know out in the
[02:42:34.720 --> 02:42:43.840]  farmland where you just disboiling the the agricultural land I'm talking about
[02:42:43.840 --> 02:42:49.160]  Tripoli a metropolitan area of two million people and they're being hit
[02:42:49.160 --> 02:42:53.240]  with bombs I mean it is absolutely incredible and it's cold
[02:42:53.240 --> 02:43:01.080]  humanitarian what that has to do with any kind of humanitarian intervention is
[02:43:01.080 --> 02:43:08.480]  beyond me this is what we know the United States to be very good at and
[02:43:08.480 --> 02:43:12.960]  particularly on the African continent we've seen it over and over and over
[02:43:12.960 --> 02:43:21.000]  again individuals of wealth and resource who are able to pull the levers on U.S.
[02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:30.800]  military and diplomatic policy are able to arm a small group of people give them
[02:43:30.800 --> 02:43:37.640]  the financial wherewithal to wreak havoc and terror on a population and then
[02:43:37.640 --> 02:43:43.240]  all of a sudden presto abracadabra you've got what what is called in the
[02:43:43.240 --> 02:43:49.400]  media a civil war well it's not a civil war it's a group of people who've
[02:43:49.400 --> 02:43:55.000]  decided that they want something that that particular area has for example in
[02:43:55.000 --> 02:44:02.040]  Sierra Leone it was diamonds and when the British Sandline mercenaries went
[02:44:02.040 --> 02:44:08.080]  into the home of Fode Sanko what did they find there a letter from Maurice
[02:44:08.080 --> 02:44:15.680]  Templesman proposing to do business so this is the kind of thing that motivates
[02:44:15.680 --> 02:44:23.200]  U.S. policy and I am certain that at the end of an investigation were we to have
[02:44:23.200 --> 02:44:28.480]  one we would find that there are certain individuals involved in this and they
[02:44:28.480 --> 02:44:36.000]  are able to dictate to the president Cameron to Sarkozy to all of the NATO
[02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:41.160]  alike allies they are able to dictate them going to war well we know what it's
[02:44:41.160 --> 02:44:45.600]  about the Al Qaeda rebels have already set up their own bank they've already
[02:44:45.600 --> 02:44:50.400]  set up their their own oil company and it's about handing over the trillions
[02:44:50.400 --> 02:44:54.960]  in oil also the water say what you want about Muammar Gaddafi he's built up an
[02:44:54.960 --> 02:44:59.520]  infrastructure he's actually delivered to the people the government spoils and
[02:44:59.520 --> 02:45:04.560]  it's become a major hub for all of Africa and he's been developing Africa and
[02:45:04.560 --> 02:45:10.760]  moving towards an African currency and a loan program he's got hundreds of
[02:45:10.760 --> 02:45:15.600]  billions in gold and other resources and you can say what you want about Gaddafi
[02:45:15.600 --> 02:45:21.440]  but bottom line this is a takeover you know how can the neocon media call you
[02:45:21.440 --> 02:45:25.080]  a traitor for being over there reporting the truth when it's admitted
[02:45:25.080 --> 02:45:29.840]  that what Gaddafi said three months ago was true that the main force this is now
[02:45:29.840 --> 02:45:34.520]  in the Wall Street Journal and LA Times that is running all this he is Al Qaeda
[02:45:34.520 --> 02:45:39.480]  and in fact the Al Qaeda commander under CIA payroll admits that he killed U.S.
[02:45:39.480 --> 02:45:45.120]  soldiers or commanded groups in Iraq so you're against people that killed U.S.
[02:45:45.120 --> 02:45:50.240]  soldiers and so you're bad Cynthia I mean what's wrong just join Al Qaeda and
[02:45:50.240 --> 02:45:55.520]  the neocons are gonna say you're great well that's exactly the point because
[02:45:55.520 --> 02:46:02.480]  we remember what Robin Cook the now deceased foreign minister in the United
[02:46:02.480 --> 02:46:09.080]  Kingdom had to say about Al Qaeda he just said it was the CIA's Rolodex so it
[02:46:09.080 --> 02:46:13.600]  is and he died a week later that killed him real fast and they got rid of him
[02:46:13.600 --> 02:46:21.560]  yeah so so I mean you know it's not the situation that the United States is
[02:46:21.560 --> 02:46:27.560]  allied with Al Qaeda is not unusual what is unusual is that they actually admit
[02:46:27.560 --> 02:46:34.360]  it because what they have been saying to the American people and to the world is
[02:46:34.360 --> 02:46:41.680]  that Al Qaeda is the bad guy and that's who we've got to get but I will never
[02:46:41.680 --> 02:46:50.960]  forget the op-ed that was written by Robin Cook and so I advise everybody I
[02:46:50.960 --> 02:46:54.680]  know you talk about this and you you know you're one of the rare truth tellers
[02:46:54.680 --> 02:47:03.400]  and so you will remember this but the fact that we had someone of Robin Cook
[02:47:03.400 --> 02:47:09.040]  stature and position to tell us the truth about exactly what Al Qaeda was is
[02:47:09.040 --> 02:47:13.360]  very important is something not to be forgot I agree and the word was he was
[02:47:13.360 --> 02:47:16.840]  gonna come out and document that they'd murdered dr. David Kelly it's now
[02:47:16.840 --> 02:47:21.280]  coming out they murdered Diana that's big news and and they couldn't allow him
[02:47:21.280 --> 02:47:24.440]  with that with that high level you know like number two or three in the
[02:47:24.440 --> 02:47:28.400]  British government they killed him so fast it made a everybody's head spin
[02:47:28.400 --> 02:47:32.520]  out now Congresswoman this is so important what is the mood of the
[02:47:32.520 --> 02:47:36.840]  Libyans under these these love bombs that are killing so many these
[02:47:36.840 --> 02:47:41.360]  humanitarian kinetic attacks and the word of the attack helicopters coming
[02:47:41.360 --> 02:47:45.200]  more weapons I don't bring this up because you're black it's it's in the
[02:47:45.200 --> 02:47:50.840]  news we reported it over a month ago that Gaddafi's been allied with just a
[02:47:50.840 --> 02:47:56.840]  coalition and the tribes he's with are not anti black African and that the and
[02:47:56.840 --> 02:48:00.440]  it's admitted that they're lining up blacks and killing them in the areas
[02:48:00.440 --> 02:48:06.400]  held by Al Qaeda and what's the word on that on the genocide against black
[02:48:06.400 --> 02:48:12.560]  Africans in Libya well here's another thing that is absolutely astounding
[02:48:12.560 --> 02:48:19.480]  and that is this whole idea that black people shouldn't be in Africa which is
[02:48:19.480 --> 02:48:25.480]  something that was promulgated by the American press when I presume is that
[02:48:25.480 --> 02:48:30.080]  when they landed and they saw black people all over Libya they were shocked
[02:48:30.080 --> 02:48:36.920]  well the fact of the matter is that you've got a sizable chunk of black
[02:48:36.920 --> 02:48:46.120]  people in Libya because you've got black people all over Africa you know it's
[02:48:46.120 --> 02:48:53.400]  just it's a horrible and it's insulting to the Libyans themselves and so now they
[02:48:53.400 --> 02:49:03.000]  have their own citizens who are being killed beheaded in fact I'm having the
[02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:08.000]  video of this I think there may be some footage of this on the Internet already
[02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:14.200]  but I am getting it uploaded now so that I can disseminate it through my own
[02:49:14.200 --> 02:49:25.520]  network of the the family members of those Libyans who were lynched they've
[02:49:25.520 --> 02:49:31.240]  gone to lynching and beheadings of the blacks and this is being done by the
[02:49:31.240 --> 02:49:35.520]  NATO allies because it's known that blacks on average are supportive of
[02:49:35.520 --> 02:49:40.120]  Qaddafi because he he doesn't lynch him and chop their heads off
[02:49:40.120 --> 02:49:46.160]  in Libya guess what people don't have to go through the insurance company in
[02:49:46.160 --> 02:49:50.600]  order to get to see their doctor they have free health care over here they
[02:49:50.600 --> 02:49:57.240]  don't have to go through a bank in order to have a relationship with their
[02:49:57.240 --> 02:50:02.480]  professor at a university because they have free education over here all the
[02:50:02.480 --> 02:50:07.200]  way up through the PhD level you go to school and you don't pay no no I've studied
[02:50:07.200 --> 02:50:10.880]  Libya I don't even agree with socialism because it only works if you have a
[02:50:10.880 --> 02:50:14.880]  benevolent dictator and I'm not saying he's that but Qaddafi does take most the
[02:50:14.880 --> 02:50:18.560]  money and actually use it that you've been there many times I've seen the
[02:50:18.560 --> 02:50:23.320]  video the reports it is a shining jewel of development and they want that giant
[02:50:23.320 --> 02:50:28.200]  canal he's built that huge airport they built for african to launch attacks all
[02:50:28.200 --> 02:50:32.560]  over after I mean really Libya is the beach head to really take over Africa is
[02:50:32.560 --> 02:50:40.720]  that the word there that's right in addition to that you have the European
[02:50:40.720 --> 02:50:48.520]  countries we're trying to have some Mediterranean alliance and what they
[02:50:48.520 --> 02:50:55.360]  proposed was that the African countries on the Mediterranean literal be joined
[02:50:55.360 --> 02:51:04.240]  in a economic arrangement with all of Europe and Qaddafi was the one who said
[02:51:04.240 --> 02:51:11.840]  no that's not fair if it's all of Europe then it ought to be all of Africa and so
[02:51:11.840 --> 02:51:19.320]  he put a stop to that particular plan and so that is in limbo now but of course
[02:51:19.320 --> 02:51:25.200]  you know nothing would be in limbo if you got those puppets the NATO allies
[02:51:25.200 --> 02:51:31.480]  in control and recognized as a legitimate government of Libya sent the
[02:51:31.480 --> 02:51:36.480]  incredible sent the incredible what are the bombardments like what are you
[02:51:36.480 --> 02:51:43.600]  witnessing what is the feeling of the Libyan people that you've met with well
[02:51:43.600 --> 02:51:55.240]  I had so many Libyans you know it's kind of obvious that I'm an American and was
[02:51:55.240 --> 02:52:03.320]  open my mouth and so they asked me why why are they the Americans doing this
[02:52:03.320 --> 02:52:11.920]  because you know Qaddafi made many concessions and invited the American
[02:52:11.920 --> 02:52:15.560]  companies and I mean you know he made a deal he gave up the weapons he kissed
[02:52:15.560 --> 02:52:22.360]  their romp I mean he did everything that's right and and and the American
[02:52:22.360 --> 02:52:28.720]  companies are here they're here in full force and and even that wasn't good
[02:52:28.720 --> 02:52:33.000]  enough now there's another thing that I'll be writing a little bit more about
[02:52:33.000 --> 02:52:39.560]  and that's supposed to be the geological survey that the Libyan
[02:52:39.560 --> 02:52:46.320]  government had just to ascertain exactly what their resources were and the
[02:52:46.320 --> 02:52:53.560]  extent of whatever the mineral reserved were that they had and it apparently it
[02:52:53.560 --> 02:53:06.120]  came back that Libya had far more oil resources than they previously thought
[02:53:06.120 --> 02:53:12.960]  the word is instead of one trillion five trillion the oil worth it almost as much
[02:53:12.960 --> 02:53:15.360]  as all the rest the oil that's been discovered in Africa from the numbers
[02:53:15.360 --> 02:53:21.880]  I've seen and one of the biggest areas with deep aquifers of water now now
[02:53:21.880 --> 02:53:25.160]  now we've only got about seven eight minutes left with Congresswoman Cynthia
[02:53:25.160 --> 02:53:28.760]  McKinney former Congresswoman one of the best websites people to read your
[02:53:28.760 --> 02:53:32.760]  reports of what's really happening in Libya and and other key points that you'd
[02:53:32.760 --> 02:53:36.360]  like to add for the international media that is undoubtedly going to pick up on
[02:53:36.360 --> 02:53:45.320]  this interview today well I presume that people could go to my Facebook page or
[02:53:45.320 --> 02:53:51.560]  Twitter and they can get the dispatches that I send out I'm in the process of
[02:53:51.560 --> 02:53:58.080]  preparing one now about how the Qaddafi family members were murdered I went and
[02:53:58.080 --> 02:54:02.960]  visited that compound and that is amazing it's not even a compound it's a
[02:54:02.960 --> 02:54:06.560]  house in a residential neighborhood I mean and that's illegal too they're
[02:54:06.560 --> 02:54:10.640]  they're bombing houses they're trying to kill him and his family and then
[02:54:10.640 --> 02:54:15.280]  telling the public oh we're not doing that I know it is just patent lies now
[02:54:15.280 --> 02:54:19.120]  you asked about what it's like to be here I mean you know it's like every time
[02:54:19.120 --> 02:54:23.160]  that I'm in a hotel room and every time the air conditioner comes on you know I
[02:54:23.160 --> 02:54:28.840]  kind of jump because I know it's dark now and the bombardment is going to start
[02:54:28.840 --> 02:54:37.080]  and so any kind of pop or you know I I I've only been through it what three or
[02:54:37.080 --> 02:54:43.200]  four nights now and I can you imagine what our soldiers go you know are like
[02:54:43.200 --> 02:54:47.520]  when they come back with post-traumatic stress syndrome when they go through it
[02:54:47.520 --> 02:54:53.080]  night after night for you for month after month for year after year this is a
[02:54:53.080 --> 02:55:00.480]  and with the effect on the children and on the average ordinary civilians who
[02:55:00.480 --> 02:55:07.560]  are in no way you know we don't even know what the NATO design is other than to
[02:55:07.560 --> 02:55:12.960]  kill Qaddafi and to take over the country and we know that the folks on the
[02:55:12.960 --> 02:55:17.000]  east a lot of them want to slaughter the folks on the West Old Tribal differences
[02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:20.480]  and I'm sure just like the UN has helped carry out massacres and Rwandan other
[02:55:20.480 --> 02:55:25.080]  areas they can't wait to help out there they're gonna help folks with this
[02:55:25.080 --> 02:55:28.480]  humanitarian mass murder and now what do you make of the Russians coming out and
[02:55:28.480 --> 02:55:33.000]  saying this is not a humanitarian they're gonna try to go to the UN and and and put
[02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:37.400]  a veto in what do you expect to happen there Pakistan now says the US is getting
[02:55:37.400 --> 02:55:40.240]  ready to start a war with them the Chinese are saying they're ready to go
[02:55:40.240 --> 02:55:44.360]  toe-to-toe I mean it looks like we're moving towards World War 3 all with the
[02:55:44.360 --> 02:55:55.480]  left cover of Obama up there and so yes I'm not surprised that all of this would
[02:55:55.480 --> 02:56:00.560]  be happening under President Obama's watch and then of course we still have
[02:56:00.560 --> 02:56:06.600]  the cold warriors who believe that Russia and China are the ultimate and
[02:56:06.600 --> 02:56:12.160]  penultimate enemies of the United States and so rather than seeing the world
[02:56:12.160 --> 02:56:21.360]  as a global community they see the world as a collection of rivalries that
[02:56:21.360 --> 02:56:30.040]  need to be overcome and so I want if the the Russians or the Chinese are ready to
[02:56:30.040 --> 02:56:34.840]  put an end to what is happening here in Libya I would say thank you very much
[02:56:34.840 --> 02:56:41.840]  for helping bring some sanity back into policy I would be against the Russians
[02:56:41.840 --> 02:56:44.520]  when they were taken over Eastern Europe and and against that I was for the
[02:56:44.520 --> 02:56:48.880]  Berlin Wall falling I don't like the any tyrants we have become that you don't
[02:56:48.880 --> 02:56:54.320]  see Russian China blowing countries up everywhere no and in fact if you if you
[02:56:54.320 --> 02:56:59.920]  look at what the Chinese have done I've seen the tangible results of what the
[02:56:59.920 --> 02:57:04.720]  Chinese have provided in terms of development assistance around the
[02:57:04.720 --> 02:57:09.080]  African continent that's the word that Africans going in and the Pentagon
[02:57:09.080 --> 02:57:13.880]  admits this to block the Chinese developing Africa yes that's right and
[02:57:13.880 --> 02:57:19.040]  the worst thing of course you know the whole from the whole idea about what
[02:57:19.040 --> 02:57:26.840]  the what's a threat the threat only can be carried out if there is a means by
[02:57:26.840 --> 02:57:33.080]  which to do so and as long as you keep people poor and deprived then they do
[02:57:33.080 --> 02:57:38.320]  not have the ability to challenge you whether it's in areas of finance or is
[02:57:38.320 --> 02:57:44.280]  in education or science or whatever then you can remain exactly shifting gears
[02:57:44.280 --> 02:57:46.880]  was almost out of time we're going to one minute break if you can stay five
[02:57:46.880 --> 02:57:50.800]  more fine but I don't know yet congresswoman what do you make I know
[02:57:50.800 --> 02:57:53.560]  you're over in Libya bravely under bombardments you probably don't know
[02:57:53.560 --> 02:57:57.960]  but the media is trying to demonize you how dare you go report what's happening
[02:57:57.960 --> 02:58:02.480]  you know how dare you go give another view on things what do you make of the
[02:58:02.480 --> 02:58:08.760]  demonization of yourself for being over there Alex you know what it's like I mean
[02:58:08.760 --> 02:58:16.520]  you know I'm here with the Washington Times Los Angeles Times and the
[02:58:16.520 --> 02:58:21.600]  Washington Post Los Angeles Times and the New York Times reporters and the
[02:58:21.600 --> 02:58:24.720]  first thing that came out of their mouth to me was you're so courageous to be
[02:58:24.720 --> 02:58:31.480]  here but you know they would never print it and so at the end of the day it goes
[02:58:31.480 --> 02:58:35.320]  with the territory of telling the truth that's right our jobs easy we just tell
[02:58:35.320 --> 02:58:38.720]  the truth but few have the courage you have let me talk to you during this one
[02:58:38.720 --> 02:58:44.360]  minute break see if you can stay if not with this will be yet thank you for

[03:00:08.120 --> 03:00:11.920]  congresswoman Cynthia McKinney we're into overdrive when I end this
[03:00:11.920 --> 03:00:15.480]  transmission in five minutes I'm going to the Texas State Capitol they're locked
[03:00:15.480 --> 03:00:20.200]  in a battle the house is unanimously voted to tell the TSA they can't grope
[03:00:20.200 --> 03:00:23.320]  women and children and stick their hands on our pants the Senate was threatened
[03:00:23.320 --> 03:00:27.520]  by the feds for a federal blockade to block all aircraft in and out of Texas if
[03:00:27.520 --> 03:00:31.040]  we don't do that so I'm gonna be down there in about 30 40 minutes going to
[03:00:31.040 --> 03:00:34.520]  talk to my Texas state senators hope to see you in those offices yes there are
[03:00:34.520 --> 03:00:38.200]  representatives they'll talk to them congresswoman briefly what do you make of
[03:00:38.200 --> 03:00:45.560]  the power grab of the TSA well you know this this is absolutely outrageous that
[03:00:45.560 --> 03:00:50.840]  we are forced to literally take our clothes off in order to get on a plane
[03:00:50.840 --> 03:00:55.920]  and now Chuck Schumer tells us that we have to take our clothes off or be
[03:00:55.920 --> 03:01:04.120]  grouped by strangers at bus stations and other areas of you know for
[03:01:04.120 --> 03:01:09.200]  transportation so this is this is ridiculous this is not America anymore
[03:01:09.200 --> 03:01:15.160]  and that's what I say you know when when our members of Congress are so removed
[03:01:15.160 --> 03:01:21.960]  from the issues that and the needs of average ordinary American citizens we
[03:01:21.960 --> 03:01:25.880]  need change in a real way that's what people thought they were voting for for
[03:01:25.880 --> 03:01:31.800]  by when they voted for a president Obama and now I think this is ought to be a
[03:01:31.800 --> 03:01:37.440]  lesson for everyone that you cannot get the kind of substantive policy change
[03:01:37.440 --> 03:01:42.840]  that we need by merely going to the polls and voting for the same people I
[03:01:42.840 --> 03:01:46.960]  haven't seen the full Libya report but is it true that you've now gone public
[03:01:46.960 --> 03:01:50.360]  with the fact that a pack which is basically Israeli intelligence came to
[03:01:50.360 --> 03:01:55.440]  you and said we'll get behind you if you shift and basically bow down and sign
[03:01:55.440 --> 03:02:02.960]  a pledge to be a servant of Israel yes I'm really surprised about this getting
[03:02:02.960 --> 03:02:09.120]  traction so late because this was part this was actually the problem that I
[03:02:09.120 --> 03:02:18.080]  had when I ran for the first time in Congress in 1992 a fax came over the
[03:02:18.080 --> 03:02:22.800]  my fax machine from APAC and it was a pledge and it had like seven points on
[03:02:22.800 --> 03:02:27.440]  it and one of those points was the Jerusalem the capital city the other
[03:02:27.440 --> 03:02:34.360]  one was military superiority of Israel the other one was continued economic
[03:02:34.360 --> 03:02:37.800]  assistance that you know whatever level the Israel request and there were two
[03:02:37.800 --> 03:02:44.200]  other points I can't remember them and I refuse to sign the pledge I said well
[03:02:44.200 --> 03:02:47.640]  you know I haven't even gotten elected yet why don't you give me an
[03:02:47.640 --> 03:02:52.800]  opportunity to get them get into the office let me study the issue and then
[03:02:52.800 --> 03:02:59.080]  I'll see where we where our positions can coincide that wasn't good enough for
[03:02:59.080 --> 03:03:05.040]  them they wanted me to sign a pledge to all of those points and more before I
[03:03:05.040 --> 03:03:10.320]  even got into office and then what happened is that when I refused to sign
[03:03:10.320 --> 03:03:13.920]  the pledge then that's when I discovered that whether it's an environmental
[03:03:13.920 --> 03:03:18.160]  organization a woman's organization a piece organization didn't matter if
[03:03:18.160 --> 03:03:23.080]  but eventually I got the question did you sign the pledge and since I had to
[03:03:23.080 --> 03:03:28.680]  answer the question as a no then I didn't get any money so it's across the
[03:03:28.680 --> 03:03:32.600]  board unbelievable regardless what your view is on Israel this is a foreign
[03:03:32.600 --> 03:03:35.920]  country manipulating what's happening inside our nation it's all part of
[03:03:35.920 --> 03:03:40.640]  globalist domination in closing you're there how long will you be in Libya and
[03:03:40.640 --> 03:03:46.560]  what do you how do you see this ending well actually I am about to leave so
[03:03:46.560 --> 03:03:54.400]  that I can prepare for a delegation and hopefully we will be departing the USA
[03:03:54.400 --> 03:04:00.640]  very soon like in the next few days and I will have a delegation of about 15 to
