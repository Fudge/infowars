[00:00.000 --> 00:28.400]  99 days, 99 days, until the historic election.
[00:30.160 --> 00:34.000]  The way Fox News counts it, they count the day of the election as well, so that'd be 100 days, but
[00:35.120 --> 00:37.840]  anyway, you slice it. We're getting close into this historic event.
[00:39.600 --> 00:43.120]  Okay, I have done a lot of preparation for this Sunday transmission.
[00:44.160 --> 00:48.800]  Also, Ted Nugent's going to be calling in at the start of the second hour today with some really
[00:48.800 --> 00:59.200]  huge news. The Democrats banned a pro-police rally in New York. The governor just said you can't have it
[01:01.360 --> 01:05.600]  and said, any police that show up or give you support, they'll be fired. Any state police
[01:05.600 --> 01:10.560]  will be fired. He's God now. He said, because of COVID, but everybody else can demonstrate
[01:10.560 --> 01:17.440]  and have your protest. This is how the globalist communist Illuminati system operates.
[01:17.440 --> 01:25.680]  They'll be popping in. Okay, so it's now official. We've had Pelosi. We've had Biden. We've had Schiff.
[01:26.640 --> 01:33.440]  We've had Eric Holder, the former attorney general. We've had him all come out and say,
[01:34.640 --> 01:39.840]  Trump's a dictator already. He works for the Russians and he's going to lose the election.
[01:39.840 --> 01:46.080]  And then if he challenges it in any way, he is a dictator and the military is going to remove him.
[01:46.080 --> 01:50.640]  And if the military doesn't remove him, we'll have them arrested and we'll burn down all the cities.
[01:54.000 --> 01:57.440]  Next, Atlantic Monthly, which is the mouth of the New World Order,
[01:57.440 --> 02:00.480]  even more than New York Times here in the U.S., it's the Financial Times of London
[02:01.280 --> 02:03.120]  over in England. That's the Rothschild mouthpiece.
[02:05.760 --> 02:10.720]  They're openly saying violence and riots will skyrocket if Trump wins election. You better
[02:10.720 --> 02:18.240]  not do it. And then Moody's and Barons and all of the ratings agencies in Goldman Sachs and JP
[02:18.240 --> 02:22.960]  Morgan all say this will be a contested election. It's going to be a disaster, the mail-in ballots,
[02:22.960 --> 02:29.280]  the fraud. And if Trump points any of that out or you do, you're a dictator, even though the
[02:29.280 --> 02:33.600]  Democrats win and if they lose, I think right now there's anywhere near a fair election they're
[02:33.600 --> 02:41.440]  going to lose. The asylum majority is really pissed, but they don't care. They will contest it. And
[02:41.440 --> 02:46.160]  when Trump says you're there wrong, they're going to activate folks to burn the country down.
[02:46.160 --> 02:52.000]  And with 99 days out, this is all a beta test drill for that. And the censorship is in place and
[02:52.000 --> 02:56.640]  the AI kill switch is in place. And Trump has not gotten control of the Obama kill switch,
[02:56.640 --> 03:00.640]  but the deep state still has, or the globalists that are installed at all those levels.
[03:00.640 --> 03:10.240]  What they call stay-behind networks or embeds. So that is all coming up here tonight. We will
[03:10.240 --> 03:18.400]  break it down. The country and the entire world is in really unparalleled peril. And I do not
[03:18.400 --> 03:22.880]  have words to describe to you how serious the situation is. They've done everything they can
[03:22.880 --> 03:26.720]  to try to take us off air at this time. We're still on hundreds of radio stations,
[03:26.720 --> 03:33.200]  over 100 cable and TV stations, and we have huge audiences at man.video and in full wars.com and
[03:33.200 --> 03:39.840]  news wars.com. But remember, you are critical in this fight without you taking action and getting
[03:39.840 --> 03:45.200]  excited and telling people via email, your text message, your word of mouth about man.video,
[03:45.200 --> 03:51.280]  about info wars.com, forward slash show without you telling them that all the doctors and scientists
[03:51.280 --> 03:57.680]  and whistleblowers that have been exposing the COVID-19 takeover hoax. Without you getting that
[03:57.680 --> 04:02.560]  information out, we're going to lose this fight. And I've got some incredible examples of that.
[04:03.360 --> 04:08.240]  Eric Boling is going to be back on the show soon. He, of course, left Fox. The left celebrated it
[04:08.240 --> 04:15.200]  when the sun overdosed on an opiate. He's a good guy. He was doing a report for Sinclair. It's
[04:15.200 --> 04:19.680]  as big as Fox or bigger around the country with broadcast stations about gain of function and
[04:19.680 --> 04:26.400]  how Fauci was involved with the Wuhan lab weaponizing all of it. You know, I personally have
[04:26.400 --> 04:31.360]  sent him and Tucker Carlson and a bunch of other people hundreds of articles. I'll show you some
[04:31.360 --> 04:36.880]  of them today. Hell from the NIH website, how Fauci did this. It's not even hidden, but CNN's
[04:36.880 --> 04:42.240]  policing it and they, they, they made some calls and Sinclair is not going to air it now because,
[04:42.240 --> 04:47.680]  you know, Fauci's God, everything he says is a lie, a fraud. He threw in the first pitch at a
[04:47.680 --> 04:54.240]  baseball game was like 30 feet off the mound in left field. I mean, they all cheered for him.
[04:54.240 --> 04:57.440]  I mean, the guy is a fricking criminal who needs to be indicted.
[05:00.880 --> 05:06.240]  The reasons that the globalist launch this planetary lockdown. The number one reason is it
[05:06.240 --> 05:12.960]  serves every one of their purposes. We've gone over those purposes many times here on air.
[05:12.960 --> 05:17.520]  The casual society, the surveillance system, global government, medical tyranny, forced
[05:17.520 --> 05:23.840]  inoculation. But the most important facet is it teaches us that we are obsolete, that we are
[05:24.480 --> 05:32.160]  non-essential as we begin to witness automation computers and robots take over the jobs that
[05:32.160 --> 05:38.960]  people once had by design. This isn't like it's some advancement that we just fell into.
[05:38.960 --> 05:44.960]  It's been preplanned, organized globally, and it's extremely predatory. And through governmental
[05:44.960 --> 05:51.760]  actuaries and tax programs and regulations, the central banks that control it all are able to
[05:51.760 --> 06:17.760]  pick the winners and the losers and consolidate power. This is the truest form of technocracy fascism.
[06:17.760 --> 06:25.680]  Thank you so much for joining us on this July 26 Sunday live broadcast, 99 days out from this
[06:25.680 --> 06:30.560]  historic election. Well, I have here in my hands, again, I'm your host Alex Jones. Thank you for
[06:30.560 --> 06:38.880]  joining us. Seeing in the police dogs of thought crime, Sinclair says it will postpone and rework
[06:38.880 --> 06:46.880]  segment featuring conspiracy theory about Fauci. And it says that without any proof, though they
[06:46.880 --> 06:54.640]  don't show the piece, they were going to look at Fauci at the NIH for 45 years involved in
[06:54.640 --> 07:02.720]  gain of function transfers of weaponized coronavirus during the Obama administration.
[07:04.160 --> 07:06.880]  Now document cam shot, please look right here.
[07:06.880 --> 07:19.200]  NIH lifts funding pause on gain of function research NIH.gov. That's it. And it gets into Fauci
[07:19.200 --> 07:24.960]  and the programs and bill them on the gates and the actual gain of function. Here's Newsweek.
[07:24.960 --> 07:30.240]  Dr. Fauci back controversial Luhain lab with US dollars for risky coronavirus research
[07:30.240 --> 07:39.920]  with spliced virus chimeras using weaponized bat viruses. Oh, okay. Here's another one 2015 lab
[07:39.920 --> 07:47.040]  made coronavirus triggers debate gain of function weaponized SARS COVID-2 virus.
[07:48.640 --> 07:54.720]  And it goes into how deadly it is to transfer it. I'll be getting into that a little bit later.
[07:54.720 --> 08:04.080]  The emperor has no clothes. Everything Fauci has told us has been a giant galactic size lie.
[08:04.720 --> 08:10.480]  He told us 2.5 million would be dead in America, then 2.2 million. Then he told us all the hospitals
[08:10.480 --> 08:16.960]  would be full and we needed hundreds of thousands of ventilators. And now as they test everybody,
[08:16.960 --> 08:20.560]  the number of positives goes up, the number of deaths goes down, but they put out deceptive
[08:20.560 --> 08:25.520]  headlines saying record deaths. Then they'll say, Oh, because it's some little town had three deaths.
[08:25.520 --> 08:29.760]  They didn't have any before. So now it's record deaths. They're all playing semantical
[08:30.960 --> 08:36.720]  games. And Greg race did an excellent report that we're going to air coming up at the bottom
[08:36.720 --> 08:43.280]  of the hour where he shows the NIH website currently admitting that if you've ever had
[08:43.280 --> 08:49.200]  a bacterial infection, I didn't know that they've added that or a coronavirus. That's the common
[08:49.200 --> 08:55.680]  cold or the flu. Usually in about a decade, you will test positive for COVID-19. So when you
[08:55.680 --> 09:05.840]  see stories about their 60% false positives bull, you know what? Unbelievable fraud because it was
[09:05.840 --> 09:13.200]  the Wuhan lab that had a billable under gates finance directive in it that created the test
[09:13.200 --> 09:20.320]  that was then approved seven months ago in China that we then adopted. Look it up.
[09:22.080 --> 09:28.720]  Unbelievable. And medical doctors are trying to write books and publish them and Amazon won't
[09:28.720 --> 09:35.040]  even let them sell them. But it's all NIH. It's all admit that's what's crazy is none of this is even
[09:35.040 --> 09:47.600]  hidden. I just showed you new scientist. I just showed you NIH. I just showed you Newsweek saying
[09:47.600 --> 09:54.400]  Fauci ran the programs with Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation grants from them to the NIH
[09:54.400 --> 10:05.040]  and then given to the Wuhan lab in the hundreds of millions of dollars illegal gain of function weaponized
[10:05.040 --> 10:12.000]  testing that they shipped to China to do it there. Just like the CIA has black torture sites in China
[10:12.000 --> 10:20.560]  under Obama. But then Sinclair, bigger than Fox, thousands of TV stations around the country,
[10:20.560 --> 10:33.200]  tried to air it CNN tattled. And so now they're not going to do it right now. This is how crazy
[10:33.200 --> 10:38.880]  this is. It's like a very bowling wanted to have a thing on Sinclair saying Santa Claus has a big
[10:38.880 --> 10:45.200]  white beard and Santa Claus wears a red and white outfit. He's a jolly old elf. They say, oh,
[10:45.200 --> 10:53.040]  you can't talk about that. Santa Claus wears a green outfit. It's unbelievable fraud. Let me
[10:53.040 --> 11:10.560]  just stop there. Let me just stop there. The very same criminal groups that have brought you the
[11:10.560 --> 11:17.360]  overblown hoax of COVID-19, the very same groups that are telling us that we can never reopen the
[11:17.360 --> 11:29.840]  country again, but China's wide open are the same ones telling you that every day when black lives
[11:29.840 --> 11:36.880]  matter and anti for shoot up innocent people's cars, in many cases, brain damaging them and killing
[11:36.880 --> 11:45.040]  them, a whole bunch of deaths last three days, that that's peaceful while simultaneously saying
[11:45.040 --> 11:50.720]  we're going to burn the country down if Trump gets reelected in Atlantic monthly. Oh, and we're
[11:50.720 --> 11:55.360]  going to use the military to take Trump out if we challenge the election and he doesn't bow to that.
[11:56.880 --> 12:04.880]  I've got a bunch of compilations of people being shot and shot at when we come back.
[12:04.880 --> 12:09.600]  And I'm going to go over for radio lessons and narrate it, but you have to understand
[12:11.280 --> 12:19.680]  that this is systematic, terroristic activity being done to bring this nation to its knees
[12:19.680 --> 12:23.600]  and intimidate Americans. And people say, well, Americans won't be intimidated. This will backfire,
[12:23.600 --> 12:31.200]  really? Public schools and colleges all over the country, if you try to say man or woman on the
[12:31.200 --> 12:37.280]  entrance form will throw you out. We live in a cult. Look at political correctness.
[12:41.040 --> 12:47.200]  On YouTube, they get strikes on famous chess channels if white night takes black pawn because
[12:47.200 --> 12:51.920]  that could be seen as racist. I was telling the lawyer that he didn't believe me. He pulled it
[12:51.920 --> 13:00.560]  up and his mouth fell open. That's the level of the cult and we've bowed to them so much
[13:00.560 --> 13:09.440]  for so long, they think we're going to bow to them again and forever. But one young man last
[13:09.440 --> 13:14.880]  night in Austin thought that too, and we'll play that when we come back. He's got his AK-47.
[13:14.880 --> 13:20.400]  He's too ignorant to know that it's actually like a Mac 90. It's a semi-auto. And he says,
[13:20.400 --> 13:25.120]  you know, I'd like to kill some police or, you know, have I killed cops will kill me. So we'll
[13:25.120 --> 13:29.920]  see. He goes, none of these people out here that we're going to be menacing or threatening have
[13:29.920 --> 13:35.920]  got any balls. And so he said, well, you'll see what he said when we come back, we'll play that
[13:35.920 --> 13:42.240]  first. And then he runs out into traffic and blocks people's cars and the witness to say he
[13:42.240 --> 13:46.000]  raised the gun. And there's video of him raising it up towards the window. And then you hear what
[13:46.000 --> 13:51.200]  sounds like rifle shots and then handgun shots. And some journalists are saying that that's why
[13:51.200 --> 13:54.880]  the news is being suppressed. What happened because it looks like there's like a Somali
[13:54.880 --> 13:58.880]  in Seattle drove through. They were running around on the road at night. He hit two women.
[13:58.880 --> 14:02.560]  They wanted to say it was a white supremacist for days. They wouldn't say what color he was.
[14:02.560 --> 14:06.320]  There was a Somali guy that just got on the highway and people ran out in front of him at night.
[14:07.920 --> 14:12.080]  Then you saw that story go away. But the point is, is that
[14:14.320 --> 14:18.560]  you heard, oh, white supremacist attacked somebody for no reason in Austin last night.
[14:18.560 --> 14:22.720]  And then we've got all this footage of BLM, mainly white people
[14:22.720 --> 14:29.600]  and Antifa all over the country running out in roads and just shooting at vehicles.
[14:31.040 --> 14:35.600]  Or running up, but I kept saying, man, in a lot of areas of Texas, you run up and surround somebody's
[14:35.600 --> 14:41.040]  car and then point a rifle at them. It's not going to go well, but that's why
[14:41.760 --> 14:46.240]  the orders from Soros have come down in places like St. Louis with the McCluskey family,
[14:46.240 --> 14:49.760]  where they broke down their gate, came on their yard, were threatening to kill them.
[14:49.760 --> 14:54.720]  It's on the video. They pointed guns at them. One of them was a prop. They were lawyers.
[14:54.720 --> 14:56.240]  It was a prop from a case they had.
[14:59.520 --> 15:03.680]  And they swat teamed them. Now they've indicted them because they want the message that when we
[15:03.680 --> 15:09.600]  come to burn your house, you bow down and don't fight back so the riots can get steam and really
[15:09.600 --> 15:13.840]  burn down the country because they want the citizens to stand down and the police to stand
[15:13.840 --> 15:18.080]  down so they can take full control of all the government buildings, just like the Bolsheviks
[15:18.080 --> 15:25.200]  did in 1917 and refuse fascism and all the Soros funded groups admit that's their plan.
[15:25.200 --> 15:30.800]  And they just overthrew Ukraine five years ago with the very same groups and the very same tactics.
[15:33.360 --> 15:37.120]  And now Atlantic Monthly and others are saying, and remember what Maxine Water said,
[15:37.120 --> 15:41.040]  confront these people everywhere, attack them everywhere. And now they've gone to the head
[15:41.040 --> 15:46.960]  of DHS's house and they're threatening him because that's what they do. They went to
[15:46.960 --> 15:50.960]  Mitch McConnell's house and said, we're going to murder you. When Mitch said it was wrong,
[15:50.960 --> 15:55.440]  Twitter censored him and Mitch McConnell thanked Twittering on his knees. So you're
[15:55.440 --> 15:57.280]  capitulating is asking for this.
[15:59.680 --> 16:04.960]  Storeable food is again available for shipping within three to four weeks. We have it. It's
[16:04.960 --> 16:09.360]  high quality, but it's got to be packaged and shipped out to you. Some items are shipping in

[16:25.520 --> 16:30.480]  really, really serious times are ahead, whether Trump wins or loses. The globalists have already
[16:30.480 --> 16:35.360]  created a worldwide depression, lockdowns on the planetary scale, and it's only intensifying.
[16:35.360 --> 16:39.040]  This is one of the big boxes. You've got to get checked off. It's high quality,

[16:58.240 --> 17:04.640]  forestore.com. There are a lot of reasons to get an Alex Jones plastic mask at infowarstore.com.
[17:04.640 --> 17:08.640]  You can wear them out to political events. You can trigger live darts. One of the biggest
[17:08.640 --> 17:16.720]  reasons is it's a great conversation starter at any costume party or at Halloween. But on top of that,
[17:16.720 --> 17:20.560]  they admit that wearing these masks does absolutely nothing to protect you from COVID-19
[17:20.560 --> 17:24.480]  or anything else. It's total virtues signaling to show that you're prepared for the force
[17:24.480 --> 17:29.840]  inoculations and contact tracing of their openly announcing. It's an active submission.
[17:29.840 --> 17:34.640]  It's an active like putting a burqa on your head and bowing down. But a big reason to wear these
[17:34.640 --> 17:40.000]  is then into stores when people ask you why you're wearing a Halloween mask say it's just as useless.
[17:40.000 --> 17:46.000]  That's the stupid cloth mask that you're wearing. And the M95 mask only control what's coming in,
[17:46.000 --> 17:50.720]  not what's going out. So they quote spread COVID-19. They don't protect from it. So again,
[17:50.720 --> 17:55.360]  it's a great way to throw it back in these control free spaces. You buy one for 9.95. You get four
[17:55.360 --> 18:02.880]  more free. They're at cost infowarstore.com. The bad news is Western governments have totally
[18:02.880 --> 18:09.280]  let multinational big tech bring in communist Chinese style total net surveillance censorship
[18:09.280 --> 18:15.120]  with AI. The good news is they had to do that to carry out this world government COVID takeover.
[18:15.680 --> 18:21.680]  This planetary corporate reset that COVID covers for because the truth is powerful and
[18:21.680 --> 18:28.320]  will defeat them and will smash them. And the good news is there's still sites like band.video,
[18:28.320 --> 18:35.120]  news wars.com, info wars.com, Paul Watson site summit.news and a lot of other great sites that
[18:35.120 --> 18:42.000]  are getting massive traffic. Thanks to you and your word of mouth that is king, that is queen,
[18:42.000 --> 18:48.160]  that is the master of our own destinies. Ladies and gentlemen, there is a war on reality,
[18:48.160 --> 18:54.000]  a war on civilization, a war on our health, a war on our economy, but being aware of it and
[18:54.000 --> 18:59.280]  standing up to it and speaking out against it will defeat it. So take action or be slaves.
[19:00.720 --> 19:09.040]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy and overall wellness.

[19:59.520 --> 20:15.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:23.920 --> 20:29.040]  The social engineers, the globalists and their bought and paid for corporate media
[20:29.040 --> 20:32.880]  that's back on the chai comms and every other America hating institution
[20:34.240 --> 20:38.960]  are counting on sucker punching the American people. But I've been reading the Council on
[20:38.960 --> 20:43.280]  Fine Relations reports and tracking them since Trump got elected and they talked about
[20:43.280 --> 20:49.040]  triggering nationwide riots, calling it racial and then using that as the pretext to have a
[20:49.040 --> 20:54.000]  coup against the president and then they think everybody will just sit down in fear and accept
[20:54.000 --> 20:58.720]  it but they need a lockdown in place first and that's what they're using the virus for so you're
[20:58.720 --> 21:04.000]  used to being told stay in your home, do what we say. We've already put you into that artificial
[21:04.000 --> 21:08.080]  martial law. So here's the headline of the live show today. I hope you'll share it. That's how
[21:08.080 --> 21:13.040]  we reach new people and stop this. Red Alert, Deep State Dems have already launched a violent plan
[21:13.040 --> 21:18.320]  to overthrow the U.S. government. Now let me show you some news articles that I'm going to play the
[21:18.320 --> 21:23.600]  clips proving it all. Schiff, Trump will refuse to accept election results and allow peaceful
[21:23.600 --> 21:28.320]  transition though they're the ones gearing up for total violence now with people being killed
[21:28.320 --> 21:33.600]  every couple hours and the media and lockstep covering it up. Leftist MAG issues threat,
[21:33.600 --> 21:37.680]  violence and riots will skyrocket if Trump wins election. That's Atlantic Monthly.
[21:38.240 --> 21:42.560]  Black Trump supporter executed in broad daylight for holding up a Trump sign in Wisconsin.
[21:42.560 --> 21:48.800]  Leftist pledge, anyone supporting Trump will be murdered. All they want to do is condemn law
[21:48.800 --> 21:54.080]  enforcement. DHS Secretary Chad Wolf blasts Democrats on Fox News. They come to his house,
[21:54.080 --> 22:00.000]  threaten to kill him. That's right, townhall.com. Meanwhile, Portland rioters occupy exterior
[22:00.000 --> 22:04.720]  federal courthouse, raise American flag upside down because they're inverting it. It's actually
[22:04.720 --> 22:11.680]  true the country is in crisis. That's coming up. Radio host mocks Trump by claiming Seattle's peaceful
[22:11.680 --> 22:18.560]  then rioters burn down his apartment building. Video Colorado BLM protestor shoots fellow
[22:18.560 --> 22:22.880]  demonstrator while aiming at a car that's sped through the crowd. They just ride on the highway
[22:22.880 --> 22:27.280]  trying to be hit. And then glass them a Somali hit them so they couldn't say white supremacist.
[22:27.280 --> 22:29.520]  The guy didn't know what was happening. He's ran on front of him at night.
[22:30.320 --> 22:34.960]  Protestor rub across country. Black militia member accidentally shoots comrades in parks.
[22:34.960 --> 22:40.000]  Properly blames white supremacism. Black Lives Matter activists have their toddlers carry
[22:40.000 --> 22:45.120]  F the police signs and use them as human shields. Black conservatives stabbed by
[22:45.120 --> 22:49.120]  Antibody during Portland Black Lives Matter riots. Shocking video. We're going to play all
[22:49.120 --> 22:56.160]  this next segment. And the flag upside down. Austin protester allegedly armed with AK-47.
[22:56.160 --> 23:00.320]  I don't know why it says allegedly. I mean, he said he had an AK-47. It was a semi-automatic
[23:00.320 --> 23:05.280]  version of that shot by a driver while blocking traffic and approaching vehicle.
[23:06.160 --> 23:11.360]  We're going to get to that first right now. Listen to what by the way,
[23:11.360 --> 23:15.840]  look at this guy's background. You talk about a creep. I'm just going to leave it at that.
[23:15.840 --> 23:23.600]  You talk about bizarre and stupid. LARPing out at night blocking traffic with a gunpoint and
[23:23.600 --> 23:27.840]  it's somebody's a threat. People have a right to defend themselves. But this individual,
[23:27.840 --> 23:31.840]  he's got his name, all the information's on him. Full wars.com. Here's what he said about
[23:31.840 --> 23:37.680]  10 minutes before he ran out with a mob to stop cars, pointed his gun reportedly at somebody and
[23:37.680 --> 23:46.640]  got shot. Here it is.
[23:47.920 --> 23:54.640]  They don't let us march in the streets anymore. So I've got to practice some of our rights.
[23:54.640 --> 23:57.680]  Do you feel like you'll need to use it?
[23:57.680 --> 24:06.320]  No. I think the, I mean, if I use it against the cops, I'm dead. And I think all the people that
[24:06.320 --> 24:13.520]  hate us and, you know, want to say too big of a pussy to stop and actually do anything about it.
[24:14.960 --> 24:16.080]  Why'd you start carrying?
[24:16.800 --> 24:19.840]  Well, our roommate got arrested and they stopped letting us march anywhere.
[24:25.360 --> 24:31.520]  You're a great virtue to say. So talk about killing cops and what happens just a few minutes
[24:31.520 --> 24:36.880]  later because everybody's whips. So you run up and the photos are on infowars.com and the
[24:36.880 --> 24:41.200]  article about it. We have screenshots of it and he's there with the rifle up pointing at somebody
[24:41.200 --> 24:46.080]  and well, you pointed a gun at somebody, their son for no reason. But you hear in the video,
[24:46.080 --> 24:51.120]  it sounds like he's shooting first. You hear a rifle shoot, then you hear three shots return
[24:51.120 --> 24:54.960]  that are muffled. And that's what experts are looking at the tape are saying. But of course,
[24:54.960 --> 24:59.360]  it'll be covered up by the leftist city of Austin if that is indeed the case. But regardless,
[24:59.360 --> 25:03.360]  run out in traffic, block somebody, point a gun at them. This is what happens. We have all these
[25:03.360 --> 25:08.800]  videos that just happened of them shooting at cars and actually shooting people. And when it
[25:08.800 --> 25:14.240]  happens, it's hardly on the news. It's a little blip on the radar screen that oh, peaceful protesters
[25:14.240 --> 25:22.720]  shot somebody else today. Here's one shock video. BLM Antifa rioter shoots driver trying to pass
[25:22.720 --> 25:29.120]  protest across the country black militia member accidentally shoots comrades in a park. And we're
[25:29.120 --> 25:41.040]  showing all this for TV viewers. Yeah, let's do this. Let's let's do this. Let's start over.
[25:41.040 --> 25:45.760]  Let's start over to the beginning and let's roll compilation clip.
[25:45.760 --> 25:55.040]  Compilation clip. One place. Here it is. So guys drive down the road and they just shoot at him.
[25:56.000 --> 25:59.840]  There's your peaceful. Soros folks. Now here's Kentucky yesterday.
[26:03.200 --> 26:04.720]  And they just fire a shotgun at people.
[26:08.960 --> 26:13.760]  And they tell everybody to get down. And these folks are also video
[26:13.760 --> 26:17.920]  ones been shot coming up to random cars and saying I'll kill you to white people.
[26:18.960 --> 26:24.320]  Here's some more BLM mainly white trendies in Aurora, Colorado. There's there's chopper footage.
[26:24.320 --> 26:28.240]  They just run out on the highway and the car doesn't know what to do. So they shoot at it.
[26:29.520 --> 26:38.160]  Here's the Austin protester with his AK-47 who runs out. And again, we've got paused still
[26:38.160 --> 26:44.320]  shots on info wars.com from the video showing him when the rifle up to the window of the car
[26:44.320 --> 26:48.960]  with people beating on it screaming going, he's white. He's white trying to pull the white person
[26:48.960 --> 26:53.520]  out. And it's white people mainly saying and doing it. It's like when age three looks famously yells
[26:53.520 --> 26:57.680]  it. Oh, and Shroyard says, you have a right to speak. You're an ethnic white male.
[26:59.520 --> 27:04.400]  That's the craziness of you're just downtown Austin driving. And there are people with guns and
[27:04.400 --> 27:09.200]  hatchets and hammers and they've attacked us with hammers. And the media goes, well, Jones deserves
[27:09.200 --> 27:17.840]  it. This is peaceful. And all these armshare leftists like the mayor of Portland went out to support
[27:17.840 --> 27:23.440]  them burning down the courthouse. And then they attack him because he's an old white dude. They
[27:23.440 --> 27:29.040]  go, look, he's white. They don't even know he's the mayor under Soros commanding them.
[27:29.040 --> 27:36.320]  They don't even know he's their general come to praise them while they pull down the American flag
[27:36.320 --> 27:41.680]  and hoist it upside down. Not even knowing they put up the right symbol that America is in grave
[27:41.680 --> 27:47.760]  distress and is in grave crisis. We're going to go to break and I'm going to come back and go through
[27:47.760 --> 27:54.720]  more videos and individual videos of them shooting people in the head with pleasure. You're just
[27:54.720 --> 28:01.600]  driving your truck. They run out in front of you. Yeah, here's Utah right here. And boom,
[28:01.600 --> 28:06.720]  and we've got Colorado, another Colorado. Oh, wait, there's more. Not just yesterday's Colorado.
[28:06.720 --> 28:12.240]  We have another Colorado where they shoot the man. Last time I heard he's in critical condition,
[28:12.240 --> 28:19.760]  brain dead. And it was a liberal white lawyer did it. And he in his mug shot, he's so proud
[28:19.760 --> 28:26.080]  of what he did. He shot a Nazi. And by the way, when they shot him in the head, he drove a few
[28:26.080 --> 28:32.080]  blocks and passed out. They went to the police and said a white supremacist attacked us. Oh,
[28:32.080 --> 28:37.680]  yes, yes. That's what happens when they run and jump on your car right out of the highway in front
[28:37.680 --> 28:42.720]  of a Somali. Oh, look, there's a car going 80. We run after a few people. You know, one lady gets
[28:42.720 --> 28:47.280]  killed. Other one almost says they're like white supremacist, white supremacist, white supremacist.
[28:47.280 --> 28:51.040]  They're trying to drag it on the car. They go, wait, it's black. And still they cover it up. They go,
[28:51.040 --> 29:04.160]  white supremacist, white supremacist. Imagine telling someone just a year ago that in the middle
[29:04.160 --> 29:10.000]  of 2020, the Democrats as well as many Republican leaders would be calling for the United Nations
[29:10.000 --> 29:18.880]  WHO edict that all Americans wear masks, be a quote, federal order and mandate. Totally
[29:18.880 --> 29:25.840]  unconstitutional, annihilating states rights. Think about that. A woman can kill her baby.
[29:25.840 --> 29:32.480]  We pay for illegal aliens health care. But you've got to wear a mask for a virus that killed 20
[29:32.480 --> 29:38.640]  plus times less than what they said, even if you believe the official story. This is about the WHO,
[29:38.640 --> 29:44.960]  the globalists testing their power through the media over the federal government to set policy
[29:44.960 --> 29:49.680]  in the United States. This is our punishment for not going with the carbon taxes and the
[29:49.680 --> 29:55.520]  Paris Accord and all of it. And by the way, they admit that they say now your carbon's down one
[29:55.520 --> 30:03.360]  way or another, you stupid Americans. There are a lot of signs that people are really waking up
[30:03.360 --> 30:08.240]  to the new world order in global government. But one of the biggest is privacy pouches.
[30:08.240 --> 30:13.280]  I've been selling these for more than 10 years. In the old days, they weren't 100% effective.
[30:13.280 --> 30:18.800]  Now they are their little bitty lightweight Faraday cages that small phones and even large cell
[30:18.800 --> 30:23.040]  phones fit into very, very comfortably and then slip right into your pocket. And these things
[30:23.040 --> 30:27.360]  work great that way. You're not tracked. You're not traced by government, by big corporations,
[30:27.360 --> 30:32.560]  by big tech, by hackers, by criminals. They're selling your data. They're using it against you.
[30:32.560 --> 30:37.600]  AI uses this to be able to predict the future manipulate markets. It's critical that everyone
[30:37.600 --> 30:41.520]  stop going around with your cell phones being naked. Well, I gotta tell you, normally we probably
[30:41.520 --> 30:46.480]  sold a couple hundred a month. We're selling upwards of a thousand of these a day. Plus,
[30:46.480 --> 30:49.920]  we have a good unit and it's also a good price. We have it in four different colors.
[30:49.920 --> 30:55.200]  It's the privacy pockets at infowarstore.com. People are really waking up. I'm seeing it all over
[30:55.200 --> 31:08.240]  the news that folks are aware of this and are now using these. Get yours at infowarstore.com.

[32:03.680 --> 32:11.280]  media fake news outlets came out and said that a new Trump campaign t-shirt that has an American
[32:11.280 --> 32:17.600]  eagle spreading its wings standing on top of an American flag is Nazi and they had the Soros
[32:17.600 --> 32:23.120]  funded Snopes groups and others fact checking to say yes now the American flag and yes the
[32:23.120 --> 32:28.800]  American eagle are Nazis. No, George Soros that funds Snopes media matters and the rest of them
[32:28.800 --> 32:34.000]  he's the real Nazi collaborator. But this shirt I think is really the perfect campaign
[32:34.000 --> 32:38.320]  shirts. We make one even better than what Trump's people came up with. Two different versions of it
[32:38.320 --> 32:44.320]  with something even worse the Betsy Ross flag or first flag that they also say is racist even
[32:44.320 --> 32:50.160]  though she was a famous abolitionist. So these shirts are infowars.com. They're the American eagle
[32:50.160 --> 32:55.280]  Betsy Ross flags. Two different designs guaranteed to spread the word and of course trigger lift
[32:55.280 --> 32:59.440]  hearts everywhere. Exercise your first amendment or lose it infowarstore.com
[32:59.440 --> 33:22.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show another time in the age of wonder

[33:38.320 --> 33:42.320]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[33:42.960 --> 33:49.040]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[33:51.280 --> 33:54.720]  power of our source is the truth and it will prevail
[33:54.720 --> 34:02.720]  all right anybody can just type into a search engine Virginia gun rally ends peacefully
[34:02.720 --> 34:08.000]  mother Jones ad would met it the Associated Press ad would met it the state police estimated 28,000
[34:08.000 --> 34:14.720]  I estimated about 40,000 people a white black Hispanic Asian old young all came out together
[34:16.960 --> 34:20.800]  even though they closed half the capital ground so it wouldn't look like a big crowd they filled
[34:20.800 --> 34:26.560]  five six seven eight nine streets in all directions it was amazing one arrest of somebody getting
[34:26.560 --> 34:34.160]  an officified who was the leftist and it totally freaked the globalist out and now they gave you
[34:34.160 --> 34:38.960]  COVID-19 and they say conservatives aren't allowed to have demonstrations but the left of the
[34:38.960 --> 34:44.800]  communists they can go out and burn an attack and do what they want so no one hurt incredibly
[34:44.800 --> 34:50.880]  safe the left scared to death meanwhile there are so many stabbings and shootings and murders
[34:50.880 --> 34:58.400]  every day of white people at the hands of whites and blacks saying they deserve because they're
[34:58.400 --> 35:03.280]  white and there are black people that are Trump supporters being murdered another man shot multiple
[35:03.280 --> 35:07.840]  times were holding up a Trump sign in Milwaukee and trying to talk to crowds of people and folks
[35:07.840 --> 35:12.880]  thought Trump was so bad they went and they killed him and left us in the news saying bring in the
[35:12.880 --> 35:19.360]  federal troops we're ready to kill you and there are people on twitter saying we're going to get
[35:19.360 --> 35:25.520]  jones bounties for jones publicly who are real people even though that's a soliciting murder

[37:57.040 --> 38:00.800]  oh later how we burned in the camps wishing we could have done something
[38:00.800 --> 38:06.640]  at the beginning when they started coming for us well i'm doing everything i can in the information
[38:06.640 --> 38:13.040]  war to shape the battle space to fix this peacefully but if it's war they've been looking for it's
[38:13.040 --> 38:18.160]  war they're gonna get and you make sure folks that you don't follow the medias programming
[38:18.160 --> 38:21.520]  as they have a real civil war breaks out which we're already in the early stages of now they're
[38:21.520 --> 38:26.480]  igniting it you don't go fight antifa trash and people in downtown with morons brainwashed
[38:27.680 --> 38:33.440]  it's who sent them and they want to come to our houses
[38:38.640 --> 38:43.040]  that's why all the real establishment are on private islands hiding out right now saying
[38:43.040 --> 38:48.640]  for covet they're not hiding out from covet they're all in new zealand because this is their

[43:23.360 --> 43:29.360]  and at fuller store dot com i got the idea from the trump campaign having a similar shirt to be
[43:29.360 --> 43:33.920]  called nazi which of course it isn't and since it's so triggering to the leftist and globalist
[43:33.920 --> 43:38.080]  well we're going to make sure there's even more of these on the streets to spread the word and

[44:08.640 --> 44:14.320]  but big tech large corporations hackers governments foreign governments the chai comms especially
[44:14.320 --> 44:20.400]  are using this to steal your data to share your data to be able to rig markets when they're able
[44:20.400 --> 44:25.440]  to scoop up billions of people's data they can actually predict on record what's going to happen
[44:25.440 --> 44:33.520]  in mass movements cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their ai takeover
[44:33.520 --> 44:38.000]  in their own words they admit it so i've been selling privacy pouches and block and pockets
[44:38.000 --> 44:41.840]  and things like that for more than a decade and now the units have gotten really lightweight

[45:16.240 --> 45:20.560]  private property because we've had it so long and we just think that's how the rest of the world is
[45:20.560 --> 45:26.000]  ladies and gentlemen the renaissance the social contract that's 500 years old to try to build

[45:31.040 --> 45:35.920]  is something the west invented and that's what made our modern world that's now been hijacked
[45:35.920 --> 45:40.400]  by the technocrats by the globalists who say humans are ugly and bad for the earth and we
[45:40.400 --> 45:46.480]  need to be cold and dumbed down and put into subgroups that the elites dominate manipulate
[45:46.480 --> 45:51.920]  and command you're even lucky enough to stay alive and that's what covet 19 is a global

[46:14.560 --> 46:20.800]  gets what jobs but in reality it's building a post human world so that you can be made obsolete
[46:21.520 --> 46:30.960]  domesticated dumbed down drugged distracted atomized and then slowly killed this is the brave
[46:30.960 --> 46:37.440]  new world it's the post human world it's the dreaming of the post human world the wired
[46:37.440 --> 46:42.560]  magazine and the wall street journal all tell us about it oh now they tell us our smart phones
[46:42.560 --> 46:47.920]  don't just tracker every move they're monitoring our psychology and sending it back to a corporate
[46:47.920 --> 46:55.120]  database globally you see the bear trap closed on our leg now and the vampire walked out of the
[46:55.120 --> 47:04.480]  bushes and is explaining to us how we slowly gonna bleed us and destroy us you're listening to the
[47:04.480 --> 47:24.480]  alex jones show the civil war isn't coming the civil war is here and it's run by the
[47:24.480 --> 47:29.360]  chycoms the e you the globalist hollywood the democratic party and all the big banks
[47:29.360 --> 47:35.920]  and that's why all the corporations line up and beg because they want that free fiat money
[47:35.920 --> 47:41.200]  the central banks give them that's backed up by who by you and i the taxpayers
[47:42.640 --> 47:48.480]  that's how it's all centralized how the un runs our medicine how the un runs our schools
[47:48.480 --> 47:54.960]  how all this regulations control us who set up the u n the rogofellers on record
[47:54.960 --> 48:07.280]  a giant spider web a new world order a big idea a post human future but to build that
[48:07.280 --> 48:13.840]  nightmare world the renaissance and the liberal west must be pulled down no better way to destroy
[48:13.840 --> 48:20.240]  true liberalism than to bring in the left hand path and destroy free open societies that's why
[48:20.240 --> 48:26.560]  soros captains the open society everything with him is an inversion it's the closed society the
[48:26.560 --> 48:35.920]  poor society the society under his and other globalist iron rule because they want to dominate
[48:35.920 --> 48:42.800]  your soul they want you to beg for every crime they want you to submit to them because they're
[48:42.800 --> 48:50.800]  falling and ugly and want you to be beneath them you will never be beneath remember that now let's
[48:50.800 --> 48:55.520]  get into it i have countless more videos but why don't we just show the video the radio
[48:55.520 --> 49:00.880]  listeners a few weeks ago white supremacist runs over peaceful protesters that had run out on the
[49:00.880 --> 49:07.840]  highway blocked it in a dark area of the road two women two white women live streaming get run over
[49:07.840 --> 49:12.720]  they run to attack the guy sort of beating his car he drives off they call it a hit and run
[49:13.440 --> 49:17.600]  until they find out it's a black guy and then the whole story got shut down
[49:19.920 --> 49:25.280]  but that's what happens here ladies and gentlemen when you're out on the highway at 130 and somebody
[49:25.280 --> 49:28.880]  that's been out partying comes driving on the road and boy that had been a white guy
[49:31.360 --> 49:34.480]  and we'd have pointed out you know that it was an accident i'd have been sued
[49:34.480 --> 49:41.040]  by university right there in seattle just like i was by georgetown for pointing out that soros
[49:41.040 --> 49:46.640]  collided all the people together a few years ago in virginia to create a crisis and one woman got
[49:46.640 --> 49:51.440]  killed they're suing me saying i'm saying they actually killed the woman physically themselves
[49:51.440 --> 49:56.080]  no i said like a chemistry set you set up the collision and then had the police push them
[49:56.080 --> 50:01.680]  together for the crisis and the democrats are now on record saying in the news we're going to create
[50:01.680 --> 50:08.000]  explosions all over the u.s to drive trump from power and they've bought full page ads in the new
[50:08.000 --> 50:17.600]  york times while they simultaneously have front line coming out with a multi-series show of complete
[50:17.600 --> 50:21.760]  fiction because i've talked to people that have been involved in the production
[50:21.760 --> 50:27.440]  unbelievable they're actually going to say i'm told that russians fund info wars
[50:27.440 --> 50:32.560]  i wonder how much they had to pay people to say that look at this headline united states of conspiracy
[50:32.560 --> 50:42.880]  examines how three men alex jones roger stone and president trump helped to lay the foundation for
[50:42.880 --> 50:47.440]  the conspiracy theories to take center stage in america's national conversation
[50:47.440 --> 50:56.000]  and on the front page of their twitter front page of front line it's me at the evil
[50:57.840 --> 51:03.520]  austin rallies against compulsory mask how horrible we are
[51:06.640 --> 51:10.720]  here let's roll some footage of them a few weeks ago attacking armored vehicle while making jokes
[51:10.720 --> 51:14.480]  why do you have an armored vehicle well if we're going to go downtown and cover all this
[51:14.480 --> 51:20.640]  this and you're going to come up armed with clubs and hammers and guns and then try to batch
[51:20.640 --> 51:25.840]  the windows out we need to be able to peacefully show how violent people you are so the media spun
[51:25.840 --> 51:31.280]  this and said we attacked our own vehicle in a false flag and then the media said we put fake
[51:31.280 --> 51:38.080]  bullet holes in the window nose hammer holes they did it antifa and then they said that we burned
[51:38.080 --> 51:43.600]  down a homeless camp because antifa isn't violent that's right we burned a homeless camp because
[51:43.600 --> 51:52.720]  we shot the footage of them burning the homeless camp uh-huh talk about being conspiracy theorist
[51:52.720 --> 51:59.120]  ladies and gentlemen this is how they operate each and every time so schiff has now joined
[52:00.160 --> 52:04.480]  polosi and the former attorney general eric holder and all the rest of them
[52:04.480 --> 52:10.000]  joe biden saying trump is a dictator that these the the the federal police guarding
[52:10.000 --> 52:15.920]  courthouses are nazis why everybody's a nazi now except the real nazi collaborated towards soros
[52:18.880 --> 52:22.160]  i remember just six months ago they had articles going jones is insane
[52:22.160 --> 52:27.280]  george soros is a philanthropist he doesn't fund black lives matter or antifa now soros is proud
[52:27.280 --> 52:34.320]  of this he's like i am doubling my funding hundreds of millions of dollars a year to this
[52:34.320 --> 52:40.800]  200 million this year so far the black lives matter and antifa that we know of
[52:44.080 --> 52:52.720]  i'm being sued by a soros back suit and it says jones falsely claims that soros funded antifa
[52:52.720 --> 52:58.240]  in charlottesville and it's on the damn record in his own family name they gave the money
[52:58.240 --> 53:07.360]  i mean this is next level ladies but they don't care they don't care because they've got systems
[53:07.360 --> 53:13.360]  that will route us and they believe shut us down as if i can't jack into our awesome incredible
[53:13.360 --> 53:17.520]  supporters and listeners who are loyal to the truth and justice who will always amplify as long
[53:17.520 --> 53:22.720]  as they're alive our message and as they try to suppress our message it only becomes stronger
[53:22.720 --> 53:28.720]  historically the strizan effect is active now i'm going to give you some good news i'm gonna hit

[54:50.000 --> 54:55.040]  i and the civil russian but by doing that they make me an enemy and they could use cia money and
[54:55.040 --> 54:59.680]  propaganda to try to shut us down and sue us and do all this and trumps never gotten full control
[54:59.680 --> 55:04.960]  of the cog system and maybe he'll wake up now with 99 days left because polosi's on tv saying

[57:43.360 --> 57:47.840]  you are the baller there spread the word now do it tell folks tune in now
[57:49.600 --> 57:55.360]  there are a lot of reasons to get an alex jones plastic mask at infowarstore.com you can wear
[57:55.360 --> 57:59.840]  them out to political events you can trigger it live darts but one of the biggest reasons is
[57:59.840 --> 58:07.040]  it's a great conversation starter at any costume party or at halloween but on top of that they
[58:07.040 --> 58:11.120]  admit that wearing these masks does absolutely nothing to protect you from covid 19 or anything
[58:11.120 --> 58:15.760]  else it's total virtues signaling to show that you're prepared for the force inoculations and
[58:15.760 --> 58:21.040]  contact tracing of their openly announcing it's an act of submission it's an act of like putting
[58:21.040 --> 58:26.400]  a burqa on your head and bowing down but a big reason to wear these is then into stores when
[58:26.400 --> 58:31.280]  people ask you why you're wearing a halloween mask say it's just as useless as the stupid cloth
[58:31.280 --> 58:37.120]  mask that you're wearing and the m95 mask only control what's coming in not what's going out so
[58:37.120 --> 58:42.000]  they quote spread covid 19 they don't protect from it so again it's a great way to throw it back

[59:02.800 --> 59:09.840]  chelsea clinton on the board are in control with apple and google with a hidden app on all phones
[59:09.840 --> 59:14.880]  that you cannot turn off the track and trace everywhere you go they claim for covid but of
[59:14.880 --> 59:21.760]  course it's really the chinese communist social score rollout these people are sick filthy criminals
[59:21.760 --> 59:27.600]  and they want total control over society with the official global id system that's why it's called
[59:27.600 --> 59:33.760]  the clinton global initiative but you can fight back with the privacy pockets at infowarstore.com

[59:46.160 --> 59:49.440]  clinton's go to hell and get your privacy pockets and infowar store
[59:49.440 --> 59:55.840]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:00:04.240 --> 1:00:08.560]  folks we are back live thank you so much for joining us ted nujans can be calling in the
[1:00:08.560 --> 1:00:14.160]  next five minutes or so and if you just heard me mention oh the governor said they'll arrest
[1:00:14.160 --> 1:00:19.280]  ted newton and this congressman if they come to new york it blocks the quarantine but antifa can
[1:00:19.280 --> 1:00:26.000]  riot and attack police and so they cancelled a pro police rally and again you could go there and
[1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:30.160]  you know let let them come after ted newton the point is is that the organizer shut it down so
[1:00:30.160 --> 1:00:35.600]  so ted newton didn't go to it that's how the communists have us paralyzed and that's why the
[1:00:35.600 --> 1:00:40.400]  la mayor says oh it's good if you protest the police just no one else can you know protest though
[1:00:40.400 --> 1:00:45.200]  so anything else only communists are allowed to protest and they're all just teaching you
[1:00:45.200 --> 1:00:51.200]  these major contradictions this is done in psych warfare this is done to train you to accept
[1:00:51.200 --> 1:00:56.640]  garbage you're not supposed to like it you're supposed to learn to accept it that it's peaceful
[1:00:56.640 --> 1:01:03.040]  to run up to you in a car and shoot you in the head now here's a very powerful report before we go
[1:01:03.040 --> 1:01:07.680]  to ted newton since we're getting that greg reese put together called everyone will soon test positive
[1:01:07.680 --> 1:01:12.320]  for covet and it shows all the cdc documents we'll just see it for yourself this is beyond critical
[1:01:12.320 --> 1:01:21.680]  band-aid video we know that the prescribed pcr tests are not detecting the covet 19 genome
[1:01:22.320 --> 1:01:28.960]  according to the cdc's own literature the tests do not rule out bacterial infection
[1:01:28.960 --> 1:01:36.720]  or other viruses they are detecting all varieties of corona virus including the common cold and
[1:01:36.720 --> 1:01:44.000]  counting it as covet 19 and it has been pointed out for months that the geographical locations
[1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:52.880]  experiencing the most cases of covet also seem to have active 5g technology after a video went viral
[1:01:52.880 --> 1:01:59.120]  in which david icke suggested that 5g is somehow responsible for positive cases of covet 19
[1:01:59.120 --> 1:02:06.640]  youtube deleted it and began deleting all videos on the subject including a video we made that
[1:02:06.640 --> 1:02:15.760]  pointed out how on october 31st of 2019 wuhan china became the first major test bed of 5g technology
[1:02:18.240 --> 1:02:25.520]  in late june a new scientific research paper entitled 5g technology and induction of corona
[1:02:25.520 --> 1:02:32.640]  virus in skin cells was published this paper gives a scientific explanation of the relationship
[1:02:32.640 --> 1:02:42.400]  between 5g technology and the corona virus unlike 4g or other radio waves the 5g millimeter waves
[1:02:42.400 --> 1:02:51.360]  can penetrate the nucleus of a cell the dna then acts as an inductor it reacts to the 5g waves
[1:02:51.360 --> 1:02:58.080]  by producing an electromagnetic field like a shadow the shape of the electromagnetic field
[1:02:58.080 --> 1:03:05.600]  reflects the hexagonal and pentagonal shapes of the dna base pairs this electromagnetic field
[1:03:05.600 --> 1:03:13.280]  produces holes in the cellular liquid hexagonal pentagonal voids are created in the nucleoplasm
[1:03:13.280 --> 1:03:20.160]  and to remedy this disturbance extra bases are created to fill the voids these bases then
[1:03:20.160 --> 1:03:27.120]  join together to produce corona virus like structures within the cell which the pcr test
[1:03:27.120 --> 1:03:37.520]  will read as a positive case of covet 19 the exosome the exosome was discovered in 1983
[1:03:38.240 --> 1:03:43.680]  exosomes are created naturally within the cell to clean and repair cellular damage
[1:03:43.680 --> 1:03:51.760]  both exosomes and covet 19 are the same size and shape they both have the same
[1:03:51.760 --> 1:03:59.840]  ace to receptor and they both contain RNA exosomes behave and appear the same as a virus
[1:04:00.480 --> 1:04:08.560]  some scientists even claim that the so-called virus is in fact the exosome since the discovery
[1:04:08.560 --> 1:04:16.880]  of the exosome over 200 microbiologists have been murdered committed suicide or died in a suspicious
[1:04:16.880 --> 1:04:23.840]  manner if you question this mystery you are undoubtedly labeled a conspiracy theorist
[1:04:25.120 --> 1:04:32.640]  and if you question the current unproven virus theory you are labeled a science denier the only
[1:04:32.640 --> 1:04:38.640]  socially acceptable solution that you are allowed to accept is an experimental vaccine
[1:04:38.640 --> 1:04:45.760]  that will alter your dna which ultimately raises the question who owns your body
[1:04:47.760 --> 1:04:56.560]  for info wars dot com this is greg rees info wars tomorrow's news today coming up ted newton
[1:04:56.560 --> 1:05:03.440]  another part of the great awakening is taking place is people that haven't even been religious
[1:05:03.440 --> 1:05:09.600]  or christian now see how evil is out in the open how hundreds of churches have been burned in europe
[1:05:09.600 --> 1:05:16.000]  and the us hundreds of christian icons have been burned destroyed jesus's have had their heads cut
[1:05:16.000 --> 1:05:20.480]  off all over the country all over the philippines all over europe virgin marries are getting torn
[1:05:20.480 --> 1:05:26.080]  down i mean crosses are being torn down it's absolutely out of control but people now understand
[1:05:26.080 --> 1:05:32.560]  that evil was always real it is spiritual and it was just waiting to make its move building
[1:05:32.560 --> 1:05:37.040]  beneath the surface and now it's emerged that's why when i ask listeners and viewers for your prayer

[1:06:15.520 --> 1:06:19.680]  for ted newton at this critical time with nine nine days out from the election on the sunday
[1:06:19.680 --> 1:06:24.720]  july 26 second hour live broadcast and i went to him just during the one minute break and i said
[1:06:24.720 --> 1:06:29.360]  what do you want to hit first he said everything in our lifetimes has been building towards what
[1:06:29.360 --> 1:06:35.120]  is happening now this is america fighting for its life ted newton joins us to talk about a story
[1:06:35.120 --> 1:06:41.200]  that i'm reading out of law enforcement today and i went and looked at the local news they are
[1:06:41.200 --> 1:06:46.160]  proudly announcing that the governor said in new york you're not allowed to have a pro police rally
[1:06:46.160 --> 1:06:51.360]  the state police help you're fired if cops come out you're fired you don't have speech
[1:06:51.360 --> 1:06:57.280]  but the communists everybody else do and you've seen de blasio on tv saying oh communists have
[1:06:57.280 --> 1:07:01.760]  rights but nobody else does because they're so special this is the death of america and the
[1:07:01.760 --> 1:07:07.280]  headline says it all today we lost america and it gets into the situation i don't think we lost
[1:07:07.280 --> 1:07:13.040]  america yet but if we keep living on our laurels it's over so the motor city madman ted newton
[1:07:13.040 --> 1:07:18.400]  joins us to cover the waterfront thanks for coming on on short notice my pleasure alex i'm here to
[1:07:18.400 --> 1:07:23.280]  celebrate the good but it's not it's not easy to find right now there's an awful lot of bad and ugly
[1:07:23.280 --> 1:07:29.920]  but i really get the unique and humbling experience to maximize the good with the best of the best
[1:07:29.920 --> 1:07:35.600]  hardworking american families every day of my life but i was just uh returning from new york
[1:07:35.600 --> 1:07:41.600]  where another great family spent a fortune to get me and the good senator a good congressman
[1:07:41.600 --> 1:07:47.760]  clay higgins to a pro law enforcement rally a pro law and order rally the biggest one it was
[1:07:47.760 --> 1:07:54.000]  purported to be the biggest pro law enforcement law and order rally in the history of america
[1:07:54.000 --> 1:07:59.200]  they were expecting over 10 000 people because uh uncle ted was going to bring my six-string
[1:07:59.200 --> 1:08:04.160]  weapon of mass construction and perform a fire breathing star spangled banner for the troops
[1:08:04.160 --> 1:08:10.320]  and boost their morale at a time where the marxist democrat antifa ms-13 black lives matter
[1:08:10.320 --> 1:08:19.040]  are monsters have destroyed the morale of the law enforcement sheepdog heroes across this country
[1:08:19.040 --> 1:08:24.720]  most heartbreakingly now as we witness the great heroes of the new york police department
[1:08:24.720 --> 1:08:30.480]  so we were ready to go like i said my buddy jenna's up there i had the guitar and amp we had the
[1:08:30.480 --> 1:08:36.320]  good congressman we had great great law enforcement heroes and their families gathering and i literally
[1:08:36.320 --> 1:08:45.760]  was threatened by mary by governor kuomo and his handpicked marxist health department nazis
[1:08:46.560 --> 1:08:53.120]  that if i set foot in new york to play the national anthem and thank the law enforcement
[1:08:53.120 --> 1:09:01.360]  heroes if i dare enter his communist new york area i would be put under house arrest and
[1:09:01.360 --> 1:09:09.360]  quarantine for 14 days thereby destroying the only chance to have a morale boost by the
[1:09:09.360 --> 1:09:18.480]  heroes of the nypd and boy are they pissed and i'm just speechless at this point that
[1:09:19.040 --> 1:09:25.360]  he literally says communist can march you can attack the police they beat up the police commissioner
[1:09:25.360 --> 1:09:31.360]  and the news called it peaceful i mean this is crazy and then now you'll be arrested you'll
[1:09:31.360 --> 1:09:36.320]  be placed on house arrest you'll be kidnapped if you try to come play the national anthem this is
[1:09:36.320 --> 1:09:43.040]  next level you know we've known each other a long time alex and we've seen just indescribable
[1:09:43.040 --> 1:09:50.080]  but bizarre levels of criminal corruption and abuse of power by every alphabet soup you know
[1:09:50.080 --> 1:09:56.320]  government bureaucracy i mean who the hell trusts the cdc do you know anybody that trusts
[1:09:56.320 --> 1:10:06.240]  the cdc how about that james comey j edgar hoover al capone fbi punks that that obeyed an order
[1:10:06.240 --> 1:10:14.080]  to have a commando brown shirt gestapo attack on roger stone's house really you gotta you
[1:10:14.080 --> 1:10:23.120]  gotta bring machine guns to arrest roger stone and here's the horror of it these soulless dickless
[1:10:23.120 --> 1:10:33.520]  sheep of the fbi obeyed the immoral order that's what's frightening now i know a bunch of guys
[1:10:33.520 --> 1:10:39.680]  in the fbi in fact i went up there to new york with some good heroes of the fbi and god are
[1:10:39.680 --> 1:10:46.160]  they pissed off so any alphabet soup bureaucracy in the united states government right now whether
[1:10:46.160 --> 1:10:50.640]  it's the ira it's just like america it's divided it's got the america hating globalist in it
[1:10:50.640 --> 1:10:54.400]  that ran the tip and coup against trump and then it's got the good guys but the bad guys are getting
[1:10:54.400 --> 1:10:59.280]  more and more control and we've got to route them because they're not americans the democrats
[1:10:59.280 --> 1:11:03.840]  openly now say they don't want the country to exist and so law enforcement everybody else has
[1:11:03.840 --> 1:11:08.160]  decided which side are you on are you crazy they want to bring the country down this is insane
[1:11:08.160 --> 1:11:15.360]  yeah you know there were uh six bureaucrats soulless punks traders get glaringly guilty
[1:11:15.360 --> 1:11:24.000]  of treason their names are kevin abrahams syla boyn kerry salagas debora mule ellen
[1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:34.240]  bernard and arnie drucker they signed a lie a hate stinking lie that dig this that dead new jen
[1:11:34.240 --> 1:11:39.920]  is a racist a homophobe and an anti-semite you know i was wondering alice maybe the
[1:11:39.920 --> 1:11:45.280]  shooter probably talked to some of my black gay or jewish friends before they made those
[1:11:45.280 --> 1:11:50.480]  nasty they know it's all lies they're the ones engaged in race baiting sure and here's the thing
[1:11:50.480 --> 1:11:59.760]  what worst thing can a human do to another human than to falsely accuse and and officially make a
[1:11:59.760 --> 1:12:07.920]  government document lying with that level of hate and they're doing it with impunity and again
[1:12:07.920 --> 1:12:12.800]  you know alex i gotta tell you my buddy flew me back home and i got out my bow and arrow and my
[1:12:12.800 --> 1:12:18.160]  fishing rod and i spent a wonderful couple days with my dogs on my my miraculous paradise here in
[1:12:18.160 --> 1:12:23.760]  texas so they they didn't hurt ted new jen at all i mean are you kidding me what can they possibly
[1:12:23.760 --> 1:12:30.480]  do to me and i'll tell you what nothing but you know what they hurt they hurt the spirit and the
[1:12:30.480 --> 1:12:36.160]  morale of the new york police department heroes and their families well that's the next thing is
[1:12:36.160 --> 1:12:42.000]  their open season the left wants to brutalize the police not to get rid of them but to take them over
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:46.240]  can you imagine the left when the antifa is now going to have the badges and the guns because
[1:12:46.240 --> 1:12:50.720]  that's the goal of this you know i gotta tell you the leader of the democrat party is made
[1:12:50.720 --> 1:12:55.120]  of perfectly clear i mean in between her felonies you know you don't need to read this you need to
[1:12:55.120 --> 1:13:00.240]  sign it then Nancy Pelosi committed a felony on tv ripping up your and my state of the union
[1:13:00.240 --> 1:13:05.600]  address right there on tv and she hasn't been tackled in handcuffed historic document yeah the
[1:13:05.600 --> 1:13:15.760]  point is she leading the democrat party went into a tirade trying to find value and goodness in ms 13
[1:13:15.760 --> 1:13:25.040]  she said all god's children alex at what planet are these democrats and the by the way there's no
[1:13:25.040 --> 1:13:32.800]  difference between democrats antifa ms 13 the jihadists and the black lives matter they're
[1:13:32.800 --> 1:13:38.080]  all they're dedicated to destroy the very well that's my next question for you know we only got
[1:13:38.080 --> 1:13:42.240]  you one more segment here and i appreciate the time on this sunday the democrats are now saying
[1:13:42.240 --> 1:13:47.280]  shiff is now saying policy all of them that trump's a dictator and that when if he challenges the
[1:13:47.280 --> 1:13:51.600]  election that they say they're going to challenge it regardless if there's a like a 2000 argument
[1:13:51.600 --> 1:13:55.760]  that the pentagon's going to remove trump and then anyone that stands with trump will quote

[1:16:08.160 --> 1:16:13.600]  the virtue singers will be the angels even though our lord and master bill gates helped find the whole
[1:16:13.600 --> 1:16:23.440]  covid-19 oh no don't seduce me that's right that's the code word for bill gates this operation he
[1:16:23.440 --> 1:16:31.120]  carries out with his good little buddy dr fouchy in the surgeon cult as you know for girls there's
[1:16:31.120 --> 1:16:35.920]  five different types of villains they secretly desire in the romance novels one of them is the
[1:16:35.920 --> 1:16:42.960]  vampire their werewolf the billionaire and and who else oh that's right there's the surgeon and
[1:16:42.960 --> 1:16:48.480]  then there's one other one and it's so much fun to be ruled over by these psychotic psychopaths
[1:16:48.480 --> 1:16:53.680]  it's so good to know that there are masters and are coming to rape us with their inoculations
[1:16:54.320 --> 1:17:04.960]  psychopaths are so hot oh yeah it's the end of the world as we know it it's the end of the world as
[1:17:04.960 --> 1:17:16.640]  we know it it's the end of the world as we know it it's the end of the world as we know it and i
[1:17:16.640 --> 1:17:24.080]  don't feel fun this entire takeover has been battle planned blueprinted war-gamed field
[1:17:24.080 --> 1:17:30.240]  marshaled by the psychological war chiefs at the united nations and the fortune 100 this is the
[1:17:30.240 --> 1:17:37.920]  post-human takeover the new skits tighter when you comply not looser the entire covet 19 operation
[1:17:37.920 --> 1:17:42.720]  as a hoax now they admit the quote death numbers are dropping because those are fake where they
[1:17:42.720 --> 1:17:47.040]  count people that died of something else but it's all about how many cases there are and now they're
[1:17:47.040 --> 1:17:53.600]  saying most of the population will get it and then no one can go outside ever again it's totally
[1:17:53.600 --> 1:18:05.840]  insane it's a fraud it's all a lie vicki gibbs 57-year-old lesbian preacher in houston went in
[1:18:05.840 --> 1:18:13.600]  with a cough got intubated and then died and as soon as i saw her face as soon as i saw the report
[1:18:13.600 --> 1:18:19.360]  i said watch it'll be innovation we know what's gonna happen it's a blue city the same story yet
[1:18:19.360 --> 1:18:26.000]  again and they say her heart gave out if you put somebody on a breathing tube of covet 19 as a death
[1:18:26.000 --> 1:18:30.480]  sentence it's on record when everyone you know before they go to the hospital and get killed why
[1:18:30.480 --> 1:18:35.360]  are almost all the deaths happening in blue cities in blue states it's because they intubate them
[1:18:36.000 --> 1:18:41.520]  putting a tube in their lungs and covet 19 is causing an autoimmune response and if you do that
[1:18:41.520 --> 1:18:47.520]  with oxygen the doctors are on records saying it will kill you but all these doctors in blue
[1:18:47.520 --> 1:18:53.360]  cities in blue states follow their orders and the minute i saw this report today i knew what i would

[1:20:42.000 --> 1:20:45.680]  now the nfl is talking about getting rid of it entirely in the american flags bad
[1:20:45.680 --> 1:20:50.400]  ted newton this is an attempt to overthrow the country and you told me before it went on air that
[1:20:50.400 --> 1:20:54.880]  this this is the moment of history this is the attempt to take down the country can you elaborate
[1:20:54.880 --> 1:20:59.440]  on that and then you were talking off air to me about how angry you are about the footage of them
[1:20:59.440 --> 1:21:05.120]  burning the outside with all the fire and all the smoke and all the things flying around and
[1:21:05.120 --> 1:21:10.720]  coordinated with shields attacking the federal officers and trying to break in with hatchets
[1:21:10.720 --> 1:21:15.840]  and then hitting them in the face with hatchets and clubs and this is all called peaceful and
[1:21:15.840 --> 1:21:20.080]  the mainstream media covers it up and as you were saying you were watching cbs this morning
[1:21:20.080 --> 1:21:24.400]  and you saw the editing for yourself a footage you've seen online that shows them attacking
[1:21:24.400 --> 1:21:29.680]  this is premeditated evil from the establishment trying to break down law and order ted newton
[1:21:30.240 --> 1:21:36.800]  well alice i think i have a a reasonable and an accurate overview of what we have here in
[1:21:36.800 --> 1:21:42.720]  the united states of america in 2020 i was born in detroit 1948 when it was universally known
[1:21:42.720 --> 1:21:47.760]  as the arsenal of democracy a lot of people don't know that because they went to school in america
[1:21:47.760 --> 1:21:53.840]  but detroit was the arsenal of democracy and the way the newton family conducts our life we
[1:21:53.840 --> 1:22:00.080]  continue in our homes to be the arsenal of democracy but i was there in 67 when all my
[1:22:00.080 --> 1:22:05.120]  buddies all my black musician friends we always jam together and collaborate we always hung out
[1:22:05.120 --> 1:22:11.200]  together and i had friends of every imaginable ethnicity and color and greed and walk of life
[1:22:11.200 --> 1:22:18.640]  and then in 67 they burnt down the city the the writers went berserk and burnt down their own
[1:22:18.640 --> 1:22:24.320]  city this beautiful architecture so i have a good perspective of the the goodwill and the positive
[1:22:24.320 --> 1:22:29.760]  brotherhood that existed amongst all of us in detroit and then a a lunatic fringe segment
[1:22:29.760 --> 1:22:36.000]  went nuts much like precursors to ads of event i was in los angeles in 92 when the rodney king
[1:22:36.000 --> 1:22:43.040]  burda came in and once again the idiots committed cultural suicide and destroyed their own neighborhoods
[1:22:43.040 --> 1:22:49.520]  and lives and viciously attacked and murdered people so what i'm seeing today it breaks my heart
[1:22:49.520 --> 1:22:57.600]  to admit but it's it's bigger and worse and uglier and more evil and it's best presented by the by
[1:22:57.600 --> 1:23:06.400]  the propaganda ministry of the network uh news state network television stations and all pretty
[1:23:06.400 --> 1:23:10.960]  much all of them except fox and fox is no angel i believe me but compared to the rest of them
[1:23:10.960 --> 1:23:16.160]  they almost appear to be but i watched cbs this morning where they showed you know with this harsh
[1:23:16.160 --> 1:23:21.360]  accusation against the troops going after writers you know people only they called them
[1:23:21.360 --> 1:23:27.520]  peaceful protesters peaceful protesters don't destroy buildings they don't have maltoff cocktails
[1:23:27.520 --> 1:23:33.520]  they don't kill retired cops and they don't wear helmets and have weapons on them that's not a
[1:23:33.520 --> 1:23:40.160]  peaceful protest but the way the propaganda ministry twists it if you're dumb enough and if
[1:23:40.160 --> 1:23:47.440]  you're stoned or drunk enough or just mentally deranged enough i suppose you can buy into that
[1:23:47.440 --> 1:23:53.200]  anti-farm might actually be anti-fascist when they actually are the fascist and black lives matter
[1:23:53.200 --> 1:24:00.480]  has absolutely nothing to do with black lives and by the way while you're talking we're showing
[1:24:00.480 --> 1:24:04.880]  footage from just two days ago of them burning the outside of the courthouse there's even more
[1:24:04.880 --> 1:24:11.200]  dramatic footage i mean this is crazy and i have video after video of them randomly running out on
[1:24:11.200 --> 1:24:16.560]  highways and shooting at random vehicles i have footage of them jumping on an old lady's car trying
[1:24:16.560 --> 1:24:22.240]  to pull her out of the car in austin last night and the media says this is good a bunch of thugs
[1:24:22.240 --> 1:24:27.760]  attacking old ladies what the hell has happened to the left they have gone completely crazy were
[1:24:27.760 --> 1:24:33.120]  they always this nuts they've always been this nuts but it's reached a new peak because of the
[1:24:33.120 --> 1:24:39.520]  tolerance to their uh... their escalating danger their escalating insanity their escalating corruption
[1:24:39.520 --> 1:24:44.560]  their escalating criminality and again when you got the speaker of the house committing felonies
[1:24:44.560 --> 1:24:52.400]  on tv and trying to find worth and loving value in ms-13 that's a green light and an open door
[1:24:52.400 --> 1:24:58.640]  to go ahead and be as nasty and rotten and dangerous and evil as you want to be because the
[1:24:58.640 --> 1:25:06.320]  democrats we got your back antifa were with you and if that dog gone president trump tries to stop
[1:25:06.320 --> 1:25:11.120]  you from burning down the city we're going to try to stop him because we like it when you burn
[1:25:11.120 --> 1:25:17.040]  down the city so and again what they said about me being a racist and a homophobe and a and an
[1:25:17.040 --> 1:25:23.760]  anti-semite alex i've been surrounded by blacks and jews my entire life they own every record
[1:25:23.760 --> 1:25:28.640]  company they're my producers they're my friends they're my musicians they're my promoters they're
[1:25:28.640 --> 1:25:36.160]  my bandmates it's it's unbelievable the left the depth of dishonesty and hate and once again
[1:25:36.160 --> 1:25:42.800]  i'm going to read their names up in new york they are just evil kevin abraham's and syla boine
[1:25:42.800 --> 1:25:50.240]  terry soler just debora mule ellen bernum and arnie drucker lied and falsely accused me of those
[1:25:50.240 --> 1:26:01.040]  nasty conditions while they continue with their support for arson murder assault rape and total
[1:26:01.040 --> 1:26:07.200]  terrorism so this really is the planet of the cuckoo's nest and i couldn't be more proud to have
[1:26:07.200 --> 1:26:14.000]  that level of evil people hate me it proves i might even be better than i think i am well last
[1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:19.600]  time you were on your wife she she's absolutely right especially in these times we've got to stay
[1:26:19.600 --> 1:26:25.600]  focused and and just appreciate god and family and not get too upset i get too upset uh and i know
[1:26:25.600 --> 1:26:29.920]  it upsets you but at at a certain point those of us that have been upset have been holding back the
[1:26:29.920 --> 1:26:33.920]  total takeover i think a lot of people that have been on the fence now know that this new world
[1:26:33.920 --> 1:26:38.800]  order takeover this communist takeovers real but they're wondering what can they do well go vote
[1:26:38.800 --> 1:26:44.800]  register others to vote speak out stand up run for office locally go to your city council speak
[1:26:44.800 --> 1:26:50.640]  out against anti-fund BLM all of us have to have our voices heard calling to talk radio calling to
[1:26:50.640 --> 1:26:56.000]  c-span call your members of congress and tell them that you support law and order it's really just
[1:26:56.000 --> 1:27:01.600]  all of us the silent majority have to stop being silent is that accurate ted newton that's 100% the
[1:27:01.600 --> 1:27:06.640]  dream of the founding fathers that this is an experiment self-government where every american
[1:27:06.640 --> 1:27:14.080]  has a moral and spiritual obligation to be engaged in the process of determining who will represent
[1:27:14.080 --> 1:27:22.080]  we the people constitutionally the pillars of god family country individual freedoms from god
[1:27:22.080 --> 1:27:28.160]  if you don't hammer that home to your elected employees and if you don't vote for god family
[1:27:28.160 --> 1:27:34.640]  and country then the antifa thinks you're one of them that's how nasty it is i have a monday and
[1:27:34.640 --> 1:27:40.080]  thursday night ted newton spirit campfire every week is a broadcast on my facebook and all over
[1:27:40.080 --> 1:27:47.920]  social media but my god after this debacle by kuomo and all the liberal uh by uh democrat
[1:27:47.920 --> 1:27:54.880]  antifa ms-13 black lives matter terrorists in new york the real heartbreak are those heroes of
[1:27:54.880 --> 1:28:02.000]  law enforcement and the nypd and their families who feel spat upon who feel bludgeoned by the
[1:28:02.000 --> 1:28:07.200]  by the people in charge because they're the kuomos and the deblosios in the health department
[1:28:07.200 --> 1:28:12.320]  and even even the upper echelon the police commissioner and some of the police benevolent
[1:28:12.320 --> 1:28:19.840]  association turncoats they've turned on the men and women of the nypd and it's alex it's in almost
[1:28:19.840 --> 1:28:24.960]  every jurisdiction across that's right they've sided with the globalist takeover because they
[1:28:24.960 --> 1:28:29.920]  think america's done and they've sided with the wrong side and good police officers have to stay
[1:28:29.920 --> 1:28:34.480]  in there because they want to run you out they want to have a takeover ted newton dot com
[1:28:34.480 --> 1:28:38.880]  is also a place to find everything ted newton ted join us soon in the next few weeks as all
[1:28:38.880 --> 1:28:42.880]  this develops because there's so much to talk about i'm sure you go on for their hour thank you so
[1:28:42.880 --> 1:28:48.240]  much to say hi to your family for me thanks hunt the vote dot org everybody god bless real america
[1:28:48.240 --> 1:28:53.840]  god bless you there goes ted newton band from new york by kuomo but commies and antifa they
[1:28:53.840 --> 1:29:00.720]  could do whatever the hell they want a lot of you have been listening for more than 20 years
[1:29:00.720 --> 1:29:06.480]  and if you go back to those shows we laid out the ai takeover plan the tracking of cell phones
[1:29:07.120 --> 1:29:13.120]  how programmed master computers would manipulate control society how they'd be able to not just
[1:29:13.120 --> 1:29:18.320]  predict large groups of human movements and activities but even predict what individuals
[1:29:18.320 --> 1:29:22.640]  would do and then once you could predict what individuals were going to be doing you can add
[1:29:22.640 --> 1:29:28.560]  stimuli through the ai systems through the computers through digital billboards through
[1:29:28.560 --> 1:29:33.440]  face scanning through the social credit score to control people and make them act like you wanted
[1:29:33.440 --> 1:29:38.960]  to but when we cover that the media would attack us and say we were making it up it was a conspiracy
[1:29:38.960 --> 1:29:44.320]  theory even though it was in the actual corporate level blueprint documents well the next level of
[1:29:44.320 --> 1:29:49.280]  the blueprint documents explained to us that they are setting up this control system to make humans
[1:29:49.280 --> 1:29:54.960]  obsolete and phase us out and it's something about a thousand times crazier than what hitler planned
[1:29:54.960 --> 1:30:03.280]  so we might want to dismantle the system now we are selling more privacy pockets a day that we
[1:30:03.280 --> 1:30:08.960]  were previously selling in a month because of the clinton foundation running the contact tracing
[1:30:08.960 --> 1:30:13.200]  and admittedly with google and apple tracking all americans on their phones even if you hopped out of
[1:30:13.200 --> 1:30:18.480]  it or get rid of the apps people realize these criminal groups are surveilling you and selling
[1:30:18.480 --> 1:30:24.480]  your data and using it to control your life sharing it with antifa sharing it with black lives matter
[1:30:24.480 --> 1:30:29.200]  sharing it with the deep state to oppress not just high-profile people but the general public
[1:30:29.200 --> 1:30:34.240]  that's why folks are taking back control their lives with these little faraday cages that you
[1:30:34.240 --> 1:30:38.960]  can put your cell phones in that knock out the ability of the cell towers to ping at every
[1:30:38.960 --> 1:30:44.240]  few seconds and track your location this is the only way to have your privacy and people are

[1:32:56.800 --> 1:33:04.400]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:33:16.400 --> 1:33:21.360]  the alex jones show because there is a war on for your mind
[1:33:21.360 --> 1:33:30.640]  can you believe how we've been trained to not leave our houses when we're told we're
[1:33:30.640 --> 1:33:37.920]  masking them it's all a fraud and then i was watching a joe rogan clip yesterday
[1:33:37.920 --> 1:33:41.440]  because it was all over the news joe rogan's moving to texas you know i told you that a
[1:33:41.440 --> 1:33:45.840]  couple months ago remember and of course joe won't say where he's moving in texas
[1:33:45.840 --> 1:33:54.080]  he's like that's lengthening out the announcement that he's already moved to texas but oh wait i'm
[1:33:54.080 --> 1:34:04.400]  just joking and i wonder where he moved in texas but um i don't know spotify went completely crazy
[1:34:04.400 --> 1:34:11.840]  when joe told me i could say all that stuff then i kind of elaborated on it and kind of added
[1:34:11.840 --> 1:34:16.560]  some hyperbole probably because you know i took what joe said as well he's saying up to youtube
[1:34:16.560 --> 1:34:24.080]  saying up sensors you know the stuff he told me but uh i'm not going to pontificate on that right
[1:34:24.080 --> 1:34:30.800]  now because it's part of a larger story that i want to hit at the start of the next segment but
[1:34:30.800 --> 1:34:36.320]  i will play the clip of joe talking about moving to texas because then he and his guests talk about
[1:34:36.320 --> 1:34:42.240]  you know is covid really bad and the new york times guy's like oh texas is now wearing masks because
[1:34:42.240 --> 1:34:46.880]  they figured out they were wrong it's really bad uh no they're past laws with two thousand dollar
[1:34:46.880 --> 1:34:53.040]  fines in places like austin if you know people are also online going why does joe sell a covid mask
[1:34:53.040 --> 1:35:01.680]  with info or is on it if he doesn't think it's real well a i do believe it's real we pioneered
[1:35:01.680 --> 1:35:07.200]  exposing it was man-made it's meant to infect everyone so you can all be suspect and so bill
[1:35:07.200 --> 1:35:13.280]  gates can patent a vaccine to bring you and that's all being confirmed now and if you've got to wear
[1:35:13.280 --> 1:35:20.400]  the mask have an info wars dot com on it so you can educate people and use their own suppression
[1:35:20.400 --> 1:35:26.640]  they're using against you on them but the reason i'm kicking this to the last segment is i forgot
[1:35:26.640 --> 1:35:34.960]  to tell the great crew that's been put up with me tonight to find some clips of sharia police in
[1:35:36.640 --> 1:35:45.200]  salya arabia or in iran shia and anzuni there's footage everywhere of of burka police or hijab
[1:35:45.200 --> 1:35:50.560]  police arresting women that aren't wearing face coverings and then we've got footage of people
[1:35:50.560 --> 1:35:56.560]  being arrested or ticketed for not wearing masks or not wearing it correctly there's always more
[1:35:56.560 --> 1:36:05.760]  more more they want to get your submission so literally foushee is the hijab burka police
[1:36:05.760 --> 1:36:09.600]  so we'll get some of those clips together and then i'll respond to what joe rogan's guest
[1:36:10.160 --> 1:36:16.400]  had to say coming up next segment joe is bucking the mask he knows it's a bunch of bull
[1:36:17.280 --> 1:36:18.880]  he knows the virus is way overblown
[1:36:21.440 --> 1:36:23.840]  had a long talk with him a few weeks ago but i'm gonna leave it at that
[1:36:23.840 --> 1:36:30.240]  but joe is very influential and and and so i'd like to educate his listeners and when we do
[1:36:30.240 --> 1:36:34.560]  respond to joe things want to show that goes viral and so i can kind of piggyback on there
[1:36:34.560 --> 1:36:38.640]  and educate some people before it's too late so that's coming up next segment but let me
[1:36:38.640 --> 1:36:44.560]  hit this right now since i said i would do it and maybe we'll take this little clip and
[1:36:45.200 --> 1:36:49.520]  put at the end of the segment when we put out the last segment of the last hour where i was
[1:36:49.520 --> 1:36:56.960]  talking about this alexander schultz and eason uh was sent for many many years to a frozen slave
[1:36:56.960 --> 1:37:03.360]  camp what he called the gulag archipelago and the little islands all across the frozen tundra
[1:37:04.080 --> 1:37:13.360]  landscape and he came out and wrote a best-selling book titled gulag archipelago
[1:37:13.360 --> 1:37:24.320]  and here is a quote from the gulag archipelago 1918 to 1956
[1:37:25.440 --> 1:37:32.240]  and how we burned in the camps later thinking what would things have been like if every security
[1:37:32.240 --> 1:37:37.840]  operative when he went out at night to make an arrest had been uncertain whether he would return
[1:37:37.840 --> 1:37:44.720]  alive and had to say goodbye to his family or if during periods of the mass arrest as for example
[1:37:44.720 --> 1:37:50.880]  in leningrad when they arrested a quarter of the entire city people had not simply sat there in
[1:37:50.880 --> 1:37:57.120]  their layers pawling with care at every bang on the downstairs door at every step on the staircase
[1:37:57.120 --> 1:38:03.920]  but had understood they had nothing left to lose and had boldly set up in the downstairs hall
[1:38:03.920 --> 1:38:11.440]  an ambush of half a dozen people with axes hammers pokers or whatever else they had the organs
[1:38:12.480 --> 1:38:18.400]  would very quickly have suffered a shortage of officers and transport and notwithstanding
[1:38:18.400 --> 1:38:27.280]  all of stolence first the curse machine would have ground to a halt if if we didn't love freedom
[1:38:27.280 --> 1:38:34.720]  enough and even more we had no awareness of the real situation we purely and simply deserve everything
[1:38:34.720 --> 1:38:43.360]  that happened afterward now that's when the commies came in and took over the government
[1:38:43.360 --> 1:38:47.360]  with rioters and burning and then they got the government the police and military capitulate
[1:38:47.360 --> 1:38:52.800]  okay you're the boss and then they took over moscow it took them two years to take over
[1:38:52.800 --> 1:38:56.000]  really five years the rest of the country and then they just started raping and killing and
[1:38:56.000 --> 1:39:00.640]  murdering and they're modeling all of it off of this and what mal did in china
[1:39:03.120 --> 1:39:08.720]  and kim jung un and you know his father and grandfather they set up the same system and
[1:39:09.600 --> 1:39:14.560]  gg ping denounced his own father his sister was beaten to death in front of him by a youth brigade
[1:39:14.560 --> 1:39:21.040]  he praised it and so now he runs the country because he literally sacrificed his family who
[1:39:21.040 --> 1:39:30.560]  were good people for nothing to worship communism because his father had been a communist and helped
[1:39:30.560 --> 1:39:34.160]  get them in power he was like the number three in the government but he said let's not murder all
[1:39:34.160 --> 1:39:39.600]  the farmers let's not kill the family and and moscow tongue said i'm taking orders from the
[1:39:39.600 --> 1:39:44.640]  rockefellers we're we're gonna kill a large portion of our people that's the deal
[1:39:44.640 --> 1:39:50.880]  and so you know the rest of the story you know gg ping sits on top of it because he's one evil monster
[1:39:52.320 --> 1:39:58.400]  he took part multiple times in pilloring his father after he sent a decade into forced labor camp
[1:39:58.400 --> 1:40:03.520]  that they would do public communications when his father came back and gg ping would scream and yell
[1:40:03.520 --> 1:40:07.360]  and throw things at his father in front of everyone in the little youth and then a little
[1:40:07.360 --> 1:40:11.840]  12-year-old girls would run up and spit on him and throw rocks on him and gg ping would sit there
[1:40:11.840 --> 1:40:21.440]  and denounce his father that's the type of trash that's gg ping he lives on his knees the satan
[1:40:22.240 --> 1:40:27.040]  and so he's rewarded with being able to kill his own people in mass and spin up that virus with
[1:40:27.040 --> 1:40:33.600]  Fauci and all the rest of it so when we come back i'm going to respond to what's really going on
[1:40:33.600 --> 1:40:43.200]  with the mask and the hijab and the hijab because that's all any of this is is a burqa
[1:40:44.880 --> 1:40:50.320]  and this is a submission what does islam mean submission separately ladies and gentlemen
[1:40:50.320 --> 1:40:54.800]  we've got a solution to tyranny it's only one part of the overall solution and it funds the info
[1:40:54.800 --> 1:41:01.600]  award these privacy pockets i have are almost 100 effective we've tested them out they're one of

[1:42:01.120 --> 1:42:05.520]  i want you to get these and get in the habit to think about how evil these cell phones are

[1:45:57.760 --> 1:46:12.720]  been on air in 26 years starting about 24 years ago i began to get calls from major hollywood directors producers actors they wanted to meet with me and they said what is your formal education and i said well really nothing but a few years of college they said well
[1:46:12.720 --> 1:46:32.560]  how are you one of the best science fiction or cultural writers we've ever heard the stuff you come up with is just unbelievable we'd like to be in movies we'd like you to write with us we'd like you to do voiceovers you're just a renaissance man and folks know i was in some movies and harry sure made statements like that a lot of others i'm not bragging
[1:46:32.560 --> 1:46:56.560]  i kept explaining to him i said do you understand i didn't come up with any of this i'm reading globalist mit white papers and futurist documents and they would just laugh me and say oh no way then i would give them the documents they would get very very scared you know the next time i saw them in a few months and say man you're right this is dystopic folks i didn't make any of this up okay it's real it's real
[1:46:56.560 --> 1:47:02.560]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:47:26.560 --> 1:47:36.560]  welcome back i'm your host alex jones coming to you from deep in the heart of texas austin here's the zero hedge headline the exodus begins
[1:47:36.560 --> 1:47:50.560]  well it actually began a long time ago joe rogan is leaving la for texas maybe he's already here because he wants a little bit more freedom he had a new york times writer on and they discussed it then they got into wearing mask
[1:47:50.560 --> 1:48:10.560]  it all ties together i'm going to get into that right now but think about this in iran in saudi arabia in sudan in more than 20 countries women have to fully cover their faces and where burq is full be keeper suits and the other countries they have to partially cover themselves up
[1:48:10.560 --> 1:48:22.560]  because you know a woman showing herself is very evil of another man sees it now they have a movement in iran where women take them off and they get arrested they even get shot they even get killed
[1:48:22.560 --> 1:48:34.560]  but see that's because a woman's dirty she's bad she deserves it i guess under sharia law the left thinks that's really fashionable and cool and all these big leftist stores you show the jibs and the burqinis for women cover up their whole bodies to go swimming
[1:48:34.560 --> 1:48:54.560]  but now because we're all dirty and can have the evil covid we all have to cover ourselves because falchi who's been wrong about everything and totally lied to us he says so and because the head of the un says it's only getting worse it's never getting better
[1:48:54.560 --> 1:49:09.560]  so that's where all this is going and police are brutalizing people in new york and places like miami florida all leftist areas if they don't wear their new little sign of submission islam means submission
[1:49:09.560 --> 1:49:24.560]  well i'm not submitting to islam or to the NIH or any of this but you know the WHO head is a communist islamist on top of it and they know this is a sign of total control and slavery so boy
[1:49:24.560 --> 1:49:45.560]  every thought had come here now they're saying the master basically permanent i played that clip in a special saturday show but you can pull it up WHO head says lockdown will never end prop said falchi'd have us shut down for years he said 2.5 million would be dead it's 150,000 most of them died of other diseases i heard a five year old died
[1:49:45.560 --> 1:49:57.560]  my wife was sitting there i said let me guess it says he had underlying conditions yeah it says multiple underlying conditions then you test false positive most of them are false positive
[1:49:57.560 --> 1:50:09.560]  it's incredible so we have to challenge this but here is the mask not see it's up on info wars dot com woman maces couple with their children not wearing masks while eating at a park
[1:50:09.560 --> 1:50:22.560]  that's i've been in restaurants in austin our women coming to jib and they're eating spaghetti under it like this what a clown show but now there's a crazy woman at a park in san diego a good liberal where they submit
[1:50:22.560 --> 1:50:26.560]  this is what she did to the family daring to go outside here it is
[1:50:26.560 --> 1:50:48.560]  what are you doing you cannot be serious you just you just maced him you just maced him you just maced him and their food because you just agreed don't worry i'm videotaping

[1:51:11.560 --> 1:51:22.560]  did she hurt her i didn't do anything but see they say you're bad you're all suspect and so they're gonna come literally spray your food like the wicked witch she's hiked her leg on you
[1:51:22.560 --> 1:51:35.560]  now let's shift gears joe rogan had joe desina of the new york times on and he's talking about i'm coming to texas i heard davie crock is coming to texas sometime too
[1:51:35.560 --> 1:51:51.560]  i already got there sorry and then they get into oh texas are wearing their mask now well yeah in austin because it's basically la and there's two thousand dollar fines of a business doesn't have people do it five hundred percent is totally unconstitutional
[1:51:51.560 --> 1:52:04.560]  it's got medical waivers in there but nobody tells you that if you say you have anxiety or whatever it's totally ineffective all the studies show it but notice the new york times guy goes oh texas got reality texas figured it out
[1:52:04.560 --> 1:52:17.560]  and they're wearing their mask now because it's so serious you mean they're doing 100 times the testing and the tester fraudulent on record i played a report earlier where the cdc admits it's not covered it's any type of viral or bacterial infection
[1:52:17.560 --> 1:52:30.560]  they're not saying picks it up the test is a fraud but we just barrel forward with it they're counting people that died of other things in it it's 20 something times less than what they said would die and but notice it's never ending though
[1:52:30.560 --> 1:52:47.560]  it's not the 15 days the hospitals weren't filled it's forever because once you let a group take over like this they never turn loose we have a medical global tyranny this is the u n running this telling us we must follow what the u n says oh that's not w h o approved
[1:52:47.560 --> 1:53:02.560]  a communist the guy the heads of the w h o is admitted communist bill gates is financing it all on record i'll show you something after this joe rogan clippen here let's go ahead and roll the clip with joe talking about he's coming to texas here it is
[1:53:02.560 --> 1:53:04.560]  and what's the story moving
[1:53:04.560 --> 1:53:06.560]  i'm out of here when do you leave
[1:53:06.560 --> 1:53:07.560]  soon
[1:53:07.560 --> 1:53:08.560]  texas are
[1:53:08.560 --> 1:53:09.560]  yeah i'm gonna go to texas
[1:53:09.560 --> 1:53:11.560]  i got a farm in vermont
[1:53:11.560 --> 1:53:22.560]  it's a little cold i i i just want to go somewhere in the center of the country somewhere it's easier to travel to both places and somewhere where you have a little bit more freedom also i think that
[1:53:22.560 --> 1:53:31.560]  where we live right here in los angeles is overcrowded and i think most of the time that's not a problem but i think it's exposing the fact that it's a real issue
[1:53:31.560 --> 1:53:47.560]  when you look at the number of people that are catching covid because of this overpopulation issue when you look at the traffic when you look at the economic despair when you look at the homelessness problem that's accelerated radically over the last
[1:53:47.560 --> 1:53:58.560]  six seven ten years i think there's too many people here i think it's not tenable i don't think it's manageable and i think every mayor does a shit job of doing it because i don't think anybody could do a great job of it
[1:53:58.560 --> 1:54:08.560]  i think there's like certain things you're gonna have to deal with when you have a population of whatever the fuck la is like twenty million plus people too many people it's too many people
[1:54:08.560 --> 1:54:18.560]  yeah that's what i think i think where you're living is probably the perfect way to do it five hundred people that's nuts but then you got those dudes yelling at you where's the deer you understand the language
[1:54:18.560 --> 1:54:38.560]  i could go on we could do it hours of the negatives of small town everybody knows your business yeah everybody knows what you're doing where you're going you know this pros and cons to everything but i think i think you have a better opportunity at more pros when there's less folks
[1:54:38.560 --> 1:55:00.560]  i agree so small town texas or let's just leave it at that yeah i got ideas james we got him he's all excited it doesn't affect the business now we're just gonna do it from there that's the other thing is texas has comedy they have stand-up comedy i've been doing i did well i haven't been doing but i did one weekend in texas while this was going on it was the first weekend i was able to stand up
[1:55:00.560 --> 1:55:14.560]  but then my friends were in san Antonio and they got covered down there but those knuckleheads were out there talking to people and shaking hands and taking pictures and stuff and texas would be the last stand place to ever wear a mask or not shake a hand
[1:55:14.560 --> 1:55:38.560]  they wear masks though people are wearing masks last time i was there i think now they're woken up right well this is a weird disease man all right and you know i've talked to joe about this and he said no you're the first person telling it was man-made so doesn't that make it deadly no it's man-made so it's a chimera so it's artificial so these labs can own it and control it and on the testing for it and it's all fraud and we've detailed this here's an example
[1:55:38.560 --> 1:55:49.560]  right here sin claire bigger than fox news thousands stations across the country says it will postpone and rework segment featuring conspiracy theory about fouchy with the eric bowling show
[1:55:49.560 --> 1:55:57.560]  i personally sent bowling articles about this last few months he knew all about it already and what did he cover NIH dot gov
[1:55:57.560 --> 1:56:12.560]  NIH lifts funding pause on gain of function research with coronaviruses dr fouchy back controversial will on lab with us dollars for risky coronavirus research at will on lab newsweek newsweek look right there that's newsweek
[1:56:12.560 --> 1:56:31.560]  new scientists lab main coronavirus triggers debate obama and fouchy transfer weaponized coronavirus chimera from batch to china to 2015 this is the reality to joe's guest the new york times that the cases are skyrocketing the deaths are going way down
[1:56:31.560 --> 1:56:45.560]  i predict they'll go spiking again up when the numbers coming at the end of the month because july is when the new doctors and nurses come in for their residencies and they call it the july effect i look at i get into real statistics real information
[1:56:45.560 --> 1:56:57.560]  real research it was a major scientific scandal that our government said we've got to make it illegal the scientists told obama you can't have these weaponized coronaviruses our labs so he just took it to china
[1:56:57.560 --> 1:57:08.560]  and fouchy ran it with bill gates look up who funded wuhan and now sinclair is under criticism for this they go oh we'll rework it or won't air it
[1:57:08.560 --> 1:57:22.560]  and i just showed you newsweek NIH new scientists i can show you 100 more was a major major controversy but since when is oliver darcy the guy that brags he helped get me banned off the internet since when is that rat
[1:57:22.560 --> 1:57:32.560]  that possum the guy that goes around the sides what can be on air what can't info wars dot com news wars dot com is full show be posted to band off video please promote all our local stations
[1:57:32.560 --> 1:57:47.560]  thank the local sponsors become a sponsor but realize the globals are fighting to keep us from getting out but thanks to you the broadcast is actually exploding god bless you all retransmission starts now spread those live links
[1:57:47.560 --> 1:57:55.560]  there are a lot of reasons to get an alex jones plastic mask at infowarstore.com you can wear them out to political events you can trigger it live darts
[1:57:55.560 --> 1:58:09.560]  but one of the biggest reasons is it's a great conversation starter at any costume party or at halloween but on top of that they admit that wearing these masks is absolutely nothing to protect you from covid-19 or anything else
[1:58:09.560 --> 1:58:20.560]  it's total virtues signaling to show that you're prepared for the force inoculations of contact tracing of their openly announcing it's an active submission it's an act of like putting a burqa on your head and bowing down
[1:58:20.560 --> 1:58:30.560]  but a big reason to wear these is then in the stores when people ask you why you're wearing a halloween mask say it's just as useless as the stupid cloth mask that you're wearing
[1:58:30.560 --> 1:58:41.560]  and the m95 mask only control what's coming in not what's going out so they quote spread covid-19 they don't protect from it so again it's a great way to throw it back in these control freaks faces
[1:58:41.560 --> 1:58:47.560]  you buy one for 995 you get four more free they're at cost infowarstore.com
[1:58:47.560 --> 1:58:55.560]  there are a lot of signs that people are really waiting up to the new world order in global government but one of the biggest is privacy pouches
[1:58:55.560 --> 1:59:02.560]  I've been selling these for more than 10 years in the old days they weren't 100% effective now they are they're a little bitty
[1:59:02.560 --> 1:59:09.560]  lightweight Faraday cages that small phones and even large cell phones fit into very very comfortably and then slip right into your pocket
[1:59:09.560 --> 1:59:13.560]  and these things work great that way you're not tracked you're not traced by government
[1:59:13.560 --> 1:59:19.560]  by big corporations by big tech by hackers by criminals they're selling your data they're using it against you
[1:59:19.560 --> 1:59:27.560]  AI uses this to be able to predict the future of manipulate markets it's critical that everyone stop going around with your cell phones being naked
[1:59:27.560 --> 1:59:33.560]  well I gotta tell you normally we probably sold a couple hundred a month we're selling upwards of a thousand of these a day
