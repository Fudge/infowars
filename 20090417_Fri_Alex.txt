[00:00.000 --> 00:11.400]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.400 --> 00:18.960]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:18.960 --> 00:42.200]  Texas Alex Jones we have several informative guests joining us later in
[00:42.200 --> 00:48.180]  the transmission today we've got to Oklahoma State Senator Randy Brogdon
[00:48.180 --> 00:55.160]  popping in for just 5-10 minutes to give us an update the Senate has passed the
[00:55.160 --> 00:59.940]  bill there for 10th Amendment states rights we'll find out where that's
[00:59.940 --> 01:04.240]  going in the house or it has to go into conference of course you have the
[01:04.240 --> 01:09.080]  governor of Texas Rick Perry saying Texas may secede they've got a poll out
[01:09.080 --> 01:14.040]  asking Texans if they want us to cede that is just a political stunt by
[01:14.040 --> 01:21.640]  someone whose political career is dead if he doesn't pose as a populist and we
[01:21.640 --> 01:27.000]  have a syndicated radio talk show host Raleigh James joining us coming up in
[01:27.000 --> 01:32.640]  the fourth hour today very informative very intelligent a great talk show
[01:32.640 --> 01:38.400]  host I remember listening to her when I was in college here in Austin Texas on
[01:38.400 --> 01:48.360]  KLBJ AM 590 so she will be joining us coming up today as well okay here is
[01:48.360 --> 01:54.160]  the score I'm gonna open the phones up we don't screen your phone calls but I
[01:54.160 --> 02:00.400]  specifically want to hear from listeners on what's happening with the economy the
[02:00.400 --> 02:07.560]  announcement and the release of detailed memos on torture I specifically
[02:07.560 --> 02:13.720]  would like to get your take on the bills moving through the house and send it
[02:13.720 --> 02:18.880]  to basically ban organic farming and but heavy restrictions on family farms and
[02:18.880 --> 02:24.880]  ranches but waivers for big agriculture to shut them down Obama appointee wants
[02:24.880 --> 02:29.280]  Soviet style media they're openly announcing that they want to license all
[02:29.280 --> 02:33.600]  reporters and one way to shutting down freedom on the internet this makes the
[02:33.600 --> 02:39.080]  fairness doctrine pale and significance there's a host of serious issues I'm
[02:39.080 --> 02:42.360]  going to cover coming up in the next segment and I will open the phones up
[02:42.360 --> 02:47.440]  on the tea parties on the Mayak reports on the federal reports saying the
[02:47.440 --> 02:50.720]  veterans of the most dangerous threat gun owners of the most dangerous threat
[02:50.720 --> 02:58.640]  and our potential terrorist this is finally starting to wake people up 1-800-259-9231
[02:58.640 --> 03:07.400]  but if you watch what Obama is doing a few months ago he released some of the
[03:07.400 --> 03:12.520]  White House memos on torture the full memos were John you and Attorney General
[03:12.520 --> 03:17.400]  Gonzalez and others are saying the president is the law he can order
[03:17.400 --> 03:21.360]  children tortured in front of their parents and by the way the Washington
[03:21.360 --> 03:26.320]  Post reported in early 2002 that they were proud of it they were selling it to
[03:26.320 --> 03:30.080]  the public they said oh CIA section chief in the Middle East says they
[03:30.080 --> 03:36.160]  tortured people's children in front of their parents and then to sell the public
[03:36.160 --> 03:40.840]  on it so the public could kind of live through the torturers they would have
[03:40.840 --> 03:45.160]  all the different TV shows like 24 and things show children being tortured in
[03:45.160 --> 03:48.840]  front of their parents and so everybody could become psychopaths with them be
[03:48.840 --> 03:55.120]  part of the mass devilish ritual you know being sold with suspended disbelief
[03:55.120 --> 04:03.160]  as the hero tortures the child the most satanic thing you can do now being
[04:03.160 --> 04:08.840]  heroic that is mind control so folks would would would would simulate
[04:08.840 --> 04:16.720]  torturing children to save America while living through Jack Bauer and then in
[04:16.720 --> 04:20.880]  the real world they were in the Washington Post saying yes we torture
[04:20.880 --> 04:24.600]  children in front of their parents but you know this is how we keep America safe
[04:24.600 --> 04:29.640]  and then they kept calling it well it's harsh interrogation we're getting tough
[04:29.640 --> 04:33.400]  that's one of the headlines tough interrogations you know we're tough
[04:33.400 --> 04:40.000]  we're Americans we're tough and then they say Obama says well it wasn't really
[04:40.000 --> 04:47.240]  torture we just chain you up in a standing position for 180 hours ladies

[06:20.080 --> 06:24.560]  Obama's already fudging yeah fudged since day one in this election if you
[06:24.560 --> 06:28.920]  have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is
[06:28.920 --> 06:34.120]  imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs
[06:34.120 --> 06:40.640]  that's fascism it's not about left to right it's about a one-world government

[08:10.200 --> 08:18.440]  GCN radio network. If I just come on air
[08:19.520 --> 08:27.520]  and non-shallotly report this news and just put it out there like it's another
[08:27.520 --> 08:33.560]  day in the jungle it will only serve to further condition myself and everybody
[08:33.560 --> 08:39.440]  else listening to live under this we have to deep down that even an
[08:39.440 --> 08:44.960]  unemotional level commit as part of survival of basic liberty and freedom
[08:44.960 --> 08:51.000]  in our future to bring these criminals to justice because every day I realize
[08:51.000 --> 08:58.840]  more and more I am becoming conditioned I am psychologically losing the battle
[08:58.840 --> 09:05.960]  of the new world order sure as people lose their jobs and get squeezed and go
[09:05.960 --> 09:09.200]  into bankruptcy they're getting upset they're finding out about the new world
[09:09.200 --> 09:12.160]  order they're finding out about the offshore banks how they control the
[09:12.160 --> 09:16.480]  nation and how they ship in the narcotics how they're turning us into a
[09:16.480 --> 09:20.520]  literal prison grid and they own the prison so they make the profit off
[09:20.520 --> 09:27.280]  enslaving us and consolidate the wealth but I see mainstream news stories
[09:27.280 --> 09:32.920]  every day where hospitals want to inject babies with chips so when they come
[09:32.920 --> 09:36.920]  back for doctors visits there's a whole record of their shots and doctors want
[09:36.920 --> 09:43.880]  their you know people that have diabetes and other things to swallow microchips
[09:43.880 --> 09:48.240]  that stay in your intestines that they can then scan you and you know read what
[09:48.240 --> 09:53.320]  you're doing and track you for your safety of course and governments are
[09:53.320 --> 09:57.000]  trying to make military and police take the chips and mainstream news says
[09:57.000 --> 10:02.120]  they're doing test programs of US forces being made to take chips and the
[10:02.120 --> 10:08.760]  Mexican Attorney General's employees to take chips and then it's so old news for
[10:08.760 --> 10:13.200]  me you know I read army documents from the 80s in the mid 90s now they were
[10:13.200 --> 10:17.840]  planning to roll this out and then the army war college in 2000 said that in
[10:17.840 --> 10:20.760]  the future they would make all the troops take chips and how soon they
[10:20.760 --> 10:24.960]  would replace the entire Air Force with drones and then even if the military
[10:24.960 --> 10:28.400]  wouldn't take wouldn't follow orders the elite can carry out whatever
[10:28.400 --> 10:36.480]  operations they want removing that decision-making process from the troops
[10:36.480 --> 10:42.760]  everything's becoming centralized and you know more and more I don't focus in
[10:42.760 --> 10:58.320]  on the very key structures of the architecture of the New World Order so
[11:00.680 --> 11:06.360]  I need to spend more time on the overall master plan of the New World Order and
[11:06.360 --> 11:12.440]  then we can go through and dissect and analyze key components in the overall
[11:12.440 --> 11:21.160]  structure but I tend to focus in on this sector that sector a little little
[11:21.160 --> 11:29.840]  pieces of it it's more important to focus in on the larger overarching program
[11:30.840 --> 11:36.520]  or to bring in more balance in that area
[11:36.520 --> 11:45.040]  if I come on this show and just focus on little parts of the scientific
[11:45.040 --> 11:52.240]  dictatorship the final revolution is the elite call it we do a disservice and
[11:52.240 --> 11:59.160]  you know a lot of people tune into the show and even though I'm giving all my
[11:59.160 --> 12:08.680]  sources to the points I cover it's so horrifying and scary that people want to
[12:08.680 --> 12:12.840]  go into cognitive dissidents and deny the reality and the validity of what
[12:12.840 --> 12:17.120]  we're discussing historically and what's admittedly currently happening
[12:17.120 --> 12:22.520]  because it is frightening to face this so that's one side of people with one
[12:22.520 --> 12:28.360]  side out there who are just in denial then there's people like myself who live
[12:28.360 --> 12:33.800]  close to this every day and constantly study it and it's kind of like somebody
[12:33.800 --> 12:37.760]  who works in a morgue for 20 years whereas your first day on the job you're
[12:37.760 --> 12:42.280]  vomiting or the first time you know you're in you know you're taking anatomy
[12:42.280 --> 12:49.000]  I guess in medical school and they you know bring out the cadaver and you know
[12:49.000 --> 12:53.320]  you and it's in the formaldehyde and you're looking at some old dead woman
[12:53.320 --> 13:00.320]  you throw up but the 50th time you see the old dead woman it's like seeing an
[13:00.320 --> 13:09.520]  old friend and I've never experienced anything like that but talking to my
[13:09.520 --> 13:13.960]  dad who took anatomy you know he was going to school to be a dentist they
[13:13.960 --> 13:18.000]  still do the whole anatomy and his descriptions of it and talking to other
[13:18.000 --> 13:25.200]  physicians I got a small glimpse into that for several years working for a
[13:25.200 --> 13:31.040]  large animal vet part-time and then full-time on the summers doing cesarean
[13:31.040 --> 13:38.280]  sections on cows you'd pull up the calf it already be dead its feet would be
[13:38.280 --> 13:45.200]  sticking out of her you had maybe 20 30 minutes to save the cow and so you'd
[13:45.200 --> 13:52.240]  she'd be in distress you'd lasso her tire down and then you'd with fire ants
[13:52.240 --> 13:58.240]  crawling up your legs stinging your fire ants all over her and after you'd done
[13:58.240 --> 14:05.960]  15 20 30 of these the vet would throw you a scalpel and say hurry she's about to
[14:05.960 --> 14:09.520]  die follow what I'm doing and because it's big incision I cut through three
[14:09.520 --> 14:13.880]  or four layers and the vets cussing at you while it's going on and you're
[14:13.880 --> 14:22.160]  slicing go through the layers no this way and then you're in there and you're
[14:22.160 --> 14:25.440]  pulling the calf out from the inside and you're showing her back up the
[14:25.440 --> 14:28.000]  different layers
[14:32.560 --> 14:42.680]  well after you've done that 50 60 times it's it's nothing and that's what's
[14:42.680 --> 14:47.080]  happening to all of us with this new world order they knowingly take us and
[14:47.080 --> 14:52.000]  give us baptisms and evil what do you think all the violence and murder and
[14:52.000 --> 14:57.320]  stuff on television does they have the studies literally thousands nothing's
[14:57.320 --> 15:02.320]  been studied more than psychology and association with television and with the
[15:02.320 --> 15:08.920]  advent of television and violence slowly being introduced on television people
[15:08.920 --> 15:13.400]  got conditioned to accept it it wasn't that people 50 60 years ago were wimps
[15:13.400 --> 15:18.400]  and didn't like seeing somebody being machine gunned on TV even though it was
[15:18.400 --> 15:23.960]  fake they would become upset because they were in the real world their their
[15:23.960 --> 15:29.280]  brain saw that as real that's why people 50 years ago 60 years ago in combat
[15:29.280 --> 15:32.280]  first time they killed somebody the first four or five times they killed
[15:32.280 --> 15:36.120]  somebody up close they might have gone through special forces training for it
[15:36.120 --> 15:42.720]  but when they really ran up to somebody grabbed them around the mouth slit their
[15:42.720 --> 15:57.560]  throat all the way through the larynx and the esophagus and the trachea and the
[15:57.560 --> 16:03.160]  soldier smells the person's bowels release you know that smell of death the
[16:03.160 --> 16:08.160]  the human mind associates that with your own death and the soldier will you
[16:08.160 --> 16:16.840]  keep going under adrenaline but probably vomit a little bit but soon they do it
[16:16.840 --> 16:29.800]  enough why it becomes something they like and so the CIA by design released the
[16:29.800 --> 16:35.320]  Abu Ghraib photos first it was humiliation of the people to to sell
[16:35.320 --> 16:39.440]  the public on liking it and you know right at the fever pitch right when
[16:39.440 --> 16:44.320]  everybody was so upset and afraid of al Qaeda the Romans wrote about how they
[16:44.320 --> 16:49.240]  would show gladiatorial events and citizens being torn apart by lions and
[16:49.240 --> 16:53.800]  bears and gladiators so that next week when your neighbor was in the pit or you
[16:53.800 --> 16:59.080]  were in the pit your friends and family wouldn't care your own slavery cheering
[16:59.080 --> 17:03.560]  your own dehumanization and so the advent of violence on television you see the
[17:03.560 --> 17:07.880]  crime rate start increasing because people then didn't have that inhibition
[17:07.880 --> 17:14.160]  anymore to kill whereas before if somebody lost their job and was depressed
[17:14.160 --> 17:18.400]  and had a chemical imbalance or something they go jump off a building or a
[17:18.400 --> 17:24.360]  cliff now the idea is introduced in culture and hype no I'm gonna go shoot a
[17:24.360 --> 17:30.360]  bunch of people and the military develop pop-up targets of people were
[17:30.360 --> 17:35.080]  instinctive killing they found in world war two people shooting bomb folks a
[17:35.080 --> 17:42.440]  hundred yards away they'd mortar people 200 yards away but they didn't they
[17:42.440 --> 17:45.960]  didn't like shooting people five feet away and the Germans and the Russians
[17:45.960 --> 17:49.440]  and the Americans and the Japanese were all the same somebody were five feet
[17:49.440 --> 17:55.600]  away that's another human being they would hesitate and the saying is you
[17:55.600 --> 18:00.200]  will hesitate if your killer instinct is not strong you will hesitate and you
[18:00.200 --> 18:09.280]  will be dead marine so they began the paper targets of people the image of a
[18:09.280 --> 18:14.200]  person they said my gosh we've gone from 50% not killing to only 30% not
[18:14.200 --> 18:19.840]  killing and then in the 70s they developed these virtual reality systems
[18:19.840 --> 18:24.640]  with you know videos they would shoot at with lasers and other things and then
[18:24.640 --> 18:31.040]  doom was a government video game program and then they dehumanize the human
[18:31.040 --> 18:34.800]  targets whether goblin like monsters you're killing and again it's the
[18:34.800 --> 18:39.480]  abortion the 50 million dead babies all of this we're being trained so that's
[18:39.480 --> 18:43.840]  why 50 years ago if somebody saw another fellow human killed on video or on film
[18:43.840 --> 18:47.440]  they would get upset now people don't get upset even old ladies don't get upset
[18:47.440 --> 18:51.720]  because they've seen the simulated murders a million times but if they see a
[18:51.720 --> 18:58.680]  dog getting killed by Marines and see that was a fetish by the Marines those

[21:25.240 --> 21:29.600]  you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who
[21:29.600 --> 21:34.880]  is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs

[21:57.480 --> 22:02.720]  strike back hello Ted Anderson listeners of the network are familiar with the
[22:02.720 --> 22:06.680]  federal reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending therefore with
[22:06.680 --> 22:10.400]  catastrophic events it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently
[22:10.400 --> 22:13.880]  place limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts
[22:13.880 --> 22:17.880]  a fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held
[22:17.880 --> 22:21.320]  in reserve for immediate withdrawal deficit spending will skyrocket through
[22:21.320 --> 22:25.000]  FDIC if the government is forced to ensure deposits during a bank run
[22:25.000 --> 22:28.800]  followed by a depressed economy a current effort is underway by the Fed
[22:28.800 --> 22:32.840]  along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors however
[22:32.840 --> 22:36.640]  an increase in money supply without equal expansion and productivity can cause
[22:36.640 --> 22:40.440]  inflation in order to achieve strength and stability I recommend a
[22:40.440 --> 22:44.880]  conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and
[22:44.880 --> 22:49.560]  silver while paper investments currently have been driven by debt gold on its own

[25:37.080 --> 25:42.080]  All right ladies and gentlemen we are back live but this is not a game this is not a
[25:42.080 --> 25:52.080]  movie this is not a fairy tale framed in another galaxy in another millennium a
[25:52.080 --> 25:59.080]  long time ago this is happening now and this is what tyrants that engage in the
[25:59.080 --> 26:03.080]  dark arts of world government and evil are into.
[26:03.080 --> 26:09.080]  They are seducing you with all the TV shows movies homeland security gave awards
[26:09.080 --> 26:15.080]  and had award ceremonies and admitted that 24 was their propaganda show with
[26:15.080 --> 26:19.080]  government funding this is on record and all these other copycat shows with
[26:19.080 --> 26:20.080]  government funding.
[26:20.080 --> 26:24.080]  All of these other episodes after episodes shows in England shows in
[26:24.080 --> 26:29.080]  France shows in Germany where they tortured children in front of their
[26:29.080 --> 26:34.080]  parents and I'll never forget right before 9-11 I was in 7-11 and there was
[26:34.080 --> 26:39.080]  a magazine I think it was weapons and technology of law enforcement in April
[26:39.080 --> 26:44.080]  issue I'll never forget and I grabbed it and I rarely buy those and I opened it
[26:44.080 --> 26:49.080]  with these former special forces people explaining to cops what do you do with
[26:49.080 --> 26:53.080]  anthrax bombs are going to go off in major cities and you've got to torture
[26:53.080 --> 26:58.080]  someone's child in front of them to save tens of thousands and the police made
[26:58.080 --> 27:01.080]  the decision in it to torture children.
[27:01.080 --> 27:11.080]  Now see they were pre-programming you to find the cadres they need.
[27:11.080 --> 27:18.080]  They were pre-programming you and then simultaneously with TV shows after 9-11
[27:18.080 --> 27:23.080]  at the height of your fear they would show torture being good then they would
[27:23.080 --> 27:26.080]  release humiliating photos of the lighter stuff.
[27:26.080 --> 27:32.080]  The Army's own report by General Tugumbo three star general for the army stated
[27:32.080 --> 27:37.080]  that they would put acid on objects and rape people they would rape children
[27:37.080 --> 27:42.080]  in front of their parents you can read the army report this Google army report
[27:42.080 --> 27:47.080]  on torture it reported 97% of those were completely innocent on the face of it
[27:47.080 --> 27:51.080]  picked up at checkpoints for not having their papers in order and taken to Abu
[27:51.080 --> 27:56.080]  Ghaib alone that was one of 30 plus torture camps.
[27:56.080 --> 28:01.080]  But again this is your journey to the dark side oh the baby's a blob of flesh
[28:01.080 --> 28:06.080]  have the abortion oh let's go ahead and euthanize the old it's their right
[28:06.080 --> 28:10.080]  government makes them die and the Wall Street Journal admits their chain down
[28:10.080 --> 28:13.080]  begging for food and water and we list their names that we know about the
[28:13.080 --> 28:16.080]  hundreds who are killed when the state gets them they chain the old people down
[28:16.080 --> 28:20.080]  and take their water and food away but when they advertise to the public
[28:20.080 --> 28:23.080]  they show the poor girl in Florida where you could debate whether she was
[28:23.080 --> 28:30.080]  brain dead or not to again make it look like it was reasonable but then they
[28:30.080 --> 28:33.080]  ignore all the cases of those chain down begging for food and water.
[28:33.080 --> 28:38.080]  We are in a very wicked society we are in collapse controlled collapse
[28:38.080 --> 28:46.080]  and I was reading this morning these headlines Obama shield CIA officers
[28:46.080 --> 28:51.080]  over US torture this is from French news agency now it's being spun here that
[28:51.080 --> 28:55.080]  he's gotten tough releasing the memos no he's releasing the memos and saying
[28:55.080 --> 29:00.080]  we have to protect the people that followed orders and that is the
[29:00.080 --> 29:09.080]  Nuremberg defense that's what the Nazis said we were just following orders and
[29:09.080 --> 29:15.080]  of course that was a fraud and so now they say they're engaging in all this
[29:15.080 --> 29:23.080]  tyranny just following orders and Obama saying yes Obama saying yes we can play
[29:23.080 --> 29:30.080]  a speech yesterday he's saying yes because they were following orders they
[29:30.080 --> 29:36.080]  are immune he is actually saying Nuremberg was wrong he's saying Adolf
[29:36.080 --> 29:43.080]  Alois Hitler and Joseph Stalin were right and Mao Zedong so he's shutting
[29:43.080 --> 29:48.080]  the precedent but they admit the type of torture but then they lie and say
[29:48.080 --> 29:51.080]  it's not torture we'll list the torture when we get back.
[29:51.080 --> 29:58.080]  We're on the march the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[34:14.080 --> 34:24.080]  own babies grave digger grave digger when you dig my grave could you make it a shallow
[34:24.080 --> 34:29.080]  so well that's what we know soon he needs no introduction from the emblem of
[34:29.080 --> 34:34.080]  grave digger grave digger okay let's get right back into this and I want to go to
[34:34.080 --> 34:37.080]  your phone calls
[34:37.080 --> 34:46.080]  and then coming up Obama appointee wants Soviet style media and no we're not
[34:46.080 --> 34:51.080]  joking they're actually announcing it taking over licensing won't be allowed
[34:51.080 --> 34:55.080]  to have a blog without a license from the government I mean you don't think J
[34:55.080 --> 34:58.080]  Rockefeller is getting up at the Senate saying they want to shut down the web and
[34:58.080 --> 35:01.080]  then we'd be better off without it you don't think the feds are running around
[35:01.080 --> 35:06.080]  hacking through computer systems taking over TV stations and messing up power
[35:06.080 --> 35:10.080]  issues to blame it on the Chinese for nothing
[35:10.080 --> 35:15.080]  or passing a bill for the NSA and the feds the head of cybersecurity resigned
[35:15.080 --> 35:19.080]  Obama's appointee saying they're taking over it's a police state
[35:19.080 --> 35:23.080]  yeah they mean business you think they're just going to steal your 401ks and
[35:23.080 --> 35:26.080]  then sit there and let you come after them
[35:26.080 --> 35:31.080]  no they're going to bring in hot tyranny they didn't start advertising out
[35:31.080 --> 35:33.080]  tortures a new virtue
[35:33.080 --> 35:37.080]  they were planning to sit on their hands
[35:37.080 --> 35:42.080]  they planned to have a bloody orgy
[35:42.080 --> 35:46.080]  because that's what they do so that's coming up
[35:46.080 --> 35:50.080]  YouTube's announcing they're going to relegate all the user videos to a hidden
[35:50.080 --> 35:57.080]  subpage just like they did with Google video you can't even find
[35:57.080 --> 36:02.080]  the top 100 and things anymore so that's coming up
[36:02.080 --> 36:06.080]  okay so the control corporate press in the U.S. most of them Obermann's admitting the truth
[36:06.080 --> 36:10.080]  and saying that Obama's doing a horrible thing
[36:10.080 --> 36:14.080]  but the rest of the press is man look at Obama he released the Bush torture memos
[36:14.080 --> 36:22.080]  yeah and said we're setting the precedent to protect those that followed orders to do this
[36:22.080 --> 36:25.080]  and folks dunking somebody's head in a bucket
[36:25.080 --> 36:29.080]  they always show you the field waterboarding where they stick a rag over their face
[36:29.080 --> 36:33.080]  with water on it which starts the process of grounding
[36:33.080 --> 36:40.080]  but the real waterboarding is when they put you up on a stretcher
[36:40.080 --> 36:44.080]  lean you to an angle and stick your head in the water
[36:44.080 --> 36:48.080]  and the CIA brags what they do in their more advanced laboratories
[36:48.080 --> 36:51.080]  they've even bragged a few times on Fox News
[36:51.080 --> 36:54.080]  they've got drugs that stop your heart for a minute or so
[36:54.080 --> 36:57.080]  so you're wide awake with your eyes wide open
[36:57.080 --> 37:01.080]  and they stop your heart and then that really gets folks to panic and talk
[37:01.080 --> 37:06.080]  I got a clip of that in police state three total enslavement
[37:06.080 --> 37:08.080]  where they're bragging about it
[37:08.080 --> 37:10.080]  see back when they just staged their terror attacks
[37:10.080 --> 37:15.080]  they thought they had you sold so they came right out with it and said yeah we're torturing kids
[37:15.080 --> 37:20.080]  we take acid and we rape them with acid objects
[37:20.080 --> 37:26.080]  I mean that's what they do I mean that's that's Jeffrey Dahmer
[37:26.080 --> 37:31.080]  you know trying to bring you over the dark side
[37:31.080 --> 37:33.080]  to burn out the good in you
[37:33.080 --> 37:38.080]  you sit there with popcorn watching Jack Bauer
[37:38.080 --> 37:42.080]  all these soft ninnies
[37:42.080 --> 37:46.080]  getting off on it
[37:46.080 --> 37:55.080]  but that torture they're searing your conscience so you can be tortured you fools
[37:55.080 --> 38:03.080]  Obama shields CIA officers over US torture
[38:03.080 --> 38:05.080]  agency French press
[38:05.080 --> 38:10.080]  US President Barack Obama has assured CIA agents involved in tough
[38:10.080 --> 38:11.080]  look at tough
[38:11.080 --> 38:16.080]  people read that and go I'm an American I'm tough
[38:16.080 --> 38:19.080]  terror interrogations he's not tortured
[38:19.080 --> 38:23.080]  they will not be prosecuted as he released graphic memos detailing methods
[38:23.080 --> 38:27.080]  approved by the Bush White House
[38:27.080 --> 38:29.080]  now let me
[38:29.080 --> 38:36.080]  for you
[38:36.080 --> 38:39.080]  go over
[38:39.080 --> 38:43.080]  the forms of torture
[38:43.080 --> 38:45.080]  which they're going to continue
[38:45.080 --> 38:49.080]  CIA interrogation tax redefine print all this is going to continue
[38:49.080 --> 38:51.080]  a terrifying ordeal
[38:51.080 --> 38:55.080]  some of this from past articles where they admitted what happens I can't read it
[38:55.080 --> 38:58.080]  and they say oh it's just psychological
[38:58.080 --> 39:01.080]  you know they drug the guy up
[39:01.080 --> 39:04.080]  they send in naked women and they start
[39:04.080 --> 39:07.080]  throwing blood all over them and enchanting Satan and Arabic
[39:07.080 --> 39:11.080]  that that's that's been in past articles and I can't say what else they do
[39:11.080 --> 39:18.080]  and I mean this would freak any person out
[39:18.080 --> 39:21.080]  or they put them on drugs and then they wake up and they're dancing around in
[39:21.080 --> 39:26.080]  devil outfits or they put their head in cages with rats right out of 1984
[39:26.080 --> 39:30.080]  with a with a rabid rat you know starving rat hissing and scratching
[39:30.080 --> 39:33.080]  on the other side room 101 they do that
[39:33.080 --> 39:37.080]  they put in in cages with spiders I told you all this
[39:37.080 --> 39:41.080]  so the detainees said they were doing to him now it's admitted
[39:41.080 --> 39:43.080]  and then they ask
[39:43.080 --> 39:47.080]  is it torture
[39:47.080 --> 39:51.080]  180 hours let me see there's 24 hours in a day
[39:51.080 --> 39:55.080]  what's a hundred what's what's 24 divided into
[39:55.080 --> 40:03.080]  180 how many days is that
[40:03.080 --> 40:05.080]  listen to this
[40:05.080 --> 40:09.080]  CIA interrogation tactics a terrifying ordeal this is land of the free home of the brave
[40:09.080 --> 40:14.080]  we had to get tough after they hit us on 9 11
[40:14.080 --> 40:17.080]  oh yeah they had us
[40:17.080 --> 40:22.080]  the journey into the CIA's most extreme interrogation program began in darkness
[40:22.080 --> 40:29.080]  blindfolded hooded and wearing earmuffs suspected terrorists were shackled and flown to secret interrogation centers
[40:29.080 --> 40:32.080]  the buildings themselves were quiet
[40:32.080 --> 40:38.080]  clinical and designed to fill prisoners with dread detainees were shaved stripped and photographed nude
[40:38.080 --> 40:43.080]  all part of the humiliation but again all part of the power trip for those doing it
[40:43.080 --> 40:46.080]  was always pressing on the nerve of power
[40:46.080 --> 40:48.080]  very bestial people
[40:48.080 --> 40:53.080]  the questioning began and will push it calling them professionals and he lick his lips and get this
[40:53.080 --> 40:56.080]  crazy look in his eye and now vanity fair admits
[40:56.080 --> 40:59.080]  in a huge cover story
[40:59.080 --> 41:05.080]  that all they have big homosexual orgies the Christian conservatives at Bohemian Grove exactly what I told you
[41:05.080 --> 41:10.080]  exactly what everybody else has told you they arrested the guy they caught in there
[41:10.080 --> 41:15.080]  so again that's Bush and this is what they like I mean it's reported
[41:15.080 --> 41:21.080]  and of course Bush and Cheney would have the interrogation videos taken to them to be watched at the White House
[41:21.080 --> 41:24.080]  night after night I mean especially the Abu Ghraib with the kids
[41:24.080 --> 41:30.080]  imagine they get to legally sit in there and watch kids being raped their favorite thing
[41:30.080 --> 41:33.080]  and Bush would like to start licking his lips and get that excited look and go
[41:33.080 --> 41:38.080]  the professionals oh the professional it's so professional
[41:38.080 --> 41:44.080]  to go in and torture and rape the children see how they and but again when you get into Satanism
[41:44.080 --> 41:49.080]  and black magic and evil it's the openly announcing it in front of everyone
[41:49.080 --> 41:54.080]  that's the highest level of enjoyment
[41:54.080 --> 41:59.080]  and so that's why Bush would get up and do a little
[41:59.080 --> 42:04.080]  you know niny effeminate little curtsy
[42:04.080 --> 42:08.080]  so he get that little niny look in his eye because that's what psychos do
[42:08.080 --> 42:12.080]  what a Terry Gilliam in Brazil when the guy comes into torture
[42:12.080 --> 42:16.080]  he's wearing a sickening diseased baby face mask
[42:16.080 --> 42:20.080]  see that's the elite letting you know that they know what's really going on
[42:20.080 --> 42:23.080]  and see that's what Bush would kind of make that little baby
[42:23.080 --> 42:27.080]  you know little niny face that little Glenn Beck faces
[42:27.080 --> 42:30.080]  the professionals and he'd enjoy it
[42:30.080 --> 42:34.080]  the professionalism of it all we're so professional in our little
[42:34.080 --> 42:38.080]  our little lab coats and gloves torturing people
[42:38.080 --> 42:42.080]  and it's so professional to go to the Grove
[42:42.080 --> 42:46.080]  and all these old men with all these thousand dollar an hour gay prostitutes in there
[42:46.080 --> 42:50.080]  and it's so professional when they have their own publication
[42:50.080 --> 42:54.080]  New York Post talk about how Chad Savage was servicing them
[42:54.080 --> 42:58.080]  the top gay porn star they like to brag and then Anderson Cooper
[42:58.080 --> 43:02.080]  the heir to the aster fortune and a Bilderberg group
[43:02.080 --> 43:06.080]  CFR, Trilateral Commission, Bohemian Grove member
[43:06.080 --> 43:10.080]  who blew up at me when I brought it up he sits up there licking his lips
[43:10.080 --> 43:14.080]  and they keep giggling repeating the word teabag, teabag, teabag
[43:14.080 --> 43:18.080]  on CNN in front of everybody obsessing on their fetishes
[43:18.080 --> 43:22.080]  obsessing on what they're into and Gergen, the Carl Robe of four administrations giggling
[43:22.080 --> 43:26.080]  and licking his lips and blushing as him and Cooper
[43:26.080 --> 43:30.080]  you know do all this this is who they are orgies
[43:30.080 --> 43:34.080]  Satanism, torture and then openly announcing it
[43:34.080 --> 43:38.080]  to everyone
[43:38.080 --> 43:42.080]  because they believe that increases their power that's why psychos always
[43:42.080 --> 43:46.080]  write letters to the cops taunting them it's it's it's their MO
[43:46.080 --> 43:50.080]  it's their pathology it's their psychology
[43:50.080 --> 43:54.080]  blindfolded hooded and wearing earmuffs suspected terrorist
[43:54.080 --> 43:58.080]  were shackled and flown to secret interrogation centers the buildings themselves were quiet
[43:58.080 --> 44:02.080]  clinical and designed to fill prisoners with dread detainees were shaved
[44:02.080 --> 44:06.080]  stripped and photographed nude the question began mildly and shackled
[44:06.080 --> 44:10.080]  detainee facing a non-threatening CIA interrogator but for detainees who refused
[44:10.080 --> 44:14.080]  to cooperate the interrogation escalated in terrifying ways now you notice
[44:14.080 --> 44:18.080]  that the Vietnamese wouldn't do sexual torture they were above that
[44:18.080 --> 44:22.080]  they would rip your toenails out and torture you and make you stand up for a week
[44:22.080 --> 44:26.080]  and and and and you know do the brutal stuff but see the globalist
[44:26.080 --> 44:30.080]  the western varieties always sexual because
[44:30.080 --> 44:34.080]  these are
[44:34.080 --> 44:38.080]  these are bisexual
[44:38.080 --> 44:42.080]  say no masochistic terrorist
[44:42.080 --> 44:46.080]  it continues few people have ever witnessed the process which was designed
[44:46.080 --> 44:50.080]  to extract secrets from high value suspects during the years
[44:50.080 --> 44:54.080]  after september 11 2001 terrorism attacks on us
[44:54.080 --> 44:58.080]  but justice department documents which the Obama administration simultaneously released
[44:58.080 --> 45:02.080]  and repudiated thursday no they didn't
[45:02.080 --> 45:06.080]  you listen to it carefully it's a legal argument we're going to continue this we're going to protect them
[45:06.080 --> 45:10.080]  describe the process from darkness to
[45:10.080 --> 45:14.080]  waterboarding in skin crawling detail
[45:14.080 --> 45:18.080]  prisoners were naked shackled and hooded to start
[45:18.080 --> 45:22.080]  their interrogation sessions when the CIA interrogator removed the hood the question began
[45:22.080 --> 45:26.080]  whenever the prisoner resisted the documents outlined
[45:26.080 --> 45:30.080]  a series of techniques the CIA could use to bring him back
[45:30.080 --> 45:34.080]  in line nudity sleep deprivation and dietary restrictions kept
[45:34.080 --> 45:38.080]  prisoners compliant
[45:38.080 --> 45:42.080]  and reminded them they had no control over their basic needs so that's why
[45:42.080 --> 45:46.080]  they want you off the farms that's why they want you in compact cities your kids under control
[45:46.080 --> 45:50.080]  when they want that's how they treat everybody they want you under their control
[45:50.080 --> 45:54.080]  so they can take their time with you and
[45:54.080 --> 45:58.080]  enjoy their luxuries those clothes and food could be used as
[45:58.080 --> 46:02.080]  rewards for cooperation all clothes and the freezing temperatures
[46:02.080 --> 46:06.080]  slapping prisoners on the face or abdomen was allowed
[46:06.080 --> 46:10.080]  so was grabbing them forcefully by the collar slapping them into a
[46:10.080 --> 46:14.080]  false wall and remember this is all a whitewash they admit
[46:14.080 --> 46:18.080]  it's been declassified just not getting big attention like taxi
[46:18.080 --> 46:22.080]  the dark side they would beat you for 24 hours straight with four or five guys taking turns
[46:22.080 --> 46:26.080]  until your body liquefied the muscles and
[46:26.080 --> 46:30.080]  fat liquefied and you died and their favorite was like 12-14 year old
[46:30.080 --> 46:34.080]  kids because see they couldn't arrest any real Taliban or Al-Qaeda they're all CIA
[46:34.080 --> 46:38.080]  agents and officers not just assets that's been confirmed
[46:38.080 --> 46:42.080]  they have to grab innocent people and most of them like to rape young men
[46:42.080 --> 46:46.080]  so you know that's why they harm and that's happened they hired federal, former federal
[46:46.080 --> 46:50.080]  jail guards who had lost their jobs for raping that was their main
[46:50.080 --> 46:54.080]  cadre slapping prisoners on the face or abdomen was allowed
[46:54.080 --> 46:58.080]  so was grabbing them forcefully by the collar slapping them into a false wall
[46:58.080 --> 47:02.080]  technique called walling that had a goal
[47:02.080 --> 47:06.080]  of fear more than pain that's another lie
[47:06.080 --> 47:10.080]  water hoses were used to douse the prisoners for minutes at a time
[47:10.080 --> 47:14.080]  and the hoses were turned on and off as the interrogation continued
[47:14.080 --> 47:18.080]  prisoners at freezing naked, prisoners this is what the Vietnamese did
[47:18.080 --> 47:22.080]  North Koreans do, prisoners were put into one of three stress positions
[47:22.080 --> 47:26.080]  such as sitting on the floor with legs out straight and arms raised in the air
[47:26.080 --> 47:30.080]  to cause discomfort and then they would chain you up where you couldn't sit
[47:30.080 --> 47:34.080]  down for a week that night the detainees were shackled standing naked
[47:34.080 --> 47:38.080]  or wearing a diaper
[47:38.080 --> 47:42.080]  the length of sleep deprivation varied by prisoner
[47:42.080 --> 47:46.080]  was authorized for 180 hours so what's 180 hours divided in
[47:46.080 --> 47:50.080]  so that's seven and a half days interrogation sessions range from 30 minutes to several
[47:50.080 --> 47:54.080]  hours can be repeated as necessary as an approved
[47:54.080 --> 47:58.080]  by psychological and medical teams so because it's a doctor just like
[47:58.080 --> 48:02.080]  in the Soviet Union oh it's the doctor it's I'm a doctor I'm a professional
[48:02.080 --> 48:06.080]  it's not torture
[48:06.080 --> 48:10.080]  these techniques such as stripping and detaining naked depriving him of sleep
[48:10.080 --> 48:14.080]  and putting a hood over his head and prohibited as prohibited under the U.S.
[48:14.080 --> 48:18.080]  Army field manual but in 2002 the Justice Department authorized CIA interrogators to step up the pressure
[48:18.080 --> 48:22.080]  even further on suspected terrorist Abu
[48:22.080 --> 48:26.080]  Zabudai and remember
[48:26.080 --> 48:30.080]  Sheikh Mohammed they said will hurt your kid so he went ahead and said okay I bombed everything
[48:30.080 --> 48:34.080]  buildings that weren't built till four years after he was captured
[48:34.080 --> 48:38.080]  Justice Department lawyers at CIA could place him in a cramped confined box
[48:38.080 --> 48:42.080]  that's what the Vietnamese did our troops but see that's torture when we do it to us
[48:42.080 --> 48:46.080]  but it's good in pro America we do it because he
[48:46.080 --> 48:50.080]  appeared afraid of insects they also authorized interrogators to place him in a box
[48:50.080 --> 48:54.080]  and fill the box with caterpillars
[48:54.080 --> 48:58.080]  finally the Justice Department authorized interrogators to take the step
[48:58.080 --> 49:02.080]  into what the United States now considers torture waterboarding
[49:02.080 --> 49:06.080]  oh because the government said it wasn't torture it wasn't but when they say
[49:06.080 --> 49:10.080]  it is torture it is like they control reality I'll never forget the
[49:10.080 --> 49:14.080]  White House Press Secretary eight nine months ago Bush's Secretary Perino
[49:14.080 --> 49:18.080]  and they were saying is it true the dollars being devalued is it true is it true
[49:18.080 --> 49:22.080]  that that the currencies can be devalued like is it true the sun comes
[49:22.080 --> 49:26.080]  up and she said I can't answer that I'd lose my job and they said okay
[49:26.080 --> 49:30.080]  is it true if I jump off a cliff I might get hurt
[49:30.080 --> 49:34.080]  is it true mommy that Santa isn't real
[49:38.080 --> 49:42.080]  the Bush administration approved of waterboarding a technique used was strapped to a board
[49:42.080 --> 49:46.080]  his feet raised up of his head his face was covered with a wet cloth as interrogators poured
[49:46.080 --> 49:50.080]  water over it the body responds as if it's drowning over and over again the process
[49:50.080 --> 49:54.080]  repeated it's not like you're drowning you're suffocating the
[49:54.080 --> 49:58.080]  you can't get air through the cloth
[49:58.080 --> 50:03.080]  and they publicly teach all the troops in special forces how to do this in
[50:03.080 --> 50:08.080]  interrogations I mean it's it's taught
[50:08.080 --> 50:14.080]  so see this is how you're being introduced to all of this
[50:14.080 --> 50:18.080]  now meanwhile there was a reporter who wanted to
[50:18.080 --> 50:22.080]  go into a meeting to ask Kerry Kerry Kerry questions
[50:22.080 --> 50:26.080]  yesterday it's up on info wars.com and the police come over
[50:26.080 --> 50:30.080]  and he's a reporter and he's waiting outside and they say no you got to leave
[50:30.080 --> 50:34.080]  the university grounds and he said but this is open I just want to talk to her when she comes out
[50:34.080 --> 50:38.080]  and they said no so they grab him and start twisting his arm behind his back and they say
[50:38.080 --> 50:42.080]  sir we'll quit twisting if you leave see that's torture and I have
[50:42.080 --> 50:46.080]  footage of police we're going to play it later when we're live at prisonplanet.tv
[50:46.080 --> 50:50.080]  of them breaking pro-lifers and other people's arms with compound fractures
[50:50.080 --> 50:54.080]  and the judges say that's completely legal now if you don't think bones sticking
[50:54.080 --> 50:58.080]  out of your body is tortured see we're
[50:58.080 --> 51:02.080]  treated worse than supposed alt-item
[51:02.080 --> 51:06.080]  you are a rebel admit it you refuse to read the directions when assembling a new item
[51:06.080 --> 51:10.080]  you won't ask for directions when you're lost once in a while you drive
[51:10.080 --> 51:14.080]  in the carpool lane with only you in the car your neighbors call you a crackpot
[51:14.080 --> 51:18.080]  and you can count your real friends on one hand well join the club
[51:18.080 --> 51:22.080]  Einstein failed math quit school and his rebel ideas led to
[51:22.080 --> 51:26.080]  some of the world's most amazing discoveries Edison rebelled against the dark
[51:26.080 --> 51:30.080]  failed over a thousand times then invented the light bulb George Washington
[51:30.080 --> 51:34.080]  rebelled against an entire country and led the creation of a new one

[54:22.080 --> 54:26.080]  I will go directly to calls
[54:26.080 --> 54:30.080]  from Scott, Eddie, Tito, John, Robert, Paul
[54:30.080 --> 54:34.080]  and others I promise got a ton of news after that on the attacks on the first amendment
[54:34.080 --> 54:38.080]  that are being openly announced by the White House
[54:38.080 --> 54:42.080]  Tito wanting our guns
[54:42.080 --> 54:46.080]  how that attack is materializing a lot more coming up in this segment and the next
[54:46.080 --> 54:50.080]  I want to bring Steve Shank up because
[54:50.080 --> 54:54.080]  he's the biggest horrible foods company in the country the highest quality
[54:54.080 --> 54:58.080]  non-GMO non-hybrided
[54:58.080 --> 55:02.080]  the longest continually operating a great guy and
[55:02.080 --> 55:06.080]  I've got mainstream news here with the IMF and World Bank saying we are in a depression
[55:06.080 --> 55:10.080]  now let's say there's a 20% chance it's probably much worse than that that everything's going to collapse
[55:10.080 --> 55:14.080]  90% of us were self-sufficient
[55:14.080 --> 55:18.080]  during the Great Depression for 10 years and 7 million according to major university studies
[55:18.080 --> 55:22.080]  you can Google that 7 million starved during Great Depression you'll get the mainstream news articles
[55:22.080 --> 55:26.080]  and 7 million people starved to death. The globalists want to use food as a
[55:26.080 --> 55:30.080]  weapon they brag about it constantly you need to have food, water filters
[55:30.080 --> 55:34.080]  firearms things like that and this is the place to get the water filters
[55:34.080 --> 55:38.080]  the storeable food they got it all. So I want to bring Steve Shank up in this segment and the next
[55:38.080 --> 55:42.080]  to give us a report on what's happening because as he reported
[55:42.080 --> 55:46.080]  6 months ago now it's mainstream news because he's a big food buyer so he knows
[55:46.080 --> 55:50.080]  now it's in the news that a lot of farmers aren't even planning because they're so broke
[55:50.080 --> 55:54.080]  and can't get credit. Steve Shank good to have you here. Hey it's great to be
[55:54.080 --> 55:58.080]  aboard Alex. Tell folks what's going on. Well
[55:58.080 --> 56:02.080]  I'll tell you what we have you know
[56:02.080 --> 56:06.080]  we say that there are three times when you can tell somebody's lying
[56:06.080 --> 56:10.080]  number one when the checks in the mail
[56:10.080 --> 56:14.080]  number two I'll respect you in the morning and number three I'm from the government
[56:14.080 --> 56:18.080]  I'm here to help. The fact is that we've got
[56:18.080 --> 56:22.080]  we've got a new bill and I know that you've been
[56:22.080 --> 56:26.080]  telling people about this this HR 45 the gun safety
[56:26.080 --> 56:30.080]  and we've been talking somewhat about HR
[56:30.080 --> 56:34.080]  75 the food safety bills
[56:34.080 --> 56:38.080]  that they're trying to ramrod through and these two have
[56:38.080 --> 56:42.080]  similar issues they are going to
[56:42.080 --> 56:46.080]  severely restrict the ability of our people
[56:46.080 --> 56:50.080]  to be able to function as we as Americans have functioned
[56:50.080 --> 56:54.080]  the right to life which is food liberty
[56:54.080 --> 56:58.080]  which is protecting ourselves and the pursuit
[56:58.080 --> 57:02.080]  of happiness are right on the line right now and it
[57:02.080 --> 57:06.080]  all comes down to what you've been talking about and what you and I've talked about
[57:06.080 --> 57:10.080]  for just almost years now very
[57:10.080 --> 57:14.080]  simply what we've got going on is an attack on the ability of
[57:14.080 --> 57:18.080]  people to exist literally in this country
[57:18.080 --> 57:22.080]  now I know that you've come up with this you know you've mentioned
[57:22.080 --> 57:26.080]  a great deal about this HR 45 that is being
[57:26.080 --> 57:30.080]  promulgated by this
[57:30.080 --> 57:34.080]  this ex black panther this Bobby Rush
[57:34.080 --> 57:38.080]  and you know what does all this have to do
[57:38.080 --> 57:42.080]  with food and the things that you and I talk about with people being able to
[57:42.080 --> 57:46.080]  to live the bill this
[57:46.080 --> 57:50.080]  875 is requiring the kind
[57:50.080 --> 57:54.080]  of reporting and the kind of the checks and balances
[57:54.080 --> 57:58.080]  that where people can be evaluated at any
[57:58.080 --> 58:02.080]  point in time and if any any possible
[58:02.080 --> 58:06.080]  contamination if one little cell of
[58:06.080 --> 58:10.080]  salmonella is found on a tomato the people can
[58:10.080 --> 58:14.080]  be fined their property can be taken away and these are extreme
[58:14.080 --> 58:18.080]  now neither of these bills have been passed yet Alex but the fact is that
[58:18.080 --> 58:22.080]  that somebody is thinking about this well during crises they can get away
[58:22.080 --> 58:26.080]  with almost anything they're openly announcing they want to register
[58:26.080 --> 58:30.080]  everybody and fine and fee everyone to have government approved media
[58:30.080 --> 58:34.080]  that's in the LA Times so a lot of crazy things are happening
[58:34.080 --> 58:38.080]  Steve stay there we'll be back in 70 seconds with a second hour with Steve Shane

[1:01:40.080 --> 1:01:44.080]  but let's step aside from this
[1:01:44.080 --> 1:01:48.080]  this gun bill which if your listeners
[1:01:48.080 --> 1:01:52.080]  would like we have a very good researcher
[1:01:52.080 --> 1:01:56.080]  we're going to be putting up a summary of what's going on with
[1:01:56.080 --> 1:02:00.080]  the safety food and the safety gun issue up on
[1:02:00.080 --> 1:02:04.080]  eFoodsDirect.com that will be appearing
[1:02:04.080 --> 1:02:08.080]  tomorrow we're just in the process of formulating what we want
[1:02:08.080 --> 1:02:12.080]  to put up but let's go to the food bill
[1:02:12.080 --> 1:02:16.080]  this HR875 in a country where
[1:02:16.080 --> 1:02:20.080]  we're importing 30% of our food and the
[1:02:20.080 --> 1:02:24.080]  contaminations from the Chinese just continue to roll on and
[1:02:24.080 --> 1:02:28.080]  on and on Alex
[1:02:28.080 --> 1:02:32.080]  we could just spend a whole show on that mess but in a country where
[1:02:32.080 --> 1:02:36.080]  our country where we don't grow enough food as it is
[1:02:36.080 --> 1:02:40.080]  the major agricorps Monsanto
[1:02:40.080 --> 1:02:44.080]  and Tyson chicken and these are the ones that
[1:02:44.080 --> 1:02:48.080]  are pushing for this control bill this
[1:02:48.080 --> 1:02:52.080]  food safety thing because it will shut down the small farmers and ranchers
[1:02:52.080 --> 1:02:56.080]  they are SWAT teaming and I'm not just saying that you can google it
[1:02:56.080 --> 1:03:00.080]  Amish roadside watermelon sellers they are
[1:03:00.080 --> 1:03:04.080]  really trying to crack down on what's left of our rural areas
[1:03:04.080 --> 1:03:08.080]  and also what's left of the food that's edible
[1:03:08.080 --> 1:03:12.080]  you got to understand the people that develop these genetically altered foods
[1:03:12.080 --> 1:03:16.080]  that will make you glow in the dark walks sideways and one eye travel to the other side of your head
[1:03:16.080 --> 1:03:20.080]  are the big agricorps it's all economically
[1:03:20.080 --> 1:03:24.080]  forced and run
[1:03:24.080 --> 1:03:28.080]  I believe they've been planting a lot of these releases that have happened in hyping it up
[1:03:28.080 --> 1:03:32.080]  to distract from the poison coming in from Mexico and China so they could get
[1:03:32.080 --> 1:03:36.080]  these regulations I mean they've been caught doing this before
[1:03:36.080 --> 1:03:40.080]  I'm going to hold you over because I want you to give the number on the other side because I'm interrupting here
[1:03:40.080 --> 1:03:44.080]  but this is key folks they were caught in Australia the government admits they accidentally
[1:03:44.080 --> 1:03:48.080]  released the horse flu that shut everything down the government accidentally
[1:03:48.080 --> 1:03:52.080]  released in England the foot and mouth that shut everything down
[1:03:52.080 --> 1:03:56.080]  accidentally at all these sites all over England in a two day
[1:03:56.080 --> 1:04:00.080]  period 50 something sites no they're doing this on purpose and then
[1:04:00.080 --> 1:04:04.080]  they target the farms the ranches as if the animal ID
[1:04:04.080 --> 1:04:08.080]  and the premises ID isn't shutting things down bad enough Steve they're now
[1:04:08.080 --> 1:04:12.080]  coming up with this and on the gun bill that bill was introduced
[1:04:12.080 --> 1:04:16.080]  by the White House Chief of Staff when he was a congressman last
[1:04:16.080 --> 1:04:20.080]  year and they got another bill that will allow the Attorney General to ban any guns
[1:04:20.080 --> 1:04:24.080]  whenever he feels like it that just gives him a blank check so
[1:04:24.080 --> 1:04:28.080]  they're coming down on us hot and heavy Steve and as you know as things
[1:04:28.080 --> 1:04:32.080]  implode this is going to happen efoodsdirect.com the letter E foods

[1:06:38.080 --> 1:06:42.080]  it's not about left or right it's about a one world government
[1:06:42.080 --> 1:06:46.080]  this film documents who Obama works for the lies he is told

[1:08:06.080 --> 1:08:10.080]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[1:08:10.080 --> 1:08:14.080]  Bob Chapman coming up in about 15 minutes and then in the next hour I'm going to play one of the extras for my film
[1:08:14.080 --> 1:08:18.080]  martial law where police around the country
[1:08:18.080 --> 1:08:22.080]  the federal courts say are legally allowed
[1:08:22.080 --> 1:08:26.080]  to break your arms and legs with bones sticking out
[1:08:26.080 --> 1:08:30.080]  and blood pouring out
[1:08:30.080 --> 1:08:34.080]  they call it pain compliance not torture so see the only reason
[1:08:34.080 --> 1:08:38.080]  they're trying to sell torture to the public is so you can be tortured that's what tasers are
[1:08:38.080 --> 1:08:42.080]  now they use them properly when somebody's attacking them that's one issue
[1:08:42.080 --> 1:08:46.080]  that's sort of the gun but if it's used for compliance oh you didn't
[1:08:46.080 --> 1:08:50.080]  walk down the line like I said at the DWI checkpoint I'm going to taser you
[1:08:50.080 --> 1:08:54.080]  you didn't give a urine sample at the jail cell I'm going to taser you
[1:08:54.080 --> 1:08:58.080]  that is torture so that's coming up as well your phone calls first
[1:08:58.080 --> 1:09:02.080]  going back to Steve shank
[1:09:02.080 --> 1:09:06.080]  Steve again look bottom line folks need to ignore the government
[1:09:06.080 --> 1:09:10.080]  saying you know that they shouldn't gardener whatever did you see
[1:09:10.080 --> 1:09:14.080]  council up in Tulsa, Oklahoma said we can't trust the citizens
[1:09:14.080 --> 1:09:18.080]  to have gardens in the newspaper because they might grow marijuana see how
[1:09:18.080 --> 1:09:22.080]  we're now guilty until proven innocent I mean even prisoners in a super
[1:09:22.080 --> 1:09:26.080]  you know in a prison are allowed to have a plant in their cell
[1:09:26.080 --> 1:09:30.080]  I mean I guess now we're just total prisoners Steve
[1:09:30.080 --> 1:09:34.080]  well very simply Alex here's the way it lays
[1:09:34.080 --> 1:09:38.080]  with the food shortages and with these
[1:09:38.080 --> 1:09:42.080]  good range farmers and ranchers being
[1:09:42.080 --> 1:09:46.080]  threatened when the clean food is gone the only thing people
[1:09:46.080 --> 1:09:50.080]  will have left is the stuff that we're guaranteeing not to ship
[1:09:50.080 --> 1:09:54.080]  them this genetically altered stuff so the first thing that people
[1:09:54.080 --> 1:09:58.080]  must do is they must get their supply of clean food while they still
[1:09:58.080 --> 1:10:02.080]  have it available and the second thing that they have to do is
[1:10:02.080 --> 1:10:06.080]  no matter where they are they got to find some way to raise a gardener
[1:10:06.080 --> 1:10:10.080]  and start gardening as long and as hard as they can now it might not
[1:10:10.080 --> 1:10:14.080]  get down to the individual it might just take out the mid range
[1:10:14.080 --> 1:10:18.080]  of producers but those people are the ones that are producing
[1:10:18.080 --> 1:10:22.080]  the food that you can trust well regardless I mean regardless
[1:10:22.080 --> 1:10:26.080]  they're saying we're going into a depression let's hope that doesn't happen
[1:10:26.080 --> 1:10:30.080]  folks are nuts if they don't buy
[1:10:30.080 --> 1:10:34.080]  storeable food and I go back to this Steve 90% of people as you know
[1:10:34.080 --> 1:10:38.080]  in the great depression were agrarian rural self-sufficient
[1:10:38.080 --> 1:10:42.080]  7 million people starved to death in fact guys google 7 million
[1:10:42.080 --> 1:10:46.080]  starved during great depression I want to bring in a major university study
[1:10:46.080 --> 1:10:50.080]  instead of just plugging in I can't remember exactly which one there were a bunch of them some say 10 million
[1:10:50.080 --> 1:10:54.080]  some say 5 but the big ones at 7 million the point is now 10%
[1:10:54.080 --> 1:10:58.080]  of people are rural instead of 90% and half of them are self-sufficient
[1:10:58.080 --> 1:11:02.080]  Steve give them the number
[1:11:02.080 --> 1:11:06.080]  333 that's 800-409-5633
[1:11:06.080 --> 1:11:10.080]  and the fact is Alex that
[1:11:10.080 --> 1:11:14.080]  it's down to the fact that we can't wait for someone else to do it
[1:11:14.080 --> 1:11:18.080]  the government is not going to do it for us the fact that people
[1:11:18.080 --> 1:11:22.080]  have to take their future into their own hands
[1:11:22.080 --> 1:11:26.080]  and they have to act now when there is no more clean food
[1:11:26.080 --> 1:11:30.080]  the only thing that will be is the drug stuff that is already causing
[1:11:30.080 --> 1:11:34.080]  serious problems within our country in terms of their health
[1:11:34.080 --> 1:11:38.080]  and by the way Steve I spend hours addicted
[1:11:38.080 --> 1:11:42.080]  reading news I'm a total info junkie factoid junkie
[1:11:42.080 --> 1:11:46.080]  I remember you 6-8 months ago saying because of the economic downturn they can't get
[1:11:46.080 --> 1:11:50.080]  credit coming up next spring for the planting
[1:11:50.080 --> 1:11:54.080]  he was saying this last summer I guess more than 6-7 months ago
[1:11:54.080 --> 1:11:58.080]  and farmers are telling me they're not going to put in their crops
[1:11:58.080 --> 1:12:02.080]  because the market is so depressed for them
[1:12:02.080 --> 1:12:06.080]  that is a depression in the real economy while food prices were going up the farmers were getting less
[1:12:06.080 --> 1:12:10.080]  because big agribusiness has gotten a corner on the major warehouses and distribution
[1:12:10.080 --> 1:12:14.080]  just like with beef the beef producers get less money and then
[1:12:14.080 --> 1:12:18.080]  beefs at record prices because it's a bottleneck it's a fraud
[1:12:18.080 --> 1:12:22.080]  the big three meat packers have taken over
[1:12:22.080 --> 1:12:26.080]  the cattleman associations and everything else that's another subject the issue here is
[1:12:26.080 --> 1:12:30.080]  it's just like golds at record demand but then the price drops
[1:12:30.080 --> 1:12:34.080]  it's totally manipulated you were saying that and now it's mainstream news
[1:12:34.080 --> 1:12:38.080]  I saw it just last week in the Associated Press that half the farmers
[1:12:38.080 --> 1:12:42.080]  in the country aren't even putting in crops I couldn't believe that headline
[1:12:42.080 --> 1:12:46.080]  I mean this is insane I mean how do you know this stuff before I do because
[1:12:46.080 --> 1:12:50.080]  I find very few people that have more factoids than I do
[1:12:50.080 --> 1:12:54.080]  I understand but you gotta realize Alex
[1:12:54.080 --> 1:12:58.080]  you're sitting out at the front end of the supply line of food
[1:12:58.080 --> 1:13:02.080]  we see this thing and we've watched the trends
[1:13:02.080 --> 1:13:06.080]  hey I've been at this for a long time the fact is that it's
[1:13:06.080 --> 1:13:10.080]  pretty easy to see the handwriting on the wall when a move is
[1:13:10.080 --> 1:13:14.080]  made that you've seen before only it's more extreme
[1:13:14.080 --> 1:13:18.080]  and just to give you an idea you're absolutely right
[1:13:18.080 --> 1:13:22.080]  half the farmers but then another quarter of the farmers are going
[1:13:22.080 --> 1:13:26.080]  out of business for example down in the southeast
[1:13:26.080 --> 1:13:30.080]  well let's be clear though let's be clear where that statistic
[1:13:30.080 --> 1:13:34.080]  yeah and I mean just to be clear that's of independent farmers
[1:13:34.080 --> 1:13:38.080]  see half of them are going to plant and then like you said the other quarter going out of
[1:13:38.080 --> 1:13:42.080]  business that's what big agribusiness wants they're going to take over
[1:13:42.080 --> 1:13:46.080]  as they've already done Steve 800-409-5633
[1:13:46.080 --> 1:13:50.080]  800-409-5633 ifoodsdirect.com
[1:13:50.080 --> 1:13:54.080]  you'll have operators there to take orders all weekend
[1:13:54.080 --> 1:13:58.080]  800-409-5633 or ifoodsdirect.com
[1:13:58.080 --> 1:14:02.080]  a lot of free videos and info there on the site thank you Steve
[1:14:02.080 --> 1:14:06.080]  okay I normally only have him on for one segment but I really wanted to talk to him about these issues
[1:14:06.080 --> 1:14:10.080]  okay let's go to your calls and we'll have open phones as well with Bob Chapman
[1:14:10.080 --> 1:14:14.080]  Scott and Arizona you're on the air
[1:14:14.080 --> 1:14:18.080]  good
[1:14:18.080 --> 1:14:22.080]  the aerosol campaign about last year near the end of it and told you
[1:14:22.080 --> 1:14:26.080]  about the indirect direct and semi-direct you called in about 8-9 months ago
[1:14:26.080 --> 1:14:30.080]  and said Google direct indirect aerosol campaign
[1:14:30.080 --> 1:14:34.080]  and I got tens of thousands of hits on Google and it was all universities
[1:14:34.080 --> 1:14:38.080]  and governments saying exactly what we'd always said
[1:14:38.080 --> 1:14:42.080]  they're mixing particulates in with jet fuel that are nuclei
[1:14:42.080 --> 1:14:46.080]  and then what the news agency's test is the exact nuclei
[1:14:46.080 --> 1:14:50.080]  to form clouds that's why they'll spray a trail
[1:14:50.080 --> 1:14:54.080]  it's non-ice crystals and it forms and stays there for hours and then
[1:14:54.080 --> 1:14:58.080]  creates this blackout NASA now reports the Earth is 20% darker
[1:14:58.080 --> 1:15:02.080]  and it is now confirmed and yes that was
[1:15:02.080 --> 1:15:06.080]  and that now broke because you called into the show go ahead
[1:15:06.080 --> 1:15:10.080]  now I want to give you some more information now I've studied this pretty extensively like anybody
[1:15:10.080 --> 1:15:14.080]  should when researching it and there's a company that needs to be exposed
[1:15:14.080 --> 1:15:18.080]  this is the leading company that is calling all this they own the aircraft
[1:15:18.080 --> 1:15:22.080]  they they're actually a company that does bow terrorism they're hooked up with homeland security
[1:15:22.080 --> 1:15:26.080]  you can go right to their website they're called the tell they start to start with a B
[1:15:26.080 --> 1:15:30.080]  that's B-A-T-T-E-L-L-E the tell
[1:15:30.080 --> 1:15:34.080]  now there if you and when you Google indirect semi-direct you can put the tell
[1:15:34.080 --> 1:15:38.080]  with that you'll also get that their aircraft you can get their flight pattern
[1:15:38.080 --> 1:15:42.080]  no they've come up in my research yeah but tell very sinister
[1:15:42.080 --> 1:15:46.080]  they are hooked up directly they do they do everything for bioterrorism
[1:15:46.080 --> 1:15:50.080]  but they're hooked up with this so it's kind of funny how they have a part for bioterrorism
[1:15:50.080 --> 1:15:54.080]  with with you know homeland security and everything else
[1:15:54.080 --> 1:15:58.080]  is going to save us from the biotech
[1:15:58.080 --> 1:16:02.080]  exactly but they are terrorizing our atmosphere now they're also hooked up
[1:16:02.080 --> 1:16:06.080]  with Pacific Northwest National Labs this hooked up to labs
[1:16:06.080 --> 1:16:10.080]  it hooks up the Oak Ridge and it hooks up the Pacific Northwest
[1:16:10.080 --> 1:16:14.080]  and the other big key one in your research haven't you keep running into the Stanford
[1:16:14.080 --> 1:16:18.080]  Research Institute yeah they you know they actually have a lot of universities
[1:16:18.080 --> 1:16:22.080]  are tied and I've actually talked to a doctor I called up one of the doctors because if you look up these
[1:16:22.080 --> 1:16:26.080]  things you can get the people who are involved no I've been telling my producer I've got to hire
[1:16:26.080 --> 1:16:30.080]  an extra producer because he's so overwhelmed I got him doing video and camera Rob do
[1:16:30.080 --> 1:16:34.080]  about telling me I've been saying hey call you know
[1:16:34.080 --> 1:16:38.080]  before people tell him not to before they get contacted because I know it's going to start happening
[1:16:38.080 --> 1:16:42.080]  call this director call that director because you can find these guys with all their
[1:16:42.080 --> 1:16:46.080]  patents and papers and how they're spraying the atmosphere and we're going to get these guys
[1:16:46.080 --> 1:16:50.080]  on and just have them admit it like it's no big deal
[1:16:50.080 --> 1:16:54.080]  Battelle is the company Pacific Northwest National Labs they have them there
[1:16:54.080 --> 1:16:58.080]  they work with Battelle they actually Battelle runs these labs okay
[1:16:58.080 --> 1:17:02.080]  for their operations and the thing is when you're when they're spraying the atmosphere
[1:17:02.080 --> 1:17:06.080]  they use certain terms like scattering scattering is a term that they use to dispense
[1:17:06.080 --> 1:17:10.080]  aerosols into the atmosphere so you got to look at their key forms of words that they use
[1:17:10.080 --> 1:17:14.080]  and then they'll define you know of course I mean I get emails going
[1:17:14.080 --> 1:17:18.080]  they haven't admitted chemtrails they're admitting they're just spraying aerosols
[1:17:18.080 --> 1:17:22.080]  yeah our name for it is chemtrails
[1:17:22.080 --> 1:17:26.080]  exactly that's the layman terms for but you see how people though have cognitive
[1:17:26.080 --> 1:17:30.080]  dissidents you know here they are saying we're going to terraform the earth and save you and
[1:17:30.080 --> 1:17:34.080]  spray particulate nuclei to form clouds to protect you and then
[1:17:34.080 --> 1:17:38.080]  we go yeah that's what they've been doing all these years were saying hey they're creating
[1:17:38.080 --> 1:17:42.080]  cloud cover with deadly chemicals and then the government says yes we're
[1:17:42.080 --> 1:17:46.080]  creating cloud cover with deadly chemicals but we call it something different so it's no big deal
[1:17:46.080 --> 1:17:50.080]  exactly now here's the other time you know how it ties in the university
[1:17:50.080 --> 1:17:54.080]  it ties in through the DOE DOE branches off to Battelle and they
[1:17:54.080 --> 1:17:58.080]  use another side branch do that called the arm program which is
[1:17:58.080 --> 1:18:02.080]  atmospheric radiation measurement program that's how it ties into the university
[1:18:02.080 --> 1:18:06.080]  actually Congress funds that program through the university this is how it all
[1:18:06.080 --> 1:18:10.080]  it's a one big operation let me stop you let me stop you
[1:18:10.080 --> 1:18:14.080]  because this is a big announcement I am making the Obama film a second Obama
[1:18:14.080 --> 1:18:18.080]  film right now it's going to be done
[1:18:18.080 --> 1:18:22.080]  and released July 4th okay
[1:18:22.080 --> 1:18:26.080]  because there's you know stuff's moving fast people like you
[1:18:26.080 --> 1:18:30.080]  because I've been doing research too so I know you're what you're saying is accurate you need to get a
[1:18:30.080 --> 1:18:34.080]  decent camera set it up mic yourself or you know be close to
[1:18:34.080 --> 1:18:38.080]  a shotgun mic or whatever you need to just make sure it's decent

[1:24:24.080 --> 1:24:28.080]  make no mistake ladies and gentlemen and the media
[1:24:28.080 --> 1:24:32.080]  is even having to admit that now I keep telling the police
[1:24:32.080 --> 1:24:36.080]  and military the first people they're going to come after in a hot police state
[1:24:36.080 --> 1:24:40.080]  in a real tyranny in the
[1:24:40.080 --> 1:24:44.080]  type of purge system they're planning is going to be you
[1:24:44.080 --> 1:24:48.080]  and they're setting up a police state
[1:24:48.080 --> 1:24:52.080]  because our standard of living is going to implode Bob Chapman was in military
[1:24:52.080 --> 1:24:56.080]  intelligence that he was the most successful silver and gold brokers
[1:24:56.080 --> 1:25:00.080]  in the world had the largest financial newsletter for a time
[1:25:00.080 --> 1:25:04.080]  retired came back and Bob also
[1:25:04.080 --> 1:25:08.080]  helped publish none dare call conspiracy with Gary Allen he's been fighting the
[1:25:08.080 --> 1:25:12.080]  new order for 45 plus years Bob quick segment I want to come back and just take a lot of
[1:25:12.080 --> 1:25:16.080]  calls today with you so folks have a chance to talk to you Eddie and Tito
[1:25:16.080 --> 1:25:20.080]  and Paul and Phillip others that are holding but first off
[1:25:20.080 --> 1:25:24.080]  you know we knew they were putting out the reports we've been putting this out for decades
[1:25:24.080 --> 1:25:28.080]  that Christians gun owners are terrorists but now they're saying the number one
[1:25:28.080 --> 1:25:32.080]  threat and I guess we are a threat because this government's so criminal
[1:25:32.080 --> 1:25:36.080]  and wants to do kind of a Soviet style purge
[1:25:36.080 --> 1:25:40.080]  to reeducate the American people and I guess we are a threat when folks find out
[1:25:40.080 --> 1:25:44.080]  the bankers have totally destroyed our future and the public tries to bring the bankers to justice
[1:25:44.080 --> 1:25:48.080]  I guess we are a threat to the made-offs that run things
[1:25:48.080 --> 1:25:52.080]  well that's for sure and that's because we're reaching
[1:25:52.080 --> 1:25:56.080]  millions of people all over the world every week and they
[1:25:56.080 --> 1:26:00.080]  don't want that they want to keep the people ignorant
[1:26:00.080 --> 1:26:04.080]  of who's done what to them and what they're planning for them
[1:26:04.080 --> 1:26:08.080]  and we're being very very effective that's why
[1:26:08.080 --> 1:26:12.080]  in weeks past you and I on this program and you with others have
[1:26:12.080 --> 1:26:16.080]  discussed the major media
[1:26:16.080 --> 1:26:20.080]  trying to pick up and use or
[1:26:20.080 --> 1:26:24.080]  infiltrate what we're doing and we discussed that
[1:26:24.080 --> 1:26:28.080]  in the things that Mr. Beck had been talking
[1:26:28.080 --> 1:26:32.080]  about on his shows and others and
[1:26:32.080 --> 1:26:36.080]  they're terrified because they don't want the
[1:26:36.080 --> 1:26:40.080]  people to know and the people
[1:26:40.080 --> 1:26:44.080]  who are overseas in the military they know something's wrong
[1:26:44.080 --> 1:26:48.080]  and a lot of them are very unhappy
[1:26:48.080 --> 1:26:52.080]  they saw their friends and you're in the military
[1:26:52.080 --> 1:26:56.080]  the guy that's with you whether you like him or not he's your friend
[1:26:56.080 --> 1:27:00.080]  because your life may depend on it and his as well
[1:27:00.080 --> 1:27:04.080]  and they've seen a lot of their friends get killed
[1:27:04.080 --> 1:27:08.080]  and then they hear the kind of things that we're saying and they say
[1:27:08.080 --> 1:27:12.080]  what am I doing here why did I do this
[1:27:12.080 --> 1:27:16.080]  all I'm doing is working for Wall Street and a bunch of politicians
[1:27:16.080 --> 1:27:20.080]  and they're bad people and so that's why they consider
[1:27:20.080 --> 1:27:24.080]  overall generally speaking veterans
[1:27:24.080 --> 1:27:28.080]  to be part of the enemy and
[1:27:28.080 --> 1:27:32.080]  they made them that way they made you and I
[1:27:32.080 --> 1:27:36.080]  that way by being evil and using the people
[1:27:36.080 --> 1:27:40.080]  and doing things to the people that they should have never done
[1:27:40.080 --> 1:27:44.080]  and as I've said on the program before
[1:27:44.080 --> 1:27:48.080]  they are not going to win we may pay a great
[1:27:48.080 --> 1:27:52.080]  price but we will win but they're going to lose
[1:27:52.080 --> 1:27:56.080]  and they're never going to be able to do it again for a long time
[1:27:56.080 --> 1:28:00.080]  well tyrants generally fall nations almost always fall to terrain
[1:28:00.080 --> 1:28:04.080]  but the tyrants always fall the question is how bad is it before
[1:28:04.080 --> 1:28:08.080]  things fall because tyrants just can't help abusing people
[1:28:08.080 --> 1:28:12.080]  and creating and stealing and the criminals they hire
[1:28:12.080 --> 1:28:16.080]  it's like a bacterial infection they just breed and breed and breed until nothing's left
[1:28:16.080 --> 1:28:20.080]  and everything collapses or the people rebel and overthrow them
[1:28:20.080 --> 1:28:24.080]  and the globalists call this a scientific dictatorship but they're not carrying it out
[1:28:24.080 --> 1:28:28.080]  completely in a scientific way they enjoy their work too much
[1:28:28.080 --> 1:28:32.080]  and are getting a little bit out of control and pushing in a little too fast
[1:28:32.080 --> 1:28:36.080]  and if we would just wake people up, arrest the bankers, arrest the new world order
[1:28:36.080 --> 1:28:40.080]  arrest crimes, in the drug war, in the prohibition
[1:28:40.080 --> 1:28:44.080]  on the second amendment all of this would end overnight but instead
[1:28:44.080 --> 1:28:48.080]  they're going to hold the course and it's just going to come to a head
[1:28:48.080 --> 1:28:52.080]  and I just hope the police and military realize those of you
[1:28:52.080 --> 1:28:56.080]  that still don't understand what's happening you're being marched towards your own destruction
[1:28:56.080 --> 1:29:00.080]  and the globalists plan to have a purge of the police and military
[1:29:00.080 --> 1:29:04.080]  in the controlled crises
[1:29:04.080 --> 1:29:08.080]  they plan to set up between the American people and them
[1:29:08.080 --> 1:29:12.080]  and how about we just bypass all that and arrest the bankers, isn't that a better plan Bob?
[1:29:12.080 --> 1:29:16.080]  It certainly is and I don't know how we're going to go about that
[1:29:16.080 --> 1:29:20.080]  it's going to be pretty difficult because they own Congress
[1:29:20.080 --> 1:29:24.080]  they bought them all off and they would have to be
[1:29:24.080 --> 1:29:28.080]  some sort of resurrection in Congress and from out of the blue
[1:29:28.080 --> 1:29:32.080]  and they would have to say, gee
[1:29:32.080 --> 1:29:36.080]  Alex and people like him are correct, we've got to do something about this
[1:29:36.080 --> 1:29:40.080]  because maybe they'll come after us and we really didn't do anything except take
[1:29:40.080 --> 1:29:44.080]  money and so
[1:29:44.080 --> 1:29:48.080]  that could happen Bob, stay there
[1:29:48.080 --> 1:29:52.080]  it could happen if we push it
[1:29:52.080 --> 1:29:56.080]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run
[1:29:56.080 --> 1:30:00.080]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network

[1:31:04.080 --> 1:31:08.080]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear
[1:31:08.080 --> 1:31:12.080]  we've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful

[1:34:28.080 --> 1:34:32.080]  look, if you take anything away from this, then we're going to go to your calls
[1:34:32.080 --> 1:34:36.080]  anything away from what I and Bob Chapman are discussing here
[1:34:36.080 --> 1:34:40.080]  understand this, the world is a brutal
[1:34:40.080 --> 1:34:44.080]  cold dangerous place in history and good men and women have gotten
[1:34:44.080 --> 1:34:48.080]  together and created systems to protect their liberty in the past
[1:34:48.080 --> 1:34:52.080]  and even when you're desperately guarding it and fighting for it, it's very hard to keep
[1:34:52.080 --> 1:34:56.080]  now when you run around drunk on power
[1:34:56.080 --> 1:35:00.080]  having fun, not caring what's going on, giggling and laughing, when people warn
[1:35:00.080 --> 1:35:04.080]  you about tyranny, you are going to get hurt real bad every single
[1:35:04.080 --> 1:35:08.080]  time, okay
[1:35:08.080 --> 1:35:12.080]  and I told everybody for years, I said all this al-Qaeda and all this anti-terror
[1:35:12.080 --> 1:35:16.080]  you know they are, the feds already tried to bomb
[1:35:16.080 --> 1:35:20.080]  Oklahoma City and get a police state going in the name of you know going after terrorist
[1:35:20.080 --> 1:35:24.080]  within in America and I said that didn't work too well for them
[1:35:24.080 --> 1:35:28.080]  so I said they're going to stage terror attacks and blame it on foreigners and I said that in
[1:35:28.080 --> 1:35:32.080]  99, 2000, 2001 because I could read the public white papers put out by government
[1:35:32.080 --> 1:35:36.080]  and others where they were saying we sure need a terror attack if we had
[1:35:36.080 --> 1:35:40.080]  foreigners attacking us or what looked like we're foreigners, then we could with a big pearl harbour
[1:35:40.080 --> 1:35:44.080]  event launch this global war against a shadowy enemy because you can't ever beat
[1:35:44.080 --> 1:35:48.080]  terrorism, I mean they basically came out and said they were going to do it
[1:35:48.080 --> 1:35:52.080]  they were 99% there in PNAC documents, grand chess board
[1:35:52.080 --> 1:35:56.080]  and I was like folks there's an army document says this, look at that
[1:35:56.080 --> 1:36:00.080]  get ready they're going to attack us, well Alex what do you think they'll blow up, how the
[1:36:00.080 --> 1:36:04.080]  World Trade Center, they already bombed at once and that even came out
[1:36:04.080 --> 1:36:08.080]  and I'm telling you these are ruthless people, they are cunning
[1:36:08.080 --> 1:36:12.080]  and they're going for broke now, they have
[1:36:12.080 --> 1:36:16.080]  committed crimes so huge, we're devastated, it's a depression
[1:36:16.080 --> 1:36:20.080]  it's done, the question is will we now let them sit on top
[1:36:20.080 --> 1:36:24.080]  of us during the depression and make it worse or will we bring them to justice and turn things
[1:36:24.080 --> 1:36:28.080]  around, okay
[1:36:28.080 --> 1:36:32.080]  and they know if we turn it around the only way
[1:36:32.080 --> 1:36:36.080]  we turn it around is them going to prison, they're not going to turn loose, well they're
[1:36:36.080 --> 1:36:40.080]  walking around free folks, they'll stage terror attacks, they'll release bird flu, they'll start
[1:36:40.080 --> 1:36:44.080]  World War 3, they'll set off nukes, they're bold folks, that's why they're in control
[1:36:44.080 --> 1:36:48.080]  they're bold and they're ruthless and they're evil and they're sadistic and they enjoy their
[1:36:48.080 --> 1:36:52.080]  work, they don't just do it cold bloodedly, they enjoy it
[1:36:52.080 --> 1:36:56.080]  now I'm going to tell you something, military police, good old boys, liberals, everybody else
[1:36:56.080 --> 1:37:00.080]  grow up, face reality, face what we're up against
[1:37:00.080 --> 1:37:04.080]  or it's over, I'm not risking my life for nothing, I know Bob Chapman
[1:37:04.080 --> 1:37:08.080]  had been, he's had to leave the country the stuff they were doing to him to keep the fight going
[1:37:08.080 --> 1:37:12.080]  now this is real ladies and gentlemen, you know how real it is when they persecute you
[1:37:12.080 --> 1:37:16.080]  now going back to Bob Chapman, Bob I mean I'm trying to throw the gauntlet
[1:37:16.080 --> 1:37:20.080]  down to people so they understand but the globalist already threw the gauntlet down
[1:37:20.080 --> 1:37:24.080]  we don't have a choice in this, be slaves or fight back and the most frustrating
[1:37:24.080 --> 1:37:28.080]  thing is I see people fighting back and having an effect and I know that people
[1:37:28.080 --> 1:37:32.080]  really took action, we would kick the butt of the New World Order, Bob Chapman
[1:37:32.080 --> 1:37:36.080]  you're absolutely right and that's why when I
[1:37:36.080 --> 1:37:40.080]  have the opportunity to go on programs even how
[1:37:40.080 --> 1:37:44.080]  remote they are, I take it, I was on with a group of Republicans
[1:37:44.080 --> 1:37:48.080]  in Palm Beach County in Florida
[1:37:48.080 --> 1:37:52.080]  this week and I was amazed that the
[1:37:52.080 --> 1:37:56.080]  Collins that came in on the program were asking the kind of people
[1:37:56.080 --> 1:38:00.080]  questions that your audience does so there's a lot of people out there
[1:38:00.080 --> 1:38:04.080]  who are helping us, who are working for the same end
[1:38:04.080 --> 1:38:08.080]  and that is to expose the people who have created all these problems
[1:38:08.080 --> 1:38:12.080]  for America and for the world and if we can just get that message
[1:38:12.080 --> 1:38:16.080]  out like you are Alex with the
[1:38:16.080 --> 1:38:20.080]  DVDs and your programs and everything else
[1:38:20.080 --> 1:38:24.080]  we can stop them, you never know there's always some
[1:38:24.080 --> 1:38:28.080]  untoward event that happens that nobody
[1:38:28.080 --> 1:38:32.080]  expects and it could be a bank going under
[1:38:32.080 --> 1:38:36.080]  it could be a revolution in some country, it could be
[1:38:36.080 --> 1:38:40.080]  an assassination in some country that wasn't planned by
[1:38:40.080 --> 1:38:44.080]  the alumnus, you just know the know, there can be that event
[1:38:44.080 --> 1:38:48.080]  and when that event happens people all of a sudden
[1:38:48.080 --> 1:38:52.080]  it comes together for them and they say
[1:38:52.080 --> 1:38:56.080]  well as you said Alex let's bring them to try these people atreasonous
[1:38:56.080 --> 1:39:00.080]  well Bob
[1:39:00.080 --> 1:39:04.080]  you're absolutely right and folks I don't just get up here like a cheerleader telling
[1:39:04.080 --> 1:39:08.080]  you we have a chance to beat these people
[1:39:08.080 --> 1:39:12.080]  the biggest thing we have going against this is the phony Christian churches and again I'm a Christian
[1:39:12.080 --> 1:39:16.080]  the phony Christian churches, Catholic Protestant, you name it, bought off by the world council of churches
[1:39:16.080 --> 1:39:20.080]  openly on FEMA payroll, we told you when it was classified
[1:39:20.080 --> 1:39:24.080]  now it's mainstream news, I start thinking about the amazing amount of stuff we break here
[1:39:24.080 --> 1:39:28.080]  it's just incredible thanks to the listeners that feed us all this info that we then double check
[1:39:28.080 --> 1:39:32.080]  triple check and their churches
[1:39:32.080 --> 1:39:36.080]  are saying lay down, this is good, the government loves you, it's of the Lord, do what they say
[1:39:36.080 --> 1:39:40.080]  as soon as that is torn aside and we're getting very close to that
[1:39:40.080 --> 1:39:44.080]  then we can move forward but they've told Christians it's the end of the world
[1:39:44.080 --> 1:39:48.080]  so don't fight evil, lay down and take it, folks even if it
[1:39:48.080 --> 1:39:52.080]  is the end of the world which I don't believe it is, you've got a duty to fight evil
[1:39:52.080 --> 1:39:56.080]  don't you Bob? Absolutely, absolutely
[1:39:56.080 --> 1:40:00.080]  right to the very end and a lot of us
[1:40:00.080 --> 1:40:04.080]  can't do it and that's okay, we're not all built that way
[1:40:04.080 --> 1:40:08.080]  but there are a lot of people out there who are bright
[1:40:08.080 --> 1:40:12.080]  and intellectually and physically powerful
[1:40:12.080 --> 1:40:16.080]  they're healthy people and they should be joining us in this
[1:40:16.080 --> 1:40:20.080]  thing, you know I've been at this for almost 50 years
[1:40:20.080 --> 1:40:24.080]  and quite frankly I never get tired because I don't want to get beat
[1:40:24.080 --> 1:40:28.080]  I want to beat them and that's why I keep on doing what I do
[1:40:28.080 --> 1:40:32.080]  Exactly, you've got to turn the survival instinct
[1:40:32.080 --> 1:40:36.080]  the competitive instinct loose against these people
[1:40:36.080 --> 1:40:40.080]  and know that's all around you, millions of people worldwide, millions of the United States
[1:40:40.080 --> 1:40:44.080]  we are all working towards the same thing bringing
[1:40:44.080 --> 1:40:48.080]  justice to justice and we're going to defeat these people
[1:40:48.080 --> 1:40:52.080]  in the end, I want to go to Eddie and all these other callers
[1:40:52.080 --> 1:40:56.080]  but Bob I've got to get this question out to you as well
[1:40:56.080 --> 1:41:00.080]  Obama comes out and says I'm going to protect the torturers, we're not going to call it
[1:41:00.080 --> 1:41:04.080]  torture anymore, we're going to call it tough interrogation, the camps are going to stay open
[1:41:04.080 --> 1:41:08.080]  if you really read what he actually, what the memos and executive orders say, it's going to continue
[1:41:08.080 --> 1:41:12.080]  here's the headline here out of the news
[1:41:12.080 --> 1:41:16.080]  you know, the most skilled CA officers over use of torture
[1:41:16.080 --> 1:41:20.080]  is chaining someone up to a wall where they can't move
[1:41:20.080 --> 1:41:24.080]  or where they are forced to stand for 7 and a half days
[1:41:24.080 --> 1:41:28.080]  I mean from what I've read about torture throughout the last few thousand years
[1:41:28.080 --> 1:41:32.080]  in Korea and Russia and in Vietnam
[1:41:32.080 --> 1:41:36.080]  isn't that one of the worst forms of torture is tying somebody up to a wall
[1:41:36.080 --> 1:41:40.080]  Absolutely
[1:41:40.080 --> 1:41:44.080]  they also use water torture while they're at it
[1:41:44.080 --> 1:41:48.080]  and you know, not immersion but the dripping on the head
[1:41:48.080 --> 1:41:52.080]  and the dripping in the cell and then the lights are on all the time
[1:41:52.080 --> 1:41:56.080]  and they're playing loud music
[1:41:56.080 --> 1:41:58.080]  and they get all sorts of tricks that they use
[1:41:58.080 --> 1:42:02.080]  and by the way, the North Vietnamese turned our airmen in a year or two
[1:42:02.080 --> 1:42:06.080]  most of them into gibbering zombies with that
[1:42:06.080 --> 1:42:08.080]  go ahead
[1:42:08.080 --> 1:42:12.080]  and you know when I was a young person during
[1:42:12.080 --> 1:42:16.080]  the second great war that you know
[1:42:16.080 --> 1:42:20.080]  you would hear about a torture that the Japanese
[1:42:20.080 --> 1:42:24.080]  and the Germans used well compared to what they're using today
[1:42:24.080 --> 1:42:28.080]  that was child's play because they didn't know how to
[1:42:28.080 --> 1:42:32.080]  attack the mind at that time that didn't evolve until
[1:42:32.080 --> 1:42:36.080]  the late 40s and the early 50s and of course
[1:42:36.080 --> 1:42:40.080]  we had Korea and then that
[1:42:40.080 --> 1:42:44.080]  is when quote brainwashing began
[1:42:44.080 --> 1:42:48.080]  but you know it's been an evolutionary process
[1:42:48.080 --> 1:42:52.080]  but now they got it down to a science and there's very few people who can stand
[1:42:52.080 --> 1:42:56.080]  not being broken
[1:42:56.080 --> 1:43:00.080]  Well I would just go insane I know that
[1:43:00.080 --> 1:43:04.080]  I just can you imagine
[1:43:04.080 --> 1:43:08.080]  well the even sicker part is they then try to say oh we've been torturing them for seven years
[1:43:08.080 --> 1:43:12.080]  now they confess to 9-11 and then they marched them in a few months
[1:43:12.080 --> 1:43:16.080]  ago and they began screaming I was tortured it's fake I was promised to be let go
[1:43:16.080 --> 1:43:20.080]  and then they go oh shut down the trial and that was in the news
[1:43:20.080 --> 1:43:24.080]  in you know the news wires but never on the nightly news that they march them up and go
[1:43:24.080 --> 1:43:28.080]  you now plead guilty and they finally thought they could take them to one of these kangaroo courts
[1:43:28.080 --> 1:43:32.080]  and they start screaming I was tortured it's all fake they still hadn't broken them
[1:43:32.080 --> 1:43:36.080]  and torture they're under now
[1:43:36.080 --> 1:43:40.080]  Oh it must be unbelievable and you know the point I was really trying to make
[1:43:40.080 --> 1:43:44.080]  about World War II is that America never did such things
[1:43:44.080 --> 1:43:48.080]  and the whole
[1:43:48.080 --> 1:43:52.080]  psyche the whole moral apparatus of the United States
[1:43:52.080 --> 1:43:56.080]  has because of our leadership changed dramatically
[1:43:56.080 --> 1:44:00.080]  and you know there are a lot of people
[1:44:00.080 --> 1:44:04.080]  who work in counterintelligence with the government
[1:44:04.080 --> 1:44:08.080]  and most of them are in the 60s 70s and 80s
[1:44:08.080 --> 1:44:12.080]  and they've all said the same thing to me we never did anything like that
[1:44:12.080 --> 1:44:16.080]  we wouldn't even think of doing something like that
[1:44:16.080 --> 1:44:20.080]  well plus it doesn't work they admit and all the experts admit this is historical fact
[1:44:20.080 --> 1:44:24.080]  torture is only good for terror torture is only good for fake
[1:44:24.080 --> 1:44:28.080]  confessions it's not good for real intelligence what you do is you walk in
[1:44:28.080 --> 1:44:32.080]  and you say we got evidence you committed these crimes you're going to prison for the rest of your life
[1:44:32.080 --> 1:44:36.080]  or we're going to put you up before a trial and you're going to get the death penalty
[1:44:36.080 --> 1:44:40.080]  now you got five minutes to talk and it's got to be on record
[1:44:40.080 --> 1:44:44.080]  that you do what you say you're going to do you got five minutes to sing
[1:44:44.080 --> 1:44:48.080]  like a canary and if we find out it's fake that's it
[1:44:48.080 --> 1:44:52.080]  you're going to be executed then they talk but see these
[1:44:52.080 --> 1:44:56.080]  aren't real terrorists the terrorism was committed by the very people doing the torture
[1:44:56.080 --> 1:45:00.080]  so all they want is fake confessions so of course torture is good for them
[1:45:00.080 --> 1:45:04.080]  they're absolute fiends
[1:45:04.080 --> 1:45:08.080]  but anyway absolutely but you know
[1:45:08.080 --> 1:45:12.080]  the people that really know how to interrogate that's what you do
[1:45:12.080 --> 1:45:16.080]  and you come in give them cigarettes coffee whatever and just say look
[1:45:16.080 --> 1:45:20.080]  you're going to go to prison if you don't you know tell the truth
[1:45:20.080 --> 1:45:24.080]  and then 99% of the time they talk you start torturing people folks
[1:45:24.080 --> 1:45:28.080]  they get totally discredited and now how are we going to criticize
[1:45:28.080 --> 1:45:32.080]  the Somalis when they capture our sailors and torture
[1:45:32.080 --> 1:45:36.080]  Bob there's no room for that
[1:45:36.080 --> 1:45:40.080]  they you know they're just doing what we're doing
[1:45:40.080 --> 1:45:44.080]  this total justification in their minds for what they're doing
[1:45:44.080 --> 1:45:48.080]  and you know our people our citizens
[1:45:48.080 --> 1:45:52.080]  and our military people can expect that they're going to get
[1:45:52.080 --> 1:45:56.080]  possible treatment if captured because of what our government has done
[1:45:56.080 --> 1:46:00.080]  to people
[1:46:00.080 --> 1:46:04.080]  it's just amazing Bob let's go to some calls they've been holding long enough
[1:46:04.080 --> 1:46:08.080]  and can you stay a little bit in the next hour with us
[1:46:08.080 --> 1:46:12.080]  awesome I know you're a busy man okay Eddie in California thanks for holding
[1:46:12.080 --> 1:46:16.080]  go ahead
[1:46:16.080 --> 1:46:20.080]  hey thanks for taking my call Alex
[1:46:20.080 --> 1:46:24.080]  well I did you on YouTube
[1:46:24.080 --> 1:46:28.080]  and I read in YouTube comments a lot and all these people
[1:46:28.080 --> 1:46:32.080]  they like to leave comments like well Alex Jones is only in his pocket
[1:46:32.080 --> 1:46:36.080]  Alex is just out for the money and it's kind of funny to me because
[1:46:36.080 --> 1:46:40.080]  I've been up with you for probably the past two years
[1:46:40.080 --> 1:46:44.080]  and I've never paid a single red cent
[1:46:44.080 --> 1:46:48.080]  to get any of this news
[1:46:48.080 --> 1:46:52.080]  and you get Bob's take on it
[1:46:52.080 --> 1:46:56.080]  I'm not saying it's all going to tell the government most of it's just mental illness and
[1:46:56.080 --> 1:47:00.080]  they have a term for it in Mexico and I forget it I've been told it in Spanish
[1:47:00.080 --> 1:47:04.080]  but it means whatever poppy sticks its head up or whatever chicken sticks their head up
[1:47:04.080 --> 1:47:08.080]  the smaller chickens want to knock it back down
[1:47:08.080 --> 1:47:12.080]  or you see crabs in a bucket when you've been catching crabs at the beach
[1:47:12.080 --> 1:47:16.080]  if they work together they could climb out but instead one of them tries to climb out
[1:47:16.080 --> 1:47:20.080]  and
[1:47:20.080 --> 1:47:24.080]  I actually wish I didn't have to spend my time trying to raise money through sponsors
[1:47:24.080 --> 1:47:28.080]  and sales of videos to run the operation because then I could make
[1:47:28.080 --> 1:47:32.080]  more films and get more information out but we live in the real world
[1:47:32.080 --> 1:47:36.080]  so I love these people that say oh you should have your radio show for free and your films for free
[1:47:36.080 --> 1:47:40.080]  well I mean I guess I could live with my parents
[1:47:40.080 --> 1:47:44.080]  and then maybe somebody could pay for the microphone
[1:47:44.080 --> 1:47:48.080]  I mean this is mental illness but if you read the COINTELPRO documents
[1:47:48.080 --> 1:47:52.080]  they say when they were trying to neutralize groups in the 60s and 70s
[1:47:52.080 --> 1:47:56.080]  talk about how they're in it for money talk about it well of course I've got to want money
[1:47:56.080 --> 1:48:00.080]  and I'm not going to lie I like once every two weeks to go eat a decent steak or something
[1:48:00.080 --> 1:48:04.080]  of course I'm going to diet now I'm not doing that I like to I mean I'm wearing a shirt right now
[1:48:04.080 --> 1:48:08.080]  it's got holes in the back of it because I'm attached to the shirt I'm wearing a black shirt I've had since high school
[1:48:08.080 --> 1:48:12.080]  but I mean I'm not into things my dad gave me a watch
[1:48:12.080 --> 1:48:16.080]  so I like it but you know I mean I like
[1:48:16.080 --> 1:48:20.080]  old cannonballs and stuff that you know are passed down from my great-great-grandpa
[1:48:20.080 --> 1:48:24.080]  or whatever I mean I'm into paintings my great-grandma painted
[1:48:24.080 --> 1:48:28.080]  but I wouldn't sell out for money see money itself isn't a bad thing like
[1:48:28.080 --> 1:48:32.080]  gun isn't a bad thing and that's all they can do they can't
[1:48:32.080 --> 1:48:36.080]  talk about our info so I give my films out for free I post
[1:48:36.080 --> 1:48:40.080]  where they're at for free and that and so that upsets them so much
[1:48:40.080 --> 1:48:44.080]  they've got to say no there's nobody pure of art there's nobody who's
[1:48:44.080 --> 1:48:48.080]  good and and but I mean Bob it's mental illness isn't it
[1:48:48.080 --> 1:48:52.080]  absolutely and the term that I use when you're
[1:48:52.080 --> 1:48:56.080]  in first place everybody else wants to kick you out
[1:48:56.080 --> 1:49:00.080]  it's as simple as that it's a form of jealousy
[1:49:00.080 --> 1:49:04.080]  and I've gone through it all my life and it's been the most disappointing thing to me because
[1:49:04.080 --> 1:49:08.080]  many long-term friends eventually get jealous because
[1:49:08.080 --> 1:49:12.080]  you know I don't have an ego I don't make any issue out of the fact I do
[1:49:12.080 --> 1:49:16.080]  what I do and and people get even more upset but see I don't
[1:49:16.080 --> 1:49:20.080]  get jealous of money from anybody with the exception of the subscriber
[1:49:20.080 --> 1:49:24.080]  and that's it but good good it's not it's not like
[1:49:24.080 --> 1:49:28.080]  a guns you the government makes you give them your money to then use it against
[1:49:28.080 --> 1:49:32.080]  you Bob Chapman has a newsletter I make films
[1:49:32.080 --> 1:49:36.080]  some of those money some of make money and it's a
[1:49:36.080 --> 1:49:40.080]  mind trick it's a mind game that people play
[1:49:40.080 --> 1:49:44.080]  and it is jealousy though
[1:49:44.080 --> 1:49:48.080]  I mean I want to be around successful people dynamic people I like successful
[1:49:48.080 --> 1:49:52.080]  cool smart people I admire them and I thought everybody else
[1:49:52.080 --> 1:49:56.080]  was like me Bob but I guess most winners do admire other winners
[1:49:56.080 --> 1:50:00.080]  losers can't stand it I mean I mean you ought to see the stuff they make up about
[1:50:00.080 --> 1:50:04.080]  me Bob it's just insane
[1:50:04.080 --> 1:50:08.080]  well I can I can believe that because of the exposure you have
[1:50:08.080 --> 1:50:12.080]  but it's just something we have to live with it's human nature
[1:50:12.080 --> 1:50:16.080]  and and we just have to you know brush it aside
[1:50:16.080 --> 1:50:20.080]  and say no that's not the way it is and this is why I do what I do
[1:50:20.080 --> 1:50:24.080]  and if you like that that's terrific and if you don't
[1:50:24.080 --> 1:50:28.080]  well go listen to Hannity or somebody
[1:50:28.080 --> 1:50:32.080]  absolutely why don't you really attack Hannity or hate him a lot because he never said he was a patriot
[1:50:32.080 --> 1:50:36.080]  I don't like Beck because he poses and is so lecherous
[1:50:36.080 --> 1:50:40.080]  anything else Eddie ok we're going to come back and go to Tito
[1:50:40.080 --> 1:50:44.080]  Paul, Philip, Dino and others yeah I mean

[1:55:38.080 --> 1:55:42.080]  from the flipping channels crew in Vancouver BC
[1:55:42.080 --> 1:55:46.080]  just calling to say it's funny that you you're already talking about this but I
[1:55:46.080 --> 1:55:50.080]  re-subscribed renewed my subscription to prismplanet.tv
[1:55:50.080 --> 1:55:54.080]  last week and I've been a subscriber for the last couple years
[1:55:54.080 --> 1:55:58.080]  I let it slide I renewed and truth be told
[1:55:58.080 --> 1:56:02.080]  I never really watched it that much the daily
[1:56:02.080 --> 1:56:06.080]  video broadcast you do I was more of a member for watching your older
[1:56:06.080 --> 1:56:10.080]  documentaries and some of the other ones from other creators
[1:56:10.080 --> 1:56:14.080]  now I've gotten into watching you when you do the live video feed
[1:56:14.080 --> 1:56:18.080]  and I gotta tell you and all your listeners out there
[1:56:18.080 --> 1:56:22.080]  become a member of prismplanet.tv because it's so great to watch when you have
[1:56:22.080 --> 1:56:26.080]  a video clip and I'm used to listening to it on your free podcast where I hear the audio
[1:56:26.080 --> 1:56:30.080]  but it's great now because you show the video you have documents you show the documents
[1:56:30.080 --> 1:56:34.080]  you know and I just wanted to say thanks you know I know you when you made a lot of those first
[1:56:34.080 --> 1:56:38.080]  movies they may have been on VHS you know now they're digital and it's just
[1:56:38.080 --> 1:56:42.080]  I don't know if you ever envisioned yourself being in a position back when you were creating those but I just
[1:56:42.080 --> 1:56:46.080]  want to say thank you because it's a great show and it rivals
[1:56:46.080 --> 1:56:50.080]  the best TV that's out there right now. Oh well I appreciate that we're trying
[1:56:50.080 --> 1:56:54.080]  we're gonna add a lot more building a bigger TV still to actually do a show for the members
[1:56:54.080 --> 1:56:58.080]  and we're also gonna put on TV but you know we were very small
[1:56:58.080 --> 1:57:02.080]  and that first growth phase takes the longest and then our next growth phase
[1:57:02.080 --> 1:57:06.080]  is gonna be even quicker if we're able to do it so I appreciate your support and God bless you.
[1:57:06.080 --> 1:57:10.080]  Yeah we've redesigned prismplanet.tv. We're gonna go back to Paul, Phillip
[1:57:10.080 --> 1:57:14.080]  and Dino in a minute but let's start getting into the economy now in the next segment and we'll go back to calls
[1:57:14.080 --> 1:57:18.080]  in the segment after that in about 10 minutes. Bob Chapman
[1:57:18.080 --> 1:57:22.080]  I mean we've got the IMF and World Bank now saying we're in a depression
[1:57:22.080 --> 1:57:26.080]  are I mean are they trying to destroy confidence?
[1:57:26.080 --> 1:57:30.080]  Well I think they want to be looked upon
[1:57:30.080 --> 1:57:34.080]  in some circumstances as a group that makes good decisions
[1:57:34.080 --> 1:57:38.080]  they've got really a pretty lousy record
[1:57:38.080 --> 1:57:42.080]  over the last 50 or so years or actually more than that
[1:57:42.080 --> 1:57:46.080]  two years and I think they're trying to build
[1:57:46.080 --> 1:57:50.080]  an aura among themselves that they're gonna be right about
[1:57:50.080 --> 1:57:54.080]  things and so that's why I think what they're doing
[1:57:54.080 --> 1:57:58.080]  and you know on the other hand you know you've got the stock market
[1:57:58.080 --> 1:58:02.080]  it's rallied about 30% off its bottom and
[1:58:02.080 --> 1:58:06.080]  Wall Street and CNBC are jumping up and down and this is the beginning of the beginning of the beginning
[1:58:06.080 --> 1:58:10.080]  and it's gonna be all roses now and so on and so forth and of course
[1:58:10.080 --> 1:58:14.080]  they're lying again. There's terrible problems out there
[1:58:14.080 --> 1:58:18.080]  they're not going away and this is
[1:58:18.080 --> 1:58:22.080]  a quote man made rally and the man is
[1:58:22.080 --> 1:58:26.080]  the United States government. And by the way I remember
[1:58:26.080 --> 1:58:30.080]  six, seven months ago you predicted down to the month
[1:58:30.080 --> 1:58:34.080]  and it's on record people are gonna listen to the audio that it would go down
[1:58:34.080 --> 1:58:38.080]  and then you said another big bounce maybe even two more big bounces and then the total plunge
[1:58:38.080 --> 1:58:42.080]  stay there we're gonna come right back in 70 seconds
[1:58:42.080 --> 1:58:46.080]  Thank you for listening to GCN

[2:00:16.080 --> 2:00:20.080]  GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin Texas
[2:00:20.080 --> 2:00:24.080]  Alex Jones
[2:00:24.080 --> 2:00:28.080]  Alright Bob Chapman economic advisor and
[2:00:28.080 --> 2:00:32.080]  expert I remember I know it's in your newsletter
[2:00:32.080 --> 2:00:36.080]  I don't know 4, 5, 6 months ago you can place the day you kept saying
[2:00:36.080 --> 2:00:40.080]  week after week on the show
[2:00:40.080 --> 2:00:44.080]  back when it was 10,000 you said it's going to go down to below 7,000
[2:00:44.080 --> 2:00:48.080]  right at and then you said I think it'll go back up to 10 or so
[2:00:48.080 --> 2:00:52.080]  to sucker people back in and then it'll plunge again and then it'll run back
[2:00:52.080 --> 2:00:56.080]  up but you said a couple more run ups and downs it's you know every time it's
[2:00:56.080 --> 2:01:00.080]  going to go more down and then not up as high as it was previously
[2:01:00.080 --> 2:01:04.080]  because all the market fundamentals can you break down how you knew that was
[2:01:04.080 --> 2:01:08.080]  going to happen well you know when you're in the markets for 50
[2:01:08.080 --> 2:01:12.080]  years you have seen what things do
[2:01:12.080 --> 2:01:16.080]  and so essentially the general stock market and so
[2:01:16.080 --> 2:01:20.080]  closely watched by so many people over their period of time
[2:01:20.080 --> 2:01:24.080]  that many of them come up with just such
[2:01:24.080 --> 2:01:28.080]  prognostications but they're usually independent
[2:01:28.080 --> 2:01:32.080]  because major brokerage firms banks insurance companies government
[2:01:32.080 --> 2:01:36.080]  they don't want you to come up with those sort of things because they want the markets to go up forever
[2:01:36.080 --> 2:01:40.080]  and everybody lives happily ever after and of course life isn't that way
[2:01:40.080 --> 2:01:44.080]  but the you could see the deterioration
[2:01:44.080 --> 2:01:48.080]  coming it started with the fall of
[2:01:48.080 --> 2:01:52.080]  the housing market which we called and the last half of
[2:01:52.080 --> 2:01:56.080]  2005 and in fact we even
[2:01:56.080 --> 2:02:00.080]  said ahead of time a year ahead when it would begin and
[2:02:00.080 --> 2:02:04.080]  it did and we called the recession two years ago February
[2:02:04.080 --> 2:02:08.080]  we were right we called a depression this past February
[2:02:08.080 --> 2:02:12.080]  and we're going to be right and these things that are going
[2:02:12.080 --> 2:02:16.080]  on you're seeing in the market come from two directions
[2:02:16.080 --> 2:02:20.080]  number one the play in the volatility in the markets
[2:02:20.080 --> 2:02:24.080]  it's not only created by buyers and sellers today
[2:02:24.080 --> 2:02:28.080]  probably 80-85% of all the trades are done
[2:02:28.080 --> 2:02:32.080]  by black boxes and quantum theory and
[2:02:32.080 --> 2:02:36.080]  things like that and so
[2:02:36.080 --> 2:02:40.080]  much more volatility than has ever been experienced
[2:02:40.080 --> 2:02:44.080]  in any market and so what happens is that
[2:02:44.080 --> 2:02:48.080]  you've got to look at the fundamental economic picture
[2:02:48.080 --> 2:02:52.080]  and that's where you've got to draw your long term conclusions from
[2:02:52.080 --> 2:02:56.080]  I don't try to call short term flow
[2:02:56.080 --> 2:03:00.080]  in the market or in any market for that matter it's just too difficult
[2:03:00.080 --> 2:03:04.080]  especially when you have government interceding in the markets all the time
[2:03:04.080 --> 2:03:08.080]  and so you pick the trend
[2:03:08.080 --> 2:03:12.080]  and the trend in the stock market is down and I think
[2:03:12.080 --> 2:03:16.080]  it will continue to go down until it reaches a bottom somewhere
[2:03:16.080 --> 2:03:20.080]  and then it will go flat now and then things hopefully will get better
[2:03:20.080 --> 2:03:24.080]  and then the cycles will start all over again
[2:03:24.080 --> 2:03:28.080]  and the same thing applies to precious metals they go up and down like a yo-yo
[2:03:28.080 --> 2:03:32.080]  as well and you know I get letters from people
[2:03:32.080 --> 2:03:36.080]  my goodness gracious I can't stand this anymore and I write back to them
[2:03:36.080 --> 2:03:40.080]  and say well what's your alternative you don't have one
[2:03:40.080 --> 2:03:44.080]  so go along and stay long in the market that's in the bull market
[2:03:44.080 --> 2:03:48.080]  and that's in gold and silver
[2:03:48.080 --> 2:03:52.080]  what do you see the market doing in the next few months next year
[2:03:52.080 --> 2:03:56.080]  well first of all in the next few months I expect
[2:03:56.080 --> 2:04:00.080]  a revisit of the Dow Jones industrial average
[2:04:00.080 --> 2:04:04.080]  is around $8,100 back to test $6,600
[2:04:04.080 --> 2:04:08.080]  that is normal
[2:04:08.080 --> 2:04:12.080]  the market has gone up in like perhaps a month
[2:04:12.080 --> 2:04:16.080]  it's gone up almost 30% I mean that's unheard of
[2:04:16.080 --> 2:04:20.080]  and there was a number of factors why so now the market
[2:04:20.080 --> 2:04:24.080]  will go down and test to see if that $6,600 was a bottom
[2:04:24.080 --> 2:04:28.080]  I don't think so
[2:04:28.080 --> 2:04:32.080]  that's what you said
[2:04:32.080 --> 2:04:36.080]  that's what you said
[2:04:36.080 --> 2:04:40.080]  that's what you pointed out you said the veil out
[2:04:40.080 --> 2:04:44.080]  and the stimulus will just kind of
[2:04:44.080 --> 2:04:48.080]  make things stagnate and then what you're saying in about a year
[2:04:48.080 --> 2:04:52.080]  then it will really start going back into hyperinflation give us
[2:04:52.080 --> 2:04:56.080]  I mean exactly where you see this going you were right about that too
[2:04:56.080 --> 2:05:00.080]  when we come back and then more of your phone calls folks stay with us
[2:05:00.080 --> 2:05:04.080]  did you know that the new energy czar wants to
[2:05:04.080 --> 2:05:08.080]  control how much power your electrical company allows you to have
[2:05:08.080 --> 2:05:12.080]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[2:05:12.080 --> 2:05:16.080]  smart grid technology is coming not if but when
[2:05:16.080 --> 2:05:20.080]  hi Bill I just wanted to call in and let you folks know that I got my

[2:06:04.080 --> 2:06:08.080]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear
[2:06:08.080 --> 2:06:12.080]  we've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think
[2:06:12.080 --> 2:06:16.080]  all of us would like to see the Obama deception completely destroys
[2:06:16.080 --> 2:06:20.080]  the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people

[2:06:24.080 --> 2:06:28.080]  if you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality
[2:06:28.080 --> 2:06:32.080]  cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme
[2:06:32.080 --> 2:06:36.080]  bankers and finance oligarchs that's fascism
[2:06:36.080 --> 2:06:40.080]  it's not about left to right it's about a one world
[2:06:40.080 --> 2:06:44.080]  government this film documents who Obama works for

[2:08:14.080 --> 2:08:20.080]  we are now simulcasting the last hour for two minutes at prisonplanet.tv
[2:08:20.080 --> 2:08:25.080]  the newly redesigned and updated prisonplanet.tv be sure to check it out
[2:08:25.080 --> 2:08:30.080]  bob chatman is with us to the bottom of the hour then i want to play a short extra
[2:08:30.080 --> 2:08:34.080]  for prisonplanet.tv viewers
[2:08:34.080 --> 2:08:38.080]  the listeners on the radio will be able to hear the audio
[2:08:38.080 --> 2:08:42.080]  it's also very effective in letting you know what's happening
[2:08:42.080 --> 2:08:46.080]  where they're breaking christians arms and federal courts ruled
[2:08:46.080 --> 2:08:50.080]  that they're allowed the police are allowed to torture you and break bones
[2:08:50.080 --> 2:08:54.080]  as part of paying compliance you don't get out of a car they can break your arm
[2:08:54.080 --> 2:08:58.080]  to make you do it you don't get to
[2:08:58.080 --> 2:09:02.080]  sit down from an abortion clinic they can break your arm the bone can stick out
[2:09:02.080 --> 2:09:06.080]  now the youtube lets you see the fake cia beheading videos
[2:09:06.080 --> 2:09:10.080]  which have been staged with the heads being sought off
[2:09:10.080 --> 2:09:14.080]  but what they don't let you see is this when this gets uploaded to youtube it gets
[2:09:14.080 --> 2:09:18.080]  taken down or they say adult content gets blocked
[2:09:18.080 --> 2:09:22.080]  so that is coming up and i mean all it is is breaking americans arms and that's on
[2:09:22.080 --> 2:09:26.080]  tv all the time you know all the seven o'clock at night it's on during the family hour
[2:09:26.080 --> 2:09:30.080]  but this is real you're going to see arms compound
[2:09:30.080 --> 2:09:34.080]  fractures and the police go right in front of cameras they had no big deal
[2:09:34.080 --> 2:09:38.080]  this is torture so of course
[2:09:38.080 --> 2:09:42.080]  what's happening at Abu Ghraib is torture as well i want to blitz through these calls but
[2:09:42.080 --> 2:09:46.080]  Bob specifically i remember you saying it would go up
[2:09:46.080 --> 2:09:50.080]  like it did a few years ago and then back down and you even said in a few months i see it
[2:09:50.080 --> 2:09:54.080]  going down to you know 66 and then i see it going up to 8000
[2:09:54.080 --> 2:09:58.080]  and then i see it going back down again and you're even doing it month to month
[2:09:58.080 --> 2:10:02.080]  accurately when will there be the big plunge or will they
[2:10:02.080 --> 2:10:06.080]  just start hyper inflating in a year and the stock market will reflect that
[2:10:06.080 --> 2:10:10.080]  maybe the stock market will be at you know not 15,000 but 100,000
[2:10:10.080 --> 2:10:14.080]  it's just it won't be worth as much or what's going to happen
[2:10:14.080 --> 2:10:18.080]  well the market is going to go down and we're not going to get
[2:10:18.080 --> 2:10:22.080]  a hyper market it just isn't going to happen well get hyper
[2:10:22.080 --> 2:10:26.080]  inflation as soon as the money that was lent to the banks by the fed
[2:10:26.080 --> 2:10:30.080]  that was then lent back and stored with the fed
[2:10:30.080 --> 2:10:34.080]  is put into action now right now they're not
[2:10:34.080 --> 2:10:38.080]  using that money to keep it on the balance sheet to ostensibly
[2:10:38.080 --> 2:10:42.080]  make themselves strong and receive about 1% interest
[2:10:42.080 --> 2:10:46.080]  for virtually doing nothing and it's sort of like a
[2:10:46.080 --> 2:10:50.080]  washed sale and so sooner or later
[2:10:50.080 --> 2:10:54.080]  banks are going to have to use that money to keep the economy going
[2:10:54.080 --> 2:10:58.080]  how far away is that we don't know yet
[2:10:58.080 --> 2:11:02.080]  probably next year but in the meantime we're
[2:11:02.080 --> 2:11:06.080]  still going to have inflation for because M3 which they don't
[2:11:06.080 --> 2:11:10.080]  publish anymore is expanding at about 18%
[2:11:10.080 --> 2:11:14.080]  again and in other countries it's even higher China's
[2:11:14.080 --> 2:11:18.080]  over 25% and that money
[2:11:18.080 --> 2:11:22.080]  and credit that's being expanded by many major
[2:11:22.080 --> 2:11:26.080]  governments is going to cause ongoing inflation
[2:11:26.080 --> 2:11:30.080]  and the money that is being created by the fed and is being
[2:11:30.080 --> 2:11:34.080]  created through borrowing by the fiscal part of our government
[2:11:34.080 --> 2:11:38.080]  which is our government looking for money to pay
[2:11:38.080 --> 2:11:42.080]  interest more than anything else and run the government because the revenues
[2:11:42.080 --> 2:11:46.080]  are falling as well and that is going to continue
[2:11:46.080 --> 2:11:50.080]  to push inflation higher again
[2:11:50.080 --> 2:11:54.080]  and then once they take this money that banks have
[2:11:54.080 --> 2:11:58.080]  out of sterilization as it's called then the thing will just go berserk
[2:11:58.080 --> 2:12:02.080]  I can't put a timing on that yet but it's
[2:12:02.080 --> 2:12:06.080]  going to happen I'll see probably a month or two ahead when
[2:12:06.080 --> 2:12:10.080]  they're going to begin it but they haven't begun it as yet
[2:12:10.080 --> 2:12:14.080]  and quite frankly I thought they would have
[2:12:14.080 --> 2:12:18.080]  and you said it would take two or three years and most of the other people we talked to
[2:12:18.080 --> 2:12:22.080]  or your caliber of research are saying something similar so we're a year and a half out
[2:12:22.080 --> 2:12:26.080]  probably or you're saying it could come sooner
[2:12:26.080 --> 2:12:30.080]  the chances are a year and a half out to two years
[2:12:30.080 --> 2:12:34.080]  but it could come soon because of that untoward event I explained
[2:12:34.080 --> 2:12:38.080]  earlier there are things that happen that nobody can control
[2:12:38.080 --> 2:12:42.080]  okay one more point like China or somebody pulling out
[2:12:42.080 --> 2:12:46.080]  a new take on this
[2:12:46.080 --> 2:12:50.080]  it was in the New York Times they even had a graph showing how China had been
[2:12:50.080 --> 2:12:54.080]  increasing its purchase of US bonds that back our debt for those that don't know
[2:12:54.080 --> 2:12:58.080]  now they've suddenly reversed and it was a huge drop I don't have the numbers in front of me I'm sure you do
[2:12:58.080 --> 2:13:02.080]  and it showed other countries are now it appears
[2:13:02.080 --> 2:13:06.080]  the move from the dollar they've gone to baskets and started buying a little bit of other stuff
[2:13:06.080 --> 2:13:10.080]  but now China and others are buying gold, silver, copper
[2:13:10.080 --> 2:13:14.080]  they're not dealing at all and other countries it appears we're now really starting to see
[2:13:14.080 --> 2:13:18.080]  the flight away from the dollar coinciding with this talk about a new world
[2:13:18.080 --> 2:13:22.080]  reserve currency with more G20 meetings coming up
[2:13:22.080 --> 2:13:26.080]  all of that is true and actually it's a flight from all currencies
[2:13:26.080 --> 2:13:30.080]  because in Europe you have people buying gold coins and bars
[2:13:30.080 --> 2:13:34.080]  and they're not dealing in dollars they're dealing in euros
[2:13:34.080 --> 2:13:38.080]  so you're seeing a flight to quality from all currencies
[2:13:38.080 --> 2:13:42.080]  small at this time but it'll grow larger
[2:13:42.080 --> 2:13:46.080]  and that will happen in an evolutionary process
[2:13:46.080 --> 2:13:50.080]  because all of the major countries G20 and more are making
[2:13:50.080 --> 2:13:54.080]  the same mistakes that we are grasping at straws because the politicians
[2:13:54.080 --> 2:13:58.080]  don't want to be around when the phone calls out. So the Indian government
[2:13:58.080 --> 2:14:02.080]  the Chinese government the Russian government the Japanese government they're moving into
[2:14:02.080 --> 2:14:06.080]  precious metals across the board including industrial metals like copper
[2:14:06.080 --> 2:14:10.080]  you can just google government's buying copper and it's a run on copper
[2:14:10.080 --> 2:14:14.080]  there's a run to commodities real commodities and you're right
[2:14:14.080 --> 2:14:18.080]  there's a flight from currencies globally and so I guess they've got to kill the global currencies
[2:14:18.080 --> 2:14:22.080]  to bring in the real world currency
[2:14:22.080 --> 2:14:26.080]  well and I don't think it's going to be SDRs because they've been unsuccessful before
[2:14:26.080 --> 2:14:30.080]  they're backed by nothing and I think what they'll do
[2:14:30.080 --> 2:14:34.080]  is go for a basket of currencies and say that we're going to have gold backing
[2:14:34.080 --> 2:14:38.080]  in fact they won't and that's the way I think they're going to get away with trying
[2:14:38.080 --> 2:14:42.080]  to make their world currency but because of programs like this
[2:14:42.080 --> 2:14:46.080]  people are aware that this is what they're up to and they're not going to let that
[2:14:46.080 --> 2:14:50.080]  happen in their country whether it's Colombia or Bolivia
[2:14:50.080 --> 2:14:54.080]  or Tashkent or wherever it is
[2:14:54.080 --> 2:14:58.080]  that's right a global government setting the currency rates
[2:14:58.080 --> 2:15:02.080]  let's go to the calls here thanks for holding Paul in Florida you're on the air
[2:15:02.080 --> 2:15:06.080]  Alex? Hi
[2:15:06.080 --> 2:15:10.080]  yeah I've been in InfoWars since 1981
[2:15:10.080 --> 2:15:14.080]  my punk band from Florida is saying about everything that's happening right now
[2:15:14.080 --> 2:15:18.080]  but I'm hard to keep on subject I really appreciate your work
[2:15:18.080 --> 2:15:22.080]  I just wanted to talk about what you mentioned early in the show
[2:15:22.080 --> 2:15:26.080]  which is torture
[2:15:26.080 --> 2:15:30.080]  you know the Delta Force they're like federal agents
[2:15:30.080 --> 2:15:34.080]  whatever they like they don't wear ranking badges
[2:15:34.080 --> 2:15:38.080]  they're under the National Security Council that's Cheney's hit team
[2:15:38.080 --> 2:15:42.080]  it's only Bush now it's been around for decades it's still going on
[2:15:42.080 --> 2:15:46.080]  and it's not even really part of the military yes
[2:15:46.080 --> 2:15:50.080]  and I think it was them who moved into the World Trade Center to wire all the explosives
[2:15:50.080 --> 2:15:54.080]  and I have an army friend who was at Fort Dietrich Maryland and he told me
[2:15:54.080 --> 2:15:58.080]  about how they choose their members they look for sick
[2:15:58.080 --> 2:16:02.080]  demented people who are
[2:16:02.080 --> 2:16:06.080]  who would confirm as yes men and who get off on
[2:16:06.080 --> 2:16:10.080]  being plugged into the chain of command
[2:16:10.080 --> 2:16:14.080]  as if they were the top gun
[2:16:14.080 --> 2:16:18.080]  I heard Limbaugh about 10 years ago and then I confirmed it
[2:16:18.080 --> 2:16:22.080]  with the Delta Force and other secret groups after that
[2:16:22.080 --> 2:16:26.080]  they give them after they've gone through all these months of training and the psychological warfare
[2:16:26.080 --> 2:16:30.080]  and all the tests and all these guys have
[2:16:30.080 --> 2:16:34.080]  washed out you know from the Navy Seals and Marine Force recon
[2:16:34.080 --> 2:16:38.080]  and the Green Berets you know it's this joint deal
[2:16:38.080 --> 2:16:42.080]  they then put them in a little shack with Machiavelli's The Prince
[2:16:42.080 --> 2:16:46.080]  and they ask them to write an essay on it it's like they do high level masons
[2:16:46.080 --> 2:16:50.080]  and if they say oh I don't agree with them justifies the means and doing all these evil things
[2:16:50.080 --> 2:16:54.080]  to you know for the greater good in the end they go oh
[2:16:54.080 --> 2:16:58.080]  you don't pass but we want you for something else but if you say
[2:16:58.080 --> 2:17:02.080]  oh yes I think doing evil for good is good
[2:17:02.080 --> 2:17:06.080]  they say that's it you graduate and they also and then they do other psychological testing but go ahead
[2:17:06.080 --> 2:17:10.080]  yeah and so what my my idea is that what they're going to do is
[2:17:10.080 --> 2:17:14.080]  when they need a chain of command it's going to listen they're going to put these guys
[2:17:14.080 --> 2:17:18.080]  in the chain of command just under the newer order structure
[2:17:18.080 --> 2:17:22.080]  and under them they're going to put a lot of the people they've recruited from the
[2:17:22.080 --> 2:17:26.080]  from the gangs and then under them the foot soldiers so that they'll
[2:17:26.080 --> 2:17:30.080]  try to keep what looks like a chain of command that's listening
[2:17:30.080 --> 2:17:34.080]  and so there's a polarization the good people like us were coming together
[2:17:34.080 --> 2:17:38.080]  and they're coming together under power just like in the cities people in gangs come together
[2:17:38.080 --> 2:17:42.080]  for power and this only safe place would be in the woods now there's
[2:17:42.080 --> 2:17:46.080]  the erase and then there's the rewrite we know this whole system might fall apart
[2:17:46.080 --> 2:17:50.080]  and break down it's what we do after that right on the moment
[2:17:50.080 --> 2:17:54.080]  to keep civil society together protect our children protect the family unit
[2:17:54.080 --> 2:17:58.080]  unit and I worked extensively on what could happen
[2:17:58.080 --> 2:18:02.080]  possibly there and even had visions in and visits from
[2:18:02.080 --> 2:18:06.080]  jealous forces you know while in hermitage for a year prayer on this
[2:18:06.080 --> 2:18:10.080]  but uh... anyway back on the thing
[2:18:10.080 --> 2:18:14.080]  I'm going to let you go that's interesting I want to write an article about that
[2:18:14.080 --> 2:18:18.080]  you sound like an interesting person you know going back to Bob Chapman
[2:18:18.080 --> 2:18:22.080]  that's the big goal of the elite I mean they're totally ruthless once you commit all this evil
[2:18:22.080 --> 2:18:26.080]  the next evil you know uh... it's no big deal once you've
[2:18:26.080 --> 2:18:30.080]  I mean it's like I've said I won't do anything immoral
[2:18:30.080 --> 2:18:34.080]  because I know that if I'm going to be evil I might as well just go all the way
[2:18:34.080 --> 2:18:38.080]  and I know where that leads I don't want to do it but the government's problem
[2:18:38.080 --> 2:18:42.080]  is they're always trying to find people that'll do what they're told and to test them
[2:18:42.080 --> 2:18:46.080]  then they don't trust each other that's why they had all the biological chemical
[2:18:46.080 --> 2:18:50.080]  testing killing innocent troops and children and foster kids it's all
[2:18:50.080 --> 2:18:54.080]  declassified was to create cadres of scientists who
[2:18:54.080 --> 2:18:58.080]  were mentally ill and believed in justifies the means to then
[2:18:58.080 --> 2:19:02.080]  take those guys and that's it's those scientists they created
[2:19:02.080 --> 2:19:06.080]  that's actually at the highest level of the new world order it's banking families
[2:19:06.080 --> 2:19:10.080]  and then scientists that they found agree with them Bob is that
[2:19:10.080 --> 2:19:14.080]  been what your research found absolutely and
[2:19:14.080 --> 2:19:18.080]  they they even have them have them categorized and
[2:19:18.080 --> 2:19:22.080]  you know what's the best place for this person to be
[2:19:22.080 --> 2:19:26.080]  as long as the person is pliable
[2:19:26.080 --> 2:19:30.080]  they can use them almost anywhere that their talents fit
[2:19:30.080 --> 2:19:34.080]  and that's what these people do
[2:19:34.080 --> 2:19:38.080]  amazing Bob I want to come back and finish up with the economy and let you go then I'll continue with calls and a big

[2:24:02.080 --> 2:24:06.080]  ok let's go right back to Bob Chapman and then your calls are coming up
[2:24:06.080 --> 2:24:10.080]  and then I'm going to get into this torture video
[2:24:10.080 --> 2:24:14.080]  and the latest where the government is saying oh
[2:24:14.080 --> 2:24:18.080]  the CIA was following orders so it's ok they tortured
[2:24:18.080 --> 2:24:22.080]  this is an incredible precedent he's not rebuking torture he's confirming it all
[2:24:22.080 --> 2:24:26.080]  and saying hey what the Nazis did was good
[2:24:26.080 --> 2:24:30.080]  Nuremberg found him guilty they said now just because you're told to follow
[2:24:30.080 --> 2:24:34.080]  in order that's illegal it doesn't matter the government says
[2:24:34.080 --> 2:24:38.080]  it's ok it's illegal against the common law of humanity you will be held
[2:24:38.080 --> 2:24:42.080]  accountable well Obama says no we told him to do it so they're good guys
[2:24:42.080 --> 2:24:46.080]  yeah I bet they're good guys I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up just
[2:24:46.080 --> 2:24:50.080]  two or three minutes we're going to come back and go to your calls
[2:24:50.080 --> 2:24:54.080]  I said while we have Bob Chapman Ted I wanted to drag you on here because you told me
[2:24:54.080 --> 2:24:58.080]  it was a really hot item and I know why these are these things are really
[2:24:58.080 --> 2:25:02.080]  rare out there they go for a lot on eBay in places people can't
[2:25:02.080 --> 2:25:06.080]  get a regular silver dollar for less than 19-20 bucks online
[2:25:06.080 --> 2:25:10.080]  and Ted's got silver dollars you know for less than that
[2:25:10.080 --> 2:25:14.080]  but he also has these Lakota nation rounds which are
[2:25:14.080 --> 2:25:18.080]  put out by the Native American new nation that's declared sovereignty and
[2:25:18.080 --> 2:25:22.080]  they're really a hot item and Ted has them way way less
[2:25:22.080 --> 2:25:26.080]  than you'll find in any other place in fact Ted you bought them in so much bulk and you're passing
[2:25:26.080 --> 2:25:30.080]  that savings on to folks I mean this is what a 20-30% discount
[2:25:30.080 --> 2:25:34.080]  from where it's being sold to other places oh yeah I see these things as high as
[2:25:34.080 --> 2:25:38.080]  50 bucks some places even 100
[2:25:38.080 --> 2:25:42.080]  and if you're shopping on eBay they're about
[2:25:42.080 --> 2:25:46.080]  20-25 bucks and I have them currently right now for
[2:25:46.080 --> 2:25:50.080]  $50.50 now I don't know what makes them popular maybe it's
[2:25:50.080 --> 2:25:54.080]  because I haven't priced so low or the other thing is they have a $50
[2:25:54.080 --> 2:25:58.080]  face value on them too which obviously makes them
[2:25:58.080 --> 2:26:02.080]  very attractive as well the Lakota nation
[2:26:02.080 --> 2:26:06.080]  claiming sovereignty and getting into the Federal
[2:26:06.080 --> 2:26:10.080]  Reserve's face to me is enough to you know
[2:26:10.080 --> 2:26:14.080]  enough to support them right there well we also know the feds rated the Liberty dollar and they had
[2:26:14.080 --> 2:26:18.080]  all the gold and silver there and were shipping it out and that coin went from you know 15 bucks
[2:26:18.080 --> 2:26:22.080]  a piece to 500, 300 you know I mean that's one of the biggest collectors
[2:26:22.080 --> 2:26:26.080]  out there is that Ron Paul Liberty thing so I think you got a train wreck
[2:26:26.080 --> 2:26:30.080]  people looking for a train wreck here is another reason they're so high
[2:26:30.080 --> 2:26:34.080]  but you've got it basically at below
[2:26:34.080 --> 2:26:38.080]  what silver dollars that are junk are selling for so it's an insanely good deal
[2:26:38.080 --> 2:26:42.080]  how good of a deal is that Bob Chapman
[2:26:42.080 --> 2:26:46.080]  very good deal whenever you can buy an ounce
[2:26:46.080 --> 2:26:50.080]  at that price in this market today and you know
[2:26:50.080 --> 2:26:54.080]  Ted will tell you how difficult it is to get dimes
[2:26:54.080 --> 2:26:58.080]  and quarters and halves and silver eagles they're available
[2:26:58.080 --> 2:27:02.080]  but they certainly not available in size
[2:27:02.080 --> 2:27:06.080]  there's no way you can touch a silver eagle at this price right now Alex and Bob's right about that
[2:27:06.080 --> 2:27:10.080]  I mean the silver dollars, the dimes, the halves, the quarters
[2:27:10.080 --> 2:27:14.080]  all that stuff is in such short supply there's many times where I can't even
[2:27:14.080 --> 2:27:18.080]  sell them and that goes for months on end I mean here I have this coin
[2:27:18.080 --> 2:27:22.080]  it's a good as far as I'm concerned a good cause
[2:27:22.080 --> 2:27:26.080]  and you're going to get an ounce of silver at a price that I think is absolutely
[2:27:26.080 --> 2:27:30.080]  out of this world and you get that Lakota Nation coin
[2:27:30.080 --> 2:27:34.080]  I don't know how you can lose on this particular one it's a win-win situation
[2:27:34.080 --> 2:27:38.080]  absolutely not Ted you got gold at a really good price too tell folks about that real cool
[2:27:38.080 --> 2:27:42.080]  yeah absolutely I mean the Franks right now are 213 and we've got the British
[2:27:42.080 --> 2:27:46.080]  sovereigns at 265 I mean we've got US eagles
[2:27:46.080 --> 2:27:50.080]  all this stuff I mean because the prices right now in gold and silver
[2:27:50.080 --> 2:27:54.080]  are very favorable there's no question about it now is the time to be moving in
[2:27:54.080 --> 2:27:58.080]  most people like to move most people like to react to the market when something
[2:27:58.080 --> 2:28:02.080]  hot comes along then they jump on gold and they jump on silver but they end up paying
[2:28:02.080 --> 2:28:06.080]  a lot higher prices too right now you can buy this stuff it's deeply
[2:28:06.080 --> 2:28:10.080]  honored to where it was and all weekend
[2:28:10.080 --> 2:28:14.080]  folks are going to be there at minus resources until midnight every night
[2:28:14.080 --> 2:28:18.080]  1-800-686-2237-1800
[2:28:18.080 --> 2:28:22.080]  686-2237 and I want to ask Darth Vader
[2:28:22.080 --> 2:28:26.080]  Bob Chapman there beating up his telephone
[2:28:26.080 --> 2:28:30.080]  Bob how good a deal is that on the gold and
[2:28:30.080 --> 2:28:34.080]  should folks buy into it now
[2:28:34.080 --> 2:28:38.080]  because prices have come down and you know no one
[2:28:38.080 --> 2:28:42.080]  knows for sure where gold is going to go I think it's going higher
[2:28:42.080 --> 2:28:46.080]  it's testing its 200 day moving average right now and it will be
[2:28:46.080 --> 2:28:50.080]  interesting to see if it holds I think it will and you know
[2:28:50.080 --> 2:28:54.080]  as Ted and I have discussed on the year before people always
[2:28:54.080 --> 2:28:58.080]  want to buy when the price is going up the best time to
[2:28:58.080 --> 2:29:02.080]  buy is when the price is corrected and we've come down from 960
[2:29:02.080 --> 2:29:06.080]  recently twice and you know
[2:29:06.080 --> 2:29:10.080]  at 870 this is a good deal
[2:29:10.080 --> 2:29:14.080]  because the prices are much cheaper than they were before
[2:29:14.080 --> 2:29:18.080]  plus that's a month graph you look at the 5-year, the 10-year, the 1-year
[2:29:18.080 --> 2:29:22.080]  gold is going straight up and everything else is going straight down
[2:29:22.080 --> 2:29:26.080]  800-686-2237-800-686-2237

[3:00:30.760 --> 3:00:33.160]  Right now we are taking phone calls.
[3:00:33.160 --> 3:00:39.760]  Bethany, in Maryland you are on the air where mainstream news reported the army was spying
[3:00:39.760 --> 3:00:43.840]  on the Tea Parties because we're enemies of America, but of course the army has been
[3:00:43.840 --> 3:00:47.760]  ordered to spy on the army too by the criminals running the government because they say people
[3:00:47.760 --> 3:00:52.400]  that love freedom and the Second Amendment are terrorists now in America and the cat
[3:00:52.400 --> 3:00:53.400]  is out of the bag.
[3:00:53.400 --> 3:00:54.400]  Bethany, go ahead.
[3:00:54.400 --> 3:00:57.600]  Hi Alex, how are you today?
[3:00:57.600 --> 3:00:58.600]  Pretty good.
[3:00:58.600 --> 3:00:59.840]  Good to be here with you on this Friday.
[3:00:59.840 --> 3:01:02.760]  Sweet, listen, you are just the best.
[3:01:02.760 --> 3:01:05.600]  I get such joy listening to you every day.
[3:01:05.600 --> 3:01:06.960]  I'm addicted to your program.
[3:01:06.960 --> 3:01:11.360]  I've just come upon you recently, my husband's gone crazy because all I want to do is listen
[3:01:11.360 --> 3:01:12.360]  to you night and day.
[3:01:12.360 --> 3:01:17.160]  The kids are like, oh no, not Alex Jones again, mommy.
[3:01:17.160 --> 3:01:18.160]  But it's all good.
[3:01:18.160 --> 3:01:19.160]  It's all good.
[3:01:19.160 --> 3:01:25.680]  One of the things that I wanted to ask you is something that's very troubling to me,
[3:01:25.680 --> 3:01:29.760]  the Codex Alimentarius.
[3:01:29.760 --> 3:01:34.080]  I never hear any sort of discussion taking place about that.
[3:01:34.080 --> 3:01:39.040]  Well, we just talked about the bill to restrict and shut down organic farms, small family
[3:01:39.040 --> 3:01:44.240]  farms, animal ID, premises ID, SWAT teaming, organic egg sellers on the side of the highway,
[3:01:44.240 --> 3:01:50.560]  SWAT teaming, food pantries, Codex Alimentarius is admitted that UN has the meetings.
[3:01:50.560 --> 3:01:54.400]  You'll see a blurb in the news like, oh, vitamin B now, can't be over the counter.
[3:01:54.400 --> 3:01:57.840]  The government wants to make it, you know, be a prescription.
[3:01:57.840 --> 3:02:01.640]  That's what's, or they go out and patent vitamins and then say, it's like they patent seeds
[3:02:01.640 --> 3:02:03.800]  and say you can't have them.
[3:02:03.800 --> 3:02:06.600]  So yes, it's a big deal and it's happening.
[3:02:06.600 --> 3:02:07.720]  These are monopoly men.
[3:02:07.720 --> 3:02:12.040]  The globalists want monopolies and big government can enforce their monopolies.
[3:02:12.040 --> 3:02:13.040]  Uh-huh.
[3:02:13.040 --> 3:02:14.040]  Uh-huh.
[3:02:14.040 --> 3:02:15.040]  But I mean, you had a comment on it.
[3:02:15.040 --> 3:02:16.040]  Go ahead.
[3:02:16.040 --> 3:02:21.200]  Well, my comment is that I'd love to just, I guess, hear a little bit more about it because
[3:02:21.200 --> 3:02:25.880]  the readings that I've found is that it's supposed to be implemented globally, December
[3:02:25.880 --> 3:02:28.200]  31st, 2009.
[3:02:28.200 --> 3:02:36.280]  And I guess what that entails is mandatory antibiotics and bovine growth hormones in all
[3:02:36.280 --> 3:02:43.160]  food animals that nutritional supplements will be deemed harmful, like you were saying.
[3:02:43.160 --> 3:02:48.320]  We won't have foods that are labeled anymore to tell us if they're genetically, if they've
[3:02:48.320 --> 3:02:51.680]  been genetically modified.
[3:02:51.680 --> 3:02:54.880]  And I just don't know if they're going to be doing this like an increment or whether
[3:02:54.880 --> 3:02:59.560]  December 31st is going to be just an array of things that are just going to come out
[3:02:59.560 --> 3:03:00.560]  of a hat, so to speak.
[3:03:00.560 --> 3:03:01.560]  No, no.
[3:03:01.560 --> 3:03:03.000]  Everything they do is incremental.
[3:03:03.000 --> 3:03:07.280]  So you're hearing there will be police officers and they're creating new divisions of land
[3:03:07.280 --> 3:03:08.360]  management.
[3:03:08.360 --> 3:03:09.360]  They're here.
[3:03:09.360 --> 3:03:10.800]  Oh, you didn't get the form.
[3:03:10.800 --> 3:03:12.120]  We're going to arrest you.
[3:03:12.120 --> 3:03:16.000]  How did you get into the high school fair with your pig?
[3:03:16.000 --> 3:03:17.000]  This is happening.
[3:03:17.000 --> 3:03:20.000]  You know, like acting like the girl's a criminal, leading her off.
[3:03:20.000 --> 3:03:23.360]  So just lots of enforcement, lots of swarming.
[3:03:23.360 --> 3:03:29.360]  And so it's all part of a larger program as the drug companies, especially the military
[3:03:29.360 --> 3:03:34.160]  industrial complex, the drug companies, the media complex, and that's all owned by the
[3:03:34.160 --> 3:03:35.160]  big banks.
[3:03:35.160 --> 3:03:37.960]  They just create money out of nothing and then we pay interest on the debt they create
[3:03:37.960 --> 3:03:39.440]  out of nothing.
[3:03:39.440 --> 3:03:41.280]  And so they're just incrementally doing it.
[3:03:41.280 --> 3:03:45.560]  But the incrementalism is sped up before it was like this and now it's going like that
[3:03:45.560 --> 3:03:49.040]  and soon it's going to be going, yeah, you know, it's just going faster and faster like
[3:03:49.040 --> 3:03:51.640]  a dynamo or the RPMs in your car.
[3:03:51.640 --> 3:03:57.360]  You know, they kind of had a thousand RPMs in 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, 6000, 8000 and
[3:03:57.360 --> 3:03:59.360]  now the thing's about 10,000 RPMs.
[3:03:59.360 --> 3:04:02.640]  I mean, this is serious.
[3:04:02.640 --> 3:04:05.400]  And we purchase organic milk.
[3:04:05.400 --> 3:04:06.400]  We live in Maryland.
[3:04:06.400 --> 3:04:10.880]  We purchase the milk from Pennsylvania and Amish Farmer that comes down and delivers
[3:04:10.880 --> 3:04:14.440]  it and in a way of different products.
[3:04:14.440 --> 3:04:18.320]  People kind of mentioned that it was going, I was about to say, we kind of got mentioned
[3:04:18.320 --> 3:04:22.960]  after they were already case it, they had, they had stakeouts at the, at the farmers
[3:04:22.960 --> 3:04:28.480]  market in Austin for the Amish coming and literally like a drug deal, the fresh milk
[3:04:28.480 --> 3:04:31.640]  that everybody used to be able to get that statistically a lot safer.
[3:04:31.640 --> 3:04:34.480]  You know, so, so, oh, let me guess what happened.
[3:04:34.480 --> 3:04:36.000]  He can't bring the milk now.
[3:04:36.000 --> 3:04:41.680]  Well, interesting enough, there was the Pennsylvania Department of Ag has, has followed him and
[3:04:41.680 --> 3:04:44.640]  I guess he's been harassing, they've been harassing him for the past year.
[3:04:44.640 --> 3:04:45.640]  Oh yeah.
[3:04:45.640 --> 3:04:47.840]  There's secret police everywhere, ma'am, on every issue.
[3:04:47.840 --> 3:04:51.000]  They're calling organic milk terrorism in some of these documents.
[3:04:51.000 --> 3:04:52.160]  I'm not joking.
[3:04:52.160 --> 3:04:56.320]  They call that the farm, you know, terrorism.
[3:04:56.320 --> 3:04:57.320]  So listen, God bless you.
[3:04:57.320 --> 3:05:01.760]  We'll be right back with Raleigh James, syndicate of talk show host, I'm Alex Jones.
[3:05:01.760 --> 3:05:05.760]  Have you ever read the ingredients in your skin creams, personal hygiene products, vitamins
[3:05:05.760 --> 3:05:07.160]  or herbal supplements?
[3:05:07.160 --> 3:05:11.160]  Did you know that most skin creams, body lotions, shampoos and toothpaste contain chemical
[3:05:11.160 --> 3:05:15.720]  additives such as sodium, laurel sulfate, the same type of detergent used in dish soap?
[3:05:15.720 --> 3:05:19.240]  Did you know that many multi-vitamin supplements are made from synthetic vitamins?
[3:05:19.240 --> 3:05:22.520]  Do your herbal remedies have unwanted additives and fillers?
[3:05:22.520 --> 3:05:25.080]  Have you ever tested your body's pH level?
[3:05:25.080 --> 3:05:28.160]  Make the change to organic health and beauty products.

[3:06:02.160 --> 3:06:07.600]  In the new world order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:06:07.600 --> 3:06:14.240]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[3:06:14.240 --> 3:06:15.520]  just as well funded.
[3:06:15.520 --> 3:06:20.680]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[3:06:20.680 --> 3:06:22.160]  of the American people.
[3:06:22.160 --> 3:06:26.560]  While Obama's already fudging, fudged since day one in this election.
[3:06:26.560 --> 3:06:31.680]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[3:06:31.680 --> 3:06:38.200]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[3:06:38.200 --> 3:06:41.760]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one world government.
[3:06:41.760 --> 3:06:48.680]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told and his real agenda.

[3:06:56.880 --> 3:07:02.080]  The Obama deception, the people strike back.
[3:07:02.080 --> 3:07:06.120]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political
[3:07:06.120 --> 3:07:10.240]  problems facing the US and the world, and for the first time in their lives, they are
[3:07:10.240 --> 3:07:12.360]  feeling the need for preparedness.
[3:07:12.360 --> 3:07:16.840]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated
[3:07:16.840 --> 3:07:18.840]  foods for almost 40 years.

[3:07:23.520 --> 3:07:28.400]  Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish, with doubly-nameled cans and nitrogen
[3:07:28.400 --> 3:07:29.400]  packaging.

[3:07:37.480 --> 3:07:39.600]  ships within five business days.
[3:07:39.600 --> 3:07:41.680]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.

[3:08:02.840 --> 3:08:08.520]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:08:08.520 --> 3:08:15.360]  Well, syndicated talk show host, Raleigh James, is our guest, you can check out her website,
[3:08:15.360 --> 3:08:23.400]  Raleigh.net, R-O-L-L-Y-E.net, you can hear, no matter where you are, on XM Channel, week
[3:08:23.400 --> 3:08:30.720]  nights, 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. Eastern, that's 9 to midnight Central Center time, on Top
[3:08:30.720 --> 3:08:35.520]  Channel 158, and I was just on there with her last week.
[3:08:35.520 --> 3:08:42.200]  I remember being in college, and I bring my old radio with me out of the apartment pool,
[3:08:42.200 --> 3:08:47.920]  me hanging out, talking to the college girls out there, suntanning with, listening to Raleigh
[3:08:47.920 --> 3:08:51.120]  James, thinking what a great talk show she was.
[3:08:51.120 --> 3:08:55.280]  Back when, you know, you're talking early 1990s, right when Clinton got in about Clinton
[3:08:55.280 --> 3:09:00.040]  being a murderer, and me and Arkansas and cocaine dealing, and let me tell you, you
[3:09:00.040 --> 3:09:03.480]  weren't hearing this anywhere on talk radio in the country.
[3:09:03.480 --> 3:09:08.680]  And the New World Order, and I'd already read about it and knew about it some, and I would
[3:09:08.680 --> 3:09:12.600]  say she got into the mix as instrumental, and me going, yeah, I want to get on the
[3:09:12.600 --> 3:09:16.160]  air and talk about this stuff, and I was taking some RTF then, and then got an access
[3:09:16.160 --> 3:09:21.280]  TV show, and then the Restless History, but it's great to have her on with us for the
[3:09:21.280 --> 3:09:24.960]  next 51 minutes, we'll take some calls later in the hour, got a bunch of news I want to
[3:09:24.960 --> 3:09:27.840]  cover with her, but Raleigh James, good to have you here with us.
[3:09:27.840 --> 3:09:34.080]  It's an honor, Alex, only for you would I wake up at the crack of noon.
[3:09:34.080 --> 3:09:37.720]  You were something else, you know, you've been doing talk radio for quite a long time,
[3:09:37.720 --> 3:09:38.720]  haven't you?
[3:09:38.720 --> 3:09:43.640]  Yeah, over 20 years, exclusively talk and radio over 40 years.
[3:09:43.640 --> 3:09:48.000]  Wow, so you've been doing that since you were a schoolgirl, basically.
[3:09:48.000 --> 3:09:51.880]  I guess, I guess, Limbaugh has been doing it since he was like eight years old.
[3:09:51.880 --> 3:09:58.120]  Raleigh, let's talk about, I mean, so much is going on, if I was guessing, what are you
[3:09:58.120 --> 3:10:02.920]  going to bring up first, because I haven't talked to you today, is it the federal reports
[3:10:02.920 --> 3:10:07.160]  saying the veterans and gun owners, the number one terror threat, or is it the White House
[3:10:07.160 --> 3:10:11.200]  openly announcing they want to license all internet reporters and basically shut the
[3:10:11.200 --> 3:10:16.360]  web down, or is it the IMF and World Bank saying we're in a depression, what's most
[3:10:16.360 --> 3:10:18.120]  important to you right now?
[3:10:18.120 --> 3:10:22.920]  Well, probably the thing that is always most important is the myth of the free press and
[3:10:22.920 --> 3:10:27.240]  why they want to continue that myth, and the folks who are thinking in terms of fairness
[3:10:27.240 --> 3:10:32.360]  doctrine, forget it, they are after the internet, and the Rosa Brooks article that you have
[3:10:32.360 --> 3:10:34.640]  on infowars.com is one tactic.
[3:10:34.640 --> 3:10:39.400]  They'll do anything they can, and I think that people are being led astray.
[3:10:39.400 --> 3:10:44.160]  For instance, I found the coverage of the Tea Party is interesting, and regardless of what
[3:10:44.160 --> 3:10:47.600]  people think in terms of whether that work didn't work, who was there, whether it was
[3:10:47.600 --> 3:10:53.440]  well-intentioned, the issue is immediately it was brought up off, this is Fox News.
[3:10:53.440 --> 3:10:58.200]  And the fascinating part to me on that is that to a good degree, they believe every
[3:10:58.200 --> 3:11:02.560]  bit of it, and they want to make sure that the myth of the free press continues, that
[3:11:02.560 --> 3:11:04.400]  we don't have that coverage.
[3:11:04.400 --> 3:11:08.960]  They are much more afraid of you long-term than they'll ever be afraid of Fox News.
[3:11:08.960 --> 3:11:12.960]  Well, that's why Fox News is trying to act like us now.
[3:11:12.960 --> 3:11:17.520]  I mean, you've been talking about this a lot longer than I have, and accurately and suddenly
[3:11:17.520 --> 3:11:21.240]  there's a new world order, there's a global currency, but don't worry, Rick Perry and
[3:11:21.240 --> 3:11:24.800]  the Republicans will save us when they're bought and paid for by the same people.
[3:11:24.800 --> 3:11:29.880]  So now that the Republicans are out of power, they can pose as the opposition, but that
[3:11:29.880 --> 3:11:35.480]  does show that now, though, that they know the opposition to the new world order is there,
[3:11:35.480 --> 3:11:40.280]  so now a major party is trying to camouflage themselves like us.
[3:11:40.280 --> 3:11:44.940]  I mean, this is a threat and a danger, but isn't it also very positive that they're
[3:11:44.940 --> 3:11:47.600]  now having to legitimize us?
[3:11:47.600 --> 3:11:53.200]  That is positive, but until we see any of the talking heads awaken and say they're
[3:11:53.200 --> 3:11:57.680]  Republicans and Demopublicans and this is going on above it, and until they say, yeah,
[3:11:57.680 --> 3:12:01.640]  the Federal Reserve, we understand, but let's look at the BIS, the Bank of International
[3:12:01.640 --> 3:12:06.160]  Settlements, until they're on that level, then really they're still a tool.
[3:12:06.160 --> 3:12:09.360]  Oh, by the way, it's back there in my office.
[3:12:09.360 --> 3:12:12.840]  You're like Alex, of course, you know about the International Bank of Settlements document
[3:12:12.840 --> 3:12:18.520]  where they admit in 2006 they were engineering this and I said no, and then you emailed it
[3:12:18.520 --> 3:12:22.440]  to me and it was off their website and that's going to be in the new film, but that shows
[3:12:22.440 --> 3:12:27.040]  none of us know at all or even half of it, so maybe we should cover that later.
[3:12:27.040 --> 3:12:31.720]  But yeah, these guys are right out in the open about what they're doing.
[3:12:31.720 --> 3:12:33.840]  Let's get into the Internet first, though.
[3:12:33.840 --> 3:12:37.360]  You had a caller on your show when I was on there a few days ago, and he said, I just
[3:12:37.360 --> 3:12:41.560]  don't believe you, Alex, that they could shut the web down and they're taking it over and
[3:12:41.560 --> 3:12:44.680]  I said, I'm reading you the bill, sir, where they say they're going to make all the private
[3:12:44.680 --> 3:12:49.720]  companies have NSA hubs in them to be able to shut the web off.
[3:12:49.720 --> 3:12:50.720]  That's in the bill.
[3:12:50.720 --> 3:12:54.600]  Senator Jay Rockefeller says he wants it and the guy just said, I can't believe you.
[3:12:54.600 --> 3:12:58.640]  They can't shut it down and you explained to him they could and they are moving towards
[3:12:58.640 --> 3:12:59.640]  that.
[3:12:59.640 --> 3:13:01.840]  Why do you think people are in such denial and bead?
[3:13:01.840 --> 3:13:05.000]  You want to explain to them because I thought you did it really well, better than I would,
[3:13:05.000 --> 3:13:08.400]  how they can control the web and some of the different tactics they're using.
[3:13:08.400 --> 3:13:13.920]  Well, I think people are in denial because it's a very comfortable place to be.
[3:13:13.920 --> 3:13:17.480]  If you wake up, if you start to listen to your show, Alex, and you listen just for a
[3:13:17.480 --> 3:13:22.320]  week, unless you're fully brain dead, it has agitated you to the point to realize that
[3:13:22.320 --> 3:13:25.560]  your world is not as you think it and maybe you'll have to get involved and people don't
[3:13:25.560 --> 3:13:26.560]  want to get involved.
[3:13:26.560 --> 3:13:28.760]  So the first thing they want to do is shoot the messenger.
[3:13:28.760 --> 3:13:32.680]  Oh, if it's coming from Alex or coming from Raleigh, then I don't have to believe it.
[3:13:32.680 --> 3:13:36.280]  So that's a human nature thing in terms of why they're there.
[3:13:36.280 --> 3:13:42.000]  But the most dangerous thing about the plan, and it is a plan, and it will happen, to control,
[3:13:42.000 --> 3:13:47.360]  if not shut down, control the internet, which is very easy to do, is the way it's been couched
[3:13:47.360 --> 3:13:49.600]  as free market decisions.
[3:13:49.600 --> 3:13:55.080]  When Comcast was first wanting to differentiate traffic so that they could in fact manage
[3:13:55.080 --> 3:13:56.080]  bandwidth.
[3:13:56.080 --> 3:13:58.080]  It's one thing to say we're going to limit the bandwidth overall.
[3:13:58.080 --> 3:14:01.200]  It's another thing to say a packet's not a packet and we're going to decide what gets
[3:14:01.200 --> 3:14:02.200]  through more quickly.
[3:14:02.200 --> 3:14:05.440]  And this is the whole issue of net neutrality or not.
[3:14:05.440 --> 3:14:06.440]  And that came up.
[3:14:06.440 --> 3:14:11.040]  The Federal Trade Commission couched it in very Republican terms when they said, well,
[3:14:11.040 --> 3:14:13.360]  this will be a free market decision.
[3:14:13.360 --> 3:14:16.800]  We're not going to get involved in the business practices.
[3:14:16.800 --> 3:14:21.680]  And the term free market, that's very comfortable to many people, libertarians included.
[3:14:21.680 --> 3:14:23.520]  This is not a free market decision.
[3:14:23.520 --> 3:14:24.520]  This is about control.
[3:14:24.520 --> 3:14:29.400]  And in terms of how you control it, well, the internet is not this amorphous thing with
[3:14:29.400 --> 3:14:32.480]  one little connection to you and one little connection to me.
[3:14:32.480 --> 3:14:39.480]  The way some people believe that it's a situation where it's more of this amorphous grid, all
[3:14:39.480 --> 3:14:42.000]  of it travels through bigger pipes.
[3:14:42.000 --> 3:14:46.080]  And in fact, when we were talking about the WorldCom bankruptcy and everybody talked
[3:14:46.080 --> 3:14:48.880]  about dark fiber, this is at the heart of it.
[3:14:48.880 --> 3:14:50.520]  They weren't using it then.
[3:14:50.520 --> 3:14:56.040]  But the reality is you don't get from point A to point B on some little spider web network.
[3:14:56.040 --> 3:14:58.680]  You're going over large pipes at some point.
[3:14:58.680 --> 3:15:02.120]  So all you have to do is moderate that pipe.
[3:15:02.120 --> 3:15:03.280]  You don't even have to shut it down.
[3:15:03.280 --> 3:15:04.280]  Just moderate it.
[3:15:04.280 --> 3:15:08.280]  And anyone who doubts that, look what's going on in Australia right now or what's always
[3:15:08.280 --> 3:15:13.480]  been going on in China, even for a Google who in many ways is the enemy, for them to
[3:15:13.480 --> 3:15:17.880]  get into China, they have to agree, well, we're going to limit what you can see.
[3:15:17.880 --> 3:15:20.560]  And it can be done with a keystroke.
[3:15:20.560 --> 3:15:25.360]  And there's other stuff, you know, Google hid the most viewed videos and for a while
[3:15:25.360 --> 3:15:27.760]  took it off even their front page.
[3:15:27.760 --> 3:15:31.360]  Now they've announced, oh, we're going to be like Hulu, which is their right to do,
[3:15:31.360 --> 3:15:33.000]  but now they're the big dominant system.
[3:15:33.000 --> 3:15:34.000]  They built it on.
[3:15:34.000 --> 3:15:35.000]  We're free.
[3:15:35.000 --> 3:15:36.000]  We're open.
[3:15:36.000 --> 3:15:39.720]  We're never going to censor you as long as it's your own content.
[3:15:39.720 --> 3:15:44.280]  And you know, and so the people built YouTube, and now they've gone back and they say, oh,
[3:15:44.280 --> 3:15:48.600]  we're going to make all the front pages now, CBS and Sony content, and we're going to have
[3:15:48.600 --> 3:15:57.440]  one little link to pages that we want to show you of the general public who have pages.
[3:15:57.440 --> 3:16:03.200]  And so they decide who to promote and literally wall off and censor and knock down the view
[3:16:03.200 --> 3:16:04.200]  counters.
[3:16:04.200 --> 3:16:09.160]  I mean, we've had videos of millions of views and they'll just take our little ribbon away,
[3:16:09.160 --> 3:16:10.680]  so we go off the main page.
[3:16:10.680 --> 3:16:12.840]  And they now admit they're doing that.
[3:16:12.840 --> 3:16:15.440]  YouTube is taking the you out of tube now.
[3:16:15.440 --> 3:16:17.160]  Oh, of course.
[3:16:17.160 --> 3:16:20.960]  And you know, you mentioned Google and I do call them the Antichrist in many ways.
[3:16:20.960 --> 3:16:27.320]  But going back to your Rosa Brooks article on how to and how to in fact foster newspaper
[3:16:27.320 --> 3:16:28.320]  readership.
[3:16:28.320 --> 3:16:33.280]  If you want to put it in the best terms, Google, you've heard about their plan to promote
[3:16:33.280 --> 3:16:34.280]  localism.
[3:16:34.280 --> 3:16:37.920]  Then no matter where you are, if you're looking for a new story, Google will only send you
[3:16:37.920 --> 3:16:40.680]  to your local paper.
[3:16:40.680 --> 3:16:46.000]  And that type of a relationship can only be possible again, if it's as easy as a keystroke
[3:16:46.000 --> 3:16:47.000]  to control.
[3:16:47.000 --> 3:16:52.920]  Well, remember, it's Yahoo and Google who have been contracted by the Chinese government
[3:16:52.920 --> 3:16:54.760]  to help them run the filters.
[3:16:54.760 --> 3:16:57.440]  Google runs the filters for China.
[3:16:57.440 --> 3:17:01.480]  Rupert Murdoch and Newscore runs the filters to be there and then that still wasn't enough
[3:17:01.480 --> 3:17:03.800]  for the Chinese government and they've shut some of it down.
[3:17:03.800 --> 3:17:10.520]  But you know, it's Yahoo turning over people in China, sending emails to activist groups
[3:17:10.520 --> 3:17:15.240]  in the U.S. and then they're getting prison sentences or being executed and Yahoo's proud
[3:17:15.240 --> 3:17:16.240]  of that.
[3:17:16.240 --> 3:17:22.200]  So to say they can't flip the same systems they've built on here is a fraud when they're
[3:17:22.200 --> 3:17:26.080]  even announcing far-own goods they're going to be doing it.
[3:17:26.080 --> 3:17:27.080]  Absolutely.
[3:17:27.080 --> 3:17:29.600]  And the Yahoo thing was just horrendous.
[3:17:29.600 --> 3:17:32.600]  And of course, major media gave that no play.
[3:17:32.600 --> 3:17:34.480]  But it's very simple to do.
[3:17:34.480 --> 3:17:39.440]  And actually, it's the business model that they have long before the censorship issue
[3:17:39.440 --> 3:17:44.720]  in order for, like you were saying with your films and it's so right, in order for them
[3:17:44.720 --> 3:17:49.040]  to succeed, they're going to wait the content the way they want to.
[3:17:49.040 --> 3:17:50.920]  And it can be done very subtly.
[3:17:50.920 --> 3:17:54.800]  It doesn't have to be done in such an effort where people will be saying, oh, the bootstraps
[3:17:54.800 --> 3:17:55.800]  got us.
[3:17:55.800 --> 3:17:57.640]  They can be done much more subtly than that.
[3:17:57.640 --> 3:18:01.920]  And it is as manipulative as anything you're seeing out of major media.
[3:18:01.920 --> 3:18:07.440]  The real key and the golden part of the Internet is the net neutrality part that if you put
[3:18:07.440 --> 3:18:12.280]  up info wars and I go there, I get there on the same route as if I go to Amazon or anyone
[3:18:12.280 --> 3:18:17.720]  else and other than hub control, which I'll leave out, the issue is that we're all equal.
[3:18:17.720 --> 3:18:22.400]  And that is the thing that absolutely the government wants to tear down and they will
[3:18:22.400 --> 3:18:23.960]  do it as a free market decision.
[3:18:23.960 --> 3:18:27.360]  And of course, the Googles and the Yahoos will be the leaders behind it because it benefits
[3:18:27.360 --> 3:18:28.360]  them.
[3:18:28.360 --> 3:18:32.640]  Well, we have to fight this now because look how many crazy things are happening right
[3:18:32.640 --> 3:18:33.640]  now.
[3:18:33.640 --> 3:18:37.160]  Listeners who we thought couldn't happen before, but it's happening.
[3:18:37.160 --> 3:18:39.040]  The elite is collapsing.
[3:18:39.040 --> 3:18:40.560]  The mainline newspapers are collapsing.
[3:18:40.560 --> 3:18:42.920]  Somebody wants to read their crap.
[3:18:42.920 --> 3:18:45.080]  The TV cable ratings are down.
[3:18:45.080 --> 3:18:47.160]  The system is in crisis.
[3:18:47.160 --> 3:18:48.940]  The lies are coming out.
[3:18:48.940 --> 3:18:51.280]  The alternative media is exploding.
[3:18:51.280 --> 3:18:54.360]  And so the newspaper owners have conventions and admit.
[3:18:54.360 --> 3:18:56.800]  And that's what the Obama administration is saying.
[3:18:56.800 --> 3:19:00.240]  Let us start restricting free speech media.
[3:19:00.240 --> 3:19:02.560]  Get behind us doing this or you're not going to have a job.
[3:19:02.560 --> 3:19:05.680]  So you're going to have government and the media teaming up together against the new
[3:19:05.680 --> 3:19:06.680]  media.
[3:19:06.680 --> 3:19:10.360]  The establishment can't have us on air unseating them.
[3:19:10.360 --> 3:19:12.320]  They, I mean, they're not going to go without a fight.
[3:19:12.320 --> 3:19:16.600]  Now that said, I want you to talk about this and get your take on it.
[3:19:16.600 --> 3:19:23.240]  The people have had this taste, though, four alternative, four real variety.
[3:19:23.240 --> 3:19:26.840]  Do you think they're going to be able to be successful in the long run, keeping people
[3:19:26.840 --> 3:19:27.840]  from this information?
[3:19:27.840 --> 3:19:29.800]  Now that they've had a taste of it?
[3:19:29.800 --> 3:19:32.280]  Depends how subtle they are at it.
[3:19:32.280 --> 3:19:33.800]  Everything they do is incrementalism.
[3:19:33.800 --> 3:19:36.040]  Like they're taking it out of the Fabian playbook.
[3:19:36.040 --> 3:19:41.880]  But their greatest fear is that the myth of the free press will become, in fact, unmasked.
[3:19:41.880 --> 3:19:46.920]  That we will know that it's no longer, if it's in the New York Times, that it's legit.
[3:19:46.920 --> 3:19:53.120]  And they are going to do anything they can to keep the average person unaware of exactly
[3:19:53.120 --> 3:19:54.120]  what we're talking about.
[3:19:54.120 --> 3:19:55.120]  Exactly.
[3:19:55.120 --> 3:19:58.720]  They admit the Defense Department finances most of the TV and media and it's all fake
[3:19:58.720 --> 3:19:59.720]  news.
[3:19:59.720 --> 3:20:00.720]  So there you go.
[3:20:00.720 --> 3:20:01.720]  Discredited there.
[3:20:01.720 --> 3:20:03.280]  Spring is here.
[3:20:03.280 --> 3:20:04.280]  Growing season.
[3:20:04.280 --> 3:20:06.160]  The economy is not getting any better.
[3:20:06.160 --> 3:20:08.040]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[3:20:08.040 --> 3:20:09.040]  Think about it.
[3:20:09.040 --> 3:20:13.200]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[3:20:13.200 --> 3:20:16.760]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.
[3:20:16.760 --> 3:20:18.720]  The country is running out of food.
[3:20:18.720 --> 3:20:21.480]  You need to get your seeds before it's too late.

[3:21:01.920 --> 3:21:08.040]  On the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:21:08.040 --> 3:21:12.520]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of
[3:21:12.520 --> 3:21:13.840]  us would like to see.
[3:21:13.840 --> 3:21:19.000]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[3:21:19.000 --> 3:21:20.400]  of the American people.
[3:21:20.400 --> 3:21:24.760]  While Obama's already fudging, fudged since day one in this election.
[3:21:24.760 --> 3:21:29.880]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[3:21:29.880 --> 3:21:37.960]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[3:21:37.960 --> 3:21:39.640]  It's not about left or right.
[3:21:39.640 --> 3:21:41.520]  It's about a one world government.
[3:21:41.520 --> 3:21:48.440]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[3:23:00.920 --> 3:23:05.880]  With food prices soaring to all time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what
[3:23:05.880 --> 3:23:10.040]  can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to
[3:23:10.040 --> 3:23:11.680]  your dinner table?
[3:23:11.680 --> 3:23:13.080]  Garden in a can.

[3:23:17.200 --> 3:23:20.880]  Garden in a can is ready when you are, plant them now or store them for when you really
[3:23:20.880 --> 3:23:21.880]  need them.

[3:25:03.360 --> 3:25:09.040]  a personal level has been schooled his entire lifetime to dislike and distrust the press
[3:25:09.040 --> 3:25:12.920]  unless he could manipulate it. And you talked very often about what he was doing on the
[3:25:12.920 --> 3:25:17.800]  campaign to reporters. So what they've got here is in addition to all their plans, they
[3:25:17.800 --> 3:25:22.920]  have someone who's emotionally poised to implement whatever it takes.
[3:25:22.920 --> 3:25:28.200]  Yeah, he really is slippery. I think he's more slippery than Bill Clinton because it
[3:25:28.200 --> 3:25:32.960]  always sounds great. But when you look right below the surface, it's always 170 or
[3:25:32.960 --> 3:25:37.800]  180. Sometimes it's a little true, but usually it's about 180 degrees a lie. It's just totally
[3:25:37.800 --> 3:25:41.440]  away from the truth.
[3:25:41.440 --> 3:25:45.240]  And now I've got Democrats writing editorials attacking me. I've got one here today and
[3:25:45.240 --> 3:25:49.280]  she says, yeah, he's lied about a bunch of stuff. He lied about things a little too
[3:25:49.280 --> 3:25:53.480]  quickly. It would have been alright if he lied later, but he did go back on his promises
[3:25:53.480 --> 3:25:58.280]  a little too quick. But still, Alex, you're the liar, but never says what I'm lying about.
[3:25:58.280 --> 3:26:03.640]  Well, they have to reposition you. They have to shoot the messenger. Whenever you've got
[3:26:03.640 --> 3:26:07.920]  a situation where the message is irrefutable, you've got to come at it at another angle
[3:26:07.920 --> 3:26:15.360]  and you know that. So demonizing you is the easiest way for them to remain in control,
[3:26:15.360 --> 3:26:18.760]  to make it seem that you are truly the lunatic fringe, so they're full of anything.
[3:26:18.760 --> 3:26:22.920]  But it's ridiculous. Like you said, though, this lady that wrote this latest hit piece,
[3:26:22.920 --> 3:26:27.960]  it's from Man Eater. It doesn't say anything I'm wrong about it. It just says, he's a crazy,
[3:26:27.960 --> 3:26:31.880]  crazy nut, flying saucers. I don't talk about flying saucers.
[3:26:31.880 --> 3:26:36.160]  Right, but they have to shoot the messenger. They'll claim, they'll claim he came off of
[3:26:36.160 --> 3:26:38.480]  the flying saucers if they have to.
[3:26:38.480 --> 3:26:40.320]  That's a good one.
[3:26:40.320 --> 3:26:44.080]  Unfortunately, it's tremendously effective because this is what I was saying before about
[3:26:44.080 --> 3:26:49.040]  the myth of the free press. The bulk of the population still buys it. For instance, the
[3:26:49.040 --> 3:26:52.560]  people who will say, if it's in the National Inquirer, I don't believe it, but if it's
[3:26:52.560 --> 3:26:56.680]  in the New York Times, I do. Well, with that litmus test, I'll take the Inquirer over the
[3:26:56.680 --> 3:27:04.280]  Times every day of the week, but people want to remain in that comfortable place where,
[3:27:04.280 --> 3:27:09.520]  oh, but it's not in the New York Times. So they still have what they want. They won't
[3:27:09.520 --> 3:27:14.840]  for long, and they know this, and they're seeing the cracks in it. And yeah, regardless
[3:27:14.840 --> 3:27:19.160]  of what they say about you for the record, they know how many people have watched your
[3:27:19.160 --> 3:27:24.560]  movies collectively, and they know that's in the tens of millions of people. So at this
[3:27:24.560 --> 3:27:29.160]  point, anything they can do to demonize you, they will because it's the only tool they've
[3:27:29.160 --> 3:27:30.160]  got.
[3:27:30.160 --> 3:27:34.480]  Well, I just hope it's not a prelude to something else. You've had a lot thrown at you over
[3:27:34.480 --> 3:27:40.720]  the years, been syndicated across the land. What is it like to go from, well, people always
[3:27:40.720 --> 3:27:44.200]  listen to you because you always had the facts were very convincing, but still, you know,
[3:27:44.200 --> 3:27:50.600]  some people disagreed to where now more and more everything we've said is almost passe
[3:27:50.600 --> 3:27:55.280]  now. It's just all out in the open, but they just put a different spin on it. The establishment
[3:27:55.280 --> 3:27:57.960]  does that it's a good thing.
[3:27:57.960 --> 3:28:03.600]  Well, that's the key. After they're done demonizing you, the next thing is to say, well, what
[3:28:03.600 --> 3:28:08.400]  he's saying is all folly. Of course, this is what he thought it was, you know, but he's
[3:28:08.400 --> 3:28:14.000]  getting two and two to equal 22, and it's always been four. And that's the method. And
[3:28:14.000 --> 3:28:20.520]  we're seeing that every day. Janet and Napolitano backtracking on the DHS thing. They're saying,
[3:28:20.520 --> 3:28:26.480]  oh, well, no, we weren't actually trying to demean the military. In other words, reposition
[3:28:26.480 --> 3:28:33.200]  it. If they can't reposition you, the next thing they have to do is reposition the message.
[3:28:33.200 --> 3:28:37.400]  But that's what a real tyranny does is it starts spying on its own military and police.
[3:28:37.400 --> 3:28:42.160]  And we know they've been doing that all along. I don't see things going too well for the
[3:28:42.160 --> 3:28:45.960]  new world order, though. I mean, I think it's going to be a rough ride, but I think they're
[3:28:45.960 --> 3:28:47.680]  in trouble. What do you think?
[3:28:47.680 --> 3:28:52.360]  Well, the more people awaken, the more they are. And you see that worldwide. The thing
[3:28:52.360 --> 3:28:57.360]  that they're very much afraid of is that as people are personally hurting, human nature
[3:28:57.360 --> 3:29:01.040]  takes over. And just like the riots across the world where they said, hell, no, you're
[3:29:01.040 --> 3:29:08.160]  not going to import foreigners to work here. We need these jobs. People do turn to self-protection.
[3:29:08.160 --> 3:29:14.120]  And that's a great fear. So they know what they're up against. But, you know, I mentioned
[3:29:14.120 --> 3:29:18.680]  the Fabians earlier, and you've talked about them a lot, too. The incrementalism, do everything
[3:29:18.680 --> 3:29:23.720]  in small increments. Well, what's happened now is we're on an exponential multiplier.
[3:29:23.720 --> 3:29:29.640]  We're now at the point where, in fact, it can be implemented. And so a lot of people
[3:29:29.640 --> 3:29:33.280]  are going for it. Do it all now. And you saw that with a lot of the early, well, you're
[3:29:33.280 --> 3:29:37.200]  still seeing it, but the really early legislation out of Obama. Get it all in now.
[3:29:37.200 --> 3:29:42.600]  All right. Long segment coming up. I'll stick a few calls. 1-800-259-9231. She's Raleigh

[3:31:03.400 --> 3:31:09.440]  War Against Humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear. We've got to have a civilian
[3:31:09.440 --> 3:31:16.240]  national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded. The Obama
[3:31:16.240 --> 3:31:21.000]  deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of
[3:31:21.000 --> 3:31:30.200]  the American people. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality
[3:31:30.200 --> 3:31:37.080]  cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs,
[3:31:37.080 --> 3:31:42.320]  that's fascism. It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government. This film
[3:31:42.320 --> 3:31:49.440]  documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda. Get your copy

[3:31:57.000 --> 3:32:02.600]  The Obama deception. The people strike back.
[3:32:02.600 --> 3:32:07.480]  You are a rebel, admit it. You refuse to read the directions when assembling a new item.
[3:32:07.480 --> 3:32:11.640]  You won't ask for directions when you're lost. Once in a while, you drive in the carpool
[3:32:11.640 --> 3:32:16.520]  lane with only you in the car. Your neighbors call you a crackpot, and you can count your
[3:32:16.520 --> 3:32:21.640]  real friends on one hand. Well, join the club. Einstein failed math, quit school, and his
[3:32:21.640 --> 3:32:26.520]  rebel ideas led to some of the world's most amazing discoveries. Edison rebelled against
[3:32:26.520 --> 3:32:30.960]  the dark, failed over a thousand times, then invented the light bulb. George Washington
[3:32:30.960 --> 3:32:36.040]  rebelled against an entire country and led the creation of a new one. Now, Alex Jones
[3:32:36.040 --> 3:32:40.880]  is working to save that very country. So go ahead, be a rebel. Put in a food supply from

[3:33:29.440 --> 3:33:42.480]  the chief blood knows, they point the cannon at you. God didn't aim me, didn't aim me
[3:33:42.480 --> 3:33:51.480]  though, I ain't no senator, son. It didn't aim me, didn't aim me, didn't aim me.
[3:33:51.480 --> 3:33:58.880]  Man, in life amazing, from this planet spinning through the dark void of space. I'm sitting
[3:33:58.880 --> 3:34:07.200]  there talking to Raleigh James. I'm in Austin, Texas. The people listening all over the world.
[3:34:07.200 --> 3:34:12.600]  The establishment doesn't like this. They call the internet the World Wide Wiretap.
[3:34:12.600 --> 3:34:16.120]  They want to build the grid, get us used to using it, get us addicted, just like YouTube
[3:34:16.120 --> 3:34:22.200]  is a microcosm. Then take the freedom away, kick us off, and then that's the whole system.
[3:34:22.200 --> 3:34:26.760]  And that's basically what's happening. Your calls are coming up here in just a few minutes.
[3:34:26.760 --> 3:34:31.960]  There's so much going on. I shouldn't just be throwing out the questions here. What are
[3:34:31.960 --> 3:34:35.800]  some other subjects you think are important to get into? And then that said, before we
[3:34:35.800 --> 3:34:42.280]  get into that, I think they've really miscalculated with these reports coming out, saying the
[3:34:42.280 --> 3:34:46.160]  troops are the number one threat, gun owners are threats, people buying ammo are basically
[3:34:46.160 --> 3:34:50.960]  terrorist, pro-livers are basically terrorist, people against open borders are basically
[3:34:50.960 --> 3:34:57.440]  terrorist. I mean, the secret police are really getting exposed right now.
[3:34:57.440 --> 3:35:01.160]  They are, but it's a great indoctrination tool because they'll backpedal from this.
[3:35:01.160 --> 3:35:04.480]  In other words, put the worst possible spin on it. Oh, no, no, but that's not what we
[3:35:04.480 --> 3:35:09.160]  mean. Now, here's why we're saying this. And the other day when I heard the comment
[3:35:09.160 --> 3:35:15.520]  about, well, we have to look at the military because look at Timothy McVeigh, and I thought
[3:35:15.520 --> 3:35:21.000]  to myself, well, let's take that logic now and let's just consistently expand it and say,
[3:35:21.000 --> 3:35:25.040]  well, if we're looking at the military because of Timothy McVeigh, then we've got to look
[3:35:25.040 --> 3:35:30.360]  at the federal central government because of Adolf Hitler. So, you know, the reality,
[3:35:30.360 --> 3:35:36.440]  though, is that they will give you, you know, the worst shock. And then when they peddle
[3:35:36.440 --> 3:35:40.880]  back, people say, oh, see, it's not that bad. That's really what's happening. So I'm not
[3:35:40.880 --> 3:35:41.880]  sure they miscalculated.
[3:35:41.880 --> 3:35:45.760]  You think they may have been leaking some of these on purpose?
[3:35:45.760 --> 3:35:50.800]  Well, I think it's very possible. And, you know, when we talk about it, you asked what's
[3:35:50.800 --> 3:35:56.600]  on my mind, and everybody talks about globalism, and they think about it as if it's an international
[3:35:56.600 --> 3:36:02.240]  thing. It's not, it's a supernational thing. There is a control level in globalism that
[3:36:02.240 --> 3:36:07.080]  makes the control level in our country look tame. But not only that, some of the documents
[3:36:07.080 --> 3:36:11.840]  I had sent you about the Bank of International Settlement, there's a lot more in this base
[3:36:11.840 --> 3:36:12.840]  as well.
[3:36:12.840 --> 3:36:18.560]  And what's fascinating is when everybody jumped on Obama's statement, everybody in terms
[3:36:18.560 --> 3:36:24.400]  of like you and I and people who were awake when it looked like, and it is, that he will
[3:36:24.400 --> 3:36:30.760]  go after compensation practices. Everybody thought, oh, my God, well, that's right out
[3:36:30.760 --> 3:36:36.600]  of phase two. There's three pillars. And the first one, of course, was the capital requirements,
[3:36:36.600 --> 3:36:42.720]  which is the way that they've decimated banking worldwide. But the next one, pillar two,
[3:36:42.720 --> 3:36:49.760]  is supervisory oversight. And right out of their documents, they talk about, in fact,
[3:36:49.760 --> 3:36:55.800]  including compensation practices as things that they need for worldwide, firm-wide governance
[3:36:55.800 --> 3:36:56.800]  and management.
[3:36:56.800 --> 3:37:00.600]  Yeah, yeah. And for folks that are hearing these technical terms and not getting it,
[3:37:00.600 --> 3:37:03.400]  I'm not saying dumb it down, because most of our audience knows more than we do, but
[3:37:03.400 --> 3:37:06.720]  for those that don't understand, they're openly announcing a new global bank of the
[3:37:06.720 --> 3:37:11.960]  world to fix the banking system when they created the fiat mess to begin with, and they're
[3:37:11.960 --> 3:37:16.840]  going to have global taxes, global regulations, global control, set the currency, set the
[3:37:16.840 --> 3:37:20.000]  interest rates, and they're openly announcing this. Please continue.
[3:37:20.000 --> 3:37:24.560]  Yeah, yeah, they are. And of course, for people who don't know what the Bank of International
[3:37:24.560 --> 3:37:30.760]  Settlements is, it's the Federal Reserve and all the central bank bank. This is the place
[3:37:30.760 --> 3:37:34.840]  where they go. And the reason we call it the Basel Accordes is it's all coming out of
[3:37:34.840 --> 3:37:40.640]  Basel, Switzerland. And Basel, too, was implemented in steps. It actually goes back to 1999.
[3:37:40.640 --> 3:37:46.640]  It was accepted by our Federal Reserve and everybody else in 2005, and it dictates how
[3:37:46.640 --> 3:37:51.320]  they will operate. And the fascinating thing is many of the things that are most shocking,
[3:37:51.320 --> 3:37:56.560]  coming out of Obama's mouth, aren't coming from him. They're coming from Switzerland
[3:37:56.560 --> 3:37:59.760]  and they're coming from, again, what's not international, but super-national.
[3:37:59.760 --> 3:38:03.840]  Yeah, that's right. So this isn't all the countries working together. This is a global
[3:38:03.840 --> 3:38:09.040]  corporate web over the earth telling all the countries what to do. It's not the countries
[3:38:09.040 --> 3:38:14.080]  together deciding what's going to be done. It's this web telling all of us what to do.
[3:38:14.080 --> 3:38:18.560]  So none of the direction or will of the people is being manifest in that for all the liberals
[3:38:18.560 --> 3:38:23.040]  that say, oh, and it's the next phase, like Star Trek, one big world. I don't have that
[3:38:23.040 --> 3:38:26.960]  document in front of me because it's back there in the office and from the International
[3:38:26.960 --> 3:38:30.440]  Bank of Settlements. Do you have that? I know it's up at Raleigh.net. For those that don't
[3:38:30.440 --> 3:38:34.440]  know, I mean, they say right there in their own technical language that they're going
[3:38:34.440 --> 3:38:39.960]  to be imploding things 2008, 2009 to bring in the next phase. There is the proof and
[3:38:39.960 --> 3:38:43.320]  yet another document where they're engineering this.
[3:38:43.320 --> 3:38:49.640]  Yeah, I'm looking for that because I've got probably 100 pages of this, but what you
[3:38:49.640 --> 3:38:56.400]  were really talking about is the fact that what Basal 2 did and they have it right in
[3:38:56.400 --> 3:39:02.600]  their documents is that they allowed banks to dictate their own capital requirements
[3:39:02.600 --> 3:39:07.520]  and they set this up and what they pretty much had said was that everything would hit
[3:39:07.520 --> 3:39:14.000]  the fan by 2009 when this was implemented. But that's just the tip of the iceberg, Alex.
[3:39:14.000 --> 3:39:18.600]  I need to send you more documents to say the least because, again, what we're looking
[3:39:18.600 --> 3:39:23.960]  at here is at first the capital requirements, which is what we talked about on the air the
[3:39:23.960 --> 3:39:30.480]  other night, but Pillar 2 is the supervisory oversight and this is where we're going to
[3:39:30.480 --> 3:39:38.200]  see them call the shots for how our private CEOs are compensated and then when you get
[3:39:38.200 --> 3:39:43.960]  to Pillar 3, if Pillar 2 is the law enforcer, Pillar 3 will be the handcuffs. That's when
[3:39:43.960 --> 3:39:46.440]  they've got the total control.
[3:39:46.440 --> 3:39:50.720]  And then they've already in 2000 had a global summit in Australia with the UN where most
[3:39:50.720 --> 3:39:54.800]  of the nations on the planet, all the big western ones signed on for global standardization
[3:39:54.800 --> 3:40:01.840]  for world ID and that's really what was adopted years later in the real ID in the US and England
[3:40:01.840 --> 3:40:07.440]  and Australia and everywhere else. We already have a global standardized system being forced
[3:40:07.440 --> 3:40:12.600]  in. So right when we hear there's really a national ID card, no, it's really a world
[3:40:12.600 --> 3:40:16.720]  ID grid and the way they announced it is, oh, you get thumbprinted when you go to England
[3:40:16.720 --> 3:40:21.800]  or Germany now and foreigners get thumbprinted here too with a digital biometric. It's all
[3:40:21.800 --> 3:40:22.800]  the same.
[3:40:22.800 --> 3:40:27.520]  Oh, sure it is. And, you know, people who think that, well, I'm aware of that. I'm aware
[3:40:27.520 --> 3:40:33.480]  of the IMF. Well, the IMF is secondary to Basel to say the least. And so just like when
[3:40:33.480 --> 3:40:38.520]  you talk about the Council of Foreign Relations, 3,000 members, yeah, well, 2,990 don't know
[3:40:38.520 --> 3:40:42.680]  exactly what's going on. And it's the same thing here. But the interesting thing, and
[3:40:42.680 --> 3:40:46.160]  you've probably heard this on the news too, is that now Bernanke says they're going to
[3:40:46.160 --> 3:40:51.680]  release our stress tests on our bank. And of course, stress tests come right out of
[3:40:51.680 --> 3:40:55.240]  the IMF, which, of course, is dictated by the BIS, the Bank of India.
[3:40:55.240 --> 3:41:00.040]  Yeah, that means your country is under receivership when this is happening. They set it up, they
[3:41:00.040 --> 3:41:03.720]  give you the money, they set the Ponzi scheme, and then they come in and say, what you must
[3:41:03.720 --> 3:41:07.720]  do with your industry, is your roads, you must hand this to that corporation, to that.
[3:41:07.720 --> 3:41:09.760]  This is literally the looting now.
[3:41:09.760 --> 3:41:14.320]  Right, right. And when we talk about, as you were mentioning, carbon taxes or energy taxes,
[3:41:14.320 --> 3:41:19.560]  consumption taxes, these are right out of IMF documents. And of course, that comes,
[3:41:19.560 --> 3:41:25.160]  you go back further and you say, oh, it comes right out of Basil. So it's a couple of step
[3:41:25.160 --> 3:41:31.000]  situation. But the thing that you were alluding to earlier, this IMF document, because every
[3:41:31.000 --> 3:41:36.760]  couple of years they have these consultations. Well, in 2006, the Article 4 consultation
[3:41:36.760 --> 3:41:39.160]  on page 13, and this again is 2006.
[3:41:39.160 --> 3:41:42.680]  Yeah, say that slowly, because I'm going to have my guys do a story on this. I mean,
[3:41:42.680 --> 3:41:46.280]  there's so many of these. I've seen many other similar, but here's just another one, where
[3:41:46.280 --> 3:41:50.480]  you see all the premeditation. And right at this time, we're at Bilderberg, where they've
[3:41:50.480 --> 3:41:56.040]  made the decision, we get the intel from the actual heads of all the major pyramid structures,
[3:41:56.040 --> 3:42:00.160]  which are going to compartmentalize, but they all nexus in to meet and do iron things out
[3:42:00.160 --> 3:42:04.120]  at many meetings like Bilderberg. They were already planning it. Then we came out and
[3:42:04.120 --> 3:42:07.680]  announced what was going to happen. It did happen. But yeah, give, this is very important.
[3:42:07.680 --> 3:42:14.720]  I'll give folks where they can get this. Okay. It's the IMF United States, 2006, Article
[3:42:14.720 --> 3:42:21.880]  4 consultation, staff report, page 13. And again, the IMF in this report, they're not
[3:42:21.880 --> 3:42:27.720]  creating this. They're reporting on what is in the Basel II documents. And you can read
[3:42:27.720 --> 3:42:34.000]  the entire Basel II Accord. It's 284 pages, but you can read it. The original ideation
[3:42:34.000 --> 3:42:39.840]  was in 1999, and it was approved, as I say, in November of 2005 by the member banks. And
[3:42:39.840 --> 3:42:42.960]  of course, the member banks includes the federal reserve. So here's the article.
[3:42:42.960 --> 3:42:48.680]  Or I could just laugh at you that's done research and say, world banks don't exist in Giggle,
[3:42:48.680 --> 3:42:51.920]  and then I could go watch the Cowboys and listen to Britney Spears.
[3:42:51.920 --> 3:42:56.640]  Well, exactly. And you see, that's the way they'll do it. When we talk about one world
[3:42:56.640 --> 3:43:00.680]  currency, they can still call it the dollar or the yen or the euro. They can still have
[3:43:00.680 --> 3:43:01.680]  whatever premeditated.
[3:43:01.680 --> 3:43:05.360]  And the international level, though, it's standardized. They control it. Read over that
[3:43:05.360 --> 3:43:06.360]  for folks.
[3:43:06.360 --> 3:43:12.920]  Well, exactly. So we're, again, talking, here's the IMF in 2006, and they're referring
[3:43:12.920 --> 3:43:18.480]  back to what Basel is doing and what they're saying, Basel II. Bank regulators expected
[3:43:18.480 --> 3:43:25.400]  some decline and minimum capital requirements after the ship to Basel II norms in 2009. Acknowledge
[3:43:25.400 --> 3:43:29.440]  that the impact on bank balance sheets is uncertain, in part because the role of the
[3:43:29.440 --> 3:43:34.880]  economic cycle would only become fully evident after the system was implemented. However,
[3:43:34.880 --> 3:43:35.880]  capital...
[3:43:35.880 --> 3:43:40.360]  Let's stop. Let's stop. Let's stop. See, they're changing capital requirements, and then leading
[3:43:40.360 --> 3:43:46.320]  up to 2009, they have to then gauge how bad this hurts us as they consolidate. It's all
[3:43:46.320 --> 3:43:51.640]  written lawyer speak, and that they would know in 2009, and now they do know gauging
[3:43:51.640 --> 3:43:57.080]  their attack profile, their computer models, now they're fine tuning with these G20 meetings.
[3:43:57.080 --> 3:43:58.080]  Please continue.
[3:43:58.080 --> 3:44:03.480]  Right, and they're saying capital adequacy standards could be recalibrated if necessary
[3:44:03.480 --> 3:44:08.320]  as the transition to the new framework will take place over several years. And so what
[3:44:08.320 --> 3:44:11.880]  they're really saying, again, is what we're saying about incrementalism. Well, we know
[3:44:11.880 --> 3:44:16.480]  in 2009 it's going to hit the fan, therefore we'll need to recalibrate it. And when you
[3:44:16.480 --> 3:44:21.520]  look at it and you say, this is 2006, yeah, but when you look at where they got it, this
[3:44:21.520 --> 3:44:23.480]  started in 99.
[3:44:23.480 --> 3:44:31.120]  Amazing. And so they're 10, 12 years ahead of this over and over and over again, 10
[3:44:31.120 --> 3:44:35.080]  years from this date, but 12 years out from completion. And people will say, where's the
[3:44:35.080 --> 3:44:40.720]  world government when they're already issuing the new quantitative easing, their new supercurrency
[3:44:40.720 --> 3:44:46.520]  at bank to bank level backed up with our tax money. My God, Raleigh, how do we get the
[3:44:46.520 --> 3:44:50.200]  general public to understand this and realize this? Because the average good old boy making
[3:44:50.200 --> 3:44:54.600]  200 grand a year, he thinks he's part of the power elite because he goes to a once a year
[3:44:54.600 --> 3:45:00.440]  luncheon with the governor. And so he psychologically thinks he's with the big boys and he's going
[3:45:00.440 --> 3:45:03.520]  to go right down the tubes the whole time thinking we're his enemy.
[3:45:03.520 --> 3:45:08.800]  Well, a lot of people are smug thinking, well, that's all right. For instance, I'm just in
[3:45:08.800 --> 3:45:14.360]  gold. And what they're going to realize is that this control is complete. For instance,
[3:45:14.360 --> 3:45:18.600]  we look at gold prices and all of us were saying gold should have been up past $2,000
[3:45:18.600 --> 3:45:23.720]  a month by now. And we know something's going on. Well, something is going on. And that
[3:45:23.720 --> 3:45:29.000]  is that gold is being bought much like the mortgage securities were. And this is also
[3:45:29.000 --> 3:45:34.800]  by nations as well as financial entities, the Deutsche Bank, for instance. We're looking
[3:45:34.800 --> 3:45:40.080]  at not only people buying fractional shares of gold, which everybody knows about the ETFs,
[3:45:40.080 --> 3:45:44.140]  of course. And that's an issue right there in terms of how much ETF versus how much
[3:45:44.140 --> 3:45:50.760]  gold comics has. But you get beyond the ETF and you start to get into the ETN and this
[3:45:50.760 --> 3:45:57.200]  is a gold derivative. The ETN or exchange traded notes, they are unsecured debt obligations
[3:45:57.200 --> 3:46:03.760]  and they are in the absolute billions. And of course, the entities that sell them, they
[3:46:03.760 --> 3:46:08.200]  don't want gold to go up. So people who think they have a way out, these are the people
[3:46:08.200 --> 3:46:12.400]  that I'd like to awaken first because they know something's up. They're not completely
[3:46:12.400 --> 3:46:17.240]  still asleep, but they think that there's a way around this. There is no way around
[3:46:17.240 --> 3:46:21.480]  this but through it. And again, as I mentioned earlier with that statement, which in one
[3:46:21.480 --> 3:46:27.400]  way is hopeful in terms of we might have to adjust capital requirements and things of
[3:46:27.400 --> 3:46:32.360]  this nature, they want to continue to do it incrementally. Now, in terms of how you wake
[3:46:32.360 --> 3:46:37.440]  them up, Alex, you know better than anyone else because the thing about your films is
[3:46:37.440 --> 3:46:42.120]  there is an entertainment component as well. Not saying you're doing a soft shoe, but the
[3:46:42.120 --> 3:46:47.640]  idea that you're presenting it in an entertaining and compelling manner. If I were to read,
[3:46:47.640 --> 3:46:52.160]  you know, let alone the basal too, if I were just to read an IMF Accord, people would be
[3:46:52.160 --> 3:46:58.200]  asleep by the third page if they weren't by the third sentence. So it is, it must be done
[3:46:58.200 --> 3:47:03.280]  in a way that it's entertaining and also in a way that it's relatable. So people understand
[3:47:03.280 --> 3:47:08.040]  like we were saying about the internet, for instance, it's the same exact deal here. Frame
[3:47:08.040 --> 3:47:13.160]  it as free market or frame it as a trade agreement. Exactly. Well, let me take the establishment.
[3:47:13.160 --> 3:47:17.440]  They do everything that they do. Very boring, very dry. But if you know the lawyer language,
[3:47:17.440 --> 3:47:21.840]  it's horrifying to read what they're saying, but they say it to calm you. It's no big deal.
[3:47:21.840 --> 3:47:26.320]  It's some dirty old gray paper. Don't look at it. Don't, you know, never mind that sports
[3:47:26.320 --> 3:47:30.560]  stadium. Never mind that FEMA camp. Never mind this or that. Never mind these bills.
[3:47:30.560 --> 3:47:34.840]  Everything's fine. You know, they speak to our laziness, but we're designed to be like
[3:47:34.840 --> 3:47:39.280]  humans where a saber-toothed cat comes running up to us and it's got big fangs and it's growling.
[3:47:39.280 --> 3:47:44.000]  So that's what gets us moving. And so when I show my film and play ominous music, when
[3:47:44.000 --> 3:47:50.200]  I show some bill just to say ban guns, well, it is ominous. So, you know, that's how we
[3:47:50.200 --> 3:47:54.200]  take things in. I'm going to put the spooky music in there. That's what they do. They
[3:47:54.200 --> 3:47:58.920]  always criticize me for that. That's what they do. But I take the truth and then put
[3:47:58.920 --> 3:48:03.760]  it with the music or the images I think, you know, fit with it. They take their lives and
[3:48:03.760 --> 3:48:08.320]  then they'll take something horrible and put happy music on it to sell the horrible. I'll
[3:48:08.320 --> 3:48:13.200]  take something horrible and put horrible music on it. Do you see what I'm saying?
[3:48:13.200 --> 3:48:16.840]  And that's exactly what you have to do because if you don't have that, what some people will
[3:48:16.840 --> 3:48:21.520]  criticize you for, the glitz and the glamour. If you don't have that, you're going to lose
[3:48:21.520 --> 3:48:25.120]  the people you're trying to awaken because it's in multi-steps. Again, first you awaken
[3:48:25.120 --> 3:48:30.080]  them and then they'll go into, well, there's a workaround for me because everybody believes
[3:48:30.080 --> 3:48:34.080]  that it won't happen to them. And as they start to see that there's a workaround for
[3:48:34.080 --> 3:48:38.840]  nobody, that's when they start to realize that's why I brought up gold a minute ago.
[3:48:38.840 --> 3:48:44.200]  You know, even without looking at the derivatives, if you just look at the fractional shares,
[3:48:44.200 --> 3:48:48.600]  right now the comics is trading about 32 million ounces of gold. They only have 8.5 million
[3:48:48.600 --> 3:48:54.760]  back in it. And again, we're not even getting to those true derivatives here. So, anybody
[3:48:54.760 --> 3:49:00.360]  who thinks, well, I've got my cave and I've got my victory garden and, you know, think
[3:49:00.360 --> 3:49:01.360]  again.
[3:49:01.360 --> 3:49:05.720]  And they're not getting rid, absolutely. They're not getting rid of derivatives because that's
[3:49:05.720 --> 3:49:10.800]  the big fiat weapon they use to manipulate stock markets take over governments. It's
[3:49:10.800 --> 3:49:17.560]  the tsunami of liquid made-up fiat currency that everybody accepts because the scammers
[3:49:17.560 --> 3:49:20.840]  run the governments that they're using to buy up the world.
[3:49:20.840 --> 3:49:27.240]  Well, sure. In the fourth annual BIS conference, one of the things that came out of it was
[3:49:27.240 --> 3:49:32.280]  that they wanted to influence asset prices. William White from the BIS, when he was talking
[3:49:32.280 --> 3:49:36.600]  about the central bank cooperation, which of course is central bank takeover.
[3:49:36.600 --> 3:49:37.600]  Yeah, right.
[3:49:37.600 --> 3:49:43.000]  Right, of course. In his fourth plank was saying the efficient international dissemination
[3:49:43.000 --> 3:49:48.800]  of ideas and information that improves national policymaking is a factor, but at last the
[3:49:48.800 --> 3:49:54.320]  provision of international credits and joint efforts to influence asset prices, especially
[3:49:54.320 --> 3:49:59.640]  gold and foreign exchange, in circumstances where this might be thought useful is the
[3:49:59.640 --> 3:50:00.640]  key.
[3:50:00.640 --> 3:50:07.800]  Oh, it's sickening. Well, all of their lipstick on the pig, as they say, all of that is not
[3:50:07.800 --> 3:50:12.320]  working anymore because reality's setting into people. And the globalist, as you know,
[3:50:12.320 --> 3:50:15.560]  Raleigh, but some people may not know this out there, bragged that they're bringing
[3:50:15.560 --> 3:50:19.640]  the economy down by design because we're living too well and the free market's not good. These
[3:50:19.640 --> 3:50:23.760]  big bankers admit they're monopoly men. They don't want free market. They love communism,
[3:50:23.760 --> 3:50:29.320]  socialism, fascism. And so that's what the public to know. This is all by design. And
[3:50:29.320 --> 3:50:34.040]  a lot of, but in a way, we deserve it. I mean, we've been fat, dumb, and happy, Raleigh.
[3:50:34.040 --> 3:50:36.080]  And so what do you expect?
[3:50:36.080 --> 3:50:42.760]  Agreed. In fact, what people need to understand is that many people think that this is Kumbaya
[3:50:42.760 --> 3:50:47.680]  cooperation. This is not cooperation. This is control on a level that people have never
[3:50:47.680 --> 3:50:48.680]  seen before.
[3:50:48.680 --> 3:50:54.680]  It's a bunch of rich fat cats running scams, teaming up together and literally like a gang
[3:50:54.680 --> 3:50:58.760]  beating the daylights out of us if we're lucky. Raleigh James will take a few calls in the
[3:50:58.760 --> 3:51:02.000]  final segment straight ahead. Raleigh.net.
[3:51:02.000 --> 3:51:06.800]  Attention, gardeners. This is an urgent GCN self-reliance update. GCN has just discovered
[3:51:06.800 --> 3:51:11.160]  a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers, and herbs. It's called Proto-Gro and
[3:51:11.160 --> 3:51:14.840]  it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants
[3:51:14.840 --> 3:51:19.120]  to grow like crazy under practically any soil and like conditions. Now, here's the best
[3:51:19.120 --> 3:51:23.520]  part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance. Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients
[3:51:23.520 --> 3:51:28.200]  maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in
[3:51:28.200 --> 3:51:29.200]  minimum time.
[3:51:29.200 --> 3:51:32.680]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys, which have the capacity to actually unlock
[3:51:32.680 --> 3:51:36.620]  the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants. Proto-Gro's full spectrum plant fertility
[3:51:36.620 --> 3:51:40.800]  means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[3:51:40.800 --> 3:51:44.520]  If you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can. If you want
[3:51:44.520 --> 3:51:49.040]  to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy. GCN listeners who want to grow
[3:51:49.040 --> 3:51:55.400]  dirt-cheaf superfoods should visit the Proto-Gro website at growlikecrazy.com. That's www.growlikecrazy.com

[3:52:02.440 --> 3:52:08.560]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear. We've
[3:52:08.560 --> 3:52:13.280]  got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would
[3:52:13.280 --> 3:52:14.360]  like to see.
[3:52:14.360 --> 3:52:19.520]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interests
[3:52:19.520 --> 3:52:20.920]  of the American people.
[3:52:20.920 --> 3:52:25.280]  While Obama's already fudging, yeah, fudged since day one in this election.
[3:52:25.280 --> 3:52:30.360]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[3:52:30.360 --> 3:52:38.400]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[3:52:38.400 --> 3:52:43.280]  It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government. This film documents
[3:52:43.280 --> 3:52:49.880]  who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda. Get your copy of the
[3:52:49.880 --> 3:52:57.200]  Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:52:57.200 --> 3:53:01.640]  The Obama deception. The people strike back.
[3:53:01.640 --> 3:53:06.720]  Would you give someone $100 for a $10 bill if you're taking vitamins and minerals in
[3:53:06.720 --> 3:53:09.440]  a pill form? That's exactly what you're doing.
[3:53:09.440 --> 3:53:14.960]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman. According to the physician's desk reference, many vitamins
[3:53:14.960 --> 3:53:20.040]  and minerals in a pill form are 10% absorbed. It doesn't take a mathematician to figure
[3:53:20.040 --> 3:53:25.960]  out for every $100 you spend on these pills, you're flushing $90 down the toilet.
[3:53:25.960 --> 3:53:30.240]  Start absorbing the nutrients you swallow. Introducing chews for health, a delicious

[3:54:13.040 --> 3:54:26.200]  I wish your buck was still silver. It was back when the country was wrong. Back before
[3:54:26.200 --> 3:54:27.200]  else.
[3:54:27.200 --> 3:54:30.800]  Let's take a few calls from Raleigh James. Can I talk to you, host? I thought I had you
[3:54:30.800 --> 3:54:34.920]  back more than once or twice a year. It's always great. Margaret in British Columbia,
[3:54:34.920 --> 3:54:36.400]  you're on the air. Go ahead.
[3:54:36.400 --> 3:54:43.840]  Hey, Alex. Thanks. This is a great show. I didn't listen to your radio until about
[3:54:43.840 --> 3:54:49.280]  six months ago, and I totally agree with your guess. You get blown away. I didn't know of
[3:54:49.280 --> 3:54:56.760]  the BIS and CFR. Information is power. About three weeks ago, I live on a little island
[3:54:56.760 --> 3:55:03.120]  here in BC, and I couldn't believe that a lot of the information, but about three weeks
[3:55:03.120 --> 3:55:14.080]  ago, the RCMP here were coming to do, well, they said they were going to be doing security
[3:55:14.080 --> 3:55:16.320]  for Whistler, which they will be for the Olympics.
[3:55:16.320 --> 3:55:17.320]  That's the federal police.
[3:55:17.320 --> 3:55:18.320]  That's right.
[3:55:18.320 --> 3:55:23.800]  And now they have their regular army patrolling the streets of Canada, just like here.
[3:55:23.800 --> 3:55:30.280]  Well, and at the same time, I found out that our government has allowed the U.S. to command
[3:55:30.280 --> 3:55:35.440]  23 kilometers as a border patrol thing, but in the meantime, they were coming over. We're
[3:55:35.440 --> 3:55:41.440]  a small island, about 1,000 population. And so everybody, the BNBs and the restaurants
[3:55:41.440 --> 3:55:46.440]  all hear about it. But I was really surprised because the second day that they were here,
[3:55:46.440 --> 3:55:53.040]  the U.S. military showed up. So I don't know. It'll be soon when they'll be checking us
[3:55:53.040 --> 3:55:54.040]  at our roadblocks.
[3:55:54.040 --> 3:55:58.840]  No, I hear you and I appreciate your call. No, no. They signed deals over the last decade,
[3:55:58.840 --> 3:56:03.240]  a big one last year, and Congress said we weren't informed. And Raleigh, it's really
[3:56:03.240 --> 3:56:08.040]  happening to use Mexican and Canadian troops here and our troops there, and they're open
[3:56:08.040 --> 3:56:10.320]  North Combs now in Canada.
[3:56:10.320 --> 3:56:16.200]  Absolutely. And when the Canadians heard about it, some of them went crazy as well. These
[3:56:16.200 --> 3:56:21.800]  were signed without any knowledge of the general public, and sure it's going that way. But
[3:56:21.800 --> 3:56:26.720]  unfortunately, you know, BC is a real great laboratory for this because there is a carbon
[3:56:26.720 --> 3:56:32.280]  tax, and you have things like the Vancouver Sun backing up everything that is global
[3:56:32.280 --> 3:56:36.800]  or social, and you're starting to see like the woman who called a disconnect, and that's
[3:56:36.800 --> 3:56:38.480]  very healthy.
[3:56:38.480 --> 3:56:43.400]  But I mean, the globalists have been denying world government. Now they're kind of admitting
[3:56:43.400 --> 3:56:47.640]  a little bit, but so much is still hidden. We see it because we study it. What's going
[3:56:47.640 --> 3:56:51.040]  to happen when they try to come right out with all of it? They're already kind of going,
[3:56:51.040 --> 3:56:55.280]  more than one child is bad for the carbon footprint, and we may have to watch your neighbors
[3:56:55.280 --> 3:56:58.960]  and you, and we may have to. But I mean, what's going to happen when they kind of unveil even
[3:56:58.960 --> 3:57:02.760]  more of the public's already this mad? What's going to happen when they find out this is
[3:57:02.760 --> 3:57:06.760]  real tyranny? This isn't just some boss hog corruption.
[3:57:06.760 --> 3:57:11.240]  Well, in terms of that, if you're thinking, well, people will awaken to the point that
[3:57:11.240 --> 3:57:16.360]  they will want to overthrow the government to some degree, that is the dream of those
[3:57:16.360 --> 3:57:20.400]  who want to control us because the early stages of that would be martial law and would be
[3:57:20.400 --> 3:57:22.400]  that bootstrap and would be as an example.
[3:57:22.400 --> 3:57:25.760]  So what is the last minute, Raleigh? And then we're out of time, and I'll be back this
[3:57:25.760 --> 3:57:29.960]  Sunday, folks, four to six p.m. central, and you'll be on the night, nine to midnight
[3:57:29.960 --> 3:57:35.440]  on XM stations. Raleigh, what is the solution in one minute?
[3:57:35.440 --> 3:57:38.960]  Awakening and being involved, exactly what you're doing one person at a time. I wish
[3:57:38.960 --> 3:57:43.160]  it was sexy. I wish there was a way to do it another way. People want this great key
[3:57:43.160 --> 3:57:47.800]  and this great answer, but it's information and it is starting to understand, be aware,
[3:57:47.800 --> 3:57:50.960]  believe, and telling the guy next to you one person at a time, and that's what your
[3:57:50.960 --> 3:57:52.920]  movies do very well.
[3:57:52.920 --> 3:57:57.640]  And saying no. I agree with you. I mean, people keep looking for some magic silver bullet.
[3:57:57.640 --> 3:58:01.720]  It's saying no. I mean, police, military. Are you going to follow these illegal orders?
[3:58:01.720 --> 3:58:04.120]  Obama says it's okay to torture if it's an order.
[3:58:04.120 --> 3:58:07.800]  Right, but it's got to get to that head count where it's the sweet point. You and I say
[3:58:07.800 --> 3:58:11.360]  no, we're nuts. Ten million people say no, they're a force.
[3:58:11.360 --> 3:58:14.800]  I think we're getting there. That's why the neo-cons are trying to co-opt the Tea Party
[3:58:14.800 --> 3:58:20.240]  movement. Raleigh James, ladies and gentlemen, Raleigh, R-O-L-L-Y-E dot net, up on screen
[3:58:20.240 --> 3:58:26.120]  for presidentplanet.tv. Viewers, retransmission starts now with it. I went into torture.

[3:58:30.760 --> 3:58:34.840]  continue listening. God bless you, Raleigh. Good having you on.
[3:58:34.840 --> 3:58:35.840]  And an honor and a pleasure. Thanks.
[3:58:35.840 --> 3:58:39.400]  It's always an honor to have you on. Thanks for all your help and research. That's a great
[3:58:39.400 --> 3:58:42.400]  talk show, super informed. There's not many like it.

[3:58:51.920 --> 3:58:55.600]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones. I've told you for a long time it's important to be
[3:58:55.600 --> 3:58:59.840]  self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever. We need to be independent and food
[3:58:59.840 --> 3:59:03.520]  and water is the key. You'll never have to stand in a bread line until you have your
[3:59:03.520 --> 3:59:07.360]  own bread. You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of
[3:59:07.360 --> 3:59:11.360]  your family in any emergency if you simply prepare. No one is going to take care of your
