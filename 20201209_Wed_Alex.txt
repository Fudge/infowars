[00:00.000 --> 00:29.000]  The Matrix is a system, Neil. That system is our enemy. When you're inside, you look around. What do you see? Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters.
[00:29.000 --> 00:38.000]  Carpenters. The very minds of the people we are trying to save. But until we do, these people are still apart from that system and that makes them our enemy.
[00:38.000 --> 00:50.000]  We have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so inert, so hopelessly dependent on the system that they will fight to protect it.
[00:50.000 --> 01:05.000]  Anybody who believes things that they know aren't true, but they'll fight for them. You know people that know that the things they believe aren't true, but yet they'll get angry at you and fight for them? There's a weirdness to them.
[01:05.000 --> 01:11.000]  The Matrix is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.
[01:11.000 --> 01:15.000]  What truth?
[01:15.000 --> 01:21.000]  They're watching you, Neil.
[01:21.000 --> 01:32.000]  Human beings are a disease. You are a cancer of this planet. And we are the cure.
[01:32.000 --> 01:37.000]  Get me the hell out of here!
[01:37.000 --> 01:43.000]  Welcome to the real world.
[01:43.000 --> 01:49.000]  This program contains language and sequences some viewers may find disturbing.
[01:49.000 --> 01:57.000]  The nation and all of our freedoms hang by a thread. And the military apparatus of this country is about to be handed over to SCUM.
[01:57.000 --> 02:13.000]  And the Russian SCUM.
[02:13.000 --> 02:28.000]  And the same incredible terror that's menacing me will strike at you!
[02:28.000 --> 02:43.000]  They're coming! Help! Help! They're coming! They're coming! Listen to me! Listen to me! Please! Your necks are in danger! Please listen to me! It's something terrible!
[02:43.000 --> 02:50.000]  Your necks, here they are! They're already here! Help! Your necks! They're coming! They're coming!
[02:50.000 --> 02:58.000]  Sleep. The seed is planted. Sleep. Terror grows.
[02:58.000 --> 03:02.000]  Elizabeth, wake up! Get you when you sleep! Sit up!
[03:02.000 --> 03:06.000]  Invasion of the body snatchers.
[03:06.000 --> 03:10.000]  All of a sudden they're growing like parasites. Is it contagious?
[03:10.000 --> 03:14.000]  It's real homies. It looked right at me. Your necks are dead out.
[03:14.000 --> 03:24.000]  Elizabeth was human, it was not human. Now, the classic fear begins to grow. We're being cornered.
[03:24.000 --> 03:29.000]  In a modern masterpiece of science fiction. Ibarricating the street.
[03:29.000 --> 03:32.000]  Invasion of the body snatchers.
[03:32.000 --> 03:53.000]  The land of the walking dead.
[03:53.000 --> 04:10.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. It's Alex Jones.
[04:10.000 --> 04:19.000]  There is a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[04:19.000 --> 04:30.000]  Alex Jones. The faraway conspiracy theorist who was a parent.
[04:30.000 --> 04:34.000]  Alex Jones.
[04:34.000 --> 04:40.000]  Scum! Russian scum!
[04:40.000 --> 04:45.000]  Until war comes to mind.
[04:45.000 --> 04:52.000]  Reputation is amazing. I will not let you down. You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[04:52.000 --> 05:15.000]  I've got some really exciting good news, and I've also got some bad news.
[05:15.000 --> 05:24.000]  You, with your word of mouth, have overwritten that, and they are so scared of InfoWars.com, and they're so scared of you being able to communicate and share the truth.
[05:24.000 --> 05:29.000]  But, we're bringing in the same amount of money we brought in last December, right now.
[05:29.000 --> 05:32.000]  This is our most important month to be able to fund ourselves in the next year.
[05:32.000 --> 05:36.000]  And I understand the economy is shut down. I understand there's not as much money as they used to be.
[05:36.000 --> 05:39.000]  They're trying to kill Trump's recovery, but InfoWars really needs your support.
[05:39.000 --> 05:45.000]  You just buy great items through your Christmas shopping at InfoWars.com with huge sales, amazing products,
[05:45.000 --> 05:49.000]  and then you know you're funding the InfoWars and not funding Amazon and Jeff Bezos,
[05:49.000 --> 05:52.000]  and the globalists that are openly trying to destroy small businesses.
[05:52.000 --> 06:17.000]  Continue to fund the Second American Revolution while getting great products at the same time at InfoWarsstore.com. Thank you.
[06:22.000 --> 06:36.000]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome, and thank you for joining us.
[06:36.000 --> 06:41.000]  It is Wednesday, December 9th, the year is 2020. I am your host, Alex Jones.
[06:41.000 --> 06:47.000]  We're going to be here for the next four hours live ahead of the war with Owen Stroyer, right here on the InfoWars Network.
[06:47.000 --> 06:52.000]  These are very trying times, but for every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction.
[06:52.000 --> 06:58.000]  That's what Newtonian physics tell us, and that's what our own eyes and experiences show us here in the third dimension.
[06:58.000 --> 07:05.000]  And as Fox News turns against President Trump against America, we have seen an exodus away from them to Newsmax,
[07:05.000 --> 07:09.000]  an exodus to OAN, an exodus to right side, which is wonderful.
[07:09.000 --> 07:15.000]  But what's not been talked about is the exodus to InfoWars that's been the most hardcore and most over the target.
[07:15.000 --> 07:23.000]  We have gained, in the last week, I said on Monday, 30-plus new cable stations.
[07:23.000 --> 07:31.000]  Now it's over 50 cable stations, TV stations, and just radio affiliates are pouring in because folks now go,
[07:31.000 --> 07:36.000]  wow, that guy wasn't crazy, and the show gets top ratings, so put him on.
[07:36.000 --> 07:40.000]  So support local stations that were already on, radio, TV, and cable.
[07:40.000 --> 07:43.000]  Spread the word about them, become a sponsor, support their sponsors.
[07:43.000 --> 07:49.000]  That's wonderful. But if you're listening to me over the Internet or over a podcast or a video later,
[07:49.000 --> 07:56.000]  call your local TV station, your local cable station, and say, hey, Alex Jones' show, David Knight and Owen Schreuer,
[07:56.000 --> 08:01.000]  and election countdown that's ongoing that Robert Barnes is going to start co-hosting again next week with John Lorraine,
[08:01.000 --> 08:09.000]  7 to 9, it's all live and it's all free to air. The TV and cable is, because I completely control that, and I'm able to do it.
[08:09.000 --> 08:16.000]  So you can put your local commercials over all of our ads, we have all the tones, all the codes, all the fanciest stuff, all the best satellites.
[08:16.000 --> 08:24.000]  And this is where you can hook right in and just contact our affiliate folks at infowars.com forward slash affiliate.
[08:24.000 --> 08:31.000]  And the Globalist Demonization Campaign against InfoWars, I knew that their plan was going to roll out.
[08:31.000 --> 08:34.000]  I knew they were just getting rid of us first before they shut everybody else down.
[08:34.000 --> 08:40.000]  So I knew if we could hold on, we would explode on the other side and really have a shot at defeating the Globalist.
[08:40.000 --> 08:48.000]  That has now happened. Again, over 50 cable stations, some huge in just the last week.
[08:48.000 --> 08:54.000]  And again, they're happy for us to advertise them, but we do that, the left might say the hateful email or threaten something.
[08:54.000 --> 09:01.000]  So all we do is we just don't promote it. We don't list the affiliates. The left's already gotten their names, gotten their info.
[09:01.000 --> 09:08.000]  It doesn't hurt anybody. It's the mounts that roars. It's just an example of how the NFL bends over and everybody else bends over the threat of the left.
[09:08.000 --> 09:15.000]  But with traditional talk radio and then local cable and TV stations, they are giving the left a big finger.
[09:15.000 --> 09:22.000]  And I'm never really busy promoting ourselves, though I need to at this critical juncture because we're exploding so fast.
[09:22.000 --> 09:28.000]  I want to thank everybody for your support, keeping us in this position to be here at this moment of vindication.
[09:28.000 --> 09:36.000]  But we are going to get some quotes from TV stations and radio stations the next week through affiliate relations so we can quote them saying,
[09:36.000 --> 09:44.000]  we put Alex Jones on in fill in our city on one of our sub HD channels that had no ratings.
[09:44.000 --> 09:48.000]  And now it's the number one show in the city, not just our station.
[09:48.000 --> 09:54.000]  I mean, that's the stories I've got out of New York, upstate New York, out of Rochester, places like that.
[09:54.000 --> 10:07.000]  That's the reports we've got out of places like Kansas City, Missouri and Wichita, Kansas and Oklahoma City and areas of California, Minnesota.
[10:07.000 --> 10:13.000]  We just got 24 cable systems and over 10 TV stations in Minnesota this week.
[10:13.000 --> 10:18.000]  I mean, in fact, when I said 50 plus, it's actually more than that.
[10:18.000 --> 10:24.000]  This is very exciting, ladies and gentlemen, very, very exciting.
[10:24.000 --> 10:27.000]  And so let's give some more happy news here.
[10:27.000 --> 10:41.000]  Historic event history made Newsmax host Greg Kelly scores ratings win over Fox News host in first ever event.
[10:41.000 --> 10:44.000]  So that's what's happening.
[10:44.000 --> 10:51.000]  I mean, look, we've been taking off almost every box system that plugs into the Internet and quote gives you cable.
[10:51.000 --> 10:53.000]  But cloud TV is owned by Patriots.
[10:53.000 --> 10:55.000]  They put us on two years ago.
[10:55.000 --> 10:58.000]  We're number one on cloud TV.
[10:58.000 --> 11:05.000]  And if you combine all news channels together, including oan or bigger than all of them, Newsmax oan all of them together.
[11:05.000 --> 11:10.000]  And again, they're kind of shocked by that they even moved us used to we were at the top is whatever was number one they put at the top.
[11:10.000 --> 11:14.000]  They kind of move us the bottom like, well, he just he just dominates too much.
[11:14.000 --> 11:15.000]  We kind of hide his link.
[11:15.000 --> 11:17.000]  Maybe these channels will get some more viewers.
[11:17.000 --> 11:19.000]  And I'm not in competition with those folks.
[11:19.000 --> 11:20.000]  I love oan.
[11:20.000 --> 11:23.000]  I really like Newsmax.
[11:23.000 --> 11:29.000]  It's just that it's just funny because we have more viewers than all of them combined on cloud TV.
[11:29.000 --> 11:33.000]  Obviously, oan is on a bunch more cable systems and satellite systems and I love it.
[11:33.000 --> 11:36.000]  And I hope oan or Newsmax become the number one stations.
[11:36.000 --> 11:37.000]  I don't care.
[11:37.000 --> 11:42.000]  I hope somebody comes up a lot better than I am smarter than I am to turn the tide to beat the globalist.
[11:42.000 --> 11:45.000]  I'll retire next week and hang up my spurs.
[11:45.000 --> 11:48.000]  But we are number one in places like Orlando.
[11:48.000 --> 11:53.000]  They put us on a 10,000 watt station up against a 50,000 watt station with rush limbaugh.
[11:53.000 --> 11:55.000]  And within six months we were number one.
[11:55.000 --> 12:00.000]  And then they came in and leased out the station for ESPN year later.
[12:00.000 --> 12:04.000]  They dumped the contract brought us back ratings went back up.
[12:04.000 --> 12:09.000]  I mean, that's just how it works. That's something local stations and small stations do medium sized stations.
[12:09.000 --> 12:10.000]  They put me on.
[12:10.000 --> 12:12.000]  We get massive ratings for them.
[12:12.000 --> 12:15.000]  And then they're able to get ratings to lease out the station.
[12:15.000 --> 12:18.000]  So again, not about Alex Jones being successful or cool.
[12:18.000 --> 12:22.000]  It's about you wanting freedom and the message being popular.
[12:22.000 --> 12:24.000]  So let me give you the good news.
[12:24.000 --> 12:32.000]  This show is like having a ice cold water stand in the middle of the Sahara Desert giving out free ice water.
[12:32.000 --> 12:35.000]  It's popular as hell.
[12:35.000 --> 12:43.000]  It's as popular as snow cones in hell because people want freedom and they want justice and they want hard hitting straight talk.
[12:43.000 --> 12:46.000]  And we're going to give it to you unvarnished unfiltered.
[12:46.000 --> 12:50.000]  We make mistakes. Damn right we do. We're the first to admit it when we do.
[12:50.000 --> 12:56.000]  So I just want to tell everybody if you're watching a local station or listening local station, thank them.
[12:56.000 --> 12:57.000]  Spread the word about them.
[12:57.000 --> 12:59.000]  Paint their call letters on the side of your barn.
[12:59.000 --> 13:03.000]  Tell folks in the grocery store and church about it continually.
[13:03.000 --> 13:10.000]  If you don't have a local station, radio, TV or cable, call them and say, hey, Alex Jones has vindicated.
[13:10.000 --> 13:13.000]  His show is exploding and you should pick it up.
[13:13.000 --> 13:18.000]  Or if you want something even more, let's say cerebral, not as extreme, David Knight.
[13:18.000 --> 13:20.000]  And Owen Schroyer does an amazing job.
[13:20.000 --> 13:22.000]  Whatever your flavor is, stick your toe in.
[13:22.000 --> 13:24.000]  You know, pick up David Knight or pick up Owen Schroyer.
[13:24.000 --> 13:25.000]  I don't care.
[13:25.000 --> 13:30.000]  Pick up, we have 10 hours, well now, 12 hours a day of live shows and then retransmissions.
[13:30.000 --> 13:31.000]  And it's all there on the satellites.
[13:31.000 --> 13:37.000]  We've got the high tech systems that you dial in to get the streams from us or the HD downloads.
[13:37.000 --> 13:40.000]  But it's all free to air except for radios.
[13:40.000 --> 13:42.000]  I'm still partnered with Teddy Anderson, great guy in GCN.
[13:42.000 --> 13:44.000]  About half our radio stations are still with him.
[13:44.000 --> 13:45.000]  We love Ted.
[13:45.000 --> 13:46.000]  I've worked with Ted 20 plus years.
[13:46.000 --> 13:49.000]  One of my first big sponsors 24 years ago.
[13:49.000 --> 13:50.000]  And so I've been loyal to Teddy's and loyal to me.
[13:50.000 --> 13:52.000]  He's been a great friend.
[13:52.000 --> 13:55.000]  So we cannot be free to air, you get half the ads of your own radio.
[13:55.000 --> 13:58.000]  And then GCN gets the other half and I get half of those.
[13:58.000 --> 14:01.000]  So basically I get a quarter, Ted gets a quarter.
[14:01.000 --> 14:03.000]  Local stations get half the ads on radio.
[14:03.000 --> 14:04.000]  That's how it operates.
[14:04.000 --> 14:10.000]  But for TV, baby, boom, we got 14 minutes ads an hour.
[14:10.000 --> 14:15.000]  On the other shows, we've gone down to six for TV, Sunday Live, election countdown with
[14:15.000 --> 14:20.000]  Deon Lorraine and coming back to next Monday, Robert Barnes, constitutional lawyer.
[14:20.000 --> 14:23.000]  And does learn a great job, seven to nine.
[14:23.000 --> 14:25.000]  And that's hard hitting stuff you're going to get.
[14:25.000 --> 14:27.000]  Now, listen, Barnes doesn't want me to say this.
[14:27.000 --> 14:29.000]  So I'm not going to tell you, but you can put two together.
[14:29.000 --> 14:35.000]  Let's say he's working with the highest folks in the country and behind the scenes.
[14:35.000 --> 14:41.000]  And he's going to join us coming up in the next hour and explain what happened.
[14:41.000 --> 14:45.000]  He told me days ago, he said the Philadelphia Pennsylvania suit will be thrown out.
[14:45.000 --> 14:49.000]  Supreme Court doesn't want it because it didn't ask the right questions.
[14:49.000 --> 14:50.000]  He will have a lot of evidence.
[14:50.000 --> 14:55.000]  They want it as a state coming in because the state has more standing to be able to put
[14:55.000 --> 14:58.000]  in more evidence and other states can join it.
[14:58.000 --> 15:03.000]  That's the chain reaction they want to give it back to the states and call for legislatures
[15:03.000 --> 15:06.000]  to have emergency sessions to override the fraud.
[15:06.000 --> 15:09.000]  Well, that's why they got out the Pennsylvania one.
[15:09.000 --> 15:11.000]  They're, oh, CNN, they're repudiation of Trump.
[15:11.000 --> 15:13.000]  They're repudiation of Giuliani.
[15:13.000 --> 15:14.000]  It's all over.
[15:14.000 --> 15:18.000]  No, they want to take one suit and have that be the one.
[15:18.000 --> 15:21.000]  And notice they took Texas up, put it on the docket.
[15:21.000 --> 15:25.000]  The other, they refused to hear because they don't want to hear a whole bunch of them.
[15:25.000 --> 15:31.000]  They may still betray America, but they wouldn't be doing that if they were going to be doing that.
[15:31.000 --> 15:33.000]  They would, they would already just have thrown it out.
[15:33.000 --> 15:35.000]  So this is not going to make the globalists happy.
[15:35.000 --> 15:37.000]  And so this is one hell of a fight.
[15:37.000 --> 15:41.000]  We've got to keep getting all the election fraud evidence out because the globalists are trying to
[15:41.000 --> 15:43.000]  suppress that to make it look illegitimate to even question.
[15:43.000 --> 15:46.000]  Google has announced any criticism of the election will be banned.
[15:46.000 --> 15:52.000]  We're talking Venezuela meets 1984, meets Soviet Russia, meets Adolf Hitler,
[15:52.000 --> 15:55.000]  meets Mao Zedong and Buck Rogers, baby.
[15:55.000 --> 15:56.000]  I mean, this is crazy.
[15:56.000 --> 15:57.000]  We'll be right back.
[15:57.000 --> 15:59.000]  You must guard your humanity.
[15:59.000 --> 16:02.000]  You must guard your children's humanity.
[16:02.000 --> 16:05.000]  You must guard the very genetic code of the planet.
[16:05.000 --> 16:09.000]  The globalists have set themselves up as the guardians of this world,
[16:09.000 --> 16:13.000]  but they are the ones that are overriding every genetic system and poisoning the planet.
[16:13.000 --> 16:21.000]  They are the ones that are now engaged in genetic takeover of every human on Earth to the GMO crops.
[16:21.000 --> 16:28.000]  And now they've moved on to their main target, humanity with the mRNA vaccines, which are not vaccines.
[16:28.000 --> 16:33.000]  They are recombinant DNA from aborted cloned fetuses,
[16:33.000 --> 16:39.000]  who are then inserted into your genome to take over your body's systems.
[16:39.000 --> 16:46.000]  Go read the actual inserts for the mRNA vaccines and then remember you've been warned.
[16:46.000 --> 16:49.000]  This is the equivalent of an alien takeover.
[16:49.000 --> 16:51.000]  Whether it's interdimensional, whether it's little green men,
[16:51.000 --> 16:55.000]  the globalists are acting like another species that's overtaking us and overriding us.
[16:55.000 --> 17:10.000]  It's all the same in the end.

[18:22.000 --> 18:31.000]  Well, you play some music from the 60s and talk about Merry Christmas and the 80s and the 90s.
[18:31.000 --> 18:34.000]  Now you don't say it. It's offensive.
[18:34.000 --> 18:41.000]  But a convicted child molester coming to your school unannounced and saying they're a drag queen having your son or daughter bounce on their crotch.
[18:41.000 --> 18:45.000]  Well, they have an erection inside their pants. That's okay.
[18:45.000 --> 18:49.000]  It's all part of the sick left scene we didn't get away with.
[18:49.000 --> 19:01.000]  Now, I've had a big brainstorm, a big epiphany and I'm going to try next segment to lay it all out and really square up with you,
[19:01.000 --> 19:05.000]  really level with you, shoot you straight without any exaggeration.
[19:05.000 --> 19:12.000]  And that means, though, that I've got to really tell you some horrifying stuff because I don't exaggerate.
[19:12.000 --> 19:23.000]  People think it's hyperbole here and the reality is so insane that people can't believe it and that's how it's beating us.
[19:23.000 --> 19:32.000]  I got three phone calls this morning telling me about the same thing from totally separate different people.
[19:32.000 --> 19:35.000]  And that's when you know you've hit a zeitgeist.
[19:35.000 --> 19:47.000]  Three different people. Well, one texted me to called me and said, Have you heard what's in this new vaccine?
[19:47.000 --> 19:53.000]  They were sending me video. So they were sending me articles. I'm going to show you what three different people sent me here in a moment.
[19:53.000 --> 20:02.000]  Now, two of them basically sent me the same thing. One of them actually sent me a scientific document.
[20:02.000 --> 20:14.000]  But the point is they were having that come to Jesus moment where there are the entire genome of a cloned boy, a baby they killed in 1966.
[20:14.000 --> 20:27.000]  Yeah, this is old technology in the mRNA vaccine from AstraZeneca and they put the entire genome of a baby boy.
[20:27.000 --> 20:33.000]  They killed in 1966 into your body.
[20:33.000 --> 20:40.000]  Now, see the left will be like, I don't care if it's somebody's DNA. Well, how about you know what that means?
[20:40.000 --> 20:54.000]  Because I've got all these scientists and all these doctors explaining in these geneticists that this is pure experimentation and that this type of DNA
[20:54.000 --> 21:01.000]  is a type of DNA that programs DNA and is really only supposed to be from the sperm in the egg.
[21:01.000 --> 21:08.000]  I mean, this is like in a movie where the scientist injects somebody and they mutate and turn into something else.
[21:08.000 --> 21:22.000]  I mean, this is so bold, so insane, so revolutionary, so over the top that I am just completely dumbfounded and stunned
[21:22.000 --> 21:25.000]  that they would go this hard, this direct.
[21:25.000 --> 21:31.000]  But I remember Mike Adams was on like two years ago and wrote an article in Natural News freaking out going,
[21:31.000 --> 21:35.000]  the entire genome is in this new mRNA vaccine for the flu.
[21:35.000 --> 21:40.000]  He wrote, I remember hearing that and looking at it going, yeah, it is a whole person's genome.
[21:40.000 --> 21:43.000]  Well, that's what's in this particular mRNA one.
[21:43.000 --> 21:50.000]  And now they've got, I mean, the former chief medical officer of Pfizer saying this will sterilize women.
[21:50.000 --> 21:58.000]  They've got the head of the EU Medical Commission saying that the super prestigious Italian doctors, Indian doctors,
[21:58.000 --> 22:05.000]  I mean, it's cut and dry, but see, it's Stockholm syndrome.
[22:05.000 --> 22:11.000]  See, I'm an alpha male, so when I was a kid, I had the alpha genes, I guess,
[22:11.000 --> 22:16.000]  and I'd see a super movie like Jason 513 where a guy's coming in with a knife and you don't fight back and you run,
[22:16.000 --> 22:20.000]  you fall down, you bleed. I thought that was fake. I've grown up now.
[22:20.000 --> 22:26.000]  Actually, the average man or woman does fall down and starts groveling and going, please, no, no, no.
[22:26.000 --> 22:31.000]  But now actually, if Jason pulled a knife out, the average liberal would run up and grab it and go, I love you.
[22:31.000 --> 22:36.000]  I love you. This is good for me. I mean, because that's what Stockholm syndrome is.
[22:36.000 --> 22:44.000]  Joe Rogan had this weird, effeminate, that's mean to women, whatever he was, blob creature on his show.
[22:44.000 --> 22:53.000]  I sent the clip to you a couple days ago. It's a headline like Joe Rogan questions, you know, Bill Gates,
[22:53.000 --> 22:57.000]  why is 80% getting sick, something like that. And the guy's like, I really want it.
[22:57.000 --> 23:02.000]  I'll take whatever they tell me. I trust them. And Joe's like, yeah, but you take the first shot of mRNA
[23:02.000 --> 23:05.000]  and then the next was when you get really sick because you have an autoimmune response
[23:05.000 --> 23:10.000]  and you have an allergic response that's really dangerous. Then I go, nonsense. I love it. I want it.
[23:10.000 --> 23:16.000]  Yeah, this is the video. And then right here, they come out and say, do not take the mRNA vaccine.
[23:16.000 --> 23:24.000]  If you've got any allergies, it might kill you. What allergies? They go peanut, shellfish, bee stings.
[23:24.000 --> 23:28.000]  What did I tell you yesterday at a thousand times? I've read the damn literature.
[23:28.000 --> 23:35.000]  If you've ever had an aside-of-kind storm in your life and swole up red and not been able to breathe like most of us have,
[23:35.000 --> 23:41.000]  you live long enough, you can't take this. It can't kill you.
[23:41.000 --> 23:49.000]  But notice CNN's telling you they're like, okay, don't take it if you've ever had an allergy.
[23:49.000 --> 23:55.000]  Oh, by the way, six people died in the Pfizer study. Oh, by the way, a lot of people got Guillain-Barre
[23:55.000 --> 24:02.000]  and, you know, 10,000 kids did get narcolepsy. Some died from the flu shot in Sweden.
[24:02.000 --> 24:08.000]  Oh, and 59 died here from the flu shot. Oh, and, oh, by the way, this doesn't even pretend.
[24:08.000 --> 24:13.000]  And then the scientists look what's in this stuff and they go, this doesn't even protect you from COVID-19.
[24:13.000 --> 24:21.000]  This has got a protein that's the same as this other 10-year-old mRNA vaccine that sterilizes pigs, eats the placenta.
[24:21.000 --> 24:26.000]  Looks like it's just, I mean, and then we've got all the women, yeah, that they've been injecting,
[24:26.000 --> 24:33.000]  or that can never have a baby again. And you're like, well, that's a dumb, poor, native savage, let her get sterilized.
[24:33.000 --> 24:37.000]  You know what, BS, that's a human being. And here's another thing, you jackass leftist.
[24:37.000 --> 24:44.000]  You Stockholm syndrome. They're coming for you, you dumb sack of garbage.
[24:44.000 --> 24:52.000]  The left is the most alone, most stupid, most thieving. They don't live as long. They're depressed.
[24:52.000 --> 25:02.000]  The left are the cursed losers that have fallen first, but like Renfield serving Dracula, like, oh, yes, master, oh, oh, can I do this?
[25:02.000 --> 25:09.000]  I mean, that's who they are. So stop bowing to them when they tell us how to talk or what to do or wear a mask.
[25:09.000 --> 25:21.000]  These are the losers who are organized into an army of lemmings who want to overrun other poor people so they can pretend to be their master.
[25:21.000 --> 25:29.000]  Dracula doesn't give Renfield children like he gives his, his queens.
[25:29.000 --> 25:36.000]  No, Renfield gets to eat bugs and maybe rats, rats, please have a rat.
[25:36.000 --> 25:40.000]  And all of that is art types of these very people.
[25:40.000 --> 25:45.000]  In fact, get the rat-like creature. There's a bunch of cussing on it, so edit it down, whatever his name is.
[25:45.000 --> 25:52.000]  Get me his name, the video. I want to play with him. Because his voice starts, he goes, I like vaccines.
[25:52.000 --> 26:02.000]  He starts like snorting and honking like a warthog. He's a journalist.
[26:02.000 --> 26:06.000]  And he's up there telling you it's all wonderful and it's all perfect.
[26:06.000 --> 26:09.000]  Okay, I said I'd cover it next segment. I'm already getting into it.
[26:09.000 --> 26:19.000]  I've done hours of research quietly reading this and then I get on air and I just, I just, by the way, you know, this psycho garbage didn't take him the shots himself.
[26:19.000 --> 26:22.000]  He just wants to growl at the system.
[26:22.000 --> 26:26.000]  You know what about the system? Brian Stelter, all of them look like this.
[26:26.000 --> 26:37.000]  I mean, I'm not saying that this guy is, well, you know what, I'm just saying if I was casting a movie for a creepy dude that served Dracula
[26:37.000 --> 26:40.000]  and grabs kids off the streets, it takes them to a dungeon to be this guy.
[26:40.000 --> 26:48.000]  In fact, we found someone creeper than Brian Stelter. I forget his name, but we'll talk about it.
[26:48.000 --> 26:57.000]  But those of us tied into the life force, do we behave like we're living dead? No, we're on fire with the spirit of Genesis.
[26:57.000 --> 27:00.000]  The globalists and their minions want to play God.
[27:00.000 --> 27:08.000]  Chuck E. Schumer, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, you look at these sacks of garbage and you think, why do they hate humanity so much?
[27:08.000 --> 27:12.000]  Why do they love death? Because they hate themselves.
[27:12.000 --> 27:18.000]  They project their own disgust with their soul onto us.
[27:18.000 --> 27:23.000]  And once you understand that basic psychological point, every other answer is completely clear.
[27:23.000 --> 27:29.000]  That's why they hate info wars. We believe in humanity. We think you're beautiful. We think you're amazing.
[27:29.000 --> 27:34.000]  Info wars knows you're falling, but that you have God's potential that God gave you.
[27:34.000 --> 27:38.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, the great epic battle is now here. It's now upon us.
[27:38.000 --> 27:44.000]  I want to encourage you all to spread the word about info wars now more than ever, when the enemy hopes to shut down the light of truth.
[27:44.000 --> 27:47.000]  We know you're going to override these globalists. We know you're going to defeat them.
[27:47.000 --> 27:57.000]  I just want to salute you all for your action, everything you've already done, because God's on our side and the globalists know it.
[27:57.000 --> 28:01.000]  The project for world government developed by the British Empire via Cecil Rhodes,
[28:01.000 --> 28:06.000]  then picked up by the Rockefeller family and the major robber barons, the planet by the 1920s,
[28:06.000 --> 28:09.000]  is all about corporate global governance.
[28:09.000 --> 28:13.000]  And now you're seeing it, not just the blue states, the blue cities, the communists and socialists,
[28:13.000 --> 28:19.000]  nations all working in unison under UN control, established a medical planetary dictatorship.
[28:19.000 --> 28:26.000]  At the core of it is the Fortune 100 corporations, themselves funded by a handful of private central banking families.
[28:26.000 --> 28:31.000]  The Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, the Dutch and British royalty being at the very heart of that.
[28:31.000 --> 28:35.000]  Then you learn the Dutch and British royalty aren't even Dutch or British at the same time,
[28:35.000 --> 28:42.000]  but they go back to the literal count Dracula and the wars in between Christendom and Islam.
[28:42.000 --> 28:46.000]  Those that don't know history really are doomed to repeat it.
[28:46.000 --> 28:51.000]  They're involved in poting the world economy. That's what the social distancing the masks are all about.
[28:51.000 --> 28:57.000]  It's about bankrupting local small businesses and those that comply are complying with your own destruction. Wake up.
[28:57.000 --> 29:03.000]  Imagine a dystopic novel or a dystopic science fiction movie where if you've had a cold,
[29:03.000 --> 29:08.000]  you can be locked up in your home, you can be taken away, you can be forcibly inoculated
[29:08.000 --> 29:13.000]  with drugs that masquerade as vaccines that actually change your very DNA.
[29:13.000 --> 29:17.000]  That's where we are in the year 2020. Global government of the United Nations.
[29:17.000 --> 29:24.000]  All of the authoritarian groups admit they're doing it. They even admit that they're doing it for power and control
[29:24.000 --> 29:29.000]  and that they're not even worried about COVID-19. That's what Klaus Schwab and others have said.
[29:29.000 --> 29:34.000]  Think about how it's saying that it's oh, and big tech's got to track you, they've got to trace you, they've got to control you.
[29:34.000 --> 29:39.000]  You've got to have absolutely your house. Why? You've got to have secret police come disappear you,
[29:39.000 --> 29:43.000]  because my God, this thing has one tenth of one percent chance of killing you.
[29:43.000 --> 29:48.000]  Give your ability to cancer or heart attack. This is their takeover.
[29:48.000 --> 29:53.000]  Imagine on America's death certificate killed by the fear of the common cold.
[29:53.000 --> 30:14.000]  Yeah, that's fair monitoring. That's mind control.
[30:23.000 --> 30:29.000]  That's a way to make it sexy that, hey, we're experimenting on our troops.
[30:29.000 --> 30:36.000]  We'll send things with that into our troops, and thousands and thousands of died each time they tried a new experimental vaccine.
[30:36.000 --> 30:41.000]  And I've talked to high-level folks inside the federal government and the state of Texas Health Department.
[30:41.000 --> 30:44.000]  They say Alex, you know it hurts a lot of people, but it's for a greater good.
[30:44.000 --> 30:50.000]  But that's not even true. And it violates the Geneva Convention, the Nuremberg Code, federal and state law.
[30:50.000 --> 30:53.000]  This is violence being carried out against us by that necessarily.
[30:53.000 --> 31:22.000]  And we have a right to resist it with any means necessary.
[31:23.000 --> 31:33.000]  We have a right to resist it with any means necessary.
[31:33.000 --> 31:43.000]  We have a right to resist it with any means necessary.
[31:43.000 --> 31:53.000]  We have a right to resist it with any means necessary.
[31:53.000 --> 32:03.000]  We have a right to resist it with any means necessary.
[32:03.000 --> 32:13.000]  We have a right to resist it with any means necessary.
[32:13.000 --> 32:23.000]  We have a right to resist it with any means necessary.
[32:23.000 --> 32:33.000]  Okay folks, we're back live here. Doing the best we can to cover all this for you.
[32:33.000 --> 32:45.000]  This is some really heavy stuff, and it's hard to just sit up here and talk about all this and watch the mass Stockholm syndrome and watch everybody marching to their own destruction and keep a cool head about it.
[32:45.000 --> 32:53.000]  Because this has all been psychologically engaged in to incrementally just prepare you for the horrors that are coming.
[32:53.000 --> 32:58.000]  Because they got to get to a point where they're not just sterilizing and killing and wiping out third-world populations.
[32:58.000 --> 33:00.000]  They want to kill you particularly.
[33:00.000 --> 33:12.000]  But they want to slowly take all the wealth out of you while you die from all these new diseases they've developed with these new genetic engineering systems
[33:12.000 --> 33:22.000]  that are completely taking over the human body and rewriting every cell in you.
[33:22.000 --> 33:27.000]  Other than the eyes and a few other tissues.
[33:27.000 --> 33:30.000]  The edge and the ovaries as I said yesterday.
[33:30.000 --> 33:36.000]  And there is a large master plan behind all this.
[33:36.000 --> 33:39.000]  And the globalists have said what that plan is.
[33:39.000 --> 33:54.000]  And they admit they are testing on the people to reduce population while they develop gene therapies and advanced cloning technologies for themselves on a genetic path to immortality.
[33:54.000 --> 34:01.000]  But more and more they believe in a silicon path to immortality and those are two competing arms of what they're doing.
[34:01.000 --> 34:14.000]  My frustration is simply trying to get people to think for themselves and to pull back and think like a globalist.
[34:14.000 --> 34:19.000]  Don't agree with the evil and the corruption and their end game.
[34:19.000 --> 34:24.000]  But look at the world as engineers and as scientists and as controllers.
[34:24.000 --> 34:32.000]  Because we're never going to have a change of the system until we can meet them head on and have a discussion with them about what they're doing.
[34:32.000 --> 34:36.000]  And again this isn't about me but who else is at this level.
[34:36.000 --> 34:40.000]  You understand that the globalists have tried to buy me off 20 or 30 times.
[34:40.000 --> 34:43.000]  The globalists kiss my ass.
[34:43.000 --> 34:44.000]  I don't care about that.
[34:44.000 --> 34:45.000]  That's why they want me.
[34:45.000 --> 34:53.000]  They know I know their plan and they go Jones you know the plan you're supposed to be with us that the public doesn't want to be saved.
[34:53.000 --> 34:54.000]  They're dangerous.
[34:54.000 --> 34:56.000]  We got to do this.
[34:56.000 --> 35:01.000]  And then I sit here and people just think this is some joke we're up here doing.
[35:01.000 --> 35:03.000]  This is not a joke.
[35:03.000 --> 35:06.000]  I got a skull right here on the table.
[35:06.000 --> 35:07.000]  It's not a plastic skull.
[35:07.000 --> 35:09.000]  This is a real skull.
[35:09.000 --> 35:15.000]  And I got this to remind all of you what this is all about.
[35:15.000 --> 35:20.000]  Because we're not just talking about the end of an individual.
[35:20.000 --> 35:24.000]  We're talking about the end of the species.
[35:24.000 --> 35:30.000]  And the fact that what the globalist are building is not a system to make this better.
[35:30.000 --> 35:35.000]  But a system to destroy this as they say and to transcend it.
[35:35.000 --> 35:47.000]  And if you had any gray matter inside your head and if you weren't dead inside you'd know that.
[35:47.000 --> 35:51.000]  So I'm extremely angry.
[35:51.000 --> 36:00.000]  Because I've intellectually looked at every angle of this and I've sat there and I've read the new order statements thousands of times and I've read them on air thousands of times.
[36:00.000 --> 36:01.000]  And.
[36:01.000 --> 36:03.000]  Their plan is so complete.
[36:03.000 --> 36:05.000]  Their plan is so thought out.
[36:05.000 --> 36:12.000]  And their plan is so incredibly totally hideous.
[36:12.000 --> 36:20.000]  So why should we have to go through this I mean I could sit here and show you their disinfo their operations.
[36:20.000 --> 36:28.000]  They're flaunting at your face what they're doing how they're rolling it out we already told you all this before you already figured it all out.
[36:28.000 --> 36:32.000]  The question is we have to stop behaving normally.
[36:32.000 --> 36:35.000]  When we go to the grocery store or we go to church we go anywhere.
[36:35.000 --> 36:44.000]  We've got to be telling people that there's this takeover happening and we've got to be warning them about what's about to happen to them.
[36:44.000 --> 36:55.000]  Or when they get sterilized or when they get epilepsy or when they get the on berets or when they get narcolepsy or when they get a brain tumor or when their testicles literally fall off.
[36:55.000 --> 37:07.000]  Overies literally swell up in huge pustules and explode inside of them and agonizing pain they need to know who did it and who loaded the gun.
[37:07.000 --> 37:18.000]  And the fact that their cheapest acquiescence and their belief that this is all for their own good was the author of their destruction.
[37:18.000 --> 37:25.000]  So that after they've been damaged because we know they're not going to listen now.
[37:25.000 --> 37:30.000]  They'll listen later and warn others and learn from their mistakes.
[37:30.000 --> 37:35.000]  Because I believe you're not animals and I believe you deserve to not have this done to you.
[37:35.000 --> 37:37.000]  And I'll tell you why I'm sure of that.
[37:37.000 --> 37:40.000]  History research the Holy Spirit.
[37:40.000 --> 37:48.000]  Just being around the New World Order and watching them and knowing how unhappy they are and how robotic they are and how cursed they are.
[37:48.000 --> 37:53.000]  The system they've got and who they are and what they do is not a place you want to be.
[37:53.000 --> 38:03.000]  It's not something you want to be part of.
[38:03.000 --> 38:04.000]  People aren't serious.
[38:04.000 --> 38:05.000]  We've been raised as children.
[38:05.000 --> 38:06.000]  We watch TV.
[38:06.000 --> 38:09.000]  We screw around and you're going to get hurt real bad folks.
[38:09.000 --> 38:19.000]  You're already been hurt and you're going to just see things exponentially like you're in a car and you run off the median and you can't believe you're flipping.
[38:19.000 --> 38:21.000]  And then you get out and your arms cut off.
[38:21.000 --> 38:22.000]  Can't believe blood spraying out.
[38:22.000 --> 38:24.000]  I mean, that's where you are already.
[38:24.000 --> 38:26.000]  Okay.
[38:26.000 --> 38:31.000]  We've already been in the car wreck.
[38:31.000 --> 38:38.000]  And there's time to patch all this up, but we have to repudiate the people in control of this and let them know we know their plan and let them know we're going to resist.
[38:38.000 --> 38:47.000]  Because that's the only thing on this planet that has standing is resisting this and saying no to it.
[38:47.000 --> 38:49.000]  All right.
[38:49.000 --> 38:51.000]  You know, I haven't really hit any of the news.
[38:51.000 --> 39:05.000]  We've got Robert Barnes coming up and he's got Trump's real path to victory and what happened and why Supreme Court didn't take the Pennsylvania case but took the Texas case because the Texas case had better standing.
[39:05.000 --> 39:08.000]  It wasn't about what was in the legislation.
[39:08.000 --> 39:21.000]  It was about the standing that Texas and other states can now join and they can bring in evidence because they have standing representing the voters.
[39:21.000 --> 39:27.000]  And they want this to be a state's movement against the election fraud because the election fraud came out of the states.
[39:27.000 --> 39:37.000]  So CNN's up there saying oh, this all happened.
[39:37.000 --> 39:41.000]  Trump's done Pennsylvania.
[39:41.000 --> 39:54.000]  Supreme Court refused to hear it, but no coverage static dead silence when it comes to the Texas case with all these other states joining us so
[39:54.000 --> 40:01.000]  we'll be on with us in the second hour today via Skype.
[40:01.000 --> 40:08.000]  But I will try my best judiciously to at least tell you what I'm going to cover in the third hour.
[40:08.000 --> 40:13.000]  And I'll try to smooth out and do it as best I can.
[40:13.000 --> 40:17.000]  And that deals with the COVID-19 bio weapon attack.
[40:17.000 --> 40:18.000]  And I'm not talking about the virus.
[40:18.000 --> 40:21.000]  I'm talking about the response is the bio weapon attack.
[40:21.000 --> 40:26.000]  And that's not my opinion. That's top scientists, medical doctors, the top lawyer, professor, author of the U.S.
[40:26.000 --> 40:29.000]  Biological Weapons Law, the main contributor to the U.N.
[40:29.000 --> 40:31.000]  World Government Treaty.
[40:31.000 --> 40:32.000]  This is it.
[40:32.000 --> 40:33.000]  Okay.
[40:33.000 --> 40:34.000]  Believe me, I wish it wasn't.
[40:34.000 --> 40:35.000]  This is it.
[40:35.000 --> 40:36.000]  This is it.
[40:36.000 --> 40:43.000]  And it's all a test to see how many of us can they kill, maim and damage right in front of our eyes and get away with it.
[40:43.000 --> 40:49.000]  And then once we pass this test of submission, they're going to release even more deadly bio weapons.
[40:49.000 --> 40:53.000]  And they fry us like an egg on a skillet with a 5G.
[41:19.000 --> 41:24.000]  Thank you to all of you that have supported the broadcast and the websites and the films and all the rest of the information we put out
[41:24.000 --> 41:27.000]  to realize how important your work has been and to redouble your efforts.
[41:27.000 --> 41:29.000]  So I salute you and I thank you.
[41:29.000 --> 41:32.000]  Also, as Christmas is almost here, don't wait.

[41:52.000 --> 41:55.000]  And again, thank you all for your support and Merry Christmas.
[41:55.000 --> 42:24.000]  God bless.
[42:25.000 --> 42:31.000]  They told us that two and a half million people would be dead just eight months ago within three months.
[42:31.000 --> 42:36.000]  Okay, it's a quarter million if you count all of the people that died of other things.
[42:36.000 --> 42:39.000]  We're talking 96% had co-morbidity.
[42:39.000 --> 42:40.000]  These are real numbers.
[42:40.000 --> 42:41.000]  These are real facts.
[42:41.000 --> 42:46.000]  This is the chicken little event where we all run our houses, never come out and are taught we're not essential.
[42:46.000 --> 42:49.000]  All the big box stores in Amazon take over the planet.
[42:49.000 --> 42:51.000]  You could stand up against it.
[42:51.000 --> 42:52.000]  This is slavery.
[42:52.000 --> 42:57.000]  It is not something you can put up with and survive.
[42:57.000 --> 43:00.000]  The globalists have always been at war with the family and small businesses.
[43:00.000 --> 43:01.000]  They want control.
[43:01.000 --> 43:03.000]  They want domesticated slaves.
[43:03.000 --> 43:06.000]  That's the process that is taking place right now.
[43:06.000 --> 43:10.000]  And when you shop at the big box stores and when you shop with Amazon,
[43:10.000 --> 43:18.000]  remember that they are creating monopolies and they are the globalists that are pushing the lockdowns, gun control, abortion, world government, all of it.
[43:18.000 --> 43:26.000]  If you want to do that, go ahead and shop there, but if you'll shop at InfoWars where we have thousands of products made right here in America with our warehouses and our crew,
[43:26.000 --> 43:29.000]  it's incredible and it changes the whole world.
[43:29.000 --> 43:32.000]  So do your shopping if you want to fund the InfoWars.
[43:32.000 --> 43:37.000]  If you want to stop the globalist at InfoWarsStore.com and tell others to do their shopping at InfoWars.com.
[43:37.000 --> 43:38.000]  We have amazing products.
[43:38.000 --> 43:43.000]  We can get everything delivered to you by Christmas if you order by the 18th.
[43:43.000 --> 43:45.000]  So again, I want to thank you all for your support.
[43:45.000 --> 43:52.000]  I want to thank you for thinking through what you do and where you spend your money and do your shopping and get great products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[44:16.000 --> 44:21.000]  This is absorbed under the tongue into the bloodstream and then the remaining also is then absorbed by the stomach.
[44:21.000 --> 44:24.000]  So it's more of an intense delivery system.
[44:24.000 --> 44:29.000]  The two formulas are different, but both are concentrated and our first product got rave reviews.
[44:29.000 --> 44:31.000]  We've now been testing this out for several months.
[44:31.000 --> 44:33.000]  Some of our staff like it more than bodies.
[44:33.000 --> 44:35.000]  Some like bodies better.
[44:35.000 --> 44:40.000]  For me, they're both amazing for their anti-inflammatory action and so much more and they fund the InfoWars.
[44:40.000 --> 44:46.000]  So get our new Liquid Tumeric Extract exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com today, an additional 25% off.
[44:46.000 --> 44:49.000]  This is a 360 win.
[44:49.000 --> 44:52.000]  Tumeric is renowned for what it does for all of our bodies.
[44:52.000 --> 45:11.000]  For inflammation and so much more, get yours today at InfoWarsLive.com.
[45:22.000 --> 45:48.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, Robert Barnes is joining us in the next hour to get into the fact that Trump has a real path to victory,
[45:48.000 --> 45:57.000]  but we've got to give him the support, we've got to create the optics and the pressure that the American people understand what's happening and aren't going to buy into this fraud.
[45:57.000 --> 46:00.000]  So this takes a lot to tango.
[46:00.000 --> 46:02.000]  It takes a lot of people to tango.
[46:02.000 --> 46:04.000]  You've got to have more than one.
[46:04.000 --> 46:06.000]  And so we've got to come together.
[46:06.000 --> 46:07.000]  That is next hour.
[46:07.000 --> 46:08.000]  I suggest you tune in.
[46:08.000 --> 46:14.000]  Again, he's been working directly with folks at the highest levels of the White House and I'll just leave it at that.
[46:14.000 --> 46:16.000]  So he's got the inside scoop and baseball.
[46:16.000 --> 46:21.000]  I can tell you, we're very honored to have him joining us coming up.
[46:21.000 --> 46:27.000]  And I've twisted his arm to come back with the election countdown that we told you the 7-9 days of hell.
[46:27.000 --> 46:29.000]  Starting next Monday, he'll be co-hosting with the Honorable Rain.
[46:29.000 --> 46:31.000]  That was my plan all along.
[46:31.000 --> 46:36.000]  But he will start again, co-hosting five nights a week with her, 7 to 9 p.m.
[46:36.000 --> 46:42.000]  She'll be on the night, 7 o'clock Central Standard Time and on the same TV and radio stations.
[46:42.000 --> 46:45.000]  Okay.
[46:45.000 --> 46:49.000]  There are at least six mRNA vaccines.
[46:49.000 --> 46:52.000]  Again, when you say vaccine, that's a lie.
[46:52.000 --> 46:54.000]  They're not a vaccine.
[46:54.000 --> 46:57.000]  A vaccine is multi-thousand-year-old technology.
[46:57.000 --> 46:58.000]  The Egyptians had it.
[46:58.000 --> 47:00.000]  The ancient British had it.
[47:00.000 --> 47:01.000]  The Romans had it.
[47:01.000 --> 47:05.000]  If somebody had smallpox, if a cow had smallpox, you'd stick a toothpick in it.
[47:05.000 --> 47:10.000]  When people were healthy, stick it in their arm and you would learn in the immunity of smallpox.
[47:10.000 --> 47:13.000]  You didn't want to get it in the winter when you were already sick and run down.
[47:13.000 --> 47:16.000]  They found smallpox, if you caught it from a person, would kill you.
[47:16.000 --> 47:17.000]  They didn't know why.
[47:17.000 --> 47:20.000]  If the winter didn't have vitamin D3, it would kill you sometimes.
[47:20.000 --> 47:24.000]  If you were a healthy person, you could read the old Roman stuff, the old British stuff,
[47:24.000 --> 47:26.000]  they would poke you with the pus.
[47:26.000 --> 47:28.000]  He only died like 1% of the time.
[47:28.000 --> 47:33.000]  And there's whole documentaries and movies and history books written about it.
[47:33.000 --> 47:35.000]  Okay.
[47:35.000 --> 47:40.000]  So, the media spends it to go, oh, the founding fathers were pro-vaccination.
[47:40.000 --> 47:44.000]  Well, if people decided to do it, they did it, but they knew there was a danger.
[47:44.000 --> 47:46.000]  That is not what's happening.
[47:46.000 --> 47:51.000]  And again, I know the general audience knows this, but new listeners tuning in every five seconds, every second.
[47:51.000 --> 48:01.000]  mRNA is a type of programmed DNA that is in sperm and in eggs, basically.
[48:01.000 --> 48:05.000]  And I'm putting this in layman terms, that programs.
[48:05.000 --> 48:07.000]  Now, you heard people get cancer.
[48:07.000 --> 48:10.000]  And a lot of that's from viruses that are able to go in and reprogram cells.
[48:10.000 --> 48:17.000]  So, when a virus goes in and is able to reprogram a cell's mitochondrial DNA,
[48:17.000 --> 48:21.000]  that is the same technology as mRNA.
[48:21.000 --> 48:28.000]  It's reprogramming your cells and causing a chain reaction.
[48:28.000 --> 48:34.000]  That's why they say, we may have to give you the shot five times to finally get your body to have the autoimmune response,
[48:34.000 --> 48:43.000]  which means then you will be allergic to any contaminant in the vaccine or to any coronavirus the rest of your life.
[48:43.000 --> 48:48.000]  And every scientist and virologist that looks at this is going, what the hell?
[48:48.000 --> 48:55.000]  This is like saying, shoot your baby in the head with a shotgun so it doesn't get a cold.
[48:55.000 --> 48:57.000]  It's so destructive, it's so dangerous.
[48:57.000 --> 49:00.000]  But then Christians and others are looking at it and going, excuse me,
[49:00.000 --> 49:09.000]  all these major vaccines come from cloned embryos and cloned fetuses and their cloned genome,
[49:09.000 --> 49:17.000]  that is the carrier, because again, it's a fast replicating cell into the body to cause this.
[49:17.000 --> 49:20.000]  I mean, this is the toxic Avenger.
[49:20.000 --> 49:21.000]  This is alien.
[49:21.000 --> 49:26.000]  This is giant genetic engineering on a huge scale with them trying to get waivers.
[49:26.000 --> 49:30.000]  So I could read you the scientific reports and all the new scientists have come out and everything,
[49:30.000 --> 49:40.000]  but this is a viral video that a woman in the UK shot of the particular vaccine that she had,
[49:40.000 --> 49:46.000]  the AstraZeneca, that caused a bunch of deaths and illnesses when they took them out of the study.
[49:46.000 --> 49:52.000]  And this is her reading to you as a layperson and Googling in herself, which everyone should do so you know the truth.
[49:52.000 --> 49:59.000]  Here it is, a cloned baby that died in 1966, has been recloned over and over again,
[49:59.000 --> 50:05.000]  and their full genetic order is being injected into you with recombinant DNA to re-engineer your whole body,
[50:05.000 --> 50:09.000]  and then of course it creates a protein that attacks the placenta so you can't have a baby.
[50:09.000 --> 50:15.000]  I mean, this is just a bold, mass assault, so evil, so huge, they think that they'll just get away with it
[50:15.000 --> 50:18.000]  because it's such a crime, no one will want to admit they did it,
[50:18.000 --> 50:24.000]  and they'll get all the doctors and the system on board so it's too evil to fail. Turn my coin. Here it is.
[50:24.000 --> 50:26.000]  Okay, we're live on We Are Vax.
[50:26.000 --> 50:28.000]  We are live on Vax through Instagram.
[50:28.000 --> 50:35.000]  Right, people, we have a bit of information. I want you to listen, hear this incredibly well.
[50:35.000 --> 50:39.000]  This is a fact. I want you to share this everywhere.
[50:39.000 --> 50:44.000]  I want you to screen grab it. I want you to copy it, whatever it takes, because they will take this down.
[50:44.000 --> 50:51.000]  This is a fact. Share to all of your Bible groups or anybody else that doesn't want aborted fetal tissue,
[50:51.000 --> 50:55.000]  fragments put into them, or their DNA changed.
[50:55.000 --> 51:04.000]  This is a fact. This is the packaging of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine.
[51:04.000 --> 51:08.000]  Okay? Right in front of you. I want you to look at this, okay?
[51:08.000 --> 51:14.000]  I want you to look at it and list ingredients. I'm not interested in that right now.
[51:14.000 --> 51:21.000]  I want you to home in on this here. This is the COVID-19 vaccine. Claire's just going to pull this up for you.
[51:21.000 --> 51:28.000]  This number, okay, it's called CHAD, whatever that is, zero, whatever it is, times one.
[51:28.000 --> 51:36.000]  Okay, this is the CHAD, zero times one. The COVID-19 vaccine. So Claire, go to the next one.
[51:36.000 --> 51:44.000]  I can, guys. Okay, so then you're going to go and go to researchsquare.com.
[51:44.000 --> 51:50.000]  It's really important, people, the reason we're doing these videos is because I want you to learn to do your own research.
[51:50.000 --> 51:53.000]  Don't rely on us or anybody else. Do it yourself.
[51:53.000 --> 51:59.000]  So we look up this CHAD, zero times one, COVID-19.
[51:59.000 --> 52:03.000]  And the first thing, before we go to what I bring there, is I'm looking and I'm thinking,
[52:03.000 --> 52:06.000]  what's recombinant? What does that even mean?
[52:06.000 --> 52:09.000]  So I asked the new and I asked them, they were like, gosh, don't know.
[52:09.000 --> 52:15.000]  So let's do, this is what you need to do. You need to Google every single word on here.
[52:15.000 --> 52:18.000]  Don't skip by it thinking, oh, that science don't understand.
[52:18.000 --> 52:26.000]  So Claire, let's look up this word on Wikipedia and straight away, there you see it, recombinant.
[52:26.000 --> 52:34.000]  Our DNA molecules are DNA molecules formed by laboratory methods of genetic recombination,
[52:34.000 --> 52:40.000]  such as molecule cloning, to bring together genetic material from multiple sources,
[52:40.000 --> 52:46.000]  creating sequences that would not otherwise be found in the genome.
[52:46.000 --> 52:48.000]  Okay, you do that research yourself.
[52:48.000 --> 52:57.000]  But my point is, again, it's right in front of your face that this stuff is in this vaccine.
[52:57.000 --> 53:02.000]  So they can call us crazies and terrible hosts that spread terrible, fear-mongering things.
[53:02.000 --> 53:06.000]  They're putting it right in front of your face. Okay, go back to that thing again.
[53:06.000 --> 53:10.000]  So what we're asking you to do is do your own research.
[53:10.000 --> 53:13.000]  Okay, we've started off for you. So back to this number.
[53:13.000 --> 53:18.000]  That means that AstraZeneca package, I just showed you, this is their vaccine.
[53:18.000 --> 53:26.000]  And as they go down, again, we use direct RNA sequencing to analyze transcript expression.
[53:26.000 --> 53:28.000]  Okay, there's about four minutes left of this.
[53:28.000 --> 53:30.000]  I'm going to play it next segment and Robert Barnes joins us.
[53:30.000 --> 53:39.000]  But then she goes and shows it is an entire cloned genome of a baby boy killed by an abortion in 1966.
[53:39.000 --> 53:47.000]  And that has been cloned, I guess, millions of times, producing his cloned genome to be now put into people.
[53:47.000 --> 53:49.000]  And this has been going on in animals for 30 years.
[53:49.000 --> 53:53.000]  It's going on in humans in China, super soldiers, all this crap.
[53:53.000 --> 53:56.000]  They're experimenting on everyone.
[53:56.000 --> 54:01.000]  And the scientists have reverse engineered this and gone, this doesn't protect you from COVID-19.
[54:01.000 --> 54:05.000]  How even the drug companies say that?
[54:05.000 --> 54:11.000]  It causes violent autoimmune responses, turns off some people's immune system altogether so you die of cancer.
[54:11.000 --> 54:14.000]  You get cancer, we're going to have an immune system, that's what it mainly fights.
[54:14.000 --> 54:20.000]  And others, childbearing women, in fact, they're even kind of saying,
[54:20.000 --> 54:25.000]  actually, women planning to have children, you might not want to take this or consult your doctor,
[54:25.000 --> 54:27.000]  but that's a footnote in fine print.
[54:27.000 --> 54:30.000]  On the news, it's like, it's great, don't listen to people.
[54:30.000 --> 54:37.000]  It says, well, the scientist said it might sterilize you, so the claim it does is false, it might sterilize you.
[54:37.000 --> 54:41.000]  I mean, this is just mad scientists coming after us.
[54:41.000 --> 54:45.000]  Briefly, we're not going to be on air if you don't support us.
[54:45.000 --> 54:46.000]  I'm not bitching, I'm not complaining.
[54:46.000 --> 54:50.000]  I told you in the first couple of segments that our audience is basically three to five times whatever was.
[54:50.000 --> 54:52.000]  Their attempt to shut us down totally failed.
[54:52.000 --> 54:56.000]  We have a gigantic audience of new people, no one's buying anything.
[54:56.000 --> 55:01.000]  And so we're totally winning when it comes to reaching people, we're paying for the bandwidth of Band-Aid video,
[55:01.000 --> 55:05.000]  millions of dollars a year, besides getting millions of views a day.
[55:05.000 --> 55:07.000]  But I need money to fight this war.
[55:07.000 --> 55:10.000]  Infowarsstore.com, please do your Christmas shopping there.

[55:46.000 --> 55:49.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, I hope we can stop the great reset.
[55:49.000 --> 55:54.000]  That means a globalist imposed worldwide depression to break us and bring us under their control.
[55:54.000 --> 55:59.000]  That's their state-admitted plan, Justin Trudeau's on record, Klaus Schwab, all the different Democrat mayors,
[55:59.000 --> 56:04.000]  they admit it's clowered in heaven, implode the economy to make us go under their control.
[56:04.000 --> 56:10.000]  But if we expose they're the ones doing it, they go to prison instead of getting total power and total control.
[56:10.000 --> 56:13.000]  And there are major uprisings happening across the world.
[56:13.000 --> 56:18.000]  Here in the US, thousands of sheriffs are saying hell no to the lockdowns, people are finally starting to fight back.
[56:18.000 --> 56:20.000]  But regardless, you need to get prepared.
[56:20.000 --> 56:27.000]  We have high quality swirable food last 25 years, highest quality, lowest prices, great containers, ready to ship.
[56:27.000 --> 56:34.000]  But when people figure this out in a few months, I think there'll be long lines again to get swirable food after the lockdown's been going for a few months.
[56:34.000 --> 56:40.000]  So get your orders in today at preparewithoutlux.com and get an additional 10% off and they're ready to ship.
[56:40.000 --> 56:50.000]  The sale ends next Wednesday or I guess that's December 2nd, so get your orders in now at preparewithoutlux.com.
[57:10.000 --> 57:17.000]  Preparewithout is the Fortune 100 corporations themselves funded by a handful of private central banking families.
[57:17.000 --> 57:22.000]  The Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, the Dutch and British royalty being at the very heart of that.
[57:22.000 --> 57:26.000]  Then you learn the Dutch and British royalty aren't even Dutch or British at the same time.
[57:26.000 --> 57:33.000]  But they go back to the literal count Dracula and the wars in between Christendom and Islam.
[57:33.000 --> 57:37.000]  Those that don't know history really are doomed to repeat it.
[57:37.000 --> 57:42.000]  They're involved in poting the world economy. That's what the social distancing the master are all about.
[57:42.000 --> 57:47.000]  It's about bankrupting local small businesses and those that comply are complying with your own destruction. Wake up.
[57:50.000 --> 57:53.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[57:53.000 --> 58:08.000]  All right, Robert Barnes, who again told me yesterday said, look at Texas is the big one.
[58:08.000 --> 58:11.000]  They had to get rid of Pennsylvania because it didn't have the right standing.
[58:11.000 --> 58:13.000]  Even it was a good suit.
[58:13.000 --> 58:15.000]  And now Trump's come out and said he will intervene in the Texas case.
[58:15.000 --> 58:17.000]  He will join with that.
[58:17.000 --> 58:18.000]  He says, this is the big one.
[58:18.000 --> 58:26.000]  Robert Barnes joins us in a moment. Let's just go back to this viral video of just some moms in the UK online.
[58:26.000 --> 58:30.000]  They've got the box for the approved MRNA.
[58:30.000 --> 58:37.000]  Regenetic engineers, mutation weapon that the fine print admits doesn't protect you from COVID.
[58:37.000 --> 58:40.000]  Doesn't stop it spread. That's all official.
[58:40.000 --> 58:44.000]  The trials they admit were lies. It doesn't protect you.
[58:44.000 --> 58:52.000]  But what does it do? They're stampeding you into sterilizing yourself and signing a consent form when you go get this.
[58:52.000 --> 58:56.000]  That you wave your liability because boy, they're hurting your ass.
[58:56.000 --> 59:00.000]  And again, it's so horrible what it does just from what scientists have looked at it.
[59:00.000 --> 59:06.000]  It can tell what similar vaccines do sterilize you, turn off your immune system, turn up your immune system.
[59:06.000 --> 59:11.000]  I was telling you yesterday, if you got allergy problems, you take this, it can kill you.
[59:11.000 --> 59:14.000]  Next day, don't take it if you have allergies, it will kill you.
[59:14.000 --> 59:17.000]  All I do is research this, okay?
[59:17.000 --> 59:22.000]  I'm not here making this up. And if I see extreme for fricking under military globalist attack
[59:22.000 --> 59:27.000]  and the militaries who they've been testing on and abusing with experimental stuff forever.
[59:27.000 --> 59:33.000]  So now they're using our military who mean well to go out and do the inoculations to intimidate the public into doing it.
[59:33.000 --> 59:39.000]  Perfect example of compartmentalization and how the oppressors are actually the most oppressed.
[59:39.000 --> 59:43.000]  God almighty. Let's go back to these women break it down.
[59:43.000 --> 59:48.000]  Everybody should be going to the drugstore, demanding the insert by law. They got to give it to you.
[59:48.000 --> 59:52.000]  The actual packaging. So you have informed consent. Here it is.
[59:52.000 --> 59:56.000]  AstraZeneca package. I just showed you this is their vaccine.
[59:56.000 --> 1:00:04.000]  And as they go down again, we use direct RNA sequencing to analyze transcript expression
[1:00:04.000 --> 1:00:10.000]  from the Chad's, let's call it the Chad vaccine genome in human MRC five.
[1:00:10.000 --> 1:00:15.000]  So you think to yourself, oh, let's get past that little bit complicated must be a bit scientific.
[1:00:15.000 --> 1:00:20.000]  No, look it up. And what do we find Claire when we look that up?
[1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:32.000]  MRC five is originally developed from research deriving lung tissue of a 14 week old aborted
[1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:38.000]  Caucasian male fetus. There you have it peaks.
[1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:47.000]  This COVID-19 vaccine that everybody is saying is going to save the world has a truckload of internet.
[1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:56.000]  But one thing it definitely has is the lung tissue of a 14 week old aborted Caucasian male fetus.
[1:00:56.000 --> 1:01:00.000]  It's been replicated over and over and over again for a long time.
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:06.000]  So you send this to every single Christian loving pro life person.
[1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  Forget the vaccine issue. Is everybody okay with having that injected into themselves or their children?
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:21.000]  It's utterly disgusting. So you share this and I'm just going to leave one more.
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:24.000]  So you're going to see one more thing before we go.
[1:01:24.000 --> 1:01:28.000]  This, this is what they want. I put this on our social media.
[1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:43.000]  I'm going to go and look at it. They're urgently seeking an artificial intelligence software tool to process the expected high volume of COVID-19 vaccine adverse drug reactions.
[1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:51.000]  They know that this vaccine is going to hurt people or kill people so badly.
[1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:54.000]  People it's in front of your face.
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:02:00.000]  Do your research. Rather than sharing this, try and grab it and make your own video of this.
[1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:04.000]  I don't know how you do it. I'm not technical because they will take this down.
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:12.000]  All right. We love you Pete. You're absolutely immensely loved. Pray big. Pray this out.
[1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:14.000]  Yes, God bless you.
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:20.000]  Now again, why is that going mega viral? Tens of millions of views here, millions of their Facebook, Twitter all taking it down.
[1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:27.000]  Because it's two mothers, Christians reading the damn insert. You can't let slaves do that. YouTube is banning that.
[1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:34.000]  You don't let slaves read that because they take out all the adverse reactions of the studies they funded on the emergency.
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:39.000]  Importantly, it's thousands of deaths in the studies. It's just, it's devastating weapon. Just devastating.
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:43.000]  And then they're going to start calling people to die. They're going to say they died of COVID-19.
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:45.000]  So this is if Hitler would have done this, he would have won.
[1:02:45.000 --> 1:02:49.000]  He did it with army tanks and fighter bombers. He lost because we stood up and fought back.
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:53.000]  If he did it as a medical operation, Hitler would have won. And they're coming for you and your family.
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:26.000]  We have their whole great catalog at infowarstore.com where you can normally get it at very good prices and those prices are still there.
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:36.000]  But an additional 10% off right now at preparewithoutlets.com on their one month, their three month or six month, their year and on a bunch of other great items.
[1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:43.000]  Huge discounts that will be ending next Wednesday. That is December 2nd.
[1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:49.000]  So you've got this week and a little bit of next week. Get your orders in. They're ready to ship to you right now.
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:52.000]  And the profit that comes in funds the info war. So it's a 360 win.
[1:03:52.000 --> 1:04:14.000]  It needs horrible food to fight the great reset. Get prepared now.
[1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  Stop tyranny will. So does he live from the info wars.com studios. It's Alex Jones.
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:31.000]  It is Wednesday, December 9th. The year is 2020. I am your host Alex Jones.
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:43.000]  And we're dialing in to get constitutional lawyer, advisor of the Republican Party, Robert Barnes on the line to give us the inside baseball on the fight for our constitutional Republic.
[1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:50.000]  And is Trump out? Is it Biden? Is the gaslighting accurate? Will they get away with the election theft? Here's some of the headlines.
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:05:02.000]  Fake deadlines top legal team exposes voter fraud says electoral college dates are arbitrary only Constitution matters. That's up on info wars.com.
[1:05:02.000 --> 1:05:07.000]  Supreme Court of the U.S. denies emergency injunction request from Pennsylvania case.
[1:05:07.000 --> 1:05:17.000]  But picks up the Texas case and will explain why here in a moment, but the media is totally covering up that fact.
[1:05:17.000 --> 1:05:23.000]  Meanwhile, YouTube to remove new videos that falsely claim fraud in the U.S. election.
[1:05:23.000 --> 1:05:29.000]  So the Democrats can say Russians ran it. Russians stole it with no evidence be proven to be fraud. They have their speech, which is fine.
[1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:37.000]  But now if we have all the evidence, all the proof dead people voting dead cats voting, we have all of that.
[1:05:37.000 --> 1:05:44.000]  Well, it's not allowed. That's because they're hiding the fact that the massive evidence as you've seen it here on air has come out.
[1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:54.000]  And because of band.video because of info wars.com because this outlet is here reaching more people than Newsmax, more people than OAN, more people than right side who I love.
[1:05:54.000 --> 1:06:04.000]  Do I support? I hope they get even bigger. They are trying to take us off air because they can't stand the truth coming out more than a month at the election.
[1:06:04.000 --> 1:06:08.000]  YouTube to remove misleading fraud claims. Oh, misleading. There's no fraud.
[1:06:08.000 --> 1:06:11.000]  We have a right to say you think there's fraud even though there wasn't.
[1:06:11.000 --> 1:06:17.000]  But there is YouTube to delete content that undermines 2020 U.S. election results.
[1:06:17.000 --> 1:06:24.000]  No, you can't undermine the results. That's all the Democrats did to Trump for year after year. Wow.
[1:06:24.000 --> 1:06:29.000]  Talk about election meddling. This is it. We have open court cases. We have legislators doing investigations.
[1:06:29.000 --> 1:06:34.000]  We have big tech censoring those findings and then information.
[1:06:34.000 --> 1:06:46.000]  YouTube will remove any new videos alleging Trump lost election because of fraud seen at. Oh, so if you say I think they stole it, you're not allowed to do that.
[1:06:46.000 --> 1:06:55.000]  Meanwhile, YouTube plans to survey creators on their race and use an algorithm to boost diverse communities and suppress the views of white males.
[1:06:55.000 --> 1:07:04.000]  I'm not kidding. Shocking. UPS whistleblower reveals FBI not interested in investigating voter fraud.
[1:07:04.000 --> 1:07:10.000]  And that they came and intimidated him to basically say nothing.
[1:07:10.000 --> 1:07:16.000]  Now, continuing. Trump also has another big lawsuit in Georgia.
[1:07:16.000 --> 1:07:25.000]  Highlights include 66,000 underage votes, 2,560 felons. That would throw it all out right there. Only lost by 13,000.
[1:07:25.000 --> 1:07:29.000]  And it goes on and on and on.
[1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:40.000]  But the big issue here is that Trump is now saying this is the big one concerning Texas vows to intervene in Texas Supreme Court case.
[1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:46.000]  So joining us constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes. He's been traveling the country behind the scenes working on what's happening.
[1:07:46.000 --> 1:07:51.000]  He's been very accurate behind the scenes, but now he's ready to break his silence on what would be unfolding.
[1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:55.000]  What was happening? He said that the Texas he agrees with Trump is the best case.
[1:07:55.000 --> 1:08:02.000]  He told us that this morning before this broke. And he's going to explain why they're going with Texas and not Pennsylvania.
[1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:08.000]  Is it about standing, Mr. Barnes, because having a state actually do it has a higher level of standing.
[1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:12.000]  More states can join and they can bring in evidence. Is that accurate?
[1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:21.000]  Yeah, that's part of it. I mean, effectively, it's who can challenge the electors clause provision for the violation of the electors clause provision.
[1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:28.000]  Nobody really better equipped to do that than the states because the states are the original parties to the constitutional contract.
[1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:37.000]  So the agreement was amongst the states for the resolution of any controversy involving the presidential election to go directly to the Supreme Court.
[1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:41.000]  They have original jurisdiction. You don't have to go through any other court at all.
[1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:47.000]  They actually are the trial court and the appeal court and the final court, all three in this context.
[1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:55.000]  And they have the strongest standing arguments because the whole purpose of the Constitution was, hey, we're going to agree when we pick the president,
[1:08:55.000 --> 1:09:00.000]  that all of us, all of our state sovereigns, we're going to agree to abide by the same set of rules.
[1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:06.000]  And what happened here is some states decided they weren't going to abide by those rules because they wanted to help Biden win.
[1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:14.000]  And it had the effect of Biden winning in their official certified vote because they decided to rig the rules.
[1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:19.000]  And the only remedy for the states is to go right to the U.S. Supreme Court.
[1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:22.000]  They have the strongest legal constitutional claim.
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:26.000]  And that is why the Trump has been building to this point for a while.
[1:09:26.000 --> 1:09:32.000]  It's just been kept under the under the radar scene for practical and political reasons.
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:35.000]  So it's going to be Texas versus the Democratic Party of Joe Biden.
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:38.000]  Exactly. And there's a bunch of states that are joining it.
[1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:44.000]  I think there's going to be 10, 11, 12, maybe you may ultimately have 20 states join it.
[1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:50.000]  Trump himself is joining it and the two big states of Texas and Florida having joined it were the critical components.
[1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:54.000]  So here you have like they were trying to take potshots at Paxton and other things.
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:09:56.000]  Many states are joining this claim.
[1:09:56.000 --> 1:10:04.000]  This is about whether our constitutional compact is going to be enforced or not because everybody agreed to the state legislatures would set the rules
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:08.000]  and any election would be done with due process and equal protection.
[1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:10.000]  A bunch of states decided they weren't going to do that.
[1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:18.000]  The states that have been sued are the main ones, but the ones that were very close where the illegal votes are greater than the margin of victory.
[1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:23.000]  What has been colloquially called the margin of fraud is in those states.
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:31.000]  And if those states had abided by the same set of rules they all agreed to at the time of the Constitution and moving forward, then Donald Trump is elected president.
[1:10:31.000 --> 1:10:32.000]  So that's the injury.
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:36.000]  And by the way, we'll start over next segment and give you the floor to walk through all this.
[1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:40.000]  But when the media says there's no proof of fraud, isn't that almost a red herring?
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:41.000]  There is proof of fraud.
[1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:47.000]  But the real evidence is they didn't have legislators passed laws to accept these 80 million ballots.
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:58.000]  They had secretary of states and governors meet with Clinton operatives and Obama operatives and Biden operatives and agree to law outside of law.
[1:10:58.000 --> 1:11:00.000]  So right there it's all thrown out.
[1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:05.000]  Exactly. The Constitution didn't say that the states could pick electors to the presidency.
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  It said only the state legislatures could pick electors to the presidency.
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  That was a deliberate choice that the state executive branch would have no role whatsoever in electing the president of the United States.
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:21.000]  Their sole role would be to enforce the laws and rules passed by the legislature.
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:30.000]  And what happened is a bunch of governors, a bunch of secretaries of state, sometimes just local election officials decided they weren't going to abide by the rules of the legislature.
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:31.000]  It's a simple power grab.
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:37.000]  So the legislators must stand up and reclaim their rights as they represent the people.
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  That's what should have been the remedy.
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:44.000]  However, the legislators believe that their only remedy is to go to the U.S. Supreme Court effectively.
[1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:47.000]  That's what they said in Georgia, Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania.
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:55.000]  A majority of the, or enough legislators said that they thought the only remedy was to go to effectively the Supreme Court.
[1:11:55.000 --> 1:11:58.000]  Did they politically plot because they were ignorant or because they were scared?
[1:11:58.000 --> 1:12:00.000]  I think a combination of the three.
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:04.000]  There is a legal argument that the appropriate remedy is the Supreme Court.
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:10.000]  So that's part of it because basically what they said was if there's ever a contest between the states about an election or anything else,
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:15.000]  the only court in the country that would have the power to decide the issue would be the Supreme Court.
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:18.000]  You can't file it anywhere else. You're not legally allowed to.
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:24.000]  Sure, it's the only system in the judiciary, but you can have the legislative take action at the state level.
[1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:27.000]  They're just not recognizing their power.
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:28.000]  That's part of it.
[1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  And there is a legal argument that they don't have that power.
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:39.000]  There's a legal argument that once they establish an election that they have to go to the Supreme Court if there's a dispute between them in another state or even within the state.
[1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:45.000]  Now, there's good arguments that they could assert that power in 1876. They clearly did.
[1:12:45.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  So there's conflicts about the degree to which they have that power.
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  There's also a federal statute that's on the books. That's a little bit of a problem.
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:13:03.000]  So the more effective legal remedy would be if the Supreme Court got involved because even if the legislature sent their own set of electors under existing federal law,
[1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:07.000]  there's an argument that those electors cannot count under a federal statute.
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:11.000]  So one way or the other, the Supreme Court was going to have to get involved.
[1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:15.000]  The only real remedy is ultimately with Congress.
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  But in order to give Congress sufficient cover to take action, they need the Supreme Court to give the president that cover.
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  Okay, Robert Barnes, we got you on a little bit late. We're glad you're here.
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:27.000]  We come back. Let's start over. Talk to me like I'm five years old.
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  The basics. Let's go through.
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:31.000]  Big picture. Does Trump have a chance?
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:33.000]  What are his odds? Let's just get down to brass tax.
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  Then let's zoom in on why the Texas case is king, why all the states are joining it, why Trump's joining it,
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:47.000]  and why the Pennsylvania was thrown to the side and how you expect us to unfold and what we the people can do to stop this globalist chai-com attempt at election theft.
[1:13:47.000 --> 1:14:03.000]  Robert Barnes is our guest. Stay with us.
[1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:24.000]  And now they've moved on to their main target to mad at me with the mRNA vaccines, which are not vaccines.
[1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  They are recombinant DNA from aborted cloned fetuses were then inserted into your genome to take over your body's systems.
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:40.000]  Go read the actual inserts for the mRNA vaccines.
[1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:42.000]  And then remember, you've been warned.
[1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:51.000]  This is the equivalent of an alien takeover. Whether it's interdimensional, whether it's little green men, the globalists are acting like another species that's overtaking us and overriding us.
[1:14:51.000 --> 1:15:20.000]  It's all the same in the end.
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:50.000]  Go to the local stations, call them, email them, and send them the link to info wars dot com forward slash affiliate and tell them we're free to answer them.
[1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:53.000]  We're free to air. No contracts. Just pick us up.
[1:16:20.000 --> 1:16:33.000]  And the question for Robert Barnes, a very established and respected and esteemed constitutional lawyer, one of the smartest historians I know, you can't fake knowledge.
[1:16:33.000 --> 1:16:37.000]  He's got it. He's been working very closely with some high level people.
[1:16:37.000 --> 1:16:39.000]  Leave it at that. Doesn't want to get into that.
[1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:41.000]  He's been all over the country very quietly. I've been talking to him.
[1:16:41.000 --> 1:16:43.000]  Everything he's told me has been dead on.
[1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:46.000]  He said, look for Pennsylvania to be thrown out.
[1:16:46.000 --> 1:16:47.000]  Look for Texas.
[1:16:47.000 --> 1:16:51.000]  Now there's a joint to be the big one. Use that term yesterday morning with me now.
[1:16:51.000 --> 1:16:54.000]  Trump says the big one today, joining the Texas thing.
[1:16:54.000 --> 1:17:02.000]  So Barnes, let's just go as a, as a patriot, you know, as an American as a constitutional lawyer.
[1:17:02.000 --> 1:17:08.000]  A lot of this is a confidence game, but we don't want to be like the left and say Joe Biden's the president Trump already lost.
[1:17:08.000 --> 1:17:12.000]  We know that's a fraud, but, but, but still, in my view, an uphill battle.
[1:17:12.000 --> 1:17:20.000]  Where is Trump really right now? And then we'll get into the technicals of this Texas case and where this is going and how this could unfold.
[1:17:20.000 --> 1:17:26.000]  The whole enchilada is the Texas case, but the Texas case by far gives him the best chance at real remedy and relief.
[1:17:26.000 --> 1:17:30.000]  Because the Supreme Court doesn't have to even say there was a lot of fraud.
[1:17:30.000 --> 1:17:32.000]  They don't have to get into a wide range of issues.
[1:17:32.000 --> 1:17:38.000]  All they have to decide is did these rogue states violate the electors clause.
[1:17:38.000 --> 1:17:45.000]  And if they did, what's the remedy? And the remedy is constitutionally is that it goes to the House to vote by state delegation.
[1:17:45.000 --> 1:17:50.000]  And if the Supreme Court directs that, then Trump wins the presidency end of story.
[1:17:50.000 --> 1:17:53.000]  Now the hurdle is, will the Supreme Court take action?
[1:17:53.000 --> 1:17:56.000]  There'll be a lot of political pressure on them not to take action.
[1:17:56.000 --> 1:17:59.000]  There'll be a lot of pressure from the press for them not to take action.
[1:17:59.000 --> 1:18:04.000]  So it's going to, it's going to totally depend on them because the other courts have turned a blind eye to this.
[1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:10.000]  They're not going to get involved. Too many of the Republican state legislators are weak to rely upon them.
[1:18:10.000 --> 1:18:15.000]  Even the Republican governors in states like Arizona and Georgia are not willing to step up to the plate.
[1:18:15.000 --> 1:18:17.000]  So it all comes down to the Supreme Court.
[1:18:17.000 --> 1:18:20.000]  Now ultimately he always has an option with Congress.
[1:18:20.000 --> 1:18:30.000]  Congress can decide not to certify the electors when there's such a contest as there is here and move forward and go with a vote by House delegation on their own accord.
[1:18:30.000 --> 1:18:36.000]  They don't have to depend on the Supreme Court for that, but they, but for the political for it to actually work.
[1:18:36.000 --> 1:18:41.000]  He really needs a Supreme Court to step in and say, hey, look, a bunch of states decided not to follow those rules.
[1:18:41.000 --> 1:18:51.000]  Everybody agreed by the consequence for that is your electors don't count and they can enjoy those electors all the way up until January 6th until Congress counts those electors.
[1:18:51.000 --> 1:18:54.000]  Whether the electors even meet on the 14th really doesn't matter.
[1:18:54.000 --> 1:19:02.000]  What matters is what who they certify in Congress on January 6th and the Supreme Court can act until, you know, a day before.
[1:19:02.000 --> 1:19:08.000]  I mean, 1876 they didn't decide the election contest until 48 hours before inauguration day.
[1:19:08.000 --> 1:19:11.000]  And that's back when inauguration day was in March.
[1:19:11.000 --> 1:19:19.000]  So the idea that we they we have to sit back and watch or sit back and wait or can only take action in certain circumstances really isn't the case.
[1:19:19.000 --> 1:19:24.000]  This Texas case is the strongest case for the president. It's why he joined the case. That's why he called it.
[1:19:24.000 --> 1:19:30.000]  They've been building to this moment because it's in the U.S. Supreme Court as an original action.
[1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:33.000]  Then they can the U.S. Supreme Court is the trial court.
[1:19:33.000 --> 1:19:36.000]  So what that means is they can hear evidence. They can take evidence.
[1:19:36.000 --> 1:19:39.000]  They can have evidence presented. They can have discovery.
[1:19:39.000 --> 1:19:44.000]  You got thrown out. Do you expect somebody like Cruz to come in over the Texas case?
[1:19:44.000 --> 1:19:51.000]  Cruz has already said that he is willing to help out. So I believe he may get involved in its packs in his lead.
[1:19:51.000 --> 1:19:56.000]  But there's a bunch of people involved. You know, the I would like to see Josh Holly in the Missouri Attorney General today,
[1:19:56.000 --> 1:19:59.000]  which is what Holly's position used to be before the United States Senate.
[1:19:59.000 --> 1:20:07.000]  They said they're going to join the suit. So you have Florida and Missouri and Arkansas and Louisiana and Alabama and Mississippi.
[1:20:07.000 --> 1:20:13.000]  So you have all these South Carolina and South Dakota, which has been the lead against the pandemic.
[1:20:13.000 --> 1:20:17.000]  And again, this is more than just the law, which is clearly on Trump's side.
[1:20:17.000 --> 1:20:21.000]  As you said, this is fraudulent. These 80 million ballots, it's all there by debate.
[1:20:21.000 --> 1:20:25.000]  All the rest of the problem when the prime of Asia original sin is there.
[1:20:25.000 --> 1:20:30.000]  But the media again creates this wall that oh, no, everyone wants Biden. He's really the president.
[1:20:30.000 --> 1:20:34.000]  Don't you dare do this? Well, no, we need to protest at the Supreme Court.
[1:20:34.000 --> 1:20:38.000]  We need to be in the streets this weekend in D.C. What do we need to do for the system?
[1:20:38.000 --> 1:20:42.000]  Put pressure on the states continue saying no, even if Joe Biden won, which he didn't do.
[1:20:42.000 --> 1:20:46.000]  He's a Chinese communist agent. We we do not accept him.
[1:20:46.000 --> 1:20:50.000]  They didn't accept Trump said he was a Russian agent with no proof. We have evidence here.
[1:20:50.000 --> 1:20:58.000]  We just explain we're never accepting Bible. What can we do to support the president and stop the gaslighting?
[1:20:58.000 --> 1:21:01.000]  Step one is get every attorney general to join this suit.
[1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:05.000]  So the in my view, every single one of them should join the suit.
[1:21:05.000 --> 1:21:14.000]  So where if you are in a state where your attorney general has not yet joined the suit or state hasn't joined the suit, demand that they do so.
[1:21:14.000 --> 1:21:16.000]  That's about election integrity.
[1:21:16.000 --> 1:21:21.000]  Anybody can just print out ballots and send them to Mickey Mouse if they want. We don't stop this.
[1:21:21.000 --> 1:21:24.000]  No doubt. Not only that, this is about the core of the constitutional accord.
[1:21:24.000 --> 1:21:32.000]  If states can ignore the electors clause provision, then anytime any place, the states can just decide to scratch the Constitution.
[1:21:32.000 --> 1:21:37.000]  The entire Constitution is gone if you can elect the president in an unconstitutional manner.
[1:21:37.000 --> 1:21:42.000]  Funny, it's Democrats again, violate the Constitution starting a civil war. I mean, that's really what they're doing.
[1:21:42.000 --> 1:21:50.000]  Oh, absolutely. That's what it is. I mean, it's the greatest threat to the constitutional accord since the civil war for states to come in and say, you know what?
[1:21:50.000 --> 1:21:56.000]  Yes, we agreed to abide by these rules, but screw you, we're not going to live by them. And that's what they did.
[1:21:56.000 --> 1:21:59.000]  And they did it across the board and they did it in cohorts in cahoots.
[1:21:59.000 --> 1:22:03.000]  And when the states told Eisenhower that black kids couldn't go to school, he marched the military in.
[1:22:03.000 --> 1:22:06.000]  People call it martial law, but I call it Declaration of Independence.
[1:22:06.000 --> 1:22:12.000]  If the states are being run by chai comms, if they're engaged in fraud, it's only a few leaders of it.
[1:22:12.000 --> 1:22:16.000]  What extraordinary, extrajudicial action does the president have?
[1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:21.000]  I think he's limited in that respect. I think he does need the Supreme Court to act.
[1:22:21.000 --> 1:22:28.000]  I think he does need Congress to act. He needs one of the two to act because given that state legislatures are not going to meaningfully act.
[1:22:28.000 --> 1:22:31.000]  I think any other remedy would be politically.
[1:22:31.000 --> 1:22:39.000]  Why is he bound by law if the Democrats and the chai comms aren't? I mean, once someone overturns the table and they declare their own fiat martial law,
[1:22:39.000 --> 1:22:45.000]  you're in a whole other universe. I mean, I get we're always playing within the Constitution. They've already gone outside of that.
[1:22:45.000 --> 1:22:52.000]  So what do you do? Like if Martians attacked, you know, we declare martial law. I mean, what do you do when something outside comes in?
[1:22:52.000 --> 1:22:58.000]  I still think you double down on democracy and the rule of law. And I think there's two reasons for that.
[1:22:58.000 --> 1:23:03.000]  One, you're establishing that as the precedent you're willing. You want to bind everyone else with so you're going to bind yourself to it.
[1:23:03.000 --> 1:23:11.000]  But secondly, I think just as a practical political matter, there's hurdles to him trying to take any. He doesn't have enough allies in the institutional process.
[1:23:11.000 --> 1:23:12.000]  That's the whole problem.
[1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:18.000]  No, but if he called the people out, if he called everybody out, we went, I mean, listen, if this wasn't Chinese backed, Bob, I'm not even calling for this.
[1:23:18.000 --> 1:23:25.000]  You know that I'm just hypothetically asking when they're stealing elections and engage their own blue state martial law with the lockdowns.
[1:23:25.000 --> 1:23:31.000]  I'm just saying how do we how do we counter the Democrats localized martial law? How do we how do we counter that?
[1:23:31.000 --> 1:23:35.000]  Well, I still think through populist reform and building up a stronger movement.
[1:23:35.000 --> 1:23:42.000]  I mean, because it in 1824 Andrew Jackson had it stolen from and made it created the great Jacksonian movement of 1828.
[1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:47.000]  So I think we continue to still use our Democratic remedies, little D Democratic remedy.
[1:23:47.000 --> 1:23:52.000]  I think you said this is only going to catapult if Trump doesn't act like a loser, which he's not.
[1:23:52.000 --> 1:23:55.000]  And if we don't take this as a loss, but it's our big victory, they had to steal.
[1:23:55.000 --> 1:23:57.000]  We only get more powerful.
[1:23:57.000 --> 1:24:01.000]  If like Nietzsche said, that which doesn't kill me only makes me stronger.
[1:24:01.000 --> 1:24:02.000]  Absolutely.
[1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:10.000]  I mean, what this election just exposed was that Trump did not have a deep enough, broad enough institutionalized network of populist supporters.
[1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:14.000]  He had not done as good a job as he needed to protecting them when they were under assault.
[1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:19.000]  Now he knows he needs to rebuild that network, build that structure to be stronger than ever before.
[1:24:19.000 --> 1:24:22.000]  And now he wants to get rid of Section 230. Now he wants to go out to the globalist.
[1:24:22.000 --> 1:24:25.000]  Now he's fire forged.
[1:24:25.000 --> 1:24:37.000]  Exactly. He realized this election exposed core problems that we have that can only really be overcome by building a broad populist revolution of a kind that led to the Revolution.
[1:24:37.000 --> 1:24:40.000]  Andrew, let's talk about that broad populist coalition.
[1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:44.000]  There's a lot of Democrats don't like this as well. Robert Barnes, we come back at Revisionary.
[1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:46.000]  I'm Alex Jones, infowars.com.
[1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:51.000]  Tomorrow's News Today, infowars.com.
[1:24:51.000 --> 1:24:55.000]  Webster's Dictionary has a very simple definition of terrorism.
[1:24:55.000 --> 1:24:57.000]  Other dictionaries have similar ones.
[1:24:57.000 --> 1:25:05.000]  Terrorism is the threat of force or actually carrying out force for a political or financial reason.
[1:25:05.000 --> 1:25:09.000]  It's basically scaring the hell out of people until you submit to them.
[1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:12.000]  That's exactly what all this overblown COVID-19 garbage is.
[1:25:12.000 --> 1:25:17.000]  You see the headlines from CNN, ABC News. Doctors say it's worse than they ever thought.
[1:25:17.000 --> 1:25:20.000]  COVID more dumbest thing they could ever imagine.
[1:25:20.000 --> 1:25:26.000]  They told us that two and a half million people would be dead just eight months ago within three months.
[1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:31.000]  It's a quarter million if you count all of the people that died of other things.
[1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:36.000]  We're talking 96% had co-morbidity. These are real numbers. These are real facts.
[1:25:36.000 --> 1:25:41.000]  This is the chicken little event where we all run our houses, never come out and are taught we're not essential.
[1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:44.000]  All the big box stores in Amazon take over the planet.
[1:25:44.000 --> 1:25:51.000]  You could stand up against it. This is slavery. It is not something you could put up with and survive.
[1:25:51.000 --> 1:25:54.000]  The globalists have always been at war with the family and small businesses.
[1:25:54.000 --> 1:25:57.000]  They want control. They want domesticated slaves.
[1:25:57.000 --> 1:26:00.000]  That's the process that is taking place right now.
[1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:06.000]  When you shop at the big box stores and when you shop with Amazon, remember that they are creating monopolies
[1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:12.000]  and they are the globalists that are pushing the lockdowns, gun control, abortion, world government, all of it.
[1:26:12.000 --> 1:26:14.000]  If you want to do that, go ahead and shop there.
[1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:20.000]  But if you'll shop at InfoWars where we have thousands of products made right here in America with our warehouses and our crew,
[1:26:20.000 --> 1:26:23.000]  it's incredible and it changes the whole world.
[1:26:23.000 --> 1:26:26.000]  So do your shopping if you want to fund the InfoWars.
[1:26:26.000 --> 1:26:31.000]  Or if you want to stop the globalist at InfoWarsStore.com and tell others to do their shopping at InfoWars.com.
[1:26:31.000 --> 1:26:37.000]  We have amazing products. We can get everything delivered to you by Christmas if you order by the 18th.
[1:26:37.000 --> 1:26:39.000]  So again, I want to thank you all for your support.
[1:26:39.000 --> 1:26:43.000]  I want to thank you for thinking through what you do and where you spend your money and do your shopping
[1:26:43.000 --> 1:26:57.000]  and get great products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:15.000]  Now we see some propaganda like communist China bragging.
[1:27:15.000 --> 1:27:20.000]  Hey, we've done mRNA vaccines to make our soldiers Superman.
[1:27:20.000 --> 1:27:24.000]  That's a way to make it sexy that, hey, we're experimenting on our troops.
[1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:31.000]  We'll say the things that happened to our troops and thousands and thousands of die each time they tried a new experimental vaccine.
[1:27:31.000 --> 1:27:35.000]  I've talked to high-level folks inside the federal government and the state of Texas health department.
[1:27:35.000 --> 1:27:39.000]  They say, Alex, you know it hurts a lot of people. It's for a greater good.
[1:27:39.000 --> 1:27:44.000]  Well, that's not even true. And it violates the Geneva Convention, the Nuremberg Code, federal state law.
[1:27:44.000 --> 1:28:13.000]  This is violence being carried out against us by the military and we have a right to resist it with any means necessary.
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:43.000]  Alright, Robert Barnes is our guest. I'm Alex Jones, your host and we are living in totally insane times.
[1:28:43.000 --> 1:28:48.000]  We have a total criminal takeover. Trump said these ballots are fraudulent.
[1:28:48.000 --> 1:28:51.000]  He said they're going to wait and stuff the ballots with them. They got caught doing it.
[1:28:51.000 --> 1:28:59.000]  And instead of debating the fraud, which we've got incredible proof of, we just show the fact that they illegally violated state laws and didn't have a lot to do this.
[1:28:59.000 --> 1:29:08.000]  We're going to go back to Barnes and talk about Big Picture, how he sees us unfolding, if the Supreme Court does rule it goes back to the states.
[1:29:08.000 --> 1:29:14.000]  What happens, what do the states do then? This is just an incredible moment to be alive.
[1:29:14.000 --> 1:29:18.000]  It's just totally insane. I say go after Biden for being a Chinese agent.
[1:29:18.000 --> 1:29:24.000]  I say go after him for the Clintons and Bill Clinton confirmed at Epstein Island now and just this whole rotting group.
[1:29:24.000 --> 1:29:27.000]  I mean, how are they really going to put this Crip Keeper in?
[1:29:27.000 --> 1:29:31.000]  But separately, prostitutes have been sold out for about four months.
[1:29:31.000 --> 1:29:33.000]  It was selling out. I said, why is it selling out?
[1:29:33.000 --> 1:29:39.000]  Well, it's got vitamin D3. It's got zinc. It's got saupalmato. It's got a whole bunch of other essential vitamins and minerals.
[1:29:39.000 --> 1:29:43.000]  It's really a great, organic, high quality, multivitamin.
[1:29:43.000 --> 1:29:47.000]  And it's good for men. It's designed for men, but it works great for women, you know, women.
[1:29:47.000 --> 1:29:51.000]  It's good for all your glands. I know you don't have a prostate, but it's amazing.
[1:29:51.000 --> 1:30:04.000]  So yeah. It's great. All the way, Alec Morgan, why don't you have them?
[1:30:04.000 --> 1:30:08.000]  I mean, the Moisture Directorate is oeil strangers.
[1:30:08.000 --> 1:30:13.000]  because of LJ100, URI, Coma, Longfalilia,
[1:30:13.800 --> 1:30:16.600]  and all this other patented stuff extract
[1:30:16.600 --> 1:30:20.440]  is known for libido, stamina, just everything.
[1:30:20.440 --> 1:30:23.680]  It's a high quality top end product at a very low price.
[1:30:23.680 --> 1:30:25.320]  Out of the gates sold out for almost a year,
[1:30:25.320 --> 1:30:28.120]  it is 50% off at infowarstore.com.
[1:30:28.120 --> 1:30:30.800]  We've got the big Christmas specials kicked off now.
[1:30:30.800 --> 1:30:33.600]  If your order gets in, by the 18th,
[1:30:33.600 --> 1:30:35.160]  anywhere in the United States,
[1:30:35.160 --> 1:30:36.840]  you will get delivery before Christmas.
[1:30:36.840 --> 1:30:38.480]  And this is usually our big time of the year
[1:30:38.480 --> 1:30:41.160]  to fund ourselves for the next few months.
[1:30:41.160 --> 1:30:42.120]  And it's a weird paradox.
[1:30:42.120 --> 1:30:43.160]  We're bringing in less money now.
[1:30:43.160 --> 1:30:44.520]  We brought in last December
[1:30:44.520 --> 1:30:46.440]  with three or four times, five times the audience.
[1:30:46.440 --> 1:30:48.960]  So folks, we need your support.
[1:30:48.960 --> 1:30:50.440]  Plus, these are great products.
[1:30:50.440 --> 1:30:52.920]  We have amazing products like Turbo Force
[1:30:52.920 --> 1:30:56.560]  and Living Defense and Ultimate Grill Oil and Lung Clins.
[1:30:56.560 --> 1:30:59.880]  We've got sales from 25 to 60% off,
[1:30:59.880 --> 1:31:02.960]  free shipping, double-patria points
[1:31:02.960 --> 1:31:04.440]  at infowarstore.com.
[1:31:04.440 --> 1:31:07.040]  I wanna thank you all for your support, but please,
[1:31:07.040 --> 1:31:08.440]  please do your Christmas shopping with us
[1:31:08.440 --> 1:31:10.440]  if you're gonna do it and not with the globalists
[1:31:10.440 --> 1:31:12.200]  that are working against you and your family.
[1:31:12.200 --> 1:31:13.920]  Storeable food, ready to ship,
[1:31:13.920 --> 1:31:15.200]  water filtration, air filtration,
[1:31:15.200 --> 1:31:17.720]  highest quality, ready to ship, survival gear,
[1:31:17.720 --> 1:31:20.560]  so much more, infowarstore.com.
[1:31:20.560 --> 1:31:21.400]  Okay.
[1:31:22.440 --> 1:31:23.600]  By the way, the blocket pockets
[1:31:23.600 --> 1:31:26.160]  that the contact tracers don't track you,
[1:31:26.160 --> 1:31:28.920]  the hackers, all the rest of it, put your phone in it.
[1:31:28.920 --> 1:31:29.880]  You forget about it.
[1:31:29.880 --> 1:31:31.440]  That way it doesn't track your location.
[1:31:31.440 --> 1:31:33.480]  That was sold out for months.
[1:31:33.480 --> 1:31:35.280]  They're back in stock, discounted,
[1:31:35.280 --> 1:31:37.560]  the privacy pockets at infowarstore.com.
[1:31:37.560 --> 1:31:40.240]  All right, Barnes, points you wanna get into here
[1:31:40.240 --> 1:31:43.120]  about Big Picture, Trump's chances.
[1:31:43.120 --> 1:31:44.320]  Where do you think this is going?
[1:31:44.320 --> 1:31:46.120]  What does the deep state do?
[1:31:46.120 --> 1:31:49.960]  What's the process if Trump does override this fraud?
[1:31:49.960 --> 1:31:51.000]  What do you expect of them?
[1:31:51.000 --> 1:31:51.840]  This is crazy.
[1:31:53.160 --> 1:31:56.680]  So the Supreme Court, if they take the case and issue remedy,
[1:31:56.680 --> 1:31:59.840]  say that there was a violation, they have three options.
[1:31:59.840 --> 1:32:02.680]  They can tell the states to simply do a new election,
[1:32:02.680 --> 1:32:05.560]  but within the rules, they could actually do that.
[1:32:05.560 --> 1:32:06.920]  Now, it historically has never been done
[1:32:06.920 --> 1:32:08.800]  in the presidential context,
[1:32:08.800 --> 1:32:11.640]  but it has been done in almost every other election contest,
[1:32:11.640 --> 1:32:13.520]  including for federal office.
[1:32:13.520 --> 1:32:17.320]  And for Democrats, you may see complaining out there.
[1:32:17.320 --> 1:32:20.360]  In 2019, when there was a house race
[1:32:20.360 --> 1:32:22.680]  for the Fur Congress in North Carolina,
[1:32:22.680 --> 1:32:25.320]  and they just found a few fraudulent votes
[1:32:25.320 --> 1:32:27.480]  that nowhere near the margin of victory,
[1:32:27.480 --> 1:32:29.920]  they election commission and the Democrats demanded
[1:32:29.920 --> 1:32:31.160]  that they throw out the election
[1:32:31.160 --> 1:32:32.800]  and do an entirely new election.
[1:32:32.800 --> 1:32:34.040]  And that's what they did.
[1:32:34.040 --> 1:32:36.680]  Here we have far more illegal votes
[1:32:36.680 --> 1:32:38.000]  than the margin of victory.
[1:32:38.000 --> 1:32:39.320]  So that's one remedy.
[1:32:39.320 --> 1:32:40.640]  I don't think it's the most likely.
[1:32:40.640 --> 1:32:42.600]  The second remedy is they could send it back
[1:32:42.600 --> 1:32:44.160]  to the state legislatures,
[1:32:44.160 --> 1:32:48.440]  for the state legislatures to send a new slate of electors
[1:32:48.440 --> 1:32:52.960]  to the electoral college or to be certified to Congress
[1:32:52.960 --> 1:32:57.640]  by the January 6th deadline for them to read in the electors.
[1:32:57.640 --> 1:32:59.600]  The third option, and I think this is what
[1:32:59.600 --> 1:33:02.560]  the constitutional remedy really is,
[1:33:02.560 --> 1:33:04.000]  is that it simply goes to the house.
[1:33:04.000 --> 1:33:05.680]  The Supreme Court could say,
[1:33:05.680 --> 1:33:09.680]  we are hereby enjoining any certification of any electors
[1:33:09.680 --> 1:33:13.720]  from Pennsylvania or Michigan or Wisconsin or Georgia,
[1:33:13.720 --> 1:33:15.480]  because they did not follow the rules
[1:33:15.480 --> 1:33:18.200]  that everybody agreed to live by.
[1:33:18.200 --> 1:33:20.200]  These are like referees, middle of the game,
[1:33:20.200 --> 1:33:21.720]  trying to rewrite the rules,
[1:33:21.720 --> 1:33:22.960]  when they didn't even have the authority
[1:33:22.960 --> 1:33:25.120]  to write the rules in the first place.
[1:33:25.120 --> 1:33:27.600]  And so consequently, it has to go to the house
[1:33:27.600 --> 1:33:30.120]  and they vote by state delegation,
[1:33:30.120 --> 1:33:34.200]  where Republicans have at least a four state edge.
[1:33:34.200 --> 1:33:35.840]  Depending on how certain elections,
[1:33:35.840 --> 1:33:37.000]  if there's an argument, they actually have a seven state.
[1:33:37.000 --> 1:33:39.360]  So why would Republicans not fight this?
[1:33:39.360 --> 1:33:40.440]  I mean, when Trump says,
[1:33:40.440 --> 1:33:42.360]  oh, they're gonna be really upset in a few days,
[1:33:42.360 --> 1:33:44.760]  this is the right course, it's the constitutional remedy.
[1:33:44.760 --> 1:33:47.120]  We have the ridiculous proof of the fraud
[1:33:47.120 --> 1:33:50.360]  that gives the political cover for Republicans
[1:33:50.360 --> 1:33:51.200]  to do the right thing
[1:33:51.200 --> 1:33:53.000]  and not let a Chinese communist agent
[1:33:53.000 --> 1:33:54.680]  gang rape our voting rights.
[1:33:54.680 --> 1:33:58.680]  Exactly, it's the logical remedy for Congress to take.
[1:33:58.680 --> 1:34:02.320]  And so if the Supreme Court does not take action,
[1:34:02.320 --> 1:34:04.760]  then the possibility is that the house in the Senate,
[1:34:04.760 --> 1:34:06.440]  there still could be remedy for the president.
[1:34:06.440 --> 1:34:09.040]  The house under their internal rules,
[1:34:09.040 --> 1:34:11.400]  if a house member and a senator object
[1:34:11.400 --> 1:34:13.720]  to the electoral college votes from any state.
[1:34:13.720 --> 1:34:14.920]  And there's already a house member
[1:34:14.920 --> 1:34:17.320]  that's introduced this, as you know.
[1:34:17.320 --> 1:34:20.200]  Exactly, there's a guarantee house member to object.
[1:34:20.200 --> 1:34:22.840]  The only question has been whether a senator joins it.
[1:34:22.840 --> 1:34:25.600]  And by the way, there's a good constitutional argument
[1:34:25.600 --> 1:34:28.080]  that whether or not there's contested electors
[1:34:28.080 --> 1:34:31.520]  should also be decided by the house by state delegation.
[1:34:31.520 --> 1:34:34.360]  This law they passed in 1887 that requires the house
[1:34:34.360 --> 1:34:36.520]  and the Senate to separately meet
[1:34:36.520 --> 1:34:39.200]  and separately object and join in an objection
[1:34:39.200 --> 1:34:40.840]  is likely not constitutional
[1:34:40.840 --> 1:34:43.440]  according to a wide number of legal scholars.
[1:34:43.440 --> 1:34:44.280]  In fact-
[1:34:44.280 --> 1:34:45.120]  Well, let's go further.
[1:34:45.120 --> 1:34:46.520]  Did you see this thing where Pelosi
[1:34:46.520 --> 1:34:49.160]  is declaring some act they used in 1986
[1:34:49.160 --> 1:34:52.360]  that she says the 15 house wins by Republicans
[1:34:52.360 --> 1:34:53.880]  aren't legitimate with no evidence
[1:34:53.880 --> 1:34:56.880]  and that she's gonna have the house vote to overturn those
[1:34:56.880 --> 1:34:58.640]  and give it to Democrats, as you see that.
[1:34:58.640 --> 1:35:00.680]  So they're saying Trump can't challenge things,
[1:35:00.680 --> 1:35:03.320]  but she's gonna overturn other elections.
[1:35:03.320 --> 1:35:04.840]  Well, in fact, yes, he's looking at it right now.
[1:35:04.840 --> 1:35:07.840]  She's looking at overturning one of the Iowa House elections.
[1:35:07.840 --> 1:35:09.520]  In upstate New York, they're looking at whether
[1:35:09.520 --> 1:35:11.760]  that will end up going to the House of Representatives.
[1:35:11.760 --> 1:35:15.600]  So if it's good enough for a contested congressional race
[1:35:15.600 --> 1:35:17.160]  to go to the house,
[1:35:17.160 --> 1:35:20.120]  even where they've certified a Republican winner,
[1:35:20.120 --> 1:35:23.400]  then why isn't it good enough when the Constitution calls
[1:35:23.400 --> 1:35:26.280]  for presidential election contest to go to the house
[1:35:26.280 --> 1:35:29.240]  by state delegation, not majority vote?
[1:35:29.240 --> 1:35:31.040]  That's the way it should go.
[1:35:31.040 --> 1:35:33.320]  And there may be legal challenges down the road
[1:35:33.320 --> 1:35:35.600]  by Congressman Gosar, maybe some others
[1:35:35.600 --> 1:35:36.880]  who are looking at it,
[1:35:36.880 --> 1:35:39.640]  about whether or not any contested election issue
[1:35:39.640 --> 1:35:42.920]  should go solely to the house to vote by state delegation,
[1:35:42.920 --> 1:35:45.240]  not go to both halls of Congress,
[1:35:45.240 --> 1:35:47.000]  not go to a majority vote,
[1:35:47.000 --> 1:35:49.160]  because the 12th Amendment doesn't call for that.
[1:35:49.160 --> 1:35:51.200]  The 12th Amendment says the house votes
[1:35:51.200 --> 1:35:54.560]  by state delegation any time there's a contested issue
[1:35:54.560 --> 1:35:55.400]  involving the presidential election.
[1:35:55.400 --> 1:35:56.280]  What else does Trump mean to do?
[1:35:56.280 --> 1:35:59.280]  I think it needs to be at the resolute desk every night
[1:35:59.280 --> 1:36:01.240]  showing the graph, showing the evidence,
[1:36:01.240 --> 1:36:03.680]  rallying the people saying that he is the president.
[1:36:03.680 --> 1:36:04.560]  He's not giving up,
[1:36:04.560 --> 1:36:07.400]  because only he can punch through the gaslighting
[1:36:07.400 --> 1:36:09.440]  of even Google and Twitter saying,
[1:36:09.440 --> 1:36:11.640]  no one is allowed to say there's fraud.
[1:36:11.640 --> 1:36:13.800]  They're even censoring legislative hearings.
[1:36:13.800 --> 1:36:15.280]  I mean, this is insane.
[1:36:16.200 --> 1:36:17.040]  No doubt.
[1:36:17.040 --> 1:36:17.880]  I think the president needs to continue
[1:36:17.880 --> 1:36:19.200]  to work the court of public opinion
[1:36:19.200 --> 1:36:20.560]  on what happened in the election,
[1:36:20.560 --> 1:36:23.120]  but he needs to do what he's also been doing,
[1:36:23.120 --> 1:36:25.160]  which is to let the deep state know
[1:36:25.160 --> 1:36:27.400]  that he understands what happened in this election,
[1:36:27.400 --> 1:36:29.920]  and he's gonna use all of his presidential power,
[1:36:29.920 --> 1:36:32.440]  whether he's there after January 20th or not,
[1:36:32.440 --> 1:36:33.680]  between now and then,
[1:36:33.680 --> 1:36:35.160]  use all of his presidential power
[1:36:35.160 --> 1:36:36.240]  to gut the deep state.
[1:36:36.240 --> 1:36:37.080]  I was about to say,
[1:36:37.080 --> 1:36:39.440]  isn't a rebel Trump almost more dangerous
[1:36:39.440 --> 1:36:40.640]  than a president Trump?
[1:36:40.640 --> 1:36:42.880]  Do you imagine this would be like?
[1:36:42.880 --> 1:36:45.280]  Absolutely, that's his point to deep state actors.
[1:36:45.280 --> 1:36:46.760]  That's why right after he realized
[1:36:46.760 --> 1:36:47.880]  what happened in the election,
[1:36:47.880 --> 1:36:49.760]  he starts withdrawing troops from Somalia,
[1:36:49.760 --> 1:36:52.720]  withdrawing troops from Afghanistan,
[1:36:52.720 --> 1:36:54.760]  ordering them coming back home from Syria.
[1:36:54.760 --> 1:36:56.440]  So he's accelerating that.
[1:36:56.440 --> 1:36:57.440]  I hope he goes further.
[1:36:57.440 --> 1:36:58.960]  He already pardoned General Flynn.
[1:36:58.960 --> 1:37:01.200]  I hope he wants those troops here in case he needs them.
[1:37:01.200 --> 1:37:04.040]  I mean, you know that Trump's been looking at,
[1:37:04.040 --> 1:37:06.320]  they try some type of domestic military action
[1:37:06.320 --> 1:37:08.080]  against the executive branch.
[1:37:09.960 --> 1:37:12.040]  Oh, he has to be prepared for that contingency.
[1:37:12.040 --> 1:37:14.600]  The other thing he should do is pardon all of his allies.
[1:37:14.600 --> 1:37:16.400]  Pardon Julian Assange.
[1:37:16.400 --> 1:37:18.000]  Pardon Ed Snowden.
[1:37:18.000 --> 1:37:19.400]  Those would be two great acts.
[1:37:19.400 --> 1:37:22.120]  The removal of Julian Assange from this election
[1:37:22.120 --> 1:37:23.760]  helped Biden tremendously.
[1:37:23.760 --> 1:37:27.360]  So to be able to have those people back on the playing field
[1:37:27.360 --> 1:37:30.320]  to help fight deep state apparatus around the world.
[1:37:30.320 --> 1:37:31.160]  So hopefully-
[1:37:31.160 --> 1:37:32.160]  So you're known as the guy
[1:37:32.160 --> 1:37:34.000]  that won the most money ever on Trump.
[1:37:34.000 --> 1:37:36.720]  We come back, I wanna ask you the real odds currently
[1:37:36.720 --> 1:37:38.880]  on where you think this election stands
[1:37:38.880 --> 1:37:40.560]  42 days out from inauguration.
[1:37:40.560 --> 1:37:43.040]  Then we'll look at the big COVID lockdown
[1:37:43.040 --> 1:37:44.840]  and these new drugs they call vaccines
[1:37:44.840 --> 1:37:46.480]  that you've been really exposing.
[1:37:46.480 --> 1:37:47.920]  Robert Barnes is our guest.
[1:37:50.680 --> 1:37:54.440]  If you think 2020 has been an insane and dangerous year,
[1:37:54.440 --> 1:37:57.760]  just wait until you see the year 2021.
[1:37:57.760 --> 1:37:58.920]  I'm Alex Jones.
[1:37:58.920 --> 1:37:59.920]  I started in full wars,
[1:37:59.920 --> 1:38:02.360]  but I couldn't have done any of this without you.
[1:38:02.360 --> 1:38:04.520]  And now in full wars is more important than ever
[1:38:04.520 --> 1:38:07.040]  because the general population of the planet
[1:38:07.040 --> 1:38:09.160]  is waking up the fact that we've done our research
[1:38:09.160 --> 1:38:10.440]  and we've been dead on.
[1:38:10.440 --> 1:38:13.120]  That's why it's so important for those of you out there
[1:38:13.120 --> 1:38:15.200]  that have supported the broadcast and the websites
[1:38:15.200 --> 1:38:17.240]  and the films and all the rest of the information
[1:38:17.240 --> 1:38:20.040]  we put out to realize how important your work has been
[1:38:20.040 --> 1:38:21.320]  and to redouble your efforts.
[1:38:21.320 --> 1:38:22.760]  So I salute you and I thank you.
[1:38:22.760 --> 1:38:25.000]  Also, as Christmas is almost here,

[1:38:46.600 --> 1:38:48.160]  And again, thank you all for your support
[1:38:48.160 --> 1:38:49.840]  and Merry Christmas, God bless.
[1:38:49.840 --> 1:38:52.280]  There is an economic war taking place
[1:38:52.280 --> 1:38:55.600]  of the ruling class to consolidate power and control.
[1:38:55.600 --> 1:38:57.160]  There's a headline out from zero hedge
[1:38:57.160 --> 1:38:58.560]  that breaks down Bloomberg numbers
[1:38:58.560 --> 1:39:03.560]  that global airlines are set to lose $157 billion
[1:39:03.560 --> 1:39:05.440]  this year by the end of December.
[1:39:05.440 --> 1:39:08.640]  It's already over $130 billion they've lost.
[1:39:08.640 --> 1:39:11.640]  Why would they take part in the hoax,
[1:39:11.640 --> 1:39:14.600]  in the lockdown, in the hysteria, if it hurts them?
[1:39:14.600 --> 1:39:16.920]  We'll see, that'll knock out all the small airlines
[1:39:16.920 --> 1:39:17.920]  and it's all they control.
[1:39:17.920 --> 1:39:20.200]  And it's the same in every single industry.
[1:39:20.200 --> 1:39:22.400]  And the big megabanks have unlimited capital.
[1:39:22.400 --> 1:39:24.200]  They want to bankrupt the world economy
[1:39:24.200 --> 1:39:27.000]  until they buy it up for pennies on the dollar.
[1:39:27.000 --> 1:39:29.880]  That's why the great stock market crash of 29 later turned out
[1:39:29.880 --> 1:39:31.520]  was engineered by some central banks.
[1:39:31.520 --> 1:39:34.680]  This is how the globalists take control.
[1:39:34.680 --> 1:39:36.560]  It stars the third world to death,
[1:39:36.560 --> 1:39:38.120]  makes the first world poor,
[1:39:38.120 --> 1:39:39.760]  makes economic warfare,
[1:39:39.760 --> 1:39:41.360]  and it gives cover to the big megabanks
[1:39:41.360 --> 1:39:44.200]  that created thousands of trillions of dollars
[1:39:44.200 --> 1:39:45.480]  in fake derivatives.
[1:39:45.480 --> 1:39:47.320]  Only the truth will set us free.
[1:39:47.320 --> 1:39:48.520]  Infowars.com.
[1:39:51.040 --> 1:39:54.080]  I've got some really exciting good news
[1:39:54.080 --> 1:39:56.040]  and I've also got some bad news.
[1:39:56.040 --> 1:39:58.640]  Infowars is getting the highest traffic
[1:39:58.640 --> 1:40:03.200]  we have ever gotten since the election in 2016.
[1:40:03.200 --> 1:40:05.840]  Despite all the bans, all of the system
[1:40:05.840 --> 1:40:07.600]  trying to censor us and suppress us,
[1:40:07.600 --> 1:40:10.280]  you with your word of mouth have overwritten that
[1:40:10.280 --> 1:40:13.120]  and they are so scared of Infowars.com and banned on video
[1:40:13.120 --> 1:40:15.320]  and they're so scared of you being able to communicate
[1:40:15.320 --> 1:40:16.520]  and share the truth.
[1:40:16.520 --> 1:40:19.200]  But we're bringing in the same amount of money
[1:40:19.200 --> 1:40:21.280]  we brought in last December right now.
[1:40:21.280 --> 1:40:22.600]  This is our most important month
[1:40:22.600 --> 1:40:24.880]  to be able to fund ourselves in the next year.
[1:40:24.880 --> 1:40:26.440]  And I understand the economy is shut down.
[1:40:26.440 --> 1:40:28.280]  I understand there's not as much money as there used to be.
[1:40:28.280 --> 1:40:29.760]  They're trying to kill Trump's recovery.
[1:40:29.760 --> 1:40:31.960]  But Infowars really needs your support.
[1:40:31.960 --> 1:40:33.440]  You just buy great items
[1:40:33.440 --> 1:40:35.800]  through your Christmas shopping and Infowars.com
[1:40:35.800 --> 1:40:37.880]  with huge sales, amazing products
[1:40:37.880 --> 1:40:39.760]  and then you know you're funding the Infowar
[1:40:39.760 --> 1:40:41.880]  and not funding Amazon and Jeff Bezos
[1:40:41.880 --> 1:40:43.560]  and the globalists that are openly trying
[1:40:43.560 --> 1:40:44.800]  to destroy small businesses.
[1:40:44.800 --> 1:40:47.080]  Continue to fund the Second American Revolution
[1:40:47.080 --> 1:40:48.720]  while getting great products at the same time
[1:40:48.720 --> 1:40:50.000]  at Infowarsstore.com.
[1:40:50.000 --> 1:40:51.480]  Thank you.
[1:40:51.480 --> 1:40:54.720]  Fox has betrayed President Trump as I predicted they would.
[1:40:54.720 --> 1:40:57.200]  They've always been part of the establishment
[1:40:57.200 --> 1:40:58.920]  and it's only going to get worse.
[1:40:58.920 --> 1:41:02.160]  If they're able to keep Trump from rightfully taking office
[1:41:02.160 --> 1:41:04.680]  for second term on January 20th,
[1:41:04.680 --> 1:41:07.560]  the system is going to drop the hammer harder than ever
[1:41:07.560 --> 1:41:08.400]  on this Republic.
[1:41:08.400 --> 1:41:10.400]  They are going to explode gas prices.
[1:41:10.400 --> 1:41:12.520]  They're going to shut down our coal power plants.
[1:41:12.520 --> 1:41:14.840]  They're going to cut off the energy source to the US.
[1:41:14.840 --> 1:41:17.600]  So it's impossible for factories to move back here.
[1:41:17.600 --> 1:41:19.200]  This is economic domination.
[1:41:19.200 --> 1:41:20.520]  This is economic war.
[1:41:20.520 --> 1:41:21.560]  We are being consolidated.
[1:41:21.560 --> 1:41:22.800]  We are being taken over.
[1:41:22.800 --> 1:41:24.520]  The Democrats aren't mismanaging
[1:41:24.520 --> 1:41:26.160]  their blue cities and states.
[1:41:26.160 --> 1:41:28.120]  They're consolidating power and control
[1:41:28.120 --> 1:41:31.880]  to bankrupt the population and bring them absolutely to heal
[1:41:31.880 --> 1:41:34.440]  and then consolidate ownership of all the infrastructure
[1:41:34.440 --> 1:41:35.440]  and property.
[1:41:35.440 --> 1:41:37.360]  This is a monopolistic takeover.
[1:41:37.360 --> 1:41:39.040]  That's what the great reset is.
[1:41:39.040 --> 1:41:41.640]  Klaus Schwab and these other criminals admit it.
[1:41:41.640 --> 1:41:43.240]  That's what social distancing is.
[1:41:43.240 --> 1:41:46.640]  So your business is only at 25% for several more years.
[1:41:46.640 --> 1:41:48.880]  No small businesses will be there.
[1:41:48.880 --> 1:41:50.000]  This is a master plan.
[1:41:50.000 --> 1:41:50.500]  Say no.
[1:41:50.500 --> 1:42:02.500]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:42:02.500 --> 1:42:24.980]  All right, Robert Barnes is our gas constitutional lawyer
[1:42:24.980 --> 1:42:28.540]  working on these cases.
[1:42:28.540 --> 1:42:29.580]  Texas is the big one.
[1:42:29.580 --> 1:42:32.380]  All these states are joining the Texas case.
[1:42:32.380 --> 1:42:36.020]  Where they're saying, look, all these ballots are fake.
[1:42:36.020 --> 1:42:37.340]  It violated state law.
[1:42:37.340 --> 1:42:39.180]  Why are we even debating whether it was fraud or not?
[1:42:39.180 --> 1:42:39.980]  Of course it was fraud.
[1:42:39.980 --> 1:42:41.100]  We've got all the evidence.
[1:42:41.100 --> 1:42:43.140]  That's the political will.
[1:42:43.140 --> 1:42:45.540]  But now it was done illegally.
[1:42:45.540 --> 1:42:47.860]  And the Democrats said they were going to contest the election
[1:42:47.860 --> 1:42:51.300]  no matter what happened if they thought Trump won.
[1:42:51.300 --> 1:42:53.900]  Now they say, oh, no, we've got to accept Biden.
[1:42:53.900 --> 1:42:55.300]  People really see through that.
[1:42:55.300 --> 1:42:57.660]  The mainstream media is a rotten edifice.
[1:42:57.660 --> 1:43:00.220]  But the problem is so many of the members of Congress,
[1:43:00.220 --> 1:43:02.540]  the legislatures are 70, 80 years old.
[1:43:02.540 --> 1:43:03.980]  They still believe mainstream media.
[1:43:03.980 --> 1:43:06.060]  They don't get for everybody below 50.
[1:43:06.060 --> 1:43:07.660]  It means nothing.
[1:43:07.660 --> 1:43:09.340]  So any other closing comments on that?
[1:43:09.340 --> 1:43:11.260]  And let's get into the big issue here.
[1:43:11.260 --> 1:43:12.900]  I think one of Trump's big failings
[1:43:12.900 --> 1:43:14.300]  going along with the quote, vaccine.
[1:43:14.300 --> 1:43:15.540]  Well, he thinks it's a normal vaccine.
[1:43:15.540 --> 1:43:16.900]  It's not the mRNA.
[1:43:16.900 --> 1:43:20.540]  As you pointed out, it's not a vaccine at all.
[1:43:20.540 --> 1:43:24.500]  Now we're learning that it can attack the placenta.
[1:43:24.500 --> 1:43:27.020]  Top sign is saying it's a sterilant.
[1:43:27.020 --> 1:43:28.540]  So just anything else on the election,
[1:43:28.540 --> 1:43:31.260]  then let's get in to the ongoing lockdown,
[1:43:31.260 --> 1:43:34.340]  the societal takeover, and how we counter that.
[1:43:34.340 --> 1:43:35.780]  Well, the best chance the president has
[1:43:35.780 --> 1:43:37.940]  is this Texas suit that's been really well-crafted
[1:43:37.940 --> 1:43:38.980]  and well-drafted.
[1:43:38.980 --> 1:43:41.100]  The big question is whether the courts,
[1:43:41.100 --> 1:43:43.540]  whether the Supreme Court, and whether ultimately Congress,
[1:43:43.540 --> 1:43:46.340]  has the courage to uphold the Constitution
[1:43:46.340 --> 1:43:49.180]  in the midst of this incredible crisis.
[1:43:49.180 --> 1:43:51.220]  The other lesson of this election
[1:43:51.220 --> 1:43:54.420]  is that we need to build, and that Trump now fully understands,
[1:43:54.420 --> 1:43:58.060]  he needs to build, a broad populist movement that
[1:43:58.060 --> 1:44:02.020]  is institutionalized support, and that he protects his allies,
[1:44:02.020 --> 1:44:05.100]  doesn't allow his allies to get sacrificed the way Flynn did,
[1:44:05.100 --> 1:44:07.180]  the way Assange did, the way, frankly, Infowars
[1:44:07.180 --> 1:44:11.260]  partially did at the template of the big tech censorship,
[1:44:11.260 --> 1:44:14.220]  that we are now seeing extended to the election, where
[1:44:14.220 --> 1:44:17.020]  you're not even allowed to talk about the election on YouTube
[1:44:17.020 --> 1:44:20.780]  as of today if they don't like what you say.
[1:44:20.780 --> 1:44:24.460]  So it shows the need for longstanding real reform.
[1:44:24.460 --> 1:44:25.620]  And that can only come about.
[1:44:25.620 --> 1:44:29.300]  But I see it as not as an obstacle, but as an opportunity.
[1:44:29.300 --> 1:44:31.340]  Regardless of what happens in this election,
[1:44:31.340 --> 1:44:37.020]  we should use it as fire to build a real populist movement
[1:44:37.020 --> 1:44:38.980]  the way Jacksonian America could only
[1:44:38.980 --> 1:44:43.980]  happen because of the 1824 election being stolen from him.
[1:44:43.980 --> 1:44:45.940]  He built a real populist movement
[1:44:45.940 --> 1:44:49.060]  with depth and length that was as much about a movement
[1:44:49.060 --> 1:44:52.140]  as it was about a man that lasted for 40 years
[1:44:52.140 --> 1:44:54.700]  and to some degree lasted for 200 years.
[1:44:54.700 --> 1:44:56.580]  And Trump has made the model of what he's
[1:44:56.580 --> 1:44:58.940]  done as a rebel maverick.
[1:44:58.940 --> 1:45:03.100]  So history really does repeat itself yet again.
[1:45:03.100 --> 1:45:06.660]  So Robert Barnes, pulling back from this,
[1:45:06.660 --> 1:45:09.940]  what do you think the deep state is
[1:45:09.940 --> 1:45:12.540]  going to do if they're able to get Biden in?
[1:45:12.540 --> 1:45:16.180]  I expect them to just go whole hog to bankrupt the economy,
[1:45:16.180 --> 1:45:18.780]  bring in the universal credit score,
[1:45:18.780 --> 1:45:20.140]  bring in the social credit score,
[1:45:20.140 --> 1:45:24.460]  bring in the universal income to fully break our back.
[1:45:24.460 --> 1:45:25.460]  I think it's two things.
[1:45:25.460 --> 1:45:27.860]  One, you're going to see wars all over the place.
[1:45:27.860 --> 1:45:29.860]  The deep state has had to set up the sidelines
[1:45:29.860 --> 1:45:32.620]  and not engage and expand war for the first time
[1:45:32.620 --> 1:45:34.940]  in a very long time under Trump.
[1:45:34.940 --> 1:45:37.340]  And so if Biden is in, expect to see.
[1:45:37.340 --> 1:45:39.100]  I mean, Susan Rance is already talking
[1:45:39.100 --> 1:45:40.900]  about going into Ethiopia.
[1:45:40.900 --> 1:45:43.700]  I mean, so we're going to see a broad expansion
[1:45:43.700 --> 1:45:46.940]  of the military war footprint of the empire mindset
[1:45:46.940 --> 1:45:48.060]  and mentality.
[1:45:48.060 --> 1:45:50.300]  We'll be back in the Middle East again.
[1:45:50.300 --> 1:45:53.020]  We'll probably be back somewhere in Central Europe again.
[1:45:53.020 --> 1:45:55.380]  And they'll find new places in Africa, Latin America
[1:45:55.380 --> 1:45:56.620]  to get involved in.
[1:45:56.620 --> 1:45:57.580]  That'll be part one.
[1:45:57.580 --> 1:46:00.180]  Part two is they'll probably go to bed,
[1:46:00.180 --> 1:46:03.460]  go into bed with China rather than be at odds with China.
[1:46:03.460 --> 1:46:05.220]  So that will be the other major shift
[1:46:05.220 --> 1:46:06.940]  where they're basically shifting economic,
[1:46:06.940 --> 1:46:09.660]  political, cultural power from the United States
[1:46:09.660 --> 1:46:10.980]  and the West to China.
[1:46:10.980 --> 1:46:12.780]  And I think that's the next big,
[1:46:12.780 --> 1:46:16.540]  the true next great reset is resetting power,
[1:46:16.540 --> 1:46:19.500]  the power equilibrium to put China more into control.
[1:46:19.500 --> 1:46:21.740]  And that's our next great fight.
[1:46:21.740 --> 1:46:23.180]  No, I totally agree.
[1:46:23.180 --> 1:46:25.100]  Can you imagine if Trump was literally in bed
[1:46:25.100 --> 1:46:27.460]  with the Russians saying, I take orders from Russia,
[1:46:27.460 --> 1:46:29.780]  getting money from Russia, like they said.
[1:46:29.780 --> 1:46:32.700]  Instead, China says, we own Joe Biden and they do.
[1:46:32.700 --> 1:46:35.300]  I mean, and they rub it in our face.
[1:46:35.300 --> 1:46:37.860]  I guess in China, that's a face thing for them
[1:46:37.860 --> 1:46:41.340]  just to like put us down and piss on our face like that.
[1:46:41.340 --> 1:46:42.740]  Oh yeah, I mean, China's still bitter
[1:46:42.740 --> 1:46:45.220]  about a whole bunch of things from the early 1900s
[1:46:45.220 --> 1:46:47.460]  where they blame America and the West in different respects
[1:46:47.460 --> 1:46:49.700]  and they've just been biting their time.
[1:46:49.700 --> 1:46:51.700]  The Chinese are very good at being patient.
[1:46:51.700 --> 1:46:54.260]  That's why like people think that the Chinese model
[1:46:54.260 --> 1:46:56.180]  is no longer a communist model
[1:46:56.180 --> 1:46:58.500]  because they embrace certain capitalistic forms
[1:46:58.500 --> 1:47:00.380]  of economic activity.
[1:47:00.380 --> 1:47:04.660]  They've always said that was an intermediary step
[1:47:04.660 --> 1:47:08.660]  to achieve true communism, to a true state control.
[1:47:08.660 --> 1:47:10.900]  And you look at the kind of Chinese methods
[1:47:10.900 --> 1:47:13.020]  and modes of operation that YouTube
[1:47:13.020 --> 1:47:15.460]  is gladly announcing to the world today
[1:47:15.460 --> 1:47:17.900]  and you get a sense of what the future looks like
[1:47:17.900 --> 1:47:21.260]  unless we build a populist movement to fight against it.
[1:47:21.260 --> 1:47:22.100]  It would be great to have Trump.
[1:47:22.100 --> 1:47:23.900]  Those who don't know, you're a constitutional lawyer.
[1:47:23.900 --> 1:47:28.140]  It's a big deal for YouTube to say last week, the CEO,
[1:47:28.140 --> 1:47:30.700]  we're gonna suppress white male speech because they're bad.
[1:47:30.700 --> 1:47:33.860]  I mean, that's total discrimination, textbook insane.
[1:47:33.860 --> 1:47:35.180]  And then now they're like, yeah,
[1:47:35.180 --> 1:47:36.980]  you criticize the election, you're banned.
[1:47:36.980 --> 1:47:39.060]  I mean, this is Soviet level.
[1:47:39.060 --> 1:47:41.220]  This is what Venezuela wishes they could do.
[1:47:41.220 --> 1:47:43.020]  I mean, there's not much more you can do
[1:47:43.020 --> 1:47:44.660]  other than arrests or kill us after this.
[1:47:44.660 --> 1:47:46.660]  I mean, this is maximum censorship.
[1:47:47.700 --> 1:47:50.940]  No doubt, and it comes on top of algorithmic manipulation
[1:47:50.940 --> 1:47:52.020]  throughout the election.
[1:47:52.020 --> 1:47:54.540]  And not only that, we're now discovering
[1:47:54.540 --> 1:47:57.020]  that Facebook and Zuckerberg were neck deep
[1:47:57.020 --> 1:48:00.380]  in all of these illicit plans to circumvent state rules
[1:48:00.380 --> 1:48:01.860]  and state laws about how election-
[1:48:01.860 --> 1:48:03.020]  Sure, they were helping strip out the names,
[1:48:03.020 --> 1:48:04.300]  mail them to everybody.
[1:48:04.300 --> 1:48:07.020]  They were creating the list of where to send the ballots.
[1:48:07.020 --> 1:48:09.100]  And knowing that, they're creating all these drop boxes.
[1:48:09.100 --> 1:48:12.140]  And they were basically replacing the salaries
[1:48:12.140 --> 1:48:13.820]  for various election officials
[1:48:13.820 --> 1:48:15.500]  to make sure they did their bidding
[1:48:15.500 --> 1:48:17.700]  rather than do the abide by the law,
[1:48:17.700 --> 1:48:18.540]  whether it came to signature-
[1:48:18.540 --> 1:48:22.140]  As a lot of state reps said in Arizona, this is racketeering.
[1:48:22.140 --> 1:48:23.340]  Oh, that's absolutely what it is.
[1:48:23.340 --> 1:48:25.260]  I mean, they weren't satisfied
[1:48:25.260 --> 1:48:26.860]  with all their algorithmic manipulation
[1:48:26.860 --> 1:48:28.660]  that Professor Epstein documented
[1:48:28.660 --> 1:48:30.860]  that could explain some of these anomalies.
[1:48:30.860 --> 1:48:32.420]  We're seeing counties that look the same,
[1:48:32.420 --> 1:48:34.540]  vote in opposite directions within the same state.
[1:48:34.540 --> 1:48:36.100]  Yeah, the landslide was so big
[1:48:36.100 --> 1:48:37.940]  that even their algorithmic couldn't do it,
[1:48:37.940 --> 1:48:40.900]  they had to get right down like LBJ to the drop boxes,
[1:48:40.900 --> 1:48:44.020]  to the ballot boxes, and actually physically stuff.
[1:48:44.020 --> 1:48:46.820]  I mean, except ballots are the currency of politics.
[1:48:46.820 --> 1:48:48.860]  So, I mean, what would happen if you just let it rain
[1:48:48.860 --> 1:48:51.180]  and let cash just flow everywhere out?
[1:48:51.180 --> 1:48:52.380]  That's what they did with the ballots.
[1:48:52.380 --> 1:48:53.620]  They just let them go out everywhere.
[1:48:53.620 --> 1:48:55.780]  And then all the chain of custody was lost.
[1:48:55.780 --> 1:48:57.580]  Chain of custody from when it was sent.
[1:48:57.580 --> 1:48:59.420]  And then those statistically conservatives
[1:48:59.420 --> 1:49:01.220]  and nationalists just don't cheat.
[1:49:01.220 --> 1:49:02.820]  I mean, it's like they could,
[1:49:02.820 --> 1:49:04.860]  the FBI interviewed over 10,000 people
[1:49:04.860 --> 1:49:06.580]  trying to set them up to take Russian money.
[1:49:06.580 --> 1:49:07.580]  No one did it.
[1:49:07.580 --> 1:49:10.380]  But Democrats, they would have all taken it.
[1:49:10.380 --> 1:49:11.220]  Oh, no doubt.
[1:49:11.220 --> 1:49:13.660]  Go back to 2012 when the New York Times said
[1:49:13.660 --> 1:49:15.340]  all the election experts agreed
[1:49:15.340 --> 1:49:17.180]  that absentee balloting and mail-in balloting
[1:49:17.180 --> 1:49:20.300]  was a huge area of fraud and was right for fraud.
[1:49:20.300 --> 1:49:21.900]  The reason why they said it is they thought
[1:49:21.900 --> 1:49:23.300]  Romney was gonna try to steal it
[1:49:23.300 --> 1:49:25.220]  from Obama using mail-in balloting.
[1:49:25.220 --> 1:49:27.140]  They just turned around and used those same tactics
[1:49:27.140 --> 1:49:30.460]  against Trump because they're more willing to do
[1:49:30.460 --> 1:49:32.380]  whatever they need to achieve the power
[1:49:32.380 --> 1:49:33.220]  that they want to achieve.
[1:49:33.220 --> 1:49:35.020]  And what do you call this in law and history?
[1:49:35.020 --> 1:49:37.300]  When you get enough people to commit a crime,
[1:49:37.300 --> 1:49:39.500]  everybody basically has immunity.
[1:49:39.500 --> 1:49:40.900]  They've just gotten the grassroots
[1:49:40.900 --> 1:49:43.580]  to join in election fraud, not voter fraud,
[1:49:43.580 --> 1:49:46.100]  but election fraud directed from all high,
[1:49:46.100 --> 1:49:49.420]  having a giant base that engages in it with you.
[1:49:49.420 --> 1:49:50.260]  I mean, no doubt.
[1:49:50.260 --> 1:49:51.500]  I mean, they gave them the motive.
[1:49:51.500 --> 1:49:53.140]  They said, you know, Donald Trump is a Hitler
[1:49:53.140 --> 1:49:54.980]  and don't you have a moral obligation
[1:49:54.980 --> 1:49:57.340]  to do anything to remove Hitler from power?
[1:49:57.340 --> 1:49:59.540]  And then they gave him the greatest means
[1:49:59.540 --> 1:50:00.940]  of theft in history.
[1:50:00.940 --> 1:50:02.820]  It would be like leaving the safe open,
[1:50:02.820 --> 1:50:04.980]  leaving the door open and putting a sign on the door
[1:50:04.980 --> 1:50:06.420]  saying, I'm gonna be gone for a month
[1:50:06.420 --> 1:50:08.620]  and by the way, the safe is loaded with cash
[1:50:08.620 --> 1:50:10.700]  and is open and unlocked.
[1:50:10.700 --> 1:50:12.020]  I mean, we knew what was gonna happen.
[1:50:12.020 --> 1:50:12.860]  Because he said it balanced the money.
[1:50:12.860 --> 1:50:13.980]  They're political power.
[1:50:13.980 --> 1:50:15.860]  They're a ticket to the treasury.
[1:50:15.860 --> 1:50:18.140]  They literally just counterfeited ballots
[1:50:18.140 --> 1:50:19.740]  and just sent 80 million of them out
[1:50:19.740 --> 1:50:21.780]  and then knew this would happen.
[1:50:21.780 --> 1:50:22.620]  No doubt.
[1:50:22.620 --> 1:50:23.460]  I mean, here in Las Vegas,
[1:50:23.460 --> 1:50:25.420]  I got multiple ballots for multiple people,
[1:50:25.420 --> 1:50:28.420]  including people that hadn't lived here in 10 years.
[1:50:28.420 --> 1:50:29.260]  So, I mean, it was clear
[1:50:29.260 --> 1:50:31.580]  they were just sending them out everywhere, every place,
[1:50:31.580 --> 1:50:33.020]  knowing it was the currency of the election.
[1:50:33.020 --> 1:50:34.540]  And the names on it, the addresses on it,
[1:50:34.540 --> 1:50:36.700]  the average Democrat just puts a fake,
[1:50:36.700 --> 1:50:37.740]  a lot of them even sign it.
[1:50:37.740 --> 1:50:40.100]  They just mail it back and it's counted.
[1:50:40.100 --> 1:50:40.940]  Oh, exactly.
[1:50:40.940 --> 1:50:42.340]  And that's why Trump didn't need to focus
[1:50:42.340 --> 1:50:44.860]  on all of the more extreme allegations
[1:50:44.860 --> 1:50:46.820]  because they stole it the old fashioned way.
[1:50:46.820 --> 1:50:48.700]  I mean, they stole it right in the open.
[1:50:48.700 --> 1:50:50.300]  They stole it by just making sure
[1:50:50.300 --> 1:50:51.980]  there was a flood of ballots that were out there
[1:50:51.980 --> 1:50:53.500]  and then a bunch of them would come back.
[1:50:53.500 --> 1:50:56.220]  And they used mainly liberal USPS workers
[1:50:56.220 --> 1:51:00.660]  who wouldn't even put it in the person's mailbox.
[1:51:00.660 --> 1:51:02.500]  They would just keep that thing,
[1:51:02.500 --> 1:51:04.980]  fill it out and put it back in the mail.
[1:51:04.980 --> 1:51:05.820]  Only then.
[1:51:05.820 --> 1:51:07.460]  The whole reason we've never liked mail-in ballots
[1:51:07.460 --> 1:51:09.500]  is because they removed the secret ballot.
[1:51:09.500 --> 1:51:11.020]  Because now your ballot can be bought,
[1:51:11.020 --> 1:51:12.300]  your ballot can be blackmailed,
[1:51:12.300 --> 1:51:14.980]  your ballot can be coerced, your ballot can be stolen.
[1:51:14.980 --> 1:51:15.820]  It can be torn up.
[1:51:15.820 --> 1:51:17.740]  None of those things can happen with a secret ballot.
[1:51:17.740 --> 1:51:18.580]  And that's the problem with mail-in ballots.
[1:51:18.580 --> 1:51:19.420]  Well, you notice all the country,
[1:51:19.420 --> 1:51:21.540]  they found Trump ballots torn up.
[1:51:21.540 --> 1:51:22.380]  Oh, exactly.
[1:51:22.380 --> 1:51:24.620]  And only that, if you wanna steal a ballot,
[1:51:24.620 --> 1:51:26.300]  all you gotta do, or if you wanna buy a ballot,
[1:51:26.300 --> 1:51:28.540]  you just go and now you no longer have to hope
[1:51:28.540 --> 1:51:31.540]  they do the right thing when they go into the polling place.
[1:51:31.540 --> 1:51:32.660]  You just take the ballot.
[1:51:32.660 --> 1:51:34.180]  You say, hey, sign on the outside.
[1:51:34.180 --> 1:51:35.220]  I'll fill it out for you.
[1:51:35.220 --> 1:51:37.220]  Here's 20 bucks, send it in.
[1:51:37.220 --> 1:51:39.020]  And that's the kind of fraud you can't even detect
[1:51:39.020 --> 1:51:40.460]  through things like signature matches.
[1:51:40.460 --> 1:51:43.340]  So there's no, they invited massive fraud.
[1:51:43.340 --> 1:51:46.620]  The New York Times own 2012 article said this would happen.
[1:51:46.620 --> 1:51:49.660]  We're seeing nursing homes with 95% turnout
[1:51:49.660 --> 1:51:51.940]  and another nursing home with 20% turnout.
[1:51:51.940 --> 1:51:53.580]  That's because somebody filled out those ballots
[1:51:53.580 --> 1:51:54.420]  for those.
[1:51:54.420 --> 1:51:56.220]  Well, listen, we gotta get into the vaccine
[1:51:56.220 --> 1:51:57.820]  and the tyranny and the roll-out.
[1:51:57.820 --> 1:51:59.660]  Cause it's all like a horse and carriage.
[1:51:59.660 --> 1:52:01.100]  And how we counter that,
[1:52:01.100 --> 1:52:04.340]  because the damage of the vaccines out of the gates
[1:52:04.340 --> 1:52:06.700]  with Robert Barnes, a little bit more time with him.
[1:52:06.700 --> 1:52:08.620]  And then I'm gonna get those callers back on
[1:52:08.620 --> 1:52:09.540]  when we into the show yesterday.
[1:52:09.540 --> 1:52:11.340]  We're gonna try to call them back and get them back home.
[1:52:11.340 --> 1:52:12.740]  We can open the phones up, get new callers.
[1:52:12.740 --> 1:52:15.100]  We love new callers, but I'm gonna call those callers back
[1:52:15.100 --> 1:52:17.980]  cause I promise we would get to them.
[1:52:17.980 --> 1:52:19.660]  That my God, this is so Twilight Zone.
[1:52:19.660 --> 1:52:22.660]  I'm having trouble even navigating this myself mentally.
[1:52:22.660 --> 1:52:24.380]  Shino, it must be getting all of you out there too
[1:52:24.380 --> 1:52:26.100]  because this is crazy.
[1:52:26.100 --> 1:52:28.700]  But this is because we've not punished criminals
[1:52:28.700 --> 1:52:30.260]  and punished executive criminals
[1:52:30.260 --> 1:52:31.540]  in government corporations.
[1:52:31.540 --> 1:52:34.380]  And so they're making a real run in America, folks.
[1:52:34.380 --> 1:52:35.420]  We'll be right back in two minutes.
[1:52:35.420 --> 1:52:36.260]  Stay with us.
[1:52:36.260 --> 1:52:41.260]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like
[1:52:42.900 --> 1:52:46.620]  with one of our most powerful products ever made, alpha power.
[1:52:46.620 --> 1:52:50.140]  As you age, your body can lose testosterone over time.
[1:52:50.140 --> 1:52:52.460]  With the incredible ingredients in this formula,
[1:52:52.460 --> 1:52:54.420]  we can help you beat the test of time
[1:52:54.420 --> 1:52:56.620]  and assist in restoring that lost energy
[1:52:56.620 --> 1:52:58.980]  and mood that comes with time and age.
[1:52:58.980 --> 1:53:00.860]  Alpha power's incredible ingredients
[1:53:00.860 --> 1:53:02.980]  can help you boost your sports performance
[1:53:02.980 --> 1:53:05.460]  or enhance your day-to-day life with ease

[1:53:09.060 --> 1:53:13.220]  or with super male vitality in the true alpha male path.
[1:53:13.220 --> 1:53:15.340]  Alpha power can help lose performance,
[1:53:15.340 --> 1:53:17.900]  help maintain normal testosterone levels,
[1:53:17.900 --> 1:53:20.420]  support healthy cholesterol, and more.
[1:53:20.420 --> 1:53:22.660]  Let alpha power help bring you to the peak
[1:53:22.660 --> 1:53:24.140]  of your optimal health.
[1:53:24.140 --> 1:53:27.180]  Don't fall short on energy in the fight against tyranny.
[1:53:27.180 --> 1:53:30.180]  Show the world what a true alpha male looks like today
[1:53:30.180 --> 1:53:31.220]  with alpha power.
[1:53:31.220 --> 1:53:36.220]  Head to infowarstore.com today.
[1:54:02.220 --> 1:54:04.740]  Do you see the headlines from CNN, ABC News?
[1:54:04.740 --> 1:54:07.140]  Doctors say it's worse than they ever thought.
[1:54:07.140 --> 1:54:09.740]  COVID, more dumbest things they could ever imagine.
[1:54:09.740 --> 1:54:12.420]  They told us that two and a half million people
[1:54:12.420 --> 1:54:15.940]  would be dead just eight months ago, within three months.
[1:54:15.940 --> 1:54:18.900]  Okay, it's a quarter million if you count
[1:54:18.900 --> 1:54:21.500]  all of the people that died of other things.
[1:54:21.500 --> 1:54:23.740]  We're talking 96% had comorbidity.
[1:54:23.740 --> 1:54:25.820]  These are real numbers, these are real facts.
[1:54:25.820 --> 1:54:27.420]  This is the chicken little event
[1:54:27.420 --> 1:54:29.780]  where we all run our houses, never come out,
[1:54:29.780 --> 1:54:31.180]  and are taught we're not essential.
[1:54:31.180 --> 1:54:33.740]  All the big box stores in Amazon take over the planet.
[1:54:33.740 --> 1:54:35.740]  You could stand up against it.
[1:54:35.740 --> 1:54:37.460]  This is slavery.
[1:54:37.460 --> 1:54:40.060]  It is not something you can put up with and survive.
[1:54:43.980 --> 1:54:47.060]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:54:50.620 --> 1:54:55.620]  I've got a tiger-fied tail to sway the sea.
[1:54:55.620 --> 1:55:00.620]  I won't be much when you get through with me.
[1:55:01.660 --> 1:55:03.940]  He never gives up.
[1:55:03.940 --> 1:55:07.300]  He's Alex Jones, broadcasting from deep
[1:55:07.300 --> 1:55:10.220]  in the heart of Texas, worldwide.
[1:55:10.220 --> 1:55:12.180]  All right, Robert Barnes with us, two more segments.
[1:55:12.180 --> 1:55:14.100]  I'm gonna open the phones up and also take the callers
[1:55:14.100 --> 1:55:14.980]  that were still on hold yesterday.
[1:55:14.980 --> 1:55:16.780]  We're calling them back right now.
[1:55:16.780 --> 1:55:18.940]  But back to the election.
[1:55:18.940 --> 1:55:21.500]  What would you call this historic period?
[1:55:21.500 --> 1:55:23.140]  And again, you talk about what the court should do,
[1:55:23.140 --> 1:55:25.100]  what Trump should do, but what can we do?
[1:55:25.100 --> 1:55:27.700]  I'm gonna be in DC this weekend, another big march.
[1:55:27.700 --> 1:55:30.260]  We're really making ourself seem
[1:55:30.260 --> 1:55:32.220]  because Big Tech's trying to suppress us.
[1:55:33.340 --> 1:55:35.580]  If they really had this in the bag,
[1:55:35.580 --> 1:55:38.220]  they wouldn't be saying nobody can question the election
[1:55:38.220 --> 1:55:40.460]  and nobody can say there's been any fraud,
[1:55:40.460 --> 1:55:43.420]  which is just Venezuela level, again, censorship.
[1:55:43.420 --> 1:55:44.700]  That to me is a sign of weakness.
[1:55:44.700 --> 1:55:45.740]  Am I wrong, Barnes?
[1:55:46.860 --> 1:55:48.020]  No, yeah, I agree with that.
[1:55:48.020 --> 1:55:49.620]  And I think two components with that.
[1:55:49.620 --> 1:55:51.620]  One is people continue to put pressure
[1:55:51.620 --> 1:55:54.500]  on all the elected officials that still have a role to play,
[1:55:54.500 --> 1:55:57.300]  particularly attorney generals who can be joining this suit.
[1:55:57.300 --> 1:56:00.180]  And then after that, they're house members and senators
[1:56:00.180 --> 1:56:04.020]  to join in objecting to the electoral college certification.
[1:56:04.020 --> 1:56:06.020]  If nothing happens at the Supreme Court level,
[1:56:06.020 --> 1:56:07.220]  that's productive ultimately.
[1:56:07.220 --> 1:56:08.940]  By the way, just to interrupt you,
[1:56:08.940 --> 1:56:10.660]  an hour ago when you first came on,
[1:56:10.660 --> 1:56:13.620]  you said Missouri should join the suit particularly
[1:56:13.620 --> 1:56:14.900]  because of the senator from that state,
[1:56:14.900 --> 1:56:15.740]  the former attorney general.
[1:56:15.740 --> 1:56:17.180]  They just joined it minutes ago.
[1:56:17.180 --> 1:56:18.260]  Go ahead.
[1:56:18.260 --> 1:56:19.220]  Yeah, which is fantastic.
[1:56:19.220 --> 1:56:21.460]  And that's where people can continue to put pressure on them,
[1:56:21.460 --> 1:56:23.060]  continue to put pressure on Congress,
[1:56:23.060 --> 1:56:26.020]  continue to put pressure on state attorney generals
[1:56:26.020 --> 1:56:28.860]  because every state should join that case
[1:56:28.860 --> 1:56:30.500]  that is in a democratic state.
[1:56:30.500 --> 1:56:32.580]  And the, I mean, the democratic state should too,
[1:56:32.580 --> 1:56:34.540]  if they actually cared about the constitution
[1:56:34.540 --> 1:56:36.140]  or cared about the consequences
[1:56:36.140 --> 1:56:38.300]  of constitutional violation that occurred here.
[1:56:38.300 --> 1:56:40.300]  The second aspect is continue to do,
[1:56:40.300 --> 1:56:43.140]  the reason why YouTube needs to engage in the censorship
[1:56:43.140 --> 1:56:45.220]  is because their continued suppression techniques
[1:56:45.220 --> 1:56:48.780]  have not fully been able to close the schools of learning,
[1:56:48.780 --> 1:56:50.940]  the archives of, either the archives of nature
[1:56:50.940 --> 1:56:52.060]  or the rights of man,
[1:56:52.060 --> 1:56:53.780]  but the sharing sites like this,
[1:56:53.780 --> 1:56:55.620]  there's a reason why they went after info wars
[1:56:55.620 --> 1:56:57.100]  before they went after anyone else.
[1:56:57.100 --> 1:56:59.380]  So by sharing sites, supporting info wars,
[1:56:59.380 --> 1:57:00.940]  keeping it alive, keeping it afloat,
[1:57:00.940 --> 1:57:02.580]  you were supposed to be dead by now.
[1:57:02.580 --> 1:57:04.460]  Info wars was supposed to be dead by now.
[1:57:04.460 --> 1:57:06.460]  Trump was supposed to have been crushed by now.
[1:57:06.460 --> 1:57:08.980]  None of those things happened because of the audience,
[1:57:08.980 --> 1:57:10.300]  because of the community, because of the people.
[1:57:10.300 --> 1:57:11.140]  And let's be clear,
[1:57:11.140 --> 1:57:13.620]  George Washington lost in the six year war,
[1:57:13.620 --> 1:57:16.220]  the first five, but he persevered,
[1:57:16.220 --> 1:57:17.060]  which was the victory.
[1:57:17.060 --> 1:57:18.660]  People need to understand that in war.
[1:57:18.660 --> 1:57:21.060]  You can be losing 90% of the time
[1:57:21.060 --> 1:57:23.820]  until right when you have the victory.
[1:57:23.820 --> 1:57:24.780]  Absolutely.
[1:57:24.780 --> 1:57:27.820]  And the power is always still with the people.
[1:57:27.820 --> 1:57:29.860]  Years ago, there was something called the Einstein Institute
[1:57:29.860 --> 1:57:32.300]  that was trying to undermine governments around the world.
[1:57:32.300 --> 1:57:33.540]  And they used to teach people
[1:57:33.540 --> 1:57:34.980]  that there's a fifth pillar of power
[1:57:34.980 --> 1:57:36.660]  under all other four pillars of power.
[1:57:36.660 --> 1:57:38.180]  And that's the perception of power,
[1:57:38.180 --> 1:57:40.300]  that the reality is as long as the people
[1:57:40.300 --> 1:57:42.500]  regain and take their own power
[1:57:42.500 --> 1:57:45.180]  by educating themselves and forming themselves,
[1:57:45.180 --> 1:57:47.580]  supporting places like info wars.
[1:57:47.580 --> 1:57:50.020]  That's why I have the coffee behind me right there.
[1:57:50.020 --> 1:57:55.020]  The is because it helps keep these independent ideas afloat.
[1:57:55.580 --> 1:57:59.380]  It keeps these independent chains of communication alive.
[1:57:59.380 --> 1:58:01.620]  It's what any successful revolution needs.
[1:58:01.620 --> 1:58:05.420]  It's what any successful true little D democracy needs.
[1:58:05.420 --> 1:58:07.500]  It needs the people to be proactive
[1:58:07.500 --> 1:58:10.300]  in supporting the institutions that keep their dreams,
[1:58:10.300 --> 1:58:12.700]  their ideas and their goals alive.
[1:58:12.700 --> 1:58:14.700]  And that has only happened because of the audience,
[1:58:14.700 --> 1:58:16.700]  because of the people, because of the supporters.
[1:58:16.700 --> 1:58:19.700]  That's the one thing YouTube can't shut up in silence.
[1:58:19.700 --> 1:58:21.500]  Is those people, and as long as they
[1:58:21.500 --> 1:58:23.420]  do not silence themselves
[1:58:23.420 --> 1:58:25.940]  and continue to support places like info wars,
[1:58:25.940 --> 1:58:28.060]  then the revolution will continue to have a voice.
[1:58:28.060 --> 1:58:29.580]  Exactly, as long as they don't get gaslighted
[1:58:29.580 --> 1:58:31.060]  to being convinced the war is over.
[1:58:31.060 --> 1:58:33.060]  As you said, if we don't give up,
[1:58:33.060 --> 1:58:35.940]  I'm not a Machiavelli, but I can certainly think like that.
[1:58:35.940 --> 1:58:37.540]  I don't follow Machiavellian tendencies,
[1:58:37.540 --> 1:58:39.420]  but I can just like you can understand them.
[1:58:39.420 --> 1:58:41.300]  You can understand, you're a great Machiavellian thinker
[1:58:41.300 --> 1:58:43.420]  as well, you have to think like the enemy.
[1:58:43.420 --> 1:58:45.660]  Is they actually still this successfully?
[1:58:45.660 --> 1:58:47.900]  My God, they have summoned their destruction.
[1:58:47.900 --> 1:58:51.020]  I mean, if people thought we saw grassroots uprising,
[1:58:51.020 --> 1:58:53.820]  this thing has just gone vertical.
[1:58:55.140 --> 1:58:55.980]  Oh, absolutely.
[1:58:55.980 --> 1:58:57.980]  So what I told people at the beginning of this process,
[1:58:57.980 --> 1:59:02.180]  I said worst case scenario is that the country learns
[1:59:02.180 --> 1:59:03.940]  how corrupt our judicial system is,
[1:59:03.940 --> 1:59:06.020]  how corrupt our elections can be,
[1:59:06.020 --> 1:59:08.180]  so that they are better informed and better armed
[1:59:08.180 --> 1:59:10.620]  to build a real political army
[1:59:10.620 --> 1:59:14.380]  to help take back the country by every mechanism,
[1:59:14.380 --> 1:59:17.700]  by every means legally and lawfully and democratically
[1:59:17.700 --> 1:59:21.460]  in the same way Andrew Jackson used his failure in 1824,
[1:59:21.460 --> 1:59:24.540]  his loss in 1824, the theft of 1824
[1:59:24.540 --> 1:59:27.060]  to build Jacksonian Revolution of 1828.
[1:59:28.300 --> 1:59:30.860]  We are in the middle of Act II, Act III is coming,
[1:59:30.860 --> 1:59:33.260]  and when it comes, it's gonna be the return of the Jedi,
[1:59:33.260 --> 1:59:34.700]  it's gonna be the return of Trump,
[1:59:34.700 --> 1:59:36.700]  and the only question is whether it's gonna be one month
[1:59:36.700 --> 1:59:38.700]  or four years from now, but either way,
[1:59:38.700 --> 1:59:40.780]  that's the inevitable outcome of this election.
[1:59:40.780 --> 1:59:42.980]  I agree, from a sick Machiavellian perspective,
[1:59:42.980 --> 1:59:44.500]  Trump getting in for four more years
[1:59:44.500 --> 1:59:46.900]  would mean they kind of corrupted, it would fall apart.
[1:59:46.900 --> 1:59:49.580]  What they're doing now is to destroy them.
[1:59:49.580 --> 1:59:53.940]  The trick that social engineers use is very, very simple.
[1:59:53.940 --> 1:59:57.860]  They just teach us that the architecture of civilization,
[1:59:57.860 --> 2:00:01.700]  that the trajectory of a species is designed
[2:00:01.700 --> 2:00:05.820]  by these ever-knowing, loving, liberal technocrats,
[2:00:05.820 --> 2:00:07.860]  and that if we just sit back and enjoy the ride,
[2:00:07.860 --> 2:00:10.140]  everything will be great, but then they tell us
[2:00:10.140 --> 2:00:12.580]  that humans are obsolete, not essential,
[2:00:12.580 --> 2:00:14.500]  and we're bad for the earth and we need to be phased out,
[2:00:14.500 --> 2:00:17.940]  so they're very open about what they're doing,
[2:00:17.940 --> 2:00:21.820]  and they count on us just being very passive living
[2:00:21.820 --> 2:00:25.420]  in the matrix-like system that they're building.
[2:00:25.420 --> 2:00:28.260]  But what defines humans more than anything
[2:00:28.260 --> 2:00:30.660]  from the rest of the, quote, animal kingdom
[2:00:30.660 --> 2:00:32.620]  is that we control our environment,
[2:00:32.620 --> 2:00:36.060]  we build our own environments, we create our own systems,
[2:00:36.060 --> 2:00:39.620]  we really geo-engineer and terraform the planet,
[2:00:39.620 --> 2:00:42.580]  and it systems towards our aims.
[2:00:42.580 --> 2:00:44.220]  But instead, we're acting like animals
[2:00:44.220 --> 2:00:46.300]  and the globalists play the part of humans
[2:00:46.300 --> 2:00:48.380]  and us as cattle, and that's the trick.
[2:00:50.820 --> 2:01:01.780]  All right, folks, Alex Shields here back live.
[2:01:01.780 --> 2:01:03.900]  Final segment is to start hour number three
[2:01:03.900 --> 2:01:06.020]  with Robert Barnes, and I'll continue after with calls
[2:01:06.020 --> 2:01:08.140]  and a lot of breaking news.
[2:01:08.140 --> 2:01:10.020]  Barnes, of course, did a great job,
[2:01:10.020 --> 2:01:12.940]  just as a visiting host for several months,
[2:01:12.940 --> 2:01:14.820]  hosting election countdown.
[2:01:15.700 --> 2:01:17.380]  We're calling it American Countdown,
[2:01:17.380 --> 2:01:18.660]  then it becomes election countdown,
[2:01:18.660 --> 2:01:21.140]  and I said, watch, election countdown will continue through,
[2:01:21.140 --> 2:01:22.620]  the Democrats are gonna contest it
[2:01:22.620 --> 2:01:23.780]  if they can't outright steal it,
[2:01:23.780 --> 2:01:26.340]  so we're in the middle of that revolution
[2:01:26.340 --> 2:01:28.540]  between the globalists and the Americans right now,
[2:01:28.540 --> 2:01:31.180]  but Barnes is gonna be co-hosting with her,
[2:01:31.180 --> 2:01:33.620]  most week nights, he's got a lot going on,
[2:01:33.620 --> 2:01:35.340]  they'll be co-hosting with her starting next week,
[2:01:35.340 --> 2:01:40.020]  7 a.m., 7 p.m., to 9 p.m., central on the M4s,
[2:01:40.020 --> 2:01:41.980]  radio and TV satellite network,
[2:01:41.980 --> 2:01:43.620]  so a lot of stations are already picking it up
[2:01:43.620 --> 2:01:46.460]  when in current other stations to pick it up as well now.
[2:01:46.460 --> 2:01:48.820]  Okay, Barnes, in the 10 minutes we got left,
[2:01:48.820 --> 2:01:52.060]  get into the mRNA vaccine, the lockdowns,
[2:01:52.060 --> 2:01:54.820]  the world government, the tyranny, CNN saying,
[2:01:54.820 --> 2:01:56.260]  it's worse than we thought it would be.
[2:01:56.260 --> 2:01:57.980]  Really, they said 2.5 million dead
[2:01:57.980 --> 2:01:59.940]  in the first six months, didn't happen.
[2:01:59.940 --> 2:02:02.980]  I mean, there's courts ruling, Florida saying,
[2:02:02.980 --> 2:02:06.420]  hey, you're turning the PCR test up way high
[2:02:06.420 --> 2:02:08.980]  to have false positives, where is this going?
[2:02:08.980 --> 2:02:10.100]  What do we do?
[2:02:10.100 --> 2:02:12.100]  Why are they pushing an mRNA vaccine
[2:02:12.100 --> 2:02:15.340]  that reprograms the cells and is causing massive illnesses?
[2:02:15.340 --> 2:02:16.380]  What are they doing?
[2:02:16.380 --> 2:02:17.900]  What is this an exercise in?
[2:02:17.900 --> 2:02:21.980]  Insanity, liability protection, a medical takeover,
[2:02:21.980 --> 2:02:23.260]  what the hell's going on?
[2:02:24.180 --> 2:02:27.060]  Well, it does feel like a real live Milgram experiment
[2:02:27.060 --> 2:02:28.340]  in terms of what's taking place,
[2:02:28.340 --> 2:02:29.660]  and they keep sort of testing.
[2:02:29.660 --> 2:02:31.620]  I mean, I'm just waiting for a governor or mayor
[2:02:31.620 --> 2:02:34.300]  or some politician somewhere to say that
[2:02:34.300 --> 2:02:36.700]  as a part of avoiding the virus tomorrow,
[2:02:36.700 --> 2:02:41.420]  you need to go out and only pop on one leg, wherever you go,
[2:02:41.420 --> 2:02:43.660]  just to see how many people will go along with it,
[2:02:43.660 --> 2:02:45.180]  because so far they have achieved
[2:02:45.180 --> 2:02:47.940]  an extraordinary levels of social control.
[2:02:47.940 --> 2:02:50.540]  Using this as a pretext to rig an election,
[2:02:50.540 --> 2:02:52.620]  using it as a pretext to deprive people
[2:02:52.620 --> 2:02:53.980]  of their right to have a job,
[2:02:53.980 --> 2:02:56.820]  even arguing in court in Pennsylvania
[2:02:56.820 --> 2:02:59.140]  that you have no right to a job,
[2:02:59.140 --> 2:03:00.860]  you have no right to earn money,
[2:03:00.860 --> 2:03:02.420]  you have no right to an occupation,
[2:03:02.420 --> 2:03:03.940]  you have no right to a business.
[2:03:03.940 --> 2:03:06.020]  The vaccine, that's what the Pennsylvania governor
[2:03:06.020 --> 2:03:07.020]  argued in court.
[2:03:07.020 --> 2:03:10.140]  You are obsolete, but the big corporations,
[2:03:10.140 --> 2:03:11.100]  they are essential.
[2:03:11.100 --> 2:03:12.580]  This is a true revolution.
[2:03:13.580 --> 2:03:14.780]  Oh, no doubt, exactly.
[2:03:14.780 --> 2:03:17.420]  I mean, this is, well, it's a corporate woke virus, right?
[2:03:17.420 --> 2:03:18.500]  It knows the difference.
[2:03:18.500 --> 2:03:20.140]  It knows not to go into Walmart,
[2:03:20.140 --> 2:03:23.540]  not to go into Costco, not to raid Wall Street,
[2:03:23.540 --> 2:03:25.700]  but not to go into a casino,
[2:03:25.700 --> 2:03:27.420]  not to go into a strip club,
[2:03:27.420 --> 2:03:29.100]  but if you have a small business,
[2:03:29.100 --> 2:03:31.620]  a mom and pop shop, or if you're a local church,
[2:03:31.620 --> 2:03:34.300]  or if you're a school, or particularly a religious school,
[2:03:34.300 --> 2:03:36.740]  it knows to invade and infect everybody.
[2:03:36.740 --> 2:03:39.380]  So it's preposterous policy
[2:03:39.380 --> 2:03:42.140]  in the name of a scary, scary virus.
[2:03:42.140 --> 2:03:43.460]  And the next step of it,
[2:03:43.460 --> 2:03:45.900]  I mean, it's the great reset being put in action,
[2:03:45.900 --> 2:03:47.180]  and they're not exactly hiding it.
[2:03:47.180 --> 2:03:50.340]  They've been blatantly calling for this now for years,
[2:03:50.340 --> 2:03:52.780]  and they're just connecting it overtly to the pandemic,
[2:03:52.780 --> 2:03:53.620]  and we're seeing the evidence of it.
[2:03:53.620 --> 2:03:55.940]  But you said it, it's a Milgram experiment.
[2:03:55.940 --> 2:03:56.820]  For those that don't know,
[2:03:56.820 --> 2:03:59.540]  Milgram or the Stanford research was a similar.
[2:03:59.540 --> 2:04:00.980]  They could get the majority of people
[2:04:00.980 --> 2:04:02.700]  to kill people they believed,
[2:04:02.700 --> 2:04:05.940]  if ordered by an authority figure in a white lab code.
[2:04:05.940 --> 2:04:07.700]  And so this is all just an example
[2:04:07.700 --> 2:04:09.740]  to see what followers will do.
[2:04:09.740 --> 2:04:12.620]  And even Klaus Schwab admits this is a drill
[2:04:12.620 --> 2:04:13.500]  for world government.
[2:04:13.500 --> 2:04:15.420]  They don't even deny it.
[2:04:15.420 --> 2:04:16.340]  No doubt about it.
[2:04:16.340 --> 2:04:18.620]  And it's worked at an extraordinary level.
[2:04:18.620 --> 2:04:20.660]  I mean, they've got people to be scared of their family,
[2:04:20.660 --> 2:04:21.900]  be scared of their loved ones,
[2:04:21.900 --> 2:04:23.340]  be scared of their friends,
[2:04:23.340 --> 2:04:25.300]  be scared to go do a Thanksgiving,
[2:04:25.300 --> 2:04:27.180]  be scared to go have a Christmas,
[2:04:27.180 --> 2:04:28.740]  be scared to go to the park,
[2:04:28.740 --> 2:04:31.060]  be scared to send their kids to the school,
[2:04:31.060 --> 2:04:33.700]  be scared to own or operate their own business,
[2:04:33.700 --> 2:04:35.380]  be afraid to go to church.
[2:04:35.380 --> 2:04:38.260]  These are things to be afraid to go to a political rally.
[2:04:38.260 --> 2:04:40.260]  I mean, these are things no one thought possible
[2:04:40.260 --> 2:04:41.180]  or conceivable.
[2:04:41.180 --> 2:04:42.020]  And then of course,
[2:04:42.020 --> 2:04:43.580]  we've had the obvious effects of the lockdown
[2:04:43.580 --> 2:04:45.580]  and the skyrocketing suicides,
[2:04:45.580 --> 2:04:48.180]  the skyrocketing rates of drug and alcohol abuse
[2:04:48.180 --> 2:04:49.580]  and deaths and violence.
[2:04:49.580 --> 2:04:52.140]  The large number of people who didn't get necessary
[2:04:52.140 --> 2:04:54.460]  cancer, prescreening and other medical treatment,
[2:04:54.460 --> 2:04:56.580]  heart disease, liver, the record low,
[2:04:56.580 --> 2:04:58.980]  the people who are dying are dying because of the lockdowns.
[2:04:58.980 --> 2:05:00.980]  They're not dying because of COVID.
[2:05:00.980 --> 2:05:02.300]  In terms of the excess deaths
[2:05:02.300 --> 2:05:04.460]  that have taken place for the most part.
[2:05:04.460 --> 2:05:06.660]  And so I think we have to fight back.
[2:05:06.660 --> 2:05:09.180]  I'm gonna be working with Robert Kennedy Jr.
[2:05:09.180 --> 2:05:11.620]  to fight back in lawsuits everywhere across the country,
[2:05:11.620 --> 2:05:14.460]  wherever we can, whenever we can, however we can,
[2:05:14.460 --> 2:05:16.860]  because he recognizes the exact same threat
[2:05:16.860 --> 2:05:19.660]  that I recognize and that we need to build a cross party,
[2:05:19.660 --> 2:05:23.460]  cross ideology, cross political movement,
[2:05:23.460 --> 2:05:25.420]  because we need to be attacking this from the left,
[2:05:25.420 --> 2:05:27.180]  the right, the center and every other place
[2:05:27.180 --> 2:05:30.220]  because this is freedom itself that is at risk,
[2:05:30.220 --> 2:05:32.340]  freedom itself that is at stake.
[2:05:32.340 --> 2:05:34.700]  Just as the presidential election is about the future
[2:05:34.700 --> 2:05:36.460]  integrity of all of our elections
[2:05:36.460 --> 2:05:39.620]  and the core constitutional accord itself at stake.
[2:05:39.620 --> 2:05:41.340]  And it was COVID that was used to put out
[2:05:41.340 --> 2:05:43.700]  the 80 million ballots and COVID for the force
[2:05:43.700 --> 2:05:46.060]  inoculations, I mean, they actuaried it,
[2:05:46.060 --> 2:05:48.420]  they pre-programmed it, they prepared it.
[2:05:48.420 --> 2:05:51.860]  It's so diabolical, people must reject the whole thing.
[2:05:51.860 --> 2:05:54.580]  Why do you think Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates
[2:05:54.580 --> 2:05:56.820]  are so honest about, this is really a drill,
[2:05:56.820 --> 2:05:59.500]  it's for your own good, this will reduce population,
[2:05:59.500 --> 2:06:00.780]  take my shot.
[2:06:00.780 --> 2:06:02.340]  I mean, I guess legally, lawfully,
[2:06:02.340 --> 2:06:04.060]  they've gotta go ahead and tell you
[2:06:04.060 --> 2:06:06.460]  and then say we want liability protection.
[2:06:06.460 --> 2:06:08.620]  And by the way, a lot of you are gonna get hurt,
[2:06:08.620 --> 2:06:10.060]  but don't listen to conspiracy theorists
[2:06:10.060 --> 2:06:11.100]  that tell you you're gonna get hurt.
[2:06:11.100 --> 2:06:12.900]  They let go, we're gonna hurt you,
[2:06:12.900 --> 2:06:14.700]  but don't listen to those that say we're gonna hurt you.
[2:06:14.700 --> 2:06:17.620]  It's like a weird, but it's a thing they follow.
[2:06:17.620 --> 2:06:18.580]  They all do the same thing.
[2:06:18.580 --> 2:06:19.420]  What is it?
[2:06:20.420 --> 2:06:22.580]  Well, it's like the other Stanford experiment
[2:06:22.580 --> 2:06:24.700]  where once they put one group of students
[2:06:24.700 --> 2:06:26.220]  in charge of another group of students
[2:06:26.220 --> 2:06:27.460]  and one were called wardens
[2:06:27.460 --> 2:06:29.140]  and the other ones called prisoners,
[2:06:29.140 --> 2:06:32.380]  they enjoyed their abuse and were more open and overt
[2:06:32.380 --> 2:06:34.580]  that they were abusing and would abuse
[2:06:34.580 --> 2:06:37.220]  as that power rushed in.
[2:06:37.220 --> 2:06:40.020]  So you're seeing Gates getting to see his life dream
[2:06:40.020 --> 2:06:41.540]  finally come to fruition,
[2:06:41.540 --> 2:06:44.500]  terrify and terrorize the world into submission
[2:06:44.500 --> 2:06:47.540]  to whatever gender and objectives that he sees fit.
[2:06:47.540 --> 2:06:49.780]  And in fact, I mean, it was what you were talking about,
[2:06:49.780 --> 2:06:52.100]  what we were talking about nine, 10 months ago
[2:06:52.100 --> 2:06:53.420]  at the very beginning of this,
[2:06:53.420 --> 2:06:56.060]  said the whole goal is gonna be to terrify everybody
[2:06:56.060 --> 2:06:58.100]  to be so scared that they're on their knees
[2:06:58.100 --> 2:06:59.980]  begging for a Bill Gates vaccine.
[2:06:59.980 --> 2:07:01.700]  And now that's exactly what's happened.
[2:07:01.700 --> 2:07:03.340]  And if you look at it, he's suddenly
[2:07:03.340 --> 2:07:04.980]  the chief medical officer of the world
[2:07:04.980 --> 2:07:06.180]  is all the robberman money
[2:07:06.180 --> 2:07:08.220]  went and bought off all the medical systems.
[2:07:08.220 --> 2:07:12.140]  And now he wants to put, you and her law are right,
[2:07:12.140 --> 2:07:14.340]  explain this, this is not a classic vaccine.
[2:07:14.340 --> 2:07:19.340]  This mRNA is literally the genome reprogramming ourselves.
[2:07:19.780 --> 2:07:22.380]  That's only supposed to happen between the sperm
[2:07:22.380 --> 2:07:25.460]  and the egg that begins an entire life cycle.
[2:07:25.460 --> 2:07:27.700]  Anything else is a mutation or cancer.
[2:07:27.700 --> 2:07:29.740]  So this is a form of cancer they're giving you.
[2:07:29.740 --> 2:07:32.460]  They admit, and now all these medical scientists admit it.
[2:07:32.460 --> 2:07:34.260]  How does he think you'll get away
[2:07:34.260 --> 2:07:36.100]  with this mass crime against humanity?
[2:07:37.140 --> 2:07:38.460]  Well, he completely co-opted
[2:07:38.460 --> 2:07:40.340]  the entire public health establishment.
[2:07:40.340 --> 2:07:43.260]  He has the press entirely on his side.
[2:07:43.260 --> 2:07:46.020]  And he has most politicians cowering before him
[2:07:46.020 --> 2:07:47.180]  and bowing to him.
[2:07:47.180 --> 2:07:49.660]  And too many of the, too few of the public
[2:07:49.660 --> 2:07:51.500]  willing to contest it and challenge it.
[2:07:51.500 --> 2:07:52.820]  And outside of info wars,
[2:07:52.820 --> 2:07:54.180]  you're not allowed to talk about this
[2:07:54.180 --> 2:07:56.900]  in most places in social media or the regular media.
[2:07:56.900 --> 2:07:58.100]  Oh yeah, Google says another thing.
[2:07:58.100 --> 2:08:02.340]  No criticism of Bill Gates or Soros.
[2:08:02.340 --> 2:08:05.340]  What's insane is, if you show him on 60 Minutes saying,
[2:08:05.340 --> 2:08:08.180]  I work for the Nazis, best title of my life, your ban.
[2:08:08.180 --> 2:08:09.580]  He said that on 60 Minutes.
[2:08:09.580 --> 2:08:11.140]  I mean, this is real tyrannic.
[2:08:12.060 --> 2:08:12.900]  No doubt about it.
[2:08:12.900 --> 2:08:14.340]  And you know that they're gonna be banning
[2:08:14.340 --> 2:08:16.140]  any criticism of the vaccines.
[2:08:16.140 --> 2:08:17.460]  That's coming.
[2:08:17.460 --> 2:08:18.300]  And I mean, especially-
[2:08:18.300 --> 2:08:19.140]  Oh no, it's already here.
[2:08:19.140 --> 2:08:22.100]  They've already announced no criticism of it.
[2:08:22.100 --> 2:08:22.940]  Oh, exactly.
[2:08:22.940 --> 2:08:23.860]  When I was talking to Bobby Kennedy,
[2:08:23.860 --> 2:08:27.100]  like the extraordinary is like somehow we take a drug,
[2:08:27.100 --> 2:08:29.860]  an experimental drug, a drug that has no history
[2:08:29.860 --> 2:08:33.140]  of successfully treating this particular medical condition.
[2:08:33.140 --> 2:08:35.860]  There's never been a successful coronavirus vaccine ever.
[2:08:35.860 --> 2:08:38.940]  Frankly, there hasn't really been successful flu vaccines
[2:08:38.940 --> 2:08:40.100]  by most measurements.
[2:08:40.100 --> 2:08:42.940]  I mean, in any given year, they fail half the time.
[2:08:42.940 --> 2:08:46.420]  So the idea that any of, we call a drug a vaccine
[2:08:46.420 --> 2:08:48.540]  and magically it's been blessed by God
[2:08:48.540 --> 2:08:49.860]  and somehow is miraculous.
[2:08:49.860 --> 2:08:50.700]  It must be clear.
[2:08:50.700 --> 2:08:53.940]  Somebody just added genes to a tomato, folks got mad.
[2:08:53.940 --> 2:08:58.420]  This is going in and randomly reprogramming yourselves?
[2:08:58.420 --> 2:09:00.340]  I mean, this is insane.
[2:09:00.340 --> 2:09:01.180]  It's gene editing.
[2:09:01.180 --> 2:09:02.940]  I mean, it's been the ultimate objective.
[2:09:02.940 --> 2:09:05.060]  I mean, basically, like we've been talking
[2:09:05.060 --> 2:09:06.740]  about the social credit model
[2:09:06.740 --> 2:09:09.700]  and predicting how China was gonna utilize that
[2:09:09.700 --> 2:09:12.420]  in terms of our own big tech censorship here.
[2:09:12.420 --> 2:09:14.260]  The same models of gene editing,
[2:09:14.260 --> 2:09:17.220]  the same models of experimentation on human beings
[2:09:17.220 --> 2:09:18.620]  has been going on in China.
[2:09:18.620 --> 2:09:21.700]  It has been the focal point of this for the last 10, 15 years.
[2:09:21.700 --> 2:09:24.220]  You've been way ahead of the curve talking about this.
[2:09:24.220 --> 2:09:26.900]  They're just using the vaccine as a guise to do so.
[2:09:26.900 --> 2:09:28.580]  And it's not news for Bill Gates.
[2:09:28.580 --> 2:09:29.900]  I mean, he was trying to,
[2:09:29.900 --> 2:09:33.180]  according to effective allegations in Africa,
[2:09:33.180 --> 2:09:34.820]  he was trying to use vaccines
[2:09:34.820 --> 2:09:37.300]  as a disguised sterilization mechanism before.
[2:09:37.300 --> 2:09:39.700]  So the idea that he would use vaccines as a guise
[2:09:39.700 --> 2:09:42.060]  for some other agenda is nothing new.
[2:09:42.060 --> 2:09:44.820]  When he himself says his vaccine agenda
[2:09:44.820 --> 2:09:46.620]  is not driven by really vaccines,
[2:09:46.620 --> 2:09:49.380]  it's driven by overpopulation that he wants to...
[2:09:49.380 --> 2:09:50.820]  Well, he's like, we went to us like,
[2:09:50.820 --> 2:09:51.860]  hey, go along with it,
[2:09:51.860 --> 2:09:54.020]  but they're targeting everybody, it's wrong.
[2:09:54.020 --> 2:09:56.260]  And now they're like, oh, Chinese super soldiers,
[2:09:56.260 --> 2:09:58.620]  they were given mRNA to make them super men.
[2:09:58.620 --> 2:10:00.540]  So when you medically experiment on your troops,
[2:10:00.540 --> 2:10:02.900]  you just spit it like, oh, we made them super soldiers.
[2:10:02.900 --> 2:10:06.220]  See how they hide crime like it's creating Captain America?
[2:10:07.460 --> 2:10:08.300]  Oh, completely.
[2:10:08.300 --> 2:10:10.900]  I mean, what China's been doing out in the open
[2:10:10.900 --> 2:10:12.100]  is just extraordinary.
[2:10:12.100 --> 2:10:15.300]  What is terrifying is the Chinese model for everything,
[2:10:15.300 --> 2:10:19.780]  economics, politics, power, science, human relations,
[2:10:19.780 --> 2:10:21.380]  human resources, medicine,
[2:10:21.380 --> 2:10:24.380]  that's what's coming to America and the whole world.
[2:10:24.380 --> 2:10:27.220]  And the only fight back to date has been Trump
[2:10:27.220 --> 2:10:28.940]  and the only fight back moving forward
[2:10:28.940 --> 2:10:32.100]  is gonna be all of us, the people in the citizenry,
[2:10:32.100 --> 2:10:33.260]  doing everything we can,
[2:10:33.260 --> 2:10:35.580]  including supporting places like Info Wars
[2:10:35.580 --> 2:10:38.780]  to make democracy stay alive against this extraordinary...
[2:10:38.780 --> 2:10:40.500]  A pro-human future, all right,
[2:10:40.500 --> 2:10:42.180]  you're gonna be hosting with the Arnold Reign
[2:10:42.180 --> 2:10:44.980]  this Monday, the election countdown,
[2:10:44.980 --> 2:10:46.020]  Robert Barnes on Twitter,
[2:10:46.020 --> 2:10:48.260]  finding Barnes Law, thank you so much.
[2:10:48.260 --> 2:10:50.540]  Hey, everybody, confused about staying healthy
[2:10:50.540 --> 2:10:52.260]  in a crazy COVID culture?
[2:10:52.260 --> 2:10:54.900]  Me too, but listen, after all the research,
[2:10:54.900 --> 2:10:56.340]  all the conflicting studies,
[2:10:56.340 --> 2:10:57.420]  after all the squabbling,
[2:10:57.420 --> 2:11:00.180]  there's one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[2:11:00.180 --> 2:11:01.740]  It's that immune system health
[2:11:01.740 --> 2:11:04.580]  can literally be the difference between life and death.
[2:11:04.580 --> 2:11:07.460]  You probably already believe that, I certainly do.
[2:11:07.460 --> 2:11:10.020]  So here's the thing, I wanted to get past the craziness
[2:11:10.020 --> 2:11:12.620]  and find out which plant-based substances
[2:11:12.620 --> 2:11:14.740]  actually have studies that demonstrate
[2:11:14.740 --> 2:11:17.260]  some efficacy in immune support.
[2:11:17.260 --> 2:11:18.860]  Now, you'll have to sign a waiver,

[2:13:56.740 --> 2:13:57.860]  I'm Alex Jones.
[2:13:57.860 --> 2:13:58.820]  I started in Full Wars,
[2:13:58.820 --> 2:14:01.300]  but I couldn't have done any of this without you.

[2:14:05.940 --> 2:14:08.100]  is weighing up the fact that we've done our research
[2:14:08.100 --> 2:14:09.380]  and we've been dead on.

[2:14:55.140 --> 2:15:01.180]  Well, this is great.
[2:15:01.180 --> 2:15:05.180]  Maybe I didn't reach you
[2:15:08.180 --> 2:15:11.180]  Quite as good as I should
[2:15:14.180 --> 2:15:18.180]  Maybe I didn't love you
[2:15:21.180 --> 2:15:25.180]  Quite as often as I could
[2:15:25.180 --> 2:15:33.180]  Little things, little things I should have said and done
[2:15:34.180 --> 2:15:37.180]  I'll just never take the time

[2:15:51.180 --> 2:15:53.180]  The Elvis clone bringing us out
[2:15:54.180 --> 2:15:57.180]  Maybe I didn't hold you
[2:15:58.180 --> 2:16:00.180]  I'll go to some of your phone calls
[2:16:00.180 --> 2:16:02.180]  Toll for you to join us
[2:16:02.180 --> 2:16:06.180]  877-789-2539, 877-789 Alex
[2:16:07.180 --> 2:16:10.180]  But look at this breaking news on Infowars.com
[2:16:10.180 --> 2:16:14.180]  Just in, Vatican enters into a global alliance
[2:16:14.180 --> 2:16:20.180]  With Rothschild, Rockefeller and Ford Foundation, Mastercard, Bank of America
[2:16:20.180 --> 2:16:27.180]  And others for the new council of inclusive capitalism
[2:16:27.180 --> 2:16:30.180]  To get your new Vatican indulgence there
[2:16:30.180 --> 2:16:35.180]  To create a more inclusive, sustainable and trusted economic system
[2:16:35.180 --> 2:16:37.180]  As they try to bankrupt the world system
[2:16:37.180 --> 2:16:39.180]  The UN asks for money to feed the starving
[2:16:39.180 --> 2:16:41.180]  And as they shut off everybody's bank accounts
[2:16:41.180 --> 2:16:46.180]  They go, oh, we're going to make it more inclusive for you while they don't
[2:16:46.180 --> 2:16:50.180]  It's like funding Black Lives Matter towards Soros
[2:16:50.180 --> 2:16:54.180]  While they cut off and block energy development in Africa
[2:16:54.180 --> 2:16:57.180]  It's beyond sick
[2:16:57.180 --> 2:17:00.180]  That's why when they announced the new head of the Soros Foundation
[2:17:00.180 --> 2:17:02.180]  The Smartmatic Voting Machine Company head
[2:17:02.180 --> 2:17:07.180]  He's like, our dream of helping black people will soon be there
[2:17:07.180 --> 2:17:10.180]  We love them, we pledge ourselves to black people
[2:17:10.180 --> 2:17:12.180]  What they're saying is we represent all black people
[2:17:12.180 --> 2:17:15.180]  We speak for you while we kill everybody
[2:17:15.180 --> 2:17:17.180]  And while we kill you especially
[2:17:17.180 --> 2:17:20.180]  I mean, it's sick, man
[2:17:20.180 --> 2:17:23.180]  Hitler instead of said, I support the Jews, I speak for Israel
[2:17:23.180 --> 2:17:25.180]  Everyone's just bowed down
[2:17:25.180 --> 2:17:27.180]  Or, you know, I speak for black people
[2:17:27.180 --> 2:17:30.180]  But he was honest about it, he did
[2:17:30.180 --> 2:17:32.180]  And then, of course, they financed the collapse of the third world
[2:17:32.180 --> 2:17:34.180]  Flies with third world populations
[2:17:34.180 --> 2:17:36.180]  Who they turn as racist against white people
[2:17:36.180 --> 2:17:40.180]  All the big mega-billionaire bankers like whites are inherently bad
[2:17:40.180 --> 2:17:44.180]  We're going to suppress white men on YouTube, they said this week
[2:17:44.180 --> 2:17:48.180]  The average white guy is going to go, man, screw these black people and brown people
[2:17:48.180 --> 2:17:50.180]  But it's all a globalist manipulation
[2:17:50.180 --> 2:17:54.180]  By ruthless dirtbag corporations that run slave camps in China
[2:17:54.180 --> 2:17:56.180]  It's sick manipulation
[2:17:56.180 --> 2:18:00.180]  It's dirty, it's nasty, it's low down, it's disgusting
[2:18:03.180 --> 2:18:06.180]  It's like the Star Trek episode where the alien's on board, you can't see it
[2:18:06.180 --> 2:18:09.180]  And it's playing everybody off against to kill each other
[2:18:09.180 --> 2:18:12.180]  And as soon as you figure out it's doing it, you just start laughing
[2:18:12.180 --> 2:18:16.180]  And the alien goes away because it lives off negative energy
[2:18:16.180 --> 2:18:19.180]  Well, that allegory is perfect for this
[2:18:21.180 --> 2:18:24.180]  That doesn't mean I hate myself because I'm white
[2:18:24.180 --> 2:18:27.180]  Or you hate yourself because you're black, you love yourself because you're human
[2:18:27.180 --> 2:18:29.180]  And you know we've got problems and there's issues
[2:18:29.180 --> 2:18:32.180]  And sometimes whites do mean things, blacks do mean things, it doesn't matter
[2:18:32.180 --> 2:18:36.180]  We understand there's a group manipulating it to get power and destroy us all
[2:18:36.180 --> 2:18:40.180]  And we transcend it and we get above it
[2:18:40.180 --> 2:18:44.180]  It's kind of like you lost your map, you can't find it
[2:18:44.180 --> 2:18:46.180]  You finally get to another gas station, you buy another map
[2:18:46.180 --> 2:18:48.180]  Back in the day you only had maps and now you know where you're going
[2:18:48.180 --> 2:18:51.180]  Or you're kind of, it's at night, you're in the mountains, you're driving
[2:18:51.180 --> 2:18:53.180]  Or you're on the right road, you don't know it's suddenly
[2:18:53.180 --> 2:18:56.180]  You go over a hill and there's a big city below you
[2:18:56.180 --> 2:18:57.180]  You know, it's Albuquerque
[2:18:57.180 --> 2:19:00.180]  And oh, it's Albuquerque, you kind of go down that dome
[2:19:00.180 --> 2:19:02.180]  It's like, behind the dark it says, oh, it's Albuquerque
[2:19:02.180 --> 2:19:04.180]  You see all the lights, you know you're there
[2:19:04.180 --> 2:19:09.180]  And so that's what this process is like
[2:19:09.180 --> 2:19:12.180]  And they want to keep us in the dark, folks
[2:19:12.180 --> 2:19:14.180]  And it needs to stop
[2:19:14.180 --> 2:19:16.180]  All right, we got a lot of callers here
[2:19:16.180 --> 2:19:20.180]  Scott and Scott and Chris and David and Isaac and Paul
[2:19:20.180 --> 2:19:23.180]  And Chris and Josh and Chris and all the Chris's
[2:19:23.180 --> 2:19:25.180]  Let's go to Scott and Vermont first
[2:19:25.180 --> 2:19:28.180]  On Marshall Law, Biden versus Trump, DOJ
[2:19:28.180 --> 2:19:30.180]  Thanks for calling, thanks for getting back with us, go ahead
[2:19:30.180 --> 2:19:32.180]  Hello Alex, thanks for taking my call
[2:19:32.180 --> 2:19:35.180]  Yeah, three quick things first
[2:19:35.180 --> 2:19:38.180]  The new website is okay, but it took out the cartoons
[2:19:38.180 --> 2:19:41.180]  Please put the cartoons back and the website in fours
[2:19:41.180 --> 2:19:42.180]  You know, that's a good point
[2:19:42.180 --> 2:19:44.180]  We should create a cartoon section
[2:19:44.180 --> 2:19:46.180]  And have cartoons front and center
[2:19:46.180 --> 2:19:47.180]  I was thinking that too
[2:19:47.180 --> 2:19:50.180]  Well, you had it near the bottom on the old website
[2:19:50.180 --> 2:19:51.180]  And that was fine
[2:19:51.180 --> 2:19:53.180]  And turmeric, there's two Rs in turmeric
[2:19:53.180 --> 2:19:55.180]  You keep announcing a turmeric
[2:19:55.180 --> 2:19:57.180]  Well, you know, I kind of do things my own way
[2:19:57.180 --> 2:20:00.180]  I emailed you that a year ago, but Adam maybe didn't get the
[2:20:00.180 --> 2:20:02.180]  Tomato tamada
[2:20:02.180 --> 2:20:05.180]  And it was a turmeric
[2:20:05.180 --> 2:20:07.180]  30 years ago, a turmeric, yeah
[2:20:07.180 --> 2:20:10.180]  30 years ago, I covered these Swiss made homeopathic pills
[2:20:10.180 --> 2:20:13.180]  I put one under my tongue and I think of the brand name
[2:20:13.180 --> 2:20:16.180]  But they have a little Swiss cross on the bottle
[2:20:16.180 --> 2:20:19.180]  I'd be able to get all the springtime pollen in my face
[2:20:19.180 --> 2:20:21.180]  And everything, it wouldn't bother me for the whole day
[2:20:21.180 --> 2:20:24.180]  You might want to try that for your allergies
[2:20:24.180 --> 2:20:28.180]  And as far as Mr. Barnes, your attorney
[2:20:28.180 --> 2:20:31.180]  A few weeks ago, I found out about the Jacobson ruling
[2:20:31.180 --> 2:20:33.180]  It's over 100 years old, as far as martial law
[2:20:33.180 --> 2:20:36.180]  I worry about that Jacobson ruling being still here
[2:20:36.180 --> 2:20:39.180]  Yeah, that was the one for forced inoculation and eugenics, yeah
[2:20:39.180 --> 2:20:42.180]  But it involves other things like your attorney pointed out
[2:20:42.180 --> 2:20:45.180]  Tied to like martial law
[2:20:45.180 --> 2:20:48.180]  Yeah, well, I wasn't pushing martial law when he was on
[2:20:48.180 --> 2:20:49.180]  I was getting his view on it
[2:20:49.180 --> 2:20:50.180]  Right, right
[2:20:50.180 --> 2:20:51.180]  But he brought up the Jacobson ruling
[2:20:51.180 --> 2:20:54.180]  How that could be used to justify some lockdown garbage
[2:20:54.180 --> 2:20:56.180]  But we do have the good thing with it
[2:20:56.180 --> 2:20:59.180]  Pennsylvania governor was overruled by a federal judge
[2:20:59.180 --> 2:21:01.180]  Saying it was unconstitutional
[2:21:01.180 --> 2:21:03.180]  What state was that? Was it Pennsylvania?
[2:21:03.180 --> 2:21:07.180]  Pennsylvania, Michigan, California
[2:21:07.180 --> 2:21:09.180]  They've all ruled that the lockdowns are unconstitutional
[2:21:09.180 --> 2:21:11.180]  But these dictators don't care
[2:21:11.180 --> 2:21:13.180]  They just go full steam ahead
[2:21:13.180 --> 2:21:14.180]  That's good
[2:21:14.180 --> 2:21:17.180]  Now, my theory, and I hope I'm wrong about this
[2:21:17.180 --> 2:21:20.180]  If we do have to put up with President Beijing, Biden
[2:21:20.180 --> 2:21:23.180]  And Kamila Harris
[2:21:23.180 --> 2:21:25.180]  I fear there might be a deal behind the scenes
[2:21:25.180 --> 2:21:27.180]  You know how the Democrats
[2:21:27.180 --> 2:21:30.180]  It's been saying that they can prosecute Trump
[2:21:30.180 --> 2:21:32.180]  For supposed crimes that he committed
[2:21:32.180 --> 2:21:34.180]  That they claim he committed
[2:21:34.180 --> 2:21:36.180]  Well, there might be a deal
[2:21:36.180 --> 2:21:37.180]  Where Beijing Biden says
[2:21:37.180 --> 2:21:40.180]  I'll have my justice department leave you alone
[2:21:40.180 --> 2:21:42.180]  As far as any of that stuff
[2:21:42.180 --> 2:21:45.180]  If you stop talking about me and my corruptions with
[2:21:45.180 --> 2:21:46.180]  Well, there's no doubt
[2:21:46.180 --> 2:21:47.180]  There's no question that Biden has said
[2:21:47.180 --> 2:21:49.180]  I will leave you alone, Trump, leave me alone
[2:21:49.180 --> 2:21:50.180]  Those are public statements
[2:21:50.180 --> 2:21:52.180]  So that's just how corrupt politics works
[2:21:52.180 --> 2:21:54.180]  Great point, I appreciate your call, Scott
[2:21:54.180 --> 2:21:58.180]  Another Scott in South Carolina, go ahead, sir
[2:21:58.180 --> 2:21:59.180]  Hello
[2:21:59.180 --> 2:22:00.180]  Yes, sir, go ahead
[2:22:00.180 --> 2:22:04.180]  Hey, Alex, thanks for calling me back
[2:22:04.180 --> 2:22:07.180]  I just wanted to make two points
[2:22:07.180 --> 2:22:10.180]  I had called back on Veterans Day
[2:22:10.180 --> 2:22:13.180]  And I was basically making the point that
[2:22:13.180 --> 2:22:15.180]  I think I felt as if Trump
[2:22:15.180 --> 2:22:17.180]  All he needed to see was the American people
[2:22:17.180 --> 2:22:19.180]  Stand up and come out there in numbers
[2:22:19.180 --> 2:22:22.180]  And drove for him to make the move
[2:22:22.180 --> 2:22:23.180]  That he needs to make
[2:22:23.180 --> 2:22:27.180]  And ever since then, I feel like so much has happened
[2:22:27.180 --> 2:22:31.180]  So I think this move here on the 12th
[2:22:31.180 --> 2:22:32.180]  To march on D.C.
[2:22:32.180 --> 2:22:35.180]  I think this is one of the most important times
[2:22:35.180 --> 2:22:37.180]  As we know the quickening is now
[2:22:37.180 --> 2:22:39.180]  I mean, and I just think that's going to be
[2:22:39.180 --> 2:22:41.180]  One of the most important things
[2:22:41.180 --> 2:22:45.180]  Second point
[2:22:45.180 --> 2:22:47.180]  You mentioned, we have like
[2:22:47.180 --> 2:22:51.180]  Quadruple quintuplets, the amount of
[2:22:51.180 --> 2:22:53.180]  People listening and tuning in
[2:22:53.180 --> 2:22:55.180]  How come people are buying the supplement?
[2:22:55.180 --> 2:22:56.180]  People need to get in there
[2:22:56.180 --> 2:22:58.180]  In infowars stores
[2:22:58.180 --> 2:22:59.180]  Look, look, look, look, look
[2:22:59.180 --> 2:23:01.180]  They've since everybody else
[2:23:01.180 --> 2:23:02.180]  The stuff's all mainstream now
[2:23:02.180 --> 2:23:03.180]  Everybody else is shut down
[2:23:03.180 --> 2:23:04.180]  So they're going to come here
[2:23:04.180 --> 2:23:06.180]  So that's a good thing
[2:23:06.180 --> 2:23:08.180]  I'm just pointing out that it's a lot of new listeners
[2:23:08.180 --> 2:23:10.180]  And I'm letting regular listeners know
[2:23:10.180 --> 2:23:11.180]  Thank you for the support
[2:23:11.180 --> 2:23:13.180]  Because your support isn't just getting great products
[2:23:13.180 --> 2:23:16.180]  It is really affecting change now
[2:23:16.180 --> 2:23:19.180]  And praise God, we are having a huge harvest
[2:23:19.180 --> 2:23:20.180]  Of awakening people
[2:23:20.180 --> 2:23:22.180]  And so I was telling new listeners
[2:23:22.180 --> 2:23:24.180]  Hey, you might want to kick into the kitty here
[2:23:24.180 --> 2:23:25.180]  Because we're having
[2:23:25.180 --> 2:23:26.180]  We had to build our own infrastructure
[2:23:26.180 --> 2:23:27.180]  People come here and they go
[2:23:27.180 --> 2:23:28.180]  Why do you have satellite uplinks
[2:23:28.180 --> 2:23:30.180]  And encoders and all this machine?
[2:23:30.180 --> 2:23:32.180]  Because most people have a phone
[2:23:32.180 --> 2:23:34.180]  Or a computer that dials into Google
[2:23:34.180 --> 2:23:35.180]  Or Twitter or Facebook
[2:23:35.180 --> 2:23:36.180]  And they have all the stuff
[2:23:36.180 --> 2:23:39.180]  We've got buildings of stuff
[2:23:39.180 --> 2:23:42.180]  So, you know, millions of dollars of equipment
[2:23:42.180 --> 2:23:44.180]  Because we had to do it all ourselves
[2:23:44.180 --> 2:23:45.180]  And I'm not bitching
[2:23:45.180 --> 2:23:47.180]  It's just that that's what I'm talking about
[2:23:47.180 --> 2:23:49.180]  The project for world government
[2:23:49.180 --> 2:23:50.180]  Built by the British Empire
[2:23:50.180 --> 2:23:51.180]  Via Cecil Rhodes
[2:23:51.180 --> 2:23:53.180]  Then picked up by the Rockefeller family
[2:23:53.180 --> 2:23:54.180]  And the major Robert Barons
[2:23:54.180 --> 2:23:56.180]  The planet by the 1920s
[2:23:56.180 --> 2:23:59.180]  Is all about corporate global governance
[2:23:59.180 --> 2:24:00.180]  And now you're seeing it
[2:24:00.180 --> 2:24:01.180]  It's not just the blue states
[2:24:01.180 --> 2:24:02.180]  The blue cities, the communists
[2:24:02.180 --> 2:24:03.180]  And socialist nations
[2:24:03.180 --> 2:24:04.180]  All working in unison
[2:24:04.180 --> 2:24:06.180]  Under UN control
[2:24:06.180 --> 2:24:08.180]  Establish a medical planetary dictatorship
[2:24:08.180 --> 2:24:10.180]  At the core of it is
[2:24:10.180 --> 2:24:12.180]  The Fortune 100 corporations
[2:24:12.180 --> 2:24:14.180]  Themselves funded by a handful
[2:24:14.180 --> 2:24:16.180]  Of private central banking families
[2:24:16.180 --> 2:24:18.180]  The Rothschilds, the Rockefellers
[2:24:18.180 --> 2:24:19.180]  The Dutch and British royalty
[2:24:19.180 --> 2:24:21.180]  Being at the very heart of that
[2:24:21.180 --> 2:24:23.180]  Then you learn the Dutch and British royalty
[2:24:23.180 --> 2:24:25.180]  Aren't even Dutch or British at the same time
[2:24:25.180 --> 2:24:28.180]  But they go back to the literal count Dracula
[2:24:28.180 --> 2:24:30.180]  And the wars in between
[2:24:30.180 --> 2:24:32.180]  Christendom and Islam
[2:24:32.180 --> 2:24:35.180]  Those that don't know history really are
[2:24:35.180 --> 2:24:36.180]  Doomed or repeated
[2:24:36.180 --> 2:24:38.180]  They're involved in poting the world economy
[2:24:38.180 --> 2:24:40.180]  That's what the social distancing
[2:24:40.180 --> 2:24:41.180]  The masks are all about
[2:24:41.180 --> 2:24:43.180]  It's about bankrupting local small businesses
[2:24:43.180 --> 2:24:44.180]  And those that comply
[2:24:44.180 --> 2:24:46.180]  Are compliant with your own destruction
[2:24:46.180 --> 2:24:47.180]  Wake up
[2:24:47.180 --> 2:24:49.180]  The globalists have always been at war
[2:24:49.180 --> 2:24:51.180]  With the family and small businesses
[2:24:51.180 --> 2:24:52.180]  They want control
[2:24:52.180 --> 2:24:53.180]  They want domesticated slaves
[2:24:53.180 --> 2:24:56.180]  That's the process that is taking place right now
[2:24:56.180 --> 2:24:58.180]  And when you shop at the big box stores
[2:24:58.180 --> 2:25:00.180]  And when you shop with Amazon
[2:25:00.180 --> 2:25:03.180]  Remember that they are creating monopolies
[2:25:03.180 --> 2:25:05.180]  And they are the globalists that are pushing
[2:25:05.180 --> 2:25:07.180]  The lockdowns, gun control, abortion
[2:25:07.180 --> 2:25:08.180]  World government, all of it
[2:25:08.180 --> 2:25:09.180]  If you want to do that
[2:25:09.180 --> 2:25:10.180]  Go ahead and shop there
[2:25:10.180 --> 2:25:12.180]  But if you'll shop at M4 Wars
[2:25:12.180 --> 2:25:14.180]  Where we have thousands of products
[2:25:14.180 --> 2:25:15.180]  Made right here in America
[2:25:15.180 --> 2:25:16.180]  With our warehouses
[2:25:16.180 --> 2:25:17.180]  That we do
[2:25:17.180 --> 2:25:18.180]  It's incredible
[2:25:18.180 --> 2:25:19.180]  And it changes the whole world
[2:25:19.180 --> 2:25:20.180]  So do your shopping
[2:25:20.180 --> 2:25:22.180]  If you want to fund the M4 War
[2:25:22.180 --> 2:25:23.180]  And if you want to stop the globalists

[2:25:30.180 --> 2:25:33.180]  By Christmas if you order by the 18th
[2:25:33.180 --> 2:25:34.180]  So again, I want to thank you all
[2:25:34.180 --> 2:25:35.180]  For your support
[2:25:35.180 --> 2:25:36.180]  I want to thank you for thinking through
[2:25:36.180 --> 2:25:37.180]  What you do
[2:25:37.180 --> 2:25:38.180]  And where you spend your money
[2:25:38.180 --> 2:25:39.180]  And do your shopping
[2:25:39.180 --> 2:25:40.180]  And get great products
[2:25:40.180 --> 2:25:47.180]  M4WarsStore.com
[2:26:10.180 --> 2:26:20.180]  M4WarsStore.com
[2:26:41.180 --> 2:26:43.180]  The globalists are acting like another species
[2:26:43.180 --> 2:26:44.180]  That's overtaking us and overriding us
[2:26:44.180 --> 2:27:10.180]  It's all the same in the end
[2:27:14.180 --> 2:27:20.180]  Have yourself a merry little Christmas
[2:27:20.180 --> 2:27:23.180]  Let yourself be lies
[2:27:23.180 --> 2:27:25.180]  Yeah, and expose the globalists while you're at it
[2:27:25.180 --> 2:27:34.180]  From now on, our troubles will be outside
[2:27:34.180 --> 2:27:37.180]  Bill Gates has got a little present
[2:27:37.180 --> 2:27:39.180]  Coming down your chimney
[2:27:39.180 --> 2:27:40.180]  Let's stick it in you
[2:27:40.180 --> 2:27:42.180]  Make the yuletide gay
[2:27:42.180 --> 2:27:44.180]  You need to submit to him
[2:27:44.180 --> 2:27:49.180]  From now on, our troubles will be miles away
[2:27:49.180 --> 2:27:54.180]  Because you'll be dead
[2:27:54.180 --> 2:27:58.180]  Here we are as in olden days
[2:27:58.180 --> 2:27:59.180]  Alright, let's go through the three headlines
[2:27:59.180 --> 2:28:00.180]  And go back to your calls
[2:28:00.180 --> 2:28:01.180]  Let's just look at a few of these headlines
[2:28:01.180 --> 2:28:03.180]  Oh, and this is every few minutes
[2:28:03.180 --> 2:28:04.180]  This is breaking
[2:28:04.180 --> 2:28:07.180]  Like, oh, 59 here died, 27 here died
[2:28:07.180 --> 2:28:10.180]  10,000 got paralyzed, you know
[2:28:10.180 --> 2:28:13.180]  Four volunteers who took Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine
[2:28:13.180 --> 2:28:15.180]  Developed Bell's Palsy
[2:28:15.180 --> 2:28:19.180]  Six died, they say it's no problem
[2:28:19.180 --> 2:28:25.180]  Five names for 100 million vaccination in first 100 days
[2:28:25.180 --> 2:28:27.180]  UK warns people with severe allergies
[2:28:27.180 --> 2:28:29.180]  Should not take the COVID vaccine
[2:28:29.180 --> 2:28:31.180]  Also, that it causes miscarriages
[2:28:31.180 --> 2:28:33.180]  Well, that's no big deal
[2:28:33.180 --> 2:28:37.180]  Haha, merry little Christmas from Bill Gates
[2:28:37.180 --> 2:28:40.180]  A journalist, he's checking it twice
[2:28:40.180 --> 2:28:42.180]  He'll decide who's killed and who's not
[2:28:42.180 --> 2:28:46.180]  Here comes Bill Gates and the eugenics train
[2:28:46.180 --> 2:28:49.180]  His mommy worked for the head of IBM
[2:28:49.180 --> 2:28:51.180]  Who was Hitler's top advisor
[2:28:51.180 --> 2:28:54.180]  His dad ran Planned Parenthood
[2:28:54.180 --> 2:28:56.180]  And he's gonna kill you, oh
[2:28:56.180 --> 2:28:58.180]  Welcome, Bill Gates
[2:28:58.180 --> 2:29:00.180]  You are so great
[2:29:00.180 --> 2:29:03.180]  We love you, Bill Gates
[2:29:03.180 --> 2:29:08.180]  Oh, my God, excuse me
[2:29:08.180 --> 2:29:10.180]  We've got a lot more here to cover
[2:29:10.180 --> 2:29:13.180]  But, oh yeah, FDA, six people died during Pfizer
[2:29:13.180 --> 2:29:16.180]  COVID vaccine trial
[2:29:16.180 --> 2:29:19.180]  At Cornell, a flu shot is mandatory
[2:29:19.180 --> 2:29:21.180]  But only if you're white
[2:29:21.180 --> 2:29:23.180]  It turns out the black students know the history
[2:29:23.180 --> 2:29:25.180]  Of secret experimentation
[2:29:25.180 --> 2:29:27.180]  So they're refusing, so Cornell said
[2:29:27.180 --> 2:29:29.180]  If you're black, you don't have to take it
[2:29:29.180 --> 2:29:32.180]  Well, that's a start
[2:29:32.180 --> 2:29:34.180]  I heard in PR two weeks ago
[2:29:34.180 --> 2:29:36.180]  A lot of black people are paranoid
[2:29:36.180 --> 2:29:38.180]  Because of secret testing in Africa
[2:29:38.180 --> 2:29:40.180]  And here with syphilis
[2:29:40.180 --> 2:29:42.180]  We promised, that was in the past, not now
[2:29:42.180 --> 2:29:44.180]  It's like, do you think anyone trusts you?
[2:29:44.180 --> 2:29:47.180]  Haha
[2:29:47.180 --> 2:29:50.180]  Hey, white people, only you gotta take it
[2:29:50.180 --> 2:29:52.180]  I'm sorry, I shouldn't laugh, it's not funny
[2:29:52.180 --> 2:29:54.180]  This is just getting sick
[2:29:54.180 --> 2:29:56.180]  Oh, my gosh, I have trouble breathing, sorry
[2:29:56.180 --> 2:30:00.180]  Haha
[2:30:00.180 --> 2:30:02.180]  The poll majority want travel ban
[2:30:02.180 --> 2:30:04.180]  For the unvaccinated
[2:30:04.180 --> 2:30:06.180]  But other polls show, over two thirds
[2:30:06.180 --> 2:30:08.180]  Don't want vaccines, they use fake polls, folks
[2:30:08.180 --> 2:30:12.180]  Continuing
[2:30:12.180 --> 2:30:14.180]  Canada Health Ministry
[2:30:14.180 --> 2:30:16.180]  Exploring immunity passports
[2:30:16.180 --> 2:30:18.180]  Vaccine tracking surveillance, we told you
[2:30:18.180 --> 2:30:20.180]  That was all coming
[2:30:20.180 --> 2:30:22.180]  More travel companies said they want you to take it
[2:30:22.180 --> 2:30:24.180]  And they admit the Pfizer
[2:30:24.180 --> 2:30:26.180]  mRNA vaccine could kill you
[2:30:26.180 --> 2:30:28.180]  If you have any type of allergy
[2:30:28.180 --> 2:30:30.180]  Ben Shapiro, get vaccinated dopes
[2:30:30.180 --> 2:30:32.180]  Oh, that's so intellectual
[2:30:32.180 --> 2:30:34.180]  Get vaccinated dopes
[2:30:34.180 --> 2:30:36.180]  And he's never censored
[2:30:36.180 --> 2:30:38.180]  He's forced pushed by Google and Twitter
[2:30:38.180 --> 2:30:40.180]  And Facebook, because we know why
[2:30:40.180 --> 2:30:42.180]  But look at him
[2:30:42.180 --> 2:30:44.180]  The man child, he just
[2:30:44.180 --> 2:30:46.180]  He's just so intelligent
[2:30:46.180 --> 2:30:48.180]  He can debate like 70 IQ leftists
[2:30:48.180 --> 2:30:50.180]  He's like, I make a million dollars
[2:30:50.180 --> 2:30:52.180]  Every day from Big Tech
[2:30:52.180 --> 2:30:54.180]  Who sponsors me, oh hi
[2:30:54.180 --> 2:30:56.180]  Oh hi, get the vaccine dopes
[2:30:56.180 --> 2:30:58.180]  Get the vaccine dopes
[2:30:58.180 --> 2:31:00.180]  Dopes, oh you're dopey
[2:31:00.180 --> 2:31:02.180]  You'll be real dopey once you take the shots
[2:31:02.180 --> 2:31:04.180]  Because then Ben can actually be superior to you
[2:31:04.180 --> 2:31:06.180]  I bet ol' Benny Boy ain't taking the shots
[2:31:10.180 --> 2:31:12.180]  Get the vaccines dopes
[2:31:12.180 --> 2:31:14.180]  Look at it, the man child
[2:31:16.180 --> 2:31:18.180]  It just has liability protection
[2:31:18.180 --> 2:31:20.180]  It's super dangerous, they're getting all these reasons
[2:31:20.180 --> 2:31:22.180]  You shouldn't take it
[2:31:22.180 --> 2:31:24.180]  But oh, he said
[2:31:24.180 --> 2:31:26.180]  So just look at him, he's just
[2:31:26.180 --> 2:31:28.180]  He's just a genius folks
[2:31:30.180 --> 2:31:32.180]  He gets up to give speeches
[2:31:32.180 --> 2:31:34.180]  Where he's been paid to be a speaker
[2:31:34.180 --> 2:31:36.180]  And he'll go, and now, this minute
[2:31:36.180 --> 2:31:38.180]  Brought to you by, they'll say an insurance company
[2:31:38.180 --> 2:31:40.180]  Dearing the speech he's giving
[2:31:40.180 --> 2:31:42.180]  Nothing against money to fund yourself
[2:31:42.180 --> 2:31:44.180]  But he has almost no employees, no one
[2:31:44.180 --> 2:31:46.180]  He's just a little greedy
[2:31:46.180 --> 2:31:48.180]  Anti-American dirtbag
[2:31:48.180 --> 2:31:50.180]  Who says, oh, I'm Ben Shapiro
[2:31:50.180 --> 2:31:52.180]  Get your shots dopes
[2:31:52.180 --> 2:31:54.180]  How intellectual
[2:31:54.180 --> 2:31:56.180]  Oh, I don't want to argue with being called a dope
[2:31:56.180 --> 2:31:58.180]  Oh my gosh
[2:31:58.180 --> 2:32:00.180]  I'm going to take all the vaccines
[2:32:00.180 --> 2:32:02.180]  Because I don't want Ben Shapiro who intimidates me
[2:32:02.180 --> 2:32:04.180]  Because he's so smart, is that him?
[2:32:04.180 --> 2:32:06.180]  Oh my god
[2:32:06.180 --> 2:32:08.180]  There's no end
[2:32:08.180 --> 2:32:10.180]  He's been told he was born and he is our messiah
[2:32:10.180 --> 2:32:12.180]  And so we have to all bow to him
[2:32:12.180 --> 2:32:14.180]  FDA
[2:32:14.180 --> 2:32:16.180]  Six people died during the Pfizer COVID test
[2:32:16.180 --> 2:32:18.180]  How about you take a few of those
[2:32:18.180 --> 2:32:20.180]  Mr. Dopey Dope
[2:32:20.180 --> 2:32:22.180]  I'm sure you're not taking it
[2:32:22.180 --> 2:32:24.180]  NGO smuggling large numbers
[2:32:24.180 --> 2:32:26.180]  Of Somalis on the Greek island
[2:32:26.180 --> 2:32:28.180]  By the way
[2:32:28.180 --> 2:32:30.180]  National security disaster
[2:32:30.180 --> 2:32:32.180]  House unanimously passes TPS
[2:32:32.180 --> 2:32:34.180]  Amnesty for
[2:32:34.180 --> 2:32:36.180]  Hong Kong residents expands definition
[2:32:36.180 --> 2:32:38.180]  Of refugees
[2:32:38.180 --> 2:32:40.180]  And it goes on and on
[2:32:40.180 --> 2:32:42.180]  That was only a small part
[2:32:42.180 --> 2:32:44.180]  Of my
[2:32:44.180 --> 2:32:46.180]  Vaccine news, let's go back
[2:32:46.180 --> 2:32:48.180]  Let's go back to your calls
[2:32:48.180 --> 2:32:50.180]  Chris in North
[2:32:50.180 --> 2:32:52.180]  No, no, South Carolina
[2:32:52.180 --> 2:32:54.180]  Hey Alex, thanks to you
[2:32:54.180 --> 2:32:56.180]  And your crew for calling me back
[2:32:56.180 --> 2:32:58.180]  I'm a long time listener
[2:32:58.180 --> 2:33:00.180]  Waging the info war here in the upstate
[2:33:00.180 --> 2:33:02.180]  Of South Carolina
[2:33:02.180 --> 2:33:04.180]  Quickly, I wanted to let everyone know
[2:33:04.180 --> 2:33:06.180]  That the US postal system has been slow
[2:33:06.180 --> 2:33:08.180]  For instance, I had ordered
[2:33:08.180 --> 2:33:10.180]  My mega hat on October 22nd
[2:33:10.180 --> 2:33:12.180]  And I didn't get it until election day
[2:33:12.180 --> 2:33:14.180]  But I'm taking that as a good sign
[2:33:14.180 --> 2:33:16.180]  That since it came in on election day
[2:33:16.180 --> 2:33:18.180]  That our president's going to be re-elected
[2:33:18.180 --> 2:33:20.180]  I've recently ordered from info wars
[2:33:20.180 --> 2:33:22.180]  And I'm still waiting on it
[2:33:22.180 --> 2:33:24.180]  Your warehouse got it out fast
[2:33:24.180 --> 2:33:26.180]  But the postal system is slow
[2:33:26.180 --> 2:33:28.180]  Well that's right, everybody should get their orders
[2:33:28.180 --> 2:33:30.180]  In now for Christmas
[2:33:30.180 --> 2:33:32.180]  The postal service tells us the 18th
[2:33:32.180 --> 2:33:34.180]  But there is this major breakdown
[2:33:34.180 --> 2:33:36.180]  Because of the COVID hysteria
[2:33:36.180 --> 2:33:38.180]  People can also order UPS
[2:33:38.180 --> 2:33:40.180]  But regardless, it's usually Christmas
[2:33:40.180 --> 2:33:42.180]  Helps fund us in the next year
[2:33:42.180 --> 2:33:44.180]  To let us know what we can do
[2:33:44.180 --> 2:33:46.180]  Yeah, absolutely
[2:33:46.180 --> 2:33:48.180]  So the reason I called yesterday
[2:33:48.180 --> 2:33:50.180]  You were talking about martial law
[2:33:50.180 --> 2:33:52.180]  And how you were kind of
[2:33:52.180 --> 2:33:54.180]  Viewing it as
[2:33:54.180 --> 2:33:56.180]  You're not saying that martial law is good
[2:33:56.180 --> 2:33:58.180]  But it's pretty much necessary
[2:33:58.180 --> 2:34:00.180]  Because we've been usurped by the hostile
[2:34:00.180 --> 2:34:02.180]  Globalist takeover
[2:34:02.180 --> 2:34:04.180]  Under the definition, it's when you're
[2:34:04.180 --> 2:34:06.180]  Occupied and your civilian
[2:34:06.180 --> 2:34:08.180]  System's broken down
[2:34:08.180 --> 2:34:10.180]  And not doing its job
[2:34:10.180 --> 2:34:12.180]  Then you have to have it
[2:34:12.180 --> 2:34:14.180]  Right, I think at a certain point
[2:34:14.180 --> 2:34:16.180]  If you had people under him to arrest the globalist
[2:34:16.180 --> 2:34:18.180]  Right? Well they're going to call that
[2:34:18.180 --> 2:34:20.180]  Martial law if he does that
[2:34:20.180 --> 2:34:22.180]  And so no one ever gets to that point
[2:34:22.180 --> 2:34:24.180]  Where they set up their own martial law
[2:34:24.180 --> 2:34:26.180]  Their own fiat system and we just sit there and take it
[2:34:26.180 --> 2:34:28.180]  Because we're following the quote rules
[2:34:28.180 --> 2:34:30.180]  Well the rules were already thrown out the window
[2:34:30.180 --> 2:34:32.180]  Right
[2:34:32.180 --> 2:34:34.180]  And I'm just trying to
[2:34:34.180 --> 2:34:36.180]  Make sure that we're not saying that
[2:34:36.180 --> 2:34:38.180]  Like martial law is, you know
[2:34:38.180 --> 2:34:40.180]  Hey, don't worry, the military is controlled
[2:34:40.180 --> 2:34:42.180]  By the globalist countries done
[2:34:42.180 --> 2:34:44.180]  We're going to be under Chinese martial law, bro
[2:34:44.180 --> 2:34:46.180]  They're never going to let you out of your house
[2:34:46.180 --> 2:34:48.180]  It's over, probably, I mean, you don't worry
[2:34:48.180 --> 2:34:50.180]  We're under Chinese martial law
[2:34:50.180 --> 2:34:52.180]  We're under big tech martial law
[2:34:52.180 --> 2:34:54.180]  We're under blue state, blue city martial law
[2:34:54.180 --> 2:34:56.180]  You don't have to worry about Trump
[2:34:56.180 --> 2:34:58.180]  He's probably done, the country's probably done
[2:34:58.180 --> 2:35:00.180]  Well, is Trump going to do better?
[2:35:00.180 --> 2:35:02.180]  No, no, but listen, you and David Knight and others
[2:35:02.180 --> 2:35:04.180]  Don't have to worry
[2:35:04.180 --> 2:35:06.180]  You know, I'm not declaring martial law
[2:35:06.180 --> 2:35:08.180]  You're not declaring it, Trump isn't
[2:35:08.180 --> 2:35:10.180]  No one's going to oppose that because that's kind of fashionable
[2:35:10.180 --> 2:35:12.180]  I'm just saying
[2:35:12.180 --> 2:35:14.180]  That, you know, George Washington
[2:35:14.180 --> 2:35:16.180]  Would rise up and arrest these people
[2:35:16.180 --> 2:35:18.180]  But he'd be called martial law
[2:35:18.180 --> 2:35:20.180]  He didn't care, does that make sense?
[2:35:20.180 --> 2:35:22.180]  Absolutely, it makes sense and I agree with you
[2:35:22.180 --> 2:35:24.180]  100% on that, I just don't want Trump
[2:35:24.180 --> 2:35:26.180]  To get set up and then they call him
[2:35:26.180 --> 2:35:28.180]  The martial law advocate, the dictator
[2:35:28.180 --> 2:35:30.180]  And all that
[2:35:30.180 --> 2:35:32.180]  Oh, don't worry, he's already been set up
[2:35:32.180 --> 2:35:34.180]  They've already tried to steal the election, they've already done all this
[2:35:34.180 --> 2:35:36.180]  What if they set him up
[2:35:36.180 --> 2:35:38.180]  And then he declares martial law
[2:35:38.180 --> 2:35:40.180]  And then they assassinate him
[2:35:40.180 --> 2:35:42.180]  And we get one of these globalists in charge
[2:35:42.180 --> 2:35:44.180]  So it gets covered
[2:35:44.180 --> 2:35:46.180]  Yeah
[2:35:46.180 --> 2:35:48.180]  I appreciate your call
[2:35:48.180 --> 2:35:50.180]  Listen, I'm not trying to be condescending
[2:35:50.180 --> 2:35:52.180]  Here's what I'm getting at
[2:35:52.180 --> 2:35:54.180]  Everyone continues to act like we're still in a republic
[2:35:54.180 --> 2:35:56.180]  Everyone continues to act like
[2:35:56.180 --> 2:35:58.180]  We're already following the same system
[2:35:58.180 --> 2:36:00.180]  The country is in shambles
[2:36:00.180 --> 2:36:02.180]  We've been overtaken by outside bullies
[2:36:02.180 --> 2:36:04.180]  No one's showing strength
[2:36:04.180 --> 2:36:06.180]  Because a dictator shows strength
[2:36:06.180 --> 2:36:08.180]  So
[2:36:08.180 --> 2:36:10.180]  Our elected president doesn't show strength
[2:36:10.180 --> 2:36:12.180]  So Joe Biden and the Chai comms do
[2:36:12.180 --> 2:36:14.180]  And they take over
[2:36:14.180 --> 2:36:16.180]  See how that works
[2:36:16.180 --> 2:36:18.180]  That's how the real world works
[2:36:18.180 --> 2:36:20.180]  Not the fantasy way
[2:36:20.180 --> 2:36:22.180]  So don't worry
[2:36:22.180 --> 2:36:24.180]  If we don't show a big rally in DC
[2:36:24.180 --> 2:36:26.180]  And if we don't stand up
[2:36:26.180 --> 2:36:28.180]  And if we don't back the globalist off
[2:36:28.180 --> 2:36:30.180]  They're going to take us for everything we got
[2:36:30.180 --> 2:36:32.180]  And you're not going to have any American martial law
[2:36:32.180 --> 2:36:34.180]  You're going to have Chai comm globalist martial law
[2:36:34.180 --> 2:36:36.180]  More than you ever wanted
[2:36:36.180 --> 2:36:38.180]  And then you can sit there and debate
[2:36:38.180 --> 2:36:40.180]  How bad Trump is later
[2:36:40.180 --> 2:37:04.180]  It's been said that you should strike while the iron is hot
[2:37:04.180 --> 2:37:10.180]  That's why now is the time to contact local radio, TV and cable stations
[2:37:10.180 --> 2:37:12.180]  If you don't have an affiliate in your area already
[2:37:12.180 --> 2:37:14.180]  And to send them to infowars.com
[2:37:14.180 --> 2:37:16.180]  Forward slash affiliates
[2:37:16.180 --> 2:37:18.180]  And say, pick up Alex Jones, pick up Owen Schreuer
[2:37:18.180 --> 2:37:20.180]  Pick up David Knight, pick up her other great programs
[2:37:20.180 --> 2:37:22.180]  They're free to air
[2:37:22.180 --> 2:37:24.180]  If you're on TV or you're on cable
[2:37:24.180 --> 2:37:26.180]  You can cover up all the commercials for yourself
[2:37:26.180 --> 2:37:28.180]  No contracts needed, this is your authorization stations
[2:37:28.180 --> 2:37:30.180]  Pick up the info wars feed right now
[2:37:30.180 --> 2:37:32.180]  All the affiliates, the satellites
[2:37:32.180 --> 2:37:34.180]  It's all linked at infowars.com
[2:37:34.180 --> 2:37:36.180]  Forward slash affiliates
[2:37:36.180 --> 2:37:38.180]  Go to the local stations, call them
[2:37:38.180 --> 2:37:40.180]  Email them and send them the link to infowars.com
[2:37:40.180 --> 2:37:42.180]  Forward slash affiliates
[2:37:42.180 --> 2:37:44.180]  And tell them we're free to air
[2:37:44.180 --> 2:37:46.180]  No contracts, just pick us up
[2:37:46.180 --> 2:37:48.180]  Mr. Dictionary has a very simple definition
[2:37:48.180 --> 2:37:50.180]  Of terrorism
[2:37:50.180 --> 2:37:52.180]  Other dictionaries have similar ones
[2:37:52.180 --> 2:37:54.180]  Terrorism is the threat of force
[2:37:54.180 --> 2:37:56.180]  Or actually carrying out force
[2:37:56.180 --> 2:38:00.180]  For a political or financial reason
[2:38:00.180 --> 2:38:02.180]  Or basically scaring the hell out of people
[2:38:02.180 --> 2:38:04.180]  Until you submit to them
[2:38:04.180 --> 2:38:06.180]  That's exactly what all this overblown
[2:38:06.180 --> 2:38:08.180]  COVID-19 garbage is
[2:38:08.180 --> 2:38:10.180]  You see the headlines from CNN, ABC News
[2:38:10.180 --> 2:38:12.180]  Doctors say it's worse than they ever thought
[2:38:12.180 --> 2:38:14.180]  COVID more devastating than they could ever imagine
[2:38:14.180 --> 2:38:16.180]  They told us that
[2:38:16.180 --> 2:38:18.180]  Two and a half million people would be dead
[2:38:18.180 --> 2:38:20.180]  Just eight months ago
[2:38:20.180 --> 2:38:22.180]  Within three months
[2:38:22.180 --> 2:38:24.180]  It's a quarter million if you count
[2:38:24.180 --> 2:38:26.180]  All of the people that died of other things
[2:38:26.180 --> 2:38:28.180]  We're talking 96% at co-morbidity
[2:38:28.180 --> 2:38:30.180]  These are real numbers, these are real facts
[2:38:30.180 --> 2:38:32.180]  This is the chicken little event
[2:38:32.180 --> 2:38:34.180]  We all run our houses, never come out
[2:38:34.180 --> 2:38:36.180]  And are taught we're not essential
[2:38:36.180 --> 2:38:38.180]  All the big box stores in Amazon take over the planet
[2:38:38.180 --> 2:38:40.180]  You could stand up against it
[2:38:40.180 --> 2:38:42.180]  This is slavery
[2:38:42.180 --> 2:39:08.180]  It is not something you can put up with and survive
[2:39:08.180 --> 2:39:12.180]  And they're creating the process of getting rid of our old economy
[2:39:12.180 --> 2:39:14.180]  And the new economy where everything's free
[2:39:14.180 --> 2:39:16.180]  Because when you're a prisoner
[2:39:16.180 --> 2:39:18.180]  Well everything's free, but you're also a slave
[2:39:18.180 --> 2:39:20.180]  Scotland is going to have universal
[2:39:20.180 --> 2:39:22.180]  Guaranteed incomes now
[2:39:22.180 --> 2:39:24.180]  Of subsistence level
[2:39:24.180 --> 2:39:26.180]  But of course you've got to take those vaccines
[2:39:26.180 --> 2:39:28.180]  You can't have any kids
[2:39:28.180 --> 2:39:30.180]  Don't worry though, all of the tampons
[2:39:30.180 --> 2:39:32.180]  And stuff like that's free too as well
[2:39:32.180 --> 2:39:34.180]  I'm not kidding
[2:39:34.180 --> 2:39:36.180]  So they'll give you some free paper
[2:39:36.180 --> 2:39:38.180]  There's money to basically live in a tiny apartment
[2:39:38.180 --> 2:39:40.180]  But they own you, they control you
[2:39:40.180 --> 2:39:42.180]  That's the great reset
[2:39:42.180 --> 2:39:44.180]  That's why it's got to be resisted to total takeover
[2:39:44.180 --> 2:40:11.180]  And that's why it's got to be resisted
[2:40:11.180 --> 2:40:15.180]  This is economic domination
[2:40:15.180 --> 2:40:17.180]  This is economic war
[2:40:17.180 --> 2:40:19.180]  We're being consolidated, we're being taken over
[2:40:19.180 --> 2:40:21.180]  The Democrats aren't mismanaging their blue cities and states
[2:40:21.180 --> 2:40:23.180]  They're consolidating power and control
[2:40:23.180 --> 2:40:25.180]  To bankrupt the population
[2:40:25.180 --> 2:40:27.180]  And bring them absolutely to heal
[2:40:27.180 --> 2:40:29.180]  And then consolidate ownership of all the infrastructure
[2:40:29.180 --> 2:40:31.180]  And property
[2:40:31.180 --> 2:40:33.180]  This is a monopolistic takeover
[2:40:33.180 --> 2:40:35.180]  That's what the great reset is
[2:40:35.180 --> 2:40:37.180]  Cloud Schwab and these other criminals admit it
[2:40:37.180 --> 2:40:39.180]  That's what social distancing is
[2:40:39.180 --> 2:40:41.180]  So your business is only 25%
[2:40:41.180 --> 2:40:43.180]  For several more years
[2:40:43.180 --> 2:40:45.180]  No small businesses will be there
[2:40:45.180 --> 2:40:47.180]  This is a master plan, say no
[2:40:47.180 --> 2:40:51.180]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:41:05.180 --> 2:41:07.180]  Ladies and gentlemen
[2:41:07.180 --> 2:41:09.180]  I just got bone-chilling news
[2:41:09.180 --> 2:41:11.180]  During the break
[2:41:13.180 --> 2:41:15.180]  Ezra Revant is on the show tomorrow
[2:41:15.180 --> 2:41:17.180]  He's incredibly credible
[2:41:19.180 --> 2:41:21.180]  This is breaking minutes ago
[2:41:21.180 --> 2:41:23.180]  We're going to post it on infowars.com
[2:41:23.180 --> 2:41:25.180]  It's from Rebel News
[2:41:25.180 --> 2:41:27.180]  They have the internal emails
[2:41:27.180 --> 2:41:29.180]  They got this through FOIA
[2:41:29.180 --> 2:41:31.180]  Defense International
[2:41:31.180 --> 2:41:33.180]  Trudeau invited Chinese troops to occupy
[2:41:33.180 --> 2:41:35.180]  Canada
[2:41:35.180 --> 2:41:37.180]  I mean
[2:41:37.180 --> 2:41:39.180]  Oh, but that's okay
[2:41:39.180 --> 2:41:41.180]  As long as we don't have any martial law
[2:41:41.180 --> 2:41:43.180]  So I'm going to explain this to the last caller
[2:41:43.180 --> 2:41:45.180]  I'm going to explain it to other people
[2:41:45.180 --> 2:41:47.180]  Who actually know this
[2:41:47.180 --> 2:41:49.180]  But just want to act holier than now
[2:41:49.180 --> 2:41:51.180]  Because it's all about purity
[2:41:51.180 --> 2:41:53.180]  Like a Pharisee or a Sadducee
[2:41:53.180 --> 2:41:55.180]  I'm going to explain this to everybody real quick
[2:41:57.180 --> 2:41:59.180]  You can have civil county law
[2:41:59.180 --> 2:42:01.180]  Based on your state, based on the Constitution
[2:42:01.180 --> 2:42:03.180]  Which itself is based on common law
[2:42:03.180 --> 2:42:05.180]  And basic jurisprudence
[2:42:05.180 --> 2:42:07.180]  I'm not going to go over the whole lineage of it
[2:42:07.180 --> 2:42:09.180]  And where we are currently today
[2:42:09.180 --> 2:42:11.180]  If someone comes to your house
[2:42:11.180 --> 2:42:13.180]  And breaks in the back door
[2:42:13.180 --> 2:42:15.180]  And tackles your wife and starts raping her
[2:42:15.180 --> 2:42:17.180]  And they've got a handgun
[2:42:17.180 --> 2:42:19.180]  You pull out your gun and you shoot them
[2:42:19.180 --> 2:42:21.180]  And that is
[2:42:21.180 --> 2:42:23.180]  Your own common law action
[2:42:23.180 --> 2:42:25.180]  Of violence to protect yourself
[2:42:25.180 --> 2:42:27.180]  And you're protected
[2:42:27.180 --> 2:42:29.180]  So people fetishize the term
[2:42:29.180 --> 2:42:31.180]  Martial law
[2:42:31.180 --> 2:42:33.180]  It means different things in history
[2:42:33.180 --> 2:42:35.180]  Different places, but it means suspension
[2:42:35.180 --> 2:42:37.180]  Of the common regular law
[2:42:37.180 --> 2:42:39.180]  Well a lot of places are already under military rule
[2:42:39.180 --> 2:42:41.180]  So how do you have martial law
[2:42:41.180 --> 2:42:43.180]  Something that's already martial
[2:42:43.180 --> 2:42:45.180]  When the county and city and state laws
[2:42:45.180 --> 2:42:47.180]  Are suspended by bureaucrats
[2:42:47.180 --> 2:42:49.180]  By dictator governors
[2:42:49.180 --> 2:42:51.180]  Whether it's Whitmer or Newsom
[2:42:51.180 --> 2:42:53.180]  Or Cuomo
[2:42:53.180 --> 2:42:55.180]  Or Wolfe
[2:42:55.180 --> 2:42:57.180]  Or prime ministers
[2:42:57.180 --> 2:42:59.180]  Like Boris Johnson
[2:43:01.180 --> 2:43:03.180]  And then they announce the militaries out
[2:43:03.180 --> 2:43:05.180]  To give inoculations and checkpoints and IDs
[2:43:05.180 --> 2:43:07.180]  That's classic martial law
[2:43:07.180 --> 2:43:09.180]  And it's a medical
[2:43:09.180 --> 2:43:11.180]  Martial law
[2:43:11.180 --> 2:43:13.180]  One of the nastiest, deadliest types
[2:43:13.180 --> 2:43:15.180]  And when the states put out
[2:43:15.180 --> 2:43:17.180]  80 million fake ballots
[2:43:17.180 --> 2:43:19.180]  And break all the rules and violate the law
[2:43:19.180 --> 2:43:21.180]  And declare their own system
[2:43:21.180 --> 2:43:23.180]  That is a form of revolution
[2:43:23.180 --> 2:43:25.180]  A declaration of independence
[2:43:25.180 --> 2:43:27.180]  Martial law
[2:43:27.180 --> 2:43:29.180]  And so when we declared 1776
[2:43:29.180 --> 2:43:31.180]  The king of England said
[2:43:31.180 --> 2:43:33.180]  That's a rogue state
[2:43:33.180 --> 2:43:35.180]  That's a military dictatorship
[2:43:35.180 --> 2:43:37.180]  They're setting up because the military was formed
[2:43:37.180 --> 2:43:39.180]  To say we're forming a new system
[2:43:39.180 --> 2:43:41.180]  And the first thing you do
[2:43:41.180 --> 2:43:43.180]  Is make the declaration of what you plan to do
[2:43:43.180 --> 2:43:45.180]  And then form your military
[2:43:45.180 --> 2:43:47.180]  To oppose the other side
[2:43:47.180 --> 2:43:49.180]  And to establish your own order
[2:43:51.180 --> 2:43:53.180]  And so when we're faced
[2:43:53.180 --> 2:43:55.180]  With an outside Chinese
[2:43:55.180 --> 2:43:57.180]  Globalist fraudulent takeover
[2:43:57.180 --> 2:43:59.180]  And they're putting their people in
[2:43:59.180 --> 2:44:01.180]  It is a logical extension
[2:44:01.180 --> 2:44:03.180]  For a military general
[2:44:03.180 --> 2:44:05.180]  Or constitutional lawyer
[2:44:05.180 --> 2:44:07.180]  Or federal prosecutor
[2:44:07.180 --> 2:44:09.180]  Like
[2:44:09.180 --> 2:44:11.180]  Powell
[2:44:11.180 --> 2:44:13.180]  To come out and say
[2:44:13.180 --> 2:44:15.180]  We need a limited form of martial law
[2:44:15.180 --> 2:44:17.180]  Because the congress won't act
[2:44:17.180 --> 2:44:19.180]  The states won't act
[2:44:19.180 --> 2:44:21.180]  The bureaucracy is controlled
[2:44:21.180 --> 2:44:23.180]  The justice department will do nothing
[2:44:23.180 --> 2:44:25.180]  I don't have any more faith in the military
[2:44:25.180 --> 2:44:27.180]  Either to carry out that martial law
[2:44:27.180 --> 2:44:29.180]  Because it has to have a people
[2:44:29.180 --> 2:44:31.180]  That stand for an ethos
[2:44:31.180 --> 2:44:33.180]  And an idea and a mission
[2:44:33.180 --> 2:44:35.180]  And a demand of what they want
[2:44:35.180 --> 2:44:37.180]  Declaration of independence
[2:44:37.180 --> 2:44:39.180]  So what I've called for
[2:44:39.180 --> 2:44:41.180]  Is a declaration of independence
[2:44:41.180 --> 2:44:43.180]  Against this fraudulent election
[2:44:43.180 --> 2:44:45.180]  And against the chai comms
[2:44:45.180 --> 2:44:47.180]  And against the globalist
[2:44:47.180 --> 2:44:49.180]  And then callers call and say
[2:44:49.180 --> 2:44:51.180]  Why do you want martial law?
[2:44:51.180 --> 2:44:53.180]  You just want to say
[2:44:53.180 --> 2:44:55.180]  I'm doing that so you feel powerful
[2:44:55.180 --> 2:44:57.180]  All right
[2:44:57.180 --> 2:44:59.180]  I'm talking about a real
[2:44:59.180 --> 2:45:01.180]  World here, we are overrun
[2:45:01.180 --> 2:45:03.180]  We have a foreign
[2:45:03.180 --> 2:45:05.180]  Controlled media demoralizing us
[2:45:05.180 --> 2:45:07.180]  It's the
[2:45:07.180 --> 2:45:09.180]  Stinking military that's going to be out there
[2:45:09.180 --> 2:45:11.180]  Doing the damn inoculations
[2:45:11.180 --> 2:45:13.180]  Trump bought into all that crap
[2:45:13.180 --> 2:45:15.180]  Yeah, he just
[2:45:15.180 --> 2:45:17.180]  Tweeted overrun
[2:45:17.180 --> 2:45:19.180]  Holy hell
[2:45:19.180 --> 2:45:21.180]  Didn't even know he'd done that
[2:45:21.180 --> 2:45:23.180]  We are overrun folks
[2:45:23.180 --> 2:45:25.180]  And
[2:45:25.180 --> 2:45:27.180]  In discussion
[2:45:27.180 --> 2:45:29.180]  The military work colleges here
[2:45:29.180 --> 2:45:31.180]  The only legitimate martial law would be
[2:45:31.180 --> 2:45:33.180]  Under a foreign occupation or overrun
[2:45:33.180 --> 2:45:35.180]  Because then you're not having courts
[2:45:35.180 --> 2:45:37.180]  And trials and doing all the normal
[2:45:37.180 --> 2:45:39.180]  Pleasantries when they're breaking in your house
[2:45:39.180 --> 2:45:41.180]  When they're raping your wife
[2:45:41.180 --> 2:45:43.180]  When your city's on fire
[2:45:43.180 --> 2:45:45.180]  When the electricity's getting turned off
[2:45:45.180 --> 2:45:47.180]  When the farms are collapsing
[2:45:47.180 --> 2:45:49.180]  Because that's all that's coming next
[2:45:49.180 --> 2:45:51.180]  The key of the city and a magic wand of martial law
[2:45:51.180 --> 2:45:53.180]  I'm saying
[2:45:53.180 --> 2:45:55.180]  Recognize we are under
[2:45:55.180 --> 2:45:57.180]  Martial law now of the
[2:45:57.180 --> 2:45:59.180]  UN and the medical tyranny
[2:45:59.180 --> 2:46:01.180]  And Bill Gates
[2:46:01.180 --> 2:46:03.180]  We are under martial law
[2:46:03.180 --> 2:46:05.180]  We are under martial law
[2:46:05.180 --> 2:46:07.180]  We are under
[2:46:07.180 --> 2:46:09.180]  Martial law
[2:46:09.180 --> 2:46:11.180]  Face that
[2:46:11.180 --> 2:46:13.180]  Deal with that
[2:46:15.180 --> 2:46:17.180]  Not the fears that are
[2:46:17.180 --> 2:46:19.180]  Got some good rhetoric
[2:46:19.180 --> 2:46:21.180]  And tried to turn the energy back on
[2:46:21.180 --> 2:46:23.180]  And try to do a better financial deal for us
[2:46:23.180 --> 2:46:25.180]  The fears that the completely
[2:46:25.180 --> 2:46:27.180]  Surrounded collapsing champion
[2:46:27.180 --> 2:46:29.180]  Is gonna be a dictator
[2:46:29.180 --> 2:46:31.180]  Don't worry that probably
[2:46:31.180 --> 2:46:33.180]  Ain't gonna happen
[2:46:35.180 --> 2:46:37.180]  But so long
[2:46:37.180 --> 2:46:39.180]  Is the instinct
[2:46:39.180 --> 2:46:41.180]  And the energy
[2:46:41.180 --> 2:46:43.180]  To think of America
[2:46:43.180 --> 2:46:45.180]  And Bill Clinton
[2:46:45.180 --> 2:46:47.180]  And Barack Obama
[2:46:47.180 --> 2:46:49.180]  And George Bush Sr
[2:46:49.180 --> 2:46:51.180]  And all of them that put in the martial law
[2:46:51.180 --> 2:46:53.180]  Slowly and that took our rights
[2:46:53.180 --> 2:46:55.180]  And that tried to train the military for martial law
[2:46:55.180 --> 2:46:57.180]  So they warned us they were being trained
[2:46:57.180 --> 2:46:59.180]  So we wrote the
[2:46:59.180 --> 2:47:01.180]  Book on martial law
[2:47:01.180 --> 2:47:03.180]  Literally made the films
[2:47:03.180 --> 2:47:05.180]  On martial law went out
[2:47:05.180 --> 2:47:07.180]  And documented the martial law
[2:47:07.180 --> 2:47:09.180]  So that they the outside force
[2:47:09.180 --> 2:47:11.180]  Would not use our military against us
[2:47:11.180 --> 2:47:13.180]  So instead
[2:47:13.180 --> 2:47:15.180]  They got control of our local cities
[2:47:15.180 --> 2:47:17.180]  And they brought in a virus of fear
[2:47:17.180 --> 2:47:19.180]  And they domesticated us
[2:47:19.180 --> 2:47:21.180]  And they taught us through corporations
[2:47:21.180 --> 2:47:23.180]  To hide in our homes and never come back out again
[2:47:23.180 --> 2:47:25.180]  And it is a martial law of the mind
[2:47:27.180 --> 2:47:29.180]  90% of war
[2:47:29.180 --> 2:47:31.180]  Is a psychological operation
[2:47:33.180 --> 2:47:35.180]  So all I want is
[2:47:35.180 --> 2:47:37.180]  The people criticizing
[2:47:37.180 --> 2:47:39.180]  Flynn or anybody saying we need limited martial law
[2:47:39.180 --> 2:47:41.180]  Which is a response
[2:47:41.180 --> 2:47:43.180]  To a foreign overrun takeover
[2:47:43.180 --> 2:47:45.180]  Which is true
[2:47:45.180 --> 2:47:47.180]  It doesn't mean it can be implemented
[2:47:47.180 --> 2:47:49.180]  It doesn't mean it's even a good idea
[2:47:49.180 --> 2:47:51.180]  Because we don't have arms and legs
[2:47:51.180 --> 2:47:53.180]  We're like a head separated from our body
[2:47:53.180 --> 2:47:55.180]  We don't even have those forces
[2:47:55.180 --> 2:47:57.180]  Our military is in Utah right now
[2:47:57.180 --> 2:47:59.180]  The Green Berets
[2:47:59.180 --> 2:48:01.180]  Literally learning how to suck dick
[2:48:01.180 --> 2:48:03.180]  Excuse me and delay that
[2:48:03.180 --> 2:48:05.180]  I mean that's what this has become
[2:48:05.180 --> 2:48:07.180]  And the sooner people realize
[2:48:07.180 --> 2:48:09.180]  That the better shot we've got in the future
[2:48:11.180 --> 2:48:13.180]  I'm going to go to break
[2:48:13.180 --> 2:48:15.180]  I'm going to do two more segments
[2:48:15.180 --> 2:48:17.180]  I'm going to go to David Isaac Hayes
[2:48:17.180 --> 2:48:19.180]  Chris Bob and Chris in Kentucky
[2:48:19.180 --> 2:48:21.180]  And that's it for calls, I love you
[2:48:21.180 --> 2:48:23.180]  I'll get to every damn one of those calls
[2:48:23.180 --> 2:48:25.180]  Separately, I've got to find my operation
[2:48:25.180 --> 2:48:27.180]  This has been sold out for two or three months
[2:48:27.180 --> 2:48:29.180]  With the highest quality little
[2:48:29.180 --> 2:48:31.180]  Mini Faraday cages in green
[2:48:31.180 --> 2:48:33.180]  Blue, black and red
[2:48:33.180 --> 2:48:35.180]  They're basic sizes of droids
[2:48:35.180 --> 2:48:37.180]  And iPhones and when they're in here
[2:48:37.180 --> 2:48:39.180]  You don't get the radiation from it
[2:48:39.180 --> 2:48:41.180]  When they're pinging it back and forth
[2:48:41.180 --> 2:48:43.180]  It doesn't track your location for the globalists
[2:48:43.180 --> 2:48:45.180]  The hackers, the contact tracers
[2:48:45.180 --> 2:48:47.180]  The Clinton Foundation
[2:48:47.180 --> 2:48:49.180]  And it just gets you to use the phone less
[2:48:49.180 --> 2:48:51.180]  I notice when I remember to use these
[2:48:51.180 --> 2:48:53.180]  I'll do it for a few months then forget
[2:48:53.180 --> 2:48:55.180]  And then go back to it because my kids take it
[2:48:55.180 --> 2:48:57.180]  Or whatever happens or I lose it
[2:48:57.180 --> 2:48:59.180]  Then it makes me use the phone less
[2:48:59.180 --> 2:49:01.180]  Spend more time with family and be aware of how we're all being tracked
[2:49:01.180 --> 2:49:03.180]  With privacy pockets back in
[2:49:03.180 --> 2:49:05.180]  At the lowest price, these similar units
[2:49:05.180 --> 2:49:07.180]  The same unit sold for $29.95
[2:49:07.180 --> 2:49:09.180]  We're selling them for $19.95
[2:49:09.180 --> 2:49:11.180]  They cost us $11 a piece
[2:49:11.180 --> 2:49:13.180]  They are high quality
[2:49:13.180 --> 2:49:15.180]  Infowarsstore.com, they got the copper lining
[2:49:15.180 --> 2:49:17.180]  That is a great stocking stuff

[2:49:35.180 --> 2:49:37.180]  We're getting taken over right now
[2:49:37.180 --> 2:49:39.180]  And we're sitting there refereeing ourselves
[2:49:39.180 --> 2:49:41.180]  Saying, oh, we better not do this
[2:49:41.180 --> 2:49:43.180]  Just don't worry, there ain't no magic martial law
[2:49:43.180 --> 2:49:45.180]  And all that Q stuff coming, okay?
[2:49:45.180 --> 2:49:47.180]  Don't hold your breath
[2:49:49.180 --> 2:49:51.180]  You're under Chai Kong martial law now
[2:49:51.180 --> 2:49:53.180]  But no one will lift a finger to even speak out against it
[2:49:53.180 --> 2:49:55.180]  Because that's liberal
[2:49:55.180 --> 2:49:57.180]  I mean, it's Chinese martial law
[2:49:57.180 --> 2:49:59.180]  But it must be okay, you know?
[2:49:59.180 --> 2:50:01.180]  I mean, how dare you not want them to occupy
[2:50:01.180 --> 2:50:03.180]  Canada, I mean, you know, this is a

[2:50:31.180 --> 2:50:33.180]  Because who knows, with the supply chain breakdowns
[2:50:33.180 --> 2:50:35.180]  And things that are happening, we'll be able to get product
[2:50:35.180 --> 2:50:37.180]  In three months, six months
[2:50:37.180 --> 2:50:39.180]  They're planning a long, hard depression
[2:50:39.180 --> 2:50:41.180]  And never take that boot off your neck again
[2:50:41.180 --> 2:50:43.180]  All right, and I know it'll be
[2:50:43.180 --> 2:50:45.180]  Biden's martial law, so everybody's going to love it
[2:50:45.180 --> 2:50:47.180]  Not going to call martial law, you're going to enjoy it
[2:50:47.180 --> 2:50:49.180]  But I'm trying as hard as I can to stop it
[2:50:49.180 --> 2:50:51.180]  And God bless the state of Texas again
[2:50:51.180 --> 2:50:53.180]  Coming through with the right lawsuit
[2:50:53.180 --> 2:50:55.180]  To reverse this, and let the left burn the cities
[2:50:55.180 --> 2:50:57.180]  Down to throw fits, they're a bunch of damn commies
[2:50:57.180 --> 2:50:59.180]  Anyways, I didn't mean to have that one caller
[2:50:59.180 --> 2:51:01.180]  Set me off there
[2:51:01.180 --> 2:51:03.180]  This is just a completely insane situation
[2:51:03.180 --> 2:51:05.180]  And yeah, they're trying to go Trump
[2:51:05.180 --> 2:51:07.180]  Into an over-response, but it doesn't matter
[2:51:07.180 --> 2:51:09.180]  No response is another response
[2:51:09.180 --> 2:51:11.180]  But he's surrounded by a bunch of
[2:51:11.180 --> 2:51:13.180]  Candy-ass lawyers, so let's just stop worrying
[2:51:13.180 --> 2:51:15.180]  About Trump saving us, and let's ourselves
[2:51:15.180 --> 2:51:17.180]  Say we don't accept Joe Biden, and we don't
[2:51:17.180 --> 2:51:19.180]  Accept the New World Order, and we don't accept
[2:51:19.180 --> 2:51:21.180]  Political correctness, and we don't listen to a damn thing
[2:51:21.180 --> 2:51:23.180]  We don't sell us anymore, and we don't battle
[2:51:23.180 --> 2:51:25.180]  All their pedophile armies, may they burn in hell
[2:51:25.180 --> 2:51:27.180]  Ah!
[2:51:27.180 --> 2:51:29.180]  Hour number four
[2:51:29.180 --> 2:51:31.180]  Your phone calls straight ahead
[2:51:31.180 --> 2:51:33.180]  Infowars.com
[2:51:35.180 --> 2:51:37.180]  Cognitive dissonance
[2:51:37.180 --> 2:51:39.180]  Is a major issue amongst the left
[2:51:39.180 --> 2:51:41.180]  It can be very stressful
[2:51:41.180 --> 2:51:43.180]  Dealing with facts you refuse to accept
[2:51:43.180 --> 2:51:45.180]  If you have a family member
[2:51:45.180 --> 2:51:47.180]  Suffering from this degenerative
[2:51:47.180 --> 2:51:49.180]  Mental condition, buy them a bottle
[2:51:49.180 --> 2:51:51.180]  Of ultimate fish oil from
[2:51:51.180 --> 2:51:53.180]  Infowarsstore.com
[2:51:53.180 --> 2:51:55.180]  Studies have suggested that
[2:51:55.180 --> 2:51:57.180]  Fish oils and fish oil supplementation
[2:51:57.180 --> 2:51:59.180]  Can slightly lower blood pressure
[2:51:59.180 --> 2:52:01.180]  Decrease triglyceride levels
[2:52:01.180 --> 2:52:03.180]  Decrease the growth rate of plaque
[2:52:03.180 --> 2:52:05.180]  And provide a soothing reduction
[2:52:05.180 --> 2:52:07.180]  In inflammatory responses
[2:52:07.180 --> 2:52:09.180]  In joints and the digestive system
[2:52:09.180 --> 2:52:11.180]  Recent studies have suggested
[2:52:11.180 --> 2:52:13.180]  That high EPA and DHA
[2:52:13.180 --> 2:52:15.180]  Fish oil can stimulate
[2:52:15.180 --> 2:52:17.180]  Immune function by increasing
[2:52:17.180 --> 2:52:19.180]  The concentration and activity
[2:52:19.180 --> 2:52:21.180]  Of immune cells
[2:52:21.180 --> 2:52:23.180]  It worked for my family
[2:52:23.180 --> 2:52:25.180]  And now I can have a logical and calm
[2:52:25.180 --> 2:52:27.180]  Discussion about actual facts
[2:52:27.180 --> 2:52:29.180]  That pertain to reality
[2:52:29.180 --> 2:52:31.180]  Get your ultimate fish oil
[2:52:31.180 --> 2:52:33.180]  For a friend, family member, or yourself
[2:52:33.180 --> 2:52:35.180]  At Infowarsstore.com
[2:52:37.180 --> 2:52:39.180]  The project for world government
[2:52:39.180 --> 2:52:41.180]  Developed by the British Empire via Cecil Rhodes
[2:52:41.180 --> 2:52:43.180]  Then picked up by the Rockefeller family
[2:52:43.180 --> 2:52:45.180]  In the major Robert Barron's The Planet
[2:52:45.180 --> 2:52:47.180]  In the 1920s, it's all about
[2:52:47.180 --> 2:52:49.180]  Corporate global governance
[2:52:49.180 --> 2:52:51.180]  And now you're seeing it, such as the
[2:52:51.180 --> 2:52:53.180]  Blue States, the Blue Cities, the
[2:52:53.180 --> 2:52:55.180]  Communists and Socialist nations all
[2:52:55.180 --> 2:52:57.180]  Working in unison under UN control
[2:52:57.180 --> 2:52:59.180]  Established a medical planetary
[2:52:59.180 --> 2:53:01.180]  Dictatorship. At the core of it is
[2:53:01.180 --> 2:53:03.180]  The Fortune 100 corporations
[2:53:03.180 --> 2:53:05.180]  Themselves funded by a handful
[2:53:05.180 --> 2:53:07.180]  Of private central banking families
[2:53:07.180 --> 2:53:09.180]  The Rothschilds, the Rockefellers
[2:53:09.180 --> 2:53:11.180]  The Dutch and British royalty
[2:53:11.180 --> 2:53:13.180]  Think of the very heart of that
[2:53:13.180 --> 2:53:15.180]  British at the same time
[2:53:15.180 --> 2:53:17.180]  But they go back to the literal count
[2:53:17.180 --> 2:53:19.180]  Dracula and the wars
[2:53:19.180 --> 2:53:21.180]  In between Christendom and
[2:53:21.180 --> 2:53:23.180]  Islam. Those that don't know
[2:53:23.180 --> 2:53:25.180]  History really are doomed to repeat it
[2:53:25.180 --> 2:53:27.180]  They're involved in poting the
[2:53:27.180 --> 2:53:29.180]  World economy. That's what the
[2:53:29.180 --> 2:53:31.180]  Social distancing, the masks are all about
[2:53:31.180 --> 2:53:33.180]  It's about bankrupting local small businesses
[2:53:33.180 --> 2:53:35.180]  And those that comply, are complying
[2:53:35.180 --> 2:53:45.180]  To the destruction. Wake up.
[2:54:05.180 --> 2:54:07.180]  Michigan State Rep Cynthia Johnson
[2:54:07.180 --> 2:54:09.180]  Who said we're going to basically
[2:54:09.180 --> 2:54:11.180]  Attack and destroy anybody
[2:54:11.180 --> 2:54:13.180]  That questions election fraud
[2:54:13.180 --> 2:54:15.180]  She just downed her investigation
[2:54:15.180 --> 2:54:17.180]  And just got stripped of her assignments
[2:54:17.180 --> 2:54:19.180]  These people are all just thugs. We're going to play that next segment.
[2:54:19.180 --> 2:54:21.180]  Let's go to the calls. Thank you David
[2:54:21.180 --> 2:54:23.180]  In Virginia. Sorry I had some episodes
[2:54:23.180 --> 2:54:25.180]  Earlier. You're on the air. Go ahead
[2:54:25.180 --> 2:54:27.180]  No problem. Alex, great to talk to you.
[2:54:27.180 --> 2:54:29.180]  I'm a long time
[2:54:29.180 --> 2:54:31.180]  Lister and first time caller. I was in
[2:54:31.180 --> 2:54:33.180]  DC a few weeks ago and I'll be there this
[2:54:33.180 --> 2:54:35.180]  Week and look forward to seeing you.
[2:54:35.180 --> 2:54:37.180]  First thing I wanted to do, I'd like
[2:54:37.180 --> 2:54:39.180]  To plug your products.
[2:54:39.180 --> 2:54:41.180]  I love X2.
[2:54:41.180 --> 2:54:43.180]  It's done a lot of great
[2:54:43.180 --> 2:54:45.180]  I've achieved a lot of great
[2:54:45.180 --> 2:54:47.180]  Results in taking it.
[2:54:47.180 --> 2:54:49.180]  So what
[2:54:49.180 --> 2:54:51.180]  I wanted to do, I wanted to touch on
[2:54:51.180 --> 2:54:53.180]  Martial law and
[2:54:53.180 --> 2:54:55.180]  Kind of the how around
[2:54:55.180 --> 2:54:57.180]  Martial law. I think
[2:54:57.180 --> 2:54:59.180]  You know, Trump
[2:54:59.180 --> 2:55:01.180]  Trump
[2:55:01.180 --> 2:55:03.180]  Obviously should pursue
[2:55:03.180 --> 2:55:05.180]  All his legal strategies
[2:55:05.180 --> 2:55:07.180]  But if he comes up short there
[2:55:07.180 --> 2:55:09.180]  I think Martial law is
[2:55:09.180 --> 2:55:11.180]  Something, an option that needs to be kept
[2:55:11.180 --> 2:55:13.180]  On the table. Well, yeah, because it's a
[2:55:13.180 --> 2:55:15.180]  Chicom foreign takeover. I mean
[2:55:15.180 --> 2:55:17.180]  If the damn Russians invaded, what would you call that?
[2:55:17.180 --> 2:55:19.180]  People need to understand this is where we are
[2:55:19.180 --> 2:55:21.180]  Absolutely.
[2:55:21.180 --> 2:55:23.180]  But the how, how he can do it.
[2:55:23.180 --> 2:55:25.180]  There's a law, US Code 10
[2:55:25.180 --> 2:55:27.180]  Section 253
[2:55:27.180 --> 2:55:29.180]  Which
[2:55:29.180 --> 2:55:31.180]  Trump can invoke to
[2:55:31.180 --> 2:55:33.180]  Activate militias across the country
[2:55:33.180 --> 2:55:35.180]  And
[2:55:35.180 --> 2:55:37.180]  These militias, citizen militias
[2:55:37.180 --> 2:55:39.180]  Would therefore, thereby
[2:55:39.180 --> 2:55:41.180]  Be operating under a legal framework
[2:55:41.180 --> 2:55:43.180]  I agree. I just want to call this global
[2:55:43.180 --> 2:55:45.180]  A spluff. They're doing this because they can push
[2:55:45.180 --> 2:55:47.180]  Us around. America didn't used to get
[2:55:47.180 --> 2:55:49.180]  Pushed around. I'm sick of being pushed around
[2:55:49.180 --> 2:55:51.180]  I think we could
[2:55:51.180 --> 2:55:53.180]  Literally see millions of
[2:55:53.180 --> 2:55:55.180]  Citizens under arms
[2:55:55.180 --> 2:55:57.180]  On the streets
[2:55:57.180 --> 2:55:59.180]  Across this country and to take
[2:55:59.180 --> 2:56:01.180]  I'm just telling you, the globalists tried to put out
[2:56:01.180 --> 2:56:03.180]  Their commie force to intimidate us
[2:56:03.180 --> 2:56:05.180]  We're not going to intimidate them. We're going to protect
[2:56:05.180 --> 2:56:07.180]  Legitimate government and legitimate
[2:56:07.180 --> 2:56:09.180]  Homes and we're not getting pushed around anymore
[2:56:09.180 --> 2:56:11.180]  Absolutely. Anyway, there's
[2:56:11.180 --> 2:56:13.180]  Interesting couple of videos
[2:56:13.180 --> 2:56:15.180]  We are under attack
[2:56:15.180 --> 2:56:17.180]  We are in a state of war. Call it
[2:56:17.180 --> 2:56:19.180]  What you want. Call out the Republic
[2:56:19.180 --> 2:56:21.180]  Defend the damn Republic
[2:56:21.180 --> 2:56:23.180]  Period.
[2:56:23.180 --> 2:56:25.180]  There's an interesting couple
[2:56:25.180 --> 2:56:27.180]  Of videos by Harvard educated
[2:56:27.180 --> 2:56:29.180]  Lawyer, Dr. Edwin Vieira
[2:56:29.180 --> 2:56:31.180]  Who explains
[2:56:31.180 --> 2:56:33.180]  I agree. Let's get Vieira. He's a great lawyer
[2:56:33.180 --> 2:56:35.180]  On. I agree with you. God bless you, David
[2:56:35.180 --> 2:56:37.180]  All right. Yeah. Again, I'm not fetishizing
[2:56:37.180 --> 2:56:39.180]  Martial law. It's a term
[2:56:39.180 --> 2:56:41.180]  A federal executive
[2:56:41.180 --> 2:56:43.180]  Response to the foreign takeover
[2:56:43.180 --> 2:56:45.180]  Defend us. Damn it
[2:56:45.180 --> 2:56:47.180]  We have to call it out
[2:56:47.180 --> 2:56:49.180]  As a foreign attack it is
[2:56:49.180 --> 2:56:51.180]  I'm getting really pissed now, folks
[2:56:51.180 --> 2:56:53.180]  All right. Let's go to Chris in Kentucky
[2:56:53.180 --> 2:56:55.180]  Thanks for holding Chris and Hayes and others
[2:56:57.180 --> 2:56:59.180]  Hey, Alex. I know
[2:56:59.180 --> 2:57:01.180]  I guess I've got a spiritual and
[2:57:01.180 --> 2:57:03.180]  Mental tug of war going on with
[2:57:03.180 --> 2:57:05.180]  What's happening nationally
[2:57:05.180 --> 2:57:07.180]  And what's happening locally
[2:57:07.180 --> 2:57:09.180]  I live in Kentucky
[2:57:09.180 --> 2:57:11.180]  Where
[2:57:11.180 --> 2:57:13.180]  Governor Andy Bashir has
[2:57:13.180 --> 2:57:15.180]  Become our COVID overlord
[2:57:15.180 --> 2:57:17.180]  And
[2:57:17.180 --> 2:57:19.180]  Something interesting that's came up in a lot of these
[2:57:19.180 --> 2:57:21.180]  Hearings is there's been an individual
[2:57:21.180 --> 2:57:23.180]  And I don't know his name
[2:57:23.180 --> 2:57:25.180]  Or another organization he's connected with
[2:57:25.180 --> 2:57:27.180]  But he said that he got involved
[2:57:27.180 --> 2:57:29.180]  In investigating
[2:57:29.180 --> 2:57:31.180]  Election fraud with these voting machines
[2:57:33.180 --> 2:57:35.180]  Because
[2:57:35.180 --> 2:57:37.180]  Of the irregularities
[2:57:37.180 --> 2:57:39.180]  That happened in the Kentucky Governor's race
[2:57:39.180 --> 2:57:41.180]  Super bad. Super bad
[2:57:41.180 --> 2:57:43.180]  And I remember
[2:57:43.180 --> 2:57:45.180]  You guys covering some
[2:57:45.180 --> 2:57:47.180]  Of the details of that at the time
[2:57:47.180 --> 2:57:49.180]  But, you know, I think
[2:57:49.180 --> 2:57:51.180]  I think these people need to be accountable
[2:57:51.180 --> 2:57:53.180]  Okay
[2:57:53.180 --> 2:57:55.180]  And
[2:57:55.180 --> 2:57:57.180]  All these
[2:57:57.180 --> 2:57:59.180]  Democratic governors
[2:57:59.180 --> 2:58:01.180]  They're acting in concert
[2:58:01.180 --> 2:58:03.180]  It's like I want to know who the conductor is
[2:58:03.180 --> 2:58:05.180]  And who's paying them
[2:58:05.180 --> 2:58:07.180]  To play the music
[2:58:07.180 --> 2:58:09.180]  I can tell you it's the Clintons
[2:58:09.180 --> 2:58:11.180]  It's Obama, it's George Soros
[2:58:11.180 --> 2:58:13.180]  It's Brennan and Clapper
[2:58:13.180 --> 2:58:15.180]  It's a whole consortium
[2:58:15.180 --> 2:58:17.180]  Of scumbags
[2:58:17.180 --> 2:58:19.180]  Yeah, I mean
[2:58:19.180 --> 2:58:21.180]  It's like they're all
[2:58:21.180 --> 2:58:23.180]  Taking notes from each other and doing the exact same thing
[2:58:23.180 --> 2:58:25.180]  I mean, my wife is a kindergarten teacher
[2:58:25.180 --> 2:58:27.180]  Hold on, stay there
[2:58:27.180 --> 2:58:29.180]  Back in 60 seconds, Chris
[2:58:29.180 --> 2:58:31.180]  We'll get to Isaac, Hayes, Chris and Bob
[2:58:31.180 --> 2:58:33.180]  I promise, all of you before the segment ends
[2:58:33.180 --> 2:58:35.180]  And then great investigative journalist is coming up
[2:58:35.180 --> 2:58:37.180]  Comrade Report on MorphakeNews.com
[2:58:37.180 --> 2:58:39.180]  Please stay with us, this is really important
[2:58:39.180 --> 2:58:41.180]  I've got some really exciting
[2:58:41.180 --> 2:58:43.180]  Good news
[2:58:43.180 --> 2:58:45.180]  And I've also got some bad news
[2:58:45.180 --> 2:58:47.180]  Info Wars is getting the
[2:58:47.180 --> 2:58:49.180]  Highest traffic we have ever gotten
[2:58:49.180 --> 2:58:51.180]  Since
[2:58:51.180 --> 2:58:53.180]  The election in 2016
[2:58:53.180 --> 2:58:55.180]  Despite all the bands
[2:58:55.180 --> 2:58:57.180]  All of the system trying to
[2:58:57.180 --> 2:58:59.180]  Sense the rest and suppress us
[2:58:59.180 --> 2:59:01.180]  You with your word of mouth have
[2:59:01.180 --> 2:59:03.180]  Overwritten that
[2:59:03.180 --> 2:59:05.180]  And they are so scared of InfoWars.com
[2:59:05.180 --> 2:59:07.180]  In band.video
[2:59:07.180 --> 2:59:09.180]  They're scared of you being able to communicate
[2:59:09.180 --> 2:59:11.180]  And share the truth
[2:59:11.180 --> 2:59:13.180]  But we're bringing in the same amount of money
[2:59:13.180 --> 2:59:15.180]  We brought in last December right now
[2:59:15.180 --> 2:59:17.180]  This is our most important month
[2:59:17.180 --> 2:59:19.180]  To be able to fund ourselves in the next year
[2:59:19.180 --> 2:59:21.180]  And I understand the economy is shut down
[2:59:21.180 --> 2:59:23.180]  I understand there's not as much money as they used to be
[2:59:23.180 --> 2:59:25.180]  They're trying to kill Trump's recovery
[2:59:25.180 --> 2:59:27.180]  But Info Wars really needs your support
[2:59:27.180 --> 2:59:29.180]  You just buy great items
[2:59:29.180 --> 2:59:31.180]  Do your Christmas shopping at InfoWars.com
[2:59:31.180 --> 2:59:33.180]  With huge sales, amazing products
[2:59:33.180 --> 2:59:35.180]  And then you know you're funding the Info War
[2:59:35.180 --> 2:59:37.180]  And the globalists that are openly trying
[2:59:37.180 --> 2:59:39.180]  Destroy small businesses
[2:59:39.180 --> 2:59:41.180]  Continue to fund the Second American Revolution
[2:59:41.180 --> 2:59:43.180]  Or getting great products at the same time
[2:59:43.180 --> 2:59:45.180]  At InfoWars.com
[2:59:45.180 --> 2:59:47.180]  Thank you
[2:59:47.180 --> 2:59:49.180]  Big Brother
[2:59:49.180 --> 2:59:51.180]  Mainstream media
[2:59:51.180 --> 2:59:53.180]  Government coverups
[2:59:53.180 --> 2:59:55.180]  You want to stop tyranny?
[2:59:55.180 --> 2:59:57.180]  Well so does he
[2:59:57.180 --> 2:59:59.180]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios
[2:59:59.180 --> 3:00:01.180]  It's Alex Jones
[3:00:01.180 --> 3:00:03.180]  America is under a globalist attack
[3:00:03.180 --> 3:00:05.180]  They've got collaborators
[3:00:05.180 --> 3:00:07.180]  They think we're weak, they think we're stupid
[3:00:07.180 --> 3:00:09.180]  They're using COVID as the pretext to keep us locked down
[3:00:09.180 --> 3:00:11.180]  China's bragging they're totally open for business
[3:00:11.180 --> 3:00:13.180]  Chris in Kentucky you were saying
[3:00:13.180 --> 3:00:15.180]  Your wife is a teacher
[3:00:15.180 --> 3:00:17.180]  And we got caught off on the break, go ahead
[3:00:17.180 --> 3:00:19.180]  Yeah my wife's a kindergarten teacher
[3:00:19.180 --> 3:00:21.180]  And got
[3:00:21.180 --> 3:00:23.180]  Two kids in elementary school too
[3:00:23.180 --> 3:00:25.180]  And our Kentucky governor
[3:00:25.180 --> 3:00:27.180]  Has closed schools in our district
[3:00:27.180 --> 3:00:29.180]  Because we're quote in the red zone
[3:00:29.180 --> 3:00:31.180]  You know he's using
[3:00:31.180 --> 3:00:33.180]  All of his
[3:00:33.180 --> 3:00:35.180]  Medical
[3:00:35.180 --> 3:00:37.180]  Expertise that surrounds him
[3:00:37.180 --> 3:00:39.180]  And you know he says
[3:00:39.180 --> 3:00:41.180]  What wonderful medical experts they are
[3:00:41.180 --> 3:00:43.180]  I'm sure
[3:00:43.180 --> 3:00:45.180]  And all they're doing is following the UN Globalist orders
[3:00:45.180 --> 3:00:47.180]  Yeah I think
[3:00:47.180 --> 3:00:49.180]  Joseph Mengele was probably a respected
[3:00:49.180 --> 3:00:51.180]  Medical
[3:00:51.180 --> 3:00:53.180]  Person
[3:00:53.180 --> 3:00:55.180]  In the 30s and 40s in Germany too
[3:00:55.180 --> 3:00:57.180]  Exactly
[3:00:57.180 --> 3:00:59.180]  Exactly
[3:00:59.180 --> 3:01:01.180]  And that was the hardship
[3:01:01.180 --> 3:01:03.180]  And nobody knows from week to week
[3:01:03.180 --> 3:01:05.180]  What's fixing to happen
[3:01:05.180 --> 3:01:07.180]  And you know
[3:01:07.180 --> 3:01:09.180]  I think we've got to
[3:01:09.180 --> 3:01:11.180]  I'm praying for the president
[3:01:11.180 --> 3:01:13.180]  I wish I could be in Washington
[3:01:13.180 --> 3:01:15.180]  I'm actually on my way to Canada
[3:01:15.180 --> 3:01:17.180]  For work
[3:01:17.180 --> 3:01:19.180]  It doesn't matter brother tell folks about the event
[3:01:19.180 --> 3:01:21.180]  And we're all there in spirit
[3:01:21.180 --> 3:01:23.180]  We're gonna do this together thank you
[3:01:23.180 --> 3:01:25.180]  Parallels to Nazis are dead on here
[3:01:25.180 --> 3:01:27.180]  This violates the Nuremberg Code
[3:01:27.180 --> 3:01:29.180]  And the doctors going public about the vaccines
[3:01:29.180 --> 3:01:31.180]  Being totally deadly
[3:01:31.180 --> 3:01:33.180]  You're like well then why would they do this
[3:01:33.180 --> 3:01:35.180]  They're practicing getting us sick
[3:01:35.180 --> 3:01:37.180]  And getting away with it
[3:01:37.180 --> 3:01:39.180]  They finally got to emerge
[3:01:39.180 --> 3:01:41.180]  They finally got to make their move
[3:01:41.180 --> 3:01:43.180]  This is it
[3:01:43.180 --> 3:01:45.180]  Everything else was window dressing
[3:01:45.180 --> 3:01:47.180]  Everything else was beta testing
[3:01:47.180 --> 3:01:49.180]  This is it
[3:01:49.180 --> 3:01:51.180]  Okay let's go to Hayes in Alabama
[3:01:51.180 --> 3:01:53.180]  Thanks for holding go ahead Hayes
[3:01:53.180 --> 3:01:55.180]  Hey Alex how are you doing
[3:01:55.180 --> 3:01:57.180]  Everything was fine until I started watching you
[3:01:57.180 --> 3:01:59.180]  About at the beginning of this year
[3:01:59.180 --> 3:02:01.180]  And you kind of dragged me out of under my rock
[3:02:01.180 --> 3:02:03.180]  So
[3:02:03.180 --> 3:02:05.180]  What I was saying notice now it's here
[3:02:05.180 --> 3:02:07.180]  Oh yeah no
[3:02:07.180 --> 3:02:09.180]  That's still on the screen here when I called in
[3:02:09.180 --> 3:02:11.180]  I worked for a big
[3:02:11.180 --> 3:02:13.180]  Tech banking company right
[3:02:13.180 --> 3:02:15.180]  And I kid you
[3:02:15.180 --> 3:02:17.180]  Not I got an email this morning
[3:02:17.180 --> 3:02:19.180]  And it talks about literally
[3:02:19.180 --> 3:02:21.180]  They're helping and their clients
[3:02:21.180 --> 3:02:23.180]  Are ushering in the fourth industrial revolution
[3:02:23.180 --> 3:02:25.180]  And they have hyperlink
[3:02:25.180 --> 3:02:27.180]  I click on the hyperlink
[3:02:27.180 --> 3:02:29.180]  Where does it go? It's the World Economic Forum
[3:02:29.180 --> 3:02:31.180]  In Klaus Schwab
[3:02:31.180 --> 3:02:33.180]  I don't know what else we got to tell people
[3:02:33.180 --> 3:02:35.180]  They're coming
[3:02:35.180 --> 3:02:37.180]  Oh it's all you in Klaus Schwab Chinese
[3:02:37.180 --> 3:02:39.180]  Communists
[3:02:39.180 --> 3:02:41.180]  Remember three and a half years ago
[3:02:41.180 --> 3:02:43.180]  Trump had won and ZZ Ping
[3:02:43.180 --> 3:02:45.180]  Went there and with Klaus Schwab
[3:02:45.180 --> 3:02:47.180]  And Jean Claude Junker
[3:02:47.180 --> 3:02:49.180]  They said we will defeat America
[3:02:49.180 --> 3:02:51.180]  And then Fauci said we're going to launch a
[3:02:51.180 --> 3:02:53.180]  And so that's crazy you work for a big bank
[3:02:53.180 --> 3:02:55.180]  And you just got your marching orders, huh?
[3:02:55.180 --> 3:02:57.180]  Well yeah
[3:02:57.180 --> 3:02:59.180]  And my thing is I'm wondering if it's even
[3:02:59.180 --> 3:03:01.180]  School that I continue working here
[3:03:01.180 --> 3:03:03.180]  Because I don't support that I don't support
[3:03:03.180 --> 3:03:05.180]  An anti-human agenda
[3:03:05.180 --> 3:03:07.180]  Sorry I just can't
[3:03:07.180 --> 3:03:09.180]  Well here's the deal they're just getting you
[3:03:09.180 --> 3:03:11.180]  They're the ones causing the depression and the lockdown
[3:03:11.180 --> 3:03:13.180]  They're just conditioning you that they're in charge
[3:03:13.180 --> 3:03:15.180]  You're learning who your general is
[3:03:15.180 --> 3:03:17.180]  Well you're a patriot inside the enemy death star
[3:03:17.180 --> 3:03:19.180]  Stay there continue to get intel
[3:03:19.180 --> 3:03:21.180]  And then when they do things that are corrupt
[3:03:21.180 --> 3:03:23.180]  Or whatever blow the whistle brother
[3:03:23.180 --> 3:03:25.180]  Yeah that's what I'm going to have to do
[3:03:25.180 --> 3:03:27.180]  I pray that they see reason
[3:03:27.180 --> 3:03:29.180]  And they turn away from this
[3:03:29.180 --> 3:03:31.180]  They're not, let me tell you
[3:03:31.180 --> 3:03:33.180]  All the corporate heads are going to bow to it
[3:03:33.180 --> 3:03:35.180]  Yeah it's kind of
[3:03:35.180 --> 3:03:37.180]  Ridiculous honestly
[3:03:37.180 --> 3:03:39.180]  Well brother it's how it works
[3:03:39.180 --> 3:03:41.180]  They're making their move man
[3:03:41.180 --> 3:03:43.180]  Thank God you were already informed
[3:03:43.180 --> 3:03:45.180]  Think of your other colleagues
[3:03:45.180 --> 3:03:47.180]  They don't know what the great reset is
[3:03:47.180 --> 3:03:49.180]  What industrial is
[3:03:49.180 --> 3:03:51.180]  Which is a post industrial
[3:03:51.180 --> 3:03:53.180]  You've got to warn them now
[3:03:53.180 --> 3:03:55.180]  You'd be surprised by how many
[3:03:55.180 --> 3:03:57.180]  Sidebar conversations I've had with people
[3:03:57.180 --> 3:03:59.180]  And they start saying it's funny
[3:03:59.180 --> 3:04:01.180]  Because they'll say you know Bill Gates
[3:04:01.180 --> 3:04:03.180]  And I'm like oh you're one of us
[3:04:03.180 --> 3:04:05.180]  You know what's going on
[3:04:05.180 --> 3:04:07.180]  And I talk to them and they watch info wars
[3:04:07.180 --> 3:04:09.180]  And they know what's going on
[3:04:09.180 --> 3:04:11.180]  That's really the good news is
[3:04:11.180 --> 3:04:13.180]  We're not alone and so
[3:04:13.180 --> 3:04:15.180]  They're the ones that are in trouble
[3:04:15.180 --> 3:04:17.180]  And they're making their move
[3:04:17.180 --> 3:04:19.180]  God bless you sir I appreciate your call
[3:04:19.180 --> 3:04:21.180]  Paul back anytime
[3:04:21.180 --> 3:04:23.180]  Sorry I'll put your names here today
[3:04:23.180 --> 3:04:25.180]  My eyes are going out
[3:04:25.180 --> 3:04:27.180]  Let's talk to Chris in Ohio
[3:04:27.180 --> 3:04:29.180]  Chris go ahead
[3:04:29.180 --> 3:04:31.180]  Hey Alex how's it going
[3:04:31.180 --> 3:04:33.180]  Well you just heard that caller
[3:04:33.180 --> 3:04:35.180]  Works at a big bank and he just got told
[3:04:35.180 --> 3:04:37.180]  Klaus Schwab's is his guru
[3:04:37.180 --> 3:04:39.180]  Oh yeah well
[3:04:39.180 --> 3:04:41.180]  I just had a couple of questions here
[3:04:41.180 --> 3:04:43.180]  Because I'm sorry harking it back
[3:04:43.180 --> 3:04:45.180]  You know ducking debates with Jordan Holmes
[3:04:45.180 --> 3:04:47.180]  And the second one you know would be
[3:04:47.180 --> 3:04:49.180]  You said you were going to cut
[3:04:49.180 --> 3:04:51.180]  A microchip out of a dude
[3:04:51.180 --> 3:04:53.180]  That homeless guy a long while ago
[3:04:53.180 --> 3:04:55.180]  And I never saw that happen
[3:04:55.180 --> 3:04:57.180]  I was hoping to house the proof
[3:04:57.180 --> 3:04:59.180]  That I could show people
[3:04:59.180 --> 3:05:01.180]  And I was telling people for a while
[3:05:01.180 --> 3:05:03.180]  Like weeks to the time that you were going to do that
[3:05:03.180 --> 3:05:05.180]  Well listen that's completely reasonable Chris
[3:05:05.180 --> 3:05:07.180]  It's all over the news that MIT's
[3:05:07.180 --> 3:05:09.180]  Developed digital liquid chips
[3:05:09.180 --> 3:05:11.180]  With the vaccines
[3:05:11.180 --> 3:05:13.180]  Newsweek
[3:05:13.180 --> 3:05:15.180]  Time magazine USA Today
[3:05:15.180 --> 3:05:17.180]  You will soon all have a chip
[3:05:17.180 --> 3:05:19.180]  World governments here
[3:05:19.180 --> 3:05:21.180]  We got the documents that were real
[3:05:21.180 --> 3:05:23.180]  From the UN group
[3:05:23.180 --> 3:05:25.180]  Tracking homeless and they're planned to chip
[3:05:25.180 --> 3:05:27.180]  They have chipped in
[3:05:27.180 --> 3:05:29.180]  Some Latin American countries
[3:05:29.180 --> 3:05:31.180]  And then we had the homeless guy
[3:05:31.180 --> 3:05:33.180]  Who gave us the paperwork ready to talk
[3:05:33.180 --> 3:05:35.180]  And he got paranoid and wouldn't do the interview
[3:05:35.180 --> 3:05:37.180]  So I mean are you debating
[3:05:37.180 --> 3:05:39.180]  That there is a movement
[3:05:39.180 --> 3:05:41.180]  To chip first the most disadvantaged people
[3:05:41.180 --> 3:05:43.180]  No I was saying
[3:05:43.180 --> 3:05:45.180]  You're the one that said that
[3:05:45.180 --> 3:05:47.180]  Oh listen brother 100%
[3:05:47.180 --> 3:05:49.180]  100% sometimes
[3:05:49.180 --> 3:05:51.180]  We got to fish right up to the boat
[3:05:51.180 --> 3:05:53.180]  And then the line snaps
[3:05:53.180 --> 3:05:55.180]  So that was just somebody we didn't get the interview with
[3:05:55.180 --> 3:05:57.180]  If they're doing it to all the homeless people
[3:05:57.180 --> 3:05:59.180]  Shouldn't you be able to find at least one
[3:05:59.180 --> 3:06:01.180]  That will let you pay them to take out the microchip
[3:06:01.180 --> 3:06:03.180]  Well I didn't say it to all of them
[3:06:03.180 --> 3:06:05.180]  They're starting a pilot program was what it was
[3:06:05.180 --> 3:06:07.180]  And again I appreciate your call man
[3:06:07.180 --> 3:06:09.180]  Listen Chris I welcome you to go out
[3:06:09.180 --> 3:06:11.180]  And find it yourself and show it to people
[3:06:11.180 --> 3:06:13.180]  Okay I'm trying as hard
[3:06:13.180 --> 3:06:15.180]  As I can brother and I'm just human
[3:06:15.180 --> 3:06:17.180]  But pray for me I'll be stronger
[3:06:17.180 --> 3:06:19.180]  Alright but seriously pray for me
[3:06:19.180 --> 3:06:21.180]  That I'll have your strength
[3:06:21.180 --> 3:06:23.180]  And I will really try to do a better job
[3:06:23.180 --> 3:06:25.180]  I don't know about Rand Paul and what you said about him
[3:06:25.180 --> 3:06:27.180]  I'm sure Biden will deal with him
[3:06:27.180 --> 3:06:29.180]  Don't worry get rid of that damn Rand Paul
[3:06:29.180 --> 3:06:31.180]  Too bad Black Lives Matter didn't kill him right
[3:06:31.180 --> 3:06:33.180]  Alright thank you sir
[3:06:33.180 --> 3:06:35.180]  Isaac in Minnesota you're on the air
[3:06:35.180 --> 3:06:37.180]  Hey
[3:06:37.180 --> 3:06:39.180]  I just wanted to call
[3:06:39.180 --> 3:06:41.180]  And talk to you about the
[3:06:41.180 --> 3:06:43.180]  Thing with YouTube that's going on
[3:06:43.180 --> 3:06:45.180]  They're trying to
[3:06:45.180 --> 3:06:47.180]  Stop you from talking
[3:06:47.180 --> 3:06:49.180]  About it just today
[3:06:49.180 --> 3:06:51.180]  Posted something on their blog
[3:06:51.180 --> 3:06:53.180]  That says they're going to be removing
[3:06:53.180 --> 3:06:55.180]  All
[3:06:55.180 --> 3:06:57.180]  Election
[3:06:57.180 --> 3:06:59.180]  Election videos that
[3:06:59.180 --> 3:07:01.180]  Yeah well they've been doing it
[3:07:01.180 --> 3:07:03.180]  I mean they've been doing it but the last
[3:07:03.180 --> 3:07:05.180]  Honorable say show me the proof
[3:07:05.180 --> 3:07:07.180]  I mean they've announced
[3:07:07.180 --> 3:07:09.180]  That you're not going to question this election
[3:07:09.180 --> 3:07:11.180]  Which is again
[3:07:11.180 --> 3:07:13.180]  Soviet level it's just
[3:07:13.180 --> 3:07:15.180]  We're now here it's a total nightmare
[3:07:15.180 --> 3:07:17.180]  And I absolutely agree with you it's horrible
[3:07:17.180 --> 3:07:19.180]  Yeah
[3:07:19.180 --> 3:07:21.180]  But like I'm looking at their blog right now
[3:07:21.180 --> 3:07:23.180]  And they're just blatantly
[3:07:23.180 --> 3:07:25.180]  Saying that oh you can't question this
[3:07:25.180 --> 3:07:27.180]  And for four years they
[3:07:27.180 --> 3:07:29.180]  Were allowed to question blatantly false claims
[3:07:29.180 --> 3:07:31.180]  With Russia and Russia
[3:07:31.180 --> 3:07:33.180]  And all this other crap
[3:07:33.180 --> 3:07:35.180]  Dude they said on Monday
[3:07:35.180 --> 3:07:37.180]  We're going to suppress
[3:07:37.180 --> 3:07:39.180]  White males because
[3:07:39.180 --> 3:07:41.180]  They're bad I'm a white male
[3:07:41.180 --> 3:07:43.180]  I don't like it because I'm a human
[3:07:43.180 --> 3:07:44.180]  But obviously it's a play
[3:07:44.180 --> 3:07:45.180]  It's off against each other
[3:07:45.180 --> 3:07:47.180]  Imagine if they said we're going to suppress
[3:07:47.180 --> 3:07:49.180]  Black males because they're bad well that's what
[3:07:49.180 --> 3:07:51.180]  Hillary said these are sick
[3:07:51.180 --> 3:07:53.180]  People
[3:07:53.180 --> 3:07:55.180]  Yeah and they're just doing it
[3:07:55.180 --> 3:07:57.180]  Right in front of us because they know that
[3:07:57.180 --> 3:07:59.180]  People won't do anything
[3:07:59.180 --> 3:08:01.180]  They'll get mad online and then they won't do anything
[3:08:01.180 --> 3:08:03.180]  Well they'll submit most people actually
[3:08:03.180 --> 3:08:05.180]  Submit thanks Isaac sorry out of time
[3:08:05.180 --> 3:08:07.180]  Last caller Bob in New York ahead of
[3:08:07.180 --> 3:08:09.180]  Wrapping for it take it over go ahead Bob
[3:08:09.180 --> 3:08:11.180]  Hey Alex
[3:08:11.180 --> 3:08:13.180]  Love you man
[3:08:13.180 --> 3:08:15.180]  Love you thank you pray for your family
[3:08:15.180 --> 3:08:17.180]  And uh
[3:08:17.180 --> 3:08:19.180]  I need those prayers more than anything brother because
[3:08:19.180 --> 3:08:21.180]  My spirit's strong my body's not that strong
[3:08:21.180 --> 3:08:23.180]  Yeah well you know it man you
[3:08:23.180 --> 3:08:25.180]  You've heard from me in the past but
[3:08:25.180 --> 3:08:27.180]  You always blow my mind especially
[3:08:27.180 --> 3:08:29.180]  Now that you're saying Chinese troops
[3:08:29.180 --> 3:08:31.180]  Are in North America
[3:08:31.180 --> 3:08:33.180]  Uh
[3:08:33.180 --> 3:08:35.180]  It's crazy it's real
[3:08:35.180 --> 3:08:37.180]  I mean it's absolutely real brother
[3:08:37.180 --> 3:08:39.180]  It's a coup it's a coup and you know
[3:08:39.180 --> 3:08:41.180]  That I know it's a coup I mean I know
[3:08:41.180 --> 3:08:43.180]  What you know I mean I got into you
[3:08:43.180 --> 3:08:45.180]  Back when we were still talking about the
[3:08:45.180 --> 3:08:47.180]  The trans Texas corridor
[3:08:47.180 --> 3:08:49.180]  And you know building that
[3:08:49.180 --> 3:08:51.180]  From the west coast of Mexico up to Kansas City
[3:08:51.180 --> 3:08:53.180]  All owned by Chinese
[3:08:53.180 --> 3:08:55.180]  Marshall law then was
[3:08:55.180 --> 3:08:57.180]  Uh we were
[3:08:57.180 --> 3:08:59.180]  A little fearful of it because
[3:08:59.180 --> 3:09:01.180]  Bush was in charge and neocons were in charge
[3:09:01.180 --> 3:09:03.180]  You didn't know what was going to happen
[3:09:03.180 --> 3:09:05.180]  With Chinese troops working for them or
[3:09:05.180 --> 3:09:07.180]  See that's the thing once you get hit with a real
[3:09:07.180 --> 3:09:09.180]  Attack it's so fast you can't even
[3:09:09.180 --> 3:09:11.180]  And now this is what it's like brother
[3:09:11.180 --> 3:09:13.180]  Yeah this is what it's like so
[3:09:13.180 --> 3:09:15.180]  So my point is uh
[3:09:15.180 --> 3:09:17.180]  If we're going to maritime law you know even
[3:09:17.180 --> 3:09:19.180]  Um going all the way back to everyone
[3:09:19.180 --> 3:09:21.180]  Is their own island and we can all defend
[3:09:21.180 --> 3:09:23.180]  Ourselves so why is Trump letting it
[3:09:23.180 --> 3:09:25.180]  This far people don't you know I think
[3:09:25.180 --> 3:09:27.180]  I'm going to criticize Trump tomorrow and not
[3:09:27.180 --> 3:09:29.180]  Just to earn brownie points of people but
[3:09:29.180 --> 3:09:31.180]  He needs to be criticized on some points I agree
[3:09:31.180 --> 3:09:33.180]  Hey John Rapport's coming up thank you Bob
[3:09:33.180 --> 3:09:35.180]  Then Owen Shroyer's going to be on with the
[3:09:35.180 --> 3:09:37.180]  Chinese troop thing bigger than Dallas
[3:09:37.180 --> 3:09:39.180]  And let's get Ezra Levant on with him too
[3:09:39.180 --> 3:09:41.180]  And Levant's on that broke it with us tomorrow
[3:09:43.180 --> 3:09:45.180]  The globalists are taking control
[3:09:45.180 --> 3:09:47.180]  Of the entire human genome
[3:09:47.180 --> 3:09:49.180]  They are forcing mutations
[3:09:49.180 --> 3:09:51.180]  This is forced evolution
[3:09:51.180 --> 3:09:53.180]  Or de-evolution
[3:09:53.180 --> 3:09:55.180]  When you look at all the major research
[3:09:55.180 --> 3:09:57.180]  All the major programs they're carrying out
[3:09:57.180 --> 3:09:59.180]  They are not to produce people that are smarter
[3:09:59.180 --> 3:10:01.180]  Or folks that live longer or more moral
[3:10:01.180 --> 3:10:03.180]  No it's turning humanity
[3:10:03.180 --> 3:10:05.180]  Into a commodity
[3:10:05.180 --> 3:10:07.180]  Now we see some propaganda like communist China
[3:10:07.180 --> 3:10:09.180]  Bragging hey we've done
[3:10:09.180 --> 3:10:11.180]  mRNA vaccines to make our soldiers
[3:10:11.180 --> 3:10:13.180]  Superman that's a way to make it sexy
[3:10:13.180 --> 3:10:15.180]  That hey we're experimenting on our troops
[3:10:15.180 --> 3:10:17.180]  We'll say things that happened to our troops
[3:10:17.180 --> 3:10:19.180]  And thousands and thousands
[3:10:19.180 --> 3:10:21.180]  Of died each time they tried
[3:10:21.180 --> 3:10:23.180]  A new experimental vaccine
[3:10:23.180 --> 3:10:25.180]  And I've talked to high level folks inside the federal government
[3:10:25.180 --> 3:10:27.180]  And the state of Texas health department
[3:10:27.180 --> 3:10:29.180]  They say Alex we know it hurts a lot of people
[3:10:29.180 --> 3:10:31.180]  That's for a greater good
[3:10:31.180 --> 3:10:33.180]  But that's not even true
[3:10:33.180 --> 3:10:35.180]  And it violates the Geneva Convention
[3:10:35.180 --> 3:10:37.180]  The Nuremberg Code, federal state law
[3:10:37.180 --> 3:10:39.180]  This is violence being carried out against us
[3:10:39.180 --> 3:10:41.180]  And we have a right to resist it
[3:10:41.180 --> 3:10:43.180]  With any means necessary
[3:10:43.180 --> 3:10:45.180]  If you think 2020 has been an insane
[3:10:45.180 --> 3:10:47.180]  And dangerous year
[3:10:47.180 --> 3:10:49.180]  Just wait until you see the year 2021
[3:10:49.180 --> 3:10:51.180]  I'm Alex Jones
[3:10:51.180 --> 3:10:53.180]  I started in full wars
[3:10:53.180 --> 3:10:55.180]  But I couldn't have done any of this without you
[3:10:55.180 --> 3:10:57.180]  And now in full wars is more important than ever
[3:10:57.180 --> 3:10:59.180]  Because the general population
[3:10:59.180 --> 3:11:01.180]  Of the planet is weighing up the fact that
[3:11:01.180 --> 3:11:03.180]  We've done our research and we've been dead on
[3:11:03.180 --> 3:11:05.180]  That's why it's so important for those of you out there
[3:11:05.180 --> 3:11:07.180]  That have supported the broadcast
[3:11:07.180 --> 3:11:09.180]  And the websites and the films
[3:11:09.180 --> 3:11:11.180]  And all the rest of the information we put out
[3:11:11.180 --> 3:11:13.180]  To realize how important your work has been
[3:11:13.180 --> 3:11:15.180]  And to redouble your efforts
[3:11:15.180 --> 3:11:17.180]  Also, as Christmas is almost here
[3:11:17.180 --> 3:11:19.180]  Don't wait, do your shopping

[3:11:39.180 --> 3:11:41.180]  And again, thank you all for your support
[3:11:41.180 --> 3:11:45.180]  Merry Christmas, God Bless
[3:12:11.180 --> 3:12:13.180]  And now, your host
[3:12:13.180 --> 3:12:15.180]  John Rappaport
[3:12:17.180 --> 3:12:19.180]  Here we go, folks, another weekly chat
[3:12:19.180 --> 3:12:21.180]  On
[3:12:21.180 --> 3:12:23.180]  Vital issues of the day
[3:12:25.180 --> 3:12:27.180]  May get into something about Attorney General
[3:12:27.180 --> 3:12:29.180]  Barr later on
[3:12:29.180 --> 3:12:31.180]  Because I'll probably lose it
[3:12:31.180 --> 3:12:33.180]  Then, rather than now
[3:12:35.180 --> 3:12:37.180]  Gotta keep my head together here for a while
[3:12:37.180 --> 3:12:39.180]  Strategy
[3:12:39.180 --> 3:12:41.180]  COVID
[3:12:43.180 --> 3:12:45.180]  Breakthrough
[3:12:47.180 --> 3:12:49.180]  So I want to hammer one more time
[3:12:49.180 --> 3:12:51.180]  And this will not be the last time
[3:12:53.180 --> 3:12:55.180]  On the test
[3:12:55.180 --> 3:12:57.180]  The PCR test
[3:12:59.180 --> 3:13:01.180]  But we have new news about it
[3:13:01.180 --> 3:13:05.180]  All the case numbers are based on the test
[3:13:07.180 --> 3:13:09.180]  So when the media report
[3:13:09.180 --> 3:13:11.180]  Governors report
[3:13:11.180 --> 3:13:13.180]  Public health officials report
[3:13:13.180 --> 3:13:15.180]  Oh, rising case numbers
[3:13:15.180 --> 3:13:17.180]  And it's terrible
[3:13:17.180 --> 3:13:19.180]  And therefore
[3:13:19.180 --> 3:13:21.180]  We have to do lockdowns
[3:13:23.180 --> 3:13:25.180]  It's all based on the case numbers
[3:13:27.180 --> 3:13:29.180]  And the case numbers are derived
[3:13:29.180 --> 3:13:31.180]  From the test
[3:13:31.180 --> 3:13:33.180]  Understand that
[3:13:33.180 --> 3:13:35.180]  Before anything else
[3:13:35.180 --> 3:13:37.180]  That's the chain
[3:13:37.180 --> 3:13:39.180]  The test, the case numbers
[3:13:39.180 --> 3:13:41.180]  Are locked down
[3:13:43.180 --> 3:13:45.180]  It's all fraud all the way
[3:13:47.180 --> 3:13:49.180]  As I've demonstrated and described
[3:13:49.180 --> 3:13:51.180]  Here on the show
[3:13:51.180 --> 3:13:53.180]  And in many articles with no more fake news
[3:13:53.180 --> 3:13:55.180]  The test is fraudulent
[3:13:55.180 --> 3:13:57.180]  For a variety
[3:13:57.180 --> 3:13:59.180]  Of reasons
[3:13:59.180 --> 3:14:01.180]  A variety of reasons
[3:14:01.180 --> 3:14:03.180]  It's useless, it's worthless
[3:14:03.180 --> 3:14:05.180]  And even more importantly
[3:14:05.180 --> 3:14:07.180]  It's deceptive
[3:14:07.180 --> 3:14:09.180]  Because it creates mountains
[3:14:09.180 --> 3:14:11.180]  Of what are called false positives
[3:14:11.180 --> 3:14:13.180]  Which means
[3:14:13.180 --> 3:14:15.180]  That people who have
[3:14:15.180 --> 3:14:17.180]  No condition whatsoever
[3:14:17.180 --> 3:14:19.180]  That could be
[3:14:19.180 --> 3:14:21.180]  Remotely connected to
[3:14:21.180 --> 3:14:23.180]  Something
[3:14:23.180 --> 3:14:25.180]  Hypothetically called COVID-19
[3:14:25.180 --> 3:14:27.180]  Are being
[3:14:27.180 --> 3:14:29.180]  Diagnosed as infected
[3:14:29.180 --> 3:14:31.180]  With the coronavirus
[3:14:31.180 --> 3:14:33.180]  And they are counted as cases
[3:14:33.180 --> 3:14:35.180]  Based on the test
[3:14:37.180 --> 3:14:39.180]  Okay, so we've established that
[3:14:43.180 --> 3:14:45.180]  Second up
[3:14:45.180 --> 3:14:47.180]  One of the ways
[3:14:47.180 --> 3:14:49.180]  Most important ways that the test is deceptive
[3:14:51.180 --> 3:14:53.180]  Is
[3:14:53.180 --> 3:14:55.180]  How many cycles
[3:14:55.180 --> 3:14:57.180]  Are used
[3:14:57.180 --> 3:14:59.180]  In doing the test
[3:14:59.180 --> 3:15:01.180]  What is a cycle?
[3:15:03.180 --> 3:15:05.180]  A cycle is an amplification
[3:15:05.180 --> 3:15:07.180]  Or a blow up
[3:15:07.180 --> 3:15:09.180]  Of, let's call it
[3:15:09.180 --> 3:15:11.180]  The original
[3:15:11.180 --> 3:15:13.180]  Sample taken
[3:15:13.180 --> 3:15:15.180]  From the patient
[3:15:15.180 --> 3:15:17.180]  It's a little more complex than that
[3:15:17.180 --> 3:15:19.180]  But we'll call it that
[3:15:19.180 --> 3:15:21.180]  So you start off with something
[3:15:21.180 --> 3:15:23.180]  Very, very tiny
[3:15:23.180 --> 3:15:25.180]  As a result of a swab
[3:15:25.180 --> 3:15:27.180]  Of a patient
[3:15:27.180 --> 3:15:29.180]  And the PCR test
[3:15:29.180 --> 3:15:31.180]  As if it's looking at a very tiny
[3:15:31.180 --> 3:15:33.180]  Snapshot
[3:15:33.180 --> 3:15:35.180]  Blows it up
[3:15:35.180 --> 3:15:37.180]  In size
[3:15:37.180 --> 3:15:39.180]  In a series of quantum
[3:15:39.180 --> 3:15:41.180]  Leaps
[3:15:41.180 --> 3:15:43.180]  Of extreme magnification
[3:15:43.180 --> 3:15:45.180]  And each one of those
[3:15:45.180 --> 3:15:47.180]  Quantum leaps
[3:15:47.180 --> 3:15:49.180]  Is called a cycle
[3:15:49.180 --> 3:15:51.180]  So
[3:15:51.180 --> 3:15:53.180]  How many cycles should the test
[3:15:53.180 --> 3:15:55.180]  Be run at?
[3:15:55.180 --> 3:15:57.180]  Well
[3:15:57.180 --> 3:15:59.180]  Now we get down to something very
[3:15:59.180 --> 3:16:01.180]  Interesting
[3:16:01.180 --> 3:16:03.180]  As I've described
[3:16:05.180 --> 3:16:07.180]  Linked to it on my site
[3:16:07.180 --> 3:16:09.180]  And talked about it here
[3:16:09.180 --> 3:16:11.180]  We have Anthony Fauci
[3:16:11.180 --> 3:16:13.180]  On video
[3:16:15.180 --> 3:16:17.180]  Recently
[3:16:17.180 --> 3:16:19.180]  Talking about how
[3:16:19.180 --> 3:16:21.180]  35 cycles
[3:16:21.180 --> 3:16:23.180]  Or more
[3:16:23.180 --> 3:16:25.180]  Of the test
[3:16:25.180 --> 3:16:27.180]  If it's run at 35 or more
[3:16:27.180 --> 3:16:29.180]  Cycles it's totally useless
[3:16:29.180 --> 3:16:31.180]  Nothing about the results
[3:16:31.180 --> 3:16:33.180]  Can be interpreted
[3:16:33.180 --> 3:16:35.180]  In any
[3:16:35.180 --> 3:16:37.180]  Rational cognizant way
[3:16:41.180 --> 3:16:43.180]  The reasons are various
[3:16:43.180 --> 3:16:45.180]  And so on
[3:16:45.180 --> 3:16:47.180]  You're blowing up something
[3:16:47.180 --> 3:16:49.180]  So big now
[3:16:49.180 --> 3:16:51.180]  That it's catching things
[3:16:51.180 --> 3:16:53.180]  That are completely irrelevant
[3:16:53.180 --> 3:16:55.180]  Just the way
[3:16:55.180 --> 3:16:57.180]  If you blew up a snapshot
[3:16:57.180 --> 3:16:59.180]  Let's say
[3:16:59.180 --> 3:17:01.180]  100 million times
[3:17:01.180 --> 3:17:03.180]  A photograph snapshot
[3:17:03.180 --> 3:17:05.180]  You would be seeing
[3:17:05.180 --> 3:17:07.180]  Things
[3:17:07.180 --> 3:17:09.180]  That you could interpret
[3:17:09.180 --> 3:17:11.180]  Any way you wanted to
[3:17:11.180 --> 3:17:13.180]  That are completely irrelevant
[3:17:13.180 --> 3:17:15.180]  And so on
[3:17:17.180 --> 3:17:19.180]  What Fauci failed
[3:17:19.180 --> 3:17:21.180]  To mention
[3:17:21.180 --> 3:17:23.180]  In this
[3:17:23.180 --> 3:17:25.180]  Publicly available video
[3:17:25.180 --> 3:17:27.180]  Is that
[3:17:27.180 --> 3:17:29.180]  The FDA
[3:17:29.180 --> 3:17:31.180]  Which certifies
[3:17:31.180 --> 3:17:33.180]  All diagnostic tests
[3:17:33.180 --> 3:17:35.180]  As being approved
[3:17:35.180 --> 3:17:37.180]  For public use
[3:17:37.180 --> 3:17:39.180]  And the CDC
[3:17:39.180 --> 3:17:41.180]  Their guidelines
[3:17:41.180 --> 3:17:43.180]  Recommending
[3:17:43.180 --> 3:17:45.180]  Doing the test
[3:17:45.180 --> 3:17:47.180]  Up to 40 cycles
[3:17:47.180 --> 3:17:49.180]  Way above
[3:17:49.180 --> 3:17:51.180]  The 35
[3:17:51.180 --> 3:17:53.180]  Cycle limit
[3:17:55.180 --> 3:17:57.180]  Which means that you're going to get labs
[3:17:57.180 --> 3:17:59.180]  All over the US
[3:17:59.180 --> 3:18:01.180]  And probably the world
[3:18:01.180 --> 3:18:03.180]  That are running this test
[3:18:03.180 --> 3:18:05.180]  At too many cycles
[3:18:05.180 --> 3:18:07.180]  Far too many cycles
[3:18:07.180 --> 3:18:09.180]  Thus creating
[3:18:09.180 --> 3:18:11.180]  Millions and millions
[3:18:11.180 --> 3:18:13.180]  And millions
[3:18:13.180 --> 3:18:15.180]  Of false positive results
[3:18:15.180 --> 3:18:17.180]  Meaning results
[3:18:17.180 --> 3:18:19.180]  That apparently
[3:18:19.180 --> 3:18:21.180]  Indicate
[3:18:21.180 --> 3:18:23.180]  That these people
[3:18:23.180 --> 3:18:25.180]  These patients are
[3:18:25.180 --> 3:18:27.180]  Infected with the virus
[3:18:27.180 --> 3:18:29.180]  But that's not true
[3:18:29.180 --> 3:18:31.180]  That's completely false
[3:18:31.180 --> 3:18:33.180]  But all of these people
[3:18:33.180 --> 3:18:35.180]  Not only will be
[3:18:35.180 --> 3:18:37.180]  Now
[3:18:37.180 --> 3:18:39.180]  Treated etc etc
[3:18:39.180 --> 3:18:41.180]  Their lives
[3:18:41.180 --> 3:18:43.180]  Disturbed in many different ways
[3:18:43.180 --> 3:18:45.180]  But each one of these people
[3:18:45.180 --> 3:18:47.180]  Becomes a case
[3:18:47.180 --> 3:18:49.180]  Number
[3:18:49.180 --> 3:18:51.180]  A COVID case number
[3:18:53.180 --> 3:18:55.180]  Without any rational reason
[3:18:55.180 --> 3:18:57.180]  It's a false positive
[3:18:59.180 --> 3:19:01.180]  So when you have all of these labs
[3:19:01.180 --> 3:19:03.180]  Following
[3:19:03.180 --> 3:19:07.180]  CPA and CDC guidelines
[3:19:07.180 --> 3:19:09.180]  Scientifically
[3:19:09.180 --> 3:19:11.180]  Incorrect and worthless guidelines
[3:19:11.180 --> 3:19:13.180]  What you get
[3:19:13.180 --> 3:19:15.180]  Is millions of false
[3:19:15.180 --> 3:19:17.180]  Positives
[3:19:17.180 --> 3:19:19.180]  Therefore the number of cases
[3:19:19.180 --> 3:19:21.180]  That are reported of COVID
[3:19:21.180 --> 3:19:23.180]  Escalate everywhere
[3:19:23.180 --> 3:19:25.180]  And governors then say
[3:19:25.180 --> 3:19:27.180]  Well, you see what's happening
[3:19:27.180 --> 3:19:29.180]  Our only course of action
[3:19:29.180 --> 3:19:31.180]  Is to achieve
[3:19:31.180 --> 3:19:33.180]  New lockdowns
[3:19:33.180 --> 3:19:35.180]  And therefore
[3:19:35.180 --> 3:19:37.180]  That's what I'm ordering
[3:19:37.180 --> 3:19:39.180]  And these lockdowns
[3:19:39.180 --> 3:19:41.180]  Are
[3:19:41.180 --> 3:19:43.180]  Absolutely
[3:19:43.180 --> 3:19:45.180]  In-house arrests
[3:19:45.180 --> 3:19:47.180]  Unconstitutional
[3:19:47.180 --> 3:19:49.180]  Etc etc
[3:19:49.180 --> 3:19:51.180]  Destroying lives, livelihoods
[3:19:51.180 --> 3:19:53.180]  Reaching extensive economic
[3:19:53.180 --> 3:19:55.180]  Damage
[3:19:55.180 --> 3:19:57.180]  All over the US and the world
[3:19:57.180 --> 3:19:59.180]  Based on
[3:19:59.180 --> 3:20:01.180]  The fraudulent use
[3:20:01.180 --> 3:20:03.180]  Of this PCR test
[3:20:05.180 --> 3:20:07.180]  And as we head
[3:20:07.180 --> 3:20:09.180]  Into the first break here
[3:20:09.180 --> 3:20:11.180]  I do want to mention
[3:20:11.180 --> 3:20:13.180]  That the extent
[3:20:13.180 --> 3:20:15.180]  Of the economic damage
[3:20:15.180 --> 3:20:17.180]  And the destruction
[3:20:17.180 --> 3:20:19.180]  What it looks like
[3:20:19.180 --> 3:20:21.180]  What it feels like
[3:20:21.180 --> 3:20:23.180]  What it is like
[3:20:23.180 --> 3:20:25.180]  Has been concealed
[3:20:25.180 --> 3:20:27.180]  In the American public
[3:20:27.180 --> 3:20:29.180]  And the world public
[3:20:29.180 --> 3:20:31.180]  By mainstream media
[3:20:33.180 --> 3:20:35.180]  Who are under orders
[3:20:35.180 --> 3:20:37.180]  Not to record it extensively
[3:20:37.180 --> 3:20:39.180]  In living color
[3:20:39.180 --> 3:20:41.180]  Stay tuned
[3:20:41.180 --> 3:20:57.180]  To see the next one
[3:20:57.180 --> 3:20:59.180]  It's basically scaring the hell out of people
[3:20:59.180 --> 3:21:01.180]  Until you submit to them
[3:21:01.180 --> 3:21:03.180]  That's exactly what all this overblown
[3:21:03.180 --> 3:21:05.180]  COVID-19 garbage is
[3:21:05.180 --> 3:21:07.180]  You see the headlines
[3:21:07.180 --> 3:21:09.180]  From CNN, ABC News
[3:21:09.180 --> 3:21:15.580]  imagine they told us that two and a half million people would be dead just eight months ago within
[3:21:15.580 --> 3:21:22.060]  three months okay it's a quarter million if you count all of the people that died of other things
[3:21:22.060 --> 3:21:27.500]  we're talking 96 that comorbidity these are real numbers these are real facts this is the chicken
[3:21:27.500 --> 3:21:32.140]  little event we all run our houses never come out they're taught we're not essential all the big
[3:21:32.140 --> 3:21:38.860]  box stores in amazon take over the planet rebuke it stand up against it this is slavery it is not
[3:21:38.860 --> 3:21:44.860]  something you could put up with and survive most of the world submitted to the unconstitutional
[3:21:44.860 --> 3:21:49.820]  criminal lockdowns directed by the communist chinese and the united nations and now because
[3:21:49.820 --> 3:21:55.980]  the slaves have proven themselves to be subservient the worst australian models of complete lockdowns
[3:21:55.980 --> 3:22:00.940]  you can't even leave your house for months and months are being announced and in germany the
[3:22:00.940 --> 3:22:06.220]  police are using giant armored tanks with water cannons to blast men women and children that
[3:22:06.220 --> 3:22:10.860]  protest the fact that merkel the dictator has put them under her control that's right she's been
[3:22:10.860 --> 3:22:16.700]  ringing elections for years and years and the same thing is coming here to the united states this is
[3:22:16.700 --> 3:22:22.460]  world government in philadelphia they've announced four people or more seen together will be arrested
[3:22:22.460 --> 3:22:26.940]  they're announcing that christmas is canceled this is what the communist takeover looks like
[3:22:26.940 --> 3:22:32.700]  to bankrupt you to take rid of all your due process and absolutely transform the world
[3:22:32.700 --> 3:22:38.540]  into a prison planet how long have we warned you about this but you can fight back america
[3:22:38.540 --> 3:22:48.620]  is the last bastion stop submitting
[3:22:53.180 --> 3:22:59.740]  now it's easier than ever to have band.video on your iphone simply go to band.video with your
[3:22:59.740 --> 3:23:05.260]  safari browser then you click the share button at the bottom of the screen when the menu comes up
[3:23:05.260 --> 3:23:11.500]  you simply click add to home screen it will then ask you to name the app i suggest band.video
[3:23:12.060 --> 3:23:16.940]  you will now have band.video app on your home screen despite the fact that tim cook tried to
[3:23:16.940 --> 3:23:21.260]  stop it the globalists think you're lazy but by taking a little bit of action you can override
[3:23:21.260 --> 3:23:26.940]  them have the app and then tell others about it so they can get the app so it's up to you whether
[3:23:26.940 --> 3:23:31.660]  you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below on your email on facebook on
[3:23:31.660 --> 3:23:42.860]  twitter on youtube however you want be sure and share band.video
[3:23:42.860 --> 3:23:58.780]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:23:58.780 --> 3:24:11.900]  news analysis reports it's the alex jones show and now your host john rapaport
[3:24:14.860 --> 3:24:15.980]  okay part two
[3:24:15.980 --> 3:24:28.060]  so in the last segment i described how the test PCR test is at the bottom of this enormous fraud
[3:24:29.020 --> 3:24:35.980]  generating millions of supposed cases of COVID-19 nothing could be further from the truth
[3:24:35.980 --> 3:24:46.380]  and these cases rising case numbers that's the rationale used by political officials governors
[3:24:46.380 --> 3:24:55.180]  and so on to institute in-house arrests lockdowns destruction of the economy and human life
[3:24:57.100 --> 3:25:05.180]  and that the media are instructed not to explore the extent of the economic wreckage
[3:25:05.180 --> 3:25:10.220]  or the human wreckage up close and personal and really show it to you
[3:25:11.580 --> 3:25:17.580]  and pound it into you as to what's really happened to this country and other countries
[3:25:19.260 --> 3:25:26.460]  but instead to show little cute public service announcements and so on and so forth that you
[3:25:26.460 --> 3:25:34.940]  see on television as kind of a sop oh yes we're fine we'll be fine
[3:25:38.940 --> 3:25:47.900]  they're under instructions not to show this to you for example anybody with a camera
[3:25:48.780 --> 3:25:54.300]  could walk down the streets of new york city once the greatest city in the world
[3:25:54.300 --> 3:26:05.900]  and see how desolate it has become over the last nine months the boarded up stores and businesses
[3:26:06.940 --> 3:26:15.020]  the lack of people on the streets the people who are there walking along like zombies wearing
[3:26:15.020 --> 3:26:25.020]  masks just that alone given enough time and coverage on the media would begin to make
[3:26:25.020 --> 3:26:31.900]  things sink into people as to the degree of horrendous economic destruction and then
[3:26:31.900 --> 3:26:37.580]  interviews with small business owners whose lives have been completely destroyed
[3:26:37.580 --> 3:26:47.100]  and then people would start to see what these lockdowns are really all about
[3:26:48.460 --> 3:26:55.100]  and how in fact that is the primary operation here that's being carried out
[3:26:55.100 --> 3:27:01.900]  on the global population the virus the test all of that is just the cover story
[3:27:01.900 --> 3:27:13.420]  okay now perhaps you've noticed that in the last couple of months in particular
[3:27:14.460 --> 3:27:22.860]  there has been growing in what's ridiculously called the alternative media more and more
[3:27:22.860 --> 3:27:35.980]  testimony proof evidence awareness that this PCR test is in fact a fraud essays open letters
[3:27:36.940 --> 3:27:47.500]  scientists testifying lawyers putting together cases this is serious business and the awareness
[3:27:47.500 --> 3:27:58.780]  and the action are both expanding the attack on the PCR test is growing and the bit of
[3:27:58.780 --> 3:28:07.580]  breaking news in the last several days on this front is much more significant than most people
[3:28:07.580 --> 3:28:18.460]  realize because the state of florida under governor de santis issued by his public health
[3:28:18.460 --> 3:28:28.140]  department the state public health department is now requiring all labs in the state to report
[3:28:28.140 --> 3:28:36.220]  for each test they do how many cycles they ran the test at
[3:28:40.460 --> 3:28:47.580]  you see as was exposed in a new york times article and i've written about this extensively
[3:28:47.580 --> 3:28:59.180]  the labs never report to the doctor and the patient in the test results how many cycles the
[3:28:59.180 --> 3:29:09.740]  test was run at they're not required to and they don't report it this is like the cover up of the
[3:29:09.740 --> 3:29:21.500]  century but now somebody in the state of florida or somebody somewhere got the ear of the governor
[3:29:21.500 --> 3:29:32.380]  of florida and showed him that the test is largely being run on a completely fraudulent basis
[3:29:32.380 --> 3:29:41.180]  resulting in the appearance the illusion of greater and greater case numbers therefore
[3:29:42.140 --> 3:29:50.540]  seeming to require new lockdowns well governor de santis in florida does not want to do new
[3:29:50.540 --> 3:30:00.220]  lockdowns and so he was ripe for discovering this enormous fraud and now for those of you
[3:30:00.220 --> 3:30:07.020]  watching this you can see on the screen the memorandum from the florida department of public
[3:30:07.020 --> 3:30:17.100]  health which lists de santis's name at the top requiring laboratories to report the number of
[3:30:17.100 --> 3:30:24.940]  cycles they're running the test at now you could say well the labs could lie and this and that and
[3:30:24.940 --> 3:30:33.660]  they could evade and so on and so forth sure but this is an enormous step in the right direction
[3:30:34.220 --> 3:30:42.140]  this is a long war we're in folks this is not oh i just want to tap something on my app
[3:30:42.860 --> 3:30:51.500]  or computer keyboard and then everything is going to be okay that's not what we're in
[3:30:51.500 --> 3:31:02.300]  we're in the long war and when we see a hint of daylight we need to pursue it
[3:31:03.740 --> 3:31:10.700]  and this is a piece of daylight what florida is doing for two reasons
[3:31:13.020 --> 3:31:20.780]  well first of all if the laboratories start reporting honestly many tests will be rejected
[3:31:20.780 --> 3:31:30.860]  on the basis of too many cycles you ran it at 35 37 39 40 forget it the results are meaningless
[3:31:33.100 --> 3:31:39.820]  now we could see a decline in case numbers in florida and the governor announcing well
[3:31:39.820 --> 3:31:52.620]  we're doing very well here we're not locking down all because they're exposing the lab fraud the lab
[3:31:52.620 --> 3:31:56.700]  fraud so that's number one
[3:31:59.820 --> 3:32:09.020]  number two other states and governors looking at florida could decide to follow suit and do
[3:32:09.020 --> 3:32:17.260]  what florida is doing of course not all states are going to do this but if a few get in line
[3:32:17.260 --> 3:32:24.780]  and decide to do this then we could begin to see a domino effect that would be very hard to control
[3:32:24.780 --> 3:32:38.460]  and number three and perhaps most important i'm appealing to you you the listener you the viewer
[3:32:39.100 --> 3:32:49.260]  you all of the people seeing and hearing this transmission on info wars who want freedom
[3:32:49.260 --> 3:32:56.060]  who don't want lockdowns you have the information that i've given you
[3:33:00.460 --> 3:33:10.140]  you can use it you can make people aware all over the world official politicians doctors
[3:33:10.140 --> 3:33:17.580]  scientists general public freedom fighters all kinds of people that the test is fraudulent
[3:33:17.580 --> 3:33:22.700]  and it's fraudulent for the reasons that i've mentioned about the number of cycles
[3:33:22.700 --> 3:33:30.060]  and that the testing labs are part of the fraud and this needs to be changed now needs to be
[3:33:30.060 --> 3:33:37.020]  exposed i'll have more on exactly what we all need to do after the break don't go anywhere

[3:35:47.820 --> 3:35:55.660]  highest traffic we have ever gotten since the election in 2016 despite all the bands all of the
[3:35:55.660 --> 3:36:00.700]  system trying to censor us to suppress us you with your word of mouth have overwritten that
[3:36:00.700 --> 3:36:04.700]  and they are so scared of info wars dot com in band on video and they're so scared of you
[3:36:04.700 --> 3:36:09.740]  being able to communicate and share the truth but we're bringing in the same amount of money we
[3:36:09.740 --> 3:36:14.060]  brought in last december right now this is our most important month to be able to fund ourselves
[3:36:14.060 --> 3:36:18.220]  in the next year and i understand the economy shut down i understand there's not as much money
[3:36:18.220 --> 3:36:22.380]  as there used to be they're trying to kill trump's recovery but info wars really needs your support
[3:36:22.380 --> 3:36:27.260]  you just buy great items do your christmas shopping and info war store dot com with huge sales
[3:36:27.260 --> 3:36:32.380]  amazing products and then you know you're funding the info war and not funding amazon and jeff bezos
[3:36:32.380 --> 3:36:36.300]  and the globalists that are openly trying to destroy small businesses continue to fund the
[3:36:36.300 --> 3:36:40.140]  second american revolution while getting great products at the same time at info wars store dot
[3:36:40.140 --> 3:36:47.340]  com thank you you must guard your humanity you must guard your children's humanity you must
[3:36:47.340 --> 3:36:52.140]  guard the very genetic code of the planet the globalists have set themselves up as the guardians
[3:36:52.140 --> 3:36:56.860]  of this world but they are the ones that are overriding every genetic system and poisoning the
[3:36:56.860 --> 3:37:04.060]  planet they are the ones that are now engaged in genetic takeover of every human on earth to the
[3:37:04.060 --> 3:37:10.620]  gmo crops and now they've moved on to their main target too madly with the mRNA vaccines which are
[3:37:10.620 --> 3:37:20.540]  not vaccines they are recombinant dna from aborted cloned fetuses were then inserted into your genome
[3:37:20.540 --> 3:37:29.180]  to take over your body's systems go read the actual inserts for the mRNA vaccines and then remember
[3:37:29.180 --> 3:37:34.620]  you've been warned this is the equivalent of an alien takeover whether it's interdimensional
[3:37:34.620 --> 3:37:38.780]  whether it's little green men the globalists are acting like another species that's overtaking us
[3:37:38.780 --> 3:38:01.260]  it's all the same in the end you're listening to the alex jones show boys and girls take
[3:38:01.260 --> 3:38:11.500]  warning okay we're back last segment here for today and look for sneaky snake so i want to
[3:38:11.500 --> 3:38:21.340]  emphasize this if the test pcr test falls goes down in flames all the fake case numbers go down
[3:38:21.340 --> 3:38:29.980]  in flames all of the rationale for the lockdowns disappear the illusion is gone if we expose the
[3:38:29.980 --> 3:38:41.100]  test the whole thing collapses the edifice of fraud and fakery collapses and that is already underway
[3:38:41.100 --> 3:38:46.940]  i'm telling you i've kept my finger on this pulse i've been watching what's happening
[3:38:46.940 --> 3:38:51.660]  over the last nine months as i've been reporting every day updating stories
[3:38:51.660 --> 3:39:02.860]  there is a tremendous wave building of knowledge and truth and reveal meant about the fraudulent
[3:39:02.860 --> 3:39:13.020]  pcr test and now it's up to you to spread the word in every way possible that the test is a
[3:39:13.020 --> 3:39:22.300]  fraud the test must go down it's the cycles stupid it's the test stupid it's the fraudulent test
[3:39:23.580 --> 3:39:33.180]  the evidence is abounding everywhere if the test goes down and falls and is exposed the case
[3:39:33.180 --> 3:39:40.220]  number of fraud is exposed there is no reason for the lockdowns this is the whole gambit that
[3:39:40.220 --> 3:39:47.100]  they're playing you can see it everywhere you look oh the rising case numbers we have to have
[3:39:47.100 --> 3:39:53.660]  new lockdowns and these airheads on the news just keep promoting this crap every day oh we have
[3:39:53.660 --> 3:40:01.660]  gone on three thousand new cases no you don't you have nothing it's a fraudulent pandemic
[3:40:01.660 --> 3:40:09.660]  it's a pandemic of pcr testing it's an outbreak of testing that's all that it is it's nothing
[3:40:09.660 --> 3:40:22.700]  more and it needs to be exposed i've explained exactly why here in the past hour you can grasp it
[3:40:22.700 --> 3:40:33.500]  and see it the certifying agencies of government are saying to run the test in a way that will
[3:40:33.500 --> 3:40:42.620]  automatically produce false positives and rising case numbers the actual science says you have to
[3:40:42.620 --> 3:40:52.860]  run it much lower in terms of cycles or it's a fraud we've got them it's all there on the record
[3:40:54.860 --> 3:41:00.460]  now i've asked people before to spread the word in every possible way they can
[3:41:00.460 --> 3:41:07.500]  and i know that some people do but there are other people who just don't understand what that means
[3:41:08.540 --> 3:41:13.900]  they say well i emailed my friends and they said i was crazy and now i don't know what to do
[3:41:15.900 --> 3:41:23.900]  wow they don't understand that we're in a war i mean is this what george washington said correct
[3:41:23.900 --> 3:41:31.020]  me if i'm wrong when his army was in the midst of winter facing the opposition
[3:41:32.780 --> 3:41:40.300]  the soldiers contracts were running out they were starting to desert and go home the revolution was
[3:41:40.300 --> 3:41:47.900]  on the verge of being lost is that what we're talking about when people say well i sent out
[3:41:47.900 --> 3:41:58.300]  15 emails about this and people just say i'm crazy and you stop that's it that's the end of fighting
[3:41:58.300 --> 3:42:05.660]  for freedom that's the end of your war to get freedom that's the end of your war to expose the
[3:42:05.660 --> 3:42:16.060]  truth are you frigging kidding me how about a thousand emails how about never stopping
[3:42:16.060 --> 3:42:23.980]  how about not caring what other people say how about becoming relentless how about organizing the
[3:42:23.980 --> 3:42:33.900]  truth and sending it out and never stopping if five thousand people did that do you realize
[3:42:33.900 --> 3:42:40.540]  what the growing effect would be it causes a synergistic effect whose consequences can never
[3:42:40.540 --> 3:42:50.140]  be predicted it starts to geometrically expand as people gain knowledge and say my god this is right
[3:42:50.140 --> 3:42:58.940]  the test is fraudulent the whole thing is insane why didn't i see this before you see it now
[3:43:01.100 --> 3:43:03.900]  is that too much to ask for i don't think so
[3:43:03.900 --> 3:43:17.740]  so this is a site called info wars calling for info warriors it ain't mainstream television
[3:43:18.380 --> 3:43:25.740]  it's participatory it's you and us us you
[3:43:25.740 --> 3:43:36.940]  you it's a mix it's everybody working to expose the lies and the truth to bring down
[3:43:39.660 --> 3:43:45.660]  the sociopaths who want to take us all into a horrendous future
[3:43:45.660 --> 3:43:56.940]  at the bottom of the fraud is the test that is what has happened
[3:43:59.020 --> 3:44:04.460]  they have seen by whom i mean the really elite scientists and the globalists
[3:44:05.260 --> 3:44:12.780]  that they needed a way to run a test that would automatically generate fake case numbers
[3:44:12.780 --> 3:44:24.700]  they knew that from the start they devised such a test the pcr they knew that the messaging
[3:44:25.500 --> 3:44:34.220]  from governments and media had to be about rising case numbers in order to justify the lockdowns
[3:44:34.220 --> 3:44:44.780]  so that's what they went with that's what they're still going with it was a plan
[3:44:45.340 --> 3:44:53.900]  they executed the plan we can see that now we know that we have it on the record from Fauci himself
[3:44:55.580 --> 3:45:01.980]  that if you run this test at 35 cycles or higher you automatically get meaningless results
[3:45:01.980 --> 3:45:09.340]  and many of those meaningless results will be false positives meaning new case numbers
[3:45:10.540 --> 3:45:18.140]  and we have it on the record that the fda and the cdc recommend doing the test up to 40 cycles
[3:45:18.140 --> 3:45:28.140]  which is a crime and fraudulent we know this put it together get the word out be an info warrior
[3:45:28.140 --> 3:45:36.700]  don't stop no matter what there will be other people doing what you're doing and you'll never
[3:45:36.700 --> 3:45:46.780]  know them but they'll be doing it too the truth comes in many ways many tsunamis parallel
[3:45:48.540 --> 3:45:54.220]  and when they meet up they're so formidable that nothing can stop them
[3:45:54.220 --> 3:46:03.900]  we also have as i said at the beginning court cases shaping up on this pcr fraud
[3:46:05.260 --> 3:46:12.540]  and now we have the state of florida the first government to my knowledge in a state in the
[3:46:12.540 --> 3:46:21.020]  united states to make this clear that no longer will labs be allowed to just simply report results
[3:46:21.020 --> 3:46:28.300]  they have to say how many cycles we have a portuguese higher court decision
[3:46:29.820 --> 3:46:38.620]  exposing the pcr test as fraud that's the guts of the decision of the court saying that lockdowns
[3:46:38.620 --> 3:46:45.340]  are now illegitimate because they are based on the test we have that on the record as well
[3:46:45.340 --> 3:46:52.620]  well that's what i'm saying people the storm is gathering the storm of truth
[3:46:55.740 --> 3:47:07.660]  join in assist it help it make it bigger defy the odds turn the odds in our favor
[3:47:07.660 --> 3:47:19.340]  the weak point in the enemy has been discovered this is what happens in a war you look at the
[3:47:19.340 --> 3:47:30.540]  enemy the opposition the evil side where are their weaknesses what can be probed to turn
[3:47:30.540 --> 3:47:39.340]  this whole thing around and i've spent the past hour showing that to you it's a big as big a sign
[3:47:39.900 --> 3:47:49.340]  as all of the city of london or paris it's the test it's the test that's their weak point
[3:47:49.900 --> 3:47:58.540]  expose the fraud of the test and the lie and keep on exposing it long enough and the whole
[3:47:58.540 --> 3:48:09.340]  edifice is going to crumble people ask me what can i do what can i do this is something anyone can do
[3:48:13.100 --> 3:48:18.780]  this is how you win a war i'm not saying it's the only thing we need to do by far
[3:48:18.780 --> 3:48:29.180]  but we need to do this and we need to do it now i'm counting on you and i'll see you next time
