[00:00.000 --> 00:18.000]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[00:30.000 --> 00:48.000]  It is the 29th day of January 2012. We're going to be here for the next two hours on this live Sunday edition.
[00:48.000 --> 00:59.000]  I want to thank you all for joining us. I am particularly focused today and I will cover all of this news and information in front of us.
[00:59.000 --> 01:14.000]  I'm going to run down some of that in a moment. But first, I wrote up just in a few minutes before the show just some of the crimes that tie together.
[01:14.000 --> 01:21.000]  And in a project, I'm going to work on a graphic that ties these different pieces of the new order together.
[01:21.000 --> 01:27.000]  And then basically you zoom back from it and it's a big spider sitting on the planet because that's basically what we're facing.
[01:27.000 --> 01:40.000]  And I have a list of issues here. This is just a small list. I'm going to add a lot more and tie it all together. This is just a brainstorm of the crimes the globalists are committing.
[01:40.000 --> 01:49.000]  I think there's probably about 20 or so. I didn't number these points.
[01:49.000 --> 02:07.000]  We're going to be going over that today and just beginning to tie it together in the organized global standardized scientific dictatorship system that is not in complete control, that is not managing everything, but is close to it.
[02:07.000 --> 02:27.000]  And it's trying to standardize the entire planet not to empower humanity, but to absolutely regulate it and control it and shut down the industrial world as we know it, except for high powered government, university and corporate reservations.
[02:27.000 --> 02:40.000]  The rest of us will be reduced down to chattel and it's stated by the UN by the globalist by Maury Strong and many others that they do want to use economic warfare to turn us into chattel.
[02:40.000 --> 02:55.000]  So that is all coming up here today. Aaron Dykes just posted a big article at infowars.com dealing with a satire piece out of the onion.
[02:55.000 --> 03:07.000]  Satire article quips at least 2.3 billion people must die to save the earth. And I noticed they make jokes about implantable microchips. They make jokes about the NDAA.
[03:07.000 --> 03:13.000]  And then all that does is the people that don't really pay attention is I get emails saying you got that from the onion.
[03:13.000 --> 03:26.000]  I noticed this years ago and then later discovered that it's actually a government program. They do have CIA and others inside major tabloids. You can look this up.
[03:26.000 --> 03:34.000]  It's been leaked from time to time that I'll be going through the checkout line, you know, the 18 years or so have been awake the 17 years on air.
[03:34.000 --> 03:43.000]  And I'll always notice bat boy at the capital bat boy, you know, a president meets with aliens. President meets with the creature from the black lagoon.
[03:43.000 --> 03:52.000]  Always something obviously ridiculous. And then around it real things. Governments establishing camps. Governments want you to have an implantable chip.
[03:52.000 --> 04:06.000]  Polio vaccine had cancer virus in it. And then you read the articles and they're written like jokes next to bat boy. So that grandma gets it and thinks, wow, it's all real.
[04:06.000 --> 04:11.000]  And so her son comes home and laughs at her. That's the target audience, mainly.
[04:11.000 --> 04:25.000]  And it's all done so yuppies and people can feel official and just almost subliminally pick up those ridiculous headlines. Mixed in with real stuff like John Edwards caught cheating on his wife.
[04:25.000 --> 04:34.000]  Mixed in with Arnold Schwarzenegger was a Nazi and fish man to visit parliament.
[04:34.000 --> 04:43.000]  So they mixed it all in on purpose and it's been a long term tactic. And it's just very, very sad. All right, we're going to get into that.
[04:43.000 --> 04:59.000]  But huge news on the Second Amendment front. Huge news on the slave factories in China. Huge news on Iran, Bill Gates, the economy. It's all coming up.
[04:59.000 --> 05:04.000]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[05:04.000 --> 05:09.000]  Tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[05:09.000 --> 05:11.000]  It really says that the state is God.
[05:11.000 --> 05:17.000]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[05:17.000 --> 05:23.000]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[05:23.000 --> 05:29.000]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[05:29.000 --> 05:33.000]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[05:33.000 --> 05:43.000]  Repair to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship, body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[05:43.000 --> 05:50.000]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan. The police state isn't coming. It's here.

[06:21.000 --> 06:31.000]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide its Alex Jones.
[06:31.000 --> 06:47.000]  That's right. This radio broadcast worldwide is the number one hardcore voice of reality and true scientific analysis of what is truly happening on this planet.
[06:47.000 --> 06:58.000]  We are number one when it comes to podcasts, number one when it comes to people listening on the internet and exploding on XM and on the AM and FM dial.
[06:58.000 --> 07:05.000]  In fact, I'm going to have my producers flog me tomorrow if I don't mention the 16 new stations we've gotten the last month.
[07:05.000 --> 07:10.000]  The men who do that all last week, but there's just so much news and we are reaching now.
[07:10.000 --> 07:21.000]  Conservatively, if you add up all the different ways we reach people, YouTube, prismplanet.tv, the nightly news, shortwave, AM, FM, XM.
[07:21.000 --> 07:30.000]  Conservatively, 15 million people a week. 15 million people.
[07:30.000 --> 07:36.000]  Rush Limbaugh, it's 22 million, mainly terrestrial radio. 15 million.
[07:36.000 --> 07:48.000]  At this growth rate within one year will be bigger than any U.S.-based political so-called talk show.
[07:48.000 --> 07:55.000]  But you see the old dinosaur media, and that includes neocon outfits, still are legends in their own mind.
[07:55.000 --> 08:10.000]  Still have all the regalia and the bling of the self-anointed leaders. I mean, take MSNBC, their top shows, rarely hit a million listeners.
[08:10.000 --> 08:16.000]  There are morning radio shows in New York City with more listeners than that, with one affiliate.
[08:16.000 --> 08:19.000]  They are legends in their own mind.
[08:19.000 --> 08:25.000]  The only old media that still has gigantic audiences is talk radio, and we're on talk radio.
[08:25.000 --> 08:27.000]  We're also dominating on the Internet.
[08:27.000 --> 08:30.000]  And I just want to give you that report before we get into the news here.
[08:30.000 --> 08:38.000]  And we're going to have some big articles with all the Google analytics and stat brain and Alexa and all of those numbers.
[08:38.000 --> 08:44.000]  We've done these reports periodically, but it's important to give you the listeners who are the backbone of this transmission
[08:44.000 --> 08:49.000]  a report from time to time on how we break down, how many listeners we've got.
[08:49.000 --> 08:54.000]  $15 million is a conservative estimate, and I'm going to have that put together in the next week or two.
[08:54.000 --> 09:03.000]  I'm just so busy hitting the ground running with the six-day-a-week radio shows from 11 to two weekdays central back four to six Sundays.
[09:03.000 --> 09:11.000]  The documentary films, the nightly news, the news websites, the analysis, the breaking news, the gearing up our news force here.
[09:11.000 --> 09:14.000]  But this is the danger zone for us.
[09:14.000 --> 09:22.000]  We've had Nightline, New York Times, MSNBC, New York Daily News, Time Magazine Newsweek.
[09:22.000 --> 09:23.000]  I mean, you name it.
[09:23.000 --> 09:33.000]  Hundreds of establishment dinosaur, kleptocrat, TraderKrat, TraderStream, CessStream, DecepticonStream, New World Order,
[09:33.000 --> 09:41.000]  prostitute, shell out globalist propagandists, hit us with every attack they can.
[09:41.000 --> 09:43.000]  And of course, it's only made us stronger.
[09:43.000 --> 09:50.000]  So now they've gone back to quasi-ignoring, and it's just they're bleeding out in front of us.
[09:50.000 --> 09:57.000]  They're absolutely bleeding out in front of us, and that's why the system now wants to censor the web openly.
[09:57.000 --> 10:07.000]  But more White House cronies, not just Cass Sunstein, the White House regulations are openly calling to shut down websites of those criticizing electric cars.
[10:07.000 --> 10:11.000]  That was even in dinosaur media this week.
[10:11.000 --> 10:17.000]  If you're a new listener, dinosaur, get it, old, extinct media.
[10:17.000 --> 10:23.000]  And there still are some dinosaurs, some species of birds, alligators, crocodiles, they're pre-dinosaur.
[10:23.000 --> 10:29.000]  There'll be a place for them in the swamps, eating dead fish and things.
[10:29.000 --> 10:35.000]  I mean, you know, I understand that, but you can't put the genie back in the bottle.
[10:35.000 --> 10:45.000]  And it's a really good sign that they've gone from being arrogant and trying to ignore the real media to now freaking out with the corporate prostitute media,
[10:45.000 --> 10:52.000]  joining forces with the corrupt kleptocrat government, begging them to also censor talk radio.
[10:52.000 --> 10:58.000]  See, if you have a big audience, the system wants to censor you if you're not going along with their propaganda.
[10:58.000 --> 11:01.000]  In fact, Aaron Dox is pointing out to me, he's got a big report on it.
[11:01.000 --> 11:06.000]  He did one on the nightly news Friday that all this Bill Gates propaganda, I mean, I knew it.
[11:06.000 --> 11:13.000]  I knew he was, he on part of Monsanto and big drug companies and was buying ads on ABC,
[11:13.000 --> 11:17.000]  seeing in all these things that basically act like he may be the second coming of Christ.
[11:17.000 --> 11:26.000]  And that, you know, he, when he goes to the bathroom daisies, you know, fill the toilet bowl and that, you know, his underarms smell like peaches.
[11:26.000 --> 11:33.000]  And that, again, he only helps the little ladies across the street, you know, not that his dad ran Planned Parenthood or that he's an admitted eugenicist
[11:33.000 --> 11:37.000]  and openly makes jokes about reducing the world population down to almost nothing.
[11:37.000 --> 11:44.000]  And you can pull those videos up and where he says, pull the plug on granny killer, you can hire 10 teachers, you can pull that up, just type in what I say.
[11:44.000 --> 11:48.000]  You can type in what I say and do a search engine, you can pull it up.
[11:48.000 --> 11:55.000]  But Aaron was pointing out that in plain view on ABC News, there's banners and that it's sponsored by Bill Gates.
[11:55.000 --> 11:58.000]  And then we looked it up and it's admitted on all these channels.
[11:58.000 --> 12:01.000]  He's actually paying for these reports.
[12:01.000 --> 12:03.000]  It's pure product placement.
[12:03.000 --> 12:13.000]  He's paying to go on TV and run these hoaxes that people like Dr. Wakefield is a liar and discredited when Dr.
[12:13.000 --> 12:16.000]  Wakefield has never agreed that he's a liar and been discredited.
[12:16.000 --> 12:25.000]  And after a decade of his research being confirmed by all these other scientists, they ran a hoax a year ago and he's now suing the British Medical Journal and others.
[12:25.000 --> 12:29.000]  Dr. Wakefield is and there's no dinosaur coverage of that.
[12:29.000 --> 12:33.000]  No dinosaur coverage that he's suing them.
[12:33.000 --> 12:38.000]  The journalist that wrote the article, not the paper for the British Medical Journal.
[12:38.000 --> 12:53.000]  Turns out the British Medical Journal is funded publicly by the very vaccine companies that are losing billions of dollars because people are now finding out that on the insert of the vaccines for MMR, H1N1, regular flu, all of it.
[12:53.000 --> 12:59.000]  It says can cause Guillain-Barre, narcolepsy, death, and a host of other neurological disorders.
[12:59.000 --> 13:15.000]  I mean, they're calling him a conspiracy theorist and saying his research is discredited when the inserts pre his studies said it does this as a side effect.
[13:15.000 --> 13:30.000]  Now, the reason I'm going off this forget all the news and some huge info I'm going to cover coming up is that I did some research on Wakefield as he lives here in Austin and I'm going to be interviewing him soon, probably the first big interview on his lawsuit.
[13:30.000 --> 13:45.000]  And I wanted to do double research on him again before I go to bat for him and I already done it 50 times over before. I mean, I live this stuff, but I went and spent about two hours this morning going back over it.
[13:45.000 --> 13:49.000]  And this is what the corporate prostitute media did. They ran a hoax.
[13:49.000 --> 14:02.000]  It's not like they run hoaxes saying it's the law. You've got to take 50 something vaccines every year. There's no law anywhere. You've got to take vaccines in the United States. Total hoax, but they say it on the news because they're being paid to locally in your town, radio, TV, all of it.
[14:02.000 --> 14:10.000]  It's on record, product placement, propaganda placement. They call it behavior placement now. I coined the term police state placement when they're pushing police state.
[14:10.000 --> 14:22.000]  So I did all this research and I read the reports and it's like he headline was he is accused of unethical medical experiments on children.
[14:22.000 --> 14:34.000]  And you go read it. Parents with autistic children, they would actually do a colonoscopy at a hospital and get and look at the inflammation to prove it was separate from just saying it's a mental illness.
[14:34.000 --> 14:45.000]  There's something going on in the gut of these autistic children and to get stool samples and study it and to find the antibodies for the measles in the MMR shot in their gut.
[14:45.000 --> 14:53.000]  But they spun it with he was doing unethical things with children. What do you think you do in a study? That's what you do.
[14:53.000 --> 15:01.000]  And since then it's all been duplicated. That's why his suit's so powerful. Turns out it had been done in government studies before Wakefield did. He didn't even know about it.
[15:01.000 --> 15:10.000]  See, he's hitting so close to the target and is well spoken and good looking and it's got all these movie stars behind him. It scared him.
[15:10.000 --> 15:18.000]  So they and Bill Gates, you know, he's he's next and all this by the way. Well, I'm just gonna leave it at that.
[15:18.000 --> 15:26.000]  The point is, is that he gets up on TV and says Wakefield scum and a liar and all this stuff with anger in his eyes.
[15:26.000 --> 15:32.000]  Because this is a guy who's into eugenics. You can watch him on Bill Moyers talk about it. Getting rid of people.
[15:32.000 --> 15:40.000]  You can you can type in Bill Gates as vaccines will reduce population. You'll watch him on Ted TV. So see, that's how they run these hoaxes.
[15:40.000 --> 15:51.000]  The the insert, the insert says can cause everything Wakefield talked about. But but they're counting on you being stupid and not going and looking for yourself.
[15:51.000 --> 16:00.000]  So they lie to you. Now I'm going to give you the big news blitz rundown coming up. Huge attacks on the Second Amendment. You name it.

[17:59.000 --> 18:04.000]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[18:04.000 --> 18:08.000]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[18:08.000 --> 18:14.000]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[18:14.000 --> 18:19.000]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[18:19.000 --> 18:24.000]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[18:24.000 --> 18:31.000]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[18:31.000 --> 18:35.000]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[18:35.000 --> 18:40.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[18:40.000 --> 18:45.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[18:45.000 --> 18:51.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.

[19:01.000 --> 19:05.000]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[19:05.000 --> 19:11.000]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream
[19:11.000 --> 19:14.000]  by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[19:14.000 --> 19:18.000]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[19:18.000 --> 19:25.000]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions
[19:25.000 --> 19:30.000]  and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream
[19:30.000 --> 19:34.000]  with continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products.
[19:34.000 --> 19:39.000]  You can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[19:39.000 --> 19:45.000]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[19:45.000 --> 19:52.000]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[19:52.000 --> 20:19.000]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[20:19.000 --> 20:24.000]  We are on the march. The empire is on the run.
[20:24.000 --> 20:36.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[20:36.000 --> 20:44.000]  Okay, let me just run down some of the news I've got here in my stack. I've already had a little bit of it.
[20:44.000 --> 20:56.000]  And then I am going to go over 28 ways the globalists are openly committing crimes and unconstitutional actions against us.
[20:56.000 --> 20:59.000]  And a lot of these tie into news that's out today.
[20:59.000 --> 21:07.000]  And I just wrote these in about a minute or two right before I went on air today because I was just thinking about all of the crimes
[21:07.000 --> 21:15.000]  and outrageous garbage going on and how it's getting worse and how historically that's what tyrannies do.
[21:15.000 --> 21:21.000]  They degenerate because the criminals take over and they won't stop their own minions anymore.
[21:21.000 --> 21:31.000]  And the most wicked basically get promoted to the top and compete with each other and you end up with a hellish situation.
[21:31.000 --> 21:42.000]  And so it's a corrupt worldly attitude with a scientific arrogant overlay where the globalists have learned how to manipulate the general population with different scientific tricks.
[21:42.000 --> 21:48.000]  And they think they can get away with anything now.
[21:48.000 --> 21:57.000]  And they say pride goeth before a fall. These elites constantly screw up. They're in control. They control the money supply, the issuance of currency and credit.
[21:57.000 --> 22:01.000]  But they also screw up and they're not invincible.
[22:01.000 --> 22:09.000]  Sometimes it'd be better if they were in a way invincible and knew what they were doing because they think they know what they're doing.
[22:09.000 --> 22:14.000]  And again, they're in general control, but it's kind of like a captain running a ship on rocks.
[22:14.000 --> 22:18.000]  Okay, he's in control when he does it, but he's still crazy.
[22:18.000 --> 22:24.000]  But here are some of the points I'm going to be going over after I hit some of this news.
[22:24.000 --> 22:32.000]  In DAA, fast and furious government drug dealing, government experimentation on the population, including killing people on record.
[22:32.000 --> 22:35.000]  Why do you ever trust them when they've been caught thousands of times doing it?
[22:35.000 --> 22:45.000]  Government lying, elites exempt from laws and taxes, biggest prison population in the world, period, all over the world they're growing bigger than they've ever been.
[22:45.000 --> 22:47.000]  And the U.S. has the record.
[22:47.000 --> 22:56.000]  In fact, I imbed it to you, but I didn't see it in my stack. You print me that New Yorker magazine article that just came out called America Caged.
[22:56.000 --> 22:59.000]  Thank you.
[22:59.000 --> 23:04.000]  Fluoride, seven-fold bone cancer, brain damage.
[23:04.000 --> 23:09.000]  It accelerates and magnifies all other drugs in the system on record.
[23:09.000 --> 23:14.000]  Forced inoculations, lying about it, all the death and problems from vaccines.
[23:14.000 --> 23:20.000]  GMOs in every study, there's thousands of them in the rats and guinea pigs, but they block human studies.
[23:20.000 --> 23:36.000]  Just total organ failure, heart problems, brain problems, sterilization, militarization of police, all the telltale signs, the surveillance society, general corruption, all the corruption, they're constantly getting caught in.
[23:36.000 --> 23:44.000]  Web censorship, now being admitted, all the out-of-control spying without warrants, totally illegal.
[23:44.000 --> 23:47.000]  See, the Bill of Rights and Constitution protects you.
[23:47.000 --> 23:52.000]  And once you get rid of it and similar systems worldwide, it always gets bad.
[23:52.000 --> 23:54.000]  There's reasons those protections are there.
[23:54.000 --> 24:01.000]  And people that always have these excuses for why we should not do this or not do that are, oh, just to bridge it a little bit.
[24:01.000 --> 24:08.000]  Or let's have contempt for the Constitution like Newsweek and Time magazine have been having cover stories about, like it caused our problems.
[24:08.000 --> 24:10.000]  They're also scapegoating capitalism.
[24:10.000 --> 24:13.000]  The monopoly men don't like capitalism, folks. They're getting rid of it now.
[24:13.000 --> 24:16.000]  Davos is announcing that.
[24:16.000 --> 24:24.000]  And they're using the fact that the elites don't pay taxes, or very little, to twist it and say, see, raise taxes on those making $100,000 a year.
[24:24.000 --> 24:26.000]  That'll get the rich guy.
[24:26.000 --> 24:29.000]  Somebody making $20,000 a year? Yeah, it sounds good.
[24:29.000 --> 24:31.000]  Oh, man, these people are so sick.
[24:31.000 --> 24:40.000]  But I want to say they're sophisticated only by the public not being sophisticated or being lazy, not deciding to decode how they operate.
[24:40.000 --> 24:42.000]  It's the only way they get away with this.
[24:42.000 --> 24:48.000]  It's all the ultra-rich that are lobbying constantly for big government because they get the government contracts.
[24:48.000 --> 24:52.000]  In fact, I have a video later, an audio. I'm going to play breaking that down.
[24:52.000 --> 25:05.000]  General corruption, web censorship, spying, technology suppression, what they call disruptive technology, which means anything that the globalist would hurt any of their monopolies or combines.
[25:05.000 --> 25:07.000]  That's big.
[25:07.000 --> 25:10.000]  I mean, they've killed people over that if they won't sell.
[25:10.000 --> 25:32.000]  A national security dictatorship, that whole COG system where they tell Congress they can't see the COG plans when the Congress is the government on record and finally a copy of NDAA and the National Defense Authorization Act tie into Presidential Decision Directive 51,
[25:32.000 --> 25:40.000]  openly states in the cover page they gave Congress the synopsis that Congress is abolished and that secret groups will run the government.
[25:40.000 --> 25:52.000]  And I've got articles about that where they're taking over major cities, private corporations are, and suspending the governments and saying you have no rights because you're bankrupt.
[25:52.000 --> 25:55.000]  And it was all done by fraud.
[25:55.000 --> 26:04.000]  You can't suspend people's rights just because a city is bankrupt, just because a corporation comes into the state and says it, and we're in trouble.
[26:04.000 --> 26:07.000]  This has all been done in third world countries over and over again and been tested.
[26:07.000 --> 26:11.000]  And now the globalists are going for Europe, the US, and wealthy areas of Asia.
[26:11.000 --> 26:13.000]  It's called the New World Order.
[26:13.000 --> 26:16.000]  It's a global corporate dictatorship through fraud.
[26:16.000 --> 26:18.000]  People say, well, let us have a world government, man.
[26:18.000 --> 26:20.000]  It's peace like Star Trek.
[26:20.000 --> 26:21.000]  No, no, no.
[26:21.000 --> 26:24.000]  This isn't where we vote into a world government and it's democratic.
[26:24.000 --> 26:32.000]  This is secret tribunals making the decisions continuing here.
[26:32.000 --> 26:35.000]  National Security Dictatorship globally.
[26:35.000 --> 26:39.000]  Environmental takeover, not about the environment.
[26:39.000 --> 26:45.000]  I mean, it's even in my own house, an HEB bag that says all of us should do our part for the environment.
[26:45.000 --> 26:48.000]  Don't use disposable bags.
[26:48.000 --> 26:50.000]  And then now they're banning disposable bags.
[26:50.000 --> 26:58.000]  And whether they're good or bad, the point is this is all about making us do what they say because it's for the environment.
[26:58.000 --> 27:05.000]  All ignoring genetic modification, toxic waste dumping, radiation levels going up all over the world.
[27:05.000 --> 27:12.000]  Now they just raise the levels of isotopes in some cases 100,000 times and just say, well, it's safe now for you.
[27:12.000 --> 27:16.000]  That was in the news a few months ago, but now it's happening globally in a standardized move.
[27:16.000 --> 27:22.000]  Governments are raising what they say is safe radiation.
[27:22.000 --> 27:25.000]  Oh, the TSA doesn't test their machines like everybody else does.
[27:25.000 --> 27:26.000]  Oh, you know what?
[27:26.000 --> 27:30.000]  Maybe we'll just have radiology departments not test X-ray machines anymore.
[27:30.000 --> 27:32.000]  I mean, they're actually talking about that.
[27:32.000 --> 27:41.000]  It's like actually poison the river, dump poison everywhere, but then make everybody go, I've got my reusable bag,
[27:41.000 --> 27:46.000]  which they admit is just a post-industrial move to shut down our coal, our energy.
[27:46.000 --> 27:51.000]  I mean, when the city of Austin announced 80% tax hikes on many power users,
[27:51.000 --> 27:57.000]  two weeks ago, they said, well, it was actually on the news radio and TV playing clips of the city council.
[27:57.000 --> 27:59.000]  They said, hey, you're going to pay more.
[27:59.000 --> 28:00.000]  It's for the earth.
[28:00.000 --> 28:07.000]  You're using too much power, but that's not even the reason they allowed big mega corporations to come in and shut down all the city owned utilities
[28:07.000 --> 28:16.000]  and smaller companies just so they could then shut down their competition and just jack up prices and just say, hey, it's for the earth.
[28:16.000 --> 28:25.000]  Well, they have tax incentives on record to move General Motors factories to China and Brazil and Romania,
[28:25.000 --> 28:32.000]  tens of billions of dollars of your bailout money to them, to move publicly, to move out of the country.
[28:32.000 --> 28:37.000]  And China gets three new coal plants a week. We get nothing.
[28:37.000 --> 28:41.000]  By the way, when Obama shut down that pipeline to bring oil from Canada to the U.S.,
[28:41.000 --> 28:51.000]  it turns out Berkshire Hathaway has the train contract Bloomberg reported to ship the oil to the west coast of Canada and ship it to China.
[28:51.000 --> 28:55.000]  The globalists are shutting off our energy. They're not Americans.
[28:55.000 --> 29:01.000]  They're shutting America off. They own the investments overseas.
[29:01.000 --> 29:05.000]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[29:05.000 --> 29:09.000]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[29:09.000 --> 29:14.000]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[29:14.000 --> 29:20.000]  It has tremendous influence on our president and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[29:20.000 --> 29:25.000]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[29:25.000 --> 29:35.000]  The fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal off-short cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[29:35.000 --> 29:41.000]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and Arsonists, they're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[29:41.000 --> 29:48.000]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[32:04.000 --> 32:05.000]  tyranny is here.
[32:05.000 --> 32:09.000]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[32:09.000 --> 32:11.000]  It really says that the state is God.
[32:11.000 --> 32:17.000]  The United States has now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states on earth.
[32:17.000 --> 32:24.000]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[32:24.000 --> 32:30.000]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old powerful shadow state.
[32:30.000 --> 32:34.000]  Police state 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[32:34.000 --> 32:38.000]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[32:38.000 --> 32:44.000]  Body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[32:44.000 --> 32:47.000]  It's only the beginning of the new world order's hellish plan.
[32:47.000 --> 32:49.000]  The police state isn't coming.
[32:49.000 --> 32:50.000]  It's here.

[33:17.000 --> 33:24.000]  See, you're brought up in school and you're taught everything's free market.
[33:24.000 --> 33:30.000]  And when something's privatized, there's bids that are put out.
[33:30.000 --> 33:37.000]  And then companies go put out the bids and whoever has the best price and the best quality, they get the government bid.
[33:37.000 --> 33:47.000]  No, the truth is, politicians are funded from the time that their city council people are even lower in the chain on boards.
[33:47.000 --> 33:58.000]  And the system comes and finds who is the most corrupt and their wives get jobs at the companies they sell out to, their sons get jobs, their husbands get jobs.
[33:58.000 --> 34:09.000]  And many times now they even insider trade and give government contracts directly at the state, local and federal level to companies their family owns.
[34:09.000 --> 34:18.000]  And when they get caught in 2011, 2012, I showed you the article last week, CBS News, Congress allowed to insider trade.
[34:18.000 --> 34:20.000]  Of course, I checked the law.
[34:20.000 --> 34:22.000]  It's totally illegal.
[34:22.000 --> 34:25.000]  Congress people went to jail for that 20 years ago.
[34:25.000 --> 34:28.000]  Not now they don't.
[34:28.000 --> 34:31.000]  It's a national security dictatorship.
[34:31.000 --> 34:34.000]  And you notice everything's circling the drain now.
[34:34.000 --> 34:36.000]  You notice suddenly the prosperity is leaving.
[34:36.000 --> 34:42.000]  You notice suddenly everything's going up in price because they're devaluing the dollar.
[34:42.000 --> 34:46.000]  Because they are shutting down all their competition.
[34:46.000 --> 34:49.000]  They're shutting down the market.
[34:49.000 --> 34:53.000]  I mean, I told you five years ago when the decisions were made and announced.
[34:53.000 --> 35:01.000]  Back when Bush was in, I said, if you live in Austin, Texas, it's one of the few cities that's been totally taken over by these people.
[35:01.000 --> 35:09.000]  Regardless of who even gets in office federally, you're going to be paying more for power because Austin signed on to the UN agreement.
[35:09.000 --> 35:15.000]  To shut down power plants around it and to only let big globalist companies sell power.
[35:15.000 --> 35:20.000]  And so they go out with a straight face and say the average person will only have a 40% increase.
[35:20.000 --> 35:25.000]  Last year it was 20, but some will have an 80% increase.
[35:25.000 --> 35:27.000]  And we need this for a budgetary shortfall.
[35:27.000 --> 35:29.000]  No, that's another lie.
[35:29.000 --> 35:33.000]  People just think that the money just goes around the city.
[35:33.000 --> 35:34.000]  No, no, it goes.
[35:34.000 --> 35:37.000]  Most of it goes to the company that's doing the service.
[35:37.000 --> 35:39.000]  It's not privatization.
[35:39.000 --> 35:49.000]  And then libertarians, many of them aren't sophisticated enough to know the difference between a real privatization and a fascist insider, crony capitalist scam.
[35:49.000 --> 36:03.000]  See, racketeering and organized crime is the standardization and legalization and is a global revolution by the criminal class against free humanity.
[36:03.000 --> 36:08.000]  And all I do is read their white papers, their books, their communiques, and it's all public.
[36:08.000 --> 36:15.000]  They operate like you are lobotomized idiots.
[36:15.000 --> 36:23.000]  Because they've taught in school and in this culture that it is a virtue not to care.
[36:23.000 --> 36:30.000]  That it is a virtue, I mean adults, people in business look at you like a weirdo.
[36:30.000 --> 36:41.000]  If at dinner you try to bring up to them power generation and the history of electricity and how markets work.
[36:41.000 --> 36:49.000]  If you bring up to someone what sodium fluoride is bad for you and they start laughing and you say, no, no, let me pull up some studies for you.
[36:49.000 --> 36:51.000]  Let me explain sodium fluoride.
[36:51.000 --> 36:55.000]  You just type in sodium fluoride cancer and you'll get major medical journals.
[36:55.000 --> 36:59.000]  They've known it for hundreds of years.
[36:59.000 --> 37:01.000]  And they just go, man, you're weird.
[37:01.000 --> 37:03.000]  You like no stuff.
[37:03.000 --> 37:15.000]  A lot of times people are like awe inspired that someone knows about stocks and bonds or someone knows about the periodic table or that you know about anything.
[37:15.000 --> 37:19.000]  It's like you're a kook to be informed.
[37:19.000 --> 37:31.000]  Folks, our country was founded by people that were into speaking four or five languages, including Latin, and who discovered and harnessed electricity, Benjamin Franklin,
[37:31.000 --> 37:41.000]  and who, all of them were inventors and scientists and into being incredibly intelligent and they weren't showing off.
[37:41.000 --> 37:46.000]  You read a 1777, 78 newspaper.
[37:46.000 --> 37:59.000]  I have a gigantic vocabulary and can even speed read and I have trouble reading an average newspaper and literacy was higher in the 1770s than it is now.
[37:59.000 --> 38:01.000]  You know who the rock stars were?
[38:01.000 --> 38:03.000]  They were inventors.
[38:03.000 --> 38:05.000]  You know who the rock stars were?
[38:05.000 --> 38:13.000]  They were the scientists and the public wanted to be like that and the whole world marveled at the United States invented almost everything.
[38:13.000 --> 38:15.000]  And they weren't wimps either.
[38:15.000 --> 38:20.000]  Everyone was very polite because if you slighted someone, they'd say, step outside.
[38:20.000 --> 38:25.000]  You want swords or pistols, pal.
[38:25.000 --> 38:35.000]  And if the person wouldn't retract the statement, they'd walk up and slap them across the face and say, you will come outside.
[38:35.000 --> 38:41.000]  So I don't, you know, men nowadays think it's not manly to understand knowledge.
[38:41.000 --> 38:43.000]  There's nothing more manly.
[38:43.000 --> 38:45.000]  It's the essence of being a man.
[38:45.000 --> 38:48.000]  It's the essence of being a woman.
[38:48.000 --> 38:50.000]  It's the essence of being a human.
[38:50.000 --> 38:55.000]  It's the essence of an awake, conscious person.
[38:55.000 --> 39:00.000]  And ladies and gentlemen, I only give you a fraction of my knowledge and it's all public source.
[39:00.000 --> 39:06.000]  If I told you my full understanding of this, I can see the entire architecture of the New World Order.
[39:06.000 --> 39:08.000]  I have immersed myself so deeply in it.
[39:08.000 --> 39:12.000]  I have studied them and I'm here to tell those that serve it even at high levels.
[39:12.000 --> 39:20.000]  Most of you I've studied you were picked because you're competitive, you're highly intelligent, but you're compartmentalized.
[39:20.000 --> 39:21.000]  You're a specialist.
[39:21.000 --> 39:27.000]  I'm a general knowledge person, a wide spectrum, a full spectrum.
[39:27.000 --> 39:34.000]  You are signing on to something that is going to destroy you as well.
[39:34.000 --> 39:45.000]  This hyper-crazy eugenics dominant system is undoubtedly going to either destroy this species or bring us awfully close to it.
[39:45.000 --> 39:59.000]  And when you respond to the establishment with simple facts like, hey, we'd better look at what you're doing in the case of weaponized viruses.
[39:59.000 --> 40:03.000]  And they giggle and laugh about it.
[40:03.000 --> 40:07.000]  I mean, Dick Cheney wrote public policy papers in 2000.
[40:07.000 --> 40:09.000]  One of them was rebuilding America's defenses.
[40:09.000 --> 40:10.000]  It's public.
[40:10.000 --> 40:13.000]  It's type of building America's defenses, white paper.
[40:13.000 --> 40:15.000]  And they say we're getting the race specific weapons ready.
[40:15.000 --> 40:18.000]  We got to have the media prepare the public for their use.
[40:18.000 --> 40:20.000]  Oh, man.
[40:20.000 --> 40:24.000]  Oh, and I usually attack the Austin American statesman.
[40:24.000 --> 40:30.000]  One of three national papers that actually wrote editorials against it was the Austin American statesman.
[40:30.000 --> 40:32.000]  So I got to commend that.
[40:32.000 --> 40:36.000]  Broken clocks are occasionally right, as you know, twice a day.
[40:36.000 --> 40:45.000]  But these people are so confident that that's going to be their downfall.
[40:45.000 --> 40:49.000]  And I've gone from hating the globalists and being disgusted by them to now.
[40:49.000 --> 40:54.000]  I'm just bewildered in my knowledge that they're stunted.
[40:54.000 --> 41:05.000]  They're able to carry out these anti-human destructive activities so they're in dominant position as psychopaths, sociopaths, twisted people.
[41:05.000 --> 41:07.000]  And I studied civilization.
[41:07.000 --> 41:18.000]  In every culture, psychopaths, when they get in control, build like a snail grows a certain type of shell or a plant, you know, goes towards the heat in the sun.
[41:18.000 --> 41:20.000]  It's a tropism.
[41:20.000 --> 41:25.000]  You know, ducks quack, sharks bite, fish swim. It's a tropism.
[41:25.000 --> 41:27.000]  Men fight.
[41:27.000 --> 41:29.000]  Women preen.
[41:29.000 --> 41:31.000]  Women love. Women nurture.
[41:31.000 --> 41:33.000]  It's a tropism.
[41:33.000 --> 41:35.000]  And they build architectures.
[41:35.000 --> 41:40.000]  And now with advanced technology, it's like a mutating architecture.
[41:40.000 --> 41:46.000]  But I see, like Eskimo art, a new art where it has the multi-face variant every angle you look at it.
[41:46.000 --> 41:54.000]  I see all the past generations of it and how it all intertwines like a kaleidoscope, like a carousel.
[41:54.000 --> 41:59.000]  And every permutation, I'm able to predict now what they're going to do.
[41:59.000 --> 42:05.000]  And they've got supercomputers that do it as well and idiot savants that handle future predictive systems.
[42:05.000 --> 42:10.000]  They're on 50-year and 20-year and 10-year and overall 100-year programs.
[42:10.000 --> 42:16.000]  Mr. Bignie Brzezinski, another top globalist, admit that. And now I can think of their program once I discover a new piece of it
[42:16.000 --> 42:22.000]  and use their NSA search engine, Panoptagon, to look into what they're doing.
[42:22.000 --> 42:28.000]  And sure enough, what I have envisioned them doing, I will find word for word in their own public white papers,
[42:28.000 --> 42:30.000]  but from their twisted perspective.
[42:30.000 --> 42:33.000]  And it is, it is, it is unbelievable.
[42:33.000 --> 42:38.000]  I mean, I cannot even begin to describe to you, ladies and gentlemen,
[42:38.000 --> 42:43.000]  that what we're seeing is the formation of a truly false artificial habitat
[42:43.000 --> 42:46.000]  that the globalists have built for the general public.
[42:46.000 --> 42:51.000]  That is a, that is a slow, straight jacket, boa constrictor kill grid.
[42:51.000 --> 42:56.000]  But I can see the permutations within it, the blowback on the elite and the rest of it.
[42:56.000 --> 42:58.000]  It's going to kill everybody.
[43:00.000 --> 43:07.000]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[43:07.000 --> 43:12.000]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[43:12.000 --> 43:21.000]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[43:21.000 --> 43:29.000]  They so pride in every stitch guarantee you love the way they fit.
[43:29.000 --> 43:34.000]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[43:34.000 --> 43:39.000]  Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[43:39.000 --> 43:43.000]  We turned jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans.
[43:43.000 --> 43:46.000]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[43:46.000 --> 43:50.000]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection
[43:50.000 --> 43:52.000]  so you can ride all day with confidence.
[43:52.000 --> 43:55.000]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[43:55.000 --> 44:05.000]  Diamond gusset jeans got it, others don't.
[44:25.000 --> 44:29.000]  Now a new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[44:29.000 --> 44:32.000]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[44:32.000 --> 44:36.000]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[44:36.000 --> 44:41.000]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[44:41.000 --> 44:46.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors.
[44:46.000 --> 44:52.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[44:52.000 --> 44:56.000]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to www.mysolarbackup.com
[44:56.000 --> 45:00.000]  or call 1-877-327-0365.
[45:00.000 --> 45:03.000]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[45:03.000 --> 45:08.000]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[45:08.000 --> 45:10.000]  Saving means to make money.
[45:10.000 --> 45:13.000]  The Calben Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars
[45:13.000 --> 45:17.000]  and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated
[45:17.000 --> 45:19.000]  and twice as good as what you're using now.
[45:19.000 --> 45:24.000]  These are soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes,
[45:24.000 --> 45:27.000]  perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[45:27.000 --> 45:31.000]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes,
[45:31.000 --> 45:35.000]  itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[45:35.000 --> 45:38.000]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before,
[45:38.000 --> 45:40.000]  you have to do something you've never done before.
[45:40.000 --> 45:45.000]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091
[45:45.000 --> 45:49.000]  or see Calben on the Web at 5starsoap.com.
[45:49.000 --> 45:53.000]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091
[45:53.000 --> 45:57.000]  or see Calben on the Web at 5starsoap.com.
[46:01.000 --> 46:05.000]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[46:05.000 --> 46:08.000]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[46:08.000 --> 46:10.000]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[46:10.000 --> 46:13.000]  we'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[46:13.000 --> 46:17.000]  I have a tremendous influence on our president and Congress,
[46:17.000 --> 46:19.000]  and they really are calling the shots.
[46:19.000 --> 46:24.000]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[46:24.000 --> 46:27.000]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation,
[46:27.000 --> 46:32.000]  the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty,
[46:32.000 --> 46:34.000]  and on its ashes constructing world government.
[46:34.000 --> 46:37.000]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[46:37.000 --> 46:39.000]  They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying,
[46:39.000 --> 46:41.000]  who do we make the checkout to?
[46:41.000 --> 46:43.000]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[46:43.000 --> 46:48.000]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[46:48.000 --> 46:53.000]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.
[46:53.000 --> 47:12.000]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[47:24.000 --> 47:28.000]  Okay, we are back, ladies and gentlemen.
[47:28.000 --> 47:32.000]  If you're a new listener, I would suggest that you go online.
[47:32.000 --> 47:36.000]  You can buy the DVDs at infowars.com and watch them in high quality.
[47:36.000 --> 47:42.000]  But if not, they're all free on thousands of video services.
[47:42.000 --> 47:45.000]  Endgame, Terror Storm.
[47:45.000 --> 47:49.000]  Or you can go to some of my newer films like Obama Deception, Fall of the Republic.
[47:49.000 --> 47:54.000]  You can watch films I made 13, 14, 15 years ago, Police Day 2000,
[47:54.000 --> 47:56.000]  America Destroyed by Design.
[47:56.000 --> 48:04.000]  Go watch one of those films that were seen as off the charts insane at the time.
[48:04.000 --> 48:07.000]  And then now look at the way we live.
[48:07.000 --> 48:10.000]  People see these films today and are blown away.
[48:10.000 --> 48:12.000]  They say, my gosh, this guy predicted everything.
[48:12.000 --> 48:15.000]  I didn't predict anything.
[48:15.000 --> 48:21.000]  The social engineers, see this planet isn't run by the best looking.
[48:21.000 --> 48:26.000]  It isn't run by the person that's the smartest at building the best computer chip.
[48:26.000 --> 48:31.000]  It's run at the people that know how to use government and systems to take control of that.
[48:31.000 --> 48:38.000]  It's run by Ponzi scheme operators who learned how to get people to accept their fiat money.
[48:38.000 --> 48:44.000]  And once private banks get control of your country and can issue the currency like the private Federal Reserve,
[48:44.000 --> 48:46.000]  it's over.
[48:46.000 --> 48:48.000]  People like, well, why do they want to wreck the economy then?
[48:48.000 --> 48:52.000]  Because they want to consolidate it.
[48:52.000 --> 48:56.000]  Because the globalists made a deal with the Chinese and the Chinese communists took the deal
[48:56.000 --> 49:02.000]  to use their population as slaves to reduce their population as part of the eugenics agreement.
[49:02.000 --> 49:08.000]  They sent Ambassador George Herbert Walker Bush over there who'd run the Native American program in the 70s.
[49:08.000 --> 49:11.000]  He was a rock star of eugenics.
[49:11.000 --> 49:13.000]  He got over half the Native Americans sterilized.
[49:13.000 --> 49:18.000]  Just type in Native Americans sterilized at reservations in the 1970s.
[49:18.000 --> 49:22.000]  So they sent him to China before Nixon went and they publicly said,
[49:22.000 --> 49:27.000]  put in a one-child policy, reduce your population, we will ship all the industry here,
[49:27.000 --> 49:32.000]  and in turn our plan is to leverage out all free market competition and drive down wages there.
[49:32.000 --> 49:35.000]  We want an impoverished controlled population.
[49:35.000 --> 49:37.000]  And now you hear that, oh, austerity is cool.
[49:37.000 --> 49:41.000]  You go to Whole Foods, there's all these magazines about how cool it is to be poor,
[49:41.000 --> 49:45.000]  how cool it is to have nothing, how great it is to pay more for your power bill.
[49:45.000 --> 49:48.000]  I mean, our own city council where I'm broadcasting you to from Austin said,
[49:48.000 --> 49:51.000]  hey, we want to massively increase your power, it's for the earth.
[49:51.000 --> 49:55.000]  No, it's for scumbag criminals that have taken control.
[49:55.000 --> 49:57.000]  It's called austerity.
[49:57.000 --> 50:03.000]  It's done in every third world country by the IMF and World Bank, holding companies for the globalists.
[50:03.000 --> 50:07.000]  And so they're able to shut you down.
[50:07.000 --> 50:10.000]  The real power is in monopolies.
[50:10.000 --> 50:13.000]  The real power is in the green police coming in your house.
[50:13.000 --> 50:18.000]  They're not going to get in trouble for a big company with Bill Gates owning Monsanto
[50:18.000 --> 50:23.000]  with corn that produces its own pesticide where the bugs die if they eat it,
[50:23.000 --> 50:29.000]  but then they just say it's safe for you to eat that causes organ failure in all the studies with the rats.
[50:29.000 --> 50:31.000]  That's not an environmental problem.
[50:31.000 --> 50:32.000]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[50:32.000 --> 50:37.000]  The carbon dioxide you exhale, that's the problem and you're the problem.
[50:37.000 --> 50:41.000]  You pull Bill Gates up saying humans are bad because they exhale carbon dioxide.
[50:41.000 --> 50:42.000]  Ted TV.
[50:42.000 --> 50:43.000]  Pull it up.
[50:43.000 --> 50:45.000]  It's all over the place.
[50:45.000 --> 50:47.000]  Bill Gates admits the reducing population.
[50:47.000 --> 50:48.000]  Type it in.
[50:48.000 --> 50:49.000]  Watch him.
[50:49.000 --> 50:53.000]  Bill Gates says it's that, what do they call it?
[50:53.000 --> 50:55.000]  That death panels are real.
[50:55.000 --> 50:57.000]  Bill Gates calls for death panels.
[50:57.000 --> 50:58.000]  That's the name of the video.
[50:58.000 --> 50:59.000]  Go watch it.
[50:59.000 --> 51:03.000]  He's just one of these little sickos that think of you as dumb animals.
[51:03.000 --> 51:07.000]  And you know what, when you act like it, that only validates what they're saying and doing.
[51:07.000 --> 51:08.000]  But here's the deal.
[51:08.000 --> 51:10.000]  I'm not a dumb animal.
[51:10.000 --> 51:11.000]  I know what you're doing.
[51:11.000 --> 51:16.000]  And I'm not an immoral control freak scumbag and I'm not going to join you.
[51:16.000 --> 51:20.000]  Even though there's been entrees into that many times, you can kill me right now.
[51:20.000 --> 51:22.000]  I will never join you.
[51:22.000 --> 51:25.000]  I will never sign on to what you do.
[51:25.000 --> 51:26.000]  I will never commit suicide either.
[51:26.000 --> 51:27.000]  I love life so much.
[51:27.000 --> 51:29.000]  I'm ready to lay my life down.
[51:29.000 --> 51:31.000]  You got that?
[51:31.000 --> 51:33.000]  It's not just for my children.
[51:33.000 --> 51:38.000]  I love everybody's children so much that I've signed my whole family on to this and I'm fearless.
[51:38.000 --> 51:40.000]  Whatever comes, I'm in God's hands.
[51:40.000 --> 51:44.000]  You can't threaten me because I am beyond rhythm.
[51:44.000 --> 51:45.000]  I have seen reality.
[51:45.000 --> 51:47.000]  I have seen what you're doing.
[51:47.000 --> 51:49.000]  And I want humanity to survive and thrive.
[51:49.000 --> 51:52.000]  And I'm not going to be part of what you're doing.
[51:52.000 --> 51:57.000]  And all of you listening out there, ladies and gentlemen, you know when you're gut, I'm right.
[51:57.000 --> 51:58.000]  And your gut is not your gut.
[51:58.000 --> 52:05.000]  Your gut is your subconscious, conservatively, 100 times or more powerful than your conscious mind.
[52:05.000 --> 52:07.000]  You already know all of this.
[52:07.000 --> 52:09.000]  You already know I'm telling you the truth.
[52:09.000 --> 52:15.000]  Trust but verify as Ronald Reagan said, go look into what I've told you.
[52:15.000 --> 52:27.000]  Listen, I've been screaming for at least 15 years about government programs worldwide to weaponize every zoological virus or bacteria so we can attack humans.
[52:27.000 --> 52:33.000]  And human to human transmitted diseases as well.
[52:33.000 --> 52:35.000]  And here's the London Independent today.
[52:35.000 --> 52:39.000]  Research in the mutant flu must go on.
[52:39.000 --> 52:47.000]  Scientists dismiss U.S. groups fear the creation of airborne H5N1 virus could inspire bioterrorism.
[52:47.000 --> 52:50.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, they've airborne weaponized Ebola.
[52:50.000 --> 52:59.000]  They've airborne weaponized hundreds of flus, mousepox that kills 99% of any mammal species they designed it for.
[52:59.000 --> 53:11.000]  And the government of Australia under UN directive put the blueprint to build it easily for about $200,000 on the Internet five years ago.
[53:11.000 --> 53:18.000]  Now, the globalists are doing all this so there's plausible deniability once this stuff gets released.
[53:18.000 --> 53:20.000]  And I don't know how long we've got.
[53:20.000 --> 53:21.000]  We may have 10 years.
[53:21.000 --> 53:24.000]  We may have 16 minutes.
[53:24.000 --> 53:34.000]  I know the British government on record plain view got caught launching a foot and mouth zoological attack on sheep and cows on bovine in 2000.
[53:34.000 --> 53:36.000]  I said it was a government op.
[53:36.000 --> 53:43.000]  And then it came out on the news a year later small footnotes BBC London Guardian that indeed it was a government laboratory.
[53:43.000 --> 53:49.000]  But they said it must have been animal rights activists within it that are against domesticated animals.
[53:49.000 --> 53:58.000]  You think animal rights activists stole that out of a level four bio weapons lab and dispersed it over several hundred sites in a matter of a day.
[53:58.000 --> 54:02.000]  And then it popped up simultaneously all over the UK.
[54:02.000 --> 54:06.000]  No, that was that was done on an industrial scale.
[54:06.000 --> 54:08.000]  That's how I knew it was government.
[54:08.000 --> 54:14.000]  Fast acting I went and looked up put mouth dad veterinarians on did my research.
[54:14.000 --> 54:15.000]  I live in the real world.
[54:15.000 --> 54:20.000]  I don't know about I don't know who's in the playoffs right now with the NFL or has even gotten the Super Bowl.
[54:20.000 --> 54:21.000]  I don't know all that.
[54:21.000 --> 54:22.000]  I'm sorry.
[54:22.000 --> 54:23.000]  I'm not a man.
[54:23.000 --> 54:24.000]  I'm not deaf.
[54:24.000 --> 54:30.000]  But I do know about stuff that can kill my whole darling family and my sweet little three year old.
[54:30.000 --> 54:34.000]  Every time I look at her, I want to cry.
[54:34.000 --> 54:41.000]  And I do know there's only a matter of time because the global is to promise to release this stuff.
[54:41.000 --> 54:46.000]  Now the first wave is probably only going to kill a few million people because they studied them.
[54:46.000 --> 54:51.000]  They want to use that to practice to beta test mistakes they make and deposes the saviors.
[54:51.000 --> 55:03.000]  So when they release the big attack, they can sell the public on giving up all of their rights under a medical dictatorship for the big attack that comes after.
[55:03.000 --> 55:06.000]  They may do it in three rounds, each one getting ours.
[55:06.000 --> 55:07.000]  They may do it in one big one.
[55:07.000 --> 55:15.000]  Remember, I'm able to guess what they're going to do by studying them to such a point that I did say the government would launch a bio attack on 9 11.
[55:15.000 --> 55:25.000]  I said there's a bio attack has been launched, I believe, and it could probably be something like anthrax and it'll be used to bring them through more police state.
[55:25.000 --> 55:33.000]  And it's on record, the September 11th broadcast, it's on the line and September 12th and the ADL September 12th attacked me and had the quote.
[55:33.000 --> 55:40.000]  It's what they're saying is the ADL, nothing about Jews in my statement, but the ADL attacked me.
[55:40.000 --> 55:52.000]  I guess that's a good, you know, grip to paint you with tar and said Alex Jones says the government's released a bio weapon and it'll happen.
[55:52.000 --> 55:54.000]  It will see it the next month.
[55:54.000 --> 56:09.000]  I mean, I just, of course, I knew because in the Rand Corporation documents that were public and the preconditioning I saw in the news, I noticed that there was some anthrax prehyping.
[56:09.000 --> 56:13.000]  See, how do I know when Coca Cola is coming out with a new flavor?
[56:13.000 --> 56:15.000]  You see the ads.
[56:15.000 --> 56:20.000]  You know when Dodge is coming out with a new car because you see the ads.
[56:20.000 --> 56:21.000]  I mean, it's marketing.
[56:21.000 --> 56:24.000]  I'm a media person.
[56:24.000 --> 56:29.000]  And there was marketing pre 9 11 getting us ready to give up our rights and a new way of life.
[56:29.000 --> 56:32.000]  There was marketing on the anthrax issue.
[56:32.000 --> 56:36.000]  I mean, they think you're so dumb folks, they do marketing campaigns in front of you.
[56:36.000 --> 56:41.000]  And they've got marketing campaigns about bio weapon releases that are going to happen.
[56:41.000 --> 56:43.000]  And that the world will never be the same.
[56:43.000 --> 56:48.000]  They've got to take all our rights away once this happens and the world government will save you from the bio attack.
[56:48.000 --> 56:55.000]  But that it's also good that there's going to be a bio attack and that we're going to all die because it's for the earth.
[56:55.000 --> 56:59.000]  And we're going to cover that coming up in the next hour.
[56:59.000 --> 57:01.000]  There's an article at infowars.com.
[57:01.000 --> 57:07.000]  There's all these real global statements about wanting to release a bio weapon to kill everybody as I've been covering the last few weeks.
[57:07.000 --> 57:15.000]  But then the onion comes out with satire to make fun of it so that now when we talk about it, yuppies think it's cute and make a joke out of it and say you heard that in the onion.
[57:15.000 --> 57:17.000]  So Aaron Dykes will be in studio with us.
[57:17.000 --> 57:25.000]  I want to play a TV piece that's being shown to British school children where they teach everybody you're not going to have a good standard of living anymore.
[57:25.000 --> 57:28.000]  To understand why they want to shut our economies down worldwide.
[57:28.000 --> 57:30.000]  And I haven't even gotten into the news.
[57:30.000 --> 57:35.000]  And I'm not even sure if I'm going to take calls on this Sunday edition because I've got so much I want to talk about.
[57:35.000 --> 57:39.000]  I haven't even gotten into the crimes of the New World Order yet and their master plan.
[57:39.000 --> 57:47.000]  But more and more the news is secondary to who is in control. Certified psychopathic control freaks that want you dead.
[58:09.000 --> 58:17.000]  If you ever think your future would feel this out of control, the fact is in all this craziness, there's only one thing you can control.
[58:17.000 --> 58:20.000]  Your greatest dependency, your food supply.
[58:20.000 --> 58:24.000]  Make 2012 the year you take control by getting prepared.
[58:24.000 --> 58:29.000]  EatFoodsDirect introduces the best way to build your food supply in the 21st century.
[58:29.000 --> 58:32.000]  Get a 21 day supply of food free with purchase.

[58:46.000 --> 58:50.000]  Remember, you can bet your life on EatFoods Direct.
[58:50.000 --> 58:52.000]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[58:52.000 --> 58:57.000]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity and recognized risk.
[58:57.000 --> 58:59.000]  Saving means to make money.
[58:59.000 --> 59:06.000]  The Calben Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated
[59:06.000 --> 59:09.000]  and twice as good as what you're using now.
[59:09.000 --> 59:16.000]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[59:16.000 --> 59:24.000]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[59:24.000 --> 59:29.000]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[59:29.000 --> 59:34.000]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091
[59:34.000 --> 59:38.000]  or see Calben on the Web at 5starsoap.com.
[59:38.000 --> 59:43.000]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091
[59:43.000 --> 59:46.000]  or see Calben on the Web at 5starsoap.com.
[59:51.000 --> 59:54.000]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[59:54.000 --> 59:58.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[59:58.000 --> 1:00:01.000]  Network.
[1:00:01.000 --> 1:00:08.000]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the Information War continues.
[1:00:08.000 --> 1:00:12.000]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:23.000]  The ruling class in every culture has always seen the commoners as animals and scum
[1:00:23.000 --> 1:00:29.000]  except in a few enlightened and powered societies that had huge renaissance
[1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:32.000]  when they tried to build up the average person.
[1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:41.000]  And so this studying and system of tricking your population, manipulating,
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:51.000]  it's been developed for five, six thousand years to a science, but now it's entered its golden age.
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:01:00.000]  And the great contest for human destiny in our future is being played out right now.
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:10.000]  All of you listening, your food, your water, has been poisoned, been manipulated.
[1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:13.000]  It's very hard to avoid the genetically modified organisms.
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:20.000]  They can have three generations of rats in just a year
[1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:24.000]  and find that by the third generation of rats, guinea pigs and other mammals,
[1:01:24.000 --> 1:01:30.000]  they have near total sterilization just being fed one type of GMO corn or wheat.
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  And it's the same in every study because it's not an accident, it's not a side effect.
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:42.000]  You're told that these different crops have a trait you're buying
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:46.000]  and then it turns out in most of the studies they don't even increase yields like they say.
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:53.000]  But really you're being given the real trait, the Trojan horse trait.
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:59.000]  And we've all accepted these big Trojan horses into our lives because they're so small.
[1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:03.000]  They're hidden inside the food, the water that looks good, it smells good.
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:10.000]  That's how you poison coyotes.
[1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:16.000]  If you don't care about killing other wildlife, you just poison a pond they're getting water out of.
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  Make sure it's a poison that takes a few days to kill them.
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  They'll all drink it. They'll die.
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:24.000]  Other coyotes will go back and drink out of it. They won't know why they're dying.
[1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:26.000]  And we're treated like animals.
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:29.000]  But humanity is supposed to be different.
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  We've certainly visited at least the edge of the stars.
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:39.000]  We've created music like Beethoven and incredible art.
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  I'm a fan of humanity. I love humanity.
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:49.000]  And the globalists, because they've done horrible things to their own kind, have made excuses.
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:55.000]  The mind often finds a way to follow what the heart wants.
[1:02:55.000 --> 1:02:58.000]  And the globalists are truly wicked in their hearts.
[1:02:58.000 --> 1:03:07.000]  And so they build worlds as self-fulfilling prophecies out of what they already believe and what they want to do.
[1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:10.000]  And so our life expectancy is dropping.
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:16.000]  We have the highest rates of cancer, diabetes, obesity, every other neurological infirmity.
[1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:19.000]  Here in the United States, we're the beta test.
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:22.000]  England follows the second as the next beta test.
[1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:27.000]  And we're now only probably 25 years into just a few crops being GMO.
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  Now they're coming out with hundreds and hundreds.
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:33.000]  So we're about one generation on average humans replicate every 20 years.
[1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:37.000]  They'll take another 40 to be to that three-generation mark.
[1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:41.000]  And by then, we'll be like the guinea pigs.
[1:03:41.000 --> 1:03:46.000]  Menly retarded, hair growing out of our mouths, almost completely sterile.
[1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  Bizarre deformities that happened after they're born, which many scientists thought wasn't even possible.
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:59.000]  Non-cancerous deformities.
[1:03:59.000 --> 1:04:02.000]  Just hell has been released.
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:04.000]  I'm walking dead. You're walking dead.
[1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:08.000]  Even if you try to protect your children, they're walking dead.
[1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:11.000]  And I'm here even though I'll probably be shut down.
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:12.000]  Who knows when?
[1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:13.000]  Could be soon.
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:15.000]  Things are getting really dark.
[1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:19.000]  Or we could continue on for a long time if we backed the globalist off and maybe reverse it.
[1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  But I want you to remember that you saw this and heard this down the road.
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:30.000]  They've already got internet technologies to erase my voice off the entire internet in a matter of hours
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  with the Kaza type systems that they have once everything's on cloud databases.
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:39.000]  So you're going to have to write down what I said. You're going to have to hide it.
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:47.000]  Because if we don't stop them at this juncture, they'll have excuses.
[1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  They'll claim, oh, we had toxic waste, so that caused everyone to be sterile.
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:57.000]  No, you were sterilized by the people that are in those high-tech government reservations.
[1:04:57.000 --> 1:04:59.000]  I'm talking to folks, of course, in the year 2035.
[1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:06.000]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[1:05:06.000 --> 1:05:11.000]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[1:05:11.000 --> 1:05:14.000]  It's true, seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country.
[1:05:14.000 --> 1:05:16.000]  And it's possible that could even happen again.
[1:05:16.000 --> 1:05:21.000]  So our friends at Solutions From Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:24.000]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[1:05:24.000 --> 1:05:29.000]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:33.000]  And here's the best part. These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[1:05:33.000 --> 1:05:37.000]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full-acre crisis garden.
[1:05:37.000 --> 1:05:40.000]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[1:05:40.000 --> 1:05:42.000]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:47.000]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[1:05:47.000 --> 1:05:51.000]  That's 877-327-0365.
[1:05:51.000 --> 1:05:56.000]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[1:05:56.000 --> 1:06:22.000]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[1:06:26.000 --> 1:06:39.000]  The entire architecture of the Internet, which itself is a control and communication system
[1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:48.000]  into all technological devices, has been engineered to track and trace and control the population.
[1:06:48.000 --> 1:06:56.000]  It is now phasing into the control grid it was always designed to be by eugenicists,
[1:06:56.000 --> 1:07:00.000]  those that wish for total tyranny, within DARPA.
[1:07:00.000 --> 1:07:04.000]  There is global standardization of every system on record.
[1:07:04.000 --> 1:07:10.000]  And today we're getting into the architecture of the New World Order, part of a series of reports I'll continue to do.
[1:07:10.000 --> 1:07:15.000]  I had a brainstorm before the broadcast began today.
[1:07:15.000 --> 1:07:21.000]  And I was just thinking about all the incredible crimes that are committed against this.
[1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:24.000]  And I only wrote 28. You guys can come up with hundreds more.
[1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:27.000]  We're going to do big reports on it in the future.
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:32.000]  By the way, I am going to be speaking in Dallas, Texas, coming up on the 19th in Orlando, Florida,
[1:07:32.000 --> 1:07:38.000]  for an affiliate on the 26th of next month.
[1:07:38.000 --> 1:07:42.000]  And you can go to infowars.com and find banners that link to that.
[1:07:42.000 --> 1:07:45.000]  I'm going to kick an events page up as well.
[1:07:45.000 --> 1:07:48.000]  It's a beta test for going and visiting more affiliates in the future.
[1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:53.000]  How do you visit 100 plus affiliates? We'll try.
[1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:56.000]  But these crimes of dumbing down the population by design,
[1:07:56.000 --> 1:08:00.000]  that's in Department of Education documents that are in the book, Deliberate Dumbing Down,
[1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:06.000]  Charlotte Isherby, Scullinbone's Family, number two, Department of Education, exposing it all.
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:11.000]  Destroying the language on record, reducing it, changing it, changing what words mean.
[1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:16.000]  There's big studies out on how the language, people today, 200 years ago,
[1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:20.000]  couldn't even communicate with our colonial ancestors.
[1:08:20.000 --> 1:08:23.000]  I mean, we're just totally dumbed down, myself included.
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:27.000]  They're constructing a parasitic predatory scientific kill grid.
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:30.000]  That's what this whole Neural Order system's for.
[1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:33.000]  And look at all the crimes they've committed, all the lies.
[1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:36.000]  They're attacking real culture wherever it comes from.
[1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:44.000]  Tribal, family-oriented, religious, they want you to accept their plastic, globalist culture
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:53.000]  that they can just download a new politically correct system into you the next week whenever they want.
[1:08:53.000 --> 1:08:54.000]  The bio weapons.
[1:08:54.000 --> 1:08:56.000]  I mean, all these governments admittedly,
[1:08:56.000 --> 1:09:01.000]  corporations creating hundreds and hundreds of super bio weapons, the name of fighting bio weapons,
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:05.000]  that are specifically tailored to kill over 90% of the humans they come in contact with.
[1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:09.000]  While the globalists talk all day about getting rid of the population,
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:14.000]  the GMOs on record sterilizing every mammal species they're fed to,
[1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:20.000]  reducing fertility first generation, massively reducing second, near pure sterility by the third.
[1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:22.000]  Guinea pig rat studies, look it up, it's nightmare.
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:23.000]  You're being fed this.
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:30.000]  Bugs cannot eat the GMO corn that has the pesticide that grows in it, a pharmacological crop.
[1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:35.000]  I mean, folks, there is a holocaust going on, but it's not Nazi tanks and Blitzkriegs
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  and ditches shooting people in the back of the head while they are doing that in Africa.
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:40.000]  I'm going to get to that in a moment.
[1:09:40.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  It's against everybody.
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:47.000]  While the whole time, ignoring the real environmental problems and covering it up,
[1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:49.000]  listing carbon dioxide is the crime.
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:55.000]  Again, they're masters at controlling movements with a distraction that they use to then control everybody
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:10:01.000]  while engaging environmental holocaust that make your head spin.
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:04.000]  The fluoridation of the water, the cancer it causes on record.
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:06.000]  The deadly vaccines, their own and inserts admitting it.
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:12.000]  All of this, government drug dealing, fast and furious, caught blaming the Second Amendment as a false flag.
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:15.000]  The NDAA saying no bill of rights, no constitution, we can secretly arrest you.
[1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:19.000]  The torture, constantly caught lying, the TSA lies.
[1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:22.000]  The ultra rich exempt from the taxes because they write the laws,
[1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  then they point to the blue collar folks and say,
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:30.000]  that guy who's rich making 200,000 a year raises taxes because they get paid most of that money
[1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:32.000]  in corporate welfare and banker bailouts.
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:35.000]  The ultra rich want to rob the middle class through taxes
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:38.000]  and the poor people are unsophisticated and don't understand that.
[1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:39.000]  Actually, they do.
[1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:41.000]  Most of them actually aren't for raising taxes.
[1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:42.000]  I've seen national polls.
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  They've got it when Warren Buffett saying, I want to pay more.
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:46.000]  Really?
[1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:47.000]  Well, just pay it.
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:52.000]  Oh, you're so cold-blooded, you got Obama to shut down the pipeline bringing the U.S. oil,
[1:10:52.000 --> 1:10:54.000]  so it won't be dependent on the Middle East,
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  so you can ship it on trains, Bloomberg reports, to the West Coast and then to ships to China.
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:03.000]  Oh, because you care about us.
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:08.000]  I mean, these are cold-blooded scum who fund PR.
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:12.000]  Turns out Warren Buffett and Bill Gates are funding ABC News.
[1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:15.000]  That's why every time I turn it on, it's how great they are and how much they love you.
[1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:18.000]  And if they'll just raise taxes, they'll kiss you on the head.
[1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:21.000]  I mean, these are monsters.
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:25.000]  Now, I want to bring Aaron Dykes in here after this next break that's coming up,
[1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:27.000]  but I wanted to get to this now.
[1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:29.000]  There's more than 10 of these that I've seen.
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  These were produced in association with the British government and foundations.
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:38.000]  You can just type in Plandopolis and you can go to their website.
[1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:42.000]  You can watch them on YouTube and they show this to kids in Britain.
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:44.000]  Now, you'd think this is a joke.
[1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:45.000]  This is not a joke.
[1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:47.000]  Similar stuff is shown in U.S. classrooms.
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:50.000]  I've got Time Magazine from kids a decade ago saying,
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:52.000]  your parents aren't trendy.
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:53.000]  We wrote an article about it.
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:54.000]  Pull it up on Infowars.com.
[1:11:54.000 --> 1:11:56.000]  Your parents aren't trendy.
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  They don't know to get a microchip in their bodies.
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:00.000]  Cool.
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:02.000]  They belong to the old generation that isn't with it.
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:04.000]  I mean, I've read this on air repeatedly.
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:06.000]  You can pull it up.
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:11.000]  This is given free in the schools to kids telling them your parents are bad and dumb.
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:14.000]  What did Al Gore get recorded repeatedly telling school kids in these auditoriums?
[1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:16.000]  Your parents don't know.
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:20.000]  You go home and tell them, pay more taxes because of the evil carbon.
[1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  They have video games in public schools teaching them carbon monsters are going to get them.
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:28.000]  I've talked to parents who have their kids in private and public school and they say
[1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:32.000]  they'll drive by a housing development and cry saying the earth is dying.
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:36.000]  They're teaching them to hate themselves and not even for the environment,
[1:12:36.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  but so they'll just do whatever the programmers tell them.
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:41.000]  It's the new religion and the globalists admit that.
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:42.000]  But this isn't a joke.
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:47.000]  See, for those of you that are older and are under the old programming, this sounds extreme.
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  To the young, they're being shown this.
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:51.000]  It's a woman in charge.
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:52.000]  The man's a piece of garbage.
[1:12:52.000 --> 1:12:55.000]  That's a globalist model CIA, Miss Magazine funded.
[1:12:55.000 --> 1:12:59.000]  So the women are working so the kids are raised by the state.
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:02.000]  And they talk about how great this planned society is.
[1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:06.000]  Let's just play a few minutes of what's shown to British school children.
[1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:09.000]  And again, folks, there's thousands of these statements about post-industrial world.
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:11.000]  They're going to shut everything off on purpose.
[1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:14.000]  Citi, sing around, jack up your taxes for the earth.
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:16.000]  Here it is.
[1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  Hi, I'm so glad you're on time.
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:22.000]  I'm V.
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:26.000]  I'm looking forward to showing you around Plandopolis today.
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:28.000]  My husband works from home.
[1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:32.000]  He's a virtual engineer working in one of the city's desalination plants.
[1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:35.000]  He controls the robots who do all the important maintenance.
[1:13:35.000 --> 1:13:38.000]  I think he basically plays computer games for a living.
[1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:41.000]  Are you ready to go?
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:44.000]  Have you got your calorie card open on your smartphone?
[1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:47.000]  I registered your visit at Slick Travel Corp the other day.
[1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:49.000]  Good plus.
[1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  By the way, this came out a year ago.
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:53.000]  They now are teaching in the U.S. and England.
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:59.000]  Just type in everyone to be given calorie cards, carbon tax ration cards.
[1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:01.000]  The EU's trying to pass it as law.
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:04.000]  They've passed a law phased in next year.
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:08.000]  But by 2020 by law, no families are allowed to live in a home alone.
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:12.000]  All new homes, including ones you're allowed to buy, are single.
[1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:15.000]  No more single parent or family dwelling.
[1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:17.000]  They're in communal buildings.
[1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:18.000]  That's now law.
[1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:20.000]  I mean, this is cult takeover.
[1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:21.000]  Let's continue.
[1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:22.000]  Here it is.
[1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:25.000]  It makes so much sense, doesn't it?
[1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:28.000]  Switch off brain and go to work.
[1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:32.000]  With this many people around, I'm glad there's a mega computer in charge.
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:34.000]  Stop right there.
[1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:39.000]  That's pushed by all these little globalist groups that pose as grassroots organizations
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:42.000]  but get written up in the New York Times about how great they are,
[1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:45.000]  all these little videos on the Internet about a big computer will run it
[1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:47.000]  and divide everything up evenly.
[1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:49.000]  That's targeting the dumbest of people.
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:51.000]  Who programs the computer?
[1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:54.000]  What if you don't want to go live in a big plastic city?
[1:14:54.000 --> 1:14:55.000]  Let's continue.
[1:14:55.000 --> 1:14:56.000]  Here it is.
[1:14:56.000 --> 1:14:59.000]  Our kids were allocated to school quite near my practice
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:02.000]  so I can drop them off from the way it saves on my calorie ration.
[1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:05.000]  Well, it won't be long until the little darlings get their career announcements.
[1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:07.000]  They've been working so hard.
[1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:10.000]  That's what Bill Gates has always pushed, pre-testing.
[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:12.000]  They call it school choice.
[1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:17.000]  No, no, these are corporate schools that are actually taxpayer funded partially,
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:20.000]  which you think, oh, I'm getting out of the gang member schools,
[1:15:20.000 --> 1:15:22.000]  then you're sent to the Bill and Melinda Gates brainwashing school.
[1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:25.000]  They fund them all over the country with your tax money.
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:27.000]  It's all tax-free for them.
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:28.000]  Continue.
[1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:30.000]  I'm sure they'll get something good.
[1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:34.000]  Not often is anything wrong with fixing carbon scrubbers for a living or anything.
[1:15:34.000 --> 1:15:36.000]  Are you hungry?
[1:15:36.000 --> 1:15:38.000]  Let's pop to the market as we pass.
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:42.000]  Right, what's on the menu this month?
[1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:45.000]  No, not meat. It's not your birthday.
[1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:51.000]  The Global Food Council are doing a really good job of keeping food production going.
[1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:52.000]  Let's stop there.
[1:15:52.000 --> 1:15:54.000]  They've actually announced the Global Food Council.
[1:15:54.000 --> 1:15:56.000]  It'll decide if you can even have a garden.
[1:15:56.000 --> 1:15:58.000]  We'll be right back. Total UN takeover of everything.
[1:15:58.000 --> 1:16:00.000]  Stay with us here in Dyches.
[1:16:00.000 --> 1:16:05.000]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lunges Generator infuses the respiratory system
[1:16:05.000 --> 1:16:08.000]  with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions,
[1:16:08.000 --> 1:16:11.000]  yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lunges System
[1:16:11.000 --> 1:16:16.000]  and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[1:16:16.000 --> 1:16:21.000]  My name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lunges Generator.
[1:16:21.000 --> 1:16:26.000]  Not only does the Silver Lunges System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions,
[1:16:26.000 --> 1:16:30.000]  it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed
[1:16:30.000 --> 1:16:34.000]  to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[1:16:34.000 --> 1:16:42.000]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[1:16:42.000 --> 1:16:46.000]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lunges System
[1:16:46.000 --> 1:16:52.000]  at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lunges System works.
[1:16:52.000 --> 1:16:56.000]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.

[1:35:24.000 --> 1:35:27.880]  Tennessee, live Monday through Friday.
[1:35:27.880 --> 1:35:29.160]  It's just some of our great affiliates.
[1:35:29.160 --> 1:35:30.800]  We're getting so many new ones.
[1:35:30.800 --> 1:35:34.440]  You know, Aaron, that's what's exciting is that
[1:35:35.600 --> 1:35:37.760]  people actually have taken me up on looking into
[1:35:37.760 --> 1:35:40.280]  what I've said for a lot of years.
[1:35:40.280 --> 1:35:41.840]  Some people will look it up and go, wow,
[1:35:41.840 --> 1:35:43.760]  this guy's telling the truth that most people said,
[1:35:43.760 --> 1:35:45.240]  okay, part of what he's saying is true,
[1:35:45.240 --> 1:35:46.360]  but it can't be that bad.
[1:35:46.360 --> 1:35:48.040]  Now that so much of this stuff has happened,
[1:35:48.040 --> 1:35:50.400]  now most people are looking into what I've said
[1:35:50.400 --> 1:35:53.240]  and they're finding out it's worse than I'm saying, Aaron.
[1:35:53.240 --> 1:35:55.360]  That's been personally very fulfilling for me.
[1:35:55.360 --> 1:35:57.320]  Even when I know you're not making something up,
[1:35:57.320 --> 1:36:00.320]  I look it up anyway because I always learn new things
[1:36:00.320 --> 1:36:02.520]  and I have this enriched like deep knowledge
[1:36:02.520 --> 1:36:03.520]  of what you're talking about.
[1:36:03.520 --> 1:36:05.040]  And I know the whole background,
[1:36:05.040 --> 1:36:06.200]  a lot of the players involved.
[1:36:06.200 --> 1:36:09.000]  And when you start seeing the same globalist players
[1:36:09.000 --> 1:36:12.960]  and a chain of continuity pushing this agenda over centuries,
[1:36:12.960 --> 1:36:14.840]  that's when it really gets creepy.
[1:36:14.840 --> 1:36:17.120]  I mean, that's when we start to really get close to the target.
[1:36:17.120 --> 1:36:18.720]  And people ask if they'll spike.
[1:36:18.720 --> 1:36:19.560]  If this is a key point,
[1:36:19.560 --> 1:36:20.640]  I want folks to listen carefully
[1:36:20.640 --> 1:36:23.160]  and then I want your view on this, Aaron.
[1:36:23.160 --> 1:36:24.320]  Because I've thought a lot about this.
[1:36:24.320 --> 1:36:26.760]  The most common question I get is,
[1:36:26.760 --> 1:36:28.560]  why are you still alive?
[1:36:28.560 --> 1:36:31.640]  Well, in the early days, they tried to hire me.
[1:36:31.640 --> 1:36:34.920]  Oh, hey, come work for us, we'll make you a star.
[1:36:34.920 --> 1:36:37.000]  And then I've been beat up and told to shut up
[1:36:37.000 --> 1:36:39.320]  and I've had dirty tricks and things happen.
[1:36:39.320 --> 1:36:42.120]  But they've assessed the fact that I'm 110% committed
[1:36:42.120 --> 1:36:43.840]  because I've seen what's going on.
[1:36:43.840 --> 1:36:47.160]  I mean, do you see the real world folks, not the matrix,
[1:36:47.160 --> 1:36:49.480]  but the real architecture of this,
[1:36:49.480 --> 1:36:52.760]  not just this thin level we're kept in of this info
[1:36:52.760 --> 1:36:54.640]  and false information?
[1:36:54.640 --> 1:36:56.640]  It's not hard to not sell out.
[1:36:56.640 --> 1:37:00.120]  I mean, you're not, you can't sell out.
[1:37:01.120 --> 1:37:03.360]  This is the most sickening, hyper-dominant,
[1:37:03.360 --> 1:37:06.000]  out-of-control scientist that developed the system.
[1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:09.000]  It's so anti-human, so evil, so ugly,
[1:37:09.000 --> 1:37:12.440]  goes so against everything in my soul and heart
[1:37:12.440 --> 1:37:13.920]  that it's not even debatable.
[1:37:14.800 --> 1:37:16.200]  It's not even a question.
[1:37:17.160 --> 1:37:20.240]  And the values of being powerful or cool
[1:37:20.240 --> 1:37:23.360]  or all the petty animal level stuff
[1:37:23.360 --> 1:37:25.040]  that they used to program us with,
[1:37:25.040 --> 1:37:28.040]  when you actually become a conscious, awake human,
[1:37:28.040 --> 1:37:29.080]  they would call it illuminated,
[1:37:29.080 --> 1:37:31.440]  but that's just being a normal human, just being normal.
[1:37:31.440 --> 1:37:33.800]  The globalists call it illuminated that they're evil
[1:37:33.800 --> 1:37:36.200]  and understand all this and are conscious.
[1:37:36.200 --> 1:37:37.040]  You understand?
[1:37:37.040 --> 1:37:41.000]  That illumination is a false version of just being conscious.
[1:37:41.000 --> 1:37:43.920]  Once you're actually conscious and see this
[1:37:43.920 --> 1:37:46.000]  and see what the dark workers are doing,
[1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:50.960]  sell out and jump in a pack of black devils?
[1:37:50.960 --> 1:37:52.720]  Jump right into hell's mouth?
[1:37:52.720 --> 1:37:53.720]  No, thank you.
[1:37:53.720 --> 1:37:56.440]  Okay, you gonna kill me, set me up, destroy my name?
[1:37:56.440 --> 1:37:57.640]  Go right ahead.
[1:37:59.160 --> 1:38:02.000]  I don't wanna be at a table with you.
[1:38:02.000 --> 1:38:05.640]  Just like I don't wanna hang out in my basement
[1:38:05.640 --> 1:38:06.560]  with a dead horse.
[1:38:06.560 --> 1:38:09.360]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[1:38:09.360 --> 1:38:12.680]  And you see how in bondage people are through trendiness
[1:38:12.680 --> 1:38:15.320]  and how they'll do anything of it stylish and cool
[1:38:15.320 --> 1:38:16.920]  and just totally pack driven.
[1:38:16.920 --> 1:38:18.560]  It's so scary.
[1:38:18.560 --> 1:38:20.200]  The globalists haven't killed me
[1:38:20.200 --> 1:38:23.440]  because we're so on target with what we're covering
[1:38:23.440 --> 1:38:26.680]  that they don't want to create a martyr.
[1:38:26.680 --> 1:38:28.680]  So they've tried to assassinate my character instead
[1:38:28.680 --> 1:38:31.400]  and who I am from below and above,
[1:38:31.400 --> 1:38:36.400]  from grassroots staged events and domino chain reaction,
[1:38:37.560 --> 1:38:39.520]  hysteria, attempts on us.
[1:38:39.520 --> 1:38:41.320]  Those haven't worked.
[1:38:41.320 --> 1:38:43.760]  The upper attacks haven't worked as well
[1:38:43.760 --> 1:38:44.960]  because I've been conscious of it.
[1:38:44.960 --> 1:38:46.720]  Attacks are meant to freak you out
[1:38:46.720 --> 1:38:48.640]  and get you all my gosh and being attacked.
[1:38:48.640 --> 1:38:49.720]  I better defend myself.
[1:38:49.720 --> 1:38:50.960]  Hey, I'm just putting out the info.
[1:38:50.960 --> 1:38:52.040]  Destroy me.
[1:38:52.040 --> 1:38:53.840]  The info is there at the end of it.
[1:38:53.840 --> 1:38:57.800]  You see, it's that power of the info already went out.
[1:38:57.800 --> 1:38:59.200]  Destroy me.
[1:38:59.200 --> 1:39:00.600]  I don't wanna be destroyed.
[1:39:00.600 --> 1:39:02.720]  I love life so much, I'm willing to give it up.
[1:39:02.720 --> 1:39:04.560]  Destroy my name, destroy it all.
[1:39:04.560 --> 1:39:06.160]  This message has to go out.
[1:39:06.160 --> 1:39:08.400]  The globalists know I see them.
[1:39:08.400 --> 1:39:09.520]  You see, that's the other issue.
[1:39:09.520 --> 1:39:10.800]  They know I'm looking around at them.
[1:39:10.800 --> 1:39:12.360]  They know I got it.
[1:39:12.360 --> 1:39:15.080]  I got it, in fact, more than many of them do.
[1:39:15.080 --> 1:39:16.800]  So that's why I've been told from very high levels
[1:39:16.800 --> 1:39:18.240]  to actually listen to the show
[1:39:18.240 --> 1:39:22.120]  because in a way, they're so decadent
[1:39:22.120 --> 1:39:23.520]  and so sold out to everything.
[1:39:23.520 --> 1:39:26.280]  It's kind of thrilling to hear somebody talk about them
[1:39:26.280 --> 1:39:27.280]  from the other perspective.
[1:39:27.280 --> 1:39:30.240]  I'm almost like Howard Cosell calling the game.
[1:39:30.240 --> 1:39:32.680]  They're so sick of the fake reality they give the public.
[1:39:32.680 --> 1:39:34.320]  They know there's blowback on them.
[1:39:34.320 --> 1:39:36.120]  They know it's actually hurting them as well.
[1:39:36.120 --> 1:39:40.040]  Some globalists clearly believe that I'm also,
[1:39:40.040 --> 1:39:44.080]  in a way, even helping them understand their plan
[1:39:44.080 --> 1:39:47.840]  a little bit better because each of us is a stage,
[1:39:47.840 --> 1:39:52.080]  each of us is a player upon the stage.
[1:39:52.080 --> 1:39:54.520]  The whole world is a stage to quote Shakespeare.
[1:39:54.520 --> 1:39:59.520]  But what I'm getting at here is that obviously
[1:39:59.560 --> 1:40:01.120]  it's like a moth to flame.
[1:40:01.120 --> 1:40:03.600]  The psychopaths like to hear about themselves.
[1:40:03.600 --> 1:40:05.680]  The psychopaths like to call the police station and say,
[1:40:05.680 --> 1:40:07.560]  I'm gonna kill another one tonight.
[1:40:07.560 --> 1:40:08.760]  There's nothing you're gonna do.
[1:40:08.760 --> 1:40:09.920]  They get more and more reckless.
[1:40:09.920 --> 1:40:11.880]  They wanna be caught subconsciously.
[1:40:11.880 --> 1:40:14.960]  But in a statistical cold-blooded analysis,
[1:40:14.960 --> 1:40:16.480]  they haven't killed me physically
[1:40:16.480 --> 1:40:19.280]  because it could exclamation point, highlight,
[1:40:19.280 --> 1:40:23.120]  underline, shout out, megaphone, everything I've said.
[1:40:25.680 --> 1:40:29.000]  But again, I've answered that question for you.
[1:40:29.000 --> 1:40:31.080]  I just think it's important for you to understand
[1:40:31.080 --> 1:40:33.880]  they don't wanna endanger their overall program
[1:40:33.880 --> 1:40:36.520]  because it's all based on the false reality.
[1:40:36.520 --> 1:40:38.600]  It's all based on them making things more and more
[1:40:38.600 --> 1:40:41.160]  about fantasy, phasing out reality,
[1:40:41.160 --> 1:40:44.880]  phasing out our true republic, phasing out our culture,
[1:40:44.880 --> 1:40:48.000]  destroying everything, making people just these emotional,
[1:40:48.000 --> 1:40:52.000]  arrested development, adults that are like children,
[1:40:52.000 --> 1:40:57.000]  unconscious, unaware, basically in the dark.
[1:40:57.520 --> 1:41:00.400]  And so, the globalists basically are masters
[1:41:00.400 --> 1:41:04.280]  at mass manipulation and hoaxes and false reports
[1:41:04.280 --> 1:41:06.240]  and to use our own goodness against us
[1:41:06.240 --> 1:41:09.360]  to buy into their frauds,
[1:41:09.360 --> 1:41:14.360]  to buy into their fake party atmospheres they create.
[1:41:14.720 --> 1:41:16.920]  And so, they're actually quite weak.
[1:41:16.920 --> 1:41:19.080]  They're only able to operate by playing
[1:41:19.080 --> 1:41:20.760]  like an instrument to public.
[1:41:20.760 --> 1:41:22.000]  But the moment you're conscious,
[1:41:22.000 --> 1:41:23.640]  they can't do that anymore.
[1:41:23.640 --> 1:41:25.600]  And so, that's why.
[1:41:25.600 --> 1:41:27.720]  They have to sell you that torture is good
[1:41:27.720 --> 1:41:29.760]  and secret arrest and surveillance is good.
[1:41:29.760 --> 1:41:31.400]  They've always had to hide that now
[1:41:31.400 --> 1:41:33.320]  because we've exposed it and others have.
[1:41:33.320 --> 1:41:35.160]  They're having to try to go, well, okay,
[1:41:35.160 --> 1:41:37.400]  it's okay to have the TSA grab your daughter's crotch
[1:41:37.400 --> 1:41:38.680]  or your wife's breast.
[1:41:38.680 --> 1:41:40.920]  It's okay to have us put fluoride in the water.
[1:41:40.920 --> 1:41:43.080]  It's okay, we did put on the insert,
[1:41:43.080 --> 1:41:44.440]  the vaccine can brain damage you.
[1:41:44.440 --> 1:41:45.600]  But still, it's good for you.
[1:41:45.600 --> 1:41:48.680]  Don't read the insert, don't look at the fine print.
[1:41:48.680 --> 1:41:51.720]  You see, Aaron, I'm ranting here,
[1:41:51.720 --> 1:41:53.720]  but do you have any perspectives on what I've said?
[1:41:53.720 --> 1:41:55.080]  Yeah, in addition to what you're saying,
[1:41:55.080 --> 1:41:57.000]  I think it has to do with the pace of information.
[1:41:57.000 --> 1:41:58.400]  I mean, what's the real reason
[1:41:58.400 --> 1:42:01.160]  why the library of Alexandria got destroyed?
[1:42:01.160 --> 1:42:03.680]  It killed a whole culture of information.
[1:42:03.680 --> 1:42:05.600]  And so I think in a decade,
[1:42:05.600 --> 1:42:07.600]  if they succeed in stopping the internet,
[1:42:07.600 --> 1:42:09.320]  that's when you might be physically in danger.
[1:42:09.320 --> 1:42:11.680]  Right now, the public knows what's going on
[1:42:11.680 --> 1:42:13.480]  and it would be a total backlash against them.
[1:42:13.480 --> 1:42:17.160]  It was easy in the 60s when one hand controlled
[1:42:17.160 --> 1:42:19.560]  the only three television networks
[1:42:19.560 --> 1:42:21.720]  to kill the Kennedy brothers and Martin Luther King
[1:42:21.720 --> 1:42:23.280]  and spend it and lie about it.
[1:42:23.280 --> 1:42:24.600]  And they knew they'd basically get.
[1:42:24.600 --> 1:42:27.480]  And now it's come out, the CIA was there, gunman.
[1:42:27.480 --> 1:42:31.280]  The LA police said that he was shot from behind.
[1:42:31.280 --> 1:42:32.120]  It was the government.
[1:42:32.120 --> 1:42:32.960]  And that's on record.
[1:42:32.960 --> 1:42:33.800]  Go ahead.
[1:42:33.800 --> 1:42:36.600]  When you get killed 10 minutes after a crucial election
[1:42:36.600 --> 1:42:39.160]  and your brother was murdered for related reasons,
[1:42:39.160 --> 1:42:41.560]  it's not really, it doesn't take brain science.
[1:42:41.560 --> 1:42:42.400]  Exactly.
[1:42:42.400 --> 1:42:46.360]  There is that psychic warfare, that psychological warfare,
[1:42:46.360 --> 1:42:49.480]  that psychological compulsion built in
[1:42:49.480 --> 1:42:51.120]  that when you hear about any corruption,
[1:42:51.120 --> 1:42:52.800]  you call it a conspiracy theory.
[1:42:52.800 --> 1:42:53.640]  Stay there.
[1:42:53.640 --> 1:42:54.840]  I wanna hear more from you, Aaron, on the other side.
[1:42:54.840 --> 1:42:57.160]  I'm gonna hit a smattering of news here,
[1:42:57.160 --> 1:42:58.200]  but we've really been just talking
[1:42:58.200 --> 1:43:00.200]  about the philosophy of the New World Order.
[1:43:00.200 --> 1:43:04.160]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny
[1:43:04.160 --> 1:43:05.880]  in the last century alone.
[1:43:05.880 --> 1:43:09.120]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[1:43:09.120 --> 1:43:11.480]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[1:43:11.480 --> 1:43:12.440]  that we're pulling the rug
[1:43:12.440 --> 1:43:14.400]  from underneath Americans at home.
[1:43:14.400 --> 1:43:18.400]  I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress.
[1:43:18.400 --> 1:43:20.280]  And they really are calling the shots.
[1:43:20.280 --> 1:43:23.160]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[1:43:23.160 --> 1:43:25.520]  as American citizens to pay attention.
[1:43:25.520 --> 1:43:28.800]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation,
[1:43:28.800 --> 1:43:31.000]  the criminal offshore cartel,
[1:43:31.000 --> 1:43:33.200]  held bent on destroying sovereignty,
[1:43:33.200 --> 1:43:35.640]  and on its ashes constructing world government.
[1:43:35.640 --> 1:43:38.000]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, the arsonists,
[1:43:38.000 --> 1:43:39.560]  they're asking for more matches.
[1:43:39.560 --> 1:43:41.960]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[1:43:41.960 --> 1:43:44.160]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[1:43:44.160 --> 1:43:46.400]  And right now in Washington, D.C.,
[1:43:46.400 --> 1:43:49.280]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[1:44:54.680 --> 1:44:57.280]  non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.

[1:45:20.120 --> 1:45:22.160]  would feel this out of control?
[1:45:22.160 --> 1:45:24.960]  The fact is, in all this craziness,

[1:46:05.560 --> 1:46:09.480]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[1:46:09.480 --> 1:46:11.880]  It really says that the state is God.
[1:46:11.880 --> 1:46:14.480]  The United States has now recognized globally
[1:46:14.480 --> 1:46:17.600]  as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[1:46:17.600 --> 1:46:20.000]  This film conclusively proves the existence
[1:46:20.000 --> 1:46:22.080]  of a secret network of FEMA camps,
[1:46:22.080 --> 1:46:24.240]  now being expanded nationwide.
[1:46:24.240 --> 1:46:26.640]  This documentary exposes how the continuity
[1:46:26.640 --> 1:46:28.320]  of government program has established
[1:46:28.320 --> 1:46:30.200]  an old powerful shadow state.
[1:46:30.200 --> 1:46:32.600]  Police State IV chronicles the sickening depths
[1:46:32.600 --> 1:46:34.360]  to which our republic has fallen.
[1:46:34.360 --> 1:46:36.840]  Prepare to enter the secret of world
[1:46:36.840 --> 1:46:38.640]  of emergency dictatorship.
[1:46:38.640 --> 1:46:41.720]  Body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies,
[1:46:41.720 --> 1:46:44.560]  staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[1:46:44.560 --> 1:46:45.800]  It's only the beginning
[1:46:45.800 --> 1:46:48.160]  of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[1:46:48.160 --> 1:46:50.080]  The police state isn't coming.
[1:46:50.080 --> 1:46:51.160]  It's here.

[1:47:05.040 --> 1:47:08.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[1:47:08.680 --> 1:47:09.520]  Network.
[1:47:10.560 --> 1:47:15.560]  What we've got here is failure to communicate.
[1:47:17.520 --> 1:47:21.600]  Some men you just can't reach.
[1:47:21.600 --> 1:47:24.240]  So you get what we had here last week,
[1:47:24.240 --> 1:47:26.880]  which is the way he wants.
[1:47:26.880 --> 1:47:28.200]  Well, he is.
[1:47:31.200 --> 1:47:34.200]  I don't like it anymore than you do.
[1:47:37.080 --> 1:47:39.640]  Waging war on corruption.
[1:47:39.640 --> 1:47:41.440]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:47:43.600 --> 1:47:46.200]  You know, I do a show on the weekend
[1:47:46.200 --> 1:47:50.480]  because I get so wound up
[1:47:50.480 --> 1:47:53.280]  in the past, started doing this show on the weekend,
[1:47:53.280 --> 1:47:55.720]  I guess five years ago, Time Flies.
[1:47:55.720 --> 1:48:00.040]  I get so wound up that I want to be back on air.
[1:48:00.040 --> 1:48:01.880]  And so I guess I should do more radio interviews.
[1:48:01.880 --> 1:48:03.160]  You know, we turned down most of the interviews
[1:48:03.160 --> 1:48:04.400]  unless it's a big syndicated show
[1:48:04.400 --> 1:48:06.240]  just because I'm so busy.
[1:48:06.240 --> 1:48:08.680]  And I guess it's when the weekend's happening
[1:48:08.680 --> 1:48:11.120]  that I want to do stuff because I've got time off
[1:48:11.120 --> 1:48:13.000]  and I'm thinking about everything.
[1:48:13.000 --> 1:48:15.760]  Sometimes I get a bit burnt out here at work,
[1:48:15.760 --> 1:48:17.480]  but I'm just begging your audience
[1:48:17.480 --> 1:48:19.600]  because I love you and I care about you.
[1:48:19.600 --> 1:48:24.200]  I mean, it's basic human compassion
[1:48:24.200 --> 1:48:26.800]  and understanding that if you care about somebody,
[1:48:26.800 --> 1:48:28.280]  they're gonna care about you
[1:48:28.280 --> 1:48:29.920]  and that builds a better world.
[1:48:31.800 --> 1:48:33.760]  I mean, if I didn't know a child
[1:48:33.760 --> 1:48:35.240]  and saw him walking out in front of a car,
[1:48:35.240 --> 1:48:37.760]  I'd run out and try to push him out of the way.
[1:48:38.680 --> 1:48:39.760]  Not because I'm a hero,
[1:48:39.760 --> 1:48:41.600]  but because I'm just a normal person.
[1:48:41.600 --> 1:48:44.400]  And they've taken our basic human instincts out of us.
[1:48:44.400 --> 1:48:46.400]  And I've told the story probably 20 times.
[1:48:46.400 --> 1:48:51.200]  I'll tell it again briefly. I know my son
[1:48:51.200 --> 1:48:52.400]  was only about a year and a half old.
[1:48:52.400 --> 1:48:55.400]  So I guess it had to be about nine years ago,
[1:48:55.400 --> 1:48:57.120]  eight and a half years ago.
[1:48:57.120 --> 1:49:01.040]  And I was at a little Madeline in North Austin restaurant.
[1:49:03.600 --> 1:49:07.200]  Went to the bathroom, we were halfway done eating dinner.
[1:49:07.200 --> 1:49:08.880]  And I came back, I heard yelling and screaming
[1:49:08.880 --> 1:49:09.720]  while I was in the bathroom.
[1:49:09.720 --> 1:49:12.080]  So I came out, all these people were standing around
[1:49:12.080 --> 1:49:14.640]  a woman turning purple, grabbing her throat, choking.
[1:49:14.640 --> 1:49:16.000]  They were all screaming like parrots,
[1:49:16.000 --> 1:49:18.840]  9-1-1, 9-1-1, like call my mommy government,
[1:49:18.840 --> 1:49:20.160]  call my daddy government.
[1:49:22.320 --> 1:49:24.160]  And I said, somebody do the Heimlich.
[1:49:24.160 --> 1:49:26.720]  It's like, be quiet, we'll get an ambulance.
[1:49:26.720 --> 1:49:30.720]  Just again, an idiot, the woman would be dead by then.
[1:49:30.720 --> 1:49:32.760]  Four and a half minutes, five minutes, you're dead.
[1:49:32.760 --> 1:49:36.240]  You know, I took CPR when I was on the swim team in Dallas.
[1:49:36.240 --> 1:49:38.800]  I'm just a basic course, I knew that, dead.
[1:49:39.960 --> 1:49:41.720]  I said, listen, I'm gonna give her the Heimlich.
[1:49:41.720 --> 1:49:44.800]  And now the woman's falling over on the table,
[1:49:44.800 --> 1:49:46.200]  purple, grabbing her throat.
[1:49:48.240 --> 1:49:51.340]  And I had to shove the people out of the way,
[1:49:53.280 --> 1:49:55.920]  bug my eyes out at some tough guy,
[1:49:55.920 --> 1:49:57.960]  because it was a crime to help somebody.
[1:49:57.960 --> 1:49:59.840]  You gotta call the police.
[1:49:59.840 --> 1:50:02.320]  I mean, I guess if I'm going to the bathroom next time,
[1:50:02.320 --> 1:50:04.200]  I'll call the police to come wipe my hind end.
[1:50:04.200 --> 1:50:06.160]  I mean, that's what this is coming down to
[1:50:06.160 --> 1:50:07.760]  in this sick culture.
[1:50:07.760 --> 1:50:09.960]  And it wasn't because I was a great guy.
[1:50:09.960 --> 1:50:11.960]  This woman was dying.
[1:50:11.960 --> 1:50:14.080]  And then I got her, did the Heimlich,
[1:50:14.080 --> 1:50:16.440]  she coughed up this big old piece of bread.
[1:50:16.440 --> 1:50:18.120]  Everybody's like, you're a hero, he's a hero.
[1:50:18.120 --> 1:50:19.600]  But they were acting weird.
[1:50:19.600 --> 1:50:21.400]  The woman's like, oh, my stomach.
[1:50:21.400 --> 1:50:22.520]  So I thought, oh, I'll get sued.
[1:50:22.520 --> 1:50:24.480]  I'm like, no, we're not finishing dinner, let's go.
[1:50:24.480 --> 1:50:26.480]  And they were all just like demonic and angry
[1:50:26.480 --> 1:50:27.720]  that someone had done something.
[1:50:27.720 --> 1:50:30.560]  They just wanted a black boot to stomp them in the head.
[1:50:30.560 --> 1:50:32.040]  They wanted to be run.
[1:50:32.040 --> 1:50:34.200]  Like those people in Nazi Germany who followed orders
[1:50:34.200 --> 1:50:36.280]  into those pits to be shot in the back of the head.
[1:50:36.280 --> 1:50:39.080]  I mean, it's like a demonic destroy me attitude.
[1:50:39.080 --> 1:50:41.360]  But I can't get mad at them
[1:50:41.360 --> 1:50:45.560]  because they've been programmed to not be normal.
[1:50:45.560 --> 1:50:48.200]  They've been programmed to be these creatures.
[1:50:49.720 --> 1:50:51.080]  But I'm gonna tell men something.
[1:50:51.080 --> 1:50:55.600]  You're not gonna find manhood watching football
[1:50:55.600 --> 1:50:57.840]  and cussing with your buddies.
[1:50:57.840 --> 1:50:59.720]  I'm just, you're not gonna find it there.
[1:50:59.720 --> 1:51:03.440]  Your food and your water is having compounds added
[1:51:03.440 --> 1:51:07.320]  to reduce your fertility and to lower your testosterone level.
[1:51:07.320 --> 1:51:09.280]  Women, the reason we have the highest rate of cancer
[1:51:09.280 --> 1:51:12.280]  in the U.S. and breast cancer is because the estrogen
[1:51:12.280 --> 1:51:14.760]  mimickers and the bisphenol A, I care about you.
[1:51:16.200 --> 1:51:18.320]  And nobody's gonna care about you in the establishment
[1:51:18.320 --> 1:51:19.800]  when they're sucking all the money out of you
[1:51:19.800 --> 1:51:23.560]  at a hospital and you're putting the ground in a year.
[1:51:23.560 --> 1:51:24.600]  And no one will wanna admit
[1:51:24.600 --> 1:51:27.400]  they didn't avoid the cancer causing stuff.
[1:51:27.400 --> 1:51:29.320]  Just it's time to turn it around now.
[1:51:29.320 --> 1:51:31.560]  And for a lot of you that serve the system,
[1:51:31.560 --> 1:51:33.400]  I know a lot of you aren't gonna listen,
[1:51:33.400 --> 1:51:34.240]  but I've studied this.
[1:51:34.240 --> 1:51:36.400]  Only the royalty and the top elites
[1:51:36.400 --> 1:51:38.160]  are obsessed with organic food.
[1:51:38.160 --> 1:51:41.080]  They haven't flown with them everywhere they go.
[1:51:41.080 --> 1:51:42.920]  You can look this up, it's incredible.
[1:51:42.920 --> 1:51:46.040]  Just look up each globalist and then type in organic food.
[1:51:46.040 --> 1:51:47.960]  You'll find they have their own farms and gardens
[1:51:47.960 --> 1:51:51.200]  and are obsessed and carried on their own jets in each case.
[1:51:51.200 --> 1:51:52.880]  If it's a eugenicist talking about reducing
[1:51:52.880 --> 1:51:55.960]  her population, Bill Gates, the British role family,
[1:51:55.960 --> 1:51:58.560]  Dutch role family, Ted Turner, any of them,
[1:51:58.560 --> 1:52:00.640]  they're now obsessed with their own food and water
[1:52:00.640 --> 1:52:01.760]  everywhere with them.
[1:52:01.760 --> 1:52:03.400]  You know why, folks?
[1:52:03.400 --> 1:52:05.680]  They're all making statements how they wanna kill you.
[1:52:05.680 --> 1:52:07.880]  They're top scientists that own the companies
[1:52:07.880 --> 1:52:09.800]  giving you the food you're eating.
[1:52:09.800 --> 1:52:11.720]  Okay, so I know you won't listen now,
[1:52:11.720 --> 1:52:13.760]  but when your 10-year-old gets that cancer,
[1:52:13.760 --> 1:52:15.680]  I want you to go look up that 50 years ago,
[1:52:15.680 --> 1:52:17.280]  no children got cancer.
[1:52:17.280 --> 1:52:19.720]  Or when your wife, that pretty little 35-year-old,
[1:52:19.720 --> 1:52:22.400]  gets that breast cancer and they wanna chop her up
[1:52:22.400 --> 1:52:24.200]  and then a year later she's dead or whatever,
[1:52:24.200 --> 1:52:27.520]  then you'll look up what I told you, okay?
[1:52:27.520 --> 1:52:30.800]  Because the wages are going under this or death.
[1:52:30.800 --> 1:52:32.680]  The wages of being part of the system
[1:52:32.680 --> 1:52:35.000]  and oh, I don't talk about kooky stuff like that,
[1:52:35.000 --> 1:52:37.720]  Alex Jones, the wages of that are death.
[1:52:37.720 --> 1:52:39.000]  Can you understand that?
[1:52:39.000 --> 1:52:40.480]  This is real.
[1:52:40.480 --> 1:52:41.800]  This is real.
[1:52:41.800 --> 1:52:43.200]  This is real.
[1:52:43.200 --> 1:52:45.680]  As real as it gets, okay?
[1:52:45.680 --> 1:52:47.000]  As real as it gets.
[1:52:47.000 --> 1:52:50.080]  I know I'm the bad man because I wasn't out of a restaurant
[1:52:50.080 --> 1:52:53.720]  like 40 people gathered around that woman watching her die.
[1:52:53.720 --> 1:52:56.200]  I went over and did the Heimlich maneuver.
[1:52:56.200 --> 1:52:59.040]  Not because I'm anything special, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:52:59.040 --> 1:53:00.840]  Quite frankly, you crossed me.
[1:53:00.840 --> 1:53:02.640]  I'm one of the most hateful, vindictive,
[1:53:02.640 --> 1:53:04.080]  aggressive people you can imagine.
[1:53:04.080 --> 1:53:04.920]  You know why?
[1:53:04.920 --> 1:53:05.760]  Because I'm real.
[1:53:05.760 --> 1:53:06.760]  I'm a real human being.
[1:53:06.760 --> 1:53:08.160]  I bleed red blood.
[1:53:09.000 --> 1:53:10.200]  I have real passions.
[1:53:10.200 --> 1:53:12.360]  I don't want to be a slave.
[1:53:12.360 --> 1:53:13.400]  You understand that?
[1:53:13.400 --> 1:53:14.760]  You have been warned.
[1:53:14.760 --> 1:53:16.240]  You have been warned.
[1:53:16.240 --> 1:53:19.200]  You have been absolutely told what's going on.
[1:53:19.200 --> 1:53:21.200]  None of this crud matters.
[1:53:21.200 --> 1:53:22.840]  Aaron, I'm sorry, I dragged you in here to talk
[1:53:22.840 --> 1:53:24.360]  as you're up here working and I'm ranting,
[1:53:24.360 --> 1:53:25.680]  but your view overall on this.
[1:53:25.680 --> 1:53:27.160]  No, I appreciate you letting me say that too,
[1:53:27.160 --> 1:53:28.920]  because I've talked to friends who,
[1:53:28.920 --> 1:53:30.000]  they say they're pissed off
[1:53:30.000 --> 1:53:31.600]  because their grandmother died of cancer.
[1:53:31.600 --> 1:53:33.040]  So now they want to go to grad school
[1:53:33.040 --> 1:53:34.640]  and be part of the pharma system.
[1:53:34.640 --> 1:53:36.800]  I told them, you look up the Maurice Hillerman clip
[1:53:36.800 --> 1:53:38.840]  where they laugh about cancer in the vaccines.
[1:53:38.840 --> 1:53:40.360]  Look up the congressional testimony
[1:53:40.360 --> 1:53:41.440]  where they talk about the taint
[1:53:41.440 --> 1:53:42.600]  and their eyes glaze over.
[1:53:42.600 --> 1:53:43.440]  But going back to the-
[1:53:43.440 --> 1:53:44.440]  No, no, no, no, breast cancer.
[1:53:44.440 --> 1:53:45.840]  Always treat it.
[1:53:45.840 --> 1:53:48.320]  Don't ask why it's up 3,000%.
[1:53:48.320 --> 1:53:49.440]  Treat it.
[1:53:49.440 --> 1:53:50.520]  Don't ask.
[1:53:50.520 --> 1:53:52.120]  It's like trying to learn how to treat somebody
[1:53:52.120 --> 1:53:53.160]  run over by a Mack truck
[1:53:53.160 --> 1:53:54.560]  instead of don't be run over by the Mack truck.
[1:53:54.560 --> 1:53:55.400]  I'm sorry.
[1:53:55.400 --> 1:53:56.760]  But this is someone who's a Ron Paul supporter.
[1:53:56.760 --> 1:53:57.720]  They know about 9-11.
[1:53:57.720 --> 1:53:58.560]  They know what's going on,
[1:53:58.560 --> 1:53:59.680]  but they won't go that extra step.
[1:53:59.680 --> 1:54:00.520]  They can't face it.
[1:54:00.520 --> 1:54:02.560]  But look at what's here in this satire,
[1:54:02.560 --> 1:54:05.240]  this humor article about how 2 billion people
[1:54:05.240 --> 1:54:07.680]  need to voluntarily commit suicide.
[1:54:07.680 --> 1:54:10.080]  Oh, it is in Australia, ABC News Australia.
[1:54:10.080 --> 1:54:11.080]  They actually, we showed it.
[1:54:11.080 --> 1:54:13.000]  They teach the kids to commit suicide.
[1:54:13.000 --> 1:54:15.640]  But here it's suicide by voluntary ignorance
[1:54:15.640 --> 1:54:17.360]  about the stuff we've been warned about.
[1:54:17.360 --> 1:54:19.840]  They joke in here about how half the world's progeny
[1:54:19.840 --> 1:54:21.200]  have to be sterilized,
[1:54:21.200 --> 1:54:23.240]  how they could poison the world's water supply
[1:54:23.240 --> 1:54:24.080]  to kill us.
[1:54:24.080 --> 1:54:25.440]  That's in this humor article.
[1:54:25.440 --> 1:54:27.280]  Well, you know, as well as I do, it's real-
[1:54:27.280 --> 1:54:28.800]  That's in the White House documents.
[1:54:28.800 --> 1:54:30.480]  It's been done at least since the 70s.
[1:54:30.480 --> 1:54:31.320]  Yeah.
[1:54:31.320 --> 1:54:33.720]  Well, at least since 1969,
[1:54:33.720 --> 1:54:35.880]  when Planned Parenthood's vice president
[1:54:35.880 --> 1:54:38.240]  wrote a secret memo saying they should put fertility,
[1:54:38.240 --> 1:54:39.760]  control agents in the water,
[1:54:39.760 --> 1:54:41.080]  and encourage some sexuality
[1:54:41.080 --> 1:54:42.560]  and a whole bunch of other junk.
[1:54:42.560 --> 1:54:44.000]  You, as well as I know that-
[1:54:44.000 --> 1:54:46.000]  And then they make it about bashing gay people.
[1:54:46.000 --> 1:54:48.880]  Hey, buddy, I'm not upset about what you're doing
[1:54:48.880 --> 1:54:49.720]  in your bedroom.
[1:54:49.720 --> 1:54:51.080]  The point is they put chemicals in there
[1:54:51.080 --> 1:54:52.440]  to confuse sexuality.
[1:54:52.440 --> 1:54:54.680]  That's why our runoff from our sewage is so bad.
[1:54:54.680 --> 1:54:56.520]  Most of the fish are bisexual now,
[1:54:56.520 --> 1:54:58.440]  and the entire life cycle's breaking down.
[1:54:58.440 --> 1:55:00.320]  I'm talking about chemicals in your water.
[1:55:00.320 --> 1:55:01.880]  It's not even, it doesn't-
[1:55:01.880 --> 1:55:02.720]  No, I know.
[1:55:02.720 --> 1:55:03.560]  I know.
[1:55:03.560 --> 1:55:05.040]  That's why they've had hundreds of publications
[1:55:05.040 --> 1:55:07.880]  attack us on this point, saying we're anti-gay,
[1:55:07.880 --> 1:55:10.800]  because they're so scared folks are gonna look this up.
[1:55:10.800 --> 1:55:12.480]  They wanna make it about a political correct,
[1:55:12.480 --> 1:55:13.760]  religious thing, where they go,
[1:55:13.760 --> 1:55:15.920]  ooh, he was mean to our sexuality.
[1:55:15.920 --> 1:55:18.040]  Well, how about when Eric Pionka did his speech
[1:55:18.040 --> 1:55:19.560]  at the Texas Academy of Sciences,
[1:55:19.560 --> 1:55:22.000]  and the audience of scientists laughed about
[1:55:22.000 --> 1:55:24.120]  how we need to, quote, sterilize everyone-
[1:55:24.120 --> 1:55:25.600]  Through the water and kill everybody,
[1:55:25.600 --> 1:55:27.960]  and they actually started crying at some point.
[1:55:27.960 --> 1:55:28.800]  Yeah.
[1:55:28.800 --> 1:55:30.760]  Oh, kill everybody, oh, murder.
[1:55:30.760 --> 1:55:32.680]  We're control freaks, we're in on the plan
[1:55:32.680 --> 1:55:35.200]  to kill everybody, oh, we're so cool.
[1:55:36.880 --> 1:55:38.680]  Laboratories all over the United States
[1:55:38.680 --> 1:55:40.480]  with airborne stuff that kills over 90%
[1:55:40.480 --> 1:55:41.920]  of the people it comes in contact with.
[1:55:41.920 --> 1:55:43.400]  Hey cops, how you gonna like it
[1:55:43.400 --> 1:55:45.720]  when that stuff gets out and your kids are all dead?
[1:55:45.720 --> 1:55:46.920]  They'll probably blame us.
[1:55:49.560 --> 1:55:51.920]  Aaron, look at this article, you did one on this,
[1:55:51.920 --> 1:55:53.280]  but it's also NRA's reporting,
[1:55:53.280 --> 1:55:55.960]  New Jersey assembly moves to ban all handgun
[1:55:55.960 --> 1:55:58.200]  and most rival ammo, including any guns
[1:55:58.200 --> 1:56:01.320]  that have been altered, including putting a scope on them.
[1:56:01.320 --> 1:56:02.520]  This is out of ammo land,
[1:56:02.520 --> 1:56:05.040]  but you have a big article at infowords.com.
[1:56:05.040 --> 1:56:07.480]  And now we learned all over the country
[1:56:07.480 --> 1:56:09.800]  they're introducing legislation to ban ammo.
[1:56:09.800 --> 1:56:11.120]  Oh, here's another one.
[1:56:11.120 --> 1:56:13.960]  United Nations is preparing to manage global mental health.
[1:56:13.960 --> 1:56:15.760]  They're gonna write all the guidelines on that.
[1:56:15.760 --> 1:56:17.600]  They say not trusting authorities mentally,
[1:56:17.600 --> 1:56:20.260]  oh, Aaron, all the founding fathers were bad.
[1:56:21.600 --> 1:56:22.360]  Here's some more.
[1:56:22.360 --> 1:56:25.880]  Forced to stand for 24 hours, suicide nets,
[1:56:25.880 --> 1:56:29.280]  toxin exposure and explosions inside the Chinese factories
[1:56:29.280 --> 1:56:31.000]  making iPads for Apple,
[1:56:31.000 --> 1:56:33.200]  but Al Gore's on their board, so it's trendy.
[1:56:34.040 --> 1:56:35.360]  The whole global system,
[1:56:35.360 --> 1:56:37.600]  the stuff they do at Davos and the G20,
[1:56:37.600 --> 1:56:39.800]  we're supposed to buy into it and sympathize
[1:56:39.800 --> 1:56:41.600]  with how we're gonna help and save the world.
[1:56:41.600 --> 1:56:43.360]  Look what the IMF does, they put in those-
[1:56:43.360 --> 1:56:46.560]  Davos is saying that, oh, they're gonna fix everything.
[1:56:46.560 --> 1:56:48.360]  They're the ones that raped everyone.
[1:56:48.360 --> 1:56:49.760]  Yeah, that's what the IMF does-
[1:56:49.760 --> 1:56:51.760]  They're the criminals that stole all the money
[1:56:51.760 --> 1:56:54.280]  that own the whore media that lies to you.
[1:56:54.280 --> 1:56:55.920]  They're all eugenicists at Davos.
[1:56:55.920 --> 1:56:58.040]  They always shoot their mouths up there.
[1:56:58.040 --> 1:56:59.640]  These are people so evil,
[1:56:59.640 --> 1:57:02.120]  they get off on your wife dying of breast cancer.
[1:57:02.120 --> 1:57:02.960]  I'm sorry.
[1:57:02.960 --> 1:57:03.920]  If you can barely read,
[1:57:03.920 --> 1:57:07.120]  you can at least watch the movie Life Plus Dead on the IMF,
[1:57:07.120 --> 1:57:09.200]  how they put Jamaica into receivership,
[1:57:09.200 --> 1:57:11.340]  how they weren't allowed to export their own crops
[1:57:11.340 --> 1:57:14.160]  or even trade them in their own country,
[1:57:14.160 --> 1:57:16.160]  how when they complained about the wage controls,
[1:57:16.160 --> 1:57:18.440]  they brought in Chinese slaves to take the jobs
[1:57:18.440 --> 1:57:20.780]  the IMF created to save the country.
[1:57:20.780 --> 1:57:22.120]  They did that to every third world.
[1:57:22.120 --> 1:57:24.400]  Jamaica, my parents were together 30 years ago
[1:57:24.400 --> 1:57:26.880]  all the time, it was awesome, happy people, great.
[1:57:26.880 --> 1:57:30.680]  Now it is, I've been there, a living hell pit.
[1:57:30.680 --> 1:57:32.200]  But that's what the globalists do.
[1:57:32.200 --> 1:57:34.040]  Hey, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:57:34.040 --> 1:57:35.160]  you're gonna find out,
[1:57:35.160 --> 1:57:37.120]  because let me tell you, we tried to stop it.
[1:57:37.120 --> 1:57:39.960]  It's gonna roll on, but it's running into problems.
[1:57:39.960 --> 1:57:41.520]  The globalists are having problems.
[1:57:41.520 --> 1:57:43.320]  It's all at infowars.com.
[1:57:43.320 --> 1:57:45.840]  Humanity's gotta awaken to defeat this tyranny.
[1:57:45.840 --> 1:57:46.760]  We'll see you back tomorrow,
[1:57:46.760 --> 1:57:52.760]  11 a.m. Central on the radio.
