[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:20.800]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.800 --> 00:27.240]  well as usual we have an ultra massive overflow of over-the-top news and a bunch
[00:27.240 --> 00:35.280]  of guests joining us today I always follow my gut especially as I live
[00:35.280 --> 00:41.280]  longer I learned that it's never wrong and the day before they did the fake
[00:41.280 --> 00:44.680]  bin Laden raid I was really upset and called the crew together on that
[00:44.680 --> 00:49.260]  Saturday and the next day they staged the raid and it's not that killing one
[00:49.260 --> 00:54.720]  person or killing some body double was what got me in my gut so upset it
[00:54.720 --> 01:00.880]  signaled the launch and the rollout of a larger chain reaction and then on the
[01:00.880 --> 01:05.680]  morning of Scalia's death approximately eight hours before it was announced I
[01:05.680 --> 01:10.480]  got really freaked out every culture knows about this everybody's got a
[01:10.480 --> 01:16.440]  grandma or a cousin or a brother or they themselves you have learned that their
[01:16.440 --> 01:23.640]  gut is particularly sensitive and accurate call it the sixth sense whatever
[01:23.640 --> 01:32.160]  you want label it as it's real and I actually called Rob dude Buckley and
[01:32.160 --> 01:37.160]  Anthony guilty already down here on that Saturday we were here from noon until
[01:37.160 --> 01:40.800]  eight at night even an hour after Scalia's death was announced I didn't even
[01:40.800 --> 01:44.840]  know because I was busy planning things and talking about how they're getting
[01:44.840 --> 01:47.760]  ready to start a race war and how they're getting ready to try to start a
[01:47.760 --> 01:57.000]  war with North Korea and Russia and I was running around like a Jack Russell
[01:57.000 --> 02:07.400]  Terrier just trying to desperately figure out why I was so upset that morning
[02:07.400 --> 02:12.560]  and isn't just they killed Scalia it's that they would do it in part of a
[02:12.560 --> 02:16.080]  secret society the evidence of all points at it throw it in our face that
[02:16.080 --> 02:21.680]  there was no autopsy and it signifies where they're going with the entire
[02:21.680 --> 02:29.160]  intimidation of this government and other major governments it isn't just his
[02:29.160 --> 02:36.000]  death it's that it signified a new phase now I don't know what's going on right
[02:36.000 --> 02:46.560]  now and I have a million thoughts going through my mind a minute but let's say
[02:46.560 --> 02:52.440]  the most upset I ever got was in the three weeks before 9-11 really started
[02:52.440 --> 02:55.640]  two months before but in the weeks before you can go back to my radio show
[02:55.640 --> 02:58.680]  they're getting ready to stage giant terror attacks they're getting ready to
[02:58.680 --> 03:01.680]  take our liberties they're getting ready to launch what will turn into world
[03:01.680 --> 03:06.520]  government they'll probably blame their CIA asset someone bin Laden you can just
[03:06.520 --> 03:11.720]  type into Google Alex Jones predicted 9-11 and you can see the TV show here
[03:11.720 --> 03:17.600]  the radio show you name it that was the strongest I ever felt the bin Laden
[03:17.600 --> 03:27.480]  thing was big Scalia was huge what I'm feeling now let me not exaggerate it's
[03:27.480 --> 03:34.800]  about 20 times what I felt before 9-11 I can barely be on air right now okay I
[03:34.800 --> 03:38.440]  don't know if it's nuclear war I don't know if it's a stock market crash I
[03:38.440 --> 03:41.960]  don't know if they're gonna assassinate Donald Trump I don't know if it's
[03:41.960 --> 03:47.040]  somebody coming after me personally but I use the allegory or the analogy of in
[03:47.040 --> 03:51.160]  the Lord of the Rings they've got the sword staying that when the goblins or
[03:51.160 --> 03:58.920]  the orcs are near it glows blue well the swords glowing as blue as that
[03:58.920 --> 04:02.680]  background you see right there if you're watching this on television bright
[04:02.680 --> 04:05.400]  white blue
[04:10.000 --> 04:15.200]  and I think about the things we've already caught these sinister forces doing
[04:15.200 --> 04:26.560]  what we know is so over the top that I have no idea I have no idea what else
[04:26.560 --> 04:30.200]  they're up to that we don't know about I mean they've been acting in total
[04:30.200 --> 04:36.320]  secrecy with all of our money and all of our science since 1947 God knows what
[04:36.320 --> 04:45.080]  they built they have the equations for atomic weapons in 1900 it's 2016 the
[04:45.080 --> 04:50.080]  reality we're living in undoubtedly is a sub basement of the real
[04:50.080 --> 04:58.880]  technocracy built all around us we're already in the matrix thanks to the
[04:58.880 --> 05:02.320]  Federal Reserve System America's economy is in a terminal decline and
[05:02.320 --> 05:05.680]  according to economic expert Michael Snyder here's eight facts that reveal
[05:05.680 --> 05:09.560]  just how bad the economy really is number one majority of all American
[05:09.560 --> 05:13.920]  workers bring home less than $30,000 a year in wages number two the poorest
[05:13.920 --> 05:17.760]  40% of all Americans now spend most of their incomes just on food and housing
[05:17.760 --> 05:21.680]  number three at least 50% of Americans who rent their homes spend more than a
[05:21.680 --> 05:25.520]  third of their incomes on the rent number four incomes keep declining for a
[05:25.520 --> 05:29.760]  large majority of the US population number five the price of ground beef has
[05:29.760 --> 05:34.520]  more than doubled since 2009 number six the rate of home ownership in the US has
[05:34.520 --> 05:38.120]  been declining for at least seven years in a row is now the lowest that has been
[05:38.120 --> 05:42.120]  in 20 years number seven almost half of all Americans are not saving their
[05:42.120 --> 05:46.080]  money and it's been estimated that 62% of Americans are living paycheck to
[05:46.080 --> 05:49.360]  paycheck number eight one third of all Americans with student loans are

[08:27.840 --> 08:32.040]  several affiliates in chicago and one of the affiliates that carries our show
[08:32.040 --> 08:37.480]  six days a week the owner of the station manager of the station is going to be
[08:37.480 --> 08:45.880]  popping in at the start of the next hour he was in the black lives matter move on
[08:45.880 --> 08:53.520]  dot org hillary clinton sponsored operation last Friday and even shot
[08:53.520 --> 08:57.120]  some video of it he's gonna be popping in to give his particular view and
[08:57.120 --> 09:03.040]  perspective on it and then we're also going to have the consummate trump
[09:03.040 --> 09:08.640]  insider roger stone joining us he's got a daily caller article dealing with the
[09:08.640 --> 09:14.320]  fact of who Ted Cruz really works for and there's also another article out
[09:14.320 --> 09:18.400]  dealing with the sex scandal that's about to break dealing with Ted Cruz as
[09:18.400 --> 09:26.040]  well we're gonna be looking at that with mr. stone coming up also stone had
[09:26.040 --> 09:37.600]  people inside the hillary slash david brock media matters meetings in DC days
[09:37.600 --> 09:40.800]  before when they were planning what they did last week in Chicago that's now
[09:40.800 --> 09:45.000]  spreading to other cities but that was the that was the beta test detonator
[09:45.000 --> 09:49.440]  thousands of protesters coming in and attacking the trump supporters and vice
[09:49.440 --> 09:59.560]  versa police being attacked you name it and people waving Bernie Sanders signs
[09:59.560 --> 10:06.400]  and chanting burning well move on dot org is supporting Hillary George Soros
[10:06.400 --> 10:13.120]  funds move on dot org and Bernie having his people do this in reality gives him
[10:13.120 --> 10:18.480]  a black eye and then Hillary stays out of the fight while Trump and the Sanders
[10:18.480 --> 10:23.440]  people go after each other Hillary also knows that the Sanders people a large
[10:23.440 --> 10:27.920]  portion of them in polls will not go for Hillary so they need to condition the
[10:27.920 --> 10:32.240]  Bernie supporters psychologically to hate Trump and actually hear that Bernie
[10:32.240 --> 10:37.200]  supporters are going after Trump to create a domino effect a snowball effect
[10:37.200 --> 10:41.880]  a copycat effect and to have them actually go after Trump so it's a very
[10:41.880 --> 10:48.640]  sophisticated Psyop and Trump knows that the public is somewhat simple and dumb
[10:48.640 --> 10:51.800]  down so he just keeps going with Bernie your communist you better watch it
[10:51.800 --> 10:55.240]  because they got Bernie signs that professionally printed they're saying
[10:55.240 --> 10:58.880]  there for Sanders the only problem is Sanders doesn't have a history of
[10:58.880 --> 11:03.560]  calling for violence and for taking over demonstrations and it's not really his
[11:03.560 --> 11:07.680]  style and we've not seen him deploying these type of dirty tricks we have seen
[11:07.680 --> 11:12.080]  George Soros and Hillary do this all over the world not just here so this is
[11:12.080 --> 11:18.800]  their MO and they took credit so I got to say Donald Trump is wrong and his
[11:18.800 --> 11:22.600]  advisor is right and I don't like to set the two against each other but Trump is
[11:22.600 --> 11:27.520]  his own man this has been known since Saturday I interviewed stone Saturday we
[11:27.520 --> 11:31.280]  aired it yesterday on the Sunday show the interview is up on them full wars
[11:31.280 --> 11:36.040]  calm and on prison planet calm as well we're gonna be talking about that now
[11:36.040 --> 11:40.040]  that said here's just a smattering of the news I tend to not get to the tech
[11:40.040 --> 11:44.560]  news though it's some of the most important let me just mention what's
[11:44.560 --> 11:50.600]  coming up in that little stack media mogul plans to live forever by uploading
[11:50.600 --> 11:54.600]  his personality into a robot London Telegraph now only reason I read that as
[11:54.600 --> 11:58.280]  you've heard that here thousands of times this is what MIT was saying 30 years
[11:58.280 --> 12:04.880]  ago as the plan now they're just pushing it openly here's another one how gut
[12:04.880 --> 12:10.840]  bacteria are shaking up cancer research Bloomberg business we have had medical
[12:10.840 --> 12:16.240]  doctors on we have had top vaccine experts on
[12:16.240 --> 12:25.880]  endocrinologist on experts on the gut we've had all these different types of
[12:25.880 --> 12:32.240]  medical doctors on and we've had Dr. Groupon breaking down the fact that
[12:32.240 --> 12:38.880]  pesticides especially roundup in the stomach and in the intestines upper and
[12:38.880 --> 12:45.640]  lower large and small intestine is killing the buffers in your body and
[12:45.640 --> 12:50.080]  then you're getting bad bacteria you're getting toxic yeast you're getting
[12:50.080 --> 12:58.680]  other toxic fungi and that your autoimmune system shuts down and then
[12:58.680 --> 13:05.400]  the T lymphocytes have to actually battle inside the bloodstream and inside
[13:05.400 --> 13:10.720]  the tissues things they never have to fight because the walls are down the
[13:10.720 --> 13:17.840]  gates are down and that the genetically engineered crops as well have been
[13:17.840 --> 13:23.360]  shown in major studies to leak into the actual DNA of the cells and cause
[13:23.360 --> 13:32.240]  mutation so roundup grows many cancers that's admitted glyphosate brand name
[13:32.240 --> 13:38.880]  roundup billions of tons a year billions dumped it's just everywhere weed
[13:38.880 --> 13:46.080]  killer it grows tumors you're also eating GMO crops that leach into your DNA
[13:46.080 --> 13:51.240]  and cause mutations but none of that compares to the shield being down in
[13:51.240 --> 13:57.800]  your gut now we don't sell a probiotic yet because we're trying to have the
[13:57.800 --> 14:02.160]  very best cutting-edge system they use in Europe and I just finally said let's
[14:02.160 --> 14:05.680]  just have the best we have right now so the three years of not being able to put
[14:05.680 --> 14:10.760]  out you know this patented stuff that's the very best let's put out the very
[14:10.760 --> 14:16.920]  best we've got now and we're doing that but if you're not taking probiotics
[14:16.920 --> 14:21.560]  different brands different types constantly you are insane and again I
[14:21.560 --> 14:25.760]  don't sell them yet you are out of your mind because you've got to keep
[14:25.760 --> 14:31.360]  replacing the bacteria because the bioaccumulation of fluoride which is an
[14:31.360 --> 14:36.160]  original pesticide the oldest pesticide used since modern agriculture it's over
[14:36.160 --> 14:43.040]  300 years old the fluoride the hydrofluorosalic acid that's the souped
[14:43.040 --> 14:52.160]  up acid-based fluoride the weaponized fluoride the fluoride squared basically
[14:52.160 --> 14:55.600]  and then you've got the glyphosates and then you've got all these other
[14:55.600 --> 15:01.240]  pesticides that are bioaccumulating and you're eating it and it's killing the
[15:01.240 --> 15:08.680]  bacteria in your stomach and then there's no buffer there because normal the
[15:08.680 --> 15:15.080]  bacteria would absorb that and eat that and instead it's going right through
[15:15.080 --> 15:20.360]  into your intestine wall right into your bloodstream and the and the number one
[15:20.360 --> 15:24.680]  thing you can do it's not even avoiding toxins that's important the number one
[15:24.680 --> 15:28.680]  thing is drink clean purified water and just pump good bacteria into your guts
[15:28.680 --> 15:37.000]  and that means also eating pickled things whether it be sauerkraut or
[15:37.000 --> 15:41.840]  pickles or all the hundreds of other things that are out there you better be
[15:41.840 --> 15:47.640]  doing it and you better be giving it to your kids because here is Bloomberg
[15:47.640 --> 15:51.560]  business and they just admit okay that's why cancer is exploding yes it's one of
[15:51.560 --> 15:56.520]  the big ones now a lot of cancer is exploding also because it's viral there's
[15:56.520 --> 16:01.640]  a lot of weaponized cancer but if you if your immune system hasn't given up it
[16:01.640 --> 16:10.280]  will identify it and beat it a couple hundred times to zero but that's why
[16:10.280 --> 16:15.280]  everybody's getting allergies is your normal stuff that you would be able to
[16:15.280 --> 16:21.800]  deal with like hay fever or mountain juniper or oak or mold your body is just
[16:21.800 --> 16:28.200]  like man I give up I want to lay down I'm sick I'm hurt I'm my sinuses are
[16:28.200 --> 16:33.280]  swelling up my lungs hurt I'm hurt and your body is battling like someone in
[16:33.280 --> 16:38.400]  the Atlantic Ocean in 55 degree temperature not to die I mean you're
[16:38.400 --> 16:43.040]  just flailing trying to keep the immune system on try and not to freeze up and
[16:43.040 --> 16:49.160]  die and believe me folks this is all been engineered the globalist are on record
[16:49.160 --> 16:55.960]  it is going to get to where half of the people have cancer when I was in England
[16:55.960 --> 16:58.640]  a few years ago it was a London Telegraph headline the physical paper at the
[16:58.640 --> 17:08.240]  hotel that by 2025 half of Brits would have cancer by 2025 one in three in the
[17:08.240 --> 17:17.400]  US will have autism look it up one in three and see I'm gonna hit all this
[17:17.400 --> 17:20.880]  other news I have hundreds of articles and I just got into two of them and I
[17:20.880 --> 17:24.240]  stopped but but it's so important because all everything else is a side
[17:24.240 --> 17:28.560]  show it really is
[17:31.840 --> 17:42.000]  we are being targeted we are being hit Bell and Melinda Gates on record are
[17:42.000 --> 17:45.440]  spending their money on genetic engineering forced inoculation through
[17:45.440 --> 17:56.840]  food mosquitoes and quote gut flora crisis because they know in the future
[17:56.840 --> 18:02.840]  our guts are gonna be so screwed up if we don't go and get the patented systems
[18:02.840 --> 18:07.520]  and superbugs that they've developed to block the other superbugs we're going to
[18:07.520 --> 18:11.960]  die everything that Monsanto and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation does
[18:11.960 --> 18:17.600]  is about making life on this planet independent of them impossible it's a
[18:17.600 --> 18:25.120]  monopoly on everything and their main mission is to normalize all this horror
[18:25.120 --> 18:32.080]  around us so that we just incrementally accept that breast cancer is up

[24:22.240 --> 24:26.880]  saviors bring in a world government that micromanages and taxes every action
[24:26.880 --> 24:31.840]  for social engineering to phase out humanity as we know it that's all
[24:31.840 --> 24:36.080]  stated it's on record I talked about it 20 years ago people didn't believe me
[24:36.080 --> 24:42.880]  now it's mainstream news but a large part of the public is in a trance state
[24:42.880 --> 24:52.120]  basically they watch television all day they're in a I guess you'd use the word
[24:52.120 --> 25:01.000]  sleepwalking mode physically that's not a term I'm using they're in a dream state
[25:01.000 --> 25:08.560]  they're daydreaming we are living in a dystopic science fiction reality and
[25:08.560 --> 25:13.120]  it's about to all get a lot worse because everything has been set up so far
[25:13.120 --> 25:19.120]  which is the beta testing and the preparations the New World Order is
[25:19.120 --> 25:26.200]  going operational as we speak on every front they have now commenced their
[25:26.200 --> 25:32.760]  soft kill operations they are intensifying their electronic warfare
[25:32.760 --> 25:37.200]  systems through the televisions and through other wavelengths they are
[25:37.200 --> 25:41.440]  openly announcing they're going to quote calm us with the new lightbulbs that
[25:41.440 --> 25:47.440]  have supersonic flicker rates that the eye cannot even catch but are
[25:47.440 --> 26:00.040]  perceivable in the brain through the optic nerves it is the equivalent of a
[26:00.040 --> 26:05.120]  deep space alien attack I just there's no other way to describe it real aliens
[26:05.120 --> 26:08.680]  would not come to the planet and sit there like in a movie like war of the
[26:08.680 --> 26:12.360]  world shooting laser beams at people and grabbing folks with big tentacles and
[26:12.360 --> 26:16.880]  eating them okay wouldn't be like that it would be like what you're seeing right
[26:16.880 --> 26:22.160]  here the trees would be programmed genetically to start poisoning everyone
[26:22.160 --> 26:27.520]  the crops would be changed to slowly kill you you would slowly be given more
[26:27.520 --> 26:31.760]  and more high dosages of poison through the shots in the water until you're so
[26:31.760 --> 26:36.000]  drugged out and so mindless you don't even see what's coming there'd be
[26:36.000 --> 26:43.480]  fabulous distractions and social engineering to manipulate you and no I
[26:43.480 --> 26:47.920]  don't believe as I said that it's aliens from a distant planet it's psychopaths
[26:47.920 --> 26:52.440]  that have used the incredible power of the human mind and the incredible human
[26:52.440 --> 26:58.320]  power to build what we envision to take the greatest developments that our
[26:58.320 --> 27:05.960]  species has created and then to weld it together into this system we're now
[27:05.960 --> 27:12.520]  entering and it is a nightmare dystopia the likes of which the world has never
[27:12.520 --> 27:17.680]  seen and I get why a lot of people can't handle this show there are a lot of
[27:17.680 --> 27:20.760]  people that have worked here over the years that just say look I know a lot of
[27:20.760 --> 27:25.000]  this stuff's true and I'll go no it's all true look well whatever I just can't
[27:25.000 --> 27:29.760]  handle it anymore and I get it folks want to just go imagine that we're not
[27:29.760 --> 27:32.800]  being taken over they want to just go and imagine there's not a plan to destroy
[27:32.800 --> 27:37.040]  the family they want to go and imagine the tap waters fine they want to go
[27:37.040 --> 27:44.680]  quietly into that sweet night and that's fine because they can't handle the truth
[27:46.440 --> 27:52.360]  and I'm not sure I can handle it either but I know what I'm looking at and I
[27:52.360 --> 27:58.120]  know what they're doing I've read their writings I read stuff that Galton and the
[27:58.120 --> 28:04.080]  Wedgewoods and the Huxleys and the Darwin's wrote a hundred and sixty years
[28:04.080 --> 28:08.880]  ago hundred to seventy years ago some of it and man if those people didn't build
[28:08.880 --> 28:18.480]  our world they envisioned everything they said that DNA would be discovered and
[28:18.480 --> 28:22.920]  had a double helix oh you notice the snakes going back 6,000 years or a DNA
[28:22.920 --> 28:26.880]  double helix the truth is it was all discovered before the truth is these
[28:26.880 --> 28:32.360]  secret society families already know the truth is there was a civilization
[28:32.360 --> 28:36.760]  before this every ancient culture says it's called Atlantis and it was all
[28:36.760 --> 28:44.240]  blown away Plato's history book talks about it it was out in the Atlantic Ocean
[28:44.240 --> 28:51.320]  and the entrance of the Mediterranean it's it's it's it's exploding could be
[28:51.320 --> 28:55.600]  seen thousands of miles away
[28:55.600 --> 29:04.760]  there wasn't sunny days for three years there was so much dust in the air when
[29:04.760 --> 29:11.120]  whatever it is blew up or whatever it was slammed in and I've reverse
[29:11.120 --> 29:14.600]  engineered all this reading the history books the ancient legends all of it
[29:14.600 --> 29:19.600]  because the elite have data and knowledge they knew the world was round
[29:19.600 --> 29:24.600]  they knew that there was a passage to not to India but to the New World the
[29:24.600 --> 29:28.040]  Vikings knew that a thousand years before on record they knew thousands of
[29:28.040 --> 29:34.000]  years before that and that's what I'm getting at here is this whole system is
[29:34.000 --> 29:38.340]  about keeping us from discovering what's actually going on the elites know
[29:38.340 --> 29:42.320]  the secrets and they're trying to keep them from us to keep control we'll be
[29:42.320 --> 29:46.320]  back stay with us I'm gonna get into the campaign the rest of it

[29:57.960 --> 30:02.240]  President Obama is guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors you may not know
[30:02.240 --> 30:06.800]  about until now for one thing he illegally gave Obamacare exemptions to
[30:06.800 --> 30:10.800]  unions that supported the passage of Obamacare that's right Obama gave some
[30:10.800 --> 30:14.080]  of his favorite organizations exemption from some of Obamacare's
[30:14.080 --> 30:17.760]  requirements because many of them were unions and other groups that pressured
[30:17.760 --> 30:21.680]  the public to support the socialist program once these groups realized just
[30:21.680 --> 30:26.080]  how bad Obamacare really was they wanted exemptions from the very same law they
[30:26.080 --> 30:30.560]  force on everyone else which Obama gave them President Obama also had the IRS
[30:30.560 --> 30:34.840]  grant special illegal favors for his brother's so-called charity the Daily

[32:59.120 --> 33:17.800]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting world-wide it's Alex Jones
[33:17.800 --> 33:29.120]  all right we will be covering more dealing with the breakaways civilization
[33:29.120 --> 33:34.800]  of the globalist rebuilding exactly what that means I'm gonna go into reports
[33:34.800 --> 33:44.320]  looking at the writings of the British technocracy and how they basically
[33:44.320 --> 33:49.840]  envisioned the modern world that was built in the 1850s then through their
[33:49.840 --> 33:56.800]  mouthpiece as she wells by 1900 they were openly putting the information out
[33:56.800 --> 34:01.600]  in the novel form as predictive programming to prepare the public for
[34:01.600 --> 34:06.800]  what they were going to construct so what I'm getting at here is the public
[34:06.800 --> 34:14.040]  can't deal with FEMA camps that are real and admitted the public can't deal
[34:14.040 --> 34:20.640]  with the fact that fluoride massively grows tumors and even the FDA and EPA
[34:20.640 --> 34:28.440]  have shed for 16 years take it out of the water the public on average doesn't
[34:28.440 --> 34:31.200]  even know that the public until a few years ago didn't know the Federal
[34:31.200 --> 34:35.280]  Reserve was private run-for-profit
[34:35.280 --> 34:45.520]  so we've we've gotten over some major hurdles but now that the public realizes
[34:45.520 --> 34:50.040]  they're being lied to it's time for the public to really understand the true
[34:50.040 --> 34:56.440]  global structure and the way the establishment is countering that is to
[34:56.440 --> 35:02.600]  put out all these other theories and things that aren't true or aren't
[35:02.600 --> 35:11.800]  provable to confuse and basically sabotage the general public actually
[35:11.800 --> 35:19.040]  discovering the real narrative high-tech elites robber barons hiring the top
[35:19.040 --> 35:25.440]  scientific minds in Europe England Scotland the United States
[35:25.440 --> 35:34.080]  Russia Serbia Croatia one of the top minds come out of there super geniuses
[35:34.080 --> 35:46.520]  in that area statistically hiring them to develop and build the future much
[35:46.520 --> 35:52.240]  bigger than the Manhattan Project by an order of hundreds of times what is
[35:52.240 --> 35:57.920]  Hillary Clinton call the spy grid she wants to build and the Internet
[35:57.920 --> 36:03.320]  control system she calls it a giant Manhattan Project and that's what we're
[36:03.320 --> 36:07.680]  facing and I'm just here reading their own literature studying the science to
[36:07.680 --> 36:12.760]  see what they're building and to see what they say it's for and they say it's to
[36:12.760 --> 36:23.200]  make us obsolete to bring in machines and to wipe us out so I go see a movie
[36:23.200 --> 36:35.720]  like 10 Cloverfield and it's so much deeper than what the general public
[36:35.720 --> 36:46.960]  would get from that film and that novel by the way in World War two for four
[36:46.960 --> 36:55.480]  years one year into World War two the British had cracked the entire German
[36:55.480 --> 37:00.040]  code before World War two the blue and purple codes of the Japanese were all
[37:00.040 --> 37:07.080]  broken that's been declassified by the 60s they waited until the 60s they had
[37:07.080 --> 37:12.480]  the Russian codes deciphered you name it but they didn't tell them they had them
[37:12.480 --> 37:20.720]  deciphered they have all the encryption keys they have all the back doors there
[37:20.720 --> 37:25.160]  been a few sat phone companies and groups was one in Canada who wouldn't give
[37:25.160 --> 37:30.520]  them back doors those people end up dead in their swimming pools and the company
[37:30.520 --> 37:35.800]  gets shut down there's nothing out there that's widespread that's off the
[37:35.800 --> 37:41.360]  shelf that's widely used that isn't backdoor they're having this debate to
[37:41.360 --> 37:46.080]  get you to accept that they're spying on you for your safety I was watching Fox
[37:46.080 --> 37:51.080]  News this morning and singing in back and forth and it was the same script the
[37:51.080 --> 37:55.360]  French want to arrest any computer executives that don't give them back
[37:55.360 --> 37:59.440]  doors and there's this new telegram thing that's being used on iPhones and
[37:59.440 --> 38:03.960]  then ISIS is using it to launch attacks and so we've got to have the back door
[38:03.960 --> 38:09.680]  to it our government is run by criminal groups they run ISIS they were showing
[38:09.680 --> 38:15.120]  footage on Fox of US armored vehicles with ISIS waving flags and US Toyota
[38:15.120 --> 38:21.800]  trucks that they always show and they were waving in 16s in force
[38:24.120 --> 38:31.080]  there they are in their US and NATO equipped weapons Turkey backs and Saudi
[38:31.080 --> 38:37.840]  Arabia backs them and there they are with the generals on Fox News that
[38:37.840 --> 38:42.480]  particular is a Russian tank but a bunch of their equipment is US armored
[38:42.480 --> 38:47.640]  vehicles and they're they're riding around they're rumbling around in front
[38:47.640 --> 38:51.320]  of everyone funded by our government given stinger missiles by our government
[38:51.320 --> 38:54.800]  and then they look at us and they go we got to stop the threat we've got to have
[38:54.800 --> 38:59.560]  all your encryption what they're really saying is we're spying on you for your
[38:59.560 --> 39:06.720]  own good your own safety they're just making it acceptable now I want to get
[39:06.720 --> 39:11.920]  to the latest Donald Trump news here and the latest attacks on free speech but
[39:11.920 --> 39:21.440]  the good news is I'd play it but it's in French Jean-Claude Vendome it was Kurt
[39:21.440 --> 39:25.640]  Russell you know a month and a half ago it's so many of these Hollywood people
[39:25.640 --> 39:28.720]  back when I would still go out to Hollywood occasionally to be on a TV show
[39:28.720 --> 39:32.600]  or be in a little movie or something I would get invited to some of these
[39:32.600 --> 39:38.760]  parties and almost everyone was anti-vaccine almost everyone was really
[39:38.760 --> 39:42.560]  pro-gun almost everyone told me that they were scared of Sumner Redstone and
[39:42.560 --> 39:52.280]  the big chiefs who made them go out and be liberal or they'd be blackball and so
[39:52.280 --> 39:56.840]  so many of those big names you see go up and talk about global warming and talk
[39:56.840 --> 40:01.520]  about man-made global warming and and that push all this their actors and they
[40:01.520 --> 40:11.760]  know it's a fraud and they can't stand it you even see the look of their eyes when
[40:11.760 --> 40:14.680]  they get up there and do it they all know it's baloney and it's not that
[40:14.680 --> 40:17.160]  they're tuning into what I'm saying they're just tuning into the real world
[40:17.160 --> 40:21.520]  and there it is so you go read the transcript of what
[40:21.520 --> 40:27.520]  Jean-Claude Vendome said and it's directly from this broadcast but it's not
[40:27.520 --> 40:32.680]  because again I've got all the answers it's true and he described since the
[40:32.680 --> 40:37.600]  early 1800s how the Rothschilds took over Europe how they set up basically
[40:37.600 --> 40:40.360]  Napoleon all the things that are historical how they've set up a
[40:40.360 --> 40:43.480]  planetary government how globalism plays the nation-states off against each
[40:43.480 --> 40:48.880]  other and if we get rid of globalism we'll have freedom and in a great new
[40:48.880 --> 40:55.320]  renaissance I mean go read it for yourself he speaks decent English we
[40:55.320 --> 40:59.280]  really should push not that we like to get celebrities on because just to get
[40:59.280 --> 41:02.440]  a celebrity on to talk about the price of tea in China who cares you know
[41:02.440 --> 41:06.200]  Christopher Walken was on the show once I was told a few days before yeah
[41:06.200 --> 41:09.160]  Walken here's the show he likes a show but he didn't want to get political and
[41:09.160 --> 41:13.360]  he's gonna just show up you know during the Skype interview and then he shows
[41:13.360 --> 41:18.320]  up once talk about red wine and cooking chicken and I try bringing up
[41:18.320 --> 41:21.120]  politics he goes I'm not gonna do it Alex then you know he's on like ten
[41:21.120 --> 41:25.160]  minutes see there was no thrill I like Christopher Walken he's a very interesting
[41:25.160 --> 41:30.840]  actor but you know I can really care less you know about going to a farmhouse
[41:30.840 --> 41:36.680]  and eating chicken with it I don't want to lay around in Hollywood you know all
[41:36.680 --> 41:41.280]  there's fires a mile away and ash is falling on me you know with you know
[41:41.280 --> 41:46.440]  with sitting there having a butler bring me a martini that isn't fulfilling
[41:46.440 --> 41:53.280]  driving around in a $200,000 Mercedes Maybach people would sell their soul for
[41:53.280 --> 41:59.760]  that it means nothing nothing but but but this is the whole world in in
[41:59.760 --> 42:06.280]  thrall just for the petty trinkets and it's not even about the luxury it's not
[42:06.280 --> 42:12.920]  even about the security I can see wealth for security and to help others it's
[42:12.920 --> 42:18.080]  about being insecure and wanting to project that you're big and powerful to
[42:18.080 --> 42:26.760]  other people so people are selling out to feel like they're accepted and like
[42:26.760 --> 42:33.520]  they've arrived but then you have somebody like John Claude Van Damme coming
[42:33.520 --> 42:39.200]  out saying there's a world government is run by globalist Trump is an owned by
[42:39.200 --> 42:41.760]  him that's why they hate him they're coming after and they're destroying the
[42:41.760 --> 42:47.200]  nation-states on and on and on he gets it and when the paradigm shifts and
[42:47.200 --> 42:51.040]  people look to the actual controllers and the fact that they're basically tax
[42:51.040 --> 42:54.840]  exempt that they've got armed guards but don't want us to be able to have guns
[42:54.840 --> 43:01.760]  and protect ourselves when it came out that Piers Morgan had armed bodyguards
[43:01.760 --> 43:06.600]  basically his show had canceled itself no one was watching because people
[43:06.600 --> 43:10.440]  fundamentally get it so this is just more proof coming in on a weekly basis
[43:10.440 --> 43:14.320]  that I don't care if it's Japanese entertainment people are French or
[43:14.320 --> 43:21.000]  German or British or Irish or U.S. or Mexican you name it
[43:21.000 --> 43:26.120]  in the real intelligentsia and you just see that being mirrored now coming out
[43:26.120 --> 43:33.760]  of Hollywood but in real intelligentsia everybody knows this stuff with truly
[43:33.760 --> 43:38.480]  informed people this is this is just known like the Atlantic Ocean is on the
[43:38.480 --> 43:49.440]  east coast of the US on the west coast of Europe it's just known like fluoride
[43:49.440 --> 43:57.760]  causes cancer type it in you type it into a search engine EPA says remove
[43:57.760 --> 44:02.760]  fluoride from the water the feds came in and complained the chemical makers they
[44:02.760 --> 44:07.440]  said okay cut it in half that was three years ago they haven't cut it in half in
[44:07.440 --> 44:15.240]  your water even the American Dental Association for six years says don't
[44:15.240 --> 44:19.520]  have children under six breast or teeth with fluoride toothpaste it causes
[44:19.520 --> 44:25.760]  dental fluorosis and bone cancer I tell people that and they laugh at me and say
[44:25.760 --> 44:29.760]  what are you a dentist and I go well my dad is a retired oral surgeon yes but I
[44:29.760 --> 44:34.320]  can go to US Food and Registration health claim notification for fluoride
[44:34.320 --> 44:42.760]  water and reduce risk of dental carriers just type in EPA FDA says cut fluoride
[44:42.760 --> 44:47.240]  in water and you'll see it it's like Reuters all right let me get to the other

[46:54.480 --> 47:00.800]  you see I still notice it and I've been honest about it you know I was 40 went
[47:00.800 --> 47:05.320]  in and got a checkup came back in 41 the doc just said that's what medical
[47:05.320 --> 47:08.000]  doctors do he said oh you're doing pretty good blah blah your sugar is a

[47:28.160 --> 47:34.440]  vitality and Anthroplex it works so well that quite frankly I can't even take
[47:34.440 --> 47:37.240]  the two of them together and they both do different things but they're similar
[47:37.240 --> 47:40.080]  and in some form some of the fun was the same but both of them have some
[47:40.080 --> 47:43.720]  different stuff in them I think you should take them together but if you're
[47:43.720 --> 47:47.560]  like me and already are bouncing off the walls maybe not because I'll tell you
[47:47.560 --> 47:51.720]  right now Anthroplex makes me meaner than a meaner than a rattlesnake and I'll

[48:34.760 --> 48:38.400]  I kind of restate it different ways and tie it into the new news every day
[48:38.400 --> 48:45.000]  because we're under attack we've been taken over by criminals they're waging
[48:45.000 --> 48:47.800]  war against our self-sufficiency against our families against our very
[48:47.800 --> 48:52.240]  species they want men to be alone and bitter they want women to be alone and
[48:52.240 --> 48:57.920]  bitter people grow up they become trendy they try to act cool socially there
[48:57.920 --> 49:02.120]  are no jobs there isn't a future for most people the trendy guys they date
[49:02.120 --> 49:07.560]  don't deliver they get bitter then the state becomes their husband because it
[49:07.560 --> 49:13.960]  teaches them to hate men girl power girl power then the guys are just off drunk
[49:13.960 --> 49:19.280]  at the sports bar arrested development never become men this is where we're
[49:19.280 --> 49:24.640]  going this is what we become and then somebody like Donald Trump gets up there
[49:24.640 --> 49:32.200]  like an old silverback gorilla crossed with a golden-haired toad I mean that
[49:32.200 --> 49:36.440]  affectionately but the archetypal big male you know gorilla up there with a
[49:36.440 --> 49:42.040]  confident look on frowning and if you look at chimpanzee or eight faces and
[49:42.040 --> 49:44.520]  what they mean you look at Homo sapiens it's basically the same thing in
[49:44.520 --> 49:48.800]  telegraphs telegraphs I'm super cool I'm super tough I don't have to move for
[49:48.800 --> 49:53.640]  anybody the female you know apes are there picking bugs and stuff off of him

[49:57.360 --> 50:02.080]  he projects and that makes the globalist so mad because they're trying to end that
[50:02.080 --> 50:10.600]  John Wayne image of the confident male and they're just waging war I mean how
[50:10.600 --> 50:14.400]  dare he say we could have borders how dare he say we can't bring in jihadists
[50:14.400 --> 50:18.360]  how dare he say that we you know China can't have a giant internal tariff on us
[50:18.360 --> 50:21.920]  and the Chinese government comes in and says you shut your mouth and do what we
[50:21.920 --> 50:26.720]  say and the British government and the Mexican government and Bill Clinton and
[50:26.720 --> 50:30.640]  Hillary and Ted Cruz comes out and says it's Donald's fault there were
[50:30.640 --> 50:35.480]  problems in Chicago and Ohio it's his fault George Soros admits and move on

[54:21.480 --> 54:50.480]  I saw the photograph by the way I saw the photograph my son last week took a photo of a big double rainbow out in the Texas hill country and I just tweeted that out at real Alex Jones and before I did it I thought oh my gosh if I just say look at this beautiful double rainbow people will ask me what am I doing pushing me
[54:50.480 --> 55:10.480]  what am I doing pushing the gay agenda and you see that's another example of how every sacred symbol archetypal symbol has been expropriated by the social engineers even the word gay just means a happy beautiful time but now I can't use that word in relation to a beautiful
[55:10.480 --> 55:29.480]  day or a great time or if somebody was a nice young man say he was a gay lad because the social engineers have expropriated it and under political correctness they're taking every word to our Seinfeld's daughter 13 years old they go honey we live out in the country we're going to move back into New York so you can meet more
[55:29.480 --> 55:48.480]  boys and more friends you don't say the word boys and her dad said you're ignorant that's not that's not sexist or bad she goes yes it is because at her level of school it is and the older left is meant to freak out by that and go oh my gosh we're for free speech and Obama makes jokes about it
[55:48.480 --> 56:10.480]  and Bill Maher makes jokes about it but this is the plan to create basket cases I call it a cult because it is a cult they don't work they don't know how to tie their shoes or cook a meal they know how to take selfies and be offended and be in mindless groups
[56:10.480 --> 56:26.480]  and then as social justice warriors like the guy that tried to physically attack Donald Trump that said he wanted to kill him he went to the rally with a bunch of young women he was their big hero hit the big man who's going to stop free speech
[56:26.480 --> 56:41.480]  because he's such a liberal he's going to try to attack Donald Trump and they have this weird nilly guy on CNN as a hero CNN gives airtime to guy who admitted he wanted to murder Trump and reportedly put out jihad tweets and stuff
[56:41.480 --> 56:56.480]  and I saw in Kurt Nemo's article it showed all these Muslim groups there running over people and stuff and and this is what they do and then when the cops show up when the cops showed up at the abortion clinic I'm going to go back out there soon
[56:56.480 --> 57:08.480]  they tell the cops oh Alex Jones attacked us and then the cops come over we show the cops the footage they okay put them in handcuffs but then their bosses tell them don't take them to jail
[57:08.480 --> 57:17.480]  and these are people on boards at UT that are going to be on the police review board and the police won't even do their job with people like this
[57:17.480 --> 57:28.480]  and the founder of Black Lives Matter lives in Cuba and is a cop killer and again the left loves police given patriots tickets all day and raising revenue
[57:28.480 --> 57:38.480]  but when they're done with their takeover they're coming after you too because there's a lawlessness to these people they want to overthrow their revolutionaries
[57:38.480 --> 57:45.480]  if you're a TV viewer you can see this radio listeners go to info wars dot com forward slash show to see the free feed
[57:45.480 --> 57:54.480]  here's a clip of last year where again they link arms run into us they also ran into folks on crutches you name it go ahead and play the audio too here it is
[57:54.480 --> 58:04.480]  and the very people who want to literally wipe out black Americans through Planned Parenthood on record are the ones trying to create this whole race war and garbage
[58:04.480 --> 58:12.480]  off some of these tragedies we're pointing out the real organized genocide with the documented proof we're talking to a lot of great folks sir give us your take on all this
[58:12.480 --> 58:24.480]  yeah I think that we're going to continue forward as a country and we need to...
[58:24.480 --> 58:31.480]  now this happened five or six times this was just one time when they were running to you from behind with their arms linked and then if you push back
[58:31.480 --> 58:37.480]  they say on the news you attacked them they're now doing it to Trump's campaign head we're going to cover that when we come back in 70 seconds
[58:37.480 --> 58:45.480]  the campaign head the woman brushes into him she told the news she fell down and he attacked her with Megan Kelly
[58:45.480 --> 58:52.480]  lying packs of enemy filth tell folks how you got introduced to super male and then when super female came out tell us what happened
[58:52.480 --> 58:57.480]  after I saw such a huge positive change in my husband I had to try it for myself

[59:59.480 --> 01:00:06.480]  another
[01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:11.480]  another time
[01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:15.480]  the age of wonder
[01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:18.480]  another
[01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:21.480]  another time
[01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:29.480]  you are receiving this transmission
[01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:35.480]  you are the resistance live from Austin Texas broadcasting
[01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:42.480]  it's Alex John
[01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:48.480]  we have some videos that Josh Owens is shot on the campaign trail
[01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:58.480]  we'll have Richard and him reporting obviously Wednesday with the next big primary on the nightly news but also here on the radio TV transmission 11am to 3pm
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:09.480]  but there's very powerful footage that Owens is just out there shooting where the black lives matter folks who aren't hired thugs
[01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:15.480]  they're just hired to then get reasonable people to buy into it to show up it's a snowball effect
[01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:25.480]  you know when the Trump supporters actually hug and embrace the folks they go from looking like they're angry and want to fight
[01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:33.480]  you know to just you know really getting along and being very loving and that's what's going to defeat the new world order
[01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:42.480]  that's why Hillary's trying to basically scapegoat and set up Bernie Sanders people so that he gets demonized for shutting down free speech and I'm not defending Sanders
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:47.480]  they move on, sorrows, they take responsibility, they're running the whole thing
[01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:53.480]  and these black lives matter folks cannot believe that people want to shake their hands and don't hate them
[01:01:53.480 --> 01:02:02.480]  because I personally know black people that are friends of mine and also acquaintances who years ago said I'm not going to a tea party meeting
[01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:08.480]  those are a bunch of racists and I just go listen that's a media paradigm they go I don't see any black people there
[01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:17.480]  maybe a few I go yeah because people don't feel comfortable that's the whole divide and conquer point
[01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:27.480]  I have a really good Hispanic friend going back I don't know it's got to be 20 years and this guy has made millions of dollars in business
[01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:36.480]  he's a really smart guy and I'm not going to get into his business or what he does because he's actually known on the show just a little bit
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:44.480]  and I mean this is probably like ten years ago in a middle class neighborhood not a fancy four bedroom house
[01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:51.480]  lower middle class neighborhood where I was living at the time I had to move into a place with a gate and stuff because of some of the security issues
[01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:58.480]  and we're pulling up this idyllic leave it to beaver neighborhood and there was just like old people and stuff out doing their yards
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:03.480]  and he's like oh this neighborhood is so white you think they're not going to like me and I'm like you got to be joking man
[01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:09.480]  I'm not Hispanic in the neighborhood black people you name it but I'm telling you it's a mind game it's like when I was 12
[01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:16.480]  and was invited by high schoolers to go to a party and I felt insecure while folks were sitting around drinking beer
[01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:23.480]  and then just as soon as I got into it and started dancing and having fun it was great and it's meant to make everybody uncomfortable
[01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:30.480]  and they focus in on the black races they focus on the white races to make us all think that's how it works and that's just not it
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:42.480]  such a powerful video up on info wars dot com this is what MSM is hiding at Trump rallies it only has 81,000 views
[01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:49.480]  now he's got other videos up there with a half million or more from this weekend which is fine this is the one that needs millions of views
[01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:59.480]  in fact I think I'm going to take it do commentary on it and then maybe put it back out and then tie it into some of the other things that are happening
[01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:12.480]  because it ends the mindlessness when we actually get together and that's why they have the leaders of these groups come in who are the controllers
[01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:19.480]  they'll have the useful idiots with them they'll link hands and then they'll just ram them into people come on let's get these races let's stop them
[01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:28.480]  let's stand up then there's a melee then once the news comes out they claim the Trump people are attacking
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:34.480]  this is how they try to shut down free speech and the Washington Post was out yesterday saying should Donald Trump be fined should he be arrested
[01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:41.480]  could he be sued because of what he's saying is causing this so you have free speech you say something someone comes and attacks you it's your fault
[01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:53.480]  that's what they've already gotten placed in Europe now I'm going to come back and get into one of these operatives claiming that the Trump campaign manager ran into her
[01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:58.480]  and you look at the video he just brushed past her
[01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:34.480]  the criminal aliens released by ICE in these years who had already been convicted of thousands of crimes are responsible for a significant crime spree in American communities including 124 homicides
[01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:45.480]  inexplicably ICE is choosing to release some criminal aliens multiple times John Kasich in Thursday's CNN debate who said he would enact his largest amnesty in US history within his first 100 days in office
[01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:53.480]  here's a man barely hanging on to his political life who wants to offer amnesty for people who came here illegally and some of which have proven to be homicidal maniacs
[01:05:53.480 --> 01:06:19.480]  thank god we still have the second amendment rob do reporting for info wars dot com and info wars nightly news
[01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:48.480]  I personally encounter this on SWAT with antroplex antroplex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body
[01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:57.480]  discover why antroplex has turned so many heads today it's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at info wars life dot com with antroplex
[01:06:57.480 --> 01:07:18.480]  brain force it's completely different try a bottle of it rob do joins us you worked I guess like 20 plus hours tell us what brain force did I've been working all day I took a couple hours off coaching basketball I get in here at 830 I was kind of run down you know I just didn't feel like I was going to make it and I really wanted to do a good job on the interview
[01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:30.480]  I got my bottle of brain force right there pop two of them and about 20 minutes later it's like being everything just kind of clears up four and a half stars people really love it read about it find out why third party
[01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:57.480]  pharmaceutical sites give it such high praise because it really does have the best organic based systems that will blow your socks off I haven't pulled it all night or like that in a while but I probably could not have done it without brain force I went home about 645 this morning took three hours of sleep got up took two more brain force and came in you will find brain force and other game changing products at info wars life dot com or call 888-253-3139
[01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:21.480]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man Thomas Jefferson it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:48.480]  Welcome back to the second hour the consummate Trump insider Roger Stone gives us weekly updates is going to be popping in with huge breaking news on an upcoming sex scandal and Ted Cruz and a lot more also it's Hillary and the Soros group funding the Black Lives Matter attacks in Chicago and other areas to frame Sanders and of course the supporters are so stupid they don't even know that they're getting funding from the same place that's coming up
[01:08:48.480 --> 01:09:07.480]  we'll also take calls in the third hour today Matt Dubiel who you can see on screen if you're watching TV will be joining us here in just a few minutes but recapping and getting into some of the Trump news I haven't covered CNN gives airtime to guy who admitted he wanted to murder Trump
[01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:24.480]  Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders accused Donald Trump of inciting violence even as the Soros funded group takes credit that's how dumb they think you are and I want to cover this with Matt after we talk about Chicago must see new video info wars dot com did
[01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:42.480]  Michelle fields file false charges against Trump campaign manager and people heard about this the last weekend huge news you know not only does Trump hate black people in Hispanics and keep children in you know basements and eat them like the wicked witch in Hansel and Gretel
[01:09:42.480 --> 01:10:01.480]  he also has his campaign manager beat up women and the savior though is Megan Kelly and Fox News that says they're not going to go with with the basically Democrats now in that suite of them there is so much trouble now they can't even pose like they're conservative or patriots
[01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:17.480]  well now we have the footage slowed down we're going to play it we're going to describe it for radio listeners this is the incident she's talking about she didn't know it got caught on tape he's following Donald Trump to the crowd of reporters he brushes past her
[01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:32.480]  she smiles does says nothing and this is him brutally throwing her to the ground and I'm telling you folks I have dealt with this I have dealt with it.
[01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:51.480]  In this case, it's sealed. I can't get into it's type of stuff we deal with behind the scenes, where it was brought up in court that I assaulted the communist. The live stream went out that day. I was there I did nothing they linked hands they ran into us.
[01:10:51.480 --> 01:11:03.480]  And this is what they do and when they do this to cops in other areas, the cops get in trouble and the feds come in and arrest them and I'm not defending the cops here in every case but compared to these people give me a break.
[01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:14.480]  I mean it's incredible in fact back it up 20 seconds match me with us the bottom of the hour but this all fits together back it up with audio for radio listeners for TV viewers you can obviously see it for radio listeners they did this four or five times.
[01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:24.480]  They would link hands were just out there in an abortion clinic on the side of the street doing nothing. They would link hands, and then just run into us and actually knock people over.
[01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:29.480]  And then, and then, and then I'm in court.
[01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:35.480]  And I'm literally being shown this asking why I salted them I mean this is this country is upside down.
[01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:45.480]  Let's back it up. Let's back it up. Let's back it up 30 seconds so you can see them come run into us and then yet.
[01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:47.480]  These people give me a break.
[01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:55.480]  I mean it's incredible back it up 20 seconds match me with us the bottom of the hour but this all fits together back it up with audio for radio listeners for TV viewers.
[01:11:55.480 --> 01:12:01.480]  I've never heard this happen before it's really weird I just got a feed of myself 20 seconds ago through my ears.
[01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:06.480]  We're going to try it one more time because I want TV viewers everybody to see this as they link arms and run into us.
[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:09.480]  Let's back it up and see this one more time here it is.
[01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:12.480]  Organized genocide with the documented proof.
[01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:15.480]  We're talking a lot of great folks sir give us your take on all this.
[01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:19.480]  Yeah, I think that we're going to continue forward as a country.
[01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:31.480]  We need to.
[01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:35.480]  Now I'm going to loop that again for folks from the beginning where they link arms and run into us.
[01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:45.480]  This is what they do and then from Chicago to you know places in Ohio to Austin Texas when they run into you.
[01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:50.480]  Then they come after you to the police.
[01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:55.480]  The very people who want to literally wipe out black Americans.
[01:12:55.480 --> 01:12:59.480]  We're just out there standing on the grass on government right of ways.
[01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:05.480]  Public property being peaceful talking to folks and we get attacked I want to go to Matt.
[01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:16.480]  Dubiel is the vice president and general manager of WCKG radio in Chicago and of course he's made national headlines when they had his three year old son.
[01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:30.480]  Going to the TSA scrutiny that makes when people angry WCKG carries our broadcast several hours a day we've been on for four or five years 1530 WCKG dot com 1530 WCKG dot com.
[01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:37.480]  Folks all over Chicago list of this fine station so even if you don't live in Chicago call your friends your family your neighbors folks you know.
[01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:45.480]  Former coworkers and tell them tune in today to find the truth and you can also subscribe to the channel and get their podcast and more.
[01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:55.480]  So Matt we've set the table here with just an example of the type of stuff that's going on where they literally think they're allowed to climb on stage and try to attack Donald Trump.
[01:13:55.480 --> 01:14:01.480]  They're allowed to attack us or try to knock a guy over you know in front of us on crutches that can hardly walk.
[01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:10.480]  They target people in wheelchairs and then they say it's our first amendment fault and the Washington Post says can Trump be held responsible.
[01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:19.480]  You've got a lot of videos on your Facebook page we're going to put that up in a moment and play some of those but you were there last week what really happened in Chicago.
[01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:28.480]  It's interesting because what we're hearing about isn't what what was going on there first off this place was heavily protected by police to begin with.
[01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:36.480]  And what I saw were Americans there these Trump supporters that were there I didn't go to by the way I didn't go to support Trump I went there to cover this event.
[01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:43.480]  I went with my wife we were in the press pit but there's two interesting things you need to know that you're not hearing number one is about the press pit.
[01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:53.480]  And what the press pit says about the people at the event but that they don't even know about what they're saying about Americans in the press pit would blow your mind and I'll share that with you.
[01:14:53.480 --> 01:15:03.480]  But when we looked around what we saw was veterans there were people in wheelchairs there were and you're looking at some of my footage before the melee happened.
[01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:17.480]  And you see just a cross section of middle America and you see guys with their kids and families and and little kids in fact we almost brought my sons with and thank God that we didn't because when things turned.
[01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:29.480]  I was panicked in here because you know and you've been in these situations before where when something flips and it becomes a tinderbox and you know you got to get out of there.
[01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:39.480]  And I am sure that some people think that I sound like the biggest pansy of all time and if I were by myself there I probably would have felt less concerned.
[01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:46.480]  But I had my wife there the mother of my children and we almost brought our kids and all I'm thinking about is there's people here with their children.
[01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:53.480]  And this is the environment it was by the way you just showed a clip of a man a white guy and a black guy swinging at each other.
[01:15:53.480 --> 01:16:00.480]  The the the white guy there was a Trump supporter he was a little unruly he was he was out of his mind there.
[01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:06.480]  The guy the gentleman the black gentleman there is the man that was on the stage that took over for Trump's.
[01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:12.480]  He took over the stage and he was interviewed in the news afterwards and they talked about how he was peaceful.
[01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:18.480]  And then as they were summarizing how he was so peaceful they showed the footage of him and another guy swing in at each other.
[01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:26.480]  That's not peaceful. That's not OK. Both sides shouldn't be doing that. And this is what they're not really talking about at that event.
[01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:34.480]  It was a peaceful event until the moment when they announced that it was canceled or postponed for safety concerns.
[01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:42.480]  And then you saw all the people that were in the crowd that were virtually sleeper cells. And I don't want to use that term because I know that they were.
[01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:48.480]  No that's what it is. They're hired by George Soros. He's taking credit. Hillary and they're blaming Sanders. It's incredible.
[01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:54.480]  They had paid him to do it. They're under orders. They're mercenaries and they go in and they do this.
[01:16:54.480 --> 01:17:01.480]  And as soon as they knew that happened OK now we're not going to disrupt Trump. Now we're going to activate because our threats work to shut it down.
[01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:08.480]  And now we're going to cause a melee so they could run headlines saying the most dangerous place to be in the world is a Trump rally for a chilling effect.
[01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:15.480]  It was it was unbelievable. So the minute they announced we go from this event which by the way I took footage and it wasn't filled yet.
[01:17:15.480 --> 01:17:21.480]  And the reason why it wasn't filled was because everybody that's coming through they have to you know want you. They have the Secret Service at the front.
[01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:31.480]  We went through the press gates. So it was a little bit of a fast track obviously. But they're they're testing and they're checking everyone for explosives or you know weapons whatever.
[01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:39.480]  And so this room is not filling up as fast as I expected. And I took footage of that. So it was it was very vacant in the beginning.
[01:17:39.480 --> 01:17:48.480]  It filled up and filled up. And then we started looking around and I noticed firsthand that these people are in the front pit area that are close to the stage.
[01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:57.480]  And I'm looking at myself and I'm looking at my wife and I'm saying to myself you know this these people don't seem like your typical Trump reporters or supporters.
[01:17:57.480 --> 01:18:06.480]  They were under 30. They were a lot of them were looked like they might have been Middle Eastern or college students.
[01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:13.480]  It's not what you typically see. And so as a white guy I go like well check yourself. It's not only white people that support Trump.
[01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:22.480]  Let's see what happens. Sure enough when they made that announcement those were the people that erupted and began turning that event upside down.
[01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:31.480]  Later come to find out that this group S. E. I. U. which is some union group organization funded with some taxpayer money in Chicago had a rally beforehand.
[01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:37.480]  They partnered with Black Lives Matter. They partnered with move on dot org. Kurt Nemo had an article on Friday about this.
[01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:42.480]  I forget the headline but it was a Kurt Nemo story about what I think it was what they're not telling you about Chicago.
[01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:51.480]  I think was the headline and it shows the people wearing the t-shirt saying you know Muslims against Trump and there's video where these people are running into people.
[01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:58.480]  So again this is what the left does. They run into you. They try to knock you over. They seem to target handicapped folks.
[01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:03.480]  That's because they're such cowards. I guess they're getting paid to attack people. So they want to attack an old lady or somebody in a wheelchair.
[01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:09.480]  Let me tell you I see somebody attacking somebody in a wheelchair. We're going to stand up against you and we did push the Communist back.
[01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:15.480]  We did stand up for ourselves and in America that's illegal. You're supposed to let them attack you Matt.
[01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:23.480]  What people have to understand about freedom of speech is it doesn't give you freedom from consequences number one and number two.
[01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:31.480]  You can't go to a private event and shout free speech. You want to have free speech. You want to have an event like Donald's hold your own event.
[01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:39.480]  You want to reach an audience like Alex's start your own network. You want to reach people do it on your Twitter feed but you do not have perfect socialism.
[01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:46.480]  It's ruled by conquest. We're just going to take your event over. We're just going to take over government and vote ourselves bigger welfare checks.
[01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:57.480]  And again it's the multinational banks. They've dominated the country. They're the real welfare queens. So they're creating a substratum of dependent people who will erupt anytime they don't get their freebies.
[01:19:57.480 --> 01:20:03.480]  What do you overall think of the Trump phenomenon? Tell me the truth because I don't even know your views on this. I know you're a libertarian.
[01:20:03.480 --> 01:20:09.480]  Where do you see all this going? What do you think about all the other big political issues that are unfolding?
[01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:21.480]  I left that event Alex and and I was I was freaked out. I went there with my wife. We got my baby sitter for the kids. I left there and I thought oh man like we're in trouble.
[01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:28.480]  This country is in trouble and it's not Trump's fault and it's not Bernie's fault. It's eight years of this president that we had.
[01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:37.480]  And by the way, it's eight years of the president before him. It's it's just a shift here in the United States that I have put us in a bad situation.
[01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:46.480]  I got to tell you, I'm not necessarily for Trump. I'm not necessarily against Trump. But I will say the media in the media pit.
[01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:53.480]  They were making fun of the attendees. This is what people need to realize. OK, those aren't Trump supporters in that building.
[01:20:53.480 --> 01:21:04.480]  Those are American men and women. Some of those are veterans. Some of those are children. Those are American men and women who deserve the opportunity to vote to voice their choice.
[01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:15.480]  And by the way, so do the protesters the right way. And when we want to silence the other side, you know, freedom of speech shouldn't be mutually exclusive.
[01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:24.480]  I want to hear everyone talk. That's what I was about to say. Can you imagine when Obama was getting crowds not as big but close in 2007, 2008?
[01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:33.480]  If predominantly, you know, 200, 300 white people started showing up and then running into folks, it would be just all over the news.
[01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:39.480]  The end of the world. But because it's being done to somebody who's been branded as a white guy, it's allowed.
[01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:52.480]  And again, it's meant to scare people away, period from rallies, to scare them away from Trump, but to scare, quote, minorities away from the Tea Party, from conservatism, from libertarian thought.
[01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:59.480]  I mean, it is just truly, truly sickening. And being in the press all these years, I've seen the disdain.
[01:21:59.480 --> 01:22:09.480]  9 out of 10 people in the media, in newspapers, even in radio, TV, you name it, because you don't get jobs if you're not. Even though conservatism and libertarianism gets good ratings,
[01:22:09.480 --> 01:22:15.480]  the listenership's conservative all over the country, they got big money coming in to kick libertarians and patriots off the ear.
[01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:22.480]  I mean, it's serious. Big money comes in and says, you put these shows on, we'll advertise. It's sick because they want to stop the message.
[01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:30.480]  But you get in these pits and the disdain and the arrogance of the media, the hatred of what I'd call bitter clingers.
[01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:40.480]  It really is sick. It's a cult. So describe to us in the pit, with the types of press that were there, what type of comments you heard about the Trump supporters?
[01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:52.480]  It made me sad. It really did. And as I think about it now, I get really upset because the way they were talking, you could hear them, because you're in this tight, you're in this little cage,
[01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:59.480]  it's like you're in a chicken coop together and there's cameras and there's microphones, they're all in there. And these people are, not all of them, by the way,
[01:22:59.480 --> 01:23:06.480]  there's some people in there that, especially the old school journalists that are reporting, they're kind of monitoring what's going on.
[01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:13.480]  But the camera people, some of the reporters that were in there, and by the way, they're going to lambast me for saying this, but it's the truth.
[01:23:13.480 --> 01:23:20.480]  They were making fun of the people that were there. We sat there, my wife and I stood there in the pit and there was a secret service agent there.
[01:23:20.480 --> 01:23:30.480]  We talked with him for a little bit. Amazing guy. He didn't do that. He didn't know pine about, oh, Trump supporters are dumb or they're low information or they're this or they're that.
[01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:39.480]  He looks at it as, hey, listen, sometimes I'm on the Trump detail, sometimes I'm on the Bernie detail. All the time, I'm a secret service guy and we're in this pin,
[01:23:39.480 --> 01:23:48.480]  I represent my country and this is the political process. I want this to be the political process without the violence, without the shenanigans,
[01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:56.480]  but I want people to support Bernie and Hillary. That's what this is all about. And when we start getting to a point...
[01:23:56.480 --> 01:24:07.480]  I mean, it's their right to do it. I hope you don't want them to be supported. Matt, expanding on that, again, 1530, they're in Chicago folks, WCKG, looking at this.
[01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:11.480]  Were the comments just snarky or were they hateful?
[01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:16.480]  You know, that hate term is a dangerous term. They like to throw that around a lot these days.
[01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:19.480]  Okay. Well, how would you describe them? I mean, what type of stuff were they saying?
[01:24:19.480 --> 01:24:29.480]  They don't see people for people. They were talking about the people, like they put them in a group, just like people are doing with conservatives and liberals.
[01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:36.480]  And this is why I hate these labels. This is why I'm not a Republican and I'm not a Democrat. This is why I refuse to put one of those labels on myself,
[01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:45.480]  because when you do that, you allow everyone else to define you based on their frame of what that is. What is a Trump fan? What is a Trump protester?
[01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:51.480]  Sure, I have friends that are mad at me because I don't support, you know, Ted Cruz over Trump. I mean, I'm sorry.
[01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:57.480]  Ted Cruz does have the Bush's writing his campaign now. Ted Cruz came out and said, it's Trump's fault. There's violence.
[01:24:57.480 --> 01:25:04.480]  Well, and clearly that's not true. He lost a lot of police group support. He's got all these CFR connections, TPP connections.
[01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:10.480]  I like the guy a lot better than Hillary. I like his voting record in the Senate on a lot of things. I don't dislike him as a person.
[01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:18.480]  But clearly the Republican establishment doesn't want Donald Trump. What do you think that says about Trump, this Trump phenomenon?
[01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:22.480]  I mean, Matt, tell us at your gut level, what do you think about Trump?
[01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:29.480]  I think that all the things that people like about him are all the things that could make him scary later. And I understand that.
[01:25:29.480 --> 01:25:38.480]  I think that all the things that he's speaking about, look, you have to show everyone what the problem is if you want to say that there needs to be a solution.
[01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:44.480]  So here's a guy who's out there saying, we got some problems. We got to go after them. The old way doesn't work.
[01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:50.480]  And let's get to it. And so now the message gets attacked through that messenger, which is Donald Trump.
[01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:57.480]  If people don't like him, if people are going all to all this trouble to thwart him and then say it's because he's a racist.
[01:25:57.480 --> 01:26:02.480]  Those are the tactics that, you know, they'll say, oh, he's Hitler. That's what Hitler would have done.
[01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:05.480]  Hitler would have said Donald Trump is Hitler. Goebbels would have said.
[01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:16.480]  Well, that's my point is a man on a white horse is scary, but the elite itself is a oligarchy, a shapeless, formless group of bureaucrats and special interests.
[01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:22.480]  The fact that that monstrosity is scared of him really makes me want to support Trump.
[01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:26.480]  I mean, I agree with so much of what he stands for, so much of what he does.
[01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:30.480]  And at the same time, he says some things I disagree with as well.
[01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:36.480]  That's why I think it's important for patriots to be involved, to keep Trump honest, because look at the alternatives.
[01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:41.480]  Let me ask you this question. What else is on your radar screen? What else is concerning you?
[01:26:41.480 --> 01:26:47.480]  I saw an article that the murder rate had doubled in the last year in Chicago.
[01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:52.480]  I thought it had been going down some, but then I saw that headline Chicago Tribune.
[01:26:52.480 --> 01:26:59.480]  What is going on there? And where do you see, you know, this country going?
[01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:03.480]  I'll get some, I'll get some trolls and some snarky comments for this.
[01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:09.480]  But I mean, at this rate, you know, number one, you got to realize that while that event on Friday night was embarrassing,
[01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:14.480]  I was embarrassed to be in Chicago. I was embarrassed to be an American because of everyone's behavior there.
[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:18.480]  That said, it doesn't really represent Chicago.
[01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:23.480]  However, Chicago has got a lot of problems. The schools have problems.
[01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:29.480]  The murder rate has problems. You know, outside of Chicago, the suburbs we have that we live in a bubble here.
[01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:32.480]  The suburbs are very nice. They're very well taken care of.
[01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:37.480]  But Chicago is on the road to becoming Detroit if something doesn't change fast.
[01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:41.480]  People in Chicago are fed up with the way that things are going in Chicago.
[01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:42.480]  That's the bottom line.
[01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:48.480]  And the government's arrogant. It's a microcosm of California, which is a microcosm of the country that is a microcosm of the whole world.
[01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:53.480]  The elites just see red carpets and caviar and, you know, hookers and they're robbing everybody.
[01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:59.480]  And they don't understand that if the mega banks steal everything, there'll be nowhere to spend the money they've stolen.
[01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:07.480]  If the Democratic machine didn't fix Chicago for the last 50 years, if eight years of hope and change and,
[01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:15.480]  and yes, we can didn't change the country and eight years before that of George W. Bush didn't fix the country,
[01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:20.480]  I think it's time to start going, OK, what's different? How can we do something different?
[01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:24.480]  And I think that's why everyone thinks that people are so angry.
[01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:27.480]  There's passion and without passion, nothing's going to change.
[01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:32.480]  I mean, people that are in this country, that founded this country, got pretty passionate in the beginning.
[01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:38.480]  And without that passion, nonviolent passion, by the way, we're in deep trouble.
[01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:41.480]  I think that now is a critical juncture for us in this country.
[01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:43.480]  Absolutely. Look, look, the left is not the left.
[01:28:43.480 --> 01:28:50.480]  They're a group of control freak bullies in big city, Chicago type mafia writ large across the nation.
[01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:52.480]  They want to intimidate and shut down our speech.
[01:28:52.480 --> 01:28:58.480]  And the answer is, even if you don't support Trump, everybody should go to the Trump rallies as an observer
[01:28:58.480 --> 01:29:02.480]  and to support the First Amendment and to have your voice heard what whoever you're supporting.
[01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:09.480]  I mean, I really think the Bernie people are being manipulated by move on and others to become attack dogs against Trump
[01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:14.480]  instead of against Hillary because the Trump has been reaching out the Trump and the Trumpkins have
[01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:20.480]  and the Trumpkins have been reaching out to them saying, hey, we're true populace.
[01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:24.480]  Join us, Matt Dubey L 15 30 WCKG dot com.
[01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:26.480]  You're a great host in your own right.
[01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:28.480]  I'm glad you text message me this morning.

[01:30:15.480 --> 01:30:21.480]  Van Dam said he was aware of who is really shaping US presidential elections.
[01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:30.480]  Some of the other participants in the debate looks stunned as Van Dam continued to say that the Rothschilds rose to power in 1827.
[01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:34.480]  And they now control and dominate entire continents.
[01:30:34.480 --> 01:30:38.480]  And he says Donald Trump is not going to win the election.
[01:30:38.480 --> 01:30:44.480]  He went on to make a distinction between lobbyists that control the other candidates and people like Donald Trump,
[01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:47.480]  who is truly anti-establishment.

[01:32:09.480 --> 01:32:11.480]  But doing that, I know I'm going to have the highest quality.
[01:32:11.480 --> 01:32:20.480]  Super male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:32:20.480 --> 01:32:25.480]  We did the super male and the super female vitality, big changes, a lot of energy.
[01:32:25.480 --> 01:32:29.480]  We've gotten off the cheap energy drinks, energy shots, they've got a ton of money there.
[01:32:29.480 --> 01:32:37.480]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet and then concentrated, or maximum potency.
[01:32:37.480 --> 01:32:41.480]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff, just cover that up for a while,
[01:32:41.480 --> 01:32:47.480]  but then burn you out in my experience, whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source.
[01:32:47.480 --> 01:32:49.480]  So, it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[01:32:49.480 --> 01:33:08.480]  Visit infowarsalife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[01:33:08.480 --> 01:33:21.480]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:33:21.480 --> 01:33:28.480]  Look at these headlines. North Korea claims it could wipe out Manhattan with a hydrogen bomb.
[01:33:28.480 --> 01:33:37.480]  Just last week, they threatened to nuke the capital city of Seoul, South Korea.
[01:33:37.480 --> 01:33:43.480]  Here's the headline infowars.com, nuclear war with North Korea coming.
[01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:55.480]  Question mark. Russia just last week threatened a preemptive invasion and nuclear attack on North Korea.
[01:33:55.480 --> 01:34:00.480]  They don't stop threatening to launch preemptive nuclear strikes.
[01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:08.480]  Now, I said this at the very beginning of the broadcast today and I don't know what it is, but it always is bore out
[01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:14.480]  that my six cents for the months leading up to 9-11 was off the charts.
[01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:18.480]  And I said they'll probably blow up the World Trade Centers and blame it on Bin Laden.
[01:34:18.480 --> 01:34:22.480]  If you don't believe me, just go to YouTube and type it in. It's up there.
[01:34:22.480 --> 01:34:27.480]  There's a total two-hour show where I did it. I'm not bragging. I could see all the pre-programming, all the propaganda.
[01:34:27.480 --> 01:34:33.480]  It was very clear. They're like, here's Bin Laden. He's going to get you when he attacks. Give up all your rights.
[01:34:33.480 --> 01:34:39.480]  Under the World Trade Centers had asbestos. One of them was leaning. They were going to tear it down.
[01:34:39.480 --> 01:34:47.480]  I said, no, that was the globalist. The globalist already cooked the bomb, trained the driver, already hit it in 1992, 93.
[01:34:47.480 --> 01:34:54.480]  That was 93. And so, right as Bush was leaving office. And so, they'll probably hit it again and they'll probably blame it on him.
[01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:58.480]  And I could just see it all. I could feel it. It happened.
[01:34:58.480 --> 01:35:02.480]  Unless you believe I said it and they went, oh, that's a great idea. Let's do it.
[01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:06.480]  One thing to say on the day I said it before, and I'm not bragging.
[01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:10.480]  I got up on the morning Scalia died and I called Anthony. I called do. I called Buckley.
[01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:13.480]  And I said, I want you to come into the office. We were here about $7, $8.
[01:35:13.480 --> 01:35:18.480]  Well, I was walking around the table sweating saying big stuff's about to happen.
[01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:24.480]  Scalia death is a sign of a chain reaction. I wasn't freaking out at a gut level over that.
[01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:29.480]  I was picking up the movement and the threat to the rest of the government that was legitimate.
[01:35:29.480 --> 01:35:33.480]  That this really means we're going into a new level of tyranny.
[01:35:33.480 --> 01:35:39.480]  Now, this has been going on all morning and some people in the office say, hey, just ignore it.
[01:35:39.480 --> 01:35:42.480]  You know, don't feed the trolls. No, no, it's not about feeding the trolls.
[01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:48.480]  It's about documenting attacks on free speech where they say they want to arrest in the Washington Post
[01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:54.480]  or fine or sue Donald Trump because he's making George Soros and Hillary fund groups
[01:35:54.480 --> 01:35:59.480]  that come in and run over people in wheelchairs and hold their hands together and say, you know,
[01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:02.480]  excuse me, coming through and starting fights.
[01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:06.480]  So the bully's trying to end our free speech. They're the heroes.
[01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:13.480]  And then anybody who has a first amendment, it's their fault.
[01:36:13.480 --> 01:36:18.480]  RIT people and we've got big companies that run it say it's the biggest denial of service attack
[01:36:18.480 --> 01:36:23.480]  that enforcers have ever seen and that it was be as big as the ones they hit Google with
[01:36:23.480 --> 01:36:27.480]  or they hit like Apple with. It's a major industrial attack.
[01:36:27.480 --> 01:36:31.480]  This is why and if I say this, they'll probably target the other one too. Fine.
[01:36:31.480 --> 01:36:36.480]  That which doesn't tell us only makes it stronger. Our listeners will hear this and will respond
[01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:40.480]  no matter what to keep us going and operating.
[01:36:40.480 --> 01:36:44.480]  We have two high tech shopping carts. We have the old one that's been updated,
[01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:47.480]  but that we are slowly phasing out, but it's linked all over Google.
[01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:51.480]  It's still where we get the majority of our traffic and support.
[01:36:51.480 --> 01:36:55.480]  The one that our regular listeners go to is info or store.com.
[01:36:55.480 --> 01:36:59.480]  That's not the one being hit. Anthony described the one that is being hit.
[01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:03.480]  I'm not a mega tech expert or anything, but I did just speak to some of the biggest experts
[01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:06.480]  out there that are hosting the info or servers and stuff.
[01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:11.480]  It looks like store.infowars.com right now is being hit with a DDOS,
[01:37:11.480 --> 01:37:15.480]  a direct denial of service attack, which is basically where most cases,
[01:37:15.480 --> 01:37:19.480]  they get in control of other people's computers or they use like a big thick fiber
[01:37:19.480 --> 01:37:22.480]  and they just blast your website. Zombie attack.
[01:37:22.480 --> 01:37:27.480]  Zombie attack and this one is super big. It's as big as one that would take down Apple
[01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:31.480]  or anything like that. So we have tons of fail safes going on and I spoke to them
[01:37:31.480 --> 01:37:35.480]  for a minute back there before I came on to talk about this other stuff and they said,
[01:37:35.480 --> 01:37:38.480]  yeah, this is really big. We're probably not going to be able to sustain it for much longer.
[01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:41.480]  We're going to go to fail safes over and over again, but I mean,
[01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:45.480]  it looks like a really, really concerted effort. It's been happening for hours and hours and hours.
[01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:50.480]  Absolutely. So again, this is their attempt. This is the old site that's linked all over Google,
[01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:55.480]  all over everywhere. It is where we get one of our main funding sources from the biggest.
[01:37:55.480 --> 01:37:59.480]  So again, they're attacking directly at the oxygen supply of Info Wars,
[01:37:59.480 --> 01:38:03.480]  directly at your First Amendment. You see where all this goes.
[01:38:03.480 --> 01:38:08.480]  And so the answer is go to infowarstore.com and take advantage of some of the biggest sales
[01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:13.480]  we've ever had running right now. And then of course, if they were to shut everything down forever,
[01:38:13.480 --> 01:38:17.480]  we'll just go to phones and go to donations and people, I bet we'll bring in even more money
[01:38:17.480 --> 01:38:21.480]  just with pure donations. How about that? And then you're going to have to come actually set me up
[01:38:21.480 --> 01:38:25.480]  or arrest me, see, because we're not just going to feel sorry for ourselves like victims.
[01:38:25.480 --> 01:38:31.480]  People love to get attacked and then quit. I'm done. I got attacked. I got hacked.
[01:38:31.480 --> 01:38:35.480]  I got demonized. I was in a thousand newspapers yesterday being lied about.
[01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:39.480]  People come in, they go, man, I saw you in the front page of the paper, what they said about you,
[01:38:39.480 --> 01:38:43.480]  how you take it. And I go, man, I'm taking it great. I want to fight these anti-human traders.
[01:38:43.480 --> 01:38:49.480]  I love it. Man, this is great. Get the champagne, baby. Get it?
[01:38:49.480 --> 01:38:53.480]  Because I came here to fight. I'm not playing games.
[01:38:53.480 --> 01:38:59.480]  Don't you get it? I'm committed. And so again, we've got the biggest sale ever
[01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:05.480]  on high quality, storeable foods at infowarslife.com and infowarsstore.com.
[01:39:05.480 --> 01:39:13.480]  Infowarslife.com is a sub directory into that. And you can simply go there and you can get 30 to 40%
[01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:19.480]  off right now on infowarsstore.com on all infowars, select super high quality, storeable foods.
[01:39:19.480 --> 01:39:25.480]  These are super high quality, last 25 years, made right here in America by great patriots,
[01:39:25.480 --> 01:39:29.480]  powered by my patriot supply. We have my patriot supply products, the exact same food right next to it.
[01:39:29.480 --> 01:39:35.480]  Package at the same time is different label. I'm able contractually to basically get out of my profit
[01:39:35.480 --> 01:39:39.480]  to undercut everyone and then become the market leader.
[01:39:39.480 --> 01:39:43.480]  And that's what loss leaders are about. We make about 10% when we go this low.
[01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:47.480]  So administratively, we're pretty much losing money after taxes and regulations.
[01:39:47.480 --> 01:39:55.480]  We only do this a few times a year, 24 hour flash sale, infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com.
[01:39:55.480 --> 01:39:59.480]  And infowarsstore is not getting hit. They're hitting the store that still gets the most traffic.
[01:39:59.480 --> 01:40:05.480]  And our answer is we're already building a third site separately.
[01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:09.480]  And that's why I do this is the attacks over the years. So we will be launching not just the third now,
[01:40:09.480 --> 01:40:14.480]  but a fourth. Because my rule is in operation Hydra, and we're not a bad Hydra.
[01:40:14.480 --> 01:40:20.480]  We're a good Hydra, but we learn from the enemy that when you cut one head off, two more sprout.
[01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:24.480]  See how that works? And of course that comes back to victory as well.
[01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:31.480]  Cut one off, two more come back out. See that? Cut one off, two more.
[01:40:31.480 --> 01:40:36.480]  Cut two off, four. Cut five off, 10 come back. Do the math.
[01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:40.480]  Plus this is such an old school tactic to attack someone and try to get their website down.
[01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:44.480]  Don't they understand? It's going to come on air and people are going to support infowars more.
[01:40:44.480 --> 01:40:46.480]  They're going to go to the store. They're going to want to see it for themselves.
[01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:49.480]  And they're going to want to fight back. Like this is such an old school technique.
[01:40:49.480 --> 01:40:54.480]  That's right. In fact, I want to put the PayPal on the front page when Watson writes an article about this.
[01:40:54.480 --> 01:41:01.480]  And I just want to see, you know, folks that want to just flat out donate to us so we can have more reporters,
[01:41:01.480 --> 01:41:05.480]  more writers, do more, more people in the field. I mean, they hate what we're doing.
[01:41:05.480 --> 01:41:08.480]  They hate the exponential growth. When I go look at our graphs, they're all just straight up,
[01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:12.480]  and it really freaks the system out. So take advantage of a bunch of great specials.
[01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:15.480]  Supermail Vitality is back in stock. Anthroplex is back in stock.
[01:41:15.480 --> 01:41:18.480]  Get Brainforce, the best Neutropic out there.
[01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:22.480]  They're a bunch of leading competitors that are $60 to $80 a bottle.
[01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:25.480]  I was in a store the other day and ran into a listener.
[01:41:25.480 --> 01:41:29.480]  And behind their counter, they had one of the other big brands that's $70.
[01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:33.480]  The same amount of pills, but just a bigger bottle.
[01:41:33.480 --> 01:41:36.480]  Some of the same ingredients, but ours are better and has more on top of it.
[01:41:36.480 --> 01:41:38.480]  I'm not competing. I just can't believe.
[01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:43.480]  And I said to them, I said, wow, you know, they target folks by something being too much,
[01:41:43.480 --> 01:41:47.480]  because then people think it must be the best. We have something better.
[01:41:47.480 --> 01:41:53.480]  Some of the same ingredients, but even better ingredients added for literally less than half the price.
[01:41:53.480 --> 01:41:57.480]  And the woman goes, yeah, I know, I tend to buy whatever I think is the most expensive.
[01:41:57.480 --> 01:42:00.480]  No folks, I morally can't do that.
[01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:03.480]  And I don't blame the radio network having some ads that I don't agree with,
[01:42:03.480 --> 01:42:07.480]  because that's just how radio is, but I sit here and get mad every time I hear some of them.
[01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:10.480]  Okay, I mean, I'm going to be honest. Its superstition is really what it is.
[01:42:10.480 --> 01:42:13.480]  It's not even superstition. It's six cents. It's my gut.
[01:42:13.480 --> 01:42:18.480]  It's not that I'm sociopathic. And so I know the laws of nature.
[01:42:18.480 --> 01:42:21.480]  I don't want to screw people over. I already feel like that in my DNA.
[01:42:21.480 --> 01:42:25.480]  I'm a good, loving person. But at the same time, just in business,
[01:42:25.480 --> 01:42:28.480]  it's not good to screw people over. It's not good to give, you know,
[01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:31.480]  I mean, we make a profit around the operation. We're into capitalism,
[01:42:31.480 --> 01:42:36.480]  but I just don't get, it's like that millionaire app they had a few years ago, or billionaire app,
[01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:40.480]  and people would go out and get it, even though it cost thousands of dollars, did nothing to say,
[01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:44.480]  look, I've got the billionaire app. Hey, look, remember when that vitamin guy came over here,
[01:42:44.480 --> 01:42:48.480]  one of the biggest vitamin manufacturers, and he said, look, behind the scenes, we're talking about this.
[01:42:48.480 --> 01:42:52.480]  I think we brought this up maybe once. If people knew the full story, he said, hey,
[01:42:52.480 --> 01:42:55.480]  why don't you mark your stuff up like three or four more times?
[01:42:55.480 --> 01:42:58.480]  That's what all the other stores are doing. You could make so much more profits.
[01:42:58.480 --> 01:43:01.480]  You could make 200%. You got to mark it up over and over again. You go to Whole Foods.
[01:43:01.480 --> 01:43:05.480]  Why do you put such fancy stuff in your, yeah, but if you go to Whole Foods,
[01:43:05.480 --> 01:43:08.480]  something like Brain Force or something like SuperMail, God, it would be three,
[01:43:08.480 --> 01:43:12.480]  four times X because you have to put that in when you put it into the brick and mortar stores.
[01:43:12.480 --> 01:43:16.480]  But he was also telling us they would just sweep up the floors like the herbs
[01:43:16.480 --> 01:43:19.480]  and fall off the floors from the conveyor belt. Not the guy we used.
[01:43:19.480 --> 01:43:22.480]  He was talking about other companies that we're not going to name.
[01:43:22.480 --> 01:43:26.480]  They would just sweep the floors with herbs that fell off the conveyor belt
[01:43:26.480 --> 01:43:29.480]  and just throw it back on the belt. They don't care.
[01:43:29.480 --> 01:43:33.480]  Meanwhile, we have three companies, one of them group, that is so neurotic about having everything
[01:43:33.480 --> 01:43:38.480]  be California standard, totally clean, totally organic, flipping out
[01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:41.480]  that half the time we don't have products because we just can't make them perfect.
[01:43:41.480 --> 01:43:42.480]  True.
[01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:46.480]  And I'll be honest. I've said, listen, we can be the best, but we need to have the product
[01:43:46.480 --> 01:43:49.480]  and be the best of the point to have the product, but these companies are so good.
[01:43:49.480 --> 01:43:55.480]  They go, no. So I have quite frankly, cult level groups.
[01:43:55.480 --> 01:43:58.480]  I want to say cult. I mean, like cult film, cult.
[01:43:58.480 --> 01:43:59.480]  It's true.
[01:43:59.480 --> 01:44:01.480]  Just obsessed with giving you the best quality. And it's true.
[01:44:01.480 --> 01:44:03.480]  So no brag, just fact.
[01:44:03.480 --> 01:44:08.480]  Infowarslife.com. Infowarsstore.com. It is amazing.

[01:44:33.480 --> 01:44:36.480]  Now again, you notice we always plug. You're the listeners.
[01:44:36.480 --> 01:44:37.480]  We always plug.
[01:44:37.480 --> 01:44:41.480]  And we weren't going to plug, by the way, until there was a mega attack on the store
[01:44:41.480 --> 01:44:42.480]  that was big enough to get out.
[01:44:42.480 --> 01:44:43.480]  Yeah. And we're not going to let them win.
[01:44:43.480 --> 01:44:45.480]  And we wanted you to know this, that it really,
[01:44:45.480 --> 01:44:47.480]  they're trying to keep us free speech from getting out.
[01:44:47.480 --> 01:44:50.480]  They're trying to keep the fuel from being loaded in our engines
[01:44:50.480 --> 01:44:54.480]  so we can get off the ground as B-52s with huge loads of weaponry,
[01:44:54.480 --> 01:45:00.480]  of truth that we're going to fly over globalist operations and hammer them to Hades.
[01:45:00.480 --> 01:45:03.480]  Now, we'll get into the reason you came in here.
[01:45:03.480 --> 01:45:07.480]  But I want to get Watson or whoever to write a story about this immediately
[01:45:07.480 --> 01:45:14.480]  because folks need to know this is happening and this is going on in a big way.
[01:45:14.480 --> 01:45:18.480]  Now, the reason I got you in here is we've had Dr. Blaylock on.
[01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:26.480]  We've also had the famous vaccine doctor that lives here in Austin, Texas,
[01:45:26.480 --> 01:45:27.480]  in talking about it.
[01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:30.480]  That's what his research all showed, Dr. Wakefield,
[01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:32.480]  who his partner's now been cleared in England.
[01:45:32.480 --> 01:45:34.480]  He's suing and trying to be cleared.
[01:45:34.480 --> 01:45:38.480]  It turns out that the research papers saying that he defrauded everybody wasn't true
[01:45:38.480 --> 01:45:41.480]  and that they knew that there were two different British studies that were secret
[01:45:41.480 --> 01:45:45.480]  a decade before his on gut flora and vaccines.
[01:45:45.480 --> 01:45:48.480]  So what he found was such good research,
[01:45:48.480 --> 01:45:52.480]  that's why they had that whole funded Eli Lilly hoax and all that,
[01:45:52.480 --> 01:45:54.480]  that he'd been proven to be a liar.
[01:45:54.480 --> 01:45:56.480]  None of it was true.
[01:45:56.480 --> 01:45:58.480]  But here it is, folks.
[01:45:58.480 --> 01:46:01.480]  This is from Bloomberg Business.
[01:46:01.480 --> 01:46:05.480]  How gut bacteria are shaking up cancer research.
[01:46:05.480 --> 01:46:11.480]  Top scientists, Roche Holding, A.G. and Zastra Zennica,
[01:46:11.480 --> 01:46:15.480]  are seizing up potential allies in the fight against cancer.
[01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:18.480]  The trillions of bacteria that live in the human body.
[01:46:18.480 --> 01:46:20.480]  And then they go on to say, five years ago,
[01:46:20.480 --> 01:46:23.480]  if you asked me about bacteria and your gut playing an important role
[01:46:23.480 --> 01:46:26.480]  in your systemic immune response, I probably would have laughed it off.
[01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:30.480]  Daniel Chen, head of the cancer immunotherapy research
[01:46:30.480 --> 01:46:34.480]  at the Roche's Genitech division,
[01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:37.480]  said in a phone interview, and they just go through the whole thing that,
[01:46:37.480 --> 01:46:41.480]  oh my God, cancer, oh my God, autism, oh my God, all of it,
[01:46:41.480 --> 01:46:42.480]  it's all happening in the gut.
[01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:47.480]  These kids have such toxic bacteria and such toxic yeast
[01:46:47.480 --> 01:46:52.480]  and other garbage and fungus in their guts that's allowed
[01:46:52.480 --> 01:46:54.480]  because the flora that the GMO causes.
[01:46:54.480 --> 01:46:57.480]  And then the vaccines grow in that as well,
[01:46:57.480 --> 01:47:00.480]  that they're bombed out of their brain all the time,
[01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:02.480]  literally like they're on drugs.
[01:47:02.480 --> 01:47:05.480]  And that's what, it's time to get Wakefield in here, he said.
[01:47:05.480 --> 01:47:07.480]  We have the British studies too, but here they are now in Bloomberg,
[01:47:07.480 --> 01:47:10.480]  acting like they just discovered this.
[01:47:10.480 --> 01:47:12.480]  And so I was going back to my research, I was saying,
[01:47:12.480 --> 01:47:16.480]  what does Dr. Group, who harps on this 24-7 for 20 years, say?
[01:47:16.480 --> 01:47:18.480]  He says, you've got to have probiotics,
[01:47:18.480 --> 01:47:20.480]  you've got to have the proper vitamin D,
[01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:23.480]  you've got to have other things.
[01:47:23.480 --> 01:47:26.480]  And then Anthony came running in saying, Alex, look at these studies.
[01:47:26.480 --> 01:47:29.480]  This is what Group says, it's the pure iodine.
[01:47:29.480 --> 01:47:31.480]  And that's why when you first go on this two weeks in,
[01:47:31.480 --> 01:47:33.480]  you may get diarrhea and things
[01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:36.480]  because the good bacteria can live in it,
[01:47:36.480 --> 01:47:40.480]  the bad ones and the yeast and the other garbage, they can't.
[01:47:40.480 --> 01:47:45.480]  So it changes the intestinal flora and it's just as important as probiotics.
[01:47:45.480 --> 01:47:48.480]  But the probiotics are key, we don't sell those yet,
[01:47:48.480 --> 01:47:51.480]  because all of our people are so up to the newest standards,
[01:47:51.480 --> 01:47:54.480]  we've got to have the best, I just want to have the best we can get.
[01:47:54.480 --> 01:47:56.480]  Because I need to fund this operation.
[01:47:56.480 --> 01:48:00.480]  They're even more out of control than I am, I'm just being honest with you.
[01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:04.480]  So Anthony, you've got like 15 articles here, we'll document, Cam.
[01:48:04.480 --> 01:48:09.480]  Tell folks about X2. Yes, it's a plug, a plug that's key.
[01:48:09.480 --> 01:48:11.480]  Your intestine is under attack.
[01:48:11.480 --> 01:48:15.480]  The Rockefeller Foundation and the Billow Mill and the Gates Foundation
[01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:19.480]  are on record running giant research labs on how to target it.
[01:48:19.480 --> 01:48:20.480]  This is amazing.
[01:48:20.480 --> 01:48:22.480]  And the fact that they're coming out with this now
[01:48:22.480 --> 01:48:24.480]  means they're about to come out with their fancy treatments for it
[01:48:24.480 --> 01:48:27.480]  that are prescription and cost thousands of dollars.
[01:48:27.480 --> 01:48:31.480]  So again, make you sick, then come in with their solution.
[01:48:31.480 --> 01:48:33.480]  Anthony, you should already tell us about it.
[01:48:33.480 --> 01:48:37.480]  This is a really expansive topic, I mean, it's extreme.
[01:48:37.480 --> 01:48:39.480]  So the article, right, is in Bloomberg,
[01:48:39.480 --> 01:48:42.480]  how gut bacteria is shaking up cancer research, AstraZeneca.
[01:48:42.480 --> 01:48:46.480]  A lot of the immunologists are saying, five years ago, it's a quote,
[01:48:46.480 --> 01:48:49.480]  if you had asked me about bacteria and your gut playing an important role
[01:48:49.480 --> 01:48:51.480]  in your systemic immune response, I would have laughed it off.
[01:48:51.480 --> 01:48:53.480]  So he would have laughed, guess who he would have laughed at?
[01:48:53.480 --> 01:48:54.480]  He would have laughed at me.
[01:48:54.480 --> 01:48:57.480]  In 2011, and, you know, you've been talking about this.
[01:48:57.480 --> 01:48:58.480]  You wrote this article.
[01:48:58.480 --> 01:48:59.480]  No, you know more about that.
[01:48:59.480 --> 01:49:00.480]  Just treat your horn.
[01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:01.480]  2011.
[01:49:01.480 --> 01:49:02.480]  Anthony Gutiarty, let's see the article.
[01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:03.480]  Document Kim.
[01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:07.480]  It says, antibiotics could be to blame for skyrocketing mental illness rates.
[01:49:07.480 --> 01:49:11.480]  And I followed up with, antibiotics promote obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome.
[01:49:11.480 --> 01:49:15.480]  And I talk about the exact link they're talking about there in 2011.
[01:49:15.480 --> 01:49:16.480]  And then what happened?
[01:49:16.480 --> 01:49:17.480]  Now they admit it's cancer.
[01:49:17.480 --> 01:49:20.480]  Was, I was attacked, I was told I was crazy, right?
[01:49:20.480 --> 01:49:22.480]  But then, wait a minute.
[01:49:22.480 --> 01:49:26.480]  Scientific American comes out in 2015, March 1st.
[01:49:26.480 --> 01:49:27.480]  Says what?
[01:49:27.480 --> 01:49:35.480]  Mental health may depend on creatures in the gut, followed up by pretty much every major news organization on the planet.
[01:49:35.480 --> 01:49:36.480]  I want Wakefield.
[01:49:36.480 --> 01:49:37.480]  He lives 10 minutes from here.
[01:49:37.480 --> 01:49:39.480]  I want him in studio tomorrow.
[01:49:39.480 --> 01:49:43.480]  Uffington Post, surprising link between gut bacteria and anxiety.
[01:49:43.480 --> 01:49:44.480]  Tech news.
[01:49:44.480 --> 01:49:46.480]  Researchers find link between gut bacteria and mental health.
[01:49:46.480 --> 01:49:49.480]  The same thing I said in 2011.
[01:49:49.480 --> 01:49:51.480]  We've got to shoot a special report on this.
[01:49:51.480 --> 01:49:52.480]  This is so huge.
[01:49:52.480 --> 01:50:00.480]  And then you add to that, they admit that cancer is communicable from the vaccines New York Times.
[01:50:00.480 --> 01:50:06.480]  Anthony, do you think they're losing so they're having to admit the truth?
[01:50:06.480 --> 01:50:07.480]  Or what's happening?
[01:50:07.480 --> 01:50:09.480]  Because they knew this because they did this.
[01:50:09.480 --> 01:50:10.480]  They do this in the 20s in rat studies.
[01:50:10.480 --> 01:50:12.480]  Why are they suddenly telling the truth?
[01:50:12.480 --> 01:50:17.480]  The medical establishment consistently has just been putting out flagrant disinformation.
[01:50:17.480 --> 01:50:21.480]  And the researchers that aren't, not everyone's bought off, right?
[01:50:21.480 --> 01:50:24.480]  So the researchers actually look into this, like this guy, say, oh my God, what's happening?
[01:50:24.480 --> 01:50:27.480]  We've known this for 2,000 years that gut is the center of your health.
[01:50:27.480 --> 01:50:33.480]  That's why if you go to Eastern Europe or Asia everywhere, they call it medicine to eat like rotting fish, rotting vegetables.
[01:50:33.480 --> 01:50:34.480]  You want the bacteria.
[01:50:34.480 --> 01:50:36.480]  I mean, look at this article.
[01:50:36.480 --> 01:50:40.480]  Your bacteria is destroyed by just 10 days of eating processed food like McDonald's.
[01:50:40.480 --> 01:50:41.480]  It's just destroyed.
[01:50:41.480 --> 01:50:45.480]  And I've taken 20 rounds of antibiotics in my lifetime for your infections when I was younger and stuff.
[01:50:45.480 --> 01:50:47.480]  Man, I had to research this my whole life.
[01:50:47.480 --> 01:50:49.480]  It's totally all the news is out there.
[01:50:49.480 --> 01:50:52.480]  And again, you discovered all this because you got Lyme's disease and had to cure yourself.
[01:50:52.480 --> 01:50:53.480]  They couldn't help you.
[01:50:53.480 --> 01:50:54.480]  It's true.
[01:50:54.480 --> 01:50:55.480]  It's incredible.
[01:50:55.480 --> 01:50:56.480]  We'll be back.
[01:50:56.480 --> 01:50:57.480]  Stay with us.
[01:50:57.480 --> 01:50:58.480]  This is Key in Toe.
[01:50:58.480 --> 01:50:59.480]  Hi there.
[01:50:59.480 --> 01:51:01.480]  Are you an unhappy timeshare owner?
[01:51:01.480 --> 01:51:04.480]  Have you ever asked yourself, how can I get rid of my timeshare?
[01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:07.480]  Does your story go something like Stacey's story goes?
[01:51:07.480 --> 01:51:08.480]  Here's Stacey now.
[01:51:08.480 --> 01:51:14.480]  My husband and I went and visited a resort and they kind of attacked us.
[01:51:14.480 --> 01:51:17.480]  And they kept sending more and more people until we finally said yes and we bought this
[01:51:17.480 --> 01:51:21.480]  timeshare and then we were stuck in this timeshare that we couldn't get rid of and we tried all
[01:51:21.480 --> 01:51:22.480]  different ways.
[01:51:22.480 --> 01:51:24.480]  They made it seem like it was this really great deal.
[01:51:24.480 --> 01:51:27.480]  And when we said no originally, then they brought the price down.
[01:51:27.480 --> 01:51:31.480]  And then when we still said no, they brought in the manager and they brought the price down
[01:51:31.480 --> 01:51:34.480]  even lower and they started breaking out in different ways to make it look like it was
[01:51:34.480 --> 01:51:35.480]  this really awesome deal.
[01:51:35.480 --> 01:51:37.480]  In reality, it wasn't an awesome deal at all.

[01:53:24.480 --> 01:53:34.480]  From the Robert Allen system, current returns not indicative of future results.
[01:53:54.480 --> 01:53:58.480]  To survive, survivalistcaps.com.
[01:53:58.480 --> 01:54:05.480]  All the leaves of ground, leaves of ground, and the stars red.
[01:54:05.480 --> 01:54:09.480]  Folks, I start ranting and raving and getting excited because
[01:54:09.480 --> 01:54:18.480]  Billamond and Gates for 20-plus years that I know of have spent billions researching gut flora and gut disorders.
[01:54:18.480 --> 01:54:23.480]  And everything from crones to you-name-it, things that didn't exist 30, 40 years ago, is just ubiquitous now.
[01:54:23.480 --> 01:54:28.480]  It's everywhere. Neurological disorders, you name it.
[01:54:28.480 --> 01:54:44.480]  And in the gut of autistic children, Dr. Wakefield and others, other studies, found antibodies for the measles vaccines and things like that that shouldn't be there.
[01:54:44.480 --> 01:54:49.480]  And the guts are seriously screwed up and you add all these pesticides, the rest of it in.
[01:54:49.480 --> 01:54:54.480]  Now, we went over the science. I'm going to do a document cam again. Go back through those articles for folks.
[01:54:54.480 --> 01:55:00.480]  But the gut is the front line of your entire body. It's where you put the foreign food in.
[01:55:00.480 --> 01:55:07.480]  It's where you get the energy. And then the blood vessels all around your intestines take those nutrients to run the body.
[01:55:07.480 --> 01:55:13.480]  You put a bunch of pesticides. You put a bunch of GMO. You put a bunch of processed dead food in there.
[01:55:13.480 --> 01:55:24.480]  You take antibiotics. All you end up with is antibiotic-resistant bacterium and not the good bacteria.
[01:55:24.480 --> 01:55:34.480]  So, doing the research, and we're saying this because, yes, it funds us, but it's also what you need, break down the iodine research and how important it is to have that in the gut.
[01:55:34.480 --> 01:55:38.480]  So, you know, when you take antibiotics, there's, by the way, an amazing thing. It's an amazing breakthrough.
[01:55:38.480 --> 01:55:42.480]  Most of us, you know, would have died at certain points in our life without antibiotics.
[01:55:42.480 --> 01:55:45.480]  There's a side effect that you need to know how to recuperate from.
[01:55:45.480 --> 01:55:51.480]  Right. It's a double-edged sword. It goes in. It kills the bad stuff. Sure, kills the bad bacteria, but it also kills the good bacteria.
[01:55:51.480 --> 01:55:54.480]  And the good bacteria is what you need to live. It's what you need to sustain life.
[01:55:54.480 --> 01:55:58.480]  And for me, you know, I had ear infections, Lyme disease, everything. My doctor didn't say, hey, take probiotics.
[01:55:58.480 --> 01:56:01.480]  I had like 20 rounds of probiotics. My gut was supremely screwed up.
[01:56:01.480 --> 01:56:05.480]  So, I did all the research, found out things for myself. So, I was writing about it five years ago.
[01:56:05.480 --> 01:56:09.480]  That's why this guy says, if you had told me this five years ago, I would have said you're crazy and laughed at you.
[01:56:09.480 --> 01:56:15.480]  He was, yeah, he would have laughed at me. But it is true. McDonald's destroys the gut bacteria of college kids in 10 days.
[01:56:15.480 --> 01:56:19.480]  This is a professor who did this research. Okay. So, there's so many different connections here.
[01:56:19.480 --> 01:56:22.480]  But one that is really, really interesting that I wanted to talk about.
[01:56:22.480 --> 01:56:26.480]  And again, it's an expansive, capacious topic. It would take a long time to even break down.
[01:56:26.480 --> 01:56:29.480]  But the thyroid-gut connection. This is, Chris Kresser wrote this.
[01:56:29.480 --> 01:56:32.480]  There's a lot of other pieces on it, too. Life extension talks about it.
[01:56:32.480 --> 01:56:36.480]  But the gut-thyroid-immune connection is really, really interesting to me.
[01:56:36.480 --> 01:56:41.480]  And it starts off with Hippocrates. All disease begins in the gut, is the quote, right?
[01:56:41.480 --> 01:56:46.480]  2,500 years later, here we are. We're trying to realize, wow, it might actually be true.
[01:56:46.480 --> 01:56:50.480]  It's 2016. And, you know, I would have told people they were crazy if they said that five years ago.
[01:56:50.480 --> 01:56:53.480]  How about 2,500 years ago? How about that?
[01:56:53.480 --> 01:56:56.480]  And the research, I don't know if we have time to fully get into it.
[01:56:56.480 --> 01:57:01.480]  Basically, there are these thyroid hormones, and they communicate properly with your gut.
[01:57:01.480 --> 01:57:05.480]  And your gut can get leaky gut syndrome. All these things can happen when it's not in the gut.
[01:57:05.480 --> 01:57:09.480]  A lot of people, because of the fluoride, have a thyroid that basically is turned off,
[01:57:09.480 --> 01:57:12.480]  and so they're dying. They're aging prematurely.
[01:57:12.480 --> 01:57:16.480]  I mean, I know people personally in my family that have gotten on the iodine for two years,
[01:57:16.480 --> 01:57:19.480]  lost weight, their skin's better. You tan better.
[01:57:19.480 --> 01:57:24.480]  I remember a group telling me three years ago, start taking this, and your skin will get clear.
[01:57:24.480 --> 01:57:27.480]  Conversely, I had all these liver spots. They almost all went away.
[01:57:27.480 --> 01:57:31.480]  Look at this. The kid that ate McDonald's for 10 days to see if his gut flora would die.
[01:57:31.480 --> 01:57:35.480]  What happened is, after his good gut flora died, he turned a shade of gray.
[01:57:35.480 --> 01:57:40.480]  According to this, it said it also turned him gray. Okay? That's what the study says.
[01:57:40.480 --> 01:57:43.480]  Well, remember, the McDonald's food doesn't rot.
[01:57:43.480 --> 01:57:44.480]  No, it rots you.
[01:57:44.480 --> 01:57:46.480]  No more unsupervised me. They put regular cheeseburger at rots.
[01:57:46.480 --> 01:57:48.480]  There's months later. Nothing's happened.
[01:57:48.480 --> 01:57:49.480]  All processed junk.
[01:57:49.480 --> 01:57:51.480]  Mold won't even grow on it, folks.
[01:57:51.480 --> 01:57:55.480]  You're eating all that. You're taking antibiotics. You're not destroying the bad bacteria.
[01:57:55.480 --> 01:57:57.480]  Things like iodine are going to really help.
[01:57:57.480 --> 01:58:02.480]  And also, yeah, probiotic rich foods. But we're just sitting here eating death, reading dead junk food.
[01:58:02.480 --> 01:58:05.480]  And then we're saying, well, gee, it's almost like there's a link to cancer.
[01:58:05.480 --> 01:58:07.480]  Of course there's a link to cancer.
[01:58:07.480 --> 01:58:08.480]  That's Bloomberg Business.
[01:58:08.480 --> 01:58:14.480]  Top scientific, you know, genetic engineer firms, drug companies going, oh my gosh, it's the gut.
[01:58:14.480 --> 01:58:18.480]  That's why cancer is exploding. Everything's going through it. Your immune system turns off.
[01:58:18.480 --> 01:58:21.480]  Your gut gives up, folks. Game over.
[01:58:21.480 --> 01:58:25.480]  You know, my cheater fever's gotten a lot better when it comes through now because I eat the juniper berries.
[01:58:25.480 --> 01:58:28.480]  When they're about to pop, I just get them and eat them.
[01:58:28.480 --> 01:58:31.480]  I put them in a blender, blend them up with a smoothie, drink them.
[01:58:31.480 --> 01:58:33.480]  And that's the answer. I'm showing my gut.
[01:58:33.480 --> 01:58:35.480]  You eat this. You learn to deal with it.
[01:58:35.480 --> 01:58:37.480]  Dominate it. Yeah!

[02:00:20.480 --> 02:00:22.480]  All right, Roger Jones coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[02:00:22.480 --> 02:00:24.480]  I was going to open the phones up in the next segment,
[02:00:24.480 --> 02:00:28.480]  and I was about to get into North Korea claims that could wipe out Manhattan with an hydrogen bomb.
[02:00:28.480 --> 02:00:30.480]  Russia is threatening to invade.
[02:00:30.480 --> 02:00:33.480]  Russia is pivoting to the east in Asia where war is looming,
[02:00:33.480 --> 02:00:37.480]  and I was already thinking to myself, well, they don't want a two-front war.
[02:00:37.480 --> 02:00:39.480]  They're in Syria.
[02:00:39.480 --> 02:00:47.480]  Mexico, Acosta walked in and gave me this article about two minutes ago.
[02:00:47.480 --> 02:00:50.480]  The Washington Post, and I don't believe U.S. media sometimes,
[02:00:50.480 --> 02:00:53.480]  because I saw CNN say that Russia attacked Georgia in 2008,
[02:00:53.480 --> 02:00:57.480]  but I'm sure this is true. This is too bold, but we're checking in Associated Press.
[02:00:57.480 --> 02:01:01.480]  The latest Putin orders military pullout from Syria.
[02:01:01.480 --> 02:01:03.480]  They're pulling their entire military force out.
[02:01:03.480 --> 02:01:05.480]  They're fighter bombers, all of it.
[02:01:05.480 --> 02:01:10.480]  Since the 27th of February, truce, they say has been basically followed,
[02:01:10.480 --> 02:01:14.480]  but they say the al-Qaida people are still being bombed by coalition forces.
[02:01:14.480 --> 02:01:19.480]  I don't know what this signifies at this point, but Russia, it is in Russian news.
[02:01:19.480 --> 02:01:25.480]  Putin orders start of Russian military withdrawal from Syria, says objectives achieved,
[02:01:25.480 --> 02:01:29.480]  and the U.S. military is now launching attacks on al-Qaida
[02:01:29.480 --> 02:01:32.480]  and is basically ignoring the orders of Obama not to.
[02:01:32.480 --> 02:01:37.480]  So Russia has really played this skillfully,
[02:01:37.480 --> 02:01:42.480]  and has come in and given a real coalition time to form,
[02:01:42.480 --> 02:01:46.480]  has embarrassed the West into not backing al-Qaida.
[02:01:46.480 --> 02:01:49.480]  Saudi Arabia threatened to invade a month ago,
[02:01:49.480 --> 02:01:55.480]  and so they made the deal, and it appears that it's some type of armistice or ceasefire.
[02:01:55.480 --> 02:01:59.480]  Now, we'll see if the West follows that deal,
[02:01:59.480 --> 02:02:02.480]  but this is very ominous.
[02:02:02.480 --> 02:02:05.480]  I told you I got up this morning with the most anxiety I've ever had.
[02:02:05.480 --> 02:02:08.480]  Okay, I'm not somebody that has anxiety, I'm very confident.
[02:02:08.480 --> 02:02:12.480]  When I have it, when I start, it's more like, it's like right in the center of my mind,
[02:02:12.480 --> 02:02:16.480]  it starts going search, search, search, something big's about to happen.
[02:02:16.480 --> 02:02:22.480]  This could be it. This could signify all Hades is about to break loose on the Korean peninsula.
[02:02:22.480 --> 02:02:26.480]  I'm going to think about this more and come back from the break and talk about it.
[02:02:26.480 --> 02:02:29.480]  Oh, I tell you, they got sleeper cells all over the place too.
[02:02:29.480 --> 02:02:31.480]  They brought in the radical jihadis.
[02:02:31.480 --> 02:02:33.480]  I've got other intel.
[02:02:33.480 --> 02:02:38.480]  Also, in the Section 8 housing across the country, they're throwing U.S. citizens out and putting jihadis in.
[02:02:38.480 --> 02:02:40.480]  I have it all confirmed.
[02:02:40.480 --> 02:02:44.480]  I tell you, Anthony and Shari, I wanted to hold you over to get more into this huge news
[02:02:44.480 --> 02:02:48.480]  that top research facilities in the U.S., top drug companies go,
[02:02:48.480 --> 02:02:52.480]  okay, the gut has collapsed because of GMO and the pesticides,
[02:02:52.480 --> 02:02:55.480]  and autism and cancer and everything, it's true.
[02:02:55.480 --> 02:02:58.480]  That's in Bloomberg business.
[02:02:58.480 --> 02:03:00.480]  That's so massive.
[02:03:00.480 --> 02:03:02.480]  They're coming out admitting cancer is mainly communicable.
[02:03:02.480 --> 02:03:05.480]  That's massive New York Times.
[02:03:05.480 --> 02:03:08.480]  And then meanwhile, they're setting up war in North Korea.
[02:03:08.480 --> 02:03:10.480]  North Korea is asking to get nuked.
[02:03:10.480 --> 02:03:12.480]  I've never seen such rhetoric.
[02:03:12.480 --> 02:03:14.480]  What do you think's going on?
[02:03:14.480 --> 02:03:17.480]  Isn't it funny that Russia's making strategic military decisions
[02:03:17.480 --> 02:03:20.480]  and really precisely stating their objectives have been achieved
[02:03:20.480 --> 02:03:25.480]  and meanwhile, in the United States, we're fighting over whether hate speech is happening in certain cities
[02:03:25.480 --> 02:03:29.480]  and rallies are being shut down and the news is freaking out because people were offended.
[02:03:29.480 --> 02:03:32.480]  Russia's, you know, it could be, I'm not in Russia, I don't have that.
[02:03:32.480 --> 02:03:34.480]  Not showing how good Russia is, showing how bad we are.
[02:03:34.480 --> 02:03:36.480]  We're just so tied up.
[02:03:36.480 --> 02:03:38.480]  No one even knows anything about Syria at this point.
[02:03:38.480 --> 02:03:40.480]  No one in the news is even aware of this.
[02:03:40.480 --> 02:03:43.480]  If you were to tell this to most people on the street that they pulled out of Syria,
[02:03:43.480 --> 02:03:44.480]  they'd be like, what, they're in Syria?
[02:03:44.480 --> 02:03:45.480]  They don't even know Syria.
[02:03:45.480 --> 02:03:46.480]  Hillary knows that.
[02:03:46.480 --> 02:03:49.480]  That's why she said them, they said, well, the Turkish ambassador was there.
[02:03:49.480 --> 02:03:54.480]  You know, from Turkey in Benghazi, she goes, Turkey, what about turkeys?
[02:03:54.480 --> 02:03:58.480]  Knowing her people that think they're pseudo-intellectuals, you know,
[02:03:58.480 --> 02:04:02.480]  because they've got, you know, cool pig tails or whatever in green socks.
[02:04:02.480 --> 02:04:07.480]  They're like, yeah, it's just a society of morals led by criminals.
[02:04:07.480 --> 02:04:09.480]  That's been on my mind for a while.
[02:04:09.480 --> 02:04:10.480]  This is really, really important.
[02:04:10.480 --> 02:04:14.480]  People think that they're intelligent when they act pseudo-intellectual
[02:04:14.480 --> 02:04:17.480]  and try to use fake academia over you, just like that.
[02:04:17.480 --> 02:04:19.480]  Oh, Turkey, what are you talking about?
[02:04:19.480 --> 02:04:20.480]  They don't even know anything that's happening on this planet.
[02:04:20.480 --> 02:04:24.480]  Well, she knows where Turkey is, but exactly where she just knew her supporters
[02:04:24.480 --> 02:04:26.480]  are the dumbest people on the planet.
[02:04:26.480 --> 02:04:29.480]  Well, like, it's these people that buy into the weird academia,
[02:04:29.480 --> 02:04:32.480]  that buy into the establishment, and they're going to go ahead and start using weirdness
[02:04:32.480 --> 02:04:34.480]  to, you know, some pseudo-intellectualism to attack you.
[02:04:34.480 --> 02:04:36.480]  They don't even know what's happening in Syria.
[02:04:36.480 --> 02:04:39.480]  So what I'm saying is, these people are too worried about their safe spaces
[02:04:39.480 --> 02:04:42.480]  and interviewing the guy that tried to get on Trump's stage
[02:04:42.480 --> 02:04:44.480]  and say how horrible he was victimized.
[02:04:44.480 --> 02:04:47.480]  You know what safe spaces are? They're fantasy lands.
[02:04:47.480 --> 02:04:49.480]  Well, people live in La La Land. It's not that much different, right?
[02:04:49.480 --> 02:04:52.480]  I know. These people live at Fantasy Island.
[02:04:52.480 --> 02:04:53.480]  They do.
[02:04:53.480 --> 02:04:55.480]  They're a bunch of bloated, stupid...
[02:04:55.480 --> 02:04:57.480]  I mean, go down to UT, folks.
[02:04:58.480 --> 02:05:03.480]  Action hero Jean-Claude Van Damme told a French television political show
[02:05:03.480 --> 02:05:09.480]  that the Rothschild and Rockefeller families will not let Donald Trump win the presidency
[02:05:09.480 --> 02:05:14.480]  because he is an anti-globalist candidate. Appearing on the La Grande Journal,
[02:05:14.480 --> 02:05:20.480]  Van Damme said he was aware of who is really shaping U.S. presidential elections.
[02:05:20.480 --> 02:05:24.480]  Some of the other participants in the debate looked stunned,
[02:05:24.480 --> 02:05:30.480]  as Van Damme continued to say that the Rothschilds rose to power in 1827,
[02:05:30.480 --> 02:05:33.480]  and they now control and dominate entire continents.
[02:05:33.480 --> 02:05:37.480]  And he says Donald Trump is not going to win the election.
[02:05:37.480 --> 02:05:42.480]  He went on to make a distinction between lobbyists that control the other candidates
[02:05:42.480 --> 02:05:47.480]  and people like Donald Trump, who is truly anti-establishment.

[02:09:00.920 --> 02:09:04.760]  think you might want to look at this world government system and guess its
[02:09:04.760 --> 02:09:31.320]  name all right let's let's start getting into the really serious news this
[02:09:31.320 --> 02:09:39.240]  is super hardcore folks it's confirmed by the Russian Foreign Ministry and it
[02:09:39.240 --> 02:09:44.520]  ties together with the North Korea situation the latest Putin orders
[02:09:44.520 --> 02:09:51.760]  military pullout from Syria this just broke in the last hour like literally
[02:09:51.760 --> 02:09:57.240]  the last 20 minutes the latest on Syria peace talks Russian president
[02:09:57.240 --> 02:10:01.000]  Vladimir Putin has ordered start of the pullout of the Russian military from
[02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:08.520]  Syria starting tomorrow Putin said the move should help serve a stimulus for
[02:10:08.520 --> 02:10:12.880]  serious political talks the president said he coordinated the move with Syrian
[02:10:12.880 --> 02:10:18.440]  president Bashar Assad who said the Russian air base in Syria's coastal
[02:10:18.440 --> 02:10:23.640]  province enable facility in the Syrian port of Tartarus will continue to
[02:10:23.640 --> 02:10:28.320]  operate but that's always basically been there Russia says that his voice
[02:10:28.320 --> 02:10:35.200]  concerns about the ceasefire violations by U.S. backed rebels in Syria the
[02:10:35.200 --> 02:10:39.600]  Defense Ministry said Monday that the Russian military coordinated center in
[02:10:39.600 --> 02:10:44.320]  Syria had a conference call with its U.S. counterpart in Amman province about
[02:10:44.320 --> 02:10:50.120]  violations of Russian and U.S. broker truce by opposition units near the
[02:10:50.120 --> 02:10:57.920]  Amman province it says militants in the area have been listed by the U.S. as
[02:10:57.920 --> 02:11:02.000]  abiding by the ceasefire when they're not by the way they're a bunch of chemical
[02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:07.480]  attacks over the weekend in Iraq by ISIS remember when Al Qaeda slash ISIS
[02:11:07.480 --> 02:11:12.080]  launched chemical attacks in Syria and tried to blame the Syrian army for it
[02:11:12.080 --> 02:11:16.640]  but the jihadists are manipulated but not fully controlled there they were with
[02:11:16.640 --> 02:11:23.000]  the Saudi Arabian mortars firing the nerve gas that was nerve gas this is
[02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:31.240]  mustard gas and screaming Allah Akbar and waving their Al Qaeda flex so this is
[02:11:31.240 --> 02:11:35.560]  how dumb they think we are and they had Megan Kelly and all usual suspects go on
[02:11:35.560 --> 02:11:42.040]  the news and CIA operative Anderson Cooper and say that Assad had done it and
[02:11:42.040 --> 02:11:45.880]  that they'd passed the red line didn't matter within a week even the UN had to
[02:11:45.880 --> 02:11:50.400]  admit okay it was Saudi Arabia and now Saudi Arabia is threatening the whole
[02:11:50.400 --> 02:11:56.720]  hog in vade and Russia is pulling out now Russia came to the table did a peace
[02:11:56.720 --> 02:12:01.240]  deal they've knocked out ISIS in many areas the U.S. has been shamed and
[02:12:01.240 --> 02:12:05.040]  actually fighting some of the ISIS forces so I think it's too soon to tell
[02:12:05.040 --> 02:12:09.640]  exactly what's going on here I'll tell you this though the financial worldwide
[02:12:09.640 --> 02:12:16.600]  collapse the pivot towards Asia what North Korea is currently up to my
[02:12:16.600 --> 02:12:22.400]  spider sense as I've been saying all day is the hottest it's ever been I am
[02:12:22.400 --> 02:12:28.000]  beyond chills going up and down my back right now but my mind is just searching
[02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:31.760]  looking what is it why are you so concerned because every time I've
[02:12:31.760 --> 02:12:35.400]  talked about this only seven or eight times on air this happening every time
[02:12:35.400 --> 02:12:39.800]  I'm ha I'm really freaked out big stuff happens
[02:12:45.320 --> 02:12:50.800]  it is so wild now let's look at this article that ties into it also out of
[02:12:50.800 --> 02:12:54.440]  the Washington Post North Korea claims it could wipe out Manhattan with a
[02:12:54.440 --> 02:13:01.480]  hydrogen bomb just last week they threatened to nuke she'll South Korea
[02:13:01.480 --> 02:13:04.320]  of over 10 million people just preemptively said we'll blow you up
[02:13:04.320 --> 02:13:13.320]  look Russia then threatened with its foreign ministry to quote invade and all
[02:13:13.320 --> 02:13:16.440]  you that worship the state and worship the power you get from it you ought to
[02:13:16.440 --> 02:13:26.640]  worship Kim Jong-un as your fat rat dictator hereditary just monster he's
[02:13:26.640 --> 02:13:31.200]  spoiled he's stupid he's physically weak he's evil he thinks Dennis Rodman is
[02:13:31.200 --> 02:13:37.880]  cool yes horrible taste he's turned Korea that he controls North Korea into a
[02:13:37.880 --> 02:13:43.720]  living hellhole where humans are raised like animals and children are taken at
[02:13:43.720 --> 02:13:50.400]  birth and sent to other facilities so no one has a human connection they tell
[02:13:50.400 --> 02:13:54.760]  the people in North Korea that birds sing and their sunny weather because of
[02:13:54.760 --> 02:13:59.640]  him should we play the footage of people crying when his father died for three
[02:13:59.640 --> 02:14:03.640]  days those that didn't cry long enough were sent to force labor camps because
[02:14:03.640 --> 02:14:07.320]  that's what produces there you've got the little miners that boss everyone
[02:14:07.320 --> 02:14:10.760]  around and tell you what speech to use and how to behave the political correct
[02:14:10.760 --> 02:14:17.480]  folks the top 10% who all feed on each other to and then 90% living as
[02:14:17.480 --> 02:14:22.480]  chattel animals who don't even know where they are in the world don't know
[02:14:22.480 --> 02:14:33.360]  how to write and literally worship him as a god king a god king and now he's
[02:14:33.360 --> 02:14:37.160]  executing his family executing his top generals China has never done this they
[02:14:37.160 --> 02:14:41.400]  have threatened them two weeks ago they that they better stop it or they'll
[02:14:41.400 --> 02:14:44.640]  militarily respond the Russians have threatened to invade they're on their
[02:14:44.640 --> 02:14:52.720]  border they're threatening to printively blow up South Korea and our filthy
[02:14:52.720 --> 02:14:59.760]  degenerate evil government under Bill Clinton gave them not one but two nuclear
[02:14:59.760 --> 02:15:04.160]  reactors that you can make fizzle material for atomic and hydrogen bombs
[02:15:04.160 --> 02:15:09.480]  with I was on the air in 96 97 98 when conservatives and patriots fought the
[02:15:09.480 --> 02:15:15.120]  deal and they transferred the reactors and CNN had headlines like I'll never
[02:15:15.120 --> 02:15:20.240]  forget it our members of Congress trying to block nuclear deal because they're
[02:15:20.240 --> 02:15:24.480]  anti-Asian and racist I remember headlines on CNN and articles where they
[02:15:24.480 --> 02:15:28.440]  would say solve the Chinese generals would meet with Clinton in the White
[02:15:28.440 --> 02:15:31.880]  House and you know and give donations and we and others would cover it and they
[02:15:31.880 --> 02:15:37.240]  would have headlines like is all this anti-China forever for racism no we
[02:15:37.240 --> 02:15:42.240]  just didn't want you to give our Merv technology and our ICBM technology to
[02:15:42.240 --> 02:15:44.960]  them so they could blow up the United States we didn't want you to give them
[02:15:44.960 --> 02:15:51.640]  cruise missile technology or Minuteman technology or Polaris technology or
[02:15:51.640 --> 02:15:58.240]  Triton technology they gave them everything this is the government that
[02:15:58.240 --> 02:16:01.160]  wants to stick its hands down your pants and put you in a good body scanner at
[02:16:01.160 --> 02:16:05.680]  the airport but the borders wide open and they're giving radical Muslims
[02:16:05.680 --> 02:16:08.680]  brought in by the tens of thousands of weeks the real number we we have the
[02:16:08.680 --> 02:16:12.280]  big story I it's gonna make take major work to put it all out but we already
[02:16:12.280 --> 02:16:15.760]  confirmed it but just when you have the documents the eyewitnesses the reports
[02:16:15.760 --> 02:16:20.360]  all of it I have to then go discover it all for my own not to hurt the whistle
[02:16:20.360 --> 02:16:26.080]  blowers I have it just over the top sensational you think it's in Dallas and
[02:16:26.080 --> 02:16:32.280]  in Austin and in LA and in New York City at LaGuardia and JFK where they're
[02:16:32.280 --> 02:16:35.920]  flying in whole planes of a hundred and forty a hundred and fifty two you know
[02:16:35.920 --> 02:16:41.080]  and it's in the news oh they flew in a bunch of illegals again no one checked
[02:16:41.080 --> 02:16:49.080]  their IDs they just walked through customs that's because they are then
[02:16:49.080 --> 02:17:03.040]  bussed to a federal facility and they are given social security cards and new names folks but
[02:17:03.040 --> 02:17:08.360]  then oh you better have your ID on you it's all a joke we're wide open who was it
[02:17:08.360 --> 02:17:11.960]  was it Joe big drove through the 80 mile you know into Texas checkpoint a few
[02:17:11.960 --> 02:17:17.080]  years ago and they want to search the truck and he goes why should we there's
[02:17:17.080 --> 02:17:21.480]  no border anyways they go you're right go on through the border patrol doesn't
[02:17:21.480 --> 02:17:28.800]  like it and then when Trump says we should do something it's racist how's
[02:17:28.800 --> 02:17:32.640]  everybody gonna feel of nuclear war breaks out of the Korean Peninsula as
[02:17:32.640 --> 02:17:36.280]  Joel Scousen has said to other top experts if there's a nuclear exchange
[02:17:36.280 --> 02:17:41.640]  it'll be about 24 hours before the big nuclear war with the Chinese Communist
[02:17:41.640 --> 02:17:47.600]  and the quote USA starts and our own government gave them the missiles and
[02:17:47.600 --> 02:17:53.360]  gave them the material our government gave the Chinese the nukes in the late
[02:17:53.360 --> 02:17:58.760]  50s early 60s our government not the Rosenbergs they were the Patsy's they
[02:17:58.760 --> 02:18:01.880]  gave them the nukes
[02:18:04.040 --> 02:18:08.560]  because it's a big plan to bring down the whole world it's an evil plan to
[02:18:08.560 --> 02:18:12.400]  depopulate and all of you that think you're part of the system you want to
[02:18:12.400 --> 02:18:15.760]  just keep denying what we're saying because it's scary you're gonna find out
[02:18:15.760 --> 02:18:21.240]  I don't know if it's this month or next year or five years from now but all the
[02:18:21.240 --> 02:18:25.040]  geopolitical strategist are on record saying a giant world war is on the
[02:18:25.040 --> 02:18:30.800]  front burner now and you add economic collapse to that look at Greece in
[02:18:30.800 --> 02:18:38.280]  Greece 40% of loans and 55% of mortgages are not being paid down people are
[02:18:38.280 --> 02:18:42.040]  leaving their kids at homeless shelters by the thousands suicide is off the
[02:18:42.040 --> 02:18:46.400]  chart this is out of the economist the markets remain nervous bank shares are
[02:18:46.400 --> 02:18:51.360]  down 36 since the start of the year massive austerity massive new taxes
[02:18:51.360 --> 02:18:57.360]  meant to further smother the economy and then buy it all up then they tell
[02:18:57.360 --> 02:19:01.320]  Greece we want you to take hundreds of thousands of North Africa and Muslim
[02:19:01.320 --> 02:19:07.560]  invaders every month one island Greece has hundreds of islands of lesbos has
[02:19:07.560 --> 02:19:12.480]  had hundreds of thousands arrived at it in the last year the island didn't have
[02:19:12.480 --> 02:19:20.240]  5,000 people living on it and then when the invasion happens the liberal
[02:19:20.240 --> 02:19:24.480]  media just goes be liberal be laughing Merkel's like we'll work on the problem
[02:19:24.480 --> 02:19:27.880]  just bringing them in bringing them in bringing them in to collapse everything
[02:19:27.880 --> 02:19:34.920]  this is scientific takedown and they want you to live like they do in Greece
[02:19:34.920 --> 02:19:41.360]  and once you're poor you're gonna be working 18 hours a day 16 hours a day

[02:19:44.400 --> 02:19:49.920]  and so the stairs to liberty the stairs to wealth are being removed it's like

[02:24:41.120 --> 02:24:50.120]  there Boris Johnson the liberal trendy loved mayor of London was quoted there's
[02:24:50.120 --> 02:24:54.400]  a video of it it's up on info wars.com London telegraph says Americans would
[02:24:54.400 --> 02:25:02.720]  never accept EU restrictions so why should we it's now 90 plus percent of
[02:25:02.720 --> 02:25:08.200]  their laws not 80% are made by an unelected EU bureaucracy that's levying
[02:25:08.200 --> 02:25:12.720]  taxes on them but it gets better the EU bureaucrats exempt themselves from the
[02:25:12.720 --> 02:25:20.520]  tax. Barack Obama's plan to urge voters to remain in the European Union is a
[02:25:20.520 --> 02:25:27.720]  piece of outrage and exuberant hypocrisy Boris Johnson writes this is his
[02:25:27.720 --> 02:25:31.520]  article I love America I believe in the American dream indeed I hold that the
[02:25:31.520 --> 02:25:34.800]  story of the past 100 years has been very largely about how America rose the
[02:25:34.800 --> 02:25:38.840]  global greatness how America has helped to preserve and expand democracy around
[02:25:38.840 --> 02:25:42.800]  the world in two global conflicts and throughout the Cold War the United
[02:25:42.800 --> 02:25:47.760]  States has fought for the founding ideals of the Republic that government of
[02:25:47.760 --> 02:25:52.040]  the people by the people for the people should not perish from the earth I love
[02:25:52.040 --> 02:25:57.240]  them quoting founding fathers there he wants to get out of the euro because he
[02:25:57.240 --> 02:26:01.800]  knows like 80 some percent of the people to the US government officials should
[02:26:01.800 --> 02:26:05.440]  believe that Britain must remain within the EU a system which democracy is
[02:26:05.440 --> 02:26:09.000]  increasingly undermined the other ban and free speech they're arresting people
[02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:13.160]  this guy's more of a real liberal he's not perfect compared to like a Merkel and
[02:26:13.160 --> 02:26:17.400]  then he goes in you got to read the article
[02:26:18.720 --> 02:26:22.640]  sometime the next couple of months we were told that President Obama himself is
[02:26:22.640 --> 02:26:31.520]  going to arrive in this country like some do sex to pronounce on the matter
[02:26:31.520 --> 02:26:36.040]  Air Force one will touchdown a lectern will the presidential seal will be
[02:26:36.040 --> 02:26:40.080]  erected the British people will be told to be good to themselves do the right
[02:26:40.080 --> 02:26:45.080]  thing we'll be informed by our most important ally that is our interest to
[02:26:45.080 --> 02:26:50.240]  stay in the EU no matter how flawed we may feel the organization to be never
[02:26:50.240 --> 02:26:54.240]  mind the loss of sovereignty never mind the expense and the bureaucracy and the
[02:26:54.240 --> 02:27:00.320]  uncontrolled immigration this is a liberal talking like Nigel Farage now
[02:27:00.320 --> 02:27:04.240]  do you see what's happening
[02:27:10.320 --> 02:27:16.160]  what I did is I've got another article with the mayor saying some more things I
[02:27:16.160 --> 02:27:18.920]  think I'm mixing with two articles here together the point is you've got this
[02:27:18.920 --> 02:27:22.680]  article then we've got Jean-Claude von Damme I mentioned this earlier so I won't
[02:27:22.680 --> 02:27:31.640]  belabor it Rockefeller and Rothschild families won't let Trump win and then he
[02:27:31.640 --> 02:27:34.880]  goes in to talk about how we're run by a global elite how globalism is a bit
[02:27:34.880 --> 02:27:38.680]  destroy the nation-state make us dependent I mean whether it's the
[02:27:38.680 --> 02:27:49.280]  London mayor or whether it's Jean-Claude von Damme people are getting it people
[02:27:49.280 --> 02:27:54.160]  are understanding it people are figuring it out people are understanding
[02:27:54.160 --> 02:27:58.600]  wait foreign mega banks want a hundred trillion in carbon taxes every ten years
[02:27:58.600 --> 02:28:04.360]  to quote fund a new global government and they give themselves the money think
[02:28:04.360 --> 02:28:13.080]  about that they give themselves the money they're all exempt and then they
[02:28:13.080 --> 02:28:21.040]  want us all to just accept this and shut up and go along with it and now you get
[02:28:21.040 --> 02:28:23.400]  you're getting liberals and you're getting conservatives you're getting
[02:28:23.400 --> 02:28:26.960]  people across the board just saying no we're not going to be part of this
[02:28:26.960 --> 02:28:31.640]  anymore we're not going to go along with this anymore we understand what's
[02:28:31.640 --> 02:28:36.320]  happening and the moment you understand that we are run by multinational banks
[02:28:36.320 --> 02:28:39.760]  that own big pharma the military industrial complex they own it all and
[02:28:39.760 --> 02:28:43.880]  that it's Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan and other big banks that are multinational
[02:28:43.880 --> 02:28:48.800]  that were set up with foreign money American and name only that give money
[02:28:48.800 --> 02:28:52.840]  to open the borders that give money for forced inoculation propaganda that pay
[02:28:52.840 --> 02:28:57.280]  money to try to raise taxes with lobbyist on the people who are who are
[02:28:57.280 --> 02:29:01.800]  funding anti-gun initiatives anti-family initiatives federalization
[02:29:01.800 --> 02:29:08.760]  initiatives launching new wars spying on us those bureaucrats are the minions
[02:29:08.760 --> 02:29:13.680]  of the corporate chiefs who are the captains and the generals and the field
[02:29:13.680 --> 02:29:22.080]  marshals of less than 15 global mega families who own the whole world and you
[02:29:22.080 --> 02:29:27.000]  can read books by Kissinger's Kissinger Group head Rothkopf Carol Quigley all of
[02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:32.320]  them admitting this Zbigniew Brzezinski wrote books on the 70s admitting it and
[02:29:32.320 --> 02:29:34.640]  people ask why do you write books admitting it was all the publics to
[02:29:34.640 --> 02:29:38.000]  dumb never read them I need to be able to give this to my operative so they
[02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:41.640]  understand like sir we fund fascist and communist but never freedom that's right

[02:29:46.440 --> 02:29:52.760]  what they want we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the
[02:29:52.760 --> 02:30:02.440]  GCN radio network last week we reported on one Pablo Serrano Viterino an illegal

[02:30:05.560 --> 02:30:09.200]  AK-47 now it has emerged that US immigration authorities had this man
[02:30:09.200 --> 02:30:13.520]  in custody twice last year and let him slip through their fingers it also just
[02:30:13.520 --> 02:30:17.280]  came out that ice revealed that 124 illegal immigrants released from jail
[02:30:17.280 --> 02:30:21.560]  by the Obama administration since 2010 have subsequently been charged with
[02:30:21.560 --> 02:30:24.760]  murder the report from the Center of Immigration Studies reads the criminal
[02:30:24.760 --> 02:30:27.800]  aliens released by ice in these years who had already been convicted of
[02:30:27.800 --> 02:30:31.360]  thousands of crimes are responsible for a significant crime spree in American
[02:30:31.360 --> 02:30:36.280]  communities including 124 homicides inexplicably ice is choosing to release
[02:30:36.280 --> 02:30:40.960]  some criminal aliens multiple times John Kasich in Thursday's CNN debate who
[02:30:40.960 --> 02:30:44.680]  said he would enact his largest amnesty in US history within his first hundred
[02:30:44.680 --> 02:30:48.080]  days in office here's a man barely hanging on to his political life who
[02:30:48.080 --> 02:30:51.360]  wants to offer amnesty for people who came here illegally and some of which
[02:30:51.360 --> 02:30:54.560]  have proven to be homicidal maniacs thank God we still have the second

[02:33:30.600 --> 02:33:37.360]  liberal mayor super popular of London of course has come for leaving the EU he
[02:33:37.360 --> 02:33:41.160]  calls it tyrannical he says it's taking their rights it's federalizing
[02:33:41.160 --> 02:33:46.480]  everything and the bureaucrats are tax exempt he calls it a tyranny I mean this

[02:33:54.640 --> 02:34:00.240]  they hate sovereignty he explains it's the new colonialism of the big megabanks
[02:34:00.240 --> 02:34:05.520]  above us the world's getting it the hundredth monkey syndrome it's been
[02:34:05.520 --> 02:34:11.120]  proven in major studies that it was a what a primate research institute more
[02:34:11.120 --> 02:34:14.640]  than 60 years ago you can look it up but a few miles away on another island
[02:34:14.640 --> 02:34:18.680]  another research institute with the monkeys as well and as soon as they
[02:34:18.680 --> 02:34:23.280]  would teach monkeys a task they never done before suddenly as if like through
[02:34:23.280 --> 02:34:28.200]  osmosis the monkeys miles away or 50 miles away would suddenly learn how to
[02:34:28.200 --> 02:34:32.240]  do it as well I mean who knows what's really going on there's a lot of you
[02:34:32.240 --> 02:34:37.040]  know weird stuff out there and the point is is that people are just getting it

[02:34:59.080 --> 02:35:04.680]  basically everybody wakes up hmm start a war with North Korea I wonder if the
[02:35:04.680 --> 02:35:07.520]  North Korean dictator who was raised in Switzerland's made a deal with somebody
[02:35:07.520 --> 02:35:12.240]  the criminal organization an intelligence agency I don't know but he's
[02:35:12.240 --> 02:35:15.880]  saying I'm gonna nuke South Korea next week I'm gonna blow up New York begging
[02:35:15.880 --> 02:35:22.400]  to be hit is he simply insane this is sober the top I'm gonna he worked in a

[02:37:10.920 --> 02:37:14.200]  friend former head of his campaign out on his own so he can really take the
[02:37:14.200 --> 02:37:18.720]  gloves off in the last eight months you see him all over television all over
[02:37:18.720 --> 02:37:23.000]  the history channel all over CNN all over Fox but he was banned from CNN two
[02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:26.440]  weeks ago and now Ron Paul's come out and said Loretta Lynch and the
[02:37:26.440 --> 02:37:30.120]  government were on free speech we're talking about arresting people that
[02:37:30.120 --> 02:37:35.880]  deny man-made global climate change and they're talking about in the Washington
[02:37:35.880 --> 02:37:41.680]  Post arresting Donald Trump or suing him saying that his rhetoric is causing move
[02:37:41.680 --> 02:37:45.840]  on.org and Hillary to come in and attack Donald Trump supporters and Trump
[02:37:45.840 --> 02:37:51.720]  himself talk about upside down bizarro world Saturday called us we broke the
[02:37:51.720 --> 02:37:56.760]  news it went viral the signs are printed up they say they're Bernie
[02:37:56.760 --> 02:38:00.100]  supporters but you know who runs Chicago the Clinton crime machine with
[02:38:00.100 --> 02:38:04.320]  Rahm Emanuel and then they came out their stone was on our show and move on
[02:38:04.320 --> 02:38:10.080]  dot org said we take responsibility Soros does well they support Hillary but
[02:38:10.080 --> 02:38:14.280]  Trump still is just saying hey Bernie watch it and I guess he thinks the
[02:38:14.280 --> 02:38:16.800]  public's dumbed down and thinks it was Bernie or maybe he didn't listen to the
[02:38:16.800 --> 02:38:19.800]  stone we'll find out right now but for me this is a big deal we'll spend a few
[02:38:19.800 --> 02:38:24.200]  minutes on that recapping and getting new intel and then the big news several
[02:38:24.200 --> 02:38:29.280]  of his articles I have here from the Daily Caller and others sex candles looming
[02:38:29.280 --> 02:38:35.760]  for Cruz who's the real Heidi Cruz and more so Roger Stone joins us Roger Stone
[02:38:35.760 --> 02:38:40.320]  thank you so much for coming back on Alex great to be with you and your skype's
[02:38:40.320 --> 02:38:43.400]  blipping out a little bit but now you're back with us wow you've got the floor
[02:38:43.400 --> 02:38:48.600]  where should we start any place any place you like I think it's amazing and I
[02:38:48.600 --> 02:38:55.960]  have to lead off with this we now have a video of the man who attacked Donald
[02:38:55.960 --> 02:39:01.160]  Trump the other day in a rally and the opening of this video he is brandishing
[02:39:01.160 --> 02:39:06.200]  and oozy and declaring his terrorist connections the mainstream media is
[02:39:06.200 --> 02:39:10.680]  already editing that part out they're going to show us this this brave
[02:39:10.680 --> 02:39:15.520]  demonstrator who's speaking out against Trump why this guy has even been
[02:39:15.520 --> 02:39:21.360]  released after after lunging by security and the Secret Service why he has not
[02:39:21.360 --> 02:39:27.400]  been arrested and hasn't been charged is amazing to me as I said on this very
[02:39:35.400 --> 02:39:39.640]  Roger your skype's breaking up real bad we may have to keep the video but go to
[02:39:39.640 --> 02:39:44.320]  cell phone or landline in a moment but getting back to that this is a guy trying
[02:39:44.320 --> 02:39:48.120]  to run up on stage saying you wanted to kill Trump on his social media accounts
[02:39:48.120 --> 02:39:51.080]  now you're saying I haven't seen this yet please direct us to it sure it's on
[02:39:51.080 --> 02:39:56.320]  drudge if I've missed it brandishing a gun and he's not in trouble he instead
[02:39:56.320 --> 02:40:02.960]  he's on CNN as a hero yes it's absolutely amazing and it's
[02:40:02.960 --> 02:40:07.320]  we say well the entire Chicago administration is funded for three
[02:40:07.320 --> 02:40:13.920]  people George Soros David Brock which is real source money and the idiot son who
[02:40:13.920 --> 02:40:19.400]  is the heir to the progressive insurance fortune Jonathan Lewis again this is
[02:40:19.400 --> 02:40:24.320]  important these are not Sanders supporters the idea here is to drive a
[02:40:24.320 --> 02:40:30.160]  wedge between Trump and those blue collar Sanders supporters who are
[02:40:30.160 --> 02:40:34.720]  motivated by their opposition to the international trade agreements like
[02:40:34.720 --> 02:40:38.760]  NAFTA that have destroyed the job market in much of the United States
[02:40:38.760 --> 02:40:43.520]  particularly the Midwest and the Northeast the Democratic chieftains the
[02:40:43.520 --> 02:40:49.600]  Clinton cabal can see these votes moving to Trump in a general election so the
[02:40:49.600 --> 02:40:55.240]  effort here is to alienate them from Trump by branding Trump as a racist at
[02:40:55.240 --> 02:41:00.240]  the same time fishing for an overreaction from Trump's supporters so
[02:41:00.240 --> 02:41:06.040]  they can then push it point at Trump and say oh you see he's inciting violence
[02:41:06.040 --> 02:41:11.960]  he's the one inciting violence you're right it's cock-ass it's backwards but
[02:41:11.960 --> 02:41:16.880]  where are Marco Rubio and particularly Ted Cruz sure I'm gonna cut you off right
[02:41:16.880 --> 02:41:20.320]  there Roger your skype's degraded too much keep the video we're gonna call
[02:41:20.320 --> 02:41:23.440]  your cell phone right now and then we'll have cell phone for audio but have you
[02:41:23.440 --> 02:41:28.560]  video that way Roger Stone stonezone.com is our guest we're seeing the veil be
[02:41:28.560 --> 02:41:34.120]  pulled back unprecedented Democrats Republicans the Chinese communists just
[02:41:34.120 --> 02:41:38.160]  everybody coming out saying you can't have Donald Trump and then all these
[02:41:38.160 --> 02:41:41.640]  people from the left you name it foreigners saying we should support
[02:41:41.640 --> 02:41:46.040]  Trump he just wants sovereignty but they want to make that idea so outrageous
[02:41:46.040 --> 02:41:53.040]  so crazy that they can demonize anyone that even raises the point they want us
[02:41:53.040 --> 02:41:58.480]  bullied in to total and complete submissions we're gonna start back over
[02:41:58.480 --> 02:42:03.360]  as soon as we get good audio with mr. Stone normally he has pretty good
[02:42:03.360 --> 02:42:07.440]  audio and video but today that is not happening via the miracle of Skype and
[02:42:07.440 --> 02:42:12.680]  technology more evil things that capitalism helped innovate for us I
[02:42:12.680 --> 02:42:15.960]  love watching the socialists and communist rallies as they wear designer
[02:42:15.960 --> 02:42:21.840]  clothes pull up in New Jaguars and wave their $400 smartphones in the year and
[02:42:21.840 --> 02:42:26.920]  then you talk to them and their parents are usually executives at companies but
[02:42:26.920 --> 02:42:30.640]  their parents are very proud of them yes you will be the rulers because they know
[02:42:30.640 --> 02:42:36.280]  we're going into the communitarian age now so it is just unspeakable what's
[02:42:36.280 --> 02:42:40.160]  unfolding do we have stone back all right let's start over with Roger Stone
[02:42:40.160 --> 02:42:44.760]  Roger getting back into this you know the Washington Post we can pull the
[02:42:44.760 --> 02:42:48.240]  article up they ask should Donald Trump be held responsible for violence in his
[02:42:48.240 --> 02:42:52.320]  rallies when move on is admittedly doing this but he keeps saying Bernie
[02:42:52.320 --> 02:42:55.640]  Bernie I know they had Bernie signs I know that you know that's easy to say
[02:42:55.640 --> 02:43:01.640]  but you had a guy in the meeting this is David Brock how big a deal is that I
[02:43:01.640 --> 02:43:06.640]  think I think Trump has more recently amended his Twitter feed that he's
[02:43:06.640 --> 02:43:10.840]  correctly pointing this at the Clinton machine because that's where the brain
[02:43:10.840 --> 02:43:16.600]  blame belongs as I said earlier the three major funders of the attack in the
[02:43:16.600 --> 02:43:22.600]  by protesters in Chicago are Soros and then David Brock although that's really
[02:43:22.600 --> 02:43:28.680]  Soros's money so move on media matters for money as I like to call it and then
[02:43:28.680 --> 02:43:35.760]  finally Jonathan Lewis the mysterious and reclusive heir to the progressive
[02:43:35.760 --> 02:43:41.080]  insurance fortune Peter Lewis his late father funding all kinds of left-wing
[02:43:41.080 --> 02:43:45.720]  schemes these are the ringleaders and the Finnean seers of this false
[02:43:45.720 --> 02:43:53.280]  flag attack on Trump and their goal is to fold one to split off those economic
[02:43:53.280 --> 02:43:58.320]  voters who are currently for Bernie but could very well end up with Trump because
[02:43:58.320 --> 02:44:02.920]  the international trade deals have put these folks out of work have destroyed
[02:44:02.920 --> 02:44:08.200]  their livelihood and they figured it out Bill and Hillary pushed in after now
[02:44:08.200 --> 02:44:11.400]  suddenly that she's running for president she says oh she was she's
[02:44:11.400 --> 02:44:15.800]  changed her mind about NASA well she won't change her mind about TPP or any
[02:44:15.800 --> 02:44:20.520]  of the upcoming international global trade deals she cannot be trusted on
[02:44:20.520 --> 02:44:25.400]  this issue and then secondarily they want to brand Trump as I wrote for
[02:44:25.400 --> 02:44:31.640]  Breitbart as a bigot a racist prone to violence this is an effort to alienate
[02:44:31.640 --> 02:44:35.640]  those blue collar voters that we're talking about who are for Bernie today
[02:44:35.640 --> 02:44:42.360]  which could end up being for Trump how is the overall fight going Roger right
[02:44:42.360 --> 02:44:46.520]  now clearly they're shaving votes around the state the state of Texas now
[02:44:46.520 --> 02:44:50.400]  admits they can't certify the election but I'm sure the RNC will just do it at
[02:44:50.400 --> 02:44:54.240]  the convention they're admitting fraud in Ohio I mean it's all coming out that
[02:44:54.240 --> 02:44:58.640]  there's fraud going on to shave points so that Trump doesn't get a clear
[02:44:58.640 --> 02:45:02.200]  majority and so they can sell the idea of a broker convention that you first
[02:45:02.200 --> 02:45:07.240]  warned of yeah it's interesting how much of this stuff was first revealed on
[02:45:07.240 --> 02:45:13.600]  info wars.com the Texas feeling the Kansas voter fraud the the main voter
[02:45:13.600 --> 02:45:19.400]  fraud the irregular irregularities in Hawaii in Ohio and trust me you're
[02:45:19.400 --> 02:45:25.560]  gonna have problems tomorrow in Florida the Trump ballot security project I'm
[02:45:25.560 --> 02:45:30.720]  working with is preparing a lawsuit to overturn the results of the Ohio primary
[02:45:30.720 --> 02:45:35.280]  in the event that John Kasich wins and we have a very strong lawsuit based on
[02:45:35.280 --> 02:45:40.520]  the the format of the ballot which we believe was designed specifically to
[02:45:40.520 --> 02:45:46.040]  disadvantage Trump there's a high probability that we would challenge the
[02:45:46.040 --> 02:45:51.760]  seeding of the text delegates because they were elected through fraud and that
[02:45:51.760 --> 02:45:56.160]  challenge could be brought in the credentials committee if necessary to
[02:45:56.160 --> 02:46:00.520]  the full convention if you want to read more on this or if you want to help or
[02:46:00.520 --> 02:46:07.600]  particularly if you know a voter fraud in Texas particularly go to stoptheseal.org
[02:46:07.600 --> 02:46:13.000]  one of our problems Alex is people call us and they tell us the specifics of
[02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:16.720]  their vote and how they filled the fraud it but they don't leave us their name
[02:46:16.720 --> 02:46:22.240]  and phone number we must have your name and phone number or email address so we
[02:46:22.240 --> 02:46:27.160]  can get back to you and document what happened so I call out to any of those
[02:46:27.160 --> 02:46:31.360]  anyone in the country who believes they had been defrauded or they were voting
[02:46:31.360 --> 02:46:37.000]  irregularities against Trump please contact us at stoptheseal.org
[02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:42.360]  leave your name so we can follow up how is Donald feeling right now he seems
[02:46:42.360 --> 02:46:45.560]  super energized I love the fact that when he was in Ohio and that guy rushed
[02:46:45.560 --> 02:46:49.880]  the stage that says he wants to kill Trump so he's a loving hero such a man
[02:46:49.880 --> 02:46:53.680]  that Trump didn't run from him or jump on the ground like most presidential
[02:46:53.680 --> 02:46:56.960]  candidates would the Secret Service tried to shield him and jump on him he
[02:46:56.960 --> 02:47:00.080]  pushed him out of the way like you wanted to fight the guy I would absolutely
[02:47:00.080 --> 02:47:03.120]  love to have one of those pieces of trash trying to climb up on the stage I
[02:47:03.120 --> 02:47:07.680]  just kick him right in the nose yeah no Trump is a tough guy he's courageous he
[02:47:07.680 --> 02:47:11.720]  knows he's taking his life in his hands you can now see which I said on this
[02:47:11.720 --> 02:47:16.040]  show again that he is that he has been forced to wear a bulletproof proof vest
[02:47:16.040 --> 02:47:21.480]  obviously knows that a headshot is a whole different issue there's no
[02:47:21.480 --> 02:47:26.920]  question to save his country he's taking these enormous personal risks but he is
[02:47:26.920 --> 02:47:32.040]  pumped up he's energized and he realizes that more and more that this is
[02:47:32.040 --> 02:47:37.720]  a united globalist phenomena you'll notice that Cruz and Rubio in case they
[02:47:37.720 --> 02:47:43.480]  sided with the Chicago protesters they attacked Trump for incited violence by
[02:47:43.480 --> 02:47:47.960]  speaking the blunt truth so we know where they stand instead of defending free
[02:47:47.960 --> 02:47:52.920]  speech and the First Amendment they piled on with sorrows that's because at
[02:47:52.920 --> 02:47:57.120]  the end of the day they too are globalists I know Ted Cruz does a great job
[02:47:57.120 --> 02:48:00.360]  of sounding like a constitutional conservative but look at his background
[02:48:00.360 --> 02:48:05.720]  he's a Bush man and he and his wife are both Bush Quizlet exactly and Trump
[02:48:05.720 --> 02:48:09.240]  does whatever he wants he's been his own guy he's manipulated the political
[02:48:09.240 --> 02:48:13.400]  system legally but he's not been part of it doesn't go to the CFR meetings he
[02:48:13.400 --> 02:48:16.680]  doesn't hang out with all these people I didn't like him saying hey I met with
[02:48:16.680 --> 02:48:20.040]  Haas but I mean I I mean I get it if Haas wanted to meet with me I meet with
[02:48:20.040 --> 02:48:23.560]  them as well doesn't mean I'm gonna join them but he but the Cruz comes out of
[02:48:23.560 --> 02:48:27.840]  their loins his wife comes out of the bushes he does Goldman Sachs top of the
[02:48:27.840 --> 02:48:33.960]  pyramid your articles on Daily Caller who is the real Heidi Nelson Cruz and
[02:48:33.960 --> 02:48:38.520]  it's a very very important article what about this other one breaking a Ted Cruz
[02:48:38.520 --> 02:48:43.040]  sex scandal appears to be looming what's the word on that well this is this is
[02:48:43.040 --> 02:48:48.160]  out there and it remains to be seen there are allegations about about
[02:48:48.160 --> 02:48:51.800]  Senator Cruz and various women none of this has been proven I want to say that
[02:48:51.800 --> 02:48:57.400]  for the record but there are a number of major major news outlets we're talking
[02:48:57.400 --> 02:49:03.320]  about mainstream media outlets chasing these rumors now it'll be interested to
[02:49:03.320 --> 02:49:07.520]  see whether any of this makes print I'm not going to malign the senator with
[02:49:07.520 --> 02:49:13.360]  specifics because at this point they are just allegations it is part and parcel
[02:49:13.360 --> 02:49:19.120]  of the Washington cabal though these senators begin to believe that they are
[02:49:19.120 --> 02:49:25.160]  that they have some kind of an oculation they believe they're above the law the
[02:49:25.160 --> 02:49:32.040]  power the money the women the sex it all comes as part of the package so it
[02:49:32.040 --> 02:49:35.320]  remains to be seen whether this story breaks through to the mainstream media
[02:49:35.320 --> 02:49:42.120]  but I have talked to at least three newspapers who contacted me to ask me
[02:49:42.120 --> 02:49:46.440]  what I knew about some of the details let's leave it there so the media is
[02:49:46.440 --> 02:49:51.480]  digging around here's what I have to say about it I like him a family man's not
[02:49:51.480 --> 02:49:57.000]  outrun around his wife and kids okay but they better not make an issue out of
[02:49:57.000 --> 02:50:00.960]  this or Trump having divorces or Trump having girlfriends or anybody when
[02:50:00.960 --> 02:50:05.000]  Hillary has an honor Raj of women she's known to sleep with and stay in the
[02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:09.240]  same hotel so if they don't go after her cheating on her husband I don't want to
[02:50:09.240 --> 02:50:14.480]  hear it but in this upside-down world you watch the crime is that Ted Cruz
[02:50:14.480 --> 02:50:18.600]  wasn't in bed with little kids now that was the case they'd make him you know
[02:50:18.600 --> 02:50:22.320]  speaker of the house or something like that or you know give him you know give
[02:50:22.320 --> 02:50:25.520]  him something like aster to job and I mean that's where I'm going with this
[02:50:25.520 --> 02:50:31.520]  stone but we shall see it remains to be seen whether they broke at this point I

[02:54:15.760 --> 02:54:21.800]  blitzing through masses of news in the fourth hour I'm Alex Jones your host
[02:54:21.800 --> 02:54:26.200]  Roger Stone is our guest look at this headline on drudgerport.com
[02:54:26.200 --> 02:54:31.280]  GOP senator panicked establishment losing control look at that big old
[02:54:31.280 --> 02:54:36.640]  headline and that's exactly what's going on in the GOP establishment so
[02:54:36.640 --> 02:54:44.520]  arrogant people like Mitch McConnell will get up on television and they will
[02:54:44.520 --> 02:54:54.520]  openly say that they'll just give it to Hillary so they'll steal your votes
[02:54:54.520 --> 02:54:58.720]  block him at the convention and then give it to Hillary they'll openly rob
[02:54:58.720 --> 02:55:04.200]  you people say oh cuz Trump might be dangerous we know they're dangerous so
[02:55:04.200 --> 02:55:07.880]  there's a major disconnect by these people
[02:55:09.200 --> 02:55:14.360]  meanwhile K6 Pro Obama trade a death warrant for Ohio manufacturing you got
[02:55:14.360 --> 02:55:19.600]  cut off by the break Roger in the four minutes we have left now or five minutes
[02:55:19.600 --> 02:55:24.760]  how is Trump really doing in the campaign what do we need to watch most
[02:55:24.760 --> 02:55:30.520]  closely and whether other tidbits that we should be getting into well Alex I
[02:55:30.520 --> 02:55:35.520]  really think the attack on Trump is campaign in Chicago is backfired very
[02:55:35.520 --> 02:55:42.240]  badly just as the the establishment wing of the party was not able to stop the
[02:55:42.240 --> 02:55:48.160]  inexorable March of Barry water in 1964 we're in an analogous situation where the
[02:55:48.160 --> 02:55:52.960]  attacks of the Pope of the Chinese government of Mexican former president
[02:55:52.960 --> 02:55:58.680]  Vincent a fox of Mitt Romney of the case three lobbyists this is all
[02:55:58.680 --> 02:56:03.640]  backfiring this is fueling Trump's drive for the nomination I would predict you
[02:56:03.640 --> 02:56:07.840]  right now he wins Florida by double digits most the polls showing in single
[02:56:07.840 --> 02:56:16.080]  digits 25% of those who have already passed a cast absentee balance did not
[02:56:16.080 --> 02:56:23.680]  vote two years ago and 15% did not vote four years ago at all so this tell you
[02:56:23.680 --> 02:56:28.080]  again definitively the trooper Trump's bringing thousands of new people to the
[02:56:28.080 --> 02:56:33.200]  process secondarily most of these polls that you see are taken off
[02:56:33.200 --> 02:56:39.200]  existing voter lists in which those and they're pulling those and Trump's
[02:56:39.200 --> 02:56:42.840]  bringing in people that have not ever voted or haven't voted in 20 years that's
[02:56:42.840 --> 02:56:48.960]  that's true therefore virtually every poll you see is understating his strength
[02:56:48.960 --> 02:56:53.840]  by between five and seven points because they're not figuring in the new
[02:56:53.840 --> 02:56:57.760]  voters and so they're telling us he's gonna lose so they try to steal it we
[02:56:57.760 --> 02:57:02.560]  might believe it but but if you have a landslide it's hard to steal well and
[02:57:02.560 --> 02:57:07.160]  also it's a it's just an ethical mistake based on the fact that they
[02:57:07.160 --> 02:57:12.120]  misunderstand who is voting which is why I believe he could eat out a win in
[02:57:12.120 --> 02:57:17.000]  Ohio I know personally because I've talked to a couple registrars and voters
[02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:21.240]  out there who are friends sure they are having real problems with Democrats
[02:57:21.240 --> 02:57:25.760]  crowding the polls and filling out the paperwork to switch parties and vote in
[02:57:25.760 --> 02:57:31.040]  the poll show that let me ask you this question then in closing what other
[02:57:31.040 --> 02:57:34.760]  attacks should we look for are they gonna try to wind up some loon have the
[02:57:34.760 --> 02:57:38.520]  New York Times having Saturday Night Live say killing are they just trying to
[02:57:38.520 --> 02:57:43.480]  hype it and hoping some loan nut kills Trump okay that could be it but I'll
[02:57:43.480 --> 02:57:47.360]  tell you what is definitely coming there will be an attack on Trump that will say
[02:57:47.360 --> 02:57:53.000]  that as a developer and builder he regularly bought concrete from a
[02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:58.880]  company controlled by the mob and fat Tony Solerno a gangster here's what
[02:57:58.880 --> 02:58:04.120]  they won't tell you the city of New York also bought concrete from them so did
[02:58:04.120 --> 02:58:08.760]  the state of New York so did every other major developer in New York because
[02:58:08.760 --> 02:58:14.360]  they had a New York business license see they don't tell you that part and why
[02:58:14.360 --> 02:58:17.880]  did everybody buy concrete from this one company because they were union
[02:58:17.880 --> 02:58:23.920]  friendly so Trump has done nothing wrong but the insinuation will be oh he's
[02:58:23.920 --> 02:58:28.320]  mobbed up he bought concrete from this one company they're not gonna tell you
[02:58:28.320 --> 02:58:31.720]  that so did the state of New York so did I tell you what we're back in 70
[02:58:31.720 --> 02:58:34.240]  seconds do five more minutes with me because I've got a couple more questions
[02:58:34.240 --> 02:58:39.520]  in PJ are Paul Joseph Watson is coming up stay with us that's that's a joke I

[03:00:09.640 --> 03:00:24.120]  radio network the system's desperate again the washington post yesterday said
[03:00:24.120 --> 03:00:29.440]  hey should should be fine or fee or sue or arrest Donald trump it's his fault you
[03:00:29.440 --> 03:00:33.000]  know that he claims we should have some sovereignty it's his fault he's causing
[03:00:33.000 --> 03:00:40.040]  all the problems meanwhile ice has released 123 illegals that committed 125
[03:00:40.040 --> 03:00:45.120]  murders that story from the examiner that's just one story this is totally
[03:00:45.120 --> 03:00:51.240]  crazy let me shift gears into this subject in closing Roger stone we bring
[03:00:51.240 --> 03:00:56.640]  up the mainstream media investigating whether Ted Cruz has got girlfriends on
[03:00:56.640 --> 03:01:02.480]  the side and and what I said here is I'm not giving that a pass what I am saying
[03:01:02.480 --> 03:01:09.440]  is how can the clinton's bill be raping women hillary covering it up hillary
[03:01:09.440 --> 03:01:13.160]  with all these women around her you know with staying her hotel room you know
[03:01:13.160 --> 03:01:17.040]  she's known bisexual probably just a lesbian whatever I don't even get into
[03:01:17.040 --> 03:01:23.200]  that issue but why being a protected group sexually like a lesbian is she
[03:01:23.200 --> 03:01:27.240]  allowed to then shoot on her husband but if Ted Cruz is shooting on his wife then
[03:01:27.240 --> 03:01:33.200]  it's bad she I mean it's like crazy how the left gets passes on everything
[03:01:33.200 --> 03:01:37.240]  drudge is always you're pointing out who her girlfriends are and the media acts
[03:01:37.240 --> 03:01:41.080]  like he's making that up it's known that she's seen more tail than a you know
[03:01:41.080 --> 03:01:45.160]  toilet seat so I'm asking you right now where do you think all this shakes out
[03:01:45.160 --> 03:01:49.160]  in the election them coming after Trump I know he's owned it you know getting
[03:01:49.160 --> 03:01:52.560]  off his jet with a bunch of beautiful women from the pageant I know he's you
[03:01:52.560 --> 03:01:56.440]  know in between the you know divorces had girlfriends big deal you know the guy
[03:01:56.440 --> 03:02:03.360]  doesn't hide it in three minutes closing remarks I'm concerned about that down
[03:02:03.360 --> 03:02:08.480]  the road yeah you know I think that there are greater concerns I have a
[03:02:08.480 --> 03:02:12.000]  greater concern for his personal safety to be honest with you because this is a
[03:02:12.000 --> 03:02:16.760]  non-starter there's no question whatsoever the Trump had numerous beautiful
[03:02:16.760 --> 03:02:21.800]  and glamorous girlfriends in between his marriages but the issue here is not
[03:02:21.800 --> 03:02:26.200]  marital infidelity and it's not adultery in the case of the court is it's much
[03:02:26.200 --> 03:02:31.840]  something much darker it's rape it's sexual assault in which Hillary has been
[03:02:31.840 --> 03:02:36.440]  an accessory in all of those sex crimes because as you know and as I established
[03:02:36.440 --> 03:02:40.560]  in my book the court is war on women Hillary is the one who runs campaign to
[03:02:40.560 --> 03:02:45.720]  intimidate and bully and terrorize these women out of testifying or out of going
[03:02:45.720 --> 03:02:50.240]  public sure let me ask you this trap is winning by marriage then shifting out of
[03:02:50.240 --> 03:02:54.800]  that but back into his safety he's winning the electronic air war these
[03:02:54.800 --> 03:02:59.200]  these rallies are great but this is where they're gonna try to cap him if
[03:02:59.200 --> 03:03:02.360]  you're worried about his safety he's got a lot of courage I guess we're just
[03:03:02.360 --> 03:03:06.880]  rolling the dice here yeah I don't think we have a choice he's not going to hide
[03:03:06.880 --> 03:03:12.560]  it's not his nature and he's not going to tower it's just not his nature so you
[03:03:12.560 --> 03:03:17.320]  know we pray for him every day we pray for his safety because this is this is
[03:03:17.320 --> 03:03:22.040]  the last best hope for Western civilization this is the last best hope
[03:03:22.040 --> 03:03:26.440]  for the sovereignty of the American people is Trump perfect no he's not
[03:03:26.440 --> 03:03:30.640]  perfect well I'll say this it makes me like him even more that he went at the
[03:03:30.640 --> 03:03:34.320]  attacker and then he's not a coward and I know full well the Secret Service is
[03:03:34.320 --> 03:03:37.200]  telling him stop these big rallies there's too many people do small
[03:03:37.200 --> 03:03:41.320]  town halls that the other candidates do because they're cowards not just crowds
[03:03:41.320 --> 03:03:45.960]  but they don't have and he's saying no I'm gonna do it so that's a real manly
[03:03:45.960 --> 03:03:52.400]  trait right there mr. Stone well look at this video of this fellow Thomas D
[03:03:52.400 --> 03:03:58.840]  the Massimo the guy who attacked him and it is chilling he's waving and oozing
[03:03:58.840 --> 03:04:02.160]  yeah tell us where to find that video oh where'd you find that particular video
[03:04:02.160 --> 03:04:06.520]  I will I will have to forward it to you I got it from a former congressman from
[03:04:06.520 --> 03:04:09.800]  most Carolina this morning great patriot Billy I know I saw stuff about him
[03:04:09.800 --> 03:04:13.440]  talking about ISIS al Qaeda and seeing that and I looked and I'm gonna I'm gonna

[03:04:16.320 --> 03:04:19.360]  mean I've seen I've seen it in text I haven't seen it yet well he said he
[03:04:19.360 --> 03:04:24.440]  wanted to kill from why isn't he in trouble yeah it's extraordinary I
[03:04:24.440 --> 03:04:29.880]  look I apologize today for not having our visual fee I am I just spoke to 500
[03:04:29.880 --> 03:04:33.840]  women at lunch about Hillary Clinton I'm with a good friend of yours Ed Dean who
[03:04:33.840 --> 03:04:41.960]  is the king of Florida radio and the palpable buzz here is Trump wins Florida
[03:04:41.960 --> 03:04:46.320]  big double digits so they're gonna try to kill him or say he's a mobster and

[03:04:49.800 --> 03:04:52.880]  got to get behind him Roger Stone thanks for the time great job we'll talk to

[03:04:56.720 --> 03:05:01.800]  the exclusives you give us action hero Jean-Claude van Damme told a French
[03:05:01.800 --> 03:05:06.320]  television political show that the Rothschild and Rockefeller families
[03:05:06.320 --> 03:05:12.080]  will not let Donald Trump win the presidency because he is an anti-globalist
[03:05:12.080 --> 03:05:17.680]  candidate appearing on the Le Grand Journal van Damme said he was aware of
[03:05:17.680 --> 03:05:22.760]  who is really shaping US presidential elections some of the other participants
[03:05:22.760 --> 03:05:28.120]  in the debate looked stunned as van Damme continued to say that the Rothschilds
[03:05:28.120 --> 03:05:34.080]  rose to power in 1827 and they now control and dominate entire continents
[03:05:34.080 --> 03:05:39.120]  and he says Donald Trump is not going to win the election he went on to make a
[03:05:39.120 --> 03:05:43.920]  distinction between lobbyists that control the other candidates and people
[03:05:43.920 --> 03:05:48.520]  like Donald Trump who is truly anti-establishment and you can learn

[03:07:58.280 --> 03:08:23.000]  We are back it's the fourth hour overdrive of the Alex Jones show with me
[03:08:23.000 --> 03:08:27.560]  Paul Joseph Watson and as you heard Alex has been covering the latest Trump
[03:08:27.560 --> 03:08:31.040]  news there with Roger Stove specifically and this is what I'm gonna
[03:08:31.040 --> 03:08:36.960]  talk about in this hour how the media is fermenting an environment which could
[03:08:36.960 --> 03:08:41.840]  lead to assassination attempt against Donald Trump now we've been talking
[03:08:41.840 --> 03:08:45.080]  about this for months we've been talking about Trump having secret service
[03:08:45.080 --> 03:08:50.840]  protection back in October last year of course Roger Stone revealed recently that
[03:08:50.840 --> 03:08:55.960]  Trump wears a bulletproof vest at all times during his public events because
[03:08:55.960 --> 03:09:02.200]  these threats are very real you can go on Twitter at any time of the day and
[03:09:02.200 --> 03:09:08.040]  find hundreds and thousands of people saying either that Trump should be
[03:09:08.040 --> 03:09:12.320]  assassinated somebody should quote take one for the team and assassinate
[03:09:12.320 --> 03:09:18.560]  Trump or in some cases they say they're gonna do it directly now of course we've
[03:09:18.560 --> 03:09:23.200]  had this huge scandal about Twitter censoring conservatives for having the
[03:09:23.200 --> 03:09:29.760]  wrong political opinions banning them deleting their accounts these anti-
[03:09:29.760 --> 03:09:35.720]  Trump unhinged crazed extremists in almost every single case remain on
[03:09:35.720 --> 03:09:39.920]  Twitter nothing happens to them I've been highlighting several of these tweets
[03:09:39.920 --> 03:09:44.400]  over the last few days basically people saying somebody should assassinate
[03:09:44.400 --> 03:09:50.120]  Trump save America from fascism etc etc nothing happens to these people there
[03:09:50.120 --> 03:09:55.120]  was one instance where somebody found out the employment address the employment
[03:09:55.120 --> 03:09:59.320]  of this woman who was a nurse who was making violent threats against both
[03:09:59.320 --> 03:10:04.280]  Donald Trump and his family she got terminated from her job so there are
[03:10:04.280 --> 03:10:08.440]  consequences for some of this again I'm not forgetting people fired from their
[03:10:08.440 --> 03:10:13.680]  jobs I'm just for highlighting the sheer stupidity and how it completely
[03:10:13.680 --> 03:10:18.360]  counters the media narrative which we've seen all along that Donald Trump
[03:10:18.360 --> 03:10:24.240]  himself is responsible for the violence that we saw in Chicago on Friday night
[03:10:24.240 --> 03:10:29.600]  so just to introduce this let's go to the video the truth about what happened in
[03:10:29.600 --> 03:10:34.480]  Chicago the riot during the Trump event that was cancelled on Friday night
[03:10:34.480 --> 03:10:39.440]  here's that clip crazed violent Bernie Sanders supporters black lives matter
[03:10:39.440 --> 03:10:45.200]  extremists and other leftist agitators crashed a Donald Trump rally in Chicago
[03:10:45.200 --> 03:10:51.360]  last night unhinged mobs assaulted people attacked police tore up signs
[03:10:51.360 --> 03:10:59.440]  blocked ambulances fired guns in the air and threatened to rape women oh but
[03:10:59.440 --> 03:11:03.920]  that's just their free speech cried the media and Bernie Sanders supporters
[03:11:03.920 --> 03:11:09.520]  really so if Donald Trump voters had crashed a Bernie Sanders event assaulted
[03:11:09.520 --> 03:11:15.080]  his supporters attacked police tore up signs blocks ambulances fired guns in the
[03:11:15.080 --> 03:11:20.640]  air and threatened to rape women you'd say that was just their free speech look
[03:11:20.640 --> 03:11:26.200]  at this Bernie supporter expressing his free speech he's an anti-violence
[03:11:26.200 --> 03:11:31.800]  activist after all here's another peaceful Bernie voter proudly threatening to
[03:11:31.800 --> 03:11:37.400]  physically attack Trump supporters here's a peaceful Bernie supporter flying a
[03:11:37.400 --> 03:11:42.520]  communist flag a political system responsible for the deaths of hundreds
[03:11:42.520 --> 03:11:48.580]  of millions of people mmm so peaceful here are black lives matter supporters
[03:11:48.580 --> 03:11:54.640]  wishing that someone had tried to assassinate Trump in Chicago look who
[03:11:54.640 --> 03:11:59.280]  showed up to voice his support for the anti-trump crowd domestic terrorist
[03:11:59.280 --> 03:12:05.400]  Bill Ayers and who did Meg and Kelly blame for all this Donald Trump Trump's
[03:12:05.400 --> 03:12:10.760]  own rhetoric at the at his rallies and in particular some of the violence we
[03:12:10.760 --> 03:12:15.440]  have seen at his rallies some of the violent clashes with protesters who
[03:12:15.440 --> 03:12:20.180]  often are African-American has fed into what we're seeing here tonight who did
[03:12:20.180 --> 03:12:26.120]  Rachel Maddow blame Donald Trump when before this rally started when we saw
[03:12:26.120 --> 03:12:29.720]  what was happening in the streets outside this event and we saw what Donald
[03:12:29.720 --> 03:12:33.520]  Trump had done to incite violence and I'm saying that deliberately to incite
[03:12:33.520 --> 03:12:38.960]  violence from his event earlier today in St. Louis who did Ted Cruz blame Donald
[03:12:38.960 --> 03:12:44.600]  Trump but in any campaign responsibility starts at the top any candidate is
[03:12:44.600 --> 03:12:53.040]  responsible for the culture of the campaign you create an environment that
[03:12:53.040 --> 03:13:00.720]  only encourages this sort of nasty discord who did Marco Rubio blame you
[03:13:00.720 --> 03:13:05.440]  guessed it Donald Trump there are real consequences the consequences to the
[03:13:05.440 --> 03:13:08.680]  word though someone speaks whether there's a presidential candidate or
[03:13:08.680 --> 03:13:13.320]  ultimately as a president Donald Trump's rhetoric is to blame I guess the
[03:13:13.320 --> 03:13:19.040]  Bernie supporters were offended just like the Charlie Hebdo Jihadists were
[03:13:19.040 --> 03:13:25.280]  offended poor babies listen if over a thousand violent angry Trump supporters
[03:13:25.280 --> 03:13:30.520]  behaved anything like this do you think the media would describe them as
[03:13:30.520 --> 03:13:37.040]  legitimate protesters oh but they're protesting against fascism by silencing
[03:13:37.040 --> 03:13:40.160]  people's free speech with intimidation tactics and threatening them with
[03:13:40.160 --> 03:13:45.840]  violence if they vote a certain way yeah I'm not sure if you knew this but that's
[03:13:45.840 --> 03:13:51.400]  actually a hallmark of fascism these are the people who will riot and burn
[03:13:51.400 --> 03:13:57.080]  American cities to the ground if Trump is elected president why because they've
[03:13:57.080 --> 03:14:01.560]  been given legitimacy by a mainstream media who said that looting and rioting
[03:14:01.560 --> 03:14:07.880]  was an acceptable form of protest after Ferguson black lives matter has been
[03:14:07.880 --> 03:14:14.000]  given credence despite the fact that its ideological inspiration is a convicted
[03:14:14.000 --> 03:14:19.880]  cop killer on the FBI's most wanted terrorist list despite the fact that its
[03:14:19.880 --> 03:14:25.560]  supporters have called for killing cops plotted to bomb police stations and have
[03:14:25.560 --> 03:14:31.280]  actually killed police officers this is the group that Hillary Clinton promised
[03:14:31.280 --> 03:14:38.920]  to change laws to appease whether you love or loathe Donald Trump encouraging
[03:14:38.920 --> 03:14:46.080]  this kind of mayhem is a recipe for disaster so that was the video I put
[03:14:46.080 --> 03:14:51.200]  out on Saturday just a few hours after this news broke about what was happening
[03:14:51.200 --> 03:14:57.840]  in Chicago they got over 500,000 views at the current state of play now that was
[03:14:57.840 --> 03:15:02.080]  what happened in Chicago of course this was before the crazed domestic extremist
[03:15:02.080 --> 03:15:06.920]  who has been celebrated by the social justice worries in the media tried to
[03:15:06.920 --> 03:15:10.440]  jump the stage and attack Trump but he was just going to say Trump was a
[03:15:10.440 --> 03:15:14.160]  racist and you can believe him because he seems like a perfectly calm and
[03:15:14.160 --> 03:15:19.240]  reasonable person but that was just after the incident in Chicago with the
[03:15:19.240 --> 03:15:24.080]  Bernie Sanders supporters crashing the Donald Trump rally again you know firing
[03:15:24.080 --> 03:15:28.200]  guns in the air blocking ambulances assaulting people all the footage is
[03:15:28.200 --> 03:15:33.240]  out there and we had this huge media narrative come together immediately
[03:15:33.240 --> 03:15:38.000]  after you'll notice this secretive meeting and organized by the American
[03:15:38.000 --> 03:15:43.320]  Enterprise Institute on a remote island off of Georgia where they coordinated on
[03:15:43.320 --> 03:15:48.880]  how they were going to stop Trump then we had this coordinated media narrative
[03:15:48.880 --> 03:15:52.320]  despite the fact all this violence was coming from the left was coming from
[03:15:52.320 --> 03:15:57.400]  Bernie Sanders supporters that it was Trump's fault and this narrative
[03:15:57.400 --> 03:16:03.440]  continued on Sunday evening even after the crazed radical tried to assault
[03:16:03.440 --> 03:16:08.520]  Trump with the Democratic Town Hall event with Bernie Sanders and Hillary
[03:16:08.520 --> 03:16:13.520]  Clinton let's go to their comments about Trump himself being responsible for the
[03:16:13.520 --> 03:16:19.240]  violence here's that video Trump said that he is prepared to pay the legal
[03:16:19.240 --> 03:16:26.000]  costs of an individual who sucker punched somebody at a recent event he's
[03:16:26.000 --> 03:16:32.680]  gonna pay the legal fees of somebody who committed a terrible act of violence
[03:16:32.680 --> 03:16:39.200]  what that means is that Donald Trump is literally inciting violence with his
[03:16:39.200 --> 03:16:44.320]  supporters he is saying if you go out and beat somebody up that's okay I'll pay
[03:16:44.320 --> 03:16:50.560]  the legal fees he actually incites violence in the way that he urges his
[03:16:50.560 --> 03:16:56.680]  audience on you know talking about punching people offering to pay legal
[03:16:56.680 --> 03:17:04.520]  bills and then on the specifics you know we know that he has been incredibly
[03:17:04.520 --> 03:17:12.560]  bigoted towards so many groups he talks about deporting 11 12 million
[03:17:12.560 --> 03:17:17.280]  immigrants were a nation built on immigrants he talks about preventing
[03:17:17.280 --> 03:17:22.480]  Muslims from coming into our country we believe in religious freedom there's
[03:17:22.480 --> 03:17:29.560]  just so much of what he's doing that I think we all have to reject so they
[03:17:29.560 --> 03:17:33.440]  have Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders continuing with the narrative that
[03:17:33.440 --> 03:17:37.080]  Trump himself is responsible for the violence of course Clinton their
[03:17:37.080 --> 03:17:41.480]  outright brazenly lied and said that Trump wanted to deport 12 million
[03:17:41.480 --> 03:17:46.560]  immigrants he wants to deport illegal immigrants there is a distinction to be
[03:17:46.560 --> 03:17:51.040]  made there so she lied in that instance and then again they jumped on board the
[03:17:51.040 --> 03:17:57.280]  bandwagon demonizing Trump feeding into this media narrative that he's the one
[03:17:57.280 --> 03:18:02.520]  inciting violence and this has become the big story across all the media
[03:18:02.520 --> 03:18:08.520]  networks all of which have completely ignored the real instances where people
[03:18:08.520 --> 03:18:15.080]  are inciting violence on a daily basis against Trump which is on social media
[03:18:15.080 --> 03:18:21.560]  you can go right now to Twitter type in the search box assassinate Trump in
[03:18:21.560 --> 03:18:26.760]  quotation marks see how many tweets there are just over the past 24 hours
[03:18:26.760 --> 03:18:32.440]  alone then compare it to a search for assassinate Hillary or assassinate
[03:18:32.440 --> 03:18:38.480]  Bernie it's literally a hundred to one but again it's Trump that's inciting
[03:18:38.480 --> 03:18:42.840]  violence yes the comments that he makes about you know I want to punch the
[03:18:42.840 --> 03:18:46.880]  the agitator in the face when he interrupts his rally they're silly and
[03:18:46.880 --> 03:18:53.360]  stupid comments but they pale they pale in significance and volume to the actual
[03:18:53.360 --> 03:18:59.280]  direct death threats that Donald Trump receives on a daily basis on an hourly
[03:18:59.280 --> 03:19:03.880]  basis sometimes it's a hundred an hour especially immediately after his
[03:19:03.880 --> 03:19:09.800]  speeches his political events now we have Trump supporters of course we had
[03:19:09.800 --> 03:19:13.400]  the t-shirt that somebody was wearing in Chicago on Friday night you know if
[03:19:13.400 --> 03:19:17.160]  you're gonna vote for Trump you're gonna get jumped because you can't have your
[03:19:17.160 --> 03:19:20.480]  own political opinion you can't have your own democratic choice because we're
[03:19:20.480 --> 03:19:26.240]  anti fascist protesters so we're gonna protest by acting like fascists and
[03:19:26.240 --> 03:19:29.960]  saying we will violently attack you if you disagree with us politically because
[03:19:29.960 --> 03:19:33.440]  that's liberal and trendy you've got that going on and now you've got Trump
[03:19:33.440 --> 03:19:39.000]  supporters being harassed being hit with death threats themselves simply again
[03:19:39.000 --> 03:19:43.120]  for saying they will vote for Trump not only have we had yard signs being torn
[03:19:43.120 --> 03:19:46.760]  ripped up the face now we've got people getting direct death threats we'll get
[03:19:46.760 --> 03:19:51.600]  more into it in the next segment on the Alex Jones show live 4th hour overdrive

[03:24:17.080 --> 03:24:21.680]  talking about Hillary Clinton Bernie Sanders the entirety of the media the
[03:24:21.680 --> 03:24:26.720]  political class demonizing Donald Trump saying that he's to blame for the
[03:24:26.720 --> 03:24:32.960]  violent rhetoric for the violence we saw in Chicago when Donald Trump himself
[03:24:32.960 --> 03:24:38.760]  is hit by a deluge of death threats on a daily basis we had the Egyptian student
[03:24:38.760 --> 03:24:43.720]  el Sayed recently basically agreed to be deported because of a threat that he
[03:24:43.720 --> 03:24:48.840]  made on Facebook quote I literally don't mind taking a lifetime sentence in
[03:24:48.840 --> 03:24:52.640]  jail for killing this guy I would actually be doing the whole world a
[03:24:52.640 --> 03:24:58.280]  favor he's basically being deported for that that's quite mild compared to some
[03:24:58.280 --> 03:25:03.040]  of what I see on Twitter every single day regarding death threats made against
[03:25:03.040 --> 03:25:10.160]  Donald Trump we had the guy try and jump the stage on Saturday saying that he
[03:25:10.160 --> 03:25:14.480]  planned this attack that he he was prepared to be a martyr he was treat
[03:25:14.480 --> 03:25:19.760]  it he was tweeting emoticons of a gun next to a head in reference to what he
[03:25:19.760 --> 03:25:25.080]  planned to do at this event now he was unharmed he was unarmed sorry he claimed
[03:25:25.080 --> 03:25:28.840]  he was gonna get up on the stage and call Donald Trump a racist how original
[03:25:28.840 --> 03:25:33.200]  but who knows what he was gonna do he was violent he was unhinged he's being
[03:25:33.200 --> 03:25:38.000]  pictured with gang bangers so who knows what he was gonna do but the point is
[03:25:38.000 --> 03:25:41.960]  Trump's getting these death threats people are being deported for these
[03:25:41.960 --> 03:25:46.080]  death threats in some instances there's no way they could find all these people
[03:25:46.080 --> 03:25:52.640]  because it's literally thousands a day and then we've got this out of WTOP.com
[03:25:52.640 --> 03:25:57.720]  local Trump supporters say she's facing harassment and vandalism someone has
[03:25:57.720 --> 03:26:01.520]  stolen the Donald Trump signs from her yard spray painted her house with
[03:26:01.520 --> 03:26:06.080]  messages and a motorcyclist stopped to threaten her life but the Gainesville
[03:26:06.080 --> 03:26:09.160]  Virginia woman says that whilst she's frightened and exhausted by the ordeal
[03:26:09.160 --> 03:26:14.360]  she won't be intimidated Judy Beatty is vowed to put up more Trump yard signs
[03:26:14.360 --> 03:26:18.200]  she says she's been told by Virginia State Police they will provide additional
[03:26:18.200 --> 03:26:22.440]  security measures I can't even tell you how hard it is to deal with something
[03:26:22.440 --> 03:26:26.120]  like this I feel like I'm very violated at this point and very threatened says
[03:26:26.120 --> 03:26:30.480]  Beatty she awoke Wednesday morning to find the Trump signs gone and her neat
[03:26:30.480 --> 03:26:34.800]  white house spray painted with the words revolution and can you see the new
[03:26:34.800 --> 03:26:39.520]  world through the tear gas quote I get all these nutcases riding by here going
[03:26:39.520 --> 03:26:46.520]  feel the burn I had one guy yesterday telling me I was going to die so she's
[03:26:46.520 --> 03:26:50.640]  being told that she's gonna die she's having a house vandalized by Bernie
[03:26:50.640 --> 03:26:54.840]  Sanders supporters I guess Donald Trump's to blame for that let's just blame
[03:26:54.840 --> 03:26:59.000]  Donald Trump because that's easier because it fits into this media narrative
[03:26:59.000 --> 03:27:03.640]  that's been promoted since Chicago on Friday night by both left and right
[03:27:03.640 --> 03:27:09.920]  Rachel Maddow Megan Kelly Ted Cruz Marco Rubio Bernie Sanders Hillary Clinton
[03:27:09.920 --> 03:27:15.520]  right across the board so again there's no louder progenitor of hateful
[03:27:15.520 --> 03:27:22.240]  vitriolic violent rhetoric than the anti-Trump crowd so why is Trump himself
[03:27:22.240 --> 03:27:28.120]  being blamed for this violent rhetoric is Fox News reporting on the deluge of
[03:27:28.120 --> 03:27:32.520]  death threats being made against Trump no they're too busy lying about a Trump
[03:27:32.520 --> 03:27:38.560]  campaign staffer who grabbed a woman by the arm and then Fox News and this woman
[03:27:38.560 --> 03:27:42.000]  this poor victim who was almost crying claimed that it was some kind of vicious
[03:27:42.000 --> 03:27:46.440]  assault before the video came out in fact we can roll this video now as I
[03:27:46.440 --> 03:27:51.800]  talk over it basically it's Donald Trump walking through a venue this Breitbart
[03:27:51.800 --> 03:27:56.320]  reporter she's now resigned is trying to ask him a question over and over again
[03:27:56.320 --> 03:28:02.280]  Trump walks by one of Trump's campaign staffers basically grabs her by the arm
[03:28:02.280 --> 03:28:07.400]  for about a split second and yes that's wrong he shouldn't have done that but
[03:28:07.400 --> 03:28:12.040]  the way they've overblown this she went on to Fox News she went on to Megan
[03:28:12.040 --> 03:28:16.960]  Kelly afterwards and said you know oh he almost threw me to the ground she
[03:28:16.960 --> 03:28:21.480]  portrayed it she characterized it as some kind of vicious assault you know
[03:28:21.480 --> 03:28:26.200]  like he was manhandling her like King Kong or something the famous scene where
[03:28:26.200 --> 03:28:31.560]  you know King Kong scoops up the lady she was trying to portray it as some kind
[03:28:31.560 --> 03:28:35.880]  of vicious attack she had a Washington Post eye witness he ginned it up because
[03:28:35.880 --> 03:28:40.800]  he wanted to get a story out of it and she said this is the worst thing that's
[03:28:40.800 --> 03:28:46.440]  ever happened to me apart from my father dying I mean watch the video clip you
[03:28:46.440 --> 03:28:51.280]  basically brushes pasta yes he might grab her arm for a split second and he
[03:28:51.280 --> 03:28:56.200]  shouldn't have done that but the way they've spun this before that video came
[03:28:56.200 --> 03:29:00.760]  out it's a complete hoax but they're doing it because it's part of this
[03:29:00.760 --> 03:29:05.280]  co-ordinate coordinated media campaign to claim that Trump is encouraging
[03:29:05.280 --> 03:29:10.000]  violence if they can demonize his campaign staffer as being some brutal
[03:29:10.000 --> 03:29:15.640]  bully who physically assaults women and tries to throw them to the ground which
[03:29:15.640 --> 03:29:19.360]  is what they claimed this was before the video came out proving them completely
[03:29:19.360 --> 03:29:25.520]  wrong then they can associate it with Trump they can claim it's caused by his
[03:29:25.520 --> 03:29:32.160]  hateful rhetoric while he's deluged by a thousand hateful death threats every day
[03:29:32.160 --> 03:29:36.240]  on Twitter while people are trying to jump the stage to attack him while his
[03:29:36.240 --> 03:29:41.240]  supporters how having their property defaced are being thrown death threats
[03:29:41.240 --> 03:29:45.520]  on a daily basis we'll get more into it after the break on the Alex Jones show
[03:29:45.520 --> 03:29:50.120]  live info wars dot com don't go away we're on the March the Empire's on the

[03:29:57.600 --> 03:30:02.800]  last week we reported on one Pablo Serrano Viterino an illegal alien who
[03:30:02.800 --> 03:30:05.440]  has been charged with killing his neighbor and three other men with an
[03:30:05.440 --> 03:30:09.080]  AK-47 now it has emerged that US immigration authorities had this man
[03:30:09.080 --> 03:30:13.400]  in custody twice last year and let him slip through their fingers it also just
[03:30:13.400 --> 03:30:17.160]  came out that ice revealed that 124 illegal immigrants released from jail
[03:30:17.160 --> 03:30:21.440]  by the Obama administration since 2010 have subsequently been charged with
[03:30:21.440 --> 03:30:24.680]  murder the report from the Center of Immigration Studies reads the criminal
[03:30:24.680 --> 03:30:27.680]  aliens released by ice in these years who had already been convicted of
[03:30:27.680 --> 03:30:31.280]  thousands of crimes are responsible for a significant crime spree in American
[03:30:31.280 --> 03:30:36.160]  communities including 124 homicides inexplicably ice is choosing to release

[03:33:32.040 --> 03:33:36.200]  claiming that she'd been viciously assaulted by this trump campaign
[03:33:36.200 --> 03:33:42.160]  staffer they didn't play the video which shows the actual incident where
[03:33:42.160 --> 03:33:47.280]  trump walks past she tries to ask him a couple of questions trump ignores this
[03:33:47.280 --> 03:33:52.600]  reporter so then this campaign staffer basically brushes her aside you know he
[03:33:52.600 --> 03:33:56.120]  grabs her arm she later showed some bruises who knows where they came from
[03:33:56.120 --> 03:34:00.960]  but it wasn't a vicious assault I mean let's be honest about this should they
[03:34:00.960 --> 03:34:06.240]  have apologized for it maybe but the way it was characterized by fox news and the
[03:34:06.240 --> 03:34:11.040]  way it was woven into this narrative that trump is this evil hitler like
[03:34:11.040 --> 03:34:16.200]  authoritarian that's encouraging people to attack anyone who questions him it
[03:34:16.200 --> 03:34:20.120]  was completely blown out of proportion and we can see the video again if we
[03:34:20.120 --> 03:34:24.680]  can play that video again this is the bright bar reporter who went on fox news
[03:34:24.680 --> 03:34:29.120]  almost broke down crying said that this was the the worst thing to happen in her
[03:34:29.120 --> 03:34:34.440]  entire life aside from her own father dying she but was basically brushed
[03:34:34.440 --> 03:34:37.960]  aside I mean if that's the worst thing the second worst thing that's happened
[03:34:37.960 --> 03:34:43.120]  to her in her entire life then she's probably had a pretty sweet life this
[03:34:43.120 --> 03:34:47.800]  was completely mischaracterized people started resigning from bright bar you
[03:34:47.800 --> 03:34:52.120]  had Ben Shapiro resigned you had Michelle Fields resigned you think you had
[03:34:52.120 --> 03:34:57.040]  another resignation today and again they characterized it as a vicious assault
[03:34:57.040 --> 03:35:02.040]  they're not reporting on the hundreds and thousands of tweets threatening to
[03:35:02.040 --> 03:35:06.400]  kill Donald Trump that's not violent rhetoric that's not hateful enough but
[03:35:06.400 --> 03:35:11.600]  somebody brushing aside a reporter and it's like the end of the world so fox
[03:35:11.600 --> 03:35:17.680]  news is not reporting on that CNN is not reporting on the violent death threats
[03:35:17.680 --> 03:35:22.640]  against Donald Trump on a daily basis they're too busy giving a platform to
[03:35:22.640 --> 03:35:27.960]  the extremist who tried to attack Trump in Ohio making him out to be a
[03:35:27.960 --> 03:35:33.000]  reasonable guy this is an individual who said that he was prepared to become a
[03:35:33.000 --> 03:35:38.320]  martyr while he was planning this attack he got up on Twitter the day before
[03:35:38.320 --> 03:35:43.080]  the day off said I've accepted the fact I'm gonna be a martyr tweeted an
[03:35:43.080 --> 03:35:48.320]  emoji of a gun being fired into someone's head the next day he's on CNN
[03:35:48.320 --> 03:35:54.680]  and he's perfectly reasonable he's a protester okay so imagine if a crazed
[03:35:54.680 --> 03:36:00.840]  right-wing extremist who called himself a martyr for his cause had tried to get
[03:36:00.840 --> 03:36:06.720]  up on stage and accost Hillary Clinton would CNN be trying to legitimize and
[03:36:06.720 --> 03:36:10.920]  humanize the guy would they call him a protester you know wife one of the
[03:36:10.920 --> 03:36:16.240]  Oregon militia members had got up on stage and tried to you know hijack
[03:36:16.240 --> 03:36:23.440]  Bernie Sanders platform would CNN call him a legitimate protester no but
[03:36:23.440 --> 03:36:28.280]  they're spinning this coordinated narrative that violence is acceptable if
[03:36:28.280 --> 03:36:33.840]  it's directed against Donald Trump because it's Donald Trump's fault then
[03:36:33.840 --> 03:36:38.040]  you have Twitter which of course bans conservatives for having the wrong
[03:36:38.040 --> 03:36:44.400]  politics still giving this guy a platform this guy who jumped up on stage to
[03:36:44.400 --> 03:36:48.360]  try and attack Trump they're not censoring him they're not deleting his
[03:36:48.360 --> 03:36:53.480]  account this again sends the message CNN giving him a platform sends the message
[03:36:53.480 --> 03:36:58.680]  to thousands of other potentially violent lunatics you too can become a
[03:36:58.680 --> 03:37:04.680]  media star by physically attacking Trump they're legitimizing this they're
[03:37:04.680 --> 03:37:11.240]  encouraging this they're inciting violence the media is inciting violence
[03:37:11.240 --> 03:37:16.560]  not Donald Trump then look what happened in Chicago as he heard in the video
[03:37:16.560 --> 03:37:20.920]  before you know imagine if Donald Trump supporters have crashed to Bernie Sanders
[03:37:20.920 --> 03:37:26.280]  rally imagine if they were caught on camera firing machine guns blocking
[03:37:26.280 --> 03:37:32.880]  ambulances assaulting people waving Nazi flags would the media describe them as
[03:37:32.880 --> 03:37:39.400]  peaceful protesters no yet that's all we've heard since Chicago so again this
[03:37:39.400 --> 03:37:45.120]  is the classic leftist social justice warrior tactic you stage the violence
[03:37:45.120 --> 03:37:50.440]  and then you claim that you're the victim and today the Washington Post came
[03:37:50.440 --> 03:37:54.680]  out and doubled down on this they basically lied and tried to claim that
[03:37:54.680 --> 03:38:01.120]  Trump had cooked up a giant conspiracy to sabotage his own event in Chicago you
[03:38:01.120 --> 03:38:06.320]  know like Trump controls the George Soros funded radicals who caused this mayhem
[03:38:06.320 --> 03:38:11.560]  so they were like how dare Donald Trump even plan to have an event in Chicago
[03:38:11.560 --> 03:38:16.400]  given the amount of people amount of you know leftists who support Bernie Sanders
[03:38:16.400 --> 03:38:21.480]  who support Hillary Clinton how dare he even go to Chicago how dare he violate
[03:38:21.480 --> 03:38:26.000]  their safe space like a Republican candidate is not even allowed to go
[03:38:26.000 --> 03:38:30.320]  there and of course it's his fault it's all his fault it's his fault that the
[03:38:30.320 --> 03:38:33.840]  ambulance has got blocked it's his fault that they're running around assaulting
[03:38:33.840 --> 03:38:38.680]  people firing guns in the air because again this is the narrative being pushed
[03:38:38.680 --> 03:38:44.960]  violence is justified because you don't have to take responsibility for it just
[03:38:44.960 --> 03:38:49.120]  as they didn't have to take responsibility in Ferguson in Baltimore just blame
[03:38:49.120 --> 03:38:56.440]  Donald Trump so every major politician you saw you saw Bernie Sanders you saw
[03:38:56.440 --> 03:39:02.760]  Hillary Clinton unifies simultaneously to promote this mantra that Trump's
[03:39:02.760 --> 03:39:08.240]  rhetoric is responsible for the violence when he's the target of the violence
[03:39:08.240 --> 03:39:12.520]  again and again yes he made silly comments about wanting to truck wanting
[03:39:12.520 --> 03:39:18.280]  to punch people in the face but he's not inciting the violence you compare that
[03:39:18.280 --> 03:39:24.320]  to the violence that's being incited on Twitter every single day that is
[03:39:24.320 --> 03:39:30.400]  inciting violence CNN won't talk about it Fox News won't talk about it because
[03:39:30.400 --> 03:39:34.400]  they're protecting this establishment narrative that Donald Trump is
[03:39:34.400 --> 03:39:40.040]  responsible for the violence now let's go to this clip which is a basically a
[03:39:40.040 --> 03:39:45.200]  bunch of GOP insiders this is really interesting sat round a table this is
[03:39:45.200 --> 03:39:50.840]  out of a PBS documentary I think that's about to air scheming on how they're
[03:39:50.840 --> 03:39:56.520]  going to stop Donald Trump listen to how desperate they sound listen to the
[03:39:56.520 --> 03:40:02.080]  message that they're conveying which is what we've said all along the media the
[03:40:02.080 --> 03:40:06.920]  political class cannot control Donald Trump whether you love him or love him
[03:40:06.920 --> 03:40:10.960]  and I don't agree with many of his policies but he's a maverick he's
[03:40:10.960 --> 03:40:17.000]  self-funded he's outside of their control he's unpredictable and this whole
[03:40:17.000 --> 03:40:21.480]  thing is bigger than Donald Trump if Donald Trump loses if Hillary gets in
[03:40:21.480 --> 03:40:26.360]  whatever happens this will merely continue to build because it's part of a
[03:40:26.360 --> 03:40:32.040]  political revolution that is a complete rejection of the establishment of the
[03:40:32.040 --> 03:40:37.480]  lobbyists of people being screwed over and not represented by the Washington
[03:40:37.480 --> 03:40:43.080]  elite now listen to the arrogance of these GOP insiders as they scheme in
[03:40:43.080 --> 03:40:48.960]  the desperation of how they're going to stop Trump let's go to that clip
[03:40:50.760 --> 03:40:54.760]  everybody around this table that I know we've been in every presidential
[03:40:54.760 --> 03:40:59.960]  campaign probably since 1980 and various degrees and in Trump's problem you he
[03:40:59.960 --> 03:41:04.160]  doesn't have a company you don't know what his compass is
[03:41:04.280 --> 03:41:08.440]  and how problematic is that for the future of the party I think before it's
[03:41:08.440 --> 03:41:11.480]  all over it's going to be hugely problematic I talked to people all
[03:41:11.480 --> 03:41:14.240]  the time because I'm sure of it around the table doesn't they say why don't you
[03:41:14.240 --> 03:41:18.760]  Republicans do something about this guy
[03:41:18.760 --> 03:41:23.640]  I'm sorry this is not the Soviet Union we can't call a meeting and decide Trump
[03:41:23.640 --> 03:41:26.560]  is out and we hate that
[03:41:26.560 --> 03:41:31.000]  benign dictatorship who's for it Trump is doing well for one reason he
[03:41:31.000 --> 03:41:35.120]  understands that the climate and the culture of America today better than
[03:41:35.120 --> 03:41:37.360]  anybody at this table
[03:41:37.360 --> 03:41:41.480]  how do you feel about that the Republican nominee may be someone that none of you know
[03:41:41.480 --> 03:41:46.440]  shell shot bewildered Republicans are hierarchical respectful of authority
[03:41:46.440 --> 03:41:51.840]  we fall in line and Trump has interrupted that cycle Donald Trump nobody
[03:41:51.840 --> 03:41:55.000]  thought of him as any kind of political leader until six months ago he's not
[03:41:55.000 --> 03:42:00.240]  articulate he's not poised he's not informed all he has going for him is a
[03:42:00.240 --> 03:42:09.440]  lot of votes why hasn't any of that hit home here we are here we are and I
[03:42:09.440 --> 03:42:13.040]  think everyone's kind of flying into this he's inevitable and they he can't be
[03:42:13.040 --> 03:42:16.520]  stopped I believe he can be stopped what are you doing or plan to do to stop
[03:42:16.520 --> 03:42:27.560]  him exactly what are you doing we were effective in Iowa and that was enough to
[03:42:27.560 --> 03:42:31.280]  knock him in the second none of us know who you are our principal Katie Packer
[03:42:31.280 --> 03:42:37.640]  Katie Packer what's your role in that fact pulling which is now public record
[03:42:37.640 --> 03:42:41.680]  which concerns you more that he'd lose the general if he were the nominee or
[03:42:41.680 --> 03:42:47.320]  how he do his president losing the election what we're facing is a choice
[03:42:47.320 --> 03:42:52.880]  between Hillary and so what you're saying is vote for the least of two evils do
[03:42:52.880 --> 03:42:55.840]  you know for sure Trump would be a better president than Hillary no but it's a
[03:42:55.840 --> 03:43:00.400]  risk that I'm willing to to take if we get off into splitting our party we
[03:43:00.400 --> 03:43:03.720]  can't put it back together Humpty Dumpty won't come back together that's
[03:43:03.720 --> 03:43:07.160]  that's the great dividing line and that question right there because you care
[03:43:07.160 --> 03:43:10.000]  more about it being president I'm scared of this president I think he's an
[03:43:10.000 --> 03:43:14.160]  authoritarian figure to deport 12 million people build a wall in the
[03:43:14.160 --> 03:43:18.160]  Mexican border and impose a religious test on people coming into this country
[03:43:18.160 --> 03:43:23.480]  this old by okay so that's showtime clip a bunch of GOP insiders sat round the
[03:43:23.480 --> 03:43:28.840]  table discussing how they're gonna stop Donald Trump again a couple of them get
[03:43:28.840 --> 03:43:32.840]  it that this is representative of a wider revolution that's outside of the
[03:43:32.840 --> 03:43:38.480]  Republican Party it's outside of Donald Trump but others lament the fact that
[03:43:38.480 --> 03:43:42.960]  this isn't the Soviet Union that they can't act as quote benign dictators and
[03:43:42.960 --> 03:43:48.080]  just throw him out of the race all together and how shifty did they look
[03:43:48.080 --> 03:43:52.080]  while they were asking each other out the little schemes they're gonna cook up
[03:43:52.080 --> 03:43:55.720]  to try and get rid of Donald Trump it's a very interesting clip you can see the
[03:43:55.720 --> 03:44:00.920]  full clip on YouTube but a more accurate summation of what's going on with
[03:44:00.920 --> 03:44:06.480]  Trump was voiced today by David Stockman former US Office of Management and
[03:44:06.480 --> 03:44:11.280]  Budget Director he was on Bloomberg to discuss Trump's role against the
[03:44:11.280 --> 03:44:15.680]  Washington and Wall Street establishment and why no president can save the US
[03:44:15.680 --> 03:44:20.200]  economy let's go to this Bloomberg clip this is David Stockman it's the week
[03:44:20.200 --> 03:44:25.720]  when Donald Trump sows it up or is John Kasich gonna be the fly in the
[03:44:25.720 --> 03:44:31.400]  ointment and win the Ohio race I think it looks pretty inevitable but I would
[03:44:31.400 --> 03:44:37.960]  say that Donald Trump is a flying wedge of repudiation to the whole phony
[03:44:37.960 --> 03:44:43.160]  Washington Wall Street narrative that everything is fixed and we're gonna go
[03:44:43.160 --> 03:44:49.000]  on and live happily ever after he is right the great on-wash masses of
[03:44:49.000 --> 03:44:53.920]  mainstream know the only thing that's happened is that we have another huge
[03:44:53.920 --> 03:44:58.760]  financial bubble that a few thousand traders and hedge funds have made a
[03:44:58.760 --> 03:45:04.280]  killing that a few million households who have the financial assets are better
[03:45:04.280 --> 03:45:10.360]  off and everyone else is no better off in fact worse than they were before the
[03:45:10.360 --> 03:45:15.320]  crisis so what he is articulated and I don't agree with half of what he says
[03:45:15.320 --> 03:45:21.260]  of his wall on the Mexican border and so forth but what he's articulating is the
[03:45:21.260 --> 03:45:27.640]  establishment scam is an on-truth it's a big lie and we're gonna face a day a
[03:45:27.640 --> 03:45:32.800]  reckoning here so that's David Stockman on Bloomberg he gets it that this is
[03:45:32.800 --> 03:45:36.320]  bigger than Trump it's bigger than the Republican Party some of the GOP
[03:45:36.320 --> 03:45:41.320]  establishment still don't get that and they're still desperate from allowing
[03:45:41.320 --> 03:45:44.360]  Donald Trump to get anywhere near the White House even if that involves
[03:45:44.360 --> 03:45:48.800]  supporting Hillary Clinton so now we've seen this huge media narrative this is
[03:45:48.800 --> 03:45:54.880]  the latest big gambit to sink Donald Trump's credibility to blame him for
[03:45:54.880 --> 03:46:01.200]  this violence and in fact to encourage more violence this is the escalation
[03:46:01.200 --> 03:46:07.240]  that they hope to trigger they want to incite more violence by blaming Donald
[03:46:07.240 --> 03:46:10.680]  Trump for inciting violence therefore giving people who want to commit
[03:46:10.680 --> 03:46:14.580]  violence and there are plenty of mentally deranged people out there
[03:46:14.580 --> 03:46:20.600]  perfectly willing to do that giving them the legitimacy to go ahead and do it
[03:46:20.600 --> 03:46:25.200]  that's what's happening in the aftermath of this domestic extremist who tried to
[03:46:25.200 --> 03:46:30.400]  rush the stage on Saturday night but this climate of violence and intimidation
[03:46:30.400 --> 03:46:35.840]  now sweeping America has nothing to do with Donald Trump it has everything to
[03:46:35.840 --> 03:46:40.940]  do with the president who said that what happened in Ferguson was an understandable
[03:46:40.940 --> 03:46:47.480]  form of protest okay Michael Brown a thug who charged it and tried to grab a
[03:46:47.480 --> 03:46:54.920]  cops gun that was their big icon for this big protest in Ferguson but Obama
[03:46:54.920 --> 03:46:59.240]  said that that was legitimate that was understandable to protest that incident
[03:46:59.240 --> 03:47:04.440]  and of course they protested it by burning and looting the entire city by
[03:47:04.440 --> 03:47:09.240]  raising black-owned businesses to the ground then you had the likes of Time
[03:47:09.240 --> 03:47:13.920]  magazine who were also to blame for this climate of violence now sweeping
[03:47:13.920 --> 03:47:19.320]  America for asserting that violent rioting is a legitimate form of protest
[03:47:19.320 --> 03:47:25.120]  remember the headline in defense of rioting Time magazine and of course
[03:47:25.120 --> 03:47:30.600]  that was a message acted upon by the thugs who ransacked Baltimore just five
[03:47:30.600 --> 03:47:35.520]  or six months later so I blame the media this is not Donald Trump's fault this
[03:47:35.520 --> 03:47:40.520]  goes way back before Donald Trump even came on to the scene in the presidential
[03:47:40.520 --> 03:47:46.960]  race you had the media parroting the hands up don't shoot hoax that fueled
[03:47:46.960 --> 03:47:52.440]  the Ferguson arrest never happened no evidence it ever happened yet for
[03:47:52.440 --> 03:47:58.120]  months and months the media parroted that lie to stoke up this resentment this
[03:47:58.120 --> 03:48:03.160]  racial division in America and then I blame Hillary Clinton I blame the New
[03:48:03.160 --> 03:48:08.160]  York Times and the political class for anointing black lives matter as a
[03:48:08.160 --> 03:48:13.000]  respectable political movement that doesn't mean that certain people within
[03:48:13.000 --> 03:48:16.880]  black lives matter or people that support some of its aims you know aren't
[03:48:16.880 --> 03:48:21.880]  decent respectable people but the leadership the founders you look at the
[03:48:21.880 --> 03:48:27.320]  three founders of black lives matter their ideological inspiration and this
[03:48:27.320 --> 03:48:30.800]  is the woman whose name they channed over and over again at black lives matter
[03:48:30.800 --> 03:48:37.240]  rallies a sartre Shakur she's a convicted cop killer who is on the FBI's most
[03:48:37.240 --> 03:48:43.720]  wanted terrorist list that's the icon for black lives matter imagine if the
[03:48:43.720 --> 03:48:49.480]  Oregon militia group announced that their icon was Timothy McVeigh the Oklahoma
[03:48:49.480 --> 03:48:54.120]  City bomber and then they got a glowing profile in the New York Times not gonna
[03:48:54.120 --> 03:48:58.960]  happen so why does it happen with black lives matter well it's because the
[03:48:58.960 --> 03:49:05.040]  media is to blame for inciting this racial division in America they want to
[03:49:05.040 --> 03:49:08.760]  keep people divided because they don't want people to come together and realize
[03:49:08.760 --> 03:49:12.880]  that we've got problems outside of race the problem is this political
[03:49:12.880 --> 03:49:17.280]  establishment and that's why Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump are getting all
[03:49:17.280 --> 03:49:22.840]  these supporters so Donald Trump isn't to blame for that so we've got this
[03:49:22.840 --> 03:49:26.120]  environment that's now being created in fact there's an article out of Breitbart
[03:49:26.120 --> 03:49:32.840]  why receive Raheem Kazan he points out that the media's role now is to send out
[03:49:32.840 --> 03:49:38.840]  a green light to every lunatic that it's legitimate to try and attack Trump this
[03:49:38.840 --> 03:49:43.440]  is part of the dirty tricks campaign that they've now launched because they're
[03:49:43.440 --> 03:49:47.520]  gonna force you know the security at Trump rallies to be more oppressive
[03:49:47.520 --> 03:49:52.320]  they're gonna force Trump to stand further away from his audience you saw
[03:49:52.320 --> 03:49:55.800]  the video just yesterday I think it might have played earlier it's up on
[03:49:55.800 --> 03:50:01.000]  info wars.com where this guy who legally emigrated to the United States wants to
[03:50:01.000 --> 03:50:06.080]  get up on stage obviously a big PR boon for Donald Trump but Trump's hesitant to
[03:50:06.080 --> 03:50:09.720]  even allow him to get up on stage in the first place given what happened on
[03:50:09.720 --> 03:50:14.480]  Saturday so you're gonna see more of that Trump's gonna be more isolated from
[03:50:14.480 --> 03:50:19.320]  the crowd so it's going to tamp down on you know that kind of energy that's
[03:50:19.320 --> 03:50:23.880]  driven him forward so much because of these concerns that violent lunatics
[03:50:23.880 --> 03:50:29.680]  could infiltrate these rallies and try to attack Trump because that's what the
[03:50:29.680 --> 03:50:35.000]  media is encouraging by venerating violence by holding up this guy who
[03:50:35.000 --> 03:50:40.240]  tried to jump Trump on Saturday CNN and giving him a platform giving him
[03:50:40.240 --> 03:50:46.520]  legitimacy and credibility therefore encouraging other people to do the same

[03:54:10.000 --> 03:54:14.080]  Paul Joseph Watson now everything I've talked about over the last hour will be
[03:54:14.080 --> 03:54:18.120]  summarized in a video that's going up in a few hours called the assassination of
[03:54:18.120 --> 03:54:22.440]  Donald Trump that's what the media the political class is now encouraging they
[03:54:22.440 --> 03:54:26.280]  can't assassinate his character they failed miserably so now they're
[03:54:26.280 --> 03:54:32.440]  actually encouraging his physical assassination by inciting violence by
[03:54:32.440 --> 03:54:37.000]  legitimizing people who attack him and now we've got a story out of our tea
[03:54:37.000 --> 03:54:41.640]  which is related to that Trump militia Twitter group vows to protect Donald's
[03:54:41.640 --> 03:54:46.480]  supporters following clashes and stage attack so basically you had a bunch of
[03:54:46.480 --> 03:54:50.640]  people come together and say they're gonna act as a kind of vigilante group
[03:54:50.640 --> 03:54:55.840]  to try and protect Trump from these extremists and what happened well
[03:54:55.840 --> 03:55:00.200]  within hours of them setting up this Twitter account they got 500 followers
[03:55:00.200 --> 03:55:06.640]  or so an anti-trump extremist direct message the creator of this Twitter
[03:55:06.640 --> 03:55:13.320]  account a photo of his child school accompanied with a message I'm coming for
[03:55:13.320 --> 03:55:18.880]  him so they had to close the Twitter account because the anti-trump extremists
[03:55:18.880 --> 03:55:24.720]  were threatening to kill this guy's kids but Donald Trump's responsible for
[03:55:24.720 --> 03:55:29.680]  inciting violence they're just peaceful protesters the ones making death threats
[03:55:29.680 --> 03:55:37.000]  to kill somebody's kids just peaceful protesters the telegraph is reporting the
[03:55:37.000 --> 03:55:42.760]  KKK leader who says he backs Hillary Clinton if Donald Trump is ambivalent
[03:55:42.760 --> 03:55:47.240]  about the KKK and other fringe groups he's been linked with he can rest assured
[03:55:47.240 --> 03:55:51.400]  that for some at least the feeling is mutual the demagogic Republican front
[03:55:51.400 --> 03:55:54.720]  runners come under fire for failing to adequately disavow the support of David
[03:55:54.720 --> 03:56:01.760]  Duke well now William Gwig is campaigning for Hillary Clinton he's a KKK
[03:56:01.760 --> 03:56:08.280]  member when will Hillary Clinton disavow this KKK supporter and even if she
[03:56:08.280 --> 03:56:15.320]  does let's ask her to disavow this KKK supporter about 200 more times even though
[03:56:15.320 --> 03:56:20.000]  she's already disavowed him that's what they did with Donald Trump for about two
[03:56:20.000 --> 03:56:26.800]  weeks and they still say he hasn't disavowed David Duke we've got Gateway
[03:56:26.800 --> 03:56:33.360]  pundit reporting video unearthed pasta calls for execution of gays then
[03:56:33.360 --> 03:56:39.120]  introduces Ted Cruz at conference so this completely demented pasta is
[03:56:39.120 --> 03:56:46.000]  leaping around on stage ranting about how Leviticus authorizes mandates the
[03:56:46.000 --> 03:56:51.280]  execution of gay people then minutes later he introduces Donald Trump so
[03:56:51.280 --> 03:56:57.400]  you've got this pro-cruise pasta introducing introducing Cruz I'm sorry
[03:56:57.400 --> 03:57:01.040]  talking about wanting to kill gay people saying they should be executed
[03:57:01.040 --> 03:57:07.560]  before he endorses and introduces Ted Cruz so he's spouting ISIS like hate
[03:57:07.560 --> 03:57:13.840]  rhetoric wanting to kill gay people he supports Ted Cruz but Donald Trump is
[03:57:13.840 --> 03:57:17.840]  the bigger and hate gay people and he's inciting violence we have Breitbart
[03:57:17.840 --> 03:57:23.720]  reporting pictures migrants place babies on train tracks demand racist Europe
[03:57:23.720 --> 03:57:28.040]  open its borders migrants have placed their babies toddlers and young European
[03:57:28.040 --> 03:57:31.480]  young children on railway tracks in Greece in a bid to blackmail European
[03:57:31.480 --> 03:57:35.960]  authorities into reopening their borders so he had the signs of the
[03:57:35.960 --> 03:57:40.400]  Macedonian border open the border or die that didn't work now they're actually
[03:57:40.400 --> 03:57:45.840]  using their children as human shields putting them on train tracks to try and
[03:57:45.840 --> 03:57:51.880]  elicit sympathy we've seen that before we've seen migrants being paid to pose
[03:57:51.880 --> 03:57:56.000]  as people drowning in the sea when you can see that they're on the shore stood
[03:57:56.000 --> 03:58:00.520]  up again brazen propaganda and that's why in Germany
[03:58:00.520 --> 03:58:06.760]  anti-immigrant AFD makes huge gains in votes exit polls preliminary results in
[03:58:06.760 --> 03:58:10.360]  the German regional elections show significant success for the right

[03:58:15.600 --> 03:58:19.400]  been represented they've been censored on Facebook they've got police visits
[03:58:19.400 --> 03:58:24.000]  happening simply for criticizing the migrant crisis and now you see the
