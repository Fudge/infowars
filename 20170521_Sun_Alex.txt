[00:00.000 --> 00:14.000]  Waging War on Corruption, it's Alex Jones
[00:14.000 --> 00:32.000]  At the time of the season, when love runs high, in this time, give it to me easy, and let me try with pleasure in hands
[00:32.000 --> 00:43.000]  To take you in the sun to promise love, to show you everyone is the time of the season
[00:43.000 --> 00:49.000]  The decisions we make will affect countless lives
[00:49.000 --> 01:05.000]  King Solomon, I thank you for the creation of this great moment in history, and for your massive investments in America and its industries and its jobs
[01:05.000 --> 01:23.000]  I also thank you for investing in the future of this part of the world. The fertile region, and it is so fertile, has all of the ingredients for extraordinary success
[01:23.000 --> 01:42.000]  A rich history and culture, a young and vibrant people, a thriving spirit of enterprise, but you can only unlock this future if the citizens of the Middle East are freed from extremism, terror and violence
[01:42.000 --> 02:03.000]  We in this room are the leaders of our peoples. They look to us for answers and for action, and when we look back at their faces, behind every pair of eyes is a soul that yearns for justice and yearns for peace
[02:03.000 --> 02:14.000]  Today, billions of faces are now looking at us, waiting for us to act on the great question of our time
[02:14.000 --> 02:40.000]  Will we be indifferent in the presence of evil? Will we protect our citizens from its violent ideology? Will we let its venom spread through our societies? Will we let it destroy the most holy sites on earth?
[02:40.000 --> 02:46.000]  If we do not confront this deadly terror, we know what the future will bring
[03:11.000 --> 03:21.000]  I think that remains to be seen, but I'll say this, there's a whole controversy brewing out there, and as they say, optics are pretty much everything
[03:21.000 --> 03:31.000]  President Trump criticized President Obama, as I did, for bowing from the waist all the way down in front of Saudi royalty, truly disgusting
[03:31.000 --> 03:40.000]  You don't see British Prime Ministers and other people doing that, or even French leaders. It's one thing of its custom, the Japanese, to bow slightly to each other in respect
[03:40.000 --> 03:45.000]  Now, this is bowing to a royal saying, you're subservient
[03:45.000 --> 04:04.000]  Now, a lot of conservative media says Trump didn't bow, well the truth is he curtsied, he didn't really bow from the waist, he lowered his legs, technically, so that they could put the medal that they give presidents, they've given W. Bush and they've given Obama the same medal
[04:04.000 --> 04:20.000]  It's all optics, and so he didn't bow as far down, but if you say you're not going to play golf, like Obama, and then you do, or you say you're not going to bow then you curtsied, optically, it's breaking the promise
[04:20.000 --> 04:29.000]  I'm going to open the phones up, not just on this issue, on a whole host of them, a little bit later in the hour, and we're going to have a free-for-all discussion about this
[04:29.000 --> 04:38.000]  Roger Stone tweeted out that it made him sick at his stomach, seeing Trump hand-in-hand with the Saudis and all the rest of it
[04:38.000 --> 04:53.000]  My big question is, are we not seeing engagement? Is he not criticizing radical Islam to their faces, something other U.S. presidents won't do? Is he not bombing the forces they've backed and driving them out of Syria and then showing up with an olive branch?
[04:53.000 --> 04:58.000]  We'll see, but it looks like a master stroke to me, a lot more coming up
[04:58.000 --> 05:06.000]  Electrify your day with Secret 12. It's like lightning in a bottle. We all have days in which we just can't seem to perform at the level we'd like to

[05:14.000 --> 05:19.000]  Proper vitamin and nutrient intake is essential to keep your body functioning at optimum levels
[05:19.000 --> 05:25.000]  The reality is, it's hard to take in the proper amount of vitamins we need each day with our modern diets
[05:25.000 --> 05:33.000]  Secret 12 by InfoWars Live is an easy way to naturally upgrade your vitamin B12 intake and support your body's natural systems
[05:33.000 --> 05:38.000]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula

[05:44.000 --> 05:47.000]  But it also assists with many other functions of the body
[05:47.000 --> 05:50.000]  Electrify your mind and body and take your health to the next level

[06:21.000 --> 06:26.000]  They openly admit they're doing it. Will they get away with it? Will you put up with it?
[06:26.000 --> 06:32.000]  And breaking live, will Donald Trump resign? It's come out in government documents and from sources
[06:32.000 --> 06:35.000]  But the Democrats do plan to get the president to resign
[06:35.000 --> 06:39.000]  Paul Watson wrote about that for InfoWars.com on Friday
[06:39.000 --> 06:42.000]  We'll be going over those leaked memos and documents
[06:42.000 --> 07:01.000]  But they say even if they can't get Trump to resign, they plan to sabotage his administration where he's completely scared to engage in any type of political interface or discourse with the Russians or anyone else because he'll be called a treacherous agent against America
[07:01.000 --> 07:11.000]  It's truly the gutting and the gilding of the presidency by the special interest and by the bureaucracy if they're successful
[07:11.000 --> 07:21.000]  Both Korea's fired off another unspecified missile into the sea off Japan as South Korea condemns it as irresponsible and reckless behavior escalating that
[07:21.000 --> 07:26.000]  Come he's set to be testifying in Congress next week and we keep asking the question
[07:26.000 --> 07:37.000]  He said on May 3rd two weeks ago in front of the Judiciary Committee in the Senate that no one had tried to influence him
[07:37.000 --> 07:49.000]  No one and then a few weeks later we learned there's a memo from two months before saying that he had tried to influence him
[07:49.000 --> 07:58.000]  And then the Daily Beast comes out and says Alex Jones caught in fake news again
[07:58.000 --> 08:08.000]  Alex Jones caused the stock market to go up you cannot make this up they called the head of the stock market and they said yes it's Alex Jones
[08:08.000 --> 08:11.000]  It's horrible
[08:11.000 --> 08:17.000]  He played this clip of Comey saying that no one had tried to influence him
[08:17.000 --> 08:29.000]  But the Daily Beast goes but it's it's it's it's two weeks old so it doesn't matter Jones act like it was new no we didn't we said in the article with the video this is from the Senate Judiciary Committee
[08:29.000 --> 08:38.000]  Two weeks ago where he says no one's tried to influence him and then he knew of no one no one two months after
[08:38.000 --> 08:49.000]  So see they're talking about a memo that's two months old two and a half months old and saying it's the most powerful thing on earth just oh Trump is such a criminal he's such an obstructor of justice it's all over
[08:49.000 --> 08:59.000]  And then they play this game going but Jones put out a two week old thing that like it was new and and you need to fake because because it didn't mean anything
[08:59.000 --> 09:08.000]  No one had pointed out that he'd said months after this memo was written in the Judiciary Committee that no one had tried to influence him
[09:08.000 --> 09:14.000]  That's as pertinent as it was two weeks ago or two months ago or a hundred years ago it doesn't matter it's the same thing
[09:14.000 --> 09:25.000]  Comey says he has a memo where Trump was trying to obstruct justice or at least approaching it and then he's in a testimony months later saying no one ever tried to influence him
[09:25.000 --> 09:36.000]  And that is totally and completely pertinent and for a day and a half I saw absolutely no coverage of this I couldn't believe it
[09:36.000 --> 09:41.000]  Tit Daniels article breaking Comey caught committing perjury to Congress
[09:41.000 --> 09:48.000]  Comey's May 3rd Senate testimony contradicts reported February memo that makes total sense doesn't it
[09:48.000 --> 09:57.000]  And a week later on May 3rd he contradicts in live testimony what a supposed memo says that is pure 101 two plus two equals journalism
[09:57.000 --> 10:09.000]  So I'm going to hit this first because it feeds into so many angles how the mainstream media is deceptive how they think you're so stupid how they're debunking articles are so deceptive
[10:09.000 --> 10:17.000]  They're in the news simultaneously trying to drive down markets saying those of you that supported Trump his annex for the reason the stock market is down
[10:17.000 --> 10:24.000]  No it was up three trillion plus dollars because of exuberance and the talk of tax cuts and the belief that America was back to be in business
[10:24.000 --> 10:31.000]  The globalists are the ones trying to bring Trump down that are killing the exuberance killing the confidence and driving the market down
[10:31.000 --> 10:37.000]  But if you read the news Trump is causing the stock market to go down in fact that was the headline from CNN a few days ago
[10:37.000 --> 10:42.000]  It was pretty much put out by hundreds of publications I saw it everywhere
[10:42.000 --> 10:46.000]  Will people finally abandon Trump because the market's going down
[10:46.000 --> 10:52.000]  Will Trump causing the market to go down finally get people to get wise to him
[10:52.000 --> 10:58.000]  It's like if you have a boat keeping you from drowning out in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean and somebody blows a hole in the bottom
[10:58.000 --> 11:04.000]  And they say ah look your boat's flooding your boat's bad no you're bad for blowing the hole in the bottom of it
[11:04.000 --> 11:08.000]  But this is the type of crazy deception so here's a few of the articles
[11:08.000 --> 11:15.000]  Will Trump cheer for Yellen if Fed raises rates and it goes on to say they're planning to raise rates to try to stop the Trump agenda
[11:15.000 --> 11:19.000]  Because if you can hurt the market well that'll hurt Trump right
[11:19.000 --> 11:25.000]  We've got all these different Brit leaders pointing out how the EU is saying we're going to use economic warfare to destroy the UK
[11:25.000 --> 11:28.000]  To keep them inside the unelected EU
[11:28.000 --> 11:41.000]  Again this is economic warfare and so now it's the same thing as the unelected EU tries to force England back into the Euro
[11:41.000 --> 11:47.000]  And the reason I raise that is it ties into this latest article that's out today
[11:47.000 --> 11:50.000]  Where they're involved in economic terrorism against this country
[11:50.000 --> 11:54.000]  The globalists the very same multinational banks they're trying to kill the markets
[11:54.000 --> 12:01.000]  They're trying to kill investment they're trying to kill initiatives to get small business loans up by the Federal Reserve through local banks
[12:01.000 --> 12:07.000]  They're cheering how the markets are down because Trump's in trouble and then blaming him
[12:07.000 --> 12:14.000]  When it was exuberance and belief in America and Trump that got the market up say what you want that's a fact
[12:14.000 --> 12:20.000]  But that's how these losers grab victory from the jaws of defeat
[12:20.000 --> 12:26.000]  They don't give up they say the elections fake the exuberance is fake
[12:26.000 --> 12:31.000]  Info wars is fake on and on and on
[12:31.000 --> 12:35.000]  It's incredible I've come to the realization that most newspapers do retractions every day
[12:35.000 --> 12:40.000]  I've done three in 22 years and they use the few retractions we've done as if we admit we're fake news
[12:40.000 --> 12:47.000]  Because they're the fake news that's what these diabolical people do is they prey on you like you're stupid
[12:47.000 --> 12:49.000]  Look at these headlines
[12:49.000 --> 12:57.000]  How a White House walloped by scandal may change the odds for Wall Street and your retirement
[12:57.000 --> 13:02.000]  News out of Washington seem to have a direct impact on Wall Street this way
[13:02.000 --> 13:11.000]  On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average fell 373 points the biggest single drop of the year and the worst day since September
[13:11.000 --> 13:15.000]  All the NASDAQ had its biggest drop since June
[13:15.000 --> 13:25.000]  The steep drop occurred the day after the FBI director Robert Mueller, former director was appointed special counsel to investigate possible connections between Trump's campaign and Rothschilder in the 2016 election
[13:25.000 --> 13:33.000]  With some investors getting nervous it raises the question whether Wall Street is in for more volatility if more turmoil engulfs the White House
[13:33.000 --> 13:41.000]  So they're pushing this whole agenda and pushing the market down and trying to spook the market everywhere
[13:41.000 --> 13:48.000]  They were always cheerleading for Obama saying the market is going to stay up forever but as soon as Trump got in oh storm clouds is going to go down
[13:48.000 --> 14:00.000]  Now enter the Daily Beast, true bird cage liner, true failed yellow journalism, corporate prostitute disinfo, fake news, politics along
[14:00.000 --> 14:09.000]  The folks that tell you Hillary was going to win by 15 points, the people that helped share all their intel with Hillary and CNN and all the fake information
[14:09.000 --> 14:15.000]  Just remember all the things they've been caught lying about that they hope you forget about while they point at real media and call fake news
[14:15.000 --> 14:24.000]  Stock surge as trading floors watched breaking info wars video it was two weeks old and wrong
[14:24.000 --> 14:29.000]  You read the article carefully none of that is true except for it being two weeks old
[14:29.000 --> 14:35.000]  But it was new because no one had pointed out that Comey said no one's tried to influence the investigation
[14:35.000 --> 14:41.000]  That was back at the time they were saying Trump was in the news that's pretty important nobody covered that you'd think that was big
[14:41.000 --> 14:48.000]  And it was important two weeks old because the memo had just reportedly come out they didn't really release it
[14:48.000 --> 14:52.000]  They just said oh we have a memo it's magical but I have to show it to you
[14:52.000 --> 15:00.000]  That was driving down markets because the memo said the president reportedly tried to influence the FBI director then at the time James Comey
[15:00.000 --> 15:06.000]  So of course something from two weeks ago is pertinent when two weeks later they've got this supposed memo
[15:06.000 --> 15:11.000]  And we've got the director two weeks before saying that no one tried to influence it
[15:11.000 --> 15:19.000]  But they just spin it and say oh it's two weeks old so it's deceptive and then they admit though that it raised the stock market
[15:19.000 --> 15:26.000]  Up out of negative territory for a few hours but don't worry the Daily Beast and others called and everybody let them know it's fake
[15:26.000 --> 15:30.000]  So we got it down again
[15:30.000 --> 15:33.000]  A lot of people say I don't only stock I don't care I don't know any stock either
[15:33.000 --> 15:42.000]  But thousands of companies use the stock to hire and to build and for portfolios and for profit and that's what keeps our economy going
[15:42.000 --> 15:45.000]  Is America's vibrant stock market
[15:45.000 --> 15:53.000]  While it was on the Gresham side of the family back in England almost close to 500 years ago that my ancestor invented the stock exchange
[15:53.000 --> 15:57.000]  They kind of invented the modern world didn't it? We'll be right back stay with us

[19:37.000 --> 19:41.000]  The Alexa pure breeze will be a steal at three hundred four hundred five hundred dollars

[20:22.000 --> 20:30.000]  Alright I got tons of other key news coming up in the next segment but I've got to cover this because it deals with how the fake mainstream corporate media deceives
[20:30.000 --> 20:40.000]  And it openly shows how they're cheerleading to drive down the stock market to kill nationalism free market non-crony capitalism
[20:40.000 --> 20:45.000]  The whole Trump style movement worldwide not just here in the United States
[20:45.000 --> 20:51.000]  You can read hundreds of major headlines globalism in crisis world government in crisis new order in crisis
[20:51.000 --> 20:56.000]  We've got to stop the nationalists why they want to get local control back in their countries
[20:56.000 --> 21:06.000]  That's how crazy this has gotten and then I sit here and I read hit pieces against yours truly that come out every few minutes
[21:06.000 --> 21:11.000]  In major publications I mean sometimes hundreds and hundreds of times a day
[21:11.000 --> 21:23.000]  In fact most days it's hundreds of times a day and then they attack me and actually give credit where credit's due that yeah it is big news
[21:23.000 --> 21:40.000]  It is giant giant giant news that Comey came out on May 3rd and said no one in the administration has tried to get me to change my testimony
[21:40.000 --> 21:45.000]  I can't influence anybody in fact can we cue that clip up thanks forgot to tell the crew
[21:45.000 --> 21:52.000]  And then we point out wow this is big no one has talked about this no one has covered this that we know of
[21:52.000 --> 21:59.000]  We posted the clip we posted the full testimony it's completely clear what they're talking about
[21:59.000 --> 22:05.000]  And then no one covers it for a day and a half until the Daily Beast puts an article out and goes
[22:05.000 --> 22:13.000]  We called notified the stock market this was fake and told them they might want to you know reconsider and because it's fake news
[22:13.000 --> 22:20.000]  You know the clips old yes and the memos old too months after I'm going to explain this to the Daily Beast very very slowly
[22:20.000 --> 22:24.000]  Because maybe they're just not elitist liars maybe they're real dumb
[22:24.000 --> 22:31.000]  If Comey did a memo from the middle of February after he met with the president
[22:31.000 --> 22:39.000]  And he didn't give that memo to the Justice Department if he believed it was obstruction then he is guilty of obstruction of justice
[22:39.000 --> 22:45.000]  Even the former Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez has gone public on that point
[22:45.000 --> 22:54.000]  But then it gets more important it gets more obvious if he's saying back in February and I know most of the audience gets this
[22:54.000 --> 23:04.000]  This is for liberals show intellectuals the Daily Beast someone talk very slowly and I don't mean this mean
[23:04.000 --> 23:16.000]  But it's not old if it contradicts an older statement the memos not old is it no because it just got broken
[23:16.000 --> 23:22.000]  And then there's a later video where the FBI director contradicts himself under oath
[23:22.000 --> 23:33.000]  So May 3rd 2017 is later than was it like February 9th meeting with the White House with Comey and Trump
[23:33.000 --> 23:40.000]  February is earlier than May in 2017 that's not a conspiracy theory
[23:40.000 --> 23:47.000]  And I'm not being sarcastic because I'm going to read this Daily Beast article not because they're that important
[23:47.000 --> 23:52.000]  But because it shows the type of people that read this and believe this
[23:52.000 --> 23:55.000]  Okay
[23:55.000 --> 24:05.000]  Because again Comey saying months after he does the memo that no one ever tried to influence him shows he's either perjuring himself
[24:05.000 --> 24:10.000]  Or the memos a lie either way he's perjured himself
[24:10.000 --> 24:15.000]  So let's go ahead now and play Comey here it is
[24:15.000 --> 24:21.000]  So if the attorney general or senior officials at the Department of Justice opposes a specific investigation
[24:21.000 --> 24:25.000]  Can they halt that FBI investigation?
[24:25.000 --> 24:28.000]  In theory yes
[24:28.000 --> 24:30.000]  Has it happened?
[24:30.000 --> 24:37.000]  Not in my experience because it would be a big deal to tell the FBI to stop doing something that without appropriate purpose
[24:37.000 --> 24:43.000]  I mean we're oftentimes they give us opinions that we don't see a case there and so you ought to stop investing resources in it
[24:43.000 --> 24:49.000]  But I'm talking about a situation where we were told to stop something for a political reason that would be a very big deal
[24:49.000 --> 24:52.000]  It's not happened in my experience
[24:52.000 --> 24:57.000]  Now what's crazier is they didn't say in the Daily Beast article I'm going to read this to you
[24:57.000 --> 25:04.000]  This isn't about info wars it's about you the country the stock market the future people that want to plunge that stock market
[25:04.000 --> 25:07.000]  And think you're so stupid you don't see what they're doing
[25:07.000 --> 25:12.000]  And I'm going to say it again of listeners that don't have stocks I don't either
[25:12.000 --> 25:17.000]  But it's what funds this country it's what creates the engine of free market
[25:17.000 --> 25:21.000]  And the big mega banks the big Goldman Sachs they're always going to get free Federal Reserve money
[25:21.000 --> 25:26.000]  But they don't want the smaller companies getting successful stock offerings that's a fact
[25:26.000 --> 25:31.000]  The banking associations the stock market associations they've all written books on it it's well known
[25:31.000 --> 25:37.000]  And Trump's trying to get the lending back to local government and back to local businesses
[25:37.000 --> 25:44.000]  And he's trying to get the Federal Reserve to do that and he's trying to open the stock market up for the little guys again
[25:44.000 --> 25:48.000]  And not just let the big guys sit there and dominate it and control it
[25:48.000 --> 25:52.000]  So this is a war of consolidation
[25:52.000 --> 25:59.000]  And what's even crazier is they say in the Daily Beast that I also edited the clip
[25:59.000 --> 26:08.000]  So you didn't hear the congresswoman or the senator say to Comey
[26:08.000 --> 26:12.000]  Oh did the attorney general or did the deputy attorney general anybody try to stop you
[26:12.000 --> 26:16.000]  They say we took it out of context and said it was about a question about Trump
[26:16.000 --> 26:21.000]  We just played the exact clip that we played then and it's in Kid Daniels article
[26:21.000 --> 26:26.000]  You people are incredible liars you are the fake newsmasters
[26:26.000 --> 26:30.000]  If I tried to lie I couldn't lie so intensely as this
[26:30.000 --> 26:33.000]  I mean this is crazy
[26:33.000 --> 26:37.000]  And that's why I realize now as a news organization everyone's home we make mistakes
[26:37.000 --> 26:40.000]  If somebody calls us up we do a retraction we can't even do retraction
[26:40.000 --> 26:43.000]  We just have to go to lawsuits you name it and never back down
[26:43.000 --> 26:47.000]  Because they just want to run the headline that we're fake news everywhere
[26:47.000 --> 26:53.000]  When we're the real news over and over and over again you hear on this show
[26:53.000 --> 26:59.000]  Information that doesn't come out for decades many times or years or months or weeks
[26:59.000 --> 27:07.000]  And that's why they hate us because the fake news can't exist while there's real news operating or it discredits them
[27:07.000 --> 27:17.000]  But just imagine the preface of this that I'm bad because we had the good news that Comey had said earlier
[27:17.000 --> 27:19.000]  That nobody tried to influence him
[27:19.000 --> 27:24.000]  But that earlier statement came after the memo was written that's a big deal that discredits the memo
[27:24.000 --> 27:34.000]  Which nobody can see but still just some mist in the air or less than mist
[27:34.000 --> 27:41.000]  And then I'm going to read the whole article when we come back because people need to understand the methodology of deception
[27:41.000 --> 27:47.000]  Because I'm not liberal I'm not conservative I'm just Americana I just want freedom I want prosperity I want transparency
[27:47.000 --> 27:52.000]  Then I'll get into Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia is it genius or is it a sellout
[27:52.000 --> 27:56.000]  Time will tell but I'll break it down we'll place over speech
[27:56.000 --> 28:03.000]  We're going to get to a very powerful Paul Watson report that deals with the globalists trying to foment massive riots this summer
[28:03.000 --> 28:06.000]  To coincide with trying to get the president to resign
[28:06.000 --> 28:11.000]  And Paul did an article on Friday showing government documents and sources that indeed that is what they want
[28:11.000 --> 28:16.000]  They want to make him resign or crippling so bad he can't get an agenda through and plunge the economy
[28:16.000 --> 28:23.000]  But imagine stock surge is trading floors watched breaking info wars video
[28:23.000 --> 28:29.000]  It was two weeks old and wrong the only true thing there is it was two weeks old and no one had pointed it out
[28:29.000 --> 28:33.000]  It's kind of like you find out your neighbor killed somebody two weeks later and they dig the body up the backyard
[28:33.000 --> 28:36.000]  The cops say oh it's two weeks old doesn't matter no
[28:36.000 --> 28:42.000]  Again I'm explained very slowly two months before there's supposedly a memo saying Trump did try to influence him
[28:42.000 --> 28:47.000]  So if he's testifying months later that no one did try to testify
[28:47.000 --> 28:52.000]  You know best of the testimony then that's pretty important right it's bombshell it's huge
[28:52.000 --> 28:57.000]  That's why they wrote this fake story to deceive everybody God forbid the stock market go up
[28:57.000 --> 29:03.000]  Trump put out a statement saying what you are seeing is sabotage
[29:03.000 --> 29:14.000]  The fake news media is working hand in hand with Washington's corrupt bureaucracy to try to slow and block out our America first agenda
[29:14.000 --> 29:22.000]  With so many forces out to ruin us we are turning to you and our most trusted supporters at this critical moment
[29:22.000 --> 29:32.000]  On Trump's website he has set up a drain the swamp campaign asking for contributions to help in the swamp draining process
[29:32.000 --> 29:39.000]  He says we have no choice but to completely drain the swamp I have already started cleaning house
[29:39.000 --> 29:48.000]  But every day from here on out will be an uphill battle and we need to be prepared to go into the trenches to fight back
[29:48.000 --> 30:03.000]  For more reports go to infowars.com I'm Millie Weaver reporting

[30:21.000 --> 30:27.000]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created called ultra high molecular weight polyethylene
[30:27.000 --> 30:30.000]  Defender armor is also super compact and lightweight
[30:30.000 --> 30:36.000]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor
[30:36.000 --> 30:37.000]  It works
[30:37.000 --> 30:46.000]  Defender body armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level ballistic resistance certification from an authorized NIJ ballistic laboratory

[32:55.000 --> 32:58.000]  And support the info war while you support healthy gums and teeth
[32:58.000 --> 33:03.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[33:28.000 --> 33:44.000]  So I'm looking at a CNBC headline right here where they basically admit that because of the Trump scandals
[33:44.000 --> 33:49.000]  And the ongoing made up Russian probe that the stock market just plunged 373 points
[33:49.000 --> 33:54.000]  And that many Democrats and others hope to plunge the stock market
[33:54.000 --> 34:02.000]  So that they can get further political control and discredit nationalism and other nationalistic leaders and free market systems
[34:02.000 --> 34:09.000]  And they've had the daily beast come out and say that oh my gosh we talked to the heads of the stock market last week
[34:09.000 --> 34:17.000]  The stock market went back up for a few hours from its fall because they read an info war story and saw a two week old video of FBI director Comey
[34:17.000 --> 34:25.000]  Saying back on May 3rd that no one in the Trump administration that no one period had tried to influence their investigation
[34:25.000 --> 34:34.000]  The reason that story was big and the reason we were pointing it out is because we have him months before again in this memo
[34:34.000 --> 34:42.000]  Supposedly saying Trump was trying to influence him and now he's come out and said he now believes Trump was trying to influence him
[34:42.000 --> 34:49.000]  And the sources say that's from CNN yesterday on Saturday
[34:49.000 --> 34:56.000]  So there you go, why is it important? Because two months after he writes a memo that's secret he says no one tries to influence him
[34:56.000 --> 35:04.000]  So he lied to Congress! So if you're fake news like MSNBC how do you respond? Let's go through it
[35:04.000 --> 35:09.000]  Stock surged as trading floors watched breaking info wars video
[35:09.000 --> 35:16.000]  It was two weeks old and wrong, yes what was breaking is the memo and so it contradicted it and no one had pointed it out
[35:16.000 --> 35:21.000]  Yes breaking, breaking, continuing
[35:21.000 --> 35:31.000]  As a video circulated that appeared to partially absolve President Donald Trump and the administration's Russian meddling scandal on trading floors Thursday
[35:31.000 --> 35:36.000]  Stock surged for the first time in days on the apparent breaking news
[35:36.000 --> 35:41.000]  See how horrible info wars is just trying to have the country be successful by telling the truth
[35:41.000 --> 35:47.000]  The video it turns out was actually two weeks old, misleadingly edited
[35:47.000 --> 35:53.000]  With the intention of falsely accusing former FBI Director James Comey of perjury
[35:53.000 --> 36:00.000]  No, we said he's committing perjury or the memo doesn't exist or is a lie, that's clear
[36:00.000 --> 36:07.000]  It's called deductive reasoning and was initially aired by conspiracy website info wars on Thursday around noon
[36:07.000 --> 36:16.000]  Ooh, oh they caught us out in public pointing out hey look this video from a few weeks ago has him contradicting him from two months ago
[36:16.000 --> 36:22.000]  That's totally pertinent, they go what do we do about logic, just change the subject, just call Alex a liar when they're the liars
[36:22.000 --> 36:29.000]  This is incredible, it's not about us folks, it's about them trying to plunge the stock market and thinking you're so stupid that if someone says two months ago
[36:29.000 --> 36:34.000]  Trump tried to influence them secretly and then two months later they're in front of Congress saying it never happened
[36:34.000 --> 36:38.000]  He's lying, we have him red-handed
[36:38.000 --> 36:42.000]  But see they can't let us have the victory so they have to play a mind game and go that's all fake
[36:42.000 --> 36:47.000]  Yes the video says that but just don't worry about it
[36:47.000 --> 36:52.000]  It goes on, Trump wasn't cleared, in fact, oh they used the word in fact
[36:52.000 --> 36:56.000]  In fact the moons made of cheese, since the video had been around since May 3rd
[36:56.000 --> 37:02.000]  Oh, nothing had changed at all except there was a brand new memo out
[37:02.000 --> 37:08.000]  An old memo we can't see, but see in the space time continuum it's supposedly from February
[37:08.000 --> 37:14.000]  Oh but we, oh I'm able to have a memory, I know that February's before May so I'm a conspiracy theorist
[37:14.000 --> 37:19.000]  By the time the traders found out the dollar index had spiked anyways
[37:19.000 --> 37:23.000]  Oh by the time they found out that it was from May 3rd it spiked
[37:23.000 --> 37:28.000]  Oh that evil Alex Jones, oh that evil Kit Daniels, that evil info wars
[37:28.000 --> 37:36.000]  He believed how dirty we are folks, promoting freedom, national sovereignty, free market, second amendment, religious freedom
[37:36.000 --> 37:45.000]  Thank God Stephen Colbert spent 10 minutes lying about me on Friday night saying I lie to people and I'm a horrible person
[37:45.000 --> 37:53.000]  And I lie to people for a living, no you read off a teleprompter and you're a liar and you lie for a living
[37:53.000 --> 37:58.000]  And so does the Daily Beast, you're a joke, it's why you're falling apart
[37:58.000 --> 38:02.000]  The fallout of the story is leaving analysts wondering how to absorb information
[38:02.000 --> 38:10.000]  Oh my gosh, in a market that is suddenly waiting on bated breath for the latest rumors to come true out of the White House
[38:10.000 --> 38:15.000]  Or even where those rumors are intentionally misleading or untrue
[38:15.000 --> 38:21.000]  We played a clip of the FBI director two months after he wrote a memo saying Trump influenced him
[38:21.000 --> 38:25.000]  Or tried to influence him, obstruction of justice, saying it never happened
[38:25.000 --> 38:31.000]  That's important, it impedes him now bringing the memo out two months later that they won't show us
[38:31.000 --> 38:35.000]  They won't show us a memo, we've got public statements of him contradicting the memo
[38:35.000 --> 38:43.000]  Two months after it's supposedly written, that's fake news, that's like Muhammad Ali winning his first Heavyweight championship
[38:43.000 --> 38:49.000]  And then they go, look at him he's pathetic, he loses it, you're like he's the worst boxer in the world
[38:49.000 --> 38:53.000]  You fake news, you're like he just won, no he didn't, he won but it's fake
[38:53.000 --> 38:47.000]  It's like...
[38:47.000 --> 38:51.040]  He's the worst boxer in the world. You fake news. You're like he just won. No, he didn't
[38:51.560 --> 38:54.200]  He won, but it's fake. It's it's like
[38:58.400 --> 39:03.840]  So saying Meryl Monroe has blonde hair. No, she does it. It's green. You're fake news
[39:07.520 --> 39:12.080]  You can keep your doctor obamacare is free. Thank God. You're so dumb. That's a real quote from Gruber
[39:12.080 --> 39:17.400]  Just thank God you're so dumb. Well, I don't think you're dumb. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe maybe the Daily Beast is right
[39:17.400 --> 39:19.400]  You are idiots
[39:20.680 --> 39:27.200]  Even though those rumors were intentionally misleading or untrue. Yeah, the rumors, uh-huh the market is used to
[39:27.760 --> 39:34.720]  Trading on rumors. There's always rumors of takeovers or bankruptcies in those situations when you bet on a rumor you lose big time
[39:34.720 --> 39:40.520]  Adam Button the chief currency analyst of 4x live told the Daily Beast
[39:40.520 --> 39:46.080]  But don't worry they were able to tap down the clip of him contradicting himself from two months before and
[39:46.640 --> 39:49.080]  And they were able to get that market down. So don't worry
[39:49.480 --> 39:56.600]  Your pension funds may go down the country may go belly up. Don't worry. The globalists are trying to make sure you don't have a future right now
[39:56.600 --> 39:58.600]  Okay, they're working hard
[39:58.600 --> 40:00.600]  Those they may stop us. Don't worry
[40:00.600 --> 40:06.400]  But in the chief currency and analyst of 4x live told the Daily Beast with political rumors
[40:06.640 --> 40:08.640]  They don't have to be true
[40:08.640 --> 40:11.760]  And they keep saying I'm a liar. I'm a liar. I'm a liar never showing it
[40:12.440 --> 40:14.440]  In other words, the news can be fake
[40:14.440 --> 40:18.120]  But the rally it creates in the stock market is very real
[40:18.600 --> 40:23.200]  Button who was one of the first to trace the bump in American dollar back to info wars on Thursday
[40:23.800 --> 40:26.360]  Let's see. We have no power. We're nobody though. That's right
[40:26.360 --> 40:31.320]  We need to be shut down immediately though because God forbid we break stuff because you know, we'll see the guy
[40:31.640 --> 40:35.160]  Contradicting himself two months later. We think that's important. You think that's important
[40:35.160 --> 40:41.120]  But see they don't want you to see that. That's why we need to be sued into oblivion and shut down because you know
[40:41.880 --> 40:43.880]  We're loyal to the truth
[40:44.440 --> 40:46.440]  I'm really loyal the truth
[40:46.880 --> 40:54.480]  In an unprecedented time the markets getting a taste of what post truth world looks like where we can finally challenge the liars and MSM
[40:54.480 --> 40:57.200]  Yeah, that's the post truth world button said
[40:57.720 --> 41:05.000]  An info or segment an article posted around noon title breaking comey caught committing perjury to Congress shows comey saying he has not
[41:05.000 --> 41:08.920]  Been pressured to close an investigation. He wanted to say by anybody
[41:10.120 --> 41:15.760]  They then spin it to go but the deception was him. Jones didn't point out in the video. They were talking about the attorney general
[41:15.760 --> 41:20.000]  We played that part. We played at you lying sacks of manure
[41:20.000 --> 41:24.240]  God these people are pathetic. Excuse me. I don't mean these lords
[41:25.520 --> 41:30.480]  Yes, I'm getting angry because they're just such trash. I mean what the hell excuse me
[41:32.360 --> 41:36.000]  The clip on info wars amidst the question asked by Hawaii senator
[41:36.560 --> 41:43.680]  Maisie Hirono especially asked comey the Attorney General Department of Justice has asked him to close investigation and doesn't mention President Trump
[41:43.680 --> 41:51.600]  What we that's the clip the clip they say has the Attorney General or anybody try to do this and he's he says he says no one
[41:51.720 --> 41:55.920]  No one has we take it really serious. No one chew it up again
[41:56.920 --> 41:58.920]  And then they say that we lied
[41:59.640 --> 42:01.640]  And did not show it
[42:02.320 --> 42:04.320]  Even though they linked to the article that shows that
[42:04.920 --> 42:06.920]  Here is the clip
[42:07.160 --> 42:10.440]  So if the Attorney General or senior officials at the Department of Justice
[42:10.440 --> 42:16.320]  Opposes a specific investigation. Can they halt that FBI investigation?
[42:17.240 --> 42:19.240]  In theory. Yes
[42:19.800 --> 42:21.640]  Has it happened?
[42:21.640 --> 42:27.280]  Not in my experience because it would be a big deal to tell the FBI to stop doing something that
[42:27.560 --> 42:33.360]  Without a appropriate purpose. I mean we're oftentimes they give us opinions that we don't see a case there
[42:33.360 --> 42:35.360]  And so you ought to stop investing resources in it
[42:35.360 --> 42:41.000]  But I'm talking about a situation where we were told to stop something for a political reason. That would be a very big deal
[42:41.280 --> 42:47.360]  It's not happened in my experience. It says info wars omitted that no you are frauds you are liars
[42:47.480 --> 42:53.160]  You are the definition of anti-american trash. You make the old soviet problem look truthful all of you
[42:53.160 --> 42:56.560]  I can't cover all the lies because everything's like this these people

[47:34.600 --> 47:45.520]  All right folks we are back live I'm gonna open the phones up in the second hour I'm gonna play excerpts
[47:46.600 --> 47:51.760]  President Trump's speech in Riyadh Saudi Arabia very historic if you my different angles on that did he battle the king or did he not
[47:52.200 --> 47:57.920]  We're gonna go over that he didn't do it like Obama did from the waist down, but he did curtsy. We're gonna discuss that
[47:59.040 --> 48:01.240]  But I've got to just put bookends on this
[48:01.240 --> 48:05.040]  Before we go any further and I'm gonna give you the numbers he can join us on air
[48:05.920 --> 48:12.400]  It isn't making me mad that Stephen Colbert who poses as an as a comedian who really is an
[48:13.120 --> 48:19.480]  Actor who is playing the part of a newscaster so he can get away with deceiving people gets up there and lies about me
[48:19.480 --> 48:23.200]  And what I've said what I've done. I mean it's whole cloth just none of it's even true
[48:23.200 --> 48:33.120]  And then he says things that I've reportedly done that aren't even true as well. It's just it's just crazy
[48:34.320 --> 48:36.320]  It's absolutely crazy
[48:36.480 --> 48:41.280]  How they operate the whole shabani yogurt thing they want a confidentiality in the settlement
[48:41.800 --> 48:46.160]  And then Colbert's up there saying I paid all this money also the stuff and I'm sitting there
[48:46.720 --> 48:51.400]  Watching coordination in the media within five minutes of the settlement coming out last week
[48:51.400 --> 48:56.240]  With what was in the settlement at least parts of it already out in the news and I'm supposed to sit here
[48:56.240 --> 48:58.240]  While people are saying things that aren't true
[48:58.320 --> 49:00.320]  It's just crazy
[49:00.320 --> 49:02.320]  And so they're just sitting there waiting
[49:03.400 --> 49:06.480]  Into my Twitter feed for us to send out a link to somebody's article
[49:07.920 --> 49:12.800]  Saying that a particular company brought in migrants that ended up doing bad things when excuse me
[49:12.800 --> 49:18.640]  It's the UN and the globalists that bring them in it's not the company officially so I clarify that
[49:18.640 --> 49:20.640]  and
[49:20.920 --> 49:23.320]  Then oh I admit I'm fake news and
[49:24.520 --> 49:29.840]  Then he goes on air and says a bunch of things I never said I'm tough but for I hate gay people
[49:30.600 --> 49:34.440]  And I admit that's wrong now never said that and he did the same stuff
[49:34.440 --> 49:38.960]  He does over and over again, so it's interesting. Can he hide behind saying he's a comedian?
[49:39.760 --> 49:45.200]  To then play a part who's Alex Jones and say things that aren't true
[49:45.200 --> 49:50.640]  I'm gonna go to Paul watch this report here in a moment, but getting back to the Daily Beast
[49:51.960 --> 49:55.920]  Alex Jones didn't show the part where they said that they asked if the Justice Department had done it
[49:56.920 --> 50:01.520]  Well the clip we had in the article. It was just played has that the article they linked to has that
[50:02.480 --> 50:06.040]  They go and it's an old clip because it was a clip that came months after the memo
[50:06.400 --> 50:07.920]  Showing that months after the memo
[50:07.920 --> 50:12.960]  He said no one tried to influence him and then he says no one no one no one not just the Justice Department
[50:12.960 --> 50:19.440]  No, one's tried that he clearly says the president everybody no one no one no one means no one I
[50:20.800 --> 50:26.600]  Know you call that being conspiracy terrorists that I have common sense, but no one means no one I'll stand on that
[50:28.560 --> 50:34.080]  So it just shows how they're praying on their viewers and breaking the public trust and think you're so stupid
[50:34.240 --> 50:40.520]  Everything they say is a massive lie and I can't counter it all there's hundreds of them. They're all like this
[50:40.520 --> 50:42.520]  It's all just incredible
[50:43.000 --> 50:47.640]  Jones loves David Duke David Duke hates me go to his website
[50:47.640 --> 50:51.800]  It's it call it they have no proof of me ever saying that they just say he loves David Duke
[50:51.800 --> 50:55.420]  He hates black people. He doesn't like Obamacare. I'm Rachel Maddow
[50:56.360 --> 50:59.240]  Those are quotes and my lawyers go. Yeah, you can sue them and win, but I
[51:01.200 --> 51:07.080]  Guess I just I just I just have to start suing everybody. I guess like they do I just because it's just it's crazy
[51:07.080 --> 51:09.080]  How they lie it just gets worse and worse
[51:09.080 --> 51:10.160]  I
[51:10.160 --> 51:13.120]  Want to air Paul Watson's report. It's very powerful. We had great products
[51:13.120 --> 51:16.120]  We do support more than ever just spread the articles the videos the links they hate us

[52:06.360 --> 52:09.280]  Now in closing so I'm gonna go to this important report by Paul Watson
[52:10.320 --> 52:17.160]  The globalist aren't just trying to stop plugs the stock market. They're trying to cause economic turmoil to bring in
[52:18.600 --> 52:23.760]  Racial and religious unrest to then bring in a global police state and a new international order
[52:23.760 --> 52:29.360]  That's their admitted plan by Soros and others and so to bring down trumpet to bring on other nationalists in the UK
[52:29.360 --> 52:36.400]  The globalists are admitting a plan to foment more cop killing more race war more garbage going into this summer
[52:36.400 --> 52:40.120]  Here's Paul Joseph Watson info wars.com editors report
[52:40.120 --> 52:54.800]  All signs are pointing to a summer of rage that could see nationwide anti-trump protests boil over into full-blown
[52:55.480 --> 53:03.480]  Violent riots the deep state the Democratic Party establishment Republican insiders and the mainstream media are all hysterically pushing the notion that
[53:03.480 --> 53:10.960]  Trump is illegitimate the impeachment proceedings are inevitable that Trump committed a crime by blocking Comey's FBI investigation
[53:10.960 --> 53:14.200]  Despite the fact that Comey admitted under oath that no FBI
[53:14.680 --> 53:20.680]  Investigations have ever been blocked situation where we were told to stop something for a political reason. That would be a very big deal
[53:20.960 --> 53:22.640]  It's not happened in my experience
[53:22.640 --> 53:29.440]  But facts don't matter narrative matters and the narrative is clearly to manufacture a constitutional crisis
[53:29.440 --> 53:36.040]  Followed by a coup d'etat. This will radicalize the violent alt left to engage in massive domestic disorder
[53:36.520 --> 53:43.520]  Emboldened by the belief that they are bravely resisting an actual tyrant left badly wants to remove Donald Trump from office
[53:43.520 --> 53:47.400]  Not with votes in the next presidential election as you typically see in working democracies
[53:47.440 --> 53:51.840]  But they want to remove him right now today indeed the left has grown so impatient
[53:52.320 --> 53:58.120]  Much more than ever that it is now unable to acknowledge the basic legitimacy of any government act. They disagree with
[53:58.120 --> 54:03.160]  Every executive order is a new opportunity to demand massive resistance to the law itself
[54:03.160 --> 54:10.000]  When could the flashpoint take place the New York Times reports quote liberals are planning a series of nationwide protests on July
[54:10.000 --> 54:15.480]  The second known as impeachment marches to increase the pressure in preparation for this left
[54:15.480 --> 54:20.920]  This are attending summer resistance camps generously bankrolled by the DNC
[54:20.920 --> 54:27.360]  Is this the day when the saw Ross controlled agitators will be activated to cause mayhem now beneath all of this?
[54:27.360 --> 54:33.200]  Which is it's the monster under the bed. It's the threat of violence at this stage only the fringes are calling for that
[54:33.200 --> 54:37.080]  But the rest of us know it's there we can feel it sometimes especially recently
[54:37.080 --> 54:42.400]  We can see it and that is the end or the beginning of it violence is what separates politics from war
[54:42.400 --> 54:48.880]  It's the point where hurt feelings become dead bodies the point at which countries become ungovernable rally organizers have made it clear
[54:48.880 --> 54:55.600]  They literally think Trump is a dictator and are staging this nationwide event to quote get him out now
[54:55.600 --> 55:03.680]  Another militant leftist group bam claim they're fighting a fascist movement and that quote Trump must go by any means
[55:04.040 --> 55:07.880]  Necessary this is what they're going into schools and telling young people
[55:16.520 --> 55:23.760]  They literally claim quote the future existence of humankind is at risk if Trump stays in power
[55:23.760 --> 55:32.480]  This is how unhinged these lunatics are they want to quote shut down entire cities to quote drive Trump out of power
[55:32.600 --> 55:38.840]  To overthrow him they openly denounce quote liberal tactics of electoral engagement
[55:38.840 --> 55:44.480]  This group has previously been discussed by the FBI in the context of alleged links to terrorist
[55:44.960 --> 55:51.800]  Organizations at a rally in Sacramento last year 10 people were hospitalized with stab wounds as a result of violence
[55:51.800 --> 56:00.400]  Initiated by members of BAM. These are the same people who were involved in the Berkeley riots and the riots in airports over the travel ban
[56:00.680 --> 56:07.600]  Imagine Berkeley, but nationwide in dozens of major cities all on the same day
[56:08.080 --> 56:09.800]  Imagine the chaos
[56:09.800 --> 56:15.880]  Demonstrations are also set to take place in over 90 cities on June the 3rd to protest against Russian
[56:15.880 --> 56:23.720]  Interference in the US election for which there's no evidence whatsoever other than a relentless stream of hysteria as Tucker Carlson exposed
[56:23.920 --> 56:30.760]  Prominent leftists are also refusing to condemn violence when asked endorsing violence is that's the line and she crossed it
[56:30.840 --> 56:33.800]  Right. Well, I don't know if we'd have our current president if that was the line
[56:33.800 --> 56:38.680]  She has a right to say what she thinks is that a legitimate tactic to smash windows
[56:38.680 --> 56:42.920]  It's not an effective tactic. It's a legitimate more. That's up to the people who organize it. So it's okay
[56:42.920 --> 56:46.600]  There are times when using violence. I never use violence. We've never had the gay
[56:46.600 --> 56:51.920]  I'm asking a philosophical question and I'm saying I can't answer every question when violence is a personal or not

[1:00:05.220 --> 1:00:16.660]  Well, I saw Trump declare war on radical Islam from the heart
[1:00:18.300 --> 1:00:23.340]  From the nerve center of radical Islam where Saudi Arabia oppresses it controls it
[1:00:23.900 --> 1:00:27.940]  Radicalizes it and then focuses it like a bullet out of a barrel
[1:00:27.940 --> 1:00:34.660]  You say, well, how can they be behind it? But then it's one of their biggest enemies because it's the monster. They keep down in the basement
[1:00:35.220 --> 1:00:37.220]  So I'm gonna open the phones up
[1:00:37.700 --> 1:00:39.700]  for first-time callers
[1:00:40.580 --> 1:00:42.420]  Specifically on Saudi Arabia
[1:00:42.420 --> 1:00:46.940]  Well, you think it's a master stroke Trump going over there and making the United States 350 billion dollars and
[1:00:47.380 --> 1:00:52.260]  Getting all the other Arab countries and African countries that are Islamic to vote to create a new digital system
[1:00:52.260 --> 1:01:00.180]  To watch the currency trading of the terrorist organizations and to have a partnership with Trump the United States and Saudi Arabia
[1:01:00.180 --> 1:01:04.340]  And to have Israel give concessions for a new peace deal where Trump's about to go to Israel
[1:01:04.340 --> 1:01:10.340]  Let's try to actually in the Arab Spring and actually try to bring order to the region by defeating al Qaeda and ISIS
[1:01:11.420 --> 1:01:13.420]  Because that's how you go and you broker
[1:01:14.180 --> 1:01:18.900]  That's how you come with a big stick, but you walk softly steady Roosevelt said walk softly
[1:01:18.900 --> 1:01:21.460]  Let's carry a big stick. I
[1:01:24.100 --> 1:01:27.380]  Know that Trump has the globalist against him the current special interest
[1:01:27.380 --> 1:01:31.940]  I know he's gotten three trillion the stock market. They're trying to reverse that right now and three trillion
[1:01:32.500 --> 1:01:39.020]  300 billion in new jobs and all the rest the numbers we all know about the good Supreme Court nominee and a lot of other positive things killing TPP
[1:01:39.020 --> 1:01:41.020]  The list goes on and on
[1:01:41.580 --> 1:01:43.580]  But I'm not religiously behind Trump
[1:01:43.580 --> 1:01:48.860]  I mean, let me tell you him criticizing Obama for bowing from the waist. He did it many times though and
[1:01:51.940 --> 1:01:53.460]  Then
[1:01:53.460 --> 1:01:55.260]  curtsy a little bit
[1:01:55.260 --> 1:01:59.300]  That made me a little bit nauseous, but but I get it. He's taller than the king
[1:02:00.260 --> 1:02:04.020]  Kings an old man. He's got to get down to put it on. He didn't bow from the waist
[1:02:04.740 --> 1:02:09.020]  He just curtsy who would come up with who would think to be like that? That's only Trump
[1:02:09.020 --> 1:02:14.020]  He's being you know, I mean, what are you supposed to do? He doesn't he just curtsy the guy could put it down over to say
[1:02:14.020 --> 1:02:16.020]  He just bent from the knees
[1:02:16.460 --> 1:02:19.100]  And he went out let the guys wave the swords around and did it all
[1:02:19.900 --> 1:02:26.260]  Which I find to be very very ridiculous, but cute. I mean, you know, oh Trump bowed down
[1:02:26.620 --> 1:02:28.300]  leaned over second put a
[1:02:28.300 --> 1:02:30.820]  Award around his neck at the black church. Nobody's thought of that
[1:02:30.820 --> 1:02:36.180]  Let's go to the black church in in Michigan where he gets the award and I thought that was one of the most heartfelt times for Trump
[1:02:36.180 --> 1:02:40.100]  We when they received the blessing and their prayers or everything else
[1:02:40.100 --> 1:02:45.300]  I thought that was powerful and I thought those black folks had a lot of courage to back Trump the middle of the campaign like that
[1:02:45.540 --> 1:02:47.540]  Their second being poor. They want prosperity, too
[1:02:47.780 --> 1:02:53.300]  Trump's been delivering by the way massive new factors getting announced in mainly black areas in Michigan and other areas of Illinois
[1:02:53.300 --> 1:02:55.780]  The Democrats are trying to block it, but it's gotten so good though
[1:02:55.780 --> 1:03:00.980]  Even Governor Cuomo is trying to ask him for help now in New York with some deals because I mean Trump's getting investment in
[1:03:00.980 --> 1:03:05.060]  Look at the Secretary of State and look at the
[1:03:08.660 --> 1:03:12.740]  We'll look at Wilbur Ross and look at all these people dancing with the swords
[1:03:12.740 --> 1:03:16.620]  I mean when you know when you're in Rome do as the Romans do you wouldn't be seeing
[1:03:18.620 --> 1:03:20.620]  You wouldn't be seeing Obama going that far
[1:03:22.620 --> 1:03:26.780]  So it's one thing it is is entertaining so here's the toll-free number
[1:03:26.780 --> 1:03:32.380]  You think you sold us out? You think it's a stroke of genius too early to tell? What do you think of the so-called peace still?
[1:03:32.380 --> 1:03:36.860]  He's pushing what do you think of the FBI? We're on topic today folks a couple different big topics
[1:03:36.860 --> 1:03:38.860]  We're thinking the FBI memo
[1:03:39.060 --> 1:03:42.860]  Two months before he gives testimony saying
[1:03:44.180 --> 1:03:49.300]  There was no obstruction of justice nobody tried to get him to stop his investigation from the Trump administration
[1:03:49.700 --> 1:03:53.740]  Isn't that big? We're like four days in info wars breaking this big
[1:03:53.740 --> 1:04:01.500]  And the media is so controlled they're trying to spend it that we're lying. Well, I mean it's like saying no, I mean
[1:04:02.180 --> 1:04:04.180]  then January or
[1:04:04.700 --> 1:04:11.260]  February comes earlier than May because I'm not lying if that's the case and I last time I checked may may comes after
[1:04:11.820 --> 1:04:13.820]  February right
[1:04:14.700 --> 1:04:18.420]  Okay, and then they said that I didn't mention this the Justice Department part
[1:04:19.060 --> 1:04:22.060]  But that I played that clip. That's that's what's in our article. What?
[1:04:22.060 --> 1:04:26.660]  So that they just think you're not paying attention and think you're dumb. I don't think you are
[1:04:27.580 --> 1:04:33.300]  The toll-free number is 877-789-2539. I sure hope the public hidden because we're screwed if we're not
[1:04:34.020 --> 1:04:40.580]  877-789-ALEX 877-789-ALEX a different number than the weekdays when we're syndicated through GCN
[1:04:40.580 --> 1:04:45.740]  I have my own number here on Sundays 877-789-ALEX and we will
[1:04:46.540 --> 1:04:49.940]  Take your calls in about 10 seconds. We go to break. We will
[1:04:49.940 --> 1:04:56.820]  Come back on the other side and again take your phone calls on this live global Sunday transmission. Please stay with us
[1:04:58.860 --> 1:05:02.660]  Trump put out a statement saying what you are seeing is
[1:05:03.340 --> 1:05:09.460]  Sabotage the fake news media is working hand-in-hand with Washington's corrupt
[1:05:09.900 --> 1:05:13.460]  bureaucracy to try to slow and block out our
[1:05:13.460 --> 1:05:22.060]  America first agenda with so many forces out to ruin us. We are turning to you and our most trusted supporters at this
[1:05:22.340 --> 1:05:27.580]  Critical moment on Trump's website. He has set up a drain the swamp campaign
[1:05:28.300 --> 1:05:34.940]  Asking for contributions to help in the swamp draining process. He says we have no choice
[1:05:34.940 --> 1:05:39.860]  But to completely drain the swamp. I have already started cleaning house
[1:05:39.860 --> 1:05:44.140]  But every day from here on out will be an uphill battle
[1:05:44.140 --> 1:05:50.140]  And we need to be prepared to go into the trenches to fight back for more reports
[1:05:50.140 --> 1:06:19.380]  Let's go to info wars.com. I'm Millie Weaver reporting. We now take you live to the central Texas
[1:06:19.380 --> 1:06:24.180]  Commence Center in the heart of the resistance. It's Alex Jones
[1:06:24.700 --> 1:06:27.260]  Well, nobody said it would be easy, but it sure been fun
[1:06:27.260 --> 1:06:33.700]  We have built the number one opposition platform to unelected corporate global government on the planet. It's called info wars
[1:06:34.220 --> 1:06:39.620]  And it's under unprecedented incredible attacks and lies from corporate media at the Federal Reserve Board
[1:06:40.180 --> 1:06:46.420]  Foreign governments you name it because we are here speaking out for common sense and an open free market society because we believe
[1:06:46.420 --> 1:06:50.740]  It's better for everybody to live in a free open society. I've given the number out
[1:06:51.740 --> 1:06:55.660]  The phones have loaded the number to say seven seven seven eight nine Alex
[1:06:55.780 --> 1:07:02.260]  Do you think Trump went and bowed to radical Islam to the fount for the birthplace to the spigot of
[1:07:03.380 --> 1:07:06.180]  Where the orthodox slave trading women or slaves
[1:07:07.420 --> 1:07:11.540]  System comes from or did he go there as an ultimatum in their face saying?
[1:07:11.540 --> 1:07:16.260]  Terrorism will be destroyed radicalism will be stopped you better roll over against it
[1:07:16.260 --> 1:07:22.020]  You better stop playing both sides of it during your shooting Sunni Shiite Civil War or
[1:07:22.540 --> 1:07:28.620]  You're not gonna have any future for you and your families. I think it was bold to go say to their face inside the big
[1:07:29.660 --> 1:07:36.340]  Saudi Arab United Nations Muslim United Nations building they've got where everybody from the Muslim nations
[1:07:36.340 --> 1:07:41.420]  Because notice you're either from a Muslim nation or you're not nobody else gets invited and
[1:07:42.260 --> 1:07:45.420]  The women can't drive cars and wear hoods over their heads and millennia
[1:07:45.740 --> 1:07:51.420]  Trump goes to some factory that's got 200 women working at it and she's got there with her sexy dress on saying well
[1:07:51.420 --> 1:07:53.420]  We're hoping for balance and some progress
[1:07:55.220 --> 1:07:58.220]  Well, I mean Trump's got to go you know negotiate
[1:07:58.860 --> 1:08:01.300]  He just better not sell us out the Saudi Arabian
[1:08:01.300 --> 1:08:07.180]  And he's got reported concessions from Israel on some new peace deal with Palestine
[1:08:07.180 --> 1:08:12.300]  So if he can be the big deal maker, this is really about Trump trying to show the world that he can bring peace
[1:08:14.420 --> 1:08:18.140]  Well more power to him if he can get the Saudi Arabians to stop finding funding ISIS
[1:08:18.700 --> 1:08:21.500]  The more power to him as well. I'm gonna your phone calls here in just a few minutes
[1:08:21.500 --> 1:08:25.860]  But here's the end of the speech that I agree with CJ's some of the more powerful parts of it
[1:08:25.860 --> 1:08:28.980]  But the full 34 minute speeches on info wars calm
[1:08:28.980 --> 1:08:30.980]  I mean, let me tell you
[1:08:31.980 --> 1:08:33.980]  it's head-turning
[1:08:34.420 --> 1:08:36.420]  because
[1:08:36.540 --> 1:08:42.100]  You got to come with a stick first to look strong and be strong within your concessions from the Islamists
[1:08:42.100 --> 1:08:47.060]  You don't come acting weak in the concessions. We didn't get that with Obama. We saw the spread of radical Islam everywhere
[1:08:47.140 --> 1:08:51.980]  So overall, I like what Trump's doing. It takes a lot of wavos to go and do what he's doing
[1:08:51.980 --> 1:08:59.500]  But I'm cautiously supportive at this point and maybe when I hear your calls, you'll bring up points that make me think
[1:08:59.500 --> 1:09:03.660]  I'm wrong because we don't censor your calls. Don't worry about disagreeing with me or agreeing
[1:09:03.820 --> 1:09:09.340]  Just call in and then tell what you really think we'll be going to Michael and Chris and Mark and many others
[1:09:09.340 --> 1:09:12.140]  We go to your calls. Don't hang up. We got like 20 phone lines
[1:09:12.140 --> 1:09:16.340]  We got to go through each person one at a time and get your name where you're calling from and we'll go to you
[1:09:16.340 --> 1:09:22.300]  But I know this if I'm a Christian, which I am I can't go to Saudi Arabian preach it
[1:09:22.700 --> 1:09:25.220]  So I shouldn't have to take a bunch of Saudi Arabians here
[1:09:25.900 --> 1:09:28.340]  Because you don't comply with our open society
[1:09:28.340 --> 1:09:33.220]  You can have your country and put women in cages and hoods over their heads. I guess living like live, huh?
[1:09:33.820 --> 1:09:39.020]  That's how your culture is just don't come here with the leftist and then you know try to sue everybody
[1:09:39.140 --> 1:09:45.420]  So we open the borders up and you know have genital mutilation like in my Abedin's mama pushes and you know legalized
[1:09:45.420 --> 1:09:47.420]  pedophilia like they have in Saudi Arabia and
[1:09:47.860 --> 1:09:51.780]  No, oh, by the way, Anthony Weiner just pled guilty and we first broke the
[1:09:52.380 --> 1:09:58.060]  Sexting in the 15 year old girl. That was just the tip of the iceberg. Oh, that was our fake news reported back in early November
[1:09:59.620 --> 1:10:05.100]  So there you go, that's all of course happening as we told you it would but we're gonna go ahead and play a few minutes of Trump
[1:10:05.100 --> 1:10:06.140]  Here it is
[1:10:06.140 --> 1:10:08.140]  The decisions we make
[1:10:08.460 --> 1:10:10.740]  Will affect countless lives
[1:10:10.740 --> 1:10:22.060]  King Solomon I thank you for the creation of this great moment in history and for your massive investments in
[1:10:22.940 --> 1:10:27.100]  America and its industries and its jobs. I
[1:10:28.140 --> 1:10:33.460]  Also, thank you for investing in the future of this part of the world
[1:10:34.460 --> 1:10:37.860]  the fertile region and it is so fertile has
[1:10:38.820 --> 1:10:40.420]  all
[1:10:40.420 --> 1:10:44.180]  the ingredients for extraordinary success a
[1:10:45.300 --> 1:10:47.300]  rich history and culture a
[1:10:47.860 --> 1:10:50.180]  young and vibrant people a
[1:10:51.100 --> 1:10:52.180]  thriving
[1:10:52.180 --> 1:10:59.340]  Spirit of enterprise that's a good point, but you can only unlock this future if the citizens of the Middle East are freed from
[1:10:59.860 --> 1:11:04.940]  Extremism look at that fabulous wealth and violence. How about a meeting room?
[1:11:04.940 --> 1:11:12.340]  Are the leaders of our peoples that are pimps trump. They look to us for answers and for action
[1:11:12.340 --> 1:11:15.020]  And when we look back at their faces
[1:11:15.620 --> 1:11:18.660]  behind every pair of eyes is a soul
[1:11:19.620 --> 1:11:23.220]  That yearns for justice and yearns for peace
[1:11:24.420 --> 1:11:28.140]  Today billions of faces are now looking at us
[1:11:28.980 --> 1:11:33.860]  Waiting for us to act on the great question of our time
[1:11:33.860 --> 1:11:38.380]  Will we be indifferent in the presence of evil?
[1:11:39.460 --> 1:11:44.860]  Will we protect our citizens from its violent ideology?
[1:11:46.260 --> 1:11:53.420]  Think about this. He's in the heart of radical orthodox Islam where they use it to project power outward but are scared of it inward
[1:11:54.460 --> 1:11:59.620]  Actually trying to get them to stop it and saying they'll be big war if you don't there'll be a carpet of
[1:12:00.260 --> 1:12:02.420]  Bombs if you don't or carpet of gold if you do
[1:12:02.420 --> 1:12:07.780]  You look at the king of Saudi Arabia. He's acting actually scared of Trump. I've actually watched the other stuff with Obama
[1:12:08.100 --> 1:12:11.700]  He never addressed the Muslims like this. He never got them together to sign a deal
[1:12:11.700 --> 1:12:17.020]  He never actually tried to go in there and bring them to the table. It was all just pat them on the head and then
[1:12:18.220 --> 1:12:20.740]  Make some deal to turn al-qaeda an ISIS list
[1:12:21.780 --> 1:12:25.140]  and see I wouldn't be trusting Trump here if he hadn't had this the
[1:12:25.940 --> 1:12:29.260]  Vice president come out and say the UN had met double the murder of Christians
[1:12:29.260 --> 1:12:34.060]  We're gonna stand up for Christians. It's wrong for Muslim countries to be killing Christians. Saudi Arabia shouldn't be on the
[1:12:34.580 --> 1:12:37.580]  human rights women's board Saudi Arabia should should
[1:12:38.660 --> 1:12:40.660]  reform itself
[1:12:41.060 --> 1:12:47.500]  So the sticks brought in Trump flies into the middle of it see Obama would kiss butt and then go into the middle of it
[1:12:47.500 --> 1:12:53.140]  Trump comes with a stick beats them over the head with it then flies right in the middle of the hornet's nest to address them
[1:12:53.140 --> 1:12:56.940]  They really respect that he's getting their attention right here. They look completely freaked out
[1:12:56.940 --> 1:13:01.340]  I mean Donald Trump the Muslim hater is now right in the middle of him what she isn't the Muslim hater
[1:13:01.340 --> 1:13:04.980]  He doesn't like the part about you know blowing everything up. Here it is
[1:13:06.340 --> 1:13:09.340]  Will we let its venom spread?
[1:13:10.180 --> 1:13:15.620]  Through our societies back to the snake will we let it destroy the most holy sites?
[1:13:17.140 --> 1:13:18.660]  on earth
[1:13:18.660 --> 1:13:21.380]  If we do not confront this deadly terror
[1:13:21.380 --> 1:13:27.700]  We know what the future will bring more suffering more death and more despair
[1:13:28.700 --> 1:13:30.700]  But if we act
[1:13:31.260 --> 1:13:39.380]  If we leave this magnificent room unified and determined to do what it takes to destroy the terror
[1:13:40.380 --> 1:13:42.380]  That threatens the world
[1:13:42.900 --> 1:13:48.380]  Then there is no limit to the great future our citizens
[1:13:48.380 --> 1:13:50.380]  Will have
[1:13:51.380 --> 1:13:53.380]  The birthplace of civilization
[1:13:54.380 --> 1:13:57.380]  Is waiting to begin a new
[1:13:58.380 --> 1:13:59.380]  Renaissance
[1:14:00.380 --> 1:14:03.380]  Just imagine what tomorrow could bring over that word
[1:14:03.380 --> 1:14:05.380]  glorious wonders of science
[1:14:06.380 --> 1:14:09.380]  Art medicine and commerce to inspire
[1:14:10.380 --> 1:14:12.380]  Mankind
[1:14:12.380 --> 1:14:14.380]  Great cities built on the ruins
[1:14:14.380 --> 1:14:18.380]  Great cities built on the ruins of shattered towns
[1:14:19.380 --> 1:14:26.380]  New jobs and industries that will lift up millions and millions of people and by the way parents who no longer
[1:14:28.380 --> 1:14:30.380]  Oh Trump's full of bull
[1:14:30.380 --> 1:14:34.380]  He said all this about America and then we got three and a half trillion dollars in the stock market and
[1:14:35.380 --> 1:14:39.380]  300 billion of new jobs and over half a million new jobs now. It's a million everybody moving back
[1:14:39.380 --> 1:14:44.380]  Oh, but don't worry. The media is attacked it and now it's starting to fall apart. The confidence is gone
[1:14:44.380 --> 1:14:46.380]  We can do anything now with the technology we have
[1:14:48.380 --> 1:14:52.380]  You look back at a human 2,000 years ago. We're like a god compared to them technologically not culturally
[1:14:54.380 --> 1:14:58.380]  We are only a few steps away from just unlimited potential
[1:14:59.380 --> 1:15:01.380]  And Trump knows this and wants to bring in a new Renaissance
[1:15:02.380 --> 1:15:06.380]  I told you before his inauguration he would talk about Renaissance invoking God
[1:15:06.380 --> 1:15:10.380]  The birthright and secret technologies unlocking the secrets of the universe
[1:15:12.380 --> 1:15:14.380]  See there are some people that actually want to empower you
[1:15:15.380 --> 1:15:17.380]  And is Donald Trump perfect? No
[1:15:18.380 --> 1:15:20.380]  But he does not want to enslave you
[1:15:21.380 --> 1:15:26.380]  He does not feel better when you fall down and you're poor the globalist austerity model wants to make you poor
[1:15:27.380 --> 1:15:31.380]  Just like in Latin America just like in Africa just like in Asia on purpose
[1:15:31.380 --> 1:15:36.380]  You don't think Latin America doesn't have rich culture and money and resources the elites want you poor
[1:15:37.380 --> 1:15:40.380]  They do it on purpose because they're so stingy they can't help it
[1:15:41.380 --> 1:15:44.380]  Trump's trying to shatter that and that's why the elites are panicking
[1:15:44.380 --> 1:15:48.380]  We're gonna come back with your phone calls and a lot more of Trump's speech. I'm Alex Jones
[1:15:48.380 --> 1:15:50.380]  It's a revolutionary act to spread the link

[1:16:10.380 --> 1:16:12.380]  the secret to defender body armor
[1:16:12.380 --> 1:16:19.380]  It's a proprietary process and technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor
[1:16:19.380 --> 1:16:26.380]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created called ultra high molecular weight polyethylene

[1:20:28.380 --> 1:20:32.380]  We play the songs that sound more like everyone else than anyone else
[1:20:32.380 --> 1:20:35.380]  That's right, but we're breaking into this transmission right now
[1:20:35.380 --> 1:20:40.380]  Hitler took the guns, Stalin took the guns, Mal took the guns, but El Castro took the guns
[1:20:40.380 --> 1:20:41.380]  Dominique
[1:20:41.380 --> 1:20:42.380]  You though Chavez took the guns
[1:20:44.380 --> 1:20:48.380]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms
[1:20:48.380 --> 1:20:55.380]  The Republic will rise again when you attempt to take our guns
[1:21:07.380 --> 1:21:12.380]  The answer to 1984 is 1776
[1:21:12.380 --> 1:21:17.380]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:21:17.380 --> 1:21:21.380]  All right, I've tried to put a good face on this whole Trump thing, because I hope that's the case
[1:21:21.380 --> 1:21:24.380]  But I don't like seeing him curtsy when he said Obama bowed
[1:21:24.380 --> 1:21:27.380]  Obama did bow from the stomach, but we can show that again for TV viewers
[1:21:27.380 --> 1:21:30.380]  A lot of folks are watching us at infowars.com for our show
[1:21:30.380 --> 1:21:33.380]  And some cable and TV systems across the United States
[1:21:33.380 --> 1:21:35.380]  I want to thank all those great folks that are tuning in right now
[1:21:35.380 --> 1:21:42.380]  But I also don't like seeing stories about oh Melania Trump and Ivanka or all the rage and the Saudi press
[1:21:42.380 --> 1:21:48.380]  Women love watching him because women can't go outside without their husband and wear hoods over their heads
[1:21:50.380 --> 1:21:52.380]  But I got to give it to him bringing his wives there
[1:21:52.380 --> 1:21:57.380]  You know Bush didn't used to do that and having her call for reform before she left
[1:21:57.380 --> 1:21:58.380]  It's still crazy
[1:21:58.380 --> 1:22:00.380]  Your soul will be fully condemned
[1:22:00.380 --> 1:22:07.380]  Trump's Saudi Arabian speech warns terrorists their days are numbered as he implores Arab leaders to stamp out Islamic terror groups
[1:22:07.380 --> 1:22:09.380]  And drive them out of your places of worship
[1:22:09.380 --> 1:22:13.380]  Next stop for Trump is Israel in pursuit of ultimate deal
[1:22:13.380 --> 1:22:15.380]  Let's see presidents always go to Israel first
[1:22:15.380 --> 1:22:19.380]  He did this as a respect thing to the Muslims to try to get a deal with them
[1:22:19.380 --> 1:22:20.380]  We'll see what happens
[1:22:20.380 --> 1:22:23.380]  The latest Israel makes concessions ahead of Trump visit
[1:22:23.380 --> 1:22:27.380]  Saudi King slams Iran as spearhead of global terrorism
[1:22:27.380 --> 1:22:31.380]  Look, I'm not a fan of Iran and the Mullahs, neither are the Iranian people, they want them out
[1:22:31.380 --> 1:22:36.380]  But they're not the 80% of Islam Sunniism that you guys are running and taking over
[1:22:36.380 --> 1:22:40.380]  I mean Al Qaeda and ISIS are Sunnis, they're not Shiite, bro
[1:22:40.380 --> 1:22:44.380]  And women have a lot more rights in Shiite areas than they do
[1:22:44.380 --> 1:22:47.380]  I don't want to get the middle of the Muslims killing each other
[1:22:47.380 --> 1:22:50.380]  I don't hate you, just please stop trying to make me live like you
[1:22:50.380 --> 1:22:56.380]  And then having weird liberals run around behind you worshipping you and wearing hijabs and wanting to chop their daughters genitals off
[1:22:56.380 --> 1:22:59.380]  So that's just some of the news right there
[1:22:59.380 --> 1:23:00.380]  Let's go to your phone calls
[1:23:00.380 --> 1:23:03.380]  You know, I've always said if you disagree, I'll go to you first
[1:23:03.380 --> 1:23:06.380]  You don't need to preface it, just go right into it
[1:23:06.380 --> 1:23:10.380]  Michael in Florida says he disagrees with me strongly
[1:23:10.380 --> 1:23:13.380]  Maybe he thinks I'm being pro Saudi Arabia or pro what Trump's doing
[1:23:13.380 --> 1:23:15.380]  I hope this turns out good
[1:23:15.380 --> 1:23:18.380]  I don't know, I don't like a lot of what I'm seeing
[1:23:18.380 --> 1:23:21.380]  So let me be clear, I'm not endorsing what Saudi Arabia does
[1:23:21.380 --> 1:23:24.380]  But the more weapons we sell, it doesn't even cause new wars
[1:23:24.380 --> 1:23:28.380]  In the case of Saudi Arabia, they're fighting a war with Shiites that was already going on
[1:23:28.380 --> 1:23:33.380]  So selling them $350 billion, that's a tongue twister
[1:23:33.380 --> 1:23:35.380]  I mean, what are we supposed to do? That's our main export
[1:23:35.380 --> 1:23:39.380]  Trump is delivering on bringing jobs back to the US, go ahead
[1:23:39.380 --> 1:23:42.380]  Well, it was the best positive news we heard all day yesterday
[1:23:42.380 --> 1:23:44.380]  What are you talking about?
[1:23:44.380 --> 1:23:47.380]  Getting together with Saudi Arabia is absolutely fantastic
[1:23:47.380 --> 1:23:50.380]  Michael, I thought you disagreed with me massively
[1:23:50.380 --> 1:23:52.380]  No, no, no, not at all
[1:23:52.380 --> 1:23:57.380]  I've disagreed with you the way you responded yesterday to the gentleman that's been making fun of you
[1:23:57.380 --> 1:24:00.380]  I think that you're going at this totally the wrong way
[1:24:00.380 --> 1:24:03.380]  You need to change the way you look at things and the things you look at change
[1:24:03.380 --> 1:24:05.380]  You've got to act as if nothing happened
[1:24:05.380 --> 1:24:08.380]  You've got to find your happy place like Adam Sandler
[1:24:08.380 --> 1:24:10.380]  You know, remember the movie Happy Gilmore?
[1:24:10.380 --> 1:24:14.380]  And you've got to get together with Steven Crowder and do skits against these guys
[1:24:14.380 --> 1:24:16.380]  And make fun of them
[1:24:16.380 --> 1:24:20.380]  But stop getting angry and screaming and yelling and hurting yourself
[1:24:20.380 --> 1:24:24.380]  You're making yourself sick and we don't want to see you have a heart attack or a stroke
[1:24:24.380 --> 1:24:28.380]  No, I hear you, but I mean, look, they say that I put out a fake Comey clip
[1:24:28.380 --> 1:24:30.380]  I didn't put out a fake Comey clip
[1:24:30.380 --> 1:24:32.380]  No, you didn't and you're absolutely correct
[1:24:32.380 --> 1:24:33.380]  You're right on that
[1:24:33.380 --> 1:24:35.380]  You were absolutely right on everything they did
[1:24:35.380 --> 1:24:37.380]  You've got to stop responding to them
[1:24:37.380 --> 1:24:39.380]  They're trying to get you upset
[1:24:39.380 --> 1:24:41.380]  They're trying to make you look silly
[1:24:41.380 --> 1:24:43.380]  You've got to be strong for us
[1:24:43.380 --> 1:24:45.380]  We need you more than ever
[1:24:45.380 --> 1:24:48.380]  You've got to give them a dose of their own medicine
[1:24:48.380 --> 1:24:49.380]  No, I hear you, but I've always been real
[1:24:49.380 --> 1:24:50.380]  So people get to me, I'll show it
[1:24:50.380 --> 1:24:51.380]  I'm just
[1:24:51.380 --> 1:24:52.380]  No, we appreciate that
[1:24:52.380 --> 1:24:54.380]  We really do, man, listen
[1:24:54.380 --> 1:24:56.380]  My dad was just like, he's so passionate
[1:24:56.380 --> 1:24:57.380]  I am
[1:24:57.380 --> 1:24:59.380]  I get so angry and screaming yelling at people
[1:24:59.380 --> 1:25:01.380]  It gets me nowhere, Alex
[1:25:01.380 --> 1:25:05.380]  But when I give them love and I twist it in a sarcastic way to them
[1:25:05.380 --> 1:25:08.380]  And I make them laugh, they change the way they think
[1:25:08.380 --> 1:25:09.380]  Okay, well, I'm listening
[1:25:09.380 --> 1:25:10.380]  You're making good points
[1:25:10.380 --> 1:25:12.380]  So you think it's smart to go to Saudi Arabia
[1:25:12.380 --> 1:25:14.380]  I think it's a total masterstroke
[1:25:14.380 --> 1:25:17.380]  No US presidents ever done that first or even tenth
[1:25:17.380 --> 1:25:19.380]  I think the trip is going to be perfect
[1:25:19.380 --> 1:25:21.380]  I think all the bullshit
[1:25:21.380 --> 1:25:23.380]  I'm sorry, all the bull that's going on
[1:25:23.380 --> 1:25:25.380]  That they're saying over on the news right now
[1:25:25.380 --> 1:25:27.380]  All the crap that they came up with
[1:25:27.380 --> 1:25:29.380]  The moment he took off in his plane
[1:25:29.380 --> 1:25:30.380]  Everybody knows it's bull
[1:25:30.380 --> 1:25:32.380]  Everyone
[1:25:32.380 --> 1:25:35.380]  Even the people on the reverse side
[1:25:35.380 --> 1:25:39.380]  Listen, we got Soros paying for all these people to be in the streets
[1:25:39.380 --> 1:25:42.380]  They're not getting to these places for free
[1:25:42.380 --> 1:25:45.380]  They're going and they're getting money and financing
[1:25:45.380 --> 1:25:48.380]  We need to start our own way to start raising money
[1:25:48.380 --> 1:25:50.380]  For all of us to go out
[1:25:50.380 --> 1:25:51.380]  Well, let me ask you this
[1:25:51.380 --> 1:25:52.380]  I agree with you
[1:25:52.380 --> 1:25:55.380]  Soros doubled the money he's given to these agitator groups
[1:25:55.380 --> 1:25:57.380]  And if you want to finance groups that expose bad police
[1:25:57.380 --> 1:25:58.380]  More power to you
[1:25:58.380 --> 1:26:01.380]  You want to finance groups that go out and kill police randomly
[1:26:01.380 --> 1:26:02.380]  I'm totally against you
[1:26:02.380 --> 1:26:05.380]  Soros doubled the amount of money for this
[1:26:05.380 --> 1:26:06.380]  As soon as Trump won
[1:26:06.380 --> 1:26:10.380]  They're planning they admit to burn down major cities in July
[1:26:10.380 --> 1:26:12.380]  As their new July 4th
[1:26:12.380 --> 1:26:13.380]  Are we going to pull it up with this?
[1:26:13.380 --> 1:26:14.380]  What do we do?
[1:26:14.380 --> 1:26:16.380]  No, we get the new crowdfunding source together
[1:26:16.380 --> 1:26:17.380]  We start raising money
[1:26:17.380 --> 1:26:20.380]  And we get the bikers for Trump to get out there
[1:26:20.380 --> 1:26:21.380]  We get the guys that support it
[1:26:21.380 --> 1:26:24.380]  We get the guys that want to support financing
[1:26:24.380 --> 1:26:25.380]  Well, I'll say this
[1:26:25.380 --> 1:26:26.380]  I was there while they were beating up women
[1:26:26.380 --> 1:26:29.380]  And I got involved obviously at the inauguration of Trump
[1:26:29.380 --> 1:26:31.380]  Because I couldn't stand anymore fighting back against it
[1:26:31.380 --> 1:26:33.380]  Finally, the bikers did show up and did kick the ass
[1:26:33.380 --> 1:26:35.380]  Of a bunch of communists who ran off
[1:26:35.380 --> 1:26:38.380]  So people could even get in to the inauguration
[1:26:38.380 --> 1:26:40.380]  That the media lied about and said nobody was there
[1:26:40.380 --> 1:26:42.380]  But good points, I appreciate your call
[1:26:42.380 --> 1:26:44.380]  You know, I see somebody disagree and they go to the head of the line
[1:26:44.380 --> 1:26:46.380]  But let's not really cheat to get to the head of the line
[1:26:46.380 --> 1:26:49.380]  I really want to hear from folks that actually disagree with me
[1:26:49.380 --> 1:26:52.380]  So we can actually hear what they're saying
[1:26:52.380 --> 1:26:53.380]  Let's go ahead now
[1:26:53.380 --> 1:26:55.380]  Who should I go to next?
[1:26:55.380 --> 1:26:58.380]  Hmm, there's so many calls here
[1:26:58.380 --> 1:27:02.380]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jeanine in West Palm Beach, Florida
[1:27:02.380 --> 1:27:04.380]  She says Trump is siding with the Sunnis
[1:27:04.380 --> 1:27:05.380]  Jeanine, go ahead
[1:27:05.380 --> 1:27:06.380]  Hi, Alex
[1:27:06.380 --> 1:27:08.380]  Thank you for taking my call
[1:27:08.380 --> 1:27:09.380]  Thank you, go ahead
[1:27:09.380 --> 1:27:11.380]  You know, I'm not sure if it's a good thing or not
[1:27:11.380 --> 1:27:13.380]  I think you had to choose a strategy
[1:27:13.380 --> 1:27:16.380]  And I think choosing the Sunnis is not a bad idea
[1:27:16.380 --> 1:27:18.380]  But it remains to be seen
[1:27:18.380 --> 1:27:20.380]  I don't know, the Saudi Arabians are no angels
[1:27:20.380 --> 1:27:22.380]  They're the dominant Islamic group worldwide
[1:27:22.380 --> 1:27:24.380]  They're the ones partially behind ISIS
[1:27:24.380 --> 1:27:26.380]  But he's already destroyed their force
[1:27:26.380 --> 1:27:28.380]  Kicked them out pretty much as serious
[1:27:28.380 --> 1:27:30.380]  So it's almost like I just kicked your ass
[1:27:30.380 --> 1:27:32.380]  In 120 days, are you ready to capitulate?
[1:27:32.380 --> 1:27:36.380]  Right, but you also have Erdogan, Putin, and Iran
[1:27:36.380 --> 1:27:38.380]  Forming a nice little triangle
[1:27:38.380 --> 1:27:40.380]  So when you look at that triangle
[1:27:40.380 --> 1:27:43.380]  But by comparison to using Saudi Arabia
[1:27:43.380 --> 1:27:45.380]  Strategically, we're giving them a lot of weapons
[1:27:45.380 --> 1:27:47.380]  That can be turned on ISIS that they invade
[1:27:47.380 --> 1:27:50.380]  Saudi Arabians don't want ISIS getting a hold in their country
[1:27:50.380 --> 1:27:52.380]  Because it's just, it's dry timberwood
[1:27:52.380 --> 1:27:54.380]  It wouldn't take much
[1:27:54.380 --> 1:27:55.380]  So they're afraid
[1:27:55.380 --> 1:27:59.380]  And then Saudi Arabia can pull in all the minor countries
[1:27:59.380 --> 1:28:02.380]  Maybe like Egypt, give them a set of balls
[1:28:02.380 --> 1:28:04.380]  And maybe we can get something accomplished there
[1:28:04.380 --> 1:28:09.380]  But I really like that he evoked the images of their past renaissance
[1:28:09.380 --> 1:28:13.380]  Because the Arabs weren't always the way that they are
[1:28:13.380 --> 1:28:15.380]  They weren't always disorganized and chaotic
[1:28:15.380 --> 1:28:17.380]  They were periods of time in history
[1:28:17.380 --> 1:28:19.380]  Where they were leaders
[1:28:19.380 --> 1:28:21.380]  Sure, that's absolutely true
[1:28:21.380 --> 1:28:22.380]  And that's what he's saying
[1:28:22.380 --> 1:28:25.380]  A better world, I've just defeated your ISIS al-Qaeda forces
[1:28:25.380 --> 1:28:28.380]  You better actually clamp down on this or you have no future
[1:28:28.380 --> 1:28:33.380]  And if Trump hadn't already shut down our borders
[1:28:33.380 --> 1:28:35.380]  Kicked these people out, moved against it
[1:28:35.380 --> 1:28:37.380]  Spoken out against it, it would be fake
[1:28:37.380 --> 1:28:40.380]  It's real because he's actually now shown them the teeth
[1:28:40.380 --> 1:28:42.380]  Alright, more great calls straight ahead
[1:28:42.380 --> 1:28:43.380]  Thank you so much, Janine
[1:28:43.380 --> 1:28:48.380]  We're going to talk to Michael and Michelle and Chris and Mark and
[1:28:48.380 --> 1:28:52.380]  Daria and Mark and Alyssa and Lee and others
[1:28:52.380 --> 1:29:18.380]  Straight ahead, I'm Alex Jones, stay with us
[1:29:22.380 --> 1:29:24.380]  Hello workers, your family, your children

[1:29:27.380 --> 1:29:30.380]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment
[1:29:30.380 --> 1:29:32.380]  While themselves doing things that mitigate
[1:29:32.380 --> 1:29:35.380]  Or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves
[1:29:35.380 --> 1:29:37.380]  The general public doesn't
[1:29:37.380 --> 1:29:41.380]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500
[1:29:41.380 --> 1:29:45.380]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean
[1:29:45.380 --> 1:29:47.380]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house
[1:29:47.380 --> 1:29:51.380]  Replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job
[1:29:51.380 --> 1:29:54.380]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today

[1:31:57.380 --> 1:32:01.380]  Not a group you develop living defense for us. It took you over a year to do it.
[1:32:01.380 --> 1:32:02.380]  Why is this so good?
[1:32:02.380 --> 1:32:07.380]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[1:32:07.380 --> 1:32:13.380]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system,
[1:32:13.380 --> 1:32:19.380]  but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body
[1:32:19.380 --> 1:32:25.380]  that lives off a host mechanism. Right now with all the refugees spreading disease around,
[1:32:25.380 --> 1:32:29.380]  we have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all parasites.
[1:32:29.380 --> 1:32:31.380]  Tell us about all the stuff we said. There's so many things that are in it.
[1:32:31.380 --> 1:32:36.380]  You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[1:32:36.380 --> 1:32:39.380]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[1:32:39.380 --> 1:32:42.380]  All right. Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[1:32:42.380 --> 1:32:45.380]  It just came back in yesterday. Living defense, infowarslife.com.
[1:32:45.380 --> 1:32:49.380]  And folks, you can't lose full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[1:32:49.380 --> 1:32:52.380]  And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com.
[1:32:52.380 --> 1:32:57.380]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center. Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[1:33:01.380 --> 1:33:05.380]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:33:05.380 --> 1:33:26.380]  Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[1:33:26.380 --> 1:33:36.380]  All right. Your phone calls are coming up pretty much instantaneously. Thank you for joining us.
[1:33:36.380 --> 1:33:42.380]  Trump has gone into the belly of the beast, Saudi Arabia, where Mecca and the founding
[1:33:42.380 --> 1:33:47.380]  by the Prophet Muhammad started it all. They're the folks that took over.
[1:33:47.380 --> 1:33:56.380]  What's Turkey today and turned Constantinople into Istanbul. And they want to take over the rest of the world.
[1:33:56.380 --> 1:34:01.380]  They've made alliances with the West to sell us all their oil.
[1:34:01.380 --> 1:34:07.380]  And they've made double-sided deals with their own radicals to go out and colonize third-world countries
[1:34:07.380 --> 1:34:12.380]  where there's no Western culture to defend or they can then put her by the sword, who's male,
[1:34:12.380 --> 1:34:15.380]  and then basically take the women back as sex slaves.
[1:34:15.380 --> 1:34:19.380]  That's mainstream news. Our country liberated Libya a few years ago.
[1:34:19.380 --> 1:34:23.380]  And now they're selling women on the slave blocks, loading them on the ships.
[1:34:23.380 --> 1:34:28.380]  Saudi Arabia taught the world, that is, the Muslims that were there, the House of Saud.
[1:34:28.380 --> 1:34:32.380]  They're the famous slavers on the caravans that would rob people and were ruthless
[1:34:32.380 --> 1:34:37.380]  and sold women to slavery. Sex slavery. And so they're the great experts of this.
[1:34:37.380 --> 1:34:43.380]  And so there you see our president there bringing in his wife, a lot of courage, into that nest.
[1:34:43.380 --> 1:34:49.380]  And you can argue, well, it's a genius move. Yeah, but you can get peace out of it and get them to stop funding terrorism.
[1:34:49.380 --> 1:34:55.380]  I guess it is. He's there in their own nest, criticizing their barbarism, criticizing what many of them are funding.
[1:34:55.380 --> 1:35:01.380]  So hopefully they will back off. Hopefully they will stop. We'll see. We'll see.
[1:35:01.380 --> 1:35:11.380]  But right now let's go to... Who's calling from Alberta, Canada?
[1:35:11.380 --> 1:35:16.380]  Okay, yeah, because my screen's a little bit. Then I've got Chris, and I got Mark, and I got Daria,
[1:35:16.380 --> 1:35:23.380]  and I got another Mark, and I got Alyssa, and I've got Lee, and I've got William, and I've got Donnie.
[1:35:23.380 --> 1:35:29.380]  My eyes are as good as they used to be. They're still almost 2020, but it's hard to read over here.
[1:35:29.380 --> 1:35:32.380]  Especially when you're looking at bright lights, and then you try to look at a screen with numbers.
[1:35:32.380 --> 1:35:37.380]  That's my main goals. My eyes are getting where, when I look at bright lights, it's then hard to then read
[1:35:37.380 --> 1:35:43.380]  computer screens that are six, seven feet away, or five feet away. I guess let's go to Daria.
[1:35:43.380 --> 1:35:49.380]  Let's go to Daria in Richmond, Virginia. Thanks for calling. Daria here on the air.
[1:35:49.380 --> 1:35:51.380]  Hi, how are you, Alex? Thanks for calling.
[1:35:51.380 --> 1:35:53.380]  I'm great. Thanks for calling.
[1:35:53.380 --> 1:35:58.380]  Okay, so here's why I think it is. A couple of things I'd say, and one of them is from something that I heard you say yesterday
[1:35:58.380 --> 1:36:03.380]  about how our biggest issue right now is that the socialists are trying to destroy our country,
[1:36:03.380 --> 1:36:10.380]  and the antidote to that is economy and jobs. So Trump being the dealmaker and the businessman
[1:36:10.380 --> 1:36:14.380]  goes to Saudi Arabia to make money and jobs for our country.
[1:36:14.380 --> 1:36:17.380]  You can't really fight Islam, but we don't have a country.
[1:36:17.380 --> 1:36:23.380]  That's right. They're totally full of trillions of dollars of U.S. money from oil,
[1:36:23.380 --> 1:36:26.380]  because they've got the sweet crude, and we've made one side a deal.
[1:36:26.380 --> 1:36:34.380]  They're bringing back hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars in new infrastructure and jobs.
[1:36:34.380 --> 1:36:37.380]  Yeah, so he makes money off of Islam so he can fight Islam.
[1:36:37.380 --> 1:36:41.380]  And then we also have the R of the deal, where he's just a dealmaker and a marketer.
[1:36:41.380 --> 1:36:44.380]  So he kind of frames this better life to them.
[1:36:44.380 --> 1:36:48.380]  He's marketing and selling an anti-Islamic life in the heart of Islam.
[1:36:48.380 --> 1:36:52.380]  I just, I mean, you don't get bigger, you know what, than that. That's pretty amazing.
[1:36:52.380 --> 1:36:56.380]  I'm still your term. I'm still your term. I try to hire you smarter than I am, much smarter.
[1:36:56.380 --> 1:36:59.380]  I'm trying to name this segment when we put it on YouTube and Facebook,
[1:36:59.380 --> 1:37:02.380]  and I was like, Trump challenges Islam from the heart of Islam,
[1:37:02.380 --> 1:37:06.380]  or Trump tries to reform Islam from the heart of Islam,
[1:37:06.380 --> 1:37:09.380]  but give me a headline. Your sound's smarter.
[1:37:09.380 --> 1:37:13.380]  Trump is, what did you just say?
[1:37:13.380 --> 1:37:21.380]  I forgot what I just said. Well, I mean, he's selling an anti-Islamic life in the heart of Islam.
[1:37:21.380 --> 1:37:23.380]  You just don't get any more money than that.
[1:37:23.380 --> 1:37:26.380]  That's right. Trump goes to the heart of Islam to free the slaves.
[1:37:26.380 --> 1:37:30.380]  Yeah, you bring the most beautiful, classy, elegant women.
[1:37:30.380 --> 1:37:33.380]  You show the best life, what life can be if you don't have Islam.
[1:37:33.380 --> 1:37:35.380]  I mean, I think it's a great, it's awesome.
[1:37:35.380 --> 1:37:39.380]  By the way, they admit the women are, like, reportedly on fire,
[1:37:39.380 --> 1:37:42.380]  wanting to know about Melania and wanting to know about all the rest of them.
[1:37:42.380 --> 1:37:47.380]  They are freaking out right now about seeing these empowered, beautiful women.
[1:37:47.380 --> 1:37:51.380]  Yeah, and then the last thing I would say is, short of giving an altar call,
[1:37:51.380 --> 1:37:57.380]  he pretty much, he basically said, touch the hem of our, you know, God-fearing garment,
[1:37:57.380 --> 1:38:00.380]  and turn from your wickedness, oh, we're going to beat your ass.
[1:38:00.380 --> 1:38:03.380]  So, I mean, he's an altar call, really. I mean, he couldn't do much more than that,
[1:38:03.380 --> 1:38:05.380]  and he did it in a way where he left him with a dignity.
[1:38:05.380 --> 1:38:09.380]  You know, he didn't say your God calls for the terror and all this,
[1:38:09.380 --> 1:38:11.380]  but he said, if you do that, you're condemned.
[1:38:11.380 --> 1:38:13.380]  So, I mean, you can't do much more than that.
[1:38:13.380 --> 1:38:15.380]  I think mostly because he's a salesman.
[1:38:15.380 --> 1:38:17.380]  If he's going to, is there a deal he can make?
[1:38:17.380 --> 1:38:19.380]  He's going to do it, and first off, make money.
[1:38:19.380 --> 1:38:20.380]  He's going to find a way to make money.
[1:38:20.380 --> 1:38:22.380]  Well, we have a Daria that works here that's super smart,
[1:38:22.380 --> 1:38:24.380]  and we have another Daria calling in who's smarter than I am.
[1:38:24.380 --> 1:38:28.380]  So, I guess Daria, if you have the first name Daria, these are super smart.
[1:38:28.380 --> 1:38:31.380]  Thank you. But, you know, we listen to you almost every day,
[1:38:31.380 --> 1:38:35.380]  and I have loved following you with this whole Trump journey and seeing you change your mind.
[1:38:35.380 --> 1:38:37.380]  I was like, come on out. You're going to like Trump.
[1:38:37.380 --> 1:38:39.380]  I know you are, and then when you did it, it was awesome.
[1:38:39.380 --> 1:38:40.380]  So, we listen to you almost every day.
[1:38:40.380 --> 1:38:42.380]  Well, thank you, and thanks for the support.
[1:38:42.380 --> 1:38:45.380]  Yeah, no, look, I mean, when I'm wrong about something, I'll change my mind.
[1:38:45.380 --> 1:38:47.380]  But you know Trump by his enemies.
[1:38:47.380 --> 1:38:53.380]  He's so attacked by the globalists who are the most scientifically anti-human, evil people there are.
[1:38:53.380 --> 1:38:55.380]  You know he's good because he's challenging that.
[1:38:55.380 --> 1:38:58.380]  Will he make mistakes? Absolutely.
[1:38:58.380 --> 1:39:02.380]  But if he's going to use them to help us, he doesn't have a problem with who he uses.
[1:39:02.380 --> 1:39:03.380]  Absolutely.
[1:39:03.380 --> 1:39:04.380]  Sure, sure.
[1:39:04.380 --> 1:39:07.380]  Well, that's one reason the elite hate him so much is he can change his mind.
[1:39:07.380 --> 1:39:09.380]  Thanks for the call. Great points, Daria.
[1:39:09.380 --> 1:39:13.380]  Okay, who's up next here? We've got Alyssa and Lee and William and Donnie.
[1:39:13.380 --> 1:39:17.380]  And we've got Michael's been holding a while and Chris and Mark.
[1:39:17.380 --> 1:39:21.380]  Let's start here with the callers, Mark, Chris and Mark and others.
[1:39:21.380 --> 1:39:25.380]  Let's go ahead and talk to Michael. You're on the year. Go ahead.
[1:39:25.380 --> 1:39:27.380]  Hey, Alex. Good day to you, sir.
[1:39:27.380 --> 1:39:28.380]  Thank you.
[1:39:28.380 --> 1:39:32.380]  I've been an infall lawyer listening to your show now four and a half years.
[1:39:32.380 --> 1:39:35.380]  Using your products now for about the same time. They're all great.
[1:39:35.380 --> 1:39:37.380]  Thank you. We couldn't do it without you.
[1:39:37.380 --> 1:39:39.380]  I'll be here if it wasn't for you supporting us. Thank you.
[1:39:39.380 --> 1:39:41.380]  I'll try to support you as much as I can.
[1:39:41.380 --> 1:39:42.380]  Thank you.
[1:39:42.380 --> 1:39:47.380]  As far as the Saudi Arabia situation goes, I agree with the fact that he had to get out
[1:39:47.380 --> 1:39:53.380]  of the United States and look presidential overseas to the leaders of Saudi Arabia.
[1:39:53.380 --> 1:39:57.380]  And I think he's done that. The fact that there's no headscarves on a bank.
[1:39:57.380 --> 1:39:59.380]  I mean, that's pretty.
[1:39:59.380 --> 1:40:02.380]  Oh, yeah, that's another thing. I didn't even think of the big one.
[1:40:02.380 --> 1:40:09.380]  Don't the Democrats, didn't they have their women wear like little headscarves when they went?
[1:40:09.380 --> 1:40:14.380]  Yes, they did. Hillary Clinton did as well. And so did Michelle.
[1:40:14.380 --> 1:40:16.380]  So no headscarves.
[1:40:16.380 --> 1:40:18.380]  Melania or Ivanka, which is pretty telling.
[1:40:18.380 --> 1:40:23.380]  And the fact that he mentioned terror 31 times when Obama said nothing,
[1:40:23.380 --> 1:40:26.380]  I think shows cahony.
[1:40:26.380 --> 1:40:28.380]  You know, I hadn't even clicked to that.
[1:40:28.380 --> 1:40:32.380]  I was just reading a Trump tweet during the break where he was pointing that out,
[1:40:32.380 --> 1:40:33.380]  but it didn't have an image.
[1:40:33.380 --> 1:40:40.380]  And I just remembered every time I saw Hillary or Samantha Powers or any other woman in the Middle East
[1:40:40.380 --> 1:40:44.380]  going to one of these Orthodox countries like Saudi Arabia,
[1:40:44.380 --> 1:40:49.380]  they were wearing a hijab, basically a scarf covering the sides of their faces.
[1:40:49.380 --> 1:40:52.380]  And they're not doing it here.
[1:40:52.380 --> 1:40:55.380]  That is a revolutionary act that no one's even pointed out.
[1:40:55.380 --> 1:41:00.380]  That's amazing. No wonder she's all the rage there right now. Ivanka Trump.
[1:41:00.380 --> 1:41:04.380]  Wow. And of course, Melania Trump. I'm going to look that up.
[1:41:04.380 --> 1:41:09.380]  I agree that he had to get out because of the optics right now in the United States.
[1:41:09.380 --> 1:41:14.380]  And even here in Canada, make no mistake about it. This is a civil war.
[1:41:14.380 --> 1:41:19.380]  I was at Berkeley April 15th of this year for the Berkeley 2.0 riots.
[1:41:19.380 --> 1:41:23.380]  And I have never seen such division in a population in my life.
[1:41:23.380 --> 1:41:28.380]  I've also not met so many great people, so many great patriots in my life.
[1:41:28.380 --> 1:41:34.380]  And all it's going to take is one of the, basically, riots.
[1:41:34.380 --> 1:41:40.380]  And someone gets bad or shot, and that's going to be the shot heard around the world 2.0.
[1:41:40.380 --> 1:41:43.380]  So he had to leave.
[1:41:43.380 --> 1:41:49.380]  Well, look, all I want is for the government not to be anti-Christian, anti-second of an anti-free market,
[1:41:49.380 --> 1:41:52.380]  try to brainwash our kids and turn them against their parents.
[1:41:52.380 --> 1:41:55.380]  I mean, that's what's going on here. That's why I'm fundamentally against the Democrats
[1:41:55.380 --> 1:41:58.380]  and the Republican establishment because they're carrying out the social engineering.
[1:41:58.380 --> 1:42:03.380]  And to be clear, I saw Melania and Ivanka Trump getting off the airplanes,
[1:42:03.380 --> 1:42:07.380]  walking around not wearing scarves or hijabs or burkas.
[1:42:07.380 --> 1:42:11.380]  And then I'm being told that Trump actually criticized, I think, as a joke, maybe,
[1:42:11.380 --> 1:42:17.380]  because I've seen Obama's wife and I've seen Hillary wear hijabs there.
[1:42:17.380 --> 1:42:23.380]  But Trump tweeted, oh, I can't believe he didn't wear hijabs to Michelle Obama.
[1:42:23.380 --> 1:42:26.380]  So maybe it's sarcasm because I'm looking at his tweet.
[1:42:26.380 --> 1:42:29.380]  We'll try to find out during the break. Thank you so much, Michael.
[1:42:29.380 --> 1:42:32.380]  Now, when I come back, I'm going boom, boom, boom to your great calls.
[1:42:32.380 --> 1:42:37.380]  Chris in Cincinnati, Mark in Texas, Mark in Rhode Island, Alyssa in Oregon,
[1:42:37.380 --> 1:42:40.380]  Lee in Washington, William in Minnesota, and Donnie in Oregon.
[1:42:40.380 --> 1:42:44.380]  We're going to all those callers, at least those, straight ahead.
[1:42:44.380 --> 1:42:49.380]  We're willing. I'll be back tomorrow live with David Knight and others hosting with me.
[1:42:49.380 --> 1:42:52.380]  11 a.m. Central for the weekday transmission of InfoWars,
[1:42:52.380 --> 1:42:57.380]  that for whatever reason has the entire MSM having convulsions over us.
[1:42:57.380 --> 1:43:00.380]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling super blue fluoride toothpaste
[1:43:00.380 --> 1:43:05.380]  is now back in stock at infowarstore.com. Research across the board is clear.
[1:43:05.380 --> 1:43:08.380]  When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream,
[1:43:08.380 --> 1:43:10.380]  and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[1:43:10.380 --> 1:43:14.380]  That's why the Last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns
[1:43:14.380 --> 1:43:17.380]  that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[1:43:17.380 --> 1:43:20.380]  Super blue fluoride-free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[1:43:20.380 --> 1:43:24.380]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine, some of the bad halogen fluoride.
[1:43:24.380 --> 1:43:28.380]  Super blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times
[1:43:28.380 --> 1:43:31.380]  to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[1:43:31.380 --> 1:43:35.380]  Just some of the ingredients in super blue, chosen by our dental experts include
[1:43:35.380 --> 1:43:39.380]  xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver, and more.
[1:43:39.380 --> 1:43:43.380]  Due to requests from listeners who found that spearmint was a little bit too strong
[1:43:43.380 --> 1:43:46.380]  for some of their children, we have created the new bubblegum flavored super blue
[1:43:46.380 --> 1:43:49.380]  that is spearmint-free. Learn more about the new bubblegum flavored
[1:43:49.380 --> 1:43:52.380]  super blue toothpaste and more at infowarslife.com
[1:43:52.380 --> 1:43:56.380]  and support the info war while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[1:44:00.380 --> 1:44:03.380]  Let's go to David in Florida. David in Florida, you're on the air.
[1:44:03.380 --> 1:44:08.380]  Great. Hey, thank you so much. Listen, I have bought your product
[1:44:08.380 --> 1:44:11.380]  and I got to say they're amazing. Anyone who's on the fence, buy it
[1:44:11.380 --> 1:44:16.380]  because I've got caveman, superman of vitality, secret swell, vitamin
[1:44:16.380 --> 1:44:20.380]  and infusion, I've got the body armor. Wow, thank you.
[1:44:20.380 --> 1:44:23.380]  You're the type of listener that makes it all possible. Which dude for surgical
[1:44:23.380 --> 1:44:27.380]  does you like best? I really like the vitamin mineral fusion to be honest.
[1:44:27.380 --> 1:44:31.380]  That's amazing. That's really incredible. I drank it in the morning and I swear to you,
[1:44:31.380 --> 1:44:35.380]  I felt incredible. I haven't felt sweet. My morning was fantastic
[1:44:35.380 --> 1:44:40.380]  and I love you guys. I love the info wars crew and I just want to, yeah,
[1:44:40.380 --> 1:44:44.380]  I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence,
[1:44:44.380 --> 1:44:48.380]  just buy it. We'll love it. I'm telling you, I've never bought a bad product.
[1:44:48.380 --> 1:44:53.380]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at infowarslife.com.
[1:44:53.380 --> 1:45:06.380]  Then win infowarslife.com.
[1:45:23.380 --> 1:45:27.380]  This is the first time I've ever seen a product that's made of plastic material
[1:45:27.380 --> 1:45:31.380]  ever created called ultra high molecular weight polyethylene.
[1:45:31.380 --> 1:45:35.380]  Defender armor is also super compact and lightweight. There's a reason the
[1:45:35.380 --> 1:45:39.380]  department of defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced
[1:45:39.380 --> 1:45:43.380]  lightweight armor. It works. Defender body armor is made right here in America
[1:45:43.380 --> 1:45:47.380]  and has received the highest level ballistic resistance certification from an authorized
[1:45:47.380 --> 1:45:51.380]  NIJ ballistic laboratory. Defender body armor is now available through
[1:45:51.380 --> 1:45:55.380]  your family and finance the info war against the globalist. All at the same time.
[1:45:55.380 --> 1:46:01.380]  A total 360 win. Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out
[1:46:01.380 --> 1:46:05.380]  three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products
[1:46:05.380 --> 1:46:09.380]  and fund the info war. A 360 win. Number one, when you choose
[1:46:09.380 --> 1:46:13.380]  auto ship before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order
[1:46:13.380 --> 1:46:17.380]  at infowarsore.com. Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock
[1:46:17.380 --> 1:46:21.380]  when you sign up for auto ship because we hold back a surplus for auto ship customers.
[1:46:21.380 --> 1:46:25.380]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders
[1:46:25.380 --> 1:46:29.380]  above $50. Listeners have been requesting this for years
[1:46:29.380 --> 1:46:33.380]  because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[1:46:33.380 --> 1:46:37.380]  Just go to infowarsore.com, select your favorite product or products, click
[1:46:37.380 --> 1:46:41.380]  on auto ship and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[1:46:41.380 --> 1:46:45.380]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win and with the new auto ship feature
[1:46:45.380 --> 1:46:49.380]  at infowarsore.com, this is a sure win. 10% off on auto ship.
[1:46:49.380 --> 1:46:53.380]  Win, win, win at infowarsore.com. Free shipping on orders above $50.
[1:46:53.380 --> 1:46:57.380]  And all out of stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for auto ship.
[1:47:01.380 --> 1:47:05.380]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:05.380 --> 1:47:09.380]  The globalist's great error is to believe that as they collapse
[1:47:09.380 --> 1:47:13.380]  humanity, they end up on top. The truth is
[1:47:13.380 --> 1:47:17.380]  humanity is coming down fast but we're miles above them
[1:47:17.380 --> 1:47:21.380]  on our journey to hell.
[1:47:21.380 --> 1:47:25.380]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:25.380 --> 1:47:29.380]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:29.380 --> 1:47:33.380]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:33.380 --> 1:47:37.380]  I do your stuff to warm and love you.
[1:47:37.380 --> 1:47:41.380]  You know, there's so much news I want to
[1:47:41.380 --> 1:47:45.380]  get to that isn't just Trump related. But Trump is like a
[1:47:45.380 --> 1:47:49.380]  case point example of nationalism and an attempt to have a president actually
[1:47:49.380 --> 1:47:53.380]  be the president and have your own country run your own country.
[1:47:53.380 --> 1:47:57.380]  So I don't give Trump any leeway, quite frankly, in fact I hold him to a higher standard.
[1:47:57.380 --> 1:48:01.380]  He's just done so many good things that I
[1:48:01.380 --> 1:48:05.380]  am still having an open mind despite the fact
[1:48:05.380 --> 1:48:09.380]  that he's done some things that I see as bad as well.
[1:48:09.380 --> 1:48:13.380]  But really isn't it about what we do politically, what we do culturally,
[1:48:13.380 --> 1:48:17.380]  what we support, what we promote? That's really where all this
[1:48:17.380 --> 1:48:21.380]  stands right now. And you look at the hysterical globalist elite
[1:48:21.380 --> 1:48:25.380]  that we know are the worst people on earth with the worst track records
[1:48:25.380 --> 1:48:29.380]  and the worst admissions of their plan, their anti-human plan, their greedy
[1:48:29.380 --> 1:48:33.380]  evil plan there against Trump. So what does that tell you?
[1:48:37.380 --> 1:48:41.380]  It tells you we're living in very, very interesting times.
[1:48:41.380 --> 1:48:45.380]  Briefly, we're listeners supported. Please spread the articles, the videos, the news.
[1:48:45.380 --> 1:48:49.380]  We're in information war. They believe they're computers and censorship systems can block
[1:48:49.380 --> 1:48:53.380]  us. They thought they could block the Trump election. They failed. They're panicking now.
[1:48:53.380 --> 1:48:57.380]  They're doubling down. It's an act of total resistance against tyranny
[1:48:57.380 --> 1:49:01.380]  and an act of victory to spread info wars.com stories and videos.
[1:49:01.380 --> 1:49:05.380]  And also check out infowarstore.com where we have the highest quality organic
[1:49:05.380 --> 1:49:09.380]  non-gmo heirloom seeds to plant this summer.
[1:49:09.380 --> 1:49:13.380]  We have the very best non-gmo
[1:49:13.380 --> 1:49:17.380]  organic fluoride free iodine and of course
[1:49:17.380 --> 1:49:21.380]  loyal silver toothpaste, super blue and
[1:49:21.380 --> 1:49:25.380]  a lot of other great products at infowarstore.com. So again, thank you all for your support. You make the broadcast
[1:49:25.380 --> 1:49:29.380]  possible. Chris N. Cincinnati, Ohio, you're on the air. Thanks for calling.
[1:49:31.380 --> 1:49:35.380]  Thanks for taking my call. I'm a huge fan of you in the show
[1:49:35.380 --> 1:49:39.380]  and everyone there at info wars, you guys are true patriots.
[1:49:39.380 --> 1:49:43.380]  They really appreciate you. Thank you, sir.
[1:49:43.380 --> 1:49:47.380]  But yeah, my question is in regards to Trump,
[1:49:47.380 --> 1:49:51.380]  he has all of these enemies closing in on him.
[1:49:51.380 --> 1:49:55.380]  They're surrounding him. He's got the globalists, the establishment,
[1:49:55.380 --> 1:49:59.380]  you know, the Illuminati, George Soros, North Korea,
[1:49:59.380 --> 1:50:03.380]  Syria, Russia, you know, all these enemies closing in on him.
[1:50:03.380 --> 1:50:07.380]  Where does Trump go from here? You know, what's his next step?
[1:50:07.380 --> 1:50:11.380]  In fact, I was thinking during the break
[1:50:11.380 --> 1:50:15.380]  I was in the bathroom. I was thinking, am I right about supporting
[1:50:15.380 --> 1:50:19.380]  Trump and my brain just went, of course you are so far
[1:50:19.380 --> 1:50:23.380]  whether he's a good guy or bad guy is clear. He's a good guy. He's not
[1:50:23.380 --> 1:50:27.380]  perfect. The whole evil systems against him, I basically just said that
[1:50:27.380 --> 1:50:31.380]  and they're trying to destroy him and they're not stopping. So what
[1:50:31.380 --> 1:50:35.380]  do we do to get people to understand that? What is it about Trump
[1:50:35.380 --> 1:50:39.380]  that the elite hate so much? That's the answer. What is it about
[1:50:39.380 --> 1:50:43.380]  info wars? I'm not perfect far from it. What is it about this broadcast they
[1:50:43.380 --> 1:50:47.380]  hate? It's not scripted. You can call in. We have all these
[1:50:47.380 --> 1:50:51.380]  guests. We call them out on lies. We're not out to get people. What they hate
[1:50:51.380 --> 1:50:55.380]  is a real free open discussion, my friend.
[1:50:55.380 --> 1:50:59.380]  I hear you on that.
[1:50:59.380 --> 1:51:03.380]  Good old people on the left.
[1:51:03.380 --> 1:51:07.380]  They love just closing in.
[1:51:07.380 --> 1:51:11.380]  Whenever we try and go into discussion with them, they just go back to the
[1:51:11.380 --> 1:51:15.380]  typical one-liners that they get from
[1:51:15.380 --> 1:51:19.380]  because they're followers. If you look at the domesticated, physically
[1:51:19.380 --> 1:51:23.380]  weak liberal on average, they're not a liberal. These are domesticated
[1:51:23.380 --> 1:51:27.380]  fools and they're real enemy. The globalist real enemy is a classical liberal
[1:51:27.380 --> 1:51:31.380]  of Thomas Jefferson. So they pose as liberals
[1:51:31.380 --> 1:51:35.380]  so they can target their main enemy and control the renaissance. See
[1:51:35.380 --> 1:51:39.380]  Trump invoked true liberalism. The renaissance opened freedom. They don't want freedom.
[1:51:39.380 --> 1:51:43.380]  They want total control. Thank you Chris. Great point. Mark in the great state of Texas
[1:51:43.380 --> 1:51:47.380]  Mark, thanks for holding her on the air.
[1:51:47.380 --> 1:51:51.380]  Great to be on air. We love you all, Alex. A big thing that
[1:51:51.380 --> 1:51:55.380]  Trump said it was the science. The big things in
[1:51:55.380 --> 1:51:59.380]  science that came out of that area where the Bible came from, the birthplace of it
[1:51:59.380 --> 1:52:03.380]  and the Bible wants to give its key in that
[1:52:03.380 --> 1:52:07.380]  Hebrew section, the chapter 9, 14-17
[1:52:07.380 --> 1:52:11.380]  regarding, I guess, teaching each of us.
[1:52:11.380 --> 1:52:15.380]  We're kind of requesting the IWARS listeners
[1:52:15.380 --> 1:52:19.380]  get that info as the Bible speaks for itself
[1:52:19.380 --> 1:52:23.380]  in those verses, chapter 9, Hebrews 14-17. The people parents
[1:52:23.380 --> 1:52:27.380]  for lack of knowledge. I mean, the Bible, if you don't know, the Bible
[1:52:27.380 --> 1:52:31.380]  in business, in relationships, in life is the keys to everything. Not what preachers
[1:52:31.380 --> 1:52:35.380]  distort out of the Bible, but the Bible itself, it is the Holy Land. And notice
[1:52:35.380 --> 1:52:39.380]  thousands of years later, the whole future of the world is still
[1:52:39.380 --> 1:52:43.380]  being decided by the Holy Land and then the people who got the
[1:52:43.380 --> 1:52:47.380]  knowledge of the Holy Land from afar with the New Jerusalem,
[1:52:47.380 --> 1:52:51.380]  the New Atlantis. It's very complex. God bless you, great point. Wow, what
[1:52:51.380 --> 1:52:55.380]  amazing callers. Mark in Rockway, New Jersey. You're on the
[1:52:55.380 --> 1:52:59.380]  ear. Go ahead. Hey, Alex, can you hear me?
[1:52:59.380 --> 1:53:03.380]  I can, despite your radio being up, but that's okay. Go ahead. Sorry, I just
[1:53:03.380 --> 1:53:07.380]  turned it off. Anyway, I've been willing to talk to you for a while. I'm sorry to talk about something
[1:53:07.380 --> 1:53:11.380]  Arabian thing, but I wanted to bring up someone named Dmitri Alberpovich.
[1:53:11.380 --> 1:53:15.380]  He is on the Atlantic Council, which is sort of like a wannabe
[1:53:15.380 --> 1:53:19.380]  Bilderberg group, and it's also the CEO of CrowdStrike, the only
[1:53:19.380 --> 1:53:23.380]  people that were allowed to actually look at the DMC servers. This guy is
[1:53:23.380 --> 1:53:27.380]  a total globalist show, and I try listening to your show when I can, but I don't
[1:53:27.380 --> 1:53:31.380]  think that I've heard you brought him up. No, I'm aware of CrowdStrike.
[1:53:31.380 --> 1:53:35.380]  I'm aware of the Reddit being edited. I'm aware a lot of that stuff going on, but yet
[1:53:35.380 --> 1:53:39.380]  it's a great point. Dmitri Alberpovich
[1:53:39.380 --> 1:53:43.380]  specifically used to work from a cafe about six or seven years ago,
[1:53:43.380 --> 1:53:47.380]  the big security firm. However, he seems to be a total sellout to the
[1:53:47.380 --> 1:53:51.380]  globalist agenda. He's written multiple articles about how nationalism is a danger,
[1:53:51.380 --> 1:53:55.380]  and he was one of the only people that got to look at the DMC servers.
[1:53:55.380 --> 1:53:59.380]  I'd like to see you guys look into that bit more. Also, real quick, also the
[1:53:59.380 --> 1:54:03.380]  Podesta Manafort thing. About two weeks ago, the Podesta group
[1:54:03.380 --> 1:54:07.380]  like Flynn had to do with Turkey just unveiled that they've actually been
[1:54:07.380 --> 1:54:11.380]  a lobbying group for the Ukraine from 2012 to
[1:54:11.380 --> 1:54:15.380]  2014 while they had 30 meetings at Hillary State
[1:54:15.380 --> 1:54:19.380]  Department. I thought that was pretty important also.
[1:54:19.380 --> 1:54:23.380]  Brother, we can spend two hours on what you just raised. It's all totally on target.
[1:54:23.380 --> 1:54:27.380]  Everybody should look into it immediately. God bless you. Alright, let's go to
[1:54:27.380 --> 1:54:31.380]  Alyssa in Oregon. Alyssa, thanks for holding her on the ear.
[1:54:31.380 --> 1:54:35.380]  Thank you for taking my call.
[1:54:35.380 --> 1:54:39.380]  I'm at Saudi Arabia, and I noticed
[1:54:39.380 --> 1:54:43.380]  that there's a little bit of an emphasis in the train about this.
[1:54:43.380 --> 1:54:47.380]  Some people were willing to try to do this.
[1:54:47.380 --> 1:54:51.380]  Me, I'm kind of cautiously optimistic about it, and then I noticed
[1:54:51.380 --> 1:54:55.380]  people like Mike Sertovich. I love Sertovich, but I have to disagree with
[1:54:55.380 --> 1:54:59.380]  him on this. He seems like he was pretty disappointed with the way
[1:54:59.380 --> 1:55:03.380]  Trump carried himself in Syria. I mean, sorry, Saudi Arabia.
[1:55:03.380 --> 1:55:07.380]  I can see Sertovich's perspective, but if it
[1:55:07.380 --> 1:55:11.380]  ends up working, if the peace deal works, if we can get Al-Qaeda and Issa shut down,
[1:55:11.380 --> 1:55:15.380]  if Saudi Arabia backs down because Trump goes and gives them an ultimatum, then it's a
[1:55:15.380 --> 1:55:19.380]  victory. So I think time is going to tell. Thanks for the call. Your phone's breaking up.
[1:55:19.380 --> 1:55:23.380]  Call me back tomorrow, weekday show. Let's go to William in Minnesota.
[1:55:23.380 --> 1:55:27.380]  William, you're on the ear. Go ahead. Thanks for having me.
[1:55:27.380 --> 1:55:31.380]  I support Trump, but I think when he came on scene, there's a good sign of hope
[1:55:31.380 --> 1:55:35.380]  for all of us. Well, he looked like a great leader going into that high of a craziness
[1:55:35.380 --> 1:55:39.380]  and surrounded all the Muslim leaders. I mean, Obama didn't do stuff like that.
[1:55:39.380 --> 1:55:43.380]  He didn't get deal signed day one. I mean, whatever Trump did, he was
[1:55:43.380 --> 1:55:47.380]  I mean, let me tell you, the Saudis look scared of Trump. Again, the globalists
[1:55:47.380 --> 1:55:51.380]  are scared. Why is that? That's the question. That is the question.
[1:55:51.380 --> 1:55:55.380]  I do wonder about Kushner being there with him on the trip in Ivanka.
[1:55:55.380 --> 1:55:59.380]  I know you brought up questions with them and I feel like Kushner might be
[1:55:59.380 --> 1:56:03.380]  having a heavier hand on his foreign policy than we know of.
[1:56:03.380 --> 1:56:07.380]  Well, I know this. Kushner is a main person of interest. He met with the Russian
[1:56:07.380 --> 1:56:11.380]  ambassador. It's all going to come out and that's his biggest weakness as his family.
[1:56:11.380 --> 1:56:15.380]  It's also one of his greatest strengths. I don't think Kushner's a bad guy.
[1:56:15.380 --> 1:56:19.380]  It's just that reportedly they didn't they told investigators
[1:56:19.380 --> 1:56:23.380]  he hadn't met with him. So now they've got people reportedly lying to the
[1:56:23.380 --> 1:56:27.380]  FBI and that's not a good deal. Trump should cut him loose.
[1:56:27.380 --> 1:56:31.380]  Kushner's daddy's in prison. The whole thing's a big, you know, it's not a pretty
[1:56:31.380 --> 1:56:35.380]  situation. I appreciate your call, brother. I'm out of time. I got Donnie and Lee.
[1:56:35.380 --> 1:56:39.380]  I promise to get everybody. Let's try to cram them in. Lee in Washington, you're on the year.
[1:56:39.380 --> 1:56:43.380]  Go ahead. Hey, Alex Jones. I've been waiting a long
[1:56:43.380 --> 1:56:47.380]  time to talk to you. Anyways, I just wanted to
[1:56:47.380 --> 1:56:51.380]  say, I remember back in the day, White
[1:56:51.380 --> 1:56:55.380]  2K, the Bill Cooper incident and you smoking
[1:56:55.380 --> 1:56:59.380]  DMT with Joe Rogan. Now you lost your kids and I'm so happy about that.
[1:56:59.380 --> 1:57:03.380]  If I ever seen you in real life, I would smack this shit out of you.
[1:57:03.380 --> 1:57:07.380]  Delay that because we can't have cussing. I've never taken DMT
[1:57:07.380 --> 1:57:11.380]  and I have not lost my children and everything you see in the
[1:57:11.380 --> 1:57:15.380]  media is pure bull. You see Colbert saying stuff that's not true
[1:57:15.380 --> 1:57:19.380]  and that's just that I guess won't limit that haters. I don't have time to get to Donnie
[1:57:19.380 --> 1:57:23.380]  and Oregon. I apologize to Donnie, but we went to Lee and
[1:57:23.380 --> 1:57:27.380]  Lee, we care about you. We pray that you get better and we care about you.
[1:57:27.380 --> 1:57:31.380]  Now, speaking of that, tomorrow, 11 a.m. Central
[1:57:31.380 --> 1:57:35.380]  Standard Time, we will be live broadcasting worldwide
[1:57:35.380 --> 1:57:39.380]  with the weekday transmission, infowars.com, forward slash show.
