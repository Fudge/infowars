[00:00.000 --> 00:21.280]  Rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty, you're listening to the Alex Jones
[00:21.280 --> 00:45.720]  show. The quickening, the acceleration towards something like a singularity is undeniably
[00:45.720 --> 00:56.520]  apparent right now. The dehumanization, the fall of our species and the rest of life on
[00:56.520 --> 01:01.840]  this planet is evident every day in the numbers, the facts, the statistics, the studies that
[01:01.840 --> 01:12.960]  are coming in. And there is an organized architectural evil pushing the entire program. I say this
[01:12.960 --> 01:19.000]  every day because it's so true. Every day, every week, the news gets more insane, more
[01:19.000 --> 01:22.680]  out in the open. I'm going to do my very best today to cover all of this because I've got
[01:22.680 --> 01:29.760]  to. I have a stack of news without even looking for it, a massive increased lies, deception,
[01:29.760 --> 01:40.120]  censorship in the press, a wanton desire, a hardcore passion to be dishonorable and
[01:40.120 --> 01:49.080]  to deceive the American people. Uncriminal energy. At the same time, we have Hillary
[01:49.080 --> 01:54.280]  Clinton clearly crashing and burning, having a four and a half minute coughing fit of
[01:54.280 --> 01:59.560]  a five minute speech. NBC News said she almost had to cut it short. No, I know her speeches.
[01:59.560 --> 02:05.280]  They're normally 10 minutes long. She cut it off. She had to end the speech. I have
[02:05.280 --> 02:09.320]  one of the writers this week and asked me, well, how do you know? And I said, you can
[02:09.320 --> 02:13.240]  see she ends the speech. We're making the call. She had to end speech. The rest of
[02:13.240 --> 02:18.560]  media said she almost had to. The point is, is she's having conniption fits. Then she's
[02:18.560 --> 02:25.640]  on the airplane doing her first semi-press conference with a bunch of fawning. In fact,
[02:25.640 --> 02:29.960]  I saw this last night and I thought to myself, that looks like a bunch of teenage girls that
[02:29.960 --> 02:34.320]  are seeing some celebrity. And the media even made the point that they look like they're
[02:34.320 --> 02:41.720]  a bunch of teenage girls at some type of, you know, pop rock concert. Just fawning. Even
[02:41.720 --> 02:46.000]  the media admits, oh, she has a coterie of women that follow her around and admit they're
[02:46.000 --> 02:51.120]  distorting everything and they're proud of it. Cause she's a woman. Yeah. Throw all the
[02:51.120 --> 02:55.240]  basic conventions out, be completely corrupt, lie to everybody, cover everything up, but
[02:55.240 --> 03:02.120]  it's okay cause it's cutesy cause she's an old, creepy, war mongering kingpin, mafioso
[03:02.120 --> 03:07.280]  woman who's been in the CIA since she was 19 years old. And that's all been declassified.
[03:07.280 --> 03:12.280]  It's all come out just like Anderson Cooper, Obama, all these people. When I say CIA, they're
[03:12.280 --> 03:20.120]  worse than that. They are foundation operatives put in the CIA. They are Carnegie Endowment.
[03:20.120 --> 03:25.240]  They are Ford Foundation. They are the enemy. They are the globalist. They are the offshore
[03:25.240 --> 03:35.920]  banks. They are the plague. They're not collaborators cause they were never Americans. George Soros
[03:35.920 --> 03:44.200]  is just one of their captains. And yes, there are shadowy generals involved. Unbelievable
[03:44.200 --> 03:49.080]  news in Europe. After the huge Briggs at referendum, the new British prime minister is moving to
[03:49.080 --> 03:55.200]  totally open their borders. Nigel Farage said, I stepped down to give you guys a chance to
[03:55.200 --> 03:59.040]  do what the British people wanted. I'm getting ready to come back after you. That's what
[03:59.040 --> 04:02.360]  he told me privately. I said, well, is that a secret? I should ask what was on the show
[04:02.360 --> 04:07.360]  last week. And he said, no, but I never got to those questions on air, but he told me
[04:07.360 --> 04:14.200]  over over dinner and a drink at the RNC. I'll tell the RNC having dinner that he's just
[04:14.200 --> 04:18.320]  giving them a shot and that he wants and hopes that the government does the right thing
[04:18.320 --> 04:22.240]  and follows the wish of the people. But he said, the horse is ready. And the minute they
[04:22.240 --> 04:26.160]  back off, he's getting back in the arena, which get ready, you're going to see it happen
[04:26.160 --> 04:32.400]  very, very soon. I would look for him to run for, to get back into the UK parliament and
[04:32.400 --> 04:38.440]  run for prime minister and end up saving the UK. Awesome. I mean, I wish they would have
[04:38.440 --> 04:42.920]  done the right thing, but watch for Nigel Farage to get saddled up on his biggest warhorse
[04:42.920 --> 04:47.840]  now. Ladies and gentlemen, there is so much to cover. My head is spinning. We're going
[04:47.840 --> 04:55.960]  to get to all of it today. Give the water to rise over Bear Creek, which is a American
[04:55.960 --> 05:00.040]  file way of saying of the hair doesn't lift the admiral stay with us.
[05:00.040 --> 05:05.880]  Joe Biggs here with info wars.com conservative icon Phyllis Laughley dead at 92. She is and
[05:05.880 --> 05:10.600]  was an icon of human liberty said Alex Jones. Without trailblazers like her, we would have
[05:10.600 --> 05:16.480]  no chance against the forces of tyranny. Laughley, a formidable pro family grassroots organizer
[05:16.480 --> 05:22.280]  who was politically active for 70 years, founded the conservative Eagle form in 1972 and served
[05:22.280 --> 05:28.280]  as president since then, overseeing the organization's rise to 80,000 members today. Her focus
[05:28.280 --> 05:33.040]  from her earliest days until her final ones was protecting the family, which she understood
[05:33.040 --> 05:38.040]  as the building block of life. The Eagle form said in a statement, she recognized America
[05:38.040 --> 05:43.000]  as the greatest political embodiment of those values from military superiority and defense
[05:43.000 --> 05:47.800]  immigration trade from unborn life to the nuclear family and parenthood. Phyllis Laughley
[05:47.800 --> 05:52.880]  was a courageous and articulate voice for common sense and traditional values. You can find
[05:52.880 --> 06:01.160]  more reports like this at info wars.com. Not a group you develop living defense for us.
[06:01.160 --> 06:05.560]  It took you over a year to do it. Why is this so good? Because people are actually waking
[06:05.560 --> 06:10.480]  up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most. I mean, I try to make sure that
[06:10.480 --> 06:15.560]  I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system. But right now we're
[06:15.560 --> 06:21.360]  dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off
[06:21.360 --> 06:27.200]  a host mechanism right now with all the refugees, spreading disease around. We have biological
[06:27.200 --> 06:31.360]  warfare going on everywhere. These are all parasites. Tell us about all the stuff. There's
[06:31.360 --> 06:35.080]  so many things that are in it. You have the name in there. You have the organic clove
[06:35.080 --> 06:40.520]  bud, the organic wormwood. I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[06:40.520 --> 06:43.520]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today. It
[06:43.520 --> 06:47.480]  just came back in yesterday. Living Defense, infowarslife.com. And folks, you can't lose.
[06:47.480 --> 06:53.600]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period. And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com.
[06:53.600 --> 06:56.840]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center. Thank you so much for all your work,
[06:56.840 --> 06:57.840]  sir, on this great product.
[06:57.840 --> 07:03.680]  More than two years ago, info wars first told you about our research into what has been
[07:03.680 --> 07:08.240]  called the iodine conspiracy. I've told you about how scientists have known for decades
[07:08.240 --> 07:13.160]  that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ and how the government, knowingly, started
[07:13.160 --> 07:18.080]  taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into
[07:18.080 --> 07:22.640]  the water. They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in. And when the
[07:22.640 --> 07:27.440]  Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how
[07:27.440 --> 07:33.240]  to prepare yourself and your family. Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed
[07:33.240 --> 07:38.640]  concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying
[07:38.640 --> 07:43.360]  could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine. You can pull these studies up for
[07:43.360 --> 07:47.720]  yourself. This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in
[07:47.720 --> 07:54.680]  my view, to any optimum health regimen. Stock up on Survival Shield X2 Today at infowarslife.com,

[08:21.360 --> 08:27.200]  When we talk about technocracy, we talk about the global stone definition of it from Davos
[08:27.200 --> 08:32.800]  a few years ago when the world leaders were meeting with the corporate owners of the planet.
[08:32.800 --> 08:38.360]  And they said it will be where one large central committee with pre-programmed computers controls
[08:38.360 --> 08:42.800]  everything you do, everything you eat, where you go, what you're allowed to engage in,
[08:42.800 --> 08:49.240]  what jobs you can have. And once the technocracy's in place, no one will be able to oppose it
[08:49.240 --> 08:53.440]  because it's designed to first hit you completely dependent on it, where you can't live without
[08:53.440 --> 09:00.320]  it. That's what they call silicon checkmate. And here's an article out of the Express News
[09:00.320 --> 09:08.720]  today. Google smart cars will be able to detect exactly where the police are. But it's okay,
[09:08.720 --> 09:13.040]  they're robots. But who runs the robots? And see, then, of course, the police are demanding
[09:13.040 --> 09:18.040]  access to the system that remote controls the cars. And Google's saying, of course, we'll
[09:18.040 --> 09:24.520]  put it in your cars, too, for the officer's safety. And so it creates a digital race where
[09:24.520 --> 09:31.920]  everyone that interfaces with this, and you can be completely taken over. This is the
[09:31.920 --> 09:39.080]  technotronic plan. And I can use a cheesy analogy of a TV series I actually watched
[09:39.080 --> 09:42.920]  the first year of six, seven, eight years ago on treadmill, when I'm getting on the
[09:42.920 --> 09:47.680]  treadmill every day. And that was the remake of Battlestar Galactica, where all the Battlestars
[09:47.680 --> 09:53.640]  get taken over because they're high tech, and they've got the latest systems in them.
[09:53.640 --> 09:58.840]  Which of course, the infiltrating Cylons had already, quote, develop the technology and
[09:58.840 --> 10:06.880]  basically given it to them. And then it was too late when they got hit. Now, I use the
[10:06.880 --> 10:11.320]  analogy of a TV show, Science Fiction, because the public needs to understand this is not
[10:11.320 --> 10:17.400]  my opinion. The Big New Brzezinski wrote a book, the technotronic era back in the 70s
[10:17.400 --> 10:23.880]  admitting this whole plan. And admitting the government ships in the drugs, and the government
[10:23.880 --> 10:32.080]  runs the child kidnapping rings, and his argument is, well, that's how we control it. That's
[10:32.080 --> 10:37.640]  how we keep it smaller. No, you notice it gets bigger and more out of control the more
[10:37.640 --> 10:47.240]  you quote control it. Very, very Machiavelli. And the truth is about globalism, it was sold
[10:47.240 --> 10:52.840]  as this wonderful way to take the technology of the West, export it to the third world,
[10:52.840 --> 10:59.720]  build them up, to then actually create a system of global stability. But instead, the top
[10:59.720 --> 11:05.120]  globalists have been using it to screw everybody over, consolidate power, and cause massive
[11:05.120 --> 11:09.960]  population problems. It was rolled out 65 years ago to actually reduce population, it
[11:09.960 --> 11:15.480]  did the opposite, because there was a double cross. I was having a discussion with my father
[11:15.480 --> 11:21.200]  about that yesterday. Back when he was going to UT in the 60s, they were openly pushing
[11:21.200 --> 11:25.840]  world government and eugenics and everything else, the plan to students, as people that
[11:25.840 --> 11:29.640]  had been in college when they were in high school. And it was just all a giant double
[11:29.640 --> 11:34.800]  cross of all the well-meaning little minions of the system. If you want to be double cross,
[11:34.800 --> 11:40.120]  that's up to you. I don't. Because the world government project is fundamentally anti-human.
[11:40.120 --> 11:45.360]  Now, now that's the first article I wanted to just open the salvo with today. And I've
[11:45.360 --> 11:51.560]  got a whole stack of technology news that that ties into. And how there's an epidemic
[11:51.560 --> 12:00.440]  of depression, an epidemic of brain damage, even in pets in your home and neurological
[12:00.440 --> 12:11.040]  disorders there. It's a cornucopia, a cocktail of reasons, but it's the GMO food integrated
[12:11.040 --> 12:17.000]  with humans with screen time that lowers dopamine levels and basically creates a zombified
[12:17.000 --> 12:22.000]  state. That's in the news today. But don't worry, Royal Navy unveils a robot spy speed
[12:22.000 --> 12:28.440]  boat. And it's just a boat humans would be on, but now the central system can run it
[12:28.440 --> 12:35.880]  and cover up whatever it wants. A pet dementia blamed on lazy lifestyles and poor diets.
[12:35.880 --> 12:41.840]  Researchers confront an epidemic of loneliness. The more we get interface with machines, the
[12:41.840 --> 12:49.080]  more lonely we are. I'm sure it's not by design. And it goes on and on. Daily mail. Though
[12:49.080 --> 12:56.000]  attacks crossfit. Yes, don't exercise. Whatever you do. Now, let's let me do. I'm not even
[12:56.000 --> 13:00.200]  hitting top stories right now. I'm just giving you a little sampling here of what we have.
[13:00.200 --> 13:07.960]  We have icon Phyllis Schlafly dead at 92. We interviewed her just about a month ago.
[13:07.960 --> 13:13.800]  And I do want to sometime this week, take that 20 minute interview and re-air it here
[13:13.800 --> 13:20.440]  on the broadcast. And she even wrote a column the day she died. And that was published in
[13:20.440 --> 13:29.480]  WorldNet Daily, WND.com. It's up on DrudgeReport.com. Write dead smack in the middle of the column.
[13:29.480 --> 13:34.800]  That who was working yesterday called me and said, what was your statement like to be on
[13:34.800 --> 13:39.360]  Phyllis Schlafly dying? And I said, I didn't know that. Let me call you back. And I went
[13:39.360 --> 13:44.280]  and read about it, a little tear in my eye because she was a great lady and just a humanitarian
[13:44.280 --> 13:49.040]  and very down to earth and brilliant. And she really is the heart of carrying the ball
[13:49.040 --> 13:56.080]  forward after Barry Goldwater in mobilizing true patriots against the establishment Republicans
[13:56.080 --> 14:03.640]  and the Democrats and the globalist, constitutional lawyer and just somebody who worked so hard.
[14:03.640 --> 14:07.640]  She would work even in her 90s, five, 10, 15 hours a day depending on which day of the
[14:07.640 --> 14:11.720]  week doing radio interviews. Phyllis Schlafly, the leading pioneer of the American conservative
[14:11.720 --> 14:14.680]  movement. I want to get her son on, by the way, wasn't going to be her daughter, but
[14:14.680 --> 14:19.400]  her daughter, unfortunately, double crossed her with Ted Cruz. So she's not running things
[14:19.400 --> 14:23.800]  now. We need to get her son on the broadcast, continue on promoting the Eagle Forum. Phyllis
[14:23.800 --> 14:28.560]  Schlafly, the leading pioneer of America's conservative movement, dead at the age of
[14:28.560 --> 14:36.320]  92. And I had this to say about her in the article we wrote from forewords.com. She is
[14:36.320 --> 14:44.080]  and was, or you can say she was and is, but she is, she will live on. She is and was an
[14:44.080 --> 14:49.600]  icon of human liberty without trailblazers like her. We would have no chance against
[14:49.600 --> 14:56.360]  the forces of tyranny. And her work will live on forever, especially obviously if the species
[14:56.360 --> 15:01.040]  survives. But don't worry, Twitter users, Mach Phyllis Schlafly, celebrate her death
[15:01.040 --> 15:06.040]  daily call reports. Then of course, there's her last column, very important article to
[15:06.040 --> 15:12.960]  read, very presidential, very detente-ish, very classy. Trump in Mexico recalls Reagan
[15:12.960 --> 15:18.200]  in Geneva. I'm going to cover some of that today if we have time, but everyone should
[15:18.200 --> 15:23.920]  go read the column. Now I'm getting into the economic news and I'm going to plow into
[15:23.920 --> 15:32.240]  all these stories in more detail today. This is just alarm bells over the top. Now when
[15:32.240 --> 15:36.240]  the Russians announced this last Friday, there were articles poo-pooing it in the Financial
[15:36.240 --> 15:42.720]  Times of London and other places. But Russia and Saudi Arabia are now discussing oil production
[15:42.720 --> 15:47.560]  freeze, Russian energy minister to kind of counter what's been going on in other areas
[15:47.560 --> 15:56.280]  creating this big glut. Prices have fallen from 114 per barrel to 45 to 50. But by today,
[15:56.280 --> 16:03.920]  the effects were seen. Treasuries climb, dollar falls as traders trim, Fed hike wagers. That's
[16:03.920 --> 16:11.880]  right, the Fed is talking about increasing interest rates. Oil prices jump up to Russia
[16:11.880 --> 16:16.320]  and Saudi Arabia create market stability task force. So that's big economic news. We're
[16:16.320 --> 16:22.040]  going to be looking at all of that today as well. But first, this will take some time
[16:22.040 --> 16:25.400]  today because we need to probably air all of it even though it's very irritating to
[16:25.400 --> 16:30.320]  listen to. Hillary's always irritating, but I have to tell you it's a little bit of a
[16:30.320 --> 16:34.880]  silver lining when you realize that she is a dangerous threat to clear and present danger
[16:34.880 --> 16:41.520]  by every barometric, by every yardstick, by every algorithm, by every historical lens
[16:41.520 --> 16:53.600]  through which we stare, our little moral mortal coils blowing in the intergalactic breeze.
[16:53.600 --> 16:57.200]  Hillary Clinton's coughing fits and then her coming out saying it's a conspiracy theory
[16:57.200 --> 17:03.000]  and she starts coughing during it. Those who the gods will destroy, they first make mad.
[17:03.000 --> 17:08.840]  Again, I forget who said that, but it's certainly true. And we've got massive coverage at infowars.com
[17:08.840 --> 17:13.760]  on this, gradsreport.com as usual has a full spectrum analysis, including one of our stories.
[17:13.760 --> 17:17.960]  Media caught in blatant lie to cover up Hillary's coughing fits. The type of things she says
[17:17.960 --> 17:24.240]  she's allergic to was actually low. Grasses were medium. Others overall were low. So local
[17:24.240 --> 17:29.160]  news says it was low to medium, but the media said it was extremely high, in fact, record
[17:29.160 --> 17:33.320]  high. But she barely finished her speech. No, she had to stop her speech. You can clearly
[17:33.320 --> 17:40.480]  see she just stops and cuts it off. I have a mold allergy that it makes me cough when
[17:40.480 --> 17:43.700]  I go for a jog or hike for hours out in the middle of it. When it's super high, it's been
[17:43.700 --> 17:49.520]  raining here for months and months. That's how Texas works. It's either dry or wet, depending
[17:49.520 --> 17:56.840]  on what cycle you're in. And so, yeah, some days I'll cough some, but it's for a couple
[17:56.840 --> 18:02.760]  minutes, you know, total in the day, 30 seconds here, 10 seconds there. Hillary can't give
[18:02.760 --> 18:06.760]  a press conference because of it. She can't get back from the bathroom on time during
[18:06.760 --> 18:12.280]  a debate. Everybody has to wait five minutes. She seriously has health problems. She talks
[18:12.280 --> 18:20.360]  about Parkinson's medication in her own WikiLeaks documents. And now one of the top trending
[18:20.360 --> 18:24.960]  hashtags is Hillary's wheelchair, which of course is from a month ago with our Secret
[18:24.960 --> 18:32.800]  Service sources that said that they have upwards of over $250,000 of equipment to lower her
[18:32.800 --> 18:36.200]  in and out of vehicles. Well, we finally have photos of her going in fundraisers. And here
[18:36.200 --> 18:40.280]  is this thing with a big lowering back. I was thinking it was lowering deals on the
[18:40.280 --> 18:44.200]  side and the Secret Service is like, no, it's more sophisticated. We now have photos of
[18:44.200 --> 18:52.600]  it. So very, very interesting, but it appears that she's just sitting in the back and then
[18:52.600 --> 18:57.680]  gets out once she gets there. So she's in serious, serious health decline. She's a guy following
[18:57.680 --> 19:04.240]  her around with a, with a tranquilizer pen. And now it's been confirmed by Page Six, New
[19:04.240 --> 19:11.360]  York Post, CNN demanded Dr. Drew retract health comments and he wouldn't do it. That ties
[19:11.360 --> 19:17.520]  into this. Shut it down. Reuters orders cameraman to kill positive Trump footage. And why is
[19:17.520 --> 19:21.520]  that important? Because right side news and others, they get, they pay Reuters and then
[19:21.520 --> 19:25.720]  they get, we ought to do that too. You go to Thompson Reuters and you pay and that's
[19:25.720 --> 19:29.040]  how people stream and get these feeds all over the country. You can't afford to send
[19:29.040 --> 19:32.600]  somebody as a small media outlet everywhere in the country. But see Reuters, you hear
[19:32.600 --> 19:36.760]  them saying, Hey, the orders are cut it off. No, we're not going to show this. Just like
[19:36.760 --> 19:41.240]  CNN has been caught censoring, just like they're always cutting feeds. There's massive censorship
[19:41.240 --> 19:47.320]  by these central hubs. This time it's been caught on video, but it doesn't matter. Hillary
[19:47.320 --> 19:53.680]  Blames lengthy coughing fit on Trump allergy. Isn't that just special? I'm Alex Jones,

[23:57.800 --> 24:27.600]  By the way, I don't mention this to be shocking, but I'm going to show it later on the TV portion
[24:27.600 --> 24:34.600]  of the show.
[24:57.600 --> 25:11.960]  This is the type of stuff that's going on ladies and gentlemen. Okay, I mean this is
[25:11.960 --> 25:20.680]  how overwhelming the news has gotten. Now Obama landed yesterday in China and I saw Trump
[25:20.680 --> 25:25.560]  talking about this right when it happened saying, as you notice when Obama just landed
[25:25.560 --> 25:29.480]  yesterday, he had to get off the back of the plane, no red carpet. I mean normally you
[25:29.480 --> 25:35.200]  do that for a major ambassador. This is unprecedented for a major president. It's a major insult.
[25:35.200 --> 25:39.480]  The media began saying within minutes he was a conspiracy theorist until all the diplomats
[25:39.480 --> 25:43.480]  and everybody else came out and said no, this is a huge insult, especially in Asia where
[25:43.480 --> 25:51.520]  it's all about honor and showing a good face to things and ceremony. It was a huge insult
[25:51.520 --> 25:57.200]  to make him get off the back of the plane. And then Chinese officials, when Obama's
[25:57.200 --> 26:03.640]  advanced staff got off, yelled at him, hey, this is our airport. This is our country.
[26:03.640 --> 26:10.120]  We'll do whatever we want. So again, this is all shot by Reuters who then cut the feed
[26:10.120 --> 26:12.760]  because they didn't want you to see exactly what happens. We only have somebody shot on
[26:12.760 --> 26:16.960]  a cell phone and the audio is not too good. But I was, Fox News was able to tune it up
[26:16.960 --> 26:21.640]  a little bit. But let's, let's play a clip of this, but this is all about dragging America
[26:21.640 --> 26:26.400]  through the mud and teaching us that we're trash. That's what Obama's all about. It's
[26:26.400 --> 26:36.240]  about America's nothing, globalism is everything here it is.
[26:36.240 --> 26:40.920]  This is our country, our airport. There's longer clips up on infowars.com and obviously
[26:40.920 --> 26:46.440]  on the news because I watched them this morning. Now think about this. What's the message
[26:46.440 --> 26:52.560]  here? Never before would a president even get off the plane if it was ordered to get
[26:52.560 --> 26:56.240]  off the back and you're not supposed to have a ceremony and have the quote honor guard
[26:56.240 --> 27:00.320]  and all the rest of it. I personally don't like pop in circumstance, but that's what
[27:00.320 --> 27:05.560]  they do. And that's what the Chinese president gets when he comes here. The problem is China
[27:05.560 --> 27:10.400]  already bosses Hollywood around China is the most evil country on earth and has killed
[27:10.400 --> 27:14.120]  80 plus million of its own people under one leader alone. They have mobile execution
[27:14.120 --> 27:18.040]  events in every city. If you smart mouth the government, they chop your testicles off.
[27:18.040 --> 27:21.720]  But I mean, that's what they do. And then stab you a few times and bleed to death on
[27:21.720 --> 27:26.080]  the street. The public will not help you or they get put in a forced labor camp. If you're
[27:26.080 --> 27:32.520]  caught practicing even mild Buddhism exercises, you are given life in prison. If you're lucky,
[27:32.520 --> 27:38.360]  if not, you are put in a facility blood tested, typed, ready to have your organs harvested
[27:38.360 --> 27:45.000]  as soon as a rich westerner is ready for the surgeries. And see, oh, the little trendy
[27:45.000 --> 27:50.200]  Ivy League, you know, feminist ladies want to get off and boss the Chinese around. And
[27:50.200 --> 27:54.480]  they're just like, Hey, it's our country. Get out of here. It's our airport. These are
[27:54.480 --> 27:58.800]  real tyrants. These are people that really get their hands in the blood. They suppress
[27:58.800 --> 28:03.960]  thousands of riots a month. They kill millions of their own people a year. They go and get
[28:03.960 --> 28:11.440]  little baby girls and drown them or keep them for body parts harvesting. There's a billion
[28:11.440 --> 28:15.840]  300 million people in China. And so you're going to swagger around with your Harvard
[28:15.840 --> 28:19.720]  degree and everything. You're going to be told, get off the back of the airplane. You're
[28:19.720 --> 28:23.720]  going to be told you're nothing. And we're going to chew you out on the tarmac. And I'm
[28:23.720 --> 28:27.760]  going to find, because I saw this morning, the longer clip, because I mean, I mean, there's
[28:27.760 --> 28:33.800]  a bunch of this going on where they're just down there chewing people out. And you notice
[28:33.800 --> 28:38.240]  there's a big fracas outside the airplane and a bunch of people and Chinese officials
[28:38.240 --> 28:43.440]  smiling and getting off on it, because this was about rubbing people's noses in it. And
[28:43.440 --> 28:47.840]  whereas I love seeing Obama get his nose rubbed in something, it's about rubbing our nose.
[28:47.840 --> 28:51.040]  We've given the Communist Chinese the Panama Canal. We've given them most of our deep water
[28:51.040 --> 28:54.600]  ports. We've given them almost all of our industry. We've given them 97% of rare earth
[28:54.600 --> 28:59.360]  minerals worldwide. And now we're giving them all of our weapons secrets because the globalist
[28:59.360 --> 29:06.320]  are going to use China to take over the world. The globalists have sold us out to China because
[29:06.320 --> 29:13.680]  China is the most brutal eugenics based system that makes Adolf, Alois, Hitler look like
[29:13.680 --> 29:22.640]  a amateur, an amateur, an amateur compared to the Communist Chinese. No one is more blood
[29:22.640 --> 29:28.360]  thirsty. No one is more soulless. No one is more demonic. No one is more evil. That's
[29:28.360 --> 29:32.400]  why there's this fawning with George Soros and the Rockefellers and Rothschilds. A lot
[29:32.400 --> 29:37.400]  of them have moved to China a lot of the year and just groveling in the satanicness of it,
[29:37.400 --> 29:43.120]  the anti-humanist of it, as they feed on over a billion slaves with a tiny Communist party
[29:43.120 --> 29:48.800]  sucking off of them. They now own the majority of our debt we've been sold out.
[29:48.800 --> 29:59.480]  Here on the March, The Empire's on the Run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:59.480 --> 30:04.080]  Joe Biggs here with infowars.com. Does Hillary Clinton have Parkinson's disease? We can all
[30:04.080 --> 30:08.520]  see that she has some very serious health problems. Article up by Michael Snyder. It
[30:08.520 --> 30:12.480]  has been my contention for a long time that Hillary Clinton would do or say just about
[30:12.480 --> 30:16.680]  anything in order to become the first woman president. But what she actually lied to the
[30:16.680 --> 30:20.720]  American people about her health in order to reach that historic achievement? In recent
[30:20.720 --> 30:26.080]  days the Clinton campaign has assured us over and over again about how healthy Hillary
[30:26.080 --> 30:31.040]  is. And she even opened up a jar of pickles for Jimmy Kimmel in order to prove how vigorous
[30:31.040 --> 30:35.240]  she is at her age. But we can all see that she has some very serious health problems.
[30:35.240 --> 30:39.480]  On Labor Day, Clinton had another one of her epic coughing fits and this time it happened
[30:39.480 --> 30:44.200]  during an election rally in Cleveland that was being broadcast nationwide. She attempted
[30:44.200 --> 30:48.520]  to laugh it off by making jokes such as every time I think about Trump I get allergic. Guess
[30:48.520 --> 30:52.840]  what? You're sick. We're all finding out the lies are coming out. We are going to destroy
[30:52.840 --> 30:59.400]  you collectively by exposing your lies. You can find more reports like this infowars.com.
[30:59.400 --> 31:15.120]  I've been working all day. I took a couple hours off coaching basketball. I get in here
[31:15.120 --> 31:16.640]  at 8 30. I was kind of run down. You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make
[31:16.640 --> 31:20.320]  it and I really wanted to do a good job on the interview. I got my bottle of brain force
[31:20.320 --> 31:24.680]  right there. Pop two of them and about 20 minutes later, it's like everything just kind
[31:24.680 --> 31:29.640]  of clears up. It's got four and a half stars. People really love it. Read about it. Find
[31:29.640 --> 31:34.240]  out why third party. Neuceratical sites give it such high praise because it really does
[31:34.240 --> 31:39.200]  have the best organic based systems that will blow your socks off. I haven't pulled an all
[31:39.200 --> 31:42.720]  nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without brain force.
[31:42.720 --> 31:47.400]  I went home about 6 45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up took two more
[31:47.400 --> 31:54.280]  brain force and came in. You will find a brain force and other game changing products at infowarslife.com

[33:21.080 --> 33:33.720]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance. Live from Austin, Texas.
[33:33.720 --> 33:42.160]  Broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[33:42.160 --> 33:56.800]  Hillary Clinton is crashing and burning. Implematic. Iconic. She's falling. And it's all a signature,
[33:56.800 --> 34:04.600]  a signet of the establishment itself. Disrespected worldwide. Hated. Communist China doesn't let
[34:04.600 --> 34:08.160]  their government get infiltrated like ours does. Russia doesn't let their government
[34:08.160 --> 34:14.280]  get infiltrated like we do. Germany was captured after World War II. That's why it's run
[34:14.280 --> 34:22.920]  by the globalist. England is where this system of control basically comes from. But in through
[34:22.920 --> 34:28.080]  the outdoor, it's now trying to pull out of its own system. And the United States has
[34:28.080 --> 34:34.080]  been the big muscle for all of it. I'm going to get into the coughing fits now and I'm
[34:34.080 --> 34:42.640]  going to play it all. The entire coughing fit. She had to stop her speech in Cleveland.
[34:42.640 --> 34:47.200]  Then her so-called first press conference in 270 plus days, which was not a press conference.
[34:47.200 --> 34:52.640]  It was to a group of fawning sycophantic women. I'm going to show you photos, not just a video
[34:52.640 --> 34:58.400]  of her speaking, but how they were fawning on the other side. Looking at her like she
[34:58.400 --> 35:09.280]  was a goddess incarnate. And then we're going to show her talking about conspiracy theorists.
[35:09.280 --> 35:14.960]  This is why the press never asked Hillary real questions. They look like a bunch of
[35:14.960 --> 35:23.040]  fawning schoolgirls. That's what Paul Joseph Watson tweeted. This is why the press never
[35:23.040 --> 35:29.400]  asked Hillary real questions. They look like enraptured tweenies meeting Taylor Swift. Truly
[35:29.400 --> 35:36.440]  disgusting. But that's like North Korea. Whenever Kim Jong-un died, or Kim Jong-il, sorry,
[35:36.440 --> 35:43.400]  Freudian slip, three days of crying and yelling and beating your chest. Because if you didn't,
[35:43.400 --> 35:47.840]  you get sent to a forced labor camp or worse. And then when he would walk by or his son
[35:47.840 --> 35:52.040]  walks by, you have to look at him like you're just so amazed. Like, oh my gosh, you're so
[35:52.040 --> 36:01.440]  incredible. And this issue is going to take over the power structure of this country.
[36:01.440 --> 36:08.560]  You can say what you want about our past leaders, but we really have soft, little twisted control
[36:08.560 --> 36:12.640]  freaks who think that they manage reality. They tell us how to talk. They tell us how
[36:12.640 --> 36:18.080]  to speak. They tell us what to think. Just like Gary Johnson, he's talking to the town
[36:18.080 --> 36:23.480]  hall reporter, says, listen, you don't use the word illegal immigrant. Is that understood?
[36:23.480 --> 36:28.360]  The guy's like, well, why not? And he goes, man, I told you to. I mean, it's like I control
[36:28.360 --> 36:35.400]  reality. I'm history's actor. We define language. We tell you what to do. Do you understand?
[36:35.400 --> 36:43.200]  Go back into your trance. I'm the official. I'm the boss back into your trance. It's
[36:43.200 --> 36:47.960]  not weird to have a strange Nazi collaborator spending millions of dollars over the government.
[36:47.960 --> 36:51.600]  Who's already thrown a bunch of other governments over. It's not a big deal to have big global
[36:51.600 --> 36:56.500]  foundations funding Gary Johnson, who's VP running mate says he wants to ban guns and
[36:56.500 --> 37:00.360]  Gary Johnson wants open borders and have us run by the foreign TPP. It's okay because
[37:00.360 --> 37:09.440]  he talks real slow as a fake intellectual. He is our master. Come here, Von Helsing.
[37:09.440 --> 37:15.520]  No, I won't. I said, come here. You have a strong will for man who's only lived one
[37:15.520 --> 37:32.400]  life. Gary Johnson has the will of a pile of dog manure. You're a joke. But Gary Johnson
[37:32.400 --> 37:38.680]  said he controls reality. Now that's noticed that we execute and sweet and funny and nonthreatening.
[37:38.680 --> 37:43.320]  That's the cover. I'm surprised he's having a little, you know, hand muppet in his hand
[37:43.320 --> 37:48.080]  seeing songs to us about how much he loves us. I'm nonthreatening. I've got an ice
[37:48.080 --> 37:55.320]  cream truck. I've got puppies. I've got candy. World governments good. Turn your guns in.
[37:55.320 --> 38:03.840]  Oh, we love you. Open the borders. La la la. I'm so liberal. Gary Johnson vote for me.
[38:03.840 --> 38:08.800]  Stop Trump. I love Hillary. La la la la. Sorry. Okay, I'm gonna stop right now. Please
[38:08.800 --> 38:15.280]  take him off screen. I'm gonna get serious. Okay, I'm gonna plow through the Hillary
[38:15.280 --> 38:20.560]  coughing news, the huge economic news, a bunch of internet takeover news. Obama says the
[38:20.560 --> 38:25.440]  internet cannot be like the wall wall West. We have mutant pigs with human faces and a
[38:25.440 --> 38:30.720]  penis for a forehead. We just we just have the new world order. We have the fruits of
[38:30.720 --> 38:40.680]  corruption, the wages of sin. We know what those are. Now continuing here, normally only
[38:40.680 --> 38:44.320]  did this special once a year. I've been doing it every few months because the world's a
[38:44.320 --> 38:50.240]  crazy place. Anybody with half a brain knows that we all need to be self sufficient. We
[38:50.240 --> 38:55.800]  all need to be prepared. We all need to be 70% involved politically trying to stop this
[38:55.800 --> 39:03.000]  new world order. But 30% of the time is my view getting ready. Major World War, globalism,
[39:03.000 --> 39:10.440]  economic crises, false flags, you name it, have gone from possibilities to probabilities
[39:10.440 --> 39:17.560]  to absolutes. It just depends on how intense and the globalist are gauging us worldwide
[39:17.560 --> 39:22.840]  populations wanting us to be dependent, wanting us to not be self sufficient. That's why we
[39:22.840 --> 39:26.640]  have a symbiotic operation here with super high quality preparedness goods from short
[39:26.640 --> 39:31.200]  wave radios to water filtration systems to solar panel systems that are the highest quality
[39:31.200 --> 39:37.800]  for the lowest price with great control units. And of course the widest spectrum of the highest
[39:37.800 --> 39:43.680]  quality storeable food that lasts 25 years from my patriot supply, private labeled exact
[39:43.680 --> 39:50.560]  same food so that I can contractually give you 30 to 40% off. 30% off, they're already
[39:50.560 --> 39:55.040]  lowest prices he's unheard of. 40% which we can do on a few of the packs or more than
[39:55.040 --> 40:00.760]  a few, a bunch of them is unbelievable. Because September is preparedness month, new preparedness
[40:00.760 --> 40:05.040]  mega specials at infowarstore.com. To celebrate national preparedness month, we are giving
[40:05.040 --> 40:09.920]  you up to 40% off on our top selling preparedness items at infowarstore.com. The sum of preparedness
[40:09.920 --> 40:15.280]  mega specials at infowarstore.com include 30 to 40% off, info war select storeable food.
[40:15.280 --> 40:19.640]  We call info war select being its high quality. It's the full spectrum. 20% off, survival
[40:19.640 --> 40:25.560]  shield X2, nascent iodine, absolute 20% off, Alexa pure air filters, 20% off Alexa pure
[40:25.560 --> 40:30.400]  water filters and many, many others. With everything going on in the world right now.
[40:30.400 --> 40:33.720]  It is now more important than ever to start getting prepared. I have an emergency food
[40:33.720 --> 40:38.600]  supply that I've expanded for my family and even for the entire office here. I've stockpiled
[40:38.600 --> 40:45.880]  food, solar panel systems, gas generators, firearms, security personnel, and yeah, the
[40:45.880 --> 40:50.080]  world. We've never done any of this. Okay. I mean, you can feel it. You can see it.
[40:50.080 --> 40:56.160]  You can smell it. Get ready. Drums, drums in the deep. Visit infowarstore.com and get
[40:56.160 --> 41:00.400]  up to 40% off of our top selling preparedness products. All supplies last. We can't do this
[41:00.400 --> 41:06.240]  very long. We did it for like a week. Usually that would stop. Now I'm doing every few months.
[41:06.240 --> 41:10.640]  Also experienced the power of bio tricillinium that will sell out very, very soon. Was going
[41:10.640 --> 41:14.040]  to sell out last week with a big spike in orders. Then I didn't, I stopped plugging
[41:14.040 --> 41:17.920]  why it's so good and it slowed down. But I'm going to just tell you, this is the very best
[41:17.920 --> 41:22.600]  selenium out there from our research from mustard seed, a really powerful dose of it.
[41:22.600 --> 41:25.720]  Electrochemical activities are impossible in the body. That's also your activity without
[41:25.720 --> 41:29.200]  selenium. The government's always saying you need less and less than this. Just like
[41:29.200 --> 41:32.720]  you need more and more fluoride because they care about you and your family. No, because
[41:32.720 --> 41:36.480]  the eugenicists at the top are held bent on destroying us. And even the vast majority
[41:36.480 --> 41:40.320]  of EPA scientists, in fact, 99% of them have signed letters to separate times saying, please
[41:40.320 --> 41:45.200]  take fluoride out. Somebody's been blaming them. It's people on top. Point is you need,
[41:45.200 --> 41:55.400]  you need good iodine. We only promote the highest quality bio available 99999 true iodine.
[41:55.400 --> 42:01.360]  And it goes perfectly with bio true selenium available at info wars store.com or info wars
[42:01.360 --> 42:07.040]  life.com. And part of preparedness is 20% off X2. So great way to stock up on the true
[42:07.040 --> 42:13.800]  iodine today as well. And that funding again will allow us to keep the reporters we have
[42:13.800 --> 42:17.600]  and hopefully had a few more and more writers and more researchers to be able to cover the
[42:17.600 --> 42:22.960]  field of what's actually happening and unfolding. Please support our local affiliates as well.
[42:22.960 --> 42:26.280]  Spread the word about the broadcast on your local AM and FM stations. Become a sponsor
[42:26.280 --> 42:30.480]  or support the local sponsors and let them know why you're supporting them or send $5,
[42:30.480 --> 42:36.960]  $10, $50, $100 or a cake to the local station and thank them for what they are.
[42:36.960 --> 42:46.480]  Okay. Let me start over on the whole Hillary thing. I already kind of did a basic setup
[42:46.480 --> 42:50.760]  and I want to recap what the the compendium of what's been developing. Then I want to
[42:50.760 --> 42:55.600]  get into the latest. We have the WikiLeaks of Hillary two weeks ago. They admit it's
[42:55.600 --> 43:02.400]  real that she was looking for anti Parkinson's medication three years ago saying she wanted
[43:02.400 --> 43:07.360]  a doctor that would prescribe her that. We know that she was in and out of the hospital
[43:07.360 --> 43:16.280]  in 2012, 2013 and spent almost a year in the hospital at facilities in Maryland and other
[43:16.280 --> 43:22.880]  areas that focus on brain tumors, brain surgery, brain injuries. We know now the FBI released
[43:22.880 --> 43:28.400]  this last Friday right before Labor Day to bury it. We're going to bring it up today
[43:28.400 --> 43:34.660]  that Hillary told them that she couldn't remember anything of what happened with the servers
[43:34.660 --> 43:42.240]  because she had amnesia. She said she remembered nothing about any of the servers, any of the
[43:42.240 --> 43:49.760]  emails or anything she'd done because of a traumatic brain injury, a lasting concussion.
[43:49.760 --> 43:57.160]  So we have her saying, I need Parkinson's medication. We have her saying, I know nothing.
[43:57.160 --> 44:03.120]  Hillary's defense can't recall after the fall.
[44:03.120 --> 44:09.000]  So I can go on for hours. You have Dr. Drew now confirmed page six New York Post was kicked
[44:09.000 --> 44:15.560]  out of CNN headline news because he said it looks like they're giving her horrible medications
[44:15.560 --> 44:20.960]  that absolutely mix wrong and I don't know what's going on. We have all these other people
[44:20.960 --> 44:27.140]  that are being censored. We have Google censoring keywords that deal with her health. So with
[44:27.140 --> 44:33.920]  all of this happening, DrudgerPort.com has a blow by blow timeline of her coughing fits
[44:33.920 --> 44:39.680]  so many times I can't even read them all. But let's just cover what happened when she
[44:39.680 --> 44:46.840]  was in Ohio in one day. This all happened in one day. Can't give a speech she's having
[44:46.840 --> 44:52.120]  such a coughing fit. Looks like she's bombed out of her brain on some type of medication.
[44:52.120 --> 44:56.760]  Goes on the airplane with sycophantic minions worshiping her, has to stop the first press
[44:56.760 --> 45:04.840]  conference of 270 days that wasn't even really a real press conference with her fawning minions.
[45:04.840 --> 45:09.160]  And then she comes out and calls it a conspiracy theory and says that she's allergic to Donald
[45:09.160 --> 45:16.080]  Trump and it's all a big sick joke. It's all funny. The woman has serious health problems
[45:16.080 --> 45:23.520]  and the media has given us the credit in four wars dot com for creating the quote made up
[45:23.520 --> 45:30.880]  theory. No, there are now 10 prominent doctors. We have it listed on infowars.com. Drudge
[45:30.880 --> 45:35.440]  hasn't linked as well. I didn't find that in my stack. We got to print me that. Thank
[45:35.440 --> 45:42.760]  you. 10 prominent doctors, including Democrats, including Obama's former medical doctor, say
[45:42.760 --> 45:46.880]  she needs a neurological independent panel. Well, we had Dr. Pachennick on saying the
[45:46.880 --> 45:51.240]  same thing. 10 prominent doctors question Hillary's health. We're on that daily. Okay.
[45:51.240 --> 45:55.760]  And that's just 10. That's the article I told Watson the right last week. He was too busy.
[45:55.760 --> 45:58.720]  I said, there's got to be more than 10 doctors. You know, it's always the proverbial article,
[45:58.720 --> 46:06.800]  you know, 10 doctors, but whatever. There it is. 10 prominent doctors. Okay. This is
[46:06.800 --> 46:11.800]  normal medical procedure. She isn't releasing her real medical records. She released what's
[46:11.800 --> 46:17.520]  some family doctor from a decade ago had. Let's go ahead and go to her in Cleveland,
[46:17.520 --> 46:23.080]  having the coughing fit of coughing fits and having a serious, serious problem and then
[46:23.080 --> 46:27.920]  saying it's a conspiracy theory to question. Here it is. I want to thank Congresswoman Marsha
[46:27.920 --> 46:57.400]  Fudge for hosting us. I've been talking so every time I think about Trump, I get a lurchic.
[46:57.400 --> 47:11.880]  She's doing Saturday Night Live jokes. She is dying up there. Boy, we have 63 days to
[47:11.880 --> 47:31.480]  go out 62. Who knows if she's got that long left on this earth. Just saying. I don't
[47:31.480 --> 47:36.520]  wish her any harm though. I really don't. By the way, hit pause. I'm going to demarcate
[47:36.520 --> 47:44.340]  this at this point. I was sitting there this morning reading the news and like 6am, 630
[47:44.340 --> 47:55.400]  in bed with a little devilish iPad. And I was thinking to myself, if this lady really
[47:55.400 --> 47:59.960]  is collapsing and can't do the debates with Trump, and there's no way she can at this
[47:59.960 --> 48:04.480]  point. That's why they have to basically have the first debate me this back to back where
[48:04.480 --> 48:07.720]  she goes first. He goes after. They're not on the same stage. In case I guess she has
[48:07.720 --> 48:12.840]  to bow out, they got to go to video or something. I don't know how they're gonna pull this off.
[48:12.840 --> 48:16.280]  One of the ways they could pull the globalist bacon out of the fire, because in the words
[48:16.280 --> 48:20.840]  the economists and the words of the Financial Times, all the big globalist mouthpieces and
[48:20.840 --> 48:27.040]  organs. They're saying if Hillary falls, the New World Order global government is in desperate
[48:27.040 --> 48:31.280]  trouble. Washington Post has said the same thing. The end of the New World Order, the
[48:31.280 --> 48:35.320]  end of globalism, they are in trouble because these are referendums on them, okay? This
[48:35.320 --> 48:45.040]  is huge. Tide's totally turned. How do you grab victory from the jaws of defeat? Or how
[48:45.040 --> 48:52.760]  do they spin this? They kill Hillary Clinton and they blame it on folks like myself because
[48:52.760 --> 48:56.800]  I kept wondering last month how they keep implying that I physically want to hurt Hillary
[48:56.800 --> 49:02.760]  Clinton. Or they had some graphic about her campaign is blowing away. She's disintegrating.
[49:02.760 --> 49:06.480]  And they heard me say that's the metagraphic where she's like sand being blown away. And
[49:06.480 --> 49:12.280]  the news was all, Jones has a graphic of her brains being blown out. Let's be clear. Hillary
[49:12.280 --> 49:16.160]  is a front person, though she's nasty and horrible. I want to see her stand trial so
[49:16.160 --> 49:20.840]  that other criminals in government back off and stop sending this country towards World
[49:20.840 --> 49:28.960]  War III. But myself or no one else is associated in this audience with wanting to hurt Hillary
[49:28.960 --> 49:33.880]  Clinton. And that's on record. And the Secret Service knows that. So good luck, media. If
[49:33.880 --> 49:40.680]  you have some mental patient or some windup toy or some loon, kill her and then try to
[49:40.680 --> 49:45.040]  blame on the Liberty Movement. It's not going to work. Oh, the first woman president she
[49:45.040 --> 49:50.080]  was going to win. And by the way, even in their cook polls from CNN to the LA Times
[49:50.080 --> 49:57.280]  to Reuters to Bloomberg this week, guess who is up in the polls? Two to three to four points
[49:57.280 --> 50:05.760]  ahead of Hillary, even with cooked polls. Donald Trump is ahead of her. We went out
[50:05.760 --> 50:10.680]  to the UT football game on Sunday. Normally they're on Saturday. It was on Sunday. Our
[50:10.680 --> 50:15.240]  crew did. And we could find almost no one who was for Hillary. And if they did on the
[50:15.240 --> 50:22.960]  skip this break, they would say we hate Hillary. But you know, we have to be politically correct.
[50:22.960 --> 50:27.280]  And I guarantee a lot of these folks are just saying that on camera. It is so embarrassing.
[50:27.280 --> 50:31.520]  It is so ridiculous, this peer pressure. But even in Austin, as opposed to big liberal
[50:31.520 --> 50:40.360]  area of Texas, we could find almost no one, including Hispanics, you name it, that supported
[50:40.360 --> 50:46.360]  Hillary. I don't see your bumper stickers. All I see, I saw one today. It's like, oh,
[50:46.360 --> 50:51.600]  look at Hillary sticker. How rare. I see Hillary for prison stickers all over the place. All
[50:51.600 --> 50:56.720]  over the place. Incidentally, and just plugging, I forgot, we're still selling the Hillary
[50:56.720 --> 51:01.600]  for prison charts for $9.95. That includes shipping. So that's at cost. $9.95. Shipping
[51:01.600 --> 51:05.040]  included. No more shipping. We're limited time, though, because we are selling out of
[51:05.040 --> 51:09.600]  them very, very quickly. And you get a couple free Hillary for prison stickers with each
[51:09.600 --> 51:13.440]  order and a pocket constitution. So I just realized I'm losing money on that probably.
[51:13.440 --> 51:17.120]  Yeah, like a 50 cent pocket constitution, a couple bumper stickers that are eight cents
[51:17.120 --> 51:21.880]  apiece. Yeah, that's like almost 70 cents on top of that. We're losing money. This is
[51:21.880 --> 51:26.560]  a lost leader. Hillary for prison. I just want to get them out there everywhere. Info
[51:26.560 --> 51:32.480]  or store.com or call toll three, eight, eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[51:32.480 --> 51:37.320]  This is a revolution. This is an info war. This is about visibility. If you've got the
[51:37.320 --> 51:40.440]  funds, I would get them for everybody in your office, everybody, you know, people in your
[51:40.440 --> 51:44.480]  church, it's time to get aggressive, folks. You're not going to find a shirt with shipping
[51:44.480 --> 51:49.200]  included lower than this. Hillary for prison. We've got some other T shirts as well like
[51:49.200 --> 51:54.240]  Molan Labe. They're all excellent. Okay, I'm going to stop plugging. Let's go back to
[51:54.240 --> 51:58.440]  Hillary and her coughing fit where she says just pause for long periods of time. Here
[51:58.440 --> 52:16.280]  it is. Well, emblematic of collapse. Otherwise you hear not doing well. Something's going
[52:16.280 --> 52:21.680]  on there, folks. They think we're so dumb. They're just going to put her up there on
[52:21.680 --> 52:27.920]  TV. 62 days. They tell her everything's okay. Well, you just heard the next vice president,
[52:27.920 --> 52:40.400]  didn't you? He's not the vice president yet. In addition to thanking Marsha Fudge. So thank
[52:40.400 --> 52:45.840]  your great senator, Sharon Brown. It pause for a minute. We're not editing the video.
[52:45.840 --> 52:50.480]  That's just a glitch. Now understand, folks, they think you're stupid and they can just
[52:50.480 --> 52:55.280]  get this across the finish line. And then who knows what can happen then. I'll tell
[52:55.280 --> 53:00.880]  you, Kane who's behind her who's just as nasty as she is and just as owned by the globalist
[53:00.880 --> 53:08.760]  is just sitting there hoping the corpse. Weekend with Hillary can get across that finish line.
[53:08.760 --> 53:14.440]  They are in a race with the devil and I'm telling you they're losing. Look at her and
[53:14.440 --> 53:19.000]  she's honking. She's sucking air. She looks like she's about to collapse. She can barely
[53:19.000 --> 53:24.400]  stand up. She looks like she's dizzy. She's stumbling around and whenever people sit
[53:24.400 --> 53:29.960]  there and say something to her in the crowd, she looks like she's about to go crazy and
[53:29.960 --> 53:36.800]  a doctor with an injector pin runs up next to her. The conservative review gives Senator
[53:36.800 --> 53:42.120]  Tim Kane an F or a zero score for Liberty. But it's okay because you're going to vote
[53:42.120 --> 53:48.680]  for the guy that wants open borders and bans on all rifles above five rounds in the magazine
[53:48.680 --> 53:54.380]  and who supports the TPP, Gary, I love Hillary Johnson. Let's go ahead and go back to the
[53:54.380 --> 53:58.520]  uh, coughing fits of, uh, hitlery.
[53:58.520 --> 54:11.140]  Excuse me, just handed her something else, another drug. Also, two other great members
[54:11.140 --> 54:17.200]  of Congress. Tim Ryan enjoys Haiti. Oh, she is struggling with every bit of her hateful
[54:17.200 --> 54:23.560]  will to hold those cops back. She can't help it. Your mayor, thanks to Mayor Jackson.
[54:23.560 --> 54:30.560]  I guarantee you, she's on drugs to keep her larynx calm. Guarantee you those laws are
[54:30.560 --> 54:45.520]  opiate based that Ohio will send Ted Strickland to the Senate. Now behind me are some of the
[54:45.520 --> 55:00.900]  great labor leaders of our country. Randy Winegarden, Lee Saunders, and Trump. I'm proud to be on
[55:00.900 --> 55:12.940]  the same stage with them because they're always fighting for working families. Now, as I get
[55:12.940 --> 55:25.120]  over my allergic reaction, let me say that we're here in part because we know how important
[55:25.120 --> 55:26.920]  this election is to Ohio.
[55:26.920 --> 55:31.120]  Uh, listen, I can't put up with this. That's enough. That's enough. Stop. Stop. It's not
[55:31.120 --> 55:36.000]  just that's enough. It goes on for a lot longer. Now, let's go to her in her so-called press
[55:36.000 --> 55:41.880]  conference. If you're a radio listener, there's like eight sycophantic women looking at her
[55:41.880 --> 55:50.720]  like she is Jesus returned to earth. I mean, they're looking at her like fawning communist
[55:50.720 --> 55:56.920]  slaves looking at Kim Jong-un in North Korea. And then she basically has a coughing fit
[55:56.920 --> 56:00.960]  and has to stop that press conference. And then she doubles down again and pops up about
[56:00.960 --> 56:07.280]  a conspiracy theory about her health and starts to begin coughing and has to stop that. So
[56:07.280 --> 56:13.720]  God is basically taking the power of speech away from this woman. But oh, she's not sick.
[56:13.720 --> 56:17.800]  There's no problem. Let's go ahead and go to her on the aircraft.
[56:17.800 --> 56:26.760]  And look, he very early on allied himself with Putin's policies. I mean, to pull out
[56:26.760 --> 56:34.120]  of NATO for business sakes, right? And he furthermore has praised Putin. He seems to
[56:34.120 --> 56:41.480]  have this bizarre attraction to dictators, including Putin. He won't tell us where he
[56:41.480 --> 56:53.400]  owes $650 million. There's a lot of rumors about that. And he has made it clear that
[56:53.400 --> 57:00.280]  he doesn't particularly care whether Putin and the intelligence services attack American
[57:00.280 --> 57:08.800]  institutions. So it gets worse and she has to stop. That's enough. The full videos up
[57:08.800 --> 57:13.240]  on infowors.com. And this is a whole other area I didn't even get into today. The White
[57:13.240 --> 57:17.840]  House over the weekend, Obama came out and officially said that he's going to take over
[57:17.840 --> 57:22.960]  the elections to protect us from the Russians. So don't worry about Obama and the globalists
[57:22.960 --> 57:27.640]  and the communist Chinese basically run our government. The Russians that have the GDP
[57:27.640 --> 57:33.360]  of Italy, they now are running Trump. Yours truly everybody. She said that in her speech
[57:33.360 --> 57:39.520]  a few weeks ago on the alt right, remember? Well, now I guess Putin's causing those coughing
[57:39.520 --> 57:45.360]  fits as well. Now they're going to have to bring in federal and international watchers
[57:45.360 --> 57:53.320]  and control everything with Jed Johnson because of the Russians. And then she went further
[57:53.320 --> 57:57.040]  and she had to cancel this little speech. So later I guess she had enough medication.
[57:57.040 --> 58:00.360]  She scurried back out for this quick clip as we go to break where she talked about the
[58:00.360 --> 58:06.800]  conspiracy theorist. Here's that. Are you concerned about conspiracy theories about
[58:06.800 --> 58:10.240]  your health and whether that will affect the election? And are you concerned separately
[58:10.240 --> 58:16.200]  about the tightening polls with Donald Trump? I'm not concerned about the conspiracy theories.
[58:16.200 --> 58:20.680]  There are so many of them, I've lost track of them. And so I pay no attention to them.
[58:20.680 --> 58:25.080]  I've always thought this was going to be a close race. That's the history of modern.
[58:25.080 --> 58:30.800]  So questioning a known liar who spent a year in a hospital, you know, you're not, again,
[58:30.800 --> 58:36.520]  she has a magic word, conspiracy theory. Yep, we'll be back to stay with us. Second
[58:36.520 --> 58:53.000]  hour. Here's Hillary's new song. Listen to me because I'm about to point out three things

[1:00:03.960 --> 1:00:30.360]  and disinformation. It's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. So, just to pen a shot
[1:00:30.360 --> 1:00:35.120]  of you joining us, Hillary Clinton had three different coughing fits yesterday. She had
[1:00:35.120 --> 1:00:39.260]  to basically cancel a speech early, cancel one of her first press conferences in almost
[1:00:39.260 --> 1:00:48.520]  a year with a bunch of sycophants on board treason aircraft or witch one or demon one
[1:00:48.520 --> 1:00:53.700]  or Banshee one, whatever name she's given it. And then she also started talking about
[1:00:53.700 --> 1:00:58.260]  conspiracy theorists and had to choke back coughs there as well. So, we're going to actually
[1:00:58.260 --> 1:01:02.340]  dense all this down probably by the end of the show just a few of her coughs here a few of the
[1:01:02.340 --> 1:01:07.380]  coughs there and then mixing in with her saying uh there's a conspiracy theory but then she starts
[1:01:07.380 --> 1:01:12.500]  starts coughing uh as well which is associated I don't know why no one's done this article
[1:01:13.220 --> 1:01:17.540]  Zach just popped in my ear during the break and we'll put it on screen and said you know
[1:01:17.540 --> 1:01:22.660]  this is a sign of congenital heart failure and everybody knows that he's had family that's had
[1:01:22.660 --> 1:01:27.780]  heart problems or you've seen the movie the godfather you know where the godfather starts
[1:01:27.780 --> 1:01:31.460]  having a heart attack he first starts coughing you know in the in the back of the garden with
[1:01:31.460 --> 1:01:36.340]  with the grandson I mean everybody's always known that many heart attacks are associated
[1:01:36.340 --> 1:01:41.540]  and heart problems are associated with coughing fits and the old timers would take nitroglycerin
[1:01:41.540 --> 1:01:47.540]  to get their heart jumping again and they would you know start coughing and so pop one of those
[1:01:48.100 --> 1:01:52.100]  so we'll put that article that you were just talking about on screen Zach and we can show people
[1:01:52.100 --> 1:02:00.180]  what we were just talking about uh or it's up on drugs I guess I can go there um everyday health
[1:02:00.180 --> 1:02:06.580]  and you scroll down how too much thyroid hormone affects your heart an overactive thyroid gland
[1:02:06.580 --> 1:02:13.540]  hyperthyroidism can cause the irregular heartbeat or atrial fibrillation the thyroid which is a small
[1:02:13.540 --> 1:02:19.380]  gland in your neck could throw your heart out of its natural rhythm and increase your risk of
[1:02:19.380 --> 1:02:26.260]  heart failure or stroke that is because thyroid hormone has a profound effect on the heart's function
[1:02:27.140 --> 1:02:34.100]  and may cause atrial fibrillation but that doesn't matter doesn't matter that 2.7 million Americans
[1:02:34.100 --> 1:02:39.620]  suffer from and according to the national heart association doesn't matter that Hillary's got
[1:02:39.620 --> 1:02:46.420]  all these medical problems and cardiovascular problems and is on drugs for hyperthyroidism
[1:02:46.420 --> 1:02:52.340]  when medical doctors bring it up on CNN they get fired a few days later and then I get
[1:02:52.340 --> 1:02:59.620]  attacked on the national news is having a dark heart and then I'm some big evil deceiver very
[1:02:59.620 --> 1:03:04.740]  well reports the surprising way Hillary Clinton treats her thyroid condition and that's what
[1:03:04.740 --> 1:03:11.060]  dr drew said he said taking armor thyroid from the 40s and 50s that hasn't been subscribed since
[1:03:11.060 --> 1:03:17.380]  the 60s is unheard of and he said taking it with cumulon which is rat poison is insane
[1:03:18.500 --> 1:03:24.900]  and that the two counteract each other with devastating effects so the plot thickens the
[1:03:24.900 --> 1:03:30.180]  truth is I've talked to medical doctors about this we've got one coming on later no one really knows
[1:03:31.460 --> 1:03:37.460]  what condition you take these things with but so you don't you don't question that though because
[1:03:37.460 --> 1:03:45.460]  Hillary said so hyperthyroidism which she admittedly has is an overactive thyroid which
[1:03:45.460 --> 1:03:49.940]  is caused in many Americans by fluoride in the water that's admitted sentence can include a slow
[1:03:50.580 --> 1:03:57.380]  metabolic system fatigue weight gain and other issues and Hillary Clinton fits the
[1:03:57.380 --> 1:04:04.980]  bill of what she admittedly has that then gives you heart problems and when you start having
[1:04:04.980 --> 1:04:10.420]  that happen with your heart it's connected to everything else and you start coughing you start
[1:04:10.420 --> 1:04:18.740]  hacking you start having problems but I'm sorry we're not allowed to talk about that because
[1:04:18.740 --> 1:04:23.860]  Hillary and the national press controls reality and they said that's just the way it is well the
[1:04:23.860 --> 1:04:29.860]  truth is it's not just the way it is and reality is catching up Hillary Clinton is crashing and
[1:04:29.860 --> 1:04:41.540]  burning it's very poignant it's it's very apropos it's a symbol of the rotting corrupt
[1:04:41.540 --> 1:04:47.540]  arrogant system that would even try to run someone like this and then even as she collapses
[1:04:47.540 --> 1:04:54.260]  close to the finish line after stealing the nomination from Bernie Sanders he still arrogantly
[1:04:54.260 --> 1:05:01.860]  crawls forward like a giant squirm jump eggs here with info wars dot com with an update on
[1:05:01.860 --> 1:05:07.940]  unhealthy Hillary Hillary Clinton says conspiracy theories about her health not a concern sorry but

[1:09:08.340 --> 1:09:15.460]  and globalist management and i'm going to air that report coming up after mr nickles leaves us

[1:09:31.460 --> 1:09:39.220]  video and audio feeds and more and nickles was in black ops secret of operations uh he was basically
[1:09:39.220 --> 1:09:48.260]  assigned to the clintons when they ran for the governorship as to cia operatives this has all
[1:09:48.260 --> 1:09:52.580]  been partially declassified it's the only reason i can talk about it our people releasing the
[1:09:52.580 --> 1:09:57.540]  information would be killed but they were hand we even know the name of their handler in london
[1:09:57.540 --> 1:10:02.580]  when they were first on that desk they were also sent into russia but without getting into a long
[1:10:02.580 --> 1:10:08.260]  story short here i've interviewed the cia flight commanders that were running the operations at
[1:10:08.260 --> 1:10:12.980]  mean up terry reid i've interviewed the people that were in country i've interviewed the people
[1:10:12.980 --> 1:10:17.060]  that worked for them i've interviewed basically everybody and one of the key folks that helped
[1:10:17.060 --> 1:10:23.460]  all these dominos come down is larry nickles now larry said a year and a half ago hillary
[1:10:23.460 --> 1:10:29.620]  will not be indicted for the emails and she wasn't he said that she's gonna play this health stuff
[1:10:29.620 --> 1:10:34.900]  up he said that a year ago and that uh it's to make her look like an underdog now i want to say
[1:10:34.900 --> 1:10:40.020]  that i respect larry and he's been proven right nine times out of ten but she looks like hell i mean
[1:10:40.020 --> 1:10:45.460]  even the best costume design even the best uh hollywood makeup folks uh it's hard to make you
[1:10:45.460 --> 1:10:51.060]  look this sick when you really are this sick is she really sick or are they playing up to it um
[1:10:51.060 --> 1:10:55.540]  why would she be having speeches where she hacks and coughs and can't even talk i mean
[1:10:55.540 --> 1:10:59.380]  if this is a strategy i want them to continue it because it's hurting her in my view uh trump
[1:10:59.380 --> 1:11:04.660]  is even in polls that are twisted where they're adding 10 to 15 percent more democrats is beating
[1:11:04.660 --> 1:11:09.220]  her i see that the street all over the country we go to democrat areas and we can't find people
[1:11:09.940 --> 1:11:14.180]  and it's very hard i mean nine out of ten eight out of ten depending on where we're at
[1:11:14.180 --> 1:11:21.700]  democrats say they don't like hillard like a lot of them hate her more than they hate trump like a
[1:11:21.700 --> 1:11:28.020]  lot of democrats are going away i used to like him wait a minute didn't he you know for equal rights
[1:11:28.020 --> 1:11:34.260]  and all this stuff so i don't want to sit here and and and go with this gospel what larry's saying
[1:11:34.260 --> 1:11:40.180]  but i also don't just have people on i agree with and i want to be clear we try to have people on
[1:11:40.180 --> 1:11:44.820]  we disagree with all the time they're usually cowards and we'll do it even offer bounties to
[1:11:44.820 --> 1:11:50.260]  people and they're scared to do it i'm not saying i disagree with nickles though we're having an open
[1:11:50.260 --> 1:11:56.340]  free forum debate so many listeners comment on info wars they go what is this one day you got
[1:11:56.340 --> 1:12:01.700]  somebody on saying this and the next day you got somebody's on saying that the that's the whole point
[1:12:01.700 --> 1:12:13.700]  is that i'll have on you know somebody like dent who disagrees with somebody like schiff but but
[1:12:13.700 --> 1:12:19.220]  overall their predictions are 90 plus accurate now we're getting down to the end game we're
[1:12:19.220 --> 1:12:27.460]  going to see whether it's inflation uh like one of them has been saying or or not and we've got
[1:12:27.460 --> 1:12:31.860]  that economic news today and i'll tell you something else that larry nickles said and i'm not talking
[1:12:31.860 --> 1:12:35.140]  about this to talk about larry nickles it all feeds into what's currently happening
[1:12:37.620 --> 1:12:42.260]  russia and saudi arabia are discussing oil production freeze russian energy ministers said
[1:12:42.260 --> 1:12:47.540]  that over the weekend and then today boom oil prices jump after russia and saudi arabia create
[1:12:47.540 --> 1:12:55.140]  margastability task force treasuries climb dollar falls traders trim fed hike wagers that's financial
[1:12:55.140 --> 1:13:01.060]  times of london it was about i don't know four months ago larry said get ready and watch the
[1:13:01.060 --> 1:13:04.740]  german banks it could be a month from now it could be six months from now well then they
[1:13:04.740 --> 1:13:09.060]  tried to come out in the last month and saying the german banks to completely go under many times
[1:13:09.060 --> 1:13:15.220]  better than leman brothers two weeks ago or we can half go to be technical they told um german
[1:13:15.220 --> 1:13:20.100]  citizens in in major newspapers they said get prepared for a total emergency they won't say what
[1:13:20.100 --> 1:13:26.420]  what so a lot of craziness is going on right now obama was received for the first time ever
[1:13:27.540 --> 1:13:32.580]  as a major head of state going to another major nation at the back of the plane the chinese
[1:13:32.580 --> 1:13:38.420]  told him you come off here uh his minion got off and said what are you doing to us and they said
[1:13:38.420 --> 1:13:46.260]  this is our airport our country the chinese you know official getting in her face no red carpet
[1:13:46.260 --> 1:13:55.220]  so what on earth is going on here these are all symbols to the world of what china thinks
[1:13:55.220 --> 1:14:02.740]  of the us and it's public the united states run by globalist made deals to give them the rare earth
[1:14:02.740 --> 1:14:08.260]  minerals worldwide production rights deep water ports the panama canal but the chinese were not
[1:14:08.260 --> 1:14:16.740]  to militarily get out of their sphere not as far as japan to the north and and and uh to the east
[1:14:16.740 --> 1:14:21.300]  not as far south uh as the philippines the chinese have broke that deal
[1:14:23.540 --> 1:14:28.260]  they've broken their deal just like hitler and and you know stalling breaking deals with each other
[1:14:28.260 --> 1:14:32.820]  and now all hell's breaking loose uh joining us is larry nickles larry thank you for coming on
[1:14:32.820 --> 1:14:37.380]  with us we appreciate you my friend i know you're only on phone today i hope you're doing well uh

[1:14:48.500 --> 1:14:54.820]  tell us uh where you want to start first oh my god alex number one let me get it right out in the
[1:14:54.820 --> 1:15:03.300]  open folks i'm no clairvoyant i'm no prophet none of that alex going first where you were talking
[1:15:03.300 --> 1:15:09.700]  about hillary's health issue remember what i've said as i hadn't been with those people in what
[1:15:09.700 --> 1:15:17.380]  20 30 years i'm not in on the meetings what i do know is what they're trained to do so if
[1:15:18.180 --> 1:15:24.340]  she sees an opening with this medical issue she's going to use it now is she really sick i'm like
[1:15:24.340 --> 1:15:29.140]  you alex is she really sick it's kind of looking like the lady's got something or the animal i'm
[1:15:29.140 --> 1:15:36.260]  going to say lady's got a problem she will milk it for everything she can but she said something
[1:15:36.260 --> 1:15:43.780]  else that makes that's incredibly important you said that as y'all have gone around in the black
[1:15:43.780 --> 1:15:49.300]  communities etc throughout the country you haven't found anybody that's all for hillary let me tell
[1:15:49.300 --> 1:15:55.060]  you something for years and years you know this has happened in arkansas for years you could go
[1:15:55.060 --> 1:16:04.340]  around the state and after an election nobody voted for bill clinton however he won how you do that
[1:16:05.220 --> 1:16:10.420]  well that's that's what we're going to the next vice president i'll keep going we're playing
[1:16:10.420 --> 1:16:16.500]  some hillary in the background go ahead well the biggest thing that we have to face today
[1:16:16.500 --> 1:16:27.300]  is organized mass multiple voting and that's why alex all over the country you're seeing this voter
[1:16:27.300 --> 1:16:33.780]  id states have passed voter id laws and now they've got the justice department in there saying they're
[1:16:33.780 --> 1:16:38.180]  going to sue try in fact thank god you just remind me that's why i wanted to get you on last week
[1:16:38.180 --> 1:16:42.260]  and you're only able to come on this week larry obama says a month ago there's no such thing as
[1:16:42.260 --> 1:16:48.580]  election fraud now he announces massive fraud by the republicans quote run by the putin incredible
[1:16:48.580 --> 1:16:53.540]  conspiracy theory so they're going to federalize everything and hook federal computers up to all
[1:16:53.540 --> 1:17:00.020]  the machines to save us how insanely obvious is this larry oh man well you know here again guys
[1:17:00.660 --> 1:17:06.420]  this is the big one i hope people understand alex we're playing a game today and i hate to call it
[1:17:06.420 --> 1:17:13.620]  a game but we're in a fight for our lives as a nation we're in a fight for it it's amazing to me
[1:17:13.620 --> 1:17:18.340]  that you've got states that go through their constitutional requirements and put something
[1:17:18.340 --> 1:17:24.180]  on the ballot the state legislature ratifies it the governor signs it and then they have a law
[1:17:25.300 --> 1:17:30.820]  and then the first thing that happens with this law rightfully and duly passed by the state
[1:17:30.820 --> 1:17:38.340]  a federal judge says no you can't do it unbelievable and it happens every day you know in north
[1:17:38.340 --> 1:17:44.180]  carolina as an example we're trying to work to get people to help that governor in north carolina
[1:17:44.900 --> 1:17:52.180]  you've got to have a picture id to get alcohol you got to have a picture absolutely so so they
[1:17:52.180 --> 1:17:57.460]  want to have dead people vote other people vote um they have a list of old voter rolls people
[1:17:57.460 --> 1:18:01.860]  still in the voter rolls but who haven't voted a while there's going to be massive fraud now do
[1:18:01.860 --> 1:18:06.500]  you know why that's so important when i was with bill clinton now folks this is a long time ago but
[1:18:06.500 --> 1:18:11.460]  it's going to happen today we used to go to ward school bus here in conway and we used to get school
[1:18:11.460 --> 1:18:16.340]  buses during the summer we'd get school buses and we would load them up we would go to northeast
[1:18:16.340 --> 1:18:24.180]  arkansas we'd pick up in that impoverished area of the state we would pick up black we would take
[1:18:24.180 --> 1:18:30.180]  them to the precincts in little rock kind of what you'd call the ghetto precincts we would get them a
[1:18:30.180 --> 1:18:36.100]  t-shirt they'd go in with this card and it would say hello i'm larry nickles and then it showed
[1:18:36.100 --> 1:18:42.900]  them exactly who to vote for they go in they vote they come back out alex we changed their t-shirt
[1:18:42.900 --> 1:18:48.500]  now they got a blue t-shirt on they go back in except this time instead of larry nickles he's alex
[1:18:48.500 --> 1:18:54.820]  jones he knows how to vote he fills it out he comes back on gets on the bus changes t-shirts
[1:18:54.820 --> 1:18:59.780]  goes back in votes again that's why we've got to be looking for the buses and we've got to dress up
[1:18:59.780 --> 1:19:07.140]  like bums as well and stumble on to them and blow their operations now there you go now the problem
[1:19:07.140 --> 1:19:13.540]  is folks all these people say well i'll be a poll watcher well let me tell you where the problem is
[1:19:13.540 --> 1:19:19.700]  guys let me tell you where the massive voter frog is going to be it's going to be in cleveland
[1:19:19.700 --> 1:19:24.260]  it's going to be in detour it's going to be in new york it's going to be wherever there are
[1:19:25.060 --> 1:19:31.540]  what do you call them ghetto communities large numbers that's where you got to go stay right

[1:24:03.300 --> 1:24:08.100]  you know i realize that i'm almost like a rabid barking dog half the time on the show because
[1:24:08.100 --> 1:24:14.660]  i've had so much information so much i want to get out and then so much frustration not in my
[1:24:14.660 --> 1:24:20.020]  crew they're amazing just to myself that it's worse than i'm saying and it's so transparent
[1:24:20.020 --> 1:24:25.220]  and if the people would open their eyes it could all end what was it four four and a half weeks ago
[1:24:25.220 --> 1:24:30.980]  i come out put on a case for election fraud in the last election in the primaries robbing bernie
[1:24:30.980 --> 1:24:36.020]  sanders trying to rob trump i show the clips i show the history of fraud in a little short six
[1:24:36.020 --> 1:24:42.020]  minute video i asked donald trump to investigate it he's already investigating it he comes out a
[1:24:42.020 --> 1:24:49.860]  few days later and basically breaks down the facts not repeating what i said but repeating the facts
[1:24:51.220 --> 1:24:57.620]  they call facts conspiracy theories it's a fact stanford research institute came out a month ago
[1:24:57.620 --> 1:25:04.100]  and said bernie sanders was robbed he should have been the nominee he won well i don't need stanford
[1:25:04.100 --> 1:25:11.380]  research i was there watching fraud per state it was in cnn dot com it was it was in the new york
[1:25:11.380 --> 1:25:19.140]  daily news that they met the day before in california and and and decided who the delegates were
[1:25:19.140 --> 1:25:24.500]  going to go for didn't matter they had the the election the next day that is earth shaking
[1:25:27.860 --> 1:25:32.020]  so then obama comes out and addresses oh the conspiracy theory from texas not even saying my
[1:25:32.020 --> 1:25:38.260]  name and tells the press corps it doesn't exist there's no such thing as election fraud but now
[1:25:38.260 --> 1:25:44.900]  it blew up in their face a month later they're now all over the news saying russians are in our
[1:25:44.900 --> 1:25:49.300]  computers that they're in them they're in the election computers and they've got to be stopped so
[1:25:49.300 --> 1:25:53.620]  homeland security that's the offshore globalist that's you really took the country over they're
[1:25:53.620 --> 1:26:00.020]  going to protect us from the russians by taking over the election sin sational and then here's a
[1:26:00.020 --> 1:26:05.220]  clip of hillary yesterday before she had to stop her fake press conference with a few of her friends
[1:26:05.220 --> 1:26:12.260]  hacking talking about the russians in our election so which way is it here it is he furthermore has
[1:26:12.260 --> 1:26:19.940]  praised budan he seems to have this bizarre attraction to dictators including budan he won't
[1:26:19.940 --> 1:26:31.620]  tell us where he owes 650 million dollars there's a lot of rumors about that and he has you know
[1:26:31.620 --> 1:26:38.580]  made it clear that um he doesn't particularly care whether budan and the intelligence services
[1:26:38.580 --> 1:26:51.220]  attack american institutions so she's the one attacking american institutions
[1:26:53.460 --> 1:26:56.900]  and then she goes on to say they're getting involved in the elections we have to do something
[1:26:56.900 --> 1:27:01.540]  about it i'll cue it up during the break and we'll play it uh but the point is that this is a big
[1:27:01.540 --> 1:27:07.620]  deal now larry nichols is our gas will hold him some into the next segment but larry what are we
[1:27:07.620 --> 1:27:12.980]  seeing here from your inside political eye knowing the clinton's denying election fraud
[1:27:12.980 --> 1:27:17.620]  shank it doesn't exist but now having homeland security come in and take over elections all right
[1:27:17.620 --> 1:27:23.700]  alex it's simple one of the rules that we always had this is a fun foundational principle with the
[1:27:23.700 --> 1:27:33.220]  clinton's you always accuse your opponent of what you're doing always now what that means is when i
[1:27:33.220 --> 1:27:40.660]  accuse you alex of something that i'm doing guess what i know all the angles so i can tell all kinds
[1:27:40.660 --> 1:27:50.180]  of stuff in detail that nobody could possibly know so it proves my point about you when i've got all
[1:27:50.180 --> 1:27:57.700]  of these exacting details number one but the scariest thing of all they're using this they're
[1:27:57.700 --> 1:28:06.020]  using this as a way to do what bring in somebody to oversee it and who controls the people that
[1:28:06.020 --> 1:28:18.580]  are going to be overseeing it they do they do so it's an absolute unbelievable play to get absolute

[1:36:54.100 --> 1:36:59.380]  very clear not just here but all over the world whether it's internet censorship or control
[1:37:00.420 --> 1:37:07.460]  or targeted assassinations or globalists not even fixing nuclear reactors that are leaking
[1:37:07.460 --> 1:37:15.060]  or power grabbing media censorship the media lap dogs going further than other censoring
[1:37:15.060 --> 1:37:20.180]  all hades it seems is breaking loose and it was already accelerating but it seemed like
[1:37:20.820 --> 1:37:26.500]  we passed a demarcation line september first and everything we already saw that was amplified
[1:37:26.500 --> 1:37:33.300]  a hundred percent last year went up 200 more i mean it was like just a massive next level
[1:37:33.300 --> 1:37:38.420]  and and now it's clear the acceleration is clearly happening what are we witnessing larry nickles
[1:37:39.620 --> 1:37:44.660]  you're witnessing what i told you about alex months few months ago remember when i was telling
[1:37:44.660 --> 1:37:54.580]  you and your listeners we're at the beginning of the beginning of the end of the silent coup

[1:38:01.220 --> 1:38:05.940]  someone interrupt everything for just a second folks i'm telling you this is straightforward
[1:38:05.940 --> 1:38:11.620]  and honest as i can i appreciate alex and all of y'all trying to help me but if it comes down

[1:38:41.860 --> 1:38:48.100]  for all of you now let me tell you something alex that's coming number one people need to come here
[1:38:48.100 --> 1:38:53.220]  because i will help you you know i've rigged more elections alex than most people have voted in
[1:38:53.220 --> 1:38:59.700]  i've done it i've rigged them i admit it i'm proud of it but i did it it's because i did that i know
[1:38:59.700 --> 1:39:06.020]  how to twiddle with them and save them we're gonna have a program right here alex if people will
[1:39:06.020 --> 1:39:14.260]  come showing how to do pole watching to the point where we can stop this massive single greatest
[1:39:14.260 --> 1:39:21.700]  effort they have to rig this election which is the multiple voting that we can stop alex we can
[1:39:21.700 --> 1:39:27.300]  stop it with your audience right here if people will come here and let's teach them intro how to
[1:39:27.300 --> 1:39:37.300]  do it number one number two in that ppp there's another little thing there are 29 facts about tpp
[1:39:38.180 --> 1:39:43.460]  five of them have to do with the trade which is what we think it's supposed to be about right
[1:39:43.460 --> 1:39:53.300]  only five have to do a trade 24 others have to do with stuff that ain't got nothing to do a trade
[1:39:53.300 --> 1:40:00.260]  number one would be like the computer stuff october the first but here's the scary one
[1:40:01.620 --> 1:40:09.220]  i have told y'all that obama announced himself they said it i didn't the obama people said a couple
[1:40:09.220 --> 1:40:16.020]  three months ago that on november the 15th or the 17th i can't remember why i can't tell you which one
[1:40:16.020 --> 1:40:25.860]  date it was but on that day full obama care kicks in and when full obama care kicks in your health
[1:40:25.860 --> 1:40:41.060]  care insurance premium they said well go up somewhere between 200 to 2000 percent 200 to 2000
[1:40:41.060 --> 1:40:48.580]  percent well i found out last week alex knows who i found out but i can't tell y'all because of
[1:40:48.580 --> 1:41:00.100]  the risk but included in tpp it includes a provision having to do with the american health care
[1:41:01.140 --> 1:41:10.740]  program but what they're talking about is obama care global health care system
[1:41:10.740 --> 1:41:22.420]  of the establishment of a global health care plan and what that means alex is we in america
[1:41:23.460 --> 1:41:31.140]  are going to be picking up the tab now remember under obama care the problem is by the time we
[1:41:31.140 --> 1:41:37.380]  pick up the tab for all the people that choose not to have health care or can't afford it it's
[1:41:37.380 --> 1:41:45.540]  bankrupting us when now we're going to find out the 15th of november that we're fixing to pick up
[1:41:45.540 --> 1:41:52.740]  under the terms of this union agreement we're fixing to pick up the health care costs for zimbabwe
[1:41:52.740 --> 1:42:02.020]  kenya you name nowhere country in the world we're picking it all up it will literally drive us into
[1:42:02.020 --> 1:42:15.700]  bankruptcy us us now we gotta stop that alex absolutely look at venezuela look at what's
[1:42:15.700 --> 1:42:20.580]  happening all over the world look at greece look at spain look at portugal look at italy they are
[1:42:20.580 --> 1:42:27.460]  installing leaders uh in major european countries and it's on the news that quote goldman sacks
[1:42:27.460 --> 1:42:32.820]  runs our country now and every time you turn around it's goldman sacks whether it's gun control
[1:42:32.820 --> 1:42:39.380]  open borders globalism it is this one bank along with jp morgan chase that run the whole stinkin
[1:42:39.380 --> 1:42:45.300]  show and do you think they're being truthful when they say in the financial times and the
[1:42:45.300 --> 1:42:50.340]  economists and the washington posts obviously communicating with their own crew members that
[1:42:50.340 --> 1:42:54.420]  the new world order is in deep trouble if hillary doesn't win i mean i mean are they all in for her
[1:42:54.420 --> 1:42:58.980]  because if they'll censor if they'll engage in all these threats if they'll let her commit all
[1:42:58.980 --> 1:43:05.940]  these crimes clearly she is the embodiment of their hubs and dreams i believe without any
[1:43:05.940 --> 1:43:12.100]  shadow of a doubt now this is my belief i cannot prove this in the court of law this is my feeling
[1:43:13.140 --> 1:43:20.340]  they have fought so very hard against donald trump because donald trump they fear
[1:43:20.340 --> 1:43:28.340]  is about america and whoever becomes president of the united states to comply with this global
[1:43:28.340 --> 1:43:36.900]  one world global governance system you cannot have a person that the presidency of this country
[1:43:36.900 --> 1:43:43.700]  that believes in america first you can't you can't do it it don't work they have got to stop trump
[1:43:43.700 --> 1:43:50.580]  and if they stop trump they stop us that's hillary strength and she knows that hillary's
[1:43:50.580 --> 1:43:56.500]  setting back alex she's on a dream ride of her life she's sitting here with all these global
[1:43:56.500 --> 1:44:02.020]  interests that are sitting there worried oh she's got to do just set back and let them do all the
[1:44:02.020 --> 1:44:08.020]  work let me give you another quick example remember what is the greatest single fraud
[1:44:08.020 --> 1:44:13.460]  committed against american people when it comes to this election and that's going to be the multiple
[1:44:13.460 --> 1:44:24.660]  voting several states have introduced voter id laws now figure this one out alex we find
[1:44:24.660 --> 1:44:32.500]  out a couple of weeks ago or a month ago whenever it was that george soros had committed along with
[1:44:32.500 --> 1:44:40.020]  the d and c they had committed to this law firm a guy named liason or ellison however he pronounces
[1:44:40.020 --> 1:44:43.540]  that sure sure i mean let me quantify it it's in all the emails that they said we're going to bring
[1:44:43.540 --> 1:44:47.300]  in foreigners and get illegals to vote and this is how we're going to break the us up it's the same
[1:44:47.300 --> 1:44:53.220]  strategy in europe we have his emails there as well and they're going to put in three million
[1:44:53.220 --> 1:45:03.220]  dollars for him to go around doing and to fight get this to fight yeah globalism for very simple
[1:45:03.220 --> 1:45:07.460]  equations it's a very simple equation foreign multinational banks come in they open your
[1:45:07.460 --> 1:45:11.780]  borders they bring in client minority groups that then vote in key areas and demographics
[1:45:11.780 --> 1:45:15.380]  in battleground states to overthrow the country uh it's not that we're even against these poor
[1:45:15.380 --> 1:45:20.180]  illegals it's that they are a weapon system just like if you know you know drowned you know your
[1:45:20.180 --> 1:45:24.900]  dog in a pool of water the water isn't you know evil itself but but it's being used as a weapon
[1:45:24.900 --> 1:45:30.820]  you're absolutely right larry you helped them form the broken coalition strategy and we are now
[1:45:30.820 --> 1:45:36.340]  witnessing at point blank range my friend well you got to see this one little trick because it's
[1:45:36.340 --> 1:45:41.620]  deadly they're going out with us a line through group and they're funding two things they gave
[1:45:41.620 --> 1:45:52.340]  them two orders fight number one voter ideologues why because that allows for multiple voting but
[1:45:52.340 --> 1:45:57.460]  the other thing that they're giving him money for is to fight what alex they're giving him
[1:45:57.460 --> 1:46:05.460]  money to fight states rights initiatives state rights why well think about it they've got us in
[1:46:05.460 --> 1:46:11.300]  the court any state i've told everybody i can to tell their governor you go in federal court
[1:46:11.300 --> 1:46:15.700]  you've lost you're in with the black the states just have to ignore it now the courts at the
[1:46:15.700 --> 1:46:19.300]  federal level are gone we have to go with the states and we have to reconstitute the republic
[1:46:19.300 --> 1:46:23.220]  in a new constitutional convention there you go with the states and i was never for a concon
[1:46:23.220 --> 1:46:28.500]  because they could use it to overthrow us they already have we are in an emergency brain surgery
[1:46:28.500 --> 1:46:32.660]  heart surgery right now we have got to save this country and here's the good news and i want to add
[1:46:32.660 --> 1:46:38.100]  this here larry they came to totally overrun the uk with globalist tyranny the people voted to
[1:46:38.100 --> 1:46:42.420]  leave it doesn't mean the fight's over but they're going in the right direction donald trump has risen
[1:46:42.420 --> 1:46:47.460]  up uh in in opposition as the bible says when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of the
[1:46:47.460 --> 1:46:53.620]  lord will lift up a standard against it so the good news is that you can see nationalism and the
[1:46:53.620 --> 1:46:58.260]  understanding of the new world order growing and expanding larry and that really scares the new
[1:46:58.260 --> 1:47:03.460]  world order and is making them accelerate their plan that was already in trouble and i believe
[1:47:03.460 --> 1:47:08.420]  they've miscalculated and are starting to bleed out and i think medium term we're going to win
[1:47:08.420 --> 1:47:12.900]  because they may try to bring in an absolute authoritarianism and really try to censor and
[1:47:12.900 --> 1:47:18.980]  shut us down and at that moment the military and others are ready to stand up you know helix it's
[1:47:18.980 --> 1:47:25.700]  all kind of down to this and i think this is why i say your program your your network is so important
[1:47:25.700 --> 1:47:34.100]  we've got to have some place to gather you're right we can stop this we can stop it you know we
[1:47:34.100 --> 1:47:40.580]  can stop it because they're so afraid of us it's hey look if they didn't think we could stop it
[1:47:40.580 --> 1:47:45.860]  you know alex they wouldn't give two it's in the thing they're in huge crimes it's outrageous all
[1:47:45.860 --> 1:47:52.820]  we've got to do is expose it expose it engage the enemy and alex that's what i promise all of you as
[1:47:52.820 --> 1:47:59.860]  long as i can and i don't know how long that is but every breath i breathe i will help get through
[1:47:59.860 --> 1:48:07.060]  this election we can win this election by using whole watchers that know what they're looking for
[1:48:07.060 --> 1:48:13.300]  and in the right place all right let me stop here right there we can go and put pressure on absolutely
[1:48:13.300 --> 1:48:17.620]  larry we're out of time we're working with roger stone on that he's on tomorrow we're working with
[1:48:17.620 --> 1:48:22.100]  others on it we're going to war game with dr pacenic again coming up for 30 minutes of the
[1:48:22.100 --> 1:48:25.620]  next hour and then i'm going to cover other news after he leaves us but you're absolutely right
[1:48:25.620 --> 1:48:31.540]  history's happening thank you so much for your time and your energy and again the good news is here
[1:48:32.980 --> 1:48:38.900]  i got contacted by a lot of different police over the weekend some of them senior and they said
[1:48:38.900 --> 1:48:45.460]  you know alex is one thing to read it at info wars or breitbart but we actually now have the justice
[1:48:45.460 --> 1:48:51.140]  department and the un actually came in last week and told us they're taking control and get ready
[1:48:51.140 --> 1:48:57.300]  for a big emergency and the police are all standing there actually hearing get ready for the un
[1:48:57.300 --> 1:49:05.620]  get ready for political correctness get ready show the attempted coup physically is what's
[1:49:05.620 --> 1:49:09.860]  going to bring them down they've had their soft coup as you said but i'm telling you i don't i'd
[1:49:09.860 --> 1:49:15.300]  really the reason they're scared is they know larry that the police and military are finally
[1:49:15.300 --> 1:49:20.180]  really waking up not that they're perfect but they really get wow foreign globalists scum
[1:49:20.180 --> 1:49:23.860]  are going to overthrow the whole country and gut it and they understand it's going to destroy
[1:49:23.860 --> 1:49:28.260]  prosperity even people that aren't perfect don't want to destroy prosperity and have a creepy
[1:49:28.260 --> 1:49:32.820]  feeling right now and the and the attitude is they're ready to stand up a what do you think of
[1:49:32.820 --> 1:49:38.180]  that and be in one minute how will the globalists strike back against something like that well
[1:49:38.180 --> 1:49:45.220]  number one i believe in it a hundred percent the police have had enough and they've counted on the
[1:49:45.220 --> 1:49:51.060]  police just laying down and walking away from their jobs guess what that's not happening alex the
[1:49:51.060 --> 1:49:58.980]  police are not just having blue flu and walking away the police are standing up and i'm telling you
[1:49:58.980 --> 1:50:06.340]  the globalists are in trouble now then i get a minute but alex if we will unify if we will stand
[1:50:06.340 --> 1:50:10.420]  together and i'm not talking about one of these things we're just standing around singing come by
[1:50:10.420 --> 1:50:15.780]  yeah no there's no don't comply with the globalist expose them at every front spread the word go out
[1:50:15.780 --> 1:50:20.100]  and pull watch be look it only takes one or two of us to get into one of their buses when they're
[1:50:20.100 --> 1:50:24.660]  when they're fake voting and that's why they're scared they know we're aware of them now we're
[1:50:24.660 --> 1:50:29.620]  watching them and they're going to try to steal it and they look scared because they know everybody's
[1:50:29.620 --> 1:50:33.860]  watching that's why trump told the police you get out there and you watch what they're doing

[1:54:18.420 --> 1:54:26.580]  from deep in the heart of occupied texas now known as femo region six yes decades ago when i
[1:54:26.580 --> 1:54:32.660]  talked about that people rolled their eyes even conservatives and patriots but now folks realize
[1:54:32.660 --> 1:54:39.460]  that we were losing because the enemy was so over the top so extreme that no one wanted to say what
[1:54:39.460 --> 1:54:51.220]  was actually happening because it sounded crazy total normalcy bias stock home syndrome we must
[1:54:51.220 --> 1:54:56.180]  break through it we must admit what's happening i have stacks of articles here about censorship
[1:54:56.180 --> 1:55:01.220]  internet takeovers obama saying you know we've got to control the internet really chilling
[1:55:01.220 --> 1:55:08.580]  things are happening because the russians the russians that's right the russians are taking over
[1:55:08.580 --> 1:55:12.500]  oh my gosh if trump wins the russians did it they're actually saying that
[1:55:15.060 --> 1:55:20.740]  from others those things election fraud oh we just discovered it the russians oh oh don't worry ga
[1:55:20.740 --> 1:55:29.780]  johnson will save us but i've got two different clips msnbc cuts live coverage as hillary has
[1:55:29.780 --> 1:55:33.300]  one of the worst coving fits ever now you were able to see because we have the internet
[1:55:33.300 --> 1:55:42.420]  and then separately who saw the anointment incredible tv high ratings the black preachers
[1:55:42.420 --> 1:55:50.820]  coming over and putting the blessing on donald trump and then the clear rapport and and love
[1:55:50.820 --> 1:55:56.740]  going on don't like it so here i'm not we're supposed to cut the feed get out of here even
[1:55:56.740 --> 1:56:00.660]  though they have a paid subscription service that's supposed to cover the whole deal we could go
[1:56:00.660 --> 1:56:04.180]  subscribe to thompson roiders i just don't ever work with the globalist and maybe we should
[1:56:04.740 --> 1:56:09.540]  and right side news that's where they get their feed you hear them saying cut it cut it cut it
[1:56:09.540 --> 1:56:16.100]  don't people see the preachers liking trump we've got those clips let's play the msnbc clip first
[1:56:16.100 --> 1:56:27.140]  here it is everybody except him and when he says i alone can fix it that clearly demonstrates he
[1:56:27.140 --> 1:56:34.980]  doesn't understand how america works how we got great and why we are great today and what we need
[1:56:34.980 --> 1:56:42.900]  to do together to face the future because our campaign we've been listening to hillary clinton
[1:56:42.900 --> 1:56:48.260]  speaking in cleveland ohio that is tim kane right behind over her right shoulder uh speaking about
[1:56:48.260 --> 1:56:52.980]  the type of campaign she wants to run and the optimism she has and also if you've been watching
[1:56:52.980 --> 1:56:57.860]  for a while she had quite a coughing fit at the very beginning of the address she'd even joked at
[1:56:57.860 --> 1:57:02.660]  one point uh it's part of her allergy to donald trump and she got through that joining me now
[1:57:02.660 --> 1:57:07.220]  to discuss ego volsky from the center for american progress action fund and lorenz jones a conservative
[1:57:07.220 --> 1:57:11.540]  radio host oh she got through it but she did she started coughing right after it she showed a little
[1:57:11.540 --> 1:57:15.380]  piece show she got through it she's tough now let's go to the other feed being cut this is a
[1:57:15.380 --> 1:57:19.300]  hundred percent clear they're saying cut the feed cut the feed you have to listen carefully you can
[1:57:19.300 --> 1:57:24.580]  hear him arguing saying hey i'd rather take a cut and pay and not cut the feed you know we're supposed
[1:57:24.580 --> 1:57:33.140]  to cover this let's go to the feed i when the woman who had the issue of blood said that i can only
[1:57:33.140 --> 1:57:40.420]  touch to him of jesus god and i would make it home nothing else could help her but the power of god

[1:58:41.220 --> 1:58:44.980]  feed but you can hear him talking there then they cut the feed when ordered did you do not show

[1:59:53.380 --> 2:00:15.380]  jones show
[2:00:23.700 --> 2:00:35.380]  all right so i was getting into this article that we posted in the video
[2:00:37.460 --> 2:00:44.180]  over the holiday of donald trump in detroit michigan speaking at a black church
[2:00:45.860 --> 2:00:49.780]  and when they got to the part of the anointing and the preacher up there talking with trump
[2:00:49.780 --> 2:00:54.740]  thompson reuters that runs video feeds all over the world that subscribers pay for
[2:00:56.020 --> 2:01:02.260]  just says cutting or if you're wearing a trump shirt when you're on tv they blur that out
[2:01:02.260 --> 2:01:08.820]  this is what they do this is part of the order that's gone out for perception management so
[2:01:08.820 --> 2:01:18.740]  let's finish that clip all right when things seem like is almost impossible you will read mark nine
[2:01:18.740 --> 2:01:39.380]  twenty three if now is the lead and there they are they cut the feed right there
[2:01:39.380 --> 2:01:47.140]  in everyone's face they cut the feed
[2:01:49.700 --> 2:01:55.860]  and they do this all the time now when trump says hillary is working with isis and helped found
[2:01:55.860 --> 2:01:59.940]  them cut when he first said that remember they cut it on a bunch of different networks then
[2:01:59.940 --> 2:02:03.540]  they couldn't hide the fact that it was said so then they tried to spend it and lie about it but
[2:02:03.540 --> 2:02:08.580]  now they've been forced to basically admit it's true this is how they deceive this is how they
[2:02:08.580 --> 2:02:16.420]  manipulate and they're doing it more and more and it's not just censoring the videos themselves
[2:02:16.420 --> 2:02:28.260]  or censoring the feeds take things like dr. drew a week or so after i mean i said five days because
[2:02:28.260 --> 2:02:33.940]  it came out that he had officially been told is losing his job five days after but he technically
[2:02:33.940 --> 2:02:37.700]  eight days later it was announced that he lost his job but why that matters i don't know i get
[2:02:37.700 --> 2:02:43.380]  into factoids it's now been reported by the new york post that indeed he was told to retract it
[2:02:44.100 --> 2:02:51.460]  and wouldn't do it so he was removed and if there was only one case of this you could say oh well
[2:02:51.460 --> 2:02:59.060]  it's not that bad but they admit under obama and under the leftist rule we have seen censorship
[2:02:59.060 --> 2:03:03.380]  of the press in this country never before seen it's unamerican it's anti-freedom and just like
[2:03:03.380 --> 2:03:08.420]  julien assange said last week in a new york times interview where's the instinct of the press for
[2:03:08.420 --> 2:03:16.740]  sole preservation why don't you stick together what is your problem this press climate is unbelievable
[2:03:17.620 --> 2:03:22.820]  this press climate is one of the most out of control dangerous
[2:03:24.820 --> 2:03:31.860]  we have ever seen in the history of this country and it is so that's why every american has to
[2:03:31.860 --> 2:03:38.100]  use their first amendment and to be as aggressive with it as you can whether it's a blog talk radio
[2:03:38.100 --> 2:03:44.260]  show or youtube channel you have or whether it's going into local radio show or an access show or
[2:03:44.260 --> 2:03:47.700]  you know maybe you're a filmmaker that normally makes films on something else make a political
[2:03:47.700 --> 2:03:53.220]  film uh your cartoonists now make it political everybody has to basically make art and make
[2:03:53.220 --> 2:03:58.020]  culture that counters the globalist so people understand we're the majority we're the common
[2:03:58.020 --> 2:04:02.180]  sense we're not part of this system they're selling and they're pushing
[2:04:05.700 --> 2:04:12.740]  and also that liberty lovers don't territorialize information we're in a war it is not about

[2:08:09.300 --> 2:08:16.100]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance you're listening to alex jones
[2:08:16.100 --> 2:08:25.940]  there is undoubtedly a move to set up a planetary government
[2:08:26.580 --> 2:08:35.700]  globalism was set up after world war two and sold to academics as a plan to use the west wealth
[2:08:35.700 --> 2:08:41.700]  to build up the third world and create a planet of peace we were told that the state department
[2:08:41.700 --> 2:08:47.140]  memorandum 7277 and the different public laws for us to disarm would be part of some new utopia
[2:08:48.420 --> 2:08:52.980]  the truth is under globalism special interests have used it to cheat and to create a crony
[2:08:52.980 --> 2:08:59.940]  capitalist system that has made the west poor and the third world even more dangerous so now
[2:08:59.940 --> 2:09:06.740]  we're told we see a system where globalism is crisis management and the controllers only want
[2:09:06.740 --> 2:09:14.820]  to make more crises because they then pose as the saviors this is 21st century warfare but once
[2:09:14.820 --> 2:09:20.980]  you're aware of this form of warfare it's not effective anymore because the people are aware
[2:09:20.980 --> 2:09:25.940]  of what's happening now we've got obama getting off in china being snubbed on the back of the plane
[2:09:25.940 --> 2:09:31.300]  chinese officials yammering and yelling this is our country our airport in their face unprecedented
[2:09:31.300 --> 2:09:36.020]  you've got hillary having giant coughing fits then in her press conference having coughing fits
[2:09:36.020 --> 2:09:40.900]  then saying it's a conspiracy theory having to stop because of coughing fits is that congestive
[2:09:40.900 --> 2:09:45.460]  heart failure i mean what on earth is going on here uh dr drew it's now been confirmed was
[2:09:45.460 --> 2:09:51.300]  threatened uh and basically told her a track but he wouldn't you have russia and saudi arabia
[2:09:52.340 --> 2:09:58.900]  coming out saying that they're going to start freezing oil production that's made oil prices
[2:09:58.900 --> 2:10:03.380]  go back up what does all this mean i don't normally have dr pachinicon maybe once a month
[2:10:03.380 --> 2:10:09.780]  really smart guy but things are so hot and heavy i had him on uh last week so i thought we had him
[2:10:09.780 --> 2:10:15.060]  pop back in because we ran out of time to talk about de-evolution now people think of that as
[2:10:15.060 --> 2:10:18.820]  like going back to horse and buggies you know it means taking the power back from the central
[2:10:18.820 --> 2:10:24.020]  government back to locales back to the people we've seen this with brexit we see this with the
[2:10:24.020 --> 2:10:30.900]  situation with the catalonians there in spain we see this all over the world for these artificial
[2:10:30.900 --> 2:10:37.380]  structures that were set up by colonialism are falling apart but here it means washington and
[2:10:37.380 --> 2:10:43.780]  other areas run by socials falling apart people running to areas uh that the global stone control
[2:10:43.780 --> 2:10:49.540]  and prosperity then taking place the problem is then like locust unconsciously the parasites and
[2:10:49.540 --> 2:10:55.060]  their controllers moved to the next area where we fled to so i wanted to speak to this but since
[2:10:55.060 --> 2:11:00.180]  he was on with us last week so much has already come out so much has happened with more leaks
[2:11:00.180 --> 2:11:06.500]  more information hillary being fallen around by ambulances hillary uh being being photographed
[2:11:06.500 --> 2:11:11.620]  coming out of black SUVs with the whole back lowers down with a wheelchair i mean clearly
[2:11:11.620 --> 2:11:17.060]  she's degenerating fast where she can't even give a speech once a week uh we're gonna talk about all
[2:11:17.060 --> 2:11:24.100]  this and more the attempt to hand the internet over to this multinational consortium big things
[2:11:24.100 --> 2:11:32.340]  are afoot big agreements are afoot major shifts are happening um the good news is and i'm not again
[2:11:32.340 --> 2:11:37.300]  lionizing them but people are always saying well where's the military where are the police and all
[2:11:37.300 --> 2:11:41.380]  this well when you have open corruption hillary and the emails and all the rest of it nobody gets
[2:11:41.380 --> 2:11:46.580]  in trouble it sends a message and you have george soros trying to start the disabilization campaign
[2:11:46.580 --> 2:11:51.300]  against local governments to then bring the un in and now they're announcing the justice department
[2:11:51.300 --> 2:11:57.300]  to run the elections this is really waking people up and you see the symbol of the rotting facade of
[2:11:57.300 --> 2:12:03.220]  the establishment of these multinational interests that are taking control of our country the arrogance
[2:12:03.220 --> 2:12:09.940]  to have hillary foisted this corpse shoved in front of us i think as i've said many times this
[2:12:09.940 --> 2:12:17.380]  month is emblematic of a of a so-called elite that is out of touch to the point of chinese officials
[2:12:17.380 --> 2:12:23.780]  arrogantly screaming you're nothing this is our country our airport i mean this is this is disintegration
[2:12:23.780 --> 2:12:31.780]  obama four to five months a year on vacation refusing to go to louisiana uh just the total
[2:12:31.780 --> 2:12:38.260]  disconnect is this the marianne twanette moment is the power structure crashing and burning
[2:12:38.260 --> 2:12:45.460]  and where do we go at the end of this dr pacinic alex it's always a pleasure but i think the key word
[2:12:45.460 --> 2:12:51.780]  that you use was marianne twanette and let me give you in the audience a very clear idea of what we're
[2:12:51.780 --> 2:12:59.300]  talking about in a liberal newspaper the new york times which often criticizes us but sometimes
[2:12:59.300 --> 2:13:07.860]  offers very interesting information they wrote about the fact that she is making over 156 thousand
[2:13:07.860 --> 2:13:17.140]  dollars per hour let me repeat it again 156 thousand dollars per hour for the rich and the very rich
[2:13:17.140 --> 2:13:24.020]  and the very famous she's sequestered away in martha's venues in the hamptons and beaverley hills
[2:13:24.020 --> 2:13:30.020]  will not talk to anybody and make sure that if you take a picture with her and you're a child
[2:13:30.020 --> 2:13:35.380]  that costs two thousand if you bring your family along with you and you want a group picture with
[2:13:35.380 --> 2:13:43.540]  hillar that's 10 000 but literally she makes 156 000 per hour taking pictures with her not doing
[2:13:43.540 --> 2:13:50.580]  anything not creating anything not implementing a program or even being able to articulate a policy
[2:13:50.580 --> 2:13:57.860]  so what we have here is literally the beginning of the end of the marianne twanette school of
[2:13:57.860 --> 2:14:04.900]  government she is finished she understands that and in fact has a woman who intercedes for her by
[2:14:04.900 --> 2:14:11.700]  the name and it's the most ludicrous thing i've ever seen but it's but it's it's epitomizes the
[2:14:11.700 --> 2:14:19.140]  then the absurdity of how hillary is so alien from us the lady who intervenes on behalf of
[2:14:19.140 --> 2:14:27.620]  hillary clinton is lady lin forster the Rothschild a friend who makes sure that nobody asks hillary
[2:14:27.620 --> 2:14:33.540]  any hard questions does not get in the confrontation and makes sure that everybody pays a hundred
[2:14:33.540 --> 2:14:41.780]  thousand dollars per couple at a lamb dinner in a moth's vineyard uh state now lady lin forster the
[2:14:41.780 --> 2:14:52.500]  Rothschild in essence is a woman who was born in bergen new jersey it has no uh no credentials
[2:14:52.500 --> 2:14:58.260]  whatsoever she's a wannabe she's married to a Rothschild she's not even yeah she's not even a
[2:14:58.260 --> 2:15:04.500]  Rothschild but the Rothschilds aren't even Rothschild so the point of fact is what alex is saying is
[2:15:04.500 --> 2:15:11.540]  the system is breaking down because a Rothschild is totally irrelevant to this country a Rothschild
[2:15:11.540 --> 2:15:17.780]  was nothing more than a family of shilox who loaned out money in the 14th century in frankfurt
[2:15:17.780 --> 2:15:24.820]  germany and became some nobility they didn't create anything they didn't invest or invite create
[2:15:24.820 --> 2:15:31.940]  any new medicines or any great works of art so what you have here is the ultimate corruption
[2:15:31.940 --> 2:15:38.980]  of the elite including the sources including the banjo these including the hollywood elite
[2:15:38.980 --> 2:15:45.780]  and what's happening is even the liberal people like the new york times has to show you that the
[2:15:45.780 --> 2:15:51.940]  contrast between what the people are talking about the hillary clinton's and all the liberals
[2:15:51.940 --> 2:15:58.260]  and how they live wearing ten thousand dollar outfits and receiving a hundred and fifty six
[2:15:58.260 --> 2:16:05.380]  thousand per hour is so out of control that the devolution of power is coming imminently
[2:16:05.380 --> 2:16:12.020]  i said the secret service can't stop it the fbi can't stop it well what they do is reinforce a
[2:16:12.020 --> 2:16:19.300]  marianne tornado louis 16th and the venera and on top of that one of the things that came in alex
[2:16:19.300 --> 2:16:24.900]  and what we were talking about that when hillary gets in if she gets in because she's always so
[2:16:24.900 --> 2:16:30.900]  incapacitated physically and mentally dr drew agreed with that and many other interners agree
[2:16:30.900 --> 2:16:38.260]  with that we have mr tim kane now i purposely left out one element of tim kane when i said that he
[2:16:38.260 --> 2:16:46.180]  was in fact a cia jesuit operative with negroponte the new york times came back on an article didn't
[2:16:46.180 --> 2:16:53.540]  address me but it was addressed to me and alex saying he was not a cia operative which was absurd
[2:16:53.540 --> 2:16:59.060]  but instead they explained how he was part of liberation theology now to show you that's good
[2:16:59.060 --> 2:17:06.660]  words report foundation well it's even worse than that the liberation theology and they didn't realize
[2:17:06.660 --> 2:17:15.700]  that neither did tim kane it's about communism it's about the jesuits who practice equal subsidies for
[2:17:15.700 --> 2:17:23.380]  all the peasants and everyone else were considered anti-american pro-communist pro-socialist and in
[2:17:23.380 --> 2:17:33.620]  fact pope frances who had had two of his jesuits killed four nuns assassinated supported this gentleman
[2:17:33.620 --> 2:17:40.500]  tim kane so what we have is not only the church falling apart the Rothschild falling apart the
[2:17:40.500 --> 2:17:46.340]  hillary clinton's falling apart the entire establishment the secret service not really able
[2:17:46.340 --> 2:17:54.340]  to do what they're supposed to the fbi totally emasculated and we had therefore the devolution
[2:17:54.340 --> 2:17:58.020]  of power and you have hillary have you seen the photos of the press when she did this one press
[2:17:58.020 --> 2:18:03.940]  conference that wasn't a press conference the first in over 170 days with about a dozen women and two
[2:18:03.940 --> 2:18:11.060]  men looking at her like she is jesus coming down from heaven at mount olives i mean when you look
[2:18:11.060 --> 2:18:17.620]  at the way and the videos of how they've fallen after her it is such a sick joke i mean what is
[2:18:17.620 --> 2:18:23.860]  going on here well what's going on is the fact you know alex we've seen this before with the
[2:18:23.860 --> 2:18:29.700]  bush administration and bill clinton and the obama administration what happens is the minute they
[2:18:29.700 --> 2:18:36.260]  became president they immediately isolate themselves off and i've got to go back again to the secret
[2:18:36.260 --> 2:18:43.540]  service the secret service has not served america they have served a president of the united states
[2:18:43.540 --> 2:18:51.540]  and creates by their definition of their jobs this isolated notion of a precious individual
[2:18:51.540 --> 2:18:57.780]  who can't be assassinated now i'm not advocating assassination i'm just simply stating the fact
[2:18:57.780 --> 2:19:02.980]  that no person no i get it i mean they're totally like like chinese princesses with their feet bound
[2:19:02.980 --> 2:19:09.140]  in a you know ivory tower in lawland disconnected at the same time that they're working on our dollar
[2:19:09.140 --> 2:19:13.300]  it's our tax dollars that pay so they're not servants they become emperors so let me ask you
[2:19:13.300 --> 2:19:22.180]  this question yes looking at this how far can it go because my historical gut just and by that i mean
[2:19:22.180 --> 2:19:27.380]  my gut my common sense but also history shows when you get a type of rotten elite like this
[2:19:27.380 --> 2:19:31.620]  they're delusional uh other countries that are corrupt and out of control and have their own
[2:19:31.620 --> 2:19:37.380]  problems still wouldn't put up with stuff like this there's an incredible disdain uh disrespect and
[2:19:37.380 --> 2:19:44.740]  then we look at how other countries are treating not so much our military our people but treating
[2:19:44.740 --> 2:19:50.180]  obama making him get off the back of the plane getting in their face this yesterday uh not
[2:19:50.180 --> 2:19:54.740]  having a red carpet what does that signify by the chinese well it's a little bit worse than that my
[2:19:54.740 --> 2:20:02.580]  friend if if anybody recalls the president of the philippine toward that date just called obama the
[2:20:02.580 --> 2:20:08.900]  son of a whore he said he said his mother is a whore which is actually true well irrespective
[2:20:08.900 --> 2:20:12.900]  of the religion shows how informed he is his mother was in pornography with the communist
[2:20:12.900 --> 2:20:18.900]  publisher i mean it's amazing but go ahead no no but what the point is i could not imagine
[2:20:18.900 --> 2:20:25.700]  that that president the president of philippines would ever mention that or say anything to putin
[2:20:26.340 --> 2:20:33.620]  to president of china so what has happened is we've created this isolated weak individual
[2:20:33.620 --> 2:20:40.260]  which will continue with hillary who cannot stand up for anything cannot assert the position of
[2:20:40.260 --> 2:20:45.780]  america and really does not represent the united states i agree let's go back to i mean philippine
[2:20:45.780 --> 2:20:49.540]  is a big ally of the u.s they know that china is being allowed to walk around in there our
[2:20:49.540 --> 2:20:54.980]  military doesn't like it i mean why would he make that provocation because he doesn't give a damn
[2:20:54.980 --> 2:21:00.260]  about uh obama but there's a some more serious problem and i'll tell you what it is when i was
[2:21:00.260 --> 2:21:05.700]  deputy assistant secretary of east asia under the baker administration i had to deal with the
[2:21:05.700 --> 2:21:12.180]  philippines and i noticed that when i came in to their prime minister in their offices they would
[2:21:12.180 --> 2:21:19.940]  sit there it's in a very arrogant way and kind of treat me in a very patronizing way although i was
[2:21:19.940 --> 2:21:25.940]  technically over their country and but what i knew and they did not know is that i had their visa
[2:21:25.940 --> 2:21:31.460]  applications because every one of the leaders of the philippines including marco sequino
[2:21:31.460 --> 2:21:38.500]  had american citizenship or american visas so when this individual started to shoot his mouth off
[2:21:38.500 --> 2:21:43.780]  about our presence in the philippine i cut him off immediately and i said you know what
[2:21:43.780 --> 2:21:49.940]  your visa's up and i will explain something to you very quickly you keep you shut your mouth
[2:21:49.940 --> 2:21:53.860]  you say what we're going to tell you you're going to nod your head when i tell you what we're going
[2:21:53.860 --> 2:21:58.740]  to do we will give you a half a billion dollars that was my instructions and we're leaving your
[2:21:58.740 --> 2:22:04.260]  base in the subic bay and we're going to singapore do you understand that and if you don't i'm going
[2:22:04.260 --> 2:22:11.460]  to withdraw your visa that was it and handling him that way he shut his mouth he kept quiet
[2:22:11.460 --> 2:22:17.540]  sure so it's just classic male bravada and trump uh understands that you look at somebody like obama
[2:22:17.540 --> 2:22:23.540]  who bows and kisses everybody's ass doesn't he get that's the exact wrong message no because
[2:22:23.540 --> 2:22:28.980]  once again alex one of the things we haven't talked about is when you're a weak individual what do
[2:22:28.980 --> 2:22:35.140]  you pick as your coterie of advisers there's all sick offense hillary has one of the worst
[2:22:35.780 --> 2:22:42.740]  group of advisers i've ever seen their continuity of the sandy burgers the susan rices they come out
[2:22:42.740 --> 2:22:48.180]  of think tanks they're totally inept in what they do the little office weasels that just sit around
[2:22:48.180 --> 2:22:51.780]  and a speech writer so they just sit around all day at lunch telling each other how smart they are
[2:22:52.420 --> 2:22:57.860]  well it's not only that it's a problem for us because we have to be able the american public
[2:22:57.860 --> 2:23:03.140]  has to be able to vet out all of these people including for trump i have to tell you exactly
[2:23:03.140 --> 2:23:09.620]  what i said last time about manifold christie has to leave the trump campaign i've said no you said
[2:23:09.620 --> 2:23:13.860]  months before manaford's the problem is going to be russian you were right now you're saying
[2:23:13.860 --> 2:23:17.380]  get rid of chris christie i'm going to be a rocket scientist to know that i mean chris christie
[2:23:17.380 --> 2:23:23.860]  obviously is going to deal 360 he's going to he's going to work with i mean you're literally infiltrating
[2:23:23.860 --> 2:23:28.900]  yourself bringing that giant chipmunk into your operation what i'm saying also is that i'm warning
[2:23:28.900 --> 2:23:35.860]  the trump in the in the hillary campaign on your show that they should not be getting advice from
[2:23:35.860 --> 2:23:41.860]  neocons like steve hadley and zalmi hallazad because the people on this show and the millions of
[2:23:41.860 --> 2:23:47.620]  americans who fought against the bush and clinton administration are watching against seeing steve
[2:23:47.620 --> 2:23:55.220]  hadley woeful with zalmi hall all the neocons who created 911 and created the war in iraq being
[2:23:55.220 --> 2:24:01.460]  questioned and being offered positions in the uh government if that occurs i will say it
[2:24:01.460 --> 2:24:07.940]  categorically the secret service the fbi and many other institutions will have very serious
[2:24:07.940 --> 2:24:16.260]  problems very serious problems if the bush people come back in any shape or form either under hillary
[2:24:16.260 --> 2:24:20.980]  or on the chart so under the soft coup being orchestrated by patriots in the country just
[2:24:20.980 --> 2:24:25.380]  their information war the bush and the clintons are out we're going to have fair policies for the
[2:24:25.380 --> 2:24:31.140]  us we're not breaking the united states for globalism there's some sacrificial lamb to impress the
[2:24:31.140 --> 2:24:36.980]  chinese or anybody else so let's talk about how we make sure that happens well one of the ways
[2:24:36.980 --> 2:24:42.260]  it happens is we at the local level for example in florida we support a man called tedio ho event
[2:24:42.260 --> 2:24:47.460]  naryon came out of the what's called the tea party here but it's not this is a microcosm example
[2:24:47.460 --> 2:24:54.020]  explain how we accelerate the the the patriot liberty takeover of the states the way we do that
[2:24:54.020 --> 2:25:01.140]  is to make sure we we pinpoint our local candidates who support one our national security at the
[2:25:01.140 --> 2:25:06.260]  national level and at the local level secondly we want to make sure that these individuals are not
[2:25:06.260 --> 2:25:12.020]  beholden to big business in any way thirdly we want to make sure that they have values that
[2:25:12.020 --> 2:25:19.220]  are consistent with this country is a judaeo christian entity and fourthly and fifthly they're
[2:25:19.220 --> 2:25:24.820]  people who will respond to you when you write to them or tweet to them i give you an example of ted
[2:25:24.820 --> 2:25:31.220]  yoho who's a vet local vet naryon decided to run for congress had never been in politics came and
[2:25:31.220 --> 2:25:37.540]  met with us a whole group of liberals uh right and you're saying so you can organize them you can
[2:25:37.540 --> 2:25:43.300]  inform them and you can use them to organize even more by getting involved in promising campaigns
[2:25:43.300 --> 2:25:48.420]  twitter at steve pacenic dot com we should point out that dr pacenic is working around the clock
[2:25:48.420 --> 2:25:52.660]  trying to save this country if you are running for local office and and and you're on the tea party
[2:25:52.660 --> 2:25:57.220]  patriot uh you know system trying to restore the republic and make this country free again and great
[2:25:57.220 --> 2:26:02.340]  again dr pacenic is just now launching this even though he's retired because this is the final big
[2:26:02.340 --> 2:26:08.340]  battle for the republic folks and you can find him at twitter at steve pacenic dot com or twitter
[2:26:08.340 --> 2:26:14.580]  at steve pacenic or steve pacenic dot com go ahead thank you out please continue talking
[2:26:14.580 --> 2:26:19.620]  about what devolution is because you predicted here like five years ago it's happening well it's
[2:26:19.620 --> 2:26:27.380]  happening very quickly because our tax dollars can no longer afford the the the price of obama going
[2:26:27.380 --> 2:26:33.460]  from the golf courses of martha's vineyard and right into china where he really doesn't need to go
[2:26:33.460 --> 2:26:40.020]  to an asian meeting i've been in asian meeting their waste of time and it cost us 186 thousand
[2:26:40.020 --> 2:26:45.460]  dollars per hour for one of his planes and you've doubled that because he's got two to three planes
[2:26:45.460 --> 2:26:52.420]  going number two you get involved at the state and local levels and commissioners i mean literally
[2:26:52.420 --> 2:26:58.260]  and you go for the candidate if the candidate doesn't have a party or it's a libertarian party
[2:26:58.260 --> 2:27:03.300]  even a democratic party you make sure that candidate responds to you and you work for that
[2:27:03.300 --> 2:27:09.620]  candidate at the local level and organize your friends and neighbors to make sure that we have
[2:27:09.620 --> 2:27:14.900]  people who can respond you know you just don't vote you infiltrate the political process correct
[2:27:14.900 --> 2:27:19.940]  this is a whole new revolution alex and you're absolutely right you've articulated in a way
[2:27:19.940 --> 2:27:25.380]  we've never had it before because of twitter because of the internet we're able to now
[2:27:25.380 --> 2:27:31.940]  sustain a dialogue with our local representatives back them up work with them for free if it's
[2:27:31.940 --> 2:27:38.020]  voluntary if you have a few dollars you give it to them the national level now is not as relevant
[2:27:38.020 --> 2:27:43.540]  and the reason for that is that we're devolving power to the state level the governor's becoming
[2:27:43.540 --> 2:27:49.380]  more powerful the county commissioners becoming even more powerful your judges your tax collectors
[2:27:49.380 --> 2:27:52.980]  because they're learning the feds don't have any power because they're not even federal anymore
[2:27:52.980 --> 2:27:58.580]  they're globalist and so just start disregarding if we all start not not responding it'll be a
[2:27:59.140 --> 2:28:04.900]  it'll be a bloodless revolution game over you got it alex just hit it on the head what relevance
[2:28:04.900 --> 2:28:11.460]  is the fbi really have to the local community none zippo zero they can't even indict someone
[2:28:11.460 --> 2:28:18.340]  on the federal level other than somebody on pornography not on drugs nothing on the secret
[2:28:18.340 --> 2:28:23.860]  service nothing department of justice nothing department of education in other words we just
[2:28:23.860 --> 2:28:31.300]  ignore them whether it's financially with the irs and we start playing uh and lower our tax bases
[2:28:31.300 --> 2:28:35.460]  with them and and dedicate yourself to that because they need our money we'll talk more
[2:28:35.460 --> 2:28:38.500]  about that but let me throw this thing before we go to break and come back into one more segment
[2:28:38.500 --> 2:28:42.020]  what about the fact that i've talked to the average fbi agent they're just dealing with bank
[2:28:42.020 --> 2:28:45.220]  robberies and kidnappings and are good people and more awake the general public when we say
[2:28:45.220 --> 2:28:48.980]  these agencies are bad though the individual men and women on average i wouldn't say are they've
[2:28:48.980 --> 2:28:54.260]  got bad leaders and bad management what do we what happens to them i mean i what are they
[2:28:54.260 --> 2:28:58.580]  supposed to tell you what happens one of the i think you hit on something that's very important
[2:28:58.580 --> 2:29:04.100]  where when nine eleven occurred a couple of the cia operatives and others came up to me to literally
[2:29:04.100 --> 2:29:10.340]  apologize and excuse themselves and the one question i had is was your pension that important
[2:29:10.340 --> 2:29:16.100]  that you could allow people to be killed and american people to be killed and and they looked
[2:29:16.100 --> 2:29:21.300]  at me with shame and the problem is alex and this is what we have to reconstitute the federal
[2:29:21.300 --> 2:29:26.740]  government no more pensions for 20 years no one neither the military let's talk about that we talked
[2:29:26.740 --> 2:29:30.660]  about that friday but but i mean here's my deal not again i'm not lying i was the fbi i've been a
[2:29:30.660 --> 2:29:34.740]  big critic it was the fbi that mainly exposed on eleven actually wouldn't happen you know they were
[2:29:34.740 --> 2:29:38.740]  the ones that really a lot of them were involved well no i know they were but i'm talking about
[2:29:38.740 --> 2:29:42.420]  also people's time at the flight schools and stuff well i know you were there day one exposing it
[2:29:42.420 --> 2:29:46.260]  you were with uh other groups but we're gonna talk about that when we come back with dr steve
[2:29:46.260 --> 2:29:51.700]  pachennick this is important information we're on the march the empires on the will they run a false
[2:29:51.700 --> 2:30:01.140]  flag on alex jones and the gcn radio network that question joe biggs here with info wars.com
[2:30:01.140 --> 2:30:05.940]  does hillary clinton have parkinson's disease we can all see that she has some very serious health
[2:30:05.940 --> 2:30:10.500]  problems article up by michael snider it has been my contention for a long time that hillary
[2:30:10.500 --> 2:30:15.380]  clinton would do or say just about anything in order to become the first woman president but
[2:30:15.380 --> 2:30:19.460]  what she actually lied to the american people about her health in order to reach that historic
[2:30:19.460 --> 2:30:24.900]  achievement in recent days a clinton campaign has assured us over and over again about how
[2:30:24.900 --> 2:30:30.260]  healthy hillary is and she even opened up a jar of pickles for jimmy kimmel in order to prove how
[2:30:30.260 --> 2:30:35.300]  vigorous she is at her age but we can all see that she has some very serious health problems on labor
[2:30:35.300 --> 2:30:39.860]  day clinton had another one of her epic coughing fits and this time it happened during election
[2:30:39.860 --> 2:30:44.820]  rally in cleveland that was being broadcast nationwide she attempted to laugh it off by
[2:30:44.820 --> 2:30:49.380]  making jokes such as every time i think about trump i get allergic guess what you're sick we're all

[2:33:39.220 --> 2:33:46.820]  about trump being like reagan her last column she'd written the day she died and we're going to air
[2:33:46.820 --> 2:33:52.580]  this week to interview we did with her about a month ago dead crews and folks tried to take over
[2:33:52.580 --> 2:33:59.300]  her operation but with his with her daughter but she handed it over to her son uh twitter users

[2:34:04.900 --> 2:34:10.420]  article was trump in mexico recalls reagan in geneva and just how it was real
[2:34:12.580 --> 2:34:19.620]  political detain and bringing people together and a win-win around nationalism not globalism
[2:34:19.620 --> 2:34:25.060]  i want to talk to dr pacinic about the failure of globalism what was designed to fail they
[2:34:25.060 --> 2:34:28.900]  promise all this kumbaya that'd be great but that's not what it was they use it to cheat people
[2:34:29.780 --> 2:34:34.980]  they use it to position themselves and they have no sense because if you screw everyone over then
[2:34:34.980 --> 2:34:40.180]  there's not a nice place to even be rich you know then you're ruling things from some third world
[2:34:40.180 --> 2:34:46.180]  hell you've got a castle on the hill but that shows you different mindsets of these control freaks those
[2:34:46.180 --> 2:34:52.260]  of which would dominate and control us versus those of which wish to live in freedom before i
[2:34:52.260 --> 2:34:56.340]  go any further uh we fund our operations self funding a lot of the media is going to this model
[2:34:56.340 --> 2:35:01.300]  now uh we've done it because we can get the sponsors to fund the operation but it takes
[2:35:01.300 --> 2:35:06.100]  too much time and too much energy that we could be focusing on information war and instead we can
[2:35:06.100 --> 2:35:10.900]  simply go out and get great products that we use that we like try to have the lowest prices out
[2:35:10.900 --> 2:35:15.140]  there a lot of times we do always competitive and then let folks know that it's a win-win you buy
[2:35:15.140 --> 2:35:18.340]  these products you need that are high quality that funds our operation we have the widest

[2:36:20.180 --> 2:36:27.060]  for a limited time at infowarstore.com and just that meme alone is one of the top searched items
[2:36:27.060 --> 2:36:33.460]  on the internet we look at hillary and the photos of her wheelchair truck that she gets out of i mean
[2:36:33.460 --> 2:36:38.740]  this is all coming out we just point out what people should look for then the independent press
[2:36:38.740 --> 2:36:43.860]  goes out and does it and then the globalists are in deep trouble so i want to move quick on the
[2:36:43.860 --> 2:36:49.060]  10 minutes we have left with dr steve pacenic twitter at steve pacenic or you just go to
[2:36:49.060 --> 2:36:54.420]  steve pacenic.com find his books and more doc asked me just to overall give us some quick answers
[2:36:54.420 --> 2:36:59.460]  on some subjects here i know you have a lot of sources i don't know if you have talked to them
[2:36:59.460 --> 2:37:04.660]  on this subject or is it just your own research when you were on with this i don't know three
[2:37:04.660 --> 2:37:08.740]  four weeks ago and you said she needs to have an independent group of medical examiners neurologists
[2:37:08.740 --> 2:37:13.780]  look at her that word for word has been said by obama's former doctor last week it's been said by
[2:37:13.780 --> 2:37:20.580]  dr drew two weeks ago and he was fired less than a week later it's been said by now scores of doctors
[2:37:20.580 --> 2:37:25.940]  are coming out after they fired dr drew and saying look this is dangerous we should be allowed to go
[2:37:25.940 --> 2:37:32.340]  on the radio and say that you know armor thyroid and cumydin and rat poison don't mix well who the
[2:37:32.340 --> 2:37:36.820]  hell are her doctors the same thing you said weeks before so i think bigger than hillary's illness
[2:37:36.820 --> 2:37:42.340]  is this attack on the freedom of the press the attack on the free speech of medical professionals
[2:37:42.820 --> 2:37:50.420]  and the fact that mainstream media would so gleefully go along with this oppression really
[2:37:50.420 --> 2:37:55.300]  concerns me i mean yes there's an awakening yes globalism's in trouble but just like julie and
[2:37:55.300 --> 2:38:02.900]  assange wiki leaks said last week that the media climate of of hopping up and down with glee when
[2:38:02.900 --> 2:38:09.380]  the press is censored or medical professionals are censored uh really should concern everyone
[2:38:09.380 --> 2:38:15.620]  about where this country's going i think you're absolutely right alex one of the things why you
[2:38:15.620 --> 2:38:21.140]  one of the things why you and again i know you don't like my praising what we're doing and what
[2:38:21.140 --> 2:38:26.900]  you're doing is one of the things that happen and you have to remember not only are they attacking
[2:38:26.900 --> 2:38:32.740]  you but when she says alex jones has this conspiracy theory that i'm dying she's clearly
[2:38:32.740 --> 2:38:38.420]  attacking me and others no exactly no she says alex jones they mean they mean the pantheon of
[2:38:38.420 --> 2:38:44.740]  guests well what they mean is a pantheon but in in particular they were hitting something i said
[2:38:44.740 --> 2:38:52.420]  because it's very hard for someone like myself forget who i am steve pacenek is but when you're
[2:38:52.420 --> 2:38:58.820]  a board examiner board certified psychiatrist haven't bought you are medical doctor from
[2:38:58.820 --> 2:39:07.460]  cornell harvard and mit it is very hard for the new york times and cnn to come and attack you
[2:39:08.100 --> 2:39:12.180]  and in fact that's why no one attacked you they've been attacking us for this story every other
[2:39:12.180 --> 2:39:16.500]  day they've attacked you but here's the thing they wouldn't attack you and that that was key
[2:39:16.500 --> 2:39:22.260]  because it was powerful well that's exactly it but what's happening alex is that we're working
[2:39:22.260 --> 2:39:30.420]  so well together that in effect i expected that jeff zooker the head of cnn not a very bright guy
[2:39:31.060 --> 2:39:37.300]  not a smart guy a guy who's just interested in money and i expected him to shut down dr
[2:39:37.300 --> 2:39:44.660]  drew who's a board certified internist and he did it so what we're really watching alex and this is
[2:39:44.660 --> 2:39:51.380]  happening across the board is we're seeing the rise of fascism of the left and that's what you're
[2:39:51.380 --> 2:39:58.260]  beginning to see as we're pulling back and we're becoming more successful in exposing the neocons
[2:39:58.260 --> 2:40:05.860]  and exposing the maria entoinette in exposing the incompetence of the cia the incompetence of the
[2:40:05.860 --> 2:40:12.900]  secret service of the fbi the department of justice what's happened is the only recourse they have
[2:40:12.900 --> 2:40:19.620]  is for their mechanisms and their outlets to shut down shows that were very important and
[2:40:19.620 --> 2:40:27.700]  reaffirming a very objective concept she is sick there is no question about it the problem i said
[2:40:27.700 --> 2:40:35.060]  and that dr drew said and many other board examiners said release the records from columbia pns
[2:40:35.060 --> 2:40:42.420]  if you've been hospitalized for months on end you have mri's and cat scans that indicate she has
[2:40:42.420 --> 2:40:48.340]  brain damage she has physical and mental problems and the drum beats got stronger and i agree i agree
[2:40:48.340 --> 2:40:52.900]  uncannily what you said on air is going to be a roadmap for all these other doctors to have courage
[2:40:52.900 --> 2:40:57.620]  clearly they were attacking you when they attacked me so so what does that signify and now looking at
[2:40:57.620 --> 2:41:02.420]  her again i'm on a doctor like you but it looks i mean she looks like she's deteriorating quickly
[2:41:02.420 --> 2:41:09.940]  well the point of fact is that the american public now the the veterans from iraq and afghanistan
[2:41:09.940 --> 2:41:16.180]  have to stand up as a group and say we cannot accept her as a candidate for the presidency of
[2:41:16.180 --> 2:41:24.260]  the united states we cannot accept zalmay hallazad or a steve hadley or another neocon to represent
[2:41:24.260 --> 2:41:31.060]  us or anybody in the bush clinton entourage to come forth to be our leaders and that's where you
[2:41:31.060 --> 2:41:37.300]  we have been very successful in the american public has to now protest it in such a way
[2:41:37.300 --> 2:41:42.500]  that they can have a very beautiful revolution they can have very peaceful protests but here
[2:41:42.500 --> 2:41:47.220]  comes the next problem they may try exactly dot i'm turning so how do you see them striking back
[2:41:47.220 --> 2:41:52.900]  a false flag on the tip of the assassination i see demonstrations i see women who have incredible
[2:41:52.900 --> 2:42:00.340]  signs about hillary and her incompetence and the uh and the despicable behavior of a husband
[2:42:00.340 --> 2:42:08.180]  i see trump coming back and hitting them again and again and again i see bernie sanders coming out
[2:42:08.180 --> 2:42:13.140]  and saying again what he should have said all along which he has said this is a corrupt i was
[2:42:13.140 --> 2:42:16.740]  about to say what does it signify that he rolled over for months and is suddenly coming out against
[2:42:16.740 --> 2:42:23.700]  her well you know that's a good point alex i have a lot of respect for bernie i don't know him i
[2:42:23.700 --> 2:42:30.180]  heard him in new hampshire but you know he is a online jewish socialist from berkeley but he
[2:42:30.180 --> 2:42:36.340]  represented a very important part of those young people who i expect them to demonstrate in the
[2:42:36.340 --> 2:42:45.220]  streets because he realized he made a concession which was very poorly uh uh executed and in fact
[2:42:45.220 --> 2:42:51.540]  he was co-opted by hillary whatever concession he made to her she defaulted on it and i think
[2:42:51.540 --> 2:42:57.540]  bernie should come back in and reassert the concepts that he said and reaffirm the fact
[2:42:57.540 --> 2:43:03.940]  that he has to have his millenials protest against a person like hillary a marianne
[2:43:03.940 --> 2:43:09.540]  twanette come back into the i agree if sanders came out he said i can never come back bernie is
[2:43:09.540 --> 2:43:14.660]  an important part of this if sanders came out and said hillary stole the election stole the
[2:43:14.660 --> 2:43:20.820]  nomination it'd be it for hillary he said he said the business was rigged trump said the business
[2:43:20.820 --> 2:43:28.100]  was rigged trump exactly understood what you and i did that bernie is the exact opposite and the
[2:43:28.100 --> 2:43:34.340]  mirror image of him and they want the same thing one can build the condo the other one has to pay
[2:43:34.340 --> 2:43:38.420]  dr bernie i know i know you want to stay on the offensive and that's always great and good and
[2:43:38.420 --> 2:43:43.780]  you're talking to a general audience but but but specifically though let's talk about how we expect
[2:43:43.780 --> 2:43:49.220]  the neocons the globalists the george soros is to strike back i'm really worried about an assassination
[2:43:49.220 --> 2:43:53.540]  attempt on hillary whether it's successful or not making her a victim if i was them i'd be looking
[2:43:53.540 --> 2:43:57.780]  at that obviously we don't want any harm against her i'd be looking at some type of economic deal
[2:43:57.780 --> 2:44:02.820]  or maybe a new little war uh i mean if you were working for the other team what well one of the
[2:44:02.820 --> 2:44:08.100]  things that i'm getting out of that seems to be out of control is the zika virus nonsense i mean
[2:44:08.100 --> 2:44:14.980]  you know for a virus to come out of brazil and then contaminate miami beach and and affect i
[2:44:14.980 --> 2:44:20.020]  understand it affects women who have children but beyond that no one's going to get gion beret
[2:44:20.020 --> 2:44:26.180]  syndrome i mean we have a lot of you know issues that are at hand zika virus is not one of them
[2:44:26.180 --> 2:44:31.060]  the economy is the second probably the most that's my next question what do you make of
[2:44:31.060 --> 2:44:38.420]  Saudi Arabia dad is that our people have to request that our our soldiers come back from
[2:44:38.420 --> 2:44:44.900]  africa from iraq and syria we never had a state of war declared the president has
[2:44:44.900 --> 2:44:53.060]  has no right to send the national guard of florida into jabuti in africa i don't need to lose young
[2:44:53.060 --> 2:44:57.620]  christian men and women into a war that has no nationalist i've got another question we gotta
[2:44:57.620 --> 2:45:03.220]  move quick what do you make of the claim that uh obama is negotiating around the clock with
[2:45:03.220 --> 2:45:08.580]  putin to join him against ices isn't that just a way to cover up the fact of hillary and him uh
[2:45:08.580 --> 2:45:15.060]  that put obama is finished basically what's happening is our forces there whether they be
[2:45:15.060 --> 2:45:20.100]  mercenaries or whatever work with the russians we've worked very closely with the russians
[2:45:20.100 --> 2:45:26.020]  ices is being degraded but not because of obama but because they have it i don't know no he knows
[2:45:26.020 --> 2:45:31.780]  his little move was defeated and so now he wants to act like as a legacy he jumped in to stop it
[2:45:31.780 --> 2:45:37.460]  yeah but he has no legacy there's absolutely no legacy for obama it's gone it's just a black
[2:45:37.460 --> 2:45:42.820]  man who came in for eight years and disappeared he's the invisible black man that's all he was
[2:45:44.020 --> 2:45:50.740]  and there's no legacy ices is gone absolutely uh and and again clearly ices was a proxy army of
[2:45:50.740 --> 2:45:57.140]  some of the gulf states elements of natalia the cia what we need in next administration is defunding
[2:45:57.140 --> 2:46:02.500]  of the cia and a michael flint to take over to make sure that we don't have civilians who go out
[2:46:02.500 --> 2:46:06.900]  of control for the past well sure isn't the answer because all the context of cia has just taken over
[2:46:07.860 --> 2:46:13.780]  well the cia is it took what happened it i'll be very frank john brennan who was the
[2:46:13.780 --> 2:46:19.780]  disaster is the ddo in saudi arabia came out and instead of taking humance that is collecting
[2:46:19.780 --> 2:46:26.420]  intelligence and understanding the culture and psychological dimensions decided to uh co-op
[2:46:26.420 --> 2:46:32.420]  what we call so-comp special operations that command and use them for drone warfare in other
[2:46:32.420 --> 2:46:36.580]  words we don't have any more which makes everybody hates you see what they don't get about humed is
[2:46:36.580 --> 2:46:40.980]  it's not just you can have electronic intelligence they think humed is just gathering intelligence
[2:46:40.980 --> 2:46:45.860]  humed is winning hearts and minds you remove that and run around bombing people but that's
[2:46:45.860 --> 2:46:51.460]  the way you turn people against the country that's exactly i mean the essence of any war the essence
[2:46:51.460 --> 2:46:58.260]  of any success is understanding the enemy or the people and their culture we have not done very well
[2:46:58.260 --> 2:47:03.300]  and that's been a serious problem we have but it seems like sabotage they've got to know doing
[2:47:03.300 --> 2:47:07.460]  that would sabotage the us i smell something bigger here and i know you always say it's an
[2:47:07.460 --> 2:47:11.620]  aptitude and i agree there's a lot of that but at a certain point they're undermining the us
[2:47:11.620 --> 2:47:16.820]  they're destroying our institutions they're destroying our power it's clear this is sabotage
[2:47:16.820 --> 2:47:23.940]  well let me put it this way i know you think it's sabotage i call it so gross and confident
[2:47:23.940 --> 2:47:30.260]  that 16 different units can't even integrate themselves and we're spending tons of millions
[2:47:30.260 --> 2:47:35.300]  and trillions of dollars trying to figure out what's going on yet we have no unified so it's
[2:47:35.300 --> 2:47:40.740]  mainly living with james clapper that's not enough sure what we need is to clear out this
[2:47:40.740 --> 2:47:46.100]  entire system to have a sweeper and that's the kind of guy that michael in would come in he
[2:47:46.100 --> 2:47:49.620]  knows exactly what the problem is yeah what'd you make a trump saying i don't want to meet with the
[2:47:49.620 --> 2:47:53.860]  cia they'll just lie to me and then harry reid goes oh yeah well we lie to the american people
[2:47:53.860 --> 2:47:58.900]  we'll just give him fake briefings and trump goes exactly dumbass i've got the army advising me i
[2:47:58.900 --> 2:48:05.460]  don't need worked in a house of prostitution before he became a Mormon well he's obviously an
[2:48:05.460 --> 2:48:11.540]  officer let me ask you this question though i mean clearly look how the things trump says and
[2:48:11.540 --> 2:48:15.060]  the things he does are so smart he's like i don't want briefings from the cia i don't want a bunch
[2:48:15.060 --> 2:48:19.940]  of bull he knows what the problem is but he's got to clear out christie's got to clear out ben
[2:48:19.940 --> 2:48:25.460]  carson he's got to clear out all the neil cons and he has to understand that the government that we
[2:48:26.020 --> 2:48:30.420]  that we have it has to be cleaned out i mean one of the most important things in the first
[2:48:30.420 --> 2:48:37.460]  100 days is to literally shut down institutions and fire right and left sure why why is the
[2:48:37.460 --> 2:48:40.660]  establishment so scared of trump i mean for me that's the biggest endorsement because that's
[2:48:40.660 --> 2:48:45.780]  exactly what they can do because they don't have a hold one of the key elements alex and i think your
[2:48:45.780 --> 2:48:51.860]  audience has to understand this one of the key elements in intelligence or politics is the ability
[2:48:51.860 --> 2:48:58.180]  to manipulate and create vulnerability you want vulnerability in your enemy and your allies so you
[2:48:58.180 --> 2:49:04.660]  can manipulate them the clinton's have a whole list of issues on everybody involved with them
[2:49:04.660 --> 2:49:09.860]  they know exactly how to expose them with a guy like obama who had a homosexual history
[2:49:09.860 --> 2:49:14.980]  in chicago they know all about him they know all about his mother they know all about the fact
[2:49:14.980 --> 2:49:21.860]  he's cia came out of oxydental and came up hillary clinton a history of lesbian activities a history
[2:49:21.860 --> 2:49:29.860]  of you know corruption these are the things that we know but the system clearly wants to deny it so
[2:49:29.860 --> 2:49:36.020]  what they have is manipulation and and a co-optation of manipulation that's all it is it's part of
[2:49:36.020 --> 2:49:41.620]  pandering it's part of the ascendancy the power and that's what you have to have a people who have
[2:49:41.620 --> 2:49:46.500]  no relationship to them who are not beholden to them and that's why i came in and out of
[2:49:46.500 --> 2:49:52.260]  administrations i never stayed in one administration i never accepted a pension i never accepted a
[2:49:52.260 --> 2:49:57.060]  promotion in the military so there was nothing they could do for me if they wanted me it's because
[2:49:57.060 --> 2:50:03.460]  what i could bring to them but the reality is i didn't need them they needed me more and now
[2:50:03.460 --> 2:50:08.740]  the issue is what can we do in america to make sure we're no longer vulnerable to this kind of
[2:50:08.740 --> 2:50:14.260]  nonsense absolutely because these people are out of control and you can smell their end is coming
[2:50:14.260 --> 2:50:19.140]  the problem is well but alex part of what you're doing and a great part of what you're doing is
[2:50:19.140 --> 2:50:25.620]  is is the spearhead of cutting through again and we need to keep going because the election will
[2:50:25.620 --> 2:50:31.220]  be rigged there's no question about it it is totally rigged contrary to what i gotta skip
[2:50:31.220 --> 2:50:34.100]  this break this is too important even though it won't even be a network of these people take
[2:50:34.100 --> 2:50:39.060]  over so it doesn't matter we're all in now clearly they're bringing in multinationals
[2:50:39.060 --> 2:50:42.580]  they went from saying there's no such thing as election fraud to now we're going to save it
[2:50:42.580 --> 2:50:45.860]  with homeland security running it that's what roger showed us that a month before they did that he
[2:50:45.860 --> 2:50:50.580]  said alex watch they're going to quote keep it from being a fraud they're going to protect the
[2:50:50.580 --> 2:50:54.660]  election that's who does it and now they're going to have justice department computer teams
[2:50:54.660 --> 2:51:00.260]  hooked in lovingly monitoring everyone giant foxes guarding the headhouse from the imaginary
[2:51:00.260 --> 2:51:05.860]  russians who can't even hardly keep their electricity on right now with the gdp of idli uh and so
[2:51:05.860 --> 2:51:09.620]  now you're you know you're stating yes you think it's going to be rigged with them now responding
[2:51:09.620 --> 2:51:13.540]  they've got to protect it how do we counter that how do we get donald trump in what would you say
[2:51:13.540 --> 2:51:18.180]  is we don't want you anywhere near then we have what you call for an independent uh uh
[2:51:18.180 --> 2:51:23.700]  electoral volunteers we don't need the justice department there is no justice it's not a department
[2:51:23.700 --> 2:51:28.820]  we don't need homeland security i agree but how naked is it to have obama saying there's no such
[2:51:28.820 --> 2:51:33.460]  thing as fraud but now he's got to come take control of it to keep it safe stupid is as stupid
[2:51:33.460 --> 2:51:40.420]  does obama is irrelevant now he's just an ignorant individual who came to power thanks to the cia
[2:51:40.420 --> 2:51:45.380]  but he's irrelevant now the america so is he just one more guy with this little government badge
[2:51:45.380 --> 2:51:50.900]  that just runs and thinks that's like he's god well it's not relevant anymore if we ignore him
[2:51:50.900 --> 2:51:55.140]  all he has to do is write his books but the truth of the matters you hit on the key point
[2:51:55.140 --> 2:52:00.420]  which is to get the volunteers all of us out there to the electoral booth to make sure we
[2:52:00.420 --> 2:52:06.100]  can see people voting and make sure that we take information as they came out as to who voted all
[2:52:06.100 --> 2:52:09.700]  right let me do this let's say let's say donald trump here's five minutes of the show today
[2:52:10.660 --> 2:52:14.180]  dr cbc i'm gonna let you go and i appreciate your time and i hand the baton to paul watson with a
[2:52:14.180 --> 2:52:19.940]  big fourth hour coming up i mean his engines are on they're right on all pistons are you know firing
[2:52:19.940 --> 2:52:24.420]  steve ashenik you're talking to donald trump are you talking to his crew you're talking to his
[2:52:24.420 --> 2:52:30.340]  advisors right now what would you say to donald trump i would say get rid of christy get rid of
[2:52:30.340 --> 2:52:36.740]  ben carson clear out your whole transition team let me see who's on it in terms of foreign policy
[2:52:36.740 --> 2:52:43.780]  avoid any neocons steve hadley salmi holizade anyone else now when you go into the debate
[2:52:43.780 --> 2:52:48.180]  you can call the shots you can determine whether you want to walk off stage whether you want to
[2:52:48.180 --> 2:52:55.140]  make it five minutes ten minutes do not let the reporters determine your outcome on your debate the
[2:52:55.140 --> 2:53:01.700]  debate now is yours you can do whatever you want with it if it conflicts with the nfl then refuse
[2:53:01.700 --> 2:53:07.060]  to come on board because it's not going to change anything the second thing i would do is to hit
[2:53:07.060 --> 2:53:14.260]  hillary on every issue that she is vulnerable the 156 000 an hour the fact that she hasn't
[2:53:14.260 --> 2:53:21.060]  accomplished anything not anything as a senator not one bill she accomplished nothing libya failed
[2:53:21.060 --> 2:53:26.020]  state turned isis loose to kill hundreds of thousands of syria only that you know what she
[2:53:26.020 --> 2:53:32.180]  did even in the clinton foundation they contributed to the death of 10 000 Haitian
[2:53:32.740 --> 2:53:38.660]  innocent Haitian people who i love and i've worked with because they brought in nepalese
[2:53:38.660 --> 2:53:45.060]  un keep peacekeepers and the un was guilty of this crime did you see the fbi did you see the
[2:53:45.060 --> 2:53:51.780]  international criminal court come after them no but chelsea even said that this was a case of gross
[2:53:51.780 --> 2:53:58.420]  negligence of her mother and father yet not one mention was made 10 000 Haitians were killed
[2:53:58.420 --> 2:54:04.820]  because the clintons went down there and couldn't organize an effective cleanup and instead the
[2:54:04.820 --> 2:54:12.820]  nepalese used the water system to defecate in there and and the secretary general of the un
[2:54:12.820 --> 2:54:18.660]  who's south korean is not held accountable the un is not held accountable and so now let's be
[2:54:18.660 --> 2:54:24.180]  clear the un comes sets up a water treatment and then crap said it you got it that was i
[2:54:24.180 --> 2:54:29.220]  didn't want to use that but you used it that's correct so they've killed people the other thing
[2:54:29.220 --> 2:54:34.340]  that was brought out and trump has to bring it out it was hillary who told bill clinton not to
[2:54:34.340 --> 2:54:40.900]  intercede in the genocide at ruan that's right then bill clinton's in africa he's not in africa
[2:54:40.900 --> 2:54:47.700]  because he cares about the africans or he gives a damn about him he cares because he was convicted
[2:54:47.700 --> 2:54:54.820]  indirectly by me and others of having killed because of gross negligence a million who to
[2:54:54.820 --> 2:55:01.140]  entuce these who were they were he was warned about it sandy burger was warned months beforehand
[2:55:01.140 --> 2:55:07.700]  that the chinese had machetes the french themselves had machine guns when they shot down the tutsis
[2:55:07.700 --> 2:55:13.300]  the french did this and the french didn't take any responsibility nor did the belgium
[2:55:13.300 --> 2:55:19.220]  but this was hillard clinton telling bill don't get involved and instead what did he do he bombed
[2:55:19.220 --> 2:55:26.340]  syria for what reasons absolutely none so he had a most incompetent general west quark of the air
[2:55:26.340 --> 2:55:33.700]  force send a bunch of bombers in there but when he had to act or she had to act people died they died
[2:55:33.700 --> 2:55:40.500]  again and again and again we could no longer afford that and america will stand up in a revolution
[2:55:40.500 --> 2:55:45.780]  a quiet revolution but it will be a revolution i agree and and just keep hammering the fact
[2:55:45.780 --> 2:55:50.020]  that he just represents this huge populist movement to bring nationalism and the renaissance
[2:55:50.020 --> 2:55:56.340]  he is the revolution i would also point out that the first moderator they've got is admittedly part
[2:55:56.340 --> 2:56:00.900]  of her foundation and and and of course others they're announcing are also have been caught
[2:56:00.900 --> 2:56:04.420]  working for the clinton's so if i was trump i'd just say this moderator right here so i just
[2:56:04.420 --> 2:56:09.140]  want to say right now at the start uh is a fraud and works for hillary it's that correct that it's
[2:56:09.140 --> 2:56:13.860]  that type of devastating move that goes right after their arrogance up front though first thing
[2:56:13.860 --> 2:56:18.260]  first off i just want to say matt lauer you work for hillary on an international foundation so you
[2:56:18.260 --> 2:56:22.980]  should recuse yourself i'm just pointing that out when you pull stuff today you give me equal time
[2:56:22.980 --> 2:56:29.060]  and everybody just watch him anderson cooper i mean is that a joke was that not a joke i mean i
[2:56:29.060 --> 2:56:35.460]  know he was trained by the cia spent a couple of years in the summers in the cia he he talks about
[2:56:35.460 --> 2:56:41.380]  the most absurd things and sandy hook and nine eleven and then come and attacks us this is
[2:56:41.380 --> 2:56:47.300]  anderson cooper come on give me a break i mean he's kind of a cute little boy he's not even
[2:56:47.300 --> 2:56:53.940]  a man who can really ask serious questions their narcissism has to be controlled and manipulated
[2:56:53.940 --> 2:56:59.220]  by trump he gets it none of this should be acceptable to him but it's the american people
[2:56:59.220 --> 2:57:02.180]  how does he do that let's say with cooper as a moderator i mean what do you just point out
[2:57:02.180 --> 2:57:09.940]  oh it's the little uh blue blood uh what is it aster or is it uh uh it's a uh yeah it's aster
[2:57:09.940 --> 2:57:15.620]  is it uh i forget what's royal no it's the uh yeah yeah i know it's not the aster always flip it
[2:57:15.620 --> 2:57:20.260]  it's the uh vanderbilt vanderbilt vanderbilt oh the little vanderbilt there was nothing more than
[2:57:20.260 --> 2:57:24.980]  the dutch demon you know they make up their own sure so i mean how would you just in psychological
[2:57:24.980 --> 2:57:28.820]  warfare go after the moderator what would you say like oh you work for hillary's foundation
[2:57:28.820 --> 2:57:33.460]  how how impartial just want to point that out up front or or like uh what would you say to cooper
[2:57:33.460 --> 2:57:38.020]  oh mr cooper do you tell your audience you were in the cia or you know or that you're a big donor
[2:57:38.020 --> 2:57:42.420]  to the clinton correct i mean you know it's the kind of information and psyops you can
[2:57:42.420 --> 2:57:49.780]  the deny the store or deflect it's up to him to decide what he wants to do or have it but put him
[2:57:49.780 --> 2:57:54.740]  on the hot seat like saying listen don't tell me guns are causing the mass murder it's the psychotropics
[2:57:54.740 --> 2:58:01.300]  that are your main sponsors um pierce that's correct i mean there there isn't one there that
[2:58:01.300 --> 2:58:07.060]  is an open i mean what they did was to pick one of diversity and it was their own people so you
[2:58:07.060 --> 2:58:11.540]  know i was saying regardless of who it is these people are jokes and they're wide open uh dr

[3:01:36.500 --> 3:01:40.500]  and these are already the very best gravity filters out there we carry like four different
[3:01:40.500 --> 3:01:44.820]  brands summer apples and oranges some are better than this some are better than that but they're
[3:01:44.820 --> 3:01:48.900]  all excellent gravity fed that cut out the fluoride and the glyphosate and hundreds and hundreds of
[3:01:48.900 --> 3:01:53.220]  other things or reduce it down to non detectable levels or nine nine nine nine nine the point is
[3:01:53.780 --> 3:01:57.300]  there are a lot of filters out there that cost as much as these just take out the bad taste

[3:02:15.220 --> 3:02:19.380]  and i know sometimes the broadcast is a train wreck and we have an amazing crew doing this whole
[3:02:19.380 --> 3:02:24.100]  show live for three four hours every day three hours of myself four hours we count the guest
[3:02:24.100 --> 3:02:34.660]  every day that does the fourth hour and it's stressful but i understand how big the stakes are
[3:02:34.660 --> 3:02:39.860]  so i am honored to be here but don't ever think that i don't know that sometimes i'm a train wreck
[3:02:39.860 --> 3:02:43.780]  but there are those moments where we really have the big effect and we see what we're doing
[3:02:43.780 --> 3:02:47.860]  having a huge global effect and quite frankly it's becoming more and more common so i'm just
[3:02:47.860 --> 3:02:52.260]  honored to be associated with all of you i'm very very appreciative i say i've got the best crew
[3:02:52.260 --> 3:02:57.380]  i've ever had hands down we get better over the years things are more stressful we do a lot more
[3:02:57.380 --> 3:03:02.020]  you get better we've had a lot of great crew over the years as well you know people that have come
[3:03:02.020 --> 3:03:06.980]  and gone for whatever reasons sometimes we have a reporter and then they've got a family member that's
[3:03:06.980 --> 3:03:13.460]  sick in new york so they move back or you know uh that type of stuff happens but everybody that
[3:03:13.460 --> 3:03:18.340]  i've worked with and you the listeners are just such an important part of this whole operation
[3:03:18.340 --> 3:03:23.620]  take jacari jackson he was here four years and before he worked here he he had a dream to you
[3:03:23.620 --> 3:03:28.580]  know be a comic book publisher and he told me hey i'm looking to do this on the road and so
[3:03:28.580 --> 3:03:33.380]  you know jacari has gone to do that now but the work he's done battling the new world order i don't
[3:03:33.380 --> 3:03:39.780]  blame him after four four tours in the info war wanting to do something else uh and so you know
[3:03:39.780 --> 3:03:44.820]  jacari's moved on but it doesn't matter what he's done here will always especially the video
[3:03:44.820 --> 3:03:48.260]  intros he's done are some of the best very talented will still be part of the show as long as the
[3:03:48.260 --> 3:03:54.420]  broadcast goes on that's what it's all about i quite frankly after 25 years in the trenches 21
[3:03:54.420 --> 3:03:59.060]  years on air i would like to ride off in the sunset sometime i don't i don't hate my job i love it
[3:03:59.060 --> 3:04:05.780]  it's just that there's so much to cover so much to do that i just don't even feel like i'm up to
[3:04:05.780 --> 3:04:11.380]  this incredible challenge sometimes i mean because i'm a humble person and i know for a fact
[3:04:12.500 --> 3:04:17.860]  sent com and south com listen i know for a fact current top generals do i know for a fact donald
[3:04:17.860 --> 3:04:23.780]  trump does i know for a i mean i'm talking a lot i know for a fact foreign leaders do
[3:04:23.780 --> 3:04:27.140]  and it's like wow why did anybody else see this narrative why didn't anybody else read
[3:04:27.140 --> 3:04:31.540]  what the globalists are up to well most people just get into politics or get in the military
[3:04:31.540 --> 3:04:36.020]  that's do their job they focus on the issues that are put out there by the newspaper not realizing
[3:04:36.020 --> 3:04:42.660]  the globalists have created a whole false template a whole false grid a false reality to blind us from
[3:04:42.660 --> 3:04:48.740]  what's really going on and info wars is just a hole in that electronic berlin wall curtain letting
[3:04:48.740 --> 3:04:54.100]  sunlight in so i want to thank you all for your support but it's not just hiring new reporters
[3:04:54.100 --> 3:05:00.420]  to expand it's hiring new crew for some of the attrition that takes place joe bigs here with

[3:08:31.220 --> 3:08:38.420]  effects they admit it in fear and i try to talk to the average man around me who doesn't you know
[3:08:38.420 --> 3:08:43.140]  working this fight they're just like oblivious and ask you what i think about fantasy football and
[3:08:43.140 --> 3:08:48.340]  tailgating and i'm like dude i don't want to sit around tailgates getting drunk eating barbecue
[3:08:48.980 --> 3:08:54.100]  the mosquitoes biting me in texas heat of 95 degrees i mean you know i mean there's a world
[3:08:54.100 --> 3:08:58.980]  government they're putting cancer viruses and vaccines they admit that they're having drones
[3:08:59.700 --> 3:09:06.740]  a google drone car spying on the police the technocracies taking over we've got all this
[3:09:06.740 --> 3:09:15.060]  media censorship going on world government's coming into place where is this the self-preservation
[3:09:15.700 --> 3:09:20.420]  now paul joseph watching joins us from the studios in london for some reason or i guess he's in
[3:09:20.420 --> 3:09:30.020]  france today for some reason uh 007 doesn't have video links today so uh he he he joins us now
[3:09:30.020 --> 3:09:35.060]  via audio i'm gonna hand the baton to him here in a second but paul what do you make of this
[3:09:35.060 --> 3:09:38.260]  bizarreness well i'm gonna go shoot a video today would do on this that we're gonna have done
[3:09:38.980 --> 3:09:44.420]  for the nightly news or if not it'll be done for the show tomorrow where we have obama saying
[3:09:44.420 --> 3:09:49.700]  there's no such thing as election fraud but now we have the un and the and the e you and the judge
[3:09:49.700 --> 3:09:54.820]  department coming in to take it over because the russians are running it i mean this is getting
[3:09:54.820 --> 3:10:00.820]  ridiculous this is getting crazy town uh that they've now reached this level and what's even
[3:10:00.820 --> 3:10:05.700]  wilder is you know we kicked the ball off with that report about election fraud and trump's
[3:10:05.700 --> 3:10:10.580]  making a major issue he did make it the major issue and they seem to be crapping their pants
[3:10:10.580 --> 3:10:16.820]  and then icing on the top is a hillary cannot talk anywhere now three different press talks
[3:10:17.540 --> 3:10:21.380]  and none of them are real press conferences one was a crowd of people one was her sick of fans on
[3:10:21.380 --> 3:10:26.420]  a plane and then one was talking to a single reporter she can't stop coughing for 20 seconds
[3:10:26.420 --> 3:10:35.300]  what is going on well alex i mean the backlash from this latest bout of coughing fits has really
[3:10:35.300 --> 3:10:40.180]  come to the fore today you've got the washington post coming out with an article about an hour or
[3:10:40.180 --> 3:10:45.700]  two ago and you know we've had people we have people every day getting really but hurt about
[3:10:45.700 --> 3:10:51.140]  matt drudge's headlines and who he links to but now the washington post has basically devoted an
[3:10:51.140 --> 3:10:57.540]  entire article whining about who matt drudge links to it's called can we just stop talking about
[3:10:57.540 --> 3:11:04.500]  hillary clinton's health now and it basically goes through tries to make the claim let me
[3:11:04.500 --> 3:11:09.140]  find the exact word that's like we found a dead body when you came home and then your wife says
[3:11:09.140 --> 3:11:13.860]  let's not call the police to stop talking about the dead body she's like a fish out of water
[3:11:13.860 --> 3:11:18.580]  crashing and burning hacking and coughing and stumbling around claiming the russians
[3:11:18.580 --> 3:11:24.580]  have invaded i mean this woman is a fruit basket i mean i mean you talk about conspiracy theories
[3:11:24.580 --> 3:11:31.540]  the fact that the russians are running the us resistance to george soros sticking his thumb
[3:11:31.540 --> 3:11:38.340]  up our rear end i mean they that is crazy it's a complete meltdown hillary claimed that
[3:11:38.340 --> 3:11:44.020]  pootin was running the alt right i mean that was the pinnacle of it this article says oh
[3:11:44.020 --> 3:11:49.940]  these concerns are completely ridiculous because hillary's personal internist produced a letter
[3:11:49.940 --> 3:11:55.060]  to say that hillary was fine so because her personal physician said she was fine and hillary
[3:11:55.060 --> 3:11:58.820]  said she didn't have any emails remember there was there there wasn't three years ago there wasn't
[3:11:58.820 --> 3:12:05.940]  even a second server paul but then it goes on to say why aren't we talking about trump's health
[3:12:05.940 --> 3:12:11.220]  trump's doctor wrote a letter and that letter's suspicious so a letter from a personal physician
[3:12:11.220 --> 3:12:15.940]  that's good enough for hillary but a letter from trump's doctor that's suspicious that's
[3:12:15.940 --> 3:12:20.660]  underhanded we have to research that remember they said it was sexist to talk about hillary
[3:12:20.660 --> 3:12:25.620]  clinton's health the same media that obsessed about john mccain's health all throughout the
[3:12:25.620 --> 3:12:31.780]  2008 election cycle let me ask let me ask your britannic majesty this question then
[3:12:33.300 --> 3:12:37.460]  that's paul's secret nickname her britannic i'm i'm a stop paul seriously what do you think
[3:12:37.460 --> 3:12:42.740]  is really going on with hillary because she clearly is degrading fast she can't talk 30 seconds
[3:12:42.740 --> 3:12:48.980]  without absolutely she's dying i mean that's associated with heart failure congestive heart
[3:12:48.980 --> 3:12:54.500]  failure and different arrhythmias i mean we we showed mainstream news admitting that what do
[3:12:54.500 --> 3:13:00.820]  you think is going on with hillary i think she had a a more severe stroke and she did have a stroke
[3:13:00.820 --> 3:13:07.380]  than they're admitting to back in 2012 the fact that they were researching pro-vigil in the hillary
[3:13:07.380 --> 3:13:12.580]  clinton emails the leaked emails shows that they were concerned about parkinson's i mean she could
[3:13:12.580 --> 3:13:17.780]  have early stage parkinson's they could know that she's degenerate yeah she asked about a parkinson's
[3:13:17.780 --> 3:13:22.420]  drug so but but but we should ask that question no that's a conspiracy theory even though it's
[3:13:22.420 --> 3:13:28.740]  in the actual emails it's a conspiracy hold on paul i'm getting a call yes latimer poot
[3:13:30.180 --> 3:13:34.980]  talk about talk about how hillary is coughing okay well oh you're making her cough from a
[3:13:34.980 --> 3:13:42.980]  satellite in space i thank you thank you thank you sir oh latimer poot says hi paul he says good job
[3:13:43.860 --> 3:13:47.460]  i haven't received that paycheck from the kremlin yet thank you your excellency
[3:13:48.980 --> 3:13:53.620]  listen to this out of the washington post though this is a quote from this article why can't we
[3:13:53.620 --> 3:13:59.060]  stop talking about hillary's health quote the simple fact is there is zero evidence that anything is
[3:13:59.060 --> 3:14:03.780]  seriously wrong with clinton if suffering an occasional coughing fit is evidence of a major
[3:14:03.780 --> 3:14:09.140]  health problem then 75 percent of the country must have that mystery illness and i'm one of them
[3:14:09.140 --> 3:14:14.500]  right so they're claiming that to have a four and a half five minute coughing fit on a regular
[3:14:14.500 --> 3:14:20.260]  routine basis is completely normal and then to have another one an hour later on the airplane
[3:14:21.220 --> 3:14:25.860]  trump has given way more speeches way more press conferences than hillary clinton
[3:14:25.860 --> 3:14:30.900]  he's never suffered one of these coughing fits he's two years older than her this is obviously
[3:14:30.900 --> 3:14:36.980]  related to a health problem you can't claim it's normal and claim that 75 percent of the country
[3:14:36.980 --> 3:14:41.620]  sure sure we're winning this debate she obviously said brain surgery the word is a brain tumor was
[3:14:41.620 --> 3:14:46.580]  cut out it's growing back where do they go from here kane is like creeping around the background
[3:14:46.580 --> 3:14:50.100]  look complete tim kane the senator looked completely freaked out during the video in
[3:14:50.100 --> 3:14:56.260]  cleveland what do you think's going on paul well obviously it's going to clear the path for kane
[3:14:56.260 --> 3:15:01.460]  to take the top spot if that's what happens but now they're coming out and saying that
[3:15:01.460 --> 3:15:06.420]  there's not enough pro hillary media bias i mean you had that picture yesterday heard
[3:15:06.420 --> 3:15:11.300]  you know her sycophants on the plane they literally looked like they were enraptured
[3:15:11.300 --> 3:15:17.220]  tweens waiting to meet taylor swift for the first time they look like starving dogs looking at giant
[3:15:17.220 --> 3:15:23.460]  chops of beef yeah people go on about hillary not having a press conference of 275 days on out
[3:15:23.460 --> 3:15:28.580]  whatever it is i mean what good would it really do at this point they had chances to ask her
[3:15:28.580 --> 3:15:32.580]  questions they asked her they said how was your weekend and then they started talking about
[3:15:32.580 --> 3:15:38.260]  guantanamo bay i mean you've got all these questions swirling about her emails her health
[3:15:38.260 --> 3:15:45.060]  they ask absolutely no relevant questions it's no surprise that you know 94 percent of americans
[3:15:45.060 --> 3:15:49.700]  distrust the mainstream media and that's why they don't ask real questions
[3:15:49.700 --> 3:15:56.980]  well i'm going to turn the baton over to you as i like to say but uh first here's a photo of them
[3:15:56.980 --> 3:16:01.620]  fawning there's video of it uh as well but tb viewers and full wars dot com forward slash
[3:16:01.620 --> 3:16:05.060]  show can find that what else is coming up today i know you've got a big video you've worked hours
[3:16:05.060 --> 3:16:10.820]  on today uh dealing with gary johnson i'm telling you when gary johnson was last here he sat in
[3:16:10.820 --> 3:16:16.580]  the corner pissing at me like a gremlin that had been fed after midnight uh and i was really but i
[3:16:16.580 --> 3:16:20.660]  thought he was like mentally ill or something other people noticed it and he basically hissed
[3:16:20.660 --> 3:16:26.500]  out of the building like hopping along or something what in the hell is going on i mean again does
[3:16:26.500 --> 3:16:33.460]  somebody feed him after midnight over the past four years he's basically turned into a social
[3:16:33.460 --> 3:16:38.820]  justice warrior alex you talk about vaccines he said the government should have the right to
[3:16:38.820 --> 3:16:44.500]  forcibly inject people i forgot that forced injections global government tpp open borders
[3:16:44.500 --> 3:16:50.340]  as vp wants to ban guns he only wants to restrict them and the libertarian party has uh at least
[3:16:50.340 --> 3:16:55.060]  a court of the mainstream media worship scene what does that tell you well exactly now you've
[3:16:55.060 --> 3:17:00.020]  got all these top celebrities endorsing him and the key point is you know in places like
[3:17:00.020 --> 3:17:05.380]  arizona he could take enough votes away from trump to hand hillary a victory gary johnson is
[3:17:06.260 --> 3:17:13.220]  very easily defied enemy of the republic yeah he's basically a triggered social justice warrior i
[3:17:13.220 --> 3:17:18.340]  mean it wasn't just the illegal immigrant term it's basically everything his personal behavior
[3:17:18.340 --> 3:17:23.700]  is completely bizarre he looks like he's smoking too much of the weed and i'm telling you i'm
[3:17:23.700 --> 3:17:27.300]  telling you i'm listen i'm not exactly i talked about this privately i may have even told you
[3:17:27.300 --> 3:17:30.820]  but i talked for off and on for years he hadn't been here in almost three years because when he
[3:17:30.820 --> 3:17:35.300]  was here he'd been there many six seven eight times in person every ten times or more you know over
[3:17:35.300 --> 3:17:40.340]  the phone when he was here he acted like a freaking lunatic and like a creeper and i'm like
[3:17:40.340 --> 3:17:46.980]  yeah and he seems to yeah yeah go ahead i mean he seems to be obscene seems to be obsessed about
[3:17:46.980 --> 3:17:52.820]  mountain bike riding and calling people pussies while being a complete hypocrite he said that
[3:17:53.380 --> 3:17:58.900]  jewish bakeries should be forced to make nazi wedding cakes he wants a carbon tax he wants
[3:17:58.900 --> 3:18:03.780]  to create a huge owner as government bureaucracy well he's definitely been led in the bill
[3:18:03.780 --> 3:18:11.460]  libertarian he's on a power trip what a sniveling rat and his bp is even worse than a lifelong
[3:18:11.460 --> 3:18:16.580]  friend of hillary clinton a complete neocon so he's he's a complete insider now and yet there's
[3:18:16.580 --> 3:18:21.060]  still a lot of butthurt libertarians that are going to be offended now i think the new definition
[3:18:21.060 --> 3:18:26.500]  the new definition of benedict Arnold is gary johnson he was always just posing as a libertarian
[3:18:26.500 --> 3:18:34.020]  to get cred as a little sleeper cell and uh now here he is and it's worked on a personal level
[3:18:34.020 --> 3:18:39.460]  for him because he's you know he's increased his support by about you know from what two percent
[3:18:39.460 --> 3:18:43.620]  to seven eight nine percent so it's worked personally for him because he's not gonna win
[3:18:43.620 --> 3:18:48.900]  but he's gonna take enough votes away from trump and he's a complete phony he's a total operative
[3:18:48.900 --> 3:18:54.020]  he was ordered here he did not like to be here the last time he was here and i told i told the
[3:18:54.020 --> 3:18:58.100]  nico i said i don't ever want to see that guy's face again and i'm the one that said set him up
[3:18:58.100 --> 3:19:02.580]  when he asked to come on and again he's just i never tell stories about how weird somebody is
[3:19:02.580 --> 3:19:06.900]  except for david duke during the breaks we had him on skype when we look at him on a big tv and he
[3:19:06.900 --> 3:19:11.140]  would look like he'd be all oh hi on air and then like during the break it was like a robot or
[3:19:11.140 --> 3:19:15.700]  something i was like man that's creepy but i'm telling you gary johnson is creepier than david
[3:19:15.700 --> 3:19:21.780]  duke i mean the creepometer is like pegging like hey go ahead and take over skip this break watch
[3:19:21.780 --> 3:19:26.820]  this i cut it on your time why not just skip everything uh paul was in from uh i guess you're
[3:19:26.820 --> 3:19:32.420]  in france this time james bond that's right yeah the islamic caliphate of friends you get
[3:19:32.420 --> 3:19:35.300]  somewhere where they have better internet connections go ahead and take over watching
[3:19:37.140 --> 3:19:42.420]  well the video on gary johnson is coming up in the second long segment but we're gonna get to that
[3:19:42.420 --> 3:19:47.780]  and you know as alex was saying normally i don't provaricate on people's behavior but i include
[3:19:47.780 --> 3:19:54.660]  some of that in this video because his mannerisms are just absolutely bizarre i mean you talk about
[3:19:54.660 --> 3:20:00.660]  hillary having her seizures gary johnson is almost on the same level but that's a side issue the main
[3:20:00.660 --> 3:20:08.180]  point is he's a complete phony he can go down the list tpp okay you're a libertarian gary johnson
[3:20:08.180 --> 3:20:14.900]  you're supposed to support small government tpp is global government on steroids it has nothing
[3:20:14.900 --> 3:20:20.260]  whatsoever to do with small government you talk about a carbon tax he wants to create a carbon
[3:20:20.260 --> 3:20:28.020]  tax he wants to give the the government the power of a massive tax bureaucracy enforced by this
[3:20:28.020 --> 3:20:34.020]  centralized gigantic system of oppression and control doesn't sound very libertarian to me
[3:20:34.740 --> 3:20:39.380]  you know he's thrown his support behind black lives matter because he's a proto social justice
[3:20:39.380 --> 3:20:47.620]  warrior a group whose platform openly brazenly espouses marxism the exact opposite of libertarian
[3:20:47.620 --> 3:20:53.620]  ism you know they talk about the government owning your children the community owning your children
[3:20:53.620 --> 3:20:59.860]  that doesn't sound very individualistic very libertarian to me so we're going to get on to
[3:20:59.860 --> 3:21:04.260]  the gary johnson video in the second long segment we're going back to hillary's health
[3:21:04.260 --> 3:21:11.060]  again this is an article out of the washington post mention this briefly now for years media
[3:21:11.060 --> 3:21:17.380]  matters and these admitted white house front groups that meet with president obama on a weekly
[3:21:17.380 --> 3:21:24.500]  basis they would put out articles whining being butthurt about who matt drudge linked to but
[3:21:24.500 --> 3:21:29.220]  i've never really seen it in the washington post here it is can we just stop talking about hillary
[3:21:29.220 --> 3:21:35.620]  clinton's health now this is chris kill is that the washington post today basically starts whining
[3:21:35.620 --> 3:21:42.260]  about the fact that drudge has linked to a lot of headlines about hillary clinton's double coughing
[3:21:42.260 --> 3:21:51.540]  fit yesterday double now bearing in mind we already had a media cover up within minutes of this
[3:21:51.540 --> 3:21:56.260]  taking place which we're going to get on to in a second of them claiming that it was pollen that
[3:21:56.260 --> 3:22:02.420]  it was allergens that caused this when pollen and allergens in the region were low and we prove that
[3:22:02.420 --> 3:22:10.100]  and outright brazen media lie to try and cover this up well now the washington post is extremely
[3:22:10.100 --> 3:22:16.980]  offended extremely triggered by the fact that anyone's talking about it at all the article says this
[3:22:16.980 --> 3:22:21.540]  is not new led by drudge there have been questions circulating in the conservative media and among
[3:22:21.540 --> 3:22:27.540]  trump surrogates like rudy juliani that something is wrong with clinton for months much of that
[3:22:27.540 --> 3:22:32.900]  speculation ties back to an episode in late 2012 in which clinton caught a stomach virus
[3:22:32.900 --> 3:22:37.620]  felsa for the concussion and was then hops hospitalized due to a blood clot and of course
[3:22:37.620 --> 3:22:43.140]  much more went on than they admitted to that given all the medications she's supposedly on
[3:22:44.340 --> 3:22:49.940]  so then they go on to talk about the fact that now trumps becoming involved trump tweeted out today
[3:22:49.940 --> 3:22:54.020]  mainstream media never covered hillary's massive hacking or coughing attack yet it's number one
[3:22:54.020 --> 3:23:01.380]  trending what's up the article continues here's the thing this is a totally ridiculous issue
[3:23:01.380 --> 3:23:06.740]  for lots of reasons a one that if trump or his republican surrogates continues focus on is a
[3:23:06.740 --> 3:23:12.900]  surefire loser in the fall yes a surefire loser that's why hillary clinton has lost her lead over
[3:23:12.900 --> 3:23:18.580]  trump coincidentally over the past four weeks when this issue rose to the fore after my video
[3:23:18.580 --> 3:23:26.020]  got over four million views but again that's just a coincidence let's start here clinton has released
[3:23:26.020 --> 3:23:33.060]  the detailed letter from her personal position attesting to her overall good health well her
[3:23:33.060 --> 3:23:40.020]  own internist her own personal position says that hillary clinton is fine and that's all you need
[3:23:40.020 --> 3:23:46.740]  to know again this is why nobody trusts the mainstream media they think that that is investigative
[3:23:46.740 --> 3:23:53.460]  journalism to say hillary clinton's personal position says she's fine therefore it must be true
[3:23:53.460 --> 3:23:58.820]  no further inquiries necessary despite the fact that her private emails over and over again
[3:23:59.540 --> 3:24:04.660]  reveal that she's interested in all the this bizarre cocktail of medications you had dr
[3:24:04.660 --> 3:24:09.380]  drew come out and say that she was basically receiving treatment that wouldn't have looked
[3:24:09.380 --> 3:24:17.140]  out of place in the 1960s you've had other prominent doctors medical experts neurologists
[3:24:17.140 --> 3:24:22.820]  say exactly the same thing but they don't mention any of those people in this article
[3:24:22.820 --> 3:24:27.700]  they don't mention the 10 prominent doctors which is another article linked up on drudge
[3:24:28.260 --> 3:24:34.340]  that have publicly questioned hillary's health they don't mention a single one in fact remember
[3:24:34.340 --> 3:24:41.300]  the media when this first surfaced a few weeks ago brought out that fake medical document which we
[3:24:41.300 --> 3:24:46.900]  all knew was fake and none of us who are at the forefront of this issue ever cited it as proof
[3:24:46.900 --> 3:24:52.420]  but they used that as a straw man to say oh look at this fake document this is supposedly
[3:24:52.420 --> 3:24:59.220]  proof that hillary clinton is unwell this has been debunked well none of us ever cited that
[3:24:59.220 --> 3:25:06.340]  document as proof these are the lame tactics the media uses to try and assert to try and claim to
[3:25:06.340 --> 3:25:12.100]  try and dictate reality that this whole story has been debunked when it hasn't and citing hillary
[3:25:12.100 --> 3:25:19.860]  clinton's personal position as proof is not objective independent evidence when you have
[3:25:20.420 --> 3:25:27.140]  probably now 10 to a dozen health professionals top doctors coming out and making the same
[3:25:27.140 --> 3:25:33.300]  comments that we've been making for the past five weeks okay you can't just say hillary's
[3:25:33.300 --> 3:25:38.900]  personal physician say she's fine and claim that's evidence that the issue's being debunked that's
[3:25:38.900 --> 3:25:45.220]  not objective and in fact you've had numerous commentators come out and say just release the
[3:25:45.220 --> 3:25:53.060]  full medical records both trump and hillary clinton tell us what medication she's on as of right now
[3:25:53.060 --> 3:25:59.060]  they say oh you're trying to web md all her symptoms no i don't know what's wrong with
[3:25:59.060 --> 3:26:04.420]  her i'm not a doctor but i know a cover-up when i see it and this is what we see today in the
[3:26:04.420 --> 3:26:11.060]  washington post so they cite the letter from hillary clinton's personal physician as proof
[3:26:11.060 --> 3:26:17.220]  that she's well and then they claim that a similar letter from donald trump's doctor is
[3:26:17.220 --> 3:26:23.700]  completely worthless so again it's good enough for hillary but in the same situation not good
[3:26:23.700 --> 3:26:30.260]  enough for trump again the article continues the simple fact is that there is zero evidence that
[3:26:30.260 --> 3:26:35.780]  anything is seriously wrong with clinton if suffering an occasional coughing fit yeah like
[3:26:35.780 --> 3:26:41.060]  a dozen over the past year is evidence of a major health problem then 75 percent of the
[3:26:41.060 --> 3:26:47.780]  country must have that mystery illness and i am one of them okay who suffers prolonged
[3:26:47.780 --> 3:26:55.540]  coughing fits that go on for five minutes on a routine basis two in the same day who suffers
[3:26:55.540 --> 3:27:01.460]  that and calls it normal if you were coughing for five minutes on a routine basis would you be
[3:27:01.460 --> 3:27:07.460]  concerned about your health again you don't see donald trump having five minute coughing fits
[3:27:07.460 --> 3:27:13.620]  where he has to eat lozenges and drink water looking completely embarrassed in front of an
[3:27:13.620 --> 3:27:21.060]  audience when have you seen that never never yet he does far more speeches far more press
[3:27:21.060 --> 3:27:28.660]  conferences than sick hillary clinton so for the washington post to claim that that behavior
[3:27:28.660 --> 3:27:38.900]  is normal completely asinine manifestly provably not normal in any situation hasn't happened to
[3:27:38.900 --> 3:27:46.420]  donald trump hasn't happened to any other politician in recent history it's not normal
[3:27:47.220 --> 3:27:54.500]  so again they don't even mention the top medical experts the neurologists that we featured
[3:27:54.500 --> 3:28:02.660]  in article after article after article not a single one again they're focusing on what
[3:28:02.660 --> 3:28:09.300]  drudge is linking to he's linking to a story entitled ten doctors question hillary health
[3:28:10.820 --> 3:28:15.940]  but they don't talk about that in the article they talk about hillary's personal position
[3:28:15.940 --> 3:28:22.740]  writing a note saying she's fine and that's the end of the argument again completely pathetic
[3:28:22.740 --> 3:28:31.220]  this is why 94 percent of americans don't trust the mainstream media because they lie they cover
[3:28:32.100 --> 3:28:35.060]  they create straw men's over and over again
[3:28:37.700 --> 3:28:41.860]  now in relation to that we had this article of again this is up on the drudge report and the
[3:28:41.860 --> 3:28:47.460]  washington post is not happy about the fact that it's linked up there media caught in blatant lie
[3:28:47.460 --> 3:28:54.660]  to cover for hillary's coughing fit the mainstream media attempted to dismiss questions over hillary
[3:28:54.660 --> 3:28:59.780]  clinton's health after a latest round of coughing fits by claiming that pollen counts in the area
[3:28:59.780 --> 3:29:08.340]  were high when in reality they were low that's right they outright fabricated pollen counts
[3:29:08.980 --> 3:29:15.540]  to try and blame hillary's coughing fit on that this was msm bc i posted the tweet yesterday
[3:29:15.540 --> 3:29:22.980]  they reported quote allergens were high in northeast ohio on monday before asserting there is no
[3:29:22.980 --> 3:29:29.060]  evidence to indicate that hillary clinton is unwell again you go on the weather reports which
[3:29:29.060 --> 3:29:36.740]  are featured in this article they show grass pollen tree pollen ragweed pollen low low moderate
[3:29:37.620 --> 3:29:43.060]  in none of those cases where pollen counts high yet the mainstream media lied about it
[3:29:43.060 --> 3:29:47.700]  they fabricated the story to try and make these questions go away we'll be back with the alex
[3:29:47.700 --> 3:29:54.980]  jones show live from the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[3:29:59.140 --> 3:30:03.380]  jovic's here with info wars dot com with an update on unhealthy hillary hillary clinton
[3:30:03.380 --> 3:30:10.660]  says conspiracy theories about her health not a concern sorry but it is not a conspiracy you

[3:30:23.060 --> 3:30:28.260]  you very rarely speak for over 15 minutes this is not a conspiracy there's something going on
[3:30:28.260 --> 3:30:32.100]  article up at yahoo news hillary clinton the democratic party's presidential nominee on
[3:30:32.100 --> 3:30:36.260]  monday said that she was not distracted by rumors of ill health and that attacks on the
[3:30:36.260 --> 3:30:41.460]  clinton foundation were not rooted in fact yes they are clinton speaking on her campaign plane
[3:30:41.460 --> 3:30:47.700]  also said she continued to support a no-fly zone over syria guess what you're a no-fly zone because
[3:30:47.700 --> 3:30:52.740]  you're a bad person no one should be around you you should be in a jail cell because you

[3:35:01.620 --> 3:35:09.060]  to challenge the lamestream media directly the same lamestream media that gets on a plane with
[3:35:09.060 --> 3:35:16.020]  hillary clinton has the chance to actually ask her a real question for the first time in months
[3:35:16.020 --> 3:35:24.260]  and what did they ask her how was your weekend absolutely pathetic look at their faces in the
[3:35:24.260 --> 3:35:33.060]  photo that we posted this is the esteemed mainstream media with 6 trust amongst americans
[3:35:33.060 --> 3:35:38.980]  right now take a look at that photo do they look inquisitive do they look like they're about to ask
[3:35:38.980 --> 3:35:45.220]  the hard questions to get to the core of the real issues that the american people want to hear about
[3:35:45.220 --> 3:35:53.460]  no they look like enraptured tween taylor swift fans about to meet their idol for the first time
[3:35:53.460 --> 3:36:01.220]  this is the castrated pathetic corporate media and then they have the temerity to whine about
[3:36:01.220 --> 3:36:07.780]  bright bar about the drudge report about info wars dot com about how much we've grown well when
[3:36:07.780 --> 3:36:14.260]  that's the competition obviously we're going to grow absolutely pathetic so they were caught in
[3:36:14.260 --> 3:36:21.620]  another lie claimed that hillary was coughing because allergens in the area were very high
[3:36:21.620 --> 3:36:30.580]  in northeast ohio absolute bs we went through the weather reports every single pollen count was low
[3:36:30.580 --> 3:36:36.980]  the highest one was moderate most of them were low they invented this story out of whole cloth
[3:36:37.860 --> 3:36:43.620]  calling people who question hillary's health sexist didn't work we pointed out that the media was
[3:36:43.620 --> 3:36:49.220]  obsessed about john mccain's health back in 2008 then they tried to claim it was a huge conspiracy
[3:36:49.220 --> 3:36:56.100]  theory invented by the right wing conspiracy conspiracy machine once again that failed when
[3:36:56.100 --> 3:37:02.020]  you had prominent doctors come out and make the same point even though they never mentioned them
[3:37:02.020 --> 3:37:09.140]  in the article now they're just resorting to inventing crap out of thin air it's absolutely
[3:37:09.140 --> 3:37:15.220]  bizarre while claiming that this is doing nothing whatsoever to harm hillary clinton's
[3:37:15.220 --> 3:37:22.260]  electability while she's lost her lead over donald trump just coincidentally since this issue came to
[3:37:22.260 --> 3:37:30.100]  the fore again in her ridiculous alt right speech hillary clinton invoking this health issue once
[3:37:30.100 --> 3:37:36.980]  again while pandering her own bizarre conspiracy theory is about vladimir putin being in control
[3:37:36.980 --> 3:37:43.220]  of everything but we're going to get back into that after this first i want to go to the video
[3:37:43.220 --> 3:37:50.660]  that went up on info wars.com just a few hours ago and this is talking about gary johnson of
[3:37:50.660 --> 3:37:55.620]  course the libertarian party candidate for president why are we talking about gary johnson
[3:37:55.620 --> 3:38:02.020]  when he has absolutely no chance whatsoever of winning the presidency well in places like
[3:38:02.020 --> 3:38:09.380]  arizona he could take away enough votes from donald trump to have a very real effect on the
[3:38:09.380 --> 3:38:15.300]  outcome of the presidential election this is why it's important this is out of the chicago
[3:38:15.300 --> 3:38:20.820]  tribune in arizona gary johnson could play spoiler in presidential elections well isn't that
[3:38:20.820 --> 3:38:27.460]  interesting i had a bunch of libertarians on my facebook page claim that johnson is only going
[3:38:27.460 --> 3:38:33.380]  to take away votes from hillary clinton so why am i even making this point well that's completely
[3:38:33.380 --> 3:38:39.700]  wrong from the article if hillary clinton carries arizona in november there's a good chance it won't
[3:38:39.700 --> 3:38:44.660]  be because democrats on their own have flipped a reliable geop state they hope to win consistently
[3:38:44.660 --> 3:38:52.980]  someday instead clinton and democrats may have gary johnson to thank the libertarian party nominees
[3:38:52.980 --> 3:38:57.460]  best chance to influence the presidential race may come in arizona where the former new mexico
[3:38:57.460 --> 3:39:04.100]  governor appeals to a group of finicky conservatives who make up part of the geop base it could happen
[3:39:04.100 --> 3:39:08.580]  said geop senator jeff flake donald trump has managed to make this an interesting state in
[3:39:08.580 --> 3:39:14.980]  terms of presidential politics and not in the way republicans have wanted johnson is an easy
[3:39:14.980 --> 3:39:22.020]  out for some people in our party flake told the associated press so there you go he's going to
[3:39:22.020 --> 3:39:28.580]  take away votes from donald trump in key battleground states again that's going to cost him the
[3:39:28.580 --> 3:39:35.700]  election up against hillary clinton that's why talking about gary johnson right at this moment
[3:39:35.700 --> 3:39:42.980]  after all these ridiculous faux pas he's been caught in is a very central core issue now here's
[3:39:42.980 --> 3:39:48.740]  the video it's up on youtube please share it please get it out to people gary johnson is a
[3:39:48.740 --> 3:39:54.980]  complete idiot let's play the clip with the polls tightening it looks like this presidential race
[3:39:54.980 --> 3:40:01.220]  could be really close although he has zero chance of winning libertarian candidate gary johnson could
[3:40:01.220 --> 3:40:08.340]  take enough votes away from trump in key states to ensure a hillary clinton victory now that wouldn't
[3:40:08.340 --> 3:40:15.540]  be an issue for me if johnson were a principled libertarian candidate but he isn't he's a total
[3:40:15.540 --> 3:40:22.820]  fraud and a complete idiot gary johnson the so-called small government libertarian wants to give the
[3:40:22.820 --> 3:40:30.340]  government the power to forcibly inject your children at gunpoint if necessary that's not
[3:40:30.340 --> 3:40:36.420]  libertarian you see there's something called a norm aggression principle gary don't know if you've
[3:40:36.420 --> 3:40:43.940]  heard of it yeah it's basically the bedrock of libertarian values might be worth googling during
[3:40:43.940 --> 3:40:51.620]  a recent cnbc interview johnson said he was open to supporting a carbon tax well i do think that
[3:40:51.620 --> 3:40:58.340]  climate change is occurring then it is man-caused one of the one of the proposals that i think is
[3:40:58.340 --> 3:41:06.020]  a very libertarian proposal and and i'm i'm just open to this is is a taxing carbon emission right
[3:41:06.020 --> 3:41:12.580]  so the so-called small government libertarian wants to implement a massive government taxing scheme
[3:41:12.580 --> 3:41:19.460]  enforced by a gigantic owner a centralized bureaucracy that's not libertarian the so-called
[3:41:19.460 --> 3:41:25.060]  small government libertarian wants to give the government the power to shut down bakeries that
[3:41:25.060 --> 3:41:32.980]  refuse to make gay wedding cakes violating his own libertarian party's platform that's not libertarian
[3:41:32.980 --> 3:41:38.340]  things to do as opposed to should have to bake the cake for the nazi wedding that's uh that would be
[3:41:38.340 --> 3:41:44.660]  my contention yes the so-called libertarian supports black lives matter a group whose public platform
[3:41:44.660 --> 3:41:54.260]  has all the specific hallmarks of marxism the exact opposite of libertarianism that's not libertarian
[3:41:54.260 --> 3:42:01.140]  johnson supports the tpp a globalist trade deal that even hillary clinton had to back away from
[3:42:01.140 --> 3:42:06.100]  would you withdraw from the tpp on your first day in office and unconditionally rule out its
[3:42:06.100 --> 3:42:12.900]  passage in any form i'm being told that the trans-specific partnership would in fact advance
[3:42:12.900 --> 3:42:21.140]  free trade and so i would support that document tpp is not just big government it's global government
[3:42:21.140 --> 3:42:27.700]  on steroids that's not libertarian he also wants to admit tens of thousands of muslim migrants
[3:42:27.700 --> 3:42:33.860]  into america because that worked out great for germany didn't it terror attacks virtually every
[3:42:33.860 --> 3:42:40.500]  week mass molestations of women rampant criminality sounds like a violation of the non-aggression
[3:42:40.500 --> 3:42:47.460]  principle to me and that's not libertarian as governor of new mexico johnson the so-called
[3:42:47.460 --> 3:42:57.540]  fiscal libertarian inherited a debt of 1.8 billion dollars and left a debt of 4.6 billion dollars
[3:42:57.540 --> 3:43:04.980]  that's not libertarian gary johnson isn't a libertarian he's a social justice warrior posing
[3:43:04.980 --> 3:43:12.500]  as a libertarian he's a phony he even gets triggered like an sjw when people use the term
[3:43:12.500 --> 3:43:18.180]  illegal immigrant millions of adult illegal immigrants who are here in the country i'm
[3:43:18.180 --> 3:43:24.820]  documented by the way if you use the term illegal immigrants that is very incendiary to our hispanic
[3:43:24.820 --> 3:43:30.420]  population here in this country why is that it just is it just is just so that you know
[3:43:30.420 --> 3:43:35.540]  just so that you know and you don't have to use that term but isn't the term accurate in the in
[3:43:35.540 --> 3:43:40.260]  the sense that they entered the country they immigrated to the country illegally so they are
[3:43:40.260 --> 3:43:47.140]  i'm not saying they came into this country because they couldn't get in legally and the jobs existed
[3:43:47.140 --> 3:43:52.980]  and you or i would have done the same thing and we're talking about now coming from new mexico a
[3:43:52.980 --> 3:44:00.980]  population with 48 hispanic how's the crackdown on 11 million undocumented workers going to work
[3:44:00.980 --> 3:44:05.940]  out it's going to be dragging people from their homes that's how it's going to work out it's going
[3:44:05.940 --> 3:44:11.940]  to be checking your papers house to house and i got to tell you what donald trump is saying
[3:44:11.940 --> 3:44:18.820]  regarding immigration could not be more incendiary it is insulting to me coming from new mexico
[3:44:18.820 --> 3:44:24.580]  isn't it though unfair to compare let's say everything that donald trump saying to simply
[3:44:24.580 --> 3:44:31.620]  using the term illegal immigrant i mean if i if i were undocumented it just is it just is
[3:44:31.620 --> 3:44:37.700]  just so that you know well just so that you know gary policing language and censoring words in the
[3:44:37.700 --> 3:44:44.580]  name of pandering to political correctness that's not libertarian he thinks calling someone a racist
[3:44:44.580 --> 3:44:52.580]  over and over again constitutes an argument newsflash gary it doesn't racist it's just racist he
[3:44:52.580 --> 3:45:02.180]  thinks crooked hillary is a wonderful public servant hillary clinton um hillary clinton um
[3:45:03.540 --> 3:45:11.380]  a wonderful public servant on what planet does that comment resonate with any libertarian i mean
[3:45:11.380 --> 3:45:18.340]  just look at the guy who makes expressions like this what the hell is wrong with him on a personal
[3:45:18.340 --> 3:45:25.460]  level gary johnson is also a complete after being presented with a replica of george washington's
[3:45:25.460 --> 3:45:33.140]  pistol by his tearful campaign rival johnson immediately tossed it in the trash what a
[3:45:34.180 --> 3:45:39.940]  johnson's running mate is bill weld a neocon who supported the invasion of iraq back to gun control
[3:45:39.940 --> 3:45:46.660]  measures endorsed barack obama and is a longtime personal friend of you guessed it hillary clinton
[3:45:46.660 --> 3:45:52.340]  and none of that is very libertarian there's never been a more unpopular set of major party
[3:45:52.340 --> 3:45:59.060]  candidates than ever before you'd think this would be the year above all others for the libertarian
[3:45:59.060 --> 3:46:06.980]  party to make a huge impression in promoting real libertarian values but no instead they've chosen
[3:46:06.980 --> 3:46:12.740]  to select a complete clown who permanently looks like he's about to break out into a childish
[3:46:12.740 --> 3:46:20.260]  temper tantrum a half-wit who wouldn't recognize a libertarian value if it violated the non-aggression
[3:46:20.260 --> 3:46:28.180]  principle and smacked him in the face gary johnson is not a libertarian he's a fraud and it doesn't
[3:46:28.180 --> 3:46:36.020]  matter whether you support trump or not if you vote for gary johnson you're an idiot racist it's
[3:46:36.020 --> 3:46:48.100]  just racist that video is on youtube and it's on info wars dot com gary johnson is a complete idiot
[3:46:48.660 --> 3:46:53.300]  please share that please get that out because i said it's very important to emphasize the fact
[3:46:53.300 --> 3:46:59.940]  that johnson could take away votes from trump in key battleground states like arizona even though
[3:46:59.940 --> 3:47:07.460]  he's completely abandoned all his so-called principles since 2012 he's vastly increased
[3:47:07.460 --> 3:47:13.380]  his support base since four years ago so he's going to have an instrumental effect an instrumental
[3:47:13.380 --> 3:47:20.500]  impact on this presidential election now if you had like a ron paul figure again running as a third
[3:47:20.500 --> 3:47:27.380]  party in this election pointing out that he was a real libertarian candidate had real consistent
[3:47:27.380 --> 3:47:32.820]  libertarian principles i would have absolutely no problem with that and i would probably support
[3:47:32.820 --> 3:47:39.940]  him over donald trump in fact i supported rand paul before i support a donald trump and in favor
[3:47:39.940 --> 3:47:45.940]  of donald trump so if you had a real genuine candidate an actual libertarian with real libertarian
[3:47:45.940 --> 3:47:51.380]  values who was consistent and stuck to them i would have absolutely no problem with that
[3:47:51.380 --> 3:48:00.820]  and would support it 100 but as he saw in the video you can go down the list tpp carbon taxes
[3:48:00.820 --> 3:48:09.620]  forced mandatory vaccinations debt support for fringe left-wing extremist violent groups like
[3:48:09.620 --> 3:48:17.220]  black lives matter all of these issues mass immigration policing language what kind of
[3:48:17.220 --> 3:48:23.620]  libertarian tries to police what words people can use for god's sake i mean what happened to the
[3:48:23.620 --> 3:48:30.340]  libertarian party we saw it in canada i mean they kicked out lauren sunday kicked her out of the
[3:48:30.340 --> 3:48:37.940]  party for retweeting one of my videos because they found it offensive where did this sjw strain
[3:48:37.940 --> 3:48:45.700]  come from it's infected the libertarian party and it's characterized by gary johnson a complete
[3:48:45.700 --> 3:48:52.900]  fraud a phony and the prime reason why i had to stop identifying as a libertarian
[3:48:53.700 --> 3:49:02.020]  because he's a terrible awful ambassador for that term and that's why nobody should vote for him
[3:49:02.020 --> 3:49:08.020]  don't vote for anybody if you really hate trump and hillary on an equal footing just don't vote
[3:49:08.020 --> 3:49:15.220]  for anybody because voting for gary johnson you're just betraying your own principles because he
[3:49:15.220 --> 3:49:22.260]  betrayed his a long time ago so get that video out again it's up on informals.com and youtube
[3:49:22.980 --> 3:49:29.620]  gary johnson is a complete idiot now moving back to some of the news stories here we've covered
[3:49:29.620 --> 3:49:36.500]  hillary's health earlier today in the uk we had a black lives matter protest now when i say the
[3:49:36.500 --> 3:49:44.580]  words black lives matter i actually mean six white middle class hipster trendies representing black
[3:49:44.580 --> 3:49:51.940]  people in their own words they basically got a dingy they sailed out onto onto the river temps
[3:49:51.940 --> 3:49:59.060]  snuck onto the tarmac at london city airport and basically caused huge delays they were messing
[3:49:59.060 --> 3:50:05.060]  around with aircraft basically giving isis ideas on how to attack a major airport well done there
[3:50:06.260 --> 3:50:12.740]  ultimate the point that air pollution is racist that's right that's your new racist thing for today
[3:50:12.740 --> 3:50:22.340]  is air pollution because this airport is located next to poor areas of london okay one of the biggest
[3:50:22.340 --> 3:50:30.260]  airports in the world is Heathrow airport that's located next to places like richmond q and brentford
[3:50:31.140 --> 3:50:38.500]  which are amongst the wealthiest whitest areas in the entire country so air pollution is racist
[3:50:38.500 --> 3:50:43.060]  is at london city airport because it's near poor areas where black people live
[3:50:44.420 --> 3:50:49.540]  and yet we have one of the biggest airports in the world he throw located in extremely white
[3:50:49.540 --> 3:50:55.540]  wealthy areas is that racist too absolutely ridiculous we'll be back with the final segment

[3:54:09.540 --> 3:54:16.580]  We are back for the final segment of the Alex Jones show some more things that are now officially
[3:54:16.580 --> 3:54:22.820]  racist in case you didn't know this is according to chief diversity officer at Clark University
[3:54:23.620 --> 3:54:31.700]  asking Asian people to help you with maths that's racist talking to black people about basketball
[3:54:31.700 --> 3:54:40.580]  that's now racist that's a microaggression and it's not allowed UMass says that Harambe memes
[3:54:40.580 --> 3:54:49.780]  are now officially racist now I saw I think it was UT Texas Longhorn fans in a video using this
[3:54:49.780 --> 3:54:54.820]  Harambe meme so I thought at that point well it's pretty much done it's pretty much dead
[3:54:54.820 --> 3:55:00.020]  those people aren't the sharpest knives in the drawer so I officially announced the death of
[3:55:00.020 --> 3:55:06.100]  the Harambe meme but now that UMass is saying that the Harambe meme is racist I think it's time to
[3:55:06.100 --> 3:55:12.500]  bring it back and again it's like when people get upset and offended about me using the word retard
[3:55:12.500 --> 3:55:20.340]  on Twitter now obviously when I use the word retard I'm not talking about disabled children
[3:55:20.340 --> 3:55:26.820]  and in fact it only reflects on them if they think that me using the word retard is an insult
[3:55:26.820 --> 3:55:33.780]  to children with Down syndrome that's in their head that's never in my head when I use words
[3:55:33.780 --> 3:55:40.340]  like retard so now the people again this is probably why hipster university types again
[3:55:40.900 --> 3:55:48.100]  the bigotry of low expectations thinking that black people can't handle a fun jokey internet
[3:55:48.100 --> 3:55:54.660]  meme about a dead gorilla saying that it's racist against black people and it's got nothing whatsoever
[3:55:54.660 --> 3:56:00.180]  to do with that again they're the racist for making that connection so again they're saying
[3:56:00.180 --> 3:56:06.180]  that you can't use the Harambe meme anymore that officially means it's resurrected hashtag
[3:56:06.180 --> 3:56:13.460]  justice for Harambe we need more Harambe memes let's get into some final news stories here
[3:56:14.420 --> 3:56:18.740]  again this is out of brightbot.com talking about the internet takeover
[3:56:18.740 --> 3:56:24.900]  Obama internet cannot be like Wild Wild West President Obama called for a series of international
[3:56:24.900 --> 3:56:29.060]  agreements to regulate activity on the internet citing his preference not to start an arms race
[3:56:29.060 --> 3:56:34.420]  in cyberspace what we cannot do is have a situation in which suddenly this becomes the Wild Wild West
[3:56:34.420 --> 3:56:39.700]  President Obama said during the press conference in China on Monday after the G after the G20 summit
[3:56:40.980 --> 3:56:48.340]  now you could take those words and substitute President Barack Obama to any third world dictator
[3:56:48.340 --> 3:56:55.700]  who has used the very same justification for shutting down the internet we saw in China
[3:56:55.700 --> 3:57:03.060]  ongoing for years every time they have civil unrest people protesting against the authorities
[3:57:03.060 --> 3:57:10.420]  against the police they come out and say for stability for safety for security we need to
[3:57:10.420 --> 3:57:18.020]  shut down the internet because it's becoming too wild even though that exact thing is what made
[3:57:18.020 --> 3:57:26.260]  the internet so great so free-flowing so dynamic in the first place so you've got Obama directly
[3:57:26.260 --> 3:57:31.860]  invoking the rhetoric of third world dictators when it comes to shutting down the internet
[3:57:32.740 --> 3:57:38.660]  saying that America faces cyber attacks but on the other hand then saying that quote we've got
[3:57:38.660 --> 3:57:45.060]  more capacity than anybody both offensively and defensively when it comes to cyber attacks so
[3:57:45.060 --> 3:57:49.940]  we need to shut down the internet because of cyber attacks but on the other hand we're the best at
[3:57:49.940 --> 3:57:56.980]  carrying out cyber attacks that's what Obama said today more cultural enrichment news this is out
[3:57:56.980 --> 3:58:02.820]  the Daily Mail six Afghan and Iraqi migrants are arrested eight women are sexually assaulted at
[3:58:02.820 --> 3:58:10.020]  Austrian festival again they lied about their age they claimed to be 15 so they wouldn't be deported
[3:58:10.020 --> 3:58:15.700]  this has happened over and over again as we said it would multiple times in sweden every single
[3:58:15.700 --> 3:58:23.300]  festival they have there's mass molestation of women this is a really bad situation Merkel's
[3:58:23.300 --> 3:58:28.500]  losing support and things are going to change otherwise there's going to be wider civil unrest
[3:58:28.500 --> 3:58:33.540]  throughout Europe that's going to wrap it up for this edition of the alex jones show stay
