[00:00.000 --> 00:22.840]  How many times must I tell you that we're going to speak to globalists together by exposing
[00:22.840 --> 00:28.680]  the fact that they're an unelected, worldwide, totalitarian, crony capitalist, organized
[00:28.680 --> 00:34.280]  crime system. You see it happening. They're in big trouble. They're saying we're going
[00:34.280 --> 00:40.360]  to politically destroy and financially destroy anybody that tries to lead a resistance against
[00:40.360 --> 00:44.400]  us. That way the elite just sit there in power. Everybody knows they're corrupt. Everybody
[00:44.400 --> 00:49.880]  knows they want us pouring dumb down. Everybody knows they're a bunch of eugenicists, but they'll
[00:49.880 --> 00:54.480]  destroy anybody that tries to resist them or any nation that tries to break free of
[00:54.480 --> 01:01.000]  their octopus hydra grip. But history shows no amount of propaganda, no amount of intimidation
[01:01.000 --> 01:07.040]  will work once the general population is awakened and culturally focused against it.
[01:07.040 --> 01:10.600]  Wow, there is so much, obviously, that I'm going to get to today and then David Knight's
[01:10.600 --> 01:16.040]  coming in. I'll be back most of the full show. Lord willing, this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. Of course,
[01:16.040 --> 01:21.480]  I'll be back in tomorrow, some as well, but I'm going through major trials and tribulations
[01:21.480 --> 01:27.080]  right now, as everyone knows, and they're only intensifying each week in the test.
[01:27.080 --> 01:30.560]  And the real test is I don't blame God for any of this. This is just the nature of the
[01:30.560 --> 01:36.080]  world, the nature of a fallen man, and also a lot of mistakes and things I've done. I'm
[01:36.080 --> 01:40.520]  far from perfect, but because I'm not here trying to sell people out or enslave humanity,
[01:40.520 --> 01:45.160]  I'm trying to empower humanity. I do love God. The enemy in the world absolutely hates
[01:45.160 --> 01:53.160]  me, just as the Bible tells us. Ivanka Trump goes to a UN Women's Summit in Berlin, obviously,
[01:53.160 --> 02:01.080]  yesterday, rubs elbows with Angela Merkel and breaks with her father because it's a women's
[02:01.080 --> 02:07.560]  rights issue. She says, bring in refugees. Isn't that funny? For the women, 80% according
[02:07.560 --> 02:16.680]  to Interpol of the migrants are military age men. Close to 90% are of the male gender.
[02:16.680 --> 02:22.360]  So we're talking 11% or so that are women and children, but they always show you the
[02:22.360 --> 02:28.800]  women and children in the shots. They find those shots so that you feel bad and you feel
[02:28.800 --> 02:35.640]  sorry and then you accept it. And then she can go on TV and say, we need to let them
[02:35.640 --> 02:44.680]  go. So truly, disgusting propaganda. And is it Trump playing good cop, bad cop? He has
[02:44.680 --> 02:48.400]  tried to stop the seven nations where they don't vet anybody and they just give them
[02:48.400 --> 02:54.920]  fake passports like Somalia, Sudan and others. But now she's challenging the president, her
[02:54.920 --> 03:02.440]  own father to change his policies. This is just ridiculous. We did not elect Ivanka Trump.
[03:02.440 --> 03:07.920]  We did not elect her Democratic Party husband, Jared Kushner. Oh, remember about two and
[03:07.920 --> 03:14.760]  a half, three weeks ago, we had Steve Pachenecan saying it was going to break soon in the news
[03:14.760 --> 03:19.960]  that Jared Kushner has been compromised by Communist China. And guess what was in the
[03:19.960 --> 03:30.040]  New York Times yesterday? Oh, fake news scoops you again. No, we're the real news.
[03:30.040 --> 03:35.920]  Bribe case is a Jared Kushner partner and potential conflicts with Communist China and
[03:35.920 --> 03:42.920]  so much more. Isn't that just special? So there you go. That's why they hate us so much
[03:42.920 --> 03:47.440]  because we can force this information on the open and it's come out now on the Daily Caller.
[03:47.440 --> 03:53.440]  It's up on infowars.com that Stephen Bannon called Jared Kushner a cuck and a globalist
[03:53.440 --> 03:58.680]  behind his back. Well, he certainly is a cuck for the establishment and everything he touches
[03:58.680 --> 04:04.400]  goes bankrupt. He's a good looking guy. We never heard him talk. I mean, you want to
[04:04.400 --> 04:11.280]  be in a man's game, Sonny, need to hear you talk a little bit. We hear your wife out there
[04:11.280 --> 04:15.320]  quite a bit and what comes out of her mouth doesn't sound too good. What came out of
[04:15.320 --> 04:19.800]  her mouth sounded real good at the RNC. Now that said, we're 100 days now into the Trump
[04:19.800 --> 04:27.920]  administration and it's a love hate relationship personally. It's paradoxical. Just so good
[04:27.920 --> 04:33.080]  on the economy, so good on sovereignty, so good on TPP, so good on bringing jobs back,
[04:33.080 --> 04:39.280]  so good on moving for the border wall, moving to kill Naftan Gatt. But more and more who
[04:39.280 --> 04:45.080]  he's bringing in, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, like this big bad one when we come back.
[04:45.080 --> 04:50.400]  Their level in their crosshairs for sure on whistleblowers, Julian Assange, Snowden and
[04:50.400 --> 04:55.760]  others calling them foreign intelligence operatives. So you might as well have John McCain run
[04:55.760 --> 05:02.000]  in the White House with that type of baloney. Stay with us.
[05:02.000 --> 05:06.800]  Trump just signed an executive order to pull the federal government out of K-12 education
[05:06.800 --> 05:11.520]  following through on a campaign promise to return school control to state and local officials.
[05:11.520 --> 05:16.160]  Titled Education Federalism Executive Order, it directs Education Secretary Betsy DeVos
[05:16.160 --> 05:21.360]  to launch a 300-day review of Obama-era regulations and guidance for school districts and gives
[05:21.360 --> 05:26.040]  her the power to modify or repeal measures she deems and overreach by the federal government.
[05:26.040 --> 05:30.600]  It was amazing to hear liberals scream and cry as Betsy DeVos was being confirmed. And
[05:30.600 --> 05:35.200]  all I was saying the entire time was, good, we need to get rid of the Department of Education.
[05:35.200 --> 05:38.720]  You wonder why your local schools don't have money to pay teachers or for upkeep? It's
[05:38.720 --> 05:43.160]  because that money is being held by the federal government. Don't believe me, just read the
[05:43.160 --> 05:47.000]  book The Deliberate Dumbing Down of America by Charlotte Isherby. She was a whistleblower
[05:47.000 --> 05:51.800]  from the Department of Education in the 1980s. And her tone describes how the federal education
[05:51.800 --> 05:57.440]  system was designed to create automatons. Rob Dew reporting for Infowars.com and Infowars
[05:57.440 --> 06:21.040]  Nightly News.
[06:21.040 --> 06:27.840]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula. It's loaded with good halogen iodine,
[06:27.840 --> 06:31.320]  said the bad halogen fluoride. Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used

[07:02.200 --> 07:06.080]  The reason Infowars Life has five star ratings on major third party sites is because I want
[07:06.080 --> 07:09.760]  products I'm going to use for my family. I take this. My family takes this and then
[07:09.760 --> 07:13.600]  it funds the operation, but the most hardcore, truthful information you're going to find
[07:13.600 --> 07:17.360]  anywhere. So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at
[07:17.360 --> 07:18.360]  InfowarsLife.com.
[07:18.360 --> 07:24.320]  If I ever forget to take them, like I'm having noticeable difference. I don't feel good. The
[07:24.320 --> 07:27.880]  nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life changing for me.
[07:27.880 --> 07:32.880]  Yeah, I've actually have just run out of my Super Female. I had a few bottles at my house
[07:32.880 --> 07:38.280]  and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again. Very exciting, feeling great,
[07:38.280 --> 07:44.360]  looking good. And I know my hair is luxurious once again. So obviously the Super Female
[07:44.360 --> 07:46.080]  is amazing. I love it.
[07:46.080 --> 07:50.960]  Nascent iodine is essential. Survival Shield X2. If there's one product that I would say
[07:50.960 --> 07:55.840]  is life changing, that I would suggest it's nascent iodine Survival Shield X2. It's got
[07:55.840 --> 08:16.440]  a five star rating. It's a win-win. InfowarsLife.com.
[08:16.440 --> 08:25.440]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones. Outta my way. Outta my day.
[08:25.440 --> 08:34.320]  Outta my way, Satan. Get behind me. I'm not strong, but God's strong. When I come into
[08:34.320 --> 08:38.680]  the presence of God, when I got on my knees this morning for about 15 minutes, I can just
[08:38.680 --> 08:46.800]  feel how fallen I was and my separation from God. And then I can feel God come closer and
[08:46.800 --> 08:52.120]  I can feel the spirit rise in me. And quite frankly, it makes you be ashamed of yourself,
[08:52.120 --> 08:56.800]  but you are so close to God, you just know how real it is and how you want to be purified
[08:56.800 --> 08:57.800]  and sanctified.
[08:57.800 --> 09:02.160]  You know, the Holy Spirit comes on me when I'm never expecting it and it's so strong,
[09:02.160 --> 09:07.680]  but whenever you purposely get on your knees and pray at a set time, it's good to do because
[09:07.680 --> 09:11.840]  you realize how worldly you are and how you were in the world and how you were so much
[09:11.840 --> 09:18.000]  more fallen like someone down deep in black water. But as you begin to swim up towards
[09:18.000 --> 09:24.120]  the surface, you break out and then there's the sun. You're not like God, you're not pure
[09:24.120 --> 09:28.320]  like God, you're not holy like God, but now you're in the atmosphere of God and you can
[09:28.320 --> 09:39.960]  see the edge, the light, the archetype of God. It's an amazing time to be alive. Evil
[09:39.960 --> 09:47.280]  is rising because liberty is rising. The great test, the trials and tribulations that we're
[09:47.280 --> 09:53.920]  always facing, are now going to intensify because the energetic level of the planet
[09:53.920 --> 10:00.080]  is rising and the enemy is moving against humanity on every front, but God is working
[10:00.080 --> 10:06.400]  through you and so many others in the face of this flood of corruption. And forget the
[10:06.400 --> 10:10.280]  exact area of the Bible, maybe we can search into it, but when the enemy comes in like
[10:10.280 --> 10:15.000]  a flood, the spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard against it. Everything is part
[10:15.000 --> 10:20.600]  of God's plan. The Lord works some mysterious ways. And you see the enemy taking everything,
[10:20.600 --> 10:28.920]  we say out of context, twisting it, turning the fact that I'm truthful against me, using
[10:28.920 --> 10:35.240]  their worldly systems for control. But then you have to really pity people like that.
[10:35.240 --> 10:40.120]  Isaiah, so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the west, and his glory from the
[10:40.120 --> 10:45.160]  rising of the sun, when the enemy shall come in like a flood, the spirit of the Lord shall
[10:45.160 --> 10:49.720]  lift up a standard against them. All right, let me just hit some of the basics that's
[10:49.720 --> 10:54.960]  coming up today. David Knight's going to be here. And then I get to go enjoy my trials
[10:54.960 --> 11:00.720]  and tribulations and my family's trials and tribulations. And then I should be back Sunday,
[11:00.720 --> 11:04.360]  maybe even tomorrow here in studio. We'll see you later, gentlemen. But Paul Watson's
[11:04.360 --> 11:08.460]  hosting his final show tomorrow, and he's going to go visit the Rockies for a few days
[11:08.460 --> 11:12.360]  with his girlfriend. And then they'll go back to London. Paul's doing a great job. It's
[11:12.360 --> 11:16.760]  been great having him and the rest of the crew here together. It's wonderful. True blessing,
[11:16.760 --> 11:21.080]  you know, the folks at work here getting to be associated with such a great, hardworking,
[11:21.080 --> 11:24.320]  focused, dedicated people. It's night and day in this office compared to out there on
[11:24.320 --> 11:27.160]  the street. There's a lot of great people on the street as well. It's just getting
[11:27.160 --> 11:31.640]  forward. There's such a concentration of hardworking, dedicated people. We get angry at the globalist
[11:31.640 --> 11:35.840]  sometimes and kind of wears off on each other. But we've got to just always remember that
[11:35.840 --> 11:39.640]  we're focused. We're moving forward, and we're going to keep the bullets going politically
[11:39.640 --> 11:40.640]  downfield.
[11:40.640 --> 11:47.960]  Let me hit this first. We started hearing rumblings the last month that the new CIA
[11:47.960 --> 11:53.040]  director and the new attorney general were going to make their big focus leaks. Now,
[11:53.040 --> 11:57.120]  the president has said leaks in the White House, leaks in Congress, leaks in the intelligence
[11:57.120 --> 12:03.800]  agencies, people leaking on his meetings every day. Oh, Jared Kushner is not going to get
[12:03.800 --> 12:07.640]  in trouble. We've confirmed, we've got the copies of the text messages. Oh yeah, we've
[12:07.640 --> 12:12.680]  got them all. That's why they didn't deny it when it all came out a few weeks ago with
[12:12.680 --> 12:15.280]  Roger Stone.
[12:15.280 --> 12:19.280]  Mr. Fake News is not Mr. Fake News. The media immediately went, oh my God, it's true. And
[12:19.280 --> 12:27.880]  then you saw all the backpedaling where Kushner and others are leaking like a sieve. Bannon
[12:27.880 --> 12:32.480]  will not even talk to anybody, including Breitbart, because he won't be accused of
[12:32.480 --> 12:38.880]  leaking. So he won't even talk to people. He's completely isolated because he's doing
[12:38.880 --> 12:40.600]  what Trump says.
[12:40.600 --> 12:47.120]  So imagine with the pedophile rings getting rounded up and the borders getting secured
[12:47.120 --> 12:50.960]  and the first hundred days, a lot of good economic things that are happening, a lot
[12:50.960 --> 12:54.880]  of amazing things like TPP getting killed. Trump is an American president. He is actually
[12:54.880 --> 12:59.680]  acting as president, doing some things I don't like doing a lot of things I love, but he's
[12:59.680 --> 13:04.440]  being the president. So that's the big positive. And there's a lot of great positive things
[13:04.440 --> 13:08.200]  about first hundred days that take hours to go over. Most of you can probably think of
[13:08.200 --> 13:09.200]  more than I can.
[13:09.200 --> 13:16.120]  But look at these headlines. Now this is bad. If they were prosecuting the leakers in the
[13:16.120 --> 13:23.920]  government with the hack that happened a few years ago, with the OPM hack, where you've
[13:23.920 --> 13:28.800]  had 14 to 20 million names of secret agents and government people and their social security
[13:28.800 --> 13:35.520]  numbers and their phone numbers and their associates and their connections all leaked.
[13:35.520 --> 13:41.600]  Nobody got in trouble. Nobody lost their job. Biggest devastating blow to our security and
[13:41.600 --> 13:49.200]  our history probably. And there's been so many other big events like that. Inside the
[13:49.200 --> 13:55.440]  cyber attack that shocked the US government. Well, nothing ever happened. Here we are like
[13:55.440 --> 14:00.080]  three years later, two and a half years later. So you've got all this leaking of sellouts
[14:00.080 --> 14:07.600]  to the communist China, the Clintons in bed with the Russians and Chinese up their eyeballs.
[14:07.600 --> 14:14.960]  And then Snowden and Assange that have exposed targeted corruption that whistleblowers have
[14:14.960 --> 14:19.320]  put out that needs to be exposed, that's criminal activity against the American people, the
[14:19.320 --> 14:23.840]  DNC rigging the election, trying to steal it, rigging the questions, all the things they
[14:23.840 --> 14:28.880]  said, let's keep America poor, let's keep them in the dark, all those incredible revelations
[14:28.880 --> 14:34.320]  of just how bona fide evil they are.
[14:34.320 --> 14:39.040]  And now the Democratic Party is running the entire MSM every day, running Google, banning
[14:39.040 --> 14:45.200]  libertarian patriot news, all of it proof. Huge victories we had, none of that's even
[14:45.200 --> 14:50.920]  in the news. And all we hear from Trump is stop these leaks and go, oh, yes, sir, we
[14:50.920 --> 14:57.640]  still, well, sir, you said, stop the leaks. And I know this isn't Trump. This is him delegating.
[14:57.640 --> 15:02.000]  I can barely run an office here with 60 something crew members. They're great people. You get
[15:02.000 --> 15:05.480]  a few traders in there, a few moles. We've had a couple moles in here over the years
[15:05.480 --> 15:10.640]  and they almost ran the ship aground. They try. By the grace of God, we discovered them
[15:10.640 --> 15:15.040]  right as they were basically involved in the sabotage.
[15:15.040 --> 15:20.120]  And to imagine Trump with 4,000 people under him and all the other interlocking agencies
[15:20.120 --> 15:25.960]  and a million plus employees that plug into that, it is crazy.
[15:25.960 --> 15:31.560]  So you've got the Vault 7 stuff coming out, all the illegal hacking and everything that
[15:31.560 --> 15:37.920]  proves that Trump's being illegally spied on and being framed. So people in the US government
[15:37.920 --> 15:45.880]  are leaking the WikiLeaks. He was high level contractor, been the CIA, you name it, Snowden.
[15:45.880 --> 15:50.840]  All of that's happening to back up what Trump's saying, putting him in office, exposing the
[15:50.840 --> 15:55.960]  deep state. The deep state's trying to sabotage Trump. He said that himself. So has Spicer,
[15:55.960 --> 16:01.560]  Sean Spicer, the press secretary. They've all said, yes, we're battling deep state and
[16:01.560 --> 16:07.360]  here's all the intel proving that and trying to save the country. And now the CIA director
[16:07.360 --> 16:18.960]  says that WikiLeaks is a hostile intelligence service. Wow. Our own patriots are giving
[16:18.960 --> 16:24.040]  90% of the intel to WikiLeaks. That's admitted. And he says that CIA chief blast WikiLeaks
[16:24.040 --> 16:28.840]  once praised by Trump. That's USA Today. Candidate Trump. I love WikiLeaks. President
[16:28.840 --> 16:39.480]  Trump. Arrest Assange, Ron Paul. It's all up on infowars.com. So Trump always talks
[16:39.480 --> 16:44.080]  about how he's loyal and how he, you know, all the rest of this stuff. And these people
[16:44.080 --> 16:50.360]  want a total limb to do all this and they're being thrown to the wolves. You add the cherry
[16:50.360 --> 16:59.080]  on top of Ivanka Trump going to the women's conference with Merkel and say, we bring more
[16:59.080 --> 17:05.840]  refugees in. It's for the women when it's 80% military age men, 89% men, gender wise,
[17:05.840 --> 17:11.240]  11% women and it's giant rape gangs all over running people over with cars in every major
[17:11.240 --> 17:15.560]  country, multiple times a year, shooting people every week. They won't even call it terror.
[17:15.560 --> 17:19.880]  And then she sets up there and says, I disagree with my father. He needs to change his position.
[17:19.880 --> 17:27.680]  Wow, Ivanka, we didn't elect you, sweetheart. Is it intimidation? Is it because they're
[17:27.680 --> 17:31.000]  liberals? Is it because they want to go to the coolest trendy restaurants? I don't know,
[17:31.000 --> 17:35.240]  but it's betrayal after betrayal and it's a paradox because Trump's doing all this
[17:35.240 --> 17:39.480]  great stuff and I'm glad Hillary isn't in. And he is being the American president and
[17:39.480 --> 17:45.640]  the global is still hating. But what is his family thinking? And it's family taking advantage
[17:45.640 --> 17:49.440]  of Trump bare minimum, but it doesn't matter because even if he's a good guy or a bad guy
[17:49.440 --> 17:55.480]  or whatever it is, it's a dereliction of duty to let his daughter run around and countervail.
[17:55.480 --> 17:59.400]  Everything we've built are sovereignty, what we've done and decide with the UN and the
[17:59.400 --> 18:04.920]  globalists that are trying to destroy her father and this country. And then we told
[18:04.920 --> 18:08.800]  you two and a half weeks ago, what was it three weeks ago? We can put it on screen. We
[18:08.800 --> 18:14.280]  had former high level CIA, you name it. That's all classified regime change expert Dr. Steve
[18:14.280 --> 18:18.920]  Pachinic saying it's going to come out the cushers run by the communist Chinese as April
[18:18.920 --> 18:25.920]  10th. So three weeks ago, bribe case is a Jared Kushner partner in potential conflicts
[18:25.920 --> 18:30.560]  New York Times getting into all of that yesterday. So there we are giving you all that intel
[18:30.560 --> 18:36.940]  way ahead of it being mainstream news. So it's simply amazing. You know all paramounts
[18:36.940 --> 18:42.720]  new chief revives a China deal where they begin to take over a paramount. They're trying
[18:42.720 --> 18:48.800]  to buy up all six right now. Look at drugreport.com. Kim puts White House in crosshairs, threatens
[18:48.800 --> 18:54.280]  to blow it up. Just look at government worship. Just look at the cult of government worship
[18:54.280 --> 18:59.400]  and how Venezuela starving to death in Brazil has the natives shooting arrows. I want to
[18:59.400 --> 19:03.360]  play that when we come back shooting arrows. You know at the parliament building because
[19:03.360 --> 19:06.960]  they won't even let the natives into the parliament. It should be represented in their
[19:06.960 --> 19:15.080]  tribal lands and just all the craziness. What's going on? Historic tax cuts to put USA back
[19:15.080 --> 19:21.160]  to work. That's some good news. Trump is trying to fulfill that promise. Austrian press. All
[19:21.160 --> 19:26.200]  women must wear ed scarves to fight Islamophobia. See what I told you? They're going to make
[19:26.200 --> 19:32.280]  everyone submit to Islam to stop making them get mad at us. I've been saying that for five
[19:32.280 --> 19:38.040]  six years and now they're actually doing it. That's the plan. You go to the liberal women's
[19:38.040 --> 19:42.200]  marches funded by Soros. Half the women are wearing hijabs. It's like a little rebellious
[19:42.200 --> 19:49.640]  you know, cuckold thing they do. Wow. We're going to come back and get into where I see
[19:49.640 --> 19:54.440]  all this going for one more segment and then David Knight's coming in. We've got so much

[20:38.920 --> 20:44.360]  New York Times bestseller Big Agenda. David Horowitz's Big Agenda exposes Obama's government

[21:03.360 --> 21:08.000]  you about our research into what has been called the iodine conspiracy. I've told you about
[21:08.000 --> 21:12.840]  how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ and how
[21:12.840 --> 21:17.920]  the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad
[21:17.920 --> 21:22.880]  member of the halogen family, into the water. They took the good halogen and put the deadly
[21:22.880 --> 21:27.520]  halogen in. And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today,
[21:27.520 --> 21:33.920]  I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family. Now in 2016, even more information
[21:33.920 --> 21:39.040]  has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts
[21:39.040 --> 21:44.240]  are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine. You can pull these
[21:44.240 --> 21:48.240]  studies up for yourself. This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine
[21:48.240 --> 21:53.480]  is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen. Stock up on Survival Shield

[24:17.360 --> 24:28.160]  live from the front lines of the InfoWars. We are back ladies and gentlemen. David Knight
[24:28.160 --> 24:33.640]  is coming into the next segment. Got a bunch of cash lined up today. Why is Trump going
[24:33.640 --> 24:37.840]  sideways? David Knight might want to open the phones up and get people's take on this.
[24:37.840 --> 24:43.280]  What do you think? A lot of stories up on infowars.com. I just mentioned this when it
[24:43.280 --> 24:48.360]  ties in. The story from Breitbart. Austrian press. All women must wear headscarves to
[24:48.360 --> 24:54.560]  fight Islamophobia. The only thing more ridiculous than that was all the big Swedish Stockholm
[24:54.560 --> 24:58.680]  syndrome. Literal articles on Stockholm. Articles a few weeks ago where the guy ran over a bunch
[24:58.680 --> 25:04.240]  of people with a car and killed him. They said ban cars so that we can't be run over.
[25:04.240 --> 25:07.680]  They didn't even say it was a Muslim. Didn't even say he screamed Allah Akbar even though
[25:07.680 --> 25:17.080]  he did. Wouldn't let you see the images of it. Just a car did this. Ban cars. Out of
[25:17.080 --> 25:23.240]  solidarity towards those who do it for religious reasons. We have the topless in New York,
[25:23.240 --> 25:29.480]  in D.C., in Berlin videos. We've played them with the little, you know, what's covered
[25:29.480 --> 25:35.640]  up with the women up there. Lesbian women saying Allah Akbar, Allah Akbar and chanting
[25:35.640 --> 25:41.120]  Islamic chants when Muslims would kill them in two seconds. And there's no fallacy for
[25:41.120 --> 25:45.640]  them in their minds because only the West and the place that gave them the nest to have
[25:45.640 --> 25:50.080]  the freedom and have purple hair and tattoos. I don't care if you have purple hair and tattoos.
[25:50.080 --> 25:53.640]  Does it impress me? Does it not impress me? I see women with purple hair. Sometimes I
[25:53.640 --> 25:59.240]  like it. The point is, oh, you're so impressive. You're so avant-garde. You're so counterculture.
[25:59.240 --> 26:03.960]  That is the dominant cultures. Purple hair and tattoos everywhere. So fine. So now you
[26:03.960 --> 26:08.840]  want to like poop in your pants or something. You know, in Japan, they're all into cleanliness.
[26:08.840 --> 26:12.640]  Cleanest culture pretty much in history. And so the big fetish there for the last 50 years
[26:12.640 --> 26:17.320]  of decadence is people crap on themselves. I mean, I don't want to be gross here, but
[26:17.320 --> 26:21.200]  they have bars. They have a whole thing that's into it. It's the grossest thing. The Japanese
[26:21.200 --> 26:26.120]  were totally grossed out by that. You should be. So how do you become bad? You start pooping
[26:26.120 --> 26:30.400]  on yourself. And that's what this is. Let's put a headscarf on. Let's Allah Akbar. Let's
[26:30.400 --> 26:35.360]  allow genital mutilation of newborn girls. Oh, it's so liberal. Oh, it's so trendy. You
[26:35.360 --> 26:41.240]  know, oh, the news is all, oh, you know, the yogurt owner, the guy from Turkey, the works
[26:41.240 --> 26:47.720]  with George Soros and George Soros' law firm suing us. And they say in Bloomberg, I'm being
[26:47.720 --> 26:55.280]  sued for connecting refugees to rape and TB. And then I've got the mainstream news articles
[26:55.280 --> 27:02.640]  of in that town, TB is up 500%. That's political correctness. You will not say Muslims are
[27:02.640 --> 27:08.280]  connected to sex assault. You will not say any of it. You will never say that you will
[27:08.280 --> 27:17.760]  never say TB is going up. Is that understood, sir? Do you understand that? There is no leprosy
[27:17.760 --> 27:23.000]  coming in across the border. There is no drug resistance TB. There is no, there is no problem.
[27:23.000 --> 27:27.440]  The Venezuela has no diseases and is a wonderland with food growing on the trees everywhere
[27:27.440 --> 27:35.200]  and everyone is super rich. Communism is wonderful. Look at North Korea. And you're like, you
[27:35.200 --> 27:41.160]  look at the town, it's up 500%. They covered up the rape cases so that didn't exist. They
[27:41.160 --> 27:46.040]  finally plead guilty. The town says it's happening epidemic. The police and the mayor won't do
[27:46.040 --> 27:50.680]  it because they've been ordered not to. The mayor is the source that there's no rape in
[27:50.680 --> 27:58.040]  the town. It's like ABC News. The mayor doesn't think the plant is connected to rape full
[27:58.040 --> 28:06.200]  of Muslims. Can I go to Turkey and open up a yogurt plant and move in, say a couple thousand
[28:06.200 --> 28:13.040]  Texans and then have the women walk around without a hood on their head? No, no, no.
[28:13.040 --> 28:17.360]  But see, because we're tolerant, we're bad. So I've got to be so tolerant now that I have
[28:17.360 --> 28:22.040]  my wife wear a hijab, my daughters wear a hijab and then take them to Islamic doctors.
[28:22.040 --> 28:26.000]  They can pull out some scissors and cut their genitals off. I'm not going to do it. I stand
[28:26.000 --> 28:31.360]  against it because I'm a hate monger, right? That's up on infowars.com. That just goes
[28:31.360 --> 28:36.520]  on and on and on from there.
[28:36.520 --> 28:40.280]  Trump said that he was going to renegotiate NAFTA. Now he says he's not leaving it. They
[28:40.280 --> 28:43.840]  say he's flip-flopping. No, he said he's going to, I'm going to wait until he does.
[28:43.840 --> 28:53.800]  He said he's going to renegotiate NAFTA. That's up on infowars.com. Get those articles out.

[29:04.080 --> 29:07.520]  Let's show them like we did in the election. Whether Trump ends up being perfect or not,
[29:07.520 --> 29:12.080]  that doesn't matter. Nationalism is rising. People want it. The brand of liberty is the
[29:12.080 --> 29:15.960]  number one thing out there. We're going to win together. We're going to go to break and
[29:15.960 --> 29:19.520]  come back and David and I'll tell you about some of the big specials that end this weekend
[29:19.520 --> 29:26.000]  like 53% off the bone broth turmeric total paleo caveman formula. Not because it isn't
[29:26.000 --> 29:30.280]  one of our top five sellers because it's a lost leader at that price. Well, it's kind
[29:30.280 --> 29:35.600]  of for auto ship and 10% off. It certainly is because I want you to see how great it
[29:35.600 --> 29:40.440]  is. We've got the super blue kid's toothpaste almost sold out. We've got brain forces so
[29:40.440 --> 29:45.280]  much more, a bunch of specials at info wars.com. Please pray for me and my family. We really
[29:45.280 --> 29:49.240]  need it. The enemy's coming against us right now, but we do it with jolly spirit. All right,
[29:49.240 --> 29:57.960]  we'll be right back. March the empires on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[29:57.960 --> 30:06.840]  This is Owen shroyer for info wars.com. Listen to these headlines from just the last week.
[30:06.840 --> 30:12.760]  Four times in four days, Russian military aircraft fly off US coast. Some nuclear capable US sends
[30:12.760 --> 30:17.640]  nuclear sniffer plane to Korea. China test missile on deadly new destroyer ship near
[30:17.640 --> 30:23.800]  North Korea as it warns it's getting troops battle ready. US preparing to evacuate 230,000

[30:45.760 --> 30:51.800]  California coast. Entire US Senate called for meeting on North Korea briefing. And now
[30:51.800 --> 30:56.920]  NBC news is telling its audience what to do in case of a nuclear attack. Will this cold

[31:48.600 --> 31:53.080]  is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house replacing older, more expensive filters
[31:53.080 --> 31:59.400]  that didn't do as good a job. Find out why this system is so revolutionary today. Then for store.com.

[33:21.160 --> 33:24.440]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm David Knight on this Thursday.
[33:24.440 --> 33:31.160]  This is April the 27th. That's getting there pretty quickly, isn't it? We're nearly at the end
[33:31.160 --> 33:35.080]  of the month and we're about to get to Trump's 100 days. We're going to talk about the Trump
[33:35.080 --> 33:41.160]  tax plan as well as some movements in Obamacare repeal. Not really, but there's been a little bit
[33:41.160 --> 33:47.560]  of movement there. I think what he did with the Trump tax plan is exactly what he campaigned on.
[33:47.560 --> 33:53.480]  It is very close to what he campaigned on and it was a good move for Trump to get out in front of
[33:53.480 --> 33:58.840]  Paul Ryan. I'm going to talk about this. I'm going to show you how the major opposition on this,
[33:58.840 --> 34:04.120]  just like on Obamacare repeal, is coming from within the Republican Party. From within the
[34:04.120 --> 34:09.560]  Republican Party. They're the problem. We have, if Republicans were on the same page on this,
[34:10.120 --> 34:16.360]  if Republicans supported what the GOP platform said, what the GOP presidential candidate said,
[34:16.360 --> 34:23.000]  if they supported that, we would have a repeal of Obamacare when we would get this tax reform that
[34:23.560 --> 34:28.280]  was revealed yesterday by the Trump administration. So we're going to talk about the two developments
[34:28.280 --> 34:35.000]  there. We're also going to take a look at some of the mind issues that are coming out and the
[34:35.960 --> 34:39.880]  idiocracy that we're devolving into. But before we do real quickly, I just want to remind you that
[34:39.880 --> 34:47.000]  we have extended this sale for a limited time of caveman, our true paleo formula. We now have
[34:47.000 --> 34:53.480]  53% off the retail price. That's our caveman true paleo formula at infowarstore.com. That's an
[34:53.480 --> 34:59.640]  additional 20% off the already 33% sale that we had just before. This is for a limited time only
[34:59.640 --> 35:04.760]  while supplies last. And of course, the unique formulation behind caveman combines cutting
[35:04.760 --> 35:10.600]  edge nutraceutical science with ancient nutrition. By ancient nutrition, we're talking about bone
[35:10.600 --> 35:18.280]  broth. People have long known how nutritious bone broth is. Reviews this for a long time in my family.
[35:18.280 --> 35:23.560]  Now you can get this in a very easy, it takes a very long time to steep all this and you don't always
[35:23.560 --> 35:29.480]  have leftover bones that you can make a broth out of. So this is something you can do on a daily
[35:29.480 --> 35:36.120]  basis. It also, besides the bone broth, it adds turmeric root, chaga mushrooms, bee pollen,
[35:36.120 --> 35:41.480]  and many other ingredients in a true paleo nutrition formula. Again, you can get caveman
[35:41.480 --> 35:46.760]  for 53% off retail at infowarstore.com. Let me read you one of the reviews there because you can
[35:46.760 --> 35:51.800]  take a look at the reviews that we have there. It's maintained by a third party site. And here's
[35:51.800 --> 35:56.680]  one of them. The guy's name is Gerald. He says, great stuff, tastes great. Been using some other
[35:56.680 --> 36:02.360]  formulas from other brands, but caveman has a lot of great stuff in it. I like it and I recommend
[36:02.360 --> 36:07.560]  it. Also from Bren, he said, excellent product, tastes amazing, love the ingredients. I would
[36:07.560 --> 36:13.320]  recommend to everyone looking for a shake supplement. Again, you can get that at 53% off
[36:13.320 --> 36:19.720]  at infowarstore.com while supplies last. Let's take a quick look at what's going on with the
[36:19.720 --> 36:27.640]  brain issues. Of course, I've said brain force is my favorite supplement that we have here.
[36:27.640 --> 36:33.560]  And maybe when we take a look at this clip of Nancy Pelosi, maybe we should send her just out of
[36:33.560 --> 36:39.640]  sheer compassion, some free brain force for her to take. Maybe that will help her with
[36:39.640 --> 36:45.080]  these speeches. I don't know if she's being hacked or if this is just nature taking its course
[36:45.080 --> 36:50.200]  as we all get older. But before we do, before we take a look at Nancy Pelosi's speech here,
[36:51.000 --> 36:56.440]  I think it's interesting to see the Guardian talking about how we need to come up and codify
[36:56.440 --> 37:01.800]  some new human rights to protect us against being hacked, against our minds being hacked,
[37:02.520 --> 37:09.640]  and against brain data theft. Let me repeat that, brain data theft. This is the Guardian.
[37:09.640 --> 37:16.600]  Now, only a year or two ago, the Guardian and the New York Times and the rest of the mainstream media
[37:17.160 --> 37:22.440]  would have laughed at info wars. They would have called us 10 foil hat conspiracy theorists
[37:22.440 --> 37:25.960]  because we would have said, look, they're trying to read our minds. They're trying to control our
[37:25.960 --> 37:33.000]  minds. And of course, this is something that the government DARPA and others, the CIA, have been
[37:33.000 --> 37:40.040]  doing with MK ultra program. They created LSD, a lot of chemicals. Now they're taking a more
[37:40.040 --> 37:45.800]  electronic approach to it instead of a chemical approach. But this has been their goal for 50,
[37:45.800 --> 37:52.200]  60 years, trying to control people's minds, trying to read people's minds, and it's starting to become
[37:52.200 --> 37:59.560]  effective. And in addition to what DARPA is doing in the military, we also have the brain
[37:59.560 --> 38:04.920]  initiative from Barack Obama, starting out with about $200 million worth of funding.
[38:04.920 --> 38:11.320]  They're very serious about this. And you have to understand this technology is going to bear fruit.
[38:11.320 --> 38:15.080]  And now the mainstream media is even talking about it. You know, it's a done deal. You know,
[38:15.080 --> 38:20.440]  it's already been done. And so they're saying, well, the new human rights that would protect
[38:20.440 --> 38:24.120]  people from having their thoughts and other brain information stolen, abused or hacked have been
[38:24.120 --> 38:29.800]  proposed by researchers. Yeah, you need to make sure. And, you know, we might want to also,
[38:29.800 --> 38:34.840]  at the same time, we might want to also protect our freedom of movement so they don't lock us
[38:34.840 --> 38:41.800]  in the cities with agenda 21 and taking over our cars, taking the steering wheels out of our hands
[38:42.440 --> 38:49.400]  and making travel by permission only as they track our every movement, as they tax our every
[38:49.400 --> 38:56.440]  movement, as they monitor our every thought. This may sound like paranoia, but it is technological
[38:56.440 --> 39:01.320]  reality. It's going to be here very quickly. And we need to make sure that we understand this and
[39:01.320 --> 39:05.320]  we just don't dismiss this as science fiction. We've talked about this a long time and people
[39:05.320 --> 39:11.560]  used to make fun of Alex Jones for putting a piece of tape or post it over the camera on his
[39:11.560 --> 39:17.880]  monitor. They're not laughing about that anymore. You can see Zuckerberg putting it over his because
[39:17.880 --> 39:21.720]  his organization is doing it. You know, Zuckerberg goes out and says, oh, we're going to work on
[39:21.720 --> 39:27.240]  technology that will let you type using your mind. Oh, that sounds great, doesn't it? Except what he's
[39:27.240 --> 39:32.360]  really saying is Facebook is going to be working on technology to read your mind. And of course,
[39:33.560 --> 39:38.280]  they're not going to maintain your privacy. They're already collecting all kinds of information
[39:38.280 --> 39:42.920]  without your permission and using it without your permission. The government says anything that they
[39:42.920 --> 39:49.800]  collect on you belongs to them. It doesn't belong to you. Any data that they scrape on the internet
[39:50.440 --> 39:57.960]  by following you, by watching you, any of that belongs to them. This is an old doctrine going
[39:57.960 --> 40:03.160]  back to telephones, the old pen doctrine where they said, well, you know, we can, we can get some
[40:03.160 --> 40:06.360]  information from people about getting a search warrant. And so that's what the government is
[40:06.360 --> 40:11.080]  doing. That's why it was so important for them. They tried so many times with SISPA, multiple
[40:11.080 --> 40:17.400]  times with SISPA, then ACTA, SOPA, PIPPA. Then they took the P out of SISPA and they got it passed,
[40:17.400 --> 40:27.800]  CISA. We had Aaron Schwartz go to fight that very, very rigorously. And then they trumped
[40:27.800 --> 40:33.480]  up charges against him. There were total trumped up charges. And of course, his family said they
[40:33.480 --> 40:38.760]  drove him to suicide, saying that they were going to put him in jail for 30 years. And then the
[40:38.760 --> 40:44.120]  prosecutor's husband, as he was getting criticized for overzealous prosecution that drove him to
[40:44.120 --> 40:52.600]  suicide, the prosecutor's husband, her name is Ortiz, he, he tweeted out that she had offered
[40:52.600 --> 40:57.720]  him a deal just like three months in prison. And he turned it down. He was a fighter. You know,
[40:57.720 --> 41:03.960]  he's a meek guy, but he was tough. And he had fought SISPA many times, but they kept at it.
[41:03.960 --> 41:09.960]  They wanted that because with that, all this information that these people, Google, Facebook,
[41:09.960 --> 41:13.160]  Twitter, all of them are constantly monitoring everything that you're doing,
[41:13.160 --> 41:17.240]  all of that can be turned over to the government and you can't sue them. Or they can turn it over
[41:17.240 --> 41:21.800]  and they can sell it to people and you can't do anything about that. And of course, when you
[41:21.800 --> 41:28.680]  look at the situations that have come out, the, the fight back and forth, which really is a bureaucratic
[41:28.680 --> 41:34.680]  fight. Number one, the issue of whether or not your ISP, your internet service provider is going
[41:34.680 --> 41:42.760]  to be able to collect and monetize your data. That really is, in one aspect, it's a big fight over
[41:43.720 --> 41:48.440]  bureaucratic power, who is going to control and regulate the internet. But it's also a fight
[41:48.440 --> 41:53.000]  between corporations. Google, Facebook, these other social media companies, they already have the
[41:53.000 --> 41:59.960]  capability to do that. They don't want competition from your ISP. And so that is what's going on.
[41:59.960 --> 42:03.960]  You don't have privacy folks. The only question is how much deeper are they going to go before we
[42:03.960 --> 42:08.840]  start putting some restrictions on it? So that's why this, this article from The Guardian is interesting.
[42:08.840 --> 42:15.640]  They say they move to try to get human rights codified to protect our minds and our brains
[42:15.640 --> 42:21.480]  from having being manipulated or having data taken out of them. It says the response to rapid
[42:21.480 --> 42:26.440]  advances being made with technology is that reader alter brain activity and which many expect to
[42:26.440 --> 42:31.240]  bring enormous benefit to people's lives in the coming year. Be able to play video games with
[42:31.240 --> 42:36.520]  your mind, as they say. So those are the enormous benefits. Do you really think that being able
[42:36.520 --> 42:42.680]  to play video games with your mind, that being able to type on Facebook with your mind, do you
[42:42.680 --> 42:49.080]  really think that that is worth giving them access to your mind? We've had the military come in and
[42:49.080 --> 42:54.840]  say, well, we want to give our soldiers superhuman capabilities. That's the latest attack that we're
[42:54.840 --> 42:58.120]  seeing here from DARPA. But in the past, they've said we want to make sure that people who are
[42:58.120 --> 43:06.120]  suffering from PTSD that we can selectively remove memories. Or maybe we'll put some happy thoughts
[43:06.120 --> 43:13.960]  in there for you. Think about the implications of that. That is one of the worst sci-fi dystopian
[43:13.960 --> 43:18.920]  scenarios you can imagine. And that's what these people are actively working on and spending
[43:18.920 --> 43:25.400]  your taxpayer money doing. They have unlimited funds because we're not limited, folks, to the
[43:25.400 --> 43:32.440]  income tax. That is not our budget. They want us to be in debt. They don't fully pay it every year.
[43:32.440 --> 43:39.000]  The central bank, the Federal Reserve, they want us to be in their debt. They want to increase the
[43:39.000 --> 43:44.440]  welfare programs. That's what they did throughout all the third world. McNamara, when he got finished
[43:44.440 --> 43:49.880]  messing up everything with Vietnam, he went to work for the International Monetary Funds in
[43:49.880 --> 43:54.760]  the World Bank. And I forget which one of those he was at. But they were, I think it was the IMF,
[43:54.760 --> 44:00.360]  International Monetary Fund. They were accused of rent seeking because they encouraged all of these
[44:00.360 --> 44:06.760]  third world countries to ramp up their welfare system, not to build infrastructure, not to invest
[44:06.760 --> 44:11.560]  in capital or invest in manufacturing or whatever to help people get started in their countries.
[44:11.560 --> 44:16.840]  No, they just wanted them to create welfare and they would continue to loan them money.
[44:16.840 --> 44:20.520]  And they would continue to go into debt because it's not productive. We can see where that goes
[44:20.520 --> 44:28.600]  with Venezuela. So they said the IMF is engaging in rent seeking. Everything that they're doing now
[44:28.600 --> 44:34.440]  is rent seeking. They want to take over your cars. They want to lease the cars, not just
[44:35.080 --> 44:39.000]  the car itself, but they want to lease it to you by the ride. They don't want you to own it.
[44:39.000 --> 44:45.000]  They're seeking renters. They want you to be their perpetual renters. They want to make homes so
[44:45.000 --> 44:49.400]  expensive, so small, lock you up in the cities that you won't be able to own even your little coffin
[44:49.400 --> 44:55.560]  apartment. They want rent seeking. That's what it's all about. That's what the debt that we have
[44:55.560 --> 45:00.360]  is all about. It's the government, the federal reserve pushing all of that for us. And so when
[45:00.360 --> 45:04.280]  I look at what they're doing with all the the mine stuff, and then we've talked about this a
[45:04.280 --> 45:11.240]  long time, about how, yes, they really are trying to do things to you, and they make fun of it,
[45:11.240 --> 45:15.080]  and they show people sitting there with tinfoil wrapped around their head. I don't think that
[45:15.080 --> 45:20.680]  that is effective, but you better believe that they're looking for ways to read your mind.
[45:21.240 --> 45:26.040]  And of course, back in the 1980s, we had Michael Aquino, who was with the NSA, Colonel. He went
[45:26.040 --> 45:32.680]  on Oprah Winfrey dressed up like Eddie Munster, like a Satanist, openly talking about his Satanism,
[45:32.680 --> 45:42.280]  but also talking about how they would use ELF to control people's minds or attitudes or emotions,
[45:42.280 --> 45:47.560]  that type of thing. But let's take a look at Nancy Pelosi. Is she suffering from this already? Is
[45:47.560 --> 45:52.920]  she the first? Because quite frankly, I'm not saying that she is. I'm joking about this, folks,
[45:52.920 --> 45:56.440]  so that you don't think they're worth throwing out a conspiracy theory here. But understand
[45:56.440 --> 46:03.640]  that, I don't think, I think she's getting old, okay? But understand that just as we have seen
[46:03.640 --> 46:09.800]  the NSA and their dragnet surveillance, the deep state, turned first against politicians,
[46:10.360 --> 46:15.640]  they will use the mind control stuff first against politicians. So the very people
[46:16.600 --> 46:24.200]  who are going to be the most at risk for this are the ones who could fix it if they had a backbone,
[46:24.200 --> 46:28.440]  but they don't. They don't have a backbone. But let's take a look at Nancy Pelosi.
[46:28.440 --> 46:33.720]  Let's play this video for her. She garbles words, she mispronounces countries in a short speech,
[46:33.720 --> 46:38.040]  and when I saw this, it just reminded me of Max Headroom. So we put a little bit of Max Headroom
[46:38.040 --> 46:42.520]  here at the front of it for those of you who don't remember Max Headroom from the 1980s.
[46:43.080 --> 46:47.160]  What you're about to witness is one of the most sinister sounding intros to a trailer to one
[46:47.160 --> 46:53.560]  of the greatest epics ever produced in the history of television. There's more, because you are going
[46:53.560 --> 47:02.680]  to see it as well. Yes, it. Yes, it. So sit back, relax, and enjoy my film.
[47:05.560 --> 47:12.200]  And Hassan Shireh, for your well-deserved recognitions tonight to all today, the strong
[47:12.200 --> 47:18.600]  moral of our voice of refugees international. We degrade our values and our security when we
[47:18.600 --> 47:25.640]  slam the door in the face of children freeing fleeing atrocities with a specter of famine looming
[47:25.640 --> 47:31.880]  and over northeast Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, and you met and Yemen,
[47:32.520 --> 47:38.200]  almost slashing the State Department Department budget and foreign aid budget by 30%
[47:39.240 --> 47:46.360]  would only deepen the crisis by facing the children. Children. Children need America to
[47:46.360 --> 47:53.160]  be their champion. Thank you, refugees international, for your leadership. Thank you for your moral
[47:53.160 --> 48:01.240]  advocacy and your action. Thank you for challenging us to honor our values as a nation.
[48:01.240 --> 48:04.760]  Thank you all for the honor to participate this evening. Thank you so much.
[48:06.040 --> 48:09.800]  There you go. And as I point out on the American Mirror, she had one task,
[48:09.800 --> 48:16.440]  and that was to put to rest questions about her health. I think she went a little bit deeper
[48:16.440 --> 48:22.760]  into it right there. Okay, so there's a Reuters poll that came out. And the question that DC
[48:22.760 --> 48:29.240]  Clothesline asked is, can Americans even think for themselves anymore? Are we buying into this
[48:29.240 --> 48:35.160]  kind of tribalistic group think? And what Reuters did was they asked people to consider a series
[48:35.160 --> 48:39.880]  of statements that President Trump had made on things like taxes, crime, the news media,
[48:39.880 --> 48:44.280]  and a lot of other issues. And they got Democrats and they got Republicans and they would take a
[48:44.280 --> 48:48.120]  control group and they would read the statements to them, not telling them who had said it.
[48:48.840 --> 48:52.600]  And then they would, to the other group, tell them that President Trump had said it. Well,
[48:52.600 --> 48:58.680]  the Democrats then, the disagreement went way up. And for the Republicans, the agreement went
[48:58.680 --> 49:06.200]  way up. See, what is concerning about this is that this is really kind of a form of identity
[49:06.200 --> 49:11.320]  politics. It's kind of a form of tribalism. We have to look at this. It's like the situation
[49:11.320 --> 49:15.640]  Chuck Schumer said the other day. He said, if we get into a situation where Breitbart and
[49:15.640 --> 49:21.400]  New York Times are both considered, then we've lost democracy. It's like, no, if you do that,
[49:21.400 --> 49:27.160]  then people are thinking for themselves. You shouldn't disregard somebody because of the
[49:27.160 --> 49:30.920]  source. And the source of these statements, because they're coming from President Trump,
[49:30.920 --> 49:34.920]  doesn't make them true. It doesn't make them false. It doesn't make things true or false
[49:34.920 --> 49:41.720]  simply because Breitbart or the New York Times says it. Now, we understand because we look at
[49:41.720 --> 49:46.360]  this and we might disagree so often with what the New York Times says and we agree with maybe
[49:46.360 --> 49:51.800]  Breitbart or whatever. So maybe we're skewed with that and that does, you can't help but be influenced
[49:51.800 --> 49:56.040]  by that. But you've got to not fall into this identity politics and this kind of tribalism
[49:56.040 --> 50:00.200]  into celebrity politics. Today, we had on the Dredge Report. They had the rock up.
[50:00.200 --> 50:05.160]  Dwayne Johnson didn't even read the article. It's not the celebrity that we need. We don't
[50:05.160 --> 50:11.720]  need celebrity. We need a populist that thinks for itself. It's absolutely amazing. And are we
[50:11.720 --> 50:18.120]  even capable of that? Take a look at these stories about Nordstrom selling $425 genes that are covered
[50:18.120 --> 50:24.200]  in fake mud. Seriously? Call it Nordstrom. They've got these things selling as they point out in the
[50:24.200 --> 50:29.720]  story more than a 40-inch television because they have these genes that perpetually look dirty.
[50:30.520 --> 50:36.520]  Okay? So now it's not enough to look ragged but now you can buy jeans, jackets, even shoes that
[50:36.520 --> 50:42.280]  look perpetually dirty. So I guess presumably you can look like some hippie from Berkeley or
[50:42.280 --> 50:48.600]  something as a guy who has a show called Dirty Job said they're a costume for wealthy people who
[50:48.600 --> 50:56.360]  see work as ironic, not iconic. It's absolutely insane. Where does this all end? Well, it doesn't.
[50:56.360 --> 51:03.960]  Stay with us to be right back. This is the story of the shaving company called Harry's
[51:03.960 --> 51:09.400]  in an epic battle of David versus Goliath. In the early 1980s, a child was born. Two of them,
[51:09.400 --> 51:14.360]  actually. Their names were Jeff and Andy. Time went by, they developed facial hair,
[51:14.360 --> 51:19.720]  and one day something happened. Andy got ripped off buying overpriced razors. So they decided to
[51:19.720 --> 51:24.360]  start their own shaving company and fix shaving once and for all. They hired the best designers,
[51:24.360 --> 51:29.400]  they bought a 95-year-old German blade factory, and they started selling high-quality razors online
[51:29.400 --> 51:34.120]  with no upcharging direct to customers. How did the overpriced razor company respond?
[51:34.120 --> 51:38.680]  By threatening to sue their pants off. Don't worry, Jeff and Andy have plenty of pants and
[51:38.680 --> 51:44.200]  a relentless dream to get all guys a great shave at a great price. Try Harry's free. They'll send
[51:44.200 --> 51:49.160]  you a razor with five German blades, foaming shave gel, and even a travel blade cover when you sign

[54:16.920 --> 54:21.560]  but in the next hour we're going to be talking to bill jasper from the new american we're and talk
[54:21.560 --> 54:26.040]  about free speech we're going to talk about the un it's getting involved in free speech and of course
[54:26.040 --> 54:32.760]  i'm sure he's going to want to talk about the un's involvement on monday with president trump
[54:32.760 --> 54:38.280]  and north korea uh before we get back to the news just want to remind you that we have a limited
[54:38.280 --> 54:43.480]  supply of dna force coming to info war store dot com it's been sold out for months at info
[54:43.480 --> 54:49.560]  war store dot com it's very difficult and expensive to do batches of dna force because
[54:49.560 --> 54:57.240]  of one of the key ingredients in it that is very unique bio pqq and we have uh over 170
[54:57.960 --> 55:02.440]  studies that you can take a look at at info war store dot com that'll tell you about that but it's
[55:02.440 --> 55:08.840]  got a lot of other things in it as well coq 10 systemic enzymes bio pqq and many other things
[55:08.840 --> 55:14.360]  take a look at the reviews take a look at some of the research about what bio pqq does for you
[55:14.360 --> 55:22.040]  and of course in a nutshell if you think of your shoelaces and twist them like a dna strand you've
[55:22.040 --> 55:28.760]  got a cap on your shoelaces on dna that's called a telomere as that starts to erode naturally over
[55:28.760 --> 55:34.360]  time the strand starts to unravel just like your shoelaces would so just like you got a cap on your
[55:34.360 --> 55:38.680]  shoelaces to keep them from unraveling now you have the telomere to do that and you can actually
[55:38.680 --> 55:45.800]  studies have looked at it the life expectancy of someone can be pretty much interpolated
[55:45.800 --> 55:52.200]  pretty accurately from looking at the length of their telomeres so bio pqq has had a lot of studies
[55:52.200 --> 55:58.520]  that show that has an effect on that in particular but take a look at dna force if you want to get
[55:58.520 --> 56:04.200]  on the list as it comes back in stock you can now sign up for that because it's in such high demand
[56:04.200 --> 56:11.080]  again dna force coming up again at infowarstore.com and you can get on the list there okay going back
[56:11.080 --> 56:17.640]  to where we just wore i mean it's not just these insane jeans and i had nico tell me on the earpiece
[56:17.640 --> 56:23.160]  here that uh norsens also been selling like a large rock that's wrapped in leather or in a leather
[56:23.160 --> 56:27.320]  pocket or something they're selling these four hundred twenty five dollar jeans that are covered
[56:27.320 --> 56:31.960]  in fake mud and of course you can get a jacket that's covered in fake mud to look like you're
[56:31.960 --> 56:36.600]  really working or something i don't really understand they know what their their market is
[56:37.480 --> 56:41.880]  it seems like a total idiocracy in my opinion but then of course here's another part of
[56:41.880 --> 56:47.880]  idiocracy we've got bmw and of course they own many they have successfully developed a car that
[56:47.880 --> 56:54.120]  will change colors based on the driver's mood this is the silliness of our technology that's coming
[56:54.120 --> 57:00.520]  up nothing that's going to make it any safer or working better and this is the most amazing thing
[57:00.520 --> 57:04.760]  these are the people who are working so hard to make sure that you're not even going to be driving
[57:04.760 --> 57:10.520]  your car so who cares what your mood is inside i mean you know if uh if you wanted to know if
[57:10.520 --> 57:15.240]  somebody's got road rage and you you could see that coming down the road that might be a useful
[57:15.240 --> 57:20.440]  guide but still it's just it's absolutely amazing and yet we continue to see this ikeas laughing
[57:20.440 --> 57:25.320]  about the fact that uh they've got a bag that looks that they sell for 99 cents a tote bag
[57:25.320 --> 57:31.000]  and a high fashion outlet has put one out that looks exactly like it except for the ikea name
[57:31.000 --> 57:40.600]  on the handle for 2145 dollars so by putting the ikea label on the handle they knock 2144
[57:40.600 --> 57:46.200]  dollars off of that of that product this is the idiocracy that we have but then here seriously
[57:46.200 --> 57:52.440]  folks when we look at the story from Daily Mail talking about a military analyst who looked at
[57:52.440 --> 57:57.720]  the military parades that they had and we've pointed out the rocket that had the bent nose cone
[57:57.720 --> 58:05.080]  on it and one military expert looked at it and said look uh even their sunglasses are fake but he
[58:05.080 --> 58:09.960]  said uh these these are fake guns they don't have rpgs and of course part of the reason for that is
[58:09.960 --> 58:16.600]  they don't want any of those soldiers to fire an rpg at kim jong-un while he's watching their parade
[58:16.600 --> 58:23.240]  but you also have to remember just like we heard uh and wag the dog we had robert denaro say it's
[58:23.240 --> 58:27.480]  a pageant it's just a pageant you have to understand when they're showing all these
[58:27.480 --> 58:31.400]  videos about blowing up the white house a lot of that is for internal consumption
[58:31.400 --> 58:37.960]  they don't have the capability to do it let's not let them railroad us into a war not them
[58:37.960 --> 58:47.240]  not our general stay with us i'll be right back you are listening to gcn visit gcnlive.com today

[59:23.560 --> 59:28.440]  there's a reason the department of defense chose defender to manufacture their new line of advanced

[1:00:23.160 --> 1:00:30.840]  welcome back to the alex jones show in the next segment we're going to be talking to
[1:00:30.840 --> 1:00:38.520]  william jasper the new american have an article of his news alternative real and fake he's going
[1:00:38.520 --> 1:00:43.240]  to be talking about the many ways in which we see censorship coming at us and of course we also
[1:00:43.240 --> 1:00:49.400]  want to talk to him about the new role for the united nations that donald trump seems to envision
[1:00:49.400 --> 1:00:53.880]  there's some very troubling con comments that he made that i talked about last night in the nightly
[1:00:53.880 --> 1:01:02.280]  news saying that the united nations is underperforming but he sees a very big future for him in the
[1:01:02.280 --> 1:01:06.600]  future he thinks that they should be the ones to solve international conflicts that they should
[1:01:06.600 --> 1:01:13.480]  impose solutions on different nations that's a very different tact when donald trump was
[1:01:13.480 --> 1:01:17.720]  campaigning and when he first took office he was saying that the united nations needed to be scaled
[1:01:17.720 --> 1:01:23.320]  back that it was a globalist cabal working for the bankers and he was absolutely right about that
[1:01:23.320 --> 1:01:29.480]  now he is talking to the united nation security council on monday interestingly before he talks
[1:01:29.480 --> 1:01:35.880]  to the senate before he talks to the house about what's going on in north korea is he getting
[1:01:35.880 --> 1:01:43.960]  permission from international agencies as we saw leon panetta tell then senator jeff sessions they
[1:01:43.960 --> 1:01:49.240]  said we're going to talk to nato we're going to talk to the un and our allies and we'll make a
[1:01:49.240 --> 1:01:52.760]  decision about what we're going to do about conflicts around the world and then we'll
[1:01:52.760 --> 1:01:58.280]  probably inform you probably inform you so he is informing them maybe of what they have already
[1:01:58.280 --> 1:02:05.400]  decided i don't know but it the order is in reverse it should be the decision of the american people
[1:02:05.400 --> 1:02:09.880]  and their elected representatives they should declare war they should declare what the strategy is
[1:02:09.880 --> 1:02:14.680]  and then we should have them there's that clip where they were going back and forth a very famous
[1:02:14.680 --> 1:02:18.360]  clip that we played we don't have time to play that right now but of course we also had some
[1:02:18.360 --> 1:02:23.160]  other movements yesterday we had donald trump and we're going to talk about this uh after the
[1:02:23.160 --> 1:02:29.880]  interviews i want to talk about the tax cut it's a very good tax cut plan they had uh exactly what
[1:02:29.880 --> 1:02:37.720]  they had run on pretty much and uh i think it's good that donald trump got out ahead of paul ryan
[1:02:37.720 --> 1:02:41.960]  because i think it was a big mistake to let paul ryan put together obama care and we're still
[1:02:42.920 --> 1:02:47.800]  playing around with obama care they're still uh beating up on the conservatives who want to get
[1:02:47.800 --> 1:02:52.920]  repeal and it looks like the conservatives are now going to cave they call the people who are
[1:02:52.920 --> 1:02:59.000]  opposing this interestingly enough just like they call this ross child banker who's running for the
[1:02:59.000 --> 1:03:08.040]  presidency of france macron they call these republicans centrists why aren't they hard liners why are
[1:03:08.040 --> 1:03:14.920]  they people who refuse to do anything about this socialistic fascist and i'm talking about economic
[1:03:14.920 --> 1:03:21.560]  fascism crony capitalism this obama care system that we've got is both socialist in that it
[1:03:21.560 --> 1:03:25.800]  redistributes income from some people to other people for health care for health insurance i
[1:03:25.800 --> 1:03:33.080]  should say and it is also crony capitalism economic fascism and that it forces us to buy products
[1:03:33.800 --> 1:03:41.560]  from corporations and it directly subsidizes those corporations that's wrong it's morally wrong
[1:03:41.560 --> 1:03:47.000]  it's economically wrong it's unconstitutional and i don't care what the supreme court says the supreme
[1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:52.040]  court has been on both sides of a lot of issues including slavery freedom of speech many other
[1:03:52.040 --> 1:03:58.120]  things and they are wrong on this issue just like they're wrong on abortion but they're
[1:03:58.120 --> 1:04:03.160]  obviously wrong about this so we're obviously blackmailed why aren't these people being called
[1:04:03.160 --> 1:04:08.840]  radicals why aren't they being called obstructionist these republicans who want to fight obama care
[1:04:08.840 --> 1:04:14.280]  repeal why are they being called hard liners it's absolutely amazing to me these are the people
[1:04:15.080 --> 1:04:21.080]  that trump praised and they criticize the people who want to stand up for the campaign promises so
[1:04:21.080 --> 1:04:27.080]  obama care repeal has gone completely south and interestingly enough we've got california now
[1:04:27.080 --> 1:04:33.560]  going on to full socialism california single payer health care bill passes the first committee
[1:04:33.560 --> 1:04:40.840]  test and they say that democrats and republicans however have signaled unease they said the major
[1:04:40.840 --> 1:04:45.320]  question is how are they going to pay for it well they don't have money to pay for it they're talking
[1:04:45.320 --> 1:04:49.800]  about universal health care and i'm talking about literally worldwide universal health care they're
[1:04:49.800 --> 1:04:55.800]  going to give everything to people regardless of their legal immigration status and they don't have
[1:04:55.800 --> 1:05:00.360]  any way to pay for it this is the path to venezuela stay with us we'll be right back
[1:05:01.560 --> 1:05:06.520]  trump just signed an executive order to pull the federal government out of k through 12 education
[1:05:06.520 --> 1:05:11.400]  following through on a campaign promise to return school control to state and local officials titled
[1:05:11.400 --> 1:05:16.920]  education federalism executive order it directs education secretary betsy devos to launch a 300
[1:05:16.920 --> 1:05:21.880]  day review of obama air regulations and guidance for school districts and gives her the power to
[1:05:21.880 --> 1:05:26.920]  modify or repeal measures she deems and overreach by the federal government it was amazing to hear
[1:05:26.920 --> 1:05:31.720]  liberals scream and cry as betsy devos was being confirmed and all i was saying the entire time
[1:05:31.720 --> 1:05:36.280]  was good we need to get rid of the department of education you wonder why your local schools don't
[1:05:36.280 --> 1:05:40.760]  have money to pay teachers or for upkeep it's because that money is being held by the federal
[1:05:40.760 --> 1:05:45.400]  government don't believe me just read the book the deliberate dumbing down of america by charlotte
[1:05:45.400 --> 1:05:50.440]  israbi she was a whistleblower from the department of education in the 1980s and her tomb describes

[1:08:59.640 --> 1:09:05.640]  william f jasper is the senior editor of the new american he is has a very well-earned reputation
[1:09:05.640 --> 1:09:11.320]  as one of america's top investigative reporters he's written several books global tyranny step by
[1:09:11.320 --> 1:09:17.240]  step the united nations exposed and of course twice a year the new american publishes a congressional
[1:09:17.240 --> 1:09:21.880]  scorecard called the freedom index that rates every member of the us house and senate on key
[1:09:21.880 --> 1:09:27.560]  issues so i want to talk to uh he had an article earlier this week about what's going on with
[1:09:27.560 --> 1:09:33.640]  freedom of the press and of course it's uh been in the news a lot we have um the fights that are
[1:09:33.640 --> 1:09:38.440]  going on in berkeley with and culture trying to shut down free speech of course the left used to
[1:09:39.880 --> 1:09:44.280]  vigorously defend freedom of speech now they don't even defend that they don't want to they would
[1:09:44.280 --> 1:09:50.760]  try to censor anything that they don't agree with and uh right there it's in the um the institution
[1:09:50.760 --> 1:09:55.160]  that we have janet napolitano as president of i don't think we've talked enough about that but
[1:09:55.160 --> 1:09:59.400]  i want to talk to him about that i also want to talk to him about this meeting that donald trump had
[1:09:59.400 --> 1:10:04.840]  with an un uh net security council earlier this week and some of the comments that came out of
[1:10:04.840 --> 1:10:09.080]  that were reported in the new american so i want to talk to him about that as well but let's talk
[1:10:09.080 --> 1:10:14.280]  about uh what's going on the freedom of press uh first thank you for joining us uh mr jasper
[1:10:17.160 --> 1:10:24.200]  we don't have any audio do you guys have audio i think um okay let's let's uh am i coming through
[1:10:24.200 --> 1:10:29.640]  okay now we got now we got it go ahead okay all right yeah thank you for joining us are we on
[1:10:30.200 --> 1:10:35.800]  we got it now go ahead okay it's great being back with you David thank you now you were saying
[1:10:35.800 --> 1:10:43.160]  um on tuesday you had an article you said uh all times uh it's a tough time to be a patriot we have
[1:10:43.160 --> 1:10:48.840]  to take a stand for truth and part of that is being able to read the truth to speak the truth
[1:10:48.840 --> 1:10:54.360]  to communicate to push ideas back and forth and in this you recall the warnings that matt drudge
[1:10:54.360 --> 1:11:01.000]  made when he visited info wars saying uh you thought that obama care was shocking he said you
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:05.000]  thought some of these other decisions were shocking wait until these copyright laws
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:09.080]  work their way up and the supreme court decides you can't have a website with news headlines
[1:11:09.080 --> 1:11:16.360]  linking across the board we're getting pretty close to that aren't we well we are and the article
[1:11:16.360 --> 1:11:23.320]  that you referred to there on the news fake alternative fake uh real uh is part of a five
[1:11:23.960 --> 1:11:30.760]  article package in the print magazine and which we have broken with tradition put it all online
[1:11:30.760 --> 1:11:38.680]  uh this time as well and it's it's a comprehensive survey of what's happening
[1:11:38.680 --> 1:11:47.320]  in the media with controls uh uh both political overt political controls where government uh in
[1:11:47.320 --> 1:11:55.160]  it's very obvious in communist china in russia in the muslim countries and in the increasingly
[1:11:55.160 --> 1:12:03.080]  oppressive regimes of the european union and of canada where political correctness has been taken
[1:12:03.080 --> 1:12:10.760]  to uh whole new levels just in the past a few years any uh freedom of expression is being uh stamped
[1:12:10.760 --> 1:12:18.120]  out and so that is being done by governments but then we also look in these articles at the ways
[1:12:18.120 --> 1:12:27.720]  in which uh corporate america and the globalist corporate organizations like google facebook
[1:12:27.720 --> 1:12:35.080]  etc you've been covering this as well uh apple uh yahoo has been censoring the news and have
[1:12:35.080 --> 1:12:42.920]  explicitly come out saying they are going to uh censor uh black ball those sites which they
[1:12:42.920 --> 1:12:48.760]  consider to be hate speech sites hate crime sites uh so that's one of the levels as well
[1:12:48.760 --> 1:12:56.920]  and then a very important part that we cover as well is the the deep state uh fake news thing
[1:12:56.920 --> 1:13:02.040]  where we have the intelligence agencies which are a branch of the government but which are not
[1:13:02.600 --> 1:13:08.760]  operating under the laws that one can just look at and say if they pass the law saying that
[1:13:08.760 --> 1:13:13.080]  we're going to censor this that's one thing but when they're doing it secretly through
[1:13:13.080 --> 1:13:20.760]  the intelligence agencies and they can take control of your computer via the internet
[1:13:20.760 --> 1:13:28.840]  if they can hack your website and shut it down we've had our website shut down a number of times
[1:13:28.840 --> 1:13:35.080]  it appeared at the times that they were the attacks were coming from china we that's what
[1:13:35.080 --> 1:13:42.040]  the security people believed was the case but as we've reported and i believe you have as well
[1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:50.440]  it's been documented now that the cia and the nsa and perhaps some of our other agencies have now
[1:13:50.440 --> 1:13:59.240]  the software the capabilities to hack a website and make it appear that it's isis or china or
[1:13:59.240 --> 1:14:08.920]  russia or some others and thereby escape any uh condemnation for that and of course it's alarming
[1:14:08.920 --> 1:14:17.800]  if china or russia or some other totalitarian regime is hacking our computers and hacking our
[1:14:17.800 --> 1:14:25.400]  internet sites uh it should be more frightening to americans if our own government is doing that
[1:14:25.400 --> 1:14:32.600]  and as we point out in a couple of the articles the albana administration has taken this several
[1:14:32.600 --> 1:14:40.360]  steps forward with its nudge squad program which it has modeled after the british intelligence
[1:14:40.360 --> 1:14:48.280]  model where they we quote in there and give uh excerpts from it where they say the the purpose
[1:14:48.280 --> 1:14:57.160]  is to destroy the fame uh discredit by publishing things on somebody else's website that will make
[1:14:57.160 --> 1:15:05.080]  them uh look bad so these are all things that we're having to deal with now and you're dealing with
[1:15:05.080 --> 1:15:10.360]  it right now at info wars oh yeah yeah we've seen also the economic attacks that happen where they
[1:15:10.360 --> 1:15:17.400]  try to destroy you by boycotts or by delisting ads or by lawsuits if you expose their crony
[1:15:17.400 --> 1:15:22.680]  capitalism as we did with ciabani yogurt we talk about a guy who comes here gets nearly a million
[1:15:22.680 --> 1:15:28.280]  dollars in government subsidies he gets subsidized factories he gets subsidized refugee workers and
[1:15:28.280 --> 1:15:34.920]  of course he goes everywhere from davos to the un to cbs 60 minutes promoting refugees but doesn't
[1:15:34.920 --> 1:15:39.320]  want to take any responsibility for anything that goes wrong with it but it's a massive case of
[1:15:39.320 --> 1:15:44.200]  of crony capitalism i mean could i go to turkey and get them to give me a million dollars to
[1:15:44.200 --> 1:15:48.920]  open up a factory there would they let me then set on their central banking committee
[1:15:48.920 --> 1:15:52.360]  and manipulate their currency as he does on the new york fed i mean that that's the type of thing
[1:15:52.360 --> 1:15:57.720]  that we're looking at but when you talked about the vault seven and we see that the government
[1:15:57.720 --> 1:16:03.320]  is coming in there and and able to directly then try to electronically shut us down so they try to
[1:16:03.320 --> 1:16:09.720]  shut us down by economics they try to shut us down electronically but i think it's very interesting
[1:16:09.720 --> 1:16:15.960]  when we look at the vault seven situation we now have uh we have have a reversal from the
[1:16:15.960 --> 1:16:19.800]  trump administration where they were saying hey this is great we got this information from wiki
[1:16:19.800 --> 1:16:25.080]  leaks and of course that wasn't secure information that was there that was information about the dnc
[1:16:25.080 --> 1:16:30.680]  and hillary's emails and so forth and so on many people have said that those wiki leaks said that
[1:16:30.680 --> 1:16:36.680]  they got that handed to them by people inside the dnc that were upset about the election being hacked
[1:16:36.680 --> 1:16:43.240]  against bernie sanders uh then people who were consultants for the dnc who were being paid
[1:16:43.240 --> 1:16:47.640]  by the dnc he said no no this was hacked it was stolen from us by the russians and so
[1:16:47.640 --> 1:16:54.600]  tried to get the fbi involved in that nevertheless when we look at this uh mr jasper the uh vault
[1:16:54.600 --> 1:16:59.880]  seven stuff was uh i've seen publication i'm not sure about this but the ci is very upset about
[1:16:59.880 --> 1:17:03.960]  this they want to go after wiki leaks they say we've got to stop these kinds of attacks and yet
[1:17:03.960 --> 1:17:08.360]  that information i don't think is classified or copyrighted because i've seen people argue that
[1:17:08.360 --> 1:17:15.160]  if it was classified and they put that on your computer then the cia themselves could be prosecuted
[1:17:15.160 --> 1:17:19.560]  for releasing secrets and if they copyrighted it then everybody would know what it is but
[1:17:19.560 --> 1:17:23.400]  everybody knows what it is now anyway and the people who work with them like google absolutely don't
[1:17:23.400 --> 1:17:31.560]  want to fix it right and and so that's this uh uh nebulous world that we're in right now where
[1:17:31.560 --> 1:17:37.720]  uh the powers that be and those that are exercising these huge powers within the
[1:17:37.720 --> 1:17:44.760]  intelligence agencies without oversight from congress and and again it gets back to uh congress
[1:17:44.760 --> 1:17:49.640]  abdicating responsibility and congress has abdicated responsibility because too many american
[1:17:49.640 --> 1:17:56.120]  citizens have abdicated their responsibility to insist that congress uh monitor these things
[1:17:56.120 --> 1:18:00.680]  not just the intelligence agencies but all of the regulatory agencies that they have created
[1:18:00.680 --> 1:18:08.840]  and allowed to run amok so uh that's a very good point that you make about the vault seven
[1:18:09.480 --> 1:18:17.560]  marble and and the other things that have come out in vault seven uh the uh cia and nsa are in
[1:18:17.560 --> 1:18:23.240]  rather difficult position here because they can't have it both ways they can't say that it's classified
[1:18:23.240 --> 1:18:29.640]  and therefore those who who have received it should be prosecuted uh if they're putting it on other
[1:18:29.640 --> 1:18:35.160]  people's computers and uh they can't just say that it's copyrighted and and prosecute you for
[1:18:35.160 --> 1:18:41.080]  violating copyright either you know it's interesting as i said we we've got so many different ways
[1:18:41.080 --> 1:18:45.720]  in which they're coming after us is because it's been effective the internet has allowed us
[1:18:45.720 --> 1:18:50.520]  to get this information out and it's allowed people to talk about things that were always
[1:18:50.520 --> 1:18:56.680]  censored you know when we talk about censorship uh they can be what is chosen to be discussed you
[1:18:56.680 --> 1:19:02.840]  and i both remember when we just had abc cbs and bc is the nightly news and they would all talk about
[1:19:02.840 --> 1:19:07.640]  exactly the same issues and of course they all had the same take on it you know the cia operation
[1:19:07.640 --> 1:19:11.800]  mockingbird was helping them with that okay but they would talk about the same issues they would
[1:19:11.800 --> 1:19:17.240]  have the same perspective on those same issues so to have a different perspective to bring up
[1:19:17.240 --> 1:19:21.880]  different issues is what they cannot stand and so they're coming at us bureaucratically with
[1:19:21.880 --> 1:19:28.200]  regulations over the internet they're coming after us economically uh by stopping ads and
[1:19:28.200 --> 1:19:33.320]  other things like that lawsuits they're coming after us with hacks and shutting us down in the
[1:19:33.320 --> 1:19:39.320]  sense that and and you can make that analogy as to uh an old style uh western town where the uh
[1:19:39.320 --> 1:19:44.200]  newspaper is not printing uh what the boss hog mayor wants and they come in and they bust up the
[1:19:44.200 --> 1:19:48.040]  printing press i mean that's really what they're trying to do that kind of thuggish uh tactic and
[1:19:48.040 --> 1:19:52.600]  then intimidating the distribution so there's many ways that they're attacking us stay with us when
[1:19:52.600 --> 1:19:57.720]  we come back i want to get your comments now on what's going on with the un about a constitutional
[1:19:57.720 --> 1:20:02.760]  declaration of war what is trump doing is he doing a complete reversal stay with us communities

[1:24:14.040 --> 1:24:18.040]  welcome back to the alex joneshaw and david and we're talking to william f jasper he is a senior
[1:24:18.040 --> 1:24:23.480]  editor of the new american publication of the john birch society we were talking in the last
[1:24:23.480 --> 1:24:30.360]  segment about an extended series of articles that they did something that they usually
[1:24:30.360 --> 1:24:34.520]  do the extended articles just on the magazine that you can get on a bi-monthly basis but they put
[1:24:34.520 --> 1:24:38.840]  this one online because it's very important what's happening to the first amendment and you know
[1:24:39.480 --> 1:24:45.320]  it seems like yesterday that matt drudge was here but it was back in october 6 2015 i didn't realize
[1:24:45.320 --> 1:24:51.560]  it was that long ago he talks about what matt drudge was saying in terms of the threat to free
[1:24:51.560 --> 1:24:56.040]  speech and now we're seeing that in many different ways but i want to change now this last segment
[1:24:56.040 --> 1:25:00.440]  that we've got with mr jasper and i want to talk about what's going on with the un because it's
[1:25:00.440 --> 1:25:04.360]  something that he's written about he's written a book on the un you united nations exposed
[1:25:04.920 --> 1:25:10.120]  and we had on monday we had donald trump meeting with united nations security council about north
[1:25:10.120 --> 1:25:15.960]  korea and it was very troubling there's an article on the new american uh in bizarre reversal trump
[1:25:15.960 --> 1:25:23.720]  seeks to empower the un i think it's very disturbing uh we we saw candidate trump and actually early
[1:25:23.720 --> 1:25:30.200]  days of his administration uh saying that the un was a globalist cabal for international bankers
[1:25:30.200 --> 1:25:34.040]  that they were seeking a global government for humanity and he was exactly right but now he's
[1:25:34.040 --> 1:25:40.520]  saying the united nations is an under performer but it has huge potential and he told them on monday
[1:25:40.520 --> 1:25:45.400]  i see a day when there's a conflict where the united nations you get together you solve the
[1:25:45.400 --> 1:25:51.000]  conflict you see a problem with that i do i think it's going to start happening now i can see it and
[1:25:51.000 --> 1:25:55.000]  the united nations will get together and solve conflicts it won't be two countries it'll be the
[1:25:55.000 --> 1:26:01.000]  united nations mediating or arbitrating with those countries in other words imposing a solution
[1:26:01.000 --> 1:26:06.920]  he said so i see fantastic potential fantastic things ahead for the united nations looked like
[1:26:06.920 --> 1:26:11.800]  mr jasper that donald trump was going to cut you in funding and we were all hopeful about that and
[1:26:11.800 --> 1:26:18.920]  it's by the fact that he put a very uh statist neocon uh as ambassador to the un nicky hailey
[1:26:18.920 --> 1:26:24.760]  but now it looks like this is all turned around so they can get a war with north korea well it
[1:26:24.760 --> 1:26:31.320]  it certainly is disturbing on the north korean front and the article that you just mentioned
[1:26:31.320 --> 1:26:37.880]  is by my colleague alex newman about president trump's meeting with the un security council
[1:26:37.880 --> 1:26:46.120]  ambassadors at the white house that was on monday and alex quotes many of the important
[1:26:46.120 --> 1:26:52.120]  points from that meeting which if you want to read it in the full context uh you can go to
[1:26:52.120 --> 1:27:01.080]  the remarks by the president at white house dot gov on april 24 and uh it's really very disturbing
[1:27:01.080 --> 1:27:07.880]  because it's it seems like a complete reversal of everything that he said about his anti-globalism
[1:27:07.880 --> 1:27:17.000]  anti-un uh during the campaign uh in fact he's just falling all over himself in this meeting
[1:27:17.000 --> 1:27:23.320]  about how important these people on the un security council are how important the the united
[1:27:23.320 --> 1:27:29.800]  nations itself is how all this important work that it meets that it needs to do must go forward
[1:27:29.800 --> 1:27:35.960]  uh he just he says they're in his comments to them though i've been very critical about
[1:27:36.760 --> 1:27:41.480]  your expenditures your budgets uh you know things have been out of control but i think
[1:27:41.480 --> 1:27:47.000]  we can reform it and i think we can get this back into a proper perspective he says and if
[1:27:47.000 --> 1:27:51.720]  if you do your job right and you solve all these problems in the world i'm not even concerned
[1:27:51.720 --> 1:28:00.840]  about the budget so i mean it's a complete denial of the dictator's club and the tyrannical uh
[1:28:01.800 --> 1:28:07.240]  underpinnings and uh basis of the united nations which i've written about in my book i was a
[1:28:07.240 --> 1:28:13.160]  correspondent and at accredited correspondent at the united nations for three decades and have attended
[1:28:13.160 --> 1:28:18.680]  most of their conferences and written about this for for decades and it's very clear that from the
[1:28:18.680 --> 1:28:26.840]  very beginning as as we've documented the united nations was planned to become a world
[1:28:26.840 --> 1:28:32.920]  government it wasn't a forum for people to come together and talk and and avoid war in fact it
[1:28:32.920 --> 1:28:42.280]  contemplates and expects war war waged by this world body it will have world government powers
[1:28:42.280 --> 1:28:49.000]  executive legislative judicial and military and police powers and that is where that is where
[1:28:49.000 --> 1:28:54.280]  the globalists are headed so and to get all those military powers for a globalist government they
[1:28:54.280 --> 1:28:59.080]  have to have a tax revenue and so they have to create a global problem and that's what all this
[1:28:59.080 --> 1:29:03.000]  climate stuff is about and we're going to be talking to craig richardson later in the program
[1:29:03.000 --> 1:29:07.160]  uh from any legal we're going to talk about the paris climate treaty which they don't want to let
[1:29:07.160 --> 1:29:12.600]  go of certain factions within the white house but it has economic issues it is at the heart of
[1:29:12.600 --> 1:29:17.720]  globalism versus nationalism and and that's what's so disturbing about this to see this being
[1:29:17.720 --> 1:29:24.200]  subordinated in the service of the neoconservatives the warmonger wing that has been brought into
[1:29:24.200 --> 1:29:29.160]  the white house that's what i'm so concerned about well we we're out of time thank you so much for
[1:29:29.160 --> 1:29:36.360]  right and again we see yes go ahead go ahead we well we got we we see we see the hand of the council
[1:29:36.360 --> 1:29:40.760]  on foreign relations he's brought too many of those people into his administration and now
[1:29:40.760 --> 1:29:47.560]  they are starting to sing his praises in the cfr journals and on their website yes yes exactly

[1:33:18.200 --> 1:33:26.760]  welcome back to the alex joneshow i'm david night and we're going to be joined by
[1:33:26.760 --> 1:33:30.280]  dr group here in a moment there's a lot of uh health stories that have come out in the last
[1:33:30.280 --> 1:33:36.520]  couple of days we had a story on info wars dot com from robert f kennedy jr talking about a
[1:33:36.520 --> 1:33:43.960]  recent study that showed that infants with deep tp vaccine had five to ten times uh higher death rate
[1:33:43.960 --> 1:33:48.520]  rate perhaps that had something to do with lowering the immune system but that was a study that was
[1:33:48.520 --> 1:33:56.520]  done in uh africa it was um looking for the country here um i'm not sure which country this was but
[1:33:56.520 --> 1:34:01.080]  it was a study that was funded by the danish government and as robert kennedy points out
[1:34:01.080 --> 1:34:05.880]  robert kennedy jr he says we can't get these studies from the american government they don't
[1:34:05.880 --> 1:34:12.440]  want to look at the effect of vaccines and yet when you do a study in a foreign country
[1:34:12.440 --> 1:34:18.920]  and you see that uh there's a five to ten times greater mortality rate uh of the kids who are
[1:34:18.920 --> 1:34:23.400]  vaccinated with this diphtheria tetanus and pertussis vaccine than there was with the kids who
[1:34:23.400 --> 1:34:29.720]  didn't get it it tells you that maybe there's something going on this is in uh guinea uh in
[1:34:29.720 --> 1:34:35.640]  west africa this is where they did the study uh also we have a story that's up today about a
[1:34:35.640 --> 1:34:43.320]  blood thinning drug uh xarelto if i'm pronouncing that correctly faces 18 000 lawsuits but we're
[1:34:43.320 --> 1:34:46.920]  going to talk about things that have to do with nutrition as well and before i get to dr group
[1:34:46.920 --> 1:34:52.040]  i just want to remind you that we've extended this sale on caveman our true paleo formulation

[1:35:15.240 --> 1:35:19.560]  the benefits of those types of ingredients and it's something that you can take very easily
[1:35:19.560 --> 1:35:24.840]  in a drink mix and i've got a review here of the day about caveman from mojo ryzen
[1:35:24.840 --> 1:35:29.560]  in ohio he says uh i will buy this product again and again he says i use milk when i have caveman
[1:35:29.560 --> 1:35:34.920]  tastes like a milkshake i use this product after my workouts just ordered another two pack great
[1:35:34.920 --> 1:35:41.880]  product caveman and actually um my son has the same comments he's using it with his workouts

[1:36:19.560 --> 1:36:26.760]  to dr group welcome dr group thanks david thanks for having me on and uh you know as far as out all
[1:36:26.760 --> 1:36:31.560]  the stuff that's happening in the world right now everybody you know there's studies coming out that
[1:36:31.560 --> 1:36:37.640]  everybody's under extreme amounts of stress everybody is depressed and all that leads to the
[1:36:37.640 --> 1:36:43.560]  majority of the time is people on more pharmaceuticals which we're trying to get away from and one of
[1:36:43.560 --> 1:36:48.360]  the reasons i wanted to come on today is to talk about the obesity endemic and to talk about fat
[1:36:48.360 --> 1:36:53.480]  and and what's happening we've been talking and letting people know for a long time that there's
[1:36:53.480 --> 1:36:58.040]  two organs in the body that are really responsible for the body running efficiently and that's the
[1:36:58.040 --> 1:37:04.520]  gut which we talk so much about heal the gut heal the brain heal the body the gut mind connection
[1:37:04.520 --> 1:37:10.920]  the immune system connection from the gut and how important it is not only to put good foods and good
[1:37:10.920 --> 1:37:16.680]  beverages water in your system but also to keep your gut healthy and clean on a regular basis
[1:37:16.680 --> 1:37:21.000]  what we're finding out now though and this is something that is not new but we're seeing more
[1:37:21.000 --> 1:37:27.240]  scientific evidence come out is the effects that all of these chemicals and toxins are having on
[1:37:27.240 --> 1:37:33.320]  the liver and that's why liver shield is on is on sale today for 30 off because for example there's
[1:37:33.320 --> 1:37:38.840]  a couple uh studies that just came out one of them is that high fructose diet during pregnancy
[1:37:38.840 --> 1:37:43.640]  and you look at the high fructose corn syrup which is practically in everything these days
[1:37:43.640 --> 1:37:51.960]  can actually cause the children if the mother consumes high fructose corn syrup during pregnancy
[1:37:51.960 --> 1:37:57.880]  the children are now susceptible to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease this is one of the conditions
[1:37:57.880 --> 1:38:03.640]  that's being really really suppressed you know a long time ago was we had a big rise and we still
[1:38:03.640 --> 1:38:10.360]  have a big rise in alcoholic fatty liver disease but now we're seeing non-alcoholic fatty disease
[1:38:10.360 --> 1:38:17.080]  and we're seeing obesity in general as an epidemic you look at 95 percent of the population in the
[1:38:17.080 --> 1:38:25.640]  united states is overweight by five pounds 10 pounds 15 pounds 20 pounds 30 pounds and they're
[1:38:25.640 --> 1:38:30.520]  having a hard time losing weight and and with the hormone disruptions the endocrine disrupting
[1:38:30.520 --> 1:38:37.160]  chemicals the msg the aspartame the all the other artificial sweeteners all the chemicals and toxins
[1:38:37.160 --> 1:38:44.920]  glyphosate that's in the food supply all of these things just alter the body and can continue with
[1:38:44.920 --> 1:38:53.000]  fat accumulation and what happens is the liver is becoming toxic and we've been evaluating
[1:38:53.000 --> 1:38:58.040]  liver disease and what's going on with the liver the medical profession really doesn't have
[1:38:58.920 --> 1:39:05.880]  set guidelines or ways to determine how toxic your liver is how fibrotic your liver is how many
[1:39:05.880 --> 1:39:12.760]  stones you have in your liver non-alcoholic fatty liver disease fatty liver disease and even tests
[1:39:12.760 --> 1:39:19.560]  show that males who drink one to two ounces of alcohol a night females is even lower females
[1:39:19.560 --> 1:39:27.000]  that drink one up to one ounce of alcohol a night have tremendous increased risk of fatty
[1:39:27.000 --> 1:39:32.040]  liver disease so what is fatty liver disease fatty liver disease is when you have fat accumulation
[1:39:32.040 --> 1:39:37.880]  in your liver the liver is not able to function properly and my message to everybody today is
[1:39:38.520 --> 1:39:46.120]  the good news is your liver regenerates itself very fast you get a new liver every three months
[1:39:46.840 --> 1:39:53.240]  the liver has 500 different functions it performs it neutralizes all your toxins it fights off
[1:39:53.240 --> 1:39:58.280]  infection it protects your immune system it controls blood sugar it's the only organ that
[1:39:58.280 --> 1:40:02.760]  can regenerate itself really fast besides the skin and the intestines which you get new cells
[1:40:02.760 --> 1:40:08.440]  every 24 hours but when you clog the filter because the liver filters about one and a half
[1:40:08.440 --> 1:40:15.080]  quarts of blood a minute it removes toxins air pollutants pesticides all the environmental
[1:40:15.080 --> 1:40:21.240]  chemicals all the chemicals in food what we're seeing is that most people's livers right now
[1:40:21.240 --> 1:40:25.160]  especially over the age of 30 but we're also seeing it in children because you're seeing
[1:40:25.160 --> 1:40:32.120]  obesity in children is that most people's livers are only functioning 40 to 50 percent
[1:40:32.120 --> 1:40:39.000]  in order for you to be healthy your liver has to be above the 80 percent functionality so it's
[1:40:39.000 --> 1:40:45.720]  super important to give all the listeners the information of how important it is to continue
[1:40:46.440 --> 1:40:52.280]  cleansing your liver and to do liver cleanses on a regular basis ultimately it's about addressing
[1:40:52.280 --> 1:40:56.200]  the root cause of the problem you know the root cause of the problem is what we're exposed to
[1:40:56.200 --> 1:41:01.240]  in our environment every single day and that comes from the air we breathe and it comes from the
[1:41:01.240 --> 1:41:06.840]  food we eat and comes from the beverages that we drink but you know it's hard to get away from
[1:41:06.840 --> 1:41:12.520]  those things and if you can't eat organic all the time and you can't drink water all the time
[1:41:12.520 --> 1:41:19.720]  the next best thing regardless is to keep your liver healthy and you know to fight the globalist
[1:41:19.720 --> 1:41:28.440]  to look at what the attack is that we're under and how important it actually is to clean and keep
[1:41:28.440 --> 1:41:34.600]  your liver healthy and supportive because that is your main system you know it's kind of interesting
[1:41:34.600 --> 1:41:39.480]  doctor group there was a story yesterday from the Daily Mail talking about something like yogurt
[1:41:39.480 --> 1:41:42.680]  many people look at it and say hey that's it's going to be really great for me and yet if you
[1:41:42.680 --> 1:41:49.320]  look at what the manufactured yogurt has they said that there's more yogurt sugar in your yogurt
[1:41:49.320 --> 1:41:55.240]  than in many desserts they say it's merely dessert and disguise in many cases and this goes back they
[1:41:55.240 --> 1:42:01.640]  said nearly half of 200 yogurts analyzed had more than three teaspoons of sugar per 100 grams this
[1:42:01.640 --> 1:42:06.040]  is a big part of Michelle's school lunch program and when they were going back and looking at it
[1:42:06.040 --> 1:42:10.440]  they said hey you know these these yogurts including Chobani Greek yogurt they had as much sugar as a
[1:42:10.440 --> 1:42:15.160]  candy bar they just didn't taste as good you know so it's like you know you'd rather have a candy bar
[1:42:15.160 --> 1:42:19.640]  you'd rather have it going to get the same amount of sugar they sometimes call it sugar cane juice
[1:42:19.640 --> 1:42:24.600]  instead of calling it sugar they'll do anything to relabel it you know call it high fructose
[1:42:24.600 --> 1:42:30.200]  or call it cane juice or something like that so they're very deceptive about the way they add sugar
[1:42:30.200 --> 1:42:36.280]  into even things that start out healthy like yogurt most of the food supply out there that's
[1:42:36.280 --> 1:42:43.000]  not certified organic has hidden ingredients in it natural flavors for example sounds really really
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:50.200]  good but it's actually another hidden name for MSG all of you know when you look at let's say yogurt
[1:42:50.200 --> 1:42:55.960]  for example like you said well you have to look at everything first of all they're culturing dairy
[1:42:55.960 --> 1:43:01.640]  dairy is an allergen in most people it causes an inflammatory reaction it causes an immune response
[1:43:02.200 --> 1:43:08.360]  then you look at was that dairy what was that cow fed and most likely 90% of the cows out there
[1:43:08.360 --> 1:43:13.480]  felt genetically modified grains so now you have genetically modified particles that are
[1:43:13.480 --> 1:43:18.600]  probably in there the cows are heavily vaccinated the cows are heavily dosed on antibiotics so you
[1:43:18.600 --> 1:43:23.560]  have drug residue in there as well and then you have bovine growth hormone in there so it's not
[1:43:23.560 --> 1:43:29.960]  just what's on the label if you were to analyze most of the yogurts and not only yogurts most of
[1:43:29.960 --> 1:43:36.280]  the boxed canned processed microwaved foods out there you would have a whole slew of chemical
[1:43:36.280 --> 1:43:41.640]  pesticide residue genetically modified ingredients you would have hormones in there you would have
[1:43:41.640 --> 1:43:46.520]  endocrine disrupting chemicals in there you would have all kinds of things in there and that's
[1:43:46.520 --> 1:43:53.800]  really what the concern is yes organic is better always and you know that's or you growing your
[1:43:53.800 --> 1:43:58.120]  own food would even be better than that yeah you know you're talking about the GMO content again
[1:43:58.120 --> 1:44:02.600]  that was one of the other things that came up with yogurt I've been looking into this since
[1:44:02.600 --> 1:44:07.240]  Chobani decided they would sue us for talking about their crony capitalism and they had a back
[1:44:07.240 --> 1:44:14.520]  and forth with Humdy Ulacaya about the fact that they the dairy products that they use came from
[1:44:14.520 --> 1:44:20.440]  cows that were fed GMO food corn and other things and they said well we just don't think that it's
[1:44:20.440 --> 1:44:26.680]  worth it to make the product more expensive we want a lot of people to be able to have our product
[1:44:26.680 --> 1:44:31.000]  because they want big sales so we're going to do that but what happens is that the government
[1:44:31.000 --> 1:44:38.040]  comes in with them and says that it's non GMO because it's just the food that the dairy cattle
[1:44:38.040 --> 1:44:44.520]  are eating that's GMO but the dairy is then not considered to be not labeled as GMO so they
[1:44:44.520 --> 1:44:50.920]  cooperate with them and that deception on the labeling yeah it's just really sad and that's
[1:44:50.920 --> 1:44:55.800]  that's why we're here to try to educate everybody and all the listeners and info warriors out there
[1:44:55.800 --> 1:45:01.560]  that know the truth and that we continue to report the truth and report the studies that the mainstream
[1:45:01.560 --> 1:45:06.920]  media is not going to report because it's all about getting the truth and getting the right answers
[1:45:06.920 --> 1:45:11.560]  another study that's interesting that I wanted to mention today was that out not only does alcohol
[1:45:11.560 --> 1:45:18.440]  damage the liver but now they've found that once you know people that consume alcohol on a regular
[1:45:18.440 --> 1:45:26.600]  basis it actually damages the gut and allows gut bacteria to migrate to the liver promoting alcohol
[1:45:26.600 --> 1:45:32.040]  induced liver disease and you can actually get bad bacteria in your liver as well so that's another
[1:45:32.040 --> 1:45:36.520]  study I wanted to talk about today and just you know let everybody know I know we're going to
[1:45:36.520 --> 1:45:42.600]  be taking some calls because everybody loves to have their health questions answered but liver
[1:45:42.600 --> 1:45:48.040]  disease and the sad thing about it is most people don't even know they have it until it's too late
[1:45:48.040 --> 1:45:54.600]  I would say probably the the the general population especially in the United States has a malfunctioning
[1:45:54.600 --> 1:46:00.680]  liver and once you heal the gut once you heal the liver once you're on good supplementation
[1:46:00.680 --> 1:46:06.440]  like iodine once you let me give out the phone number so we can get some people to call in with
[1:46:06.440 --> 1:46:13.880]  their questions you want to take questions that number is 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 if you want
[1:46:13.880 --> 1:46:19.000]  to call in with a health question to Dr. Group go ahead now and another thing you know when you talk
[1:46:19.000 --> 1:46:23.320]  about fad there's so many people saying well what do I do about it how do I get rid of all the fat
[1:46:23.320 --> 1:46:28.680]  in my liver how do I get rid of the fat in my body I've now spent about the last 12 months doing
[1:46:28.680 --> 1:46:35.800]  in-depth research on fasting because if you look at years and years ago in all biblical texts and
[1:46:35.800 --> 1:46:41.240]  all ancient texts the only thing they had was really fasting and when people got sick they would go
[1:46:41.240 --> 1:46:46.520]  to the local spring with the waterfall with the high oxygen in the water and they would soak in
[1:46:46.520 --> 1:46:51.240]  that and all they would do is drink water so if you think about the self-healing mechanism that
[1:46:51.240 --> 1:46:57.480]  we're all born with and how powerful it is you know we're our self-healing mechanism is being
[1:46:57.480 --> 1:47:02.200]  suppressed because we're taking in all of these chemicals and all these toxins on a daily basis
[1:47:02.200 --> 1:47:07.080]  and we're not able to get rid of these toxins on a daily basis and I'm going to be publishing my
[1:47:07.080 --> 1:47:12.200]  next book on the benefits of fasting and what's going on with fasting it's kind of taking hold
[1:47:12.200 --> 1:47:20.040]  right now with the ketogenic diet and and being able for the body to go back in time and literally
[1:47:20.040 --> 1:47:25.160]  melt fat and attack fat in in your system there was an interesting study that was just that just
[1:47:25.160 --> 1:47:33.960]  came out from a USC they had mice do 72 hour water fast which all they did was drink water for 72
[1:47:33.960 --> 1:47:41.480]  hours and it flipped a regenerative switch which prompted stem cells to create new white blood
[1:47:41.480 --> 1:47:48.600]  cells essentially regenerating the entire immune system it's amazing the doctors from the late 1800s
[1:47:48.600 --> 1:47:54.920]  so the 1940s that were doing fasting the the benefits and the regeneration of the body that
[1:47:54.920 --> 1:47:59.800]  was taking place so that's something that people should look into also if they're looking to lose
[1:47:59.800 --> 1:48:05.480]  a lot of weight or to detoxify themselves and that's why we're such a big proponent of detoxification
[1:48:05.480 --> 1:48:10.680]  detoxification not not putting and exposing yourself to the chemicals and toxins but getting
[1:48:10.680 --> 1:48:15.720]  them out of your body as fast as you can that's amazing let's let's go to one of our phone calls
[1:48:15.720 --> 1:48:24.440]  here Thomas in Texas go ahead Thomas hi David nice thanks for taking my call sure go ahead um I did
[1:48:24.440 --> 1:48:29.400]  I did the um I did the liver cleanse the first um well the first time it came out right right
[1:48:29.400 --> 1:48:35.320]  up y'all started and it really helped a lot I felt better I actually lost nine pounds in about six
[1:48:35.320 --> 1:48:41.240]  days the liver cleanse I think the six days and after that I lost nine pounds um I'm looking to do
[1:48:41.240 --> 1:48:46.840]  it again and my question is could I substitute at the end you take six ounces of olive oil
[1:48:46.840 --> 1:48:52.600]  could I substitute that with coconut oil would you uh say no to that now I would say no to that
[1:48:52.600 --> 1:48:57.480]  just because there hasn't been a lot of research done on that it's just the way that the olive
[1:48:57.480 --> 1:49:03.320]  oil is it really causes a purging of the of the gallbladder and the liver and that's what's
[1:49:03.320 --> 1:49:09.400]  really been used for over a hundred years actually they found olive oil and and that olive oil was
[1:49:09.400 --> 1:49:16.440]  being used to cleanse the liver you know probably 500 years ago so I would uh continue with that I
[1:49:16.440 --> 1:49:22.600]  just maybe it would have some sort of effect but it hasn't been used we've we've studied over five
[1:49:22.600 --> 1:49:28.280]  we've had people do over 500 000 liver cleanses probably more than that through infowars life
[1:49:28.280 --> 1:49:33.320]  and through a global healing center and we've modified those over a long period of time but
[1:49:34.520 --> 1:49:39.160]  even if you're not going to do the full liver cleanse which I think everybody should do at
[1:49:39.160 --> 1:49:45.800]  least three times a year because what we found is one liver cleanse really only cleanses the liver
[1:49:45.800 --> 1:49:50.680]  about 15 percent so let's say that you know you're having symptoms you're sluggish you're out of
[1:49:50.680 --> 1:49:56.600]  energy you want to clean your liver and the and also you mentioned a good point there when your body
[1:49:57.240 --> 1:50:02.360]  starts storing fat it's your liver that's congested with weight gain most people never
[1:50:02.360 --> 1:50:06.520]  address the liver when you talk about losing weight but the liver is what breaks down and
[1:50:06.520 --> 1:50:12.840]  processes your fat stores so by doing liver cleansing you actually accelerate weight loss
[1:50:12.840 --> 1:50:20.120]  in the body so a good question but that's why I personally take the liver shield just by itself
[1:50:20.120 --> 1:50:24.520]  I do three to four liver cleanses I'm in the middle of a four-day water fast as a matter of fact
[1:50:24.520 --> 1:50:31.400]  today is day four for me I've had nothing but water for four days and I'm charting my progress
[1:50:31.400 --> 1:50:35.800]  and seeing what happens because obviously I don't want to tell people to do stuff if I haven't done
[1:50:35.800 --> 1:50:41.720]  it myself but I take the liver shield on a regular basis just as maintenance I mean just a couple
[1:50:41.720 --> 1:50:47.480]  dropperfuls a couple times a week and I make a tea with it actually I use a lot of the supplements
[1:50:47.480 --> 1:50:52.280]  and make tea with them and they're great to just mix in and put in a hang on right there doctor
[1:50:52.280 --> 1:50:55.800]  dude we're gonna put hot water in there we gotta take a quick break we're gonna be right back and

[1:54:11.720 --> 1:54:15.880]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show i'm david and we're talking to dr group and he's actually
[1:54:15.880 --> 1:54:20.920]  taking your calls and questions i want to get to these right away because we've got one more
[1:54:20.920 --> 1:54:24.760]  section with you then at the top of the hour we'll have another section another segment
[1:54:24.760 --> 1:54:31.960]  let's go to don in seattle don go ahead you know another question i've been having problems and
[1:54:33.000 --> 1:54:40.600]  actually the tongue getting coated with yellow i've got the uh super blue itself uh i can actually
[1:54:40.600 --> 1:54:46.440]  go almost the whole day now without getting a tongue coating and i'm just wondering what
[1:54:46.440 --> 1:54:53.480]  what you know uh might cause that or uh i've got a little bit of liver shield i've been doing it in
[1:54:53.480 --> 1:54:59.000]  the mornings and it has helped it has actually helped and the super blue has definitely helped
[1:54:59.000 --> 1:55:06.920]  it's helped keep my mouth fresh but uh it's got me a little concerned i you know i don't know what
[1:55:06.920 --> 1:55:12.200]  could be causing that there could be a lot of different things i'm not actually sure if usually
[1:55:12.200 --> 1:55:18.360]  when you get a coating on the tongue it's white and then other different compounds can stain that
[1:55:18.920 --> 1:55:25.400]  and that could be because of a candida or a yeast overgrowth in the body i would have to
[1:55:25.400 --> 1:55:30.440]  really get more in depth about your diet and what you're doing uh with that although the
[1:55:30.440 --> 1:55:37.400]  super blue does have iodine in there as well so that also might be a cause so you might want to just
[1:55:37.400 --> 1:55:43.400]  stop doing that maybe for a few days and just see if it turns white and if it turns white then you
[1:55:43.400 --> 1:55:48.520]  might want to you know look at what you're doing in your diet you i don't know if you're consuming
[1:55:48.520 --> 1:55:54.360]  a lot of excess sugar alcohol stuff like that but you might need to go ahead and do a harmful
[1:55:54.360 --> 1:56:00.440]  organism cleanse and maybe purge yourself of you know yeast and fungus and mold or something like
[1:56:00.440 --> 1:56:05.160]  that which is you know a huge problem these days that people are also dealing with and that's why
[1:56:05.160 --> 1:56:12.360]  we just recently launched the myco zx on info wars it's sold out right now but you know it's
[1:56:13.720 --> 1:56:18.920]  cleaning your body and detoxifying your body from everything and you might also want to look at doing
[1:56:18.920 --> 1:56:23.880]  you know your gut health as well and getting your gut you know fixed up cleansing with the oxy
[1:56:23.880 --> 1:56:29.640]  powder using a good the good probiotic the biome defense and also maybe doing a liver cleanse as
[1:56:29.640 --> 1:56:35.880]  well all right let's go to uh kyle in michigan kyle go ahead with your question for dr group uh
[1:56:35.880 --> 1:56:40.040]  first off i'd like to thank you guys for putting out brain force it's uh helped me a lot with my
[1:56:40.040 --> 1:56:45.240]  PTSD and anxiety it's just getting uh giving a lot of clarity in my mind but i got two questions for
[1:56:45.240 --> 1:56:51.240]  you uh the first one is uh how do heirloom seeds help in creating a homegrown diet compared to
[1:56:51.240 --> 1:56:57.400]  normal store-bought seeds and uh how do energy drinks affect our gut and is info wars ever thinking
[1:56:57.400 --> 1:57:04.360]  of creating a uh energy drink that we could use to fuel our body and mind so energy drinks are
[1:57:04.920 --> 1:57:08.280]  there's so many different kinds out there and there's so many different ingredients and you
[1:57:08.280 --> 1:57:14.200]  really have to they're all there is even organic energy drinks but you have to go back to the basics
[1:57:14.200 --> 1:57:22.760]  and say what does the body want on a daily basis what does the body need on a daily basis the body
[1:57:22.760 --> 1:57:28.520]  needs water okay that's just the way it is we're 80 to 90 water every living substance the earth
[1:57:28.520 --> 1:57:35.000]  itself everything that's alive plants is 80 water without water we shut down and part of the whole
[1:57:35.560 --> 1:57:42.440]  situation we're dealing with now worldwide is the poisoning of the water if you look at all the
[1:57:42.440 --> 1:57:47.560]  chemicals and all the toxins that are being sprayed on us and all the the population control and
[1:57:47.560 --> 1:57:53.480]  everything that's going on it's all contaminating the water because they know if they contaminate the
[1:57:53.480 --> 1:58:00.760]  water then everything will die or everything will be sick so even the stuff the chemtrails everything
[1:58:00.760 --> 1:58:06.840]  they're spraying in the air the air itself actually is composed of water if you think about it so
[1:58:06.840 --> 1:58:11.640]  energy drinks i would say there is no such thing as a good energy drink of course anything in
[1:58:11.640 --> 1:58:18.760]  moderation okay i've always said you know the 90 10 rule or the 95 5 rule you eat healthy 95 percent
[1:58:18.760 --> 1:58:21.880]  of the time and then you always going to be in a situation where you're going to go eat at a
[1:58:21.880 --> 1:58:25.480]  restaurant or you're going to have an energy drink or you're going to have some wine or whatever
[1:58:26.040 --> 1:58:32.680]  the body is is real adaptive it that won't hurt you if you if you use the 90 10 or the 95 5 all
[1:58:32.680 --> 1:58:36.760]  right we got to take a break here thank you cowl we're going to be right back after the top of

[2:01:04.680 --> 2:01:09.640]  yeah hi dr group first i wanted to thank you for all the great products and i know it's a lot of
[2:01:09.640 --> 2:01:17.960]  work and and your service and everything um i got two quick questions for you uh one is i was
[2:01:17.960 --> 2:01:23.480]  diagnosed with fatty liver a couple years ago i did a liver cleanse and i've been taking the liver
[2:01:23.480 --> 2:01:30.520]  shield and i understood from my doctor and what you just said that the liver does regenerate
[2:01:30.520 --> 2:01:37.560]  i was wondering if you could kind of give give me an idea is will it regenerate it and like what
[2:01:37.560 --> 2:01:46.280]  would be the best course of action for that um yeah so okay that was your first question the good
[2:01:46.280 --> 2:01:52.920]  news is that you're actually doing something about it and and i wish that more and more people would
[2:01:52.920 --> 2:02:00.680]  understand that it's health and healing health conditions does not have to be that hard and
[2:02:00.680 --> 2:02:06.840]  i tell people that came to see me that were completely you know distraught with symptoms
[2:02:06.840 --> 2:02:12.280]  what if i told you it was going to take another 40 years to heal what you what what it took 40
[2:02:12.280 --> 2:02:17.960]  years for you to get and the good news is it doesn't really because the body wants to heal itself
[2:02:17.960 --> 2:02:22.760]  everybody's different though don i i can't really say how long it's going to take you to
[2:02:23.400 --> 2:02:30.200]  regenerate your liver uh i would say that anybody who's been diagnosed with non-alcoholic fatty
[2:02:30.200 --> 2:02:36.920]  liver disease cirrhosis of the liver any type of liver condition that means their liver is only
[2:02:36.920 --> 2:02:43.640]  working at around 20 percent so if each liver cleanse boosts the liver 15 percent one liver
[2:02:43.640 --> 2:02:47.960]  cleanse is only going to take you to 35 percent if you do another liver cleanse that's going to take
[2:02:47.960 --> 2:02:52.520]  you to 50 percent then another liver cleanse is going to take you to 65 percent so you would have
[2:02:52.520 --> 2:02:58.360]  to do multiple multiple liver cleanses we've had people with serious serious conditions
[2:02:58.360 --> 2:03:04.040]  that have done just multiple just kept doing liver cleanses they they do one which takes five days
[2:03:04.040 --> 2:03:09.080]  take a few days off do another one and all of their symptoms have gone away just by healing
[2:03:09.080 --> 2:03:14.760]  the gut and just by healing the liver all right thank you don let's go to jeff in california jeff
[2:03:14.760 --> 2:03:20.600]  your question for dr group hey good morning gentlemen i have a question my my 15 year old son
[2:03:20.600 --> 2:03:25.800]  was never breastfed he's got a bit of a gut and if we eat healthy we use the products amazing
[2:03:25.800 --> 2:03:32.440]  products by the way we purify our water water filter and is is there a connection between
[2:03:34.120 --> 2:03:40.200]  kids that haven't been breastfed and you know problems with the gut the liver and so on and
[2:03:40.200 --> 2:03:47.320]  what what can i do about that well the first thing that i would recommend is there is a
[2:03:47.320 --> 2:03:54.040]  connection actually it depends on if he wasn't breastfed it depends on what type of food he was
[2:03:54.040 --> 2:04:01.080]  fed it also actually goes back to even before the conception on on how healthy you and your wife were
[2:04:01.080 --> 2:04:07.080]  before you conceived because your sperm is going to hold the genetic code and her egg and everything
[2:04:07.080 --> 2:04:12.760]  depending on how toxic those were but you know that's there's nothing you can do about that you
[2:04:12.760 --> 2:04:18.360]  know what you want to focus on now is what you can do to repair the situation so what i would
[2:04:18.360 --> 2:04:23.080]  recommend since he is 15 is going through an intestinal cleanse i don't know if done that
[2:04:23.080 --> 2:04:28.440]  already maybe another liver cleanse cleansing the body of the harmful organisms you know doing a
[2:04:28.440 --> 2:04:33.880]  harmful organism cleanse because a lot of times with childhood obesity or just that weight that's
[2:04:33.880 --> 2:04:40.200]  hard to come off can be due to an underlying fungus or a mold or some sort of an organism
[2:04:40.200 --> 2:04:45.000]  which is in the body so we i've seen that happen and you need to flush those out of the system
[2:04:45.000 --> 2:04:49.080]  all right that's all the time we've got sorry to uh dean james and jeff sorry we couldn't get to you
[2:04:49.080 --> 2:04:53.480]  but that's all the time we have a dr group we have kreg richardson president of environment energy
[2:04:53.480 --> 2:04:58.600]  and environment coming up in the next segment dr group global healing center dot com thank you
[2:05:01.560 --> 2:05:06.520]  trump just signed an executive order to pull the federal government out of k through 12 education
[2:05:06.520 --> 2:05:11.000]  following through on a campaign promise to return school control to state and local officials
[2:05:11.000 --> 2:05:16.120]  titled education federalism executive order it directs education secretary betsy devos to
[2:05:16.120 --> 2:05:21.320]  launch a 300 day review of obama era regulations and guidance for school districts and gives her
[2:05:21.320 --> 2:05:26.040]  the power to modify or repeal measures she deems an overreach by the federal government it was
[2:05:26.040 --> 2:05:31.160]  amazing to hear liberals scream and cry as betsy devos was being confirmed and all i was saying the
[2:05:31.160 --> 2:05:35.800]  entire time was good we need to get rid of the department of education you wonder why your local
[2:05:35.800 --> 2:05:40.120]  schools don't have money to pay teachers or for upkeep it's because that money is being held by
[2:05:40.120 --> 2:05:44.760]  the federal government don't believe me just read the book the deliberate dumbing down of america
[2:05:44.760 --> 2:05:49.480]  by charlotte israeli she was a whistleblower from the department of education in the 1980s
[2:05:49.480 --> 2:05:55.080]  and her tomb describes how the federal education system was designed to create automatons rob

[2:08:25.720 --> 2:08:32.440]  and the two e's there stand for energy and environment they look at uh ways that we can
[2:08:32.440 --> 2:08:37.640]  deregulate energy because you know that is something that not only affects our quality of life but it
[2:08:37.640 --> 2:08:44.760]  also affects our life expectancy energy and cheap access to that is something that is fundamental
[2:08:44.760 --> 2:08:50.440]  to our freedom to our economy kreg has had more than 25 years of experience as a professional
[2:08:50.440 --> 2:08:56.360]  who's been involved in numerous campaigns and other issues that are anti-tax and deregulation
[2:08:56.360 --> 2:09:03.560]  initiatives we've talked before we're both very happy with the person that president trump has put
[2:09:03.560 --> 2:09:09.800]  in at the epa scott pruity somebody who had a long history of fighting regulatory overreach from the
[2:09:09.800 --> 2:09:20.120]  epa but i want to talk to you today kreg about the paris climate treaty and our involvement with that
[2:09:20.120 --> 2:09:25.160]  we've seen that both trump has said he wants to get out of that we've seen scott pruit his epa chief
[2:09:25.160 --> 2:09:30.920]  say he wants to get out of it but there is a push with evanka jared kushner and secretary
[2:09:30.920 --> 2:09:37.080]  state rex tillerson to ride the fence on this to say all right we're going to do some changes at epa
[2:09:37.080 --> 2:09:43.320]  but we're going to not say anything at all about the paris treaty and i guess um as i'm looking at
[2:09:43.320 --> 2:09:47.960]  this it's it's kind of like watching an old movie being replayed you know cast the block with uh
[2:09:47.960 --> 2:09:51.960]  unfree bogart you know we've got we've got a couple of people there in the white house who's saying
[2:09:51.960 --> 2:09:56.840]  we'll always have paris maybe we always will have the paris treaty we never can get rid of it but
[2:09:56.840 --> 2:10:01.720]  because they're certainly trying to bogart it there in the white house for all it's worth uh tell us
[2:10:01.720 --> 2:10:07.720]  why uh this is important what does it mean for the us that we're involved in this because we did
[2:10:07.720 --> 2:10:13.080]  not have the senate ratify this treaty we had obama sign it we had secretary of state at the time
[2:10:13.640 --> 2:10:19.560]  john carrey sign it what does it mean for us moving forward well i first of all appreciate you
[2:10:19.560 --> 2:10:24.600]  having me here on the show um you know i actually use it i'm a huge unfree bogart fan and then
[2:10:24.600 --> 2:10:28.520]  that's one of my favorite movies of all time and you know you also remember in that line
[2:10:28.520 --> 2:10:35.320]  round up all the usual suspects yeah and i think sadly um you know we i was at a meeting the other
[2:10:35.320 --> 2:10:41.000]  day with some right a center of energy environment groups called cooler heads coalition and you know
[2:10:41.000 --> 2:10:46.600]  we were sort of shaking our heads saying i thought our side had won the election um so you know this
[2:10:46.600 --> 2:10:53.160]  is a this is a major frustration uh we have factions that are have formed uh within the white
[2:10:53.160 --> 2:10:56.680]  house itself you identified a few of them as his daughter and his son-in-law to start with
[2:10:56.680 --> 2:11:03.240]  uh but you have rex hillerson who was an exon mobile CEO who also exon mobile had some support
[2:11:03.240 --> 2:11:08.440]  for carbon tax back in the day i think the bottom line with what you have to realize what we're
[2:11:08.440 --> 2:11:12.760]  dealing with which you know we all know in particularly you who who covered the issues you
[2:11:12.760 --> 2:11:19.880]  do is that this is a major international effort and pushed by those global elitists and the
[2:11:19.880 --> 2:11:25.560]  governments that they prop up and support and corporations behind them uh the statistic that
[2:11:25.560 --> 2:11:32.520]  stands out in my mind most is that the climate change industry and it is an industry uh is a
[2:11:32.520 --> 2:11:41.640]  1.5 trillion dollar annual industry and i was asking in paris i was at the cop 21 where the
[2:11:41.640 --> 2:11:46.680]  un folks signed all that we were the anti cop group and my colleague chris warner and others
[2:11:46.680 --> 2:11:52.520]  had wanted posters plastered all over paris when we arrived at the environmentalist which we felt
[2:11:52.520 --> 2:11:58.280]  welcomed um but when i was there and i was inside the pavilion where they had the corporate things
[2:11:58.280 --> 2:12:02.760]  of all the great technologies coming forward that word corporate was really what struck out
[2:12:02.760 --> 2:12:09.400]  to stuck out at me i mean this is a majorly polished movement it's funded in part by big
[2:12:09.400 --> 2:12:15.080]  by the un by big governments like all throughout europe united states there's diplomacy involved
[2:12:15.080 --> 2:12:20.120]  here there's there's uh green money that's flowing through from rock fellowship this is a big deal and
[2:12:20.120 --> 2:12:25.080]  for this is what we're up against in terms of trying to get out of paris because all of those
[2:12:25.080 --> 2:12:29.480]  interests that i just mentioned are all wanting us to stay in you know i have a lot of people
[2:12:29.480 --> 2:12:35.320]  who are with us on this fight against uh of nationalism versus globalism they understand
[2:12:35.320 --> 2:12:40.840]  those issues they understand that carbon taxes are something that's not only going to be a feather
[2:12:40.840 --> 2:12:45.720]  betting and crony capitalism but it's also something that could fund a world government they have to
[2:12:45.720 --> 2:12:52.040]  have some way to fund it so they need a worldwide problem that they can have a worldwide tax to
[2:12:52.040 --> 2:12:55.320]  so they understand the danger of that but they don't understand many of them when we're talking
[2:12:55.320 --> 2:13:01.240]  about my concerns when rex tillerson was even announced that they were thinking about making
[2:13:01.240 --> 2:13:08.200]  him secretary of state i was concerned about his previous stance on uh on all these issues
[2:13:08.200 --> 2:13:11.480]  climate issues carbon issues that sort of thing and a lot of people would say oh but
[2:13:11.480 --> 2:13:15.960]  but he works for an oil company he's not going to want to restrict oil and it's like no no no
[2:13:15.960 --> 2:13:20.600]  you don't understand i mean the beers want some monopoly on diamonds so they don't necessarily
[2:13:20.600 --> 2:13:25.160]  want to pump out lots of diamonds they want to pump out a few diamonds and have them be
[2:13:25.160 --> 2:13:30.520]  very very expensive that's where these oil companies are coming from the oil companies are on the side
[2:13:30.520 --> 2:13:37.400]  of the un and these climate change uh crony capitalists yeah we actually saw recently that
[2:13:37.400 --> 2:13:43.480]  shell was paying it's the top executives bonuses for their sustainability lifestyles so this is
[2:13:43.480 --> 2:13:48.520]  pervasive throughout the corporations what i would call the multi or not alive the multinational
[2:13:48.520 --> 2:13:52.440]  corporations and you know we're seeing that across america the corporatization of america
[2:13:52.440 --> 2:13:57.640]  their rep and their their uh spinning up all these industries and these large international
[2:13:57.640 --> 2:14:01.560]  corporations have big stakes in this they're overseas already in all of this they're doing
[2:14:01.560 --> 2:14:07.080]  all this there's portfolios within these um exxon mobiles of the world that are that are already
[2:14:07.080 --> 2:14:12.120]  big in the renewables so yeah and to think the old days where you know corporate america business
[2:14:12.120 --> 2:14:15.880]  was on one side and the government was on the other is that's long gone i mean they're basically
[2:14:15.880 --> 2:14:20.120]  as far as i'm concerned they're two sides the same coin yeah absolutely and let's talk about
[2:14:20.120 --> 2:14:24.680]  the renewable energy mandates as well because uh when we look at uh some of the positive talk
[2:14:24.680 --> 2:14:28.760]  about some of the positive moves that have happened at the epa under scott pruit but then
[2:14:28.760 --> 2:14:33.560]  also we understand that there are a lot of states what is it about half of the states that have
[2:14:33.560 --> 2:14:38.040]  a renewable energy mandates that are going to come in so as we see some of these regulations
[2:14:38.600 --> 2:14:43.560]  to put coal out of business we also understand that there's all these renewable energy mandates
[2:14:43.560 --> 2:14:48.440]  that are out there as well yeah i think the not surprisingly the the tip of the spear and this
[2:14:48.440 --> 2:14:53.320]  is california which thinks somehow it's going to go 100 renewable by 2050 which is not that far
[2:14:53.320 --> 2:14:58.120]  down the road um i don't know how you're going to want run la and san francisco and wind and solar
[2:14:58.120 --> 2:15:02.920]  but somehow that some how they do yeah but to answer your question you got 30 states across
[2:15:02.920 --> 2:15:07.480]  the country that have these renewable energy standards some there generally was a model
[2:15:07.480 --> 2:15:11.560]  legislation pushed through by the environmental groups across the board when everybody was asleep
[2:15:11.560 --> 2:15:19.080]  basically um we actually sued the state of colorado um on this very issue uh under the
[2:15:19.080 --> 2:15:23.160]  dormant commerce clause in terms of international interstate commerce saying that you can't have
[2:15:23.160 --> 2:15:27.640]  one set of rules for an inter interstate grid you can't have one rule one state one and not
[2:15:27.640 --> 2:15:33.880]  another we lost that state in that circuit but the similar suit was filed i believe it was in
[2:15:33.880 --> 2:15:38.600]  minnesota a different district federal district and and that went the right way and so we actually
[2:15:38.600 --> 2:15:43.400]  thought the supreme court was going to take that up but they never did but but though those are
[2:15:43.400 --> 2:15:48.760]  lying in weight i mean i think and i and i don't want to be you know thinking that this would
[2:15:48.760 --> 2:15:52.120]  have been better certainly if the election was the other way you know don't don't get me wrong
[2:15:52.120 --> 2:15:56.120]  that's what i wake up every day and thank the good lord that you know we have a fighting chance
[2:15:56.120 --> 2:16:02.280]  because of uh trump but i don't also think from a for a minute that every one of these battles
[2:16:02.280 --> 2:16:07.000]  is anywhere near being over uh and and we're seeing it even with a republican house or
[2:16:07.000 --> 2:16:12.120]  republican senate and a republican administration where we can't get even the basic things like a
[2:16:12.120 --> 2:16:16.600]  campaign promise to get out of a treaty in in paris i mean the things that should be slam
[2:16:16.600 --> 2:16:21.080]  dunks or not and that's key too let's let's go back to that because uh chris warner who
[2:16:21.080 --> 2:16:26.600]  is a senior legal fellow at the energy environment legal institute where you are he said this about
[2:16:26.600 --> 2:16:30.520]  the paris agreement as to why it matters he said the paris agreement pressure machine
[2:16:31.080 --> 2:16:36.520]  will trigger blowback every time the president or congress or future administrations deviate
[2:16:36.520 --> 2:16:42.440]  from obama's emission reduction promises or hesitate to subsidize green energy ventures
[2:16:42.440 --> 2:16:49.560]  abroad or fails to adopt more stringent targets so every time we try to stop the environmentalists
[2:16:49.560 --> 2:16:54.840]  from taking down an entire industry in order to reward a different industry uh every time
[2:16:54.840 --> 2:16:58.120]  that happens they're going to go back to the climate uh treaty they're also going to go back
[2:16:58.120 --> 2:17:03.400]  to the endangerment clause so even though we can have a regulatory regime right now that's
[2:17:03.400 --> 2:17:06.920]  going to come in and say we're going to get rid of these regulations if you leave the foundation
[2:17:06.920 --> 2:17:11.160]  there then they're going to continue to go back to that and the courts will go back to it as well
[2:17:11.160 --> 2:17:15.000]  as long as that is there it won't they exactly and i and i think that i was going to mention
[2:17:15.000 --> 2:17:17.880]  the danger in finding i mean you're right on the money there too that's the one that
[2:17:17.880 --> 2:17:23.240]  that's the underlying issue that epa came up with or manufactured that allows all of them to
[2:17:23.240 --> 2:17:27.080]  to regulate greenhouse gas and everything else in the clean power plant yeah it's a little like
[2:17:27.080 --> 2:17:31.320]  a zombie or franka sign i mean you can do these things will be asleep maybe for four years or
[2:17:31.320 --> 2:17:35.160]  eight years whatever it's going to be but you can certainly start them up again um and if you don't
[2:17:35.160 --> 2:17:39.640]  do anything at all which is some of the some people are advocating then you're right that's
[2:17:39.640 --> 2:17:45.320]  going to be precedent that's there just because he signed an executive order saying that you know
[2:17:45.320 --> 2:17:51.000]  the the clean power plant should be remit remanded back to the epa that the epa because it's on the
[2:17:51.000 --> 2:17:55.480]  books now has to come up with something they have to do something uh and the other problem you have
[2:17:55.480 --> 2:18:01.560]  is is um trump's having a very difficult time getting all his lower level people in um underneath
[2:18:01.560 --> 2:18:06.120]  and you have essentially have career bureaucrats that you know are not on the same page and oh
[2:18:06.120 --> 2:18:10.440]  absolutely yeah absolutely you know it's interesting we're talking about these renewable mandates at
[2:18:10.440 --> 2:18:15.160]  the state level one of the reasons why a lot of people say but i like solar energy and i like
[2:18:15.160 --> 2:18:20.440]  solar energy on individual basis as well if you're not on the grid but if you put out a massive power
[2:18:20.440 --> 2:18:26.360]  station that is on the grid you have to be able to deliver rock solid steady state power and these
[2:18:26.360 --> 2:18:32.440]  renewable sources can't do that without massive massive storage of energy you can store the energy
[2:18:32.440 --> 2:18:37.960]  to to take out of those uh ups and downs on an individual basis you can spend a lot of money
[2:18:37.960 --> 2:18:42.360]  on batteries and it's very expensive do that you can't do that on the grid level and so what they
[2:18:42.360 --> 2:18:48.360]  wind up doing is going back to these other forms of energy whether it's coal or oil they fall back
[2:18:48.360 --> 2:18:54.040]  on these plants and then they're recycling these plants up and down and utilizing them in a much
[2:18:54.040 --> 2:18:59.560]  less efficient way they use more fuel they create more emissions because just like your car if you're
[2:18:59.560 --> 2:19:04.200]  stopping and starting at traffic lights you're going to be using a lot more fuel so it's a lot
[2:19:04.200 --> 2:19:08.360]  less efficient to do that i think that's uh something that a lot of people really don't
[2:19:08.360 --> 2:19:13.720]  understand me we want to see some of these other alternatives uh work but it just simply doesn't
[2:19:13.720 --> 2:19:17.960]  matter and even if you try to make it larger they did that in North Sea they tried to get a larger
[2:19:17.960 --> 2:19:23.000]  uh wind field and they went all up and down the coast of Ireland all it did was make the peaks and
[2:19:23.000 --> 2:19:27.640]  the troughs deeper and higher uh so they couldn't get a steady state out of that renewable that's
[2:19:27.640 --> 2:19:32.040]  the key thing if you're going to have a power grid is that you need to have it renewable i mean
[2:19:32.040 --> 2:19:38.280]  uh stable rather exactly that you hit that's a big issue with as reliability and and grid
[2:19:38.280 --> 2:19:44.440]  consistency uh and you can you exactly you can't get those out of renewables uh again and by renewables
[2:19:44.440 --> 2:19:48.840]  we're talking primarily wind and solar they don't even count for some reason i don't know and i
[2:19:48.840 --> 2:19:53.960]  grew up in New England which would drive heavily on stay with us uh thank you kreg we're gonna have

[2:24:13.080 --> 2:24:18.680]  talking to Craig Richardson with any legal org that's energy and environment issues we're going
[2:24:18.680 --> 2:24:24.040]  to talk to him a little bit more about the importance of getting out of the Paris climate
[2:24:24.040 --> 2:24:28.200]  treaty and of course there's opposition from Jared and Ivanka and Rex Tillerson to that
[2:24:28.760 --> 2:24:35.080]  Donald Trump has advocated getting out of that as well as his pick for EPA Scott Pruitt so we're
[2:24:35.080 --> 2:24:40.120]  hoping that we can win this debate it's a war over the hearts and minds there and the White House
[2:24:40.120 --> 2:24:45.080]  and any legal is a big part of that before we get back to Craig I just want to remind you that we

[2:25:28.760 --> 2:25:34.840]  shield. Craig we're talking about this one of the things that Chris Horner had pointed out
[2:25:34.840 --> 2:25:41.960]  about on your site is that this back and forth that we see between the forces with Jared and
[2:25:41.960 --> 2:25:47.000]  Ivanka to try to stay in the Paris climate treaty they would like to try to keep evidently
[2:25:47.000 --> 2:25:52.440]  a middle ground and try to rationalize that you know we don't have to say anything about it we
[2:25:52.440 --> 2:25:58.280]  can just kind of quietly leave it there as we pointed out before Chris said if you leave it
[2:25:58.280 --> 2:26:02.280]  there it's going to be the foundation for future regulation just as we see with Obamacare if we
[2:26:02.280 --> 2:26:07.320]  don't repeal the fundamental stuff there we can we can mess around and rearrange the deck chairs
[2:26:07.320 --> 2:26:11.400]  of these mandates but the fundamental basis is still going to be there and that's true
[2:26:11.400 --> 2:26:18.200]  with the climate treaty and as Chris Horner said the State Department guidelines establish what the
[2:26:18.200 --> 2:26:23.320]  treaty criteria are of course we know in the Constitution as well as the Paris Agreement
[2:26:23.320 --> 2:26:28.840]  requires Senate ratification to be valid under our Constitution either do it legally or get out
[2:26:28.840 --> 2:26:33.240]  you can't set on this fence and it's going to be dangerous to leave this in place for the future
[2:26:33.240 --> 2:26:38.280]  isn't it absolutely and that is one of the one of the plans is to send it to the Senate and
[2:26:38.280 --> 2:26:42.360]  take up a vote if they vote it down and it's done I mean that's like you said that's the way the
[2:26:42.360 --> 2:26:46.840]  Constitution laid it out and that's why I'm not sure why we're having this debate you know we
[2:26:46.840 --> 2:26:51.560]  we're banging our heads against the wall saying I thought we won the election and I think you're
[2:26:51.560 --> 2:26:57.800]  going to see and I'm sure you're you remember they read my lips no new taxes right that's right
[2:26:57.800 --> 2:27:03.720]  I mean I yeah this could be one of those moments for him I mean I we see I put out an ad which we
[2:27:03.720 --> 2:27:09.000]  had on our site as well you may have seen taking that very clip that candidate Trump set on the
[2:27:09.000 --> 2:27:13.320]  trail last year I don't think he could have been any more clear about what his plans were and why
[2:27:13.320 --> 2:27:18.920]  he was going to get out exactly so they can they can make this help your organization to make this
[2:27:18.920 --> 2:27:23.880]  more of an issue what else can people do to to get this going talking about it on social media
[2:27:23.880 --> 2:27:29.320]  making sure that President Trump understands that we want him to keep this a promise that we understand
[2:27:29.320 --> 2:27:33.720]  the danger of leaving that thing sitting there what can people do yeah exactly I mean all the
[2:27:33.720 --> 2:27:36.840]  things that they did during the campaign I mean they need to be tweeting about it they need to
[2:27:36.840 --> 2:27:40.280]  be posting on Facebook about it they need to be getting to the White House they need to be getting
[2:27:40.280 --> 2:27:45.320]  to some of the other people outside of the the ones you mentioned there's a few other people in
[2:27:45.320 --> 2:27:49.320]  the White House themselves who need to hear from this but most of all they need to make noise and
[2:27:49.320 --> 2:27:55.560]  say look we voted for you we took we took a pass on this or a flyer on this and you said you were
[2:27:55.560 --> 2:27:59.720]  going to do this and you need to do this I mean these are the people that put him in there and
[2:27:59.720 --> 2:28:03.960]  the ones that are telling him otherwise are not the ones that have voted for him you know Ivanka
[2:28:03.960 --> 2:28:08.600]  Jared's friends from Manhattan I can guarantee you did not vote for their father and I think it's
[2:28:08.600 --> 2:28:15.000]  very important to understand that the Washington establishment knows how to leave the framework
[2:28:15.000 --> 2:28:19.320]  in place we saw it with Obamacare we saw that they said well phase two we're going to have
[2:28:20.120 --> 2:28:25.560]  the the secretary come in and get rid of certain things and and we can try to do that at the EPA
[2:28:25.560 --> 2:28:29.960]  we can they set up this situation where they decide they're going to kill an entire industry the
[2:28:29.960 --> 2:28:34.040]  coal industry they talked about bankrupting it and anybody that tried to create that it wasn't
[2:28:34.040 --> 2:28:38.280]  even concerned about whether or not they could do it cleanly they simply wanted to destroy that
[2:28:38.280 --> 2:28:42.440]  industry and they wanted to subsidize another industry the solar industry specifically corporations
[2:28:42.440 --> 2:28:47.160]  like Cylindra we saw how that worked out for us so we don't want to leave that mechanism there that
[2:28:47.160 --> 2:28:51.400]  justification there just like we don't want to leave it there with Obamacare that's the thing
[2:28:51.400 --> 2:28:55.000]  that is so important and that's what people need to understand the public needs understand that if
[2:28:55.000 --> 2:29:00.840]  we leave the endangerment clause there that Obama put in and if we leave this ambiguous situation
[2:29:00.840 --> 2:29:05.960]  about the Paris climate treaty are we in are we out well let's not talk about that they will revive
[2:29:05.960 --> 2:29:12.440]  this with the next president that comes in and they will move this forward if we don't pull this
[2:29:12.440 --> 2:29:17.400]  thing out and repeal it that's a very important thing or have a vote up and down as you point out
[2:29:17.400 --> 2:29:21.720]  take that to the Senate exactly and the other thing about leaving it there which I think you
[2:29:21.720 --> 2:29:25.800]  already touched on is then you have the whole court system in the NRDC that the environmental
[2:29:25.800 --> 2:29:31.320]  group is just lowering up lowering up all over the place and so don't deal with these precedents
[2:29:31.320 --> 2:29:36.040]  now in a very clean legal way you're just going to put you you're going to leave it up to the ninth
[2:29:36.040 --> 2:29:41.560]  circus in California decide that's right you leave that framework there they will use it to hang us
[2:29:41.560 --> 2:29:45.560]  thank you so much Craig Richardson ene legal org stay with us when we come back

[2:33:23.080 --> 2:33:34.280]  jones we did not elect avonka trump to be the 45th president of states i think she's talented
[2:33:34.280 --> 2:33:40.600]  she's beautiful i think the dress that she wears her clothing liner cool i have nothing against
[2:33:40.600 --> 2:33:45.480]  her personally or jared kushner but we didn't elect him to be president either he's a democrat
[2:33:46.200 --> 2:33:50.680]  his dad went to prison for fraud his 666 buildings going you know sideways
[2:33:50.680 --> 2:33:57.240]  the communist chinese you know are involved with him we told you about that months ago weeks ago
[2:33:57.240 --> 2:34:02.520]  now it's the new york times today we didn't elect her and she's over in germany with merkel
[2:34:02.520 --> 2:34:08.520]  that opened the borders up for all the islamicists 80 percent more trajan men and she says for women
[2:34:08.520 --> 2:34:13.480]  we should let refugees in and that her dad's wrong and she wants him to change his mind what
[2:34:13.480 --> 2:34:19.960]  what from seven unvetted countries where the islamicists just issue fake passports basically
[2:34:21.400 --> 2:34:26.360]  to to terrorist isis is being defeated right now al-qaeda is being defeated in syria
[2:34:26.360 --> 2:34:30.920]  trups keep his promise on that as the rand corporation globalists have come out admitted
[2:34:30.920 --> 2:34:34.920]  that's going to squeeze out those terrorists they're looking for more terror attacks from that
[2:34:34.920 --> 2:34:39.160]  and isis is ordering those attacks we see them happening the car attacks the bomb attacks
[2:34:39.160 --> 2:34:43.320]  the stabbing attacks the shooting attacks almost every day in europe so the answers bring
[2:34:43.320 --> 2:34:49.960]  more in because you're for women more genital mutilation more burkas i saw an article as
[2:34:49.960 --> 2:34:58.520]  interspeak old pushing it german newspapers are saying women should wear a jibs to fight islamophobia
[2:34:59.080 --> 2:35:04.680]  much of the soros groups have women doing it these marches it's so surreal to see naked lesbians
[2:35:04.680 --> 2:35:09.160]  with their tops off saying a la hotbar when in muslim countries they'd be in prison or dead
[2:35:09.160 --> 2:35:14.360]  and you know just like that and that's a fact that's not as homophobia that's the reality that
[2:35:14.360 --> 2:35:22.520]  they're not tolerant they're not tolerant of less radical muslims like curds and all whites i mean
[2:35:22.520 --> 2:35:27.160]  that's a fact not a conspiracy theory the fact that i'm informed the fact that i know what i'm
[2:35:27.160 --> 2:35:32.280]  talking about the fact that i have history in common sense and then in fact that trumps all the
[2:35:32.280 --> 2:35:36.120]  pseudo-intellectual fake left us out there they don't know what to do if they make jokes about
[2:35:36.120 --> 2:35:45.240]  people that are informed this is me off so we didn't elect her now here's the paradox i always
[2:35:45.240 --> 2:35:51.000]  said the elite were truly after trump the elite didn't like him because of his nationalism his
[2:35:51.000 --> 2:35:55.720]  anti-globalism said he actually wanted to be president i said the danger is the elite really
[2:35:55.720 --> 2:36:04.440]  hated that was real but what if he's just coming in as an outside predator group to take globalism
[2:36:04.440 --> 2:36:09.080]  that they used america to build away from them and then use it for his own system
[2:36:10.600 --> 2:36:16.040]  that remains to be seen if he's you know getting funding off of it or something but but
[2:36:16.040 --> 2:36:20.040]  the globalist didn't care whether he was for real or not the fact was he was coming in to take over
[2:36:20.040 --> 2:36:26.200]  their operation and so that's why that's so important and he's done so good on moving for
[2:36:26.200 --> 2:36:31.560]  tax cuts demonizing and trying to overthrow obama care and getting all the jobs back on the stock
[2:36:31.560 --> 2:36:36.760]  market and killing tpp the list goes on and on that i say hey this is really great but it is
[2:36:36.760 --> 2:36:42.120]  paradoxical on the other side you know he's saying go after wiki leaks when wiki leaks got him
[2:36:42.120 --> 2:36:50.040]  elected that that's a stab in the back and you know all this other craziness and i don't even
[2:36:50.040 --> 2:36:57.240]  know what to say at this point about that because it's just such a flip-flop and he told wiki leaks
[2:36:57.240 --> 2:37:01.800]  please release more of the data so that means you gotta arrest yourself if that's what you're
[2:37:01.800 --> 2:37:06.360]  gonna do trump i mean it's crazy so what is your ci director and what the sessions doing i'm not out
[2:37:06.360 --> 2:37:10.840]  to get those guys i'm not their enemies i want to be real and decent that's quite a flip-flop
[2:37:12.520 --> 2:37:19.000]  so it's a paradox i'm glad we didn't get hillary but think of how undead hillary was how pathetic
[2:37:19.000 --> 2:37:25.640]  she was everybody would have come out against her the good news is trump for the nationalist brand
[2:37:25.640 --> 2:37:30.520]  is very strong nationalism spreading all over the world very very exciting things are happening
[2:37:31.240 --> 2:37:37.800]  this is a great time to be alive and so we can't just become demoralized if trump starts going
[2:37:38.440 --> 2:37:43.800]  sideways or office trajectory so because all over the world depends about the win all the
[2:37:43.800 --> 2:37:48.120]  world nationalism is rising it doesn't mean it's going to be perfect but it's the idea of sovereignty
[2:37:48.120 --> 2:37:53.640]  and governments and systems for prosperity and open free society is not authoritarian globalism
[2:37:53.640 --> 2:38:01.240]  which is crony capitalism and we've got record numbers are elected in the house the freedom caucus
[2:38:01.240 --> 2:38:06.440]  not selling us out saying no to trump and the democrats on their deal that wasn't as you know
[2:38:07.400 --> 2:38:11.640]  what they promised on obama care and we've got 900 new people elected the legislatures
[2:38:11.640 --> 2:38:15.320]  and we've got all these new governors and just let's stand the liberty movement let's have more
[2:38:15.320 --> 2:38:19.400]  people run for office let's have more people support independent media telling the truth
[2:38:19.400 --> 2:38:25.640]  and let's just continue to move forward with this movement of national sovereignty and and freedom
[2:38:25.640 --> 2:38:31.560]  and and western civilization and renaissance and and and the printing press and just an open free
[2:38:31.560 --> 2:38:37.720]  culture soros calls itself you know the open society or whatever he's the opposite of an open
[2:38:37.720 --> 2:38:43.880]  society pushing authoritarianism all over the world and so this is a great time to be alive
[2:38:43.880 --> 2:38:52.040]  ladies and gentlemen this is an amazing time to be alive and it's just great to be alive
[2:38:52.600 --> 2:38:57.320]  it's great to be associated with all of you so don't let the fact that trump hasn't gotten
[2:38:57.320 --> 2:39:01.960]  everything done channel i've done or those daughters out there doing bizarre stuff get
[2:39:01.960 --> 2:39:07.720]  you depressed because we have come from being a tiny fringe movement against globalism a decade
[2:39:07.720 --> 2:39:11.800]  ago 20 years ago to now be the hottest thing in the world because of you spreading the word
[2:39:11.800 --> 2:39:17.640]  because of you taking action that's an incredibly exciting thing so again i want to thank you all
[2:39:17.640 --> 2:39:23.240]  for your prayers i want to thank you all for your support but understand you're supporting yourself
[2:39:23.960 --> 2:39:30.280]  in these fights you're supporting yourself in the huge awakening uh that's taking place
[2:39:31.880 --> 2:39:35.560]  you are the resistance that isn't something where i pat you on the head and say
[2:39:35.560 --> 2:39:40.200]  if you're receiving this transmission you're the resistance you really are the power you are the
[2:39:40.200 --> 2:39:47.000]  people we have this fake sports culture fake you know liberal culture fake video game culture all
[2:39:47.000 --> 2:39:51.800]  this stuff that's not real culture that's just entertainment when we when we make politics and
[2:39:51.800 --> 2:39:57.800]  being involved in being informed and being active and promoting freedom the culture and make it fun
[2:39:57.800 --> 2:40:05.240]  the sport it is the real sport the life sport the purpose driven life the whole world opens up to you
[2:40:07.320 --> 2:40:10.040]  young people think they don't have any future because globalism is trying to
[2:40:10.040 --> 2:40:15.880]  make humans obsolete going to this whole robotic technocracy we couldn't demand with our purchases
[2:40:15.880 --> 2:40:23.720]  and what we promote and what we rate and what we you know do well how we spend how we speak word
[2:40:23.720 --> 2:40:28.680]  of mouth for the culture of the world we want to build with our choices they want to bully us with
[2:40:28.680 --> 2:40:33.480]  political correctness shrink our language tell us we can't have choices tell us if we don't accept
[2:40:33.480 --> 2:40:40.040]  being enslaved that we're racist all this is divide and conquer lies and we must resist it
[2:40:41.160 --> 2:40:47.400]  i once drove in 2000 down this very road congress an old car with rick link rick link letter sitting
[2:40:47.400 --> 2:40:53.080]  in the back with cameras on me for the film waking life i was out right down the same road
[2:40:53.720 --> 2:40:57.560]  in a morning i don't like this about 10 in the morning it's 8 in the morning 8 30
[2:40:57.560 --> 2:41:02.440]  i remember saying you know this is the dynamic human spirit that refuses to resist left right
[2:41:02.440 --> 2:41:07.640]  all this is just distractions by the elite when it gets down to it we need basic human freedom
[2:41:07.640 --> 2:41:12.840]  and it's about that and what gives us more freedom and what empowers us and what makes us truer and
[2:41:12.840 --> 2:41:19.240]  more bona fide closer to god and that's what this is all about now back to david night and the live
[2:41:19.240 --> 2:41:25.560]  transmission this is the info or info wars dot com four slash show the full might of the system
[2:41:25.560 --> 2:41:31.800]  things that can shut us down things that can shut you down so let's man the guns of the info war
[2:41:31.800 --> 2:41:36.920]  with god's help and your vision and you're refusing to back down or submit we are invincible
[2:41:37.560 --> 2:41:43.720]  i'm alshones this is the info war all right now i want to take a look at some of the developments
[2:41:43.720 --> 2:41:48.120]  in the last 24 hours we've had some developments on obama care we've had developments of course on
[2:41:48.680 --> 2:41:55.240]  tax reform and i think it's a very telling story here because we see the real opposition
[2:41:55.240 --> 2:41:59.960]  to donald trump is coming from within the white house as alex was just talking about the jared
[2:41:59.960 --> 2:42:06.200]  and ivanka and rex tillerson you know pushing back against the paris climate treaty saying that uh
[2:42:06.200 --> 2:42:08.520]  you know we're just going to kind of pretend that it's not there we're going to leave the
[2:42:08.520 --> 2:42:13.800]  framework there just as they want to leave the framework of obama care in place and do some
[2:42:13.800 --> 2:42:21.160]  minor tweaking to it i was glad to see that trump took the lead on tax reform that's exactly what
[2:42:21.160 --> 2:42:26.680]  should have happened with obama care and i hopefully he learned a lesson from the disaster of obama
[2:42:26.680 --> 2:42:33.480]  care repeal because he let paul ryan who does not want to repeal obama care make sure you understand
[2:42:33.480 --> 2:42:38.920]  that okay he was the running mate of mit romney he and mit romney were picked because they were
[2:42:38.920 --> 2:42:44.360]  going to enact romney care if we didn't get obama care and romney care had already been put in place
[2:42:44.360 --> 2:42:50.280]  in massachusetts exactly like obama care so the establishment had decided that they were going
[2:42:50.280 --> 2:42:55.960]  to give us government run health care one way or the other and although the republicans ran on
[2:42:55.960 --> 2:43:02.280]  repealing obama care they never had a plan to do it donald trump did have a plan to repeal obama
[2:43:02.280 --> 2:43:09.240]  care to replace mandates with markets to replace coercion with choice to empower you as a consumer
[2:43:09.240 --> 2:43:14.360]  to get cheaper health care that was the stated goal of obama care they called it the affordable
[2:43:14.360 --> 2:43:19.960]  care act you know when paul ryan put out they put it out there all he did was change affordable to
[2:43:19.960 --> 2:43:26.440]  american because we all know it's not affordable you can't keep selling that lie anymore and so now
[2:43:26.440 --> 2:43:33.880]  we've had the gop conservatives who took so much heat unfortunately from donald trump and i don't
[2:43:33.880 --> 2:43:39.880]  understand why he poured so much scorn on them the people who should have had scorn poured on them
[2:43:40.520 --> 2:43:44.440]  were the people who took advantage and tried to go in the other direction from donald trump
[2:43:44.440 --> 2:43:47.720]  not the people who are running in the same direction with them so now they've looked at it and said
[2:43:47.720 --> 2:43:52.760]  well all right uh president trump is going to oppose us on this the establishment is going to
[2:43:52.760 --> 2:43:57.480]  oppose us on this we'll try to do the best that we can and we'll try to move a little bit away
[2:43:57.480 --> 2:44:03.160]  from some of this but the basic fundamental structure remains just as we see with the environment
[2:44:03.160 --> 2:44:09.560]  as well and a good example of where this is going as i pointed out earlier california has now passed
[2:44:09.560 --> 2:44:15.080]  the first committee test of a single payer health care bill and understand that what we're talking
[2:44:15.080 --> 2:44:20.680]  about there is government run government controlled health care that's what hillary tried to establish
[2:44:20.680 --> 2:44:28.040]  25 years ago and of course california is right there with her they they want full on socialism
[2:44:28.040 --> 2:44:32.440]  and it's interesting as they pass this thing it wasn't even close five to two in the senate health
[2:44:32.440 --> 2:44:39.000]  committee uh democrats and republicans still are uneasy about the major question they say in the la
[2:44:39.000 --> 2:44:46.360]  times how will it be paid for and they've got a lot to pay for the state would would supply all
[2:44:46.360 --> 2:44:54.280]  medical expenses for everyone including people who aren't even legal immigrants everybody worldwide
[2:44:54.280 --> 2:44:59.640]  can come to california and get their health care paid for and so what are they going to pay for
[2:44:59.640 --> 2:45:05.800]  they're going to pay for inpatient outpatient emergency services dental vision mental health
[2:45:05.800 --> 2:45:11.640]  nursing home care everything for everybody the measure says the program would be funded by quote
[2:45:11.640 --> 2:45:18.200]  unquote broad-based revenue but it doesn't specify where that comes from so we're just gonna work
[2:45:18.200 --> 2:45:24.920]  this is a venezuelan mindset folks they are they are going to destroy health care they're going to
[2:45:24.920 --> 2:45:28.920]  destroy the state of california they're well on the way to doing that and quite frankly when we
[2:45:28.920 --> 2:45:36.920]  look at the tax plan there are three points of opposition to it and one of them is our high
[2:45:36.920 --> 2:45:41.640]  tax states like california in new york california wants to have universal health care for everybody
[2:45:41.640 --> 2:45:45.720]  going to pay for everything you can imagine for everyone even if they're not citizens of the
[2:45:45.720 --> 2:45:50.680]  united states or citizens of california whatever and of course they're going to have to raise their
[2:45:51.720 --> 2:45:56.200]  income taxes and they're hoping then that they can then deduct those income taxes from the federal
[2:45:56.200 --> 2:46:01.000]  taxes and put it on the federal deficit so they want to move the california deficit
[2:46:01.000 --> 2:46:06.440]  and federalize it and that's one of the things that is very controversial that's one of the
[2:46:06.440 --> 2:46:13.720]  points of opposition they say that would take about a trillion dollars off of the deficit increase
[2:46:13.720 --> 2:46:17.800]  to say that high tax states like new york and california the people who live in those states
[2:46:17.800 --> 2:46:22.760]  would not be able to deduct their state taxes from their federal taxes and i think that's exactly
[2:46:22.760 --> 2:46:28.280]  right we don't want to see that but then of course the other points of opposition to it were as usual
[2:46:28.280 --> 2:46:34.440]  envy people who have businesses people who have income are going to get uh tax cuts and the more
[2:46:34.440 --> 2:46:40.360]  you have the more your tax cut is going to be and it's like yeah exactly so therefore if somebody
[2:46:40.360 --> 2:46:46.360]  else is going to get a higher return than you are off of the tax cut then you should oppose it that's
[2:46:46.360 --> 2:46:51.320]  the politics of envy that's what takes us down to the bottom but the third point of opposition
[2:46:51.320 --> 2:46:59.960]  is the idea and this is being sold now within the GOP the GOP people are saying this is going
[2:46:59.960 --> 2:47:07.160]  to increase the deficit if we cut taxes no it doesn't we've seen over and over again that tax
[2:47:07.160 --> 2:47:13.800]  cuts mean an increase in tax revenue we saw it with ronald reagan those massive tax cuts and i
[2:47:13.800 --> 2:47:18.760]  had an article that i covered on the news last night in north carolina carolina partnership
[2:47:18.760 --> 2:47:24.520]  for reform pointed out that in their state they did tax cuts and it boosted revenue as you would
[2:47:24.520 --> 2:47:30.760]  expect they had done projections in 2014 and they had projected what the revenue collections were
[2:47:30.760 --> 2:47:35.240]  going to be in the future then the conservatives cut taxes so what happened to those projections
[2:47:36.200 --> 2:47:42.520]  did they get less taxes no they got more taxes when they cut the rates we've always seen that
[2:47:42.520 --> 2:47:48.040]  and as they point out faster economic growth generates government revenue and tax reduction
[2:47:48.040 --> 2:47:53.160]  helps the economy we've seen that over and over again it's not a projection it's not a theory it's
[2:47:53.160 --> 2:48:00.040]  historical fact and so they show here that in 2014 they actually got 3.6 percent more revenue
[2:48:00.040 --> 2:48:04.360]  than they thought they would get before in 2015 they got three and a half percent more revenue
[2:48:04.360 --> 2:48:10.040]  already for 2016 they haven't finished their fiscal year yet but it 570 million dollars
[2:48:10.040 --> 2:48:15.080]  above their projection through march because they cut taxes in north carolina that's the way that
[2:48:15.080 --> 2:48:19.720]  it works why did we get a massive deficit increase under ronald reagan well it's because they wouldn't
[2:48:19.720 --> 2:48:26.360]  control spending see even if you get record tax revenue as we are currently getting record tax
[2:48:26.360 --> 2:48:32.040]  revenue drudge points out all the time look we've got you know each quarter we're setting a new record
[2:48:32.040 --> 2:48:38.360]  and tax collection but they're growing the spending so much faster that creates the deficit so the
[2:48:38.360 --> 2:48:44.360]  problem is not that our tax rates are too high as a matter of fact if they increase the tax rates
[2:48:44.360 --> 2:48:49.800]  they will get less revenue and the deficit will grow even faster but what we see happening is and
[2:48:49.800 --> 2:48:55.000]  i pointed out last night paul ryan had funded a private study and then they leaked it to the press
[2:48:55.880 --> 2:49:01.560]  saying that tax revenue is going to go down not true not true it isn't going to go down but now we
[2:49:01.560 --> 2:49:07.480]  have others in the republican party trying to lay the ground work to push back against a tax
[2:49:08.280 --> 2:49:13.560]  cut a tax reform and as the hill points out while most republicans favor cutting taxes at least
[2:49:13.560 --> 2:49:18.120]  that's what they tell us when it comes election time don't they they're worried they're worried
[2:49:18.120 --> 2:49:24.200]  that the proposal will spike the deficit and it's already leading to concerns that could cost
[2:49:24.200 --> 2:49:31.960]  trump votes from his own party look his opposition is the republican party his opposition is paul ryan
[2:49:31.960 --> 2:49:37.160]  and i hope and i'm hopeful that the fact that they brought this thing out that they came out first
[2:49:37.160 --> 2:49:44.520]  with this is a sign that he understands that paul ryan is against him i think is very important
[2:49:44.520 --> 2:49:51.400]  when we look at the way they spend this even as the conservatives the freedom caucus said
[2:49:51.400 --> 2:49:55.720]  all right we're going to move we'll we'll concede we're not going to hold out for repeal of obama
[2:49:55.720 --> 2:50:00.440]  care which is what the voters want which is what we campaigned on which is what donald trump campaigned
[2:50:00.440 --> 2:50:04.600]  on and won it's a winning proposition it's what the voters want we know that we're going to be
[2:50:04.600 --> 2:50:08.920]  the scapegoats for all this because you guys aren't going to the rest of republican establishment
[2:50:08.920 --> 2:50:15.320]  isn't going to go with it so when they move then it's reported by the hill that the glp takes a
[2:50:15.320 --> 2:50:21.480]  step forward on obama care replacement but the centrists remain elusive they say moderates remain
[2:50:21.480 --> 2:50:25.480]  elusive several centrists lawmakers said they could not say whether they would support the bill
[2:50:25.480 --> 2:50:33.080]  these people not centrists they're not moderate they're hardline statists they are supporting
[2:50:33.080 --> 2:50:42.920]  a an insurance mandate that is both socialism and fascism it's unconstitutional it's anti market
[2:50:42.920 --> 2:50:48.680]  they are not moderate they are not centrists but of course the press calls in that stay with us

[2:52:13.960 --> 2:52:19.160]  started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride the bad member of the halogen family into
[2:52:19.160 --> 2:52:24.840]  the water they took the good halogen and put the deadly halogen in and when the fukushima crisis

[2:54:11.880 --> 2:54:16.440]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david knight i want to talk about a novel approach to
[2:54:16.440 --> 2:54:23.640]  get the wall funded first we have um editorials from cns and others saying seriously are we not
[2:54:23.640 --> 2:54:30.200]  going to fund the wall but we are going to fund planned parenthood what's going on we got democrat
[2:54:31.640 --> 2:54:35.400]  representatives vowing that the wall will never be built we're not going to do that
[2:54:35.400 --> 2:54:41.320]  we also had the article that we had yesterday uh reporting uh laura ingram with shon hannity saying
[2:54:41.320 --> 2:54:47.320]  i've got reports that there were senators who laughed out loud at the idea of uh trump's wall
[2:54:47.320 --> 2:54:52.520]  g.o.p senators so you've got the establishment saying it didn't going to happen we're not going to do
[2:54:52.520 --> 2:54:57.400]  a wall and of course the first thing they do is pull that they can fund everything but they won't
[2:54:57.400 --> 2:55:01.640]  fund anything at the border as a matter of fact the democrat said we're going to scrutinize this
[2:55:01.640 --> 2:55:05.800]  and make sure there's nothing in there for extra border agents either they don't want anything at
[2:55:05.800 --> 2:55:10.840]  the border and of course a couple of days ago i talked to ildefonso or teas is with breitbart
[2:55:10.840 --> 2:55:15.640]  about the border and you know he said hey the border is not open the border is controlled by the
[2:55:15.640 --> 2:55:21.800]  cartels they decide who comes in and who doesn't come in so i'm going to give you a novel approach
[2:55:21.800 --> 2:55:27.720]  for how to uh fund that stay with me uh ted cruise had a great approach for this uh just
[2:55:27.720 --> 2:55:33.160]  want to remind you that we have a flash special liver shield is now 30 off at info wars dot
[2:55:33.160 --> 2:55:37.640]  com and of course we were talking to dr group earlier he was talking about uh that had a lot
[2:55:37.640 --> 2:55:42.920]  of calls about people who were diagnosed with fatty liver and as he pointed out your liver
[2:55:42.920 --> 2:55:47.480]  is one of the fastest regenerating parts of your body you can do things to improve your
[2:55:47.480 --> 2:55:53.000]  liver health liver shield uses a powerful blend of organic and wild crafted herbs especially

[2:55:58.600 --> 2:56:02.520]  try liver shield for 30 off right now we have a flash sale it's not going to last very long
[2:56:02.520 --> 2:56:06.840]  go to info wars life dot com and also we still have our special caveman

[2:56:19.720 --> 2:56:27.080]  it is now 53 off retail at info wars store dot com that's uh caveman true paleo formula
[2:56:27.080 --> 2:56:33.080]  drink mix i always played this clip here from ted cruise he had a novel approach for how to
[2:56:33.080 --> 2:56:38.680]  fund the wall because remember our border is owned by the cartels that's the reality folks they
[2:56:38.680 --> 2:56:43.960]  decide who comes in and who doesn't they collect the money even though we had a top of mexican
[2:56:43.960 --> 2:56:48.760]  officials say hey you keep talking about the uh the wall we're going to charge americans to come
[2:56:48.760 --> 2:56:53.000]  into our country know the people who control the border the people who charge people to go back and
[2:56:53.000 --> 2:56:58.200]  forth are the cartels here's what ted cruise had to say about how to fund the wall your plan
[2:56:58.200 --> 2:57:04.120]  senator is called the el chopo act what is this well you know as you know the democrats are
[2:57:04.120 --> 2:57:08.760]  threatening government shutdown because they're so opposed to building a wall they're so opposed to
[2:57:08.760 --> 2:57:13.160]  finally securing our border and and so i've been trying to think about how can we get this done
[2:57:13.160 --> 2:57:18.360]  how can we build the wall even in the face of democratic obstruction and so yesterday i filed
[2:57:18.360 --> 2:57:24.440]  the el chopo act that provides that if el chopo is convicted you know the fame mexican drug lord
[2:57:24.440 --> 2:57:30.920]  the estimates are that his criminal fortune is roughly worth about 14 billion dollars wow now
[2:57:30.920 --> 2:57:36.680]  coincidentally the estimates for the cost to build a wall range from 14 to 20 billion dollars
[2:57:36.680 --> 2:57:42.040]  and so my legislation provides that if those assets are forfeited those assets from el chopo
[2:57:42.040 --> 2:57:47.400]  will go directly to building a wall and to securing the border that's good i like the fact
[2:57:47.400 --> 2:57:52.200]  that he says if el chopo is convicted we need to get away from civil asset forfeiture i don't
[2:57:52.200 --> 2:57:59.160]  support it even for el chopo we have to have due process even for the worst among us if he's
[2:57:59.160 --> 2:58:02.760]  obviously a criminal it shouldn't be any problem getting a conviction it should not be a problem
[2:58:02.760 --> 2:58:07.400]  getting a conviction for him we should not throw the rule of law and trials out but i think that's
[2:58:07.400 --> 2:58:10.840]  a brilliant plan the mexican government says they're going to charge people go across let's
[2:58:10.840 --> 2:58:15.960]  understand it's the cartels who own the border let's let the cartels pay for the wall to protect us
[2:58:15.960 --> 2:58:21.480]  when we come back i'm going to talk about some moves towards sanctuary cities today the texas house

[3:00:22.200 --> 3:00:25.880]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night coming up in the next segment we'll have
[3:00:25.880 --> 3:00:30.120]  oan shorter with a fourth hour i want to talk about sanctuary cities because there's been a lot of
[3:00:30.120 --> 3:00:35.320]  developments on that this last week first we had the trump administration say you know we're going
[3:00:35.320 --> 3:00:43.400]  to take action against the cities that will not cooperate and legally inform immigration about
[3:00:43.400 --> 3:00:48.040]  people who they have arrested or come in contact with that are in violation of the law they will
[3:00:48.040 --> 3:00:54.760]  not pass that information along and then you had a judge in the ninth circuit where else who said
[3:00:54.760 --> 3:01:01.960]  no you can't do that and so on tuesday attorney general jeff sessions met with mayors of 15 large
[3:01:01.960 --> 3:01:07.960]  cities including many that were so-called sanctuary jurisdictions and he told them
[3:01:07.960 --> 3:01:13.160]  that we have a law here and he pointed out he said this is a quote this is on bright part he says
[3:01:13.160 --> 3:01:17.080]  the department of justice will fulfill our responsibility to uphold and enforce our nation's
[3:01:17.080 --> 3:01:25.640]  immigration laws including and he quotes a law eight usc 1373 he said under the obama administration
[3:01:25.640 --> 3:01:30.840]  the department of justice required certain guarantees to certify compliance with federal law
[3:01:30.840 --> 3:01:38.520]  and that would include obeying eight usc 1373 as a condition for receiving grant funding so you
[3:01:38.520 --> 3:01:44.200]  see what he's saying he said the obama administration required that you comply with certain federal
[3:01:44.200 --> 3:01:51.720]  laws one of those laws that you had to comply with in order to get grant funding was eight usc
[3:01:51.720 --> 3:01:58.760]  1373 what does that mean well that law prohibits local jurisdictions from preventing the immigration
[3:01:58.760 --> 3:02:03.800]  naturalization service from getting immigration status information on people that they detain
[3:02:04.760 --> 3:02:10.120]  so in other words what he's saying is is that no you're not i don't care what the judge says the
[3:02:10.120 --> 3:02:16.680]  judge is in direct violation and contradiction of the law the law said and in the obama administration
[3:02:16.680 --> 3:02:22.520]  they did it you have to comply with these certain rules or we will not give you grant funding today
[3:02:22.520 --> 3:02:29.560]  the texas house okayed uh withholding state funds from sanctuary cities and of course that would be
[3:02:29.560 --> 3:02:34.440]  places like austin where we are we had our newly elected chair for lear this year say i'm not going
[3:02:34.440 --> 3:02:41.560]  to give any information to ins about anybody that we have detained except for three crimes
[3:02:42.520 --> 3:02:47.560]  those murder and something else okay a couple other things and then after a little while
[3:02:47.560 --> 3:02:51.960]  somebody said wait a minute we just had this illegal alien arrested and he's got multiple
[3:02:51.960 --> 3:02:57.160]  sexual assault offenses alleged to have committed and so forth you're not going to let ins know about
[3:02:57.160 --> 3:03:03.320]  that uh all right uh well not not three but we'll go with four okay so she starts adding these things
[3:03:03.320 --> 3:03:12.920]  ad hoc as it becomes quite clear that her political slant is putting the public at risk it's kind of
[3:03:12.920 --> 3:03:18.600]  like the uh money python skit you know the spanish inquisition we have three things that we will not
[3:03:18.600 --> 3:03:22.920]  that we will tell them oh well make that four you know nobody expects the hispanic inquisition
[3:03:22.920 --> 3:03:28.760]  but now what they're saying is we're not only going to hear in texas we're not going only to
[3:03:28.760 --> 3:03:35.000]  withhold funding from county and local governments if they refuse to tell ins about people that they
[3:03:35.000 --> 3:03:41.080]  have detained but they're also saying if you're going to be that kind of sheriff or police chief
[3:03:41.080 --> 3:03:48.360]  if we refuse to turn over information about people who are not only here criminally trespassing in our
[3:03:48.360 --> 3:03:54.200]  country foreign citizens who are criminally trespassing that's the first crime they committed
[3:03:54.200 --> 3:03:59.240]  the next thing they usually do is usually they have fraudulent identity papers or they steal
[3:03:59.240 --> 3:04:05.160]  somebody's id papers so usually these people that are coming here and violation of our immigration laws
[3:04:05.160 --> 3:04:10.360]  are already two time losers and then when they do other things like drunk driving uh that she
[3:04:10.360 --> 3:04:14.440]  doesn't want to turn them over for or sexual assault that she initially did not want to turn
[3:04:14.440 --> 3:04:19.720]  them over for uh you're not going to give the this information to ins to see if they're also
[3:04:19.720 --> 3:04:25.640]  violating other laws uh then we're going to put you in jail because you are a part of the problem
[3:04:26.680 --> 3:04:33.080]  so you have to understand that uh you you just cannot enable this what you're doing then is
[3:04:33.080 --> 3:04:37.720]  you're participating in the crimes that these people are committing and it is a serious thing
[3:04:38.360 --> 3:04:43.880]  to violate these laws as we pointed out uh many times if you let people come in for economic
[3:04:43.880 --> 3:04:48.280]  reasons and you say that's okay they don't need to be vetted they don't need to follow any legal
[3:04:48.280 --> 3:04:52.120]  process then what's going to happen with a fully open border is they're going to be followed in
[3:04:52.760 --> 3:04:58.360]  by drug cartels by ms-13 those people that they're trying to run from are going to follow them into
[3:04:58.360 --> 3:05:02.600]  this country and they'll attack us as well oh insurers coming up trump just signed an executive
[3:05:02.600 --> 3:05:07.480]  order to pull the federal government out of k through 12 education following through on a campaign
[3:05:07.480 --> 3:05:13.000]  promise to return school control to state and local officials titled education federalism executive
[3:05:13.000 --> 3:05:19.080]  order it directs education secretary betsy devos to launch a 300 day review of obama era regulations
[3:05:19.080 --> 3:05:23.880]  and guidance for school districts and gives her the power to modify or repeal measures she deems
[3:05:23.880 --> 3:05:28.680]  and overreach by the federal government it was amazing to hear liberals scream and cry as betsy
[3:05:28.680 --> 3:05:33.400]  devos was being confirmed and all i was saying the entire time was good we need to get rid of
[3:05:33.400 --> 3:05:37.400]  the department of education you wonder why your local schools don't have money to pay teachers
[3:05:37.400 --> 3:05:42.360]  or for upkeep it's because that money is being held by the federal government don't believe me
[3:05:42.360 --> 3:05:46.760]  just read the book the deliberate dumbing down of america by charlotte isherby she was a whistleblower
[3:05:46.760 --> 3:05:51.560]  from the department of education in the 1980s and her tomb describes how the federal education
[3:05:51.560 --> 3:05:57.720]  system was designed to create automatons rob do reporting for info wars dot com and info wars nightly

[3:08:18.600 --> 3:08:29.320]  owin shroyer is that james brown or is that maxine waters wig it's tough for me to uh
[3:08:29.320 --> 3:08:33.160]  it's tough for me to disseminate between the two welcome back to the alex joneshow fourth hour
[3:08:33.160 --> 3:08:41.720]  owin shroyer now relieving david night you know it's been really tough all the politics all the
[3:08:41.720 --> 3:08:47.240]  divide and conquer all the different sides of all the different issues a lot of people butting heads
[3:08:47.240 --> 3:08:53.640]  we had the stories of families at christmas and thanksgiving fighting over politics what brings
[3:08:53.640 --> 3:08:58.920]  this together what is something that unites us well it's tough to find that stuff anymore at
[3:08:58.920 --> 3:09:04.040]  at least outside of the bread and circus perhaps i guess this is part of it but an interesting
[3:09:04.040 --> 3:09:10.840]  commercial i guess this one goes against what the pepsi commercial was trying to do i don't know i
[3:09:10.840 --> 3:09:16.760]  still don't understand the whole notion of that pepsi commercial that was a total failure but now
[3:09:16.760 --> 3:09:20.920]  heineken has just put out a commercial that is kind of the opposite now this is interesting and i've
[3:09:20.920 --> 3:09:27.480]  always said this about myself because personally i am somebody that hates politics okay i can't stand
[3:09:27.480 --> 3:09:34.520]  politics that's why i grew up loving sports and got started cutting my teeth in media in the sports
[3:09:34.520 --> 3:09:39.960]  industry but once you realize the real world issues and how much the future matters and that
[3:09:39.960 --> 3:09:46.360]  you know politics actually does matter you can't help but gravitate towards it but now this ad
[3:09:46.360 --> 3:09:51.560]  reminds me though and i think it can remind all of us where we come from so basically heineken
[3:09:51.560 --> 3:09:59.000]  does this social experiment where they take two people and i think they do it with maybe four
[3:09:59.000 --> 3:10:03.720]  different groups they take two people of totally different backgrounds totally different political
[3:10:03.720 --> 3:10:09.240]  beliefs and they have them before they meet the other person do a short video sit down
[3:10:09.240 --> 3:10:12.440]  and so then they get together and they do this little exercise and they meet each other they
[3:10:12.440 --> 3:10:20.040]  have to build what turns out to be a bar and so then after they build the bar they have to watch
[3:10:20.040 --> 3:10:26.040]  the video of the other person and what they said and their views were and of course the other person
[3:10:26.040 --> 3:10:30.680]  sees it and their draw drops are like whoa that's exactly the opposite of what i think i even insulted
[3:10:30.680 --> 3:10:37.080]  those beliefs in my short video and then they put a bar on the bars bar and they say you have two
[3:10:37.080 --> 3:10:43.080]  options you can either leave or you can enjoy a drink with the other person at the bar and discuss
[3:10:43.080 --> 3:10:49.640]  your differences and it just it just it just all came together for me in that moment because no matter
[3:10:49.640 --> 3:10:53.560]  no matter what even though we got trump in and it was a great victory for our movement
[3:10:54.200 --> 3:10:59.480]  and even though there's divide along the trump base now it's it really doesn't even matter
[3:11:00.280 --> 3:11:05.240]  because at the end of the day all humans should be able to break bread together all humans should
[3:11:05.240 --> 3:11:11.320]  be able to sit down at the table and just converse and get along and not want to fight and not want
[3:11:11.320 --> 3:11:19.720]  to steal and not want to rob and and be greedy and with nothing but political division in our world
[3:11:19.720 --> 3:11:25.320]  in our culture in our society this was a very refreshing ad from heineken i'm not sitting here
[3:11:25.320 --> 3:11:29.480]  trying to plug heineken it was just it was a refreshing thing to see because you just don't
[3:11:29.480 --> 3:11:35.400]  see it you don't see people trying to bring together people from different backgrounds
[3:11:35.400 --> 3:11:39.880]  bring it together and you say oh with the oh the open borders no no no no that's a political agenda
[3:11:39.880 --> 3:11:45.240]  let's be very clear okay that's not the democrats actually bleeding heart liberals it's always a
[3:11:45.240 --> 3:11:51.640]  political agenda all right just like uh taxing carbon yeah they did have ways to make billions
[3:11:51.640 --> 3:11:56.680]  of dollars off that ended up being didn't it so i just wanted to point that commercial out and just
[3:11:56.680 --> 3:12:02.200]  you know because a lot of people obviously don't like me for my political views you can see the
[3:12:02.200 --> 3:12:06.120]  videos on the streets when i'm trying to talk to these people and i always end up leaving the same
[3:12:06.120 --> 3:12:11.480]  way it's like you know if if i was just to sit down at the bar with that person and just sit
[3:12:11.480 --> 3:12:16.760]  down and have a conversation and not have to introduce each other with our divisions and
[3:12:16.760 --> 3:12:21.640]  what separates us before we got to know each other then maybe we could all truly get along so
[3:12:21.640 --> 3:12:30.200]  so as we're all fighting all the time now as the political vortex continues to just suck us all into
[3:12:30.200 --> 3:12:36.200]  it as the divide and conquer tactics get even stronger with the mainstream media and the fake
[3:12:36.200 --> 3:12:42.440]  news and the lying as the polarization of our society continues let's always just remember
[3:12:42.440 --> 3:12:50.760]  that we're all flesh and blood we're all we're all bone and no matter what you believe we were
[3:12:50.760 --> 3:12:58.200]  all put here by the same creator and we just don't get enough of that message anymore in our society
[3:12:58.200 --> 3:13:04.040]  and in our culture and it's too bad it really is too bad and i guess at the end of the day it just
[3:13:04.040 --> 3:13:08.680]  comes with everybody believing that we have to force our political agenda down the other one's
[3:13:08.680 --> 3:13:14.920]  throats of course i think that at this at the top starts with a totally corrupt government
[3:13:14.920 --> 3:13:20.760]  that has to make all sorts of all sorts of moves all day long on how to protect their corruption
[3:13:20.760 --> 3:13:26.680]  you know that's why every time i see some story about some obama administration former obama
[3:13:26.680 --> 3:13:32.360]  administration or former obama advisor who's out of the game not even involved anymore
[3:13:32.360 --> 3:13:37.160]  nothing to do with politics off the record off the books everything but they keep doing these
[3:13:37.160 --> 3:13:40.760]  things they keep spinning these wheels and you're like why are they even involved what are they even
[3:13:40.760 --> 3:13:46.120]  doing go away you're out because they're trying to cover up their corruption folks that you can
[3:13:46.120 --> 3:13:52.840]  never leave the game when you get into this swamp it is so deep and you are so involved
[3:13:52.840 --> 3:14:00.680]  that you have to cover and watch your back all day long that's how corrupt this government
[3:14:00.680 --> 3:14:07.960]  has become folks and we the people who want nothing of this corruption have nothing to do with this
[3:14:07.960 --> 3:14:13.960]  nothing to do with this corruption are being divided and conquered by the very people who are
[3:14:13.960 --> 3:14:19.960]  indeed the most corrupt so i just wanted to point that out and you know here's one of the big
[3:14:19.960 --> 3:14:29.960]  dividers it's about sex and gender now everybody's heard about the bill nye the science this is the
[3:14:29.960 --> 3:14:34.760]  fake science guy now but here's what here's a point that i'm not really hearing people talk about
[3:14:34.760 --> 3:14:38.360]  and i want to kind of paint an overall picture before i make this point first let's start with
[3:14:38.360 --> 3:14:42.040]  a story from the washington post a few days ago mark dice just did a video on this today
[3:14:42.040 --> 3:14:50.040]  don't laugh i have a serious reason for raising my cats gender neutral yeah the serious reason
[3:14:50.040 --> 3:14:55.400]  would be you have serious mental disorders but she she's telling a story about her cats and how
[3:14:55.400 --> 3:15:00.920]  she doesn't want to offend them with certain pronouns and she talks about part of the story
[3:15:00.920 --> 3:15:06.520]  how she goes to the vet and it's such a complicated process going to the vet because she doesn't know
[3:15:06.520 --> 3:15:12.360]  what to tell the vet is it a guy is it a girl is it this she doesn't want to have any microaggressions
[3:15:12.360 --> 3:15:18.120]  with the vet and it's just a very confusing very concocted experience very difficult at the vet
[3:15:18.120 --> 3:15:24.920]  to get her her cats taken care of and i'm just sitting here thinking don't you see how this
[3:15:24.920 --> 3:15:32.200]  how this will infiltrate your daily life don't you see it's the same paradigm if a transsexual
[3:15:32.200 --> 3:15:38.520]  person goes to the hospital probably or or you don't want to you go to the hospital with say
[3:15:38.520 --> 3:15:43.160]  your son or daughter but you're so politically correct the doctor says is this a male or female
[3:15:43.160 --> 3:15:49.000]  oh i don't want to say male or female it's just a person now you know it's it's a it's my five
[3:15:49.000 --> 3:15:55.080]  year old hasn't decided yet it might be male it might be female it might be pansexual i don't want
[3:15:55.080 --> 3:16:01.080]  to put anything on him or her so i don't know just you know doc i just don't know anymore it's
[3:16:01.080 --> 3:16:05.800]  going to get very convoluted and eventually the doctors are just going to say okay we're not
[3:16:05.800 --> 3:16:11.640]  dealing with you figure out if that's a male or a female okay and and then we'll we'll we'll deal
[3:16:11.640 --> 3:16:16.520]  with this and i was actually thinking about this they say cisgender privilege cisgender privilege
[3:16:16.520 --> 3:16:26.680]  think about this though everybody is cisgender everybody is born with either a penis or a vagina
[3:16:26.680 --> 3:16:30.360]  i guess there's what less than one percent of people that actually have some birth defect where
[3:16:30.360 --> 3:16:36.920]  they don't have a functioning one system of reproductive organs okay but guess what everybody's
[3:16:36.920 --> 3:16:42.360]  a cisgender if you choose not to be that's your choice and that's actually your privilege living
[3:16:42.360 --> 3:16:46.120]  in america so how do you like that but this person can't get their cats taken care of because
[3:16:46.120 --> 3:16:50.360]  they're so confused over their genders imagine what'll happen at a real hospital then you have
[3:16:50.360 --> 3:16:56.280]  this science march so get this though all of these people that get up and they're and they're
[3:16:56.280 --> 3:17:01.640]  giving their speeches i can't i don't know the exact numbers most of them got up there and talked
[3:17:01.640 --> 3:17:07.080]  about how they were gay talked about how they were transsexual talked about how genders are
[3:17:07.080 --> 3:17:14.520]  not binary nobody talked about science nobody talked about any discoveries they made any of
[3:17:14.520 --> 3:17:21.240]  their own accomplishments no it was just like look at me i'm a homosexual look at me i used to be a
[3:17:21.240 --> 3:17:26.920]  woman now i'm a man look at us we deserve to be heard we're in the field now we're scientists
[3:17:26.920 --> 3:17:34.760]  yay uh what did you accomplish well i became a man and i was a woman no in the field of science
[3:17:35.880 --> 3:17:39.560]  well actually i guess i mean tech i mean maybe these people are up there because they're a
[3:17:39.560 --> 3:17:47.240]  science project i mean i guess at one point you know changing your sex having sex a sex operation
[3:17:47.240 --> 3:17:52.680]  was actually a science project so yes i guess i guess maybe that's their accomplishment they
[3:17:52.680 --> 3:17:58.760]  are they were a science project that i guess was successful they now are different sex thanks to a
[3:17:58.760 --> 3:18:04.600]  surgery and so now they're a science project that gets to give a speech at the march for science
[3:18:04.600 --> 3:18:10.520]  that doesn't actually cover any science so that brings me to bill nye and i was just thinking
[3:18:10.520 --> 3:18:13.480]  about this the other day because i already covered this and i didn't even want to talk
[3:18:13.480 --> 3:18:16.600]  about it but the crew was like no you got to watch this video you got to respond to what
[3:18:16.600 --> 3:18:22.360]  everybody is so okay so i watched it and honestly the first time it's like it's almost like a good
[3:18:22.360 --> 3:18:27.720]  movie where you know the first time you see a good movie first maybe two times even you don't
[3:18:27.720 --> 3:18:31.400]  really get it there's still a lot of things you don't understand it just doesn't make sense to you
[3:18:31.400 --> 3:18:37.480]  but it was so it was so grasping you just had to watch it again that's how it was for me with this
[3:18:37.480 --> 3:18:42.120]  this weird video so so i didn't understand this video i'm watching it i'm just like what did i
[3:18:42.120 --> 3:18:47.000]  just watch this doesn't make any sense they didn't talk about anything really some woman just gets on
[3:18:47.000 --> 3:18:53.640]  stage and has some 80s rock outfit on and starts humping saying oh oh oh my sex junk okay so but
[3:18:53.640 --> 3:18:59.720]  here's my point i remember growing up with bill nye i remember bill nye the science guy i remember
[3:18:59.720 --> 3:19:05.480]  having bill nye the science guy videos played in my class folks it was actual science he actually
[3:19:05.480 --> 3:19:12.120]  talked about biology he actually talked about science he actually talked about real stuff now
[3:19:12.680 --> 3:19:20.200]  look at what your kids are learning in science class folks they're having opinion sexual based
[3:19:20.200 --> 3:19:25.800]  opinion shoved down your throats and they're calling it science because here's what's important
[3:19:25.800 --> 3:19:34.120]  to these people it's not science it's a political agenda see if it was about science they wouldn't
[3:19:34.120 --> 3:19:38.600]  get up on the stage at the science march and tell you they were gay they wouldn't get up at the
[3:19:38.600 --> 3:19:43.160]  science march and tell you that their accomplishment was how they were transgender and now they're
[3:19:43.160 --> 3:19:50.920]  in the field no they would talk to you about science this is the fourth hour of the alex joneshow
[3:19:50.920 --> 3:19:56.680]  we'll be right back on the other side don't go anywhere

[3:24:26.200 --> 3:24:35.480]  democrat run city you know there's no issues in democrat run cities i follow the democrats the
[3:24:35.480 --> 3:24:39.960]  democrats are on the podium all day long talking about how they want to help the poor build the
[3:24:39.960 --> 3:24:46.680]  inner cities build the education system i mean democrat run cities should be doing pretty well
[3:24:46.680 --> 3:24:55.160]  right no not the case is it and we've got the stories here to prove it pretty sad to be honest
[3:24:55.160 --> 3:25:03.000]  with you folks pretty sad here's one democrat run city this is a story from fox news baltimore
[3:25:03.000 --> 3:25:12.440]  tops 100 homicides so far in 2017 that's nice isn't it that's a nice democrat run city of baltimore
[3:25:12.440 --> 3:25:20.440]  of course this is the same city of baltimore where they had riots in the streets burning and looting
[3:25:22.200 --> 3:25:24.920]  because of an incident with a civilian and a police officer which hey
[3:25:26.600 --> 3:25:30.920]  yes if there's an incident with a police officer and a civilian and the police officer is out of
[3:25:30.920 --> 3:25:37.720]  line absolutely needs to be investigated needs to be justice completely agree burning and looting
[3:25:37.720 --> 3:25:46.280]  that's not justice that only hurts your cause but that's just a side note that's outside of the 100
[3:25:46.280 --> 3:25:53.800]  homicides the city of baltimore has suffered more than 100 homicides before the end of april
[3:25:53.800 --> 3:26:02.760]  for the first time in nearly 20 years you know what i should have looked this up i wonder
[3:26:02.760 --> 3:26:08.120]  probably about 20 years ago the last time there was a republican in office that's just a theory
[3:26:08.120 --> 3:26:14.040]  i'd have to look that up but i do know that baltimore is strong democrat they win them they
[3:26:14.040 --> 3:26:23.320]  put democrats in office year after year after year 100 homicides riots democrat run city folks
[3:26:23.320 --> 3:26:29.720]  that's what you get here's another democrat run city this is a story from cbs 1000 shooting victims
[3:26:29.720 --> 3:26:35.000]  in chicago this year so far how's that how are those gun bills working out
[3:26:36.280 --> 3:26:46.040]  hmm how is that anti-gun legislation working out chicago well let's see let's check the news today
[3:26:47.080 --> 3:26:54.680]  100 000 shooting victims in chicago this year oh failed didn't it failed so that's nice they call
[3:26:54.680 --> 3:27:05.560]  it shy rack you know that you know they call it shy rack the number hit 1000 on 2017's 115th day
[3:27:06.120 --> 3:27:14.120]  meaning that nearly nine people have been shot a day on average 174 victims have died
[3:27:14.120 --> 3:27:25.880]  shy rack run by democrats democrats pass gun legislation to try to keep the guns out of the
[3:27:25.880 --> 3:27:33.000]  hands of criminals of course what does that do it only keeps the guns out of the hands of law-abiding
[3:27:33.000 --> 3:27:39.960]  citizens doesn't it well that's not true we got the legislation it takes time to work
[3:27:39.960 --> 3:27:47.800]  really 1000 people shot 174 dead chicago you're gonna keep electing democrats you're gonna keep
[3:27:47.800 --> 3:27:56.760]  passing gun legislation good luck with that the democrats probably love this from abc news suspected
[3:27:56.760 --> 3:28:06.440]  arsonist in custody after two fires in trump hotel so now you've got people attacking trump
[3:28:06.440 --> 3:28:11.320]  towers and they want them they want to complain all this about donald trump
[3:28:12.200 --> 3:28:17.640]  look i'm not even let me it's just do you understand that life has not gotten easier for
[3:28:17.640 --> 3:28:23.880]  donald trump donald trump did not become president to make his life easier okay he can't even have
[3:28:23.880 --> 3:28:28.680]  towers now i bet his towers get threats every day to be honest with you i bet i bet they just
[3:28:28.680 --> 3:28:34.200]  probably don't report it but that's fine you know let's just let's just have a i hope these arsonists
[3:28:34.200 --> 3:28:37.880]  get arrested and it becomes a big news story i don't hear anybody talking about this this should
[3:28:37.880 --> 3:28:43.720]  be a big news story attacking trump towers attacking buildings arson in a bit that's you can
[3:28:43.720 --> 3:28:49.000]  consider this person a terrorist this is a politically driven event trying to burn trump tower

[3:33:55.240 --> 3:33:59.960]  half of caveman i go a little above okay i'm kind of a true caveman i need a little more perhaps
[3:33:59.960 --> 3:34:06.280]  so i do a scoop and a half of caveman two scoops peanut butter two scoops cold milled flask two
[3:34:06.280 --> 3:34:13.800]  bananas and uh just about i don't know how many cups probably about three cups of chocolate almond milk
[3:34:13.800 --> 3:34:19.000]  and then you're uh you're set you're good to go for the day and listen to all these nutrients that
[3:34:19.000 --> 3:34:25.080]  are in the bone broth that you're not getting most likely most people do not get these nutrients in
[3:34:25.080 --> 3:34:30.600]  their everyday diet turmeric root chaga mushroom bee pollen and bone broth those are four super
[3:34:30.600 --> 3:34:35.720]  nutrients that most people are not getting with their diets caveman knocks out all of those

[3:34:54.040 --> 3:35:00.680]  can use this for a post workout protein as well or if you're me use it for your morning shake with
[3:35:00.680 --> 3:35:06.280]  a couple bananas some peanut butter and some some flax it's good to go but bone broth right now take
[3:35:06.280 --> 3:35:13.880]  advantage of the special 53 off that is an absurd special so buy four of them before that deal is
[3:35:13.880 --> 3:35:19.720]  gone now if you're going to be out in berkeley you might want some caveman because you might have
[3:35:19.720 --> 3:35:26.440]  to try to caveman up on some of these antifa fascists in fact that's what they are that's
[3:35:26.440 --> 3:35:33.160]  what you call them instead of just antifa it's the antifa fascist so they've had milo events
[3:35:33.160 --> 3:35:38.360]  canceled they've had inculter events canceled these are the domestic terrorists by the way
[3:35:38.360 --> 3:35:48.360]  that are winning where's donald trump by the way excuse me but free speech is an important issue
[3:35:48.360 --> 3:35:56.120]  in this country in case you didn't notice it's the first amendment number one it's under attack
[3:35:56.120 --> 3:36:03.960]  president trump where are you evanka why are you thinking about syrian children it's very heartbreaking
[3:36:03.960 --> 3:36:12.840]  we're all very sad okay but guess what you're not the president of syria you're not the ambassador
[3:36:12.840 --> 3:36:21.800]  to syria you work for the united states of america and free speech is under attack right now
[3:36:21.800 --> 3:36:26.280]  i was thinking about this and i'm going to talk about this tonight on the nightly news but
[3:36:27.800 --> 3:36:34.600]  every media outlet in america every politician in america and to be honest with you probably every
[3:36:34.600 --> 3:36:41.160]  citizen but will stop at every politician should be outraged and speaking out about what is going
[3:36:41.160 --> 3:36:46.440]  on in berkeley right now it doesn't matter if you're a republican democrat independent green
[3:36:46.440 --> 3:36:53.560]  party left right up down yellow brown it doesn't matter this is all this is free speech under attack
[3:36:53.560 --> 3:37:02.840]  in america and we have media outlets that aren't even reporting on it or even worse that are justifying
[3:37:02.840 --> 3:37:11.400]  it yeah you know what as somebody that likes free speech as somebody that likes the ability to go out
[3:37:11.400 --> 3:37:16.680]  on the street and speak my mind and have a conversation with somebody you know what yeah it
[3:37:16.680 --> 3:37:23.400]  really grinds my gears when i see that free speech is under attack when i see that an colter
[3:37:23.400 --> 3:37:29.720]  and colter look if you want to say that mylo is offensive and you know what fine okay fine i i hate
[3:37:29.720 --> 3:37:34.200]  that that's ridiculous but i'll give you a pass there and colter what is an colter ever done
[3:37:36.120 --> 3:37:39.720]  what is the meanest thing that an colter what is the most offensive thing that an colter has ever
[3:37:39.720 --> 3:37:43.400]  said what predicting trump would be president before anybody else and getting laughed at
[3:37:43.400 --> 3:37:52.600]  oh we need to stop that oh no can't have an colter here that's antifa which stands for anti fascist
[3:37:52.600 --> 3:37:57.960]  but see here's the problem with antifa they didn't go to class did they they're probably all college
[3:37:57.960 --> 3:38:03.880]  dropouts they never went to class in high school so they didn't study history they didn't study history
[3:38:03.880 --> 3:38:11.880]  they don't realize that they're actually behaving like fascists and again every media outlet from
[3:38:11.880 --> 3:38:20.600]  cnn to info wars from huffington post to breitbart should have this as the as i mean i understand
[3:38:20.600 --> 3:38:25.640]  you know we're in a cold world war right now but still as far as domestic news is concerned i
[3:38:25.640 --> 3:38:30.840]  understand we all want taxes i understand people are obsessed with the wall okay but free speech
[3:38:30.840 --> 3:38:37.800]  is under attack folks what do you think would have happened in fact it's probably still gonna happen
[3:38:37.800 --> 3:38:41.960]  but what do you think would have happened if an colter would have had her her event tonight
[3:38:42.520 --> 3:38:47.240]  would have been the same thing that happened at the milo event burning breaking things
[3:38:48.600 --> 3:38:55.080]  a whole scene terrorists roaming in the street covering their faces throwing fireworks smashing
[3:38:55.080 --> 3:39:02.680]  windows great work berkeley the freedom that the center of free speech isn't it
[3:39:03.720 --> 3:39:10.360]  we're free speech apparently was um a bastion of free speech uc berkeley no but it but it's not
[3:39:10.360 --> 3:39:15.800]  just berkeley portland rose parade canceled after anti fascist threatened gop marchers
[3:39:17.880 --> 3:39:24.600]  explain to me how this is not terrorism i'd like to hear that i'd like to hear robert
[3:39:24.600 --> 3:39:29.480]  rish explain to me how this is not terrorism
[3:39:31.240 --> 3:39:38.040]  threatening violence for a political purpose terrorism portland rose parade canceled after
[3:39:38.040 --> 3:39:48.520]  anti fascist threatened gop marchers terrorists if you replace the the term anti fascists in
[3:39:48.520 --> 3:39:54.840]  all of these stories with terrorists it still makes sense yeah there you go organizers cancel
[3:39:54.840 --> 3:40:00.360]  82nd avenue of roses parade after protesters threatened to shut it down wait a second hold on
[3:40:00.360 --> 3:40:07.880]  guys go down in this story i didn't realize that pull that story back up i'm not i'm not from organ
[3:40:07.880 --> 3:40:13.960]  okay is this a chinese festival does anybody actually know is this like a chinese heritage
[3:40:13.960 --> 3:40:18.680]  festival the pictures that i'm seeing right now appear to be uh there seems to be some
[3:40:18.680 --> 3:40:22.040]  asian influence there but okay now they're showing me more pictures perhaps now there's
[3:40:22.040 --> 3:40:26.280]  some more it looks like so i don't really know but it looks like a multicultural event
[3:40:27.080 --> 3:40:36.680]  so this is actually racist what okay so because the gop wants to have marchers in this multicultural
[3:40:36.680 --> 3:40:41.960]  parade they're going to shut it down because the anti fascists are going to attack the gop
[3:40:41.960 --> 3:40:53.640]  marchers so you see this again where is the president where is trump i mean again this is
[3:40:53.640 --> 3:40:59.320]  domestic terrorism here these are people threatening violence for a political purpose
[3:41:00.840 --> 3:41:10.120]  nothing nothing we've got people that we're actually looking at as suspected terrorists
[3:41:10.120 --> 3:41:18.120]  i'm imagining radical islamic terrorists in 50 states we're looking at people in 50 states right
[3:41:18.120 --> 3:41:24.120]  now because they could become radicalized terrorists but we're ignoring the terrorists
[3:41:24.120 --> 3:41:28.920]  that are roaming the streets in berkeley california and and apparently in portland organ
[3:41:28.920 --> 3:41:35.000]  we're ignoring those terrorists aren't we and then these same people see these are the same people
[3:41:35.000 --> 3:41:39.400]  they want a bitch about american privilege when it's their american privilege that allows them
[3:41:39.400 --> 3:41:46.280]  to go be terrorists in the streets how do you like that let me ask you this
[3:41:48.840 --> 3:41:57.320]  if instead of mostly white college aged men that dropped out of college and don't have a job and
[3:41:57.320 --> 3:42:05.480]  live with their parents that make up the antifa party let's just say instead it was the same aged
[3:42:05.480 --> 3:42:13.000]  men except they were from middle eastern descent and they were muslim and they chanted alahu akbar
[3:42:13.000 --> 3:42:19.400]  while they shut down free speech in america how do you think that would go over oh my goodness well
[3:42:19.400 --> 3:42:24.200]  we'd be right on top of that now wouldn't we that would be the biggest issue that would be terrorist
[3:42:24.200 --> 3:42:32.440]  on our streets well they're already there they might not be wearing a hijab they might not be
[3:42:32.440 --> 3:42:39.480]  having the the typical muslim beard but they're out there they might not be chanting alahu akbar
[3:42:39.480 --> 3:42:45.640]  they might not be shooting people yet but they're out there they're shutting down free speech they
[3:42:45.640 --> 3:42:58.280]  are political terrorists why do they get to operate it's the same old question imagine if it was the
[3:42:58.280 --> 3:43:05.240]  other way around imagine if it was trump supporters that if hillary clinton i mean what chelsea clinton
[3:43:05.240 --> 3:43:10.600]  just received another award are you even aware of this chelsea clinton is receiving awards hand
[3:43:10.600 --> 3:43:17.000]  over fist for what nobody knows chelsea clinton just receives another award imagine if the alt right
[3:43:18.040 --> 3:43:24.440]  or bright bart supporters or info warriors were out at chelsea clinton's event protesting there you
[3:43:24.440 --> 3:43:31.560]  go chelsea clinton gets another award for doing nothing she has to be the most awarded nothing
[3:43:31.560 --> 3:43:37.880]  in in the history of the world i mean for real what has she done
[3:43:41.000 --> 3:43:47.720]  did they they may have actually they may have designed the donkey from shrek after her the
[3:43:47.720 --> 3:43:52.520]  donkey from shrek may have been inspired by chelsea clinton so she might have that going for
[3:43:52.520 --> 3:43:58.040]  but so she gets another award if we were out there protesting it would be an uproar msnbc
[3:43:58.040 --> 3:44:06.040]  would be throwing fits cnn's van jones would be calling it a white lash but when it's the
[3:44:06.040 --> 3:44:11.000]  antifa protesters when it's liberals when it's leftist when you want to shut down conservative
[3:44:11.000 --> 3:44:19.880]  speech that's okay that that just flies right by with cnn and the liberal media but just imagine
[3:44:19.880 --> 3:44:26.360]  though just imagine if you added a beard and a hijab to those antifa marchers how would you
[3:44:26.360 --> 3:44:31.880]  think of it how would that look same activity you don't have to change the activity they're
[3:44:31.880 --> 3:44:37.320]  already burning stuff down they're already riding just put them in some middle eastern
[3:44:37.320 --> 3:44:41.960]  garb see how that would go over how much you want to bet they would be arrested immediately
[3:44:43.400 --> 3:44:47.080]  oh but because of their american privilege that they have a big problem with they get to go out
[3:44:47.080 --> 3:44:52.120]  and do it how do you like that so the very american privilege that they bitch and moan about
[3:44:52.840 --> 3:44:57.080]  is the very privilege that's actually keeping them all from being arrested and put in jail
[3:44:57.080 --> 3:45:03.080]  where they belong but that's fine their time is coming to an end folks it's not gonna last
[3:45:04.840 --> 3:45:11.320]  but the war of the war on fox is not stopping lawyer who represented o'reilly's hot chocolate
[3:45:11.320 --> 3:45:19.000]  accuser is now targeting jesse waters and the sad thing about this folks yeah lisa bloom
[3:45:20.680 --> 3:45:26.760]  yeah you're you're you're real good for society lisa bloom but the interesting thing about this is
[3:45:26.760 --> 3:45:33.320]  all they have to do is just put this into the mainstream talking points it doesn't even matter
[3:45:33.320 --> 3:45:39.000]  jesse waters could have not even harmed or talked to a fly but all they have to do is push this out
[3:45:39.000 --> 3:45:44.440]  there all the liberal attorneys have to do is push this story out there and then it's it's in the
[3:45:44.440 --> 3:45:49.880]  narrative then it's out there and then it becomes the echo chamber of the left i couldn't i couldn't
[3:45:49.880 --> 3:45:57.400]  even believe all the liberals on twitter i saw blowing up about this oh it's fox sexual harassment
[3:45:57.400 --> 3:46:02.040]  fox oh there was white men at fox this is nothing and i'm just sitting here scratching my head like
[3:46:02.040 --> 3:46:08.120]  you really don't get it do you you really don't get it this has nothing to do with sexual harassment
[3:46:08.120 --> 3:46:16.280]  at fox this has to do with silencing conservative news but see you wouldn't get that because according
[3:46:16.280 --> 3:46:21.480]  to these brainwashed liberals we live in a rape culture already but here's the point i keep bringing
[3:46:21.480 --> 3:46:29.240]  up anyway do you are you really that naive that you think sexual harassment this this sexual
[3:46:29.240 --> 3:46:36.760]  harassment is only going on at fox are you really that naive of all of the big news corporations
[3:46:36.760 --> 3:46:44.440]  out there it's only happening at fox fox is the only one i mean it might not be you know bill
[3:46:44.440 --> 3:46:51.320]  o'reilly calling uh a woman hot chocolate maybe it's cnn it's you know jake tapper making a a
[3:46:51.320 --> 3:46:56.200]  little remark towards uh anderson cooper in the kitchen if you catch my drift with that one
[3:46:56.200 --> 3:47:03.400]  you know maybe a little tie joke but this goes on okay but they're pointing at fox because don't
[3:47:03.400 --> 3:47:11.960]  you see well fox probably helped trump get in so we have to stop fox we can't we can't be letting
[3:47:11.960 --> 3:47:19.000]  these conservatives on fox determine the outcome of a us election i mean god forbid that americans
[3:47:19.000 --> 3:47:24.120]  actually determine their own election and while they just did we're going to blame russia anyway
[3:47:25.400 --> 3:47:30.120]  but we'll get to more on that in a minute but here you go they want to point out actually
[3:47:30.120 --> 3:47:35.400]  we'll get to this right now they're going to point out collusion all day long right trump russia
[3:47:35.400 --> 3:47:40.520]  flinn russia russia russia collusion collusion we'll find the collusion maxine waters is going
[3:47:40.520 --> 3:47:45.080]  to be digging for years until she finds some some collusion she will find it she promises you
[3:47:45.880 --> 3:47:53.240]  she may find her a new wig before that but here's the collusion you want to talk collusion
[3:47:54.120 --> 3:47:59.000]  meanwhile with zero actual proof of russia trump collusion at least in the aspect of trying to win
[3:47:59.000 --> 3:48:04.040]  the election russia trying to win trump the election here's the real collusion folks and
[3:48:04.040 --> 3:48:11.960]  here's the lingering presidency of barack obama just lingering sanctuary city's fight judge who
[3:48:11.960 --> 3:48:20.120]  blocked trump order a democrat activists how do you like that so you've got an obama judge a
[3:48:20.120 --> 3:48:29.320]  liberal judge a democrat who is now blocking the president did you did you elect judge william
[3:48:29.320 --> 3:48:36.040]  orrick the third did you vote for judge william orrick the third i'll do you one better have
[3:48:36.040 --> 3:48:46.760]  you ever heard of judge william orrick the third let me tell you my name is john william orrick
[3:48:46.760 --> 3:48:53.960]  the third and even though i was not elected by the american people i am more important than
[3:48:53.960 --> 3:49:04.200]  donald trump and if donald trump thinks that he can pass this racist legislation against sanctuary
[3:49:04.200 --> 3:49:17.400]  cities i judge william orrick the third 63 years old i will strike that down because don't you see i
[3:49:17.400 --> 3:49:24.040]  judge william orrick the third and actually not the judge in the united states of america you think
[3:49:24.040 --> 3:49:37.800]  i am no i am a judge for non-citizens yes my paycheck is paid for by the us tax payer but i
[3:49:37.800 --> 3:49:47.800]  judge william orrick the third have instead the non-citizen in mind so now you will pay me judge
[3:49:47.800 --> 3:49:57.560]  william orrick the third and i will fight for the non-citizen because that's how i work i am a liberal
[3:49:57.560 --> 3:50:08.200]  judge judge william orrick the third and quite simply to me a non-citizen is more important
[3:50:08.200 --> 3:50:15.640]  than a citizen a non-citizen's right is more important than a citizen's right and if you
[3:50:15.640 --> 3:50:26.200]  disagree with me or if you like president trump you are a racist because i judge william orrick
[3:50:26.200 --> 3:50:36.680]  the third said so there i am my tie has been tied a little too tight for the last 20 years
[3:50:36.680 --> 3:50:43.480]  but that's okay because i am a liberal judge we're going to liberalize this country

[3:54:10.760 --> 3:54:16.360]  not trump and russia no in fact it's the democrats who are colluding against president trump against
[3:54:16.360 --> 3:54:22.280]  president trump's agenda which is actually our agenda so we've got democrats and judges colluding
[3:54:22.280 --> 3:54:27.480]  against the republic colluding against the american people they ought to be well they probably ought
[3:54:27.480 --> 3:54:32.120]  to be fired a bit honestly maybe even i mean i don't know you'd have to look into some different
[3:54:32.840 --> 3:54:39.400]  litigation techniques here but um they could even be jailable at this point because you're
[3:54:39.400 --> 3:54:46.200]  putting people in danger who's going to be held responsible if these democrats continue to collude
[3:54:46.200 --> 3:54:53.640]  to keep borders open and to keep sanctuary cities funded and and alive and well when these if in a
[3:54:53.640 --> 3:54:59.320]  if a non-citizen murder somebody in a sanctuary city who do you hold accountable how about judge
[3:54:59.320 --> 3:55:05.080]  william orc the third he's fighting for these sanctuary cities someone ought to be held accountable
[3:55:05.080 --> 3:55:12.280]  but meanwhile as the democrats are colluding here against the republic in america perhaps what i'm
[3:55:12.280 --> 3:55:20.440]  dubbing a cold world war has started or war chicken has started uh let's finish off the show today
[3:55:20.440 --> 3:55:25.240]  just covering some of these headlines that developed um after i cut the hot topic talking
[3:55:25.240 --> 3:55:31.080]  about all the headlines that developed over the week us pressure could force britain to join
[3:55:31.080 --> 3:55:41.160]  anti Assad airstrikes suggests boris johnson so now you're looking at the uk joining the us in
[3:55:41.160 --> 3:55:47.640]  bringing down Assad it's funny i don't hear the democrats colluding or the democrats
[3:55:47.640 --> 3:55:54.520]  crying collusion on that do you you don't hear the democrats crying about the united states
[3:55:55.160 --> 3:56:01.160]  meddling in syrian politics do you with all the proof in the world in front of their face no with
[3:56:01.160 --> 3:56:04.440]  no proof they want to complain about russia meddling in our politics even though there's
[3:56:04.440 --> 3:56:09.480]  more proof of hillary and the democrats doing that than russia no this is the world i live in now
[3:56:09.480 --> 3:56:17.080]  where we're now colluding in fact with the uk or britain to try to take Assad out but the democrats
[3:56:17.080 --> 3:56:24.760]  are silent democrats are silent in fact everyone was silent on this israel strikes damascus airport
[3:56:24.760 --> 3:56:33.240]  today didn't hear anybody reporting this on american television news nothing an israeli
[3:56:33.240 --> 3:56:38.840]  missile strike has caused a large explosion and a fire at a military site near damascus
[3:56:38.840 --> 3:56:44.680]  international airport syrian state media reports and this report surfaced around so
[3:56:45.240 --> 3:56:50.680]  so that's nice the us is trying to work in regime change in syria israel is trying to work in a
[3:56:50.680 --> 3:56:54.840]  regime change in syria now they're trying to pressure britain and probably other members of
[3:56:54.840 --> 3:56:59.480]  uk and europe to get involved in this regime change as well and this is just part of the
[3:56:59.480 --> 3:57:05.400]  overall geopolitical world war that's cold war war that's being built but the democrats don't care
[3:57:05.400 --> 3:57:11.400]  because they're still all looking up each other's rear ends for russia collusion yes that's great
[3:57:11.400 --> 3:57:15.800]  let's let's pile drive through a couple more of these headlines north korea loses millions under
[3:57:15.800 --> 3:57:21.960]  pressure from china so this is more of what people are going to suspect is a result of trump's
[3:57:22.760 --> 3:57:28.120]  brinksmanship and trump making deals with china to try to help remove the north korean dictator
[3:57:28.120 --> 3:57:33.240]  and now north korea is losing cold deals i think they're being hit with gas deals now too and
[3:57:33.240 --> 3:57:38.200]  they're losing millions under pressure from china north korea strikes white house a new video so we
[3:57:38.200 --> 3:57:42.360]  already had the video of them apparently launching a strike on to america now they got a new one
[3:57:43.320 --> 3:57:48.920]  hitting the white house how sweet is that that's that's very nice that that north korea would do
[3:57:48.920 --> 3:57:57.160]  that china to conduct live fire drills test new weapons in response to fad that's nice so you got
