[00:00.000 --> 00:14.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.160 --> 00:27.480]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones welcome to the Alex Jones show
[00:27.480 --> 00:35.000]  on this Monday October 26 2015 I'm David Knight your host we have a host of news we have the
[00:35.000 --> 00:42.120]  IRS now having their own stingray cell phones this has been something that's been done by a lot
[00:42.120 --> 00:47.720]  of different agencies and of course whenever they do it they do it secretly because they
[00:47.720 --> 00:52.280]  don't want the citizens to know about it I remember we had a story about a year year and a
[00:52.280 --> 00:58.360]  half ago there was a local police department had used stingray to illegally search people without
[00:58.360 --> 01:03.320]  a warrant and of course stingray is an electronic device whereby they can grab your cell phone
[01:03.320 --> 01:08.840]  location and other information without getting a search warrant and they're not supposed to do
[01:08.840 --> 01:14.360]  that they had a situation where they had apprehended someone who was involved in alleged theft and
[01:14.360 --> 01:19.560]  when he came before the judge the judge said well how did you acquire this information and they said
[01:19.560 --> 01:26.680]  well we can't tell you judge we have a non-disclosure agreement and he said you don't have a non-disclosure
[01:26.680 --> 01:32.120]  agreement with me said how did you get this information so they huddled together and they
[01:32.120 --> 01:37.480]  said never mind we're going to drop the charges they've done everything they can to try to hide
[01:37.480 --> 01:44.600]  this illegal snooping using stingray now we find out that the 13th agency we've had 12 different
[01:44.600 --> 01:52.280]  agencies that have been exposed to be doing this a 13th agency is now the IRS doing this yes it is
[01:52.280 --> 01:58.200]  total information awareness total surveillance by every bureaucracy you can imagine all of them
[01:58.200 --> 02:03.400]  arming themselves with weapons all of them arming themselves with listening devices to spy upon you
[02:04.040 --> 02:07.560]  that's the kind of government we're looking at right now so we're going to break
[02:08.440 --> 02:12.280]  into what's going on with that and of course just this last week the end of last week
[02:12.280 --> 02:19.000]  they passed CISA the cyber security information sharing act this is something that is supposed
[02:19.000 --> 02:26.440]  to allow them to get provide legal protection for corporations who turn over information to them
[02:26.440 --> 02:31.960]  because they don't want to give the corporations any excuse to deny turning this information over
[02:31.960 --> 02:36.120]  to them so they guys they don't worry you're protected but you better turn it over it's also
[02:36.120 --> 02:42.280]  a way of giving legal protection and legal cover to something that's been going on for quite a while
[02:42.280 --> 02:47.400]  we see a lot of tech companies a lot of them who have been collaborators quizlings for the
[02:47.400 --> 02:52.520]  surveillance state saying oh we don't want to do this when in reality they really want the
[02:52.520 --> 02:57.080]  liability protection is really all that they want but there are some who really don't want to do it
[02:57.080 --> 03:02.040]  and that has been one of the issues that they've been able to use saying if we were to do this we
[03:02.040 --> 03:08.920]  would be betraying the privacy concerns of our customers but this is how the government has been
[03:08.920 --> 03:14.200]  rolling this out for quite some time saying that the information that the phone company collects
[03:14.200 --> 03:18.280]  that your internet service provider collects that anybody that you deal with anyone that collects
[03:18.280 --> 03:24.760]  any information on you that's no longer your information so turn it over because you don't
[03:24.760 --> 03:30.120]  want us to play rough with you if you're the phone company you know we give you a monopoly a nice
[03:30.120 --> 03:35.480]  monopoly a nice lucrative monopoly we're going to look at some minority report pre-crime ways that
[03:35.480 --> 03:38.920]  this information is being used here if you don't think that it's really going to be used against
[03:38.920 --> 03:45.400]  americans understand of course it already is we just had the IRS given a free reign by the
[03:45.400 --> 03:53.240]  department of justice quote unquote this last week saying that there wasn't any malice with this or
[03:53.240 --> 03:58.840]  wasn't a political targeting of this of course there was if there wasn't any malice or political
[03:58.840 --> 04:04.840]  targeting it would have been done across the political spectrum it wasn't it was focused on
[04:04.840 --> 04:09.320]  conservative groups and they said this isn't happening well it is still going on there are
[04:09.320 --> 04:15.560]  still tea parties tea party organizations that have had their paperwork held up for years many of
[04:15.560 --> 04:20.280]  them have still not gotten that information we're also going to cover some information about what's
[04:20.280 --> 04:27.320]  going on with paul rhino the person who is seems to be the choice for the next speaker of the house
[04:27.320 --> 04:32.200]  someone who is going to be able to work with obama be acceptable to john bainer because he's going
[04:32.200 --> 04:36.680]  to give them everything that they want we're going to take a look at that also some news on open
[04:36.680 --> 04:42.840]  borders and what's it tells us about the collapsing globalist social estate we'll be right back stay
[04:42.840 --> 04:58.760]  with us
[04:58.760 --> 05:04.280]  hey daniels info wars dot com did you know that half of all americans make less than 30 000 a year
[05:04.280 --> 05:09.720]  new government data also reveals that 40 americans are making less than 20 000 annually which is well
[05:09.720 --> 05:14.760]  below the poverty level for a family of four and according to the daily caller this new data doesn't
[05:14.760 --> 05:19.560]  take into account the eight million americans who are unemployed or the tens of millions americans who
[05:19.560 --> 05:24.360]  gave up trying to find a job in fact we're now experiencing the lowest participation rate since
[05:24.360 --> 05:30.200]  1977 this means that america's middle class is systematically being destroyed and this is intentional
[05:30.200 --> 05:35.480]  nicole macchiavelli a 16th century pioneer on statescraft once said that it was in the government's
[05:35.480 --> 05:40.280]  best interest to keep its citizens poor but why well if the middle class disappears we're going to
[05:40.280 --> 05:44.840]  have a huge income gap in america between the ultra elite who hold most of the government power
[05:44.840 --> 05:49.320]  and the dirt poor who are too impoverished to stop the expanse of government at the expense of their

[08:23.640 --> 08:33.320]  jones welcome to the alex jones show on this monday october 26 2015 i'm david night your host
[08:34.200 --> 08:41.160]  we're going to be talking in the third hour to zoltan istvan is a candidate for presidency
[08:41.160 --> 08:45.400]  with the transhumanist party a party that he created so we're going to talk to him about
[08:45.400 --> 08:50.680]  his goals for transhumanism what he thinks that's about should be an interesting interview he's
[08:50.680 --> 08:55.560]  going to be here live in the studio third hour before we get to that i want to talk about
[08:56.680 --> 09:03.480]  the out of control use of technology by our government of course we learned last week at
[09:03.480 --> 09:07.480]  the end of the week that the department of justice was not going to target lowest learner
[09:08.440 --> 09:13.080]  maybe it's because they think that she's uh related to a girlfriend of superman i don't know
[09:13.080 --> 09:18.680]  but it looks like she's got more powerful friends than superman she's got powerful people in the
[09:18.680 --> 09:24.760]  government and we were told at the time that you know it was just bureaucratic incompetence well if
[09:24.760 --> 09:31.160]  it was bureaucratic incompetence it would affect groups equally across the political spectrum this
[09:31.160 --> 09:39.000]  was targeted on conservative groups on tea party groups and now we learn that they are still targeting
[09:39.000 --> 09:43.960]  tea party groups this isn't something that has gone on that has stopped the washington times
[09:43.960 --> 09:47.880]  reports that the irs is still holding up the nonprofit applications for tea party groups
[09:47.880 --> 09:54.760]  including one that has been waiting nearly six years for approval as i say it's no wonder so many
[09:54.760 --> 09:59.560]  americans have had it with washington and the elite political class who can get away with something
[09:59.560 --> 10:05.080]  like this says mark mechler president of citizens for self-governance one of the organizers of the
[10:05.080 --> 10:09.880]  class action lawsuit yet another case is pending before federal appeals court after tea party
[10:09.880 --> 10:15.560]  challengers lost at the district court level where the judge ruled that the irs targeted
[10:15.560 --> 10:20.920]  targeting rather stopped in 2013 so there was no longer a case to be decided and yet that's not
[10:20.920 --> 10:26.280]  the case they say that was news that it's stopped two years ago that's news to the albuquerque tea
[10:26.280 --> 10:33.880]  party which applied for nonprofit status back in december of 2009 and is still waiting for approval
[10:34.520 --> 10:40.360]  and also another one of the center's clients unite and action an ohio group has been waiting for more
[10:40.360 --> 10:44.680]  than three years for approval so one is in new mexico another one is in ohio but of course
[10:44.680 --> 10:52.600]  there's no coordination by the central uh offices of the irs that's precisely what was going on
[10:52.600 --> 10:58.520]  we all know what's going on and we all know that the people in power continually get away with
[10:58.520 --> 11:05.160]  committing crimes because simply they are in power jciculo one of the chief councils for the american
[11:05.160 --> 11:09.880]  center for law and justice that is challenging this says it's an outrage a mockery of justice yes
[11:09.880 --> 11:15.640]  it's a mockery of the rule of law and it's something that we have come to see everywhere
[11:15.640 --> 11:19.720]  look at this article from the guardian not only is the irs targeting tea party groups
[11:19.720 --> 11:25.560]  and getting away with it but now they're acquiring stingray cell phone surveillance gear actually
[11:25.560 --> 11:29.960]  this has been going on for quite some time going back to the time when they were holding up guess
[11:29.960 --> 11:37.560]  what status to attack status for tea party groups going back to the same years 2009 2012 under the
[11:37.560 --> 11:43.960]  freedom of information act they have found this is a guardian investigation they found documents
[11:43.960 --> 11:48.920]  for purchases make made six years ago when they started this targeting of the tea party they also
[11:48.920 --> 11:54.440]  started collecting stingray devices as i mentioned in the last segment this is something that the
[11:54.440 --> 12:01.960]  fbi has worked very hard to keep quiet many law enforcement agencies will tell the judge they
[12:01.960 --> 12:06.600]  have a nondisclosure agreement and they will refuse to reveal how they got this information
[12:06.600 --> 12:10.520]  if the judge challenges them and says where's your search warrant well you know i just have this
[12:10.520 --> 12:14.280]  stuff but of course there's other ways that they can do this we know that for many years the
[12:14.280 --> 12:19.240]  drug enforcement agency and others have illegally collected information the nsa would collect
[12:19.240 --> 12:23.800]  information illegally pass it to the dea they would use parallel construction to pretend
[12:23.800 --> 12:29.160]  that they had acquired this with a search warrant but now they're not really even bothering with
[12:29.160 --> 12:34.600]  that beard they just go out and violate the law with impunity and it's going to get worse and
[12:34.600 --> 12:38.680]  we'll tell you how it's going to get worse but first this situation they say privacy advocates
[12:38.680 --> 12:45.240]  say the revelation quote shows the wide proliferation of this very invasive surveillance technology
[12:45.240 --> 12:51.800]  despite their extensive capabilities in these stingray devices they require only a low level
[12:51.800 --> 12:57.960]  court order called a pen register it's also known as a trap and trace in order to grant
[12:57.960 --> 13:03.800]  permission for their use very similar to what's going on with the nsa when they say that they're
[13:03.800 --> 13:11.320]  going to they get this massive broad search warrant as ran paul put it going before the
[13:11.320 --> 13:17.400]  fiza court and saying i want a search warrant for mr and mrs verizon in which case the fiza court
[13:17.400 --> 13:23.480]  says sure you can listen to anybody that has a verizon account oh i'd like one for mr mrs atnt
[13:23.480 --> 13:29.720]  as well yeah no problem sure no no no problem with that we can do dragnet surveillance of everybody
[13:29.720 --> 13:33.720]  in the united states and it's going to get worse i'll tell you about that in just a moment
[13:33.720 --> 13:38.520]  various revelations by the aclu and other news outlets including the guardian have shown at least
[13:38.520 --> 13:45.080]  12 federal agencies already known to have these devices including the nsa the fbi now the irs
[13:45.080 --> 13:51.720]  makes 13 a baker's dozen yes they harass our people and they eat out their substance that's
[13:51.720 --> 13:57.800]  the nature of government if it's not controlled government is always either at your feet or at
[13:57.800 --> 14:04.280]  your throat let me ask you do you think it's at your feet no it's not so where are they going
[14:04.280 --> 14:08.920]  next with us well the next thing that they're doing is greasing the skids giving themselves some
[14:08.920 --> 14:15.560]  legal cover saying that they will they're going to pass sissa this is something that they've tried
[14:15.560 --> 14:21.240]  for multiple times they called it syspa and now it is called sysa and they're getting it through
[14:21.240 --> 14:26.520]  nothing has really changed except dropping the p for protection this is a cyber security information
[14:26.520 --> 14:31.960]  sharing act it used to be the cyber security information sharing protection act and i guess
[14:31.960 --> 14:36.440]  maybe people said well who's getting protected by this because this isn't something that is
[14:36.440 --> 14:40.600]  increasing the protection of individuals you're spying on us you're collecting our information
[14:40.600 --> 14:46.360]  it's like oh well it's there the p is there to protect companies from being sued by you when
[14:46.360 --> 14:53.160]  they violate your privacy you know that other p word that they don't like that p word that's
[14:53.160 --> 14:58.040]  getting banned by the government this has now been passed by the senate they just need to reconcile
[14:58.040 --> 15:03.880]  it with the house obama has indicated that he will sign it of course he will he will not uh
[15:03.880 --> 15:09.640]  shy away from any kind of surveillance he said we would have the most transparent administration
[15:09.640 --> 15:15.160]  we had ever seen that's what obama told everybody little did you realize that the transparency
[15:15.160 --> 15:22.120]  was going to be on you not on him everything they do is a secret we have a state religion
[15:22.120 --> 15:27.640]  of national security everything is sacrificed to it your privacy the rule of law the bill
[15:27.640 --> 15:33.080]  of rights the constitution but they will not tell you anything about what they're doing
[15:33.080 --> 15:36.600]  we've had this trade agreement i think we're that was now three weeks ago they announced
[15:36.600 --> 15:41.320]  they had come up with this agreement we were told for a very long time that the corporations
[15:41.320 --> 15:47.240]  and the corporate law lobbyists who are working on this trade partnership quote unquote it's a treaty
[15:48.120 --> 15:51.640]  we were told that they couldn't tell us about this because that would just scotch the whole
[15:51.640 --> 15:55.880]  deal you know you can't uh go public as this thing is being negotiated we'll let you know once
[15:55.880 --> 16:00.520]  it's negotiated well here we are three weeks later maybe four i don't know the exact date but it's
[16:00.520 --> 16:07.560]  been at least three weeks we still don't have any information from our corporate masters as to what
[16:07.560 --> 16:13.160]  they're about to do we do know that it's going to be far more than free trade it is going to reorganize
[16:13.160 --> 16:17.960]  copyright it's going to reorganize national sovereignty it is going to elevate corporations
[16:17.960 --> 16:22.600]  to the level of government which of course they are aren't they if they can tell our congressmen
[16:22.600 --> 16:28.680]  and senators that they cannot talk about what's going on with this agreement because they have
[16:29.240 --> 16:33.160]  a to sign a non-disclosure agreement there's that non-disclosure agreement again right
[16:34.280 --> 16:40.360]  indias all over the place because we're operating in a corporate environment now we don't have a
[16:40.360 --> 16:46.440]  government anymore we have a multinational corporations are running this government so they
[16:46.440 --> 16:52.120]  deal on non-disclosure agreements and everything that they do is secret they say although sissa is
[16:52.120 --> 16:58.760]  branded a cyber security bill this is from info world and of course this is a tech organization
[16:58.760 --> 17:04.040]  this is not a political organization this is a technical organization info world they say although
[17:04.040 --> 17:09.080]  sissa is branded a cyber security bill it does nothing to actually improve the effectiveness
[17:09.080 --> 17:14.280]  of security systems this is people who understand computers telling you this it's concerned instead
[17:14.280 --> 17:18.360]  with increasing the amount of information the corporations share with government and protecting
[17:18.360 --> 17:24.600]  those companies from liability for violating a customer's privacy yeah again like i said it's
[17:24.600 --> 17:28.920]  going to legitimize it but it will also put pressure on some of the companies that have been
[17:28.920 --> 17:34.840]  reluctant to turn this over saying we would experience legal issues we would be sued by
[17:34.840 --> 17:38.920]  customers if we do this because they didn't want to turn that information over they didn't want
[17:38.920 --> 17:45.160]  to violate your privacy now the government will use sissa as a club against these holdouts telling
[17:45.160 --> 17:49.960]  them no you don't have any liability so you don't have any reason not to give that information to
[17:49.960 --> 17:54.760]  me hand it over that's the way they're going to use this and of course they point out that the
[17:54.760 --> 17:59.880]  cyber intelligence sharing and protection act syspo was introduced back in 2011 it failed
[17:59.880 --> 18:06.200]  it was reintroduced in 2013 it was failed again last year any mention of protection was stripped
[18:06.200 --> 18:13.160]  out and they have now pushed this thing through and of course erin schwarz worked very hard to defeat
[18:13.160 --> 18:17.800]  that i would say that he gave his life to defeat that i don't believe that he killed himself in
[18:17.800 --> 18:22.200]  desperation that's the official narrative from the government uh people who knew him
[18:23.240 --> 18:27.960]  said they were absolutely blindsided by this how many times do we have to have someone
[18:27.960 --> 18:32.600]  that the government tells us committed suicide in prison or whatever how many times does that have
[18:32.600 --> 18:38.600]  to happen and they're all saying hey i'm fine i'm fighting this to the end blah blah and everybody
[18:38.600 --> 18:42.920]  that they know says they were well adjusted they were a fighter they were going after this and then
[18:42.920 --> 18:50.120]  all of a sudden they commit suicide you know like gary webb or the dc madham or so many different
[18:50.120 --> 18:56.600]  people that we've talked to and of course erin schwarz was a fighter he picked this fight with
[18:56.600 --> 19:02.200]  them he wasn't shying away from this and although you had a prosecutor interestingly enough the
[19:02.200 --> 19:09.720]  same prosecutor carmen or tease who was involved in the subsequent boston bombing false flag even
[19:09.720 --> 19:15.800]  though carmen or tease was pushing him and publicly saying that they were going to try to put him in
[19:15.800 --> 19:20.600]  prison for 35 years the charges had been dropped by the university the charges had been dropped at
[19:20.600 --> 19:24.600]  the local level they said that's not anything he had removed some data it wasn't any any kind of a
[19:24.600 --> 19:30.040]  cyber hack or anything but the feds came in and tried to make an issue out of it and she got a lot
[19:30.040 --> 19:37.800]  of pushback because she was trying to prosecute him her husband tweeted and said don't push back on
[19:37.800 --> 19:43.560]  carmen she offered him a three-month plea bargain and he turned it down that tweet was subsequently
[19:43.560 --> 19:50.840]  deleted i don't think he committed suicide and now we have sissa because one person can make a
[19:50.840 --> 19:55.640]  difference that's why they take them out stay with us we're going to tell you what julian assange says
[19:55.640 --> 20:01.960]  to do next and that is you snail melby we'll be right back my name is bill bonner and i'm the president
[20:01.960 --> 20:08.120]  of the largest private news and research network in the world and i paid for this airtime because i
[20:08.120 --> 20:14.280]  have an important message to the american people there's a change coming that the government isn't
[20:14.280 --> 20:21.640]  telling you about this change has deep implications for life in america from where you shop to the
[20:21.640 --> 20:27.960]  doctors you visit and the family you want to protect look i've made predictions like this before
[20:27.960 --> 20:35.560]  thing is i was right then too a few years ago i warned that housing prices would collapse they
[20:35.560 --> 20:44.520]  did before that i warned that dot com companies would crash they did those who listened had a
[20:44.520 --> 20:50.360]  chance to save themselves but this has nothing to do with the stock market this will affect us all
[20:50.360 --> 20:56.760]  you can watch the video for free right now by going to dollar danger dot com again that's dollar

[21:03.640 --> 21:07.720]  compounds that in many areas of the world are actually sold by prescription but when we look at
[21:07.720 --> 21:13.000]  a product like survival shield nason iodine x2 it's something that really has been hiding in plain
[21:13.000 --> 21:18.600]  view for over a hundred years the federal government mandated from the 20s until the 70s that iodine
[21:18.600 --> 21:23.400]  accrued form of it be added to table salt because of the incredible health problems that dietary
[21:23.400 --> 21:28.120]  deficiency and iodine was causing i want to challenge the listeners who've not tried x2 for
[21:28.120 --> 21:31.880]  yourselves what do you have to lose you are the tip of the spear in the fight for human

[21:36.920 --> 21:41.560]  people's lives that i know and the final reason to try x2 is that it's so hard to keep in stock
[21:41.560 --> 21:46.520]  we ordered the biggest shipment ever six months ago and that is about to sell out it may be a month
[21:46.520 --> 21:51.400]  or two until more comes in i want to challenge all of you in the next week to stock up on survival

[25:12.520 --> 25:19.160]  for free shipping let's go back to what's happening with our never-ending always metastasizing
[25:19.160 --> 25:25.800]  cancer of a surveillance state here here's a lawsuit that's just been dismissed it's from
[25:25.800 --> 25:32.120]  this wicca media wicca wicca media versus the nsa it's a lawsuit that's been dismissed by the judge
[25:32.760 --> 25:38.040]  and listen to the reason that it was dismissed because they couldn't prove that they were being
[25:38.040 --> 25:45.960]  surveilled secretly i mean seriously this is straight out of a kafka novel he says well you
[25:45.960 --> 25:51.320]  know you have no way of knowing if we're secretly spying on you so uh i'm not gonna let i'm not
[25:51.320 --> 25:56.840]  going to maintain this lawsuit i mean seriously what the judge is saying they say plaintiffs can
[25:56.840 --> 26:03.080]  only speculate that they are being uh spied upon by the nsa so i'm not going to allow you to do any
[26:03.080 --> 26:08.840]  discovery or do a lawsuit and he says and for one thing here's another thing he says plaintiffs
[26:08.840 --> 26:15.480]  insist that wicca pedias over one trillion annual internet communications are significant in volume
[26:15.480 --> 26:21.560]  and then the judge goes on to say but one trillion is clearly a large number but size is always
[26:21.560 --> 26:27.480]  relative for example one trillion dollars are enormous value well maybe not to the federal
[26:27.480 --> 26:34.200]  government but he says whereas one trillion grains of sand are but a small patch of a beach like what
[26:34.200 --> 26:40.600]  what is he talking about here you got a judge arguing about how many angels fit on the head
[26:40.600 --> 26:46.440]  of a pen and using that as justification it is nothing but sophistry and obfuscation we all
[26:46.440 --> 26:52.440]  know what they're doing we all know that they are watching people but he says because you can't prove
[26:52.440 --> 26:56.440]  that you're being watched i mean there's you know documents that have been released and you know
[26:56.440 --> 27:00.920]  we've had leaks of documents we've had nsa whistleblowers testifying that you're doing this but you
[27:00.920 --> 27:06.840]  know that you can't prove it and so you have to prove it before you get your day in court that's
[27:06.840 --> 27:12.920]  essentially the kind of kafka world that we live in absolutely amazing so julien assange
[27:13.560 --> 27:18.040]  is now telling journalists he says you need to go back to the old methods you need to use snail
[27:18.040 --> 27:23.880]  mail traditional post office services well you know that that is true i mean it is not as vulnerable
[27:23.880 --> 27:30.280]  as email but of course one of the reasons that the government has always run the post office system
[27:30.280 --> 27:35.720]  in the first place is because they wanted to use that as a crude level of intelligence gathering
[27:35.720 --> 27:40.040]  they can put a postal cover on you and they can keep a a record of everybody that you send mail
[27:40.040 --> 27:43.400]  to and everybody that sends mail to you they don't have to get a search warrant for that that's where
[27:43.400 --> 27:48.760]  this all started started with that started with these pen registers for the phone companies
[27:48.760 --> 27:56.040]  and now this is just metastasizing and a full-blown or well in police state astazi state but he
[27:56.040 --> 28:00.920]  points out he says my recommendation for people who don't have 10 years experience in cryptography
[28:00.920 --> 28:07.320]  is to return to old methods and use traditional postal services julien assange said in an interview
[28:07.320 --> 28:12.600]  that was published on saturday and you need to understand that they're always watching you and
[28:12.600 --> 28:17.320]  he has warned people about that he's warned people about what they put on facebook he says you know
[28:17.320 --> 28:23.160]  facebook is basically uh your friends uh testifying against you has had a view on the dock i don't
[28:23.160 --> 28:27.080]  remember the exact quote that he had but he was warning everybody about social media especially
[28:27.640 --> 28:33.880]  look at this incredibly ridiculous decision from a local judge a judge says that a small
[28:33.880 --> 28:40.040]  school's facebook post was actually a campaign contribution this is a state judge he ruled
[28:40.040 --> 28:45.880]  that a facebook post by a school called liberty commons amounted to an illegal campaign contribution
[28:45.880 --> 28:51.320]  to a school district board candidate the charter school shared on its facebook fault with its
[28:51.320 --> 28:56.120]  facebook followers a newspaper article about the parent of one of the students who's running for a
[28:56.120 --> 29:02.760]  school board seat and the neighboring school district now this school has 566 followers on
[29:02.760 --> 29:10.280]  its facebook page it was then shared by a former congressman who lost his reelection bid in 2004
[29:10.280 --> 29:15.640]  and he has 3900 friends the administrative law judge called the violation minor and he ruled
[29:15.640 --> 29:18.920]  that no government money or any significant amount was spent to make the contribution
[29:19.480 --> 29:25.560]  but he also said that it was giving of a thing of value to a candidate namely favorable publicity
[29:25.560 --> 29:31.160]  do you understand the dangerous precedents on free speech that that represents the university
[29:31.160 --> 29:36.440]  of colorado law professor scott moss did he says i don't buy under the first amendment speech
[29:36.440 --> 29:43.560]  can uh can be deemed as a contribution he says this judge has a grandpa simpson understanding
[29:43.560 --> 29:51.080]  of the law and of email we'll be right back stay with us we're on the march the empires on the run
[29:51.960 --> 29:54.840]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[29:58.760 --> 30:05.080]  kid daniels info wars dot com gun deaths are down 30 percent since 1993 that's right all gun deaths
[30:05.080 --> 30:09.880]  including murders suicides police shootings and accidental shootings have dropped nearly a third
[30:09.880 --> 30:15.560]  in between 1993 and 2000 the firearm murder rate dropped by almost half but guess what california
[30:15.560 --> 30:20.120]  which has some of the strictest gun laws in the country leads the nation and murders according to
[30:20.120 --> 30:24.520]  the washington examiner and generally speaking the most violent cities in the country have the most
[30:24.520 --> 30:28.680]  severe gun restrictions that isn't that surprising i mean if you're out committing violent crimes you
[30:28.680 --> 30:32.760]  really want your victims shooting back so isn't it ironic then that the mainstream media and the
[30:32.760 --> 30:36.440]  obama administration are currently pushing for more gun control president obama is even
[30:36.440 --> 30:40.920]  considering enacting gun control via executive order but not only is that illegal it's also
[30:40.920 --> 30:45.960]  dictatorial former house majority leader tom delay called that an impeachable offense in an interview
[30:45.960 --> 30:49.880]  with newsmax he said it's time for the house to start letting the people know that this is a lawless
[30:49.880 --> 30:54.120]  president and that's true an imperial president isn't just a threat to our second amendment rights
[30:54.120 --> 30:59.960]  but all of our freedoms once again this is kid danielswithinfowars.com when cells become toxic

[33:15.080 --> 33:23.240]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night your host today we're going to talk about
[33:24.120 --> 33:30.040]  the failures the design failures of obama care and some amazing new information about people
[33:30.760 --> 33:36.440]  getting fined who have small companies that are just trying to help their employees with some
[33:37.320 --> 33:42.600]  with some health care expenses and the fines that they're going to be facing they're far worse
[33:42.600 --> 33:49.080]  than not participating in obama care in the first place it's absolutely amazing how they are focusing
[33:49.080 --> 33:53.240]  on people but before we do i want to continue on with this facebook i was just talking about this
[33:53.800 --> 34:00.440]  judge who said that posting information about somebody's candidacy on facebook was a campaign
[34:00.440 --> 34:07.800]  contribution i want you to think about that think about how dangerous that is think about how that
[34:07.800 --> 34:14.200]  is going to silence our freedom of speech and quite frankly that's one of the the problems
[34:14.200 --> 34:18.680]  that i have with campaign finance control i understand that we have corporations
[34:18.680 --> 34:22.520]  that are buying the election of course they're buying the trade treaties are buying everything
[34:22.520 --> 34:30.040]  the corporations run the government nevertheless when they enact campaign prohibitions that's
[34:30.040 --> 34:35.400]  going to fall on the smaller people you understand of course don't you that the that the government
[34:35.400 --> 34:41.560]  the government multinational corporations will make sure that they have loopholes written for them
[34:41.560 --> 34:46.360]  they will know how they can get around these loopholes this is going to be a spider's web that
[34:46.360 --> 34:51.000]  is going to catch the small flies and that's but the great big bumblebees are going to go right
[34:51.000 --> 34:56.680]  through it and that's what we have to be worried about if you've got idiotic judges like this local
[34:56.680 --> 35:02.040]  judge saying that a facebook post is a campaign contribution but of course it can also be some
[35:02.040 --> 35:07.480]  things very dangerous look at this story out of egypt and of course this is our close ally in egypt
[35:08.520 --> 35:14.680]  we just have a news of a guy who is going to get three years in jail for simply putting mickey
[35:14.680 --> 35:21.640]  mouse ears behind photoshopping them putting mickey mouse ears behind a picture of the president
[35:21.640 --> 35:30.760]  abdel fatal el sissy you know i guess having a name like el sissy makes you extremely sensitive to
[35:30.760 --> 35:35.960]  any mocking and take a look at that picture if you're watching this broadcast there he is
[35:35.960 --> 35:43.400]  and as i say that picture should go viral that picture should be shared by everyone all over
[35:43.400 --> 35:51.080]  social media he was charged with quote attempting to overthrow the regime for putting mickey mouse
[35:51.080 --> 35:58.760]  ears on him and getting three years in jail and you just have to understand that as ridiculous as
[35:58.760 --> 36:05.160]  this may seem to us now understand that all of the political correctness shaming that's going on
[36:05.160 --> 36:11.320]  on social media as they're moving towards this understand that they are preparing us in the west
[36:12.120 --> 36:18.440]  for this kind of censorship that's what's fundamentally behind all of this these shaming
[36:18.440 --> 36:25.720]  campaigns all of this political correctness again we were talking about the irs investing in sting
[36:25.720 --> 36:32.600]  ray devices to watch people of course now the fbi director has come out and said that cell phone
[36:32.600 --> 36:38.040]  cameras are to blame for the rise in hostile relationships between the police and the public
[36:38.040 --> 36:45.080]  there you go shoot the messenger in this case the iphone's okay it's not that they're spying on us
[36:45.080 --> 36:48.680]  it's not that they're beating us no no you know actually actually he ought to take this and turn
[36:48.680 --> 36:55.240]  it around the other way as well perhaps their constant surveillance is creating a kind of minority
[36:55.240 --> 37:01.400]  report pre-crime environment where they single people out and we're going to talk about that in
[37:01.400 --> 37:07.000]  just a moment but of course the fbi director's name is james comey and he is now saying cell
[37:07.000 --> 37:11.960]  phone cameras are poisoning the relationship there they're not going to do anything to change
[37:12.520 --> 37:18.200]  the shoot first brutal instructions that are coming out of washington that are taking over
[37:18.200 --> 37:23.800]  our local law enforcement making them not accountable to local citizens no they're not
[37:23.800 --> 37:29.320]  going to change any of that instead they're going to complain about cell phones and that
[37:29.320 --> 37:33.720]  is going to have the logical result of the if he can keep this narrative going of course they will
[37:33.720 --> 37:38.520]  ban cell phones or put some kind of a restriction on cell phones that when the police are doing
[37:38.520 --> 37:43.080]  their work they can flip a switch and you won't be able to record or transmit what's going on
[37:43.720 --> 37:47.240]  that's where this is really headed but it was interesting when they put this up on the daily
[37:47.240 --> 37:55.080]  mail about three bullet points down they say of course his name is james comey they say comedy
[37:55.080 --> 38:01.720]  blames the youtube effect they put his name in as comedy and maybe that's what we ought to do
[38:01.720 --> 38:07.960]  maybe we ought to ridicule him and laugh at him like this egyptian dictator with the mickey
[38:07.960 --> 38:13.320]  mouse ears maybe we ought to start calling this fbi director james comedy if he's going to tell us
[38:13.320 --> 38:17.960]  that cell phone cameras are the problems with the way the police are interacting with people
[38:18.840 --> 38:24.920]  he truly is a james comedy here's where this is all headed and just like i said you know maybe
[38:24.920 --> 38:31.720]  that i think about the fact that their constant surveillance is causing them to overreact maybe
[38:31.720 --> 38:37.320]  that's the problem here's an example of this we got a minority report pre-crime in new hampshire a
[38:37.320 --> 38:44.520]  teen arrested after he just parked in a predictive hotspot for crime this is an 18 year old man he
[38:44.520 --> 38:50.360]  was arrested in manchester new hampshire a police officer scoped him out for parking within a quote
[38:50.360 --> 38:55.240]  predictive hotspot for crime in other words they say well this area is going to be a high crime area
[38:55.800 --> 38:59.640]  and they made sure it was a high crime area except in this case it was the police committing the
[38:59.640 --> 39:07.000]  crimes on october 20th connor delir was sitting by himself in his part 2000 honda accord and he
[39:07.000 --> 39:11.240]  was in an area as i said a hotspot deemed by computer programs you see this is going to be
[39:11.240 --> 39:15.000]  this is where we're going to be heading you're going to have computer programs and algorithms
[39:15.000 --> 39:19.800]  that are going to flag you we've already seen this with spy cameras that are hooked up to
[39:19.800 --> 39:25.720]  predictive software flagging someone who was changing a flat tire they thought he was involved
[39:25.720 --> 39:30.360]  in car theft because he stood by the car then he disappeared they couldn't see him in the camera so
[39:30.360 --> 39:36.200]  what they do well they call the swat team out against this guy who had a flat tire now in
[39:36.200 --> 39:40.040]  that particular case it turned out okay in this particular in this in this case i'm telling you
[39:40.040 --> 39:47.320]  about here though it did not turn out okay he was parked at 535 the cop thought that looks suspicious
[39:47.320 --> 39:55.160]  fine so he circles around he blocks the path of the car with his squad car and then gets out
[39:55.160 --> 39:58.440]  and starts to question the individual at which point this individual gets nervous
[39:59.240 --> 40:03.640]  and the officer says he attempted to provide a legitimate reason for being in the area
[40:03.640 --> 40:08.760]  why should he have to provide a legitimate reason for being in the area the cop could
[40:08.760 --> 40:13.240]  sit there and watch him if he wanted to to see if he's going to commit a crime perhaps his presence
[40:13.240 --> 40:19.160]  might deter a crime if this guy was going to commit a crime but he doesn't need to have a legitimate
[40:19.160 --> 40:25.560]  area he doesn't need to justify being in an area to the police nevertheless the cop ordered him out
[40:25.560 --> 40:30.200]  of the car shortly after that a second officer arrived then they noticed that he had a holstered
[40:30.200 --> 40:35.560]  Beretta 9 millimeter handgun they removed it put it inside of his vehicle but they confirmed that
[40:35.560 --> 40:43.000]  his gun was properly permitted and registered now they want to inspect his car they say he grew
[40:43.000 --> 40:48.440]  agitated he stated he was not allowing a search of his person or his property in other words
[40:48.440 --> 40:52.920]  he's going to stand on his constitutional rights you want to search my car go to a judge get a warrant
[40:52.920 --> 40:57.400]  well they didn't want to do that so they advised him that they were conducting a pat down search
[40:57.400 --> 41:04.200]  to ensure their safety so now they're afraid after they engage this guy for just sitting in
[41:04.200 --> 41:08.200]  his car after they get him out of his car now they're concerned because there's two of them
[41:08.200 --> 41:12.760]  and one of them they're concerned for their safety so then they find an object in his in his pocket
[41:12.760 --> 41:17.960]  and of course it is a loaded magazine that is just sitting there waiting to go off in his pocket
[41:18.760 --> 41:24.840]  they take that out put it on the top of the car and continue the search and then they say
[41:24.840 --> 41:29.880]  he was transitioned to the ground before being pepper sprayed and tasered by newly arriving
[41:29.880 --> 41:35.560]  backup officers now the interesting thing about this is that somebody on a reddit discussion
[41:35.560 --> 41:40.920]  put this up and said wow i can comment on this this literally happened outside my window i went
[41:40.920 --> 41:45.320]  to the window for a smoke as two officers had him bit over the car trying to put handcuffs on him
[41:45.320 --> 41:50.680]  he was asking them over and over again what have i done wrong they got tired of him not letting them
[41:50.680 --> 41:55.480]  put handcuffs on they put him on the sidewalk face down trying to strong arm the cuffs on finally
[41:55.480 --> 41:59.400]  they call for backup he's just trying to keep one arm away from him and asking what did i do wrong
[41:59.400 --> 42:04.760]  just tell me what did i do wrong suddenly he says my street was swarmed with cops one guy ran up
[42:04.760 --> 42:09.000]  with like a taser in his hand zapped him while he's on the ground he had like five guys holding
[42:09.000 --> 42:13.480]  him down they got the cuffs on him they threw him in a patty wagon when i saw him get up he had a
[42:13.480 --> 42:19.080]  huge cut on his forehead i assume because one of the cops was grinding his face into the ground
[42:19.080 --> 42:23.880]  with his knee i didn't know they pepper sprayed him i didn't see that he says but he said they
[42:23.880 --> 42:28.440]  didn't tow his car they just left it in the area he said i had no idea they arrested him for just
[42:28.440 --> 42:36.280]  being around here wtf he says yeah why would that happen well here's another one for you okay you
[42:36.280 --> 42:41.560]  think well gee i guess he had it coming because he's parked in an area that the uh they have
[42:41.560 --> 42:48.280]  identified as a hotspot well here's some people attending a bright bart news sponsored event and
[42:48.280 --> 42:55.080]  scott stale arizona and they get the police helicopters with spotlights a massive police
[42:55.080 --> 43:01.240]  presence turnout because they are having an event in a local sports bar they go to the sports bar
[43:01.240 --> 43:07.000]  they have a speech that's going on by one of the bright bart people talking about conservative
[43:07.000 --> 43:11.960]  issues the u.s constitution the second amendment securing the poor issues border they say suddenly
[43:12.520 --> 43:17.160]  one or two people complained to the establishment's management and shortly after that they cut the
[43:17.160 --> 43:23.960]  microphones and the volume of the televisions was turned up and then multiple police showed up
[43:23.960 --> 43:28.120]  i said there's no confrontations no shouting so yelling no fighting no disagreement no disturbing
[43:28.120 --> 43:34.280]  the peace absolutely nothing he says the police were completely professional courteous but seemed
[43:34.280 --> 43:39.480]  somewhat surprised that they were there but said it was reported by the group that we had been unruly
[43:40.040 --> 43:44.200]  he says as an attendee of the event i and everyone else in attendance can tell you that we were not
[43:44.200 --> 43:49.160]  unruly they believe that it was the subject of what was being talked about and this is what you
[43:49.160 --> 43:58.440]  need to be concerned about the fact that we live in a stasi snitch state somebody see something
[43:58.440 --> 44:03.320]  they say something if they're offended by something they report you to the police and fortunately
[44:04.040 --> 44:09.160]  nothing happened nobody got injured in this particular case but that is the way this is
[44:09.160 --> 44:15.480]  going down multiple times i want to talk to you about obama care and as i pointed out this amazing
[44:15.480 --> 44:19.640]  new regulation and also the fraud that has been discovered in it very quickly though i want to

[44:54.360 --> 45:00.520]  one we talked about the guys being poets down in uh nicaragua uh bernie sandernista and i call him
[45:00.520 --> 45:06.040]  that because he was talking 30 years ago just like uh you know back to the future and like doc
[45:06.040 --> 45:12.440]  from back to the future except back 30 years ago he was praising the sandernistas he was praising
[45:12.440 --> 45:17.080]  them he said yeah these guys aren't political hacks no no they're like hippies they're poets they got
[45:17.080 --> 45:21.080]  vermont connections you know they're kind of just like me you guys got that clip ready let's roll that
[45:21.080 --> 45:28.360]  clip i was impressed by father discoto and and he is a very gentle very loving man he's familiar
[45:28.360 --> 45:32.200]  with burlington vermont he had a niece who graduated yeah he's like me from say michael's
[45:32.200 --> 45:36.520]  college actually he was now working for the government for the nicaragua uh watega is an
[45:36.520 --> 45:42.280]  impressive guy uh it's an impressive guy hernesto cardinel is a funny looking guy he's gray hair
[45:42.280 --> 45:46.040]  and he really does remind you of the hippie i mean hernesto and in fact it's kind of like me uh
[45:47.720 --> 45:54.680]  you know we talk he's very strongly into poetry uh he is very proud of the fact that they are now
[45:54.680 --> 46:00.040]  teaching poetry not only the peasants and the workers but in the in the military uh in the
[46:00.040 --> 46:05.400]  police department a very impressive guy yeah the peasants the military you know they got their own
[46:05.400 --> 46:09.960]  little malice cultural revolution going on down there it's great and these guys look like me you
[46:09.960 --> 46:15.560]  know the hippies they got you know long white hair connections to vermont they're not political hacks
[46:16.120 --> 46:22.120]  say he's caught up in identity politics he's caught up in the left right paradigm he loved the
[46:22.120 --> 46:29.720]  sandernistas bernie uh sandernista did he loved them because he opposed the american government
[46:29.720 --> 46:34.840]  policy of overthrowing whatever countries they want overthrow and i agree with him i agree that
[46:34.840 --> 46:42.280]  iran contra was a horrible thing i agree that the uh smuggling of crack cocaine by the cia to fund
[46:42.280 --> 46:46.520]  the contras into la was a horrible thing i don't think we should be overthrowing other countries
[46:46.520 --> 46:53.080]  but that doesn't mean that the sandernistas were good guys bernie see that's what happens
[46:53.080 --> 46:58.360]  when you get caught up in the left right paradigm when you get into this either or mentality and
[46:58.360 --> 47:02.120]  he hasn't learned anything in the last 30 years as i pointed out when i talked about this before
[47:02.840 --> 47:09.960]  he hasn't learned about what happened with daniel ortega daniel ortega who was so thoroughly
[47:09.960 --> 47:17.080]  corrupt he was thrown out by coalition of conservatives and communists he was a kleptocrat
[47:17.080 --> 47:21.240]  he was somebody who had confiscated billions of dollars of private property and just before he
[47:21.240 --> 47:28.040]  left he made it private again he made it his property that's the kind of guy that daniel ortega
[47:28.040 --> 47:33.160]  is but of course bernie sanders was taken in by it because he bought into well if reagan is against
[47:33.160 --> 47:39.160]  him i'm for him and besides that you know he looks like me you know and he's got uh even here the
[47:39.160 --> 47:44.920]  the rhetoric you know the peasants and the poets i mean the peasants and the the uh uh the serfs
[47:44.920 --> 47:52.120]  or whatever i mean he's got this class warfare marxist rhetoric that comes from bernie sanders
[47:52.120 --> 47:56.040]  but it's okay because he's got the police and the military learning poetry too isn't that great
[47:56.040 --> 47:59.320]  isn't that great they're all a bunch of poets so i had a lot of people when i talked about this
[47:59.320 --> 48:03.720]  before they said you know why are you picking on bernie sanders why are you picking on the
[48:03.720 --> 48:08.280]  failed social states and central america you know like nicaragua and venezuela where the bankers get
[48:08.280 --> 48:15.640]  700 on their their investments in venezuela communist venezuela yugo chavez gives the bankers 700
[48:15.640 --> 48:21.000]  percent on their investments but the people there can't get food medicine or water they have to go
[48:21.000 --> 48:24.760]  elsewhere to get that so they said why are you picking on that you know why don't you you always
[48:24.760 --> 48:33.800]  ignore the successes of socialism you know like sweden okay well let's talk about sweden sweden
[48:33.800 --> 48:39.160]  needs to borrow more they need to cut their costs in order to meet refugee numbers says their finance
[48:39.160 --> 48:46.600]  minister open borders entitlements the socialist state either one of those things will destroy a
[48:46.600 --> 48:52.600]  country but you put them both together and you start sailing over the cliff uh like philma and
[48:52.600 --> 48:57.880]  louise okay and that's what's happening that was what cloward and piven strategized about back in
[48:57.880 --> 49:02.440]  the 1960s they said you know we just aren't getting there quickly enough so what we're gonna have to
[49:02.440 --> 49:07.000]  do is we're gonna have to destroy the society so we can rebuild our socialist utopia how do we do
[49:07.000 --> 49:13.160]  that well we ramp up the entitlement state and then we ramp up the number of people that are going
[49:13.160 --> 49:16.760]  to be on the entitlement state so now we can see what's happening in sweden you don't see this kind
[49:16.760 --> 49:22.440]  of thing happening in central and south america simply because sweden and the european states of
[49:22.440 --> 49:28.760]  germany and others were so rich to start with it didn't take very long for socialism to collapse
[49:28.760 --> 49:33.480]  in central and south america even after they confiscate billions of dollars of wealth from
[49:33.480 --> 49:38.520]  other people it's still they still couldn't make it go that long as margaret thatcher said the
[49:38.520 --> 49:42.120]  problem with socialism is you eventually run out of other people's money well they didn't have that
[49:42.120 --> 49:45.960]  much of it to start with in central america so you saw the results right away but now we're starting
[49:45.960 --> 49:50.600]  to see the results in sweden so we had this story back on the 23rd sweden will need to borrow more
[49:50.600 --> 49:55.320]  money cut costs across the board to meet the expense of record numbers of asylum asylum seekers
[49:55.320 --> 50:00.040]  arriving in the country said the finance minister then we had another one uh that was a couple of
[50:00.040 --> 50:04.760]  days earlier kurt nemo pointed out that sweden was on the verge of collapse as illegal immigrants
[50:04.760 --> 50:10.760]  surge into the country the anti-immigration party is now the largest in the scandinavian nation
[50:10.760 --> 50:16.680]  he points out and this is a quote from a danish historian says the final consequence of the west
[50:16.680 --> 50:22.680]  and above all sweden's immigration policy is that the economy will collapse because who is going to
[50:22.680 --> 50:28.920]  pay for it all and economic breakdowns once they happen always happen very quickly increasing
[50:28.920 --> 50:33.640]  taxes he said on wage earners in sweden to pay for the influx of illegal immigrants is not enough
[50:33.640 --> 50:38.280]  the finance minister said of course they're going to borrow this they said why has one government
[50:38.280 --> 50:43.000]  after another chosen to spend swedish taxpayers money to support and shelter citizens of other
[50:43.000 --> 50:49.400]  countries while some of them are trying to kill us precisely when we come back we're going to
[50:49.400 --> 50:57.240]  break down how that looks in america with obama care we'll be right back
[51:01.480 --> 51:07.400]  earthquake floods winter storms prolonged power outages or war each of us have had that moment
[51:07.400 --> 51:11.960]  when we recognize that we need to be better prepared we typically do the same thing we
[51:11.960 --> 51:17.000]  start with food storage then we address the need for water but have you considered heat storage
[51:17.000 --> 51:21.480]  i'm talking about staying warm in the cold here are some things for you to consider
[51:21.480 --> 51:25.960]  how will i keep my family warm the standard answers are firewood coal or propane but the
[51:25.960 --> 51:31.640]  problem with that if you need to be on the move is you can't take it with you another concern
[51:31.640 --> 51:36.040]  there may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke like in times of war there may
[51:36.040 --> 51:41.240]  even come a time when you can't burn fuel the answers may be simpler and less costly than you
[51:41.240 --> 51:47.080]  think for these answers go to fortress clothing dot com again fortress clothing dot com has the
[51:47.080 --> 51:53.240]  answers to your heat storage dilemma don't get stuck in the cold fortress clothing dot com
[51:53.240 --> 52:02.840]  you'll never be cold again as any regular listener knows i don't script what i have to say i do my

[55:23.720 --> 55:29.080]  in order to house third world immigrants now when they do that to us do you think that'll
[55:29.080 --> 55:34.280]  be a violation of the third amendment i mean it's not they're not troops but i guess you
[55:34.280 --> 55:38.600]  could call them troops because they're kind of marching in like an army look at this picture
[55:38.600 --> 55:45.160]  that they we've got from the daily mail uh of a march into western europe shocking pictures show

[56:20.920 --> 56:27.160]  and of course we see that in sweden one of the other aspects of this is a aspect of cultural shock

[56:32.440 --> 56:37.640]  where there are significant muslim immigration is the crime rate especially the disproportional

[01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:30.120]  night your host i said we would go to obama care i'm actually going to hold that and do that in
[01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:35.000]  the next segment because we have a lot of stations that during this segment are airing news so let
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:40.920]  me give you some news about what it looks like when the economy collapses we just had a guy in
[01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:47.560]  london talking about how you had had to pay 500 pounds for a cupboard under the stairs to live in
[01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:54.600]  that's not that's not a place to live in folks um and again that's about 750 us dollars take a
[01:00:54.600 --> 01:01:00.840]  look at what's going on in port urico they're looking at organ transplants to cure their ailing
[01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:06.280]  economy this is coming out of reuters they say port urico is trying to build its medical tourism
[01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:12.680]  industry from a current level of about 80 million dollars a year to 300 million dollars by 2017
[01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:19.720]  as part of efforts to heal its chronically sick economy now listen to just how sick this is
[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:27.640]  port urico's potential they say as a transplant center is partly based on a macabre statistic
[01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:34.920]  the caribbean island has a murder and non-negligent manslaughter rate of 19.2 per hundred thousand
[01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:45.720]  in 2014 versus 4.5 per hundred thousand in the us so 19.2 versus 4.5 in other words over four times
[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:52.200]  the number of murders per capita that they have in the us but hey they look at that and they say
[01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:58.200]  that's not a bug that's a feature we can create a soylent green economy out of that bring in the
[01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:07.160]  scoops okay they say the this translates into a pool of donors in the 18 to 30 age range the donors
[01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:12.200]  are victims of car accidents or gunshot wounds to the head yes because port urico they say sadly we
[01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:18.520]  have a very high crime rate so there you go it's not a bug it's a feature and we can build an economy
[01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:27.960]  off of our murder rate how sick is that that's kind of like you know bernie sanders come out and
[01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:34.760]  saying we need to mandate maternity leave because we have this enlightened place like communist china
[01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:39.320]  you know where they literally shoot people in the head if you're part of fallen gong or your
[01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:44.200]  christians or whatever i mean they they're known for for doing that and of course they have their
[01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:48.600]  forced abortions if you have more than one child they have a one child policy have had for a long
[01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:54.920]  time that has loosened up in some of the provinces now but some of them are still extremely rigorous
[01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:59.720]  and enforcing a one child policy so bernie sanders looks at this and goes hey you know we could have
[01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:05.800]  you know china not exactly a model when it comes to human rights provides 14 weeks of paid maternity
[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:11.560]  leave and as this article from kit daniels last week pointed out he was immediately called on that
[01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:20.040]  by james wood saying you are a moron another moron they kill babies they're forced abortions
[01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:25.960]  and other things so i mean that's when you don't understand the difference between positive and
[01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:31.720]  negative rights as they've talked about of course people like obama constitutional professor certainly
[01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:35.480]  did understand the difference between positive negative rights he talked about it before he
[01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:41.160]  became president he said you know our constitution has a system of what we would call negative rights
[01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:47.320]  saying that government your your rights are based on prohibitions of what government can do to you
[01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:51.160]  those are negative rights and he's not the only person to to use that connotation i think it's
[01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:55.400]  perfectly valid to to call them positive and negative because you're prohibiting the government
[01:03:55.400 --> 01:04:00.600]  from doing certain things that was what the constitution was set up to do which is a setup
[01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:06.760]  to say that you know we have we possess these rights as created human beings we all have the
[01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:11.400]  same rights because we're all created by the same god and so we need to be respected because
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:16.120]  we're human and these things we possess because we're humans so we create a government to protect
[01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:20.600]  those rights that was the essence of the declaration of independence instead the socialist comes in and
[01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:27.800]  says no you have a right to food you have a right to shelter you have a right to education you have
[01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:32.760]  a right to maternity leave those are what they call positive rights i have a right to take this the
[01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:38.440]  problem is that in order for government to provide that to you they have to take something from
[01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:44.280]  somebody else very different than protect than preventing the government from taking what you
[01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:49.960]  possess as a human being stay with us when we come back i promise i will talk about this new
[01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:54.360]  revelation of obama care an amazing new penalty we'll be right back
[01:04:54.360 --> 01:05:03.400]  after the release of numerous videos showing questionable Planned Parenthood practices
[01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:08.760]  multiple facilities have been raided raiders reports texas officials rated several Planned
[01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:13.960]  Parenthood facilities on thursday and a move that comes days after the state republican leaders
[01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:18.760]  bar the women's health group from receiving state medicaid money the inspector general's office
[01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:23.960]  declined to comment but its agents were seen on local news reports entering a Planned Parenthood
[01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:29.000]  facility in san antonio texas said it would launch a probe of Planned Parenthood after
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:34.440]  the release of videos in july by an anti-abortion activist group center for medical progress in
[01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:39.960]  which a Planned Parenthood official is seen talking about transactions involving fetal tissue
[01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:44.840]  and speaking on a personal note Planned Parenthood continues to say that the videos were edited
[01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:50.040]  which they were much like you would edit a state of a union address down to a few sound bites but
[01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:56.600]  that doesn't mean that they were taken out of context you can find more reports on info wars.com

[01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:13.880]  back to being a staffer somebody like paul ryan paul ryan o is what we ought to call him and it
[01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:21.560]  looks like he is now going to become the next uh gop power broker uh he has tapped uh david hop
[01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:28.040]  somebody who also worked with him uh with jack kimp many years they go way back he's a former
[01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:34.200]  advisor to republican congressional leaders they say and spoken of by the washington post as a
[01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:40.520]  gop power broker himself of course he's being supported by this now by the conservatives people
[01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:46.360]  like the heritage foundation people like jim dement who were supposed to be opposed to open
[01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:54.680]  borders they are backing paul ryan o 100 now it appears so there's a few holdouts people like
[01:09:54.680 --> 01:10:01.160]  louis gomert louis gomert said uh he is supporting daniel webster he says daniel webster and then
[01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:06.120]  this is a representative from florida he was speaker of the house uh when he was in florida
[01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:10.280]  he said dan is the only person i'm aware of who's been a speaker anywhere he decentralized
[01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:15.000]  power to get it back in the hands of the members he says john bainer is no longer going to be
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:20.440]  speaker because he was too powerful i simply cannot vote for a candidate who demands more power
[01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:25.480]  before he agrees to become the speaker that's what paul ryan is doing that's why drudge has had
[01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:32.600]  links up talking about how paul ryan is demanding that he be crowned as king he's not going to make
[01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:38.440]  any promises to anybody he doesn't want any demands he even wants to have the ability to remove the
[01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:44.040]  speaker the motion to vacate the chair he wants that taken away so that you can't take him out
[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:49.480]  and that's a guy that the conservatives want to support i still don't understand what happened
[01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:55.320]  to the original motion to vacate the chair when they had an election coming up they had john bainer's
[01:10:55.320 --> 01:11:00.840]  number two guy his chosen successor that he wanted to see kevin mccarthy they had two other people
[01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:07.560]  they had daniel webster they had uh uh jason chaffetz we're both going to run and then kevin
[01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:10.920]  mccarthy stood up at the beginning of the meeting and said no i'm not going to run i'm withdrawing
[01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:15.320]  my name at that point john bainer shut down the election because his candidate wasn't running what
[01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:21.320]  is going on in washington and of course this is the third highest position in the federal
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:26.120]  government you got the president the vice president next in line uh if those two were to die would be
[01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:30.200]  the speaker of the house the speaker of the house wields a great deal of power but we've
[01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:36.600]  seen john bainer wielding it in the same way as nancy policy for the same issues for open border
[01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:43.080]  for trade promotion fast tracking the trade promotion doing this secret corporate agreement
[01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:48.200]  they're all operating the same way there's total agreement at the top that's why the white house
[01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:53.880]  is very excited about paul ryan just like the so-called conservative organizations like heritage
[01:11:53.880 --> 01:12:01.400]  foundation with jim de mit betraying the gop voters 93 percent of them do not want open borders
[01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:09.320]  so why does why is jeb bush so surprised that he's sinking into irrelevancy you know jeb bush
[01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:13.480]  came out and he said uh well you know he had to meet this weekend with his mom and dad that's what
[01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:18.520]  uh uh trump told him he said here's a guy who wants to run our country he can't even run his own
[01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:23.000]  campaign you know what he's cutting back big time he has no money he's cutting he's meeting today
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:27.960]  with his mommy and daddy and they're working on his campaign trying to twist all of their old
[01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:33.080]  political connections to try to get people to continue to pour money into the bush campaign
[01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:36.200]  even though the voters don't want to have anything to do with them why don't they want to have
[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:40.760]  anything to do with him why is trump high in the polls you can see this article that we got up on
[01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:47.000]  info wars dot com today a pro immigration protester dragged out of a trump event by an attendee the
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:55.240]  supporters are chanting usa usa that's the answer you want to know why you're failing jeb bush
[01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:59.640]  you know people called him on it and he said uh blah blah blah that's my answer to you blah blah
[01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:06.760]  blah try to pick that up out of the article is a great headline yeah that's his response to people
[01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:12.920]  and he says you know um i could be doing some really cool things i don't need to be sitting
[01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:19.080]  around here miserable listening to people demonize me feeling compelled to demonize them well please
[01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:24.440]  do please do go do something that's really cool because you're not really a very cool candidate
[01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:29.560]  you have absolutely no respect for the wishes of the american people you have trumped your open
[01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:33.160]  border issues and i guess he feels like he can get away with it because we've now got
[01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:37.640]  paul ryanow being selected by conservatives and conservative organizations like the heritage
[01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:43.800]  foundation pouring in behind him even though he's obviously the most open border person you could
[01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:49.080]  find in the republican side of the house they're going to make him speaker so i guess jeb bush
[01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:57.000]  thought that he could go full out on open borders and he could win the gop nomination now it's actually
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:01.560]  the border is stupid remember when they told uh back when clinton was running they said it's the
[01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:07.320]  economy stupid well it is the borders this time stupid because the borders reflect on the economy
[01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:13.640]  the open borders are going to destroy the economy it isn't targeted towards any particular
[01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:17.480]  ethnic group there's different ethnic groups involved in europe and there are here in america
[01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:22.760]  but the strategy is the same it is a strategy of open borders of a vast entitlement state
[01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:27.800]  and of course jeb bush doesn't want to do anything to pull that back he says how would i know that
[01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:34.520]  i'm not going to do so well and this uh i would have never guessed that the leader in the polls
[01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:39.960]  right now would be somebody who was who had supported a single payer health care system
[01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:46.760]  and abortions talking about trump well the reality of it is is that the gop leadership and people
[01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:52.520]  like bush have pushed for both of those things themselves prescott bush his grandfather was
[01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:57.960]  one of the founding fathers of planned parenthood we've shown you the documents where he was doing
[01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:03.320]  fundraising letters with margaret singer we've shown you the documents about george h w bush
[01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:09.480]  and in the first debate when he was criticized uh for being on the board of directors of an
[01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:14.520]  organization with bill gates whose dad was head of planned parenthood see they doesn't matter
[01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:19.560]  they're the republicans the democrats at the top they're both coming from the same issues or
[01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:26.440]  they're numb they're together on the key issues and one of those being abortion being eugenics
[01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:31.080]  and of course they were on the same board and this is a board that gave planned parenthood
[01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:35.080]  10 million dollars and jeb bush comes back and goes oh wait a minute wait a minute i didn't
[01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:42.680]  know anything about that i thought i was just enforcing common core a federalized dumb the
[01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:47.480]  people down curriculum from washington i thought i was pushing common core is like wrong answer
[01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:52.600]  thanks for playing but if you look at the amount of money that he said he took back he said
[01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:57.960]  we were giving him 300 000 and we stopped that so you understand that publicly
[01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:06.360]  he ended funding to plan parenthood of 300 000 but privately privately jeb gave them 30 times that
[01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:11.960]  amount of money so he wants to complain about trump being abortion pro-abortion single-payer
[01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:17.640]  health care system maybe he is maybe he is but at least trump will come out and oppose them
[01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:21.080]  on the open borders and trump may be lying to us we don't know if he's telling the truth or not
[01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:25.400]  we've been lied to by every one of these politicians they'll tell you anything they want to in order to
[01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:31.880]  get into office but at least at this point you want to know what the success of donald trump is
[01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:37.560]  it's because of the borders stupid that's what people are concerned about and let me tell you why
[01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:43.400]  this is an economic issue let's take a look at what's going on with obama care and it's not
[01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:47.960]  just obama care courses our educational system too where we got places like kentucky this is on the
[01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:53.320]  drudge report they have to they have 94 different languages that they're trying to teach people in
[01:16:53.320 --> 01:17:00.920]  the schools 94 in kentucky how are you going to pay for that well you're going to wind up living in
[01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:05.160]  a little cupboard under the stairs because you're not going to be able to afford to pay the taxes
[01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:10.120]  to live in the kind of home that americans have been living in because it's our property taxes
[01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:15.080]  that pay for the educational system and if we're going to educate everybody in the world that comes
[01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:21.000]  here if we're going to do what bernie sandernista wants to do and that is to give everyone a free
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:26.360]  college education uh i guess doctorate degree whatever you can start at three years old
[01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:30.840]  and you can stay in school until you're 30 by that time you should be a good little
[01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:36.200]  government clone and you'll be loaded up with debt so that when you get out of school you're
[01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:39.720]  going to be an indentured servant the rest of your life unless you go to work for the government
[01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:44.120]  but of course you'll love the government by then because you will have spent your entire life
[01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:48.280]  being propagandized by the government that's why they're doing it but it's also going to
[01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:54.200]  destroy the economy because they want to extend that free college tuition to anybody who comes here
[01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:59.240]  dreamers anybody who dreams of a college education can come here from any country
[01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:05.880]  and be educated at your expense and they will leave you homeless on the continent your
[01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:10.680]  father's conquered that's where this is headed let's talk about obama care let's talk about
[01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:16.280]  just that aspect of the socialist welfare state is it easy to cheat obama care and medicaid
[01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:22.360]  the general accounting office says it's no sweat how easy is it to cheat obama care
[01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:28.840]  or medicaid to receive highly subsidized federal health insurance well turns out it's very easy
[01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:35.080]  according to u.s. general accountability office and its undercover operations all 10 fictitious
[01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:41.320]  obama care applicants who worked for gao were approved for federal government subsidies and
[01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:46.200]  issued health insurance coverage many using phony social security and a fictitious employer
[01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:52.680]  they don't even bother to run the social security number through their computer there you go okay
[01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:58.040]  that's how easy it is seven out of eight other applicants to medicaid insurance were also approved
[01:18:58.040 --> 01:19:03.800]  and these tests were done in new jersey california kentucky there's kentucky again and north dakota
[01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:10.600]  they did it this year to check how their current 2015 anti fraud protections are working
[01:19:11.240 --> 01:19:18.040]  why would say they're getting a big fat zero aren't they you get zero percent detection of fraud
[01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:24.680]  for obama care applicants and they get a whopping 12 percent protection for medicaid that would not
[01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:32.360]  only be an f that would be an f minus minus minus i mean an f is like if you get like 60
[01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:37.000]  percent isn't it it's been a while since i've been in school this is like zero percent and of
[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:42.680]  course they say the results were similar to a 2014 investigation except there they caught one of them
[01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:49.240]  out of 12 so they had eight percent last year now the detection rate is zero percent that's how
[01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:56.360]  easy it is to game this entitlement system stay with us we'll be right back

[01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:33.400]  so we'll see what he says um as we were talking before we're about obama care i want to let you
[01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:39.000]  know about a new tax that's going to hit small employers and i want to go to that along with
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:44.600]  the obama care flops and what's behind the obama care flops and just a moment before i do i want

[01:25:46.680 --> 01:25:53.240]  dramatic increase in productivity in my youngest schools my youngest schoolwork kids love it and
[01:25:53.240 --> 01:25:59.800]  i love it that's right we had iodine was added to our diet and salt and in other ways and now
[01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:05.160]  that has been taken out of many of the nutrients so look at the reviews talk to your doctor see
[01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:09.480]  if it's the right thing for you and you can still get it right now it's available while we have
[01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:15.800]  supplies you can get it at info wars life dot com that's x2 nascent iodine now we're just talking
[01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:23.160]  before the break about obama care how easy it was according to the gao to defraud the system
[01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:29.240]  they had a basically zero percent chance of checking fraud people could give them a false
[01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:33.640]  social security number a false employer name they didn't bother to check it they just signed
[01:26:33.640 --> 01:26:40.040]  them up for obama care but there's another side to this that is causing this system to fail here's
[01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:46.200]  a story from yesterday on info wars dot com south carolina obama care co-op flops approximately 67
[01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:52.440]  thousand individuals and small businesses will have to find new health care coverage and obama
[01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:59.480]  care trend continues with an announcement to not offer health insurance in 2016 consumers choice
[01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:05.240]  health insurance company in south carolina becomes the ninth consumer owned and operated plan that
[01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:12.200]  is a co-op created under obama care to cease operations they say approximately 67 thousand
[01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:17.080]  people will be affected by this as i reported they say the recent announcement of a risk
[01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:23.720]  corridor reimbursement of only 12.6 percent is really what's taking them down economically
[01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:31.000]  they said this week's news should not be viewed as the failure of a startup but rather closure
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:37.160]  due to unfulfilled promises to say the obama administration they can arbitrarily change
[01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:46.440]  these rates now they said that they have this co-op will only get 362 million out of 2.9 billion
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:53.080]  that they requested so they're going bankrupt gee i thought that obama care was supposed
[01:27:53.080 --> 01:27:59.080]  to help us no it was designed to fail it is something it is nothing more than a transitional
[01:27:59.080 --> 01:28:05.320]  program in order to justify what they really want in the long run and that is a single payer system
[01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:12.360]  a system that is run by the government the system that hillary clinton as first lady tried to shove
[01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:20.520]  down our throats decades ago and now we've got it coming down our throats very quickly and just
[01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:25.880]  in time for hillary clinton become president these obama care exchanges will be failing
[01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:30.840]  left and right now this news comes from freedom works and they say surprise small employers
[01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:34.760]  will be hit with attacks for helping employees with their health care costs you would think
[01:28:34.760 --> 01:28:39.160]  that if the government really wanted to help you with your health care costs they wouldn't
[01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:42.760]  be finding employers who give you a little bit of money to help defray that would you
[01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:47.880]  we'll see that's never been the goal if that were the goal they could have gone with medical
[01:28:47.880 --> 01:28:54.120]  savings accounts they could have on your income tax they could have said deduct 100 percent as a
[01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:59.000]  tax credit you know they they push solar energy that way why not push health care that way why
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:03.960]  not say we're going to let you pay for your health care or even just your health insurance
[01:29:03.960 --> 01:29:09.800]  before you send your money to washington now they don't do that if you've looked at itemizing
[01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:13.880]  your deductions you know that you've got to get up to a pretty high threshold level before you can
[01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:19.160]  deduct any of your medical expenses they you have to exceed a very high percentage of your income
[01:29:19.160 --> 01:29:23.160]  and then those are simply deductions they're not credits i mean if you're getting solar power you
[01:29:23.160 --> 01:29:27.880]  can deduct 30 percent of what you spend on solar power but no deductions for this and it gets worse
[01:29:28.520 --> 01:29:32.920]  businesses with fewer than 50 employees that would be exempt from being forced to have obama
[01:29:32.920 --> 01:29:36.200]  care if they help their employees cover the cost of their health insurance problem listen to what
[01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:41.720]  they'll get a hundred dollar per day per employee fine that would be three thirty six thousand dollars
[01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:46.040]  for one employee they'll be fine for helping people with their insurance no they don't want
[01:29:46.040 --> 01:29:51.000]  you to have insurance they want this to fail so they can take it over the empires on the run
[01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:54.680]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:29:58.680 --> 01:30:03.160]  kid daniels info wars dot com did you know that half of all americans make less than thirty
[01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:07.640]  thousand dollars a year new government data also reveals that 40 percent americans are making less
[01:30:07.640 --> 01:30:12.200]  than 20 thousand dollars annually which is well below the poverty level for a family of four and
[01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:16.760]  according to the daily caller this new data doesn't take into account the eight million americans who
[01:30:16.760 --> 01:30:21.880]  are unemployed or the tens of millions americans who gave up trying to find a job in fact we're now
[01:30:21.880 --> 01:30:27.320]  experiencing the lowest participation rate since 1977 this means that america's middle class is
[01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:32.440]  systematically being destroyed and this is intentional nicole mackie evaley a 16th century
[01:30:32.440 --> 01:30:37.240]  pioneer on statescraft once said that it was in the government's best interest to keep its citizens
[01:30:37.240 --> 01:30:42.040]  poor but why well as the middle class disappears we're going to have a huge income gap in america
[01:30:42.040 --> 01:30:45.960]  between the ultra elite who hold most of the government's power and the dirt poor who are
[01:30:45.960 --> 01:30:50.360]  too impoverished to stop the expansive government at the expense of their rights once again this is
[01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:55.320]  kid daniels with info wars dot com and prison planet dot tv and keep checking back for more reports

[01:33:23.080 --> 01:33:30.520]  when we talk about war it's interesting we have to we have to keep the face of war and
[01:33:31.240 --> 01:33:37.560]  as somebody who grew up there in the vietnam era there was no more of a face of the atrocities of
[01:33:37.560 --> 01:33:43.960]  war than the young girl who was napalm there was that striking image of her running down the middle
[01:33:43.960 --> 01:33:51.080]  of the road naked because her clothes had been burned off she's now 43 years old there's an
[01:33:51.080 --> 01:34:00.280]  article on the bbc about her undergoing treatment hopefully a laser treatment that might get rid
[01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:05.720]  of the pain that she has been suffering i'm sorry she's not 43 years i was 43 years ago
[01:34:05.720 --> 01:34:13.800]  she was nine years old for 43 years she has been in pain from having napalm dumped on her as a
[01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:20.200]  nine-year-old girl see that's the face of war and i want to play that report for you and then i
[01:34:20.200 --> 01:34:27.400]  want to read you something from the daily beast that made me absolutely disgusted here's that report
[01:34:27.400 --> 01:34:36.920]  about this napalm girl a photo which in a split second captured the horror of vietnam a nine-year-old
[01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:44.520]  girl caught in a napalm attack the unbearable pain etched on her young face four decades on
[01:34:44.520 --> 01:34:50.520]  and kim fuk arrives in america excited at the prospect of new treatment for the injuries she
[01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:57.960]  suffered 43 years that i suffered so much from the pain last night i couldn't sleep so we'll see
[01:34:57.960 --> 01:35:07.480]  how it goes tomorrow yeah i cannot wait yeah why are you crying so happy yeah and here to meet her
[01:35:07.480 --> 01:35:13.960]  at miami airport the very man who took that famous photograph an image which one nick utt
[01:35:13.960 --> 01:35:31.000]  a bullet surprise a leading skin specialist has offered kim free treatment after hearing her story
[01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:36.440]  a third of her body was scarred people with much less severe burns have died she's in a lot of pain
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:41.000]  all the time for the last 40 years our number one goal is to get came out of pain
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:47.240]  so she can go on and return to her life it's hoped this laser surgery was softened scar tissue
[01:35:47.240 --> 01:35:52.200]  and crucially relieved the pain kim has suffered every day and you're doing amazing if you need
[01:35:52.200 --> 01:35:58.600]  to break tell us once again the photographer is there to capture the moment you know i i hope they
[01:35:58.600 --> 01:36:06.520]  can the doctor can help her the first treatment is deemed a success well done i feel much better
[01:36:06.520 --> 01:36:14.840]  about spiritual i really really looking i'm so excited and i'm so happy all the time
[01:36:15.480 --> 01:36:20.120]  there's still a long way to go though kim may need half a dozen further sessions
[01:36:20.920 --> 01:36:27.000]  a little girl whose image shocked so many 40 years ago is now a woman inspiring another
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:33.800]  generation with her optimism and love of life there you go she has conquered the people who
[01:36:33.800 --> 01:36:39.800]  would conquer her yeah we can think people like robert magnum era lbj the military industrial
[01:36:39.800 --> 01:36:45.400]  complex that's the fruit of what these people produce and i said there was an article that
[01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:52.200]  made me want to throw up from the daily beast and here's a title of it she kills people from 7800
[01:36:52.200 --> 01:36:58.920]  miles away her name is sparkle she operates a drone she's sick of whiny boys she's perfectly
[01:36:58.920 --> 01:37:06.760]  okay with dealing out death there you go murder is cool when it's done by a macho female when it's
[01:37:06.760 --> 01:37:12.760]  done by remote control 7800 miles away because you know then you don't have to see that uncomfortable
[01:37:12.760 --> 01:37:20.120]  picture of the little girl with her skin burning from napalm yeah you can just do your fire and
[01:37:20.120 --> 01:37:25.800]  forget you know and then this this article is absolutely disgusting and they say these plan
[01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:32.360]  strikes that they execute they talk about her day they make a big deal out of it what a wonderful
[01:37:32.360 --> 01:37:38.840]  thing it is that you've got this female who's conducting war from 7800 miles away isn't that
[01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:43.800]  a great thing they walk you through her daily routine and what they do they talk about their
[01:37:43.800 --> 01:37:49.560]  plan strikes they say they aren't the only the plan strikes aren't the only rpa strikes the
[01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:57.160]  u.s. also uses quote unquote signature strikes ones in which guys like spade can pull the trigger
[01:37:57.160 --> 01:38:02.760]  if a target merely behaves like a terrorist yes you don't need to have any reason to kill somebody
[01:38:03.880 --> 01:38:09.480]  i just i just assumed that they were looking terrorist like they were making movements like
[01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:15.640]  a terrorist what is what kind of movements does a terrorist make you know we we saw the video that
[01:38:15.640 --> 01:38:20.920]  that they're after julian assange for when uh he and manning you know manning leaked it and
[01:38:21.480 --> 01:38:27.240]  wiki leaks published it we saw them shooting people who were walking around they look this guy
[01:38:27.240 --> 01:38:33.960]  looked like a terrorist because he had a camera with him he was a cameraman so they shot these
[01:38:33.960 --> 01:38:38.120]  people up and when the ambulance arrived they shot the ambulance up and they were laughing
[01:38:38.120 --> 01:38:43.640]  about it on the tape and manning leaked that tape and wiki leaks put that out to the public
[01:38:43.640 --> 01:38:49.080]  and of course nobody got punished for that did they because that's a great thing if you do that
[01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:53.640]  kind of stuff they say in these cases it's much harder to be sure that an attack isn't hitting
[01:38:53.640 --> 01:39:00.520]  the wrong person or won't end a civilian life in the process you know what the biggest recruitment
[01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:08.040]  program we have for jihadi terrorists is our drone strike program it is absolutely insane
[01:39:08.040 --> 01:39:14.760]  but it is doing what it was designed to do doing what it was designed to do to increase the killing
[01:39:14.760 --> 01:39:22.520]  to increase the war to increase the chaos so they can justify more military spending from the people
[01:39:22.520 --> 01:39:26.440]  at darpa and the rest of the military industrial complex and we look at the military industrial
[01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:33.000]  complex and we look at the drone war of course there was that article that large expose of slides
[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:38.680]  from the intercept that were published last week and they followed up on that because it was a lot
[01:39:38.680 --> 01:39:43.400]  of data to try to go through with that and again we pointed out yeah we all know about that just
[01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:49.000]  like we all knew about the snowden leaks well before they happened well before the the snowden
[01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:53.960]  leaks the snowden documents came out we had been warned by nsa whistleblowers people like
[01:39:53.960 --> 01:39:58.520]  william benney people like thomas drake and others that we've had on the show many times we were
[01:39:58.520 --> 01:40:03.960]  told of what they were doing but people needed to see the documents they perhaps maybe it'll
[01:40:03.960 --> 01:40:08.120]  make a change if people see these documents that have been released about the drone strikes but
[01:40:08.120 --> 01:40:13.640]  they focused on one of these documents and they wrote another article about just one
[01:40:13.640 --> 01:40:21.240]  of these powerpoint presentations drones ibm and the big data of death and they say well if you're
[01:40:21.240 --> 01:40:27.720]  going to look at just one of these take a look at the one that is is our support to small footprint
[01:40:27.720 --> 01:40:34.600]  ct operations in samalia in yemen it was produced for the defense department in 2013 by consultants
[01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:42.280]  from ibm and here's how they summarize this they say it's a rare peculiar cultural artifact
[01:40:42.280 --> 01:40:46.920]  that opens a window into the deep guts of the military industrial complex with the technologies
[01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:54.360]  of assassination and corporate sales converge all described in languages dead as the target
[01:40:54.360 --> 01:41:01.240]  of an isr platform kinetic engagement yeah because kinetic engagement that's you know shooting and
[01:41:01.240 --> 01:41:04.760]  fighting that sort of thing they call those kinetic engagements those are different than the
[01:41:04.760 --> 01:41:09.320]  unconventional warfare the propaganda the lies that they conduct on you and of course they're
[01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:13.880]  doing that not just on other countries but they do that here domestically and so what they're
[01:41:13.880 --> 01:41:20.920]  saying is this is exactly like and let me read you this next quote as you can examine in this
[01:41:20.920 --> 01:41:25.960]  secret isr study you'll see that the pentagon's drone program uses data analytics
[01:41:25.960 --> 01:41:30.760]  in almost precisely the same way that ibm encourages corporations to use it to track
[01:41:30.760 --> 01:41:36.520]  their customers the only significant difference comes at the end of the drone process where the
[01:41:37.080 --> 01:41:46.360]  customer is killed yeah it's an end around the process end around our protections and this is
[01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:51.240]  all as we pointed out many times this is all part of the pre-crime programs that we need to be
[01:41:51.240 --> 01:41:56.120]  so concerned about again i'll go back to this article from the end of last week that we had
[01:41:56.120 --> 01:42:01.640]  an info wars dot com the uk goes full or well government will take children away from parents
[01:42:01.640 --> 01:42:07.240]  if they think they might become radicalized and they go through a some recent court decisions
[01:42:07.240 --> 01:42:15.320]  and of course these are aimed at islamists in the uk and they are going to establish this precedent
[01:42:15.320 --> 01:42:20.520]  by going after them but you need to understand that when they came out with this strong cities
[01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:25.480]  network when that was introduced by the department of justice by the attorney general at the united
[01:42:25.480 --> 01:42:31.480]  nations and is being run by european think tank and that european think tank was just like the
[01:42:31.480 --> 01:42:37.240]  southern poverty law center if you read their papers they could be written by the southern
[01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:44.040]  poverty law center you won't find anything in the strong cities initiative that is talking about
[01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:49.960]  islamic terrorists except to push back against the notion and call it islamophobia no they're
[01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:55.000]  concerned with people who are anti-immigration they're concerned with people who are anti-islam
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:43:00.920]  those are the people they consider to be radical extremists but understand how this is going to
[01:43:00.920 --> 01:43:06.840]  work in the uk right now they're focusing on muslims and they say in other words the high court
[01:43:06.840 --> 01:43:12.040]  judges within the family division are now tasked with determining whether children will be made
[01:43:12.040 --> 01:43:19.640]  wards of the state based solely on suspicions of possible radicalization children will be torn
[01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:23.640]  from their mothers and fathers and muslim homes and then later they will be torn from the
[01:43:23.640 --> 01:43:29.640]  homes of people that they consider to be right-wing extremists and that will all be subject to the
[01:43:29.640 --> 01:43:36.600]  whims and the inherently flawed watch of the larger citizenry the citizenry that has been
[01:43:36.600 --> 01:43:43.720]  put to sleep that's what we have to look forward to we need to carefully vet our leaders we need
[01:43:43.720 --> 01:43:48.440]  to understand how they lie to us how they use false flags to begin wars and as i was talking
[01:43:48.440 --> 01:43:54.840]  about these admissions from tony blair which aren't admissions at all he came out and said you know
[01:43:54.840 --> 01:43:59.960]  i'm sorry that i was given bad data sorry sorry not my fault mistakes were made and they weren't
[01:43:59.960 --> 01:44:07.400]  my mistakes is what he said some headlines on the daily mail faux sincerity weasel words the spin
[01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:13.720]  king strikes again michael burley talks about tony blair's controversial iraq war apology and that's
[01:44:13.720 --> 01:44:19.480]  precisely what i was saying yesterday is one of the most weasley apologies you could ever see and
[01:44:19.480 --> 01:44:25.800]  of course we know that it isn't even blowback that created ices we know that they are a tool of the
[01:44:25.800 --> 01:44:33.320]  cia and as i talked about a great length yesterday we know that ices and the islamic state a trans
[01:44:33.320 --> 01:44:41.640]  national caliphate that idea was being sold by a radical turkish imam fatala gulan who now runs
[01:44:41.640 --> 01:44:47.240]  over a thousand schools worldwide one of the largest networks of charter schools in united
[01:44:47.240 --> 01:44:53.080]  states half a billion dollars worth of money federal money goes to fatala gulen to run these
[01:44:53.080 --> 01:44:59.400]  islamic schools he was kicked out of turkey because he was pushing an islamic state a caliphate in
[01:44:59.400 --> 01:45:07.240]  1999 16 years ago he was pushing that idea and he wanted cia connection how did he get into the
[01:45:07.240 --> 01:45:10.840]  united states there were people in the government that didn't want him to come in but the cia gave
[01:45:10.840 --> 01:45:18.040]  him letters of recommendation to get into the united states so yeah the cia has been equipping
[01:45:18.040 --> 01:45:23.640]  and training and creating al-qaeda and ices and they are creating the educational institutions
[01:45:23.640 --> 01:45:31.080]  that will create the next generation of ices as well let's take a look at prohibition and when
[01:45:31.080 --> 01:45:35.640]  we look at prohibition we need to look at not only drug prohibition but gun prohibition
[01:45:36.840 --> 01:45:43.080]  until people understand that you don't allow the government to keep you from taking whatever you
[01:45:43.080 --> 01:45:49.240]  want to put in your body or forcing you to put something in your body without your consent without
[01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:55.080]  your informed consent as ben carson supports both of those he supports prohibiting people from taking
[01:45:55.080 --> 01:46:00.360]  drugs many of the drugs that they would take like medical marijuana people believe and have good
[01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:04.280]  studies to show that it would help them help their health but he wants to deny that to people
[01:46:04.920 --> 01:46:10.040]  on the other hand he likes vaccines so he supports the government forcing you to take
[01:46:10.040 --> 01:46:15.320]  vaccines without your informed consent but then he likes guns so he doesn't want the government
[01:46:15.320 --> 01:46:21.000]  to prohibit guns and then you've got michelle obama who wants to tell people what they can eat
[01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:26.040]  students what they can eat in their schools do you understand you don't get to make those kind
[01:46:26.040 --> 01:46:32.440]  of mandates and you're either going to swallow all the prohibitions and lose all of your freedoms
[01:46:32.440 --> 01:46:38.440]  or you're going to allow other people to have the freedom to do what they want without shoving it
[01:46:38.440 --> 01:46:44.520]  down their throat that's what ben carson doesn't realize when ben carson says we need to be consistent
[01:46:44.520 --> 01:46:48.200]  he goes hey look at these people who want to take your guns they're the ones who want to let people
[01:46:48.200 --> 01:46:51.720]  have drugs you know where's the consistency in that and it's like yeah you're right it's not
[01:46:51.720 --> 01:46:57.000]  consistent and neither is his position we need to have a position that consistently supports
[01:46:57.640 --> 01:47:03.880]  our individual freedom of choice our individual rights we have a system we just don't use it that
[01:47:03.880 --> 01:47:09.240]  system is called the constitution it's called the bill of rights but nobody wants to pay
[01:47:09.240 --> 01:47:14.200]  any attention to it apparently we need to bring the left and the right together on these issues
[01:47:14.200 --> 01:47:17.960]  we need to get them to understand that the principles about drug prohibition are the same
[01:47:17.960 --> 01:47:22.600]  as the principles about gun prohibition and take a look at where this is going can't the
[01:47:22.600 --> 01:47:29.240]  conservatives understand that we have destroyed so many of our foundations of our society we've
[01:47:29.240 --> 01:47:35.400]  destroyed the foundations of private property look at this article this is from truthvoice.com
[01:47:35.400 --> 01:47:40.920]  they say court rules that cops were wrong to seize a car over 20 of weed they say for nearly
[01:47:40.920 --> 01:47:45.080]  three years linda ross 26 has been fighting the seizure of her vehicle which police took
[01:47:45.080 --> 01:47:51.080]  after finding a small amount of marijuana inside they found the possession of one gram of weed
[01:47:51.080 --> 01:47:56.200]  in a two to one decision majority in a court that she appealed to wrote that because a customer
[01:47:56.200 --> 01:48:01.640]  had supposedly given her the weed as a tip for a pizza delivery that she hadn't actually driven
[01:48:01.640 --> 01:48:06.520]  her car with the intent of purchasing drugs the vehicle wasn't subject to forfeiture but guess what
[01:48:06.520 --> 01:48:13.640]  the police aren't giving it back they like to steal property that's what the civil asset forfeiture
[01:48:13.640 --> 01:48:17.800]  program is all about we've talked about this many times and you don't even have to have any
[01:48:18.840 --> 01:48:23.320]  any connection to this it could be somebody that was in your car that you weren't driving the car
[01:48:23.320 --> 01:48:28.360]  they could have your your high school student could be driving a car he could have a friend in
[01:48:28.360 --> 01:48:33.320]  the back who had a joint in his pocket they could confiscate your car that your son was driving
[01:48:33.320 --> 01:48:38.840]  because one of his friends in the back seat had remnants of marijuana in his pocket that's how
[01:48:38.840 --> 01:48:43.240]  insane this is because they don't have to take you to court they don't have to find you guilty
[01:48:43.240 --> 01:48:47.080]  they don't even have to charge you with a crime but now it's getting even worse we've talked about
[01:48:47.080 --> 01:48:52.280]  this many times but look at where this is headed we don't stop this so it gets even worse cops are
[01:48:52.280 --> 01:48:59.880]  now using prepaid car greeters to rob motorists of digital funds on the roadside civil asset
[01:48:59.880 --> 01:49:03.080]  forfeiture is coming under increased criticism under around the country they say is in the
[01:49:03.080 --> 01:49:09.480]  immoral nature of the drug war weapon becomes exposed civil asset forfeiture again is nothing
[01:49:09.480 --> 01:49:15.560]  but outright theft innocent people have their cash and their assets taken no conviction of crime
[01:49:15.560 --> 01:49:19.720]  they just steal it right there on the side of the road and of course new mexico has been one of the
[01:49:19.720 --> 01:49:25.160]  first states to make meaningful reforms because it was a very high-profile case of some people driving
[01:49:25.160 --> 01:49:31.640]  away from vegas they had won some cash the highway patrol knew that they were coming out of vegas
[01:49:31.640 --> 01:49:36.920]  thought they might have some cash and it was a scam that they set up with multiple law enforcement
[01:49:36.920 --> 01:49:42.920]  agencies robbed these people of their cash i can't remember i think they might have taken their car
[01:49:42.920 --> 01:49:47.720]  but listen to this this is the new twist the electronic recovery and access to data program
[01:49:47.720 --> 01:49:52.760]  prepaid card reader erad this tool developed by the department of homeland security is
[01:49:52.760 --> 01:49:58.440]  increasingly being deployed by local police departments erad allows cops to swipe prepaid
[01:49:58.440 --> 01:50:05.640]  cards check the balance freeze the account and steal the money how's that you know and the
[01:50:05.640 --> 01:50:09.960]  reason for that the justification for that is because you know drug traffickers are using
[01:50:09.960 --> 01:50:14.840]  prepaid cards while they're traveling instead of taking bundles of cash so they would take your
[01:50:14.840 --> 01:50:19.560]  cash because you know drug dealers sometimes use cash or they take your car because you know sometimes
[01:50:19.560 --> 01:50:24.200]  drug dealers use cars now they're going to take your bank account because sometimes drug dealers
[01:50:24.200 --> 01:50:30.200]  use bank accounts you know they're going to take your freedom because sometimes drug users use their
[01:50:30.200 --> 01:50:36.200]  freedom they're going to take your due process because sometimes our jails aren't full enough
[01:50:36.200 --> 01:50:41.000]  when are you going to have enough of this america when are you going to say we're not going to allow
[01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:48.800]  the police to be robbers. This is nothing but outright death. Highway robbery. Literally,

[01:50:58.880 --> 01:51:03.080]  Communist China freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates, while our U.S.
[01:51:03.080 --> 01:51:06.880]  politicians argue from banning Americans from owning body armor. Does that sound

[01:53:58.840 --> 01:54:11.160]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight, your host on this Monday, October
[01:54:11.160 --> 01:54:19.040]  26, 2015. I'm going to be joined in the next hour by Zoltan Istvan. He is the transhumanist
[01:54:19.040 --> 01:54:23.960]  who is running for president. He's here with his immortality bus tour, and we're going
[01:54:23.960 --> 01:54:28.560]  to talk to him about getting a chip and some of the other things that he's done. It should
[01:54:28.560 --> 01:54:31.400]  be an interesting interview that's going to be coming up in the next hour.
[01:54:31.400 --> 01:54:39.320]  I want to get back to the report that we showed you earlier of a drone showing the massive
[01:54:39.320 --> 01:54:45.400]  march of refugees in Slovenia. We have an article up on infowars.com, Kurt Nemo that shows that
[01:54:45.400 --> 01:54:50.760]  in detail. A drone video shows a huge column of illegal immigrants in Slovenia. Slovenia,
[01:54:50.760 --> 01:54:55.600]  Prime Minister, says that the crisis may destroy the European Union. This is dramatic footage
[01:54:55.600 --> 01:55:01.960]  captured by a drone. It shows a large column, an amazing amount of people marching in a
[01:55:01.960 --> 01:55:06.680]  column. Look at that when you see that. This is absolutely amazing. This is what is going
[01:55:06.680 --> 01:55:12.680]  to bring down the West. It's by design. You open up a massive entitlement state. That's
[01:55:12.680 --> 01:55:19.240]  what we spent the first hour talking about. A massive entitlement state. You couple that
[01:55:19.240 --> 01:55:25.160]  with open borders. You can run the economy over the cliff with your foot on the accelerator
[01:55:25.160 --> 01:55:29.680]  just like Thelma and Louise. It wasn't Thelma and Louise, but it was Cloward and Piven,
[01:55:29.680 --> 01:55:37.280]  a couple of sociologists, to propose doing precisely that back in the 1960s. We also
[01:55:37.280 --> 01:55:42.920]  have an article that's just gone up from Kit Daniels pointing out that Hillary Clinton,
[01:55:42.920 --> 01:55:49.120]  of course today is her 68th birthday. It's a really funny match at a picture of a birthday
[01:55:49.120 --> 01:55:53.560]  cake that was just covered with burning birthday candles. I mean, you couldn't even see the
[01:55:53.560 --> 01:55:59.480]  top of the cake crammed in there and I said, happy birthday, Hillary. Subtly reminding
[01:55:59.480 --> 01:56:05.040]  us just how old Hillary Clinton is. Well, as Kit Daniels points out, Hillary Clinton
[01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:12.240]  would be the second oldest person if elected. Only Ronald Reagan was older at an inauguration.
[01:56:12.240 --> 01:56:17.480]  Well, the problem with Hillary Clinton is not so much her age as it is the age of her
[01:56:17.480 --> 01:56:25.720]  ideas. Both she and Bernie Sanders have some of the oldest ideas, thoroughly discredited
[01:56:25.720 --> 01:56:30.600]  ideas that you will find out there. Yes, they are dyed in the wool government socialists
[01:56:30.600 --> 01:56:35.080]  who want to mandate and control everything. They're the most anti-choice people you could
[01:56:35.080 --> 01:56:38.200]  ever imagine. Of course, they call themselves pro-choice. Isn't that interesting? They call
[01:56:38.200 --> 01:56:42.200]  themselves pro-choice. Again, before we go back to some more news here, I want to let
[01:56:42.200 --> 01:56:47.640]  you know that we have an extended sale on our InfoWars Select Storeable Foods. Use a promo

[01:57:33.320 --> 01:57:39.240]  he's going to essentially ignore the 10th Amendment and double down on the war on drugs,
[01:57:39.240 --> 01:57:44.840]  like Chris Christie. It's a traditional Republican position. We're told that Ben Carson is an
[01:57:44.840 --> 01:57:49.560]  outsider, but if you look at his position, there is absolutely nothing unusual at all
[01:57:49.560 --> 01:57:53.560]  about any of the issues that he takes. He's not taking a side of freedom on anything. It's
[01:57:53.560 --> 01:58:02.840]  a typical boilerplate GOP platform. Could have gone to platform.com, checked the GOP button
[01:58:02.840 --> 01:58:08.360]  and print out what he's going to run for and stick that on his website. He may not be anybody
[01:58:08.360 --> 01:58:12.440]  who's ever been elected for president before, but it is exactly the same thing. Now he's
[01:58:12.440 --> 01:58:17.640]  comparing abortion to owning slaves and he's exactly right in the sense that he says,
[01:58:17.640 --> 01:58:20.520]  you can tell if you're the master, you can tell the slave to do whatever you want to and they
[01:58:20.520 --> 01:58:27.560]  have to do it. Well, apply that to his position on informed consent. He thinks he's your master.
[01:58:27.560 --> 01:58:31.960]  He can tell you to take vaccines and there's nothing you can do about it because you're
[01:58:31.960 --> 01:58:44.360]  going to be his slave. We'll be right back. Stay with us. This is GCN, the Genesis Communications

[02:00:23.640 --> 02:00:27.080]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm David Knight, your host today. We're going to be joined
[02:00:27.080 --> 02:00:32.840]  in the next segment by Zoltan Istvan, the transhumanist who is running for president and he is here
[02:00:32.840 --> 02:00:38.920]  with his immortality bust and he's going to tell us about getting a chip and his plans on why he
[02:00:38.920 --> 02:00:44.680]  wants to run as a transhumanist for president. It should be an interesting interview. We'll be
[02:00:45.320 --> 02:00:50.360]  beginning that in the next segment. In this segment, I want to go over some of the last news
[02:00:50.360 --> 02:00:56.760]  items that we had. Of course, we all know that millions of students are fleeing Michelle Obama's
[02:00:56.760 --> 02:01:01.320]  lunch program. You know, just like Hillary Clinton, who decided that as First Lady, she had the power
[02:01:01.320 --> 02:01:06.520]  to take over the medical community. When Bill Clinton was president, she was going to impose
[02:01:06.520 --> 02:01:11.720]  upon everybody a single payer system because we all know that monopolies are more efficient than
[02:01:11.720 --> 02:01:19.960]  competition, don't we? Only in the imagination of a socialist. But that's what she tried to do.
[02:01:19.960 --> 02:01:27.320]  And now they're taking a longer view towards that, creating mandates for Obamacare and then
[02:01:27.320 --> 02:01:31.640]  deliberately setting this up so that it's going to fail and people are going to have to go to
[02:01:31.640 --> 02:01:35.880]  the single payer system, which is what they wanted to. That was their goal all along. But of
[02:01:35.880 --> 02:01:41.320]  course, we see now Michelle Obama as First Lady decides that she should be the one who decides
[02:01:41.320 --> 02:01:49.000]  what your children eat. Where do these people get these ideas? What makes them think that they are
[02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:55.560]  king of the universe? Especially if they're First Lady. We didn't even vote for Hillary or Michelle
[02:01:55.560 --> 02:01:59.880]  Obama as First Lady. What makes them think they can dictate to us in this way? Of course,
[02:02:00.600 --> 02:02:04.360]  the children are not eating this. We've had multiple reports about how
[02:02:04.360 --> 02:02:11.720]  a school district, see, where was that? Was that Montana? I think they said,
[02:02:11.720 --> 02:02:17.160]  we don't want $180,000 worth of federal money because we're losing even more money than that in
[02:02:17.160 --> 02:02:21.240]  our school lunch program. And that's been happening all over the country. Now here's a story out of
[02:02:21.240 --> 02:02:27.640]  Fox News out of New Hampshire. They say the bureaucracy has run amok. A school dumps the
[02:02:27.640 --> 02:02:34.600]  federal lunch program and then is then deemed to be a processing plant. This is nothing but
[02:02:34.600 --> 02:02:39.800]  federal gangsterism. Listen to this. Nathan Greenberg believes that he runs a school district.
[02:02:39.800 --> 02:02:44.280]  But federal government bureaucrats look at his London Dairy, New Hampshire operation and see
[02:02:44.280 --> 02:02:51.880]  a food processing plant. They say that's a strange dilemma. The 5000 student district finds itself in
[02:02:51.880 --> 02:02:56.600]  after deciding at the end of last school year to pull the high school out of the unpopular
[02:02:56.600 --> 02:03:03.800]  national school lunch program. Why would we ever, ever have a national school lunch program?
[02:03:05.240 --> 02:03:10.200]  Why would you ever let one person decide what everybody else in the country is going to eat?
[02:03:10.200 --> 02:03:16.520]  That's absolute insanity. It's set up to fail. And of course, many people, many nutritionists,
[02:03:16.520 --> 02:03:20.440]  have talked about how her lunch programs are not healthy. But he says, we saw the
[02:03:20.440 --> 02:03:24.840]  federally mandated food go right into the garbage. We had some of the healthiest trash cans in the
[02:03:24.840 --> 02:03:30.200]  state of New Hampshire. Well, not actually. They weren't actually, they were very high in carbs
[02:03:30.200 --> 02:03:35.320]  and other things. She focuses on a couple of things like salt and sugar that she doesn't like,
[02:03:35.320 --> 02:03:40.280]  but then she puts all kinds of processed garbage into the food program that she has there because,
[02:03:40.280 --> 02:03:46.600]  you know, corporate sponsors. Anyway, so how did the federal government retaliate? Well,
[02:03:46.600 --> 02:03:53.400]  the U.S. Department of Agriculture came back and said, well, we think that you are a food
[02:03:53.400 --> 02:04:00.440]  processing plant. And it started to regulate them for that. See, that's the kind of gangster
[02:04:01.480 --> 02:04:05.880]  activities that we see from the government. You tell them that you don't want to do something
[02:04:05.880 --> 02:04:10.360]  in one area and they come back and they clobber you with that. That's why there's a 10th Amendment
[02:04:10.360 --> 02:04:16.920]  Foundation, 10th Amendment Center, with an article saying America has become exactly what the founders
[02:04:16.920 --> 02:04:21.560]  sought to destroy. They say over the last 90 years or so, the U.S. has been transformed into the
[02:04:21.560 --> 02:04:27.400]  very thing the founding generation of this country fought to destroy. We learn in history
[02:04:27.400 --> 02:04:32.600]  classes in school that the American Revolutionaries rejected the notion of a king, but that's what
[02:04:32.600 --> 02:04:38.120]  we have now. We have a king, we have a queen, we have bureaucracies who, as I pointed out before,
[02:04:38.840 --> 02:04:44.520]  are free to write their own laws. They create their own military or their own police force to
[02:04:44.520 --> 02:04:49.160]  assess the fines that they do, and then they drag you into their own court where you have no
[02:04:49.160 --> 02:04:55.240]  presumption of innocence. They have literally sent swarms of officers to harass our people
[02:04:55.240 --> 02:04:58.520]  and eat out their substances. That's what we have today. Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[02:04:58.520 --> 02:05:04.760]  To Daniels, infowars.com. Gun deaths are down 30% since 1993. That's right, all gun deaths,
[02:05:04.760 --> 02:05:09.640]  including murder, suicides, police shootings, and accidental shootings have dropped nearly a third.
[02:05:09.640 --> 02:05:14.680]  In between 1993 and 2000, the firearm murder rate dropped by almost half. But guess what?
[02:05:14.680 --> 02:05:19.400]  California, which has some of the strictest gun laws in the country, leads to nation and murders,
[02:05:19.400 --> 02:05:23.800]  according to the Washington Examiner. And generally speaking, the most violent cities in the country
[02:05:23.800 --> 02:05:27.560]  have the most severe gun restrictions. That isn't that surprising. I mean, if you're out committing
[02:05:27.560 --> 02:05:31.560]  violent crimes, you really want your victims shooting back? So isn't it ironic then that the
[02:05:31.560 --> 02:05:35.080]  mainstream media and the Obama administration are currently pushing for more gun control?
[02:05:35.080 --> 02:05:39.560]  President Obama is even considering enacting gun control via executive order. But not only is
[02:05:39.560 --> 02:05:43.960]  that illegal, it's also dictatorial. Former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay called that an
[02:05:43.960 --> 02:05:48.040]  impeachable offense. In an interview with Newsmax, he said it's time for the House to start letting
[02:05:48.040 --> 02:05:52.360]  the people know that this is a lawless president. And that's true, an imperial president isn't just
[02:05:52.360 --> 02:05:56.280]  a threat to our Second Amendment rights, but all of our freedoms. Once again, this is Kit Daniels

[02:08:18.120 --> 02:08:27.400]  Live from the infowars.com studios it's Alex Jones. Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm
[02:08:27.400 --> 02:08:33.960]  David Knight your host on this Monday October 26, 2015. Joining me in the studio is Zoltan Isfan.
[02:08:34.600 --> 02:08:40.920]  He is founder of the transhumanist party. You are now Zoltan taking a bus tour. Is that right?
[02:08:40.920 --> 02:08:45.080]  You're you're going across country with your with your I think it's the immortality bus. Is that
[02:08:45.080 --> 02:08:51.160]  what it's called? Indeed it is a bus that looks essentially just like a coffin and we're trying
[02:08:51.160 --> 02:08:57.800]  to provoke a conversation about life extension. Okay all right and we've got a video and I want
[02:08:57.800 --> 02:09:02.920]  to run this video and and ask you about what you're doing with this and and why you would do this.
[02:09:02.920 --> 02:09:07.160]  We've got a video of you getting a chip put in. Are you guys ready to roll that video? Can we
[02:09:07.160 --> 02:09:13.240]  can we do that? Okay let's roll that video. Do you have the chip already built into the thing?
[02:09:13.240 --> 02:09:18.840]  Yep it's already in the injector. Okay. So it's sterilized and ready to go.
[02:09:24.600 --> 02:09:27.960]  There we go. You see that little pop feeling? Yeah you know what I'm talking about.
[02:09:30.440 --> 02:09:34.200]  Yeah I've done much worse over the last few days. How long ago was this?
[02:09:35.480 --> 02:09:42.120]  About five weeks ago. I can't do the ladder. It's a pretty big needle. It's hard to show
[02:09:42.120 --> 02:09:48.120]  it. Look there's some blood. But it's a 60 second procedure. In fact maybe it's a 10 second procedure
[02:09:48.120 --> 02:09:55.560]  done quickly. It hurts more than a normal needle. That's for sure but that's a pop.
[02:09:57.000 --> 02:10:00.680]  And they're putting that in your hand for people who are listening on the radio. They're putting a
[02:10:00.680 --> 02:10:06.920]  chip in your hand. Indeed yes. And what is this chip going to do? Well it's very rudimentary honestly.
[02:10:06.920 --> 02:10:12.520]  It doesn't really do much. But for example with the bus if you have the right software and the
[02:10:12.520 --> 02:10:17.320]  right technology you can start your bus by waving your hand over the ignition instead of having a
[02:10:17.320 --> 02:10:22.200]  key. Or for example to get into the Alex Jones studio you could just swipe your hand at the security
[02:10:22.200 --> 02:10:26.840]  and that would let you right in. In the future though it's going to be able to do things like
[02:10:26.840 --> 02:10:33.480]  you can pay with it. You can it'll monitor your temperature your hydration levels and
[02:10:33.480 --> 02:10:37.080]  maybe even tell you whether you're getting enough iron from broccoli or something like that.
[02:10:37.080 --> 02:10:41.080]  So it's going to do a lot of different things like that. And then of course the government can also
[02:10:41.080 --> 02:10:46.120]  track your position all the time. So that is absolutely a concern. It's a concern of mine.
[02:10:46.840 --> 02:10:51.960]  But at the same time you know I'm sort of like the iPhone or the smartphones you know I guess
[02:10:51.960 --> 02:10:56.680]  there's a trade-off between your surveillance and security issues versus the government kind of
[02:10:56.680 --> 02:11:01.560]  prying into your life. Yeah exactly. That's always a trade-off. And you know I was one of the first
[02:11:01.560 --> 02:11:08.120]  people to get an iPhone. I got the very first iPhone on the very first day. I love technology.
[02:11:08.920 --> 02:11:14.840]  And I got to say when I'm finished with this contract I'm going back to some kind of a burner
[02:11:14.840 --> 02:11:20.680]  phone because I'm just fed up with the surveillance state. And so I'm willing now I've looked at this
[02:11:20.680 --> 02:11:25.240]  and it's like I will put up with a lot of inconvenience for my privacy because I think that's
[02:11:25.240 --> 02:11:29.160]  something that I don't want to give up. But let me ask you about health concerns. Aren't you concerned
[02:11:29.160 --> 02:11:33.880]  about the health issues of having that there? Because there's been some reports of animals
[02:11:33.880 --> 02:11:38.680]  who've gotten these kinds of chips and developed tumors at the site. This is something you put
[02:11:38.680 --> 02:11:44.440]  in fairly recently. There hasn't been a lot of history with these kind of chip implants. Are
[02:11:44.440 --> 02:11:50.120]  you concerned about possible health effects? So yes I am. But so far at least in the biohacker
[02:11:50.120 --> 02:11:54.520]  community I haven't heard of anything negative specifically with anyone that has received
[02:11:54.520 --> 02:12:00.280]  this chip. Now it's really the size of a grain of rice. It's tiny. That said I do want to say
[02:12:00.280 --> 02:12:05.560]  you know my wife is a surgeon and she said you know you do need to be cautious that what if this
[02:12:05.560 --> 02:12:09.720]  got free and went into the bloodstream and clogged an artery or something. So there are dangers
[02:12:09.720 --> 02:12:14.360]  like that. However I have not heard of one like that and I think a lot of people bring up a lot
[02:12:14.360 --> 02:12:20.360]  of the dangers. But so far there's very little evidence that would prove contrary to this.
[02:12:20.360 --> 02:12:24.600]  Again not that many people have had it and I'm very happy that I did it. I would probably do
[02:12:24.600 --> 02:12:28.680]  another one. I'm a big advocate for cranial implants. You know as you may know there's about
[02:12:28.680 --> 02:12:32.920]  half million people in the world right now that have cranial implants, brain implants.
[02:12:32.920 --> 02:12:37.240]  Most of them are cochlear implants that help with deafness so that people can hear.
[02:12:37.240 --> 02:12:42.360]  But some are already working towards epilepsy or working to help with Alzheimer's. So I think the
[02:12:42.360 --> 02:12:49.000]  error of implants is coming and it's not you know even though I got this tiny thing in my hand
[02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:53.000]  we're talking on the next 10 years many people are going to be doing. There's a it's a multi-billion
[02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:57.720]  dollar industry and the real question is how can we get the public to feel secure with them and
[02:12:57.720 --> 02:13:01.720]  especially how can we make sure the government doesn't abuse it. Yeah yeah and of course part of
[02:13:01.720 --> 02:13:07.160]  that is informed consent. I mean personally if I'm looking at this I want to know that there's
[02:13:07.160 --> 02:13:11.000]  enough of a history with something anything that I put in my body whether it's an implant or whether
[02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:16.600]  it's a vaccine or you know anything that is new I want to know what the history of this is. I want
[02:13:16.600 --> 02:13:20.280]  to see the studies I want to see studies that have been done by people besides the people who
[02:13:20.280 --> 02:13:26.200]  created the device or who created the the vaccine to know if it is something that's safe and the
[02:13:26.200 --> 02:13:31.000]  important part of that is not only informed part of that but it's also the consent part of that.
[02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:37.960]  As somebody who is running in a political party would you support mandatory implants of people?
[02:13:38.920 --> 02:13:45.560]  No of course not but what I would support is development from the government you know putting
[02:13:45.560 --> 02:13:50.680]  real money into for example through Obama's brain initiative $70 million is now going to DARPA
[02:13:50.680 --> 02:13:56.280]  and they are trying to develop a chip to help with depression from soldiers coming back from
[02:13:56.280 --> 02:14:01.960]  wars and conflict zones and I think that's an excellent use of you know cranial implants is
[02:14:01.960 --> 02:14:06.280]  to try to cure something like depression. Do you really believe that that's the mission of DARPA?
[02:14:06.280 --> 02:14:13.320]  No no I'm just I mean seriously I mean DARPA has used these kinds of things benign uses and come
[02:14:13.320 --> 02:14:17.000]  up with it and said you know we just want these killer robots because we might have to go into a
[02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:21.560]  nuclear powerpoint like Fukushima someday. If you go back and you look at the history of DARPA
[02:14:21.560 --> 02:14:26.920]  there's excellent book Alex's interviewed the author Andy Jacobson the Pentagon's brain going
[02:14:26.920 --> 02:14:33.240]  back to the 1950s the 1960s I mean DARPA is there to create weapon systems they're not there to
[02:14:33.240 --> 02:14:38.120]  help people and you know when I look at these brain system these these brain initiatives that DARPA
[02:14:38.120 --> 02:14:44.120]  is part of I have to remember that after World War II after the Korean War they were doing frontal
[02:14:44.120 --> 02:14:50.040]  lobotomies on people massive front the Pentagon was doing you got PTSD we'll give you a frontal
[02:14:50.040 --> 02:14:57.000]  lobotomy this allows them to do this electronically not having to use you know in a much cleaner way
[02:14:57.000 --> 02:15:03.080]  okay so I I mean again it comes down to the to the element of trust and and the whole fact that
[02:15:03.080 --> 02:15:08.040]  DARPA would come out with these programs and put a beard on it and say oh this is for peaceful
[02:15:08.040 --> 02:15:12.840]  benign use I just don't buy it well and I understand your worries and of course you're older than me
[02:15:12.840 --> 02:15:17.400]  so you've seen more of the history of DARPA but at the same time I think we are really just talking
[02:15:17.400 --> 02:15:22.600]  about depression for soldiers so it's hard to see how that could go wrong now I do understand about
[02:15:22.600 --> 02:15:28.680]  the war machines you're right there is a long history of developing you know war toys and
[02:15:28.680 --> 02:15:32.920]  frankly my political party and myself are pretty against war in fact one of our main initiatives
[02:15:32.920 --> 02:15:39.320]  is to try to divert money from defense and bomb making and wars to to help to science and technology
[02:15:39.320 --> 02:15:45.080]  so I'm definitely an anti I wouldn't say anti-military but a huge part of my platform is pulling
[02:15:45.080 --> 02:15:48.840]  money away from the military and putting it directly into scientists hands yeah I would
[02:15:48.840 --> 02:15:52.680]  like to pull the money away from the military and pull it out of the government's hands quite
[02:15:52.680 --> 02:15:58.200]  frankly I would like for us to be able to make our own decisions to make our voluntary associations
[02:15:58.200 --> 02:16:03.400]  to fund our own research if we wish to be able to afford to buy whatever we wished for our own
[02:16:03.400 --> 02:16:07.960]  health but of course you know as long as we send all our money to Washington and then have them
[02:16:07.960 --> 02:16:14.120]  make those decisions for us that won't happen let's talk a little bit about your transhumanist
[02:16:14.120 --> 02:16:19.480]  party let's talk about the platform here here's the first one implement a transhumanist bill of
[02:16:19.480 --> 02:16:26.200]  rights mandating government support of longer lifespans via science and technology I want to
[02:16:26.200 --> 02:16:30.120]  know what the bill of rights is but you kind of lost me there when you use the word mandating
[02:16:30.120 --> 02:16:35.320]  okay because I'm not really big on mandates especially when it's something that's coming
[02:16:35.320 --> 02:16:40.680]  from the federal government no of course and mandate is kind of a strong word but basically
[02:16:40.680 --> 02:16:44.360]  we want to have it so that and this is one of the reasons why I'm driving this bus across the
[02:16:44.360 --> 02:16:48.040]  country we're going to be delivering this transhumanist bill of rights to the US Capitol building in
[02:16:48.040 --> 02:16:55.240]  about five weeks and we want to make it so that politicians cannot step into the way of people's
[02:16:55.240 --> 02:17:00.760]  health we feel that politicians throughout history for example with George W. Bush stopping
[02:17:00.760 --> 02:17:06.520]  stem cell funding he has hurt people's health and we would like to make it so that no politician
[02:17:06.520 --> 02:17:12.840]  because of either religious or cultural positions can stand in the way of people's overall health
[02:17:12.840 --> 02:17:18.040]  now I know it's the stem cell research so let's understand that when he they stopped
[02:17:19.240 --> 02:17:23.320]  infant stem cell research okay there's still adult stem cell research and it's actually
[02:17:23.320 --> 02:17:28.040]  adult stem cell research that they've had all the advances from they haven't had any any advances
[02:17:28.040 --> 02:17:33.800]  from fetal stem cell research so you can do things in a way that doesn't violate people's rights
[02:17:33.800 --> 02:17:38.760]  for example we have prohibitions against doing things to people without their informed consent
[02:17:38.760 --> 02:17:42.360]  because the things that were done during the Nuremberg trials they were making the case
[02:17:44.120 --> 02:17:48.600]  they made the case with Nazi scientists with German scientists that in the greater good of
[02:17:48.600 --> 02:17:52.600]  humanity they could do things to people without their informed consent horrific things to people
[02:17:52.600 --> 02:17:57.720]  without their informed consent so there are some ethical checks that we want to put on medical
[02:17:58.440 --> 02:18:02.600]  progress that people know we don't just say well if we're going to benefit potentially from this
[02:18:02.600 --> 02:18:07.320]  medically we're going to remove those checks so it is valid I think to have some ethical checks
[02:18:07.320 --> 02:18:11.960]  do you agree no absolutely we want ethical checks and it's not that we're trying to eliminate all
[02:18:11.960 --> 02:18:18.520]  sense of culture or religious background anything like that it just happens to be that for example
[02:18:18.520 --> 02:18:22.840]  in the case of the Pope when he is you know they have been essentially against birth control which
[02:18:22.840 --> 02:18:28.680]  is essentially against condom usage and now you have 200 million Catholics in Africa and an AIDS
[02:18:28.680 --> 02:18:33.320]  epidemic that's out of control this is the kind of stuff that's actually harming people and making
[02:18:33.320 --> 02:18:37.960]  them die sooner because people aren't using condoms and of course they're getting AIDS so we want to
[02:18:37.960 --> 02:18:42.520]  create a mandate and it's not necessarily needs to be a mandate but we just wish that there would
[02:18:42.520 --> 02:18:49.480]  be some kind of cultural environment out there where leaders would not step in the way of scientific
[02:18:49.480 --> 02:18:53.320]  progress that is directly related to your health because when it comes down to health I think
[02:18:53.320 --> 02:18:57.800]  everyone agrees this is for our children for the loved ones for our friendships this is the most
[02:18:57.800 --> 02:19:01.800]  important thing so we just want to get people to understand that something shouldn't get in the
[02:19:01.800 --> 02:19:06.760]  way of health why I would agree with you who are looking at things like again going back to informed
[02:19:06.760 --> 02:19:13.880]  consent not letting them mandate that we take certain medical treatments not letting them prohibit
[02:19:13.880 --> 02:19:18.200]  that we get certain FDA drugs if we if I have a life-threatening situation I don't want to take
[02:19:18.200 --> 02:19:22.200]  an experimental drug and even if it hasn't been vetted that should be my decision to take that
[02:19:22.200 --> 02:19:28.920]  drug so I feel that if we don't make decisions about what we put into our own bodies and we are
[02:19:28.920 --> 02:19:32.440]  nothing but slaves to people I don't think that the federal government ought to be able to make any
[02:19:32.440 --> 02:19:39.640]  of those determinations but I think it's also very important that we I'm concerned about the idea
[02:19:39.640 --> 02:19:44.120]  that we would would mandate support from the government because I've seen how that turns
[02:19:44.120 --> 02:19:46.840]  around very quickly we're out of time for this segment we're going to come back we're going to

[02:24:38.920 --> 02:24:42.200]  you're still writing the bill of rights as part of the process as you're going there but tell us
[02:24:42.200 --> 02:24:47.480]  a little bit about some of the types of things that we would expect to see on this bill of rights
[02:24:47.480 --> 02:24:52.520]  well sure i mean as we spoke earlier the the first thing we'd like to do is create some kind of
[02:24:53.160 --> 02:24:58.680]  mandate that would say the government must uh you know look towards spending resources on your
[02:24:58.680 --> 02:25:02.840]  health specifically your longevity your lifespan and i think that's really important because right
[02:25:02.840 --> 02:25:07.640]  now you know um they're interested in your your happiness and in the welfare of the country but
[02:25:07.640 --> 02:25:12.280]  not necessarily individually in your lifespans and we really think the length of your lifespans
[02:25:12.280 --> 02:25:15.720]  and the quality of it is is most important so that's what we it's going to be at the top
[02:25:15.720 --> 02:25:19.800]  of the transhumanist bill rights but other things that we're supportive of is getting government
[02:25:19.800 --> 02:25:24.840]  research into for example the field of cryonics where you can free someone who is dead and hopes
[02:25:24.840 --> 02:25:30.440]  to bring them back to life in 50 years but also um different types of things maybe even like ectogenesis
[02:25:30.440 --> 02:25:37.320]  ectogenesis artificial wombs um this might free women up from having to go through labor and and
[02:25:37.320 --> 02:25:43.160]  having a baby it's frankly still quite dangerous so we just want research money into that stuff but
[02:25:43.160 --> 02:25:48.120]  right now there's not much going and so a transhumanist bill of rights is going to piece by piece try to
[02:25:48.120 --> 02:25:54.920]  say hey america you need to spend money on medicine and especially radical medicine that is improving
[02:25:54.920 --> 02:26:00.600]  human lives i i guess when i look at it and we talk about the government doing research and
[02:26:00.600 --> 02:26:05.880]  and directing research i i look at the way the government manages the pentagon for example
[02:26:06.840 --> 02:26:11.400]  and i look at a lot of misplaced priorities even with the space program especially with a space
[02:26:11.400 --> 02:26:15.640]  program there was a great deal of waste in that that's one of the areas where i have a problem
[02:26:15.640 --> 02:26:19.480]  with it the other area i have a problem with is the whole idea of rights being something that we
[02:26:19.480 --> 02:26:24.680]  demand from government you know as i was talking about earlier in the program we've always the
[02:26:24.680 --> 02:26:29.640]  initial understanding of of rights and our bill of rights was to prohibit the government from
[02:26:29.640 --> 02:26:34.840]  doing certain things to us in other words leave us alone we have these certain inalienable rights
[02:26:34.840 --> 02:26:40.200]  that we get from our creators so so leave us alone with this and uh they were prohibitions
[02:26:40.200 --> 02:26:47.640]  against government actions now we have a kind of a uh a concept of rights that says give me this
[02:26:47.640 --> 02:26:52.520]  give me that give me you know fund my research of my pet project and then the third thing i would
[02:26:52.520 --> 02:26:59.240]  say and i'll let you respond to this would be when you have a very individualized very individualistic
[02:26:59.240 --> 02:27:03.560]  approach to all this and yet it seems like there's a contradiction that you want the government
[02:27:04.120 --> 02:27:08.760]  to do this for you rather than organize self organizing at an individual level where you
[02:27:08.760 --> 02:27:13.160]  would have greater freedom because when the government gets in it's going to take away
[02:27:13.160 --> 02:27:17.400]  some of that freedom besides malinvestment no no there's there's certainly some type of
[02:27:17.400 --> 02:27:23.080]  contradiction here and i think a lot of it comes from the fact that um i began um a lot of my uh
[02:27:23.080 --> 02:27:27.720]  i suppose futurist career and wrote a novel the transhumanist wager which is very libertarian
[02:27:27.720 --> 02:27:32.920]  but that said now that i'm actually in politics and an aspiring politician i've had to become a
[02:27:32.920 --> 02:27:38.680]  little bit more realistic um and implement some policies and ideas that are more centric and
[02:27:38.680 --> 02:27:44.200]  bring people closer to the fold as and especially bring government more uh closer to my campaign
[02:27:44.200 --> 02:27:48.280]  it's in the sense that i have to work with it now i know that's upset people like yourself that
[02:27:48.280 --> 02:27:54.360]  might be more libertarian minded um but at the same time realistically speaking to try to make
[02:27:54.360 --> 02:27:58.680]  inroads as an aspiring politician there's going to be a certain amount of compromise and that's
[02:27:58.680 --> 02:28:04.280]  where i bring in this idea that you know i just got to be a bit more pro-government
[02:28:04.280 --> 02:28:09.160]  rather than this uh this kind of you know staunch libertarian that i used to be and that's
[02:28:09.160 --> 02:28:13.800]  sort of where i am right now in both my campaign and also in the transhumanist party and then the
[02:28:13.800 --> 02:28:19.080]  things that i'm trying to push forward is this is this kind of mix and this compromise okay one
[02:28:19.080 --> 02:28:23.160]  of the things that we uh didn't talk about when i introduced you i didn't talk about really your
[02:28:23.160 --> 02:28:27.880]  background you've been a writer for national geographic for psychology today for vices mother
[02:28:27.880 --> 02:28:33.640]  board you've worked as a blogger a futurist a transhumanist you've got a novel that you wrote
[02:28:33.640 --> 02:28:38.600]  and we're going to talk about that novel in the in the uh next section um you've done a lot of
[02:28:38.600 --> 02:28:44.680]  different things it's very interesting and i do want to get into your novel which is the transhumanist
[02:28:44.680 --> 02:28:51.240]  wager that came out in 2013 a science fiction novel i think uh that will give us some insight into
[02:28:51.240 --> 02:28:58.280]  your philosophy as a as a transhumanist but let's in this segment let's go through a few more of the
[02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:05.240]  of the things on your platform here you want to get rid of the drug war legalized mild recreational
[02:29:05.240 --> 02:29:10.920]  drugs like marijuana i would agree with that except i wouldn't put the qualification of recreational
[02:29:10.920 --> 02:29:15.080]  drugs i mean i understand that if the government wants to prohibit anything they need to do it
[02:29:15.080 --> 02:29:19.160]  constitutionally like they did with alcohol create a government where all politicians
[02:29:19.160 --> 02:29:24.280]  original professions are represented equally how do we do that well that's a very difficult one
[02:29:24.280 --> 02:29:29.400]  basically we're just trying to stop the fact that 40 percent of politicians are attorneys we just want
[02:29:29.400 --> 02:29:34.840]  a clear field of people being represented from every walk of life in the professions in the
[02:29:34.840 --> 02:29:39.800]  government i just don't think uh i understand yeah certainly the voters want somebody who's
[02:29:39.800 --> 02:29:44.040]  outside that paradigm we're going to be right back we're talking to zoltan is found and we're
[02:29:44.040 --> 02:29:49.320]  going to talk about what transhumanism is about stay with us we'll be right back we're on the march
[02:29:49.320 --> 02:29:54.600]  the empire's on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:29:58.680 --> 02:30:03.400]  after the release of numerous videos showing questionable Planned Parenthood practices
[02:30:03.400 --> 02:30:08.760]  multiple facilities have been raided raiders reports texas officials raided several Planned
[02:30:08.760 --> 02:30:13.960]  Parenthood facilities on thursday and a move that comes days after the state republican leaders
[02:30:13.960 --> 02:30:18.360]  bar the women's health group from receiving state Medicaid money the inspector general's
[02:30:18.360 --> 02:30:23.480]  office declined to comment but its agents were seen on local news reports entering a Planned
[02:30:23.480 --> 02:30:28.680]  Parenthood facility in san antonio texas said it would launch a probe of Planned Parenthood
[02:30:28.680 --> 02:30:34.280]  after the release of videos in july by an anti-abortion activist group center for medical progress
[02:30:34.280 --> 02:30:39.960]  in which a Planned Parenthood official is seen talking about transactions involving fetal tissue
[02:30:39.960 --> 02:30:44.840]  and speaking on a personal note Planned Parenthood continues to say that the videos were edited
[02:30:44.840 --> 02:30:50.040]  which they were much like you would edit a state of a union address down to a few sound bites but
[02:30:50.040 --> 02:30:56.600]  that doesn't mean that they were taken out of context you can find more reports on info wars.com

[02:33:32.280 --> 02:33:37.000]  about what a transhumanist is what his philosophy is we've been talking about the
[02:33:37.640 --> 02:33:42.920]  platform of his transhumanist party i have uh one or two more questions about that but then
[02:33:42.920 --> 02:33:48.520]  i want to get on to uh his novel that he's written the transhumanist wager as well as his philosophy

[02:35:03.800 --> 02:35:07.480]  the things i want to talk to you about uh and well quick question here we were talking just
[02:35:07.480 --> 02:35:13.240]  before the break about getting rid of lawyers certainly we see that people are fed up with
[02:35:13.240 --> 02:35:19.560]  career politicians are fed up with lawyers for some reason though uh there seems to politics
[02:35:19.560 --> 02:35:25.560]  seems to attract them okay it seems to attract people who want to control others quite frankly
[02:35:25.560 --> 02:35:29.880]  and so we have a lot of lawyers i mean what what do you do about that i mean do you set up a quota
[02:35:29.880 --> 02:35:34.920]  system i mean how how would you how would you do that as a as a platform well you know what you
[02:35:34.920 --> 02:35:41.000]  would try to do is make it so that um there was a limit to the amount of lawyers that you could have
[02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:46.360]  in the federal government you know and basically if you were going to be running in a certain uh
[02:35:46.360 --> 02:35:51.000]  position if you were an attorney that was your career then you would certainly not be allowed
[02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:55.480]  maybe it would be through some type of a system where um you know you roll dice or something
[02:35:55.480 --> 02:36:02.920]  like that but you have to have a system that does not allow 40 of the country to be run by a certain
[02:36:02.920 --> 02:36:08.200]  type of person and lawyers represent a certain type of person so i can imagine they would have a lot
[02:36:08.200 --> 02:36:12.680]  of fun with lawsuits on that of course they would be seriously when i wrote this article um originally
[02:36:12.680 --> 02:36:17.800]  about it um you know it caused a lot of upset a lot of people but you need some type of system
[02:36:17.800 --> 02:36:21.800]  that will not allow that into thing i want to see journalists in government i want to see
[02:36:21.800 --> 02:36:26.200]  doctors in government i want to see plumbers in government i want to see nurses in government
[02:36:26.200 --> 02:36:31.960]  i want to see across the spectrum all types of jobs running the country that's a fair democracy
[02:36:31.960 --> 02:36:36.440]  not 40 percent attorneys yeah i agree i agree one of the things that has to motivate people
[02:36:36.440 --> 02:36:40.920]  you have to look at is is what's their motivation to get at i think a lot of people just look at
[02:36:40.920 --> 02:36:45.800]  this system and it's a natural career progression for for people in the law unfortunately but most
[02:36:45.800 --> 02:36:51.240]  people who aren't lawyers just don't want to get involved in this messy system let me ask you one
[02:36:51.240 --> 02:36:55.960]  more thing on your platform here i thought was kind of unusual you would like to advocate for
[02:36:55.960 --> 02:36:59.720]  morphological freedom the right to do anything to your body as long as it doesn't harm other people
[02:36:59.720 --> 02:37:04.280]  are there provisions on that now i mean what what is the well there are certainly some things um you
[02:37:04.280 --> 02:37:09.960]  know we have the concept of euthanasia in america which is of course uh uh sketchy and uh states
[02:37:09.960 --> 02:37:14.440]  control it there's also you know the ability of some things that you might want to do to your
[02:37:14.440 --> 02:37:19.240]  body you would need a fda approval you need like kind of doctors approval and um you know the biohacker
[02:37:19.240 --> 02:37:24.680]  community doesn't want to uh be told what kinds of chips to be put into their bodies or not
[02:37:24.680 --> 02:37:30.840]  but i just get rid of the fda completely i mean you could have it be an inspection uh situation
[02:37:30.840 --> 02:37:34.520]  right you could have just like these school lunches i can understand why you would have
[02:37:35.080 --> 02:37:38.920]  somebody coming around and and looking to make sure that things are not being done in an
[02:37:38.920 --> 02:37:44.200]  unhealthy way but to tell people what they're going to eat in their in their school lunch program
[02:37:44.200 --> 02:37:48.120]  or to tell people what drugs are you're going to be allowed to take or not take i mean to me that
[02:37:48.120 --> 02:37:52.040]  that just doesn't make any sense no and you could have you could have inspections to make sure that
[02:37:52.040 --> 02:37:55.640]  people are not being given poison that there's not fraud and that sort of thing but
[02:37:55.640 --> 02:38:00.040]  beyond that i don't understand no and i you're getting rid of the fda is is something you're
[02:38:00.040 --> 02:38:04.920]  going to be seeing for me in the next two months in an article um i would like to completely either
[02:38:04.920 --> 02:38:09.480]  get rid of it or reinvent it because from a transhumanist the most important thing we
[02:38:09.480 --> 02:38:14.920]  have is that drugs and um technology gets approved and into the system so that we can
[02:38:14.920 --> 02:38:20.920]  use it to live longer and live better as quickly as possible um but the fda some stuff takes eight
[02:38:20.920 --> 02:38:24.760]  to ten years to get approved and this is why china is catching up on the united states is
[02:38:24.760 --> 02:38:28.760]  because it only takes 18 months to get a drug approved there um whereas it takes eight years
[02:38:28.760 --> 02:38:33.880]  here you can't run a system they can't run a country when there's that much regulation involved so
[02:38:33.880 --> 02:38:38.200]  yes rewriting the rules of the fda or getting rid of it or something like that is something that i
[02:38:38.200 --> 02:38:43.480]  definitely uh well certainly that this case that we just had with the um the hedge fund uh young guy
[02:38:43.480 --> 02:38:47.160]  that made a lot of money as a hedge fund manager went out and bought a pharmaceutical company and
[02:38:47.160 --> 02:38:51.880]  then promptly raised i think it was like 5 000 percent it went from 13 uh dollars and 50 cents
[02:38:51.880 --> 02:38:57.960]  a pill to uh 750 dollars a pill one of the reasons he is able to do that is because of fda regulations
[02:38:57.960 --> 02:39:02.760]  making it difficult even for people to make generic drugs because this is something that the
[02:39:02.760 --> 02:39:07.400]  patent had expired a long long time many decades ago but still if somebody wanted to come in and
[02:39:07.400 --> 02:39:13.800]  make a generic drug they were prohibited from doing that uh because of fda regulation so certainly
[02:39:13.800 --> 02:39:18.440]  it is inhibited people's access to health care and again this hurts health and this is really
[02:39:18.440 --> 02:39:23.400]  what my entire platform is about i just want to make health easier and better to achieve so
[02:39:23.400 --> 02:39:29.640]  anything that goes against health is in my opinion going to be wrong okay let's talk about your uh
[02:39:29.640 --> 02:39:35.080]  your novel and let's talk about your philosophy of transhumanism your novel is a transhumanist
[02:39:35.080 --> 02:39:40.600]  wager it's a 2013 science fiction novel uh to just kind of break this down briefly for people
[02:39:40.600 --> 02:39:45.080]  i'm looking at what i found on the wikipedia description so you can correct this it follows
[02:39:45.080 --> 02:39:50.680]  the life of protagonist uh jethro knights no relation to me uh a philosopher whose effort
[02:39:50.680 --> 02:39:57.160]  is to promote transhumanism which ultimately leads to a global revolution the protagonist
[02:39:57.160 --> 02:40:03.000]  studies philosophy sells around the world to promote life extension uh and his love interest
[02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:07.000]  as a physician sounds autobiographical sounds like you you've traveled around the world with
[02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:13.400]  um uh national geographic you're married to a physician well yes it is a third of the
[02:40:13.400 --> 02:40:18.600]  of it is probably out of back yes yes now the interesting thing i find uh looking at this
[02:40:18.600 --> 02:40:24.600]  is you say transhumanists in your novel are being targeted and killed by christian terrorists so
[02:40:24.600 --> 02:40:29.000]  what is it about christians that you would think they would they would target and kill somebody
[02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:34.600]  who is a transhumanist well you know again the the novel is set up first off it's a novel it's
[02:40:34.600 --> 02:40:39.400]  fiction and um it's set up so that there are some christian fundamentalists out there and
[02:40:39.400 --> 02:40:43.160]  there probably are out there in the world that would really like to stop all technology when
[02:40:43.160 --> 02:40:47.320]  i talk about trying to live in deathly or conquer death some christians get upset at that because
[02:40:47.320 --> 02:40:51.800]  i think well why do you need to conquer death if we're going to go to jesus when we die and so
[02:40:51.800 --> 02:40:58.760]  transhumus most don't believe that i i'm an atheist and um so the novel setup is that is to kind of
[02:40:58.760 --> 02:41:04.120]  show that that conflict and of course that conflict grows bigger and bigger through the novel and
[02:41:04.120 --> 02:41:08.520]  eventually you get to a point when the christians say no more science no more transhumanism you
[02:41:08.520 --> 02:41:12.600]  can have basic health care but you can't have radical life extension you can't have artificial
[02:41:12.600 --> 02:41:17.320]  intelligence you can't robots taking over and taking all our jobs and that's where the conflict
[02:41:17.320 --> 02:41:21.640]  erupts and so that's what the book's really about that's an interesting take on christianity because
[02:41:21.640 --> 02:41:27.240]  as a christian i i'm not anti science i'm concerned about the misuse of technology as we talked about
[02:41:27.240 --> 02:41:34.600]  earlier with darpa and and i don't think that that christianity is is uh antithetical to scientific
[02:41:34.600 --> 02:41:40.120]  inquiry i mean we've had people like isaac newton or james maxwell who did maxwell's equations uh
[02:41:40.120 --> 02:41:46.920]  connecting a unified theory between magnetism and and uh electricity uh they were very strong
[02:41:46.920 --> 02:41:52.120]  christians i mean they they were as as they they wrote as much christian commentary as they did
[02:41:52.120 --> 02:41:56.280]  scientific commentary perhaps uh more so in the case of isaac newton so i don't really see that
[02:41:56.280 --> 02:42:02.760]  there's any conflict inherent in in christianity i i look at people that are paranoid about christians
[02:42:02.760 --> 02:42:08.520]  terrorizing them and it makes me you know think about the the the movie in american carol by uh
[02:42:08.520 --> 02:42:13.160]  david zucer where there was this i don't know if you ever do you ever see that movie michael more
[02:42:13.160 --> 02:42:17.400]  there was a michael more character and it was a satire as a parody and the michael more character
[02:42:17.400 --> 02:42:21.560]  was doing a documentary that was very anti-american he was very concerned about christians at one
[02:42:21.560 --> 02:42:27.640]  point they've got they even show some nuns in his in his movie jumping on a bus and pulling out the
[02:42:27.640 --> 02:42:33.960]  pen of a hand grenade which the pen is across and yelling uh hell mary you know as they blow up the
[02:42:33.960 --> 02:42:39.960]  bus i mean you know that's you know when i look at that i i think that's that is a a fear that many
[02:42:39.960 --> 02:42:45.320]  people on the secular left have about christians that i just think is is really unfounded what would
[02:42:45.320 --> 02:42:49.240]  well you know and again this is where the book becomes a novel and of course it's designed as
[02:42:49.240 --> 02:42:53.720]  well to be entertaining so there has to be some conflict but you know since i've written the
[02:42:53.720 --> 02:42:57.720]  novel and i started writing the novel six years ago it took me four years because about 20 percent
[02:42:57.720 --> 02:43:03.640]  of the novel's pure philosophy um i've i've grown to realize that actually many christians are much
[02:43:03.640 --> 02:43:08.440]  more embracing of science than perhaps i realized uh when i was younger and at the same time i've
[02:43:08.440 --> 02:43:14.040]  also realized that the conflict between transhumanism and some of the doctrine in the bible is
[02:43:14.040 --> 02:43:19.320]  something that's going to have to be faced by every uh person that wants to you know use this technology
[02:43:19.320 --> 02:43:23.320]  in fact that's why the book's called the transhumus wager it's based sort of on pascal's wager but
[02:43:23.320 --> 02:43:28.040]  instead of about god it's about using technology to live indefinitely and i think we're all going
[02:43:28.040 --> 02:43:32.920]  to be faced with that and and many christians are going to have to say where does the scripture
[02:43:32.920 --> 02:43:38.680]  kind of fit within living indefinitely or or replacing an arm with a by with a robotic arm
[02:43:38.680 --> 02:43:43.160]  or even having cranial implants is that really the mark of the beads or is that something for our
[02:43:43.160 --> 02:43:47.800]  health and this is you know what the book tries to illustrate it doesn't necessarily um you know
[02:43:47.800 --> 02:43:53.640]  necessarily pick sides either way um of course it ends being protranshumanist but at the same time
[02:43:53.640 --> 02:43:59.000]  it it hopefully leads everyone to a path where they can say yeah technology is good and so can
[02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:04.680]  spirituality in fact the the wife of the protagonist is very spiritual so she counterbalances his
[02:44:04.680 --> 02:44:11.800]  atheism let me ask you and i think true you know what it says in the wikipedia uh description of
[02:44:11.800 --> 02:44:18.120]  the novel uh that your wife that the wife of the character challenges him says that death is a part
[02:44:18.120 --> 02:44:23.400]  of life i would say as a christian i don't see death as a natural part of life i see it as a
[02:44:23.960 --> 02:44:29.960]  as a judgment of god um that this is basically christian doctrine that you know the the earth
[02:44:29.960 --> 02:44:34.920]  has been basically destroyed uh twice because rebellion and and death as a punishment is
[02:44:34.920 --> 02:44:40.600]  not the natural state of man so i don't really look at christianity as a cult of of death but
[02:44:40.600 --> 02:44:46.680]  let me ask you about other people's concerns about transhumanism or about artificial intelligence
[02:44:46.680 --> 02:44:52.040]  we talked during the break briefly about hugo de garis's book the art alike war he's concerned
[02:44:52.040 --> 02:44:58.840]  about it he's certainly not a christian um he believes that he is he's he's drawn he he's kind
[02:44:58.840 --> 02:45:05.720]  of on both sides of this he's he's kind of drawn to creating something that he believes is going
[02:45:05.720 --> 02:45:11.240]  to destroy him and the human race but he sees it as the fact that he's going to be creating
[02:45:11.240 --> 02:45:17.320]  some kind of a godlike intelligence that he believes will turn on humans and uh nevertheless
[02:45:17.320 --> 02:45:22.840]  he's drawn to do that so he's he's kind of on both sides but overall he he tends to go towards that
[02:45:22.840 --> 02:45:28.280]  so he would have issues with uh some of the artificial intelligence so no and and i think
[02:45:28.280 --> 02:45:33.560]  artificial intelligence is something that is very um dangerous in fact i'm also the creator
[02:45:33.560 --> 02:45:39.400]  of this concept called theosidism which is this idea that god may have existed um as some super
[02:45:39.400 --> 02:45:45.400]  intelligence but then ended up um uh killing itself or you know just essentially becoming nothing
[02:45:45.400 --> 02:45:50.840]  in a way to give the rest of the world free will um and we may now be living in a universe that is a
[02:45:50.840 --> 02:45:54.680]  hologram uh anyways there's a lot of philosophy and physics that are starting to lead to some of
[02:45:54.680 --> 02:46:00.360]  these crazy concepts and you know hugo de garis when he talks about some of the worries between
[02:46:00.360 --> 02:46:05.560]  artificial intelligence and normal people he's a hundred percent right because we are facing this
[02:46:05.560 --> 02:46:11.160]  incredible challenge how far do we let um an intelligence grow beyond our own capacities
[02:46:11.160 --> 02:46:17.000]  and once it does does it even need us around i'm not a big fan of ai i'm actually um you know i
[02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:21.560]  want to spend a lot of money for research for ai to help the world but i don't want an intelligence
[02:46:21.560 --> 02:46:25.240]  smarter than me on planet earth that's just not what i think it's going to get out of control
[02:46:25.240 --> 02:46:29.400]  far sooner than that because i think even before you get something that is a self-aware general
[02:46:29.400 --> 02:46:34.280]  intelligence far before that you're going to have uh autonomous killing machines are created by
[02:46:34.280 --> 02:46:39.960]  darpa and others uh and that brings us to how do you control uh this type of thing you know isa
[02:46:39.960 --> 02:46:44.840]  kasmav had his three laws of robotics that a robot couldn't injure human being it had to
[02:46:44.840 --> 02:46:49.800]  take orders and then it had to protect its existence as long as that didn't conflict with
[02:46:49.800 --> 02:46:55.960]  the first two orders you have your own kind of three laws of transhumanism a transhumanist
[02:46:55.960 --> 02:47:01.880]  must safeguard one's own existence above all else how does it seem if that's the primary law
[02:47:01.880 --> 02:47:08.040]  it seems to me like an artificial intelligence or a transhumanist that would be a prescription for
[02:47:08.040 --> 02:47:13.560]  conflict a prescription for unending conflict if it's going to be that egocentric no and and let
[02:47:13.560 --> 02:47:18.920]  me state that the book is both you know the book where the it starts with the three laws in the very
[02:47:18.920 --> 02:47:24.360]  first lines is both a warning and an inspiration of the future um and i think the three laws of
[02:47:24.360 --> 02:47:27.880]  transhumanism they're certainly not a part of my campaign because there's no way you could run a
[02:47:27.880 --> 02:47:32.360]  government with the first law but the because i mean you need to be more communal you need to
[02:47:32.360 --> 02:47:37.160]  care about the people you need to uh you know be out for your your own tribe your own country
[02:47:37.160 --> 02:47:42.520]  but the three laws are really designed to have philosophers and readers explore what kind of
[02:47:42.520 --> 02:47:46.360]  age we're going to be entering when you talk about machine intelligence when you talk about
[02:47:46.360 --> 02:47:51.640]  intelligence that may think more robotic like it may not have mammalian feelings which is love
[02:47:51.640 --> 02:47:56.040]  tenderness you know our mothers and our fathers um it may just be like you know i'm out for my own
[02:47:56.040 --> 02:48:00.920]  good so the three laws were written as a challenge how far do we take these laws i've often said
[02:48:00.920 --> 02:48:06.040]  that the three laws of transhumanism are going to be embraced by artificial intelligence but not
[02:48:06.040 --> 02:48:11.320]  by human beings yeah yeah it looks like uh if they were to embrace that we would have the
[02:48:11.320 --> 02:48:15.960]  artificial intelligence that hugo de garis is concerned about that it would put its existence
[02:48:15.960 --> 02:48:21.560]  above everything else the second law would be that it would achieve omnipotence as exponentially
[02:48:21.560 --> 02:48:28.360]  as possible uh expediently as as possible and it may be exponential as a matter of fact uh talk
[02:48:28.360 --> 02:48:33.480]  about that why what what is that about why would it want to what would the second thing to be uh
[02:48:33.480 --> 02:48:38.360]  achieve omnipotence that sounds like it would be uh dominating not only egocentric but uh
[02:48:38.360 --> 02:48:43.800]  megalomaniacal as well well you know i mean when you talk about what transhumanists are after
[02:48:43.800 --> 02:48:49.960]  they're after a perfect state of health they're after a a kind of a state of being that nobody
[02:48:49.960 --> 02:48:55.080]  can tear down and you know that's virtually synonymous with omnipotence but at the same time
[02:48:55.080 --> 02:48:59.000]  i don't think it's omnipotence in the egocentric way that most transhumans are after what they're
[02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:03.960]  really after is just saying you know i now have perfect health and nobody can take it away from
[02:49:03.960 --> 02:49:07.960]  me perhaps we live in some type of perfect libertarian society where that was achieved
[02:49:07.960 --> 02:49:11.160]  that would be perfect then we wouldn't have to use the word omnipotence maybe there's a better
[02:49:11.160 --> 02:49:16.520]  word than that but the way the three laws are structured is they're structured sort of that
[02:49:16.520 --> 02:49:20.120]  it would be an artificial intelligence or some type of super being that would
[02:49:20.120 --> 02:49:25.400]  achieve this omnipotence and that's why it would try to become god now again this doesn't work at
[02:49:25.400 --> 02:49:29.560]  all for a political platform and it's not part of my political platform but it is certainly
[02:49:29.560 --> 02:49:33.800]  worth exploring as people decide how far they want to take technology again it's all part of
[02:49:33.800 --> 02:49:39.080]  the transhumus wager how far do you go to make that transhumus wager do you go to try to become
[02:49:39.080 --> 02:49:43.960]  god do you go to try to conquer death do you go to really reverse the the natural course of the
[02:49:43.960 --> 02:49:47.720]  human being and i think that's the choice every single person is going to have to make in the
[02:49:47.720 --> 02:49:52.840]  21st century as technology advances yeah that's that's why i was looking at the three laws of
[02:49:53.640 --> 02:49:58.280]  of transhumanism as you posit them out there try to get an understanding of what your philosophy
[02:49:58.280 --> 02:50:04.040]  was about and and i guess let's look at the third one let me get you to comment on this what does
[02:50:04.040 --> 02:50:10.120]  it mean to safeguard value in the universe so it's value the third one is the good one the third
[02:50:10.120 --> 02:50:15.400]  one means safeguard everyone your life my life my family's life my children's life um safeguard
[02:50:15.400 --> 02:50:20.280]  means taking care of anything that has value including the environment including uh other
[02:50:20.280 --> 02:50:24.680]  people that we've never met before including other star systems if we feel that's beneficial
[02:50:24.680 --> 02:50:29.800]  for the universe so the third one is really the humanitarian one or the mammalian one where um
[02:50:29.800 --> 02:50:35.560]  we go out of our way to protect um people in society and civilization it almost seems like it's
[02:50:35.560 --> 02:50:41.080]  taken asimov's laws and inverted them in a very dangerous way you you're not the first to say
[02:50:41.080 --> 02:50:46.440]  that that's okay okay we're gonna be right back we're talking to zoltan isfan transhumanist
[02:50:46.440 --> 02:50:52.200]  candidate for president and he's on his way to washington to deliver a bill of rights for transhumanists
[02:50:52.200 --> 02:51:02.920]  we'll be right back what would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality

[02:54:18.600 --> 02:54:24.120]  isfan an american writer futurist philosopher and transhumanist he's the um creator of the
[02:54:24.120 --> 02:54:28.920]  transhumanist party he is on his way to washington with a transhumanist bill of rights we've talked
[02:54:28.920 --> 02:54:32.680]  about that a little bit i've been talking to him about the transhumanist philosophy we're
[02:54:32.680 --> 02:54:39.480]  going to get back to that i want to find out about um his opinion of intelligence transfer
[02:54:39.480 --> 02:54:45.800]  it says ray Kurzweil is pinning his hopes that he's going to transfer himself into some kind of a
[02:54:45.800 --> 02:54:50.040]  mechanical body at some point before we do real quickly i want to let you know about the specials

[02:55:28.120 --> 02:55:33.960]  ray Kurzweil talked many times about uh uh transferring himself into uh some kind of an
[02:55:33.960 --> 02:55:40.040]  artificial body at some point time i look at this and i was like well my opinion of that would be well
[02:55:40.840 --> 02:55:46.760]  you if assuming that all of this stuff was there you might be able at very best to make an exact
[02:55:46.760 --> 02:55:51.960]  replica of yourself but it wouldn't be you and my understanding of it i mean what do you think i
[02:55:51.960 --> 02:55:55.800]  mean i look at this and it's i guess it this fundamentally gets down to what your understanding
[02:55:55.800 --> 02:56:01.800]  is of what a human being is are we merely a consciousness are we merely a mind are we merely
[02:56:01.800 --> 02:56:08.600]  a physical construct or is there a soul well you know i don't believe in a soul but i believe
[02:56:08.600 --> 02:56:15.160]  that if you were to transfer my exact uh ingredients of who i am directly into a machine at least for
[02:56:15.160 --> 02:56:22.360]  a single instant it would be exactly me um now there might be two of me exactly at the same moment
[02:56:22.360 --> 02:56:26.280]  but you know then a few seconds later you know history and nature and all these other things
[02:56:26.280 --> 02:56:30.840]  start happening you get new experiences then it becomes somebody different but it's very close so
[02:56:30.840 --> 02:56:36.600]  i'm a believer in life extension using mind uploading as one means of conquering death
[02:56:36.600 --> 02:56:41.240]  it's not ideal what would be ideals for me to never lose my consciousness as i am right now and to
[02:56:41.240 --> 02:56:47.400]  maybe transfer myself into something where i'm you know in a robotic body but it's perhaps i
[02:56:47.400 --> 02:56:52.920]  always have my brain intact somehow like that but um mind uploading is probably going to be the one
[02:56:53.560 --> 02:57:00.040]  that might work in terms of uh getting us to do things like space travel and getting us to do
[02:57:00.040 --> 02:57:04.520]  things like going off into total different areas of human existence that we've never been i mean
[02:57:04.520 --> 02:57:08.360]  imagine if you're living in a computer we have five senses right now with our human body in a
[02:57:08.360 --> 02:57:13.800]  computer you might have 500 senses experience reality could be something incredibly different
[02:57:13.800 --> 02:57:19.800]  and very exciting potentially yeah i'm very excited about living forever quite frankly i'm a christian
[02:57:20.440 --> 02:57:24.120]  so i think that i'm going to get a spiritual body and i think that's going to be something
[02:57:24.120 --> 02:57:29.480]  that is beyond anything that i can comprehend and and so i'm quite confident i'm going to get that
[02:57:29.480 --> 02:57:34.920]  actually it's a it's a confident expectation that i and again i guess it comes back to where
[02:57:34.920 --> 02:57:41.160]  you think we are in terms of a of a person you know when you go to garrus create his artificial
[02:57:41.160 --> 02:57:47.720]  brain project it was kind of a field of dreams approach in other words if he could reconstruct
[02:57:47.720 --> 02:57:53.480]  the human brain accurately enough he believed that consciousness would come you know like field of
[02:57:53.480 --> 02:57:58.760]  dreams i've built this thing and it's you know it'll just it'll just flow into that and so i guess
[02:57:58.760 --> 02:58:05.480]  when i look at that i i just never really bought that because to me there has to be something else
[02:58:05.480 --> 02:58:12.200]  there there has to be something else to to our to our existence that that creates that consciousness
[02:58:12.200 --> 02:58:16.360]  other than just all of the physical components that are there and i want to give you time to
[02:58:16.360 --> 02:58:21.080]  answer that we're going to keep zoltan is fine for another segment coming up right after the

[03:00:05.880 --> 03:00:13.560]  a war on for your mind welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night your host and we have
[03:00:13.560 --> 03:00:18.680]  with us we're holding over to this segment zoltan is fan the transhumanist and i posed a question
[03:00:18.680 --> 03:00:23.960]  to zoltan that he didn't have a chance to answer in the last segment so we're going to uh get that
[03:00:23.960 --> 03:00:31.080]  answer and again the basically what i was asking you zoltan was um do you believe that uh you know
[03:00:31.080 --> 03:00:37.480]  what is your basic philosophy in terms of what constitutes us okay like we're talking about the
[03:00:37.480 --> 03:00:42.600]  idea that if you build an exact replica of the brain that the consciousness would come and i said i
[03:00:42.600 --> 03:00:47.000]  believe that there's something more to that your response sure well a lot of transhumanists believe
[03:00:47.000 --> 03:00:51.880]  in mind uploading where you just upload your consciousness into machine and that's you and
[03:00:51.880 --> 03:00:56.280]  you know i think a lot of people ask well is that really you and this kind of gets into a great
[03:00:56.280 --> 03:01:01.480]  philosophical debate of materialism versus kind of spirituality a christian would say well you know
[03:01:01.480 --> 03:01:07.960]  after death or it's jesus or god that takes them to a new place and they have their their self and
[03:01:07.960 --> 03:01:11.720]  but you have to ask yourself well how does that actually happen well when scientists talk about
[03:01:11.720 --> 03:01:16.600]  mind uploading into machine they're talking about that same kind of philosophical jump except
[03:01:16.600 --> 03:01:22.120]  instead of into a spiritual world they're talking more into material world of data of bits and we've
[03:01:22.120 --> 03:01:28.120]  already had quite a bit of success actually in the last two years with telepathy um about 18 months
[03:01:28.120 --> 03:01:34.440]  ago between france and india they had mind reading headsets where people were able to say things to
[03:01:34.440 --> 03:01:39.880]  each other's minds without actually speaking out loud and and now they're doing all sorts of tests
[03:01:39.880 --> 03:01:43.320]  with this type of technology where you can think thoughts you read the brain waves through the
[03:01:43.320 --> 03:01:48.600]  eeg technology and then you can hear it in your you can hear someone saying these things to you
[03:01:48.600 --> 03:01:52.600]  but it's just telepathy this is how we're going to do mind uploading we're going to use those
[03:01:52.600 --> 03:01:58.200]  algorithms except much more complex you know a billion times over and put a human brain into a
[03:01:58.200 --> 03:02:06.360]  machine that can think and feel and hopefully act identically to and that's what concerns me as as
[03:02:06.360 --> 03:02:11.080]  Eric Schmidt said with google he said uh yeah we're going to get that technology just over the
[03:02:11.080 --> 03:02:15.640]  creepy line okay when we start reading people's minds to me the potential for abuse and of course
[03:02:15.640 --> 03:02:19.480]  this is something going back to history of DARPA this is something that they've been working on
[03:02:19.480 --> 03:02:25.880]  from the very inception of the agency to try to either physically do that or to try to infer that
[03:02:26.440 --> 03:02:31.160]  by watching everything that you do coming up with predictive algorithms to try to monitor
[03:02:31.160 --> 03:02:36.040]  and predict your behavior and then control your behavior because they're not they're not just curious
[03:02:36.040 --> 03:02:39.800]  that's about what you want to do they want to control that so that's one of the things that
[03:02:39.800 --> 03:02:45.720]  concerns me so much about all this technology is the vast potential for abuse and where much of
[03:02:45.720 --> 03:02:50.360]  this resources research is coming from and when that's why when young transhumanists ask me what
[03:02:50.360 --> 03:02:56.120]  field should I go into I always tell them security because security for the thing that you're worried
[03:02:56.120 --> 03:03:01.800]  about is perhaps going to be the biggest field of economy coming in the future we need to protect
[03:03:01.800 --> 03:03:06.440]  ourselves with this incredible technology we're going to have from abuse from government abuse
[03:03:06.440 --> 03:03:10.920]  from hackers abuse from individuals even abuse from people that may love us and can do things I mean
[03:03:10.920 --> 03:03:16.360]  now wives and husbands can what you know follow each other and we have the drones following us
[03:03:16.360 --> 03:03:21.640]  and stuff like that so this field of making sure that we retain our civil liberties in the area
[03:03:21.640 --> 03:03:26.440]  of 21st century technology is going to be the most important field going forward yeah yeah exactly and
[03:03:26.440 --> 03:03:32.280]  when we look at things like self-driving cars the potential for making us passive spectators you
[03:03:32.280 --> 03:03:37.560]  know controlled passive spectators in our own in our own environment as we were talking about this
[03:03:37.560 --> 03:03:44.200]  during the break I said you know transhumanism to me looks like traditional humanism atheistic
[03:03:44.200 --> 03:03:50.280]  secular you know materialistic it seems to me like it's kind of interesting we see transgenderism
[03:03:50.280 --> 03:03:54.440]  and all these other things it seems to me that many of these futurists like Ray Kurzweil really
[03:03:54.440 --> 03:03:59.080]  identify with being a machine more than they do with being a human right and so they're coming
[03:03:59.080 --> 03:04:05.400]  at this from this atheistic humanistic uh uh desiring to be a machine type of perspective
[03:04:05.400 --> 03:04:10.200]  your comment well I do want to point out that there's a growing field of religious transhumanists
[03:04:10.200 --> 03:04:16.040]  out there that are merging their spiritual ideas their biblical ideas with transhumanism and I
[03:04:16.040 --> 03:04:20.600]  think that is definitely going to be the future as you find a lot younger religious minded people
[03:04:20.600 --> 03:04:25.320]  saying you know I'm also open to technology but yeah right now it is a very materialistic and kind
[03:04:25.320 --> 03:04:31.640]  of secular minded movement and I think it makes it easier if you're a secularist to embrace this
[03:04:31.640 --> 03:04:37.400]  type of radical technology to go forward without a soul and to go forward as somebody who is just
[03:04:37.400 --> 03:04:42.120]  willing to be on their own in the universe yeah that's fundamentally the the difference in how
[03:04:42.120 --> 03:04:47.960]  we see the world Christians would see it as a medical physical a universe and uh cyclists
[03:04:47.960 --> 03:04:53.160]  would see it as strictly physical thank you so much for joining us Zoltan Isvan been an interesting
[03:04:53.160 --> 03:04:59.240]  discussion we'll be right back with the fourth hour Leanne McAdoo will be hosting Kid Daniels
[03:04:59.240 --> 03:05:04.680]  infoworse.com did you know that half of all americans make less than 30 000 a year new government
[03:05:04.680 --> 03:05:09.560]  data also reveals that 40 percent americans are making less than 20 000 annually which is well
[03:05:09.560 --> 03:05:14.280]  below the poverty level for family four and according to the daily caller this new data
[03:05:14.280 --> 03:05:18.600]  doesn't take into account the eight million americans who are unemployed or the tens of millions
[03:05:18.600 --> 03:05:23.640]  americans who gave up trying to find a job in fact we're now experiencing the lowest participation
[03:05:23.640 --> 03:05:29.160]  rate since 1977 this means that america's middle class is systematically being destroyed and this
[03:05:29.160 --> 03:05:34.760]  is intentional. Nikolo Machiavelli a 16th century pioneer on statescraft once said that it was in
[03:05:34.760 --> 03:05:38.920]  the government's best interest to keep its citizens poor but why well as the middle class
[03:05:38.920 --> 03:05:43.560]  disappears we're going to have a huge income gap in america between the ultra elite who hold most
[03:05:43.560 --> 03:05:48.120]  of the government power and the dirt poor who are too impoverished to stop the expansive government
[03:05:48.120 --> 03:05:52.200]  at the expense of their rights. Once again this is Kid Daniels with infoworse.com and

[03:08:23.640 --> 03:08:29.560]  in studio at about 230 we're going to take your calls talk about our experience with the liver
[03:08:29.560 --> 03:08:34.360]  shield cleanse a lot of people were very excited to so hear about our experience i will also be
[03:08:34.360 --> 03:08:40.120]  showing you some before and after photos mine is kind of a before and almost finished and
[03:08:40.120 --> 03:08:45.720]  i'll get into that a little bit later but first i wanted to talk about some of these articles
[03:08:45.720 --> 03:08:51.640]  that are up now this is from buzzfeed the world health organization has just decided that bacon
[03:08:51.640 --> 03:08:58.840]  and sausages do cause cancer after all now they are putting reclassifying processed meats into group
[03:08:58.840 --> 03:09:05.000]  one carcinogenic to humans that means there is sufficient evidence in humans that eating large
[03:09:05.000 --> 03:09:11.080]  quantities raises the risk of bowel cancer red meat has been classified as probably carcinogenic
[03:09:11.720 --> 03:09:15.560]  now they are saying you know that doesn't mean that you have to entirely stop eating meat this
[03:09:15.560 --> 03:09:22.840]  isn't the the big agenda 21 push to make you stop eating meat but they are saying that your your
[03:09:22.840 --> 03:09:28.840]  individual risk increases with the amount of meat that you consume here's another story that might
[03:09:28.840 --> 03:09:37.000]  gross you out your vegetarian hotdog meat might contain human dna so this is a food watchdog
[03:09:37.000 --> 03:09:43.960]  group a clear food they looked at 345 hotdog samples from 75 brands including meat-based
[03:09:43.960 --> 03:09:52.680]  and meat-free franks of those 345 hot dogs 14.4 percent had some sort of issue some dogs were
[03:09:52.680 --> 03:09:58.280]  labeled pork-free which is important of course if you know that's your religious uh criteria but
[03:09:58.280 --> 03:10:04.040]  they were found to contain pork after all and even grosser two percent of all samples were found to
[03:10:04.040 --> 03:10:10.600]  have traces of human dna in them veggie dogs were the worst off accounting for 67 percent of the
[03:10:10.600 --> 03:10:17.400]  hygiene issues and two-thirds of the human dna found so that's pretty gross thank goodness i cannot
[03:10:17.400 --> 03:10:22.200]  eat veggie hot dogs as a vegetarian it's too high of gluten for me it really hurts my stomach
[03:10:22.840 --> 03:10:27.400]  but i wanted to talk about those stories because like i mentioned in some of the videos that emi
[03:10:27.400 --> 03:10:31.480]  robin and i shot with this liver shield cleanse i have to say the most important product that we
[03:10:31.480 --> 03:10:36.360]  sell here that if you want to just purchase something if that's all you can afford go for the oxy
[03:10:36.360 --> 03:10:41.320]  powder you've got to cleanse that gut bacteria you've got to clean yourself out it's like
[03:10:42.520 --> 03:10:49.800]  key for optimal health is to have your gut bacteria in order and to honor our completion of the
[03:10:49.800 --> 03:10:55.400]  liver shield cleanse that were of course running a special right now the advanced liver cleanse pack
[03:10:55.400 --> 03:11:01.080]  is on sale liver shield is back in stock um obviously we keep selling out a liver shield
[03:11:01.080 --> 03:11:05.880]  with every run and for very good reason and now i can attest to that um i can speak on my own
[03:11:05.880 --> 03:11:11.720]  personal experience so try liver shield learn about how to perform this liver shield flush
[03:11:11.720 --> 03:11:17.800]  at infowarslife.com and again this is a limited run we're probably going to sell out of this again
[03:11:17.800 --> 03:11:25.080]  now joining me in studio is rob dew and we're going to talk about the assess pool of corruption
[03:11:25.080 --> 03:11:32.360]  within you know this vaccine cover-up so over the weekend us citizens marched on the cdc headquarters
[03:11:32.360 --> 03:11:38.280]  in atlanta to protest vaccine science corruption so what do you think is this finally are we
[03:11:38.280 --> 03:11:43.000]  pushing back against this ultimate push for mandatory vaccines right well it looks like
[03:11:43.000 --> 03:11:48.600]  right now the vaccine cover-up is imploding in congress and this is a cdc protest this was done
[03:11:48.600 --> 03:11:54.280]  in atlanta led by robert f kennedy jr who's been very outspoken against vaccines and which is great
[03:11:54.280 --> 03:11:58.920]  to see you know somebody like that and he's not necessarily a lot of the people are against these
[03:11:58.920 --> 03:12:03.240]  vaccine schedules and the ingredients and then they're not necessarily against vaccines you know
[03:12:03.240 --> 03:12:07.160]  at least they say but they're against them the way they're being done right now right so there's a
[03:12:07.160 --> 03:12:12.280]  big gathering um some of the doctors are some of the people that were speaking on there um
[03:12:12.280 --> 03:12:16.600]  they were going to have doctor uh congressman bill posi was going to be there who's been speaking
[03:12:16.600 --> 03:12:22.040]  out in congress and then here's an interesting person dr judy uh mikovitz she was the author of
[03:12:22.040 --> 03:12:27.800]  plague and a 20-year veteran researcher of the national cancer institute that she had her research
[03:12:27.800 --> 03:12:31.640]  destroyed for uncovering the hidden truths behind autism chronic fatigue syndrome human
[03:12:31.640 --> 03:12:37.560]  retroviruses and others so it's good to see you know people getting out protesting at the cdc
[03:12:37.560 --> 03:12:41.640]  because that's where a lot of that vaccine data comes from that pro vaccine data well they were
[03:12:41.640 --> 03:12:46.840]  also trying to say hey whatever happened to your senior scientist dr william tomson who
[03:12:46.840 --> 03:12:52.120]  publicly admitted i was going to get to dr tomson because here he's a guy he's another guy who's
[03:12:52.120 --> 03:12:58.680]  pro vaccine but he saw this cover-up happening where they skewed data with the m mr vaccine and
[03:12:58.680 --> 03:13:04.360]  showing uh basically that young african-american boys had a higher risk of getting autism after
[03:13:04.360 --> 03:13:09.480]  getting the m mr and they skewed that data by claiming these kids were adopted or they didn't
[03:13:09.480 --> 03:13:15.320]  have parents so they were they were uh changing the group the groupage that way so hey to make an
[03:13:15.320 --> 03:13:19.480]  omelet you gotta break some eggs yeah exactly but getting back to bill posi he actually went on the
[03:13:19.480 --> 03:13:24.040]  floor of congress and said we need to look at dr tomson's remarks we need to look at his research
[03:13:24.040 --> 03:13:28.920]  because there is a cover-up and it was you know publishing the information about the m mr which
[03:13:28.920 --> 03:13:33.960]  is measles mumps and rubella of course we had that big measles scare and i'm going to get to a little
[03:13:33.960 --> 03:13:39.480]  bit of that you know in a second but that's good that that dr tomson or that bill posi a representative
[03:13:39.480 --> 03:13:44.200]  from florida is speaking out against it and he said this considering the nature of the whistleblowers
[03:13:44.200 --> 03:13:48.520]  documents he's talking about dr tomson as well as the involvement of the cdc a hearing and a
[03:13:48.520 --> 03:13:53.080]  thorough investigation is warranted so i asked mr speaker i beg i implore my colleagues of the
[03:13:53.080 --> 03:13:58.200]  appropriations committee to please please take such an action posi said from the floor it is my
[03:13:58.200 --> 03:14:03.240]  duty that the documents dr tomson provided are not ignored posi said from the floor tuesday
[03:14:03.240 --> 03:14:08.440]  delivering nearly the same remarks in a speech several weeks ago so that pushback is starting
[03:14:08.440 --> 03:14:13.080]  to happen that and with other parents and people are going to start standing up with this sb277
[03:14:13.080 --> 03:14:17.640]  but there's another bill coming down the pike now here's a couple articles from forbes that i also
[03:14:17.640 --> 03:14:22.680]  wanted to get to and these are kind of you know vaccines skeptic hit pieces one they're talking
[03:14:22.680 --> 03:14:27.000]  about a former representative dan burton who used to get on the floor and talk about the
[03:14:27.000 --> 03:14:34.200]  the link between autism and vaccines and now he's being paid as a lobbyist which is not odd for a
[03:14:34.200 --> 03:14:39.320]  congressman to them become a lobbyist definitely for the other side of big pharma but the citizens
[03:14:39.320 --> 03:14:44.520]  commission on human rights now who is this this is a group funded by the scientologist so then they
[03:14:44.520 --> 03:14:49.080]  take that and and actually the citizens commission on human rights does have some valid points against
[03:14:49.080 --> 03:14:53.240]  over medication especially with mind-altering drugs they say there's way too much of them
[03:14:53.240 --> 03:14:56.520]  that's probably something we should look at because a lot of these people who are going on
[03:14:56.520 --> 03:15:01.880]  shooting people happen to be on these ssri's right so they are against that type of stuff and a lot
[03:15:01.880 --> 03:15:06.840]  of uh psychiatry they're very against that so he's with that group so they spend time attacking him
[03:15:06.840 --> 03:15:11.320]  and then they came out with one of his back to the future day last week on i guess friday or
[03:15:11.320 --> 03:15:16.920]  thursday it was you know marty mcfly went back to that date or went forward in that in time so they
[03:15:16.920 --> 03:15:22.680]  have this conversation between marty and doc and marty's talking about the flow the flu shot doc
[03:15:22.680 --> 03:15:27.800]  they're giving it out of pharmacy now and and the doctor oh yes pharmacies are vaccines are now
[03:15:27.800 --> 03:15:33.000]  easier to get and they just talk about how great it is now that the shot schedule has been increased
[03:15:33.000 --> 03:15:36.680]  you know because he only got eight shots and now there's 15 oh it's so great and oh and the and the
[03:15:36.680 --> 03:15:41.640]  doc is just saying science hadn't advanced far enough marty it's amazing what stride scientists
[03:15:41.640 --> 03:15:45.400]  have made so just these two articles from forbes i just you know people need to look out for this
[03:15:45.400 --> 03:15:50.520]  stuff because they're always putting out any type of pro vaccine propaganda they can just to get people
[03:15:50.520 --> 03:15:55.400]  in the door to get these things but here's some people need to look out for on a nationwide level
[03:15:55.400 --> 03:16:01.640]  not just sp277 which was the california legislation that eliminated the personal belief so you can't
[03:16:01.640 --> 03:16:05.720]  opt out of vaccines anymore if you want to put your kids in a public or private school they covered
[03:16:05.720 --> 03:16:11.000]  everything right now there's going to be hr6 which is called the 21st century cures act
[03:16:11.560 --> 03:16:17.960]  oh incidentally today today was the day back i think in 2003 or four uh george bush signed the
[03:16:17.960 --> 03:16:24.680]  patriot act oh i love so you know the very unpatriotic patriot act double speak anyway this is a 362
[03:16:24.680 --> 03:16:31.480]  page bill that mandates nine billion dollars be given to the national uh an institute for health
[03:16:31.480 --> 03:16:37.080]  to develop more drugs and vaccines and 550 million be given to the fd a fast track products to market
[03:16:37.080 --> 03:16:41.640]  was like our uh our transhumanist guest was saying today we need to get rid of the fda so
[03:16:41.640 --> 03:16:45.960]  we could get more drugs to market quicker but the you know the reason they have those loose
[03:16:45.960 --> 03:16:50.120]  regulations anyway that are that they pay off all the time you know there's always loopholes
[03:16:50.120 --> 03:16:54.840]  that these guys can go through is so that there is some checks and balance which i think we need
[03:16:54.840 --> 03:17:00.200]  it and we've never done placebo testing with vaccines we just look for antibodies so when they
[03:17:00.200 --> 03:17:04.920]  inject it into you they chest your blood and they go oh you've got antibodies now for the disease
[03:17:04.920 --> 03:17:10.920]  you're that means you're building an immunity but what it is is your body fighting back against
[03:17:10.920 --> 03:17:14.920]  adjuvants like aluminum and mercury being injected into your body and it's going wait a minute wait
[03:17:14.920 --> 03:17:18.920]  a minute right and your newborn baby and your newborn yeah they're actually pushing for mothers
[03:17:18.920 --> 03:17:23.000]  to you know just hold off on breastfeeding while we're giving you the vaccines you know your kids
[03:17:23.000 --> 03:17:27.080]  don't need that good mother's milk they need the vaccines well and some of the vaccines they're
[03:17:27.080 --> 03:17:32.520]  looking at to come out to come out with a one for hiv aids which i think will increase hiv aids rates
[03:17:32.520 --> 03:17:37.960]  in my personal opinion collidia chlamydia hepatitis c genital herpes syphilis gonorrhea
[03:17:37.960 --> 03:17:43.320]  ecoli norovirus tuberculosis a lot of these diseases are they're sexually transmitted
[03:17:43.320 --> 03:17:48.760]  diseases but they're also hygiene diseases you could say even you know you get to ecoli norovirus
[03:17:48.760 --> 03:17:53.640]  and tuberculosis a lot of those are from dirty areas and a lot of the we don't see a lot of
[03:17:53.640 --> 03:17:58.440]  these diseases except you're now seeing like a rise in gonorrhea syphilis and chlamydia in
[03:17:58.440 --> 03:18:04.760]  senior citizen populations wow well that's thanks to viagra and the tinder app i hear probably people
[03:18:04.760 --> 03:18:09.560]  are getting around well what what uh this this article that came out at the end of september
[03:18:09.560 --> 03:18:14.520]  by david adams who's a doctor he said be skeptical about vaccination claims and he makes some very
[03:18:14.520 --> 03:18:20.440]  interesting points one of which is from 1900 to 1965 measles deaths had already decreased 99
[03:18:20.440 --> 03:18:25.880]  percent 65 was when the vaccine was introduced and from 1900 to 35 pertussis deaths had already
[03:18:25.880 --> 03:18:31.320]  decreased 82 so these things were already on their way out when they told you we needed them that was
[03:18:31.320 --> 03:18:37.720]  from the union and then 30 of the measles cases from that disney land outbreak were from vaccinated
[03:18:37.720 --> 03:18:41.240]  kids though right you're not allowed to talk about what they don't say about i think that's
[03:18:41.240 --> 03:18:47.240]  racist of you to talk about facts of the 8200 pediatric pertussis cases reported in california
[03:18:47.240 --> 03:18:55.880]  2014 90 90 had been vaccinated right okay and they want to talk about herd immunity and you have to
[03:18:55.880 --> 03:19:00.760]  get these but and the cdc admits that over the last 10 plus years there have been no deaths from
[03:19:00.760 --> 03:19:07.800]  measles in the united states but 800 deaths eight i mean 108 deaths from the measles vaccine itself
[03:19:07.800 --> 03:19:13.080]  wow 2000 people disabled and isn't it funny how this country has such a love affair with the
[03:19:13.080 --> 03:19:17.960]  kennedy family except for one of them when one of them wants to actually speak out all right right
[03:19:17.960 --> 03:19:23.320]  as long as they're pulling the status quo or being used to justify closing down a park on the 50th
[03:19:23.320 --> 03:19:28.440]  anniversary of someone's death to you know inhibit free speech then it's okay yeah but they don't
[03:19:28.440 --> 03:19:32.600]  they don't like this at all and this is from dr david adams phd who lives in penn valley
[03:19:32.600 --> 03:19:37.400]  pennsylvania uh he also said childhood diseases seem to play a beneficial role in maturing the
[03:19:37.400 --> 03:19:41.720]  child's immune system a 2015 study found that those who had measles and mumps children suffered
[03:19:41.720 --> 03:19:47.080]  less heart attacks and less strokes later wow so your natural immune system is doing its job yeah
[03:19:47.080 --> 03:19:52.360]  imagine that yeah well vaccine skeptics could finally be taken seriously if congress will do its job
[03:19:52.360 --> 03:19:56.280]  now we'll be right back emi robin will be joining me in studio to take your phone calls

[03:24:26.360 --> 03:24:34.840]  liver shield cleanse the number to call is 1-800-259-9231 so we'll be taking your calls here in just
[03:24:34.840 --> 03:24:43.240]  a minute now in 2008 we had one of the worst financial crises happen here globally essentially
[03:24:43.240 --> 03:24:48.920]  us and the congress gave the american banks a 700 billion dollar tarp bailout at the expense of
[03:24:48.920 --> 03:24:54.760]  taxpayers no no bankers have even been charged with the crime in that relating to the collapse
[03:24:55.480 --> 03:25:01.080]  virtually no regulation of the banks and they're still pulling in record profits but that's pretty
[03:25:01.080 --> 03:25:07.000]  much the opposite of what iceland did and they've actually gone on and jailed even more bankers
[03:25:07.000 --> 03:25:11.960]  and these are not your low-level traders these are ceo's so we're going to go ahead and play a
[03:25:11.960 --> 03:25:17.720]  report now by john bound jail the bankers of course if we jail the bankers this whole house of cards
[03:25:17.720 --> 03:25:26.040]  would fall down 74 combined years in prison that's how iceland supreme court and the rakeovic district
[03:25:26.040 --> 03:25:33.240]  court respond to those responsible for iceland's financial collapse this brings the total to 26
[03:25:33.240 --> 03:25:39.800]  bankers now behind bars in iceland with most being ceo's of large financial institutions
[03:25:39.800 --> 03:25:46.040]  rather than low-level traders most of those jailed will serve terms of two to five years
[03:25:46.040 --> 03:25:52.280]  according to a report by iceland magazine which notes that three executives at lands bank and
[03:25:52.280 --> 03:25:58.280]  and two at calping along with one prominent investor have been prosecuted their crimes
[03:25:58.280 --> 03:26:03.880]  include market manipulation embezzlement and breach of fiduciary duties their market manipulation
[03:26:03.880 --> 03:26:09.080]  destroyed the country's economy and to this day iceland is still having to repay the global loan
[03:26:09.080 --> 03:26:15.240]  sharks at the imf as well as governments of other countries which kept the nation operating iceland
[03:26:15.240 --> 03:26:20.440]  magazine explains that rather than protect and reward the very institutions responsible for the
[03:26:20.440 --> 03:26:26.520]  collapse and the bloodsucking vermin that run them the icelandic government let them collapse
[03:26:26.520 --> 03:26:32.920]  and then created a financial supervisory authority to strictly oversee the banks iceland's president
[03:26:32.920 --> 03:26:38.760]  grimson noted why are the banks considered to be the holy churches of the modern economy why are
[03:26:38.760 --> 03:26:44.280]  private banks not like airlines and telecommunication companies and allowed to go bankrupt if they have
[03:26:44.280 --> 03:26:49.960]  been run in an irresponsible way the theory that you have to bail out banks is the theory that you
[03:26:49.960 --> 03:26:56.040]  allow bankers enjoy for their own profit their success and then let ordinary people bear their
[03:26:56.040 --> 03:27:01.000]  failure through taxes and austerity people in enlightened democracies are not going to accept
[03:27:01.000 --> 03:27:07.240]  that in the long run iceland's president grimson explained their strategy we were wise enough not
[03:27:07.240 --> 03:27:12.760]  to follow the traditional prevailing orthodoxies of the western financial world in the last 30 years
[03:27:12.760 --> 03:27:18.200]  we introduced currency controls we let the banks fail we provided support for the poor
[03:27:18.200 --> 03:27:23.240]  and we didn't introduce austerity measures like you're seeing in europe while the country's economy
[03:27:23.240 --> 03:27:28.840]  is far from what it once was it has stabilized and is in a position to recover meanwhile the
[03:27:28.840 --> 03:27:33.240]  governments of the u.s and europe bailed out most of those responsible for playing a direct
[03:27:33.240 --> 03:27:39.400]  role in the financial crisis that crippled the global economy make the first move in my show
[03:27:39.400 --> 03:27:44.760]  make the first move in get up get up off your butt stand up come on stand up
[03:27:52.840 --> 03:28:00.440]  the u.s congress gave american banks a 700 billion dollar tarp bailout at the expense of the taxpayers
[03:28:00.440 --> 03:28:05.400]  not one banker in the u.s has even been charged with a crime relating to the financial collapse
[03:28:05.400 --> 03:28:11.880]  there's still virtually no regulation of the banks and they are pulling in a near record 160
[03:28:11.880 --> 03:28:18.040]  billion in annual profits all for money created out of thin air the department of justice
[03:28:18.040 --> 03:28:23.240]  underholder and now lynch continues to pretend to do the hard work associated with reigning in
[03:28:23.240 --> 03:28:29.160]  financial criminal banking institutions laundering drug cartel money but fines and even penalties
[03:28:29.160 --> 03:28:35.160]  don't send the message that the banksters received in iceland jail the bankers the ones at the
[03:28:35.160 --> 03:28:42.360]  top and free the taxpayers it may be the most important meme the people of the united states
[03:28:42.360 --> 03:28:48.680]  could ever support jailing the bankers would bring the new world order down like a house of cards
[03:28:49.240 --> 03:28:55.720]  you have a large houseplant please marl let me get that for you oh yeah he's definitely won
[03:28:56.600 --> 03:29:01.640]  wow i gotta ask you this it's just a matter of national security i'm an important person now

[03:29:28.520 --> 03:29:33.720]  plead the fifth is also you know they're not gonna jail her either they said yeah you know they did
[03:29:33.720 --> 03:29:39.880]  some wrong doing there but bad behavior isn't a crime of course if it was our entire congress
[03:29:39.880 --> 03:29:44.600]  would be in prison so there you go all right well we'll be right back with emmy robin taking
[03:29:44.600 --> 03:29:50.920]  your phone calls on the liver shield cleanse we're on the march the empires on the run
[03:29:50.920 --> 03:29:57.800]  Alex jones and the gcn radio network
[03:29:58.600 --> 03:30:04.840]  kid daniels info wars dot com gun deaths are down 30 percent since 1993 that's right all gun deaths
[03:30:04.840 --> 03:30:09.720]  including murders suicides police shootings and accidental shootings have dropped nearly a third
[03:30:09.720 --> 03:30:15.400]  in between 1993 and 2000 the firearm murder rate dropped by almost half but guess what california
[03:30:15.400 --> 03:30:19.960]  which has some of these strictest gun laws in the country leads the nation in murders according to
[03:30:19.960 --> 03:30:24.280]  the washington examiner and generally speaking the most violent cities in the country have the most
[03:30:24.280 --> 03:30:28.360]  severe gun restrictions that isn't that surprising i mean if you're out committing violent crimes
[03:30:28.360 --> 03:30:32.520]  you really want your victim shooting back so isn't it ironic then that the mainstream media and the
[03:30:32.520 --> 03:30:36.760]  obama administration are currently pushing for more gun control president obama is even considering
[03:30:36.760 --> 03:30:41.800]  enacting gun control via executive order but not only is that illegal it's also dictatorial former
[03:30:41.800 --> 03:30:46.440]  house majority leader tom delay called that an impeachable offense in an interview with newsmax
[03:30:46.440 --> 03:30:50.200]  he said it's time for the house to start letting the people know that this is a lawless president
[03:30:50.200 --> 03:30:54.280]  and that's true an imperial president isn't just a threat to our second amendment rights but all

[03:34:36.600 --> 03:34:41.560]  not as hard as i thought that it was going to be and they are right now highlighting this
[03:34:41.560 --> 03:34:48.680]  dr groups six day liver cleanse instructions please follow the instructions i tried to sub
[03:34:48.680 --> 03:34:54.040]  them a little bit when we get to the salt flush so emmy we'll go ahead and start talking about
[03:34:54.040 --> 03:35:00.520]  that right now um so what i did is you're supposed to get epsom salts and we couldn't find it we were
[03:35:00.520 --> 03:35:05.400]  looking and the only thing they had was the epsom salt that you bathe in so it had lavender and honey
[03:35:05.400 --> 03:35:10.680]  and you know all of these ingredients and we're like i'm not going to ingest that confusing so
[03:35:10.680 --> 03:35:16.120]  we subbed it out with uh did you use himalayan sea salt as well i used uh Celtic sea salt well
[03:35:16.120 --> 03:35:22.280]  because when i do the the master cleanse which i i do quite a bit uh you flush every morning and i
[03:35:22.280 --> 03:35:27.320]  use Celtic sea salt with that but you drink it with a lot more water you do a lot more salt and a
[03:35:27.320 --> 03:35:32.280]  lot more water than what is recommended on dr groups instructions and i got to say dr group
[03:35:32.280 --> 03:35:36.040]  was pretty disappointed this morning when i talked to him and told him that i didn't follow his
[03:35:36.040 --> 03:35:42.600]  instructions and the reason why he uses the epsom salt specifically is because uh himalayan salt
[03:35:42.600 --> 03:35:47.960]  or Celtic sea salt or something like that that you could actually put on your food it's a different
[03:35:47.960 --> 03:35:53.480]  salt compound so it's got magnesium and things like that that your body will absorb because
[03:35:53.480 --> 03:35:57.800]  you know it's salt that you can eat whereas with the epsom salt it's a different kind of compound
[03:35:57.800 --> 03:36:03.640]  so even if you're just using that one tablespoon of epsom salt with eight ounces of water your body
[03:36:03.640 --> 03:36:09.080]  will flush it out it will react to it because it's like whoa this is not salt that i should be ingesting
[03:36:09.800 --> 03:36:15.800]  so i speak we didn't do our diary yesterday uh specifically because it was flush day and
[03:36:17.080 --> 03:36:23.880]  i got to say that was my least favorite part of this cleanse was doing the salt and three quarters
[03:36:23.880 --> 03:36:29.240]  of a cup of olive oil oh did you did you put a tiny bit of orange juice in it though i did your
[03:36:29.240 --> 03:36:34.280]  suggestion that does help it just a little bit tell us tell us what you told me how to do it
[03:36:34.280 --> 03:36:40.760]  because it did make it palatable i did it but it was horrendous um so i prefer doing the olive oil
[03:36:40.760 --> 03:36:46.280]  sipping it through a straw because i mean when you're trying to physically chug olive oil i mean
[03:36:46.280 --> 03:36:50.920]  it's it's a thicker scum and you also put in the refrigerator yeah i put it in the refrigerator
[03:36:50.920 --> 03:36:55.640]  in the morning because i knew that i was going to drink it that night um and then i just add like
[03:36:55.640 --> 03:37:00.280]  you know maybe a little less than a shot glass full of orange juice into it mix it and then
[03:37:00.280 --> 03:37:04.280]  i plug my nose even with the salt water flesh you need to plug your nose because it if you have
[03:37:04.280 --> 03:37:11.080]  any kind of gag reflex it will kick in i just kept saying i'm a mermaid i'm a mermaid so i plug
[03:37:11.080 --> 03:37:15.880]  my nose and just take a straw and sip it down you know and the second you let go of your nose
[03:37:15.880 --> 03:37:21.480]  you're going to taste the olive oil i mean olive oil isn't a pleasant taste at all but and i love
[03:37:21.480 --> 03:37:26.200]  olive oil but i don't want any but again that i mean group is right i mean that if you can keep
[03:37:26.200 --> 03:37:30.520]  it in for that eight hours and lay on your side for that 30 minutes it's gonna oil pull and it's
[03:37:30.520 --> 03:37:35.160]  gonna pull the toxins out of your liver and you do feel it did you not start to feel sick absolutely
[03:37:35.160 --> 03:37:39.320]  well as soon as i took the olive oil you're supposed to immediately go lay down on your right side
[03:37:39.320 --> 03:37:46.120]  pull your knees to your chest and i heard it it was like like little sort of popping sounds just
[03:37:46.120 --> 03:37:51.000]  starting to come out of wherever and i felt it flowing through my intestines but i also felt
[03:37:51.000 --> 03:37:58.520]  like i was on my deathbed because i was basically ODing on sodium and that is why my that is why
[03:37:58.520 --> 03:38:04.520]  my before and afters are not necessarily before and after i took so much salt that i woke up this
[03:38:04.520 --> 03:38:09.800]  morning and i was really bloated and needless to say i'm experiencing the flush today so now
[03:38:09.800 --> 03:38:15.480]  we're gonna go ahead and take some of your phone calls um i want to go ahead and talk to Chandler
[03:38:15.480 --> 03:38:24.120]  in oklahoma go ahead hello leanne nice to talk to you hi there can you can you hear me oh yeah
[03:38:24.120 --> 03:38:29.400]  you're live i i just had an aspect because nearly every caller asked that but anyways
[03:38:29.400 --> 03:38:36.920]  i'm 23 years old um i'm a construction worker uh i wrestled in high school i played basketball
[03:38:36.920 --> 03:38:44.200]  competitively and by no means am i out of shape or overweight but i found myself getting kind of
[03:38:44.200 --> 03:38:52.440]  fogged down midday praying in houses and i decided to deliver liver cleanse i did a liver cleanse
[03:38:52.440 --> 03:39:00.680]  and it just gave me uh i found myself taking energy drink having energy drinks midday and
[03:39:01.320 --> 03:39:07.400]  and uh not even bad any energy drinks um supplemental energy energy drinks but after the
[03:39:07.400 --> 03:39:16.200]  cleanse i absolutely did not have any fog fogginess during the day i was just i felt great after
[03:39:16.840 --> 03:39:24.360]  the cleanse and if if uh people if they have if they're a little overweight or if they have an
[03:39:24.360 --> 03:39:31.880]  inside job where they're not as active they're not doing i mean i just i feel like that's when
[03:39:31.880 --> 03:39:35.640]  it's absolutely going to get backed up there because you're not moving around and humans
[03:39:35.640 --> 03:39:39.720]  were not meant to be sitting around all day or meant to be getting a little bit of physical
[03:39:39.720 --> 03:39:43.800]  activity you're absolutely right about that what was your diet like before you did the cleanse
[03:39:45.160 --> 03:39:52.360]  my diet it my i i had a i had a good diet during throughout high school like i said i'm 23 so i
[03:39:52.360 --> 03:39:59.400]  kind of dropped out that diet and i wasn't eating i wasn't i i never drink pop i always drink water
[03:40:00.040 --> 03:40:05.480]  um i kind of watch what i eat throughout the week so i don't feel bad but did you find your
[03:40:05.480 --> 03:40:10.440]  self like not craving greasy stuff after the cleanse like you you were craving the healthy
[03:40:10.440 --> 03:40:15.800]  stuff afterwards because your body wants it oh yeah it gave me an extreme amount of uh
[03:40:16.440 --> 03:40:23.720]  mental motivation to continue eating healthy to not eat greasy food not eat drunk food gave me
[03:40:23.720 --> 03:40:30.440]  an extraordinary amount of motivation to keep up with eating right eating healthy right uh
[03:40:30.440 --> 03:40:35.400]  after the cleanse it was it was it was great it was amazing just bought some more i'm going to do a
[03:40:35.400 --> 03:40:42.280]  second cleanse because i'm her doctor group just stress how important it is to do it a second time
[03:40:42.280 --> 03:40:48.200]  and a third time and just keep up the yeah wow chandler well that that is so awesome to hear
[03:40:48.200 --> 03:40:52.600]  i'm glad that you had such tremendous results with this and that even after that salt flush
[03:40:52.600 --> 03:40:58.120]  and the olive oil experience you're ready to do it again uh thank you chandler because chandler's
[03:40:58.120 --> 03:41:04.120]  absolutely right i feel the exact same way it was so the way that i felt during the cleanse and even
[03:41:04.120 --> 03:41:11.640]  now today even after having been i think literally on my deathbed last night i feel great today i just
[03:41:11.640 --> 03:41:16.440]  you feel lighter literally our skin is glowing i didn't even want to put makeup on today just to
[03:41:16.440 --> 03:41:23.720]  let everyone see that my skin is just it's glowing it's clear the mental clarity and you know is
[03:41:23.720 --> 03:41:28.440]  that why you've done so many cleanses yeah i mean well i mean it all started like i said i started
[03:41:28.440 --> 03:41:33.000]  my very very first time i attempted to cleanse i started with one of the hardest ones which was
[03:41:33.000 --> 03:41:38.920]  the master obviously but uh this one i mean if if you if you are somebody out there and you are
[03:41:38.920 --> 03:41:44.600]  addicted to cleanses like i am you know i try to do them every four months so three times a year
[03:41:44.600 --> 03:41:49.720]  that's usually good i mean you you you build up a lot of the toxins from what what they put in our
[03:41:49.720 --> 03:41:55.000]  foods and whatnot so it's good to do it a couple of times a year um if you like cleanses this is
[03:41:55.880 --> 03:41:59.480]  i don't want to say it's easy to somebody who's never done one but it definitely is easy if you
[03:41:59.480 --> 03:42:06.520]  are a cleanser it's an easier cleanse to do yeah well this this has been my very first cleanse
[03:42:06.520 --> 03:42:11.720]  and good it was you know obviously it's really good to have someone along for the ride help keep
[03:42:11.720 --> 03:42:18.920]  you motivated keep your mental constitution in check you know don't give up so that was
[03:42:18.920 --> 03:42:24.200]  definitely very helpful and and it was it was an easy cleanse i think a lot of that what really
[03:42:24.200 --> 03:42:30.360]  helped is that i cut out cheese and wine my favorite things uh you know a few days beforehand
[03:42:30.360 --> 03:42:34.200]  and i think that that really helps to just kind of so you're not well except for i did eat that
[03:42:34.200 --> 03:42:38.360]  piece of pizza for lunch but also you know it helps the most on this cleanse is those oxy
[03:42:38.360 --> 03:42:43.720]  powder pills like i absolutely addicted i love the oxy powder pills because they will do what
[03:42:43.720 --> 03:42:49.240]  a saltwater flush does to you but they do it in a healthy way in a healthy way without that horrendous
[03:42:49.240 --> 03:42:54.040]  taste you're right i love the oxy powder pills so i mean and you don't want to obviously take
[03:42:54.040 --> 03:42:59.240]  those every day on a daily basis but like if i go out on the weekend and you know i'm going to a
[03:42:59.240 --> 03:43:04.040]  barbecue and i'm drinking beer and this and that and hey let's say i have an audition the next day
[03:43:04.040 --> 03:43:09.080]  i'm gonna take some oxy powder pills the night before and i'm gonna you know lose that bloating
[03:43:09.080 --> 03:43:14.840]  and sodium bloating and all that bad stuff well everyone is always worried about putting on those
[03:43:14.840 --> 03:43:19.480]  winter pounds with Thanksgiving and Christmas we're all worried about that and that's you're
[03:43:19.480 --> 03:43:24.760]  exactly right with oxy powder yeah you you kind of it's kind of a cheat thing but it is healthy
[03:43:24.760 --> 03:43:29.960]  it's healthy for you and you've got to cleanse the stuff out of your gut you know like i said here
[03:43:29.960 --> 03:43:36.520]  the world health organization is saying processed meats sausages and bacon uh causes cancer bowel
[03:43:36.520 --> 03:43:43.320]  cancer it's probably uh enough evidence they say it's probably carcinogenic and it's based on
[03:43:43.320 --> 03:43:48.680]  how much meat you're putting in your body and so many people eat tons of meat way more than is
[03:43:48.680 --> 03:43:56.040]  recommended so and what people don't understand is that that can stay in your intestines for years
[03:43:56.040 --> 03:44:01.480]  yeah red and pork especially you'll never cleanse it out and so that's why i recommend the oxy powder
[03:44:01.480 --> 03:44:05.320]  above everything if that's where you got to start but again we are running a special on it so
[03:44:05.320 --> 03:44:12.760]  now is the time to go ahead and try this liver cleanse pack uh because it is on sale um now
[03:44:13.400 --> 03:44:18.840]  we're going to go ahead and take some more calls i will let's talk to antwan in california go ahead
[03:44:20.840 --> 03:44:29.880]  hi can you hear me hey you're live yeah i took the liver cleanse uh i actually
[03:44:29.880 --> 03:44:38.280]  uh put it in some water and some uh olive oil and or olive oil or apple cider vinegar or whatever
[03:44:38.280 --> 03:44:46.520]  and um and i uh took it for about six or seven days i wanted to make sure that what was coming
[03:44:46.520 --> 03:44:53.160]  out was going to be really soft and so i took the olive oils oxy powder the absence salt was
[03:44:53.160 --> 03:44:58.920]  pretty easy to take and olive oil to me was pretty easy to take too and i didn't have like a gag reflex
[03:44:58.920 --> 03:45:06.120]  and um i thought i think about half of it came out because i felt a lot come out but it was pretty
[03:45:06.120 --> 03:45:13.240]  weird yeah it definitely feels weird thank you so antwan was it a success yeah it was a success
[03:45:14.040 --> 03:45:18.920]  yeah that's so awesome so thank you antwan and that's how what i gotta say i mean i feel
[03:45:19.640 --> 03:45:25.240]  today i mean i could say that yeah there are some globules and things it is real it's real
[03:45:25.240 --> 03:45:29.880]  everything that people are telling you it absolutely happens and it will encourage you
[03:45:29.880 --> 03:45:34.520]  to continue eating healthy at the very least i'm going to be introducing that apple cider vinegar
[03:45:34.520 --> 03:45:40.520]  mixture and the lemon water in my daily routine because your body needs it now i know a lot of
[03:45:40.520 --> 03:45:45.560]  people had questions on some of our videos they were asking i don't have a gallbladder can i still
[03:45:45.560 --> 03:45:50.600]  do this cleanse and i asked dr group about it and he said absolutely if you've already gotten your
[03:45:50.600 --> 03:45:55.320]  gallbladder removed it's probably better help your liver yes it's going to help your liver because
[03:45:55.320 --> 03:46:01.080]  now your liver is having to work overtime in order to cleanse and regardless of how you eat
[03:46:01.080 --> 03:46:05.800]  you're constantly going to get fluoride in the water tap water the air that's around us car
[03:46:06.520 --> 03:46:13.800]  the fumes from automobiles i mean so everybody needs to do this at least once a year i would say
[03:46:13.800 --> 03:46:25.480]  okay let's go to todd in florida hey todd yeah go ahead how are you i'm good thank you and i know
[03:46:25.480 --> 03:46:33.320]  you are hey i did this about eight months ago and it was quite by accident um what i did was
[03:46:35.560 --> 03:46:41.000]  beyond tangy tangerine i love that stuff and because i'm 54 years old um i have the body of
[03:46:41.000 --> 03:46:54.840]  a spartan if i do say so myself um i would do my uh mix up my beyond tangy tangerine with a quarter
[03:46:54.840 --> 03:47:08.840]  teaspoon of um inlay and salt and an ounce and a half of um the rags and um four teaspoons of
[03:47:08.840 --> 03:47:13.240]  sugar because i mean that stuff that makes just kind of hard to choke down in there was organic
[03:47:13.240 --> 03:47:22.680]  sugar by the way and all of a sudden i'm noticing i don't remember eating marbles yeah literally
[03:47:22.680 --> 03:47:33.400]  literally there were hundreds of these things that um i ejected and uh it was awesome now i put the
[03:47:33.400 --> 03:47:40.040]  i put the uh nation iodine in the mixture also nice and uh like i said i'm 54 years old i used
[03:47:40.040 --> 03:47:49.400]  to weigh 200 pounds i weigh 140 now and i feel fantastic yeah wow that's yeah well that's
[03:47:49.400 --> 03:47:53.880]  the liver cleanse well that is really good to hear todd i love hearing about so many people
[03:47:53.880 --> 03:47:59.320]  here educating themselves uh doing it the right way being healthy and taking care of yourself
[03:47:59.320 --> 03:48:04.840]  before you have to go to the doctor that's gonna want to do that extreme surgery so todd thank
[03:48:04.840 --> 03:48:09.240]  you so much that's really great to hear now uh if you want to see our before and after photos i
[03:48:09.240 --> 03:48:14.760]  think they said they've got them ready no like i said mine are before and almost after because
[03:48:14.760 --> 03:48:21.800]  i'm not done with my flush uh but you can see those if you go to info wars dot com forward slash
[03:48:21.800 --> 03:48:29.720]  show whoa any flat i was i promise you i promise you i was not sticking out in that first picture
[03:48:29.720 --> 03:48:35.000]  i just literally was relaxed and even in the second picture i was relaxed but like looking
[03:48:35.000 --> 03:48:40.040]  you can really it's crazy i can see my back in your side no i know i can see the muscles in my
[03:48:40.040 --> 03:48:45.560]  stomach it's nuts in my legs i feel like my legs look skinnier i don't know i i started off it like
[03:48:45.560 --> 03:48:52.520]  a i mean for my height i'm almost five nine so i started off at relatively healthy weight because
[03:48:52.520 --> 03:48:56.520]  i had done the liver cleanse in july and then i went straight into working and on a production
[03:48:56.520 --> 03:49:01.080]  for three months where i was working 18 hour days on my feet doing like eight miles a day so
[03:49:01.080 --> 03:49:04.440]  i mean i wasn't super out of shape but when i started that first liver cleanse i was
[03:49:04.440 --> 03:49:08.120]  pretty out of shape so that before yeah you said you're actually at the lowest weight of your
[03:49:08.840 --> 03:49:13.640]  well really much in a decade i guess yeah pretty much i'm almost back to where when i was a fitness
[03:49:13.640 --> 03:49:18.200]  model which would they have do they have mine before and all these factors are we gonna hold
[03:49:18.200 --> 03:49:24.760]  those off oh my goodness gracious moly look at you yeah i can see it in your arms where and your
[03:49:24.760 --> 03:49:29.880]  legs well where i really see it and where i really wanted it was in my side i guess you would call
[03:49:29.880 --> 03:49:35.400]  that the spare tire and you can actually see where there's that little roll oh my god this is so
[03:49:35.400 --> 03:49:40.840]  embarrassing there's that little roll kind of on the like the back fat and you can see it's it's
[03:49:40.840 --> 03:49:45.800]  on the way your chin look below your chin though oh my gosh you see you lose a little bit in your
[03:49:45.800 --> 03:49:50.120]  face too that's where i saw it big time the first time around there you go everyone before and
[03:49:50.120 --> 03:49:54.840]  afters and like i said mine is not even an after yet i should probably take more pictures later
[03:49:54.840 --> 03:50:01.400]  when all the sodium has left my body well i wanted to address something that um a lot of the skeptics
[03:50:01.400 --> 03:50:07.880]  on the cleanse um talk about the globules and not being just the oil coming out because the first
[03:50:07.880 --> 03:50:16.600]  time i did the cleanse i did the saltwater flush and globules came out like i'm talking good sized
[03:50:16.600 --> 03:50:21.320]  ones and the small sized ones and they were the neon green they looked exactly like the gallstones
[03:50:21.320 --> 03:50:26.280]  that group had you know and and googling pictures they look exactly like the gallstones and those
[03:50:26.280 --> 03:50:31.480]  came out before i even chugged the olive oil right and there you go and it's the liver shield
[03:50:31.480 --> 03:50:37.000]  that actually helps to soften up the gallbladder prepare you for that so those globules can start
[03:50:37.000 --> 03:50:41.240]  coming out and so there you go it was before you even took the olive oil there for all you
[03:50:41.240 --> 03:50:46.520]  naysayers uh but we also have some you know documentation that that is the case as well

[03:55:30.760 --> 03:55:36.520]  oh man jacari i don't know if i mean it's you like to fast pretty much every single month and i
[03:55:36.520 --> 03:55:41.000]  think you're you know obviously it's great physically but more so you're you are looking
[03:55:41.000 --> 03:55:48.520]  into that spiritual aspect of it as well right which now i totally get it yeah i fast um probably
[03:55:48.520 --> 03:55:53.880]  you know i try to do a couple days a month i ideally once a week ideally being the keyword
[03:55:53.880 --> 03:56:00.360]  and i usually just go you know 24 hours whatever just drinking juice or water and over this past
[03:56:00.360 --> 03:56:05.240]  weekend i did do two days but then we went out with uh joe one of our camera guys and i ate a
[03:56:05.240 --> 03:56:10.120]  lot of stuff on his birthday so yeah i probably gained all that weight right back but i avoided
[03:56:10.120 --> 03:56:15.320]  that get together yeah wow it's a good time all all in attendance had a great time but you know
[03:56:15.320 --> 03:56:19.400]  as you were alluding to it's not just for the physical aspects but as a spiritual as well and
[03:56:20.120 --> 03:56:23.800]  it took me some getting used to because i used to eat a lot i still do eat a lot but
[03:56:23.800 --> 03:56:27.720]  you know coming from high school you know we worked out twice a day and all this stuff i kind
[03:56:27.720 --> 03:56:32.360]  of kept that mentality so to go just two days without food was really hard in the beginning
[03:56:32.360 --> 03:56:36.920]  but you get used to it as time goes on yeah i know you absolutely do and i i get it now because
