[00:00.000 --> 00:11.520]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.520 --> 00:19.080]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.080 --> 00:37.440]  Texas Alex Jones coming up in the fourth hour today this live Friday edition the
[00:37.440 --> 00:44.040]  21st day of August we have Dr. Marcus Siegel Fox News contributor he is
[00:44.040 --> 00:48.160]  resigned from the American Medical Association saying that the Obama
[00:48.160 --> 00:55.120]  Healthcare Plan is a eugenics plan and that's what it is sure free health care
[00:55.120 --> 01:00.400]  being administered by angels would be fine but it's not free they're gonna
[01:00.400 --> 01:05.040]  take another piece of your paycheck out anybody who's gone on unemployment
[01:05.040 --> 01:10.240]  anybody that's experienced that your employer and you end up paying in to
[01:10.240 --> 01:14.440]  your unemployment insurance even if it doesn't say it on your check the
[01:14.440 --> 01:18.040]  employer is paying you less because they have to pay that money in and then
[01:18.040 --> 01:22.840]  when you try to go declare unemployment it's very hard to ever even stay on it
[01:22.840 --> 01:29.360]  a month or two is what I've read and been told one time I was unemployed in
[01:29.360 --> 01:32.080]  college for a few months and they said well go declare unemployment while you're
[01:32.080 --> 01:37.120]  looking for a better job and I started the process and it was so tiresome and
[01:37.120 --> 01:41.000]  ridiculous and talking to bureaucrats over the telephone I just said well I'll
[01:41.000 --> 01:48.440]  just go out and you know I guess take a really crummy job if I have to but
[01:48.440 --> 01:52.800]  side issue the point here is we're gonna be talking about that the eugenics
[01:52.800 --> 01:56.960]  healthcare operation with Dr. Mark Siegel coming up in the last hour today we
[01:56.960 --> 02:00.480]  always have our visit of course in the third hour with Bob Chapman of the
[02:00.480 --> 02:06.080]  international forecaster and coming up in the next hour 58 minutes from now
[02:06.080 --> 02:11.440]  Florida Obama activist Obama Joker poster activist the teenager who is a
[02:11.440 --> 02:17.720]  listener of this show who went out and put them up on telephone polls said the
[02:17.720 --> 02:24.920]  police saw him over and over again doing it and came over to him and asked
[02:24.920 --> 02:29.320]  him what he was doing and then said fine with us everybody else does it see
[02:29.320 --> 02:35.840]  police understand that rule-and-law that you can't selectively enforce and so
[02:35.840 --> 02:41.200]  that's good the media has been hoaxing and acting like the police were upset
[02:41.200 --> 02:45.680]  with this and that's why you see the police on the news now saying well we
[02:45.680 --> 02:48.400]  don't know this is a bad thing or not we don't know if it's a first amendment
[02:48.400 --> 02:52.560]  or not the ACLU piled on and said oh no arrest him immediately because it's
[02:52.560 --> 02:56.400]  Obama being criticized and you know off with his head and the state attorney
[02:56.400 --> 03:00.800]  generals offices who looking at it but other people are putting the posters out
[03:00.800 --> 03:06.680]  in Florida and the youth says that he was not even really detained or taken
[03:06.680 --> 03:13.760]  away by the police that the media is a total distortion so we've got to think
[03:13.760 --> 03:20.480]  of his pseudonym the poster man whenever we want to call him coming up in the
[03:20.480 --> 03:25.880]  next hour because this is bigger than just a discussion about putting Obama
[03:25.880 --> 03:29.280]  Joker posters up it's the fact that they're saying on the news and I found
[03:29.280 --> 03:36.160]  three more mainstream news stories yesterday saying it's a hate crime it's
[03:36.160 --> 03:42.000]  criminal it's racist news articles newspapers are actually saying this is a
[03:42.000 --> 03:47.800]  racial activity and see that's why I've tried to never get into racial issues
[03:47.800 --> 03:51.840]  because no matter what you believe about all these racial issues the
[03:51.840 --> 03:57.080]  establishment loves it and plays off of it and loves to balkanize and control
[03:57.080 --> 04:01.640]  people and they love to radicalize groups to the point of where no one can
[04:01.640 --> 04:07.120]  work together against the overall new world order banking system and so that's
[04:07.120 --> 04:12.800]  why I try to work with everybody I try you know I at a primitive level get
[04:12.800 --> 04:15.720]  threatened by the police and things they do and end up yelling and screaming and
[04:15.720 --> 04:21.120]  flipping out over police which has been wrong bad police I should flip out about
[04:21.120 --> 04:26.920]  but just the overall attacking police then feeds into the psychology of police
[04:26.920 --> 04:30.880]  feeling like they're under attack so they compact more into their gang
[04:30.880 --> 04:37.480]  mentality you know we all learn as we go along
[04:38.640 --> 04:43.160]  and so we're gonna break all this news down and a lot more coming up after this
[04:43.160 --> 04:47.000]  quick break got more news on the swine flu jabs for babies and children in

[07:07.640 --> 07:10.720]  you know here's the story the current administration is committed to
[07:10.720 --> 07:14.440]  nationalizing health care giving 40 million new people free care now here's
[07:14.440 --> 07:17.760]  the bad news the current system will almost be immediately overwhelmed by
[07:17.760 --> 07:21.520]  these new demands for free services and procedures Medicare and Medicaid are
[07:21.520 --> 07:25.120]  already bankrupt many doctors are now leaving their practices frightened by
[07:25.120 --> 07:29.080]  the prospect of forced procedures all this is creating a perfect storm which
[07:29.080 --> 07:33.280]  could create unimaginable shortages in the health care services folks it's time
[07:33.280 --> 07:36.640]  to be prepared for the worst our friends at solutions from science have

[08:00.360 --> 08:20.160]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:20.160 --> 08:28.080]  we've got an article up on info wars dot com right now written by dr. Paul
[08:28.080 --> 08:38.040]  Craig Roberts titled Americans surfs ruled by oligarchs and that is exactly
[08:38.040 --> 08:42.800]  what the article breaks down and there's a video that curtain emo posted in the
[08:42.800 --> 08:49.600]  article by John Pillager who is a excellent documentary filmmaker in
[08:49.600 --> 08:56.400]  England and he kind of comes from the liberal or socialist perspective and
[08:56.400 --> 09:05.800]  other than him basically calling for single-payer health care I agree with
[09:05.800 --> 09:10.640]  everything that said in this video clip I mean it said so well the way he
[09:10.640 --> 09:16.040]  concisely says it in five minutes is just amazing so I want to play that
[09:16.040 --> 09:20.720]  clip in a moment and then we'll get into all the other important news that I have
[09:20.720 --> 09:26.360]  here in front of me today on a host of issues but the problem is if you attack
[09:26.360 --> 09:33.720]  Obama in the wrong way or from the wrong angle the political experts that groomed
[09:33.720 --> 09:39.520]  him and that set up his corporate plastic fake teleprompter image have
[09:39.520 --> 09:45.560]  designed it to where it actually empowers him because then they can invoke
[09:45.560 --> 09:51.880]  the race card and then expand political correctness expand an attack on free
[09:51.880 --> 10:00.040]  speech in the first amendment so when Webster Tarpoli says the way to attack
[10:00.040 --> 10:05.640]  Obama is from the left he is right but you've got to preface that with the fact
[10:05.640 --> 10:09.160]  that the entire left paradigm is controlled the entire right paradigm
[10:09.160 --> 10:15.440]  is controlled and we talk about the left-right paradigm here we do that so
[10:15.440 --> 10:18.720]  that people get outside the box and see the bigger picture but we still have to
[10:18.720 --> 10:24.120]  then go in in the public debate and use the term left and right to be able to
[10:24.120 --> 10:27.760]  communicate with the general public who aren't aware of the left-right paradigm
[10:27.760 --> 10:35.120]  I am the person more than 12 years ago who coined and introduced the term the
[10:35.120 --> 10:41.520]  left-right paradigm and how they use the controlled left-right system to kind
[10:41.520 --> 10:48.480]  of in the WWF pro wrestling system play two different sides of a controlled
[10:48.480 --> 10:55.520]  opposition off against each other you know two wings on the same bird others
[10:55.520 --> 11:00.600]  had voiced these ideas previous to me I had just really coined and hammered the
[11:00.600 --> 11:04.160]  term left-right paradigm that's why it's kind of funny when I'm on other radio
[11:04.160 --> 11:08.840]  talk shows or people send me emails or I see comments on the stories that are
[11:08.840 --> 11:14.240]  posted info wars.com or prisonplanet.com we'll post something from Cindy
[11:14.240 --> 11:19.600]  Sheehan an article she's written and it'll have something about the left and
[11:19.600 --> 11:23.000]  right though she's getting away from that and they'll say oh look Alex has a
[11:23.000 --> 11:26.920]  leftist I thought you're against the left-right paradigm Alex or I'll post
[11:26.920 --> 11:31.440]  something from a Republican or a speech from a Republican or a Ronald Reagan
[11:31.440 --> 11:34.560]  speech on socialized medicine they'll say Alex I thought she weren't in the
[11:34.560 --> 11:40.280]  left-right paradigm and so it's kind of funny to have people using my own term
[11:40.280 --> 11:46.520]  at me explaining to me how it works yes I understand how it works but that I
[11:46.520 --> 11:50.400]  mean if I post an associated press article where they're demonizing
[11:50.400 --> 11:54.560]  militias and conservatives and gun owners that doesn't mean I agree with
[11:54.560 --> 11:59.720]  the associated press article that is attacking me by name obviously I'm not
[11:59.720 --> 12:06.800]  agreeing with it sometimes I wonder it's like people can't differentiate not
[12:06.800 --> 12:16.000]  just subtleties but very serious blaring obvious points that we're making
[12:16.000 --> 12:19.880]  somehow get distorted and sometimes I know that's on purpose sometimes I know
[12:19.880 --> 12:26.120]  it's just people are ignorant but but it's it's very very frustrating and it's
[12:26.120 --> 12:29.800]  frustrating to get all these emails and comments and and phone calls saying you
[12:29.800 --> 12:36.480]  support John McCain you support the Republicans you're paid by Bush you're
[12:36.480 --> 12:40.520]  paid by the insurance companies when I know the big insurance companies it
[12:40.520 --> 12:45.480]  comes out our funding this form of health care that Obama's supporting it's
[12:45.480 --> 12:51.160]  where they're given liability protection the big mega HMOs are given
[12:51.160 --> 12:54.320]  liability they're giving liability on the drugs and vaccines they give you I
[12:54.320 --> 13:00.960]  mean this isn't really socialism but I mean I they they socialize our wealth
[13:00.960 --> 13:06.360]  but they privatize the profit off of that socialized system and so that's the
[13:06.360 --> 13:09.680]  problem is like George Arwell talked about this in 1984 and talked about it
[13:09.680 --> 13:13.640]  in essay letters he wrote about the book how in reality he believed this was
[13:13.640 --> 13:16.400]  already happening where they were destroying words changing their
[13:16.400 --> 13:22.040]  semantical meanings until it's hard to even communicate and this is the science
[13:22.040 --> 13:27.160]  of what the establishment has created and pushed so so so right now let's play
[13:27.160 --> 13:40.320]  this clip from the filmmaker this Australian filmmaker really breaking
[13:40.320 --> 13:49.280]  down how this system really works John Pilger Obama is a corporate marketing
[13:49.280 --> 13:54.800]  creation it's up on info wars.com posted inside of Paul Craig Robert story
[13:54.800 --> 14:00.680]  Americans serves rule by oligarchs here it is the clever young man who recently
[14:00.680 --> 14:06.560]  made it to the White House is a very fine hypnotist partly because it is
[14:06.560 --> 14:11.400]  indeed extraordinary to see an African American at the pinnacle of power in the
[14:11.400 --> 14:18.880]  land of slavery however this is the 21st century and race together with gender
[14:18.880 --> 14:25.400]  and even class can be very seductive tools of propaganda for what is so often
[14:25.400 --> 14:32.920]  overlooked and what matters I believe above all is the class one serves George
[14:32.920 --> 14:37.320]  Bush is in a circle from the State Department to the Supreme Court was
[14:37.320 --> 14:42.880]  perhaps the most multiracial in presidential history it was PC power
[14:42.880 --> 14:48.800]  excellence think Condoleezza writes Colin Powell it was also the most
[14:48.800 --> 14:55.240]  reactionary Obama's very presence in the White House appears to reaffirm the
[14:55.240 --> 15:02.640]  moral nation he's a marketing dream but like Calvin Klein or Benetton is a brand
[15:02.640 --> 15:08.360]  that promises something special something exciting almost risque as if he
[15:08.360 --> 15:15.600]  might be radical as if he might enact change he makes people feel good he's a
[15:15.600 --> 15:22.680]  postmodern man with no political baggage and all that's fake in his book
[15:22.680 --> 15:27.680]  dreams from my father Obama refers to the job he took after he graduated from
[15:27.680 --> 15:33.800]  Columbia in 1983 he describes his employer as an I quote a consulting
[15:33.800 --> 15:39.720]  house to multinational corporations unquote for some reason he doesn't say
[15:39.720 --> 15:44.920]  who his employer was or what he did there the employer was business
[15:44.920 --> 15:49.640]  international corporation which has a long history of providing cover for the
[15:49.640 --> 15:55.920]  CIA with covert action and infiltrating unions on the left I know this because it
[15:55.920 --> 16:01.880]  was especially active in my own country Australia Obama doesn't say what he did
[16:01.880 --> 16:08.000]  at business international and they may be absolutely nothing sinister but it
[16:08.000 --> 16:16.240]  seems worthy of inquiry and debate has a clue to perhaps who the man is during
[16:16.240 --> 16:21.000]  his brief period in the Senate Obama voted to continue the wars in Iraq and
[16:21.000 --> 16:26.800]  Afghanistan he voted for the Patriot Act he refused to support a bill for
[16:26.800 --> 16:32.160]  single-payer health care he supported the death penalty as a presidential
[16:32.160 --> 16:37.840]  candidate he received more corporate backing than John McCain he promised to
[16:37.840 --> 16:43.440]  close Guantanamo as a priority but instead his excused torture reinstated
[16:43.440 --> 16:49.840]  military commissions kept the Bush Gulag intact and opposed habeas corpus
[16:49.840 --> 16:57.320]  Daniel Ellsberg the great risk whistleblower was right I believe when he
[16:57.320 --> 17:02.960]  said that under Bush a military coup had taken place in the United States giving
[17:02.960 --> 17:08.800]  the Pentagon unprecedented powers these powers have been reinforced by the
[17:08.800 --> 17:14.880]  presence of Robert Gates a bush family crony and George W. Bush's powerful
[17:14.880 --> 17:20.880]  secretary of defense and by all the bush Pentagon officials and generals who
[17:20.880 --> 17:26.840]  have kept their jobs under Obama in the middle of a recession with millions of
[17:26.840 --> 17:32.000]  Americans losing their jobs and homes Obama has increased the military budget
[17:32.000 --> 17:38.200]  in Colombia he is planning to spend 46 million dollars on a new military base
[17:38.200 --> 17:45.000]  that will support a regime backed by death squads and further the tragic history
[17:45.000 --> 17:52.040]  of Washington's intervention in that region in a pseudo event in Prague
[17:52.040 --> 17:57.560]  Obama promised a world without nuclear weapons to a global audience mostly
[17:57.560 --> 18:02.400]  unaware that America is building new tactical nuclear weapons designed to
[18:02.400 --> 18:08.960]  blur the distinction between nuclear and conventional war like George Bush he
[18:08.960 --> 18:14.000]  used the absurdity of Europe threatened by Iran to justify building a missile
[18:14.000 --> 18:20.040]  system aimed at Russia and China in another pseudo event at the Annapolis
[18:20.040 --> 18:25.680]  Naval Academy decked with flags and uniforms Obama lied that America had
[18:25.680 --> 18:30.600]  gone to Iraq to bring freedom to that country he announced that the troops
[18:30.600 --> 18:36.680]  were coming home this was another deception the head of the army general
[18:36.680 --> 18:42.240]  George Casey says with some authority that America will be in Iraq for up to a
[18:42.240 --> 18:50.400]  decade other generals say 15 years Chris Hedges the very fine author of
[18:50.400 --> 18:58.720]  Empire of Illusion puts it very well President Obama he wrote does one thing
[18:58.720 --> 19:04.840]  and brand Obama get you to believe another this is the essence of successful

[19:10.600 --> 19:19.000]  you feel I'm quote and so you are kept in a perpetual state of childishness he
[19:19.000 --> 19:23.760]  calls this junk politics
[19:23.760 --> 19:30.240]  okay junk politics and that's what it is and that's what the establishment does
[19:30.240 --> 19:34.440]  so Obama's there to suppress the left but continue to carry out all the exact
[19:34.440 --> 19:39.840]  same policies of Bush and actually expand them so that's why I've told a lot
[19:39.840 --> 19:44.240]  of Republicans if you supported George Bush you should love Barack Obama but
[19:44.240 --> 19:50.720]  see his rhetoric's different so you hate him but the left loves him when the
[19:50.720 --> 19:56.720]  phony right wing should be on their knees before Barack Obama we'll be right

[22:24.040 --> 22:28.200]  demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is
[22:28.200 --> 22:33.440]  imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs
[22:33.440 --> 22:39.960]  that's fascism it's not about left to right it's about a one-world government

[24:23.840 --> 24:28.640]  much is happening I told Watson to tell the other writers Kurt Nemo Steve
[24:28.640 --> 24:33.160]  Watson and others Aaron Dykes we need to have them start doing alerts every week
[24:33.160 --> 24:38.560]  I mean there's enough issues happening where I'm seeing four or five things that
[24:38.560 --> 24:45.680]  warrant an info wars or prison planet alert every day so we need to start
[24:45.680 --> 24:53.200]  really highlighting stories that are of in particularly important nature so we
[24:53.200 --> 24:58.560]  don't just serve to kind of in give people information fatigue where we
[24:58.560 --> 25:04.320]  release these giant important stories and then don't even hype them up
[25:04.320 --> 25:09.840]  ourselves because it deserves to be hyped it deserves to get people
[25:09.840 --> 25:18.000]  hyperventilating that hundreds of European and Asian newspapers and
[25:18.000 --> 25:25.720]  German newspapers are reporting that the current swine flu injection that they
[25:25.720 --> 25:29.960]  are planning to force the people to take in the United States in Europe from
[25:29.960 --> 25:35.240]  Greece to Canada from the United States to Mexico all over the world they're
[25:35.240 --> 25:39.880]  manufacturing four plus billion injections of this the news is reporting
[25:39.880 --> 25:46.120]  and they're planning to forcibly inject people and the big news is they are
[25:46.120 --> 25:52.880]  testing it on babies toddlers pregnant women and school children this is USA
[25:52.880 --> 25:58.440]  today Associated Press Chicago Tribune I mean I've got stacks of it it's I know
[25:58.440 --> 26:05.040]  you've seen it it's all over the news the point is that it's happening and the
[26:05.040 --> 26:16.240]  alert is we know we know I mean here's the age out of Australia infectious
[26:16.240 --> 26:19.920]  disease risk and swine flu jabs leading infectious disease experts have
[26:19.920 --> 26:22.920]  called the federal government to abandon its mass swine flu vaccination plan
[26:22.920 --> 26:26.600]  because of fears the vaccine is contaminated and that could spread
[26:26.600 --> 26:31.320]  blood-borne diseases health minister Nicola Roxton yesterday announced the
[26:31.320 --> 26:34.440]  government would start developing its first batch of swine flu vaccine in
[26:34.440 --> 26:37.920]  coming weeks with an aim to vaccinate as many people as possible to prevent
[26:37.920 --> 26:41.880]  further spread of the virus but in a letter sent to the Commonwealth Chief
[26:41.880 --> 26:46.000]  Medical Officer Jim Bishop the Australian Society for Infectious
[26:46.000 --> 26:52.000]  Diseases expressed deep concern about CSL's use of multi-dose vials for the
[26:52.000 --> 26:56.760]  vaccine urged the government to abandon its plan until it had single-dose vials
[26:56.760 --> 27:00.880]  in a letter written by the Society's president associate professor Tom Gottlieb
[27:00.880 --> 27:05.760]  says multi-dose vials bottles containing many doses of the vaccine had been
[27:05.760 --> 27:09.120]  shown on many occasions to transmit infectious diseases resulting in
[27:09.120 --> 27:14.320]  considerable morbidity and mortality that means killing people you understand
[27:14.320 --> 27:18.400]  what that means morbidity and mortality that guys print me the definition for
[27:18.400 --> 27:22.880]  morbidity and mortality I want the exact definition people won't believe it it
[27:22.880 --> 27:29.520]  means killing you understand to prevent contamination clinicians must follow
[27:29.520 --> 27:32.560]  stringent infections control so the way they're going to give it is bad now
[27:32.560 --> 27:38.240]  here's build biggest newspaper in Germany virus increased the risk of cancer
[27:38.240 --> 27:43.800]  and it goes in to say that it has all sorts of cancer viruses other things in
[27:43.800 --> 27:51.960]  it here is a another one mail online Sunday mail swine flu jab link to killer
[27:51.960 --> 27:56.960]  nerve disease leaked letter reveals concern of neurologist over 25 deaths
[27:56.960 --> 28:03.240]  in America just in the initial test this is a week old and basically tells
[28:03.240 --> 28:09.280]  him how to cover it up now here's AP polio surgeon Nigeria at your vaccine
[28:09.280 --> 28:13.800]  virus mutates says it's killing and maiming people because it's live polio
[28:13.800 --> 28:17.600]  and it's mutating now I have other news in my stack where they admit that the
[28:17.600 --> 28:27.680]  multiple three jab causes mutations that it causes mutations to take three to four
[28:27.680 --> 28:35.680]  shots now I was on man Cal Muller's radio show syndicated in several hundred
[28:35.680 --> 28:42.240]  markets this morning for off and on for an hour I say off and on you sit there
[28:42.240 --> 28:51.800]  and they have the star of what's that new movie I had the name of my mind and
[28:51.800 --> 28:56.400]  then I just lost it district 19 or whatever it is and then you know you're
[28:56.400 --> 28:58.880]  going for five minutes and another guest comes on you go on for five minutes
[28:58.880 --> 29:02.200]  but I don't mind sometimes I'm on there like William Shatner's on there I got
[29:02.200 --> 29:04.400]  to sit there and hold listen to William Shatner for five minutes and then
[29:04.400 --> 29:09.120]  somebody else is on there he has a lot of a guest point is I'm on there off and
[29:09.120 --> 29:14.360]  on for an hour and they would bring on this Fox News person this Fox News
[29:14.360 --> 29:17.600]  producer should have written his name down I didn't and he would come on and
[29:17.600 --> 29:21.960]  scream at me and tell me I was a liar about the flu shot killing people and I
[29:21.960 --> 29:26.040]  would give him the headlines and he would still laugh at me it's like it's
[29:26.040 --> 29:30.520]  funny because there's this has not been in any US newspapers that I know I've
[29:30.520 --> 29:35.880]  been looking for him nowhere on our news that in the trials here in the US it's
[29:35.880 --> 29:40.120]  killing a large percentage of people and killing people in Europe in the trials
[29:40.120 --> 29:46.360]  now we need to force this out the head of Health Human Services needed to be

[33:24.640 --> 33:29.760]  so the age newspaper out of Australia one of the biggest newspapers and most
[33:29.760 --> 33:35.400]  respected over there is reporting that there is an infectious disease risk in
[33:35.400 --> 33:41.640]  the swine flu jabs you can also search engine the term that the three shots for
[33:41.640 --> 33:49.200]  the flu is guaranteed to create massive mutations that the different variants of
[33:49.200 --> 33:54.040]  the swine flu once they're put into the human body it's a perfect way to mutate
[33:54.040 --> 34:00.120]  them randomly thousands of different ways to create a super flu that was the
[34:00.120 --> 34:04.360]  same thing that came out in Europe a few months ago before all this really got
[34:04.360 --> 34:09.120]  going was all these homeless people dying I mean in one case they gave it to
[34:09.120 --> 34:18.480]  115 homeless people 23 died within two days died of bird flu of weaponized
[34:18.480 --> 34:22.440]  bird flu and the governments are secretive about what pharma company
[34:22.440 --> 34:26.240]  paid local officials to do it but the local officials have been arrested and
[34:26.240 --> 34:31.080]  are going to prison for murder but it says they were secretly paid by a pharma
[34:31.080 --> 34:35.360]  company to do it then separately we have Baxter we don't know that's the company
[34:35.360 --> 34:38.360]  our experts believe it's not they believe it's one of the other bigger
[34:38.360 --> 34:47.400]  companies over there mixing with the larger flu virus samples that they were
[34:47.400 --> 34:57.840]  producing in their research they mixed live bird flu live bird flu weaponized
[34:57.840 --> 35:04.280]  bird flu with the vaccine stock but then a company in Czechoslovakia did the
[35:04.280 --> 35:07.600]  testing they were supposed to and tested it on ferrets if the ferret gets
[35:07.600 --> 35:11.720]  sick you know because ferrets are similar to humans when it comes to flu
[35:11.720 --> 35:16.040]  then you know that they haven't attenuated or killed the virus properly
[35:16.040 --> 35:21.760]  that you've got a live virus it didn't just make them sick which you throw the
[35:21.760 --> 35:27.320]  shots away if they get sick it killed them and they said what is this and they
[35:27.320 --> 35:32.400]  looked and it was live bird flu and it was about to be shipped out and put in
[35:32.400 --> 35:37.200]  vaccine but that stopped it by the grace of God now probably somebody inside the
[35:37.200 --> 35:41.280]  vaccine company blew the whistle somebody inside who knew I mean you don't
[35:41.280 --> 35:48.080]  just think they randomly happened to catch it no because they just
[35:48.080 --> 35:51.720]  accidentally happened to ship out the bird flu and mislabel it in an
[35:51.720 --> 36:01.080]  accidentally at 14 labs and 14 countries got mixed and it accidentally no we've
[36:01.080 --> 36:04.880]  got good guys on the inside to a lot of people quietly working to try to stop
[36:04.880 --> 36:12.480]  this evidence and time and history has shown that and I mentioned a of the
[36:12.480 --> 36:15.400]  Australian newspaper says with these multiple jabs they see higher
[36:15.400 --> 36:19.880]  mortality and morbidity so I thought I'd read the definitions thank jaren for
[36:19.880 --> 36:26.920]  getting us the quality or condition of being mortal
[36:28.360 --> 36:33.040]  mortals considered as a group the human race death especially of large
[36:33.040 --> 36:39.640]  numbers heavy loss of life death rate he's saying we're having high mortality
[36:39.640 --> 36:50.040]  that means death death rate okay here's the other one morbidity the quality of
[36:50.040 --> 36:56.800]  being morbid morbidness the rate of increase of disease and death see
[36:56.800 --> 36:59.640]  because I have these arguments with people I've had them on national
[36:59.640 --> 37:02.240]  British radio I go well they're calling for global government they go no
[37:02.240 --> 37:08.800]  they're not we're calling for governance governance means government hey it's a
[37:08.800 --> 37:20.160]  game it's like if I if I gave shooting you in the head a different name it would
[37:20.160 --> 37:28.200]  still be shooting you in the head oh boy so we're gonna put a big alert out on
[37:28.200 --> 37:32.960]  this because I mean I thought two weeks ago when it started coming out that
[37:32.960 --> 37:37.560]  these flu shot test in Texas are killing large percentages of people to take
[37:37.560 --> 37:41.680]  it mainstream news in Europe and that secret documents were released and that
[37:41.680 --> 37:46.360]  people inside the medical community are leaking these this is confirmed and then
[37:46.360 --> 37:51.600]  I go on talk show after talk show and get laughed at about this this isn't
[37:51.600 --> 38:00.440]  funny this is real and you can't just sit there and say it isn't killing people
[38:00.440 --> 38:14.840]  I've got a family I've got children I know a lot of you do too and I am
[38:14.840 --> 38:25.360]  seriously concerned about what sampling now if we can get the word out on this
[38:25.360 --> 38:29.080]  they're not gonna be able to carry this out as big and bad as they're planning
[38:29.080 --> 38:34.160]  but I mean I would have thought I mean I've got a good credit where credit's
[38:34.160 --> 38:39.800]  due Kenny Romire does weekday shows and weekend shows on news radio 590 a.m. I
[38:39.800 --> 38:44.560]  tend to disagree with him on a lot of things he covers locally but I heard him
[38:44.560 --> 38:49.160]  last week on his own show just when I was randomly listening jaren heard it on
[38:49.160 --> 38:53.680]  a separate show he was on going that the secretary of health and human services
[38:53.680 --> 38:59.800]  needs to be questioned about the secret CDC reports that are in mainstream
[38:59.800 --> 39:05.280]  British and German news confirmed that it's killing people and then he gave
[39:05.280 --> 39:08.400]  credit where credit was due he said the only show I hear talking about this is
[39:08.400 --> 39:13.320]  Alex Jones and even though Kenny and I disagree on wars and you know he's a big
[39:13.320 --> 39:16.920]  Republican and all this stuff at least the guy cares about people's health and
[39:16.920 --> 39:22.760]  can see that this is a big issue I mean even people that disagree with me on
[39:22.760 --> 39:28.520]  probably 50% of things he's the only other US media and he's a local radio
[39:28.520 --> 39:34.120]  host where is it I mean maybe you can email me listeners or send them to
[39:34.120 --> 39:39.520]  show tips and info wars.com I've done searches I mean is the British and
[39:39.520 --> 39:43.680]  German news and confirmed CDC document that this is killing people and that
[39:43.680 --> 39:48.040]  they're really concerned and then it's mutating I mean is that anywhere in US
[39:48.040 --> 39:54.440]  news because I can't find it maybe it is maybe it is I mean I can't keep track of
[39:54.440 --> 40:01.840]  everything but this is serious and it needs to be debated I don't want to just
[40:01.840 --> 40:06.920]  sit here and not do anything and then what do we do I think I'm gonna announce
[40:06.920 --> 40:10.520]  the winner today coming up an hour or so and the winner of first place second
[40:10.520 --> 40:14.600]  place and third place in fact guys I get so busy on this flu thing I printed up
[40:14.600 --> 40:18.600]  the three winners and then left them at my house I gotta call my wife and see if
[40:18.600 --> 40:24.480]  she can find them or we can dig them up I know first and second place by name
[40:24.480 --> 40:30.920]  the third place I forget the name of the video but whatever we're gonna do
[40:30.920 --> 40:34.640]  another contest that I'm going to announce today but I've got to write it up
[40:34.640 --> 40:39.880]  and think it up and you know put it on paper so it's specific and so day one
[40:39.880 --> 40:46.480]  it says follow your local laws but we showed the power of posters now we're
[40:46.480 --> 40:50.880]  going to do another poster contest where you can do it unleash your creative
[40:50.880 --> 41:00.320]  capacity any way you want as long as it explains that the flu is the flu shots
[41:00.320 --> 41:06.760]  are killing people and I said this last week when I had the idea for this we
[41:06.760 --> 41:09.800]  need to create a simple naming website and I forgot to tell my guys to buy that
[41:09.800 --> 41:15.200]  remind me during the break guys to tell you the URL we've got to find one easy
[41:15.200 --> 41:20.360]  to remember so we can have just basic data on it for people that see it and
[41:20.360 --> 41:24.200]  then that's part of the poster contest or however you want to get the word out
[41:24.200 --> 41:28.640]  I mean we've got to tell people because our media won't tell you that they're
[41:28.640 --> 41:34.760]  killing people all right we're gonna go to of the next five six minutes or so
[41:34.760 --> 41:40.360]  I'm gonna get back into this top story we're gonna go to the one of the
[41:40.360 --> 41:45.840]  inventors Tyler Palmer one of the founders of a color blue has been with
[41:45.840 --> 41:56.120]  the company since its beginning and it's just an amazing amazing system that
[41:56.120 --> 42:00.800]  he helped design and put together and it's the best atmospheric water generator
[42:00.800 --> 42:06.520]  I found out there bar none and so he joins us Tyler Palmer Tyler thanks for
[42:06.520 --> 42:11.200]  coming on thank you Alex it's a pleasure to be on again and thanks to all the
[42:11.200 --> 42:19.720]  listeners and customers that you have bar none the best audience I have ever
[42:19.720 --> 42:27.040]  had a pleasure of having his customers yeah they are great people we're gonna
[42:27.040 --> 42:29.520]  get into the color blue for a few minutes here in a second but Tyler I
[42:29.520 --> 42:33.200]  know you've been a listener for years that's why whenever I had tested a few
[42:33.200 --> 42:36.480]  out and found your system to be the best and I called you up to become a
[42:36.480 --> 42:39.360]  sponsor it was a match made in heaven you were already a listener for many
[42:39.360 --> 42:44.800]  years what are you doing with your family I mean what's your take on the
[42:44.800 --> 42:50.520]  fact that that they admit the flu vaccine is killing a large percentage of
[42:50.520 --> 42:54.160]  people to take it and then there's a news blackout in the US I mean is that
[42:54.160 --> 43:01.600]  not a big story it's a huge story and people really need to become aware of
[43:01.600 --> 43:08.960]  what is going on with viruses learn learn how viruses work learn about the H1
[43:08.960 --> 43:17.040]  in one virus protect yourself isolate yourself when there are outbreaks but by
[43:17.040 --> 43:24.520]  no means go in and donate more genetic information to the virus so that it
[43:24.520 --> 43:33.000]  can mutate and and you know become even more virulent and I'm what I mean by
[43:33.000 --> 43:39.000]  that is if you if you go in and you get these these vaccines and they just end
[43:39.000 --> 43:46.280]  up allowing which they don't kill all of the the virus that's infecting you you're
[43:46.280 --> 43:53.280]  left with small amounts of that virus that is mutated and then that that little
[43:53.280 --> 44:02.160]  virus has resistance to the vaccine and you end up making things stronger not
[44:02.160 --> 44:08.600]  not helping people you know it in well yeah they admit at least in the US I've
[44:08.600 --> 44:12.080]  seen a reports going oh yes it's going to mutate when people take three
[44:12.080 --> 44:15.440]  different variants of it and then actually cook it up in the body and
[44:15.440 --> 44:19.720]  that's what was happening with the Baxter stuff and and that was the big
[44:19.720 --> 44:23.160]  concern was it was the perfect incubator once you had the bird flu mixed
[44:23.160 --> 44:27.000]  with regular flu inside of you to create that but thank God that got stopped
[44:27.000 --> 44:33.360]  now they're going to mix a vaccine with a virus that is going to mutate and then
[44:33.360 --> 44:38.400]  here's here's associated press this is the they are reporting in the US that in
[44:38.400 --> 44:42.840]  Europe and Asia and Africa the polio vaccine is mutating and killing people
[44:42.840 --> 44:48.680]  so far 124 Nigerian children have been paralyzed this year from the flu
[44:48.680 --> 44:54.320]  vaccine it's from the polio vaccine itself and and TV and radio and news are
[44:54.320 --> 45:01.000]  picking up on this AP report but not that the flu shot is killing people well
[45:01.000 --> 45:06.240]  yeah I mean we have to mourn Michael Jackson and we have to make sure that
[45:06.240 --> 45:12.680]  we we have this vapid debate about health care instead of actually paying
[45:12.680 --> 45:19.600]  attention to what's really going on it is it is something that it doesn't
[45:19.600 --> 45:26.840]  surprise me one of the things that that has has become very apparent to me in
[45:26.840 --> 45:33.120]  the last few weeks is how how close the new world order is how how close the war
[45:33.120 --> 45:41.200]  is the front line of the war is spot every day by members of that below blue
[45:41.200 --> 45:48.960]  and the listeners of this show let's get into that I mean people most
[45:48.960 --> 45:53.920]  my listeners understand atmospheric you know John water generators those units
[45:53.920 --> 45:57.200]  have got to be fixed in the South Range by mid-day or they'll be held to pay I
[45:57.200 --> 45:59.840]  mean you know that's basically what they have in Star Wars out in the desert
[45:59.840 --> 46:04.400]  right moisture evaporator this is grabbing water out of the air and then
[46:04.400 --> 46:08.120]  sending it through seven filters by the way Jesse Ventura says thank you he
[46:08.120 --> 46:15.000]  loves his excellent I'm glad he's having a good time with that I wanted to know
[46:15.000 --> 46:19.120]  the outcome of that but I didn't want to disturb him well the last issue is now
[46:19.120 --> 46:23.600]  he's like oh but I need this in the Baja what type of solar panel should I buy
[46:23.600 --> 46:28.080]  so I need to talk to you off air about what to do what type to tell him to get
[46:28.080 --> 46:32.160]  but yeah I can I can help you out with that for sure I mean I know you guys
[46:32.160 --> 46:37.040]  also it's not just a solar panel you happen to have the converter just for
[46:37.040 --> 46:45.240]  the Ecolobloom that's right and you need a sinus ladle DC to AC inverter so solar
[46:45.240 --> 46:52.120]  panels produce direct current and the Ecoloblue runs off of alternating current
[46:52.120 --> 46:59.920]  and if you don't have a very clean sine wave you end up having a sort of a
[46:59.920 --> 47:05.240]  noisy operating machine and it will still operate but not nearly as
[47:05.240 --> 47:13.080]  efficiently as if you have a sinusoidal converter so yes I we we have all of
[47:13.080 --> 47:19.320]  that all of those products and all of the information and we can steer
[47:19.320 --> 47:26.040]  listeners to other websites even if we don't have to carry it and we also have
[47:26.040 --> 47:33.080]  big machines machines that make up to 5,000 liters of fresh water a day so
[47:33.080 --> 47:39.920]  you know if you want to really be out there and be independent of the grid
[47:39.920 --> 47:47.640]  Ecoloblue is the way to go. Ecoloblue.com and the again website is

[53:10.840 --> 53:16.840]  powerful just as strong just as well funded the Obama deception completely
[53:16.840 --> 53:20.680]  destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American
[53:20.680 --> 53:25.920]  people while Obama's already fudging yeah but since day one in this election if
[53:25.920 --> 53:30.280]  you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who
[53:30.280 --> 53:35.640]  is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs
[53:35.640 --> 53:41.080]  that's fascism it's not about left-to-right it's about a one-world government this
[53:41.080 --> 53:48.000]  film documents who Obama works for the lies he is told and his real agenda get

[54:46.440 --> 54:55.720]  support great unit we've got Bob Chapman coming up in about 30 minutes but I
[54:55.720 --> 55:00.480]  need to continue going over this news but I'm gonna open the phones up but only
[55:00.480 --> 55:06.280]  specifically on the flu issue because we have a giant audience and once a week
[55:06.280 --> 55:12.080]  or so I like to spend at least an hour or two on one big issue because then we
[55:12.080 --> 55:20.280]  can get the whole audience excited about that and then do something together
[55:22.840 --> 55:34.600]  because this is serious I mean when they're trying to vaccinate four and a
[55:34.600 --> 55:39.480]  half billion people that's the number and when they want to vaccinate all
[55:39.480 --> 55:45.840]  300 million Americans and they're hurtling us towards this in just the
[55:45.840 --> 55:50.600]  next few months we have got to get the word out so I want to hear your ideas
[55:50.600 --> 55:54.720]  about if you're a nurse you're a doctor you're being told you've got to take it
[55:54.720 --> 55:57.760]  police in some cities are being told they got to take it some public schools
[55:57.760 --> 56:02.640]  are telling the school kids that they've got to take it what are you gonna do
[56:02.640 --> 56:07.480]  about that what are your ideas of saying no because if we can get enough
[56:07.480 --> 56:11.000]  doctors and nurses and police and school teachers to say no I'm not gonna take it
[56:11.000 --> 56:15.360]  then just like when they tried to order the 14 million first responders to take
[56:15.360 --> 56:23.280]  it in 2002 2003 with the smallpox this whole thing will fall apart and they'll
[56:23.280 --> 56:29.080]  back off and we're already seeing that I heard a news report a couple nights ago
[56:29.080 --> 56:36.400]  and did pull it up and that is that oh they've they've downscaled the 195
[56:36.400 --> 56:41.880]  million first dosages they've you know the government's cut that order down to
[56:41.880 --> 56:46.840]  40 million now I don't believe that for a minute it may be true it may not be
[56:46.840 --> 56:51.760]  true I don't know but then I went and did find where the CDC saying yeah now we
[56:51.760 --> 56:55.400]  only want 40 million for now but we're gonna order a couple hundred million in
[56:55.400 --> 56:59.840]  a few months but they said three weeks ago they'd already gotten 195 million so
[56:59.840 --> 57:03.800]  they may be getting ready to back off so they don't look like buffoons is they're
[57:03.800 --> 57:07.320]  figuring out the public's not gonna take it or they could throw a curve ball and
[57:07.320 --> 57:10.920]  release something that kills a bunch of people to say it's the flu or it could
[57:10.920 --> 57:14.720]  be another mutation of it we don't know we just know they've been building up
[57:14.720 --> 57:18.000]  with mass graves in England the US we told you that before it was mainstream
[57:18.000 --> 57:23.160]  news now it's mainstream news we know there have been really at a level six
[57:23.160 --> 57:26.080]  the last four months now they admit they've been at level six the last four
[57:26.080 --> 57:29.840]  months we were proven right about that we know that they've announced they want
[57:29.840 --> 57:34.480]  400,000 regular army and Marines the Pentagon wants them on the streets
[57:34.480 --> 57:39.240]  during the fall so it is confirmed and we have members of Congress coming out
[57:39.240 --> 57:43.720]  and saying they want to use the flu as a cover for martial law Ron Paul
[57:43.720 --> 57:48.240]  Congressman Brown former Congressman Dick army I mean it's not just me saying
[57:48.240 --> 57:53.160]  this this is so out in the open now that all these big congressmen are saying it
[57:53.160 --> 57:59.400]  and the public's getting it so it's bad it's no doubt they're moving against us
[57:59.400 --> 58:04.240]  but there's no doubt people are waking up and saying no how do we really up our
[58:04.240 --> 58:07.320]  game it's kind of like we're neck and neck in a football game there's one
[58:07.320 --> 58:11.360]  quarter left we're tied we're in the game but we're gonna have to really kick
[58:11.360 --> 58:14.880]  butt here to make sure we win this I mean you understand folks so I'm saying
[58:14.880 --> 58:19.480]  right now during a during a timeout okay what do we do to get refocused and
[58:19.480 --> 58:23.400]  make sure that we go out there and win this thing okay that's what I'm asking
[58:23.400 --> 58:28.520]  you I don't know I mean I'm asking the team right now I think if we put up 10
[58:28.520 --> 58:32.800]  million posters about don't take the flu shot and then have it linked to a
[58:32.800 --> 58:36.600]  website that points out it's killing people that may break this media

[1:01:04.600 --> 1:01:08.160]  with us taking calls specifically on the flu I was looking at my page wrong we
[1:01:08.160 --> 1:01:15.000]  had Chapman on for so long at noon that even though the sheet said one o'clock I
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:21.640]  was seeing the opposite so I got too much going on I got too many things on my
[1:01:21.640 --> 1:01:25.000]  plate so I'm not gonna do a perfect job but you know what doesn't matter I'm
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:29.640]  doing the best job I can that is what matters
[1:01:30.960 --> 1:01:37.800]  we're not gonna use his real name but he's the young man in Florida who
[1:01:37.800 --> 1:01:41.720]  was questioned by police
[1:01:47.960 --> 1:01:52.120]  and the media ended up spinning this whole thing we've got a prison planet
[1:01:52.120 --> 1:01:56.880]  dot com headline teenager at center of Obama poster controversy police watched
[1:01:56.880 --> 1:02:01.560]  me post flyers and he says the whole news report everything is a distortion and
[1:02:01.560 --> 1:02:07.800]  a lie so we'll be going over that and there's another headline here Sydney
[1:02:07.800 --> 1:02:13.640]  morning Harold Obama Joker poster labeled cultural terrorism and the
[1:02:13.640 --> 1:02:20.520]  headline yesterday in the local news was freedom of hate speech and national
[1:02:20.520 --> 1:02:26.160]  international Spanish TV has called for my arrest so we're being trained as a
[1:02:26.160 --> 1:02:34.360]  society that this is all illegal Obama Joker poster labeled cultural terrorism
[1:02:34.360 --> 1:02:38.120]  a Chicago student at the center of the censorship storm after a now famous
[1:02:38.120 --> 1:02:41.920]  image he created of US president Barack Obama Joker of the dark night was
[1:02:41.920 --> 1:02:46.120]  removed from flicker and of course they go to this Palestinian American he
[1:02:46.120 --> 1:02:49.920]  apologized and says I love Obama I was just joking around he's not the one that
[1:02:49.920 --> 1:02:54.040]  put socialist on it and then so they have him like say the whole things bad as
[1:02:54.040 --> 1:02:58.200]  if we're all rebuked now that's how you know they had talk show host on who
[1:02:58.200 --> 1:03:05.400]  first interviewed the gentleman who Chris who we had on yesterday who had the
[1:03:05.400 --> 1:03:11.800]  AR-15 strapped to his back and the host did a great job I mean he admitted the
[1:03:11.800 --> 1:03:14.960]  whole time they went out there with the with the guns to point out we have a
[1:03:14.960 --> 1:03:18.560]  right to a second amendment they admitted the whole time the thing was to get
[1:03:18.560 --> 1:03:26.800]  attention and the CNN spun it oh how dare you how dare you a stage this you've
[1:03:26.800 --> 1:03:30.680]  been caught the guy said caught we put out a press release see that's how the
[1:03:30.680 --> 1:03:35.080]  media does it they act like oh you got caught with a Joker you're so evil you
[1:03:35.080 --> 1:03:38.920]  got caught wanting political attention when that was the whole point of us
[1:03:38.920 --> 1:03:43.280]  putting them up everywhere and a lot of mainstream media says I made the poster
[1:03:43.280 --> 1:03:47.320]  I came out with the idea no we told our listeners to put more of them up
[1:03:47.320 --> 1:03:51.700]  because they were saying it was racist and trying to create the end of the
[1:03:51.700 --> 1:03:55.520]  first amendment in this country see you can't let them silence your speech or
[1:03:55.520 --> 1:03:58.520]  they win when they come out and try to intimidate your speech you got to turn
[1:03:58.520 --> 1:04:07.240]  the heat up a hundred times it's amazing I mean it's like I believe Hitler was
[1:04:07.240 --> 1:04:11.880]  bad and did kill a whole bunch of Jews and other people and when they say
[1:04:11.880 --> 1:04:15.440]  they're gonna arrest you if you come out and say less than six million died I
[1:04:15.440 --> 1:04:18.760]  almost want to come out and say it just because we've got to have a first
[1:04:18.760 --> 1:04:23.720]  amendment I mean we can't get into this position where we're because they train
[1:04:23.720 --> 1:04:28.880]  you on something like that and then they expand it to everything else and then
[1:04:28.880 --> 1:04:37.760]  nobody has free speech so they're now calling my contest cultural terrorism
[1:04:37.760 --> 1:04:41.560]  they're now calling it the other headline in the Hays County newspaper
[1:04:41.560 --> 1:04:45.840]  freedom of hate speech it's you people that are hateful you people that are
[1:04:45.840 --> 1:04:50.480]  on American with this type of crud so we'll come back into all that and a lot
[1:04:50.480 --> 1:04:57.800]  more stay with us we shall return
[1:04:59.760 --> 1:05:04.240]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a

[1:08:27.240 --> 1:08:32.000]  office according to local news and the Miami Herald and the paper also in
[1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:37.880]  Orlando preparing felony vandalism charges for putting them up on telephone
[1:08:37.880 --> 1:08:44.440]  polls he's not the guy that put them up on the federal property they admit that
[1:08:44.440 --> 1:08:49.040]  after the police visited with him other people were putting up more and the town
[1:08:49.040 --> 1:08:53.680]  of Claremont outside Orlando that it just continues and it's all over Orlando
[1:08:53.680 --> 1:08:59.520]  all over Florida it's in London England Tokyo Japan San Francisco Los Angeles
[1:08:59.520 --> 1:09:06.760]  people taking the info wars.com variant of the Obama Joker poster now whenever I
[1:09:06.760 --> 1:09:10.320]  heard the media say a few weeks ago that people need to be arrested that it's
[1:09:10.320 --> 1:09:15.440]  racist and it's hateful that I said wait a minute Obama called for people in the
[1:09:15.440 --> 1:09:20.400]  Washington Post to put his hope change image made by the creator of the
[1:09:20.400 --> 1:09:24.840]  Andres got a posse phenomenon in the last decade nobody ever called for his
[1:09:24.840 --> 1:09:29.440]  arrest he called for his people to put up on stop signs we said follow the
[1:09:29.440 --> 1:09:37.200]  law though most people didn't because they saw the hypocrisy of Obama and we
[1:09:37.200 --> 1:09:40.840]  have a story up teenager at Center of Obama Joker poster controversy police
[1:09:40.840 --> 1:09:45.680]  watched me post flyers and he said the cops told him yeah other people post
[1:09:45.680 --> 1:09:49.960]  stuff so we can't get you in trouble for this but the media spun this and talked
[1:09:49.960 --> 1:09:54.360]  about victims and the community was scared and well here's a clip from the
[1:09:54.360 --> 1:10:01.160]  news from a montage of the San Francisco Joker poster contest folks I think
[1:10:01.160 --> 1:10:03.680]  are probably gonna be the winners I'll be announcing that coming up about 30
[1:10:03.680 --> 1:10:07.840]  minutes here's a clip of a lady saying how scary it is and how horrifying and
[1:10:07.840 --> 1:10:13.480]  there are literally now more than 15 or so I stopped counting at about different
[1:10:13.480 --> 1:10:18.440]  newscast I see new ones every day I mean they're in Chicago saying how scary it
[1:10:18.440 --> 1:10:22.640]  is and you know the Palestinian kid who originally made the Joker poster
[1:10:22.640 --> 1:10:27.120]  without the socialism on it apologized and said it's evil and un-American and
[1:10:27.120 --> 1:10:31.520]  people are in the local Austin papers and and and and the town south of me
[1:10:31.520 --> 1:10:36.680]  saying it's wrong Republicans are saying it's evil it's terrorism they're
[1:10:36.680 --> 1:10:41.440]  saying it's cultural terrorism in the Australian Sydney morning Herald I mean
[1:10:41.440 --> 1:10:48.920]  it's oh my gosh Al Qaeda is attacking so here it is
[1:10:48.920 --> 1:10:54.320]  which is a federal crime he looks so mean and gruesome and evil and this is not
[1:10:54.320 --> 1:10:57.560]  something that you want to as an American to portray your president no
[1:10:57.560 --> 1:11:01.360]  matter what you think you know it's that that's very disrespectful the science

[1:12:35.320 --> 1:12:39.480]  mean there's newscast all over the country freaking out and looking scared
[1:12:39.480 --> 1:12:43.880]  and it's it's gruesome I mean right here in Texas they're like it's scary and
[1:12:43.880 --> 1:12:48.560]  wrong and in the Hays County Press it says like he wants to come get you at
[1:12:48.560 --> 1:12:53.200]  night this needs to be illegal it's like he's a boogeyman we're scared whoever

[1:13:02.160 --> 1:13:05.600]  and the guy says in Spanish because the makers of the poster don't like the
[1:13:05.600 --> 1:13:11.680]  Brown president they need to be arrested I mean you can't you can show George
[1:13:11.680 --> 1:13:17.200]  Bush as a vampire you can show George Bush as a as a goblin or as the Joker
[1:13:17.200 --> 1:13:21.720]  and that's okay the same newspaper the Village Voice that showed him on the
[1:13:21.720 --> 1:13:25.840]  cover as a vampire and as the Joker said it's okay for Bush but not Obama
[1:13:25.840 --> 1:13:32.000]  because he's black this is mind control now giving us the inside scoop he's just
[1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:39.880]  gonna go by First Amendment defender teenager at Center of Obama Joker
[1:13:39.880 --> 1:13:45.320]  poster controversy police watch me post flyers and he we asked him to contact
[1:13:45.320 --> 1:13:51.160]  us yesterday knowing he was a listener and he did contact us and he can now
[1:13:51.160 --> 1:13:55.480]  tell us the whole story sir thank you how old are you I really don't want to
[1:13:55.480 --> 1:13:58.480]  give an info out Alex but it's really great dinner show today I'm happy to do
[1:13:58.480 --> 1:14:04.160]  it well you sound pretty all what are you 17 around yeah yeah okay so you're a
[1:14:04.160 --> 1:14:13.640]  senior in high school I'll guess you're close junior the government already
[1:14:13.640 --> 1:14:17.440]  knows he ours so we're just trying to get a snapshot okay tell us what really
[1:14:17.440 --> 1:14:22.520]  happened well you're absolutely right it is mind control I mean Fox news.com is
[1:14:22.520 --> 1:14:27.440]  now promoting the idea that five years in jail is an appropriate punishment for
[1:14:27.440 --> 1:14:31.000]  distributing flyers so I mean it is you know chilling a free speech they're
[1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:35.080]  trying to scare patriots into not standing up and taking action but as
[1:14:35.080 --> 1:14:41.360]  far as the situation Claremont goes you know after you announced the contest you
[1:14:41.360 --> 1:14:44.200]  know a couple days later I started putting them on telephone poles and that
[1:14:44.200 --> 1:14:50.600]  was it a couple days after that WFTV jumped on it and pretty much turned a
[1:14:50.600 --> 1:14:57.840]  non-issue into a you know statewide pandemic shortly after the media jumped
[1:14:57.840 --> 1:15:02.440]  on I was contacted by two investigators they interviewed me they told me to my
[1:15:02.440 --> 1:15:06.080]  face that they normally look the other way with the city ordinance that I didn't
[1:15:06.080 --> 1:15:09.680]  even know about and I don't think many other people do either and then I wasn't
[1:15:09.680 --> 1:15:13.520]  in trouble for it and then shortly after that you have the media saying that I'm
[1:15:13.520 --> 1:15:17.880]  in jail I'm being interrogated and I'm you know waiting trial okay let me stop
[1:15:17.880 --> 1:15:22.720]  there the media lied a whole bunch of different newspapers and TV said you had
[1:15:22.720 --> 1:15:28.200]  been taken to jail you had been arrested they were in custody police were very
[1:15:28.200 --> 1:15:32.960]  upset I mean it was like war of the worlds as if Bakersfield had giant
[1:15:32.960 --> 1:15:38.800]  flying saucer tripod aliens ray gunning buildings I mean it was I mean it was
[1:15:38.800 --> 1:15:42.480]  people on the news looking scared we don't know what to do we're getting hit
[1:15:42.480 --> 1:15:47.120]  hard this is like the Tet offensive no you're absolutely right they're trying
[1:15:47.120 --> 1:15:51.000]  to make an example out of somebody you know they're trying to make patriots
[1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:54.400]  believe that if you know they do what I did you know they will go to jail they
[1:15:54.400 --> 1:15:57.840]  will be interrogated and you know it's box news comm is promoting they may go
[1:15:57.840 --> 1:16:01.000]  to jail for five years you know just for you know distributing and posting
[1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:07.680]  flyers now specifically can you give us the names of the officers this is
[1:16:07.680 --> 1:16:11.920]  going to be important on record that normally they look the other way but
[1:16:11.920 --> 1:16:17.400]  with you you have to be persecuted because a few ninnies don't like the
[1:16:17.400 --> 1:16:23.880]  message yeah sure it was investigator Sanchez and investigator Lane al any of
[1:16:23.880 --> 1:16:27.640]  I declare my police department they told me through my face that I was not in
[1:16:27.640 --> 1:16:34.120]  trouble and that they normally look the other way so now Fox News keeps writing
[1:16:34.120 --> 1:16:37.480]  these articles they called I called two hours after they called last week they
[1:16:37.480 --> 1:16:40.400]  said oh it's too late we've already written the story on this second one
[1:16:40.400 --> 1:16:47.600]  tell Rob do to call this reporter we've got Joshua Miller's number and tell him
[1:16:47.600 --> 1:16:52.160]  call me before they do another story would you talk if they didn't use your
[1:16:52.160 --> 1:16:59.360]  name to Fox News so the truth can come out yeah sure okay well I'll I will give
[1:16:59.360 --> 1:17:06.480]  your number to Fox News and then they can correct themselves but yeah I know
[1:17:06.480 --> 1:17:09.920]  they're acting like you're this arch criminal but have you noticed that I
[1:17:09.920 --> 1:17:14.000]  would say nine out of ten maybe more of the comments are for you seeing how
[1:17:14.000 --> 1:17:19.640]  hypocritical and asinine this is and it and this big manhunt for you according
[1:17:19.640 --> 1:17:25.760]  to the media which didn't exist did serve though to cause the viral distribution
[1:17:25.760 --> 1:17:29.520]  to expand you know people didn't buy into they just retaliated and said no we're
[1:17:29.520 --> 1:17:32.040]  going we're not going back down we're just going you know exercise our right
[1:17:32.040 --> 1:17:36.560]  even more and you know he said it was nine out ten people will let our land
[1:17:36.560 --> 1:17:40.640]  of fentanyl polls that 59% of people thought that the care control bomb was
[1:17:40.640 --> 1:17:44.320]  appropriate and you know I'm sure that poll would manipulate and spun all
[1:17:44.320 --> 1:17:50.720]  kinds of ways what do your parents think of your thought crime oh I mean I can't
[1:17:50.720 --> 1:17:55.640]  speak for them but they seem pretty supportive of it you know I have a lot
[1:17:55.640 --> 1:18:01.640]  of family we're proud of it you know I can't say I'm not you know my father
[1:18:01.640 --> 1:18:04.880]  was pretty involved in the Ron Paul revolution and campaign and all that so
[1:18:04.880 --> 1:18:10.360]  my whole family's pretty awake at the NWO well now they want to put you in jail
[1:18:10.360 --> 1:18:15.680]  for two years and they want to give you a corner Fox News oh yeah five excuse me
[1:18:15.680 --> 1:18:19.120]  I don't have the article in front of a five years maybe maybe you're gonna go
[1:18:19.120 --> 1:18:22.800]  to Siberia I mean actually yeah yeah some of the salt pit in Ukraine or whatever
[1:18:22.800 --> 1:18:28.680]  well that's what Alexander Schultz and needs and he got ten years for speaking
[1:18:28.680 --> 1:18:32.760]  out and handing out handbills covertly did you know that maybe maybe you'll be
[1:18:32.760 --> 1:18:37.160]  like Alexander Schultz and needs that maybe you'll be up at Alaska a big beard
[1:18:37.160 --> 1:18:41.600]  busting rocks with the commas are standing over you yeah maybe I'll be great
[1:18:41.600 --> 1:18:46.680]  Eve I don't know well I mean you know we joke about this but this is really
[1:18:46.680 --> 1:18:53.880]  happening I now now they say they've gone to the state Attorney General yeah have
[1:18:53.880 --> 1:18:58.440]  you heard if you're gonna be basically like Braveheart taken and drawn and
[1:18:58.440 --> 1:19:02.840]  quartered by the state no ever since I wasn't the two investigators spoke with
[1:19:02.840 --> 1:19:08.000]  me I've not heard anything so again I guess it's all the Brad King the state
[1:19:08.000 --> 1:19:12.200]  attorney on whether or not anything's gonna happen but I'm really not that
[1:19:12.200 --> 1:19:16.440]  worried about being a martyr or anything I think I'm not really even that mad at
[1:19:16.440 --> 1:19:19.120]  the police or anything because the only reason they got involved was because the
[1:19:19.120 --> 1:19:22.600]  media put so much pressure on them they also told me that if it hadn't been from
[1:19:22.600 --> 1:19:27.040]  the media they probably wouldn't even have looked into it now I'm told that
[1:19:27.040 --> 1:19:31.120]  well the news reported that after they tried to thought crime you that more
[1:19:31.120 --> 1:19:35.720]  posters were put up yeah sure no I'm not the only person we are changed and you
[1:19:35.720 --> 1:19:39.080]  know the Patriot movement have quite a presence in central Florida so I mean

[1:25:26.760 --> 1:25:31.120]  Bush as a Joker all that was everywhere all over the country everywhere I went
[1:25:31.120 --> 1:25:40.000]  stuck on walls why didn't the media start getting all scary arrest them I
[1:25:40.000 --> 1:25:45.080]  mean I guess that's because he was like the corporate God Obama was gonna be our
[1:25:45.080 --> 1:25:50.320]  saver and you can't talk about about him well my hypothesis on that is they
[1:25:50.320 --> 1:25:54.360]  they didn't really start allowing that until after Bush was used up by the New
[1:25:54.360 --> 1:25:58.320]  World Order I mean Raptor 9-11 is approval rating was above 90% you
[1:25:58.320 --> 1:26:01.040]  couldn't really say anything bad about them and then towards the end of the
[1:26:01.040 --> 1:26:03.880]  second term when they were all done with them then you could criticize them I
[1:26:03.880 --> 1:26:07.200]  imagine that being the case with Obama too if he's more than a one-term
[1:26:07.200 --> 1:26:09.880]  president by the end of the second term you'll probably be allowed to make fun
[1:26:09.880 --> 1:26:14.480]  of them any way you want man you are really smart yeah why are you so informed
[1:26:14.480 --> 1:26:18.720]  that's absolutely what's going on he's fresh for them he's new bird cage liner
[1:26:18.720 --> 1:26:22.800]  they don't have the next liner ready they want him to the new order bird to
[1:26:22.800 --> 1:26:27.040]  to sully him get take all the blame and then nobody looks at the bird they look
[1:26:27.040 --> 1:26:31.080]  at the paper they could put their next puppet in he was a little bit darker
[1:26:31.080 --> 1:26:34.920]  shade of paper usually we have a white paper bird cage liner and so it was the
[1:26:34.920 --> 1:26:39.400]  novelty of who there's a brown bird cage liner who don't talk about it you know
[1:26:39.400 --> 1:26:46.480]  you so but but but now you we're here sully-ing their little puppet early who
[1:26:46.480 --> 1:26:50.760]  you've committed a very bad boo boo well the same thing with Bill Clinton too I
[1:26:50.760 --> 1:26:54.800]  mean you know they didn't you know the old Monica Lewinsky affair came out you
[1:26:54.800 --> 1:26:58.320]  know right at the end of the second term you know right when they didn't need
[1:26:58.320 --> 1:27:02.360]  them anymore they just destroyed them and you know got rid of them where did you
[1:27:02.360 --> 1:27:07.760]  learn that paradigm what oh I mean I read info words daily I mean I've been the
[1:27:07.760 --> 1:27:13.760]  info war for about a year now I mean all I do is read and learn so well it's very
[1:27:13.760 --> 1:27:21.200]  very exciting what you were doing my friend I just I just cannot be more
[1:27:21.200 --> 1:27:25.160]  excited about what you're doing describe though you're saying that it's just
[1:27:25.160 --> 1:27:29.000]  intensifying that there's more and more posters everywhere that's got to really
[1:27:29.000 --> 1:27:33.080]  frustrate these control freaks these anti-american trash that start
[1:27:33.080 --> 1:27:36.680]  hyperventilating and not over checkpoints and police and black mask and
[1:27:36.680 --> 1:27:42.480]  roadside cameras and open borders they hyperventilate over freedom yeah and
[1:27:42.480 --> 1:27:45.640]  that's why it's even more important that we continue to do it not only do it but
[1:27:45.640 --> 1:27:49.160]  do it even more I mean just I was listening to your interview with the
[1:27:49.160 --> 1:27:53.360]  AR-15 guy Chris yesterday and he says that you know the best thing the Second
[1:27:53.360 --> 1:27:58.080]  Amendment movement can do is to open carry firearms even more and I think that's
[1:27:58.080 --> 1:28:00.320]  how it should be with the First Amendment too we just need to keep
[1:28:00.320 --> 1:28:04.520]  exercising it more and more and more I mean you know if the majority of
[1:28:04.520 --> 1:28:07.440]  Americans without posting flyers there's nothing they could do about it but
[1:28:07.440 --> 1:28:11.160]  when it's just a minority even an irate minority now they're able to make you
[1:28:11.160 --> 1:28:15.080]  know they're able to crucify one person make an example out of them well I've
[1:28:15.080 --> 1:28:18.320]  been saying for years that they've put the message out to kind of the dumb
[1:28:18.320 --> 1:28:21.800]  down masses that don't know the branches of government don't know the time of
[1:28:21.800 --> 1:28:25.680]  day or just kind of going through life and accepting whatever happens that the
[1:28:25.680 --> 1:28:29.920]  billboards and the movies and the images say all guns are illegal so
[1:28:29.920 --> 1:28:35.600]  perception is reality with morons and so we've got to come out and say look my
[1:28:35.600 --> 1:28:38.800]  guns aren't illegal because I don't know if you've seen this but we post it all
[1:28:38.800 --> 1:28:43.880]  the time I mean it's scary even in Arizona and Texas and Vermont supposedly
[1:28:43.880 --> 1:28:48.680]  pro-gun states people get rated every day because a neighbor saw their neighbor
[1:28:48.680 --> 1:28:53.560]  cleaning a gun in the garage or putting in their car and the cops come and take
[1:28:53.560 --> 1:28:57.880]  them and say well you're not allowed to have five guns I've seen three guns and
[1:28:57.880 --> 1:29:03.400]  500 rounds called an arsenal and people arrested for it when there's no law and
[1:29:03.400 --> 1:29:07.160]  then the person gets mad and they call them mentally ill and throw them in a
[1:29:07.160 --> 1:29:10.960]  mental institution well yeah it's just part of the conditioning too I mean it
[1:29:10.960 --> 1:29:14.040]  doesn't even take that now if you get into trouble it takes as a you know a
[1:29:14.040 --> 1:29:19.560]  Ron Paul bumper sticker there you go we saw people arrested for Ron Paul
[1:29:19.560 --> 1:29:25.160]  stickers doors kicked in for Ron Paul signs the DHS report now we know why
[1:29:25.160 --> 1:29:28.760]  cops were doing that it came out after said these but somebody has a Ron Paul
[1:29:28.760 --> 1:29:32.720]  sticker they want to kill cops and so not all cops are stupid just like the
[1:29:32.720 --> 1:29:36.240]  general public but some are dumbard and dirt just like the public and they see
[1:29:36.240 --> 1:29:42.200]  it and go I got one homeover I got one with terrorists that Bob Paul that Bob

[1:32:18.880 --> 1:32:23.560]  American people while Obama's already fudging yeah but since day one of

[1:33:10.120 --> 1:33:15.240]  hardman just made the point that this is like landmines in the info war time
[1:33:15.240 --> 1:33:18.840]  release detonating in different parts of the country different parts of the
[1:33:18.840 --> 1:33:23.480]  world and then as the media comes out from San Francisco to Tyler Texas you
[1:33:23.480 --> 1:33:31.080]  name it and demonizes that people are putting up posters 90 plus percent of
[1:33:31.080 --> 1:33:34.920]  people that we've seen in the letters to the editor and in the comments go well
[1:33:34.920 --> 1:33:38.640]  wait a minute even if you're an Obama supporter everybody was bashing Bush
[1:33:38.640 --> 1:33:42.560]  this way this is the first amendment I mean they hung up posters of George
[1:33:42.560 --> 1:33:46.440]  Washington when he was president they they they glued them up to walls I mean
[1:33:46.440 --> 1:33:53.280]  nobody ninnied over that and making them act like tyrants is the key like three
[1:33:53.280 --> 1:33:57.360]  weeks ago the media said it's all a hoax only lobbyists paid lobbyists are
[1:33:57.360 --> 1:34:01.920]  posing as citizens everyone wants health care and two weeks into that they had to
[1:34:01.920 --> 1:34:05.640]  say okay we apologize you are the citizens you're not Astro turf you're
[1:34:05.640 --> 1:34:10.360]  not Nazis you're not devils you have a right to and then now the whole thing is
[1:34:10.360 --> 1:34:15.240]  falling apart though they may use the whole flu freak out to get that ramp
[1:34:15.240 --> 1:34:18.160]  through we're gonna go to your calls coming up in a few minutes after our
[1:34:18.160 --> 1:34:23.240]  guest leaves us flew only but this is a whole first amendment issue right now
[1:34:23.240 --> 1:34:27.040]  going back to the young man who was questioned by police the media lies that
[1:34:27.040 --> 1:34:30.760]  he was arrested and they said okay he was detained they're looking at felony
[1:34:30.760 --> 1:34:34.680]  charges at the state right now but that sounds like it's just fear mongering
[1:34:34.680 --> 1:34:40.560]  hype by the media to scare people because if the public with his approval
[1:34:40.560 --> 1:34:45.280]  dropping the fastest of any president ever eight months into office lower than
[1:34:45.280 --> 1:34:50.320]  Bush lower than Carter losing a few points a week now if the public manifests
[1:34:50.320 --> 1:34:54.920]  with things with signs on the streets and that's the best way some big protest
[1:34:54.920 --> 1:34:58.640]  where you march downtown the media can ignore that but lots of people at
[1:34:58.640 --> 1:35:02.200]  street corners and flyers and putting them up and talking and doing it
[1:35:02.200 --> 1:35:06.640]  legally and lawfully this can bring them down your your comments on that
[1:35:06.640 --> 1:35:10.960]  sir yeah I think the most important thing for us to do is just you know to
[1:35:10.960 --> 1:35:14.680]  promote a culture of liberty like you said in the Obama deception you know I
[1:35:14.680 --> 1:35:18.520]  tyranny cannot survive in a society where people demand freedom that includes
[1:35:18.520 --> 1:35:29.720]  freedom of speech well I agree with you my friend they they portray that in the
[1:35:29.720 --> 1:35:34.680]  different cities and not just the town you're in but that in Orlando and other
[1:35:34.680 --> 1:35:39.440]  areas that everyone hates it and it's evil and it's scary and and even
[1:35:39.440 --> 1:35:45.160]  Republicans are angry talking to people in your town just on the street what
[1:35:45.160 --> 1:35:49.560]  percentage are saying this is great this is wonderful what percentage are
[1:35:49.560 --> 1:35:56.160]  domesticated castrated slaves I'd say all but about a fraction of a percent are
[1:35:56.160 --> 1:36:00.000]  okay and then that other fraction of percent are the castrated slaves while
[1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:05.240]  I was posting the flyers actually had a couple crazed Obama noise I really get
[1:36:05.240 --> 1:36:08.600]  my face and one of them started taking pictures of me saying he was going to
[1:36:08.600 --> 1:36:13.360]  turn me in like he was some kind of secret police or something of 1984 I had
[1:36:13.360 --> 1:36:17.840]  people you know I mean not people but one person you know call me you know an
[1:36:17.840 --> 1:36:20.960]  effing skinhead you know I'm sitting there wearing a bathing suit and you
[1:36:20.960 --> 1:36:25.480]  know flip-flop she's calling me a skinhead but other than that you know
[1:36:25.480 --> 1:36:29.080]  most people either aid don't care and don't have a problem with it or you know
[1:36:29.080 --> 1:36:33.520]  it's funny well that's the issue that's why they want to radicalize all the
[1:36:33.520 --> 1:36:38.200]  groups and make it a racial issue that's what the media advertises and
[1:36:38.200 --> 1:36:43.320]  hypes whoever is out there and engaging in in you know the really anti-Semitic
[1:36:43.320 --> 1:36:47.400]  stuff turns out their feds every time and that's what I warn all these people
[1:36:47.400 --> 1:36:50.960]  out there who get sucked into all this that you're being sucked into control
[1:36:50.960 --> 1:36:54.840]  groups and that's been proven with Hal Turner and all the rest of it and the
[1:36:54.840 --> 1:36:59.400]  truth is these Obama people keep beating up black people and calling them the
[1:36:59.400 --> 1:37:04.640]  n-word a bunch of illegal aliens in South Texas were attacking the American
[1:37:04.640 --> 1:37:09.880]  flag and calling black officers the n-word that video has gone viral I mean
[1:37:09.880 --> 1:37:14.240]  just just just crazy but but so that's how they were able to go to your house
[1:37:14.240 --> 1:37:19.800]  was because the Obamanoids took photos of you took them to the police
[1:37:19.800 --> 1:37:23.800]  department like good little Maoist Soviets and I've seen them all over the
[1:37:23.800 --> 1:37:26.960]  news they're calling for my arrest they're calling for my death the Southern
[1:37:26.960 --> 1:37:30.600]  Primary Law Center allowed comments to stay up for months calling for my
[1:37:30.600 --> 1:37:36.440]  execution these are really sick people you know they're literally turning on
[1:37:36.440 --> 1:37:39.600]  their own species I mean you know they're they're wanting to deprive you know
[1:37:39.600 --> 1:37:44.960]  their fellow man of freedom well again you're the young man that put up some of
[1:37:44.960 --> 1:37:49.040]  the signs but you said there's a lot of other folks is it accelerating after
[1:37:49.040 --> 1:37:56.040]  they engage in the hoax saying you've been arrested or is it now dying down
[1:37:56.040 --> 1:38:00.880]  around your town unfortunately it is dying down so I do call on any you know
[1:38:00.880 --> 1:38:04.760]  central Florida Patriots to you know keep it up and you know get back out and
[1:38:04.760 --> 1:38:09.680]  do some more but you are seeing the signs up there oh yeah they're not going
[1:38:09.680 --> 1:38:14.720]  away I mean the power of citizens period putting up signs this is what the
[1:38:14.720 --> 1:38:19.760]  Sons of Liberty did they would put up simple broadsheets with a couple lines
[1:38:19.760 --> 1:38:24.320]  of text on it and this brought the British Empire down in the Americas
[1:38:24.320 --> 1:38:31.040]  and they are so scared to death of this and so you're now seeing signs that say
[1:38:31.040 --> 1:38:35.720]  don't take the flu shot what is the image it's pretty funny it's actually a
[1:38:35.720 --> 1:38:41.160]  snake and instead of fang that syringes that was on the flyer it said do not
[1:38:41.160 --> 1:38:46.440]  let me guess so they're using the David D's illustration in one yeah perfect
[1:38:46.440 --> 1:38:51.040]  we'll post that I'm sure D's is happy for us to what a great artist graphic
[1:38:51.040 --> 1:38:55.320]  artists everything he does get seen by millions of people I've seen it with a
[1:38:55.320 --> 1:39:00.560]  snake that's it but but that's not gonna be the contest winner I'm gonna have
[1:39:00.560 --> 1:39:04.040]  another thousand dollar a curtain him out of tune in and write up the contest
[1:39:04.040 --> 1:39:09.760]  rules by by tonight please they're gonna be a thousand dollars for whoever comes
[1:39:09.760 --> 1:39:16.360]  up with the best poster with the best image and D's can be part of it he can
[1:39:16.360 --> 1:39:18.840]  come up with a new image if he wants but we're also gonna post this as an
[1:39:18.840 --> 1:39:24.400]  example that people should initially use and but it just needs to say don't
[1:39:24.400 --> 1:39:29.840]  take the shot don't take the flu shot and info wars dot com or prison planet
[1:39:29.840 --> 1:39:36.280]  dot com on the top so info wars dot com prison planet dot com on the top and
[1:39:36.280 --> 1:39:39.640]  then we'll always have a vaccine area there for people to be alerted we already
[1:39:39.640 --> 1:39:42.640]  have that but we'll make it prominent so I don't have time to build another site
[1:39:42.640 --> 1:39:46.800]  the point is we'll have that up there and at the bottom don't take the flu shot
[1:39:46.800 --> 1:39:51.280]  or don't take the shot and we're gonna have a thousand dollars for the best
[1:39:51.280 --> 1:39:57.040]  poster the best poster that is then also publicly displayed in legal and
[1:39:57.040 --> 1:40:03.120]  lawful way or the most artful way and so the best poster but we don't want
[1:40:03.120 --> 1:40:09.280]  people to wait we want people just to go absolutely ape so we will you guys
[1:40:09.280 --> 1:40:14.800]  ask Janae Meadows or ask Douglas right now to take the David D's you know to
[1:40:14.800 --> 1:40:19.160]  these illustration dot com with the two fangs coming out of its mouth and then
[1:40:19.160 --> 1:40:22.920]  say don't take the flu shot that is genius let's get a simple info wars
[1:40:22.920 --> 1:40:27.960]  prison planet variant of that up in the contest will be whoever can come up with
[1:40:27.960 --> 1:40:32.760]  the best poster and post them best poster so it's not just our posters we'll
[1:40:32.760 --> 1:40:39.800]  send them to contest at info wars dot com and or post them on the web send them
[1:40:39.800 --> 1:40:43.560]  to us we'll put a link to them and we will put those up and again this is
[1:40:43.560 --> 1:40:47.280]  getting everybody I wanted to demonstrate to everybody the power of
[1:40:47.280 --> 1:40:52.120]  people just taking action I don't know if people realize how serious they can
[1:40:52.120 --> 1:40:55.400]  be called the poster revolution in the United States my friend
[1:40:55.400 --> 1:41:00.200]  they can go down history you know like the Boston Tea Party I wonder if they'll
[1:41:00.200 --> 1:41:04.960]  say we're being racist against snakes if we show a snake with with with acid
[1:41:04.960 --> 1:41:10.040]  fangs they were were anti reptilian anti snake they'll probably claim that's
[1:41:10.040 --> 1:41:13.760]  racist but you know what you've got to ignore their asinine attempts to cold
[1:41:13.760 --> 1:41:17.600]  bloodedly silence your free speech of the people doing this listen you've got
[1:41:17.600 --> 1:41:19.960]  the floor of the last few minutes say whatever you like said to me just
[1:41:19.960 --> 1:41:25.160]  hyperventilating well I mean look I'm just one man and I just post or one boy
[1:41:25.160 --> 1:41:30.160]  I just posted these on telephone poles and I was able to get this story on you
[1:41:30.160 --> 1:41:34.320]  know literally over a dozen you know central Florida media outlets I'm just
[1:41:34.320 --> 1:41:38.040]  one person I didn't even imagine it would generate this kind of you know buzz
[1:41:38.040 --> 1:41:42.560]  so I mean imagine if we all did this I mean you know I mean there's a lot more
[1:41:42.560 --> 1:41:46.160]  of us and there are of them and by them I mean you know the tyrants I mean if
[1:41:46.160 --> 1:41:53.120]  people just realize that if we all post flyers they can't stop us and I just
[1:41:53.120 --> 1:41:57.720]  call on you know all people in central Florida especially to keep it up and I
[1:41:57.720 --> 1:42:01.040]  you know if you haven't joined we are change yet go to meetup.com slash we
[1:42:01.040 --> 1:42:05.640]  are change Florida we'll be passing out free DVDs and stuff for the upcoming
[1:42:05.640 --> 1:42:11.080]  tea party in downtown Orlando yeah I've been doing my own informal study around
[1:42:11.080 --> 1:42:17.880]  the country I would say half of Ron Paul's support is 9-11 truthers and I
[1:42:17.880 --> 1:42:21.600]  understand at a certain level why he stayed away from it because the media
[1:42:21.600 --> 1:42:26.840]  tried to demonize him with it yeah I don't hold against them but I did see
[1:42:26.840 --> 1:42:29.600]  him in that Las Vegas when the lady asking why aren't you covering and he
[1:42:29.600 --> 1:42:34.040]  looks kind of sad and he goes well because I got a lot of other stuff to
[1:42:34.040 --> 1:42:41.120]  focus on and and and you know the code there is hey I got a deal all this other
[1:42:41.120 --> 1:42:44.440]  stuff and I understand that and you know when he's on my show he'll talk about
[1:42:44.440 --> 1:42:52.000]  false flag he'll talk about golfer Tonkin Ajax stage provocations I mean
[1:42:52.000 --> 1:42:56.080]  Paul hasn't told me off the side hammer 9-11 truth or but he knows about stage
[1:42:56.080 --> 1:43:01.240]  provocation and I think he understands though that you know it it might have
[1:43:01.240 --> 1:43:05.880]  been a good move in the final equation because of him holding his cards to his
[1:43:05.880 --> 1:43:10.200]  vest because now look at him they tried to destroy him in the media now he's too
[1:43:10.200 --> 1:43:16.040]  big for that to even happen because they can try to manufacture things they can
[1:43:16.040 --> 1:43:20.640]  try to set him up in hotel rooms they can try to distort what he says edit what
[1:43:20.640 --> 1:43:24.200]  he says you more and more that happens to me man I am seeing stuff where they'll
[1:43:24.200 --> 1:43:28.720]  they will take hundreds of shows I've done and edit it down to set really
[1:43:28.720 --> 1:43:32.080]  slickly you know they're getting the same file source you know going to our
[1:43:32.080 --> 1:43:36.040]  archives so it sounds the same and really doing some nasty stuff and I know
[1:43:36.040 --> 1:43:39.480]  they've been trying that on Ron Paul to we're taking out a context what he said
[1:43:39.480 --> 1:43:44.360]  in newsletters but it didn't work I mean we would it's so exciting what's
[1:43:44.360 --> 1:43:48.000]  happening as we gain momentum so you're calling for folks even though you're
[1:43:48.000 --> 1:43:52.640]  facing hyped up felony charges do we give into this and become the Soviet
[1:43:52.640 --> 1:44:00.320]  Union or do we intensify a tenfold intensified a hundred fold yeah no do
[1:44:00.320 --> 1:44:03.840]  as much as you possibly can you know go to kinko's have a thousand print up and
[1:44:03.840 --> 1:44:09.200]  put them all up well I think it's also important to carry a video camera I
[1:44:09.200 --> 1:44:14.200]  mean San Antonio we are changed was stapling them up the telephone poles
[1:44:14.200 --> 1:44:17.600]  in the bar district where there were already other people's posters everywhere
[1:44:17.600 --> 1:44:21.040]  and Obama supporters white yuppies that look like they were out of their minds
[1:44:21.040 --> 1:44:25.920]  just like so walk over and rip it off because they bought into the corporate
[1:44:25.920 --> 1:44:30.480]  image of Obama which he isn't that image it's a total fraud they they have
[1:44:30.480 --> 1:44:37.160]  completely bought into it and so they just can't get out of it and they don't
[1:44:37.160 --> 1:44:41.520]  want to admit they've been conned you know they're that hardcore 30 40% that
[1:44:41.520 --> 1:44:47.040]  Obama could be doing you know killing children on the White House lawn it was
[1:44:47.040 --> 1:44:50.120]  wife to be doing voodoo dances and you know no one would care around the
[1:44:50.120 --> 1:44:57.440]  manual could be you know doing whatever he wants and they don't care and just
[1:44:57.440 --> 1:45:01.760]  the image of them coming up and trying to get those posters I mean describe
[1:45:01.760 --> 1:45:06.440]  these people to me well no it really does bother them and I don't think it I
[1:45:06.440 --> 1:45:09.760]  don't think they're mad that you know we're mocking Obama I think they're
[1:45:09.760 --> 1:45:14.280]  just mad that you know they're saying you know they're God you know they're
[1:45:14.280 --> 1:45:17.720]  it's almost like the Joker image of Obama is this true image you know he's a
[1:45:17.720 --> 1:45:22.200]  sinister evil untrustworthy you know criminal when they see that just
[1:45:22.200 --> 1:45:26.640]  bothers them a lot and disturbs them but I have faith in them because I mean my
[1:45:26.640 --> 1:45:29.760]  whole family used to be a bunch of Bush supporters including me and now I'm on
[1:45:29.760 --> 1:45:33.240]  sidewalks with a bullhorn saying 9-11 was an inside job so anybody can turn
[1:45:33.240 --> 1:45:37.360]  around I mean we were all there once hey I was to I mean I knew about the
[1:45:37.360 --> 1:45:41.400]  Federal Reserve the New World Order but I was like a kind of mainline Ron Paul
[1:45:41.400 --> 1:45:47.840]  type 14 years ago and now the facts are the facts I mean on so many issues I
[1:45:47.840 --> 1:45:56.400]  have changed my perspective as I learned more and as I realized how this game is
[1:45:56.400 --> 1:46:00.280]  played and so really my job is to describe to people how the game is
[1:46:00.280 --> 1:46:05.520]  played and show people examples of this and more and more once you know the
[1:46:05.520 --> 1:46:12.800]  magician's trick it's game over yeah I mean describe what would they do I mean
[1:46:12.800 --> 1:46:17.080]  they would run up to you and get in your face well I can just recall the first
[1:46:17.080 --> 1:46:22.160]  person it was a you know middle-aged man he ran up to me taking my picture with
[1:46:22.160 --> 1:46:27.760]  a cell phone camera I'm going to report you I'm going to turn you in and you
[1:46:27.760 --> 1:46:31.680]  know I'm asking why because you can't post this stuff this is wrong I said
[1:46:31.680 --> 1:46:35.240]  well I mean this is my first amendment right you know I have to absolutely have
[1:46:35.240 --> 1:46:39.120]  the right to say whatever I want to post whatever I want he says no you do not
[1:46:39.120 --> 1:46:43.240]  know you do not he started calling me an effing skinhead actually he actually
[1:46:43.240 --> 1:46:48.560]  threatened you quote slap the hell out of me but it stopped also but I mean
[1:46:48.560 --> 1:46:52.240]  that's just one of them and I'm not so a bombs quarters like that but but I mean
[1:46:52.240 --> 1:46:58.560]  notice though that in Iran they were pulling down posters and slapping people
[1:46:58.560 --> 1:47:02.240]  in the media was hyperventilating and freaking out it's total selective
[1:47:02.240 --> 1:47:07.180]  enforcement yeah absolutely well I mean they even told me to my face the
[1:47:07.180 --> 1:47:11.160]  investigators that you know they don't enforce this ordinance normally but now
[1:47:11.160 --> 1:47:14.680]  something unpopular has been posted that you know some people don't like that
[1:47:14.680 --> 1:47:17.960]  you know they may have to enforce it well I drive around there's you know
[1:47:17.960 --> 1:47:23.080]  garage they'll sign on every other pool well here is the Hayes County Free
[1:47:23.080 --> 1:47:27.880]  Press and in this article they say oh we don't have an ordinance against this
[1:47:27.880 --> 1:47:35.240]  and it said citizens are at the city council demanding an ordinance okay they
[1:47:35.240 --> 1:47:39.760]  have people demanding to make it illegal that's great yeah because I knew
[1:47:39.760 --> 1:47:43.640]  most towns and cities if you do it in the commons area and you know there's no
[1:47:43.640 --> 1:47:48.080]  ordinance against it and I so I said follow local laws but now they're
[1:47:48.080 --> 1:47:55.760]  saying legislate get out of there in this headline freedom of hate speech these
[1:47:55.760 --> 1:48:00.000]  people are begging to live in a tyranny don't they have any idea that once the
[1:48:00.000 --> 1:48:04.160]  first amendment's gone we're all totally screwed yeah unfortunately they
[1:48:04.160 --> 1:48:07.600]  won't know until they want to say something that is that they're
[1:48:07.600 --> 1:48:10.880]  passionate about and they can't do it they want the freedom till they gave it
[1:48:10.880 --> 1:48:16.680]  away well let me take Michael Savage I mean you know he hates on Arabs 24 7
[1:48:16.680 --> 1:48:20.120]  and I don't agree with that because I'm not here to hate on Arabs hate on Jews
[1:48:20.120 --> 1:48:24.440]  hate on blacks hate on I do I do not like the racial groups that are in the
[1:48:24.440 --> 1:48:27.880]  racial identity that are in all those groups who everybody else's racial
[1:48:27.880 --> 1:48:31.600]  identities bad but theirs but I don't want to be sucked into that but so even
[1:48:31.600 --> 1:48:35.840]  though I disagree with Michael Savage on some issues I thought for his right to
[1:48:35.840 --> 1:48:40.360]  not be banned from flying to England and by the way that got removed when we've
[1:48:40.360 --> 1:48:45.920]  got to support everybody's free speech you think I like the feds posing as
[1:48:45.920 --> 1:48:49.480]  clan members up there saying racial stuff it's now come out in the news to
[1:48:49.480 --> 1:48:54.480]  divide and conquer no but the feds are doing that to get free speech banned
[1:48:54.480 --> 1:48:59.880]  that's the issue because if we come out main line and criticize the system
[1:48:59.880 --> 1:49:06.360]  together then it's gonna fall they've got to radicalize it they've got to make it
[1:49:06.360 --> 1:49:10.560]  racial and religious and that's why I'm always attacked for not making it about
[1:49:10.560 --> 1:49:16.600]  that well that's just why it's even more important to keep posting stuff I mean
[1:49:16.600 --> 1:49:21.040]  even if you know a group of people are able to get a legislation you know
[1:49:21.040 --> 1:49:25.160]  banning you know flyers and posters you know it can still be resisted I mean
[1:49:25.160 --> 1:49:30.200]  yeah that's a pretty just civil disobedience you got one minute we're
[1:49:30.200 --> 1:49:32.720]  gonna come back and take calls for the next 40 minutes that Bob Chapman's on
[1:49:32.720 --> 1:49:37.400]  the last minute closing comments freer hero of the first amendment thought

[2:00:38.120 --> 2:00:43.640]  Watts is doing a big alert major British news as internal CDC documents but I've
[2:00:43.640 --> 2:00:46.840]  already heard about this through the medical facilities people we know in
[2:00:46.840 --> 2:00:51.520]  Houston or there did the first trials a few weeks ago it killed at least 25
[2:00:51.520 --> 2:00:56.440]  people and that's what the medical system covering it up that is big news the
[2:00:56.440 --> 2:01:00.120]  head of health and human services she needs to be asked at every press
[2:01:00.120 --> 2:01:03.880]  conference she gives about this we need to force this issue out there with

[2:01:07.120 --> 2:01:10.080]  like five minutes coming up because but then we'll go back to your calls because
[2:01:10.080 --> 2:01:12.920]  he's a having an event in Austin and they wanted to come on we're glad to have
[2:01:12.920 --> 2:01:19.320]  him Tom in Boston you're on the air go ahead yeah Alex I was in Logan airport
[2:01:19.320 --> 2:01:24.400]  the other day and I was standing in line in the security check checkpoint there's
[2:01:24.400 --> 2:01:28.640]  a guy in front of me sneezing and the airline people that work there they
[2:01:28.640 --> 2:01:32.600]  get the cut in line in front of you and it was funny they were standing next to
[2:01:32.600 --> 2:01:36.680]  me and they're making a comment saying oh oh we can't wait till there's proof
[2:01:36.680 --> 2:01:40.360]  that people have been vaccinated because we don't like standing in line
[2:01:40.360 --> 2:01:46.000]  basically with people sneezing as I approached up to the the woman I went
[2:01:46.000 --> 2:01:50.800]  through the metal detector and there was a woman standing there with two pieces of
[2:01:50.800 --> 2:01:55.880]  paper in her hand and she said put out your hands and I said why she says we're
[2:01:55.880 --> 2:02:00.840]  we're collecting random samples and I said of what and she didn't have an
[2:02:00.840 --> 2:02:06.120]  answer she said just put out your hand see this is huge news I flew two days
[2:02:06.120 --> 2:02:10.920]  ago three days ago and then flew back yesterday the day before the point is I
[2:02:10.920 --> 2:02:15.960]  flew this week and at the Austin airport they had signs about we're doing stuff
[2:02:15.960 --> 2:02:21.480]  for the flu you may be questioned and I wondered what that was and this is what
[2:02:21.480 --> 2:02:24.600]  Bill Clinton's executive order said when you get a driver's license they're
[2:02:24.600 --> 2:02:28.480]  going to take DNA and blood that's now law according to the US code and
[2:02:28.480 --> 2:02:32.240]  executive orders it's totally unconstitutional but it's in my first
[2:02:32.240 --> 2:02:38.080]  film America Destroy by Design made 12 years ago and it's on the books but
[2:02:38.080 --> 2:02:42.520]  you're telling me they're basically taking DNA where did this happen again
[2:02:42.520 --> 2:02:48.320]  Logan airport and again it was pretty funny because when I when I started
[2:02:48.320 --> 2:02:52.280]  questioning the woman she couldn't look me in the eyes Alex she stared right
[2:02:52.280 --> 2:02:55.960]  down to the ground now granted she was kind of a monkey so she probably didn't
[2:02:55.960 --> 2:03:02.200]  really know what she was doing anyway but I refused to do it and they let
[2:03:02.200 --> 2:03:06.680]  me go however I turned back as I was putting my clothes back on after being
[2:03:06.680 --> 2:03:11.560]  violated and sure enough at least four or five people put their hands out and
[2:03:11.560 --> 2:03:16.720]  they they took DNA from their hands sir this is off the chart can you set up a
[2:03:16.720 --> 2:03:20.760]  camera of yourself and send it to us we'll put it on YouTube or you should
[2:03:20.760 --> 2:03:26.400]  tell the story on YouTube more and in fact guys do a search on this samples
[2:03:26.400 --> 2:03:32.680]  being taken at airport TSA points now I don't want to be too mean I don't think
[2:03:32.680 --> 2:03:36.360]  we need these TSA checkpoints it's unconstitutional it's federal it's to
[2:03:36.360 --> 2:03:42.800]  train you to be a slave but in LA both times I flown the last month in Austin
[2:03:42.800 --> 2:03:48.240]  both times the TSA guys are all fans coming up getting autographs shaking my
[2:03:48.240 --> 2:03:54.320]  hand and saying they've gone to my events watch my films they're all nodding
[2:03:54.320 --> 2:04:01.360]  at me they kind of halfway search people so in LA both times and in Austin the
[2:04:01.360 --> 2:04:06.040]  last two times that's four times I've flown you know flying there flying back
[2:04:06.040 --> 2:04:11.520]  flying there flying back two trips both times their fans I had LAPD cops
[2:04:11.520 --> 2:04:16.640]  everyone to the checkpoint go hi Alex and and smile at me LA I mean the
[2:04:16.640 --> 2:04:21.800]  checkpoint guys are fans the cops are fans they I mean I it's incredible I
[2:04:21.800 --> 2:04:26.320]  mean so they all know it's a loaded look I'm telling you man this country is on

[2:04:40.080 --> 2:04:42.880]  good thing you said no a lot of people say no to the body scanners because they

[2:09:02.400 --> 2:09:05.840]  have him pop in about that but first as we were talking during the break Rand
[2:09:05.840 --> 2:09:10.280]  Paul Dr. Rand Paul son of Ron Paul running for the Senate in Kentucky you've
[2:09:10.280 --> 2:09:13.600]  already raised more money than your contrived than your competition we're
[2:09:13.600 --> 2:09:17.560]  gonna get to that but first your take on this airport situation where they're
[2:09:17.560 --> 2:09:21.840]  training us how to be good good little slaves I think we need to stand up to
[2:09:21.840 --> 2:09:27.120]  authority there have to be some among us who are willing to take a stand to stop
[2:09:27.120 --> 2:09:32.000]  the system challenge it in court and really be vocal about it you know it
[2:09:32.000 --> 2:09:37.360]  was really great when one of my dad's campaign staff that Steve Bearfield stood
[2:09:37.360 --> 2:09:40.640]  up and said look I'm just carrying money through the screener I don't have to tell
[2:09:40.640 --> 2:09:44.680]  you where the money came from and they harassed me you recorded it but
[2:09:44.680 --> 2:09:52.560]  ultimately they backed down when he challenged them and then by him standing
[2:09:52.560 --> 2:09:57.120]  up it totally blew up in the establishment's face right and that was right
[2:09:57.120 --> 2:10:02.280]  on the heels of all that targeting of Ron Paul and freedom lovers in Missouri
[2:10:02.280 --> 2:10:06.040]  and he was coming through that Missouri Airport so I think that really did back
[2:10:06.040 --> 2:10:10.440]  fire on them and I think the whole idea of political profiling that in our
[2:10:10.440 --> 2:10:14.320]  country your political thought process is going to make you a target for the
[2:10:14.320 --> 2:10:19.840]  government is a scary concept absolutely we got that my ac report and
[2:10:19.840 --> 2:10:23.680]  broke it we also broke the DHS report and people for the first week didn't
[2:10:23.680 --> 2:10:27.720]  believe it was real because it was so shocking to not just demonize your dad
[2:10:27.720 --> 2:10:34.000]  but even Bob Barr I mean Bob Barr is an okay guy but he's pretty milk toast well
[2:10:34.000 --> 2:10:38.120]  and actually going after all kinds of folks going after people who believe in
[2:10:38.120 --> 2:10:42.440]  gun rights I mean everybody was sort of lumped in there and it's amazing the
[2:10:42.440 --> 2:10:47.520]  sort of the strangest bit of all is you got to watch out for those people who
[2:10:47.520 --> 2:10:55.760]  believe in the Constitution as being some evil doers yeah absolutely there's
[2:10:55.760 --> 2:10:57.920]  just so many questions but I don't want to keep it too long as I know you're
[2:10:57.920 --> 2:11:04.200]  busy specifically tell us about the money bomb yesterday and what it's raised
[2:11:04.200 --> 2:11:09.960]  it's continuing money is still pouring in we set a record yesterday for online
[2:11:09.960 --> 2:11:14.000]  fundraising in Kentucky no one has ever raised this money to money in one day
[2:11:14.000 --> 2:11:18.680]  online we raised about four hundred and forty thousand dollars in one day
[2:11:18.680 --> 2:11:24.160]  online and probably with the carryover effect today we may get close to a half
[2:11:24.160 --> 2:11:28.680]  a million in a two-day period and this does make us competitive with the
[2:11:28.680 --> 2:11:33.320]  establishment candidate and we also had great news last week that there's a
[2:11:33.320 --> 2:11:38.480]  poll that shows us dead even with the Democrat and only a few points behind
[2:11:38.480 --> 2:11:46.000]  the Republican well I want to be honest with people out there you know during
[2:11:46.000 --> 2:11:51.880]  the campaign during the campaign your bit your dad's biggest reason for not
[2:11:51.880 --> 2:11:55.880]  wanting to run when people were pressuring him to do it was that he said
[2:11:55.880 --> 2:11:59.280]  look if I don't win people be disappointed I can be a congressman I
[2:11:59.280 --> 2:12:05.560]  could continue to introduce bills but then I and many others made the point and
[2:12:05.560 --> 2:12:09.000]  and he's even given me credit which I'm honored by you saying I pressured him
[2:12:09.000 --> 2:12:12.280]  you other people pressured him and said look you got to do this because you're
[2:12:12.280 --> 2:12:16.560]  going to get the word out you're going to inject real issues into the debate and
[2:12:16.560 --> 2:12:20.400]  then is everything you talk about comes true down the road that's going to
[2:12:20.400 --> 2:12:24.640]  really build the Liberty movement and as your father has said Congressman Ron
[2:12:24.640 --> 2:12:29.320]  Paul this is blown up hundreds of times bigger than he ever imagined but I did
[2:12:29.320 --> 2:12:34.000]  envision it I understood the what was their grassroots and the move to audit
[2:12:34.000 --> 2:12:38.080]  the Fed and what was happening and I also told my listeners I said look he
[2:12:38.080 --> 2:12:42.320]  probably won't win but you've got to fight as hard as you can as if he could
[2:12:42.320 --> 2:12:46.480]  because we do win and getting the word out and it's not going to be a loss if
[2:12:46.480 --> 2:12:50.400]  you give to these money bombs and then he doesn't win because it's it's it's
[2:12:50.400 --> 2:12:55.760]  educating people and now the biggest movement on colleges is now Liberty
[2:12:55.760 --> 2:12:59.920]  movement freedom movement anti-globalist anti-fed we're shifting the whole
[2:12:59.920 --> 2:13:04.800]  paradigm right now and so you've actually got a chance to win a lot better
[2:13:04.800 --> 2:13:08.880]  chance than your dad did his first big run for president as a Republican I know
[2:13:08.880 --> 2:13:13.440]  he ran as libertarian before that in the 70s and so are the 80s so you have got a
[2:13:13.440 --> 2:13:18.800]  huge chance to win especially since the the other fellow the incumbent isn't
[2:13:18.800 --> 2:13:23.400]  running I know you know that Rand I just want to make sure listeners know that
[2:13:23.400 --> 2:13:28.040]  if we don't put our money on the line and our energy on our line and our and
[2:13:28.040 --> 2:13:32.440]  our voices on the line and our treasure on the line we don't have a hope in hell
[2:13:32.440 --> 2:13:37.720]  here we have got well get behind you and the other thing about it is we couldn't
[2:13:37.720 --> 2:13:41.880]  do it I couldn't be anywhere near where I am now without the patriot movement
[2:13:41.880 --> 2:13:46.280]  that supported my dad and without that movement we couldn't do this but you're
[2:13:46.280 --> 2:13:51.200]  right we can take it to another level and we can win this race this time and if
[2:13:51.200 --> 2:13:56.400]  people will go look at our website Rand Paul 2010.com you'll see how big that
[2:13:56.400 --> 2:14:01.200]  money bomb was yesterday and hopefully people get it excited and keep it going.
[2:14:01.200 --> 2:14:07.000]  Absolutely and I like Peter Schiff but I really like you and especially the name
[2:14:07.000 --> 2:14:11.040]  Paul plus you're a smart intelligent have basically the same views constitutional
[2:14:11.040 --> 2:14:19.840]  views as your father I it's now at $683,000 $683,835 a lot of
[2:14:19.840 --> 2:14:24.240]  males coming in we need to make sure this is a million by the end of the day
[2:14:24.240 --> 2:14:28.120]  or at least by the end of the weekend I mean come on folks Peter Schiff what
[2:14:28.120 --> 2:14:34.640]  raised 870 something thousand dollars and that's great we supported that but but
[2:14:34.640 --> 2:14:40.280]  Rand Paul I mean he's got a real super shot here he needs to raise more money
[2:14:40.280 --> 2:14:44.920]  than Peter Schiff I mean I think that's another challenge out there. I think Peter
[2:14:44.920 --> 2:14:49.280]  Schiff is also a great candidate I've met him a couple of times and I think we
[2:14:49.280 --> 2:14:52.760]  have two good chances really at least there as well we've got a lot of other
[2:14:52.760 --> 2:14:57.080]  Liberty candidates out there to have a shot so I say yes let's keep the movement
[2:14:57.080 --> 2:15:02.560]  going let's stoke the fire stoke the flame but we've got a lot of movement
[2:15:02.560 --> 2:15:07.200]  going on and this is going to now give us the chance to really begin a full
[2:15:07.200 --> 2:15:12.200]  fledged campaign and we've got them scared you can see it in their eyes but
[2:15:12.200 --> 2:15:16.960]  I used to see them at these picnics I'd see over confidence this sort of
[2:15:16.960 --> 2:15:21.840]  imperiousness that they were going to win with no race at all and now I see
[2:15:21.840 --> 2:15:25.800]  they're worried I see crowds congregating on our side we have
[2:15:25.800 --> 2:15:29.560]  volunteers show up at a picnic we've got as many or more than the other guy
[2:15:29.560 --> 2:15:37.240]  every time now. I think it was Julius Caesar said there is a tide in the
[2:15:37.240 --> 2:15:43.640]  fortunes of men when taken at the flood leads on to fortune I would just change
[2:15:43.640 --> 2:15:47.440]  that and say there is a tide in the affairs of men when taken at the flood
[2:15:47.440 --> 2:15:52.360]  leads on to liberty and freedom for future generations and we have the
[2:15:52.360 --> 2:15:56.280]  giant tea party movement we have this bipartisan movement against the
[2:15:56.280 --> 2:16:00.800]  globalist against the foreign banks people are now identifying that both
[2:16:00.800 --> 2:16:05.160]  political parties are by and large controlled by offshore corporations and
[2:16:05.160 --> 2:16:10.640]  if we can get you in the Senate and have you with that bully pulpit in there
[2:16:10.640 --> 2:16:13.720]  blowing the whistle and I believe you won't be compromised I believe you'll
[2:16:13.720 --> 2:16:20.840]  be a hundred percent faithful like your father then it'll just be amazing to have
[2:16:20.840 --> 2:16:26.600]  two polls in the Congress as a wedge to blast open the gates for more candidates
[2:16:26.600 --> 2:16:30.760]  because as people learn that we can have victory as they learn that the new
[2:16:30.760 --> 2:16:36.680]  world order isn't as invincible as they have portrayed themselves as the aura
[2:16:36.680 --> 2:16:42.000]  of invincibility and imperial hubris of the Federal Reserve now evaporates the
[2:16:42.000 --> 2:16:48.040]  people smell blood and it is contagious so I can't stress enough how important
[2:16:48.040 --> 2:16:53.280]  this race for the Kentucky Senate is a senator is really a national position
[2:16:53.280 --> 2:16:58.160]  obviously you'll be representing Kentucky but it deals with national issues can
[2:16:58.160 --> 2:17:02.320]  you comment along that line sir well what I'd say is that you're right the
[2:17:02.320 --> 2:17:06.640]  amazing thing is you know we've had our small remnant that's been growing through
[2:17:06.640 --> 2:17:09.840]  the years the freedom movement the Liberty loving movement the Liberty
[2:17:09.840 --> 2:17:15.040]  limited government crowd but I spent it getting bigger and bigger because when I
[2:17:15.040 --> 2:17:19.760]  see patients who come into my office who are not part of our movement but they're
[2:17:19.760 --> 2:17:23.960]  just part of the general public they sit down in the chair and they look at me
[2:17:23.960 --> 2:17:28.960]  and they say I am worried there is an unease there is a discontent that is
[2:17:28.960 --> 2:17:33.880]  growing among the people and it's not just our small movement anymore it's
[2:17:33.880 --> 2:17:38.720]  spreading throughout the public and it's gonna be something big and if we tap
[2:17:38.720 --> 2:17:44.360]  into it we have a chance to really take back our country amazing tell folks
[2:17:44.360 --> 2:17:48.600]  where you're speaking tonight in Austin and how folks can go well I'll be in
[2:17:48.600 --> 2:17:52.800]  Austin it's not a private home but you can come and you can RSVP if you'll

[2:18:11.480 --> 2:18:20.600]  at Randfall2010.com that's right all right well we really appreciate you
[2:18:20.600 --> 2:18:24.040]  running for the Senate I know you're taking on a lot I know it was a big
[2:18:24.040 --> 2:18:28.160]  family decision you know folks it's a lot to ask these people to run it was a
[2:18:28.160 --> 2:18:32.200]  lot to ask his father to run I mean you get a lot of heat a lot of attacks a
[2:18:32.200 --> 2:18:35.960]  lot of work I would imagine deep down it'd be easier just to stay there in
[2:18:35.960 --> 2:18:39.680]  your medical practice and spend time with the family but you know you're
[2:18:39.680 --> 2:18:44.360]  doing this for your family's future yeah I think we really don't have a lot of
[2:18:44.360 --> 2:18:49.080]  time I mean I think the deficit has become so large they've printed so
[2:18:49.080 --> 2:18:53.400]  much money there's been such an expansion of credit that I fear that if
[2:18:53.400 --> 2:18:58.400]  there's a destruction of the currency that during that chaos is when really
[2:18:58.400 --> 2:19:02.120]  bad things can happen you know that's what happened when we got Hitler in
[2:19:02.120 --> 2:19:06.440]  Germany was during the destruction of the currency and if we have a really
[2:19:06.440 --> 2:19:11.520]  catastrophic or a panic in the currency here we need to have people in place in
[2:19:11.520 --> 2:19:16.840]  office who will be talking about protecting us following the rule of
[2:19:16.840 --> 2:19:21.760]  law the Constitution and not saying give me more power if I only had more
[2:19:21.760 --> 2:19:26.240]  power against these evil people if we put these people in prison you know we
[2:19:26.240 --> 2:19:30.760]  can make you safe again you know all that security we just need more
[2:19:30.760 --> 2:19:34.560]  security and if you get some kind of strong leader like that then it's all
[2:19:34.560 --> 2:19:41.120]  over for the Republic Dr. Rand Paul son of Ron Paul running for the US Senate
[2:19:41.120 --> 2:19:45.160]  out of Kentucky you drafted him he's doing it now put your money and your

[2:25:17.760 --> 2:25:22.600]  the topic of conversation several times they walk by oh there's the guy who
[2:25:22.600 --> 2:25:27.840]  refused the test and so I pulled this stewardess over and I said well look
[2:25:27.840 --> 2:25:31.920]  wait a minute she couldn't even explain to me what the test was why would I
[2:25:31.920 --> 2:25:35.400]  submit to something that I don't even know what she's doing or what it's for
[2:25:35.400 --> 2:25:40.360]  and they said well it's it's for the good of everybody you should have just
[2:25:40.360 --> 2:25:45.400]  done I gotta say this even worse than the TSA are the stewardesses the flight
[2:25:45.400 --> 2:25:49.400]  attendants some of them are real nice some of them are fans I've run into them
[2:25:49.400 --> 2:25:53.600]  on flights to England flights to New York but a lot of them are on Nazi power
[2:25:53.600 --> 2:25:58.600]  trips and they love bullying people around and I mean you know it's just

[2:26:17.760 --> 2:26:24.000]  the air go ahead Bill yeah Alex how are you doing today good my friend okay I'm
[2:26:24.000 --> 2:26:30.200]  a county supervisor here in Wisconsin one of the committee assignments that I
[2:26:30.200 --> 2:26:38.360]  was given when I was elected a few years back was for the County Health Board and
[2:26:38.360 --> 2:26:46.880]  as a believer in alternative medicine I've been very you know perplexed and
[2:26:46.880 --> 2:26:52.440]  alarmed by the things that I've seen over the years I've come to the
[2:26:52.440 --> 2:26:59.040]  conclusion that Lynn Horowitz and all of his information that public health is a
[2:26:59.040 --> 2:27:05.880]  genocide program is correct now yesterday we had a pandemic meeting and
[2:27:05.880 --> 2:27:12.800]  I've been going to all of these meetings this was held at you know one of the
[2:27:12.800 --> 2:27:19.880]  all one of the local prisons for juvenile youth and we were up getting an
[2:27:19.880 --> 2:27:25.400]  update on what their plans were but at every one of these meetings I bring out
[2:27:25.400 --> 2:27:34.440]  information that you've had or dr. Tim penny or the crusader out of Florida you
[2:27:34.440 --> 2:27:39.680]  know I bring it up at the meetings and I get it right in their face and well I
[2:27:39.680 --> 2:27:44.320]  mean did you hear dr. Blalock brain surgeon talking about how it's killing
[2:27:44.320 --> 2:27:49.840]  people and how there's no doubt that it's just absolutely horrible well I
[2:27:49.840 --> 2:27:55.560]  didn't hear that I'm going to have a friend to archive that for me you know I
[2:27:55.560 --> 2:28:02.480]  understand why yesterday I brought out about the Guillaume beret syndrome and
[2:28:02.480 --> 2:28:08.400]  so forth and you know I kept hitting that the World Health Organization is
[2:28:08.400 --> 2:28:15.840]  going to make this thing a mandatory and no no no everything's voluntary but the
[2:28:15.840 --> 2:28:24.640]  local fire chief from the city closest by made the statement you know that he
[2:28:24.640 --> 2:28:31.400]  would have great problems with any kind of mandatory vaccination and that he
[2:28:31.400 --> 2:28:36.920]  would he and his group of firefighters would go into litigation so I thought
[2:28:36.920 --> 2:28:46.280]  this was a very encouraging sign you know so and I I cannot emphasize enough that
[2:28:46.280 --> 2:28:53.280]  as I talk about building the immune system and doing things on a natural
[2:28:53.280 --> 2:28:59.200]  basis to prepare yourself for whatever might be coming they don't want to hear
[2:28:59.200 --> 2:29:06.120]  that at all all they're concerned with here are these shots or the Tama flu and
[2:29:06.120 --> 2:29:13.800]  and you bring up all the negatives about it and it's just off their heads so yeah
[2:29:13.800 --> 2:29:17.800]  they just idiotically want to take a vaccine you want to print off them the
[2:29:17.800 --> 2:29:23.600]  Sunday mail and all these other newspapers where it's killing people
[2:29:23.600 --> 2:29:31.000]  right well I did you know give them that information and in past meetings I had
[2:29:31.000 --> 2:29:35.840]  all the Baxter information so and they still don't care they they still think
[2:29:35.840 --> 2:29:40.280]  it's wonderful well you know there are there are people they're listening and
[2:29:40.280 --> 2:29:45.240]  you know occasionally someone will pipe up and say well I agree with that
[2:29:45.240 --> 2:29:50.880]  gentleman all right Bill always good to hear from you county commensure

[2:32:12.400 --> 2:32:16.480]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[2:32:16.480 --> 2:32:20.200]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[2:32:20.200 --> 2:32:24.400]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid
[2:32:24.400 --> 2:32:27.840]  is dangerously overloaded especially with the high demand summer months ahead
[2:32:27.840 --> 2:32:31.800]  number four the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again every
[2:32:31.800 --> 2:32:35.480]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages number
[2:32:35.480 --> 2:32:39.480]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of

[2:33:27.280 --> 2:33:47.960]  I was on the phone with the news media and that reminds me guys that's why we
[2:33:47.960 --> 2:33:54.440]  gotta hire more people because I gotta watch for infiltrators and this is
[2:33:54.440 --> 2:33:58.000]  literally a cloaking dagger job I have and I'm just out in the open a good guy
[2:33:58.000 --> 2:34:01.080]  trying to tell the truth and I gotta look out for everything I gotta calculate
[2:34:01.080 --> 2:34:05.960]  what people are doing I've got a yeah I'm not whining it's just one hell of a
[2:34:05.960 --> 2:34:09.320]  responsibility people talk about how they're bored I'm the opposite I got too
[2:34:09.320 --> 2:34:13.880]  much stimulus too much crazy stuff I'm getting to the point where oh boy I'm
[2:34:13.880 --> 2:34:18.600]  getting tailed again or you know feds coming up to me doing stuff it's just
[2:34:18.600 --> 2:34:25.880]  just ongoing ongoing insanity and I catch myself where nothing even affects me
[2:34:25.880 --> 2:34:30.280]  anymore like horrible things can be done to me I don't even care anymore and you'd
[2:34:30.280 --> 2:34:33.200]  think I'd want to be to that point of not caring but it's like I've almost lost
[2:34:33.200 --> 2:34:37.440]  part of myself because I'm not even worried about being killed I'm not even
[2:34:37.440 --> 2:34:41.800]  worried about being falsely imprisoned I'm not even worried about I mean all I'm
[2:34:41.800 --> 2:34:46.320]  worried about is other people and it's not like I'm some saint I care about my
[2:34:46.320 --> 2:34:49.680]  innocent children that's the only thing I look at how sweet and innocent they are
[2:34:49.680 --> 2:34:53.520]  and other people's children and I wonder how they grow into these evil adults
[2:34:53.520 --> 2:34:58.640]  that do all this bad crap and none of us are perfect but just the level of
[2:34:58.640 --> 2:35:04.000]  duplicity and envy and lying and everything else in society and then how
[2:35:04.000 --> 2:35:07.680]  good people sit there and take it and then all the positive things that are
[2:35:07.680 --> 2:35:13.800]  happening the great leaps and bounds we're making it's just all on overdrive
[2:35:13.800 --> 2:35:19.600]  I'm gonna go to Lily, Mark, Jerry, Jeff and others all on flu issues and I want
[2:35:19.600 --> 2:35:24.080]  to get Bob Chapman's take on that and some financial stuff but Bob you've been
[2:35:24.080 --> 2:35:29.560]  fighting the globalist since the early 1960s or even earlier and you've worked
[2:35:29.560 --> 2:35:33.360]  and dealt with all of this have you ever gotten to the point where you start
[2:35:33.360 --> 2:35:38.840]  getting almost numb to things and then it freaks you out or or is it
[2:35:38.840 --> 2:35:48.440]  different for you? Well I think it's in part your personality and I came to the
[2:35:48.440 --> 2:35:52.840]  conclusion that I could accept a lot of things that most other people couldn't
[2:35:52.840 --> 2:36:00.200]  and so I really didn't have a hard time with it it was I think I because I
[2:36:00.200 --> 2:36:05.080]  approached it intellectually and the course and I was on the street as well
[2:36:05.080 --> 2:36:11.480]  as a pamphleteer and all that sort of thing but I'm just different and I
[2:36:11.480 --> 2:36:17.440]  just keep on going I won't stop you know I meet people who knew me as a child and
[2:36:17.440 --> 2:36:23.280]  and chummed around with me and they they say oh well we are we always knew
[2:36:23.280 --> 2:36:27.920]  that you were going to be something important because you never gave up
[2:36:27.920 --> 2:36:33.280]  well absolutely I'm not talking about that I'm saying that that I have this
[2:36:33.280 --> 2:36:37.720]  nothing but a passion to fight the globalist that's all consuming to the
[2:36:37.720 --> 2:36:44.960]  point of I'm not I don't even care at all about people lying about me or
[2:36:44.960 --> 2:36:49.000]  attacking me anymore and it's almost like a blindness or something it's like
[2:36:49.000 --> 2:36:53.280]  all these other understandings I have have expanded I don't know how to
[2:36:53.280 --> 2:36:57.120]  describe it it's just really weird. I know how to describe it you're accepting the
[2:36:57.120 --> 2:37:02.840]  fact that the enemy is always after you and you're always exposing what they're
[2:37:02.840 --> 2:37:08.280]  doing and you don't care you don't care what they think I don't care what they
[2:37:08.280 --> 2:37:16.720]  think you just keep on plowing ahead it's just weird Bob to truly become
[2:37:16.720 --> 2:37:21.520]  fearless it it's it's almost like I liked having a little fear it's like I've
[2:37:21.520 --> 2:37:25.280]  lost something I don't but I guess you would say it's gaining something oh
[2:37:25.280 --> 2:37:32.240]  yes because we've risen above them and we're really giving them a bad time and
[2:37:32.240 --> 2:37:38.080]  they deserve it they're evil people and we have the ability to do so so we're
[2:37:38.080 --> 2:37:43.560]  going to do it. Well speaking of waking up I mean every week we talk the
[2:37:43.560 --> 2:37:48.000]  Liberty Movement is just exploding and exploding national news local news is
[2:37:48.000 --> 2:37:53.960]  calling for my arrest freedom of hate speech is the headline for just putting
[2:37:53.960 --> 2:38:01.200]  up Obama posters that say infowars.com I mean the fact that we can shake these
[2:38:01.200 --> 2:38:06.960]  tyrants up so quickly really shows how weak they are they wouldn't be upset by
[2:38:06.960 --> 2:38:11.240]  this if they weren't weak and if they weren't scared of the people rising up
[2:38:11.240 --> 2:38:21.720]  and kicking their butts. Again for the less they're wrong and we're getting to
[2:38:21.720 --> 2:38:26.680]  them you gotta remember these broadcasts go all over the world I mean I talked to
[2:38:26.680 --> 2:38:35.600]  people on on the internet in Paris and London and all over the place and you
[2:38:35.600 --> 2:38:41.640]  know we're doing a magnificent job of reaching the world and these guys in
[2:38:41.640 --> 2:38:45.680]  in the Council on Foreign Relations and the Royal Institute they got to be
[2:38:45.680 --> 2:38:50.440]  banging their heads against the wall how can we get rid of these people without
[2:38:50.440 --> 2:38:56.440]  killing them. All right I want to go to some flu calls so you can
[2:38:56.440 --> 2:39:04.200]  comment on what they're saying Bob they're now backing off partially in
[2:39:04.200 --> 2:39:07.280]  least some reports saying they may not try to vaccinate the entire population
[2:39:07.280 --> 2:39:11.440]  now but they are gonna try to force it on school kids and other people then
[2:39:11.440 --> 2:39:16.600]  mainstream news in Europe here's one of the articles swine flu jab linked to
[2:39:16.600 --> 2:39:22.320]  killer nerve disease leaked letter reveals concern over neurologist over 25
[2:39:22.320 --> 2:39:29.280]  deaths in America mainly in Texas just since they started trials what Bob what
[2:39:29.280 --> 2:39:34.560]  are your ideas to get this out in US media I mean the head of Health and Human
[2:39:34.560 --> 2:39:38.200]  Services should be asked this every time she's in a press conference this
[2:39:38.200 --> 2:39:42.080]  should be top news story that they're getting ready to inoculate a hundred
[2:39:42.080 --> 2:39:45.720]  plus million people with something that's killing a large percentage of
[2:39:45.720 --> 2:39:51.400]  those that take it and the CDC knows it and is covering it up your take on that
[2:39:51.400 --> 2:40:00.400]  and how we get the word out well first of all they have to be doing something
[2:40:00.400 --> 2:40:06.480]  besides giving swine flu shots it's got to be something else in there and they
[2:40:06.480 --> 2:40:11.200]  got it they never do things in a unilateral manner they always have
[2:40:11.200 --> 2:40:17.760]  more than one goal usually several goals when they click a program like this and
[2:40:17.760 --> 2:40:25.400]  push it forward and the worst thing that can happen is that they give it to the
[2:40:25.400 --> 2:40:32.840]  children in the worst thing of all and my daughter's a teacher and she's got
[2:40:32.840 --> 2:40:39.120]  three children and she's not gonna allow them to give the shot to them and I
[2:40:39.120 --> 2:40:44.680]  said well if you do that they may put you an intern and came she said I'll
[2:40:44.680 --> 2:40:49.960]  care she's not gonna get it well I think it's because of that attitude that
[2:40:49.960 --> 2:40:52.720]  they're probably not gonna get away with this I already see some signs they're
[2:40:52.720 --> 2:40:57.240]  pulling back but I don't want to say that too clearly because they may give us a
[2:40:57.240 --> 2:41:01.400]  curveball try something else they appear to be going full steam ahead but I'm
[2:41:01.400 --> 2:41:05.040]  seeing such an awakening that we have a very good chance of stopping them I mean
[2:41:05.040 --> 2:41:08.880]  I want to be honest with people but at the same time then not have folks stand
[2:41:08.880 --> 2:41:13.480]  down and not get involved if we go absolutely wild and post posters
[2:41:13.480 --> 2:41:19.560]  everywhere and say don't take the flu shot and get involved then they will be
[2:41:19.560 --> 2:41:24.120]  forced to back off and then not try it again in a few years if our response is
[2:41:24.120 --> 2:41:28.040]  big enough against them but if we don't stand up and say no they may go all the
[2:41:28.040 --> 2:41:31.480]  way to the wall with us with it with the sterilants or whatever is in it we've
[2:41:31.480 --> 2:41:36.200]  been they've been caught before or they may stop now and try it a year from now
[2:41:36.200 --> 2:41:43.600]  what do you say to that Bob I say that we could do it and you've got the medium to
[2:41:43.600 --> 2:41:49.560]  do it I have a minor part of that but we got to keep on hammering you see my
[2:41:49.560 --> 2:41:55.280]  health section it's never been so big I've got 20 links in the health section
[2:41:55.280 --> 2:42:00.120]  from all over the world explaining how these shots are dangerous and they'll
[2:42:00.120 --> 2:42:05.240]  you could very well kill you we've got people in Europe who is spreading the
[2:42:05.240 --> 2:42:13.840]  information everywhere and especially in Europe the Laroche people are spreading
[2:42:13.840 --> 2:42:20.520]  the word that you know don't take the shots and so yes word of mouth everything
[2:42:20.520 --> 2:42:28.680]  that we can do and I think you're right about the chinks in their armor I think
[2:42:28.680 --> 2:42:33.520]  that they're in trouble with this one and I'll tell you why because they're in
[2:42:33.520 --> 2:42:40.560]  trouble we got a Rasmussen poll of 44 approval rating on the president I think
[2:42:40.560 --> 2:42:45.520]  the Congress has a 12 rating yeah I forgot to go over that guys will you
[2:42:45.520 --> 2:42:50.960]  pull up the Rasmussen is a 44 or 43 I saw that this morning and forgot to print
[2:42:50.960 --> 2:42:56.840]  it well what's the number well I didn't see this morning but I saw the article
[2:42:56.840 --> 2:43:02.120]  this morning when did that come out I don't know yeah I know but I saw the
[2:43:02.120 --> 2:43:07.480]  Rasmussen I think was 44 or 43 just Google president's approval now at 44 or
[2:43:07.480 --> 2:43:11.680]  43 it should bring it up but yeah I mean he's he's losing a couple points a week
[2:43:11.680 --> 2:43:16.960]  Bob well this is a syndrome incidentally I predicted 40 by September
[2:43:16.960 --> 2:43:23.800]  October in January I remember that I'm with this one but but he's got this
[2:43:23.800 --> 2:43:32.000]  medical plan and I'm sure that they'll have some crummy medical plan passed
[2:43:32.000 --> 2:43:37.640]  but most of the stuff that people are complaining about won't be in there and
[2:43:37.640 --> 2:43:46.360]  I think that this has really rattled them and it has cast a poll over the
[2:43:46.360 --> 2:43:51.280]  Democrats because if I had to guess 70 to 80 percent of the people don't want
[2:43:51.280 --> 2:43:56.200]  this medical plan no matter what's in it and then you have cap and trade which is
[2:43:56.200 --> 2:44:00.640]  having trouble in the Senate you get these terrible ratings he had the dollar
[2:44:00.640 --> 2:44:05.540]  going down which is going to affect people and even though they don't know
[2:44:05.540 --> 2:44:15.960]  it yet and I think also besides not making the shots mandatory if we can
[2:44:15.960 --> 2:44:20.280]  push him into that corner then they won't do other things for at least a
[2:44:20.280 --> 2:44:26.200]  while like full flag operations are a bank holiday and things like that and by
[2:44:26.200 --> 2:44:29.840]  the way they're on record saying they're getting ready under level six who
[2:44:29.840 --> 2:44:34.320]  pandemic for forced inoculations lockdowns of cities but now we have the
[2:44:34.320 --> 2:44:38.280]  governor's association and we're going to calls the governor's association
[2:44:38.280 --> 2:44:42.280]  writing letters saying we don't want federal troops the Pentagon's calling
[2:44:42.280 --> 2:44:47.240]  for 400,000 now on the streets of America asking for permission from
[2:44:47.240 --> 2:44:52.600]  Congress showing them who the real boss is we now have Congressman Paul
[2:44:52.600 --> 2:44:59.720]  Congressman Brown former Congressman army saying they may use martial law the
[2:44:59.720 --> 2:45:04.920]  flu generated martial law as a pretext to ram through Obama's agenda what have
[2:45:04.920 --> 2:45:08.880]  I been saying since April that I see that in the fall them trying to get the
[2:45:08.880 --> 2:45:13.960]  cap and trade and the gun grab and the cyber security and all of it the hate
[2:45:13.960 --> 2:45:19.320]  crime all through in the fall with the flu so even if they don't get forced
[2:45:19.320 --> 2:45:25.560]  inoculation the fear mongering and the hype over that just like anthrax attacks
[2:45:25.560 --> 2:45:29.800]  they stage were used to get Patriot Act I see everything coming down to the wire
[2:45:29.800 --> 2:45:35.160]  in October November December so people better be ready because Obama is
[2:45:35.160 --> 2:45:40.000]  cratering he's creating cratering faster than they thought a member Biden said
[2:45:40.000 --> 2:45:45.800]  they knew he'd crater in the first year so this is it folks this is game make
[2:45:45.800 --> 2:45:52.080]  it or break it time this is sudden death over time we need everybody 110% to get
[2:45:52.080 --> 2:45:56.600]  juiced up psychologically and intellectually and go absolutely wild
[2:45:56.600 --> 2:46:00.320]  we need everybody to go ape right now screaming yelling getting the word out
[2:46:00.320 --> 2:46:04.600]  letting the establishment know we see them and we see the terrorist and
[2:46:04.600 --> 2:46:07.360]  murderers and criminals they are let's take a call
[2:46:07.360 --> 2:46:13.160]  Lily in Arizona thanks for holding go ahead hi Alex hi Bob it's an honor to be
[2:46:13.160 --> 2:46:19.880]  with you on the show I have a few points about the flu the hype and I grew up in
[2:46:19.880 --> 2:46:24.440]  Eastern Europe under communism and coming from that background I can see a lot of
[2:46:24.440 --> 2:46:31.920]  things they're coming together with what they're trying to do the people and just
[2:46:31.920 --> 2:46:37.080]  like you said I've been listening to a show for a while and I realize what a
[2:46:37.080 --> 2:46:43.480]  lie they're trying to push on people I mean nothing but lies and I don't understand
[2:46:43.480 --> 2:46:49.560]  how people cannot see right through the lies because growing up we were we grew
[2:46:49.560 --> 2:46:54.640]  up not trusting the government that was your life depended on that you know one
[2:46:54.640 --> 2:46:58.720]  out of three people were informants so you really did not know who you're
[2:46:58.720 --> 2:47:02.640]  talking to so you have to keep to yourself that's what they're trying to
[2:47:02.640 --> 2:47:06.480]  do to stifle the First Amendment if they succeed in doing that this country is
[2:47:06.480 --> 2:47:11.160]  going down the tubes and I really I would hate to see this happen and I
[2:47:11.160 --> 2:47:15.960]  wonder myself and I asked myself and how did America get to this point and
[2:47:15.960 --> 2:47:22.080]  why people are taking the liberties for granted and they're not thinking one
[2:47:22.080 --> 2:47:26.560]  point that I want to make and I want people to think about it why would
[2:47:26.560 --> 2:47:32.440]  Kathleen Sebelius give vaccine makers immunity if there's nothing wrong with
[2:47:32.440 --> 2:47:41.400]  those vaccines why why people don't ask that question well and and and Lily you
[2:47:41.400 --> 2:47:44.920]  know most people didn't grow up in Eastern Europe under what we're going
[2:47:44.920 --> 2:47:49.040]  into that's why why did smallpox kill Native Americans but wouldn't kill the
[2:47:49.040 --> 2:47:54.400]  Anglos because the natives had never been exposed to it just like we've
[2:47:54.400 --> 2:47:59.320]  never been exposed to real hardcore tyranny so the average Dumbo doesn't
[2:47:59.320 --> 2:48:03.320]  know that because they've never come up against it those of us that haven't
[2:48:03.320 --> 2:48:07.400]  lived under tyranny but studied history we know what it looks like you've lived
[2:48:07.400 --> 2:48:10.760]  under it you know what it looks like Bob fought it when he was fighting the
[2:48:10.760 --> 2:48:15.840]  communist he's knows what it looks like and that's what's so sad about these
[2:48:15.840 --> 2:48:20.080]  yuppies that giggle and laugh and think it's all funny they don't know that this
[2:48:20.080 --> 2:48:24.640]  is hardcore classical tyranny that's coming down on us Bob and then another
[2:48:24.640 --> 2:48:29.080]  comment from Lily Bob comments on what Lily was saying well I think she's
[2:48:29.080 --> 2:48:34.480]  absolutely right people haven't experienced it and America has never
[2:48:34.480 --> 2:48:40.480]  collectively really had a bad day in their life I know we've had wars in
[2:48:40.480 --> 2:48:46.800]  and Vietnam and and and you know for the living most of the people from World
[2:48:46.800 --> 2:48:52.080]  War two are gone and we had the war in Korea and now we've got these actions
[2:48:52.080 --> 2:48:59.400]  in in the Middle East but what besides that most people didn't get involved and
[2:48:59.400 --> 2:49:06.880]  they don't know what bad is I mean they just go to their job and have their
[2:49:06.880 --> 2:49:11.120]  families and so on and so forth and they they believe the government will fix it
[2:49:11.120 --> 2:49:15.960]  that they believe this propaganda and so we have to reach them so they hear the
[2:49:15.960 --> 2:49:21.200]  other side of the story the truth well what our job and what Lily said is so
[2:49:21.200 --> 2:49:26.360]  key I said it in a long form earlier but she just like a laser beam said if they
[2:49:26.360 --> 2:49:31.000]  get you to only study yourself if they get you afraid and chilled to pull in
[2:49:31.000 --> 2:49:35.120]  your antennas and not be involved they win the minute that's why they're
[2:49:35.120 --> 2:49:38.600]  out saying you don't like the president you don't want to turn your guns in
[2:49:38.600 --> 2:49:43.200]  racist you don't like wrong well that's what the Soviets did I mean I'm
[2:49:43.200 --> 2:49:48.280]  explain that to people if we've got to speak up now or it's over yes I I
[2:49:48.280 --> 2:49:53.920]  remember my grandfather telling me he lived in the 40s and the 50s when the
[2:49:53.920 --> 2:49:58.080]  communist state took power and he said that they came and took everything from
[2:49:58.080 --> 2:50:01.920]  the people and got rid of the ones they're vocal the ones that fought
[2:50:01.920 --> 2:50:05.880]  against them but then when jail killed them they disappeared forever they took
[2:50:05.880 --> 2:50:11.440]  everything my grandfather told me they took their animals the cattle the plows
[2:50:11.440 --> 2:50:18.880]  everything they left them destitute and it's people don't hear don't understand
[2:50:18.880 --> 2:50:23.400]  it I'm like I'm looking at people I said how can you not see what's coming how
[2:50:23.400 --> 2:50:28.760]  can you not see how everything it's like a puzzle they're putting the pieces
[2:50:28.760 --> 2:50:32.720]  into place the good of everybody that was the favorite
[2:50:32.720 --> 2:50:37.360]  phrase phrase of the communists that all you heard for the good for the common
[2:50:37.360 --> 2:50:43.480]  good who's good well I want to have you have a minute or so Lily on the other
[2:50:43.480 --> 2:50:47.080]  side to finish up Maria to Mark Jerry Jeff Lou and others hold we're no Bob over

[2:55:41.440 --> 2:55:45.880]  anything else you want to add you were talking about your grandfather you're
[2:55:45.880 --> 2:55:49.840]  talking about well that's why I held you over about how they always say it's
[2:55:49.840 --> 2:55:55.520]  for everyone it's for the children it's for the greater good finish up with that
[2:55:55.520 --> 2:56:02.320]  thought well the only good was for the ones for the dogs at the top because they
[2:56:02.320 --> 2:56:07.400]  had everything and everybody else was starving that's that's the group the
[2:56:07.400 --> 2:56:11.560]  good of everyone though everyone at the top that is which is probably what the
[2:56:11.560 --> 2:56:18.480]  1% 0.5% you know you never know but the corruption they went on while the whole
[2:56:18.480 --> 2:56:25.360]  country was starving and it started with putting fear in people to speak their
[2:56:25.360 --> 2:56:30.280]  mind because they arrested those they were vocal in the beginning and they
[2:56:30.280 --> 2:56:34.320]  chilled they had it had a chilling effect on everybody and everybody would
[2:56:34.320 --> 2:56:39.240]  would drew within and they did not they were afraid to speak out I think there's
[2:56:39.240 --> 2:56:43.440]  a great movie that was made in Germany a couple of years ago it's called the
[2:56:43.440 --> 2:56:48.280]  lives of others it's in German with English subtitle I think everyone should
[2:56:48.280 --> 2:56:53.800]  watch that movie it's a it's a perfect description what life behind a curtain
[2:56:53.800 --> 2:56:59.640]  was well did you hear the callers well the particular fellow that they're
[2:56:59.640 --> 2:57:03.760]  wanting to indict saying that Obama supporters would run up and take photos
[2:57:03.760 --> 2:57:08.760]  and say I'm reporting you and then Obama told people report on your neighbors if
[2:57:08.760 --> 2:57:13.760]  they criticize me I mean he really is a very very wicked person people are so
[2:57:13.760 --> 2:57:20.200]  stupid because what they do not understand is that you report someone
[2:57:20.200 --> 2:57:25.920]  today you are a term your your turn is coming back next tomorrow because they're
[2:57:25.920 --> 2:57:31.320]  gonna turn against you if there is no loyalty so people need to understand that
[2:57:31.320 --> 2:57:36.000]  and bend together people should work together not against each other because
[2:57:36.000 --> 2:57:44.920]  are the enemy is not the people and people do not understand that and I have
[2:57:44.920 --> 2:57:51.120]  a few words of caution for Christians Christians better wake up and not wait
[2:57:51.120 --> 2:57:55.240]  for the rapture because that's not gonna happen before the trouble they better
[2:57:55.240 --> 2:58:00.080]  wake up because they've the same thing happened in China where were you from in
[2:58:00.080 --> 2:58:05.160]  Eastern Europe Romania Romania yeah well God bless you call back in again

[2:58:09.880 --> 2:58:15.200]  people to hear that testimony but I mean did you think you'd ever see an
[2:58:15.200 --> 2:58:20.560]  American president saying rat on your neighbors if they criticize me the only
[2:58:20.560 --> 2:58:28.840]  place I heard that was in communist countries or in Nazi Germany it's just
[2:58:28.840 --> 2:58:32.320]  incredible to see it happening and to know these big offshore banks are
[2:58:32.320 --> 2:58:37.600]  funding this fake communist system to steal all our wealth Bob stay there back

[2:59:58.840 --> 3:00:01.440]  network
[3:00:01.440 --> 3:00:13.320]  okay real fast Mark and Oregon you're on the air with Bob Chatton go ahead Mark
[3:00:14.680 --> 3:00:22.920]  go ahead hi Alex and Bob how y'all doing today Alex a massive poster campaign on
[3:00:22.920 --> 3:00:28.200]  the vaccination deception is certainly an order no doubt not just in the United
[3:00:28.200 --> 3:00:31.760]  States but throughout the world now additionally forming groups of
[3:00:31.760 --> 3:00:37.240]  organized and public protest and public exposure that will force the mass media
[3:00:37.240 --> 3:00:41.400]  of this country in the world to report on the deadly ingredients of the
[3:00:41.400 --> 3:00:46.480]  upcoming global vaccinations I think would also be powerful as well as an
[3:00:46.480 --> 3:00:51.040]  expedited production and release of a video by yourself perhaps titled the
[3:00:51.040 --> 3:00:54.480]  vaccination deception all right let me be clear let me be clear that's a great
[3:00:54.480 --> 3:00:58.260]  idea of vaccination deception I've interviewed ten penny and others there
[3:00:58.260 --> 3:01:03.600]  is a section in the new film about the vaccine it's just it's coming out right
[3:01:03.600 --> 3:01:07.240]  in October and they may back off by then so I need to make it just about how
[3:01:07.240 --> 3:01:11.720]  they use overall vaccine systems but going back to Bob Chapman Bob isn't just
[3:01:11.720 --> 3:01:16.080]  the idea of lots of posters lets people get the idea that other people are
[3:01:16.080 --> 3:01:22.720]  upset it's harder to go form groups out of this you can form groups that's
[3:01:22.720 --> 3:01:27.800]  correct and also you have existing groups that you would introduce these
[3:01:27.800 --> 3:01:31.520]  you know poster to and said look if you're gonna do this you gotta do that
[3:01:31.520 --> 3:01:37.760]  too because they're gonna would disagree with the vaccination process so you
[3:01:37.760 --> 3:01:41.840]  would get a hold of those groups and introduce them to posters and say put
[3:01:41.840 --> 3:01:46.720]  them up everywhere and I've done that before of course I'm a little old for
[3:01:46.720 --> 3:01:52.040]  it now but during political campaigns well you know we go out and and from
[3:01:52.040 --> 3:01:57.800]  10 o'clock at night to 6 o'clock in the morning and put posters everywhere yeah
[3:01:57.800 --> 3:02:01.360]  there's nothing more American nothing more pro-liberty and the fact the
[3:02:01.360 --> 3:02:06.400]  government's trying to demonize it is outrageous San Francisco won first place
[3:02:06.400 --> 3:02:10.680]  the guys that did lower Manhattan you won second place and I'm watching all
[3:02:10.680 --> 3:02:14.000]  these other videos I think I know who third place is I'll announce it on
[3:02:14.000 --> 3:02:17.840]  Monday or during the weekend they'll be posted up on the site we're launching a
[3:02:17.840 --> 3:02:23.040]  new contest that will be up by tonight or tomorrow to expose the flu okay to
[3:02:23.040 --> 3:02:26.520]  expose the shots I've just got to get all that written up and done as well
[3:02:26.520 --> 3:02:31.800]  speaking of the posters let's go to Jeff and South Dakota Jeff quickly what
[3:02:31.800 --> 3:02:38.080]  happened to you yeah yes Alex and Bob I was in a broken bone Nebraska which is
[3:02:38.080 --> 3:02:41.720]  where my wife is also a nurse I went down to the local gun show I was gonna
[3:02:41.720 --> 3:02:47.120]  take a picture of this huge Obama poster that the local IT slash you know all in
[3:02:47.120 --> 3:02:51.080]  one-store guy had up there at the gun show the thing must have been eight by
[3:02:51.080 --> 3:02:54.960]  ten in the meantime I'm putting up my own posters and stuff outside of the
[3:02:54.960 --> 3:02:59.720]  Obama Joker poster and stuff and as soon as I went back in to do stuff I
[3:02:59.720 --> 3:03:03.440]  noticed my posters and stuff would get ripped down I know a couple gentlemen
[3:03:03.440 --> 3:03:06.720]  outside one look like a farmer another one looks just like a cowboy and it
[3:03:06.720 --> 3:03:10.520]  turned out to be the promoters they in the meantime went inside made Jim take
[3:03:10.520 --> 3:03:13.920]  down his big poster which I wanted to get for you Alex this would have been huge
[3:03:13.920 --> 3:03:17.920]  I mean they're nice poster for you I came back I said well what was up why are
[3:03:17.920 --> 3:03:21.280]  you taking the stuff down it's a walk you're afraid to be political because
[3:03:21.280 --> 3:03:25.760]  the mayor of the town here in broken bone Nebraska might kick us out of the
[3:03:25.760 --> 3:03:30.040]  municipal building and exactly that's how this tyranny works first they tell
[3:03:30.040 --> 3:03:33.480]  churches they can't now they're to and then everybody just in fact that's what
[3:03:33.480 --> 3:03:37.680]  the local paper in Austin and Hayes County says we can't allow any of this
[3:03:37.680 --> 3:03:43.000]  it's an American and soon that's the point no one has any free speech Bob
[3:03:43.000 --> 3:03:48.720]  Chapman this is exactly what we're talking about absolutely absolutely and
[3:03:48.720 --> 3:03:54.080]  you'd what you do is you tell them that a take a hike so so that's what I was
[3:03:54.080 --> 3:03:57.600]  saying and I what really made a man I said what's the walk as it then were
[3:03:57.600 --> 3:04:01.200]  your ancestors must have been Tories or something I said you know maybe they were
[3:04:01.200 --> 3:04:04.920]  fighting on the wrong side of the revolution and they started getting my
[3:04:04.920 --> 3:04:09.720]  face obviously my hands are full of stuff it just literally pushed and shoved me
[3:04:09.720 --> 3:04:13.000]  out the door you know these are supposed to be supposed to write when
[3:04:13.000 --> 3:04:17.280]  conservative people I said well you're no better shut me down than Obama or
[3:04:17.280 --> 3:04:21.520]  Clinton or Bush was they are their cowards they they literally worship
[3:04:21.520 --> 3:04:25.720]  licking boots and we better not let anybody put posters up they might come
[3:04:25.720 --> 3:04:31.560]  get us in America you know I mean they might as well live in Romania in 1965
[3:04:31.560 --> 3:04:36.800]  they might as well live in in Ukraine in 1935 I mean these people want to be
[3:04:36.800 --> 3:04:40.520]  raped they want to be enslaved it's disgusting keep it up Jeff get the

[3:08:07.120 --> 3:08:10.720]  as if that could happen I mean if you got 50 million more people in the system
[3:08:10.720 --> 3:08:13.840]  and a certain number of doctors people are gonna be in line you're gonna have
[3:08:13.840 --> 3:08:19.240]  to determine who gets the next treatment is unfairly the elderly are the ones who
[3:08:19.240 --> 3:08:22.240]  are gonna get short changed that's so true I mean in a way it's a form of
[3:08:22.240 --> 3:08:30.320]  eugenics and that's why we've got him on with us I continually hear him point
[3:08:30.320 --> 3:08:34.120]  out how they want to put troops on the streets have the inoculations martial

[3:09:09.920 --> 3:09:14.240]  mean I've gone over the sections all that bad stuff is in there or at points
[3:09:14.240 --> 3:09:18.480]  at boards that we know do carry out all this rationing we know what happens in
[3:09:18.480 --> 3:09:21.760]  Canada and England and Germany that's on record you can watch the House of
[3:09:21.760 --> 3:09:26.720]  Commons on c-span and see him admitting it I mean as a doctor give us your
[3:09:26.720 --> 3:09:30.760]  snapshot of this program where you see it going and why you're saying it
[3:09:30.760 --> 3:09:35.520]  borders on eugenics well I think that I think the big issue here is that it
[3:09:35.520 --> 3:09:39.080]  starts in the wrong place I'm getting more and more disturbed about it now
[3:09:39.080 --> 3:09:42.640]  that now that we're seeing you know these religious references and everyone
[3:09:42.640 --> 3:09:46.680]  that doesn't agree with President Obama is somehow bearing false witness I mean
[3:09:46.680 --> 3:09:52.480]  how awful is that I mean you know I think I think that the whole discussion
[3:09:52.480 --> 3:09:56.880]  is misguided first of all anybody understands in the United States that
[3:09:56.880 --> 3:10:00.200]  that that if we're going to change something we need a debate so it's
[3:10:00.200 --> 3:10:04.280]  very suspicious that if you disagree with the president of the
[3:10:04.280 --> 3:10:08.240]  administration somehow you're wrong I mean where's the debate that there's got
[3:10:08.240 --> 3:10:11.920]  to be something to discuss and what about practicing physicians who are in the
[3:10:11.920 --> 3:10:15.920]  trenches every day with patients and see where this is going and I'm not an
[3:10:15.920 --> 3:10:20.080]  insurance salesman I work with patients I have to deal with insurance public and
[3:10:20.080 --> 3:10:23.520]  private so why isn't the administration more interested in the fact that
[3:10:23.520 --> 3:10:27.320]  practicing physicians are having a problem with this we don't think the
[3:10:27.320 --> 3:10:31.640]  government insurance works that well we don't think that Medicaid works well at
[3:10:31.640 --> 3:10:35.240]  all we don't think Medicare is working very well well they're admitting doctor
[3:10:35.240 --> 3:10:39.920]  they can't even read the 1,300 page bill Conyers admits that I mean how can
[3:10:39.920 --> 3:10:44.320]  they implement something if they can't even read what was written by special
[3:10:44.320 --> 3:10:48.680]  interest a and then be going back and backing you up we have them all over the
[3:10:48.680 --> 3:10:53.120]  news now as a mantra saying you can't even call it socialism or you're a
[3:10:53.120 --> 3:10:59.000]  racist using the n-word they are weaponizing politics terrorizing the
[3:10:59.000 --> 3:11:03.440]  public and invoking racism they're actually the ones using race they're
[3:11:03.440 --> 3:11:10.640]  the ones that are engaging in racism race pimping really I think I think that
[3:11:10.640 --> 3:11:14.240]  we have to get back to basics here you know what are the basics the basics are
[3:11:14.240 --> 3:11:18.840]  whether they like it or not health care and health insurance are not the same
[3:11:18.840 --> 3:11:22.160]  thing I mean why Americans understand that that's one of the reasons we're
[3:11:22.160 --> 3:11:25.680]  having the problem we're having Americans understand that they own an
[3:11:25.680 --> 3:11:29.840]  automobile and they know if they bring their automobile in with a scratch their
[3:11:29.840 --> 3:11:33.400]  rates are going to go up and if they if they try to bring their automobile in
[3:11:33.400 --> 3:11:36.160]  with a scratch too much they're going to find out there are no repair shops
[3:11:36.160 --> 3:11:40.280]  around taking their insurance that's something we've lost sight of with
[3:11:40.280 --> 3:11:43.720]  health with health insurance health insurance is the problem it's not the
[3:11:43.720 --> 3:11:47.680]  solution and government run health insurance is absolutely the worst so
[3:11:47.680 --> 3:11:52.160]  it's completely disingenuous to have this discussion without looking at what
[3:11:52.160 --> 3:11:56.440]  real health needs health care needs are and one thing is and this is where I
[3:11:56.440 --> 3:11:59.920]  get very upset there's a great shortage of physicians in the United States
[3:11:59.920 --> 3:12:06.720]  there's an estimated 40,000 primary care physicians we're going to be lacking in
[3:12:06.720 --> 3:12:10.320]  the next 10 years and you can probably triple that given the fact that we have
[3:12:10.320 --> 3:12:14.800]  78 million baby boomers coming in then let's piss off physicians more let's
[3:12:14.800 --> 3:12:18.720]  cut them out don't worry we're not cutting benefits to patients we're only
[3:12:18.720 --> 3:12:23.040]  cutting benefits to the poor guy in a Medicaid clinic who's already doing
[3:12:23.040 --> 3:12:27.960]  cataract surgery for free and saw his reimbursements cut down from 1700 to 500
[3:12:27.960 --> 3:12:31.320]  and you know and has to file the paperwork with Medicaid before you get
[3:12:31.320 --> 3:12:34.680]  a penny can't even afford and he can't even I mean my dad's a physician he
[3:12:34.680 --> 3:12:39.120]  can't even then afford the medical malpractice insurance people aren't
[3:12:39.120 --> 3:12:43.040]  living in the real world that don't live and work as a physician like you do and
[3:12:43.040 --> 3:12:46.760]  I think you point out the whole debates of fraud back before we have medical
[3:12:46.760 --> 3:12:50.480]  insurance we even had you know better access to health care it becomes just
[3:12:50.480 --> 3:12:55.840]  this bigger and bigger fraud this bigger and bigger scam where the expenses of
[3:12:55.840 --> 3:12:59.520]  the bureaucracies go up and the media saying it's the doctors getting the
[3:12:59.520 --> 3:13:03.880]  money I see the statistics doctors in the last 20 years in many cases are
[3:13:03.880 --> 3:13:07.280]  making half of what they were people ask me all the time why aren't doctors
[3:13:07.280 --> 3:13:09.920]  fighting I'll give you a couple answers for that the number one you're not
[3:13:09.920 --> 3:13:13.560]  going to believe which is that too busy taking care of patients number two is
[3:13:13.560 --> 3:13:17.920]  they most doctors realize that they're being steamrolled and they don't feel
[3:13:17.920 --> 3:13:21.480]  that there's anything to do about it so why waste the time but they he's gonna
[3:13:21.480 --> 3:13:24.920]  there's gonna be a road awakening in a few years if this gets slammed down
[3:13:24.920 --> 3:13:29.640]  doctors are gonna revolt and I'll have to tell you full disclosure here's how
[3:13:29.640 --> 3:13:35.120]  doctors revolt they either drop out or they game the system now the patients
[3:13:35.120 --> 3:13:39.760]  want that you want to be game you want your doctor to drop out let's deal with
[3:13:39.760 --> 3:13:44.320]  with a real myth that you're gonna get to keep the doctor you got now till he
[3:13:44.320 --> 3:13:49.240]  quits you know great great great great quote get to keep the doctor you have
[3:13:49.240 --> 3:13:53.200]  now so you know physicians are being completely ignored in this whole
[3:13:53.200 --> 3:13:59.040]  discussion and a few of us have loud voices but but clearly the debate with
[3:13:59.040 --> 3:14:03.760]  it why what would you would you have a debate about about about who's
[3:14:03.760 --> 3:14:07.240]  operating your train without talking about the conductor would you say let's
[3:14:07.240 --> 3:14:11.080]  let's pad the seats let's get new dining cars by the way the engineers
[3:14:11.080 --> 3:14:15.240]  quitting who's driving the train well that's like that's like the government
[3:14:15.240 --> 3:14:19.120]  says they're gonna put screen doors on submarines without consulting the
[3:14:19.120 --> 3:14:24.240]  the engineer who designed the submarine but I mean it's totally the case and I
[3:14:24.240 --> 3:14:27.640]  don't want you listeners to think by the way that I only care about doctors but
[3:14:27.640 --> 3:14:31.000]  there's a trickle trickle down effect here because everybody knows that when
[3:14:31.000 --> 3:14:34.120]  you go to the doctor's office you're not meeting President Obama you're meeting
[3:14:34.120 --> 3:14:38.320]  your physician and it's not that I and by the way one more thing that I don't
[3:14:38.320 --> 3:14:41.280]  think I've ever said before I want to make a really really important point here
[3:14:41.280 --> 3:14:47.680]  you know doctors are not the same doctors that we were dealing with in 1964 when
[3:14:47.680 --> 3:14:52.200]  Medicare came down the pike those doctors were definitely living high on the
[3:14:52.200 --> 3:14:55.120]  hog and there was a lot of fat on the bone now I don't happen to think the
[3:14:55.120 --> 3:14:59.360]  fat was chipped off the bone in the right way I don't think HMOs work very
[3:14:59.360 --> 3:15:03.080]  well and I know that the government insurance doesn't but the doctors we
[3:15:03.080 --> 3:15:07.480]  have now are very close to the bone they have very very high overhead they're
[3:15:07.480 --> 3:15:10.720]  working their butts off they're seeing 40 patients a day what do you want to see
[3:15:10.720 --> 3:15:15.400]  60 I mean let's plug their offices with with millions of more patients and pay
[3:15:15.400 --> 3:15:19.600]  them less and hospitals we're gonna cut well I've seen it with nurses that's
[3:15:19.600 --> 3:15:23.400]  why they got such a shortage there it's a hellish job because they are
[3:15:23.400 --> 3:15:27.720]  overworking everybody and they use a few specialists on TV to demonize the
[3:15:27.720 --> 3:15:30.480]  profession in the five minutes we got left I want to plug your websites
[3:15:30.480 --> 3:15:34.600]  Dr. Siegel dot com that's Dr. Siegel dot com I wanted to specifically get into
[3:15:34.600 --> 3:15:39.280]  eugenics so you said it's almost like eugenics well the bioethicist boards have
[3:15:39.280 --> 3:15:43.640]  a lot of eugenicist ideas in them Europe as you know that they've said of
[3:15:43.640 --> 3:15:47.800]  your old you don't deserve the same care as a young person we know that
[3:15:47.800 --> 3:15:52.720]  Dashiell's book said if you're old you don't deserve the care so I can I mean
[3:15:52.720 --> 3:15:57.120]  can you elaborate as a as a well-known prominent position why you use the word
[3:15:57.120 --> 3:16:01.280]  eugenics because we're trained in medical school not to make any difference
[3:16:01.280 --> 3:16:05.000]  between one patient and another I've talked about that endlessly and thought
[3:16:05.000 --> 3:16:08.760]  about that I don't I don't treat you know overweight people differently than
[3:16:08.760 --> 3:16:12.880]  skinny people except that I might focus on being overweight as a problem I don't
[3:16:12.880 --> 3:16:17.540]  say this patient has no money I'm gonna treat them less I don't say this person's
[3:16:17.540 --> 3:16:21.280]  rich I'm gonna treat them better my patients wouldn't have it any other way
[3:16:21.280 --> 3:16:26.240]  so where's the government coming along saying you know things like Ezekiel
[3:16:26.240 --> 3:16:31.280]  manual is has written about life years too many life years I mean what is that
[3:16:31.280 --> 3:16:35.840]  all about why don't elderly deserve the same care as young people a patient is
[3:16:35.840 --> 3:16:40.080]  a patient is a patient that's the only way doctors can practice and it's the
[3:16:40.080 --> 3:16:43.960]  only way health care can be delivered and it's what the United States wants and
[3:16:43.960 --> 3:16:49.040]  they're they're phrasing it in the media and the government like it's good like
[3:16:49.040 --> 3:16:53.560]  you want the government taking tests away you want the government giving you a
[3:16:53.560 --> 3:16:58.180]  has a aspirin for a heart attack like Cuba I mean this is crazy well I don't
[3:16:58.180 --> 3:17:00.880]  think the government I think the biggest issue with the government by the way is
[3:17:00.880 --> 3:17:04.120]  that they don't have the qualification and that you never mind that they're
[3:17:04.120 --> 3:17:07.600]  that they do such a great job with the IRS and with the post office but they
[3:17:07.600 --> 3:17:10.720]  you know they're just learning their talking points now I mean they're going
[3:17:10.720 --> 3:17:15.040]  to seminars and tutorials on health care I mean you can't you know that's the
[3:17:15.040 --> 3:17:19.800]  thing that's most disturbing here of all I wouldn't you know I I watch politics
[3:17:19.800 --> 3:17:23.280]  with a John this guy to begin with but where these guys get off thinking they
[3:17:23.280 --> 3:17:27.280]  can be health care experts that's the biggest bearing of false witness here
[3:17:27.280 --> 3:17:31.600]  to begin with I mean when did it with this guy get an MD from you know we
[3:17:31.600 --> 3:17:35.920]  we're in this for I've been in this for two decades already and I'm not just a
[3:17:35.920 --> 3:17:38.880]  practicing position as you know I'm writing about this I've been writing
[3:17:38.880 --> 3:17:42.880]  about health policy for 10 years I studied this very carefully there's too
[3:17:42.880 --> 3:17:47.600]  many people in this dealing with this ramming this down our throats who are
[3:17:47.600 --> 3:17:51.120]  not qualified to be looking at health care and health reform but they are
[3:17:51.120 --> 3:17:54.480]  qualified to steal 20 percent of the country's economy that's not under
[3:17:54.480 --> 3:17:57.840]  government control so they can give it to their fat cat buddies is now coming
[3:17:57.840 --> 3:18:03.480]  out in closing the flu I've seen no US media I'd love for you to break this
[3:18:03.480 --> 3:18:07.880]  nationally you've got the power to do it the Sunday mail the London Telegraph
[3:18:07.880 --> 3:18:13.560]  German news reports swine flu jab link to killer nerve disease leaked letter
[3:18:13.560 --> 3:18:18.480]  reveals concern of neurologist over 25 deaths in America in the test alone of
[3:18:18.480 --> 3:18:24.760]  the vaccine by Gillian Bernays and other deaths of neurological it's
[3:18:24.760 --> 3:18:29.320]  switching on some autoimmune response massive brain swelling doctor your
[3:18:29.320 --> 3:18:34.600]  comments on this and the news saying three shots can mutate in the body well
[3:18:34.600 --> 3:18:39.680]  look look I think it's a mild virus I think that as you hinted before I came
[3:18:39.680 --> 3:18:42.120]  on we don't know how it's going to be hyped yet we don't know what the
[3:18:42.120 --> 3:18:45.760]  administration's going to do to hype it I think it's a mild virus but I do think
[3:18:45.760 --> 3:18:48.600]  it's made its way around the world and I think we have to pay particular
[3:18:48.600 --> 3:18:52.000]  attention to it I don't think we can ignore it but the hysteria is totally
[3:18:52.000 --> 3:18:56.240]  ridiculous I think we need a vaccine to it but the vaccine that is problematic
[3:18:56.240 --> 3:19:00.640]  because in 1976 we had a we had a we thought was a swine flu epidemic which
[3:19:00.640 --> 3:19:04.680]  was completely fabricated it turned out and we ended up with close to a thousand
[3:19:04.680 --> 3:19:09.760]  cases of ascending paralysis as a result that could happen again but I don't
[3:19:09.760 --> 3:19:13.000]  want to use fear of the vaccine to replace fear of the virus I don't like
[3:19:13.000 --> 3:19:17.480]  fear in general I've written books on this but the doctor we got 30 seconds my
[3:19:17.480 --> 3:19:23.760]  issue here is that is that internal CDC they're saying keep I mean oh were you
[3:19:23.760 --> 3:19:28.480]  aware of this it's not in our news I'm aware of it you are aware I'm aware of
[3:19:28.480 --> 3:19:32.200]  it but I don't but I don't know to the extent to which it's a problem versus
[3:19:32.200 --> 3:19:37.520]  76 in other words it remains to be seen how significant a side effect this is
[3:19:37.520 --> 3:19:41.960]  before I go and tell people be afraid of this vaccine I want to see more about
[3:19:41.960 --> 3:19:46.120]  what a risk this really is exactly but they're keeping it secret so shouldn't
[3:19:46.120 --> 3:19:49.000]  that be public shouldn't there be a big debate about this there should be a big
[3:19:49.000 --> 3:19:51.760]  debate about this but I'm telling you right now I'm always on the side of the
[3:19:51.760 --> 3:19:55.400]  facts and I want to close by saying I think the vaccine is going to be safe
[3:19:55.400 --> 3:20:01.640]  dr. seagull.com doc thanks for talking to us on my pleasure anytime you bet

[3:28:03.240 --> 3:28:07.760]  explain this is all fraud and the police told the young man that we know this is
[3:28:07.760 --> 3:28:14.480]  selective enforcement and that they don't normally go after people from this
[3:28:14.480 --> 3:28:18.280]  but it's political pressure and then Obama supporters were there snapping
[3:28:18.280 --> 3:28:22.040]  photos of people doing it and saying we're going to turn you in just like
[3:28:22.040 --> 3:28:28.280]  Obama told them to do on his own website so again this is a big big issue will
[3:28:28.280 --> 3:28:35.080]  have more for you on the abbreviated Sunday show as well in other news the
[3:28:35.080 --> 3:28:39.240]  dollar is plunging all the real economic numbers show commodities exploding
[3:28:39.240 --> 3:28:43.280]  because of dollar devaluation takes more dollars worldwide to buy those
[3:28:43.280 --> 3:28:49.360]  governments are moving away from the dollar unemployment skyrocketing every
[3:28:49.360 --> 3:28:53.200]  real economic indicator is we're dead meat meanwhile the media is telling you
[3:28:53.200 --> 3:28:56.720]  the economy is great because it is for the big bankers and the billionaires
[3:28:56.720 --> 3:29:00.560]  and the people that control trillions this is their big consolidation their
[3:29:00.560 --> 3:29:04.400]  vertical integration because we're armed they can't come in with a Soviet
[3:29:04.400 --> 3:29:08.600]  takeover right away so they can economically rape us and Obama's their
[3:29:08.600 --> 3:29:12.360]  front man to take the blame of that just like Bush was involved we have got to
[3:29:12.360 --> 3:29:15.800]  expose the offshore banks for stealing twenty three point seven trillion in the
[3:29:15.800 --> 3:29:21.560]  last ten months hoarding that money and paying banks not to loan to the citizens
[3:29:21.560 --> 3:29:26.280]  to kill the economy so the banks can force a consolidation they want a
[3:29:26.280 --> 3:29:31.960]  destroyed economy not your local bank the big multinational king banks want to
[3:29:31.960 --> 3:29:35.840]  destroy the economy so they can consolidate it and vertically integrate
[3:29:35.840 --> 3:29:39.960]  it want to say great job to the crew here as well before I run out of time

[3:33:48.280 --> 3:34:00.680]  let's get into the national socialist health care obama tried to stonewall
[3:34:00.680 --> 3:34:04.160]  people and said this is no big deal but people have now read the bill you're a
[3:34:04.160 --> 3:34:07.640]  medical doctor and a congressman can you tell us what's really in that bill
[3:34:07.640 --> 3:34:37.480]  well it is nationalized health care and it's a pretense that it isn't you know completely just means that if there's some transition involved so their goal is to have one party payer which means that they control everything and there's a lot of other bad things into like these like this effort to consult with anybody who's over a certain age and talk to them about end-of-life type of procedures this this bill is just such a
[3:34:37.480 --> 3:35:01.480]  national outrage the american people see it for what it is it's going to cost a lot of money their care is not going to be improved and that special interest will be served congressman when i was talking to you when we first got you under that one minute break you brought up the rebellion against really both parties
[3:35:01.480 --> 3:35:17.480]  democrats dogged being shouted down republican congressman delaware congressman specter getting chanted down people saying we don't want your socialist big government health care that has got to be exciting when their own constituents are shouting them down
[3:35:17.480 --> 3:35:35.480]  yeah i think and this is different i don't remember seeing the people so angry as they are now but i think what they've discovered is that government is a failure they've been it isn't so much that they're all saints now and they don't want the government taking care of them i think a lot of people have come to the realization that you can't trust government
[3:35:35.480 --> 3:35:53.480]  government has been promising me all this and they were going to give me all these free things and wouldn't cost anything and not have a good job and would have happily ever after they're starting to realize now that it's not so and they're going to end up with a lot of debt and the government can't be trusted that's a healthy start
[3:35:53.480 --> 3:36:03.480]  so it is our job now to fill in the void and tell them what the role of government ought to be so that we can take all this energy and anger and redirect it
[3:36:03.480 --> 3:36:19.480]  exactly because you have always said that the danger point is that when we come to this crisis the collapse of the government they're going to try to make it even bigger and a total tyranny we've got to be there beforehand and during saying no let's get back to the system that's proven to be the most
[3:36:19.480 --> 3:36:35.480]  bountiful the most free the beautiful system the great design our founders gave us up until now they've been able to use fear as their best tactic and whether it's on foreign policy issues or domestic policy issues that's how that first part went through
[3:36:35.480 --> 3:36:51.480]  you know the whole thing would be collapsing you know we have to do this rapidly don't ask any questions appropriate seven hundred billion dollars and we'll take care of everything so if things get worse they'll say boy this is more reason than ever for the government to take over and
[3:36:51.480 --> 3:37:01.480]  of course we still have the threat of martial law coming in because I think they haven't forgotten about that and I don't think that hesitate to use it
[3:37:01.480 --> 3:37:11.480]  congressman when we come back I want to talk about the establishment's response though to the majority of House members now wanting to audit the Fed and the people getting angry
[3:37:11.480 --> 3:37:23.480]  Lloyd dogged and others went on the news and said it was all staged all fake it didn't matter that I found out my neighbor was there and buying groceries at Randall's in south Austin where I live and went over and started chanting
[3:37:23.480 --> 3:37:35.480]  it didn't matter if one of my dad's employees at his dental office was there at the meeting a Democrat who was sent the letter and that she was mad at him it didn't matter that it was real he just says it's fake
[3:37:35.480 --> 3:37:43.480]  but everywhere people are saying no this is sounds like Marie Antoinette let them eat cake
[3:37:43.480 --> 3:37:59.480]  in fact they'll wake up soon and I think that this is not going to go away very quickly absolute we're going to come back and talk more about this there they are chanting and Lloyd dogged hundreds and hundreds of people literally chasing him from the building and he says it's staged
[3:37:59.480 --> 3:38:15.480]  well it's not staged we ended that segment with video and audio of congressman Lloyd dogged a big collectivist being being being booed off the stage in a Randall's grocery store here in Austin now I talk to people that were there
[3:38:15.480 --> 3:38:29.480]  they said we don't want this he said I don't care what you want I'm going to do it I saw him during the cap and trade say I don't care if I'm getting five to one calls against this I'm going to do it that seems to be his
[3:38:29.480 --> 3:38:39.480]  his call sign and then the media is acting like it's un-American and bad that citizens would dare chant at him is it un-American to go talk to your politicians
[3:38:39.480 --> 3:38:55.480]  well when we can't do that it's all over you know the first amendment tells you something about petitioning congress and having some redress so I would say that if they ever get to the point where they want to enforce that where you can't call down your elected officials
[3:38:55.480 --> 3:39:13.480]  the ballgame is over but right now I think there's still enough room you're still on the radio I still speak out I still am in congress so we have a vehicle the answer is going to be an can we awaken and alert enough people to become activists and rally the cry for
[3:39:13.480 --> 3:39:29.480]  freedom so the control freak status are in a race against time we're in a race against them where would you put our situation as humanity is an American people we see a huge awakening taking place is the momentum beginning to shift in our
[3:39:29.480 --> 3:39:47.480]  direction I don't think there's any doubt about it you know I keep thinking about what our history was like in the 20s in the 30s in the 20s in the 30s early 30s everything had already shifted intellectually but even when Roosevelt ran in 1932
[3:39:47.480 --> 3:40:03.480]  he ran on a conservative platform the gold standard and balance the budget and criticize Hoover for doing all the dumb things but the intellectual community had already come to the welfare state and socialism and that is of course is what Roosevelt responded to I think it may well be reversed right now
[3:40:03.480 --> 3:40:25.480]  because now when I go out and talk to colleges and campuses and kids they know what Austrian economics are and they know about the Federal Reserve I mean just think of the momentum we have on the Federal Reserve and the Fed so I would say underneath the momentum is on our side
[3:40:25.480 --> 3:40:43.480]  and Washington and the intellectual communities are still very status so this to me is very encouraging but we have to translate that eventually into political action but the contest is on and we have a long way to go yet
[3:40:43.480 --> 3:41:03.480]  Congressman what are the tricks up the sleeve of the establishment the people don't want socialized healthcare they don't want open borders they don't want new wars they don't want a private Federal Reserve that's above the law but the establishment seems instead of trying to give an olive branch seems to be entrenching themselves further
[3:41:03.480 --> 3:41:17.480]  I mean you're a well read person I'm sure you know Alabama's announcing they're going to use regular army as their new police force was connected to New York's asking for federal troops the Marines in California running DWI checkpoints CNN and Fox are reporting
[3:41:17.480 --> 3:41:26.480]  the army's going to lock down cities and try to carry out forced inoculations now they're trying to announce this I'm not saying they're going to get away with it but they're certainly saying it
[3:41:26.480 --> 3:41:42.480]  Marshall law was threatened against Congress last year they didn't give into the bankers clearly North com it appears is a receivership arm now for the offshore corporations that are trying to a sanguiate or absorb the United States your comments on the
[3:41:42.480 --> 3:42:00.480]  swine flu the hype the fear it's killed up less than 200 people in the U.S. and the regular flu kills 37,000 the CDC says but there's they're saying the end of Liberty the end of freedom forced inoculations because of a couple hundred dead is this an excuse for federal expansion of power
[3:42:00.480 --> 3:42:16.480]  yeah it's pure propaganda you know to get us involved overseas it's war propaganda on somebody's going to attack us with a nuclear weapon if we don't go in and invade other countries the same way are domestically scared people most people don't know what you just said that
[3:42:16.480 --> 3:42:32.480]  tens of thousands of people die from flu every year and now we have a couple hundred and they want us to just sacrifice our choices and just say okay if you if you tell us we need a shot we'll we'll do it but you know
[3:42:32.480 --> 3:42:46.480]  there will come a time when there will be enough of us it will just raise cane but the other thing is happening is the government's running out of money there's a limit you know they can have a lot of war propaganda but if they don't have any money and can't fight these wars the empire ends
[3:42:46.480 --> 3:43:02.480]  same way domestically that's why people should be prepared for bad times and survival reasons know how to take care of themselves know something about personal health care and there probably will always be an underground economy regardless of how bad it gets which means there will be
[3:43:02.480 --> 3:43:20.480]  you know even in the Soviet system you know the people who were in the know how and always ended up with a private doctor but this hope it never gets that bad that's the whole thing that's what we work so hard to try to prevent but when you hear these stories about the use of force and the use of
[3:43:20.480 --> 3:43:36.480]  martial law and and the tremendous invasion of our privacy that that to me is scary that nothing is private anymore everything in the government is secret in your privacy is non-existent that is where the real problem is we need to reverse that sentiment
[3:43:36.480 --> 3:43:52.480]  well congressman you are a medical doctor and I pulled up your quotes from the seventies when you came out and said we've had a few deaths at a military base that by the way was triggered after an inoculation and then thousands died
[3:43:52.480 --> 3:44:10.480]  tens of thousands got sick from the swine flu vaccine itself you were proven right then how did you know it was a fraud in seventy six seventy seven and I know you've spoken out against it today can you specifically give us your take on where it's going because it looks like
[3:44:10.480 --> 3:44:26.480]  from from from my research Obama is going to use fear over this flu as a political smokescreen and is kind of a false flag or control crises so government can grandstand as our savior to push through the carbon tax in the senate to push through the
[3:44:26.480 --> 3:44:40.480]  industry the gun control the socialized health care that's why you now see Pelosi and others saying we're going to try this in October I mean do you concur that that looks like how this is triangulating or give us your expert yeah it's it's hard to say but I think yes
[3:44:40.480 --> 3:45:00.480]  they'll definitely be some boats in September and October for them to bring bring this up but on the on the inoculations the way main reason why it was skeptical even in seventy six is unlike the mass treatment of people is just bad medicine that doesn't mean that I have an attitude inoculations are
[3:45:00.480 --> 3:45:18.480]  never good matter of fact I think only was truly eradicated by inoculations well small part but the question is should government be making massive decisions under the Constitution there's not supposed to be any government involvement at all so
[3:45:18.480 --> 3:45:32.480]  but government's inept I remember that vote in seventy six was interesting there were two of us that voted against it and the other one was Dr. Larry McDonald and I'm sure you remember that name but he and I were the only two and and we were I think there were three physicians in
[3:45:32.480 --> 3:45:42.480]  the Congress but the two of us as physicians voted against it believing it was bad medicine yeah I would ask you congressman please don't take any flights from Alaska to South Korea
[3:45:42.480 --> 3:45:52.480]  no I don't plan to do that well I think there'd be a revolt in this country if they did to you what they did to McDonald
[3:45:52.480 --> 3:46:02.480]  so we will continue the fight there is no doubt about that so but the momentum is on our side as you know people have warned me all about taking on the Federal Reserve
[3:46:02.480 --> 3:46:14.480]  but the momentum is building you know we worry about how much pressure they have and how much authority they have but because we've done our grassroots work
[3:46:14.480 --> 3:46:27.480]  we we've gotten the large majority of members of Congress to support our auditing bill and that didn't come from me persuading the congressman that came from exactly what's going on at these town hall meetings
[3:46:27.480 --> 3:46:37.480]  the people being upset in this way I think we harness the energy in the correct way and say look there's a problem there and one of the problems is they don't tell us what they're doing
[3:46:37.480 --> 3:46:48.480]  and here we have this secret organization that prints money spends the money outside the budget and people have responded and that's why we have this 282 members of Congress on it
[3:46:48.480 --> 3:47:02.480]  I suspect we're going to get more once we hit the 290 which means it will have two thirds vote or the 300 right in that area I think that's the time I'm going to really start putting pressure on the leadership to bring this up
[3:47:02.480 --> 3:47:13.480]  so far they're indicating that they'll bring the bill up you know in a mixture of other bills but they might get bogged down so I think after we go back there you may be hearing some announcements on
[3:47:13.480 --> 3:47:19.480]  where we want to direct our energies because we have such great momentum on that issue
[3:47:19.480 --> 3:47:31.480]  and then if the Senate tries to block it with a procedure that is going to be political suicide isn't it because I mean in polls over 75% of Americans want to audit or abolish the Fed
[3:47:31.480 --> 3:47:45.480]  that will only say what are you hiding why can't we look at what you're doing I mean did you see Bernacke well obviously you did sputtering and bumbling around on PBS in Kansas City about why no one can see the books I mean he looked like
[3:47:45.480 --> 3:48:01.480]  a cell vester caught with Tweety Bird feathers sticking out of his mouth and you know what I'm suspecting and we'll see if I'm right about this suspicion is I think eventually they're going to use national security as an excuse to keep the books closed
[3:48:01.480 --> 3:48:16.480]  you know a lot of times what the CIA does all they say all national security you're not allowed to know this we can't try this person national security because they do use funds to get involved in foreign affairs because they can make deals with other governments other central banks
[3:48:16.480 --> 3:48:25.480]  international financial organizations and that's the kind of stuff that they don't want us to know about so if there's some really big deals going in there they don't want us to know about it
[3:48:25.480 --> 3:48:32.480]  we'll see we'll see if they start talking about well there's some of this stuff you guys shouldn't know because that might undermine our national security
[3:48:32.480 --> 3:48:42.480]  okay congressman we've got about 12 minutes left I want to move quickly now through a whole host of questions for stations a network breaks coming up it's our break we're skipping it the network's not taking it
[3:48:42.480 --> 3:48:53.480]  congressman Ron Paul is our guest till 30 after congressman specifically on the economy they told us three years ago we weren't in a recession then two years later they admitted we'd been in one for over a year
[3:48:53.480 --> 3:49:08.480]  now they said a year ago green shoots now they're saying again the economy's wonderful we've turned the corner when every major indicator of joblessness and you name it is getting worse and worse anybody on main street knows we're in trouble
[3:49:08.480 --> 3:49:24.480]  maybe it's good for bankers getting billion dollar bonuses what do you as an economist as a doctor as a congressman what do you see happening what is the data you're seeing is this just more more political hype to stall the
[3:49:24.480 --> 3:49:40.480]  polling poll numbers of Barack Obama I think so and the one group that is doing quite well is that Goldman Sachs groups I mean their business is booming and their profits are booming and they've lived off the government but now I think you'll see a little
[3:49:40.480 --> 3:49:58.480]  lipstop word and maybe they announce on the news it's all propaganda well housing is doing so much better because it didn't go down quite as quickly as last month instead of losing 700,000 jobs last month we lost 500,000 jobs and you're supposed to feel good so it's a lot of propaganda
[3:49:58.480 --> 3:50:11.480]  they first want you to be very fearful and get you to go along with what they want to do and then they turn around and they want to convince you they're doing such a grand job and they'll tell you everything is wonderful but there's a limit to how long they can fool the people
[3:50:11.480 --> 3:50:31.480]  you know if you've been out of work and you don't have enough money to feed your kids and you listen to this you just don't buy into this stuff so I've always argued that the people are generally 10 to 15 years ahead of congress whether it has to do with foreign policy
[3:50:31.480 --> 3:50:51.480]  or the drug war or now even on some of these things that they're complaining about now and that's why these events are very important to get the attention of the members of congress because ultimately they like their job and if they know there's enough people out there they're going to pay attention and they'll change their voting

[3:52:01.480 --> 3:52:07.480]  in the new world order's war against humanity Barack Obama is the tip of the spear
[3:52:07.480 --> 3:52:15.480]  we've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded
[3:52:15.480 --> 3:52:21.480]  the Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people
[3:52:21.480 --> 3:52:26.480]  well Obama's already fudging, fudged since day one in this election
[3:52:26.480 --> 3:52:37.480]  if you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism
[3:52:37.480 --> 3:52:48.480]  it's not about left to right, it's about a one world government, this film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told and his real agenda

[3:52:56.480 --> 3:53:00.480]  the Obama deception, the people strike back
[3:53:00.480 --> 3:53:08.480]  did you know that there are tiny hidden radio transmitters also known as RFID chips in millions of passports, credit cards and licenses?
[3:53:08.480 --> 3:53:12.480]  in the current state of the economy it's no surprise that identity theft has increased
[3:53:12.480 --> 3:53:20.480]  with current technology thieves can purchase a simple device online that allows them to steal your credit card number and other personal information by scanning your wallet or purse
[3:53:20.480 --> 3:53:23.480]  think of this identity theft device as a garage door opener
[3:53:23.480 --> 3:53:26.480]  you push a button and within a certain distance your door opens
[3:53:26.480 --> 3:53:31.480]  thieves get near you, push a button and these tiny radios give out personal information
[3:53:31.480 --> 3:53:34.480]  put a stop to identity theft, visit idstronghold.com

[3:54:04.480 --> 3:54:12.480]  the issue here is if we arrest these people for their crimes that illustrates and breaks their back right there to put in a constitutional system
[3:54:12.480 --> 3:54:16.480]  so I'm just saying skip all the middle phases and go right to arresting the crooks
[3:54:16.480 --> 3:54:21.480]  well I don't quite have enough information to tell you who's going to get arrested
[3:54:21.480 --> 3:54:24.480]  or should be arrested and who's going to do the arresting you know
[3:54:24.480 --> 3:54:27.480]  your audit goes a long way towards beginning that process
[3:54:27.480 --> 3:54:31.480]  that is the purpose is to find out the information because I've argued that
[3:54:31.480 --> 3:54:36.480]  I don't talk about control of monetary policy, I don't talk about a new monetary system
[3:54:36.480 --> 3:54:41.480]  I'm talking about transparency and opening up the books and then going from there
[3:54:41.480 --> 3:54:46.480]  people are upset and angry and they know and if these books get open about the time we have prices going up
[3:54:46.480 --> 3:54:49.480]  that will be the inflation tax
[3:54:49.480 --> 3:54:56.480]  people you know they're getting hit but not as bad as if you have a CPI going up for 10, 15, 20%
[3:54:56.480 --> 3:55:01.480]  that's when the people are really going to be upset because they've lost a lot already
[3:55:01.480 --> 3:55:04.480]  people lost a lot in the value of their homes and their stocks
[3:55:04.480 --> 3:55:08.480]  but what happens if they lose the value of the purchasing power of their weekly paycheck
[3:55:08.480 --> 3:55:13.480]  or social security beneficiaries and that is going to be a big event
[3:55:13.480 --> 3:55:17.480]  that is something no matter what the government does they can't take care of it
[3:55:17.480 --> 3:55:22.480]  because the more they go into deficit financing once the psychology shifts
[3:55:22.480 --> 3:55:27.480]  it's amazing that we doubled the money supply and you didn't have a tremendous shift in psychology
[3:55:27.480 --> 3:55:30.480]  Gold holds its own and it does go up
[3:55:30.480 --> 3:55:33.480]  but there will be a point when the psychology shifts
[3:55:33.480 --> 3:55:37.480]  and they say well we need to help the elderly and the unemployed
[3:55:37.480 --> 3:55:42.480]  we're going to double their paycheck because they can't live on what they're getting
[3:55:42.480 --> 3:55:45.480]  that psychology then is going to be the panic
[3:55:45.480 --> 3:55:48.480]  and then the inflation will happen to your currency
[3:55:48.480 --> 3:55:52.480]  so it happens, it could happen overnight quickly now in the time we've got left
[3:55:52.480 --> 3:55:57.480]  a question, does Dr. Paul foresee a default on US debt, a bank holiday
[3:55:57.480 --> 3:56:03.480]  and a quick revaluation of the UDS much like happened in Argentina in early 2000
[3:56:03.480 --> 3:56:08.480]  and we see they're having to monetize quite a lot of the debt, the government buying its own debt
[3:56:08.480 --> 3:56:11.480]  I don't think it's going to be one of these things
[3:56:11.480 --> 3:56:14.480]  in the old days they had deliberate announcements and devaluations
[3:56:14.480 --> 3:56:17.480]  the dollar is being devalued every single day
[3:56:17.480 --> 3:56:23.480]  so that's going to happen but there will be a time when the psychology changes
[3:56:23.480 --> 3:56:27.480]  when it will turn into a route and that's what they can't control
[3:56:27.480 --> 3:56:31.480]  and of course if they're in the control of the government and the power and the army and everything else
[3:56:31.480 --> 3:56:33.480]  then they end up picking up all the pieces
[3:56:33.480 --> 3:56:36.480]  but I don't think there will be a bank holiday
[3:56:36.480 --> 3:56:42.480]  that would help cause the panic that people then would really run out of the currency
[3:56:42.480 --> 3:56:45.480]  so they're not going to close down the bank
[3:56:45.480 --> 3:56:47.480]  they're going to keep the presses running
[3:56:47.480 --> 3:56:50.480]  they don't default by not paying the bills
[3:56:50.480 --> 3:56:52.480]  they're always going to pay social security
[3:56:52.480 --> 3:56:55.480]  they default by inflating
[3:56:55.480 --> 3:56:59.480]  if they can inflate 50% they've just defaulted on half of the debt
[3:56:59.480 --> 3:57:03.480]  okay congressman, in the limited time
[3:57:03.480 --> 3:57:06.480]  more and more it looks to me like Obama's going to be a one-term president
[3:57:06.480 --> 3:57:09.480]  he's got a record drop in polls for a president
[3:57:09.480 --> 3:57:14.480]  seven months into office, your take on Obama's political fortunes
[3:57:14.480 --> 3:57:18.480]  he promised the moon, he's delivering none of it, what is he happening?
[3:57:18.480 --> 3:57:20.480]  I don't think he'll be reelected
[3:57:20.480 --> 3:57:24.480]  I think it's way too early to know that for sure
[3:57:24.480 --> 3:57:27.480]  but his circumstances are much more difficult
[3:57:27.480 --> 3:57:31.480]  I often thought about this early on whether he would be like Roosevelt
[3:57:31.480 --> 3:57:33.480]  and never get blamed for anything
[3:57:33.480 --> 3:57:36.480]  Roosevelt got more popular and kept getting reelected
[3:57:36.480 --> 3:57:39.480]  in spite of the fact that he really prolonged the depression
[3:57:39.480 --> 3:57:42.480]  I don't think he's following the Roosevelt pattern
[3:57:42.480 --> 3:57:44.480]  I think you're right on that
[3:57:44.480 --> 3:57:48.480]  I think Obama is going to receive some of the blame and rightfully so
[3:57:48.480 --> 3:57:51.480]  not that he created the monster
[3:57:51.480 --> 3:57:53.480]  the monster was there already
[3:57:53.480 --> 3:57:55.480]  but it certainly works for the same people
[3:57:55.480 --> 3:57:57.480]  in closing, we've got about 45 seconds
[3:57:57.480 --> 3:58:00.480]  Holdren's book calling for putting sterilence in the water
[3:58:00.480 --> 3:58:02.480]  having the CPS take all children at birth
[3:58:02.480 --> 3:58:05.480]  and just total scientific dictatorship
[3:58:05.480 --> 3:58:08.480]  does it concern you that the White House science czar
[3:58:08.480 --> 3:58:12.480]  wrote a textbook on how to carry out world government?
[3:58:12.480 --> 3:58:15.480]  Sure it does, but that stuff's been around
[3:58:15.480 --> 3:58:19.480]  I'm just glad people are bringing it to the surface
[3:58:19.480 --> 3:58:22.480]  Would you call for an investigation into Holdren
[3:58:22.480 --> 3:58:24.480]  for these ideas?
[3:58:24.480 --> 3:58:27.480]  I would call for an investigation of the whole government all the time
[3:58:27.480 --> 3:58:30.480]  because there's too much government, too secret
[3:58:30.480 --> 3:58:33.480]  so the more we find out about any of their shenanigans, the better
[3:58:33.480 --> 3:58:36.480]  Congressman Ron Paul, have a great recess, God bless you
[3:58:36.480 --> 3:58:37.480]  Very good, thanks
[3:58:37.480 --> 3:58:39.480]  Thank you so much, we'll be right back

[3:58:49.480 --> 3:58:54.480]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions
[3:58:54.480 --> 3:58:58.480]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm
[3:58:58.480 --> 3:59:00.480]  how much ammunition do you want?
[3:59:00.480 --> 3:59:02.480]  My answer would be all I can get
[3:59:02.480 --> 3:59:05.480]  in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones
[3:59:05.480 --> 3:59:07.480]  Food is your only ammunition
[3:59:07.480 --> 3:59:09.480]  How much do you want? When do you want it?
[3:59:09.480 --> 3:59:11.480]  Now or after the battle starts
[3:59:11.480 --> 3:59:12.480]  When will you need it?
[3:59:12.480 --> 3:59:14.480]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[3:59:14.480 --> 3:59:17.480]  Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick?
[3:59:17.480 --> 3:59:20.480]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself
[3:59:20.480 --> 3:59:22.480]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[3:59:22.480 --> 3:59:26.480]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply
[3:59:26.480 --> 3:59:30.480]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life
[3:59:30.480 --> 3:59:32.480]  How much will you need? We don't know
[3:59:32.480 --> 3:59:34.480]  How much do you want? All you can get
[3:59:34.480 --> 3:59:35.480]  I'm Alex Jones
[3:59:35.480 --> 3:59:38.480]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day
[3:59:38.480 --> 3:59:42.480]  Call 1-800-409-5633
