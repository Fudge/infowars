[00:00.000 --> 00:18.400]  live from the info wars dot com studios you're listening to the alex jones show
[00:18.400 --> 00:22.800]  well there's some good things happening and some bad things happening
[00:22.800 --> 00:29.200]  to us trump is making his move on the deep state this is gonna be dangerous though and
[00:29.200 --> 00:32.400]  the border has officially collapsed it's all coming up the first an important
[00:32.400 --> 00:37.600]  report by one of our reporters breaking down white guilt won't stop hate it will
[00:37.600 --> 00:42.200]  cause it here it is modern society is doing great damage to the next
[00:42.200 --> 00:47.080]  generation and those that will come after it not only are they damaging the
[00:47.080 --> 00:51.800]  next generation but they're creating a problem which they are now claiming to
[00:51.800 --> 00:56.800]  solve a problem that does not yet exist now you probably know that children
[00:56.800 --> 01:01.560]  these days are being damaged but it's likely not only in the way that you
[01:01.560 --> 01:07.520]  think you probably know the situation kids are taught to hate themselves white
[01:07.520 --> 01:11.680]  students are taught that they are naturally racist boys are taught that
[01:11.680 --> 01:18.160]  they innately oppress women natural born American citizens are taught that they
[01:18.160 --> 01:25.920]  owe something to immigrants specifically illegal immigrants above all they are
[01:25.920 --> 01:31.160]  taught that they are bad and that they are deserving of hate that they should
[01:31.160 --> 01:37.720]  hate themselves now it may be damaging to be taught to hate yourself indeed it
[01:37.720 --> 01:42.360]  is but that's only the surface level we need to look at what's happening and
[01:42.360 --> 01:48.880]  why it can happen Americans are notoriously compassionate we're
[01:48.880 --> 01:53.640]  compassionate because we are taught to be but it's not even that we are taught
[01:53.640 --> 01:58.200]  to be because that's not necessary we are compassionate because we are told
[01:58.200 --> 02:05.200]  that we are as a culture it's naturally accepted that we care for people that we
[02:05.200 --> 02:09.520]  want to help people whom we have wronged we want to help people that have been
[02:09.520 --> 02:14.040]  wronged by other people there's been no other nation in the history of the earth
[02:14.040 --> 02:19.080]  or any organization for that matter that has exerted the amount of force in
[02:19.080 --> 02:26.120]  favor of humanitarian efforts as America has and this is the very reason that
[02:26.120 --> 02:31.320]  self-hatred can take root we have been taught that if we do something wrong to
[02:31.320 --> 02:36.240]  someone then we owe them something we need to make amends we need to help them
[02:36.240 --> 02:41.280]  out if somebody is less fortunate than us we're taught that we owe something to
[02:41.280 --> 02:46.000]  them that we need to lift them up not because of some political ideology but
[02:46.000 --> 02:51.400]  because we should care about our neighbor and yes while we are no longer a
[02:51.400 --> 02:57.000]  Christian nation and while political parties and governments can never be
[02:57.000 --> 03:03.280]  themselves Christian it's no doubt that Christianity had an undeniable influence
[03:03.280 --> 03:09.760]  on the way that our culture operates but what happens when an entire generation
[03:09.760 --> 03:14.560]  is raised to think that they are hateful cold pragmatic people that are
[03:14.560 --> 03:19.920]  willing to do whatever it takes to get to the end that they want the elite want
[03:19.920 --> 03:23.800]  white straight Americans to believe that they are totally evil yet also
[03:23.800 --> 03:27.640]  continue to act in a compassionate manner they want them to continue to
[03:27.640 --> 03:33.000]  believe that they are evil while also acting in a way that evil people do
[03:33.000 --> 03:39.400]  not but that is not how it works for now we have people that have been taught
[03:39.400 --> 03:43.280]  that they are evil and because of their kind nature they will try to make amends
[03:43.280 --> 03:50.520]  but someday we will have a generation that has fully internalized hate and
[03:50.520 --> 03:56.900]  when they see the consequences of diversity and multiculturalism religious
[03:56.900 --> 04:01.760]  and ethnic pluralism they will not respond like compassionate people because
[04:01.760 --> 04:06.360]  they have been taught that they are not compassionate people they have been taught
[04:06.360 --> 04:11.000]  that at their very nature they are hateful cold and willing to do whatever
[04:11.000 --> 04:17.200]  it takes to solve a problem even at the expense of other human life when a group
[04:17.200 --> 04:23.240]  has fully internalized an identity centered around hate the results will
[04:23.240 --> 04:31.560]  not be kind because only compassionate people feel guilt this is Jake Lloyd
[04:31.560 --> 04:45.040]  reporting for news wars dot com it's April 26 2019 on this Friday edition I
[04:45.040 --> 04:49.200]  am loaded for there believe me this is one broadcast you do not want to miss
[04:49.200 --> 04:53.680]  whatever you do on the local radio station listening to or over the internet
[04:53.680 --> 05:00.240]  watching us right now spread the word about how other folks can tune in the
[05:00.240 --> 05:03.800]  globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the
[05:03.800 --> 05:07.360]  environment full of the bad halogens fluoride chlorine bromide you name it
[05:07.360 --> 05:13.200]  that it lowers IQ it literally dumps the population down and on our quest to
[05:13.200 --> 05:17.560]  bring our listeners and viewers the best idea in the world we've gone through two
[05:17.560 --> 05:22.480]  permutations first seaweed based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source
[05:22.480 --> 05:26.080]  and the globalist tried to block us getting a supply of it so we discovered
[05:26.080 --> 05:30.440]  deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you x2 that's been
[05:30.440 --> 05:34.880]  incredible now due to the establishment trying to block that we did more research
[05:34.880 --> 05:40.040]  and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine but chemist
[05:40.040 --> 05:43.520]  scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it with three
[05:43.520 --> 05:49.360]  other compounds two forms of iodine and vitamin C it supercharges it and makes
[05:49.360 --> 05:54.520]  it even more bio available ladies and gentlemen you want to research it you
[05:54.520 --> 05:59.000]  want to see it it's an incredible discovery x3 now available at m4's
[05:59.000 --> 06:09.840]  live comm we are transferring power from Washington DC and giving it back to you
[06:09.840 --> 06:24.320]  the people Americanism not globalism will be our credo yes I have thought an
[06:24.320 --> 06:30.000]  awful lot about growing up the White House huge nationwide protests erupted
[06:30.000 --> 06:40.240]  once again on president Donald Trump's second weekend in office when you open
[06:40.240 --> 06:47.440]  your heart to patriotism there is no room for prejudice when America is united
[06:47.440 --> 07:00.120]  America is totally unstoppable most importantly we will be protected by God
[07:00.120 --> 07:06.600]  from the front lines of the info it's Alex Jones the front lines of the
[07:06.600 --> 07:15.000]  information war it's Alex Jones think about the synchronicity the
[07:15.000 --> 07:22.800]  serendipity that I only decided to go to DC a week ago I fly in I've been
[07:22.800 --> 07:27.600]  planning to bullhorn the White House on Wednesday but I felt a disturbance in
[07:27.600 --> 07:34.120]  the force and I said we must go to the White House now and we've checked the
[07:34.120 --> 07:42.240]  times I was there for 45 minutes I was bullhorning while Jack Dorsey came in
[07:42.240 --> 07:45.720]  and spoke for the entire meeting with the president and the president could
[07:45.720 --> 07:49.560]  hear it there's other folks that not I use bullhorns properly that are out
[07:49.560 --> 07:58.480]  there I'll give lessons I'm not joking and then of course Fox News covered a
[07:58.480 --> 08:02.080]  bunch of others covered the fact that I was pointing out that Jack Dorsey
[08:02.080 --> 08:06.640]  specifically had lied to Congress when he said they don't censor they then
[08:06.640 --> 08:11.440]  thought and the president I'm told thought that Jones had inside sources on
[08:11.440 --> 08:16.200]  the meeting that only a few people knew about I didn't I did not have inside
[08:16.200 --> 08:21.280]  sources it just keeps happening over and over again that on the same day at the
[08:21.280 --> 08:25.120]  same time Trump and I will say the same thing and that's been noticed it's been
[08:25.120 --> 08:30.160]  picked up I did a live broadcast about an hour before Trump's inauguration in
[08:30.160 --> 08:34.080]  2017 and I laid out what his speech would be about even though no one had
[08:34.080 --> 08:37.640]  leaked it and that was exactly that speech that Providence was coming back
[08:37.640 --> 08:42.320]  into America that Trump would invoke God and invite God back into America that
[08:42.320 --> 08:45.320]  Trump would make the announcement that the secret technologies would be
[08:45.320 --> 08:49.360]  deployed to the people it all happened and I just knew he was gonna do it
[08:49.360 --> 08:54.000]  there's some weird stuff going on here folks now most the time I go off research
[08:54.000 --> 08:59.360]  and documentation but when Spidey since goes off I tell people it's a gut we're
[08:59.360 --> 09:04.000]  gonna see what's gonna happen it's my nose and it ends up happening every time
[09:04.000 --> 09:09.400]  there's a lot of things going on this universe ladies and gentlemen and
[09:09.400 --> 09:13.120]  everybody has a sixth sense that God gave us it's just that if you ignore it
[09:13.120 --> 09:18.040]  your your heart hardens your soul hardens as the Bible says and it stops
[09:18.040 --> 09:22.960]  working you become delusional you're turned over to great delusion as the
[09:22.960 --> 09:29.280]  Bible says but if you go with it it becomes stronger and more powerful now
[09:29.280 --> 09:35.000]  this is gonna be another incredible broadcast today let me tell you I'm
[09:35.000 --> 09:39.000]  tempted here to just go ahead and cancel guess we had coming up today because
[09:39.000 --> 09:41.440]  I want to be able to clear the decks in fact we're gonna do that we're gonna
[09:41.440 --> 09:45.960]  cancel everybody but dr. Nick baggage who's hosting the fourth hour because
[09:45.960 --> 09:50.960]  we're going to drill directly into this cornucopia that I'm about to go over
[09:50.960 --> 09:57.360]  here first off tomorrow's news today next year's news today you isn't hardcore
[09:57.360 --> 10:01.520]  focused audience that are the tip of the spear in this country and the world are
[10:01.520 --> 10:07.200]  gonna say we've heard this 5,000 times we know it's true I know but it's really
[10:07.200 --> 10:12.320]  happening Trump has caught them more documents came out yesterday of
[10:12.320 --> 10:17.920]  Strock and Page after Trump was in the White House trying to manipulate their
[10:17.920 --> 10:23.520]  moles inside the White House you've now got Samantha Powers and the rest of them
[10:23.520 --> 10:28.680]  coming out and saying oh other people might have jumped into our computers and
[10:28.680 --> 10:34.200]  you know given the authorization for unmasking via the NSA you've got
[10:34.200 --> 10:39.440]  Clapper and Brennan on TV running around saying that oh we were under orders of
[10:39.440 --> 10:45.080]  Obama so we can't go to jail they're saying all of that because they know
[10:45.080 --> 10:48.560]  they've committed major crimes and they know Trump is not business as usual and
[10:48.560 --> 10:53.200]  that they're about to get their asses prosecuted this is real this is
[10:53.200 --> 11:00.720]  happening this is going down ladies and gentlemen and so get ready for major
[11:00.720 --> 11:04.920]  fireworks we're gonna be going over all of it and I don't normally air large
[11:04.920 --> 11:08.960]  segments of someone else's show but when it's newsworthy and a public service
[11:08.960 --> 11:14.480]  announcement it's the president I do we're gonna air probably 20 minutes of
[11:14.480 --> 11:19.640]  Sean Hannity this hour and then I'm tempted to come into Mara and do a whole
[11:19.640 --> 11:23.880]  two-hour special with the 45 minutes of that the president was on with Sean
[11:23.880 --> 11:28.200]  last night because it was historic Trump went right down the line of what
[11:28.200 --> 11:31.640]  he's going to do what they've been caught doing and now we're gonna slit the
[11:31.640 --> 11:35.680]  throat of the deep state once and for all and it's exactly what I told you was
[11:35.680 --> 11:41.760]  coming I told you yesterday but I talked to not one not two but three people
[11:41.760 --> 11:50.160]  who had talked to the president two of them in person last week when I was in
[11:50.160 --> 11:55.280]  DC I gotta spend more time in DC man it's just amazing the contacts we've got
[11:55.280 --> 11:58.440]  how we can just walk into any of these offices any of these facilities and talk
[11:58.440 --> 12:02.440]  to folks and they just give us the intel and I was told go ahead and release who
[12:02.440 --> 12:09.680]  told me this but I'm not gonna do it just to leave it at that but one
[12:09.680 --> 12:15.580]  obviously was a journalist another was someone falsely accused of the
[12:15.580 --> 12:20.480]  russia gate garbage you met with the president and I'm not gonna get into the
[12:20.480 --> 12:25.080]  other one was but they said Trump is going after them and he went on Hannity
[12:25.080 --> 12:32.760]  and said it last night so this is a big deal this is a really big deal and if
[12:32.760 --> 12:36.880]  you're not getting chills I'm getting them right now the opportunity to route
[12:36.880 --> 12:40.120]  the globalist and really get a fresh start is so good for our all of our
[12:40.120 --> 12:45.160]  children not to share but worldwide but the danger of how the globalists are

[23:32.960 --> 23:40.840]  Washington DC and returning it to the American people where it belongs this is
[23:40.840 --> 23:47.720]  like the inauguration where he kept the promises with all of the resignations
[23:47.720 --> 23:53.320]  of bad apples they're bad apples they tried for a coup didn't work out so

[24:46.400 --> 24:51.240]  stuff they've done to me be worse but it's called what we all together have
[24:51.240 --> 24:59.640]  done started two and a half years ago on that great November 8th I was a great
[24:59.640 --> 25:07.440]  day remember that day and then a year and a half we have one called November 3rd
[25:07.440 --> 25:14.320]  it's November 3rd this time get ready to vote you better you better get ready to
[25:14.320 --> 25:22.640]  vote but it's all called draining the swamp and we are doing it faster than
[25:22.640 --> 25:29.760]  anyone ever thought see folks I know he's doing he's he's saying I delivered
[25:29.760 --> 25:34.880]  two years ago and now the fight's about to start America is respected again
[25:34.880 --> 25:43.000]  because we are finally putting America first in a long time he's declaring war
[25:43.000 --> 25:49.640]  on the deep state right now the hottest anywhere on the planet earth just this
[25:49.640 --> 26:00.280]  morning we learned that the GDP smashed expectations with the economy growing at
[26:00.280 --> 26:08.200]  an annual rate of 3.2% in the first quarter always the worst quarter for
[26:08.200 --> 26:16.520]  whatever reason fellow reserves that's slapped around got back in line and if
[26:16.520 --> 26:25.120]  we kept the same interest rates and the same quantitative easing 5% that's a
[26:25.120 --> 26:32.480]  previous administration had that 3.2 would have been much higher than that
[26:32.480 --> 26:41.080]  but they hadn't hit these numbers in 16 years and 5% we had a tremendous
[26:41.080 --> 26:46.720]  increase in inventory investment you know what that means hearing up and
[26:46.720 --> 26:52.880]  listen to this a very big increase in net exports isn't it about time isn't
[26:52.880 --> 27:01.240]  that nice we've added almost six million jobs since my election and if I would
[27:01.240 --> 27:07.160]  have said that during the campaign all of those people back there we call them
[27:07.160 --> 27:11.520]  the fake news they wouldn't have believed they're fake and they're all
[27:11.520 --> 27:16.720]  plunging in the ratings even further we're winning they're losing so lie and
[27:16.720 --> 27:21.520]  attack all you want libtards we're beating you the fastest rate in more
[27:21.520 --> 27:28.800]  than three decades nearly five million Americans have been lifted off of food
[27:28.800 --> 27:39.680]  stamps since our election wages are rising fast and the lowest paid workers
[27:39.680 --> 27:46.040]  are making the biggest percentage gains of all and that's nice to hear it's
[27:46.040 --> 27:50.160]  about time all right we got to go to break this is live but we're gonna be
[27:50.160 --> 27:53.520]  able to back it up and later in the second hour I'm gonna go to the rest of
[27:53.520 --> 27:57.880]  it but we need to get on the real war they're gonna put out fake polls like
[27:57.880 --> 28:01.880]  that in 2016 to make it look like Trump's gonna lose and to make it look
[28:01.880 --> 28:06.520]  like he's unpopular they're doing it like I predicted new dogs old tricks
[28:06.520 --> 28:11.480]  old dogs new tricks same thing new lies for old same people same fraud same
[28:11.480 --> 28:16.880]  scams that's all coming up how they're gonna strike back how they're trying to
[28:16.880 --> 28:20.240]  undermine the economy but Trump is fighting back they've never experienced
[28:20.240 --> 28:26.320]  this that's why they're losing on every front but it's still been nipping top and
[28:26.320 --> 28:29.840]  I'll say it again you're the reason Trump got elected he just said that and

[33:33.920 --> 33:39.240]  president trump is live at the NRA we have live feeds up on info wars.com if
[33:39.240 --> 33:43.200]  you want to see that we're playing more of it in the next hour but I want to get
[33:43.200 --> 33:48.680]  to the historic interview he gave for the entire hour of Sean Hannity last night
[33:48.680 --> 33:53.840]  we're gonna hear about 20 minutes of it the full video is up on info wars.com
[33:53.840 --> 34:00.440]  and news wars.com titled attempted coup president trump gives extensive
[34:00.440 --> 34:05.000]  interview to Sean Hannity now why is this so important they covered the water
[34:05.000 --> 34:10.000]  front but the first 15 minutes or so he gets into the deep state the attempted
[34:10.000 --> 34:13.440]  coup and the counter strikes that are planned and the fact that they are
[34:13.440 --> 34:19.480]  pushing for indictments and they have all the evidence but I know they have the
[34:19.480 --> 34:24.320]  evidence because I was there researching and watching it all in the last three
[34:24.320 --> 34:29.920]  years we were the first show to say they were illegally spying on Trump we then
[34:29.920 --> 34:36.680]  received NSA documents via the drug enforcement agency exclusively that's
[34:36.680 --> 34:42.840]  WikiLeaks level stuff folks protected by law journalism where Trump and myself
[34:42.840 --> 34:46.720]  were being spied on by Obama right after he got into office our private
[34:46.720 --> 34:51.480]  numbers everything we were saying doing we were given that the index code that
[34:51.480 --> 34:55.720]  broke that zero attention other than deep state demanding I be taken off air
[34:55.720 --> 35:01.480]  and imagine how panicked they got as as we knew exactly what they were doing and
[35:01.480 --> 35:05.800]  how they were doing it but a lot of it was because
[35:06.640 --> 35:10.640]  Samantha Powers and others talked to the press and told them don't worry we know
[35:10.640 --> 35:14.120]  Trump's a Russian agent we've been surveilling him and then they reported
[35:14.120 --> 35:20.400]  that on CNN MSNBC and the New York Times I played those clips yesterday one
[35:20.400 --> 35:23.120]  American news was actually able to dig them out I couldn't find them I just
[35:23.120 --> 35:27.680]  remember it and remember the New York Times article about Trump Tower wiretapped
[35:27.680 --> 35:34.400]  we know he's a Russian on inauguration day they put that out that that lie that
[35:34.400 --> 35:38.040]  he was a Russian agent the truth was they were surveilling him then they
[35:38.040 --> 35:42.560]  tried to walk it back and tried to claim that I'd made it up but Trump covered
[35:42.560 --> 35:48.440]  this first and foremost with Hannity but again he says well I'm going from memory
[35:48.440 --> 35:54.160]  I guess it was a hunch no mr. President I've never really revealed this on air
[35:54.160 --> 35:58.440]  but in my first five or six conversations with the president until one
[35:58.440 --> 36:03.080]  time he got irritated with it and just said let me just talk to your wife and
[36:03.080 --> 36:07.520]  wish you a happy wedding I said sir you've got to go after them they are not
[36:07.520 --> 36:11.800]  going to stop coming after you they have in beds stay behind networks inside the
[36:11.800 --> 36:16.000]  government they have set up a Ministry of Truth with Defense Department money to
[36:16.000 --> 36:19.600]  target all the independent press and to shut us down they are working against you
[36:19.600 --> 36:23.560]  they have moles he'd say one moment Alex one moment he come back and goes keep
[36:23.560 --> 36:27.880]  going keep going this is he Trump will try to call up and pat me on the head the
[36:27.880 --> 36:31.760]  last time I talked to him I said mr. President I don't need you to call up
[36:31.760 --> 36:37.000]  and thank me okay I need you to defend yourself and I need you to understand
[36:37.000 --> 36:40.560]  this is going on now I know for a fact Hannity started telling him this a year
[36:40.560 --> 36:45.240]  and a half ago to the point of six months ago Trump was mad at Hannity now
[36:45.240 --> 36:49.720]  they're back levied up but I'm not bragging here I need you to understand
[36:49.720 --> 36:54.040]  that I don't candy-ass around with the president when I got on the telephone
[36:54.040 --> 36:58.880]  with him okay I'm not asking for jobs or I'm not asking for myself to even be
[36:58.880 --> 37:03.280]  protected I am simply telling the president protect yourself and don't
[37:03.280 --> 37:07.000]  believe these moles around you you're being lied to now it's all come out
[37:07.000 --> 37:11.880]  because I know what I'm talking about and I have the sources this is why they
[37:11.880 --> 37:15.040]  want me on fair so you're about to see Trump talk about who was first to
[37:15.040 --> 37:19.420]  warn him he was being spied on but first here CNN attacking me for it back in
[37:19.420 --> 37:25.660]  early 2017 and then after his tweet storm info wars then started saying well
[37:25.660 --> 37:29.040]  look it was the New York Times that reported it citing our story misreading
[37:29.040 --> 37:32.880]  our story and now a few weeks later the White House and the president are
[37:32.880 --> 37:38.200]  citing info wars so they've got one kind of bizarre right wing fringe theory to
[37:38.200 --> 37:41.480]  defend another bizarre right wing fringe theory both of which there's no
[37:41.480 --> 37:45.560]  evidence to support and just to be clear there is and correct me if I'm wrong
[37:45.560 --> 37:48.800]  there's absolutely nothing whatsoever in your reporting in the New York Times
[37:48.800 --> 37:53.360]  that indicates president Obama wiretapped or ordered wiretapping of
[37:53.360 --> 37:57.360]  then candidate Trump correct nothing I mean if we knew that that is a
[37:57.360 --> 38:01.120]  fantastic story that we would be rushing I would not be sitting here with you I'd
[38:01.120 --> 38:08.280]  be at home right oh sure right hoarding it ball face line so that's why info wars
[38:08.280 --> 38:10.520]  has been targeted it's probably been put through hell it's what they're trying to
[38:10.520 --> 38:15.280]  destroy us is because we have been loyal Americans and told the truth and the
[38:15.280 --> 38:18.360]  last time I talked to the president I said I think you figured out you have to
[38:18.360 --> 38:22.960]  go after him and I think you figured out they're never gonna back down and he
[38:22.960 --> 38:29.400]  said no I think you're right I think you're right and I said sir it's because
[38:29.400 --> 38:32.360]  you're better than them you're self-made they're from the political class
[38:32.360 --> 38:37.320]  they're all dishonorable they're all too faced you just have to understand you're
[38:37.320 --> 38:41.480]  not dealing in real estate anymore he goes I know I know Alex will keep it up
[38:41.480 --> 38:45.480]  we'll be talking a lot more soon I don't care about being patted on the head I
[38:45.480 --> 38:50.400]  said mr. president you don't need to call me anymore all you do is have your
[38:50.400 --> 38:53.720]  people watch my show and listen to my show but I do an emergency message to
[38:53.720 --> 38:59.360]  you and I need you to watch him he said he will and he does why do you want to
[38:59.360 --> 39:05.000]  get rid of certain people in the White House certain people like Miller and
[39:05.000 --> 39:10.240]  others and so that's why we're so targeted because the president listens
[39:10.240 --> 39:13.520]  to us and he knows we've told him basically everything before anybody else
[39:13.520 --> 39:25.520]  did I mean I told him not to trust Kelly and I told him not to trust Mattis and
[39:25.520 --> 39:30.800]  man I got threatened over that and they obviously have my phones tapped as they
[39:30.800 --> 39:33.960]  have this one high-level CIA guy I call up and it's very getting really
[39:33.960 --> 39:37.160]  threatening and I go I haven't done anything goes you do you know what
[39:37.160 --> 39:41.640]  you've done getting rid of our command and control up there so he can be out of
[39:41.640 --> 39:47.880]  control hey he got elected not you and I've never been commissioned to be in
[39:47.880 --> 39:51.840]  the military but the president told me keep it up press the attack don't stop
[39:51.840 --> 39:55.720]  well you know what as long as he doesn't stop I won't stop it doesn't mean he's
[39:55.720 --> 39:58.720]  got to be perfect doesn't mean he has to have all the answers but as long as he
[39:58.720 --> 40:02.160]  is an American president and tries to the best interest of the country I'm gonna
[40:02.160 --> 40:05.480]  back into the hill no matter how many threats or how much garbage or what goes
[40:05.480 --> 40:10.320]  on and it feels so good and satisfying to go through all this hell and then to
[40:10.320 --> 40:14.400]  see the back being broken of the globalist can you hear it because their
[40:14.400 --> 40:20.840]  backs breaking right now we're busting their guts open right now and it makes
[40:20.840 --> 40:27.000]  it really sweet to see victory coming into view and to see the enemy
[40:27.000 --> 40:29.920]  bleeding out politically after what we've gone through what you've gone
[40:29.920 --> 40:35.600]  through and so good job listeners you're in the arena when you spread the word
[40:35.600 --> 40:40.000]  about this broadcast when you financially support us and when you pray for us you
[40:40.000 --> 40:45.240]  are the man and the woman in the arena and I salute you and I salute the
[40:45.240 --> 40:49.560]  president let's go ahead and go to the start of this and I'm gonna air into the
[40:49.560 --> 40:52.480]  next hour but it's very very important full interviews up on m4s.com here's
[40:52.480 --> 40:56.200]  Sean Hannity introducing the president last night all right a lot of breaking
[40:56.200 --> 41:01.000]  news tonight and you haven't really talked at length in an interview about a
[41:01.000 --> 41:04.560]  lot of issues let me start with this issue of the Ukraine I don't know if
[41:04.560 --> 41:09.400]  you're following the top of the show or John Solomon's new report or that both
[41:09.400 --> 41:13.920]  Catherine Harage and Sarah Carter are reporting tonight we now have text
[41:13.920 --> 41:18.720]  messages from Peter Struck and Lisa Page never before seen discussing
[41:18.720 --> 41:24.400]  recruiting White House sources to spy on you take it in any order you'd like
[41:24.400 --> 41:29.560]  well I think it's incredible when you hear it these are great reporters all
[41:29.560 --> 41:34.600]  three and when you have them on your trail that's a problem these are people
[41:34.600 --> 41:37.800]  that should be getting Pulitzer's not the ones that got the Pulitzer's they
[41:37.800 --> 41:41.080]  got everything wrong if you listen to them they got everything wrong go back
[41:41.080 --> 41:45.680]  and read some of their early and mid articles they didn't have a clue what
[41:45.680 --> 41:48.920]  was going on and they went Pulitzer prize is D go ahead pause it should be
[41:48.920 --> 41:52.200]  winning the woman won the Pulitzer prize for reporting on Trump is the same
[41:52.200 --> 41:56.840]  pig that has other reporters stalking me and writing fake articles about me
[41:56.840 --> 42:01.800]  she's a dumb pig she can hardly talk let's go back to the president it sounds
[42:01.800 --> 42:06.240]  like big stuff it sounds like very interesting with Ukraine it was again
[42:06.240 --> 42:09.920]  to the new I love how Trump acts like oh I think this is gonna be coming out I
[42:09.920 --> 42:13.720]  think that's gonna be coming on he has it all all the cards all the crimes it's
[42:13.720 --> 42:18.320]  much worse than you've been told continue president a little while ago two
[42:18.320 --> 42:23.560]  days ago and congratulated him on a credible race incredible run a big
[42:23.560 --> 42:30.640]  surprise victory got 75% of the vote but that sounds like big big stuff I'm not

[47:37.640 --> 47:40.760]  friends with Eric and we had our combative interview in here about a
[47:40.760 --> 47:44.720]  year ago but I did a big instance of interview with him in DC we're gonna

[47:57.200 --> 48:00.400]  good interviews I don't normally air the interviews I put you know just on the

[48:08.720 --> 48:14.320]  hour as well but let's without me talking anymore let's start getting into
[48:14.320 --> 48:19.200]  the first 20 minutes of Trump on Sean Hannity last night where he lays out
[48:19.200 --> 48:22.800]  what's about to come down and what's happened and now we have more text
[48:22.800 --> 48:27.120]  messages of struck and page talking about moles inside the White House of course
[48:27.120 --> 48:30.360]  they testified to Congress that they've not had not done that so that they've
[48:30.360 --> 48:33.720]  been caught red-handed of course they were following orders of the Clinton
[48:33.720 --> 48:39.080]  East is and Obama so here's the president with Hannity last night Mr.
[48:39.080 --> 48:44.040]  president the Ukraine is offering this evidence to the United States would would
[48:44.040 --> 48:49.520]  you like the United States with all this talk about collusion they're saying
[48:49.520 --> 48:54.960]  they colluded on behalf of Hillary Clinton's campaign in 2016 does America
[48:54.960 --> 48:59.320]  need to see that information especially light of all that the attacks against you
[48:59.320 --> 49:04.800]  on collusion well I think we do and frankly we have a great new attorney
[49:04.800 --> 49:10.040]  general who's done an unbelievable job at a very short period of time and he's
[49:10.040 --> 49:14.160]  very smart and he's very tough and I would certainly defer to him but I would
[49:14.160 --> 49:19.400]  imagine he'd want to see this so people have been saying this this whole the
[49:19.400 --> 49:23.040]  concept of Ukraine they've been talking about it actually for a long time you
[49:23.040 --> 49:28.440]  know that and I would certainly defer to the attorney general and we'll see what
[49:28.440 --> 49:32.840]  he says about it he calls them straight that's one thing I can tell you Mr.
[49:32.840 --> 49:36.920]  president but our own Catherine Harage investigated reporter Sarah Carter big
[49:36.920 --> 49:42.040]  breaking news tonight Senate Republican chairman submitted a letter Thursday to
[49:42.040 --> 49:46.800]  the Department of Justice the Attorney General we have new texts from November
[49:46.800 --> 49:53.000]  of 2016 from struck and paid showing the pair had discussed attempts to recruit
[49:53.000 --> 49:58.360]  sources from within your White House to spy on your administration and reveal
[49:58.360 --> 50:03.040]  that they had one particular contact within the White House the vice
[50:03.040 --> 50:07.160]  president's chief of staff whose wife was working as an analyst for struck on the
[50:07.160 --> 50:11.680]  FBI investigation into Hillary's private server have you heard this report
[50:11.680 --> 50:17.000]  tonight sir I just heard it a little while ago and frankly it's very
[50:17.000 --> 50:21.840]  disconcerting if you if you look at what's been happening they were the same
[50:21.840 --> 50:28.320]  to the two lovers that decided to use the FBI server instead of their private so
[50:28.320 --> 50:33.120]  they didn't get caught these two were these two were beauties there's no doubt
[50:33.120 --> 50:37.600]  about it they were going hog while to find something about the administration
[50:37.600 --> 50:41.560]  which obviously wasn't there we have nothing to do with the Russia except that
[50:41.560 --> 50:46.320]  we've been tougher on Russia than any administration in 50 years a lot tougher
[50:46.320 --> 50:51.800]  than Obama but these were the two that talked about the insurance policy just
[50:51.800 --> 50:56.840]  in case Hillary Clinton loses if she loses we've got an insurance policy well
[50:56.840 --> 51:01.880]  that was the insurance policy now she lost and now they're trying to infiltrate
[51:01.880 --> 51:07.800]  the administration to really it's a coup it's spying it's everything that you
[51:07.800 --> 51:10.760]  could imagine it's hard to believe in this country that we would have had that
[51:10.760 --> 51:15.280]  I don't know if you remember a long time ago very early on I used the word wire
[51:15.280 --> 51:20.960]  tap and I put it in quotes meaning surveillance spying you can sort of say
[51:20.960 --> 51:25.040]  whatever you want but that was a long time ago and I've never seen anything
[51:25.040 --> 51:29.520]  like a blow-up like you've never seen now I understand why because they thought
[51:29.520 --> 51:34.520]  two years ago when I said that just on a little bit of a hunch and a little bit
[51:34.520 --> 51:42.040]  of wisdom maybe they it blew up because they thought maybe I was wise to them or
[51:42.040 --> 51:46.200]  they were caught and that's why because if they were doing anything wrong it
[51:46.200 --> 51:48.720]  would have just gone by nobody would have cared about it it was pretty
[51:48.720 --> 51:55.560]  insignificant I thought when I said it and it's pretty amazing so you see now
[51:55.560 --> 51:59.760]  they're in trying to infiltrate the White House this is long after the
[51:59.760 --> 52:05.120]  election it's a disgrace and again hopefully the Attorney General will do
[52:05.120 --> 52:09.280]  what's right and I really believe he will Mr. President the Attorney General
[52:09.280 --> 52:16.800]  actually used the word spying on your campaign we know of Stefan Halper and his
[52:16.800 --> 52:22.760]  contacts that he made with Papadopoulos and Carter Page and Sam Clovis we know
[52:22.760 --> 52:27.200]  about the FISA warrant as the Grassley Graham Memo said the bulk of
[52:27.200 --> 52:32.560]  information in the application was the Clinton bought and paid for Russian of
[52:32.560 --> 52:37.160]  all things dossier ignored by the Mueller report which I'll ask you about in a
[52:37.160 --> 52:42.760]  second here but those are two specific incidents of attempts to get into your
[52:42.760 --> 52:48.080]  campaign your reaction to all that well I think they made many attempts and then
[52:48.080 --> 52:52.440]  you see the lying and you see the leaking and you see Comey lie to Congress
[52:52.440 --> 52:57.600]  nothing happens you see him leaking nothing happens and this is leaking
[52:57.600 --> 53:02.400]  classified information this is leaking really big stuff I remember the young
[53:02.400 --> 53:07.080]  sailor in fact I helped him out with his family and so on and fairly treated as
[53:07.080 --> 53:12.080]  you know but I remember he had confidential information which is a much
[53:12.080 --> 53:18.160]  much lower standard than classified and they put him in jail for a long time
[53:18.160 --> 53:23.440]  they took away his life and you then you look at what Hillary Clinton did with
[53:23.440 --> 53:29.680]  33,000 emails and hundreds of thousands of text messages or emails going
[53:29.680 --> 53:35.800]  through the Wiener server or computer hundreds of thousands of which many
[53:35.800 --> 53:40.160]  were classified and nothing happens to her and yet they put a young sailor on
[53:40.160 --> 53:44.200]  for doing something innocent showing his mother and his friend what the desk
[53:44.200 --> 53:49.000]  looked like the desk in a 40 year old submarine I think Russia and China would
[53:49.000 --> 53:53.560]  have had that picture many years ago so it's really a double standard like you've
[53:53.560 --> 53:57.400]  never seen very very unfair but hopefully that will change I think that
[53:57.400 --> 54:02.240]  will be changing Mr. President closed or testimony recently revealed struck in
[54:02.240 --> 54:06.920]  page that they were laughing at the idea that the Hillary investigation was a
[54:06.920 --> 54:12.920]  real investigation and that it went directly into Loretta Lynch's office
[54:12.920 --> 54:18.680]  which now raises a whole new set of other questions and they were confident
[54:18.680 --> 54:22.040]  about that and it was struck that did the interview with Hillary
[54:22.040 --> 54:25.680]  uncharacteristically frankly unprecedented allowed two other people in
[54:25.680 --> 54:29.960]  that interview while she was being interviewed in an investigation comey
[54:29.960 --> 54:33.400]  of course exonerated her but even acknowledged top-secret classified
[54:33.400 --> 54:38.280]  information on that server I did disagree with you at the time you after the
[54:38.280 --> 54:44.880]  election were basically saying let bygones be bygones down this road and
[54:44.880 --> 54:49.480]  this is what I told the president over and over as well because one level they
[54:49.480 --> 54:52.920]  were saying okay we're gonna leave you alone we know you've got us but behind
[54:52.920 --> 54:55.280]  the scenes that we're trying to undermine trying to have a coup lying to
[54:55.280 --> 54:59.240]  Congress that's why they can't just be allowed to run around I get going after
[54:59.240 --> 55:02.200]  the globalist could trigger them to stage something even bigger it doesn't
[55:02.200 --> 55:05.320]  matter you can't let these criminals run free they're out of control they're
[55:05.320 --> 55:09.520]  arrogant Hillary's on the news this week saying arrest Trump with all the dirt
[55:09.520 --> 55:14.560]  on her and Lynch and all of them it's all upon news wars calm we've been
[55:14.560 --> 55:17.880]  literally the first to break all this down I keep going back to that because
[55:17.880 --> 55:20.920]  it makes us a target so I want to commend the listeners for your support
[55:20.920 --> 55:24.480]  what you've done has changed history you should really feel good about it but
[55:24.480 --> 55:28.560]  understand there's more rounds left in this fight let's go back to more the
[55:28.560 --> 55:33.800]  president do you regret saying that and do you think now if we really are to get
[55:33.800 --> 55:37.960]  to the bottom in the truth that has to also include Hillary Clinton the email
[55:37.960 --> 55:42.440]  server which would be an underlying crime and obstruction which every one of the
[55:42.440 --> 55:48.160]  media seems to care about the intent behind the 33,000 subpoenaed emails
[55:48.160 --> 55:56.120]  deleted bleach bit hammers sim cards no I don't regret saying it when I won they
[55:56.120 --> 56:01.080]  were all saying locker up locker up and I said no no let's get on with life that
[56:01.080 --> 56:04.480]  was different it was like right after the election you want to get a new page
[56:04.480 --> 56:09.960]  and turn turn over a new leaf and I said let's get on with it let's you know
[56:09.960 --> 56:13.320]  build up the economy which by the way is doing record business I'm so proud of
[56:13.320 --> 56:16.920]  the economy we're doing numbers that nobody's ever believed probably the best
[56:16.920 --> 56:21.880]  economy we've ever had best unemployment numbers we've ever had it's been
[56:21.880 --> 56:26.880]  incredible but I said let's get on with our life let's forget about the past but
[56:26.880 --> 56:31.920]  now what happened is fairly shortly after that great evening they started
[56:31.920 --> 56:36.200]  coming at us with the insurance policy and everything they did was so
[56:36.200 --> 56:41.720]  dishonest and then we really started looking into a lot of things like her

[59:50.160 --> 59:57.880]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:10.280]  think of the error crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones
[01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:16.720]  coming to you live from the front lines of the info war. Hillary has committed
[01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:20.800]  decades and decades of crimes believing she was above the law because she was
[01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:25.760]  protected by the power structure she was at the top of it and now on Monday she
[01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:29.800]  comes out and shoots her mouth off and says the president should be arrested
[01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:34.240]  for obstruction when she's the queen of obstruction with loretta lynch and others
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:43.520]  here she is. there's enough there that any other person who had engaged in those
[01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:52.520]  acts would certainly have been indicted the whole matter of obstruction was very
[01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:58.160]  directly sent to the Congress and if you read that part of the report it could
[01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:04.160]  not be clearer. really okay so let's go back to the president and the 45 minute
[01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:09.320]  out-of-the-park interview where he gets into every issue let's continue with the
[01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:14.640]  president. they started coming at us with the insurance policy and everything
[01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:20.320]  they did was so dishonest and then we really started looking into a lot of
[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:25.400]  things like her deleted emails and acid washed emails which is unheard of
[01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:30.200]  because of the expense of doing it and how she got away with it how her lawyer
[01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:34.360]  got away with it how all of these things happened don't forget when they
[01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:40.400]  interviewed her that was on July 4th weekend it was very very late into the
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:44.160]  July 4th weekend they asked her questions they didn't have a
[01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:48.280]  stenographer they didn't have anybody swear her in they didn't have a tape
[01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:53.800]  recorder they just walked in asked her some questions and that was fine in the
[01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:58.040]  meantime look at what she's done how she's destroyed the lives of people that
[01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:03.560]  were on our campaign she's destroyed their lives in the DNC and frankly when
[01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:09.840]  the FBI went into the DNC the DNC told them to get the hell out of here think
[01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:13.080]  of that they told that to the FBI and they wouldn't give them the server I
[01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:17.400]  want to find out what's on that server the DNC server because that's the big
[01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:21.920]  thing nobody's seen that server yet the FBI didn't see it and these are the top
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:29.520]  people at the FBI where you had absolute dirty cops these were dirty cops now the
[01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:34.880]  FBI I know FBI guys these are the best in the world but the people leading at
[01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:40.840]  Comey and McCabe and Scrook and Page and all of these people the lawyer who
[01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:45.920]  admitted frankly how crooked things were I mean the when that testimony comes
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:49.920]  out it's already come out partially when that testimony comes out from the
[01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:54.680]  attorney for the FBI you'll see so I really say now we have to get down
[01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:59.600]  because this was a coup this was an attempted overthrow no stay right here
[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:02.840]  back it up 20 seconds I'm gonna come back and finish up with the part I'm
[01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:06.920]  gonna play and if we have time later I'll play more but but something hit me
[01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:12.520]  while I was watching this just now that we all know but that has to be stated
[01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:16.640]  very clearly not just to ourselves and to others because we're an information
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:23.560]  war but to the president because he gets distracted with a million things and
[01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:30.440]  he's tough and so he'll he'll tend to be a little overconfident sometimes but I
[01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:35.640]  want to explain something when we come back that is a paramount to all of this
[01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:42.480]  because we think of it as there's Trump and there's the Democrats and then
[01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:47.600]  their special interests but that's not really what's going on here that's
[01:03:47.600 --> 01:04:00.400]  only half the equation maybe less maybe 40% of the equation so we come back the
[01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:05.240]  secret to defeating the deep state why they want to software is that I have
[01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:11.560]  studied history worldwide in-depth really read probably I don't want to
[01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:15.880]  exaggerate 500 books on history alone and I know how I know how these systems
[01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:23.680]  operate and it's not just it's not just the Republicans or Democrats it's not
[01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:28.760]  just foreign powers it's not just special interest like a lot of you are
[01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:33.520]  smarter than I am you probably know I'm gonna lay it out though when we come
[01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:44.840]  back on the other side you may find it will come and do what must be done well
[01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:49.040]  they're right back on Alex Jones tomorrow's news today info wars dot com

[01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:28.320]  from deep in the heart of FEMA region 6 Austin Texas transmitting worldwide it's
[01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:37.840]  Alex Jones and frankly when the FBI went into the DNC the DNC told them to get
[01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:42.080]  the hell out of here think of that they told that to the FBI and they wouldn't
[01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:45.920]  give them the server I want to find out what's on that server the DNC server
[01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:50.360]  because that's the big thing nobody's seen that survey at the FBI didn't see it
[01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:57.320]  and these are the top people at the FBI where you had absolute dirty cops these
[01:06:57.320 --> 01:07:03.800]  with dirty cops now the FBI I know FBI guys these are the best in the world but
[01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:09.680]  the people leading at Comey and McCabe and stroke and Page and all of these
[01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:14.720]  people the lawyer who admitted frankly how crooked things were I mean the when
[01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:19.040]  that testimony comes out it's already come out partially when that testimony
[01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:24.200]  comes out from the attorney for the FBI you'll see so I really say now we have
[01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:29.160]  to get down because this was a coup this was an attempted overthrow of the
[01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:34.000]  United States government we had people coming out to vote from all over this
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:38.480]  country that are in love with what we're doing it's called make America great
[01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:43.200]  again that's what we've done and we're doing and this was an overthrow and it's
[01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:47.600]  a disgraceful thing and I don't I think it's far bigger than Watergate I
[01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:52.440]  think it's possibly the biggest scandal in political history in this country
[01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:57.440]  maybe beyond political so I think that a lot of things are being learned right
[01:07:57.440 --> 01:08:02.640]  now just like you just mentioned just a few moments ago again with
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:07.000]  struck and Page he's a sick people he's a sick sick people you know so let's see
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:11.600]  what happens with McCabe and Comey and Brennan and clapper they weren't in the
[01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:16.080]  act and let's see what happens and let's see how high it goes up because it's
[01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:21.680]  inconceivable when it goes to clapper Brennan comey these people I would
[01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:25.560]  imagine that some other people may be a little bit higher up also knew about it
[01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:30.240]  and maybe a lot higher up all right go back to that in a moment this I don't
[01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:33.880]  normally air 10 15 minutes of somebody else's show but Sean Hannity's doing a
[01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:37.520]  great job and he had the president on laying out exactly what I told you I
[01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:42.040]  just got back from DC yesterday at like 10 in the morning I laid out that I've
[01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:47.160]  met with three people high-level that had personally met with the president two
[01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:50.360]  of them personally met one of them talked to him and he said I'm taking the
[01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:54.040]  gloves off we know Obama and Hillary are behind it they have all the proof they
[01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:58.560]  have all the documents but they are going to sit there and just lay it out
[01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:06.200]  slowly let the Democrats lie and catch him in even bigger frauds because you
[01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:09.840]  already have clapper and Brennan three weeks ago I played the clips for a
[01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:14.040]  whole week every day and we should think about playing again clapper and
[01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:19.720]  Brennan especially Brennan he's the real mastermind ran up on television on CNN
[01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:23.080]  MSNBC and said we're not getting in trouble I'm not worried about being
[01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:28.880]  indicted for illegally spying on Trump I was ordered to buy Obama still illegal
[01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:34.880]  then you lied to Congress after Obama was out of office you are done if Trump
[01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:38.920]  pulls the political trigger and guess what he's already pulled it jackass in
[01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:43.200]  fact that's the big announcement here the trigger was already pulled before
[01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:46.440]  Hillary went and ran her mouth about arresting Trump last week but it's done
[01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:51.160]  lady so we need to everybody needs to have their eyes peeled though for dirty
[01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:54.280]  tricks they might pull to try to derail this because they are definitely
[01:09:54.280 --> 01:10:01.160]  scared right now now let me get to the thing though that is the wild card here
[01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:05.040]  a lot of people think well there's a Republican Party and there's a Democrat
[01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:11.480]  Party and then there's a legislative that's made up of the two parties and
[01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:14.880]  then you've got of course the executive that's the president and then you've got
[01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:19.280]  the judiciary that's the courts and Trump's got a lot of the governors and
[01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:23.360]  he's got the Senate and he's got the executive but we don't have the House
[01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:27.200]  and you look at it you think of the election coming up as if Bernie Sanders
[01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:33.480]  or somebody like Biden are battling for control of Democratic Party Hillary
[01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:39.000]  Clinton and the globalist are still in control move on or George Soros they
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:43.120]  still call the shots and that's why Hillary so arrogant and that's why
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:48.320]  they're pushing Joe Biden because he's part of that combine so Trump has to go
[01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:52.400]  ahead and prosecute Hillary because just that happening will make everybody
[01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:57.200]  roll over on her and her cohorts but if that doesn't happen she can still
[01:10:57.200 --> 01:11:02.480]  arrogantly sit there and threaten her minions in the FBI the CIA she has to
[01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:05.880]  control all of them but keep people they've been stacking the deck for a
[01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:08.920]  long time they've been putting their moles in there for a long time she's got
[01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:13.440]  to put that confidence game on so that all these mutinous individuals inside
[01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:18.480]  the government keep following their orders to sabotage the country but
[01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:22.360]  Trump talks about the interview the record number of people resigning he
[01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:26.960]  likes that they're getting out now you go back a year ago two years ago
[01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:33.240]  Brennan Clapper others mud they would all say hang on a comb he said if you're in
[01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:37.760]  the government stay there and fight this president don't do what he says in
[01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:43.360]  the executive basically engage in espionage but suddenly you see the mayor
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:48.880]  of Baltimore being arrested suddenly you see all these other Democrats being
[01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:52.600]  arrested suddenly you see federal judges that are letting illegal aliens go
[01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:55.400]  that are getting money from Democrat groups that get money from illegal
[01:11:55.400 --> 01:12:01.320]  aliens they're being arrested because it's criminal what they're doing so the
[01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:05.360]  gloves are off and you're gonna see Trump because he's exercising rightful
[01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:10.360]  power not a usurpation of power not a power grab but a real defense you're
[01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:15.800]  going to see massive arrest they're beginning if the roll-up has begun the
[01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:23.080]  grand juries are open I'll say this too I've been around 24 years president
[01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:26.040]  Trump came on my show and said your reputation is amazing I will not let
[01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:31.760]  you down no one knows who QAnon is it's a bunch of people on 4chan and 8chan it
[01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:36.000]  says some good things it says some bad things but even after I've tried to be
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:41.120]  nice to 4chan and 8chan and the whole Q thing it comes out and says Jones is
[01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:46.040]  a Zionist shill he's gonna get arrested all this crap Trump's daughter is married
[01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:50.640]  to a orthodox Jew Trump is pro-Israel but you guys don't attack him because
[01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:54.280]  he's too big a target but see that paradox of Q becoming anti-semitic
[01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:58.040]  that's not the real Q if Q was ever real we don't need a bunch of anti-semitic
[01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:02.360]  crap a bunch of anti-Israel stuff that's a diversion the chai comms of the issue
[01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:07.240]  the EU is the issue the UN collapsing our borders the issue are there some bad
[01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:11.040]  Jews in the world damn right there's some bad everything I don't work for Israel
[01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:16.760]  I'm not paid by Israel I get attacked by a lot of the Jewish lobby my god but the
[01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:20.480]  idea that QAnon is attacking me constantly going he's an Israeli
[01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:23.600]  shill don't listen to him or maybe it's not even government agents at QAnon
[01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:27.600]  they're Democrats maybe they're just people that think there's a set market
[01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:30.600]  of conspiracy which there isn't I'm trying to take the country in the
[01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:35.000]  world back and so we can knock Alex off we'll be the ones people listen to it's
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:40.080]  the death of logic and its mental illness your reputation is amazing Alex
[01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:45.840]  Jones I will not let you down President Trump keep it up you're doing a great
[01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:52.400]  job Alex the Capitol Police the Secret Service all love me I was able to
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:56.240]  bullhorn without a permit I mean what do you think's going on here but but the
[01:13:56.240 --> 01:14:02.360]  idea again how I'm being attacked from the rear by so-called QAnon that's
[01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:06.760]  how I started going after QAnon is they were attacking me again who is QAnon
[01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:10.280]  oh let's all just trust some anonymous thing that lays out breadcrumbs and says
[01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:14.440]  as we all go we all go and all this stuff and I'm like okay fine just leave me
[01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:19.040]  alone let me go out and be a real person in the field in the arena and it just
[01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:24.360]  doesn't stop and so again the question to QAnon whoever it is whatever groups
[01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:28.640]  that magically have I could pose as QAnon online start a website and say
[01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:34.440]  whatever I wanted it's crazy it's nuts we have the real people on we have the
[01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:38.800]  Colonel Schaefer's on we have the Ron Paul and Rand Paul's on we have the
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:43.120]  Eric Bowling's on we we have you know Tucker Carlson we're fighting the
[01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:47.640]  globalist we're for real we're getting an effect you know our name you know who
[01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:51.520]  my daddy is my mama is you've seen them be platformers you've seen them come
[01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:58.280]  after us and Q is just a secret critic and people love riddles they love jigsaw
[01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:02.000]  puzzles they love this and I've seen some really good stuff Q's put out whoever
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:05.360]  it's a consortium I've seen some bad stuff it's like people used to ask you do
[01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:09.560]  you like anonymous and I said a lot of good stuff comes out of anonymous
[01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:13.560]  anonymous is anybody that's a whistleblower so a lot of anonymous is good a
[01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:17.840]  lot of anonymous is bad and I think some of the lower IQ people out there just
[01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:21.080]  want something simple they can believe it to go along with it it's very very
[01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:24.360]  dangerous that's all I'm saying so we're gonna go to break them back and
[01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:28.400]  finish up with this powerful Trump piece but Hillary Clinton still is in
[01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:33.000]  control of a lot of the bureaucracy with the bushes and they're trying to hold
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:36.400]  on their power but as Trump consolidates power they are getting less and less
[01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:40.440]  power to threaten their minions to carry out criminal operations against
[01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:45.000]  America so they're just resigning instead because the Clintons are telling
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:48.800]  them you either resign or you fight Trump they're resigning now we're winning
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:53.280]  praise God this is a great thing news wars comm stay with us we'll be right

[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:10.160]  on the big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and
[01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:16.120]  acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could
[01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:20.960]  lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series
[01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:26.920]  of tests for heavy metals alkalinity and pH what we learned was that there was in
[01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:31.800]  fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next we
[01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:36.080]  tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the
[01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:41.320]  heavy metal levels within safe measure but the pH was also restored to optimal
[01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:46.880]  levels as it turns out the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water
[01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:51.560]  so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a
[01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:56.480]  rainwater supply but more importantly a good water filtration system will
[01:19:56.480 --> 01:19:59.160]  purify it

[01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:30.280]  to the president landed out on Sean Hannity last night I would imagine that
[01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:33.920]  some other people may be a little bit higher up also knew about it and maybe a
[01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:38.920]  lot higher up you mentioned I mentioned now struck in page independently in
[01:21:38.920 --> 01:21:42.520]  their conversations Peter struck had said about the collusion there's no
[01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:47.440]  they're there Lisa Page closed-door testimony actually said after the nine
[01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:51.800]  month FBI investigation they had no evidence of anything with you and your
[01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:56.480]  campaign in Russia that's before the appointment of Mueller we also had the
[01:21:56.480 --> 01:22:02.800]  House Intel Committee report that's to no collusion then the Senate bipartisan
[01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:06.800]  committee and now the rock Muller reporters you said oh any news no
[01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:12.080]  obstruction no collusion what I want you what is your full reaction to the Muller
[01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:20.120]  report well it was as I call them 13 angry Democrats they were supplanted by
[01:22:20.120 --> 01:22:28.960]  five more five more were added and you got up to 1819 20 they're all Democrats
[01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:35.320]  many of them made major contributions to the Hillary Clinton campaign and they
[01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:40.480]  had one of them was one of the top people at the Clinton Foundation Genie Ray
[01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:47.440]  then you had Weissman you had some bad bad bad people no friends of Trump I had
[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:54.640]  no friends it was like a one-sided witch hunt as I called it and you know Bob
[01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:58.520]  Muller I turned him down to run the FBI the next day he was appointed to be the
[01:22:58.520 --> 01:23:03.280]  head of this this special counsel as they call it is really a much tougher
[01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:09.080]  word than that but I won't use it and it was a terrible thing he was conflicted
[01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:14.400]  for that for that reason he also was conflicted because of the fact that
[01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:19.880]  Comey and him are best friends so if not best very close to best but I would say
[01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:25.520]  best friends you look at pictures of the two of them in the past we had a nasty
[01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:30.960]  business transaction the two of us I had a nasty transaction with him and then
[01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:37.480]  all of a sudden he's my prosecutor very very unfair and with all of that and
[01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:42.480]  thirty five million dollars spent think of that over two years ruining lives of
[01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:47.120]  people ruining their lives people going out of business because they couldn't
[01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:51.760]  afford lawyers that's just unbelievable what happened how bad it was I can't
[01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:55.720]  even tell you how bad it was nobody nobody knows what how people suffered
[01:23:55.720 --> 01:24:02.200]  great people that came to Washington they came to DC to set the world in a
[01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:06.720]  very positive way on fire they wanted to clean things up and do a great job and
[01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:12.800]  all of a sudden they're testifying on nonsense and it's really shaving you
[01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:15.680]  know with all of the things you've heard nothing had to do with the campaign
[01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:22.680]  nothing had to do with Russia collusion but the bottom line is with a group of
[01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:28.640]  very serious Trump haters a group of I call them angry Democrats somebody who
[01:24:28.640 --> 01:24:34.200]  was very conflicted at the top no collusion and also no obstruction because
[01:24:34.200 --> 01:24:39.640]  the statement was made and the Attorney General you know understood it very well
[01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:45.360]  and he read it and he made a decision right on the spot no obstruction so he
[01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:51.240]  had no collusion no obstruction thirty five million dollars spent and unlimited
[01:24:51.240 --> 01:25:00.280]  manpower woman power and there's nothing nothing and it was a very bad two
[01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:05.680]  years for this country but what has happened is we found everything going in
[01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:10.240]  the opposite direction and I think now it's turning unbelievable the tables
[01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:14.600]  have turned and you're seeing things come out like you just like you just
[01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:19.640]  noticed and it's I think it's going to be very interesting it's very important
[01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:24.280]  for the country to now find out how that whole thing started and in all fairness
[01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:30.160]  to Bob Mueller it started long before he was appointed this was going on long
[01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:35.160]  before that you understand the first lady and I came down on the escalator on
[01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:40.360]  June 16th and this started very shortly after that it was a disgrace
[01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:45.960]  disgrace we expect a lot more coming out in the days weeks and even months
[01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:52.960]  ahead we know at least 53 more closed door the testimony closed door of many
[01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:58.040]  of these players that will be released we know that the Inspector General he
[01:25:58.040 --> 01:26:02.600]  now will have his report we expect sometime in perhaps in May likely in May
[01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:09.920]  where he will he's been investigating the FISA abuse issue and then of course
[01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:14.160]  we have Hoover on leaking and then whatever his report ultimately ends up
[01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:18.920]  becoming we know that you know there's there's a lot of information and then
[01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:23.600]  the issue you have the last time I talked to you about a month ago you said
[01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:28.920]  you would declassify the FISA applications you would declassify gang of
[01:26:28.920 --> 01:26:34.440]  eight material 302 material if the Grassley Graham Nunes memos are correct
[01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:39.800]  in the bulk of information in the FISA applications were even as the New York
[01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:44.720]  Times suggested this week may have been misinformation from the Russians that
[01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:49.600]  Hillary bought and paid for that was disseminated to the media and the
[01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:56.120]  American people before that election you know what would that mean to you well
[01:26:56.120 --> 01:26:59.760]  first of all I was very impressed that the New York Times did that because that
[01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:03.320]  was the first good glimpse that maybe mainstream is going to pick up the
[01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:08.720]  greatest political scandal of in the history of our country again bigger than
[01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:14.200]  Watergate because it means so much this was a coup this wasn't stealing
[01:27:14.200 --> 01:27:18.240]  information from an office in the Watergate apartments this is this was an
[01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:23.400]  attempted coup and it's inconceivable like a third-world country and
[01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:28.000]  inconceivable and I have to say that I think a lot of information is coming out
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:33.120]  and it's coming out fast much faster than anybody would have thought and there
[01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:37.760]  are a lot of people very nervous about things that are going on and I will say
[01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:43.160]  that IG the Inspector General Horowitz so Trump knows what's going on but he's
[01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:47.040]  he's letting them stew in their juices and is making his move against him I've
[01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:50.440]  talked to three people two of which met with him personally one who was
[01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:54.800]  persecuted one is a major journalist the other I'm not going to mention and they
[01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:58.320]  said this early last week that Trump is going to go after them the Justice
[01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:02.160]  Department is going to indict them they have all the proof and so that's the big
[01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:08.480]  news is that Trump is going to push in green light a political war with the
[01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:15.920]  deep state to indict Hillary Comey McCabe, Strock, Page, Brennan, Clapper all of
[01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:19.960]  them all of them have committed incredibly brazen crimes thought they
[01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:24.040]  were invincible thought they were above the law and Muller who was trying to
[01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:28.440]  pin this on Trump rolled over realizing how sloppily it had been done in which
[01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:32.480]  way the wind was blowing and so their whole attempted criminal operation is
[01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:39.120]  going down in giant flames and we just laid all that out in the last hour when
[01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:43.920]  we come back we're going to get into the latest information that's unfolding on

[01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:08.640]  but if you took it with fish oil it's like the fish oil is it the fish oil is
[01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:11.920]  better than it and that's an example of what I'm talking about fish oil is
[01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:17.120]  liquid energy brain body heart the cleanest the best out there you've got
[01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:20.600]  the children's you've got the adults you've got the krill oil if you're gonna
[01:31:20.600 --> 01:31:23.760]  get the full effect the fish oil and the children's are really strong they
[01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:26.920]  don't give you the burpees but krill oils is the best and it'll give you the
[01:31:26.920 --> 01:31:29.960]  damn burps and I'm just sorry you want something like this you don't get stuff
[01:31:29.960 --> 01:31:33.880]  for free the krill is hallucinogenic it's so good in my view I'm not a
[01:31:33.880 --> 01:31:37.280]  medical statement here but let me tell you something I eat five capillates of
[01:31:37.280 --> 01:31:43.320]  krill oil before I go to bed I'm seeing Santa Claus that night so your brain is
[01:31:43.320 --> 01:31:51.440]  made basically out of what fish oil is so we don't make a big profit off of it
[01:31:51.440 --> 01:31:54.600]  but you notice I just obsessed because whatever the best is we've got I just
[01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:59.600]  can't lie to you I just can't do it Frank in North Carolina thanks for

[01:33:11.080 --> 01:33:17.240]  you walk into this room at your own risk because it leads to the future not a
[01:33:17.240 --> 01:33:23.360]  future that will be but one that might be this is not a new world it is simply
[01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:28.760]  an extension of what began in the old one it is patterned itself after every
[01:33:28.760 --> 01:33:32.640]  dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of
[01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:38.520]  history since the beginning of time it has refinements technological advances
[01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:43.960]  and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom but like
[01:33:43.960 --> 01:33:49.760]  every one of the super states that preceded it it has one iron rule logic
[01:33:49.760 --> 01:34:00.720]  is an enemy and truth is a menace this is mr. Romney Wordsworth in his last 48
[01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:05.480]  hours on earth he's a citizen of the state but will soon have to be eliminated
[01:34:05.480 --> 01:34:11.720]  because he's built out of flesh and because he has a mind mr. Romney
[01:34:11.720 --> 01:34:28.160]  Wordsworth who will draw his last breaths in the Twilight Zone
[01:34:28.160 --> 01:34:35.200]  we're now 19 years four months into the 21st century oh it's science fiction
[01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:40.160]  how we thought it'd be but it's here oh wait it is what I thought it would be
[01:34:40.160 --> 01:34:44.360]  because I was reading the globalist battle plan they want to seize the future
[01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:49.600]  by controlling civilization and its development I want you to control your
[01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:56.000]  own destiny and have free will because I follow God's plan I'm Alex Jones your
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:03.360]  host okay we have got a giant plethora of news and information to cover I did
[01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:08.680]  just spend the last hour and a half covering the events I witnessed in DC
[01:35:08.680 --> 01:35:13.600]  the sources I talked to and of course you see it all crowned with a cherry on
[01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:18.640]  top by the president basically saying everything I said on Sean Hannity last
[01:35:18.640 --> 01:35:23.400]  night this is a really good sign and it shows us that the president is really
[01:35:23.400 --> 01:35:26.320]  going in the right direction does that mean he's gonna do everything the way
[01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:30.040]  we all wanting to do no I'm sure as listeners you disagree with a lot of
[01:35:30.040 --> 01:35:34.520]  what I have to say I probably disagree with what some of what you think but
[01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:38.520]  overall he's trying to be president he's trying to have prosperity he's trying to
[01:35:38.520 --> 01:35:42.320]  be pragmatic he's trying to not sell the country out that said start the next
[01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:49.760]  segment he has done something last 24 hours that is a big bad problem it's
[01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:54.440]  not something we can halfway disagree with him on this is something very very
[01:35:54.440 --> 01:35:58.680]  serious so we're gonna have to take the president proverbially to the woodshed
[01:35:58.680 --> 01:36:06.120]  start the next segment and then later in the next hour I interviewed Eric
[01:36:06.120 --> 01:36:13.720]  Mowling very powerful interview then he interviewed me for 25 minutes for a
[01:36:13.720 --> 01:36:18.520]  syndicated TV show and for Sinclair both blaze TV and Sinclair where they both
[01:36:18.520 --> 01:36:25.200]  aired we're going to air part of my interview with him and then the whole
[01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:31.440]  Sinclair or blaze TV interview in the last 45 minutes of the next hour because
[01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:34.920]  it needs to go out to the full stations it's great audio it's great visuals as
[01:36:34.920 --> 01:36:38.360]  well it was perfect for radio and TV some of these interviews aren't good
[01:36:38.360 --> 01:36:42.000]  because we're simulcast so it's not good for radio or it's not good for TV this
[01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:47.080]  is a really powerful interview but the the topic he got into because we were
[01:36:47.080 --> 01:36:51.840]  privately talking about provocateurs trying to start fights with us and
[01:36:51.840 --> 01:36:55.320]  trying to come up and confront us at restaurants they've done it took a
[01:36:55.320 --> 01:36:59.440]  Carlson they do it to Trump's family they do it to Eric he warned me while I
[01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:03.600]  was in the Trump hotel where he stays a few days a week when he's in DC that
[01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:08.680]  provocateurs will try to come up and start fights with you mainly I got nothing
[01:37:08.680 --> 01:37:14.520]  but love in there but they said routinely people do pull the fire alarm to
[01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:21.120]  harass the patrons and it happened at midnight on Wednesday night you know I
[01:37:21.120 --> 01:37:25.680]  was getting up at 3 30 to catch a 6 a.m. flight that was all enjoyable but I'd
[01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:29.640]  stay there all over again just to thumb it the nose the establishment because
[01:37:29.640 --> 01:37:35.120]  Max Kaiser was in there and all these other cool people you want to see the
[01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:42.880]  bar scene of conservatives and liberals and media matters and Buzzfeed sneaking
[01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:47.760]  around in there go have cocktails or go in there at happy hour or in the
[01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:54.840]  evening at Trump Hotel in DC and it is wild and it's a super nice hotel on
[01:37:54.840 --> 01:38:00.240]  top of it I love the love the whole motif I love that black-on-white marble and
[01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:06.720]  the blue on it and just the whole setup is exactly exactly my style like my
[01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:10.560]  wife wanted to remodel the house and I said yeah let's do it like this he was
[01:38:10.560 --> 01:38:14.840]  oh I like that I said yeah let's go with the Trump Hotel look at least for the
[01:38:14.840 --> 01:38:22.240]  living room and dining room but I'm digressing my friends it's just that
[01:38:22.240 --> 01:38:29.920]  when he was telling me about what they did to his son and then he actually
[01:38:29.920 --> 01:38:36.360]  started crying because the crew his crew hadn't gotten there to the capital yet
[01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:42.120]  on Wednesday in the morning we try to talk about what they did to him after
[01:38:42.120 --> 01:38:46.360]  his son died he literally couldn't help it like tears were out of his eyes I
[01:38:46.360 --> 01:38:50.520]  couldn't blame him and they told the story of what they did to him and I said
[01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:53.160]  you really told this is well not all of it and I haven't really put the video
[01:38:53.160 --> 01:38:56.960]  out even though it got caught on video but what they did to him shows you how
[01:38:56.960 --> 01:39:02.320]  incredibly nasty these people are you know about the opium epidemic you know
[01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:06.320]  what the opioid epidemic you know that it's ten times the number of people are
[01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:10.720]  dying every year that we're dying 20 years ago I mean everybody I know has
[01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:15.400]  friends or family that have people that have almost died or died from pills and
[01:39:15.400 --> 01:39:18.800]  there's so much stronger than they've ever been and they're all over the place
[01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:23.400]  they've been subscribing ten times the number they used to so ten times the
[01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:30.000]  death boy math works that way and his son died of an opium overdose a pill
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:34.520]  overdose they were best friends I know folks that knew him and it just tears
[01:39:34.520 --> 01:39:41.000]  his guts out and then they say your son killed himself because he was ashamed of
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:45.200]  you being fired because that all happened at the same time he was fired for
[01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:49.880]  made-up stuff but it's how they came in and set him up and laughed at him to try
[01:39:49.880 --> 01:39:54.640]  to get him to hit him so they could then get him fired off his new job and and
[01:39:54.640 --> 01:39:58.720]  that's why I've got to remember because they may confront me 20 times in the
[01:39:58.720 --> 01:40:02.800]  street or knock my drink over or slap me in the back of the head or confront me
[01:40:02.800 --> 01:40:07.680]  and I'm 19 times out of 20 I take it but like that Lucy's fried chicken man
[01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:11.280]  three times they came to my table and said f you you're gonna get it you're
[01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:14.720]  gonna be basically dead soon it was like you're gonna be gone soon you're gonna
[01:40:14.720 --> 01:40:20.280]  get it yeah f you yeah f you and just look at me like I'll get you and and and
[01:40:20.280 --> 01:40:25.280]  you know you want to break their jaw but you can't do it we just had to be
[01:40:25.280 --> 01:40:28.480]  Christlike at this point and not because we're wimps but because it's what they
[01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:32.120]  want we're beating them politically we're beating them culturally we're
[01:40:32.120 --> 01:40:35.800]  beating them with the awakening happening and it's why the establishment is
[01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:42.480]  panicking so it's much fun as it beat up just break their nose then they win then
[01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:46.640]  they win and so even though I've had a dump hot coffee in my face dump tea on
[01:40:46.640 --> 01:40:51.560]  the back of my head spit Coca-Cola in my face Jimmy door even though I've had
[01:40:51.560 --> 01:40:57.240]  them you step on my hand so I was in a hot tub in Hawaiian the guy stepped on
[01:40:57.240 --> 01:41:00.840]  my hand and I said I thought let's sure that's an accident he gets in the hot
[01:41:00.840 --> 01:41:03.680]  tub and starts going you're really tough aren't you Alex want you get out of
[01:41:03.680 --> 01:41:07.080]  here then his own friend said hey you're gonna get thrown out let's get out of
[01:41:07.080 --> 01:41:11.120]  here these people have no I mean how that guy feel I just jumped on him and
[01:41:11.120 --> 01:41:14.720]  slammed his head under the jaw back into the back into the edge of the hot tub and
[01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:18.360]  he and he break his neck I mean dude you don't know who you're messing with I'm
[01:41:18.360 --> 01:41:21.960]  not bragging here but I will explosively attack you people you're
[01:41:21.960 --> 01:41:25.040]  really playing with fire but I understand Eric Bowling's former
[01:41:25.040 --> 01:41:28.400]  professional baseball player is successful he's a tough guy too and you
[01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:31.600]  know people mess with you man and they mess with you and they met like this guy
[01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:35.000]  they got on video of your TV viewer spitting in my face grabbing my testicles
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:38.400]  hitting me in the face with his fan which actually hit my eye it actually
[01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:42.320]  crashed my eye people said oh Bill you don't be a wimp you have to sit there and
[01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:46.640]  just take it like Obi-Wan Kenobi because there's a larger situation by the way he
[01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:50.520]  kept telling me how much he likes children do you like children oh he
[01:41:50.520 --> 01:41:56.000]  grabbed my testicles so these are sick people is all I'm telling you and they
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:00.760]  want violence because they're losing the political fight and that's why we can't
[01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:04.320]  let him pull off new Charlotteville's or any other stuff where they hire a bunch
[01:42:04.320 --> 01:42:07.520]  of fake white supremacists which we know they did and then have them clash with a
[01:42:07.520 --> 01:42:10.560]  bunch of professors and black uniforms see I didn't get to the news I would I
[01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:15.680]  digressed off into that Eric Bowling next hour first part of the interview that

[01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:07.560]  noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored the most
[01:44:07.560 --> 01:44:14.920]  buried the most suppressed and that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election
[01:44:14.920 --> 01:44:19.240]  night all the arrogant leftist authoritarians like the young turds and
[01:44:19.240 --> 01:44:24.760]  others it's so but hurt when Trump won they don't want us to have that victory
[01:44:24.760 --> 01:44:29.920]  they don't want us to remember what political action did and that's why the

[01:51:13.720 --> 01:51:18.840]  crime they've got to be met they've got to be dealt with but this is the
[01:51:18.840 --> 01:51:22.720]  beginning of the type of activity we need to see there's footage I don't know

[01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:10.760]  armed troops disarmed US soldiers on American side of the border that's how
[01:52:10.760 --> 01:52:15.920]  pathetic the establishment in Mexico thinks we are and much of their army
[01:52:15.920 --> 01:52:20.120]  openly works for the cartels as Trump rightly said this was a diversion for
[01:52:20.120 --> 01:52:24.960]  them to bring drugs across and now we have constant footage of armed men
[01:52:24.960 --> 01:52:32.640]  wearing ski mask leading the invaders who've paid them money to be smuggled
[01:52:32.640 --> 01:52:40.840]  into the US across this is how it all works ladies and gentlemen as anarchy
[01:52:40.840 --> 01:52:44.680]  of the third world sweeps into our country and is almost all the middle

[01:53:53.520 --> 01:53:57.720]  New York City have to admit it's illegal aliens spreading the measles and
[01:53:57.720 --> 01:54:01.640]  pertussis whooping cough but it doesn't matter people that have had the
[01:54:01.640 --> 01:54:05.640]  vaccines are getting it so they're saying oh get another shot well wait I got
[01:54:05.640 --> 01:54:09.840]  one a year ago the vaccines are scams they don't protect you they're trojan
[01:54:09.840 --> 01:54:13.400]  horses for other things but the point is you bring any legals from collapsed

[01:54:16.960 --> 01:54:21.080]  running water and hygiene had eradicated these things now we bring in the third
[01:54:21.080 --> 01:54:25.920]  world it's back but then even Trump comes out and says we need to all take
[01:54:25.920 --> 01:54:29.120]  measles shots no we need to stop the illegal aliens that are not even being
[01:54:29.120 --> 01:54:35.080]  screened here's that report Karen Hicks has been in Los Angeles for a long time
[01:54:35.080 --> 01:54:38.600]  her family has run a business there for more than a hundred years and they say
[01:54:38.600 --> 01:54:42.360]  the city is becoming unlivable Karen Hicks joins us and Karen thanks very
[01:54:42.360 --> 01:54:47.200]  much for coming on tonight we're gonna put as we speak pictures on the screen I
[01:54:47.200 --> 01:54:51.760]  think that you took from around your business what it actually looks like so
[01:54:51.760 --> 01:54:57.760]  your family has a business basically in downtown Los Angeles yes it's been in
[01:54:57.760 --> 01:55:05.440]  the same location for over 102 years and yes these are our pictures of what is
[01:55:05.440 --> 01:55:10.160]  going on right around our neighborhood so we're seeing I mean some of these
[01:55:10.160 --> 01:55:13.760]  pictures are are almost too disgusting to put on the screen but there we have a
[01:55:13.760 --> 01:55:21.520]  number of them of RVs yes people are living in those full-time yes people
[01:55:21.520 --> 01:55:27.520]  are living in them full-time you will notice there is raw sewage that is
[01:55:27.520 --> 01:55:32.800]  coming out this raw sewage it ends up in one place in our gutters which goes
[01:55:32.800 --> 01:55:41.160]  down to our oceans it is it's more than an environmental crisis it is a health
[01:55:41.160 --> 01:55:46.880]  crisis down in this area I have reached out to our council person councilman
[01:55:46.880 --> 01:55:53.240]  price I've reached out to Mayor Garcetti and as of today you know they have not
[01:55:53.240 --> 01:55:59.800]  contacted me now we got in contact with you because you copied us on an email to
[01:55:59.800 --> 01:56:04.720]  lawmakers in your city just happened I saw it in our in the inbox and was so
[01:56:04.720 --> 01:56:08.360]  shocked by these pictures and you were nice enough to come on and tell us what
[01:56:08.360 --> 01:56:13.480]  does it say about your lawmakers that they don't even respond to you you know
[01:56:13.480 --> 01:56:19.960]  it it's so disheartening to know that you know we're kind of at the bottom of
[01:56:19.960 --> 01:56:25.680]  the the totem pole we have a very good relationship with our senior lead officer
[01:56:25.680 --> 01:56:32.840]  in our area and he is the only one if anything positive does happen it's only
[01:56:32.840 --> 01:56:39.200]  because of him personally my calls to the city just they go unanswered or it
[01:56:39.200 --> 01:56:44.480]  goes from one to the other I mean it's so Garcetti your mayor lives there and
[01:56:44.480 --> 01:56:49.640]  the city is falling apart and as you're again on the screen raw sewage in the
[01:56:49.640 --> 01:56:55.920]  street yes I mean what's their explanation for this well I would love to
[01:56:55.920 --> 01:57:03.080]  hear it but like I said they they will not contact me and you know I would love
[01:57:03.080 --> 01:57:09.400]  to have a discussion about you have invited them here to live on our streets
[01:57:09.400 --> 01:57:14.840]  and our sidewalks by disregarding the laws that are actually in place and not
[01:57:14.840 --> 01:57:18.640]  letting our law right we gotta go to break we gotta go to break but if you're a

[02:00:24.480 --> 02:00:29.160]  in the next segment and I'm gonna get into the real story behind their attempt
[02:00:29.160 --> 02:00:36.080]  to get rid of the Secretary of Defense over criticism of the fraud that is the
[02:00:36.080 --> 02:00:41.320]  F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and that failure this is big we're gonna hit that
[02:00:41.320 --> 02:00:44.800]  next segment and the Eric Boling interviews coming up and then always
[02:00:44.800 --> 02:00:52.160]  kicking major booty the one the only dr. Nick baggage coming up but I want to go
[02:00:52.160 --> 02:00:55.880]  to this report from OAN from a few days ago I didn't get to it really boils it
[02:00:55.880 --> 02:01:01.080]  down with one of the reporters from Mexico possible standoff room between the
[02:01:01.080 --> 02:01:04.960]  US and Mexico at the border incident and now all this ties together and it goes
[02:01:04.960 --> 02:01:11.520]  the last segment showing the globalist are purposely collapsing our southern border and
[02:01:11.520 --> 02:01:15.320]  I know you know that as an audience but this is really going on this is the
[02:01:15.320 --> 02:01:19.600]  globalist assault to bring down our economy to bring down our system to send
[02:01:19.600 --> 02:01:24.480]  the most uneducated the most underpaid you know the most unskilled the most
[02:01:24.480 --> 02:01:28.680]  diseased here to bring down our nation then we'll come back and I'll blitz through
[02:01:28.680 --> 02:01:33.520]  these stories and then we will get to the Eric Boling extremely powerful and
[02:01:33.520 --> 02:01:38.200]  informative interview all here and info wars and again I want to thank the
[02:01:38.200 --> 02:01:41.560]  audience I want to praise the audience but I also want to beg the audience I
[02:01:41.560 --> 02:01:46.200]  am in your hands without you we do not continue to operate here is the report
[02:01:46.200 --> 02:01:50.920]  well meantime Mexican president Andres Manuel Lopez overdore is speaking out
[02:01:50.920 --> 02:01:54.880]  in the wake of a military incident at the US border one America's Christian
[02:01:54.880 --> 02:02:02.400]  Rhodes looks into the matter the immigration crisis at the US Mexico
[02:02:02.400 --> 02:02:06.520]  border is threatening to escalate into a full-scale standoff between the two
[02:02:06.520 --> 02:02:11.080]  countries in a fiery exchange Wednesday President Trump and Mexican president
[02:02:11.080 --> 02:02:16.600]  Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador expressed outrage over a border incident that
[02:02:16.600 --> 02:02:22.160]  reportedly took place on April the 13th President Trump accused Mexican soldiers
[02:02:22.160 --> 02:02:27.280]  of pointing guns at US National Guardsmen working to secure the border in Texas
[02:02:27.280 --> 02:02:35.320]  a claim dismissed by Lopez Obrador as a provocation we are going to analyze this
[02:02:35.320 --> 02:02:39.320]  incident we will take into account what he is pointing out and will act in
[02:02:39.320 --> 02:02:43.000]  accordance with the law within the framework of our sovereignty however
[02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:47.880]  the Mexican president did not deny the incident took place he said Mexico will
[02:02:47.880 --> 02:02:52.080]  take every effort to protect its sovereignty amidst the ongoing dispute
[02:02:52.080 --> 02:02:56.680]  over migrant caravans from Central America the US wants to keep the migrants
[02:02:56.680 --> 02:03:01.600]  in Mexico while Mexico has sought to quickly transfer them to the US or more
[02:03:01.600 --> 02:03:05.880]  recently deport members of caravans to their countries of origin in this
[02:03:05.880 --> 02:03:10.480]  light Mexico isn't quite as excited over tighter security at the US border either
[02:03:10.480 --> 02:03:16.160]  as this would keep thousands of raging migrants in Mexico Mexico can stop them
[02:03:16.160 --> 02:03:20.680]  if they want we're going to tariff the cars and I will do it just like you know
[02:03:20.680 --> 02:03:25.360]  I will do it I don't play games I'll do it so we're doing it to stop people
[02:03:25.360 --> 02:03:30.560]  despite this latest sign of rain ties there is too much at stake for Mexico to
[02:03:30.560 --> 02:03:35.880]  risk a full-scale confrontation with the US the US MCA trade accord appears to
[02:03:35.880 --> 02:03:39.680]  have been the main reason Mexico has ramped up its crackdown on migrant
[02:03:39.680 --> 02:03:45.480]  caravans over the past few weeks Mexican authorities deported up to 500 migrants
[02:03:45.480 --> 02:03:50.360]  recently and closed several highways but president Trump says this is not
[02:03:50.360 --> 02:03:56.960]  enough as at least 20,000 more migrants are still coming this time on trains still
[02:03:56.960 --> 02:04:00.760]  lock us over to our highlighters the importance of maintaining good relations
[02:04:00.760 --> 02:04:08.240]  with the US we are not going to fight with the United States government the
[02:04:08.240 --> 02:04:12.640]  most important thing is to say that we want a relationship of mutual respect
[02:04:12.640 --> 02:04:17.920]  cooperation and development however his policies fall short from backing up that
[02:04:17.920 --> 02:04:22.120]  claim the Mexican president has previously said his country will continue to
[02:04:22.120 --> 02:04:26.440]  help migrants get to the US and voiced opposition to president Trump's plans to
[02:04:26.440 --> 02:04:31.840]  close the border I'm gonna have to call up one military but our military don't
[02:04:31.840 --> 02:04:36.760]  forget can't act like a military would act because if they got a little rough
[02:04:36.760 --> 02:04:41.600]  everybody would go crazy but president Trump says US troops working at the
[02:04:41.600 --> 02:04:46.440]  border will now be armed in a clear warning to Mexico against trying to
[02:04:46.440 --> 02:04:51.080]  disrupt their activity in this light Mexico finds itself under a rising
[02:04:51.080 --> 02:04:57.360]  pressure to tackle the issue of caravans once well I've got some really good
[02:04:57.360 --> 02:05:00.320]  news for all the viewers and all the listeners this was going to be a big
[02:05:00.320 --> 02:05:03.200]  loss because we couldn't get the deep earth crystals anymore 20 year and a
[02:05:03.200 --> 02:05:06.480]  half fight but we have the original producer the original crystal source
[02:05:06.480 --> 02:05:11.960]  the best atomic out of the world x2 is back got it this deal just happened
[02:05:11.960 --> 02:05:15.760]  about a month ago we rushed it into production it's been bottled the labels
[02:05:15.760 --> 02:05:19.880]  are being put on today and then it's going to be on an 18-wheeler right here
[02:05:19.880 --> 02:05:24.480]  to Austin from the plant in the Rockies and it's gonna be shipped out to you be

[02:05:56.360 --> 02:06:16.480]  you are listening to an infowarstore.com frontline report it's Alex Jones
[02:06:16.480 --> 02:06:29.080]  all right let me jump in to all this news
[02:06:32.640 --> 02:06:36.480]  there's so much a problem it's not a lot of people say oh there's not enough
[02:06:36.480 --> 02:06:43.720]  news there's always too much incredible news going on this planet to have any
[02:06:43.720 --> 02:06:49.240]  problem with not having enough news it's it's the opposite here I want to hit two
[02:06:49.240 --> 02:06:54.000]  big issues right now these are the big Eric Bowling interview that is very very
[02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:57.920]  touching especially at the front of it and it's very very serious but this guy's
[02:06:57.920 --> 02:07:00.760]  good friends with Trump has dinner with him all the time and hangs out the
[02:07:00.760 --> 02:07:03.280]  White House with him they're good friends for a long time before he was
[02:07:03.280 --> 02:07:08.280]  president and he's got a lot of the inside baseball just leaving it at that
[02:07:08.280 --> 02:07:12.480]  and I was able to ask him I said so I've talked to this reporter and this
[02:07:12.480 --> 02:07:15.480]  person that person that just ripped the local office and private meetings of
[02:07:15.480 --> 02:07:18.640]  the president and they said it's not a secret they can talk about it but they've
[02:07:18.640 --> 02:07:23.040]  chosen not to because the heat they'll get but he intends to indict the deep
[02:07:23.040 --> 02:07:30.720]  state and go to war and he said no that's it he intends to do it so there's a
[02:07:30.720 --> 02:07:37.280]  lot going on ladies and gentlemen a lot going on but let me just point this out
[02:07:37.280 --> 02:07:43.160]  everybody from Kit Daniels to Paul Joseph Watson to a Don Salazar to
[02:07:43.160 --> 02:07:53.280]  Kellan McBrain to Jamie White to Ben sometimes I want to plug our riders
[02:07:53.280 --> 02:07:56.440]  as they get attacked when I talk about them on air but they write all these
[02:07:56.440 --> 02:08:05.000]  incredible stories you know Dan over Dan Lyman over running Europe Wars calm they
[02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:07.240]  write all these incredible stories so many of which I don't even
[02:08:07.240 --> 02:08:10.000]  time to get to even though they're huge they're breaking they're the most
[02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:14.520]  important that's why it's critical for this work to be seen that you go to
[02:08:14.520 --> 02:08:18.240]  info wars calm and news wars calm that's why without you getting the
[02:08:18.240 --> 02:08:24.120]  information out the establishment wins so I don't just say that every segment to
[02:08:24.120 --> 02:08:29.960]  say that we've changed the world this audience this crew these host we did it
[02:08:29.960 --> 02:08:37.200]  we're the patriots of the globalist wars we're the MVPs we're the team that
[02:08:37.200 --> 02:08:42.600]  keeps winning but let me tell you we're under massive attack just three years
[02:08:42.600 --> 02:08:47.880]  ago four years ago I tell the crew we're very lucky they ignore us and don't
[02:08:47.880 --> 02:08:52.560]  know how big we are or have chosen to ignore us because if either they're
[02:08:52.560 --> 02:08:55.880]  super stupid or they're just trying to ignore us we're moving the ball down
[02:08:55.880 --> 02:08:59.440]  the field we're changing the discussion we're putting out the whole new road map
[02:08:59.440 --> 02:09:03.440]  to bring America back in the world back they finally figured it out and now the
[02:09:03.440 --> 02:09:10.680]  establishment says that so it's not brag it's fact we're the epicenter we're the
[02:09:10.680 --> 02:09:15.640]  center of the earthquake we're the middle of the storm and that means you
[02:09:15.640 --> 02:09:21.240]  the audience and I get chills when I say that because you are the bloodstream
[02:09:21.240 --> 02:09:28.080]  the brains the eyes the guts the skin the will the soul the bones you are the
[02:09:28.080 --> 02:09:34.520]  info war and so when we're under attack you're under attack it's you they fear we
[02:09:34.520 --> 02:09:39.320]  were just able as Max Kaiser said to broker to create a focal point of the
[02:09:39.320 --> 02:09:43.720]  kindling that was already there we got the sparks going when others couldn't you
[02:09:43.720 --> 02:09:46.800]  and I together you could be old you could be young you could be black
[02:09:46.800 --> 02:09:50.480]  Hispanic Asian white you can live in Russia you could live in Mexico you can
[02:09:50.480 --> 02:09:53.520]  live in Brazil you can live in South Africa you can live in Nigeria you can
[02:09:53.520 --> 02:09:56.880]  live in England you can live in Japan you could live in India you could live
[02:09:56.880 --> 02:10:01.040]  anywhere if you want freedom and you don't like liars and you don't want AI
[02:10:01.040 --> 02:10:06.600]  taken over info wars is a place for you so let's get into it right now let's do
[02:10:06.600 --> 02:10:09.760]  it right now it was Friday edition and I'll be back with a special report this
[02:10:09.760 --> 02:10:14.600]  Saturday and another report this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. that we always do live
[02:10:14.600 --> 02:10:19.120]  maybe on Christmas if it falls on the Sunday let me hit this first I could
[02:10:19.120 --> 02:10:23.920]  spend 10 hours on this but I'm gonna give it to you quick and dirty I've been
[02:10:23.920 --> 02:10:29.480]  following for 15 years or more the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter that cost
[02:10:29.480 --> 02:10:33.200]  billions of dollars a piece and when they were first developed then $500
[02:10:33.200 --> 02:10:39.960]  million a piece but the parts the Japanese have their 12 grounded everybody
[02:10:39.960 --> 02:10:44.600]  that buys them the things aren't in the air they're pieces of crap yeah they're
[02:10:44.600 --> 02:10:47.920]  really great planes when they're working but they can't make them work it's
[02:10:47.920 --> 02:10:52.440]  taken over a decade to get them in the air and so the new Secretary Defense the
[02:10:52.440 --> 02:10:56.400]  act of Secretary Defense has been going around saying the jet when it works is a
[02:10:56.400 --> 02:11:01.520]  great jet but it costs 10 times the other better fighters Boeing makes the F-18
[02:11:01.520 --> 02:11:05.520]  and F-15 and he said we need new generations of fighters Boeing is even
[02:11:05.520 --> 02:11:11.640]  really developing one he said we need to do something so they come out and but
[02:11:11.640 --> 02:11:16.360]  and act like he is fighting the other big defense contracting company well I've
[02:11:16.360 --> 02:11:21.200]  been following this forever he's not so they did this big investigation and found
[02:11:21.200 --> 02:11:25.560]  that none of what he supposedly said to generals and to admirals and to the
[02:11:25.560 --> 02:11:30.680]  Air Force people was true they all agree they said that the plane when it's
[02:11:30.680 --> 02:11:34.720]  operating is really amazing but it's like the space shuttle you got to have a
[02:11:34.720 --> 02:11:38.040]  NASA level crew to make one of the damn things work yeah it's a super next
[02:11:38.040 --> 02:11:44.440]  level plane but it it's just not maybe it could shoot down two F-18 Hornets but
[02:11:44.440 --> 02:11:50.040]  you could buy 15 F-18 Hornets train them equip them 15 F-18 Hornets will shoot
[02:11:50.040 --> 02:11:53.920]  six or seven of these down it's and the Chinese are gonna throw a bunch of
[02:11:53.920 --> 02:11:57.720]  stolen tech they got that's older generation against us we'll get our
[02:11:57.720 --> 02:12:04.520]  ass kicked so you read the articles don't reminded me the Democrats this is
[02:12:04.520 --> 02:12:09.720]  NBC news said anonymous report just an anonymous phone call like Brett
[02:12:09.720 --> 02:12:13.040]  Kavanaugh raped me a six-woman call we don't know who she is but they say that
[02:12:13.040 --> 02:12:18.840]  you know you raped her going back to February 7th an attorney from the
[02:12:18.840 --> 02:12:22.680]  Senate Armed Services Committee forwarded an anonymous allegation the
[02:12:22.680 --> 02:12:27.800]  Shanahan the Secretary of Defense tried to force the command on the Marine
[02:12:27.800 --> 02:12:33.680]  Corps General Robert Kneller to buy Boeing FAA teens and threatened to cut
[02:12:33.680 --> 02:12:37.480]  other Air Force programs unless the Air Force he was staffed General David
[02:12:37.480 --> 02:12:43.760]  Goldson supported buying F-15s they went interview them totally made up but
[02:12:43.760 --> 02:12:49.320]  the point is you read this senator Warren got involved just to get Trump
[02:12:49.320 --> 02:12:54.480]  just cuz this guy's pro-trump they just make all this crap up we need to scrap
[02:12:54.480 --> 02:13:00.240]  the F-18 I know foreign governments are buying them I understand all that we
[02:13:00.240 --> 02:13:06.040]  need real weapons that work okay we don't need crap and most of them are
[02:13:06.040 --> 02:13:11.360]  grounded it costs tens of millions of dollars to get them in the air it's
[02:13:11.360 --> 02:13:16.840]  it's not good it's the program is old it's built on what they thought was
[02:13:16.840 --> 02:13:20.560]  cutting-edge cutting-edge technology 15 years ago they keep trying to cobble
[02:13:20.560 --> 02:13:24.640]  new things on to it they need to start over they just throw it in the trash
[02:13:24.640 --> 02:13:30.880]  can that's what needs to happen suddenly the Democrats if you even try to get
[02:13:30.880 --> 02:13:33.920]  good parts for something and say at least the aircraft should be in the air
[02:13:33.920 --> 02:13:39.080]  you're a traitor now moving on President Trump famously tweeted over and over
[02:13:39.080 --> 02:13:42.360]  again that autism is exploding he knows people whose kids have gotten brain
[02:13:42.360 --> 02:13:45.320]  damage after taking vaccines that you should read the inserts that they give
[02:13:45.320 --> 02:13:49.920]  too many too early but under all the measles hysteria from California New
[02:13:49.920 --> 02:13:53.960]  York some colleges declaring quarantine for people that have measles when you
[02:13:53.960 --> 02:13:58.120]  just usually just get a fever and a few spots on you very rarely causes death
[02:13:58.120 --> 02:14:01.280]  walking across the streets more dangerous he came out a tweet and said
[02:14:01.280 --> 02:14:05.560]  everyone needs to take the measles shot Trump you know Baron got brain damage but
[02:14:05.560 --> 02:14:10.920]  came back from it from the MMR shot at 18 months you know all of this they
[02:14:10.920 --> 02:14:14.160]  admitted New York in California it's illegal aliens that are spreading the
[02:14:14.160 --> 02:14:18.280]  measles it's running water it's hygiene that stopped all these things not the
[02:14:18.280 --> 02:14:23.160]  vaccines a lot of people that have had the measles shot are getting it my dad
[02:14:23.160 --> 02:14:26.920]  before he retired as a doctor said everybody he knew that had shingles
[02:14:26.920 --> 02:14:32.680]  had just taken the shot a month before or a week before mr. president Trump says
[02:14:32.680 --> 02:14:36.640]  people have to be vaccinated amid measles outbreak so he's going along with
[02:14:36.640 --> 02:14:40.840]  forced inoculation it sounds like very dangerous earlier he said I'm not saying
[02:14:40.840 --> 02:14:44.560]  to not give vaccines I'm just saying give them small doses over a long period of
[02:14:44.560 --> 02:14:48.840]  time not one massive dose to a child that is the bare minimum that's what
[02:14:48.840 --> 02:14:54.320]  Trump said years ago and he also said again autism is way up it is a serious
[02:14:54.320 --> 02:14:58.040]  problem as we mentioned now he's starting to reverse himself that's not a good
[02:14:58.040 --> 02:15:02.200]  sign but regardless we'll cover it more today on the war room three o'clock

[02:20:03.720 --> 02:20:24.040]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex jones show we're
[02:20:24.040 --> 02:20:28.080]  here with Eric bowling and of course he was very successful in fox news very
[02:20:28.080 --> 02:20:31.600]  successful in wall street before that successful in baseball too right yes a
[02:20:31.600 --> 02:20:36.720]  lot of stuff so so fight the life and you got targeted last year in another
[02:20:36.720 --> 02:20:41.520]  demonization campaign just like Kennedy just like so many others have then either
[02:20:41.520 --> 02:20:47.200]  been removed from air or been smeared but I think more and more the steam is
[02:20:47.200 --> 02:20:51.360]  starting to run out of that because people have seen all the hoaxes all the
[02:20:51.360 --> 02:20:55.960]  frauds like russia gate and jesse small it and the covington kids I really feel
[02:20:55.960 --> 02:21:00.800]  like the country starting to turn around right now oh what's your view of going
[02:21:00.800 --> 02:21:04.880]  through the gauntlet and and then now coming back so successful with
[02:21:04.880 --> 02:21:09.080]  Sinclair and so successful the stuff you're doing with a blaze TV so here's
[02:21:09.080 --> 02:21:14.320]  what happened so yeah there was a big smear campaign it happened I lost my
[02:21:14.320 --> 02:21:19.880]  son simultaneous with that campaign I spent the year trying to recover I
[02:21:19.880 --> 02:21:24.360]  started to come back Sinclair was good enough to bring me on blaze was good
[02:21:24.360 --> 02:21:27.760]  enough to bring me on I started a new show in Sinclair that was going national
[02:21:27.760 --> 02:21:32.440]  it's across the country 200 stations the first week of that show I was at the
[02:21:32.440 --> 02:21:37.520]  Trump Hotel having a cocktail with six friends two of them were from Cal Berkeley
[02:21:37.520 --> 02:21:43.120]  the kid who got punched for wearing a mug a hat as I'm re-entering the media
[02:21:43.120 --> 02:21:48.440]  world on a substantial level a guy walks through the hotel lobby on a cell
[02:21:48.440 --> 02:21:52.800]  phone it says to me turns around to my table and says Eric bowling son killed
[02:21:52.800 --> 02:21:56.320]  himself because he was embarrassed about his father now my son didn't kill
[02:21:56.320 --> 02:22:02.000]  himself he died accidentally with an open overdose but what that was was the
[02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:06.600]  left trying to get me to do something I followed the guy outside I had to wear
[02:22:06.600 --> 02:22:10.840]  with all the start videotaping myself all I wanted to do was punch that guy in
[02:22:10.840 --> 02:22:14.040]  the face and that's what they wanted me to do turns out there was a second guy
[02:22:14.040 --> 02:22:18.240]  videotaping the whole incident waiting for me to punch that guy because he said
[02:22:18.240 --> 02:22:22.920]  some other nasty things on the way I didn't punch him in the face luckily
[02:22:22.920 --> 02:22:26.880]  because I wouldn't be back on TV now had I done that but Alex you're right
[02:22:26.880 --> 02:22:31.920]  there's a there's a campaign on the left to try and take down higher-profile
[02:22:31.920 --> 02:22:35.960]  conservative voices Eric since you've experienced that you've experienced what
[02:22:35.960 --> 02:22:39.760]  I've experienced obviously not the level you went through with your son at that
[02:22:39.760 --> 02:22:43.000]  four children that's just obvious nightmare that I can't even imagine but
[02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:47.040]  the way they set you up they've done this to me over and over and over again
[02:22:47.040 --> 02:22:51.360]  here in DC but also in Austin I'll be in a restaurant and somebody will walk
[02:22:51.360 --> 02:22:55.880]  over and knock my glass over or say you're gonna die I'm gonna get you it
[02:22:55.880 --> 02:22:59.760]  just happened like a month ago in Austin at Lucy's fried chicken he did at the
[02:22:59.760 --> 02:23:02.680]  second time I called the manager I said please go out they're outside of the
[02:23:02.680 --> 02:23:05.960]  table they're gonna probably confront me again I go outside they're going you're
[02:23:05.960 --> 02:23:11.000]  gonna die f you chanting you know die I have to walk by the guy and this whole
[02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:15.160]  group like seven people and then I search screaming at them going f you they
[02:23:15.160 --> 02:23:18.200]  edit the tape put it on red it gets like 10 million views it becomes a
[02:23:18.200 --> 02:23:22.240]  national story the statesman though which is liberal center reporter they
[02:23:22.240 --> 02:23:25.800]  talked to managers and they said no mr. Jones wasn't thrown out he was leaving
[02:23:25.800 --> 02:23:29.840]  they were thrown out and they did harass him and they set him up but that but
[02:23:29.840 --> 02:23:35.320]  those were just normal Democrats now with their phones are their
[02:23:35.320 --> 02:23:38.720]  constituents are so corrupt and I know a Trump hotel those are probably reporters
[02:23:38.720 --> 02:23:41.840]  trying to set you up they're swarming in there but this is just regular folks
[02:23:41.840 --> 02:23:46.400]  no now they're not I think it's worse than reporters I think this was a a left
[02:23:46.400 --> 02:23:51.720]  wing group that wanted me out of the 2020 campaign they didn't want me
[02:23:51.720 --> 02:23:56.400]  commenting on the president and they know it was a hit it was a hit oh it
[02:23:56.400 --> 02:23:59.720]  had to be because the guy said the most atrocious thing you could say if he had
[02:23:59.720 --> 02:24:04.960]  said I was you know hideous a murderer or rapist whatever I would have let him
[02:24:04.960 --> 02:24:08.840]  go walk by but he said the one thing that would elicit a response from me
[02:24:08.840 --> 02:24:13.040]  claiming my son killed he he didn't he's my best friend my son was my best friend
[02:24:13.040 --> 02:24:17.520]  it was so hurtful I got up and I was infuriated all I wanted to do was hit the
[02:24:17.520 --> 02:24:22.040]  guy he kept looking back at me he kept smiling smiling I have it on tape the
[02:24:22.040 --> 02:24:25.640]  smartest thing I ever did was start rolling on on that incident had I not
[02:24:25.640 --> 02:24:28.360]  rolled on it they could have said I did anything that's what I'm saying is there
[02:24:28.360 --> 02:24:31.880]  was a second cameraman behind which no one even knew about until later so I
[02:24:31.880 --> 02:24:35.640]  rolled on it and I saw and the smiles the smirks on their face they were
[02:24:35.640 --> 02:24:39.320]  begging for me to hit him I didn't thank God I didn't because I wouldn't be here
[02:24:39.320 --> 02:24:44.120]  right now we I would be back in South Carolina going oh you know I came close
[02:24:44.120 --> 02:24:48.320]  to the to the recovery and that's my point is that was a professional hit
[02:24:48.320 --> 02:24:52.880]  guys on you exactly but average Democrats now are trying to set
[02:24:52.880 --> 02:24:56.840]  conservatives up and it happens all the time and I'm wondering as a party or as
[02:24:56.840 --> 02:25:01.480]  a group why they're using basically intelligence agency dirty trick tactics
[02:25:01.480 --> 02:25:05.000]  what were they always this matter what if they turned into I don't think they've
[02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:09.680]  we've hit a new low I think we've hit a new low in the debate in America they'll
[02:25:09.680 --> 02:25:13.720]  they're willing to go after you know kids have been always off off limits you
[02:25:13.720 --> 02:25:16.480]  can go after someone you can go after their policy you can go after their
[02:25:16.480 --> 02:25:20.480]  looks what they wear but you always left the children of the people or the
[02:25:20.480 --> 02:25:24.720]  entities of the media or the politicians alone they've stooped at at least in my
[02:25:24.720 --> 02:25:29.080]  book they've made new new atrocious loves
[02:25:29.080 --> 02:25:35.000]  we're here at the US Capitol on the steps of freedom democracy liberty right
[02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:40.600]  there Alex thanks for joining us again now you're in town for a couple of
[02:25:40.600 --> 02:25:43.320]  reasons but we have some really interesting tape that we're gonna roll
[02:25:43.320 --> 02:25:47.240]  in and talk about in a minute what are you here for I'm here to try to bring
[02:25:47.240 --> 02:25:51.400]  attention to the fact that big tech has been caught lying all the major
[02:25:51.400 --> 02:25:55.080]  companies all four of them to Congress to the president with the four companies
[02:25:55.080 --> 02:25:59.200]  let's just that we've got Google we've got Apple we've got Facebook and we've
[02:25:59.200 --> 02:26:02.040]  got Twitter and of course you think up their sub companies like YouTube of
[02:26:02.040 --> 02:26:05.880]  Google right so you happen to be at the White House yesterday with a bullhorn
[02:26:05.880 --> 02:26:09.680]  yelling into the White House what were you asking for well I was there as a
[02:26:09.680 --> 02:26:13.120]  fan of the president as a big supporter and he's obviously talked a lot about
[02:26:13.120 --> 02:26:15.920]  the censorship that's going on and the fact that CEOs have been caught on
[02:26:15.920 --> 02:26:20.640]  internal videos at Google saying well since Hillary lost we won't let
[02:26:20.640 --> 02:26:24.640]  Democrats lose next time we're gonna shut down these conservatives so we have
[02:26:24.640 --> 02:26:27.760]  them and we have the internal documents and so every time he has these meetings
[02:26:27.760 --> 02:26:30.880]  with them they just lie to his face so I was there bullhorring those facts at the
[02:26:30.880 --> 02:26:34.440]  president bringing up the fact that he needs to bust them up with antitrust
[02:26:34.440 --> 02:26:38.440]  needs to go after him for basically meddling in elections they claim the
[02:26:38.440 --> 02:26:42.720]  Russians meddled with no real proof of that but instead we have big tech totally
[02:26:42.720 --> 02:26:46.840]  on the side of the Democrats and leftists and I didn't even know that there
[02:26:46.840 --> 02:26:50.840]  was an basically a secret unscheduled meeting that wasn't announced till
[02:26:50.840 --> 02:26:55.120]  after it happened with the CEO Jack Norsey of Twitter and literally
[02:26:55.120 --> 02:26:59.280]  synchronicity serendipity whatever you call it planets align that I was
[02:26:59.280 --> 02:27:03.800]  outside for 45 minutes bullhorring while the meeting was going on and I'm
[02:27:03.800 --> 02:27:07.360]  pretty loud a bullhorn reportedly folks can hear some of it inside so here we're
[02:27:07.360 --> 02:27:11.600]  gonna roll in a little tape of you on the bullhorn watch now we have the
[02:27:11.600 --> 02:27:17.040]  evidence of their collusion we have the head of Google saying we're doing this
[02:27:17.040 --> 02:27:23.760]  to stop Trump winning again a lot of Congress president Trump a lot of
[02:27:23.760 --> 02:27:28.640]  Congress president Trump and they say they never censor anybody they never
[02:27:28.640 --> 02:27:36.880]  censor the conservative they never fix the search for an assault and also take
[02:27:36.880 --> 02:27:40.380]  a look at this the president tweeted this picture as you point out with Jack
[02:27:40.380 --> 02:27:43.840]  Dorsey staring directly at the president in the Oval Office he put that
[02:27:43.840 --> 02:27:48.400]  picture up as you were outside bullhorning demanding what again
[02:27:48.400 --> 02:27:53.840]  demanding that we have a real presidential executive but also
[02:27:53.840 --> 02:27:58.440]  congressional investigation of all the incredible proof of Twitter employees
[02:27:58.440 --> 02:28:02.640]  censoring conservatives of Facebook sensory conservatives of Google
[02:28:02.640 --> 02:28:06.760]  executives admitting on video and all these internal manuals that have come
[02:28:06.760 --> 02:28:12.200]  out that name people by name major conservative talk show host saying we
[02:28:12.200 --> 02:28:15.880]  want them shut down there's also statements by Twitter employees and
[02:28:15.880 --> 02:28:19.280]  others who are high-level managers where they're being talked to by project
[02:28:19.280 --> 02:28:24.280]  veritas and they say well who do you censor well American flags and veterans
[02:28:24.280 --> 02:28:27.980]  and stuff like that you know these these stupid rednecks there you'll pro
[02:28:27.980 --> 02:28:32.640]  America and stuff these are quotes and pro-trump they think they're talking to
[02:28:32.640 --> 02:28:36.440]  people but once we shadow ban them they wonder why nobody's talking and they
[02:28:36.440 --> 02:28:39.760]  just get depressed and go away so so shadow banning is where you think you're
[02:28:39.760 --> 02:28:42.760]  talking to people on Twitter you think you're talking to people on Facebook but
[02:28:42.760 --> 02:28:46.360]  they have to either dial you back or they completely shut you down where

[02:32:13.840 --> 02:32:17.560]  that that I trust you know because I've seen a lot of other vitamins they don't
[02:32:17.560 --> 02:32:20.560]  have things that they say that they have in them and they're often not things that
[02:32:20.560 --> 02:32:23.720]  are natural I appreciate that. Well what happened with ultimate female force tell
[02:32:23.720 --> 02:32:26.720]  us about it. Well it's really great you know it's like a multivitamin I take it
[02:32:26.720 --> 02:32:30.200]  it tastes good it doesn't have that nasty aftertaste it actually has kind of a
[02:32:30.200 --> 02:32:33.640]  pleasant aftertaste and you know it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout
[02:32:33.640 --> 02:32:36.760]  the day so I really like it. Well just so you know we look at whatever the best
[02:32:36.760 --> 02:32:40.760]  herbs are they're known to turbo charge women and then we get the organic ones
[02:32:40.760 --> 02:32:46.400]  and put it in it so yeah stamina libido energy these are amazing things and
[02:32:46.400 --> 02:32:48.720]  ultimate female force so I'm glad you plugged it
[02:32:48.720 --> 02:32:54.800]  info or store dot com or triple eight two five three three one three nine
[02:32:58.360 --> 02:33:03.840]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[02:33:03.840 --> 02:33:17.960]  certainly for some Alex Jones can be scary and abrasive
[02:33:25.960 --> 02:33:30.760]  but if you can get through all that to explore what he's been saying to see for
[02:33:30.760 --> 02:33:35.320]  yourself what it is that the establishment wants to hide from the
[02:33:35.320 --> 02:33:42.480]  information you find could be life-changing he predicted 9-11 and if
[02:33:42.480 --> 02:33:46.000]  there was an outside threat like a bin lot who was a known CIA asset in the
[02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:50.040]  eighties he's the boogeyman they need this or welly and phony system he
[02:33:50.040 --> 02:33:55.720]  exposed the cremation of care ceremony at bohemian grove
[02:33:55.720 --> 02:34:05.200]  we educated us about the relationship between the third Reich and modern
[02:34:05.200 --> 02:34:10.080]  globalist prison planet dominated by a ruthless gang of control freaks he
[02:34:10.080 --> 02:34:18.920]  helped reveal the so-called Bilderberg group at all he was the loudest voice
[02:34:18.920 --> 02:34:26.040]  reporting on the union between the communist Chinese and Silicon Valley they
[02:34:26.040 --> 02:34:34.440]  falsely edit him they lie about his reporting of Sandy Hook they lie that
[02:34:34.440 --> 02:34:42.160]  he pushed a child down in a viral video and now he is being de-platformed by
[02:34:42.160 --> 02:34:48.000]  Facebook Apple and Google private companies are being harassed and
[02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:51.960]  encouraged to stop doing business with him and then we get hit say you no longer
[02:34:51.960 --> 02:34:57.600]  use our software youtubers are being censored for talking about him we just
[02:34:57.600 --> 02:35:02.160]  got taken down by YouTube they just killed her stream really yep and some
[02:35:02.160 --> 02:35:10.960]  Americans are actually celebrating this this is America in 2018 will you sit by
[02:35:10.960 --> 02:35:18.040]  and allow liberty and freedom to be taken away right before your eyes will
[02:35:18.040 --> 02:35:25.720]  you do nothing while history is being recorded will you sit and do nothing or
[02:35:25.720 --> 02:35:33.240]  will you do your own research discover the truth and stand for freedom crashing
[02:35:33.240 --> 02:36:01.240]  through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones
[02:36:01.240 --> 02:36:07.320]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance explain this to me
[02:36:07.320 --> 02:36:10.960]  and we we're gonna pull my Twitter and Facebook I started Twitter and Facebook
[02:36:10.960 --> 02:36:14.800]  around the same time I was in the media at the time just starting out in the
[02:36:14.800 --> 02:36:19.560]  media so over the course of the first few years I ran neck and neck Twitter and
[02:36:19.560 --> 02:36:24.880]  Facebook follows were tracking evenly I got to about 500,000 of each maybe three
[02:36:24.880 --> 02:36:29.320]  years ago two and a half three years ago at that point for some reason Twitter
[02:36:29.320 --> 02:36:34.320]  kept going I'm now at 1.1 million on Twitter but my Facebook plateaued at
[02:36:34.320 --> 02:36:39.040]  550,000 and hasn't gone up in years that's a shadow banning explain how that
[02:36:39.040 --> 02:36:43.200]  works three years ago we were in the heat of the 2016 election they started to
[02:36:43.200 --> 02:36:46.680]  get scared that Hillary might lose from internal polls that big tech was
[02:36:46.680 --> 02:36:50.600]  actually providing to her that came out and so they started governing back not
[02:36:50.600 --> 02:36:55.280]  completely shadow banning but dialing people back about 90% and later algorithms
[02:36:55.280 --> 02:36:57.560]  were released that all the big tech companies were working together and
[02:36:57.560 --> 02:37:02.120]  dialing people back even the month before the election 90% then when Hillary
[02:37:02.120 --> 02:37:05.640]  lost they panicked and completely shadow banned a lot of people on Facebook
[02:37:05.640 --> 02:37:09.200]  Twitter was a little more open for a while and that's why you were able to
[02:37:09.200 --> 02:37:12.560]  keep growing but now from all the evidence we've seen they started to act
[02:37:12.560 --> 02:37:16.920]  just like Facebook and just like Google but the main leader of this is Google
[02:37:16.920 --> 02:37:21.560]  when it comes to massive control because they have 93% of global searches
[02:37:21.560 --> 02:37:24.960]  they're really able to manipulate control how do they do that there's
[02:37:24.960 --> 02:37:28.920]  thousands of ways but just remember last year they listed in the 2018 election
[02:37:28.920 --> 02:37:33.480]  all Republicans in the state of California as Nazis it said Republican
[02:37:33.480 --> 02:37:38.960]  party political affiliation Nazi party Google officially put that up here's
[02:37:38.960 --> 02:37:41.720]  another way they censor they don't recognize any Christian holidays they've
[02:37:41.720 --> 02:37:44.920]  taken Easter down but they have that little doodle at the top of Google
[02:37:44.920 --> 02:37:48.560]  that'll promote any leftist organization or group but then there's more serious
[02:37:48.560 --> 02:37:52.280]  ways it's the search results used to under their algorithm whatever was most
[02:37:52.280 --> 02:37:56.800]  popular was pushed to the top that's all we were popular now they handpick on
[02:37:56.800 --> 02:38:00.560]  key political things what they want to force feed even came out 2016 that
[02:38:00.560 --> 02:38:04.840]  anything negative about Hillary was being buried and so they started off
[02:38:04.840 --> 02:38:08.960]  protecting her now they're doing it to two thousands and thousands of different
[02:38:08.960 --> 02:38:13.280]  topics and different names I'll give you an example I interviewed the president
[02:38:13.280 --> 02:38:18.560]  two weeks ago my Facebook follows have gone down since I've gone down going
[02:38:18.560 --> 02:38:22.120]  negative by several hundred since I interviewed the president meanwhile
[02:38:22.120 --> 02:38:25.920]  Twitter keeps growing how in the world could that possibly be happening for
[02:38:25.920 --> 02:38:30.600]  years it's gone consistently up and I start interviewing or you know putting
[02:38:30.600 --> 02:38:34.480]  up content that's friendly to the president and it goes down you're being
[02:38:34.480 --> 02:38:38.680]  targeted a thousand percent every time you're a threat to the Democratic Party
[02:38:38.680 --> 02:38:43.280]  and the swamp every time you have a big hit interview this happens to everybody
[02:38:43.280 --> 02:38:47.480]  that's when you get shadow band or outright band and you keep getting so
[02:38:47.480 --> 02:38:50.640]  successful they're going to just completely ban you so Facebook is
[02:38:50.640 --> 02:38:54.440]  actually taking my account saying he's too close to the president he's putting
[02:38:54.440 --> 02:38:58.800]  up content we disagree with I mean this is that anti-free speech well Eric I'm
[02:38:58.800 --> 02:39:01.160]  not just saying this everyone knows you got targeted with all that
[02:39:01.160 --> 02:39:06.320]  disinformation last year because you are friends with the president and you were
[02:39:06.320 --> 02:39:10.600]  already super popular and rising to the top they don't want another Sean Hannity
[02:39:10.600 --> 02:39:14.360]  they don't want another person at that level so they're basically
[02:39:14.360 --> 02:39:18.320]  suppressing you but you're fighting back so they're suppressing you even more
[02:39:18.320 --> 02:39:22.640]  what are you doing now you've been you've been banned on Twitter is it still
[02:39:22.640 --> 02:39:26.760]  in fact yes I'm a lifetime ban in their words I mean murderers get out in 20
[02:39:26.760 --> 02:39:33.040]  years lifetime ban the Google has restricted me total ban on Apple we
[02:39:33.040 --> 02:39:37.280]  had over 40 million subscribers on Apple that was our biggest thing with my
[02:39:37.280 --> 02:39:41.360]  three podcasts those were all banned it took me like 15 years to build that up
[02:39:41.360 --> 02:39:46.000]  that was all just blown away in one day Tim Cook actually led the banning in
[02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:50.120]  August of last year about nine months ago he led the phone call the other big
[02:39:50.120 --> 02:39:54.840]  tech heads on a Sunday night and then at 3 a.m. on that Monday morning I was banned
[02:39:54.840 --> 02:40:00.200]  on six major platforms more than 80 more platforms followed including software
[02:40:00.200 --> 02:40:05.120]  companies what are they saying Alex why are they banning you they they made up
[02:40:05.120 --> 02:40:09.880]  all this incredible garbage first they said that I said no one died at the
[02:40:09.880 --> 02:40:14.440]  Florida shootings that year in February never said that offered a million
[02:40:14.440 --> 02:40:18.440]  dollar reward I never said that never said that they were crisis actors there
[02:40:18.440 --> 02:40:24.120]  in Florida at the tragic shooting Parkland you mark Parkland but even if I
[02:40:24.120 --> 02:40:28.680]  was a crazy person and said the moon was made out of cheese and nobody died there
[02:40:28.680 --> 02:40:32.600]  which I didn't say it should be my right to but instead they said oh my god he
[02:40:32.600 --> 02:40:35.680]  said all these bad things about these kids mixing Sandy Hook in whether which
[02:40:35.680 --> 02:40:39.840]  was also twisted and so again that's how they got me off there they also said
[02:40:39.840 --> 02:40:44.960]  that I quote endangered a child and they show the clip it was all the news of
[02:40:44.960 --> 02:40:48.960]  that 10-year-old kid hitting that guy he pushes the kid down Forbes and others
[02:40:48.960 --> 02:40:53.040]  you pull it up how to do a retraction they said that that was me pushing a
[02:40:53.040 --> 02:40:57.440]  kid down so they found a video on YouTube from a year before of some guy
[02:40:57.440 --> 02:41:00.640]  pushing a kid down that hitting that had been all over the news they said that
[02:41:00.640 --> 02:41:04.560]  was me and that was the final strike that they made the excuse and that wasn't
[02:41:04.560 --> 02:41:10.080]  you wasn't even me right financially they hurt you badly can you sue them for
[02:41:10.080 --> 02:41:15.040]  that I mean is it a free speech argument by the way Alex let's be honest I
[02:41:15.040 --> 02:41:18.640]  disagree with you on a lot of things sure some of the things that that you've
[02:41:18.640 --> 02:41:23.000]  said in the past 9-11 the inside job that the Sandy Hook stuff wherever you are
[02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:26.440]  on it I I've disagreed with you by I feel you have a right to say whatever you
[02:41:26.440 --> 02:41:30.480]  want whenever you want no matter how much I agree with your disagree with you
[02:41:30.480 --> 02:41:33.360]  well that's a great point one thing they do though they've done this to you and
[02:41:33.360 --> 02:41:37.480]  others is they take something they twist it then they make that your identity so
[02:41:37.480 --> 02:41:40.760]  on so many of those issues they distorted what I said about 9-11 they
[02:41:40.760 --> 02:41:44.760]  distorted what I said about Sandy Hook and then they said that I said that lie
[02:41:44.760 --> 02:41:50.320]  about Parkland and banned me when you say they who's they all the major corporate
[02:41:50.320 --> 02:41:55.080]  establishment media all of those systems band together with the same talking
[02:41:55.080 --> 02:41:59.760]  points and then they gang up on one personality destroy them and then move
[02:41:59.760 --> 02:42:03.520]  on to the next person and yes where Congress and the president and the courts
[02:42:03.520 --> 02:42:08.240]  and citizens can take action is the tortuous interference it's the big tech
[02:42:08.240 --> 02:42:12.240]  monopolies coordinating to form oligopolies even the EU courts have
[02:42:12.240 --> 02:42:17.520]  ruled that to then go in and control the market and target people they don't like
[02:42:17.520 --> 02:42:22.480]  so it's the real collusion by big tech to bring in this Democratic Party
[02:42:22.480 --> 02:42:26.600]  dictatorship basically with the deep state and overthrow the president and
[02:42:26.600 --> 02:42:30.160]  overthrow the election so that's what this is is big tech allied with the
[02:42:30.160 --> 02:42:35.400]  communist Chinese and others I mean Google and Apple have moved to China and
[02:42:35.400 --> 02:42:40.280]  Apple officially is on record saying they will accept a dictatorship anywhere
[02:42:40.280 --> 02:42:44.760]  in the world Tim Cook gave a speech in Beijing three years ago where he said I
[02:42:44.760 --> 02:42:50.000]  will accept censorship and I will accept dictatorship he anybody can pull this up
[02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:56.280]  it is incredible and now they're helping Apple and Google build brainforce plus

[02:46:18.760 --> 02:46:21.880]  the full effect the fish oil and the children's are really strong they don't
[02:46:21.880 --> 02:46:25.080]  give you the burpees but krill oils is the best and it'll give you the damn
[02:46:25.080 --> 02:46:28.280]  burps and I'm sorry you want something like this you don't get stuff for free
[02:46:28.280 --> 02:46:32.280]  the krill is hallucinogenic it's so good in my view I'm not a medical
[02:46:32.280 --> 02:46:35.280]  statement here but let me tell you something I eat five campelets of
[02:46:35.280 --> 02:46:41.320]  krill oil before I go to bed I'm seeing Santa Claus that night so your brain is
[02:46:41.320 --> 02:46:49.440]  made basically out of what fish oil is so we don't make a big profit off of it
[02:46:49.440 --> 02:46:52.560]  but you know as I just obsessed because whatever the best is we've got I just
[02:46:52.560 --> 02:46:56.280]  can't lie to you I just can't do it
[02:46:56.280 --> 02:47:03.680]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:47:10.480 --> 02:47:18.280]  the most banned network in the world they're helping Apple and Google build
[02:47:18.280 --> 02:47:22.320]  all these surveillance grids in communist China and help suppress I am just
[02:47:22.320 --> 02:47:27.160]  sitting here brainstorming as we talk you know Apple Google Facebook and Twitter
[02:47:27.160 --> 02:47:31.360]  couldn't get together they couldn't merge as a business entity there'd be
[02:47:31.360 --> 02:47:35.160]  antitrust they'd be too big why in the world would they be able to get gang up
[02:47:35.160 --> 02:47:39.720]  and merge against some a business or private citizen like you or the
[02:47:39.720 --> 02:47:44.320]  Republican Party CC that's bingo right there bingo or the Republican Party or
[02:47:44.320 --> 02:47:47.400]  a president or any other corporation they want to shut down that's it it's a
[02:47:47.400 --> 02:47:53.080]  cartel monopoly oligopoly and oligopoly is a group of monopolies joining forces
[02:47:53.080 --> 02:47:57.120]  to take over the entire system so it's not just a monopoly over the phones or
[02:47:57.120 --> 02:48:01.080]  monopoly over the water in your town or monopoly over the cable or monopoly over
[02:48:01.080 --> 02:48:04.520]  the grocery store those are all bad when they join forces they're called cartels
[02:48:04.520 --> 02:48:09.840]  or oligopolies and so we have criminal mega cartels the biggest the world's
[02:48:09.840 --> 02:48:15.520]  ever seen completely censoring and dialing back and governing in the
[02:48:15.520 --> 02:48:18.600]  classic sense what people can say and that's how they can be stopped and the
[02:48:18.600 --> 02:48:23.240]  other thing is Alex and in look I'm I'm sure something is going on in my
[02:48:23.240 --> 02:48:27.840]  Facebook I'm positive it just I'm a statistical animal I love statistics I
[02:48:27.840 --> 02:48:30.600]  eat in my drink in my sleep I wake up in the middle of night calling my
[02:48:30.600 --> 02:48:34.480]  producers about statistics there's no physical well there's no logical way
[02:48:34.480 --> 02:48:37.840]  this could be happening with my Twitter versus my Facebook they must be doing
[02:48:37.840 --> 02:48:41.560]  something but here's what we tend to do if they remove the governor if they
[02:48:41.560 --> 02:48:45.960]  remove the thumb on on the scale then we're happy we move on we don't call
[02:48:45.960 --> 02:48:48.880]  them out on it you're doing something different well that's exactly what
[02:48:48.880 --> 02:48:52.720]  happened in the last decade we went from 90% of the web being a little websites
[02:48:52.720 --> 02:48:56.320]  and we surfed the web to 90 plus percent of traffic being on only four
[02:48:56.320 --> 02:48:59.840]  platforms and now instead of us directing the web for what we want
[02:48:59.840 --> 02:49:04.280]  they're making the web direct us and controlling us and we can't just you
[02:49:04.280 --> 02:49:07.800]  sit there and be happy these monopolies are dangerous even if they weren't
[02:49:07.800 --> 02:49:11.800]  abusing their authority it's unamerican it's dangerous but of course they
[02:49:11.800 --> 02:49:16.440]  always abuse their monopolies and now they're going from monopoly to cartel
[02:49:16.440 --> 02:49:20.080]  oligopoly which is the final stage so we watch them when they do it in the
[02:49:20.080 --> 02:49:23.400]  business world we watch if they get too big then you know AT&T gets broken up
[02:49:23.400 --> 02:49:27.920]  it maybe they're at that size critical mass for the business side now they
[02:49:27.920 --> 02:49:32.320]  want to get into news though now if they want to be a cartel and they want to be
[02:49:32.320 --> 02:49:36.360]  the purveyors of news in America that's where it gets anti first amendment free
[02:49:36.360 --> 02:49:39.800]  speech because they might control too much of the media it's incredibly dangerous
[02:49:39.800 --> 02:49:43.800]  and if you hit the nail directly on the head and this is the debate we have to
[02:49:43.800 --> 02:49:46.700]  start sure corporations can hire and fire whoever they want
[02:49:46.700 --> 02:49:49.600]  corporations can have their corporate culture as long as it doesn't violate
[02:49:49.600 --> 02:49:54.000]  people's civil rights but when they all band together as Silicon Valley admits
[02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:57.800]  they do right after I got banned and they were trying to get the final group to
[02:49:57.800 --> 02:50:02.120]  ban me Twitter Jack Dorsey had a meeting with all the tech heads at the Twitter
[02:50:02.120 --> 02:50:05.880]  headquarters in San Francisco and it came out in Buzzfeed that they were
[02:50:05.880 --> 02:50:11.120]  deciding how to control conservatives and how to manipulate the 2018 election so
[02:50:11.120 --> 02:50:14.440]  so they're so arrogant they lie to Congress and say we've never censored
[02:50:14.440 --> 02:50:19.020]  we've never gained results we've never done anything that's the head of Google
[02:50:19.020 --> 02:50:22.880]  Sundar Pachai and all the rest of them and then they're writing in their own
[02:50:22.880 --> 02:50:26.400]  leftist publications that they're gonna censor people what two years ago Jack
[02:50:26.400 --> 02:50:32.200]  Dorsey said I don't see how we can be objective in big tech we're in a war he
[02:50:32.200 --> 02:50:35.480]  tweeted an article about how we're in a war against conservatives and have to
[02:50:35.480 --> 02:50:39.280]  shut them down well he's clearly on it on a conservative outreach tour right now
[02:50:39.280 --> 02:50:43.160]  he sat with the president I've been asked that when we sit down and talk to
[02:50:43.160 --> 02:50:47.760]  Jack of course we would he is trying to reach out maybe to clean up some of the
[02:50:47.760 --> 02:50:50.560]  mess that that was of the last year you're talking about because they got
[02:50:50.560 --> 02:50:55.440]  caught and because so many of their own employees memos have come out this is a
[02:50:55.440 --> 02:51:02.760]  open and shut case they're all doing it again Google is the ringleader Apple has
[02:51:02.760 --> 02:51:07.320]  literally given the code keys to China so that the Chinese government has all
[02:51:07.320 --> 02:51:10.880]  the Apple codes to everybody's phones this is a national security crisis people
[02:51:10.880 --> 02:51:16.200]  have heard of that big telecom put away hold on let's take a step back I know
[02:51:16.200 --> 02:51:23.600]  you have a thick skin Google has given the Apple has given the codes to get
[02:51:23.600 --> 02:51:27.920]  into my phone to what listen in to take pictures you've you've heard about how
[02:51:27.920 --> 02:51:31.840]  Trump says that Chinese company the second largest 5g is a national security
[02:51:31.840 --> 02:51:35.680]  threat yeah it's state-run it can it can break into everything it can track
[02:51:35.680 --> 02:51:40.800]  everything you're doing they admit it state-run okay it's the same for you to
[02:51:40.800 --> 02:51:47.280]  become a tax exempt company and Apple made the decision early in 2018 you
[02:51:47.280 --> 02:51:52.120]  pull up in Reuters Apple moved officially to China as their new base of
[02:51:52.120 --> 02:51:58.920]  operations no longer Seattle their main headquarters just like Google was in
[02:51:58.920 --> 02:52:02.440]  Ireland to get around taxes they've moved to China because China said if you
[02:52:02.440 --> 02:52:06.320]  become partnered with the state state-run you will get zero percent tax so
[02:52:06.320 --> 02:52:10.440]  when Trump lowered corporate in income tax from 40 to 20 to compete with China's
[02:52:10.440 --> 02:52:16.120]  15 percent China then went to zero if you do a partnership and it's in Reuters
[02:52:16.120 --> 02:52:19.760]  AP but they require you if you want to do business in China you have to
[02:52:19.760 --> 02:52:22.920]  partnership with the Chinese government and so that's why Trump's pissed and so
[02:52:22.920 --> 02:52:27.080]  it was in Reuters I couldn't believe this but then it was an Apple defendant
[02:52:27.080 --> 02:52:30.280]  they said yes this is just how you do business here so the Chinese government
[02:52:30.280 --> 02:52:37.120]  was given access to all of the code keys for all Apple devices for the cloud for
[02:52:37.120 --> 02:52:40.720]  your phones not just here but all around the world you make you making that part
[02:52:40.720 --> 02:52:44.360]  up no no I swear to God you're gonna tell me the Chinese have my code key to
[02:52:44.360 --> 02:52:49.880]  his phone yes listen Chinese Chinese do not hack me or else I'll get Alex on you
[02:52:49.880 --> 02:52:53.360]  hey I'll pop I will pull the Reuters article up for you I believe I will show
[02:52:53.360 --> 02:52:57.000]  you but but I mean you heard about the big 5g so so that's why I'm g by the way
[02:52:57.000 --> 02:53:01.960]  we're on 5g right here in DC that's the rollout rollout is starting in DC and
[02:53:01.960 --> 02:53:05.640]  it's gonna eventually take you know be in many many markets I think 200 markets
[02:53:05.640 --> 02:53:09.640]  and that's American 5g 5g right here that's why they declared national
[02:53:09.640 --> 02:53:12.640]  security crisis over this Chinese state-run company that's the second
[02:53:12.640 --> 02:53:16.640]  largest in the world because they're low they're rolling it out at below cost
[02:53:16.640 --> 02:53:22.960]  again with a monopoly to have a monopoly over the control of our 5g so so
[02:53:22.960 --> 02:53:26.960]  that's why Trump's saying no because it is a monopoly practice of a government to
[02:53:26.960 --> 02:53:30.600]  militarily capture control of our communications grid and be able to break
[02:53:30.600 --> 02:53:34.840]  into everything through the 5g overlay all right all right now we've blown
[02:53:34.840 --> 02:53:38.640]  through over my way over my brain power right now a couple of this new stories
[02:53:38.640 --> 02:53:42.680]  Mueller report give us a day Alex Jones is two cents on what happened with Mueller
[02:53:42.680 --> 02:53:47.880]  where we go from here Mueller the Democrats the deep state McCabe Comey
[02:53:47.880 --> 02:53:51.520]  all of them got directed by Obama and Hillary it came out in the FISA court
[02:53:51.520 --> 02:53:58.880]  warrants two years ago the FISA court put out a report saying hey the fraudulent
[02:53:58.880 --> 02:54:02.560]  hey put her put her on camera what's going over here yeah come on come on talk
[02:54:02.560 --> 02:54:05.600]  to us talk to us I know you have something to say let's go ma'am really
[02:54:05.600 --> 02:54:09.600]  we're friendly you say my wires come on okay but so so but we're gonna say what
[02:54:09.600 --> 02:54:14.280]  the Mueller report is Obama and Hillary knew that Trump was really leading in
[02:54:14.280 --> 02:54:18.360]  polls but they were manipulating him so they started spying on his campaign in
[02:54:18.360 --> 02:54:22.840]  early 2016 some evidence shows even before that they start spying on the
[02:54:22.840 --> 02:54:27.240]  campaign illegally they opened up an international investigation using fraudulent
[02:54:27.240 --> 02:54:31.440]  information they brought to the court the inspector general of the FISA court
[02:54:31.440 --> 02:54:35.760]  went public almost two years ago in a report that no one covered and said we
[02:54:35.760 --> 02:54:39.000]  were given false information there needs to be an investigation of this so
[02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:42.920]  that's two years ago and so Mueller couldn't find anything you couldn't find
[02:54:42.920 --> 02:54:47.000]  any Americans who would take money from their sting operations I'm proud of our
[02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:51.840]  country and so at that point Mueller didn't have any choice and neither did
[02:54:51.840 --> 02:54:56.840]  Barr because Obama and Hillary and all them had had had overreached so far and
[02:54:56.840 --> 02:55:00.440]  committed so many crimes that that now they're the ones that are in trouble and
[02:55:00.440 --> 02:55:04.400]  so they're lucky that that this report kind of came out and whitewash things
[02:55:04.400 --> 02:55:07.840]  for them because if Trump does go after them with all the evidence he has it'll
[02:55:07.840 --> 02:55:11.480]  be the end of the Democratic Party they committed massive crimes and so the
[02:55:11.480 --> 02:55:15.120]  Mueller report if anything is a whitewash of the Democrats attempt to
[02:55:15.120 --> 02:55:18.600]  overthrow an elected president and overthrow the election of the American
[02:55:18.600 --> 02:55:23.280]  people I'm still trying to figure out how they got the FISA warrant to spy on
[02:55:23.280 --> 02:55:28.600]  the Trump campaign was based on a flawed document well and someone has to be
[02:55:28.600 --> 02:55:32.080]  held responsible here's why because it doesn't mean maybe you maybe you love
[02:55:32.080 --> 02:55:35.440]  Trump maybe you hate Trump but maybe Trump would do it too if you're allowed
[02:55:35.440 --> 02:55:41.040]  to go to a FISA court with fake evidence and use it to spy on competition or
[02:55:41.040 --> 02:55:44.000]  someone you don't like called from America it is fraud but but it worse
[02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:48.360]  than fraud it's espionage it's almost treasonous but who did it is it is it
[02:55:48.360 --> 02:55:52.160]  the FISA court that because they allowed it or the people who brought the bad
[02:55:52.160 --> 02:55:56.760]  evidence to the FISA remember just two weeks ago when Trump said there needs
[02:55:56.760 --> 02:56:00.600]  to be criminal action taken against these groups this was a coup this was an
[02:56:00.600 --> 02:56:05.040]  attempted takedown clapper and Brennan both went on CNN yes they did the next
[02:56:05.040 --> 02:56:08.560]  day and said we were ordered by President Obama to do it and they laid out
[02:56:08.560 --> 02:56:13.320]  dates going back to early 2016 and they were saying hey presidential presidential
[02:56:13.320 --> 02:56:18.120]  authority they're scared so so they ran up the white flag and said hey we were
[02:56:18.120 --> 02:56:21.360]  ordered to do this don't indict us there's your proof right there Obama gave
[02:56:21.360 --> 02:56:26.160]  the orders it came from the president and at one point before the report was
[02:56:26.160 --> 02:56:30.480]  released Brennan was on CNN saying there was evidence of collusion with the
[02:56:30.480 --> 02:56:34.000]  Russians but there was never was any evidence they never found how can it
[02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:38.960]  Intel guy inside still has access say there's evidence and there's never been
[02:56:38.960 --> 02:56:42.080]  a drop drop here's how you know the rats are leaving the sense thinking ship
[02:56:42.080 --> 02:56:47.000]  Bob Woodward wrote a book what called fear all about how Trump's this Russian
[02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:54.200]  agent now he's doing an attour on CNN MSNBC saying actually criminal groups in
[02:56:54.200 --> 02:56:57.440]  the CIA and FBI to overthrow the president they need to be criminally
[02:56:57.440 --> 02:57:01.160]  charged needs to be a criminal investigation so he suddenly has run up
[02:57:01.160 --> 02:57:04.560]  the life flag as well because they got caught with their hands in the cookie
[02:57:04.560 --> 02:57:09.040]  jar all right before we go because you seem to have the inside track on a lot

[02:59:53.160 --> 03:00:02.600]  from the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones
[03:00:04.760 --> 03:00:09.800]  but I think it's backfiring on them and I'm sorry that happened to you I've been
[03:00:09.800 --> 03:00:13.160]  using that but look what they've done to the Trump family look at the lies they've
[03:00:13.160 --> 03:00:16.640]  told trying to tear this country apart and now that the Russia hoax has fallen
[03:00:16.640 --> 03:00:20.120]  apart and when we saw people waking up do you think there's any way for the
[03:00:20.120 --> 03:00:23.360]  country to least partially heal or the Democrats is going to keep opening the
[03:00:23.360 --> 03:00:27.600]  ones I think we're we're done we're just we're bifurcating we're gonna keep
[03:00:27.600 --> 03:00:31.120]  going look let's be honest what rates on television what rates on the media what
[03:00:31.120 --> 03:00:35.400]  rates in in politics I mean you can't win being this interest anymore polarization
[03:00:35.400 --> 03:00:39.160]  polarization rates across the board it gets you elected it gets your ratings so
[03:00:39.160 --> 03:00:44.000]  I think we realized until maybe it gets so far the pendulum swings so far that
[03:00:44.000 --> 03:00:47.440]  way it comes back but right now polarization is working well I saw
[03:00:47.440 --> 03:00:50.360]  Trump because the globalists were demonizing even a country existing
[03:00:50.360 --> 03:00:55.000]  polarizing Americans against the left and the globalists that say America was
[03:00:55.000 --> 03:00:58.680]  never great it'll never be great he had to polarize so Americans remembered who
[03:00:58.680 --> 03:01:03.400]  they were but now I've seen him try to be so centrist with prison reform and all
[03:01:03.400 --> 03:01:07.160]  the way he's been reaching out it's so real like JFK level stuff and the left
[03:01:07.160 --> 03:01:11.640]  is just absolutely ignoring it demonizing it when when Trump tries to pull
[03:01:11.640 --> 03:01:16.040]  troops out of countries and national polls the Democrats support staying in
[03:01:16.040 --> 03:01:21.080]  staying in Syria the Democrats support staying in a military conflict or a war
[03:01:21.080 --> 03:01:24.920]  when it's great the world's flipped on it's here but Trump's smart though he
[03:01:24.920 --> 03:01:31.440]  went to prison reform that was one of their whether the central points
[03:01:31.440 --> 03:01:34.720]  tenets of the Democrat Party so he took that away from him he took
[03:01:34.720 --> 03:01:38.080]  infrastructure away from him he took pulling out of foreign wars away from
[03:01:38.080 --> 03:01:43.280]  they don't have anything left but we hate Trump in closing one of their final
[03:01:43.280 --> 03:01:46.480]  big lies I still hear is Trump never really wanted to be elected even though
[03:01:46.480 --> 03:01:49.920]  he campaign harder than anybody in modern history even though he lost hundreds
[03:01:49.920 --> 03:01:53.360]  of millions of dollars of his own money I mean boycott it and his golf courses
[03:01:53.360 --> 03:01:56.040]  attack for everybody I know that knows Trump you know I'm really well and I've
[03:01:56.040 --> 03:01:59.760]  talked to him so I mean he's totally focused working 16 70 an hour is a day
[03:01:59.760 --> 03:02:04.440]  for the country to come back he believes in it and that that hoax I think that he
[03:02:04.440 --> 03:02:07.920]  didn't really want to get elected that's just more more lies can you speak
[03:02:07.920 --> 03:02:11.040]  knowing him really well very well very well he wanted to be elected I don't
[03:02:11.040 --> 03:02:15.000]  think he thought he was going to be elected I'll give them that I think he
[03:02:15.000 --> 03:02:18.840]  was surprised as a lot of people were I wasn't you weren't but I think so the
[03:02:18.840 --> 03:02:22.600]  surprise but it was a pleasant surprise we're all he's happy we're happy and I
[03:02:22.600 --> 03:02:26.760]  know the man definitely wants to get reelected in 2020 does he get reelected
[03:02:26.760 --> 03:02:31.760]  yeah he's like what would you Bernie Sanders who now thinks of murders
[03:02:31.760 --> 03:02:36.960]  terrorists should vote in in presidential elections got Elizabeth Warren the the
[03:02:36.960 --> 03:02:41.680]  female Santa Claus giving away free education AOC says the world's gonna end
[03:02:41.680 --> 03:02:46.800]  AOC 12 years but she can't run she's too young and not smart enough to run now
[03:02:46.800 --> 03:02:50.400]  he wins he wins hands down the only way the only one that would give him a run
[03:02:50.400 --> 03:02:55.240]  for his money would be Michelle Obama and she's not possible you mean Michael
[03:02:55.240 --> 03:03:00.240]  Obama no Michelle Obama it's a joke I know you know they I got fixed in you
[03:03:00.240 --> 03:03:03.080]  know they said that I was the one that said that it was Joan Rivers said she
[03:03:03.080 --> 03:03:08.040]  was a tranny I'm staying out of this I'm Michelle Obama the wife of Barack Obama
[03:03:08.040 --> 03:03:12.560]  tell folks how they find your shows blaze media for blaze TV digital and
[03:03:12.560 --> 03:03:18.400]  every Wednesday Sinclair across the whole country go to your local TV station
[03:03:18.400 --> 03:03:22.480]  local news station a Sinclair on station likely is in your neighborhood
[03:03:22.480 --> 03:03:25.840]  you're just check out our schedule you know I said one last question but that's
[03:03:25.840 --> 03:03:29.480]  too important can you get into because we Sinclair has said that they wanted to
[03:03:29.480 --> 03:03:34.200]  basically take Fox on they tried to do some mergers and speaking of anti-trust
[03:03:34.200 --> 03:03:38.200]  those mergers of them just buying some more TV stations and cable got blocked
[03:03:38.200 --> 03:03:42.840]  which is you know total bull in my view and now obviously there they're gonna go
[03:03:42.840 --> 03:03:47.400]  word is with a Fox lineup five days a week with some heavy hitters the little
[03:03:47.400 --> 03:03:51.760]  bird told me about and wasn't you so big things coming can you speak to that and
[03:03:51.760 --> 03:03:56.480]  the way Fox is sliding towards the left right now well I know I will tell you
[03:03:56.480 --> 03:04:01.120]  there's a there's an opening for a real conservative true conservative voice
[03:04:01.120 --> 03:04:04.440]  that's always been me I just want to I want to fill that void that seems to be
[03:04:04.440 --> 03:04:09.480]  vacated Sean does very well but he's one guy you know and I know all of those
[03:04:09.480 --> 03:04:13.280]  people I know where their DNA is they weren't really conservative pro Trump
[03:04:13.280 --> 03:04:18.080]  Trump Sean has been the rest of them kind of in and out of that I just I want
[03:04:18.080 --> 03:04:22.520]  to be that other boys I want to be there look it's our country see that thing up
[03:04:22.520 --> 03:04:26.440]  top that's that's liberate that's freedom right there I want to be part of that all
[03:04:26.440 --> 03:04:30.760]  right good talking to you all right great interview
[03:04:30.760 --> 03:04:35.280]  all right man well any time you're in Austin come down or come up here I'll go again
[03:04:35.280 --> 03:04:54.160]  defending the Republic from enemies born and domestic it's Alex Jones you know
[03:04:54.160 --> 03:04:58.240]  the worst part about getting old I'm still strong at 45 is that I won't be
[03:04:58.240 --> 03:05:01.920]  there for my children someday that's why I need to make them strong now now I can
[03:05:01.920 --> 03:05:06.600]  be there for my children now I can make them strong now I can instruct them now
[03:05:06.600 --> 03:05:09.640]  I can teach them what I've learned but not once I'm gone you think of this
[03:05:09.640 --> 03:05:12.800]  digital age your words going forever but now they're even better getting rid of
[03:05:12.800 --> 03:05:17.200]  what you said they were before it's so much easier to burn video or text or
[03:05:17.200 --> 03:05:21.480]  languages now that we have high tech book burning isn't it but I have joined
[03:05:21.480 --> 03:05:26.240]  my will to the resistance I can't be destroyed now as long as I realize I've
[03:05:26.240 --> 03:05:29.560]  done right and the longer the people know the truth and you can't be destroyed
[03:05:29.560 --> 03:05:34.560]  either as long as you bind yourself to something and commit to it and go through
[03:05:34.560 --> 03:05:38.920]  the fire for it there is a magic that then takes place the transcend space and
[03:05:38.920 --> 03:05:42.760]  time when you commit be a word of mouth or to pray for us or to spread our
[03:05:42.760 --> 03:05:47.200]  articles and videos that overrides everything the enemy's doing so please
[03:05:47.200 --> 03:05:51.640]  now commit to support info wars however you can and realize your provision to
[03:05:51.640 --> 03:06:03.120]  info wars is your own provision
[03:06:03.120 --> 03:06:11.120]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Nick baggage you're
[03:06:11.120 --> 03:06:23.920]  listening to the Alex Jones show and I'm sitting in for Alex and the fourth
[03:06:23.920 --> 03:06:28.880]  hour we just watched that that interview start up the hour what a great
[03:06:28.880 --> 03:06:34.360]  interview in DC you know really talking about the media and media control
[03:06:34.360 --> 03:06:38.320]  that seems to be the subject of the day right when you really look at what's
[03:06:38.320 --> 03:06:43.840]  happened with the whole last two years of media coverage everything coming at
[03:06:43.840 --> 03:06:48.160]  Donald Trump and you know people don't know this but I'll say this on the air
[03:06:48.160 --> 03:06:53.880]  we just we just looked it up Donald Trump has had his best fundraising quarter
[03:06:53.880 --> 03:07:00.280]  ever 30 million raised for a little over 40 million on hand for the upcoming
[03:07:00.280 --> 03:07:04.160]  election in two years I think that's pretty impressive and the average
[03:07:04.160 --> 03:07:10.360]  donation this is really mind-blowing it's 34 bucks that means it's you and me
[03:07:10.360 --> 03:07:16.840]  small guys making contributions that are making the difference right now and I
[03:07:16.840 --> 03:07:21.000]  think that says a lot when you look at campaign contributions you know that's
[03:07:21.000 --> 03:07:25.040]  kind of one of the things that I've looked at over over history because my
[03:07:25.040 --> 03:07:27.640]  family's been involved you know a couple generations going into the third
[03:07:27.640 --> 03:07:34.440]  generation of politics and you track the the money in two ways one as you look
[03:07:34.440 --> 03:07:37.920]  for the number of donors because you really want to know is this somebody
[03:07:37.920 --> 03:07:43.360]  supported on the grassroots level or is this someone corporately supported where
[03:07:43.360 --> 03:07:47.600]  they have a very small nest of donors that are all the insiders the elites
[03:07:47.600 --> 03:07:52.480]  people with big money usually they're opposing the candidate with a broad base
[03:07:52.480 --> 03:07:57.320]  of donors who actually might be saying something that resonates with the average
[03:07:57.320 --> 03:08:02.440]  citizen it's something to pay attention to in the election cycle easy to look up
[03:08:02.440 --> 03:08:06.840]  find out who's running the corporate candidates who's running the populist
[03:08:06.840 --> 03:08:12.440]  candidates because populism after all is about you and me you know when I think
[03:08:12.440 --> 03:08:20.440]  about media control and what is media today the idea of just the way in which
[03:08:20.440 --> 03:08:25.880]  it's controlled you know I was down in Austin last week and then home in time
[03:08:25.880 --> 03:08:30.200]  for Easter with my family and my family's a mixed group you know we have
[03:08:30.200 --> 03:08:37.000]  Democrats libertarians Republicans and independence the whole mix and we're
[03:08:37.000 --> 03:08:43.880]  talking about what's going on in government obviously and it turns into a
[03:08:43.880 --> 03:08:47.800]  lively debate most of the time and you know this told me how controlled the
[03:08:47.800 --> 03:08:52.040]  newsfeed is because my family's regularly pretty informed but they're not
[03:08:52.040 --> 03:08:56.280]  looking at the contrarian view and I think the contrarian view the view opposite
[03:08:56.280 --> 03:09:00.480]  the one we hold is really important for all of us to know because if you're going
[03:09:00.480 --> 03:09:05.000]  to have a good debate you got to know your opposition you know the Pelosi clip
[03:09:05.000 --> 03:09:08.560]  that I've aired a number of times last week I aired it again showing you know
[03:09:08.560 --> 03:09:14.280]  the falseness of how they just literally lie and then let the media pick up the
[03:09:14.280 --> 03:09:18.520]  lie and then they quote the media as if it's factual you know this whole concept
[03:09:18.520 --> 03:09:26.040]  of synthetic facts synthetic news and then nonsense thrown back it's a shock
[03:09:26.040 --> 03:09:31.400]  oh no Pelosi never said that I'm gonna send them the clip because they got to
[03:09:31.400 --> 03:09:35.200]  see it to believe it and even then it's like what do you do with that you know
[03:09:35.200 --> 03:09:39.880]  when the political leadership is saying here's how you lie to the country that's
[03:09:39.880 --> 03:09:44.520]  the beginning of the problem and the media fails to report it efficiently
[03:09:44.520 --> 03:09:48.480]  because that's that's really telling you know when I when we talk I saw my son
[03:09:48.480 --> 03:09:52.520]  about this earlier today and you're the scope of when somebody makes those kind
[03:09:52.520 --> 03:09:58.040]  of statements and you think about the breadth of what it takes to get there
[03:09:58.040 --> 03:10:04.360]  to discuss the wrap-up smear as Pelosi called it how to really screw someone
[03:10:04.360 --> 03:10:10.080]  over so royally by leaking some lie to the press like what we just saw in this
[03:10:10.080 --> 03:10:15.560]  Russian nonsense for two years and then the Democrats then pick that lie up and
[03:10:15.560 --> 03:10:21.200]  quote the press as if it's a fact they call it merchandising the idea this is
[03:10:21.200 --> 03:10:26.880]  not government ladies and gentlemen this is the opposite of government this is
[03:10:26.880 --> 03:10:32.360]  manipulation at the highest level and this is why she's not doing the
[03:10:32.360 --> 03:10:38.480]  impeachment hearings why that's kind of no no is because they're seeing what the
[03:10:38.480 --> 03:10:44.640]  actual facts are that are coming forward now that this nonsense with Russian
[03:10:44.640 --> 03:10:49.840]  collusion is put to rest and you know the Ukrainians offering up evidence now
[03:10:49.840 --> 03:10:55.640]  on that shows Hillary was the one manipulating elections now just look
[03:10:55.640 --> 03:11:04.320]  what happened in Ukraine an actor right in a comedy show in Ukraine just won 70
[03:11:04.320 --> 03:11:08.160]  percent of the vote in Ukraine if you haven't been paying attention to this
[03:11:08.160 --> 03:11:16.080]  what's really wild about this this guy who won in Ukraine had a television show
[03:11:16.080 --> 03:11:20.880]  that was making fun of the government and its corruption in Ukraine and this
[03:11:20.880 --> 03:11:25.560]  guy was the hero unraveling the corruption and the public voted him into
[03:11:25.560 --> 03:11:33.360]  the actual to run the country to be the leader of that country think about this
[03:11:33.360 --> 03:11:42.280]  for a moment the public no matter where you live in the world is so fed up with
[03:11:42.280 --> 03:11:48.200]  the elites they'd rather take a chance on a comedian who at least they feel is
[03:11:48.200 --> 03:11:52.320]  speaking from his heart and might actually be able to put together a
[03:11:52.320 --> 03:11:56.720]  government that might govern for the people that live there servant of the
[03:11:56.720 --> 03:12:01.800]  people that's the name of the show right servant of the people what a concept
[03:12:01.800 --> 03:12:05.360]  I want to talk about that idea you know when I worked for the anchor school
[03:12:05.360 --> 03:12:08.600]  district years ago and I'm sure the policy still doesn't exist if you want to
[03:12:08.600 --> 03:12:13.040]  look it up but back in those days I had proposed when I was an employee that
[03:12:13.040 --> 03:12:17.880]  maybe the school district school board ought to have a policy in their policy
[03:12:17.880 --> 03:12:22.440]  book that says the obligation of all employees within the organization is
[03:12:22.440 --> 03:12:28.560]  firstly to the public seems pretty straightforward right no policy that says
[03:12:28.560 --> 03:12:34.320]  public employees first obligation is to the public now it was part of a whole
[03:12:34.320 --> 03:12:37.400]  accountability agenda I was trying to put forward at that time and you know
[03:12:37.400 --> 03:12:42.480]  what the school board president said to me then they said oh we can't have this
[03:12:42.480 --> 03:12:46.960]  policy the leadership team thought it was would be too controversial would create
[03:12:46.960 --> 03:12:53.760]  too many conflicts what too many conflicts because it would divide the
[03:12:53.760 --> 03:13:00.960]  loyalty of public servants between the public and their bosses whoa wait a
[03:13:00.960 --> 03:13:06.200]  minute ladies and gentlemen this is when the bureaucracy has left us this is
[03:13:06.200 --> 03:13:10.920]  when the government has left us when it's more important for an employee our
[03:13:10.920 --> 03:13:16.080]  employees to be loyal to their chain of command versus being loyal to the public
[03:13:16.080 --> 03:13:19.800]  they serve now when I was there we got whistleblower laws passed at the
[03:13:19.800 --> 03:13:23.400]  municipal level at the state level to protect public employees so you could go
[03:13:23.400 --> 03:13:27.880]  forward on matters of public interest to public bodies and make your statements
[03:13:27.880 --> 03:13:32.320]  and be absolutely protected under the law and have some recourse we need
[03:13:32.320 --> 03:13:36.240]  whistleblowers we need institutional whistleblowers not just against
[03:13:36.240 --> 03:13:39.240]  government because that's a little easier you know here we have an
[03:13:39.240 --> 03:13:44.400]  ombudsman sort of the people's person that has subpoena authority that can go
[03:13:44.400 --> 03:13:47.960]  into our local government school district was exempt at one point we got that
[03:13:47.960 --> 03:13:52.320]  extended so that they can reach in and see what's going on within government
[03:13:52.320 --> 03:13:58.920]  for you ombudsman what an interesting concept we need ombudsman's for the
[03:13:58.920 --> 03:14:02.960]  public this way you've got subpoena power you've got confidentiality you got
[03:14:02.960 --> 03:14:08.040]  someone with the power to meet government on of equal footing and dive into
[03:14:08.040 --> 03:14:12.080]  the record on an equal footing so you don't see what happens to whistleblowers
[03:14:12.080 --> 03:14:16.640]  around the world they get condemned they get beaten up they got holed up in
[03:14:16.640 --> 03:14:22.480]  embassies they get every manner of injustice because they brought us some measure of
[03:14:22.480 --> 03:14:28.760]  truth that might lead to some measure of justice that's what we need from the
[03:14:28.760 --> 03:14:35.000]  media is the truth and we don't get it we get marginalized news you know CNN with
[03:14:35.000 --> 03:14:40.640]  lower ratings than hallmark channel more people are interested in cartoons than
[03:14:40.640 --> 03:14:47.400]  CNN and why is that people hunger for accurate reporting for real information
[03:14:47.400 --> 03:14:51.720]  that might be useful that's why the alternative media is exploding but at
[03:14:51.720 --> 03:14:56.840]  the same time more and more people are gravitating to the narrowest bandwidth
[03:14:56.840 --> 03:15:01.920]  where we're only looking at the messaging that resonates with us we need to
[03:15:01.920 --> 03:15:06.440]  look at the opposition understand their arguments and then take them apart with
[03:15:06.440 --> 03:15:10.840]  facts not with emotion not with charge with the real information and that's
[03:15:10.840 --> 03:15:15.360]  what we're about to see over the next two years we saw the circus of the
[03:15:15.360 --> 03:15:22.160]  Democrats who now are in for the revelation because the other shoe is
[03:15:22.160 --> 03:15:28.160]  about to drop you know when you think about the media being held in such low
[03:15:28.160 --> 03:15:33.640]  esteem by the public what does that tell you where is the trust of the nation
[03:15:33.640 --> 03:15:39.720]  media needs to be accurate and informing and not one-sided manipulations

[03:20:09.000 --> 03:20:17.720]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones and now your
[03:20:17.720 --> 03:20:27.280]  host nick baggage and welcome back to the info wars this is a Friday afternoon
[03:20:27.280 --> 03:20:33.960]  and April 26 2019 you know that we've been talking a little bit about the
[03:20:33.960 --> 03:20:38.400]  media kind of what's been happening last couple days I mean Hannity last night
[03:20:38.400 --> 03:20:43.120]  we saw that last hour with with alex talking about what all went on there
[03:20:43.120 --> 03:20:49.560]  this is the beginning you know the media generally is about the most untrusted
[03:20:49.560 --> 03:20:54.320]  source of information on the planet these days the only other group that's
[03:20:54.320 --> 03:20:58.840]  probably got a lower rating with the public as the Congress itself now when
[03:20:58.840 --> 03:21:03.040]  we think about this you know when you think about low ratings low trust levels
[03:21:03.040 --> 03:21:07.800]  for the media and the media is running around trying to defend themselves and
[03:21:07.800 --> 03:21:12.600]  beat up everybody that's attacking them this is the wrong approach actually it
[03:21:12.600 --> 03:21:17.040]  tells you something you know just just stay with the news you don't need to be
[03:21:17.040 --> 03:21:22.280]  defending yourself defend the facts if you have any and that's been the problem
[03:21:22.280 --> 03:21:26.080]  with the mainstream they're not doing the level of investigative reporting that
[03:21:26.080 --> 03:21:30.840]  the alternatives have and do and historically have done and yeah we always
[03:21:30.840 --> 03:21:36.920]  press the edge you know in order to bring forward the best of what's going
[03:21:36.920 --> 03:21:41.440]  on in the news you know what what is really amazing after all these years
[03:21:41.440 --> 03:21:46.520]  quarter of a century the reporting that that myself alex and others have been
[03:21:46.520 --> 03:21:51.800]  making 99% of the time is exactly as predicted and it's not based on some
[03:21:51.800 --> 03:21:57.160]  weird metaphysical esoteric formulation it's just based on reviewing the facts
[03:21:57.160 --> 03:22:01.560]  reviewing the information and seeing quite clearly what those facts show us
[03:22:01.560 --> 03:22:06.640]  and and that's the difference you know when you think about media right now is
[03:22:06.640 --> 03:22:11.440]  so worried and big tech and this is where Trump really has to nail big tech
[03:22:11.440 --> 03:22:16.480]  it's a source of so much news and you think about it breaking up these
[03:22:16.480 --> 03:22:20.520]  monopolies and making sure everyone has equal access that they're not able to
[03:22:20.520 --> 03:22:26.520]  manipulate the ratings at the data flows so people have truly equal access to
[03:22:26.520 --> 03:22:32.080]  information requires that the filters of the big tech companies be broken down
[03:22:32.080 --> 03:22:36.880]  because we know we've seen it manipulating the numbers manipulating the
[03:22:36.880 --> 03:22:40.640]  way search engines work it's happened to me now right mine are being affected as
[03:22:40.640 --> 03:22:47.800]  well when you think about antitrust how many times has the Democrats brought up
[03:22:47.800 --> 03:22:51.880]  antitrust it's their biggest issue historically go back 50 years and
[03:22:51.880 --> 03:22:57.320]  they're not saying a word about the big tech antitrust because right now it
[03:22:57.320 --> 03:23:01.800]  serves them but if it didn't serve them would they be screaming the loudest a
[03:23:01.800 --> 03:23:06.960]  course they would and this is the problem about polarized politics these are
[03:23:06.960 --> 03:23:10.600]  fundamental whether you're on the right or the left freedom of the press freedom
[03:23:10.600 --> 03:23:14.640]  of speech freedom of discourse is really what it's about whether it's
[03:23:14.640 --> 03:23:20.240]  religion politics the art science whatever that is we should be free to
[03:23:20.240 --> 03:23:24.800]  have that discourse in the public square of the 21st century which is here
[03:23:24.800 --> 03:23:29.600]  through the internet through radio through the wireless systems of
[03:23:29.600 --> 03:23:34.920]  communication and nothing should restrict those and any restriction should
[03:23:34.920 --> 03:23:38.600]  be dealt with criminally as an obstruction of our civil liberties and
[03:23:38.600 --> 03:23:42.920]  civil rights if you're going to be in business and you're going to run the
[03:23:42.920 --> 03:23:47.480]  media for the world then you need to be accountable to the public that you also
[03:23:47.480 --> 03:23:52.320]  serve you know think about it before the break we're talking about whistleblowing
[03:23:52.320 --> 03:23:57.000]  we're talking about media the collusion and control really of government and
[03:23:57.000 --> 03:24:02.560]  media whistleblowers are a fundamental part of the media that's the alliance
[03:24:02.560 --> 03:24:06.720]  that should be taking place not an alliance of big government big
[03:24:06.720 --> 03:24:11.480]  corporations and big media to manipulate what we think what we see and what we
[03:24:11.480 --> 03:24:16.840]  believe and then throwing technological overlays that even add more power to
[03:24:16.840 --> 03:24:22.600]  that agenda the opposite needs to happen now the dismantling of big tech the
[03:24:22.600 --> 03:24:27.520]  flattening of the town square where we all have equal access in civil and
[03:24:27.520 --> 03:24:33.640]  criminal criminal penalties for the officers and big boards of those
[03:24:33.640 --> 03:24:37.840]  corporations make them criminally liable like what we just saw happen in the
[03:24:37.840 --> 03:24:41.680]  farm industry you know one of the states I believe was New York just indicted a
[03:24:41.680 --> 03:24:45.800]  bunch of people that are officers people who run companies running criminal
[03:24:45.800 --> 03:24:50.080]  enterprises conspiracies to traffic and drugs because they're the biggest
[03:24:50.080 --> 03:24:56.640]  opiate manufacturer and propagandist on the planet the pharma industry the death
[03:24:56.640 --> 03:25:01.680]  industry you know when you look at what's happened to big corporations you
[03:25:01.680 --> 03:25:05.800]  look at what has happened to the whole configuration of government and media
[03:25:05.800 --> 03:25:11.320]  working against the public yeah that's why the media is in the toilet where they
[03:25:11.320 --> 03:25:16.920]  belong that's why the Congress is in the lowest esteem ever because that's the
[03:25:16.920 --> 03:25:22.040]  way they belong people do not trust the government right now which is why the
[03:25:22.040 --> 03:25:28.240]  media needs to do their job do the job of info wars and others instead of
[03:25:28.240 --> 03:25:32.640]  marginalizing these networks recognize what they've done to bring in the truth
[03:25:32.640 --> 03:25:40.120]  and we need to protect the independent voices even when we disagree even when
[03:25:40.120 --> 03:25:45.880]  we disagree because the next day is your day and we're starting to see many in
[03:25:45.880 --> 03:25:50.800]  the left starting to recognize that the suppression of dialogue cuts both ways
[03:25:50.800 --> 03:25:56.640]  you cannot begin down this slippery slope we need to unknot the knot we need
[03:25:56.640 --> 03:25:59.920]  the president to recognize that these fundamental freedoms of the First
[03:25:59.920 --> 03:26:06.520]  Amendment or what's at stake and that means our entire way of life is on the
[03:26:06.520 --> 03:26:10.840]  blocks this next cycle this is going to be the most important election of the
[03:26:10.840 --> 03:26:15.840]  century of the last hundred years in my opinion because we're either going back
[03:26:15.840 --> 03:26:19.840]  words or we're going forwards the Democrats of the party of the backwards
[03:26:19.840 --> 03:26:24.200]  nature of man they want to talk about reparations they want to talk about
[03:26:24.200 --> 03:26:29.480]  socialism they want to talk about a bunch of crazy things reparations give me a
[03:26:29.480 --> 03:26:33.360]  break you know if you're gonna have reparations for anybody take a look at
[03:26:33.360 --> 03:26:38.120]  Native Americans right we're still breathing from the in this generation of
[03:26:38.120 --> 03:26:43.800]  the screwing they got from the nation but hey they're not the ones asking you
[03:26:43.800 --> 03:26:49.260]  know we see this reparations dialogue that is a divisive dialogue I could say
[03:26:49.260 --> 03:26:53.640]  the same thing the Romans invaded Croatia where my ancestors were from I
[03:26:53.640 --> 03:26:58.440]  want the Italians to pay me reparations how crazy is that or the Turks the
[03:26:58.440 --> 03:27:01.880]  Ottoman Empire they came into southern Europe screwed up my whole family back
[03:27:01.880 --> 03:27:06.520]  500 years ago 600 years ago 800 years ago I should be right have reparations
[03:27:06.520 --> 03:27:12.160]  for that nonsense nonsense we are living in the present and we are building a
[03:27:12.160 --> 03:27:17.320]  future we are not going backwards because our generations past made
[03:27:17.320 --> 03:27:22.000]  mistakes we all know what those mistakes were that's why in this form of
[03:27:22.000 --> 03:27:25.960]  government we have something that can evolve with the value systems of the
[03:27:25.960 --> 03:27:30.120]  American public while maintaining maintaining those basic things that
[03:27:30.120 --> 03:27:34.360]  allow us to have a dialogue so we have changed the country has changed
[03:27:34.360 --> 03:27:40.000]  slavery has gone it happened over 150 years ago no one's alive anymore that's
[03:27:40.000 --> 03:27:44.960]  a victim we need to quit being victims of this country start recognizing that
[03:27:44.960 --> 03:27:52.800]  what we have is is an absolute flower in the world in so many ways the base
[03:27:52.800 --> 03:27:58.080]  value systems held by the left and the right need to be remembered and put in
[03:27:58.080 --> 03:28:02.280]  the forefront of what we're doing in this election cycle freedom of the press
[03:28:02.280 --> 03:28:09.760]  freedom from censorship freedom from being ratcheted down by big tech that's
[03:28:09.760 --> 03:28:15.480]  what this next election cycle is going to be about freedom from the press not
[03:28:15.480 --> 03:28:19.800]  freedom of the press is what my father used to say you should also say the
[03:28:19.800 --> 03:28:24.480]  only bad press is an obituary and maybe in his day I would agree but what has
[03:28:24.480 --> 03:28:30.000]  happened with the media today is a sin against this republic and needs to be
[03:28:30.000 --> 03:28:34.760]  changed this administration needs to step up the regulation and an open
[03:28:34.760 --> 03:28:39.360]  dialogue and break the antitrust and open the speech of this country again so we
[03:28:39.360 --> 03:28:44.080]  can have that dialogue that's what info wars is all about that is what info

[03:33:29.760 --> 03:33:36.360]  dr. nick baggage sending in for alex in this last hour yeah we're man what a
[03:33:36.360 --> 03:33:40.320]  couple of weeks last week I was in Austin for the week working with the
[03:33:40.320 --> 03:33:44.360]  team down there and we produced a bunch of segments for the with the different
[03:33:44.360 --> 03:33:48.840]  hosts and then some independent segments to go up over the next few weeks you
[03:33:48.840 --> 03:33:53.720]  know the the whole compression of all of this now you know as things sort of
[03:33:53.720 --> 03:34:00.920]  unravel after the Mueller report last week and what's coming from that additional
[03:34:00.920 --> 03:34:06.360]  indictments are sure to come we're waiting on that the the draining of the
[03:34:06.360 --> 03:34:11.720]  swamp stage two looks like it's about to start a little rash of our
[03:34:11.720 --> 03:34:16.800]  resignations as people run out the gate let's see what happens in a couple weeks
[03:34:16.800 --> 03:34:19.960]  I think it's gonna be a really important time let's see what the Trump
[03:34:19.960 --> 03:34:26.240]  administration does I think that it's the standard Trump fair you know you get
[03:34:26.240 --> 03:34:30.720]  everyone looking over here while you're getting ready to launch over there and I
[03:34:30.720 --> 03:34:35.360]  think that's what we're about to see and I'm looking forward to it I want to
[03:34:35.360 --> 03:34:39.320]  talk a little bit too about what's going on in the economy right now sort of how
[03:34:39.320 --> 03:34:43.760]  how does all this shake out you know we're again seeing the numbers came out
[03:34:43.760 --> 03:34:51.480]  today 3.2% growth in the first quarter the biggest in years when you think about
[03:34:51.480 --> 03:34:56.520]  unemployment the lowest in 50 years and then the the reason they didn't predict
[03:34:56.520 --> 03:35:01.520]  that the economy would increase at this level again 3.2% the first quarter is
[03:35:01.520 --> 03:35:05.840]  because the unemployment is so low and it's been so low what they're not
[03:35:05.840 --> 03:35:10.000]  looking at my son pointed this out to me earlier today said look they're not
[03:35:10.000 --> 03:35:14.880]  looking at how many people are coming off of the welfare roles take a look at
[03:35:14.880 --> 03:35:20.000]  those numbers because of welfare reform over the last decade and it's slowly
[03:35:20.000 --> 03:35:24.080]  worked its way and there has been some things there but now in this employment
[03:35:24.080 --> 03:35:28.680]  environment there's great opportunities people are coming off of public
[03:35:28.680 --> 03:35:34.680]  assistance off of the welfare roles and going back to work this is great for our
[03:35:34.680 --> 03:35:38.280]  economy on several different levels plus just think about it I mean having the
[03:35:38.280 --> 03:35:42.240]  dignity of a job getting up every day having a place to go being paid a decent
[03:35:42.240 --> 03:35:46.560]  wage and being able to support yourself you know that's fundamental to what we
[03:35:46.560 --> 03:35:50.640]  are you know as humans working in the world so that's a great thing the other
[03:35:50.640 --> 03:35:53.920]  thing we're seeing for two reasons one of them is not so good one of them is
[03:35:53.920 --> 03:35:58.800]  great and you're seeing people coming off of retirement and out of retirement
[03:35:58.800 --> 03:36:01.720]  back into the workforce now part of those are coming in because they can't
[03:36:01.720 --> 03:36:06.200]  they can't live on what they're what they're making and I understand that
[03:36:06.200 --> 03:36:10.720]  that's a hardship it's one of the reasons we got to preserve the safety nets that
[03:36:10.720 --> 03:36:14.760]  we do have legitimately operating in the country and quit looting them like
[03:36:14.760 --> 03:36:18.160]  Social Security which ought to help I mean that was a point of the matter in
[03:36:18.160 --> 03:36:23.400]  the beginning what we've done is bastardize it as something else you know
[03:36:23.400 --> 03:36:27.280]  and and that I think we need to get back to the basics of what are getting
[03:36:27.280 --> 03:36:30.880]  people in the workforce now the opportunity of bringing in senior
[03:36:30.880 --> 03:36:35.160]  employees retirees back into the workforce to draw in a couple of ways
[03:36:35.160 --> 03:36:38.920]  one their ability to focus and pay attention something the newest generation
[03:36:38.920 --> 03:36:44.080]  is losing because of the way things are going the other reason is retirement
[03:36:44.080 --> 03:36:48.440]  savings are being exhausted by many people raising their adult children
[03:36:48.440 --> 03:36:52.440]  which we've all read about and heard about now it's like 23 is sort of the
[03:36:52.440 --> 03:36:57.080]  average age where parents break it off and some parents are paying their kids
[03:36:57.080 --> 03:37:03.760]  bills up into their 30s and their 40s rent groceries student loans whatever you
[03:37:03.760 --> 03:37:07.840]  know we haven't created a self-sufficient independent generation in so many
[03:37:07.840 --> 03:37:11.480]  ways in the current generation so they're bringing in retirees with
[03:37:11.480 --> 03:37:16.000]  experience knowledge and maybe a way to mentor the next generation into being
[03:37:16.000 --> 03:37:20.600]  productive employees and and I'm not saying that about all young people
[03:37:20.600 --> 03:37:25.240]  because I can tell you what I I met some of us in the last few weeks
[03:37:25.240 --> 03:37:30.840]  particularly some really really brilliant young men and women in the
[03:37:30.840 --> 03:37:35.960]  info wars group I mean a lot of the technicians the writers people working on
[03:37:35.960 --> 03:37:40.480]  the background making us look good up here these are all young people who
[03:37:40.480 --> 03:37:45.320]  understand the technologies and what it can do but they're also driven by
[03:37:45.320 --> 03:37:50.440]  ideology and and beliefs and and ideas that make this one of the most powerful
[03:37:50.440 --> 03:37:55.040]  networks on the planet today miss with the help of those within the

[03:38:38.240 --> 03:38:43.400]  media is even criticizing this and you know that they exist on advertisers
[03:38:43.400 --> 03:38:48.840]  which tell them what to say here you are the advertisers you know you're the
[03:38:48.840 --> 03:38:55.400]  consumers that get the news one bottle at a time one book at a time you support
[03:38:55.400 --> 03:38:59.080]  this network that's the best grant source in the world when the public
[03:38:59.080 --> 03:39:04.400]  supports the network it really reflects the message that you're looking for
[03:39:04.400 --> 03:39:08.760]  which is the version of the truth that the evidence supports and recognizing
[03:39:08.760 --> 03:39:12.560]  that when we make mistakes and it happens occasionally we retract we make the
[03:39:12.560 --> 03:39:17.480]  amends that's something the mainstream never does and you can rely on the
[03:39:17.480 --> 03:39:21.160]  information you can rely on the products you can rely on this network to bring
[03:39:21.160 --> 03:39:25.480]  you the best information on the planet you know when you when you look at
[03:39:25.480 --> 03:39:29.640]  everybody that contributes you know you've got listeners sending us that all
[03:39:29.640 --> 03:39:34.280]  the time you've got a variety of hosts bringing information all the time all
[03:39:34.280 --> 03:39:38.200]  with different styles different approaches and with that we bring the
[03:39:38.200 --> 03:39:42.280]  information we think the public needs to hear you know thinking about the
[03:39:42.280 --> 03:39:46.560]  economy again and what's happening you know I think we still have growth at the
[03:39:46.560 --> 03:39:53.240]  Fed can stay in their current position you know we're not seeing the inflation
[03:39:53.240 --> 03:39:58.000]  the hyperinflation nothing things are really good growth is happening there's
[03:39:58.000 --> 03:40:02.360]  a lot of things going on in the economy now we're starting to see wages start to
[03:40:02.360 --> 03:40:07.280]  ratchet up after decades of stagnation this is a good thing this is coming from
[03:40:07.280 --> 03:40:11.720]  the tax reform act that freed up more money domestically you're seeing more
[03:40:11.720 --> 03:40:16.480]  automation more investments in factories more investors in plants because
[03:40:16.480 --> 03:40:21.640]  automation gives us a competitive advantage same time you know as all of
[03:40:21.640 --> 03:40:25.240]  that's happening AI is developing which has a two-edged sort of all
[03:40:25.240 --> 03:40:29.360]  technology is going to be used for us or against us but the fact is these
[03:40:29.360 --> 03:40:35.120]  technologies are what makes government strong command and control of
[03:40:35.120 --> 03:40:40.320]  technologies is what makes government strong knowledge about technologies is
[03:40:40.320 --> 03:40:45.200]  all of our responsibilities within democratic republics because this is
[03:40:45.200 --> 03:40:50.800]  what drives our governments and our economies what we see happening globally
[03:40:50.800 --> 03:40:57.440]  is the shift of so much of productive capacity capital capital equipment things
[03:40:57.440 --> 03:41:01.960]  that make things has been moved to China and to the third world that's real
[03:41:01.960 --> 03:41:05.800]  wealth been moved to the third world and being combined with entrepreneurship and
[03:41:05.800 --> 03:41:10.480]  labor again an advantage of the third world with commodities coming out of
[03:41:10.480 --> 03:41:14.120]  the first world the developed world and the third world to feed that chain
[03:41:14.120 --> 03:41:19.760]  because everything's being pushed out of the west east and those in the east that
[03:41:19.760 --> 03:41:26.760]  have power the Russian the Chinese are recognizing the the whole silken road the
[03:41:26.760 --> 03:41:30.800]  whole initiatives of China the cooperation of China and Russia is about
[03:41:30.800 --> 03:41:37.160]  building a balance of hemispheres okay because that's what's always taken place
[03:41:37.160 --> 03:41:42.980]  and really behind that is a balance of economic interest and globalists who
[03:41:42.980 --> 03:41:47.080]  like to know there's always a competing power that can collect you know one of
[03:41:47.080 --> 03:41:50.520]  the early books on this was a book called none day or call it conspiracy
[03:41:50.520 --> 03:41:54.240]  written during the Carter administration I would recommend young viewers
[03:41:54.240 --> 03:41:59.600]  especially and listeners go back and look up the book none day or call it
[03:41:59.600 --> 03:42:04.960]  conspiracy because it really lays out a pattern and a framework of globalists
[03:42:04.960 --> 03:42:10.600]  that still exists today and this is going back I mean decades back in time
[03:42:10.600 --> 03:42:17.680]  it's been updated I'm looking at it right now Larry Abram was on author but
[03:42:17.680 --> 03:42:21.680]  Gary Allen was a guy who got famous for this piece of work and it is it's well
[03:42:21.680 --> 03:42:26.800]  worth reading again I encourage people to get that look at it and then lay it up
[03:42:26.800 --> 03:42:31.600]  against the current backdrop of what's going on and also read 1984 you know the
[03:42:31.600 --> 03:42:36.520]  fiction and see the fact in what's playing out in our world today this
[03:42:36.520 --> 03:42:42.040]  network is one of the few voices remaining that needs to be supported

[03:46:53.520 --> 03:47:17.720]  you're listening to the alex jones show the alex jones show because there is a
[03:47:17.720 --> 03:47:31.040]  war on for your mind with nick baggage welcome back to this last segment of
[03:47:31.040 --> 03:47:37.520]  Friday April 26 2019 this is dr. nick baggage sitting in for alex and you know
[03:47:37.520 --> 03:47:41.200]  we've been talking about a couple things you can kind of a little bit about the
[03:47:41.200 --> 03:47:47.800]  media and sort of how that's gone and how it's really gone bad is what we got
[03:47:47.800 --> 03:47:53.920]  to say but really the combination of it becoming the propaganda tool for
[03:47:53.920 --> 03:47:57.600]  government in fact there was even appropriations made within the
[03:47:57.600 --> 03:48:02.280]  government's budget for propaganda you know what is that that's about messaging
[03:48:02.280 --> 03:48:06.600]  that's about pushing the public into certain opinions I don't think this is
[03:48:06.600 --> 03:48:10.240]  the role of government quite frankly I think this is not the role of the
[03:48:10.240 --> 03:48:14.800]  role of government is to reflect our views and world views within our
[03:48:14.800 --> 03:48:18.800]  government not the other way around not to establish ideas and then shove them
[03:48:18.800 --> 03:48:23.080]  down the public's throat this is not the way our government was designed not the
[03:48:23.080 --> 03:48:26.960]  way it was originally intended to operate at all it was it was really the
[03:48:26.960 --> 03:48:33.240]  opposite you know in the last couple of weeks I've been sort of rereading pain
[03:48:33.240 --> 03:48:36.880]  I've been reading the Federalist Papers rereading some of those basic
[03:48:36.880 --> 03:48:40.680]  documents that brought about the Republic and you know what's really
[03:48:40.680 --> 03:48:46.960]  striking it's exactly the same parallels you know it's like the
[03:48:46.960 --> 03:48:50.920]  nobility is now replaced by corporate entities but the families behind these
[03:48:50.920 --> 03:48:56.560]  tends to be the same you know how religion is used to manipulate people in
[03:48:56.560 --> 03:49:00.440]  one way or another not just in the United States but around the world
[03:49:00.440 --> 03:49:05.800]  various religious organizations are used to sort of suppress the population in
[03:49:05.800 --> 03:49:11.160]  certain ways well the crown so to speak the globalist loot the population in
[03:49:11.160 --> 03:49:16.960]  another way and when you look at sort of how all this plays off of us this is
[03:49:16.960 --> 03:49:22.320]  robbing us of our human dignity and what we really are is divinely created human
[03:49:22.320 --> 03:49:27.640]  beings and I've said this often in my broadcast lately you know reminding
[03:49:27.640 --> 03:49:33.080]  ourselves of what we are as we jump into the game of life you know this is a
[03:49:33.080 --> 03:49:39.360]  short very short stop on the planet that we get to do here and engage in this
[03:49:39.360 --> 03:49:44.000]  reality here as creatures created the image and likeness of God and we should
[03:49:44.000 --> 03:49:48.080]  begin reflecting that much differently in our discourse and much differently in
[03:49:48.080 --> 03:49:53.200]  the way we present the way we attack and the way we deliver the changes that
[03:49:53.200 --> 03:49:56.320]  each of us are affecting in our communities you know every single
[03:49:56.320 --> 03:50:02.720]  listener every single person viewing these broadcasts is able to jump into
[03:50:02.720 --> 03:50:08.840]  this fight and not in a combative this is sort of way but with information pass
[03:50:08.840 --> 03:50:15.200]  information on duplicate what you see connect people up to good data and let
[03:50:15.200 --> 03:50:18.680]  them make up their own minds hopefully they'll at least look at it and you
[03:50:18.680 --> 03:50:23.000]  don't have to push quite so hard and I think that's again we get it really
[03:50:23.000 --> 03:50:29.880]  excited and I do it too and and then we jump into this thing and and and that's
[03:50:29.880 --> 03:50:35.040]  critical of all this we got to keep that energy up and and what I know is it's
[03:50:35.040 --> 03:50:39.480]  easy to get dissuaded to get disillusioned by what you see in the
[03:50:39.480 --> 03:50:44.560]  world but what I know from my own experience is that as the temperature
[03:50:44.560 --> 03:50:49.480]  rises and you see greater and greater conflict the other is also present the
[03:50:49.480 --> 03:50:53.880]  opportunity for real solutions and those will come not from the top down but
[03:50:53.880 --> 03:50:57.400]  from the bottom up and that's what we're beginning to see more and more of
[03:50:57.400 --> 03:51:01.720]  people activating within our communities and doing something and saying
[03:51:01.720 --> 03:51:05.800]  something instead of just standing around you know that that slogan that drives
[03:51:05.800 --> 03:51:09.960]  me nuts in airports you know see something say something which is
[03:51:09.960 --> 03:51:13.040]  creating that sort of the thing that used to happen in Russia where it was
[03:51:13.040 --> 03:51:19.040]  spying on everybody but let's turn that around and and say about the public
[03:51:19.040 --> 03:51:25.280]  let's learn something and form someone how about that learn something new and
[03:51:25.280 --> 03:51:30.760]  form someone else make that are saying instead of this let's spy on our
[03:51:30.760 --> 03:51:34.920]  neighbors and pass it on to the government you know how about let's see
[03:51:34.920 --> 03:51:38.000]  what the world is doing let's see what our government is doing and pass that
[03:51:38.000 --> 03:51:42.240]  on to our neighbors a much better formula and one that can make a difference in
[03:51:42.240 --> 03:51:45.960]  the world and we've seen it every time that anything has changed on the planet
[03:51:45.960 --> 03:51:49.840]  earth you know when you think of revolutions as such in terms of
[03:51:49.840 --> 03:51:55.040]  thinking whether it's an art science business politics wherever human beings
[03:51:55.040 --> 03:52:00.080]  interact where there's real change it usually started with one or two people
[03:52:00.080 --> 03:52:04.840]  seeing a little bit differently and then articulating that and that's what the
[03:52:04.840 --> 03:52:10.880]  alternative media has been about and is about and what the idea of conturing in
[03:52:10.880 --> 03:52:16.360]  views has always been about is to elevate the debate to a point where we
[03:52:16.360 --> 03:52:22.800]  formulate solutions that can work in the current frame not that worked so much in
[03:52:22.800 --> 03:52:27.200]  the past or what we think might work in the future but address those basic
[03:52:27.200 --> 03:52:31.680]  things in the present and address them on the platform of ideals and values that
[03:52:31.680 --> 03:52:36.720]  should not go away that are embedded in our divinity and our humanity and what
[03:52:36.720 --> 03:52:42.600]  we are created to be and do on the planet when I think about what's happening in
[03:52:42.600 --> 03:52:48.000]  the shift of economies you know there's another report in the last day on gold
[03:52:48.000 --> 03:52:54.360]  acquisitions in Russia do you know that the Russians have dropped their US
[03:52:54.360 --> 03:53:01.040]  Treasury reserves by Amos Taft last year and replaced it almost equally with an
[03:53:01.040 --> 03:53:06.960]  amount of gold to offset that increasing their gold reserves substantially in the
[03:53:06.960 --> 03:53:12.800]  last month and substantially last year as they continue to deplete American
[03:53:12.800 --> 03:53:19.320]  paper there's a ad up if you see it or the article up and it's 600,000 ounces
[03:53:19.320 --> 03:53:24.080]  is what the Russians filled their vaults with you know and and what they're
[03:53:24.080 --> 03:53:27.720]  doing is they're getting away from the dollar because as you may not know and
[03:53:27.720 --> 03:53:34.520]  you may know the Eastern and Pacific Bank you know they got a whole new bank to
[03:53:34.520 --> 03:53:40.640]  compete with the International Monetary Fund and other Western controlled
[03:53:40.640 --> 03:53:44.480]  banking systems and they're replacing with something different to build their
[03:53:44.480 --> 03:53:48.400]  infrastructure to finance their debt and to create a different kind of economy
[03:53:48.400 --> 03:53:52.840]  that's not dollar-based this is a big thing happening right now what's going
[03:53:52.840 --> 03:53:57.040]  on in Saudi Arabia why we're still cooperating so highly with them is
[03:53:57.040 --> 03:54:00.520]  because they're sucking up a lot of those dollars somebody has to do it
[03:54:00.520 --> 03:54:05.160]  because the Chinese are dumping their dollars the Russians are dumping their
[03:54:05.160 --> 03:54:09.760]  dollars the brick is consolidating their wealth and their commodities based
[03:54:09.760 --> 03:54:18.480]  wealth real wealth gold silver copper zinc molybdenum iron ore on and on and
[03:54:18.480 --> 03:54:24.520]  on this is what's happening the productive wealth of the world is being
[03:54:24.520 --> 03:54:29.480]  shifted those four factors the things that run between those four factors of
[03:54:29.480 --> 03:54:34.960]  production is currency is money is fiat what those four things that represent
[03:54:34.960 --> 03:54:40.480]  real value what you spend your money on is entrepreneurship labor natural
[03:54:40.480 --> 03:54:44.680]  resources and physical plant things to build things the four economic factors
[03:54:44.680 --> 03:54:49.160]  of production the things that build real wealth the wealth of a nation is
[03:54:49.160 --> 03:54:54.600]  embedded in these factors we are debasing the productive factor the
[03:54:54.600 --> 03:54:59.240]  biggest is the factories the thing that kept us ahead of the game since the
[03:54:59.240 --> 03:55:05.480]  American Revolution think about it we began to operate cotton mills and
[03:55:05.480 --> 03:55:11.800]  factories that began to compete with the Europeans they then slapped us with
[03:55:11.800 --> 03:55:17.200]  with tariffs and things that restricted trade and stamp acts that's where the war
[03:55:17.200 --> 03:55:23.560]  began it was over unfair taxation and then what was warned about during the
[03:55:23.560 --> 03:55:27.960]  beginning of the revolution is they will use these wars to whip up the public
[03:55:27.960 --> 03:55:31.920]  and increase taxes to pay for the wars and then the taxes will never go away
[03:55:31.920 --> 03:55:37.880]  that's what that's what Payne was saying 250 years ago and it's still
[03:55:37.880 --> 03:55:42.440]  happening today I've talked about it in previous segments you know what's ripping
[03:55:42.440 --> 03:55:48.400]  the whole lot of the dollar is the shift of the way money is mapped the way
[03:55:48.400 --> 03:55:52.600]  contracts are being drawn internationally the dollar is slipping as a
[03:55:52.600 --> 03:55:59.520]  reserve currency increasingly so with China and Russia and others and as that
[03:55:59.520 --> 03:56:04.200]  happens and as they consolidate real wealth productive resources in these
[03:56:04.200 --> 03:56:09.240]  countries the final blow will happen it's going to be this administration and
[03:56:09.240 --> 03:56:14.080]  the next one that first save the foundations of the nation that allow us
[03:56:14.080 --> 03:56:19.480]  to be the leader the light in the world and then secondly to reevaluate our
[03:56:19.480 --> 03:56:24.320]  global position in the world let's not go backwards we are taking the right
[03:56:24.320 --> 03:56:29.480]  steps for just we have a bully in the White House and we needed one we needed
[03:56:29.480 --> 03:56:34.480]  one for a change we needed someone that would push back for you and for me and
[03:56:34.480 --> 03:56:41.320]  quit bending over running backwards leading from behind what a weird concept
[03:56:41.320 --> 03:56:46.680]  the Obama concept let's get behind lead from the back of the parade what are you
[03:56:46.680 --> 03:56:51.520]  kidding me let's reclaim let's make America great again by making it
[03:56:51.520 --> 03:56:57.000]  recognized as a true voice for freedom not the dictator that comes into your
[03:56:57.000 --> 03:57:01.800]  country and does regime change as a way to interfere with your elections but
[03:57:01.800 --> 03:57:05.720]  comes back to our base and recognizes that the engagement of foreign wars
[03:57:05.720 --> 03:57:10.600]  generally don't work in our favor particularly when most of those conflicts
[03:57:10.600 --> 03:57:15.280]  fuel the military industrial industrial complex that has been working against the
[03:57:15.280 --> 03:57:19.760]  American public support the info wars support this network and do it right
[03:57:19.760 --> 03:57:25.800]  now this is dr. Nick baggage you've been listening to info war wars calm and I'm

[03:58:44.320 --> 03:58:48.640]  I want to say brain force is great I want to say turbo force is amazing it
[03:58:48.640 --> 03:58:54.280]  is but if you took it with fish oil it's like the fish oil is it the fish
[03:58:54.280 --> 03:58:57.360]  oil is better than that and that's an example of what I'm talking about fish
[03:58:57.360 --> 03:59:02.920]  oil is liquid energy brain body heart the cleanest the best out there you've
[03:59:02.920 --> 03:59:06.800]  got the children's you've got the adults got the krill oil if you're gonna get
[03:59:06.800 --> 03:59:09.960]  the full effect the fish oil and the children's are really strong they don't
[03:59:09.960 --> 03:59:13.120]  give you the burpees but krill oils is the best and it'll give you the damn
[03:59:13.120 --> 03:59:16.320]  burps and I'm sorry you want something like this you don't get stuff for free
[03:59:16.320 --> 03:59:20.360]  the krill is hallucinogenic it's so good it might be I'm not a medical
[03:59:20.360 --> 03:59:23.320]  statement here but let me tell you something I eat five can't put some
[03:59:23.320 --> 03:59:29.360]  krill oil before I go to bed I'm seeing Santa Claus that night so your brain is
[03:59:29.360 --> 03:59:37.440]  made basically out of what fish oil is so we don't make a big profit off of it
[03:59:37.440 --> 03:59:40.600]  but you know as I just obsessed because whatever the best is we've got I just
[03:59:40.600 --> 03:59:44.200]  can't lie to you I just can't do it
[03:59:44.200 --> 03:59:59.640]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
