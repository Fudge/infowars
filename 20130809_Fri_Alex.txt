[03:37.480 --> 03:46.720]  news is now confirmed this morning they said terror attacks in Austin Texas and
[03:46.720 --> 03:54.840]  then they named several other cities Pasadena California and that the terror
[03:54.840 --> 03:59.280]  attack could come anytime after the end of Ramadan that ended yesterday and
[03:59.280 --> 04:04.000]  that's why they announced in the news and you guys print me this from yesterday

[08:45.880 --> 08:48.320]  can do it if not it's there's so much important news I'll end up taping
[08:48.320 --> 08:56.000]  something tomorrow my great uncle the army officer fella that I've talked
[08:56.000 --> 09:01.240]  about on air died yesterday so I'm gonna go to that funeral I wish I would have
[09:01.240 --> 09:04.640]  gone and talked to him on his deathbed they weren't sure when he was gonna die
[09:04.640 --> 09:09.840]  but he's been real sick having trouble breathing that's what cigarettes will do
[09:09.840 --> 09:15.240]  to you and my dad was spent a lot of time with him but I hadn't should have
[09:15.240 --> 09:17.920]  gotten down there last week but he didn't want he didn't want family to
[09:17.920 --> 09:22.280]  come bug him so I'm gonna follow those wishes but that's a side issue it's just
[09:22.280 --> 09:27.520]  life is certainly very very short so I'm gonna go to his military funeral on
[09:27.520 --> 09:32.360]  Sunday and then I'll be back Sunday night and back live Monday Lord willing
[09:32.360 --> 09:39.040]  out out brief candle we never know how long we'll be here wow today is an
[09:39.040 --> 09:45.200]  absolute total abs just just just overload of information and I've got to
[09:45.200 --> 09:51.680]  do my best to try to cover it all I we aired this on the nightly news last
[09:51.680 --> 09:58.360]  night Jacari Jackson heard the police announcing we had a search warrant one
[09:58.360 --> 10:03.200]  of our reporters heard banging flash bangs going off about 15 20 minutes
[10:03.200 --> 10:06.720]  after when they had people in handcuffs he opens his door up of his apartment
[10:06.720 --> 10:12.240]  they scream at him like he's the lowest scum on earth you beyond an enemy come
[10:12.240 --> 10:16.960]  over tell him get back in his apartment he isn't his apartment slam the door on
[10:16.960 --> 10:23.800]  him with hatred and it just shows how the mindset of the police has changed in
[10:23.800 --> 10:26.720]  this country to something beyond what I've witnessed in third world nations
[10:26.720 --> 10:30.880]  even I mean they treat us worse than I've seen troops treating Iraqis on
[10:30.880 --> 10:38.200]  videos and and one time I saw state police on a side road a few years ago I
[10:38.200 --> 10:41.720]  talked about this my iPhone was dead you know I hadn't charged it so it was
[10:41.720 --> 10:45.680]  plugged in but hadn't booted up yet and I'm driving by and see like 10 state
[10:45.680 --> 10:52.360]  police with a little tent set up you know a little structure not really a tent
[10:52.360 --> 10:57.280]  you know it's where they a canopy and they're standing around and it's just a
[10:57.280 --> 11:03.240]  side street so I pull over knowing how uppity and when weird the police are
[11:03.240 --> 11:09.160]  getting I pulled down about 50 yards to another side street turned off part was
[11:09.160 --> 11:13.700]  dressed nice walked over and said hi how's it going as they all turned and
[11:13.700 --> 11:18.480]  looked at me I was like how's it going I'm walking up and wouldn't want to trench
[11:18.480 --> 11:22.720]  coat no excuse to act like I was some threat to them and I know I'm an insurgent
[11:22.720 --> 11:26.040]  all citizens police are taught are basically insurgents now enemies and
[11:26.040 --> 11:31.720]  there's terrorists under every rock and I said hey what's going on and the head
[11:31.720 --> 11:38.800]  DPS goes you get in your car and you get out of here and I went oh I what I'm a
[11:38.800 --> 11:43.280]  citizen I can't talk to you and he said I told you get in there and get out of
[11:43.280 --> 11:47.880]  here that's right there starts putting his hand on his gun and I went man this
[11:47.880 --> 11:51.720]  is really a screwed up country and some of the other state police were look at
[11:51.720 --> 11:56.520]  him like he was crazy but it doesn't matter the worst of the bunch always
[11:56.520 --> 12:02.080]  ended up running things he was in charge I just went you know I had a feeling
[12:02.080 --> 12:07.440]  you'd act like that he said I said hmm and I get a Napoleonic complex look a
[12:07.440 --> 12:13.720]  look like he was about 5'1 nothing to get short people I mean I'm only 5'10 but
[12:13.720 --> 12:20.120]  the whole point is is that I just see this everywhere I sent a reporter a
[12:20.120 --> 12:28.480]  film crew up to DC to get more shots of landmarks and they'd be 500 yards in the
[12:28.480 --> 12:35.800]  grass filming the White House or filming the Washington Monument this is
[12:35.800 --> 12:40.120]  yesterday and the police would come over and say you're not allowed to film
[12:40.120 --> 12:43.960]  you're not allowed to have a tripod and they're like well can you tell me the
[12:43.960 --> 12:51.120]  law please sir listen I'm gonna take you to jail that's the law and folks they
[12:51.120 --> 12:55.840]  do it so we don't make a documentary to little kids taking pictures if they want
[12:55.840 --> 13:01.680]  you to know buddy you're occupied this is Fallujah now of course they couldn't
[13:01.680 --> 13:04.840]  stay in Fallujah they got their butt ran out of there they couldn't stay in
[13:04.840 --> 13:08.920]  Afghanistan they got their butt right out of there but they're all gonna be
[13:08.920 --> 13:16.280]  here kicking us and stomping us forever and it doesn't matter if 90% of the
[13:16.280 --> 13:19.960]  police are changing people's tires and dealing with real bank robberies or
[13:19.960 --> 13:23.920]  robberies or problems it doesn't matter because it's the worst ones that they
[13:23.920 --> 13:28.520]  put to mind the general public and boss us around and I personally am not
[13:28.520 --> 13:33.000]  putting up with it anymore I've had a I mean I saw these footage of people all
[13:33.000 --> 13:36.760]  over the country trying to just hold up sign saying in Peach Obama and you see
[13:36.760 --> 13:39.480]  the footage the cops walk up to him this is the last few days we played some of
[13:39.480 --> 13:46.960]  it yesterday if you're a TV viewer and they would just shove down people start
[13:46.960 --> 13:50.760]  talking to him going hey I even check the local law I'm allowed to do this I
[13:50.760 --> 13:55.160]  said get out of here boom and the person's head hits the concrete and the
[13:55.160 --> 14:00.320]  cops also I mean you're assaulting us you're criminals I don't care if you
[14:00.320 --> 14:04.320]  got corrupt judges and a corrupt system and a corrupt media backing you up and
[14:04.320 --> 14:08.760]  I'm telling you folks from the top they're promoting and protecting bad
[14:08.760 --> 14:13.200]  police everywhere often has had a model police department I know my grandparents
[14:13.200 --> 14:18.280]  are from here my mom's from here I've lived here since high school visited
[14:18.280 --> 14:21.720]  during the summers compared to other cities and statistically it's been a
[14:21.720 --> 14:26.960]  model department as the city's gotten bigger and as they do all the modern
[14:26.960 --> 14:30.600]  training they're killing innocent people every couple weeks now because
[14:30.600 --> 14:34.000]  they're so scared that they're gonna get killed or shot at somebody gets out
[14:34.000 --> 14:36.680]  and has a cell phone on their hand boom you're dead look like a gun
[14:36.680 --> 14:40.480]  adjustable homicider some guy runs from the cops so they shoot him in the neck
[14:40.480 --> 14:45.800]  they're like justifiable I mean it's scary folks and the state police are all
[14:45.800 --> 14:49.160]  over the place now they're still they're pulling you over they're taking
[14:49.160 --> 14:53.720]  blood they'll they'll bend your wife over the cars or ramming their hands
[14:53.720 --> 14:59.480]  into their bodies I mean it is just a total and complete bizarro nightmare and
[14:59.480 --> 15:06.080]  it really freaks me out okay now that said that jacari video and audio is
[15:06.080 --> 15:09.240]  coming up your radio listener it's posted up at info wars.com you can go
[15:09.240 --> 15:12.800]  info wars.com forward slash show during the daytime show we put out a free
[15:12.800 --> 15:16.080]  video feed I don't know how long I can it's costing us a lot of money hundreds
[15:16.080 --> 15:20.040]  of thousands are watching in the day now and we haven't even got video ads up on
[15:20.040 --> 15:25.160]  it yet to pay for it but the point is we do have free video streams up at
[15:25.160 --> 15:33.080]  info wars.com forward slash show and the free podcast and audio feeds but this
[15:33.080 --> 15:36.800]  stuff really freaks me out because I want to say oh here's a police officer
[15:36.800 --> 15:40.720]  get buying a homeless person shoes or here's a police officer helping you
[15:40.720 --> 15:44.120]  know people get out of the river that are drowning or here's a hero firefighter
[15:44.120 --> 15:48.200]  or you know here's a good you know good job we want to do that and model good
[15:48.200 --> 15:53.040]  behavior but from the top of the globalists that run this country they
[15:53.040 --> 15:56.960]  want them a paramilitary force that sees us as the enemy and that's the bottom
[15:56.960 --> 16:00.840]  line training and the mayors and everybody call us civilians when they
[16:00.840 --> 16:04.880]  say it they get all sycophantic and smack their lips like they're the new
[16:04.880 --> 16:09.480]  royalty you're all civilians too and the military is not supposed to be
[16:09.480 --> 16:13.640]  operating domestically if it's real military and their servants as well and
[16:13.640 --> 16:18.160]  by the way it's honorable to be a real servant of the republic and the bill of
[16:18.160 --> 16:23.080]  rights of constitution I would not want to be called an official or an authority
[16:23.080 --> 16:27.320]  people calling tell me how great I am and it's like dumping coals on me folks
[16:27.320 --> 16:33.080]  because I'm not a narcissist I'm into ideas and a mission of freedom not to
[16:33.080 --> 16:37.560]  sit up here like some type of peacock putting my feathers out in front of you
[16:37.560 --> 16:46.280]  okay I'm I've transcended that by the time I was about 12 years old and we are
[16:46.280 --> 16:50.200]  going into classical charity and it hurts really bad to see this happening to
[16:50.200 --> 16:53.840]  our poor country we have the father of one of the Navy SEALs who was killed in
[16:53.840 --> 16:57.640]  cell team six joining us who's obviously coming out saying the evidence is foul
[16:57.640 --> 17:02.320]  play and a cover-up and most of the families are now coming out saying that

[24:16.800 --> 24:23.320]  transmission weeknight 7 o'clock central info wars nightly news I am your
[24:23.320 --> 24:32.920]  host Alex Jones coming to you from the info wars dot com news studios now my
[24:32.920 --> 24:37.600]  friends I've studied globalist operations I studied military operations
[24:37.600 --> 24:45.480]  I studied the Pentagon secret activities now for 16 plus years I I wasn't aware
[24:45.480 --> 24:49.000]  of this stuff for a year or two when I first got on air but I fell into it
[24:49.000 --> 24:53.520]  because they would have military drills paying off police chiefs shipping drugs
[24:53.520 --> 24:58.920]  in killing people and I would talk to police chiefs emergency managers
[24:58.920 --> 25:04.600]  military people I would get video of it and then people would say oh it's not
[25:04.600 --> 25:09.200]  real they would have national TV shows saying Alex Jones made up black
[25:09.200 --> 25:15.600]  helicopters you know tonight on hard copy actually on one of those shows they
[25:15.600 --> 25:18.680]  were pretty fair was it hard copy or extra still they made it into a whole
[25:18.680 --> 25:24.960]  tabloid deal so you have to understand most people go to the military they're
[25:24.960 --> 25:28.320]  compartmentalized I know more about this than the military and police do
[25:28.320 --> 25:32.800]  because they live in the most propagandized brainwashed world they
[25:32.800 --> 25:39.040]  don't CIA people Pentagon people even colonels and folks do not know what's
[25:39.040 --> 25:46.520]  really going on they live in an ocean of bull of Bravo Sierra I have reverse
[25:46.520 --> 25:50.160]  engineered it I have studied the congressional hearings where the stuffs
[25:50.160 --> 25:55.920]  come out and I've had the whistleblowers by the hundreds and hundreds and
[25:55.920 --> 26:02.320]  hundreds and hundreds on it just like I'm gonna have one of the fathers of one
[26:02.320 --> 26:08.880]  of the dead seal team six people coming on another whistleblower that's what I
[26:08.880 --> 26:14.720]  do so I want you to know this is not my opinion if you're in the police or the
[26:14.720 --> 26:18.440]  military because I'm talking to you more than I'm talking to the public the
[26:18.440 --> 26:21.800]  public on average unfortunately will have no idea what I'm even talking about
[26:21.800 --> 26:27.040]  you will because you live in this stuff so if you want to straight dope here's
[26:27.040 --> 26:32.720]  what's going on and I'm sure most of you already probably know this okay I have
[26:32.720 --> 26:36.960]  seen these many many times and I've been sent them by my sources and I know one
[26:36.960 --> 26:40.200]  of the sources that sent this to me I got it from a separate source as well
[26:40.200 --> 26:49.280]  through another source for official use only law enforcement sensitive Texas
[26:49.280 --> 26:55.720]  military forces J3 protection branch force protection alert by the way these
[26:55.720 --> 27:00.600]  guys are in plain clothes generic police uniforms they're involved in all
[27:00.600 --> 27:05.800]  forms of law enforcement warrants service you name it it's and I got those
[27:05.800 --> 27:16.960]  documents at a highway checkpoint in 1998 on Thanksgiving day Mike Hansen did
[27:16.960 --> 27:26.280]  technically my cameraman but this one is from two days ago and there's the phone
[27:26.280 --> 27:36.480]  number LTC Rob Eason AT officer there's the phone number threat analyst and with
[27:36.480 --> 27:43.000]  the police department and the army for official use only law enforcement now I
[27:43.000 --> 27:49.320]  put this out last night I was having dinner with friends before I went saw
[27:49.320 --> 27:55.640]  lesium it's the 1015 showing you know it opens like a day early of as long as the
[27:55.640 --> 28:00.040]  film ends after midnight they can play it so we're eating dinner at a Mexican
[28:00.040 --> 28:05.440]  food restaurant at about 9 o'clock and my source sends me info I call another
[28:05.440 --> 28:10.320]  source and then also confirmed through a separate it's actually three but one of
[28:10.320 --> 28:14.160]  them not known to me I checked with somebody else they said yeah we had that
[28:14.160 --> 28:19.640]  come through the point is that triple confirmed now it's confirmed in the news
[28:19.640 --> 28:22.960]  came out the news today and then the morning we put this out and of course
[28:22.960 --> 28:27.840]  the trolls are like it's not real it's not you know yesterday they announced oh
[28:27.840 --> 28:31.440]  my gosh there's gonna be drills over the city don't worry if you see the FBI the
[28:31.440 --> 28:38.040]  army checkpoints it's just a drill meanwhile line to the public the enemy
[28:38.040 --> 28:43.760]  meanwhile they told the Austin police and others that we we specifically think
[28:43.760 --> 28:47.600]  they're gonna attack 6th Street 7th Street 8th Street and then even named a
[28:47.600 --> 28:51.360]  church they thought it was gonna be blown up and then they were gonna attack the
[28:51.360 --> 28:56.320]  Austin Berkstrom Airport that I guess Drew Pearson's flying into right now
[28:56.320 --> 29:04.520]  comes he has so absolutely ridiculous let me explain what this is they send
[29:04.520 --> 29:09.680]  these out constantly if Obama got caught with a dead hooker there would be
[29:09.680 --> 29:13.000]  terror alerts all over the country and probably real bombs would go off as a
[29:13.000 --> 29:17.240]  diversion it came out that Clinton it got declassified to Congress launched
[29:17.240 --> 29:22.520]  attacks remember on Sudan on an aspirin factory when it came out he did have
[29:22.520 --> 29:27.760]  sex with Monica Lewinsky Governor Ridge wrote a book two years ago it may they
[29:27.760 --> 29:32.080]  put out fake terror alerts to divert the public when stuff came out of under
[29:32.080 --> 29:38.360]  Bush that's what this is but there's more to it and I'll explain that you have
[29:38.360 --> 29:43.040]  all the NSA news all the Obama corruption news all the Navy seal death
[29:43.040 --> 29:48.840]  news that's what this is but they may stage a false flag that could be in the

[33:25.200 --> 33:31.600]  and disinformation by the way I'm gonna get into their set to try to gut the
[33:31.600 --> 33:36.200]  country completely and bring in total globalism and bankrupt everything with

[33:49.040 --> 33:52.680]  tying it into Elysium you know I tried to give the film the benefit of the
[33:52.680 --> 33:58.680]  data beforehand was a big fan of District 9 even though it had its own
[33:58.680 --> 34:05.240]  political messages this film was incredibly well done this this director
[34:05.240 --> 34:12.480]  is a master and he is a total globalist pawn this was a piece of anti-white
[34:12.480 --> 34:24.080]  race war anti-American anti-free market anti-capitalist propaganda and again I
[34:24.080 --> 34:33.320]  mean the way it sells it you want to be a communist it's not that I side with
[34:33.320 --> 34:38.280]  the bad guys in the movie it's it's it's that it is a projected fraud and the
[34:38.280 --> 34:42.600]  fact that Matt Damon and the director would come out and say there's nothing
[34:42.600 --> 34:50.240]  political about this insulting insulting everyone but then Kurt Nemo found
[34:50.240 --> 34:54.720]  earlier statements were of course they admitted it was a open borders immigration
[34:54.720 --> 34:58.360]  reform propaganda they admitted that weeks ago so drudge had it up there
[34:58.360 --> 35:01.640]  where they were denying it Kurt found where they had already said it and then
[35:01.640 --> 35:05.000]  drudge posted that under there yesterday at drudgereport.com showing how
[35:05.000 --> 35:11.600]  they were lying I'll get to that but folks you know I'm all about unity and
[35:11.600 --> 35:15.800]  stuff but the so-called left is not gonna allow that okay and and they are the
[35:15.800 --> 35:21.680]  racist it's beyond that they're the technocrats but this was unbelievable the
[35:21.680 --> 35:27.560]  only good white guy in the movie is Matt Damon every other white person is an
[35:27.560 --> 35:34.960]  inhuman devil that has to be killed africaners Dutch whites are the are the
[35:34.960 --> 35:40.600]  are just demons I mean it is just I mean as you made a movie where all the bad
[35:40.600 --> 35:47.440]  guys are black people I mean that basically is what this is unbelievable so
[35:47.440 --> 35:52.280]  I'm going to give you a breakdown of Elysium and and the propaganda there as
[35:52.280 --> 35:58.280]  well now now let's continue here so they start announcing yesterday morning
[35:58.280 --> 36:02.720]  net you're gonna see some army FBI you're gonna see police you're gonna see
[36:02.720 --> 36:06.160]  some checkpoints they had some roads shut down traffic backed up in the
[36:06.160 --> 36:11.080]  morning yesterday that was in KXAN news and we had it up on info wars.com
[36:11.080 --> 36:16.040]  yesterday that there were drills in Austin which are just a condition
[36:16.040 --> 36:22.200]  everybody then I get this document last night make some phone calls and
[36:22.200 --> 36:26.360]  they're like yeah no we got that and more and of course I was told it's the
[36:26.360 --> 36:34.480]  normal absolute bull just pure federal fear mongering to divert and sell the
[36:34.480 --> 36:38.720]  idea the NSA spying on everyone I mean that is what both my army and state
[36:38.720 --> 36:43.960]  police source immediately concurred said oh yeah no one is buying it this is
[36:43.960 --> 36:51.040]  absolute bull now that's people that are in the know who who are get fed this
[36:51.040 --> 36:55.120]  stuff every day not all of it gets fed down to the junior police or even
[36:55.120 --> 36:59.560]  standard police this did now they're buying it of course because they only
[36:59.560 --> 37:03.960]  get fed this stuff a few times a year not every 10 minutes this is going out
[37:03.960 --> 37:07.640]  all over the country by the way they tell every city every big city you're the
[37:07.640 --> 37:11.240]  main target and they'll have some sister city and you're the only one to ever
[37:11.240 --> 37:14.320]  have these drills and you're the only one to ever have this threat it's like
[37:14.320 --> 37:18.160]  this specialness and you're really a secret federal agent now you'll even
[37:18.160 --> 37:21.240]  get some extra money you we need you to we need you to spy on the other police
[37:21.240 --> 37:24.280]  for us by the way you're you're now part of the club by the way here's some cash
[37:24.280 --> 37:28.880]  just don't tell anybody we gave you this it's all to compromise you if you're a
[37:28.880 --> 37:33.640]  police chief it could be 200 grand a year you're a captain it could be 50,000
[37:33.640 --> 37:39.560]  a year your sergeant plays ball well we're gonna give you some free hookers I
[37:39.560 --> 37:43.760]  mean this is how you corrupt people ancient Rome were experts at doing this
[37:43.760 --> 37:46.800]  you can watch the series Rome where they use people to corrupt folks that's
[37:46.800 --> 37:53.320]  actually true stories it's actually historical the point is is that what is
[37:53.320 --> 38:00.360]  behind all of this you have these J3 protection branch that's just the local
[38:00.360 --> 38:05.000]  one operating in every county in the country this is just one in Texas we
[38:05.000 --> 38:08.160]  got these documents because the FBI showed up at a checkpoint that we were
[38:08.160 --> 38:11.640]  filming and said here's the press release and then the guy drove off and we
[38:11.640 --> 38:15.800]  never knew if it was on purpose or an accident he gave us classified these are
[38:15.800 --> 38:21.800]  on info wars.com from 1998 they're in my film police state to the takeover is it
[38:21.800 --> 38:25.520]  police state one I forget you know showing the checkpoint showing the FBI
[38:25.520 --> 38:30.000]  getting out going to get out of here and it's like classified and says you know
[38:30.000 --> 38:35.000]  we do law enforcement raids warrants service bomb disposal checkpoints
[38:35.000 --> 38:43.320]  helicopter surveillance you know NSA intercepts I mean it's all there then I
[38:43.320 --> 38:46.440]  went to family that was involved in it in between doing special forces stuff
[38:46.440 --> 38:50.000]  overseas setting stuff up a decade ago and they're like don't ask me about that
[38:50.000 --> 38:56.720]  that's classified I'm not gonna get promoted cuz of you talking to me you
[38:56.720 --> 39:02.960]  know and then all right well they this doesn't even matter the point is folks
[39:02.960 --> 39:09.400]  this stuff is all going on all over the place there are troops in playing
[39:09.400 --> 39:13.800]  clothes all over the place it has nothing to do with 9-11 they trained to
[39:13.800 --> 39:18.520]  take on gun owners tea party your people and veterans and I told you that over a
[39:18.520 --> 39:24.040]  decade ago it's now in all the training manuals so what is behind this in the
[39:24.040 --> 39:29.880]  final equation it is about a clear distraction and a diversion but also a
[39:29.880 --> 39:34.400]  way to test federal compliance with local police and to see if they'll get
[39:34.400 --> 39:38.320]  into the mode of believing there's terrorists under every rock when the
[39:38.320 --> 39:42.720]  globalists actually run the real Al Qaeda and Taliban there's some real
[39:42.720 --> 39:47.000]  rogue groups out there as well but most of the time it's mind-controlled you
[39:47.000 --> 39:51.960]  know culturally religiously jihadis whose boss is really a globalist double
[39:51.960 --> 39:55.760]  agent who then orders them to carry out an attack so so they really think they're
[39:55.760 --> 40:02.240]  attacking the West all they're doing is allowing a simulant of a threat so
[40:02.240 --> 40:05.640]  there's a pretext to have those wars which are bottomless pits and trillions
[40:05.640 --> 40:10.520]  of no-bid contracts opium money laundering you name it and that's what
[40:10.520 --> 40:14.680]  Muhammad Karzai's come out and said that's what hami ghoul on this show the
[40:14.680 --> 40:19.040]  former head of Pakistani intelligence nobody can get him on folks
[40:19.040 --> 40:26.720]  when he comes on our show ran Osama bin Laden for the CIA beat the Russians the
[40:26.720 --> 40:30.440]  whole point is he goes absolutely that's what it is and it's not we're just
[40:30.440 --> 40:34.360]  agreeing on our world view that's veritas ladies and gentlemen that's the
[40:34.360 --> 40:38.800]  truth it stands on its own okay so there's foreign corporations funding
[40:38.800 --> 40:44.200]  Al Qaeda to attack us so they can take our liberties it's elementary it is
[40:44.200 --> 40:48.880]  elementary and what I'm saying here now is passé everyone pretty much knows
[40:48.880 --> 40:55.400]  this but remember when it was wild to say this type of stuff because when I
[40:55.400 --> 40:58.200]  talk about other incredible things you have to understand ladies gentlemen I
[40:58.200 --> 41:02.040]  know what I'm talking about and it's not because I'm even that smart I have
[41:02.040 --> 41:07.600]  embedded myself in reality I have dug into the real reality of what's going
[41:07.600 --> 41:14.440]  on just by dumb luck I happen to have family that's been involved in black
[41:14.440 --> 41:19.760]  ops and I've told you about that and and different activities so it's just I
[41:19.760 --> 41:26.240]  didn't grow up as naive as some of the general public I I natively understood a
[41:26.240 --> 41:30.160]  lot of this and it's time we realize what's going on I mean the police on
[41:30.160 --> 41:34.800]  the SWAT team outfit just dress up and they go fight drug dealers who are
[41:34.800 --> 41:39.320]  dealing drugs for the globalist who obviously didn't pay their cut or who
[41:39.320 --> 41:45.880]  are skimming that's all you are is a government enforcer over the monopoly
[41:45.880 --> 41:50.040]  that private interest have over narcotics that's why it's all such a joke
[41:50.040 --> 41:55.280]  the war on drugs all of it was a pretext to take over our country now we put
[41:55.280 --> 42:02.320]  this out last night with phone numbers it's now on ABC news NBC news you name
[42:02.320 --> 42:12.960]  it kicks and is reporting it and they come out this morning and go oh my
[42:12.960 --> 42:19.920]  goodness it's true there was a threat put out we were gonna be hit by terrorists
[42:19.920 --> 42:23.720]  but it was a mistake no it wasn't a mistake of course they don't give us
[42:23.720 --> 42:29.640]  credit it wasn't a mistake they lied to everyone they lied to the police they
[42:29.640 --> 42:34.600]  lied to the military about this this threat and then they lie to the public
[42:34.600 --> 42:37.520]  and told them that they weren't setting up checkpoints and things because of a
[42:37.520 --> 42:42.040]  threat when really all it was was a political diversion and a distraction
[42:42.040 --> 42:47.840]  from the things they were doing and a system to condition the public to accept
[42:47.840 --> 42:53.720]  martial law by increment so threat letter was sent out by mistake reported
[42:53.720 --> 42:58.280]  potential attack Thursday and Friday Texas military forces as a memo its
[42:58.280 --> 43:01.240]  command received about a potential terror threat in Austin was sent out by
[43:01.240 --> 43:05.600]  mistake you mean it was sent out secretly and I got a hold of it so now
[43:05.600 --> 43:09.520]  you've got to admit it's pure bull and of course we published an article last
[43:09.520 --> 43:13.840]  night saying it was a real memo but pure bull and now they admit it's a real
[43:13.840 --> 43:19.680]  memo and pure bull see for all the idiots in the comments going this isn't
[43:19.680 --> 43:24.000]  real what's he doing shooting videos at 1 a.m. working for your freedom dummy
[43:24.000 --> 43:30.080]  that's what I'm doing we don't make stuff up people are like there's no way
[43:30.080 --> 43:33.280]  that my homeland security says the number one threats veterans Alex put out a
[43:33.280 --> 43:39.440]  fake memo came out five days later it was real got no credit nationally it's
[43:39.440 --> 43:45.080]  just over and over and over again ladies and gentlemen and I just hope if they
[43:45.080 --> 43:48.320]  take me out somebody steps into our place who understands all this that's
[43:48.320 --> 43:52.320]  why I'm trying to lay out these basic stuff I mean this is this is not hard
[43:52.320 --> 43:58.760]  to figure out ladies and gentlemen so that's just some of the news on that
[43:58.760 --> 44:02.200]  front and here's some of the news that ties in with it Anthony Gutierrez he was
[44:02.200 --> 44:05.840]  gonna be on the nightly news tonight US military caught manipulating social
[44:05.840 --> 44:10.800]  media running mass propaganda accounts info wars.com mobile propaganda
[44:10.800 --> 44:14.520]  California government blast out text messages to all mobile phone users
[44:14.520 --> 44:19.400]  yeah anti-gun messages terror attack messages kidnapping messages to create
[44:19.400 --> 44:25.440]  fear to psychologically hijack your property and beyond 1984 big brother
[44:25.440 --> 44:30.320]  takes over your TV your smartphone bureaucrats at your door wanting to look
[44:30.320 --> 44:34.280]  around your house this is this is it I mean we're under psych warfare attack
[44:34.280 --> 44:39.760]  gotta push back don't don't become acclimated and go along with this folks
[44:39.760 --> 44:42.960]  because it's all about taking your bank accounts and imploding the country and
[44:42.960 --> 44:50.960]  getting rid of the middle class so that's the news on that front and it's
[44:50.960 --> 44:54.400]  all about a political diversion and getting us ready for when real events
[44:54.400 --> 44:58.120]  hit martial law and when they have these drills all the time they can get
[44:58.120 --> 45:02.000]  everybody out tell the public it's a drill and when something real detonates
[45:02.000 --> 45:06.920]  it's a drill their funding in case the government terrorist or contractors get
[45:06.920 --> 45:10.000]  caught with the bomb oh I was part of the drill but then when there's a real
[45:10.000 --> 45:14.880]  attack the cops all go oh it really was real see but we're not supposed to tell
[45:14.880 --> 45:18.480]  the public that's why we were out here look at Alex Jones saying it was a drill
[45:18.480 --> 45:23.400]  we know it was real no they cover it with a drill for the public or if
[45:23.400 --> 45:27.120]  anybody gets caught they tell the cops it's not really a drill and then they
[45:27.120 --> 45:31.240]  have a real terror attack like Boston then I said it'll come out the pats
[45:31.240 --> 45:35.280]  these are CIA and it'll come out that and they'll probably kill them and they'll
[45:35.280 --> 45:39.120]  kill their friends and family to cover it up and all that by the way of course
[45:39.120 --> 45:51.520]  happened because it's standard operating procedure procedure okay that's how
[45:51.520 --> 45:56.440]  this works I know it's fun to have dress up and pretend you're warriors in the
[45:56.440 --> 46:01.320]  homeland and there's terrorists buying everything you know that's all bull you
[46:01.320 --> 46:06.160]  know that's all baloney it's a pretext to destroy the republic and with it all
[46:06.160 --> 46:13.600]  of our freedoms and then that will mean our prosperity I want to do an Elysium

[54:00.600 --> 54:17.760]  all right folks again I want to explain something they sell everything in this
[54:17.760 --> 54:26.440]  culture like it's cowboys redskins Steelers versus the 49ers it's all us
[54:26.440 --> 54:32.560]  against them it is very simple people buy into it and that's what basically
[54:32.560 --> 54:38.920]  Elysium does it is a very powerful film very entertaining and very deep on
[54:38.920 --> 54:46.640]  multiple levels that said it is globalist propaganda to have people
[54:46.640 --> 54:54.080]  identify basically racially with socialism and collectivism as the
[54:54.080 --> 55:00.520]  Latin American population doubles to take over North America politically as
[55:00.520 --> 55:04.720]  part of the North American Union that is in the SPP plan but not to bring
[55:04.720 --> 55:10.480]  freedom to Latin America to bring down the entire system and make sure there's
[55:10.480 --> 55:18.080]  no middle-class only a tiny ultra elite like you have in Latin America over the
[55:18.080 --> 55:25.320]  rest but it sells it like every white person is a murderous evil robot that
[55:25.320 --> 55:32.360]  feeds on the angel Hispanics and angel black people and the only good white
[55:32.360 --> 55:37.280]  person is really Hispanic himself he just looks you know what you'd call you
[55:37.280 --> 55:46.120]  know like pure quote Anglo and that's Matt Damon and he sacrifices himself as
[55:46.120 --> 55:52.800]  the Christ figure because of the evil white people I mean it is unbelievable
[55:52.800 --> 55:59.520]  and it's anti-European it's anti Dutch it's anti French America is basically
[55:59.520 --> 56:04.680]  Elysium and Germany and France and England and has subliminals in it I
[56:04.680 --> 56:09.280]  gotta go see it again I mean and take notes and not when it's midnight you
[56:09.280 --> 56:17.360]  know the first showing because I was also tired it was unbelievably evil it
[56:17.360 --> 56:20.760]  has Mark of the Beast that's a genetic tattoo that everybody wants to get so it
[56:20.760 --> 56:27.480]  sells that idea it sells transhumanism as the way to go it is incredible but it
[56:27.480 --> 56:31.680]  is a masterpiece beyond District 9 and that was his first big film this guy is
[56:31.680 --> 56:36.400]  certainly an amazing artist but but and but but and of course he's a white guy
[56:36.400 --> 56:42.120]  as well a Neil Blumkamp Blumkamp
[56:43.000 --> 56:47.840]  amazing and Kurt Nemo's article is accurate because they admitted about a
[56:47.840 --> 56:51.240]  month ago yeah it's about immigration about borders worldwide hey can I have
[56:51.240 --> 56:56.680]  open borders to Mexico oh no I can't go there oh hey can I go to you know can I
[56:56.680 --> 57:00.520]  go move in Japan and immigrate there not about a million dollars I mean it's
[57:00.520 --> 57:05.080]  just they have homeland defense robots so it also has a message saying Homeland
[57:05.080 --> 57:09.280]  Security's a tyranny and it also admits that there's an elite that's gonna have
[57:09.280 --> 57:12.880]  live extension technologies and you're not gonna have it so it has a lot of
[57:12.880 --> 57:18.960]  truths in it but it says communism will give you all the free goodies when all
[57:18.960 --> 57:23.760]  it deploys as a nightmare and that it's racial and that white people are bad so
[57:23.760 --> 57:28.120]  the film is incredibly dangerous I gotta go see it again and just take notes I
[57:28.120 --> 57:39.840]  mean it it is the new level of propaganda Blumkamp Neil Blumkamp is makes
[57:39.840 --> 57:46.560]  Joseph Goebbels look like a lobotomized rat I mean this was just propaganda
[57:46.560 --> 57:52.720]  hammer and also the black ops teams when they're in live satellite stuff
[57:52.720 --> 57:56.120]  they're blurred out even as they're killing people just like Google blurs out
[57:56.120 --> 57:58.800]  when you I mean it had a lot of subtle stuff in it
[57:58.800 --> 58:06.480]  jacarjax and who went with us he picked up the mark of the beast stuff it was
[58:06.480 --> 58:12.440]  truly amazing and it also sells you know kind of a scum gangster Latino culture
[58:12.440 --> 58:16.440]  as if that's the Hispanic culture it's it tries to brand that that that's the
[58:16.440 --> 58:21.920]  cool thing doing drugs partying you know that's really tough and wonderful as so
[58:21.920 --> 58:27.080]  like ms-13's really sexy so it was also meaning to brand a gang culture for
[58:27.080 --> 58:32.400]  Hispanics as a psychological warfare weapon to hurt them it was this guy
[58:32.400 --> 58:37.000]  made me the front guy I mean this this this this had armies of psychiatrists
[58:37.000 --> 58:40.240]  and people working on it
[58:40.240 --> 58:52.360]  this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network introducing pro one all

[01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:12.080]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:19.600]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCM radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:30.400]  Alex Jones he's just joined us I'm gonna finish up with my Elysium review and the
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:37.360]  we're gonna get Larry claiming the lawyer who I know well on with the father
[01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:42.640]  of one of the heroic Navy SEALs who died in SEAL Team 6 the father of Michael
[01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:48.840]  strange Charles strange is going to be joining us by the way I I went to the
[01:00:48.840 --> 01:01:00.140]  film with Darren McBreen, Marcos Morales, Kit Daniels, Shane Steiner, myself,
[01:01:00.140 --> 01:01:04.400]  Jacari Jackson so you know there was Hispanic folks there black guy there
[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:07.960]  white guys there whatever all just human beings friends everybody agreed yeah
[01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:11.880]  no the white guys are the bad guy Europeans of the bad guys white South
[01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:15.720]  Africans are really the bad guys in the future hundreds of years from now and
[01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:20.160]  the only good white guy is Matt Damon because he kills himself for the Latin
[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:24.120]  Americans that basically are living down here in the United States and my old
[01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:28.800]  question is if Mexico and stuff so bad and America is basically Elysium that's
[01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:35.200]  the analogy well then I mean why is Mexico so bad why is Brazil so bad
[01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:39.480]  because they've been under globalist type operations and the globalist are
[01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:45.680]  trying to duplicate that here and the globalists see the numbers the world's
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:48.920]  what you'd call seven percent white was just nine percent just a decade ago
[01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:53.640]  it'll be like three percent within another 30 50 years the effect is
[01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:58.560]  predictive that quote white Caucasians will be extinct within 100 years there
[01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:01.800]  will be no white people and they teach in college that's good get rid of them
[01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:06.600]  we're bad you know whatever you do and my whole issue is is that I'm sitting
[01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:11.480]  here as a white guy being told I'm just inherently evil but the only reason
[01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:14.880]  that's happening is the globalist are trying to play our countries off against
[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:18.720]  each other they're trying to play our religions off race off all that in the
[01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:23.400]  name of fighting racism they're selling it and pushing it and this is hard core
[01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:28.480]  branding for all Latin Americans that all the whites are out to get you and
[01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:32.760]  they don't want to share the stuff they've got with you so let's say we kill
[01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:37.400]  all the white people get rid of all those business owners I mean it just
[01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:43.200]  what if I wasn't here and I got people of all quote races they're all just
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:47.440]  human beings working here I mean well will that help them if I was gone would
[01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:50.320]  it help somebody if I didn't go to say Hispanic owned restaurant without help
[01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:56.160]  him if the gringos dead I mean this is unbelievable ladies and gentlemen this
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:03:00.840]  is kill all the gringos and then 20 billion people can go live on a space
[01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:07.680]  station that a hundred thousand can live on and then it makes getting a life
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:11.760]  extension technology getting real technological equity it makes it a
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:18.600]  communist Latin American thing they sell communism and collectivism based on
[01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:26.880]  liberation theology racism as the way to get ahead and so if we take billions
[01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:32.680]  of people into the US and give them all free welfare because the archetype is
[01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:38.600]  just a machine just heals you just hate we'll take your business like in Cuba
[01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:42.280]  and then it'll be a paradise well no that doesn't happen and this is all
[01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:48.000]  financed by ultra rich that are exempt and are offshore and Google funds all
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:52.280]  this open border stuff while they're building floating cities and space
[01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:56.400]  stations that they say they're actually building a lesium and they're using our
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:04:01.320]  money to build it and they're gonna all have us fight with each other you don't
[01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:05.080]  fix the world with new science new inventions new technology coming together
[01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:10.140]  around a culture of liberty no no no you you fix it by with gang tattoos and
[01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:15.720]  drinking and smoking pot and killing white people and and and and and just
[01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:18.560]  you know there's religion in it with the nun speaking to him you're gonna
[01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:23.520]  change the world I mean it is pure liberation theology probably foundation
[01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:33.480]  written this is unbelievable just how I mean I'm against birth of a nation the
[01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:38.280]  famous Ku Klux Klan film I protested the Ku Klux Klan but they have nothing I
[01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:42.760]  mean Ku Klux Klan can't tie their shoe laces ladies and gentlemen this is an
[01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:46.840]  anti-white movie but it's okay because as long as it's you can be anything you
[01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:51.360]  want as long as it's anti-white but you can't criticize anybody else for what
[01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:55.720]  they're doing the only racism is whites and the message is you kill them you
[01:04:55.720 --> 01:05:01.880]  save the world this is a racist degenerate movie every three seconds

[01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:34.520]  gentlemen we're into the second hour on this Friday edition and we're gonna
[01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:41.400]  cover a really serious issue here for the balance of the hour you know about
[01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:45.200]  still team six and the bin Laden raid and you know that 20 plus Navy SEALs
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:48.840]  and other personnel were crammed on a helicopter under very mysterious
[01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:52.400]  circumstances and that clearly the record of that has been covered up by the
[01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:55.760]  Obama administration they've had a lot of high-level military people come out
[01:08:55.760 --> 01:09:01.760]  and speak out early on my father's friends of the gentleman whose son we've
[01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:05.680]  known for over a decade is in another SEAL team and his friends with people in
[01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:09.800]  SEAL team six his best friends in that and I told you just about a few weeks
[01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:13.200]  after it happened that they thought it was very suspicious I'm on record we
[01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:17.560]  wrote articles about it but he wouldn't come on air and his friend in SEAL team
[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:20.880]  six said they're under orders they obviously can't even give us info just
[01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:26.040]  that they thought that they were set up was the words and that did get out there
[01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:28.560]  that's pretty big news when we even said that because folks know we don't make
[01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:31.680]  things up well since then you've seen this stuff start to come out as the
[01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:34.880]  families have had the courage to talk about it because this is very dangerous
[01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:38.760]  you can end up like Michael Hastings covering stuff like this Larry Klayman
[01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:41.720]  who's been coming on the show for I don't know 15 years the founder of Judicial
[01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:45.240]  Watch has just broken some of the most important stories out there dealing with
[01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:49.360]  government corruption is gonna do us for about 15 minutes that he's got to go
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:52.480]  and then for the rest of the hour we're gonna be riding shotgun with a gentleman
[01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:56.480]  who's also there Charles Strange and the father of a Michael Strange one of the
[01:09:56.480 --> 01:10:00.440]  22 Navy SEALs killed in the August 6 2011 when the Chinook helicopter
[01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:06.200]  mysteriously went down and there's the Michael Strange Foundation.org and
[01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:11.040]  Facebook it's a forward slash Michael Strange Foundation everybody be sure and
[01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:15.520]  get behind that by the way we've had our accounts suspended and other people
[01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:19.600]  hundreds of people we documented a few months ago or even last year
[01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:23.160]  when this first started getting attention if you put a meme out or an
[01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:27.760]  article about this they they block it so and we it turned out the White House is
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:32.840]  involved in that so they don't want these families being hurt but we're on
[01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:40.400]  over 160 AM and FM stations XM global shortwave WWCR 600,000 downloads the
[01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:44.480]  podcast today so like it or not this is about to get out Larry claiming I want
[01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:49.600]  you to open this up and bring Mr. Strange in here and set the table but
[01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:53.200]  I'd like to just recap what we know happened versus what we're being told
[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:57.240]  and why I was told right after it happened by a member of SEAL team three
[01:10:57.240 --> 01:11:02.120]  I'll just say it that most the SEALs he talked to said quote we know it was a
[01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:07.040]  setup what is the setup then and what is the cover up Larry claiming thank you
[01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:11.880]  for coming on today with Charles Strange you bet well here's the scenario
[01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:18.080]  Alex is that shortly after Bin Laden was killed the administration obviously wanted
[01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:21.760]  to crawl about it for political purposes and claim credit and give
[01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:24.760]  information to make them sound credible like they were no they were talking
[01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:29.840]  about so as vice president Biden and defense secretary Leanne Panetta at the
[01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:34.160]  time that revealed SEAL team six was the group that killed Bin Laden I was like
[01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:38.480]  putting a target on their backs and we represent several of the families that
[01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:43.120]  they can tell you that after that happened their sons were very scared not
[01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:47.760]  just for themselves over there in Afghanistan but for the families that
[01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:53.440]  there would be retaliation now fast forward to August 6th 2011 we just went
[01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:57.000]  by that date that anniversary date and the flag was blown over the Capitol in
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:02.200]  honor thanks to congressman Trent Banks for the SEALs and other special
[01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:06.920]  ops that died but what happened is that they knew we have a report and Charlie
[01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:11.080]  will tell you more about that that they were going that the Taliban was laying
[01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:17.560]  in wait shoot down an American helicopter presumably special ops forces in the
[01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:22.280]  Tangin Valley over a hundred and they sent this mission in there without
[01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:28.360]  adequate preparation without pre-assault fire which ordinarily you'd have to
[01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:37.120]  prevent you know response they went in there to fight a battle you have seven
[01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:41.320]  Afghanis because we share these missions with the Afghans for some unknown
[01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:44.880]  reason because we want to reach out to the Muslims over there they're on the
[01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:48.880]  missions they substitute them out seven of them right before the flight no one
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:53.160]  knows who's inserted there's no lifting of it on the manifest so the
[01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:58.200]  possibility exists that these Afghanis are the ones that assisted in breaching
[01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:01.200]  security and that's what I was told a few weeks after as they thought somebody
[01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:04.920]  got a bomb on board but I mean how obvious is that they want to get rid of
[01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:08.000]  these SEALs they know the truth about the bin Laden raid they send them out
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:13.200]  where the Taliban's lying in wait and from what I heard that from the people
[01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:15.920]  in SEAL Team 6 but obviously Charles gonna know more about this than anybody
[01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:20.320]  that they thought there was something on board the aircraft is that true mr.
[01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:26.760]  strange that's why we're looking for this special investigation find out you
[01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:35.800]  know was it a bomber on their suicide bomb or was it a man-packed they told
[01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:41.680]  us you know they used the term lucky shot I told them if it was lucky shot they
[01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:50.400]  would have missed with an RPG with a man padded to the heat seeking missile so
[01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:56.760]  long we had up and I I've heard that from the teams to okay go ahead Larry after
[01:13:56.760 --> 01:14:01.560]  the crash occurs after the crash occurs they can't find the so-called black box
[01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:06.160]  that would tell us how it happens they claim there was a flash flood it washed
[01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:10.640]  it away well you know there hasn't been a flood over there since Noah's Ark how's
[01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:15.440]  there a flash flood you know I mean a little facetious they do have them
[01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:20.960]  everything on them but not very often you have the body of Michael strange which
[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:25.400]  was intact we have the photographs it was cremated without getting Charlie's
[01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:32.320]  permission at Charlie's a Christian you know Christians don't cremate fallen
[01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:36.600]  heroes like like Michael and why did they have to do that they brought the
[01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:40.920]  seven Afghani bodies back to Dover Air Force Base they were on that chopper
[01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:45.680]  why bringing the Afghans back to the United States to our armed forces instant
[01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:51.600]  pathology what is potentially being covered up and last but not least in
[01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:57.280]  terms of to summarize this at the ramp ceremony or Michael and the other fallen
[01:14:57.280 --> 01:15:02.800]  seals and special ops forces a Muslim cleric and you can find this on our
[01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:10.400]  website it's freedom watch USA dot org I'm now running freedom watch and Muslim
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:16.120]  cleric dams anyone who doesn't believe in Allah to hell as infidels they're
[01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:22.760]  giving a prayer over our special ops forces why and you know this is these
[01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:26.560]  are all questions need to be answered we succeeded in triggering a congressional
[01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:31.160]  inquiry into this and the government oversight reform committee we have a
[01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:35.360]  lawsuit pending as well so we want to get to the bottom of it but this is a
[01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:40.040]  scandal I think which will ultimately prove to be bigger than Benghazi because
[01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:46.400]  God forbid I mean you had four souls killed tragically at Benghazi but here
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:50.840]  you know you had 30 Americans killed and Americans continue to be killed
[01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:55.560]  because they're not allowed to engage the Muslims over there but we have to be
[01:15:55.560 --> 01:16:00.400]  nice to them we can't fire unless we're fired upon first give them a chance to
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:04.240]  lay down and that's a large part of what went on here is there was not
[01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:10.160]  sufficient preparation to go in and fight this battle Larry Clemens our guest he's
[01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:15.800]  the lawyer working with Charles strange you know Charles I have one son and he's
[01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:21.160]  10 years old and I have two daughters I just cannot imagine I almost feel even
[01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:24.600]  disrespectful even talking about this but I know we've got to talk about it so
[01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:27.880]  the truth comes out to just sit here and casually talk about your son's death
[01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:30.760]  while you're sitting here but I know you've been living with this now for a
[01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:35.200]  year and a half or so it just tears my guts out with empathy to imagine it and
[01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:39.960]  then to clearly look at this and there's clearly foul play clearly a cover up and
[01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:45.320]  then they've got a a mom basically cursing over them at the everything
[01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:50.080]  Obama does is really to defile Christianity they've turned Syria over to
[01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:53.880]  Al Qaeda and Libya and they're targeting Christians and that's being covered up by
[01:16:53.880 --> 01:16:57.720]  the media I mean I used to hear this stuff about Obama maybe some radical
[01:16:57.720 --> 01:17:02.000]  Muslim like oh give me a break but I tell you these people act like the worst
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:06.000]  of villains I've ever heard of where do I mean how are you dealing with this sir
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:10.320]  I know you're fighting back and what was your son want to say right now if he was
[01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:18.400]  here with us Michael would say don't stop that find out that Michael's home in
[01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:23.920]  June 2011 for his birthday and for the first time in eight years that he was
[01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:28.560]  with special ops he talked about a will he grabbed me by the pie step three
[01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:32.640]  times and he said that I should what's going on he said that I'm not effing
[01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:38.160]  around and he stopped in my sister's house and Maggie's we love to talk to her
[01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:44.840]  about a well and some somebody was leaking something one of these higher ups
[01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:50.880]  does it go up to Obama I'm not sure but he was just Obama was just watching
[01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:54.800]  him up you know watching them guys 93 days ago right when they killed been
[01:17:54.800 --> 01:18:01.680]  lying so all sudden 93 days later my son killed he's home in June tell me about
[01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:06.120]  a will and then only other man a lot of the other man you one guy used to kiss
[01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:09.280]  his mom on top of the head and then he kissed her on the lips one guy used to
[01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:12.760]  tell his dad keep all the beer cold this time he grabs him by the shoulders and
[01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:16.600]  tells him how much he loves them and the way he raised them so there was weeks
[01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:21.040]  going on it goes all the way up to the top it was definitely a set up ambush
[01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:28.280]  you know when they were flying in there there was a tower 50 foot high and they
[01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:31.640]  called up and they asked you know what's with the tower with these two guys on
[01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:38.320]  there and the Afghan administration answers their hanging crops two o'clock in
[01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:44.080]  the morning and supposedly if there was a shot it was coming from there they
[01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:52.560]  were surrounded there was so many Taliban there sure that there was over a
[01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:57.000]  hundred Taliban well that's exactly what I was told a few weeks after and then
[01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:00.640]  now it's all come out that they they even knew they're like we're being sent in
[01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:04.800]  this is obviously looking at the mission they knew it wasn't a real mission they
[01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:08.840]  knew it was a setup and that and that it was a trap because that's what they do
[01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:14.320]  is plan missions and the way they were sardine on on a piece of junk helicopter
[01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:18.400]  as well that I mean nothing was following standard procedure is that what
[01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:26.560]  you basically have gleaned sir yes absolutely and I have to you know August
[01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:32.880]  2011 August 6th and then October of 2011 General Colport all the families
[01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:38.160]  down to Little Creek for the investigation report and I was raising
[01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:42.040]  my hand you know you talked about your son if somebody murdered your son you'd
[01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:45.640]  be raising what you want to know who and the questions and they said it went
[01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:48.680]  through a chain of command for the land decide I raised my hand I took out
[01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:52.680]  them names and his neck snapped and he paced back and forth and all the big
[01:19:52.680 --> 01:19:57.840]  waves are up there all the four stars and he said it's in the book sir I said
[01:19:57.840 --> 01:20:02.840]  about an after-action report it's in the book sir he talks a little bit I said
[01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:07.040]  what happened to the black box which is really orange and General Colport raises
[01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:13.280]  both hands a flat flood came and washed it away I said you got to be kidding me
[01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:17.040]  but anyway they give me this book you don't look at it because you just
[01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:21.360]  everybody's son getting murdered and they give me a desk and I come home I
[01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:25.880]  open the book up there's no ink Mr. Jones there's no ink no toner you can't
[01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:32.360]  read it I call the commander Admiral Sean Pivots I said Sean I can't read this
[01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:36.920]  he said well we got complaints about that I said all right send me another one he
[01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:42.040]  said we can't we burned it absolutely that's how you do it you give him the
[01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:46.000]  fake book so that oh we didn't know so you wouldn't make a scene the other
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:52.000]  families wouldn't make scenes this is incredible this is organized well I put
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:56.960]  the disk in and you can barely read that and I said to my wife Michael step mom I
[01:20:56.960 --> 01:21:00.360]  said we got to do something with this we got to do something with this thing
[01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:03.640]  there's like a hundred with a box on there and you click it and then you click
[01:21:03.640 --> 01:21:08.000]  it again then you click it a third time and she said let's burn it out and we
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:13.200]  printed it out Mr. Jones thirteen hundred some pages and it tells you
[01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:18.280]  everything about the ambush about quarry tie here lefty groves the name of the
[01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:22.000]  object how he moved that he moved Mr. Jones the day before
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:27.720]  well it is most Taliban buddies to another village it tells you everything
[01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:36.440]  the one guy general code sd guy yeah he has the fire control officer oh well it
[01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:39.600]  went on with this top and the guy answers and I'm picking right from my
[01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:44.720]  paperwork it was not kind of not a normal op for us the lock both of our
[01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:48.840]  sensors down at two different locations because it's kind of asking us to be
[01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:55.720]  rentable I mean that was hard for us as well because we haven't had eyes on our
[01:21:55.720 --> 01:22:01.760]  eyes or somewhere else and that came from up above our hands were tied from up
[01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:07.600]  above who was the guy commander that tied their hands unbelievable contract while
[01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:13.200]  we're talking to the father of slain Navy Seal hero Michael strange Charles
[01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:16.960]  strange and we've got Larry claiming on the line with us Larry's got to go in
[01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:20.400]  about six seven minutes but Charles strange is going to be able to stay
[01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:24.000]  with us for the rest of the hour and even perhaps take some of your phone
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:28.080]  calls and questions you've got especially if your former Navy Seal or
[01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:32.640]  somebody from the Navy or special ops Delta Force Green Berets Army Rangers
[01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:36.720]  on down the line because you can probably ask better questions than I can out
[01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:40.840]  there but Larry claiming that in the time we have left with you then we'll go
[01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:45.600]  back to Mr. Strange other points that are important to add here I mean I'm no
[01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:50.520]  rocket scientist but I know how cover-ups work I look at this A to Z it
[01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:54.120]  looks like they wanted those guys dead and send them in and set them up and
[01:22:54.120 --> 01:22:59.880]  that's what the Navy Seals I've talked to say so the question is why get rid of
[01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:08.000]  them well the big question Alex is was this payback for Osama bin Laden being
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:12.000]  killed it helmet Karzai the president of Afghanistan of course he's only the
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:17.480]  president of Kabul Taliban rules the rest of the country did he offer them up to
[01:23:17.480 --> 01:23:22.080]  pay homage to the Taliban that's a possibility so it's a deal it's in our
[01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:26.960]  own so it's a deal okay we kill your guy now we get to kill your guys back it's
[01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:33.440]  that whole tribal blood debt thing absolutely and I you know I hate to
[01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:38.040]  say this and it is speculative it's extremely speculative but in our own
[01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:42.040]  people offer them up that's another question too and all of these questions
[01:23:42.040 --> 01:23:47.400]  need to be investigated and found out and acted upon there's a lot of money
[01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:51.680]  that's going in different directions over there as a drug trade people can get
[01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:56.520]  very rich there are other motivations perhaps as well and you know and again
[01:23:56.520 --> 01:24:02.280]  without making any kind of accusation when we're rolling over to these jihadists
[01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:06.960]  when we're more concerned about the lives of Muslims than we are the lives of
[01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:13.680]  Christians and Jews and others when we bow down to the king of Saudi Arabia in
[01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:19.240]  effect bow down to the Taliban and can't fire unless we're fired upon first
[01:24:19.240 --> 01:24:23.760]  as a general rule you know they are some serious questions here so Charlie and
[01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:29.280]  others are coming forward not just a respect and honor to their great son
[01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:34.000]  we died for us but for those servicemen who are now being sent into harm's way
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:38.680]  and who are frightened to death and these brave people only because they can't
[01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:43.920]  defend themselves and they're they're dropping like flies and more people would
[01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:48.520]  have been killed per capita in Afghanistan and even in Iraq or in
[01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:54.480]  Vietnam the casualty rate is huge because we want to make nice nice with the
[01:24:54.480 --> 01:25:01.560]  Muslims over there that's the bottom line let me ask you this question to
[01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:08.440]  Charles Strange the father sir what does your gut tell you of having all the facts
[01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:12.160]  but then your gut I mean I remember when I heard about this my gut said I bet
[01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:15.480]  they're getting rid of people that know too much and then it all came out I mean
[01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:23.920]  what does your gut tell you my gut tells me that cars die somebody from the
[01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:30.600]  Afghan administration set this up with someone very high in our government
[01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:35.560]  without it that's that's what my guts tell me and from Michael Michael was a
[01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:41.760]  cryptologist he's from the dev group he was special ops and it's how they made
[01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:46.480]  seal team six was guys from the dev group special ops combined with the Navy
[01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:53.120]  Seals to make the most elite team in the world seal team six the best and he was
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:58.720]  sealed team six and for four years and he could Michael as a cryptologist he
[01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:04.840]  just got an award he got the National Intelligence Medal of Vapour there's
[01:26:04.840 --> 01:26:11.200]  only been 19 of them him and Jared day he was number 19 ever received that for
[01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:15.920]  what he knew and what he could do and physically he was 2% body fat Michael
[01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:20.160]  could run from here to Canada from Billy to Canada with a bottle of James's in
[01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:28.360]  his hand you know he was remarkable but he knew he trusted them guys and for me
[01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:33.240]  to download these papers with Michael's stepmom and then to read that Nate
[01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:37.840]  10th a hundred Taliban are coming to the Tangine Valley to kill him and then
[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:43.600]  nobody says nothing for this guy quality tire to move the day before it's on the
[01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:49.880]  paperwork this was a setup if you're gonna tell me they're gonna tell me it
[01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:55.480]  was a lucky shot you know they're gonna tell me they were gonna ask for that
[01:26:55.480 --> 01:26:59.360]  this back mr. Jones wanted a parent stone the next day they were gonna ask
[01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:04.480]  all the parents for this back and now I'm on my wife figured out how to print
[01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:08.520]  it out and we read all this information that's all I've been doing it's big
[01:27:08.520 --> 01:27:14.720]  Tuesday was two years wow it's just easy up that's right it's been two years I
[01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:18.160]  was saying a year and a half well we just had the anniversary time just time
[01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:22.520]  just flies Larry we're gonna come back and let mr. Charles Strange lay all this
[01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:26.560]  out but I wanted and also talk about the Michael Strange Foundation or people
[01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:29.440]  should support that but in the few minutes we've got left what else is
[01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:33.520]  important for people to know about where this investigation is going and how
[01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:37.440]  they can support the families to get justice
[01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:45.840]  follow us on freedom watch USA dot org freedom watch USA dot org in addition to
[01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:51.720]  Charlie's Foundation because we're very active in this matter and things are
[01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:57.680]  growing more families are coming to us the Congress is sincere I gotta take my
[01:27:57.680 --> 01:28:01.880]  hat off and I'm not just saying this because you know I'm a skeptic but we
[01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:06.600]  spent two and a half hours with Darrell I said a few weeks ago and chase and
[01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:09.800]  chase it so the government oversight reform committee and they're very
[01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:13.760]  dedicated here and they're seeking to get whites were there are some Democrats
[01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:19.680]  that will probably come on board to yeah this has got to make Obama worry what
[01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:22.800]  do you think haven't been gauzy that looks like the same deal getting rid of
[01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:26.240]  people that know too much because you're given each seeking missiles to Al Qaeda I
[01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:29.720]  knew that right when it happened for my military sources now that's actually
[01:28:29.720 --> 01:28:35.560]  come out as possible some of those he's thinking missiles found their way into
[01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:39.640]  Afghanistan that's something needs to be investigated but this is bigger than
[01:28:39.640 --> 01:28:43.600]  Benghazi ultimately and because we're fighting more wars in the Middle East
[01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:47.720]  and we need to be able to change the rules of engagement that's one of our
[01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:52.000]  primary objectives so our military can defend themselves do you think Obama's
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:55.760]  concerned I mean I'm sure you've seen the censorship of these stories on
[01:28:55.760 --> 01:29:00.840]  Facebook and are you aware of that Larry they're trying to shut down articles
[01:29:00.840 --> 01:29:04.400]  about this being passed around on Facebook
[01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:07.600]  well they're trying to shut everything down Alex I have two lawsuits against
[01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:13.320]  Obama and the NSA in fact Charlie's a plaintiff and both of them you know we're
[01:29:13.320 --> 01:29:18.120]  living in a world where the government wants to either spy upon us or have us
[01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:23.160]  believe that to intimidate us to keep us down and it's a serious situation in my
[01:29:23.160 --> 01:29:26.720]  life time in years as well and the American people and this is quite
[01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:31.280]  beyond this particular matter it is crazy Larry claiming Larry thank you so

[01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:35.840]  that's passed recently just the anniversary of the still team six folks
[01:33:35.840 --> 01:33:41.160]  crammed on a helicopter flown out into a clear ambush and and sir I know it's
[01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:44.320]  hard to talk about but but it's important to get the true story from what
[01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:48.760]  you've been able to you dig up from sources and it's even come out in the
[01:33:48.760 --> 01:33:52.720]  news as well now that indeed there's been a cover-up of what happened to your son
[01:33:52.720 --> 01:33:57.680]  Michael strange and those other men so so so walk through what we know about the
[01:33:57.680 --> 01:34:01.720]  mission what unfolded you've I want to try to give you the floor here to tell
[01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:07.040]  me what you were telling me during the last break about what happened to your
[01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:12.520]  son and others well there was 30 brave Americans on there we don't want to
[01:34:12.520 --> 01:34:16.680]  forget the Army National Guards and the three PJs and the 22 steel team
[01:34:16.680 --> 01:34:21.800]  absolutely guys and and bark the dog John John Duke and arrow they called him
[01:34:21.800 --> 01:34:30.640]  gently you know just everything the way Michael was home in June and the way
[01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:36.080]  the other men left you know that there was leaks going on that something was
[01:34:36.080 --> 01:34:44.440]  going on with the top brass and then to find out that in December 2011 I
[01:34:44.440 --> 01:34:51.800]  called Dover and I asked for an autopsy report and with that they sent us a disc
[01:34:51.800 --> 01:34:57.800]  and Michael step mom looked at the disc and she said no don't look at a poor
[01:34:57.800 --> 01:35:03.280]  Christmas I'm like is it that bad and she's like well I mean when she
[01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:09.720]  hesitate I said let me see that and she let me look and Michael was laying like
[01:35:09.720 --> 01:35:15.920]  he uh he had a well he had a gun in his hand and he was intact it was it was like
[01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:23.640]  no air burn like they said the Pentagon folks woman Navy Jane Campbell said that
[01:35:23.640 --> 01:35:29.280]  all bodies were burnt beyond recognition so when this first happened all the six
[01:35:29.280 --> 01:35:33.120]  the people from the Navy they were at the house come saying everybody has to be
[01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:39.040]  cremated everybody has to be cremated and so everybody didn't get cremated
[01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:43.800]  you know but I was told everybody had to be cremated and then when I looked at
[01:35:43.800 --> 01:35:48.160]  the desk I saw my son didn't need to be cremated and I said my son's holding a
[01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:54.320]  gun and then who gave the command after the snooker shot down or whatever
[01:35:54.320 --> 01:36:00.720]  happened not pretty for the Rangers to go in and help them like somebody gave
[01:36:00.720 --> 01:36:08.160]  a stand-down order for them not to wait till they like to go in so I showed
[01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:14.880]  Jason Chavez these chases and I've been to Washington probably about me and my
[01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:20.840]  wife probably about 12 times and they've been really about 30 of the pages the
[01:36:20.840 --> 01:36:26.400]  most highlighted pages and I gave them to these congressmen and congresswomen
[01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:31.400]  and they would look at them and they start reading and they look at me and
[01:36:31.400 --> 01:36:35.640]  they say where'd you get this and I told them how we downloaded the
[01:36:35.640 --> 01:36:39.680]  certificate in the papers and their jaw dropped and they would give me a hug and
[01:36:39.680 --> 01:36:44.880]  I said oh my god I said yeah it was all set up they knew they knew May 10th 9
[01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:50.600]  days it killed them alive that they're gonna shoot down field team six you know
[01:36:50.600 --> 01:36:59.880]  so why would they want to do it I mean you say even data or or a trade with a
[01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:04.800]  Taliban so they wouldn't have reprisals but here's my issue I know your son was
[01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:09.120]  incredibly brave and involved in hundreds and hundreds of amazing missions
[01:37:09.120 --> 01:37:14.120]  from my national security sources and and others that have proven very accurate
[01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:18.400]  they say in that raid that there was basically a body double of bin Laden and
[01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:23.880]  that's why they said they had the barrel on the ship turns out nobody saw that
[01:37:23.880 --> 01:37:27.960]  they've court-martialed over 30 people making them you basically stay quiet
[01:37:27.960 --> 01:37:31.640]  drunk drumming them out of the Navy because they were speaking out there's
[01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:36.280]  been mysterious deaths on the ship I'm sure you know that I don't believe a
[01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:40.880]  word Obama puts out he said they were watching live feeds situation room
[01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:45.680]  photos they released were fake that's all been admitted and from my sources
[01:37:45.680 --> 01:37:50.000]  they were sent in there and they did go in there and get in a firefight and the
[01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:55.400]  helicopter did crash and did you know get blown up so that the the Chinese or
[01:37:55.400 --> 01:38:00.040]  the Russians wouldn't get it the stealth helicopter but that the seals
[01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:05.640]  themselves were asking questions about the raid and that that's why they had
[01:38:05.640 --> 01:38:10.840]  to be gotten rid of I'm sure you've heard that theory I mean we know they set
[01:38:10.840 --> 01:38:14.480]  them up that much has come out we know they lied to you about the cremation
[01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:20.200]  everything lied to you about his body the condition so none of it's true what
[01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:25.720]  why would the bin Laden story be true and again I'm not taken away from wow
[01:38:25.720 --> 01:38:29.880]  something very heroic and I'm killing a son of bin Laden but everything will
[01:38:29.880 --> 01:38:35.520]  bomb it puts out a lie so what's your information on that mr. strange my
[01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:42.480]  information on that mr. Jones is you're talking about now it's a muslim name
[01:38:42.480 --> 01:38:51.200]  my shia out of a shot da jkl he's an evil figure in the
[01:38:51.200 --> 01:38:59.120]  Islamic community there and you know what mr. Jones he is also blind in the
[01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:04.880]  left eye does that sound familiar yes bin Laden's body was dumped into the
[01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:10.240]  water off the northern Arabian Sea after an Islamic ritual that included the
[01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:15.360]  ceremonial washing of his body and wrapping in white sheets they conducted
[01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:23.280]  a 50-minute ceremony I know I'm speechless too mr. Jones I know I know I
[01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:27.400]  don't that's why we need this special investigation we got to bring you know
[01:39:27.400 --> 01:39:34.600]  I was told Joe Biden will get a part in but Leon Panetta Leon the snake Panetta
[01:39:34.600 --> 01:39:39.080]  all sudden he's going but with a special investigation whether you're still in the
[01:39:39.080 --> 01:39:44.080]  military or you're out of the military like the trace trace less 10 days after
[01:39:44.080 --> 01:39:48.880]  my son got killed David I never stepped foot on a battlefield for trace with the
[01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:53.560]  who always had a girlfriend Paul Broadwell he's gonna come in I want to
[01:39:53.560 --> 01:39:57.840]  talk to him because eight months later Benghazi happened he leaves ten days
[01:39:57.840 --> 01:40:02.720]  after my son gets killed they promote him to the CIA and then Benghazi
[01:40:02.720 --> 01:40:07.240]  Admiral Eric Olson two days after my son gets killed he's gone
[01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:12.320]  Admiral McRaven gets promoted general votes out that all this is well in
[01:40:12.320 --> 01:40:20.000]  August 2011 he gets moved general votes out like you know come on man like you
[01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:25.160]  said you don't have to be a rocket scientist here and and then it give me a
[01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:29.520]  bullshit book with no ink if you're so much killed mr. Jones and they gave you
[01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:34.340]  a book with no ink I was with my mom yesterday she said you lucky third lucky
[01:40:34.340 --> 01:40:37.400]  grandpa ain't alive he'd be going right through the front doors of that white
[01:40:37.400 --> 01:40:43.000]  half said to Obama you know we need some answers here somebody has to be held
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:46.320]  accountable I just don't want to hear it was a bad plan lucky shot all that
[01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:52.080]  bullshit I need somebody to go to jail this is murder this is murder mr. Jones
[01:40:52.080 --> 01:40:55.760]  my son knew in June somebody was setting them up but he didn't take
[01:40:55.760 --> 01:41:02.440]  somebody on his own side and when the cars I whoever I don't want to you know
[01:41:02.440 --> 01:41:08.400]  I understand I understand but I mean cars I doesn't have the power to order
[01:41:08.400 --> 01:41:18.240]  special operations to do things does he no yeah we I think we all know who did
[01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:22.640]  the setting up here and he's in Pennsylvania Avenue right now and they
[01:41:22.640 --> 01:41:25.200]  wanted to get rid of the ambassador to because he didn't want to transfer
[01:41:25.200 --> 01:41:30.280]  missiles to al-Qaeda and I tell you then you've got Obama handing not just
[01:41:30.280 --> 01:41:36.160]  Libya but Egypt and now is trying to hand Syria over to al-Qaeda I mean my
[01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:42.280]  goodness it makes you wonder sometimes if the president isn't actually in some
[01:41:42.280 --> 01:41:50.920]  kind of al-Qaeda mole it's uh I don't know I you know I'm not gonna I don't
[01:41:50.920 --> 01:41:56.200]  want to spec speculate on that you know my feelings in my heart but I'm not
[01:41:56.200 --> 01:42:00.040]  going to stay until we get to the courts I understand I understand we just
[01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:03.760]  appreciate your steadfastness sir you know fighting for your son and fighting
[01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:08.200]  for the 30 or 29 other people that died on board the aircraft from the army and
[01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:13.040]  the others now you were saying some things to me off air about specifically
[01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:16.640]  your son being thrown out of the helicopter I know you don't want to
[01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:21.760]  speculate too much but yeah they tell you he's burned beyond recognition then
[01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:25.960]  they give you the disk and he's not burned obviously folks leaking this stuff
[01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:29.720]  to you that care about what's happening the whole military is from from what I've
[01:42:29.720 --> 01:42:33.360]  been told not just the Navy is completely freaked out right now knowing
[01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:38.840]  what really happened what do you think from your sources really went on here
[01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:46.920]  well I believe you know the whole they said this is how general called
[01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:53.400]  explained it in October and he says the snooker was coming in you know I asked a
[01:42:53.400 --> 01:43:01.080]  few questions and he's saying that an RPG hit it six to seven hundred meters away
[01:43:01.080 --> 01:43:07.800]  now six to seven hundred meters away is about nineteen hundred feet the twenty
[01:43:07.800 --> 01:43:14.280]  two hundred feet you know in the pitch stark it was pitch stark and he said it
[01:43:14.280 --> 01:43:22.440]  was it hit the rotary and he had night vision goggles on and it spun it blew up
[01:43:22.440 --> 01:43:27.040]  then it blew up again and then when it hit the ground he said it blew up a
[01:43:27.040 --> 01:43:35.320]  third time so this was an October 2011 brigandier general Jeffery cool who got
[01:43:35.320 --> 01:43:42.880]  promoted to and yeah so this is his thing so I raised my hand I said so
[01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:48.880]  you're telling me that this guy plus I yelled about the lucky shot and would
[01:43:48.880 --> 01:43:52.800]  have been lucky if they missed and I'm out of my mind you know what I mean like
[01:43:52.800 --> 01:43:57.680]  I am still but you know missing my son and I said that's like somebody standing
[01:43:57.680 --> 01:44:02.080]  on top of the entire state building with a quarter and dropping it in a coffee
[01:44:02.080 --> 01:44:07.200]  cup is that weird you're saying this is and he put his head down it's yes yeah
[01:44:07.200 --> 01:44:12.560]  they fired an unguided missile out to about its effective range and just
[01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:19.920]  magically hit I mean Luke Skywalker had not got a shot right right that's why
[01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:28.400]  in our paperwork it mentions manpact it says route one in Kabul about where to
[01:44:28.400 --> 01:44:32.840]  get manpact and they also talk in our paperwork general cope went over with
[01:44:32.840 --> 01:44:38.400]  30 guys for this investigation after that and what I do not know because I'm not
[01:44:38.400 --> 01:44:43.200]  military so many abbreviations but I have some retired Navy SEALs working on
[01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:51.440]  that for me like you know they would say my RC and what I found that means
[01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:57.640]  mission interpreter reporter and different different logos like that but
[01:44:57.640 --> 01:45:03.680]  the main past was also being the tail band are being trained by the Iraq
[01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:09.240]  soldiers on how to use manpact it's in the paperwork anything I tell you right
[01:45:09.240 --> 01:45:15.560]  now mr. Jones is back black and white I sent you over some of the notes that we
[01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:21.480]  copied down and things like that and the other day that Chris your producer
[01:45:21.480 --> 01:45:25.560]  absolutely we'll show some of that on screen we'll get you on to next week on
[01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:28.960]  the nightly news TV show and have all these professionally laid out you've
[01:45:28.960 --> 01:45:33.480]  got a lot of it up on your foundation side I want to give the number out for

[01:45:38.600 --> 01:45:42.080]  want to call in and give their take on the situation in the documented cover
[01:45:42.080 --> 01:45:53.080]  up 800 259 92 31 800 259 92 31 how is the rest of your family handling this
[01:45:53.080 --> 01:45:59.480]  again the number 800 259 92 31 Charles how's the rest of your family handling
[01:45:59.480 --> 01:46:11.960]  this um his brother's brother shaz is very upset you know he thinks about him
[01:46:11.960 --> 01:46:20.200]  every day and he's you know and his sister Caitlyn she was going to move
[01:46:20.200 --> 01:46:26.680]  down to Virginia with him and then three got tighter as the as older they got you
[01:46:26.680 --> 01:46:32.280]  know I mean Michael we all spent time with him when he was with over in Hawaii
[01:46:32.280 --> 01:46:36.480]  he was with Hawaii I think he was helping out seal team two then he was
[01:46:36.480 --> 01:46:39.720]  that's when he was with the dev route he's with them for like a year and a
[01:46:39.720 --> 01:46:45.640]  half I spent 15 days with him in Hawaii and that was pretty neat and some
[01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:52.160]  secrets and squirrel stuff going on over there and then he got you know he was
[01:46:52.160 --> 01:46:57.440]  with your team six the last four years bought a house down in Virginia he was
[01:46:57.440 --> 01:47:04.600]  so proud of his house he he said dad I got a house before you did well I mean
[01:47:04.600 --> 01:47:12.760]  you know he was 21 when he bought a house down there and I said how you beat
[01:47:12.760 --> 01:47:20.200]  me by a year and I went down to some yard work for him and all and I mean all
[01:47:20.200 --> 01:47:25.120]  the young men and women that serve this country God bless them God bless them
[01:47:25.120 --> 01:47:30.520]  you know and Michael really took off in the military with you know we knew
[01:47:30.520 --> 01:47:35.200]  Michael was smart we didn't know who's that smart you know they would give him
[01:47:35.200 --> 01:47:40.800]  newspapers from New York, Texas, Chicago and he would decide for different codes
[01:47:40.800 --> 01:47:46.440]  they were coming in from Paris you know and then with the training they gave
[01:47:46.440 --> 01:47:51.600]  him and they put him with steel team six the latest so it sounds like your son
[01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:57.000]  was actually a savant then if he was able to do that that's like a photographic
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:02.760]  memory simply amazing I want to take a phone call here sir it's just amazing
[01:48:02.760 --> 01:48:10.480]  having you on with us to hear about this 800-25-99-231 Delta Alpha teams
[01:48:10.480 --> 01:48:15.960]  Green Berets Navy SEAL people folks that have worked with them helicopter
[01:48:15.960 --> 01:48:24.200]  pilots night stalkers 800-25-99-231 Jay in Florida ex-Navy worked with the SEALs
[01:48:24.200 --> 01:48:28.040]  what's your question or comment from Mr. Strange the father of the deceased
[01:48:28.040 --> 01:48:34.640]  Navy SEAL hey how you doing Alex and God bless you Mr. Strange I feel for you I
[01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:41.240]  lost a lot of buddies in the Navy myself I was I was a CH-46 crew chief back in
[01:48:41.240 --> 01:48:45.560]  the 80s and I used to drop SEAL teams off and pick them up all across the
[01:48:45.560 --> 01:48:51.360]  world and when I heard they got in a 47 I went what in the world are they
[01:48:51.360 --> 01:48:57.480]  getting on a CH-47 for that's what kind of got me and yeah they wouldn't that's
[01:48:57.480 --> 01:49:01.280]  what the Navy SEAL told me the first one that I talked to the family was they
[01:49:01.280 --> 01:49:05.960]  never got on those plus they wouldn't put that many on one target and they knew
[01:49:05.960 --> 01:49:10.720]  getting on something was going on those are like 40 year old pieces of crud they
[01:49:10.720 --> 01:49:15.880]  were so cheap they wouldn't even put them on a new helicopter they were so
[01:49:15.880 --> 01:49:22.160]  cheap they I'm sorry to cut in but yeah that's another big point absolutely see
[01:49:22.160 --> 01:49:27.880]  the stage 46 has been phased out of the Navy and now they have H-60s and they
[01:49:27.880 --> 01:49:31.960]  can't take as many people aboard the H-60s but they're a lot newer aircraft
[01:49:31.960 --> 01:49:37.120]  and that's what that's when I heard that I just went what in the world you know
[01:49:37.120 --> 01:49:41.480]  of course if there was big bad things going on then they try to get them out
[01:49:41.480 --> 01:49:45.400]  of there but then when I heard that they were going into another mission that
[01:49:45.400 --> 01:49:49.480]  that wouldn't have happened when I was in the Navy matter of fact when I was in
[01:49:49.480 --> 01:49:56.080]  Hawaii just on one of my cruises aboard you know ships we were at
[01:49:56.080 --> 01:50:01.240]  Harbour's Point I believe the Naval Air Station and all the CH-47s were down
[01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:04.920]  across the world because one of them went down in Germany and killed
[01:50:04.920 --> 01:50:08.120]  everybody that's what I was told I was told they didn't get on those and they
[01:50:08.120 --> 01:50:11.360]  then that's what that was the first big they were already freaked out like is
[01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:17.800]  this it is that what you've been told Charles basically as well from my Navy
[01:50:17.800 --> 01:50:25.440]  Shields Michael's team did I believe you they never did 22 guys four guys eight
[01:50:25.440 --> 01:50:36.640]  guys six guys and they never ever ever went into a battle zone in a CH-47 day
[01:50:36.640 --> 01:50:43.000]  and I'd like to say one more thing the next day when they went in for to get
[01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:49.240]  Michael and them they had 30 plans and they have black hawks and can finders
[01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:54.040]  and a hundred forty guys. Stay there sirs explain what that means when

[01:54:24.480 --> 01:54:28.800]  studio this flew down from Dallas what a what what a heavy subject we're talking
[01:54:28.800 --> 01:54:33.840]  about here when as a father I can't even imagine just imagining it tears my guts
[01:54:33.840 --> 01:54:38.400]  out Charles strange joins us to father of Michael strange you were making a
[01:54:38.400 --> 01:54:43.360]  point about how they had all the nice equipment sitting right there but they
[01:54:43.360 --> 01:54:48.160]  sent them off all packed in there that they'd never done before in a clunker
[01:54:48.160 --> 01:54:51.600]  that had been you know basically for almost everybody decommissioned except
[01:54:51.600 --> 01:54:55.200]  for hauling ammunition I mean is that the point you're getting out here with the
[01:54:55.200 --> 01:55:03.280]  last comment you made sir yes they for the rescue team they had first of all
[01:55:03.280 --> 01:55:08.280]  they didn't know what helicopter got shot down for ten minutes they didn't
[01:55:08.280 --> 01:55:13.920]  know paper work general cold ass the guy that we know there's four sensors four
[01:55:13.920 --> 01:55:19.720]  eyes in the sky and he says well sir actually we didn't know what helicopter
[01:55:19.720 --> 01:55:24.760]  got shot down for ten minutes and then he goes well how about the rescue mission
[01:55:24.760 --> 01:55:30.160]  somebody gave a stand-down command they didn't go right in they waited for the
[01:55:30.160 --> 01:55:34.960]  sunlight to come up he goes we have 30 plans for the rescue mission we have a
[01:55:34.960 --> 01:55:41.320]  hundred forty men we have black Hawks we have cast finders today for today no
[01:55:41.320 --> 01:55:48.000]  somebody knew mr. Jones somebody set this up why I mean you could go what did
[01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:52.800]  Michael and them guys know they knew something because in June the way Michael
[01:55:52.800 --> 01:55:58.920]  left you know talking about a will and and somebody other men you know so who
[01:55:58.920 --> 01:56:04.440]  was it it goes to the top with the special investigation and and for all
[01:56:04.440 --> 01:56:08.880]  your listeners out there call your congressman it's not a Republican
[01:56:08.880 --> 01:56:12.640]  Democrat things about American lives I don't want this to happen anybody else's
[01:56:12.640 --> 01:56:17.760]  son or daughter to turn this country absolutely somebody has to be exposed
[01:56:17.760 --> 01:56:22.360]  absolutely or Obama will tell more lies than get rid of any witnesses he needs to
[01:56:22.360 --> 01:56:28.760]  let's talk to to John his former army what's your take on what you're hearing
[01:56:28.760 --> 01:56:33.400]  or what's the point you'd like to add or questions yes sir I have a question
[01:56:33.400 --> 01:56:39.040]  about the official report that was in the media they said that the helicopter
[01:56:39.040 --> 01:56:43.120]  that went down was a CH-47 Chinook I've been on those many times and many
[01:56:43.120 --> 01:56:49.200]  missions and they're actually great helicopters but my take on it is that
[01:56:49.200 --> 01:56:54.800]  the official report said that it was a National Guard helicopter now as soon as
[01:56:54.800 --> 01:56:59.680]  they said that me and my team and my buddies raise eyebrows because that was
[01:56:59.680 --> 01:57:04.560]  a red flag right there because no special forces unit whether it be army
[01:57:04.560 --> 01:57:09.080]  Navy Marine Corps will ever fly a National Guard bird they always fly a
[01:57:09.080 --> 01:57:14.840]  special unit you know regiment like 160 a SOAR special operations aviation
[01:57:14.840 --> 01:57:20.480]  regiment so that was a red flag right there and another one I know notice
[01:57:20.480 --> 01:57:25.040]  another car brought up was that you'll never put all your birds in one basket
[01:57:25.040 --> 01:57:29.720]  you'll separate a team so there's a couple of points right there I want to
[01:57:29.720 --> 01:57:34.640]  ask maybe someone else could if they know the answer you talk about but that
[01:57:34.640 --> 01:57:37.840]  those are the two big red flags that I know what is your gut what does your gut
[01:57:37.840 --> 01:57:43.640]  tell you here I mean it's clear there's a cover up it's clear they unfortunately
[01:57:43.640 --> 01:57:51.360]  have to agree I believe I believe that you know basically what you believe you
[01:57:51.360 --> 01:57:58.720]  know same thing false flags homegrown terrorism CIA it's all unfortunately done
[01:57:58.720 --> 01:58:05.000]  you know by our own government and shadows of it or I guess you know you
[01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:09.200]  can go in depth on that but criminal elements criminal elements you know it's
[01:58:09.200 --> 01:58:15.400]  all been taken over and and I just hope that we weed them out you know I hope
[01:58:15.400 --> 01:58:20.000]  that yeah before they weed us out they're trying to weed us out right now
[01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:25.720]  exactly God bless you sir yeah they're going after the good people folks this
[01:58:25.720 --> 01:58:29.480]  is a criminal takeover and folks better decide what side they're on this isn't
[01:58:29.480 --> 01:58:33.680]  a game this isn't a joke five more minutes with our guests take a final
[01:58:33.680 --> 01:58:37.880]  call or so and get some final comments that mr. Strange will join us next week

[02:00:57.800 --> 02:01:07.040]  um well you know this is these guys were very very intelligent men all 30 was
[02:01:07.040 --> 02:01:14.480]  brave Americans and they knew something okay and they trusted they knew going
[02:01:14.480 --> 02:01:19.800]  over to Afghanistan but there's a possibility hey we're at war but they
[02:01:19.800 --> 02:01:24.600]  never thought it would come from the people they trusted the most my god
[02:01:24.600 --> 02:01:32.680]  no one's by mine Alex how these sick twisted evil SOB's can lay their head
[02:01:32.680 --> 02:01:37.640]  down at night time and sleep like they're just evil people that have done
[02:01:37.640 --> 02:01:45.160]  this I'm watching my husband go through this for the past two years has been so
[02:01:45.160 --> 02:01:52.520]  unbelievably painful you know and he's my husband's a great guy he's a
[02:01:52.520 --> 02:01:58.880]  wonderful man you know and and it's just it's sickening it's sickening I can't
[02:01:58.880 --> 02:02:04.240]  believe these guys were murdered by our own but so many people walk around you
[02:02:04.240 --> 02:02:08.000]  know with the blinders on and don't want to believe that you know our
[02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:14.680]  government could do that we're not in 1930s or 40s anymore people you know we
[02:02:14.680 --> 02:02:19.880]  have somebody in the White House that hates America that's right in the past
[02:02:19.880 --> 02:02:23.800]  I've studied history even corrupt individuals in the past knew to not do
[02:02:23.800 --> 02:02:28.240]  really bad stuff like this because it's it's so dishonorable it is such bad
[02:02:28.240 --> 02:02:32.880]  luck even for the elites that do it they are out of their minds and I hope Mary

[02:02:55.720 --> 02:03:02.120]  that he's very proud of his dad and and I believe that if Michael was here and
[02:03:02.120 --> 02:03:07.880]  the roles were reversed he wouldn't stop until he found out the truth and you
[02:03:07.880 --> 02:03:13.800]  know why we're going to find out like whatever the truth is Alex we can
[02:03:13.800 --> 02:03:18.800]  handle it we can just tell us the truth what happened absolutely I'm on a jam
[02:03:18.800 --> 02:03:23.720]  in these calls quick real fast Michael in Wisconsin Army Afghanistan just real
[02:03:23.720 --> 02:03:30.160]  quick question I just would like to say about I was an honor and first airborne
[02:03:30.160 --> 02:03:36.680]  the first that we got into country back in or one or two and all the different
[02:03:36.680 --> 02:03:42.680]  operation units there unfortunately they just didn't throw you on to a CH 47
[02:03:42.680 --> 02:03:49.360]  Chinook you know that it's just because of lack of assets well I don't think that
[02:03:49.360 --> 02:03:51.840]  would generally be with the Navy SEALs from what I was told but I could see
[02:03:51.840 --> 02:03:54.240]  what you're saying and you heard the earlier guy say that was actually I
[02:03:54.240 --> 02:03:57.280]  know there were overall in the past reliable aircraft the point is they
[02:03:57.280 --> 02:04:00.880]  never put them on together like that from what I was told and I guess you were
[02:04:00.880 --> 02:04:05.200]  in the Army maybe it was different there well you go in there's all the
[02:04:05.200 --> 02:04:09.240]  different coalitions special ops will say I'm sitting there on a QRF quick

[02:08:23.520 --> 02:08:27.720]  resistance it's Alex Jones
[02:08:31.320 --> 02:08:36.160]  well I tell you folks anybody who's a football fan those who drew Pearson is
[02:08:36.160 --> 02:08:40.680]  with all the famous Hail Marys and all the big you know Super Bowls and playoffs
[02:08:40.680 --> 02:08:44.360]  and all of it I grew up in Dallas born in Dallas so some of my earliest memories
[02:08:44.360 --> 02:08:49.360]  were Sunday parties with all the friends and family over and watching
[02:08:49.360 --> 02:08:54.240]  Roger Stallbach and Drew Pearson so I tell you and my dad's in get out from
[02:08:54.240 --> 02:09:00.840]  in front of the television absolutely amazing and so he's with us for the
[02:09:00.840 --> 02:09:03.600]  balance of the hour and I'm kind of glad we just went from that super heavy
[02:09:03.600 --> 02:09:07.920]  issue of the Navy Seals being killed in their helicopter being taken out into
[02:09:07.920 --> 02:09:12.720]  something a little more happy here but you know we had Mary Lou Hiner on a few
[02:09:12.720 --> 02:09:15.560]  weeks ago of taxi and all those big movies because she's involved with
[02:09:15.560 --> 02:09:19.680]  young Jevity and then I was looking Drew Pearsons involved not just all these
[02:09:19.680 --> 02:09:23.320]  NBA and you know famous NFL people because of how really good these products
[02:09:23.320 --> 02:09:26.600]  are this isn't an infomercial today but we'll we'll talk some about it this is
[02:09:26.600 --> 02:09:30.120]  such great products and also funds the broadcast and the news organization but
[02:09:30.120 --> 02:09:34.160]  I thought wow let me get him on the phone or let me get Drew Pearson on via
[02:09:34.160 --> 02:09:38.120]  Skype and Drew Pearson said no I'll come down there when I get a chance in a few
[02:09:38.120 --> 02:09:42.200]  months and I'm like really so he flew down here from Big D and it is awesome
[02:09:42.200 --> 02:09:45.920]  and and man I tell you you look like you're 20 years old in shape don't beat
[02:09:45.920 --> 02:09:49.400]  me up thank you if I know you can get a compliment like that I would have been
[02:09:49.400 --> 02:09:53.000]  here a long time ago and I think that's a sharp looking suit too man thank you
[02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:57.960]  no but I mean I talked to so many NFL guys especially people that have taken
[02:09:57.960 --> 02:10:01.800]  all the knocks you have they can hardly walk man in person you look like you're
[02:10:01.800 --> 02:10:06.320]  ready to you know to take on the special forces I mean how have you done it and
[02:10:06.320 --> 02:10:11.440]  and you're doing Fox TV shows ESPN you're doing public speaking worldwide
[02:10:11.440 --> 02:10:15.240]  I mean it's amazing you're doing all these charities for people I mean you're
[02:10:15.240 --> 02:10:19.600]  you're a busy guy yeah I am and I'm blessed because you know as coach
[02:10:19.600 --> 02:10:23.520]  Landry used to say if we're fortunate there's gonna be a lot of life after
[02:10:23.520 --> 02:10:28.800]  football and so he tried to get us to prepare for life after football I play
[02:10:28.800 --> 02:10:33.320]  11 years for the Cowboys and the first couple years I've learned all I can learn
[02:10:33.320 --> 02:10:37.880]  about the X's in those the strategies of the game you just keep implementing that
[02:10:37.880 --> 02:10:42.160]  and getting better at that but then what do you do with the rest of your time you
[02:10:42.160 --> 02:10:46.400]  know what I did was watch and observe how that Cowboy organization did business
[02:10:46.400 --> 02:10:51.120]  how Landry carried himself how he was the CEO of the team and Tex Tram and
[02:10:51.120 --> 02:10:56.840]  Gil Bratt even though all these guys had totally different personalities they
[02:10:56.840 --> 02:11:01.440]  all came together for the good of the Dallas Cowboys and so I took that
[02:11:01.440 --> 02:11:06.400]  information that knowledge and parlayed it into a life after football but at the
[02:11:06.400 --> 02:11:11.880]  same time we knew we weren't going to make enough money to last for a life
[02:11:11.880 --> 02:11:16.160]  after football so while we're playing for the Dallas Cowboys we're developing
[02:11:16.160 --> 02:11:20.880]  contacts I worked every all season that I played for the Dallas Cowboys I worked
[02:11:20.880 --> 02:11:25.280]  for an attorney I sold shoes I worked sporting goods I was in oil and gas
[02:11:25.280 --> 02:11:30.200]  business just trying to get ready for life after football so all that
[02:11:30.200 --> 02:11:35.440]  preparation got me ready for life after football and because of that and then
[02:11:35.440 --> 02:11:40.400]  the association with the Dallas Cowboys having success winning you know the
[02:11:40.400 --> 02:11:44.520]  11 years that I played we played and I played in seven championship games one
[02:11:44.520 --> 02:11:48.920]  game away from seven Super Bowls in 11 years we didn't win it every time but
[02:11:48.920 --> 02:11:53.480]  because of that consistent level of winning people recognize and know the
[02:11:53.480 --> 02:11:58.200]  name Drew Pearson my tenure with the Cowboys is when we became known as
[02:11:58.200 --> 02:12:03.600]  America's team so we're always on TV so all and also know for being clean too
[02:12:03.600 --> 02:12:09.000]  and good yeah Tom Landry your your head coached that image you know him on the
[02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:12.160]  sideline with the suit and tie that's why I'm wearing a tie right now by the
[02:12:12.160 --> 02:12:15.640]  way I should be doing that he's influence my grandfather you know I was in
[02:12:15.640 --> 02:12:18.680]  track and field like football the University of Texas and for three years
[02:12:18.680 --> 02:12:22.640]  he was roommates with Tom Landry yeah and I remember you know he's gone now
[02:12:22.640 --> 02:12:26.360]  but ask him he said no that was Tom Landry yes he said the nicest like
[02:12:26.360 --> 02:12:31.120]  beyond John Wayne he was the real deal and would do anything for you oh yeah
[02:12:31.120 --> 02:12:35.000]  without a doubt and the thing about it is you know he made you good football
[02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:39.160]  players but he's trying to make men of you as well when we travel the games we
[02:12:39.160 --> 02:12:42.800]  were suit and ties we didn't carry gym bags we carry briefcases we were
[02:12:42.800 --> 02:12:46.640]  studying computer printouts the tendencies of our opponents way back in
[02:12:46.640 --> 02:12:50.880]  the early 70s so he was preparing us for life after football and then you add
[02:12:50.880 --> 02:12:56.520]  all that to the success of winning consistently so now in your life after
[02:12:56.520 --> 02:13:01.080]  football people know you they recognize you when you throw your name out there
[02:13:01.080 --> 02:13:04.240]  to try to get in the door for a business meeting or an opportunity or
[02:13:04.240 --> 02:13:08.520]  something man people recognize that name right away and right away you'll get
[02:13:08.520 --> 02:13:12.240]  that opportunity to meet or at least present whatever product you're trying
[02:13:12.240 --> 02:13:17.520]  to sell so I've been able to parlay that into a life after football and created
[02:13:17.520 --> 02:13:23.120]  great opportunities for me whether it be in broadcasting or business and just
[02:13:23.120 --> 02:13:26.640]  feel very fortunate and you know when you're hanging around guys like Roger
[02:13:26.640 --> 02:13:33.040]  Stalbach Bob Lilly Leroy Jordan Mel Renfrow Bob Hayes and guys like that you
[02:13:33.040 --> 02:13:37.680]  know sooner or later you know people are going to look at you as they look at
[02:13:37.680 --> 02:13:42.560]  them and if you're smart you'll live your life like they kind of live their
[02:13:42.560 --> 02:13:48.760]  lives as well we've got some of your famous plays up there on the screen
[02:13:48.760 --> 02:13:53.080]  right now and I tell you it's flashbacks to childhood yeah flashbacks to
[02:13:53.080 --> 02:13:57.320]  childhood big time sitting there looking at that I drew Pearson's here if you
[02:13:57.320 --> 02:14:01.480]  just joined us and that's the reason I wanted to get you on because I went and
[02:14:01.480 --> 02:14:04.680]  you know of course I've seen you off and on on national television and followed
[02:14:04.680 --> 02:14:08.800]  your career after football but going to doing research for the interview I'm
[02:14:08.800 --> 02:14:12.000]  like my gosh there's too much to cover there there's nothing this guy had
[02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.920]  been involved in and and that's so exciting you know I don't want to
[02:14:14.920 --> 02:14:17.840]  stereotype young people today because every old generation does that to the
[02:14:17.840 --> 02:14:22.480]  next but I know what my grandfather was like with my dad was like and I don't
[02:14:22.480 --> 02:14:26.520]  even and I'm a workaholic I don't work like my dad has done just because they
[02:14:26.520 --> 02:14:29.280]  enjoy it they get into it they don't want to sit around unless it's Sunday
[02:14:29.280 --> 02:14:33.760]  watching football or something or camping and now I look at young people and
[02:14:33.760 --> 02:14:36.120]  stuff and people out of college and we have to go through a lot of them we
[02:14:36.120 --> 02:14:39.760]  find good people we've now got a great crew they literally think the whole
[02:14:39.760 --> 02:14:43.200]  world's just gonna be handed to them and they don't want that job that entry
[02:14:43.200 --> 02:14:47.000]  level job they immediately just want to have it all handed to them and then I
[02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.960]  guess that's why we got a hundred and one million Americans now on food
[02:14:49.960 --> 02:14:53.240]  assistance of one type or another I don't want to be negative here I think we
[02:14:53.240 --> 02:14:57.200]  should talk about Drew Pearson as the positive versus the negative what would
[02:14:57.200 --> 02:15:00.880]  you say to young people out there that that you know that feel like entry level
[02:15:00.880 --> 02:15:04.960]  stuff isn't good enough for them well I would say you got to start somewhere you
[02:15:04.960 --> 02:15:08.840]  know no one ever unless you it's not sometimes you heard it's not what you
[02:15:08.840 --> 02:15:12.480]  know it's who you know and if you know somebody maybe you can start at the top
[02:15:12.480 --> 02:15:16.520]  but still that doesn't make you qualify to do the job usually short-lived
[02:15:16.520 --> 02:15:21.920]  right so I you know entry level hey you got to start somewhere I joined the
[02:15:21.920 --> 02:15:26.320]  Dallas Cowboys undrafted free agent there was 100 other rookies there you
[02:15:26.320 --> 02:15:30.200]  know don't look at Drew that's why I raised that yeah don't look at Drew
[02:15:30.200 --> 02:15:35.120]  Pearson now is there one of the all-time great Cowboys ring of honor guy and that
[02:15:35.120 --> 02:15:40.120]  type of thing look at the distance I traveled to get to that honor you know
[02:15:40.120 --> 02:15:45.080]  as I said undrafted free agent a hundred hundred rookies 165 pounds as a
[02:15:45.080 --> 02:15:50.200]  rookie running 4640 never lifted any weights in high school or college didn't
[02:15:50.200 --> 02:15:55.360]  lift any ways till I got to the pros and and made the and made the Cowboys so
[02:15:55.360 --> 02:15:59.760]  that's what people love I got to get in the door if you get in your door then
[02:15:59.760 --> 02:16:03.720]  you can create opportunities for yourself so how do you get in a door entry
[02:16:03.720 --> 02:16:08.000]  level is the way to get in the door and then when I got into business I'm selling
[02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:12.800]  hats for Drew Pearson marketing that's what I did I started that in 85 two years
[02:16:12.800 --> 02:16:17.080]  after I retired from the NFL yeah sharp hats yeah thank you and you know we
[02:16:17.080 --> 02:16:21.560]  created a business niche for ourselves by just getting in a door when you get in
[02:16:21.560 --> 02:16:25.400]  the door you don't go ask for all the business stop doing business with
[02:16:25.400 --> 02:16:28.960]  everybody else you've been doing business with for all these years no just
[02:16:28.960 --> 02:16:33.240]  give us a little niche of business that they might not be capable of doing
[02:16:33.240 --> 02:16:38.480]  they're not by might not be servicing the way it should be service so we got
[02:16:38.480 --> 02:16:42.800]  in the door with people like the NFL and behave major league baseball and that
[02:16:42.800 --> 02:16:46.560]  created opportunities for us to get in the door and a retail side with with
[02:16:46.560 --> 02:16:50.960]  retailers like Walmart Kmart and people like that but it's all about getting in
[02:16:50.960 --> 02:16:54.600]  the door and then increasing your footprint once you get in the door
[02:16:54.600 --> 02:16:59.040]  everybody wants to start at the top but it doesn't work that way sometimes well
[02:16:59.040 --> 02:17:01.400]  plus if you started at the top you wouldn't want to run everything you've
[02:17:01.400 --> 02:17:05.840]  got to start low level to learn all the skills even some of my worst jobs I had
[02:17:05.840 --> 02:17:09.440]  in high school and college I look back now and learned a little pieces of things
[02:17:09.440 --> 02:17:14.080]  yes that now I can bring together in other areas right well that's and that's
[02:17:14.080 --> 02:17:17.480]  important and part of those pieces of things that you got to learn is from
[02:17:17.480 --> 02:17:21.800]  the people you're you surround yourself with you know a blessing for me when I
[02:17:21.800 --> 02:17:25.160]  play football was the people I was playing with Landry Stahlberg all those
[02:17:25.160 --> 02:17:28.800]  other great players and made me better then when I got in the business I took
[02:17:28.800 --> 02:17:33.000]  that lesson you know and say you surround yourself if you want to be
[02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:36.840]  successful surround yourself with success and when I got in the business I
[02:17:36.840 --> 02:17:41.320]  surrounded myself with people that were smarter than me on the business side
[02:17:41.320 --> 02:17:45.200]  because while I'm playing football for 11 years trying to develop that career I
[02:17:45.200 --> 02:17:48.840]  knew they were out there developing their business careers and those are the
[02:17:48.840 --> 02:17:52.640]  kind of people I surrounded myself with to start my business through Pearson
[02:17:52.640 --> 02:17:57.360]  marketing and that's why we were able to be successful for 23 years amazing I
[02:17:57.360 --> 02:18:01.440]  want to get into just a whole corner copy of issues we come back from break
[02:18:01.440 --> 02:18:06.960]  but first off our connection is through young Jebedy I I don't claim I'm some
[02:18:06.960 --> 02:18:10.920]  super you know you know athlete guy and you know exercise enough that I have
[02:18:10.920 --> 02:18:14.440]  over the years but I'm telling you I saw friends and family with this have
[02:18:14.440 --> 02:18:18.760]  dramatic results people with joint problems people with weight problems
[02:18:18.760 --> 02:18:22.920]  people with their hair falling out whatever it's just so good for them
[02:18:22.920 --> 02:18:27.920]  that I finally got into I've never you know promoted vitamins and minerals and
[02:18:27.920 --> 02:18:31.280]  things like this but then I got to know Dr. Wallach and everybody and I know you
[02:18:31.280 --> 02:18:34.440]  only endorse stuff that's part of it being a salesman is you find the great
[02:18:34.440 --> 02:18:37.480]  products it sells itself what can you say in a minute and a half as we go to
[02:18:37.480 --> 02:18:41.000]  break about young Jebedy and about the particular products that you're
[02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:44.440]  promoting for them well then Jebedy first of all is a great company you know
[02:18:44.440 --> 02:18:47.440]  it's great to be associated and the reason I'm associated with is because my
[02:18:47.440 --> 02:18:51.800]  former business partner in the headwear industry is the now the CFO of young
[02:18:51.800 --> 02:18:56.000]  Jebedy and he introduced me to the company then he introduced me to some
[02:18:56.000 --> 02:19:00.480]  products that he thought could help me he saw me dragging my right leg around
[02:19:00.480 --> 02:19:04.440]  from knee surgery I had for my playing days and now it's taking a negative
[02:19:04.440 --> 02:19:10.440]  effect on the rest of my body and it's causing me not to have the wellness and
[02:19:10.440 --> 02:19:15.680]  the good health that I need and I don't like dragging my leg around I got a
[02:19:15.680 --> 02:19:19.320]  little pride I don't want to walk around hurt so he introduced me to this cream
[02:19:19.320 --> 02:19:25.200]  CM cream and I tried it and I couldn't believe the immediate results and it's
[02:19:25.200 --> 02:19:31.160]  it took away the pain first of all then it increased my flexibility second of all
[02:19:31.160 --> 02:19:36.920]  and it reduced the swelling third of all and now I'm almost pain-free with the
[02:19:36.920 --> 02:19:40.240]  knee now it doesn't it doesn't heal it but it makes him a little more
[02:19:40.240 --> 02:19:44.360]  comfortable to deal with it now you got to do other things to try to fix it
[02:19:44.360 --> 02:19:46.440]  let's talk about that when we come back because it makes you a lot more
[02:19:46.440 --> 02:19:49.440]  comfortable absolutely Ted Anderson was gonna have knee surgery the owner of

[02:19:54.960 --> 02:19:57.800]  the different products and didn't have to have the surgery that's what we're

[02:25:04.520 --> 02:25:08.440]  really do anything beyond Tangierine is a meal replacement they don't even
[02:25:08.440 --> 02:25:11.060]  advertise it as that but I was telling you during the break that's what I've
[02:25:11.060 --> 02:25:16.400]  lost 30 pounds with it and any other 30 to go but specifically because Ted
[02:25:16.400 --> 02:25:19.960]  Anderson talked about the CM tablets and the cream he was going to have to have
[02:25:19.960 --> 02:25:24.800]  the surgery and the pain just went away obviously you tackled so many times well
[02:25:24.800 --> 02:25:28.640]  not too many usually got away from them what did it do for you because this isn't
[02:25:28.640 --> 02:25:32.720]  a game I only promote folks what I believe works right and what has had a
[02:25:32.720 --> 02:25:36.880]  great effect I promote things I believe in you were telling me during the break
[02:25:36.880 --> 02:25:41.160]  same thing with you yeah what it what it did for me is gave me some relief you
[02:25:41.160 --> 02:25:45.520]  know I said I had that knee surgery on my right knee back in 1980 and then with
[02:25:45.520 --> 02:25:50.200]  the wear and care running past routes and playing 11 years in the NFL you know
[02:25:50.200 --> 02:25:53.600]  sooner or later in your life after football that's going to come back and
[02:25:53.600 --> 02:25:57.680]  affect you and it's going to bother you and it was bothering me and you know
[02:25:57.680 --> 02:26:02.520]  being an active guy it kind of slowed me down and set me down and I was trying
[02:26:02.520 --> 02:26:06.760]  all different kind of things and all of a sudden Dave briskey who's a CFO with
[02:26:06.760 --> 02:26:11.360]  young Jevity a former business partner comes to me and introduces me to the to
[02:26:11.360 --> 02:26:16.560]  the CM cream says just try it because he saw me dragging my leg around and so I
[02:26:16.560 --> 02:26:21.520]  did try it and first thing I noticed it wasn't smelly like most analgesics are
[02:26:21.520 --> 02:26:28.280]  bombs are it wasn't oily or any greasy or anything like that and then after I put
[02:26:28.280 --> 02:26:34.960]  it on it just fell a coolness effect and what that was was a penetration of the
[02:26:34.960 --> 02:26:40.280]  ingredients here in the CM cream automatically instantly hitting my knee
[02:26:40.280 --> 02:26:44.240]  where it needs to be hit and right away I could feel the difference the
[02:26:44.240 --> 02:26:48.800]  flexibility increase well first of all the swelling decrease which increased
[02:26:48.800 --> 02:26:53.560]  the flexibility and because of that flexibility increase the pain started
[02:26:53.560 --> 02:26:58.920]  to subside as well so now I use it on a regular basis and if you take the CM plus
[02:26:58.920 --> 02:27:03.260]  pill now that's going to heal you from the inside out so you have the cream
[02:27:03.260 --> 02:27:07.880]  working from the outside in and the pill working from the inside out now if I
[02:27:07.880 --> 02:27:12.120]  had this stuff back in the day Alex Jones I'd still be playing for the Dallas
[02:27:12.120 --> 02:27:15.960]  Cowboys probably well exactly that's what things that's what the erect live
[02:27:15.960 --> 02:27:21.000]  said yeah and so many other you know top NBA people right he's no rebound no one
[02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:25.000]  explains that the food has had the minerals dissipated out of it because
[02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:28.760]  they use these chemical fertilizers right and the body needs 90 things not
[02:27:28.760 --> 02:27:33.320]  three like a plant yeah it's just it's so elementary but the hospitals none of
[02:27:33.320 --> 02:27:37.280]  them will teach nutrition right and I you know I don't really care what's in it
[02:27:37.280 --> 02:27:41.560]  you know I'll leave that to Dr. Wallach and the experts over there at Young
[02:27:41.560 --> 02:27:46.240]  Jevity all I know is it works and that's all I care well we've got listeners
[02:27:46.240 --> 02:27:50.160]  to get results exactly we've got listeners for 18 years that know until
[02:27:50.160 --> 02:27:53.000]  three years ago they never heard me promote vitamins minerals and stuff
[02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:57.200]  because I try stuff and I'm like well I don't feel anything here I can't take
[02:27:57.200 --> 02:28:01.120]  me on Tangierine in the evening because it'll keep me up there's no caffeine in
[02:28:01.120 --> 02:28:05.960]  it no but there's B12 and that kind of exactly give you the energy and keep
[02:28:05.960 --> 02:28:11.360]  exactly yeah and this is good the beyond Tangierine because everybody we
[02:28:11.360 --> 02:28:15.680]  know we need to take vitamins and nobody wants to be taking pills 30 40 pills so
[02:28:15.680 --> 02:28:19.160]  it's all right here at a tab you open it up put in the bottle of water some juice
[02:28:19.160 --> 02:28:22.960]  you drink that down you got the what does it do for you you like it yeah it
[02:28:22.960 --> 02:28:27.960]  gives me the energy it keeps me up with my vitamin mineral intake that I need to
[02:28:27.960 --> 02:28:33.160]  take because like I was saying you know nobody drew how old are you do I have to
[02:28:33.160 --> 02:28:38.280]  give that you know you just look really really I'm 62 I'll be 63 I need to look
[02:28:38.280 --> 02:28:45.200]  like him right now and an NFL pension so I really feel old but now I've been
[02:28:45.200 --> 02:28:48.880]  blessed in my life after football a lot of it is because I take care of my body
[02:28:48.880 --> 02:28:53.340]  and a lot of the reasons is with the CM cream and tablet and beyond tangy

[02:34:08.600 --> 02:34:12.680]  the sunday show four to six p.m. as well we've had a bunch of special reports this
[02:34:12.680 --> 02:34:16.480]  week from the nightly news that we haven't gotten to on the radio will be
[02:34:16.480 --> 02:34:20.240]  airing some of those incredibly important reports on the sunday broadcast as
[02:34:20.240 --> 02:34:24.600]  well four to six p.m. the news websites are in full wars dot com and prison
[02:34:24.600 --> 02:34:28.280]  planet dot com and we have a big story Kurt Nemo wrote up on drudge report dot
[02:34:28.280 --> 02:34:33.400]  com drudges on there like every I mean the last two days in a row and Nemo's
[02:34:33.400 --> 02:34:36.920]  had stories on the drudge report so good job to Kurt Nemo over there
[02:34:36.920 --> 02:34:43.280]  covering Diane Feinstein saying you aren't press unless you're getting an
[02:34:43.280 --> 02:34:48.760]  official salary from an official news agency and people better watch out about
[02:34:48.760 --> 02:34:53.360]  that because they want to start restricting people's access as the
[02:34:53.360 --> 02:34:58.000]  press to cover things and press freedom like not giving up sources they want to
[02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:01.160]  be able to say that you don't have those rights but she's also saying talk radio
[02:35:01.160 --> 02:35:04.920]  isn't shouldn't have press freedom and that they should have the fairness
[02:35:04.920 --> 02:35:09.440]  doctrine again it's totally unfair and controls what we can say did you know
[02:35:09.440 --> 02:35:13.720]  before the mid 1980s folks you couldn't get political and say what your view is
[02:35:13.720 --> 02:35:17.160]  Drew Pearson let me put you on the hot seat here because I was I was joking
[02:35:17.160 --> 02:35:19.840]  about hey look you have all these big shows but you love to promote your own
[02:35:19.840 --> 02:35:24.520]  but I'm the same way I mean it's like when I do some YouTube at home and it's
[02:35:24.520 --> 02:35:28.440]  just me I almost like it more than when I'm on the official show because it's
[02:35:28.440 --> 02:35:34.600]  it's like a hobby or something it makes it more fun but talking about politics in
[02:35:34.600 --> 02:35:38.160]  this world I know you're nothing but a positive guy but what is there that you
[02:35:38.160 --> 02:35:42.160]  think's positive about what's happening in America versus what's negative about
[02:35:42.160 --> 02:35:45.920]  what's happening in America and then related to the Cowboys what's positive
[02:35:45.920 --> 02:35:50.400]  about the Cowboys development right now or other football teams versus versus
[02:35:50.400 --> 02:35:56.120]  negative and is and is the NFL gonna get less gangster now or more gangster I
[02:35:56.120 --> 02:36:00.480]  think it's gonna get less gangster to take that on first but because NFL
[02:36:00.480 --> 02:36:07.360]  Paris had be have always been trying to police the NFL as far as the players are
[02:36:07.360 --> 02:36:11.720]  concerned now the players haven't lately been following that policy because you
[02:36:11.720 --> 02:36:17.000]  see more arrests from NFL football players but that doesn't mean the NFL is
[02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:21.920]  not gonna stop or is gonna stop beating on these players to try to get them to
[02:36:21.920 --> 02:36:25.800]  do the right thing but a lot of times these players get in this position where
[02:36:25.800 --> 02:36:29.600]  they're gonna make this type of money and they feel this certain level of power
[02:36:29.600 --> 02:36:34.200]  now that they have because they are in NFL and they're playing under the shield
[02:36:34.200 --> 02:36:38.760]  of the NFL they think they're invincible and they can go out and do things that
[02:36:38.760 --> 02:36:43.080]  they normally wouldn't do and but they quickly learned that you know once you
[02:36:43.080 --> 02:36:47.680]  cross that line and commit a crime or something of that nature you just like
[02:36:47.680 --> 02:36:51.440]  anybody else and you're gonna be prosecuted just like anybody else but I
[02:36:51.440 --> 02:36:56.360]  think what's positive in this country I think our our leadership is positive I
[02:36:56.360 --> 02:37:01.520]  think you know despite you know still having a lot of issues unemployment
[02:37:01.520 --> 02:37:06.360]  educational dealing with the war and all that kind of stuff that we deal with I
[02:37:06.360 --> 02:37:10.760]  think the leadership the right leadership is in place for us to deal with
[02:37:10.760 --> 02:37:17.120]  that and I think what's so I think that's good what's wrong is the some of
[02:37:17.120 --> 02:37:21.280]  the things I mentioned you know the unemployment the the poverty and things
[02:37:21.280 --> 02:37:25.040]  like that you know you you go in Dallas you look in certain areas it looks like
[02:37:25.040 --> 02:37:29.840]  everything is great but there's pockets of communities in Dallas where things
[02:37:29.840 --> 02:37:34.480]  aren't so great and oh I know I grew up in Dallas you need to go we need to go
[02:37:34.480 --> 02:37:38.120]  in there and try to clean up those areas and remember during the 80s when
[02:37:38.120 --> 02:37:43.080]  Dallas was the murder capital oh yeah well it's 50 years now since the
[02:37:43.080 --> 02:37:49.400]  assassination of JFK Wow yeah and so now that comes back to light and now
[02:37:49.400 --> 02:37:55.400]  Dallas is again cast as that city you know what where JFK died and all that
[02:37:55.400 --> 02:38:00.960]  negativity that came came along with that but Alex I've always been of the
[02:38:00.960 --> 02:38:06.400]  belief that we should take care of what's wrong with our country and our
[02:38:06.400 --> 02:38:11.280]  citizens first before we step overseas to help I agree that's what we need to
[02:38:11.280 --> 02:38:15.400]  help them too yeah because they need that it says but we got to take care of
[02:38:15.400 --> 02:38:20.560]  our own how can we leave our people suffering here and in such dire straight
[02:38:20.560 --> 02:38:25.600]  type situations and then go help somebody else over there well that's what
[02:38:25.600 --> 02:38:30.240]  Jay Leno said to Obama and we'll have more here to help them over there so do
[02:38:30.240 --> 02:38:33.520]  you agree with what Jay Leno said to Obama a few nights ago he said look we
[02:38:33.520 --> 02:38:37.320]  need to quit worrying about Egypt get over here because so much of our money
[02:38:37.320 --> 02:38:40.720]  whether it's Republican or Democrat is spent they call it helping but it's
[02:38:40.720 --> 02:38:44.440]  really to help grease the skids for special interest a lot of times that
[02:38:44.440 --> 02:38:48.280]  aren't even American companies overseas right I mean it's I mean if they were
[02:38:48.280 --> 02:38:52.360]  actually sometimes greasing the skids overseas for companies that actually had
[02:38:52.360 --> 02:38:56.840]  jobs here then it might not be I mean it's not even paying off my point right
[02:38:56.840 --> 02:39:00.760]  you're right it's not and so I've always believed that that we should take
[02:39:00.760 --> 02:39:05.920]  care of our own first before we step out and help others and we can do both you
[02:39:05.920 --> 02:39:09.600]  know but charity starts at home yeah exactly and that's what we got to do
[02:39:09.600 --> 02:39:13.720]  because there's so many things that people deal with on a daily basis in
[02:39:13.720 --> 02:39:20.880]  their lives whether it be physical or mental or you know unemployment or some
[02:39:20.880 --> 02:39:25.840]  issues and you know we can to paint that picture that America is so great and
[02:39:25.840 --> 02:39:30.400]  you know everybody's living great in all that but we know that's not the true
[02:39:30.400 --> 02:39:34.240]  picture you know if you're gonna paint the picture paint the total picture and
[02:39:34.240 --> 02:39:38.840]  show you know poverty is the slums and so many air how about Detroit right now
[02:39:38.840 --> 02:39:44.320]  oh my gosh cities going down you know how can we can't put some influx of
[02:39:44.320 --> 02:39:48.680]  influx of capital or whatever is needed to bring that city back and get them
[02:39:48.680 --> 02:39:52.880]  out of well if it wasn't a ship General Motors to China yeah well that was I
[02:39:52.880 --> 02:39:55.760]  mean take the bail out take the bailout money and pay the ship into China yeah
[02:39:55.760 --> 02:39:59.600]  gee I've been I'm no rocket scientist but I think you'd actually pay to keep it
[02:39:59.600 --> 02:40:05.840]  in Detroit or right right and you see the motor automotive industry has gotten
[02:40:05.840 --> 02:40:09.760]  better in Detroit but it hasn't helped enough hasn't gotten better enough to
[02:40:09.760 --> 02:40:14.240]  help the city recover from where you know where they are and you know it's a
[02:40:14.240 --> 02:40:18.960]  tough deal I don't think many free agents in the NFL baseball NBA are
[02:40:18.960 --> 02:40:22.760]  looking you know beating their doors down to try to go to Detroit because of
[02:40:22.760 --> 02:40:27.040]  the quality of liquor sure there you talked about life after football and I
[02:40:27.040 --> 02:40:31.240]  grew up watching football you know play little football on my own haphazard way
[02:40:31.240 --> 02:40:36.120]  a family all big football fans and I liked good old-fashioned healthy football
[02:40:36.120 --> 02:40:41.200]  where it was a game and the pen and you know the people are interesting and it
[02:40:41.200 --> 02:40:45.480]  was something though that was for football time nowadays everything is
[02:40:45.480 --> 02:40:50.960]  sports related it just gets bigger and bigger and it almost makes it hollow when
[02:40:50.960 --> 02:40:53.880]  the people really aren't even excited about it it's just the only thing they
[02:40:53.880 --> 02:40:58.560]  even know to talk about to where there's not anything else but that and I know
[02:40:58.560 --> 02:41:01.200]  you make your living still out of football and love it and played it and
[02:41:01.200 --> 02:41:05.400]  you know like it and are a master of it but at the same time do you ever sit
[02:41:05.400 --> 02:41:09.160]  there and see the news leading with a sports story when something incredibly
[02:41:09.160 --> 02:41:13.760]  important isn't even on the news and like ask yourself I mean is there ever a
[02:41:13.760 --> 02:41:18.360]  point for Drew Pearson where it's too much sports yeah right now yeah and it's
[02:41:18.360 --> 02:41:22.520]  too much investigative sports you know they're making sports sound like the
[02:41:22.520 --> 02:41:26.920]  news you know there you go you know that's the gate of sports yeah and you
[02:41:26.920 --> 02:41:31.800]  know it's crazy you know I mean like the incident with the kid from A&M Johnny
[02:41:31.800 --> 02:41:37.240]  Manziel I mean they're the ones blowing this up to it's become news not only on
[02:41:37.240 --> 02:41:41.720]  the sports page but on the front pages of newspapers and as you say leading
[02:41:41.720 --> 02:41:47.880]  newscasts and things like that and it's the media that does it and the media
[02:41:47.880 --> 02:41:54.040]  kind of lumps themselves in one category one group and they feel that their
[02:41:54.040 --> 02:41:58.600]  purpose is necessary and it is but I think in a world of sports we look at
[02:41:58.600 --> 02:42:04.240]  that for enjoyment more so than finding out if a kid's signed autographs for
[02:42:04.240 --> 02:42:07.720]  seventy five hundred dollars or whatever you know and there's nothing
[02:42:07.720 --> 02:42:12.920]  there's nothing more crooked in my opinion than the NCAA you know for the
[02:42:12.920 --> 02:42:17.000]  double standards that they set you know oh yeah it's a mafia those guys on the
[02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:22.000]  the suit side are making big money associated with the NCAA but the ones
[02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:26.520]  that are getting you know screwed so to speak are the athletes what they label
[02:42:26.520 --> 02:42:30.280]  as student athletes you know and then you're a criminal if somebody gives you
[02:42:30.280 --> 02:42:33.520]  a car right but the but but the fat cats can make hundreds of millions of
[02:42:33.520 --> 02:42:37.480]  dollars yeah well the kid plays a game on national TV there's a man's a man's
[02:42:37.480 --> 02:42:41.480]  watching on TV there's a hundred thousand people sitting in that stands
[02:42:41.480 --> 02:42:45.840]  after the game where does he go you can't even go buy him a meal you know
[02:42:45.840 --> 02:42:50.160]  he's got to be careful who packs him on the back even he goes back to that dorm
[02:42:50.160 --> 02:42:54.600]  gets in those books and starts studying to try to stay eligible to play the next
[02:42:54.600 --> 02:42:58.680]  game and where does that coach go he's making three million dollars a year he
[02:42:58.680 --> 02:43:03.400]  gets in his paid car you know or he's making ten million of its Mac Brown or
[02:43:03.400 --> 02:43:08.800]  yeah Nick Saban and he you know he drives his family's got his family they
[02:43:08.800 --> 02:43:13.280]  goes to their big luxury home they sit down at a dinner table have a meal
[02:43:13.280 --> 02:43:17.080]  together while the kids eating in a dorm with other you know student athletes
[02:43:17.080 --> 02:43:21.520]  and so there's a word for it and it would be it's parasitic it's parasitic
[02:43:21.520 --> 02:43:26.560]  that's a better even better word yeah for sure and you know I I have that's
[02:43:26.560 --> 02:43:35.640]  one of my biggest pet peeves is how the NCAA is overlooking the product you
[02:43:35.640 --> 02:43:40.080]  know it was that way for a long time in the NFL when I came into the league the
[02:43:40.080 --> 02:43:44.400]  owners could do anything they want with the players a Bob Lilly all pro was
[02:43:44.400 --> 02:43:49.360]  making fifty thousand dollars back then you know after 13 years in a league and
[02:43:49.360 --> 02:43:53.800]  he's holding out my rookie year to get eighty thousand dollars you know we had
[02:43:53.800 --> 02:43:59.400]  no leverage as players to fight the NFL owners and the powers that be but once
[02:43:59.400 --> 02:44:04.240]  we started getting together as a union I went on strike four times in my 11 year
[02:44:04.240 --> 02:44:08.840]  career with the Dallas Cowboys one time in 82 we had a work stoppage where I
[02:44:08.840 --> 02:44:14.880]  mixed miss six NFL games well what that did is gave us credibility as a union so
[02:44:14.880 --> 02:44:19.360]  now the NFL owners has to deal with us and in dealing with us you see where
[02:44:19.360 --> 02:44:23.160]  these salaries are now in the NFL and that's where the divine or later is
[02:44:23.160 --> 02:44:27.000]  going to happen with college football I don't know how you're going to pay these
[02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:30.240]  kids but sooner or later they're going to have to get some of that money that's
[02:44:30.240 --> 02:44:36.040]  being generated by them the product or it almost going to like a a college
[02:44:36.040 --> 02:44:39.840]  pension for them or something you know where the money gets put into a pension
[02:44:39.840 --> 02:44:44.240]  if they get injured or if they can't get a job after then there's a college
[02:44:44.240 --> 02:44:47.600]  pension but then you wouldn't be paying paying the UT football coach what is it
[02:44:47.600 --> 02:44:52.040]  a year it's like eight million yeah and look at his record lately do what look
[02:44:52.040 --> 02:44:56.680]  at his his record one loss record lately it's not living up to the
[02:44:56.680 --> 02:45:02.320]  expectations of that salary because of the one loss record but you know that's
[02:45:02.320 --> 02:45:06.720]  that's the way the NFL is right now and hopefully well you can compare it to
[02:45:06.720 --> 02:45:10.360]  NCAA is right now excuse me and hopefully that'll that'll change over
[02:45:10.360 --> 02:45:15.520]  time but it's a great suggestion I what I suggest is so when you sign that kid
[02:45:15.520 --> 02:45:20.240]  now he's eligible for a fund if he graduates after four years there should
[02:45:20.240 --> 02:45:24.960]  be enough money in that fund where he can take that now and start to deal with
[02:45:24.960 --> 02:45:29.680]  his life after college football getting the job making that transition and all
[02:45:29.680 --> 02:45:35.440]  that but he doesn't get that money until he graduates okay that graduation might
[02:45:35.440 --> 02:45:40.720]  come 10 years after you know he played the game but at the same time that money's
[02:45:40.720 --> 02:45:45.040]  accruing and you know whenever he takes that money he'll get whatever is there
[02:45:45.040 --> 02:45:50.000]  but that's one way to do it but then you get into this the situation where you
[02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:55.200]  got the football team generating most of the income for the university and for
[02:45:55.200 --> 02:46:01.560]  the NCAA so how do you make it fair and equitable for the swimming team the golf
[02:46:01.560 --> 02:46:04.680]  team but again that's communism because because they're not bringing the draw
[02:46:04.680 --> 02:46:08.760]  they don't deserve it right and that's what's wrong they don't deserve it and
[02:46:08.760 --> 02:46:12.600]  then in the other but that's what's wrong with communism is that you take who
[02:46:12.600 --> 02:46:16.240]  produces and give to somebody else and then it's never gonna be enough right
[02:46:16.240 --> 02:46:20.280]  right I mean it's just ridiculous and then your society falls apart yes I
[02:46:20.280 --> 02:46:23.160]  mean socialism and communism just doesn't work I mean you can have a wealthy
[02:46:23.160 --> 02:46:26.680]  free market and then take some of it and try to give people a leg up and that's a
[02:46:26.680 --> 02:46:31.040]  good idea but it always becomes we can just vote ourselves everything that
[02:46:31.040 --> 02:46:34.680]  somebody else actually did like but but getting back to the union issue I
[02:46:34.680 --> 02:46:38.800]  support unions in this country a hundred years ago even 50 years ago but then
[02:46:38.800 --> 02:46:41.880]  they won't even stand up against NAFTA or GATT when it's obviously against them
[02:46:41.880 --> 02:46:46.480]  then they just become some you know group that's out for hire but exactly what
[02:46:46.480 --> 02:46:50.280]  of Americans got together as a union for liberty for the Bill of Rights and
[02:46:50.280 --> 02:46:54.120]  Constitution so special interests couldn't come in and basically get all
[02:46:54.120 --> 02:46:57.080]  that corporate welfare and take up with the country that's why they try to
[02:46:57.080 --> 02:47:00.640]  divide and conquer us everywhere drew in my view it's a world fight over
[02:47:00.640 --> 02:47:04.000]  religion race all these things that are just distractions and just on the
[02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:08.040]  surface instead of eighty five billion dollars a month's being given to foreign
[02:47:08.040 --> 02:47:12.960]  banks and QE3 nobody even knows what that term is right because it's not on the
[02:47:12.960 --> 02:47:16.560]  news and they don't want it on the news they want you worried about some college
[02:47:16.560 --> 02:47:20.120]  quarterback who might have got five thousand dollars right you know to pay for
[02:47:20.120 --> 02:47:23.880]  his you know tuition or whatever you know behind the scenes or whatever
[02:47:23.880 --> 02:47:27.840]  happened instead of foreign banks stealing trillions yeah well there's no
[02:47:27.840 --> 02:47:32.920]  question about that and that's called a media brainwashing and that's what they
[02:47:32.920 --> 02:47:40.360]  want us to talk about think about and not the other things that are that are
[02:47:40.360 --> 02:47:45.240]  most important we've got here with us you know famous Dallas Cowboy Drew
[02:47:45.240 --> 02:47:48.680]  Pearson obviously everybody knows who he is who follows football or sports at all
[02:47:48.680 --> 02:47:54.320]  and all of his extracurricular work after football with shows on Fox Sports ESPN
[02:47:54.320 --> 02:47:58.800]  has his own show is it Drew Pearson show.com Drew Pearson show.com right
[02:47:58.800 --> 02:48:02.400]  there folks and so much more okay I've been asking all the questions so far we
[02:48:02.400 --> 02:48:05.360]  got a little short segment after this we've got a few minutes for a break Drew
[02:48:05.360 --> 02:48:10.040]  you are a very popular public speaker what is the essence of what you try to
[02:48:10.040 --> 02:48:14.480]  impart to people in two minutes well I try to impart that if you want to be
[02:48:14.480 --> 02:48:18.400]  successful you got to surround yourself with six successful people and it's
[02:48:18.400 --> 02:48:22.640]  about building relationships with those people that you're associated with you
[02:48:22.640 --> 02:48:26.400]  know I've had some success in business because I surrounded myself with people
[02:48:26.400 --> 02:48:29.880]  that were smarter than me you know I think I know it all but I knew there
[02:48:29.880 --> 02:48:34.680]  there was people that have the accounting administrative selling
[02:48:34.680 --> 02:48:38.840]  expertise that I might not have but I'm smart enough to surround myself with
[02:48:38.840 --> 02:48:42.920]  those people to learn from them but one thing you're not gonna be successful in
[02:48:42.920 --> 02:48:46.480]  anything unless you have the passion for success passion that's what young
[02:48:46.480 --> 02:48:49.920]  Jevity is all about why that's why they're a successful company because they
[02:48:49.920 --> 02:48:54.800]  lead everything with passion and that passion leads to flexibility and that
[02:48:54.800 --> 02:48:58.400]  leads to efficiency and that's why they're a great company but you got to
[02:48:58.400 --> 02:49:02.040]  have the passion Drew Pearson would have never made the Dallas Cowboys if I
[02:49:02.040 --> 02:49:05.960]  didn't love football if I didn't love with everything about football the
[02:49:05.960 --> 02:49:11.760]  running the laps all the up-down drills the throwing up and all that that comes
[02:49:11.760 --> 02:49:15.560]  with you are in it to win it yeah that passion the adrenaline game and
[02:49:15.560 --> 02:49:19.480]  adrenaline you don't feel so therefore I was ready to do anything to be
[02:49:19.480 --> 02:49:23.720]  successful anything that's right within the rules to be successful because
[02:49:23.720 --> 02:49:27.480]  nowadays you say that you know players are taking all it's like Roger
[02:49:27.480 --> 02:49:31.840]  Stalbach said it was war though when you guys are going play yeah and we you
[02:49:31.840 --> 02:49:37.240]  know we came together and you know it's that that time so anyway if you bring
[02:49:37.240 --> 02:49:41.360]  passion to what you're trying to do and you surround that with yourself with the
[02:49:41.360 --> 02:49:44.960]  right people then you have a great chance to be success but I think what
[02:49:44.960 --> 02:49:48.720]  you said historically is just is what every great person has said you've got
[02:49:48.720 --> 02:49:51.680]  to have passion you've got to like what you're doing yeah you've got to be on a
[02:49:51.680 --> 02:49:56.480]  mission yeah instead of like oh I gotta get up today yeah my problem is I want
[02:49:56.480 --> 02:50:01.640]  to work too much you've got a lot of passion I need to transfer transfuse
[02:50:01.640 --> 02:50:05.160]  some of that to the cowboy players because hopefully that what they're
[02:50:05.160 --> 02:50:09.720]  missing because we see talent there but do they love the game enough to make the
[02:50:09.720 --> 02:50:14.960]  sacrifices do all this the small things pay attention to the details that lead
[02:50:14.960 --> 02:50:18.680]  to the big things do it are they committed to doing that and we're going
[02:50:18.680 --> 02:50:22.240]  to find out this season for the Cowboys let's talk about the Cowboys in the

[02:54:08.840 --> 02:54:13.960]  well folks it's our final segment with Drew Pearson and I'm really flattered
[02:54:13.960 --> 02:54:17.840]  that he flew down to Austin Texas and he's busy guy's gonna do a little bit of
[02:54:17.840 --> 02:54:21.200]  nightly news with us and then he's gonna jump back on airplane and go back and
[02:54:21.200 --> 02:54:25.000]  that the Cowboys play I guess you in Oakland tonight don't they yes they do
[02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:28.520]  second exhibition game they play five this year because they played the Hall
[02:54:28.520 --> 02:54:34.920]  of Fame nothing but rookies played last week or was it Sunday night in the
[02:54:34.920 --> 02:54:39.160]  Hall of Fame game against Miami but tonight you'll see more veterans out
[02:54:39.160 --> 02:54:43.480]  there Tony Romo will be starting rest of the veterans will get a at least one or
[02:54:43.480 --> 02:54:49.000]  two series of action because you know in the NFL it's it's you can get physical
[02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:53.320]  in shape but you got a part of your physical conditioning has got to be the
[02:54:53.320 --> 02:54:57.880]  contact part of it and you got to play the game to get that you sometimes can
[02:54:57.880 --> 02:55:02.320]  get that in practice but you really get the true feel the speed of the game for
[02:55:02.320 --> 02:55:06.960]  that contact and the type of blows you're gonna receive and get prepared for
[02:55:06.960 --> 02:55:11.800]  that only in game situations so Jason Garrett's got to play his starter some
[02:55:11.800 --> 02:55:16.560]  tonight and you just knock on wood and hope none of them gets hurt or out with
[02:55:16.560 --> 02:55:20.520]  injuries what happened to the Cowboys overall did they just get to where they
[02:55:20.520 --> 02:55:25.720]  weren't hungry anymore I just think they lost side of what it takes to be
[02:55:25.720 --> 02:55:31.360]  successful Jerry Jones came out maybe a few years ago before the stadium was
[02:55:31.360 --> 02:55:35.760]  built and said the Dallas Cowboys don't do not have to win another football game
[02:55:35.760 --> 02:55:40.480]  for the Dallas Cowboys to make money and that's true but that's that's that's a
[02:55:40.480 --> 02:55:45.120]  bad thing to say pathetic thing to say because your business is about winning
[02:55:45.120 --> 02:55:48.720]  you know it's your party you win you might be making money now but you want
[02:55:48.720 --> 02:55:53.160]  to make more money you know it's not even that well I play a game if you're
[02:55:53.160 --> 02:55:56.560]  not gonna try to win because that translates to life like it's almost like
[02:55:56.560 --> 02:56:00.120]  too big to fail well the big banks can rip everybody off but we're taxpayer
[02:56:00.120 --> 02:56:03.920]  backs is like Jerry Jones hey you paid for my stadium and screw everybody right
[02:56:03.920 --> 02:56:09.200]  and you got a nice place to come sit and watch us lose who wants to do that so
[02:56:09.200 --> 02:56:14.840]  anyway they have to get a different mindset a mindset of winning and they
[02:56:14.840 --> 02:56:20.000]  got talent they nobody says they got talent but they still it's potential
[02:56:20.000 --> 02:56:23.480]  talent meaning they haven't proved it yet so hopefully this year they can prove
[02:56:23.480 --> 02:56:26.840]  it they've made some changes I think all the changes they made in the offseason
[02:56:26.840 --> 02:56:32.180]  are positive Jason Garrett is now a head coach they call it a walk-around head
[02:56:32.180 --> 02:56:35.960]  coach where he could deal with every aspect of the football team instead of
[02:56:35.960 --> 02:56:39.360]  being just that head coach offensive coordinator where now he's just
[02:56:39.360 --> 02:56:44.400]  concentrating mostly on offense and letting other aspects of the the team
[02:56:44.400 --> 02:56:48.480]  and issues with the team slipped through the cracks like a manager yeah and
[02:56:48.480 --> 02:56:52.040]  that's what you need is a head coach now Landry was different he could handle it
[02:56:52.040 --> 02:56:56.600]  he was not only the manager but he put the offensive game plan together he put
[02:56:56.600 --> 02:57:00.520]  the defensive game plan together and on Sundays he called the offensive plays
[02:57:00.520 --> 02:57:05.240]  but at the same time he was still good enough that he can manage the situation
[02:57:05.240 --> 02:57:09.840]  because he was experienced you know he's coached 29 years for the Dallas Cowboys
[02:57:09.840 --> 02:57:14.280]  but Jason Garrett is not there yet so he needs to focus on just being the head
[02:57:14.280 --> 02:57:18.760]  coach so now Bill Callahan is calling plays and this is going to be good for
[02:57:18.760 --> 02:57:23.200]  Romo because he's been hearing from Jason Garrett for the last nine years now
[02:57:23.200 --> 02:57:27.360]  he gets to hear from some another voice and somebody else in his ear and that
[02:57:27.360 --> 02:57:31.200]  person hopefully will tell him not only what he's doing well but what he's doing
[02:57:31.200 --> 02:57:36.400]  wrong as well and folks can find out more at Drew Pearson show dot com yes and
