[01:09.240 --> 01:13.360]  question why is the rest of Congress other than he and a few others like
[01:13.360 --> 01:19.720]  Ron Paul acting like potted plants while open out-of-control wholesale tyranny
[01:19.720 --> 01:30.160]  is engaged in so that is coming up today with Congressman Walter B. Jones also for

[01:37.960 --> 01:42.080]  Roberts is going to be coming on to discuss the implosion of the euro by
[01:42.080 --> 01:49.160]  design and the Greek bank runs that are taking place right now again I've had
[01:49.160 --> 01:56.000]  Max Kaiser dr. Tarpley first really of six seven years ago saying this
[01:56.000 --> 02:02.280]  Roberts Bob Chapman especially we got to get him back on so many others
[02:02.280 --> 02:09.120]  countless guests my analysis as well but Jim Tucker that there was a planned
[02:09.120 --> 02:14.400]  implosion of Europe the question is have they overcooked the goose have they
[02:14.400 --> 02:19.000]  have they so debilitated the population and gotten them dependent and got and
[02:19.000 --> 02:25.600]  signed them on to so many thousands of trillions of fake banker debt that the
[02:25.600 --> 02:30.560]  parasite wanting to weaken the host has gone too far many an empire including
[02:30.560 --> 02:35.280]  this new synthetic corporate fascist cloaked power behind the throne
[02:35.280 --> 02:42.200]  creeping treachery conspiracy has debilitated the system such a great
[02:42.200 --> 02:48.080]  extent that it's imploding so that is coming up by the way you know I love the
[02:48.080 --> 02:51.800]  general statements by Miss America if you want to win Miss America you've got
[02:51.800 --> 02:54.920]  to endorse the UN is creating the planet Earth and loving all the little
[02:54.920 --> 03:00.840]  children and 20 birds to and just being loving and sweets he cake and non-threatening
[03:00.840 --> 03:05.040]  as non-threatening as Bill Gates wanting to give you a loving vaccine
[03:05.040 --> 03:08.040]  because he cares about you or of course he writes about one to reduce
[03:08.040 --> 03:12.080]  population through vaccines but he's still a nice person so his dad headed up
[03:12.080 --> 03:16.280]  Planned Parenthood and is a eugenicist never mind he's got a shot so in one
[03:16.280 --> 03:21.920]  country alone his program giving people the polio vaccine has given 46,000 plus
[03:21.920 --> 03:29.640]  children last year welcome different variances of being paralyzed doesn't
[03:29.640 --> 03:34.800]  matter it's as non-threatening as Warren Buffett another eugenicist with an
[03:34.800 --> 03:40.320]  ice cream cone look it's okay he poses and photographs with ice cream could a
[03:40.320 --> 03:46.680]  man with an ice cream cone be bad certainly not sad issue the world
[03:46.680 --> 03:50.600]  wildlife fund the UN is always saying we want to tax the west and give it to big
[03:50.600 --> 03:55.560]  private bankers of course but they say we want to tax you to help the little
[03:55.560 --> 04:00.440]  black people and others we love them so much and then two years ago we got the
[04:00.440 --> 04:05.640]  Copenhagen Treaty and it said right at double just one point below double the
[04:05.640 --> 04:09.640]  taxes on the third world that they'd have on the west and the money wasn't
[04:09.640 --> 04:15.320]  going to go to build up third-world countries and industrialism that by
[04:15.320 --> 04:17.440]  what that would actually make them not have more kids you think that's the
[04:17.440 --> 04:21.520]  problem no no no they have a better plan they're gonna shut your resources off

[04:40.800 --> 04:44.920]  government wanted to get the economy going no no that's why they paid 20
[04:44.920 --> 04:49.360]  plus billion to build factories in China and move General Motors out of the

[08:28.040 --> 08:34.960]  this is going to be an ultra massive transmission ultra massive payload of
[08:34.960 --> 08:40.600]  truth directed right at the mountains of steaming lies that spew out of the
[08:40.600 --> 08:48.040]  bottomless pit where the new world order resides like a big diseased spider and
[08:48.040 --> 08:52.000]  convicting Obama as the criminal globalist he is in the court of public
[08:52.000 --> 08:58.080]  opinion is going well Oprah Winfrey now doesn't like Obama and his wife
[08:58.080 --> 09:03.160]  Oprah Winfrey is rich and powerful but I think is manipulated at many levels I
[09:03.160 --> 09:08.600]  don't think she's purely evil like teleprompter reader minion Obama and
[09:08.600 --> 09:13.840]  Michelle so there's a big fight between those two also it turns out the
[09:13.840 --> 09:18.880]  Kennedys don't like Obama and the Democrats because well they think
[09:18.880 --> 09:22.520]  they're selling out to the whole police state that's in the news so you've got
[09:22.520 --> 09:27.840]  these mainline idiot liberals who who aren't total new world order fascist
[09:27.840 --> 09:33.200]  they're just not sophisticated enough to understand the larger program that's
[09:33.200 --> 09:36.280]  why you've had Kennedys come out and criticize the vaccines and autism and
[09:36.280 --> 09:41.400]  you know they don't support most of the eugenics in Africa they're just not
[09:41.400 --> 09:46.720]  smart I mean their great-grandaddy knew how to run hundreds of millions of
[09:46.720 --> 09:51.880]  dollars and that was in 20s numbers of liquor they became very rich they're
[09:51.880 --> 09:57.880]  just a mafia family who became you know supposed you know trendies because they
[09:57.880 --> 10:02.760]  wanted to have civil rights and that's why they killed JFK because he was a real
[10:02.760 --> 10:08.400]  guy he wasn't perfect but he was a real guy side issue that's in the news it's
[10:08.400 --> 10:12.120]  not our top story by any means I just thought I'd mention that so I was
[10:12.120 --> 10:15.540]  talking about bottomless pit filled with new world order spiders we have
[10:15.540 --> 10:20.120]  representative Walter B. Jones joining us talk about getting more co-sponsors
[10:20.120 --> 10:25.240]  for his bill to begin the procedures for impeaching Obama for launching wars
[10:25.240 --> 10:29.280]  without congressional approval clear violation of the Constitution he'll be
[10:29.280 --> 10:32.520]  joining us 30 minutes in the third hour and of course Paul Craig Roberts on the
[10:32.520 --> 10:41.960]  accelerated design implosion of the euro as they snack on Ireland Greece then
[10:41.960 --> 10:53.040]  Italy and then moving along into Spain and Portugal and other areas and when
[10:53.040 --> 11:02.880]  you guys are ready with that just give me a thumbs up you guys gonna give me a
[11:02.880 --> 11:08.920]  thumbs up just just acknowledge you will I'm not even gonna air it now it's just
[11:08.920 --> 11:13.080]  I want to know if we did have it ready because I didn't know I can hardly see
[11:13.080 --> 11:17.840]  through that glass and I I can see the thumbs up good thank you Houston thank
[11:17.840 --> 11:24.360]  you wonderful thank you and speaking of that coming up yeah I've heard this for
[11:24.360 --> 11:30.400]  years online and I'm gonna get Rob do to do an updated version with some new
[11:30.400 --> 11:35.480]  images for TV viewers of the nightly news every night at 7 o'clock but we're
[11:35.480 --> 11:40.640]  going to air here on the radio Paul Harvey from back in the early 90s
[11:40.640 --> 11:48.680]  little piece he did called if I were the devil and he shows amazing of course the
[11:48.680 --> 11:54.760]  late great Paul Harvey understanding and in in in piercing knowledge that they
[11:54.760 --> 12:00.020]  want kids to be bad and out of control and and tell parents not to raise their
[12:00.020 --> 12:05.000]  children or discipline them so they become lawless immoral creatures to
[12:05.000 --> 12:09.880]  create a crisis in society so they can take some of them and make them a moral
[12:09.880 --> 12:14.520]  police and bureaucrats and enforcers but then also take the others and use them
[12:14.520 --> 12:20.760]  to menace hard-working moral people that have still hung on this is a exact
[12:20.760 --> 12:26.880]  program and I've always wanted to re-air this since Harvey died three four
[12:26.880 --> 12:30.680]  years ago I've never done any died no nine so we're gonna air that coming up
[12:30.680 --> 12:37.680]  at the bottom of the hour today so that is what's coming up let me just do this
[12:37.680 --> 12:42.000]  now let me just read to you some of the headlines the Washington Post admits that
[12:42.000 --> 12:46.440]  the West is funding real al-Qaeda in attacking Syria and we have an article
[12:46.440 --> 12:50.440]  at info wars comm linking to all the admissions and that they're now moving
[12:50.440 --> 12:58.120]  al-Qaeda into Lebanon of course there's real resistors to Israel the media then
[12:58.120 --> 13:01.600]  calls that terrorism but the support Israel or not let's be honest anybody
[13:01.600 --> 13:06.360]  that even throws a rock and resistance is called a terrorist so the point is
[13:06.360 --> 13:12.080]  they're calling the Iranian backed Hezbollah terrorists there and they do
[13:12.080 --> 13:15.800]  engage in tactics that could be called terrorism well they're sending an al-Qaeda
[13:15.800 --> 13:20.960]  now I guess to try to dig them out my only point is al-Qaeda is run by the
[13:20.960 --> 13:25.440]  West I mean that's a fact they didn't just create it they still run it and I'm
[13:25.440 --> 13:29.080]  so sick of hearing how they saved me from this underwear bomber they got on the
[13:29.080 --> 13:34.120]  airplane or the double agent CIA oh my gosh the he infiltrated the bomb makers
[13:34.120 --> 13:38.960]  you might as well watch Saturday morning cartoons you'll get more reality than
[13:38.960 --> 13:45.640]  what you're being told it's ridiculous but that's in the news another report
[13:45.640 --> 13:51.440]  US and Saudi Arabia have hatched a backup plan to destroy Syria we're gonna
[13:51.440 --> 13:58.240]  be going over that but in the biggest news obviously that we're gonna be going
[13:58.240 --> 14:04.080]  over here today big bank runs in Greece spreading into the rest of Europe and
[14:04.080 --> 14:08.240]  all the experts we've talked to in my own common sense and what the feds are
[14:08.240 --> 14:12.360]  prepared for the so-called feds the government managers for the bankers the
[14:12.360 --> 14:16.640]  foreign banks that have hijacked the US and captured us I do come to you from
[14:16.640 --> 14:20.920]  behind enemy lines in occupied former republic of the United States of
[14:20.920 --> 14:28.680]  America now bankers stand our money our taxes our young men and women women we
[14:28.680 --> 14:32.840]  are the fuel of the new world order we're not we're not the new world order
[14:32.840 --> 14:38.280]  we're the fuel we're the food as long as they wrap tyranny in the American flag
[14:38.280 --> 14:44.600]  most folks will salute it go right down the rat hole sorry so coming up we'll
[14:44.600 --> 14:50.320]  get into the Greek news very very important and then we'll get into
[14:50.320 --> 14:54.600]  World Wildlife Fund calls for global poverty to save the planet oh yes this
[14:54.600 --> 15:00.440]  is the public statement UN IMF World Bank Goldman Sachs JP Morgan State
[15:00.440 --> 15:06.280]  Department Department of Defense Club of Rome Builderburg Group CFR
[15:06.280 --> 15:11.200]  Trilateral Commission they all make public statements their members do or
[15:11.200 --> 15:15.000]  they put out official reports that they want to post industrial world with
[15:15.000 --> 15:18.360]  high-tech government and corporate reservations where they fly above us in
[15:18.360 --> 15:22.280]  high-tech jet planes and helicopters and have life extension technology and
[15:22.280 --> 15:27.520]  we're on the outside being pumped full of GMO and dying at about age 50 if they
[15:27.520 --> 15:31.920]  even allow us to breed and why because that's what they like just like every
[15:31.920 --> 15:36.960]  feudal system enjoyed the surfs being a foot shorter in Japan a foot shorter in
[15:36.960 --> 15:43.280]  China a foot shorter in Europe a foot shorter in every culture in the Aztec
[15:43.280 --> 15:49.680]  Kingdom foot shorter they even wrote right little little sonnets and poems
[15:49.680 --> 15:54.600]  about the little people and and and they knew food was a weapon so they would
[15:54.600 --> 15:58.400]  keep them on tiny pieces a lot of the children will be stillborn or mentally
[15:58.400 --> 16:02.240]  retarded or have mental problems from lack of nutrition this is just a gift
[16:02.240 --> 16:09.240]  from from the sickening ruling class throughout history because sitting
[16:09.240 --> 16:14.640]  there in their castle they don't like watching the beautiful maiden the
[16:14.640 --> 16:21.520]  Miller's daughter they want to see her blind from simple mineral decision
[16:21.520 --> 16:29.760]  policies they want to see you diseased and stunted the samurai were told is so
[16:29.760 --> 16:33.560]  noble they would get a new blade and go out into the rice paddies and find a
[16:33.560 --> 16:39.320]  peasant to exercise power and hack them up just as an exercise of power so
[16:39.320 --> 16:44.920]  everyone could bend down and bow to them this is what the control freaks like
[16:44.920 --> 16:50.600]  okay they love elitist walking around at a public event and looking at everyone
[16:50.600 --> 16:54.440]  they're poisoning and killing with soft kill and feeling full of propaganda they
[16:54.440 --> 16:58.160]  did they just got you because you won't break the trance they've got you right
[16:58.160 --> 17:03.080]  where they want you and you won't break the trance and it's funny to them you
[17:03.080 --> 17:06.800]  know I was invited to a South by Southwest party and I didn't know when
[17:06.800 --> 17:09.800]  they were saying yeah that's the president of Facebook yeah that's the
[17:09.800 --> 17:14.920]  you know the former head the head guy of Napster Aaron said who was he and showed

[17:21.120 --> 17:24.840]  crazed at the Four Seasons party we were at and then I went to another party and
[17:24.840 --> 17:28.720]  it was his party and I again I think I know these elitist are really you know
[17:28.720 --> 17:32.360]  he's a billionaire but I knew he was but I knew he'd been at Bilderberg but

[34:46.160 --> 34:52.880]  US oh I seem to have heard the exact order from Bob Chapman and others on
[34:52.880 --> 35:01.800]  this show hmm because it's a planned program you know we hear Bilderberg
[35:01.800 --> 35:05.200]  leaks going oh they want to meet about how to fix it yeah they're gonna be like
[35:05.200 --> 35:09.240]  oh gee how do we fix the old lady we knocked over the head and stole her
[35:09.240 --> 35:14.960]  purse that means when they say fix it's like that means how do we how do we act
[35:14.960 --> 35:18.800]  like we're coming up with a solution that gives us more power on something we
[35:18.800 --> 35:24.760]  created the austerity we've got to raise your taxes to pay the money you owe
[35:24.760 --> 35:29.200]  Greece turns out 90 plus percent just like Iceland and Ireland is not owed by
[35:29.200 --> 35:34.200]  the people their criminal governments all former Goldman Sachs execs or JP Morgan
[35:34.200 --> 35:41.440]  almost all of them are Goldman Sachs signed on to the derivatives debt oh
[35:41.440 --> 35:45.280]  here I signed you on to debt maybe like if I went out and bought a house and put
[35:45.280 --> 35:52.240]  5% down on it and then came to you and said yeah you owe me $300,000 you're
[35:52.240 --> 35:55.520]  like I didn't buy that house you did I didn't matter I had the government say
[35:55.520 --> 36:00.320]  that you owe my debt now and I'll send arm tax collectors to take the money
[36:00.320 --> 36:06.460]  you're gonna pay for my house $300,000 you've been like that's insane you
[36:06.460 --> 36:12.160]  bet it is thousands of cases confirmed in court where major banks are taking
[36:12.160 --> 36:16.000]  houses that not only do they not have the deed to because it was sold in
[36:16.000 --> 36:20.120]  derivatives over and over again the media tries to muddy the water like that
[36:20.120 --> 36:25.000]  no no no where the house is totally paid for in some cases I saw a case where
[36:25.000 --> 36:29.480]  it had been paid for for over 30 years and had been passed on by parents to
[36:29.480 --> 36:36.880]  their daughter been passed on totally paid for property taxes paid private
[36:36.880 --> 36:40.280]  tax the bankers as well that's not constitutional only had that the last
[36:40.280 --> 36:46.640]  60 years or so and a big mega bank comes in and takes or your house is paid for
[36:46.640 --> 36:51.200]  for 11 years and in that case in Florida that I covered that because
[36:51.200 --> 36:55.600]  everybody's heard of that one Bank of America never owned it there was no deed
[36:55.600 --> 37:00.680]  the people had the deed they'd paid for it cash a decade plus before and what
[37:00.680 --> 37:07.640]  1.1 mil was it 1.2 mil we could play that newscast what was it titled Bank of
[37:07.640 --> 37:12.320]  America foreclosed on and because of you know the court finally ruled because it
[37:12.320 --> 37:16.320]  was so obvious look you took a house one years give it back and they wouldn't
[37:16.320 --> 37:22.400]  this went on for six months so the local judge said all right in that case it
[37:22.400 --> 37:29.360]  was constables said go in there and go take the money out of the till they went
[37:29.360 --> 37:32.960]  right in and took it that's what the courts if they serve the people and
[37:32.960 --> 37:37.680]  we're just would be doing across the board and finally the bankers called you
[37:37.680 --> 37:41.360]  know his his head office and they said okay we'll write you the check we'll
[37:41.360 --> 37:45.120]  write you the check and we'll give you the house back and then they signed the
[37:45.120 --> 37:50.840]  documents and handed it over right there that's the criminality of what we're
[37:50.840 --> 37:56.240]  facing it's just as insane or even more so when Obama says no Congress I don't
[37:56.240 --> 37:59.560]  need to come to you to launch a war in Libya Syria anywhere else and the
[37:59.560 --> 38:02.720]  Congress says well yeah you do it's this article in that article it's the law
[38:02.720 --> 38:09.000]  Constitution and he says no I have the UN and then he sends in surly Panetta with
[38:09.000 --> 38:16.440]  the generals who had the exact type of surly attitude that I've seen with 16
[38:16.440 --> 38:20.880]  year olds when they finally dad says hey carry out the trash you know I've been
[38:20.880 --> 38:24.600]  working all week you need to do something around here and the surly 16 year
[38:24.600 --> 38:27.640]  old just thinks their dad's being mean to him not that hey you're gonna move out
[38:27.640 --> 38:30.280]  soon you're gonna have to carry out the trash all the time you're gonna have to
[38:30.280 --> 38:34.120]  cook dinner you're gonna have to clean the house hey carry the trash out the
[38:34.120 --> 38:38.920]  16 year old bucks up and it's ready for a fist fight with dad it is that they
[38:38.920 --> 38:43.080]  have sir I played that video over and over again on air they you got to go
[38:43.080 --> 38:46.600]  watch it remember about a month and a half ago we're Panetta in them just have
[38:46.600 --> 38:52.600]  this arrogant flimpy attitude and the generals are looking like wolves at
[38:52.600 --> 38:56.680]  those congressmen because they can go right into their tax accounts they know
[38:56.680 --> 39:00.600]  what mistresses they've got they've already reviewed because it's a power
[39:00.600 --> 39:06.720]  trip their phone records what they're into sexual dossiers oh it's come out
[39:06.720 --> 39:10.200]  the Pentagon can just dial right in your bank accounts everything your entire
[39:10.200 --> 39:14.480]  where you've surfed what you've done they've got quick one-page pull downs
[39:14.480 --> 39:19.280]  they're looking at all these congressmen up there and they got dirt on every one
[39:19.280 --> 39:22.680]  of them or they'll plant it if they don't have it they'll just spoof it and put
[39:22.680 --> 39:25.880]  child born on your computer they and they're sitting there like hardcore
[39:25.880 --> 39:30.920]  criminal gangsters the Joint Chiefs of Staff just political suck-up trash
[39:30.920 --> 39:37.080]  appointed by the criminal president the Auslander usurping criminal use piece of
[39:37.080 --> 39:42.640]  trash new world order puppet teleprompter reading traitorous larcenist maggot
[39:42.640 --> 39:47.960]  that is teleprompter in chief Obama and they're all in there it's just so funny
[39:47.960 --> 39:53.720]  to the potted plants up there on the stage and they kept saying but you got
[39:53.720 --> 39:56.960]  to come to us launch a war and the general's eyes would all get real stern
[39:56.960 --> 40:00.640]  and I guarantee you they're thinking little man you have no idea the
[40:00.640 --> 40:03.920]  panopticon that's been built by the eugenicists because they've been let in
[40:03.920 --> 40:07.920]  on the big program at that level you have no idea the decapitation space
[40:07.920 --> 40:14.080]  planes in orbit with du meteor guns Sabo weapons systems you have no idea we
[40:14.080 --> 40:18.560]  have that's them thinking the globalist we now have discovered and developed any
[40:18.560 --> 40:22.280]  matter weapons we can blow the whole planet up you have no idea the particle
[40:22.280 --> 40:26.720]  beam weapons we've got you have nothing you have no idea that flowing through
[40:26.720 --> 40:30.120]  your veins is sodium fluoride and hundreds of other chemicals and GMO
[40:30.120 --> 40:37.560]  designed for soft kill we murder we dominate we have the power
[40:40.520 --> 40:44.440]  I was there at that elitist party there was hundreds of people there but it was
[40:44.440 --> 40:47.120]  like you know president of this president of that running around they were all
[40:47.120 --> 40:55.120]  running around crazed on design or something in my view I'm sitting back
[40:55.120 --> 41:00.120]  because it's you know just just watching the spectacle as they hop around and then every
[41:00.120 --> 41:03.160]  time somebody say it's Alex Jones introduce them they would just totally
[41:03.160 --> 41:08.920]  go just look crazed and then slap me on the shoulder and literally run off into
[41:08.920 --> 41:12.720]  the crowd I guess that's the trendy thing when like hey this is Alex Jones and
[41:12.720 --> 41:16.600]  here's the billionaire guy and it's the globalist they just like just crazed I
[41:16.600 --> 41:20.640]  mean let me try to give you the craze look I can't even do it just like I'm
[41:20.640 --> 41:28.080]  crazed just full will to power the planet's mind we're poisoning everyone
[41:28.080 --> 41:35.960]  public has no idea nothing can stop us and you just want to be able to reach
[41:35.960 --> 41:40.440]  out to people you just want to wake up humanity your fellow humans you love
[41:40.440 --> 41:44.240]  you want good for humanity you want to go to the stars and you look at the
[41:44.240 --> 41:50.040]  horrible demons that we've let take control and how they've sold us on
[41:50.040 --> 41:53.880]  torture and secret arrest and all the corrupt things that people think is
[41:53.880 --> 41:58.000]  manly now all the cop shows where they torture people and butcher the bill of
[41:58.000 --> 42:02.080]  rights and celebrate it's the right thing to do and boy they get the job done
[42:02.080 --> 42:05.600]  and the arrested development and the way they've got men acting where they had
[42:05.600 --> 42:10.000]  women acting and people all petty and all these petty trendies trendies of
[42:10.000 --> 42:15.600]  every type who are all on these private power trips themselves about how their
[42:15.600 --> 42:19.080]  winners and they don't care what you think because they've got a high image of
[42:19.080 --> 42:24.000]  themselves but it's a fake image they're the opposite of humble people will
[42:24.000 --> 42:28.280]  take my aggression and resistance as arrogance or ego it's the opposite it's
[42:28.280 --> 42:33.480]  just desperate cornered animal scratching and squealing like a cornered
[42:33.480 --> 42:37.120]  raccoon trying to warn other raccoons don't come this way you're gonna get
[42:37.120 --> 42:42.480]  grabbed you know what I mean or a cow in a slaughterhouse shoot I've gotten down
[42:42.480 --> 42:46.840]  to the end and I see those big gas bolts slinging down and hitting those cows in
[42:46.840 --> 42:50.920]  the head the big machines grabbing them by the legs and dragging them up and a
[42:50.920 --> 42:54.800]  big old razor blade comes in and slits that throat and I see blood shooting out
[42:54.800 --> 42:58.280]  all over the place that's the analogy and I'm like man that you don't want to go
[42:58.280 --> 43:04.840]  down this road see I'm not a cow I'm homo sapien sapien in the image of my
[43:04.840 --> 43:10.160]  creator my progeny your progeny is meant to go to the stars we are only in an
[43:10.160 --> 43:15.360]  embryonic phase right now and I don't want a cancer of malfunctioning twisted
[43:15.360 --> 43:21.000]  dark-side people to be able to take control I know men and women of goodness
[43:21.000 --> 43:26.400]  are much stronger and more powerful than these little rats but the system has
[43:26.400 --> 43:30.720]  sold the idea that evil is gonna give people power and beguiled and seduced
[43:30.720 --> 43:34.740]  people into it and the deeper you get into evil the weaker you get and the
[43:34.740 --> 43:37.840]  more pathetic and the more insecure and then you think if you just get into
[43:37.840 --> 43:42.680]  deeper evil you'll find the power you were promised evil is a con game
[43:42.680 --> 43:47.840]  there's nothing but destruction and shame at the end of it you will not be
[43:47.840 --> 43:55.240]  fulfilled by it don't you understand that cowardice and weakness and envy and
[43:55.240 --> 44:03.120]  all of it will only bring you down and I thought this is what billionaires do
[44:03.120 --> 44:09.720]  this is what oh a helicopter ride the best women palaces if you don't have
[44:09.720 --> 44:15.040]  an appreciation of what's good it's all a dungeon but people who've never seen
[44:15.040 --> 44:19.320]  it or had access to it have no idea they all think it's that unknown country and
[44:19.320 --> 44:24.240]  the system dangles the bobbles and Kim Kardashian and Justin Bieber out in front
[44:24.240 --> 44:30.240]  of you as if they are living in some volholic world I mean there's not many
[44:30.240 --> 44:34.880]  people in Hollywood bigger than Charlie Sheen over the years but I have met and
[44:34.880 --> 44:39.520]  gotten to know people as big or even bigger who don't go on record on this
[44:39.520 --> 44:46.320]  show and they are miserable people they are unhappy people and the only ones
[44:46.320 --> 44:52.560]  that are happy are those that have found reality and now know it's all baloney
[44:52.880 --> 44:55.880]  those of you that think you're not adequate because you're not flying
[44:55.880 --> 44:59.480]  around in helicopters or because you're not having sex with Kim Kardashian
[44:59.480 --> 45:04.840]  ladies and gentlemen I'll guarantee you Kim Kardashian would be hell on earth
[45:04.840 --> 45:09.040]  to live with and would be terrible her lifestyle with all those empty people
[45:09.040 --> 45:15.560]  you're in a room with empty people like that you can feel it you can feel it
[45:15.560 --> 45:22.160]  there's no oxygen in the room let me tell you something you find some good
[45:22.160 --> 45:25.360]  old-fashioned country people who are Christians that aren't throwing at your
[45:25.360 --> 45:29.360]  face and sitting around on the back porch while grandma snaps the peas and
[45:29.360 --> 45:33.400]  cooks them for dinner that's where you're gonna feel a soul that's where you're
[45:33.400 --> 45:37.320]  gonna feel fulfilled that's where you're gonna feel strength when you see
[45:37.320 --> 45:41.560]  people activist out there confronting the globalist by themselves with a sign
[45:41.560 --> 45:44.520]  on the side of the street you go up and talk to that person you got dinner with
[45:44.520 --> 45:49.400]  that person you get to know that person that's somebody who's got deep living
[45:49.400 --> 45:52.840]  water flowing through them that's somebody who's tied in to the life
[45:52.840 --> 45:59.320]  force of the entire universe and everything that's decent evil is not
[45:59.320 --> 46:06.480]  going to fulfill you I got a lot of news I want to cover on Google the admitted
[46:06.480 --> 46:09.840]  government front run by the NSA that came out the news this week they said
[46:09.840 --> 46:14.680]  yeah it's NSA but courts rule it can stay secret yeah there at airfields with
[46:14.680 --> 46:18.160]  NASA uh-huh yeah these guys are all just front people to make it look sexy for
[46:18.160 --> 46:22.560]  the kids to make the new tech people rock stars to be a distraction for the
[46:22.560 --> 46:28.440]  NSA globalist banker program yeah they're all you Genesis mm-hmm and see
[46:28.440 --> 46:32.560]  that's the enjoyment they love the fact that they can see and everybody else
[46:32.560 --> 46:36.680]  can't around them but as soon as you can see they're like a vampire at high noon
[46:36.680 --> 46:42.200]  hauled out and hammered up to the mast it's like a vampire in the middle of the
[46:42.200 --> 46:46.760]  ocean nailed to the top mast folks there's no where they can go they're in
[46:46.760 --> 46:50.680]  a sea of consciousness
[46:52.040 --> 47:00.480]  surrounded by water in the noonday sun they burn away they are weak and it
[47:00.480 --> 47:03.960]  takes their power when you're not scared of them anymore and when you see what
[47:03.960 --> 47:13.840]  they are tumors big stinking pus filled reeking tumors they're tumors and all
[47:13.840 --> 47:18.400]  they want to do is kill you all they wonder they've already lost all they
[47:18.400 --> 47:25.160]  want to do is drag you into their rat hole with them remember that I want to
[47:25.160 --> 47:30.440]  go to this short piece this is Paul Harvey and then I have comments after it
[47:30.440 --> 47:36.360]  airs this is Paul Harvey on if I was the devil and and this was recorded back
[47:36.360 --> 47:41.480]  in 1993 I believe we'll have it up on screen for prison planet TV viewers think
[47:41.480 --> 47:47.680]  of how much of this has now come true think of what we've become think of how
[47:47.680 --> 47:51.240]  we bought into globalism I didn't but a lot of it and where the where the
[47:51.240 --> 47:57.760]  prosperity go was all lies you're gonna buy more lies from liars Paul Harvey if
[47:57.760 --> 48:08.360]  I was the devil if I were the devil if I were the devil if I were the prince of
[48:08.360 --> 48:12.240]  darkness I'd want to engulf the whole world in darkness and I'd have a third
[48:12.240 --> 48:15.760]  of its real estate and four fifths of its population but I wouldn't be happy
[48:15.760 --> 48:21.880]  until I had seized the ripest apple on the tree the so I said about however
[48:21.880 --> 48:26.920]  necessary to take over the United States I'd subvert the churches first I'd
[48:26.920 --> 48:30.840]  begin with a campaign of whispers with the wisdom of the serpent I would whisper
[48:30.840 --> 48:36.120]  to you as I whispered to Eve do as you please to the young I would whisper that
[48:36.120 --> 48:40.280]  the Bible is a myth I would convince them that man created God instead of the
[48:40.280 --> 48:43.960]  other way around I would confide that what's bad is good and what's good is
[48:43.960 --> 48:51.480]  square and the old I would teach to pray after me our father which art in
[48:51.480 --> 48:57.640]  Washington and then I'd get organized I'd educate authors in how to make a
[48:57.640 --> 49:00.960]  lurid literature exciting so that anything else would appear dull and
[49:00.960 --> 49:05.520]  uninteresting I'd threaten TV with dirtier movies and vice versa I'd peddle
[49:05.520 --> 49:09.160]  narcotics to whom I could I'd sell alcohol to ladies and gentlemen of
[49:09.160 --> 49:13.760]  distinction I'd tranquilize the rest with pills if I were the devil I'd
[49:13.760 --> 49:17.160]  soon have families at war with themselves churches at war with
[49:17.160 --> 49:22.360]  themselves and nations at war with themselves until each in its turn was
[49:22.360 --> 49:28.280]  consumed and with promises of higher ratings I'd have mesmerizing media
[49:28.280 --> 49:33.840]  fanning the flames if I were the devil I would encourage schools to refine young
[49:33.840 --> 49:38.160]  intellects but neglected discipline emotions just let those run wild until
[49:38.160 --> 49:42.160]  before you knew it you'd have to have drug sniffing dogs and metal detectors
[49:42.160 --> 49:48.840]  at every schoolhouse door within a decade I'd have prisons overflowing I'd
[49:48.840 --> 49:53.840]  have judges promoting pornography soon I could evict God from the courthouse then
[49:53.840 --> 49:57.680]  from the schoolhouse and then from the houses of Congress and in his own
[49:57.680 --> 50:02.680]  churches I would substitute psychology for religion and deify science I would
[50:02.680 --> 50:07.960]  lure priests and pastors into misusing boys and girls and church money if I
[50:07.960 --> 50:11.160]  were the devil I'd make the symbol of Easter and egg and the symbol of
[50:11.160 --> 50:16.640]  Christmas a bottle if I were the devil I'd take from those who have and give to
[50:16.640 --> 50:22.240]  those who wanted until I had killed the incentive of the ambitious what'll you
[50:22.240 --> 50:29.040]  bet I couldn't get whole states to promote gambling as the way to get
[50:29.040 --> 50:37.240]  rich I would caution against extremes in hard work in patriotism in moral
[50:37.240 --> 50:42.880]  conduct I would convince the young that marriage is old-fashioned that swinging
[50:42.880 --> 50:49.920]  is more fun that what you see on TV is the way to be and thus I could undress
[50:49.920 --> 50:57.080]  you in public and I could lure you into bed with diseases for which there is no
[50:57.080 --> 51:02.720]  cure in other words if I were the devil I just keep right on doing what he's
[51:02.720 --> 51:17.080]  doing Paul Harvey good day 1918 2009 he recorded that back in 1993 now which we
[51:17.080 --> 51:19.560]  had a better recording of it that's the best we could find on YouTube we're
[51:19.560 --> 51:22.040]  gonna try to mess with the audio make it better for the nightly news this
[51:22.040 --> 51:26.320]  evening by the way we have something really special Friday on the nightly
[51:26.320 --> 51:33.040]  news I'm just gonna leave it at that something very special on the nightly news
[51:33.040 --> 51:36.400]  and no it's not Dave Mustaine he's gonna be in town to my did an interview with
[51:36.400 --> 51:42.800]  him and have that Monday or maybe Friday but the point is I've got something
[51:42.800 --> 51:47.240]  really special it is special we have Dave on to or any other great guests we
[51:47.240 --> 51:52.240]  have but something special Friday that we put a lot of work into something new
[51:52.240 --> 51:58.960]  we're developing here at info wars.com and if you think this show is gonna be
[51:58.960 --> 52:03.400]  powerful Friday wait till you see what we do in two weeks that's at prison
[52:03.400 --> 52:11.920]  planet dot TV there's a 15-day free trial at prison planet dot TV right now we
[52:11.920 --> 52:19.720]  do have dr. Paul Craig Roberts coming up at the five after break on the euro so I
[52:19.720 --> 52:27.640]  will just cover that right now but I thought that I would first plug a few
[52:27.640 --> 52:34.440]  things here on air might as well I just skipped the network break anyways I do
[52:34.440 --> 52:38.840]  that a lot boy let me tell you that causes a fracas so I'm one of these talk
[52:38.840 --> 52:42.000]  show hosts who actually wants to skip the breaks most people are leaning on the
[52:42.000 --> 52:47.720]  microphone leaning on callers leaning on guests I want to fight tyranny so bad
[52:47.720 --> 52:51.760]  which is the normal instinct for me I guess it should be for everybody that I
[52:51.760 --> 52:59.200]  could go for 10 hours here on air but I don't because I degenerate after a while
[52:59.200 --> 53:05.680]  and it's bad radio but enough about that I just believe in total transparency
[53:05.680 --> 53:09.960]  that's why I'm always talking about what I do what I'm thinking I'm trying to get
[53:09.960 --> 53:15.320]  you to walk through my thought processes so you can understand from my research
[53:15.320 --> 53:18.800]  perspective where we are and I found that by doing that if you can get in my
[53:18.800 --> 53:24.440]  shoes I can get in your shoes and we can really look at this through the same
[53:24.440 --> 53:36.400]  eyes or close to it every day the crew says Alex it's unbelievable it's all
[53:36.400 --> 53:42.440]  confirmed and brings me more news just confirming our worst fears it's it's it's
[53:42.440 --> 53:48.880]  to intellectually know this is one thing but this is so sink your teeth into it
[53:48.880 --> 54:00.000]  this is so real we're alive on a gorgeous planet hurtling through space with
[54:00.000 --> 54:07.080]  wonders all around us the cell has millions of different things a day
[54:07.080 --> 54:13.560]  going on in it incredibly complex the human eye the fact that we see a sunset
[54:13.560 --> 54:18.640]  and beauty and can recognize it and resonate with it the fact that all
[54:18.640 --> 54:24.600]  around us are wonders I can't believe how innocent and good and loving my
[54:24.600 --> 54:28.680]  children are I can't believe how good other people are I can't believe how
[54:28.680 --> 54:33.200]  good their children are I can't believe how much good there is in the world it's
[54:33.200 --> 54:42.720]  amazing but the sad part is good is so humble that until it gets in a really
[54:42.720 --> 54:47.960]  bad situation it doesn't stand up and the globalists know that they know we're
[54:47.960 --> 54:52.200]  going to stand up to them and we know we already are we are already standing up
[54:52.200 --> 54:56.800]  to them but they know we're really going to step up to the plate and so they
[54:56.800 --> 55:03.720]  call it the final revolution against humanity the the dictatorship over
[55:03.720 --> 55:07.080]  humanity and they want to overthrow what it is to be human itself the
[55:07.080 --> 55:11.640]  globalists believe this ultimate tyranny will allow them to mass call the
[55:11.640 --> 55:14.360]  majority of us and that they are then going to have access to the life
[55:14.360 --> 55:17.640]  extension technologies but they can already make a human live double long
[55:17.640 --> 55:21.280]  that's admitted they can make rats live three times as long and that's just in
[55:21.280 --> 55:26.600]  2012 they don't want you to have access to that they don't want to industrialize
[55:26.600 --> 55:29.720]  the third world and educate them and empower them and then they would actually
[55:29.720 --> 55:33.800]  have only 1.3 children like we do that would fix the population problem even
[55:33.800 --> 55:37.560]  if you believe that that's what's even sick about it they're doing all this
[55:37.560 --> 55:42.160]  horrible stuff and their mid-level servants of the eugenics army there's
[55:42.160 --> 55:45.680]  millions of them will say yeah okay so what we're killing third-world people so
[55:45.680 --> 55:48.280]  what they're jacking the food in the water I'm like they're doing it to you
[55:48.280 --> 55:54.840]  too plus they're not even actually trying to build up the third world it's all
[55:54.840 --> 55:58.800]  these yuppies and hippies though you know they'll say to you these fake hippies
[55:58.800 --> 56:01.440]  these trendy hippies they'll say oh yeah we're gonna make everybody be on the
[56:01.440 --> 56:04.840]  buses and the trains and we're gonna shut down society and bankrupt the free
[56:04.840 --> 56:10.440]  market and then the highways will be wide open for us to drive on them that's
[56:10.440 --> 56:14.520]  how they talk I was talking to a friend the other day and he brought up people
[56:14.520 --> 56:18.600]  he knows they're like that and that's their idea they think that because they've
[56:18.600 --> 56:23.400]  bought into this evil system that somehow that gives them power I've had
[56:23.400 --> 56:27.320]  military officers and others and I've had rich people as well very wealthy
[56:27.320 --> 56:31.080]  people say okay Alex 9-11 probably is an inside job what are you gonna do about
[56:31.080 --> 56:35.040]  it that's how stuff gets done you know the elite knows what they've got to do
[56:35.040 --> 56:40.000]  the Muslims are a problem they're gonna end up taking over so so what that's the
[56:40.000 --> 56:43.440]  hard decisions you make and I'm like are you really gonna blow up the little
[56:43.440 --> 56:47.160]  kids that were visiting their parents that day are you know okay you admit
[56:47.160 --> 56:50.760]  eugenics is going on you think there's too many black people and that they're
[56:50.760 --> 56:54.000]  racist enough to get here whatever you know that's your idea are you gonna line
[56:54.000 --> 56:58.080]  up those little black kids and shoot them in the head as much all the new
[56:58.080 --> 57:01.200]  black Panther Party saying kill even the white babies because they're the devil
[57:01.200 --> 57:07.000]  are you really gonna kill that white baby you know the people that are always
[57:07.000 --> 57:11.040]  pushing this stuff I'll guarantee you couldn't fight their way out of a wet
[57:11.040 --> 57:18.720]  paper bag people to think it's funny that for 200 years they bring in liquor
[57:18.720 --> 57:22.040]  to the Indians to get them drunk and control them just like they bring drugs
[57:22.040 --> 57:26.400]  into the inner cities to control people you think that's cute you think it's
[57:26.400 --> 57:33.800]  funny all that stuff blows back on you all of it blows back on everybody alright
[57:33.800 --> 57:38.440]  I'm gonna come back and get into the whole grease meltdown we've got our

[58:53.840 --> 58:58.160]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[58:58.160 --> 59:02.360]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[59:02.360 --> 59:06.400]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[59:06.400 --> 59:10.280]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[59:10.280 --> 59:14.560]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[59:14.560 --> 59:18.720]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[59:18.720 --> 59:23.000]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[59:23.000 --> 59:26.720]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[59:26.720 --> 59:30.920]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[59:30.920 --> 59:34.280]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution

[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:37.520]  Alex Jones dr. Paul Craig Roberts former Wall Street Journal editor at a
[01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:43.360]  policy department of the Treasury is going to be joining us coming up in the
[01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:50.360]  next segment and I've got the headlines here in front of me it was 894
[01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:57.680]  million euros yesterday MSNBC reports now it's over a billion today Greeks rush
[01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:02.400]  to the banks lines form at ATMs nearly 1 billion withdrawn in past week it's
[01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:06.520]  even more than that now that's all up it in full wars calm the bank run in
[01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:10.960]  Greece will soon be followed by bank runs and other European nations that came
[01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:17.480]  out yesterday and now it's been confirmed Italy's bank shaken as economic
[01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:23.560]  slump deepens it's beginning there as well Merkel and Haland spell out Greek
[01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:27.720]  fear the answer is just give more money to the bankers who created the
[01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:32.800]  derivatives and robbed everyone and shipped the jobs out of the country got
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:36.240]  to love how we they paid billions of dollars to ship the Cadillac and Volt
[01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:40.520]  factories to China man I tell you got some traders run in this country we're
[01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:44.600]  not traders they got investments with the Chycoms why not leave why not I mean
[01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:46.840]  the public will pay for it I mean there's nothing American people don't
[01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:52.560]  like there they are launching the drones everywhere judge Andrew Napolitano says
[01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:56.040]  first Patriot to shoot down a government spider will be a hero that's coming up
[01:01:56.040 --> 01:02:00.360]  ever Dr. Roberts leaves us in about 30 minutes here's another headline Greece
[01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:06.800]  faces stark election choice in or out of the euro our Bilderberg source and yes
[01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:10.040]  we were able to get the code name the palm tree conference nobody's ever done
[01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:15.440]  that gotten the code name oh yes they're really freaked out we've confirmed
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:19.000]  that they're worried about too fast of an implosion of the euro that they
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.680]  wanted to implode it into a super European Union and claim that they were
[01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:26.320]  the saviors but they're worried that too fast of an implosion that the Greeks
[01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:31.400]  will exit devalue jump back on their feet say no to the derivatives debt call
[01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:36.160]  the bluff the bankers like Iceland did and have a rebound and then they won't
[01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:39.880]  be able to implode country after country poses saviors bring in fascism
[01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:46.840]  corporate crony monopoly man garbage oh yes I don't know I just have one I have
[01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:54.960]  two sources inside Bilderberg now boy you better believe my phones are tapped
[01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:59.960]  oh I'm told they are hopping mad and you know we had that whistleblower on
[01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:04.880]  yesterday the contractor about how they're training the Merck groups by name
[01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:09.800]  shifting from fighting Arabs to the American people and they're really
[01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:14.440]  upset that we got the secret document about the reeducation camps for the
[01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:19.440]  American people that the government as the army admitted is now real of course
[01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:26.520]  it was real what do you think we got the document from the Easter Bunny just
[01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:30.720]  like people couldn't believe the Mayak and Homeland Security reports that we
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:34.160]  got where they said veterans gun owners Ron Paul supporters get us out of the
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:38.320]  you enters libertarians are the number one threat and terrorist remember that
[01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:42.520]  was four years ago now and people couldn't believe it and now it's all
[01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:46.680]  over the news they say the new threat is homegrown people and the training
[01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:51.760]  manuals it's a guy with a beard and in a John Deere hat literally in the
[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:57.000]  manuals that look like Hank Williams Jr. you're the enemy you're the bad guys
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:02.240]  because you don't want to be run by Goldman Sachs what's the Economist
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:09.880]  magazine brag about they say the US has been captured by Goldman Sachs they say
[01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:14.480]  Europe's been captured they say Goldman Sachs coup over Europe oh aren't we
[01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:17.320]  lucky we've got technocrats who engineered all this but they don't
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:24.760]  mention that in charge but mostly experts we talked to in my own bearing on
[01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:30.080]  this own dead reckoning the estimation and from reading what they're saying and
[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:34.240]  what they're doing is they've been so good at robbing and stealing and
[01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:38.520]  selling out and profiteering and scalping and gutting that they're not
[01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:43.440]  gonna be able to control this it is out of control in fact the leaks we get
[01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:46.280]  and what they publicly say at Davos is that they know it's out of control and
[01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:49.120]  they know they're gonna get in trouble that's why Goldman Sachs people are
[01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:54.040]  all getting bodyguards and arming themselves Bloomberg reported well no
[01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:57.440]  amount of mercenaries will keep you from being brought to justice you're not

[01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:19.520]  live Wednesday edition worldwide transmission thank you for joining us
[01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:25.320]  coming up in 30 minutes of the next hour we're going to have Congressman Walter
[01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:30.080]  Jones who's introduced the legislation to impeach Obama if he launches new wars
[01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:34.240]  without congressional approval it's starting to get some co-sponsors like
[01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:39.040]  Ron Paul and others we're going to get an update from him and more now we're
[01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:43.280]  joined for the next 30 minutes by Dr. Paul Craig Roberts former editor and
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:46.720]  columnist for the Wall Street Journal columnist for Business Week script
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:51.520]  showered news service father of Reaganomics head of policy under Ronald
[01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:55.840]  Reagan of the Department of Treasury best-selling author listed as who's who
[01:08:55.840 --> 01:09:02.920]  in America and he joins us now he's a top economist and he has been breaking down
[01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:08.880]  here on the air the fact that this will only implode the question is when that
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:13.920]  that we're deindustrialized there can be no real recovery and that you know
[01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:18.920]  Europe's melting down the US is melting down now this has been done and you can
[01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:22.440]  either say it's by design or not the point is people running things are the
[01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:25.480]  ones that literally engineered it I mean the exact same crew going back to
[01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:32.360]  Clinton and others and so now there's over a billion as of today in the last
[01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:39.200]  week lines bank runs in Greece spreading to Italy I went over those
[01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:43.760]  headlines the last segment they're all up at info wars.com I wanted to get Dr.
[01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:47.160]  Roberts on about this but then in the second half the interview the police
[01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:54.040]  state the reeducation camp documents the NDA just the insanity of what we're
[01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:57.920]  witnessing what does the ruling class think they're going to do I mean totally
[01:09:57.920 --> 01:10:03.040]  wreck the country as if that's going to give them security this is madness that's
[01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:09.360]  going on so Dr. Roberts joins us and will also give you his websites got a
[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:13.080]  pen and paper ready for that Dr. Roberts so what do you make of what's
[01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:19.320]  happening with the euro right now? I think what's happening in Greece is the
[01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:27.280]  population expects Greece to be kicked out of the EU or to pull out one or the
[01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:35.480]  other and when that happens it means the Greek currency will be devalued it'll
[01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:41.200]  come back into existence but it'll be devalued and so it means the euro value
[01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:48.840]  of the new currency will be a fraction of the value of the current euros that
[01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:56.800]  they hold so they're trying to get those euros now so that they don't lose their
[01:10:56.800 --> 01:11:02.480]  money to devaluation I think that's what that is about I don't think they're
[01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:09.320]  afraid of bank failure or the bank closing the doors they expect that if
[01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:20.000]  Greece exits the EU then it has to exit the euro and when it does that the new
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:27.720]  Greek currency will not be worth they won't get an exchange rate that reflects
[01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:32.080]  their value of their current holding so they're trying to get the stronger money
[01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:40.160]  now or while they can I think that's what's going on there I wouldn't expect
[01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:47.120]  that to spread to other countries unless they are also fear being ejected from
[01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:55.120]  the EU and losing the euro as their domestic currency that doesn't mean
[01:11:55.120 --> 01:12:01.040]  they're not a lot of problems in in Europe and it doesn't mean that they
[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:08.000]  have a handle on a fix doc a lot of the experts we have on pretty much agree
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:14.160]  that whether it's Max Kaiser Bob Chapman countless others you know people
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:20.640]  like Faber that that if the euro starts unraveling which now even Bloomberg and
[01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:24.520]  others are saying could happen that it's obviously they're gonna have
[01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:31.000]  repercussions here and they say within a few months it's going to you really show
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:35.720]  the fact that the dollar has been devalued and and and that that's going
[01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:39.120]  to accelerate I mean what do you expect to see because you always make the point
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:43.360]  that because of deindustrialization especially here in the US we're
[01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:47.680]  technically even worse off than Europe so why are we seeing this in Europe
[01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:55.160]  first I think because of the sovereign debt problem and because of the fact
[01:12:55.160 --> 01:13:02.400]  that Europe does not have a central bank that can create credit for the
[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:09.560]  governments you know the the European Central Bank is prohibited by its
[01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:14.960]  charter and by the agreement that set it up between the countries from purchasing
[01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:23.920]  the sovereign debt of the member states now it's starting to do that in his
[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:33.640]  various schemes to keep grease afloat but it can't just simply do like the Fed
[01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:40.040]  and just monetize whatever debt needs to be issued you see the British can do
[01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:45.800]  that because they have their own central bank and the bank can extend
[01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:50.640]  unlimited credit to the government it can simply monetize an unlimited amount
[01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:53.440]  of debt and that's what the Federal Reserve has been doing that's what
[01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:58.320]  quantitative easing one is about quantitative easing two and in my opinion
[01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:01.960]  it's what they're still doing is how they keep the interest rates at zero or
[01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:08.200]  near zero they simply purchase all the debt that would otherwise raise the
[01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:13.440]  interest rates well in Europe they can't do that the individual countries don't
[01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:18.200]  have central banks that can serve as credit to the government and the
[01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:24.160]  European Central Bank is restrained by charter from from doing that and they
[01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:29.920]  haven't loosened those handcuffs yet wasn't it the Germans that demanded at
[01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:34.000]  the offset of the or the onset of the euro that that be done because of their
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:39.640]  Weimar Republic experience with super hyperinflation and the wheelbarrows to
[01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:46.640]  buy a loaf of bread that's right if this was imposed by Germans as a condition
[01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:51.920]  for the EU they didn't want to lose their own currency of which they had
[01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:57.280]  control and a great deal of fiscal or monetary and we'll put it discipline and
[01:14:57.280 --> 01:15:01.680]  they knew that some of the other countries are in fact most almost all
[01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:07.480]  the other countries lack that discipline and so that was the only terms on which
[01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:12.920]  they agreed to become part of Europe but if Greece leaves doesn't that do it
[01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:16.680]  anyway so what's gonna happen I mean the word is Greece is gonna end up leaving
[01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:22.440]  the euro or do you disagree with that I don't know whether that's the case or
[01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:29.520]  not you have to keep in mind Alex that it's in the interest of Wall Street and
[01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:34.920]  the investment banks and the hedge funds to create hysteria about this because
[01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:38.920]  they make huge some speculating off the hysteria that that they get the
[01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:42.160]  financial press to create and they have the inside knowledge on where it's gonna
[01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:47.400]  go well they may or may not but they can at least make money off of hysteria and
[01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:52.720]  also it's in Washington's interest because if the euro is in trouble it
[01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:57.160]  takes pressure off the dollar it strengthens the dollar because people say
[01:15:57.160 --> 01:16:00.200]  oh well we better get into the dollar we don't know what's gonna happen to the
[01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:05.880]  euro and and when they go into the dollar this also depresses gold and silver
[01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:11.120]  prices which is also in Washington's interest that also takes pressure off the
[01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:16.520]  dollar sure it's like you said and as I've said from for many years the
[01:16:16.520 --> 01:16:22.160]  dollar is even in worse shape but it's not in focus what's in focus is the
[01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:32.720]  euro and so this helps Washington and so Washington keeps this height going as
[01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:41.120]  well so but between between the interest of the investment banks and hedge funds
[01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:46.520]  and speculating against sovereign debt and against the euro and between
[01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:52.840]  Washington's interest and and causing having the euro in trouble because it
[01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:58.280]  helps the dollar you get a lot of spin and hype and so you can't know whether
[01:16:58.280 --> 01:17:03.800]  Greece is going to leave or not it will really be a political decision it'll be
[01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:09.640]  made by Germany and France primarily and they will decide whether or not they
[01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:17.800]  want to reform the EU and get rid of some of the weaker elements that result in
[01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:23.400]  these kinds of problems or whether they want to pay the cost of keeping Greece
[01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:27.880]  in I don't think that decision has been made sure now that's why Merkel and the
[01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:32.520]  new French president Hollande met yesterday and most of that they're
[01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:36.080]  keeping under wraps what they're planning to do but let's expand on
[01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:39.880]  something what do you make of Jamie Diamond running around and just saying
[01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:43.760]  oh two billion loss that's just an accounting procedure what do you make
[01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:49.400]  of the overall financial structure what's the prognosis right now on the
[01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:56.400]  ongoing rotting of the world financial system you know I don't think the
[01:17:56.400 --> 01:18:03.440]  United States financial system any longer performs a useful social function I
[01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:10.160]  think it's just a deadweight cost to society because all the American
[01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:17.600]  financial system does is produce a massive financial crisis that causes a
[01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:24.520]  huge expansion of debt and money to keep their balance sheets afloat and this
[01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:30.800]  crisis was exported to Europe and is part of the trouble there so I just
[01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:37.920]  don't see that there's any reason to continue to tolerate the private
[01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:45.040]  American financial system it's become a great threat to the economic future of
[01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:51.760]  the country before it performs no useful social function it creates fraudulent
[01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:59.960]  assets the participants in these markets currently have no integrity you see
[01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:05.320]  them actually doing things that in past decades they would have been arrested
[01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:11.880]  and imprisoned for so what is their function it they've taken the financial
[01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:18.640]  system and turned it into a gambling casino and even they can't win that's
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:24.800]  why you see JP Morgan losing two billion dollars they don't even know what
[01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:33.000]  they're doing and the whole thing just be closed down and reformed and also the
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:39.320]  concentration is far too extensive now the size of these banks that's right
[01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:44.000]  they're monopolies or or duopoly's oligopoly's lecturing us about the free
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:48.480]  market all day and they've done all this through government licensure allowing
[01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:51.720]  them to do this shutting down their competition stay there I want to finish
[01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:56.040]  up on that point and get into the police state you've been writing a lot about
[01:19:56.040 --> 01:20:02.720]  at Paul Craig Roberts dot org I'm Alex Jones this year about one in every 50

[01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:33.240]  the system is broken and Dr. Roberts before I went to break former I had a
[01:24:33.240 --> 01:24:36.920]  policy to the Department of the Treasury Wall Street Journal editor formerly
[01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:41.200]  I'm best-selling author again Paul Craig Roberts org I'm Alex Jones of info
[01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:45.720]  wars.com but you were bringing up the lawlessness and there's so many
[01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:49.400]  examples again Obama launching wars Congress is you got to come to us that's
[01:24:49.400 --> 01:24:53.880]  law I mean it's treason if you don't he just says eh I'll do what I want joint
[01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:59.480]  chiefs say the same thing we've got MF global billions disappear hundreds of
[01:24:59.480 --> 01:25:04.160]  millions still not paid back he gets caught lying the head of the CME group
[01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:08.880]  Duffy won't lie for him it's confirmed that Corzine lied doesn't get in
[01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:13.920]  trouble I mean this is reaching new levels what does this signify that they
[01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:18.240]  can just do anything why are they doing this you worked inside the government I
[01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:25.560]  mean you know some of these people Dr. Roberts what is happening well Alex I
[01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:35.880]  don't think that it's a plan that is unfolding by the elites as you said I
[01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:40.080]  know many of the elites they're not as smart as I am or as you are or as many
[01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:46.880]  of your listeners are and they may have some kind of plan but it'll have far
[01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:53.640]  more unintended unexpected consequences than they can imagine and so they won't
[01:25:53.640 --> 01:26:00.920]  they won't be in control and they'll panic and what will happen will will be
[01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:06.000]  something totally different from any plan that that they might have and that's
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:11.320]  what history shows with the Germans the Romans the Russians these guys are
[01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:15.880]  megalomaniacs so where do you see it going well I think what's happening is
[01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:22.720]  accountability is leaving the elites it left the government you know it left the
[01:26:22.720 --> 01:26:27.120]  government a long time ago you know Abraham Lincoln got rid of
[01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:34.440]  accountability you know he even banned exiled a member of Congress but 300
[01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:41.520]  newspaper editors in prison you know the assault on government
[01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:48.320]  accountability is old and it's gotten worse because of the war on terror
[01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:55.920]  because people so many people now simply assume that the government needs to be
[01:26:55.920 --> 01:27:01.600]  able to do extra legal things extra judicial things in order to deal with
[01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:08.160]  terrorists and as I have said so often we are these terrorists how come they
[01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:12.040]  don't ever do anything how come the only terrorist plots are the ones that the
[01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:18.960]  FBI dreams up in in orchestrates if there were terrorists I come so many
[01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:26.640]  terrorist enemies they walk around safe with no attempt on their lives so but
[01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:33.600]  it's it's propaganda that works and so people say oh well we can't make the
[01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:37.480]  government to behave legally and constitutionally because we have this
[01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:41.800]  terrorist threat they have to deal with that that's part of it the other part is
[01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:49.560]  the elites themselves the private sector elites they have they they have
[01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:54.960]  benefited from them for the last 10 20 years from the sort of free market
[01:27:54.960 --> 01:28:01.560]  utopia that perfect social perfection is the absence of regulation and absence
[01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:08.000]  of regulation means the absence of accountability there's no so if you're
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:12.960]  not accountable then you behave as if you're not accountable it changes the
[01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:18.640]  behavior and attitude and outlook of the elites themselves so I think those are
[01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:24.640]  part of the explanation of what is going on very well said let me ask you this
[01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:28.520]  question we are seeing and I've got contractors I've confirmed it but it's
[01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:33.120]  also in the news they're flipping from fighting foreign Muslims to good old
[01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:36.920]  boys conservatives libertarians people that know what's going on and this is
[01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:39.960]  actually waking the police and military up man I've been having them on the show
[01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:45.400]  but why is the elite getting their domestic control system really ready
[01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:50.960]  right now are they concerned about a collapse I don't know I doubt it I think
[01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:56.680]  they have too much hubris I don't you know I'm not really on good terms with
[01:28:56.680 --> 01:29:05.280]  them anymore and so I don't they don't confide in me but I doubt that it's that
[01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:11.320]  I think what it is is that it's the it's impetus from the bureaucracy itself I
[01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:17.200]  mean Homeland Security is what an 80 billion dollar institution this is huge
[01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:24.000]  and since there aren't any real terrorists to justify their existence
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:27.920]  they've never called a single one have they no they're just gonna make us that
[01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:32.400]  because they can expand their mission now well I think it's the preserved the
[01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:37.600]  mission that you know the the head of Homeland Security she said this a year
[01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:43.800]  or two ago that they were shifting their focus from terrorists to domestic
[01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:54.640]  extremist stay there doctor we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones

[01:33:04.840 --> 01:33:11.480]  altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of
[01:33:11.480 --> 01:33:19.960]  man Thomas Jefferson it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network alright Dr.
[01:33:19.960 --> 01:33:23.960]  Roberts is with us another 10 minutes or so and then I'm going to open the phones
[01:33:23.960 --> 01:33:28.960]  up on any of the news I've covered until the end of the hour and then we've got
[01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:33.560]  congressman Jones joining us representative Walter Jones you don't
[01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:39.360]  want to miss that information going back to Dr. Roberts who studied history
[01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:42.400]  because I've read several of his books he knows what he's talking about and also
[01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:47.560]  obviously studied the economy as a top economist that elites act the same
[01:33:47.560 --> 01:33:52.000]  throughout history just because they've got NSA run Google and they've got
[01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:56.120]  high-powered atomic weapons and hydrogen bombs doesn't mean they're not still the
[01:33:56.120 --> 01:34:00.840]  same people and they just think they can get away with all these things they're
[01:34:00.840 --> 01:34:05.160]  doing and the truth is they've made themselves unaccountable so now they're
[01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:09.880]  unaccountable to even sanity and just like every other out-of-control elite
[01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:14.800]  does this in every culture they are like Kublai Khan trying to invade Japan or
[01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:19.520]  Hitler or Napoleon going into Russia they are biting off more than they can
[01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:23.920]  chew because you can be the toughest guy around but you mess with the wrong guy
[01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:27.400]  on the wrong day they're gonna or you mess with them when they got their kids
[01:34:27.400 --> 01:34:30.720]  with them or something you're not gonna be able to stop them so so people
[01:34:30.720 --> 01:34:34.080]  always think they're bulletproof and invincible especially these people that
[01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:38.680]  crave power and and domination they got a screw loose they're able to get the
[01:34:38.680 --> 01:34:42.720]  power because they'll cheat and steal but then once they get it they end up
[01:34:42.720 --> 01:34:46.840]  destroying themselves and a bunch of us in the process so dr. Roberts is making
[01:34:46.840 --> 01:34:51.480]  the key point here the bureaucracy and the military industrial complex that
[01:34:51.480 --> 01:34:56.280]  Eisenhower warned us about is eating our country and the rest of the world and
[01:34:56.280 --> 01:34:59.560]  so you've got the bureaucracy you've got the elites that think it's going to
[01:34:59.560 --> 01:35:04.640]  protect them but just 101 in every culture even in modern times in Africa
[01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:09.440]  Latin America Asia Eastern Europe you always build a secret police network it
[01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:13.200]  always starts spying on the parliament or the government it always starts
[01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:17.160]  killing people and abusing and a lot of times oh here's the new president you
[01:35:17.160 --> 01:35:22.120]  know general whoever six months later he gets overthrown this is the last
[01:35:22.120 --> 01:35:28.240]  system if I was an elite even if I was evil and corrupt and sadistic and on a
[01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:32.800]  power trip the last system I would want dr. Roberts is what they're putting in
[01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:36.920]  the I mean can you elaborate on that I think that's where you're going with
[01:35:36.920 --> 01:35:39.680]  this and I think that's why you make the point that you don't think the elite
[01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:42.520]  are driving all of this
[01:35:42.520 --> 01:35:49.080]  unintended consequences of the elite as well as some of the intended ones you
[01:35:49.080 --> 01:35:54.200]  see they're not just eating the country and they're eating the Constitution so
[01:35:54.200 --> 01:36:01.080]  when you eat the Constitution you don't have any protection either you may
[01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:06.360]  remember the the play the man for all seasons when Sir Thomas Moore
[01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:10.400]  the Chancellor of England he says so you want me to cut down the law so we can
[01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:17.920]  more easily chase after devils and what will we do when the laws cut down and
[01:36:17.920 --> 01:36:24.560]  the devil turns on us yes so it's what the Bolsheviks found out that's what
[01:36:24.560 --> 01:36:29.920]  the Politburo found out they were powerless in the face of Stalin there
[01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:36.160]  was no longer any law there was only the decision of the general secretary of the
[01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:43.840]  Congress Party so this is the elites are preparing the on grave you're right but
[01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:51.520]  come back to the question of the shift from focus on terrorism to domestic
[01:36:51.520 --> 01:36:57.040]  extremists this is also part of the elite agenda because who are the
[01:36:57.040 --> 01:37:02.960]  domestic extremists for example this environmentalist who get in the way of
[01:37:02.960 --> 01:37:09.440]  fracking operations blowing up mountains to get coal of putting mining
[01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:17.280]  ventures next to national monuments and parks of polluting waters and the Gulf
[01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:25.160]  of Mexico these people are inconvenient for powerful mining timber groups you
[01:37:25.160 --> 01:37:33.960]  have other people who are in opposition to Monsanto Monsanto's genetically
[01:37:33.960 --> 01:37:42.240]  modified seeds they're in the way you have profits you you have animal rights
[01:37:42.240 --> 01:37:47.960]  people who say animals or living creatures they shouldn't be treated in
[01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:54.040]  inhumane ways in these experiments where you do all these testing and and they're
[01:37:54.040 --> 01:37:59.040]  in the way of the drug companies the testing companies so all these kinds of
[01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:03.960]  people are in the way in fact soon related you and I will be in the way
[01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:11.240]  because we we don't speak the line you don't speak the line you're in the way
[01:38:11.240 --> 01:38:18.880]  so they they can use terrorism that came out of 9-11 they can use the fear of
[01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:27.840]  that to expand it in to attack on all critics and that's what I think homeland
[01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:33.480]  security is becoming and you see why else is homeland security stopping
[01:38:33.480 --> 01:38:38.680]  traffic on interstates are going to bus stations and train stations there have
[01:38:38.680 --> 01:38:46.640]  been no incidents not even staged FBI it's a total raw exercise of power to
[01:38:46.640 --> 01:38:52.120]  set the precedent it's getting us used to it accepting of it and you have to
[01:38:52.120 --> 01:38:57.480]  understand that the young they don't even know the old system they only know
[01:38:57.480 --> 01:39:03.480]  what the experience now so to them it's just normal if you get you know you just
[01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:07.640]  got your driver's license and you've not been driving you're driving along
[01:39:07.640 --> 01:39:12.080]  interstate everything stopped and they're inspecting you well it's all you
[01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:17.080]  know you grew up with it so you don't know it's a police state it's just what
[01:39:17.080 --> 01:39:24.200]  you know you're not 40 50 years old you don't remember when something like this
[01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:30.320]  would have been inconceivable so I think that's what's happening to us and
[01:39:30.320 --> 01:39:35.840]  another thing that's happening is you see I think the war on terror is wearing
[01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:40.760]  out for them it's been very profitable but they don't win the war you see when
[01:39:40.760 --> 01:39:45.680]  if you're a superpower and you have to be in Iraq for eight years and the only
[01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:51.440]  way you can win is to put the insurgents on the US military payroll and pay them
[01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:56.440]  to stop fighting and if you're in Afghanistan for 11 years and you can't
[01:39:56.440 --> 01:40:02.520]  defeat a few thousand Taliban armed with AK-47 then your whole reputation is a
[01:40:02.520 --> 01:40:07.280]  superpower starts evaporating so they've now announced they've beaten Al Qaeda
[01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:13.360]  they're using Al Qaeda in Syria and also in places like Libya just admitting it
[01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:17.480]  oh this is the good Al Qaeda that's why we stick around yeah yeah what they got
[01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:22.320]  to have a new enemy and so it's gonna be China oh yes and the American people
[01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:25.440]  though if we're getting out of line because they're saying we've won the
[01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:30.840]  war against Al Qaeda and as you said now let's have a war with China break that
[01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:35.440]  down well I don't want a real war they want a cold war see the most profitable
[01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:40.280]  conflict was the cold war with the Soviets because everybody knew they
[01:40:40.280 --> 01:40:45.000]  weren't gonna fight it because there wouldn't be anything left but the
[01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:51.640]  Soviet threat was good for four or five decades of unlimited military spending
[01:40:51.640 --> 01:41:00.320]  of unlimited CIA power and and the war with the hot war in the Middle East it's
[01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:04.760]  not working for them it hurts the reputation to demoralize us the troops
[01:41:04.760 --> 01:41:09.820]  look the suicides exceed the battle casualties so they got to have a new
[01:41:09.820 --> 01:41:14.640]  cold war and the only real person they can pick on now is China and that's why
[01:41:14.640 --> 01:41:20.800]  we had the naval exercises with Philippines a week or so ago that's why
[01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:24.800]  we're building a new naval base in South Korea on Island that's why we're
[01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:30.600]  sending Marines into Asia and Australia that's why Hillary Clinton declared the
[01:41:30.600 --> 01:41:35.440]  South China Sea to be an area of American national interest I'm sure the
[01:41:35.440 --> 01:41:39.080]  Chinese president said two months ago he said prepare for war the United States
[01:41:39.080 --> 01:41:43.520]  they're encircling us but separately then they pay with a bailout to move the
[01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:48.080]  Cadillac and vault factories over there and separately let them buy up our
[01:41:48.080 --> 01:41:53.120]  infrastructure I mean is that part of a double game well well I think it's two
[01:41:53.120 --> 01:42:00.040]  different interests see they the choice of them as an enemy is new the choice of
[01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:07.160]  them as a low-cost source of production is as 10 20 years old and that benefits
[01:42:07.160 --> 01:42:14.080]  manufacturers but the military security industry needs an enemy so there is a
[01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:19.480]  conflict there between two powerful interest groups in the United States but
[01:42:19.480 --> 01:42:23.800]  they'll keep it a cold war they don't really want a hot war with China I mean
[01:42:23.800 --> 01:42:29.160]  that's not what they want they want a long-term threat that they can continue
[01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:35.120]  to spend unlimited money on airplanes like the F2 to which they pilots are
[01:42:35.120 --> 01:42:42.160]  afraid to fly and which have now been grounded they don't care they don't want
[01:42:42.160 --> 01:42:49.760]  a real war they want a long-term cold war because they can forever height the
[01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:53.920]  Chinese threat is to why they got to have a bigger defense budget and more
[01:42:53.920 --> 01:42:59.680]  power so I think that's where it's moving and that's why they're they're kind
[01:42:59.680 --> 01:43:04.240]  of shifting the emphasis now the problem with them getting away from the
[01:43:04.240 --> 01:43:09.280]  Middle East is Israel because Israel still determined that they attack Syria
[01:43:09.280 --> 01:43:17.920]  and Iran and if Israel succeeds and having us attack Syria and Iran then we
[01:43:17.920 --> 01:43:23.480]  may never get out of the Middle East or we may come heads-to-heads with China
[01:43:23.480 --> 01:43:29.600]  and Russia in a hot type of content basically you and I and others Ron Paul
[01:43:29.600 --> 01:43:35.120]  we're in the way of their madness and the grave the ruling class is trying to
[01:43:35.120 --> 01:43:38.200]  dig for themselves and as you point out they have Bilderberg meetings and things
[01:43:38.200 --> 01:43:42.080]  that come up with general plans and argue with each other but I see it
[01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:45.560]  everywhere where they're different special interests sometimes even
[01:43:45.560 --> 01:43:49.840]  different divisions of the same big companies are at odds with each other
[01:43:49.840 --> 01:43:54.320]  it really is just a bunch of people running in all directions stealing
[01:43:54.320 --> 01:43:58.920]  everything they can right and also you see they now have the country at odds with
[01:43:58.920 --> 01:44:04.960]  itself there's so much hatred of Americans against Americans and
[01:44:04.960 --> 01:44:10.320]  Democrats and Republicans and right-wing and left-wing and Christians on this
[01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:17.240]  and and non-Christians on I mean it's just an endless so we're we're a split
[01:44:17.240 --> 01:44:22.720]  among ourselves as the Romans were in their last years and so a country that
[01:44:22.720 --> 01:44:28.680]  internally split and also now increasingly fearful of their own
[01:44:28.680 --> 01:44:33.480]  government is not a very strong country to be taking on China
[01:44:33.480 --> 01:44:43.760]  Russia so I think they're headed for a lot of surprises and I don't know when
[01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:48.760]  the dollar goes or when the power of the United States collapses I don't know
[01:44:48.760 --> 01:44:55.640]  what is going to happen but nothing that they're doing really furthers our
[01:44:55.640 --> 01:45:01.240]  future success it's all at the expense of our future success that's the key what
[01:45:01.240 --> 01:45:04.720]  the globalist with those group of criminals are doing is wrecking the
[01:45:04.720 --> 01:45:08.920]  United States there's no doubt that their policies are cyanide to this
[01:45:08.920 --> 01:45:13.200]  Republic in closing Dr. Roberts and of course your great new website will spin
[01:45:13.200 --> 01:45:16.920]  out six months or so really nice a lot of great info there Paul Greg Roberts
[01:45:16.920 --> 01:45:20.920]  got a word and we carry your fine articles every other day when you write
[01:45:20.920 --> 01:45:25.520]  them a final point I think it's positive though that we're seeing two three four
[01:45:25.520 --> 01:45:29.200]  five million guns sold a month and they have questionnaires and they say I fear
[01:45:29.200 --> 01:45:32.520]  the government I don't trust them I don't believe in them anymore yeah I mean
[01:45:32.520 --> 01:45:37.040]  in a way as long as people know that's the hijack government and we offer a
[01:45:37.040 --> 01:45:40.880]  good solution I think that really shows that people have finally woken up
[01:45:40.880 --> 01:45:45.200]  everybody I talked to including police military you name it they say that most
[01:45:45.200 --> 01:45:48.840]  people they know are finally starting to wake up do they know as much as you do
[01:45:48.840 --> 01:45:53.760]  or others no but they're beginning the process of awakening your comments on
[01:45:53.760 --> 01:46:02.360]  the gun sales well you know I agree with what you said however I think the armed
[01:46:02.360 --> 01:46:07.280]  population is inconsistent with the police state so I don't know how long
[01:46:07.280 --> 01:46:12.200]  the police state and Homeland Security are going to tolerate an armed
[01:46:12.200 --> 01:46:19.960]  population I just don't know it's an you know the only protective amendment left
[01:46:19.960 --> 01:46:25.440]  of Constitution is a second amendment all the others are gone so how can you
[01:46:25.440 --> 01:46:32.000]  have the second amendment if you can't have habeas corpus or do process so I
[01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:36.760]  and sir you know history that's what happened in the lead-ups in 1765 at the
[01:46:36.760 --> 01:46:40.920]  1775 was they took all the rights an Englishman had they said hey we're
[01:46:40.920 --> 01:46:45.480]  Englishmen we don't we would have these rights in England are Magna Carta you've
[01:46:45.480 --> 01:46:50.280]  taken it here and the British government the police the paramilitary said
[01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:53.640]  we're coming to take your guns and that's when it started and I think that's
[01:46:53.640 --> 01:46:59.240]  where the day they actually try this is when the Civil War starts well you know
[01:46:59.240 --> 01:47:06.640]  the column we but we're not organized Alex everybody's atomized it at least
[01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:10.520]  when the British came against the colonists there was organization on the
[01:47:10.520 --> 01:47:15.560]  part of the colonists there's none today we're not organized and in the effort
[01:47:15.560 --> 01:47:20.400]  some years ago to have a militia they all fail because they were all infiltrated
[01:47:20.400 --> 01:47:27.160]  by our federal agents and so I just don't know if that's right I mean it's fine
[01:47:27.160 --> 01:47:33.320]  with me if it is and I can be hopeful but people as far as I can tell are not
[01:47:33.320 --> 01:47:42.080]  organized and and a lot of them that are collecting guns are really they still
[01:47:42.080 --> 01:47:46.720]  think there's a Muslim threat and the Muslims are gonna get them or or some
[01:47:46.720 --> 01:47:53.920]  other racial entity or it's not it's not a uniform awareness of where the real
[01:47:53.920 --> 01:47:59.360]  threat is but it is a reservoir that we can fully awaken yeah and I'll tell you
[01:47:59.360 --> 01:48:03.040]  the military they're they're waking up but but I agree with you we need to
[01:48:03.040 --> 01:48:06.920]  really people generally though in a manifest of liberty they know who the
[01:48:06.920 --> 01:48:10.920]  enemy is they know who did this and as the persecution and arrest and
[01:48:10.920 --> 01:48:15.520]  disappearances began that's where they plan to go there will be resistance
[01:48:15.520 --> 01:48:18.800]  because people won't have a choice and the enforcers like Alexander Sultan
[01:48:18.800 --> 01:48:21.680]  Ethan talked about you know what would have happened if when the enforcers went
[01:48:21.680 --> 01:48:25.400]  out the secret police to grab people if folks would have stood up and I think
[01:48:25.400 --> 01:48:29.480]  it's that simple idea of total resistance individually leaderless
[01:48:29.480 --> 01:48:33.760]  resistance can't be stopped and if 1% of 200 million and that's what it's up to
[01:48:33.760 --> 01:48:38.960]  now gun owners resist that's 2 million people and so all someone out yeah I
[01:48:38.960 --> 01:48:46.480]  think the time to be optimistic is when a handful of cops beating up some
[01:48:46.480 --> 01:48:53.080]  hapless person are set upon by the large number of bystanders and then the
[01:48:53.080 --> 01:48:58.680]  cops are beat up or killed instead of the innocent person I think when the
[01:48:58.680 --> 01:49:04.960]  people start responding to the police with force which they could very easily
[01:49:04.960 --> 01:49:09.520]  overcome the police simply because of disparity in numbers when that starts
[01:49:09.520 --> 01:49:13.120]  happening then we can say the people really have woken up and really have
[01:49:13.120 --> 01:49:18.200]  had enough like in Greece because the people were throwing Molotov cocktails
[01:49:18.200 --> 01:49:22.040]  at the police they were trying to kill them and they started they beat them to
[01:49:22.040 --> 01:49:30.040]  that's yeah so I think they haven't been drinking fluoride doc can you imagine
[01:49:30.040 --> 01:49:33.640]  if the government tried to act like this say a hundred years ago what would
[01:49:33.640 --> 01:49:39.040]  have happened they would have been short-lived government yeah yeah we've
[01:49:39.040 --> 01:49:43.280]  been on a steady diet of in the past but usually they put them down like the
[01:49:43.280 --> 01:49:48.440]  whiskey rebellion was put down with the army so you know they they break all
[01:49:48.440 --> 01:49:54.080]  the rules and employ troops against the people when they feel they need to so I
[01:49:54.080 --> 01:50:00.040]  don't know it's it remains to be seen how bad things get I think you got to have
[01:50:00.040 --> 01:50:06.760]  people quite desperate here before they actually take on the government and and
[01:50:06.760 --> 01:50:12.280]  they're not going to get that desperate suddenly it's going to be a drawn-out
[01:50:12.280 --> 01:50:17.760]  process well a lot of police I talked to are actually getting it now and are
[01:50:17.760 --> 01:50:22.000]  criticizing the cases of like people like Thomas Kelly who they tortured to
[01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:26.680]  death for fun and the I've seen in Latin America when the police start
[01:50:26.680 --> 01:50:30.120]  beating somebody up everybody runs in and attacks them but again they haven't
[01:50:30.120 --> 01:50:34.160]  been drinking fluoride eating GMO and you know watching 10 hours of television

[01:54:10.880 --> 01:54:17.240]  Congressman Walter Jones is coming up with the impeachment of Obama right now
[01:54:17.240 --> 01:54:22.240]  let's go to Frank in New York Frank you're on the air welcome good afternoon
[01:54:22.240 --> 01:54:31.160]  Alex a most enjoyable interview with Dr. Robert Alex it's been a it's been a
[01:54:31.160 --> 01:54:34.960]  while since I've spoken to you I guess about a year and a half and I listened
[01:54:34.960 --> 01:54:41.360]  here regularly but you have an amazing group of callers so it's getting more
[01:54:41.360 --> 01:54:45.480]  and more difficult to you know get in touch with you but I wanted to say this
[01:54:45.480 --> 01:54:50.680]  I think now it's time for people to reread the Gulag Archipelago by
[01:54:50.680 --> 01:54:57.040]  Folgenitzen to at least understand what totalitarian oppression is in a
[01:54:57.040 --> 01:55:02.320]  contemporary setting and also I was I'm very concerned about the recent
[01:55:02.320 --> 01:55:08.240]  statements regarding Russia and China specifically Russia taking preemptive
[01:55:08.240 --> 01:55:14.240]  action to remove the threat of the American missile shield in Poland in
[01:55:14.240 --> 01:55:18.120]  the Czech Republic. Oh that's the thing is the rhetoric is going off the chart
[01:55:18.120 --> 01:55:23.800]  to above Cold War levels between China Russia and the United States and you
[01:55:23.800 --> 01:55:27.480]  mentioned authoritarianism a lot of good old boys are like oh that's fine I don't
[01:55:27.480 --> 01:55:31.720]  mind if we have any rights authoritarianism is almost always hellishly
[01:55:31.720 --> 01:55:38.040]  poor I mean they ruin the economy you tyranny is not cute I know Hollywood
[01:55:38.040 --> 01:55:42.040]  makes it look fun but I'll assure you ladies and gentlemen it's not they will
[01:55:42.040 --> 01:55:46.200]  gut this country what are your other points I wanted to say this Alex that
[01:55:46.200 --> 01:55:51.240]  it destroys the spirit and I don't just mean necessarily the soul or religious
[01:55:51.240 --> 01:55:55.880]  spirit but the geist or the spirit or the will within everyone and it's a very
[01:55:55.880 --> 01:56:01.640]  demoralizing experience and the 20th century has taught us that in profound
[01:56:01.640 --> 01:56:05.040]  ways well that's why I say liberty or death because I'm not going to be living
[01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:08.560]  in that world I'm gonna beat these people we're gonna beat them or I'm gonna die
[01:56:08.560 --> 01:56:14.640]  trying liberty or death victory or death I have to say Alex your documentaries
[01:56:14.640 --> 01:56:21.960]  are superb I tried linking up with you in in September September 11th 2006 but
[01:56:21.960 --> 01:56:25.560]  you were quite busy I guess with the police and things in New York but
[01:56:25.560 --> 01:56:30.400]  hopefully at some point we'll get together and I recognize your I recognize
[01:56:30.400 --> 01:56:33.440]  your voice you've called over the years well I got a decade or so thank you
[01:56:33.440 --> 01:56:39.240]  Frank George in Connecticut you're on the air go ahead hi Alex I am wondering
[01:56:39.240 --> 01:56:43.760]  if you could get one of your talented people to make up a sign that we could
[01:56:43.760 --> 01:56:48.280]  use for the university students to get down to build a burger may occupy
[01:56:48.280 --> 01:56:54.240]  build a burger these are the people who voted over taking down our economy and
[01:56:54.240 --> 01:56:58.560]  so in what year I forgot the the original year and maybe some of the other
[01:56:58.560 --> 01:57:03.200]  elements we could put have that up there somehow and then they could download it
[01:57:03.200 --> 01:57:06.600]  and print it out and every now that's a great idea I'm gonna I'm gonna tell my
[01:57:06.600 --> 01:57:09.920]  graphics folks to come up with whatever the standard you know print out sign
[01:57:09.920 --> 01:57:14.800]  sizes graphic or volunteers can do it and we'll post a Builderburg coverage
[01:57:14.800 --> 01:57:18.160]  section ahead of time because it's getting close only a few weeks away now
[01:57:18.160 --> 01:57:21.520]  like a week and a half and we're gonna be there covering Builderburg gonna be
[01:57:21.520 --> 01:57:25.640]  there in person for four days in Chantilly Virginia and yes we need to
[01:57:25.640 --> 01:57:29.480]  get everybody out there with the signs like you know Builderburg's we you know
[01:57:29.480 --> 01:57:34.040]  we're on to you we got your number Builderburg you you know you're the
[01:57:34.040 --> 01:57:38.800]  enemy you're the threat I mean some simple slogan we also need to all call the
[01:57:38.800 --> 01:57:42.280]  prostitute media and let them know that we're fully aware of the fact that they
[01:57:42.280 --> 01:57:47.360]  never cover this event one other thing I was thinking I saw these very cheap
[01:57:47.360 --> 01:57:53.240]  little plant remote control planes like but 20 25 dollars if we could all get
[01:57:53.240 --> 01:57:56.960]  those and fly it at them and maybe get little tiny microphones these micro
[01:57:56.960 --> 01:58:02.080]  microphones and micro video cameras with full so now you're talking let me
[01:58:02.080 --> 01:58:07.520]  stop you I'll just I'll just go ahead and let this out we are looking at it
[01:58:07.520 --> 01:58:12.440]  it's legal and lawful but it's just the fun of it at getting one of those four

[02:01:20.600 --> 02:01:24.920]  help and and more important I want the listeners to your show to pick up the
[02:01:24.920 --> 02:01:30.200]  phone and call them members of Congress and ask the members of Congress to join
[02:01:30.200 --> 02:01:34.560]  in this effort to make sure that Congress meets his constitutional
[02:01:34.560 --> 02:01:40.480]  responsibility and not allow a president a state on their own decision to just
[02:01:40.480 --> 02:01:45.000]  bypass Congress and bomb a country as you made reference to Libya and you were
[02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:50.400]  exactly right this bill right now and and been on your show I was on the
[02:01:50.400 --> 02:01:54.240]  LaRouche show over the weekend we're gonna do as many shows as possible we
[02:01:54.240 --> 02:01:58.840]  need the listeners to pick up the phone and call their member of Congress right
[02:01:58.840 --> 02:02:02.960]  there in the district office whatever state they're in and say we want my I
[02:02:02.960 --> 02:02:08.880]  want my congressman to go on H con resolution 107 and that's what we need
[02:02:08.880 --> 02:02:14.440]  to happen we need a hearing and I we do have the ear of the chairman of the
[02:02:14.440 --> 02:02:18.360]  judiciary committee's names Lamar smear from Texas and we've had a lot of
[02:02:18.360 --> 02:02:22.720]  interest like you and all this from the state of Texas about this constitutional
[02:02:22.720 --> 02:02:28.880]  issue so we would like to get a hearing sometime in July and Alex the way this
[02:02:28.880 --> 02:02:35.480]  place works on any issue you've got to get a hearing before the committee moves
[02:02:35.480 --> 02:02:40.840]  it to the floor and I think if we could get a hearing with two or three panels
[02:02:40.840 --> 02:02:45.720]  of experts on the Constitution I think we could really convince Congress that
[02:02:45.720 --> 02:02:50.000]  we need to move this resolution forward so being on your shows very special and
[02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:54.080]  I appreciate are you kidding sir we want to thank you for having the courage to
[02:02:54.080 --> 02:02:58.680]  bring forward this and to work with Ron Paul's office I know that his his
[02:02:58.680 --> 02:03:02.680]  presidential campaign advisor constitutional scholar Bruce fine
[02:03:02.680 --> 02:03:06.800]  constitutional lawyer helped helped draft it it's absolutely constitutional
[02:03:06.800 --> 02:03:10.800]  we're about to go to break and and come back and go over those areas and then
[02:03:10.800 --> 02:03:15.080]  if you've got phone numbers or who we should call we who specifically should
[02:03:15.080 --> 02:03:18.480]  we talk to we've got phone numbers that we'll share that in the next break
[02:03:18.480 --> 02:03:24.360]  amazing we're about to go to break in about a minute separately explain to
[02:03:24.360 --> 02:03:27.840]  people why it's unconstitutional for a president to launch a war without a
[02:03:27.840 --> 02:03:33.440]  congressional approval well it's it's it's pretty explicit in the Constitution
[02:03:33.440 --> 02:03:40.760]  and we have bypassed this for so long going back to the Korean War and it's
[02:03:40.760 --> 02:03:47.200]  been article two section four of the Constitution and and Alex I tell you I
[02:03:47.200 --> 02:03:52.720]  was with the group in 1999 a couple Democrats but mostly Republicans we went
[02:03:52.720 --> 02:03:57.560]  to the federal courts on president Clinton deciding to go into Kosovo in
[02:03:57.560 --> 02:04:02.360]  bomb Kosovo the courts threw it back out because the courts always say well
[02:04:02.360 --> 02:04:06.360]  Congress has authority to cut the budgets when you go to war well we never
[02:04:06.360 --> 02:04:12.680]  do that then again in last year Dennis Kucinich and I were the two leads and
[02:04:12.680 --> 02:04:17.360]  two Republicans Ron Paul being one and two Democrats that made three Democrats
[02:04:17.360 --> 02:04:21.920]  count Dennis and three Republicans count me Walter Jones with Jonathan Tarly we
[02:04:21.920 --> 02:04:25.400]  went to the courts again on Libya we thought we had an excellent opportunity
[02:04:25.400 --> 02:04:29.240]  to legally speaking and the courts kicked it out and says no you've got the
[02:04:29.240 --> 02:04:34.520]  authority to cut cut the funding and Congress will never cut the funding and
[02:04:34.520 --> 02:04:38.240]  I'm not gonna be critical but you got kids over there given that life for a
[02:04:38.240 --> 02:04:42.000]  country you would hate to think well if I don't vote for this it might not get
[02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:46.400]  ammunition they need to defend themselves but that's kind of like the chicken or
[02:04:46.400 --> 02:04:49.640]  the egg because if you're sending them into a fraudulent war to begin with in
[02:04:49.640 --> 02:04:53.240]  the whole war you won't need the ammo stay right there Congress when we're
[02:04:53.240 --> 02:04:57.000]  gonna come right back on the other side and break all this down and give out
[02:04:57.000 --> 02:05:01.400]  some phone numbers to try to get this bill out there on the floor this is
[02:05:01.400 --> 02:05:04.720]  Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[02:05:04.720 --> 02:05:08.720]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[02:05:08.720 --> 02:05:12.960]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[02:05:12.960 --> 02:05:16.800]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[02:05:16.800 --> 02:05:20.680]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[02:05:20.680 --> 02:05:24.760]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[02:05:24.760 --> 02:05:29.120]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[02:05:29.120 --> 02:05:33.400]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[02:05:33.400 --> 02:05:37.120]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[02:05:37.120 --> 02:05:41.320]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[02:05:41.320 --> 02:05:44.320]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by

[02:07:58.240 --> 02:08:09.120]  he's the T-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[02:08:13.680 --> 02:08:19.960]  representative Walter B. Jones congressman from North Carolina is our
[02:08:19.960 --> 02:08:27.040]  guest and he is the man who introduced the legislation to pass a law that
[02:08:27.040 --> 02:08:32.960]  simply enforces the Constitution that if Obama launches one more military
[02:08:32.960 --> 02:08:38.360]  operation and tells Congress openly I don't need any authorization from you
[02:08:38.360 --> 02:08:42.880]  because since the police action of the Korean War they don't call it a
[02:08:42.880 --> 02:08:46.840]  declaration of war but still they get a congressional authorization and funding
[02:08:46.840 --> 02:08:52.080]  and Congress gives the go-ahead and for those that don't know the president
[02:08:52.080 --> 02:08:55.320]  isn't even the commander-in-chief until the war is declared and then he's the
[02:08:55.320 --> 02:08:58.880]  executive the Congress says here's the money here's the enemy here's what you
[02:08:58.880 --> 02:09:03.040]  do now you go out and command them George Washington basically okay that's
[02:09:03.040 --> 02:09:07.280]  what happens now it's just commander-in-chief and the Congress doesn't
[02:09:07.280 --> 02:09:13.400]  count they operate like potted plants or a ceremonial vestigial something of a
[02:09:13.400 --> 02:09:17.120]  bygone age and we saw the spectacle I'm gonna play a video clip of this coming
[02:09:17.120 --> 02:09:20.760]  up after the congressman speaks some because he needs our help and we need to
[02:09:20.760 --> 02:09:24.000]  help him because we're all Americans in this together he's had the courage to do
[02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:28.140]  this against these criminals because it is criminal launch a war the
[02:09:28.140 --> 02:09:33.040]  congressional approval it's treason but the point is we saw the spectacle a few
[02:09:33.040 --> 02:09:37.200]  months ago of the Secretary of Defense and others saying hey we don't need you
[02:09:37.200 --> 02:09:42.160]  anymore we have the UN authority and Obama's letter saying hey I don't just
[02:09:42.160 --> 02:09:47.040]  do this on my own he went one even further we have the UN saying so
[02:09:47.040 --> 02:09:54.320]  unbelievable now representative Jones has introduced a piece of legislation and
[02:09:54.320 --> 02:09:58.640]  he's gonna give you the number everything about it and he needs your help to get
[02:09:58.640 --> 02:10:02.840]  it rammed out a committee okay because they're trying to procedurally block it
[02:10:02.840 --> 02:10:06.520]  you notice you're seeing a media blackout on this show media across the
[02:10:06.520 --> 02:10:11.520]  country you need to have congressman Jones on and and and people need to get
[02:10:11.520 --> 02:10:15.520]  when Ron Paul's on asked him about this because Ron Paul's supporting it and his
[02:10:15.520 --> 02:10:20.000]  head policy advisor helped write this constitutional lawyer Bruce Fein
[02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:24.320]  congressman you've got the floor thank you so much for coming on with us what
[02:10:24.320 --> 02:10:28.560]  are we facing right now and how can we get the Constitution enforced Alice
[02:10:28.560 --> 02:10:32.280]  thank you for that your comments and you really nailed it but let me add to those
[02:10:32.280 --> 02:10:38.400]  as well as I mentioned earlier I was part of a group that in 1999 went to the
[02:10:38.400 --> 02:10:42.240]  federal courts by saying President Clinton should not have bypassed
[02:10:42.240 --> 02:10:48.080]  Kosovo I mean bomb Kosovo excuse me and and and he really did bypass Congress in
[02:10:48.080 --> 02:10:53.120]  the way and then Dennis Kucinich and I and Ron Paul we went to the federal
[02:10:53.120 --> 02:10:57.000]  courts a year ago with Jonathan Turley professor George Washington University
[02:10:57.000 --> 02:11:00.720]  Constitutional Lawyer to say to the federal courts Obama should not have
[02:11:00.720 --> 02:11:05.560]  gone and to live either way he did he bypassed the Constitution in our
[02:11:05.560 --> 02:11:11.240]  opinion and and he bypassed Congress and that's why this is so important we
[02:11:11.240 --> 02:11:18.680]  need to have a debate this is a vehicle for debate it's H. Kahn resolution 107
[02:11:18.680 --> 02:11:27.120]  in fact your listeners can just say HCR 107 HCR 107 and let me read very
[02:11:27.120 --> 02:11:32.960]  briefly the title expressing the sense of Congress that the use of offensive
[02:11:32.960 --> 02:11:37.400]  military force by president without prior prior excuse me and clear
[02:11:37.400 --> 02:11:41.680]  authorization of an act of Congress constitutes an impeachable high crime
[02:11:41.680 --> 02:11:47.480]  and misdemeanor under article 2 section for the Constitution and Alex if your
[02:11:47.480 --> 02:11:56.440]  if your listeners would please write down this number it's 202-224-3121 let
[02:11:56.440 --> 02:12:05.200]  me repeat one more time 202-224-3121 that is the United States
[02:12:05.200 --> 02:12:10.080]  Capitol switchboard all the listeners have to do is to call that number and
[02:12:10.080 --> 02:12:14.880]  say I would like to speak to Congressman X and then they will put them into the
[02:12:14.880 --> 02:12:18.920]  office the Congressman X and the person that answers the phone what that
[02:12:18.920 --> 02:12:24.480]  individual should say is I am so and so this is my congressman I want to ask him
[02:12:24.480 --> 02:12:34.000]  to join HCR 107 and help Congress get the nerve it needs to defend the
[02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:38.080]  Constitution when this country goes to war it's not fair to our military it's
[02:12:38.080 --> 02:12:42.800]  not fair to men and women the uniform and it's not fair to the taxpayer but we
[02:12:42.800 --> 02:12:46.520]  have a president I don't care if it's the Democratic Republic that bypasses
[02:12:46.520 --> 02:12:50.960]  Congress to go to war let's go back to what the Constitution requires is a
[02:12:50.960 --> 02:12:59.840]  declaration of war Congressman I want to continue on this line with people folks
[02:12:59.840 --> 02:13:08.640]  you need to call and tell them to get behind this resolution 202-224-3121-202-224-3121
[02:13:08.640 --> 02:13:13.520]  this obviously is extremely newsworthy that that Ron Paul yourself and others
[02:13:13.520 --> 02:13:18.320]  have done this and the fact that there's been almost no media coverage since you
[02:13:18.320 --> 02:13:22.880]  first did this what a month and a half ago or so a time sure flies shows that
[02:13:22.880 --> 02:13:27.520]  they're scared of this Junie getting out of the bottle this is a big deal that
[02:13:27.520 --> 02:13:32.520]  not only did he launch the war in Libya but when it was brought up he put out a
[02:13:32.520 --> 02:13:36.600]  letter saying the UN gives me authority I mean that is beyond just launching a
[02:13:36.600 --> 02:13:40.720]  war and the president doing on his own which is totally unconstitutional but
[02:13:40.720 --> 02:13:47.680]  it's the UN doing it and it clearly violates article 1 clause 8 article 1
[02:13:47.680 --> 02:13:52.640]  section 8 clause 11 again article 1 section 8 clause 11 clearly Congress's
[02:13:52.640 --> 02:13:59.120]  overall of this that's not our opinion it's a fact and so it's it's even worse
[02:13:59.120 --> 02:14:03.400]  for the president to do this and say the UN gave him the authority now there's
[02:14:03.400 --> 02:14:07.920]  all sorts of stuff going on backing Al Qaeda even the LA Times admits Al Qaeda
[02:14:07.920 --> 02:14:12.080]  is being funded by the West to attack Assad I'm not saying the Syrian regime's
[02:14:12.080 --> 02:14:18.080]  good guys but compared to Al Qaeda how is this not a bigger news issue Alex you
[02:14:18.080 --> 02:14:23.400]  you're you're exactly right I I had bought the book and I would recommend it
[02:14:23.400 --> 02:14:29.720]  to many of your listeners it's called funding the enemy our US tax payers
[02:14:29.720 --> 02:14:35.200]  bank rough bankroll scheme at the Taliban it's by Douglas with the name
[02:14:35.200 --> 02:14:43.040]  they've got SS ING with thing and it continues to show that's why this H
[02:14:43.040 --> 02:14:49.440]  Khan resolution 107 important once we go to war we forget the obligation and the
[02:14:49.440 --> 02:14:54.480]  commitment to the troops and to the American people by just spending money
[02:14:54.480 --> 02:14:59.560]  we don't have we've already spent 1.3 trillion dollars in Afghanistan Iraq
[02:14:59.560 --> 02:15:03.720]  that's not being paid for by Congress that is on the credit card waiting to be
[02:15:03.720 --> 02:15:08.600]  paid for by the next generation that's why H Khan resolution is is so
[02:15:08.600 --> 02:15:14.240]  important because 107 will make Congress debate its role we have forgotten our
[02:15:14.240 --> 02:15:18.520]  role when it comes to war and that's what this is all about and then you feel
[02:15:18.520 --> 02:15:23.800]  strong about it I feel strong about it well again think of how moral it is to
[02:15:23.800 --> 02:15:27.440]  make troops serve more than one tour summer in their sixth seventh or eighth
[02:15:27.440 --> 02:15:32.840]  suicides at all-time records outpacing even you know deaths you know from the
[02:15:32.840 --> 02:15:39.920]  conflict and where they're 11 years all of this is going on and it's all about
[02:15:39.920 --> 02:15:43.920]  the contractors and the and and these interest-making money they just wanted
[02:15:43.920 --> 02:15:49.080]  to go forever this is a completely sick joke and it was never even declared and
[02:15:49.080 --> 02:15:53.880]  we can't ever seem to get out of it and in meanwhile Obama wants to start all
[02:15:53.880 --> 02:16:00.640]  of these new wars again ladies and gentlemen it's HCR 107 concurrent
[02:16:00.640 --> 02:16:07.200]  resolution get behind it call Congress 202 224 3121 what do we need to do to get
[02:16:07.200 --> 02:16:11.320]  this out of committee congressman well we're getting a lot of the more members
[02:16:11.320 --> 02:16:14.880]  we can get on the bill I have spoken and written to the chairman of the
[02:16:14.880 --> 02:16:19.640]  Morris mayor from Texas who I think is friendly to the issue but I want him to
[02:16:19.640 --> 02:16:23.720]  feel the pressure of the people forget me feel the pressure of the people from
[02:16:23.720 --> 02:16:27.520]  around this country that want the Constitution protected and want the
[02:16:27.520 --> 02:16:30.880]  Constitution to be used if ever we're gonna commit our young men and women to
[02:16:30.880 --> 02:16:36.720]  die sure I mean I noticed a lot of these mainline Republican radio shows they
[02:16:36.720 --> 02:16:40.320]  just think it's patriotic me behind wars so they're actually supporting Obama
[02:16:40.320 --> 02:16:45.120]  in all these wars you would think that they would want to cover a move to
[02:16:45.120 --> 02:16:50.120]  impeach Obama for saying the UN gives the president orders I mean he's on record
[02:16:50.120 --> 02:16:54.640]  I mean I say start impeachment right now why not just go right into impeachment
[02:16:54.640 --> 02:16:58.640]  proceedings and see if the media tries to ignore that well you know Alice what
[02:16:58.640 --> 02:17:03.160]  along the lines of what you're saying the Secretary of Defense Panetta spoke
[02:17:03.160 --> 02:17:06.880]  before the Armed Service Committee about three weeks ago and Randy Forbes from
[02:17:06.880 --> 02:17:11.600]  Virginia and I was I was in in line before Randy to ask the question and then
[02:17:11.600 --> 02:17:16.720]  I piggybacked on this HCOM 107 and then Randy got had a very fine question for
[02:17:16.720 --> 02:17:21.080]  Mr. Panetta and you're right basically what he says well we have to we have to
[02:17:21.080 --> 02:17:25.840]  talk with our friends from coalition friends before we come to Congress I
[02:17:25.840 --> 02:17:32.160]  mean for God's sakes I mean how sad and how tragic is that thought process sir I
[02:17:32.160 --> 02:17:35.400]  did the media didn't cover it a few months ago we did it in the Senate it
[02:17:35.400 --> 02:17:39.560]  got attention you're saying he repeated what he said two months ago yeah he did
[02:17:39.560 --> 02:17:43.280]  about three weeks ago in the Armed Services Committee absolutely wow so we
[02:17:43.280 --> 02:17:46.920]  just looked that up on C-Span that's gonna be important news that shows the
[02:17:46.920 --> 02:17:50.480]  incredible news blackout I'm sorry go ahead well no you're right and and
[02:17:50.480 --> 02:17:56.120]  that's why thank you and everyone else has taken the interest in an ACR 107
[02:17:56.120 --> 02:18:02.160]  because I want the American people to understand they can control Congress by
[02:18:02.160 --> 02:18:05.720]  saying Congress lived by the Constitution what Ron Paul's been
[02:18:05.720 --> 02:18:09.400]  preaching for years what you've been preaching for years and and this is just
[02:18:09.400 --> 02:18:12.920]  a small step in protecting the Constitution that's all this is about
[02:18:12.920 --> 02:18:15.200]  you were bringing that up to me during the break you talked about it some on
[02:18:15.200 --> 02:18:17.840]  air congressman but I mean again you guys have gone to the courts and they
[02:18:17.840 --> 02:18:22.520]  say look you've got the authority stop asking us you're right that's that's
[02:18:22.520 --> 02:18:27.560]  where the fallacy comes in and and the federal courts believe that Congress has
[02:18:27.560 --> 02:18:32.680]  the authority to stop a war by cutting the budget and and fairness to members
[02:18:32.680 --> 02:18:36.360]  of Congress and I was this way at one time myself you don't want to cut the
[02:18:36.360 --> 02:18:40.040]  budget because you know those troops over in a foreign country need ammunition
[02:18:40.040 --> 02:18:43.280]  to fight and if you got them over there unless you gonna bring them home you got
[02:18:43.280 --> 02:18:49.120]  to give them the ammunition and that's why again I greatly appreciate this I I'm
[02:18:49.120 --> 02:18:53.760]  just sick and tired of being in in a Congress that advocates its
[02:18:53.760 --> 02:18:59.560]  responsibility to the executive branch especially when it comes to war well
[02:18:59.560 --> 02:19:04.160]  it's illegal sir as you know it's not really well you're right but we're
[02:19:04.160 --> 02:19:07.680]  partially to blame that's the reason I put this in there I want Congress to say
[02:19:07.680 --> 02:19:13.240]  by God we are given this responsibility by the Constitution and we're gonna
[02:19:13.240 --> 02:19:17.080]  meet our Constitutional responsibility we haven't done that since the since
[02:19:17.080 --> 02:19:21.080]  World War two and it's getting worse absolutely we're now the president that
[02:19:21.080 --> 02:19:24.560]  doesn't even get any type of resolution not just a declaration and now he says
[02:19:24.560 --> 02:19:29.000]  the UN's the boss we should make this the big issue bipartisan every
[02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:32.800]  congressman or woman when they go out to give speeches in their district folks
[02:19:32.800 --> 02:19:38.000]  go out and confront them and say when are you gonna do your job that is what's
[02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:41.760]  important we got to get behind representative member of Congress
[02:19:41.760 --> 02:19:49.120]  mr. Jones right now we've got to get behind this legislation HCR 107 202 224

[02:24:19.120 --> 02:24:22.920]  ago we're gonna get the video maybe even on alley news tonight from the radio
[02:24:22.920 --> 02:24:27.000]  tomorrow we'll have it here for you ask the same questions of the secretary
[02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:30.800]  defense and then he said the same thing yeah no we got to check with allies we
[02:24:30.800 --> 02:24:34.120]  got to get the authority from the UN I don't know if we'll ever come to you to
[02:24:34.120 --> 02:24:37.520]  see what you think they're like so you're saying you don't get that authority
[02:24:37.520 --> 02:24:42.000]  from us no we don't and Obama has put out a letter saying oh yeah congress is
[02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:46.680]  involved in wars that is of course completely upside down so here's a
[02:24:46.680 --> 02:24:50.920]  quick clip of that we're going back to congressman jones who is moving forward
[02:24:50.920 --> 02:24:55.120]  with legislation that can begin the impeachment of Obama if he tries this
[02:24:55.120 --> 02:24:59.160]  again here's a clip from a few months ago where Panetta told the Senate that I
[02:24:59.160 --> 02:25:02.160]  can't play the whole thing he says it over and over again but here's a quick
[02:25:02.160 --> 02:25:08.000]  snippet that you can act without Congress to and initiate a no-fly zone in
[02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:16.200]  Syria without congressional approval you know again our goal would be to to
[02:25:16.200 --> 02:25:20.800]  seek international permission and we would we would come to the Congress and
[02:25:20.800 --> 02:25:26.720]  inform you and determine how best to approach this whether or not we would
[02:25:26.720 --> 02:25:31.480]  want to get permission from the Congress I think those are issues we would
[02:25:31.480 --> 02:25:37.080]  have to discuss as we decide what to do here well I'm almost breathless about
[02:25:37.080 --> 02:25:41.840]  that because what I heard you say is we're going to seek international
[02:25:41.840 --> 02:25:46.640]  approval and they will come and tell the Congress what we might do and we might
[02:25:46.640 --> 02:25:51.040]  seek congressional approval no well I want to just say to you that's a big dish
[02:25:51.040 --> 02:25:56.120]  when you agree you've served in the Congress yeah when you agree that that's
[02:25:56.120 --> 02:26:01.040]  would be pretty breathtaking to the average American so would you like to
[02:26:01.040 --> 02:26:07.320]  clarify that but I've you know we I've also served with Republican presidents
[02:26:07.320 --> 02:26:11.960]  and Democratic presidents who has always reserved the right to defend this
[02:26:11.960 --> 02:26:17.120]  country if necessary okay there you go spins it that the UN ordering the
[02:26:17.120 --> 02:26:21.280]  president around is patriotic and the Congress isn't that was an amazing
[02:26:21.280 --> 02:26:24.920]  little response and Panetta smiles he knows full well that's illegal
[02:26:24.920 --> 02:26:28.680]  Congressman Jones you're right and I tell you Alex it was we were in the
[02:26:28.680 --> 02:26:32.520]  process of drafting this again Bruce fine help me with this which you bar
[02:26:32.520 --> 02:26:36.280]  acknowledge but when I heard that exchange with those of sessions from
[02:26:36.280 --> 02:26:40.760]  Alabama and Defense Secretary Panetta I said we're gonna drop that bill next
[02:26:40.760 --> 02:26:46.760]  week and we did is just absolutely that the arrogance of any administration and
[02:26:46.760 --> 02:26:51.480]  I mean Republican or Democrat any administration to think that they have
[02:26:51.480 --> 02:26:57.560]  the authority based on international law and understanding instead of the
[02:26:57.560 --> 02:27:02.360]  Constitution that's that that is just not acceptable in America that's all
[02:27:02.360 --> 02:27:06.440]  that's right Bush for the ill-fated Iraq situation I'm not defending him but he
[02:27:06.440 --> 02:27:11.280]  went and at least got a resolution and and and Congress then got the funding
[02:27:11.280 --> 02:27:15.320]  this is just a slap in the face hey you're not even in the equation anymore
[02:27:15.320 --> 02:27:20.800]  shut up and and and Alex there's a there's a concern up here by Ryan Paul
[02:27:20.800 --> 02:27:26.520]  and all those in myself included that this president could be encouraged to go
[02:27:26.520 --> 02:27:32.080]  into Iran or be supportive of an invasion of Iran and I've always said
[02:27:32.080 --> 02:27:36.800]  listen that I get great great respect for Israel if Israel feels like they must
[02:27:36.800 --> 02:27:40.960]  protect themselves in fine but I cannot see this country that's financially
[02:27:40.960 --> 02:27:45.160]  broke known as the United States of America getting involved in these kind
[02:27:45.160 --> 02:27:48.920]  of situations and especially if they bypass the Constitution and you've
[02:27:48.920 --> 02:27:51.800]  got news for us that Ron Paul and you're gonna support it he's got a
[02:27:51.800 --> 02:27:54.920]  resolution tomorrow tell us about that yeah he's gonna have an amendment we're
[02:27:54.920 --> 02:27:58.920]  debating the armed services bill called the NDA a National Defense
[02:27:58.920 --> 02:28:05.280]  Authorization Act and Ryan Paul's gonna have a amendment to Dale tomorrow that
[02:28:05.280 --> 02:28:12.000]  will basically say nothing in this NDA a bill gives any authority to to attack
[02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:17.400]  Iran and that's but it's that simple nothing in this bill that we're gonna
[02:28:17.400 --> 02:28:22.280]  pass is any authority to attack Iran it's a multi-page bill that's what he's
[02:28:22.280 --> 02:28:28.080]  doing it's like 200 300 pages and it's just it's just a protection amendments
[02:28:28.080 --> 02:28:31.520]  what he's doing and God bless my friend Ron Paul sure because it's got some of
[02:28:31.520 --> 02:28:34.920]  that sanctioned stuff in there last time I checked and they can probably use that
[02:28:34.920 --> 02:28:38.560]  to then claim that force is involved to enforce them and then I mean they call
[02:28:38.560 --> 02:28:42.880]  dropping bombs on Libya and helping Al Qaeda humanitarian aid there's no
[02:28:42.880 --> 02:28:46.960]  telling what they'll do and and Alex you and your listeners know what we have
[02:28:46.960 --> 02:28:51.600]  done in these foreign countries we are creating a worse situation I'm not for
[02:28:51.600 --> 02:28:56.400]  dictators I'm not for despots but for God's sakes if you're going into an area
[02:28:56.400 --> 02:28:59.640]  and you're gonna make things worse then you you need to think about your policy
[02:28:59.640 --> 02:29:05.280]  before you do it amazing congressman Jones has introduced legislation he needs
[02:29:05.280 --> 02:29:07.840]  your help to get it rammed through and out on the floor

[02:37:24.520 --> 02:37:29.400]  weird sometimes just because it's like personal phone calls on air let's go
[02:37:29.400 --> 02:37:33.720]  ahead and talk to Steve in Florida Steve you're on the air yeah hey good
[02:37:33.720 --> 02:37:38.400]  afternoon I wanted to say first of all thank you for putting information out
[02:37:38.400 --> 02:37:43.160]  there about the longevity products I've been using the tangy tangerine and I
[02:37:43.160 --> 02:37:47.840]  just got the rebound I haven't used it yet but I run I'm getting ready to run
[02:37:47.840 --> 02:37:51.840]  in a marathon so I'm looking forward to incorporating the rebound but the tangy
[02:37:51.840 --> 02:37:56.080]  tangerine I can see how people would use loose weight with it because it's
[02:37:56.080 --> 02:38:00.560]  definitely an appetite suppressor because it satisfies you at the cellular
[02:38:00.560 --> 02:38:04.600]  level with all the minerals and vitamins that you need look look I'm trying to get
[02:38:04.600 --> 02:38:08.240]  in shape and I know the globalists have adulterated the food and the food's
[02:38:08.240 --> 02:38:12.040]  grown in most areas with hardly any minerals or trace elements so I did
[02:38:12.040 --> 02:38:16.760]  research found young Jevity we discounted at info wars team.com I only
[02:38:16.760 --> 02:38:19.680]  promote what I believe it and that's why we're promoting it what else is on your
[02:38:19.680 --> 02:38:24.840]  mind today yeah I wanted to say that I have a suggestion as far as what we
[02:38:24.840 --> 02:38:29.040]  referred to these globalists as you know and I've referred to them as this
[02:38:29.040 --> 02:38:34.120]  myself as the global elite however the word elite means like the best of the
[02:38:34.120 --> 02:38:39.320]  best yeah we should call them we should call them the wickedest of the wicked
[02:38:39.320 --> 02:38:43.120]  well they're the worst of the worst so what I would suggest is call them the
[02:38:43.120 --> 02:38:48.800]  global delete for two reasons they are subjecting us to a technocracy and want
[02:38:48.800 --> 02:38:54.000]  to delete us all through eugenics but eventually these guys themselves are
[02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:58.080]  going to get what they've given out they will be deleted because Jesus says
[02:38:58.080 --> 02:39:01.880]  when he comes back these in the false prophet are going to be taken and cast
[02:39:01.880 --> 02:39:06.720]  alive into the lake of fire so they're going to be deleted permanently. Amen to
[02:39:06.720 --> 02:39:09.120]  that brother well that's why they try to play God everything they do is a
[02:39:09.120 --> 02:39:14.480]  counterfeit of creation and of the creator of that creation they say they
[02:39:14.480 --> 02:39:17.680]  want to play God they think they're going to become God Ray Kurzweil all of
[02:39:17.680 --> 02:39:21.720]  them it's the same deal they're going to take over they're having us pay them
[02:39:21.720 --> 02:39:26.560]  through Apple Google all of it and Sony and the rest of it for the equipment
[02:39:26.560 --> 02:39:31.520]  globally with spy systems built into it to track it enslave us in taxes it's a
[02:39:31.520 --> 02:39:36.240]  big joke the entire technocracies going in and they're bragging about it can
[02:39:36.240 --> 02:39:39.720]  you imagine five years ago six years ago we have bush when he got caught doing
[02:39:39.720 --> 02:39:42.920]  warrantless wiretapping of citizens how much trouble he got in should have gone
[02:39:42.920 --> 02:39:47.840]  to jail it's illegal now the CIA director goes yeah we listen everything you do
[02:39:47.840 --> 02:39:53.440]  haha on TV you're like yeah all the appliances have tech to watch you yep
[02:39:53.440 --> 02:39:58.040]  it's true you don't have a fourth amendment I mean it's a confession of
[02:39:58.040 --> 02:40:03.200]  their criminal activity they now admit all over the country the feds are
[02:40:03.200 --> 02:40:07.280]  instructing schools to take children's DNA without their parents telling them
[02:40:07.280 --> 02:40:10.680]  same thing in England I remember five six years ago they would have kids
[02:40:10.680 --> 02:40:15.040]  march in elementary school and go enroll in a retina scan a thumbprint your
[02:40:15.040 --> 02:40:19.640]  James Bond spies now don't tell mommy and daddy a lot of the kids get into the
[02:40:19.640 --> 02:40:23.560]  role-playing and it's and the schools would deny they were doing it but then
[02:40:23.560 --> 02:40:28.840]  the curriculum got released totally turning the kids against the parents the
[02:40:28.840 --> 02:40:35.320]  government is out of control set the guy that called in yesterday and the two
[02:40:35.320 --> 02:40:38.600]  off-duty cops were talking about yeah I choked this guy for no reason yeah he was
[02:40:38.600 --> 02:40:42.640]  begging for his life yeah we broke this guy's arm man I just love beating people
[02:40:42.640 --> 02:40:46.160]  and the guys like my gosh I was actually sitting there listening to him yeah
[02:40:46.160 --> 02:40:52.000]  that's who they want the military wants gangbangers and criminals the police
[02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:59.360]  want that they're building an army of evil every criminal government does it
[02:40:59.360 --> 02:41:04.560]  it's happening it's real and they got everybody in these peer pressure
[02:41:04.560 --> 02:41:07.840]  systems the public the police everybody just to get an acclimate it because they
[02:41:07.840 --> 02:41:10.960]  do it incrementally a little more a little more a little more pretty soon
[02:41:10.960 --> 02:41:17.080]  you're in bad shape and we're there I mean impeachment proceedings have begun
[02:41:17.080 --> 02:41:20.600]  against Obama it's never in the news
[02:41:20.800 --> 02:41:25.000]  reeducation camp documents to arrest us for our political views and put us in
[02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:33.320]  brainwashing camps are confirmed by the army zero news coverage zero because not
[02:41:33.320 --> 02:41:37.640]  just that the media is controlled but most these alternative media and radio
[02:41:37.640 --> 02:41:42.680]  hosts and others they always were told this wasn't real so even as it's now
[02:41:42.680 --> 02:41:48.600]  admitted they still don't want to cover it because it might look quote kooky
[02:41:48.600 --> 02:41:53.520]  people never want to believe the stories were coming out about the Soviets
[02:41:53.520 --> 02:41:58.880]  killing tens of millions and our media said it's not true uncle Joe is a nice
[02:41:58.880 --> 02:42:08.600]  guy uncle Joe was what they call Joseph Stalin don't look up I've gone to the
[02:42:08.600 --> 02:42:11.280]  microfilm I've done articles on it years ago how to do that how to dig those
[02:42:11.280 --> 02:42:16.720]  out and we showed articles from the 1940s going oh it's not true they have
[02:42:16.720 --> 02:42:26.360]  reeducation camps over there he's uncle Joe he loves America and then people
[02:42:26.360 --> 02:42:29.520]  that got concerned about that said our own military and governments funding him
[02:42:29.520 --> 02:42:34.040]  oh well they were the conspiracy coach they were the bad people well now we
[02:42:34.040 --> 02:42:41.840]  know Joseph Stalin killed over 30 million people it's like it's not polite
[02:42:41.840 --> 02:42:46.680]  oh now Alex is worried about a big government so they've got some
[02:42:46.680 --> 02:42:50.320]  reeducation camps so the TSA setting up highway checkpoints is taking their
[02:42:50.320 --> 02:42:57.400]  hands down our pants what's the big deal I mean come on don't be so alarmist

[02:43:15.600 --> 02:43:20.440]  impossible to pay back anyways you know what thank goodness there's a bank of
[02:43:20.440 --> 02:43:23.520]  the world getting set up a new corporate world government but you're still

[02:43:26.880 --> 02:43:29.520]  believed in the world government they were proven right but that makes them
[02:43:29.520 --> 02:43:36.600]  even worse they're they're alarmist bad people you know what oh over 90% of the
[02:43:36.600 --> 02:43:40.480]  FDA and EPA scientists have gone public three separate times and signed letters

[02:46:07.440 --> 02:46:15.520]  the innocence reach my soul every day because I'm looking up to God and I
[02:46:15.520 --> 02:46:19.760]  can see the reflection back of the of the pain that God sees humanity going
[02:46:19.760 --> 02:46:24.040]  through because people choose evil

[02:46:56.760 --> 02:47:00.440]  sorry well that's why it's important for people to talk to each other don't
[02:47:00.440 --> 02:47:03.600]  trust the TV to give you all the facts talk to your community talk to the
[02:47:03.600 --> 02:47:07.080]  people around you start getting involved with petitions for anything
[02:47:07.080 --> 02:47:10.720]  whether it's cleaning floor right out of your water demanding healthier food in
[02:47:10.720 --> 02:47:16.760]  your supermarkets this is the steps you have to begin with is talking to other
[02:47:16.760 --> 02:47:24.040]  people and getting involved I agree with you I absolutely agree with you what

[02:47:53.120 --> 02:47:56.400]  that's why you can't wake America up because most of them are brain damaged
[02:47:56.400 --> 02:48:02.000]  it's a trans like state everyone to the robotic zombie like state and that's
[02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:07.240]  why it honestly starting with war is honestly a good step because once you
[02:48:07.240 --> 02:48:10.320]  get that out you actually get people to start listening a little bit better
[02:48:10.320 --> 02:48:14.800]  that's why people should find every single petitions the removed fluoride on
[02:48:14.800 --> 02:48:18.960]  the internet or in their local communities they can find everybody should
[02:48:18.960 --> 02:48:22.720]  fight it themselves or having victories that's what's even more frustrating when
[02:48:22.720 --> 02:48:28.600]  people keep taking action and hammering the enemy we always end up winning we've
[02:48:28.600 --> 02:48:32.120]  got the power that's what's so frustrating these globalists are like
[02:48:32.120 --> 02:48:37.360]  two-inch chicken neck pus filled stinking cowardly little goblins and
[02:48:37.360 --> 02:48:43.760]  we're like 10,000 foot iron statues we can just crush them but instead we're on
[02:48:43.760 --> 02:48:50.000]  our knees begging to the chicken neck I mean it's such a joke it's honestly
[02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:53.600]  entertaining to see even what local officials try to use for excuses on all
[02:48:53.600 --> 02:48:59.080]  of these issues are not servants they're officials you know you go to government
[02:48:59.080 --> 02:49:02.840]  meetings and you watch these nobodies and their little outfits power tripping
[02:49:02.840 --> 02:49:06.080]  like birds that want to sit higher in the tree that they're up there at the
[02:49:06.080 --> 02:49:11.920]  dais it's pathetic the real exercise of power is a responsibility and a weight
[02:49:11.920 --> 02:49:16.920]  it is so pathetic looking at these people I'm sorry I'm sorry go ahead it's
[02:49:16.920 --> 02:49:22.880]  just a cult of skeletons get us award winners it's crazy I appreciate your

[02:49:35.920 --> 02:49:39.600]  department here try to tell us when we got our petition on the news again
[02:49:39.600 --> 02:49:44.000]  studying for I tried to tell us it was a natural occurring material that would
[02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:48.400]  appear in water naturally even if we didn't put it in no they lie to you and
[02:49:48.400 --> 02:49:52.640]  talk to you like you're a moron I mean literally TSA will ask me where I'm
[02:49:52.640 --> 02:49:56.360]  going and try to do their little assessment thing and I just look at
[02:49:56.360 --> 02:49:59.960]  them and I literally will say things like it's on record the government
[02:49:59.960 --> 02:50:04.480]  controlled the underwear bomber it's on record that this is all staged and by
[02:50:04.480 --> 02:50:07.600]  the way you're gonna get cancer from those scanners no I'm not I go oh really
[02:50:07.600 --> 02:50:12.480]  you believe the government when you're told the lie to us all day stop acting
[02:50:12.480 --> 02:50:17.440]  powerful please stop acting powerful and let me tell you they're dressing down
[02:50:17.440 --> 02:50:21.000]  I haven't flown out of Austin in like four or five months I'm told now that
[02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:24.240]  state reps they know who they are and stuff they are dressing them down well
[02:50:24.240 --> 02:50:28.000]  it's on record San Antonio they know who they are and go get over here you don't
[02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:31.760]  like us get over here I mean they're telling them you are God you rule
[02:50:31.760 --> 02:50:35.800]  everyone I mean they are just again they didn't do it through the police because
[02:50:35.800 --> 02:50:38.920]  there's at least some constitutional training there just like every
[02:50:38.920 --> 02:50:43.600]  authoritarian regime they go scrape the bottom of the barrel and they find a
[02:50:43.600 --> 02:50:47.240]  bunch of idiots and tell them they're God and that's why they keep flipping out
[02:50:47.240 --> 02:50:50.760]  and running around screaming their God and stripping down naked you're a new
[02:50:50.760 --> 02:50:54.880]  listener I'm not joking in Maryland and California they strip down naked begin
[02:50:54.880 --> 02:50:58.960]  screaming I'm God I'm God didn't start flopping around the ground that's NBC News
[02:50:58.960 --> 02:51:04.240]  and Associated Press look it up a little over a year ago I began to do a lot of
[02:51:04.240 --> 02:51:08.080]  research into why even if I had a pretty good-sized meal that I was still
[02:51:08.080 --> 02:51:12.600]  starving and my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils
[02:51:12.600 --> 02:51:15.440]  that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the
[02:51:15.440 --> 02:51:19.720]  industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the

[02:56:49.880 --> 02:56:53.240]  wrote when technology fails he's all done research says it's the best it was
[02:56:53.240 --> 02:56:57.360]  just so many people in my research it kept coming up this type of seaweed
[02:56:57.360 --> 02:57:02.480]  because it's all good but this stuff is is it okay I'm done I'm done talking
[02:57:02.480 --> 02:57:07.960]  about that I want to go break and come back take a few calls but where is my
[02:57:07.960 --> 02:57:13.440]  news on that it's see I was reading this it made me think of that NNSA
[02:57:13.440 --> 02:57:17.360]  measuring background radiation over Baltimore government security news and
[02:57:17.360 --> 02:57:26.480]  they say ahead of government meetings there they are testing it to see if you
[02:57:26.480 --> 02:57:30.080]  know there's any type of attack or anything coming it's totally ridiculous
[02:57:30.080 --> 02:57:34.560]  there they're worried about that meanwhile and I've shown you this on the
[02:57:34.560 --> 02:57:38.440]  FDA's own website of the EPA's the main group that made the ruling but the FDA
[02:57:38.440 --> 02:57:44.440]  also ran with it saying oh this isotope can be a thousand times stronger and then
[02:57:44.440 --> 02:57:47.400]  this one can be a hundred and twenty five times stronger they listed dozens and
[02:57:47.400 --> 02:57:50.720]  dozens of isotopes I read it on there you can look it up you know back last
[02:57:50.720 --> 02:57:55.120]  year because it went up in milk and in cabbage and in all this stuff that grows
[02:57:55.120 --> 02:58:01.720]  on the surface lettuce and so instead of just saying you know we better test
[02:58:01.720 --> 02:58:05.240]  this stuff and then warn people or ban it for a while like they did after
[02:58:05.240 --> 02:58:08.240]  Chernobyl this is much bigger than Chernobyl and all blows right across the
[02:58:08.240 --> 02:58:11.840]  ocean to us that's how the trade winds go from Japan and they're still melting
[02:58:11.840 --> 02:58:17.000]  down there's radiation still coming I even get to the key part of this instead
[02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:20.280]  of that they just say oh everything's fine meanwhile Fukushima to blame for
[02:58:20.280 --> 02:58:25.200]  mysterious illnesses striking hundreds of flight attendants it's been confirmed
[02:58:25.200 --> 02:58:30.000]  that the sea life the seals have their hair falling out there's mass deaths of
[02:58:30.000 --> 02:58:34.920]  animals that's where the main water that had all that radiation is swirling in
[02:58:34.920 --> 02:58:38.480]  the currents it's all hitting Alaska and now the flight attendants think it's

[03:00:58.400 --> 03:01:02.280]  would start hitting Alaska in just two months took a year for the water to hit
[03:01:02.280 --> 03:01:05.760]  California southern Canada northern Mexico and now that's happening there
[03:01:05.760 --> 03:01:11.360]  too it took a year took a few months to hit Alaska and boy it's bad when you
[03:01:11.360 --> 03:01:16.400]  got a plutonium reactor blowing up and hundreds of thousands of fuel rods you
[03:01:16.400 --> 03:01:21.240]  heard me right hundreds of thousands you know I had that number in my mind and
[03:01:21.240 --> 03:01:29.680]  now I can't remember guys search the term number of fuel rods at Fukushima I
[03:01:29.680 --> 03:01:33.440]  want to say total it was something like 400,000 ridiculous number and they were
[03:01:33.440 --> 03:01:36.520]  storing them on top the reactors they were blowing up and shooting and some of
[03:01:36.520 --> 03:01:39.440]  them a mile and a half away into the ocean even the New York Times reported
[03:01:39.440 --> 03:01:42.840]  six months after we broke it I could watch the video I looked at the specs
[03:01:42.840 --> 03:01:45.360]  on those reactors and I found out they were storing them on top and I said those
[03:01:45.360 --> 03:01:48.760]  are fuel rods all that other not other not had nuclear physicists on yeah those
[03:01:48.760 --> 03:01:51.960]  are fuel rods turned out I was right the point is I forget the number and
[03:01:51.960 --> 03:01:56.480]  usually my mind knows the exact number and I want to say I'm wrong on that
[03:01:56.480 --> 03:02:03.440]  no okay three thousand five hundred and fifty fuel rods each reactor building
[03:02:03.440 --> 03:02:09.880]  pool holds no no that was the pools oh I was underestimating yeah because five of
[03:02:09.880 --> 03:02:15.520]  the six blew up and only four really bad it's six hundred thousand so they
[03:02:15.520 --> 03:02:18.520]  estimate it was four hundred and I think forty something thousand that blew
[03:02:18.520 --> 03:02:23.520]  there it is six hundred thousand spent fuel rods so it's worse than I said of
[03:02:23.520 --> 03:02:28.320]  course it was and what's the source on that is that AP or popular mechanics
[03:02:28.320 --> 03:02:31.120]  scroll that back down as popular mechanics can't believe them but the
[03:02:31.120 --> 03:02:34.400]  Japanese government said that's how many were I just scroll down so I can see the
[03:02:34.400 --> 03:02:37.560]  source on that I just want to see the top there of the article that's all I
[03:02:37.560 --> 03:02:45.240]  want is just the top of the article that's info wars.com but where did we
[03:02:45.240 --> 03:02:49.040]  get that from go ahead and scroll down remember it was all over the news because
[03:02:49.040 --> 03:02:53.360]  that graphic right there that was from says read the full report here click on
[03:02:53.360 --> 03:02:58.920]  that there you go oh that's an actual government report about the Daiachi
[03:02:58.920 --> 03:03:03.320]  power station yeah there you go that's Tokyo electric power company that's our
[03:03:03.320 --> 03:03:07.720]  source well there you go no righty there I said four hundred thousand six hundred
[03:03:07.720 --> 03:03:11.520]  thousand but I'm right it was four hundred plus now four hundred and forty
[03:03:11.520 --> 03:03:15.360]  six thousand that was the number that actually blew sky high boom my brain
[03:03:15.360 --> 03:03:19.440]  wasn't working I apologize I was having a monkey howl nine thousand just a moment
[03:03:19.440 --> 03:03:23.040]  just a moment Dave all right let's we are electrochemical computers you know
[03:03:23.040 --> 03:03:28.360]  that Adam and Puerto Rico you're on the air welcome and thank you yeah hi Alex
[03:03:28.360 --> 03:03:31.920]  how are you oh I'm gone completely insane I don't like tearing it go ahead
[03:03:31.920 --> 03:03:38.280]  yes yeah me neither um I have an idea for a t-shirt I was thinking and the
[03:03:38.280 --> 03:03:42.800]  police state justice for Thomas Kelly I forget is that is the name of the
[03:03:42.800 --> 03:03:47.040]  homeless person that was beat up by the police and well he was tortured slowly to
[03:03:47.040 --> 03:03:51.560]  death with pleasure yes so I think we should do a t-shirt like that make
[03:03:51.560 --> 03:03:56.120]  something you know make a bigger stink you know keep people thinking about that
[03:03:56.120 --> 03:04:01.000]  and not they think more about the tree I agree that would be a go by the way the
[03:04:01.000 --> 03:04:05.440]  Trayvon stuff came out turns out Zimmerman's nose was broken his head
[03:04:05.440 --> 03:04:10.640]  fractured and the autopsy of Trayvon his fists were busted as all the witnesses
[03:04:10.640 --> 03:04:14.480]  said and I'm not saying it's a good thing the guy got shot or that but I mean
[03:04:14.480 --> 03:04:17.840]  the point is Zimmerman's telling the truth and is gonna get in all this
[03:04:17.840 --> 03:04:25.520]  trouble yeah it's unfair I have a question I don't know if this is
[03:04:25.520 --> 03:04:30.280]  happening everywhere I live close to a military base it's called for Buchanan
[03:04:30.280 --> 03:04:38.000]  and they play the military trumpet every day at 6 a.m. 5 p.m. and 10 p.m. and they
[03:04:38.000 --> 03:04:42.200]  this is something that's begun like a year ago I think they're just getting us
[03:04:42.200 --> 03:04:46.760]  used to like military state you know no that's happening everywhere there's
[03:04:46.760 --> 03:04:50.480]  directives to acclimate the public it's one thing to have Reveley but now they
[03:04:50.480 --> 03:04:54.560]  have military patrolling outside bases all over the country and pulling over
[03:04:54.560 --> 03:05:18.920]  slaves that's us unbelievable thanks for the call from Puerto Rico
