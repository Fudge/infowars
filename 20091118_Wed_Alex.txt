[00:00.000 --> 00:11.600]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:11.600 --> 00:20.360]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.360 --> 00:33.040]  well the ADL has outdone themselves welcome ladies and gentlemen to this
[00:33.040 --> 00:43.580]  November 18th Wednesday edition 2009 as we accelerate into the depths of fall
[00:43.580 --> 00:50.680]  nearing a winter and the end of this this calendar year we can certainly pat
[00:50.680 --> 00:55.120]  ourselves on the back that we are making major headway against the globalist
[00:55.120 --> 01:00.400]  they have a lot of the big headcards and they've got the organization and the
[01:00.400 --> 01:07.600]  funds but the establishment is really starting to panic and try to bully the
[01:07.600 --> 01:13.600]  American people into shutting their mouths they're trying to issue a chilling
[01:13.600 --> 01:19.440]  effect edict that anyone that reads the New York Times when Ban Ki-moon the
[01:19.440 --> 01:26.080]  Secretary General of the UN calls for world government if you say there is a
[01:26.080 --> 01:29.200]  world government when you read it in hundreds of newspapers per day now
[01:29.200 --> 01:34.060]  literally every day hundreds per day go to Google type in world government new
[01:34.060 --> 01:41.320]  world order click Google news hundreds a day thousands a week 12,000 in one day
[01:41.320 --> 01:46.400]  back during the G20 12,000 articles calling for world government in the
[01:46.400 --> 01:55.840]  end of the dollar and carbon taxes and one child policies worldwide and if you
[01:55.840 --> 02:01.520]  come out and read out of the New York Times the ADL calls you an anti-Semite
[02:01.520 --> 02:09.840]  I mean this is insane but it's just like what Chris Matthews is doing and the
[02:09.840 --> 02:17.360]  other host on especially MSNBC but CNBC CNN Anderson Cooper does it if you say
[02:17.360 --> 02:22.400]  that Obama's policies are socialistic really they're a wealth transfer to the
[02:22.400 --> 02:25.960]  elite but on the surface it is socialistic Newsweek headline we're all
[02:25.960 --> 02:31.680]  socialists now remember that cover so they could admit it's socialist but then
[02:31.680 --> 02:38.000]  if you say hey I don't want to live under socialism it doesn't work too well
[02:38.000 --> 02:43.200]  Chris Matthews the ADL comes out an attraction ladies and gentlemen the ADL
[02:43.200 --> 02:50.360]  is now attacking Lou Dobbs Glenn Beck Michelle Malkin myself in the most
[02:50.360 --> 02:59.760]  savage attacks I have ever seen and CBS News coverage Jerusalem Post coverage
[02:59.760 --> 03:04.800]  scores of other newspapers are now running with it and here's what's really
[03:04.800 --> 03:07.360]  wild about it I'm gonna break it all down today and tell you about the guests
[03:07.360 --> 03:14.800]  that are coming up but this is big is that they have six new reports on the
[03:14.800 --> 03:25.800]  ADL website and I am listed in five of the reports as the arch enemy I am
[03:25.800 --> 03:31.640]  listed as powerful and incredibly popular and incredibly well I mean that's
[03:31.640 --> 03:35.960]  what the New Republic did they said I mesmerize people I mesmerize them you
[03:35.960 --> 03:39.080]  mean I go oh here's the New York Times saying world government we're gonna pay
[03:39.080 --> 03:44.760]  taxes to the UN oh I'm so mesmerizing I mean come on what's mesmerizing people
[03:44.760 --> 03:48.920]  is that the mainstream media demonized anybody that talked about this in the
[03:48.920 --> 03:54.120]  last 20 years and tried to attach anti-Semitism it's actually the government
[03:54.120 --> 03:58.920]  the ADL and the media that always jump into everything and and put it in
[03:58.920 --> 04:04.840]  people's minds that it's Jews and they know what they're doing so they can then
[04:04.840 --> 04:11.360]  demonize the movement against the globalist and keep mainline folks from
[04:11.360 --> 04:14.600]  joining it where you open the newspaper up and it says world government's
[04:14.600 --> 04:18.500]  being announced and it's good well late Alex Jones has said this for years but
[04:18.500 --> 04:21.920]  I better not talk about it because I'll be called an anti-Semite what does it
[04:21.920 --> 04:25.600]  have to do with that they're making it about that and that's why the federal
[04:25.600 --> 04:29.520]  government's been caught over and over and over again Southern Prairie Law

[10:24.360 --> 10:32.240]  George Humphrey and Catherine austin fits George Humphrey will be in studio
[10:35.000 --> 10:47.600]  my mind has been racing with all of the hypocrisy with all of the corruption and
[10:47.600 --> 10:53.280]  also with the exhilaration of the fact that we are certainly making headway
[10:53.280 --> 11:00.120]  against the new world order the the the humbling realization that this radio
[11:00.120 --> 11:06.560]  show in the films I make and the websites are now being recognized across the
[11:06.560 --> 11:16.560]  globe by mainstream media publications as the most substantial and virulent
[11:16.560 --> 11:24.520]  threat to their power structure the ADL has mirrored what has been said in the
[11:24.520 --> 11:29.360]  new republic and salon and in george soros publications but in a much more
[11:29.360 --> 11:35.800]  vicious format and they've declared me the conspiracy king incredibly powerful
[11:35.800 --> 11:43.400]  incredibly influential incredibly popular and I don't like that I'll be
[11:43.400 --> 11:49.760]  honest with you to have the eye of sauron staring directly at me when I'm
[11:49.760 --> 11:53.800]  trying to get the ring into the crack of doom it's a little hollywood analogy for
[11:53.800 --> 12:02.040]  folks it's not fun and I've been making the point the last six months or so that
[12:02.040 --> 12:06.680]  not just indicators in the media and from government but also dirty tricks
[12:06.680 --> 12:11.080]  being played on us whisper campaigns disinformation campaigns from all sides
[12:11.080 --> 12:20.240]  all angles it's creepy and then it was reported and then senator Lamar
[12:20.240 --> 12:23.400]  Alexander also spoke on the floor about this there is a White House enemies
[12:23.400 --> 12:30.040]  list I am in the top 25 names that's creepy I mean I never expected and I'm
[12:30.040 --> 12:33.160]  and I'm talking about this from my perspective because it's the best way
[12:33.160 --> 12:38.080]  for me to be able to relay it to you I never expected 14 years ago when I went
[12:38.080 --> 12:43.440]  down and started an access TV show in a broom closet I the size of a broom
[12:43.440 --> 12:47.160]  closet out of the control room I didn't have any crews that are out of the
[12:47.160 --> 12:54.200]  control room myself brought a camera in there I had no inkling no no delusions
[12:54.200 --> 13:00.600]  of grandeur nothing I couldn't watch myself on television I hated doing it
[13:00.600 --> 13:11.720]  hated it but I hated watching the Democrats go after my guns and I hated
[13:11.720 --> 13:17.360]  watching the city council steal old people's property with $1,000 a day
[13:17.360 --> 13:21.960]  fines for three inch grass by the way there's a big headline today in the
[13:21.960 --> 13:27.880]  news in Florida $1,000 a day fines for three inch grass funny because that's
[13:27.880 --> 13:33.640]  the point you can go see access TV shows I did in 96 when I would go out and
[13:33.640 --> 13:37.200]  interview the old people they were because they have databases they target
[13:37.200 --> 13:40.760]  old people when you go in the hospital and you've got cancer and they find out
[13:40.760 --> 13:44.320]  you live alone it gets filed with the health department that you're at risk
[13:44.320 --> 13:48.360]  and then that's given to special units in the city council and then they have
[13:48.360 --> 13:52.880]  special predatory units in the police department that help shake you down
[13:52.880 --> 13:57.120]  first code enforcement comes then the police come to your door ask if you have
[13:57.120 --> 14:01.040]  a problem and they beat you up they take you to jail that happened to Roland
[14:01.040 --> 14:09.000]  Ellingston I mean when I found out that they got that that the town where I
[14:09.000 --> 14:17.120]  live has predatory groups in the government that feed on weak people as a
[14:17.120 --> 14:26.320]  21 22 year old I got mad and all my instincts for war all my instincts for
[14:26.320 --> 14:29.400]  resistance are there for a reason it's to defend women and children and old
[14:29.400 --> 14:35.600]  people but they misplace our manhood into strutting around with high-powered
[14:35.600 --> 14:39.720]  weapons and camouflage and going and basically oppressing third-world cave
[14:39.720 --> 14:46.320]  men I'm not saying you're not tough I'm not saying you're not brave I'm telling
[14:46.320 --> 14:55.560]  you all those energies are being wasted more than wasted they're being abused and
[14:55.560 --> 15:00.760]  I'm I'm nothing special I'm just somebody that got angry and started
[15:00.760 --> 15:06.880]  studying I mean I was a mainline Republican slash Ron Paul libertarian
[15:06.880 --> 15:11.760]  when I first got started and then I learned more and more and more I mean I'd
[15:11.760 --> 15:17.080]  read books about the New World Order and I'd read none dare call conspiracy when
[15:17.080 --> 15:22.240]  I was in high school but it wasn't real I didn't disbelieve that it was just
[15:22.240 --> 15:28.360]  books I'd read I wasn't consciously acting on it I wasn't consciously
[15:28.360 --> 15:31.840]  looking through that lens but let me tell you something I found the New
[15:31.840 --> 15:38.120]  World Order right here in my town where I live I found police and government
[15:38.120 --> 15:44.360]  bureaucrats who mercilessly steal innocent people's children for no reason
[15:44.360 --> 15:48.680]  just to fill quotas and make money I watched them take ranchers and farmers
[15:48.680 --> 15:53.480]  property so that city council members could take control of it and make
[15:53.480 --> 16:00.200]  hundreds of millions of dollars selling it to build high-rise hotels and golf
[16:00.200 --> 16:06.880]  courses and subdivisions and I watched good police and bureaucrats and people
[16:06.880 --> 16:11.400]  right next to them with blinders on ignoring the evil that was happening
[16:11.400 --> 16:17.400]  right in front of their face through peer pressure so I want to say to the ADL
[16:17.400 --> 16:23.440]  before I start really breaking this down piece by piece and to the George Soros
[16:23.440 --> 16:27.560]  crowd and to the neocon crowd I mean they all attack me all the
[16:27.560 --> 16:37.440]  establishment attacks me the Nazis attack me the ADL it goes after me the
[16:37.440 --> 16:41.440]  just just every group I'm sure most of you out there have seen it there's a
[16:41.440 --> 16:45.880]  concerted campaign for years but it's intensifying and I knew it was gonna
[16:45.880 --> 16:51.720]  have the opposite effect because I understand I think better than some of
[16:51.720 --> 16:55.000]  the old fossils that are still running the new order system how the internet
[16:55.000 --> 17:00.360]  really works and I have confidence in my message and so I know all these
[17:00.360 --> 17:05.680]  demonization campaigns actually helped me because people want to go check out
[17:05.680 --> 17:10.400]  this Alex Jones they want to find out what all the hubbub is about and then
[17:10.400 --> 17:14.960]  they find out the true message and intellectually and in their gut and in
[17:14.960 --> 17:19.920]  their spirit they know I'm bonafide and for real warts and all I'm not perfect
[17:19.920 --> 17:24.640]  but they know the real deal because you're the real deal out there and you're
[17:24.640 --> 17:33.280]  the real power of this radio show now a lot of the old globalist are dying off
[17:33.280 --> 17:38.720]  or retiring and handing it over to the next room who still are intelligent and
[17:38.720 --> 17:46.880]  sophisticated and have even smarter people under them who are young than a
[17:46.880 --> 17:50.960]  total evolution in media and culture and everything and then they've been
[17:50.960 --> 17:56.080]  advising them for years that I am extremely dangerous to them and that
[17:56.080 --> 17:59.400]  we and that we shouldn't just be ignored that we should be demonized and
[17:59.400 --> 18:01.880]  smashed
[18:01.880 --> 18:10.240]  but I've seen a change in the attacks not just the massive intensification but
[18:10.240 --> 18:23.840]  a major shift from just throwing a wall of noise and lies up they've now stopped
[18:23.840 --> 18:28.000]  that bombardment and are now shifting to a new bombardment saying this guy is
[18:28.000 --> 18:34.880]  dangerous and can cause a revolution he needs to be dealt with and just like in
[18:34.880 --> 18:39.400]  the final scene of the body snatchers from the 1970s where the lady walks up

[24:05.320 --> 24:10.320]  hi Alex this is Noah from Houston it seems to me that the NSA's one of the
[24:10.320 --> 24:15.760]  primary objectives is to secure the technological monopoly of the globalists
[24:15.760 --> 24:20.320]  by developing cutting-edge technology through DARPA and then when the time is
[24:20.320 --> 24:24.640]  right allowing that technology to be patented by one of their global
[24:24.640 --> 24:29.480]  corporations that is in the military industrial complex in which they own my
[24:29.480 --> 24:36.120]  question is a is this an accurate accurate assessment of the NSA b is one
[24:36.120 --> 24:41.760]  of their primary objectives to secure this technological monopoly by not
[24:41.760 --> 24:46.880]  allowing technologies to be developed within the private sector and see what
[24:46.880 --> 24:51.480]  can we do to combat this effectively because in my opinion that is as big as
[24:51.480 --> 24:55.800]  their financial monopoly and their media monopoly is their technological
[24:55.800 --> 25:05.480]  monopoly thank you I'm in favor of you genics you take a walk down a trip down
[25:05.480 --> 25:11.560]  to your local Walmart and look around and about 99 of the percent of the people
[25:11.560 --> 25:16.720]  are people that you do not want to be breeding and having babies thank you
[25:16.720 --> 25:19.200]  goodbye
[25:21.760 --> 25:33.160]  that's the new info wars radio comment line 5126464444 we're playing those each
[25:33.160 --> 25:39.400]  and every day Monday through Sunday we're on the radio six days a week I'm
[25:39.400 --> 25:48.200]  going to address CBS Nightly News the Jerusalem Post the ADL that all tried to
[25:48.200 --> 25:54.840]  savage yours truly yesterday I want to break down the entire paradigm coming
[25:54.840 --> 26:02.720]  up in the next segment but commenting on those two calls here in my stack I have
[26:02.720 --> 26:08.760]  a mainstream news article stating that the National Security Agency is offering
[26:08.760 --> 26:15.640]  Microsoft a patch for Windows and it's come out in federal court many times
[26:15.640 --> 26:20.880]  that backdoors have been built in all the major software systems occasionally a
[26:20.880 --> 26:28.320]  new encryption comes out or a new form of communication comes out and the CIA the
[26:28.320 --> 26:34.200]  FBI Interpol in Europe go after the groups sometimes taking them over
[26:34.200 --> 26:41.040]  sometimes even killing the CEOs if they refused to hand it over and then issue a
[26:41.040 --> 26:45.480]  new version with a back door in it remember I told you over a decade ago
[26:45.480 --> 26:49.000]  that on-star is used to dial in and listen to you in your car that's now
[26:49.000 --> 26:52.800]  mainstream news told you 96 that your cell phones are being used they dial in
[26:52.800 --> 26:55.960]  and listen even when they're off under federal law they're designed to do that
[26:55.960 --> 26:58.800]  under federal law actually international law but the feds have
[26:58.800 --> 27:04.000]  complied it's now mainstream news again all I'm doing is telling you what's in
[27:04.000 --> 27:09.000]  the documents so yes there are at least 30 years advanced in many forms of
[27:09.000 --> 27:15.720]  technology they roll them out through select corporations IBM is a government
[27:15.720 --> 27:20.920]  front that's come out in declassified reports they were afraid of the
[27:20.920 --> 27:26.360]  chairman antitrust laws in the 70s and early 80s so they set up Bill Gates
[27:26.360 --> 27:29.200]  whose father was the head of Planned Parenthood and have been an army
[27:29.200 --> 27:37.360]  intelligence to give Bill Gates his own duopoly or oligopoly it's a cartel and
[27:37.360 --> 27:45.240]  so yes the world has adopted their grid notice I can was private but DARPA gave
[27:45.240 --> 27:51.280]  them that the registration domain name system now that was given to the United
[27:51.280 --> 28:00.800]  Nations via ICANN a month ago so the US in 45 set up the UN and then they have
[28:00.800 --> 28:07.560]  the UN absorb the United States by US the powerful interest in the US the
[28:07.560 --> 28:11.920]  United States created the internet and then gave it to the world if you believe
[28:11.920 --> 28:17.520]  that and so just as they give the world the mass technologies that have their
[28:17.520 --> 28:22.560]  back doors they sell the public cell phones that you pay money for that
[28:22.560 --> 28:25.200]  then track and trace everything you do and control your life your little
[28:25.200 --> 28:30.720]  personal computer that you carry around with you that creates a psychological
[28:30.720 --> 28:39.160]  algorithm a psychological profile of your personality type this is the data
[28:39.160 --> 28:42.920]  management system and again I would tell people about this 10 12 years ago
[28:42.920 --> 28:49.600]  because I would read it in science publications in trade publications of
[28:49.600 --> 28:53.680]  high-tech Silicon Valley Pentagon announcements a defense contractor
[28:53.680 --> 28:57.200]  announcements I mean Google announced five years ago they're using the audio
[28:57.200 --> 29:03.840]  mics and video cameras standard on all new computers now to watch you and
[29:03.840 --> 29:08.720]  listen to you but they said don't worry we're only using computers to do that and
[29:08.720 --> 29:14.120]  then we have ads pop up on the screen so it isn't just where you visit and you

[37:04.560 --> 37:16.000]  should I go over these reports where they lie and say that I'm making it up
[37:16.000 --> 37:33.600]  that in Arcadia that in Arcadia in the Midwest that the Pentagon announced in
[37:33.600 --> 37:36.800]  the local paper they were going to do a gun confiscation drill I mean they had
[37:36.800 --> 37:40.920]  a sergeant in the paper saying we're going to do a drill where the gun shop
[37:40.920 --> 37:45.480]  dealer sold guns illegally and we're going to go door-to-door asking people
[37:45.480 --> 37:51.880]  to search their homes I'm not the one that wrote that then they go and imply
[37:51.880 --> 38:02.880]  that I'm going to cause a violent attack on police and military all I did was
[38:02.880 --> 38:12.720]  read the quotes out of the newspaper they're hoping you don't go read that
[38:12.720 --> 38:18.080]  newspaper and Paul Watson said a general piece is gonna do other pieces that go
[38:18.080 --> 38:21.360]  through the distortions and disinformation they have a whole nother
[38:21.360 --> 38:28.880]  report actually two reports where they talk about how I'm running around telling
[38:28.880 --> 38:33.200]  everyone that a world government's forming and then a world government is
[38:33.200 --> 38:40.280]  going to come and get us and that it's run by big banks well there's a problem
[38:40.280 --> 38:46.240]  ADL there's a problem CBS news there's a problem Jerusalem post there's a
[38:46.240 --> 38:55.040]  problem salon there's a problem New Republic there's a problem White House
[38:55.040 --> 38:59.920]  we're in the top 25 of the White House enemies list that's been confirmed
[38:59.920 --> 39:06.280]  mainstream media reports we've covered here the problem is every day if you go
[39:06.280 --> 39:11.840]  to a major search engine and type in the term New World Order and or world
[39:11.840 --> 39:17.680]  government or global government or death of the dollar or carbon tax you will
[39:17.680 --> 39:23.120]  get hundreds and hundreds of new stories per day now here's a few famous
[39:23.120 --> 39:28.000]  ones where they're particularly honest one of them is written by Gideon
[39:28.000 --> 39:32.120]  Reitman one of the editors at the Financial Times of London I'm sorry ADL
[39:32.120 --> 39:39.400]  the Financial Times of London does exist the headline is and now for world
[39:39.400 --> 39:47.440]  government and he goes on to say yes we need an authoritarian world government
[39:47.440 --> 39:52.240]  and yes we kept it secret from you for your own good I mean go read the article
[39:52.240 --> 40:00.160]  so I'm bad and this arch devil I've got to basically wear a yellow star it's
[40:00.160 --> 40:03.560]  like I'm in Nazi Germany they're saying we've got to be tracked we've got to be
[40:03.560 --> 40:09.320]  traced we've got to be put on no fly list we've got to you know have these
[40:09.320 --> 40:13.880]  Homeland Security and Mayak reports that we broke here written by the Southern
[40:13.880 --> 40:16.800]  Property Law Center and ADL that it's all pulled word for word from their
[40:16.800 --> 40:21.440]  reports where Homeland Security admits internally their whole reason for
[40:21.440 --> 40:25.840]  existing is the American people gun owners libertarians veterans conservatives
[40:25.840 --> 40:28.880]  people that don't like the private Federal Reserve people don't want to cut
[40:28.880 --> 40:33.520]  their taxes we're allowed in America to have our political views that just so
[40:33.520 --> 40:36.680]  happened to line up with the Bill of Rights and Constitution and Declaration
[40:36.680 --> 40:42.480]  of Independence you're the bad guys and they have all these articles of flotilla
[40:42.480 --> 40:47.440]  of them yesterday saying it's bad and it's evil to be angry it's bad and the
[40:47.440 --> 40:56.080]  Tea Parties are bad England Beck is bad and Michelle Malkin is bad and I mean
[40:56.080 --> 41:06.360]  just basically that that everybody everybody is bad who questions anything
[41:06.360 --> 41:12.120]  and that it's un-American that we be involved in communities and that we be
[41:12.120 --> 41:16.200]  marching and that the American people stand up and say we're not turning our
[41:16.200 --> 41:21.000]  guns in and particularly upset about the three percenters as they call
[41:21.000 --> 41:27.680]  themselves a lot of the military wearing those patches now in country the
[41:27.680 --> 41:33.760]  Oathkeepers they are really concerned about the military and police rediscovering
[41:33.760 --> 41:38.560]  who they really are who they should be and the police are feeling good and the
[41:38.560 --> 41:42.360]  military are feeling good about themselves becoming true Americans
[41:42.360 --> 41:47.240]  again rediscovering who their ancestors are what their birthright is what their
[41:47.240 --> 41:53.320]  family name means people that have felt horrible for years because
[41:53.320 --> 41:57.560]  subconsciously they know they're part of a bad system even if they themselves do
[41:57.560 --> 42:02.880]  a lot of good they know the systems rotten and things are out of control and
[42:02.880 --> 42:14.240]  they're upset and they're upset that veterans are reaching out to active duty
[42:14.240 --> 42:18.240]  people and that we're waking them up and that it's spreading like wildfire and
[42:18.240 --> 42:23.720]  they admit it's happening the establishment admits that they're
[42:23.720 --> 42:38.200]  losing the fight against us the peaceful fight I mean this is two weeks ago we
[42:38.200 --> 42:45.040]  can do it New York Times Ban Ki-moon he exists he is the UN Secretary General
[42:45.040 --> 42:54.080]  the UN exist go over there to the east side of Manhattan you could see it for
[42:54.080 --> 43:00.720]  yourself and he calls for global government in this article
[43:05.160 --> 43:09.400]  force from the last paragraph a deal must include an equitable global
[43:09.400 --> 43:15.120]  governance structure all countries must be involved in deciding how the resource
[43:15.120 --> 43:20.760]  are deployed manage the UN will control it but they'll listen to you they
[43:20.760 --> 43:26.640]  promise and they discuss in this article written by the UN Secretary General
[43:26.640 --> 43:34.360]  how the UN will tax and regulate every facet of your life now hundreds of
[43:34.360 --> 43:38.440]  these articles a day at the point where the establishment is announcing their
[43:38.440 --> 43:43.240]  global government takeover their carbon tax the IMF to be the private center of
[43:43.240 --> 43:47.160]  the new world government run by private interest will be paying your taxes to
[43:47.160 --> 43:52.560]  Al Gore they call that a conspiracy 33 years ago he now admits it they'll be
[43:52.560 --> 43:57.360]  buying carbon carbon credits from him the UN will decide who can sell carbon
[43:57.360 --> 44:00.800]  credits and give it to all their little insider bodies I mean this is a new form
[44:00.800 --> 44:09.240]  of royalty and you can't expect the American people to just sit here while
[44:09.240 --> 44:20.120]  you do this and do nothing you can't expect the people of the world to sit
[44:20.120 --> 44:28.160]  back while financial illegitimate criminal interest conquer us now why is
[44:28.160 --> 44:34.280]  the ADL and southern poverty law centers the favorite vehicles by the private
[44:34.280 --> 44:37.920]  corporate networks that control government the police the military to go
[44:37.920 --> 44:42.360]  between government the federal government international government state and
[44:42.360 --> 44:46.680]  local government why are they the favorite well because that's basically a
[44:46.680 --> 44:50.240]  foreign intelligence operation on record they've been caught breaking into
[44:50.240 --> 44:54.080]  police stations moles and police stations stealing police files to create
[44:54.080 --> 44:59.520]  private files on people it's a Mossad operation now why is the Mossad used for
[44:59.520 --> 45:05.080]  this all the British intelligence US intelligence and Israeli intelligence all
[45:05.080 --> 45:10.840]  work for each other with each other and they admit that they have US spy spy on
[45:10.840 --> 45:16.520]  the brits for the brits British spy spy on the US for the US it's admitted the
[45:16.520 --> 45:21.320]  NSA's main snooping arms are in England that's how they would get around the
[45:21.320 --> 45:25.480]  federal laws previously and vice versa with Israel that's how they have another
[45:25.480 --> 45:30.240]  layer of plausible deniability plus you don't end up having an agent spying on
[45:30.240 --> 45:38.040]  their own family or someone who they support or someone they know so you
[45:38.040 --> 45:43.680]  have a group that's been caught been arrested before infiltrating police
[45:43.680 --> 45:50.480]  departments well now they just publicly run them and anytime you say oh I don't
[45:50.480 --> 45:55.920]  want a socialist health care plan MSNBC singing in they all say oh racism you
[45:55.920 --> 46:02.160]  hate black people that's so black people and Hispanics think now if this is what
[46:02.160 --> 46:06.360]  they're trying to sell it hasn't worked it's multifaceted they're telling black
[46:06.360 --> 46:10.040]  people in Hispanics if you care about your race your group you've got to be
[46:10.040 --> 46:18.720]  for big government socialism you know free markets a old white man thing you
[46:18.720 --> 46:21.880]  know let the bankers enslave you we'll take good care of you here on the
[46:21.880 --> 46:32.560]  reservation but it's also for guilty white people who believe me aren't racist
[46:32.560 --> 46:35.600]  most of them are just worshipful of anybody who isn't white they hate
[46:35.600 --> 46:41.880]  themselves they believe whites are scum and filth believe me I'm white I know
[46:41.880 --> 46:45.240]  that makes them go well I better not be against the health care plan I don't want
[46:45.240 --> 46:53.120]  to be called a Nazi because I'm against socialism what does calling someone a
[46:53.120 --> 46:56.560]  socialist when Newsweek had the cover story we're all socialists now see when
[46:56.560 --> 47:00.040]  they're saying socialism's good it's okay to say it you're not a racist but if
[47:00.040 --> 47:06.440]  you say it you go I don't want it oh you don't like black people it's in my film
[47:06.440 --> 47:20.520]  fall the Republic clip after clip after clip of the news saying oh look at the
[47:20.520 --> 47:24.720]  tea parties they don't like Obama look at this woman she's a racist Chris
[47:24.720 --> 47:32.240]  Matthews that Carlos Watson guy black guy period you are a racist no sir you're
[47:32.240 --> 47:40.640]  worse than a racist mr. Watson you're worse than a racist mr. Slime Bowl
[47:40.640 --> 47:46.080]  Chris Matthews because you consciously are using divide and conquer you know
[47:46.080 --> 47:49.960]  you're manipulating people you're trying to get blacks and whites everybody else
[47:49.960 --> 47:55.760]  fighting with each other for your own political gain you're cold-bloodedly
[47:55.760 --> 47:59.200]  hijacking this country and taking over every sector of the economy and right
[47:59.200 --> 48:02.440]  out in the middle of nowhere when no one's even thinking or talking about
[48:02.440 --> 48:11.160]  race you come right into the middle of the situation and drop it in the middle
[48:11.160 --> 48:14.800]  of the party drop a stink bomb right in the middle of the party and say oh you
[48:14.800 --> 48:18.280]  don't like black people you don't like Hispanics to get every one of each
[48:18.280 --> 48:22.600]  other's throats and that's what the ADL does I mean I don't like Michelle
[48:22.600 --> 48:26.600]  Malcolm she's a worshiper of torture and war and corruption and by the way of
[48:26.600 --> 48:31.840]  Israel not good enough she's against socialism and the elites want that so
[48:31.840 --> 48:37.560]  she's demonized right alongside me Lou Dobbs talks about the North American
[48:37.560 --> 48:44.800]  Union run out of his job he's demonized right next to me but they say I'm the
[48:44.800 --> 48:48.200]  chief enemy and why because I understand the game and I'm teaching people the
[48:48.200 --> 48:53.440]  game and showing them how these people are operating and so Hitler was
[48:53.440 --> 49:00.160]  certainly bad and did kill a lot of people and was a bad guy and so here I
[49:00.160 --> 49:08.320]  am the grandson of two men who were in World War two volunteered for their
[49:08.320 --> 49:13.080]  country and I get to be lumped in I'm now Hitler see they get to move that
[49:13.080 --> 49:18.000]  black spot in European history and over and put it on Alex Jones was nothing to
[49:18.000 --> 49:23.200]  do with it and just say oh we're the ADL we fight Nazis look Alex Jones
[49:23.200 --> 49:27.760]  doesn't like socialism they say that in these articles they say that in CBS they
[49:27.760 --> 49:32.440]  say the Jerusalem post if you don't like big government you are a Nazi and
[49:32.440 --> 49:37.880]  you're dangerous and you want violence doesn't matter that nine times out of
[49:37.880 --> 49:42.640]  ten when a synagogue or a dormitory or an NAACP gets a swastika spray painted on
[49:42.640 --> 49:46.160]  it people the police end up locally because the police are getting wise
[49:46.160 --> 49:52.360]  shutting up hidden cameras and catching the local black or Jewish students out
[49:52.360 --> 49:57.320]  there doing game over folks you understand it's now come out in the
[49:57.320 --> 50:02.000]  Miami Papers it's now come out in the Boston Globe over and over again top
[50:02.000 --> 50:07.280]  Nazis Hal Turner top Nazi rallies in Florida everywhere they're always feds
[50:07.280 --> 50:11.400]  they're run by feds and those are the groups all attacking Alex Jones people
[50:11.400 --> 50:14.720]  aren't stupid they're gonna wait the Nazis all hate Alex Jones I mean they
[50:14.720 --> 50:18.240]  spend literally on the web I'm probably the number one person attacked by
[50:18.240 --> 50:24.160]  Nazis they're not really Nazis they're feds they sick the mindless idiot
[50:24.160 --> 50:30.320]  followers they're bigoted followers on us separately I have the ADL and Southern
[50:30.320 --> 50:39.240]  Poverty Law Center now saying I'm the number one threat you understand now and
[50:39.240 --> 50:46.080]  so by trying to save someone's an anti-Semite and they don't say that about
[50:46.080 --> 50:50.720]  me they just mix me in with them but by doing that they hope to demonize anyone
[50:50.720 --> 50:54.640]  being politically involved lest you be singled out by the ADL it's an attempt
[50:54.640 --> 51:02.320]  to chill your free speech and shut you up so you'll accept the bondage this is
[51:02.320 --> 51:06.400]  an emergency alert more than half the world's doctors and nurses are

[54:08.000 --> 54:13.400]  as bad as this is on the surface to have Chris Matthews coming out and saying if
[54:13.400 --> 54:20.760]  you criticize Obama in any way you are a cross-burning Klansman as bad as it is
[54:20.760 --> 54:27.360]  to have the ADL blowing the trumpet and saying Alex Jones is enemy number one
[54:27.360 --> 54:32.920]  as bad as that is it shows that the establishment is getting scared and they
[54:32.920 --> 54:36.600]  admit in these articles that we're reaching tens of millions of people that
[54:36.600 --> 54:44.600]  we are incredibly popular that's a quote and that we're growing see I can look
[54:44.600 --> 54:48.400]  at our own growth curve internally. Ladies and gentlemen I can get off
[54:48.400 --> 54:53.000]  airplanes in Canada in England in Central America anywhere in the US now I
[54:53.000 --> 54:56.560]  can walk down any Main Street and cars start stopping and people getting out
[54:56.560 --> 55:01.480]  going Alex Jones Alex Jones I'm a listener I mean we are huge huge and
[55:01.480 --> 55:06.160]  it's been completely underground and they've tried to ignore us like Gandhi
[55:06.160 --> 55:12.640]  said first they ignore you then they attack you then you win they have been
[55:12.640 --> 55:16.560]  trying to ignore us hoping it would go away and now they're saying okay this
[55:16.560 --> 55:20.840]  guy is dangerous no I'm not dangerous I'm not the one putting poisons in the
[55:20.840 --> 55:25.240]  water supply mainstream news admits okay it's admitted it's in there I'm not the
[55:25.240 --> 55:28.800]  one feeding people GMO food I'm not the one telling the public there's no
[55:28.800 --> 55:32.160]  mercury in the vaccines when you read the insert and it's in there I'm just
[55:32.160 --> 55:35.880]  pointing out all the lies the people have found out that the media and the
[55:35.880 --> 55:43.320]  government are a bunch of liars and so hey ADL great write more articles saying
[55:43.320 --> 55:46.320]  I'm making up that there's a world government and they try little tricks
[55:46.320 --> 55:49.600]  and they're like Jones says a lot of different groups he doesn't know which
[55:49.600 --> 55:53.080]  one's running it one day it's the Bilderberg group next it's the
[55:53.080 --> 55:58.120]  trilateral Commission next it's the CFR next is the fellow reserve who runs the
[55:58.120 --> 56:02.480]  Bilderberg group CFR trilateral Commission fellow reserve bank it's like
[56:02.480 --> 56:06.320]  six guys they're the heads of all those groups those are different management
[56:06.320 --> 56:09.680]  arms and a corporate structure they write textbooks the government does
[56:09.680 --> 56:12.800]  bragging about it so they're high-level government executives and
[56:12.800 --> 56:20.040]  technicians can understand what's going on I mean do you understand you can't
[56:20.040 --> 56:27.560]  continue to just say none of this exists and they're not stupid they're trying to
[56:27.560 --> 56:31.760]  create a chilling effect saying it doesn't matter if it exists you only say
[56:31.760 --> 56:37.360]  it exists Jones if it's good you don't come out and say it's bad or we're gonna
[56:37.360 --> 56:43.080]  come after you do you understand you as an American citizen are not allowed to
[56:43.080 --> 56:50.040]  speak out against the Kinley Bernard Madoff types because that's when those
[56:50.040 --> 56:53.360]  guys are pulled from the highest ranks of the very same crew running things
[56:53.360 --> 56:57.200]  they're all a bunch of crooks Goldman Sachs all of it and the reason they're
[56:57.200 --> 56:59.360]  really scared of me is because I'm going after the fellow reserve and I'm
[56:59.360 --> 57:04.600]  pointing out bypass the Democrats bypass the Republicans this is the key we are
[57:04.600 --> 57:09.480]  bringing people unity we are telling you whether you're black white Hispanic
[57:09.480 --> 57:16.240]  old young the New World Order wants you to be disenfranchised independent on
[57:16.240 --> 57:23.960]  them and institutionalized and they want you to be totally controlled they we
[57:23.960 --> 57:26.920]  read the UN documents on air where they openly state they want to lower our
[57:26.920 --> 57:34.840]  standard of living to control us and so we're here pointing that out bringing
[57:34.840 --> 57:38.360]  people together under premise principles of liberty and freedom and true
[57:38.360 --> 57:44.800]  free market and the system doesn't want that and so their job is to make all
[57:44.800 --> 57:48.920]  political discourse about race and religion to get us all fighting with
[57:48.920 --> 57:53.640]  each other they are the purveyors and just like Chris Matthews wants to keep
[57:53.640 --> 57:58.480]  black people as the property of the Democratic Party by invoking race and
[57:58.480 --> 58:01.800]  telling them racist or everywhere that want to get them if you say the word
[58:01.800 --> 58:07.600]  socialism that that's code for wanting to burn or shoot or lynch black people
[58:07.600 --> 58:12.680]  the ADL wants to keep Jews on the reservation they want to keep Jews
[58:12.680 --> 58:17.640]  scared Jews thinking everyone's after them they want to make it where when
[58:17.640 --> 58:22.720]  Jews here on the radio New World Order oh that's code for me see they're
[58:22.720 --> 58:28.080]  always inserting the word Jew into these debates that you know the word black
[58:28.080 --> 58:33.120]  into the debates this is race baiting this is religion baiting this is how
[58:33.120 --> 58:38.000]  the great game is played this is how we are controlled I'll finish up with this

[1:07:13.080 --> 1:07:17.600]  turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really
[1:07:17.600 --> 1:07:22.400]  are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[1:07:22.400 --> 1:07:26.760]  citizens to pay attention. Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[1:07:26.760 --> 1:07:32.040]  nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on

[1:08:25.720 --> 1:08:28.880]  going to continue getting into the economy a bunch of other news I haven't

[1:08:35.840 --> 1:08:41.680]  hit pieces where they're openly saying I'm gonna cause a violent revolution and
[1:08:41.680 --> 1:08:45.720]  I'm dangerous when we're not even calling for violent revolution so it's
[1:08:45.720 --> 1:08:52.240]  pretty spooky. Dr. Paul Craig Roberts is the John M. Olin fellow at the Institute

[1:10:03.600 --> 1:10:08.400]  getting much faster and much louder to abandon the dollar IMF head says global
[1:10:08.400 --> 1:10:13.960]  currency change needed presses to move to the yen the yawn as the World Reserve
[1:10:13.960 --> 1:10:19.280]  currency we've that's out of Reuters we've got open announcements of this
[1:10:19.280 --> 1:10:23.680]  happening but Bernanke says he's not too worried about it what will it mean if
[1:10:23.680 --> 1:10:27.800]  they continue to devalue the dollars in a 15 month low right now gold went up to
[1:10:27.800 --> 1:10:33.520]  $1,150 an ounce today in futures is trading even higher with no end in
[1:10:33.520 --> 1:10:37.120]  sight and now the mainstream media admits gold is going up because the
[1:10:37.120 --> 1:10:41.080]  dollar is being devalued amongst other things so top economist and journalist
[1:10:41.080 --> 1:10:45.760]  dr. Paul Craig Roberts good to have you here okay Alex good to be with you okay
[1:10:45.760 --> 1:10:50.480]  break it down for us what we're facing and in you know talk to me like I'm a
[1:10:50.480 --> 1:10:54.880]  six-year-old seven-year-old break down I mean it's one thing to talk about this
[1:10:54.880 --> 1:11:00.680]  three four years ago with you coming now to see it actually unfolding it's
[1:11:00.680 --> 1:11:08.960]  amazing yes it is isn't it I think what what made the whole world realize that
[1:11:08.960 --> 1:11:15.120]  the dollar was in its death row is that both the budget deficit and the trade
[1:11:15.120 --> 1:11:23.720]  deficit are so large they cannot be closed by conventional means and since
[1:11:23.720 --> 1:11:31.400]  there's no possibility of closing the budget or trade deficit the rest of the
[1:11:31.400 --> 1:11:38.280]  world sees that to continue to rely on the dollar as reserve currency which
[1:11:38.280 --> 1:11:46.880]  means of course it has to be a store of value if it's not a store of value or
[1:11:46.880 --> 1:11:53.440]  you don't want it in your country running a central bank you don't want your
[1:11:53.440 --> 1:11:59.440]  reserves of your nation stored in something that's not a store of value
[1:11:59.440 --> 1:12:05.120]  and since the dollar is losing value and since the rest of the world doesn't see
[1:12:05.120 --> 1:12:12.240]  any way to stop it from losing value because the trade deficit is now so
[1:12:12.240 --> 1:12:18.560]  wide the budget deficit is so wide they're all looking for an alternative
[1:12:18.560 --> 1:12:25.760]  before the class because otherwise all of the international payment mechanism
[1:12:25.760 --> 1:12:32.360]  would be at risk how would they settle their account to one another when the
[1:12:32.360 --> 1:12:37.700]  dollar goes belly up so everyone is talking about it they're trying to get
[1:12:37.700 --> 1:12:45.040]  attention they're trying to figure out what to do and I don't know what what
[1:12:45.040 --> 1:12:52.880]  the solution will be it may be that there won't be a reserve currency that
[1:12:52.880 --> 1:12:57.640]  countries with strong currencies will settle with each other in their own
[1:12:57.640 --> 1:13:09.680]  currency it may take some time for a new system to arrive John Maynard King at
[1:13:09.680 --> 1:13:17.440]  the end of World War II he had a proposal which did not require a reserve
[1:13:17.440 --> 1:13:25.800]  currency if you ran a surplus you had to put it you had to take off-setting
[1:13:25.800 --> 1:13:31.600]  action to get rid of it if you ran a deficit you had to take off-setting
[1:13:31.600 --> 1:13:36.680]  actions otherwise it was subject to fine I don't know whether they'll bring
[1:13:36.680 --> 1:13:45.280]  something like that into play or not but the dollar is certainly losing its
[1:13:45.280 --> 1:13:53.080]  value despite the fact that most other countries are intervening to support the
[1:13:53.080 --> 1:13:59.120]  dollar because they don't want their currency to rise so much the twist go
[1:13:59.120 --> 1:14:05.320]  in and buy a dollar to Chinese buy a dollar to Japanese buy a dollar all of
[1:14:05.320 --> 1:14:11.480]  these countries are supporting the dollar by spending their own currencies
[1:14:11.480 --> 1:14:20.560]  to buy it and it's still falling so this tells you that it's a bad situation for
[1:14:20.560 --> 1:14:26.440]  the dollar no one other thing Alex here in the short run the dollar could go
[1:14:26.440 --> 1:14:33.880]  back up because the low interest rate in United States means that the dollar is
[1:14:33.880 --> 1:14:42.280]  being used for the carry trade like the Japanese yen was the last few years you
[1:14:42.280 --> 1:14:47.960]  can borrow in the United States at low rates and then you take that money and
[1:14:47.960 --> 1:14:55.040]  you invested in a higher yielding foreign asset and so they're getting
[1:14:55.040 --> 1:15:00.680]  another bubble going on that bubble burst everybody has to unwind the carry
[1:15:00.680 --> 1:15:06.280]  trade which means they have to demand dollars to pay back the dollar loan so
[1:15:06.280 --> 1:15:13.920]  we could have a flip up in the dollar when this current stock market bubble
[1:15:13.920 --> 1:15:23.080]  burst and they have to unwind the carry trade but the downward trend is is in
[1:15:23.080 --> 1:15:28.880]  place and there's really nothing to reverse it you think about the deficit
[1:15:28.880 --> 1:15:37.600]  this year is four times larger than last year the deficit for fiscal year 2010 is
[1:15:37.600 --> 1:15:46.600]  also supposed to be four times larger than 2008 these are massive some that
[1:15:46.600 --> 1:15:54.440]  have to be financed and the budget deficit greatly exceeds the trade
[1:15:54.440 --> 1:16:01.120]  surplus of our so-called trading partner so even if they recycle all the dollars
[1:16:01.120 --> 1:16:06.400]  they earn from their trade purposes it still doesn't cover our budget deficit
[1:16:06.400 --> 1:16:14.680]  so the likelihood is that they'll have to print money or print more money which
[1:16:14.680 --> 1:16:22.040]  will tend to spend the dollar yet lower so there you have a very disturbing
[1:16:22.040 --> 1:16:26.800]  picture that doesn't seem to have any long-term solution and that's my next
[1:16:26.800 --> 1:16:33.120]  question again just in layman's terms there is a method to the madness I mean
[1:16:33.120 --> 1:16:36.480]  I know for you an economist who used to run the Treasury Department it's it's
[1:16:36.480 --> 1:16:39.600]  hard to reconcile people this destructive but it's even come out that
[1:16:39.600 --> 1:16:44.240]  Goldman Sachs was telling people by housing when they were actually secretly
[1:16:44.240 --> 1:16:47.800]  betting against it and that they were doing this to destroy their competition
[1:16:47.800 --> 1:16:52.360]  to make giant profits so for this inner group they're making record profits and
[1:16:52.360 --> 1:16:58.880]  consolidating the economy Main Street is dying real inflation is you know in
[1:16:58.880 --> 1:17:02.160]  check to some point I want to ask you how long that will last but real
[1:17:02.160 --> 1:17:09.000]  unemployment mostly indexes shows above 20 not 10 like they're saying and so how
[1:17:09.000 --> 1:17:15.240]  long can this delusional statement of jobless recovery continue as the real
[1:17:15.240 --> 1:17:21.320]  economy dies and as the bankers the inner group roll around in buckets of gold
[1:17:21.320 --> 1:17:30.120]  and palaces of wealth I mean it's in I mean they obviously know what they're
[1:17:30.120 --> 1:17:33.760]  doing because they're making all the big profits out of this and meanwhile I
[1:17:33.760 --> 1:17:38.160]  have stacks of mainstream news where suddenly mainline armies is being
[1:17:38.160 --> 1:17:41.400]  deployed in the streets of America that's coming up later I mean the picture
[1:17:41.400 --> 1:17:47.760]  I'm trying to paint here is what I see it's just it's so diabolical or are you
[1:17:47.760 --> 1:17:51.120]  just saying they're so greedy and corrupt they're just like pirates
[1:17:51.120 --> 1:18:00.480]  snatching goods out of the burning ship yeah you know I'm not even sure there's more enough to know burning I just
[1:18:00.480 --> 1:18:07.880]  certainly agree with you that Goldman Sachs and the banks are putting their
[1:18:07.880 --> 1:18:14.880]  short-term profits above everything else and they're ruining their own future
[1:18:14.880 --> 1:18:20.440]  because you know what the dollar is not the reserve currency of Wall Street
[1:18:20.440 --> 1:18:26.160]  investment bank doesn't have anything like the power or influence that it that
[1:18:26.160 --> 1:18:34.000]  it has had so by focusing on their short-term profits and it is a form of
[1:18:34.000 --> 1:18:43.400]  plunder and looting because the profits are are coming at the expense of other
[1:18:43.400 --> 1:18:51.040]  people it's not a win-win trading situation so the fact that they're so
[1:18:51.040 --> 1:18:59.480]  short-term in their outlook means they're contributing to the decline that
[1:18:59.480 --> 1:19:05.520]  we've been that we've been talking about and so they're going to end up going
[1:19:05.520 --> 1:19:15.720]  down to and and they're also losing their credibility and the trust of
[1:19:15.720 --> 1:19:22.880]  financial institutions in other countries which will make it harder and
[1:19:22.880 --> 1:19:31.120]  harder for them to function and do business so I don't know if they actually
[1:19:31.120 --> 1:19:39.840]  have a plot or a plan I think they're just grabbing and they've been doing
[1:19:39.840 --> 1:19:46.520]  this when they started getting the regulation again hot debt leverage
[1:19:46.520 --> 1:19:51.320]  repeal all right doctor stay there we're gonna come back and I've got a few
[1:19:51.320 --> 1:19:56.160]  other questions along this line because it's obviously so important and I'm gonna

[1:22:33.380 --> 1:22:37.560]  capitalism or was Jefferson correct when he said a central bank issuing a
[1:22:37.560 --> 1:22:40.920]  public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a

[1:24:10.080 --> 1:24:16.040]  the next always informative to have him on Dr. Roberts I want to get back into
[1:24:16.040 --> 1:24:19.800]  the dollar and gold and where you see all this going because you said on the
[1:24:19.800 --> 1:24:25.480]  show three years ago that within you know five years of this continued we
[1:24:25.480 --> 1:24:29.320]  could lose the dollar and you said a year ago and two years it could happen
[1:24:29.320 --> 1:24:33.000]  so I want to get your revised breakdown on that and then how this could
[1:24:33.000 --> 1:24:37.280]  unravel what what this means the average person's saying well the average
[1:24:37.280 --> 1:24:42.120]  Joe's will how does that hurt me having a weak dollar but separately Obama you
[1:24:42.120 --> 1:24:46.840]  mean you were such a critic of Bush because of his just outrageous attacks
[1:24:46.840 --> 1:24:49.680]  on the Bill of Rights and Constitution and tripling size of government the
[1:24:49.680 --> 1:24:54.440]  rest of it that at first you thought well we've got to repudiate Bush by
[1:24:54.440 --> 1:24:58.920]  supporting Obama but then quickly you said my gosh this guy looks like he may
[1:24:58.920 --> 1:25:01.680]  be worse I don't want to put words in your mouth but I read your columns
[1:25:01.680 --> 1:25:08.520]  every week give us your take on Barack Obama and where this guy's going well
[1:25:08.520 --> 1:25:17.720]  you know Alex nothing has changed he hasn't repealed the police state measures
[1:25:18.480 --> 1:25:24.200]  he hasn't you know he's escalated the war in Afghanistan he started anew in
[1:25:24.200 --> 1:25:31.800]  Pakistan the one good thing possibly is he's going to put some of those one
[1:25:31.800 --> 1:25:41.040]  Panama prisoners on trial in the United States and this gives a chance for the
[1:25:41.040 --> 1:25:46.840]  lawyers for those prisoners to bring the real evidence out which which if they
[1:25:46.840 --> 1:25:52.360]  succeed and are permitted by the trial judges could greatly embarrass the United
[1:25:52.360 --> 1:25:59.560]  States so you could say that this is the you could interpret it I don't know
[1:25:59.560 --> 1:26:08.480]  how to interpret it that Obama is trying to change things by putting public
[1:26:08.480 --> 1:26:17.760]  trial out and it may show that the Bush actions were really inexcusable and
[1:26:17.760 --> 1:26:23.120]  illegal so you couldn't look at that in a positive way but I can't think of
[1:26:23.120 --> 1:26:28.880]  anything anything else about the administration that you could see in a
[1:26:28.880 --> 1:26:35.800]  positive way he certainly not ended wars so he seems to be dragging his feet
[1:26:35.800 --> 1:26:42.080]  about further escalation in Afghanistan now what everyone has to understand is
[1:26:42.080 --> 1:26:48.560]  the president really hasn't got much power any more because the organized
[1:26:48.560 --> 1:26:54.880]  lobby are more powerful than the government the financial lobby
[1:26:54.880 --> 1:26:59.600]  government tax I mean they are the Treasury the Federal Reserve in other
[1:26:59.600 --> 1:27:03.280]  words they are the government you see what I'm saying it's an independent
[1:27:03.280 --> 1:27:09.760]  private lobby that controlling the two of the most important parts of the
[1:27:09.760 --> 1:27:14.440]  government the investment bankers control the Treasury and the Federal Reserve
[1:27:14.440 --> 1:27:20.480]  and then you have another very powerful lobby the military security lobby and
[1:27:20.480 --> 1:27:24.920]  they control the Pentagon and the State Department and they won't war because it
[1:27:24.920 --> 1:27:31.280]  makes money for them the security aspects like all the police state measures
[1:27:31.280 --> 1:27:36.280]  because they get more power they're less accountable and then of course we have a
[1:27:36.280 --> 1:27:45.840]  pack everyone knows the strength of the American Israeli what they call it
[1:27:45.840 --> 1:27:52.960]  American Israeli public affairs committee that that is another extremely
[1:27:52.960 --> 1:28:01.320]  powerful lobby and of course they want to keep the American troop in the Middle
[1:28:01.320 --> 1:28:11.160]  East beating down opposition to Israeli territorial expansion so if you look at
[1:28:11.160 --> 1:28:16.200]  those three lobby and in your mirror present what are you gonna do you can't
[1:28:16.200 --> 1:28:21.720]  what can you do I totally agree with you you're completely boxed in so unless
[1:28:21.720 --> 1:28:28.440]  you're extremely clever and can find some way to expose it exposing them
[1:28:28.440 --> 1:28:34.800]  without them knowing that's what you're doing I just don't think the President
[1:28:34.800 --> 1:28:41.080]  has any power well that's not gonna happen because those three lobbies and
[1:28:41.080 --> 1:28:46.160]  several others the big lawyer lobby as well they put Obama in and so he's
[1:28:46.160 --> 1:28:51.360]  gonna continue and expand the wars he's going to continue letting Goldman Sachs
[1:28:51.360 --> 1:28:56.880]  loot the nation they're in control of the system and he's one of their
[1:28:56.880 --> 1:29:01.040]  creatures and I agrees a teleprompter reading frontman just like Bush he's
[1:29:01.040 --> 1:29:06.040]  just better at it and better looking than Bush my whole issue is they they bring
[1:29:06.040 --> 1:29:09.600]  him in they build him up to mythic proportions now they're tearing him
[1:29:09.600 --> 1:29:14.560]  down that way in three years to seven years when he's gone everybody blames
[1:29:14.560 --> 1:29:18.200]  it on Obama instead of blaming it on the real power structure that's why I
[1:29:18.200 --> 1:29:22.960]  think Goldman Sachs is so arrogant and they've got North Commonplace we're gonna
[1:29:22.960 --> 1:29:26.000]  come back and talk about the police state some and more on the economy we're

[1:29:38.720 --> 1:29:41.680]  the statements they've made of the policies that they've gotten placed and
[1:29:41.680 --> 1:29:46.000]  they're saying they're gonna continue what his best dead reckoning timeline is

[1:33:24.720 --> 1:33:29.240]  former editor at the Wall Street Journal a former number two man at the
[1:33:29.240 --> 1:33:32.480]  Treasury father of ergonomics is our guest I just want to throw this out

[1:33:47.520 --> 1:33:53.320]  don't educate people if we don't expose this system then we're going to be in a
[1:33:53.320 --> 1:33:58.760]  vacuum here and and and not be able to finally remove this corrupt structure
[1:33:58.760 --> 1:34:03.240]  that's why I write the books and make the films and have the t-shirts all of it
[1:34:03.240 --> 1:34:06.600]  is about getting the message out so please visit the online video bookstore
[1:34:06.600 --> 1:34:11.400]  at info wars.com recall told free to get my new film fall the republic or the
[1:34:11.400 --> 1:34:18.440]  Obama deception 888-253-3139 going back to dr. Paul Craig Roberts doc tell
[1:34:18.440 --> 1:34:22.800]  folks about your latest book you've got a new addition out on the tyranny of good
[1:34:22.800 --> 1:34:28.800]  intentions yes the new addition out the new printing and there's another book
[1:34:28.800 --> 1:34:35.000]  coming out I think within a month oh great how the economy was lost
[1:34:35.000 --> 1:34:44.040]  explains the whole loss of the American economy and a counterpunch is sponsoring
[1:34:44.040 --> 1:34:48.200]  this and it'll be out I think within a month I think it's already advertised on
[1:34:48.200 --> 1:34:57.160]  Amazon sir how important is it that we bear testament bear witness to who's
[1:34:57.160 --> 1:35:00.640]  really done this because the establishment obviously controls the
[1:35:00.640 --> 1:35:05.000]  mainstream media owns it lock stock and barrel right house admits they're
[1:35:05.000 --> 1:35:09.680]  engaging in billions of dollars of fake news purchasing propaganda being implanted
[1:35:09.680 --> 1:35:15.280]  in in mainline TV fiction shows not just news how important is it that every
[1:35:15.280 --> 1:35:20.920]  American speak out it's very important because it's enough people to catch on
[1:35:20.920 --> 1:35:28.360]  possibly something could be done but it's so hard to wake people up and they
[1:35:28.360 --> 1:35:32.520]  get from any conflicting explanations they have their own biases and
[1:35:32.520 --> 1:35:39.280]  prejudices and that's why it makes it easy for the bad guys to prevail so I
[1:35:39.280 --> 1:35:47.760]  think that the sort of thing you try to do is very important people need to catch
[1:35:47.760 --> 1:35:54.920]  on time I mean it they may not be able to do anything now but if they don't know
[1:35:54.920 --> 1:36:01.280]  what's going on they certainly can't do anything so knowing what's happening is
[1:36:01.280 --> 1:36:06.920]  all is the beginning you don't get that far then you don't have any chance at
[1:36:06.920 --> 1:36:12.080]  all I want to finish up with the economy and again where you see it going
[1:36:12.080 --> 1:36:16.880]  with the current management clearly not changing since Bush left the same same
[1:36:16.880 --> 1:36:21.960]  people under Clinton that got rid of the yeah last eagle but but before we do
[1:36:21.960 --> 1:36:25.760]  that you talk to a lot of other economists and other authors and other
[1:36:25.760 --> 1:36:30.560]  researchers and a lot of other high-powered mainstream people are they
[1:36:30.560 --> 1:36:34.880]  horrified by the fact that things are only intensifying under Obama are they
[1:36:34.880 --> 1:36:39.000]  upset about the dollar sliding towards its death I mean when you talk to those
[1:36:39.000 --> 1:36:59.320]  others of them are in denial that they're in denial and they don't understand the situation look Alex for all of this fiscal year that's just ended the budget deficit was four times larger than 2008 so that's a massive fiscal
[1:36:59.320 --> 1:37:06.120]  stimulus in terms of conventional economic policy in addition we've had incredibly low
[1:37:06.120 --> 1:37:13.920]  interest rates the Federal Reserve has created massive bank reserves and yet it's
[1:37:13.920 --> 1:37:21.120]  had no effect on lifting the economy none the unemployment rate rises and as
[1:37:21.120 --> 1:37:27.200]  you've already made the point it it's measured if you measure the way it was
[1:37:27.200 --> 1:37:33.200]  measured when I was in the Treasury it's over 20% and so this massive
[1:37:33.200 --> 1:37:39.320]  conventional stimulus both a monetary policy and physical policy both of us
[1:37:39.320 --> 1:37:43.440]  the strongest problem we've ever had in our history they've had no effect
[1:37:43.440 --> 1:37:49.320]  whatsoever in lifting the economy houses are still going into foreclosure
[1:37:49.320 --> 1:37:54.680]  people are defaulting the real estate the commercial real estate thing is
[1:37:54.680 --> 1:37:59.960]  beginning to hit the dollar keeps thinking against every current you know
[1:37:59.960 --> 1:38:05.720]  we even talked about this it thinks against the Brazilian currency against
[1:38:05.720 --> 1:38:15.080]  the Botswana currency wherever you look is this fine of decline policy that the
[1:38:15.080 --> 1:38:20.280]  conventional policy they use physical stimulus monetary expansion it has no
[1:38:20.280 --> 1:38:25.920]  effect and yet they're all in denial they all think oh well it'll all be
[1:38:25.920 --> 1:38:31.560]  different soon that they even say we have a recovery look in any recession you
[1:38:31.560 --> 1:38:37.320]  always have an up quarter because when the recession first hits everybody stop
[1:38:37.320 --> 1:38:40.400]  producing because they don't know how bad it's going to be so inventory is get
[1:38:40.400 --> 1:38:45.720]  depleted so then you have to produce something for the inventory and you get
[1:38:45.720 --> 1:38:50.800]  an uplift and that's all we've had at this going to be another leg down see
[1:38:50.800 --> 1:38:56.640]  that's when they'll get worried when when it when the double debt arrived then
[1:38:56.640 --> 1:39:03.400]  all the mainstream conventional people in denial will start wondering hey what's
[1:39:03.400 --> 1:39:10.400]  going on and and until that happens they they simply don't have a clue they the
[1:39:10.400 --> 1:39:15.880]  Paul Krugman hasn't got a clue vernac he hasn't got a clue they don't they just
[1:39:15.880 --> 1:39:22.120]  don't what's happening is so different from what they've experienced in the past
[1:39:22.120 --> 1:39:27.400]  and you called all of this years ago so and understand you like to be you know
[1:39:27.400 --> 1:39:31.720]  precise about things but in your gut when I mean when you're sitting around
[1:39:31.720 --> 1:39:37.160]  having dinner with your wife or family and thinking about your own future
[1:39:37.160 --> 1:39:40.800]  thinking about your children and grandchildren's future what does Dr. Paul
[1:39:40.800 --> 1:39:46.040]  Craig Roberts think that this country in this world is going to look like 12
[1:39:46.040 --> 1:39:55.480]  months from now I don't know whether it'll be 12 months of 24 or 30 but when
[1:39:55.480 --> 1:40:01.040]  the dollar goes we're not going to be able to pay for our imports if you can't
[1:40:01.040 --> 1:40:09.520]  pay for your imports see we're two-thirds dependent on energy import so you
[1:40:09.520 --> 1:40:16.640]  have a lot of transportation disruption and disruptions of food delivery to
[1:40:16.640 --> 1:40:21.960]  grocery stores and and you don't know when there's any gasoline and when
[1:40:21.960 --> 1:40:28.400]  they're in and probably they'll have to kind of reserve the gasoline for the
[1:40:28.400 --> 1:40:35.120]  police force so and when you go to Walmart all the so-called cheap goods
[1:40:35.120 --> 1:40:42.040]  will be very expensive so when it finally happens it's going to be very bad
[1:40:42.040 --> 1:40:48.880]  now it's entirely possible the rest of the world will prop this up longer they
[1:40:48.880 --> 1:40:54.600]  may say oh we can't let this happen the Americans have nuclear weapons they're
[1:40:54.600 --> 1:41:00.800]  unstable we've got to prop it up and so they may prop it it may go on for five
[1:41:00.800 --> 1:41:06.880]  or six years but it's something that they can't prop up forever even foreign
[1:41:06.880 --> 1:41:12.080]  countries you know the Chinese may say let's keep buying their debt let's keep
[1:41:12.080 --> 1:41:21.800]  it going until we can figure out what to do so it could it could last even after
[1:41:21.800 --> 1:41:28.240]  it collapses just because the rest of the world is too uncertain about what
[1:41:28.240 --> 1:41:35.000]  happened well if we have to pay the consequences of our moronic policy well
[1:41:35.000 --> 1:41:38.760]  doctor you are the economist and again listed as one of the top economists in
[1:41:38.760 --> 1:41:43.880]  the world but just as a layman it looks to me on Main Street like to collapse
[1:41:43.880 --> 1:41:48.840]  really happened last year and they've just covered it up with the stimulus to a
[1:41:48.840 --> 1:41:53.480]  certain extent but with unemployment over 20% in the real indexes with every
[1:41:53.480 --> 1:41:58.440]  economist we have on I mean if this isn't the collapse I'm gonna hate to see
[1:41:58.440 --> 1:42:01.840]  this collapse you're saying could come in a year two years three years four years
[1:42:01.840 --> 1:42:06.360]  I mean not the collapse when the collapse comes it's gonna be much worse than
[1:42:06.360 --> 1:42:11.960]  so you're talking about I mean you that sounds road warrior-ish you know food
[1:42:11.960 --> 1:42:17.480]  shortages water shortages a gas shortages fuel shortages and then that's my
[1:42:17.480 --> 1:42:23.720]  final point in question I drove to our East Texas family farm to do some
[1:42:23.720 --> 1:42:28.680]  deer hunting with my with my children this weekend and I literally no
[1:42:28.680 --> 1:42:33.800]  exaggeration driving two and a half three hours probably saw 45 police cars
[1:42:33.800 --> 1:42:40.120]  I would drive there 10 years ago 15 years ago 20 years ago in college or
[1:42:40.120 --> 1:42:44.880]  high school I might have seen three I mean it was so many police cars pulling
[1:42:44.880 --> 1:42:50.040]  people over so much and half the billboards on the roads I drove on half
[1:42:50.040 --> 1:42:54.440]  of them were government tattle on your neighbor tattle for child abuse tattle
[1:42:54.440 --> 1:43:01.320]  for guns so the I mean I mean I mean I'm already living in a once free great
[1:43:01.320 --> 1:43:05.680]  nation the last vestiges are being removed and it's being replaced with
[1:43:05.680 --> 1:43:12.200]  science fiction tyranny that's right well Alex at my gun club when I go to the
[1:43:12.200 --> 1:43:18.680]  gun club the police are there in force every day they get to use it they they
[1:43:18.680 --> 1:43:29.320]  got automatic weapons it sounds like a war going on there'll be 25 35 40 police
[1:43:29.320 --> 1:43:35.600]  officers there fearing out led faster it's unbelievable and I asked I said
[1:43:35.600 --> 1:43:39.480]  what are you doing you practicing for some kind of competition and they said
[1:43:39.480 --> 1:43:44.880]  no we're practicing we I want to be sure my guys can win the shootout and I
[1:43:44.880 --> 1:43:51.560]  said shootout and this was a very rich county it's no no crime nothing I said
[1:43:51.560 --> 1:43:59.520]  shootout with who and they just looked at yeah it's in the shootouts with you I
[1:43:59.520 --> 1:44:04.200]  think that I think that's what they're practicing for you know I have the
[1:44:04.200 --> 1:44:08.240]  documents sir as you know I mean they are gearing up for all out war and don't
[1:44:08.240 --> 1:44:12.200]  they know they're working for a bunch of Bernard Madoff's that this doesn't
[1:44:12.200 --> 1:44:20.200]  have no they just they're getting unaccountable power and you know the
[1:44:20.200 --> 1:44:28.560]  police have always had a large contingent of bullies and they're just
[1:44:28.560 --> 1:44:33.040]  getting unaccountable power and they're going to enjoy using it well that was my
[1:44:33.040 --> 1:44:37.840]  final question as it implodes as we go into this long dark night slow
[1:44:37.840 --> 1:44:41.440]  incremental depression and as you're saying the the establishment's on the
[1:44:41.440 --> 1:44:45.600]  same course so it's a foregone conclusion don't the police know that as
[1:44:45.600 --> 1:44:50.120]  they're CPSing everybody's kids and tasering and SWAT teaming and taxing
[1:44:50.120 --> 1:44:53.320]  and arresting people when they're not going to have insurance or even money
[1:44:53.320 --> 1:44:57.160]  you know to pay the tickets and the jails are full don't the cops know
[1:44:57.160 --> 1:45:00.960]  that desperate people do desperate things and that it's a it's almost a
[1:45:00.960 --> 1:45:05.760]  self-fulfilling prophecy they're going to get their war and it's not going to be
[1:45:05.760 --> 1:45:10.160]  three crackheads they're fighting they're going to have to learn that no I
[1:45:10.160 --> 1:45:17.080]  don't think they realize that I you know but you know what the future may
[1:45:17.080 --> 1:45:24.600]  look like is a high unemployment and high inflation so it would be very
[1:45:24.600 --> 1:45:30.840]  threatening to the general population they'd be out of jobs and but prices would
[1:45:30.840 --> 1:45:39.000]  be right and this is a this is a situation that they can't survive in you
[1:45:39.000 --> 1:45:43.000]  can't you know it's not like the depression but you out of work but
[1:45:43.000 --> 1:45:50.480]  prices falling is that called hyper stag inflation and is that hyper stag
[1:45:50.480 --> 1:45:57.720]  inflation it's hyper inflationary depression that's the real danger I'm
[1:45:57.720 --> 1:46:02.840]  not absolutely certain it'll happen but I'm certain that that is the real
[1:46:02.840 --> 1:46:07.800]  danger and you're not thinking about it and not saying how can we be sure that
[1:46:07.800 --> 1:46:13.280]  doesn't happen it's not even on the radar screen well the people I know in the
[1:46:13.280 --> 1:46:17.560]  country who have been lower middle class are now on the verge of all going
[1:46:17.560 --> 1:46:23.080]  bankrupt everybody I know in the country around Austin and East Texas and I'm in
[1:46:23.080 --> 1:46:28.000]  touch with a lot of you know rural people and they say yeah we go to small
[1:46:28.000 --> 1:46:31.520]  towns one mile over the speed limit they pull us over give us tickets want to
[1:46:31.520 --> 1:46:36.080]  search us I mean I mean I was out in the middle of nowhere our ranch is in the
[1:46:36.080 --> 1:46:41.080]  middle of nowhere and I saw police every time I drove to the store 18 miles
[1:46:41.080 --> 1:46:46.160]  away I mean it's just total infestation and I guess cancer doesn't know it's
[1:46:46.160 --> 1:46:53.000]  cancer does it doc my god so how do you see it all ending just in
[1:46:53.000 --> 1:46:57.280]  complete civil war maybe just like Mexico a bunch of poor people under
[1:46:57.280 --> 1:47:04.440]  jackboots I can't probably like Mexico but you know the joker as we have all
[1:47:04.440 --> 1:47:10.280]  these nuclear weapons so we don't know whether the rest of the world will say
[1:47:10.280 --> 1:47:18.800]  hey let's keep them going until we can figure out what to do about them or get
[1:47:18.800 --> 1:47:25.840]  them under control but Russia had nukes and then people let it in I implode yeah
[1:47:25.840 --> 1:47:31.520]  because that was the way we were taking it over and of course Putin stopped that
[1:47:31.520 --> 1:47:41.360]  but you know we I think that we are far more dangerous than the Russians because
[1:47:41.360 --> 1:47:45.960]  they weren't they were imploding in part because they gave up their belief in
[1:47:45.960 --> 1:47:51.640]  communism and they they lost that kind of dangerous aggressive but of course we
[1:47:51.640 --> 1:47:57.200]  just play it every minute of every day in Afghanistan and Pakistan and Iraq and
[1:47:57.200 --> 1:48:01.860]  wherever else so the world knows this is a psycho decadent mad dog killing
[1:48:01.860 --> 1:48:05.760]  machine right I think you I think that sums it up I think that's the way we're
[1:48:05.760 --> 1:48:09.800]  perceived and I think the message with 9-11 is the establishment knows that
[1:48:09.800 --> 1:48:14.480]  anybody with a brain can tell that's an inside job so it's a double-edged for the
[1:48:14.480 --> 1:48:17.480]  general public it's used to scare them to go along with the police state but for
[1:48:17.480 --> 1:48:21.560]  the rest of the world it's like yeah yeah we'll we'll blow these buildings up
[1:48:21.560 --> 1:48:24.920]  to launch wars against you that's why Gary Hart wrote that letter doc mid
[1:48:24.920 --> 1:48:28.920]  energy and said look we staged terror attacks look at the Gulf of Tonkin look
[1:48:28.920 --> 1:48:40.680]  at the main you better sit down and shut up I mean yeah it's crazy it does make
[1:48:40.680 --> 1:48:45.280]  you laugh is it so much well but you know I'm not laughing at you I'm just no no
[1:48:45.280 --> 1:48:50.040]  I understand I know I mean it's just laughing at the craziness and the real
[1:48:50.040 --> 1:48:54.640]  craziness is that you know there's so many Americans that think themselves it's
[1:48:54.640 --> 1:48:58.520]  all to the earth and good people and they they hurt us right now they would
[1:48:58.520 --> 1:49:03.120]  really think we were completely insane and the entire American and we should be
[1:49:03.120 --> 1:49:09.040]  arrested and shot and I guess you hear from those people from time to time but
[1:49:09.040 --> 1:49:14.120]  they think themselves it's just really decent people and they're completely
[1:49:14.120 --> 1:49:21.760]  brainwashed they have no clue they have no idea of what's happening amazing well

[1:49:48.920 --> 1:49:57.360]  to George Humphrey in studio it's just mind-blowing to watch this happening to
[1:49:57.360 --> 1:50:03.560]  see the IMF to see the World Bank to see the Federal Reserve saying they want a
[1:50:03.560 --> 1:50:08.520]  weak dollar to know they're killing the dollar our own criminal government is
[1:50:08.520 --> 1:50:11.840]  killing our own dollar all we have left on the global of the UN states they
[1:50:11.840 --> 1:50:16.720]  wanted to industrializes they state they want to bankrupt us even rush Limbaugh's

[1:50:19.840 --> 1:50:26.320]  make us all dependent Roberts is just a good guy and he can't believe that that
[1:50:26.320 --> 1:50:30.560]  they're doing all this by design well look they're making money at record
[1:50:30.560 --> 1:50:34.920]  levels they're getting all this power they're militarizing the police they're
[1:50:34.920 --> 1:50:40.640]  putting troops on the streets by design and this is all by design but either
[1:50:40.640 --> 1:50:46.480]  way you slice it any way you cut it any way you look at it any angle this is
[1:50:46.480 --> 1:50:55.560]  movie grande bad this is classical tyranny in a big big way stay with us

[1:54:43.840 --> 1:54:47.760]  corrupt it's what variant of that corruption are we dealing with per
[1:54:47.760 --> 1:54:52.240]  country and as soon as we realize smaller government more transparency more
[1:54:52.240 --> 1:54:57.040]  accountability more aggressive populations letting governments know
[1:54:57.040 --> 1:55:01.360]  they're the boss that is the natural antibiotic against the disease of
[1:55:01.360 --> 1:55:06.120]  government it's very simple and being self-sufficient and making the right
[1:55:06.120 --> 1:55:09.320]  decisions and protecting you and your family and not being dependent on
[1:55:09.320 --> 1:55:14.360]  government that's where it starts and a lot of my listeners six years ago five
[1:55:14.360 --> 1:55:18.080]  years ago four years ago bought gold when it was $300 an ounce in 400 and
[1:55:18.080 --> 1:55:23.760]  $500 and 600 it's now 1,150 today to give us a quick report on that as the
[1:55:23.760 --> 1:55:28.000]  owner of the Genesis Network the parent company Midas Resources one of the
[1:55:28.000 --> 1:55:31.400]  biggest supporters Iran Paul out there and yes they have the best deals on
[1:55:31.400 --> 1:55:36.360]  gold and silver I have ever seen Ted yesterday was still offering gold he
[1:55:36.360 --> 1:55:42.640]  bought in the market at $1,000 an ounce when it was a thousand 140 then he ran
[1:55:42.640 --> 1:55:46.160]  out of that last night it was up to a thousand fifty in the market when he
[1:55:46.160 --> 1:55:50.200]  bought and he's passing those savings on you cannot find deals like this
[1:55:50.200 --> 1:55:54.120]  anywhere but Ted there they're openly announcing that they're gonna kill the
[1:55:54.120 --> 1:55:58.800]  dollar Paul Craig Roberts who is listed as one of the top seven economists in
[1:55:58.800 --> 1:56:03.640]  the world by Forbes says it's gonna be road warrior hell I hope he's wrong
[1:56:03.640 --> 1:56:09.120]  unfortunately I've never seen him be wrong people need to get gold and silver
[1:56:09.120 --> 1:56:12.840]  I mean that's that's what I believe in that's what I've done and if people would
[1:56:12.840 --> 1:56:15.840]  have listened to us they would have really made giant profits and protected
[1:56:15.840 --> 1:56:22.080]  themselves but Ted it just gets crazier and crazier well I have to say you can
[1:56:22.080 --> 1:56:25.920]  trust gold and silver a heck of a lot more they can trust this fiat currency
[1:56:25.920 --> 1:56:32.120]  Alex the dollar dropped below 75 today into the 74 level I've never seen this
[1:56:32.120 --> 1:56:36.960]  before or I should say it's at least incredibly rare when it happens but it
[1:56:36.960 --> 1:56:41.360]  happened 15 months ago we were going into the near depression yeah all of the
[1:56:41.360 --> 1:56:44.640]  markets right now all the paper markets and that's the only other time it's
[1:56:44.640 --> 1:56:48.280]  only happened one other time everything's down right now Alex everything
[1:56:48.280 --> 1:56:52.880]  except gold and silver everything that you can count on I mean Dow Jones Nasdaq
[1:56:52.880 --> 1:56:58.840]  TX gold Russell G. O. X. N. Y. S. C. TX the U. S. dollar the H. U. I. the
[1:56:58.840 --> 1:57:03.520]  Nikai the J. S. C. even crude oil everything is down everything's in the
[1:57:03.520 --> 1:57:08.560]  red except for gold and silver's up I mean it's just you know it's amazing to me
[1:57:08.560 --> 1:57:12.880]  what's going on and the depleted supply of physical gold I mean you can't have
[1:57:12.880 --> 1:57:17.400]  any key I mean you'd be lucky to find a coin or two at the jewelry stores in the
[1:57:17.400 --> 1:57:21.080]  corner coin shops and you know that the pawn shops are you know that it's gone
[1:57:21.080 --> 1:57:27.240]  and it's just you know and it's like this perfect storm that's developing in
[1:57:27.240 --> 1:57:31.000]  the economy and unfortunately there's gonna be a lot of people that are hurting
[1:57:31.000 --> 1:57:36.920]  I heard you interviewing Craig Roberts and it it just you know you know that guy
[1:57:36.920 --> 1:57:40.720]  coming from the Treasury knows what's going on and he said it we have a
[1:57:40.720 --> 1:57:45.000]  criminal dictatorship by Goldman Sachs tab we're about to go to break quickly
[1:57:45.000 --> 1:57:49.680]  give people today's gold price explain to them the gold you're selling them you
[1:57:49.680 --> 1:57:54.080]  bought it for what in the market so they understand it's it the stuff that I
[1:57:54.080 --> 1:57:57.520]  have that I'm gonna offer right now is the stuff that's at the thousand fifty
[1:57:57.520 --> 1:58:02.040]  level and and even going back a little bit less than that I still have that
[1:58:02.040 --> 1:58:06.960]  those walking liberties at 869 my regular plot price is over nine bucks on

[2:00:12.080 --> 2:00:20.480]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin Texas Alex
[2:00:20.480 --> 2:00:27.680]  Jones CNN has the headline majority of Americans reject swine flu vaccine
[2:00:27.680 --> 2:00:36.920]  believing it's dangerous Fox News headline has a similar statement also
[2:00:36.920 --> 2:00:42.760]  update doctors say most Britons reject swine flu vaccine that's a Reuters
[2:00:42.760 --> 2:00:50.520]  headline and I was driving down the road listening to Fox News National on
[2:00:50.520 --> 2:00:56.520]  Kale B. J. yesterday and I couldn't believe what I heard they didn't just
[2:00:56.520 --> 2:01:00.240]  say we want you to take three flu shots a year now they said every year you've
[2:01:00.240 --> 2:01:04.520]  got to take the swine flu shot from now on so see I mean it's just gonna be
[2:01:04.520 --> 2:01:07.840]  hundreds of shots they try to push on us that's coming up as well I'm gonna
[2:01:07.840 --> 2:01:11.040]  cover it all with George Humphrey he's an economist the economy first then
[2:01:11.040 --> 2:01:14.360]  swine flu the police state I'm gonna go through a bunch of news I've got and get
[2:01:14.360 --> 2:01:21.880]  his take on it but going back to Ted Anderson here briefly Ted I feel so
[2:01:21.880 --> 2:01:26.640]  good when my head hits the pillow at night that we support our operation
[2:01:26.640 --> 2:01:31.200]  fund getting the truth out by selling high-quality water filters that I use
[2:01:31.200 --> 2:01:36.040]  by selling high-quality storeable foods that I use by we also promote firearms
[2:01:36.040 --> 2:01:38.640]  we don't sell any but I do want to get some firearms sponsors we have some
[2:01:38.640 --> 2:01:43.920]  firearms training sponsors we we fund the operation you know from the tiny
[2:01:43.920 --> 2:01:49.480]  markup in competitive gold sales you have I just feel so good and all the
[2:01:49.480 --> 2:01:53.160]  emails and letters I've been getting the last few years going thank you I bought
[2:01:53.160 --> 2:01:58.600]  gold when it was 600 and I've made you know almost double my money back and
[2:01:58.600 --> 2:02:03.280]  other people going I've quadrupled my money I bought it at 270 I mean I feel
[2:02:03.280 --> 2:02:09.480]  so good not being a con artist like the mainstream media telling people to buy a
[2:02:09.480 --> 2:02:13.840]  you know General Motors stock like they were saying to do three years ago I
[2:02:13.840 --> 2:02:18.520]  mean don't you feel good being right and being a trailblazer and being on the
[2:02:18.520 --> 2:02:23.120]  cutting-edge Ted before it was cool yeah it is it's nice to be on the right
[2:02:23.120 --> 2:02:27.120]  side of the market you know when you can see a collision coming and when the
[2:02:27.120 --> 2:02:32.040]  market's not actually acting like that everybody thinks you're a fool but then
[2:02:32.040 --> 2:02:36.600]  when time goes on and you get to be proven right look who's really a fool I
[2:02:36.600 --> 2:02:43.400]  mean the people who think that they can trust this government and and its minions
[2:02:43.400 --> 2:02:49.240]  that control it the central banking institutions across this world I mean
[2:02:49.240 --> 2:02:54.000]  where do you think you know where you're coming from obviously that's it's a bad
[2:02:54.000 --> 2:02:59.240]  deal if we as citizens of the United States of America have to borrow money
[2:02:59.240 --> 2:03:03.600]  just to have it for commerce that means that if we're more successful and we
[2:03:03.600 --> 2:03:08.040]  work harder we're gonna go further into debt how can that's how the Federal
[2:03:08.040 --> 2:03:12.560]  Reserve the Federal Reserve set it up to make us dependent and it's designed
[2:03:12.560 --> 2:03:16.680]  mathematically all the top economists we've had on have documented it's I'm
[2:03:16.680 --> 2:03:20.720]  gonna have George talk about when we come back it's designed mathematically to
[2:03:20.720 --> 2:03:25.720]  impoverish you it is designed to transfer wealth there is more debt than
[2:03:25.720 --> 2:03:30.600]  there are real assets and it's all done out of fraud I'm sorry folks you got to
[2:03:30.600 --> 2:03:35.120]  protect yourself with gold and silver Ted people didn't listen a month ago when
[2:03:35.120 --> 2:03:39.240]  you had $900 gold when the market was at a thousand and you were selling it for
[2:03:39.240 --> 2:03:43.640]  $100 you know less than what the market was they didn't listen when it was it
[2:03:43.640 --> 2:03:47.440]  went above a thousand they better listen now before you run out of gold you got
[2:03:47.440 --> 2:03:52.240]  in the market at 1,050 with it now a hundred dollars over that you know the
[2:03:52.240 --> 2:03:57.160]  best deal you ever offered was two days ago was at a thousand thirty something
[2:03:57.160 --> 2:04:01.800]  bucks you know that's the gold you bought in the market was was a hundred and
[2:04:01.800 --> 2:04:06.560]  thirty dollars under in the market what it was trading at and and now it's at
[2:04:06.560 --> 2:04:11.800]  about a hundred I mean you cannot beat this type of deal eight hundred six eight

[2:08:14.000 --> 2:08:18.120]  George Humphrey is our guest of the balance of the hour he popped by the
[2:08:18.120 --> 2:08:22.160]  office last week it's more copies of fall the republic I do documentary film
[2:08:22.160 --> 2:08:25.520]  that he's a big part of one of our economists that we have in there breaking
[2:08:25.520 --> 2:08:29.120]  the facts down we have three economists in the film and you're one of the most
[2:08:29.120 --> 2:08:33.920]  informative and I said why not just come in for most of an hour next week and
[2:08:33.920 --> 2:08:38.800]  we're very honored to have him with us he is a agreed economist very successful
[2:08:38.800 --> 2:08:44.560]  businessman former Austin City Councilman author filmmaker and he's been
[2:08:44.560 --> 2:08:47.160]  somebody fighting the new world order longer than I have been he's been fighting
[2:08:47.160 --> 2:08:51.600]  at what 18 years or so two years before I got on air 14 years ago I'd met
[2:08:51.600 --> 2:08:54.960]  George at some functions and events when I was just trying to understand what
[2:08:54.960 --> 2:08:58.920]  was happening so he's been a certainly a mentor to me helping me along and we've
[2:08:58.920 --> 2:09:04.360]  all grown together George is great to have you here as always as I said last
[2:09:04.360 --> 2:09:08.400]  week it's an honor to be here and you know what not only is it an honor it's
[2:09:08.400 --> 2:09:13.680]  fun to be here it's fun to be at the center of the storm it's fun to be
[2:09:13.680 --> 2:09:19.080]  fighting the good fight it's fun to be making new friends it's fun to be talking
[2:09:19.080 --> 2:09:24.120]  about the truth it's fun to be working for a better world and a better America
[2:09:24.120 --> 2:09:28.640]  and a better family and a better self and so thanks a lot for let me be here
[2:09:28.640 --> 2:09:32.200]  well George it's awesome having you here with us I want to cover a lot of
[2:09:32.200 --> 2:09:35.880]  subjects because you're knowledgeable in a mall and of course you've been your
[2:09:35.880 --> 2:09:38.840]  own local TV show here as well done a lot of radio so you can speak on all
[2:09:38.840 --> 2:09:43.040]  these issues first off as an economist can you explain to people how fractional
[2:09:43.040 --> 2:09:46.920]  reserve banking works in a nutshell how more debt is created than physical
[2:09:46.920 --> 2:09:51.800]  assets how this financial engineered system is the key to the globalist power
[2:09:51.800 --> 2:09:55.480]  because they control the issuance of currency and credit well we'll boil it
[2:09:55.480 --> 2:10:02.640]  down to about one minute and what you need to remember is the initials OTA OTA
[2:10:02.640 --> 2:10:13.520]  out of thin air and back in 1776 Rothschild together with when he started
[2:10:13.520 --> 2:10:17.920]  the aluminum helps start the Illuminati they realized that by creating
[2:10:17.920 --> 2:10:24.480]  fractional reserve banking is that they could convince the people of their of
[2:10:24.480 --> 2:10:30.600]  the nation to put in their gold and silver and assets and give them a a
[2:10:30.600 --> 2:10:34.600]  script or a piece of paper that said that they had it and then they would
[2:10:34.600 --> 2:10:41.600]  make loans based upon this script now as time went on the reserves that were
[2:10:41.600 --> 2:10:50.600]  backing the deposits got smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller now our
[2:10:50.600 --> 2:10:55.200]  founding fathers were very very hip to this each and every one of our founding
[2:10:55.200 --> 2:10:59.040]  fathers that's why they put in article one section seven and article one
[2:10:59.040 --> 2:11:04.720]  section nine that our banking system had to have gold and silver as a backing it
[2:11:04.720 --> 2:11:10.720]  was to be controlled by the public and and that money was supposed to have real
[2:11:10.720 --> 2:11:17.160]  value and not just be a commodity and of course this has been the central fight
[2:11:17.160 --> 2:11:23.760]  within our nation from 1776 through today and Washington and Jefferson and
[2:11:23.760 --> 2:11:29.160]  Madison and Thomas Payne all talked about it and then John Quincy Adams talked
[2:11:29.160 --> 2:11:33.000]  about it Andrew Jackson talked about it and they tried to kill it assassinated
[2:11:33.000 --> 2:11:37.440]  him five times Abraham Lincoln came in always been the main threat to our
[2:11:37.440 --> 2:11:43.040]  country number one threat because whoever follow the money when I first we got
[2:11:43.040 --> 2:11:48.360]  elected on the city council I think it was I forgot who it was but they came
[2:11:48.360 --> 2:11:53.760]  into my office he said always follow the money and this is in little bitty
[2:11:53.760 --> 2:11:59.560]  Austin politics and so when you want to find out what was going on and I woke I
[2:11:59.560 --> 2:12:04.280]  got very hip to that very quick always follow the money because that is the way
[2:12:04.280 --> 2:12:10.480]  the puppet masters control us through the money number one and so then through
[2:12:10.480 --> 2:12:17.920]  Abraham Lincoln and and McKinley and and Ford and and then up to John F. Kennedy
[2:12:17.920 --> 2:12:25.360]  and now to Dr. Ron Paul we are all talking about the the the discrepancy
[2:12:25.360 --> 2:12:30.320]  between what the Constitution says and where we're supposed to have a currency
[2:12:30.320 --> 2:12:35.000]  a banking system that's controlled by the people backed by gold and silver a
[2:12:35.000 --> 2:12:40.760]  hard currency versus what we have which is the Federal Reserve Banking Act and
[2:12:40.760 --> 2:12:45.040]  of course as all of you know by now there is it's not federal there's no
[2:12:45.040 --> 2:12:50.360]  reserves and it's George that's a big deal ten years ago you couldn't say as
[2:12:50.360 --> 2:12:56.920]  you all know now in major polls 75 to 80% know it's private wanted abolished or
[2:12:56.920 --> 2:13:01.640]  audited I mean we've had a complete flip I mean what 10 15 years ago maybe five
[2:13:01.640 --> 2:13:07.320]  percent of people knew now I mean look we've had huge success thank God I am so
[2:13:07.320 --> 2:13:11.680]  glad you brought that up because 15 years ago when I talked about this I had
[2:13:11.680 --> 2:13:18.520]  to speak it with a very hush voice and show all the numbers and show everything
[2:13:18.520 --> 2:13:23.280]  and people's eyes would get real wide you're saying there's nothing behind our
[2:13:23.280 --> 2:13:29.320]  money system the Federal Reserve is not a government agency and now almost
[2:13:29.320 --> 2:13:35.120]  everybody knows it the people at Starbucks the people at Walmart people
[2:13:35.120 --> 2:13:41.200]  are hip to this and we have to thank you we have to thank Dr. Ron Paul in the
[2:13:41.200 --> 2:13:45.880]  hundreds of thousands of patriots all around this country power the real credit
[2:13:45.880 --> 2:13:51.560]  goes not just to the you know the the the the leaders fighting this but the
[2:13:51.560 --> 2:13:56.040]  people that have been person-to-person with the books the films the events they
[2:13:56.040 --> 2:14:00.480]  have that it is the people exactly reason the establishment hasn't just killed
[2:14:00.480 --> 2:14:03.680]  us you know they 20 30 years ago they would kill people absolutely talking
[2:14:03.680 --> 2:14:07.920]  about this they would kill what was the fellow's name the kind of yeah Larry
[2:14:07.920 --> 2:14:12.080]  McDonald he got whacked in 1981 congressmen and senators kids and
[2:14:12.080 --> 2:14:16.120]  kill them if they spoke out but the point is now that the idea is out there
[2:14:16.120 --> 2:14:21.240]  and that ideas are bulletproof they're having a big problem early on they knew
[2:14:21.240 --> 2:14:24.480]  they could shut it down and they could just get the few people quiet right but
[2:14:24.480 --> 2:14:28.920]  now it's too late yeah the the cat out of the bag out of the bag yeah and so
[2:14:28.920 --> 2:14:35.520]  people are getting more aware and being aware that money is the way of control
[2:14:35.520 --> 2:14:39.840]  and that the Federal Reserve controlled by whatever you want to call these
[2:14:39.840 --> 2:14:43.520]  rascals whether you want to call them the cabal the plutocracy whether you
[2:14:43.520 --> 2:14:47.080]  want to call them the Illuminati the power elite these people are in
[2:14:47.080 --> 2:14:51.520]  separation consciousness they're in fear and they're manipulating and
[2:14:51.520 --> 2:14:55.080]  controlling they're the pirates and there's always been pirates and we got
[2:14:55.080 --> 2:14:59.640]  to get that through our heads the people who control our banking systems and
[2:14:59.640 --> 2:15:04.080]  control our government are one in the same and they are manipulating and
[2:15:04.080 --> 2:15:09.000]  milking this economy for everything that they can and they are creating and
[2:15:09.000 --> 2:15:12.760]  it's not money they're not creating don't use the word money they're creating
[2:15:12.760 --> 2:15:22.000]  debt based currencies and obligations debt our currency is debt yes and and it
[2:15:22.000 --> 2:15:28.400]  is absolutely the biggest mathematical scam you can get and it's like the
[2:15:28.400 --> 2:15:34.240]  hockey stick if they charge two or three if the the spread is two or three percent at first
[2:15:34.240 --> 2:15:39.320]  the difference between the loans and what it is owed is very small but
[2:15:39.320 --> 2:15:44.520]  incrementally and that's one thing that the Illuminati always does is that they
[2:15:44.520 --> 2:15:49.800]  have worked incrementally and that patiently as as time goes on that debt
[2:15:49.800 --> 2:15:55.040]  based upon other debt continues to go up and so now it's going up but like a
[2:15:55.040 --> 2:16:02.960]  hockey skit stick and the actual debt on the debt is getting as big as the
[2:16:02.960 --> 2:16:10.000]  equity itself and remember with fractional reserve banking this money
[2:16:10.000 --> 2:16:15.640]  can never be paid back let's say we cut back all government spending and all
[2:16:15.640 --> 2:16:23.680]  taxes went to paying off the debt it is still mathematically impossible to pay
[2:16:23.680 --> 2:16:28.360]  off the debt and of course we're not going to to stop spending we're not
[2:16:28.360 --> 2:16:33.520]  going to stop creating debt as I heard Dr. Roberts just speak and he was an
[2:16:33.520 --> 2:16:38.080]  incredible guest and I really give you a lot of credit for having him on he was
[2:16:38.080 --> 2:16:43.880]  saying as we were talking about last week this year's federal budget is debt
[2:16:43.880 --> 2:16:54.520]  is 400% greater than the year before that is absolute incredible insanity you
[2:16:54.520 --> 2:17:00.160]  can't get out of debt by digging the hole deeper you can't do it and it's
[2:17:00.160 --> 2:17:05.280]  made up debt to the private banks of course it is and and and all this money
[2:17:05.280 --> 2:17:11.960]  and is going here's the question we're approaching an end game here what do you
[2:17:11.960 --> 2:17:15.080]  think the time frame you know a few months ago filming follow Republic at
[2:17:15.080 --> 2:17:20.040]  your house we were standing around the kitchen drinking tea talking about the
[2:17:20.040 --> 2:17:23.160]  you know time frames whether it's going to be inflation or whether it's going to
[2:17:23.160 --> 2:17:27.800]  be depression what's going to happen with the currency how do you see this
[2:17:27.800 --> 2:17:32.520]  unfolding okay first of all we have to learn from history and in 1989 a very
[2:17:32.520 --> 2:17:38.800]  similar situation hit Japan and they had financing vehicles that were very
[2:17:38.800 --> 2:17:45.080]  similar to our derivatives and and they crashed and yet the ruling class of
[2:17:45.080 --> 2:17:49.600]  Japan would not flush those out of the system because they were protecting the
[2:17:49.600 --> 2:17:55.400]  ruling class now Japan is the most productive nation per capita in the
[2:17:55.400 --> 2:17:59.320]  world they have just glistening industry incredibly hard-working focused
[2:17:59.320 --> 2:18:03.720]  people so you give us the same recipe but with our big welfare state and
[2:18:03.720 --> 2:18:10.560]  laziness we're dead meat yes and Japan in the period of time since 1989 their
[2:18:10.560 --> 2:18:15.840]  amount of monies that they have spent from their federal government trying to
[2:18:15.840 --> 2:18:20.560]  fix this situation has been approximately equal to what we're doing
[2:18:20.560 --> 2:18:25.640]  right now and Japan even though they're one of the world's leading exporters
[2:18:25.640 --> 2:18:31.240]  they're incredibly technologically advanced they have had 20 years of
[2:18:31.240 --> 2:18:37.520]  recession the Nikkei was at 39,000 it's 9,000 right now the real estate boom has
[2:18:37.520 --> 2:18:41.280]  gone down and I go to Japan all the time I'm gonna be going there shortly and
[2:18:41.280 --> 2:18:46.680]  it's an amazing place these people work they're educated and they're focused on
[2:18:46.680 --> 2:18:52.080]  creating money and they've been going for 20 years and they're still in the
[2:18:52.080 --> 2:18:57.200]  whole because all the money that they're producing all their profits is going to
[2:18:57.200 --> 2:19:02.680]  pay the interest on their derivatives it's called the Japan syndrome and so we
[2:19:02.680 --> 2:19:09.600]  are in a very very similar situation but worse but worse but worse and what is
[2:19:09.600 --> 2:19:16.400]  even what I consider to be worse is the quality of the consciousness and the
[2:19:16.400 --> 2:19:23.040]  energy of the people in this country we used to be that most hard-working
[2:19:23.040 --> 2:19:29.280]  self-sufficient freedom-loving honest people in the whole country in the whole
[2:19:29.280 --> 2:19:32.480]  world we're making generalizations there's we're not saying everybody's bad
[2:19:32.480 --> 2:19:36.920]  it's just that you go out there we're a lot of demonic goblin people I mean
[2:19:36.920 --> 2:19:40.720]  they're not really evil people in in in I'm glad you said you know sometime you
[2:19:40.720 --> 2:19:45.080]  know and in talking about this stuff you know there's there are so many good

[2:24:27.280 --> 2:24:35.040]  give some new people a chance 1-800-259-9231 George you were trying to
[2:24:35.040 --> 2:24:37.960]  make a point before we went to break but I wanted to make this point it's a
[2:24:37.960 --> 2:24:43.120]  double-edged sword not only for 15 years have I been speaking out of 14
[2:24:43.120 --> 2:24:47.840]  years on air you 18 or more and many others for decades like Ron Paul 30 plus
[2:24:47.840 --> 2:24:53.400]  years it takes time to do this the globalist love to give us an instant
[2:24:53.400 --> 2:24:57.360]  gratification society where we expect everything instantly but they understand
[2:24:57.360 --> 2:25:01.640]  the power of taking their time so that's why we need to counter them with
[2:25:01.640 --> 2:25:04.840]  that knowing that we're not going to see instant results when we do something
[2:25:04.840 --> 2:25:09.080]  it takes time to go out and bounce around and grow it's like seeds it's like
[2:25:09.080 --> 2:25:15.440]  growing a crop right absolutely and the question is is that every one of us has
[2:25:15.440 --> 2:25:20.920]  a choice in front of us we all have a choice do we actually believe that
[2:25:20.920 --> 2:25:27.600]  freedom and sovereignty and the highest values of the Constitution are something
[2:25:27.600 --> 2:25:31.800]  that are positive for our nation for our community for our families and for
[2:25:31.800 --> 2:25:36.920]  ourselves and most people will go oh yeah yeah of course it is but do is this
[2:25:36.920 --> 2:25:43.000]  something that is really is freedom and sovereignty for ourselves and in the
[2:25:43.000 --> 2:25:46.720]  coming future important because you and Sharon well the head producer we're
[2:25:46.720 --> 2:25:49.680]  talking during the break he was saying all his friends know the wars are for
[2:25:49.680 --> 2:25:53.240]  money everybody knows the banks are right being us well we shouldn't just take
[2:25:53.240 --> 2:25:58.320]  this like a crack or being beaten exactly and this is part of the massive
[2:25:58.320 --> 2:26:04.020]  massive mind control and this is not just this is just not words is that the
[2:26:04.020 --> 2:26:07.960]  Illuminati or the power leader whatever you want to call these rascals have
[2:26:07.960 --> 2:26:13.480]  created the most amazing and the most subtle mind control at every different
[2:26:13.480 --> 2:26:19.600]  level physical emotional spiritual electronic at all different levels to
[2:26:19.600 --> 2:26:25.040]  interrupt our our chakra system to interrupt our endocrine system to
[2:26:25.040 --> 2:26:31.240]  interrupt the way that we as human beings are able to intellectually process
[2:26:31.240 --> 2:26:35.360]  information and that's what all the globalist that when we cover this in
[2:26:35.360 --> 2:26:40.040]  endgame they admit they're poisoning us they're poisoning our food and water to
[2:26:40.040 --> 2:26:46.360]  make us more easily controlled oh it's it's amazing I mean in 1942 through
[2:26:46.360 --> 2:26:54.440]  1945 both Ada uncle Adolf Hitler and uncle Joseph Stalin were putting fluoride
[2:26:54.440 --> 2:26:59.920]  into their concentration camps because fluoride is a thyroid inhibitor and
[2:26:59.920 --> 2:27:03.560]  that's in a Pulitzer prize winning book that's that came out in Nuremberg that
[2:27:03.560 --> 2:27:11.000]  is not a conspiracy of course this is fact and it's been fact for 50 and they
[2:27:11.000 --> 2:27:14.840]  do it here and the local media likes to laugh and feel like they're part of the
[2:27:14.840 --> 2:27:17.480]  establishment even though we've got probably a hundred thousand Austinites
[2:27:17.480 --> 2:27:20.680]  awake and we're all over the country we can't get it out of our water yeah and
[2:27:20.680 --> 2:27:25.880]  so massive amounts of fluoride in Florida was they start putting in the
[2:27:25.880 --> 2:27:30.240]  water in the late 1880s because the aluminum industry had nowhere to put
[2:27:30.240 --> 2:27:35.040]  their toxic waste and they cooked up these false studies to show that would
[2:27:35.040 --> 2:27:41.920]  protect teeth which is absolute BS and every independent study has shown that
[2:27:41.920 --> 2:27:46.440]  fluoride does not protect teeth and what's really important of all the water
[2:27:46.440 --> 2:27:51.080]  that goes through the city water less than one half of 1% of the water that
[2:27:51.080 --> 2:27:56.680]  goes through the taps is actually taken in and used for drinking water and so
[2:27:56.680 --> 2:28:01.600]  this whole concept is absolutely silly so let's say that fluoride really did
[2:28:01.600 --> 2:28:05.880]  help tooth decay which it does not there's better ways topical ways of
[2:28:05.880 --> 2:28:09.800]  giving it gives you fluorosis it causes bone cancer it's let's just say it's
[2:28:09.800 --> 2:28:13.320]  good why don't they say to it topically no we're gonna put it in the water because
[2:28:13.320 --> 2:28:17.680]  now they're using it as a pesticide on crops and and for years it kills bugs
[2:28:17.680 --> 2:28:20.920]  but we're gonna eat drink it and for years and years and years back in the
[2:28:20.920 --> 2:28:25.520]  30s 40s and 50s the number one ingredient the number one ingredient in
[2:28:25.520 --> 2:28:30.280]  rat poison was fluoride and so you could still buy it where it says fluoride in
[2:28:30.280 --> 2:28:36.360]  the back it's the con rat poison and so not only are we interrupting our
[2:28:36.360 --> 2:28:40.400]  thyroid because of the thought all all the endocrine system and if you look
[2:28:40.400 --> 2:28:45.800]  here are the concepts of chakras the way human beings connect within their own
[2:28:45.800 --> 2:28:50.880]  conscious development the electrical system in the body exactly exactly and
[2:28:50.880 --> 2:28:57.760]  not in our pituitary is being messed up with aspartame the chemtrails are
[2:28:57.760 --> 2:29:02.000]  coming in and MSG MS mercury and what about the
[2:29:02.000 --> 2:29:05.600]  media saying there's no mercury in the flu shot when it's on the insert it's
[2:29:05.600 --> 2:29:10.480]  to Marisol which is even more toxic than mercury is I mean you know they they
[2:29:10.480 --> 2:29:15.760]  change the name it's a hyper form of mercury it's a hyper form of mercury and

[2:36:11.960 --> 2:36:15.280]  militarization of police they're everywhere they're giving people tickets
[2:36:15.280 --> 2:36:20.320]  for no reason they're taking people's kids without due process the CPS the
[2:36:20.320 --> 2:36:24.920]  taxes the bureaucracy the state taxes the international taxes California and
[2:36:24.920 --> 2:36:28.720]  Oregon passing carbon taxes the carbon tax I have an article here from
[2:36:28.720 --> 2:36:32.760]  prisonplanet.com that has links to mainstream news the Washington Post US
[2:36:32.760 --> 2:36:36.920]  military employees counter insurgency strategy in California city former
[2:36:36.920 --> 2:36:41.400]  special forces colonel says violence hit town is a laboratory as Washington
[2:36:41.400 --> 2:36:44.880]  Post advocates nationwide implementation of troops on the streets in
[2:36:44.880 --> 2:36:52.400]  America this is really happening I mean this is real bona fide tyranny your take
[2:36:52.400 --> 2:36:58.760]  on that well as they say power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts
[2:36:58.760 --> 2:37:05.640]  absolutely and this is just a fact of life and as the power elite those who
[2:37:05.640 --> 2:37:09.800]  are in separation consciousness those are in fear consciousness realize that
[2:37:09.800 --> 2:37:13.680]  the internet and the consciousness of the people is increasing more and more
[2:37:13.680 --> 2:37:19.000]  and the people like Alex Jones and myself and Paul Craig Roberts and the
[2:37:19.000 --> 2:37:23.080]  hundreds of thousands of other patriots around the country who are working for a
[2:37:23.080 --> 2:37:28.280]  better freer sovereign nation and world right now are getting the message out and
[2:37:28.280 --> 2:37:33.320]  getting the message out very effectively these people are freaking out and they
[2:37:33.320 --> 2:37:37.400]  are the first thing that they think of is getting a bigger stick trying to knock
[2:37:37.400 --> 2:37:42.840]  us down trying to hit us trying to control us and of course the police
[2:37:42.840 --> 2:37:48.440]  departments are the main place now most the cops don't know what's going on now
[2:37:48.440 --> 2:37:55.240]  when I was a city council member we still had a peace officers we had peace
[2:37:55.240 --> 2:38:00.720]  officers and we had policemen that were there for the people of Austin and as a
[2:38:00.720 --> 2:38:06.160]  matter of fact it wasn't that long ago that police officers and peace officers
[2:38:06.160 --> 2:38:12.880]  wore blue and the sheriffs wore brown and now they're all in black I see that
[2:38:12.880 --> 2:38:17.080]  Maryland is just not Maryland but Massachusetts which is supposed to be the
[2:38:17.080 --> 2:38:21.640]  home of the most liberal people in the country now have got all their police
[2:38:21.640 --> 2:38:26.080]  officers in all black and they were in the news a police chief said this is to
[2:38:26.080 --> 2:38:30.520]  intimidate us and it's like a praetorian guard and again history tends to repeat
[2:38:30.520 --> 2:38:35.280]  itself and just like the Caesar when it went from a republic to an empire they
[2:38:35.280 --> 2:38:38.640]  created the praetorian guard and the praetorian guard of course all wore all
[2:38:38.640 --> 2:38:45.600]  black and that is a psychological way to create fear and all of this is a choice
[2:38:45.600 --> 2:38:52.760]  between fear and love between separation and coming together and this you know as
[2:38:52.760 --> 2:38:58.600]  I've said thousand times this is bigger than just an economic or a political or
[2:38:58.600 --> 2:39:03.560]  a cultural war this is a time for each and every one of us to make a choice it's
[2:39:03.560 --> 2:39:08.560]  a time of spiritual choice whether we're gonna live in unity consciousness and
[2:39:08.560 --> 2:39:14.240]  cooperation and be sovereign and free and love our first of all love ourselves
[2:39:14.240 --> 2:39:17.800]  and our family and our world and the good things that that government can
[2:39:17.800 --> 2:39:22.840]  bring such as the Constitution or whether we're gonna close our eyes and
[2:39:22.840 --> 2:39:28.760]  we're going to listen to these rascals and all of their all of their lies and
[2:39:28.760 --> 2:39:36.840]  everything that they're saying to us ABC CBS NBC Time Newsweek you know every
[2:39:36.840 --> 2:39:42.560]  place it's all propaganda to create fear so that George there's no longer any
[2:39:42.560 --> 2:39:46.240]  doubt I mean every if there was a checklist of 30 things that are tyranny
[2:39:46.240 --> 2:39:50.280]  they've double-checked everything then it's now admitted and this started
[2:39:50.280 --> 2:39:53.760]  decades ago but that almost all TV is government paid for and they're writing
[2:39:53.760 --> 2:39:59.480]  the scripts with all these messages of tyranny it's including NPR and for all
[2:39:59.480 --> 2:40:05.960]  my good liberal friends oh it's the worst listen to NPR wake up it's the
[2:40:05.960 --> 2:40:13.600]  worst just because they say it with kind of a sweet it's hypnotizing it makes
[2:40:13.600 --> 2:40:20.000]  me physically ill to listen to those hypocrites physically ill and I'll tell
[2:40:20.000 --> 2:40:25.640]  you what look at Obama expanding all the wars the deceptive your first movie on
[2:40:25.640 --> 2:40:30.640]  this the Obama deception you got to underword the word deception because this
[2:40:30.640 --> 2:40:36.400]  guy even though he's the most incredibly charismatic person who's been on the
[2:40:36.400 --> 2:40:43.800]  scene for the last 50 years it's all about deception deception deception every
[2:40:43.800 --> 2:40:49.560]  single one of his promises as you have pointed out again and again and again
[2:40:49.560 --> 2:40:56.360]  he's gone 180 degrees apart and I still see my friends who are oh Obama Obama
[2:40:56.360 --> 2:41:01.480]  and so I say well do you support the war and they and they kind of shake a
[2:41:01.480 --> 2:41:05.760]  little bit and and most of them run off because they know that there's going to
[2:41:05.760 --> 2:41:10.040]  be an intelligent discussion because they're cognitive dissonance and
[2:41:10.040 --> 2:41:14.040]  remember this term cognitive dissonance and it's something that we all have is
[2:41:14.040 --> 2:41:19.160]  that we invest our time energy or money in a concept is that when we find out
[2:41:19.160 --> 2:41:24.240]  that that concept is not right psychologically we create barriers and
[2:41:24.240 --> 2:41:28.600]  fight against that and that's what's called having an open mind in listening
[2:41:28.600 --> 2:41:36.840]  and every single point that Obama made on on the campaign trail as you have so
[2:41:36.840 --> 2:41:43.560]  eloquently pointed out and so factually pointed out he's gone 180% against it he
[2:41:43.560 --> 2:41:50.400]  is so far more of what is classically called a fascist than even George Bush
[2:41:50.400 --> 2:41:56.760]  in and and people say well you're just a Republican in four years ago there's
[2:41:56.760 --> 2:42:00.040]  they were saying you're just a Democrat you know we're neither Democrat or
[2:42:00.040 --> 2:42:06.640]  Republican we are American citizens who believe in the Constitution this is not
[2:42:06.640 --> 2:42:11.280]  a question of right or wrong you know right or left it's a question of right
[2:42:11.280 --> 2:42:17.560]  or wrong do we want freedom do we want truth do we want a better America or are
[2:42:17.560 --> 2:42:21.400]  we going to be asleep well the American people have not been taught in the last
[2:42:21.400 --> 2:42:25.680]  30 40 years what tyranny is and so they're told here's freedom but it's
[2:42:25.680 --> 2:42:30.240]  really tyranny and then they tell the public that those of us that are for
[2:42:30.240 --> 2:42:35.080]  freedom that we're the bad ones I mean I've had Salon and all six of George
[2:42:35.080 --> 2:42:39.960]  Soros's big publications and the New Republic and the ADL and CBS and the
[2:42:39.960 --> 2:42:45.160]  Jerusalem Post all in the last day come out and say no longer are they just
[2:42:45.160 --> 2:42:50.040]  ignoring me or making fun of me or just attacking me they're now saying we got to
[2:42:50.040 --> 2:42:53.200]  shut this guy up he's dangerous and the reason they're now saying this is
[2:42:53.200 --> 2:42:57.160]  they're watching our growth curve yeah and the thing that but it's going
[2:42:57.160 --> 2:43:02.520]  straight up and I say to them I am trying to be loving I I know they're
[2:43:02.520 --> 2:43:06.480]  wrong I know they're abusive I know they're hurting my country I know they're
[2:43:06.480 --> 2:43:10.720]  involved in evil and I'm telling them now I'm gonna look at them right now and
[2:43:10.720 --> 2:43:14.080]  tell them you're in the wrong you know you're bad you know you're lying you
[2:43:14.080 --> 2:43:17.800]  know you're using duplicity you know the New World Order is real I mean the ADL
[2:43:17.800 --> 2:43:22.920]  and CBS wrote articles saying I'm this big liar I say they're setting up a
[2:43:22.920 --> 2:43:27.240]  world government I mean it's all over the news earlier on the show I went over a
[2:43:27.240 --> 2:43:30.640]  bunch of mainstream I mean look at this Financial Times of London this is one of
[2:43:30.640 --> 2:43:34.360]  thousands in the last year yes and now for world government and this article
[2:43:34.360 --> 2:43:38.280]  says we've lied to you for your own good we're taking over it's authoritarian
[2:43:38.280 --> 2:43:42.520]  these are quotes here's another one in here I've got the New York Times
[2:43:42.520 --> 2:43:47.480]  Bankind Moon you coming out and calling for world government and world taxes
[2:43:47.480 --> 2:43:53.200]  habits but this one I'm saying George what is the ADL and CBS doing what what
[2:43:53.200 --> 2:43:57.560]  is salon doing when when when they come out and say it's a conspiracy theory
[2:43:57.560 --> 2:44:01.120]  there's no mercury in the shots when the insert says it what are they doing when
[2:44:01.120 --> 2:44:04.680]  they say there's no world government when it's simultaneously being announced
[2:44:04.680 --> 2:44:08.640]  by mainstream media is a good thing it's almost like they want to destroy
[2:44:08.640 --> 2:44:12.960]  themselves I mean do they understand or are they so arrogant and they think it's
[2:44:12.960 --> 2:44:16.960]  20 years ago and people just bought whatever they said well it's ad homily
[2:44:16.960 --> 2:44:22.040]  what they're trying to do is they're trying to go after you as a person and
[2:44:22.040 --> 2:44:26.880]  I've I know you and for people who listen to Alex for the first time and we've
[2:44:26.880 --> 2:44:32.840]  all gone through our Alex initiation and ransom raise any shouts and he raises
[2:44:32.840 --> 2:44:37.760]  his voice and so many people say I can't stand he's just too intense and I just
[2:44:37.760 --> 2:44:43.400]  say listen to him for a week and kind of I don't want to talk about me but listen
[2:44:43.400 --> 2:44:48.800]  what I'm saying because this is important and Alex not only is about 98% of
[2:44:48.800 --> 2:44:55.960]  what he's saying if not 100% right on accurate that you won't get on CBS or
[2:44:55.960 --> 2:45:01.520]  NBC or whatever which is information you need to know but he also has a heart
[2:45:01.520 --> 2:45:08.520]  of gold is as gruff and his grump busy son oh he's a great guy and what's more
[2:45:08.520 --> 2:45:13.440]  important is that for all the time I had my television show I would invite
[2:45:13.440 --> 2:45:19.440]  hundreds of city officials newscasters people to come in and not debate but
[2:45:19.440 --> 2:45:23.320]  just have a discussion about this and I know you've done the same thing and you
[2:45:23.320 --> 2:45:29.960]  would invite the top newscasters of CBS NBC of the ADL to come in here and just
[2:45:29.960 --> 2:45:34.640]  have a discussion and and share back and forth but they won't do it they won't
[2:45:34.640 --> 2:45:39.480]  come and have an honest they have to dehumanize you and and so instead of
[2:45:39.480 --> 2:45:46.560]  as human beings talking about our point of view and they want to separate
[2:45:46.560 --> 2:45:50.600]  everybody of course and it's all about the that's why Chris Matthews and the
[2:45:50.600 --> 2:45:55.480]  folks on CNN on Scottish MSNBC they have that talking point that if you say I
[2:45:55.480 --> 2:45:59.120]  don't want socialist health care they go why are you a racist yes obviously it's
[2:45:59.120 --> 2:46:03.840]  illogical it has nothing to do with that they are invoking racism they are the
[2:46:03.840 --> 2:46:08.240]  racist they are the people using it as a political weapon and and I'm sure that
[2:46:08.240 --> 2:46:12.680]  you would invite Chris or any of these we have we we've called them all it say
[2:46:12.680 --> 2:46:17.040]  just come on down look we're just gonna and we don't even have to debate you can
[2:46:17.040 --> 2:46:21.760]  have your say I'll have my say no fighting back and forth and let the
[2:46:21.760 --> 2:46:26.200]  people decide but you know what you've been doing this for years and years and
[2:46:26.200 --> 2:46:30.600]  years and they won't do it and because they've got something to hide they've
[2:46:30.600 --> 2:46:35.800]  got something to hide and so folks who are listening the people who are
[2:46:35.800 --> 2:46:40.760]  listening to this message right now you are the power if each and every one of
[2:46:40.760 --> 2:46:45.560]  you today can go out and talk to one person about this and plant some well
[2:46:45.560 --> 2:46:48.920]  tell them about Gandhi because you he has those quotes he went around for 20
[2:46:48.920 --> 2:46:52.440]  years just teaching people they had power and then suddenly it all imploded
[2:46:52.440 --> 2:46:57.480]  out and and and I go to India almost every year and and and I study in India
[2:46:57.480 --> 2:47:02.320]  and Mahatma Gandhi is my I've been to his home I've read him for years and
[2:47:02.320 --> 2:47:07.000]  years and years and he was a very very bright man he went to Oxford he got his
[2:47:07.000 --> 2:47:11.280]  law degree he went down South Africa he was very wealthy down there but when he
[2:47:11.280 --> 2:47:16.760]  came back to India there's about 350 million people living in India in about
[2:47:16.760 --> 2:47:23.160]  300,000 British and the British were in complete control of the Indian subcontinent
[2:47:23.160 --> 2:47:28.600]  which at that time also included the the nations of Pakistan Kashmir and
[2:47:28.600 --> 2:47:35.480]  Kashmir in the whole area and 300,000 people were the Sahibs of the whole
[2:47:35.480 --> 2:47:41.400]  nation because they had convinced the intellect not the intellect but the
[2:47:41.400 --> 2:47:46.960]  minds of the Indian people that they were beneath them and that the English were
[2:47:46.960 --> 2:47:53.000]  more powerful and in in Gandhi came back and he realized that this was a fight
[2:47:53.000 --> 2:47:59.320]  for the minds in the hearts of the Indian people and so he showed through
[2:47:59.320 --> 2:48:04.640]  example through love through his dedication and he would go to village
[2:48:04.640 --> 2:48:10.480]  to village and the most important thing he said is that the seed of God is in
[2:48:10.480 --> 2:48:16.840]  the heart of every man woman and child and that he was there to show through
[2:48:16.840 --> 2:48:22.360]  example that we could nurture the seed and that we were divine sovereign beings
[2:48:22.360 --> 2:48:28.400]  whether we were white black Asian and when he got the Indian people to
[2:48:28.400 --> 2:48:33.400]  understand that they had value that they had intellect that they had rights and
[2:48:33.400 --> 2:48:38.560]  his main thing was to get the the British out still as friends he didn't
[2:48:38.560 --> 2:48:43.680]  see them as enemies he saw them as opponents about and he realized that
[2:48:43.680 --> 2:48:49.320]  they had wrong thinking and he did this through hard work and through peace and
[2:48:49.320 --> 2:48:55.520]  you know what folks we can't beat the Illuminati right now with guns we've
[2:48:55.520 --> 2:48:59.640]  got to do it with intellect they want to make it a physical fight yes now at the
[2:48:59.640 --> 2:49:03.160]  same time we should defend ourselves of course and what Gandhi had something to
[2:49:03.160 --> 2:49:08.800]  say about that absolutely Gandhi Gandhi was no coward Gandhi was Gandhi was a man
[2:49:08.800 --> 2:49:13.000]  he let him beat him up all the time was a man's man but he would say that it's
[2:49:13.000 --> 2:49:19.520]  better for a person to go to war and fight and die for their country than to
[2:49:19.520 --> 2:49:25.960]  then to be a coward and hide under the the banner of nonviolent civil
[2:49:25.960 --> 2:49:29.280]  disobedience well it's you got to know when to hold him no one to fold him no
[2:49:29.280 --> 2:49:32.800]  one to walk away no one to run you got to know when to play your cards I mean at
[2:49:32.800 --> 2:49:36.200]  points where there's police and they're just peacefully protesting let them beat
[2:49:36.200 --> 2:49:40.200]  them up in front of people and because that then shows people but at the same
[2:49:40.200 --> 2:49:43.600]  time if they're rounding up people in villages taking them to FEMA camps you
[2:49:43.600 --> 2:49:47.720]  got to defend yourself absolutely and for example when what was going on in
[2:49:47.720 --> 2:49:51.560]  Russia was happening in the Ukraine when Stalin was going you know just
[2:49:51.560 --> 2:49:57.400]  decimating the Ukraine Gandhi was very clear that it was important for those
[2:49:57.400 --> 2:50:05.480]  people to stand up and fight he was no coward and and we encourage you not to
[2:50:05.480 --> 2:50:10.600]  be cowards to see this thing as clearly crystal clearly as possible these
[2:50:10.600 --> 2:50:16.680]  people care not one eye odor about your freedom or your life and so you need to
[2:50:16.680 --> 2:50:21.040]  protect yourself on all different fronts but but by don't be cowards get
[2:50:21.040 --> 2:50:24.360]  involved speak out like you're not gonna be able to physically fight if you can't
[2:50:24.360 --> 2:50:28.000]  even talk to your neighbor about this exactly it's an increments it's in steps
[2:50:28.000 --> 2:50:33.360]  yes and it's the through the first awareness becoming aware of the mass
[2:50:33.360 --> 2:50:37.520]  of illusion the mass of illusion of yeah don't just believe everything we're

[2:52:25.960 --> 2:52:30.880]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[2:52:30.880 --> 2:52:35.280]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world

[2:54:10.520 --> 2:54:13.680]  hour eight after I want to go to calls but George you're making a really good
[2:54:13.680 --> 2:54:18.080]  point about how you read the New York Times and it's all this well woven
[2:54:18.080 --> 2:54:23.160]  together disinformation rationals and it's just a continual narrative of
[2:54:23.160 --> 2:54:28.280]  deception it's a matrix of fraud but when you know all the facts then it's
[2:54:28.280 --> 2:54:31.800]  completely clear but the average person it's all written like it's reasonable
[2:54:31.800 --> 2:54:36.280]  but it's a fantasy land it's like people with fantasy football I mean they
[2:54:36.280 --> 2:54:39.040]  they're acting like they're really running quarterbacks and on this little
[2:54:39.040 --> 2:54:42.840]  power trip it's the same thing they're almost a little box yeah it's just
[2:54:42.840 --> 2:54:47.960]  absolutely amazing because I have been studying this stuff for a long long time
[2:54:47.960 --> 2:54:51.960]  and the other day house reading the New York Times which is the number one
[2:54:51.960 --> 2:54:56.920]  publication and I start reading articles about cap and trade or the vaccines or
[2:54:56.920 --> 2:55:03.200]  whatever it was and I just let myself read it like without my my own point of
[2:55:03.200 --> 2:55:10.240]  view and I realized how incredibly seductive and believable their point is
[2:55:10.240 --> 2:55:15.720]  because they'll mix a little truth in and have a smattering yeah and they do
[2:55:15.720 --> 2:55:22.560]  this so well and as you say this is the matrix and what we're facing is so
[2:55:22.560 --> 2:55:28.120]  similar to the movie the matrix the illusion out there is just deeper
[2:55:28.120 --> 2:55:34.720]  deeper deeper than almost any of us can understand and we have to understand
[2:55:34.720 --> 2:55:40.200]  that to get through this period of time and and and what the Mayan calendar calls
[2:55:40.200 --> 2:55:46.480]  2012 or what the what the Rishi's Nindia call the changing from the Kali Yuga to
[2:55:46.480 --> 2:55:50.120]  the Dwarpa Yuga this has all been prophesized for a while the elite
[2:55:50.120 --> 2:55:53.000]  believe there's a big change but it's not gonna be into the world they believe
[2:55:53.000 --> 2:55:56.040]  they're bringing their system in and they're actually trying to suppress
[2:55:56.040 --> 2:55:59.280]  people waking up because they know a big change is coming let's take some calls
[2:55:59.280 --> 2:56:03.840]  Matthew in Arizona you're on the air with George Humphrey go ahead
[2:56:03.840 --> 2:56:07.600]  you guys are doing great today but I have some really important to bring up
[2:56:07.600 --> 2:56:12.600]  that I never really get you know I never really here on your show it's a student
[2:56:12.600 --> 2:56:19.080]  at universities and how bad the liberal propaganda has been getting well we do
[2:56:19.080 --> 2:56:22.440]  talk about how they don't let people have free speech in a lot of universities
[2:56:22.440 --> 2:56:26.080]  they bully the students they call it liberal it's not it's it's it's it's
[2:56:26.080 --> 2:56:32.080]  really fascism and it's it's anti-family it's anti-male they want to destroy the
[2:56:32.080 --> 2:56:36.200]  existing order so that everybody is basically destitute institutionalized
[2:56:36.200 --> 2:56:41.960]  and have to lean on the state George well when I think of liberal I think of
[2:56:41.960 --> 2:56:47.560]  Thomas Jefferson I think of somebody with an open mind who is inquisitive who
[2:56:47.560 --> 2:56:52.480]  is there who wants to play by the rules who has an open heart to call these son
[2:56:52.480 --> 2:56:57.080]  of a guns liberal and and and and we all have these friends who are liberal
[2:56:57.080 --> 2:57:00.560]  Democrats will see that's the matrix they think they're Thomas Jefferson the
[2:57:00.560 --> 2:57:03.920]  average liberal when really they're working for a eugenics death cult and
[2:57:03.920 --> 2:57:10.000]  in in the amazing not the amazing in the reality is is that about 99% of the
[2:57:10.000 --> 2:57:15.440]  liberal Democrats in this country believe that they're doing the right thing
[2:57:15.440 --> 2:57:19.440]  they think they're doing the right thing they read the New York Times they
[2:57:19.440 --> 2:57:26.480]  watch CNN they they've swallowed this lie hook line and they know their liberal
[2:57:26.480 --> 2:57:29.600]  paradigm is it perfect but it's better than that Republican paradigm yeah which
[2:57:29.600 --> 2:57:33.520]  is only another wing on the same bird thank you Matthew Don and Toronto you're
[2:57:33.520 --> 2:57:39.600]  on the air go ahead Don yes hi Alex George I'm calling from Canada where the
[2:57:39.600 --> 2:57:46.240]  H1N1 massive vaccine campaign is in full throttle right now and there have been
[2:57:46.240 --> 2:57:51.480]  reports of one person dying of complications there's a bunch of reports
[2:57:51.480 --> 2:57:56.000]  of deaths all over the world China France England and they're really covering
[2:57:56.000 --> 2:58:02.320]  most of them up and I just wanted to ask George you know it is you see me you
[2:58:02.320 --> 2:58:08.520]  seem to to see more police presence in in Mexico the the army is everywhere
[2:58:08.520 --> 2:58:13.560]  because due to the fight against the against the drug cartel fight against
[2:58:13.560 --> 2:58:18.120]  drug dealers that aren't paying their cut George see increased militarization in
[2:58:18.120 --> 2:58:23.320]  North America there's no question about it's already happening that's what we

[2:59:52.800 --> 3:00:00.400]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCM radio network
[3:00:00.400 --> 3:00:20.280]  we are back live with George Humphrey in the studio with us for a final segment
[3:00:20.280 --> 3:00:25.320]  continuing with your phone calls let's talk to Matt in the well you know what
[3:00:25.320 --> 3:00:30.040]  Dom was asking about the H1N1 briefly H1N1's being used to set up a medical
[3:00:30.040 --> 3:00:33.240]  training to set the precedent to give us shots they're now announcing are going
[3:00:33.240 --> 3:00:38.680]  to get a regular flu shot every year and the swine flu and boosters and you know
[3:00:38.680 --> 3:00:44.280]  it which is just look even the Mayo Clinic the Mayo Clinic which is the most
[3:00:44.280 --> 3:00:49.280]  establishment organization in this country is saying they wouldn't take the
[3:00:49.280 --> 3:00:53.640]  shots so and those are moral decisions these are establishment people that I
[3:00:53.640 --> 3:00:57.040]  guarantee are getting in trouble for this doctors are all over the world saying
[3:00:57.040 --> 3:01:00.320]  don't take it and they still call us conspiracy theorist that isn't gonna
[3:01:00.320 --> 3:01:04.840]  hold water you know and the amazing thing is if you look back at the quote
[3:01:04.840 --> 3:01:13.240]  swine flu it is not possible for an avian flu to coexist with the mammal
[3:01:13.240 --> 3:01:19.160]  flu and it just doesn't happen in nature and this is clearly a manmade
[3:01:19.160 --> 3:01:25.360]  genetically modified flu and now that they're finding strains of the 1918 flu
[3:01:25.360 --> 3:01:29.880]  influenza that they went up a couple years ago they went up to Spitsburg
[3:01:29.880 --> 3:01:34.160]  which is some islands north of Iceland they're controlled by Norway where they
[3:01:34.160 --> 3:01:40.480]  bury these people and got strains of the flu from people who died up there and
[3:01:40.480 --> 3:01:43.400]  it's suddenly and I remember eight years ago when they did that it was in the
[3:01:43.400 --> 3:01:46.640]  news that we said look out they're gonna bring it back and then now this dead
[3:01:46.640 --> 3:01:51.040]  flu is resurrected you know and I think it's gonna be really interesting I don't
[3:01:51.040 --> 3:01:54.800]  know what's happening in the Ukraine today but about five or six days ago they
[3:01:54.800 --> 3:01:58.640]  got a very virulent flu in the Ukraine well their government is even admitting
[3:01:58.640 --> 3:02:03.000]  that they believe that all the different flu vaccines have mutated to form this
[3:02:03.000 --> 3:02:07.560]  yeah and so we've got to keep our eye on it and but the most important thing is
[3:02:07.560 --> 3:02:13.160]  don't trust the the vaccines they don't help they'll make you sick there's
[3:02:13.160 --> 3:02:16.760]  people here right here in Austin Texas they who've taken it and who have been
[3:02:16.760 --> 3:02:22.760]  become paralyzed I know a whole bunch of people yeah absolutely and so the best
[3:02:22.760 --> 3:02:29.880]  way to protect yourself is to be healthy to eat good clean organic raw food and
[3:02:29.880 --> 3:02:35.880]  a lot of sunshine a lot of sunshine get that vitamin D and eat good clean
[3:02:35.880 --> 3:02:40.920]  organic fruits in bed let's take one more or two more calls Matt in the UK
[3:02:40.920 --> 3:02:46.080]  you're on the air go ahead hi Alex and hi George good afternoon and by the way

[3:03:25.680 --> 3:03:29.320]  bank system at the moment and there's millions and millions of people and
[3:03:29.320 --> 3:03:32.760]  trying to get back their bank charges and based on the bank site even budging
[3:03:32.760 --> 3:03:36.760]  and shops are closing every day in the UK but the government keeps saying that
[3:03:36.760 --> 3:03:40.800]  growth is here what do you guys reckon to that one
[3:03:40.800 --> 3:03:47.560]  George what's your take on the the economy deteriorating people losing their
[3:03:47.560 --> 3:03:51.960]  jobs but the media saying we've got a great economy well it is very clear is
[3:03:51.960 --> 3:03:57.240]  that in the last five years consumer spending has represented 67 to 71% of
[3:03:57.240 --> 3:04:02.160]  the whole gross domestic national product now and that was when the
[3:04:02.160 --> 3:04:07.160]  unemployment rate was about four and a half percent and the economy was was
[3:04:07.160 --> 3:04:11.600]  basically humming along today the unemployment the official rates are
[3:04:11.600 --> 3:04:16.440]  10.25 percent unemployment the real number is somewhere between 14 and a
[3:04:16.440 --> 3:04:21.680]  half to 17 percent said unemployment those are the real numbers and the
[3:04:21.680 --> 3:04:26.360]  people who are not fully employed the amount of debt is not getting better
[3:04:26.360 --> 3:04:32.280]  it's getting worse and worse and worse we have a huge number of commercial
[3:04:32.280 --> 3:04:38.720]  banking mortgage bundles that will be coming up the second round of residential

[3:07:10.720 --> 3:07:14.160]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've turned a
[3:07:14.160 --> 3:07:18.800]  tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling
[3:07:18.800 --> 3:07:24.080]  their shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[3:07:24.080 --> 3:07:28.080]  attention. Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the
[3:07:28.080 --> 3:07:33.280]  criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[3:07:33.280 --> 3:07:36.960]  constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists
[3:07:36.960 --> 3:07:40.480]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[3:07:40.480 --> 3:07:45.720]  checkout to? Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we
[3:07:45.720 --> 3:07:51.360]  have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD

[3:08:19.640 --> 3:08:30.320]  Okay I've got a correction to make. I've been announcing this is the first time that Catherine Austin Fitz has been on but she reminded me that about eight years ago or so she was on the show. But for all intents and purposes it's not her first
[3:08:30.320 --> 3:08:38.080]  rodeo but this is a maiden voyage in the last eight years so it is good good to have
[3:08:38.080 --> 3:08:40.840]  her with us but I guess if your memories wiped you don't remember something it is
[3:08:40.840 --> 3:08:46.320]  a maiden voyage. Catherine Austin Fitz, founder and managing member of Solari
[3:08:46.320 --> 3:08:50.360]  Investment Advisory Services LLC, president of the Hamilton Securities
[3:08:50.360 --> 3:08:53.480]  Group Investment Bank and Financial Software Developer, Assistant Secretary
[3:08:53.480 --> 3:08:57.720]  of Housing, Federal Housing Commissioner under Bush 1, managing
[3:08:57.720 --> 3:09:01.080]  director, managing director and member of the board of the Wall Street firm
[3:09:01.080 --> 3:09:05.120]  Dillon Reed and Co Inc. doesn't get any more elite than that. Catherine has
[3:09:05.120 --> 3:09:09.240]  designed and closed over 25 billion in transactions and investments to date and
[3:09:09.240 --> 3:09:12.880]  has led portfolio strategy for 300 billion of financial assets and
[3:09:12.880 --> 3:09:19.720]  liabilities. Solari.com is the website Solari.com. We're very honored to have her
[3:09:19.720 --> 3:09:22.960]  here and I hopefully start having her every few months instead of every decade
[3:09:22.960 --> 3:09:26.480]  or so and I want her to just tell you a little bit about herself, her journey, her
[3:09:26.480 --> 3:09:30.960]  voyage for the few of you that don't know who she is. She's on TV radio a lot over
[3:09:30.960 --> 3:09:35.800]  the years and then I want to get into what we're facing as a society, what the
[3:09:35.800 --> 3:09:40.480]  elites are doing, her take on Obama and it's great to have Catherine Austin Fitz
[3:09:40.480 --> 3:09:44.400]  on with us today. Catherine. Alex it's always a pleasure as you know I'm a
[3:09:44.400 --> 3:09:50.040]  huge fan of you and InfoWars. Well I I guess I'd forgotten that fact but but
[3:09:50.040 --> 3:09:53.480]  it's I've been emailing you for a while but maybe emailing the wrong email
[3:09:53.480 --> 3:09:57.720]  trying to get you on and I was I was crestfallen but I'm a big fan of you.
[3:09:57.720 --> 3:10:01.400]  You got the floor break down what you think's most important but first tell
[3:10:01.400 --> 3:10:05.240]  us about yourself. Well I came out of the Bush administration thinking oh my word
[3:10:05.240 --> 3:10:09.280]  the fascists are gonna kill us all we need to do something and I started an
[3:10:09.280 --> 3:10:14.760]  investment bank in Washington and our goal was to help communities finance
[3:10:14.760 --> 3:10:18.480]  with equity because rather than shipping all of our money to Wall Street and then
[3:10:18.480 --> 3:10:22.160]  hoping a little bit trickles back or shipping it all to Washington and
[3:10:22.160 --> 3:10:26.440]  hoping a little trickles the back my theory was how bad if we you know if
[3:10:26.440 --> 3:10:30.840]  we financed our own businesses and did much more locally so I started an
[3:10:30.840 --> 3:10:35.040]  investment bank one of the things we did was we were hired on competitive bid to
[3:10:35.040 --> 3:10:39.080]  be financial advisor to the US Department of Housing and Urban
[3:10:39.080 --> 3:10:45.800]  Development where I'd worked as an assistant secretary and and I we we did
[3:10:45.800 --> 3:10:49.680]  loan sales Alex and they were unbelievably successful was during the
[3:10:49.680 --> 3:10:55.000]  Clinton administration and but the corruption got worse and worse now you
[3:10:55.000 --> 3:10:57.480]  know it was terrible in the Bush administration just kept getting worse
[3:10:57.480 --> 3:11:03.080]  in the Clinton administration and we were a decision was made I was part of a
[3:11:03.080 --> 3:11:08.400]  group of people who who were saying oh my goodness with Gatt and NAFTA we're
[3:11:08.400 --> 3:11:12.720]  gonna we're gonna ship all the jobs abroad and we need to do something or
[3:11:12.720 --> 3:11:15.760]  else the American people are gonna be left high and dry we're gonna lose in
[3:11:15.760 --> 3:11:19.560]  the middle class will be wiped out how are we gonna how are we gonna develop
[3:11:19.560 --> 3:11:24.320]  new skills how are we gonna peep help people create new jobs and support small
[3:11:24.320 --> 3:11:27.960]  business so we're part of a group that we're doing working on all of that and
[3:11:27.960 --> 3:11:32.840]  literally a decision was made rather than address the real problems and help
[3:11:32.840 --> 3:11:36.640]  the American people jump the curve on the situation that instead we would
[3:11:36.640 --> 3:11:41.000]  bubble the economy and pull massive amounts of capital and re-invest them
[3:11:41.000 --> 3:11:45.840]  abroad and so this was a conscious decision and you were there on the
[3:11:45.840 --> 3:11:50.160]  inside witnessing this and and I'll tell you the greatest one of the best
[3:11:50.160 --> 3:11:56.000]  videos I've ever seen you can get it up on my blog at salieri.com slash blog is
[3:11:56.000 --> 3:12:01.600]  Sir James Goldsmith did a speaking tour trying to stop the Gatt from being
[3:12:01.600 --> 3:12:06.160]  passed in the World Trade Organization to be adopted and basically said this is
[3:12:06.160 --> 3:12:09.920]  the most frightening terrifying thing we're gonna have three billion people
[3:12:09.920 --> 3:12:14.680]  moved off the land we're you know massive unemployment worldwide we're gonna
[3:12:14.680 --> 3:12:18.120]  destroy we're gonna have massive structural unemployment the United
[3:12:18.120 --> 3:12:25.720]  States he gave this interview it's up on YouTube to Charlie Rose in 1995 and he
[3:12:25.720 --> 3:12:30.080]  predicts everything that's happening now now remember this man's a billionaire
[3:12:30.080 --> 3:12:34.000]  very successful businessman and basically said look this is the
[3:12:34.000 --> 3:12:38.080]  establishment against everybody else and he said this is going to be the most
[3:12:38.080 --> 3:12:42.080]  devastating horrible thing that has ever happened to the world it's absolutely
[3:12:42.080 --> 3:12:47.320]  crazy and he lays it all out and and what you know and so I can say the same
[3:12:47.320 --> 3:12:52.480]  thing we were on the inside we're working with the administration and we
[3:12:52.480 --> 3:12:56.200]  knew that that we were going to create massive unemployment now here's the big
[3:12:56.200 --> 3:13:01.240]  secret of the work that I did when I was in Washington during that period we
[3:13:01.240 --> 3:13:05.360]  created something Alex called Community Wizard which was a software tool that
[3:13:05.360 --> 3:13:08.880]  would allow us to look at the sources and uses of government money by place
[3:13:08.880 --> 3:13:13.480]  because America is just 3100 counties and when you look at government
[3:13:13.480 --> 3:13:20.080]  investment by place what you discover is that that a great deal of money is
[3:13:20.080 --> 3:13:25.000]  being spent to centralize economic and political power and to basically
[3:13:25.000 --> 3:13:28.800]  subsidize large corporations and all sorts of unproductive behavior whether
[3:13:28.800 --> 3:13:34.640]  it's you know people on welfare all the way up to corporations on welfare but
[3:13:34.640 --> 3:13:40.520]  let me give you a couple examples we would really find places where where HUD
[3:13:40.520 --> 3:13:44.360]  with spending this is how the Department of Housing Urban Development was
[3:13:44.360 --> 3:13:52.080]  spending $250,000 to construct or rehab an apartment building when $50,000 would
[3:13:52.080 --> 3:13:57.200]  buy and rehab a foreclosed single-family property so so we were spending four or
[3:13:57.200 --> 3:14:02.680]  five times what we needed to to get one and I went to the assistant to the
[3:14:02.680 --> 3:14:07.560]  person who ran that program in 1996 and said look you know we could get five
[3:14:07.560 --> 3:14:10.600]  homes for the price of one and they looked at me turned bright red and said
[3:14:10.600 --> 3:14:19.360]  but how would we generate fees for our friends now imagine if you will imagine
[3:14:19.360 --> 3:14:25.600]  how many how many more people would have homes today if we weren't doing things
[3:14:25.600 --> 3:14:29.920]  like that it was just a giant honeypot and the media loves to always blame poor
[3:14:29.920 --> 3:14:34.160]  people who were told oh it's the new America it's the way to build wealth
[3:14:34.160 --> 3:14:41.000]  build equity go out from the banks down to the assessors we you know we're all
[3:14:41.000 --> 3:14:45.240]  gonna basically cheat on the forms the media advertised it was okay to do and
[3:14:45.240 --> 3:14:49.520]  then the media now tries to blame the poor people they got set up and ripped
[3:14:49.520 --> 3:14:55.280]  off and given these arms and and and these balloon mortgages that's like my
[3:14:55.280 --> 3:15:00.040]  analogy Catherine Austin Fitz is like blaming a six-year-old that doesn't
[3:15:00.040 --> 3:15:04.280]  mind their parents gets out of the backyard goes in the front yard and a
[3:15:04.280 --> 3:15:09.120]  man has a puppy and candy in a in a in a van and they get in the car and get
[3:15:09.120 --> 3:15:13.040]  taken away and raped and killed you don't blame the five-year-old you blame
[3:15:13.040 --> 3:15:17.480]  the banks you blame the killer you blame the people that set this in motion
[3:15:17.480 --> 3:15:21.920]  well in fact it's called under the law it's called fraudulent inducement if I
[3:15:21.920 --> 3:15:28.840]  encourage you to to if I'm a lender and I encourage you to take on a loan and I
[3:15:28.840 --> 3:15:33.720]  know something about your future financial condition that you don't then
[3:15:33.720 --> 3:15:38.160]  that is fraudulent inducement and you may not be obligated to pay me back for
[3:15:38.160 --> 3:15:44.800]  all or a portion so in fact what happened was if you look at the big you
[3:15:44.800 --> 3:15:47.960]  know the largest banks and largest people leading the mortgage business
[3:15:47.960 --> 3:15:53.600]  everything that I knew then they knew I mean this was all known in Washington
[3:15:53.600 --> 3:15:57.640]  that the jobs were going to go abroad and incomes were generally going to fall
[3:15:57.640 --> 3:16:02.000]  and so what they were doing was they were encouraging people to take out
[3:16:02.000 --> 3:16:06.480]  loans many of whom thought they could pay back and didn't know that their income
[3:16:06.480 --> 3:16:09.880]  was going to be falling let's jump forward then we'll go back but let's
[3:16:09.880 --> 3:16:14.240]  jump forward Greg Gordon's four-part series now in the clatchy newspapers he
[3:16:14.240 --> 3:16:17.720]  got the internal documents of what you've already publicly stated and others
[3:16:17.720 --> 3:16:22.920]  have stated right that the the the pilots that pilot the private fellow
[3:16:22.920 --> 3:16:28.880]  reserve and all the major regulatory positions Goldman Sachs were telling
[3:16:28.880 --> 3:16:35.560]  everybody to invest in housing selling these securities while at the same time
[3:16:35.560 --> 3:16:40.240]  betting against them to destroy their competitors and vertically integrate
[3:16:40.240 --> 3:16:44.760]  the market to them making everybody destitute or a lower standard of living
[3:16:44.760 --> 3:16:48.960]  that's great vertical integration that's like a mosquito jamming their
[3:16:48.960 --> 3:16:53.800]  proboscis into your arm pumping and enzymes to liquidate the cells so they
[3:16:53.800 --> 3:16:58.480]  can slurp them up I mean this is just a parasite remember these firms no longer
[3:16:58.480 --> 3:17:02.880]  see themselves as serving clients they see themselves as trading for their own
[3:17:02.880 --> 3:17:07.080]  account and being part of syndicates which includes the US government which
[3:17:07.080 --> 3:17:12.160]  engage in economic warfare and and when they engage in economic warfare and when
[3:17:12.160 --> 3:17:15.800]  they trade for their own account they're using the federal credit to do it and
[3:17:15.800 --> 3:17:22.400]  and so you know if if they lose money we print paper and dig them out and and if
[3:17:22.400 --> 3:17:26.520]  they don't lose money they get to keep it it's sort of when you win and lose you
[3:17:26.520 --> 3:17:31.720]  win so what's the end game and I want to go back over the history of this and
[3:17:31.720 --> 3:17:34.920]  and more where we're going and I want you to lead the discussion throughout the
[3:17:34.920 --> 3:17:39.160]  rest of the hour Catherine Austin Fitz but I mean specifically you that you're
[3:17:39.160 --> 3:17:45.640]  agreeing that it's premeditated and predatory what's the end game what we're
[3:17:45.640 --> 3:17:51.080]  watching and it started in the latest phase started in 1995 with the
[3:17:51.080 --> 3:17:54.600]  institution of the World Trade Organization what we're watching is a
[3:17:54.600 --> 3:17:59.880]  fundamental re-engineering of how resources and planet Earth are governed
[3:17:59.880 --> 3:18:06.960]  so we're moving from a model where places are governed by government by
[3:18:06.960 --> 3:18:12.240]  sovereign governments to to a world where resources are managed by
[3:18:12.240 --> 3:18:17.600]  multinational corporations under the auspices of a world government that
[3:18:17.600 --> 3:18:22.280]  that is it you know operates very much through the financial system and the
[3:18:22.280 --> 3:18:27.040]  central banking system and if you look at the the economic model that is using
[3:18:27.040 --> 3:18:32.400]  it's not really a new model it's called central banking warfare so the central
[3:18:32.400 --> 3:18:37.440]  banks print money and the military makes sure that people take it what's
[3:18:37.440 --> 3:18:44.480]  important to understand now which is not common in in any analysis of the
[3:18:44.480 --> 3:18:50.160]  economy is that the United States and its allies have created a global taxation
[3:18:50.160 --> 3:18:56.320]  system and the way it works Alex is we print paper whether it's dollar bills
[3:18:56.320 --> 3:19:00.760]  or treasuries and then other governments around the world or central banks
[3:19:00.760 --> 3:19:05.240]  around the world by that paper and the paper goes down in value so it's a
[3:19:05.240 --> 3:19:10.000]  taxation system through the balance sheet no legislature you know every
[3:19:10.000 --> 3:19:12.760]  country in the world hasn't passed a law saying okay we're going to pay a five
[3:19:12.760 --> 3:19:16.880]  percent ties to the United States Empire every year but in fact that's what's
[3:19:16.880 --> 3:19:21.560]  happening through the currency system and now by the devaluation the tax is
[3:19:21.560 --> 3:19:26.280]  increasing right the tax is increasing and what we're watching just in the
[3:19:26.280 --> 3:19:30.660]  last two weeks with various people around the world squawking is they're
[3:19:30.660 --> 3:19:35.400]  squawking because the subsidy that needs to be extracted every year is greater
[3:19:35.400 --> 3:19:39.720]  and greater and the pain of the taxation as the economy slows down is greater
[3:19:39.720 --> 3:19:43.600]  and greater unbelievable continue breaking down this global government
[3:19:43.600 --> 3:19:47.160]  architecture when you were talking about this ten years ago the media would
[3:19:47.160 --> 3:19:50.480]  still poo poo it now they're admitting world government is here but
[3:19:50.480 --> 3:19:54.080]  simultaneously if you then say oh I don't want to be part of it they say
[3:19:54.080 --> 3:19:58.840]  this person's insane it doesn't exist I want to get your take on that amazing
[3:19:58.840 --> 3:20:04.040]  Catherine Austin fits if you believe Obama is creating runaway inflation I'll

[3:24:43.560 --> 3:24:48.120]  now this is a short segment long segment coming up Catherine I'm gonna try to
[3:24:48.120 --> 3:24:51.520]  just sit back and let you roll now because I want to hear what you think
[3:24:51.520 --> 3:24:54.160]  most important and where all this is going and how we protect ourselves but
[3:24:54.160 --> 3:24:57.880]  just to realize that open world governments being established a
[3:24:57.880 --> 3:25:02.160]  financial predatory dictatorship that wants us poor and easily controlled
[3:25:02.160 --> 3:25:08.120]  openly being stated a fake green tyranny all of this is being set up and
[3:25:08.120 --> 3:25:11.440]  we're not even having a national debate about it they're just announcing with
[3:25:11.440 --> 3:25:17.400]  one hand world government is here and it's good and and then with the other
[3:25:17.400 --> 3:25:20.880]  hand saying if you talk about it you're a dangerous cook it doesn't exist can
[3:25:20.880 --> 3:25:26.760]  you talk about that well I you know I don't I don't know anybody who says
[3:25:26.760 --> 3:25:31.480]  you're a cook if you talk about that I mean I I never get called a cook no no
[3:25:31.480 --> 3:25:35.440]  I know you don't get called a cook by the public because ban Kai moons and the
[3:25:35.440 --> 3:25:38.560]  New York Times calling for global governance but the only I mean well
[3:25:38.560 --> 3:25:44.040]  here's an example since you said it I had CBS News Jerusalem Post ADL Salon
[3:25:44.040 --> 3:25:49.720]  all yesterday all attacked me and say I'm insane none of it exists well you
[3:25:49.720 --> 3:25:53.920]  know he planet Earth divides up into what I call the pro-centralization team
[3:25:53.920 --> 3:25:58.080]  and and the pro decentralization team and if you look at how the money works
[3:25:58.080 --> 3:26:03.960]  Alex the economy has been steadily centralizing more and more money and
[3:26:03.960 --> 3:26:07.440]  so more and more people are on the dole they're on the payroll of the pro
[3:26:07.440 --> 3:26:12.120]  centralization team so you know when somebody is making money on something
[3:26:12.120 --> 3:26:18.040]  attacks me for for you know in whatever way you know in Washington we used to
[3:26:18.040 --> 3:26:23.240]  just call them the attack poodles so when the attack poodles you tell you you're
[3:26:23.240 --> 3:26:27.960]  crazy that's what they're paid to do you know it's a game it's not real so they
[3:26:27.960 --> 3:26:32.200]  know they're lying yeah they know that what one of the things that's amazing to
[3:26:32.200 --> 3:26:36.320]  me is you see more and more of people just you know they can't keep a straight
[3:26:36.320 --> 3:26:39.200]  face even there when they're saying and I was watching the clip this morning of
[3:26:39.200 --> 3:26:43.480]  the Attorney General announcing the financial fraud task force I mean talk
[3:26:43.480 --> 3:26:51.040]  about projection so so you know when he literally it looked to me like it
[3:26:51.040 --> 3:26:55.680]  couldn't keep a straight face so you know these guys know it but it you know
[3:26:55.680 --> 3:27:00.160]  it you know it's a game and the rest of us are on the pro decentralization team
[3:27:00.160 --> 3:27:04.960]  and part of the challenge is we do we have not yet created a vision of where
[3:27:04.960 --> 3:27:08.960]  the alternative is and let me let me talk about one of the places that we're
[3:27:08.960 --> 3:27:14.160]  stuck because this is so so important have I ever you probably don't know my
[3:27:14.160 --> 3:27:20.440]  my very famous red button story I was I was giving a speech to a group of people
[3:27:20.440 --> 3:27:24.520]  called spiritual frontiers Foundation International and they have a conference
[3:27:24.520 --> 3:27:28.280]  once a year Alex where they go and sit in the woods for a couple days and talk
[3:27:28.280 --> 3:27:32.280]  about how they can help our society of all spiritually so a friend of mine had
[3:27:32.280 --> 3:27:35.400]  asked me to give them a speech called how the money works an organized crime
[3:27:35.400 --> 3:27:39.720]  and it later became a very famous article called narco dollars for beginners
[3:27:39.720 --> 3:27:43.520]  and it's designed yes I've read it right it's designed to explain the
[3:27:43.520 --> 3:27:47.720]  intersection of narcotics trafficking organized crime and government and big
[3:27:47.720 --> 3:27:52.840]  corporations anyway so sort of Wall Street in Washington does drug money so
[3:27:52.840 --> 3:27:58.000]  so I'm in the middle of the speech and I'm explaining the fact we're talking
[3:27:58.000 --> 3:28:03.800]  about the the dark alliance allegations and the two hearings that Congress had
[3:28:03.800 --> 3:28:09.920]  on CIA drug dealing in South Central LA and I mentioned at the time a reporter
[3:28:09.920 --> 3:28:12.880]  that I was helping was told by the Department of Justice that the US
[3:28:12.880 --> 3:28:18.040]  economy wanders 500 billion to a train dollars a year of 500 billion to a train
[3:28:18.040 --> 3:28:23.480]  of all dirty money so that's narcotics trafficking you know illegal gambling
[3:28:23.480 --> 3:28:31.080]  tax evasion everything so so I said to this wonderful group of 100 spiritually
[3:28:31.080 --> 3:28:36.000]  evolved committed people what would happen if we stop being the global leader
[3:28:36.000 --> 3:28:39.200]  in money laundering and they said well you know the money would go to other
[3:28:39.200 --> 3:28:42.560]  stock exchanges so the New York Stock Exchange would go down and our mutual
[3:28:42.560 --> 3:28:45.600]  funds would go down and we'd have trouble rolling over the government
[3:28:45.600 --> 3:28:49.720]  deficits so we'd have you know our our taxes might go up and our government
[3:28:49.720 --> 3:28:52.800]  checks might stop and I said okay let's pretend there's a big red button up
[3:28:52.800 --> 3:28:57.960]  here on the lectern and if you push that button you can stop all hard narcotics
[3:28:57.960 --> 3:29:03.600]  trafficking in your county your state your country tomorrow thus offending the
[3:29:03.600 --> 3:29:07.680]  people who control 500 billion to a train dollars a year who here will push
[3:29:07.680 --> 3:29:12.360]  the button and this was the summer 2000 out of a hundred people dedicated to
[3:29:12.360 --> 3:29:17.440]  evolving our society spiritually guess how many would push the button how many
[3:29:17.440 --> 3:29:22.520]  one one would push the button the other 99 would not I said why would you not
[3:29:22.520 --> 3:29:26.080]  push the button they said we don't want our government checks to stop and we
[3:29:26.080 --> 3:29:29.920]  don't want our mutual funds to go down and that's the trap that's how evil gets
[3:29:29.920 --> 3:29:34.320]  you dependent on them and the police all know the government brings in most the
[3:29:34.320 --> 3:29:39.240]  drugs but they just they have to keep buying the delusion of busting kids and
[3:29:39.240 --> 3:29:42.840]  putting them in prison if you decriminalize the drugs the money would
[3:29:42.840 --> 3:29:47.160]  dry up the crime would leave it and the OD would stop and the drug abuse would
[3:29:47.160 --> 3:29:53.160]  plunge all the studies prove it stay with us we're on the march the empires
[3:29:53.160 --> 3:29:59.840]  on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[3:33:51.280 --> 3:33:55.480]  along is this new form of world government describe some of that
[3:33:55.480 --> 3:33:58.120]  world government to us and then get into whatever subjects you want to cover
[3:33:58.120 --> 3:34:01.680]  solutions how you think people can individually protect themselves
[3:34:01.680 --> 3:34:06.520]  strategies for states and counties okay well let me jump back for a second
[3:34:06.520 --> 3:34:11.800]  yeah the red button of the what I could what I call the black budget because you
[3:34:11.800 --> 3:34:14.720]  really need to understand the history of this people don't understand how could
[3:34:14.720 --> 3:34:22.280]  have gotten so bad and me not notice what happened Alex was in 1947 and 1949 we
[3:34:22.280 --> 3:34:26.920]  passed the National Security Act and the CIA Act and those two acts in
[3:34:26.920 --> 3:34:31.080]  combination allowed money to be clawed out of the federal government and
[3:34:31.080 --> 3:34:35.680]  federal budget and spent in non-transparent ways so we we created a
[3:34:35.680 --> 3:34:39.800]  secret way of funding very big projects through through the governmental
[3:34:39.800 --> 3:34:44.600]  mechanism now remember they can borrow as much money as they want and then
[3:34:44.600 --> 3:34:47.640]  something else happened because if you if you go back and you look at the
[3:34:47.640 --> 3:34:51.600]  history of financial fraud and the kind of corruption we're looking at and you
[3:34:51.600 --> 3:34:55.920]  you interview or you research and you read the people sort of dealing with it
[3:34:55.920 --> 3:35:00.680]  it all comes back to a point after World War two we're literally the government
[3:35:00.680 --> 3:35:07.160]  lost control of the technology we had the most powerful secretive black
[3:35:07.160 --> 3:35:10.720]  technology in the world including some that we brought over from the Nazis and
[3:35:10.720 --> 3:35:15.680]  literally we've created this funding mechanism that paid corporations to
[3:35:15.680 --> 3:35:21.040]  control and manage technology and a lot of what we're dealing with goes back to
[3:35:21.040 --> 3:35:27.440]  the fact that we've had since then 50 to 60 years of incredible non-transparent
[3:35:27.440 --> 3:35:32.960]  governmental flows going into basically corporate controls technology that many
[3:35:32.960 --> 3:35:38.720]  of us don't understand and and when you say well how can how can the military
[3:35:38.720 --> 3:35:42.880]  force countries all around the world to take paper that keeps going down in
[3:35:42.880 --> 3:35:48.160]  value it all comes back as you probably know to a lot of the invisible
[3:35:48.160 --> 3:35:53.480]  weaponry the satellite systems and all this incredible technology that we
[3:35:53.480 --> 3:35:59.800]  don't understand and know about I mean they brag that they're really 30 years
[3:35:59.800 --> 3:36:04.120]  advanced and they've got satellites where they can radiate somebody from space
[3:36:04.120 --> 3:36:10.720]  I mean we have a highly advanced technocracy that has walled itself off
[3:36:10.720 --> 3:36:14.960]  in military reservations private corporate reservations as you know is
[3:36:14.960 --> 3:36:20.280]  heading up a big company that developed a lot of financial software systems and
[3:36:20.280 --> 3:36:24.200]  they've rolled out the internet systems the banking systems the cashless
[3:36:24.200 --> 3:36:29.520]  systems that have now just been adopted it's like poisoning the well poisoning
[3:36:29.520 --> 3:36:33.280]  the waterhole and the deer come to it and drink and then go off and die and
[3:36:33.280 --> 3:36:36.680]  don't even know what killed them right it's just like all the technology to
[3:36:36.680 --> 3:36:40.560]  track and control us is built into the iPhone of the cell phone we just
[3:36:40.560 --> 3:36:45.400]  accepted and we're now basically like savages in this 21st century Buck
[3:36:45.400 --> 3:36:50.000]  Rogers system not even knowing what we're part of in the elite as Bill Joy
[3:36:50.000 --> 3:36:55.760]  wrote in the April issue in 2000 in Wired Magazine the elite don't need us
[3:36:55.760 --> 3:36:59.960]  anymore why the future doesn't need us well it's worse than that not only do
[3:36:59.960 --> 3:37:04.640]  they not need us but we've become very expensive I mean let's let's just look
[3:37:04.640 --> 3:37:08.680]  at the numbers in the United States in the United States if you look at that
[3:37:08.680 --> 3:37:13.600]  at the national debt before the bank bailouts each American had about thirty
[3:37:13.600 --> 3:37:19.200]  thousand dollars of national debt if you count up the social security Medicare
[3:37:19.200 --> 3:37:23.640]  and Medicaid and other contingent liabilities and you say what's the
[3:37:23.640 --> 3:37:26.920]  present value of those contingent liabilities it's about a hundred and
[3:37:26.920 --> 3:37:31.320]  thirty eight thousand dollars so more than say four times the current national
[3:37:31.320 --> 3:37:36.600]  debt and so we've literally in in one sense the baby boomers have reached a
[3:37:36.600 --> 3:37:43.320]  point where we're worth more dead than alive just looking at the numbers so if
[3:37:43.320 --> 3:37:48.720]  they succeed with this technological extermination grid that the White House
[3:37:48.720 --> 3:37:54.160]  Science Art talks about if you have if all the population manipulation and
[3:37:54.160 --> 3:37:57.880]  reduction we've seen was just testing what is the endgame I mean if they are
[3:37:57.880 --> 3:38:03.480]  able to carry this out how do you see it unfold I frankly I don't think they're
[3:38:03.480 --> 3:38:08.000]  gonna be able to carry it out I mean I'm not saying they're not gonna try but
[3:38:08.000 --> 3:38:14.920]  it's a it's a very big planet what all of us need to understand is in a world
[3:38:14.920 --> 3:38:20.760]  where let's just take as an assumption that we can be irradiated by a
[3:38:20.760 --> 3:38:27.360]  satellite by invisible weaponry from space how do you how do you push back
[3:38:27.360 --> 3:38:32.040]  against something that is that ubiquitous both in terms of ability to
[3:38:32.040 --> 3:38:35.600]  force or ability to manipulate whether it's through the media your iPhone or
[3:38:35.600 --> 3:38:41.560]  whatever how do you do it and and if you look back through history what you will
[3:38:41.560 --> 3:38:46.560]  see is is where you know John Adams said the revolution was not the war the
[3:38:46.560 --> 3:38:50.840]  revolution was in the hearts and the minds of the people and and Alex we're
[3:38:50.840 --> 3:38:58.240]  talking about a point of view and a way of being which is unbelievably black and
[3:38:58.240 --> 3:39:03.240]  if there's one thing I know about people people are fundamentally healthy and
[3:39:03.240 --> 3:39:08.200]  people are fundamentally grounded and they they just do not go along with this
[3:39:08.200 --> 3:39:13.600]  kind of blackness now it can do incredible harm on the way but but you're
[3:39:13.600 --> 3:39:17.560]  talking about ultimately a government that doesn't have what I call them the
[3:39:17.560 --> 3:39:22.240]  Chinese call the mandate of heaven you know it it's something that's based on
[3:39:22.240 --> 3:39:31.600]  on a culture which is too perverted too unhealthy and too lacking in in in the
[3:39:31.600 --> 3:39:40.120]  kind of open transparency and you know it sits in its own bell jar so you're
[3:39:40.120 --> 3:39:43.240]  saying there's going to be a revolution even within the control system and the
[3:39:43.240 --> 3:39:48.000]  elite not having the stomach to carry all the sound the problem is and
[3:39:48.000 --> 3:39:51.840]  correct me if I'm wrong if that's not what you mean by that or this revolution
[3:39:51.840 --> 3:39:55.920]  in the mind and I agree with you that's happening as members of the mid-level
[3:39:55.920 --> 3:40:00.920]  establishment really figure out my god this really is a giant extermination
[3:40:00.920 --> 3:40:07.640]  system then we see them racing to go to full robotic aircraft full robotic
[3:40:07.640 --> 3:40:14.800]  tanks full remote control systems where you have robotic factories that
[3:40:14.800 --> 3:40:19.640]  manufacture and that engage in the upkeep of the systems and then it's all
[3:40:19.640 --> 3:40:24.240]  deployed basically a terminator Skynet system is what they're building but it's
[3:40:24.240 --> 3:40:30.920]  controlled by humans but you cannot run a large operation or enterprise let alone
[3:40:30.920 --> 3:40:36.880]  a world government on force it has to have some kind of moral authority it
[3:40:36.880 --> 3:40:41.560]  has to have some kind of vision and values that inspire its members to be
[3:40:41.560 --> 3:40:45.440]  loyal force is not enough and so that's why they stage terror attacks and the
[3:40:45.440 --> 3:40:48.800]  elite play the part of the victim
[3:40:48.800 --> 3:40:54.640]  you know it depends on which one because remember that the elites are
[3:40:54.640 --> 3:41:00.280]  fighting what you've got is you've got a situation where where because the elite
[3:41:00.280 --> 3:41:05.240]  is a pretty big group but many of these people are prisoners of a system in
[3:41:05.240 --> 3:41:09.200]  other words they're part of what I call the central banking warfare model and
[3:41:09.200 --> 3:41:13.280]  that model Alex the important thing to understand about that model is to date
[3:41:13.280 --> 3:41:19.280]  it's worked I give you an example in the summer of 2000 that was a busy summer I
[3:41:19.280 --> 3:41:25.520]  was at a revival for Christian women in in Atlanta TD Jakes from Dallas your
[3:41:25.520 --> 3:41:31.360]  state had had rented the Georgia Dome and had women that aren't loosed and I
[3:41:31.360 --> 3:41:34.320]  was sitting there with a hundred thousand African-American women and I was
[3:41:34.320 --> 3:41:38.960]  taking a spiritual warfare course with a pastor and I was there with the church
[3:41:38.960 --> 3:41:48.000]  and this particular pastor had worked at DEA and TD Jakes brought George W. Bush
[3:41:48.000 --> 3:41:53.600]  in by monitor and the whole crowd jumped up cheering for George W. Bush
[3:41:53.600 --> 3:41:58.480]  including this pastor when it was over now I what I hadn't explained earlier in
[3:41:58.480 --> 3:42:02.320]  my background was I ended up in a very serious litigation with the federal
[3:42:02.320 --> 3:42:06.720]  government that went on for years and years and years and you know I always
[3:42:06.720 --> 3:42:10.240]  say I played Will Smith if you've ever seen that you've seen the movie Enemy
[3:42:10.240 --> 3:42:13.680]  to Stay right yes okay well I played Will Smith in real life it just took me a
[3:42:13.680 --> 3:42:20.080]  lot longer to find Gene Hackman anyway so so so this minister cheered cheered
[3:42:20.080 --> 3:42:24.560]  stood up and cheered and after it was over I said you know Patricia I just
[3:42:24.560 --> 3:42:29.080]  only I lost six million dollars and I almost lost my life trying to stop
[3:42:29.080 --> 3:42:32.560]  Clinton and Bush family narcotics trafficking and you just jumped up and
[3:42:32.560 --> 3:42:35.840]  cheered for this guy and she said well he's gonna be the winner and I said so
[3:42:35.840 --> 3:42:40.640]  he's a winner and I'm a loser and she said yeah that's right that's it they
[3:42:40.640 --> 3:42:44.080]  feel like they're part of the power structure even though it's going to
[3:42:44.080 --> 3:42:49.760]  destroy them well but here's the thing we have 57% of households in America now
[3:42:49.760 --> 3:42:56.480]  headed for 67% are are dependent on government money in other words you know
[3:42:56.480 --> 3:43:01.480]  I call it the tapeworm economy it's like having a tapeworm the tapeworm injects
[3:43:01.480 --> 3:43:05.960]  into you a chemical that makes you you know do what's to eat what's good for
[3:43:05.960 --> 3:43:10.280]  the tapeworm and see the tapeworm grow stronger and you go weaker right now the
[3:43:10.280 --> 3:43:14.040]  majority of us are practicing a philosophy of follow the tapeworm all that
[3:43:14.040 --> 3:43:18.680]  needs to happen Alex if you could get a critical mass they you know the hundred
[3:43:18.680 --> 3:43:22.200]  monkey syndrome if you could get six to ten percent of the people saying you
[3:43:22.200 --> 3:43:25.800]  know I just I'm not going to go along with it I'm going to withdraw because you
[3:43:25.800 --> 3:43:27.880]  don't have a fight with them you don't want to get in a fight with the
[3:43:27.880 --> 3:43:32.160]  satellites you just want to say you know something I'm pulling my money out of
[3:43:32.160 --> 3:43:36.160]  your game because your game is shrinking the problem with a centralization
[3:43:36.160 --> 3:43:40.760]  economically is it shrinking the wealth it's making a few people a little
[3:43:40.760 --> 3:43:46.080]  wealthier but it's literally like if our body was in trauma you know if you or I
[3:43:46.080 --> 3:43:49.920]  got hit by a car body was in trauma the body would preserve the blood for the
[3:43:49.920 --> 3:43:55.960]  heart the lungs and and the brain what's happening now is the economic body is
[3:43:55.960 --> 3:44:00.520]  preserving the blood for the toes and the fingers and it's cutting off the blood
[3:44:00.520 --> 3:44:05.120]  from the heart and the brain and that's why we're literally contemplating you
[3:44:05.120 --> 3:44:09.520]  know is this depopulation because you're you're literally killing off the real
[3:44:09.520 --> 3:44:14.960]  economy so you can centralize it because when you flood a country with this much
[3:44:14.960 --> 3:44:18.360]  government money and government debt to keep things going that's what you're
[3:44:18.360 --> 3:44:22.880]  doing you're basically shrinking the pie of wealth in a way that centralizes
[3:44:22.880 --> 3:44:27.440]  but but people are going along and the minute we decide you know something
[3:44:27.440 --> 3:44:33.760]  this is really unhealthy this can't go in any place that's good for us our
[3:44:33.760 --> 3:44:39.320]  children our grandchildren and we start to shift in very this does not have to
[3:44:39.320 --> 3:44:44.840]  be picking a fight it's just withdrawing so if we turn off our TVs so we
[3:44:44.840 --> 3:44:49.640]  withdraw our time if we if we withdraw our money from the big financial
[3:44:49.640 --> 3:44:56.400]  institutions in the big banks and start what I call demonetizing if you if you
[3:44:56.400 --> 3:45:01.000]  come into any county in America Alex you will find you know literally one
[3:45:01.000 --> 3:45:06.240]  person has got their savings and bank CDs that are in a large New York bank
[3:45:06.240 --> 3:45:11.760]  another one has their IRA and stock of that same large New York bank and their
[3:45:11.760 --> 3:45:15.560]  best friend is borrowing money from that New York back on their credit card for
[3:45:15.560 --> 3:45:21.200]  23 percent so the first two women are making three to four percent if they're
[3:45:21.200 --> 3:45:26.480]  lucky and and their friend is borrowing that money back for 23 percent well why
[3:45:26.480 --> 3:45:31.160]  do they need a big New York bank to be in the middle of them exactly they should
[3:45:31.160 --> 3:45:36.440]  be loaning to each other and keeping it all local right let me let me give you
[3:45:36.440 --> 3:45:42.000]  another example in Tennessee because there is so here's where the opportunity
[3:45:42.000 --> 3:45:46.160]  is when you start to dig in and you bring transparency to how the money
[3:45:46.160 --> 3:45:52.200]  works in a place and you say look let's withdraw from the tapeworm system in a
[3:45:52.200 --> 3:45:56.240]  way that makes us money because because the problem we have is our wealth is
[3:45:56.240 --> 3:46:00.320]  shrinking so we need to find a way to withdraw from the system that that
[3:46:00.320 --> 3:46:05.240]  expands our wealth and and stops us from getting drained financially so for
[3:46:05.240 --> 3:46:10.440]  example I can't tell you how many communities and counties where you will
[3:46:10.440 --> 3:46:17.240]  find government contracts paying a corporation up to 100 and 150 dollars
[3:46:17.240 --> 3:46:21.760]  an hour to do something that someone in that community would love to do for 25
[3:46:21.760 --> 3:46:25.440]  dollars an hour plus health care and they should go in and take control of
[3:46:25.440 --> 3:46:28.720]  their counties and make the county spend the money with the locals but they
[3:46:28.720 --> 3:46:33.720]  don't because one big fat cat wants to keep it all for themselves just at a
[3:46:33.720 --> 3:46:37.720]  primitive level they don't want anybody else in the little town getting up at
[3:46:37.720 --> 3:46:43.120]  sea they have the same new the same neurosis that the elite has an instinctive
[3:46:43.120 --> 3:46:47.600]  need to keep people down around them but in the process they destroy they
[3:46:47.600 --> 3:46:51.040]  destroy their own future well but I think most people are scared it's
[3:46:51.040 --> 3:46:55.680]  complicated it's scared how do you organize to do something that's effective
[3:46:55.680 --> 3:47:01.240]  now let me give you an example in Florida and Tennessee the I'm sure it's more
[3:47:01.240 --> 3:47:06.400]  states to the food that we know I live in Tennessee 20% of our population is
[3:47:06.400 --> 3:47:14.600]  now in food stamps 20% Alex now there was a woman in Florida who who worked all
[3:47:14.600 --> 3:47:19.800]  her life and then lost her job when the economy went down she got food stamps
[3:47:19.800 --> 3:47:23.120]  she had problem with the food stamps called the food stamp hotline the
[3:47:23.120 --> 3:47:27.400]  customer service line to discover that the woman she was talking to who was
[3:47:27.400 --> 3:47:32.520]  helping you know doing customer service for her food stamps worked for JP Morgan
[3:47:32.520 --> 3:47:39.080]  Chase in India okay so the government is paying her not to work at the same
[3:47:39.080 --> 3:47:43.280]  time the government is paying somebody in India to do a job she could do this
[3:47:43.280 --> 3:47:47.720]  doesn't make any sense because the government is paying twice but it's a
[3:47:47.720 --> 3:47:53.160]  payoff the government's doing to India to go into the globalist model well
[3:47:53.160 --> 3:47:57.000]  here's the thing if you if I run a government contract through a stock
[3:47:57.000 --> 3:48:02.840]  that's trading it at 20 times earnings so so let's say my eye my stock is
[3:48:02.840 --> 3:48:07.120]  trading at 20 times earnings I give a government contract for a hundred
[3:48:07.120 --> 3:48:11.880]  million dollars they make 10 million in profit on that government contract their
[3:48:11.880 --> 3:48:16.600]  stock goes up 200 million that gives them the capital gains they need to to
[3:48:16.600 --> 3:48:21.360]  donate to elections if you look at campaign donations the majority of that
[3:48:21.360 --> 3:48:26.600]  money comes from from capital gains on either real estate or stock and and the
[3:48:26.600 --> 3:48:30.800]  way you get a stock to go up is by giving it lots of government contracts or
[3:48:30.800 --> 3:48:34.600]  government purchases are changing the rules I have a great article I wrote
[3:48:34.600 --> 3:48:38.640]  called Dylan Reed in the aristocracy of stock profits and it was about how much
[3:48:38.640 --> 3:48:44.080]  money a stock at prisons private prison stock trades on how many beds it has so
[3:48:44.080 --> 3:48:49.040]  thinking this is slavery at the time I wrote the article every additional bed
[3:48:49.040 --> 3:48:53.280]  you get cost your stock to go up twenty five thousand dollars so the more if you
[3:48:53.280 --> 3:48:59.040]  can pass a law that says you know mandated sentences are longer the stocks
[3:48:59.040 --> 3:49:03.120]  will go up just on the passage of the law anticipating the and the average
[3:49:03.120 --> 3:49:09.000]  American doesn't know that big banks that own and control prison complexes
[3:49:09.000 --> 3:49:14.840]  openly come in and give money right to build more prisons and you know to lobby
[3:49:14.840 --> 3:49:18.080]  with your tax money to build the prison that they then make the profit off of
[3:49:18.080 --> 3:49:22.440]  and they lobby to pass more laws and it's the alcohol and cigarette lobbies
[3:49:22.440 --> 3:49:26.640]  that kill more than anybody who are the biggest lobbyist for the drug war well
[3:49:26.640 --> 3:49:32.560]  what's interesting is once what if if we reached a point where where a
[3:49:32.560 --> 3:49:36.600]  significant and I mean the six to ten percent like the hundred monkey
[3:49:36.600 --> 3:49:41.120]  syndrome if we could get a critical mass of people to see how the game is played
[3:49:41.120 --> 3:49:45.840]  and how it works around the money that's when things start to change now
[3:49:45.840 --> 3:49:53.400]  what you know in 1997 and let me let me tell you the story in 1997 remember I'm
[3:49:53.400 --> 3:49:59.040]  trying to persuade the pension funds to reinvest in America you know in a way
[3:49:59.040 --> 3:50:03.840]  that really could have made the pension funds tremendous amounts of money compared
[3:50:03.840 --> 3:50:08.880]  to the way they've lost money and all these frauds so 1997 I had a I had a
[3:50:08.880 --> 3:50:13.960]  wonderful board of pension fund leaders including the president of the CalPERS
[3:50:13.960 --> 3:50:18.760]  which is the largest pension fund in the country and and I gave them my
[3:50:18.760 --> 3:50:23.520]  presentation of how we could reinvest in America in a way that would make a lot
[3:50:23.520 --> 3:50:27.600]  of money for the pension funds and the president of CalPERS looked at me and he
[3:50:27.600 --> 3:50:31.440]  said you don't understand it's too late they've given up on the country they're
[3:50:31.440 --> 3:50:38.120]  moving all the money out starting in the fall and that was 1997 and so the fall
[3:50:38.120 --> 3:50:43.880]  of 1997 was the beginning of federal fiscal 1998 and that's when four trillion
[3:50:43.880 --> 3:50:48.840]  four trillion dollars in 98 the next four years went missing from the federal
[3:50:48.840 --> 3:50:52.560]  government and and we made a decision to move all the money out of the country
[3:50:52.560 --> 3:50:57.080]  Alex and we covered it up by bubbling with the housing bubble and this huge
[3:50:57.080 --> 3:51:03.520]  debt bubble stay there final segment this is riveting air and aqua.com is your

[3:52:13.640 --> 3:52:18.680]  the Americans at home. I have a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and
[3:52:18.680 --> 3:52:23.480]  they really are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as
[3:52:23.480 --> 3:52:28.520]  American citizens to pay attention. Full of the Republic identifies the enemies
[3:52:28.520 --> 3:52:33.600]  of our nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty
[3:52:33.600 --> 3:52:37.640]  and on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke and
[3:52:37.640 --> 3:52:41.680]  arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we
[3:52:41.680 --> 3:52:45.400]  make the checkout to? Today seems like nobody does care and right now in
[3:52:45.400 --> 3:52:51.400]  Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the

[3:54:02.400 --> 3:54:24.080]  Katherine Austin Fitz is a very impressive lady and I'm glad we hooked
[3:54:24.080 --> 3:54:26.960]  back up with her and have her on mother she just said she'll come back on in two
[3:54:26.960 --> 3:54:31.480]  weeks and I am really looking forward to that. I was just flattered for her to
[3:54:31.480 --> 3:54:34.560]  tell me that she actually bought a copy of the Obama deception. We're gonna mail
[3:54:34.560 --> 3:54:37.920]  her a copy of Fall of the Republic. I don't have time to play it but we have
[3:54:37.920 --> 3:54:42.600]  the CNN clip now. It'll be up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com after the
[3:54:42.600 --> 3:54:49.120]  show. CNN talking about Fall of the Republic and not in a nice way. Again,
[3:54:49.120 --> 3:54:55.200]  CBS News, Jerusalem Post, a whole bunch of mainstream publications said that I'm
[3:54:55.200 --> 3:55:02.400]  incredibly influential, dangerous, charismatic. What was one quote? Incredibly
[3:55:02.400 --> 3:55:06.840]  popular and believe me, I don't like this as a power trip. I know it's
[3:55:06.840 --> 3:55:10.560]  dangerous going up against these folks. Katherine, what does it mean though?
[3:55:10.560 --> 3:55:14.080]  Because on the street you were just saying during the break people are
[3:55:14.080 --> 3:55:18.160]  saying we're mainstream now. I mean people are really listening to us. We're
[3:55:18.160 --> 3:55:26.960]  going from being kind of cutting edge to being past saying in a way. But I mean
[3:55:26.960 --> 3:55:31.040]  does that creep you out to know that the system is going from being arrogant
[3:55:31.040 --> 3:55:36.800]  about us to now actually sitting up and going, you know, danger will Robinson. I
[3:55:36.800 --> 3:55:42.320]  mean I see them putting out alarm flares. Remember, the corporate media will
[3:55:42.320 --> 3:55:48.400]  always shift to protect its channel. So what happens is, you know, you do
[3:55:48.400 --> 3:55:53.960]  something wonderful and it starts to draw a lot of interest and support and
[3:55:53.960 --> 3:55:59.560]  they will suddenly shift to try and co-op that audience back in something
[3:55:59.560 --> 3:56:03.560]  that's like but not the same thing. But don't they know that's not
[3:56:03.560 --> 3:56:07.760]  going to work anymore because they've lost all credibility? Well, that's why
[3:56:07.760 --> 3:56:11.160]  they keep getting closer and closer to what we're saying because
[3:56:11.160 --> 3:56:15.240]  they're trying to protect the channel as our audience grows. What was Obama?
[3:56:15.240 --> 3:56:21.040]  Because we talked during the break. What is Obama all about? Who is Obama? Well, I
[3:56:21.040 --> 3:56:26.600]  think Obama was somebody who was profiled. In other words, you know, a lot of
[3:56:26.600 --> 3:56:32.640]  smart money said, look, we have engaged in massive financial fraud. This thing
[3:56:32.640 --> 3:56:38.560]  is a bubble and and essentially we're gonna pump and dump it but on the dump
[3:56:38.560 --> 3:56:43.960]  if we don't do something, we are really gonna have trouble maintaining control.
[3:56:43.960 --> 3:56:49.840]  And so I think the question for them was who, you know, what kind of candidate and
[3:56:49.840 --> 3:56:57.920]  what kind of sort of new president could maintain, you know, could maintain the
[3:56:57.920 --> 3:57:02.160]  control? Because remember, what you always want to do is present people with a
[3:57:02.160 --> 3:57:06.320]  style choice that makes them feel good so you don't have to give them any money.
[3:57:06.320 --> 3:57:10.440]  What is happening is we're fundamentally renegotiating the
[3:57:10.440 --> 3:57:14.800]  relationship between labor and capital and they needed somebody who could
[3:57:14.800 --> 3:57:19.960]  consolidate their position. And what we've seen is from the time that Obama
[3:57:19.960 --> 3:57:26.840]  became the candidate, he has used his political credibility to essentially
[3:57:26.840 --> 3:57:32.600]  make possible a 12 trillion dollar gift to the banking system. And it's quite
[3:57:32.600 --> 3:57:38.280]  extraordinary, Alex, because 12 trillion dollars is the total amount of money that
[3:57:38.280 --> 3:57:42.200]  the United States government has borrowed since the Revolutionary War. So that
[3:57:42.200 --> 3:57:47.560]  includes paying for World War II, World War I, Vietnam, and that amount of money
[3:57:47.560 --> 3:57:53.040]  we've gifted to the banking system. Now, that's an enormous that's probably the
[3:57:53.040 --> 3:57:57.160]  most impressive political feat in the in the history of the planet. It's
[3:57:57.160 --> 3:58:01.440]  incredible. And he did all this while saying he was balancing the budget and
[3:58:01.440 --> 3:58:07.800]  was going to cut things. Well, what's amazing is because there's so many
[3:58:07.800 --> 3:58:15.720]  people who I see still supporting Obama because they can't fathom that that
[3:58:15.720 --> 3:58:22.080]  the president is not, is a fashion statement as opposed to a real manager of
[3:58:22.080 --> 3:58:28.080]  power. Solari.com, a lot of great investment information there, so much to
