[00:00.000 --> 00:13.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:13.200 --> 00:21.960]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:21.960 --> 00:28.760]  welcome to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight I'll be your host today we have a
[00:28.760 --> 00:33.360]  busy show we've got Joe Biggs joining us to talk about Barrett Brown and then
[00:33.360 --> 00:37.320]  we're going to talk to Barrett Brown from inside prison that's going to happen
[00:37.320 --> 00:41.180]  in the second hour we're also going to talk to Paul Joseph Watson about
[00:41.180 --> 00:45.800]  feminism political correctness the video that he did last week also Anthony
[00:45.800 --> 00:51.960]  Gucci Artie will be in studio talking to us about the FTC trying to assert its
[00:51.960 --> 00:55.880]  authority now over the internet it's not just enough that we have one little
[00:55.880 --> 00:59.680]  empire building bureaucracy that wants to basically assert control over the
[00:59.680 --> 01:04.840]  internet doesn't matter about new net neutrality basically they just want to
[01:04.840 --> 01:08.360]  get their authority established over the internet that's why this is all
[01:08.360 --> 01:12.720]  happening there's pushback against that in the Congress there's also pushback
[01:12.720 --> 01:19.920]  against the ATF we were trying to ban ammunition as being cop killers look any
[01:19.920 --> 01:23.880]  ammunition can be a cop killer and there's nothing unique about this
[01:23.880 --> 01:28.520]  particular ammunition and soft body armor that the police wear there's a
[01:28.520 --> 01:33.000]  lot of ammunition that could be banned under that pretense what they have done
[01:33.000 --> 01:37.280]  is essentially set up a regime where everything is prohibited unless it's
[01:37.280 --> 01:42.680]  expressly permitted and of course it is unelected perpetual bureaucracies that
[01:42.680 --> 01:46.560]  get to decide what is permitted and what isn't they write the rules the
[01:46.560 --> 01:50.760]  rules the laws has been abdicated by the Congress to them it's time for the
[01:50.760 --> 01:54.280]  Congress to take it back and there are some signs at least some talk the
[01:54.280 --> 01:59.320]  Congress wants to do that we have Rand Paul urging supporters to write to the
[01:59.320 --> 02:04.520]  ATF and say stop this Obama ammo ban because of course they are coming after
[02:04.520 --> 02:07.880]  ammunition they've been doing that since Obama went in that's one of the big
[02:07.880 --> 02:12.600]  changes under Obama the gun controllers have realized that if you don't have a
[02:12.600 --> 02:18.080]  gun with ammunition you've got just a club and that's what they've been going
[02:18.080 --> 02:22.080]  after we'll talk about that we're also going to talk about now doing something
[02:22.080 --> 02:27.200]  besides begging these out of control empire building bureaucracies to respect
[02:27.200 --> 02:32.320]  our rights that are guaranteed under the Constitution they supposedly are there
[02:32.320 --> 02:36.480]  to uphold of course they're not elected by us they're not accountable to us we
[02:36.480 --> 02:40.000]  have to rely on the Congress to do something about it we now have some
[02:40.000 --> 02:44.000]  congressman saying you know what we've had so many criminal actions so many
[02:44.000 --> 02:50.800]  scandals from the ATF it's time we just shut that agency down I couldn't agree
[02:50.800 --> 02:55.120]  more so we're going to talk about that that's a big story another empire
[02:55.120 --> 02:58.920]  building bureaucracy the EPA they're out there trying to shut down
[02:58.920 --> 03:02.560]  wood stoves and of course Rob dude at a report on that a few weeks ago maybe
[03:02.560 --> 03:06.400]  about a month ago them trying to step up the regulations but the interesting
[03:06.400 --> 03:11.880]  thing to me is we now have states coming in and saying you've gone too far we're
[03:11.880 --> 03:16.360]  not going to allow you to take down wood stoves and of course we've been
[03:16.360 --> 03:19.400]  reporting on this for a long time one of the first stories that I covered here
[03:19.400 --> 03:24.320]  when I came to Info Wars is a story that it was already working on and that was
[03:24.320 --> 03:29.840]  in North Carolina we had the EPA directly hooking people up to diesel
[03:29.840 --> 03:35.280]  tailpipes literally hooking them up to diesel tailpipes looking for people
[03:35.280 --> 03:41.080]  screening for people who had respiratory issues who had heart issues Lisa
[03:41.080 --> 03:47.080]  Jackson who was then the head of the EPA later taken out by an email scandal
[03:47.080 --> 03:50.760]  interestingly enough we'll talk about Hillary Clinton's email problems but
[03:50.760 --> 03:55.080]  Lisa Jackson went before Congress and said we're not talking about making
[03:55.080 --> 04:00.960]  people sick we're talking about deaths and she made the amazing statement that
[04:00.960 --> 04:05.000]  more people were dying from fine particulate matter than were from cancer
[04:05.000 --> 04:09.080]  nevertheless they went in and they did human experimentation at 70 times the
[04:09.080 --> 04:15.040]  level the EPA said was a problem had banned what was the purpose we said well
[04:15.040 --> 04:19.040]  of course we don't believe that the fine particulate matter is that dangerous it
[04:19.040 --> 04:24.520]  was obviously a lie but what they did was they used that to they were trying to
[04:24.520 --> 04:28.240]  get people who to get sick so they could extend their regulations now of course
[04:28.240 --> 04:33.040]  if it really was that dangerous they should have been tried under a war
[04:33.040 --> 04:37.200]  crimes act for human experimentation we're going to talk about that as well
[04:37.200 --> 04:43.160]  because we've got a bio weapon Birkhold area pseudo molly eye that got out of the
[04:43.160 --> 04:47.440]  lab in Tulane and we're going to talk about why they're doing these kind of
[04:47.440 --> 04:51.800]  experiments gain a function for deadly bacteria stay with us we'll be right
[04:51.800 --> 04:54.040]  back
[04:59.160 --> 05:03.760]  the government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo at

[08:21.520 --> 08:25.720]  I'll be your host today we have a busy show we've got Joe Biggs going to be
[08:25.720 --> 08:29.720]  joining us in studio in the next hour and we're going to talk to Barrett Brown
[08:29.720 --> 08:34.440]  who is Barrett Brown well many of you know him very well he's actually I
[08:34.440 --> 08:39.360]  think become the poster child for how the government wants to shut down free
[08:39.360 --> 08:43.640]  speech to shut down journalists of course this administration has gone after
[08:43.640 --> 08:48.720]  more journalists than all the other previous administrations combined since
[08:48.720 --> 08:54.800]  1917 with the National Espionage Act that was passed then they have also
[08:54.800 --> 08:59.800]  stepped up the penalties under the computer fraud abuse act that is the
[08:59.800 --> 09:02.960]  act that they go after hackers with now of course Barrett Brown is not a hacker
[09:02.960 --> 09:08.240]  nobody ever accused him of being a hacker he's a journalist who linked to some
[09:08.240 --> 09:12.960]  wiki leak documents he was a journalist who was a pain in the side of the
[09:12.960 --> 09:19.600]  federal government talking about their cyber exploits their hacks they're the
[09:19.600 --> 09:23.160]  ones who do the hacks as Aaron Schwartz pointed out they're the ones who create
[09:23.160 --> 09:26.040]  them they're the ones who fund them they're the ones who usually carry them
[09:26.040 --> 09:30.840]  out and of course they don't like that being pointed out he had an interesting
[09:30.840 --> 09:35.120]  article basically when he was going through his trial where they accused him
[09:35.120 --> 09:41.760]  falsely of threatening an FBI agent when he was retweeting what a Fox News
[09:41.760 --> 09:46.200]  commentator had said calling for the assassination of Julian Assange he
[09:46.200 --> 09:51.280]  retweeted that verbatim and they took that and said he's threatening an FBI
[09:51.280 --> 09:55.640]  agent so they prosecuted him for that they prosecuted him for the link they
[09:55.640 --> 10:01.160]  prosecuted him for a lot of other nonsense and they gagged this proceedings
[10:01.160 --> 10:05.720]  during the trial so after he was sentenced he put out a post on the Daily
[10:05.720 --> 10:11.560]  Bee said my post cyberpunk indentured servitude and of course what he means by
[10:11.560 --> 10:15.720]  that is they gave him an eight hundred thousand dollar nearly a million dollar
[10:15.720 --> 10:20.400]  fine that he has to pay back to strat for and we'll talk about whose strat for
[10:20.400 --> 10:24.480]  is if you don't know whose strat for is he's gonna have to pay that back to
[10:24.480 --> 10:28.440]  strat for he has to do another five years I believe that they're extending it
[10:28.440 --> 10:34.000]  by another 63 months I don't think that includes time served Joe can correct me
[10:34.000 --> 10:37.280]  on that when he gets in here and of course we can talk to Barrett he is now
[10:37.280 --> 10:41.600]  currently in prison I thought he had a great quote the way he was getting
[10:41.600 --> 10:45.400]  railroaded the way we're all being railroaded on so many different issues he
[10:45.400 --> 10:53.000]  said we no longer have the rule of law we have the rule of law enforcement we
[10:53.000 --> 10:57.800]  have law enforcement that rules they do whatever they wish or the president or
[10:57.800 --> 11:01.400]  the bureaucracy and we have a lot of news about the bureaucracy that's out of
[11:01.400 --> 11:04.560]  line we got Anthony Gutiarty is going to be joining us in the third hour
[11:04.560 --> 11:09.880]  talking about how the FCC is now trying to build their empire on the back of our
[11:09.880 --> 11:15.760]  freedoms on the internet we have the F the FCC that's been coming in and saying
[11:15.760 --> 11:19.800]  we're going to control it now the FTC is coming in and saying we want to get in
[11:19.800 --> 11:25.160]  on the ads and so we're going to exert control over ads that people run so
[11:25.160 --> 11:28.800]  there is no limit to what these bureaucracies are going to do if we
[11:28.800 --> 11:33.840]  don't shut them down but quickly before we move on to some of the other news and
[11:33.840 --> 11:37.320]  I really haven't been following this Hillary Clinton story that carefully
[11:37.320 --> 11:42.240]  because you know there's been so many criminal actions so many scandals and
[11:42.240 --> 11:46.160]  the Republicans never seem to follow through on any of these things of course
[11:46.160 --> 11:51.600]  she should go to jail she should be prosecuted Lisa Jackson didn't go to
[11:51.600 --> 11:56.160]  jail for what she did the former director of the EPA but she did get thrown
[11:56.160 --> 12:01.120]  out of the EPA will this disqualify Hillary Clinton of course not not in the
[12:01.120 --> 12:05.120]  eyes of most people and not in the eyes of the people who have given her so much
[12:05.120 --> 12:10.840]  money there's interesting story up on info wars.com today a representative
[12:10.840 --> 12:15.080]  Trey Gowdy from South Carolina says remember that iconic picture of Hillary
[12:15.080 --> 12:20.240]  on her blackberry we don't have any emails from that day that was the
[12:20.240 --> 12:25.720]  picture that they put up for her her book tour hard choices I guess the hard
[12:25.720 --> 12:31.440]  choices were which email account should I use this particular discussion don't
[12:31.440 --> 12:36.320]  want to do this in secret illegally shall use my private server or should I
[12:36.320 --> 12:40.960]  use the legitimate one that I'm supposed to use in the State Department we have
[12:40.960 --> 12:44.880]  Obama in an interesting interview on NBC news let's play that clip he had kind
[12:44.880 --> 12:49.680]  of implies that he never got any email from Hillary Clinton ever here we go
[12:49.680 --> 12:53.040]  let's play that clip this president when did you first learn that Hillary
[12:53.040 --> 12:58.680]  Clinton use an email system outside the US government for official business while
[12:58.680 --> 13:03.360]  she was Secretary of State the same time everybody else learned it through news
[13:03.360 --> 13:09.000]  reports were you disappointed let me just say that Hillary Clinton is and has
[13:09.000 --> 13:14.160]  been an outstanding public servant she was a great Secretary of State for me
[13:14.160 --> 13:18.800]  the policy of my administration is to encourage transparency and that's why
[13:18.800 --> 13:25.000]  my emails the blackberry that I carry around all those things are available
[13:25.000 --> 13:35.280]  and archived and I'm glad that Hillary is instructed that those emails that had
[13:35.280 --> 13:38.600]  to do with official business need to be disclosed well you say that you have the
[13:38.600 --> 13:42.200]  most transparent administration ever he said it again just a couple of weeks ago
[13:42.200 --> 13:47.400]  how does this square with that well the fact that she's gonna be putting them
[13:47.400 --> 13:53.000]  forward will allow us to make sure that people have the information they need he
[13:53.000 --> 13:56.080]  doesn't have a transparent administration the only thing transparent
[13:56.080 --> 13:59.680]  about this administration is its criminality and the fact that he is a
[13:59.680 --> 14:05.600]  transparent liar now Rand Paul is urging supporters to stop Obama's latest
[14:05.600 --> 14:11.120]  ammunition ban and of course if you've got a gun without ammunition you've got
[14:11.120 --> 14:15.040]  a club and that's what they've been trying to do ever since Obama came into
[14:15.040 --> 14:19.120]  office if you remember right away when he came into office he stopped the
[14:19.120 --> 14:23.600]  recycling of brass from the military into the commercial market now of course
[14:23.600 --> 14:28.080]  the military makes its own ammunition it has its own factories it doesn't buy it
[14:28.080 --> 14:33.600]  on the retail market so they stopped this and that in and of itself would have
[14:33.600 --> 14:38.760]  created a massive disruption in ammunition prices and supplies we had
[14:38.760 --> 14:42.880]  some senators who said you've got us you got to turn this policy back what they
[14:42.880 --> 14:47.280]  were going to do was take the brass and instead of sending it to private
[14:47.280 --> 14:51.520]  manufacturers to make into ammunition to sell in the retail market they were
[14:51.520 --> 14:55.640]  going to spend extra money to crush it into scrap metal and sell it to China
[14:55.640 --> 14:59.240]  hey that sounds like a great idea let's spend more money so we can sell it for
[14:59.240 --> 15:03.040]  less but of course that'll keep ammunition out of the hands of Americans
[15:03.040 --> 15:06.840]  so there was a pushback senator said stop this I said all right we're gonna
[15:06.840 --> 15:11.520]  reverse that policy we found out two years later actually was three years
[15:11.520 --> 15:16.880]  later we found out that Fort Drum in New York was still doing that they listed
[15:16.880 --> 15:21.320]  on their recycling program how they were crushing brass and selling it as scrap
[15:21.320 --> 15:25.760]  so even though they do this and say they're going to comply the bureaucracy
[15:25.760 --> 15:31.080]  doesn't comply with that so I think you know it's a good thing for us to register
[15:31.080 --> 15:36.760]  our our the fact that we don't like what the ATF is doing send them a letter as
[15:36.760 --> 15:40.800]  Rand Paul said I think we should all speak up all the time but you know what
[15:40.800 --> 15:45.080]  the ATF doesn't really care what you think none of these bureaucracies care
[15:45.080 --> 15:48.800]  what you think they create their own laws they put them up and say we want a
[15:48.800 --> 15:54.480]  public commenting period they don't care what you say just as the FCC didn't
[15:54.480 --> 16:00.160]  even show the regulation that's the next level making it clear that they are so
[16:00.160 --> 16:03.760]  arrogant about what we want to see they don't even care what our response is
[16:03.760 --> 16:07.680]  they've passed it now for over a week we still haven't seen the legislation that
[16:07.680 --> 16:11.360]  they've created I say legislation it's regulation it's the same effect our
[16:11.360 --> 16:16.280]  Congress has abdicated its lawful authority to pass the laws to these
[16:16.280 --> 16:20.160]  bureaucracies that they've created that perpetuate forever and are totally
[16:20.160 --> 16:24.520]  unaccountable to us what is the eight when we send a letter to the ATF and
[16:24.520 --> 16:28.840]  they look at it and I say well gee you know David doesn't like what I'm going
[16:28.840 --> 16:33.480]  to do in terms of banning ammunition I guess I should listen to him because he
[16:33.480 --> 16:37.800]  might not vote me in next time you know they don't have to stand election they
[16:37.800 --> 16:41.520]  get appointed they're there forever here's the way you do it
[16:41.520 --> 16:46.800]  world net daily has a story from Cheryl Cheryl Chumley GOP to shutter scandal
[16:46.800 --> 16:52.680]  ridden ATF shut them down cut off their funding shut them down this is
[16:52.680 --> 16:58.160]  representative Jen Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin has introduced legislation to
[16:58.160 --> 17:04.400]  abolish the ATF and transfer its duties in part to the FBI the ATF he says is
[17:04.400 --> 17:10.320]  scandal ridden largely duplicative agency that lacks a clear vision it's
[17:10.320 --> 17:16.160]  quote-unquote framework is an affront to the Second Amendment absolutely yet
[17:16.160 --> 17:21.440]  another reason why Congress should pass the ATF elimination act now that's what
[17:21.440 --> 17:25.240]  you should be writing on don't don't waste any you can send the letter to the
[17:25.240 --> 17:29.640]  ATF but if you want to really get behind something send letters to the
[17:29.640 --> 17:36.320]  Republican congressman tell them to pass the ATF elimination act shut them
[17:36.320 --> 17:41.440]  down they should have been shut down decades ago decades ago they were a
[17:41.440 --> 17:48.120]  vestige of alcohol prohibition they need to be shut down now we've also we've
[17:48.120 --> 17:52.520]  got 200 lawmakers who wrote to the ATF saying you know don't don't do this but
[17:52.520 --> 17:56.160]  that's not the way to go don't send them a letter don't beg with them just shut
[17:56.160 --> 17:59.680]  them down it's been long enough now if that doesn't fly she points out that
[17:59.680 --> 18:04.360]  representative Tom Rooney of Florida has introduced the protecting Second
[18:04.360 --> 18:10.080]  Amendment rights in direct response to the ATF's crackdown on AR-15 type ammo
[18:10.080 --> 18:16.440]  stripping the agency of its ability to regulate ammunition I think that's a
[18:16.440 --> 18:20.840]  great idea the problem is is that you know the Second Amendment is about
[18:20.840 --> 18:25.240]  keeping and bearing arms that includes guns that includes ammunition that
[18:25.240 --> 18:31.040]  includes knives that includes swords ninchucks whatever those are arms those
[18:31.040 --> 18:35.800]  are personal arms there should be no infringement of that it's always going
[18:35.800 --> 18:40.560]  to be a gradual process we all know that if they are successful in banning one
[18:40.560 --> 18:44.920]  particular bullet they're going to come back and ban other bullets it's just a
[18:44.920 --> 18:50.600]  long process and as the NRA has pointed out very popular rounds of
[18:50.600 --> 18:54.000]  ammunition are larger more powerful than the one that they're talking about
[18:54.000 --> 19:00.760]  banning right now shut the ATF down we don't need them they're corrupt they
[19:00.760 --> 19:04.320]  ran fast and furious it's time that we shut the entire thing down another
[19:04.320 --> 19:11.960]  agency that has gone off the rails the EPA is now talking about making more
[19:11.960 --> 19:16.560]  rules about burning wood and wood stoves and as I pointed out the last segment
[19:16.560 --> 19:21.720]  Rob do did a report on this I've done reports on the basis of what the EPA is
[19:21.720 --> 19:24.800]  trying to do and that is saying that they have to stop fine particulate matter
[19:24.800 --> 19:28.360]  Lisa Jackson lied and said more people are dying from fine particulate matter
[19:28.360 --> 19:34.080]  than are from cancer not true yet meanwhile the EPA hooks people up to
[19:34.080 --> 19:41.280]  diesel tailpipes so they can shut down your wood stove and people in Missouri
[19:41.280 --> 19:46.200]  and Michigan the legislators there have said they're not going to enforce these
[19:46.200 --> 19:50.480]  EPA bans precisely the point shut them down at the state level with state
[19:50.480 --> 19:53.760]  nullification shut down these agencies in Washington stay with us we'll be right

[23:59.440 --> 24:08.040]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[24:10.320 --> 24:14.440]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your host on this Monday
[24:14.440 --> 24:19.320]  March 9th 2015 we're gonna be joined in the next hour as I said before with
[24:19.320 --> 24:23.600]  Barrett Brown is going to be coming on the show talking to us from prison we're
[24:23.600 --> 24:29.240]  going to have Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs retired who got to know Barrett Brown
[24:29.240 --> 24:34.600]  indirectly through Michael Hastings and others before Michael Hastings died and
[24:34.600 --> 24:38.640]  he's set up this interview it's going to be a very interesting interview because
[24:38.640 --> 24:44.360]  now the gag is off of Barrett Brown he can talk about how as a journalist he
[24:44.360 --> 24:49.640]  was railroaded and we need to understand as I mentioned last time we no longer
[24:49.640 --> 24:53.600]  have a rule of law and we're going to see that in some of the things that
[24:53.600 --> 24:57.520]  happened in his trial and the charges that were brought against him we no
[24:57.520 --> 25:02.680]  longer have the rule of law as he said we have the rule of law enforcement we
[25:02.680 --> 25:06.360]  have a government that has broken the chains that bound them down the
[25:06.360 --> 25:10.880]  Constitution and I think we need to understand the dire situation the dire
[25:10.880 --> 25:14.960]  threat that we all are facing in terms of freedom of speech they're coming at
[25:14.960 --> 25:19.600]  it from every angle trying to treat journalists as criminals simultaneously
[25:19.600 --> 25:23.640]  shutting down the Internet simultaneously exerting control over the
[25:23.640 --> 25:28.320]  Internet with both the FCC and now the FTC the Federal Trade Commission is now
[25:28.320 --> 25:32.040]  trying to get in on the regulation of the Internet because that's going to be a
[25:32.040 --> 25:36.320]  major growth industry for government bureaucrats they can really grow their
[25:36.320 --> 25:40.960]  little empires by somehow finding something on the Internet to regulate
[25:40.960 --> 25:45.520]  but of course they're going to do it at the expense of our freedoms our
[25:45.520 --> 25:49.040]  liberties and so we're going to talk to Anthony Gucciardi and the third hour
[25:49.040 --> 25:52.000]  about that Paul Joseph Watson is also going to be joining us in the third hour
[25:52.000 --> 25:59.320]  to talk about his recent reports on feminism and racism before we go to
[25:59.320 --> 26:04.080]  that I wanted to continue with this report about the EPA coming after
[26:04.080 --> 26:08.320]  Woodstove rules because that's not new as I point out Rob do did a report about
[26:08.320 --> 26:13.200]  that I've reported on their efforts to try to build their empire by regulating
[26:13.200 --> 26:16.000]  what they call fine particulate matter how they've lied to people about it have
[26:16.000 --> 26:20.560]  they've done human experimentation that either they're lying about the dangerous
[26:20.560 --> 26:25.760]  levels of fine particulate matter or they are guilty of experimenting on
[26:25.760 --> 26:30.320]  humans in a way that violates the Nuremberg code and they should go to
[26:30.320 --> 26:35.200]  jail if what they're telling us about fine particulate matter is true if it is
[26:35.200 --> 26:40.600]  as harmful as they have said it is then they've exposed people to 70 times the
[26:40.600 --> 26:45.280]  level that they said would kill someone they should go to jail you cannot even
[26:45.280 --> 26:48.440]  get people's informed consent for that kind of experimentation and they did
[26:48.440 --> 26:53.480]  not give them a full explanation completely inform them of what was going
[26:53.480 --> 26:59.400]  on or the risks according to the EPA but I think is very important because this
[26:59.400 --> 27:04.000]  is part of a broader movement that we see people waking up to the abuses of
[27:04.000 --> 27:09.040]  these federal bureaucracies people who are waking up to the idea that they
[27:09.040 --> 27:15.440]  banned pot that we can't smoke pot that we can't have pot for medicine now
[27:15.440 --> 27:19.800]  they're going after our pot belly stoves saying you can't even light up a piece of
[27:19.800 --> 27:24.360]  wood this is the type of total control that we're going into and of course the
[27:24.360 --> 27:28.560]  way they're trying to exercise this control unconstitutionally is by an
[27:28.560 --> 27:34.360]  expansive reading of the Commerce Clause saying that they get to regulate
[27:34.360 --> 27:39.120]  these types of things that's usually the basis for it understand and I just had
[27:39.120 --> 27:44.120]  it there's a today we have a meeting that's going on a United Nations meeting
[27:44.120 --> 27:49.200]  about drug prohibition I interviewed a former Cook County prosecutor that's in
[27:49.200 --> 27:55.160]  Chicago Jim Guiroch with law enforcement against prohibition a week ago he was
[27:55.160 --> 27:58.640]  going to be going to this and trying to change the direction that the UN is
[27:58.640 --> 28:04.240]  going change it from a law enforcement approach to treating it as a medical
[28:04.240 --> 28:10.240]  issue as a spiritual issue if you will okay it should be treated as a dependency
[28:10.240 --> 28:13.440]  issue not as law enforcement that hasn't worked for 40 years it didn't work with
[28:13.440 --> 28:17.840]  alcohol prohibition but more importantly I had an epiphany when I
[28:17.840 --> 28:21.480]  interviewed Jim Guiroch as I was preparing for this I realized for the
[28:21.480 --> 28:27.960]  first time the real chronology of the war on drugs and how it began with the
[28:27.960 --> 28:32.520]  United Nations how they came up with an agenda ten years before we had the
[28:32.520 --> 28:37.320]  declaration of a war on drugs by Richard Nixon nine years after they had
[28:37.320 --> 28:41.440]  created the agenda complete with schedule one schedule two schedule three
[28:41.440 --> 28:45.560]  schedule four drugs they they worked it out to that detail just like they do with
[28:45.560 --> 28:50.480]  UN agenda 21 the UN works out these agendas they create the legislation they
[28:50.480 --> 28:54.440]  model it and then they leave it to the sovereign states to enforce because UN
[28:54.440 --> 28:58.840]  doesn't currently have any way that they can enforce their laws so they set out
[28:58.840 --> 29:02.960]  an agenda and they make everybody think though oh this this is something that
[29:02.960 --> 29:08.200]  people figured out in America or they figured out the sustainability approach
[29:08.200 --> 29:14.160]  here in my local community it's a scripted agenda that's been fed to them
[29:14.160 --> 29:18.800]  and so that's what they did to us with the war on drugs with drug prohibition
[29:18.800 --> 29:22.760]  that came out from the UN and of course we started to get ideas about this as
[29:22.760 --> 29:27.360]  they were pushing back against the legalization of recreational use in
[29:27.360 --> 29:31.960]  Colorado and Washington now in Alaska the UN is furious about that because it's
[29:31.960 --> 29:36.120]  a UN agenda that's being pushed on us yet another reason why we should push
[29:36.120 --> 29:40.480]  that back we need to understand that it took a constitutional amendment to
[29:40.480 --> 29:44.720]  prohibit alcohol because they don't have the authority to prevent it even under
[29:44.720 --> 29:48.960]  the Commerce Clause that would only be interstate commerce not within the states
[29:48.960 --> 29:55.440]  they were on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio

[32:06.720 --> 32:11.120]  nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits so many
[32:11.120 --> 32:14.960]  other formulations out there contain toxic ingredients synthetic additives
[32:14.960 --> 32:19.760]  and even GMOs introducing the all-new ancient defense herbal immunity blend
[32:19.760 --> 32:25.440]  crafted with over 14 key ancient herbs and extracts to supercharge and prepare

[33:16.680 --> 33:22.960]  tyranny over the mind of man Thomas Jefferson
[33:22.960 --> 33:30.920]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your host today and the
[33:30.920 --> 33:35.840]  next hour we're going to be talking with Barrett Brown from prison we have Joe
[33:35.840 --> 33:39.560]  Biggs is going to be in here with me and we're going to take a call from Barrett
[33:39.560 --> 33:44.080]  Brown he is now free after being gagged about talking about the charges against
[33:44.080 --> 33:48.120]  him about the conduct of the court he's now going to be free to talk about that
[33:48.120 --> 33:53.240]  I'm anxious to hear what he has to say of course we've seen one article at least
[33:53.240 --> 33:56.360]  from him talking about it and as he pointed out I've mentioned already a
[33:56.360 --> 34:00.360]  couple of times in the show we no longer is this is what he said to the judge he
[34:00.360 --> 34:05.280]  said we no longer have the rule of law we have the rule of law enforcement we
[34:05.280 --> 34:11.760]  should understand what happened in his trial because they are changing the rules
[34:11.760 --> 34:16.680]  they're changing it to do whatever they want to they're taking away all of our
[34:16.680 --> 34:21.000]  legal rights they're not just spying on us but they take away our rights in court
[34:21.000 --> 34:25.800]  and so we're going to talk to him about that about the essentially the kangaroo
[34:25.800 --> 34:32.280]  trial that they had for him we were just talking in the last segment about new
[34:32.280 --> 34:36.560]  rules from the EPA that would shut down wood stove so this is the way one person
[34:36.560 --> 34:41.320]  in Missouri said put this he said people have been burning wood since the
[34:41.320 --> 34:45.280]  beginning of recorded time they're trying to regulate it now out of existence I
[34:45.280 --> 34:50.640]  believe and they really have no concern about the economic consequences or the
[34:50.640 --> 34:56.480]  hardship that it's going to cause they really have no concern they just want
[34:56.480 --> 35:01.000]  to extend their empire the way they're getting these regulations for fine
[35:01.000 --> 35:06.520]  particulate matter is that they are lying to people about the effects of
[35:06.520 --> 35:10.480]  these experiments that they're doing when they hook them up to diesel tailpipes
[35:10.480 --> 35:15.000]  they're telling them that you might be sick for a little while not telling them
[35:15.000 --> 35:20.680]  what the head of the EPA told Congress that you're not talking about getting
[35:20.680 --> 35:24.520]  sick we're talking about people dying so they're not telling them that they're
[35:24.520 --> 35:29.800]  exposing them to high levels of it they were not able to stop that from
[35:29.800 --> 35:32.840]  happening in North Carolina they then went out and did it in California now
[35:32.840 --> 35:35.200]  they're back in North Carolina you know who they're looking for they're looking
[35:35.200 --> 35:40.680]  for black teenagers with asthma so they're hooking up black teenagers with
[35:40.680 --> 35:46.560]  asthma to diesel tailpipes trying to make them sick so they can justify taking
[35:46.560 --> 35:51.760]  away your wood burning stove that's how out of control our feral government is
[35:51.760 --> 35:56.840]  it is now a feral government it's not even federal it's feral it's gone wild
[35:56.840 --> 36:01.400]  it is no longer it's a pack of dogs who are out to hunt you down to take your
[36:01.400 --> 36:06.160]  property to take your freedom to take your rights to put you in jail like they
[36:06.160 --> 36:10.120]  did Barrett Brown's we're gonna talk to him in the second hour going to talk to
[36:10.120 --> 36:14.360]  Anthony Gucci already in the third hour about how yet another government agency
[36:14.360 --> 36:19.280]  the FTC the Federal Trade Commission is now trying to hop on the internet band
[36:19.280 --> 36:23.000]  wagon to regulate that one of the ways that we push this back there was an
[36:23.000 --> 36:28.840]  interesting story last week about midweek about a sled in that was held
[36:28.840 --> 36:33.000]  on Capitol Hill what is a sled in well they point out in the article they say
[36:33.000 --> 36:36.720]  those who don't live in Washington DC may not know it but America's most famous
[36:36.720 --> 36:41.880]  hill Capitol Hill is also fantastic for sledding however it's been prohibited by
[36:41.880 --> 36:46.800]  a rule occasionally enforced by the US Capitol police so some people were
[36:46.800 --> 36:52.360]  getting hassled by the police for doing it so what did they do they organized a
[36:52.360 --> 36:58.480]  massive sled and in defiance of these ridiculous rules that's the way we do
[36:58.480 --> 37:03.800]  this I've seen this before in my own personal life back in the late 80s close
[37:03.800 --> 37:08.400]  to one of the stores that we owned there was just the next street over was a
[37:08.400 --> 37:12.320]  very steep hill we had a snowstorm it's a rare occasion when that happens in the
[37:12.320 --> 37:16.480]  middle of North Carolina and so everything was shut down the families
[37:16.480 --> 37:21.520]  right as a small cul-de-sac with a sharp hill on it and the families were
[37:21.520 --> 37:25.160]  there with their kids they were going down the hill enjoying it having a good
[37:25.160 --> 37:31.720]  time the local police showed up the Kerry police and they told everybody they'd
[37:31.720 --> 37:35.240]  have to stop or they were going to arrest them you know what the people did
[37:35.240 --> 37:39.240]  they picked up snowballs and started throwing them at the cops and the cops
[37:39.240 --> 37:42.560]  had to leave it was on the paper the next day and the Kerry news it was it was a
[37:42.560 --> 37:47.880]  great example of people saying just get out of here you don't have any authority
[37:47.880 --> 37:51.220]  here you're overstepping this you're out of line just go away and that's what
[37:51.220 --> 37:57.440]  people did I'm glad to see 20 years later 30 years later this is now happening
[37:57.440 --> 38:02.000]  in Washington DC and you know it's not just about snow sledding that they're
[38:02.000 --> 38:06.240]  said we've had enough of your laws we've had enough of your control they're
[38:06.240 --> 38:12.200]  doing it in Washington DC over pot it's one of the areas where they passed a
[38:12.200 --> 38:17.880]  decriminalization of recreational pot is in Washington DC and of course the
[38:17.880 --> 38:22.240]  Republicans especially because they're the ones who are pushing this the worst
[38:22.240 --> 38:25.640]  the Republicans came back and said no we're gonna cut the funding if you don't
[38:25.640 --> 38:33.480]  if you stop arresting people for pot this is absolute nonsense and as Rand Paul
[38:33.480 --> 38:39.320]  pointed out the fact that Republicans like Jeb Bush would still want to put
[38:39.320 --> 38:43.120]  people in jail who are using pot not even for recreational purposes that
[38:43.120 --> 38:46.840]  wasn't even the issue in Florida and even though that constitutional amendment
[38:46.840 --> 38:52.080]  didn't pass in Florida because it didn't get 60% it got 58% of the vote the
[38:52.080 --> 38:56.840]  vast majority of people do not want to lock people up for doing something
[38:56.840 --> 39:03.400]  nonviolent that is really substantially no different from drinking a lot less
[39:03.400 --> 39:08.200]  dangerous quite frankly than drinking but there's also in Florida the element
[39:08.200 --> 39:12.440]  was people need this for medical purposes we've got a representative David
[39:12.440 --> 39:17.840]  Simpson a great guy here in Texas twice he's introduced an amendment to stop the
[39:17.840 --> 39:22.160]  TSA from sexually molesting children especially but all of us none of us
[39:22.160 --> 39:26.960]  should be allowed we shouldn't allow the TSA to sexually molest us David
[39:26.960 --> 39:30.960]  Simpson put it in to stop them a few years ago you may remember it passed
[39:30.960 --> 39:34.400]  unanimously in the house as it was getting ready to go to the Senate the
[39:34.400 --> 39:39.320]  TSA threatened to turn Texas into a no fly zone they then got in touch with the
[39:39.320 --> 39:44.040]  Lieutenant Governor David Dewhurst who went straight straight from a career
[39:44.040 --> 39:51.600]  with the CIA became Lieutenant Governor with spending more money than anybody
[39:51.600 --> 39:55.800]  has ever seen for that race before well they got the CIA agent in along with
[39:55.800 --> 40:00.280]  their threatening to turn Texas into a no fly zone and they stopped it at the
[40:00.280 --> 40:05.720]  Senate he reintroduced it in the next legislative session two years later now
[40:05.720 --> 40:11.760]  he's back with a law that says we're not going to lock people up who are using
[40:11.760 --> 40:16.280]  marijuana for medical purposes it can be used for a lot of different things it
[40:16.280 --> 40:19.680]  can it's one of the most effective medications for people suffering from
[40:19.680 --> 40:24.080]  MS or from glaucoma it helps people who are suffering from nausea because they're
[40:24.080 --> 40:27.600]  going through uncontrollable nausea because they're going through chemotherapy
[40:27.600 --> 40:32.200]  for cancer for AIDS why are we locking people up like this
[40:32.200 --> 40:39.440]  Rand Paul said the same thing why would Jeb Bush lobby so hard to try to lock
[40:39.440 --> 40:44.120]  people up in Florida who use marijuana for medical purposes when he admits that
[40:44.120 --> 40:50.520]  he did it for recreational purposes as a young brat in a prep school of course
[40:50.520 --> 40:54.680]  he gets away with it because the rich and the powerful are never subject to
[40:54.680 --> 41:00.920]  these laws one of the things that really concerned me this last week when I saw
[41:00.920 --> 41:07.320]  this and I saw this it was about a week ago that the story was updated on USA
[41:07.320 --> 41:13.120]  Today this is a story that's been going on since last November and that is about
[41:13.120 --> 41:19.440]  this bio weapon that escaped in Tulane got out of the level 3 safety lab the
[41:19.440 --> 41:23.560]  biosafety lab level 3 there's only four levels so it's the next of the highest
[41:23.560 --> 41:29.240]  level very tightly controlled in Tulane they're doing experiments on a rare
[41:29.240 --> 41:37.000]  bacteria Burkholderia Pseudo molyi and it is something that is not endemic to
[41:37.000 --> 41:41.320]  the United States but it is part of the experiments that are going on throughout
[41:41.320 --> 41:47.920]  our country with the assistance of the CDC that are called gain of function gain
[41:47.920 --> 41:52.480]  of function what do they mean by that well by that they mean that they're
[41:52.480 --> 41:58.360]  going to modify the bacteria so that it is resistant antibiotics so that it is
[41:58.360 --> 42:04.560]  more transmissible so that it is more dangerous more deadly that's the gain of
[42:04.560 --> 42:08.600]  function making it more deadly weaponizing it if you will okay you
[42:08.600 --> 42:11.920]  understand that's what's happening with this and of course we've had a lot of
[42:11.920 --> 42:17.720]  reports that you know there's good documentation that Lyme disease came
[42:17.720 --> 42:22.360]  out of the Plum Island facility there's a lot of people who have asked
[42:22.360 --> 42:27.400]  questions as to why Tulane was experimenting in Sierra Leone with
[42:27.400 --> 42:31.360]  Ebola just prior to the massive outbreak that is still not under control in that
[42:31.360 --> 42:35.200]  country it's the one country they haven't got it under control with and of
[42:35.200 --> 42:40.480]  course it was John Rappapour who reported that in August of last year saying
[42:40.480 --> 42:44.800]  that they were essentially thrown out by the Sierra Leone people and it was
[42:44.800 --> 42:48.840]  Tulane University the same people that have now had this leak I want to put a
[42:48.840 --> 42:52.880]  little bit of perspective into this a timeline it was back in October if you
[42:52.880 --> 42:56.720]  remember that there was a lot of concern in Congress they were having hearings
[42:56.720 --> 43:01.640]  they said there's been a lot of mishandling of very dangerous organisms
[43:01.640 --> 43:05.480]  that have been brought in for this gain of function to be weaponized if you will
[43:05.480 --> 43:10.440]  these are things that the CDC calls select agents select agents have the
[43:10.440 --> 43:13.120]  potential to be weaponized and so they bring them in to make weapons out of
[43:13.120 --> 43:17.480]  them that's what the CDC is involved in they're not there to make you safe okay
[43:17.480 --> 43:21.080]  let's understand that right away Congress held hearings the Obama
[43:21.080 --> 43:24.400]  administration put a moratorium on it so here you got Congress and Obama saying
[43:24.400 --> 43:29.000]  let's put a moratorium on this that's the way it was reported in much of the
[43:29.000 --> 43:33.400]  press actually that's not what really happened they said we want to put a
[43:33.400 --> 43:39.440]  moratorium on any new funding but we would like to have voluntary cessation
[43:39.440 --> 43:44.360]  a voluntary halt for the people who are already involved in these I think mad
[43:44.360 --> 43:49.760]  science experiments that didn't happen in Tulane they continued to experiment
[43:49.760 --> 43:54.560]  and then in November they had two monkeys that were infected with this bacteria
[43:54.560 --> 44:01.680]  that has a 50% mortality rate in in Thailand where it's endemic they found
[44:01.680 --> 44:07.280]  two monkeys that were outside of the biosafety lab how did that happen that
[44:07.280 --> 44:11.880]  should never have happened they were outdoors in cages one of those monkeys
[44:11.880 --> 44:16.120]  got both of them pretty sick one of them got better the other one they put
[44:16.120 --> 44:20.440]  down a few months later the second monkey died in the meantime they had found
[44:20.440 --> 44:25.520]  two other monkeys that have been infected also outside at that point in
[44:25.520 --> 44:29.240]  January they bring in some inspectors from the US Department of Agriculture
[44:29.240 --> 44:35.280]  one of those inspectors comes down with the same bacteria the next day now
[44:35.280 --> 44:40.280]  they come back and they say well it took them a very long time to say this but
[44:40.280 --> 44:44.200]  now the CDC is saying at first they said well you know she's been a lot of
[44:44.200 --> 44:50.160]  places where she studies this bacteria so she probably had this before because
[44:50.160 --> 44:53.920]  it can take anywhere from one day to several years before you exhibit
[44:53.920 --> 44:59.640]  symptoms which makes it very very dangerous it's like typhoid Mary she
[44:59.640 --> 45:06.560]  was able to spread typhoid because she was not symptomatic and so when you
[45:06.560 --> 45:10.520]  have something like this bacteria and it transmits by getting into the soil and
[45:10.520 --> 45:16.840]  into the water when it is not generating symptoms for a very long time it can
[45:16.840 --> 45:21.520]  continue to spread that's what makes it very difficult to control nevertheless
[45:21.520 --> 45:26.680]  what they said was we don't think that she got sick here she probably had picked
[45:26.680 --> 45:30.880]  this up previously now when they looked at the monkeys they were able to look at
[45:30.880 --> 45:34.760]  the particular strain and say yes this is the particular strain of this
[45:34.760 --> 45:41.960]  bacteria it came from a Thai rice farmer but they didn't do that with her why to
[45:41.960 --> 45:45.880]  me that's the dog that doesn't bark they didn't come in and say well we've run
[45:45.880 --> 45:50.240]  this test and it is definitely not the same strain nevertheless even after
[45:50.240 --> 45:55.760]  this happened even after it was such an incredible breach that they have these
[45:55.760 --> 46:00.680]  monkeys outside of the Biolab come down with this they still put another 170
[46:00.680 --> 46:06.440]  monkeys outside this is something that's also been reported from USDA and then
[46:06.440 --> 46:09.760]  they started to look to see if it had spread looking in the soil because
[46:09.760 --> 46:13.520]  that's where the bacteria likes to hang out in the soil and one of the cages
[46:13.520 --> 46:18.080]  half the size of a football field they did four samples they should have done
[46:18.080 --> 46:23.280]  according to research that the USA Today reporter Allison Young pointed out she
[46:23.280 --> 46:27.640]  pulled up a study which none of the science magazines pointed out no one
[46:27.640 --> 46:31.440]  else pointed this out but the one researcher who has been following these
[46:31.440 --> 46:38.080]  kinds of mishandling of deadly organisms by the CDC by these laboratories
[46:38.080 --> 46:43.160]  she's really been on this from day one she did the research she found a study
[46:43.160 --> 46:46.400]  in India that says there's no way that you're going to be able to find it from
[46:46.400 --> 46:49.840]  four samples in an area half the size of a football field you're going to need to
[46:49.840 --> 46:54.440]  have at least a hundred samples but that's it that's what they did just a
[46:54.440 --> 46:59.480]  few of those and now we find this last week there's been a fifth monkey that's
[46:59.480 --> 47:04.600]  come down and as soon as that story came out on Friday we learned that there
[47:04.600 --> 47:09.400]  were another two monkeys so we've gone from five monkeys now to seven monkeys
[47:09.400 --> 47:12.680]  in a very short period of time it looks like we're getting pretty close to the
[47:12.680 --> 47:19.280]  12 monkey scenario but the real question is why are we allowing them to do this
[47:19.280 --> 47:25.500]  kind of experimentation it is absolutely absolutely insane to allow the
[47:25.500 --> 47:29.840]  government to do this kind of experimentation to create weaponized
[47:29.840 --> 47:34.760]  forms of bacteria that if they accidentally get out of the lab or if
[47:34.760 --> 47:38.200]  they're deliberately taken out of the lab what was the name of that guy here at
[47:38.200 --> 47:42.320]  the University of Texas that Alex has talked about so many times working in
[47:42.320 --> 47:47.120]  the biology department saying if only we could reduce the human population by
[47:47.120 --> 47:54.040]  99.9% what's this professor Eric Pianca Eric Pianca Eric Pianca it was reported
[47:54.040 --> 48:00.400]  by some doctors who were absolutely horrified at that meeting they reported
[48:00.400 --> 48:04.160]  that unfortunately nobody had a recording of it but they also reported
[48:04.160 --> 48:08.680]  that most of the people there applauded the fact that what we really needed was
[48:08.680 --> 48:14.840]  a weaponized Ebola maybe that's what these people have given us maybe that's
[48:14.840 --> 48:20.480]  really what they're working on very very disturbing research and of course
[48:20.480 --> 48:27.440]  having a moratorium on new research like this and just saying that we're going
[48:27.440 --> 48:32.240]  to voluntarily take it down absolutely does nothing to stop this and it's not
[48:32.240 --> 48:35.960]  just Tulane when I started researching this of course University of Texas at
[48:35.960 --> 48:41.960]  Galveston as well as Austin is also involved in creating oh this is this is
[48:41.960 --> 48:46.180]  the important part it's all about creating a vaccine they want to create a
[48:46.180 --> 48:50.320]  vaccine so then I guess that once this gets outside the lab then they can force
[48:50.320 --> 48:56.400]  us to take that vaccine see it's not the the people who don't want to get their
[48:56.400 --> 49:00.080]  kids vaccinated or who want to follow a different vaccination schedule who want
[49:00.080 --> 49:05.520]  to spread it out instead of giving all the vaccines at once see they're not the
[49:05.520 --> 49:11.000]  problem we don't need to lose our informed consent we don't need to go
[49:11.000 --> 49:15.440]  into some kind of a medical tyranny the problem is the people who are going in
[49:15.440 --> 49:19.720]  and genetically modifying and that's what they're doing with this
[49:19.720 --> 49:25.280]  Burkholderia Pseudo-Malai they're immunizing people with recombinant
[49:25.280 --> 49:30.720]  forms of that they're genetically modifying this they don't know what
[49:30.720 --> 49:34.440]  they're doing these are people who as Allison Young pointed out as they were
[49:34.440 --> 49:37.520]  in September when they were talking about all the security breaches there
[49:37.520 --> 49:40.720]  she said you've got people in spacesuits and they're running around a lab
[49:40.720 --> 49:43.960]  what are they looking for they're looking for a little mouse it's on the loose
[49:43.960 --> 49:49.160]  that's been exposed to I think it was Ebola's Ebola or anthrax I this would
[49:49.160 --> 49:55.360]  be funny if it wasn't so serious and yet these people who are deliberately
[49:55.360 --> 49:59.560]  weaponizing stuff who can't keep track of the little mouse who gets in or the
[49:59.560 --> 50:04.660]  you've got another deadly weaponized bacteria that jumps between one
[50:04.660 --> 50:08.120]  fair to the other by going through the air that's one of the things that got
[50:08.120 --> 50:12.520]  people very concerned about this wanting to regulate this they don't know
[50:12.520 --> 50:18.360]  how Ebola is transmitted exactly because they can't control it if they knew
[50:18.360 --> 50:23.960]  exactly how it was transmitted I don't think it would still be on the loose in
[50:23.960 --> 50:28.840]  Sierra Leone this is an interesting article and I just when I looked at
[50:28.840 --> 50:36.320]  this headline where's the pathogen this was from microbe it's a
[50:36.320 --> 50:42.440]  microbiology publication and it's basically like where's Waldo it's like
[50:42.440 --> 50:48.200]  can you find within 500 acres and 50 samples can you find the bacteria and
[50:48.200 --> 50:52.240]  they said we think that maybe this hasn't gotten out yet but the callousness
[50:52.240 --> 50:55.800]  which is during the Cavalier attitude that they're showing to this is really
[50:55.800 --> 50:59.440]  concerning stay with us we'll be right back

[55:08.560 --> 55:13.320]  some techno tech news I want to cover here besides I'm thinking of function
[55:13.320 --> 55:18.240]  biology news that we just had in the last segment this is some electronic
[55:18.240 --> 55:21.800]  tech news before I go back to that though just want to let you know that
[55:21.800 --> 55:25.280]  we've got super female vitality right now looks like it's going to sell out we
[55:25.280 --> 55:30.680]  had super male completely sold out after our 30 percent sale we right now for the
[55:30.680 --> 55:36.440]  next five minutes only we have 30 percent off at the info wars store com on
[55:36.440 --> 55:40.960]  super female that's right just for five minutes we've got 30 percent off we're
[55:40.960 --> 55:43.800]  going to take that down after those five minutes and it could be about eight to
[55:43.800 --> 55:47.640]  12 weeks before we get another shipment of super female so super male is
[55:47.640 --> 55:53.440]  completely sold out we still have super female and of course there's nothing in
[55:53.440 --> 55:57.400]  there that you can't take if you're a male and a lot of the nutrients that are
[55:57.400 --> 56:00.640]  in there are the same for either super male or super female again that's 30
[56:00.640 --> 56:05.320]  percent off right now at the info wars store com just for the next five minutes
[56:05.320 --> 56:09.560]  super male is sold out and super female will probably sell out today and the
[56:09.560 --> 56:15.200]  special be over in just five minutes now there was some amazing news on the
[56:15.200 --> 56:19.240]  drudge report I saw a story linked to the Daily Mail about how the British
[56:19.240 --> 56:24.560]  government wants to get everybody to put a CCTV camera in every home a closed
[56:24.560 --> 56:29.080]  circuit television camera in every home what's the justification for that well
[56:29.080 --> 56:35.720]  Scotland Yard says that will help them to track burglars how do we arrest the
[56:35.720 --> 56:40.760]  burglars from the government who are breaking into our homes and stealing our
[56:40.760 --> 56:46.880]  privacy and our rights how do we stop those burglars those are the ones that
[56:46.880 --> 56:50.520]  are far more dangerous than the ones that take your television set your
[56:50.520 --> 56:55.160]  television cassette can easily be replaced your rights and your freedoms
[56:55.160 --> 57:00.640]  cannot how do we stop the government burglars who are coming into our homes
[57:00.640 --> 57:05.080]  they said no Britain needs more cameras in order to help fight crime and he
[57:05.080 --> 57:10.640]  called on this is the head of Scotland Yard sir Bernard Hogan howl said that
[57:10.640 --> 57:16.120]  families and businesses need to install cameras at eye level so they can exploit
[57:16.120 --> 57:22.520]  advances and facial recognition technology there you go and a guy from
[57:22.520 --> 57:27.480]  an organization called big brother watch said private closed circuit television
[57:27.480 --> 57:33.680]  is completely unregulated recommending greater use of CCTV together more
[57:33.680 --> 57:39.160]  images of people's faces often innocent people's faces undermines the security
[57:39.160 --> 57:45.120]  of each and every one of us and of course the way they do this in America to
[57:45.120 --> 57:51.720]  get around search warrants is they go to the web country the company that you
[57:51.720 --> 57:55.620]  deal with or your ISP provider or your cell phone provider and they say well
[57:55.620 --> 58:01.320]  you know these people are giving you their data voluntarily so that's your
[58:01.320 --> 58:04.520]  data doesn't you know all this information about this person's private
[58:04.520 --> 58:09.720]  emails and who they called when and what they talked about that's not their
[58:09.720 --> 58:14.840]  data that's now your data so you can turn that over to us that's what they're
[58:14.840 --> 58:18.360]  doing by putting it in people's homes and when they talk about big brother
[58:18.360 --> 58:22.600]  watch that's the name of the organization but guess what Apple is an
[58:22.600 --> 58:27.000]  unveiling today a big brother watch that's what the watch is going to do
[58:27.000 --> 58:32.480]  it's going to watch you and report to the government if it does what Apple's

[01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:12.960]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:20.480]  he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas
[01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:29.320]  alex jones welcome back to the alex jones show on david night i'm gonna be joined
[01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:33.160]  in the next segment with joe biggs and joe is gonna and i are going to talk
[01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:37.960]  about barrett brown's case give you a little bit of a background to it if you
[01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:41.480]  are not familiar with it because when we get barrett brown to join us at the
[01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:46.200]  bottom of the hour from prison we want to give him the opportunity to talk as
[01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:50.600]  much as he wants about what has happened to him about the implications of that
[01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:56.040]  for everybody not just for journalists but for everyone we all have a right to
[01:00:56.040 --> 01:01:02.320]  speak freely i noticed in looking at the court transcripts that they denigrated
[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:09.160]  glenn greenwald as saying he was a blogger for the guardian you know that's
[01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:14.640]  that's just part of the game that they play but that shouldn't denigrate him
[01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:20.560]  in anyone's eyes a blogger is just as important as a high-profile journalist
[01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:27.240]  like glenn greenwald we all have freedom of speech there's never a situation
[01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:31.440]  where we should have to get permission from the government to open up our own
[01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:36.160]  printing press and that's essentially what being a blogger is that's opening
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:39.240]  up your own printing press speaking your mind speaking freely using your
[01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:43.680]  freedom of speech everyone has a right to do that not just journalists but they
[01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:48.400]  played that game in court saying that barrett brown was not a journalist that
[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:51.880]  glenn greenwald was not a journalist we're gonna give you some background on
[01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:56.200]  that as far as we know and then we're going to be joined by barrett brown at
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:02:00.600]  the bottom of the hour going back to technology news of course today is they
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:04.360]  and it's going to be coming out right about now if they haven't already done
[01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:07.280]  it apple is unveiling its new apple watch and of course one of the things
[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:11.560]  that they're going to do with that is going to allow you to pay for everything
[01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:16.680]  you can just walk around with this watch and all these ads are to be like
[01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:20.320]  minority report where you walk past ads and it'll know who you are and it'll
[01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:24.120]  know your preferences because they know everything about you or they can pay for
[01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:28.080]  your transaction without having to take out your wallet just you know run this
[01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:33.640]  thing by it I will not be participating in that as I point out last time in the
[01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:38.200]  last segment Britain is now calling on everyone to add close-circuit
[01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:42.400]  televisions to their homes at eye level and then feed that back to Scotland
[01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:47.640]  Yards so they can build their facial recognition database seriously would
[01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:53.240]  people seriously volunteer for that I guess they believe you would because one
[01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:56.120]  of the documents that came out of the Snowden leak we've talked about this
[01:02:56.120 --> 01:03:00.800]  before it wasn't covered that widely in America it was covered was broken by
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:06.080]  Der Spiegel in Germany it was a press conference in Germany where this is
[01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:11.320]  shown but they had several slides from Apple Computer and they and these were
[01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:18.280]  slides from the NSA and they showed the iconic 1984 commercial for the Mac and
[01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:22.440]  they said who would have thought in 1984 and they show a picture of that and then
[01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:27.360]  the next slide shows Steve Jobs holding an iPhone and then the caption says that
[01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:32.680]  this would become Big Brother and then the third slide shows a lot of people
[01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:37.360]  standing in line to get their iPhones and the caption says and that people
[01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:41.880]  would line up to buy it so the question is are people going to line up to buy
[01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:48.080]  the next bit of Big Brother Pip surveillance software pay for their own
[01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:51.560]  surveillance are they going to put close-circuit television cameras in their
[01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:55.440]  homes are they going to buy the watches that are going to be at eye level so they
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:04:01.320]  can feed facial recognition into the government are we gonna do that are we
[01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:06.080]  gonna say we've had enough it's looking worse all the time of course and if you
[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:08.960]  look at what's happening in Venezuela they're going to install finger
[01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:14.560]  scanners and supermarkets why because they don't have enough food to feed
[01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:18.060]  people so people are hoarding they're cleaning off the shelves whenever they
[01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:22.080]  get any food over a year ago Bloomberg was talking about how the people of
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:25.420]  Venezuela were suffering severe shortages of food and water having to
[01:04:25.420 --> 01:04:31.480]  go across the border to get those basic commodities that they needed yet they
[01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:37.680]  said don't worry Venezuela under the Marxist has been a great profit center
[01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:42.480]  for us we've gotten 700% return on our investment 700% return on investment and
[01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:46.080]  we know that the current leadership of Venezuela knows that their first
[01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:50.400]  priority is to their bondholders not to the people who are starving there but
[01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:55.600]  they will use these kinds of controls like Apple Watch to shut you down to keep

[01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:29.680]  to what's been going on in the Barrett Brown case in case you don't know and he
[01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:35.240]  was just recently sentenced and fined an exorbitant amount is now in prison
[01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:39.400]  we're going to have him join us at the bottom of the hour calling in from
[01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:43.480]  prison and we don't want to waste any of the small amount of time that he gets
[01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:47.760]  on the prison phone so we wanted to kind of do our introduction and our
[01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:52.200]  background here before we got to Barrett Brown and then we'll talk about what he
[01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:57.760]  has to say after he has to leave us but joining us now is Joe Biggs thank you Joe
[01:08:57.760 --> 01:09:02.560]  thank you for having me here David yeah Barrett was someone that I first heard
[01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:05.840]  about when I was speaking with Michael Hastings you know some years back and
[01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:12.560]  after Michael passed I started looking into you know what was going on and
[01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:15.640]  things that he'd been looking into as well and then kind of saw the connection
[01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:19.600]  between Bear Brown and Michael Hastings they were working a lot of things
[01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:23.600]  together I spoke with Barrett not too long ago on the phone while he was in
[01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:29.680]  prison and he was telling me that he believes in 99.9% that the FBI was for
[01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:35.600]  sure investigating Michael Michael Hastings because the fact that he was
[01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:40.360]  helping with Barrett Brown when he had that project PM going yeah kind of a
[01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:43.760]  crowdsourcing investigation of the criminal activities of the corporations
[01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:46.400]  that were involved with the government the kind of corporate government
[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:50.480]  alliance to do criminal surveillance on everybody and the dirty tricks that they
[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:55.800]  had come up with against targeting individuals that had been speaking out
[01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:59.440]  about this before the Snowden leaks they're the big threats that they saw
[01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:04.040]  were from people like Barrett Brown Glenn Greenwald and they specifically
[01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:11.800]  targeted them and we later saw the released slides of Palantir and H.B.
[01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:16.840]  Gary and others that were coming after saying let's identify who the key players are and
[01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:20.600]  let's essentially go after them assassinate their character put them in
[01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:25.840]  jail or assassinate them as the Fox News commentator called for Julian Assange
[01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:30.280]  to be assassinated and they go and use that against Bear Brown when he quotes
[01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:35.760]  that exact same yeah yeah yeah yeah that was an amazing when Julian Assange
[01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:39.400]  pointed that out he said everybody needs to understand that social media has all
[01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:43.960]  of your friends wearing a wire and the government is going to use that
[01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:47.280]  information that they pick up they're going to twist it take it out of context
[01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:51.480]  and make all kinds of and of course one of the things that I was surprised was
[01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:57.800]  when Barrett Brown was upset after they came in and we're looking for a laptop
[01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:04.040]  and he hit it at his mom's house and his mom as she pointed out was kind of
[01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:08.960]  torn between maternal instinct and you know doing what they wanted her to do
[01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:14.080]  and so they said oh you tried to assist him in hiding these laptops from us he
[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:18.920]  was very angry because they're going to add a charge against his mother to try
[01:11:18.920 --> 01:11:23.160]  to get leverage against him because they always add these extraneous charges a
[01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:29.720]  lot of them total BS yeah to go after his after his mom and so he was in a
[01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:33.800]  state of withdrawal he had had some issues with drugs and he puts up this
[01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:39.680]  video and said basically you've exposed my information to the Zeta Cartel
[01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:42.760]  trying to get them to come after me because he had investigated the Zeta
[01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:48.080]  Cartel along with Anonymous and you you've put this information out there
[01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:51.600]  for them you've you've come after my mom I'm going to put information out there
[01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:56.120]  about you and because of that they took that as a threat yeah that was a crime
[01:11:56.120 --> 01:12:02.160]  there's so many felonies serious felonies out there on the books that the
[01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:06.720]  normal person would not even think of as being a crime and that's what we really
[01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:10.680]  have to be concerned about is the proliferation of all of these different
[01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:16.480]  felonies a guy releasing balloons on a beach okay that's a felony now I mean
[01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:21.840]  we cannot live our lives without being in constant jeopardy of being set up and
[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:25.200]  sent to jail by this overreaching government and I think that's precisely
[01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:29.120]  what's happening but it was even worse as it went through the trial things got
[01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:32.640]  even worse for him yeah exactly you know I've been trying to get a hold of him
[01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:37.680]  for about a year now it's going through all kinds of different loops trying to
[01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:43.840]  contact his people and get it set up and I'm glad we're finally able to get this
[01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:46.480]  opportunity to speak to him because like I said I got to talk to him the other
[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:52.680]  day he's got a wealth of information all around smart guy great guy and it's just
[01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:56.360]  sucks that you know the implications it has on journalism that sharing a link
[01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:59.960]  and quoting somebody can get you thrown in prison absolutely and one of the
[01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:03.360]  reasons that we of course we could not get in touch with them was because the
[01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:09.800]  court had essentially put a gag order on him and on his lawyers very much
[01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:15.120]  afraid of what he would say yeah and so they put a complete gag order on it and
[01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:19.120]  one of the things that he said in the editorial that he wrote after his
[01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:24.480]  sentencing was the good thing about it is at least now he's free to talk and so
[01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:29.440]  that's why we tried to establish contact with him again and of course at the time
[01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:34.080]  that Michael Hastings died he was not only working with the crowd sourcing
[01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:39.640]  Project PM to investigate the stuff but he was also talking to Barrett Brown
[01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:48.160]  about his prosecution and investigating that as well yeah yeah one of the
[01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:52.160]  interesting things that when I look at the statement that Barrett Brown made to
[01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:55.280]  the judge and of course the quote that I've repeated several times already in
[01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:59.040]  the program I think we really need to hammer this home because Barrett Brown
[01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:03.200]  is a very good writer he's a very eloquent writer and he really distills
[01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:08.600]  this down when he said we no longer have the rule of law we have the rule of law
[01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:13.880]  enforcement I think that really distills what this comes down to and as he
[01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:17.480]  pointed out to the judge he says this case does not just affect me it doesn't
[01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:21.600]  it affects all of us this is what he said to the judge because he wanted to
[01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:27.400]  this is in the you know before the judge sentenced him and so you know he wanted
[01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:32.800]  to kind of make an explanation so the judge would not give him as long of a
[01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:37.200]  sentence but he wasn't backing down completely he said when we start fighting
[01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:41.040]  crime by any means necessary and he's talking about the crimes committed by
[01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:44.640]  H.B. Gary and Pellentier and the government he says when we start
[01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:47.880]  fighting crime by any means necessary we become guilty of the same hypocrisy as
[01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:52.080]  the law enforcement agencies throughout history that break the rules to get the
[01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:57.720]  villain and then become villains themselves and he says understand that I
[01:14:57.720 --> 01:15:01.600]  run the risk of sounding combative but I think your honor can walk and chew
[01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:06.080]  bubblegum at the same time I think your honor understands that one can regret the
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:10.560]  unjust things that one has done while also being concerned about the unjust
[01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:15.040]  things that have been done to him I think I'm really anxious to talk to him one
[01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:19.760]  of the things and of course you remember Joe we've talked to Amber Lyon
[01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:25.120]  because the research that she did in Bahrain she was investigating the brutal
[01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:30.320]  crackdown in that US government ally against the pro-democracy movement there
[01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:35.200]  she was working for CNN at the time put together a documentary and CNN basically
[01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:40.480]  spiked the story and she eventually wound up leaving CNN one of the things that
[01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:46.640]  Bert Brown points out is that they were coming after those laptops because they
[01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:50.000]  said well there's information there about how you're trying to overthrow the
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:54.680]  government of Bahrain with Amber Lyon. One of the most preposterous things I've ever
[01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:58.200]  seen. Yeah they're trying to get his contacts or trying to find out who he's
[01:15:58.200 --> 01:16:01.640]  in contact with and then go after those people I mean that's that's just
[01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:05.640]  completely bogus that yeah yeah as a journalist you should be able to have
[01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:09.560]  your contacts to keep them private. And he really understood where this was
[01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:13.960]  headed he goes and let me again read from his statement to the judge he's
[01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:16.760]  gonna be joining us at the bottom of the hour so we want to go through this and
[01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:20.360]  just let him talk because he's got a lot to say he said the government claims
[01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:24.760]  those laptops contained evidence of a plot that I orchestrated to attack the
[01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:29.080]  kingdom of Bahrain on orders of Amber Lyon. Your honor Amber Lyon is a
[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:33.000]  journalist a former CNN reporter who I know and respect but I can assure your
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:37.400]  honor I'm not in the habit of attacking Gulf state monarchies on her behalf but
[01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:41.360]  then he goes on to point out what you're really doing here is giving the
[01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:45.640]  kingdom of Bahrain an excuse to keep her from ever getting back into the
[01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:49.920]  country to ever do any more reports because now they can come back and say
[01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:54.880]  the Justice Department has said that she's trying to overthrow the government
[01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:59.800]  they can refer to this charge that was put on there by the FBI and use that as
[01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:04.040]  a way to keep her out of the country. So there's always an alternative motive
[01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:07.760]  isn't there? Yeah always and one of the interesting things too that we were
[01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:12.560]  talking about a he had a copy of a the Declaration of Independence yeah at his
[01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:16.680]  home and come in and file that. Absolutely yeah we're gonna put that up
[01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:23.520]  actually the Twitter of that he tweeted out what what they actually said and
[01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:27.880]  they go back and forth and say well I think we can give him his copy of the
[01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:33.200]  Constitution back he said he when he wrote this this op-ed piece for the
[01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:37.360]  Daily Beast after he was sentenced he said at the title of it was my post
[01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:42.160]  cyberpunk indentured servitude one of the things that he said was I can now
[01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:45.440]  talk about some of the things that people would not even believe and
[01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:49.320]  happen before he said for them to seize my copy of the Declaration of
[01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:54.480]  Independence as evidence of his criminal activity he says I blushed even put that
[01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:58.800]  in print because I don't think people would believe me so that's a problem we
[01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:03.560]  get all the time we get these documents we put them out there we even linked to
[01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:07.800]  the documents like he put the like he tweeted out the image of the court order
[01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:12.240]  saying I think you can give him his Declaration of Independence back Joe that
[01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:16.320]  was actually part of the plea bargain that he would give up his Declaration of
[01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:21.080]  Independence how appropriate that is that's out of this world you know we've
[01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:25.640]  been saying for the longest time that you know patriots people who love the
[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:29.840]  Constitution they are now the government's number one threat and I mean
[01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:34.000]  this right here is just another proof yes that entire thing I mean it's crazy
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:38.720]  that they're gonna go and file that is some kind of criminal well you know it
[01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:42.920]  just it's crazy this world we live in right now we look at the Mayak report
[01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:47.600]  from 2009 before that Alex's documentary is actually showing training
[01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:50.960]  sessions from the federal government training local law enforcement putting
[01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:55.760]  up pictures of the founders of this country saying these guys are terrorists
[01:18:55.760 --> 01:19:01.200]  anybody who quotes them are terrorists you know he looks at this now you know I
[01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:04.920]  don't know but Barrett Brown has been writing for the Daily Beast and for
[01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:08.800]  Huffington Post and The Guardian kind of left-wing publications that tend to
[01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:14.480]  discount the idea that the government is coming out there to to shut down any
[01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:19.040]  dissent they've been kind of poo-pooing that idea poo-pooing the idea that
[01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:26.520]  patriots are the focus and not foreign terrorists not Islamic terrorists they've
[01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:30.600]  kind of pushed back against that and so that's not true at all that's why they
[01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:34.280]  wouldn't believe that the FBI would take his Declaration of Independence that
[01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:36.680]  they would say we're going to keep that as part of your plea bargain
[01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:40.000]  agreement but we've been saying Alex Jones and Info Wars has been saying that
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.840]  for years and those are in people that we have those little pocket
[01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:46.040]  Constitution books you know I've spoken to people so they've been pulled over
[01:19:46.040 --> 01:19:50.320]  and the police call that contraband yeah yeah that shows that you're radical if

[01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:12.200]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight and joining me in the studio
[01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:17.240]  is Joe Biggs and we're going to be talking to Barrett Brown from prison in
[01:24:17.240 --> 01:24:20.480]  the next segment trying to give you a little bit of a background in case
[01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:24.560]  you're not familiar with the case or what has recently happened and of course
[01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:30.240]  when he wrote to his op-ed piece for the Daily Beast after he was sentenced
[01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:36.160]  entitled at my post cyberpunk and dirt indentured servitude he says that when
[01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:40.640]  he was sentenced to 63 months in federal prison reporters without borders
[01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:46.120]  cited his case as a key factor in reducing America's press freedom rankings
[01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:53.760]  from 33 to 46 very concerned about this because this directly impacts upon our
[01:24:53.760 --> 01:25:00.000]  freedom of the press but talk about his indentured servitude Joe I'm going to
[01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:04.960]  read a paragraph from the my post cyberpunk indentured servitude article
[01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:09.360]  says I also had to plead to an accessory after the fact charge for having
[01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:13.120]  contracted the corporate espionage outfit strapped for after some anonymous
[01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:16.920]  affiliated hackers sold several million of the firm's emails and vowed to
[01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:20.920]  publish them online I offered to arrange with the hackers to redact any of
[01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:24.320]  those communications that could potentially have endangered any foreign
[01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:28.440]  contacts if made public for this I will not only serve additional prison time
[01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:34.160]  but have also been ordered to pay the company over $800,000 absolutely
[01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:38.120]  outrageous and of course one of the reasons that they're coming came up with
[01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:41.040]  such a large figure I'm sure is because they figured well he could write a book
[01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:46.080]  he's someone who's written books successful books he's written for
[01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:49.440]  dozens of magazines and newspapers as he points out yet they wanted to
[01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:54.200]  continually assert that he wasn't a journalist in order to denigrate what he
[01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:57.920]  was doing to say that this wasn't a First Amendment issue they said how he's
[01:25:57.920 --> 01:26:03.320]  not a journalist look anybody that gathers any information has First
[01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:07.120]  Amendment protection and as a journalist even if Glenn Greenwald were
[01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:12.000]  merely a blogger that's not a merely anymore that's very important yeah some
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:16.720]  of the best stories have been turned up by bloggers so you don't have to be an
[01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:20.640]  official journalist that gets a paycheck each time a works for a big name
[01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:24.880]  mainstream media newspaper they're not the ones who are breaking the news in
[01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:29.040]  most cases anyway they're not the ones who want to follow the story wherever it
[01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:33.600]  leads or in the case of Amber Lyon as we saw whenever she works for CNN as a
[01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:38.360]  journalist they spike the story and she goes independent but I guess now she's
[01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:42.120]  not officially a journalist but that's a very dangerous thing is that as he
[01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:45.000]  points out he said that we one thing if the government was putting forth some
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:48.800]  sort of standard by which journalists could be defined well yeah that would be
[01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:54.600]  bad enough because we don't want them to put a box around free speech but
[01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:57.760]  they're not even doing that they're just saying well you know I don't think the
[01:26:57.760 --> 01:27:01.160]  First Amendment applies here doesn't apply there that's why he said we no
[01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:04.800]  longer have the rule of law we have the rule of law enforcement because they
[01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:09.760]  interpret it to mean whatever they want at any given time yeah US district judge
[01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:14.880]  Sam Lindsey says they didn't expect any they didn't express any visible interest
[01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:18.440]  in the fact that the FBI itself has acknowledged having actually overseen
[01:27:18.440 --> 01:27:24.560]  the hack on straffer yes confidential informant or rat Hector Sabu so that's
[01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:29.600]  right they actually the FBI actually took a guy they turned from anonymous
[01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:34.840]  Sabu and they used him to do the hack so the FBI does the hack he links to the
[01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:38.160]  information then they say well somewhere in that information there's some credit
[01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:41.680]  cards so we're going to charge you with credit card theft if you look at the
[01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:46.120]  transcripts they make it clear the judge is even talking about it well you know
[01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:49.960]  he linked to emails and we recorded his conversations because they record all
[01:27:49.960 --> 01:27:54.320]  the conversations of course while he's in custody and the judge says well he
[01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:56.680]  didn't know there was any he thought there was nothing in there but emails
[01:27:56.680 --> 01:28:00.800]  they knew that that was the case and he says here two days before his sentencing
[01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:06.200]  the Department of Justice withheld from his defense team sealed chat transcripts
[01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:11.080]  from Jeremy Hammond hacking case which contradicted its claim that he was a
[01:28:11.080 --> 01:28:16.520]  co-conspirator in the strat for case so they withheld that evidence so that's
[01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:20.680]  some of what we want to talk to Barrett Brown about but again this is a case
[01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:25.880]  that affects everybody whether or not you're a journalist you want journalists
[01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:29.360]  to be free you want people on the internet to have freedom of speech
[01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:33.240]  they're coming at us from every possible angle they're coming at us from a
[01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:38.440]  regulatory agency with the FCC with the FTC they're coming after the journalists
[01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:42.360]  putting them in jail they have just under what Obama proposed with the state
[01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:47.720]  of the Union was to step up the computer fraud and abuse act the CFAA which is
[01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:51.640]  what they came after Aaron Schwartz with they want to step that up from
[01:28:51.640 --> 01:28:55.840]  misdemeanor crimes to felony crimes and they want to extend it to RICO statutes
[01:28:55.840 --> 01:28:59.960]  and quite frankly they already did it in his case even though they didn't have
[01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:04.240]  the authority to do it in his case yeah ever since the Obama administration has
[01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:08.720]  been in power I mean there's definitely been a huge war on journalists in this
[01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:14.840]  country it's out of control yeah oh yeah there's been more people prosecuted
[01:29:14.840 --> 01:29:19.760]  under the 1917 espionage act I think it was like three times the number of
[01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:24.800]  people prosecuted under the 1917 act in the Obama administration then all of
[01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:29.360]  the previous administration since 1917 combined so he's done more than
[01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:32.840]  everybody else for virtually a hundred years stay with us right after the break
[01:29:32.840 --> 01:29:37.440]  Barrett Brown from prison we'll be right back

[01:33:52.120 --> 01:33:59.560]  and you can also look at his website echelon2.org Joe one of the things
[01:33:59.560 --> 01:34:03.600]  that got my attention of course you just got back from Chicago where there were
[01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:08.440]  allegations that people were being held there the Guardian reported this being
[01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:13.920]  held for periods of time without being arraigned people being tortured in this
[01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:19.000]  one particular site home and square he was held for two weeks without charge
[01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:25.400]  back in October 2012 and finally they indicted him and of course what he was
[01:34:25.400 --> 01:34:29.360]  indicted for was conspiring to release personal information about a government
[01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:33.120]  employee that seems to be the big crime that they came after him for as I said
[01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:38.280]  before there are so many felonies out there that the general public can't
[01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:42.600]  even keep up with all the laws that the government and the bureaucracies are
[01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:46.520]  enacting all the time very serious law serious felonies and that's what they
[01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:50.080]  got him on who would have thought that that would be a federal offense that he
[01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:54.760]  could be sent to jail for five over five years he's done three years in jail and
[01:34:54.760 --> 01:34:58.480]  is the 63 months is that in addition to what he's already done I think he's got
[01:34:58.480 --> 01:35:01.800]  the time served so when I when I talked to him on the phone the other day he was
[01:35:01.800 --> 01:35:05.120]  saying if he was willing to play ball with him that he could get out in
[01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:09.000]  about a year but he said man he said I'm not gonna do that he's like I'll sit
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:13.080]  here I'm gonna make them suffer and they're gonna have to watch me and you
[01:35:13.080 --> 01:35:15.440]  know if I'm gonna have to suffer they're gonna have to suffer as well so I
[01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:18.880]  kind of like that attitude that's yeah I'm kind of yeah attitude that he has
[01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:24.600]  again as I pointed out in the previous segment his conviction was cited by an
[01:35:24.600 --> 01:35:28.320]  organization reporters without borders cited as a key factor in reducing
[01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:34.680]  America's press freedom ranking from 33 to 46 latter Levinson who is the guy
[01:35:34.680 --> 01:35:39.480]  that ran the email service that was used by Ed Snowden if you remember the NSA
[01:35:39.480 --> 01:35:44.040]  came to latter Levinson and said give us all of his emails and he said no I'm not
[01:35:44.040 --> 01:35:49.280]  gonna do that and he shut his email service down his business down rather
[01:35:49.280 --> 01:35:54.120]  than turn that stuff over to the NSA so latter Levinson is somebody who who
[01:35:54.120 --> 01:35:58.240]  sincerely cares about respecting our individual rights that have been
[01:35:58.240 --> 01:36:02.360]  respected under the Constitution but ignored by our government he went to
[01:36:02.360 --> 01:36:07.320]  the trial and he told the Guardian he said this is the type of verdict that
[01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:12.240]  leads honorable men to take up the quill and pin strong statements but I fear
[01:36:12.240 --> 01:36:18.000]  that for some people words will not be sufficient so some people are not just
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:21.440]  going to be upset and right about this he's concerned some people are going to
[01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:29.480]  take action about that yeah yeah so he has kind of an interesting attitude
[01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:37.280]  Barrett said that he after exposing the cyber security military industrial
[01:36:37.280 --> 01:36:42.800]  complex he's now going to be investigating the cyber the prison
[01:36:42.800 --> 01:36:49.240]  industrial complex for the 35 months or so yeah and getting free food and
[01:36:49.240 --> 01:36:53.280]  clothing as he's going to be exposing their wrongdoing I like the attitude
[01:36:53.280 --> 01:36:59.640]  that he has he's very combative and we need to be combative we cannot just
[01:36:59.640 --> 01:37:04.040]  cower down in front of a government that is taking our freedoms he tried in
[01:37:04.040 --> 01:37:08.120]  his statement to the judge to be respectful but he says you know you
[01:37:08.120 --> 01:37:11.200]  gotta understand that I can be respectful and be regretful about how I
[01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:16.080]  have taken some other people's rights and still be angry about how mine were
[01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:21.960]  seized and that was essentially what was going on with the you know making the
[01:37:21.960 --> 01:37:28.640]  threat on YouTube against the FBI agent who had charged his mother who had
[01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:32.720]  essentially released his own personal information to try to get him attacked by
[01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:37.720]  the Zeta people of course there's no recrimination or no crimes that that FBI
[01:37:37.720 --> 01:37:42.400]  agent is charged with but then if you if he does that in return which is what he
[01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:47.600]  was talking about then they come after him with massive felonies yeah this
[01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:53.680]  stuff keeps happening non-stop I mean it's just I just don't even had to put
[01:37:53.680 --> 01:37:58.440]  it in words sometimes as a journalist you've got to watch your back every step
[01:37:58.440 --> 01:38:01.920]  of the way now because these guys are trying to come after you yeah yeah they
[01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:05.920]  want to threaten you but you go and you quote someone you want to use that
[01:38:05.920 --> 01:38:09.840]  against you and then threaten your mom and you know that's we just had the
[01:38:09.840 --> 01:38:13.320]  beginning of the program we had Obama talking about the emails from Hillary
[01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:17.880]  Clinton and he said several times he talked about how transparent they were
[01:38:17.880 --> 01:38:23.440]  I mean this is the least you know he ran on transparency the least transparent
[01:38:23.440 --> 01:38:27.760]  over the biggest lie I mean you know if people want it and they should get
[01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:31.320]  angry about the Democrats and everybody Republicans as well should get angry
[01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:36.840]  about the lies of George Bush that got us into Iraq about weapons of mass
[01:38:36.840 --> 01:38:42.120]  destruction how about getting angry about the big lie of the Obama
[01:38:42.120 --> 01:38:44.960]  administration at least one of them I mean you could come up with a lot of them
[01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:48.880]  but the one that they were going to base their administration on transparency
[01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:54.040]  and yet he has charged journalist after journalist every time something happens
[01:38:54.040 --> 01:38:57.360]  they go after the whistleblower and try to put the whistleblower in jail and
[01:38:57.360 --> 01:39:02.280]  they never correct the criminal actions that were done by the government
[01:39:02.280 --> 01:39:06.760]  officials or by the big banks we see the big banks constantly being given a
[01:39:06.760 --> 01:39:12.280]  pass we've got HSBC laundering money being caught laundering money for drug
[01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:17.400]  dealers for drug cartels for terrorist organizations and rather than put any of
[01:39:17.400 --> 01:39:21.480]  them in jail we had the Justice Department say that wouldn't serve the
[01:39:21.480 --> 01:39:25.880]  public interest to put any bank officials in jail that gave them a small
[01:39:25.880 --> 01:39:30.560]  fine compared to the amount of money that they had a profit that they had made
[01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:36.400]  and let these people walk I mean we don't we see them coming with draconian
[01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:40.040]  prosecutions against small people independent people but the biggest
[01:39:40.040 --> 01:39:46.840]  criminals go free you know and we see that over and over again we're still
[01:39:46.840 --> 01:39:50.280]  waiting for Barrett Brown hopefully he's going to be able to call us he was
[01:39:50.280 --> 01:39:55.720]  going to join us at 1233 I don't know if they shut that down maybe they maybe
[01:39:55.720 --> 01:39:58.520]  they're listening to us so I mean there could be a lockdown that happens in the
[01:39:58.520 --> 01:40:02.800]  prison who knows yeah their schedules are shifting I always tell me that he has
[01:40:02.800 --> 01:40:07.120]  lunch between one and three somewhere in that time they don't really give him an
[01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:10.180]  exact time but it's somewhere in that time so that's why we try to set up for
[01:40:10.180 --> 01:40:17.480]  1233 before that happens so well in terms of when you talk to him about Michael
[01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:23.880]  Hastings again what did he you know do you have any any insight as to what did
[01:40:23.880 --> 01:40:27.080]  he know about the circumstances of Michael Hastings death he hasn't been
[01:40:27.080 --> 01:40:31.720]  given all the full details about what's been going on but like I said the fact
[01:40:31.720 --> 01:40:35.480]  that the FBI came out and said no we're not investigating him and then they come
[01:40:35.480 --> 01:40:38.760]  out and say well we're looking into him for what they called controversial
[01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:43.720]  journalism when he was when he wrote the piece about Bo Bergdahl and they went
[01:40:43.720 --> 01:40:47.800]  investigating to him but they still deny the fact that they were looking into
[01:40:47.800 --> 01:40:51.440]  him for anything else and Bear Brown was saying I know for a fact that they were
[01:40:51.440 --> 01:40:55.120]  looking into him because he was a contact of mine when I was putting
[01:40:55.120 --> 01:41:00.160]  together project PM and he said the FBI had everyone's IP addresses anybody was
[01:41:00.160 --> 01:41:04.400]  in contact with him for that yeah that's right when when this first happened
[01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:08.320]  and we started following this we knew from looking at the way the accident
[01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:13.040]  happened that that didn't happen from him and the car did not explode and eject
[01:41:13.040 --> 01:41:18.680]  the engine at a right angle way down the road when it hit into a tree that
[01:41:18.680 --> 01:41:22.640]  never happens in the holds it there's no way that a vehicle is going to hit a
[01:41:22.640 --> 01:41:26.320]  tree and then the engine is going to like miraculously ricochet off and bounce
[01:41:26.320 --> 01:41:31.120]  down the road the engine was in the the path of travel yes yeah he was driving
[01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:33.760]  the way he was driving so that was consistent with the car being blown up
[01:41:33.760 --> 01:41:36.920]  and then going into a tree which was also consistent with the fact that the
[01:41:36.920 --> 01:41:41.360]  gas tank was not compromised in any way shape or form why would it catch fire if
[01:41:41.360 --> 01:41:46.120]  the gas and burn that thoroughly if the gas tank had not been compromised so we
[01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:49.680]  were concerned about that from the very beginning we said it looks like there
[01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:53.040]  was foul play here from the very beginning then it starts coming out that
[01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:57.080]  he is is tweeting people and emailing people saying I have to go undercover I'm
[01:41:57.080 --> 01:42:02.600]  on something very hot as we followed the investigation he was looking under his
[01:42:02.600 --> 01:42:05.920]  car looking into his car worried that somebody had put something on it a bomb
[01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:11.280]  even told the person that he was living with about that but it was tweeted out
[01:42:11.280 --> 01:42:16.360]  that he was being investigated by the FBI and the FBI denied that but then when
[01:42:16.360 --> 01:42:19.040]  you talked to Barrett Brown in prison he said well of course they were
[01:42:19.040 --> 01:42:21.560]  investigating him because they investigated everybody that was involved
[01:42:21.560 --> 01:42:24.840]  with Project PM well he said one of the things is you know everybody knows
[01:42:24.840 --> 01:42:31.840]  about Barrett Brown he went on a kind of a a rant and he was a you know high at
[01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:38.120]  the time and he said all during those times I never once imagined that I was
[01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:41.280]  being investigated by the FBI is like those things didn't just pop in my head
[01:42:41.280 --> 01:42:44.720]  he's like that's not a side effect of what I was taking he's like and the fact
[01:42:44.720 --> 01:42:48.040]  that the the government's coming out and the police officers and everyone out
[01:42:48.040 --> 01:42:53.160]  there are saying that he was being deranged and thought that the FBI was
[01:42:53.160 --> 01:42:56.080]  coming after him because of the drugs that he was on yeah he's just being
[01:42:56.080 --> 01:42:58.720]  paranoid yeah he's just like us yeah he just dreamed of like you don't he's a
[01:42:58.720 --> 01:43:02.200]  tenfold hat the journalist right it's like you don't just dream that stuff up
[01:43:02.200 --> 01:43:05.320]  he's like you start thinking that because you start seeing it happening yeah
[01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:09.160]  yeah you're not paranoid if they're actually watching you yeah and and that's
[01:43:09.160 --> 01:43:13.000]  the thing is that you know for the longest time Alex Jones has been talking
[01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:17.120]  about how they're monitoring our phone conversations they're monitoring our
[01:43:17.120 --> 01:43:22.280]  computer monitors are looking through the the cameras that on your monitor we
[01:43:22.280 --> 01:43:25.640]  knew that this was happening because we had people telling us we could even link
[01:43:25.640 --> 01:43:29.600]  to their articles even when we would link to the articles that other people
[01:43:29.600 --> 01:43:34.520]  had reported about David Petraeus bragging that your refrigerator is going
[01:43:34.520 --> 01:43:37.560]  to be spying on you he's going to be collecting information everything in
[01:43:37.560 --> 01:43:42.640]  your household the Internet of Things all of the things put together into a
[01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:47.120]  linked Internet they're going to be sending that information back to the
[01:43:47.120 --> 01:43:51.120]  government everybody laughed at us until the Snowden leaks that was the one
[01:43:51.120 --> 01:43:54.320]  thing that changed things around but we still haven't seen anything we've seen
[01:43:54.320 --> 01:43:58.720]  a public perception change of it and and and we've seen an acceptance of it
[01:43:58.720 --> 01:44:02.880]  almost by the public but not any change that's what's really dangerous and no
[01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:07.160]  one believes anything until you get your snopes article about it or it's not
[01:44:07.160 --> 01:44:10.280]  legit until one of these people say something and then all of a sudden well
[01:44:10.280 --> 01:44:13.840]  I guess those guys aren't crazy I guess they were right I mean I had to say
[01:44:13.840 --> 01:44:16.520]  that's the really dangerous thing because they just said I think it was
[01:44:16.520 --> 01:44:21.720]  last week that Google was going to go through a a different ranking schedule
[01:44:21.720 --> 01:44:26.200]  rather than looking at the popularity links coming into a website people
[01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:30.800]  visiting a website rather than using that to rank sites on the searches they
[01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:35.440]  were going to evaluate the truthfulness it's like who are they to evaluate the
[01:44:35.440 --> 01:44:38.880]  truthfulness and they even mentioned snopes as somebody that was going to be
[01:44:38.880 --> 01:44:42.960]  used to evaluate the truthfulness or something so if they say it doesn't
[01:44:42.960 --> 01:44:47.440]  happen then those articles are basically going to be delisted from the search
[01:44:47.440 --> 01:44:50.600]  engine and you're not going to be able to find a dissenting point of view no
[01:44:50.600 --> 01:44:54.240]  matter how popular that point of view is you're not going to find it with Google
[01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:59.640]  it's going to have to be done propaganda yeah it's gonna have to be done by we're
[01:44:59.640 --> 01:45:02.640]  essentially going to have to set up committees of correspondence and it's
[01:45:02.640 --> 01:45:05.520]  gonna have to be done outside of the kind of social media platforms that you
[01:45:05.520 --> 01:45:08.600]  see with Facebook and Twitter because they're going to start shutting that
[01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:12.480]  down as well so you're going to come up with some other way to share the
[01:45:12.480 --> 01:45:16.600]  information yeah this is going to use some kind of algorithm that will go
[01:45:16.600 --> 01:45:20.840]  through and it will decide whether or not it's true and just like Facebook
[01:45:20.840 --> 01:45:23.720]  coming out saying they're going to have a new button that you could report a
[01:45:23.720 --> 01:45:28.280]  story for fake news mm-hmm so you know you get all these trolls on there and it
[01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:31.760]  doesn't make multiple people clicking on fake news on that button the only takes
[01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:36.880]  one person well able to fake news and removed and we know that the government
[01:45:36.880 --> 01:45:41.920]  pays trolls we know that they have robotic programs that become trolls they
[01:45:41.920 --> 01:45:44.480]  they've worked very much on that I mean I don't even know that they're that
[01:45:44.480 --> 01:45:47.960]  they're still paying people at the Department of Justice and the FBI to
[01:45:47.960 --> 01:45:52.160]  troll our website or if they just got automated robots that do that with using
[01:45:52.160 --> 01:45:58.640]  AI but that's in snopes the guy the lady and their cat to determine what's
[01:45:58.640 --> 01:46:02.320]  real and not well the very dangerous thing about it is is that you know of
[01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:07.960]  course the whole system in terms of truthiness it is just it's another way
[01:46:07.960 --> 01:46:11.600]  that they're going to come after content they're looking at regulating content
[01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:16.440]  the FCC first started making moves again to regulate content and they've done
[01:46:16.440 --> 01:46:20.160]  that in the past they had the fairness doctrine for broadcast media and that was
[01:46:20.160 --> 01:46:25.720]  fortunately overturned and the Reagan administration by Bruce Fine who went on
[01:46:25.720 --> 01:46:30.640]  to work for Ron Paul but and that really opened things up and talk radio and
[01:46:30.640 --> 01:46:34.360]  then of course the internet opened up and so they've got to get those things
[01:46:34.360 --> 01:46:38.920]  shut down because that's the real threat to their base the real threat to
[01:46:38.920 --> 01:46:42.840]  their base is changing people's hearts and minds because if you don't change
[01:46:42.840 --> 01:46:47.000]  people's hearts and minds if somebody goes in and tries to reestablish the
[01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:51.240]  Constitution by force at this point they're going to be if the people aren't
[01:46:51.240 --> 01:46:55.720]  with them in sufficient mass they're going to just be looked at as the violent
[01:46:55.720 --> 01:46:59.440]  aggressors it's going to be very easy to shut down anybody who tries to use
[01:46:59.440 --> 01:47:02.880]  violence at this point that's why it's an information war you've got to get
[01:47:02.880 --> 01:47:06.560]  people's hearts and minds to understand that they said they're losing the
[01:47:06.560 --> 01:47:09.600]  information war that's why they're trying to shut down the internet that's
[01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:12.120]  why they're going after journalists like Barrett Brown they're trying to buy up
[01:47:12.120 --> 01:47:15.160]  all the ammo they're trying to make guns a little they're trying to pull away
[01:47:15.160 --> 01:47:17.840]  because they know there's going to be a great awakening going to happen very
[01:47:17.840 --> 01:47:20.760]  soon yeah people are going to start seeing through all these lies and BS
[01:47:20.760 --> 01:47:24.400]  that's why they're ramping up their game and American people need to ramp up
[01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:28.120]  their their their mind game their information to learn what's going on
[01:47:28.120 --> 01:47:31.120]  because these guys are getting ready they're buying the m-wraps they're
[01:47:31.120 --> 01:47:36.080]  putting them out in rural towns they're doing domestic training for you know
[01:47:36.080 --> 01:47:41.760]  assaults on American-looking cities you and I have been there we've walked the
[01:47:41.760 --> 01:47:46.120]  streets and that was one creepy feeling yes walking through the street with the
[01:47:46.120 --> 01:47:51.560]  traffic lights operating and everything a replica of American city there and and
[01:47:51.560 --> 01:47:54.480]  we know that they're training for this type of thing but going back to the
[01:47:54.480 --> 01:47:58.680]  truthfulness stuff when you talk about the ammo cells when Paul Joseph Watson
[01:47:58.680 --> 01:48:05.400]  found that and we broke that story he linked directly to the RFPs from the
[01:48:05.400 --> 01:48:09.480]  government saying we want these massive amounts of ammunition and they
[01:48:09.480 --> 01:48:13.840]  continued but they said it's not real even though he linked to the documents
[01:48:13.840 --> 01:48:18.000]  themselves the mainstream media pushed back on that and continued to push back
[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:21.760]  on it snopes themselves came back and said well you know they took one of the
[01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:25.360]  smallest ones from like the social security administration or the weather
[01:48:25.360 --> 01:48:29.360]  administration said look that's a very small amount they're just buying it for
[01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:32.680]  target practice it's like well why does the weather administration you know need
[01:48:32.680 --> 01:48:37.240]  to have arms exactly not it's not asking that question but they would cherry
[01:48:37.240 --> 01:48:42.120]  pick the different ones ignoring the billions major yeah the major stuff
[01:48:42.120 --> 01:48:46.480]  there and ignoring the fact that they were not buying target ammunition they're
[01:48:46.480 --> 01:48:50.960]  buying hollow point and ammunition well snopes completely ignore that as did the
[01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:55.840]  mainstream media ignoring the fact that that's extremely expensive that's
[01:48:55.840 --> 01:48:59.640]  ammunition that is banned by the Geneva Convention for use in war is anti
[01:48:59.640 --> 01:49:03.920]  personnel it was developed by the British in India to take out the the massive
[01:49:03.920 --> 01:49:08.040]  numbers of people to do the most harm to an individual so they banned it you know
[01:49:08.040 --> 01:49:12.200]  in a war scenario but it's used by governments against their people to keep
[01:49:12.200 --> 01:49:16.040]  them under control so they completely ignored that and that's what we're
[01:49:16.040 --> 01:49:21.440]  concerned about that they can push those stories down Joe even after this all
[01:49:21.440 --> 01:49:27.840]  broke even after you even had conservative news outlets like Breitbart
[01:49:27.840 --> 01:49:31.560]  picking this up and running with it even after you had congressman saying
[01:49:31.560 --> 01:49:36.280]  questioning why is Homeland Security buying so much ammunition even after all
[01:49:36.280 --> 01:49:41.760]  that we had national review come out and attack Alex Jones saying that he was
[01:49:41.760 --> 01:49:47.120]  some kind of a prophet of doom running some kind of a church thing or whatever
[01:49:47.120 --> 01:49:53.000]  and he was even getting the Republican congressman to join him in this
[01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:56.720]  nonsense about the government buying ammunition national review and that was a
[01:49:56.720 --> 01:50:02.720]  year after the story had broken well after Breitbart and other Fox had picked
[01:50:02.720 --> 01:50:05.840]  it up and said hey there's something here national review came out because they
[01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:10.720]  wanted to get Alex Jones that's the danger if we have truthfulness as the
[01:50:10.720 --> 01:50:17.120]  way that they rank and shut down websites exactly this stuff is not going to get
[01:50:17.120 --> 01:50:20.320]  any better and the American people need to wake up a lot quicker because like I
[01:50:20.320 --> 01:50:24.800]  said these guys are doing everything they can to ramp up their war against us
[01:50:24.800 --> 01:50:28.560]  taking our freedoms away our liberties are right to to say something or right
[01:50:28.560 --> 01:50:32.400]  to link to something or right to quote someone is all being used against us
[01:50:32.400 --> 01:50:37.320]  yeah absolutely well we're gonna be back in the next segment hopefully we can

[01:54:18.600 --> 01:54:23.000]  is Joe Biggs and we've been waiting for Barrett Brown who is going to call us at
[01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:28.560]  the bottom of the hour I don't know Joe maybe the FBI and the prison listening
[01:54:28.560 --> 01:54:32.400]  to Alex Jones show maybe they don't want to have him come on because they
[01:54:32.400 --> 01:54:36.280]  control that pretty tightly we were not able to call into Barrett Brown he has
[01:54:36.280 --> 01:54:42.080]  to call us so we were hoping that he'd be able to do that if he does call in
[01:54:42.080 --> 01:54:46.000]  later in the show in case it was something that was just circumstances
[01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:50.600]  and not outright censorship then we will certainly take his call whenever he
[01:54:50.600 --> 01:54:53.840]  calls in but yeah I just shot him a real quick email asking if everything was
[01:54:53.840 --> 01:55:00.240]  okay on his end that if anything comes up just to you know give me a call or
[01:55:00.240 --> 01:55:04.160]  shoot me an email so we can know that he's fine and mm-hmm there's no
[01:55:04.160 --> 01:55:08.240]  censorship going on as well yes and although we didn't get a call from
[01:55:08.240 --> 01:55:12.280]  Barrett Brown yet I did just get a call from Alex and we are launching an
[01:55:12.280 --> 01:55:16.280]  unprecedented sell on DNA force today just for a short period of time Alex
[01:55:16.280 --> 01:55:19.880]  wants everyone to be able to experience DNA force like he has and so we're
[01:55:19.880 --> 01:55:24.960]  launching a discount like we've never done before on that 30% off as of right
[01:55:24.960 --> 01:55:29.880]  now on DNA force better is already two to three times the price I'm charging up
[01:55:29.880 --> 01:55:35.680]  to $600 for a similar formula but right now you can get DNA force 30% off
[01:55:35.680 --> 01:55:41.240]  that's under $100 for the first time ever so you can find that at our site
[01:55:41.240 --> 01:55:46.480]  and that's how we support this operation that's how we send Joe Biggs to
[01:55:46.480 --> 01:55:51.600]  places like Chicago and Ferguson where he gets shot with rubber bullets tear
[01:55:51.600 --> 01:55:56.680]  gassed and frozen to death yeah I was on I was on tour this weekend with a band
[01:55:56.680 --> 01:56:00.040]  and all those guys take the supermail vitality they take it right before they
[01:56:00.040 --> 01:56:04.680]  go out on stage get them amped up they go out they perform and then you know go
[01:56:04.680 --> 01:56:07.360]  off and they said they love it they've been that's great for as long as they
[01:56:07.360 --> 01:56:11.680]  can so that's great that's great yeah supplements and and good natural
[01:56:11.680 --> 01:56:16.000]  healthy supplements as well not not something that you would normally expect
[01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:21.720]  to band you know we were talking about Michael Hastings and our concerns
[01:56:21.720 --> 01:56:27.480]  about what happened and you know we can we can guess as to how this might have
[01:56:27.480 --> 01:56:30.880]  happened we certainly know that what it wasn't was the narrative it's kind of
[01:56:30.880 --> 01:56:33.560]  like the Kennedy assassination you know you see these things happen you can say
[01:56:33.560 --> 01:56:37.120]  well it could have been done this way or that way but the way that they're
[01:56:37.120 --> 01:56:43.320]  telling us that would not work that's what we do this is just impossible yeah
[01:56:43.320 --> 01:56:47.280]  well they are you know one of the things about his car course and and one of
[01:56:47.280 --> 01:56:50.400]  the things that was interesting about Michael Hastings was you and other
[01:56:50.400 --> 01:56:55.120]  people had said that he was someone who drove extremely slowly he was a grandma
[01:56:55.120 --> 01:56:58.360]  okay but here's a guy who says I've got to get out of hand your name and see me
[01:56:58.360 --> 01:57:01.560]  for a while I'm being investigated I gotta he's he's concerned about his car
[01:57:01.560 --> 01:57:06.520]  and he's driving late at night punching all the lights going a hundred miles an
[01:57:06.520 --> 01:57:12.360]  hour down this road and in LA before the crash he's driving a Mercedes Mercedes
[01:57:12.360 --> 01:57:18.920]  has been at the forefront of driver assisted computer-controlled components
[01:57:18.920 --> 01:57:24.160]  which they're now merging together into these autonomous self-driving cars as
[01:57:24.160 --> 01:57:27.040]  I like to point out no self-driving is what you have now but that's the
[01:57:27.040 --> 01:57:31.160]  headline up there on Wired Magazine listen to what they say Joe they say the
[01:57:31.160 --> 01:57:36.320]  number of car crashes once we get these self-driving cars will plummet liberated
[01:57:36.320 --> 01:57:40.720]  from the need to keep our hands on the wheel and our eyes on the road drivers
[01:57:40.720 --> 01:57:44.360]  will become riders with more time for working leisure and staying in touch
[01:57:44.360 --> 01:57:48.160]  with loved ones in other words like pull that picture up again guys and show
[01:57:48.160 --> 01:57:53.800]  this the picture that they've got at the top is four people sitting and facing
[01:57:53.800 --> 01:58:00.400]  each other with virtual reality goggles yeah reality goggles on their head and
[01:58:00.400 --> 01:58:04.920]  that's what we've seen in the Mercedes vehicle they've got cameras on the
[01:58:04.920 --> 01:58:08.400]  outside of the car and projectors on the inside where you'd normally have
[01:58:08.400 --> 01:58:12.720]  windows to spare you from having to actually use your eyes to look outside
[01:58:12.720 --> 01:58:17.600]  yeah and you think these things are going to be safer nobody who's seen the
[01:58:17.600 --> 01:58:22.640]  blue screen of death from IBM really gonna want to get into a car where you
[01:58:22.640 --> 01:58:26.400]  don't have a steering wheel and you don't have any brakes because it's people
[01:58:26.400 --> 01:58:29.280]  who make mistakes that are going to be programming this this is the next step in
[01:58:29.280 --> 01:58:33.000]  the police say right here that's the way they control and that's the thing if you
[01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:38.480]  can't beat the car you can't control it you can assimilate it like the board stay

[02:00:30.160 --> 02:00:34.360]  again in this segment is Joe Bay we've still been waiting for a call from
[02:00:34.360 --> 02:00:37.960]  Barrett Brown it looked like someone was trying to call in on that line we weren't
[02:00:37.960 --> 02:00:42.080]  able to get through so we're gonna if we can get get him through we're going to
[02:00:42.080 --> 02:00:47.000]  go to him live depending on whatever segment we're in we're gonna go to him
[02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:52.240]  live but in the last segment Joe we were talking about these autonomous cars
[02:00:52.240 --> 02:00:56.840]  and I'm very concerned about it because of the control that it's going to give
[02:00:56.840 --> 02:01:00.120]  the government over our movements we should all be very concerned about that
[02:01:00.120 --> 02:01:04.280]  we should understand that this is something that the government has wanted
[02:01:04.280 --> 02:01:09.440]  to control movement in this country that's what's really behind the move for
[02:01:09.440 --> 02:01:13.640]  public transportation they don't like us having cars that we drive ourselves
[02:01:13.640 --> 02:01:16.800]  that's why they're offering us the quote-unquote self-driving cars the
[02:01:16.800 --> 02:01:21.080]  autonomous cars because they will be able to control it and they're going to
[02:01:21.080 --> 02:01:25.920]  push us out of our regular cars by these boxes that are being mandated the
[02:01:25.920 --> 02:01:30.160]  vehicle-to-vehicle boxes that are going to be constantly talking back and forth
[02:01:30.160 --> 02:01:33.960]  to each other with South by Southwest coming up they've got Department
[02:01:33.960 --> 02:01:36.800]  Transportation US Department Transportation officials coming here to
[02:01:36.800 --> 02:01:42.080]  Austin talking about v2v and the way they put it is talking cars it's just so
[02:01:42.080 --> 02:01:45.840]  special they're gonna try to make it sound so cool and trendy and yeah you
[02:01:45.840 --> 02:01:48.920]  know most people are just gonna go wow that's really neat I don't have to drive
[02:01:48.920 --> 02:01:52.000]  anymore I could just take a nap what you have to think about are the
[02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:55.360]  implications what if you're late on child support that car shuts down
[02:01:55.360 --> 02:02:00.040]  notifies the police and that is essentially a cage on wheels it locked
[02:02:00.040 --> 02:02:03.200]  the doors we know vehicles can be hacked we know they can be taken over this is
[02:02:03.200 --> 02:02:06.640]  another step in that and people they're gonna try to push it in a neat way
[02:02:06.640 --> 02:02:09.840]  they'll have Super Bowl lads will have all these celebrities come out showing
[02:02:09.840 --> 02:02:13.040]  you that it's the funnest thing out there to do that it's cool buy into it you
[02:02:13.040 --> 02:02:16.360]  should get one it's the new thing they're gonna control when you can go
[02:02:16.360 --> 02:02:21.320]  they're gonna control where you can go it's absolute control the government
[02:02:21.320 --> 02:02:24.920]  was involved in the creation of the interstate system primarily because the
[02:02:24.920 --> 02:02:29.560]  military had a use for it it was Eisenhower who wrote a book a small
[02:02:29.560 --> 02:02:33.640]  book about how he tried to take a division from one area of the United
[02:02:33.640 --> 02:02:36.640]  States to another and how difficult it was and then they saw the autobahn in
[02:02:36.640 --> 02:02:40.440]  Germany of course Hitler built the autobahn so that he could rapidly deploy
[02:02:40.440 --> 02:02:44.320]  forces across that so that was the rationale when Eisenhower became president
[02:02:44.320 --> 02:02:49.440]  to do that but of course on the other hand they've been hating on the car for
[02:02:49.440 --> 02:02:54.000]  the longest period of time and it isn't because they're concerned about car
[02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:57.920]  accidents it isn't because they're concerned about pollution or climate change
[02:02:57.920 --> 02:03:02.560]  it's because they don't like people having the ability to move themselves
[02:03:02.560 --> 02:03:06.280]  around they don't want us having owning our own cars the title of this article
[02:03:06.280 --> 02:03:09.840]  self-driving cars will make us want fewer cars and they said we can free
[02:03:09.840 --> 02:03:14.200]  ourselves from the arcade model of the multi-car household yeah who would want
[02:03:14.200 --> 02:03:18.160]  to have more than one car in a household we hate that and we won't waste so much
[02:03:18.160 --> 02:03:22.400]  parking space on the damn things that's what they said they're just they
[02:03:22.400 --> 02:03:27.120]  cannot stop their hatred of the car because it gives us freedom yeah they
[02:03:27.120 --> 02:03:29.400]  want full control of people they want to know what you're saying what you're
[02:03:29.400 --> 02:03:33.080]  doing who you're talking to I mean for kind of love the the new Corvette has
[02:03:33.080 --> 02:03:36.280]  what they call the valet mode they constantly listen to your conversation
[02:03:36.280 --> 02:03:40.360]  whether or not the the vehicle is on and they say it's for your safety as an
[02:03:40.360 --> 02:03:44.320]  owner to just be able to relax when you're not around your car that if a
[02:03:44.320 --> 02:03:49.240]  valet driver goes on this Ferris Bueller Day off journey that you can track all
[02:03:49.240 --> 02:03:52.760]  that but no what it really is so they can listen to what's going on inside that
[02:03:52.760 --> 02:03:57.120]  car absolutely when your business partner having a secret conversation about
[02:03:57.120 --> 02:03:59.720]  you know some kind of transaction that's going to happen whatever they're
[02:03:59.720 --> 02:04:03.680]  gonna use that so these self-driving cars are just gonna be microphones that
[02:04:03.680 --> 02:04:07.000]  can be hacked into everybody's gonna be able to listen to it when you start
[02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:12.280]  reading the the user terms and all that in there it'll even clearly so yeah like
[02:04:12.280 --> 02:04:15.120]  in my phone that the NSA can take whatever they want they're not
[02:04:15.120 --> 02:04:18.240]  responsible for any data that might be lost off from my phone due to their
[02:04:18.240 --> 02:04:21.840]  snooping around so this will be the same thing this is way beyond the Samsung
[02:04:21.840 --> 02:04:26.440]  television yes this is way beyond that yeah next step this is complete and total
[02:04:26.440 --> 02:04:30.680]  control over American citizens and this will be the beginning of enslavement and
[02:04:30.680 --> 02:04:34.120]  there's a kind of corporate fascism involved here as well because the CEO of
[02:04:34.120 --> 02:04:38.320]  uber has said what makes the cars expensive is the dude in the car once
[02:04:38.320 --> 02:04:42.680]  that dude goes away then the whole rationale for owning your car goes away
[02:04:42.680 --> 02:04:47.040]  but of course he will own all the cars and the government he'll work with the
[02:04:47.040 --> 02:04:50.280]  government to control your transportation wonder how many politicians are gonna be
[02:04:50.280 --> 02:04:54.160]  willing to drive or get him one of those things I doubt absolutely thanks for

[02:08:35.640 --> 02:08:40.840]  your host today and we're gonna be talking to Paul Joseph Watson before we
[02:08:40.840 --> 02:08:46.040]  go to Paul I just want to repeat yet again that there is a bill up by the GOP
[02:08:46.040 --> 02:08:53.120]  to actually shut down the ATF it's the ATF Elimination Act is being offered by
[02:08:53.120 --> 02:08:58.160]  Representative Jim Simpson Brenner of Wisconsin he's introduced legislation to
[02:08:58.160 --> 02:09:03.600]  abolish the agency and transfers duties to the FBI he says their very framework
[02:09:03.600 --> 02:09:07.640]  is an affront to the Second Amendment and another reason why Congress should
[02:09:07.640 --> 02:09:12.800]  pass the ATF Elimination Act absolutely write your congressman tell them you
[02:09:12.800 --> 02:09:16.320]  don't want them banning ammunition you can write the ATF if you want to hear
[02:09:16.320 --> 02:09:20.040]  them laugh and tell them that you don't like them making up these kinds of rules
[02:09:20.040 --> 02:09:25.040]  and just arbitrarily declaring that they're going to take away certain
[02:09:25.040 --> 02:09:29.040]  certain ammunition of course they'll extend that as they see fit the key
[02:09:29.040 --> 02:09:34.280]  thing is support him in this to eliminate the ATF let's get rid of one of
[02:09:34.280 --> 02:09:39.880]  these parasitic out-of-control government regulatory empires and the ATF is
[02:09:39.880 --> 02:09:44.040]  a great one to start with the ATF Elimination Act write your congressman
[02:09:44.040 --> 02:09:48.840]  tell them you want that passed now Paul Joseph Watson is joining us now I want
[02:09:48.840 --> 02:09:52.640]  to talk to Paul about this article he had up about team Hillary conducting
[02:09:52.640 --> 02:09:59.440]  secret polls to test fallout of email scandal what's up with that Paul well
[02:09:59.440 --> 02:10:04.960]  yeah this is an article that I wrote this morning which is out of a blog in
[02:10:04.960 --> 02:10:11.200]  Iowa and basically confirmed by the strategies we're getting a little bit
[02:10:11.200 --> 02:10:15.920]  people in Iowa likely Hillary Clinton voters and asking them a series of
[02:10:15.920 --> 02:10:21.480]  questions about their negative views towards Hillary Clinton so at first the
[02:10:21.480 --> 02:10:25.360]  speculation was you know is this poll being run by one of her potential
[02:10:25.360 --> 02:10:30.360]  Democratic challenges or is it being run by the Republicans but it since
[02:10:30.360 --> 02:10:34.720]  emerged that almost certainly it's it's being conducted by the Hillary Clinton
[02:10:34.720 --> 02:10:40.000]  campaign team itself so it seems as though in the aftermath of this email
[02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:44.760]  scandal they're very concerned about voter perception of Hillary Clinton
[02:10:44.760 --> 02:10:51.240]  because up until now she's had over 60% favorability ratings over her
[02:10:51.240 --> 02:10:56.840]  presumptive Republican challenges everyone from Jed Bush to Rand Paul that
[02:10:56.840 --> 02:11:01.320]  lead was fixed it was locked in for months and months beforehand now we see
[02:11:01.320 --> 02:11:05.840]  that margin of favorability in comparison to the Republican candidates
[02:11:05.840 --> 02:11:11.320]  starting to slip and it started to slip noticeably according to a new
[02:11:11.320 --> 02:11:16.920]  Washington Times poll after this email scandal emerged so this is being done
[02:11:16.920 --> 02:11:21.320]  under the radar but they're asking potential voters likely voters in Iowa
[02:11:21.320 --> 02:11:26.120]  a series of questions about whether Hillary Clinton can be trusted with
[02:11:26.120 --> 02:11:31.800]  national security whether she's a trustworthy person whether the Benghazi
[02:11:31.800 --> 02:11:36.280]  scandal was a real scandal or whether it was just hyped for political purposes
[02:11:36.280 --> 02:11:42.320]  so team Hillary is very concerned in the aftermath of this email scandal yeah
[02:11:42.320 --> 02:11:44.760]  and of course when we start talking about this you said there were there were
[02:11:44.760 --> 02:11:47.840]  speculations to whether or not it could be one of her Democrat opponents and
[02:11:47.840 --> 02:11:51.680]  there's not really much in terms of Democrat opponents or the Republicans
[02:11:51.680 --> 02:11:56.240]  because what they'll do of course Paul is negative push-pulling but that
[02:11:56.240 --> 02:12:01.160]  typically is done just before an election that's when it has the the most
[02:12:01.160 --> 02:12:06.200]  effect basically you call up and you ask the people on the telephone how would
[02:12:06.200 --> 02:12:09.560]  it affect you if you knew something and you tell them something negative about
[02:12:09.560 --> 02:12:15.760]  that candidate that's a way of basically dishing dirt on somebody without it
[02:12:15.760 --> 02:12:19.480]  sounding like you're dishing dirt on them it's a very effective method but I
[02:12:19.480 --> 02:12:22.040]  think this is far too early as you pointed out it looks like that's
[02:12:22.040 --> 02:12:26.160]  definitely coming from her so she's she's concerned that this is going to
[02:12:26.160 --> 02:12:29.800]  affect her it ought to put her in jail it shouldn't just get her out of the
[02:12:29.800 --> 02:12:33.600]  running for being a Democrat nominee but of course we seem to be very tolerant
[02:12:33.600 --> 02:12:39.200]  of criminals at the upper level of government nowadays aren't we well
[02:12:39.200 --> 02:12:43.280]  yeah and of course this was completely expected but the other article I wrote
[02:12:43.280 --> 02:12:48.840]  today on info was is now Hillary Clinton supporters are responding to the
[02:12:48.840 --> 02:12:54.800]  criticism of her because of this email scandal by characterizing it as sexist
[02:12:54.800 --> 02:13:02.120]  so you know years before or even after Obama was elected criticism of Obama
[02:13:02.120 --> 02:13:07.920]  amongst his supporters was characterized and sidelined as racism so now we're
[02:13:07.920 --> 02:13:11.960]  seeing the gender card being played over and over again by Hillary supporters
[02:13:11.960 --> 02:13:17.040]  and this is going to characterize the next 18 months going forward so the
[02:13:17.040 --> 02:13:23.240]  article on info was there's a daily cost blog which actually says that concern
[02:13:23.240 --> 02:13:29.440]  over Hillary keeping her emails hidden is based on quote republican fear of
[02:13:29.440 --> 02:13:34.080]  having a vagina in control of the White House that's a quote from the daily
[02:13:34.080 --> 02:13:39.000]  cost article they say that Hillary is an intelligent philanthropic loud and
[02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:44.560]  proud feminist that scares middle-aged white men so that's the reason why she's
[02:13:44.560 --> 02:13:48.480]  being questioned over these emails according to liberals and Hillary
[02:13:48.480 --> 02:13:52.000]  supporters is not because it you know illustrates the fact that she's
[02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:56.240]  completely untrustworthy can't be trusted with national security there's a
[02:13:56.240 --> 02:14:01.440]  huge gap as we found out yesterday from gaudy who's investigating this on CVS
[02:14:01.440 --> 02:14:05.480]  face the nation there's a huge gap in the emails which show that it looks like
[02:14:05.480 --> 02:14:11.080]  she's hiding communications during the whole Libya debacle but no that's not
[02:14:11.080 --> 02:14:15.360]  an issue that's not an example of untrustworthiness or corruption that's
[02:14:15.360 --> 02:14:19.240]  nothing to be concerned about and the only reason anybody's talking about it
[02:14:19.240 --> 02:14:24.800]  is because they're sexist yeah yeah but of course that's all that's all they see
[02:14:24.800 --> 02:14:30.520]  when they look at this is the fact that she's a woman nevertheless we have you
[02:14:30.520 --> 02:14:36.120]  know it's not a set a case of sexism as a case of felonious conduct we've had
[02:14:36.120 --> 02:14:42.080]  lisa jackson from the EPA also playing games with her email using a pseudonym to
[02:14:42.080 --> 02:14:46.160]  create she was driven out of the EPA she should have been put in prison we got
[02:14:46.160 --> 02:14:52.440]  Lois Lerner pretending that she's lost all these emails that would expose her
[02:14:52.440 --> 02:14:58.880]  to having targeted as political enemies different tea party groups she said I
[02:14:58.880 --> 02:15:03.120]  lost all those emails Hillary Clinton had her own private server for this she
[02:15:03.120 --> 02:15:08.360]  just didn't she didn't have just a email a different email account she had her
[02:15:08.360 --> 02:15:12.560]  own private server she was deliberately trying to set this apart into a
[02:15:12.560 --> 02:15:21.360]  parallel non-transparent secretive illegal activity exactly and I mean that's
[02:15:21.360 --> 02:15:26.680]  just one aspect of it but again if they can tie it to this gender issue to this
[02:15:26.680 --> 02:15:31.760]  sexism issue to this feminism issue they hope to dull the criticism that is
[02:15:31.760 --> 02:15:35.640]  inevitably going to be held at Hillary Clinton and there's another example of
[02:15:35.640 --> 02:15:40.880]  that today the Clinton Foundation the Bill Hillary and Chelsea Clinton
[02:15:40.880 --> 02:15:45.760]  Foundation released a video yesterday which just by coincidence got on the
[02:15:45.760 --> 02:15:49.720]  front page of YouTube not that they're promoting it at all it just got on the
[02:15:49.720 --> 02:15:54.800]  front page and got 300,000 views overnight and it's about basically it
[02:15:54.800 --> 02:15:59.760]  features a bunch of actresses Cameron Diaz all these top actresses decrying
[02:15:59.760 --> 02:16:06.200]  quote the wage gap in the United States now first of all the wage gap is a
[02:16:06.200 --> 02:16:12.760]  completely contrived myth you know this idea that women are being paid 77 cents
[02:16:12.760 --> 02:16:18.360]  on the dollar compared to men that's the average earnings if you take into factor
[02:16:18.360 --> 02:16:24.040]  differences in occupations and hours worked per week when you account for all
[02:16:24.040 --> 02:16:29.600]  those factors the wage gap completely vanishes so from the very foundation this
[02:16:29.600 --> 02:16:35.600]  argument is a debunked myth if you drill into the actual statistics and yet it's
[02:16:35.600 --> 02:16:40.400]  one being pushed by feminists and by the Hillary Clinton campaign because they've
[02:16:40.400 --> 02:16:44.880]  tied their car horse to third wave feminism so they're using the same
[02:16:44.880 --> 02:16:51.400]  debunked fraudulent argument to advance this agenda that Hillary Clinton is
[02:16:51.400 --> 02:16:56.120]  going to be fighting for women for equality in the United States when
[02:16:56.120 --> 02:17:01.760]  actually her own foundation the Clinton Foundation who released this video pays
[02:17:01.760 --> 02:17:09.480]  its female staff just 63 cents for every dollar that top senior male executives
[02:17:09.480 --> 02:17:14.880]  who work for the Clinton Foundation mate so there is a real wage gap
[02:17:14.880 --> 02:17:19.560]  controversy and it's within the Clinton Foundation itself nationwide in the
[02:17:19.560 --> 02:17:23.840]  United States it's a complete myth but if you look at the Clinton Foundation and
[02:17:23.840 --> 02:17:31.640]  their IRS tax filings have come out they're paying a 37% salary disparity
[02:17:31.640 --> 02:17:36.280]  between what they pay male executives and what they pay female executives and
[02:17:36.280 --> 02:17:43.820]  they're going to fix the wage gap in the United States again rampant
[02:17:43.820 --> 02:17:50.440]  hypocrisy she is advancing that wage gap within her own foundation exactly and
[02:17:50.440 --> 02:17:53.400]  that's the key as you're pointing out within her own foundation when they
[02:17:53.400 --> 02:17:58.080]  look at female executives versus male executives within that same business they
[02:17:58.080 --> 02:18:02.640]  see that kind of wage disparity that would be a genuine disparity but when
[02:18:02.640 --> 02:18:06.960]  they look at it across the population as a whole like Cameron Diaz did then
[02:18:06.960 --> 02:18:10.440]  they're not can they're not comparing and and adjusting for the fact that women
[02:18:10.440 --> 02:18:13.720]  are in a different kind of profession than men would be or that they're not
[02:18:13.720 --> 02:18:17.720]  working their entire life or that they're working part-time and staying at
[02:18:17.720 --> 02:18:20.640]  home with the children part-time the different career choices that they make
[02:18:20.640 --> 02:18:23.920]  will adjust that so it's a very simplistic thing to go back at the data
[02:18:23.920 --> 02:18:29.040]  and just kind of cut it and say women's salaries and men's salaries and not drill
[02:18:29.040 --> 02:18:32.440]  down and look at it so that you know you're making valid comparisons with
[02:18:32.440 --> 02:18:35.120]  those that's how they get there but Paul you're talking about how this is
[02:18:35.120 --> 02:18:39.000]  within her foundation there's a story on a drug report today in the New York
[02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:44.240]  Times saying that she faces a test of record as a woman's advocate so here
[02:18:44.240 --> 02:18:47.400]  they are saying this this is people coming after her just because she's a
[02:18:47.400 --> 02:18:50.560]  woman so we need to defend her because she's a woman and yet her foundation
[02:18:50.560 --> 02:18:55.160]  is accepting millions of dollars according to New York Times and donations
[02:18:55.160 --> 02:18:59.080]  from Middle Eastern countries that are known for violence against women and
[02:18:59.080 --> 02:19:04.080]  for denying them their basic freedoms not allowing them to drive cars or
[02:19:04.080 --> 02:19:07.960]  whatever one of the nations that comes to mind of course is Saudi Arabia one of
[02:19:07.960 --> 02:19:13.480]  the most oppressive regimes anywhere and of course one of our closest allies
[02:19:13.480 --> 02:19:19.400]  closest allies to the CIA what are your comments Paul well it's part of the
[02:19:19.400 --> 02:19:24.800]  course because you know feminists share the same rampant hypocrisy and ignorance
[02:19:24.800 --> 02:19:30.480]  of actual women's rights issues you know Saudi Arabia passed a law whereby
[02:19:30.480 --> 02:19:36.440]  female drivers would be characterized and considered under the law as terrorists
[02:19:36.440 --> 02:19:40.960]  so again it goes back to this issue of feminists only concentrate on issues
[02:19:40.960 --> 02:19:46.400]  through which they can demonize the Western white male patriarchy actual
[02:19:46.400 --> 02:19:51.520]  women's rights issues especially in the Middle East we're talking to Paul
[02:19:51.520 --> 02:19:56.000]  Joseph Watson and the subject is of course Hillary Clinton's dirty e-mails

[02:24:21.800 --> 02:24:28.680]  missing emails and there's a story up on the dredge report actually by National
[02:24:28.680 --> 02:24:34.360]  Journal Ron Fournier says emails may be a key to addressing the quote pay to play
[02:24:34.360 --> 02:24:40.040]  whispers at the Clinton Foundation in other words follow the money are people
[02:24:40.040 --> 02:24:45.040]  giving money to the Clinton Foundation in order to get influence are they buying
[02:24:45.040 --> 02:24:50.800]  influence that's almost a self-obvious question but let's go to this exchange on
[02:24:50.800 --> 02:24:55.440]  CNN I want to get Paul's comments on this this is State Department spokesperson
[02:24:55.440 --> 02:25:00.400]  Jen Jen Saki commenting on foreign donations and there's some commentary
[02:25:00.400 --> 02:25:06.320]  from this author the National Journal as well as from Julie Pace of the AP so
[02:25:06.320 --> 02:25:09.640]  here's the State Department spokesperson talking about Hillary Clinton
[02:25:09.640 --> 02:25:14.440]  accepting these foreign donations at the Clinton Foundation we like to review and
[02:25:14.440 --> 02:25:20.880]  we have reviewed every every donation that has been submitted but in this case
[02:25:20.880 --> 02:25:25.960]  the fact that the process has that was not followed in this particular incident
[02:25:25.960 --> 02:25:30.800]  does not raise concerns with us we like to review and we have reviewed every
[02:25:30.800 --> 02:25:34.320]  donation turns out that's not true they didn't review any of them she either made
[02:25:34.320 --> 02:25:38.480]  that up just to try to get past a new cycle or she lied either way that's an
[02:25:38.480 --> 02:25:43.080]  excusable but it again gets back to you know what you said this idea that even
[02:25:43.080 --> 02:25:50.000]  if there is nothing inherently bad about the donations or nothing inherently bad
[02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:55.840]  in the emails raises the question of why why do you even bother to do something
[02:25:55.840 --> 02:25:58.520]  that just gives off the impression that you're hiding something or that you're
[02:25:58.520 --> 02:26:01.200]  you are doing something fraudulent especially if you have in the back of
[02:26:01.200 --> 02:26:04.840]  your mind the idea that you're going to run for trial and of course it's the
[02:26:04.840 --> 02:26:11.200]  cover-up isn't it it wasn't so much the crimes of Nixon but it was the cover-up
[02:26:11.200 --> 02:26:17.160]  that was really serious the cover-up that they internalized by helping to
[02:26:17.160 --> 02:26:21.560]  propagate that that Nixon made his own by covering up your comments on that
[02:26:21.560 --> 02:26:27.960]  Paul well the cover-up is in place because this directly threatens
[02:26:27.960 --> 02:26:33.960]  brand Clinton just like you know Obama was built on you know the first black
[02:26:33.960 --> 02:26:38.560]  president representing the entirety of America if she's taken down by this kind
[02:26:38.560 --> 02:26:42.680]  of scandal that she's receiving donations from governments in the Middle East
[02:26:42.680 --> 02:26:47.360]  and corporate interests in the Middle East that are fundamentally diametrically
[02:26:47.360 --> 02:26:52.640]  opposed to women's rights which is where you know I get emails from feminists
[02:26:52.640 --> 02:26:57.000]  actual real feminists who care about women's rights issues who work in the
[02:26:57.000 --> 02:27:01.520]  Middle East and they're appalled by the kind of rhetoric that comes out of
[02:27:01.520 --> 02:27:07.080]  third-wave feminists in the United States in the West so you know if that's
[02:27:07.080 --> 02:27:11.120]  exposed that Hillary has been taking donations from these kind of groups it
[02:27:11.120 --> 02:27:16.960]  will completely eviscerate a large part of the foundation of her campaign for
[02:27:16.960 --> 02:27:21.720]  2016 because she's tied her entire campaign to this issue of being a
[02:27:21.720 --> 02:27:26.400]  woman's advocate that's what it's all going to be based around heading towards
[02:27:26.400 --> 02:27:31.960]  2016 over the next 18 months which is why she threw her support behind this
[02:27:31.960 --> 02:27:37.800]  huge NBA campaign to basically lecture men about how they've got it so easy and
[02:27:37.800 --> 02:27:42.200]  how they need to do more housework in the home so that's why it's crystallizing
[02:27:42.200 --> 02:27:46.640]  into such a big issue right before we learn who's actually going to run for
[02:27:46.640 --> 02:27:52.040]  2016 and that's why they're so defensive because it could derail her entire
[02:27:52.040 --> 02:27:57.120]  campaign before it even begins. That's why you've got the New York Times not
[02:27:57.120 --> 02:28:02.480]  typically opposed to Hillary saying she faces the test of her record if she's
[02:28:02.480 --> 02:28:05.640]  going to claim that she's a woman's advocate and of course Paul when we look
[02:28:05.640 --> 02:28:09.480]  at what's happening in countries like Saudi Arabia and others against women
[02:28:09.480 --> 02:28:13.400]  it's also men's rights that they're attacking there in those countries as
[02:28:13.400 --> 02:28:17.280]  well I mean look at the blogger who's getting flogged repeatedly life
[02:28:17.280 --> 02:28:21.520]  threatening punishment that they gave against him but they do all that to
[02:28:21.520 --> 02:28:25.280]  men which is bad enough but then they do that as well to women and then they
[02:28:25.280 --> 02:28:29.800]  have some special things that they do for women don't they? That's what makes us
[02:28:29.800 --> 02:28:36.600]  so egregious. Exactly and that kind of genuine real repression which actual
[02:28:36.600 --> 02:28:40.840]  women's rights advocates write to me about on a regular basis is what third
[02:28:40.840 --> 02:28:46.240]  wave feminism completely ignores it's like the Muslim rape scandal in England
[02:28:46.240 --> 02:28:53.000]  for 17 years there were groups of Muslim Pakistani men abducting white
[02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:57.120]  British girls off the streets and the local government and the police
[02:28:57.120 --> 02:29:02.160]  dismissed the issue called all the victims liars because they didn't want
[02:29:02.160 --> 02:29:07.640]  to be called politically incorrect or racist that was a huge controversy over
[02:29:07.640 --> 02:29:12.800]  the past few months in the United Kingdom not a word from all the third wave
[02:29:12.800 --> 02:29:16.960]  feminists the most prominent feminists on the internet not a single word
[02:29:16.960 --> 02:29:22.480]  complete radio silence and it's this hypocrisy which characterizes the entire
[02:29:22.480 --> 02:29:27.280]  movement which Hillary Clinton has now become a part of so that's why we need
[02:29:27.280 --> 02:29:31.480]  to you know control this narrative going forward. She'll do anything. Because it will
[02:29:31.480 --> 02:29:36.600]  eviscerate Hillary's campaign as she goes into 2016. She'll do anything to pose for
[02:29:36.600 --> 02:29:39.320]  that we got to go to a commercial break we're gonna be right back with Paul
[02:29:39.320 --> 02:29:42.640]  Joseph Watson we should be concerned about human rights but especially
[02:29:42.640 --> 02:29:47.480]  somebody who takes money from the people who specifically target women for
[02:29:47.480 --> 02:29:50.800]  special punishments stay with us we'll be right back. We're on the march the

[02:33:24.440 --> 02:33:27.880]  hour we were anxiously awaiting the call of Barrett Brown from prison and of
[02:33:27.880 --> 02:33:31.400]  course if you haven't been following Barrett Brown's story you should be
[02:33:31.400 --> 02:33:34.560]  that's one of the reasons we're having him on here because it affects press
[02:33:34.560 --> 02:33:38.000]  freedom throughout the United States and coming back into the studio with me
[02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:42.200]  now is Joe Biggs we still have I think Paul Joseph Watson on the phone from the
[02:33:42.200 --> 02:33:46.040]  UK so we've got a lot of people online here but let's go to Barrett Brown Barrett
[02:33:46.040 --> 02:33:50.440]  I wanted to give you a chance to talk to the public we talked about your
[02:33:50.440 --> 02:33:54.440]  comments to the judge saying that this isn't about the rule of law anymore we
[02:33:54.440 --> 02:33:58.880]  now have the rule of law enforcement tell us what you want to tell us about
[02:33:58.880 --> 02:34:04.000]  your trial now that the gag order has been taken off. Well the first thing I
[02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:08.400]  should mention is that aside from what I put forth in the article for the Daily
[02:34:08.400 --> 02:34:12.480]  Beast about a month ago and aside from what I'll tell you about today the great
[02:34:12.480 --> 02:34:15.120]  majority of the things that people didn't know about the trial are still
[02:34:15.120 --> 02:34:19.720]  sealed and that'll that'll that should continue for about six months so in
[02:34:19.720 --> 02:34:22.360]  addition to all the all the very egregious things that have happened
[02:34:22.360 --> 02:34:27.080]  that there's there's a great deal more that's still not public now regarding
[02:34:27.080 --> 02:34:31.720]  the trial I guess the basic lesson here is that the federal government can do
[02:34:31.720 --> 02:34:34.480]  whatever it wants essentially within the Department of Justice within the
[02:34:34.480 --> 02:34:37.680]  federal justice system that's that's clear from the extent of the perjury
[02:34:37.680 --> 02:34:41.800]  very demonstrable perjury that occurred in this case but again some of which is
[02:34:41.800 --> 02:34:45.520]  visible some of which can be confirmed publicly through documents some of which
[02:34:45.520 --> 02:34:48.640]  is still sealed and that's really what I've tried to convey to the judge and
[02:34:48.640 --> 02:34:53.960]  that the allegation I gave is that you know when you allow this perjury to
[02:34:53.960 --> 02:34:58.040]  occur we're getting away from the rule of law we're getting to a situation in
[02:34:58.040 --> 02:35:01.880]  which we're going to the forums we're meeting a nice very pretty hardwood
[02:35:01.880 --> 02:35:06.440]  room with paintings and it's a big nice wood podium and very pretty ropes and
[02:35:06.440 --> 02:35:09.680]  all that but you're missing something which is the rule of law and to the
[02:35:09.680 --> 02:35:12.880]  extent the rule of law isn't there you're gonna see things like anonymous
[02:35:12.880 --> 02:35:16.480]  you're gonna see things like WikiLeaks you're gonna keep seeing until we get the
[02:35:16.480 --> 02:35:20.840]  rule of law one of the things that reading the transcript the judge dressed
[02:35:20.840 --> 02:35:25.800]  down the prosecutor for not referring to you as Mr. Brown and I as you're just
[02:35:25.800 --> 02:35:28.600]  talking about you you've got this fancy room with all the trappings and
[02:35:28.600 --> 02:35:32.080]  everything but they're grinding the rule of law into the ground and I thought
[02:35:32.080 --> 02:35:36.920]  he's worried about being polite to people while he's doing that while he's
[02:35:36.920 --> 02:35:40.920]  railroading this whole process that thing is that kind of thing is very
[02:35:40.920 --> 02:35:45.000]  important to establishment characters in DC it's very important to the people
[02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:48.360]  who have that federal government mentality you know I would have preferred him to
[02:35:48.360 --> 02:35:54.440]  object at the last hearing when the prosecutor asked the FBI agent how long
[02:35:54.440 --> 02:35:57.920]  is Barry Brownman an anarchist that would have been the time to object when
[02:35:57.920 --> 02:36:02.200]  they start asking about my political ideology and incidentally this thing
[02:36:02.200 --> 02:36:05.760]  about me being an anarchist which is true that actually comes up in a couple
[02:36:05.760 --> 02:36:10.040]  of other documents including the the gag order when when they when they ask for
[02:36:10.040 --> 02:36:12.880]  me to be gagged well being an anarchist is one of the reasons they
[02:36:12.880 --> 02:36:17.360]  cited in one of the documents that still sealed regarding my sentencing they
[02:36:17.360 --> 02:36:21.480]  call for me to give an additional prison time because I'm an anarchist and thus
[02:36:21.480 --> 02:36:26.840]  more likely apparently to commit crimes so there's a lot of egregious things that
[02:36:26.840 --> 02:36:30.600]  on an individual basis really should have been a national story you know on
[02:36:30.600 --> 02:36:34.280]  each given thing obviously the seizure of the Declaration of Independence in a
[02:36:34.280 --> 02:36:38.360]  more perfect world would have been a major news story yes unfortunately the
[02:36:38.360 --> 02:36:41.920]  world we're in it didn't quite didn't quite rate national coverage yes that
[02:36:41.920 --> 02:36:47.000]  was amazing tell the audience about that well among the items that you can see
[02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:51.880]  this this is links to from my my daily beast article my post cyberpunk and
[02:36:51.880 --> 02:36:56.360]  entered servitude you can find online you know we have the list of items they
[02:36:56.360 --> 02:37:00.960]  sees as you know evidence of a crime and your computers it's my notes there's
[02:37:00.960 --> 02:37:04.200]  only one book they took I have a lot of books in my apartment at the time and
[02:37:04.200 --> 02:37:07.600]  the only book they took was a copy of the Declaration of Independence just a
[02:37:07.600 --> 02:37:11.560]  little pocket copy let's rather explain never have to explain why they took it
[02:37:11.560 --> 02:37:15.960]  I'm assuming it has to do something to do with the FBI member and a few years
[02:37:15.960 --> 02:37:20.040]  ago when they said you know patriots of militia types they like the Constitution
[02:37:20.040 --> 02:37:23.440]  they might have a copy of Constitution thus having a copy the Constitution might
[02:37:23.440 --> 02:37:26.480]  be up into the crime I'm assuming they just sort of got it mixed up with one
[02:37:26.480 --> 02:37:29.560]  of those one of those enlightenment documents you know FBI agents aren't
[02:37:29.560 --> 02:37:33.080]  as educated as we might expect them to be or might help them to be anyway so
[02:37:33.080 --> 02:37:35.480]  they just grabbed it and then you know never came up with the trial would have
[02:37:35.480 --> 02:37:39.880]  been even for them it would have been a little much to actually discuss that you
[02:37:39.880 --> 02:37:44.400]  know in the course of the trial so well of course yeah they never want us to read
[02:37:44.400 --> 02:37:47.760]  even the first paragraph of that when it says we create governments to establish
[02:37:47.760 --> 02:37:50.440]  our rights and when they destroy our rights we have the duty and the
[02:37:50.440 --> 02:37:54.080]  obligation to alter abolish those governments one other thing I wanted to
[02:37:54.080 --> 02:37:58.440]  get to and then just you can talk I'll let Joe ask you a question here one of
[02:37:58.440 --> 02:38:01.240]  things you mentioned the but at the end of the article was two days before your
[02:38:01.240 --> 02:38:04.040]  sentence thing in the Department of Justice withheld from the defense team
[02:38:04.040 --> 02:38:18.560]  chat transcripts from Jeremy Hammond tell us about that
[02:38:18.560 --> 02:38:23.200]  we had no idea of the Department of Justice had documents that show quite
[02:38:23.200 --> 02:38:28.560]  quite demonstrably that I was not a co-conspirator in the strap rack which
[02:38:28.560 --> 02:38:34.680]  was a major point you know the DOJ's favor in getting me actually getting
[02:38:34.680 --> 02:38:38.280]  me initial prison time this claim that I was somehow a co-conspirator and they
[02:38:38.280 --> 02:38:42.680]  withheld that evidence and the evidence is now public it's it was made public
[02:38:42.680 --> 02:38:47.040]  before my sentence thing and this is something that again a more perfect
[02:38:47.040 --> 02:38:50.560]  world the judge would care about just as much as he cares about what I'm called
[02:38:50.560 --> 02:38:58.080]  Mr. Brown or Barrett or whatever but it just didn't quite didn't quite come to
[02:38:58.080 --> 02:39:03.520]  his attention didn't quite interest him very much you know it's it's actually
[02:39:03.520 --> 02:39:07.880]  just goes to show this particular case you know obviously it's inconvenient to
[02:39:07.880 --> 02:39:11.160]  be in prison but on the other hand we have a great example here this whole
[02:39:11.160 --> 02:39:15.800]  case the investigation to all the way to the sentence thing of how this system
[02:39:15.800 --> 02:39:20.820]  works particularly if the DOJ wants you you know very much wants you to do
[02:39:20.820 --> 02:39:25.280]  prison time it's a great example of how they're able to get away with these
[02:39:25.280 --> 02:39:29.200]  things even in the public eye and there's the other story here of course
[02:39:29.200 --> 02:39:35.520]  is how poorly the mainstream media does in keeping up with these things
[02:39:35.520 --> 02:39:38.440]  absolutely we spoke on the phone the other day Barrett and you're talking
[02:39:38.440 --> 02:39:42.320]  about I was asking you what you knew about the Michael Hastings you know
[02:39:42.320 --> 02:39:47.120]  case and how the FBI came out and said that they weren't looking into him and
[02:39:47.120 --> 02:39:51.000]  you said that you believe that you know 99% that FBI was definitely looking to
[02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:55.560]  him yeah it's even even aside from the other reasons they would have to look
[02:39:55.560 --> 02:39:58.760]  into him it's absolutely ludicrous for them to say that because with regards to
[02:39:58.760 --> 02:40:03.240]  my group Project PM which runs the echelon 2.org website which was really
[02:40:03.240 --> 02:40:08.320]  what this case was all about you know they they they subpoenaed the IP address
[02:40:08.320 --> 02:40:11.160]  information for everyone who's ever contributed to that to that website of
[02:40:11.160 --> 02:40:16.040]  ours and so these are just sort of small players within Project PM now Michael
[02:40:16.040 --> 02:40:19.040]  Hastings on the other hand as I noted in a fair article a number of years ago
[02:40:19.040 --> 02:40:22.400]  when he was still alive and when I was writing about him you know he was
[02:40:22.400 --> 02:40:26.080]  instrumental when I was first creating Project PM and helping me sort of flesh
[02:40:26.080 --> 02:40:30.440]  out the philosophy of it so the idea that he who was in contact with me
[02:40:30.440 --> 02:40:35.000]  regarding Project PM was never investigated regarding Project PM is
[02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:38.920]  absolutely 100% ludicrous and again that's that's in addition to the other
[02:40:38.920 --> 02:40:41.960]  reasons they and other certain other organizations would have to be
[02:40:41.960 --> 02:40:45.800]  investigating and harassing him he obviously did a great job he's well
[02:40:45.800 --> 02:40:49.080]  he's best known for for forcing the crystal to resign number of years ago
[02:40:49.080 --> 02:40:54.200]  but really his article exposing the PsyOps campaign used by I believe a two-star
[02:40:54.200 --> 02:40:57.440]  general in Afghanistan against visiting senators that's something I cite
[02:40:57.440 --> 02:41:01.400]  constantly in my articles to the Guardian or whatever as evidence of here's what
[02:41:01.400 --> 02:41:06.360]  these people are willing to do even to your elected officials and it's again
[02:41:06.360 --> 02:41:09.240]  it is absolutely ludicrous that they're their claim they weren't
[02:41:09.240 --> 02:41:13.160]  investigated they absolutely were almost certainly on several different issues
[02:41:13.160 --> 02:41:16.200]  I know we don't have much time there before we get cut off but Paul Joseph
[02:41:16.200 --> 02:41:20.920]  Watson is in the UK and he's got a quick question for you Paul yeah I just wanted
[02:41:20.920 --> 02:41:24.520]  to ask Barrett obviously one of the charges is the fact that he merely
[02:41:24.520 --> 02:41:30.800]  provided a link to the strat for email leaks what kind of precedent does that
[02:41:30.800 --> 02:41:36.600]  create for web publishers for activists going forward well it means that the
[02:41:36.600 --> 02:41:41.080]  federal government now has a expanded toolkit a vastly expanded toolkit by
[02:41:41.080 --> 02:41:43.960]  which to come after anyone that they wanted to come after to begin with
[02:41:43.960 --> 02:41:48.440]  whether or not they've actually committed a crime by by criminalizing the
[02:41:48.440 --> 02:41:51.100]  active linking especially in my case when you don't even know what you're
[02:41:51.100 --> 02:41:56.800]  linking to and had no interest or use for for the in this turn it's turned out
[02:41:56.800 --> 02:41:59.120]  to be credit card numbers in addition to other information that I ended up
[02:41:59.120 --> 02:42:03.400]  linking to which is already public that that's that's a terrible precedent by
[02:42:03.400 --> 02:42:07.640]  which journalists researchers are now at risk and of course there are some
[02:42:07.640 --> 02:42:12.840]  journalists and researchers who are a danger to the government and especially
[02:42:12.840 --> 02:42:16.760]  the DOJ and thus you know the DOJ now has one more option by which to come
[02:42:16.760 --> 02:42:21.800]  after them Quinn Norton who writes for Wired who testified at my hearing she
[02:42:21.800 --> 02:42:25.920]  explained a few days afterwards after this decision that she was going to stop
[02:42:25.920 --> 02:42:30.160]  doing security reporting that it's too dangerous she told us to the judge the
[02:42:30.160 --> 02:42:32.600]  judge at my hearing said you know I'm gonna go ahead and hit him with this
[02:42:32.600 --> 02:42:36.680]  this additional year in prison for the linking I don't think it's gonna be a
[02:42:36.680 --> 02:42:39.800]  concern to journalists which is bizarre because of course journalists have been
[02:42:39.800 --> 02:42:43.600]  expressing concern about this those charges ever since they were made two
[02:42:43.600 --> 02:42:47.400]  years ago and even at right after my five sentencing there was number of
[02:42:47.400 --> 02:42:51.760]  articles in US news and will report Columbia journalism review the intercepts
[02:42:51.760 --> 02:42:56.680]  again expressing concern about this so the judge is not a brilliant flower of
[02:42:56.680 --> 02:42:59.600]  jurisprudence or anything really he's just he's just sort of a puppet of the
[02:42:59.600 --> 02:43:03.720]  DOJ which is not a not a bad guy to just know what he's doing and so again a
[02:43:03.720 --> 02:43:06.720]  last that's that situation we're in now now hopefully something will come of
[02:43:06.720 --> 02:43:10.800]  this in the case in general hopefully people will make use of what's happened
[02:43:10.800 --> 02:43:15.480]  in my case to bring some attention to to the mainstream because again this
[02:43:15.480 --> 02:43:18.920]  affects journalists and you know when you start coming after journalists then
[02:43:18.920 --> 02:43:22.040]  you start you have the option the potential to get journalists attention
[02:43:22.040 --> 02:43:26.520]  especially when you're quoting somebody like a Fox News contributor sorry
[02:43:26.520 --> 02:43:31.360]  especially when you're quoting someone Fox News contributor and then they use
[02:43:31.360 --> 02:43:34.720]  that against you that quote yeah and that's that's really I think the most
[02:43:34.720 --> 02:43:38.480]  bizarre the number one most bizarre thing in a comedy of bizarre errors the
[02:43:38.480 --> 02:43:41.920]  fact that a Fox News commentator went on television and talks about how you
[02:43:41.920 --> 02:43:45.840]  wanted we should murder Julian Assange I quoted that on my Twitter account you
[02:43:45.840 --> 02:43:49.840]  know of course Julian Assange is someone who I respect and he respects me we
[02:43:49.840 --> 02:43:55.760]  have sort of an association you know they that ended up my indictment as if
[02:43:55.760 --> 02:43:59.960]  it was something that I said or you know approved of and even after we pointed
[02:43:59.960 --> 02:44:03.720]  out you know in a profiling that you know this Brown didn't say this this is
[02:44:03.720 --> 02:44:08.520]  the other guy that Brown obviously wouldn't get along with saying it the
[02:44:08.520 --> 02:44:11.600]  prosecution stuck with it instead of saying others the mistake you're right
[02:44:11.600 --> 02:44:14.840]  they stuck with it and said yes he's promoting this quote which is again
[02:44:14.840 --> 02:44:19.040]  really raises the question of it's a terrible quote that even promoting gets
[02:44:19.040 --> 02:44:21.600]  you indicted that how come the guy who started on national television hasn't
[02:44:21.600 --> 02:44:25.320]  been indicted and the answer of course is because the guy on Fox News is not a
[02:44:25.320 --> 02:44:30.880]  danger to the DOJ he's he like commentators are both left and right you
[02:44:30.880 --> 02:44:34.800]  know it is an establishment character on his own you know he just dislikes
[02:44:34.800 --> 02:44:38.920]  WikiLeaks dislikes sort of anti-government things of that nature and
[02:44:38.920 --> 02:44:42.400]  thus will never get that kind of indictment and then that goes into
[02:44:42.400 --> 02:44:46.000]  another big problem here is the selectivity that the picking and
[02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:50.920]  choosing the DOJ can do what has done as we exposed as we show with the HB
[02:44:50.920 --> 02:44:55.840]  Gary and Team Themis scandal in 2011 the picking and choosing they can do who
[02:44:55.840 --> 02:45:00.240]  they prosecute under these very broad statutes in addition to that the the
[02:45:00.240 --> 02:45:04.920]  bizarre sort of underground concierge service the DOJ seems to provide to
[02:45:04.920 --> 02:45:09.360]  certain companies that happen to you know have common enemies with them that's
[02:45:09.360 --> 02:45:11.720]  something I don't think we have time to get into but if people want to go to
[02:45:11.720 --> 02:45:16.120]  echelon2.org they'll see some of the research that really kicked off this
[02:45:16.120 --> 02:45:19.960]  trend that really sort of forced the DOJ to come after me the research that
[02:45:19.960 --> 02:45:25.440]  anonymous and my to illegal activity by the DOJ and certain companies and
[02:45:25.440 --> 02:45:29.080]  that's literally what this is all about it's a whole another story and we're
[02:45:29.080 --> 02:45:33.160]  about to be cut off in about a minute or so give me a final questions just final
[02:45:33.160 --> 02:45:37.480]  comments about where you have where you go from now do you have a appeal
[02:45:37.480 --> 02:45:40.080]  process that is coming through because of all these different things that are
[02:45:40.080 --> 02:45:44.320]  going to be coming to light in about six months unfortunately we gave up our
[02:45:44.320 --> 02:45:48.200]  right to appeal when we played which is and then having done that the DOJ knew
[02:45:48.200 --> 02:45:53.000]  that they could now start violating the law over and over again so unfortunately
[02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:58.320]  no so we'll see what happens six months we what we playing now is sort of an
[02:45:58.320 --> 02:46:02.240]  information game they've had their shot at me now I get my shot at them via the
[02:46:02.240 --> 02:46:06.680]  media so we'll that will develop over the next six months and so people should
[02:46:06.680 --> 02:46:10.040]  stay tuned I suppose well so sorry that this happened to you but please keep us
[02:46:10.040 --> 02:46:14.440]  informed especially after they unseal these records that show the different
[02:46:14.440 --> 02:46:18.880]  ways that they played with the information in your trial yeah people
[02:46:18.880 --> 02:46:24.520]  can follow this at our Twitter I think they just cut them off I'll give that
[02:46:24.520 --> 02:46:29.160]  to you at his Twitter account is twitter.com forward slash free Barrett
[02:46:29.160 --> 02:46:36.720]  that's F-R-E-E-B-A-R-R-E-T-T underscore he also has on facebook.com free Barrett
[02:46:36.720 --> 02:46:41.160]  Brown and of course they disconnected it just automatically disconnects him on a
[02:46:41.160 --> 02:46:45.120]  certain amount of time again if you want to follow this on Twitter what he was
[02:46:45.120 --> 02:46:49.440]  about to give you was free Barrett underscore and then the Facebook account
[02:46:49.440 --> 02:46:57.960]  free Barrett Brown and also echelon2.org E-C-H-E-L-O-N the number two dot
[02:46:57.960 --> 02:47:05.160]  org your comment Joe like I said I mean he's a very informative man I mean he's
[02:47:05.160 --> 02:47:10.320]  a go-getter he's what a journalist is supposed to be and it's it just shows
[02:47:10.320 --> 02:47:15.200]  you the links that our government's going to go to try and silence people
[02:47:15.200 --> 02:47:18.280]  like that who are going to get out there getting the trenches dig for that
[02:47:18.280 --> 02:47:22.800]  information exposed corruption absolutely absolutely and now he's looking at
[02:47:22.800 --> 02:47:26.400]  another five years I believe or at least another if they count time served we're
[02:47:26.400 --> 02:47:29.960]  not sure about that at least another couple of years because he's given up
[02:47:29.960 --> 02:47:35.480]  his right to appeal Paul do you have a comment about that yeah I mean Barrett
[02:47:35.480 --> 02:47:41.320]  Brown is really a study in you know the threat of a good example he provided a
[02:47:41.320 --> 02:47:46.040]  link to a strat for email leak he didn't even leak the documents himself and yet
[02:47:46.040 --> 02:47:51.040]  they came down on him so hard and then I saw an interview with Obama yesterday on
[02:47:51.040 --> 02:47:55.680]  one of the Sunday shows about the Hillary Clinton email scandal and one at
[02:47:55.680 --> 02:47:59.400]  the host who was interviewing him brought up the claim that the Obama
[02:47:59.400 --> 02:48:05.280]  administration was the most transparent in history and Obama with conviction on
[02:48:05.280 --> 02:48:10.440]  his face said that's true and yet the Obama administration has been the most
[02:48:10.440 --> 02:48:16.600]  forceful in prosecuting whistleblowers across the board the most aggressive so
[02:48:16.600 --> 02:48:21.480]  the fact that this you know Barrett Brown merely provided a link to leaked
[02:48:21.480 --> 02:48:26.960]  documents and this is what's happened to him obviously is based around creating
[02:48:26.960 --> 02:48:30.800]  this chilling effect whereby other journalists of the web publishers and
[02:48:30.800 --> 02:48:36.400]  activists are afraid to even link to information which is leaked which exposes
[02:48:36.400 --> 02:48:40.640]  corruption within the administration and that's the major issue that surrounds
[02:48:40.640 --> 02:48:43.640]  this whole case I think Paul when we're looking at the fact that we've been
[02:48:43.640 --> 02:48:47.560]  talking about the Clinton emails and how we're trying to get that information
[02:48:47.560 --> 02:48:50.880]  that they were done secretly they were kept on a private server they did
[02:48:50.880 --> 02:48:55.360]  everything they could to keep that out of the public view we should remember
[02:48:55.360 --> 02:49:00.280]  that Barrett Brown and part of this project PM when they got the strat for
[02:49:00.280 --> 02:49:05.000]  leak he believed according and the judge understood from the court transcripts
[02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:09.760]  Joe that that we saw the judge understood that Barrett Brown thought that there
[02:49:09.760 --> 02:49:14.200]  was nothing but emails and what he was linking to so it'd be essentially if
[02:49:14.200 --> 02:49:18.640]  somebody were able to go in and find Hillary Clinton's illegal emails that
[02:49:18.640 --> 02:49:22.720]  she kept with a separate email address a separate server if they were to go in
[02:49:22.720 --> 02:49:27.080]  and investigate that then going after those people which is what we see isn't
[02:49:27.080 --> 02:49:30.360]  at Paul we always see the government going after the people committing the
[02:49:30.360 --> 02:49:34.400]  crime I mean people exposing the crimes are being committed and never going
[02:49:34.400 --> 02:49:38.640]  after the people who commit the crimes project PM was trying to investigate the
[02:49:38.640 --> 02:49:43.800]  actions of these private corporations like HB Gary and strat for in terms of
[02:49:43.800 --> 02:49:48.680]  targeting individuals with an anonymous targeting people who were trying to
[02:49:48.680 --> 02:49:53.680]  investigate and help people with the Bhopal Dow chemical spill and so they
[02:49:53.680 --> 02:49:56.440]  were doing this as part of a crowd sourcing investigation it'd be
[02:49:56.440 --> 02:49:59.120]  essentially if they were to do if they were to throw people in jail for trying
[02:49:59.120 --> 02:50:04.240]  to find Hillary Clinton's emails yeah I mean it's like the you know Cameron and
[02:50:04.240 --> 02:50:08.520]  Scotland Yard came out and said anybody who watches ISIS propaganda videos
[02:50:08.520 --> 02:50:13.200]  could be charged under terrorism laws completely ridiculous even though the
[02:50:13.200 --> 02:50:17.440]  fit this information is already public merely looking at it reading it or
[02:50:17.440 --> 02:50:22.440]  linking to it is now being classified as a crime or quoting someone or quote
[02:50:22.440 --> 02:50:26.440]  someone yeah using that that again we need to keep hammering that down the
[02:50:26.440 --> 02:50:31.440]  fact that they charged him with a death threat against an FBI agent when he
[02:50:31.440 --> 02:50:36.520]  merely quoted a Fox News commentator making a death threat against Julian
[02:50:36.520 --> 02:50:41.200]  Assange I mean that's the amazing thing as he pointed out the Fox News
[02:50:41.200 --> 02:50:44.880]  commentator doesn't go to jail he doesn't get in trouble but they falsely

[02:54:21.480 --> 02:54:25.800]  in this last segment talk about that call we just got from Barrett Brown in
[02:54:25.800 --> 02:54:30.600]  prison in Dallas he's gonna be serving at least another three years I guess
[02:54:30.600 --> 02:54:34.720]  perhaps more depending on how if they credit it to time serve before we go
[02:54:34.720 --> 02:54:37.240]  back to the discussion though I just want to let you know that we got a call
[02:54:37.240 --> 02:54:42.360]  from Alex he's set up an unprecedented sale on DNA Force today just a short
[02:54:42.360 --> 02:54:47.680]  period of time for the first time you can get it for under $100 that's 30% off
[02:54:47.680 --> 02:54:52.480]  competitors are already two to three times the price some charge $600 for
[02:54:52.480 --> 02:54:57.320]  similar formulas but now you can get it for 30% off for a short period of time
[02:54:57.320 --> 02:55:05.560]  that's at info wars life.com now going back to Barrett Brown Paul we talked
[02:55:05.560 --> 02:55:10.400]  about how he they brought up these charges against him for just linking to
[02:55:10.400 --> 02:55:14.280]  the information sets a terrible precedent as he pointed out in his op-ed
[02:55:14.280 --> 02:55:19.520]  piece reporters without borders cited his conviction as a key factor in
[02:55:19.520 --> 02:55:26.080]  reducing America's freedom of the press rankings from 33 to 46 it has a lot of
[02:55:26.080 --> 02:55:31.560]  precedence that we saw set in this particular case doesn't it? Well exactly
[02:55:31.560 --> 02:55:35.640]  and I mean he just talked about how the the wired writer stopped covering
[02:55:35.640 --> 02:55:40.280]  national security issues because of this case because of the fear that merely
[02:55:40.280 --> 02:55:45.000]  investigating information which is publicly available could lead to criminal
[02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:49.320]  charges for journalists so again you know it's all about making people afraid to
[02:55:49.320 --> 02:55:54.520]  investigate government and corporate corruption yes about this desperation to
[02:55:54.520 --> 02:56:01.240]  clamp down on the free internet as a viral emerging source of deep research
[02:56:01.240 --> 02:56:04.520]  and penetration into these kind of scandals that emerge out of government
[02:56:04.520 --> 02:56:08.640]  and corporation so that's why they are charging him to make an example out of
[02:56:08.640 --> 02:56:13.400]  him and like other people afraid of speaking out and of investigating this
[02:56:13.400 --> 02:56:16.760]  kind of information so it's a multi-pronged attack against the freedom of
[02:56:16.760 --> 02:56:20.400]  the press against the internet we have regulatory attacks on it and we have as
[02:56:20.400 --> 02:56:23.960]  you pointed out you know that trying to intimidate people into a kind of self
[02:56:23.960 --> 02:56:26.400]  censorship well it's kind of like there's they're putting out a warning all
[02:56:26.400 --> 02:56:29.040]  right this is what we're going to do to Barrett Brown yes you continue to do
[02:56:29.040 --> 02:56:32.280]  stuff like this we're going to prosecute you we're going to put you in prison for
[02:56:32.280 --> 02:56:36.320]  for exposing this stuff yes I said we're this this Obama administration is
[02:56:36.320 --> 02:56:40.760]  about as transparent as a brick wall I mean I mean what they're doing is out
[02:56:40.760 --> 02:56:44.960]  of control attacking journalists going after him threatening them when merely
[02:56:44.960 --> 02:56:48.960]  that's our job as journalists to expose the corruption going on transparently
[02:56:48.960 --> 02:56:52.720]  criminal they always go after the whistleblower they always go after the
[02:56:52.720 --> 02:56:56.800]  journalist never after the people who actually commit the crimes you see this
[02:56:56.800 --> 02:57:01.320]  pattern over and over and over again and again three times the number of people
[02:57:01.320 --> 02:57:06.920]  prosecuted under the espionage act of 1917 as all of the presidents combined over
[02:57:06.920 --> 02:57:10.520]  the last 100 years I mean he's after everybody whether it's the New York
[02:57:10.520 --> 02:57:15.480]  Times reporters or whether it's Barrett Brown they want people to be afraid they
[02:57:15.480 --> 02:57:19.160]  want you to know that they're watching you and they want you to know that they
[02:57:19.160 --> 02:57:24.920]  can bring in any kind of total nonsense charge and lock you away for decades I
[02:57:24.920 --> 02:57:29.520]  mean it's just mind-blowing the fact that Fox News MSNBC CNN these people will
[02:57:29.520 --> 02:57:33.280]  not cover the fact the real issues of what's going on with this case they'd
[02:57:33.280 --> 02:57:36.880]  much rather talk about the Kanye West and the things that that's the kind of
[02:57:36.880 --> 02:57:40.600]  stuff they shovel into people's faces they want to ignore the fact that he was
[02:57:40.600 --> 02:57:44.160]  you know merely quoting someone and then that she was again some of the fact
[02:57:44.160 --> 02:57:47.880]  that he has a copy of the Declaration of Independence that should that should
[02:57:47.880 --> 02:57:52.920]  arrange every American to know that they're looking at you as a criminal as
[02:57:52.920 --> 02:57:56.560]  a terrorist for having something like that for being patriotic for being
[02:57:56.560 --> 02:58:00.840]  informed for knowing your rights that is something they want to go after a total
[02:58:00.840 --> 02:58:03.920]  blackout for the mainstream media what do you make of that Paul that the fact
[02:58:03.920 --> 02:58:08.680]  that they would confiscate his Declaration of Independence that would be
[02:58:08.680 --> 02:58:12.720]  part of the plea agreement and then they would say well I think we can give him
[02:58:12.720 --> 02:58:15.920]  that plea agreement back we're almost out of time real quick comment well I
[02:58:15.920 --> 02:58:19.920]  mean they did a similar thing to Aaron Schwartz I mean he was he had similar
[02:58:19.920 --> 02:58:23.920]  material and they use that against him so it's no surprise that you know they
[02:58:23.920 --> 02:58:27.640]  would they would use that as a reason to go after him absolutely and that's the
[02:58:27.640 --> 02:58:31.040]  only book they take yeah absolutely well that's it for today thanks for
