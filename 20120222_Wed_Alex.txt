[00:00.000 --> 00:08.260]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[00:08.260 --> 00:11.300]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[00:11.300 --> 00:14.940]  Okay, here we are folks coming up.
[00:14.940 --> 00:17.660]  We'll get into the TSA says you're a terrorist.
[00:17.660 --> 00:23.780]  If you don't like them groping you, we're gonna get into the attacks on Ron Paul and
[00:23.780 --> 00:26.460]  how they've been censoring him and engaged in fraud.
[00:26.460 --> 00:28.500]  They've been caught, engaged in election fraud.
[00:28.500 --> 00:35.140]  I wanted to jam in just a few calls here with Gerald Salente, but first off, Gerald, what
[00:35.140 --> 00:39.140]  are some of the newest trend alerts you're putting out at trendsresearch.com?
[00:39.140 --> 00:44.900]  Well, of course, the one on how to end the Iran conflict by going with thorium.
[00:44.900 --> 00:49.620]  But right now we're really focused on what's going on with gold prices.
[00:49.620 --> 00:51.620]  There's no been no Greek bailout.
[00:51.620 --> 00:52.620]  That's a lot of baloney.
[00:52.620 --> 00:54.620]  They just took on more debt.
[00:54.620 --> 00:56.660]  Watch this very closely.
[00:56.660 --> 01:00.940]  It passed a rhetoric over there about, you know, the Greeks don't like to work and all
[01:00.940 --> 01:02.660]  this kind of baloney.
[01:02.660 --> 01:07.740]  What's happening is again, the first great war of the 21st century has begun.
[01:07.740 --> 01:11.340]  We're very concerned about what's going on in Iran.
[01:11.340 --> 01:13.340]  Watch oil prices.
[01:13.340 --> 01:18.060]  And again, I'm saying this only speaking for myself.
[01:18.060 --> 01:26.020]  I really caution people to watch what's going on in the sense that if there's some kind
[01:26.020 --> 01:31.180]  of a conflict, whether it's false flag or real, and they're setting us up for it with
[01:31.180 --> 01:38.860]  Iran, I firmly believe that they will either close Wall Street like they did when 9-11
[01:38.860 --> 01:42.500]  happened, or they will call a bank holiday.
[01:42.500 --> 01:48.660]  And if you have your money in certificates of deposit and they close down Wall Street,
[01:48.660 --> 01:50.620]  you don't get anything.
[01:50.620 --> 01:56.780]  And I also believe they're going to use this, as I said, when all else fails, they get you
[01:56.780 --> 01:58.300]  into war.
[01:58.300 --> 02:03.420]  And that's going to be continued devaluation of the dollar.
[02:03.420 --> 02:10.940]  And when you look at what corn, what wheat, and what soybeans have done over the last
[02:10.940 --> 02:14.460]  year, they're on an average of over 50 percent.
[02:14.460 --> 02:23.940]  When you look at Midwest farmland, it's gone up 25 percent in the last year as the real
[02:23.940 --> 02:26.620]  estate market is diving.
[02:26.620 --> 02:28.060]  Put it together.
[02:28.060 --> 02:32.300]  It's the devaluation of the currency.
[02:32.300 --> 02:34.940]  So I'm just telling people, be prepared.
[02:34.940 --> 02:36.780]  Well, they're not saying.
[02:36.780 --> 02:37.780]  It's coming.
[02:37.780 --> 02:38.780]  Exactly.
[02:38.780 --> 02:44.420]  Gerald, just what you said, they're now telling the Greeks, get ready for a bank holiday
[02:44.420 --> 02:48.460]  like you say, this is another type of holiday you want to go on, let's jam in one call for
[02:48.460 --> 02:49.460]  you here.
[02:49.460 --> 02:52.900]  Mike in California, you're on the air with the one, the only Gerald Salente.
[02:52.900 --> 02:57.140]  Hey, Gerald, Gerald, definitely you said some important things that need to be said.
[02:57.140 --> 02:59.100]  I'm glad that you said them.
[02:59.100 --> 03:07.140]  My question for you is I'm calling from home for the Ron Paul campaign, but with the discouragement
[03:07.140 --> 03:14.380]  of the voter fraud at the delegate level, what is your opinion about those that we
[03:14.380 --> 03:18.220]  would support Ron Paul for candidacy of president?
[03:18.220 --> 03:22.620]  What are the next action steps that we need to take that we need to go to the civic centers
[03:22.620 --> 03:23.620]  peacefully?
[03:23.620 --> 03:24.620]  Yeah.
[03:24.620 --> 03:30.580]  We pressure Ron Paul in a third party once the fraud is unavoidable that there's a defrauding
[03:30.580 --> 03:31.580]  him.
[03:31.580 --> 03:33.100]  What's your final comments on that, Gerald?
[03:33.100 --> 03:37.620]  I would absolutely go for a third party.
[03:37.620 --> 03:43.220]  A Ron Paul in a counterbounce, I'll tell you what I would think, for example, the kind
[03:43.220 --> 03:48.660]  of Ron Paul ticket, if it doesn't work here, would be someone like a Ralph Nader on the
[03:48.660 --> 03:54.820]  other side, not necessarily Ralph Nader, I call it progressive libertarian, the both
[03:54.820 --> 03:55.820]  of the best rules.
[03:55.820 --> 04:00.180]  But a unification ticket to bring everybody together, but exactly, if the Republicans
[04:00.180 --> 04:04.460]  have demonized him, cheated him, and are doing this, he doesn't owe it to the Republican
[04:04.460 --> 04:07.900]  party or even Rand as a senator.
[04:07.900 --> 04:14.080]  You know, Alex, politics has become like a religion, like a fundamentalist religion.
[04:14.080 --> 04:19.740]  If you don't believe in Republicans or Democrats, you have no place here.
[04:19.740 --> 04:25.260]  And these politicians, when I talk about a fundamentalist religion, and me being a political
[04:25.260 --> 04:28.140]  atheist, I don't believe in their pope.
[04:28.140 --> 04:29.380]  And guess what?
[04:29.380 --> 04:34.940]  These senators are nothing more than phony little cardinals, and these congressmen are
[04:34.940 --> 04:38.540]  nothing more than little bishops.
[04:38.540 --> 04:39.540]  You're right.
[04:39.540 --> 04:40.540]  Incredible.
[04:40.540 --> 04:41.540]  Gerald, we're out of time.
[04:41.540 --> 04:42.540]  Thank you so much.
[04:42.540 --> 04:43.540]  Thank you so much, Gerald.
[04:43.540 --> 04:44.540]  I look forward to having you back up the stage.
[04:44.540 --> 04:45.540]  Thank you.
[04:45.540 --> 04:46.540]  We'll be back tonight, 7 o'clock, info wars, nightly news.
[04:46.540 --> 04:47.540]  I'll be following more reports at infowars.com.
[04:47.540 --> 04:48.540]  Watch this space.
[04:48.540 --> 04:49.540]  Great job to the crew.
[04:49.540 --> 04:50.540]  Got all of you out there.
[04:50.540 --> 04:51.540]  More will, and we'll see you back tomorrow, 11 a.m. on the radio.
[04:51.540 --> 04:52.540]  More coming up after this.
[04:52.540 --> 05:06.740]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even if I had a
[05:06.740 --> 05:09.220]  pretty good-sized meal that I was still starving.
[05:09.220 --> 05:14.020]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops
[05:14.020 --> 05:18.180]  on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[05:18.180 --> 05:23.780]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to
[05:23.780 --> 05:26.940]  rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[05:26.940 --> 05:33.260]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity.
[05:33.260 --> 05:37.420]  The Young Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need.
[05:37.420 --> 05:41.260]  And once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.

[05:47.820 --> 05:48.820]  Check it out for yourself.
[05:48.820 --> 05:49.820]  It's incredible.

[06:02.060 --> 06:05.100]  I've been telling you about eFoodsDirect for a while now.
[06:05.100 --> 06:08.860]  Here are my top 10 reasons to stock up on food from eFoodsDirect.
[06:08.860 --> 06:11.900]  Number 10, the food I get from eFoodsDirect tastes great.
[06:11.900 --> 06:14.700]  Number 9, the eFoods meals are easy to prepare.
[06:14.700 --> 06:18.020]  Eight, eFoodsDirect delivers the food right to my front door.
[06:18.020 --> 06:21.020]  Seven, most of these meals cost less than $2.
[06:21.020 --> 06:24.140]  Six, with their large variety, I can eat it every day.
[06:24.140 --> 06:28.100]  Five, I always have access to high quality and delicious food.
[06:28.100 --> 06:32.100]  Number four, eFoods products don't spoil, so I never waste any food.
[06:32.100 --> 06:35.540]  Three, eFoods uses only safe, healthy ingredients.
[06:35.540 --> 06:39.780]  Number two, I have my own food supply and don't depend on the grocery store.
[06:39.780 --> 06:46.100]  And the number one reason I promote eFoodsDirect is they build special offers just for my listeners.
[06:46.100 --> 06:50.220]  Folks don't wait, get prepared now, we all need to be self-sufficient.
[06:50.220 --> 06:55.300]  Call eFoodsDirect at 800-409-5633 and ask for the Alex Jones special.
[06:55.300 --> 07:01.580]  Call eFoodsDirect at 800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[07:01.580 --> 07:06.220]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[07:06.220 --> 07:10.580]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[07:10.580 --> 07:14.900]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[07:14.900 --> 07:16.180]  allows you to have.
[07:16.180 --> 07:21.900]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[07:21.900 --> 07:26.220]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[07:26.220 --> 07:30.260]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[07:30.260 --> 07:33.740]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[07:33.740 --> 07:37.420]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[07:37.420 --> 07:42.180]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[07:42.180 --> 07:45.980]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[07:45.980 --> 07:47.340]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[07:47.340 --> 07:51.580]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[08:15.220 --> 08:21.460]  Welcome my friends, fellow info warriors, seekers of liberty and freedom worldwide.
[08:21.460 --> 08:29.180]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, and it is Wednesday, February 22nd, 2012, and we're going to be
[08:29.180 --> 08:33.300]  live here for the next three hours at least.
[08:33.300 --> 08:38.780]  Eric Muller, known as Man Cow, syndicated radio host, is scheduled to join us coming
[08:38.780 --> 08:41.580]  up later in the second half of this hour.
[08:41.580 --> 08:46.660]  I've talked to him privately and off the record when he came to Austin a few weeks ago and
[08:46.660 --> 08:52.780]  tried to twist his arm into going on air and telling on air the stories he's told me about
[08:52.780 --> 08:58.980]  being in TV and radio newsrooms around the country four years ago and again this year
[08:58.980 --> 09:06.740]  and last year, so the last two campaigns and witnessing news executives in TV and radio
[09:06.740 --> 09:12.780]  ordering people not to announce Ron Paul as the winner of polls, straw polls, or when
[09:12.780 --> 09:18.900]  he's in first or second place, not to even mention him in a primary or caucus.
[09:18.900 --> 09:25.940]  And of course, you know, Man Cow has worked at the national TV networks like Fox, he has
[09:25.940 --> 09:31.460]  worked in syndicated radio, he's on over 100 radio stations right now, a lot of them that
[09:31.460 --> 09:41.500]  I'm on like big eight and driving out to visit, we're going to be speaking this Sunday, we're
[09:41.500 --> 09:46.820]  both number one there in Orlando, but the point is that Man Cow is going to come on because
[09:46.820 --> 09:50.540]  I was on his show this morning and without me prompting him, he's sort of going ahead
[09:50.540 --> 09:51.540]  and talking about it.
[09:51.540 --> 09:57.900]  I guess he couldn't shut up about it anymore and so I'm going to see how far he'll go on
[09:57.900 --> 10:04.820]  air with us coming up here in about 23 minutes from now, I'm going to call him via his cell,
[10:04.820 --> 10:07.860]  he just got off his own radio show.
[10:07.860 --> 10:10.780]  In fact, we're going to try to twist his arm and get him to go back into his studio and
[10:10.780 --> 10:16.380]  maybe even do it via ISVN line, which he has, but he always wants to do it on a cell phone
[10:16.380 --> 10:19.620]  I guess so he can leave his office.
[10:19.620 --> 10:24.380]  What prompted me to really start getting into the Ron Paul being defrauded and hence the
[10:24.380 --> 10:34.460]  American people being defrauded is the fact that we saw election fraud in Iowa, which
[10:34.460 --> 10:39.580]  has now been confirmed, and we saw election fraud in Nevada, which has been confirmed
[10:39.580 --> 10:44.660]  and South Carolina that's been confirmed and Maine completely confirmed.
[10:44.660 --> 10:49.580]  They've admitted, okay, most of these counties that Ron Paul was leading in in some places
[10:49.580 --> 10:55.260]  double digits, we didn't count them and the precinct heads, the county heads are on record
[10:55.260 --> 11:00.660]  saying we tried to call in the results and we were told, oh, we've already got those,
[11:00.660 --> 11:02.220]  it's for Mitt Romney.
[11:02.220 --> 11:06.660]  I mean, this is on record in all the big Maine newspapers, this is the head of the Maine
[11:06.660 --> 11:13.020]  Republican Party saying this, and so now they're telling a whole bunch of counties, including
[11:13.020 --> 11:18.100]  very populous ones, this is weeks after the Maine primary, you still don't get to count
[11:18.100 --> 11:23.340]  them, sit down and shut up, they go to Mitt Romney, and they're like, but we did count
[11:23.340 --> 11:27.780]  it was Ron Paul or you, you, people showed up and they wouldn't let them vote saying
[11:27.780 --> 11:28.780]  it's been canceled.
[11:28.780 --> 11:33.100]  They said it was a snowstorm, it was supposed to be three inches, it wasn't even a half
[11:33.100 --> 11:38.260]  inch, it wasn't even a sprinkling, and there were still Girl Scout meetings that day, and
[11:38.260 --> 11:44.900]  this is all broken down at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com, Ron Paul is being cheated
[11:44.900 --> 11:47.140]  out of the Republican nomination.
[11:47.140 --> 11:53.420]  Now I covered this back a few months ago, a day after the Iowa caucuses, we were able
[11:53.420 --> 11:58.300]  to have witness after witness who were there, some of even precinct heads where they would
[11:58.300 --> 12:02.940]  call in their number and then see something else on the news that night, or they would
[12:02.940 --> 12:08.620]  say on the news, trucks have been lost with the ballots on board, so all these key counties
[12:08.620 --> 12:12.420]  with all these key precincts, they're not reporting, but there was a closed door meeting
[12:12.420 --> 12:18.100]  between Mitt Romney and Santorum, and they decided that it would be, you know, Santorum
[12:18.100 --> 12:21.980]  moved up from third place to second place, and Ron Paul third, and of course who said
[12:21.980 --> 12:26.300]  that Carl Rove on Fox News, well there's a problem, there are no trucks with ballots
[12:26.300 --> 12:27.940]  in Iowa.
[12:27.940 --> 12:32.460]  You have people go in, they vote publicly, they raise their hands, the numbers are readout,
[12:32.460 --> 12:35.460]  it's posted on the wall, the phone call is made.
[12:35.460 --> 12:40.660]  That's why Ron Paul was set to win Iowa, he was number one in every major poll, every
[12:40.660 --> 12:45.020]  major poll until a day before, and then they turned saying in a few polls, well he's second
[12:45.020 --> 12:50.100]  place now, and then it comes in third, the point is winning all the straw polls, only
[12:50.100 --> 12:54.780]  his bumper stickers nationwide, his videos get the most views, you know, a video I shot
[12:54.780 --> 13:01.380]  last night had a couple thousand likes in just a few hours on it, and maybe 10 or so
[13:01.380 --> 13:06.340]  dislikes on it, I mean just another example, all over the country I go, all I see is Ron
[13:06.340 --> 13:10.900]  Paul stickers, never a Mitt Romney, never a Santorum, even in Texas I think I've seen
[13:10.900 --> 13:18.220]  one Rick Perry for governor back when he was running, this is what I am seeing everywhere,
[13:18.220 --> 13:23.900]  this is what I'm seeing across the board, and this is what you're seeing, but people
[13:23.900 --> 13:27.100]  say oh that's circumstantial that you only see Ron Paul stickers, there are only Ron
[13:27.100 --> 13:32.780]  Paul signs across the country everywhere I go, from Arkansas to California to New York
[13:32.780 --> 13:37.940]  to Louisiana to South Texas, and you're seeing the same thing across the country, you only
[13:37.940 --> 13:42.740]  see Ron Paul, and all the cheating him on the previous polls he's won, they just won't
[13:42.740 --> 13:46.540]  report he's won, or he gets second place, they just only report first and third and
[13:46.540 --> 13:53.860]  fourth place, I listen to the so-called conservative talk radio news, like IRN that Genesis carries,
[13:53.860 --> 13:57.980]  even when Ron Paul wins they don't say he wins, they'll mention the second and third
[13:57.980 --> 14:05.380]  place, I mean this is the type of stuff we're all witnessing, the fix is in, but in Maine
[14:05.380 --> 14:10.140]  it's bonafide, at first 4% are reporting, they're saying well it looks like Romney's
[14:10.140 --> 14:17.860]  going to be the winner, and then days after when 80% reported, they said well it looks
[14:17.860 --> 14:22.460]  like Mitt Romney wins without even counting the counties that went for Ron Paul, and now
[14:22.460 --> 14:26.460]  Ron Paul's saying we're challenging this, count the counties, and the state's saying
[14:26.460 --> 14:31.540]  no we don't think we'll do that, Nevada was the same story, he was first place in most
[14:31.540 --> 14:36.540]  the polls when he came in third place, it's the same story over and over and over again,
[14:36.540 --> 14:42.220]  they've pulled out all the stops, the entire system attacking him, listeners mail me newspaper
[14:42.220 --> 14:49.060]  articles from New Mexico, other states where it shows Ron Paul in a clan outfit, and people
[14:49.060 --> 14:54.100]  looking at Newt Genrich saying well Republicans don't like you, you're too extreme, they like
[14:54.100 --> 15:00.420]  him implying that Republicans are clan members, and that Ron Paul's the chief clan leader,
[15:00.420 --> 15:06.260]  this is the type of all out panic that we've seen from the system, so if you want to see
[15:06.260 --> 15:11.940]  the proof, and by the way Paul's article just goes off mainstream reports, it's actually
[15:11.940 --> 15:17.780]  moderate, and of course extremism and defensive liberty is no vice, it's actually worse than
[15:17.780 --> 15:22.940]  Paul Watson put together, I worked with him this morning on some of the points, I wanted
[15:22.940 --> 15:28.380]  he's got my video I shot from the road last night posted in the article, and that video
[15:28.380 --> 15:32.780]  doesn't even get into the fact that you see a hundred to one Ron Paul stickers, a hundred
[15:32.780 --> 15:37.500]  to one Ron Paul signs, and when I say a hundred to one, I've never seen a Mitt Romney Newt
[15:37.500 --> 15:45.500]  Genrich or Santorum or Michelle Bachman sign, I've never seen one, I have seen one Rick
[15:45.500 --> 15:54.060]  Perry, that's all I've ever seen, I've only seen one Rick Perry months ago before he dropped
[15:54.060 --> 15:58.260]  out in Austin Texas where you'd expect you'd see some, he is the governor is the capital
[15:58.260 --> 16:06.580]  city, I've never seen any of it, I do see maybe one twentieth or so the Obama stickers
[16:06.580 --> 16:12.500]  I saw four years ago or three years ago, but I do see some Obama 2012 stickers, in fact
[16:12.500 --> 16:16.100]  I see one probably every day, there are a lot of those compared to the others, I mean
[16:16.100 --> 16:23.900]  they don't exist, and you're all seeing this, I'm seeing this, so savor this painful event
[16:23.900 --> 16:29.540]  and realize this is how much trouble we're in, because only by admitting how monumental
[16:29.540 --> 16:44.860]  this gargantuan colossal mammoth galactic sized fraud, this mega fraud, this Googleplex
[16:44.860 --> 16:53.980]  fraud, it is so big, it is so in our face that it makes my head spin, and then I put
[16:53.980 --> 16:57.860]  out a video last night on the road saying, you know we've broken this town, the previous
[16:57.860 --> 17:01.620]  frauds on the nightliness and on my radio show, but I'm going to work with the crew
[17:01.620 --> 17:07.780]  from the road or when I get back on a compilation of the fraud, and I see the minority of people
[17:07.780 --> 17:13.820]  in thousands of likes, last time I checked, less than ten or so dislikes, so we're talking
[17:13.820 --> 17:19.380]  about ninety five plus percent, I don't know guys with a calculator do the math, if you
[17:19.380 --> 17:24.220]  have let's just say two thousand likes on the video, I spent up a few hours you know
[17:24.220 --> 17:30.220]  it has twenty thousand views or whatever, last night, last time I looked at it, so something
[17:30.220 --> 17:35.940]  has twenty thousand views, a couple thousand likes, and ten dislikes, what's that ratio?
[17:35.940 --> 17:40.740]  Ten out of two thousand, or to be technical it was like ten out of one thousand nine hundred
[17:40.740 --> 17:49.020]  something, so do the math, what is ten dislikes of my video out of one thousand nine hundred
[17:49.020 --> 17:55.260]  likes, it's ninety something percent, but again people say oh that's just his fans,
[17:55.260 --> 18:00.020]  they're just energetic, that was the case four years ago, he could have been a front
[18:00.020 --> 18:03.500]  runner but they demonized him, shut him out, it looked like he was going to win in New
[18:03.500 --> 18:07.700]  Hampshire, there was some fraud there so he couldn't become a front runner, but this time
[18:07.700 --> 18:14.340]  you're seeing a front and center big time colossal level fraud, and again there was
[18:14.340 --> 18:19.780]  fraud in South Carolina, go look it up, it's admitted, Iowa, they've thrown out the election
[18:19.780 --> 18:24.740]  and said well now we're seeing Santorum won but we don't know what we'll do, we'll put
[18:24.740 --> 18:30.340]  it all again, and there's no discussion, it's not a national news story, it's just
[18:30.340 --> 18:37.940]  in Iowa papers, Maine, I mean Paul has, Watson has links here to mainstream news, well here's
[18:37.940 --> 18:41.300]  the New York Times, Ron Paul might have won Maine, you know that's one of the links,
[18:41.300 --> 18:45.620]  it links to local papers and groups saying yeah they didn't count all these counties
[18:45.620 --> 18:51.020]  and it just so happens just like in Iowa, just like in Nevada, just like in South Carolina,
[18:51.020 --> 18:57.100]  in Maine it's all the places that he was dominating, it's all the places where he had in some
[18:57.100 --> 19:02.300]  cases double digit leads, so it is being stolen, how would that have worked for the system
[19:02.300 --> 19:07.300]  when they told you you can't have him, he can't win, he's a cook, he's dangerous, you're
[19:07.300 --> 19:12.020]  dangerous, people like Alex Jones are dangerous, Ron Paul's dangerous because he goes on his
[19:12.020 --> 19:17.300]  show, you can't have him, and then imagine if they would have let him win those, boom,
[19:17.300 --> 19:23.580]  he'd be the presumptive nominee, boom, he gets in the ring with Obama, boom, it's over,
[19:23.580 --> 19:28.220]  all the major Gallup polls, he beats Obama better than any other Republican, boom, he's
[19:28.220 --> 19:34.580]  president, boom, starts abolishing the Federal Reserve, boom, even if they assassinate him,
[19:34.580 --> 19:38.660]  now people understand what happened, he becomes a martyr, not saying I want that to happen
[19:38.660 --> 19:41.060]  but that's what happened and they did kill him.
[19:41.060 --> 19:46.060]  Now the globalists are in real trouble, and again Ron Paul is only the fruit of the awakening,
[19:46.060 --> 19:50.820]  he's only the manifestation, a focal point, as we've always said, and whether he wins
[19:50.820 --> 19:57.540]  loses or draws by being in the arena, he educates people and raises the awareness.
[19:57.540 --> 20:01.340]  So I'm going to continue breaking down Paul Watson's article that's so important that
[20:01.340 --> 20:30.660]  it has my video in it.
[20:30.660 --> 20:34.500]  We are in an information war and we are losing that war.
[20:34.500 --> 20:41.380]  The globalists are scared, they've overreached, the future of the info war is in your hands.

[20:54.380 --> 20:58.700]  globalist propaganda platform, we are going to use their system against them.
[20:58.700 --> 21:01.820]  The info war now goes into high gear.

[21:31.460 --> 21:35.660]  We the people grow cotton, wheat fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from
[21:35.660 --> 21:39.900]  counterfeit and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes
[21:39.900 --> 21:40.900]  to serve as debt.
[21:40.900 --> 21:44.420]  This capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing to public
[21:44.420 --> 21:47.700]  currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army.
[21:47.700 --> 21:52.020]  Hi, Ted Anderson, I'm placing a silver dollar in a book, explains our monetary system.
[21:52.020 --> 21:55.260]  Call for your copy, 800-686-2237.
[21:55.260 --> 21:56.700]  It's time to understand the system.
[21:56.700 --> 22:01.580]  Call 800-686-2237, that's 800-686-2237.
[22:01.580 --> 22:06.860]  2012 is finally here, and while the government racks up another $1 trillion in debt, the
[22:06.860 --> 22:09.700]  IRS is hard at work collecting.
[22:09.700 --> 22:14.200]  In fact, they're even sending agents to some people's homes in place of business.
[22:14.200 --> 22:19.100]  If you owe back taxes, have years of unfiled tax returns, or are receiving threatening letters
[22:19.100 --> 22:27.260]  or phone calls, call the tax division of the law offices of Craig Zimmerman at 800-652-6978.
[22:27.260 --> 22:32.980]  Our tax division is spearheaded by a former IRS agent with over 31 years experience.
[22:32.980 --> 22:37.740]  He knows the ins and outs of the IRS and how to get them off your back once and for all.
[22:37.740 --> 22:48.820]  The phone call is free, and so is the consultation, so call now 800-652-6978, that's 800-652-6978.
[22:48.820 --> 22:55.980]  Good wait for agents to knock on your door, call 800-652-6978, or visit us on the web
[22:55.980 --> 22:59.820]  at www.CraigZLaw.com.
[22:59.820 --> 23:01.740]  You'll be glad you did.
[23:01.740 --> 23:03.860]  What is the most abundant resource on earth?
[23:03.860 --> 23:04.860]  Water.
[23:04.860 --> 23:08.060]  It's essential for sustaining life, but it's not always the most available.
[23:08.060 --> 23:11.380]  When disaster strikes, water quickly vanishes from store shelves.
[23:11.380 --> 23:16.020]  Like it did during 9-11, Katrina, Japan, and in Joplin, three days without water and your
[23:16.020 --> 23:17.660]  body begins to shut down.
[23:17.660 --> 23:21.500]  No risk being without an abundant supply of water when the next disaster hits.
[23:21.500 --> 23:22.980]  Get a Flowjack hand well pump.

[23:32.140 --> 23:35.660]  You could risk your family's health on a limited supply of stored water, or you could
[23:35.660 --> 23:39.620]  be prepared with the reliable, affordable Flowjack back-up hand pump kit.
[23:39.620 --> 23:42.420]  Deliver to your door for only $3.99 complete.

[23:44.500 --> 23:47.420]  Spelled F-L-O-J-A-K dot com.

[23:53.340 --> 23:58.500]  That's 855-435-6525, proudly made in America.
[23:58.500 --> 24:09.100]  Flowjack hand well pumps, peace of mind in a box.
[24:09.100 --> 24:14.420]  This is not America.
[24:14.420 --> 24:18.900]  A little piece of me, a little piece of you.
[24:18.900 --> 24:23.900]  We die for the system.
[24:23.900 --> 24:32.660]  I mean, what does this mean for our country that we saw classic election fraud on record
[24:32.660 --> 24:39.420]  by Kennedy in Illinois, West Virginia and other states, confirmed cases in Texas by
[24:39.420 --> 24:43.060]  LBJ to get into office in Congress, famous cases.
[24:43.060 --> 24:46.260]  I'm no fan of Ron Paul, but it came out in court and I looked at it.
[24:46.260 --> 24:50.180]  There was election fraud in 2000 against Al Gore.
[24:50.180 --> 24:54.620]  There was election fraud in 2004, but that didn't matter because there was election
[24:54.620 --> 24:58.980]  fraud by his fraternity mate, secret society mate.
[24:58.980 --> 25:02.980]  Only 15 members a year that happened to be the one guy he was running against from a
[25:02.980 --> 25:06.540]  later class was John Kerry.
[25:06.540 --> 25:13.940]  So he didn't contest anything when that fraud in Ohio and other places came out.
[25:13.940 --> 25:19.620]  And it was later totally certified in court and they had engineers go public for major
[25:19.620 --> 25:23.020]  companies and people getting killed and being hung.
[25:23.020 --> 25:25.980]  I mean, that's always the evidence of the crime.
[25:25.980 --> 25:29.820]  It's not like with Oklahoma City, I just get on air and have police officers on like
[25:29.820 --> 25:35.540]  Sergeant Browning, the head of the K9 unit who saw the bombs and the feds and everything
[25:35.540 --> 25:38.020]  in the building and Oklahoma City.
[25:38.020 --> 25:42.420]  And then the FBI agents come to his office in one case and while he's walking down the
[25:42.420 --> 25:47.100]  hall and say, you and your wife are going to die if you keep looking into who else was
[25:47.100 --> 25:54.020]  involved in this bombing, boy, it's not like they, they were just threatening him.
[25:54.020 --> 25:57.900]  You know, they did kill Terrence Yakey, cop of the year who saved a bunch of people in
[25:57.900 --> 26:01.300]  the building.
[26:01.300 --> 26:05.340]  He was there a minute after it happened and saw the ATF and full bomb gear running around
[26:05.340 --> 26:06.980]  telling medics to patch them up.
[26:06.980 --> 26:10.860]  They've been on the ninth floor and he's like, ninth floor, the ninth floor is blown out,
[26:10.860 --> 26:11.860]  the elevators are down.
[26:11.860 --> 26:13.740]  Why are you guys here?
[26:13.740 --> 26:15.860]  Why are you all ready?
[26:15.860 --> 26:19.100]  What why is the head of the FBI any terrorism unit already here?
[26:19.100 --> 26:21.140]  They just said, how about we just kill you?
[26:21.140 --> 26:26.420]  Oh yeah, they'll, they'll, they'll commit Oklahoma City.
[26:26.420 --> 26:29.740]  They'll kill different people involved that have exposed election fraud.
[26:29.740 --> 26:31.300]  Got to look into that.
[26:31.300 --> 26:32.460]  But there's nothing going on.
[26:32.460 --> 26:33.960]  They'll lie about WMDs.
[26:33.960 --> 26:38.700]  They'll have drones attacking countries where they don't even have jurisdiction or a declaration
[26:38.700 --> 26:40.500]  of war and killing people.
[26:40.500 --> 26:43.500]  They'll say that it's, it's okay to kill 200 people.
[26:43.500 --> 26:47.820]  They've said it's good collateral damage to kill one guy they say is a bad guy in Pakistan
[26:47.820 --> 26:49.580]  or Afghanistan.
[26:49.580 --> 26:53.900]  But they wouldn't ever steal an election, kind of like George Bush said five years ago.
[26:53.900 --> 26:58.940]  I promise, I remember from the stage in a press conference, we're not listening to you
[26:58.940 --> 27:02.660]  without, let me put on my fake Texas accent because I'm Kenny Bugport, Maine.
[27:02.660 --> 27:06.020]  Not the wrong folks from Maine, but you know, I like to act like I'm a tough, tough Texan.
[27:06.020 --> 27:07.740]  Let me, let me put on one of those little acts.
[27:07.740 --> 27:09.940]  I like cowboy movies when I was a kid.
[27:09.940 --> 27:10.940]  Uh, yeah.
[27:10.940 --> 27:14.180]  Uh, no, we don't listen to Americans without warrants.
[27:14.180 --> 27:15.180]  That's illegal.
[27:15.180 --> 27:16.180]  We only listen to Al Qaeda.
[27:16.180 --> 27:19.740]  Then it came out a year later, they were listening to everything without warrants.
[27:19.740 --> 27:24.860]  In fact, I wrote a list here of all, just some of their frauds, but, but now we're supposed
[27:24.860 --> 27:25.860]  to believe them.
[27:25.860 --> 27:30.460]  They even caught dealing drugs, our government, the big banks that control it and laundering
[27:30.460 --> 27:33.060]  hundreds of billions of drug money a year.
[27:33.060 --> 27:40.980]  They've been caught lying to start wars, WMD, they've been caught doing medical experiments
[27:40.980 --> 27:41.980]  thousands of times.
[27:41.980 --> 27:46.180]  New ones just got declassified this week, shooting black people up when they come in
[27:46.180 --> 27:53.820]  from car wrecks at hospitals, uh, with plutonium and then, and then dissecting them while they
[27:53.820 --> 27:58.140]  were alive and only one guy escaped and then later died of heart failure, kind of like
[27:58.140 --> 28:00.220]  the kids around Fukushima just died of heart failure.
[28:00.220 --> 28:02.820]  That's what the plutonium and uranium finally does.
[28:02.820 --> 28:06.900]  There's a big article on info wars.com with links and you notice it's, it's black people,
[28:06.900 --> 28:12.220]  black people about half the time, but they, they killed white people too, but they just
[28:12.220 --> 28:15.340]  learned that blacks didn't have as much political power.
[28:15.340 --> 28:16.980]  People didn't end up listening to them.
[28:16.980 --> 28:21.820]  They didn't have as much money on average in the 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s and they still grab
[28:21.820 --> 28:24.140]  black people about half the time.
[28:24.140 --> 28:26.700]  Black folks are like the dish disjure.
[28:26.700 --> 28:32.580]  Oh, New York, five years ago, New York Daily News, I report on it, you can pull it up.
[28:32.580 --> 28:38.460]  They would grab little black kids and test pesticides on them till they die.
[28:38.460 --> 28:41.700]  And uh, in fact it was one case where they told the mother, we're going to take your
[28:41.700 --> 28:45.420]  two year old unless you sign these forms, wear the CPS and let us have the eight year
[28:45.420 --> 28:46.420]  old.
[28:46.420 --> 28:50.260]  And they took him in for two months, tested pesticides on him and tied him down.
[28:50.260 --> 28:51.900]  He tried to escape till he died.
[28:51.900 --> 28:57.100]  In his latest article, the one black guy to escape, they pulled most of his teeth out,
[28:57.100 --> 29:02.740]  15 teeth out to test what it was doing and had cut into him and were taking bone biopsies
[29:02.740 --> 29:08.460]  uh, in his leg because that's where he broken it in the car wrecks.
[29:08.460 --> 29:13.220]  They knew that they could get in there and he had to crawl out at night and escape from
[29:13.220 --> 29:18.020]  them and did a police report and stuff, but then died a few years later of heart failure
[29:18.020 --> 29:19.020]  from the radiation.
[29:19.020 --> 29:24.340]  That's, that's just one guy that escaped, that escaped from the eugenicist clutches,
[29:24.340 --> 29:27.420]  but they wouldn't engage in election fraud.
[29:27.420 --> 29:31.940]  No, they just announced 12 years ago that when the veterans died, they're stealing their
[29:31.940 --> 29:32.940]  death benefits.
[29:32.940 --> 29:35.820]  That's Bloomberg AP.
[29:35.820 --> 29:41.300]  The open insider trading by government openly against everybody and then Congress says it's
[29:41.300 --> 29:42.820]  legal and it's not.
[29:42.820 --> 29:48.740]  Yes, they've stolen elections in the past, but, but not now, not now, just don't believe
[29:48.740 --> 29:51.540]  your lion eyes, believe that Mitt Romney loves you.
[29:51.540 --> 29:55.140]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[29:55.140 --> 29:58.740]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[29:58.740 --> 30:07.900]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[30:07.900 --> 30:12.580]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly
[30:12.580 --> 30:16.740]  into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[30:16.740 --> 30:20.980]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[30:20.980 --> 30:26.620]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver
[30:26.620 --> 30:33.500]  solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream with continued
[30:33.500 --> 30:36.900]  legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products.
[30:36.900 --> 30:42.500]  You can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[30:42.500 --> 30:47.780]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[30:47.780 --> 30:54.020]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver
[30:54.020 --> 30:55.020]  Lungs Generator.
[30:55.020 --> 30:56.020]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[30:56.020 --> 31:06.180]  I had tried everything, I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating, I was lifting
[31:06.180 --> 31:08.820]  weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[31:08.820 --> 31:13.300]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[31:13.300 --> 31:19.060]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously
[31:19.060 --> 31:20.560]  and be satisfied.
[31:20.560 --> 31:24.540]  Now there are hundreds of great products at InfowarsTeam.com, but I want to point out
[31:24.540 --> 31:32.140]  the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[31:32.140 --> 31:36.980]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst and Rebound, when I started taking the
[31:36.980 --> 31:42.500]  Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[31:42.500 --> 31:43.940]  Now that's results.
[31:43.940 --> 31:49.700]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to InfowarsTeam.com and to order just three of
[31:49.700 --> 31:50.700]  their products.
[31:50.700 --> 31:56.780]  And you will see the changes in the way you look, feel and in your appetite almost immediately.
[31:56.780 --> 32:00.820]  Start your journey to health and wellness today, InfowarsTeam.com.
[32:00.820 --> 32:03.060]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[32:03.060 --> 32:07.020]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage
[32:07.020 --> 32:08.660]  vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[32:08.660 --> 32:12.700]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver
[32:12.700 --> 32:13.700]  or gold?
[32:13.700 --> 32:17.060]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's
[32:17.060 --> 32:19.220]  possible that could even happen again.
[32:19.220 --> 32:23.780]  So our friends at Solutions From Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[32:23.780 --> 32:24.780]  seeds.
[32:24.780 --> 32:29.700]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense
[32:29.700 --> 32:31.580]  food for you and your family.
[32:31.580 --> 32:35.460]  And here's the best part, these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way,
[32:35.460 --> 32:39.420]  and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[32:39.420 --> 32:42.660]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[32:42.660 --> 32:49.460]  That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[32:49.460 --> 32:53.500]  That's 877-327-0365.
[32:53.500 --> 32:58.460]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[32:58.460 --> 33:05.460]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[33:28.460 --> 33:36.020]  Are we all just fools on the hill?
[33:36.020 --> 33:37.740]  I mean, we see what's going on.
[33:37.740 --> 33:43.940]  We predicted the collapse of our banking system, the development of a world government, run
[33:43.940 --> 33:49.300]  by the big megabanks, that derivatives would be used to cause it, the lies of WMDs that
[33:49.300 --> 33:50.620]  bring us to war.
[33:50.620 --> 33:55.860]  The fact that I've exposed that Al Qaeda is CIA and global is funded, they've now given
[33:55.860 --> 33:56.860]  Libya.
[33:56.860 --> 34:02.300]  They're now using Al Qaeda to attack Syria, they've given Libya to Al Qaeda, they're putting
[34:02.300 --> 34:09.020]  Muslim Brotherhood and Al Qaeda in charge in, of course, places like Egypt.
[34:09.020 --> 34:13.860]  It's now admitted in the news that our governments, in fact, NBC reported just last week, are
[34:13.860 --> 34:16.580]  using Al Qaeda to attack Iran.
[34:16.580 --> 34:22.860]  I'm not saying Iran's good, I don't like Qaddafi, I don't like Assad of Syria, but I thought
[34:22.860 --> 34:28.020]  I needed to give my rights up and let the TSA grope my wife and children and grab my
[34:28.020 --> 34:31.540]  genitals because Al Qaeda might be hiding in there.
[34:31.540 --> 34:36.940]  No, it's really just an act of domination to train me to be a good little slave.
[34:36.940 --> 34:41.860]  Now, we've seen all the lies of government, all the lies of the special interests that
[34:41.860 --> 34:46.780]  have taken over our society, and we'd have to be naive idiots with the history of election
[34:46.780 --> 34:51.740]  fraud in this country to not see that Ron Paul's being cheated, and I've already talked
[34:51.740 --> 34:56.980]  about the fact that they're now contesting Maine, the Republican Party admits as many
[34:56.980 --> 34:59.980]  as eight different counties were not even counted, period.
[34:59.980 --> 35:04.780]  Those are all the counties where Ron Paul had double digit, double digit.
[35:04.780 --> 35:08.020]  Some cases over 20 point leads, those just didn't get counted.
[35:08.020 --> 35:12.900]  Now they want to count them, and the election commissions and others saying, no, just don't
[35:12.900 --> 35:13.900]  do that.
[35:13.900 --> 35:17.300]  Iowa's been thrown out, but that's only in local Iowa papers.
[35:17.300 --> 35:20.660]  We told you the day after it was a fraud, the R. Paul Watchers.
[35:20.660 --> 35:25.460]  And Ron Paul finally didn't want to play the part of a bad sport or a sore loser.
[35:25.460 --> 35:27.740]  He's finally going, okay, we're going to contest these.
[35:27.740 --> 35:28.740]  Well, he has to.
[35:28.740 --> 35:30.240]  It is fraud.
[35:30.240 --> 35:35.660]  You've seen all the fraud of them blocking him, ignoring him, not giving him attention.
[35:35.660 --> 35:39.740]  When he gets second place or first place, not saying it on the news, when he wins the
[35:39.740 --> 35:43.260]  straw poll, which he did win most of them not covering it, when he gets the most small
[35:43.260 --> 35:47.100]  contributions, including from the military, more than all candidates combined, they ignore
[35:47.100 --> 35:48.100]  it.
[35:48.100 --> 35:50.500]  I'm on the road coming to you from Baton Rouge.
[35:50.500 --> 35:53.740]  That's why the audio is a little bit choppy from time to time, but we're working on that
[35:53.740 --> 36:00.100]  and very thankful to XM channel 166, all of our affiliates and internet listeners at infowars.com.
[36:00.100 --> 36:03.940]  I want to direct everyone to infowars.com.
[36:03.940 --> 36:07.700]  And Ron Paul is being cheated out of the Republican nomination.
[36:07.700 --> 36:11.740]  The GOP establishment has resorted to vote fraud in almost every state, and we have the
[36:11.740 --> 36:17.540]  proof all linked, not from alternative media, but from mainstream media admitting it.
[36:17.540 --> 36:20.180]  This is admitted, but it's not a big issue.
[36:20.180 --> 36:26.180]  Now, Mankow was down in Austin a few weeks ago, great guy, went out to eat when they
[36:26.180 --> 36:27.180]  hung out.
[36:27.180 --> 36:29.580]  In fact, I'm going to finally upload the videos we shot today.
[36:29.580 --> 36:31.300]  I've gotten so busy, I keep procrastinating.
[36:31.300 --> 36:35.380]  I'm going to upload those to the YouTube channel and post them at infowars.com.
[36:35.380 --> 36:37.260]  But this is big breaking news right here.
[36:37.260 --> 36:41.020]  You know, it was Mankow who asked, he always comes up with great questions, who asked Rumsfeld
[36:41.020 --> 36:46.300]  last year and ended up being played on coast to coast AM and a bunch of other big shows,
[36:46.300 --> 36:48.180]  other big syndicated radio shows.
[36:48.180 --> 36:52.260]  He asked Rumsfeld, hey, what about building 7, that 47-story building that fell on 9-11,
[36:52.260 --> 36:53.260]  wasn't hit by a plane?
[36:53.260 --> 36:56.500]  Rumsfeld laughed and said, I don't know what that is.
[36:56.500 --> 37:00.980]  And then Mankow described it to him and he said, I don't still don't know what it is.
[37:00.980 --> 37:02.540]  I'm not going to discuss that.
[37:02.540 --> 37:04.300]  Well, that's a side issue.
[37:04.300 --> 37:10.660]  The point is, Mankow told me this a year ago off record, he then, he's seen it again.
[37:10.660 --> 37:14.180]  Four years ago he saw it and he's seen it again last year and this year.
[37:14.180 --> 37:18.340]  So when Ron Paul ran in 08 and again, he's in radio stations all over the country, he's
[37:18.340 --> 37:20.340]  syndicated all over the country.
[37:20.340 --> 37:25.820]  Number one in many cities, like we are in Orlando and in Austin and other places.
[37:25.820 --> 37:32.940]  And he witnesses newsrooms, TV people, you name it, but he's not going to say names.
[37:32.940 --> 37:37.740]  He has witnessed them say, okay, he's number one, don't show that or he's number two, don't
[37:37.740 --> 37:38.740]  read that.
[37:38.740 --> 37:39.740]  Disregard that.
[37:39.740 --> 37:45.380]  You've seen it all over national TV for yourself, but he's been inside and watched it.
[37:45.380 --> 37:49.500]  And I said, go public a year ago when he told me about it, he said, no, I'm not going to.
[37:49.500 --> 37:52.780]  I said, go public a couple of weeks ago and he said, no, I'm not going to.
[37:52.780 --> 37:58.100]  But I guess it's gotten so bad that even Mankow, you know, who's a great guy, but he's a news
[37:58.100 --> 38:00.700]  guy and you don't, you know, you don't kiss and tell.
[38:00.700 --> 38:04.060]  You don't talk about what you see going on in the newsrooms or then you're not trusted
[38:04.060 --> 38:05.060]  anymore.
[38:05.060 --> 38:08.820]  Well, when people out there are engaged in treason, I guess that's when the journalistic
[38:08.820 --> 38:12.780]  code of don't tell another journalist, well, these aren't journalists, but we're not going
[38:12.780 --> 38:13.780]  to say names here.
[38:13.780 --> 38:18.940]  Well, we'll go as far as he wants to go his website, Mankow.com, he's got the Mankow
[38:18.940 --> 38:20.700]  militia out there.
[38:20.700 --> 38:24.980]  And we're very thankful to have him on his busy schedule, Mankow, go as far as you can
[38:24.980 --> 38:30.020]  here without getting fired like Pat Buchanan or Judge Napolitano, because we don't want
[38:30.020 --> 38:31.020]  to see that happen.
[38:31.020 --> 38:35.940]  But, but, but, I mean, you told me so much, my God, about some of this.
[38:35.940 --> 38:38.940]  Yeah, I appreciate you, are you hearing me?
[38:38.940 --> 38:40.940]  Okay, I know you're in Baton Rouge.
[38:40.940 --> 38:41.940]  Yes, sir.
[38:41.940 --> 38:46.900]  Okay, listen, and I do want to tell people when you put those videos up at infowars.com,
[38:46.900 --> 38:50.700]  we see and people are gonna think we're kidding here, we're not, you're gonna see a fish,
[38:50.700 --> 39:04.880]  a fish with fur, the legendary
[39:04.880 --> 39:05.880]  egg.
[39:05.880 --> 39:10.700]  Look, I could have had an interview with Al Gore after the big election debacle, I could
[39:10.700 --> 39:13.660]  have had the first interview, but it had to be scripted.
[39:13.660 --> 39:20.340]  After the trial, I was offered the first interview with O.J. Simpson, but it had to be scripted.
[39:20.340 --> 39:25.060]  I have these offers all the time, but they have to have the questions ahead of time,
[39:25.060 --> 39:30.460]  and they have to know what I'm going to say and how I'm going to react, and I refuse.
[39:30.460 --> 39:38.260]  Now, I am friends with the top radio people in America, the big shows, the big names,
[39:38.260 --> 39:41.980]  and these are people that, you know, if you're talking about right wing, I guess they go
[39:41.980 --> 39:47.900]  on vacation with the president, they go on vacation with the vice president, and I would
[39:47.900 --> 39:48.900]  talk with these guys.
[39:48.900 --> 39:53.380]  I mean, these are the names, you know, they're huge names, and, and, hey, yeah, so and so
[39:53.380 --> 39:57.860]  sending the helicopter to come get me, the vice president, and then you see the Republican
[39:57.860 --> 39:58.860]  talking points.
[39:58.860 --> 40:03.500]  Look, these are good people, they're trying to feed their families, and they're doing
[40:03.500 --> 40:04.700]  a reasonably good job.
[40:04.700 --> 40:10.900]  I just, I just can't sell out, you know, Alex, if you and I would sell out, we'd be much
[40:10.900 --> 40:11.900]  bigger.
[40:11.900 --> 40:18.060]  But look, I've been in the newspapers, I've been in the major TV networks, and I have
[40:18.060 --> 40:25.980]  seen how Ron Paul wins every single time, and for years, I saw, no, no, it's Giuliani.
[40:25.980 --> 40:29.900]  But wait a minute, it's not Giuliani, it's Ron Paul.
[40:29.900 --> 40:33.820]  Yeah, but Ron Paul fans, you know, they're, all those people with Ron Paul, they're just
[40:33.820 --> 40:38.980]  they're fanatical followers, and, and so, wait a minute, what about Obama followers?
[40:38.980 --> 40:40.620]  Were they fanatical?
[40:40.620 --> 40:45.740]  What about followers of, of McCain or, or Bush or whoever?
[40:45.740 --> 40:52.940]  Here's the thing, guys, if you're going to talk about on the left, who's the little
[40:52.940 --> 40:57.140]  guy, I can't think of his name right now, the little, the midget guy, marriage a beautiful
[40:57.140 --> 41:02.380]  woman who, who believes in UFOs, that, that, that could be Kucinich, okay?
[41:02.380 --> 41:06.860]  If you're going to talk about the left, Kucinich is a game changer, he's unique, and if you're
[41:06.860 --> 41:12.220]  going to talk about the right, and I'm not a Kucinich fan, but if you're going to talk
[41:12.220 --> 41:15.500]  about the right, the only game changer really is Ron Paul.
[41:15.500 --> 41:19.100]  I wish he would buy a suit that would fit, he looks like David Byrne in the Talking
[41:19.100 --> 41:23.260]  Heads video, you know, he's super stupid, get him a suit that fits, but Ron Paul is
[41:23.260 --> 41:27.060]  a game changer, he wants to end the fed, he wants to protect America, he wants to let
[41:27.060 --> 41:32.740]  these crazy Islamo kooks kill each other and let us stay out of it, I mean, this guy really
[41:32.740 --> 41:37.140]  is a game changer, they can't have that, Mitt Romney's going to keep things just like Bush
[41:37.140 --> 41:42.660]  or Obama or anyone else, now I've broken bread with Obama, and I've broken bread with
[41:42.660 --> 41:47.500]  Mitt, one-on-one private time with these guys, and we're just going to get more of
[41:47.500 --> 41:51.860]  the same, that's it, we're going to pay more and more, we're going to be enslaved more
[41:51.860 --> 41:57.940]  and more, and the people in power get richer and richer, so Ron Paul is a game changer,
[41:57.940 --> 42:02.540]  and the people love him, and you go to a Ron Paul event, and I challenge anyone to challenge
[42:02.540 --> 42:08.580]  me on this, if I'm laying them down and I'm breathing, Alex, and that is, there's excitement
[42:08.580 --> 42:13.940]  around Ron Paul, there's huge crouch, the college kids, I mean, you know, Obama, the
[42:13.940 --> 42:17.940]  college kids forget it, they love Ron Paul, when they hear his message of freedom, which
[42:17.940 --> 42:24.940]  is dangerous, they go crazy, human beings naturally want freedom, and that's what Ron
[42:24.940 --> 42:31.660]  Paul offers, and you know, do we really think, Mitt, out of Massachusetts, do we really think
[42:31.660 --> 42:38.140]  he is going to change anything, is he better than Obama, anybody though Obama, anybody
[42:38.140 --> 42:42.740]  but Bush, anybody but, I'm so sick of voting against something in this country, I'd like
[42:42.740 --> 42:47.220]  to vote for him, exactly, but man Cal, do we really believe that conservatives really
[42:47.220 --> 42:51.580]  want Mitt Romney, and he's really number one, but I want to go back to this, I want to go
[42:51.580 --> 42:55.300]  back because we've seen them suppressing him in every level, we now have confirmed at least
[42:55.300 --> 43:00.820]  two states, we have partial evidence of fraud in Nevada and South Carolina, very strong,
[43:00.820 --> 43:07.180]  but in Iowa, and in Maine, it's ironclad, it's now admitted, so my question to you is
[43:07.180 --> 43:13.340]  without breaking confidence with people, specifically, because you say in multiple newsrooms and
[43:13.340 --> 43:18.740]  other areas, you've seen them, four years ago, but now even more, and I know you travel
[43:18.740 --> 43:26.220]  like a wonder lost poster child, I mean you're somewhere new, multiple times a week, I mean
[43:26.220 --> 43:31.140]  literally, Globetrotter, so you're seeing all this, and you're an icon out there and
[43:31.140 --> 43:35.980]  talk radio, everybody knows man Cal from William Shatner to Mother Teresa, so let's expand
[43:35.980 --> 43:43.500]  on this, specifically, what type of stuff do we, those of us outside of this, what are
[43:43.500 --> 43:46.380]  we missing, tell us, give us some stories.
[43:46.380 --> 43:51.020]  No, I mean, this is pretty well, can you can play some clips, there are radio people,
[43:51.020 --> 43:55.740]  there are TV people that say, yeah look, we just, whenever it comes to Ron Paul, we just
[43:55.740 --> 44:03.140]  regard it, and so, you know, when I'm talking to the moderators, Chuck E. Todd, the creep
[44:03.140 --> 44:08.140]  with no neck from NBC, who's just an absolute mouthpiece of Obama, I mean they just, oh
[44:08.140 --> 44:13.300]  yeah, Ron Paul, look, now if you're talking to Michael Steele or the head guys in the
[44:13.300 --> 44:20.140]  Republican Party, what they will tell you is, the Mormon money is endless, the Catholics
[44:20.140 --> 44:25.420]  got their guy with JFK and the Mormons want their guy, the Muslims got their guy with
[44:25.420 --> 44:29.820]  Obama, oh I'm just kidding, he's fantastic, he's totally a Christian Obama, he's fantastic,
[44:29.820 --> 44:33.500]  I'm just kidding, he's not really a Muslim, even though he's given rise to the Muslim
[44:33.500 --> 44:40.540]  Brotherhood all over the world, maybe Santorum has a point about this guy you think, anyway,
[44:40.540 --> 44:47.100]  the Mormons want their guy in, the Republicans want the money, and then look, it's a business
[44:47.100 --> 44:54.140]  thing man, Ron Paul doesn't have the dollars, Santorum doesn't have the dollars, Mitt Romney
[44:54.140 --> 45:00.260]  has endless money, what's he make, $57,000 a day without having to do the work, and then
[45:00.260 --> 45:04.260]  the Mormon church is backing them, the Republicans know it's going to take a lot of money because
[45:04.260 --> 45:11.660]  Obama has Hollywood money, Obama has the liberal money, they want their agenda to stay in there,
[45:11.660 --> 45:16.980]  and so they're going to need a lot of money to fight Obama, I don't think all of it is
[45:16.980 --> 45:20.380]  sinister, Alex, I think they just think Mitt has a lot of money and is going to take a
[45:20.380 --> 45:25.740]  lot of money to beat Obama, but if you want to talk about actual numbers, if you want
[45:25.740 --> 45:31.100]  to talk about straw polls, you want to talk about voting, I have seen it, I believe often
[45:31.100 --> 45:40.100]  times, often times, Ron Paul wins, and they just can't, hey let me tell you something,
[45:40.100 --> 45:46.140]  can you still hear me, yes I can, you broke him a bit, I know you're on the road, listen,
[45:46.140 --> 45:51.620]  I was in a polling place in Chicago where the dead vote, you know, it's the mob in Chicago
[45:51.620 --> 45:58.700]  I believe that got JFK elected, sorry, and then of course Bobby Kennedy went after the
[45:58.700 --> 46:04.860]  mob, so they took care of them, but look, look, look, look, I saw this with my own eyes,
[46:04.860 --> 46:10.100]  I was in a voting booth in Chicago, and they opened up the voting machine, and it hadn't
[46:10.100 --> 46:14.780]  been emptied, and none of the votes had been counted, I'm really starting to wonder from
[46:14.780 --> 46:19.460]  the last election, so I'm really starting to wonder if it even matters, look, the script
[46:19.460 --> 46:24.140]  is Mitt Romney, Mitt Romney, Mitt Romney, and you know the controversial views that the
[46:24.140 --> 46:28.620]  Mormon church has on African Americans, do you know about Mitt, he has to buy his underwear
[46:28.620 --> 46:32.020]  at church, do you know that Mitt Romney believes that his parents, when they died, they got
[46:32.020 --> 46:36.620]  their own planet that they became gods of, look, I have nothing to guess Mormons, Donny
[46:36.620 --> 46:41.460]  Osmond's the buddy of mine, Mitt Romney's a friend of mine, but why isn't the media
[46:41.460 --> 46:46.420]  talking about any of this, because they want Mitt Romney to be the candidate, and then they
[46:46.420 --> 46:50.220]  can easily destroy him, they want Mitt because he can be beaten.
[46:50.220 --> 46:54.820]  Hey, now what's wrong with getting your own planet, so Obama gets 47 virgins.
[46:54.820 --> 46:59.540]  No, he's a Christian, he's totally a Christian.
[46:59.540 --> 47:06.140]  It's a joke, it's a joke, look, what he is, is he's CIA, he's the immaculate conception
[47:06.140 --> 47:10.500]  by the CIA, and they want the Muslim Brotherhood in charge in Al Qaeda, so they'll tear that
[47:10.500 --> 47:15.860]  whole place apart and destabilize it, but man Cal, getting serious here for a moment,
[47:15.860 --> 47:19.980]  look, I mean you did tell me the stories, you told me names, all of it where you're
[47:19.980 --> 47:25.700]  witnessing it, and it's all happening, but you're right, they're so arrogant about this,
[47:25.700 --> 47:31.340]  they'll even say on the news, in fact that famous video clip that John Stuart did where
[47:31.340 --> 47:35.860]  he put all the compilations together, where all the networks were saying, if he wins,
[47:35.860 --> 47:41.020]  I don't care, we're not covering it, and they all start laughing, where he gets second place,
[47:41.020 --> 47:45.220]  all the networks report first and third place and fourth place and fifth place, but not
[47:45.220 --> 47:46.220]  second place.
[47:46.220 --> 47:47.220]  The fix is in.
[47:47.220 --> 47:54.140]  They cut him off, he gets no respect, but the fact is, he has a message that is resonating,
[47:54.140 --> 47:57.500]  you know, look, you're either got guns and guts in less government, or you want the government
[47:57.500 --> 48:01.820]  to control everything, you want to be hanging off that welfare teat, me, I want to work
[48:01.820 --> 48:05.220]  for my money, and I want to keep my money, and I want to decide how to spend it, I want
[48:05.220 --> 48:09.620]  to spend it on my kids, not on a bunch of fat people sitting around with type two diabetes,
[48:09.620 --> 48:14.300]  you know, the lemmings, the sheeple off the cliff, I gotcha.
[48:14.300 --> 48:17.660]  Ron Paul, and what else can I tell you, Alex, I thought, you know, think of the top three
[48:17.660 --> 48:21.580]  radio shows, think of what they are, I'm just telling you, I've been with these people,
[48:21.580 --> 48:26.780]  Ron Paul wins, and they don't report it, think of the big newspapers, I'm in Chicago, Ron
[48:26.780 --> 48:32.980]  Paul wins, the TV networks, I've been on all these shows, Ron Paul wins, and they don't
[48:32.980 --> 48:33.980]  report it.
[48:33.980 --> 48:36.220]  What else do you want to know?
[48:36.220 --> 48:42.060]  Well, it totally illustrates what complete frauds they are, and they want to keep this
[48:42.060 --> 48:47.460]  two-party dictatorship going, I mean, look at Romney, he's in the past, he's now changed,
[48:47.460 --> 48:53.380]  he claims, four abortion, four open borders, four carbon taxes, four world government,
[48:53.380 --> 48:59.260]  wrote the model of Obamacare, and the list goes on and on, this is what the Republican
[48:59.260 --> 49:07.460]  party leadership wants to give us, separately, I thought Mormons are against abortion, I
[49:07.460 --> 49:11.620]  thought Mormons were against world government, I want to know why Mormons are supporting
[49:11.620 --> 49:12.620]  him.
[49:12.620 --> 49:17.780]  I couldn't tell you I'm not a Mormon, look, Alex, you probably have a lot of Mormon listeners,
[49:17.780 --> 49:22.020]  they are very wise in many ways, they're wise in business, they also believe in having
[49:22.020 --> 49:26.860]  a year's supply of food, they're buying the seats, they're stocking up on water and ammo,
[49:26.860 --> 49:29.860]  I mean, there's a lot to do- Well, yeah, that's what I found is my Mormon listeners
[49:29.860 --> 49:34.540]  are pretty awake, so why is the Mormon church supporting him?
[49:34.540 --> 49:39.340]  I couldn't tell you, listen, Alex, I had a school field trip as we talked about the
[49:39.340 --> 49:44.380]  anniversary of the Challenger disaster, okay, I want to say Larry Moore and there were some
[49:44.380 --> 49:49.220]  other anchor people, and they were crying on TV, I happen to be there the day the Challenger
[49:49.220 --> 49:54.060]  blew up, okay, KNBC in Kansas City, are you following me?
[49:54.060 --> 49:55.060]  Yes, sir.
[49:55.060 --> 49:58.340]  Okay, and they're crying on TV and the minute the camera went off, they're all laughing
[49:58.340 --> 50:04.380]  and saying, no, no, I said a Bud Light, and I couldn't believe it, and then I became the
[50:04.380 --> 50:09.540]  co-host in his final years of the Morton Downey TV show, and I saw the trickery, and then
[50:09.540 --> 50:14.580]  he was having fun, and it's over 50 episodes of Springer, and look, the people are throwing
[50:14.580 --> 50:19.740]  chairs and fighting, come on, come on, give it to me, give it to me, and then I was backstage
[50:19.740 --> 50:25.660]  the Irish Seek and Hulk Hogan, and they're slow-considerates and laughing, this is years
[50:25.660 --> 50:31.020]  ago, oh my God, you need to solve fate, and this is what we have right now, Mitt Romney
[50:31.020 --> 50:36.100]  versus Obama, and if you want to follow the script, I don't, I read between the headlines
[50:36.100 --> 50:41.820]  and it's all a setup, and we're getting four more years of Obama, I'm thinking it's
[50:41.820 --> 50:51.820]  alluring into the future, Alex, four more years of Obama.
[50:51.820 --> 50:55.700]  Thank you so much for spending time with us, and keep up the good work, we'll talk to you
[50:55.700 --> 50:56.700]  soon, man, Cal.
[50:56.700 --> 50:58.700]  Keep up the good fight yourself, sir, goodbye.
[50:58.700 --> 51:02.260]  All right, we'll be right back, stay with us, more news straight ahead.
[51:02.260 --> 51:06.380]  Hi, this is Alex Jones, did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid
[51:06.380 --> 51:09.300]  seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[51:09.300 --> 51:13.340]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver
[51:13.340 --> 51:14.340]  or gold?
[51:14.340 --> 51:17.660]  It's true, seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country, and
[51:17.660 --> 51:19.900]  it's possible that could even happen again.
[51:19.900 --> 51:24.420]  So our friends at Solutions From Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[51:24.420 --> 51:25.420]  seeds.
[51:25.420 --> 51:30.380]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense
[51:30.380 --> 51:34.660]  food for you and your family, and here's the best part, these seeds have not been genetically
[51:34.660 --> 51:40.060]  modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[51:40.060 --> 51:45.740]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com, that's survivalseedbank.com, or give them
[51:45.740 --> 51:57.380]  a call at 877-327-0365, that's 877-327-0365, remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds
[51:57.380 --> 51:59.100]  are the ultimate barter item.
[51:59.100 --> 52:01.660]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.

[53:59.100 --> 54:27.300]  Let's go Berkey.com today.
[54:27.300 --> 54:34.340]  A man, Cal, told us a lot but he didn't obviously tell you what he told me privately or he didn't
[54:34.340 --> 54:36.020]  tell you the details.
[54:36.020 --> 54:40.140]  He told me stuff about syndicated talk radio through the establishment syndicators that
[54:40.140 --> 54:46.300]  I already knew some of but I didn't know some of these shows have like minute long delays
[54:46.300 --> 54:52.100]  and that they're always cutting in and covering stuff up and have splices of earlier programs
[54:52.100 --> 54:55.860]  to cover up stuff about the New World Order or global government with certain talk show
[54:55.860 --> 55:04.740]  hosts if they do talk about it or if callers get through.
[55:04.740 --> 55:09.180]  Connected establishment across party lines.
[55:09.180 --> 55:15.220]  I told Ted Anderson I've said you've got to find different news radio than what we carry.
[55:15.220 --> 55:17.860]  It used to be a USA radio network.
[55:17.860 --> 55:22.780]  The Marlin Maddox ran out of Dallas and that was okay but now, I mean, it's nothing but
[55:22.780 --> 55:34.820]  the anti-Rompo and pro-war and pro-New World Order garbage and Ted is basically always
[55:34.820 --> 55:39.980]  saying is basically always saying.
[55:39.980 --> 55:40.980]  That's weird.
[55:40.980 --> 55:52.660]  I somehow just put myself on air and was hearing an echo back.
[55:52.660 --> 55:53.900]  That's crazy.
[55:53.900 --> 55:58.400]  Not only did my connection cut out to the network for a minute but then I accidentally
[55:58.400 --> 56:04.700]  clicked the video link at the top of info wars.com and so I was hearing myself only
[56:04.700 --> 56:11.820]  delayed about a second or two from the internet because yes, speaking of delays, our radio
[56:11.820 --> 56:17.980]  network feed is delayed by seven seconds to the minimum feed for FCC stations to cut
[56:17.980 --> 56:25.260]  out cuss words and then we're able to delay things seven seconds when people cuss.
[56:25.260 --> 56:30.740]  When we catch it, we do almost all the time but the internet feed itself is not.
[56:30.740 --> 56:36.300]  That's why you'll see cussing, you'll hear cussing, you'll see things live over the
[56:36.300 --> 56:40.540]  internet video and audio feed and that indeed was just happening.
[56:40.540 --> 56:51.300]  It was delayed like one second or two seconds because I just now accidentally launched the
[56:51.300 --> 56:55.420]  audio and it was delayed one second and then it launched the video because I hit the player
[56:55.420 --> 56:56.900]  and it was delayed about two seconds.
[56:56.900 --> 56:59.980]  Man, what incredible connectivity through our servers.
[56:59.980 --> 57:04.540]  I know we use CDN systems across the globe but just amazing.
[57:04.540 --> 57:08.180]  But side issue, I think the point we cut out for a moment, we usually have better luck
[57:08.180 --> 57:11.900]  than this when we're on the road but Baton Rouge, it's got good internet connections.
[57:11.900 --> 57:21.140]  It says it's four bars on the 4G but it's when we don't have a good connection that's
[57:21.140 --> 57:22.140]  cutting out.
[57:22.140 --> 57:26.540]  Oh, by the way, I should add we have Gerald Salente coming up what in the last 45 minutes
[57:26.540 --> 57:30.140]  and a third hour on the host of Economic Issues and I got a bunch of other news I'm going
[57:30.140 --> 57:34.540]  to cover but I do want to say now, wide open phones and I'm going to say first time callers.
[57:34.540 --> 57:36.620]  I like to do that at least once a week.
[57:36.620 --> 57:41.100]  First time callers, your chance to get involved on air on any issue or question or comment
[57:41.100 --> 57:42.100]  you want to raise.
[57:42.100 --> 57:52.700]  And the toll free number to join us here today is 800-259-9231-800-259-9231.
[57:52.700 --> 58:01.540]  I'm getting back to the fact that the two political parties are basically, you know,
[58:01.540 --> 58:10.540]  a quantity of lines, if you want a sterling crystal clear example of that, a crystal clear
[58:10.540 --> 58:17.020]  example of that, it's how Republicans style radio and TV and news radio ignore Ron Paul
[58:17.020 --> 58:21.620]  and say you can't win with the same talking points just like the Democratic operative
[58:21.620 --> 58:27.540]  wing of the whole New World Order system does it as well.
[58:27.540 --> 58:33.220]  And so that's how they do it, that's how they carry this system out.
[58:33.220 --> 58:35.060]  And it just shows how outrageous.
[58:35.060 --> 58:38.860]  So we're here revealing the emperor has no clothes, that it's a little man behind the
[58:38.860 --> 58:44.860]  curtain, the great laws, the great powerful laws, we're exposing the hoax.
[58:44.860 --> 58:52.420]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:52.420 --> 58:55.500]  I've been telling you about eFoods Direct for a while now.
[58:55.500 --> 58:59.260]  Here are my top 10 reasons to stock up on food from eFoods Direct.
[58:59.260 --> 59:02.300]  Number 10, the food I get from eFoods Direct tastes great.
[59:02.300 --> 59:05.020]  Number 9, the eFoods meals are easy to prepare.
[59:05.020 --> 59:08.380]  Eight, eFoods Direct delivers the food right to my front door.
[59:08.380 --> 59:11.340]  Seven, most of these meals cost less than $2.
[59:11.340 --> 59:14.580]  Six, with their large variety, I can eat it every day.
[59:14.580 --> 59:18.500]  Five, I always have access to high quality and delicious food.
[59:18.500 --> 59:22.500]  Number four, eFoods products don't spoil, so I never waste any food.
[59:22.500 --> 59:25.900]  Three, eFoods uses only safe, healthy ingredients.
[59:25.900 --> 59:30.140]  Number two, I have my own food supply and don't depend on the grocery store.
[59:30.140 --> 59:35.300]  And the number one reason I promote eFoods Direct is they build special offers just for
[59:35.300 --> 59:36.300]  my listeners.
[59:36.300 --> 59:40.580]  Folks, don't wait, get prepared now, we all need to be self-sufficient.
[59:40.580 --> 59:45.700]  Call eFoods Direct at 800-409-5633 and ask for the Alex Jones Special.
[59:45.700 --> 59:55.020]  Call eFoods Direct at 800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[59:55.020 --> 1:00:06.900]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[1:00:06.900 --> 1:00:11.740]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[1:00:11.740 --> 1:00:12.740]  You want answers?
[1:00:12.740 --> 1:00:14.900]  Well, so does he.
[1:00:14.900 --> 1:00:19.100]  He's Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[1:00:19.100 --> 1:00:24.900]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:24.900 --> 1:00:39.180]  Okay, my friends, it is hour number two.
[1:00:39.180 --> 1:00:47.700]  I'm coming to you from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, overlooking the big old Mississippi River.
[1:00:47.700 --> 1:00:51.700]  And I'm looking at the big highway bridge that comes across right here.
[1:00:51.700 --> 1:00:54.260]  I shot a video out there talking about Ron Paul earlier.
[1:00:54.260 --> 1:00:58.580]  I got a whole bunch of videos that I'm going to be uploading to the YouTube channel and
[1:00:58.580 --> 1:01:01.180]  the PrismPlanet.tv here today.
[1:01:01.180 --> 1:01:05.420]  I'm going to be posting those at infowords.com.
[1:01:05.420 --> 1:01:11.380]  With a break, I am going to start going to your phone calls.
[1:01:11.380 --> 1:01:14.420]  There's a bunch of other top stories at infowords.com.
[1:01:14.420 --> 1:01:19.420]  In fact, let me go ahead and go over there to that site and tell you some of what I'll
[1:01:19.420 --> 1:01:27.620]  be interspersing with your phone calls.
[1:01:27.620 --> 1:01:29.620]  This is some really bad news.
[1:01:29.620 --> 1:01:33.900]  But the head of the TSA, Pistol, two years ago said, well, we're starting the naked
[1:01:33.900 --> 1:01:39.300]  body scanners and they'll be opt-outs at first, but soon it will be mandatory.
[1:01:39.300 --> 1:01:41.660]  And they're upping the radiation power, you name it.
[1:01:41.660 --> 1:01:44.660]  And they're also groping people I've noticed after you go through the scanners.
[1:01:44.660 --> 1:01:46.460]  They implied that that was for the scanners.
[1:01:46.460 --> 1:01:48.500]  No, they want to put their hands on you.
[1:01:48.500 --> 1:01:53.460]  So it looks like air travel will soon be out of the question for everybody who doesn't
[1:01:53.460 --> 1:01:54.940]  want to be groped and violated.
[1:01:54.940 --> 1:02:00.860]  But then soon they'll just be on every highway, like they're already there, I'm saying soon.
[1:02:00.860 --> 1:02:02.260]  Soon they'll be everywhere.
[1:02:02.260 --> 1:02:06.660]  TSA questioning, body scanner opt-outs.
[1:02:06.660 --> 1:02:10.900]  So this is just absolutely horrific, this federal power grab.
[1:02:10.900 --> 1:02:15.300]  They are hell bent on absolutely wrecking our society.
[1:02:15.300 --> 1:02:19.100]  More and more people are refusing the naked body scanners.
[1:02:19.100 --> 1:02:25.220]  And so they are moving to do this, refusing to be irradiated, treated as suspicious behavior.
[1:02:25.220 --> 1:02:31.340]  So we've got to say even more, you know, note of these criminals even more because we've
[1:02:31.340 --> 1:02:36.500]  got to start saying no to the highway checkpoints, the basketball football game checkpoints.
[1:02:36.500 --> 1:02:41.380]  This is just an overthrowing of our entire system of government.
[1:02:41.380 --> 1:02:51.300]  Also globalist push, internet control, freak-treating at the United Nations.
[1:02:51.300 --> 1:02:59.380]  And also, again, Ron Paul is being cheated out of Republican nomination, counterterrorism,
[1:02:59.380 --> 1:03:02.740]  and northern border drug strategy tied to perimeter security deal.
[1:03:02.740 --> 1:03:06.500]  Yeah, they said in the SPP documents from five years ago that they would use border
[1:03:06.500 --> 1:03:11.940]  securities, the pretext to get rid of national sovereignty and actually integrate North America.
[1:03:11.940 --> 1:03:17.500]  Also counterterrorism and northern border strategy deal will be used so they can control
[1:03:17.500 --> 1:03:21.460]  who brings in the narcotics and only shut down their competition.
[1:03:21.460 --> 1:03:24.780]  Also regulators harm small businesses and protect corporations.
[1:03:24.780 --> 1:03:28.340]  Big article, the national poll there showing the America people get it.
[1:03:28.340 --> 1:03:33.340]  So big news, Google caught violating browser privacy settings.
[1:03:33.340 --> 1:03:40.300]  The track users turns out that with Microsoft and Apple, with their browsers, that even
[1:03:40.300 --> 1:03:44.260]  if you block the Google cookies, they still track what you're doing and get around it,
[1:03:44.260 --> 1:03:45.260]  which is illegal.
[1:03:45.260 --> 1:03:49.740]  But they don't care because they're NSA and that article by Paul Joseph Watson breaks
[1:03:49.740 --> 1:03:50.940]  that down as well.
[1:03:50.940 --> 1:03:51.940]  Really important article.
[1:03:51.940 --> 1:03:57.680]  Also, we've got a compilation of videos and documentation with Adam Kokesh on why the
[1:03:57.680 --> 1:04:01.660]  media ignore the veterans for Ron Paul's rally yesterday that was a big success.
[1:04:01.660 --> 1:04:06.820]  Two powerful videos with Nigel Farage, the UK Independence Party, a grease being destroyed
[1:04:06.820 --> 1:04:10.940]  by EU, fanatical ideology.
[1:04:10.940 --> 1:04:17.580]  That is just some of the info that we've got right now up at infowars.com.
[1:04:17.580 --> 1:04:24.820]  And don't forget, we're also streaming video of myself here on the road and that's all
[1:04:24.820 --> 1:04:29.180]  online right now at prisonplanet.tv.
[1:04:29.180 --> 1:04:34.820]  But your phone calls straight ahead after this quick break.
[1:04:34.820 --> 1:04:40.500]  And we'll get to James, Ken, and many others that are patiently holding right now.
[1:04:40.500 --> 1:04:48.660]  And Gerald Salente is coming up among my way to Orlando, driving to avoid family being
[1:04:48.660 --> 1:04:53.940]  molested by criminal out of control federal potbellied pedophile pieces of absolutely
[1:04:53.940 --> 1:04:54.940]  un-American trash.
[1:04:54.940 --> 1:04:58.900]  Well, they ride back as we continue to expose the murdering psychotic criminals that have
[1:04:58.900 --> 1:05:02.700]  hijacked our government.
[1:05:02.700 --> 1:05:09.380]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[1:05:09.380 --> 1:05:14.140]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[1:05:14.140 --> 1:05:23.140]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[1:05:23.140 --> 1:05:30.260]  They so pride in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit.
[1:05:30.260 --> 1:05:36.380]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[1:05:36.380 --> 1:05:41.340]  Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[1:05:41.340 --> 1:05:48.140]  We turned jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[1:05:48.140 --> 1:05:52.700]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can
[1:05:52.700 --> 1:05:54.860]  ride all day with confidence.
[1:05:54.860 --> 1:05:57.780]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[1:05:57.780 --> 1:06:01.900]  Diamond gusset jeans got it, others don't.
[1:06:01.900 --> 1:06:06.700]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had
[1:06:06.700 --> 1:06:09.220]  a pretty good size meal that I was still starving.
[1:06:09.220 --> 1:06:14.020]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops
[1:06:14.020 --> 1:06:18.180]  on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[1:06:18.180 --> 1:06:23.780]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to
[1:06:23.780 --> 1:06:26.940]  rebuild themselves, fight off cancer and be healthy.
[1:06:26.940 --> 1:06:33.260]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity.
[1:06:33.260 --> 1:06:37.620]  The Young Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need and once
[1:06:37.620 --> 1:06:41.260]  you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[1:06:41.260 --> 1:06:47.820]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[1:06:47.820 --> 1:06:49.100]  Check it out for yourself.
[1:06:49.100 --> 1:06:50.100]  It's incredible.
[1:06:50.100 --> 1:06:55.980]  Go to infowarseteam.com today and order your first canister of Beyond Tangy Tangerine Complete
[1:06:55.980 --> 1:06:59.180]  Multivitamin Mineral Complex Dietary Supplement.

[1:07:01.700 --> 1:07:06.340]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[1:07:06.340 --> 1:07:10.660]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[1:07:10.660 --> 1:07:14.980]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[1:07:14.980 --> 1:07:16.300]  allows you to have.
[1:07:16.300 --> 1:07:17.300]  It's true.
[1:07:17.300 --> 1:07:22.020]  There's no government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[1:07:22.020 --> 1:07:26.340]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[1:07:26.340 --> 1:07:30.340]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[1:07:30.340 --> 1:07:33.860]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[1:07:33.860 --> 1:07:37.540]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[1:07:37.540 --> 1:07:42.300]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[1:07:42.300 --> 1:07:46.100]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[1:07:46.100 --> 1:07:47.460]  to my oldest sponsors.
[1:07:47.460 --> 1:07:51.700]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[1:07:51.700 --> 1:07:53.300]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[1:07:53.300 --> 1:08:02.340]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[1:08:02.340 --> 1:08:08.260]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network probably presents the Alex Jones Show because there's
[1:08:08.260 --> 1:08:11.940]  a war on for your mind.
[1:08:11.940 --> 1:08:17.140]  All right, let's do it.
[1:08:17.140 --> 1:08:18.260]  Let's do it live.
[1:08:18.260 --> 1:08:19.940]  I can do it.
[1:08:19.940 --> 1:08:21.700]  I don't need to tell a prompter.
[1:08:21.700 --> 1:08:22.700]  It's shocking.
[1:08:22.700 --> 1:08:27.140]  I'm going to, I'm going to write it live like Bill O'Reilly says.
[1:08:27.140 --> 1:08:29.260]  And that was Sting taking a sound tonight.
[1:08:29.260 --> 1:08:30.260]  See you back tomorrow.
[1:08:30.260 --> 1:08:34.260]  All right, we are back live, unscripted, and we're going to be taking your calls this
[1:08:34.260 --> 1:08:35.260]  hour.
[1:08:35.260 --> 1:08:38.020]  At the bottom of the hour, I knew this was coming.
[1:08:38.020 --> 1:08:40.340]  They said they'd do it two years ago.
[1:08:40.340 --> 1:08:46.340]  TSA, questioning body scanner opt-outs and now threatening to stop people from flying
[1:08:46.340 --> 1:08:49.220]  saying you might be a terrorist.
[1:08:49.220 --> 1:08:50.420]  They're pulling people aside.
[1:08:50.420 --> 1:08:52.500]  We've got press reports of this and getting in their face.
[1:08:52.500 --> 1:08:58.300]  Hey, I find it suspicious that you a pot-bellied sack of garbage want to stick your hands in
[1:08:58.300 --> 1:09:02.620]  my pants or grab my genitals and that you have me walk through an area that thousands
[1:09:02.620 --> 1:09:12.260]  walk through in my socks, getting flesh-eating bacteria, you know, MRSA, all sorts of funguses,
[1:09:12.260 --> 1:09:14.060]  viruses, bacteria.
[1:09:14.060 --> 1:09:20.140]  I find it suspicious that you want to wear gloves like I'm dirty and bad, you punk, but
[1:09:20.140 --> 1:09:24.620]  you're not going to change gloves violating all sorts of regulations.
[1:09:24.620 --> 1:09:29.140]  I find it suspicious that you're a big enough idiot to sit around radiation machines that
[1:09:29.140 --> 1:09:33.580]  on record, top scientists have said in the New York Times even, are giving you cancer.
[1:09:33.580 --> 1:09:38.300]  And you go, they tell us it's safe, I don't like your conspiracy theories, Jones.
[1:09:38.300 --> 1:09:41.460]  Yeah, I hear your show.
[1:09:41.460 --> 1:09:45.660]  This gives off one-one billionth of the radiation of a...
[1:09:45.660 --> 1:09:53.660]  They're pulling up to just hands to your clothes, mm-hmm.
[1:09:53.660 --> 1:09:57.980]  The fool has said in his heart there is no radiation coming out of an X-ray machine.
[1:09:57.980 --> 1:10:01.420]  I mean, I don't know what to say to you people, and if folks are like, you don't like it,
[1:10:01.420 --> 1:10:02.420]  just don't fly.
[1:10:02.420 --> 1:10:06.740]  And then Obama says, hey, don't worry, last year's State of the Union, not this year's.
[1:10:06.740 --> 1:10:11.180]  He's a grab nationwide train, 200 miles an hour, no more pat-downs.
[1:10:11.180 --> 1:10:16.060]  Of course, he already knew for five years before that they'd been groping at New York,
[1:10:16.060 --> 1:10:20.660]  Boston, Dallas, Chicago, and now in Dallas, they're just everywhere.
[1:10:20.660 --> 1:10:24.380]  The people all over Dallas were like, I saw them, I saw them.
[1:10:24.380 --> 1:10:30.460]  We were driving past the dark stations and saw the little TSA signs that they're helping.
[1:10:30.460 --> 1:10:35.060]  The feds are here, there's no jurisdiction, and these aren't even sworn officers.
[1:10:35.060 --> 1:10:39.420]  There was a time when the FBI even, well, actually, I've had the FBI in my office a
[1:10:39.420 --> 1:10:43.060]  couple of times over the years, they always had to have an Austin cop with them.
[1:10:43.060 --> 1:10:48.180]  I've had the ATF there, and they had an Austin cop with them.
[1:10:48.180 --> 1:10:52.340]  I've had the Secret Service there, didn't have an Austin cop, I guess, because it's
[1:10:52.340 --> 1:10:57.940]  for the El Presidente, the Praetorian Guard doesn't need to come snooping around.
[1:10:57.940 --> 1:11:01.260]  And these guys always show up at the federal badges and wearing a suit, you're supposed
[1:11:01.260 --> 1:11:06.060]  to start just going to the bathroom all over yourself.
[1:11:06.060 --> 1:11:09.540]  I'm always, you know, you work for an narcotics trafficking murdering group.
[1:11:09.540 --> 1:11:12.260]  Just want to get that straight here, I consider you criminal.
[1:11:12.260 --> 1:11:16.020]  You may not be individually criminal, but I consider your entire organization criminal.
[1:11:16.020 --> 1:11:20.380]  You got that straight, and they're always starting to smile at you, sometimes they kind
[1:11:20.380 --> 1:11:22.820]  of bow up, and I go, I don't care.
[1:11:22.820 --> 1:11:26.540]  The government runs giant, shod kidnapping rings, I'm done playing games with you.
[1:11:26.540 --> 1:11:30.380]  See, I recognize the bad guys, you understand that?
[1:11:30.380 --> 1:11:35.060]  I recognize who ships, guns into Mexico and drugs back in the U.S. and gets caught in
[1:11:35.060 --> 1:11:37.300]  federal court and doesn't get in trouble.
[1:11:37.300 --> 1:11:38.700]  You only bust the little guys.
[1:11:38.700 --> 1:11:43.740]  Now, I know that about half of the feds, and probably 75% from the research I've done
[1:11:43.740 --> 1:11:48.460]  with police, are actually dealing with real crime and are compartmentalized, and you're
[1:11:48.460 --> 1:11:54.460]  called idiots and morons by the dark side, and that's an on record from Serpa Co and
[1:11:54.460 --> 1:12:00.580]  everything else that you're known as the morons, as the chumps.
[1:12:00.580 --> 1:12:04.500]  And when you try to stop those above you that are criminals, you know what they do?
[1:12:04.500 --> 1:12:09.940]  They blow your head off, or they plant something on you, or they say, oh, you didn't fill
[1:12:09.940 --> 1:12:14.980]  these expense reports out, kind of like Colonel Schaefer started exposing government involvement
[1:12:14.980 --> 1:12:19.260]  in 9-11, and the fact they were blocked from killing bin Laden when he was heading up the
[1:12:19.260 --> 1:12:26.980]  main hit teams, and they just said, oh, cell phone bill to his wife, he shouldn't have been
[1:12:26.980 --> 1:12:30.900]  using his private, his government Pentagon phone to call his wife when you're allowed
[1:12:30.900 --> 1:12:33.260]  to call your wife when you're at work on your Pentagon cell phone.
[1:12:33.260 --> 1:12:38.980]  They tried to remember that when he testified before Congress about strata-sivvy-enabled
[1:12:38.980 --> 1:12:43.580]  danger, and then suddenly they were talking about criminal charges for cell phone bill
[1:12:43.580 --> 1:12:49.140]  of 60-something dollars, and yes, they actually talked about pins that he may have taken from
[1:12:49.140 --> 1:12:50.140]  the office.
[1:12:50.140 --> 1:12:52.380]  You heard me, plastic pins.
[1:12:52.380 --> 1:12:58.660]  The guy has such a goody two shoes, cell phone bills, and plastic pins.
[1:12:58.660 --> 1:13:02.260]  Plastic Pentagon pins.
[1:13:02.260 --> 1:13:03.900]  There's pins missing from the office.
[1:13:03.900 --> 1:13:09.180]  I can buy like 50 pins and stick them in a cup, and they're gone in a week at my office.
[1:13:09.180 --> 1:13:12.340]  Well, I'm sorry, I'm covering up for criminals now.
[1:13:12.340 --> 1:13:18.260]  Oh, my gosh, 60-something dollars in cell phone bills and some pins.
[1:13:18.260 --> 1:13:27.420]  Meanwhile, again, the naivete is what is allowing this to happen, and I'm done playing games
[1:13:27.420 --> 1:13:28.420]  with it.
[1:13:28.420 --> 1:13:32.500]  I'm done living in this world of denial, so I'm going to be getting into that report
[1:13:32.500 --> 1:13:35.780]  and a lot more, but it's an action alert here.
[1:13:35.780 --> 1:13:39.780]  Yeah, I saw some of the commenters last night, and I'm going to your calls when I shot a
[1:13:39.780 --> 1:13:45.620]  video at a truck stop gas station, we were gasping up through the M4S RV that I have
[1:13:45.620 --> 1:13:50.620]  to use because I will not be grubbed, and I will not have my family grubbed because
[1:13:50.620 --> 1:13:51.620]  I can't handle it.
[1:13:51.620 --> 1:13:56.660]  There's already been an incident where they started grubbing my daughter once and it didn't
[1:13:56.660 --> 1:14:03.060]  go well, and nothing ever happened of it because they didn't want, I guess they didn't want
[1:14:03.060 --> 1:14:09.740]  the image of somebody standing up to them, but I can't handle it.
[1:14:09.740 --> 1:14:14.380]  You may think in America that enforcing deadly vaccines on you filled with cancer viruses
[1:14:14.380 --> 1:14:16.780]  and mercury and lead and everything else is good.
[1:14:16.780 --> 1:14:21.220]  You may think 2,000 plus percentage point increases in cancer is good.
[1:14:21.220 --> 1:14:25.980]  You may think all the neurological disorders and diabetes type 1, 2 and 3 off the chart.
[1:14:25.980 --> 1:14:27.180]  You may think all this is good.
[1:14:27.180 --> 1:14:36.980]  I see through it, but we have more articles today, more articles with links to new declassifications
[1:14:36.980 --> 1:14:41.300]  where plutonium was injected into people at US hospitals.
[1:14:41.300 --> 1:14:42.300]  What would happen?
[1:14:42.300 --> 1:14:46.380]  You come in with a car wreck, concussion, broken leg.
[1:14:46.380 --> 1:14:52.580]  They take you in, don't tell your family you're there, put you in a coma and start removing
[1:14:52.580 --> 1:14:57.740]  your teeth and cutting your bones out and autopsying you while you're alive.
[1:14:57.740 --> 1:15:02.220]  Only one guy, the only reason this came out because it was in police reports, was able
[1:15:02.220 --> 1:15:07.540]  to, I guess the drugs wore off, you can read the documents right now on infowars.com,
[1:15:07.540 --> 1:15:10.620]  government admits it, climb out and crawl out of the hospital.
[1:15:10.620 --> 1:15:13.300]  You're like, how did hospitals do this?
[1:15:13.300 --> 1:15:15.940]  Most big hospitals have CIA agreements.
[1:15:15.940 --> 1:15:20.580]  1968 they released a bio weapon in the subway, killed a bunch of people and had their army
[1:15:20.580 --> 1:15:25.980]  doctors in the hospitals in deals to not treat people when they came in with the unnamed
[1:15:25.980 --> 1:15:29.900]  bio weapon illness and treat them.
[1:15:29.900 --> 1:15:33.740]  But again, trust the government that's been caught shooting people up with syphilis, giving
[1:15:33.740 --> 1:15:39.860]  kids polio, giving us SV 40 over 100 million Americans, government admits, let's just trust
[1:15:39.860 --> 1:15:43.980]  them and take a vaccine and go in their naked body scanners and have potbellies, stick their
[1:15:43.980 --> 1:15:46.620]  hands down our pants.
[1:15:46.620 --> 1:15:48.780]  I mean, this is what goes on.
[1:15:48.780 --> 1:15:50.300]  This is the la-la-lancy.
[1:15:50.300 --> 1:15:53.300]  I'm not crazy.
[1:15:53.300 --> 1:16:00.780]  What I am is angry enough and primitive enough.
[1:16:00.780 --> 1:16:03.180]  I'm another of a throwback blockhead.
[1:16:03.180 --> 1:16:08.260]  That's what my grandpa would call himself, my dad's dad, and call his sons.
[1:16:08.260 --> 1:16:13.980]  He called all those oldies, Texas type folks, throwbacks, and of course throwbacks to the
[1:16:13.980 --> 1:16:18.660]  type of people that can get the job done.
[1:16:18.660 --> 1:16:24.420]  But the point is, is that I am primitive enough that all their propaganda, all their drugs,
[1:16:24.420 --> 1:16:30.220]  all their chemicals still can't cut off my lower brain function, and I can intellectually
[1:16:30.220 --> 1:16:36.500]  access info, but only because my primitive brain and my subconscious is powerful enough
[1:16:36.500 --> 1:16:38.020]  to override everything.
[1:16:38.020 --> 1:16:41.740]  And you all got that too, folks, you just got to turn it on.
[1:16:41.740 --> 1:16:44.300]  It's right there.
[1:16:44.300 --> 1:16:47.780]  In a fight they call it open in a can of, you know what?
[1:16:47.780 --> 1:16:52.300]  But in life it's called getting fired up and getting serious and getting focused, and all
[1:16:52.300 --> 1:16:53.300]  of you got it.
[1:16:53.300 --> 1:16:56.260]  There are people out there listening right now, if you just got angry and focused and
[1:16:56.260 --> 1:17:01.220]  committed to the truth, you would defeat and smash everything the New World Order has built
[1:17:01.220 --> 1:17:03.260]  very, very quickly, okay?
[1:17:03.260 --> 1:17:07.980]  Your potential has not even begun to be realized, and I need you to activate and get aggressive
[1:17:07.980 --> 1:17:08.980]  with these people.
[1:17:08.980 --> 1:17:09.980]  We've got to beat them.
[1:17:09.980 --> 1:17:11.140]  We don't have a choice.
[1:17:11.140 --> 1:17:12.540]  We've got to get motivated.
[1:17:12.540 --> 1:17:15.420]  We've got to commit and get activated against the New World Order.
[1:17:15.420 --> 1:17:16.740]  This is not a game.
[1:17:16.740 --> 1:17:17.740]  It's not a drill.
[1:17:17.740 --> 1:17:18.740]  It's not a joke.
[1:17:18.740 --> 1:17:20.380]  In fact, it's already scrolled off the main page.
[1:17:20.380 --> 1:17:24.660]  That's the one problem with infowars.com is we've got so many great writers and researchers
[1:17:24.660 --> 1:17:31.060]  that this stuff, it was another Tony Cardwell, and there's thousands of cases at least.
[1:17:31.060 --> 1:17:35.260]  The government admits, it's on the Department of Energy site, that 4,300 and something,
[1:17:35.260 --> 1:17:40.780]  I forget the exact number, 4,300 something kids, foster kids, in the 40s, 50s, and 60s,
[1:17:40.780 --> 1:17:42.900]  and of course that's all it's declassified up to.
[1:17:42.900 --> 1:17:44.500]  They keep it secret after that.
[1:17:44.500 --> 1:17:46.580]  They would take them and fry them.
[1:17:46.580 --> 1:17:50.260]  Some of them they'd partly cook, others they would hit so hard, they would be screaming
[1:17:50.260 --> 1:17:58.300]  in pain and like melted, cooked onto the radiation chamber.
[1:17:58.300 --> 1:18:02.540]  And there were descriptions of even the federal doctors who were eugenicists would complain
[1:18:02.540 --> 1:18:03.540]  about it.
[1:18:03.540 --> 1:18:05.100]  Well, it's for the greater good.
[1:18:05.100 --> 1:18:07.140]  We have to test on them in case there's a nuclear war.
[1:18:07.140 --> 1:18:08.620]  These are foster kids anyways.
[1:18:08.620 --> 1:18:15.500]  They would have gotten miskids blind, miskids deaf, bring them in, and then just, and the
[1:18:15.500 --> 1:18:20.740]  kids are like, I got to read the descriptions and, and, and crying on the thing.
[1:18:20.740 --> 1:18:22.220]  That's what the good guys did.
[1:18:22.220 --> 1:18:23.220]  It's for America.
[1:18:23.220 --> 1:18:24.220]  Yeah.
[1:18:24.220 --> 1:18:25.220]  Just playing.
[1:18:25.220 --> 1:18:27.340]  Of course, I'm just supposed to be a coward of these people and not fight them.
[1:18:27.340 --> 1:18:29.620]  They're like, people are like, well, they are murderers.
[1:18:29.620 --> 1:18:30.620]  Why are you fighting them?
[1:18:30.620 --> 1:18:35.540]  Well, I mean, a cow, if it's in a pen and it knows you're going to kill it, it's going
[1:18:35.540 --> 1:18:37.260]  to start bucking and trying to get out.
[1:18:37.260 --> 1:18:38.260]  That's a stupid cow.
[1:18:38.260 --> 1:18:43.700]  I mean, look, you don't get away from these people groveling to them or serving them.
[1:18:43.700 --> 1:18:47.140]  You get spiritual death that way and probably physical.
[1:18:47.140 --> 1:18:50.620]  The only way you get true fulfillment is going head up against these people.
[1:18:50.620 --> 1:18:53.780]  And I don't understand how that's something special, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:18:53.780 --> 1:18:59.260]  The fact that men standing up against bonafide, sickening, stinking evil.
[1:18:59.260 --> 1:19:04.260]  Best way to describe evil is the smell of rotten meat.
[1:19:04.260 --> 1:19:07.020]  Giving into that is giving into the end of who you are.
[1:19:07.020 --> 1:19:08.820]  I mean, I just will not be part of it.
[1:19:08.820 --> 1:19:10.820]  This is a no brainer decision.
[1:19:10.820 --> 1:19:11.820]  Where is that article?
[1:19:11.820 --> 1:19:12.820]  It was very powerful.
[1:19:12.820 --> 1:19:15.900]  This morning, it made me sick, even though I already actually they're saying this is
[1:19:15.900 --> 1:19:16.900]  declassified.
[1:19:16.900 --> 1:19:17.900]  It's it.
[1:19:17.900 --> 1:19:18.900]  This stuff has already been out.
[1:19:18.900 --> 1:19:21.820]  It's just this particular case.
[1:19:21.820 --> 1:19:28.460]  This particular case was it on prison planet and isn't even on info wars.com.
[1:19:28.460 --> 1:19:32.220]  This is driving me crazy.
[1:19:32.220 --> 1:19:38.060]  Hey guys, call Watson because I know it was on one of the websites like five a.m. this
[1:19:38.060 --> 1:19:41.340]  morning when I woke up and this is driving me crazy.
[1:19:41.340 --> 1:19:45.860]  Oh, here's some other stuff I just found bovine cells being added.
[1:19:45.860 --> 1:19:46.860]  I'll try.
[1:19:46.860 --> 1:19:48.220]  Look, I'm going to go to your calls.
[1:19:48.220 --> 1:19:50.780]  I promise I digressed into that.
[1:19:50.780 --> 1:19:52.540]  Guys, will you?
[1:19:52.540 --> 1:19:56.660]  There's a new article about plutonium being injected on info wars.com.
[1:19:56.660 --> 1:19:57.660]  I will.
[1:19:57.660 --> 1:19:58.660]  I'll find it.
[1:19:58.660 --> 1:19:59.660]  It doesn't matter.
[1:19:59.660 --> 1:20:00.660]  It's up there.

[1:25:28.500 --> 1:25:57.140]  Oh, man, I tell you, this is like Laurel and Hardy here.
[1:25:57.140 --> 1:26:02.780]  I am in Baton Rouge and that's why I hate electronic keys.
[1:26:02.780 --> 1:26:08.620]  We got a late checkout in this room so I could supposedly do it from the hotel and not the
[1:26:08.620 --> 1:26:11.900]  RV and have better connectivity.
[1:26:11.900 --> 1:26:17.460]  And so during the break with my pollen burst from infowarstein.com, I guess that was product
[1:26:17.460 --> 1:26:24.500]  placement, I want my B vitamins and my B pollen, it's awesome, I went out to get some ice out
[1:26:24.500 --> 1:26:29.620]  of the ice machine and I have my card and my wife and kids are out at the museum in
[1:26:29.620 --> 1:26:39.380]  places here in town and then the key isn't working and I go, oh, they must have not reactivated
[1:26:39.380 --> 1:26:43.460]  the key for late checkout, I'll go down.
[1:26:43.460 --> 1:26:50.460]  I go down, they reswipe it, come back up with plenty of time, doesn't work, and then I saw
[1:26:50.460 --> 1:26:56.500]  some manager and had to convince him that I wasn't an arch criminal trying to break in,
[1:26:56.500 --> 1:27:01.260]  had to get him to open the door and come in here and see that I said to open the door,
[1:27:01.260 --> 1:27:07.900]  you'll see radio equipment, I'm on convincing and get him in here.
[1:27:07.900 --> 1:27:11.340]  So here I am, this is driving me completely insane.
[1:27:11.340 --> 1:27:20.060]  By the way, GCN, they did send me the article, it's at infowarstein.com, it went up this morning
[1:27:20.060 --> 1:27:25.180]  and it's already scrolled off the main page, revealed US government program, secretly injected
[1:27:25.180 --> 1:27:26.180]  citizens with plutonium.
[1:27:26.180 --> 1:27:30.620]  Okay, now I'm going to start going to your calls, 15 minutes to the next hour when Salente
[1:27:30.620 --> 1:27:35.500]  joins the centers first, with that news, we'll only have time to go to one now in the short
[1:27:35.500 --> 1:27:41.220]  segment, we'll get to James, Ken and Jett and Mark and Anthony and others, toll free
[1:27:41.220 --> 1:27:47.260]  number to join us, it's 800-25-99-31, James in Texas, welcome sir, you're on the air.
[1:27:47.260 --> 1:27:55.300]  Hello there, I got a word for the propagandist, a pernicious propagandizing pornographic
[1:27:55.300 --> 1:28:24.260]  prostitutes.
[1:28:25.300 --> 1:28:48.860]  Okay folks, I think what we did is we used to go on the road and I'm just going to go
[1:28:48.860 --> 1:29:02.100]  on the road and just use Skype in the last year and it almost always worked just fine
[1:29:02.100 --> 1:29:04.340]  even when I was in rural areas.
[1:29:04.340 --> 1:29:09.860]  Now they built this really fancy box that's got all sorts of encoders and connectors to
[1:29:09.860 --> 1:29:14.420]  it and since we've been using it, it's been having problems everywhere.
[1:29:14.420 --> 1:29:21.660]  And I finally got the engineers agreeing with me that it's this box that is having the issue
[1:29:21.660 --> 1:29:26.260]  which is supposed to be a backup, but then when we start running three Wi-Fi connections
[1:29:26.260 --> 1:29:32.940]  in here, it is going to cause all sorts of problems here.
[1:29:32.940 --> 1:29:38.620]  So I'm going to try to figure this out, I need to get some help on this during the break
[1:29:38.620 --> 1:29:42.980]  and we'll be back with your calls and all this incredibly important news straight ahead.
[1:29:42.980 --> 1:29:47.540]  I'm Alex Jones, M4Worst.com is the site the system doesn't want you to read or see and

[1:32:34.180 --> 1:32:36.460]  and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[1:32:36.460 --> 1:32:39.740]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have
[1:32:39.740 --> 1:32:41.820]  to do something you've never done before.

[1:32:49.940 --> 1:33:18.100]  In 1814, we took a little trip along the Colonel Jackson down to mighty Mississippi.
[1:33:18.100 --> 1:33:22.500]  We took a little bacon, we took a little beans, and we whooped the bloody British at the town
[1:33:22.500 --> 1:33:28.020]  of New Orleans, which is just a little bit south down the old Mississippi River from
[1:33:28.020 --> 1:33:36.500]  where I'm sitting in Red Stick, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, until I like to cook in Louisiana.
[1:33:36.500 --> 1:33:42.020]  We ate breakfast down here in a little bit of the old restaurant, was full of cops at
[1:33:42.020 --> 1:33:46.660]  about 6 a.m. when I was in there eating, and I know why it was full of police, it has really
[1:33:46.660 --> 1:33:47.660]  good food.
[1:33:47.660 --> 1:33:53.660]  But if I ate good old-fashioned cooking like that every day, I'd blow back up the old
[1:33:53.660 --> 1:33:54.660]  house.
[1:33:54.660 --> 1:33:59.700]  All right, without further ado, let's now attempt to go to your phone calls and I'll
[1:33:59.700 --> 1:34:01.660]  get into these headlines.
[1:34:01.660 --> 1:34:07.060]  GSA, questioning body scanner, opt-out, globalist-pushed internet, control freak treaty of the United
[1:34:07.060 --> 1:34:08.060]  Nations.
[1:34:08.060 --> 1:34:12.500]  Ron Paul is being cheated out of the Republican nomination, counter-terrorism, and the Northern
[1:34:12.500 --> 1:34:18.140]  Border Drug Strategy tie to perimeter security deal, regulations harm small businesses and
[1:34:18.140 --> 1:34:24.540]  protect corporations, Google-caught violating browser privacy settings to track users, Adam
[1:34:24.540 --> 1:34:30.540]  Kokesh and why the media ignored the Veterans for Ron Paul rally, UKIP Nigel Farage, Greece
[1:34:30.540 --> 1:34:36.620]  being destroyed by EU, fanatical ideology, Iran holds air defense drills as IEA says
[1:34:36.620 --> 1:34:41.140]  Iran blocks access to key nuclear site, major escalation.
[1:34:41.140 --> 1:34:47.620]  Thai religious leader says anti-Iran terrorist, behind car bombs, Monsanto's BT corn to be
[1:34:47.620 --> 1:34:52.700]  sold at Walmart without markings, you're not allowed to know, that's the freedom.
[1:34:52.700 --> 1:34:58.580]  Revealed U.S. government programs secretly injected citizens with plutonium, uranium-loving
[1:34:58.580 --> 1:34:59.580]  murder.
[1:34:59.580 --> 1:35:03.500]  You ought to hear about folks being dissected live, links to the government, they want you
[1:35:03.500 --> 1:35:04.500]  to know about it.
[1:35:04.500 --> 1:35:09.500]  Nothing like dissecting you live, you have a car wreck go to local hospital, the government
[1:35:09.500 --> 1:35:15.860]  runs a secret area right outside while nurses and families are out there visiting people,
[1:35:15.860 --> 1:35:21.540]  you've got a gag in your mouth and they're chopping you up because you've been chosen
[1:35:21.540 --> 1:35:23.940]  for experimentation.
[1:35:23.940 --> 1:35:29.620]  Truth is we're all being experimented on because we're just animals according to them, continuing
[1:35:29.620 --> 1:35:34.860]  even defense contractors are supporting Ron Paul now, election 2012 just one more crafted
[1:35:34.860 --> 1:35:40.380]  illusion, minority report style advertising rolled out in London, that is just some of
[1:35:40.380 --> 1:35:41.380]  what we've got.
[1:35:41.380 --> 1:35:47.180]  But now let's try it, let's do it, this is it, James, Ken, Jet, Mark, Anthony hung
[1:35:47.180 --> 1:35:52.860]  up and then Derek, James in Texas, let's try it again, you're on the air, welcome.
[1:35:52.860 --> 1:35:54.860]  Hello there.
[1:35:54.860 --> 1:35:56.700]  Hey buddy, go ahead.
[1:35:56.700 --> 1:36:03.860]  Yeah, I got a name for the news media, pernicious propagandizing pornographic prostitutes.
[1:36:03.860 --> 1:36:11.340]  That's a good name, but again, I don't think it's bad enough, just total deceiving Satan
[1:36:11.340 --> 1:36:19.380]  worshipping minion service, I mean, I think communist pedophile services is a good name
[1:36:19.380 --> 1:36:24.140]  for the CPS, I think that's a name that might actually grasp it, I mean that's good, I'm
[1:36:24.140 --> 1:36:28.980]  not saying you're bad, I cannot come up with a name bad enough for them, traitor slime
[1:36:28.980 --> 1:36:36.220]  media, establishment bootlicking media, say yours again, I mean, it is pretty good, pernicious
[1:36:36.220 --> 1:36:45.100]  propagandizing pornographic prostitutes, yeah, triple P, I mean, traitor media, treacherous
[1:36:45.100 --> 1:36:49.100]  media, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[1:36:49.100 --> 1:36:55.060]  Global entry came in from Lima, Peru, I was down there this last week and I saw they were
[1:36:55.060 --> 1:37:01.740]  pushing that, that's kind of hooked fast and flux and TSA priest, entry and nexus.
[1:37:01.740 --> 1:37:07.700]  Yeah, they're trying to get you into the opting end of being a trusted traveler, is that what
[1:37:07.700 --> 1:37:08.700]  you're talking about?
[1:37:08.700 --> 1:37:14.020]  Yeah, the trusted traveler of the high mat, you know, the homeland.
[1:37:14.020 --> 1:37:19.060]  Which then gets you to accept for everything to be pre-approved, they're saying to have
[1:37:19.060 --> 1:37:23.660]  a credit card or have a job and they're beta testing you with the groping and the x-ray
[1:37:23.660 --> 1:37:30.180]  scanner to condition you to accept being pre-approved for travel by them, which they then turn a
[1:37:30.180 --> 1:37:34.400]  right into a privilege and that is their admitted plan where you walk through these big tunnels
[1:37:34.400 --> 1:37:39.180]  that scan you and face scan you passively, but the really trusted folks, they get to
[1:37:39.180 --> 1:37:42.060]  go all around that and just be face scanned.
[1:37:42.060 --> 1:37:47.140]  Now, did you opt in to be trusted with your North American ID card they've had out for
[1:37:47.140 --> 1:37:52.180]  four years or did you, did they pressure you to go through this and are those that are
[1:37:52.180 --> 1:37:56.980]  actually doing it being body scanned and groped still because, you know, they said when they
[1:37:56.980 --> 1:38:01.420]  go to these smart tunnels in the future, they're already testing at some airports, that still
[1:38:01.420 --> 1:38:06.460]  you'll be pulled aside sometimes and given the groping because that, that act of domination
[1:38:06.460 --> 1:38:09.540]  is important sacrament to the pedophiles.
[1:38:09.540 --> 1:38:17.300]  A hundred dollar application fee, if you, non-refundable of course, if you pass, even
[1:38:17.300 --> 1:38:25.300]  if you have a misdemeanor, you can't get the global entry, fast as a Mexican trucking influx
[1:38:25.300 --> 1:38:31.380]  is for Mexican nationals and nexus is for Canadians to come into the United States and global
[1:38:31.380 --> 1:38:37.700]  entry is for Americans and Dutch citizens are in on that too, I think that is sentry.
[1:38:37.700 --> 1:38:42.340]  Yeah, and it gets confusing, but it's all basically the same systems from what I've
[1:38:42.340 --> 1:38:45.780]  read and then for what four years or so they have those TV ads and I've seen people that
[1:38:45.780 --> 1:38:52.060]  have them, it's that national ID card that works in Canada and Mexico and it's reciprocal,
[1:38:52.060 --> 1:38:57.420]  forget the name of that, but how does that tie into this?
[1:38:57.420 --> 1:39:04.860]  I don't know, but you get, you get declined for a misdemeanor, but not for running guns
[1:39:04.860 --> 1:39:05.860]  or whatever.
[1:39:05.860 --> 1:39:11.620]  Well, that's right, you're allowed to ship guns into Mexico if you're the government
[1:39:11.620 --> 1:39:17.300]  so they ship drugs in, so again, that's another thing under Homeland Security, they're saying
[1:39:17.300 --> 1:39:20.380]  you can be on no fly list or not even get a job, you've had a misdemeanor, well, who
[1:39:20.380 --> 1:39:25.020]  doesn't have one of those, luckily, I don't think I've ever even put guilty in anything,
[1:39:25.020 --> 1:39:30.300]  so everything's been thrown out, being arrested, protesting and stuff, but did you apply for
[1:39:30.300 --> 1:39:31.300]  this?
[1:39:31.300 --> 1:39:37.540]  No, no, I didn't, I just saw the advertisement in the in-flight magazine and then I actually
[1:39:37.540 --> 1:39:43.220]  saw the first kiosk at the International Airport, Houston, coming in.
[1:39:43.220 --> 1:39:50.140]  Well, I tell you that, it was only one little kiosk out of all the other kiosks, so it looks
[1:39:50.140 --> 1:39:53.380]  like it's going to be probably expanded out in the future.
[1:39:53.380 --> 1:39:57.940]  Well, yeah, but they've got to pressure you to accept it and then they'll just add the
[1:39:57.940 --> 1:40:03.020]  groping on top of it, they've already said that, I mean, again, they never get rid of
[1:40:03.020 --> 1:40:06.620]  any of it, they just keep laying more and more on, and then all the former heads of
[1:40:06.620 --> 1:40:10.980]  Homeland Security, they all make hundreds of millions of dollars, sometimes individually,
[1:40:10.980 --> 1:40:15.420]  off of it, but the globalists are happy to give them that, because this is just all about
[1:40:15.420 --> 1:40:19.380]  total control for the megabanks, but they're all just complete insiders.
[1:40:19.380 --> 1:40:23.980]  Can you really run up my statement?
[1:40:23.980 --> 1:40:28.660]  Thank you so much, great points, James, Ken in Missouri, thanks for holding your on the
[1:40:28.660 --> 1:40:29.660]  year worldwide.
[1:40:29.660 --> 1:40:30.660]  Thank you, sir.
[1:40:30.660 --> 1:40:36.060]  I fly off a lot, my job, and last week I'm standing in an airport and I see my U.S. representative
[1:40:36.060 --> 1:40:39.820]  standing over the corner, nobody even recognized him, so I walked up and introduced myself
[1:40:39.820 --> 1:40:42.260]  and I said, sir, how do we overturn NDAA?
[1:40:42.260 --> 1:40:48.020]  I said, you outlawed a law that's been on the books since 1878, and he said, well,
[1:40:48.020 --> 1:40:52.980]  I really don't think we can, he says we tighten up language, but I don't think we can, and
[1:40:52.980 --> 1:40:57.820]  I just kind of deadpanned him on that one, I wanted other questions, so I moved on, I
[1:40:57.820 --> 1:41:02.620]  said the death ceiling is going to turn into a circus, any chance that you're not going
[1:41:02.620 --> 1:41:06.220]  to be able to just keep right on going with the death ceiling, he said no, it's going
[1:41:06.220 --> 1:41:11.500]  to keep on going up, so we talked, and I said, finally, okay, if we don't defeat Obama,
[1:41:11.500 --> 1:41:15.060]  I said I sincerely feel like this is going to be the last presidential election in the
[1:41:15.060 --> 1:41:20.700]  United States, and he just cold-eyed, he said you're probably exactly right, and I just
[1:41:20.700 --> 1:41:25.700]  took a real deep breath, I said, well, thank you for your honesty.
[1:41:25.700 --> 1:41:30.620]  Well let's stop right there, you talked to your representative at the Groping facility,
[1:41:30.620 --> 1:41:37.260]  at the Slave Training facility, I'm at airport, at the enslavement rollout training in CAT,
[1:41:37.260 --> 1:41:40.540]  and then he said you're probably right, do you want to tell us who your representative
[1:41:40.540 --> 1:41:41.540]  is?
[1:41:41.540 --> 1:41:50.940]  Well, in southwest Missouri, people can figure that out, and he's just newly elected, and
[1:41:50.940 --> 1:41:59.500]  you know, Republican, and held off a pretty good campaign, seems to be doing fairly well,
[1:41:59.500 --> 1:42:06.540]  but he's, you know, for him to come out and just say, okay, there's nothing about NDA
[1:42:06.540 --> 1:42:12.420]  that we cannot overturn, it's just, I can't pass it, why can't you un-pass it?
[1:42:12.420 --> 1:42:16.780]  Well, I'll tell you why he said that, he's been probably read the riot act that we're
[1:42:16.780 --> 1:42:21.220]  under an emergency, which the country is, but still it's illegitimate, because Congress
[1:42:21.220 --> 1:42:24.180]  is really above the president, not co-equal.
[1:42:24.180 --> 1:42:28.100]  Of the three branches, Congress is the strongest, because it has the greatest separation of
[1:42:28.100 --> 1:42:31.860]  powers, and it's the lawmaking facility.
[1:42:31.860 --> 1:42:35.340]  First they taught that when the country was founded, that it was slightly elevated above
[1:42:35.340 --> 1:42:42.140]  the others, then they taught co-equal, now they teach that the presidency comes first,
[1:42:42.140 --> 1:42:46.300]  then judicial, then legislative, which is completely backwards.
[1:42:46.300 --> 1:42:52.740]  The president executes, and is not even the commander in chief until a war is declared,
[1:42:52.740 --> 1:42:59.300]  and then in the prosecution of that war, he is a dictator, but only over the armed services,
[1:42:59.300 --> 1:43:03.540]  okay, and only over the prosecution of that war.
[1:43:03.540 --> 1:43:08.900]  But under the War Powers Act of 33 and what's been expanded out since then, remember four
[1:43:08.900 --> 1:43:15.420]  years ago, we made a big deal out of this, and Congressman talked about it, PDD 51 in
[1:43:15.420 --> 1:43:20.940]  the cover sheet said that for any emergency, including economic or unnamed emergency, the
[1:43:20.940 --> 1:43:26.100]  president can suspend Congress for six months, and then Congress can't even review it if
[1:43:26.100 --> 1:43:29.340]  the president doesn't want to in six months, that is a dictator.
[1:43:29.340 --> 1:43:32.020]  And then Congress people, the head of the Homeland Security Committee, you can just
[1:43:32.020 --> 1:43:35.540]  type this in, we wrote articles about it, there's videos on YouTube, said, I'd like
[1:43:35.540 --> 1:43:41.260]  to see that, and for six months they said no, and he said, well, I don't know what senator,
[1:43:41.260 --> 1:43:45.820]  you planning martial law or something, and we know that some of the people threatened
[1:43:45.820 --> 1:43:51.420]  that during the threats for the bank or takeover known as the bailout, no, hey, threatened martial
[1:43:51.420 --> 1:44:00.780]  law, but it doesn't matter, the cover sheet, the three-page synopsis, yes, dictatorship,
[1:44:00.780 --> 1:44:05.700]  and so they're just announcing it, so now, see Obama said, I want NDAA pass, and I want
[1:44:05.700 --> 1:44:12.060]  the power to secretly arrest whoever I want to play a warfare game, he said, I'm against
[1:44:12.060 --> 1:44:13.780]  that bill, take that out.
[1:44:13.780 --> 1:44:17.140]  All behind the scenes saying, I'll veto it if you don't put it in, then they pass it
[1:44:17.140 --> 1:44:21.500]  with that in, he says, don't worry, I'll veto it, so people hear that, then he goes ahead
[1:44:21.500 --> 1:44:30.260]  and signs it on December 31st at six o'clock at night, Hawaii time, almost midnight here,
[1:44:30.260 --> 1:44:36.060]  show that no one is even aware of it, and so I have debates with people, they say, Obama,
[1:44:36.060 --> 1:44:40.940]  he's not for that, don't you lie about him, you dirty Republican scumbag, it's the same
[1:44:40.940 --> 1:44:45.260]  thing people say to me, I don't want to hear you again say that George W. Bush was against
[1:44:45.260 --> 1:44:50.860]  the, you know, was for the assault weapons ban, I told the story of a guy, McBrides walked
[1:44:50.860 --> 1:44:55.100]  over to work there, he was like, he didn't get to me, but he looked at me, he said, you
[1:44:55.100 --> 1:44:59.180]  know, Alex, I hear your show, I don't like you lying about Bush saying he was for the
[1:44:59.180 --> 1:45:03.980]  assault weapons ban, I was like, but he is, and then one of the owners, because I recognized
[1:45:03.980 --> 1:45:11.340]  him, went, no, Bob or Bill, whatever his name was, he is, and they're like, oh, oh, again,
[1:45:11.340 --> 1:45:15.700]  it's like, it's like Obama didn't do that, Bush didn't do that, it's all part of their
[1:45:15.700 --> 1:45:21.620]  military op of just deception, when the tanks were ramming Waco machine gunning people with
[1:45:21.620 --> 1:45:26.260]  the flare footage of the infantry behind it in a tank maneuver shooting, the government
[1:45:26.260 --> 1:45:30.860]  said that those are not men shooting, you can see them in clear black and white, and
[1:45:30.860 --> 1:45:35.620]  this is not an assault, and they were broadcasting, come out with your hands up, it's not an assault,
[1:45:35.620 --> 1:45:43.940]  and so Obama says, I didn't, I didn't, I'm not for the NDAA, and Bush didn't forgot
[1:45:43.940 --> 1:45:48.580]  control, he just pushed us for it, I'm sorry, go ahead, well, and I traveled a lot, I talked
[1:45:48.580 --> 1:45:52.700]  to a lot of people, gotta, gotta, gotta, eight out of 10 people don't even know what we just
[1:45:52.700 --> 1:45:58.740]  talked about, and then that's the most concerning thing, that's combined with the Patriot Act,
[1:45:58.740 --> 1:46:05.980]  and then the Obamacare, this is not America anymore, and for my kids, and my grandkids,
[1:46:05.980 --> 1:46:14.620]  you just, you just have to just, Lord, let us pray a little bit harder here, but I'm,
[1:46:14.620 --> 1:46:19.340]  I'm not seeing people wake up like I wish they could, and you gotta fight the fight,
[1:46:19.340 --> 1:46:20.340]  but wow.
[1:46:20.340 --> 1:46:27.580]  Well, here's the deal, it varies which area you're in, or who you tend to run into, some
[1:46:27.580 --> 1:46:33.140]  areas you find 60, 70% are awake, some places 5%, but every number, and every globalist
[1:46:33.140 --> 1:46:37.540]  internal document that gets leaked, or that's for more scholarly publication that they don't
[1:46:37.540 --> 1:46:42.380]  consider the public, even privy to, even though it's public, they say the elite's in trouble,
[1:46:42.380 --> 1:46:48.180]  and their actuaries show that there's a huge awakening, and so they're batting down the
[1:46:48.180 --> 1:46:53.460]  hatches to try to suppress us, remember, 3% started the war against the Red Codes when
[1:46:53.460 --> 1:46:58.220]  they kept pushing, or fought back, the Red Codes actually started the war, 5% won the
[1:46:58.220 --> 1:47:04.220]  war, so it's always 5% that, that decide things, and the globalists are less than one-tenth
[1:47:04.220 --> 1:47:10.060]  of 1%, and I guarantee you, we got about 25% that are really starting to get it, we got
[1:47:10.060 --> 1:47:15.340]  10% that are really hardcore awake, 30%, 40% that are somewhat awake, but you're right,
[1:47:15.340 --> 1:47:21.580]  I'd say on average about 65% of people, they know all about Sports Center, all about LeBron
[1:47:21.580 --> 1:47:28.700]  James, and all about, you know, Tebow or whatever, and that's fine, it's just, I wish they knew
[1:47:28.700 --> 1:47:34.340]  about Socialist Healthcare, World Government, and even the NRA coming out last week, and
[1:47:34.340 --> 1:47:41.660]  this is confirmed now, it's not just me saying it, Obama does plan to use Fiat ATF edicts
[1:47:41.660 --> 1:47:47.940]  to ban semi-autos next year, so it's on, and listen, the cops will come, and we'll
[1:47:47.940 --> 1:47:52.180]  swat team your house, and we'll try to make an example out of you, to scare everybody
[1:47:52.180 --> 1:47:55.900]  to turn their guns in, they're going to do it, and I want people to understand, and I
[1:47:55.900 --> 1:48:01.020]  want the police to understand, if one-one-hundredth of gun owners out of 200 million stand up,
[1:48:01.020 --> 1:48:05.180]  that's now 2 million people that are going to fight you, and that's going to be a civil
[1:48:05.180 --> 1:48:10.460]  war, all because a bunch of globalist trader criminals gave you orders that were illegal,
[1:48:10.460 --> 1:48:15.100]  don't follow them, I'm not some macho guy that wants to see a bunch of dead cops, how
[1:48:15.100 --> 1:48:21.500]  about we just don't go along with this, if that's what's ordered, God bless you and
[1:48:21.500 --> 1:48:25.880]  I appreciate your call, even dumbbells are more awake than they were, but look, some
[1:48:25.880 --> 1:48:30.540]  suckin' dumbbells, for whatever reason, I'll bet you money their ancestors weren't involved
[1:48:30.540 --> 1:48:36.060]  either, you know, a lot of this is about bloodlines and families, I don't care what color you
[1:48:36.060 --> 1:48:40.380]  are, but everybody knows certain families, certain people stand up, other people have
[1:48:40.380 --> 1:48:45.700]  always been followers that sit in the ditch, it's up to us to lead them, okay, we've got
[1:48:45.700 --> 1:48:50.220]  the truth, the enemy's got the lies, all we need is courage, we win, period, you just
[1:48:50.220 --> 1:48:54.940]  gotta have the will, we'll win, let's go ahead, and I mean we'll win the first fight
[1:48:54.940 --> 1:49:00.740]  either, we just gotta persevere, let's go to a Jett in Canada, then Mark, Derek and
[1:49:00.740 --> 1:49:07.100]  John, Jett, thanks for holding, welcome, hi Alex, I'm a first time caller, and I'm calling
[1:49:07.100 --> 1:49:13.900]  you about some of the things the previous guy had just talked about, I think Ron Paul
[1:49:13.900 --> 1:49:20.780]  is the only hope for America, and I hope that American people can get up and start to get
[1:49:20.780 --> 1:49:27.980]  their message out, make some YouTube videos, there's a spot on the internet called Blog
[1:49:27.980 --> 1:49:35.260]  TV, it's live TV, you can be on there for as long as you want, for free, and start talking
[1:49:35.260 --> 1:49:43.020]  about this NDAA and the dangers that come from that.
[1:49:43.020 --> 1:49:49.700]  You're right, and people again, don't just think as Alex Jones is covering something
[1:49:49.700 --> 1:49:54.820]  that it's now been told, the power is when you tell it, whether it's to 10 people or
[1:49:54.820 --> 1:50:00.460]  100, get an access show, do a website, do a local paper, do a local blur, make copies
[1:50:00.460 --> 1:50:14.620]  of films, get active, and then we'd have success, be back in 10, anything else Jett?
[1:50:14.620 --> 1:50:21.620]  You can be on there as long as you want, and I'm a former American, and I left America
[1:50:21.620 --> 1:50:28.540]  right when Obama was running for election, because I knew what was coming, and I love
[1:50:28.540 --> 1:50:34.300]  America, but I will never step foot back in that country as long as he's there, and that's
[1:50:34.300 --> 1:50:35.300]  a shame.
[1:50:35.300 --> 1:50:36.300]  It's a shame.
[1:50:36.300 --> 1:50:37.300]  Where have you moved to?
[1:50:37.300 --> 1:50:38.300]  Say what?
[1:50:38.300 --> 1:50:43.180]  Stay there, I want to ask you where you moved to, I'm just interested, because it's admitted
[1:50:43.180 --> 1:50:47.620]  the greatest exodus out of the United States that's ever happened is happening, and it's
[1:50:47.620 --> 1:50:52.100]  mainly the wealthy and ultra rich, they are running so fast, they've done a great job
[1:50:52.100 --> 1:50:59.180]  ruining the country, and selling us out, and strolling the nest, just great jobs, great
[1:50:59.180 --> 1:51:00.180]  job ruining America.
[1:51:00.180 --> 1:51:03.100]  I want to hear more from the caller where they've run to.
[1:51:03.100 --> 1:51:08.540]  Brought to me to tell you that humanity is in a deep crisis, everyone can feel it.
[1:51:08.540 --> 1:51:14.180]  We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place between the forces of freedom, and those
[1:51:14.180 --> 1:51:17.340]  who love darkness, bondage, and enslavement.
[1:51:17.340 --> 1:51:24.780]  Yes my friends, evil is rising, but take heart for every action there is an equal and opposite
[1:51:24.780 --> 1:51:25.780]  reaction.
[1:51:25.780 --> 1:51:30.180]  Recently, New World Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the info
[1:51:30.180 --> 1:51:31.180]  war.
[1:51:31.180 --> 1:51:34.940]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[1:51:34.940 --> 1:51:41.820]  The globalists are scared, they've overreached, the future of the info war is in your hands.
[1:51:41.820 --> 1:51:47.980]  In prisonplanet.tv, download the thousands of special video reports, ebooks, and more,
[1:51:47.980 --> 1:51:50.300]  and get them out to everyone you know.
[1:51:50.300 --> 1:51:54.820]  Continue to spread the word about the broadcast on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and every other
[1:51:54.820 --> 1:51:56.900]  globalist propaganda platform.
[1:51:56.900 --> 1:51:59.180]  We are going to use their system against them.
[1:51:59.180 --> 1:52:02.660]  The info war now goes into high gear.
[1:52:02.660 --> 1:52:06.820]  Do you know which 37 crucial food items are going to fly off the shelves when the next
[1:52:06.820 --> 1:52:07.820]  disaster hits?
[1:52:07.820 --> 1:52:12.740]  If you don't, you and your family may be without food and waiting in long food lines after
[1:52:12.740 --> 1:52:14.420]  a big disaster strikes.
[1:52:14.420 --> 1:52:18.620]  You would be surprised how many people don't have these food items right now.
[1:52:18.620 --> 1:52:24.580]  123survivalplan.com has set up a for patriots only video with inside information on the
[1:52:24.580 --> 1:52:28.860]  37 food items that will sell out first when the next disaster strikes.

[1:52:34.900 --> 1:52:38.140]  for any disaster, natural, or man-made.
[1:52:38.140 --> 1:52:42.980]  And you won't have to be afraid of going hungry for being sent to a FEMA refugee camp.
[1:52:42.980 --> 1:52:47.380]  See the video that over one million other smart patriots have already seen in the last
[1:52:47.380 --> 1:52:48.380]  four months.

[1:56:51.620 --> 1:57:08.620]  Okay, we're going to go to Mark in Utah, John in Georgia, Scott.
[1:57:08.620 --> 1:57:22.620]  Music.
[1:57:22.620 --> 1:57:28.620]  In constant sorrow of his day.
[1:57:28.620 --> 1:57:42.620]  I am the man of constant sorrow. I've seen trouble all my days.
[1:57:42.620 --> 1:57:50.620]  I'm a bit farewell to old Kentucky.
[1:57:50.620 --> 1:58:06.620]  The place where I was born and raised.
[1:58:06.620 --> 1:58:10.620]  Okay folks, we had another one of those little hiccups.
[1:58:10.620 --> 1:58:15.620]  I've never had this happen on the road. This might be the end of me going on the road, whatever's going on here.
[1:58:15.620 --> 1:58:20.620]  Whatever reason it is, I thought the road was getting good enough to be able to do this.
[1:58:20.620 --> 1:58:25.620]  Whether it's just where we happen to be every day or whether it's the new things we've done.
[1:58:25.620 --> 1:58:29.620]  I'm just tempted to go right back to just good old fashioned skype the way we were doing it.
[1:58:29.620 --> 1:58:32.620]  Everywhere that worked good, a few cutouts here and there.
[1:58:32.620 --> 1:58:38.620]  But again, more of your phone calls coming up and then Gerald Salente is going to be joining us.
[1:58:38.620 --> 1:58:42.620]  Don't forget, we've got 15 day free trials at prisonblinded.tv.
[1:58:42.620 --> 1:58:51.620]  You are listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:58:51.620 --> 1:58:59.620]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty good sized meal that I was still starving.
[1:58:59.620 --> 1:59:05.620]  And my research led me to a well known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States
[1:59:05.620 --> 1:59:12.620]  and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements
[1:59:12.620 --> 1:59:17.620]  that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer and be healthy.
[1:59:17.620 --> 1:59:23.620]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity.
[1:59:23.620 --> 1:59:27.620]  The Young Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need.
[1:59:27.620 --> 1:59:31.620]  And once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.

[1:59:37.620 --> 1:59:39.620]  Check it out for yourself, it's incredible.
[1:59:39.620 --> 1:59:45.620]  Go to InfowarsTeam.com today and order your first canister of Beyond Tangy Tangerine
[1:59:45.620 --> 2:00:01.620]  complete multivitamin mineral complex dietary supplement that's InfowarsTeam.com
[2:00:15.620 --> 2:00:30.620]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:30.620 --> 2:00:33.620]  Okay, we are now into hour number three.
[2:00:33.620 --> 2:00:36.620]  I am on the road from Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
[2:00:36.620 --> 2:00:39.620]  We have Gerald Salente always in formative joining us.
[2:00:39.620 --> 2:00:42.620]  Let's go back to your phone calls right now.
[2:00:42.620 --> 2:00:45.620]  Mark in Utah, welcome, sir.
[2:00:45.620 --> 2:00:47.620]  Hi, Alex. How are you?
[2:00:47.620 --> 2:00:48.620]  Good, sir.
[2:00:48.620 --> 2:00:49.620]  Can you hear me okay?
[2:00:49.620 --> 2:00:52.620]  Yes, I can. Thank you.
[2:00:52.620 --> 2:00:53.620]  Okay.
[2:00:53.620 --> 2:00:58.620]  Hey, I just heard the segment with Mankowski, you know, the church.
[2:00:58.620 --> 2:01:01.620]  The church he describes already says it's back in mid-Romney.
[2:01:01.620 --> 2:01:02.620]  I can't find any proof of that.
[2:01:02.620 --> 2:01:03.620]  I'm a member of the church.
[2:01:03.620 --> 2:01:08.620]  I've been so since I'm 19 and I'm 47 now.
[2:01:08.620 --> 2:01:14.620]  The church, everything I'm reading the scriptures that they have are just total anti-neural order.
[2:01:14.620 --> 2:01:18.620]  I mean, they even go on to say that the constitution was inspired by God,
[2:01:18.620 --> 2:01:21.620]  that the Chinese fathers were raised up to bring forth this document.
[2:01:21.620 --> 2:01:23.620]  It's a great document.
[2:01:23.620 --> 2:01:27.620]  They even, in the Book of Mormon, they even talk about the secret combinations
[2:01:27.620 --> 2:01:31.620]  on how they destroy whole civilizations in ancient America.
[2:01:31.620 --> 2:01:36.620]  And they talk about the importance of warning others of these secret combinations.
[2:01:36.620 --> 2:01:41.620]  And it just goes on and on how church is very anti-neural order.
[2:01:41.620 --> 2:01:44.620]  They even tell you to fight against the church of the devil.
[2:01:44.620 --> 2:01:46.620]  I mean, it's pretty clear.
[2:01:46.620 --> 2:01:48.620]  Yeah, I've got to be honest.
[2:01:48.620 --> 2:01:49.620]  I mean, I've got to be honest.
[2:01:49.620 --> 2:01:53.620]  I'm not really, I couldn't even say an expert on Mormons,
[2:01:53.620 --> 2:01:56.620]  but I just know that as far as my listeners go,
[2:01:56.620 --> 2:02:00.620]  a disproportionate amount, what Mormons are less than 1% of the population,
[2:02:00.620 --> 2:02:03.620]  and I'd say maybe 5% or more of my audience are Mormons,
[2:02:03.620 --> 2:02:08.620]  and they all seem to be anti-neural order and seem to know what's going on more than most people.
[2:02:08.620 --> 2:02:09.620]  That's what I'm saying.
[2:02:09.620 --> 2:02:12.620]  Then you got Mitt Romney, who's this big new world order guy,
[2:02:12.620 --> 2:02:15.620]  and they're saying that the Mormon church is supporting him,
[2:02:15.620 --> 2:02:19.620]  but I don't know any Mormon listeners of my show that are supporting him.
[2:02:19.620 --> 2:02:21.620]  They seem to all be supporting Ron Paul,
[2:02:21.620 --> 2:02:24.620]  but I don't know anybody else that's supporting Mitt Romney.
[2:02:24.620 --> 2:02:30.620]  I mean, is anybody seeing Mitt Romney bumper stickers or signs that aren't put up by the campaign?
[2:02:30.620 --> 2:02:34.620]  I mean, again, I'm calling all of this as a hoax.
[2:02:34.620 --> 2:02:38.620]  Well, in here, you can see Mitt Romney's stickers,
[2:02:38.620 --> 2:02:43.620]  because a lot of people believe that he's going to be this great Mormon president.
[2:02:43.620 --> 2:02:48.620]  But what they don't realize, he's financed by all the major industries,
[2:02:48.620 --> 2:02:51.620]  the military industrial complex, the pharmaceutical industrial complex,
[2:02:51.620 --> 2:02:56.620]  the banking industry, and these people don't understand the concept of fascism
[2:02:56.620 --> 2:03:00.620]  and shows like yours are helping people wake up,
[2:03:00.620 --> 2:03:03.620]  but there are a lot of people that are drinking the floor.
[2:03:03.620 --> 2:03:05.620]  They're just not figuring this stuff out.
[2:03:05.620 --> 2:03:08.620]  But we are warning people and people are waking up,
[2:03:08.620 --> 2:03:10.620]  but just like the rest of the world,
[2:03:10.620 --> 2:03:14.620]  a lot of people that have eyes that they're not open, they have ears that they're not hearing.
[2:03:14.620 --> 2:03:18.620]  Well, I mean, it's probably also kind of like a lot of black folks voted for Obama.
[2:03:18.620 --> 2:03:21.620]  Like a lot of movie, black movie stars have said,
[2:03:21.620 --> 2:03:25.620]  just another guy last week came out and said,
[2:03:25.620 --> 2:03:27.620]  hey, I voted for Obama because he's black.
[2:03:27.620 --> 2:03:30.620]  I don't care what he does. He's black. I'm voting for him again.
[2:03:30.620 --> 2:03:32.620]  And that's like, wow.
[2:03:32.620 --> 2:03:34.620]  So vote for him because he's Mormon,
[2:03:34.620 --> 2:03:37.620]  or vote for somebody because they're Catholic and you're Catholic,
[2:03:37.620 --> 2:03:40.620]  or vote somebody because they're Muslim and you're a Muslim.
[2:03:40.620 --> 2:03:44.620]  You got to vote for somebody for what they stand for and what they've done,
[2:03:44.620 --> 2:03:46.620]  not what color they are.
[2:03:46.620 --> 2:03:50.620]  I mean, I would vote for a black Ron Paul in a second.
[2:03:50.620 --> 2:03:53.620]  I would vote for Hispanic Ron Paul in a millisecond.
[2:03:53.620 --> 2:03:56.620]  I would vote for an Asian Ron Paul in a second.
[2:03:56.620 --> 2:03:59.620]  I would vote for a white Ron Paul in a second.
[2:03:59.620 --> 2:04:02.620]  It's about a history of doing what you say you're going to do.
[2:04:02.620 --> 2:04:07.620]  Even if I didn't agree with Ron Paul on every issue, which I do, 99.9%.
[2:04:07.620 --> 2:04:11.620]  The fact, if I agree with him on 90% of stuff, but he was always consistent,
[2:04:11.620 --> 2:04:16.620]  it's the consistency is almost even better than just the fact that he's right on his issues
[2:04:16.620 --> 2:04:20.620]  because you know that he's going to do what he says he's going to do.
[2:04:20.620 --> 2:04:25.620]  That's what has value is the sureness. Do you see what I'm saying?
[2:04:25.620 --> 2:04:28.620]  Yes, yes, and I totally agree with you.
[2:04:28.620 --> 2:04:32.620]  I love your show. You helped me wake up six years ago
[2:04:32.620 --> 2:04:36.620]  and I've been telling people about your show ever since
[2:04:36.620 --> 2:04:38.620]  and I've woken up a ton of people.
[2:04:38.620 --> 2:04:42.620]  What woke me up was, you know, there's a warrant error, why are the doors wide open
[2:04:42.620 --> 2:04:46.620]  and I'm so grateful to have come across your show
[2:04:46.620 --> 2:04:49.620]  and I've spread it to so many people and I just love it.
[2:04:49.620 --> 2:04:52.620]  Well, thank you so much. Good to hear from you, Mark.
[2:04:52.620 --> 2:04:55.620]  All right, we got Salente coming up like six, seven minutes after we come back
[2:04:55.620 --> 2:04:59.620]  so I'm going to try to jam in John, Scott, Joseph and Walter all together
[2:04:59.620 --> 2:05:20.620]  and we'll get to all of you straight ahead. Stay with us.
[2:05:29.620 --> 2:05:32.620]  For you and your family.
[2:06:00.620 --> 2:06:06.620]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system
[2:06:06.620 --> 2:06:09.620]  with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions,
[2:06:09.620 --> 2:06:12.620]  yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System
[2:06:12.620 --> 2:06:17.620]  and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[2:06:17.620 --> 2:06:22.620]  My name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[2:06:22.620 --> 2:06:27.620]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions,
[2:06:27.620 --> 2:06:31.620]  it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed
[2:06:31.620 --> 2:06:35.620]  to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[2:06:35.620 --> 2:06:43.620]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin and orally for the digestive system.
[2:06:43.620 --> 2:06:47.620]  Be sure to watch our new seven-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System
[2:06:47.620 --> 2:06:53.620]  at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[2:06:53.620 --> 2:06:57.620]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[2:06:57.620 --> 2:07:24.620]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[2:07:27.620 --> 2:07:34.620]  We are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[2:07:57.620 --> 2:08:26.620]  All right, we are back live. We're getting Gerald Salente on with us here in about six or seven minutes from now.
[2:08:26.620 --> 2:08:34.620]  I want to jam in some more calls before we go to him here in just a second.
[2:08:34.620 --> 2:08:43.620]  But first, I do want to tell listeners that not only are these great products and absolutely amazing services,
[2:08:43.620 --> 2:08:54.620]  your purchase and support of them also makes the overall radio show, the news websites, the films, all of it possible.
[2:08:54.620 --> 2:09:05.620]  So again, expanding on that, we have PrisonPlanet.tv and 15-day free trials that we're continuing to run to see the nightly news,
[2:09:05.620 --> 2:09:14.620]  to see the radio show, not just hear it, all of my films, so many other documentaries and films.
[2:09:14.620 --> 2:09:21.620]  Nine years of work, it will be in April, all at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[2:09:21.620 --> 2:09:25.620]  Also live, we're on the radio and then, of course, the nightly news.
[2:09:25.620 --> 2:09:29.620]  PrisonPlanet.tv, 15-day free trials.
[2:09:29.620 --> 2:09:34.620]  And then we also have ImpleWarsTeam.com, so I've lost more than 37 pounds in three months.
[2:09:34.620 --> 2:09:41.620]  The Tangy Tangerine with the 90 essential minerals, the 90-90, and the key vitamins,
[2:09:41.620 --> 2:09:44.620]  all in just a couple scoops a day and your water tastes great.
[2:09:44.620 --> 2:09:50.620]  The Polymers and, of course, the Rebound and hundreds of other products, those are the ones I really love.
[2:09:50.620 --> 2:09:53.620]  They're all available at ImpleWarsTeam.com.
[2:09:53.620 --> 2:09:55.620]  You can become a distributor and sign up today.
[2:09:55.620 --> 2:09:59.620]  I know because I'm on the road and on via Skype.
[2:09:59.620 --> 2:10:02.620]  We've got a few glitches today and I apologize for that, but overall it's been great.
[2:10:02.620 --> 2:10:05.620]  Great job to the crew as we try to tweak all this.
[2:10:05.620 --> 2:10:11.620]  But I will say that since we went to another system five minutes ago, so we can get Gerald Salente on via Skype as well,
[2:10:11.620 --> 2:10:20.620]  I may not be able to do it because I'm getting incredible feedback and basically submarine noises and Cylon Raiders invading sounds.
[2:10:20.620 --> 2:10:23.620]  This is actually pretty cool for like a video game or something.
[2:10:23.620 --> 2:10:25.620]  It would be, but it's like...
[2:10:31.620 --> 2:10:33.620]  So I can handle this while I take callers.
[2:10:33.620 --> 2:10:35.620]  I can handle this noise.
[2:10:35.620 --> 2:10:39.620]  I just want to make sure that's not going out over air.
[2:10:39.620 --> 2:10:42.620]  Okay, and then when you talk to me, it's unintelligible.
[2:10:42.620 --> 2:10:44.620]  It's like a Cylon Raider.
[2:10:44.620 --> 2:10:45.620]  But I like this.
[2:10:45.620 --> 2:10:47.620]  I love all the new fancy equipment.
[2:10:47.620 --> 2:10:49.620]  It's like a Cylon Raiders that we're attacking from Mars.
[2:10:49.620 --> 2:10:51.620]  Good old fashioned Skype.
[2:10:51.620 --> 2:10:54.620]  We can have another Skype guest up, but anyways, let's go ahead.
[2:10:54.620 --> 2:10:55.620]  Oh, it's gone.
[2:10:55.620 --> 2:10:57.620]  The Cylon Raiders are gone.
[2:10:57.620 --> 2:10:59.620]  All right.
[2:10:59.620 --> 2:11:01.620]  Let's go back to the calls here.
[2:11:01.620 --> 2:11:04.620]  Let's go to John in Georgia.
[2:11:04.620 --> 2:11:06.620]  John, thanks for holding welcome.
[2:11:06.620 --> 2:11:08.620]  How are you doing today?
[2:11:08.620 --> 2:11:09.620]  Good.
[2:11:09.620 --> 2:11:10.620]  Awesome.
[2:11:10.620 --> 2:11:13.620]  I have like two things I wanted to tell you about.
[2:11:13.620 --> 2:11:21.620]  One, I'm a delegate for Ron Paul for precinct six of delegate district nine in Georgia.
[2:11:21.620 --> 2:11:28.620]  And the outcome that we had for support of Ron Paul at the delegate mass precinct meeting was massive.
[2:11:28.620 --> 2:11:34.620]  There were all types of people from everywhere supporting Ron Paul.
[2:11:34.620 --> 2:11:41.620]  Even when Newt Gingrich came in and gave a speech, Herman Cain was there to introduce him.
[2:11:41.620 --> 2:11:52.620]  And all the trendies that you talk about that were supporting Ron Paul for the media to cover and like, oh, look at all the Newt Gingrich supporters.
[2:11:52.620 --> 2:12:00.620]  They all left directly after, directly before the mass precinct meeting and directly before we got to choose all the delegates.
[2:12:00.620 --> 2:12:05.620]  Ron Paul is winning Georgia as of right now. It's amazing.
[2:12:05.620 --> 2:12:09.620]  Well, that's right because it's really about the delegate process.
[2:12:09.620 --> 2:12:16.620]  So the system's cheating Ron Paul in the votes, but he's just going ahead and taking the delegates and they're talking about a broken convention.
[2:12:16.620 --> 2:12:19.620]  The system is really freaked out by this.
[2:12:19.620 --> 2:12:20.620]  Yeah.
[2:12:20.620 --> 2:12:24.620]  And there's something else I want to talk about when I wrecked my truck about a month ago.
[2:12:24.620 --> 2:12:30.620]  It was in the middle of the night and there were SWAT teams that came by in a tank.
[2:12:30.620 --> 2:12:33.620]  And I lived in the middle of rural Georgia.
[2:12:33.620 --> 2:12:35.620]  And when I asked them, I was like, what are you guys doing?
[2:12:35.620 --> 2:12:37.620]  You know, this is, that's a, that's a tank.
[2:12:37.620 --> 2:12:40.620]  And they were like, well, we're training exercises.
[2:12:40.620 --> 2:12:42.620]  And I was like, what are you training for war?
[2:12:42.620 --> 2:12:45.620]  And they all laughed and kind of, you know, didn't pay any attention to me.
[2:12:45.620 --> 2:12:48.620]  But I was like, no, really, what are you training for war?
[2:12:48.620 --> 2:12:51.620]  Because I've been listening to your show for like three years now.
[2:12:51.620 --> 2:12:54.620]  And I knew exactly what they were training for, they're preparing to take.
[2:12:54.620 --> 2:12:55.620]  Yeah.
[2:12:55.620 --> 2:13:01.620]  No, what's going on is they're trying to make the police feel basically federalized and feel invincible.
[2:13:01.620 --> 2:13:03.620]  And it's about intimidation of the public.
[2:13:03.620 --> 2:13:07.620]  They've had police chiefs admit the black uniforms, the ski mask are all for that.
[2:13:07.620 --> 2:13:14.620]  And they are trained to take on refused nicks, people that don't turn their farms and ranches over when the property tax, you know, gets tripled.
[2:13:14.620 --> 2:13:17.620]  People that, you know, are going to be forced off their land.
[2:13:17.620 --> 2:13:20.620]  And they're training with an iron fist to attack rural areas.
[2:13:20.620 --> 2:13:30.620]  The thing is, if it ever goes a civil war, people aren't going to wait for the armored vehicle, you know, the marine fighting vehicle, the, you know, the warrior vehicle or the Bradley to show up.
[2:13:30.620 --> 2:13:34.620]  People are going to go out and find people that work for the system.
[2:13:34.620 --> 2:13:37.620]  And so that needs to be understood.
[2:13:37.620 --> 2:13:42.620]  We're not just going to wait for you to come firebomb our house and, you know, send in your combat robot or whatever it is.
[2:13:42.620 --> 2:13:44.620]  It's not going to work that way.
[2:13:44.620 --> 2:13:51.620]  Oh, yeah, they're trying to hype the cops up, you know, to feel invincible and, you know, festoon themselves in body armor suits and the rest of it.
[2:13:51.620 --> 2:13:54.620]  And nothing can stop initiative.
[2:13:54.620 --> 2:14:00.620]  And no amount of robots or any of it's going to stop anybody if this goes to civil war, other than their super bio weapons.
[2:14:00.620 --> 2:14:05.620]  And then that kills most people above ground.
[2:14:05.620 --> 2:14:09.620]  Out of ground, later, whoever survives, he's remembered, it's the globalist that did it.
[2:14:09.620 --> 2:14:11.620]  Anything else, sir?
[2:14:11.620 --> 2:14:14.620]  Thank you very much for doing your radio show and all of your TV.
[2:14:14.620 --> 2:14:17.620]  And we're really, really supporting you here in Georgia.
[2:14:17.620 --> 2:14:19.620]  Just giving a shout out to you.
[2:14:19.620 --> 2:14:20.620]  Thank you very much.
[2:14:20.620 --> 2:14:22.620]  Well, God bless you, my friend.
[2:14:22.620 --> 2:14:27.620]  Folks, should I go to another caller before we go to Solente?
[2:14:27.620 --> 2:14:29.620]  Okay, thank you.
[2:14:29.620 --> 2:14:30.620]  It was kind of cool now.
[2:14:30.620 --> 2:14:33.620]  Now I complained about the Cylon Raider thing and now I kind of liked it.
[2:14:33.620 --> 2:14:34.620]  It's like awesome sounds.
[2:14:34.620 --> 2:14:36.620]  You know that sonar sound?
[2:14:36.620 --> 2:14:39.620]  It was that sound with like all sorts of other stuff.
[2:14:39.620 --> 2:14:46.620]  I don't know how computers make such cool noises, but it's like whatever language these things have got, it's like really weird.
[2:14:46.620 --> 2:14:52.620]  Let's go ahead and talk to actually all these crazy scrups.
[2:14:52.620 --> 2:14:54.620]  They've kind of been entertaining for me.
[2:14:54.620 --> 2:14:55.620]  I was entertaining for the audience.
[2:14:55.620 --> 2:14:57.620]  We're beta testing stuff.
[2:14:57.620 --> 2:14:58.620]  It's like NASA here.
[2:14:58.620 --> 2:15:00.620]  Let's talk to Scott in Texas.
[2:15:00.620 --> 2:15:01.620]  Scott, you're on the air.
[2:15:01.620 --> 2:15:02.620]  Go ahead.
[2:15:02.620 --> 2:15:03.620]  Hey, Alex.
[2:15:03.620 --> 2:15:14.620]  Yeah, real quick, it seems odd to me that Iran and the other nations that are on the hit list would just sit back and wait to be annihilated by the U.S. military.
[2:15:14.620 --> 2:15:25.620]  It seems to me like they would be going after these banking families with their intelligence agencies to try to prevent what they're doing behind, you know, behind closed doors.
[2:15:25.620 --> 2:15:27.620]  Well, you know who founded the CIA.
[2:15:27.620 --> 2:15:31.620]  It's who founded the OSS for the Bretts in 1947.
[2:15:31.620 --> 2:15:32.620]  It's on record.
[2:15:32.620 --> 2:15:43.620]  I mean, they even made historical films like The Good Shepherd put out by Robert De Niro, where the CIA is set up from top to mid-level by skull and bones people.
[2:15:43.620 --> 2:15:56.620]  And then that set up the other 15 agencies, and it's all from Yale and Harvard and Princeton, and they're all sent to get road scholarships and be taught by British intelligence, and they're funded by the Rothschilds and others.
[2:15:56.620 --> 2:16:05.620]  And so all these agencies are run by the dub smuggling, you know, globalists, the British East India Company, skull and bones got set up by that.
[2:16:05.620 --> 2:16:12.620]  And so at the top, and they operate with total secrecy, and they put in hit men and people below them, and they just operate.
[2:16:12.620 --> 2:16:18.620]  So that's why, despite all that, we've had the last two Joint Chiefs of State.
[2:16:18.620 --> 2:16:26.620]  And before that, the head of CENTCOM say no to an Iran attack, and no to Cheney attacking our own ships.
[2:16:26.620 --> 2:16:32.620]  You know, Ray McGovern, when he said, look for them to stay just straight on our mooch with fake patrol boats attacking our ships.
[2:16:32.620 --> 2:16:38.620]  And then it turned out right as he was saying that three years later, Cy Hirsch writes about White House sources with the exact thing.
[2:16:38.620 --> 2:16:41.620]  And of course, McGovern's like, oh, I'm just guessing that's it.
[2:16:41.620 --> 2:16:48.620]  And a real former top CIA analyst like he was Reagan and Bush will always say, oh, it's just my hunch, he has sources, folks.
[2:16:48.620 --> 2:16:50.620]  But it did come out that that was the whole plan.
[2:16:50.620 --> 2:16:55.620]  So the military did say, and the Navy SEALs did say, no, we're not going to go up and attack our own ship.
[2:16:55.620 --> 2:16:59.620]  They're like, oh, just shoot some rockets at it, it'll be all right.
[2:16:59.620 --> 2:17:02.620]  You know, the hull is strong enough to take them.
[2:17:02.620 --> 2:17:05.620]  And they're like, well, what if we get blown away by the ship?
[2:17:05.620 --> 2:17:06.620]  And they're just like, do it.
[2:17:06.620 --> 2:17:07.620]  And they said, no.
[2:17:07.620 --> 2:17:09.620]  So that's why they're going to drones and robots.
[2:17:09.620 --> 2:17:15.620]  They're just going to paint drones up like Iranian aircraft or Russian in the future and fly them into buildings again.
[2:17:15.620 --> 2:17:20.620]  And then where are we then?
[2:17:20.620 --> 2:17:27.620]  Why doesn't the Iranian intelligence agency or the Pakistani, why don't they go after these banking families?
[2:17:27.620 --> 2:17:29.620]  Because they know that the-
[2:17:29.620 --> 2:17:31.620]  Oh, is that what you said?
[2:17:31.620 --> 2:17:32.620]  Oh, you know what?
[2:17:32.620 --> 2:17:33.620]  I'm sorry, your audio is higher now.
[2:17:33.620 --> 2:17:34.620]  Oh, so I'm corrected.
[2:17:34.620 --> 2:17:36.620]  You're saying, why isn't the Iranian?
[2:17:36.620 --> 2:17:38.620]  And I thought you said ours.
[2:17:38.620 --> 2:17:44.620]  The US military to come blow them off the map, and they have very good intelligence services,
[2:17:44.620 --> 2:17:49.620]  but it seems like they're just totally ignoring the Rothschild banking family and all those families
[2:17:49.620 --> 2:17:53.620]  that somebody like Fritz Springmeyer, you know, brings to light.
[2:17:53.620 --> 2:17:55.620]  Yeah, I stand corrected.
[2:17:55.620 --> 2:17:56.620]  Your audio was low.
[2:17:56.620 --> 2:17:57.620]  I miss what you said.
[2:17:57.620 --> 2:17:58.620]  That's a good question.
[2:17:58.620 --> 2:18:03.620]  Why don't the Russians, the Chinese, the Iranians go after the global heads?
[2:18:03.620 --> 2:18:07.620]  The Russians, I'm not saying are perfect, but they do pay people to have kids, the opposite of eugenics.
[2:18:07.620 --> 2:18:11.620]  They have arrested most of the oligarchs and just became oligarchs themselves.
[2:18:11.620 --> 2:18:13.620]  And it turned out most of them did work for the Rothschilds.
[2:18:13.620 --> 2:18:17.620]  That's even been adjudicated in court in England a few weeks ago.
[2:18:17.620 --> 2:18:23.620]  Rothschilds were suing folks over saying that, but it was proven in court that they really are puppet masters.
[2:18:23.620 --> 2:18:29.620]  And I think it's because they're so infiltrated, and they also know if you do try that,
[2:18:29.620 --> 2:18:33.620]  they would just go ahead and nuke Iran and wouldn't care one way or another.
[2:18:33.620 --> 2:18:37.620]  You see, the bankers have the space-based weapons.
[2:18:37.620 --> 2:18:38.620]  They have the nukes.
[2:18:38.620 --> 2:18:39.620]  They have it all.
[2:18:39.620 --> 2:18:42.620]  And so that's why they're so arrogant.
[2:18:42.620 --> 2:18:47.620]  But at a certain point, if I ran Russia and, again, China, who's deeply in Beb of the Alimba,
[2:18:47.620 --> 2:18:58.620]  not the wild card, heavily infiltrated, heavily corrupt, but not from my deep study.
[2:18:58.620 --> 2:19:02.620]  Under the Soviets, it was more connected to the new order than it is now.
[2:19:02.620 --> 2:19:04.620]  Things have really gotten out of control for the globalists.
[2:19:04.620 --> 2:19:07.620]  That's why they're trying to overthrow Russia right now.
[2:19:07.620 --> 2:19:09.620]  And I'm not saying Russia could defeat the new order.
[2:19:09.620 --> 2:19:10.620]  They'd be nice either.
[2:19:10.620 --> 2:19:12.620]  This is the nature of corruption.
[2:19:12.620 --> 2:19:16.620]  But Russia, that's certainly going on, sir.
[2:19:16.620 --> 2:19:18.620]  Anything else?
[2:19:18.620 --> 2:19:20.620]  Love the show.
[2:19:20.620 --> 2:19:22.620]  Well, we love you, my friend.
[2:19:22.620 --> 2:19:25.620]  We love you, the great listers out there that are taking action.
[2:19:25.620 --> 2:19:30.620]  We're going to go to break here in a moment so we get Gerald Salente on with us.
[2:19:30.620 --> 2:19:33.620]  And then we will continue with your phone calls.
[2:19:33.620 --> 2:19:36.620]  And, again, the crew is doing a wonderful job.
[2:19:36.620 --> 2:19:39.620]  It is quite a trick to be able to have him via Skype.
[2:19:39.620 --> 2:19:42.620]  And maybe via Skype because we've got several backups here.
[2:19:42.620 --> 2:19:44.620]  And so we're going to come back after break.
[2:19:44.620 --> 2:19:48.620]  Remember the system's censoring everything we're doing, trying to block us.
[2:19:48.620 --> 2:19:49.620]  They're censoring Ron Paul.
[2:19:49.620 --> 2:19:56.620]  We double your efforts on Ron Paul and getting the word out about infowars.com and this hardcore radio transmission.
[2:19:56.620 --> 2:19:58.620]  There's none other like it on Earth.
[2:19:58.620 --> 2:20:00.620]  And please, make hay while the sun shines.
[2:20:00.620 --> 2:20:02.620]  Helps spread the word today before the next phase comes in.
[2:20:02.620 --> 2:20:07.620]  Folks, Iran and the Mideast nuclear mess is already ballooning our gas prices.
[2:20:07.620 --> 2:20:12.620]  Whether you're struggling with food costs which are being blown up by gas costs now,
[2:20:12.620 --> 2:20:15.620]  or know that when the Mideast showdown explodes,
[2:20:15.620 --> 2:20:20.620]  whatever food supply you have is all you'll get because of huge panic demand.
[2:20:20.620 --> 2:20:22.620]  E-Foods Direct Family Packs are the answer.

[2:21:05.620 --> 2:21:10.620]  That's what it sounds like when a burglar kicks in the door of a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[2:21:10.620 --> 2:21:12.620]  Don't let your home be the next target.
[2:21:12.620 --> 2:21:15.620]  Make it look like someone is home watching television with fake TV.
[2:21:15.620 --> 2:21:19.620]  Fake TV is a small electronic device that makes the same light as a real television,
[2:21:19.620 --> 2:21:22.620]  so from outside it looks like someone is home watching TV.
[2:21:22.620 --> 2:21:27.620]  Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer, but is far more convincing to burglars.
[2:21:27.620 --> 2:21:30.620]  Fake TV deters burglars, costs far less than an alarm,
[2:21:30.620 --> 2:21:33.620]  and is highly recommended by numerous police departments.
[2:21:33.620 --> 2:21:35.620]  Use it anytime you're away from home.
[2:21:35.620 --> 2:21:43.620]  To order your fake TV for only $34.95, go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5 FAKE TV.
[2:21:43.620 --> 2:21:48.620]  Each additional fake TV is only $29.95, so get one for you and one for a loved one
[2:21:48.620 --> 2:21:51.620]  for safety, security, and peace of mind for both of you.
[2:21:51.620 --> 2:22:00.620]  Call 877-5 FAKE TV or go to faketv.com, faketv.com, the burglar deterrent.
[2:22:02.620 --> 2:22:06.620]  If you're having any problems with the IRS or a local revenue agency,
[2:22:06.620 --> 2:22:08.620]  I understand and I can help.
[2:22:08.620 --> 2:22:10.620]  I'm tax attorney Tony Dennison.
[2:22:10.620 --> 2:22:15.620]  When I was a kid, the IRS came after my mother's house because of mistaken information.
[2:22:15.620 --> 2:22:20.620]  Ever since then, I've dedicated my life to defending people in trouble with the IRS.
[2:22:20.620 --> 2:22:23.620]  I'm a real tax attorney, which means I have two law degrees,
[2:22:23.620 --> 2:22:29.620]  a standard law degree known as a JD, and a tax law degree known as a master's of the laws and taxation.

[2:24:20.620 --> 2:24:25.620]  Hey, there's Jimmy Vaughan, another Ron Paul supporter patriot from Austin, Texas.
[2:24:25.620 --> 2:24:27.620]  I saw Jimmy a couple weeks ago.
[2:24:27.620 --> 2:24:29.620]  We had a little snack.
[2:24:29.620 --> 2:24:33.620]  And I was twisting his arm to come in and play some acoustic songs for us.
[2:24:33.620 --> 2:24:36.620]  Maybe he'll do that if you're out there listening to Jimmy.
[2:24:36.620 --> 2:24:40.620]  But going to Gerald Salente for the balance of this hour,
[2:24:40.620 --> 2:24:42.620]  joining us via video Skype as well.
[2:24:42.620 --> 2:24:44.620]  I'm on the road from Baton Rouge.
[2:24:44.620 --> 2:24:47.620]  Gerald, out of the gates, I want to get into the world economy.
[2:24:47.620 --> 2:24:50.620]  I want to get into all the huge developments we're seeing take place.
[2:24:50.620 --> 2:24:54.620]  But what do you make of Ron Paul and the fact that they admit they didn't count all the counties
[2:24:54.620 --> 2:24:58.620]  where he was leading in the polls in Maine, cheated him in Iowa,
[2:24:58.620 --> 2:25:01.620]  Ron Paul saying, yeah, we're contesting this.
[2:25:01.620 --> 2:25:04.620]  But I think Ron Paul should make a bigger deal out of this.
[2:25:04.620 --> 2:25:07.620]  What do you think of what's going on with Ron Paul?
[2:25:07.620 --> 2:25:09.620]  Well, it's what's been going on for a long time.
[2:25:09.620 --> 2:25:11.620]  Remember the...
[2:25:11.620 --> 2:25:18.620]  Go back to the Kennedy election for God's sakes when they rigged it in Illinois.
[2:25:18.620 --> 2:25:20.620]  You know, the place where Obama's from.
[2:25:20.620 --> 2:25:22.620]  Go back to 2000.
[2:25:22.620 --> 2:25:27.620]  You remember the election in the hanging chads in Florida,
[2:25:27.620 --> 2:25:33.620]  the corruption in Ohio, the vote state didn't count in Iowa.
[2:25:33.620 --> 2:25:36.620]  I mean, come on, doesn't anybody get it by now?
[2:25:36.620 --> 2:25:41.620]  And one of the problems I have with Ron Paul is that he doesn't fight back hard enough.
[2:25:41.620 --> 2:25:45.620]  And so it's really just business as usual.
[2:25:45.620 --> 2:25:49.620]  But before I continue, Alex, I want to let you know,
[2:25:49.620 --> 2:25:55.620]  I just came back from Calgary, Canada this morning,
[2:25:55.620 --> 2:25:58.620]  and I did a talk up there.
[2:25:58.620 --> 2:26:03.620]  And I want you to know that you have a load of fans up there.
[2:26:03.620 --> 2:26:06.620]  Everywhere I went, people were coming up to me,
[2:26:06.620 --> 2:26:12.620]  and so many of them said, please say hello to Alex Jones for me.
[2:26:12.620 --> 2:26:15.620]  They love your show.
[2:26:15.620 --> 2:26:20.620]  Well, thank you. It is really an indicator of how many people are awake
[2:26:20.620 --> 2:26:23.620]  just by how anywhere I go, including here in Baton Rouge.
[2:26:23.620 --> 2:26:25.620]  I've had people come up to me last night and today,
[2:26:25.620 --> 2:26:27.620]  and I haven't run into very many people.
[2:26:27.620 --> 2:26:30.620]  This looks like it's a sparsely populated area where I'm at,
[2:26:30.620 --> 2:26:34.620]  but about half the folks I've walked by, it turns out, are listeners or familiar,
[2:26:34.620 --> 2:26:36.620]  and I know you're running into that yourself.
[2:26:36.620 --> 2:26:39.620]  So it shows there's this paradox of awakening happening,
[2:26:39.620 --> 2:26:43.620]  but at the same time, the system's playing like that's not happening,
[2:26:43.620 --> 2:26:45.620]  and it's business as usual.
[2:26:45.620 --> 2:26:47.620]  So where do you see this going, Gerald?
[2:26:47.620 --> 2:26:51.620]  Well, the important thing is, is look who comes up to you,
[2:26:51.620 --> 2:26:54.620]  and a lot of people that come up to me.
[2:26:54.620 --> 2:26:59.620]  You know, they call these young people Generation Zero.
[2:26:59.620 --> 2:27:03.620]  I don't. I call them Generation Courage.
[2:27:03.620 --> 2:27:05.620]  Those are the people.
[2:27:05.620 --> 2:27:09.620]  You know, this is different than the old feudal days, Alex,
[2:27:09.620 --> 2:27:15.620]  when the kings and queens of commerce had a lot of uneducated peasants out there
[2:27:15.620 --> 2:27:18.620]  that they could keep grinding into the dirt.
[2:27:18.620 --> 2:27:21.620]  These are very educated young people.
[2:27:21.620 --> 2:27:25.620]  They're aware. They know what's coming down and what's going on,
[2:27:25.620 --> 2:27:27.620]  and they're the ones that are tuned in,
[2:27:27.620 --> 2:27:30.620]  and they're the ones that are going to make the difference.
[2:27:30.620 --> 2:27:34.620]  Because people my age, I mean, they've given up already.
[2:27:34.620 --> 2:27:36.620]  You know, they've sold out.
[2:27:36.620 --> 2:27:38.620]  They've been bought now, or they're down and out.
[2:27:38.620 --> 2:27:40.620]  So they don't have the fight anymore.
[2:27:40.620 --> 2:27:43.620]  So it's your audience and my audience
[2:27:43.620 --> 2:27:45.620]  that are going to make the difference.
[2:27:45.620 --> 2:27:47.620]  They don't want to take anybody's baloney,
[2:27:47.620 --> 2:27:50.620]  and they're educated enough to know what's going on.
[2:27:50.620 --> 2:27:52.620]  So as you began this and talking about,
[2:27:52.620 --> 2:27:56.620]  oh, they're having trouble, you know, counting ballots.
[2:27:56.620 --> 2:27:57.620]  Yeah, what's new?
[2:27:57.620 --> 2:28:02.620]  You know, the same political corruption gang is in control.
[2:28:02.620 --> 2:28:06.620]  And as I keep saying, as we're moving closer to the selection,
[2:28:06.620 --> 2:28:08.620]  idiots are going to say,
[2:28:08.620 --> 2:28:11.620]  well, you know, I'm going to vote for this one and that one
[2:28:11.620 --> 2:28:14.620]  because they're the lesser of two evil.
[2:28:14.620 --> 2:28:19.620]  What self-respecting adult would vote for a lesser of two evil?
[2:28:19.620 --> 2:28:23.620]  Oh, it's nice getting screwed just a little bit, not a lot.
[2:28:23.620 --> 2:28:28.620]  So no, the change is taking place, and it's going on globally.
[2:28:28.620 --> 2:28:32.620]  So answer your question, what's going on globally?
[2:28:32.620 --> 2:28:37.620]  Go back to the Trends Journal a year ago last spring.
[2:28:37.620 --> 2:28:41.620]  The first great war of the 21st century.
[2:28:41.620 --> 2:28:45.620]  How much do they have to keep beating the people down?
[2:28:45.620 --> 2:28:47.620]  Look what's going on in Greece.
[2:28:47.620 --> 2:28:49.620]  It's a harbinger.
[2:28:49.620 --> 2:28:51.620]  Yeah, I mean, everybody knows the deal.
[2:28:51.620 --> 2:28:53.620]  Let's make this really straight.
[2:28:53.620 --> 2:28:58.620]  Okay, little boys and girls out there in mainstream media land
[2:28:58.620 --> 2:29:01.620]  that just by accident you may be listening today
[2:29:01.620 --> 2:29:05.620]  what they call bailouts, they're not bailouts.
[2:29:05.620 --> 2:29:08.620]  What they are, it's more debt.
[2:29:08.620 --> 2:29:10.620]  You have a first mortgage, you couldn't pay that,
[2:29:10.620 --> 2:29:12.620]  they gave you a second mortgage.
[2:29:12.620 --> 2:29:13.620]  Oh no, we'll change it.
[2:29:13.620 --> 2:29:15.620]  We'll call it a home equity loan.
[2:29:15.620 --> 2:29:17.620]  You couldn't pay the home equity loan,
[2:29:17.620 --> 2:29:20.620]  and if you didn't take your house and you're a country,
[2:29:20.620 --> 2:29:24.620]  they give you a third loan, a fourth loan, a fifth loan.
[2:29:24.620 --> 2:29:27.620]  It's more money to the loan sharks.
[2:29:27.620 --> 2:29:30.620]  All of these austerity measures are one thing
[2:29:30.620 --> 2:29:32.620]  and one thing only.
[2:29:32.620 --> 2:29:35.620]  It's the loan sharks, the money changers
[2:29:35.620 --> 2:29:39.620]  want more money to pay off their debts.
[2:29:39.620 --> 2:29:41.620]  Exactly, stay there, we'll be back
[2:29:41.620 --> 2:29:43.620]  and talk more about that straight ahead
[2:29:43.620 --> 2:29:45.620]  and more with Gerald Salente.
[2:29:45.620 --> 2:30:01.620]  For more information, visit www.alexjonesresearch.com
[2:30:16.620 --> 2:30:19.620]  I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously
[2:30:19.620 --> 2:30:21.620]  and be satisfied.
[2:30:21.620 --> 2:30:24.620]  Now there are hundreds of great products at infowarseteam.com
[2:30:24.620 --> 2:30:26.620]  but I want to point out the three
[2:30:26.620 --> 2:30:32.620]  that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[2:30:32.620 --> 2:30:34.620]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine,
[2:30:34.620 --> 2:30:36.620]  Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[2:30:36.620 --> 2:30:38.620]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine
[2:30:38.620 --> 2:30:40.620]  and other products every day,
[2:30:40.620 --> 2:30:43.620]  I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[2:30:43.620 --> 2:30:45.620]  And that's results.
[2:30:45.620 --> 2:30:47.620]  I want to challenge my listeners
[2:30:47.620 --> 2:30:49.620]  to go to infowarseteam.com
[2:30:49.620 --> 2:30:51.620]  and to order just three of their products
[2:30:51.620 --> 2:30:53.620]  and you will see the changes
[2:30:53.620 --> 2:30:56.620]  in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite

[2:31:43.620 --> 2:31:45.620]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[2:31:45.620 --> 2:31:48.620]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[2:31:48.620 --> 2:31:50.620]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine

[2:33:18.620 --> 2:33:21.620]  All right, I want to bring up
[2:33:21.620 --> 2:33:23.620]  a host of topics
[2:33:23.620 --> 2:33:25.620]  to get Gerald Salente's take on it.
[2:33:25.620 --> 2:33:27.620]  The TSA now operating in major cities
[2:33:27.620 --> 2:33:29.620]  like Dallas.
[2:33:29.620 --> 2:33:31.620]  You name it, doing the grope down there.
[2:33:31.620 --> 2:33:33.620]  And now they're saying, hey,
[2:33:33.620 --> 2:33:35.620]  we're not going to let you hopped out.
[2:33:35.620 --> 2:33:37.620]  They're not announcing it, but they're doing it.
[2:33:37.620 --> 2:33:39.620]  You will go through a scanner and be groped.
[2:33:39.620 --> 2:33:41.620]  And we're going to do it on the side of the highway.
[2:33:41.620 --> 2:33:43.620]  I want to get into that with him.
[2:33:43.620 --> 2:33:45.620]  As we went to break, he was getting more into this awakening.
[2:33:45.620 --> 2:33:48.620]  The term Yankee Doodle
[2:33:48.620 --> 2:33:50.620]  was, if you study history,
[2:33:50.620 --> 2:33:52.620]  was a red coat insult
[2:33:52.620 --> 2:33:54.620]  against the colonist rebels.
[2:33:54.620 --> 2:33:56.620]  A Yankee Dandy
[2:33:56.620 --> 2:33:58.620]  was basically
[2:33:58.620 --> 2:34:00.620]  an effeminate man
[2:34:00.620 --> 2:34:02.620]  in a fancy outfit.
[2:34:02.620 --> 2:34:04.620]  A Yankee Doodle Dandy.
[2:34:04.620 --> 2:34:06.620]  So it was a big insult.
[2:34:06.620 --> 2:34:08.620]  It was saying effeminate men
[2:34:08.620 --> 2:34:10.620]  dressed up like women
[2:34:10.620 --> 2:34:12.620]  basically was a sexual reference.
[2:34:12.620 --> 2:34:15.620]  So the colonist said,
[2:34:15.620 --> 2:34:17.620]  you know what, we'll just take that name from you.
[2:34:17.620 --> 2:34:19.620]  We're Yankee Doodle Dandies.
[2:34:19.620 --> 2:34:21.620]  Watch how dandy we are.
[2:34:21.620 --> 2:34:23.620]  Watch what we do to you.
[2:34:23.620 --> 2:34:25.620]  Watch how we stomp your guts into the ground.
[2:34:25.620 --> 2:34:27.620]  And so they call young people
[2:34:27.620 --> 2:34:29.620]  generation zero.
[2:34:29.620 --> 2:34:31.620]  And I agree, those plugged into the New World Order,
[2:34:31.620 --> 2:34:33.620]  they have become zero.
[2:34:33.620 --> 2:34:35.620]  But zero is where you start over.
[2:34:35.620 --> 2:34:37.620]  Zero is where you begin.
[2:34:37.620 --> 2:34:39.620]  The globalists are minus a trillion.
[2:34:39.620 --> 2:34:41.620]  And sure, the young people are zero.
[2:34:41.620 --> 2:34:43.620]  They're going to go up or down.
[2:34:43.620 --> 2:34:45.620]  They're at that equilibrium point.
[2:34:45.620 --> 2:34:47.620]  That's what I have to say on that point.
[2:34:47.620 --> 2:34:49.620]  So I think we should take their insult name
[2:34:49.620 --> 2:34:51.620]  telling younger generations like Generation X
[2:34:51.620 --> 2:34:53.620]  or Millennialist
[2:34:53.620 --> 2:34:55.620]  or anybody else that they're trash.
[2:34:55.620 --> 2:34:57.620]  And so you know what, you're trash.
[2:34:57.620 --> 2:34:59.620]  And I'm going to make something to myself
[2:34:59.620 --> 2:35:01.620]  no matter what you tell me.
[2:35:01.620 --> 2:35:03.620]  I don't need your Ritalin, your Prozac.
[2:35:03.620 --> 2:35:05.620]  You may have shipped my jobs to China or Mexico,
[2:35:05.620 --> 2:35:07.620]  but I'm going to make the new economy.
[2:35:07.620 --> 2:35:09.620]  Gerald Salenta.
[2:35:09.620 --> 2:35:11.620]  We're starting from the beginning.
[2:35:11.620 --> 2:35:13.620]  And again, it's generation courage.
[2:35:13.620 --> 2:35:15.620]  And every young person out there,
[2:35:15.620 --> 2:35:17.620]  please understand
[2:35:17.620 --> 2:35:19.620]  that you create the future.
[2:35:19.620 --> 2:35:21.620]  And that anyone that tells you
[2:35:21.620 --> 2:35:23.620]  that you don't
[2:35:23.620 --> 2:35:25.620]  is trying to rob you of your
[2:35:25.620 --> 2:35:27.620]  dignity,
[2:35:27.620 --> 2:35:29.620]  your self-respect
[2:35:29.620 --> 2:35:31.620]  and your courage.
[2:35:31.620 --> 2:35:33.620]  And they're trying to enslave
[2:35:33.620 --> 2:35:35.620]  your soul
[2:35:35.620 --> 2:35:37.620]  and deny
[2:35:37.620 --> 2:35:39.620]  from you
[2:35:39.620 --> 2:35:41.620]  the God that lives within you
[2:35:41.620 --> 2:35:43.620]  or the God that you believe in.
[2:35:43.620 --> 2:35:45.620]  You create the future
[2:35:45.620 --> 2:35:47.620]  and if you let them
[2:35:47.620 --> 2:35:49.620]  create the future
[2:35:49.620 --> 2:35:51.620]  for you, you're not going to like it.
[2:35:51.620 --> 2:35:53.620]  Like you take this guy Rick Santorum
[2:35:53.620 --> 2:35:55.620]  talking about God
[2:35:55.620 --> 2:35:57.620]  and about his
[2:35:57.620 --> 2:35:59.620]  I'm sick and tired
[2:35:59.620 --> 2:36:01.620]  of these
[2:36:01.620 --> 2:36:03.620]  phony Christian
[2:36:03.620 --> 2:36:05.620]  BSers.
[2:36:05.620 --> 2:36:07.620]  Let it up to here.
[2:36:07.620 --> 2:36:09.620]  I'm sick of this phony little
[2:36:09.620 --> 2:36:11.620]  alter boy
[2:36:11.620 --> 2:36:13.620]  Rick Santorum
[2:36:13.620 --> 2:36:15.620]  telling me about Satan
[2:36:15.620 --> 2:36:17.620]  and what I have to believe.
[2:36:17.620 --> 2:36:19.620]  Here, Ricky,
[2:36:19.620 --> 2:36:21.620]  check this one out
[2:36:21.620 --> 2:36:23.620]  the next time you use
[2:36:23.620 --> 2:36:25.620]  Jesus Christ's
[2:36:25.620 --> 2:36:27.620]  name in vain.
[2:36:27.620 --> 2:36:29.620]  He wouldn't borrow
[2:36:29.620 --> 2:36:31.620]  on. You got it?
[2:36:31.620 --> 2:36:33.620]  He wouldn't start on a war
[2:36:33.620 --> 2:36:35.620]  with your little chicken
[2:36:35.620 --> 2:36:37.620]  with the size of
[2:36:37.620 --> 2:36:39.620]  the size of a moth
[2:36:39.620 --> 2:36:41.620]  a little smaller.
[2:36:41.620 --> 2:36:43.620]  Jesus Christ wouldn't kill
[2:36:43.620 --> 2:36:45.620]  other people because
[2:36:45.620 --> 2:36:47.620]  you don't like them, Junior.
[2:36:47.620 --> 2:36:49.620]  So what I'm telling the young
[2:36:49.620 --> 2:36:51.620]  people out there is to
[2:36:51.620 --> 2:36:53.620]  listen to what they're hearing
[2:36:53.620 --> 2:36:55.620]  and create the future
[2:36:55.620 --> 2:36:57.620]  that you want.
[2:36:57.620 --> 2:36:59.620]  Well,
[2:36:59.620 --> 2:37:01.620]  very well said, Gerald.
[2:37:01.620 --> 2:37:03.620]  Look, I personally am a Christian.
[2:37:03.620 --> 2:37:05.620]  I have a real relationship with God.
[2:37:05.620 --> 2:37:07.620]  No, no, no, but I'm going to expand
[2:37:07.620 --> 2:37:09.620]  on what you're saying. You look at him.
[2:37:09.620 --> 2:37:11.620]  You can tell he's at a household.
[2:37:11.620 --> 2:37:13.620]  You can tell it's totally fake.
[2:37:13.620 --> 2:37:15.620]  You can see him
[2:37:15.620 --> 2:37:17.620]  vote for the Patriot Act. You can see him
[2:37:17.620 --> 2:37:19.620]  support bailouts.
[2:37:19.620 --> 2:37:21.620]  It's all talk with these
[2:37:21.620 --> 2:37:23.620]  guys. It's all a big
[2:37:23.620 --> 2:37:25.620]  joke. It's like Duke Enrich saying
[2:37:25.620 --> 2:37:27.620]  he's a Christian when he wrote stuff bad
[2:37:27.620 --> 2:37:29.620]  about Christians decades ago.
[2:37:29.620 --> 2:37:31.620]  To them, it's all an act.
[2:37:31.620 --> 2:37:33.620]  To them, it's totally fake.
[2:37:33.620 --> 2:37:35.620]  And, you know, you don't hear him talking
[2:37:35.620 --> 2:37:37.620]  about how the CIA is using al-Qaeda
[2:37:37.620 --> 2:37:39.620]  in the Arab Spring. No, it's
[2:37:39.620 --> 2:37:41.620]  all talk with Santorum.
[2:37:41.620 --> 2:37:43.620]  It's all about selling out our sovereignty
[2:37:43.620 --> 2:37:45.620]  and it's disgusting.
[2:37:45.620 --> 2:37:47.620]  It is disgusting to see them
[2:37:47.620 --> 2:37:49.620]  use religion on people. I agree with you.
[2:37:49.620 --> 2:37:51.620]  Yeah, and then of all of them,
[2:37:51.620 --> 2:37:53.620]  Rick Perry, Herman Cain,
[2:37:53.620 --> 2:37:55.620]  Michelle Bachman, remember
[2:37:55.620 --> 2:37:57.620]  they all come up with that line
[2:37:57.620 --> 2:37:59.620]  God told me to run.
[2:37:59.620 --> 2:38:01.620]  Hey, guess what? God struck
[2:38:01.620 --> 2:38:03.620]  out over three, you know?
[2:38:03.620 --> 2:38:05.620]  I mean, over these people, enough of this
[2:38:05.620 --> 2:38:07.620]  Jesus selling.
[2:38:07.620 --> 2:38:09.620]  It's a lot of crap. But anyway,
[2:38:09.620 --> 2:38:11.620]  moving forward, Alex,
[2:38:11.620 --> 2:38:13.620]  gold prices as we speak
[2:38:13.620 --> 2:38:15.620]  just shot up
[2:38:15.620 --> 2:38:17.620]  $20 an ounce.
[2:38:17.620 --> 2:38:19.620]  Gee, wonder why? Oh, isn't
[2:38:19.620 --> 2:38:21.620]  this brilliant? I got a good one for you.
[2:38:21.620 --> 2:38:23.620]  Let's put sanctions
[2:38:23.620 --> 2:38:25.620]  on Iran.
[2:38:25.620 --> 2:38:27.620]  You are tightening up the oil
[2:38:27.620 --> 2:38:29.620]  spigot and all of a sudden
[2:38:29.620 --> 2:38:31.620]  what's oil selling
[2:38:31.620 --> 2:38:33.620]  for now? Oh,
[2:38:33.620 --> 2:38:35.620]  $122 a barrel,
[2:38:35.620 --> 2:38:37.620]  Brent Crude.
[2:38:37.620 --> 2:38:39.620]  Hey, brilliant man.
[2:38:39.620 --> 2:38:41.620]  Go back ten years ago.
[2:38:41.620 --> 2:38:43.620]  What was it selling for?
[2:38:43.620 --> 2:38:45.620]  Gee, son of a gun. $20 a barrel?
[2:38:45.620 --> 2:38:47.620]  You mean to tell me
[2:38:47.620 --> 2:38:49.620]  that oil's gone up
[2:38:49.620 --> 2:38:51.620]  $100 a barrel?
[2:38:51.620 --> 2:38:53.620]  You mean to tell me
[2:38:53.620 --> 2:38:55.620]  in ten years, gold gone up
[2:38:55.620 --> 2:38:57.620]  from $280 an ounce
[2:38:57.620 --> 2:38:59.620]  to $1,780
[2:38:59.620 --> 2:39:01.620]  an ounce?
[2:39:01.620 --> 2:39:03.620]  That's actually a six-fold increase
[2:39:03.620 --> 2:39:05.620]  in oil. That's a almost
[2:39:05.620 --> 2:39:07.620]  six-fold increase. Gold, what is it
[2:39:07.620 --> 2:39:09.620]  a seven-fold increase? Eight-fold?
[2:39:09.620 --> 2:39:11.620]  So, that's what you have.
[2:39:11.620 --> 2:39:13.620]  Now, the little
[2:39:13.620 --> 2:39:15.620]  CNBC
[2:39:15.620 --> 2:39:17.620]  sellouts, you know those
[2:39:17.620 --> 2:39:19.620]  guys that bow down, suck up
[2:39:19.620 --> 2:39:21.620]  and eat up anything
[2:39:21.620 --> 2:39:23.620]  that they have to to keep
[2:39:23.620 --> 2:39:25.620]  pumping up the markets.
[2:39:25.620 --> 2:39:27.620]  They used to call people like me
[2:39:27.620 --> 2:39:29.620]  gold bugs. Why did
[2:39:29.620 --> 2:39:31.620]  golden oil go up? No, no, no.
[2:39:31.620 --> 2:39:33.620]  It's not demand.
[2:39:33.620 --> 2:39:35.620]  That's only a small part
[2:39:35.620 --> 2:39:37.620]  of it. It's because
[2:39:37.620 --> 2:39:39.620]  they're devaluing the dollar.
[2:39:39.620 --> 2:39:41.620]  They're driving everybody
[2:39:41.620 --> 2:39:43.620]  into
[2:39:43.620 --> 2:39:45.620]  slavery.
[2:39:45.620 --> 2:39:47.620]  That's right because
[2:39:47.620 --> 2:39:49.620]  now interest rates are down near
[2:39:49.620 --> 2:39:51.620]  zero. You're being forced
[2:39:51.620 --> 2:39:53.620]  to put your money into these
[2:39:53.620 --> 2:39:55.620]  baloney equity markets
[2:39:55.620 --> 2:39:57.620]  and all of you older people out there
[2:39:57.620 --> 2:39:59.620]  that are on social security
[2:39:59.620 --> 2:40:01.620]  you're not going to get
[2:40:01.620 --> 2:40:03.620]  cost of living increases.
[2:40:03.620 --> 2:40:05.620]  Why not?
[2:40:05.620 --> 2:40:07.620]  I'll tell you why not
[2:40:07.620 --> 2:40:09.620]  because there's no inflation.
[2:40:09.620 --> 2:40:11.620]  I just made that oil number
[2:40:11.620 --> 2:40:13.620]  up, right?
[2:40:13.620 --> 2:40:15.620]  Because they don't add
[2:40:15.620 --> 2:40:17.620]  food and fuel
[2:40:17.620 --> 2:40:19.620]  to the core
[2:40:19.620 --> 2:40:21.620]  inflation index.
[2:40:21.620 --> 2:40:23.620]  They're devaluing the dollar
[2:40:23.620 --> 2:40:25.620]  and like any good
[2:40:25.620 --> 2:40:27.620]  fascist country
[2:40:27.620 --> 2:40:29.620]  they're cooking the numbers.
[2:40:29.620 --> 2:40:31.620]  Oh and talking about fascism
[2:40:31.620 --> 2:40:33.620]  you heard me say it Alex
[2:40:33.620 --> 2:40:35.620]  from the beginning. I said
[2:40:35.620 --> 2:40:37.620]  anyone that's calling
[2:40:37.620 --> 2:40:39.620]  and this is going on for years
[2:40:39.620 --> 2:40:41.620]  anyone that's calling Obama
[2:40:41.620 --> 2:40:43.620]  a communist, a Marxist, a socialist
[2:40:43.620 --> 2:40:45.620]  you got it wrong. The merger
[2:40:45.620 --> 2:40:47.620]  between corporate powers
[2:40:47.620 --> 2:40:49.620]  by definition is called fascism
[2:40:49.620 --> 2:40:51.620]  and what did Ron Paul
[2:40:51.620 --> 2:40:53.620]  say a couple of days ago?
[2:40:53.620 --> 2:40:55.620]  America's turning fascist.
[2:40:55.620 --> 2:40:57.620]  That's right
[2:40:57.620 --> 2:40:59.620]  they're ready to enslave you
[2:40:59.620 --> 2:41:01.620]  and if you don't fight
[2:41:01.620 --> 2:41:03.620]  back now
[2:41:03.620 --> 2:41:05.620]  Jack you're dead.
[2:41:05.620 --> 2:41:07.620]  Well Ron Paul
[2:41:07.620 --> 2:41:09.620]  has come out and said the CIA's had a coup
[2:41:09.620 --> 2:41:11.620]  in America and brings the drugs in. He has
[2:41:11.620 --> 2:41:13.620]  said that it's turning fascist
[2:41:13.620 --> 2:41:15.620]  and it's accelerating
[2:41:15.620 --> 2:41:17.620]  and it is.
[2:41:17.620 --> 2:41:19.620]  The good news is
[2:41:19.620 --> 2:41:21.620]  there's a silver lining in the bad
[2:41:21.620 --> 2:41:23.620]  at least now we've been validated
[2:41:23.620 --> 2:41:25.620]  we've been made credible
[2:41:25.620 --> 2:41:27.620]  and folks if they do actually attack Iran
[2:41:27.620 --> 2:41:29.620]  on the low side
[2:41:29.620 --> 2:41:31.620]  oil's going to probably go to $200 a barrel
[2:41:31.620 --> 2:41:33.620]  which will kill our economy
[2:41:33.620 --> 2:41:35.620]  for five six months. It might go to 300.
[2:41:35.620 --> 2:41:37.620]  If they actually shut down the Strait of Hormuz
[2:41:37.620 --> 2:41:39.620]  the effects of this
[2:41:39.620 --> 2:41:41.620]  and now as I said they would do Gerald
[2:41:41.620 --> 2:41:43.620]  they're hyping a terror attack
[2:41:43.620 --> 2:41:45.620]  in America and putting armed guards
[2:41:45.620 --> 2:41:47.620]  outside federal buildings including
[2:41:47.620 --> 2:41:49.620]  Social Security offices harassing citizens
[2:41:49.620 --> 2:41:51.620]  and saying Iran's going to attack.
[2:41:51.620 --> 2:41:53.620]  I think a false flag
[2:41:53.620 --> 2:41:55.620]  is really in the cards
[2:41:55.620 --> 2:41:57.620]  ahead of an attack on Iran unless we get
[2:41:57.620 --> 2:41:59.620]  the word out on it. I agree
[2:41:59.620 --> 2:42:01.620]  I've been going to your site
[2:42:01.620 --> 2:42:03.620]  I've been seeing the great work that you've been doing
[2:42:03.620 --> 2:42:05.620]  particularly the one about
[2:42:05.620 --> 2:42:07.620]  oh yeah they're going to bomb the Statue of Liberty
[2:42:07.620 --> 2:42:09.620]  oh yeah right
[2:42:09.620 --> 2:42:11.620]  the Washington Monument you know
[2:42:11.620 --> 2:42:13.620]  and then the White House. I mean come on
[2:42:13.620 --> 2:42:15.620]  and you know how they do it all the time
[2:42:15.620 --> 2:42:17.620]  every time that there's an anniversary
[2:42:17.620 --> 2:42:19.620]  of something all of a sudden
[2:42:19.620 --> 2:42:21.620]  they close down the highways
[2:42:21.620 --> 2:42:23.620]  they have checkpoints everywhere
[2:42:23.620 --> 2:42:25.620]  it's fascism
[2:42:25.620 --> 2:42:27.620]  that's all it is
[2:42:27.620 --> 2:42:29.620]  let's call a spade
[2:42:29.620 --> 2:42:31.620]  a spade
[2:42:31.620 --> 2:42:33.620]  and America has turned fascist
[2:42:33.620 --> 2:42:35.620]  as I predicted
[2:42:35.620 --> 2:42:37.620]  and as I also forecast
[2:42:37.620 --> 2:42:39.620]  in the trends journal years ago
[2:42:39.620 --> 2:42:41.620]  when they first started
[2:42:41.620 --> 2:42:43.620]  these bailouts
[2:42:43.620 --> 2:42:45.620]  it's there for everybody to see
[2:42:45.620 --> 2:42:47.620]  I said when the bailouts
[2:42:47.620 --> 2:42:49.620]  fail the recovery
[2:42:49.620 --> 2:42:51.620]  is no recovery
[2:42:51.620 --> 2:42:53.620]  the next thing they will do
[2:42:53.620 --> 2:42:55.620]  is take you to war
[2:42:55.620 --> 2:42:57.620]  and they're ready to take us
[2:42:57.620 --> 2:42:59.620]  to war against Iran
[2:42:59.620 --> 2:43:01.620]  and if we go to
[2:43:01.620 --> 2:43:03.620]  war against Iran
[2:43:03.620 --> 2:43:05.620]  it's the beginning of World War 3
[2:43:05.620 --> 2:43:07.620]  so get out those
[2:43:07.620 --> 2:43:09.620]  yellow ribbons
[2:43:09.620 --> 2:43:11.620]  put up those flags
[2:43:11.620 --> 2:43:13.620]  you're gonna
[2:43:13.620 --> 2:43:15.620]  they bought into it before
[2:43:15.620 --> 2:43:17.620]  and they'll buy into it again
[2:43:17.620 --> 2:43:19.620]  you know Alex
[2:43:19.620 --> 2:43:21.620]  I heard Michelle Obama out there
[2:43:21.620 --> 2:43:23.620]  last week going to troops
[2:43:23.620 --> 2:43:25.620]  and telling them to eat
[2:43:25.620 --> 2:43:27.620]  their broccoli and eat healthy
[2:43:27.620 --> 2:43:29.620]  oh that's right Michelle
[2:43:29.620 --> 2:43:31.620]  so they could send them over
[2:43:31.620 --> 2:43:33.620]  to another fake war
[2:43:33.620 --> 2:43:35.620]  to get their arms blown off
[2:43:35.620 --> 2:43:37.620]  their brains blown out
[2:43:37.620 --> 2:43:39.620]  so that
[2:43:39.620 --> 2:43:41.620]  fascism could
[2:43:41.620 --> 2:43:43.620]  continue on the course
[2:43:43.620 --> 2:43:45.620]  that we've set
[2:43:45.620 --> 2:43:47.620]  because we are moving in
[2:43:47.620 --> 2:43:49.620]  to the first great war
[2:43:49.620 --> 2:43:51.620]  of the 21st century
[2:43:51.620 --> 2:43:53.620]  and if people don't stand up
[2:43:53.620 --> 2:43:55.620]  and speak out and stop it
[2:43:55.620 --> 2:43:57.620]  it's going to be a terrible future
[2:43:57.620 --> 2:43:59.620]  alright
[2:43:59.620 --> 2:44:01.620]  let me put something out here
[2:44:01.620 --> 2:44:03.620]  exactly it's like we're going to have you
[2:44:03.620 --> 2:44:05.620]  clean
[2:44:05.620 --> 2:44:07.620]  the tank cannons
[2:44:07.620 --> 2:44:09.620]  and the tank guns
[2:44:09.620 --> 2:44:11.620]  that are full of DU
[2:44:11.620 --> 2:44:13.620]  that's a death dose without even a gas mask on
[2:44:13.620 --> 2:44:15.620]  or without even a breathing mask
[2:44:15.620 --> 2:44:17.620]  even though our own manual said it's going to kill you
[2:44:17.620 --> 2:44:19.620]  it'll take 10-15 years but it will
[2:44:19.620 --> 2:44:21.620]  but eat your broccoli
[2:44:21.620 --> 2:44:23.620]  and we're going to steal your death benefits
[2:44:23.620 --> 2:44:25.620]  which they signed secret deals 12 years ago to do
[2:44:25.620 --> 2:44:27.620]  but because we say we love you
[2:44:27.620 --> 2:44:29.620]  and oh thank you for your service
[2:44:29.620 --> 2:44:31.620]  it's all this fakeness
[2:44:31.620 --> 2:44:33.620]  as the criminals just like
[2:44:33.620 --> 2:44:35.620]  they wrap themselves in Jesus
[2:44:35.620 --> 2:44:37.620]  they wrap themselves in the troops
[2:44:37.620 --> 2:44:39.620]  but you mentioned an article
[2:44:39.620 --> 2:44:41.620]  two days ago
[2:44:41.620 --> 2:44:43.620]  by Curt Nemo
[2:44:45.620 --> 2:44:47.620]  I think the guys have their
[2:44:47.620 --> 2:44:49.620]  microphone open there at the network guys
[2:44:49.620 --> 2:44:51.620]  continuing sorry
[2:44:51.620 --> 2:44:53.620]  former CIA boss
[2:44:53.620 --> 2:44:55.620]  says Iran will attack Statue
[2:44:55.620 --> 2:44:57.620]  of Liberty
[2:44:57.620 --> 2:44:59.620]  and I didn't even cover this
[2:44:59.620 --> 2:45:01.620]  two days ago
[2:45:01.620 --> 2:45:03.620]  when Curt
[2:45:03.620 --> 2:45:05.620]  first wrote the article
[2:45:05.620 --> 2:45:07.620]  and it was linked all over the news
[2:45:07.620 --> 2:45:09.620]  them saying this like it was serious
[2:45:09.620 --> 2:45:11.620]  I've seen James Woolsey speak at UT in person
[2:45:11.620 --> 2:45:13.620]  I've watched him on the news
[2:45:13.620 --> 2:45:15.620]  he has absolutely no credibility
[2:45:15.620 --> 2:45:17.620]  and comes off like a scam
[2:45:17.620 --> 2:45:19.620]  artist con artist
[2:45:19.620 --> 2:45:21.620]  if I was going to hire somebody in a movie
[2:45:21.620 --> 2:45:23.620]  to play the part of a disingenuous
[2:45:23.620 --> 2:45:25.620]  scam
[2:45:25.620 --> 2:45:27.620]  artist or something
[2:45:27.620 --> 2:45:29.620]  I would have somebody like
[2:45:29.620 --> 2:45:31.620]  James Woolsey as the character
[2:45:31.620 --> 2:45:33.620]  and here he is
[2:45:33.620 --> 2:45:35.620]  they want to blow up the Statue of Liberty
[2:45:35.620 --> 2:45:37.620]  this archetypal image of what the bad guys
[2:45:37.620 --> 2:45:39.620]  are going to do
[2:45:39.620 --> 2:45:41.620]  Gerald give us your take on that
[2:45:41.620 --> 2:45:43.620]  because I mean you mentioned it
[2:45:43.620 --> 2:45:45.620]  it is so ridiculous
[2:45:45.620 --> 2:45:47.620]  it's a false flag
[2:45:47.620 --> 2:45:49.620]  hey Alex you know that's what I'm going to say
[2:45:49.620 --> 2:45:51.620]  and that's what I thought might have been going on with the back talking chatter
[2:45:51.620 --> 2:45:53.620]  do we lose Gerald Salente
[2:45:53.620 --> 2:45:55.620]  can you hear me
[2:45:55.620 --> 2:45:57.620]  hello
[2:46:01.620 --> 2:46:03.620]  hello Alex
[2:46:03.620 --> 2:46:05.620]  you know when you mentioned
[2:46:05.620 --> 2:46:07.620]  Woolsey whatever his name is
[2:46:07.620 --> 2:46:09.620]  I mean they're all scam artists
[2:46:09.620 --> 2:46:11.620]  look at the guy that's the head of the CIA now
[2:46:11.620 --> 2:46:13.620]  Petraeus the New York Times
[2:46:13.620 --> 2:46:15.620]  he was the former general
[2:46:15.620 --> 2:46:17.620]  that was going to win Afghanistan
[2:46:17.620 --> 2:46:19.620]  they used to say that
[2:46:19.620 --> 2:46:21.620]  we had a Boy Scout charm
[2:46:21.620 --> 2:46:23.620]  why isn't that wonderful
[2:46:23.620 --> 2:46:25.620]  a Boy Scout charm
[2:46:25.620 --> 2:46:27.620]  just what you need
[2:46:27.620 --> 2:46:29.620]  it's all a con game
[2:46:29.620 --> 2:46:31.620]  look at the meetings that they have over in Brussels
[2:46:31.620 --> 2:46:33.620]  as they're raging
[2:46:33.620 --> 2:46:35.620]  Greece into poverty
[2:46:35.620 --> 2:46:37.620]  you see Christine Lagarde
[2:46:37.620 --> 2:46:39.620]  the head of the IMF
[2:46:39.620 --> 2:46:41.620]  all of these other flunkies
[2:46:41.620 --> 2:46:43.620]  they have red carpets rolled out for them
[2:46:43.620 --> 2:46:45.620]  no the whole thing is a charade
[2:46:45.620 --> 2:46:47.620]  and that's what people need to know
[2:46:47.620 --> 2:46:49.620]  and you mentioned
[2:46:49.620 --> 2:46:51.620]  when you hear Santorum
[2:46:51.620 --> 2:46:53.620]  this other guy over there
[2:46:53.620 --> 2:46:55.620]  Christie over in New Jersey
[2:46:55.620 --> 2:46:57.620]  all these people talking about
[2:46:57.620 --> 2:46:59.620]  Jesus Christ
[2:46:59.620 --> 2:47:01.620]  Perry Bachman all of them
[2:47:01.620 --> 2:47:03.620]  Gingrich you know what they are
[2:47:03.620 --> 2:47:05.620]  did Jesus freaks
[2:47:05.620 --> 2:47:07.620]  because Jesus would freak out
[2:47:07.620 --> 2:47:09.620]  if he saw what they were doing
[2:47:09.620 --> 2:47:11.620]  in the name of his
[2:47:11.620 --> 2:47:13.620]  good name
[2:47:13.620 --> 2:47:15.620]  and how they're degrading it
[2:47:15.620 --> 2:47:17.620]  so I want to make this clear Alex
[2:47:17.620 --> 2:47:19.620]  you're looking at gold prices going up
[2:47:19.620 --> 2:47:21.620]  you're looking at oil prices
[2:47:21.620 --> 2:47:23.620]  going up and if people
[2:47:23.620 --> 2:47:25.620]  aren't prepared for what's going to
[2:47:25.620 --> 2:47:27.620]  happen next it's their fault
[2:47:27.620 --> 2:47:29.620]  and I'm making it very clear
[2:47:29.620 --> 2:47:31.620]  I do not give financial advice
[2:47:31.620 --> 2:47:33.620]  but if you have your money in the bank
[2:47:33.620 --> 2:47:35.620]  if you think Charlie Schwab
[2:47:35.620 --> 2:47:37.620]  is taking care of you
[2:47:37.620 --> 2:47:39.620]  you deserve what you get
[2:47:39.620 --> 2:47:41.620]  if your dough isn't in your pocket
[2:47:41.620 --> 2:47:43.620]  or for me
[2:47:43.620 --> 2:47:47.620]  I'm making precious metals
[2:47:47.620 --> 2:47:49.620]  Gerald
[2:47:49.620 --> 2:47:51.620]  you're absolutely right
[2:47:51.620 --> 2:47:53.620]  continue breaking down
[2:47:53.620 --> 2:47:55.620]  where you see this going
[2:47:55.620 --> 2:47:57.620]  again seeing that Gerald
[2:47:57.620 --> 2:47:59.620]  you've been accurate predicting
[2:47:59.620 --> 2:48:01.620]  what they're doing
[2:48:01.620 --> 2:48:03.620]  and they come up with these cartoonish type deals
[2:48:03.620 --> 2:48:05.620]  I remember Fox News
[2:48:05.620 --> 2:48:07.620]  six years ago
[2:48:07.620 --> 2:48:09.620]  showed images from
[2:48:09.620 --> 2:48:11.620]  that
[2:48:11.620 --> 2:48:13.620]  was
[2:48:13.620 --> 2:48:15.620]  Independence Day
[2:48:15.620 --> 2:48:17.620]  where the aliens are blowing up all the monuments
[2:48:17.620 --> 2:48:19.620]  and they actually showed
[2:48:19.620 --> 2:48:21.620]  video from the film
[2:48:21.620 --> 2:48:23.620]  with the alien craft
[2:48:23.620 --> 2:48:25.620]  blowing up the Liberty Tower
[2:48:25.620 --> 2:48:27.620]  but the tower wasn't even called Liberty
[2:48:27.620 --> 2:48:29.620]  so they called it Liberty Tower
[2:48:29.620 --> 2:48:31.620]  even though the building wasn't called that
[2:48:31.620 --> 2:48:33.620]  because it sounded better
[2:48:33.620 --> 2:48:35.620]  and then showed the building blowing up and said
[2:48:35.620 --> 2:48:37.620]  Al Qaeda wants to blow up Liberty Tower
[2:48:37.620 --> 2:48:39.620]  they want to blow up Liberty
[2:48:39.620 --> 2:48:41.620]  and then they went off more
[2:48:41.620 --> 2:48:43.620]  Hollywood
[2:48:43.620 --> 2:48:45.620]  popcorn deal Al Qaeda
[2:48:45.620 --> 2:48:47.620]  who openly works with these same criminal bankers
[2:48:47.620 --> 2:48:49.620]  and the CIA
[2:48:49.620 --> 2:48:51.620]  Massade MI6
[2:48:51.620 --> 2:48:53.620]  Al Qaeda is going to blow up
[2:48:53.620 --> 2:48:55.620]  the Statue of Liberty
[2:48:55.620 --> 2:48:57.620]  with just no evidence
[2:48:57.620 --> 2:48:59.620]  and it's a guy that looks so shifty
[2:48:59.620 --> 2:49:01.620]  he makes Eddie Haskell
[2:49:01.620 --> 2:49:03.620]  and Hitler look like good guys
[2:49:03.620 --> 2:49:05.620]  well again you mentioned the word Hollywood
[2:49:05.620 --> 2:49:07.620]  and that's all politics is
[2:49:07.620 --> 2:49:14.500]  show business for ugly people. How could Americans have any respect for themselves when they
[2:49:14.500 --> 2:49:20.820]  look at the cast of clowns in the presidential reality show that are going to tell them how
[2:49:20.820 --> 2:49:26.580]  to run their lives? And by the way, the other term I've had it with are these people calling
[2:49:26.580 --> 2:49:33.940]  themselves law makers. Hey, listen, Junior, I don't need anybody to make any more laws
[2:49:33.940 --> 2:49:42.420]  for me. So when you look at what's going on, it is. It's Hollywood. It's one cheap show.
[2:49:42.420 --> 2:49:48.020]  And we've proven, Alex, we sent out a trend alert a couple of months about a month ago.
[2:49:48.660 --> 2:49:57.220]  We did a major story. Here it is in the Trends Journal. The thorium alternative. You know how
[2:49:57.220 --> 2:50:03.620]  they're screaming about Iran is going to have a nuclear facility, and from that they could make
[2:50:03.620 --> 2:50:08.900]  with that depleted with the uranium, they could turn it into weapons. Well, here's the story.
[2:50:09.700 --> 2:50:16.580]  When they began nuclear power back in the late fifties and sixties, they had two alternatives
[2:50:16.580 --> 2:50:26.020]  to go to uranium or thorium. With uranium, the waste byproduct, the feedstock could be used to
[2:50:26.020 --> 2:50:32.260]  make nuclear weapons. Now, those old enough of us old enough to remember that was during the
[2:50:32.260 --> 2:50:39.300]  height of the Cold War, when the imbeciles had you hiding on the desks as a little kid or putting
[2:50:39.300 --> 2:50:44.740]  it. Stay there, Gerald. Sorry to interrupt. Come back and explain that they chose uranium because
[2:50:44.740 --> 2:50:49.060]  that was going to be the byproduct of the weapons industry instead of the thorium, which they can't
[2:50:49.060 --> 2:50:54.580]  make nuclear weapons out of and is a lot safer. On the other side with Gerald Solente, and I do
[2:50:54.580 --> 2:51:02.500]  intend to try to jam in a few phone calls as well. We'll be right back as websitestrendsresearch.com.

[2:54:13.140 --> 2:54:18.900]  Gerald Salente joins us via video connection and Skype audio for radio listeners from Channel
[2:54:18.900 --> 2:54:24.500]  166 XM to over 100 AM and FM affiliates. And I do want to try to get to some of these calls,
[2:54:24.500 --> 2:54:29.460]  but I know we can't do too much overdrive. Gerald was very kind to come on despite the fact
[2:54:29.460 --> 2:54:34.100]  he just got off an airplane this morning. Gerald, you were explaining the difference between
[2:54:34.980 --> 2:54:39.140]  the types of reactors they could have built versus the uranium based systems.
[2:54:39.860 --> 2:54:45.620]  That's right. So that really, by going with thorium, you can't use it to make the waste
[2:54:45.620 --> 2:54:51.060]  product. You can't use to make a nuclear weapon. So of course, back in the 60s when the whole
[2:54:51.060 --> 2:54:56.980]  world was, you know, the Cold War was going on, they wanted to make nuclear weapons.
[2:54:56.980 --> 2:55:06.340]  Well, now in China, in India, in Brazil, in the Czech Republic, they're all developing nuclear
[2:55:06.340 --> 2:55:16.420]  power plants with the eye toward thorium. So we can all chill out now if Iran simply goes with
[2:55:16.420 --> 2:55:25.540]  thorium rather than nuclear. Is it ready to go? No, but it's almost ready to go. So if the United
[2:55:25.540 --> 2:55:34.180]  States, for example, that just spent a trillion dollars, a trillion dollars fighting a immoral war,
[2:55:34.180 --> 2:55:41.140]  killing a million people, killing 5,000 of our people and wounding mentally and physically
[2:55:41.140 --> 2:55:48.740]  another couple of hundred thousand and destroying an entire country would help Iran go thorium
[2:55:48.740 --> 2:55:57.620]  as we should also be doing with our nuclear power plants, the psychopaths, the Netanyahu's,
[2:55:57.620 --> 2:56:10.980]  the Obamas, the Clintons, the Santorums, the Rammies, all of these psychopaths that want to go to war
[2:56:11.700 --> 2:56:21.300]  won't have an excuse, not that excuse, because Iran would not be able to use the waste materials
[2:56:21.300 --> 2:56:30.580]  from thorium to create a nuclear bomb. And I want one message here, again, why thorium is so much
[2:56:30.580 --> 2:56:37.700]  better. And again, this is from the Trends Journal. Thorium is four times more plentiful worldwide
[2:56:37.700 --> 2:56:47.540]  than uranium. It produces more than 100 to 300 times more energy that can be coaxed from an equal
[2:56:47.540 --> 2:56:57.940]  volume of uranium. It yields less than 1% of the toxic waste in energy generation reaction,
[2:56:57.940 --> 2:57:09.300]  as much as 99% of the thorium can be consumed compared to typically 2% or less of uranium
[2:57:09.300 --> 2:57:15.220]  that goes into generating plants. They went with that to tie us to the weapons system,
[2:57:15.220 --> 2:57:20.740]  and it just shows how this managed fascist economy is killing us, and they don't want to be friends
[2:57:20.740 --> 2:57:26.180]  with everybody. They want to use us to set up an abusive global, corporatist world government
[2:57:26.180 --> 2:57:31.140]  that's destroying our own internal country and doing it with our money. It's incredible. How do
[2:57:31.140 --> 2:57:38.500]  we get rid of these crooks, Gerald? Again, the only way I see is through direct democracy. We
[2:57:38.500 --> 2:57:46.260]  cannot have a gang in the United States of 535 telling us what to do. They're ruining our lives.
[2:57:46.260 --> 2:57:53.540]  Again, turn on the television tonight. Watch the great debate, and you see Santorum.
[2:57:55.780 --> 2:58:00.980]  How come Gingrich doesn't bring Callister out there when he's doing his debate? I mean,
[2:58:00.980 --> 2:58:06.980]  who ever saw a cheap act like that? You know, I just did a talk in Calgary. If I was married,
[2:58:06.980 --> 2:58:14.020]  the last thing I'd want was my wife standing next to me as I'm giving a speech with this plastic
[2:58:14.020 --> 2:58:21.620]  blonde helmet on and looking up at me adorably. How can anybody believe this crap? Well, here's
[2:58:21.620 --> 2:58:27.380]  the good news. That woman looks even more plastic and snake-like than him. She's another social
[2:58:27.380 --> 2:58:34.100]  climber, kind of like Limbaugh's wife, so I think they're really, really, really good for each other.
[2:58:34.100 --> 2:58:38.340]  Gerald, I know you gotta go, but do a few more minutes with us. I want to just hear about a
[2:58:38.340 --> 2:59:04.740]  few of the other trends you've got in jamming. Two quick questions. Back in 60 seconds.
