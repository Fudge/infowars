[00:00.000 --> 00:07.440]  government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the
[00:07.440 --> 00:34.440]  GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:34.440 --> 00:40.680]  as of showtime today central standard time we're having a lot of server
[00:40.680 --> 00:46.080]  problems with info wars.com it's got multiple backup servers and there's
[00:46.080 --> 00:50.480]  some type of problem we unlike others every time we have our own technical
[00:50.480 --> 00:55.920]  problems do not claim it is a hack attack a lot of times it is simply a
[00:55.920 --> 01:01.760]  server going out but we have this happens a couple times a year so info
[01:01.760 --> 01:09.280]  wars.com right now is redirecting you can go there and link through to
[01:09.280 --> 01:16.560]  prisonplanet.com and we've invested a lot but as the site gets bigger and
[01:16.560 --> 01:23.880]  bigger and bigger and bigger it it gets harder and harder to deal with as we
[01:23.880 --> 01:28.560]  have hundreds of thousands of people on it at any one time and as we you know
[01:28.560 --> 01:35.120]  have a database type system that I guess it's WordPress we're about to
[01:35.120 --> 01:38.360]  redesign prisonplanet but we're not even sure we want to go with WordPress
[01:38.360 --> 01:42.840]  because we think it might have glitches for heavily traffic sites that cause
[01:42.840 --> 01:46.240]  this we're trying to analyze it if anybody's got any pointers you're
[01:46.240 --> 01:50.000]  certainly welcome to email us and give us your tips that's gonna be the good
[01:50.000 --> 01:55.280]  part about in the next few months moving into a bigger office is because we are
[01:55.280 --> 02:00.600]  going to be able to have more IT people and right now we don't even have room
[02:00.600 --> 02:06.680]  for folks here in this office and it won't just be one IT person who haven't
[02:06.680 --> 02:12.040]  has to work around the clock try to keep the sites up and deal with everything
[02:12.040 --> 02:17.840]  and that will be possible to get more video editors and then get another
[02:17.840 --> 02:24.040]  extra backup IT person and we're gonna go ahead and start the pilot a television
[02:24.040 --> 02:31.000]  show designed for dish network direct TV slash some of the other systems because
[02:31.000 --> 02:37.320]  two hundred and fifty thousand dollars came in about two hundred and fifteen
[02:37.320 --> 02:42.280]  thousand came in by the end of the money bomb Saturday night May 31st 2008 and
[02:42.280 --> 02:47.880]  then over the rest of the following day and today looks like as much as thirty
[02:47.880 --> 02:53.440]  thousand dollars more came in and of course then we have people pledging that
[02:53.440 --> 02:57.920]  there are checks on the way as well so by the end of the week we'll have that
[02:57.920 --> 03:04.120]  grand total for you for now you can go to info wars at money bomb dot com there's
[03:04.120 --> 03:11.080]  a link to one of our caching servers that actually has the donation buttons
[03:11.080 --> 03:20.480]  on it if you would like to continue to try to give a donation and you have by
[03:20.480 --> 03:26.760]  commitment that one hundred percent of your donation will be spent on fighting
[03:26.760 --> 03:32.440]  the new world order not so much as a thin red scent or as much as the money
[03:32.440 --> 03:37.880]  for a ham sandwich personally will I take out of it it will all go into
[03:37.880 --> 03:42.080]  fighting the new world order don't think all of you the average a donation was
[03:42.080 --> 03:46.600]  right around twenty dollars and so a lot of people donated I don't know how many
[03:46.600 --> 03:50.600]  I think they said like eighteen dollars was the average actually eighteen dollars
[03:50.600 --> 03:55.840]  and change you got two hundred and fifty thousand dollars being given in average
[03:55.840 --> 04:02.600]  of eighteen dollar increments that is just absolutely amazing to have thousands
[04:02.600 --> 04:08.320]  of people giving to make this happen so again I salute you I thank you as we're

[06:09.160 --> 06:12.880]  intend not to be standing in the bread line with the ignorant and the foolish
[06:12.880 --> 06:16.720]  who pretend the facts of food disappearance are untrue if the
[06:16.720 --> 06:21.160]  experience of the Katrina disaster is evidence that bread line may have no
[06:21.160 --> 06:25.920]  bread just like the good intentions on the road to that unheavenly place the

[06:54.160 --> 06:57.920]  hi this is Alex Jones and I want to talk to you about the high price of
[06:57.920 --> 07:02.080]  gasoline it's no secret that gasoline quality is poor even though we're paying
[07:02.080 --> 07:06.000]  record prices at the pump I have run across a company called SFR who has
[07:06.000 --> 07:10.160]  developed two products that improve gas mileage instead of paying a mechanic as
[07:10.160 --> 07:14.320]  much as $300 to clean your injection system protect a complete fuel system
[07:14.320 --> 07:19.440]  treatment cleans to 95% of new engine condition improving mileage and only one
[07:19.440 --> 07:23.480]  tank full protect an engine treatment not only reduces friction but it extends
[07:23.480 --> 07:27.360]  the life of your engine let's face it with the high price of gasoline it's
[07:27.360 --> 07:31.020]  time to take action purchase a protective fuel system treatment for only
[07:31.020 --> 07:36.800]  $9.95 and receive a free engine treatment which is a $12.95 value free call
[07:36.800 --> 07:43.120]  triple-8 use SFR-1 that number again is triple-8 use SFR-1 or check them out

[07:54.720 --> 07:59.600]  central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war
[07:59.600 --> 08:06.040]  continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[08:18.960 --> 08:23.760]  welcome ladies and gentlemen big show lined up for you on to this June 2nd
[08:23.760 --> 08:29.000]  2008 edition of the info war dr. Steven Jones hadn't been homeless for about a
[08:29.000 --> 08:34.920]  year the physicist who was run out of Brigham young for going to the physics
[08:34.920 --> 08:40.560]  of the collapse of the towers they just basically paid him off to leave under
[08:40.560 --> 08:46.320]  threat of going after him and he is now a travel the world travel the country
[08:46.320 --> 08:51.480]  exposing the fact that the towers were destroyed and controlled emulation he
[08:51.480 --> 08:56.400]  and others have had peer-reviewed scientific studies published in some of
[08:56.400 --> 09:01.800]  the most prestigious journals in physics and engineering in the world all
[09:01.800 --> 09:05.080]  the little debunkers kept trying to claim that we could never do that well
[09:05.080 --> 09:10.920]  it's happened and at the same time NIST was supposed to release four years ago
[09:10.920 --> 09:17.000]  why the towers fell then they said it would be in 2005 then they said they do
[09:17.000 --> 09:21.180]  it in 2006 then they said they do it in late 2006 and they said early
[09:21.180 --> 09:27.840]  2007 then they said mid 2007 and they said late 2007 and they said early 2008
[09:27.840 --> 09:33.240]  and they just will not release now they put out five different reasons that
[09:33.240 --> 09:40.600]  building seven fell and had to retract each one it was not the oil tank the
[09:40.600 --> 09:44.960]  kerosene tank in the building for the backup generator for the CIA and Command
[09:44.960 --> 09:48.800]  Center that was in there oh yeah that's it was in there and the Army intelligence
[09:48.800 --> 09:53.240]  and the FBI and the rest of them spookville it was not one of the towers
[09:53.240 --> 09:56.800]  falling into it which it didn't complete lie we have the photos and video of the
[09:56.800 --> 10:00.480]  front of the building and they admit that now it wasn't that it was shoddily
[10:00.480 --> 10:06.280]  built not to specs they had to retract that it wasn't that fire weakened it and
[10:06.280 --> 10:12.880]  did it it wasn't any of that so remember when the disinfo people are all over the
[10:12.880 --> 10:17.560]  web and TV and in print saying why the government says it collapsed from weakened
[10:17.560 --> 10:22.280]  steel just remember NIST doesn't even say that they can't even get the
[10:22.280 --> 10:27.720]  government scientists to lie just like they couldn't get the CIA to lie about
[10:27.720 --> 10:33.800]  Saddam's WMD's so they created a special office of plans with a bunch of foreign
[10:33.800 --> 10:37.680]  agents that work for foreign governments not even Americans most of them and they
[10:37.680 --> 10:42.840]  just cooked up lies and they're doing the same thing what I ran right now it's
[10:42.840 --> 10:48.000]  what they do they're a pack of liars so dr. Stephen Jones joining us in about
[10:48.000 --> 10:54.920]  50 minutes we've got dr. Mayor Hillman who came up with the idea 18 years ago
[10:54.920 --> 11:00.320]  he popularized it I saw it before that he's pushing for a global carbon tax
[11:00.320 --> 11:04.920]  you'll have your global carbon ID card to track everything you do you get your
[11:04.920 --> 11:11.120]  certain amount of creds after that you pay taxes can't have children unless
[11:11.120 --> 11:16.680]  you're below your cred level well you can't raise a child living in a thatch
[11:16.680 --> 11:21.320]  hut with no running water so it's over you're not authorized so he'll be joining
[11:21.320 --> 11:31.640]  us and then major general stubble bind he ran Fort Bragg ran special operations
[11:31.640 --> 11:37.040]  for many years and he will come on there's a big movie coming out being
[11:37.040 --> 11:41.000]  produced right now with George Clooney George Clooney bought the book and stars
[11:41.000 --> 11:46.280]  in it men who stare at goats the fellow that wrote the hit piece and later
[11:46.280 --> 11:52.840]  apologized about it John Ronson wrote them that by the way got bought by Jack
[11:52.840 --> 11:57.320]  Black who is now about to start production if it's not already in
[11:57.320 --> 12:04.720]  production I'm told of the book them and I'm told I'm a central character being
[12:04.720 --> 12:09.920]  made fun of in it adventures with extremists that was New York Times
[12:09.920 --> 12:15.240]  bestseller about my infiltration of Bohemian Grove and other escapades and
[12:15.240 --> 12:19.300]  other quote extremist though I'm the one of the central extremist along with
[12:19.300 --> 12:28.840]  David Ike and then Ian Paisley of all people is just a Protestant but men who
[12:28.840 --> 12:34.320]  stare at goats is about stubble buying because the military believes that with
[12:34.320 --> 12:40.600]  their minds they did indeed kill animals with their minds and whether you
[12:40.600 --> 12:47.800]  believe in this or not the government does and the special forces do and so
[12:47.800 --> 12:58.880]  we'll have stubble buying on we've had him on before very very bizarre but
[12:58.880 --> 13:02.120]  stubble buying believes in remote viewing stubble buying believes I guess you
[13:02.120 --> 13:07.600]  call it astral projection I don't get into these type of things normally this
[13:07.600 --> 13:11.680]  is not kind of our genre it's more of a George Norrie type thing but when it is
[13:11.680 --> 13:16.720]  the former head of special forces when it is a major general when it is someone
[13:16.720 --> 13:20.120]  who believes in this stuff and they're making a major movie about it I thought
[13:20.120 --> 13:26.480]  hey we ought to have him on about this so we we will have the man who the
[13:26.480 --> 13:30.840]  upcoming George Clooney movies about men who stare at goats we're not sure what
[13:30.840 --> 13:38.040]  they're gonna call the movie but maybe we can have some special forces for the
[13:38.040 --> 13:44.320]  decade they did this plus call in did you kill the goat with your mind we'll
[13:44.320 --> 13:51.160]  find out coming up we know the Soviets believe in this stuff too why but that
[13:51.160 --> 13:56.600]  throws the atheists for a loop I mean what do they think this is see I would
[13:56.600 --> 13:59.640]  totally discount stubble buying but I've told you I've had quite a few dreams
[13:59.640 --> 14:07.440]  that come true and in other experiences I won't get into on air but I mean this
[14:07.440 --> 14:13.320]  is stuff where I tell people about it and I know a lot of you've had that happen
[14:13.320 --> 14:18.120]  I mean there's the classic case of I kept saying we got to go see my
[14:18.120 --> 14:20.040]  grandmother we got to go see my grandmother hadn't seen her in about
[14:20.040 --> 14:24.440]  four or five months she'd been real sick but she was getting up and around and
[14:24.440 --> 14:28.480]  she got a stroke years before and had trouble eating but she was doing fine
[14:28.480 --> 14:31.280]  and I told my dad I said we got to go see her this week I got a really bad
[14:31.280 --> 14:34.800]  feeling about her he goes now she's doing real real well but okay we'll go
[14:34.800 --> 14:39.880]  this Saturday and then he he showed up at my house and I've been up on some
[14:39.880 --> 14:45.000]  radio showed about 4 a.m. this is about five years ago or four years ago that
[14:45.000 --> 14:50.280]  she died that's four years ago my son was about a year old or less than a year
[14:50.280 --> 14:56.680]  but he shows up about 730 bangs on the door honestly he's drinking coffee
[14:56.680 --> 15:00.040]  downstairs I've been up all night he's standing over me in the bed he goes I'm
[15:00.040 --> 15:05.400]  just going I'll see you there he gets halfway to East Texas halfway to
[15:05.400 --> 15:11.400]  Buffalo slash Fairfields where my dad's folks are from and he calls me up on the
[15:11.400 --> 15:17.920]  phone and he says yeah my mother just died your grandmother just died he was
[15:17.920 --> 15:24.560]  almost there so and they talk about this in the diamond mines and the emerald
[15:24.560 --> 15:29.600]  mines and the now what's the other big thing they dig out there in Australia
[15:29.600 --> 15:33.920]  the opal mines they'll have those aborigines down in the mines and then
[15:33.920 --> 15:37.840]  they're never wrong this has even been the news over there a mainstream news
[15:37.840 --> 15:40.480]  they'll come out of the mine they'll say put me on a helicopter put me on a
[15:40.480 --> 15:45.440]  plane my mother's just died or my father just died they said their their
[15:45.440 --> 15:48.400]  connection to their mothers is even stronger it's just they grew inside of
[15:48.400 --> 15:54.400]  them and they'll they'll get them and they'll they'll call this even happened
[15:54.400 --> 15:57.600]  in 30s 40s 50s where they a lot of times even had telephones up to the rural areas
[15:57.600 --> 16:02.920]  still some areas don't and when they get their mom was dead
[16:03.680 --> 16:09.640]  I guess when you grow inside another creature and you're actually timed your
[16:09.640 --> 16:14.160]  whole metabolic rate is timed to their heartbeat I mean there's something going
[16:14.160 --> 16:18.360]  on it's like wavelengths you can't see radio waves you can't see television
[16:18.360 --> 16:24.680]  waves you can't see the cell phone waves you can't see most of the spectrum of
[16:24.680 --> 16:30.960]  light you could see the bright Sun or you can see rays of Sun in dust there's
[16:30.960 --> 16:35.640]  dust or pollen in the air you can see the rays in your house when the sunlight
[16:35.640 --> 16:42.800]  shooting through that's only one tiny spectrum of everything that's being
[16:42.800 --> 16:47.400]  projected so I don't know the problem is looking into this stuff there's a lot of
[16:47.400 --> 16:52.120]  quacks, kooks, nuts, con artists that gravitate towards it so you can't believe
[16:52.120 --> 16:59.160]  99% of what you hear out there 99% of it is bull now that's the thing that's what
[16:59.160 --> 17:02.680]  so many police agencies believe in psychics and go out and hire them and end
[17:02.680 --> 17:07.000]  up having good results if it's with the few that have actually proven themselves
[17:07.000 --> 17:12.520]  because the police know there's something to it I don't know what it is
[17:12.520 --> 17:16.440]  I'm already digressing out a bunch of news I want to cover a bunch of audio
[17:16.440 --> 17:21.880]  clips I want to play let's go ahead and play this first now now now as bad as
[17:21.880 --> 17:26.480]  this report sounds it's a complete and total whitewash so we'll play the clip
[17:26.480 --> 17:29.880]  come back play the rest of the clip and then I'll comment on it and then I'll
[17:29.880 --> 17:33.640]  get into a story I covered Friday and Sunday but not enough they're coming
[17:33.640 --> 17:37.680]  with forced injections for you and your family and if you don't take them they're
[17:37.680 --> 17:40.440]  gonna take you by armed force and forcibly do it if you resist they're
[17:40.440 --> 17:45.880]  gonna kill you but here's a woman who six months before I've been in a car
[17:45.880 --> 17:50.200]  wreck and then they on her medical history it said that her doctor had put
[17:50.200 --> 17:53.440]  her on some painkillers but she was no longer on them they blood tested her
[17:53.440 --> 17:57.640]  didn't show any of the drugs they still took her child because quote they ask
[17:57.640 --> 18:01.840]  questions and they take your child when you ask questions so you should know
[18:01.840 --> 18:06.240]  how dangerous the hospitals are you should know when you go into them that
[18:06.240 --> 18:10.440]  they've got a quota of children to cease here it is well the birth of a baby
[18:10.440 --> 18:13.760]  should be one of the most exciting moments that a couple will ever
[18:13.760 --> 18:18.480]  experience but an aggressive campaign to screen newborn infants turned that
[18:18.480 --> 18:22.480]  moment into a nightmare for one Indianapolis couple it's a story that
[18:22.480 --> 18:29.160]  you'll see only on 24 hour news 8 this is little Kate Ellis she's healthy and
[18:29.160 --> 18:34.200]  normal but her birth was traumatic for her parents it started just minutes
[18:34.200 --> 18:40.280]  after little Kate was born a doctor walked in and told her that and he was
[18:40.280 --> 18:45.360]  gonna have to minister methadone methadone for a newborn baby new dad Mike
[18:45.360 --> 18:49.800]  Ellis was shocked and then worried about giving such a powerful drug to his
[18:49.800 --> 18:53.760]  daughter a new methadone I've heard in the past that that is for people that
[18:53.760 --> 18:59.240]  have a heroin habit and it's a breath fax me I mean I said no we're not we're
[18:59.240 --> 19:03.480]  not doing that immediately Mike Ellis was in a panic his baby had just been
[19:03.480 --> 19:07.320]  born at the Methodist Towers and a doctor had suggested the baby be placed on
[19:07.320 --> 19:11.440]  methadone he wanted to talk to his pediatrician his wife Shannon was in a
[19:11.440 --> 19:14.920]  panic too but it was her medical history that triggered that methadone
[19:14.920 --> 19:19.800]  suggestion Shannon Ellis says her doctor had prescribed hydrocodone for her
[19:19.800 --> 19:23.760]  after she suffered injuries in a February car accident she and Mike
[19:23.760 --> 19:27.400]  trusted that the prescribed drug wouldn't affect the baby why would you
[19:27.400 --> 19:32.080]  prescribe this to her if this was gonna be an issue what she didn't have an
[19:32.080 --> 19:36.400]  answer for anytime I asked that I said I'm very upset about this if I had to
[19:36.400 --> 19:39.520]  do it all over again I would I would have dealt with the pain it turns out
[19:39.520 --> 19:43.760]  anytime a mother is on a drug prescription or not a doctor can order
[19:43.760 --> 19:48.280]  her newborn be screened and if a parent questions or protests which Mike Ellis
[19:48.280 --> 19:55.480]  did child protective services can be alerted do you know the truth about

[24:04.040 --> 24:12.680]  now you're listening to this newscast I want to tell you what the real policies
[24:12.680 --> 24:20.080]  are when you go into any hospital and it's 50 times worse if you're doing it
[24:20.080 --> 24:26.160]  on welfare and you're white because that baby's worth between 300 and 500 a
[24:26.160 --> 24:31.600]  grand to them and you better just look out and they admit that they can take
[24:31.600 --> 24:36.240]  that child and the different agencies and adoption agencies in some cases now
[24:36.240 --> 24:44.560]  it's up to half a million or even higher just amazing and they love middle class
[24:44.560 --> 24:51.040]  families they love that but if it's a healthy white trash baby guaranteed
[24:51.040 --> 24:53.520]  because because they love it when the parents don't know how to fight and go
[24:53.520 --> 24:59.160]  and they understand they don't know their rights the system they just tell
[24:59.160 --> 25:03.000]  them okay it's all right just sign the papers we're taking the baby just don't
[25:03.000 --> 25:06.760]  say anything you'll you might get it back don't worry and then they just and
[25:06.760 --> 25:10.120]  they did you don't come to the hearings you just stay there we'll work it out
[25:10.120 --> 25:13.680]  with you they suspend rights and they're federally and locally trying to just
[25:13.680 --> 25:19.320]  get to where there's no due process with these fake family courts which in
[25:19.320 --> 25:22.520]  every case we've investigated or run by the pedophile rings that's why they do
[25:22.520 --> 25:26.120]  it they get the added fringe benefit with the poor kids nobody's protecting
[25:26.120 --> 25:30.960]  they do medical experiments on them and also have their rape gangs on them by
[25:30.960 --> 25:33.960]  the way if you're listening for the first time and think I'm exaggerating
[25:33.960 --> 25:39.360]  I'm not they had to shut down two prisons in the last few years just outside
[25:39.360 --> 25:43.120]  Austin where they would systematically rape all the women in videotape it
[25:43.120 --> 25:48.320]  women's presence the Texas Youth Commission at every facility they were
[25:48.320 --> 25:52.080]  raping children at some they were selling them out and had the parking lots
[25:52.080 --> 25:56.640]  full at night of local officials coming to pay to rape the children Texas
[25:56.640 --> 25:59.840]  Rangers for years were told to stand down and again I keep using that example
[25:59.840 --> 26:04.040]  because I live here in Texas I see it you can do a search anywhere Indiana
[26:04.040 --> 26:09.120]  Florida Michigan New York State you know I mentioned their murder in the kids
[26:09.120 --> 26:13.520]  with the pesticide and drug test that's in the news they take them strap them
[26:13.520 --> 26:16.200]  down that's mainly black kids though that's their favorite there for some
[26:16.200 --> 26:20.440]  reason it's kind of grandfathered and they've always been testing bio and
[26:20.440 --> 26:24.440]  chemical weapons on blacks I mean the stuff went on with Tuskegee's nothing
[26:24.440 --> 26:29.000]  it's just that back we weren't as corrupt in the 50s and 60s and then it came
[26:29.000 --> 26:33.120]  out in the 80s and so you heard about Tuskegee and the syphilis and letting
[26:33.120 --> 26:38.160]  them die of it and spread it to hundreds of thousands now it's it's much worse
[26:38.160 --> 26:41.520]  I mean what what's bad letting a black man die syphilis and in some cases in
[26:41.520 --> 26:44.000]  planning them with syphilis and allowing them to give it to others or
[26:44.000 --> 26:49.320]  strapping little black kids down and giving them pesticides till they die
[26:51.800 --> 26:57.440]  it's so amazing oh no your government's good you know that's my whole point here
[26:57.440 --> 27:04.120]  is the government is so corrupt so bankrupt so evil and how this works is
[27:04.120 --> 27:08.520]  it first started with well we'll test mothers we think are at risk for drug
[27:08.520 --> 27:13.360]  use but have a conviction or have a history see when you go into any
[27:13.360 --> 27:17.480]  hospital they have computers hanging on the wall and the nurses your little
[27:17.480 --> 27:21.480]  friend and they they sit them there and you don't know it's really a police
[27:21.480 --> 27:26.920]  officer basically and that you are now confessing yourself but without you
[27:26.920 --> 27:30.760]  then asking they run your social security they run your criminal data bank it goes
[27:30.760 --> 27:34.160]  through the eugenics office the health departments were set up as eugenics
[27:34.160 --> 27:38.920]  offices in the 20s and 30s and they were originally called eugenics offices but
[27:38.920 --> 27:42.200]  it goes through your modern eugenics office the health department that nexus
[27:42.200 --> 27:46.840]  is into the police database but they then ask you questions they go further
[27:46.840 --> 27:53.280]  hadn't he done a work done I sat there while my wife course we all know and we
[27:53.280 --> 27:56.520]  made the decision to not go at home with babies just because the babies we have
[27:56.520 --> 28:01.200]  are so big for some reason and her first pregnancy was real tough so some of my
[28:01.200 --> 28:05.040]  first child was over 10 pounds so we've you know go with the hospital but but we
[28:05.040 --> 28:08.280]  understand that they're all brainwashed cult members they don't even mean bad
[28:08.280 --> 28:10.880]  they're just brainwashed cult members we understand but I'm sitting there while
[28:10.880 --> 28:14.920]  the nurse you know it's always one of the master nurses is mmm-hmm do you have
[28:14.920 --> 28:20.320]  any dental work mmm-hmm what your dentist give you for that mmm-hmm and that's why
[28:20.320 --> 28:23.840]  even though my wife just decided not have dental work even though she had a
[28:23.840 --> 28:28.160]  cavity and had an infection she was afraid she might need painkillers any
[28:28.160 --> 28:32.080]  time in that and that would be filed and we knew the statistics they'd come
[28:32.080 --> 28:35.440]  after our kids so she sat there with pus coming out her mouth everything else
[28:35.440 --> 28:40.520]  because we understand your criminal op we understand your op we understand who
[28:40.520 --> 28:44.840]  you are we know and of it finally she got some dental work done and had a bunch
[28:44.840 --> 28:50.640]  of cavities fixed after that poor thing but listen you're in a car wreck and
[28:50.640 --> 28:53.840]  you're pregnant you do not take painkillers they'll doctors will order you
[28:53.840 --> 28:58.040]  to take them but they're gonna black out your kids so that's the dis info in
[28:58.040 --> 29:02.400]  this story is it wasn't that he questioned that's what the poor dad was
[29:02.400 --> 29:07.120]  told I'm gonna get them on after no the CPS was already called in fact you hear
[29:07.120 --> 29:11.080]  that later they allude to it didn't matter that there was no drugs in her
[29:11.080 --> 29:14.760]  didn't matter there was no drugs in the baby didn't matter if it was legal
[29:14.760 --> 29:18.840]  didn't matter it was six months before they were coming and nothing on earth
[29:18.840 --> 29:24.000]  was gonna stop them and so this is one out of a thousand cases I guarantee you
[29:24.000 --> 29:27.840]  in Indianapolis Indiana that I know they have thousands a year in every
[29:27.840 --> 29:33.000]  major city and so they fought back and got their child back for now CPS is
[29:33.000 --> 29:38.480]  still coming for him but we're gonna break down how this works okay they're
[29:38.480 --> 29:41.280]  right back stay with us

[33:20.880 --> 33:29.520]  it's a death-defying life I lead I take my chances I die for living in the movies
[33:29.520 --> 33:39.160]  and TV but the hardest thing I ever do is watch my leading ladies kiss some other
[33:39.160 --> 33:46.600]  guy while I'm bandaging my knee I might fall from a tall building I might
[33:46.600 --> 33:55.640]  roll a brand-new car cause I'm the unknown stuntman that made Redford such a star
[34:00.640 --> 34:07.680]  I've never spent much time in school but I taught ladies plenty it's true I
[34:07.680 --> 34:15.720]  hire my body out for pay hey hey I've gotten burned over Cheryl T's blown up
[34:15.720 --> 34:24.360]  for Rock L Welch when I wind up in the hay it's only hey hey hey I might jump on
[34:24.360 --> 34:31.520]  an open draw we're back live ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining us as we
[34:31.520 --> 34:35.520]  defend liberty resist tyranny try to wake the public up the fact that a
[34:35.520 --> 34:41.240]  predatory government owned by private predatory corporations is hunting you
[34:41.240 --> 34:46.480]  they suck off of you they milk off heavy it in enough though quite a few of us
[34:46.480 --> 34:50.040]  they actually eat when you get into political world they feed on us they
[34:50.040 --> 34:55.200]  render us down they use us they murder our children they have their way with us
[34:55.200 --> 34:58.920]  they're being trained and more and more savagely attack us we're being programmed
[34:58.920 --> 35:06.120]  that it's okay by this predatory sociopathic psychopathic sadistic class
[35:06.120 --> 35:11.880]  now I want to explain something to they just said on their medical records and
[35:11.880 --> 35:14.560]  the medical record said she'd been in a car wreck and they show the car in the
[35:14.560 --> 35:19.000]  newscast smash completely up the whole side caved in right on the driver's side
[35:19.000 --> 35:25.840]  her Mustang and this nice family they come they grab the child the parents
[35:25.840 --> 35:30.840]  let them grab the child don't even know how you do that I know I'd flip out I'm
[35:30.840 --> 35:34.720]  sure the enemies assessed me and knows that's my weak point but the point is is
[35:34.720 --> 35:40.840]  that and of course the officers desensitized well we gotta do this
[35:40.840 --> 35:44.240]  because all these drug addicts you see it's one thing and they've got a quote
[35:44.240 --> 35:50.680]  drug addict okay and then they know the person's had history being a drug addict
[35:50.680 --> 35:54.160]  and then they still need to inform you under the fourth amendment that they're
[35:54.160 --> 35:57.040]  gonna be taking your blood and using it against you but she these ignorant
[35:57.040 --> 35:59.600]  people don't know that but see now they're done grabbing all the drug addicts
[35:59.600 --> 36:03.360]  kids and then going and putting them on riddling in Prozac and hopping more than
[36:03.360 --> 36:06.520]  two-thirds the foster kids up on drugs and they're five times more likely to
[36:06.520 --> 36:09.360]  abuse than anybody else so it probably better for him to stay with the drug
[36:09.360 --> 36:12.640]  addict and by the way they usually don't even give the children to their
[36:12.640 --> 36:16.080]  family the grandma's and people always want the baby they grab from some you
[36:16.080 --> 36:20.800]  know poor 22 year old woman that got hooked on pain pills and know the family
[36:20.800 --> 36:26.520]  doesn't get them some pedophile another state gets them usually but I'm serious
[36:26.520 --> 36:32.600]  so that's how they operate but in this case no drugs and her no drugs in the
[36:32.600 --> 36:36.920]  baby then I guarantee it's a false test they did some super complex expensive
[36:36.920 --> 36:40.920]  tests to find that yes the baby had quote been exposed not the drugs were in
[36:40.920 --> 36:45.720]  the baby but they do I guess some liver toxicity test to show that the baby had
[36:45.720 --> 36:50.120]  been exposed but actually that they've read that Tylenol taken Tylenol will show
[36:50.120 --> 36:54.200]  that or other chemicals will show that in the liver but but the point is is that
[36:54.200 --> 36:57.640]  she was in a car wreck got her said take this was in her medical records they
[36:57.640 --> 37:02.920]  use that man the CPS came and grabbed the kid the media spends it that oh they
[37:02.920 --> 37:11.440]  came because she had and he had said why are you gonna give the baby methadone
[37:11.440 --> 37:16.400]  that's a serious you know form of basically synthetic heroin which they
[37:16.400 --> 37:23.360]  admit is just as addictive oh how dare you question a god some power trip doctor
[37:23.360 --> 37:28.040]  see a lot of these doctors want the power to force medicine on and they'll
[37:28.040 --> 37:31.760]  use extreme examples you know people that won't take medical care because
[37:31.760 --> 37:36.680]  they're Christian scientists or whatever hey that's freedom if some nuts want to
[37:36.680 --> 37:40.160]  not take medical treatment and that's their problem you know that's what
[37:40.160 --> 37:46.760]  freedom's all about and again I'm for reasonable things like somebody's legs
[37:46.760 --> 37:50.120]  broken they need medical treatment but see they it's never gonna be reasonable
[37:50.120 --> 37:53.480]  the road to hell is paved with good intentions that's what that means and
[37:53.480 --> 37:56.600]  then you got the government grabbing the black kids and testing pesticides on
[37:56.600 --> 38:02.440]  until they die it's I'm gonna get into that later let's go ahead and finish up
[38:02.440 --> 38:07.280]  with this piece if a parent questions or protests which Mike Ellis did child
[38:07.280 --> 38:11.600]  protective services can be alerted and the state takes action back at the
[38:11.600 --> 38:16.600]  hospital a urine drug screen result on baby Kate was negative but it was
[38:16.600 --> 38:20.680]  already too late child protective services was in the process of taking
[38:20.680 --> 38:24.920]  custody of her away from Mike and Shannon Ellis again all the Ellis has
[38:24.920 --> 38:29.520]  had to do to raise suspicion and get the state involved was simply asked for
[38:29.520 --> 38:33.920]  their own doctor's second opinion on whether it was necessary to give their
[38:33.920 --> 38:38.760]  baby the powerful drug let's stop right there it is your right under the Bill
[38:38.760 --> 38:44.660]  of Rights under common law to say I want a second opinion but again the ego
[38:44.660 --> 38:49.520]  maniacs had already called the CPS they love stomping around in their self
[38:49.520 --> 38:52.640]  important way so just know that when you're in there and the nurse is typing
[38:52.640 --> 38:55.840]  in that computer it's all going to the cops and then they'll always try to
[38:55.840 --> 38:59.600]  trick the man out of the room will you take this file downstairs for me thank
[38:59.600 --> 39:03.560]  you and then oh hun we don't like them in the room we asked this are you in a
[39:03.560 --> 39:07.280]  safe environment you got plenty of money plenty of food he didn't yell at you
[39:07.280 --> 39:11.000]  does he and women you know like to be friendly to other women and then so
[39:11.000 --> 39:15.280]  she'll say well sometimes we yell but you know he's getting better that's
[39:15.280 --> 39:22.360]  completely normal mammals always fight with each other canines do it seals do
[39:22.360 --> 39:27.480]  it whales do it gone your life's over your kid is going to be drugged out
[39:27.480 --> 39:31.320]  having seizures by the time they're 10 passed around every pedophile ring and
[39:31.320 --> 39:34.360]  you're in the in whatever city they shut them to it's over your life's over
[39:34.360 --> 39:38.680]  black ops win they have their way million and a half kids in their rape
[39:38.680 --> 39:45.640]  centers every year the government isn't credible their criminals they've been
[39:45.640 --> 39:50.760]  caught nothing's more criminal no one's more corrupt no one lies more no one is
[39:50.760 --> 39:55.320]  more bankrupt as the founding fathers told you the best government's dangerous
[39:55.320 --> 39:58.760]  and got to be totally controlled and watched the most dangerous thing there
[39:58.760 --> 40:04.200]  is in society and 99% of the time as a founding fathers told you well well
[40:04.200 --> 40:08.720]  they called a free country and a place that had some liberty the most rare
[40:08.720 --> 40:13.480]  jewel to be guarded and anyone that approaches it must be killed immediately
[40:13.480 --> 40:17.880]  that's by the way a thomas jefferson paraphrase talks about killing anybody
[40:17.880 --> 40:23.760]  that approaches the precious jewel some call it the phantom jewel that's another
[40:23.760 --> 40:28.560]  quote by other founding father is the ultimate treasure because from it flows
[40:28.560 --> 40:35.880]  free market milk and honey happy families the strongest people just play
[40:35.880 --> 40:41.040]  the rest of the trash drug methadone judge maryland moors did not rule
[40:41.040 --> 40:45.880]  directly in this case but she heads up the maryon county juvenile court because
[40:45.880 --> 40:53.400]  of the just a huge number of children that we are seeing who are born exposed
[40:53.400 --> 40:59.360]  or addicted to drugs and what it's not right there that can more than two
[40:59.360 --> 41:03.120]  thirds of the children nationwide you can pull that up percentage of foster
[41:03.120 --> 41:07.480]  children on psychotropic drugs more than two thirds are on it and the average
[41:07.480 --> 41:12.080]  child is on seven drugs and then that's how it works and by then they start
[41:12.080 --> 41:15.120]  having seizures because the drugs are so toxic and then they go ahead and give
[41:15.120 --> 41:19.720]  you seizure drugs and then by the time they've pumped you dry in the system
[41:19.720 --> 41:23.440]  that's most of people you see talking to themselves on the street corner I've
[41:23.440 --> 41:28.280]  talked to him I'm gonna tell me your life story they took me from my mama she
[41:28.280 --> 41:32.960]  was a drinker they took me and then they put me in the state school and they
[41:32.960 --> 41:38.800]  remember when I was little I played soccer I was doing good and I'm not even
[41:38.800 --> 41:42.160]  putting words in my they go tell me more tell me about the medications when
[41:42.160 --> 41:50.480]  you put on them when I was sick I cried they said I was depressed you can
[41:50.480 --> 41:53.440]  follow back if you track them back you can find their files who they were
[41:53.440 --> 41:58.320]  happy little children shine in eyes a whole life ahead of them and then the
[41:58.320 --> 42:03.040]  military industrial black op death complex got them by the time they're 20
[42:03.040 --> 42:08.400]  they throw them out on the street minds completely shot most of them shock
[42:08.400 --> 42:13.520]  therapy they still lobotomize a lot of them hey you're gonna watch the black
[42:13.520 --> 42:17.160]  and white films of lobotomies you got to watch the psychiatrist who invented it
[42:17.160 --> 42:20.640]  laughing as he jams an ice pick in somebody's head and you and just laughs
[42:20.640 --> 42:25.480]  going you didn't know that was it see it was the joke for them to do that right
[42:25.480 --> 42:29.160]  in front everybody just just stick an ice pick right in your head just yeah
[42:29.160 --> 42:32.720]  right and and then you and you can go watch the black and white films and you
[42:32.720 --> 42:40.600]  see the all the sicko graduate students going oh it's the power a power to strap
[42:40.600 --> 42:44.520]  a kid down in New York City and give them pesticides will they die over three
[42:44.520 --> 42:54.480]  months the power of satan and evil what else do you want to call that you're
[42:54.480 --> 42:57.160]  not going to go YouTube or you're not going to go get documentaries on the
[42:57.160 --> 43:00.680]  history of psychiatry their own you're not going to believe me you're not going
[43:00.680 --> 43:05.720]  to believe they jam ice picks into the front of people's brains and laugh for
[43:05.720 --> 43:10.080]  their own petty power their own sick thrill guaranteed they were killing
[43:10.080 --> 43:13.120]  animals and they were little kids torturing puppies in the backyard now
[43:13.120 --> 43:18.160]  they get to do it to young people pit demons by the way I got a lot I want to
[43:18.160 --> 43:21.200]  say call Jones see we can get him on 15 after I got a bunch of the stuff I want
[43:21.200 --> 43:27.840]  to get to move move professor Jones we can't 15 minutes back because I got a
[43:27.840 --> 43:30.880]  lot I got to get to and I'm kind of getting stuck on this go ahead and roll
[43:30.880 --> 43:36.000]  the rest of it and what a devastating thing that can be for children and how
[43:36.000 --> 43:42.200]  hard it is to find them after the fact see stop right there how hard it is to
[43:42.200 --> 43:47.040]  find the children who mother was in a car wreck and was on drugs but isn't now
[43:47.040 --> 43:54.160]  that the doctors put her on that doesn't even hurt the baby see they push this
[43:54.160 --> 44:00.080]  stuff on everybody I mean I remember the time I broke my leg I'd have surgery I
[44:00.080 --> 44:04.520]  didn't even take the first bottle of pills my wife didn't even take the
[44:04.520 --> 44:08.800]  Lassiserian she had a whole bottle of pills
[44:09.080 --> 44:12.700]  it's unbelievable by the way you take those pills and you put to them in your
[44:12.700 --> 44:16.360]  lunchbox because you had a root canal and they pull you over and find it in
[44:16.360 --> 44:20.120]  your lunchbox you got to have the pills on you go to prison for that this
[44:20.120 --> 44:24.000]  system's designed to catch you the prey and put you on the government dinner
[44:24.000 --> 44:29.480]  table so back to this slime ball judge these people make me sick they want
[44:29.480 --> 44:36.280]  your kids they can hop them up on drugs bottom line go ahead back to it the
[44:36.280 --> 44:41.760]  system reacts pretty quickly it was too quick for the LSS and as they saw it
[44:41.760 --> 44:45.960]  unfair if it's something that they do right there they always call everything
[44:45.960 --> 44:52.920]  unfair what was that newscast I was playing last week where they were
[44:52.920 --> 44:57.080]  harassing and attacking everybody and they and and and sucking your blood out
[44:57.080 --> 45:00.480]  on the side of the highway without a warrant and they said it's unfair see
[45:00.480 --> 45:04.080]  they never teach you it's your rights it's against your rights now they've
[45:04.080 --> 45:08.000]  moved into it's unfair see people seeing this newscast would think the news was
[45:08.000 --> 45:11.880]  on their side really an acclamation at the end says well it is for the better
[45:11.880 --> 45:16.620]  men of the children yeah that's right so the dirt bags that run government can
[45:16.620 --> 45:19.520]  have their way with these babies in these facilities after they're done
[45:19.520 --> 45:23.560]  raping your baby they then charge you with it go back to it unfair if it's
[45:23.560 --> 45:27.960]  something that they do with everybody in the state of Indiana okay but that's
[45:27.960 --> 45:33.080]  not the case stop see they say oh it's okay just search everybody on the streets
[45:33.080 --> 45:36.600]  and the airports and you don't have a fourth member for everybody but don't
[45:36.600 --> 45:41.160]  profile and then they go on to say if it's okay for everybody in Indiana then
[45:41.160 --> 45:46.080]  I'm for it don't fall into that trap no you don't do it without due process and
[45:46.080 --> 45:51.600]  probable cause I mean this all started 50 years ago with the woman didn't have
[45:51.600 --> 45:55.600]  any teeth and had tattoos and her husband was you know just threatening her
[45:55.600 --> 45:59.880]  in front of the nurses and go and give me some more liquor and the baby looked
[45:59.880 --> 46:05.820]  all unhealthy you then have an investigator come in before it was
[46:05.820 --> 46:09.760]  criminal for they had the eugenics squads out and they'd say you know have
[46:09.760 --> 46:12.480]  you and they'd run them and then see if they had any drug convictions and then
[46:12.480 --> 46:16.440]  they take a blood test but see now but by the way there's lies within lies here
[46:16.440 --> 46:21.640]  everyone is tested and screened for drugs but see they can't really tell you
[46:21.640 --> 46:25.520]  that publicly because that is a violation of the Fourth Amendment but so so they
[46:25.520 --> 46:28.480]  just do it just like they take your blood samples I've been telling you for 10
[46:28.480 --> 46:31.360]  years since I learned of it and had congressman on about it that everywhere
[46:31.360 --> 46:35.520]  in the Western world for 35 years they had been taking your blood at Barth and
[46:35.520 --> 46:38.580]  putting it in an international database now because people got mad because I
[46:38.580 --> 46:41.800]  warned them they went ahead and passed a law three weeks ago or I guess a month
[46:41.800 --> 46:45.400]  ago now saying they can do that now you can't pass a law that violates the
[46:45.400 --> 46:50.160]  Bill of Rights see they take your blood at Barth they test you at Barth they
[46:50.160 --> 46:54.120]  test the mother at Barth they do what they want they run the daddy's criminal
[46:54.120 --> 47:00.400]  record and use that to see PS kids and say they're at risk they're a criminal
[47:00.400 --> 47:08.320]  dirt bag government back to it okay but that's not the case I mean they
[47:08.320 --> 47:13.760]  cornered her immediately for something they prescribed for her and treated her
[47:13.760 --> 47:18.360]  like she's a drug addict infant drug screenings are not mandatory for all
[47:18.360 --> 47:23.080]  babies born in Indiana and not all Indianapolis hospitals do them so the
[47:23.080 --> 47:27.280]  state removed baby Kate from her parents and placed her in foster care
[47:27.280 --> 47:32.760]  remember the urine test for hydrocodone in the baby system was negative the
[47:32.760 --> 47:37.160]  Alice's had to go to court to get their baby back which meant more of a burden
[47:37.160 --> 47:41.600]  we're gonna sell her vehicle to be able to get an attorney to be able to go
[47:41.600 --> 47:45.160]  fight to get our daughter back three days later the Alice's were in juvenile
[47:45.160 --> 47:49.400]  court and the news was good the judges ordered the release of the hot of the
[47:49.400 --> 47:54.800]  child back to mr. Mrs. Ellis so did the Alice's do anything wrong I think the
[47:54.800 --> 47:58.680]  mistake was made in that they were not advised of the potential need for this
[47:58.680 --> 48:04.400]  treatment and the reasons for there you go there you go degenerate criminals you
[48:04.400 --> 48:09.800]  say my you want to give my baby we don't use heroin you and the doctor
[48:09.800 --> 48:13.880]  wouldn't even talk to him because he'd already called CPS well I want to get
[48:13.880 --> 48:18.120]  another doctor in here you're not doing nothing officers walk in hands at guns
[48:18.120 --> 48:25.840]  and tasers make one move buddy one move the Saudis paid top dollar and of
[48:25.840 --> 48:29.200]  course the dumb cops don't know that the idiot do-gooder little doctor doesn't
[48:29.200 --> 48:36.680]  know that remember the woman just had her wisdom teeth pulled and she had to
[48:36.680 --> 48:42.200]  pick her daughter up at school you know part-day school a four-year-old this was
[48:42.200 --> 48:46.320]  in Phoenix she pulls in has two glasses of water at the restaurant they serve
[48:46.320 --> 48:51.880]  water and wine glasses the guy follows her to the mall where she picked up
[48:51.880 --> 48:58.080]  bath salts go home and take a bath and yep she had taken one hydrocodone but
[48:58.080 --> 49:08.040]  not even yet she had taken it in the car coming back out of the car going from
[49:08.040 --> 49:11.720]  the mall the police were waiting they admitted she just taken the pill she
[49:11.720 --> 49:16.920]  timed it to go home get in the bath and they went ahead and arrested her for DWI
[49:16.920 --> 49:23.240]  didn't have alcohol of course this is in the news but got her now on narcotics
[49:23.240 --> 49:27.680]  driving under narcotics they're trying to take her kid and she's lost her job and
[49:27.680 --> 49:34.800]  her whole life's over black ops successful well done and it's all
[49:34.800 --> 49:38.160]  selectively enforced the illegal aliens are above the law all the rest of it they
[49:38.160 --> 49:42.360]  do what they want when they want how they want and if you think that's bad
[49:42.360 --> 49:49.200]  it's just beginning I want to get into we get back up and talking about since
[49:49.200 --> 49:53.760]  Friday they want to pass a law to forcibly inject you and give you whatever
[49:53.760 --> 49:59.280]  vaccines they want whenever they want including adults and they're saying that
[49:59.280 --> 50:04.760]  if you don't they will send police and if you resist you will be killed that's
[50:04.760 --> 50:08.800]  what happens imagine land of the free home of the brave you won't take the
[50:08.800 --> 50:12.040]  injections which they admit are filled with mercury cancer viruses toxins
[50:12.040 --> 50:15.080]  everything else the government now admits full of mercury caused all the
[50:15.080 --> 50:18.280]  autism they're not even denying it now for all the debunkers you've been
[50:18.280 --> 50:21.720]  disproven again government multiple court hearings signed up reports it's all

[50:36.360 --> 50:39.840]  arrest people for their kids not taking shots when there's not even a law the
[50:39.840 --> 50:45.000]  government is so lawless so evil and they've got all these brainwashed chumps
[50:45.000 --> 50:54.160]  working for them I don't even know it just keep pushing keep pushing it is a

[52:27.120 --> 52:31.480]  napkin in the greatest story ever told we are told that the tomb was found
[52:31.480 --> 52:37.000]  empty on the third day say for the watered-up grave wrapping cloth and the
[52:37.000 --> 52:42.120]  folded napkin it says and I read and he's stooping down looking in saw the
[52:42.120 --> 52:48.480]  linen cloth lying yet he not in then come a Simon Peter following him and went
[52:48.480 --> 52:54.040]  into the sepulcher and see if the linen cloth lie and the napkin that was about
[52:54.040 --> 52:58.840]  his head not lying with the linen cloth but wrapped together in a place by
[52:58.840 --> 53:03.520]  itself we all know the meaning of the empty tomb the greatest story teller
[53:03.520 --> 53:09.040]  arose from the grave the stone tomb but before he left it he took time to fold

[54:07.000 --> 54:11.000]  Front porch sittin' in an old rockin' chair
[54:13.000 --> 54:16.000]  The sun is hot in the Texas sky
[54:19.000 --> 54:23.000]  Garden growin', clothes out on a line
[54:25.000 --> 54:28.000]  A dusty road when a car goes by
[54:28.000 --> 54:34.000]  Story fell out of days long ago
[54:37.000 --> 54:40.000]  And the only place she'd ever been
[54:43.000 --> 54:47.000]  Singin' softly, this world is not my home
[54:49.000 --> 54:52.000]  And memories take me back again
[54:52.000 --> 54:58.000]  When I was young and Grandma wasn't home
[55:00.000 --> 55:04.000]  When she guided me as I watched life unfold
[55:05.000 --> 55:07.000]  Yep, we sure have fallen, haven't we?
[55:07.000 --> 55:12.000]  Anything we didn't have, we didn't really need to hold
[55:12.000 --> 55:16.000]  When I was young and Grandma wasn't home
[55:16.000 --> 55:22.000]  All right, the next story is one that we've been coverin' since Friday,
[55:22.000 --> 55:27.000]  but it's just so huge that really we could spend months on this.
[55:27.000 --> 55:34.000]  It's so big, headlin' up on infowars.net.
[55:35.000 --> 55:40.000]  Worst vaccine bill ever seeks compulsory shots for all children.
[55:40.000 --> 55:42.000]  Again, infowars.net.
[55:42.000 --> 55:47.000]  Read the bill, it's in New York State, they're tryin' similar stuff nationwide.
[55:47.000 --> 55:52.000]  10942, introduce the request of Richard Danes,
[55:52.000 --> 55:55.000]  the commissioner of the New York State Department of Health.
[55:55.000 --> 56:01.000]  These are the folks that grab the kids for medical testing.
[56:01.000 --> 56:02.000]  God, they're evil.
[56:02.000 --> 56:08.000]  Calls for changes to the law in order to make recommended inoculation compulsory
[56:08.000 --> 56:11.000]  in order for children to attend school.
[56:11.000 --> 56:15.000]  But then when you actually read the bill, it says it's for everybody,
[56:16.000 --> 56:20.000]  including all women for human papillomavirus.
[56:22.000 --> 56:28.000]  When they admit, go to Gardasil's own website, that it doesn't even protect you from it.
[56:28.000 --> 56:31.000]  They say, well, we think it might help with a few strains,
[56:31.000 --> 56:35.000]  four to six of 350 strains that we believe are associated with cancer.
[56:35.000 --> 56:40.000]  But we do know that if you take the vaccine and already have the virus,
[56:40.000 --> 56:44.000]  that there's a 45% increase in you getting the cancer.
[56:44.000 --> 56:47.000]  And the average idiot, I've seen on the news,
[56:47.000 --> 56:50.000]  thinks this is a shot of vaccine for all cancer.
[56:50.000 --> 56:51.000]  Just unbelievable.
[56:51.000 --> 56:54.000]  By the way, it's a live cancer virus.
[56:54.000 --> 56:56.000]  Most cancer is from viruses.
[56:56.000 --> 56:59.000]  Most of the cancer we've got now is from the shots.
[56:59.000 --> 57:02.000]  We've gone from one in 33 dyin' of it to one in three.
[57:02.000 --> 57:05.000]  They're talkin' about one in two now.
[57:05.000 --> 57:09.000]  Keep takin' your shots though the government loves ya, I know.
[57:09.000 --> 57:11.000]  So you just can't get your mind around how evil they are,
[57:11.000 --> 57:16.000]  or how the locals are compartmentalized and think they're doin' good.
[57:16.000 --> 57:20.000]  The elected Newark representatives would no longer determine the mandatory schedule
[57:20.000 --> 57:22.000]  for vaccines to attend schools.
[57:22.000 --> 57:26.000]  And by mandatory, they claim it's mandatory to attend, but there's a waiver.
[57:26.000 --> 57:29.000]  Decisions made by the Federal Advisory Committee on Immunization
[57:29.000 --> 57:31.000]  practices would automatically become mandatory.
[57:31.000 --> 57:34.000]  So the state's put you under the feds.
[57:34.000 --> 57:37.000]  All children, infants, and toddlers included
[57:37.000 --> 57:40.000]  in New York would be required to get all vaccines recommended
[57:40.000 --> 57:43.000]  by the ACIP according to the ACIP schedule.
[57:43.000 --> 57:46.000]  So forcing all the babies to have the shots,
[57:46.000 --> 57:48.000]  you think they already tried to take your kids when you don't now,
[57:48.000 --> 57:50.000]  and there's no law, because they're crooks.
[57:50.000 --> 57:53.000]  Now the crooks are gettin' caught, so they're tryin' to pass a law,
[57:53.000 --> 57:55.000]  which is still a criminal law.
[57:55.000 --> 57:58.000]  All children, infants, and toddlers included in New York
[57:58.000 --> 58:01.000]  would be required to get all vaccines recommended by the ACIP.
[58:01.000 --> 58:03.000]  There's already over 50 of them, quote, recommended,
[58:03.000 --> 58:04.000]  but see now it's the law.
[58:04.000 --> 58:05.000]  But here's the bigger issue.
[58:05.000 --> 58:08.000]  A lot of you are going, wait a minute, they already said it's a lot of take shots.
[58:08.000 --> 58:11.000]  See, there's no law, folks.
[58:11.000 --> 58:13.000]  See, that shows they're bad.
[58:13.000 --> 58:14.000]  That's the proof right there.
[58:14.000 --> 58:18.000]  They lie. They lie to you.
[58:18.000 --> 58:19.000]  I'm gonna come back, get to this,
[58:19.000 --> 58:22.000]  finish up with somebody screaming and yelling at me.
[58:22.000 --> 58:25.000]  Amazing YouTube clip showing the true ignorance we're facing.
[58:25.000 --> 58:36.000]  Then Professor Stephen Jones and a lot more, stay with me.

[59:57.000 --> 59:59.000]  Government cover-ups.
[59:59.000 --> 1:00:01.000]  You want answers?
[1:00:01.000 --> 1:00:02.000]  Well, so does he.
[1:00:02.000 --> 1:00:06.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:06.000 --> 1:00:14.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:14.000 --> 1:00:19.000]  When the criminal government from Illinois to Texas pulls you over
[1:00:19.000 --> 1:00:23.000]  and tries to take blood from you without a warrant,
[1:00:23.000 --> 1:00:27.000]  they claim they're doing it for the prevailing interest of the state.
[1:00:27.000 --> 1:00:32.000]  The state means the criminal foreign corporations that own our governments.
[1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:40.000]  And they've had the United States in emergency restructuring under asset forfeiture since 1933.
[1:00:40.000 --> 1:00:42.000]  So they're just squeezing their animals.
[1:00:42.000 --> 1:00:44.000]  They call us human resources.
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:50.000]  And under international treaty, we are sold as chattel slaves.
[1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:53.000]  We're referred to as property of the state.
[1:00:53.000 --> 1:00:57.000]  And they're just now, they've got us trained to how to be, look for handouts,
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:01:04.000]  how to be cowardly, how to be weak, how to have our rights violated, how to squeal and fear.
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:10.000]  We are the land of the coward, the home of the slaves, from land of the free home of the brave.
[1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:16.000]  From the country of Smedley Butler and Chuck Yeager and
[1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:20.000]  all the things personified by the image of somebody like John Wayne.
[1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  We're the opposite.
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:28.000]  Not all of us are, but we're in a sea of weak cowards who have no idea they're going to the slaughter
[1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  or thug-like little weaklings who love power.
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:42.000]  Huge armies of parasites, propagandizing and feeding on us.
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:52.000]  And all over the nation, every school year, it starts up in July, goes through August,
[1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:54.000]  into the first days of school.
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:01:58.000]  There'll be announcements all over Austin Radio, all over Austin TV.
[1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:01.000]  I'll see hundreds of newscasts online, every TV station in the country.
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:05.000]  We'll say it's the law, no shots, you go to jail.
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:10.000]  Officers are getting tough on those that endanger the rest of the community.
[1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:14.000]  Of course, if the vaccines are supposedly protecting all of you that take it,
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  why are you endangered by us not taking it?
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  See, that's another lie.
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:27.000]  You see, you can get into all the statistics, actually disease went up after vaccines.
[1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:31.000]  It went down with hygiene and indoor plumbing.
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:34.000]  And then it actually went back up some.
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:36.000]  It's the same graph in the entire Western world.
[1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:38.000]  The graph is almost identical.
[1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:40.000]  But forget graphs and facts and stuff.
[1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:45.000]  Just roll your sleeves up, enjoy all the autism and cancer.
[1:02:45.000 --> 1:02:49.000]  Of course, it's admitted that most of the cancers that are viral are from vaccines.
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:53.000]  That's actually admitted in government reports and everything.
[1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:57.000]  Just like I told you, mercury was causing most of the autism and now it's totally admitted.
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:03:02.000]  You know, just don't listen to me, go ahead, roll your sleeve up.
[1:03:02.000 --> 1:03:04.000]  You know, I'm a weirdo.
[1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:07.000]  I get upset by the fact that they're injecting us with cancer viruses
[1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:09.000]  and I yell and scream to try to wake you up.
[1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:10.000]  I'm bad.
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:11.000]  Don't listen to me.
[1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:14.000]  You know, I make everything up.
[1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:15.000]  I'm anti-American.
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:19.000]  I'm scum because I don't want to lose our country and our sovereignty
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:23.000]  and our currency and our name and our future.
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:25.000]  I'm not a good globalist.
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:28.000]  I'm bad.
[1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  I mean, think about this.
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:32.000]  The government saying, we'll medicate your water with sodium fluoride
[1:03:32.000 --> 1:03:34.000]  and they admit they do and they say it's forced medication
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:38.000]  and we'll forcibly inject you and we'll forcibly take your blood
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  and we'll forcibly do whatever we want because this is a free country
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:44.000]  and we're the government and we know best.
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:48.000]  Meanwhile, the government's a bunch of psychopathic eugenicists on top
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:51.000]  saying they want to kill us and in government reports saying
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:57.000]  they wanted to poison the vaccines and then lo and behold, they've done it.
[1:03:57.000 --> 1:04:04.000]  And I have all the documentation and now they're saying that you will be arrested
[1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:10.000]  if this passes and that they will come and arrest you if all women
[1:04:10.000 --> 1:04:17.000]  from five years of age to 18 will have to have this.
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:20.000]  All the sexually transmitted, quote, vaccines,
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:22.000]  all these other dangerous experimental vaccines,
[1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  they're saying all the kids, even if you don't go to public school
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:29.000]  and they're going to, you watch, cops, if they pass this,
[1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:34.000]  are going to come and they're going to forcibly shoot you up.
[1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:36.000]  God.
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  And I'm sorry for the cops because there's going to be shootouts.
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:48.000]  Watch.
[1:05:18.000 --> 1:05:22.000]  From hijackers being trained at U.S. military bases to bombs in the buildings,
[1:05:22.000 --> 1:05:26.000]  Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:44.000]  We're in a no-holds-far information war.

[1:05:48.000 --> 1:05:50.000]  to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:54.000]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water
[1:05:54.000 --> 1:05:57.000]  and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals
[1:05:57.000 --> 1:06:00.000]  while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:03.000]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate
[1:06:03.000 --> 1:06:05.000]  and others are absorbed into the skin.
[1:06:05.000 --> 1:06:09.000]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water
[1:06:09.000 --> 1:06:12.000]  and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury and iron,
[1:06:12.000 --> 1:06:16.000]  and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus.

[1:06:20.000 --> 1:06:22.000]  or one year whichever comes first.
[1:06:22.000 --> 1:06:26.000]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine,
[1:06:26.000 --> 1:06:28.000]  iron, heavy metals and bacteria.

[1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:52.000]  He's the T-Rex of Political Talk.
[1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:56.000]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:07:56.000 --> 1:08:03.000]  Okay, this is a clip of some kid out with yeses about 16-17.
[1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:06.000]  This is about par for the course.
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:08.000]  I see these every week.
[1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:12.000]  He's got a bunch of other clips saying torture is good.
[1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:14.000]  Police states good.
[1:08:14.000 --> 1:08:16.000]  It's pro-America.
[1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:20.000]  We got to do it to fight al-Qaeda.
[1:08:20.000 --> 1:08:24.000]  He goes on to say that I'm absolute scum of the earth trader,
[1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:28.000]  that I hate America, that I'm making money off 9-11.
[1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:34.000]  I'm not the one that's the bin Laden's that made $3 billion the first six months after 9-11 with Carl Algrove.
[1:08:34.000 --> 1:08:39.000]  I'm not the one like Giuliani that's made over $80 million on it now.
[1:08:39.000 --> 1:08:44.000]  I'm not the defense contractors who wrote policy papers saying they needed wars
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:47.000]  for trillions of no-bed contracts and oil.
[1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:50.000]  So it's just absolute, like I don't have my political view.
[1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:53.000]  Like I can't write a book or make a film about my views.
[1:08:53.000 --> 1:08:57.000]  They always, it's just idiotic arguments.
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:09:02.000]  And just how I'm America hating scum.
[1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:04.000]  This person, of course, means well.
[1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:08.000]  They're just so ignorant and have no idea what's happening.
[1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:10.000]  One video is just titled Alex Jones.
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:13.000]  It's got another one titled Waterboarding.
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:15.000]  Play the waterboarding one.
[1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:21.000]  In today's Gospel, we will be talking about the torture technique known as waterboarding.
[1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:24.000]  I believe that we all know what waterboarding is,
[1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  but for those at home who don't, it's when a prisoner is held down.
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:29.000]  Here, stop now.
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:32.000]  See, Rumsfeld came out and said they were torturing the news.
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:35.000]  So they were torturing when they'd all scared us a few months after the attack
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:38.000]  and people kind of got sold on it.
[1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  But your bosses, the people you love, Bush and the rest of these big government pimps
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:48.000]  who are destroying our country, just like the Democrats are, don't you dare call me a liberal.
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:52.000]  When you're a false little paradigm, they say it isn't torture.
[1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:55.000]  But wait a minute, you're saying it is torture.
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:56.000]  All officially.
[1:09:56.000 --> 1:10:00.000]  You know, I got a feeling bad stuff is going to happen to this guy in his life with the system.
[1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:05.000]  And then he'll wake up, then he'll find out it isn't like a movie. We're the good guys.
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:08.000]  Everybody else is the bad guys.
[1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:11.000]  In fact, usually it was, you know, the good, the bad and the ugly.
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:12.000]  Some were good, some were bad.
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:16.000]  Now we are the bad guys, instead of just being like everybody else.
[1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:20.000]  So because we've been sold by the bad guys on evil.
[1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:23.000]  So to start him over, you know, he's saying it's torture.
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  But your bosses say it isn't torture.
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:26.000]  Go ahead.
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:31.000]  In today's gospel, we will be talking about the torture technique known as waterboarding.
[1:10:31.000 --> 1:10:36.000]  I believe that we all know what waterboarding is, but for those at home who don't,
[1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:43.000]  it's when a prisoner is held down and gallons of water is forced down their throats in order to extract information.
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:47.000]  This is usually used as an interrogation technique during a time of war.
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  All right, stop right there.
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:54.000]  Hey, punk, if you forced gallons down somebody's throat, their stomach would explode.
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:56.000]  And that is a form of Chinese torture and they would die.
[1:10:56.000 --> 1:10:58.000]  So number one, get that right.
[1:10:58.000 --> 1:11:05.000]  Number two, Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, all of them told the troops never torture anyone.
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:11.000]  It's totally anti-liberty and freedom and despicable and it gives you bad information.
[1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:15.000]  Torture is only good if you want false confessions for propaganda.
[1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:19.000]  Remember other countries, the North Koreans, the North Vietnamese would torture,
[1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:23.000]  the Soviets would torture, the Nazis would torture, but they all did it secretly.
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:27.000]  Only our criminal government would admit it.
[1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:30.000]  So see, you're on the side of history with all the bad guys.
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:33.000]  You're young, you haven't been through anything yet.
[1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:35.000]  I bet you haven't even gone through boot camp yet.
[1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:38.000]  You look like you're just, I guarantee this kid's ROTC.
[1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:42.000]  And in most of these little soft types that get into it, end up washing out.
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:46.000]  When they first really get screamed at or slapped upside the head, he'll probably poop all over himself.
[1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:48.000]  Go ahead and go to this coward.
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:54.000]  And recent controversy has occurred of the U.S. military doing this to terrorist suspects
[1:11:54.000 --> 1:11:58.000]  at the terrorist camp at Guantanamo Bay.
[1:11:58.000 --> 1:12:03.000]  We, as a nation, need to fight terrorism by any means necessary.
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:10.000]  And waterboarding, to me, is probably one of the simplest and probably less painful
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:12.000]  and techniques there is.
[1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:16.000]  It simulates drowning. It isn't drowning.
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:19.000]  Terrorists, one of our guys...
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:22.000]  Stop him. Stop the idiot.
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:27.000]  The way the media introduced waterboarding is the field manual waterboarding,
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:32.000]  putting a rag over the face and the nose and the mouth, pouring water over it so you can't breathe,
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:34.000]  and you are beginning to exfixiate.
[1:12:34.000 --> 1:12:36.000]  If you keep doing it, they would die.
[1:12:36.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  So you are doing it.
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:42.000]  The way they do it in a laboratory or a facility is,
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:47.000]  you put on a sliding gurney and your head is slid up to your soldiers,
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:50.000]  and then you suck in water and they pull it out.
[1:12:50.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  If you see the born ultimatum or you see conspiracy theory with Mel Gibson,
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:13:00.000]  you know, better yet, you want to see waterboarding?
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:02.000]  Go rent a movie.
[1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:04.000]  It was sent to me. I'd read about it.
[1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:07.000]  The Battle of Algiers, which won a bunch of awards.
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:08.000]  It's the military that saw it.
[1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:10.000]  Some people saw it and said it looked like what actually happened.
[1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:13.000]  It was so well done. People seeing it thought it was reality.
[1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:14.000]  They thought it was a documentary.
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:16.000]  But it shows waterboarding in that.
[1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:20.000]  It's the good old stick in your head and a big old sister in a water drowning somebody.
[1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:24.000]  So get that straight to punk. Go back to him.
[1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:30.000]  Terrorists, when one of our guys is captured in Iraq or Afghanistan by the terrorists,
[1:13:30.000 --> 1:13:32.000]  God only knows what they do to them.
[1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:36.000]  It could include electrocution, disembowelment or anything else,
[1:13:36.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  cutting off fingers, toes, anything.
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:42.000]  Let's stop right there.
[1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  No, foreign countries and enemies rarely did that because they knew it escalated the violence continuum.
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:56.000]  You see, once they torture us, we then might do that to them.
[1:13:56.000 --> 1:13:59.000]  Now you've green-lighted it, we've lost the high ground,
[1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:03.000]  and every expert agrees this is going to increase torture worldwide.
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:05.000]  Wrong again, punk. Back to him.
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:10.000]  We believe that terrorists are humane enough that they should be treated as such.
[1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:15.000]  Terrorists are not soldiers. They're anarchists and they're gangsters.
[1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:22.000]  The Geneva Convention says that to be protected under its law of treatment of POWs in war,
[1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:25.000]  they have to have a name, rank and serial number,
[1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:30.000]  and have to be part of an official military and wear the official uniform.
[1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:32.000]  All right, I'm going to play more of this later.
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  Yeah, and in those same White House memos directed by Bush,
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:42.000]  it says torture two-year-olds with pliers by ripping their genitals off.
[1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:47.000]  So you need to go listen to John Yoo at the CFR being questioned and agreeing that they can do that.
[1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:52.000]  You need to face the torture of children because once you do any means necessary,
[1:14:52.000 --> 1:14:55.000]  that's what John Yoo said, and Albert Gonzalez said,
[1:14:55.000 --> 1:14:58.000]  and yes, sir, they did rape children in front of their parents.
[1:14:58.000 --> 1:15:00.000]  That finally came out in the paper.
[1:15:00.000 --> 1:15:03.000]  I couldn't believe it. I hardly ever see anything good in the Austin American statesman.
[1:15:03.000 --> 1:15:07.000]  And here it was Sunday, June 1st, insight section.
[1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:10.000]  Filmmaker, Errol Morris, I'm going to get him on.
[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:16.000]  The Abu Ghraib photos concealed him as much as they revealed and helped cover up the larger truth, and that's right.
[1:15:16.000 --> 1:15:21.000]  CBS, we know, leaked those through the government on purpose, the government through them,
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:26.000]  to minimize because they knew the Army report was coming out that said raping women,
[1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:30.000]  raping children, Jeffrey Dahmers, raping people with acid.
[1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:33.000]  I can't even say the other stuff on there.
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:36.000]  I mean, it gets worse.
[1:15:36.000 --> 1:15:39.000]  Let me tell you something.
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:42.000]  Torturing children's genitals with pliers is evil.
[1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:45.000]  I don't care what you say, you piece of trash.
[1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:49.000]  All of you, the Attorney General, all of them are the scum of Earth.
[1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:52.000]  General Mukasey won't say that waterboarding is torture.
[1:15:52.000 --> 1:15:57.000]  General, go to when he's threatening me and later I'll talk more about this.
[1:15:57.000 --> 1:16:01.000]  When he's saying how horrible I am and screaming and cussing at me, we edited that part out.
[1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:05.000]  Listen to this, this little self-righteous nobody who knows nothing
[1:16:05.000 --> 1:16:09.000]  and who's aid to these gangsters and thugs that run our government
[1:16:09.000 --> 1:16:16.000]  is helping destroy the name of this country and is dishonoring the police and military's uniforms forever.
[1:16:16.000 --> 1:16:19.000]  You have dishonored me as an American.
[1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:22.000]  You have destroyed my country.
[1:16:22.000 --> 1:16:27.000]  Weak scum like you have destroyed the country that had the greatest name in the world.
[1:16:27.000 --> 1:16:31.000]  We'll never get it back, you piece of filth.
[1:16:31.000 --> 1:16:33.000]  Just play it.
[1:16:33.000 --> 1:16:36.000]  When you're in the business that I am being in politics,
[1:16:36.000 --> 1:16:41.000]  there are some people that you want to talk about, some you don't want to talk about,
[1:16:41.000 --> 1:16:47.000]  and then there are the other days where there are people that you hope you never have to talk about.
[1:16:47.000 --> 1:16:53.000]  And in today's lecture, one of the most disgusting and most despicable human beings alive,
[1:16:53.000 --> 1:16:57.000]  by far, radio talk show host Alex Jones.
[1:16:57.000 --> 1:17:07.000]  He's best known for his conspiracy theorism and way, way far out there views on pretty much everything when it comes to anything.
[1:17:07.000 --> 1:17:16.000]  He's best known for his 9-11 conspiracy theories and those people who believe that 9-11 was a conspiracy to me
[1:17:16.000 --> 1:17:18.000]  are probably the scum of the earth.
[1:17:18.000 --> 1:17:22.000]  They are probably the biggest scum of the earth.
[1:17:22.000 --> 1:17:28.000]  A tapeworm's life is worth more compared to them, in my opinion.
[1:17:28.000 --> 1:17:36.000]  But today I think it's best that we examine Alex Jones who he really is and who his people are.
[1:17:36.000 --> 1:17:46.000]  And one of his best, one of his less known but very confirmed theories is that the Columbine high school shooters,
[1:17:46.000 --> 1:17:51.000]  Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, and more recently the Virginia Tech shooter, Joe Saul Wee,
[1:17:51.000 --> 1:17:55.000]  were all under government mind control.
[1:17:55.000 --> 1:18:00.000]  He truly does believe that those three shooters were under government mind control,
[1:18:00.000 --> 1:18:03.000]  and yet he never gives any reasons why.
[1:18:03.000 --> 1:18:06.000]  Stop right there. We're going to go to Professor Jones after this quick break.
[1:18:06.000 --> 1:18:08.000]  That is totally false.
[1:18:08.000 --> 1:18:11.000]  We have broken down a lot of police and others.
[1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:17.000]  I have gone over the evidence. We've done three, four, five hour programs on Columbine.
[1:18:17.000 --> 1:18:21.000]  And I've said the jury's out, but a lot of evidence points towards it in Blacksburg.
[1:18:21.000 --> 1:18:28.000]  And we have government programs like Operation North was that says staged mass shootings and then blame patsies.
[1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:33.000]  And the Russians have now been caught. It's mainstream news staging the Beslan massacre.
[1:18:33.000 --> 1:18:36.000]  Do I need to explain to you how they stage that in the theater massacre?
[1:18:36.000 --> 1:18:41.000]  Do I need to explain to a little boy like you play the rest of it?
[1:18:41.000 --> 1:18:47.000]  Yet he has his own talk show, his own radio talk show in his hometown of Boston, Texas.
[1:18:47.000 --> 1:18:54.000]  But then one day on 9 11 when all that had to happen, that was his Christmas.
[1:18:54.000 --> 1:18:58.000]  That was his day where he could stay right there.
[1:18:58.000 --> 1:19:02.000]  I was on more radio stations before 9 11 than I am now.
[1:19:02.000 --> 1:19:07.000]  I lost a bunch of my radio stations when I went on air day one and said it was an inside job.
[1:19:07.000 --> 1:19:11.000]  So don't flip it around and say I got my fame off of 9 11.
[1:19:11.000 --> 1:19:15.000]  More lies, more disinfo, more innuendo by a.
[1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:21.000]  I mean, you just look at this guy. He is he is weakness personified weakness trying to act strong.
[1:19:21.000 --> 1:19:29.000]  I'm going to play more of it later. He starts calling me Phil Scum, all this stuff and.
[1:19:29.000 --> 1:19:39.000]  Oh, it's just there's nothing more pathetic than someone trying to act manly and thinking saying torture and secret arrest and our lives don't matter.
[1:19:39.000 --> 1:19:43.000]  You don't know what we've gone through to tell the truth, you little punk.
[1:19:43.000 --> 1:19:50.000]  Shame on you. You cowardly weak chicken neck.
[1:19:50.000 --> 1:19:52.000]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[1:19:52.000 --> 1:19:56.000]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[1:19:56.000 --> 1:19:58.000]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[1:19:58.000 --> 1:20:01.000]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[1:20:01.000 --> 1:20:07.000]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan.
[1:20:07.000 --> 1:20:11.000]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[1:21:05.000 --> 1:21:08.000]  Hedge fund is cut in the malaise of mortgage bankruptcies.
[1:21:08.000 --> 1:21:10.000]  The bond market continues to slump.
[1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:13.000]  Happy Morgan gets caught in a 10 billion bad deal for Chrysler.
[1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:15.000]  Housing sales fell 6.6 percent.
[1:21:15.000 --> 1:21:20.000]  Mortgage giant countrywide showed mortgage payment was spreading to the middle and upper class.
[1:21:20.000 --> 1:21:23.000]  Investors cast out on investment banks.
[1:21:23.000 --> 1:21:27.000]  Credit protection insurance for mortgage lenders is skyrocketing due to the increased risk.
[1:21:27.000 --> 1:21:32.000]  The U.S. dollar is free falling against foreign currencies and countries that previously financed the U.S.
[1:21:32.000 --> 1:21:34.000]  are now seeking safer alternatives.

[1:22:18.000 --> 1:22:23.000]  Elite, proponents of the New World Order. They oppose everything that is God and truth.
[1:22:23.000 --> 1:22:27.000]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago.
[1:22:27.000 --> 1:22:32.000]  Everything they have built over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated, the power they have established,
[1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:36.000]  the poisoning of the masses, the destruction of the earth and mankind,

[1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:21.000]  Well, he is a published physicist, made some of very famous discoveries.
[1:24:21.000 --> 1:24:24.000]  He's seen as a top physicist.
[1:24:24.000 --> 1:24:32.000]  And he saw two buildings turn into powdered dust and metal cut off and blown in little pieces.
[1:24:32.000 --> 1:24:38.000]  And he saw another building fall in a perfect controlled emulation and the countdown by the police and everybody.
[1:24:38.000 --> 1:24:44.000]  And firemen, they were told that the government was going to blow it up and he's gotten samples and tested it.
[1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:49.000]  His theory was it would be thermate that could cut through and have explosive power that fast.
[1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:54.000]  And sure enough, they got samples, multiple samples and that's exactly what it is, the exact signature.
[1:24:54.000 --> 1:25:03.000]  And we know they did it and he's now gotten his information published and peer reviewed prestigious journals, engineers have had it as well.
[1:25:03.000 --> 1:25:09.000]  And NIST keeps saying they can't say why building 7-Fell, they admit they're looking at bombs.
[1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:14.000]  And we are now joined by Professor Stephen Jones.
[1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:16.000]  And thanks for coming on, my friend.
[1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:19.000]  Great to be with you again, Alex.
[1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:28.000]  Pleased to be with you. I just hope my little cell phone in this rural community out here in the six will work fine.
[1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:37.000]  We've moved away from the earthquake zone in Utah and out into a small farming community.
[1:25:37.000 --> 1:25:44.000]  So we're pretty happy to be out here, but my phone service yet is still not the greatest.
[1:25:44.000 --> 1:25:46.000]  I'm just hoping this will last for us.
[1:25:46.000 --> 1:25:52.000]  Well, we're happy to have you out there. You've got the floor. Tell us what you want to talk about in the 35 minutes we've got.
[1:25:52.000 --> 1:26:00.000]  Yeah, let me start with peer reviewed paper. It was peer reviewed by three reviewers and it's 14 points.
[1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:02.000]  Let's see, what's the rest of it?
[1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:08.000]  14 agreements with official government reports on the World Trade Center destruction.
[1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:15.000]  And what we did there, I am an author, a first author you see with four other authors.
[1:26:15.000 --> 1:26:27.000]  You'll know some of these Kevin Ryan, James Gurley, Tony Zambodian, mechanical engineer Frank Legge and Australia PhD chemist.
[1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:36.000]  So what we did is we have, of course, been reading the official government reports on the World Trade Center destruction.
[1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:47.000]  And we found areas where they're basically admitting that they're having trouble with the fire based explanation, fire and damage based explanation.
[1:26:47.000 --> 1:26:55.000]  For example, with World Trade Center seven, and that's the one that caught my attention three years ago.
[1:26:55.000 --> 1:27:03.000]  You know, when I finally woke up when a friend nudged me a couple friends and I thought World Trade Center seven come down.
[1:27:03.000 --> 1:27:09.000]  Anyway, that's our first point in there. You don't even have the NIST report yet.
[1:27:09.000 --> 1:27:13.000]  That's the National Institute of Standards and Technology. It keeps being delayed and promised.
[1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:18.000]  I think it's promised again for this month. If I remember, that was late last year.
[1:27:18.000 --> 1:27:22.000]  It was supposed to be out again and they delayed it till this month, but we'll see.
[1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:27.000]  But of course, they know we're watching with what they come up with.
[1:27:27.000 --> 1:27:37.000]  Anyway, so we go back to the FEMA report on World Trade Center seven and there we read that after FEMA tries to explain the collapse of this skyscraper,
[1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:47.000]  47 stories skyscraper on September 11, then FEMA admits, quote, our best hypothesis has only a low probability of occurrence.
[1:27:47.000 --> 1:27:53.000]  Well, who can disagree with that? You know, this is a fire based hypothesis.
[1:27:53.000 --> 1:28:02.000]  And, you know, we just haven't seen skyscrapers come completely down like that ever before or after.
[1:28:02.000 --> 1:28:08.000]  So they admit that their fire based hypothesis is a weak, a low probability of occurrence.
[1:28:08.000 --> 1:28:10.000]  And so we agree with that.
[1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:18.000]  Another example in the paper is the pancakeing theory, which was promoted by FEMA actually in this case.
[1:28:18.000 --> 1:28:29.000]  This is the pancakeing floors for the destruction and popular mechanics, very famous or infamous, depending on how you look at it, article.
[1:28:29.000 --> 1:28:38.000]  They promoted, of course, the same pancakeing theory as the ANOVA program, the pancakeing floor theory of collapse.
[1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:52.000]  Then we get to NISD and their lengthy analysis of the collapse. They rule out the pancakeing theory and they say this is not correct and they go through.
[1:28:52.000 --> 1:28:58.000]  And, of course, we agree with NIST. This is the final report then on the towers collapse.
[1:28:58.000 --> 1:29:05.000]  And we agree that the pancakeing theory needs to be discarded, thrown out. It's not valid.
[1:29:05.000 --> 1:29:12.000]  And NIST also talks about the fact that the towers fell in essentially free fall.
[1:29:12.000 --> 1:29:18.000]  We agree with that. They don't explain how that can happen, you know?
[1:29:18.000 --> 1:29:24.000]  We do. With controlled demolition, you find essentially free fall for buildings.
[1:29:24.000 --> 1:29:32.000]  But they have trouble with that. But at least we agree on the observation that the buildings came down essentially in free fall.
[1:29:32.000 --> 1:29:41.000]  Professor Jones, stay there back in three quick minutes. Let's walk through your peer review report. It's really upsetting the establishment.
[1:29:41.000 --> 1:29:51.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:29:51.000 --> 1:30:00.000]  Hi, my name is William Lewis. And if you're listening to this radio station, then chances are you've probably seen one or two of the documentaries that I've made over the years.
[1:30:00.000 --> 1:30:05.000]  We've seen one in plain sight, beyond treason, or maybe 9-1-1 ripple effect.
[1:30:05.000 --> 1:30:12.000]  And by now, you've got to be as angry as I am and wondering what else have they done and what are we going to do about it.
[1:30:12.000 --> 1:30:22.000]  My latest documentary, Washington You're Fired, was made to explore these ideas of change while at the same time exposing the scope of the president's immoral and illegal spy program.
[1:30:22.000 --> 1:30:30.000]  We reveal the abuses committed under the Protection of the Patriot Act, Military Commissions Act, and other very intrusive spy bills.
[1:30:30.000 --> 1:30:38.000]  Washington You're Fired explores the removal of habeas corpus, posicumetatus, and the subversion of our entire Bill of Rights.

[1:30:51.000 --> 1:30:55.000]  It is a big idea. A New World Order.
[1:30:55.000 --> 1:31:00.000]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[1:31:00.000 --> 1:31:06.000]  It's known as the Builder Bird. Could their objective be world domination?
[1:31:06.000 --> 1:31:17.000]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[1:31:17.000 --> 1:31:24.000]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[1:31:24.000 --> 1:31:28.000]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[1:31:28.000 --> 1:31:31.000]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[1:31:31.000 --> 1:31:36.000]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power. That's their appellation.

[1:31:45.000 --> 1:31:50.000]  In-game blueprint for global enslaved. You have been warned.
[1:31:50.000 --> 1:31:54.000]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[1:31:54.000 --> 1:31:58.000]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[1:31:58.000 --> 1:32:02.000]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[1:32:02.000 --> 1:32:05.000]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[1:32:05.000 --> 1:32:10.000]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the disease that we see.
[1:32:10.000 --> 1:32:16.000]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like Cardivite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill,
[1:32:16.000 --> 1:32:20.000]  now going for regular jobs a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[1:32:20.000 --> 1:32:27.000]  It's a well-thought-out formula. I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[1:32:27.000 --> 1:32:33.000]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems. It'll work on other problems as well.
[1:32:33.000 --> 1:32:43.000]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[1:32:43.000 --> 1:33:04.000]  That toll free number again, 1-877-928-8822.
[1:33:15.000 --> 1:33:27.000]  I wish that I could fly into the sky, so very high, just like a dragonfly.
[1:33:27.000 --> 1:33:35.000]  I fly above the trees, over the seas, and on the grease, to anywhere I please.
[1:33:35.000 --> 1:33:53.000]  The websites are www.prisonplanet.com, www.infowars.net, www.prisonplanet.tv, www.jonesreport.com, www.thevauntedinfowars.com that's exploded from
[1:33:53.000 --> 1:34:06.000]  number 15,000 on Alexa now to 5,000 in something. Well, that's bigger than WorldNet daily now. It is database-driven. That means it's got all sorts of scripts running in the back.
[1:34:06.000 --> 1:34:14.000]  You can post articles. You can get membership pages for free with your own pages, and it's got postings and articles where you can post comments.
[1:34:14.000 --> 1:34:27.000]  We've got some database error thing going, and we've got people working around the clock on that. Infowars.com is down, but that's why I have all these auxiliary sites that have the same info,
[1:34:27.000 --> 1:34:35.000]  and on every site it will have some of its own unique info each day, truthnews.us as well, so that we have redundancy.
[1:34:35.000 --> 1:34:41.000]  Our main capital ship is out of the fight right now in Drydock. Been down for four hours, but I'm told it'll be up soon.
[1:34:41.000 --> 1:34:47.000]  And that's why we need things like the money bomb we just had that raise a lot of money. I want to thank all of you, and I'm going to talk.

[1:35:07.000 --> 1:35:15.000]  There's some other peer-reviewed reports coming out now, and the so-called debunkers who've been caught lying every step of the way.
[1:35:15.000 --> 1:35:22.000]  I mean, there's one thing they'll do. They'll say just everything they say is a lie or a twist, but they'll say,
[1:35:22.000 --> 1:35:22.000]  Norad never intercepted one aircraft in the year before 9-11 except
[1:35:22.000 --> 1:35:51.000]  intercepted one aircraft.
