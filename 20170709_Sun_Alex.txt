[00:00.000 --> 00:12.280]  Hard to believe it's Sunday, July 9th, 2017.
[00:12.280 --> 00:28.040]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:28.040 --> 00:34.040]  Kim Jong-un warns Donald Trump he is pushing North Korea to the brink of nuclear war.
[00:34.040 --> 00:37.040]  That's the headline for Daily Mail on Infowars.com.
[00:37.040 --> 00:41.720]  We've got Trump's huge success over in Germany, amidst all the communist sorrows funded groups
[00:41.720 --> 00:45.760]  running around and burning down cars and buildings and attacking people.
[00:45.760 --> 00:50.560]  We've got massive CNN caught in more fake news about the Pope flipping out, saying world
[00:50.560 --> 00:54.280]  governments in crisis, saying the US and Russia should not be allies.
[00:54.280 --> 00:55.280]  It's all coming up.
[00:55.280 --> 01:00.440]  But first, a very important report from John Bowne, as the fake media tries to protect
[01:00.440 --> 01:02.440]  voter fraud.
[01:02.440 --> 01:07.360]  White House aid, the fake news complex, is collapsing.
[01:07.360 --> 01:11.800]  Sebastian Corka lays it all out.
[01:11.800 --> 01:15.340]  Trump tweeted, I'm extremely pleased to see that CNN has finally been exposed as fake
[01:15.340 --> 01:17.720]  news and garbage journalism.
[01:17.720 --> 01:18.960]  It's about time.
[01:18.960 --> 01:25.240]  Maybe fake news isn't the right term, but fraud news or criminal news.
[01:25.240 --> 01:28.200]  Trump also says, what are they trying to hide?
[01:28.200 --> 01:33.440]  Trump questioned states refusing to show voter ID information.
[01:33.440 --> 01:34.440]  You know why?
[01:34.440 --> 01:42.200]  Because Harvard this year has already done a study where they sampled 10,000 people randomly
[01:42.200 --> 01:48.320]  from voter rolls, and they found a percentage that if you compared it to the general election
[01:48.320 --> 01:55.640]  and voting rolls, it would be 5.7 million illegals that voted, not to mention people
[01:55.640 --> 01:57.600]  voting in the names of dead people.
[01:57.600 --> 02:02.880]  It's a well-known Democratic Party operation for 100 years or more.
[02:02.880 --> 02:08.440]  To keep the newspapers, to see who's died, to then go check the voter roll and then give
[02:08.440 --> 02:13.960]  those names, normally about 10 people, 10 dead people, are given to each person that
[02:13.960 --> 02:17.880]  votes illegally, and they go around the different precincts, and that's what they do.
[02:17.880 --> 02:19.720]  The average is 10 times.
[02:19.720 --> 02:25.360]  We have Democrats on video in New York and D.C. and other areas, top-level Democrats saying
[02:25.360 --> 02:27.880]  we're organizing the biggest fraud ever, f-Trump.
[02:27.880 --> 02:30.880]  Oh, like minority neighborhoods, like Black neighborhoods and Hispanic neighborhoods?
[02:30.880 --> 02:31.880]  Chinese, too.
[02:31.880 --> 02:32.880]  Oh.
[02:32.880 --> 02:33.880]  Why do they do that?
[02:33.880 --> 02:34.880]  Just to get more votes for Democrats?
[02:34.880 --> 02:35.880]  They're all running for office.
[02:35.880 --> 02:36.880]  Oh, yeah, for their candidates.
[02:36.880 --> 02:52.480]  They get buses, they move people around.
[02:52.480 --> 02:54.480]  And they almost stole the election.
[02:54.480 --> 02:58.680]  Five states were stolen, they almost stole six others, Homeland Security under Obama
[02:58.680 --> 03:03.160]  was trying to break into the computers, but the state officials stopped it.
[03:03.160 --> 03:08.440]  Trump's answer was to say, I signed executive order federalizing the elections.
[03:08.440 --> 03:13.520]  And now Trump is trying to defederalize it, but all he said was, hey, states, share with
[03:13.520 --> 03:19.840]  me the voter ID rolls, and then we want to index this just with people that are dead
[03:19.840 --> 03:23.400]  and people that aren't citizens, we can run it right through the computer, and they said
[03:23.400 --> 03:24.400]  no way.
[03:24.400 --> 03:30.960]  20 states that are still Democrat-controlled, all of them Democrat, said no way, Jose.
[03:30.960 --> 03:36.520]  Now, I thought no illegals voted, I thought no dead people voted.
[03:36.520 --> 03:40.480]  And now more and more is coming out, even the Associated Press of Homeland Security
[03:40.480 --> 03:42.800]  trying to break into the computers on election night.
[03:42.800 --> 03:48.920]  I mean, what do you think is going on when CNN was sampling 36 points in some of their
[03:48.920 --> 03:50.880]  polls against Trump?
[03:50.880 --> 03:56.520]  They were adding 36 percentage points in and admitting it in their methodology.
[03:56.520 --> 04:01.640]  Of course, Hillary was winning by 67 percent when you add 30-something percent more on
[04:01.640 --> 04:07.760]  top of it, because the real polls, the internal polls, the scientific polls, the big Google
[04:07.760 --> 04:12.920]  data polls, some of which were in the news, others of which I talked to high-level executives
[04:12.920 --> 04:19.160]  and high-level people in Congress and high-level folks in the CIA, Trump was 20 points ahead
[04:19.160 --> 04:21.920]  when he came out of that Republican convention.
[04:21.920 --> 04:29.160]  On election day, in an index of internal polls, he was 14 points ahead of Hillary, 14 points.
[04:29.160 --> 04:32.200]  Remember, I told you all this during the election.
[04:32.200 --> 04:37.240]  They have thousands of articles lying, Alex Jones says Trump's really 15 points ahead,
[04:37.240 --> 04:38.400]  20 points ahead.
[04:38.400 --> 04:40.920]  But what happened on election day?
[04:40.920 --> 04:46.480]  He had such a mega-landslide that despite all the fraud and everything he threw, he
[04:46.480 --> 04:51.680]  still won by the electoral college.
[04:51.680 --> 04:53.760]  And that's why I root for Trump so much.
[04:53.760 --> 04:55.320]  He is totally for real.
[04:55.320 --> 04:56.640]  They're absolutely out to get him.
[04:56.640 --> 04:57.640]  This is history.
[04:57.640 --> 05:01.640]  We're all witnessing.
[05:01.640 --> 05:05.200]  MycoZX is back in after five plus months sold out.
[05:05.200 --> 05:06.840]  Talk about next-level probiotic.
[05:06.840 --> 05:11.000]  It's the anti-fungus, anti-yeast, latest technology of 4.8 stars.
[05:11.000 --> 05:14.360]  It's been sold out for months, big waiting list, limited amount, because it's so hard
[05:14.360 --> 05:17.120]  to get the compounds and have it be California standards.
[05:17.120 --> 05:18.120]  Nobody's got something that's good.
[05:18.120 --> 05:22.480]  You get 30% off of MycoZX and get the gut health support back when you get it with the
[05:22.480 --> 05:25.720]  biome defense, 50 billion live in each pill, probiotic.
[05:25.720 --> 05:29.440]  MycoZX contains seven of the world's most powerful organic and well-crafted ingredients
[05:29.440 --> 05:33.160]  designed to attack and melt away the membrane of yeast and fungal organisms.
[05:33.160 --> 05:38.000]  Start fighting back against hidden yeast and fungus with MycoZX, enforcelife.com, before
[05:38.000 --> 05:41.240]  it sells out again, 10% off when you choose auto-ship.
[05:41.240 --> 05:45.080]  It's kind of embarrassing to get family and crew members on that have terrible bowel and
[05:45.080 --> 05:48.280]  crones type stuff that didn't exist 50 years ago, now it's epidemic, but I'm getting ready
[05:48.280 --> 05:50.960]  to have a bunch of folks go ahead and come on here and tell you what it did for them,
[05:50.960 --> 05:55.960]  because regardless you can't lose your fun in the operation, infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com
[05:55.960 --> 06:21.960]  or triple-A2533139.
[06:21.960 --> 06:29.440]  I am very, very proud of the fact that I've never worked for any government agency, never
[06:29.440 --> 06:34.480]  worked for a think tank, never worked for a large corporation.
[06:34.480 --> 06:41.320]  I have engineered infowars in the last 22 years simply by trying to tell the truth, doing
[06:41.320 --> 06:47.360]  research and working with the audience, and we now reach conservatively more than 45 million
[06:47.360 --> 06:50.400]  people a week that either tune in or watch the show.
[06:50.400 --> 06:55.320]  That's not counting readers and other folks that might just get partial pieces of what
[06:55.320 --> 07:02.720]  we're doing, but actual people tuning in to this radio slash TV transmission 45 million
[07:02.720 --> 07:05.840]  a week conservatively one way or another.
[07:05.840 --> 07:12.680]  And there are now scores of other independent journalists out there, like Mike Cernovich
[07:12.680 --> 07:20.880]  and Paul Joseph Watson and Gavin McGinnis and others that individually are conservatively
[07:20.880 --> 07:26.200]  reaching 15 million people a week each.
[07:26.200 --> 07:30.920]  Just yesterday I went and counted up on Watson's four or five channels, how many views he's
[07:30.920 --> 07:34.960]  had in the week, he's been partially on vacation this week, 16 million views.
[07:34.960 --> 07:42.040]  I went and counted up Cernovich's views and it was over 11 million, that was on Saturday.
[07:42.040 --> 07:46.960]  I went and looked at what McGinnis was up to and it was in the tens of millions.
[07:46.960 --> 07:50.560]  And that's just, again, if you look at a few of the channels, you have to add it all together
[07:50.560 --> 07:51.560]  in the aggregate.
[07:51.560 --> 07:55.280]  You have to go look at Watson's Facebook that has about five times the views of just
[07:55.280 --> 08:00.320]  one of his YouTube channels and I don't say that up front to brag.
[08:00.320 --> 08:06.040]  I say it so the listeners understand we are the largest minority.
[08:06.040 --> 08:08.280]  The world is Balkanized.
[08:08.280 --> 08:17.240]  The world is lots of different niche groups, over 10,000 denominations of Protestantism.
[08:17.240 --> 08:22.320]  You've got hundreds of sects of Islam, 80% of it's Sunni.
[08:22.320 --> 08:26.520]  You've got all the different liberal splinter groups, you've got all the different 50 plus
[08:26.520 --> 08:29.920]  sexual persuasions.
[08:29.920 --> 08:36.440]  The world is Balkanized, it's atomized by country, by population and in a way that's
[08:36.440 --> 08:40.560]  our strength because one tyranny or one system can't take over.
[08:40.560 --> 08:45.280]  It's true diversity, it's true richness.
[08:45.280 --> 08:52.880]  But if you pull back, CNN's average show has about 100,000 viewers, their top shows have
[08:52.880 --> 09:01.400]  about 500 to 600,000 and it's dropping and dropping and dropping and dropping.
[09:01.400 --> 09:10.760]  But getting back to the first thing I said, it's an illusion that mainstream media is
[09:10.760 --> 09:12.760]  even on its last legs.
[09:12.760 --> 09:15.280]  It knows that it's collapsed.
[09:15.280 --> 09:18.680]  It knows it's already totally compromised and totally discredited.
[09:18.680 --> 09:25.720]  It knows it's universally reviled except by a very small group of mindless trendies who
[09:25.720 --> 09:29.640]  are complete losers and followers and don't know how to tie their shoelaces or wipe their
[09:29.640 --> 09:32.880]  hind ends without help, literally.
[09:32.880 --> 09:37.680]  I don't say that with pleasure, it's very sad how stupid they are.
[09:37.680 --> 09:45.680]  But the reason I make the point that I'm very proud of the fact that we organically grew
[09:45.680 --> 09:50.680]  and never had big corporate funding, never had establishment support because that's
[09:50.680 --> 10:00.200]  really the brass ring everybody's looking for, especially in the year 2017, now more
[10:00.200 --> 10:07.880]  than halfway into the year on this Sunday, the ninth day of July 2017.
[10:07.880 --> 10:18.920]  Now that said, the reason I raise that point is that because we are organic, we're honest.
[10:18.920 --> 10:22.080]  Take the term information war, info war.
[10:22.080 --> 10:26.640]  That's now what Hillary uses, it's what the Pentagon uses, it's what is discussed all
[10:26.640 --> 10:31.680]  over the media for the last few years, it's been the big buzzword.
[10:31.680 --> 10:33.640]  And why is it the big buzzword?
[10:33.640 --> 10:37.160]  Because they've been engaged, the criminal interest that have hijacked our country and
[10:37.160 --> 10:41.320]  much of the world in information warfare against us.
[10:41.320 --> 10:45.400]  And so when I was studying what they'd done to us, the operations they were carrying out
[10:45.400 --> 10:51.120]  against us and talking to people who'd been in Air Force Intelligence and the CIA and
[10:51.120 --> 10:55.560]  the FBI, old retirees that were going down to city council meetings and stuff and fighting
[10:55.560 --> 11:01.280]  globalism, fighting uncontrolled, they told me, son, you're engaged in information warfare
[11:01.280 --> 11:05.440]  against the enemy, call it that.
[11:05.440 --> 11:12.160]  So I've never been in an intelligence agency, but basically what we've done with info wars
[11:12.160 --> 11:21.160]  is bring back what America was with a 2.0 spin on it to resist the globalist.
[11:21.160 --> 11:28.760]  And now, I can chronicle where we've been first on almost every major story because
[11:28.760 --> 11:33.520]  we are actually doing the real research and not even following what mainstream media puts
[11:33.520 --> 11:36.440]  out or their talking points.
[11:36.440 --> 11:39.800]  They're designed to keep people in the dark and to put people in false paradigms.
[11:39.800 --> 11:46.600]  We're really tracking how governments run, how corporations run, how systems operate.
[11:46.600 --> 11:52.640]  And that's why info wars is the number one broadcast listened to at the Pentagon in intelligence
[11:52.640 --> 11:57.800]  agencies and in foreign governments because they know why we're demonized and MSM.
[11:57.800 --> 11:59.800]  They know why we're attacked.
[11:59.800 --> 12:09.320]  It's because we're over the target and we've provided the decompartmentalization into the
[12:09.320 --> 12:13.680]  public sphere, but also behind the curtain of government control that has allowed the
[12:13.680 --> 12:20.240]  internal debates to be triggered to now lead us to the point we are today.
[12:20.240 --> 12:22.160]  That's why the MSM hates info wars.
[12:22.160 --> 12:23.160]  It's why they demonize us.
[12:23.160 --> 12:29.520]  It's why they attack us because they know that you did get Trump elected.
[12:29.520 --> 12:31.880]  Alex Jones didn't get Trump elected.
[12:31.880 --> 12:34.000]  Info wars doesn't get the credit.
[12:34.000 --> 12:40.240]  To the audience that are informed and involved in symbiotically giving us info, you give
[12:40.240 --> 12:42.640]  us info, we give you info.
[12:42.640 --> 12:45.720]  We are the rebirth of Americana.
[12:45.720 --> 12:48.440]  We are the true melting pot.
[12:48.440 --> 12:50.040]  We are the true diversity.
[12:50.040 --> 12:51.540]  We are the true empowerment.
[12:51.540 --> 12:59.280]  We are the true renaissance that made America the apple of the world's eye.
[12:59.280 --> 13:02.920]  Not because we were perfect, but we were the best that had yet been achieved.
[13:02.920 --> 13:08.520]  And the globalists, the royalty, the robber barons, the monopoly men, they couldn't compete
[13:08.520 --> 13:12.640]  with that, so they've been trying to take it over and use that engine of success to
[13:12.640 --> 13:16.880]  dominate the globe while blaming free market for the crimes they've committed.
[13:16.880 --> 13:22.040]  But all of that is now being reversed, not in some overnight success story as it appears
[13:22.040 --> 13:28.800]  to be, but through long laborious labor and action against the dominant corporate media
[13:28.800 --> 13:34.400]  60, 70 years ago, but they're not dominant anymore, are they?
[13:34.400 --> 13:40.960]  And so understand we are living in a magical, amazing, very positive time, but also extremely
[13:40.960 --> 13:45.640]  dangerous because the enemy is very, very scared and very, very desperate.
[13:45.640 --> 13:48.040]  Let me give you an example.
[13:48.040 --> 13:53.740]  Five years ago, we had Tosh Plumling, admitted CIA contractor, famous operative.
[13:53.740 --> 13:57.780]  We had Colonel Tony Schaefer on.
[13:57.780 --> 13:59.880]  We had a bunch of other guests on.
[13:59.880 --> 14:04.040]  And then three years later, Sye Hirsch came on the show and said, good job, you're reporting.
[14:04.040 --> 14:05.400]  It's been dead on.
[14:05.400 --> 14:12.360]  Here's the evidence that our military, now five and a half years ago, said no, Obama.
[14:12.360 --> 14:14.560]  We're not going to back Al Qaeda taking over Syria.
[14:14.560 --> 14:16.960]  We're not going to back the Arab Spring anymore.
[14:16.960 --> 14:21.160]  This is a setup with big foundations to turn radical Muslims loose and overthrow secular
[14:21.160 --> 14:27.120]  governments and kill Christians and non-radical Muslims and our own military told Obama no.
[14:27.120 --> 14:33.160]  And for five years, there's been a stalemate where our military worked with Russia to take
[14:33.160 --> 14:34.160]  out the Al Qaeda.
[14:34.160 --> 14:37.200]  Now ISIS threat, it's almost gone.
[14:37.200 --> 14:39.600]  Only a few pockets left.
[14:39.600 --> 14:45.680]  And I told you then a deal had been made with Assad to step down and have elections once
[14:45.680 --> 14:49.240]  we forced Al Qaeda and ISIS out.
[14:49.240 --> 14:52.800]  Now we are about to reach that point and you saw Rex Tillerson on Friday in his press
[14:52.800 --> 14:57.400]  conference say agreements had been made.
[14:57.400 --> 15:02.080]  He didn't allude to the specifics, but that Assad would then prepare for elections and
[15:02.080 --> 15:07.720]  to leave next and that they'd had those meetings with Russia and that Russia agree we needed
[15:07.720 --> 15:10.160]  ceasefires and to move towards that.
[15:10.160 --> 15:18.040]  I told you five years ago, super secret classified information that I was allowed to give you.
[15:18.040 --> 15:22.360]  I'm not under intelligence agencies control.
[15:22.360 --> 15:23.520]  People know I'm Americana.
[15:23.520 --> 15:24.520]  I tell the truth.
[15:24.520 --> 15:25.520]  I really love the country.
[15:25.520 --> 15:29.680]  I really am fighting for prosperity and freedom and security and good decisions.

[20:46.480 --> 20:52.120]  on the scene, many of which have already been laboring in obscurity for years and just exploding
[20:52.120 --> 20:58.760]  in popularity with the general public because that means our culture war of Americana, a
[20:58.760 --> 21:04.440]  free market of common sense is returning and it shows in the marketplace of ideas we're
[21:04.440 --> 21:05.840]  really winning.
[21:05.840 --> 21:10.000]  Mike Cernovich will be joining us for 30 minutes at the start of the next hour.
[21:10.000 --> 21:15.160]  The Council on Foreign Relations is writing big articles against him, basically calling
[21:15.160 --> 21:16.600]  for him to be shut down.
[21:16.600 --> 21:23.680]  Leo Zagami, another investigative journalist of over 15 years' work, who first exposed
[21:23.680 --> 21:29.400]  the gay orgies at the Vatican bust days and days before mainstream media picked it up.
[21:29.400 --> 21:36.240]  He also exposed the fact that the Pope's right-hand man was a procure of young boys for sex slavery.
[21:36.240 --> 21:39.880]  He said that on my broadcast five years ago and again last year.
[21:39.880 --> 21:46.400]  Well, Leo Zagami from Rome will be joining us in the last 30 minutes of the next hour.
[21:46.400 --> 21:50.760]  So the second hour is going to be jam-packed today because of that we're not taking any
[21:50.760 --> 21:54.280]  calls but I will be taking a lot of calls like I did last week.
[21:54.280 --> 22:00.760]  This week 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. with the weekday four-hour transmission and again next month
[22:00.760 --> 22:04.000]  we're going to launch David Knight in the morning for three hours that'll be announced
[22:04.000 --> 22:08.000]  the next week or so the name of the show and more details then we're going to be launching
[22:08.000 --> 22:14.920]  broadcasts with Mike Cernovich, Roger Stone and many many others we've got so many people
[22:14.920 --> 22:20.920]  wanting to join and wanting to launch radio shows slash TV that I have got my hands full
[22:20.920 --> 22:25.280]  I'm not complaining but we are right now trying to hire extra crew get more people
[22:25.280 --> 22:31.560]  trained we are certainly expanding our infrastructure so thank you all for your hopes your prayers
[22:31.560 --> 22:36.960]  and your financial support at infowarstore.com because this is the house that you built okay
[22:36.960 --> 22:47.280]  let me break down the news that's coming up we've never been closer to war with North
[22:47.280 --> 22:53.640]  Korea it could trigger a worldwide thermal nuclear war but even liberal publications
[22:53.640 --> 23:00.840]  admit Trump doesn't have many choices left will explain why coming up we also have the
[23:00.840 --> 23:08.840]  media demonizing President Trump saying he was Dr. Noe at the G20 just like Ron Paul
[23:08.840 --> 23:14.040]  he should know as Dr. Noe because he won't go along with the carbon taxes he won't go
[23:14.040 --> 23:19.960]  along with the open borders to the Middle East he won't go along with all the rest of garbage
[23:19.960 --> 23:25.320]  they're pushing and he won't go along with the G20 trying to vote to have the US pay
[23:25.320 --> 23:32.160]  more dues to NATO and the UN so yes the old days of everybody deciding to dictate what
[23:32.160 --> 23:37.320]  the US is going to do are over Trump is negotiating a lot of good deals with China and Mexico
[23:37.320 --> 23:47.600]  and others but they're reciprocal they're reciprocal like Sergeant Hartman says in
[23:47.600 --> 23:51.720]  full metal jacket I bet you're the type of guy that would do you know what does somebody
[23:51.720 --> 23:56.040]  and not even have the common decency to give him a reach around I don't mean to be gross
[23:56.040 --> 24:01.440]  here but that's kind of what's going on here is America has been completely sold out our
[24:01.440 --> 24:07.000]  infrastructure is falling apart we buy bobbles from China they build giant roads and dams
[24:07.000 --> 24:13.400]  while we destroy our dams we sent Trump to the White House to not sell a sound to not
[24:13.400 --> 24:19.520]  be a globalist and now Trump's nationalist our triumphant after Europe trip he's done
[24:19.520 --> 24:25.880]  two Europe trips and done exactly what he said he would do that is all coming up as
[24:25.880 --> 24:33.880]  well we saw massive rioting and looting in Hamburg after the meeting and we saw the mayor
[24:33.880 --> 24:41.560]  of New York disgustingly going there and helping captain the rioters that were hitting citizens
[24:41.560 --> 24:46.000]  in the back of the head and burning cars and looting buildings and robbing family owned
[24:46.000 --> 24:53.680]  grocery stores so truly truly disgusting activity going on there we're going to be getting to
[24:53.680 --> 25:01.080]  all of those videos many of which I've retweeted at real Alex Jones we've also got some really
[25:01.080 --> 25:07.320]  good news Nancy Pelosi has basically won her leadership battle so far to remain the leader
[25:07.320 --> 25:11.520]  of the Democratic Party in the House Chuck Schumer is still the leader in the Senate
[25:11.520 --> 25:17.920]  these are horrible disconnected corrupt filthy anti-American elites that everyone hates
[25:17.920 --> 25:22.920]  including Democrat constituents but their arrogance ensures the Democratic Party will
[25:22.920 --> 25:28.920]  continue its horrible nose dive while we the people deal with the number one threat and
[25:28.920 --> 25:35.320]  that is the Republican blue blood evil establishment Paul Ryan and others so that is huge news
[25:35.320 --> 25:43.920]  and adding luscious cherry on top ladies and gentlemen nothing in post Breitbart Associated

[27:11.320 --> 27:17.120]  a pack aimed at supporting Democrat candidates in the next year's election let's hope she's
[27:17.120 --> 27:21.360]  just not running a pack to swindle a bunch of Democrats and keep the money like she normally
[27:21.360 --> 27:26.440]  does let's hope she's actually planning on captaining and honchoing and being the head

[33:56.920 --> 34:02.240]  he is pushing north korea to the brink of nuclear war this statement came after he said the
[34:02.240 --> 34:09.680]  day before that the icbm that they fired successfully was a test package for a gift they want to
[34:09.680 --> 34:15.440]  give the united states which is mass death and total destruction they're also quote
[34:15.440 --> 34:21.360]  threatening to quote kill everyone in south korea and kill everyone in japan and japan

[34:28.200 --> 34:33.000]  perfect dictator third-generational never worked today in his life totally delusional
[34:33.000 --> 34:38.720]  can hardly walk he's so degenerate and so lazy he's got a bunch of sycophantic psychos
[34:38.720 --> 34:42.200]  worshiping him and that's the problem i've talked to the experts that have been inside
[34:42.200 --> 34:47.560]  north korea the journalist experts from the white house a wide range of people and they
[34:47.560 --> 34:55.040]  say kim jung an his father kim jung il was partially under chinese control under kim
[34:55.040 --> 35:02.220]  jung an it's way worse china has no control last week he threatened to attack china if
[35:02.220 --> 35:08.280]  they didn't stop sanctions against him so he is completely delusional completely out
[35:08.280 --> 35:16.880]  of his mind he's killed most of his own family including his brother and it's just the classical
[35:16.880 --> 35:23.640]  caligula spoiled brat in power mode and he's got nuclear weapons thanks to bill clinton
[35:23.640 --> 35:28.680]  that's even in mainstream news you can thank bill clinton and hillary for transferring the
[35:28.680 --> 35:35.920]  missile secrets and the official material via the reactors and the physical material
[35:35.920 --> 35:42.040]  to north korea so a lot of the media is trying to blame trump for this this has been brewing
[35:42.040 --> 35:49.520]  for years there has been a ceasefire since the war went to a ceasefire way back at the
[35:49.520 --> 36:00.000]  end of the korean war in july of 1953 it lasted three years it killed 373 thousand in south
[36:00.000 --> 36:09.840]  korea 229 thousand wounded 387 thousand abducted or missing by the north multi generations living

[36:22.280 --> 36:32.640]  178 thousand 32 thousand missing amazing just just think about the magnitude of this and
[36:32.640 --> 36:42.400]  since the dmz was set up in 1953 there's been some shelling and some bombing on both sides
[36:42.400 --> 36:46.720]  in the north is routinely grabbing fishing boats and us vessels and japanese vessels
[36:46.720 --> 36:54.640]  and taking people to force labor camps i mean it's what they do and now the country is unraveling
[36:54.640 --> 36:59.240]  it's falling apart china's put big sanctions on it russia has threatened military action
[36:59.240 --> 37:07.320]  russia shares a small border with it as well and the isolated delusional megalomaniac is
[37:07.320 --> 37:13.400]  now threatening to nuke everyone testing missiles and then wonders why we're doing joint drills
[37:13.400 --> 37:18.880]  which we've always done with the south koreans and his answer is telling president trump
[37:18.880 --> 37:24.600]  don't play with fire on a powder keg close quote we have nuclear weapons and we'll use
[37:24.600 --> 37:31.160]  them can read the daily mail quotes and a statement to trump up on info wars dot com

[38:08.000 --> 38:15.200]  a month ago said oh we're three and leaders of smart cookie maybe he'll work with us and
[38:15.200 --> 38:19.520]  stop firing these missiles maybe we get the sanctions off maybe he'll give up his nuclear
[38:19.520 --> 38:24.320]  program their response was to start shooting more missiles off and threatening to use artillery
[38:24.320 --> 38:31.800]  on south korea's capital city of what eight million people sold so he's got the gun aimed
[38:31.800 --> 38:36.200]  at the world he's threatening everybody and as his weapons get more advanced as his missiles

[47:41.720 --> 47:47.560]  on the vine could drop anytime and we're gonna have to be resolute if north korea
[47:47.560 --> 47:50.600]  starts loading a nuclear weapon on top of those missiles or keeps threatening to nuke
[47:50.600 --> 47:56.160]  everybody but it shows the projection of a mentally ill psychopathic narcissist like
[47:56.160 --> 48:01.840]  kim jong-un that he's the one threatening to vaporize the u.s annihilate japan completely
[48:01.840 --> 48:07.280]  destroy south korea he's already enslaved and starved millions of his own people that
[48:07.280 --> 48:12.840]  he's making all these threats and then wondering why us forces and chinese forces and russian
[48:12.840 --> 48:18.880]  forces are all massing on his borders because you're getting ready to get taken out bro i've
[48:18.880 --> 48:23.600]  talked to people that sent com i've talked to people that special forces special operations
[48:23.600 --> 48:29.200]  command all of it the word is that the finger is on the trigger on north korea because kim
[48:29.200 --> 48:33.920]  jong-un is waving a gun around in a crowded theater aiming at it people saying i'll kill
[48:33.920 --> 48:38.600]  you i'll shoot you like guys that pull a gun on cops and then the cops shoot them and they
[48:38.600 --> 48:46.120]  go like the cops killed him but then they admit the guy pulls a gun but it's beyond
[48:46.120 --> 48:51.240]  pulling a gun he's pulled it he's shooting it off in the air saying i'll kill you what
[48:51.240 --> 48:57.160]  are we supposed to do now i've talked a lot about this just like we told you that there
[48:57.160 --> 49:03.880]  was a big gay sex orgy uh at the main office of the inquisition that's the internal uh

[49:14.800 --> 49:20.880]  told you from all our sources that trump didn't meet with any russians until he was president
[49:20.880 --> 49:25.640]  elect which is totally normal and we told you trump was meeting with the russians to
[49:25.640 --> 49:30.080]  get dirt on hillary and the 30 plus million dollars that her and pedestria got for the
[49:30.080 --> 49:37.520]  uranium everything hillary did they blame trump with as you now see well the new york

[49:44.720 --> 49:50.280]  new york times you can go back to our articles where we explained that's why they met and
[49:50.280 --> 49:54.320]  that's why the democrats are so scared as trump gets into office fully now six and a half
[49:54.320 --> 49:58.320]  months in as he gets his people in place it's his just department in place they've been
[49:58.320 --> 50:01.760]  fighting to keep that happening it's taking trump the longest of any president because
[50:01.760 --> 50:07.360]  they've been blocking him because they know now the media is trying to spin it oh see

[50:28.300 --> 50:35.360]  trump never ordered him to stop the investigation their whole thing is falling apart and they're
[50:35.360 --> 50:41.000]  panicking and they don't know what to do so they're trying to spin it oh look drudge
[50:41.000 --> 50:46.600]  asked the question was donald jr set up though because we know the russians have been playing

[51:10.200 --> 51:15.240]  russian lawyer during the 2016 campaign according to three advisors with a white house brief
[51:15.240 --> 51:19.600]  of a meeting and two others who acknowledged it the meeting was attended by the campaign
[51:19.600 --> 51:25.440]  chairman paul j maniforte the son in law jerry cusner mr. maniforte and mr. cusner only recently
[51:25.440 --> 51:30.260]  disclosed the meeting uh no roger stone talked about it here three months ago though not
[51:30.260 --> 51:35.380]  in content in confidential government documents describe the new york times the times reports
[51:35.380 --> 51:39.940]  the existence of a meeting on saturday but his subsequent interviews the interviews and
[51:39.940 --> 51:45.380]  others revealed the motivation behind it the meeting at trump tower on june 9 2016 two
[51:45.380 --> 51:50.680]  weeks after donald j trump clenched the republican nomination and then you have trump and his
[51:50.680 --> 51:56.940]  people later after he is president elect also meeting wanting more of the dirt so this
[51:56.940 --> 52:00.320]  is how they're trying to spend a meeting after he got the nomination and after his
[52:00.320 --> 52:04.600]  president elect as if he was trying to get them to manipulate the election with hacking
[52:04.600 --> 52:11.600]  in computers or getting into machines all that's a fraud when when you hear them say
[52:11.600 --> 52:17.560]  the russians hacked the election you read the cia report from this year it never says
[52:17.560 --> 52:25.840]  any electronic hacking it says rt had anti hillary stories so again that's their spin
[52:25.840 --> 52:33.440]  trump's son met with a russian lawyer after being promised damaging information on clinton
[52:33.440 --> 52:37.360]  now this is breaking we really should get roger stone on about it see if we can pop in sometime
[52:37.360 --> 52:44.160]  the next hour those other guest are with us okay let's continue now again i already mentioned
[52:44.160 --> 52:49.520]  this good news but i'm gonna mention it one more time hillary clinton's looking at leading
[52:49.520 --> 52:55.840]  the democratic party along with nancy polosi and that whole gimmick where they claim it's
[52:55.840 --> 53:05.080]  about empowering women total total chicane re total dog and pony show the hill is reporting
[53:05.080 --> 53:12.640]  on others that the democrats say hillary will be the face of the 2018 bid of the democrats
[53:12.640 --> 53:19.680]  to try to retake congress good luck with that the problem is they do have election fraud
[53:19.680 --> 53:26.240]  and that's why alaska is now the only state to submit the voter data to the trump election
[53:26.240 --> 53:32.360]  panel that they have requested to simply be able to run the names versus names of illegals
[53:32.360 --> 53:37.720]  and people that are known to be dead they've already gotten 10 000 names from last election
[53:37.720 --> 53:43.120]  from harvard and running that statistical analysis and comparing it to other data rolls it shows
[53:43.120 --> 53:50.960]  evidence of 5.7 million people who were illegal or dead who had their names used to vote that's
[53:50.960 --> 53:58.560]  harvard two weeks ago they've already covered that at nauseam but it is simply incredible
[53:58.560 --> 54:09.920]  now let me get to the pope this pope is a jesuit a leftist a globalist who's firing all the
[54:09.920 --> 54:15.800]  conservative traditionalist the catholic church at the top is unrecognizable from what its
[54:15.800 --> 54:25.440]  basic canons are in the bible it's simply put incredible you can type in search it yourself
[54:25.440 --> 54:32.040]  pope frances says talk of europe's christian roots makes him nauseous let in muslims we
[54:32.040 --> 54:37.440]  all worship the same god merge with islam islam isn't compatible with christianity it never
[54:37.440 --> 54:44.280]  lets christians operate in their countries unless it's small enclaves in syria or iran
[54:44.280 --> 54:50.440]  and our government's trying to overthrow those at least under obama it was so pope frances
[54:50.440 --> 54:55.120]  decries very dangerous alliance between us and russia no that's right see and i've told
[54:55.120 --> 54:59.880]  you what's the new alliance the u.s. and russia christian countries for free market against
[54:59.880 --> 55:07.680]  communist china the e you the saudi arabian islamist and the pope that's the global axis
[55:07.680 --> 55:13.360]  of evil collectivist combine that wants carbon taxes global government it's allied with hollywood
[55:13.360 --> 55:18.880]  the big banks that's the big dominant force against russia that said no to going under
[55:18.880 --> 55:23.280]  globalism and teaching five-year-olds how to be trannies and everything else and and
[55:23.280 --> 55:28.720]  you know exterminating the rest of the population with birth control russia is now more classically
[55:28.720 --> 55:32.480]  christian than the catholic church has thought about the last hundred years it's orthodox
[55:32.480 --> 55:39.120]  of course america is trying to come back with basic free market basic non self destructiveness
[55:39.120 --> 55:44.240]  and the pope is panicking the pope is freaked out and so the same pope the same e you the
[55:44.240 --> 55:50.720]  same saudi arabia all the same globalist interest are piled on trying to bring down
[55:50.720 --> 55:54.480]  the american recovery trump went right to saudi arabia and said you cut it out we're
[55:54.480 --> 55:59.120]  going to take you out they've backed off so the globalist alliance is starting to fall
[55:59.120 --> 56:04.240]  apart and the mainstream media is falling apart so their globalist alliance is on the
[56:04.240 --> 56:10.080]  skids it's going over the edge it's like a train over the side of a bridge this is an
[56:10.080 --> 56:19.040]  amazing time to be alive and then you've got the pope allied with radical islam orthodox islam
[56:19.040 --> 56:25.680]  and linda sarsour given hundreds of millions of dollars by soros to lead feminism in america
[56:25.680 --> 56:32.400]  with a hajib on her face supporting sexual mutilation supporting jihad speaking at hamas last week
[56:33.600 --> 56:37.520]  she said when we stand up against trump we stand up against those who oppress our communities
[56:37.520 --> 56:43.840]  a la accepts that as a form of jihad or holy war deport her there's a big movement for this
[56:43.840 --> 56:51.200]  let's play a clip and i hope that we when we stand up to those who oppress our communities
[56:51.200 --> 56:57.520]  that a la accepts from us that as a form of jihad that we are struggling against tyrants and rulers

[1:00:53.120 --> 1:01:03.360]  cages like linda sarsour wearing her hijab to run around and be made the face of feminism
[1:01:03.920 --> 1:01:10.240]  in america because it's anti-west anti-american just like the atlantic monthly said last week
[1:01:10.240 --> 1:01:13.840]  because it'll help set the sun on white america and christianity
[1:01:13.840 --> 1:01:18.640]  it's embraced but you don't see the maniac mentally ill leftist going to the middle east

[1:01:49.520 --> 1:01:55.360]  as a form of jihad that we are struggling against tyrants and rulers not only abroad in the middle

[1:08:19.840 --> 1:08:24.960]  all the fact that trump has green-lighted and other western intelligence agencies are going after him
[1:08:24.960 --> 1:08:30.960]  so we'll cover that we'll cover linda sarsour democratic party uh palestinian leader funded by
[1:08:30.960 --> 1:08:37.680]  soros the democrats saying jihad do not assimilate you'll make us submit to islam basically i know
[1:08:37.680 --> 1:08:41.120]  sardin which has been calling for her to be deported absolutely she's not an american
[1:08:41.120 --> 1:08:46.240]  she wants sharia law let her go back to her lovely middle east let her go back where she
[1:08:46.240 --> 1:08:50.320]  has to wear a full hood over her head and where women can't go to college but she supports the
[1:08:50.320 --> 1:08:55.360]  arab spring yes let's invade and take over non-radical countries that let women go to college where
[1:08:55.360 --> 1:08:59.360]  they don't have to wear beekeeper suits but the first reason mike sardivus shines this is
[1:09:00.320 --> 1:09:05.840]  there have been globalist washington post hit pieces out on us in talking points misrepresenting
[1:09:05.840 --> 1:09:11.360]  everything i say everything i do lying about me i never said there were kids on mars and mars basis
[1:09:11.360 --> 1:09:17.440]  never said it total lie uh saying that i said that uh i've talked to people at you know at labs
[1:09:17.440 --> 1:09:22.880]  uh that are part human part pig i never said that said i've talked people at labs that where they have
[1:09:22.880 --> 1:09:28.240]  part human part pig chimeras that's in the associated press but they take everything in twisted it
[1:09:28.240 --> 1:09:34.560]  doesn't matter they're known liars but sardivic is now being targeted by cfr people posing as
[1:09:34.560 --> 1:09:40.960]  journalist and he's he's he's got the emails back and forth showing the anatomy of how these pr hit
[1:09:40.960 --> 1:09:48.560]  pieces masquerade is real news so mike sardivic medium dot com uh at sardivic joins us to break
[1:09:48.560 --> 1:09:55.360]  down these new developments mike sardivic yeah one thing a lot of people believe is that journalism
[1:09:55.360 --> 1:10:02.800]  is real but what happened is that McMaster and all of his deep state cronies were triggered by my
[1:10:02.800 --> 1:10:09.440]  original reporting about the war in syria about the corruption about their anti-america policy
[1:10:09.440 --> 1:10:16.160]  so rather than complain to me and send me an email they sent a journalist who works to one
[1:10:16.160 --> 1:10:21.680]  of these like council form relations style magazines or journals whatever they call themselves
[1:10:22.320 --> 1:10:28.480]  and she is now you know it was trying to interrogate me so i let her know what i thought about her
[1:10:29.040 --> 1:10:32.640]  and by the way that's when all hell broke loose and you told me you had google sources you then
[1:10:32.640 --> 1:10:37.360]  gave me the documents a week later i then separately got documents from a white house source
[1:10:37.360 --> 1:10:42.160]  that they had a directive out with me at the top i'm not bragging in fact i wish i wasn't there
[1:10:42.160 --> 1:10:50.000]  you under me and and and others there to be targeted with dis info and to be delisted off google
[1:10:51.040 --> 1:10:57.280]  and to specifically lie about us because we expose that McMaster was and you had your sources
[1:10:57.280 --> 1:11:02.000]  was trying to trick trump into a larger ground war and then when i talked to my high level
[1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:06.560]  white house source and then three days later trump came out and said word for word what my
[1:11:06.560 --> 1:11:10.720]  high level source had said that completely freaked him out because obviously they're
[1:11:10.720 --> 1:11:15.840]  recording that source and they don't like that source that high level source talking to us
[1:11:17.280 --> 1:11:23.280]  that yeah that's exactly right so this is what i told her i go what are you doing working as a
[1:11:23.280 --> 1:11:28.240]  public relations officer for for these people why don't they come to me why are they coming through
[1:11:28.240 --> 1:11:33.360]  you but this is going to be presented this hit piece to the public which by the way they keep
[1:11:33.360 --> 1:11:40.240]  bringing up hillary's health what it is yeah 60 minutes did that with you and pale he lost his
[1:11:40.240 --> 1:11:45.600]  job over that you destroyed him so bad everybody knows she has horrible health problems exactly
[1:11:45.600 --> 1:11:50.240]  i'm proud of that i'm proud of that they also bring up the pedophilia stuff and i said well
[1:11:50.240 --> 1:11:55.040]  anthony wiener is a uh child pornographer when he's going to prison look at the pope his whole
[1:11:55.040 --> 1:12:01.200]  organization's getting caught with little kids jacob schwarz a high level the vlasio staffer
[1:12:01.200 --> 1:12:07.280]  a regular guest on cnn friends of bobby mooc lolita express epstein the clinton's yeah so
[1:12:07.280 --> 1:12:10.880]  there's so many pedophiles so they try to be old clinton foundation people caught smuggling
[1:12:10.880 --> 1:12:16.240]  hundreds of kids out getting caught yeah the the hey you can't swing a bat in the dark and not hit a
[1:12:16.240 --> 1:12:21.680]  big old pedophile devil worshiper when you get around these people exactly so there's such jokes
[1:12:21.680 --> 1:12:28.240]  but i just i got tired of being nice to these people usually i don't answer but i just what i
[1:12:28.240 --> 1:12:32.960]  told her as i said that you are not a real journalist you are a mouthpiece for global
[1:12:32.960 --> 1:12:40.080]  as you are a mouthpiece for death and destruction that's all you are i let her know that you don't
[1:12:40.080 --> 1:12:46.640]  get to interrogate me you are nothing you are a garbage you are working for deep state and
[1:12:46.640 --> 1:12:50.640]  trying to murder people in the middle east you're trying to spread rape and saudi arabia
[1:12:50.640 --> 1:12:54.720]  destroying the west these people i'm done being nice to them they want to come at me
[1:12:54.720 --> 1:13:02.080]  confrontationally and act like reporters they are nothing but the mouthpiece of devil worshipers
[1:13:02.080 --> 1:13:08.640]  of pedophiles of mass murderers of the global and they are the globalist are very weak and they
[1:13:08.640 --> 1:13:13.440]  believe that they kidnap children torture them do bad things to make themselves stronger it's
[1:13:13.440 --> 1:13:18.240]  like an episode three of star wars and i'm not saying that's real folks i'm saying it's an allegory
[1:13:18.240 --> 1:13:23.840]  the writers in hollywood are telling you lucas said that movie is about dc and what dc is really
[1:13:23.840 --> 1:13:29.200]  like lucas gave an interview to variety at cans you know 10 years ago or whatever when episode
[1:13:29.200 --> 1:13:34.800]  three came out it's one of the only you know good new films and in it good new star wars
[1:13:34.800 --> 1:13:40.320]  he says palpatine says you're not really evil yet you know dark fader doesn't have like yellow eyes
[1:13:40.320 --> 1:13:45.600]  yet he goes go to the jedi center and kill hundreds of children then you'll be strong in the dark side
[1:13:45.600 --> 1:13:49.440]  and he doesn't become darth vader till he goes and kills hundreds of children and so that's what
[1:13:49.440 --> 1:13:54.320]  they're saying they do these horrible things to destroy any humanity they had and to let these
[1:13:54.320 --> 1:13:59.360]  dark forces come in and possess them now whether you believe that or not these are rights of passage
[1:13:59.360 --> 1:14:04.880]  just like gang members say go mug an old lady the right of passage is the first kidnap and rape
[1:14:04.880 --> 1:14:10.960]  children and then later kill them just like that top banker just came out in european said yeah this
[1:14:10.960 --> 1:14:16.560]  is who we're dealing with this is what we're up against and who goes to journalists in school
[1:14:16.560 --> 1:14:21.200]  then to become nothing but a spokesperson for pedophiles what what is wrong with them
[1:14:21.200 --> 1:14:26.480]  are they social pass or are they just trying to pay check i don't really know but it is disturbing
[1:14:26.480 --> 1:14:32.640]  to know that most of what you read was put there by a pedophile and that reporters aren't doing
[1:14:32.640 --> 1:14:37.840]  real journalism all they are serving as pr agents for globalist pedophiles and i love how you don't
[1:14:37.840 --> 1:14:41.200]  even give them any you know who their names are who they are they may not even know what they're
[1:14:41.200 --> 1:14:45.760]  working for but most people in the system now know we're right they now know the truth they're
[1:14:45.760 --> 1:14:50.320]  just scared to speak out that's why we're secretly as you said so much more popular and the reason i
[1:14:50.320 --> 1:14:55.600]  mentioned that is i had a guy actually two guys come over and off and on confront me at a steakhouse
[1:14:55.600 --> 1:15:01.600]  with my wife uh friday night and they would laugh at me and say everyone hates you you're a failure
[1:15:01.600 --> 1:15:05.680]  to make me feel like a failure and i said you're doing that to make me feel like a failure i said
[1:15:05.680 --> 1:15:10.960]  i love this i was actually tired and my wife was mad at me because i wasn't talking because i was
[1:15:10.960 --> 1:15:15.200]  exhausted and now i have all this energy thank you for making my night better this adrenaline rush
[1:15:15.200 --> 1:15:19.120]  i'll be able to watch a movie when i get home now that she wants me to watch and he couldn't
[1:15:19.120 --> 1:15:23.200]  believe he said oh no shake my hand i said no i'm gonna shake your hand coward i don't live in peer
[1:15:23.200 --> 1:15:28.560]  pressure like you do i mean don't they understand we're dominating don't they understand they're
[1:15:28.560 --> 1:15:34.320]  the weak minded people that want to be with the failing system well that's the beauty part of it
[1:15:34.320 --> 1:15:40.720]  is that they they're sent out to hit on us and do these nasty hit jobs on us all it does is
[1:15:40.720 --> 1:15:45.360]  validates the work because there would be no reason to come after me right now with i work
[1:15:45.360 --> 1:15:50.880]  the leading national security report oh well i'm gonna keep you with me and we've got a popping in

[1:20:06.160 --> 1:20:18.640]  in this present crisis government is not the solution to our problem government is the problem
[1:20:21.520 --> 1:20:25.920]  from time to time we've been tempted to believe that society has become too complex
[1:20:26.560 --> 1:20:33.200]  to be managed by self-rule that government by an elite group is superior to government for
[1:20:33.200 --> 1:20:42.400]  or by and of the people the alex jones show because there is a war on for your mind
[1:20:43.760 --> 1:20:48.560]  hello me all right he's just with us for one segment roger shun will be back with us tomorrow
[1:20:49.200 --> 1:20:53.120]  uh roger tells me so much amazing stuff he likes to play down his level of knowledge
[1:20:53.120 --> 1:20:58.960]  it's second to nine other than maybe the president uh and he and he told me all this stuff
[1:20:58.960 --> 1:21:03.600]  it does some of it's not exactly what he told me but just about the fact that there's no russian
[1:21:03.600 --> 1:21:07.520]  collusion all complete bowl it's come out now he's getting ready to testify to congress here in
[1:21:07.520 --> 1:21:12.560]  just a week and a half or so finally uh and then the whole thing's unraveled the clintons have been
[1:21:12.560 --> 1:21:17.920]  caught knee deep in it uh we now know they wouldn't let him into their servers the fbi and homeland
[1:21:17.920 --> 1:21:21.840]  security wanted in they wouldn't let him in because they were colluding with the russians
[1:21:21.840 --> 1:21:26.960]  the chinese and others so trump's son met with russian lawyer after being promised damaging
[1:21:26.960 --> 1:21:32.400]  information on clinton so i don't know how much roger wants to tell folks i can just tell you roger
[1:21:32.400 --> 1:21:40.800]  stone um can either confirm or deny how accurate this is uh but uh again roger stone joins us right
[1:21:40.800 --> 1:21:46.560]  now drudge asked the question were the russians setting him up regardless it's not collusion it's
[1:21:46.560 --> 1:21:52.000]  not them helping you know with computers hack in as they said i mean if hillary's committed crimes
[1:21:52.000 --> 1:21:56.640]  with the russians god bless donald trump jr for trying to find out about the espionage
[1:21:56.640 --> 1:22:03.200]  i mean is that not correct roger i think that's exactly right alex i mean in this case uh he would
[1:22:03.200 --> 1:22:10.320]  be uh it would be malpractice uh in the service of his father not to explore the facts here look
[1:22:10.320 --> 1:22:19.280]  don jr is a very bright very ardent supporter of his father's agenda a very articulate defender of
[1:22:19.280 --> 1:22:26.960]  his father on numerous issues uh he sees through the fake news and tweets about it often he is a
[1:22:26.960 --> 1:22:35.840]  patriot like we are i'm a big fan of uh don jr and he has the greatest hair since you know any on the
[1:22:35.840 --> 1:22:42.320]  monsters i think i mean the guy's just got he's got the most perfect hair i've ever seen uh in any
[1:22:42.320 --> 1:22:49.520]  but in any event i said here on info wars a couple days ago that there would be a new focus on the
[1:22:49.520 --> 1:22:56.720]  trump children that means that the nsa uh and their allies in the mainstream media who have been
[1:22:56.720 --> 1:23:05.520]  attempting to find some russian collusion we now know the story in a nutshell they the lawyer a
[1:23:05.520 --> 1:23:12.800]  woman lawyer approaches uh the trump organization to or the trumps saying that she has damaging
[1:23:12.800 --> 1:23:19.440]  information a subcommittee of others in the campaign are signed to meet with her they conclude she has
[1:23:20.240 --> 1:23:27.440]  nothing and there is no story how does this constitute collusion this is like taking uh
[1:23:27.440 --> 1:23:32.640]  you know a a nap and trying to make it significant meanwhile the democrats were all doing opposition
[1:23:32.640 --> 1:23:37.520]  research and ginning up fake dossiers meeting with russians you name it as well i mean this claim
[1:23:37.520 --> 1:23:42.160]  that oh look sessions met with russians is dirty that's playing on public interest and and public
[1:23:42.160 --> 1:23:47.520]  ignorance but it's not working anymore so you did predict two and a half months ago they'd say
[1:23:47.520 --> 1:23:52.000]  he's mentally ill all timers that started happening about a month later you did say last uh
[1:23:52.000 --> 1:23:56.160]  wednesday on the show that they would next go after his children i know you can't give up sources
[1:23:56.160 --> 1:24:01.840]  but man roger not to kiss your butt but it's true you are uncanny how dead on you are that's why i
[1:24:01.840 --> 1:24:07.760]  hate the media when they say you're this liar and this dis info artist i've never seen anything but
[1:24:07.760 --> 1:24:12.320]  uncanny accuracy from you i want you to comment on that and i want to bring in cernovich for a question
[1:24:13.200 --> 1:24:22.560]  so thank you alec look i recognize right now that the whole uh argument of collusion by the russians
[1:24:22.560 --> 1:24:29.040]  to assist down from that it's worse than a fairy tale you know it is it's a dirty track how would
[1:24:29.040 --> 1:24:35.040]  i know well they say that i'm the dirty trickster well it takes one to know one in this case i just
[1:24:35.040 --> 1:24:42.400]  ask you to examine the facts it's a narrative invented by john pedesta furthered by his allies
[1:24:42.400 --> 1:24:48.320]  in the mainstream to cover what they were guilty of it's a wait a minute picked up and run through
[1:24:48.320 --> 1:24:55.680]  the mill by their neocon allies and state and defense and throughout the the us war machine
[1:24:55.680 --> 1:25:02.960]  uh and they have still to this moment other than general flinn taking uh gratuity from
[1:25:02.960 --> 1:25:08.800]  russian tv which i don't believe is illegal is just stupid uh they don't have anything that
[1:25:08.800 --> 1:25:14.000]  constitutes collusion by exactly so what comes next now that you agreed last week trump has turned
[1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:19.680]  the corner uh did a great job in germany got a great ceasefire uh has got russia coming in against
[1:25:19.680 --> 1:25:24.400]  north korea i mean i've never seen such diplomacy but i guess it's just the the realness of trump
[1:25:24.400 --> 1:25:29.280]  he's getting such action from china you name it it seems like they're panicking i mean am i wrong
[1:25:29.280 --> 1:25:33.520]  that trump is really hitting his stride right now um i want to come back to you briefly in a moment
[1:25:33.520 --> 1:25:39.680]  but mike sternovich your observations any questions for stone well you know i think it's important
[1:25:39.680 --> 1:25:46.000]  for all of us to show don jr our support because we all know it is like to be mercilessly slanted by
[1:25:46.000 --> 1:25:50.720]  the media so you know everybody listening i think it's very important that's right it's his turn in
[1:25:50.720 --> 1:25:55.680]  the bs attack machine he's being pilloried right now up in the stocks so we've got to support him
[1:25:55.680 --> 1:26:01.120]  right now exactly that that's the number one thing we can do right now so what happened is and you
[1:26:01.120 --> 1:26:07.920]  know roger can can talk more about this don jr has the number one twitter account number one twitter
[1:26:07.920 --> 1:26:13.760]  account bar none and the media knows that they're terrified that's right he's really used it like
[1:26:13.760 --> 1:26:18.960]  nobody else roger why do they hate don jr so much because he's one of the only allies up there
[1:26:18.960 --> 1:26:27.280]  well first of all don jr as you know alex is a sportsman uh he is an avid uh hunter uh he is a
[1:26:27.280 --> 1:26:34.400]  very strong advocate of the second amendment uh he is very skeptical of a number of the neocon
[1:26:34.400 --> 1:26:42.080]  phonies who have attached themselves to the uss trump i believe he's a real patriot i have
[1:26:42.080 --> 1:26:47.440]  huge respect for donny jr would you say he's even a bigger player now for saving the republic than
[1:26:47.440 --> 1:26:54.320]  even a bannon well it's when you're the president's family alex i think you're in a separate
[1:26:54.320 --> 1:27:00.640]  category and i think that's very important to recognize and uh and i think he you know but
[1:27:00.640 --> 1:27:06.240]  based on even his own early career he's an accomplished young man uh who is doing what you
[1:27:06.240 --> 1:27:11.120]  think is right for the country and for his father's presidency he's not afraid of these bullies so how
[1:27:11.120 --> 1:27:17.280]  do they strike back now that we're really starting to win with tpp and the carbon tax and the economy
[1:27:17.280 --> 1:27:22.080]  starting to come back and exuberance the leftist bullying they're calling for violence they're
[1:27:22.080 --> 1:27:26.320]  crazier than ever what are they going to do next roger stone well i think there's going to be a
[1:27:26.320 --> 1:27:33.200]  continued focus on uh on don jr maybe even eric uh or avanka uh this is something i predict we're
[1:27:33.200 --> 1:27:41.200]  just at the very beginning of a new cycle but just as the media and the political cognizanty
[1:27:41.200 --> 1:27:50.720]  went crazy when they learned that jared kushner had opened a back channel to uh to the russians
[1:27:52.080 --> 1:27:59.040]  after the election at the time that the current his father-in-law was the president elect and
[1:27:59.040 --> 1:28:05.600]  he was authorized as staff i'm not recognizing the historical precedent of white house staff
[1:28:05.600 --> 1:28:14.080]  members having such back channel uh the conversations kissinger and china uh for for
[1:28:14.080 --> 1:28:18.800]  and sir kennedy i mean all the rest of it so they're going to try to make normal presidential
[1:28:18.800 --> 1:28:23.440]  behavior look dirty look bad every move look like a failure but it's not working anymore
[1:28:23.440 --> 1:28:28.800]  that we do agree that sienna and others are in full implode there's no question but now
[1:28:28.800 --> 1:28:36.640]  alex in my view the president has the opportunity to finish them off make no mistake about it if
[1:28:36.640 --> 1:28:45.440]  because the turning of the ship is slow uh and that that people don't get the immediate reforms
[1:28:45.440 --> 1:28:51.120]  that many you know probably had too high sure sure but but he's delivering stone cold truth
[1:28:51.120 --> 1:28:55.520]  dot com we'll talk to you tomorrow thank you more with starnevich and leo zegami from rom with big

[1:29:22.400 --> 1:29:28.320]  the network's ratings are now plummeting and there's no doubt that cnn's most recent scandal that
[1:29:28.320 --> 1:29:35.120]  sparked hashtag cnn blackmail has played a role after cnn threatened to dock some random gift

[1:35:40.160 --> 1:35:44.720]  i'm gonna play clip in a moment of leo zigami on with us monday a week before when no one
[1:35:44.720 --> 1:35:50.960]  unreported it he broke it then it was an italian news then it was an rt then it was here the next
[1:35:50.960 --> 1:35:56.720]  day nowhere else but info wars forcing it out on wednesday the gay orgy where it happened who was
[1:35:56.720 --> 1:36:03.200]  involved he's got more to break in a moment but mike sarnovich riding shotgun i have people asking
[1:36:03.200 --> 1:36:08.320]  me and my family smart folks they say it's like cnn's trying to destroy themselves and i go no no
[1:36:08.320 --> 1:36:11.680]  you've been around a mentally ill person that's megal maniacal or delusional they think they're
[1:36:11.680 --> 1:36:17.280]  invincible it's just they are they are like they are like the millennial generation on average
[1:36:17.280 --> 1:36:23.120]  where they just arts they do not get it man they have no ratings everyone hates them what is going
[1:36:23.120 --> 1:36:28.480]  on sarnovich they said no violence at the g20 it was totally loving what planet are they on
[1:36:28.480 --> 1:36:31.760]  sarnovich
[1:36:34.320 --> 1:36:40.400]  go ahead yeah they definitely they're drunk with power as hubris they believe because nobody's ever
[1:36:40.400 --> 1:36:46.400]  pushed back against them or nobody's ever called them out as we know the new york times and the
[1:36:46.400 --> 1:36:51.760]  washington post won't call out cnn for being fake news they'll only go after you and me and pick
[1:36:51.760 --> 1:36:57.520]  every little thing we say or do so they got they got used to it what they're doing is a rational
[1:36:57.520 --> 1:37:03.280]  response to the way they've conducted themselves for decades they got away with it for so long
[1:37:03.280 --> 1:37:09.600]  they think well why not keep doing it i agree i want to invite you back up tomorrow and i
[1:37:09.600 --> 1:37:13.600]  don't want to invite leo zagami on for like an hour soon so you can take calls because he's the
[1:37:13.600 --> 1:37:18.400]  expert let's play a clip with him last monday and again the week before he broke it like the day it
[1:37:18.400 --> 1:37:23.280]  happened he forced it out and i'm not trying to kiss his butt but that's why independent journals
[1:37:23.280 --> 1:37:30.480]  are so important now like info wars like sarnovich like like zagami leozagami.com because it forces
[1:37:30.480 --> 1:37:35.520]  the msm to cover it let's go ahead and play that clip of zagami breaking the gay orgy news
[1:37:35.520 --> 1:37:41.200]  well it's happening and it's happening clearly in front of the whole world with george pell but
[1:37:41.200 --> 1:37:48.400]  it's an also an internal conflict a few days before george pell got booted out of the Vatican
[1:37:48.400 --> 1:37:54.960]  we had basically the police breaking inside the palace of the holy office the ex inquisition
[1:37:54.960 --> 1:38:00.960]  now known as the congregation for the matters of faith basically the headquarters of the most
[1:38:00.960 --> 1:38:08.080]  holy office in the Vatican the police broke in and found a gay orgy and they were using cocaine
[1:38:08.080 --> 1:38:15.200]  and they basically had to arrest the secretary of a very prominent cardinal who himself was waging
[1:38:15.200 --> 1:38:22.400]  war against cardinal pell so there is also an internal war here and of course nobody wanted
[1:38:22.400 --> 1:38:30.640]  to show the the face of this priest but i wanted to show it to your viewers it's called monsignor
[1:38:30.640 --> 1:38:37.920]  luigi kapotsi and only very few media i think only rt probably just mentioned the name of
[1:38:37.920 --> 1:38:43.280]  kapotsi's boss this cardinal that's good and he goes on to say it's all happening because
[1:38:43.280 --> 1:38:47.840]  trump and other people have green lighted going after him record arrest leo zagami i know it's
[1:38:47.840 --> 1:38:52.480]  like one in the morning or later they're in rom time thank you for joining us please recap
[1:38:52.480 --> 1:38:56.480]  since you were on a week ago what's happened i know you have some new developments as well
[1:38:56.480 --> 1:39:03.360]  thank you so much for joining us well yes we managed to break through into the traditional
[1:39:03.360 --> 1:39:08.640]  media with our scoop i mean they didn't want to tell the name of the people involved they were
[1:39:08.640 --> 1:39:14.960]  kind of covering everything up with a little article that came out on an italian newspaper
[1:39:14.960 --> 1:39:20.400]  at the end of june but nobody was mentioning neither luigi kapotsi neither the cardinal
[1:39:20.960 --> 1:39:29.760]  coco palmiero who is behind luigi kapotsi and the georgi so now instead one week later finally
[1:39:29.760 --> 1:39:35.280]  after the international media has really taken the story after we broke it for everybody alex
[1:39:35.280 --> 1:39:42.080]  because the story was completely new for everybody in the english word and now in italy they are
[1:39:42.080 --> 1:39:49.760]  finally saying putting this whole situation in a different context by detailing the names of the
[1:39:49.760 --> 1:39:59.280]  people involved and it's been an unseen scoop that i didn't see really coming but once we got it going
[1:39:59.280 --> 1:40:05.760]  they are really have to they're forcing themselves to say where luigi kapotsi has ended because he
[1:40:05.760 --> 1:40:12.240]  was in a monastery you remember i told you he was sent in a monastery now apparently he's been sent
[1:40:13.200 --> 1:40:19.600]  he's at the polyclinical gemelli which is actually the hospital where i was born near the vatican
[1:40:19.600 --> 1:40:25.760]  and in the polyclinical gemelli he is going through a rehabilitation because he's a complete cocaine
[1:40:25.760 --> 1:40:32.000]  addict so they had to take him off from the monastery and put him back into the hospital
[1:40:32.000 --> 1:40:37.680]  so the head priest involved in all this is is is basically in drug rehab right now uh leo zagami
[1:40:37.680 --> 1:40:42.560]  breaking this and leo again this is how they control people what are the latest developments
[1:40:42.560 --> 1:40:46.480]  because that was a footnote when you were on you were mainly talking about the pope's deputy being
[1:40:46.480 --> 1:40:50.960]  being indicted for rounding up and raping hundreds of boys and i guess procuring them what's the
[1:40:50.960 --> 1:40:56.400]  latest on that then mike sternum has jumped at any time well the latest on pope france is
[1:40:56.400 --> 1:41:03.280]  is even more interesting because he has given this exclusive interview to uh ugenius calphery who is
[1:41:03.280 --> 1:41:10.720]  this uh traditional fake news italian founder of this big newspaper kola republica and he gave him
[1:41:10.720 --> 1:41:17.280]  this interview right in the middle of this gay orgy scandal he suddenly calls in this journalist
[1:41:17.280 --> 1:41:25.200]  and he doesn't mention the scandal whatsoever he only mentions the g20 the fear he has of america
[1:41:25.200 --> 1:41:31.680]  of russia and he wants to just promote uh promote that was my next question why is the pope the
[1:41:31.680 --> 1:41:36.640]  false pope so scared of the russia u.s alliance because my intel folks we told him six months ago
[1:41:36.640 --> 1:41:42.320]  it's the christian world linking up trying to save europe the pope as allied with islam is what my
[1:41:42.320 --> 1:41:48.640]  intel is is that accurate absolutely yes in fact i have mentioned this also in my latest book volume
[1:41:48.640 --> 1:41:54.960]  three of my confessions the fact that now putin and trump are starting to find finally common ground
[1:41:54.960 --> 1:42:01.120]  by meeting each other without intermediaries or without a phone this is a great thing and i think
[1:42:01.120 --> 1:42:07.920]  will lead to great things to come in fact out of the g20 nothing else came out apart from trump and
[1:42:07.920 --> 1:42:16.480]  putin and their deals the rest was a complete failure and even macron uh was running for having
[1:42:16.480 --> 1:42:24.800]  the photo next to trump and of course putin was a center stage and turkey is now siding more than
[1:42:24.800 --> 1:42:31.440]  ever with putin with trump against what are these failing mondialists these liberals these people like
[1:42:31.440 --> 1:42:37.040]  the clinton foundation that is closing down and all these other people from the liberal media

[1:49:31.920 --> 1:49:36.480]  the globalist certain about you i know you've got a few questions you've been on target exposing the
[1:49:36.480 --> 1:49:41.840]  petafal rings but zygami has really been on target you i'm sure you've got some questions for him i
[1:49:41.840 --> 1:49:48.080]  mean how big is it that the pope's deputy pope indicted for reportedly raping hundreds of children
[1:49:48.080 --> 1:49:53.600]  trafficking in them everything our intel had told us zygami says that it's trump behind this
[1:49:54.160 --> 1:49:58.640]  what do you make of that what are your questions for zygami yeah i was wondering at the clinton
[1:49:58.640 --> 1:50:04.240]  foundation were they getting any children from haydee is there perhaps a clean global initiative
[1:50:04.240 --> 1:50:12.240]  haydee connection to these petafal rings going on right now there is a of course connections with
[1:50:12.240 --> 1:50:19.760]  all the values o n g's the values groups that of course portray themselves as the saviors every
[1:50:19.760 --> 1:50:26.240]  time but they are just a network that is constructed of intelligence services and governments and of
[1:50:26.240 --> 1:50:32.880]  course the pedophile elite take advantage of all this and uses it as his own network to take in more
[1:50:32.880 --> 1:50:38.880]  and more young children and this happens every day unfortunately yeah i've heard that a lot of the
[1:50:38.880 --> 1:50:46.080]  n g o's are just a front office for a front for petafal networks in fact there was a cable
[1:50:46.080 --> 1:50:51.760]  that was you know leaked by wiki leaks which is that during the hasian earthquake a lot of so-called
[1:50:51.760 --> 1:50:57.920]  cherry groups went down there and they were actually these front groups of pedophiles well of course
[1:50:57.920 --> 1:51:03.440]  n g o's then in particular the ones that are connected to the clinton foundation are connected
[1:51:03.440 --> 1:51:09.200]  also to the catholic world let's not forget that the clinton foundation works very closely
[1:51:09.200 --> 1:51:17.600]  with the jazz whites like in the case of turkey why we see erdogan so close to putin and trump
[1:51:17.600 --> 1:51:24.800]  these days because he suffered the coop by fetula gulen who himself made a book with the
[1:51:24.800 --> 1:51:32.560]  preface by one of the jazz white leaders thomas michel and thomas michel was actually in turkey
[1:51:32.560 --> 1:51:40.960]  for two years before the attempted coop to service uh this coop people sure i know this you talk about
[1:51:40.960 --> 1:51:46.000]  gulan nobody comes after you like they do i mean i mean you i mean they are something else
[1:51:46.000 --> 1:51:52.320]  they are something else for sure but as you know i know them for many many years unfortunately i was
[1:51:52.320 --> 1:51:59.600]  involved with them many years ago so i have some inside internet on them and and i'm not afraid of
[1:51:59.600 --> 1:52:05.200]  them but of course i will not go back to turkey knowing that they are around leo zagami amazing
[1:52:05.200 --> 1:52:09.600]  i've been asking the question so has sarnovich but you're a real investigative journalist i mean
[1:52:09.600 --> 1:52:13.680]  just i mean i thought you were nuts for an hour first one about ten years ago it's all come true
[1:52:13.680 --> 1:52:17.600]  i've read several of your books amazing i've known you've been on target at least three years
[1:52:17.600 --> 1:52:23.280]  what what are other shoes about to drop what are what's other news in italy uh or other areas we
[1:52:23.280 --> 1:52:28.080]  don't know about what other top catholic cardinals are running pedophile rings from your research
[1:52:28.080 --> 1:52:31.920]  because now at this point they're all suspect most of them have been caught we know it's a
[1:52:31.920 --> 1:52:38.240]  pedophile network well the biggest news of the last couple of days has been this interview
[1:52:38.240 --> 1:52:44.240]  uh that pope francis gave to scalfrey because he mentioned in this interview that he wants to
[1:52:44.240 --> 1:52:50.560]  destroy any national sovereignty in favor of a federal government centralized government in
[1:52:50.560 --> 1:52:57.280]  europe and this is really getting people mad in italy so uh my friends from scionary economicy
[1:52:57.280 --> 1:53:04.000]  which is a very popular website has started a pool until tuesday asking what they think of
[1:53:04.000 --> 1:53:10.000]  popes involvement in politics which is now outspoken and unprecedented that's right and and
[1:53:11.040 --> 1:53:15.040]  we have new listeners here i'm not anti-catholic calakson a lot of great things and of course
[1:53:15.040 --> 1:53:19.360]  you're catholic a christian catholic and you work to keep a christian but if you look at it
[1:53:20.480 --> 1:53:24.960]  i mean the pope this year said it makes him sick to hear about european christian he wants to bring
[1:53:24.960 --> 1:53:29.280]  in muslims he doesn't let him into the vatican but he wants everybody else to come and take over
[1:53:29.280 --> 1:53:34.880]  it's totally insane and then now he is covering up for pedophiles firing all the conservatives
[1:53:34.880 --> 1:53:41.440]  that have been fighting it as all this comes out he says that trump is bad he says that russia and
[1:53:41.440 --> 1:53:46.400]  the u.s shouldn't work together he says an e u army should take over countries for those that
[1:53:46.400 --> 1:53:51.120]  don't know the interviews all over the news he says uh again that trump is dangerous putin is
[1:53:51.120 --> 1:53:57.360]  dangerous i mean this guy is so evil who wouldn't want peace so so who really controls him leo
[1:53:57.360 --> 1:54:02.400]  zegami and i want to get started but just take on that because it's such a big deal to have this guy
[1:54:02.400 --> 1:54:08.320]  go 100 against catholic christian doctrine and then how long can he go how far can he go because
[1:54:08.320 --> 1:54:13.440]  as you know italy voted months ago to not expand e u control the e you wanted to put an e u army
[1:54:13.440 --> 1:54:19.680]  inside italy so as you said italy is waking up it's a crazy thing is that italian politicians in
[1:54:19.680 --> 1:54:25.280]  the last few days even the left wing politicians says we can't take any more immigrants any more
[1:54:25.280 --> 1:54:31.520]  refugees so the pope is going even against the people who have been always connected to him
[1:54:31.520 --> 1:54:36.720]  like the left wing politicians like the renzi the gentilon the the prime minister we have now
[1:54:36.720 --> 1:54:42.560]  so i mean this has shocked everybody the fact that the pope has tweeted on the 8th of july which is
[1:54:43.200 --> 1:54:50.560]  also a very particular date because uh four years ago in 2013 in july 2013 he went to
[1:54:50.560 --> 1:54:57.600]  lampedusa which is the closest island to africa that italy has and he made this mass which was
[1:54:57.600 --> 1:55:02.720]  basically the kickstart for the invasion which is of course programmed together with george
[1:55:02.720 --> 1:55:07.520]  soros and his own and soros pays for the boats that go 90 miles off grab them exactly this whole
[1:55:07.520 --> 1:55:12.640]  thing's greased to bring down europe to bring in incompatible muslims to then take the free speech
[1:55:12.640 --> 1:55:17.360]  and then but finally bill gates comes out as you know thursday and says okay europe's falling
[1:55:17.360 --> 1:55:21.840]  even bill gates who's a big globalist is saying but but but he it's not that he's against it he
[1:55:21.840 --> 1:55:27.360]  says europe's so mad you're about to lose full control even he's telling the globalist they
[1:55:27.360 --> 1:55:32.640]  need to back off what do you make of that leo zegami i think that bill gates is a person who
[1:55:32.640 --> 1:55:37.840]  is realistic he knows that if he continues like this within a very short period of time we will
[1:55:37.840 --> 1:55:44.560]  start with civil unrest is already happening in in big cities in italy and the last few days
[1:55:44.560 --> 1:55:51.840]  we had a refugee attacking a person on a train a driver on a train a conductor of a train and
[1:55:51.840 --> 1:55:58.560]  actually biting him like a cannibal we had people going around with machetes yeah people don't know
[1:55:58.560 --> 1:56:02.640]  that north africa and the middle east the people that are coming in at least it's literally like
[1:56:02.640 --> 1:56:07.760]  road warrior it is literally women and slave cages i mean it beyond anything we've ever imagined
[1:56:07.760 --> 1:56:12.240]  let's get some final statements from investigative journalist and questions or comments for leo
[1:56:12.240 --> 1:56:17.200]  zegami uh from of course mike sernovich who'll be joining us tomorrow he's launching he's got a lot
[1:56:17.200 --> 1:56:21.920]  of big films like the red pill he helped produce with a kickstarter he's got a big one about hoaxed
[1:56:21.920 --> 1:56:27.360]  exposing mainstream media we'll talk about that more but other points uh mike yeah definitely i would
[1:56:27.360 --> 1:56:34.320]  wonder about the death threats does mr zegami find that the media in italy goes after him and lies
