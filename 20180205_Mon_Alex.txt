[00:00:11.388 --> 00:00:16.241]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:00:16.241 --> 00:00:17.545]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:00:34.591 --> 00:00:43.616]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this Monday, the 5th day of February, 2018.
[00:00:43.616 --> 00:00:47.038]  Every show gets more power-packed because time is compressing.
[00:00:47.038 --> 00:00:48.339]  We're headed towards the singularity.
[00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:51.041]  It is an incredible time to be alive.
[00:00:51.041 --> 00:01:00.847]  The Eagles have the big upset win, and the big story behind the story is that it was the binding force of their Christian faith, according to the coach and the players.
[00:01:01.854 --> 00:01:08.316]  That had them break the back of the NFL's globalist poison.
[00:01:08.316 --> 00:01:12.196]  And that's why all of them unanimously have not kneeled.
[00:01:12.196 --> 00:01:16.978]  That's why they've been basically immune to the Hollywood brainwashing.
[00:01:16.978 --> 00:01:19.498]  And that's the story behind the story.
[00:01:19.498 --> 00:01:22.799]  That's coming up in the broadcast.
[00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.580]  Also, obviously, we have a whole nother twist on that front.
[00:01:28.086 --> 00:01:37.364]  Colts Edwin Jackson starring linebacker killed after being struck by suspected drunk driver and the media didn't get it right nationally locally they did
[00:01:38.809 --> 00:01:41.831]  Liberal media wouldn't say the guy was an illegal alien.
[00:01:41.831 --> 00:01:46.094]  Conservative media would say he was from Mexico, deported twice.
[00:01:46.094 --> 00:01:50.817]  No, he was from Guatemala, deported at least twice, an illegal alien.
[00:01:50.817 --> 00:01:58.182]  And the issue here is they won't say it when you see somebody run over folks in France or Germany or shoot people or bomb them.
[00:01:58.182 --> 00:02:00.764]  They'll say a German man attacked people with a truck today.
[00:02:01.596 --> 00:02:04.239]  And then he's been there two years, he's a quote, migrant refugee.
[00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:05.700]  And it's the same thing with that.
[00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:23.898]  If you were an illegal alien in Mexico, from wherever in the world, say China, the U.S., wherever, and you run over somebody drunk, they'd say, in the country illegally, this individual ran over X.
[00:02:25.171 --> 00:02:32.294]  It's such a unified front all over the Western world for the left to cover up the crime statistics.
[00:02:32.294 --> 00:02:37.916]  And the big one with illegals is the serious, serious, serious drunk driving.
[00:02:37.916 --> 00:02:40.037]  But it just shows the media controls.
[00:02:40.037 --> 00:02:42.598]  We're going to go through all the different sections of that.
[00:02:42.598 --> 00:02:45.039]  There's a very illustrative quote.
[00:02:46.457 --> 00:02:53.202]  An audiophile from a podcast he was on, Jimmy Kimmel, who used to be funny, has turned into a total mouthpiece, of Chuckie Schumer.
[00:02:53.202 --> 00:03:02.588]  He talks to Chuckie Schumer, he said, pretty much seven days a week, but five nights a week, he talks to him about what to put in his monologue, what to say, what to do.
[00:03:02.588 --> 00:03:07.472]  The Democrats also work with Colbert, you name it, and you can see the talking points there every day.
[00:03:08.655 --> 00:03:15.860]  But he's come out and said, Libs excel at late night hosting because job requires intelligence.
[00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:29.930]  No, we know for a fact that Jay Leno is more of a libertarian, certainly not a liberal, and that he had double the ratings of his replacement, and that he was rooted out because he isn't vicious and nasty.
[00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.271]  And he's spoken about that.
[00:03:31.271 --> 00:03:33.533]  So people that have better ratings than you,
[00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:42.342]  I mean, how many other TV hosts, how many other comics have been removed off of their television programs?
[00:03:42.342 --> 00:03:47.804]  Mr. Allen last year, the list goes on and on, because they didn't toe the line even though he had a hit show.
[00:03:47.804 --> 00:03:55.607]  By the way, in talk radio and in the publication world and so many other areas, it's universally
[00:03:56.724 --> 00:04:08.394]  Libertarians and conservatives and nationalists, where you've got to stand alone and really talk for hours and hours, there are not leftists that can ever be successful or get ratings.
[00:04:08.394 --> 00:04:09.475]  No one.
[00:04:09.475 --> 00:04:16.921]  They all get talking points, they read off teleprompters, they wear fancy suits, and they say the same thing.
[00:04:16.921 --> 00:04:21.145]  Saturday Night Live, Nunes is a slave, a rat.
[00:04:21.145 --> 00:04:24.208]  Same thing was said on Bill Maher's program.
[00:04:25.643 --> 00:04:27.786]  He's a dirty rat.
[00:04:27.786 --> 00:04:35.194]  They get the talking point, they regurgitate it, reading off a teleprompter, and then they call that smart, and they celebrate how smart they are.
[00:04:35.194 --> 00:04:36.296]  Sorry.
[00:04:36.296 --> 00:04:38.518]  I've been to your rallies.
[00:04:38.518 --> 00:04:40.561]  I've seen your constituents.
[00:04:40.561 --> 00:04:43.644]  They look like they've been shot with a mutation ray.
[00:04:43.644 --> 00:04:44.806]  They look like the undead.
[00:04:45.848 --> 00:04:46.709]  Everybody knows it.
[00:04:46.709 --> 00:04:50.971]  Everybody knows you prey on a giant, dumbed-down, poor population.
[00:04:50.971 --> 00:04:56.814]  Now, on the top, the richest people, three to one, are leftist, because they're parasites feeding on their slaves.
[00:04:56.814 --> 00:04:57.434]  That part's true.
[00:05:00.225 --> 00:05:04.626]  Fuel your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[00:05:04.626 --> 00:05:12.708]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestive process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[00:05:12.708 --> 00:05:17.989]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[00:05:17.989 --> 00:05:20.529]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:24.750]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.191]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[00:05:27.871 --> 00:05:35.122]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.
[00:05:35.122 --> 00:05:42.312]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[00:05:43.173 --> 00:05:50.357]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[00:05:50.357 --> 00:05:51.818]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[00:05:51.818 --> 00:05:54.459]  Use Carnivore by InfoWarsLife.
[00:05:54.459 --> 00:05:57.941]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com and secure your bottle now.
[00:05:57.941 --> 00:05:59.641]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:31.322]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:31.322 --> 00:06:37.984]  The first thing I want to cover out of the gates today is what I'm going to be covering in the next four hours.
[00:06:37.984 --> 00:06:38.584]  And that is
[00:06:39.895 --> 00:06:49.898]  The incredible lies of Little Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Select Intelligence Committee.
[00:06:49.898 --> 00:07:09.044]  Little Adam Schiff, it turns out, was a favorite on RT over the years, even when Obama was in office, saying that the FISA court should be transparent, and shouldn't be political, and that their activities should be made public.
[00:07:12.583 --> 00:07:15.406]  And this video has gotten basically no attention.
[00:07:15.406 --> 00:07:20.952]  It's up on Infowars.com and Newswars.com, an article that Paul Watson wrote.
[00:07:20.952 --> 00:07:33.725]  And then we've got videos beneath it of him on Fox News over the weekend and other networks saying there's going to be a new Oklahoma City bombing if you keep making this political.
[00:07:34.565 --> 00:07:49.354]  You made it political lying with DNC funding, and you've been involved we now know, going to the FISA court and then having a bunch of Democrat operatives at the top of the FBI and Justice Department sit around and try to keep Trump out of office!
[00:07:49.354 --> 00:07:50.315]  It has to come out!
[00:07:52.403 --> 00:07:53.443]  It's amazing!
[00:07:53.443 --> 00:07:55.044]  You did spy on the President.
[00:07:55.044 --> 00:08:13.271]  You guys went all over television starting in late January of last year, so a little more than a year ago, and said on every channel over and over again like parrots, until my head was going to explode, that there was never any spying on anybody in Trump's entourage, his campaign zero.
[00:08:13.271 --> 00:08:15.272]  Now they just previously until January 20th,
[00:08:17.349 --> 00:08:22.570]  Been everywhere, New York Times, Washington Post, saying, we had spying on Trump Tower.
[00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:24.171]  We were spying on his campaign.
[00:08:24.171 --> 00:08:25.371]  You better watch it, Trump.
[00:08:25.371 --> 00:08:27.071]  We've got evidence you're a Russian.
[00:08:27.071 --> 00:08:28.392]  They were bluffing.
[00:08:28.392 --> 00:08:30.452]  They were hoping there was something there.
[00:08:30.452 --> 00:08:41.354]  They had Susan Rice, all of them in the White House, we now know, in daily briefings with Obama, who ordered it, listening to everything they were doing, with hundreds of people dialed in.
[00:08:41.354 --> 00:08:43.195]  I mean, they had a war room going.
[00:08:44.582 --> 00:09:03.908]  Admiral Rogers, on the 17th of November of 2016, when the president had only been in office, elect, 10 days, not even in office but president elect, 10 days, went to Trump Tower to brief him and said, sir, you were illegally surveilled.
[00:09:03.908 --> 00:09:06.948]  That's why they then, days later, said that was unauthorized.
[00:09:06.948 --> 00:09:08.789]  Well, he's the incoming president, that's normal.
[00:09:10.526 --> 00:09:17.832]  Then they all called Clapper and Brennan for his firing because he wasn't a traitor.
[00:09:17.832 --> 00:09:19.974]  So think about this.
[00:09:19.974 --> 00:09:36.327]  They're all over the news in September and October and November, recklessly saying, we know they're all Russian agents, we've been spying on them.
[00:09:37.455 --> 00:09:47.258]  Trump gets in, Rogers comes and meets, Rogers explains how it was illegal, how the FISA court three times refused it, and they came back with orders from Obama.
[00:09:47.258 --> 00:09:54.460]  Rogers explains, sir, you can't release it until you're actively the president, then you can, but you need to know what's happened.
[00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:58.100]  Trump becomes president.
[00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:00.161]  He's sworn in on the 20th of January, 2017.
[00:10:05.253 --> 00:10:08.115]  And then he says, there's a lot of leaking going on.
[00:10:08.115 --> 00:10:09.256]  There's been spying on me.
[00:10:09.256 --> 00:10:10.417]  It's illegal.
[00:10:10.417 --> 00:10:12.759]  And it's going to come out soon to the proper channels.
[00:10:12.759 --> 00:10:18.123]  They all lie and say Trump is insane.
[00:10:18.123 --> 00:10:19.684]  No one ever spied.
[00:10:19.684 --> 00:10:26.529]  Comey goes and testifies no one ever spied on anybody in the Trump campaign or any of his entourage.
[00:10:26.529 --> 00:10:28.290]  Mueller says it.
[00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:29.851]  Rosenstein says it.
[00:10:29.851 --> 00:10:31.072]  Clapper says it.
[00:10:31.072 --> 00:10:32.173]  Brennan says it.
[00:10:32.173 --> 00:10:34.535]  They all go on television.
[00:10:35.777 --> 00:10:40.698]  Under oath and say, this is insane, close quote.
[00:10:40.698 --> 00:10:45.400]  The president is crazy, close quote.
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:52.042]  Even though they were all on record saying, you watch it buddy, there's seven ways to Sunday the intelligence community to bring you down.
[00:10:52.042 --> 00:10:54.142]  We've been spying on you and we have the intercepts.
[00:10:54.142 --> 00:10:56.563]  Remember when Schumer said that on CNN?
[00:10:56.563 --> 00:11:00.564]  We have them all bragging until the president goes, you know that's illegal.
[00:11:02.079 --> 00:11:03.300]  And you know, leaking it's illegal.
[00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:05.681]  And they went, oh gosh, he's the president now.
[00:11:05.681 --> 00:11:06.161]  You're crazy!
[00:11:06.161 --> 00:11:06.641]  You're insane!
[00:11:06.641 --> 00:11:07.861]  No one was spying on you!
[00:11:07.861 --> 00:11:15.004]  In a 24-hour period from the 20th, we're on the front page of the paper.
[00:11:15.004 --> 00:11:17.946]  Wiretaps of Trump Tower prove Russian collusion.
[00:11:17.946 --> 00:11:19.306]  Roger Stone's an agent.
[00:11:19.306 --> 00:11:21.987]  We have him under direct command under Putin.
[00:11:21.987 --> 00:11:23.648]  Totally made up.
[00:11:23.648 --> 00:11:25.909]  Black Shane's under direct command of Mary Poppins.
[00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:29.512]  Trump goes, you know, that's all illegal.
[00:11:29.512 --> 00:11:31.253]  The next day they go, you're insane!
[00:11:31.253 --> 00:11:32.093]  We never said it!
[00:11:32.093 --> 00:11:32.934]  It's crazy!
[00:11:32.934 --> 00:11:34.595]  Oh my gosh!
[00:11:34.595 --> 00:11:48.805]  And I know you all remember this, but it's key to get this out to everybody and to take this live video and slash radio transmission, and I'm going to post this later, InfoWars, this little segment, and send it out to your friends and family, because I can't tell you how many people
[00:11:49.673 --> 00:12:06.482]  They've called me and texted me from Hollywood, media, Congress, you name it, and said, will you send me one of your best videos explaining, because I'm arguing with my wife that there was illegal spying, but she's saying there wasn't, but now they're admitting there was.
[00:12:06.482 --> 00:12:10.584]  This is an important topic because they didn't just get the warrants illegally with lies.
[00:12:10.584 --> 00:12:12.565]  They didn't just perjure themselves to Congress.
[00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:17.208]  They lied to everybody and said they never spied on anybody in the Trump entourage when you have
[00:12:19.346 --> 00:12:31.832]  The Nunes Memo, and then you've got the actual 99-page investigation put out last year, and got attention a few weeks ago, of the FISA Court.
[00:12:31.832 --> 00:12:33.833]  Where they said it was illegal, what was going on.
[00:12:33.833 --> 00:12:36.254]  This is their own report!
[00:12:36.254 --> 00:12:37.574]  To the President!
[00:12:37.574 --> 00:12:42.637]  Saying, sir, this is what happened to you.
[00:12:42.637 --> 00:12:45.278]  And you got Peter Schiff fighting to have any of this released.
[00:12:47.469 --> 00:12:49.010]  Because him and Obama are both involved.
[00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:50.430]  That's why they're so scared.
[00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:51.531]  That's why they're so bug-eyed.
[00:12:51.531 --> 00:12:54.752]  That's why they're so desperate, because they thought they would get away with this.
[00:12:54.752 --> 00:12:56.812]  They thought Hillary was going to end up being elected.
[00:12:56.812 --> 00:13:14.199]  So, now Nunes, as Trump said in his cover letter last week, is getting ready to release a bunch of other damning information, because they're not backing down where they threatened to go after the President physically, where they're getting orders to take him down, where they're talking in text messages about leaking
[00:13:15.629 --> 00:13:24.255]  Classified information, which didn't even contain treason or crime, but they claim it's a leak, so it makes it one.
[00:13:24.255 --> 00:13:25.176]  You understand?
[00:13:25.176 --> 00:13:32.422]  So they're using the secrecy wall to make stuff up, and then pass it through, like Comey and others got caught doing.
[00:13:32.422 --> 00:13:43.650]  So, they want it, it's all gonna happen, and see, they can't give up, because they're innately criminal, and they know they're criminal, and their whole system's going over the edge right now.
[00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:44.811]  So the next big question is,
[00:13:46.442 --> 00:13:48.883]  What are they gonna pull next?
[00:13:48.883 --> 00:14:10.835]  Because they spied on a candidate, the Republican nominee, President-elect, right through the day he was President, and it came out they had their deep state people still in the NSA, still in the FBI, still in the CIA, and they were still leaking disinfo against the country.
[00:14:12.858 --> 00:14:16.881]  It's being reported Nunes wants to publish as many as five more memos.
[00:14:16.881 --> 00:14:18.282]  What did I say two weeks ago?
[00:14:18.282 --> 00:14:30.512]  I said I'm told it's a roadmap for more memos to come out that are going to be extensive with the bibliography, with the fact sheets, with a roadmap.
[00:14:30.512 --> 00:14:36.537]  Some of these memos they're saying are going to be hundreds of pages long of just text messages.
[00:14:40.063 --> 00:14:41.924]  We're gonna get this son of a bitch.
[00:14:41.924 --> 00:14:43.524]  Don't worry, we're gonna bring him down.
[00:14:43.524 --> 00:14:48.346]  You know, if we can't find it, we're gonna have to make it up.
[00:14:48.346 --> 00:14:53.127]  If we can't get him on Russian Connections, we're gonna say he obstructed justice.
[00:14:53.127 --> 00:14:56.568]  We gotta get somebody to roll and say that he said something that isn't true.
[00:14:56.568 --> 00:14:59.629]  I mean, they've already told the public what's there.
[00:14:59.629 --> 00:15:01.710]  I've talked to the sources.
[00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:03.551]  You think this other stuff hurt the FBI?
[00:15:04.875 --> 00:15:10.397]  What's hurting it is, they won't roll over and stop their criminal activity at the Clinton Crime Network.
[00:15:10.397 --> 00:15:12.878]  And the media, the globalist media won't give up.
[00:15:12.878 --> 00:15:17.380]  So, it's going to have to all come out.
[00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:23.842]  It's kind of like, you know, your child doesn't care about the trash, doesn't do the right things, so you take away extra allowance.
[00:15:23.842 --> 00:15:25.623]  And they don't do that, so you ground them.
[00:15:25.623 --> 00:15:29.204]  They don't do that, you got to get serious.
[00:15:29.204 --> 00:15:30.405]  You're going to go to military school.
[00:15:31.843 --> 00:15:34.425]  I'm gonna sign your ass up, ship you off.
[00:15:34.425 --> 00:15:36.447]  You get your ass in gear right now.
[00:15:36.447 --> 00:15:38.088]  You see, it's the same thing.
[00:15:38.088 --> 00:15:40.330]  We're sitting here going, man, listen.
[00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:41.671]  We're not gonna stop.
[00:15:41.671 --> 00:15:42.752]  You're not stopping.
[00:15:42.752 --> 00:15:44.053]  And we got the goods on you.
[00:15:44.053 --> 00:15:45.554]  You don't have crap.
[00:15:45.554 --> 00:15:47.755]  So their only hope's killing the president.
[00:15:47.755 --> 00:15:49.397]  That's the bottom line.
[00:15:49.397 --> 00:15:50.117]  We'll be back.
[00:15:50.117 --> 00:15:51.498]  This is the Info War.
[00:15:51.498 --> 00:15:56.102]  Spread those links, spread those articles, spread the live feeds, and tell folks about the local stations.
[00:15:56.102 --> 00:15:57.163]  It's an act of rebellion.
[00:15:59.704 --> 00:16:00.504]  This is Dan Pilla.
[00:16:00.504 --> 00:16:02.325]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[00:16:02.325 --> 00:16:03.966]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[00:16:03.966 --> 00:16:06.787]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[00:16:06.787 --> 00:16:09.088]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[00:16:09.088 --> 00:16:13.590]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:17.532]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.

[00:16:28.803 --> 00:16:33.926]  The answer to being in control of your own health care is freedom from insurance.
[00:16:33.926 --> 00:16:39.629]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's medical expenses.
[00:16:39.629 --> 00:16:44.832]  Individual share amounts begin at $107 a month and $347 for families.
[00:16:44.832 --> 00:16:46.773]  Choose from three health sharing programs.
[00:16:46.773 --> 00:16:49.135]  Holistic treatments may be eligible for sharing.
[00:16:49.135 --> 00:16:50.095]  See guidelines.
[00:16:50.095 --> 00:16:53.377]  Discount programs available for dental, vision, and pharmacy.
[00:16:53.377 --> 00:16:55.338]  Go to LibertyOnCall.org.
[00:16:55.338 --> 00:16:57.179]  That's LibertyOnCall.org.
[00:16:59.028 --> 00:17:00.990]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:06.314]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:17:06.314 --> 00:17:07.896]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:17:07.896 --> 00:17:16.263]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[00:17:22.108 --> 00:17:23.950]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:26.113]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:17:26.113 --> 00:17:30.599]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:17:30.599 --> 00:17:32.801]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.

[00:18:00.191 --> 00:18:09.301]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:18:09.301 --> 00:18:17.690]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:22.375]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:18:22.575 --> 00:18:29.359]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:18:29.359 --> 00:18:36.543]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:18:36.543 --> 00:18:43.567]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:18:43.567 --> 00:18:47.890]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:52.455]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that
[00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:20.020]  When you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:22.141]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[00:19:22.141 --> 00:19:26.105]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:19:26.105 --> 00:19:27.346]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but
[00:19:27.586 --> 00:19:33.370]  We've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:35.772]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[00:19:35.772 --> 00:19:38.413]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[00:19:38.413 --> 00:19:39.314]  That's my dad.
[00:19:39.314 --> 00:19:41.195]  With colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[00:19:41.195 --> 00:19:43.697]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:19:43.697 --> 00:19:52.883]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[00:19:52.883 --> 00:19:57.326]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[00:20:03.293 --> 00:20:05.896]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:25.891 --> 00:20:28.572]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:20:28.572 --> 00:20:45.681]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:20:45.681 --> 00:20:46.821]  Welcome back.
[00:20:46.821 --> 00:20:48.742]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[00:20:48.742 --> 00:20:50.163]  It is Monday, the fifth day.
[00:20:51.704 --> 00:20:54.146]  February 2018.
[00:20:54.146 --> 00:20:59.470]  Later in this hour, I'm going to drill back into the memos.
[00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:02.272]  The Democrats want to put out their own memo.
[00:21:02.272 --> 00:21:11.559]  You've got Nunes saying he's got five more big memos that absolutely devastate Comey, Mueller, and the rest of them.
[00:21:11.559 --> 00:21:18.645]  And of course, I covered yesterday, multiple congressmen
[00:21:20.734 --> 00:21:36.635]  Have come out now and called for criminal indictments against Comey, Rosenstein, McCabe and others because they've been caught in the text messages and in the memos and in the communiques saying it's political, saying it's to stop Trump.
[00:21:37.851 --> 00:21:52.443]  Saying it's to stop him in the election, then to remove him once he's president-elect, and lying to the FISA court and not telling them that it was politically motivated or where the money for the so-called investigation came from.
[00:21:52.443 --> 00:21:55.305]  That is serious fraud upon the court.
[00:21:55.305 --> 00:21:57.407]  That is serious fraud upon the American people.
[00:21:57.407 --> 00:22:05.494]  Representative Paul Gosser calls for criminal prosecution of former top FBI DOJ officials after release of Nunes' memo.
[00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:16.579]  The Republican from Arizona has a lot of courage, so we're going to be getting to that as well.
[00:22:16.579 --> 00:22:27.950]  But that said, I look at all of this news in front of me, and I wanted to just let you know some of the other news that's going to be coming up that I will cover today.
[00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:32.074]  The Islamicist behavior is sickening.
[00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:53.178]  And to watch the Islamicist wedded George Soros and the universities and the modern leftist systems and modern leftist countries and cities, and to watch them allowed to commit unspeakable crimes with wanton abandon, and to see it covered up and protected
[00:22:54.209 --> 00:23:07.089]  And then to see the parallel where illegal aliens can shoot a woman in the back, have been deported five times, and the jury virtue signals it doesn't even give the guy manslaughter.
[00:23:07.089 --> 00:23:07.670]  Think about that.
[00:23:09.164 --> 00:23:22.134]  And you see these cases constantly, you see the case coming up after the break of the Colts, Edwin Jackson, Starr, running back, reportedly killed by an illegal alien, and the media won't even say he's an illegal alien.
[00:23:22.134 --> 00:23:25.656]  The Indianapolis Starr, talk to police!
[00:23:25.656 --> 00:23:31.160]  They know the guy's name, they know how many times he was deported, they know everything.
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:34.463]  But all the rest of the media can't even get it right.
[00:23:34.463 --> 00:23:38.066]  Conservative media, the Washington Times, says he's an illegal alien from Mexico.
[00:23:38.894 --> 00:23:43.298]  No, he's from Guatemala.
[00:23:43.298 --> 00:23:52.245]  That's why I go to the local paper, because they can get there on the ground and actually check the records, not just make stuff up like national media does so many times.
[00:23:52.245 --> 00:24:00.092]  It's really incredible, but NFL.com, ESPN, Huffington Post,
[00:24:01.852 --> 00:24:04.813]  It doesn't even say that the guy was from another country.
[00:24:04.813 --> 00:24:08.474]  It says, oh, the Indianapolis man, the Indianan.
[00:24:08.474 --> 00:24:16.636]  It's like when you see an Islamist who just got in the country a month before, runs over 50 people, 100 people, 200 people, up to 300 and something they ran over.
[00:24:16.636 --> 00:24:18.917]  It was 100 and whatever killed.
[00:24:18.917 --> 00:24:21.858]  And they say, oh, the Frenchman ran them over.
[00:24:21.858 --> 00:24:24.619]  The German man ran them over.
[00:24:24.619 --> 00:24:25.539]  Yes, the German.
[00:24:27.543 --> 00:24:44.152]  Under that political correctness, if I went to China, got in a delivery truck, ran over a couple hundred people, including children, and imagine they'd say on the news, a Chinese man ran, no, it'd be a crazy American, came over to China, stole a delivery truck, and ran over a couple hundred people.
[00:24:44.152 --> 00:24:45.332]  It'd be a big novelty.
[00:24:45.332 --> 00:24:46.473]  It'd be a big story.
[00:24:46.473 --> 00:24:49.935]  You know, like when you get two weird, mentally ill Christians
[00:24:51.087 --> 00:25:01.392]  And they've got dozens of children, some 23 years old, living in feces, and it's Christians, Christians, Christians, homeschoolers, homeschoolers, homeschoolers, you're all guilty!
[00:25:01.392 --> 00:25:07.095]  Well, if Christians are all guilty, then we should at least know if it's an illegal alien or a Muslim, shouldn't we?
[00:25:07.095 --> 00:25:13.098]  But no, no, we're gonna beat it over your head!
[00:25:13.098 --> 00:25:14.778]  So here it is.
[00:25:14.778 --> 00:25:18.040]  Without even looking today, there's just stacks of this crud.
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:27.544]  Paris Massacre terrorist complains about Islamophobia, claims Muslims are mistreated.
[00:25:27.544 --> 00:25:30.346]  Paul Joseph Watson, InfoWars.com.
[00:25:30.346 --> 00:25:36.510]  Somewhere, someone is playing the world's smallest violin.
[00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:45.917]  Paris Massacre terrorist, Salah Abd Salam, the man who helped jihadists butcher hundreds of people, is now complaining about Islamophobia.
[00:25:47.042 --> 00:25:52.807]  He's on trial for the shootout he and Belgian police officers had after the November 13, 2015 attack.
[00:25:52.807 --> 00:26:03.136]  He is not expected to stand trial for his role in the Paris massacre, including 130 people who were killed and 368 that were injured in the Islamic attack, just like Vegas.
[00:26:03.136 --> 00:26:11.344]  The Belgian-born French national Moroccan descent is accused of driving the terrorists to their target locations and helping them manufacture explosives.
[00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:26.033]  The 28-year-old said Muslims were judged and treated in the worst ways, mercilessly, and said he was placing his trust in Allah before the judge, and he went on into Islamophobia and the rest of it.
[00:26:26.033 --> 00:26:27.254]  So, there you get it.
[00:26:27.254 --> 00:26:34.556]  Hey, I only helped kill 130-something people and injured 368, but you know what?
[00:26:34.556 --> 00:26:37.097]  You deserve it because you didn't kiss my ass good enough.
[00:26:37.097 --> 00:26:43.579]  And let me tell you something, that's all they do in Europe is just run around worshiping hordes of military-age men.
[00:26:44.855 --> 00:26:47.736]  I got another article here today.
[00:26:47.736 --> 00:26:59.281]  Britain is the destination for Islamists from all over the world because it has the highest welfare, the most open arms, and lets them have radical Imams calling for the overthrow of England.
[00:26:59.281 --> 00:27:01.982]  And there's quotes!
[00:27:01.982 --> 00:27:08.064]  And now British schools are saying we just may make all the kids wear burqas.
[00:27:08.064 --> 00:27:09.205]  Isn't that just darling?
[00:27:09.205 --> 00:27:09.725]  Here's another one.
[00:27:09.725 --> 00:27:13.306]  More than 5 million third world migrants entered Europe since 2011.
[00:27:13.306 --> 00:27:14.527]  Yeah, it's 10 million total.
[00:27:16.297 --> 00:27:25.583]  And it goes on, Voice of America, this is from, people say I'm Russian-controlled, sometimes I link to Russian articles, well here's Voice of America we link to, it must be run by the CIA.
[00:27:25.583 --> 00:27:32.968]  The latest figures from the European Asylum Office reveal the period between 2011-2017, 5,136,000 plus migrants have entered Europe, and they're almost all men.
[00:27:32.968 --> 00:27:33.548]  There's another one.
[00:27:40.791 --> 00:27:45.952]  German politicians alarmed at the scale of anti-christian hate attacks.
[00:27:45.952 --> 00:27:56.395]  Attacks on churches and Christian symbols accounted for a quarter of the 97 documented cases, and attacks on Christians have doubled worldwide, even according to the UN, in the last three years.
[00:27:56.395 --> 00:28:05.598]  Meanwhile, UK-based Imam performs Islamic exorcism on screaming burka-clad woman, spits on her and smashes a table on her head.
[00:28:05.598 --> 00:28:09.559]  And then there's this footage, there's this footage of
[00:28:11.132 --> 00:28:26.889]  Women's fight club that they put all over the British news like it's a great thing and it's a bunch of women screaming like toddlers and rolling around basically urinating on themselves and it's advertised as the avant-garde thing to do and they yelled about how oppressed they are and how hellish it is.
[00:28:26.889 --> 00:28:31.333]  It turns out most of them are filthy rich you know triple-barreled you know
[00:28:31.934 --> 00:28:37.756]  People worth hundreds of millions running around screaming and bitching and Paul breaks down to the real feminist star worldwide.
[00:28:37.756 --> 00:28:48.818]  We'll play that key report straight ahead and tie it into how similar it is to the Islamic woman wearing a full beekeeper suit with the worst acting I've ever seen acting like she's possessed.
[00:28:48.818 --> 00:28:50.579]  I'm not saying you can't have real possessed people.
[00:28:50.579 --> 00:28:51.059]  I've seen it.
[00:28:51.059 --> 00:28:52.419]  It looks like Linda Blair.
[00:28:52.419 --> 00:28:53.680]  This lady ain't it.
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:54.240]  We'll be back.
[00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:54.700]  Stay with us.
[00:28:59.246 --> 00:29:01.648]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell, the inventor of MyPillow.
[00:29:01.648 --> 00:29:04.249]  And like all of you out there, I have problems sleeping.
[00:29:04.249 --> 00:29:11.895]  Pillows would go flat, I would flip-flop all night long, I would wake up with a sore neck, maybe a headache, or feel like I needed a nap even though I slept eight hours.
[00:29:11.895 --> 00:29:19.940]  When I invented MyPillow, I wanted it to where you can move the patent and fill to give you the exact support you need as an individual, regardless of sleep position.
[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:24.423]  MyPillow will get you into that deep REM sleep faster and you will stay there longer.
[00:29:24.423 --> 00:29:28.906]  It's not about how much time we spend in bed, it's about how much of that quality sleep we get.

[00:31:03.662 --> 00:31:15.166]  We have found an extraordinary new natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory health, and normal breathing.
[00:31:15.166 --> 00:31:16.066]  This is pollen blood.
[00:31:17.086 --> 00:31:29.730]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs from specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like runny nose, itchy, watery eyes, and excessive mucus production.
[00:31:29.730 --> 00:31:34.052]  They began studying the effects in published trials.
[00:31:34.052 --> 00:31:38.073]  Now we are introducing the fruit of the research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet
[00:31:38.533 --> 00:31:48.642]  Just chew two tablets at the first sign of seasonal distress, and Fast-Acting Pollen Block starts working in about 15 minutes to help alleviate seasonal distress.
[00:31:48.642 --> 00:31:51.765]  Enjoy the air you breathe naturally with Fast-Acting Pollen Block.

[00:31:59.992 --> 00:32:02.054]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[00:32:02.054 --> 00:32:02.354]  Go ahead.
[00:32:03.008 --> 00:32:04.889]  Yeah, Alex, I just have to say something, man.
[00:32:04.889 --> 00:32:08.731]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[00:32:08.731 --> 00:32:10.171]  It just gets old, man.
[00:32:10.171 --> 00:32:12.593]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[00:32:12.593 --> 00:32:14.914]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[00:32:14.914 --> 00:32:18.916]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[00:32:18.916 --> 00:32:21.357]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[00:32:22.217 --> 00:32:24.538]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[00:32:24.538 --> 00:32:26.259]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[00:32:26.259 --> 00:32:27.379]  Us being shut down?
[00:32:27.379 --> 00:32:28.860]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:29.920]  You know what, Alex?
[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:31.041]  Put him on pause again.
[00:32:31.041 --> 00:32:32.141]  Hey, Frank!
[00:32:32.141 --> 00:32:37.783]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[00:32:37.783 --> 00:32:42.305]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[00:32:42.305 --> 00:32:45.446]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[00:32:45.446 --> 00:32:45.907]  You understand?
[00:32:45.907 --> 00:32:47.547]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:32:47.547 --> 00:32:48.668]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:32:49.668 --> 00:32:55.032]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the InfoWars!
[00:32:55.032 --> 00:32:55.992]  Do you understand?
[00:32:55.992 --> 00:32:57.253]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:32:57.253 --> 00:33:02.797]  Free Press needs your help, Frank!
[00:33:02.797 --> 00:33:05.439]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:32.068 --> 00:33:36.989]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[00:34:06.517 --> 00:34:23.548]  You're looking at an imam on national television.
[00:34:23.548 --> 00:34:24.769]  This is broadcast in England.
[00:34:24.769 --> 00:34:25.590]  This is very popular.
[00:34:25.590 --> 00:34:28.592]  In his little military outfit.
[00:34:28.592 --> 00:34:29.973]  With his mind control slave.
[00:34:31.345 --> 00:34:34.928]  This woman has full hoods over her head.
[00:34:34.928 --> 00:34:35.949]  We can't even see her eyes.
[00:34:35.949 --> 00:34:40.334]  And then he screams at her and spits on her and hits her.
[00:34:40.334 --> 00:34:42.736]  And it goes on and on.
[00:34:42.736 --> 00:34:46.299]  We'll come back to him spitting on her and hitting her in a moment.
[00:34:47.242 --> 00:34:52.605]  But this is the total fruitcake lunacy that is dominant Islam.
[00:34:52.605 --> 00:34:57.327]  And you can argue there's been periods in Islam where it was not like this in many areas and was actually quite productive.
[00:34:57.327 --> 00:34:59.008]  There were some golden eras.
[00:34:59.008 --> 00:35:06.152]  No, this is orthodox Islam and they argue that this is their reformation.
[00:35:06.152 --> 00:35:10.955]  Because Christianity had some issues the way it was being played out and used in the dark ages to suppress people.
[00:35:10.955 --> 00:35:14.597]  So we had a bunch of wars and other things in Europe that killed millions.
[00:35:15.626 --> 00:35:17.867]  And that then led to the Reformation.
[00:35:17.867 --> 00:35:23.568]  And there were other big wars to exterminate Protestants, and then Protestants would kill Catholics, and on and on and on.
[00:35:23.568 --> 00:35:29.850]  To what we have is the Reformed Christian Church today that you could argue is a lot more like what Jesus Christ taught.
[00:35:29.850 --> 00:35:31.911]  A lot of it's sold out in establishment as well.
[00:35:31.911 --> 00:35:40.293]  But if you go back to the Dark Ages, if they caught you gathering herbs because it would make your child not die of the bubonic plague, they would burn you at the stake.
[00:35:41.013 --> 00:35:46.236]  Because a man or a woman wasn't supposed to know any knowledge, only the people in the castle.
[00:35:46.236 --> 00:35:50.219]  And that's what Islam has turned into, is a total suppression system.
[00:35:50.219 --> 00:35:52.461]  And it needs a reformation.
[00:35:52.461 --> 00:36:05.389]  And it oppresses its main target, other Muslims, which then governments bring in by the millions and let the Muslims sit on top of as political blocs that will vote 100% as they're told by their Imams.
[00:36:05.389 --> 00:36:09.112]  That's why the authoritarian left loves them so much.
[00:36:10.157 --> 00:36:23.971]  And I was covering some of this earlier, but Paris massacre terrorist who helped reportedly kill over 130 people and injured 368 says he's upset about Islamophobia and Muslims being mistreated.
[00:36:23.971 --> 00:36:25.793]  And then it continues here.
[00:36:25.793 --> 00:36:30.497]  More than 5 million third world immigrants entered Europe since 2011, almost all Muslims.
[00:36:30.497 --> 00:36:33.841]  German politicians alarmed at scale of anti-Christian hate attacks.
[00:36:35.370 --> 00:36:43.352]  And what I just mentioned from Breitbart, UK-based imam performs Islamic exorcism on screaming burka-clad woman in Sheffield Mosque.
[00:36:43.352 --> 00:36:55.634]  And I saw this, Paul Watson, by the way, is from Sheffield in North England, he lives in London now, and it made me think of Paul's video yesterday that shows what they call Women's Fight Club.
[00:36:55.634 --> 00:36:58.035]  The video's a must-see if you're a radio listener.
[00:36:58.035 --> 00:37:04.356]  It's posted at RealAlexJones on Twitter and Prison Planet, Paul Watson's Twitter, and of course, NewsWars.com.
[00:37:05.962 --> 00:37:24.687]  And InfoWars.com and I thought that we would just preface that and then go to the video itself because the tempered tantrum screeching is much like the bizarre mental illness theatrical display we're seeing from the poor woman that you can bet your bottom dollar has had her genitals cut off.
[00:37:24.687 --> 00:37:29.889]  And so Paul in this important video breaks down what's really happening here.
[00:37:30.799 --> 00:37:34.120]  He breaks down what the real threats are here.
[00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:49.703]  And you get around these modern feminist women, they are basket cases who all come from wealthy families, pretty much, who are trying to one-up each other on who can be more bizarre, more crazy.
[00:37:49.703 --> 00:37:56.005]  And it's all about not having males around, and so it all has an extreme
[00:37:58.678 --> 00:38:00.580]  Anti-male, anti-family bent.
[00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:06.827]  Which, by the way, I have stacks of news articles here today from mainstream news documenting everything I've told you so far.
[00:38:06.827 --> 00:38:14.155]  Gender-bending chemicals found in plastic linked to breast and prostate cancer found in 86% of teenagers' bodies.
[00:38:14.155 --> 00:38:14.616]  Daily Mail.
[00:38:15.797 --> 00:38:18.578]  Not just a boy and girl, some teens identify as transgender.
[00:38:18.578 --> 00:38:20.498]  No children because of climate change.
[00:38:20.498 --> 00:38:22.679]  Some people are considering it.
[00:38:22.679 --> 00:38:23.779]  New York Times.
[00:38:23.779 --> 00:38:24.560]  See?
[00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:25.440]  That's the agenda.
[00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:27.541]  They're now admitting exactly what I told you.
[00:38:27.541 --> 00:38:29.721]  But here's Paul Watson's special report.
[00:38:29.721 --> 00:38:32.282]  We'll go to break after that and come back.
[00:38:32.282 --> 00:38:36.023]  This is a space where we can recognize that we're angry.
[00:38:55.462 --> 00:38:56.303]  Oh my god!
[00:38:56.303 --> 00:39:00.785]  We want to destroy the conservative government, we want to bring down the patriarchy.
[00:39:00.785 --> 00:39:04.927]  So the first rule of Feminist Fight Club is, talk about Feminist Fight Club!
[00:39:04.927 --> 00:39:10.009]  I mean isn't it awful how all these bigots stereotype feminists as being fat, angry, ugly misfits.
[00:39:10.009 --> 00:39:12.030]  God only knows where they get that idea from!
[00:39:12.130 --> 00:39:15.353]  Before the fight, I always think about how angry I am.
[00:39:15.353 --> 00:39:17.495]  I think about the man that catcalled me on the street.
[00:39:17.495 --> 00:39:19.257]  I'm sure you get catcalled all the time, love.
[00:39:19.257 --> 00:39:23.661]  My name is Phoebe Patey Ferguson and I founded Femme Fera.
[00:39:23.661 --> 00:39:30.847]  We fight each other as a mode of resistance to try and channel our energies and our rage.
[00:39:30.847 --> 00:39:34.911]  So you've got a triple-barrelled name and you go to a prestigious London university.
[00:39:35.011 --> 00:39:37.933]  Yeah, you don't sound very oppressed to me.
[00:39:37.933 --> 00:39:41.917]  You sound like another privileged, entitled, inherited wealth snowflake.
[00:39:41.917 --> 00:39:44.559]  Let me do a little mansplaining about real feminism.
[00:39:44.559 --> 00:39:49.083]  Real feminism is risking arrest and torture for removing your hijab in public.
[00:39:49.083 --> 00:39:53.026]  Real feminism is marching in the streets against a theocratic tyranny.
[00:39:53.026 --> 00:39:57.029]  Real feminism is strapping on a machine gun to kick some ISIS ass.
[00:39:57.029 --> 00:40:02.594]  You, rolling around in a basement in your sweaty underpants while screaming incoherently, that's not real feminism.
[00:40:03.094 --> 00:40:10.398]  When you feel, like, empowered by the numbers, actually, like, yeah, it feels like you can go out and smash them.
[00:40:10.398 --> 00:40:17.662]  Now, like, forgive me for being, like, frank, but, like, the only thing you should be smashing is the Weight Watchers' weekly meal plan.
[00:40:17.662 --> 00:40:22.505]  I have experienced, like, moments of a lot of, like, suppression and repression.
[00:40:22.505 --> 00:40:24.626]  Or not moments, but, like, a lifetime of that, actually.
[00:40:24.626 --> 00:40:27.107]  That they have been oppressed and are very oppressed.
[00:40:27.107 --> 00:40:27.747]  Really?
[00:40:27.747 --> 00:40:29.568]  A lifetime of oppression?
[00:40:29.568 --> 00:40:29.749]  You?
[00:40:30.989 --> 00:40:43.196]  Really, you, with your plummy accent and your leisure time spent painting your face while rolling around in a cellar in some upper middle class hipster enclave, let me do a little mansplaining about real oppression.
[00:40:43.196 --> 00:40:48.759]  Real oppression is having your genitals mutilated to fulfil the dictates of a backwards belief system.
[00:40:48.759 --> 00:40:51.561]  Real oppression is being subjected to constant death threats.
[00:40:51.641 --> 00:40:55.282]  It's difficult to be, like, sexy in specific spaces without being sexualized.
[00:40:55.282 --> 00:40:55.722]  F*** you Theresa May!
[00:41:23.583 --> 00:41:28.788]  Now I'm no fan of Theresa May, but if she wants to get re-elected, this sh** should be going in her campaign a**.
[00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:43.905]  So you want to fight the patriarchy by removing Britain's first female Prime Minister in two decades and replacing her with a man from a party that in its entire history of existence has never had a female leader.
[00:41:43.905 --> 00:41:51.007]  A party that organises political meetings where women are segregated to appease an actual patriarchal belief system.
[00:41:51.007 --> 00:41:52.808]  That's how you're going to bring down the patriarchy.
[00:41:52.808 --> 00:41:56.729]  Somewhere in there we hear a muddled argument about drawing attention to domestic violence.
[00:41:57.009 --> 00:42:03.955]  Even though every study shows that lesbians are statistically far more likely to be violent than heterosexual couples.
[00:42:03.955 --> 00:42:05.897]  Not that I'm saying any of them are lesbians.
[00:42:05.897 --> 00:42:14.064]  I mean, is it any wonder that just 7%, 7% of people in the UK identify as feminists?
[00:42:14.064 --> 00:42:18.668]  When even members of Vice's hardcore audience is saying it's cringey.
[00:42:18.668 --> 00:42:20.029]  Chances are it's cringey.
[00:42:20.029 --> 00:42:24.453]  How do you think the vast majority of young women are going to react when they watch this?
[00:42:25.914 --> 00:42:30.596]  If you really want to bring down the patriarchy, why aren't you encouraging women to get STEM degrees?
[00:42:30.596 --> 00:42:37.500]  If you really want to end the oppression of women, why don't you draw attention to countries in the world where women are actually being oppressed?
[00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:41.882]  Theresa May and the Tories aren't stoning women to death for violating Sharia law.
[00:42:41.882 --> 00:42:45.883]  Theresa May and the Tories aren't passing laws that legalise marital rape.
[00:42:45.883 --> 00:42:51.026]  Theresa May and the Tories aren't instructing police to round up women if their headscarves slip.
[00:42:51.526 --> 00:42:53.967]  She broke Islamic dress code.
[00:42:53.967 --> 00:42:57.528]  We live in a world where great girls are being killed.
[00:42:57.528 --> 00:43:04.351]  And this is what the... I want to tell you about an exciting new product we have available at infowarsstore.com.
[00:43:04.351 --> 00:43:09.433]  And this is basically a product that I've been taking anyway before we even launched our own version of it.
[00:43:10.053 --> 00:43:13.015]  Now the product is BODY's Whole Body Support.
[00:43:13.015 --> 00:43:18.318]  This is available right now at a massive 50% discount at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:43:18.318 --> 00:43:22.981]  It's the ultimate turmeric and inflammatory support product on the market.
[00:43:22.981 --> 00:43:31.285]  It's got the black pepper which makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system and so much more.
[00:43:31.285 --> 00:43:37.849]  Now we're not even including a lot of the benefits that this product has been scientifically proven to have.
[00:43:39.017 --> 00:43:41.059]  So I just got this fresh today.
[00:43:41.059 --> 00:43:43.341]  Literally, the seal's not even being opened on it.

[00:45:59.993 --> 00:46:05.137]  Introducing Floralife, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by InfoWars Life.
[00:46:05.137 --> 00:46:09.921]  After years of research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same.
[00:46:09.921 --> 00:46:18.588]  Floralife probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach and releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
[00:46:18.588 --> 00:46:21.971]  This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics and
[00:46:22.091 --> 00:46:27.336]  So if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet.
[00:46:27.336 --> 00:46:34.642]  Floralife supports your body's core, where you need it most, including digestion, regularity, immunity, the gut lining, and metabolism.
[00:46:34.642 --> 00:46:38.546]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?
[00:46:38.546 --> 00:46:43.290]  That's why increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[00:46:43.290 --> 00:46:46.853]  Floralife is sold as a 15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care.
[00:46:47.173 --> 00:46:51.354]  And a 50 billion probiotic for a 30 day advanced gut restoration program.
[00:46:51.354 --> 00:46:55.555]  Head to Infowarslife.com to pick up your bottle of Floralife probiotics today.
[00:46:55.555 --> 00:47:03.817]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[00:47:03.817 --> 00:47:06.518]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:17.085 --> 00:47:18.986]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:47:18.986 --> 00:47:26.809]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:26.809 --> 00:47:30.431]  It's breaking on Infowars.com just went up.
[00:47:30.431 --> 00:47:36.333]  Lawyers for General Mike Flynn to call for case to be dismissed over corruption at the FBI.
[00:47:36.333 --> 00:47:41.996]  It's known as poison of the poisonous tree and fruit of the poisonous tree.
[00:47:42.970 --> 00:47:45.971]  Because the whole thing was a fraud, it was political, it's admitted.
[00:47:45.971 --> 00:47:48.832]  They lied to the FISA court, they lied to Congress.
[00:47:48.832 --> 00:47:53.534]  The whole thing is coming crashing down and they bet everything on it.
[00:47:53.534 --> 00:48:05.199]  The plan was, and they've stated this in their own establishment publications, Atlantic Monthly, New Yorker Magazine, New York Daily News, you name it, Financial Times of London.
[00:48:06.195 --> 00:48:12.039]  The Rothschild-owned economist, they said, we're going to prove that the election was run by Russians.
[00:48:12.039 --> 00:48:23.368]  We're not just going to say that the president stole the election and that that election will be re-held, but this time overseen by a special group that Obama put into Homeland Security with an executive order.
[00:48:23.368 --> 00:48:26.550]  We're going to unseat everybody in Congress.
[00:48:26.550 --> 00:48:30.633]  Every Republican that won, there'll be a new election on that front.
[00:48:31.735 --> 00:48:36.637]  And then they said we're also going to then target Americans that are known to be promoting Russian propaganda.
[00:48:36.637 --> 00:48:52.723]  And you've seen through the year since Trump won the election, the year and four months, that they now sent out letters last week to 600 plus thousand people saying you work for Russians, you're a Russian bot.
[00:48:52.723 --> 00:48:55.724]  People got lawyers, they got folks to look at their accounts.
[00:48:55.724 --> 00:48:58.465]  Twitter had to say actually none of them are Russians, it was real stuff.
[00:48:59.346 --> 00:49:16.530]  But it didn't stop Adam Schiff from sending out letters to Congress and letters to Facebook and Twitter and YouTube and Google saying, all of this is Russian bots.
[00:49:16.530 --> 00:49:19.490]  Don't let anybody criticize the committee.
[00:49:19.490 --> 00:49:21.111]  This was just two weeks ago.
[00:49:21.111 --> 00:49:26.212]  Don't let anybody criticize the chairman on the Democrat side.
[00:49:26.212 --> 00:49:27.732]  The chairman's Nunes, but the Democratic leader.
[00:49:29.557 --> 00:49:31.338]  Or we'll say you're a Russian agent.
[00:49:31.338 --> 00:49:32.378]  There it is.
[00:49:32.378 --> 00:49:36.380]  Dianne Feinstein and Adam Schiff claim Russian bots and trolls are behind.
[00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:37.781]  Hashtag release the memo.
[00:49:37.781 --> 00:49:44.864]  And so 600 and something thousand of you that put that out, you are now suspects too.
[00:49:44.864 --> 00:49:46.705]  And I thought about the clips I played over the weekend.
[00:49:46.705 --> 00:49:49.366]  Maybe I should dig those up and play them again.
[00:49:49.366 --> 00:49:54.809]  Where they got a congressman on accusing Tucker Carlson again of being a Russian agent.
[00:49:58.012 --> 00:50:00.234]  In fact, cue that up if you can.
[00:50:00.234 --> 00:50:02.295]  It's the last minute.
[00:50:02.295 --> 00:50:09.180]  So, here is the Democrat Congressman of attache, protégé of Nancy Pelosi.
[00:50:09.180 --> 00:50:12.202]  Here is Nancy boy on there.
[00:50:12.202 --> 00:50:16.385]  And understandably, Terry Carlson doesn't usually act like he gets mad.
[00:50:16.385 --> 00:50:17.947]  If he gets mad, it's real.
[00:50:17.947 --> 00:50:23.891]  And you're getting called a Russian agent for six minutes before he's saying you're hurting America, releasing this memo undermines things.
[00:50:23.891 --> 00:50:26.293]  And then we have video coming up after it of Schiff
[00:50:27.788 --> 00:50:36.732]  On RT, three years ago, saying we need to make the whole FISA thing transparent, and it doesn't need to be political.
[00:50:36.732 --> 00:50:38.073]  So a complete turnabout.
[00:50:38.073 --> 00:50:39.053]  So that's coming up next.
[00:50:39.053 --> 00:50:41.954]  But here is a congressman.
[00:50:41.954 --> 00:50:43.735]  Again, they've told Rand Paul he's a Russian agent.
[00:50:43.735 --> 00:50:45.236]  They've said, I'm a Russian agent.
[00:50:45.236 --> 00:50:47.837]  Never any proof.
[00:50:47.837 --> 00:50:52.879]  Here it is.
[00:50:52.879 --> 00:50:54.760]  All Americans, including my children, less sick.
[00:50:56.696 --> 00:51:05.419]  You continue to support the idea that we should give suspects in criminal cases the evidence against them before we ask them any questions.
[00:51:05.419 --> 00:51:07.659]  You also believe that there's nothing wrong... I don't support that!
[00:51:07.659 --> 00:51:11.661]  I do think we should give them the benefit of the doubt as the Constitution requires us to!
[00:51:11.661 --> 00:51:12.501]  Call me a liberal!
[00:51:13.163 --> 00:51:18.085]  When have I said that I think that we should give evidence to... I'm not even sure what that means.
[00:51:18.085 --> 00:51:22.187]  By the way, I think people charged in a criminal case have the right to the evidence against them, don't they?
[00:51:22.187 --> 00:51:24.528]  Do you think... Wait, are you aware of that?
[00:51:24.528 --> 00:51:26.049]  Not when they're being questioned, Tucker.
[00:51:26.049 --> 00:51:27.990]  Yeah, Tucker, not when they're being questioned.
[00:51:27.990 --> 00:51:29.791]  Not when they're under suspicion.
[00:51:29.791 --> 00:51:30.631]  Do you think it's a problem...
[00:51:32.732 --> 00:51:44.840]  They set up a special council by Rosenstein who set up the group with McCabe and with Comey, it's all documented now, to go after the nominee, then president-elect after that.
[00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:59.890]  They're the ones that are under suspicion, but they open this blanket thing up that includes Tucker Carlson and Senator Rand Paul and Alex Jones and the president, his whole family, and now 600 plus thousand Twitter users!
[00:51:59.890 --> 00:52:00.611]  You're all under...
[00:52:02.458 --> 00:52:03.118]  Surveillance.
[00:52:03.118 --> 00:52:04.159]  You're all suspect.
[00:52:04.159 --> 00:52:07.160]  You're all being watched for the hashtags you put out.
[00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:15.403]  You're all under suspicion for working for Vladimir Putin when it's Hillary up to her eyeballs in it.
[00:52:15.403 --> 00:52:20.125]  And then now these criminal cases are going and there's no evidence there.
[00:52:20.125 --> 00:52:21.565]  There's no Russian collusion.
[00:52:21.565 --> 00:52:31.109]  So they just expand the dragnet, wanting to overthrow the country, wanting to still have this coup d'etat by special counsel.
[00:52:31.852 --> 00:52:33.193]  That's what it is.
[00:52:33.193 --> 00:52:47.161]  It's a rogue Clinton FBI special counsel coup that's politically been caught, engaged in fraud, in leaking, in perjury, in absconding, and Schiff trying to block the release of all this stuff.
[00:52:47.161 --> 00:52:56.307]  It's criminal like nothing I've ever seen, so ridiculous, so naked, so brazen, and this
[00:52:57.861 --> 00:53:00.082]  Little smart mouth, arrogant person.
[00:53:00.082 --> 00:53:01.703]  They practice acting arrogant.
[00:53:01.703 --> 00:53:04.404]  They practice fake it till you make it.
[00:53:04.404 --> 00:53:07.346]  You know these people, they're the worst.
[00:53:07.346 --> 00:53:13.249]  Representative Swalwell is jeopardizing national security.
[00:53:13.249 --> 00:53:14.850]  Says Tucker's jeopardizing it.
[00:53:14.850 --> 00:53:17.711]  And when that isn't enough to bully him, wow, you're a Russian agent.
[00:53:17.711 --> 00:53:18.312]  Let's go back to it.
[00:53:19.213 --> 00:53:27.004]  Do you think it's a problem that they were sent evidence in the Russia investigation when they are subjects of the investigation?
[00:53:28.348 --> 00:53:36.996]  Yeah, the former head of the NSA, still head of the NSA at the time, Admiral Rogers, went to the president-elect and said, sir, they did this illegally.
[00:53:36.996 --> 00:53:40.940]  And Pfizer wrote a 99-page, the court said it was illegal.
[00:53:40.940 --> 00:53:42.862]  They put a memo out about what you guys did.
[00:53:42.862 --> 00:53:49.488]  Absolutely it's good when criminal activity is going on by a rogue group in the FBI and the Justice Department to go to the president and show him.
[00:53:49.488 --> 00:53:50.169]  Absolutely.
[00:53:50.169 --> 00:53:51.630]  See, we're fighting back.
[00:53:51.630 --> 00:53:52.771]  You're not used to that, are you?
[00:53:52.771 --> 00:53:53.372]  Let's go back to it.
[00:53:54.513 --> 00:54:06.661]  No, no, maybe I would, but in the case of today's memo, what specifically have I espoused that empowers threats to our country?
[00:54:07.953 --> 00:54:17.198]  You're peddling the narrative that the Trump administration is putting out, which also is the Putin narrative, because they're retweeting this with their Russian bots.
[00:54:17.198 --> 00:54:28.584]  If you're on the same side as WikiLeaks and Putin, you should take a step back and wonder, who's bidding are you really doing?
[00:54:28.584 --> 00:54:29.624]  I don't even know what to say.
[00:54:29.624 --> 00:54:32.586]  I don't want to explode on TV, so I'm just going to end this segment now.
[00:54:32.586 --> 00:54:33.186]  I'll see you next week.
[00:54:37.244 --> 00:54:41.627]  And the reason Tucker's so mad is he knows that sack of garbage knows none of that's true.
[00:54:41.627 --> 00:54:52.655]  He's not just imputing your honor, he's part of the evil group that actually works for the Russians, or had been paid off by them and the Chinese and others.
[00:54:52.655 --> 00:54:59.120]  Now, they put out a CIA report, Democrats did, that in it mentioned that I'd been on RT before.
[00:55:00.185 --> 00:55:01.487]  So that meant I was a Russian agent.
[00:55:01.487 --> 00:55:02.088]  That's their proof.
[00:55:02.088 --> 00:55:04.811]  Well, Schiff's gone on there a whole bunch.
[00:55:04.811 --> 00:55:11.540]  This is from Schiff a few years ago on there, saying he's got problems with lack of transparency at the FISA court.
[00:55:11.540 --> 00:55:13.002]  Now he's saying the exact opposite.
[00:55:13.002 --> 00:55:15.766]  The article's on Infowars.com.
[00:55:15.766 --> 00:55:16.246]  Here's the video.
[00:55:17.011 --> 00:55:27.638]  Meanwhile on the other side of Capitol Hill in the House of Representatives, efforts continue there as well to inject more oversight into the NSA's surveillance programs and the top secret FISA court.
[00:55:27.638 --> 00:55:32.161]  One of those members of Congress leading the effort is Adam Schiff from California.
[00:55:32.161 --> 00:55:38.585]  He joined me earlier and I asked him how his reforms to the FISA court will protect America's First and Fourth Amendment rights.
[00:55:40.169 --> 00:55:55.062]  Well, I think they'll have the cumulative impact of making the FISA Court much more transparent, so the American people can understand what's being done in their name, in the name of national security, so that we can have a more informed debate over the balance between privacy and security.
[00:55:55.062 --> 00:56:02.888]  I think this can be accomplished while also maintaining sources and methods, and not compromising some of the very real national security concerns at stake.
[00:56:04.249 --> 00:56:09.710]  Yeah, that means Obama people got put in.
[00:56:09.710 --> 00:56:11.851]  Alright, that's good.
[00:56:11.851 --> 00:56:25.434]  So that's him going in and actually having Obama take over the FISA court, but saying it's for transparency and openness and to release stuff.
[00:56:25.434 --> 00:56:29.115]  Now he says don't release anything or you're a Russian agent.
[00:56:29.115 --> 00:56:30.255]  So there you go.
[00:56:30.255 --> 00:56:30.795]  Just briefly.
[00:56:31.872 --> 00:56:34.914]  When you financially support us, it makes it all possible.
[00:56:34.914 --> 00:56:35.975]  Thank you for your support.

[00:56:42.859 --> 00:56:44.260]  We have to end this special.
[00:56:44.260 --> 00:56:50.164]  What it is is DNA Force Plus, but I'm calling it Cell Force, but I think I'm gonna go back to the name DNA Force Plus.
[00:56:50.164 --> 00:57:00.231]  We had a contractual issue, but now we're authorized to use that name, but it's more the BioPQQ, more the CoQ10, more of all of it, a lot more of it, at a much lower price.
[00:57:00.771 --> 00:57:06.256]  So this is an amazing known for, again, helping the telomeres not shrink as fast, helping detoxify the cells.
[00:57:06.256 --> 00:57:07.036]  There's nothing like it.
[00:57:07.036 --> 00:57:08.437]  You and your family deserve it.

[00:58:38.556 --> 00:58:39.997]  That means it's clean.
[00:58:39.997 --> 00:58:41.118]  That means it's pure.

[00:58:53.922 --> 00:59:08.531]  Yeah, hey, listen, I just wanted to say real quick, I'm a long-time listener of InfoWars, and I just wanted to say that the t-shirts that you guys are offering are absolutely fantastic, and that really is a great way to deal with this battle in the InfoWars.
[00:59:08.531 --> 00:59:16.076]  It might seem like a simple thing, but particularly these slogan t-shirts that you guys got up right now are absolutely amazing.
[00:59:16.636 --> 00:59:27.799]  My favorite new one is the Don't Tread On Me, but instead it says Won't Tread On Me, and it's a big Dayglo snake, Gadsden snake, and then it's got the American flag, Infowars.com on the right arm.
[00:59:27.799 --> 00:59:34.041]  I mean, that's a great way just to meet like-minded people and spread the word and also exercise free speech.
[00:59:34.041 --> 00:59:36.282]  And the newest one is Trigger Warning T-shirt.
[00:59:37.202 --> 00:59:44.050]  Trigger warning t-shirt, which is the symbol of a trigger, with a yield sign and then InfoWars.com on the back.
[00:59:44.050 --> 00:59:53.321]  That is the new Shirt of the Mind, available exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:59:53.321 --> 00:59:55.944]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:09.631 --> 01:00:14.478]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:14.478 --> 01:00:21.909]  How many times must I tell you, babe?
[01:00:21.909 --> 01:00:24.213]  How many bridges I've got to cross?
[01:00:26.064 --> 01:00:28.586]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[01:00:28.586 --> 01:00:46.400]  We have a very special guest joining us in the third hour that is a national television host but also a political scientist, well a leading political scientist in Russia to give you the Russian response to what's going on in the world.
[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:55.388]  And the accelerated move towards war with Russia, one of the only failings of the Trump administration, but one that if it goes wrong could end life on this planet.
[01:00:56.937 --> 01:00:59.438]  So that should be extremely informative.
[01:00:59.438 --> 01:01:11.204]  I also intend to open the phones up to get your take on the Super Bowl behavior, on the illegal alien reportedly killing the cult's Edwin Jackson, and the media tried to cover that up.
[01:01:11.204 --> 01:01:18.088]  On gender-bending chemicals found in plastics linked to breast and prostate cancer are found in 86% of teenager bodies at high levels.
[01:01:18.088 --> 01:01:19.969]  Ooh, mainstream media reporting that.
[01:01:19.969 --> 01:01:23.471]  But first, let's go to this report, MSM Gaslights America.
[01:01:24.420 --> 01:01:34.674]  Regardless of what the Mockingbird media may have told you about the Nunes memo details, that media continues to desperately gaslight America into looking the other way.
[01:01:34.674 --> 01:01:40.542]  Alright, do you feel like you know more or less about the safety of Robert Mueller's job?
[01:01:41.602 --> 01:01:44.984]  I feel as confused as I think most Americans do right now.
[01:01:44.984 --> 01:01:51.867]  I think it feels a little bit like, you know, when you're in the supermarket and there's Muzak in the background.
[01:01:51.867 --> 01:01:55.468]  It's there, it's a constant noise, but you can't quite make out the song.
[01:01:55.468 --> 01:01:56.009]  Yeah, it's called Mu.
[01:01:56.009 --> 01:01:56.549]  Exactly.
[01:01:56.549 --> 01:02:00.611]  Hashtag release the memo was way more important than the actual memo.
[01:02:00.611 --> 01:02:03.852]  When I was reading that memo, I thought, okay, what was the big news here?
[01:02:03.852 --> 01:02:05.153]  What exactly am I reading?
[01:02:05.533 --> 01:02:09.756]  We have seen the blowing of a lot of smoke this week.
[01:02:09.756 --> 01:02:10.917]  The smoke will dissipate.
[01:02:10.917 --> 01:02:13.178]  I mean, Mueller's going to continue with his investigation.
[01:02:13.178 --> 01:02:17.721]  The goal here really isn't to find out the answers from the FBI.
[01:02:17.721 --> 01:02:25.706]  The goal here is to undermine the FBI, discredit the FBI, discredit the Mueller investigation, do the President's bidding.
[01:02:25.706 --> 01:02:33.211]  But I don't really understand how any of this is important, so I'm just going to treat this memo like every other memo I've received at work and completely ignore it.
[01:02:34.331 --> 01:02:40.593]  The President and the White House think that by saying we support the masses, the FBI, but we oppose in strong language.
[01:02:40.593 --> 01:02:45.495]  The President is talking about basically corruption at the FBI today, but we oppose the leadership.
[01:02:45.495 --> 01:02:52.378]  The workforce is going to look at this and say, this is an attack on our ability to conduct an investigation with integrity.
[01:02:52.378 --> 01:02:55.719]  There's hundreds of agents and analysts working on this investigation.
[01:02:55.719 --> 01:02:58.140]  It's not just Christopher Wray, the FBI director.
[01:02:58.140 --> 01:03:00.841]  So the FBI people, I'm going to tell you, are ticked.
[01:03:01.361 --> 01:03:07.604]  And they're gonna be saying, I guarantee it, you think you can push us off this because you can try to intimidate the director?
[01:03:07.604 --> 01:03:09.385]  You better think again, Mr. President.
[01:03:09.385 --> 01:03:10.986]  You've been around for 13 months.
[01:03:10.986 --> 01:03:11.886]  We've been around since 1908.
[01:03:11.886 --> 01:03:15.128]  I know how this game is gonna be played.
[01:03:15.128 --> 01:03:16.148]  We're gonna win.
[01:03:16.148 --> 01:03:17.949]  The memo has no impact on the Russia probe.
[01:03:19.050 --> 01:03:23.254]  Not to me it doesn't, and I was pretty integrally involved in the drafting of it.
[01:03:23.254 --> 01:03:25.657]  Rosenstein or McCabe.
[01:03:25.657 --> 01:03:31.963]  Those are the names that will be burning your ears as the truth is gradually ripped away from the spin.
[01:03:31.963 --> 01:03:40.952]  Rod Rosenstein gave the Steele dossier the DOJ's seal of approval by signing off on at least one FISA application to surveil Carter Page.
[01:03:41.212 --> 01:03:50.994]  The Daily Caller reports Bruce Ohr's wife was employed by Fusion GPS to assist in the cultivation of opposition research on Trump.
[01:03:50.994 --> 01:04:00.555]  Ohr later provided the FBI with all of his wife's opposition research paid for by the DNC and Clinton campaign via Fusion GPS.
[01:04:00.555 --> 01:04:09.497]  The Ohr's relationship with Steele and Fusion GPS was inexplicably concealed from the court when it was used to obtain a surveillance warrant.
[01:04:09.737 --> 01:04:25.668]  And Andrew McCabe, after stepping down as Deputy Director of the FBI, is now being held accountable by the FISA memo claiming that McCabe had knowledge that no surveillance warrant would have been sought from the FISC without the Steele dossier information.
[01:04:25.668 --> 01:04:34.434]  Although still secretive testimony by McCabe may refute this claim, regardless, McCabe was knee-deep in anti-Trump territory.
[01:04:34.434 --> 01:04:35.835]  Now the facts are laid bare.
[01:04:36.135 --> 01:04:40.757]  What to do with a cabal taking on the most powerful office in the land?
[01:04:40.757 --> 01:04:45.819]  All due to hubris-riddled, power-mad driven, pure partisanship.
[01:04:45.819 --> 01:04:48.201]  John Bowne reporting for InfoWars.com
[01:04:58.530 --> 01:05:02.374]  You know, I've got some talking points here about Caveman from Infowarsandlife.com.
[01:05:02.374 --> 01:05:07.099]  But instead of going on those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[01:05:07.099 --> 01:05:11.663]  From all the wives' tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[01:05:11.663 --> 01:05:14.806]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[01:05:14.806 --> 01:05:17.910]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[01:05:19.426 --> 01:05:32.249]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[01:05:32.249 --> 01:05:47.312]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.
[01:05:48.292 --> 01:05:52.575]  Find out for yourself today at Infowarsstore.com what you can do for your family.
[01:05:52.575 --> 01:05:54.316]  And again, I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:05:54.316 --> 01:05:56.577]  You are funding the information war in 2018.
[01:06:09.642 --> 01:06:10.682]  Big Brother.
[01:06:10.682 --> 01:06:12.583]  Mainstream media.
[01:06:12.583 --> 01:06:13.823]  Government cover-ups.
[01:06:13.823 --> 01:06:16.164]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:06:16.164 --> 01:06:17.824]  Well, so does he.
[01:06:17.824 --> 01:06:24.186]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:24.186 --> 01:06:29.428]  They say that imitation is the most sincere form of flattery.
[01:06:29.428 --> 01:06:36.810]  And when I imitate someone, I do it because I think they've done a great job, and I think that they've been very thought-provoking.
[01:06:37.552 --> 01:06:43.016]  And you have to understand, usually they're also imitating somebody else, and then improving on it.
[01:06:43.016 --> 01:06:54.145]  So a lot of times the crew, they'll say, well, college reform already did that, where they went out and read Trump's tax reform plan, but said it was Bernie Sanders.
[01:06:54.145 --> 01:07:02.511]  And then 99% of people said, oh, it's a wonderful, wonderful plan, when they thought it was Bernie Sanders, but really it's Trump.
[01:07:02.511 --> 01:07:07.135]  Just to show how they're dumbed down, they're biased, they're not informed, they don't know what's going on.
[01:07:08.979 --> 01:07:20.086]  And whether it's California, or whether it's New York, or whether it's areas like the University of Texas, we don't go down there to show that they're stupid to get off on.
[01:07:20.086 --> 01:07:23.568]  We do it because it's frightening.
[01:07:23.568 --> 01:07:31.993]  And you go to a conservative or libertarian era, you go to their areas,
[01:07:34.881 --> 01:07:38.204]  Half the people will actually catch on to what you're doing and be aware.
[01:07:38.204 --> 01:07:41.307]  The other half will say, hey, I'm too busy right now.
[01:07:41.307 --> 01:07:44.450]  Get that camera out of my face.
[01:07:44.450 --> 01:07:45.491]  Or, give me more information.
[01:07:45.491 --> 01:07:46.432]  What group are you with?
[01:07:46.432 --> 01:07:50.956]  Now, exactly, again, they're just canny.
[01:07:50.956 --> 01:07:53.959]  They know what's going on.
[01:07:53.959 --> 01:08:00.545]  But you go talk to liberal areas, and it's like they've been hit between the eyes with a sledgehammer.
[01:08:01.854 --> 01:08:03.774]  By the way, guys, I don't know if I asked you to do this.
[01:08:03.774 --> 01:08:04.455]  It's audio.
[01:08:04.455 --> 01:08:05.535]  He was on a radio show.
[01:08:05.535 --> 01:08:06.375]  Will you guys get this?
[01:08:06.375 --> 01:08:07.795]  Kimmel says libs.
[01:08:07.795 --> 01:08:09.756]  Excel at late night.
[01:08:09.756 --> 01:08:12.836]  Host because of a job requires intelligence.
[01:08:12.836 --> 01:08:17.397]  And we ought to play some clips of the random people at Democratic Party rallies.
[01:08:17.397 --> 01:08:24.639]  I mean, they really make you want to cry how stupid and how brainwashed they are.
[01:08:24.639 --> 01:08:29.480]  But getting back to this, college reform goes out every week and shows this.
[01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:47.926]  They'll go out and say the Bernie Sanders plan, but really it's the Trump plan, or they'll go out and say, hey, we've got State of the Union quotes from Trump, and then they say they hate it because it's Trump, but then he tells them, no, that's actually Barack Obama.
[01:08:47.926 --> 01:08:51.147]  Trump could be handing out $3,000 bills, they wouldn't want it.
[01:08:51.147 --> 01:08:58.089]  I mean, it's like Mark Dice goes out, we've done it too, we try to hand people free gold coins, and they won't take it.
[01:08:58.089 --> 01:08:58.870]  Here, here's a $1,000 gold coin.
[01:09:03.459 --> 01:09:04.300]  I'm going to give it to you.
[01:09:04.300 --> 01:09:09.363]  No, I don't want that.
[01:09:09.363 --> 01:09:12.866]  And first they'll start out, you know, I'll give you, give me $5.
[01:09:12.866 --> 01:09:19.330]  I'll give you this thousand dollar, one ounce gold coin or whatever it is at that time's cost.
[01:09:19.330 --> 01:09:22.473]  And they just shake their head because they're so ignorant.
[01:09:22.473 --> 01:09:25.335]  They don't know how to even look at a coin and see what's real or whoa, that's heavy.
[01:09:27.807 --> 01:09:28.968]  They don't know how to bite it.
[01:09:28.968 --> 01:09:30.368]  They don't know.
[01:09:30.368 --> 01:09:34.050]  They just think you're trying to give them a flying saucer or something.
[01:09:34.050 --> 01:09:34.950]  And that's really it.
[01:09:34.950 --> 01:09:36.131]  They're domesticated.
[01:09:36.131 --> 01:09:42.053]  The one thing you need to know about so-called modern leftists is they're not real classical liberals.
[01:09:42.053 --> 01:09:43.534]  They're super followers.
[01:09:43.534 --> 01:09:44.955]  They're super scared.
[01:09:44.955 --> 01:09:49.057]  They're super sheltered.
[01:09:49.057 --> 01:09:51.278]  They're unhealthy.
[01:09:51.278 --> 01:09:54.059]  And they're dumb.
[01:09:54.059 --> 01:09:56.480]  But they are crazed and want to run your life.
[01:09:58.541 --> 01:10:01.183]  They're like a pack of dangerous lemmings.
[01:10:01.183 --> 01:10:04.545]  So I'm going to get into Kimmel coming up in the next segment.
[01:10:04.545 --> 01:10:22.115]  But right now, I wanted to play College Reform, and I'm going to have one of the crew, whether it's Millie, Owen, whoever wants to go, just go back down to UT or go back down to South Congress and just sit there and, you know, say, listen to horrible, you know, Trump's State of the Union, and then give them Obama quotes.
[01:10:22.115 --> 01:10:24.577]  And just like where College Reform did this,
[01:10:25.930 --> 01:10:33.995]  When they do this in New York, it'll be exactly the same and you're like, what happened to these people?
[01:10:33.995 --> 01:10:39.758]  But the big story isn't just that when they hear it's Trump, they hate it even though it's Obama.
[01:10:39.758 --> 01:10:45.141]  Trump means it when he says these positive things about America and is doing it.
[01:10:45.141 --> 01:10:48.843]  Trump's surrogates go out and promote what Trump said at the State of the Union.
[01:10:48.843 --> 01:10:50.764]  Obama would say a lot of good stuff because he's the good cop.
[01:10:52.332 --> 01:11:01.243]  And then his surrogates go out and say America's inherently evil, America's inherently bad, America's the worst thing ever, you know, since gonorrhea, or since cancer.
[01:11:01.243 --> 01:11:08.393]  Your kids don't belong to you, Christianity's bad, veterans are bad, police are all bad.
[01:11:08.393 --> 01:11:09.174]  Demoralization!
[01:11:10.263 --> 01:11:11.523]  You can't have your churches.
[01:11:11.523 --> 01:11:13.584]  They said that at the State of the Union last week.
[01:11:13.584 --> 01:11:18.846]  You see, his surrogates do one thing, and then he comes out and says another until he is talking to Democrats.
[01:11:18.846 --> 01:11:22.247]  He's like, we'll get these better clingers, their guns, and their Bibles.
[01:11:22.247 --> 01:11:24.407]  We're going to get them domesticated and break these families up.
[01:11:24.407 --> 01:11:28.009]  And we're going to make sure they don't have cars or air conditioning.
[01:11:28.009 --> 01:11:32.290]  And by the way, you know, they think they built their businesses.
[01:11:32.290 --> 01:11:33.330]  They didn't build their businesses.
[01:11:36.542 --> 01:11:38.183]  Or the WikiLeaks, Hillary, you know.
[01:11:38.183 --> 01:11:40.365]  These damn baristas, man, these people.
[01:11:40.365 --> 01:11:41.745]  I hate my scum followers.
[01:11:41.745 --> 01:11:43.647]  They're all a bunch of slugs.
[01:11:43.647 --> 01:11:44.888]  But I guess we made them that way.
[01:11:44.888 --> 01:11:49.310]  And then the top professor who's advising her goes, ma'am, we just need to intensify.
[01:11:49.310 --> 01:11:53.253]  They're not listening to our message, but at least we can cause culture war.
[01:11:53.253 --> 01:11:55.855]  She's like, yes, send me a file on that.
[01:11:55.855 --> 01:11:57.916]  And culture war is black on white.
[01:11:57.916 --> 01:11:59.597]  And now we have their memos doing it.
[01:11:59.597 --> 01:12:04.060]  And you turn on MSNBC or CNN, I mean, that's like science fiction or something.
[01:12:04.060 --> 01:12:05.101]  Now you'd cause a race war.
[01:12:07.475 --> 01:12:13.540]  I mean, you tune into it, and it's so evil, it's so naked, it's so ridiculously obvious.
[01:12:13.540 --> 01:12:29.232]  But you gotta remember, they got those audiences slowly... ...building them up with the BS, titrating the poison until... ...the average person gets bit by a 10-foot King Cobra, they roll over and die in 5 minutes.
[01:12:29.232 --> 01:12:37.198]  But if you've been building the dose up for 20 years like a snake handler, you can get bit, you kinda get high off of it, and maybe your teeth fall out or something, but, you know, you still live.
[01:12:39.761 --> 01:12:40.602]  And it's the same thing.
[01:12:40.602 --> 01:12:59.677]  These people are like zombies because they bought into all this craziness and it just gets wackier and wackier what they're being fed to keep them on the plantation has gotten so crazy that now they're believing all this so they're like in a virtual reality totally whacked out and that's why Brian Stelter and all of them keep saying we're in a virtual reality.
[01:12:59.677 --> 01:13:07.544]  Those of us that are countering them because they know they're there holding the fort with a bubble, a force field of idiocy over what they've got left.
[01:13:09.172 --> 01:13:12.277]  Let's go ahead and go to this student's hate Trump's State of the Union.
[01:13:13.444 --> 01:13:15.205]  I'm Kenneth Phillips with Campus Reform.
[01:13:15.205 --> 01:13:19.729]  Today we're at John Jay College getting reactions to President Trump's State of the Union address last night.
[01:13:19.729 --> 01:13:23.812]  We're going to give them a few quotes from the speech and ask their reaction.
[01:13:23.812 --> 01:13:28.235]  Except the quotes we're giving them are actually from President Obama's State of the Union addresses.
[01:13:28.235 --> 01:13:29.056]  What will they have to say?
[01:13:29.056 --> 01:13:30.057]  Let's find out.
[01:13:30.057 --> 01:13:31.858]  So I have a few quotes here from the State of the Union.
[01:13:31.858 --> 01:13:34.940]  I want to get your feedback first.
[01:13:34.940 --> 01:13:41.545]  Talking about ISIS saying, quote, we need to call them what they are, killers and fanatics who have to be hunted down and destroyed.
[01:13:41.545 --> 01:13:42.186]  What's your thought on that?
[01:13:43.086 --> 01:13:45.007]  Well, first off, ISIS is fake.
[01:13:45.007 --> 01:13:49.930]  It's something the government made up so they can continue doing what they want to do, which is world domination.
[01:13:49.930 --> 01:13:55.213]  Donald Trump should, like, you know, mind his own business and, like, just focus on America because he's the president of the United States.
[01:13:55.213 --> 01:13:55.733]  Oh, I hit pause.
[01:13:55.733 --> 01:13:58.114]  We're not gonna come back and play the rest of this.
[01:13:58.114 --> 01:13:58.515]  Back it up!
[01:13:59.395 --> 01:14:12.445]  Some leftists are actually super smart and that's why I used to call myself a conservative or a liberal because the liberals had some good issues like decriminalization of drugs and then the right wing had some good things like pro-second amendment, right to life, stuff like that.
[01:14:12.445 --> 01:14:14.506]  But I didn't like the Republican bluebloods.
[01:14:14.506 --> 01:14:21.332]  That guy actually gets that ISIS was made up but by Hillary and Obama and Trump said
[01:14:22.401 --> 01:14:23.802]  Back that up 10 seconds please.
[01:14:23.802 --> 01:14:31.607]  Trump is the one that said Hillary and Obama created ISIS and turned them loose all over the Middle East and CNN promoted them as good guys.
[01:14:31.607 --> 01:14:34.389]  Remember that?
[01:14:34.389 --> 01:14:36.830]  So, he's still an anti-Trump guy.
[01:14:36.830 --> 01:14:39.332]  They come back to him.
[01:14:39.332 --> 01:14:40.653]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:14:40.653 --> 01:14:47.317]  Trump and the Russians, that's the only Russian collusion there's been, and it predates Trump, cleaned them out.
[01:14:47.317 --> 01:14:48.157]  Russians did like 90% of it.
[01:14:49.815 --> 01:14:53.903]  So, the guy gets that right, but it's Obama that did it with his cousin Odinga.
[01:14:53.903 --> 01:14:54.403]  Let's continue.
[01:14:55.836 --> 01:14:57.757]  Well, first off, ISIS is fake.
[01:14:57.757 --> 01:15:02.680]  It's something the government made up so they can continue doing what they want to do, which is world domination.
[01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:09.604]  Donald Trump should, like, you know, mind his own business and, like, just focus on America because he's the President of the United States, not of the whole world.
[01:15:09.604 --> 01:15:11.665]  I feel like that's a very strong statement.
[01:15:11.665 --> 01:15:14.927]  When you say something like that, it kind of makes you, like, a target.
[01:15:14.927 --> 01:15:19.130]  Or if you're a threat to this country, we're gonna get you for that.
[01:15:19.130 --> 01:15:20.250]  It's just ridiculous.
[01:15:20.250 --> 01:15:20.651]  Next up.
[01:15:21.791 --> 01:15:27.175]  Talking about the general world stage saying, quote, when you come after Americans, we come after you.
[01:15:27.175 --> 01:15:30.718]  It may take time, but we have long memories, and our reach has no limit.
[01:15:30.718 --> 01:15:31.839]  What's your thought on that?
[01:15:31.839 --> 01:15:36.042]  Well, I don't think that's a good way of handling something.
[01:15:36.042 --> 01:15:40.705]  It's like he doesn't think- When we come back, the exciting conclusion when they learn it's Obama.
[01:15:40.705 --> 01:15:48.170]  But see, that was just his rhetoric versus him resupplying him, giving him the weapons, creating the name, winding it all up, and that's been declassified.
[01:15:48.170 --> 01:15:49.952]  Then we'll get into Jimmy Kimmel.
[01:15:50.713 --> 01:15:54.153]  He says working Americans who aren't on welfare are stupid!
[01:15:57.498 --> 01:15:59.419]  Fully cooked, ready-to-eat bacon.
[01:15:59.419 --> 01:16:02.640]  I'm talking thick, meaty, center-cut, presidential bacon.
[01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:04.240]  Savory and delicious.
[01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:07.061]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.
[01:16:07.061 --> 01:16:07.721]  Awesome.
[01:16:07.721 --> 01:16:10.822]  No refrigeration needed with a 10-year shelf life.
[01:16:10.822 --> 01:16:12.383]  NASA PAC Technology.
[01:16:12.383 --> 01:16:13.003]  Bacon.

[01:16:17.164 --> 01:16:18.604]  Or warm and served.
[01:16:18.604 --> 01:16:20.645]  Life-saving, ready-to-eat bacon.
[01:16:20.645 --> 01:16:22.586]  10-year shelf life bacon.

[01:16:57.575 --> 01:16:59.316]  Hawaii was a wake-up call.

[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:28.821]  Hear that?
[01:17:28.821 --> 01:17:34.205]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[01:17:34.205 --> 01:17:37.107]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.

[01:19:04.232 --> 01:19:08.375]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[01:19:08.375 --> 01:19:14.639]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[01:19:16.420 --> 01:19:23.565]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.
[01:19:23.565 --> 01:19:29.429]  Alpha Power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on the market.
[01:19:29.429 --> 01:19:38.135]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms, including
[01:19:38.635 --> 01:19:39.795]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:11.461 --> 01:20:23.108]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:23.108 --> 01:20:34.916]  So they've taught the modern domesticated trendioids, I wouldn't even call them liberals, that's how we identify them in the common vernacular, semantical parlance.
[01:20:37.265 --> 01:20:39.767]  They believe they're fighting for their very existence.
[01:20:39.767 --> 01:20:45.991]  They believe they're being destroyed by thousands of big companies being incentivized to come back to the U.S.
[01:20:45.991 --> 01:20:49.174]  for colleges to actually teach curriculum that gets them a good job.
[01:20:49.174 --> 01:20:51.836]  They think having sovereignty and having free markets bad.
[01:20:51.836 --> 01:20:55.939]  They believe being victims and being part of
[01:20:57.136 --> 01:21:12.306]  Endlessly divided, balkanized, atomized, desperate, alone groups, controlled by their local factotum, their local potentate, they believe that that somehow gives them power.
[01:21:12.306 --> 01:21:16.348]  And then they're all taught everyone outside of the bubble is dumb.
[01:21:16.348 --> 01:21:21.992]  That's why Google, Twitter, Facebook, Amazon are all building bubble cities.
[01:21:21.992 --> 01:21:23.252]  They don't just look like bubbles.
[01:21:23.252 --> 01:21:25.234]  Some areas are domed bubbles.
[01:21:26.496 --> 01:21:36.543]  But dome cities where it's all connected, hundreds of structures, enclosed parks, you name it, where you're all in a community like yourself.
[01:21:36.543 --> 01:21:37.524]  They have a name for it.
[01:21:37.524 --> 01:21:43.588]  It's called a cult.
[01:21:43.588 --> 01:21:50.192]  So this is the type of dystopia many, many sociologists and psychologists say is coming.
[01:21:50.192 --> 01:21:52.234]  Of course, they're doing it in the Middle East.
[01:21:52.234 --> 01:21:54.716]  Not just from the climate, but that's what cults do.
[01:21:56.115 --> 01:22:06.239]  So, ladies and gentlemen, we get back to the campus reform video, where they hear what Obama said, but they tell them Trump said it, they're against it.
[01:22:06.239 --> 01:22:09.560]  But then when they hear that Obama said it, they suddenly like it.
[01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:12.842]  Students hate Trump's State of the Union quotes, but they're Obama's.
[01:22:12.842 --> 01:22:15.783]  And it's always the same.
[01:22:15.783 --> 01:22:21.805]  That's how Mark Dyson go up and say, we're going to put all the Jews in concentration camps for Obama.
[01:22:21.805 --> 01:22:25.467]  And almost every person signs the document on the beach in LA,
[01:22:27.216 --> 01:22:28.977]  Because if it's for Obama, you gotta do it.
[01:22:28.977 --> 01:22:31.639]  They'll do anything.
[01:22:31.639 --> 01:22:33.420]  And these are people that speak English.
[01:22:33.420 --> 01:22:38.023]  We're gonna put the gun owners in forced labor camps, and we're gonna kill some of them, okay?
[01:22:38.023 --> 01:22:40.245]  Yeah, that's a great idea.
[01:22:40.245 --> 01:22:41.946]  It's time to take these people out.
[01:22:41.946 --> 01:22:56.816]  It's like a well-spoken guy saying this, because it's all about their power, and they sit there and they watch these channels, and they really believe we are Nazis out to get them, and then their main patron, their main supplier, their main funder, their main god,
[01:22:58.709 --> 01:23:15.338]  Is a true, actual, bonafide, certified, documented, lettered, admitted, self-confessed, unapologetic, died in the wall, psychopath,
[01:23:17.807 --> 01:23:26.689]  Who spent hundreds of billions of swindled dollars trying to take over the whole world, crashed more than, what, 15 economies, bankrupted countless nations.
[01:23:26.689 --> 01:23:37.892]  When I grew up, even watching PBS when my mom was cooking dinner, I first heard about Soros as this international criminal in the late 80s trying to crash the British pound.
[01:23:37.892 --> 01:23:39.192]  I mean, back then, they were on him.
[01:23:39.192 --> 01:23:39.752]  He was a guest.
[01:23:39.752 --> 01:23:41.573]  He's like, I do not apologize.
[01:23:41.573 --> 01:23:42.613]  I'm allowed to do whatever I want.
[01:23:43.715 --> 01:23:47.896]  But then by today, it's like, how dare Alex Jones call George Soros a Nazi?
[01:23:47.896 --> 01:23:49.656]  He fought the Nazis.
[01:23:49.656 --> 01:23:51.777]  You're watching Anderson Cooper.
[01:23:51.777 --> 01:23:53.897]  Surprised they don't show him in a Captain America outfit.
[01:23:53.897 --> 01:24:00.578]  Yeah, Soros fought with Captain America and the Hulk, the incredible Hulk.
[01:24:00.578 --> 01:24:05.439]  And of course, Hulkamania, he fought with the Hulkster as well.
[01:24:05.439 --> 01:24:06.980]  They all fought Hitler.
[01:24:06.980 --> 01:24:12.341]  It was actually George Soros that climbed into the bunker with a knife in his teeth and stabbed Hitler when he was 16 years old.
[01:24:13.117 --> 01:24:14.058]  You want to die, Hitler?
[01:24:31.221 --> 01:24:34.626]  Mutated hunchback leftist weirdo likes evil.
[01:24:34.626 --> 01:24:36.248]  They like dirty things.
[01:24:36.248 --> 01:24:38.311]  Their hottest porn is torturing animals.
[01:24:38.311 --> 01:24:41.135]  I mean, you go to what the left's into, man.
[01:24:41.135 --> 01:24:42.496]  They're in denialism.
[01:24:42.496 --> 01:24:43.838]  They're not the left.
[01:24:43.838 --> 01:24:47.183]  They're a bunch of wimps living on the back of the country in bubbles.
[01:24:47.723 --> 01:25:03.679]  Who then are pissed at everybody else when they peer out from their meth haze from playing 20 hours of video games a day and they see upright strong people that aren't completely crushed by this sick culture and they think there's the enemy!
[01:25:03.679 --> 01:25:04.880]  Let's, I'm sorry, let's continue.
[01:25:06.434 --> 01:25:10.775]  He doesn't think before speaking and how how it's going to offend a lot of people.
[01:25:10.775 --> 01:25:17.337]  He should be careful because there's other countries out in the world that has like you know like automatic weapons and you know nuclear bombs.
[01:25:17.337 --> 01:25:20.658]  I mean he's got small hands so I don't know about his reach so.
[01:25:20.658 --> 01:25:26.099]  And finally talking about China saying China wants to write the rules that would put us at a disadvantage.
[01:25:26.099 --> 01:25:27.280]  Why should we let that happen?
[01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:28.220]  We should write those rules.
[01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:30.141]  I wouldn't mess with China.
[01:25:30.141 --> 01:25:33.122]  He's over the top in general, so it's par for the course.
[01:25:33.122 --> 01:25:38.064]  It's like everything is out the window, like, oh, whatever he's, oh, oh, China, China, China.
[01:25:38.064 --> 01:25:44.987]  I guess the way that he approaches things is very aggressive, and that's not the best way to approach situations.
[01:25:44.987 --> 01:25:50.029]  What if I told you that all three of these quotes were actually from President Obama's State of the Unions?
[01:25:51.710 --> 01:25:53.872]  All right.
[01:25:53.872 --> 01:25:55.033]  What's your thought?
[01:25:55.033 --> 01:25:57.094]  Are you surprised?
[01:25:57.094 --> 01:25:58.435]  Kind of, yeah.
[01:25:58.435 --> 01:25:59.956]  It's actually crazy to hear that.
[01:25:59.956 --> 01:26:03.079]  There's a bias against President Trump when it comes to hearing a speech like the State of the Union.
[01:26:04.069 --> 01:26:05.651]  Yeah, I do think there's a bias.
[01:26:05.651 --> 01:26:12.096]  I guess bias is really bad in general, just because you don't agree with it doesn't mean it's not right.
[01:26:12.096 --> 01:26:14.378]  I am definitely not a huge fan of him.
[01:26:14.378 --> 01:26:20.283]  However, I think being closed-minded is probably more dangerous than anything he could do.
[01:26:20.663 --> 01:26:34.547]  Some people are quick to, like, judge you on Donald Trump just because, um, like, a few things he say, but I think, like, if they pay attention to his whole presidency, like, maybe they'll, like, have a, like, a better, um, like, you know, outlook on him and a better, like, you know, perspective in general.
[01:26:34.547 --> 01:26:38.309]  Because unfortunately, a lot of times, what you hear is tainted by bias, and you really can't go off that.
[01:26:38.309 --> 01:26:41.210]  So, do your own research, educate yourself, it's your duty.
[01:26:41.210 --> 01:26:43.490]  It's, you know, it's the future of the country.
[01:26:43.490 --> 01:26:45.411]  That is a smart crowd compared to a lot of them.
[01:26:46.533 --> 01:26:59.381]  But when you look at the hidden Veritas camera videos and the others that have come out in the congressional hearings, they sit up there and they go, number one mission, stop Infowars and stop the president spreading his information.
[01:26:59.381 --> 01:27:02.103]  Yes, sir, we were on it at lunch.
[01:27:02.103 --> 01:27:05.005]  The heads of the companies, sir, we're on it at lunch stopping Paul Watson.
[01:27:06.479 --> 01:27:20.832]  And then last week there were all these Southern Poverty Law Center and George Soros articles from Media Matters and Right Wing Watch going, look, the last week they've had three top Facebook trending, and they've had a bunch of top Twitter, and they're like, yours!
[01:27:20.832 --> 01:27:25.116]  Some of the headlines were like, Zuckerberg's been caught again!
[01:27:26.482 --> 01:27:31.524]  Twitter's done it again, and these articles have headlines just chewing them out.
[01:27:31.524 --> 01:27:32.704]  Maybe try to pull something during the break.
[01:27:32.704 --> 01:27:35.525]  It's like Zuckerberg drops the ball.
[01:27:35.525 --> 01:27:38.926]  Zuckerberg's got some explaining to do again.
[01:27:38.926 --> 01:27:48.790]  He's openly censoring, having people arrested in Germany that don't go along with a Muslim invasion, working with Pakistan to have people arrested so they don't believe in Allah.
[01:27:48.790 --> 01:27:52.331]  He's bent over to every authoritarian regime there is on the planet.
[01:27:54.352 --> 01:27:58.393]  And they're just chewing him out, going, look what you did!
[01:27:58.393 --> 01:28:01.193]  And then Facebook's like, we'll ban him quicker!
[01:28:01.193 --> 01:28:07.634]  We will, we're sorry, we'll stop him, because they don't want me to sit here and play these clips.
[01:28:07.634 --> 01:28:09.055]  By the way, that was Campus Reform.
[01:28:09.055 --> 01:28:16.136]  They do a great job, but after they do their interview, I would then actually show the clip of Obama, because he did say those things.
[01:28:16.136 --> 01:28:18.897]  Just so you can see it for yourself.
[01:28:18.897 --> 01:28:20.057]  All right, we're going to go to break.
[01:28:20.057 --> 01:28:21.057]  We have the Kimmel clip.
[01:28:22.325 --> 01:28:24.989]  He says you're dumb, and this is so important.
[01:28:24.989 --> 01:28:27.872]  If you understand this, you understand all the angles to it.
[01:28:27.872 --> 01:28:28.112]  Because...
[01:28:30.333 --> 01:28:34.115]  When they talk about how we're in an echo chamber, they know it's the opposite.
[01:28:34.115 --> 01:28:42.040]  And they're desperately trying to keep the very, very sad people that are under their control still on their little plantation.
[01:28:42.040 --> 01:28:44.221]  I mean, you heard that one guy say it's BS.
[01:28:44.221 --> 01:28:47.143]  Obama, you know, never said we're going to take out ISIS.
[01:28:47.143 --> 01:28:48.124]  He likes ISIS.
[01:28:48.124 --> 01:28:49.724]  Well, the truth is he does like ISIS.
[01:28:49.724 --> 01:28:51.005]  He helped create them.
[01:28:51.005 --> 01:28:54.567]  But just these people just don't know what they're talking about, though.
[01:28:54.567 --> 01:28:55.028]  We'll be back.
[01:28:55.028 --> 01:28:55.448]  Stay with us.
[01:28:57.509 --> 01:28:58.410]  It's a no-brainer.
[01:28:58.410 --> 01:29:00.811]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[01:29:00.811 --> 01:29:08.957]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA, and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses, and much more, right?
[01:29:08.957 --> 01:29:10.898]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.
[01:29:10.898 --> 01:29:14.600]  Get the original, most trusted name in gravity water filtration, Big Berkey.
[01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:19.324]  And now GCN listeners receive 5% off ceramic filter systems using code GCN.
[01:29:19.324 --> 01:29:23.767]  Call or click 1-877-99-BERKEY or bigberkeywaterfilters.com.
[01:29:23.767 --> 01:29:24.267]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[01:29:27.929 --> 01:29:29.150]  Hear that?
[01:29:29.150 --> 01:29:34.532]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[01:29:34.532 --> 01:29:37.433]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[01:29:37.433 --> 01:29:41.015]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[01:29:41.015 --> 01:29:48.598]  Go to Faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles away.
[01:29:48.598 --> 01:29:53.200]  Security is a mindset, and Faketv should be part of your security solution.
[01:29:53.200 --> 01:29:55.621]  Be vigilant, but not fearful.
[01:29:55.621 --> 01:29:56.782]  Faketv.com
[01:29:58.379 --> 01:30:00.281]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:30:00.281 --> 01:30:01.523]  Go ahead.
[01:30:01.523 --> 01:30:03.465]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[01:30:03.465 --> 01:30:13.958]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[01:30:13.958 --> 01:30:17.302]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks
[01:30:17.802 --> 01:30:18.042]  Absolutely.
[01:30:40.558 --> 01:30:53.452]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[01:31:00.109 --> 01:31:18.497]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that if you want proven studies and documentation, and I can speak for hours just on the files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this, this is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[01:31:18.497 --> 01:31:24.779]  But immune wall is incredible, and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[01:31:24.779 --> 01:31:25.560]  It's a great deal at $39.
[01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:28.741]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf,
[01:31:29.381 --> 01:31:30.901]  And so much more.
[01:31:30.901 --> 01:31:32.262]  It is concentrated.
[01:31:32.262 --> 01:31:34.082]  You need to go read what is in here.
[01:31:34.082 --> 01:31:39.804]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[01:31:39.804 --> 01:31:41.024]  A citrus peel blend.
[01:31:41.024 --> 01:31:43.045]  I mean, this is the next level.
[01:31:43.045 --> 01:31:45.625]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[01:31:45.625 --> 01:31:47.066]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[01:31:47.066 --> 01:31:49.426]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[01:31:49.426 --> 01:31:50.127]  Immune Wall.
[01:31:50.127 --> 01:31:51.567]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:31:51.567 --> 01:31:52.767]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.

[01:32:37.577 --> 01:32:39.738]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:15.971 --> 01:33:18.072]  Big Brother.
[01:33:18.072 --> 01:33:20.853]  Mainstream media.
[01:33:20.853 --> 01:33:23.454]  Government cover-ups.
[01:33:23.454 --> 01:33:25.375]  You want answers?
[01:33:25.375 --> 01:33:27.255]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:27.255 --> 01:33:33.578]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:34:02.117 --> 01:34:03.757]  I am Alex Jones, your host.
[01:34:03.757 --> 01:34:09.439]  Infowars.com and Newswars.com as well as PrisonPlanet.com are our main sites.
[01:34:09.439 --> 01:34:12.219]  Thank you so much.
[01:34:12.219 --> 01:34:23.361]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to go ahead and get to some news clips here and then later I'm going to get into Jimmy Kimmel because I'm not quite ready to get into that yet.
[01:34:23.361 --> 01:34:25.142]  I was working on another story during the break.
[01:34:26.030 --> 01:34:29.191]  Stopping here a minute late and that just spoiling my mojo.
[01:34:29.191 --> 01:34:31.012]  I think I'm doing too much during these breaks.
[01:34:31.012 --> 01:34:34.274]  I think I'm going to have to stop doing work during the breaks.
[01:34:34.274 --> 01:34:41.397]  I try to multitask around here and I figured out that's what's frustrating me, that's what's derailing me, and I'm not going to do it anymore.
[01:34:41.397 --> 01:34:45.378]  If I don't have the info on something, I'm not going to wait a minute to do it once I get on here.
[01:34:45.378 --> 01:34:50.160]  I'm just psychoanalyzing what sets me off and then ruins my day.
[01:34:50.160 --> 01:34:53.482]  You know, most talk show hosts, they sit there and they
[01:34:55.117 --> 01:35:02.202]  They practice what they're going to do, they script everything, they have a bunch of guests, a bunch of clips, a bunch of news, and you're not really hearing who they are.
[01:35:02.202 --> 01:35:05.805]  You're hearing what I really think and what's going on here on this broadcast.
[01:35:05.805 --> 01:35:08.367]  There's nobody telling me what to say or what to do.
[01:35:08.367 --> 01:35:16.874]  The problem is that has its own downside because I have probably 50 articles that I actually looked at or read, a couple hundred more that I haven't even gotten to.
[01:35:16.874 --> 01:35:18.115]  They're all incredibly important.
[01:35:18.993 --> 01:35:45.431]  And I tend to get caught up obsessing over how weird and brainwashed the left is instead of just moving on and exposing the big issues and what the globalists are doing and kind of just get up above the clouds from, you know, down there in their false reality and really get up there in the halls of Elysium where the globalists see themselves operating politically as a breakaway civilization, completely separate
[01:35:46.516 --> 01:35:49.660]  From what they're up to and what they're doing.
[01:35:49.660 --> 01:35:50.581]  So that's coming up.
[01:35:50.581 --> 01:35:59.050]  But I will get into Kimmel because we have the audio now of him saying, you know, you have to be a liberal to be a talk show host because conservatives are all stupid.
[01:35:59.050 --> 01:36:05.638]  And the reason I want to get into that is it's illustrative of the overall elitist attitude.
[01:36:06.792 --> 01:36:13.974]  And it's also illustrative of how those shows have up to a hundred writers and it's all completely scripted.
[01:36:13.974 --> 01:36:23.616]  Even the pre-interviews they do with the folks that get there two, three hours before to script what they're going to talk about with the actors for six-minute segments.
[01:36:23.616 --> 01:36:35.159]  I mean, to sit there and produce something like this and then say that conservatives couldn't do that is asinine.
[01:36:37.062 --> 01:36:41.684]  That's all they've got, is their so-called elitism, and we are defeating them.
[01:36:41.684 --> 01:37:00.731]  Now, before I hit some of the other really important news here, dealing with the chemical warfare against the population and some of the other big breaking news that's on Infowars, Infowars.com, and the big announcements of how they're planning to censor the population, they've been engaged in lots of pinprick censorship
[01:37:01.601 --> 01:37:09.249]  For decades, and now they've accelerated it, hoping you become punch drunk, and when they come out with hardcore total censorship, people just accept it.
[01:37:09.249 --> 01:37:13.433]  So there's been an acclimation phase going on, and here's just one of the headlines.
[01:37:13.433 --> 01:37:20.961]  And I mention this one because it's excerpts from the Wall Street Journal, but the Wall Street Journal is behind a paywall.
[01:37:20.961 --> 01:37:22.502]  This is out of the next web.
[01:37:22.502 --> 01:37:23.824]  Hold on to your tinfoil hat.
[01:37:27.213 --> 01:37:28.653]  Hold on to your tinfoil hat.
[01:37:28.653 --> 01:37:34.855]  Alex Jones YouTube is coming for you.
[01:37:34.855 --> 01:37:37.956]  Oh, they're coming for me, but hold on to my tinfoil hat.
[01:37:37.956 --> 01:37:39.636]  I said they're coming for our free speech.
[01:37:39.636 --> 01:37:40.596]  They already are.
[01:37:40.596 --> 01:37:45.458]  And when they openly announced that I'm the number one target, that ought to tell you something.
[01:37:45.458 --> 01:37:46.218]  We're on to them.
[01:37:46.218 --> 01:37:49.258]  We're over the target.
[01:37:49.258 --> 01:37:53.980]  Even though I'm right, still hold on to the tinfoil hat.
[01:37:53.980 --> 01:37:55.300]  So we're going to be talking about that.
[01:37:57.128 --> 01:38:03.636]  And we're going to be talking about twice deported illegal drunk driver kills NFL player on Super Bowl Sunday.
[01:38:03.636 --> 01:38:05.599]  It's why we have InfoWars.
[01:38:05.599 --> 01:38:11.486]  Because I have the anatomy of the media lying and saying that he was an Indiana man and a U.S.
[01:38:11.486 --> 01:38:15.451]  citizen when he was a twice deported illegal alien.
[01:38:16.465 --> 01:38:24.253]  So we'll not just show you our article, we'll show you the anatomy of how they lied about it, then got caught, and then had to have a tiny correction.
[01:38:24.253 --> 01:38:26.475]  And then we'll show you how we boiled it all down in one article.
[01:38:26.475 --> 01:38:28.798]  Because that's how they do it, they cover it all up.
[01:38:28.798 --> 01:38:31.701]  And again, it's part of an agenda of trying to keep us dumb.
[01:38:31.701 --> 01:38:33.202]  Because if we're not genetically dumb...
[01:38:34.144 --> 01:38:44.068]  If we're not predisposed to be dumb, if nature didn't make us dumb, well, nurture, big ol' hammer upside your head of disinformation, it certainly will.
[01:38:44.068 --> 01:38:51.650]  And that is, the big brass ring here is, keep you in the dark like mushrooms and feed you Bravo Sierra.
[01:38:51.650 --> 01:38:55.452]  And I for one am completely and totally sick of it.
[01:38:55.452 --> 01:39:01.014]  So we're gonna get into Kimmel first, then into all of that absolutely important
[01:39:02.600 --> 01:39:03.703]  Information.
[01:39:03.703 --> 01:39:06.129]  Before I go any further though, it's the plug of the hour.
[01:39:07.847 --> 01:39:09.048]  You know they're out to get us.
[01:39:09.048 --> 01:39:10.349]  You know they're trying to shut us down.
[01:39:10.349 --> 01:39:16.493]  I'm going to do a tour this week, I think with a live video feed, but with lights and everything so it looks professional.
[01:39:16.493 --> 01:39:18.114]  But I want to do it live.
[01:39:18.114 --> 01:39:19.135]  Unannounced, I think, too.
[01:39:19.135 --> 01:39:32.685]  I'll just pick some time in the afternoon or the morning to march around here and then compare it to previous videos I've done over years past to the two new studios we're building, the 25-plus new people that are here, the equipment everywhere, boxes everywhere, engineers everywhere.
[01:39:33.505 --> 01:39:34.747]  You name it.
[01:39:34.747 --> 01:39:37.089]  Satellite uplinks going in.
[01:39:37.089 --> 01:39:38.050]  Whole nine yards.
[01:39:38.050 --> 01:39:39.772]  We are full attack.
[01:39:39.772 --> 01:39:41.654]  President told me, keep it up.
[01:39:41.654 --> 01:39:42.495]  Don't back down.
[01:39:42.495 --> 01:39:43.456]  Press the attack.
[01:39:43.456 --> 01:39:44.097]  We're going to win.
[01:39:44.097 --> 01:39:45.539]  I'm going to press the attack.
[01:39:45.539 --> 01:39:46.760]  I'm going to bust my ass.
[01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:48.121]  We're all going to work together.
[01:39:48.121 --> 01:39:50.244]  Men like us, we understand destiny.
[01:39:50.244 --> 01:39:50.804]  We're going to win.
[01:39:51.650 --> 01:39:52.830]  You feel the energy in the country?
[01:39:52.830 --> 01:39:54.171]  Yes, sir, Mr. President.
[01:39:54.171 --> 01:39:55.291]  I feel the energy.
[01:39:55.291 --> 01:39:57.152]  We're going to combine our energies together.
[01:39:57.152 --> 01:39:58.152]  We're going to win.
[01:39:58.152 --> 01:40:00.353]  And the energy's going to get even stronger, isn't it, Alex?
[01:40:00.353 --> 01:40:01.554]  Yes, sir, it is.
[01:40:01.554 --> 01:40:03.294]  Don't you know that scares these demons?
[01:40:03.294 --> 01:40:04.595]  They want us low energy.
[01:40:04.595 --> 01:40:07.456]  They want to break our spirit, break our will.
[01:40:07.456 --> 01:40:13.538]  It's like the Lord of the Rings analogy of grimmer, wormer, grime tongue.
[01:40:13.538 --> 01:40:17.939]  You know, in the ear of the king, got him under a spell, or, I'm too old to get up.
[01:40:17.939 --> 01:40:18.880]  I can't even walk.
[01:40:19.620 --> 01:40:21.961]  Two weeks later he's killing a thousand orcs.
[01:40:21.961 --> 01:40:23.041]  That's what's happening.
[01:40:23.041 --> 01:40:32.525]  The spell is lifting and people like Chuckie Schumer and other hunchback demons like Pelosi, they know their time is short.
[01:40:32.525 --> 01:40:38.908]  So, we've got the best books, the best videos, the best supplements, the best water filtration, the best air filtration.
[01:40:38.908 --> 01:40:47.271]  We go out and find out what is market research, the very best nutraceuticals, the very best supplements, the very best everything.
[01:40:48.581 --> 01:40:50.385]  And then we massively discounted.
[01:40:51.943 --> 01:40:53.844]  So, 25% off on BrainForce.
[01:40:53.844 --> 01:40:55.804]  Shirt of the month, get 20% off.
[01:40:55.804 --> 01:40:58.285]  You can cancel anytime, a new shirt comes every month.
[01:40:58.285 --> 01:41:01.266]  And we've got a limited time sale on CellForce.
[01:41:01.266 --> 01:41:03.166]  It's about to end, it's about to sell out.
[01:41:03.166 --> 01:41:04.746]  I didn't want to step on Dr. Grip's toes.
[01:41:04.746 --> 01:41:10.508]  We got even stronger by OPQQ, CoQ10, by going to the big top organic national manufacturer.
[01:41:10.508 --> 01:41:11.968]  Grip said, hey, I'm impressed you did this.
[01:41:11.968 --> 01:41:16.490]  No need to, you know, call it CellForce because it's confusing people.
[01:41:16.490 --> 01:41:19.971]  We'll just discontinue DNAForce and call this DNAForce Plus.
[01:41:19.971 --> 01:41:21.291]  So, that's what's happened.
[01:41:21.491 --> 01:41:24.212]  Highest quality bio PQQ, CoQ10.
[01:41:24.212 --> 01:41:25.493]  He's making five new products for us.
[01:41:25.493 --> 01:41:27.394]  It's a great job.
[01:41:27.394 --> 01:41:33.236]  But we went out to the biggest organic company out there and we got this set up.
[01:41:33.236 --> 01:41:37.738]  So at medical facilities, other places, they sell us for 200, 300, 400 bucks.
[01:41:37.738 --> 01:41:40.299]  They put a 7, 8, 9, 10 markup on it.
[01:41:40.299 --> 01:41:44.981]  Cause it is, before it was like 55, 60 bucks putting on the run in each bottle.
[01:41:44.981 --> 01:41:46.682]  Well, now it's 30 bucks in each bottle.
[01:41:47.162 --> 01:41:49.344]  And then we sell it for $69.95.
[01:41:49.344 --> 01:41:50.725]  That's over 100% markup.
[01:41:50.725 --> 01:41:51.866]  Helps fund our operation.
[01:41:51.866 --> 01:41:57.290]  It's just no one gets true Bio PQQ and CoQ10 at a price like this.
[01:41:57.290 --> 01:42:06.497]  Synthetic crud that you can't even absorb, that's way lower in dosage, is $50, $60 for little bitty plastic bottles and Whole Foods and everywhere.
[01:42:08.308 --> 01:42:11.131]  I'm getting ready to go in there and do a side-by-side comparison and show everybody.
[01:42:11.131 --> 01:42:13.774]  That's owned by Bezos now, so of course he's screwing you.
[01:42:13.774 --> 01:42:14.474]  Not us, man.
[01:42:14.474 --> 01:42:18.218]  We bring you pharmaceutical, nutraceutical grade.
[01:42:18.218 --> 01:42:19.039]  It's a great deal at $100.
[01:42:19.039 --> 01:42:23.143]  And if you want to buy it at that price and help fund the operation, that's great.
[01:42:23.143 --> 01:42:25.625]  You're already getting the best deal.
[01:42:25.625 --> 01:42:27.908]  At $69, it's going to be called DNA Force Plus.
[01:42:29.099 --> 01:42:30.680]  It's CellForce right now.
[01:42:30.680 --> 01:42:39.544]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, the ultimate antioxidant, the ultimate for your telomeres, the ultimate for your... inside your cells to get the toxins out.
[01:42:39.544 --> 01:42:41.485]  CellForce, CellForce, CellForce.
[01:42:41.485 --> 01:42:46.247]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:42:46.247 --> 01:42:47.628]  It's about to sell out.
[01:42:47.628 --> 01:42:55.131]  In a few months, we'll have DNA Force Plus in the very same pill under a new, more powerful name.
[01:42:55.131 --> 01:42:56.532]  Thank you for funding our operation.
[01:42:58.009 --> 01:42:59.450]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[01:42:59.450 --> 01:43:00.750]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:43:00.750 --> 01:43:01.971]  Why is this so good?
[01:43:01.971 --> 01:43:07.253]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:43:07.253 --> 01:43:20.798]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:43:20.798 --> 01:43:22.159]  Right now with all the refugees,
[01:43:22.939 --> 01:43:24.579]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[01:43:24.579 --> 01:43:27.160]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:43:27.160 --> 01:43:28.460]  These are all parasites.
[01:43:28.460 --> 01:43:29.560]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[01:43:29.560 --> 01:43:30.901]  There's so many things that are in it.
[01:43:30.901 --> 01:43:35.401]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:43:35.401 --> 01:43:38.682]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:43:38.682 --> 01:43:41.743]  Alright, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:43:41.743 --> 01:43:42.803]  It just came back in yesterday.
[01:43:42.803 --> 01:43:43.623]  Living Defense.
[01:43:43.623 --> 01:43:44.723]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:43:44.723 --> 01:43:45.743]  And folks, you can't lose.

[01:43:48.464 --> 01:43:48.564]  And...
[01:43:49.344 --> 01:43:50.365]  You support the broadcast.
[01:43:50.365 --> 01:43:51.707]  Infowarslives.com.
[01:43:51.707 --> 01:43:53.949]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[01:43:53.949 --> 01:43:55.912]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:43:57.421 --> 01:43:59.402]  Michael ZX is back!
[01:43:59.402 --> 01:44:06.305]  And just like we're game-changing when it comes to politics, when it comes to the economy, we're game-changing on supplements.

[01:44:22.873 --> 01:44:31.755]  You say a fungus is a scourge, mold's a scourge, and you can't battle it with this in your sinus or other areas, but in your gut, the main area, you can.
[01:44:31.755 --> 01:44:34.115]  MycoZX, available exclusively.

[01:44:58.050 --> 01:45:01.471]  Introducing CellForce by InfoWars Life.
[01:45:01.471 --> 01:45:05.433]  CellForce focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[01:45:05.433 --> 01:45:08.774]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[01:45:08.774 --> 01:45:11.314]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[01:45:11.314 --> 01:45:15.676]  CellForce helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[01:45:16.036 --> 01:45:18.379]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul.
[01:45:18.379 --> 01:45:25.429]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[01:45:25.429 --> 01:45:32.578]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[01:45:33.579 --> 01:45:38.643]  The antioxidants found in CellForce are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[01:45:38.643 --> 01:45:46.289]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[01:45:46.289 --> 01:45:51.192]  Boost, protect and adapt with CellForce from InfoWars Life.
[01:45:51.192 --> 01:45:54.114]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:45:57.637 --> 01:46:09.749]  Top scientists and researchers agree we are being hit by toxic weapons in the food and water supply that are making us fat, sick, and stupid.
[01:46:09.749 --> 01:46:11.130]  So what do we do about it?
[01:46:11.130 --> 01:46:14.473]  Well, for starters, don't just sit there and take it.
[01:46:14.473 --> 01:46:20.539]  Fight back with the all-new supercharged BrainForce Plus and feel the rush
[01:46:20.939 --> 01:46:22.201]  Without the crash.
[01:46:22.201 --> 01:46:28.448]  RainForce Plus is the next generation of advanced neural activation and nootropics.
[01:46:28.448 --> 01:46:36.358]  And now we've added a brand new ingredient called Black Pepper Fruit Extract that gives you an added kick.
[01:46:37.198 --> 01:46:49.927]  Other ingredients include vitamin B12 and neurological tonic and cognitive enhancers that will allow you to flip the switch and supercharge your state of mind.
[01:46:49.927 --> 01:46:51.248]  It's the real deal.
[01:46:51.248 --> 01:46:52.989]  Brain Force Plus.
[01:46:52.989 --> 01:47:01.094]  Secure your bottle right now at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:47:01.094 --> 01:47:03.756]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:20.922 --> 01:47:26.564]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:47:26.564 --> 01:47:30.606]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:47:30.606 --> 01:47:47.132]  Trump is in Ohio right now at a big heating and cooling factory for home use appliances and where they are expanding the factory and bringing more of their production back to the United States from overseas.
[01:47:47.132 --> 01:47:48.833]  I just saw some images of Trump
[01:47:50.882 --> 01:47:58.505]  Piling off out of Air Force One and making his way there.
[01:47:58.505 --> 01:48:02.346]  But right now let's go ahead and go to another report.
[01:48:02.346 --> 01:48:13.630]  Let's go ahead and go to the Deep State is on its knees and then I'll come back and I'll go to the Jimmy Kimmel report saying that you're stupid and then I'll get into the other news that I
[01:48:14.483 --> 01:48:21.285]  I have here twice deported illegal drunk driver kills NFL player on Super Bowl Sunday.
[01:48:21.285 --> 01:48:22.926]  Let's go ahead though and get into this report.
[01:48:22.926 --> 01:48:24.626]  I want to remind folks this is happening.
[01:48:24.626 --> 01:48:26.066]  The deep state is on its knees.
[01:48:26.066 --> 01:48:27.087]  Here it is.
[01:48:27.087 --> 01:48:38.090]  We got a lot more we're going to give to Congress that will dwarf this if the Democrats and the globalists and the corrupt people at the top of the FBI don't roll over.
[01:48:39.747 --> 01:48:49.774]  If you don't roll over, and if you keep having this war to try to stop the recovery and all the rest of it, we got everything on you, Jack, just like our military source, Zach, was saying.
[01:48:49.774 --> 01:48:51.295]  There's two factions in the United States.
[01:48:51.295 --> 01:48:57.860]  There's legitimate government that's being ran by the White House right now, restoring the American Republic and the second American Revolution.
[01:48:57.860 --> 01:48:59.922]  And then there's the deep state, the generational
[01:49:02.203 --> 01:49:08.487]  You know, just toxic poison that's been in the White House and been in our intelligence agencies for 20, 30, 40, 50 years.
[01:49:08.487 --> 01:49:18.434]  And literally the Donald Trump administration is combating that in patriots and generals and people within the military and within the private sector have been waiting for this.
[01:49:18.434 --> 01:49:24.218]  We needed to actually have the capability of doing this and Donald Trump has given us that opportunity to do this.
[01:49:24.218 --> 01:49:26.899]  They got everything, all of it.
[01:49:26.899 --> 01:49:28.781]  And if you want to play hardball, let's do it.
[01:49:29.730 --> 01:49:32.352]  Soros and all of you, just keep pushing.
[01:49:32.352 --> 01:49:33.332]  No one stood up to you.
[01:49:33.332 --> 01:49:36.014]  You had a Republican leadership that you were in bed with before.
[01:49:36.014 --> 01:49:42.257]  You're facing opposition that now has the presidency, most of the states, and most of the courts.
[01:49:42.257 --> 01:49:44.719]  You will be defeated.
[01:49:44.719 --> 01:49:50.222]  Only a nuke attack, taking out the president and the Republican leadership, like they could have done at that West Virginia India event.
[01:49:50.822 --> 01:49:53.883]  With the whole situation, I mean, they shouldn't all be in one place at one time.
[01:49:53.883 --> 01:49:55.043]  I don't think that's smart.
[01:49:55.043 --> 01:49:56.844]  Unless the Democrats are there as well.
[01:49:56.844 --> 01:49:59.124]  And they still might wipe out their own people in a sacrifice.
[01:49:59.124 --> 01:50:02.525]  I mean, these are serious people we're up against, okay?
[01:50:02.525 --> 01:50:12.908]  I continue to be much more concerned when it comes to our security with the prospect of a nuclear weapon going off in Manhattan.
[01:50:12.908 --> 01:50:14.789]  It is exactly what we knew it would be.
[01:50:15.822 --> 01:50:25.936]  It is a codified indictment of the compendium of what we know with the Democrats organizing this fraud to stop Trump from becoming president.
[01:50:25.936 --> 01:50:30.822]  And then once he was elected to try to remove him from the presidency, a classic conspiracy.
[01:50:30.822 --> 01:50:32.344]  And we have their text messages.
[01:50:32.344 --> 01:50:33.105]  We have witnesses.
[01:50:33.105 --> 01:50:33.706]  We have all of it.
[01:50:33.986 --> 01:50:44.490]  One can go back to November 17th of 2016, when Admiral Mike Rogers, head of the NSA, broke ranks, made an unscheduled visit to Trump Tower.
[01:50:44.490 --> 01:50:45.810]  You've covered this.
[01:50:45.810 --> 01:51:03.116]  Met with Donald Trump, and in that meeting, we don't know, of course, what he said, but certainly the effects of what he said were clear, because the next day, Donald Trump moved from Trump Tower, again, as President-elect, to the golf course in Bedminster, New Jersey.
[01:51:03.737 --> 01:51:05.581]  Because of what Mike Rogers said.
[01:51:05.581 --> 01:51:11.314]  And basically, what Rogers said, and I'm speculating here, is the fact that, hey, a brother... Again, he didn't give a heads up!
[01:51:11.314 --> 01:51:12.738]  He went there to report the treason!
[01:51:13.864 --> 01:51:14.364]  That's right.
[01:51:14.364 --> 01:51:23.406]  And then right after that, of course, you saw Clapper and others calling for Rogers to be fired because of breaking ranks.
[01:51:23.406 --> 01:51:38.730]  But all the roads lead right back to Obama, as well as the parallel roads lead back to Clinton, because with Hillary Clinton as well, I just have to mention this, Hillary Clinton,
[01:51:39.630 --> 01:51:51.400]  Using a private server set up Barack Hussein Obama in the White House communicated from Russian soil on a private server to Hillary Clinton while she was in Russia.
[01:51:51.400 --> 01:51:54.523]  You're not seeing anywhere in the media as usual what this is.
[01:51:54.523 --> 01:52:00.387]  It's a threat from the president to them that we have you by the short hairs, you better back off right now.
[01:52:00.387 --> 01:52:05.852]  And we've caught you in perjury in Congress and to the FISA court and I keep repeating this because it's bombshell.
[01:52:08.692 --> 01:52:12.333]  All roads on illegal spying lead to Obama.
[01:52:12.333 --> 01:52:13.714]  And we know that.
[01:52:13.714 --> 01:52:18.236]  And we know it's blacked out in the FISA warrant request.
[01:52:18.236 --> 01:52:24.458]  And the fact that they've been stonewalling on this is going to blow up in their face so incredibly bad.
[01:52:24.458 --> 01:52:30.780]  By the way, the biggest thing that I've been intending to say in the last week here on air I haven't gotten around to.
[01:52:30.780 --> 01:52:32.341]  But so I have time to do it.
[01:52:32.341 --> 01:52:35.422]  I'm going to do it at six after in the third hour.
[01:52:37.228 --> 01:52:59.213]  I have had, I'm gonna tell some of these stories, prominent Democrats that I know, prominent liberals that I've known for many years, come up to me and apologize and say, wow, Trump really got spied on illegally and people need to go to jail for this and this is scary.
[01:52:59.213 --> 01:53:05.214]  And some of these people are pretty high up in the Democratic Party in Texas, and they just didn't believe any of this stuff was going on.
[01:53:06.124 --> 01:53:17.371]  And they're now coming to me and calling me, and I had lunch Saturday with a couple of them, and they are not laughing anymore.
[01:53:17.371 --> 01:53:26.397]  And some of them are prominent lawyers, others have been in government, and they're more Dixiecrat-type guys, and they are really freaked out at this point.
[01:53:27.051 --> 01:53:38.488]  So, the sinking ship is sinking, and people that weren't rats, but people that thought, you know, that I was exaggerating, they're now really starting to get religion.
[01:53:38.488 --> 01:53:41.152]  Now let's look at the curious case of Jimmy Kimmel.
[01:53:42.085 --> 01:53:44.126]  Jimmy Kimmel wants to host the Man Show.
[01:53:44.126 --> 01:53:45.567]  I know people that are friends with Kimmel.
[01:53:45.567 --> 01:53:49.048]  They told me years ago that Kimmel's a listener and likes the show.
[01:53:49.048 --> 01:53:51.029]  He's done friendly skits making fun of me.
[01:53:51.029 --> 01:54:04.395]  He's also done some threatening skits, you know, that I still thought were a joke, but in hindsight, I don't think are now that he admits he gets advised by Chuckie Schumer every day he's on air and by other Democratic leaders with talking points.
[01:54:04.395 --> 01:54:07.156]  So when he says, hey, imagine from the New World Order, we're going to kill you.
[01:54:07.156 --> 01:54:10.317]  And, you know, then he simulates shooting me with a gun.
[01:54:10.317 --> 01:54:11.178]  I take it serious.
[01:54:12.555 --> 01:54:15.356]  And now, Kimmel's gotten really, really nasty.
[01:54:15.356 --> 01:54:16.617]  And he was on a talk show.
[01:54:16.617 --> 01:54:19.979]  We're going to play a clip of it here.
[01:54:19.979 --> 01:54:28.062]  And he basically said that libs excel at late-night hosts because a job requires intelligence.
[01:54:28.062 --> 01:54:29.043]  Well, here's the problem.
[01:54:30.239 --> 01:54:33.361]  You have an army of writers.
[01:54:33.361 --> 01:54:37.343]  Some of the shows have upwards of 100, normally about 15 full-time writers.
[01:54:37.343 --> 01:54:38.464]  You can look it up.
[01:54:38.464 --> 01:54:39.625]  Kimmel's no different.
[01:54:39.625 --> 01:54:44.748]  They get up there, they read off a teleprompter and their monologue, most of it written by somebody else.
[01:54:44.748 --> 01:54:47.570]  They've got applause lights, they've got someone telling people to applause.
[01:54:49.304 --> 01:54:49.844]  It's scripted.
[01:54:49.844 --> 01:54:58.291]  They script the interviews with the guests that come to a great extent, on the phone with producers days before, then for hours off and on beforehand.
[01:54:58.291 --> 01:55:03.495]  I mean, I've been with friends out in Los Angeles and gone along to tapings of stuff with Leno, you name it.
[01:55:03.495 --> 01:55:07.137]  And Leno's more of a libertarian, and he's come out and said it's nasty, it's wrong.
[01:55:07.137 --> 01:55:10.340]  He had double the ratings of people like Kimmel when they got rid of him.
[01:55:10.340 --> 01:55:12.281]  But he wouldn't get nasty.
[01:55:12.281 --> 01:55:14.343]  And he's come out and talked about that.
[01:55:14.343 --> 01:55:16.804]  So Kimmel is a mercenary teleprompter reader.
[01:55:17.745 --> 01:55:25.547]  And it's a classic leftist statement that there's no conservative talk show host on late night TV because they're too stupid.
[01:55:25.547 --> 01:55:33.588]  We've had lots of conservatives with hit TV shows and hit late night programs and hit you name it and they get knocked off because they won't play ball.
[01:55:33.588 --> 01:55:34.589]  That's admitted.
[01:55:34.589 --> 01:55:39.130]  Hollywood won't tolerate Taylor Swift because she won't come out and attack Trump.
[01:55:39.130 --> 01:55:41.290]  She's just neutral.
[01:55:41.290 --> 01:55:43.350]  So that statement is unbelievable.
[01:55:43.350 --> 01:55:45.991]  You are a part of a cult monopoly.
[01:55:47.025 --> 01:55:53.310]  Mr. Kemmel, you are part of a group that bullies anything that doesn't agree with its worldview.
[01:55:53.310 --> 01:55:58.253]  And you're trying to bully the rest of the country, and you're getting your ass politically handed to you.
[01:55:58.253 --> 01:56:10.142]  So, you just keep your nose up in the air as an arrogant SOB, and you sit there and get your talking points from a slob, a schmuck, like Chuckie Schumer, and you just keep dreaming.
[01:56:10.142 --> 01:56:13.784]  Because America is awake to all you elitist scumbags.
[01:56:13.784 --> 01:56:14.205]  Here he is.
[01:56:15.282 --> 01:56:24.649]  It also just so happens that pretty much every late night talk show host is a liberal.
[01:56:24.649 --> 01:56:25.610]  Go figure.
[01:56:25.610 --> 01:56:30.233]  And that's because it requires a measure of intelligence.
[01:56:30.233 --> 01:56:38.379]  Now, not a ton.
[01:56:38.379 --> 01:56:40.260]  Not a tremendous amount of intelligence.
[01:56:41.917 --> 01:56:43.718]  You do have to be over the baseline.
[01:56:43.718 --> 01:56:51.062]  Sir, sir.
[01:56:51.062 --> 01:57:02.088]  So there you hear him on a podcast with, I guess, some audio to his audience they didn't release because they have hours and hours of taping before they cut it up and put their program out.
[01:57:02.088 --> 01:57:03.869]  It's called Pod Save America.
[01:57:03.869 --> 01:57:06.850]  So that's their attitude.
[01:57:06.850 --> 01:57:08.851]  That's their worldview.
[01:57:08.851 --> 01:57:09.912]  That's what they think of you.
[01:57:10.771 --> 01:57:18.601]  And just like leftist media when an illegal alien runs over and kills NFL starting linebacker for the Colts.
[01:57:19.864 --> 01:57:24.348]  The media doesn't tell you he's an illegal alien until you go to the local police report in Indianapolis.
[01:57:24.348 --> 01:57:26.089]  That's where you find it out.
[01:57:26.089 --> 01:57:31.713]  Because, again, they think we're dumb and so they think they can lie to us like Gruber with the whole Obamacare scam.
[01:57:31.713 --> 01:57:35.496]  He said, thank God Americans have no attention span or so dumb.
[01:57:35.496 --> 01:57:36.197]  Well, you know what?
[01:57:36.197 --> 01:57:39.880]  We're smart enough to know you're a slime bag selling us out.
[01:57:39.880 --> 01:57:41.641]  And he'd been deported twice.
[01:57:41.641 --> 01:57:43.102]  We'll be back with hour number three.
[01:57:43.102 --> 01:57:43.523]  Stay with us.
[01:57:47.589 --> 01:57:51.073]  InfoWars Live is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[01:57:51.073 --> 01:58:02.587]  We have found extraordinary new natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory health and normal breathing.
[01:58:02.587 --> 01:58:03.508]  This is pollen blood.
[01:58:04.489 --> 01:58:17.155]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs from specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like runny nose, itchy watery eyes, and excessive mucus production.
[01:58:17.155 --> 01:58:21.477]  They began studying the effects in published trials.
[01:58:21.477 --> 01:58:25.479]  Now we are introducing the fruit of the research, a fast-acting chewable tablet.
[01:58:25.939 --> 01:58:36.050]  Just two, two tablets at the first sign of seasonal distress and Fast-Acting Pollen Block starts working in about 15 minutes to help alleviate seasonal distress.
[01:58:36.050 --> 01:58:39.174]  Enjoy the air you breathe naturally with Fast-Acting Pollen Block.

[01:58:48.801 --> 01:58:53.964]  Introducing Floralife, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by InfoWars Life.
[01:58:53.964 --> 01:58:58.727]  After years of research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same.
[01:58:58.727 --> 01:59:07.412]  Floralife probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach and releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
[01:59:07.412 --> 01:59:10.654]  This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics
[01:59:10.914 --> 01:59:16.159]  So if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet.
[01:59:16.159 --> 01:59:23.466]  Floralife supports your body's core, where you need it most, including digestion, regularity, immunity, the gut lining, and metabolism.
[01:59:23.466 --> 01:59:27.390]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?
[01:59:27.390 --> 01:59:32.114]  That's why increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[01:59:32.114 --> 01:59:35.678]  Floralife is sold as a $15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care.
[01:59:36.118 --> 01:59:37.599]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:07.461 --> 02:00:12.346]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:00:12.346 --> 02:00:13.867]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:13.867 --> 02:00:24.258]  It's gotta be clear.
[02:00:25.767 --> 02:00:31.731]  They taped this podcast that we were just mentioning that Jimmy Kimmel was at in front of a studio audience.
[02:00:31.731 --> 02:00:41.958]  Where I guess he works on the comedy he's going to go out and use against the general public with all the ideas that Chuckie Schumer gives him.
[02:00:41.958 --> 02:00:50.783]  But that said, this is what these people think of you when they call you flyover country and better clingers and all the rest of it.
[02:00:50.783 --> 02:00:54.546]  And what a cloistered, sheltered dunce he is.
[02:00:56.365 --> 02:01:07.229]  That they got rid of all these people because they wouldn't be nasty in their comedy, including Conan O'Brien, who still goes and pulls stunts now, trying to get back in the good graces of the globalists.
[02:01:07.229 --> 02:01:09.610]  But he had a contract dispute.
[02:01:09.610 --> 02:01:15.392]  But especially Jay Leno, who had way higher ratings than these guys, and they got rid of him.
[02:01:15.392 --> 02:01:21.995]  Leno's talked about it because he wouldn't get nasty on either political party.
[02:01:21.995 --> 02:01:24.676]  But now that's part of this radicalization process.
[02:01:25.822 --> 02:01:32.445]  Show Extremism and Defensive Liberties, No Vice, to quote the late, great Barry Goldwater.
[02:01:32.445 --> 02:01:39.628]  But I saw a clip I wanted to play, and I noticed the clip in the article in the Daily Caller for some reason didn't give it credit, but I thought, I know that guy!
[02:01:39.628 --> 02:01:50.473]  I think I was on Mankal's show with him in studio once, and I was amazed, because I remember the name, all the imitations he could do, and then I could never remember the name wanting to get him on myself.
[02:01:50.473 --> 02:01:54.975]  So when Matt, one of the producers, was showing me this clip, I thought, man, I know that guy, I want to get him on.
[02:01:56.184 --> 02:02:09.468]  It's John DeMonaco, best Trump impersonation yet, local DC commercial, features fake Donald Trump, Cyprus air heating, cooling, and fireplaces.
[02:02:09.468 --> 02:02:14.330]  And again, you can make fun of somebody and it's fun, and it doesn't have to be nasty.
[02:02:14.330 --> 02:02:16.691]  That's why I love it when they make fun of me.
[02:02:16.691 --> 02:02:19.792]  They figured this out with the Super Deluxe channel that
[02:02:22.230 --> 02:02:27.535]  Time Warner has all, it's like their top five videos ever last time I checked are me.
[02:02:27.535 --> 02:02:30.818]  We're talking 10 million, 20 million, 16 million.
[02:02:30.818 --> 02:02:33.921]  Their other average videos have a couple hundred thousand views.
[02:02:33.921 --> 02:02:37.445]  And I'm talking about Facebook where they have like 20 something million on one of my videos.
[02:02:37.905 --> 02:02:47.537]  But the point is that as soon as I said I loved it and it brought us all these new fans, they messed with the audio and screwed it up and took it offline for a while.
[02:02:47.537 --> 02:02:54.045]  So it just shows how the establishment doesn't know how this stuff boomerangs back in their face.
[02:02:54.045 --> 02:02:54.666]  So I love it.
[02:02:54.666 --> 02:02:55.847]  Keep trolling, keep attacking.
[02:02:56.788 --> 02:03:09.913]  You know, my children, not just at their private school, but when they go for sports at the local public school, and I'm not bragging, it's just a bellwether, everybody goes crazy like a rock star arrived, and everybody runs up saying, I want a photo with Meme Man.
[02:03:09.913 --> 02:03:18.856]  And a lot of them are politically awake now because of the Meme Man, because I'm known as the Meme Man, I guess I'm the second biggest meme only after Trump.
[02:03:18.856 --> 02:03:22.197]  Because most people have like one big meme or something, but then it goes away.
[02:03:22.197 --> 02:03:24.898]  Now we are thousands of memes, legions of memes.
[02:03:25.819 --> 02:03:26.340]  Enough of that.
[02:03:26.340 --> 02:03:31.795]  Let's just go to John DeMonaco, who I think is a lot better than a lot of these Trump impersonators.
[02:03:31.795 --> 02:03:32.898]  He's certainly better than Alec Baldwin.
[02:03:32.898 --> 02:03:33.158]  Here it is.
[02:03:33.925 --> 02:03:39.647]  Melania did not kick me out of the White House for installing coal-burning fireplaces.
[02:03:39.647 --> 02:03:41.647]  Fake news!
[02:03:41.647 --> 02:03:42.988]  Mr. President!
[02:03:42.988 --> 02:03:46.569]  Why are you throwing balls at my face, Kirk Cousins?
[02:03:46.569 --> 02:03:47.489]  It's Kirk.
[02:03:47.489 --> 02:03:48.989]  That's what I said, Gerd.
[02:03:48.989 --> 02:03:49.649]  Never mind.
[02:03:49.649 --> 02:03:50.590]  I just saw your tweet.
[02:03:50.590 --> 02:03:51.610]  You look pretty upset.
[02:03:51.610 --> 02:03:54.011]  Well, you read my defense perfectly.
[02:03:54.011 --> 02:04:00.452]  Melania says these old-school fireplaces are dirty, and I'm turning the White House into an ash hole.
[02:04:00.452 --> 02:04:01.813]  Forget the mess, Mr. President.
[02:04:01.813 --> 02:04:02.413]  Just come with me.
[02:04:03.464 --> 02:04:07.107]  Clean, efficient, natural gas fireplaces from gasfireplaces.com.
[02:04:07.107 --> 02:04:08.288]  Do they do deals?
[02:04:08.288 --> 02:04:08.848]  Deals!
[02:04:08.848 --> 02:04:10.749]  Up to 80% off for President's Day.
[02:04:10.749 --> 02:04:12.090]  Installed in less than a week.
[02:04:12.090 --> 02:04:13.051]  Wait a minute.
[02:04:13.051 --> 02:04:14.592]  I'm a president.
[02:04:14.592 --> 02:04:14.812]  80%?
[02:04:14.812 --> 02:04:17.334]  That's almost as high as my approval rating.
[02:04:17.334 --> 02:04:18.335]  Whatever you say, sir.
[02:04:18.335 --> 02:04:18.995]  You know what?
[02:04:18.995 --> 02:04:19.576]  I know deals.
[02:04:19.576 --> 02:04:20.897]  This is a tremendous deal.
[02:04:20.897 --> 02:04:21.697]  I gotta tweet this.
[02:04:21.697 --> 02:04:22.378]  Forget Twitter.
[02:04:22.378 --> 02:04:24.299]  Just go to gasfireplaces.com.
[02:04:24.299 --> 02:04:25.240]  Cypress Air is the best.
[02:04:26.164 --> 02:04:31.825]  Sneaky Alex stole your job, so... I'm making you Secretary of Offense!
[02:04:31.825 --> 02:04:41.808]  Now, prepare for fire and fury!
[02:04:41.808 --> 02:04:43.088]  You like that, Kirk Cousins?
[02:04:43.088 --> 02:04:44.789]  You like that?
[02:04:44.789 --> 02:04:46.429]  Mr. President, that's my line.
[02:04:46.429 --> 02:04:47.569]  No, you've been trumped.
[02:04:47.569 --> 02:04:48.590]  You know what I do like?
[02:04:48.590 --> 02:04:49.230]  Hold it back, folks.
[02:04:49.230 --> 02:04:49.810]  Stay with us.
[02:04:49.810 --> 02:04:51.230]  We got some big gas coming up.
[02:04:51.230 --> 02:04:52.371]  You'll want to stay with us.
[02:04:52.371 --> 02:04:53.591]  I'm gonna get into it when we come back from break.
[02:04:56.741 --> 02:04:58.704]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[02:04:58.704 --> 02:04:59.425]  Go ahead.
[02:04:59.425 --> 02:05:01.609]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[02:05:01.609 --> 02:05:04.674]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[02:05:05.507 --> 02:05:06.908]  It just gets old, man.
[02:05:06.908 --> 02:05:07.329]  You know what, Alex?
[02:05:28.089 --> 02:05:28.890]  Hey, Frank!
[02:05:28.890 --> 02:05:34.554]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[02:05:34.554 --> 02:05:39.058]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[02:05:39.058 --> 02:05:41.960]  I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[02:05:41.960 --> 02:05:42.680]  Do you understand?
[02:05:42.680 --> 02:05:44.322]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:05:44.322 --> 02:05:46.443]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:05:46.443 --> 02:05:52.068]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the Infowars.
[02:05:52.068 --> 02:05:52.768]  Do you understand?
[02:05:52.768 --> 02:05:54.410]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:05:54.410 --> 02:05:55.871]  Free Press needs your help, Frank!
[02:06:04.665 --> 02:06:09.069]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:06:09.069 --> 02:06:14.673]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:06:32.812 --> 02:06:44.840]  Andrei Afanasyev is going to be joining us, a top TV host, one of the top TV hosts in Russia, also a political scientist.
[02:06:44.840 --> 02:06:52.285]  He's going to be getting into the latest attempts to overthrow Russia and attempts to get President Trump to be tricked into war with Russia.
[02:06:52.285 --> 02:06:57.428]  We're going to meet the Playboy model running against Putin for president.
[02:06:58.479 --> 02:07:03.682]  Whose father died mysteriously when he was pro-Putin.
[02:07:03.682 --> 02:07:07.824]  I tell you, the Stockholm Syndrome isn't just in Stockholm, Sweden, my friends.
[02:07:07.824 --> 02:07:10.806]  So, that is coming up, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:07:10.806 --> 02:07:13.707]  This poor lady is being funded by Soros and others.
[02:07:13.707 --> 02:07:21.491]  But we're going to look at all of this with a top political analyst on the other side.
[02:07:21.491 --> 02:07:23.172]  But aren't the Russian ladies pretty, though?
[02:07:23.172 --> 02:07:25.273]  I mean, that's quite a nice export when they move over here.
[02:07:26.892 --> 02:07:33.677]  Why are we at war with Russia now that they're Christian and conservative and have twice the resources of African continent?
[02:07:33.677 --> 02:07:37.499]  That's why Trump is a capitalist and he's licking his lips.
[02:07:37.499 --> 02:07:39.521]  I'll tell you how you get to Russia.
[02:07:39.521 --> 02:07:44.204]  You go in there with free market and it's over.
[02:07:44.204 --> 02:07:49.868]  And it'll be like a man and woman climbing in bed together that have babies and are happily ever married.
[02:07:49.868 --> 02:07:55.012]  That's why the globalist hunchbacks up there on DC are crapping their little britches
[02:07:55.990 --> 02:08:03.974]  Because we're on the same parallels, we're lined up the same geography.
[02:08:03.974 --> 02:08:12.179]  Russia helped both times in the founding of our country, and then our own globalist liberals went and colonized Russia in 1917 and crapped all over it.
[02:08:13.154 --> 02:08:24.426]  And then had their greedy little globalist hands around their necks for 80-something years, and then now Russia helped us after 9-11, they helped us take out ISIS, and now Trump's moving troops onto the border and sending heavy weapons to Ukraine.
[02:08:24.426 --> 02:08:26.148]  It is a real, real shame.
[02:08:27.848 --> 02:08:30.109]  And, you know, I know why Trump's doing it.
[02:08:30.109 --> 02:08:30.889]  He's very hawkish.
[02:08:30.889 --> 02:08:31.989]  He respects the military.
[02:08:31.989 --> 02:08:34.890]  And you can see kind of a globalist view of Russia's got nukes.
[02:08:34.890 --> 02:08:35.930]  They're an adversary.
[02:08:35.930 --> 02:08:36.870]  You've got to be strong.
[02:08:36.870 --> 02:08:38.931]  You've got to encircle that threat.
[02:08:38.931 --> 02:08:42.912]  You know, don't just think you can make deals with them and then hope they won't use that to the advantage against us.
[02:08:42.912 --> 02:08:51.134]  Russia has signaled for 15 years plus they want economic development and they'll kill the weapons.
[02:08:51.134 --> 02:08:56.856]  But see, Hollywood, the left, the globalists, they've said they don't like having babies, being Christian.
[02:08:58.795 --> 02:09:00.136]  They don't like that.
[02:09:00.136 --> 02:09:08.703]  They want, just like MSNBC set up the State of the Union, they said, you don't talk about churches and you don't talk about families.
[02:09:08.703 --> 02:09:10.364]  That's a bygone era.
[02:09:10.364 --> 02:09:12.046]  You don't get that anymore.
[02:09:12.046 --> 02:09:12.926]  That was put out.
[02:09:12.926 --> 02:09:14.448]  I'm not going to play it again.
[02:09:14.448 --> 02:09:18.551]  We've already covered it probably 20 times since last Tuesday night.
[02:09:18.551 --> 02:09:21.794]  But that's the attitude.
[02:09:21.794 --> 02:09:23.195]  We're going to take everything you've got.
[02:09:24.172 --> 02:09:25.393]  And that's what globalists do.
[02:09:25.393 --> 02:09:26.694]  They make you poor.
[02:09:26.694 --> 02:09:28.035]  And they're in a race to make you poor.
[02:09:28.035 --> 02:09:31.478]  And Trump is in a race to get wealth into the country.
[02:09:31.478 --> 02:09:33.420]  And he's expanding a very dangerous bubble to do it.
[02:09:33.420 --> 02:09:36.262]  But it's like somebody's already dying.
[02:09:36.262 --> 02:09:38.223]  One of my good friends died when he was 33.
[02:09:38.223 --> 02:09:41.906]  He was like an angel once he was dead.
[02:09:41.906 --> 02:09:43.288]  He was fighting for his life.
[02:09:43.288 --> 02:09:48.212]  Organ failure from an infective bacteria he got from a small surgery.
[02:09:48.212 --> 02:09:50.794]  And Ryan Baxter.
[02:09:51.960 --> 02:09:53.180]  He was sitting there fighting for his life.
[02:09:53.180 --> 02:09:55.221]  I was there when he died.
[02:09:55.221 --> 02:09:58.602]  And his dad was driving down from Dallas, racing to see him.
[02:09:58.602 --> 02:10:01.143]  And they came in and they said, look, he's gone already.
[02:10:01.143 --> 02:10:04.325]  They said, we can give him this adrenaline and all the rest of it.
[02:10:04.325 --> 02:10:08.506]  It may kill him right now, but it'll bring him back up for maybe 20, 30 minutes.
[02:10:08.506 --> 02:10:09.566]  So you guys can say bye to him.
[02:10:09.566 --> 02:10:10.067]  He was gone.
[02:10:10.067 --> 02:10:10.247]  Coma.
[02:10:11.069 --> 02:10:11.369]  We're good.
[02:10:30.285 --> 02:10:31.205]  That's what Trump's doing, man.
[02:10:31.205 --> 02:10:33.786]  He's just ejecting adrenaline, just hitting us.
[02:10:33.786 --> 02:10:35.986]  Trying to get our heart going.
[02:10:35.986 --> 02:10:40.267]  And all the Democrats and all of them are trying to pull his hands off, and they're fighting him.
[02:10:40.267 --> 02:10:45.888]  But we've got a chance to get the engine going again, and a bunch of black smoke comes out, but we can get going down the road.
[02:10:45.888 --> 02:10:48.849]  We're not as far gone as my friend was.
[02:10:48.849 --> 02:10:50.849]  And Trump hadn't used all the adrenaline yet.
[02:10:50.849 --> 02:10:55.130]  We're starting to come back, and the little gremlins are in there trying to suck our blood and bring us down.
[02:10:55.130 --> 02:10:59.011]  And Trump is loading up the big syringe, man.
[02:11:00.046 --> 02:11:01.367]  And it's like, what are we going to do?
[02:11:01.367 --> 02:11:05.610]  Because it may make us have a giant heart attack, may blow the whole economy the other way.
[02:11:05.610 --> 02:11:10.094]  I know exactly what Trump's doing.
[02:11:10.094 --> 02:11:14.717]  And he just wants to bring America back and prove it.
[02:11:14.717 --> 02:11:16.098]  So he's like, fine, you want Russia?
[02:11:16.098 --> 02:11:17.259]  Move the troops in!
[02:11:17.259 --> 02:11:18.100]  Send in the weapons!
[02:11:18.100 --> 02:11:20.602]  Attack them!
[02:11:20.602 --> 02:11:24.224]  That's still not enough, is it?
[02:11:24.224 --> 02:11:27.307]  But we have nuclear war with Russia that won't be in America anyways.
[02:11:27.307 --> 02:11:28.708]  So I know exactly what Trump's doing.
[02:11:31.636 --> 02:11:32.617]  He's got U.S.
[02:11:32.617 --> 02:11:39.702]  advisors in there helping the Ukrainians in street battles with the Russians right up against the border with Russia in eastern Ukraine.
[02:11:39.702 --> 02:11:42.644]  Right now to prove he's not a Russian agent.
[02:11:42.644 --> 02:11:49.689]  When you got Hillary Clinton and all these dirtbags are the ones that were on the Russian payroll because they will come by you off to get your uranium.
[02:11:49.689 --> 02:11:50.609]  What do you think the U.S.
[02:11:50.609 --> 02:11:50.969]  does?
[02:11:50.969 --> 02:11:54.032]  Every government does this.
[02:11:54.032 --> 02:11:58.295]  The difference is the Communist Chinese are the real threat and they're the ones derailing the trains.
[02:11:58.295 --> 02:11:59.656]  I've got that from multiple sources.
[02:11:59.656 --> 02:12:00.116]  They're the ones
[02:12:02.432 --> 02:12:14.099]  EMPing and shutting down the ships, and they got freighters nearby that then ram them, that are under Communist Party, Chinese Party military flags.
[02:12:14.099 --> 02:12:19.642]  They don't even hide it.
[02:12:19.642 --> 02:12:22.924]  So we're at war with China right now.
[02:12:22.924 --> 02:12:30.289]  And China owns Hollywood, and it's just, just, I mean, that's why last year, not this year, but last year, Davos, they sent
[02:12:32.435 --> 02:12:40.419]  The Chinese president, never been there, and he said, I will defeat Trump, I will defeat America, we will bring in world government.
[02:12:40.419 --> 02:12:41.519]  These are quotes.
[02:12:41.519 --> 02:12:49.663]  And Juncker, the heir to the Nazi fortune, his dad was the right hand man of Hitler, the actual power behind the throne that funded the whole deal.
[02:12:49.663 --> 02:12:52.684]  That and the Mingalas were involved as well.
[02:12:52.684 --> 02:12:54.825]  They just let Mingala go for no reason, he was German royalty.
[02:12:55.916 --> 02:12:57.177]  And so is Juncker.
[02:12:57.177 --> 02:12:59.660]  He's related to the Queen of England, all of them.
[02:12:59.660 --> 02:13:05.985]  And they shook hands and pledged, and then Juncker, after the meeting, said, we'll stop Trump.
[02:13:05.985 --> 02:13:07.767]  Remember, it's in January, right after he got sworn in.
[02:13:07.767 --> 02:13:10.610]  He goes, we will defeat America with China's help.
[02:13:10.610 --> 02:13:19.558]  I mean, do you think the Nazi heir, with the Nazi collaborator Soros, with the communist Chinese dictator, that sells political dissidents organs,
[02:13:20.945 --> 02:13:29.210]  Are on TV saying we will defeat America, America's done, the Chinese century's here.
[02:13:29.210 --> 02:13:32.612]  And Europe's done, we're bringing in Muslims.
[02:13:32.612 --> 02:13:39.976]  You'd think every American would turn aside from their dumb politics and say that's wrong, but no!
[02:13:39.976 --> 02:13:42.017]  Because nobody's telling them but us.
[02:13:43.499 --> 02:13:46.020]  And they know if the word gets out, finally it is.
[02:13:46.020 --> 02:13:50.982]  Even in Bezos' Washington Post, they're catching communist Chinese government intelligence agencies.
[02:13:50.982 --> 02:13:54.904]  They caught them basically running the University of Texas, engineering department.
[02:13:54.904 --> 02:13:57.044]  What are you, that's DARPA over there.
[02:13:57.044 --> 02:14:00.466]  Oh yeah, they caught them running the DARPA facility, underground.
[02:14:00.466 --> 02:14:05.048]  They got nuclear reactors, they got, I'm not gonna even get into what I've been told they got over there.
[02:14:05.048 --> 02:14:06.288]  And I've confirmed it as well.
[02:14:06.288 --> 02:14:06.989]  They got it all.
[02:14:06.989 --> 02:14:10.350]  And it's all funny to them.
[02:14:10.350 --> 02:14:12.831]  And so, we're totally penetrated.
[02:14:14.019 --> 02:14:16.361]  We got the Communist Chinese on our backs.
[02:14:16.361 --> 02:14:17.442]  They're on their own people's backs.
[02:14:17.442 --> 02:14:22.827]  We got Hollywood, Democratic Party scum, cowardly bluebloods that are in the Republican Party that only care about themselves.
[02:14:22.827 --> 02:14:31.255]  But here comes Nunes and a few other people that are willing to fight, and President Trump, and the tide turns just like that.
[02:14:31.255 --> 02:14:34.458]  And then we've got all these other articles here.
[02:14:36.220 --> 02:14:39.023]  There's a Kit Daniels article up on Infowars.com.
[02:14:39.023 --> 02:14:51.775]  Study reveals science behind soy boys, gender-bending chemicals found in 86% of teenagers in Europe and the United States, turning men feminine, turning women hyper-feminine, and accelerating breast cancer.
[02:14:51.775 --> 02:14:53.537]  Yep, there's your source.
[02:14:53.537 --> 02:14:57.180]  Women would think, oh, a bunch of extra estrogen and stuff, I'm going to be super feminine.
[02:14:57.180 --> 02:14:58.622]  No, it accelerates your aging.
[02:15:00.091 --> 02:15:04.392]  And gives you cysts on your ovaries, gives you accelerated endometriosis.
[02:15:04.392 --> 02:15:06.412]  I mean, they're talking like I've told you in studies.
[02:15:06.412 --> 02:15:11.753]  A 40-year-old woman in the U.S., on average, has got like an 80-year-old woman's uterus.
[02:15:11.753 --> 02:15:14.494]  And her breasts are like 100-year-old woman's.
[02:15:14.494 --> 02:15:15.654]  You're like, well, they don't look like it.
[02:15:15.654 --> 02:15:19.295]  No, the cellular mutations are.
[02:15:19.295 --> 02:15:25.556]  Because you're drinking glyphosate, sweetheart, and it's going to turn your man into a woman, and it's going to turn you into dead.

[02:15:28.188 --> 02:15:33.932]  It's gonna turn your man into a woman, and it's gonna turn you into six feet under.
[02:15:33.932 --> 02:15:36.414]  And that's all mainstream news.

[02:15:43.078 --> 02:15:44.979]  And I'm not proud of that fact.
[02:15:44.979 --> 02:15:47.861]  We're just stating the facts here and fighting for humanity.
[02:15:47.861 --> 02:15:50.663]  Because you know, I don't want my three girls to die like this.

[02:17:59.884 --> 02:18:07.129]  Proper B vitamin intake is essential to keep the body functioning at optimum levels.
[02:18:07.129 --> 02:18:15.894]  With our modern diets, it can be hard to get the recommended amount of B vitamins we need every day.

[02:18:44.694 --> 02:18:51.297]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that
[02:19:05.183 --> 02:19:16.014]  When you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other materiel from infowarsstore.com, you are funding the revolution.

[02:20:07.557 --> 02:20:15.559]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:25.240 --> 02:20:32.025]  Andrei Afanasyev is our guest for the next 45 minutes, and I don't watch a lot of Russian television.
[02:20:32.025 --> 02:20:35.928]  I don't watch a lot of British television or German TV, but I recognize this guy.
[02:20:35.928 --> 02:20:38.269]  He's all over national television.
[02:20:38.269 --> 02:20:40.011]  He's a journalist, TV host.
[02:20:40.831 --> 02:20:46.417]  I had a political department at Russia's first independent pro-Christian conservative political TV channel.
[02:20:46.417 --> 02:20:55.927]  Previously worked for RT and currently authors and hosts the show Russian Answer, a daily digest and analysis of the most important political news.
[02:20:56.488 --> 02:21:01.430]  As political scientist, his interest in European, US, and Mideast policies and studies.
[02:21:01.430 --> 02:21:04.572]  He specializes in European regionalism and populism.
[02:21:04.572 --> 02:21:13.456]  He's a guest speaker at political shows including BBC, TRT in Turkey, M6 France, as well as Russian International Affairs Council.
[02:21:13.456 --> 02:21:17.818]  He regularly lectures on geopolitics, media warfare, and political philosophy.
[02:21:17.818 --> 02:21:20.139]  And before I go to him, let me say this.
[02:21:20.139 --> 02:21:24.301]  They have said, because I've been on RT, that I must be a Russian agent in Congress.
[02:21:26.201 --> 02:21:30.863]  Adam Schiff has said that in a report they put out that I was in there that I've been on Russian TV.
[02:21:30.863 --> 02:21:33.204]  Schiff's been on RT more than I have.
[02:21:33.204 --> 02:21:34.725]  We played clips of it earlier.
[02:21:34.725 --> 02:21:39.107]  So this idea is keep us apart, don't be diplomatic, don't talk to each other.
[02:21:39.107 --> 02:21:42.588]  That's what causes wars and that's what cults do.
[02:21:42.588 --> 02:21:44.509]  But then expanding on that,
[02:21:46.820 --> 02:22:03.306]  Trump's big failure, even though I admire him, he's a nationalist, he's a patriot, he has been pushed into weapons to Ukraine, even though his platform at the RNC said he wouldn't, encircling Russia, not giving Russia credit for being 90% of the takeout of ISIS.
[02:22:03.306 --> 02:22:11.649]  And that's the one area Trump, who normally can't be bullied, is being bullied, and it's because it's the neocons, the military-industrial complex, not just Hollywood and the media.
[02:22:11.649 --> 02:22:15.791]  It's that combination that's doing it, and it's endangering our world, while China,
[02:22:16.943 --> 02:22:22.067]  Has hundreds of times the influence that's admitted domestically in Hollywood and media universities.
[02:22:22.067 --> 02:22:28.012]  The Washington Post admits every major state-funded university has been penetrated by the Chinese intelligence bureaus.
[02:22:28.012 --> 02:22:29.854]  And I'm not looking to start a fight with them.
[02:22:29.854 --> 02:22:33.377]  The point is, is that they're the main ones putting the propaganda out.
[02:22:33.377 --> 02:22:36.680]  Show that, you know, that's using, I guess, art of war stuff.
[02:22:36.680 --> 02:22:39.983]  While we're busy fighting with Russia, they're taking over the entire planet.
[02:22:40.603 --> 02:22:42.584]  But enough intro by me.
[02:22:42.584 --> 02:22:44.226]  That's where I stand on this.
[02:22:44.226 --> 02:22:54.392]  I see Russia becoming Christian, conservative, cutting taxes, coming back from the dead under the same globalist, liberal brainwashing exported from New York and London in 1917.
[02:22:54.392 --> 02:22:57.354]  That's what I see as someone who's never been to Russia but studied history.
[02:22:57.354 --> 02:23:06.741]  And I see them coming back from the dead as we hopefully will come back from the dead without having to go through the nightmares that Chuckie Schumer and others would put us under.
[02:23:06.741 --> 02:23:07.902]  So I'm going to try to shut up and let
[02:23:08.872 --> 02:23:28.177]  Andre from his own perspective big picture where Russia is who they really are versus what we hear about the media because again I see from studying the real Putin trying to stabilize the country trying to stabilize families the opposite of Hollywood and a lot of big Hollywood people said Hollywood hates Russia because
[02:23:28.937 --> 02:23:40.142]  It's Christian now and not like their little play thing when Bernie Sanders went there in the 70s for his honeymoon in the middle of Moscow when you couldn't go there if you weren't a godless atheist, you know, whatever.
[02:23:40.142 --> 02:23:44.784]  So again, the left wants to persecute Americans like they did in Russia.
[02:23:44.784 --> 02:23:45.944]  They want to persecute Christians.
[02:23:45.944 --> 02:23:46.764]  That's my view.
[02:23:46.764 --> 02:23:50.466]  Am I wrong, Andrei Afanasyev?
[02:23:50.466 --> 02:23:51.926]  Is that correct or is that wrong?
[02:23:51.926 --> 02:23:53.107]  Fill us in on the big picture.
[02:23:54.734 --> 02:23:55.715]  Alex, thank you so much.
[02:23:55.715 --> 02:24:02.498]  Yes, my name is Andrey Afanasyev and I'm really happy to be with you and with your viewers, the InfoWars team.
[02:24:02.498 --> 02:24:07.340]  So, of course, you're right and we've been covering the U.S.
[02:24:07.340 --> 02:24:08.821]  policies for very long.
[02:24:08.821 --> 02:24:13.303]  I've myself been an international journalist for almost 10 years already.
[02:24:13.303 --> 02:24:17.625]  And I can tell you that we know really more about U.S.
[02:24:17.625 --> 02:24:19.866]  here in Russia than you know about us.
[02:24:19.866 --> 02:24:20.787]  And that's a big problem.
[02:24:21.659 --> 02:24:33.167]  And I can tell you that judging by the events of the last couple of years, I can tell you that US now is in a state where Russia was in 1917.
[02:24:33.167 --> 02:24:44.295]  You know that in 1917 we suffered a terrible revolution and our people was technically conquered by a group of radicals called Bolsheviks.
[02:24:44.295 --> 02:24:44.675]  They were
[02:24:45.690 --> 02:24:53.158]  Fanatics, ultra-leftists, and for more than 70 years we've been suffering from this.
[02:24:53.158 --> 02:25:00.386]  And what we see now is that US and Trump is trying to fight the very same issue.
[02:25:00.386 --> 02:25:06.293]  US, to my mind, is on the verge of this happening really, really seriously.
[02:25:06.713 --> 02:25:20.918]  I'm not talking about that all the population of the United States is under control, but definitely, as you said, the main infrastructure, the propaganda instruments, the financial instruments, of course, are definitely not in the hands of American people.
[02:25:23.796 --> 02:25:33.943]  The thing is that for more than 70 years, for the period of Soviet Union, Russia was not defending its national interests.
[02:25:33.943 --> 02:25:35.164]  It's very, very important.
[02:25:35.164 --> 02:25:40.528]  The Soviet Russia was working and defending for the globalist ideology of Bolshevism.
[02:25:41.338 --> 02:25:54.535]  And our people and the whole the old peoples of Soviet Russia, the 300 million people were working for that were some kind of a owner of a parasite.
[02:25:54.535 --> 02:25:55.656]  And we managed to
[02:25:57.037 --> 02:26:07.808]  Get rid of it in 1991, we also suffered a lot of turmoil, the collapse of the Soviet Union, we lost a lot of territories, but still we managed to preserve ourselves, our sovereignty.
[02:26:07.808 --> 02:26:14.114]  And I can tell you that US seems to me like in process of also spitting out this parasite.
[02:26:14.714 --> 02:26:23.781]  At least a lot of people have woken up, as I can see, now judging by media, especially independent and fair media like yours.
[02:26:23.781 --> 02:26:38.691]  And I can see that also with the victory of Donald Trump in late 2016, we see this process of fighting against this parasite inside American society.
[02:26:39.608 --> 02:26:47.431]  And it seems to me that it's a tough fight, and by now, here from Moscow, we cannot tell who will win.
[02:26:47.431 --> 02:26:54.333]  We hope that the real people, the real Americans, the traditionals, the Christians, will win.
[02:26:54.333 --> 02:27:01.435]  But the events of 2017 say that it's a tough fight, but we support you.
[02:27:02.679 --> 02:27:03.520]  Wow!
[02:27:03.520 --> 02:27:19.542]  Again, I've just read Solzhenitsyn's writings, but also a lot of mainline writings and studies, and it's very clear, it's mainline history, that a bunch of liberal Bolshevik communists couldn't overthrow Germany, they couldn't overthrow England or the U.S., so they got together with big financing by JPMorgan and others, and went over and
[02:27:20.879 --> 02:27:40.149]  Both overthrew Moscow only, kind of like Antifa, got control of that, and then expanded out for decades before they got full control, then used the might of Russia, its resources and people, to then persecute Poland, Ukraine, expand all over, expand into Cuba, and do all this while being directed by groups in London and the U.S.
[02:27:40.149 --> 02:27:47.193]  And even George Orwell went public before he died and said this, and apologized, and said, this is horrible, we've got to stop this.
[02:27:47.193 --> 02:27:49.274]  But this big secret has been kept from the people.
[02:27:49.694 --> 02:27:52.116]  And so what you're saying is, and it's true, the U.S.
[02:27:52.116 --> 02:28:04.528]  is trying to pull out of Bolshevism before we fully go into it and the nightmare ride that you and your Russian ancestors had to endure.
[02:28:04.528 --> 02:28:05.508]  Yes, definitely.
[02:28:05.508 --> 02:28:14.737]  And we must understand, as I say to my students, that the world now is in a state of, as I call it, global civil war.
[02:28:15.698 --> 02:28:26.479]  It means that technically all the world now with the technology and with the globalized informational infrastructure is a battlefield of ideas.
[02:28:27.225 --> 02:28:47.990]  And it's a fight between globalists that support the idea of global government controlled by financial elites and traditionalists and conservatives, Christians, who you can call us, whatever, people who want to preserve their national identity, people who want to live according to the rules.
[02:28:47.990 --> 02:28:48.770]  Hold on, stay there.
[02:28:48.770 --> 02:28:49.951]  This is so powerful.
[02:28:49.951 --> 02:28:52.691]  And you're hearing what is on national Russian TV.
[02:28:52.691 --> 02:28:54.212]  That's why they're so scared of Russia, folks.
[02:28:54.212 --> 02:28:54.652]  They're awake.
[02:28:55.598 --> 02:28:57.499]  Fully cooked, ready-to-eat bacon.

[02:30:00.314 --> 02:30:11.821]  We have found extraordinary new natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory health and normal breathing.
[02:30:11.821 --> 02:30:12.702]  This is pollen blood.
[02:30:13.722 --> 02:30:26.387]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs from specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like runny nose, itchy watery eyes, and excessive mucous production.
[02:30:26.387 --> 02:30:30.709]  They began studying the effects in published trials, in their published trials.
[02:30:30.709 --> 02:30:34.711]  Now we are introducing the fruit of the research, a fast-acting chewable tablet,
[02:30:35.191 --> 02:30:39.713]  You know, I've got some talking points here about Caveman from InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:31:01.403 --> 02:31:05.167]  But instead of going on those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[02:31:05.167 --> 02:31:09.752]  From all the wives' tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[02:31:09.752 --> 02:31:12.875]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[02:31:12.875 --> 02:31:15.999]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[02:31:17.495 --> 02:31:30.346]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.

[02:32:59.751 --> 02:33:02.373]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:17.750 --> 02:33:19.374]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:33:19.374 --> 02:33:24.588]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:39.113 --> 02:33:47.919]  Andrew Afanasyev is our guest for the rest of the hour or five minutes the next hour before we have our other guest host joining us.
[02:33:47.919 --> 02:33:55.965]  You talk about riveting information, that'll be Doug Hagman always doing an amazing job with all of his intel, on what's really going on.
[02:33:55.965 --> 02:34:01.489]  Russia had multinational global interest big banks that financed in 1917 less than 10,000 armed
[02:34:05.919 --> 02:34:19.296]  Fighters to go in, a lot of them World War I veterans, who happen to be of Russian ancestry and other ancestry, to go in, Russian speakers, kill the police, the military, tell the rest of the country, we're gonna have a peace deal.
[02:34:20.322 --> 02:34:21.643]  Just turn in your guns.
[02:34:21.643 --> 02:34:25.325]  It took him a couple years to even get control of the areas around Moscow.
[02:34:25.325 --> 02:34:27.866]  He can correct me as a historian, a political scientist.
[02:34:27.866 --> 02:34:29.727]  I'm not a Russian, but I've studied it.
[02:34:29.727 --> 02:34:35.511]  And then they just start taking over, killing the Christians, slaughtering, I mean, just raping.
[02:34:35.511 --> 02:34:37.832]  They told Lenin, they said, sir, we've already killed millions.
[02:34:37.832 --> 02:34:38.232]  How many more?
[02:34:38.232 --> 02:34:40.194]  He goes, I want terror.
[02:34:40.194 --> 02:34:42.995]  He would look at maps and go, go in this town and kill all the Christians.
[02:34:42.995 --> 02:34:44.556]  Go in that town and kill all the Christians.
[02:34:44.556 --> 02:34:46.117]  Go in this town and kill all the Christians.
[02:34:46.117 --> 02:34:46.777]  They said, why?
[02:34:46.777 --> 02:34:47.518]  They've all submitted.
[02:34:47.518 --> 02:34:49.299]  They said, I want blood!
[02:34:51.067 --> 02:34:54.291]  You can hear Bernie Sanders almost like, I want to teach him!
[02:34:54.291 --> 02:35:02.841]  And so, you've got the floor for this segment, the next, you, you, you, repeat what you were saying as you got cut off by the break about how there's a global civil war.
[02:35:04.144 --> 02:35:27.769]  Versus nationalist, free-market, populist, just traditionalist, and this global mega-control combine that is like Bolshevism 2.0, but the big mega-banks and mega-tech companies, in their own words, operating as authoritarian technocrats, the new robber barons, just as the robber barons financed the takeover of Russia, and then used Russia in the exploitive phase to take over much of the world.
[02:35:30.090 --> 02:35:37.777]  Now we see them in a fit that all over the world, as the internet they wanted to use to control us, is used to expose them.
[02:35:37.777 --> 02:35:45.185]  So let's talk about what's happened in history, what's happening now, this meet-the-playboy model running against Putin for president.
[02:35:45.185 --> 02:35:47.888]  We'll get into all that as well, but please go ahead and break it down for us.
[02:35:49.289 --> 02:35:50.330]  Yes, thank you, Alex.
[02:35:50.330 --> 02:36:16.426]  So, first of all, we're in a state of a global civil war, as you said, between globalists in support of a global liberal market and controlled by the global government, and nationalists, conservative traditions, who just want to live their lives as their fathers did on their land, and not attacking and fighting with each other.
[02:36:16.426 --> 02:36:18.087]  And the thing is that
[02:36:18.718 --> 02:36:23.226]  In the whole world, in any country in the world, there are now these two camps.
[02:36:23.226 --> 02:36:25.750]  But there are different shares of such people.
[02:36:26.830 --> 02:36:41.173]  And for example, Europe is almost totally controlled now by these people, politically, but the people of Europe, or I mean ordinary people, some of the military servicemen, are usually populists.
[02:36:41.173 --> 02:36:52.735]  And we see now that in some countries, for example, in Eastern Europe, in Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, now Austria, we see populists
[02:36:53.915 --> 02:37:01.058]  Pro-nationalist, pro-sovereignty governments winning and forming the majority.
[02:37:01.058 --> 02:37:05.560]  In Russia, I could say that the share is 80 to 20.
[02:37:05.560 --> 02:37:14.604]  80% of Russians of any level are in support of national, rational, sovereign government.
[02:37:14.604 --> 02:37:18.045]  Is it fair to say Russia is the most awake country in the world of the globalists?
[02:37:19.808 --> 02:37:22.650]  I could say so because we suffered most.
[02:37:22.650 --> 02:37:32.756]  I can tell you that today is a date that 100 years ago the first Orthodox bishop was killed by Bolsheviks.
[02:37:32.756 --> 02:37:36.418]  It was February 5th of 1918, right after the Bolsheviks came to power.
[02:37:42.606 --> 02:37:50.412]  So, the first thing they started, as you said, was destroying the Orthodox Church and killing all the priests.
[02:37:50.412 --> 02:37:59.059]  For 15 years, they killed 120,000 priests, only priests, out of all 150,000.
[02:37:59.059 --> 02:38:08.626]  And by the middle of World War II, or Great Patriotic War for us, we had like several bishops left out of hundreds.
[02:38:09.026 --> 02:38:17.737]  And the persecution of Christians, I mean the radical, the violent persecution finished, I think, only after World War II.
[02:38:17.737 --> 02:38:24.786]  Because during the World War II, the Bolsheviks understood that the only way to win is to ask for support of Church.
[02:38:25.226 --> 02:38:31.288]  Because people still under the reign of the government were Christian and were traditionalist.
[02:38:31.288 --> 02:38:46.211]  According to census of 1936, it's during Stalin era, 20 years after the revolution, still 37% of all people in Russia said that they were Orthodox.
[02:38:46.211 --> 02:38:53.213]  You must understand that these are 37% of all nation that were ready to suffer and go to prison for that.
[02:38:54.016 --> 02:38:56.637]  It's not like just an anonymous census.
[02:38:56.637 --> 02:38:59.597]  People come to your place and say, do you believe in God?
[02:38:59.597 --> 02:39:00.497]  Yes.
[02:39:00.497 --> 02:39:04.758]  And you just can be taken to camp and never go back.
[02:39:04.758 --> 02:39:06.018]  So this is the point.
[02:39:06.018 --> 02:39:11.659]  Even in such times, 37% of people were brave enough to say that.
[02:39:11.659 --> 02:39:17.180]  And the point is that now in the world, we see the same.
[02:39:17.180 --> 02:39:20.821]  We see how Christians and Christian values have been oppressed.
[02:39:21.719 --> 02:39:31.502]  We see how anti-Christian lifestyle has been promoted in media, in films, even in video games.
[02:39:31.502 --> 02:39:39.004]  And now in a lot of countries it has been promoted in schools, even in kindergartens to children.
[02:39:39.524 --> 02:39:43.787]  So it's something that the majority of Russians cannot tolerate.
[02:39:43.787 --> 02:39:46.129]  So that's why we chose another way.
[02:39:46.129 --> 02:39:57.237]  And the interesting thing about current America, Trump's America, is now that it resembles Russia of 1999, when Putin came.
[02:39:57.237 --> 02:40:00.039]  Because from 1991, after the collapse of the Soviet Union,
[02:40:00.629 --> 02:40:05.511]  Until 1999, Russia also was not sovereign and independent.
[02:40:05.511 --> 02:40:10.252]  It was under control of liberal, globalist kleptocrats.
[02:40:10.252 --> 02:40:14.954]  Just the oligarchs who, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, they were ex-communists.
[02:40:14.954 --> 02:40:18.135]  Most of them were ex-members of the Communist Party.
[02:40:18.135 --> 02:40:21.336]  And then, in the beginning of the 90s, they just shifted.
[02:40:21.976 --> 02:40:36.511]  And changed their ideology and became not communists for like, you know, communist economy, planning economy, and became super globalist liberal oligarchs that started...
[02:40:37.271 --> 02:40:43.452]  Oh, it's on record that Western companies lined up to just come use the Russians and others like total slaves.
[02:40:43.452 --> 02:40:47.133]  Then they would use, again, the Russians to march into nearby areas and use them as slaves.
[02:40:47.133 --> 02:40:49.353]  Then Russia gets the blame, the globalists don't.
[02:40:49.353 --> 02:41:03.236]  Just like they use America to go out and build empire, and then America gets the blame, and our vets that die get the blame, but not the people up in the big, you know, ivory towers, who then fund the very movements hating the country when they're in command of it, using it to do the bad.
[02:41:03.236 --> 02:41:05.716]  So they know how to put the country in double pressure.
[02:41:07.569 --> 02:41:08.110]  Definitely.
[02:41:08.110 --> 02:41:10.271]  They work like a typical parasite.
[02:41:10.271 --> 02:41:12.393]  They need a body to operate inside.
[02:41:12.393 --> 02:41:18.638]  They cannot form their own army, at least by now, thank God, of, like, globalists.
[02:41:18.638 --> 02:41:29.566]  They infect, they infest different societies, different groups of people and make them do whatever they want and whatever they need.
[02:41:29.566 --> 02:41:31.708]  So, and when Putin came,
[02:41:32.248 --> 02:41:33.889]  Things started changing.
[02:41:33.889 --> 02:41:35.829]  I can tell you because I remember it.
[02:41:35.829 --> 02:41:39.730]  Putin came to a country that was a brink of a total collapse.
[02:41:39.730 --> 02:41:43.571]  And we were in a state of a civil war in Chechnya.
[02:41:43.571 --> 02:41:55.375]  This war also was instigated and funded from abroad, from globalist institutions and their networks in the Middle East.
[02:41:55.375 --> 02:41:59.436]  So, Putin came and the first thing that he did, he stopped the civil war.
[02:42:00.299 --> 02:42:03.543]  And after that, he gathered all the oligarchs.
[02:42:03.543 --> 02:42:11.093]  It was a very famous, you know, so-called picnic outside of Moscow and said, OK, now the rules are different.
[02:42:11.093 --> 02:42:17.422]  You either become like national businessmen or we will work with you.
[02:42:18.459 --> 02:42:40.701]  Stay right there, we'll come back, we'll talk about this, because as you said, when Trump said, I admire Putin, he's strong for nationalism, and he did, it's admitted Trump is using the blueprint that Putin used to take the country back, turn the country back on, line up the oligarchs, get the ones that join in the wood, go after those that wouldn't, and so when they talk about Russian collusion, it's only in the blueprint of Putin that there is collusion.
[02:42:41.081 --> 02:42:51.478]  There is no real collusion except in spirit and action from the already successful blueprint with Russia now leading the world with nationalism against globalism.
[02:42:51.478 --> 02:42:54.483]  That's the only true collusion is in diagram.
[02:42:56.454 --> 02:43:01.160]  You deserve a deep restful sleep with Knockout by InfoWars Life.

[02:46:39.151 --> 02:46:45.656]  As you know, I coined the term 360Win, and with the new AutoShip feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[02:46:45.656 --> 02:46:47.158]  10% off on AutoShip.

[02:46:59.705 --> 02:47:02.346]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:13.732 --> 02:47:16.974]  Andrei Afanasyev is our guest.
[02:47:16.974 --> 02:47:21.237]  We're going to put on screen the different national TV networks he's on.
[02:47:21.237 --> 02:47:27.561]  Again, I hardly watch Russian television, even though I'm supposedly a Russian agent.
[02:47:27.561 --> 02:47:31.984]  I've seen him on national Russian TV, both private, state-run, you name it.
[02:47:31.984 --> 02:47:33.705]  Everything here is basically globalist-run.
[02:47:33.705 --> 02:47:35.627]  They're going to have these new ads up.
[02:47:36.969 --> 02:47:41.393]  These new blockers up claiming that everything's state-run and that InfoWars is state-run.
[02:47:41.393 --> 02:47:43.755]  I'm going to have to sue them over this.
[02:47:43.755 --> 02:47:44.516]  But here's an example.
[02:47:44.516 --> 02:47:46.798]  Hold on to your tinfoil hat, Alex Jones.
[02:47:46.798 --> 02:47:48.079]  YouTube is coming for you.
[02:47:48.079 --> 02:47:54.105]  And they say, we're shutting down state sponsors like RT and Alex Jones that works for them.
[02:47:54.105 --> 02:47:59.029]  It's like learning I work for the Antarctic Post Office or something.
[02:47:59.029 --> 02:48:00.811]  It's just crazy.
[02:48:01.778 --> 02:48:09.180]  So we'll talk about how they're going to strike back and how the globalists hope to win this war against nationalism, against self-determination.
[02:48:09.180 --> 02:48:16.261]  Does it mean that Andre or Alex or Matt Drudge or Donald Trump that we're offering a utopia ourselves?
[02:48:16.261 --> 02:48:17.261]  No!
[02:48:17.261 --> 02:48:25.943]  We're offering the real struggle of free market that does build people up and being able to practice your religion or not or whatever, not being colonized by globalists.
[02:48:25.943 --> 02:48:28.144]  But riveting radio here, just briefly.
[02:48:29.667 --> 02:48:31.168]  They're trying to shut us down, as you know.
[02:48:31.168 --> 02:48:34.912]  They won't even let us advertise on Google, which is like 90% of advertising online.
[02:48:34.912 --> 02:48:36.133]  They're shutting us down all over the place.
[02:48:36.133 --> 02:48:41.098]  But despite that, they've got all these new TV stations picking us up, UHF, EHF cable.
[02:48:41.098 --> 02:48:44.001]  I didn't want to create a list of them, because they'll get harassed for doing it.
[02:48:44.001 --> 02:48:45.382]  But people know what's happening.
[02:48:45.382 --> 02:48:49.806]  So the Streisand effect is in play, where they're trying to suppress us, and it's causing an explosion.
[02:48:51.141 --> 02:48:55.065]  We've got high-quality nutraceutical supplements like Cell Force, 53% off.
[02:48:55.065 --> 02:48:57.068]  It's really going to be called DNA Force Plus.
[02:48:57.068 --> 02:48:59.390]  Stronger than DNA Force, but lower price.
[02:48:59.390 --> 02:49:01.332]  We've got the Pollen Block about to sell out.
[02:49:01.332 --> 02:49:05.196]  We've got the Shirt of the Month, Trump Pants, a true vision for the future.
[02:49:05.196 --> 02:49:09.962]  Brain Force, 25% off, and a bunch of other specials that are about to end because we're selling out
[02:49:11.574 --> 02:49:11.914]  Of course.
[02:49:35.589 --> 02:49:37.550]  I feel sorry for my mother.
[02:49:37.550 --> 02:49:39.312]  She's tough, but she's like, good God.
[02:49:39.312 --> 02:49:42.294]  I mean, we were having dinner about a month ago, and she goes, is it really worth all this?
[02:49:42.294 --> 02:49:44.676]  Because I'm not going to give them the pleasure of getting into what's going on.
[02:49:44.676 --> 02:49:47.618]  There's criminal investigations into them as well, because they're so desperate.
[02:49:47.618 --> 02:49:49.319]  They've done a lot of crimes.
[02:49:49.319 --> 02:49:52.842]  But I mean, they've spent $10 million, we confirm.
[02:49:52.842 --> 02:49:59.767]  We even got people on tape admitting it, through Soros groups, just to try to destroy me on the ground.
[02:50:00.612 --> 02:50:06.278]  But I'm such a recluse because I just work and then go home with my family that they haven't been able to do anything, and they're really pissed off.
[02:50:06.278 --> 02:50:10.222]  I'm just telling you right now, what you've seen happen to Steven Seagal, they've tried all that with me.
[02:50:10.222 --> 02:50:14.026]  There's just nothing there because I'm so boring, okay?
[02:50:14.026 --> 02:50:16.228]  I'm in bed by 9 o'clock at night.
[02:50:16.228 --> 02:50:18.911]  So I'm just telling you, there is a real war, okay?
[02:50:20.865 --> 02:50:23.367]  Whatever they cook up, I don't even worry if they kill me, whatever.
[02:50:23.367 --> 02:50:25.108]  It just matters you continue moving on.
[02:50:25.108 --> 02:50:27.410]  We're going to win because this is pure evil.
[02:50:27.410 --> 02:50:32.794]  And we can't turn future generations over to this because they'll do what they did in Communist China killing 85 million people.
[02:50:32.794 --> 02:50:36.076]  Or killing tens of millions of Christians and others in Russia and surrounding areas.
[02:50:36.076 --> 02:50:37.037]  That's what they like!
[02:50:37.757 --> 02:50:48.505]  If Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton get full control, pissing on us and strangling us politically and spiritually and having our children and just feeding on good people is what these vampires do.
[02:50:48.505 --> 02:50:50.006]  This is a cult of evil.
[02:50:50.006 --> 02:50:55.810]  It's a French Revolution Jacobin system I've had top historians on, economists, you name it, they all agree.
[02:50:55.810 --> 02:50:58.152]  It is a Jacobin spirit.
[02:50:58.152 --> 02:51:01.194]  So we've got seven minutes left of this segment, then one more with our guest.
[02:51:01.194 --> 02:51:02.195]  He's an amazing guest.
[02:51:02.195 --> 02:51:05.357]  I'm glad Daria got him on the show.
[02:51:05.357 --> 02:51:06.058]  Yes, out of
[02:51:06.178 --> 02:51:07.199]  We have 100 plus people here.
[02:51:07.199 --> 02:51:11.582]  We have one evil Russian, who I'm proud to have here, whose family moved over here.
[02:51:11.582 --> 02:51:15.985]  We're anti-communist and she's worked for our military at the highest levels of the army.
[02:51:15.985 --> 02:51:21.489]  She doesn't want me to get into that, but she's not trusted either, even though she's been in special operations and all of it.
[02:51:21.489 --> 02:51:22.550]  No, she's a great asset.
[02:51:22.550 --> 02:51:24.572]  We're proud to have a Russian working here.
[02:51:24.572 --> 02:51:25.873]  She's one of our best crew members.
[02:51:25.873 --> 02:51:27.254]  We'd be proud to have more.
[02:51:27.254 --> 02:51:31.397]  But again, I'm not going to let all this Russia-phobia thing manipulate me.
[02:51:32.117 --> 02:51:33.498]  I think so.
[02:51:49.686 --> 02:51:59.608]  Yes, so tomorrow at Washington, Ksenia Sobchak will deliver a speech at one of the major think tanks related to Georgetown Institute.
[02:51:59.608 --> 02:52:14.412]  So, the thing is that Vladimir Putin didn't destroy all the globalists here in Russia because, well, technically it's impossible if you do this in the framework of rights and in the framework of
[02:52:15.092 --> 02:52:19.716]  A society that respects the rights and the freedoms that Russia is now.
[02:52:19.716 --> 02:52:24.620]  We have the freedom of speech, we have the freedom of religion, we have the freedom of possession.
[02:52:24.620 --> 02:52:31.326]  So, I mean, it's not always you can catch them by hand and take them to jail.
[02:52:31.326 --> 02:52:40.353]  They claim Russia's persecuting everybody, which isn't true, but the left's calling for all of us to be banned, and Germany's arresting people that criticize the government.
[02:52:40.353 --> 02:52:41.995]  They're the ones censoring, not Putin!
[02:52:43.672 --> 02:52:51.017]  Yes, definitely, and I can tell you as a Russian journalist that we have all the spectrum of opinions in major media.
[02:52:51.017 --> 02:52:54.659]  We have major federal channels sponsored and funded.
[02:52:54.659 --> 02:52:58.162]  But correct me if I'm wrong, just no one foreign funded, which is totally reasonable.
[02:52:59.688 --> 02:53:20.612]  Yes, and I can also tell you that, to my mind, the only reason why globalists work so hard to block US and Trump and Trump supporters from being in better relations with Russia is because Russian experience is the key to success of Trump team and Trump supporters.
[02:53:20.612 --> 02:53:28.674]  Because Vladimir Putin and his supporters here in Russia, that are 80, more than like 82% now, according to sociologists, support Vladimir Putin.
[02:53:28.934 --> 02:53:29.634]  Exactly.
[02:53:29.634 --> 02:53:31.014]  Putin delivered a recovery.
[02:53:31.014 --> 02:53:32.015]  Trump does it.
[02:53:32.015 --> 02:53:33.875]  Nationalism family's back.
[02:53:33.875 --> 02:53:34.515]  And we win.
[02:53:34.515 --> 02:53:38.656]  And the whole nightmare doesn't have to happen like you went through.
[02:53:38.656 --> 02:53:39.056]  Definitely.
[02:53:39.056 --> 02:53:43.617]  So, Alex, I just want to ask, as a journalist, it's really interesting for me.
[02:53:43.617 --> 02:53:50.978]  I want to ask you, how come a representative of globalists like Ksenia Savchak goes to U.S.?
[02:53:50.978 --> 02:53:53.699]  It makes me, I mean, it's... I was about to say, she's here.
[02:53:54.099 --> 02:53:58.383]  She's here right now to launch the National Press Club, her operation.
[02:53:58.383 --> 02:54:02.927]  I mean, imagine if Trump went to Russia to launch his campaign.
[02:54:02.927 --> 02:54:05.329]  This is incredibly revealing.
[02:54:05.329 --> 02:54:07.431]  Putin rival comes to the U.S.
[02:54:07.431 --> 02:54:12.476]  to the Trump prayer breakfast, invited in so that they can somehow try to embarrass Trump.
[02:54:14.528 --> 02:54:37.144]  Definitely and I can tell you that as a candidate for presidency and you know that we're now in a state of a presidential campaign and we have elections in March, it's really disappointing because usually Russia is blamed for meddling and for trying to influence some kind of elections in any country.
[02:54:37.144 --> 02:54:40.286]  That's absolute nonsense and I as a journalist have
[02:54:40.766 --> 02:54:49.749]  Soros said he spent 5 billion dollars to overthrow Ukraine and is actually trying to... No, I watched Fareed Zakaria.
[02:54:49.749 --> 02:54:54.190]  They go, we're trying to overthrow Russia and then Russia, I look, is doing nothing.
[02:54:54.190 --> 02:54:55.451]  I don't see any Russian action.
[02:54:55.451 --> 02:54:56.591]  The bots are all fake.
[02:54:56.591 --> 02:54:57.351]  Exactly.
[02:54:57.351 --> 02:55:03.073]  She's over here being funded by the globalists to try to overthrow a country they want to gang-rape some more.
[02:55:03.073 --> 02:55:06.534]  And while they're upset, we might get out of their grips as well.
[02:55:08.863 --> 02:55:20.145]  Definitely, and it's a pity because for ordinary Americans that are not so deep enough into politics, she will be the representative of Russian people.
[02:55:20.145 --> 02:55:21.405]  That is not true.
[02:55:21.405 --> 02:55:26.706]  She does not represent the majority, just like globalists do not represent the real Americans.
[02:55:26.706 --> 02:55:28.447]  And I know she's all cleaned up now.
[02:55:28.447 --> 02:55:30.387]  She's not dressed like a prostitute now.
[02:55:30.387 --> 02:55:32.927]  She's wearing more of a business suit outfit.
[02:55:32.927 --> 02:55:34.408]  What's her family background though?
[02:55:34.408 --> 02:55:35.548]  I heard her dad was pro-Putin.
[02:55:37.393 --> 02:55:48.382]  Well, it's not that he was pro-Putin, but back in the 90s they worked together, and then Vladimir Putin changed his opinion, I think.
[02:55:48.382 --> 02:56:00.351]  As a journalist, it's my personal opinion, because, well, in the 90s there was no other choice, and Vladimir Putin and his policies were a reaction to what happened in the 90s.
[02:56:01.294 --> 02:56:14.418]  Sure, I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, you had foreign outside powers like we have with the globalists, same people, controlling your nation, trying to keep it poor to control it, and Putin wanted prosperity and a Russian revival.
[02:56:14.418 --> 02:56:18.859]  Yes, definitely, but you must understand that even though Russia is now maybe the most
[02:56:20.482 --> 02:56:28.406]  Non-globalist and clan from globalist countries still, a lot of people, especially in Alex, share these views.
[02:56:28.406 --> 02:56:31.848]  And we have a lot of networks... Oh, you're totally infested!
[02:56:31.848 --> 02:56:36.611]  In fact, Soros admits that tens of billions have been spent trying to overthrow Russia.
[02:56:36.611 --> 02:56:38.632]  That's public!
[02:56:38.632 --> 02:56:40.072]  But they just think Americans are ignorant.
[02:56:40.072 --> 02:56:48.397]  How much do you know, that we know, has the US, the captured US, the Soros Combine spent trying to overthrow Russia?
[02:56:49.890 --> 02:57:07.405]  Definitely, these numbers are billions, and we must understand that the numbers that you named are just the official numbers that go through white accounting, and we know that there are a lot of black money, like CIA money, that they usually get from criminal operations.
[02:57:07.605 --> 02:57:13.388]  And we know the globalists have hijacked the CIA, but there's a lot of CIA that doesn't like what's happening, is actually pro-national and sovereign.
[02:57:13.388 --> 02:57:14.228]  That's why they're so scared.
[02:57:14.228 --> 02:57:20.591]  We'll come back from break and talk about the civil war inside the intelligence agencies on the other side.
[02:57:20.591 --> 02:57:22.472]  This is incredibly important information.
[02:57:22.472 --> 02:57:27.615]  Again, one of the top journalists, top political analysts, big national TV shows in Russia is our guest.
[02:57:28.296 --> 02:57:31.199]  Andre Afanasyev will join us on the other side.
[02:57:31.199 --> 02:57:34.123]  We'll put some of his websites on screen for TV viewers.
[02:57:34.123 --> 02:57:40.892]  But actually, hearing from the Russians of the renaissance that's happened and why Hollywood hates them like a passion.
[02:57:40.892 --> 02:57:42.434]  Just like they hate flyover country.
[02:57:42.434 --> 02:57:44.157]  They hate Christians, period.
[02:57:45.700 --> 02:57:50.344]  Support good oral health with our one-of-a-kind super blue fluoride free products.
[02:57:50.344 --> 02:57:58.010]  InfoWars Life brings you a revolutionary toothpaste blend with iodine and nano silver designed to deliver a powerful clean.
[02:57:58.010 --> 02:58:02.234]  Enjoy a minty fresh flavor made with peppermint oil or try our bubblegum flavor.
[02:58:02.234 --> 02:58:08.199]  Pair this groundbreaking toothpaste with the super blue fluoride free mouthwash and supercharge your oral health.

[02:58:25.230 --> 02:58:32.134]  Our Super Blue Fluoride-Free Mouthwash and Toothpaste are the first and only to contain all of these natural ingredients.
[02:58:32.134 --> 02:58:35.016]  Xylitol, Nano Silver, and Iodine.

[02:59:49.258 --> 02:59:56.203]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:56.203 --> 03:00:02.927]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:02.927 --> 03:00:07.450]  Andrei Avanazyev is our guest for two more segments than Doug Hagman's taking over.
[03:00:07.450 --> 03:00:09.872]  In fact, partway in the next segment, here in about 12 minutes.
[03:00:11.047 --> 03:00:31.297]  But I know you're a geopolitical scientist, political scientist, host of some big national TV shows in Russia, obviously a smart guy, because you can speak English, I can't speak Russian, and I've watched you, and I've read your material, and I'm not really a Russophile, I'll be honest, not an Anglophile either, I'm kind of a Renaissance Americophile, but I see a Renaissance in Russia,
[03:00:32.097 --> 03:00:41.643]  As Trump has said, and they demonize him as being a Russian agent, for saying, hey, I admire the success, the nationalism, the turning things around, despite all the sanctions.
[03:00:41.643 --> 03:00:42.984]  In this little short segment, the next.
[03:00:44.099 --> 03:00:47.563]  Alexander Shultz and Putin claims he liked some of the writings.
[03:00:47.563 --> 03:00:52.069]  I ended up not just reading Gulag Archipelago, but three other books that he translated into English.
[03:00:52.069 --> 03:00:56.895]  And it just seemed like pure veritas for my own experiences in life and historical research.
[03:00:56.895 --> 03:01:01.681]  So what got Putin, I know he's an underground Christian, his family still practiced it and everything.
[03:01:02.262 --> 03:01:06.485]  But talking about the transformation, how did they not see Putin?
[03:01:06.485 --> 03:01:07.666]  How did this happen?
[03:01:07.666 --> 03:01:09.647]  Because the proof's in the pudding.
[03:01:09.647 --> 03:01:16.531]  How did this unfold to where Putin has been the preeminent world leader for at least a decade?
[03:01:16.531 --> 03:01:22.835]  Trump admits that and sees that, and now that he's become nationalist, boom, he's right there with Putin, maybe even in a year already eclipsing that.
[03:01:22.835 --> 03:01:26.277]  Notice they still haven't met, though, in their own big summit.
[03:01:26.277 --> 03:01:28.359]  I think Trump should meet and break it all.
[03:01:28.979 --> 03:01:31.320]  Well, first of all, Vladimir Putin is a Russian patriot.
[03:01:52.452 --> 03:01:58.856]  He loves Russia and does everything to make our country secure.
[03:01:58.856 --> 03:02:05.600]  It doesn't mean that he executes some kind of aggressive policies.
[03:02:05.600 --> 03:02:09.102]  First of all, Russia does not need it, but we need to defend ourselves.
[03:02:09.902 --> 03:02:16.344]  For example, usually the West says that Russia annexed Crimea.
[03:02:16.344 --> 03:02:17.884]  That's absolutely not true.
[03:02:17.884 --> 03:02:33.429]  Because in Ukraine, in late 2013, globalists launched a pro-EU, pro-Western, pro-globalist, pro-NATO coup to overthrow the legally, legitimately elected government.
[03:02:33.429 --> 03:02:34.149]  And they succeeded.
[03:02:35.633 --> 03:02:48.963]  This coup brought to power ultra-right Nazis controlled and funded by Soros and groups related to him.
[03:02:48.963 --> 03:02:55.347]  And these people say that they are Ukrainians and they have nothing to do with Russians.
[03:02:55.347 --> 03:03:00.731]  And Crimea was the most Russian region of ex-Ukraine.
[03:03:01.838 --> 03:03:13.805]  So, the first thing they started doing is sending special radical terrorist groups to provocate and put under control Crimea.
[03:03:13.805 --> 03:03:19.268]  Because you know under the... Same deal, they were shooting cops, burning things down.
[03:03:19.268 --> 03:03:21.009]  Same thing India does, but much worse.
[03:03:21.009 --> 03:03:22.250]  Definitely.
[03:03:22.250 --> 03:03:24.632]  So, Ukraine was a neutral country.
[03:03:24.632 --> 03:03:27.513]  It wasn't so pro-globalist or pro-nationalist.
[03:03:27.513 --> 03:03:30.255]  It was just a country in between Russia and EU.
[03:03:30.974 --> 03:03:34.036]  But, I mean, it appeared thanks to Bolsheviks.
[03:03:34.036 --> 03:03:37.819]  Bolsheviks created it, because there was no Ukraine before 1970.
[03:03:37.819 --> 03:03:40.040]  It used to be part of Russia.
[03:03:40.040 --> 03:03:55.431]  Yes, it was just part of Russia, and Bolsheviks wanted to make the revolution global, and for that they needed to show to peoples of the world that... Well, sure, they could break pieces off from Russia itself and then play games there.
[03:03:56.171 --> 03:03:58.892]  They just put Russia into parts and that's it.
[03:03:58.892 --> 03:04:06.395]  So, Vladimir Putin is just a person that wants security for our people.
[03:04:06.395 --> 03:04:13.958]  So, I mean, if you have a globalist and pro-Soros coup d'etat in a neighboring country,
[03:04:14.987 --> 03:04:16.989]  And, I mean, what would you do?
[03:04:16.989 --> 03:04:24.154]  And if part of this country says, all right, this government is not legitimate, we've held a referendum and want to join you.
[03:04:24.154 --> 03:04:25.515]  Please defend us.
[03:04:25.515 --> 03:04:26.316]  What would you do?
[03:04:26.316 --> 03:04:36.404]  Well, stay there, because it's the same thing happened in the 2000s and the 90s, where the Clintons attacked Serbia multiple times, bombed the South.
[03:04:36.404 --> 03:04:40.047]  It was going to be like Texas, Louisiana, right up into Indiana.
[03:04:40.447 --> 03:04:52.159]  They take a third of the country, give it to Muslims who invade out of Albania, who engage in ethnic cleansing, and then finally Russia landed, and they were going to take the whole country, and Pristina, and said, no further, and they said that was aggression.
[03:04:52.159 --> 03:04:54.461]  Now they're going to turn the whole Christian country over and kill everybody.
[03:04:55.526 --> 03:04:56.326]  I'm so excited.
[03:04:56.326 --> 03:05:06.468]  The new product at m4warslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[03:05:06.468 --> 03:05:11.989]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[03:05:11.989 --> 03:05:14.990]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[03:05:14.990 --> 03:05:23.772]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[03:05:25.865 --> 03:05:34.069]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[03:05:34.069 --> 03:05:45.455]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[03:05:45.455 --> 03:05:48.136]  It is amazing!
[03:05:48.136 --> 03:05:53.119]  Red Pilt, now available at InfoWarsTore.com and your purchase fugs the operation.
[03:06:00.026 --> 03:06:04.110]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:06:04.110 --> 03:06:06.872]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:06.872 --> 03:06:10.575]  You can run on for a long time.
[03:06:10.575 --> 03:06:13.518]  Run on for a long time.
[03:06:13.518 --> 03:06:15.660]  Run on for a long time.
[03:06:15.660 --> 03:06:19.363]  Sooner or later, they're gonna cut you down.
[03:06:19.363 --> 03:06:23.147]  Sooner or later, they're gonna... Well, the always amazing Doug Hagman, who we're gonna be
[03:06:24.019 --> 03:06:26.000]  Syndicating very, very soon on radio and TV.
[03:06:26.000 --> 03:06:28.022]  He's already got a viral program.
[03:06:28.022 --> 03:06:29.382]  Been interviewing him for more than a decade.
[03:06:29.382 --> 03:06:31.764]  He's going to be taken over here in about 10 minutes.
[03:06:31.764 --> 03:06:34.246]  We have Andrey Afanasyev joining us.
[03:06:34.246 --> 03:06:51.957]  He's a big national TV host in Russia, and who is exposing that multinational megabanks, just like McCarthy said, that's when he classified him of the Russians, he was right, funded communism as a way to con the serfs of Europe
[03:06:52.978 --> 03:07:02.800]  And Russia, from one agrarian system that had some controls that I would call authoritarian, but they were really just ancient, on to a new system of total control.
[03:07:02.800 --> 03:07:04.341]  And they all bragged about this.
[03:07:04.341 --> 03:07:05.701]  And they did it.
[03:07:05.701 --> 03:07:13.823]  And scholars, you know, we're talking, I don't want to say Nobel Prize winners, that's embarrassing now, you know, people like Alexander Solzhenitsyn reverse engineered all this, but
[03:07:14.483 --> 03:07:18.769]  It, before Solzhenitsyn, before I even read his books, I had reverse engineered it.
[03:07:18.769 --> 03:07:22.554]  Because, and I'm not putting him down, I'm saying it's true.
[03:07:22.554 --> 03:07:24.917]  I didn't read it from Solzhenitsyn, I read that and learned more.
[03:07:26.002 --> 03:07:35.545]  That the exact crap you see at the universities and everywhere else, and the MSNBC saying you can't have churches or families, they said that to Trump!
[03:07:35.545 --> 03:07:37.165]  You don't get that!
[03:07:37.165 --> 03:07:40.346]  They had a woman on TV going, you don't get that!
[03:07:40.346 --> 03:07:44.407]  These are commissars that are going to stand over us as political officers and gang rapists.
[03:07:45.410 --> 03:07:57.002]  And so, in closing, I want you to get back into how they're allied with radical Islam, these globalists, how we defeat them, concerns you've got, and I know we don't want to be critical overall.
[03:07:57.002 --> 03:08:00.425]  Trump has enemies, you know him by his enemies.
[03:08:00.425 --> 03:08:05.931]  He's trying, but they have bullied him into accelerating conflict with Russia.
[03:08:07.212 --> 03:08:10.754]  Threatening huge new sanctions and Putin just says, well that's not very friendly.
[03:08:10.754 --> 03:08:13.015]  As it was, Russia helped us right after 9-11.
[03:08:13.015 --> 03:08:15.757]  Russia helped us take out ISIS more than we did.
[03:08:15.757 --> 03:08:17.758]  It's not like groveling to Russia.
[03:08:17.758 --> 03:08:19.560]  I've never been there.
[03:08:19.560 --> 03:08:20.800]  It's the truth!
[03:08:20.800 --> 03:08:32.808]  And then to sit there and watch Hollywood and these Bolsheviks piss all over everybody and then sit there and just kind of, oh get a brownie point, you know, so I don't get called a Russian agent by not talking to Russians.
[03:08:32.808 --> 03:08:33.649]  I'm not doing it.
[03:08:33.649 --> 03:08:33.949]  I'm not
[03:08:34.229 --> 03:08:34.729]  Thank you very much.
[03:08:55.379 --> 03:09:06.184]  Yes, Alex, so definitely we're now in a situation where Donald Trump somehow needs to fight for area, fight for space, because he is surrounded.
[03:09:06.184 --> 03:09:09.746]  Just like Vladimir Putin was surrounded in 1999.
[03:09:09.746 --> 03:09:17.990]  He came to power in a country that was totally controlled by transnational corporations and liberal structures.
[03:09:17.990 --> 03:09:21.992]  For example, all our natural resources, oil and gas,
[03:09:22.832 --> 03:09:26.916]  were not owned by the state or by state-run companies.
[03:09:26.916 --> 03:09:29.718]  They are all owned by transnational companies.
[03:09:29.718 --> 03:09:34.261]  And it took about four years to take it back.
[03:09:34.261 --> 03:09:41.347]  Can you imagine that all the oil of the United States, all the Texan oil, is owned by, I don't know, a Dutch company?
[03:09:41.347 --> 03:09:43.548]  It's the state of my country.
[03:09:43.548 --> 03:09:44.209]  I remember it.
[03:09:44.209 --> 03:09:46.811]  It was like 13 years ago.
[03:09:47.674 --> 03:09:50.495]  So, and it took time.
[03:09:50.495 --> 03:09:53.156]  It took time to fight these networks.
[03:09:53.156 --> 03:09:59.578]  And, for example, the famous Munich speech of Vladimir Putin at Munich Conference.
[03:09:59.578 --> 03:10:05.720]  It was the first challenge of globalism from a national leader of a big country.
[03:10:05.720 --> 03:10:09.862]  Happened seven years after Putin came into office.
[03:10:09.862 --> 03:10:15.904]  So we definitely need the second office for Donald, the second term for Donald Trump team.
[03:10:16.545 --> 03:10:21.751]  Because it took us, Russians, seven years to start the process.
[03:10:21.751 --> 03:10:27.918]  And by the way, now the dominoes are falling, so Russia deserves the credit for kicking the dominoes over, and the globalists admit that.
[03:10:27.918 --> 03:10:29.960]  That's not refuted, and they say it with horror.
[03:10:29.960 --> 03:10:33.004]  You got cut off by a brick 30 minutes ago, I'm glad you mentioned that.
[03:10:33.004 --> 03:10:36.568]  What about the meeting, the picnic with the oligarchs early on?
[03:10:38.260 --> 03:11:07.126]  Yes, so it was a famous meeting with oligarchs, like maybe a year after Putin came into power, and he declared officially and openly to them the new rules, saying that all the major businessmen, oligarchs as we say, need to become national and work for the interest of the state, or if they keep on being globalists, the state will need to defend itself and the people
[03:11:08.583 --> 03:11:17.011]  So, the majority of them fled to London and to other countries, but the majority of them are in London, like Boris Berezovsky.
[03:11:17.011 --> 03:11:21.275]  Some of them fled to Israel, like Mr. Gusinsky.
[03:11:21.275 --> 03:11:27.360]  And I can tell you that all of them, it's funny, they all owned major media in the country.
[03:11:27.360 --> 03:11:31.184]  Berezovsky owned First Channel, it's like CNN.
[03:11:32.290 --> 03:11:37.813]  And there were also lawsuits.
[03:11:37.813 --> 03:11:40.414]  It turned out a bunch of them were fronts for the Rothschilds.
[03:11:40.414 --> 03:11:48.418]  The Rothschilds sued, and then in court the judges said, no, it turns out the Rothschilds have been running Russia for 80 years.
[03:11:48.418 --> 03:11:49.359]  Yeah, definitely.
[03:11:49.359 --> 03:11:54.021]  And still, for example, our central bank does not report to our government.
[03:11:54.784 --> 03:11:58.568]  And it's a big problem because the globalists are doing everything.
[03:11:58.568 --> 03:11:59.449]  That's key.
[03:11:59.449 --> 03:12:04.095]  You're saying 18 years later Russia still hasn't drained the swamp fully?
[03:12:04.095 --> 03:12:07.098]  We're still one foot in the swamp.
[03:12:07.098 --> 03:12:10.963]  We have our army, we have our special services, we have
[03:12:12.593 --> 03:12:25.796]  I was about to say next, it's funny because I was always critical of our special services and it was infiltrated and run by bad guys.
[03:12:25.796 --> 03:12:28.616]  But it was in this last election, they saw it was all real.
[03:12:28.616 --> 03:12:33.857]  It was the military, it was good elements of the CIA and other agencies that actually got the intel out.
[03:12:33.857 --> 03:12:35.638]  WikiLeaks, it wasn't the Russians.
[03:12:35.638 --> 03:12:36.298]  And all of it
[03:12:36.798 --> 03:12:45.425]  And actually that's now the main line with Trump is the military, particularly the Army and the Marine Corps now, against the globalists to return the country.
[03:12:45.425 --> 03:12:52.371]  It's not that they're perfect, they just think America should run America, we're not going to use it to fund world government, we're not going to be used like Russia to do all this.
[03:12:52.371 --> 03:12:53.852]  I mean, they use that as an example.
[03:12:53.852 --> 03:12:54.673]  They know.
[03:12:54.673 --> 03:13:00.258]  How can they ever go back now, Andre, now that the cat's out of the bag, now that the program's out?
[03:13:01.738 --> 03:13:18.893]  Well, Alex, the main objective for all of us, for all the people here in Russia, for all of you fellow Americans who support nationalism and tradition and Christianity is installing public relations with each other.
[03:13:19.497 --> 03:13:20.578]  Without globalists.
[03:13:20.578 --> 03:13:24.540]  We need to create our own networks to deliver truth.
[03:13:24.540 --> 03:13:31.083]  I am like ultra-imperialist, in a good way, Russian, who supports Russian Empire.
[03:13:31.083 --> 03:13:34.925]  And I tell you Americans, please, be sovereign and strong.
[03:13:34.925 --> 03:13:36.606]  I don't tell you, be weak.
[03:13:36.606 --> 03:13:38.487]  I don't tell you that we want to conquer you.
[03:13:38.487 --> 03:13:45.631]  I tell you, be strong and defend your national interests and not the interests of a bunch of globalist oligarchs.
[03:13:46.071 --> 03:13:46.892]  That's the difference.
[03:13:46.892 --> 03:13:48.213]  We all need to be strong.
[03:13:48.213 --> 03:13:50.476]  We all need to defend our national interests.
[03:13:50.476 --> 03:13:53.799]  It doesn't mean that Russia and U.S.
[03:13:53.799 --> 03:14:06.512]  always have the same interests, but we need to discuss them as national sovereign countries and not as different departments of a big transnational corporation.
[03:14:06.512 --> 03:14:08.815]  That's how they want to see us.
[03:14:09.355 --> 03:14:12.178]  And by the way, I watch... I watch America to be strong.
[03:14:12.178 --> 03:14:12.699]  Absolutely.
[03:14:12.699 --> 03:14:15.481]  I watch some of the Putin speeches and things.
[03:14:15.481 --> 03:14:16.883]  And he says the same thing.
[03:14:16.883 --> 03:14:17.423]  Be strong.
[03:14:17.423 --> 03:14:18.545]  Take your country back.
[03:14:18.545 --> 03:14:20.206]  And once you do, we want to do business with you.
[03:14:20.206 --> 03:14:21.167]  We have a lot of resources.
[03:14:21.167 --> 03:14:23.209]  We're ready for business.
[03:14:23.209 --> 03:14:27.013]  It sounds like John Wayne saying, let's do business.
[03:14:27.013 --> 03:14:28.235]  And let's be Christian.
[03:14:28.235 --> 03:14:29.696]  And that's what pisses off Hollywood.
[03:14:29.696 --> 03:14:31.438]  It's so obvious.
[03:14:31.438 --> 03:14:32.259]  Andre, it's sick.
[03:14:33.871 --> 03:14:35.172]  Well, definitely.
[03:14:35.172 --> 03:14:41.914]  And the more we talk about that, the more we expose them, both here in Russia, we still have a lot of problems.
[03:14:41.914 --> 03:14:44.656]  You see, Ksenia Sobchak is coming to Washington.
[03:14:44.656 --> 03:14:47.937]  You have your own problems, but I noticed that they said, oh, Putin really wanted Hillary.
[03:14:47.937 --> 03:14:49.278]  Well, he hedged his bets.
[03:14:49.278 --> 03:14:50.998]  I watched the Duma when Trump won.
[03:14:50.998 --> 03:14:52.459]  People were crying.
[03:14:52.459 --> 03:14:53.800]  They were celebrating.
[03:14:53.800 --> 03:14:54.540]  That's what I saw.
[03:14:55.894 --> 03:14:58.719]  But we were happy not because Trump is a Russian agent.
[03:14:58.719 --> 03:15:09.316]  We were happy because Trump was a chance for us that globalists that control the United States would leave us alone and let us live the lives we want to live.
[03:15:09.316 --> 03:15:10.318]  And that's the point.
[03:15:11.425 --> 03:15:20.030]  Well, that's right, and my God, I couldn't imagine how many Russians and Ukrainians and Poles did that the leftists took control from the U.S.
[03:15:20.030 --> 03:15:20.330]  kill.
[03:15:20.330 --> 03:15:28.575]  I mean, I actually feel like we should apologize to Russia, even though I wasn't alive then, that America let the leftists come over there and gang-rape the hell out of you.
[03:15:28.575 --> 03:15:32.657]  Well, unfortunately, it was also made on American money, on the globalist money.
[03:15:32.657 --> 03:15:36.660]  We know that Trotsky came to Russia from New York, where he has relatives.
[03:15:37.401 --> 03:15:37.801]  That's right.
[03:15:37.801 --> 03:15:39.403]  It's all historic now.
[03:15:39.403 --> 03:15:40.404]  They run the neocons.
[03:15:40.404 --> 03:15:42.726]  We're all going to come together though to defeat this.
[03:15:42.726 --> 03:15:45.388]  All right, Andrei Avinasiev, thank you.
[03:15:45.388 --> 03:15:49.551]  Come back on David Knight, on any of the shows, any of the broadcasts.
[03:15:49.551 --> 03:15:51.433]  We want to have you on with the War Room, you name it.
[03:15:51.433 --> 03:15:52.254]  Very powerful truth.
[03:15:53.854 --> 03:15:58.976]  The answer to being in control of your own health care is freedom from insurance.
[03:15:58.976 --> 03:16:04.679]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's medical expenses.

[03:16:15.144 --> 03:16:18.446]  Discount programs available for dental, vision, and pharmacy.

[03:17:59.237 --> 03:18:07.320]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestive process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[03:18:07.320 --> 03:18:12.623]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[03:18:12.623 --> 03:18:15.144]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[03:18:15.144 --> 03:18:19.366]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[03:18:19.366 --> 03:18:21.807]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[03:18:22.487 --> 03:18:29.732]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.
[03:18:29.732 --> 03:18:37.798]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[03:18:37.798 --> 03:18:44.983]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates, so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[03:18:44.983 --> 03:18:46.444]  Don't let a meal go to waste.

[03:18:58.351 --> 03:19:09.838]  We have found extraordinary new natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory health and normal breathing.
[03:19:09.838 --> 03:19:10.759]  This is Pollen Block.
[03:19:11.759 --> 03:19:24.412]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs from specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like runny nose, itchy watery eyes, and excessive mucus production.
[03:19:24.412 --> 03:19:28.737]  They began studying the effects in published trials.
[03:19:28.737 --> 03:19:32.761]  Now we are introducing the fruit of the research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet
[03:19:33.201 --> 03:19:43.308]  Just chew two tablets at the first sign of seasonal distress and Fast-Acting Pollen Block starts working in about 15 minutes to help alleviate seasonal distress.

[03:19:50.573 --> 03:19:53.675]  888-253-3139 You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:10.236 --> 03:20:17.542]  Welcome back, it's Doug Hagman, syndicated TV and radio host, incredible intel source there on the East Coast.
[03:20:17.542 --> 03:20:27.791]  The President giving a speech at one of the new factories that's expanding here in the United States as we see record acceleration of our economy after just a few of the globalist constraints have been removed.
[03:20:27.791 --> 03:20:31.334]  Talking about we have them, we have them now, we've caught them with a memo.
[03:20:32.254 --> 03:20:34.375]  Five new memos coming out as we told you.
[03:20:34.375 --> 03:20:36.256]  This is just the blueprint of the treason.
[03:20:36.256 --> 03:20:37.676]  Then we get them to lie in the media.
[03:20:37.676 --> 03:20:41.078]  Then we release the new information exposing them.
[03:20:41.078 --> 03:20:42.478]  Not that we're masterminds.
[03:20:42.478 --> 03:20:45.259]  The 5-D chess is we're not lying.
[03:20:45.259 --> 03:20:47.500]  The 5-D chess is we mean well.
[03:20:47.500 --> 03:20:50.001]  The 5-D chess is we're not out to screw you.
[03:20:50.001 --> 03:20:51.321]  And these criminals never get that.
[03:20:51.321 --> 03:20:53.042]  They think they're so smart being criminals.
[03:20:53.042 --> 03:20:55.783]  They don't get just being straight shooting is what built America.
[03:20:55.783 --> 03:20:56.844]  And not being cowards.
[03:20:56.844 --> 03:20:57.564]  So here's the president.
[03:20:59.961 --> 03:21:01.802]  I think everybody's going to be supportive.
[03:21:01.802 --> 03:21:08.125]  We need people that are going to do a great job and keep us in the right direction.
[03:21:08.125 --> 03:21:10.826]  We need them badly, too.
[03:21:10.826 --> 03:21:14.727]  Or it all goes back to where it was and worse.
[03:21:14.727 --> 03:21:17.068]  Oh, but did we catch them in the act or what?
[03:21:17.068 --> 03:21:18.129]  You know what I'm talking about.
[03:21:18.129 --> 03:21:20.770]  Oh, did we catch them in the act?
[03:21:20.770 --> 03:21:23.231]  They are very embarrassed.
[03:21:23.231 --> 03:21:25.152]  They never thought they were going to get caught.
[03:21:25.152 --> 03:21:25.752]  We caught them.
[03:21:28.243 --> 03:21:39.875]  Hey, we caught him on so much fun, but like the great sleuth.
[03:21:39.875 --> 03:21:42.057]  Nothing succeeds like success.
[03:21:42.057 --> 03:21:43.598]  I'm going to turn this over to Doug Hagman.
[03:21:43.598 --> 03:21:45.100]  I appreciate hosting this hour.
[03:21:45.100 --> 03:21:48.904]  We had that incredible guest that ran over, but I can't wait to hear what he has to say.
[03:21:48.904 --> 03:21:50.946]  We're not out of the woods yet, but let me tell you something.
[03:21:52.110 --> 03:21:54.892]  We were getting our ass handed to us, they're getting their ass handed to them right now.
[03:21:54.892 --> 03:21:58.574]  As long as we continue to move forward with that spirit, we are unstoppable.
[03:21:58.574 --> 03:22:00.476]  Doug Hagman, what you got coming up today for us?
[03:22:01.550 --> 03:22:06.031]  I'm going to lay out some info that we have not heard yet.
[03:22:06.031 --> 03:22:09.812]  The difference between Title I and Section 702.
[03:22:09.812 --> 03:22:11.272]  Donald Trump saying that we got them.
[03:22:11.272 --> 03:22:12.852]  Boy, do we ever have them.
[03:22:12.852 --> 03:22:15.373]  And it's worse than people really believe.
[03:22:15.373 --> 03:22:17.773]  So, I'm going to break this down.
[03:22:17.773 --> 03:22:20.294]  Also, the five different memos you're talking about.
[03:22:20.294 --> 03:22:21.774]  Get into that a little bit more.
[03:22:21.774 --> 03:22:22.954]  Information packed.
[03:22:22.954 --> 03:22:25.355]  Just looking forward to the next few segments.
[03:22:26.798 --> 03:22:29.105]  Doug, let's talk about the President's statement then.
[03:22:29.105 --> 03:22:30.349]  We have you now.
[03:22:30.349 --> 03:22:33.719]  Let's discuss where that goes and how they may strike back.
[03:22:33.719 --> 03:22:34.361]  Take over, my friend.
[03:22:35.955 --> 03:22:39.857]  All right, thanks Alex, and I appreciate the opportunity to sit for you.
[03:22:39.857 --> 03:22:44.279]  I'm going to tell everyone right now, look, the evidence is undeniable.
[03:22:44.279 --> 03:22:50.281]  The Nunez memo that was released last Friday, of course, is just the start, just the tip of the iceberg.
[03:22:50.281 --> 03:22:58.025]  Because what is coming next, the documentation, the foundational documents for that executive summary that we saw.
[03:22:58.738 --> 03:23:08.186]  is going to be so damning, so critical, so... it will infuriate even, I believe, even members of the left of center.
[03:23:08.186 --> 03:23:10.088]  That's how bad this is.
[03:23:10.088 --> 03:23:23.560]  This is an attempted takeover, as Alex has said, as David Niners, as everyone has said, this is an attempted takeover of our country, of our Constitution, not just the President, not just the Office of the Presidency.
[03:23:24.060 --> 03:23:28.325]  But of every one of us to reverse the election and also to install the globalists.
[03:23:28.325 --> 03:23:34.071]  Now if you listen to the last hour with Andre from Russia, so much important information there.
[03:23:34.071 --> 03:23:38.675]  And how this all ties together because at the root of everything it's the globalists.
[03:23:38.675 --> 03:23:43.020]  It's the people who are attempting to manufacture and orchestrate
[03:23:43.640 --> 03:23:49.762]  And whether through warfare or, I mean, bombs, bullets or ink.
[03:23:49.762 --> 03:23:55.425]  It used to be ink, I guess, but now the excitement of electrons over the airwaves.
[03:23:55.425 --> 03:23:58.986]  What we're seeing is now the pushback against the orchestration.
[03:23:59.686 --> 03:24:01.367]  Of the globalists.
[03:24:01.367 --> 03:24:03.107]  And now it's all coming apart.
[03:24:03.107 --> 03:24:06.268]  The wheels are coming off their globalist bus.
[03:24:06.268 --> 03:24:10.809]  Soros is driving in the globalist bus and the wheels are coming right off.
[03:24:10.809 --> 03:24:12.850]  I mean, you get that?
[03:24:12.850 --> 03:24:13.730]  And we're winning.
[03:24:13.730 --> 03:24:14.550]  We are winning.
[03:24:14.550 --> 03:24:17.511]  And that's a good thing.
[03:24:17.511 --> 03:24:19.492]  The globalists are afraid.
[03:24:19.492 --> 03:24:20.132]  They're scared.
[03:24:20.132 --> 03:24:21.092]  We've got them on the run.
[03:24:21.092 --> 03:24:24.153]  And a critical component of all of this is knowledge.
[03:24:24.633 --> 03:24:34.318]  We've gotten a lot of emails over this past weekend from people who said, you know, really appreciate everything that you're saying, really appreciate everything Alex is saying, but what are we going to do about it?
[03:24:34.318 --> 03:24:36.760]  Well, exactly what we're doing about it.
[03:24:36.760 --> 03:24:42.263]  This is, as Alex says, an information war, and we need to get in front of the information.
[03:24:42.263 --> 03:24:46.845]  We need to keep educating the people, our neighbors, our friends, our colleagues.
[03:24:46.845 --> 03:24:47.966]  The people will listen.
[03:24:50.162 --> 03:24:52.183]  And we will win on the numbers.
[03:24:52.183 --> 03:24:53.665]  Don't ever give up.
[03:24:53.665 --> 03:24:57.527]  We have to unite and we have to present a united front.
[03:24:57.527 --> 03:25:01.130]  And the fact is, this war is really going hot.
[03:25:01.130 --> 03:25:08.836]  What I have discovered and what the information which buys us surveillance, it is so big.
[03:25:08.836 --> 03:25:09.836]  You think it's bad?
[03:25:09.836 --> 03:25:13.679]  You haven't heard how bad it actually is or was.
[03:25:13.679 --> 03:25:17.622]  There was a piece by Sheryl Atkinson this weekend.
[03:25:18.526 --> 03:25:28.211]  The difference between a Section 702, the traditional FISA surveillance, versus a Title I surveillance, and what happened to Carter Page.
[03:25:28.211 --> 03:25:31.013]  When you hear this, when you hear the results from this
[03:25:32.477 --> 03:25:43.762]  When you understand exactly what they have done with respect to Carter Page, what Lynch and Comey, but it all lies at the desk of Obama.
[03:25:43.762 --> 03:25:56.367]  When you hear what they have done and how they entrapped Carter Page and others within the Donald Trump concentric circles of influence,
[03:25:58.077 --> 03:26:04.640]  You will be astounded, you will be amazed, and you will be angered, because this information, I'm bringing you a lot of information.
[03:26:04.640 --> 03:26:21.748]  So getting right into it, Sheryl Atkinson, and this was reported by the Conservative Treehouse as well, Sheryl Atkinson had made a very important distinction about what the memo, the executive summary memo, really got into.
[03:26:22.818 --> 03:26:35.108]  And inside the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, that memo, a key distinction that has been conflated, or people really are not understanding, the difference between a Title I versus a Title VII surveillance.
[03:26:35.108 --> 03:26:36.929]  Now, you might think, man, this is boring.
[03:26:36.929 --> 03:26:37.550]  Leave me alone.
[03:26:37.550 --> 03:26:38.771]  I don't want to hear this.
[03:26:38.771 --> 03:26:41.553]  No, you got to hear this, because, and it's not that difficult.
[03:26:41.553 --> 03:26:43.615]  It's really, it's simple.
[03:26:43.615 --> 03:26:50.080]  And look, I've been involved as an operational asset with the Department of Justice and the FBI back in the 90s.
[03:26:50.080 --> 03:26:51.321]  Forgive me for that, okay?
[03:26:52.771 --> 03:26:56.173]  But nonetheless, I understand what it takes to get a warrant.
[03:26:56.173 --> 03:27:00.055]  I understand what it takes to get a search warrant, to get a wiretapping warrant.
[03:27:00.055 --> 03:27:02.937]  I understand how it, what it takes to go before a U.S.
[03:27:02.937 --> 03:27:04.478]  attorney.
[03:27:04.478 --> 03:27:12.121]  I understand what it, as an operational asset, what it takes to verify my bona fides on a warrant application.
[03:27:12.121 --> 03:27:17.204]  I'm not talking about a FISA warrant, I'm talking about a regular Title VII or a regular court, U.S.
[03:27:17.204 --> 03:27:18.125]  Magistrate Court warrant.
[03:27:18.125 --> 03:27:18.745]  So I get it.
[03:27:19.835 --> 03:27:24.560]  But what happened here, the process was not just short-circuited.
[03:27:24.560 --> 03:27:35.370]  What happened here was that the Department of Justice, the FBI, was so infiltrated by deep state operatives working exactly for Hillary Clinton.
[03:27:35.370 --> 03:27:39.434]  That they turned off all the fail-safe controls and engaged in fraud.
[03:27:39.434 --> 03:27:40.274]  There it is.
[03:27:40.274 --> 03:27:40.935]  There it is.
[03:27:40.935 --> 03:27:44.999]  And it wasn't an, oops, this was a, we're going to do it this way.
[03:27:45.874 --> 03:27:48.196]  And this is exactly what happened.
[03:27:48.196 --> 03:27:53.320]  But the diabolical nature of this, Alex, I gotta tell you.
[03:27:53.320 --> 03:28:04.449]  They took Carter Page in 2016 and just did not make him or describe him as a potential Russian asset.
[03:28:04.449 --> 03:28:10.995]  Title I designates him as a Russian spy, period, full stop.
[03:28:11.876 --> 03:28:21.219]  And what happens there, and as Sheryl Atkinson and Conspiracy House reported, he is like patient zero in an Ebola pandemic.
[03:28:21.219 --> 03:28:27.602]  Because everyone he contacts, everyone he's got contact with, everyone who calls him, emails him.
[03:28:27.602 --> 03:28:30.883]  They convicted him like he was Osama Bin Laden.
[03:28:30.883 --> 03:28:32.223]  Exactly, exactly.
[03:28:32.223 --> 03:28:39.186]  But not only just Carter Page, if I typed an email to you mentioning Carter Page, whether it's in the body or the subject line,
[03:28:39.915 --> 03:28:46.602]  They, because it's a Title 1 surveillance as opposed to Section 702, because we could... It's a total dragnet.
[03:28:46.602 --> 03:28:47.383]  We're going to break.
[03:28:47.383 --> 03:28:48.164]  You're on fire.
[03:28:48.164 --> 03:28:49.865]  Doug Hagman, straight ahead.

[03:29:56.098 --> 03:29:57.759]  Matt in Ohio, you're on the air.
[03:29:57.759 --> 03:29:58.699]  Another Matt, go ahead.
[03:29:58.699 --> 03:30:13.247]  Yeah, hey, listen, I just wanted to say real quick, I'm a longtime listener of InfoWars, and I just wanted to say that the t-shirts that you guys are offering are absolutely fantastic, and that really is a great way to deal with this battle in the InfoWars.
[03:30:13.247 --> 03:30:20.911]  It might seem like a simple thing, but particularly these slogan t-shirts that you guys got up right now are absolutely amazing.
[03:30:20.911 --> 03:30:21.371]  Well, thank you,
[03:30:21.411 --> 03:30:32.554]  My favorite new one is the Don't Tread On Me, but instead it says Won't Tread On Me, and it's a big Dayglo snake, Gadsden snake, and then it's got the American flag, Infowars.com on the right arm.
[03:30:32.554 --> 03:30:38.796]  I mean, that's a great way just to meet like-minded people and spread the word, and also exercise free speech.
[03:30:38.796 --> 03:30:41.077]  And the newest one is Trigger Warning T-shirt.
[03:30:41.957 --> 03:30:48.824]  Trigger warning t-shirt, which is the symbol of a trigger, with a yield sign and then InfoWars.com on the back.
[03:30:48.824 --> 03:30:54.650]  That is the new shirt of the month, available exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:30:54.650 --> 03:31:02.197]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that
[03:31:03.780 --> 03:31:14.610]  When you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[03:31:14.610 --> 03:31:16.731]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[03:31:16.731 --> 03:31:20.735]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:31:20.735 --> 03:31:21.756]  I want to thank everybody that has.

[03:31:54.540 --> 03:31:56.523]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[03:31:56.523 --> 03:31:57.224]  Go ahead.
[03:31:57.224 --> 03:31:59.408]  Yeah, Alex, I just have to say something, man.
[03:31:59.408 --> 03:32:02.473]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[03:32:03.300 --> 03:32:04.720]  It just gets old, man.
[03:32:04.720 --> 03:32:07.141]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[03:32:07.141 --> 03:32:09.462]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[03:32:09.462 --> 03:32:13.483]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[03:32:13.483 --> 03:32:16.783]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[03:32:16.783 --> 03:32:19.464]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[03:32:19.464 --> 03:32:20.824]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[03:32:20.824 --> 03:32:21.945]  Us being shut down?
[03:32:21.945 --> 03:32:22.965]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[03:32:23.405 --> 03:32:25.587]  You know what, Alex?
[03:32:25.587 --> 03:32:26.688]  Hey, Frank!
[03:32:26.688 --> 03:32:32.352]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[03:32:32.352 --> 03:32:36.876]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[03:32:36.876 --> 03:32:40.019]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[03:32:40.019 --> 03:32:40.479]  You understand?
[03:32:40.479 --> 03:32:42.121]  I need your help, Frank!
[03:32:42.121 --> 03:32:43.241]  I need your help, Frank!
[03:32:44.222 --> 03:32:49.588]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the InfoWars!
[03:32:49.588 --> 03:32:50.569]  Do you understand?
[03:32:50.569 --> 03:32:52.191]  I need your help, Frank!
[03:32:52.191 --> 03:32:57.957]  Free Press needs your help, Frank!
[03:32:57.957 --> 03:33:00.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:15.825 --> 03:33:18.907]  Waging War on Corruption.
[03:33:18.907 --> 03:33:19.928]  Alex Jones.
[03:33:24.566 --> 03:33:25.427]  And welcome back.
[03:33:25.427 --> 03:33:27.168]  Doug Hagman sitting in for Alex.
[03:33:27.168 --> 03:33:28.109]  Thanks so much, Alex.
[03:33:28.109 --> 03:33:31.391]  I got a lot of stuff, a lot of information to get into.
[03:33:31.391 --> 03:33:33.973]  We also have a video clip coming up.
[03:33:33.973 --> 03:33:40.317]  Brian Stelzer saying the memo is an alternate reality created by Sean Hannity.
[03:33:40.317 --> 03:33:44.020]  Yeah, that's the ticket, right, as John Lovitz used to say.
[03:33:44.020 --> 03:33:46.381]  Well, speaking about the memo, look,
[03:33:49.023 --> 03:34:06.919]  The information that was done that was uncovered by Cheryl Atkinson this weekend and the information that was uncovered and really provided through a number of outlets but not enough to really make a difference is so incredibly important and I want to get into that.
[03:34:06.919 --> 03:34:10.062]  There is a there is a terrific distinction
[03:34:10.874 --> 03:34:15.839]  between what happened with Carter Page and with what is being said.
[03:34:15.839 --> 03:34:20.984]  Speaking of alternate realities, this is not created by Sean Hannity.
[03:34:20.984 --> 03:34:30.574]  The alternate reality is one that was created not by Sean Hannity, but by the progressives who wanted to overthrow and continue to want to overthrow our country.
[03:34:30.574 --> 03:34:34.558]  As a matter of fact, can we play that 54-second audio clip, Brian Stelzer?
[03:34:36.539 --> 03:34:43.865]  This entire memo thing, I know it's confusing, but it gives the Hannity's of the world an alternative reality to live in.
[03:34:43.865 --> 03:34:47.248]  It gives Trump a way to say he's vindicated even though he's not.
[03:34:47.248 --> 03:34:51.813]  It lets Trump allies say Mueller's probe is tainted and needs to be shut down.
[03:34:51.813 --> 03:34:54.936]  It allows them to turn every claim around on its head.
[03:34:55.476 --> 03:34:55.996]  Collusion?
[03:34:55.996 --> 03:34:57.597]  Yeah, there was collusion by the Democrats.
[03:34:57.597 --> 03:34:58.357]  Obstruction?
[03:34:58.357 --> 03:35:00.117]  Yeah, the Dems obstructed.
[03:35:00.117 --> 03:35:03.358]  It's like that old childhood schoolyard taunt.
[03:35:03.358 --> 03:35:05.078]  I'm rubber, you're glue.
[03:35:05.078 --> 03:35:09.399]  Whatever you say bounces off of me and sticks to you.
[03:35:09.399 --> 03:35:17.261]  Now, the current en vogue talking point is there is an important investigation going on, but it's not the investigation into Russian interference in the election.
[03:35:17.261 --> 03:35:18.662]  It's the investigation into the FBI.
[03:35:19.622 --> 03:35:22.084]  That's the alternative reality.
[03:35:22.084 --> 03:35:24.827]  And look, this campaign of confusion is good for Hannity.
[03:35:24.827 --> 03:35:26.188]  His ratings are way up.
[03:35:26.188 --> 03:35:27.990]  It's good for Trump as well.
[03:35:27.990 --> 03:35:29.111]  But it's bad for the country.
[03:35:30.405 --> 03:35:33.708]  Okay, now everyone just heard what he said, right?
[03:35:33.708 --> 03:35:34.628]  It's undeniable.
[03:35:34.628 --> 03:35:36.109]  You talk about an alternative reality.
[03:35:36.109 --> 03:35:37.791]  I'll tell you what the alternative reality is.
[03:35:37.791 --> 03:35:40.292]  It's not, again, it's not from Sean Hannity.
[03:35:40.292 --> 03:35:41.313]  It's not from the right.
[03:35:41.313 --> 03:35:42.874]  It's not from Devin Nunes.
[03:35:42.874 --> 03:35:45.837]  It's not from the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.
[03:35:45.837 --> 03:35:49.740]  The alternate reality is from the progressives attempting to rewrite history.
[03:35:49.740 --> 03:35:53.182]  And there was something said, which I thought was so amazing.
[03:35:53.182 --> 03:35:56.845]  There was a reference to Joe McCarthy, referencing Senator Joe McCarthy.
[03:35:57.626 --> 03:36:00.789]  I think it was in a tweet by James Comey.
[03:36:04.388 --> 03:36:05.689]  Not too many schools.
[03:36:05.689 --> 03:36:06.470]  Remember this tweet?
[03:36:06.470 --> 03:36:07.751]  It was over this past weekend.
[03:36:07.751 --> 03:36:17.920]  Not too many schools, not too many streets renamed after Joe, or named after Joe McCarthy, meaning Senator Joe McCarthy from the, from the McCarthy era back in post-World War II.
[03:36:17.920 --> 03:36:25.907]  Now we just, you just heard Andre from Russia, very interesting, talking about the new Russia or what Russia is today.
[03:36:25.907 --> 03:36:31.872]  And keep that in the back of your mind as you consider the Comey reference to Joe McCarthy.
[03:36:31.872 --> 03:36:32.212]  Now look,
[03:36:33.155 --> 03:36:45.772]  We have had problems in this country with the KGB, with the spy apparatus, the Russian spy apparatus, the old Soviet Russian spy apparatus in America.
[03:36:45.772 --> 03:36:48.096]  Senator John McCarthy proved this.
[03:36:49.413 --> 03:36:54.176]  The House Un-American Activities Committee proved this.
[03:36:54.176 --> 03:36:59.519]  Two separate things often conflated, much like what is happening today is conflated.
[03:36:59.519 --> 03:37:01.420]  But think back in history.
[03:37:01.420 --> 03:37:06.383]  McCarthy, of course, McCarthyism, to be accused of McCarthyism.
[03:37:06.383 --> 03:37:11.346]  People right now are using that term in different areas.
[03:37:11.346 --> 03:37:14.328]  But really, Joe McCarthy, Senator Joe McCarthy, was correct.
[03:37:15.041 --> 03:37:19.084]  And there's a wonderful book by Diana West that she wrote, American Betrayal, that lays this all out.
[03:37:19.084 --> 03:37:20.545]  And of course, the Venona Secrets.
[03:37:20.545 --> 03:37:24.709]  Look, you've got to know history in order to understand the present.
[03:37:24.709 --> 03:37:26.310]  This is what we're seeing today.
[03:37:26.310 --> 03:37:30.173]  We have seen or what we saw in the past eight years of the Obama regime.
[03:37:30.173 --> 03:37:33.736]  I don't even want to call it an administration.
[03:37:33.736 --> 03:37:42.843]  The infiltration by hostile foreign countries into our State Department, into our government apparatus, multiple agencies.
[03:37:43.504 --> 03:37:45.646]  That's not alternate reality.
[03:37:45.646 --> 03:37:47.508]  That's reality, period.
[03:37:47.508 --> 03:37:49.369]  And that needs to be investigated.
[03:37:49.369 --> 03:37:51.251]  That has taken form, taken shape.
[03:37:51.986 --> 03:38:01.429]  Of the things like the dossier, the 35-page piece of garbage out there that is reported as news or as valid.
[03:38:01.429 --> 03:38:03.450]  Absolutely, Doug.
[03:38:03.450 --> 03:38:05.830]  Doug Hagman here hosting the fourth hour, just breaking in.
[03:38:05.830 --> 03:38:11.532]  We were following this earlier, just an hour ago, and the stock market was only down 600 points, which is still big.
[03:38:11.532 --> 03:38:12.312]  It dropped 1600 points.
[03:38:14.293 --> 03:38:24.122]  Uh, today, which is one of the biggest drops ever, and then rebounded, rebounded 800 points, but it's still 800 points down.
[03:38:24.122 --> 03:38:34.611]  And Doug, you talk about deep state operations, you talk about Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, they've been working against the President, even though they've had record profits, they openly cheerlead for Communist China.
[03:38:34.611 --> 03:38:36.853]  This is the type of craziness we've been saying will come.
[03:38:37.933 --> 03:38:43.558]  As he and as we stand up against the deep state actors and all the rest of it.
[03:38:43.558 --> 03:38:46.581]  So this is an amazing time to be alive.
[03:38:46.581 --> 03:38:53.587]  Right now we're going to follow this right through with you the next 30 minutes right into the war room with Owen Schroer, myself and others during all this.
[03:38:53.587 --> 03:38:56.149]  But again, Infowars.com, Newswars.com, the latest coverage.
[03:38:56.149 --> 03:38:56.810]  1,600 is like 1,580 something point.
[03:38:56.810 --> 03:38:57.230]  1,600 of you wrap it up.
[03:39:03.840 --> 03:39:13.144]  from from way up there at 26,000 down to, you know, close to 24,000.
[03:39:13.144 --> 03:39:15.585]  This is a big, big deal.
[03:39:15.585 --> 03:39:19.327]  And again, this is economic warfare undoubtedly against this president.
[03:39:19.327 --> 03:39:20.767]  They've been trying as hard as they can.
[03:39:20.767 --> 03:39:23.749]  There is touring the country getting thousands of factories back.
[03:39:23.749 --> 03:39:25.389]  And now this happens.
[03:39:25.389 --> 03:39:26.730]  You better believe something this big.
[03:39:27.270 --> 03:39:30.574]  It's meant to embarrass him on his big economic tour he's involved in.
[03:39:30.574 --> 03:39:35.480]  It was Lloyd Blankfein, the head of Goldman Sachs, that heads up the New World Order that set a few months ago.
[03:39:35.480 --> 03:39:36.401]  Oh, I was in China.
[03:39:36.401 --> 03:39:38.043]  Their industry is much bigger.
[03:39:38.043 --> 03:39:41.848]  How's your industry, how's your infrastructure week going?
[03:39:41.848 --> 03:39:44.992]  This is the economic war in our country right now.
[03:39:44.992 --> 03:39:46.754]  So, going back to Doug Eggman.
[03:39:48.919 --> 03:39:49.939]  Fantastic points.
[03:39:49.939 --> 03:39:58.804]  And you know, the economy, the money, we are just going to kill the dollar from five, six years ago, seven years ago.
[03:39:58.804 --> 03:40:00.845]  This is blowback by the deep state.
[03:40:00.845 --> 03:40:02.386]  You're absolutely right.
[03:40:02.386 --> 03:40:04.867]  An incredible time to be alive to witness this.
[03:40:04.867 --> 03:40:12.892]  And of course, the controls by the deep state include the dollar, the purchasing power of our dollar, the food, everything that
[03:40:14.192 --> 03:40:23.458]  This is absolute blowback, and I think it's designed, obviously, to really take everyone's attention away from really what's important.
[03:40:23.458 --> 03:40:29.302]  Of course, this is important, but it's more of a symptom than the actual problem.
[03:40:29.302 --> 03:40:39.069]  Man, imagine 20 years ago, 30 years ago, I remember sitting actually outside of a bank 30 years ago watching bankers come out of this bank
[03:40:39.930 --> 03:40:44.556]  It was October of 87, I believe it was, and the Dow had dropped, I think, what, 300 points?
[03:40:44.556 --> 03:40:47.660]  It was just, imagine today.
[03:40:47.660 --> 03:40:50.183]  That was nothing compared to today.
[03:40:50.183 --> 03:40:53.147]  So, we have to keep our eye on what's taking place.
[03:40:53.147 --> 03:40:54.409]  Watch the blowback.
[03:40:54.409 --> 03:40:56.091]  The blowback is incredibly important.
[03:40:56.751 --> 03:41:01.194]  So, and Alex, thank you very much for keeping me informed on this.
[03:41:01.194 --> 03:41:08.559]  By the way, I got a comment the other day, it was Saturday, saying, you know what, you sounded pretty good on InfoWars.
[03:41:08.559 --> 03:41:19.327]  And I told him, I said, man, you got to try, I just have to mention this, the Real Red Pill, I got to tell you, I don't know what's in that, but go to InfoWars store, InfoWars store.
[03:41:19.327 --> 03:41:22.769]  You got to get this product, the Real Red Pill and so forth.
[03:41:22.769 --> 03:41:24.870]  Look, this stuff really works.
[03:41:24.870 --> 03:41:25.691]  I can see through walls.
[03:41:27.841 --> 03:41:32.443]  The idea of the Real Red Pill, as well as Cell Force, which is on sale right now.
[03:41:32.443 --> 03:41:35.644]  Limited time sale on Cell Force by InfoWars.
[03:41:35.644 --> 03:41:37.905]  53% off discount.
[03:41:37.905 --> 03:41:37.925]  $69.95.
[03:41:37.925 --> 03:41:39.585]  You can't beat that.
[03:41:39.585 --> 03:41:40.186]  I take it.
[03:41:40.186 --> 03:41:41.086]  I feel great.
[03:41:41.086 --> 03:41:43.147]  Never felt better before in my life.
[03:41:43.147 --> 03:41:47.008]  So make sure you visit InfoWars store.
[03:41:47.008 --> 03:41:53.971]  Purchasing that not only helps you, it helps people like InfoWars, entities like InfoWars, and us stay on the air.
[03:41:53.971 --> 03:41:56.252]  So getting back to this issue.
[03:41:57.327 --> 03:42:01.729]  You know, I happen to think, too.
[03:42:01.729 --> 03:42:05.492]  33,942 surveillance warrants were granted in a 33-year period.
[03:42:05.492 --> 03:42:09.494]  I'm talking about numbers with respect to the stock market and such.
[03:42:09.494 --> 03:42:10.114]  Think about this.
[03:42:10.114 --> 03:42:16.137]  The FISA court was established back in 1979, I believe it was.
[03:42:16.137 --> 03:42:17.338]  I'm going from memory here.
[03:42:17.338 --> 03:42:19.199]  The only note I've got is this number, 33,942.
[03:42:19.199 --> 03:42:24.342]  That's the number of surveillance warrants that were actually issued.
[03:42:25.382 --> 03:42:28.485]  You know how many were denied in that 33-year period?
[03:42:28.485 --> 03:42:29.526]  Twelve.
[03:42:29.526 --> 03:42:34.410]  Which represents a 0.03% denial rate.
[03:42:34.410 --> 03:42:35.371]  Incredible.
[03:42:35.371 --> 03:42:37.233]  One denied, of course.
[03:42:37.233 --> 03:42:39.575]  Henceforth, later on.
[03:42:39.575 --> 03:42:42.538]  This is unbelievable.
[03:42:42.538 --> 03:42:43.338]  I just heard music.
[03:42:43.338 --> 03:42:46.121]  Am I on my way out there?
[03:42:46.121 --> 03:42:46.641]  Okay.
[03:42:46.641 --> 03:42:47.202]  Alright, folks.
[03:42:47.202 --> 03:42:48.543]  You're listening to InfoWars.
[03:42:48.543 --> 03:42:49.904]  Doug Hagman's today.
[03:42:49.904 --> 03:42:50.565]  Sorry about that.
[03:42:51.678 --> 03:42:53.058]  Got insanity in my ears!
[03:42:53.058 --> 03:42:53.759]  Remember that?
[03:42:53.759 --> 03:42:54.199]  Doug Hagman.
[03:42:54.199 --> 03:42:59.060]  I want to tell you about an exciting new product we have available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:42:59.060 --> 03:43:04.782]  And this is basically a product that I've been taking anyway before we even launched our own version of it.
[03:43:04.782 --> 03:43:07.743]  Now the product is bodies, whole body support.
[03:43:07.743 --> 03:43:13.045]  This is available right now at a massive 50% discount at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:43:13.045 --> 03:43:16.726]  It's the ultimate turmeric and inflammatory support product on the market.
[03:43:17.680 --> 03:43:25.983]  It's got the black pepper, which makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[03:43:25.983 --> 03:43:33.746]  Now, we're not even including a lot of the benefits that this product has been scientifically proven to have.
[03:43:33.746 --> 03:43:35.787]  So, I just got this fresh today.
[03:43:35.787 --> 03:43:38.068]  Literally, the seal's not even being opened on it.
[03:43:38.068 --> 03:43:38.808]  It's just $29.95.
[03:43:38.808 --> 03:43:41.850]  Again, big, big, chunky bottle.
[03:43:41.850 --> 03:43:44.731]  120 capsules in this bottle.
[03:43:44.731 --> 03:43:45.371]  It is bodies.
[03:43:46.414 --> 03:43:52.496]  The ultimate turmeric and inflammatory support product on the market available right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:43:52.496 --> 03:43:53.836]  Get it today.
[03:43:53.836 --> 03:43:57.658]  You know, I've got some talking points here about Caveman from InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:43:57.658 --> 03:44:02.399]  But instead of going on those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[03:44:02.399 --> 03:44:06.961]  From all the wives tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[03:44:06.961 --> 03:44:10.102]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[03:44:10.102 --> 03:44:13.223]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[03:44:14.727 --> 03:44:27.553]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[03:44:27.553 --> 03:44:42.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.
[03:44:43.600 --> 03:44:47.924]  Find out for yourself today at InfoWarsStore.com what it could do for your family.
[03:44:47.924 --> 03:44:49.625]  And again, I want to thank you all for your support.
[03:44:49.625 --> 03:44:52.528]  You are funding the Information War in 2018.
[03:44:52.528 --> 03:44:58.212]  InfoWars Live is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[03:44:58.212 --> 03:45:09.722]  We have found an extraordinary new natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory health, and normal breathing.
[03:45:09.722 --> 03:45:10.642]  This is pollen blood.
[03:45:11.623 --> 03:45:24.287]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs from specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like runny nose, itchy watery eyes, and excessive mucus production.
[03:45:24.287 --> 03:45:28.609]  They began studying the effects in published trials.
[03:45:28.609 --> 03:45:32.610]  Now we are introducing the fruit of the research, a fast-acting chewable tablet,
[03:45:33.090 --> 03:45:43.161]  Just chew two tablets at the first sign of seasonal distress and Fast-Acting Pollen Block starts working in about 15 minutes to help alleviate seasonal distress.
[03:45:43.161 --> 03:45:46.305]  Enjoy the air you breathe naturally with Fast-Acting Pollen Block.
[03:45:46.305 --> 03:45:50.510]  Available now at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free.
[03:45:50.510 --> 03:45:50.550]  888-253-3139
[03:45:54.874 --> 03:46:00.040]  Introducing Floralife, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by InfoWars Life.
[03:46:00.040 --> 03:46:04.806]  After years of research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same.
[03:46:04.806 --> 03:46:09.411]  Floralife probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach and
[03:46:09.571 --> 03:46:13.494]  And releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
[03:46:13.494 --> 03:46:16.996]  This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics.
[03:46:16.996 --> 03:46:22.240]  So if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet.
[03:46:22.240 --> 03:46:29.145]  Floralife supports your body's core where you need it most, including digestion, regularity, immunity, the gut lining and metabolism.
[03:46:29.545 --> 03:46:33.449]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?
[03:46:33.449 --> 03:46:38.174]  That's why increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[03:46:38.174 --> 03:46:46.282]  Floralife is sold as a 15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care and a 50 billion probiotic for a 30-day advanced gut restoration program.
[03:46:46.282 --> 03:46:50.466]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com to pick up your bottle of Floralife probiotics today.
[03:46:50.466 --> 03:46:51.768]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:46:57.964 --> 03:47:11.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:11.800 --> 03:47:16.526]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:20.949 --> 03:47:25.310]  And welcome back to InfoWars.com.
[03:47:25.310 --> 03:47:28.571]  Sitting in for Alex Jones, it's me, Doug Hagman.
[03:47:28.571 --> 03:47:32.232]  I've got to tell you, great music by the way.
[03:47:32.232 --> 03:47:36.833]  But the information presented just today alone, incredible.
[03:47:36.833 --> 03:47:40.254]  I'm going to have to listen to the interview with Andre from Russia again.
[03:47:41.394 --> 03:47:50.740]  But getting back into the core issue, the takeaway from my appearance today, if I can just leave you with one real important distinction.
[03:47:50.740 --> 03:47:58.785]  And we are ahead, I believe, Infowars.com, Hagman Report, Alex Jones, myself, we are ahead of the curve on this.
[03:47:58.785 --> 03:48:02.727]  Watch for discussions now of a couple of things.
[03:48:02.727 --> 03:48:07.470]  Additional memos coming out, the investigation moving from the Department of Justice and the FBI.
[03:48:09.051 --> 03:48:14.154]  There will be additional information coming out along with the foundational documents of that.
[03:48:14.154 --> 03:48:17.756]  But watch for the investigation.
[03:48:17.756 --> 03:48:23.679]  And by the way, the OIG, Mike Horowitz, but watch for the investigation of the Department of State.
[03:48:24.566 --> 03:48:32.849]  This coming out is going to be absolutely earth-shaking, as much as perhaps the Department of Justice and the FBI.
[03:48:32.849 --> 03:48:42.112]  But the other takeaway is the, I believe, the unintentional conflation, or perhaps the fact that many people are not recognizing
[03:48:42.713 --> 03:48:58.955]  The extent of the surveillance as depicted by the Nunes memo, you know, you heard all weekend as I did man I'll tell you what my ears were bleeding Really from listening to so many audio clips and watching so many so many pundits talk about what really happened
[03:48:59.745 --> 03:49:04.887]  But when you really get to it, I've not heard anyone mention this outside of Sheryl Atkinson.
[03:49:04.887 --> 03:49:12.871]  When you really get down to it, there's a key distinction about this that's being overlooked by many who are talking out there.
[03:49:12.871 --> 03:49:17.593]  And that is in the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.
[03:49:17.593 --> 03:49:19.774]  It specifically notes that the targeting of U.S.
[03:49:19.774 --> 03:49:26.637]  individual Carter Page was not, was not, I'm underlying this, was not a FISA Title VII search request.
[03:49:28.054 --> 03:49:36.460]  The Title 7 FISA 702 that we hear so much about references the incidental collection of U.S.
[03:49:36.460 --> 03:49:41.164]  persons information as it relates to national security.
[03:49:41.164 --> 03:49:42.945]  Now, this was a Title 1.
[03:49:42.945 --> 03:49:49.930]  This warrant request was a Title 1 and it was made on October 21, 2016.
[03:49:49.930 --> 03:49:55.634]  Again, under Title 1 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, meaning that the surveillance application
[03:49:56.574 --> 03:50:07.638]  Uh, was specifically stating to the court, to the FISA court, the US individual was likely an actual agent of a foreign government, a spy.
[03:50:07.638 --> 03:50:09.819]  This is what Carter, Carter Page is dealing with.
[03:50:09.819 --> 03:50:19.503]  This is what the October, uh, 2016, uh, FISA warrant was, was, this is all, this is the October 2016 FISA warrant.
[03:50:19.503 --> 03:50:21.444]  Now consider what they're saying here.
[03:50:22.222 --> 03:50:25.785]  And not only that, consider the ramifications from this.
[03:50:25.785 --> 03:50:32.411]  Because we're not talking just surveillance over Carter Page and any incidental collection, along with the unmasking.
[03:50:32.411 --> 03:50:34.133]  That would be bad enough.
[03:50:34.133 --> 03:50:39.357]  We are talking about something totally different here, at a new level of horrendous.
[03:50:39.357 --> 03:50:42.840]  That is a Title I FISA warrant.
[03:50:42.840 --> 03:50:44.342]  And I'll tell you how horrendous this is.
[03:50:45.288 --> 03:50:58.495]  If you're out there and you type an email, for example, that mentions Carter Page, yes, you, a private citizen, you could be caught up in this dragnet.
[03:50:58.495 --> 03:51:07.200]  Think about Carter Page as he was doing business in Moscow with Merrill Lynch and then a minor advisor on the Donald Trump team.
[03:51:07.200 --> 03:51:10.282]  Think about everyone he had contact with.
[03:51:10.282 --> 03:51:12.883]  What this Title I warrant did
[03:51:13.909 --> 03:51:23.996]  Was put a giant bullseye on every person that ever shook hands, essentially, with Carter Page.
[03:51:23.996 --> 03:51:27.518]  This is the difference between a 702 warrant and a Title I warrant.
[03:51:27.518 --> 03:51:34.783]  If you go away from this segment without anything else, understand how important the distinction is.
[03:51:35.712 --> 03:51:43.864]  This is, this requires the National Security Division, by the way, and the FBI, the Counterintelligence Division.
[03:51:43.864 --> 03:51:50.554]  This requires an entirely new level of proof, well beyond anything that the FISA court or the 702 requires.
[03:51:52.503 --> 03:51:58.408]  They were not just asking to review the ancillary data collected on a U.S.
[03:51:58.408 --> 03:52:01.531]  person as an outcome of surveillance on a form.
[03:52:01.531 --> 03:52:02.552]  No, that would be Title VII.
[03:52:02.552 --> 03:52:05.014]  That would be, and you've got to understand the difference.
[03:52:05.014 --> 03:52:06.435]  It sounds confusing, but it's really not.
[03:52:06.435 --> 03:52:08.977]  Title VII, FISA 702, that's one thing.
[03:52:08.977 --> 03:52:11.199]  Title I is something totally different.
[03:52:11.199 --> 03:52:20.787]  And in this action outlined within the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, in that memo, the Department of Justice and the FBI were specifically, they were telling the FISA court
[03:52:21.508 --> 03:52:24.175]  That they had evidence that the U.S.
[03:52:24.175 --> 03:52:30.330]  citizen, Carter Page, was working as an agent of a foreign government.
[03:52:30.894 --> 03:52:49.188]  Think Robert Hansen, even beyond that, perhaps, at that level, that accusation level, which is why we're seeing the pushback by Carter Page, because it's one thing to be caught up in a surveillance or to be named in a surveillance.
[03:52:49.188 --> 03:52:52.650]  It's another to be identified as a Russian hostile agent.
[03:52:52.650 --> 03:52:53.751]  And that's what happened here.
[03:52:54.651 --> 03:53:06.060]  Now, he was our target and therefore a direct target of the FISA Title 1 surveillance on October 21st, 2016.
[03:53:06.060 --> 03:53:21.732]  And to give validity to the underlying position of the Department of Justice and the FBI, the Justice Department used the Clinton Steele dossier media reports from and of the Clinton Steele dossier.
[03:53:21.732 --> 03:53:24.294]  And this is where, pay attention,
[03:53:25.026 --> 03:53:28.749]  This is where the Department of State is going to come in.
[03:53:28.749 --> 03:53:30.591]  Yes, I understand it's 2016.
[03:53:30.591 --> 03:53:35.315]  Yes, I understand that Hillary Clinton left the Department of State in 2013.
[03:53:35.315 --> 03:53:44.442]  But the carryovers, John Kerry, for example, the policies and procedures, as well as the input.
[03:53:44.442 --> 03:53:48.686]  Don't think that Hillary Clinton just left and had no other contact.
[03:53:48.686 --> 03:53:50.788]  No, this goes beyond 2013, her 2013 departure.
[03:53:50.788 --> 03:53:51.208]  But I digress.
[03:53:54.167 --> 03:53:58.331]  But this also involves Nelly and Bruce Ohr.
[03:53:58.331 --> 03:54:00.153]  This is how it all fits together.
[03:54:00.153 --> 03:54:02.255]  You gotta get a flowchart almost.
[03:54:02.255 --> 03:54:15.107]  So in total, this was a very sketchy, very ad hoc assembly of political campaign research disguised as intelligence and not even disguised very well.
[03:54:16.221 --> 03:54:19.822]  All with the authorship of Hillary Rodham Clinton.
[03:54:19.822 --> 03:54:21.003]  And the kicker is this.
[03:54:21.003 --> 03:54:24.884]  This leads all the way up to Barack Hussein Obama.
[03:54:24.884 --> 03:54:28.485]  I'm going to tell you right now, Obama knew.
[03:54:28.485 --> 03:54:34.948]  Obama was okay with it, at the very least, or had some level of direction.
[03:54:34.948 --> 03:54:38.349]  I think we're going to find the latter as opposed to the former.
[03:54:38.349 --> 03:54:38.489]  Now,
[03:54:39.344 --> 03:54:47.946]  Without knowing the court had been provided political research, the FISA court granted the FBI full surveillance authority under Title 1 of Carter Page.
[03:54:47.946 --> 03:54:50.967]  And what that did was that acted like a domino.
[03:54:50.967 --> 03:54:56.268]  And that was like a tripwire for the rest of the surveillance that was conducted.
[03:54:56.268 --> 03:54:59.869]  So Comey, look, Comey, we know Comey lied.
[03:55:00.920 --> 03:55:02.101]  In his testimony.
[03:55:02.101 --> 03:55:07.265]  We know Comey lied when he put his John Hancock on that FISA warrant.
[03:55:07.265 --> 03:55:12.989]  We know that Rod Rosenstein and Sally Yates intentionally deceived the FISA court.
[03:55:12.989 --> 03:55:22.937]  Okay, this is me saying this from my personal research and my personal investigation, but this goes much deeper and much wider and this is
[03:55:25.193 --> 03:55:29.176]  By orders of magnitude far greater than Watergate could ever be.
[03:55:29.176 --> 03:55:33.579]  Any comparison to Watergate should never, ever be.
[03:55:33.579 --> 03:55:45.386]  This is a dictatorship move by Barack Hussein Obama, conspiring with his Department of Justice, his FBI.
[03:55:45.386 --> 03:55:52.931]  And I know you might be getting tired of hearing about this, but let me tell you, the devil is really in the details in this.
[03:55:53.752 --> 03:56:09.501]  And when the details come out, and trust me when I tell you this, when the details come out of how bad this is, that memo was just, the Nunes memo, just giving a little bit of information in terms of the underlying documentation.
[03:56:09.501 --> 03:56:17.465]  When you see, and I've talked to an FBI agent who spoke, well, I guess I'll just say this, I've talked to an FBI agent who spoke with
[03:56:19.156 --> 03:56:27.541]  The staff of one of the committee members who saw the underlying documentation, and it is brutal.
[03:56:27.541 --> 03:56:28.521]  I'll just share that with you.
[03:56:28.521 --> 03:56:29.101]  It's brutal.
[03:56:29.101 --> 03:56:31.623]  And when it comes out, it's going to hit like a thud.
[03:56:32.600 --> 03:56:40.285]  You heard that audio clip about Sean Hannity, and this is Sean Hannity's alternate reality?
[03:56:40.285 --> 03:56:41.186]  No.
[03:56:41.186 --> 03:56:41.927]  No.
[03:56:41.927 --> 03:56:46.650]  This is actually information that Sean Hannity will be leading off with.
[03:56:46.650 --> 03:56:47.290]  You're ahead.
[03:56:47.290 --> 03:56:52.554]  You are ahead in the information war right now by listening to InfoWars.
[03:56:52.554 --> 03:56:57.397]  You're ahead in the information war as you listen, of course, to this segment.
[03:56:57.397 --> 03:57:01.080]  And I've got to tell you, what's coming next is going to be something critical.
[03:57:01.080 --> 03:57:02.141]  Watch the stock market.
[03:57:02.641 --> 03:57:07.004]  Watch the ups and downs of the stock market, the volatility there.
[03:57:07.004 --> 03:57:09.986]  Watch what happens, because there's blowback.
[03:57:09.986 --> 03:57:16.031]  You know, make sure your seat backs and tray tables are in their full upright and locked position, because it's going to get bumpy out there.
[03:57:16.031 --> 03:57:21.514]  I'm going to tell you, Doug Hagman, sitting in for Alex InfoWars.
