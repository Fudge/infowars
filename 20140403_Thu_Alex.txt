[00:00.000 --> 00:12.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.200 --> 00:22.360]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:22.360 --> 00:29.400]  Lieutenant General Mark Milley, commanding general of Fort Hood, told our reporters
[00:29.400 --> 00:34.400]  Zechari Jackson and Kit Daniels last night during the press conference that
[00:34.400 --> 00:38.680]  the reported Fort Hood shooter who killed three people and then himself injuring
[00:38.680 --> 00:45.480]  16 others was on psychotropic drugs ladies and gentlemen and I'm not
[00:45.480 --> 00:49.160]  tooting our horn I'm pointing out that the mainstream corporate horror media was
[00:49.160 --> 00:55.480]  not asking those questions our reporters drove the hour and a half to the base
[00:55.480 --> 01:01.720]  command from Austin Texas in Fort Hood the largest army base in the world and
[01:01.720 --> 01:07.600]  ask the real questions we're going to air that press conference or clips of it
[01:07.600 --> 01:11.680]  coming up but we're also going to have extended clips of it coming up later in
[01:11.680 --> 01:17.200]  the broadcast former congressman Ron Paul will also be joining us today to talk
[01:17.200 --> 01:21.200]  about a host of issues from the economy to what's happening with the new Cold
[01:21.200 --> 01:24.840]  War with Russia so he'll be on with the first 20 minutes of the second hour
[01:24.840 --> 01:32.000]  today but I've got to say that I came out of NOAA last night which is a pretty
[01:32.000 --> 01:37.520]  good science fiction movie and to a certain extent biblically based I'm not
[01:37.520 --> 01:41.720]  saying it's all accurate but if you actually read the Bible it's got fallen
[01:41.720 --> 01:45.480]  angels giving man technology and breeding with women and genetic
[01:45.480 --> 01:51.400]  engineering and kind of an Atlanta story and so if you believe the Bible it's
[01:51.400 --> 01:56.320]  it's it's a pretty heavy stuff the mainline preachers the last 200 years
[01:56.320 --> 02:02.040]  that can't deal with it will tell you all that that's you know a false
[02:02.040 --> 02:08.560]  interpretation of it you know the Nephilim coming down to earth the
[02:08.560 --> 02:13.400]  giants having having sex with the women that destroying the genetics in the
[02:13.400 --> 02:17.720]  movie NOAA though it's clearly eugenics depopulation propaganda film overall
[02:17.720 --> 02:20.880]  that's the positive aspects I'll give my review later in the third hour I want to
[02:20.880 --> 02:27.720]  write some notes and kind of think about it but if you read Genesis that is a
[02:27.720 --> 02:35.040]  story of God destroying the human life on earth because of evil and because of
[02:35.040 --> 02:43.280]  genetic pollution breeding with fallen angels now that's clearly what the
[02:43.280 --> 02:50.520]  Bible says and again your mainline preachers can't deal with it and so they
[02:50.520 --> 02:53.960]  want to keep everybody basically away from that information but that's
[02:53.960 --> 03:00.800]  basically where this film goes it's kind of like Prometheus meets the Bible and
[03:00.800 --> 03:05.000]  see what's happening is the elites are now looking at all the genetic codes and
[03:05.000 --> 03:08.480]  the scientists are and a lot of them that were atheists are freaking out and
[03:08.480 --> 03:12.440]  going public saying okay we were clearly designed there is a creator and so they
[03:12.440 --> 03:16.640]  want to rebel against Christianity that's been proven accurate the real
[03:16.640 --> 03:20.840]  Christianity and of course Judaism that it came out of and those accurate
[03:20.840 --> 03:26.360]  records that were kept by the scribes that passed on the information they
[03:26.360 --> 03:31.040]  don't want to to admit that's right so they basically say okay space aliens
[03:31.040 --> 03:39.480]  created us but regardless the point is it's the question of our age and it is a
[03:39.480 --> 03:47.000]  story of depopulation but because the genetics had been destroyed and you now
[03:47.000 --> 03:50.400]  see the attack by the globalist today trying to change human genetics if
[03:50.400 --> 03:55.520]  revocably with the GMO that actually changed our genetics on record and then
[03:55.520 --> 04:00.400]  you realize oh my gosh this is the same story repeating but God won't destroy the
[04:00.400 --> 04:07.440]  earth this time with water but with fire and then you realize these aren't just
[04:07.440 --> 04:13.200]  allegories you realize this isn't just stuff people made up you realize this is
[04:13.200 --> 04:21.080]  repeating itself it's incredible it's incredible and every ancient culture has
[04:21.080 --> 04:27.560]  the same flood story from the same period so we're gonna be talking about
[04:27.560 --> 04:31.760]  that some in the third hour again I'm not endorsing the film I think the
[04:31.760 --> 04:36.200]  people that made it were trying to be good but I mean it was like Kane is like
[04:36.200 --> 04:42.480]  an Alex Jones character who's pro-human it's got some serious problems all right
[04:42.480 --> 04:47.320]  ladies and gentlemen we'll be right back on the other side but I think we all do
[04:47.320 --> 04:51.680]  have a twist of Kane in us don't we we'll be right back ladies and gentlemen on
[04:51.680 --> 04:55.280]  the other side we've got the incredible video and audio of our reporters at
[04:55.280 --> 04:59.480]  Fort Hood psychotropics yet again
[04:59.480 --> 05:04.200]  a chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties
[05:04.200 --> 05:07.680]  this year alone over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water
[05:07.680 --> 05:11.560]  contaminate what are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking
[05:11.560 --> 05:15.280]  water it's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents my

[05:25.920 --> 05:29.480]  a week few filters cut out the glyphosates that is found in water

[06:08.760 --> 06:12.840]  outside that's toxic indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher
[06:12.840 --> 06:17.120]  concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90
[06:17.120 --> 06:21.040]  percent of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes there are

[06:29.080 --> 06:32.800]  fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well when
[06:32.800 --> 06:36.520]  I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start

[08:19.040 --> 08:32.640]  at military bases like Fort Hood Texas and other installations around the
[08:32.640 --> 08:37.800]  country there was a nationwide manhunt for a former army soldier they
[08:37.800 --> 08:43.000]  believed it was preparing to carry out a jihad mass shooting attack at military
[08:43.000 --> 08:50.040]  bases they weren't sure where then someone reportedly on psychotropic drugs
[08:50.040 --> 08:55.320]  and under psychiatric care as well as ambient on its own insert saying it can
[08:55.320 --> 09:01.320]  cause psychotic breaks sleepwalking murder you name it we now learned that he
[09:01.320 --> 09:06.120]  killed himself and three others injuring 16 and we have the suspect's name and
[09:06.120 --> 09:11.120]  information lieutenant general mark milley the commander the three-star
[09:11.120 --> 09:16.640]  general over Fort Hood Texas military base was being asked the classic soft
[09:16.640 --> 09:22.120]  ball questions by the corporate prostitute lapdog sycophant media but
[09:22.120 --> 09:27.840]  as soon as the shooting began that was in the news jacari jackson and kit
[09:27.840 --> 09:34.840]  daniels two of our info wars dot com reporters got in a car and drove the
[09:34.840 --> 09:38.840]  hour and a half to Fort Hood and we're at the press conference and were the
[09:38.840 --> 09:44.720]  reporters that asked about was he on drugs and how long did it take for the
[09:44.720 --> 09:49.880]  police to respond and the word is 10 to 15 minutes so though they're going back
[09:49.880 --> 09:54.400]  and forth because it is a huge base I mean it's it's the biggest military base
[09:54.400 --> 10:00.840]  in the world it's about six times the size of Dallas Texas conservatively and
[10:00.840 --> 10:04.640]  so they had to respond and it took them a while to get there where he was
[10:04.640 --> 10:11.120]  shooting people up in a personal dispute reportedly and the generals says he
[10:11.120 --> 10:16.160]  doesn't think people should be able to have concealed carry on the base the
[10:16.160 --> 10:19.440]  quote law enforcement should have that so you got soldiers that are trained to
[10:19.440 --> 10:25.920]  kill people and break things but they can't have guns when they're on the
[10:25.920 --> 10:30.560]  base in their own private homes you got to lock them up in the armory even in
[10:30.560 --> 10:36.680]  the bases that allow that that's outrageous so people can be victims in a
[10:36.680 --> 10:40.400]  victim disarmament zone just like the naval yard and remember the naval yard
[10:40.400 --> 10:46.440]  they fought to keep its secret that he was on a bunch of psychiatric drugs and
[10:46.440 --> 10:50.640]  have been in psychiatric care and the police have been called not once not
[10:50.640 --> 10:56.080]  twice but three times to hotels where he said the government was mind-controlling
[10:56.080 --> 11:00.240]  him now I normally I'd say that's just a schizophrenic or somebody on these drugs
[11:00.240 --> 11:05.400]  that makes you crazy the problem was he was in classified areas with DARPA with
[11:05.400 --> 11:11.760]  ELF mind-control type systems and then showed up with his shotgun that said my
[11:11.760 --> 11:16.200]  ELF weapon on it reportedly shooting people and they had a drill there two
[11:16.200 --> 11:24.680]  days before so very very very very very suspicious jacari Jackson and hit
[11:24.680 --> 11:28.120]  Daniels are going to be in studio that they were up till about four in the
[11:28.120 --> 11:31.880]  morning getting their video report coming back to Austin in their video
[11:31.880 --> 11:35.800]  report file jacari's coming in kids already here I don't expect him to come
[11:35.800 --> 11:39.680]  in but if he gets in we're gonna have him in here at the bottom of the hour so
[11:39.680 --> 11:45.040]  great job our reporters on that let me go over what we know right now that I'm
[11:45.040 --> 11:47.920]  gonna air part of this press conference we'll have more of that on the nightly
[11:47.920 --> 11:52.960]  news tonight where our reporters asked all the real questions and when the
[11:52.960 --> 11:55.520]  general says no he doesn't think anybody should have console carry on base
[11:55.520 --> 12:02.360]  even off duty kit goes so it takes 15 minutes for the police to get there but
[12:02.360 --> 12:08.000]  still no one should be allowed to be armed in a barracks and I think you know
[12:08.000 --> 12:11.440]  their concern is you'll get younger recruits and people it'll get in fights
[12:11.440 --> 12:14.400]  and shoot each other well that's gonna happen anyways people are gonna get a
[12:14.400 --> 12:18.360]  gun with a bunch of trained killers who've been served serving five six seven
[12:18.360 --> 12:22.840]  tears look at sergeant Bales who climbed over the wire and killed 18 people
[12:22.840 --> 12:25.800]  torturing children burning them to death turned out he was on multiple
[12:25.800 --> 12:30.440]  psychotropics didn't know what planet he was on few years ago they're trying the
[12:30.440 --> 12:35.200]  guy right now they had a good guy walk around with a gun didn't know who he was
[12:35.200 --> 12:40.840]  like a zombie in a Walmart the cop walks around the corner and says drop the
[12:40.840 --> 12:44.440]  gun and the guy just ignores him walking like a zombie I would immediately
[12:44.440 --> 12:48.520]  that was a cop go around the corner and then you know shoot the person or
[12:48.520 --> 12:52.680]  whatever from from the concealment cop didn't do that got shot but the point is
[12:52.680 --> 12:56.560]  it's too bad he got killed I'm not making any judgment there I said then he
[12:56.560 --> 13:01.440]  will be on psychotropics probably ambient because nothing is as bad as
[13:01.440 --> 13:05.520]  ambient and again I'm not saying it's okay what sergeant Bales did or the guy
[13:05.520 --> 13:08.980]  in Austin Texas Rolls-Royce cases but the point is they might as well be on
[13:08.980 --> 13:15.200]  PCP folks and if you kill somebody on PCP you end up getting manslaughter you
[13:15.200 --> 13:19.160]  don't get murder or murder one premeditated because you don't know
[13:19.160 --> 13:25.160]  what planet you're on and that's the issue we're putting people that have
[13:25.160 --> 13:29.800]  served four five six seven eight nine ten tours in some cases that no military
[13:29.800 --> 13:33.440]  has ever done in history I grew up around a lot of World War two vets that
[13:33.440 --> 13:38.400]  served two tours and we're all screwed up to a certain extent they were all
[13:38.400 --> 13:41.980]  really nice but the type of people that would if you messed with them they'd
[13:41.980 --> 13:46.560]  kill you and the police even back then new pulling over old vets and stuff is
[13:46.560 --> 13:50.280]  incredibly dangerous people that have just served a couple tours because they
[13:50.280 --> 13:54.120]  just are not going to be pushed around and that's the issue you put people in
[13:54.120 --> 14:01.120]  hardcore stress in combat they're going to get what they call PTSD and you keep
[14:01.120 --> 14:05.680]  them in combat you put them on these drugs and this is a way to discredit the
[14:05.680 --> 14:09.320]  military folks they're now going to put them all on drugs monitor them all take
[14:09.320 --> 14:13.960]  all the military personnel's rights away out of hand give them quote anti stress
[14:13.960 --> 14:17.000]  vaccines they're announcing that literally destroy parts of the brain
[14:17.000 --> 14:21.280]  associated with aggression but also with endorphins and enjoyment and and
[14:21.280 --> 14:25.800]  religious experiences this is how you'll they come in and federalize the media and
[14:25.800 --> 14:28.920]  have it tell lies for decades and discredit it it implodes they come out
[14:28.920 --> 14:34.000]  with pure state run media after that run by the government completely they
[14:34.000 --> 14:37.920]  militarize and federalize the police then the police act like you know
[14:37.920 --> 14:41.280]  murderers the feds come in and fully federalize when they've trained them how
[14:41.280 --> 14:44.480]  to act like that and it's the same thing with the
[14:44.480 --> 14:47.880]  drugging and and the and the I mean the average military people I know in the
[14:47.880 --> 14:53.800]  Marines or the army have served five tours in combat I have family that has
[14:53.800 --> 15:03.040]  served over 20 tours 30 years in the US Army 20 tours in combat in Africa and
[15:03.040 --> 15:08.920]  South America and Central America and Asia and in the Dominican Republic and
[15:08.920 --> 15:13.200]  in the Middle East and Afghanistan and Iraq I mean there's a bunch of people I
[15:13.200 --> 15:19.520]  got cousins that are that are 50 years old folks 51 I mean that had been in 20
[15:19.520 --> 15:27.600]  20 combat tours 20 I was just thinking what do you mean 10 tours I was on the
[15:27.600 --> 15:32.480]  plane back from Las Vegas taping TV shows with the turf years ago and there
[15:32.480 --> 15:40.200]  was a senior non-commissioned officer going to take a guy that got killed by
[15:40.200 --> 15:44.440]  an IED Air Force MP he was an Air Force MP and we got to the cops were all there
[15:44.440 --> 15:48.600]  with the drape coffin and the big parade and everything out the Fort Hood but the
[15:48.600 --> 15:52.880]  point was is I talked to him for three hours flying back from Vegas and he had
[15:52.880 --> 16:00.080]  been in since 9-11 and that was two years ago he'd been in eight combat tours
[16:00.080 --> 16:06.080]  with only basically one year off himself being IED and shot at all over the
[16:06.080 --> 16:09.440]  world you know the point is he was pretty normal and pretty nice the the
[16:09.440 --> 16:14.600]  issue is most people would be completely screwed up from that and that's what I'm
[16:14.600 --> 16:18.520]  talking about ladies and gentlemen is my you know my cousin who's been in 20
[16:18.520 --> 16:23.160]  combat tours because I asked him I said how many oh about you know 20 of those
[16:23.160 --> 16:30.000]  30 years have been combat tours I mean that that's just unheard of folks Roman
[16:30.000 --> 16:34.640]  centurions didn't go for more than 10 years and by the by the 10th year you
[16:34.640 --> 16:39.880]  can read the history they were most of them complete murdering maniacs I mean if
[16:39.880 --> 16:42.520]  you didn't follow discipline in the Roman centurions they would get around and
[16:42.520 --> 16:47.200]  kill you just right there at the base this this is this is a total abuse of
[16:47.200 --> 16:51.000]  the American people and the American volunteer military and it's being done
[16:51.000 --> 16:55.680]  to ruin it and wreck it like a car you never change the shocks on you never
[16:55.680 --> 17:00.480]  change the oil on it's so evil and then they put them on drugs that the inserts
[17:00.480 --> 17:06.360]  say will make you into a homicidal murder and killer let's go to part of the
[17:06.360 --> 17:10.120]  press conference with our reporters this is up on info wars com army admits
[17:10.120 --> 17:21.960]  forwarded shooter was on psychotropic drugs was on psychiatric drugs I do
[17:21.960 --> 17:28.200]  not know I did not say his rank or his name and I'll do that when his family is
[17:28.200 --> 17:37.440]  appropriately notified at this time I prefer not he was undergoing a behavior
[17:37.440 --> 17:43.440]  health and psychiatric treatment for depression and anxiety there are reports
[17:43.440 --> 17:47.280]  I don't know if he was diagnosed in the clinical sense there are reports that he
[17:47.280 --> 17:52.080]  self-reported a traumatic brain injury previously coming back from the
[17:52.080 --> 17:57.760]  wreck was he on any sort of medications was on medications like SSRIs or
[17:57.760 --> 18:03.400]  anti-depressants anything of that nature yes was the FBI already on the scene
[18:03.400 --> 18:08.000]  due to the alert that they gave out about on Monday regarding a possible
[18:08.000 --> 18:14.800]  mass shooting we have a local FBI liaison officer but no large FBI
[18:14.800 --> 18:20.880]  assets were not here they are actually inbound help with the investigation all
[18:20.880 --> 18:28.600]  of the wounded and killed were going to try to describe what she did so it's
[18:28.600 --> 18:34.360]  clearly erotic what she did at that moment in time and and she did her job
[18:34.360 --> 18:38.000]  and she did exactly what we would expect of the United States Army military
[18:38.000 --> 18:42.000]  police what are your thoughts on how long it will take to kill one of our men?
[18:42.000 --> 18:46.080]  you're not allowed to carry a gun so well do you think that should change?
[18:46.080 --> 18:54.280]  no I don't think so we have law enforcement agents trained professionals and I don't
[18:54.280 --> 18:59.720]  know how long did you take for the law enforcement to reach the scene? it was
[18:59.720 --> 19:04.960]  within minutes within minutes exact time probably 10 to 15 maybe so you're
[19:04.960 --> 19:08.520]  saying that we should have concealed weapons but it still takes 10 to 15
[19:08.520 --> 19:12.040]  minutes for law enforcement to even reach the scene put your comments on that
[19:12.040 --> 19:17.560]  I think the law enforcement acted very rapidly and swiftly given the nature of
[19:17.560 --> 19:21.000]  this circle they understand that but there's still people that have died
[19:21.000 --> 19:26.200]  with your carrying weapons on a military institution. I just ask for all your thoughts and
[19:26.200 --> 19:30.680]  prayers for the fallen and for the wounded and the wounded in this particular case thank you very much.
[19:30.680 --> 19:35.240]  General, I know an old colleague here.

[19:45.120 --> 19:50.120]  potential for another situation. yeah there's no there's no link that we know
[19:50.120 --> 19:54.120]  of to that particular case. well we're gonna come back and play that last part

[24:51.360 --> 24:54.600]  people that have been in a few years I mean they could have a test you take or
[24:54.600 --> 24:58.760]  you know some type of certification and then just maybe get 10% of them armed
[24:58.760 --> 25:02.720]  at least I don't know about brand new people at boot camp with guns you don't

[25:16.440 --> 25:21.720]  Vietnam War in 1975 it is total stress disorder and they're using it to
[25:21.720 --> 25:28.280]  demonize all vets including the victims of being put in there and people say oh
[25:28.280 --> 25:32.960]  well you volunteered and clearly some people get in the military and get
[25:32.960 --> 25:37.360]  addicted to the culture and it's all they know and they stay in and some people
[25:37.360 --> 25:47.440]  can handle it like my cousin but most people cannot handle four five six
[25:47.440 --> 25:52.560]  combators you certainly can't handle 10 or 20 I mean that's that's literally over
[25:52.560 --> 25:59.200]  the top cartoon book level but that's the type of stuff that's going on and you
[25:59.200 --> 26:04.520]  know a lot of the reason we had 1776 was because of the French and Indian war
[26:04.520 --> 26:08.160]  that killed hundreds of thousands and was a vicious guerrilla war with the
[26:08.160 --> 26:11.760]  colonies against the French and large groups of natives and that's why when
[26:11.760 --> 26:16.200]  the British regulars to a lot of more snot noses and hadn't been in a lot of
[26:16.200 --> 26:21.280]  combat came into the colonies started pushing the veterans around 1776 happened
[26:21.280 --> 26:26.240]  and I'm telling you this homeland security demonization the military after
[26:26.240 --> 26:30.720]  abusing them and after putting them through all this and now they're moving
[26:30.720 --> 26:34.560]  to take their pension funds and stuff like that that's why the Pentagon says
[26:34.560 --> 26:37.800]  the number one threat and the and the and the homeland security is the vets
[26:37.800 --> 26:42.880]  because you're starting a fight with them this has happened over and over to
[26:42.880 --> 26:47.840]  get in history and it's not going to end well unless the system backs off
[26:47.840 --> 26:52.200]  right now all these crazy people like Joe Biden with no connection to reality
[26:52.200 --> 26:57.080]  all these con artists all these PR firms your BS is going to end your
[26:57.080 --> 27:03.840]  Obamacare all of it you fools run the country you're in power already why do
[27:03.840 --> 27:07.720]  you have an instinct to gut anyone who's honorable because you have a
[27:07.720 --> 27:11.160]  criminal instinct to hurt good guys you have a criminal instinct to eradicate
[27:11.160 --> 27:15.880]  anything decent when it's it's the decent system of checks and balances that
[27:15.880 --> 27:21.480]  has allowed you to even exist now you heard jacari Jackson and Kit Daniels
[27:21.480 --> 27:26.280]  are coming in the next segment ask the real questions was he under psychotropic
[27:26.280 --> 27:32.280]  drugs was he on issue drugs yes was the answer drugs that articles up on drugs

[27:44.920 --> 27:49.960]  horn why didn't the hundreds it looks like over a hundred reporters when you
[27:49.960 --> 27:55.040]  see wide shots of the raw video I mean there's got to be 20 or 30 flags up
[27:55.040 --> 27:59.000]  there you know microphones and the guys did a great job next time we need the
[27:59.000 --> 28:02.360]  remote kit which I know we have with the microphone and the cord and our guys
[28:02.360 --> 28:04.720]  you know but they got up there with handheld cameras and got the job done
[28:04.720 --> 28:08.880]  in the middle of the night next time we need to have those kits ready for no
[28:08.880 --> 28:13.240]  no pun intended for Kit and jacari to have those kits for all our reporters to
[28:13.240 --> 28:16.240]  be able to go to those press conferences and get really good audio but I give them
[28:16.240 --> 28:21.080]  an A plus for initiative and questions so great job to the reporters absolutely
[28:21.080 --> 28:24.840]  kick butt here in info wars let's go back to the end of that video that's up
[28:24.840 --> 28:29.280]  on drudge where jacari follows the general to his car that's what a real
[28:29.280 --> 28:32.880]  reporter does is he continues to ask questions
[28:32.880 --> 28:36.840]  general what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on
[28:36.840 --> 28:41.200]  Monday about a potential for the shooting potential for the situation
[28:41.200 --> 28:46.440]  yeah there's no there's no link that we know of to that particular case that we
[28:46.440 --> 28:49.320]  know we're investigating everything but there's no particular link I am aware
[28:49.320 --> 28:53.280]  that FBI report and there's no particular link to that that we know of very
[28:53.280 --> 28:58.080]  very suspicious the fact that they're not pushing anti-gun stuff out of the
[28:58.080 --> 29:02.080]  gates that they weren't ready for this I think this was a real shooting but you've
[29:02.080 --> 29:05.640]  got the FBI running around with army intelligence looking for a jihadi
[29:05.640 --> 29:10.960]  former military guy and then you've got all this other stuff going on it is
[29:10.960 --> 29:15.560]  suspicious but my gut tells me this is real if more comes out we'll I could
[29:15.560 --> 29:22.520]  change my view on that but this is this is 20 plus people a day 22 veterans a
[29:22.520 --> 29:29.600]  day committing suicide that's thousands a year folks it's off the charts bad and
[29:29.600 --> 29:33.320]  you're gonna have some of them aren't gonna commit suicide they're gonna go
[29:33.320 --> 29:37.040]  kill people they're mad at and then when the government starts to fight with the
[29:37.040 --> 29:40.480]  veterans they're gonna go out and start killing people and I mean if each
[29:40.480 --> 29:43.320]  veteran just goes out and kills one person that's it for the whole government
[29:43.320 --> 29:47.280]  so you know I got an idea let's not have this civil war how's that sound we'll
[29:47.280 --> 29:54.680]  right back we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the

[34:37.680 --> 34:43.120]  home base group but was so we can have another group of reporters that can then
[34:43.120 --> 34:47.600]  be sent places on a weekly basis because it really you know straps us

[34:58.440 --> 35:04.040]  few weeks but we need more reporters and I think the next wave we've done great
[35:04.040 --> 35:09.920]  hiring six reporters and then by attrition you know down to three or so
[35:09.920 --> 35:13.120]  with with Darren McBreen is back up and we've got our writer reporters that have

[38:04.840 --> 38:11.520]  plugging here the point is this is a free will free association broadcast we're
[38:11.520 --> 38:15.080]  not like as I say MSNBC they get stimulus money and make her bail out
[38:15.080 --> 38:20.960]  money we're not like NPR that gets upwards of $500 million in taxpayer
[38:20.960 --> 38:28.280]  money to literally push very slick fascist propaganda posing as liberal
[38:28.280 --> 38:32.840]  we are funded by you and please support our local AM and FM affiliates it is
[38:32.840 --> 38:36.720]  essential to support those local sponsors to become a local sponsor and
[38:36.720 --> 38:39.680]  to spread the word about the broadcast if you're listening to it if you're
[38:39.680 --> 38:43.200]  listening to us on the AM or FM station we're on all over the country over a
[38:43.200 --> 38:48.240]  hundred and going to 170 stations now we just got a 50,000 water two of those
[38:48.240 --> 38:53.480]  the last week I need to plug those the point is is that we're on a DC of a
[38:53.480 --> 38:56.800]  thousand water and that's incredible I need to plug that I just did the liner
[38:56.800 --> 38:59.880]  for it last week can I can I have that plug it on there I mean it's there's
[38:59.880 --> 39:05.120]  just so much going on and it's so exciting support those stations if
[39:05.120 --> 39:09.080]  you're listening to this on an AM or FM you can stop people in their cars at a
[39:09.080 --> 39:13.080]  red light and say tune into this station right now this is important or tell
[39:13.080 --> 39:16.080]  everybody at work hey when you go to lunch today tune into this or tell your
[39:16.080 --> 39:20.920]  boss or your employees about it this is how we warn people support those local
[39:20.920 --> 39:25.720]  AM and FM's they are so essential they have giant audiences it is a
[39:25.720 --> 39:30.200]  information warfare weapons system ready to be used and the fact that we've
[39:30.200 --> 39:35.840]  come so far that this show is seen as so mainline now because we've exposed
[39:35.840 --> 39:40.120]  what's happening you've exposed what's happening that that that we are accepted
[39:40.120 --> 39:44.720]  on big stations because the program directors and owners can go look and see
[39:44.720 --> 39:53.520]  yeah this sounds crazy but it's going on this guy backs up what he says knock on
[39:53.520 --> 39:57.080]  wood that's why I've not been sued for defamation stuff and why the few
[39:57.080 --> 40:01.120]  frivolous suits we've seen against this by folks before been thrown out most
[40:01.120 --> 40:03.960]  little media organizations get sued all the time not us because we know what
[40:03.960 --> 40:09.520]  we're doing and we've got lawyers and we and we we we do we do our best to tell
[40:09.520 --> 40:13.720]  the truth and we get things wrong occasionally we go and we report on how
[40:13.720 --> 40:17.000]  we're wrong we retracted that's a difference between us and dinosaur
[40:17.000 --> 40:23.560]  media that just take the report they're given and repeat it and talk radio is and
[40:23.560 --> 40:29.280]  was the original alternative media when print was controlled when the TV was
[40:29.280 --> 40:33.920]  controlled only three channels it was talk radio where people could call in
[40:33.920 --> 40:37.400]  and talk about things and so many stories would break regionally that would
[40:37.400 --> 40:40.800]  end up becoming very important and it was the place that could change what
[40:40.800 --> 40:45.800]  was happening legislatively government tyrants in government have always feared
[40:45.800 --> 40:50.000]  talk radio and everything they can to kill it now it's just like cash it's
[40:50.000 --> 40:53.280]  something we need to continue to use something we need to continue to support
[40:53.280 --> 40:57.440]  because they want to phase it out they want to get rid of farmers markets we
[40:57.440 --> 41:00.160]  support them they want to get rid of the Second Amendment we support it they
[41:00.160 --> 41:04.320]  want to get rid of borders we support it they want to get rid of the family we
[41:04.320 --> 41:07.120]  support it they want to force inoculations on us we're against it
[41:07.120 --> 41:10.400]  then you go to the research they're killing us with you know groups that do
[41:10.400 --> 41:13.960]  secret research over and over again the EPA it now turns out doing secret deadly
[41:13.960 --> 41:20.240]  test on kids that's in the news today I mean this is what's going on we're just
[41:20.240 --> 41:25.240]  the same people reporting on the insanity of the ruling class which
[41:25.240 --> 41:29.280]  throughout history becomes decadent look at Caligula marrying his horse look at
[41:29.280 --> 41:33.320]  what Hitler did look at what all these other crazy leaders have done
[41:33.320 --> 41:41.200]  vladian paler and craziness in government is the norm not the exception
[41:41.200 --> 41:45.880]  because even if you've got a good king and a good ruling nobility over time
[41:45.880 --> 41:49.440]  they degenerate their kids become spoiled their grandkids become evil
[41:49.440 --> 41:54.240]  their grandkids become flat-out satanic and you've got human sacrifice mass
[41:54.240 --> 41:59.840]  murder out of control police forces feeding on people this is the cycle and
[41:59.840 --> 42:03.680]  we're going into that evil cycle but there have been many cases in history
[42:03.680 --> 42:07.640]  where if people warn and people point out historically what's happened they
[42:07.640 --> 42:12.560]  call them prophets then you can not go into the depths of the evil cycle and
[42:12.560 --> 42:17.520]  get a reprieve and not go into slavery in every case in history when a culture
[42:17.520 --> 42:22.040]  becomes evil folks they go into bondage they lose the blessings of liberty we
[42:22.040 --> 42:26.480]  are going into bondage we are losing every basic freedom right now it's all
[42:26.480 --> 42:30.560]  under assault and there is a battle and a war for that freedom right now now I
[42:30.560 --> 42:33.600]  want to play this one more time because it's so powerful and some of it's got
[42:33.600 --> 42:38.280]  subtitles so see the video up on info wars dot com I want a red link army

[43:12.040 --> 43:19.240]  second amendment we're in an info war we have to point out that almost every
[43:19.240 --> 43:23.560]  school shooter has been on multiple psychotropic every time I hear about
[43:23.560 --> 43:26.680]  somebody like a zombie randomly shooting people are shooting a cop in

[43:38.600 --> 43:45.440]  and go shoot a cop at walmart wandering around like a zombie it's the drugs
[43:45.440 --> 43:49.520]  ladies and gentlemen and it's going to continue and look at our current issue

[44:07.240 --> 44:11.960]  questions about 15 feet from the commanding general of Fort Hood mark
[44:11.960 --> 44:17.360]  Milley which in a general and then we're gonna get the further breakdown from
[44:17.360 --> 44:21.560]  jacari jackson and kit Daniels here's the press conference how much indication
[44:21.560 --> 44:30.440]  do you have free meditation yes about pre-meditation I do not know I did not
[44:30.440 --> 44:34.600]  say his rank or his name and I'll do that when his family is appropriately
[44:34.600 --> 44:43.520]  notified at this time I prefer not he was undergoing a behavioral health
[44:43.520 --> 44:50.080]  psychiatric treatment for depression and anxiety there are reports I don't know
[44:50.080 --> 44:53.640]  if he was diagnosed in the clinical sense there are reports that he self
[44:53.640 --> 44:58.040]  reported a traumatic brain injury previously coming back from the
[44:58.040 --> 45:02.600]  wreck was he on any sort of medications was on medications that's correct like
[45:02.600 --> 45:08.960]  SSRIs or anti-depressants anything of that nature yes was the FBI already on
[45:08.960 --> 45:13.520]  the scene due to the alert that they gave out about on Monday regarding a
[45:13.520 --> 45:20.720]  possible mass shooting we have a local FBI liaison officer but no large FBI
[45:20.720 --> 45:26.800]  assets were not here they are actually inbound help with the investigation all
[45:26.800 --> 45:38.320]  of the wounded and killed with military what she did at that moment in time and
[45:38.320 --> 45:43.280]  and she did her job and she did exactly what we would expect of the United States
[45:43.280 --> 45:45.720]  Army Military Police
[45:45.720 --> 46:00.480]  we have law enforcement we're trained professionals didn't stop him from having
[46:00.480 --> 46:05.520]  a gun did it how long did you take for the law enforcement to reach the scene it
[46:05.520 --> 46:10.880]  was within minutes within minutes exact time probably 10 to 15 maybe so you're
[46:10.880 --> 46:14.440]  saying that we should have concealed weapons but it still takes 10 to 15
[46:14.440 --> 46:18.280]  minutes for law enforcement to even reach the scene put your comments on that I
[46:18.280 --> 46:23.480]  think a law enforcement acted very rapidly and swiftly given the nature of
[46:23.480 --> 46:30.000]  this sir they understand that but they're still people died that's good yeah
[46:30.000 --> 46:33.280]  yeah he can't get into the bait because they've turned military bases in the
[46:33.280 --> 46:38.560]  last 20 years into a victim disarmament zones and obviously if you live on the
[46:38.560 --> 46:42.120]  base you should be able to have a firearm it's like not letting pilots have
[46:42.120 --> 46:45.280]  guns in the cockpit when they did before 9 weapon they took them away right
[46:45.280 --> 46:49.080]  before that strangely enough you're gonna trust them with a giant weapon that
[46:49.080 --> 46:52.320]  goes 600 miles an hour they can take you know out thousands of people on the
[46:52.320 --> 46:56.840]  ground but they can't have a gun I mean this is this is a load of bull and it's
[46:56.840 --> 47:17.280]  about government and police having the monopoly of force most police and John
[47:17.280 --> 47:21.560]  down what was that you just played on here because I'm confused that was the
[47:21.560 --> 47:26.680]  announcement on the base oh yeah it's just showing that martial law and no one
[47:26.680 --> 47:31.360]  can be armed and you're on air right now right yes okay good good okay so yeah
[47:31.360 --> 47:35.000]  okay well that's powerful I wish we had it then we had that clip play that again
[47:35.000 --> 47:37.600]  for me
[47:37.600 --> 47:52.280]  yeah I can't really tell what's going on they're very interesting thank you okay
[47:52.280 --> 47:59.680]  let's go now to Jacarie Jackson and Kit guys other comments concerning the
[47:59.680 --> 48:03.840]  shooting and the fact that I want to say good job asking the real question was
[48:03.840 --> 48:08.280]  he under psychiatric care was he on drugs yes and the press conferences as
[48:08.280 --> 48:11.360]  you know you guys are the raw footage they're going on for a long time people
[48:11.360 --> 48:14.760]  are not asking the real questions it's ridiculous it was mainly a worship
[48:14.760 --> 48:18.960]  fast about oh what a great job you did you know stopping this guy yeah that's
[48:18.960 --> 48:22.400]  pretty much it and you know kudos to Kit you know he was able to get down in
[48:22.400 --> 48:26.560]  there low and ask the real questions and I was just so surprised how up front the
[48:26.560 --> 48:30.340]  general was when he said you know was he on psychiatric dress was he on the SSR
[48:30.340 --> 48:33.560]  eyes he just said yes which I at least you'll give him credit for admitting that
[48:33.560 --> 48:37.200]  I wasn't expecting to get that that's why I got to ask it up front before the feds
[48:37.200 --> 48:40.760]  come in and say hey let's not bring that up yeah that's what they usually do and
[48:40.760 --> 48:44.440]  then it comes out six months later so what are your thoughts about that kid
[48:44.440 --> 48:49.040]  well when I was about 12 years old I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and
[48:49.040 --> 48:53.600]  I was put on multiple SSRI's I know the dangers that they can do I remember when
[48:53.600 --> 48:59.560]  I was about 14 a doctor tried to force me to take medication which was an SSRI so
[48:59.560 --> 49:03.860]  took a piece of bubblegum stuck it behind my front teeth so when I opened my
[49:03.860 --> 49:06.760]  mouth he thought I actually took it because I knew I knew what it would do
[49:06.760 --> 49:11.040]  to me it turned me into a zombie but unfortunately the mainstream media
[49:11.040 --> 49:15.160]  they're not going to focus on the dangers of these drugs they are going to
[49:15.160 --> 49:19.160]  attack the second amendment and they are going to try to push for universal
[49:19.160 --> 49:27.000]  background checks and to for mentally for mental illness but the thing is the
[49:27.000 --> 49:33.960]  DSM-5 which psychologists use to diagnose mental disorders there's it's so
[49:33.960 --> 49:38.360]  broad that anything anyone could be diagnosed with mental disorder so
[49:38.360 --> 49:44.600]  universal background checks with under the guise of mental issues mental
[49:44.600 --> 49:48.840]  disorders it just leaves a gun confiscation well listen I remember in
[49:48.840 --> 49:52.840]  sixth grade about the tenth time kids that had flunked three grades were
[49:52.840 --> 49:56.120]  beating me up and I would fight back and push one I'm over and he had to go to
[49:56.120 --> 49:59.880]  the hospital they called my parents and they said we want to put your son on
[49:59.880 --> 50:03.680]  Ritalin and and maybe some other drugs and my dad's like you're the one there
[50:03.680 --> 50:07.640]  my son's being attacked by all your gang members he's done nothing wrong no
[50:07.640 --> 50:11.440]  I'm not putting my drugs and then the same thing continued to happen drug your
[50:11.440 --> 50:16.240]  son because he he stands up for himself yeah and the thing about it was is you
[50:16.240 --> 50:18.840]  know you trust these guys just like you said to go out there and fight for the
[50:18.840 --> 50:22.080]  country there they're trained in firearms proficient in firearms but then they
[50:22.080 --> 50:25.640]  say that you can't carry your own firearm on base and as kid pointed out
[50:25.640 --> 50:30.720]  that even with a police presence on the base they only had the what 15 minutes
[50:30.720 --> 50:35.440]  for a response time 10 15 minutes you know so it's not a very the average
[50:35.440 --> 50:38.720]  police response time is 12 minutes yeah so I mean even in a place where they
[50:38.720 --> 50:42.440]  have a monopoly on force they can't even use that force to protect themselves
[50:42.440 --> 50:47.480]  absolutely well that's it exactly and and now Paul Watson wrote the article
[50:47.480 --> 50:51.240]  should we disarm the whole military because with the people they say if
[50:51.240 --> 50:53.680]  somebody commits a crime we're all guilty right well then disarm the
[50:53.680 --> 50:57.080]  military we're gonna be right back I want to continue to break down this press

[54:33.720 --> 54:41.720]  ambient how many pages is this 20-something page adverse reactions and
[54:41.720 --> 54:46.680]  side effects abnormal thinking and behavioral problems 5.3 bizarre behavior
[54:46.680 --> 54:52.960]  agitation depersonalization and then it just it just goes on violent behavior
[54:52.960 --> 54:57.800]  suicide attempts abnormal thinking I want to get back to my reporters but
[54:57.800 --> 55:02.960]  this would take a long time to read all all 22 pages abnormal thoughts behaviors
[55:02.960 --> 55:06.320]  symptoms include more outgoing and aggressive behavior than normal
[55:06.320 --> 55:10.760]  confusion agitation hallucinations worsening of depression and suicidal
[55:10.760 --> 55:16.000]  thoughts or actions and I mean every one of these drugs is in the hallucinogen
[55:16.000 --> 55:21.720]  family and you put people on hallucinogens they're gonna have a bad
[55:21.720 --> 55:30.720]  trip sleepwalking and you add it to violent behavior I call that sleep
[55:30.720 --> 55:35.560]  killing and the general public's already in a trance like state these people are
[55:35.560 --> 55:40.160]  literally zombie killers and somebody makes them mad and they snap and they
[55:40.160 --> 55:44.520]  kill 18 villagers in Afghanistan and we give them you know 50 years in prison
[55:44.520 --> 55:50.000]  when the person admittedly said I didn't know who I was God served for Ters had
[55:50.000 --> 55:53.720]  part of his foot blown off had a prosthesis and they made him go back
[55:53.720 --> 55:59.440]  automatic re-up sergeant Bales and then he snapped when they put him on a bunch
[55:59.440 --> 56:02.920]  of medication because he was an IED attack and his buddy got killed so they
[56:02.920 --> 56:05.920]  put him on a bunch of new drugs and he flipped out and killed people and he's
[56:05.920 --> 56:10.720]  gonna be in a military prison forever because we can't admit it's the drugs we
[56:10.720 --> 56:16.800]  can't ever admit it's the drugs just more drugs so you have you're taking this
[56:16.800 --> 56:19.600]  pill now you have this side effects and that's give you this pill let's give you
[56:19.600 --> 56:22.800]  this pill to counteract that pill it's all about the pills you know instead of
[56:22.800 --> 56:25.720]  just giving these guys real treatment and trying to really help them and you
[56:25.720 --> 56:28.960]  know whatever area that they needed it's just they take this drug take more
[56:28.960 --> 56:35.120]  drugs that's the answer I mean you know if my son has allergies and has trouble
[56:35.120 --> 56:39.560]  sleeping the medical doctor says maybe send me put him on drugs I mean hey if
[56:39.560 --> 56:42.160]  you have a car right now they say well you're depressed put you on drugs right
[56:42.160 --> 56:45.360]  you know it's not your diet it's not your lives not you're getting enough
[56:45.360 --> 56:50.120]  exercise it's not that you're getting GMOs no you need drugs that make you kill
[56:50.120 --> 56:56.360]  people that's it that's exactly it as ties back into the war on drugs because if
[56:56.360 --> 57:00.720]  you and me were to take illegal drugs that are hallucinogens we get thrown in
[57:00.720 --> 57:05.520]  jail but if we are prescribed hallucinogens that are FDA approved well
[57:05.520 --> 57:10.000]  that's okay as long as big pharma gets its profits if you get your get your
[57:10.000 --> 57:14.000]  drugs from a reputable dealer a guy in a white lab coat then that's perfectly
[57:14.000 --> 57:19.000]  fine I'd never been allergic to bees and then I was in college digging out area
[57:19.000 --> 57:22.280]  for my parents put a garden in there paying me to do it and I was holing the
[57:22.280 --> 57:28.920]  ground up in a group of aggressive bees I probably got stung 15 times and they
[57:28.920 --> 57:31.680]  were gone it was during the day on Saturday I went into a shower put baking
[57:31.680 --> 57:36.280]  soda on me throat started shrinking up was about to call ambulance but kind of
[57:36.280 --> 57:40.560]  the only time in my life almost had like a hallucination and I felt like I was on
[57:40.560 --> 57:43.840]  you know a cloud nine or something and that's what I'm told it feels like when
[57:43.840 --> 57:46.760]  you're on these drugs I mean I could have done anything when those bees attack
[57:46.760 --> 57:51.760]  me yeah I mean I was out of my mind high off their poison yeah I mean I've I've
[57:51.760 --> 57:54.960]  never taken these drugs myself so I can't speculate to the effects but I
[57:54.960 --> 57:58.520]  definitely realize that because you see all these mass killers they say oh I
[57:58.520 --> 58:02.080]  thought I was in a video game I thought I was in some type of action movie you
[58:02.080 --> 58:05.040]  know it's almost like a Looney Tunes cartoon you know like you shoot the guy
[58:05.040 --> 58:08.760]  and his face it gets all smoky and then he's fine 10 seconds later that's what
[58:08.760 --> 58:13.160]  these guys think when they take these drugs no I dated some women before I got
[58:13.160 --> 58:19.000]  married who were on them and I mean these people are out of their minds and I'd
[58:19.000 --> 58:22.720]  known some of them before they got on and I'm not attacking people that are you
[58:22.720 --> 58:25.800]  know on this stuff and I'm sure for somebody might actually help them but
[58:25.800 --> 58:29.600]  statistically it's Russian roulette and I don't think we should put hardcore
[58:29.600 --> 58:33.240]  combat killers on yeah and if the insert says it'll make you do that and that's
[58:33.240 --> 58:36.640]  the whole point Alex because yeah and most people probably don't have these
[58:36.640 --> 58:39.320]  effects when they go out and commit some violence stay there to car Rick I'm back

[01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:31.160]  our final segment with our star reporters jacari Jackson and Kate Daniels
[01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:34.720]  they went out to the press conference at Fort Hood with the Lieutenant General
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:39.620]  commander of the base Mark Milley and asked he was he on drugs we psychiatric
[01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:43.400]  care oh yeah he was no one else is gonna ask that you see it in AP Reuters it's
[01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:47.080]  the big story nationwide I'm not tooting our horn it's just that we went and
[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:51.200]  asked real questions I mean what's wrong with these reporters jacari Jackson
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:54.680]  that they were there is you guys have tons of this press conference audio and
[01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:58.240]  video no one was asking the real questions but you guys well you know the
[01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:01.240]  thing about it was you know because last night I got this information right when
[01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:05.160]  we were doing the nightly news so I do the show and me and Kate flew out to to
[01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:08.280]  Fort Hood and when we get there the press conference I've probably been going to
[01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:11.840]  like 10 20 minutes before we got there you know kid Daniels to his credit
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:15.640]  jumps out of a moving car when I turn into the base run up to the press
[01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:18.960]  conference I go park the car and get over there and people asking you know you
[01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:22.040]  know what about the the police woman who stopped the guy you know another you
[01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:25.200]  know questions that are reasonable but you know Kate comes with the with the
[01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:29.080]  hard sale hey man it was the guy was he on the drugs you know what was he on
[01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:32.240]  drugs why was he taking the drugs you know what's up with the guns we allow
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:36.160]  the guys to carry concealed on the on the Fort Hood campus he says no the
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:40.280]  general says no because we have trained people here to protect you but as we saw
[01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:45.280]  on a military base they can't even keep you safe there that's it's sad to me
[01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:50.680]  that the military brass today has fallen so far away from the ideals of our
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:54.520]  founding fathers so when the second amendment was written the federalists
[01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:57.840]  and the anti-federalists they didn't debate about it it's hardly any debate
[01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:00.600]  about because they all believed in it they believe in the individual right to
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:03.320]  self-defense it was one of the only things that there was a debate on it was
[01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:07.280]  I mean they debated for months on the other stuff yeah absolutely but nowadays
[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:09.920]  it's like well we don't even have we don't even have second amendment anymore
[01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:14.040]  when it comes to military base even though they are defending our freedoms so
[01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:18.000]  it's like what's with this duopoly well they want to defend the freedoms of their
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:21.080]  own soldiers because you know we've we've got those leaked documents formed from
[01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:26.520]  Fort Hood but they say that if you're a evangelical or not just that tea party
[01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:30.480]  yeah all that but he also if you're a open carry the guys like to go out and
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:33.560]  open carry they say no you can't do that if you represent for it that's why
[01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:37.120]  they're saying we may court-martial you yeah and we've had the sergeant and
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:42.480]  others on was your master sergeant we will not allow you to be in second
[01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:46.200]  amendment demonstrations we might court-martial you back on base it's
[01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:49.040]  exactly right exactly right so they want to even stand up for the rights of their
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:52.560]  own soldiers yeah and the other that's because they're under the command of the
[01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:57.440]  globalist and this lieutenant Gerald just think if he said well yes I agree
[01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:00.440]  maybe we should consider concealed carry he'd get he'd get purged out of the
[01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:05.480]  military like that well he did seem better than a lot of them I mean imagine
[01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:08.480]  how honest his answers and straightforward were compared to the
[01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:11.840]  White House press secretary yeah I mean at least I was saying what he what he
[01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:14.320]  believed or at least he's been trained to be just giving you straight answers
[01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:17.560]  yeah yeah I mean he was saying now he was on drugs you have a psychiatric yeah
[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:21.400]  yeah so I give him that and I definitely give him that but you know
[01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:24.640]  definitely interested to see what else comes out of the situation you know
[01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:28.200]  people asking oh is this it is this again what do you think when you heard
[01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:30.840]  about it again because even when kid told me about it last night I was like
[01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:34.800]  for hood like again you know so and maybe we can get to the root of this
[01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:38.440]  problem well it's such a giant base yeah we get to the root of the problem where
[01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:42.080]  it's not just the firearm itself it's the person the action and taking
[01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:44.720]  responsibilities for those action I mean to quantify it's like to be like a
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:47.800]  city like Dallas yeah I mean there's hundreds of thousands of people go in
[01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:51.160]  and out of there every week it's just giants you're going to have stuff like
[01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:55.760]  this happen yeah my bottom line is do not blame the 2nd amendment yeah I mean
[01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:59.120]  that's what I told Pierce Morgan I said look you're prescribing mass murder
[01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:03.520]  pills you have the ads on for all these prozac type drugs that make people do
[01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:09.560]  this stop blaming gun owners for what your listeners do yeah but they didn't
[01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:12.720]  want to give up that that ad revenues let's let's change the question well
[01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:15.320]  they kicked me off they went to commercial and ended I was supposed to
[01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:20.080]  come back and they're oh oh I mean he was there to blame us like we killed those
[01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:23.520]  kids yeah Sandy Hook if you believe the official story in the blue screens and
[01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:27.160]  all the rest of it yeah but so it's all of us we're collectively bad but it's
[01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:30.680]  never talking about the real issues you know all the research done into these
[01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:34.280]  mass shooters being on these pills for several years now it's almost every case
[01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:39.040]  yeah I can't think of any case where they're not on it because normal people
[01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:42.800]  don't just randomly go out and start shooting people it just doesn't happen
[01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:47.840]  oh right I mean it's like people that are having a diabetic shock or something
[01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:51.360]  driving 100 miles an hour they don't know great job guys the videos up on
[01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:58.000]  info wars.com and rudgerport.com Ron Paul's coming up stay with us
[01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:05.200]  from the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself our world is
[01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:08.800]  becoming more and more toxic each and every day but it's not just the air
[01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:12.840]  outside that's toxic indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher
[01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:17.120]  concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90
[01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:21.040]  percent of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes there are
[01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:25.280]  more than 42 million smokers in the United States well over a thousand
[01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:29.120]  types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the
[01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:32.840]  fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well when

[01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:11.760]  because there's a war on for your mind
[01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:27.840]  ladies and gentlemen we are joined by the omnibudsman the granddaddy of the
[01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:32.160]  modern constitutional libertarian movement and his son is the US senator
[01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:36.360]  from Kentucky and all major polls the front runner to be the republican
[01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:41.760]  nominee and of course that's Rand Paul ladies and gentlemen former
[01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:47.040]  congressman Ron Paul joins us here today to cover the waterfront thank you
[01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:51.120]  for coming on sir he also of course has Ron Paul channel.com launching his own
[01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:56.440]  powerful multimedia TV print radio system I'm on affiliates all over the
[01:08:56.440 --> 01:09:00.200]  country that carry his daily commentaries and so I am able to hear those
[01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:05.560]  when I'm a guest very exciting to see Ron Paul and many others like Jesse
[01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:09.520]  Ventura starting their own media operations this will fully overthrow the
[01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:15.440]  old dinosaur media system it's already discredited itself. Dr. Paul out of the
[01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:19.280]  gates Fort Hood situation our reporters last night talked to the commanding
[01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:23.400]  general the videos on drudgereport.com they confirmed he was on
[01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:28.360]  psychotropic drugs and Ambien we're now learning is on multiple drugs what is
[01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:32.040]  your take on that as a medical doctor? Well obviously I think the drugs have a
[01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:37.000]  major role to play in this almost all the time whether there's high school
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:41.920]  shootings or wherever this occurs that they're receiving this government
[01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:46.880]  directed care for psychological problems and there are psychotropic drugs it's
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:50.880]  happening all the time so that's the immediate thing that crosses my mind
[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:55.640]  when when I hear of it and then when you hear of it being related to
[01:09:55.640 --> 01:10:00.800]  government and military and veterans you can be guaranteed that they're getting
[01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:06.480]  the wrong kind of treatment so medically I think it's you know that the
[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:11.360]  diagnosis is wrong the treatment is wrong and that we participate we may take
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:17.200]  one thing and make it worse I think what what's happened is they they look at
[01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:22.200]  these terrible acts and yet they're merely a symptom of something else and I
[01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:27.760]  think they never look for the cause why do people come back from war with this
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:33.080]  post-traumatic stress disorder and also the many brain injuries well it's the
[01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:38.800]  war it's the war that that's going on there and then when you think about well
[01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:44.160]  in medicine you know we want to prevent diseases but in politics it doesn't
[01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:47.440]  seem like they want to prevent the harm them because you know if you don't want
[01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:50.440]  these kind of problems why don't we have a different foreign policy you know
[01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:55.120]  this is a consequence so they create the conditions to jeopardize all these
[01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:59.400]  young people they come back they can't get jobs they become depressed we put
[01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:05.680]  them on drugs we make them a lot worse and we don't change our foreign policy
[01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:09.800]  we compound it we create them and we create the problem then give them drugs
[01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:14.320]  and make it worse and then everybody is just totally shocked how could this how
[01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:19.080]  could this happen you know and fortunately it's not happening more I
[01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:23.360]  think they've created conditions to which are so so terrible but the real
[01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:28.080]  tragedy when we hear about the killings and all but what about the hundreds of
[01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:33.400]  thousands now who are suffering and they're just falling you know talk about
[01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:37.320]  falling through the cracks these people are out on the streets and and they're
[01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:43.480]  begging for treatment and and yet my big beef is they never look at the cause you
[01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:47.440]  know we're in during the campaign we used to talk about I emphasize this whole
[01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:52.280]  thing of blowback maybe maybe we have a problem with terrorism war and terrorism
[01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:56.360]  because we have a deeply flawed foreign policy and there is blowback no they're
[01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:59.200]  not going to talk about that and they're not going to talk about wars that make
[01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:04.160]  no sense and that of course is what I would think is the important thing
[01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:07.400]  otherwise we're going to have this problem for a long time to come it's
[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:10.280]  probably still going to cost us trillions of dollars doing the wrong thing
[01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:16.360]  well you're an Air Force veteran and of course during the Vietnam era you you
[01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:20.400]  saw a lot of duty there back back even during Vietnam they only made him serve
[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:26.760]  one or two tours one of my grandfathers after he served his 22 flights in the
[01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:31.360]  Army Air Corps over Europe was on the ground in Italy and was shaken for his
[01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:35.560]  whole life by the starving Italian children and the horrors he saw in
[01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:41.200]  Italy and the rest of Europe that was just two years in the US Army and my
[01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:45.600]  other grandfather was affected by World War two and a crash he was in both of
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:49.480]  them in the Army Air Corps I just can't imagine these guys many of them more
[01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:54.760]  than 10 tours of combat now I don't think anybody mentally can handle that
[01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:59.440]  no and that is a big thing that is different even though these wars are
[01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:03.680]  seen as not nearly as violent as the other ones were a war killed hundreds of
[01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:09.200]  thousands you know and Vietnam killed a lot more but a lot of people went a lot
[01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:16.000]  of people were injured and damaged and and it's more than anybody ever
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:21.880]  imagined and they went back and forth so often they actually ended up in these
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:26.560]  these recent wars with more days in duty and worrying about what mine they're
[01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:31.320]  going to start step on and get and again get blown up but then there's the
[01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:37.440]  addition even though this problem existed in World War one and two but it
[01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:41.200]  wasn't generally talked about it talked about now but there's a lot more of it
[01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:46.200]  and some people would think well maybe maybe it has to do with the way we go
[01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:52.400]  to war you would think maybe it would have been a lot easier to adjust if you
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:56.960]  were knowing that you were fighting Hitler and you know this was a really
[01:13:56.960 --> 01:14:02.600]  really important war to win but now I think this compounds the stress
[01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:08.040]  disorder is when deep down in the heart I think a lot of them realize that this
[01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:16.240]  was all you know just wasted time and wasted life and wasted money and it and
[01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:21.680]  if they can't face that then I think they harbor those deep feelings and in that
[01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:25.920]  contributes to it and then all of a sudden the doctor says now give them
[01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:29.160]  appeal you know that's right I'm gonna make them feel better and again you're
[01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:32.840]  a medical doctor and a veteran yourself so you can speak directly this but that
[01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:36.800]  was well known after World War two that if someone thought a war was just you
[01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:40.640]  didn't have as many mental problems but if you don't think it's just you have
[01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:43.600]  serious problems and it was the Nazis that pioneered
[01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:51.120]  drugging their troops with amphetamines and proto-psychotropic so our military
[01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:56.460]  is following what the Nazis did but you know whether the war is just or not what
[01:14:56.460 --> 01:15:01.920]  if you are thinking about maybe this is unjust and then you suppress those
[01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:06.800]  feelings you don't express them it's suppression of some of these horrible
[01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:11.520]  thoughts I cannot believe our government would be you know do this you mean that
[01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:16.320]  this was all wasted life this was all done in vain if that is pretty hard to
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:20.520]  face up what if you lost a loved one isn't it very natural for you want to
[01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:25.480]  make them a hero and say well he didn't die in vain his life wasn't wasted he
[01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:31.280]  you know he died as a great protector of the Constitution and you know and so
[01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:35.880]  you have to suppress those feelings and I think that is where the the whole
[01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:40.920]  problem is compounded and then they then they go to the doctor for appeal and
[01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:44.160]  that makes the whole problem that much worse that's right former congressman
[01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:48.240]  Ron Paul is our guest right now they're on screen Ron Paul channel dot com
[01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:53.440]  excellent news media and liberty-based analysis with a truth bias if they like
[01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:56.640]  to tell the truth it's it's the opposite of the dinosaur media briefly
[01:15:56.640 --> 01:16:01.440]  dinosaur media's numbers are dropping about 24 percent a year according to
[01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:08.640]  Nielsen at this rate MSNBC CNN will have less than 100,000 viewers within two
[01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:13.840]  years one of our affiliates has ratings of over a hundred thousand listeners in
[01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:18.840]  three hours congressman what do you predicts going to happen when when my
[01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:22.920]  show has three million and the Ron Paul channel has millions and drudge report
[01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:26.520]  has 10 million a day all this what are they going to do we're already the real
[01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:32.000]  media what is the system going to do to counter this well you better they make
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:36.600]  efforts you know they try to think that they're competing by having a website
[01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:41.680]  and you know they can go watch videos and this sort of thing but the business
[01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:46.920]  is going to change you know I think the radio business will change and they're
[01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:51.160]  going to go more to independent radios and webcasting and all these other
[01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:57.120]  things that podcasting hopefully they're all put out of business yes but
[01:16:57.120 --> 01:17:02.960]  the tragedy will be is you know in a totalitarian country and we have a
[01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:06.640]  little bit of this here is where the government has to subsidize the media so
[01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:11.960]  you might see it might get much worse even though it's bad already even though
[01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:15.600]  it will not give us news and the people won't want it but they'll wreck you the
[01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:19.400]  people will recognize it but who knows it might mean that the taxpayer is going
[01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:23.080]  to be forced to pay for some of that stuff because I think the advertisers
[01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:27.840]  who still can make a market choice won't do it they're going to go to the
[01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:32.360]  different sites to advertise and target their advertisement that's why this is
[01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:36.320]  so attracted to so many of the people who are trying to sell products on the air
[01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:41.600]  I agree with you though they're going to pure state-run financed media to
[01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:45.480]  counter us and trying to censor the new media trying to censor web freedom but
[01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:49.640]  thank God you're there I know that's one of the main initiatives you've got Dr.
[01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:54.320]  Paul is to keep the internet free absolutely and it's gonna constantly
[01:17:54.320 --> 01:18:02.720]  being threatened and I'm all I don't know all the technology involved in how
[01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:07.480]  the internet works I'm betting on the free market and free individuals and
[01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:11.880]  that the fact that this is universal to come up and counteract everything that
[01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:18.720]  the government does you know get around it so I'm I'm hoping technology is the
[01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:21.840]  vehicle that undermines the authoritarianism that existed
[01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:25.480]  that's right that's what I'm hoping for that's why we can compete and innovate
[01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:28.800]  our way out of the tyranny that's our greatest renaissance hope all right in
[01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:32.000]  the four or five minutes we've got left sir I want to get into what you've
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:35.560]  really been focusing on so eloquently we've got a professor coming on later
[01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:42.680]  who backs you up this issue of what's unfolding over in the Ukraine and the
[01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:47.240]  demonization by state-run media of anyone that doesn't want to have the EU
[01:18:47.240 --> 01:18:50.960]  and NATO take over Ukraine I mean they've taken over 90% of the country they
[01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:55.160]  overthrew the government this is a big defeat for Russia as you said Putin's
[01:18:55.160 --> 01:19:00.520]  no angel but I mean the media over here is acting like Russia is starting World
[01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:04.400]  War three instead the West is starting a new Cold War do you agree with that
[01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:09.560]  absolutely that's what they're doing and there's I go back and forth from you
[01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:12.920]  know the American people are buying into it again they're listening to all the
[01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:17.360]  TV and going along with it but then I go and I look for a glimmer of hope and we
[01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:21.960]  find out that occasionally they'll do a poll and that poll will show the American
[01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:25.480]  people are still coming toward our position and saying no we don't need
[01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:29.680]  another war we don't need to you know be involved we don't need troops on the
[01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:34.880]  ground I don't think the average person on the street yet realizes how much money
[01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:38.960]  we put into messing around with the internal affairs of Ukraine for the last
[01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:46.760]  10 years plus you know with all the national endowment for democracies even
[01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:52.080]  Victoria Newland admitted they that the Department of State has spent over five
[01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:56.600]  billion dollars interfering you know with the government so yes there are
[01:19:56.600 --> 01:20:01.440]  problems around and like you said that we can't defend Russia as being the
[01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:08.880]  angels but if we if we just stayed out of it would be a big help when there
[01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:13.680]  was no help at all whatsoever for us to be involved there the evidence is so
[01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:21.160]  clear look whether it's Libya or Egypt or Afghanistan or Iraq Syria we're in
[01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:27.040]  Syria giving money and helping and aiding this the al-Qaeda so but I think
[01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:30.720]  the American people waking up they might not see it quite like I do about
[01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:35.120]  minding our own business and have non-interventions like our founders wanted
[01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:40.800]  but they're the conservatives are saying you know what we are broke you know
[01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:43.840]  there has to be a limit have you noticed that already that some people are
[01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:49.440]  saying well that we better wake up because you know that the bank is
[01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:53.320]  empty that's right doing is all they're doing is printing money so we have to
[01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:57.440]  quit well that's the issue is that the socialist and people want us bankrupt
[01:20:57.440 --> 01:21:01.240]  they want us dependent they want to wreck the golden goose so they can
[01:21:01.240 --> 01:21:06.040]  control everything two final questions for Ron Paul of Ron Paul channel calm
[01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:13.040]  dr. Paul looking at the presidential run hands down your son's the best candidate
[01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:17.120]  he's leading in all the polls Ted Cruz is also I think a great guy but I don't
[01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:20.800]  completely overall trusting because I haven't known him like I've known your
[01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:24.040]  son for 16 years since he was campaigning for you to get back into
[01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:28.920]  Congress for 17 years I do trust Rand he's done a great job how do we get
[01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:31.800]  behind Rand he's clearly gonna run for president now he started the
[01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:35.560]  exploratory group he's the front runner what are you planning to do to support
[01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:40.320]  him for president well mainly you know trying to get people to understand the
[01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:45.760]  issues because a person like Rand or myself or anybody that agrees with us
[01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:50.160]  the problem is that the general population thinks it's not in their best
[01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:55.800]  interest if you don't want to promote war and welfare well they want welfare
[01:21:55.800 --> 01:22:01.920]  well we have to do is educate people to the point we're realizing it's in their
[01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:05.760]  interest those people vote in their own self-interest and as long as they think
[01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:10.600]  they're going to get something you know the the big bankers know exactly what
[01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:14.160]  they're doing it's in their own interest but we have to get people to
[01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:17.520]  understand if they're in their best interest to vote for somebody like Rand
[01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:21.920]  and even if they want to even if they will be charged with saying oh they don't
[01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:25.480]  care about the poor people you've heard that enough they think that we we have
[01:22:25.480 --> 01:22:30.800]  no concern but the whole thing is if anybody had any compassion or any
[01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:35.800]  concern for the poor they ought to believe in liberty because the evidence is
[01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:42.000]  so clear that the freer country it is the more prosperity and the the greater
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:46.000]  chance that we have for peace but it's mainly getting that out mobilizing
[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:49.640]  people energizing people getting supporters sending money all these
[01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:54.480]  things are necessary for a campaign to be successful what about a Rand Paul Ted
[01:22:54.480 --> 01:23:00.440]  Cruz ticket do you think Ted Cruz would run his BP oh no you have no idea I
[01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:06.480]  imagine not too many people turn it down well I like Ted Cruz what's your view
[01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:12.920]  of him well I have hesitation about his foreign policy yeah I'm a little less
[01:23:12.920 --> 01:23:20.040]  interventionist than he is on foreign policy but you know he he's tough and he
[01:23:20.040 --> 01:23:25.280]  certainly agrees with this on the medical care system in this country and
[01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:29.920]  hope that it isn't what we ought to do speaking of that lastly Obamacare he
[01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:34.560]  says we can't repeal it 80% many polls are against it but the Republican
[01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:39.080]  leadership you know help write it as you expose what would you do sir to
[01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:43.280]  dismantle this everything you said about it has now come true your analysis was
[01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:46.760]  absolutely on target it's worse than we even thought in many cases it's
[01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:50.800]  bankrupting the country raising payroll taxes on poor people
[01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:54.800]  shred you know the architect of it is E.C. a manual admits it's meant to wreck
[01:23:54.800 --> 01:24:00.680]  the system I mean is it that criminal absolutely and if you could you know if
[01:24:00.680 --> 01:24:04.200]  you if you had a Congress to pass a law to repeal it you could the odds of that
[01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:10.280]  happening are very slim but there has to be a way that you can legalize freedom
[01:24:10.280 --> 01:24:14.920]  of choice to get out of an evil program you know and we sort of had that going
[01:24:14.920 --> 01:24:19.840]  but now with Obamacare it's been so de-emphasized and that is the right of
[01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:23.160]  you and I to get out take care of ourselves and get a tax deduction and
[01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:27.680]  have a medical savings account people were all just flocked to that once they
[01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:34.280]  realized you know that these lies about Obamacare you know our lies and that
[01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:37.760]  people aren't going to be very happy with it so we always have to have the
[01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:43.360]  right to opt out we always should have you know just in schooling you have to
[01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:46.520]  have a right to get out of the government schools you have to be able to go to a
[01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:50.720]  private school or to the homeschooling and when they eliminate that then we're
[01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:55.240]  in big trouble and then medicine they're essentially trying to do that for you for
[01:24:55.240 --> 01:25:00.320]  any of us to opt out of the system and right now there's a lot of unhappy people
[01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:04.320]  because it's based on pure authoritarianism well well a former
[01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:07.960]  Congressman Ron Paul Ron Paul channel.com thank you so much for your
[01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:11.400]  tireless defense of liberty and we look forward to speaking to you again in the
[01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:16.280]  future thank you sir all right there he goes just incredible the way he
[01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:21.200]  analyzes everything in fact he crystallized it Obamacare is a evil
[01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:27.040]  program it's an evil system we should have a right to not be part of it this
[01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:32.720]  is a basic civil god-given right the way described Ted Cruz as tough Ted Cruz is
[01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:38.800]  tough 28 hours not going to the bathroom staying eloquent I've tried to do a 24
[01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:44.640]  broadcast I can hardly do it I mean he's tough and you've got his wife's
[01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:48.800]  background on the council on foreign relations and Goldman Sachs it is not
[01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:54.440]  good but I follow the record of Judge a Tree by its fruits the fruits are about
[01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:59.520]  95% good with him they're about 97% good with Rand Paul they're not going to get
[01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:06.280]  elected unless they play some politics my gut tells me that Ted Cruz deep down
[01:26:06.280 --> 01:26:09.920]  does love liberty and understands the way the wind blows to that liberty's all
[01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:13.160]  things gonna save this country a lot of the establishment doesn't want to totally
[01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:16.240]  wreck the country just they just want power and I think Ted Cruz kind of
[01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:20.680]  represents that the non-insane establishment because the establishment's
[01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:24.120]  figuring out when real tyranny comes in there's not going to be a bunch of seats
[01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:28.720]  at the table whoever gets the ring of power in this new tyranny this
[01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:33.360]  technocracy is going to shut down all their competition everyone the common
[01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:39.440]  folks working-class middle-class wealthy nouveau rich ultra-rich the everyone
[01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:45.840]  you really don't want tyranny it stinks it's bad there's a small group of evil
[01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:50.560]  people who literally hate families literally hate God literally hate
[01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:55.880]  justice I've stated in all my 20 years of work 19 years on air no one ran Paul
[01:26:55.880 --> 01:27:04.320]  actually 18 since like 1996 in all of it it just comes down to these people want
[01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:10.760]  the power to persecute good people they want the power to control the media and
[01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:13.400]  tell an actress you got to have sex with me if you want to be in state run
[01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:17.840]  media they want the power to have the street signs the color they want they
[01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:21.600]  want the power to tell you how what your house can look like or what drugs your
[01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:25.480]  kids have got to take they want to run your life I don't want to run people's
[01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:29.800]  life I don't want to tell my crew what to do I want to lead them by example and
[01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:33.160]  show them how to defeat tyranny I don't want to sit there in pecking them
[01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:37.920]  standing over them telling them what to do all day well the establishment wants
[01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:43.360]  that and you talk to somebody like Ron Paul I mean he's the real deal folks and
[01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:49.680]  that's why socialists and tyrants and control freaks everywhere don't like him
[01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:54.360]  because collectivism destroys people collectivism makes people dependent
[01:27:54.360 --> 01:28:00.480]  collectivism makes people weak vicar Hugo the French philosopher said it best
[01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:06.960]  adversity makes men prosperity makes monsters adversity makes men prosperity
[01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:14.600]  makes monsters and that's the paradox liberty produces prosperity and then
[01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:17.800]  you get tyranny because people become decking it again how do you become a
[01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:22.680]  virtuous society that doesn't go back through that cycle like groundhog day
[01:28:22.680 --> 01:28:27.960]  over and over again I don't want a civil war I'm not stupid macho want some war
[01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:32.280]  with the government because I know the people in the government are brainwashed
[01:28:32.280 --> 01:28:38.120]  compartmentalized I want to free them I want them to join me and join our
[01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:42.520]  forebears and join the people that stood for justice and freedom but the people
[01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:46.800]  are going to have to lead folks for the government to follow we've just sat
[01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:49.680]  there and gone you're the authority you're the boss I'll do whatever you say
[01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:54.320]  well bad people get in charge we follow the orders and then that empowers the
[01:28:54.320 --> 01:29:02.560]  evil it blows wind to its into its sails we the people have to just not
[01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:06.000]  comply with corruption it doesn't mean across the board doesn't mean you don't
[01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:11.440]  have to pick your battles I don't fight everything on every front sometimes I've
[01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:14.640]  got a bigger mission I'm going somewhere and some bureaucrat or somebody gets in
[01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:18.720]  my way is violating me I just go like the water around them okay but then
[01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:23.160]  sometimes I decide to stand up against them sometimes I decide to go along with
[01:29:23.160 --> 01:29:28.040]  something in the system sometimes I don't I sit there and I judge these laws

[01:32:09.080 --> 01:32:13.120]  outside that's toxic indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher
[01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:17.400]  concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90
[01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:21.320]  percent of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes there are

[01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:36.800]  I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start

[01:33:03.440 --> 01:33:08.120]  there are of course those who do not want us to speak you think just let me
[01:33:08.120 --> 01:33:12.840]  think even now orders are being shot into telephones and men with guns will
[01:33:12.840 --> 01:33:18.360]  be on their way it's chances that damn it why because while the truncheon may be
[01:33:18.360 --> 01:33:24.240]  used in lieu of conversation words will always retain their power words are for
[01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:31.240]  the means to meaning and for those who will listen the annunciation there is
[01:33:31.240 --> 01:33:35.560]  something terribly wrong with this country isn't that you decided sir you
[01:33:35.560 --> 01:33:39.000]  wanted it for proof you told me every television in London cruelty and
[01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:43.040]  injustice intolerance and depression and where once you have the freedom to
[01:33:43.040 --> 01:33:47.920]  object to the thing can speak as you saw fit you now have sensors and systems of
[01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:52.880]  surveillance coercing your conformity in some cameras your submachine cameras how
[01:33:52.880 --> 01:33:57.320]  did this happen who's to blame well certainly there are those who are more
[01:33:57.320 --> 01:34:02.160]  responsible than others they will be held accountable but again truth be told
[01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:08.200]  if you're looking for the guilty you need only look into a mirror I know why
[01:34:08.200 --> 01:34:15.200]  you did it I know you were afraid who wouldn't be war terror disease there
[01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:20.000]  were a myriad of problems to conspire to corrupt your reason and rob you of your
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:24.840]  common sense fear got the best of you and in your panic you turn to the now
[01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:30.680]  high chancellor Adam Sattler he promised you order he promised you peace and all
[01:34:30.680 --> 01:34:35.920]  he demanded in return was your silent obedient consent
[01:34:39.920 --> 01:34:46.760]  there is a war it's happening now it will decide the fate of humanity the
[01:34:46.760 --> 01:34:55.360]  time to choose sides has come we are the resistance we are the info war that's
[01:34:55.360 --> 01:34:58.400]  right the only way to not give them their civil war they want to break the
[01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:03.280]  country down is to go info war 110 percent the enemy will still carry out a
[01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:06.640]  false flag probably that's the one question I meant to ask Ron Paul he
[01:35:06.640 --> 01:35:10.280]  keeps warning of criminal elements in the government staging false flags for
[01:35:10.280 --> 01:35:16.320]  war and domestic takeovers he knows the vicious stinking ace of spades they've
[01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:20.000]  got up their sleeve and the only way to expose it is that it's coming out of
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:26.640]  their sleeve when the false flag comes it's cheating we got to be watching
[01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:33.760]  slide a hand then pulling the ace out of the sleeve and I just keep looking for
[01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:36.520]  the ace card to keep watching for that there's some other stuff they can pull
[01:35:36.520 --> 01:35:41.440]  as well maybe a bio attack or they may claim it's naturally occurring they
[01:35:41.440 --> 01:35:46.280]  could do anything but out of a crisis they can maintain control unless we
[01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:50.480]  realize that the system getting more control doesn't protect us so we reject
[01:35:50.480 --> 01:35:54.840]  your control whether it's made up or real giving up our freedom doesn't
[01:35:54.840 --> 01:35:58.760]  protect us we want our freedom like Jesse Ventura says you'd rather face the
[01:35:58.760 --> 01:36:09.200]  danger I want no security at the airport arm the pilots and statistically you know
[01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:12.400]  the numbers you got a better chance of being struck twice by lightning and
[01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:15.880]  being grabbed by a hijacker even if they're real and most of the time it
[01:36:15.880 --> 01:36:19.920]  turns out it's staged you go out and you get on the highway every day and you
[01:36:19.920 --> 01:36:24.480]  drive 70 miles an hour on two lane roads with a car right beside you if you come
[01:36:24.480 --> 01:36:26.880]  out of their lane or they come out of their lane with a blowout and I've
[01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:30.560]  seen this happen I know you've probably seen it most of you most of you have
[01:36:30.560 --> 01:36:34.240]  seen a fatality crash you've had family that died in a crash why do you still
[01:36:34.240 --> 01:36:40.640]  get in the car kills 300,000 people a year roughly in the US alone you're
[01:36:40.640 --> 01:36:44.000]  going 70 they're going 70 you know what happens when you come out of your lane
[01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:48.840]  in the blowout and you hit them head on 70 miles an hour to 70 that's a hundred
[01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:53.840]  and forty mile an hour crash I don't care how many seatbelts you got on you're
[01:36:53.840 --> 01:37:00.240]  dead and I wanted to go out one day with a GoPro on the side of the truck
[01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:06.520]  sticking out six inches and show people this going down the highway going down
[01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:10.400]  these country roads with cars coming inches away and everybody's happy
[01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:18.840]  everybody's clapping kids are listening to music or you know playing games you're
[01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:23.520]  sitting there talking to your wife or you sit there and you got the 17 year old
[01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:26.920]  18 year old babysitter you know with your kids all the back of the car flying
[01:37:26.920 --> 01:37:31.560]  off to drive to gymnastics or whatever you're just calm by sweeties most
[01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:35.680]  dangerous thing in their life they're going to be inches from death the entire
[01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:42.120]  time and nobody's worried about it but then we're all shaking in fear of the
[01:37:42.120 --> 01:37:47.400]  terrorist that our criminal government publicly runs overthrowing countries
[01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:51.560]  everywhere and attacking our own military in Iraq you're like well why
[01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:55.040]  would they fund them to attack our military the simple-minded public I
[01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:59.200]  don't know why did that guy famously get caught breaking hundreds of windshields
[01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:02.640]  a night in New York because he owned the big windshield company and had the
[01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:09.560]  signs up everywhere the billboard saying get your windshield fix the cheapest
[01:38:10.280 --> 01:38:15.680]  why why do criminal why do criminal interests fund al-qaeda and fund them
[01:38:15.680 --> 01:38:19.920]  taken over and fund them attacking US bases in Iraq right now after they were
[01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:25.760]  done with Syria our government gave them part of Iraq our government gave them
[01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:31.760]  the heavy weapons and the medium weapons the kinetic weapons because our
[01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:35.000]  government isn't a government it's a group of criminals that want more defense
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:39.400]  contracting money and want the next war and the next war and the next war and
[01:38:39.400 --> 01:38:44.000]  so they can pull us over and have the cop believers terrorists everywhere and
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:48.840]  make us all suspects in a war on terror which they now tell us is the gun owners
[01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:55.240]  the tea party the returning veterans the Christians this is outrageous obviously
[01:38:55.240 --> 01:38:59.040]  this government is a group of out-of-control illegitimate hijacking

[01:40:11.520 --> 01:40:18.400]  the last 6,000 years of agrarian industrialized society agrarian up until
[01:40:18.400 --> 01:40:22.200]  about 300 years ago with industrial revolution but since civilization formed
[01:40:22.200 --> 01:40:31.280]  6,000 plus years ago government is hands down in every history book not
[01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:40.480]  debated the number one killer period it is like fire a dangerous servant and a
[01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:48.360]  fearful master towards Washington but you know the Fort Hood documents that
[01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:54.600]  army intelligence leaked to us that then got on Fox News and everywhere else
[01:40:54.600 --> 01:40:57.880]  CNN covered it and said well it is reasonable that you should be arrested
[01:40:57.880 --> 01:41:02.120]  if you're part of the Tea Party or or Aviva Evangelical Christian they said
[01:41:02.120 --> 01:41:09.800]  the founding fathers would not be welcome in today's military ladies and
[01:41:09.800 --> 01:41:16.120]  gentlemen the founding fathers George Washington founded the US Army the

[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:58.480]  this stuff is directly out of a science fiction Stanley Kubrick Clockwork Orange
[01:42:58.480 --> 01:43:03.320]  if you put stuff in Clockwork Orange a Clockwork Orange this bizarre no one
[01:43:03.320 --> 01:43:11.920]  would have believed it in the 70s I mean it's that completely insane I said this
[01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:15.920]  yesterday there is no other government that puts out more ridiculous stuff that
[01:43:15.920 --> 01:43:20.400]  is more absurdist cartoonish should be the type of stuff that this credits
[01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:27.160]  Obama and the Democrats I mean it is a war against reality it is lies you know
[01:43:27.160 --> 01:43:31.360]  Matt drudge is lying there's no penalty if you don't buy Obamacare it's in the

[01:43:35.200 --> 01:43:39.280]  and their response is Matt drudge is a liar tall tales it don't exist that's
[01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:45.000]  literally like saying the Sun didn't come up this morning I mean it is a
[01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:53.440]  manifest total war on reality ladies and gentlemen and they play games and go
[01:43:53.440 --> 01:43:58.080]  well it doesn't kick in for most people till next year because sadly most people
[01:43:58.080 --> 01:44:00.680]  don't have employees
[01:44:01.840 --> 01:44:07.560]  most people work for these global corporations now I'm ranting here I
[01:44:07.560 --> 01:44:11.920]  just don't even I know what to do I realize the psychological warfare that
[01:44:11.920 --> 01:44:16.000]  they're engaged in it is an attempt to create learned helplessness a cognitive
[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:19.340]  dissidence to just overwhelm the circuits and to condition us and
[01:44:19.340 --> 01:44:23.760]  inoculate us to accept total lies they know they can't cover up what's
[01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:26.880]  happening anymore so they're just going to set the precedent where they can
[01:44:26.880 --> 01:44:32.280]  commit any crime walk all over us tell lies get away with everything they are
[01:44:32.280 --> 01:44:37.400]  just training they know we caught them crapping in the pool so their answer is
[01:44:37.400 --> 01:44:41.920]  to crap 10 million times in the pool where and just tell you no blue water
[01:44:41.920 --> 01:44:47.680]  isn't blue anymore it's black get in it I mean that's basically I hate to use a
[01:44:47.680 --> 01:44:53.400]  gross analogy but does that analogy work guys because big it's nasty but
[01:44:53.400 --> 01:44:58.160]  effective but I mean that's really what it is it's just there are in a war with
[01:44:58.160 --> 01:45:02.280]  reality and goodness they are overthrowing common sense and they are
[01:45:02.280 --> 01:45:10.320]  practicing lies on us you see what I'm saying CJ yeah but sure but I mean look
[01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:15.440]  look Bill Clinton didn't lie this much Bush didn't lie this much Putin the
[01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:20.080]  Russians don't lie like this Merkel doesn't lie like this they just go yes
[01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:24.200]  the government has special vaccines don't worry about it because they know
[01:45:24.200 --> 01:45:29.440]  it's discredits to lie and get caught lying over and over again but with the
[01:45:29.440 --> 01:45:33.520]  Democrats they've gone with this confidence game thing where they just go
[01:45:33.520 --> 01:45:38.280]  everyone loves Obamacare everyone wants to turn their guns in everyone wants
[01:45:38.280 --> 01:45:44.080]  open borders everyone loves GMO everyone loves Michelle Obama everyone loves
[01:45:44.080 --> 01:45:48.400]  world government everyone loves teaching five-year-olds how to have anal sex you
[01:45:48.400 --> 01:45:53.800]  know it's just a crazy town Alex Obama has something that other leaders don't
[01:45:53.800 --> 01:45:59.040]  that's peer pressure peer pressure peer pressure no that's it it's like you've
[01:45:59.040 --> 01:46:04.260]  got to buy in to the trendiness and Nancy Pelosi in her $3,000 sports jacket
[01:46:04.260 --> 01:46:10.480]  dress with the pop collar and and she's confident and she sits up there and says
[01:46:10.480 --> 01:46:15.600]  everyone loves it what's the problem should they say we're hoaxing when we
[01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:21.040]  expose their hoax and so I guess that's all it is is a bunch of grandstanding
[01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:25.160]  thinking you're so stupid out there that you will buy absolutely anything
[01:46:25.160 --> 01:46:29.280]  everything they do and I think that's what it comes I mean talk about a hoax
[01:46:29.280 --> 01:46:40.200]  folks almost every mass shooter has been on SSRIs or on ambient I'm talking
[01:46:40.200 --> 01:46:43.680]  about locally the last three or four people that just randomly shot somebody
[01:46:43.680 --> 01:46:50.040]  for no reason I said they'll be on it they were on it not one thing out of the
[01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:53.040]  Austin Police Department next time at Ace of Eight is in here I'm gonna bring up
[01:46:53.040 --> 01:46:56.000]  that cop that got killed in Walmart I'm gonna say why didn't you call for an
[01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:00.040]  investigation of people on SSRIs well that's for the mental health
[01:47:00.040 --> 01:47:05.120]  professionals to do well no it's for everybody's job it's like breast
[01:47:05.120 --> 01:47:08.520]  cancer is up multi-thousand percentage points in women in the United States
[01:47:08.520 --> 01:47:14.960]  leading the world I saw the statistics last year I think you're over a hundred
[01:47:14.960 --> 01:47:18.200]  times it was likely in the US to get breast cancer than if you live in some
[01:47:18.200 --> 01:47:24.760]  place like Brazil there's no discussion of why is it skyrocketing it's all let's
[01:47:24.760 --> 01:47:31.920]  find a way to cure it see it's like every time there's a mass shooting every
[01:47:31.920 --> 01:47:39.360]  time I cannot find cases where they weren't on psychotropic drugs so there's
[01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:45.000]  no discussion of why is this going on there's never I mean there were over a
[01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:49.220]  hundred reporters at that press conference and Jakari Jackson and Kit
[01:47:49.220 --> 01:47:53.960]  Daniels our reporters pulled up right as it began ran up and asked the
[01:47:53.960 --> 01:47:59.080]  questions at the end of the press conference no one it was all about well
[01:47:59.080 --> 01:48:02.600]  the female cop that showed up you know that made him shoot himself and stop it
[01:48:02.600 --> 01:48:06.120]  you know she's a hero tell us about her let's talk about that hero cop again
[01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:09.080]  because that's what they want give me hero cops give me because it's a prime
[01:48:09.080 --> 01:48:12.760]  directive and fine give me a hero cop story but can we have other questions
[01:48:12.760 --> 01:48:16.640]  here please is it always it to be the hero cop see everyone has been trained
[01:48:16.640 --> 01:48:27.200]  to ask mindless pop culture trendy peer pressure garbage questions and and you
[01:48:27.200 --> 01:48:30.520]  know quite frankly I think if you sign up to be an MP and somebody's shooting
[01:48:30.520 --> 01:48:34.080]  people I don't think you're a hero if you run up start shooting at them I think
[01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:38.880]  you're doing your job I'm not taken away it just it does have to be every time
[01:48:38.880 --> 01:48:43.120]  hero cop hero cop can we say hero cop again let's yeah let's say that fit 10
[01:48:43.120 --> 01:48:47.520]  more times and then if I turn on the news let's let's hear about hero cops all
[01:48:47.520 --> 01:48:52.360]  day and then if I watch a movie he more hero cops and then more hero cops see
[01:48:52.360 --> 01:48:57.180]  the idea is only cops can be heroes only government can be heroes and now
[01:48:57.180 --> 01:49:02.800]  the military can't have guns because they're not the hero cops they can't be
[01:49:02.800 --> 01:49:08.320]  trusted really they can't be trusted
[01:49:09.560 --> 01:49:13.000]  statistically the military kill themselves they don't kill people very
[01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:17.080]  low crime rate in veterans you can look up the numbers we know where the high
[01:49:17.080 --> 01:49:22.120]  crime rates are ladies and gentlemen they're in the drug infested gangster
[01:49:22.120 --> 01:49:26.640]  culture that is taking over the country that Hollywood and MTV promote
[01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:36.080]  that's where the crime is again more psych warfare more garbage more murders
[01:49:36.080 --> 01:49:41.640]  more trash but every time you hear about some mother of three drowning all
[01:49:41.640 --> 01:49:44.840]  three of her kids are all five of her kids are chopping their arms off of meat
[01:49:44.840 --> 01:49:49.920]  cleavers it always comes out weeks later they were on psychotropic every time
[01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:53.200]  the cops pull up and a woman's dancing naked cutting herself would butcher knives
[01:49:53.200 --> 01:49:56.080]  that's a true story they know immediately they're what they're gonna find in
[01:49:56.080 --> 01:50:00.640]  medicine cabinet everybody knows what's doing this every time a soldier goes
[01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:04.480]  crazy and goes and kills 18 innocent people or 10 innocent people they're
[01:50:04.480 --> 01:50:12.760]  on these drugs every stinking time the drugs are the issues not our guns and
[01:50:12.760 --> 01:50:18.280]  I know you know that you better get that out to everybody Matt drugs took our
[01:50:18.280 --> 01:50:22.560]  article put it up at drugs report calm you need to get our article it places

[01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:39.440]  responsible for this more than anybody we're not responsible but they're gonna
[01:50:39.440 --> 01:50:44.000]  collectively the social engineers blame us and blame all veterans and take
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:47.560]  their rights away as well so in the info war we've got to get these stories and
[01:50:47.560 --> 01:50:51.920]  get them out I've got geopolitical news coming up on a host of issues and a lot

[01:54:18.960 --> 01:54:23.400]  yeah that red coat we're sending packing appears Morgan who has armed bodyguards
[01:54:23.400 --> 01:54:29.760]  he's blaming the second amendment for the mass shooting that for a military
[01:54:29.760 --> 01:54:37.920]  base active duty soldier on psychotropic on drugs should people he's mad at and
[01:54:37.920 --> 01:54:42.240]  I'm to blame so we need to take the guns out of the military I mean who can have
[01:54:42.240 --> 01:54:44.520]  got it we're gonna blame people collectively then you got to take the
[01:54:44.520 --> 01:54:48.640]  military's guns just like we did the report back at the time and said should
[01:54:48.640 --> 01:54:52.200]  we ban cars because somebody ran over 25 people killing a bunch of them at
[01:54:52.200 --> 01:54:55.680]  South by Southwest and we went out and the more liberal and trendy someone was
[01:54:55.680 --> 01:55:03.720]  they said yes ban cars it's the cars fall no idiots man you're stupid it is
[01:55:03.720 --> 01:55:09.760]  not the cars fault but they're coming out with robot cars now where oh the car
[01:55:09.760 --> 01:55:13.040]  will see if you're driving too fast or violently and won't let you do it see
[01:55:13.040 --> 01:55:17.100]  prior restraint which is total surveillance total control total
[01:55:17.100 --> 01:55:24.240]  slavery that's what this technocracy is and these little self-propelled traders
[01:55:24.240 --> 01:55:29.800]  these trendies that totally trust the system and are as dumb as the day is
[01:55:29.800 --> 01:55:35.840]  long literally most of them in Austin said ban cars the day after because it's
[01:55:35.840 --> 01:55:41.120]  the cars fault you understand that it's not the cars fault it's not the butcher's
[01:55:41.120 --> 01:55:45.480]  knife's fault it's not the baseball bats fault just like I told Pierce Morgan
[01:55:45.480 --> 01:55:51.080]  when the women getting raped with the with the iron rods in India it's not the
[01:55:51.080 --> 01:55:56.600]  iron rods fault but see if they can make it the fault of that they can take
[01:55:56.600 --> 01:56:00.400]  your right to have a butcher knife or to have a baseball bat or to have a car
[01:56:00.400 --> 01:56:05.360]  and they're going to do it with the technocracy we think I'm joking just
[01:56:05.360 --> 01:56:11.200]  search shop by Southwest trendies want to ban cars and they want to ban they
[01:56:11.200 --> 01:56:15.600]  want to ban now they'll probably get a band because they are the rulers of
[01:56:15.600 --> 01:56:19.960]  earth the dumbest are the people that the government sits there and and
[01:56:19.960 --> 01:56:25.040]  empowers to run our lives all the elite fly around in private jets
[01:56:25.280 --> 01:56:29.400]  British doctors call for ban a long kitchen knives to instabbing yes yes
[01:56:29.400 --> 01:56:32.360]  because somebody can't take a piece of sheet metal and make a knife I mean this
[01:56:32.360 --> 01:56:36.000]  is how it works ladies and gentlemen
[01:56:37.160 --> 01:56:41.880]  now continuing here ladies and gentlemen I've got a very important
[01:56:41.880 --> 01:56:49.200]  article dealing with what's happening over in the Middle East and other areas
[01:56:49.200 --> 01:56:53.040]  this is out of Bloomberg and they report on this with great horror
[01:56:53.040 --> 01:57:01.560]  Putin defies Obama in Syria as arms fuel Assad reassurgence and they imply it's
[01:57:01.560 --> 01:57:05.280]  terrible Assad the evil one has taken over no Assad the evil one was attacked
[01:57:05.280 --> 01:57:09.320]  three plus years ago by NATO forces backing al-Qaeda and then the Russians
[01:57:09.320 --> 01:57:12.240]  backed them up to keep their only deep water port there in the Mediterranean
[01:57:12.240 --> 01:57:17.400]  and so this the headline should be Putin helps sovereign nation battle Western
[01:57:17.400 --> 01:57:22.560]  al-Qaeda forces president Vladimir Putin condemned by NATO over annex and
[01:57:22.560 --> 01:57:27.240]  Crimea is now defying the U.S. and Syria by sending more and deadlier arms to
[01:57:27.240 --> 01:57:31.240]  help Bashar Assad score a string of advances against insurgents military
[01:57:31.240 --> 01:57:34.680]  experts say Assad's army seeking to end three years of the war that's killed a
[01:57:34.680 --> 01:57:37.720]  hundred fifty thousand no it's a proxy war started by the west that killed
[01:57:37.720 --> 01:57:42.120]  her hundred thousand people and displaced nine million started using longer range
[01:57:42.120 --> 01:57:47.880]  Russian smirch and Ergon rockets for the first time in February according to
[01:57:47.880 --> 01:57:53.120]  Jane's Defense weapons and Stratford a US geopolitical research company Syria has
[01:57:53.120 --> 01:57:58.040]  also intensified the use of MiG-29 fighter jets with ground attack

[01:58:07.160 --> 01:58:12.520]  convincingly said a Middle Eastern analyst with Moscow Carnegie Center by
[01:58:12.520 --> 01:58:15.720]  phone if Russia can show it's capable of carrying out its own foreign policy
[01:58:15.720 --> 01:58:21.240]  regardless of American wishes it will be a major achievement for pooty-poot then

[02:00:12.600 --> 02:00:20.080]  he he's alex jones on the GCM radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:20.080 --> 02:00:23.720]  alex jones
[02:00:33.680 --> 02:00:38.480]  all right we got a constitutional law professor joining us in the next segment
[02:00:38.480 --> 02:00:44.160]  to look at the annexation of Crimea but but tying that into how the globalist
[02:00:44.160 --> 02:00:48.040]  they go in and break up countries that have annexation happen into zones they
[02:00:48.040 --> 02:00:51.640]  control but then if anybody else actually tries to self-determine they
[02:00:51.640 --> 02:00:56.760]  try to stop that so this is a very important issue talking about Texas
[02:00:56.760 --> 02:01:04.440]  secession and a lot more coming up in the next segment again we've been telling
[02:01:04.440 --> 02:01:08.160]  you about this for years it is now in the times of London and they're reporting
[02:01:08.160 --> 02:01:12.160]  it like it's a straight face the headline should be outrage British
[02:01:12.160 --> 02:01:17.320]  government goes full authoritarian you've got members of parliament you've got
[02:01:17.320 --> 02:01:21.520]  members of the executive branch you've got members like the mayor of London
[02:01:21.520 --> 02:01:26.040]  calling for basically arresting conservative and libertarian parents
[02:01:26.040 --> 02:01:30.800]  and taking their kids because they can't deal with the opposition they are
[02:01:30.800 --> 02:01:36.520]  authoritarians well this is the calm headline crackdown ordered on a
[02:01:36.520 --> 02:01:42.400]  climate change skeptics crackdown and they report that like that's normal
[02:01:42.400 --> 02:01:49.280]  headline should be is England falling into total authoritarianism no it's in
[02:01:49.280 --> 02:01:55.800]  the news all the time arrest climate deniers arrest Lord Moncton oh yes let's
[02:01:55.800 --> 02:01:59.000]  just arrest him because he's been proven right and now they admit the earth is
[02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:03.040]  cooling and they admit and we've got all these serious environmental issues and
[02:02:03.040 --> 02:02:14.200]  it doesn't matter we've got to sit there and turn over our whole society these
[02:02:14.200 --> 02:02:18.160]  people let them tax everything and control our lives and ban wood stoves
[02:02:18.160 --> 02:02:23.600]  because they're saving us from carbon dioxide ministers who question the
[02:02:23.600 --> 02:02:28.600]  majority view it's not a majority view but talk about like some kind of cult
[02:02:28.600 --> 02:02:34.560]  Soviet thing those that question the majority view will be disappeared
[02:02:34.560 --> 02:02:39.200]  ministers who question the majority view among scientists about climate change
[02:02:39.200 --> 02:02:43.160]  should shut up and instead repeat the government line on the issue according
[02:02:43.160 --> 02:02:47.800]  to members of parliament the BBC should also give less airtime to climate
[02:02:47.800 --> 02:02:51.920]  skeptics and its editors should seek special clearance to interview them
[02:02:51.920 --> 02:02:56.200]  according to common science and technology committee Andrew Miller the
[02:02:56.200 --> 02:03:00.720]  committee's labor chairman said that appearances on radio and television by
[02:03:00.720 --> 02:03:05.720]  climate skeptics such as Lord Lawson I want to get him on the former Chancellor
[02:03:05.720 --> 02:03:11.280]  the Exchequer should be accompanied by health warnings oh really like Al Gore
[02:03:11.280 --> 02:03:15.200]  film got stopped showing to the British kids and the UK kids because it said
[02:03:15.200 --> 02:03:22.600]  polar bears couldn't swim stuff like that I mean these people aren't a fraud but
[02:03:22.600 --> 02:03:25.880]  when it comes out there for all they just say you know what we're gonna not let
[02:03:25.880 --> 02:03:30.480]  you have any free speech and this is a serious article introducing the idea we
[02:03:30.480 --> 02:03:36.600]  have other articles where they're openly calling for arrest mr. Miller link
[02:03:36.600 --> 02:03:43.520]  climate skeptics to a monster raving loony party whatever that means and then
[02:03:43.520 --> 02:03:50.880]  it goes on so there is the ongoing demonization it's like Jesse Ventura in
[02:03:50.880 --> 02:03:56.520]  the band FEMA special that I basically consulted and almost produced I mean I
[02:03:56.520 --> 02:04:00.320]  just the whole research and of course was in it I'm just proud of the fact that
[02:04:00.320 --> 02:04:04.160]  they banned the one episode that I've had my hands completely in most episodes
[02:04:04.160 --> 02:04:07.520]  got interviewed and gave some consulting that one I basically helped me all the
[02:04:07.520 --> 02:04:11.640]  research travel all the country with them and they banned it after it aired
[02:04:11.640 --> 02:04:15.280]  one time and pulled it off the Teavos and he goes into the congressman he says
[02:04:15.280 --> 02:04:20.120]  yeah this bill to expand the FEMA camps the emergency centers established
[02:04:20.120 --> 02:04:23.720]  from that and the guy went there is no bill he was obviously lying Tennessee
[02:04:23.720 --> 02:04:28.280]  congressman and then he goes well I got a copy of it right here you spawn you I
[02:04:28.280 --> 02:04:36.520]  mean you wrote it he goes oh that bill I say I say I say something like the
[02:04:36.520 --> 02:04:43.160]  hoghorn leghorn and but before that he goes I see governor you believe that
[02:04:43.160 --> 02:04:49.520]  space aliens are gonna come down out of the sky and eat me too and put on like
[02:04:49.520 --> 02:04:53.720]  this fake Southern or action Jesse goes no I mean the bill you sponsored he goes
[02:04:53.720 --> 02:05:00.760]  there is no bill and he hands in the building goes oh I declare that bill in
[02:05:00.760 --> 02:05:05.760]  the last 50 years iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced
[02:05:05.760 --> 02:05:11.520]  with the halogen bromine a practice now banned in nations around the world guess
[02:05:11.520 --> 02:05:15.880]  what else is in a halogen family fluoride ladies and gentlemen Alex Jones here
[02:05:15.880 --> 02:05:20.720]  in 1924 the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt
[02:05:20.720 --> 02:05:25.920]  producers to add iodine it's the good halogen on the periodic table and the
[02:05:25.920 --> 02:05:32.040]  results are on record reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had

[02:09:09.560 --> 02:09:13.560]  Fighting the good fight my friends
[02:09:13.560 --> 02:09:19.560]  Robert Lecker is our guest, a Harvard Law School graduate, criminal law professor
[02:09:19.560 --> 02:09:26.560]  at New York Law School and he joins us he's formerly prosecuted corruption
[02:09:26.560 --> 02:09:30.560]  New York's criminal justice system as a special assistant attorney general and
[02:09:30.560 --> 02:09:34.560]  has been the sole keynote speaker supporting the death penalty at several
[02:09:34.560 --> 02:09:38.560]  major conferences around the globe he is also the author of the death of
[02:09:38.560 --> 02:09:42.560]  punishment searching for justice among the worst of the worst he's with us for
[02:09:42.560 --> 02:09:45.560]  the next two segments we're probably getting back on the death penalty subject
[02:09:45.560 --> 02:09:49.560]  down the road we just had former congressman Ron Paul on
[02:09:49.560 --> 02:09:53.560]  in the last hour who's written articles pointing out that you've got
[02:09:53.560 --> 02:09:57.560]  secession in Catalonia Spain you've got secession in Venice
[02:09:57.560 --> 02:10:02.560]  you've got secession in Scotland you've got Texas secession from Mexico
[02:10:02.560 --> 02:10:07.560]  the colonies secession from England you've got south Sudan
[02:10:07.560 --> 02:10:12.560]  but the west the powers that be supported if they're having somebody to
[02:10:12.560 --> 02:10:17.560]  proceed to their power block but then Crimea that's always been part of
[02:10:17.560 --> 02:10:21.560]  Russia and most cases in history originally part of Russia they secede
[02:10:21.560 --> 02:10:25.560]  NATO and the EU grabbed 90% of the country and they spin it around like
[02:10:25.560 --> 02:10:30.560]  Russia is starting something here and they're starting a new Cold War
[02:10:30.560 --> 02:10:33.560]  the truth is corporate interests run the EU and we've talked a lot about that
[02:10:33.560 --> 02:10:37.560]  and they want to be able to take over Eastern Europe for their own corporate
[02:10:37.560 --> 02:10:41.560]  Soviet Union I'd call it I mean look what they're doing in Greece and
[02:10:41.560 --> 02:10:44.560]  in all these other countries appointing the presidents in Italy
[02:10:44.560 --> 02:10:47.560]  I mean this is the technocratic takeover in their own words
[02:10:47.560 --> 02:10:51.560]  but I thought it was important to actually get a constitutional professor on
[02:10:51.560 --> 02:10:55.560]  and I mean I've seen a bunch of constitutional professors on the left right
[02:10:55.560 --> 02:10:59.560]  the center they're all saying of course this is a legitimate secession
[02:10:59.560 --> 02:11:03.560]  but I wanted to talk about Ukraine and then expanded into larger issues
[02:11:03.560 --> 02:11:07.560]  of secession they claim Texas because it opted in by treaty is the only
[02:11:07.560 --> 02:11:11.560]  state that could without even getting the government the federal government to allow it
[02:11:11.560 --> 02:11:15.560]  could leave the union but the way I read the Constitution Bill of Rights I believe
[02:11:15.560 --> 02:11:19.560]  any of the states could succeed if they wanted to doesn't mean I'm calling for secession
[02:11:19.560 --> 02:11:24.560]  but this is a way people self-determine so Robert Blecker an expert on secession
[02:11:24.560 --> 02:11:30.560]  joins us and Bloomberg also picked up some of the some of his reports
[02:11:30.560 --> 02:11:33.560]  getting into that American constitutional history professor
[02:11:33.560 --> 02:11:38.560]  Crimean secession from Ukraine is valid and we've got an article up on infowars.com
[02:11:38.560 --> 02:11:41.560]  dealing with that from George Washington's blog
[02:11:41.560 --> 02:11:46.560]  so professor thanks for coming on where should we tackle this first
[02:11:46.560 --> 02:11:48.560]  thanks for having me Alex
[02:11:48.560 --> 02:11:52.560]  I think we oddly I think we should tackle this from a perspective of punishment
[02:11:52.560 --> 02:11:56.560]  because I think part of what's driving American foreign policy right now towards Russia
[02:11:56.560 --> 02:12:01.560]  is this feeling that we need to punish Russia we need to punish Putin
[02:12:01.560 --> 02:12:05.560]  and then the question becomes why do we need to punish Russia and why do we need to punish Putin
[02:12:05.560 --> 02:12:08.560]  well standardly I mean if you look at the justifications for punishment
[02:12:08.560 --> 02:12:13.560]  one of them and perhaps the only valid one here if there is one is deterrence
[02:12:13.560 --> 02:12:19.560]  that we sense that this is just the opening move in a gambit that he means to play in a wider field
[02:12:19.560 --> 02:12:23.560]  and that he starts with Crimea then he moves to Eastern Ukraine
[02:12:23.560 --> 02:12:26.560]  and then he moves on and on toward Europe
[02:12:26.560 --> 02:12:30.560]  and I understand that argument and none of us are naive and none of us forget Hitler
[02:12:30.560 --> 02:12:34.560]  I'm not saying Putin is Hitler and I take none of us really trust him
[02:12:34.560 --> 02:12:38.560]  I heard your segment with Ron Paul and he correctly said he's no angel
[02:12:38.560 --> 02:12:45.560]  but let's put deterrence to the side and let's look at the other principle justification for punishment
[02:12:45.560 --> 02:12:50.560]  which is what I think is really motivating the American public to support these sanctions against Russia
[02:12:50.560 --> 02:12:54.560]  and that is that somehow they cheated at the Constitution game
[02:12:54.560 --> 02:12:59.560]  that they've put themselves in opposition of fundamental American constitutional values
[02:12:59.560 --> 02:13:02.560]  and that therefore they deserve to be punished
[02:13:02.560 --> 02:13:06.560]  and if you look at American constitutional history nothing could be further from the truth
[02:13:06.560 --> 02:13:10.560]  I mean you mentioned some of it but you left out one big piece of it
[02:13:10.560 --> 02:13:14.560]  not only did the colonies secede from the British Empire
[02:13:14.560 --> 02:13:20.560]  and not only did they justify that secession in the Declaration of Independence in 1776
[02:13:20.560 --> 02:13:25.560]  in which they said that the only legitimate basis for government is the full consent
[02:13:25.560 --> 02:13:31.560]  and the real consent of the people which whenever withdrawn delegitimizes that government
[02:13:31.560 --> 02:13:38.560]  but the thing that's widely overlooked is we fought the American Revolution under the Articles of Confederation
[02:13:38.560 --> 02:13:40.560]  which was our first Constitution
[02:13:40.560 --> 02:13:46.560]  and the Articles of Confederation said of itself that it was to be a perpetual union
[02:13:46.560 --> 02:13:51.560]  and that it was only to be amended on the unanimous agreement of the states
[02:13:51.560 --> 02:13:56.560]  and then we had the Philadelphia Convention because it depends upon your view of what motivated that convention
[02:13:56.560 --> 02:14:00.560]  it could be economic interest and self-interest and power grabs
[02:14:00.560 --> 02:14:04.560]  or it could be a legitimate problem with the Articles but whichever it is
[02:14:04.560 --> 02:14:09.560]  the fact is that out of Philadelphia we reported a document that would go into effect
[02:14:09.560 --> 02:14:12.560]  when nine states only agreed to it
[02:14:12.560 --> 02:14:17.560]  this is in direct contravention to the Constitution under which we were operating
[02:14:17.560 --> 02:14:22.560]  it said A, no changes without unanimous agreement of the states
[02:14:22.560 --> 02:14:26.560]  and B, that said of itself that it was to be a perpetual union
[02:14:26.560 --> 02:14:32.560]  so when we ratified the Constitution or rather when nine states ratified the Constitution
[02:14:32.560 --> 02:14:34.560]  what were they doing?
[02:14:34.560 --> 02:14:37.560]  they were seceding from the United States of America
[02:14:37.560 --> 02:14:40.560]  and when the tenth state ratified the Constitution
[02:14:40.560 --> 02:14:42.560]  it was not only seceding
[02:14:42.560 --> 02:14:46.560]  but it was essentially being annexed by the other nine
[02:14:46.560 --> 02:14:49.560]  simultaneously with its secession
[02:14:49.560 --> 02:14:53.560]  now no more than 11 states ever appeared in Philadelphia at the same time
[02:14:53.560 --> 02:14:56.560]  and we may forget but if we look back to our history
[02:14:56.560 --> 02:15:01.560]  we'll see that all 13 states did not ratify the Constitution immediately
[02:15:01.560 --> 02:15:04.560]  Rhode Island never sent representatives and refused to ratify
[02:15:04.560 --> 02:15:07.560]  North Carolina initially refused to ratify
[02:15:07.560 --> 02:15:11.560]  so at one point we had a union of 11 states
[02:15:11.560 --> 02:15:14.560]  and the other two could properly say to the 11
[02:15:14.560 --> 02:15:16.560]  you've seceded from the union
[02:15:16.560 --> 02:15:19.560]  and then I can go on and presumably we will in our conversation
[02:15:19.560 --> 02:15:24.560]  but we tend to associate secession with the south and with slavery
[02:15:24.560 --> 02:15:26.560]  and nothing could be further from the truth
[02:15:26.560 --> 02:15:29.560]  there was the northern leaders that were pushing secession immediately
[02:15:29.560 --> 02:15:35.560]  at first when the Louisiana Purchase presented us the opportunity of having new states made it from that
[02:15:35.560 --> 02:15:37.560]  northern leaders threatened to secede
[02:15:37.560 --> 02:15:41.560]  and then in the unpopular war up north, the war of 1812 with England
[02:15:41.560 --> 02:15:45.560]  the new England states met in Hartford Connecticut
[02:15:45.560 --> 02:15:48.560]  with a Hartford Convention with a threat of secession
[02:15:48.560 --> 02:15:50.560]  and then later in Texas joined the union
[02:15:50.560 --> 02:15:52.560]  again there was a northern threat of secession
[02:15:52.560 --> 02:15:56.560]  but the point is not whether the secession was right or wrong
[02:15:56.560 --> 02:16:01.560]  but the fact was it was unquestionably part of the constitutional conversation
[02:16:01.560 --> 02:16:06.560]  and it has been traditionally part of fundamental American constitutional values
[02:16:06.560 --> 02:16:09.560]  so if we look to punish Russia because somehow they deserve it
[02:16:09.560 --> 02:16:15.560]  because they've engaged in this anti-American, anti-constitutional move
[02:16:15.560 --> 02:16:21.560]  by seceding or by impelling Crimea to secede, we're wrong
[02:16:21.560 --> 02:16:25.560]  now we can get into it, there are problems with the referendum that Russia held
[02:16:25.560 --> 02:16:27.560]  or that in theory Crimea held
[02:16:27.560 --> 02:16:31.560]  and problems in terms of it conflicting with basic American values
[02:16:31.560 --> 02:16:34.560]  but not secession itself
[02:16:34.560 --> 02:16:37.560]  very well said professor and expanding on this
[02:16:37.560 --> 02:16:41.560]  I'm just a layman but I have read the Federalist Papers, the Anti-Federalist Papers
[02:16:41.560 --> 02:16:44.560]  I've studied world history in a wide swath
[02:16:44.560 --> 02:16:48.560]  and this is a self-determination that we see over and over again
[02:16:48.560 --> 02:16:50.560]  and have carried out by the majority of the people
[02:16:50.560 --> 02:16:53.560]  has always been seen as legitimate
[02:16:53.560 --> 02:16:56.560]  as really a veto over larger political units
[02:16:56.560 --> 02:16:59.560]  but just from a layman's term a few years ago
[02:16:59.560 --> 02:17:02.560]  I called for a new Declaration of Independence
[02:17:02.560 --> 02:17:04.560]  not to get rid of the old republic
[02:17:04.560 --> 02:17:07.560]  as the Declaration of Independence says we can make new forms
[02:17:07.560 --> 02:17:10.560]  to secure our liberties, it's our right and our duty
[02:17:10.560 --> 02:17:13.560]  if we have special interest in others in the districts of criminals
[02:17:13.560 --> 02:17:18.560]  that have taken over and are in their own revolutions
[02:17:18.560 --> 02:17:22.560]  seceding from America and bringing in a tyranny over us
[02:17:22.560 --> 02:17:26.560]  then what about the states convening to then announce
[02:17:26.560 --> 02:17:30.560]  that we're abolishing the bureaucracy
[02:17:30.560 --> 02:17:33.560]  or abolishing sections of the federal government
[02:17:33.560 --> 02:17:36.560]  or abolishing the whole thing, whatever gets voted on
[02:17:36.560 --> 02:17:39.560]  to then re-upload the old republic
[02:17:39.560 --> 02:17:43.560]  in a kind of secession as a way to point out
[02:17:43.560 --> 02:17:45.560]  that we've had our federal government hijacked
[02:17:45.560 --> 02:17:47.560]  I had a bunch of constitutional lawyers on
[02:17:47.560 --> 02:17:50.560]  like Evan Vieira and others and they agreed with me
[02:17:50.560 --> 02:17:53.560]  and Ron Paul agreed but they quantified it more in legalese
[02:17:53.560 --> 02:17:56.560]  it just seems like people say secede
[02:17:56.560 --> 02:17:59.560]  well couldn't we secede to restore the republic
[02:17:59.560 --> 02:18:01.560]  because clearly this isn't the republic
[02:18:01.560 --> 02:18:03.560]  we've got operating right now
[02:18:03.560 --> 02:18:06.560]  well we don't need to secede
[02:18:06.560 --> 02:18:10.560]  there are two processes for amending the United States Constitution
[02:18:10.560 --> 02:18:13.560]  one is the one that we've always engaged in
[02:18:13.560 --> 02:18:16.560]  which is to have two-thirds of each branch of Congress
[02:18:16.560 --> 02:18:18.560]  approve the amendment then submit it to the states
[02:18:18.560 --> 02:18:20.560]  and have it approved by majorities
[02:18:20.560 --> 02:18:22.560]  and three-fourths of the state legislatures
[02:18:22.560 --> 02:18:25.560]  but the Constitution provides for another way of amending itself
[02:18:25.560 --> 02:18:28.560]  which can circumvent Congress itself
[02:18:28.560 --> 02:18:31.560]  and that is a two-thirds of the states call for
[02:18:31.560 --> 02:18:33.560]  a new constitutional convention
[02:18:33.560 --> 02:18:35.560]  then it can propose amendments
[02:18:35.560 --> 02:18:37.560]  which again would be ratified by majorities
[02:18:37.560 --> 02:18:39.560]  and three-fourths of the states
[02:18:39.560 --> 02:18:41.560]  so that you can circumvent the national government
[02:18:41.560 --> 02:18:43.560]  and still amend the United States Constitution
[02:18:43.560 --> 02:18:46.560]  we've not done it before but we can do it
[02:18:46.560 --> 02:18:48.560]  so we don't need secession in that respect
[02:18:48.560 --> 02:18:51.560]  now I understand I get so scared of a concon
[02:18:51.560 --> 02:18:53.560]  but I guess an overall secession movement
[02:18:53.560 --> 02:18:56.560]  and a new federation would be just as dangerous
[02:18:56.560 --> 02:18:58.560]  and I've always been against a concon
[02:18:58.560 --> 02:19:01.560]  but I guess we get to the point of we're in so much trouble
[02:19:01.560 --> 02:19:06.560]  do you think our republic is off the rails
[02:19:06.560 --> 02:19:08.560]  or what's your view on that?
[02:19:08.560 --> 02:19:10.560]  Well you and I may not have the identical politics here
[02:19:10.560 --> 02:19:13.560]  although we probably have the identical view of history
[02:19:13.560 --> 02:19:18.560]  I'm appalled at federal overreach as I know you are
[02:19:18.560 --> 02:19:22.560]  there are areas with which I fundamentally disagree
[02:19:22.560 --> 02:19:25.560]  with Ron Paul in terms of the legitimate role of defense
[02:19:25.560 --> 02:19:28.560]  and the importance of it and the requirement
[02:19:28.560 --> 02:19:30.560]  for us to remain a free people
[02:19:30.560 --> 02:19:33.560]  to be a strong people in order to be a free people
[02:19:33.560 --> 02:19:35.560]  and that strength must reach outside of our borders
[02:19:35.560 --> 02:19:38.560]  so we may not have identical views on that
[02:19:38.560 --> 02:19:40.560]  No I understand but we come back then professor
[02:19:40.560 --> 02:19:43.560]  explain to me your view on then as a constitutional lawyer
[02:19:43.560 --> 02:19:45.560]  and a guy that's worked in the federal government as well
[02:19:45.560 --> 02:19:48.560]  where we're at historically compared to Rome say
[02:19:48.560 --> 02:19:52.560]  I mean it's similar but not close when it comes to the modern technology
[02:19:52.560 --> 02:19:54.560]  we'll be right back with our guest

[02:24:28.560 --> 02:24:30.560]  and I know I beg the question
[02:24:30.560 --> 02:24:32.560]  because then we're talking about secession
[02:24:32.560 --> 02:24:34.560]  but briefly where do you stand
[02:24:34.560 --> 02:24:37.560]  on that quandary with the death penalty
[02:24:37.560 --> 02:24:39.560]  well I've spent thousands of hours
[02:24:39.560 --> 02:24:41.560]  inside maximum security prisons
[02:24:41.560 --> 02:24:43.560]  and on death rows in seven states
[02:24:43.560 --> 02:24:46.560]  interviewing the killers and the officers
[02:24:46.560 --> 02:24:48.560]  who house them and interact with them
[02:24:48.560 --> 02:24:50.560]  and have fairly extensively studied the system
[02:24:50.560 --> 02:24:52.560]  there's no doubt that it's flawed
[02:24:52.560 --> 02:24:54.560]  and there's no doubt that it can and should be improved
[02:24:54.560 --> 02:24:57.560]  I mean the book that's my crime and punishment memoir
[02:24:57.560 --> 02:24:58.560]  that's just been published
[02:24:58.560 --> 02:25:00.560]  the death of punishment goes into various improvements
[02:25:00.560 --> 02:25:02.560]  we can make and various problems with the system
[02:25:02.560 --> 02:25:06.560]  but overall for the worst of the worst of the worst
[02:25:06.560 --> 02:25:08.560]  for those for example who rape and torture children
[02:25:08.560 --> 02:25:11.560]  for the serial killers, for the hired killers
[02:25:11.560 --> 02:25:13.560]  when we can identify them
[02:25:13.560 --> 02:25:17.560]  when we are persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt
[02:25:17.560 --> 02:25:19.560]  with no residual doubt that they did it
[02:25:19.560 --> 02:25:22.560]  and to a moral certainty that they deserve it
[02:25:22.560 --> 02:25:25.560]  then it seems to me we have the moral obligation
[02:25:25.560 --> 02:25:26.560]  to execute them
[02:25:26.560 --> 02:25:28.560]  we'll have a discussion about that
[02:25:28.560 --> 02:25:30.560]  because I agree with you at a fundamental level
[02:25:30.560 --> 02:25:33.560]  it's just that again I don't support North Korea's death penalty
[02:25:33.560 --> 02:25:35.560]  because the government is the criminal institution
[02:25:35.560 --> 02:25:37.560]  so we begin to drift towards that area
[02:25:37.560 --> 02:25:39.560]  of you know I support the death penalty
[02:25:39.560 --> 02:25:41.560]  I wouldn't support it under Adolf Hitler
[02:25:41.560 --> 02:25:43.560]  well of course that's very interesting
[02:25:43.560 --> 02:25:45.560]  it's the same kind of argument in the slippery slope
[02:25:45.560 --> 02:25:47.560]  which can take us back to what you were saying earlier
[02:25:47.560 --> 02:25:48.560]  that I wanted to comment on
[02:25:48.560 --> 02:25:50.560]  in terms of self-determination
[02:25:50.560 --> 02:25:53.560]  it's been a problem since the very founding of the republic
[02:25:53.560 --> 02:25:54.560]  how far do you take it?
[02:25:54.560 --> 02:25:57.560]  so if we establish and I fully believe
[02:25:57.560 --> 02:25:59.560]  and I think history establishes a beyond any doubt
[02:25:59.560 --> 02:26:01.560]  American constitutional history
[02:26:01.560 --> 02:26:04.560]  that the constitution was a compact among the states
[02:26:04.560 --> 02:26:06.560]  where the states are understood not in the states
[02:26:06.560 --> 02:26:08.560]  as governments, as legislatures
[02:26:08.560 --> 02:26:10.560]  but as the people residing in them
[02:26:10.560 --> 02:26:13.560]  that each state compacted to be part of the union
[02:26:13.560 --> 02:26:15.560]  acceded to the union
[02:26:15.560 --> 02:26:18.560]  and therefore each state may secede from the union
[02:26:18.560 --> 02:26:21.560]  the states may, they're the mommy and the daddy
[02:26:21.560 --> 02:26:22.560]  they made it
[02:26:22.560 --> 02:26:23.560]  that's correct
[02:26:23.560 --> 02:26:24.560]  now the question comes
[02:26:24.560 --> 02:26:26.560]  how far do you take that
[02:26:26.560 --> 02:26:29.560]  may a county secede from a state
[02:26:29.560 --> 02:26:32.560]  may a town secede from a county
[02:26:32.560 --> 02:26:35.560]  may a village secede from a town
[02:26:35.560 --> 02:26:37.560]  may a neighborhood secede from a village
[02:26:37.560 --> 02:26:39.560]  may a block secede from a neighborhood
[02:26:39.560 --> 02:26:41.560]  may an individual secede from all of it
[02:26:41.560 --> 02:26:43.560]  it's the challenge of the slippery slope
[02:26:43.560 --> 02:26:46.560]  is there something sacred, constitutionally sacred
[02:26:46.560 --> 02:26:49.560]  about the people of each individual state
[02:26:49.560 --> 02:26:51.560]  in their highest sovereign capacity
[02:26:51.560 --> 02:26:54.560]  that does not get replicated as you get to more and more
[02:26:54.560 --> 02:26:55.560]  particular levels
[02:26:55.560 --> 02:26:58.560]  because if not then of course we're left with the
[02:26:58.560 --> 02:27:00.560]  with a notion of the social contract
[02:27:00.560 --> 02:27:03.560]  in which each individual is allowed to contract
[02:27:03.560 --> 02:27:05.560]  in or contract out
[02:27:05.560 --> 02:27:07.560]  anytime that he or she sees fit
[02:27:07.560 --> 02:27:09.560]  which case we lose the distinction
[02:27:09.560 --> 02:27:11.560]  between a law abiding citizen and a criminal
[02:27:11.560 --> 02:27:14.560]  well bottom line looking at this
[02:27:14.560 --> 02:27:16.560]  from my research
[02:27:16.560 --> 02:27:19.560]  the Crimean annexation is pretty clean
[02:27:19.560 --> 02:27:22.560]  and legitimate 97% plus
[02:27:22.560 --> 02:27:24.560]  voted to do it
[02:27:24.560 --> 02:27:27.560]  I mean I just it looks asinine from my view
[02:27:27.560 --> 02:27:29.560]  to have the so-called U.S. government
[02:27:29.560 --> 02:27:31.560]  a.k.a. Obama administration
[02:27:31.560 --> 02:27:33.560]  that helps start this whole thing
[02:27:33.560 --> 02:27:35.560]  with the State Department there
[02:27:35.560 --> 02:27:38.560]  act like Russia is involved in some hitlerian expansion
[02:27:38.560 --> 02:27:40.560]  that's true
[02:27:40.560 --> 02:27:42.560]  however something should be said
[02:27:42.560 --> 02:27:44.560]  in terms of American constitutional values
[02:27:44.560 --> 02:27:46.560]  there were there were two respects
[02:27:46.560 --> 02:27:49.560]  in which that referendum
[02:27:49.560 --> 02:27:51.560]  fell critically short by our values
[02:27:51.560 --> 02:27:53.560]  and we should acknowledge it
[02:27:53.560 --> 02:27:56.560]  number one is that they it was not the product
[02:27:56.560 --> 02:27:58.560]  of a free and full deliberation
[02:27:58.560 --> 02:28:00.560]  now Putin was smart enough
[02:28:00.560 --> 02:28:02.560]  not to make it a legislative act
[02:28:02.560 --> 02:28:03.560]  on the part of Crimea
[02:28:03.560 --> 02:28:05.560]  because one thing American constitutional
[02:28:05.560 --> 02:28:07.560]  values stand for clearly
[02:28:07.560 --> 02:28:10.560]  is that secession cannot be a legislative act
[02:28:10.560 --> 02:28:12.560]  because if the legislature secedes
[02:28:12.560 --> 02:28:13.560]  or accedes to it
[02:28:13.560 --> 02:28:15.560]  but it was a snap vote
[02:28:15.560 --> 02:28:17.560]  that's part of it that's right
[02:28:17.560 --> 02:28:19.560]  it was not done after full and fair deliberation
[02:28:19.560 --> 02:28:22.560]  a. and b. it was done where dissent was silenced
[02:28:22.560 --> 02:28:24.560]  and it was done where the military
[02:28:24.560 --> 02:28:26.560]  Russian military was occupying it
[02:28:26.560 --> 02:28:28.560]  so it fails in those two respects
[02:28:28.560 --> 02:28:30.560]  now if we look back at our own constitutional
[02:28:30.560 --> 02:28:33.560]  ratification process we also were far from perfect
[02:28:33.560 --> 02:28:35.560]  if a full free vote were taken
[02:28:35.560 --> 02:28:37.560]  for example the people of Massachusetts
[02:28:37.560 --> 02:28:39.560]  Massachusetts would have rejected the constitution
[02:28:39.560 --> 02:28:41.560]  in 1788 as would New York have
[02:28:41.560 --> 02:28:43.560]  as would Virginia have
[02:28:43.560 --> 02:28:45.560]  in part we manipulated it
[02:28:45.560 --> 02:28:47.560]  but the people in power
[02:28:47.560 --> 02:28:49.560]  with wealth in the cities
[02:28:49.560 --> 02:28:52.560]  however by by by our standards
[02:28:52.560 --> 02:28:54.560]  the Russian secession
[02:28:54.560 --> 02:28:56.560]  the Russian annexation falls far short
[02:28:56.560 --> 02:28:58.560]  the Crimean secession falls far short
[02:28:58.560 --> 02:29:00.560]  it was exactly what you said
[02:29:00.560 --> 02:29:02.560]  it was a snap decision
[02:29:02.560 --> 02:29:04.560]  97% is not accurate
[02:29:04.560 --> 02:29:06.560]  that's what the Paul said
[02:29:06.560 --> 02:29:08.560]  but 97% does not reflect the will of the Crimean people
[02:29:08.560 --> 02:29:10.560]  however both you and I believe
[02:29:10.560 --> 02:29:12.560]  and I'm quite confident that we're correct
[02:29:12.560 --> 02:29:15.560]  that if it were put to a full fair vote
[02:29:15.560 --> 02:29:17.560]  after serious deliberation
[02:29:17.560 --> 02:29:20.560]  the overwhelming majority of the Crimean people
[02:29:20.560 --> 02:29:22.560]  would choose to secede from Ukraine
[02:29:22.560 --> 02:29:24.560]  and rejoin Russia
[02:29:24.560 --> 02:29:26.560]  plus professor if you look at the fact that
[02:29:26.560 --> 02:29:28.560]  the NATO back group
[02:29:28.560 --> 02:29:30.560]  overthrew the rest of the thing
[02:29:30.560 --> 02:29:32.560]  that's so illegitimate that the two
[02:29:32.560 --> 02:29:34.560]  I think cancel each other out
[02:29:34.560 --> 02:29:36.560]  what's your view on that
[02:29:36.560 --> 02:29:38.560]  well um
[02:29:38.560 --> 02:29:40.560]  yes I think that's largely true
[02:29:40.560 --> 02:29:42.560]  come back and do two more minutes to finish the thought
[02:29:42.560 --> 02:29:44.560]  and then we'll let the professor go and get into the other news
[02:29:44.560 --> 02:29:46.560]  stay with us, I want to finish that thought professor

[02:30:59.560 --> 02:31:01.560]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk
[02:31:01.560 --> 02:31:03.560]  and his team of patriots over at MyPatriot Supply
[02:31:03.560 --> 02:31:05.560]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two bedroom apartment
[02:31:05.560 --> 02:31:07.560]  Frustrated with the direction this country was headed
[02:31:07.560 --> 02:31:09.560]  and the Charlottes willing to sell us out for a quick buck
[02:31:09.560 --> 02:31:11.560]  Deciding to take action
[02:31:11.560 --> 02:31:13.560]  A company run by patriots for patriots was born
[02:31:13.560 --> 02:31:15.560]  MyPatriots was born
[02:31:15.560 --> 02:31:17.560]  MyPatriots was born

[02:31:27.560 --> 02:31:29.560]  and employ over 50

[02:34:03.560 --> 02:34:04.560]  I want to get him on about that
[02:34:04.560 --> 02:34:06.560]  just talk about the kind of folks that are in these supermaxes
[02:34:06.560 --> 02:34:08.560]  I've seen some documentaries
[02:34:08.560 --> 02:34:12.560]  and man you talk about just savage whacked out murderers
[02:34:12.560 --> 02:34:15.560]  a lot of them I think are just completely mentally ill
[02:34:15.560 --> 02:34:18.560]  the same time you would put a rabid pit bull to sleep
[02:34:18.560 --> 02:34:20.560]  that attacks people anytime it gets around them
[02:34:20.560 --> 02:34:23.560]  I see the whole point when everybody knows
[02:34:23.560 --> 02:34:25.560]  that they're a murderer
[02:34:25.560 --> 02:34:27.560]  but we'll have that discussion another time
[02:34:27.560 --> 02:34:28.560]  I'm already going back over
[02:34:28.560 --> 02:34:29.560]  old ground
[02:34:29.560 --> 02:34:31.560]  finishing up with the issue of
[02:34:31.560 --> 02:34:34.560]  how the West and NATO and the EU
[02:34:34.560 --> 02:34:36.560]  came in, spent five billion
[02:34:36.560 --> 02:34:37.560]  the State Department admits
[02:34:37.560 --> 02:34:39.560]  basically overthrew the elected government
[02:34:39.560 --> 02:34:41.560]  who nobody's seeing were angels
[02:34:41.560 --> 02:34:44.560]  but overthrew it took most of the country
[02:34:44.560 --> 02:34:47.560]  to put in actual neo-Nazis
[02:34:47.560 --> 02:34:49.560]  that marched around Highling Hitler
[02:34:49.560 --> 02:34:51.560]  this is like a Twilight Zone episode
[02:34:51.560 --> 02:34:53.560]  so just to pose American values
[02:34:53.560 --> 02:34:56.560]  how does Obama and the State Department
[02:34:56.560 --> 02:34:59.560]  get away with lionizing the Ukrainian leadership
[02:34:59.560 --> 02:35:01.560]  because I know there's a lot of good Ukrainians
[02:35:01.560 --> 02:35:02.560]  don't like the government was there
[02:35:02.560 --> 02:35:04.560]  and don't like the Russian influence
[02:35:04.560 --> 02:35:06.560]  I get that but this is so over the top
[02:35:06.560 --> 02:35:08.560]  from researching the players
[02:35:08.560 --> 02:35:11.560]  I'm pinching myself professor
[02:35:11.560 --> 02:35:14.560]  here's what I would do, I mean if I were Obama
[02:35:14.560 --> 02:35:16.560]  what I would do is
[02:35:16.560 --> 02:35:19.560]  and probably through the Secretary of State
[02:35:19.560 --> 02:35:21.560]  or if I had direct conversations with Putin
[02:35:21.560 --> 02:35:22.560]  as he apparently is having
[02:35:22.560 --> 02:35:24.560]  I would say look
[02:35:24.560 --> 02:35:27.560]  insofar as our constitutional values are at stake
[02:35:27.560 --> 02:35:30.560]  here's really what we demand
[02:35:30.560 --> 02:35:34.560]  Crimea should have a full and fair discussion
[02:35:34.560 --> 02:35:36.560]  Crimea should have a convention
[02:35:36.560 --> 02:35:38.560]  that represents the people of Crimea
[02:35:38.560 --> 02:35:40.560]  and then put it to a vote
[02:35:40.560 --> 02:35:41.560]  and you're probably gonna win it
[02:35:41.560 --> 02:35:43.560]  now the next move is gonna be about
[02:35:43.560 --> 02:35:45.560]  Eastern Ukraine and Western Ukraine
[02:35:45.560 --> 02:35:46.560]  and whether they can split
[02:35:46.560 --> 02:35:47.560]  because I have very little doubt
[02:35:47.560 --> 02:35:49.560]  that Putin and Russia has its eyes
[02:35:49.560 --> 02:35:51.560]  on Eastern Ukraine
[02:35:51.560 --> 02:35:53.560]  and see whether it can join Russia
[02:35:53.560 --> 02:35:54.560]  whether they want to
[02:35:54.560 --> 02:35:56.560]  and there the question is whether the Ukrainian people
[02:35:56.560 --> 02:35:59.560]  really are legitimately a coherent people
[02:35:59.560 --> 02:36:01.560]  or whether they conceive of themselves
[02:36:01.560 --> 02:36:03.560]  as distinct societies
[02:36:03.560 --> 02:36:05.560]  and the troubling question is
[02:36:05.560 --> 02:36:09.560]  if you put that to a full and fair discussion
[02:36:09.560 --> 02:36:11.560]  through elected representatives through the West
[02:36:11.560 --> 02:36:13.560]  and the Eastern Ukraine
[02:36:13.560 --> 02:36:15.560]  would A. the people of Ukraine
[02:36:15.560 --> 02:36:18.560]  considered as one people vote to split apart
[02:36:18.560 --> 02:36:20.560]  remember Czechoslovakia
[02:36:20.560 --> 02:36:23.560]  split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia
[02:36:23.560 --> 02:36:26.560]  and nobody's quarreling with that legitimate split
[02:36:26.560 --> 02:36:27.560]  into two republics
[02:36:27.560 --> 02:36:29.560]  so the deep issue is really gonna be
[02:36:29.560 --> 02:36:30.560]  the deep constitutional issue
[02:36:30.560 --> 02:36:32.560]  that implicates our values is
[02:36:32.560 --> 02:36:35.560]  will we all put it to a full and fair vote
[02:36:35.560 --> 02:36:38.560]  and will we allow Eastern Ukraine
[02:36:38.560 --> 02:36:40.560]  to separately vote from Western Ukraine
[02:36:40.560 --> 02:36:42.560]  as to whether they separate
[02:36:42.560 --> 02:36:44.560]  and if Western Ukraine says we want one nation
[02:36:44.560 --> 02:36:46.560]  and Eastern Ukraine says we want to join Russia
[02:36:46.560 --> 02:36:47.560]  then what do you do
[02:36:47.560 --> 02:36:49.560]  and so what it may all boil down to
[02:36:49.560 --> 02:36:51.560]  is what Thucydides brilliantly described
[02:36:51.560 --> 02:36:54.560]  in the million debates in the Peloponnesian Wars
[02:36:54.560 --> 02:36:57.560]  27 centuries ago when the poor little island of Melos
[02:36:57.560 --> 02:36:59.560]  just asked to remain independent
[02:36:59.560 --> 02:37:02.560]  and be kept out of the war between Athens and Sparta
[02:37:02.560 --> 02:37:04.560]  and Athens gave them two choices
[02:37:04.560 --> 02:37:06.560]  which was either submit or die
[02:37:06.560 --> 02:37:08.560]  and the millions complained and said that was unjust
[02:37:08.560 --> 02:37:10.560]  and the Athenian representatives replied
[02:37:10.560 --> 02:37:14.560]  justice depends upon the equality of power
[02:37:14.560 --> 02:37:17.560]  to compel the strong do what they can
[02:37:17.560 --> 02:37:19.560]  the weak accept what they must
[02:37:19.560 --> 02:37:21.560]  and that's maybe what it all comes down to
[02:37:21.560 --> 02:37:24.560]  that's right political power goes out of a barrel of a gun
[02:37:24.560 --> 02:37:26.560]  yep
[02:37:26.560 --> 02:37:29.560]  and that's why the state wants the monopoly of force
[02:37:29.560 --> 02:37:32.560]  and that's why I obsess over guns all day
[02:37:32.560 --> 02:37:34.560]  is because of the canary in the coal mine
[02:37:34.560 --> 02:37:36.560]  also free speech is the canary in the coal mine
[02:37:36.560 --> 02:37:39.560]  and we're seeing more and more moves to block religious freedom
[02:37:39.560 --> 02:37:41.560]  all sorts of freedom in this country
[02:37:41.560 --> 02:37:43.560]  we're seeing moves in England to ban
[02:37:43.560 --> 02:37:45.560]  questioning manmade global warming
[02:37:45.560 --> 02:37:47.560]  I see the west professor last question
[02:37:47.560 --> 02:37:50.560]  do you see the west I certainly see it undoubtedly
[02:37:50.560 --> 02:37:52.560]  degenerating on many fronts
[02:37:52.560 --> 02:37:54.560]  into an authoritarianism
[02:37:54.560 --> 02:37:56.560]  and A do you agree with that and B
[02:37:56.560 --> 02:37:58.560]  can we reverse that
[02:37:58.560 --> 02:38:00.560]  B is yes
[02:38:00.560 --> 02:38:02.560]  we can reverse it
[02:38:02.560 --> 02:38:04.560]  I don't think it's
[02:38:04.560 --> 02:38:06.560]  I don't think it's uniformly degenerating
[02:38:06.560 --> 02:38:08.560]  I think there are pockets of real problems
[02:38:08.560 --> 02:38:10.560]  and authoritarian
[02:38:10.560 --> 02:38:12.560]  I mean I have a real problem for example with
[02:38:12.560 --> 02:38:14.560]  the federal overreach into the criminal justice system
[02:38:14.560 --> 02:38:17.560]  the essence of state sovereignty
[02:38:17.560 --> 02:38:20.560]  was from the very beginning the right to define, detect
[02:38:20.560 --> 02:38:22.560]  prosecute and punish crime
[02:38:22.560 --> 02:38:24.560]  as each state sees fit
[02:38:24.560 --> 02:38:26.560]  the federal government has used
[02:38:26.560 --> 02:38:28.560]  the limited federal criminal power
[02:38:28.560 --> 02:38:30.560]  and is just occupying the field
[02:38:30.560 --> 02:38:32.560]  and I assume we will have a follow up
[02:38:32.560 --> 02:38:34.560]  we talk about the Boston Marathon bomber
[02:38:34.560 --> 02:38:36.560]  who I would like to see executed
[02:38:36.560 --> 02:38:38.560]  nevertheless he really committed
[02:38:38.560 --> 02:38:40.560]  mass murder on the state level
[02:38:40.560 --> 02:38:42.560]  and if Massachusetts chooses not to have the death penalty
[02:38:42.560 --> 02:38:44.560]  well that's Massachusetts right
[02:38:44.560 --> 02:38:46.560]  so I'm deeply conflicted because on the one hand
[02:38:46.560 --> 02:38:48.560]  I want him killed
[02:38:48.560 --> 02:38:50.560]  on the other hand I don't quite see the constitutional
[02:38:50.560 --> 02:38:52.560]  right to do it so to directly answer your question
[02:38:52.560 --> 02:38:54.560]  I mean yes I think we have serious problems
[02:38:54.560 --> 02:38:56.560]  I think we've lost sight of the common good
[02:38:56.560 --> 02:38:58.560]  that is to say in 1788
[02:38:58.560 --> 02:39:00.560]  whatever their differences were
[02:39:00.560 --> 02:39:02.560]  and they were profound politically
[02:39:02.560 --> 02:39:04.560]  the federalist versus the anti-federalist
[02:39:04.560 --> 02:39:06.560]  they fundamentally embraced
[02:39:06.560 --> 02:39:08.560]  the notion of the common good
[02:39:08.560 --> 02:39:10.560]  and right now it seems to me that
[02:39:10.560 --> 02:39:12.560]  it's much more about private greed
[02:39:12.560 --> 02:39:14.560]  than it is about the common good
[02:39:14.560 --> 02:39:16.560]  too many people trying to grab for power
[02:39:16.560 --> 02:39:18.560]  too many people trying to feather their own nests
[02:39:18.560 --> 02:39:20.560]  so I do see that the system
[02:39:20.560 --> 02:39:22.560]  is becoming corrupted by selfishness
[02:39:22.560 --> 02:39:24.560]  I do not think it's irreversible
[02:39:24.560 --> 02:39:26.560]  I have deep faith in constitutional values
[02:39:26.560 --> 02:39:28.560]  and constitutional values
[02:39:28.560 --> 02:39:30.560]  and the last thing I would say is that
[02:39:30.560 --> 02:39:32.560]  even though I
[02:39:32.560 --> 02:39:34.560]  declared as in real politic
[02:39:34.560 --> 02:39:36.560]  as you do that power
[02:39:36.560 --> 02:39:38.560]  grows out of the barrel of a gun
[02:39:38.560 --> 02:39:40.560]  the fact is power is also restrained
[02:39:40.560 --> 02:39:42.560]  in certain
[02:39:42.560 --> 02:39:44.560]  key respects within the military
[02:39:44.560 --> 02:39:46.560]  within the police it's restrained
[02:39:46.560 --> 02:39:48.560]  by constitutionalism
[02:39:48.560 --> 02:39:50.560]  I agree and it's also restrained as you said
[02:39:50.560 --> 02:39:52.560]  by the establishment itself
[02:39:52.560 --> 02:39:54.560]  and elites that in many cases have gotten there
[02:39:54.560 --> 02:39:56.560]  by hard work to keep checks
[02:39:56.560 --> 02:39:58.560]  and balances to protect their progeny
[02:39:58.560 --> 02:40:00.560]  and it's very
[02:40:00.560 --> 02:40:02.560]  unwise even for a corrupt establishment
[02:40:02.560 --> 02:40:04.560]  to get rid of the checks and balances
[02:40:04.560 --> 02:40:06.560]  and it always ends up biting them
[02:40:06.560 --> 02:40:08.560]  in the butt if they do it so I challenge
[02:40:08.560 --> 02:40:10.560]  the establishment itself which is very diverse
[02:40:10.560 --> 02:40:12.560]  to really try to
[02:40:12.560 --> 02:40:14.560]  reverse this authoritarian move
[02:40:14.560 --> 02:40:16.560]  because they're not in control
[02:40:16.560 --> 02:40:18.560]  of this genie that they're releasing out of the bottle
[02:40:18.560 --> 02:40:20.560]  you know I forgot who it was
[02:40:20.560 --> 02:40:22.560]  who said it but if you really
[02:40:22.560 --> 02:40:24.560]  want to understand your own politics
[02:40:24.560 --> 02:40:26.560]  someone once said
[02:40:26.560 --> 02:40:28.560]  probe deeply and ask yourself
[02:40:28.560 --> 02:40:30.560]  if you had only two choices
[02:40:30.560 --> 02:40:32.560]  which was to live in an anarchy
[02:40:32.560 --> 02:40:34.560]  or to live under a tyranny
[02:40:34.560 --> 02:40:36.560]  which would you prefer
[02:40:36.560 --> 02:40:38.560]  and of course neither one of us
[02:40:38.560 --> 02:40:40.560]  and none of us want either a tyranny
[02:40:40.560 --> 02:40:42.560]  or an anarchy but
[02:40:42.560 --> 02:40:44.560]  for me and I'm sure for you
[02:40:44.560 --> 02:40:46.560]  if I had to have one or the other I'd prefer
[02:40:46.560 --> 02:40:48.560]  anarchy to tyranny
[02:40:48.560 --> 02:40:50.560]  and that's really ultimately what it comes down to
[02:40:50.560 --> 02:40:52.560]  are we fundamentally about
[02:40:52.560 --> 02:40:54.560]  liberty or are we fundamentally about power
[02:40:54.560 --> 02:40:56.560]  are we fundamentally about freedom
[02:40:56.560 --> 02:40:58.560]  or are we fundamentally about control
[02:40:58.560 --> 02:41:00.560]  you are fundamentally about freedom
[02:41:00.560 --> 02:41:02.560]  I am fundamentally about freedom
[02:41:02.560 --> 02:41:04.560]  we may have different visions and our politics
[02:41:04.560 --> 02:41:06.560]  are not by any means identical
[02:41:06.560 --> 02:41:08.560]  but ultimately what we have in common
[02:41:08.560 --> 02:41:10.560]  is that we prefer liberty
[02:41:10.560 --> 02:41:12.560]  to control
[02:41:12.560 --> 02:41:14.560]  absolutely alright professor look forward
[02:41:14.560 --> 02:41:16.560]  to having you back on as soon as you want to come back on
[02:41:16.560 --> 02:41:18.560]  in the next few weeks about the death penalty
[02:41:18.560 --> 02:41:20.560]  my pleasure thanks for having me
[02:41:20.560 --> 02:41:22.560]  thank you that was a good interview very informative
[02:41:22.560 --> 02:41:24.560]  and again I'm not going to get into debates
[02:41:24.560 --> 02:41:26.560]  about the Boston bombing and how the brother was
[02:41:26.560 --> 02:41:28.560]  funded by the CIA and stuff
[02:41:28.560 --> 02:41:30.560]  there's compelling evidence
[02:41:30.560 --> 02:41:32.560]  from the perspective that
[02:41:32.560 --> 02:41:34.560]  these guys were set up as pats
[02:41:34.560 --> 02:41:36.560]  he's bare minimum
[02:41:36.560 --> 02:41:38.560]  and then that's why he says there's compelling evidence
[02:41:38.560 --> 02:41:40.560]  he was involved I know that
[02:41:40.560 --> 02:41:42.560]  the survivor is saying he was set up
[02:41:42.560 --> 02:41:44.560]  and is pleading not guilty
[02:41:44.560 --> 02:41:46.560]  but that's a further debate and we'll bring that up next time
[02:41:46.560 --> 02:41:48.560]  and get into those issues
[02:41:48.560 --> 02:41:50.560]  we're going to have reporters at the
[02:41:50.560 --> 02:41:52.560]  second well the first anniversary
[02:41:52.560 --> 02:41:54.560]  but at the
[02:41:54.560 --> 02:41:56.560]  new Boston Marathon after last year
[02:41:56.560 --> 02:41:58.560]  we're going to be there this year
[02:41:58.560 --> 02:42:00.560]  covering that
[02:42:00.560 --> 02:42:02.560]  I want to give you my review of the film
[02:42:02.560 --> 02:42:04.560]  NOAA
[02:42:04.560 --> 02:42:06.560]  and then I want to open the phones up just for a little spectrum
[02:42:06.560 --> 02:42:08.560]  of calls
[02:42:08.560 --> 02:42:10.560]  from people
[02:42:10.560 --> 02:42:12.560]  at Fort Hood Fort Hood is a giant
[02:42:12.560 --> 02:42:14.560]  military base the biggest in the world arguably
[02:42:14.560 --> 02:42:16.560]  there's one Russian one they say maybe
[02:42:16.560 --> 02:42:18.560]  bigger it definitely has more personnel
[02:42:18.560 --> 02:42:20.560]  than any other military base in the world
[02:42:20.560 --> 02:42:22.560]  I know we have a ton of listeners at Fort Hood
[02:42:22.560 --> 02:42:24.560]  listening on the internet
[02:42:24.560 --> 02:42:26.560]  and also on AM radio show
[02:42:26.560 --> 02:42:28.560]  I'd like to open the phones up for people at Fort Hood
[02:42:28.560 --> 02:42:30.560]  I think this was a real shooting
[02:42:30.560 --> 02:42:32.560]  the guy was on drugs
[02:42:32.560 --> 02:42:34.560]  government prescribed drugs
[02:42:34.560 --> 02:42:36.560]  that caused this just like in almost every other case
[02:42:36.560 --> 02:42:38.560]  I say almost every other I can't think of cases
[02:42:38.560 --> 02:42:40.560]  I did research this morning
[02:42:40.560 --> 02:42:42.560]  and couldn't find them where people weren't on these drugs
[02:42:42.560 --> 02:42:44.560]  and so I wanted
[02:42:44.560 --> 02:42:46.560]  from folks at the Fort Hood military base
[02:42:46.560 --> 02:42:48.560]  and to get your take on it
[02:42:48.560 --> 02:42:50.560]  it's 800-259-9231
[02:42:50.560 --> 02:42:52.560]  800-259-9231
[02:42:52.560 --> 02:42:54.560]  800-259-9231
[02:42:54.560 --> 02:42:56.560]  800-259-9231
[02:42:56.560 --> 02:42:58.560]  and if you're scrambling to get a pin
[02:42:58.560 --> 02:43:00.560]  to write that down if you're at Fort Hood
[02:43:00.560 --> 02:43:02.560]  800-259-9231
[02:43:02.560 --> 02:43:04.560]  you know
[02:43:04.560 --> 02:43:06.560]  we did play a clip off the news
[02:43:06.560 --> 02:43:08.560]  somebody uploaded to YouTube of shelter in place
[02:43:08.560 --> 02:43:10.560]  do not leave your homes
[02:43:10.560 --> 02:43:12.560]  I was shooting people yesterday evening
[02:43:12.560 --> 02:43:14.560]  in front of a bunch of witnesses
[02:43:14.560 --> 02:43:16.560]  it looks pretty open and shut
[02:43:16.560 --> 02:43:18.560]  again they're not
[02:43:18.560 --> 02:43:20.560]  out of the gates trying to blame the Second Amendment and stuff
[02:43:20.560 --> 02:43:22.560]  so
[02:43:22.560 --> 02:43:24.560]  you know when it's scripted and staged because it's just all lined up
[02:43:24.560 --> 02:43:26.560]  and they're ready to go like Sandy Hook and Aurora
[02:43:26.560 --> 02:43:28.560]  and then the same players pop up
[02:43:28.560 --> 02:43:30.560]  the same actors
[02:43:30.560 --> 02:43:32.560]  the same garbage
[02:43:32.560 --> 02:43:34.560]  and it's just so over the top I don't know how to respond to it
[02:43:34.560 --> 02:43:36.560]  but maybe I'm wrong if you're at the base and disagree with me
[02:43:36.560 --> 02:43:38.560]  or you've got something you want to add
[02:43:38.560 --> 02:43:40.560]  I'd like to hear from you
[02:43:40.560 --> 02:43:42.560]  800-259-9231
[02:43:44.560 --> 02:43:46.560]  and guys I see the phone system is not on
[02:43:46.560 --> 02:43:48.560]  so
[02:43:48.560 --> 02:43:50.560]  okay great
[02:43:50.560 --> 02:43:52.560]  alright so reboot that
[02:43:52.560 --> 02:43:54.560]  system for me thank you
[02:43:54.560 --> 02:43:56.560]  alright there we go 800
[02:43:56.560 --> 02:43:58.560]  if you tried to call in the phone system was off
[02:43:58.560 --> 02:44:00.560]  800-259-9231
[02:44:00.560 --> 02:44:02.560]  we'll get you up and on the air
[02:44:02.560 --> 02:44:04.560]  okay
[02:44:04.560 --> 02:44:06.560]  maybe I should go do a special report on this
[02:44:06.560 --> 02:44:08.560]  this is such a big subject
[02:44:08.560 --> 02:44:10.560]  and then air it maybe
[02:44:10.560 --> 02:44:12.560]  Sunday
[02:44:12.560 --> 02:44:14.560]  that way
[02:44:14.560 --> 02:44:16.560]  I can really give you the quotes
[02:44:16.560 --> 02:44:18.560]  and really go over it properly
[02:44:18.560 --> 02:44:20.560]  because I said I'd covered it now
[02:44:20.560 --> 02:44:22.560]  and then it's such a big subject
[02:44:22.560 --> 02:44:24.560]  that let me just give you a little
[02:44:24.560 --> 02:44:26.560]  little hors d'oeuvre on this front
[02:44:26.560 --> 02:44:28.560]  I went and saw the movie Noah last night
[02:44:28.560 --> 02:44:30.560]  I thought it was very weird
[02:44:30.560 --> 02:44:32.560]  very interesting film
[02:44:32.560 --> 02:44:34.560]  I would probably see it again just to take notes
[02:44:34.560 --> 02:44:36.560]  I don't know if I liked it
[02:44:36.560 --> 02:44:38.560]  it was definitely thought provoking
[02:44:38.560 --> 02:44:40.560]  it overall to the general
[02:44:40.560 --> 02:44:42.560]  unwashed masters had an anti-human
[02:44:42.560 --> 02:44:44.560]  eugenics based
[02:44:44.560 --> 02:44:46.560]  environmental
[02:44:46.560 --> 02:44:48.560]  fascist bent
[02:44:48.560 --> 02:44:50.560]  that meeting is bad
[02:44:50.560 --> 02:44:52.560]  that
[02:44:52.560 --> 02:44:54.560]  you know humans are hurting the earth
[02:44:54.560 --> 02:44:56.560]  which from perspectives you can say that's true
[02:44:56.560 --> 02:44:58.560]  you can say there's too many people in some
[02:44:58.560 --> 02:45:00.560]  areas you can say humans are destructive
[02:45:00.560 --> 02:45:02.560]  that's all honest
[02:45:02.560 --> 02:45:04.560]  we do some bad things
[02:45:04.560 --> 02:45:06.560]  my dog can also you know urinate on the rug
[02:45:06.560 --> 02:45:08.560]  but I love him so there are
[02:45:08.560 --> 02:45:10.560]  problems but the idea that we're ugly
[02:45:10.560 --> 02:45:12.560]  we're bad we should all die
[02:45:12.560 --> 02:45:14.560]  that's the message
[02:45:14.560 --> 02:45:16.560]  sold in the Bible if you
[02:45:16.560 --> 02:45:18.560]  read in
[02:45:18.560 --> 02:45:20.560]  and I've got the Bible verses here
[02:45:20.560 --> 02:45:22.560]  if you read
[02:45:22.560 --> 02:45:24.560]  what it says in the first few books
[02:45:24.560 --> 02:45:26.560]  the Bible it was because
[02:45:26.560 --> 02:45:28.560]  genetically
[02:45:28.560 --> 02:45:30.560]  humans had
[02:45:30.560 --> 02:45:32.560]  had sex
[02:45:32.560 --> 02:45:34.560]  with the Nephilim
[02:45:34.560 --> 02:45:36.560]  and had been with the sons of
[02:45:36.560 --> 02:45:38.560]  men
[02:45:38.560 --> 02:45:40.560]  and their genetics
[02:45:40.560 --> 02:45:42.560]  was not
[02:45:42.560 --> 02:45:44.560]  pure Noah was the only one pure
[02:45:44.560 --> 02:45:46.560]  in their generations
[02:45:46.560 --> 02:45:48.560]  and the movie has space aliens
[02:45:48.560 --> 02:45:50.560]  basically fallen angels
[02:45:50.560 --> 02:45:52.560]  who've been punished by the creator
[02:45:52.560 --> 02:45:54.560]  into becoming earth spirits or fire spirits
[02:45:54.560 --> 02:45:56.560]  as very new aging in a cult
[02:45:56.560 --> 02:45:58.560]  and
[02:45:58.560 --> 02:46:00.560]  early fallen angels they helped man and gave man
[02:46:00.560 --> 02:46:02.560]  knowledge
[02:46:02.560 --> 02:46:04.560]  and man was like a spirit as well
[02:46:04.560 --> 02:46:06.560]  I mean I'm a spoiler alert here
[02:46:06.560 --> 02:46:08.560]  obviously
[02:46:08.560 --> 02:46:10.560]  and I don't think it's biblically accurate
[02:46:10.560 --> 02:46:12.560]  but it's a lot more
[02:46:12.560 --> 02:46:14.560]  accurate than what you get in some mainline
[02:46:14.560 --> 02:46:16.560]  Catholic church or Baptist church
[02:46:16.560 --> 02:46:18.560]  where people in the last 300 years
[02:46:18.560 --> 02:46:20.560]  just can't deal with what's in the Bible
[02:46:20.560 --> 02:46:22.560]  I mean in Ezekiel there's giant
[02:46:22.560 --> 02:46:24.560]  burning flying saucers with guys with crystal
[02:46:24.560 --> 02:46:26.560]  helmets walking off of them and stuff
[02:46:26.560 --> 02:46:28.560]  there's 14 foot
[02:46:28.560 --> 02:46:30.560]  sons of the angels
[02:46:30.560 --> 02:46:32.560]  having sex with women
[02:46:32.560 --> 02:46:34.560]  so God destroys all the humans on the earth
[02:46:36.560 --> 02:46:38.560]  and you could say
[02:46:38.560 --> 02:46:40.560]  well is this real, is this not real
[02:46:40.560 --> 02:46:42.560]  well the point is you can't sit there and say you believe the Bible
[02:46:42.560 --> 02:46:44.560]  and then like these preachers say well that's an
[02:46:44.560 --> 02:46:46.560]  interpretation or that's an allegory
[02:46:46.560 --> 02:46:48.560]  but then the same preachers will tell you the whole Bible's
[02:46:48.560 --> 02:46:50.560]  literal nothing's an allegory unless
[02:46:50.560 --> 02:46:52.560]  they say it's an allegory
[02:46:52.560 --> 02:46:56.560]  because they can't deal with what's in the Bible
[02:46:56.560 --> 02:46:58.560]  but look at what the elite's doing today
[02:46:58.560 --> 02:47:00.560]  trying to change the genetics of humans
[02:47:00.560 --> 02:47:02.560]  trying to cross us with animals
[02:47:02.560 --> 02:47:06.560]  trying to defile the genetics
[02:47:06.560 --> 02:47:08.560]  this is going on today
[02:47:08.560 --> 02:47:10.560]  so it's just very interesting how everything in the Bible
[02:47:10.560 --> 02:47:12.560]  just keeps happening over and over again
[02:47:12.560 --> 02:47:14.560]  what you see John talk about on the Isle of Patmos
[02:47:14.560 --> 02:47:16.560]  is happening now
[02:47:16.560 --> 02:47:18.560]  the Bible's profound folks you just cannot deny it
[02:47:18.560 --> 02:47:20.560]  so I went to the movie Noah
[02:47:20.560 --> 02:47:22.560]  and I would say that
[02:47:22.560 --> 02:47:24.560]  it's very well done
[02:47:24.560 --> 02:47:26.560]  it's got a pro-human bent from Cain
[02:47:26.560 --> 02:47:28.560]  where Cain
[02:47:28.560 --> 02:47:30.560]  is all about men's will and building things
[02:47:30.560 --> 02:47:32.560]  so he's bad
[02:47:32.560 --> 02:47:34.560]  that is not the biblical representation of Cain
[02:47:34.560 --> 02:47:36.560]  and it really demonizes libertarian ideas
[02:47:38.560 --> 02:47:40.560]  but I think the makers of the film
[02:47:40.560 --> 02:47:42.560]  meant well I mean it had some good messages
[02:47:42.560 --> 02:47:44.560]  overall
[02:47:44.560 --> 02:47:46.560]  the Nephilim were the offspring of sons of God
[02:47:46.560 --> 02:47:48.560]  and daughters of men
[02:47:48.560 --> 02:47:50.560]  according to Genesis 6.4
[02:47:50.560 --> 02:47:52.560]  and giants who inhabited Cain
[02:47:52.560 --> 02:47:54.560]  according to Numbers 1333
[02:47:54.560 --> 02:47:56.560]  a similar biblical Hebrew word
[02:47:56.560 --> 02:47:58.560]  with different vowel sounds
[02:47:58.560 --> 02:48:00.560]  using Ezekiel 3227
[02:48:00.560 --> 02:48:02.560]  to refer to dead
[02:48:02.560 --> 02:48:04.560]  Philistine warriors
[02:48:04.560 --> 02:48:06.560]  well that was the word as some of the Philistines
[02:48:06.560 --> 02:48:08.560]  had the bloodline of Cain and so they were like 12 feet tall
[02:48:08.560 --> 02:48:10.560]  and this is in the Roman
[02:48:10.560 --> 02:48:12.560]  histories as well folks
[02:48:12.560 --> 02:48:14.560]  and you look at some of the people like in Slovakia
[02:48:14.560 --> 02:48:16.560]  and Serbia
[02:48:16.560 --> 02:48:18.560]  so you know I mean a lot of this could just be
[02:48:18.560 --> 02:48:20.560]  you know
[02:48:20.560 --> 02:48:22.560]  more legends or whatever
[02:48:22.560 --> 02:48:24.560]  I'm not even sitting here saying that
[02:48:24.560 --> 02:48:26.560]  but then the preachers can have it both ways
[02:48:26.560 --> 02:48:28.560]  and say it's legends but then it's not legends
[02:48:28.560 --> 02:48:30.560]  you see what I'm saying
[02:48:30.560 --> 02:48:32.560]  and then it just goes over
[02:48:32.560 --> 02:48:34.560]  the giants and that's basically
[02:48:34.560 --> 02:48:36.560]  in the movie
[02:48:36.560 --> 02:48:38.560]  now it came about
[02:48:38.560 --> 02:48:40.560]  when men began to multiply on the face of the land
[02:48:40.560 --> 02:48:42.560]  and the daughters were born to them
[02:48:42.560 --> 02:48:44.560]  that the sons of God saw the daughters of men
[02:48:44.560 --> 02:48:46.560]  beautiful
[02:48:46.560 --> 02:48:48.560]  see the sons of God
[02:48:48.560 --> 02:48:50.560]  were the bloodline
[02:48:50.560 --> 02:48:52.560]  that God did want to destroy
[02:48:52.560 --> 02:48:54.560]  then there were the daughters
[02:48:54.560 --> 02:48:56.560]  of men
[02:48:56.560 --> 02:48:58.560]  and they took wives for themselves
[02:48:58.560 --> 02:49:00.560]  whomever they chose
[02:49:00.560 --> 02:49:02.560]  then the Lord said
[02:49:02.560 --> 02:49:04.560]  my spirit shall not strive with man
[02:49:04.560 --> 02:49:06.560]  forever because he is also
[02:49:06.560 --> 02:49:08.560]  in flesh
[02:49:08.560 --> 02:49:10.560]  nevertheless his days shall be 120 years
[02:49:10.560 --> 02:49:12.560]  before men were living longer
[02:49:12.560 --> 02:49:14.560]  and also degraded
[02:49:14.560 --> 02:49:16.560]  the Nephilim were on the earth in those days
[02:49:16.560 --> 02:49:18.560]  and also afterward where the sons of God
[02:49:18.560 --> 02:49:20.560]  came and the daughters of men
[02:49:20.560 --> 02:49:22.560]  and they bore children to them
[02:49:22.560 --> 02:49:24.560]  they were the mighty men who were
[02:49:24.560 --> 02:49:26.560]  of old men of renown
[02:49:26.560 --> 02:49:28.560]  the second
[02:49:28.560 --> 02:49:30.560]  in Numbers 13
[02:49:30.560 --> 02:49:32.560]  3233 in AS
[02:49:32.560 --> 02:49:34.560]  were the 12 spies
[02:49:34.560 --> 02:49:36.560]  report on
[02:49:36.560 --> 02:49:38.560]  the fearsome giants
[02:49:38.560 --> 02:49:40.560]  so they gave out to the sons of Israel
[02:49:40.560 --> 02:49:42.560]  the report of the land
[02:49:42.560 --> 02:49:44.560]  where they had spied out saying
[02:49:44.560 --> 02:49:46.560]  the land through which we have gone
[02:49:46.560 --> 02:49:48.560]  in spying out in the land that devours its inhabitants
[02:49:48.560 --> 02:49:50.560]  and all the people whom we saw in them
[02:49:50.560 --> 02:49:52.560]  were of giant size
[02:49:52.560 --> 02:49:54.560]  also we saw the Nephilim
[02:49:54.560 --> 02:49:56.560]  the sons of
[02:49:56.560 --> 02:49:58.560]  Anak are part of the Nephilim
[02:49:58.560 --> 02:50:00.560]  and we became like grasshoppers
[02:50:00.560 --> 02:50:02.560]  in our own sight
[02:50:02.560 --> 02:50:04.560]  and so we were in their sight
[02:50:04.560 --> 02:50:06.560]  and it just goes on
[02:50:06.560 --> 02:50:08.560]  so that's what it deals with
[02:50:08.560 --> 02:50:10.560]  but the overall message
[02:50:10.560 --> 02:50:12.560]  for the Dumbo's out there
[02:50:12.560 --> 02:50:14.560]  is humans are bad and humans destroy everything
[02:50:14.560 --> 02:50:16.560]  and cities are bad
[02:50:16.560 --> 02:50:18.560]  and science and technology
[02:50:18.560 --> 02:50:20.560]  is bad and Noah
[02:50:20.560 --> 02:50:22.560]  almost kills
[02:50:22.560 --> 02:50:24.560]  the two daughters that are born
[02:50:24.560 --> 02:50:26.560]  because
[02:50:26.560 --> 02:50:28.560]  he thinks God wants humans to be removed
[02:50:28.560 --> 02:50:30.560]  from the earth and it's kind of like Bill Gates
[02:50:30.560 --> 02:50:32.560]  is the new Noah and he's doing what
[02:50:32.560 --> 02:50:34.560]  he has to do to remove the scourge
[02:50:34.560 --> 02:50:36.560]  from the planet earth of those that are not pure
[02:50:36.560 --> 02:50:38.560]  so it's the same old story eugenics
[02:50:38.560 --> 02:50:40.560]  everything is eugenics
[02:50:40.560 --> 02:50:42.560]  Plato, 3,000 years ago
[02:50:42.560 --> 02:50:44.560]  or a little less
[02:50:44.560 --> 02:50:46.560]  it was all about kill almost everybody but the elite
[02:50:46.560 --> 02:50:48.560]  I mean this is what governs the debate
[02:50:48.560 --> 02:50:50.560]  so whether you believe it's true or not
[02:50:50.560 --> 02:50:52.560]  the point is it's the debate going back
[02:50:52.560 --> 02:50:54.560]  6,000 years
[02:50:54.560 --> 02:50:56.560]  it's what goes on, it's what's discussed
[02:50:56.560 --> 02:50:58.560]  this is what the elite talk about
[02:50:58.560 --> 02:51:00.560]  we talk about it
[02:51:00.560 --> 02:51:06.560]  it's time to kick some ash
[02:51:06.560 --> 02:51:08.560]  because cigarettes have met their match

[03:00:34.320 --> 03:00:42.040]  a generic name of the drug that he was on, and it says that it's a sedative hypnotic.
[03:00:42.040 --> 03:00:43.040]  That's right.
[03:00:43.040 --> 03:00:47.480]  The Ambien is in the psychotropic sedative hypnotic class.
[03:00:47.480 --> 03:00:52.600]  It's worse than most psychotropics, and then the next person says, you utter ignorant slave.
[03:00:52.600 --> 03:00:57.000]  The U.S. Army has stated he was on a cocktail of drugs for depression and sleep disorders.
[03:00:57.000 --> 03:01:00.440]  The Ambien was for the sleep disorder, the SSRI for depression.
[03:01:00.440 --> 03:01:02.040]  Now go suck on your government.
[03:01:02.040 --> 03:01:03.040]  You know what?
[03:01:03.040 --> 03:01:07.360]  So I love how folks counter the folks that go, you're a tinfoil.
[03:01:07.360 --> 03:01:12.880]  I mean Ambien, the insert says, can make you a murdering zombie, and I'm sick of people
[03:01:12.880 --> 03:01:19.120]  that go tinfoil, conspiracy when we're informed, like that makes you an intellectual giant.
[03:01:19.120 --> 03:01:23.400]  So I'm glad folks are countering you with links to what the drug does.
[03:01:23.400 --> 03:01:27.880]  I mean Ambien is horrible, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:01:27.880 --> 03:01:30.960]  A lot of people can take it safely, but it doesn't matter, it's Russian roulette.
[03:01:30.960 --> 03:01:33.600]  And they've got shit points to stop drunk drivers.
[03:01:33.600 --> 03:01:35.680]  I mean, compared to this stuff, it's nothing.
[03:01:35.680 --> 03:01:39.360]  Let's talk to Brian, previously attended Fort Hood, and then Dylan, cousin currently in
[03:01:39.360 --> 03:01:40.760]  Fort Hood, last two calls.
[03:01:40.760 --> 03:01:42.440]  Brian, tell us what happened.
[03:01:42.440 --> 03:01:43.920]  Hi, Alex.
[03:01:43.920 --> 03:01:49.680]  Basically, I was there teaching a class at the Air Force, and I left a day before the
[03:01:49.680 --> 03:01:54.720]  attack happened, and it was really surreal to see the president there a couple days
[03:01:54.720 --> 03:01:58.280]  later, right next to where I was going every day for two weeks.
[03:01:58.280 --> 03:02:00.680]  You're talking about the shooting with Major Hassan?
[03:02:00.680 --> 03:02:03.520]  Yes, that shooting.
[03:02:03.520 --> 03:02:06.200]  There was a video showing him going into a 7-Eleven.
[03:02:06.200 --> 03:02:11.000]  I went into that 7-Eleven every morning to get coffee, and I taught a lot of guys there,
[03:02:11.000 --> 03:02:14.280]  so I was really worried about how they were doing.
[03:02:14.280 --> 03:02:22.680]  But I know firsthand, and you're exactly right with the drugs, they're not fixing the issue.
[03:02:22.680 --> 03:02:26.920]  They're not looking at the issue, they're just throwing pills at these troops, thinking
[03:02:26.920 --> 03:02:30.120]  it's going to fix the problem, but that's not the problem.
[03:02:30.120 --> 03:02:34.120]  These guys are deploying a lot, they're under a lot of pressure with work.
[03:02:34.120 --> 03:02:41.400]  The force is shrinking, everybody's worried about their jobs, and pills aren't the answer.
[03:02:41.400 --> 03:02:45.040]  A lot of the military I've talked to here on air, people I know, friends of mine who
[03:02:45.040 --> 03:02:50.760]  were in the regular army, you name it, they throw regular drugs, opiates at them to get
[03:02:50.760 --> 03:02:54.200]  them addicted to control them, I mean, it's crazy.
[03:02:54.200 --> 03:03:02.600]  Yeah, yeah, I would believe that, and I mean, I was given that sleeping pill you were talking
[03:03:02.600 --> 03:03:08.200]  about, Ambien, on some deployments for sleep, and some people would even get the stronger
[03:03:08.200 --> 03:03:15.200]  version called Restorol, and there's the pill-popping culture, and you know.
[03:03:15.200 --> 03:03:19.240]  It's sick, it's sick, and then meanwhile there's a war on drugs, and all these pharmaceuticals
[03:03:19.240 --> 03:03:20.240]  are even worse.
[03:03:20.240 --> 03:03:21.800]  Thanks for your information, sir.
[03:03:21.800 --> 03:03:25.360]  Last caller, Dylan Cousin, currently in Fort Hood, locked down yesterday.
[03:03:25.360 --> 03:03:26.360]  Go ahead.
[03:03:26.360 --> 03:03:33.160]  Yeah, I've got a Facebook message from my cousin's wife, she had to stay in her house,
[03:03:33.160 --> 03:03:37.800]  you know, like you said, and he couldn't even get across the base tour, I guess while this
[03:03:37.800 --> 03:03:44.240]  guy's going on this rampage, on the Ambien sleep aids.
[03:03:44.240 --> 03:03:53.120]  I got a few friends that are on those, I definitely wouldn't get on those, but yeah, Alex, you're
[03:03:53.120 --> 03:03:54.120]  a real hero.
[03:03:54.120 --> 03:03:59.280]  Oh, no, I'm not, I just want my freedom, I'm just the same guy trying to bail here, you
[03:03:59.280 --> 03:04:00.280]  know, trying to get water out of the boat.
[03:04:00.280 --> 03:04:05.960]  Trying to fight the info war up here in Iowa, but yeah, that's all I got.
