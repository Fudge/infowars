[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.000]  InfoWars. Tomorrow's News. Today.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:59.760]  Ex-head of Respiratory Research at Pfizer, Mike Yeadon, and researchers
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.320]  including Craig Pardecouper have sourced VAERS data on vaccine death and injury in the U.S.,
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:15.440]  a database of over 700,000 adverse reactions caused by the Moderna, Pfizer, and Janssen vaccines.
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:21.760]  These vaccines have been deployed in different batches, officially referred to as LOTS. This
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.920]  has allowed Yeadon's team to back-engineer Big Pharma's COVID-19 vaccine deployment agenda
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:35.200]  in the U.S. All their information is published at howbadismybatch.com and howbad.info.
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:42.560]  And what we learn is quite telling. About 0.5% of all the different batches are highly toxic,
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.880]  resulting in hospitalization, disability, and death within days or weeks of injection.
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.880]  Other batches cause minimal adverse reactions and most appear to be harmless placebos.
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.880]  When plotting on a timeline, we can see that these three companies have been working together
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:07.360]  to quietly monitor the lethal effectiveness of specific deadly batches. While one company is
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:13.360]  deploying a lethal batch, the other two deploy harmless ones, creating the scientific environment
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:19.760]  to perform dose range finding, or the maximum tolerated dose for each specific batch.
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.480]  The timeline shows that each lethal batch deployment is preceded and followed by a quiet
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.240]  period, allowing them time to establish their baseline before the next deadly batch is deployed.
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.440]  Private leaked documents from the CDC show a list of expiry dates, and only certain LOTS
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.960]  are included, the very same LOTS found to be highly toxic in part of Cooper's database.
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.800]  Which makes sense, there would be no reason to list expiration dates for saline placebo,
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:57.440]  only the deadly ones. This mode of deployment allows governments the ability to direct
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:04.960]  deadly batches into specific populations, such as red states. Analysis of the number of dying
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:11.520]  per 100,000 vaccinated in 50 states shows us that the overwhelming majority of vaccine deaths
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:18.400]  are happening in red states. Some red states are experiencing 11 times more vaccine deaths
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.440]  than other states. On average, red states are experiencing twice the amount of vaccine
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.320]  death and injuries than blue states. After ruling out other possibilities,
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.600]  part of Cooper concluded that this can only be due to the fact that red states received at least
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:40.400]  twice as much of the lethal batches than blue states did. Among several other crimes,
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.440]  they are tipping the scales of the democratic process by killing people who voted against
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:52.480]  the New World Order's WOKE BUILD BACK BETTER GREAT RESET, while at the same time endlessly
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:58.160]  flooding the borders with unvaccinated foreigners. And it's happening right now.
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.920]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:35.200]  And why have we heard that report 15 times? Because it was independent U.S. researchers
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:41.040]  that early on went and studied the adverse reaction reports and the different regions
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:46.320]  and then the lot numbers on those. And they found that in certain regions, you would have
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:52.320]  massive illness and side effect and death rates. And then in other areas, you would have moderate.
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:58.240]  And in other areas, you'd have zero, zero. Now, this was confirmed a year and a half ago,
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:05.040]  really two years ago. InfoWarsStore.com is like a grocery store or like a vitamin shop.

[00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:15.440]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. Live from Freedom Command Central,
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000]  it's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:32.240]  June 29, 2023. And the globalists are bringers of death. They are engaging in massive depopulation
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:37.520]  operations and crimes against humanity. They're standardizing and normalizing the mass killing
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:45.200]  and murder for sterilization of our species. They are playing God. Now I got up early this
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:50.560]  morning. I was doing research and went to InfoWars.com and got hit by a thunderbolt of
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:57.520]  information. And then I got hit by a thunderbolt of anger, not at the enemy, but at myself.
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:03.120]  I have a problem. You have a problem. We all have a problem. And it's that we don't stay focused
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:08.000]  and we don't think long term and we don't think back historically as well. We don't have 35,000
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.800]  foot views. We have one inch away views. You can't tell it's an elephant when you're one inch
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:19.440]  away from its hind end. We got to pull back and look at the full compendium. Now it was two years
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:23.920]  ago that they started the poison shots, two plus years ago. In three and a half years, this nightmare
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:31.360]  began. And immediately there were groups and organizations and medical think tanks and
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:39.120]  watchdogs that tested Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, and J&J shots all over the world from Australia to
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:46.000]  the United States, from Canada to Germany. It all happened. And they found that a certain portion
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:08:01.040]  was water, saline solution, around 50 percent. And then another 25 percent or so had a very
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:06.160]  small amount of the spike protein and the mRNA garbage in it and all the nanolipid,
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:14.240]  basically fancy, souped up antifreeze in it. But then around 25 percent, and it varies country to
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:21.040]  country, sometimes it's only 5 percent, of the injections had a super high level that always
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:27.360]  made people sick and had a very high percentage rate of heart attacks and strokes, cancer,
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:34.160]  sterilization, you name it, and shedding. Now, Greg Reese, over a year and a half ago, put out
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:41.520]  a report titled, Red States Being Targeted by the COVID Shots. We'll put that on screen,
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.240]  the actual headline. I'm going from memory. We're going to air it again in a moment.
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:50.800]  And now, since then, more and more research groups and more and more prestigious think tanks and
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:56.240]  watchdog groups have gone out and studied the shots. There it is, evidence that U.S. government
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:04.080]  targeting red states with deadly batches of vaccine. Now, that is January 11th, 2022. So,
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:11.200]  that's a year and a half ago. That's a cool 18 months ago. All right. Now, since then,
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:16.640]  more has come out on this. And I see the reports all the time and don't even talk about it,
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:22.160]  because psychologically and mentally, I already know this. In fact, as listeners and viewers,
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:27.600]  you already know this. But think of the true horror. It's like if we discover Jeffrey Dahmer,
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:32.080]  back at the time, was kidnapping men and injecting acid in their brains to create lobotomized sex
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:35.680]  slaves. And we went, well, we know he's doing it. We're not going to call the police or go stop him.
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:40.080]  And then you just learn, oh, there he is kidnapping another man to do it again.
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.920]  We're not going to stop him. Or John Wayne Gacy doing the same thing.
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:49.200]  We know they're doing it. They're gearing up to do it again. And you may ask, why would J&J,
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:57.200]  AstraZeneca, Moderna, and Pfizer, three different types of vaccines? Pfizer and Moderna are the
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:04.880]  Pentagon-developed, Fauci-developed, spike protein, nanotech, mRNA system. The virus
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:09.760]  vector of AstraZeneca and J&J are two different virus vectors that do the exact same thing and
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:13.200]  probably were worse. That's why they pulled them earlier. They were so devastating that
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:20.000]  it was just, if you got the shot, if there was actually that compound in there,
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:24.880]  and it went in and reprogrammed your cell with a virus, you were in deep trouble.
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:30.160]  So J&J, AstraZeneca, those got pulled very quick because they were told by the Pentagon,
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.360]  turns out a year before they released code, but they already developed all this. Well,
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.760]  there's the patents, the numbers. You look all this up, everything I'm saying, you look up.
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:40.720]  And Dr. David Martin does a great job exposing it, probably the best job.
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:45.280]  But it's all in the documents. This is totally evil, totally psychotic. And they think we're
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:49.760]  so dumb, they did it openly because they wanted to get all the medical systems and governments
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:58.240]  on board. We're going to skip this break. They wanted to do all of this so that they would
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.760]  corrupt everybody and everybody would be involved, the law firms, the governments,
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:05.360]  the governments would be signed on to liability protection. So we know all this. And you're
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:11.360]  like, well, why are you talking about today? Major European watchdog groups, major European
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:18.320]  professors, major respected groups that report to the government have studied the EU batches.
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:25.040]  And not only, if you look at the data, did it target conservative and Christian and elderly
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:31.120]  areas for death, but it targeted different geographic areas in Europe with more deadly
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:38.320]  shots. Now, we knew this. The left, on average, if the conservative areas, depending on which
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:42.720]  area they study, but it varies, it was basically the same numbers. A conservative red area would
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:50.320]  get 25% souped up death shot. Remember, there's placebo, saline solution, saltwater, does nothing.
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:53.520]  In fact, it's good for you, a little bit of it. There's the same thing you put in your veins
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:12:00.080]  when you're dehydrated. There's saline, and then your teardrops are. There's saline,
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:09.680]  there is a low-dose system that creates a spike protein, orders your body to produce this
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:13.520]  deadly cancerous, deadly system that your own body attacks and eats holes in your capillaries
[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:17.840]  and arteries. This is just a psychotic death weapon. And then there's the third one. So
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:26.480]  the super deadly, it's really strong. So three different systems, but the Pfizer's two different
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:32.880]  dose levels in a shot. And so they have now gone and looked, and it's the same thing in the U.S.
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:41.280]  Conservative areas were literally bombed, 25%. Leftist areas, around 10% was the super death
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:46.720]  shot. So they've actually created a system where they're euthanizing conservatives and Christians
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:53.200]  through the injections, but if the leftists are all dying or aren't dying, it becomes obvious,
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:13:00.080]  well, why aren't they dying? So, okay, they die roughly a third as much. And then if you're in
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:04.880]  conservative rural areas, like in Austin, Texas, they control it. The study shows they sent the
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:09.440]  10% in, on average. Remember, you're carpet bombing. So they're going to get some of their
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:15.600]  people too, but they're going to miss some conservatives as well. So the same thing like
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:19.680]  dropping nuclear weapons on cities, people just don't know they've been hit. So New York, San
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:26.960]  Francisco, Los Angeles, they didn't get hit. They got hit with a 10%. Same thing in Australia.
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:31.760]  They hit their cities with about a 10%. Sometimes it's 7%, sometimes 12%. We have all the numbers.
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:37.200]  We're going to be showing it to you. Let's put this article up here and just show them some
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:41.840]  of the graphs out of European countries. It's all here. It's a huge report. Here it is on screen.
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:48.000]  This is just them, this watchdog group of prestigious scientists and university
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:54.720]  professors, looking at just Pfizer batches they got. Same thing with Moderna, same with all the
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:14:00.320]  others. Pfizer vaccine batches in the EU were placebo, says scientists. And then it goes on to
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:06.320]  say the others were not. And then they have the graph here we'll put on screen of the three
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:10.080]  indicators in three different colors. So we'll just scroll down in that article.
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:14.800]  Pfizer vaccine batches in the EU are placebo, say scientists. We'll just scroll in the article a
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:21.200]  little bit. You got to go read this. You got to see this for yourself. So look at the people that
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:27.600]  got the saline. That's in yellow. No adverse responses, zero, zero. This is in a sampling
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:33.920]  group of 800,000. Okay, this is just one country. And I'll go to, it's Denmark, Sweden, they looked
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:37.360]  at them all. And it's all the same graph everywhere. So no one gets sick from saline.
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:42.720]  And then look at the people that got the moderate death dose. It still gets them,
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:47.520]  but it takes longer and it's much lower. Now look what happened right away within just a few days.
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:54.640]  If you got the big daddy, you're dead in a week. That's what Ernest Ramirez and his son got.
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:59.920]  Or maybe in the lot, he got a placebo and his son got the shot. They're all mixed together.
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:06.880]  They got different lot numbers. So there you go. We got to ask Ernest, did they go together to get
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:11.200]  the shot or were they separate? I imagine they're probably separate. He went and got one and his son
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:17.120]  got the other. And Ernest Jr., dead in four days like that. Starts running on the playground, bye-bye.
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:24.720]  Good shape, not overweight, bye-bye. No heart problems, bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye, Bluebird.
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:29.680]  Because this is all about their power, their control. The health departments were set up in
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:36.000]  England 120 years ago and here 110 years ago by the Rockefellers, by the eugenicists at Cold Springs
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:42.480]  Harbor that created the Nazis later, literally to, quote, sanitize the races. And they said,
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:45.200]  we're going to kill the dumb white people. We're going to kill the dumb black people.
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:53.680]  We're going to kill everybody according to their IQ. And if you got a B- in the Appalachian
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:58.480]  Mountains in the 20s, they came and sterilized you. It's the same thing to black people.
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:04.560]  And so just know, this is all going on. So this is a prestigious report.
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:10.080]  What we're showing you is just batches in Denmark, 800,000 plus people looked at
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:16.640]  by the universities. This is a prestigious group of scientists and universities, all on record.
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:22.240]  Scientists have uncovered startling evidence that a substantial portion of the batches of the
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:27.440]  Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine deployed in the European Union may in fact have consisted
[00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:31.520]  of the placebos, may in fact. The German regulator knew this and did not subject them
[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:35.120]  to quality control testing because it was all part of a plan. They already signed off. Remember,
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:39.520]  it was unapproved and there was nothing. They wouldn't tell you what was in each shot because
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:46.480]  it was all variant. The scientists, Dr. Gerald Diker, Professor of Organic Chemistry at Ruhr
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:52.880]  University in Bochum and Dr. Gorg Matyska, Professor of Analytical Chemistry at the
[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:57.360]  University of Leipzig, are part of a group of five German-speaking scientists who have been
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:01.760]  publicly raising questions about the quality and safety of BioNTech in a virus, as it's known in
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:06.560]  Germany, for the last year and a half. They recently appeared in a bunch of publications,
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:13.440]  online program of the German journalist Melinia Krevrovac, to discuss batch vulnerability.
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:19.360]  Their startling point was the direct recent Danish study showing enormous variance in the
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:47.760]  adverse events associated with different batches of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, or BNT162b2,
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:53.440]  per the scientific code name. The below figure for the Danish study illustrates the variation.
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:57.040]  It's a government study, 100,000 people. Now, you put that in your pipe and smoke it.
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:04.240]  Saline, zero problems. The weak dose, fast death, but still at one in 400.
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:10.480]  The other people, everybody, or 80% had adverse effects. Remember what Bill Gates got asked
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:15.280]  in a study once the shots started. They didn't study before. The CBS reporter goes,
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:19.120]  Mr. Gates, 80% of people had adverse reactions. He goes, well, yeah.
[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:24.560]  That's when they were giving them a straight up deal. The regulators were balking and weren't
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:29.280]  approving. They said, how about we just do saline and we make sure, and then we'll be able to tell
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:32.800]  if it's safe or not. Of course, they knew it wasn't safe from the beginning. They knew what
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:38.000]  it was going to do. For people that aren't totally psychotic and evil, but are on power trips,
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.200]  well, we've got to do it for the greater good. This will save millions of lives,
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:45.120]  but it will also kill millions. We'll learn valuable things, the secret of the universe,
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:51.920]  but the public's not ready for that yet. Then baked into that, the socialist and communist
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:57.920]  controlled cities, they don't hit them with a 25% serious adverse reaction.
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:05.280]  Shot, 25% in the conservative areas worldwide. Rural areas of Australia, bombed. Rural areas of
[00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:12.720]  England, bombed. Rural areas of Scotland, bombed. Rural areas of, you name it, bombed. Rural areas
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:18.000]  of Canada, bombed. Conservative, and that's how they send the batches. Gregg Reese shows
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.600]  in his report from a year and a half ago from the major watchdog groups that collated all the
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:25.200]  numbers, folks, because the numbers are public, but our government doesn't do studies on it.
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:29.360]  So it's the same everywhere. They are bombing us. They are killing us. They are literally
[00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:32.800]  targeting us. Your church gets roped into it. It's a conservative church. They've been
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:40.240]  lied to. They think it's good. You get the 10%, the 30%, the 25%. They send it out. So they know
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:46.240]  exactly what they're doing. And so the military, oh, the military has just been devastated with
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:52.320]  the shots. But strangely enough, special units and the units they do are basically all conservative.
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:59.840]  They got the special shots, the specially deadly ones, and everybody else got the placebos,
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:03.680]  or they mixed in a little bit of a weak shot. So there'd be a little sickness, a little death
[00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:09.840]  there because it gets a little too obvious when only the Republican counties are killing over
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:17.280]  dead. So think of the level, the biological weapon systems. Let's put today's live show
[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:20.800]  headline up. I hope you'll share with everybody this is a life and death situation. This isn't
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:25.600]  a drill. It's not a joke. It's happening. And this is the reality of what we're facing,
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:31.040]  ladies and gentlemen. So again, if you go to Infowars.com, we always put up a live show feed.
[00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:36.320]  Nightmare bombshell. Group of top European scientists have confirmed Pfizer COVID vaccine
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:45.920]  was a giant biological weapons test. And ladies and gentlemen, that's what this was.
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:52.640]  A giant biological weapons test. This is a nanotech biological system, whether it's
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:58.160]  the virus vector or whether it is the mRNA delivery that orders your cells to replicate
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:02.800]  the spike protein of the HIV virus. Now, I know if you're a new listener, that sounds completely
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:10.800]  insane, like Martians blowing up New York. Anybody can search engine, what is the Pfizer mRNA spike
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:17.200]  protein made of? And it'll pull up the HIV spike protein that they've learned how to grow in a lab.
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:26.320]  It is a synthetic virus mRNA system that keeps replicating like a prion. It is a prion.
[00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:32.240]  And what do prions cause? Little protein crystals that grow in their body.
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:38.160]  Spongiform encephalopathy, or what causes what? Bad cow disease.
[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:45.200]  We have all the insurance company actuaries. We have all the one of the top. I mean,
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:50.560]  said to me, the top guy was Edward Dowd's whistleblower two and a half years ago.
[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:53.840]  And he said he'll be coming public soon. And he did come public a year later with a bunch of
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:22:01.200]  other scientists and experts and statisticians. And they said, on average, we have a 44% increase
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:06.080]  in death in the world in countries that took the shots. 44% increase in death. Again,
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:09.440]  it was less than 10% in World War I and World War II, and that killed hundreds of millions of people.
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:17.040]  So you sit back and you look at this. The magnitude of this information, ladies and
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:20.720]  gentlemen, is just over the top. Everyone I know has family that died from a shot. Everybody that
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:27.760]  works or is almost dead. It's just complete devastation. I have an assistant and a nanny.
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:35.040]  Both of them have family. And one of them had a fiance that had no heart problems, was an athlete,
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:40.640]  25 years old. And now he has myocarditis so bad, they say he'll be dead in a couple of years. He
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:46.880]  passes out all the time. Just passes out. I mean, the other assistant has a family member that took
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:51.600]  the shot and died three years later of a heart attack and was in good shape. So, I mean,
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:56.400]  we have anecdotal, we have it all around us. I could open the phones up here today.
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:03.840]  I could open the phones up here today. And I could just take nothing but calls. I'd say,
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:06.160]  hey, Colin, if you love the shot, it had a great effect. Nobody calls.
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:10.000]  Colin tells what happened with the shot. You've heard the days. We do three,
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.760]  four hours of calls, like 50 calls. Every person talks about what it did to their family or did to
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:25.280]  them. So that's where we are here, ladies and gentlemen. So about three weeks ago, Dr. Peter
[00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:32.960]  McCullough, who's a very renowned cardiologist, he was asked last year by Joe Rogan why some people
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:36.240]  get sick and some don't. And I remember when that happened, I said, well, if Joe Rogan asked me,
[00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:38.640]  I could have told him. It was our reports were out. We don't have scientists on. But
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:46.880]  McCullough is always so careful that he didn't go there and said, I don't know. He said, I don't know
[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:51.760]  because it hadn't been documented yet. But now it's documented in all these studies that indeed,
[00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:56.880]  government worldwide from New Zealand, Australia, to the Western Europe, to the UK,
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:03.040]  to the United States, only these countries, all under King Charles, says he's going to depopulate
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:05.840]  us. He said he wants to come back, his dad wants to come back as a virus to kill 80% of us.
[00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:13.600]  We're under their control and they're literally killing us. And they know exactly what they're
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:19.920]  doing and they have attacked us. And so understand, ladies and gentlemen, that this is ongoing.
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:25.200]  They're gearing up to do this again. And we have to take this extremely,
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:30.240]  extremely seriously. This happened. And now Dr. Peter McCullough has come out and said,
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:34.400]  no, we now have the studies. We have the documents. We have the proof.
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:37.680]  And here is a short clip, a three and a half minute clip of him breaking it down.
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:44.880]  So to summarize, there are four domains of injury, cardiovascular, neurologic, thrombotic
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:52.720]  and immunologic. The hardest question I've faced so far in all of my appearances in the media,
[00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:59.120]  and I've probably given more media appearances now than any public figure in the world on COVID-19.
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:04.960]  The question came from Joe Rogan on his podcast in 2021. He said, Dr. McCullough,
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:12.320]  if these vaccines are so bad, why doesn't everybody have a side effect and are damaged
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:17.920]  after the vaccines? I didn't have the answer at that time, but I have it now.
[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:26.800]  A paper by Schmeling and colleagues from Denmark has clearly shown that the batches of vaccines
[00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:33.840]  that come out, the lots groupings are not the same. They had all the Pfizer data administered
[00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:39.280]  in Denmark and they had every side effect. They found three risk groups of batches.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.600]  The first batch, which was about a third of people who got the vaccine,
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:49.520]  zero side effects, nothing whatsoever. It was like taking a shot of saline, nothing.
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:54.560]  The second group, which is about two thirds, had some moderate side effects,
[00:25:55.600 --> 00:26:00.160]  but the rate of serious side effects was pretty low. Then there's a third group,
[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:07.440]  which is 4.2% of the vials, their side effect rate was through the roof.
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:11.040]  When they did what's called an R-squared analysis, that is how much of the variation
[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:16.880]  in side effects is explained by this batch to batch variability. The answer was 75% plus.
[00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:23.280]  That means we have a product manufacturing problem. Either the vials, these files,
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:29.200]  and unfortunately, these two ladies almost certainly received a bad batch. These vials
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:34.000]  either have hyperconcentrated lipid nanoparticles and excessive amounts of messenger RNA.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.880]  In the United States, 94% of people who took a shot took messenger RNA, so we can stay on that
[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:45.680]  that technology. The other possibilities is that it could be contaminated with what's called
[00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:53.040]  cDNA or plasmids or other contaminants. It's certainly possible. I think hyperconcentration
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:58.080]  of messenger RNA is most likely because what we're seeing are messenger RNA spike protein
[00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:04.560]  mediated injuries. But Senator Ron Johnson, just from the VAERS data, had sent analysis to the CDC
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:10.880]  on this and the FDA asking for them to analyze the lot-to-lot variations that we're seeing,
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:15.280]  and he received a multi-page letter back that essentially says, we disagree. We don't see any
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:21.520]  difference in lot-to-lot. Now it's in the peer-reviewed publication forever in medical history
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:28.400]  showing it is a batch variability problem. Fortunately, most Americans received batch
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:34.080]  one or batch two. They're okay. Fortunately, they're fine. But for the small number of people
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:40.320]  who did receive a batch, we have big problems. A Zogby survey done last summer, a population-based
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:48.160]  sample, suggests 15% of Americans now have some injury, disability, or some medical problem due
[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:53.360]  to COVID-19. Let's stop right there. The full clip's being posted at InfoWars.com with a lot
[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:57.200]  of show feet. I'm not going to out Dr. Peter McCullough, but we've hung out quite a bit and
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:01.040]  had dinner and stuff, and he knows everything. He knows this is an intel op. He'll tell you
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:05.600]  the Pentagon did it on purpose. He's just being very careful here saying, oh, they might have
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:10.240]  contaminated it. No, it's the same all over the world. Again, it varies. In the U.S., it looks
[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:17.280]  like they hit, like I said, 10% with the really deadly, and then it varies. It varies also region
[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:21.600]  to region, but that's why the report by Greg Reese is so important because it links to the research
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:25.840]  groups that actually show what was happening in the U.S. over a year and a half ago. It's now
[00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:30.160]  been confirmed very similar things going on in Denmark. But it looks like in the E.U.,
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:33.920]  they weren't hitting them as hard as they hit us in the U.S. because the E.U.'s were controlled.
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:38.400]  But they still want to have some death. They also want to say COVID's doing it. So
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:42.240]  they're setting the precedent to kill us, to cover it up, and to make money while they do it.
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:47.040]  These are the very globals that say they want to depopulate us. So of course they're killing us.
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:50.320]  They want the power to do it. It really happened. It's really happening. And now they're getting
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:54.880]  ready to release a new virus, but with new shots. They're murderers. They must be stopped. We'll be
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:29:03.680]  right back. Stay with us. Infowarsstore.com is like a grocery store or like a vitamin shop.
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:07.680]  We want to have all the best brands for you. We want to have a bunch of different choices for you.
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:12.480]  So I get constant questions online and in person. Hey, what's better, knockout? What's better,
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:16.720]  down and out? What's better? Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:21.440]  And the answer is different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:27.120]  people. So one person might like this coffee. Another person likes that coffee. That's how our
[00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:32.080]  bodies work. They're all very diverse, but we've been able to private label a national bestseller
[00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:37.520]  that's been sold for many years that people love and sold for a lower price under the name Infowars

[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:09.440]  Two new incredible products are now available exclusively at Infowarsstore.com. They are both
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:15.040]  clones of national bestselling products from a major pharmaceutical slash supplement maker
[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:18.560]  that are listeners and patriots that are allowing us to private label it
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:24.400]  at a lower price you'll find in stores. It's Joint Relief Max and Nerve Renew.
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:31.520]  Both of these have known documented natural compounds to lower pain and also make your
[00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:36.640]  nerves healthier, which is one of the major reasons nerves get irritated and are more
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:42.560]  inductive to pain. There's major research behind this all. You need to get Joint Relief Max from
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:50.640]  Infowars MD and Nerve Renew from Infowars MD exclusively at Infowarsstore.com right now.
[00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:56.240]  Introducing them both 25% off. You'll find them exclusively at Infowarsstore.com and they fund
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:02.720]  their operation. You wanted to plug RainForce. Do you like RainForce? Yeah. So my name is Ken
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:07.760]  Heckin-Ladley. How do I write all the books that I do? Four books with Dr. Judy Majkowicz,
[00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:12.080]  four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers, and now two books with Alex Jones.
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:18.960]  That's because I use RainForce every day. What I always need is I always need some sort of boost
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:24.640]  in the morning. And so I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins. But the one thing that
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:31.280]  I have really found that makes a difference is RainForce. I'll take RainForce in the morning

[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:08.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:29.840]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups, you want to stop tyranny, well
[00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:30.840]  so does he.
[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:31.840]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:44.960]  So, if you look out your back door, let's just say you live in Knoxville, Tennessee,
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:48.320]  you live in a middle class, nice neighborhood, you got your little backyard, maybe a little
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:56.400]  pool or something, and you look out your back window, and you're eight year olds out there
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:34:01.880]  swimming, you're watching them, and you see a man come through your back gate and walk
[00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:09.080]  over and pour gasoline on your child with a gas can, now you're going to imagine he's
[00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:12.640]  about to pull a lighter out and set him on fire, this is psychotic, and so you're going
[00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:16.480]  to either have a gun right there or you're going to grab a butcher knife out of the butcher
[00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:20.840]  block where you're sitting there in the kitchen, maybe slicing a steak or something for, you
[00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:25.360]  know, the grill, and you're going to go out there and you're going to stab him, you're
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:28.880]  not going to tell him to stop, really, you're going to get him taken care of, you're not
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:30.880]  going to, you know, you're going to be in a rage, you're going to kill him, at least
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:31.880]  I would.
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:35.480]  I see somebody pouring gasoline on my kid, my six year old, I'm going to go out and I'm
[00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:36.480]  going to kill him.
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:39.160]  There's no ifs, ands, or buts, I thought I'm a tough guy, I have an instinct to stop it
[00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:40.720]  and to protect others, I'm going to kill him.
[00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:43.800]  He's going to be dead in about 30 seconds, I'm going to slit his throat, I'm going to
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:44.800]  stab him in the chest.
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:52.600]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, the New World Order is pouring poison bioweapon all over our children
[00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:56.480]  and all over us, and we just sit here and take it, and it's so scary that our government's
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:35:01.160]  been seized by psychotic depopulationists and transhumanists that we don't want to admit
[00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:03.440]  it, and we want to say Alex Jones is the bad guy.
[00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:07.920]  I've been told by high level Justice Department whistleblowers off air, I mean high level
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:12.120]  that, you know, they get the orders, you will indict Jones, you will find a case, it's been
[00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:17.200]  going on for at least seven, eight years, because he destabilizes our country, and people listen
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:21.480]  to him, and we've tracked back almost the entire resistance to Jones, and I'm not bragging,
[00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:25.640]  what's going on, that you can now see that, this audience, our guests, what we do here,
[00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:26.640]  not me.
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:30.000]  That's an important thing for my safety, and it's the truth, it's not me, it's this whole
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.880]  focal point, but this is God working through us, all of us together.
[00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:38.920]  Do those idiots think that that intimidates me, when I know that it's all coming out,
[00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:43.640]  that they knew these shots wouldn't protect you, and would destroy your immune system,
[00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:44.960]  would kill a bunch of people?
[00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:50.680]  No, I have a responsibility to get these people off of our collective backs, not because I'm
[00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:56.440]  a hero, but because I can face reality, and it's the same thing over and over again.
[00:35:56.440 --> 00:36:00.440]  Look at the craziness in our government, now you see it in Congress, they admit that our
[00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:03.840]  border patrol and our military, in order to complete the smuggling process of children
[00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:09.300]  in mass, many of them end up dead, their organs harvested, or in sex slavery, I've got articles
[00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:12.120]  on that today, we're gonna hit.
[00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:16.960]  So think about the country we live in, and the world we live in, where we don't stand
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:23.720]  up for each other, and where criminals, psychotic globalists, think they can get away with injecting
[00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:30.480]  us with bioweapons, but spreading it out where one person gets sick, one person feels fine,
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:36.080]  one person dies, and then just say, hey, the whole medical system went along with it, everybody
[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:38.360]  better get on board, or we're all gonna go down.
[00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:43.400]  See, they've gotten themselves a circle of the wagons, they've got society, the media,
[00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:49.000]  the PR firms, the bureaucrats, the censors, the big tech people, the medical people, to
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:54.840]  get on board with this, so they can do it on a bigger scale soon, and make no mistake,
[00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:58.080]  you will all pay for what you've done, not even by my hand.
[00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:02.680]  The globalists plan to get rid of at least 90% of people.
[00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:07.720]  So you'll hear me go through different numbers, where I'll say, oh, Prince Charles wants to
[00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:12.640]  kill 80%, his dad wants 80%, but the internal documents say 90%.
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:16.280]  It all varies, but when you get their public documents, they say 80% or 90%, because the
[00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:20.160]  minions believe they're gonna be the guardians, the ones carrying out the slow extermination,
[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:24.320]  where we don't notice it, but in the aggregate, it accelerates, with the ambient heat being
[00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:27.760]  turned up, the frog in the pod.
[00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:30.880]  They have to think, they have to have their minions believing that they're gonna be protected
[00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:32.880]  in this, though they're not.
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:36.160]  And a lot of the minions out there understand, it's like, wow, they still hit us with, you
[00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:42.080]  know, 10% of us are, in the case of Europe, 4% of us in liberal areas, they still hit us
[00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:44.560]  with this, and now 15% of us are sick.
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:45.560]  That's the left.
[00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:49.480]  In conservative areas, it's even higher, it's 30.
[00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:55.040]  And this is just the beginning to see if they can get away with this.
[00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:56.240]  Do you really think that's cool?
[00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:58.600]  And you're like, well, yeah, there are too many people, we gotta kill folks.
[00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:00.120]  So what you are is you're really evil.
[00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:01.120]  You like it.
[00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:03.520]  So let's understand.
[00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:04.720]  The left does like this.
[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:07.880]  The average leftist knows what's going on now, they've been educated, they know, and
[00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:08.880]  they like it.
[00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:09.880]  They like abortion.
[00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:10.880]  They like infanticide.
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:11.880]  They like sterilization.
[00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:12.880]  They like GMO.
[00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:13.880]  They like soy.
[00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:14.880]  They like 5G.
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:15.880]  They like coffin apartments.
[00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:16.880]  They like eating bugs.
[00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:17.880]  They like evil.
[00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:23.320]  Now, there are a lot of big, famous liberals going public and saying, I should never take
[00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:24.320]  them a shot.
[00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:25.320]  It's evil.
[00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:26.320]  It's bad.
[00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:27.320]  It hurt my friends and family.
[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:28.320]  We were lied to.
[00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:29.320]  Elon Musk's brother almost died.
[00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:30.320]  Elon Musk got sick.
[00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:35.560]  Elon Musk has one of his kids taken away, and they're gonna cut the penis off.
[00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:37.040]  You know, that's what's happened.
[00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:38.040]  That'll get you away here.
[00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:42.160]  Because not even Elon Musk's kids are safe from this.
[00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:45.360]  So folks, there's gonna be a time we're gonna decide to stand, because you're gonna have
[00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:47.400]  your survival instinct kick in at some point.
[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:52.160]  The enemy just hopes to have us so poisoned and so dumbed down and so isolated and so
[00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:56.640]  cut off resource-wise that by the time you figure it out, it's too late.
[00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:58.080]  Well, guess what?
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:00.200]  It's not too late now.
[00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:06.080]  And so I instinctively, on a spiritual level, have to fight this, and I know I'm right, and
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:09.280]  I know it's worse than I can even tell you.
[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:14.360]  I know Fauci went from being worth $100 million to $200 million during the pandemic.
[00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:17.280]  I know Hotez went from being worth $10 million to $35 million.
[00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:18.680]  That's what the money we know of.
[00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:22.760]  And think of the chicken feed they got paid by their bosses that made hundreds of billions.
[00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:27.880]  Pfizer made over $100 billion on their poison shot, and liability protection, and all the
[00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:28.880]  rest of it.
[00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:30.480]  It's not about that, folks.
[00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:33.040]  The money is just how they get their minions to go along.
[00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:36.920]  No, there's the groups up above it that are doing this that literally want to destroy
[00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:42.160]  our DNA, destroy our fertility, and that's what these shots really do to the majority
[00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:42.800]  of people that take them.
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:47.920]  It's not a side effect, though, that also kills you.
[00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:53.920]  It is a poisonous program against your body that grows protein crystals.
[00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:57.920]  Here's Fauci doubling his net worth during the pandemic.
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:02.920]  It was not a pandemic. It's the shots that caused the mass death.
[00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:04.920]  Here's another one. Then we'll go to these clips.
[00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:11.920]  Klaus Schwab praises CCP for its COVID control measures, says we need those here.
[00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:15.920]  See, at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Clinton Foundation, all of it.
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:19.920]  What do they say? They say, well, this showed us the public doesn't trust us,
[00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:21.920]  and people don't believe in medicine and science anymore.
[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:27.920]  You mean you hijacking it and weaponizing it, weaponizing medical information
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:31.920]  to terrorize the public, to scare them into submission to take more shots
[00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:34.920]  and use Pentagon mind-control programs on the public,
[00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:38.920]  every major ministry of defense doing the same thing.
[00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:40.920]  Chelsea Clinton saying nobody believes us anymore.
[00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:43.920]  Yeah, we don't believe you anymore. So her answer is we're going to double down.
[00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:45.920]  We're going to get more aggressive. We're going to lock you down harder.
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:48.920]  That'll make you submit. That'll break your will.
[00:40:49.810 --> 00:40:53.810]  When we come back, I'm going to play two Klaus Schwab clips back to back.
[00:40:53.810 --> 00:40:55.810]  One of the classics, and there's a new one,
[00:40:55.810 --> 00:41:00.810]  which is COVID is going to cause a breakdown of civilization and food and water and transportation.
[00:41:00.810 --> 00:41:05.810]  But it's not COVID. It's their lockdown that did it and the poison shots.
[00:41:05.810 --> 00:41:10.810]  Now, with 15 percent of the Western population sick and dying from the shots,
[00:41:10.810 --> 00:41:16.810]  in Vietnam, they love to wound somebody because they found that wounding an enemy soldier
[00:41:16.810 --> 00:41:20.810]  would take up more resources than actually killing an enemy soldier.
[00:41:20.810 --> 00:41:27.810]  So they created the 5-5-6 or 2-2-3, that high-velocity but tends to wound,
[00:41:27.810 --> 00:41:30.810]  not kill as often, but shatter bones.
[00:41:30.810 --> 00:41:34.810]  The bullet disintegrates in the body, and that's why they deployed it.
[00:41:34.810 --> 00:41:37.810]  It would also hold a lot of the cartridges, carry them easier.
[00:41:37.810 --> 00:41:40.810]  It is an amazing round, but that's what's going on here.
[00:41:40.810 --> 00:41:43.810]  Klaus Schwab praises CCP for its COVID control measures.
[00:41:43.810 --> 00:41:48.810]  We're going to cover that when we return and then how it ties in everything else.
[00:41:48.810 --> 00:41:49.810]  Oh, and this.
[00:41:49.810 --> 00:41:53.810]  Netherlands euthanizing autistic and intellectually handicapped people, research finds.
[00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:57.810]  Show us Canada. It's the same unified program worldwide.
[00:41:57.810 --> 00:41:58.810]  Here we go again.
[00:41:58.810 --> 00:42:02.810]  Former CIA agent to run censorship at Facebook and Meta.
[00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:03.810]  We have video of this.
[00:42:03.810 --> 00:42:06.810]  Charity worker caught trying to sell a baby, a one-year-old baby,
[00:42:06.810 --> 00:42:12.810]  to organ harvesters for $25,000 in Ukraine.
[00:42:12.810 --> 00:42:14.810]  So much more coming up.
[00:42:14.810 --> 00:42:17.810]  California set to sign a law that kidnaps children from people
[00:42:17.810 --> 00:42:20.810]  that won't let the state cut their penises and breasts off.
[00:42:20.810 --> 00:42:21.810]  It's all coming up.
[00:42:21.810 --> 00:42:24.810]  Don't forget, InfoWars.com and ZipTheSpear, Band.Video.
[00:42:24.810 --> 00:42:27.810]  But those URLs are hard to share sometimes, and they're blocked,
[00:42:27.810 --> 00:42:28.810]  so you have to do it by word of mouth.
[00:42:28.810 --> 00:42:29.810]  So share Mad Max World.
[00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:34.810]  One word, MadMaxWorld.tv, just MadMaxWorld.tv,
[00:42:34.810 --> 00:42:37.810]  and that takes you to all the links and all the things at Band.Video,
[00:42:37.810 --> 00:42:38.810]  where not just my promoting show is,
[00:42:39.810 --> 00:42:43.810]  but all the other forbidden information is as well, at Band.Video.
[00:42:43.810 --> 00:42:47.810]  All right, we'll go to break, and we will return on the other side.
[00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:48.810]  So much more to cover.
[00:42:48.810 --> 00:42:51.810]  I hope the phone's up today as well.
[00:42:51.810 --> 00:42:53.810]  InfoWars.com is tomorrow's news today,
[00:42:53.810 --> 00:42:56.810]  but the only way the dog hunts is you release it.
[00:42:56.810 --> 00:42:58.810]  You are the resistance.
[00:43:00.810 --> 00:43:04.810]  Two of our best-selling nootropics, or brain boosters,
[00:43:04.810 --> 00:43:06.810]  are now back in stock at InfoWarsStore.com,
[00:43:06.810 --> 00:43:09.810]  and for a limited time, they're 50% off when you get them together
[00:43:09.810 --> 00:43:11.810]  or 40% off when you get them individually.
[00:43:11.810 --> 00:43:15.810]  BrainForce Plus and BrainForce Ultra, two separate formulas.
[00:43:15.810 --> 00:43:18.810]  They both give you good, clean energy without the crash.
[00:43:18.810 --> 00:43:22.810]  One is a four- to six-hour good base of clean energy,
[00:43:22.810 --> 00:43:24.810]  again, with no hangover or letdown,
[00:43:24.810 --> 00:43:27.810]  and the other is a very special proprietary formula,
[00:43:27.810 --> 00:43:29.810]  that's BrainForce Ultra, that hits really, really quick,
[00:43:29.810 --> 00:43:30.810]  and I love it.
[00:43:30.810 --> 00:43:31.810]  It wears off in two to three hours.
[00:43:31.810 --> 00:43:34.810]  So if I've got to work at night but don't want to stay up all night,
[00:43:34.810 --> 00:43:36.810]  I can take it and say, 9 o'clock at night,
[00:43:36.810 --> 00:43:39.810]  got to stay up until midnight working, doing a radio interview or something,
[00:43:39.810 --> 00:43:42.810]  and boom, writing an article or writing a book,
[00:43:42.810 --> 00:43:44.810]  and then I get two, three hours of energy,
[00:43:44.810 --> 00:43:45.810]  and then you go right to bed after it.
[00:43:45.810 --> 00:43:47.810]  BrainForce Ultra, BrainForce Plus,
[00:43:47.810 --> 00:43:50.810]  both 50% off by themselves or 40% off individually.
[00:43:50.810 --> 00:43:52.810]  A lot of people love these products.
[00:43:52.810 --> 00:43:53.810]  They've got five-star reviews,
[00:43:53.810 --> 00:43:55.810]  but if you haven't tried them, you really should.
[00:43:55.810 --> 00:43:58.810]  50% off, InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:43:58.810 --> 00:44:03.810]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on Earth,
[00:44:03.810 --> 00:44:06.810]  and they've got our children drinking that.
[00:44:06.810 --> 00:44:10.810]  This is a psychotic death cult, period, case closed,
[00:44:10.810 --> 00:44:12.810]  out to get you and your family.
[00:44:12.810 --> 00:44:14.810]  We sell the Alexa Pure Breeze,
[00:44:14.810 --> 00:44:17.810]  made by the MyPatriotSupply Ready Hour Group.
[00:44:17.810 --> 00:44:18.810]  It's been around about 15 years,
[00:44:18.810 --> 00:44:20.810]  became the biggest company in the last six.
[00:44:20.810 --> 00:44:22.810]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered
[00:44:22.810 --> 00:44:26.810]  the fancy best water filter system out there that sells for twice the price,
[00:44:26.810 --> 00:44:30.810]  and they made it as good in all the studies.
[00:44:30.810 --> 00:44:32.810]  It reduces things to non-detectable levels,
[00:44:32.810 --> 00:44:33.810]  thousands of chemicals.
[00:44:33.810 --> 00:44:35.810]  But you can go pay two or three times.
[00:44:35.810 --> 00:44:37.810]  There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[00:44:37.810 --> 00:44:41.810]  We sell the very best highest-grade water filtration system
[00:44:41.810 --> 00:44:43.810]  for half the price of the leading competitor,
[00:44:43.810 --> 00:44:46.810]  and the media says we're bad and a cult
[00:44:46.810 --> 00:44:48.810]  for telling you you should filter your water.
[00:44:48.810 --> 00:44:50.810]  You should also filter your shower water.
[00:44:50.810 --> 00:44:51.810]  That's another way you absorb this crap,
[00:44:51.810 --> 00:44:53.810]  but I'm done talking about that.
[00:44:53.810 --> 00:44:56.810]  The point is you can get the filters at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:44:56.810 --> 00:44:58.810]  They're discounted right now, finally back in stock.
[00:44:58.810 --> 00:45:01.810]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world
[00:45:01.810 --> 00:45:03.810]  that the globalists were going to move against Tucker Carlson
[00:45:03.810 --> 00:45:04.810]  and take him off the air.
[00:45:04.810 --> 00:45:05.810]  People said, no way.
[00:45:05.810 --> 00:45:07.810]  He's the most powerful thing that ever happened.
[00:45:07.810 --> 00:45:09.810]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[00:45:09.810 --> 00:45:10.810]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air
[00:45:10.810 --> 00:45:12.810]  because they believed they could control him.
[00:45:12.810 --> 00:45:13.810]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't,
[00:45:13.810 --> 00:45:15.810]  he was taken off the air.
[00:45:15.810 --> 00:45:17.810]  It's the same thing with InfoWars.
[00:45:17.810 --> 00:45:19.810]  But InfoWars is not owned by Fox
[00:45:19.810 --> 00:45:21.810]  or controlled by George Soros
[00:45:21.810 --> 00:45:23.810]  or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[00:45:23.810 --> 00:45:27.810]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[00:45:27.810 --> 00:45:29.810]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[00:45:29.810 --> 00:45:33.810]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[00:45:33.810 --> 00:45:37.810]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[00:45:37.810 --> 00:45:38.810]  So I want to thank you for your support
[00:45:38.810 --> 00:45:40.810]  and encourage viewers and listeners to understand,
[00:45:40.810 --> 00:45:43.810]  please don't take InfoWars for granted.
[00:45:43.810 --> 00:45:44.810]  We're barely hanging on.
[00:45:44.810 --> 00:45:46.810]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer,
[00:45:46.810 --> 00:45:47.810]  and your financial support
[00:45:47.810 --> 00:45:49.810]  while getting great products at the same time
[00:45:49.810 --> 00:45:50.810]  at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:45:50.810 --> 00:45:51.810]  So don't procrastinate.

[00:45:58.810 --> 00:46:00.810]  I can't get into all the incredible ingredients
[00:46:00.810 --> 00:46:01.810]  in Superfemale Vitality.
[00:46:01.810 --> 00:46:04.810]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com, read about the ingredients,
[00:46:04.810 --> 00:46:05.810]  look them up for yourself,
[00:46:05.810 --> 00:46:08.810]  and then understand this is cold-pressed herbs,
[00:46:08.810 --> 00:46:10.810]  so it has a more powerful effect to the body.
[00:46:10.810 --> 00:46:14.810]  Get yours today at InfoWarsStore.com for 50% off.
[00:46:15.810 --> 00:46:17.810]  Supermale Vitality is selling out.
[00:46:17.810 --> 00:46:20.810]  It's an incredible formula for stamina, energy, libido.
[00:46:20.810 --> 00:46:21.810]  Only a few hundred bottles left.
[00:46:21.810 --> 00:46:24.810]  But the good news is we have several thousand bottles left
[00:46:24.810 --> 00:46:26.810]  of Superfemale Vitality that's the same formula.
[00:46:26.810 --> 00:46:27.810]  It boosts men.
[00:46:27.810 --> 00:46:28.810]  It boosts women.
[00:46:28.810 --> 00:46:29.810]  It works great.
[00:46:29.810 --> 00:46:31.810]  But women like pink labels.
[00:46:31.810 --> 00:46:33.810]  Men like different color labels.
[00:46:33.810 --> 00:46:35.810]  So it works for men as well.
[00:46:35.810 --> 00:46:36.810]  It's the same formula.
[00:46:36.810 --> 00:46:38.810]  It's an incredible formula, and it funds our operation.
[00:46:38.810 --> 00:46:41.810]  And here's another important part of the overall information.
[00:46:41.810 --> 00:46:44.810]  It's 50% off for a limited time.

[00:46:51.810 --> 00:46:55.810]  Superfemale Vitality, 50% off for a limited time
[00:46:55.810 --> 00:46:57.810]  at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:46:58.300 --> 00:47:08.300]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:25.200]  Alright, I've got a ton of news on the economy, on war, on the New World Order, on the poison
[00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:26.200]  shots.
[00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:31.040]  Just insane stuff coming up next hour interspersed with your phone calls.
[00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:35.920]  I'm going to open the phones up here at the end of the segment in a moment, but let me
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:37.400]  get back to Klaus Schwab.
[00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:40.400]  You've got to read his books, you've got to watch him at his World Government Summits
[00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:41.400]  they have.
[00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:42.800]  They're called World Government Summits.
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:46.120]  You've got to read and listen to this because, I mean, it's all, you're obsolete, we're getting
[00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:50.080]  rid of you, you will eat bugs, you'll own nothing, you'll have nothing.
[00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:55.160]  It's everything we told you decades ago because we were getting the documents and the research
[00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:59.360]  and the whistleblowers from the Club of Rome, from the Bilderberg Group, from the Trilateral
[00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:00.360]  Commission.
[00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:04.640]  But we're not covering what they were doing in the dark now.
[00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:06.640]  They've launched the attack, folks.
[00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:11.160]  Again, the British and the U.S. knew that the Japanese were going to attack Pearl Harbor.
[00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:15.840]  They weren't sure exactly when, but they knew it was going to be in that week.
[00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:20.160]  They sent half the troops away and sailors away on leave, basically stood down and let
[00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:21.160]  them attack.
[00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:23.200]  Had the aircraft carriers out to sea, though, because they knew that was going to be key
[00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:24.680]  in the real fight.
[00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:28.680]  Really cold-blooded, and they didn't stage the attack, they just let it happen.
[00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:30.960]  That's been partially declassified.
[00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:33.920]  I interviewed the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Moore, before he
[00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:37.040]  died, and he said it was well known in the Navy that it was allowed to happen.
[00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:40.640]  But this is beyond that.
[00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:48.440]  And so they are actually creating the crises to bring in the total control.
[00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:51.400]  And this is a very dystopic system they're setting up.
[00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:55.440]  And they sell their minions that are in on most of the plan at the highest levels, mid-level
[00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:58.400]  really aren't, though they've figured it out now, and a lot of them are joining it
[00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:00.720]  out of pure fear.
[00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:05.200]  And others do it because they are just associated to power, and they think, well, I'll be safer
[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:09.080]  working with this, which in my research and study, you will not be.
[00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:11.520]  Plus, it's the wrong thing to do.
[00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:12.640]  Have we all gotten a little lazy?
[00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:15.000]  Is modern society decadent for a lot of people?
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:16.000]  Yeah.
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:22.080]  But go be part of charity, garden, go to church, help people, you know, and understand the
[00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:27.840]  most rich and most decadent people are proud of their decadence and just want to kill the
[00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:30.960]  most of the public so they can have the earth themselves.
[00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:33.080]  Well, it's not your earth.
[00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:37.760]  And I'm not just going to sit here and let you have it and let you run over everybody.
[00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:42.280]  They're a bunch of selfish pedophiles, and it runs from that's bad to worse.
[00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:44.320]  I mean, they get way worse than just pedophilia.
[00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:50.080]  They kill the kids a lot of them because it's all about their selfishness and about embodying
[00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:52.200]  that and embodying that as a ritual.
[00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:54.640]  And that's what these poison shots are.
[00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:56.960]  So Klaus Schwab means business.
[00:49:57.080 --> 00:50:03.480]  Klaus Schwab praises CCP for its COVID control measures.
[00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:05.280]  Before we play this clip, we'll play it back to back.
[00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:10.200]  Here he is again, two years ago, two and a half years ago, when it all was really in
[00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:11.200]  the middle of the COVID.
[00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:16.760]  He had a lot of speeches on this saying, we're going to use this to bring in control and
[00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:21.000]  to get the new carbon reset and to get people used to being locked down, this time for carbon
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:22.000]  lockdowns.
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:24.840]  And even if we don't officially have carbon lockdowns, we'll just cut off the energy until
[00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:28.080]  people can't move or travel or be prosperous.
[00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:31.640]  And then to the third world, that means death, cutting off the carbon.
[00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:35.240]  Those machines eat carbon, we put off carbon.
[00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:37.160]  And when they talk about banning carbon, they're talking about banning you.
[00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:43.120]  That's why in my film, Endgame, I tell you that they're going to ban fireplaces, charcoal,
[00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:46.200]  grills, and space ears.
[00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:51.760]  That was officially in the EU, UN policy in 2009, when I made the Obama deception.
[00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:54.560]  Two and a half hour film, go watch, it's free online.
[00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:57.160]  The Obama deception.
[00:50:57.160 --> 00:50:59.720]  The Obama deception, it's at Man.DotVideo, watch it.
[00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:04.440]  It's better today than when I made it in 2009, 14 years ago.
[00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:08.600]  And it says they will ban charcoal pizza ovens.
[00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:10.880]  I specifically say that.
[00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:11.880]  And because they said it.
[00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:12.880]  And now it's here.
[00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:15.240]  You're like, well, that's just the idiots in New York.
[00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:18.760]  I love this weird thing people do, like, I don't care if the stock market crashes, I'm
[00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:19.760]  not in the stock market.
[00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:21.240]  Everything's tied to the stock market.
[00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:22.240]  I don't care.
[00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:25.120]  I don't care if people live in Houston, Shreveport.
[00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:29.240]  I don't care if they shut off the Keystone Pipeline that costs $35 million to build
[00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:35.720]  and would create hundreds of millions of barrels every few days of oil or gasoline.
[00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:37.240]  That affects what you pay for gas.
[00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:38.240]  It's just this.
[00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:39.240]  It's crazy.
[00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:42.560]  So when I see San Francisco falling apart or New York, I don't go, oh, screw them in
[00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:45.960]  New York or screw them in Los Angeles.
[00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:46.960]  You're going to be next.
[00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:51.040]  And there's this attitude in Texas, and I love Texas, my family's been here on both
[00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:52.040]  sides since the founding of it.
[00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:53.840]  It's about as Texas as you can get.
[00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:57.280]  And I got a shotgun arrival, a four-wheel drive, and I got cows, and I know how to do
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:51:58.280]  everything.
[00:51:58.280 --> 00:52:01.680]  I know how to give them everything they need, put them a bunch of their ass.
[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:06.720]  But the point is, is that the average Texas, don't ever get us, Texas is that close to
[00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:07.720]  going down.
[00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:12.480]  Florida discovered it was going down and fought back, and it's gained a little ground.
[00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:16.960]  In a football game at halftime, they're only a field goal ahead.
[00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:18.400]  Texas is behind.
[00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:19.400]  But I'm ranting.
[00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:20.400]  You know, I'll do this.
[00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:25.520]  I'm going to start the next hour and play these Klaus Schwab clips, and then I'm going
[00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:29.040]  to open the phones up and take your calls and roll the rest of it.
[00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:32.480]  But it's just incredible that they're just killing us with these poison shots, sending
[00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:36.160]  out lots to conservative and Christian areas, areas they don't control to kill higher numbers
[00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:39.720]  of people, but still killing some of theirs, so it's not as easy to notice.
[00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:42.640]  I mean, that is so incredible.
[00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:43.960]  What are we going to do about that?
[00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:48.040]  Now, I want to play a two-and-a-half-minute clip from Sunday night with this incredible
[00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:53.560]  lady, Octavia Wilder, who has worked with some of the biggest names out there but decided
[00:52:53.560 --> 00:52:58.800]  to leave the whole Hollywood system and be part of the River Church there in Tampa.
[00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:02.600]  She's a top, top vocalist, operatic singer.
[00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:05.480]  I mean, I've never seen anything like it in person.
[00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:09.280]  I want to go out and start St. Bengal Branner in this hour, and then I've got some other
[00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:14.480]  amazing singers like Raymond Silleris, and we're going to be playing some of that coming
[00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:15.480]  up as well.
[00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:18.880]  There's the proud-to-be-American and more, because these were just so powerful, and I
[00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:21.000]  got to sit right there, feet away, and hear it.
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:22.000]  That's coming up.
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:26.160]  But before we end this segment, I want to thank the listeners for support.
[00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:29.860]  If you bought as much product as you bought yesterday, every day, we wouldn't just stay
[00:53:29.860 --> 00:53:30.860]  on air.
[00:53:30.860 --> 00:53:34.520]  We'd be able to hire 10 reporters or anchors and just do things that are incredible and
[00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:36.760]  change the world even better.
[00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:41.560]  So if you'll just make purchases for a couple weeks at the level you did yesterday, we will
[00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:45.600]  be out of the $500,000 hole we're in, and then we've got a new product coming in, some
[00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:47.520]  other stuff I believe will be stabilized soon.
[00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:48.920]  Plus, you need these products.
[00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:49.920]  They're really great.
[00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:53.480]  So we have the 4th of July Super Sale going right now through the 4th of July, and then
[00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:54.840]  it'll have to end.
[00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:56.160]  And Nitric Boost is discounted.
[00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:57.160]  So good for your blood.
[00:53:57.160 --> 00:53:58.160]  So good to purify things.
[00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:01.600]  So good to go after all the spikes and all the chemicals and all the things that are in
[00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:02.600]  our environment.
[00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:05.200]  That's what Dr. Mikovits and others say everybody should be taking.
[00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:08.520]  She specifically, without me asking, said it's an incredible formula, one of the best she's
[00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:09.520]  seen.
[00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:10.520]  There's other ones out there that do the same thing.
[00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:11.520]  Just whatever you do, get them.
[00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:13.680]  Get them at infowarstore.com.
[00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:15.720]  That is the Nitric Boost.
[00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:21.000]  And then we also have the Krill Oil, the Fish Oil, that are comparable.
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:22.000]  And that's not the word I'm looking for.
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:23.000]  They're not even comparable.
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:24.000]  They are...
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:25.000]  They help it.
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:26.000]  That's the word I'm looking for.
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:27.000]  They complement it.
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:28.000]  That's it.
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:29.000]  It boosts the boost.
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:32.240]  They don't do the same thing, but they boost the boost.

[00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:17.600]  next hour.
[00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:45.720]  Oh, say, can you see by the dawn's early light, what so proudly we hailed at the twilight's
[00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:57.720]  proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming, whose
[00:55:57.720 --> 00:56:09.720]  broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight
[00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:21.720]  o'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming?
[00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:33.720]  And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
[00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:49.720]  gave proof through the night that our flag was still there.
[00:56:49.720 --> 00:57:06.720]  Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
[00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:30.720]  o'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?
[00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:32.720]  Woo!
[00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:39.720]  Live from Tampa, the River Church, Rodney Howard Brown.
[00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:41.720]  Amazing.
[00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:53.720]  Two amazing nootropics, that means brain power, are back in stock

[00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:46.720]  The answer to 1984 is 1776, and the answer for energy is BrainForce.
[00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:51.720]  How many times have you ever spoken to your son about his
[00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:53.720]  overseas business dealings?
[00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:55.720]  I've never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.
[00:58:56.720 --> 00:58:57.720]  So let me get this straight.
[00:58:57.720 --> 00:59:00.720]  The FBI was withholding from congressional oversight a document
[00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:03.720]  showing that during the Obama administration, Biden accepted a
[00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:06.720]  $10 million bribe through his son, Hunter, to force the firing
[00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:09.720]  of a Ukrainian prosecutor that was investigating corruption,
[00:59:09.720 --> 00:59:12.720]  an event that Donald Trump looked into, sparking the first
[00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:15.720]  impeachment, enforcing the arming of Ukraine, in turn setting
[00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:17.720]  the stage for the current war against Russia.
[00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:20.720]  Evidence of the bribe was also in Hunter Biden's laptop, which
[00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:24.720]  the FBI also had, but that they swore was Russian disinformation
[00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:27.720]  and infiltrated social media to censor during the 2020 campaign,
[00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:31.720]  all while the FBI investigates Trump for having classified documents
[00:59:31.720 --> 00:59:34.720]  despite the FBI admittedly letting Hillary Clinton off for a
[00:59:34.720 --> 00:59:37.720]  similar charge in 2016 when they were simultaneously launching
[00:59:37.720 --> 00:59:40.720]  the Russiagate investigation into Donald Trump using falsified
[00:59:40.720 --> 00:59:43.720]  evidence provided by the Clinton campaign.
[00:59:43.720 --> 00:59:45.720]  Do I have that all straight?
[00:59:45.720 --> 00:59:56.720]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:09.720]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say,
[01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:12.720]  I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you
[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:15.720]  want to fight. You better believe you got one.
[01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:23.720]  After seven years of violent revolution, our American founders
[01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:27.720]  were well aware that political factions were most often used
[01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:31.720]  to divide and conquer the people, and they knew that the republic
[01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:35.720]  they created would only last as long as the people could remain
[01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:40.720]  educated. In 1816, Thomas Jefferson wrote, if a nation expects
[01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:45.720]  to be ignorant and free in a state of civilization, it expects
[01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:50.720]  what never was and never will be. By the end of the Civil War,
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:55.720]  the two-party system became the norm. The globalist system we face
[01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:59.720]  today was born, and the deliberate dumbing down of the American
[01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:03.720]  citizen began with our great-great-grandparents.
[01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:08.720]  In the late 1800s, the Skinner-Pavlovian method was brought
[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:14.720]  into American schools by Johns Hopkins. These psychological methods
[01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:18.720]  allowed teachers the ability to program students' behavior in the
[01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:24.720]  same way that Pavlov did with dogs. In 1934, the Carnegie
[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:28.720]  International Endowment for Peace published the Report on the
[01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:32.720]  Commission on Social Studies, which explicitly stated the goal
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:37.720]  of eventually taking away people's land and noted that most people
[01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:41.720]  would obviously oppose this. The solution was to begin using
[01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:45.720]  the school system to recondition the minds of children.
[01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:51.720]  In 1976, the bicentennial year of the Declaration of Independence,
[01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:56.720]  124 congressmen signed the Declaration of Interdependence,
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:02:01.720]  which stated that two centuries ago, our forefathers brought forth
[01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:05.720]  a new nation. Now we must join with others to bring forth
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:11.720]  a new world order. And it pledged to give children special attention
[01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:15.720]  in distributing a common education to suit their goals.
[01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:21.720]  By the 1990s, this globalist dumbing down system was perfected,
[01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:25.720]  and America began exporting it worldwide in what is known as
[01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:32.720]  outcome-based education. Starting in 2010, Common Core began
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:36.720]  in the United States. It outlined what students were expected
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:40.720]  to know at each grade level and enforced ways to assess
[01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:45.720]  those standards. Charlotte Isserby, author of
[01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:49.720]  The Deliberate Dumbing Down of America, has traced most of this agenda
[01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:53.720]  stemming from the Order of Skull and Bones at Yale,
[01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:58.720]  through both Republicans and Democrats, two wings of the same
[01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:03.720]  globalist bird, which understood that dumbed-down people
[01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:07.720]  have a base desire for a simple dualistic choice.
[01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:13.720]  In 1953, the Rockefeller Foundation funded the Robber's Cave Experiment,
[01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:17.720]  wherein 11-year-old boys, who thought they were signing up
[01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:21.720]  for summer camp, were organized into two separate tribes
[01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:25.720]  and were manipulated into fighting each other, which was easily accomplished
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:29.720]  by having a single resource that the two groups competed for.
[01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:34.720]  The Henry Toshville experiments of the 1970s showed that by simply
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:38.720]  dividing people into two groups, they would naturally identify
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:42.720]  with their own group and discriminate against the other.
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:46.720]  The basic ego mind is constantly making preferences.
[01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:50.720]  No matter how dumb you are, you have an opinion about everything.
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:54.720]  And if you can keep the population dumb enough and give them
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:59.720]  two parties to choose from, they will innately identify with one
[01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:01.720]  and despise the other.
[01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:05.720]  This allows the globalist system the cover they need to implement
[01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:10.720]  unpopular policies, such as a central bank digital currency,
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:14.720]  while we, the people, ignorantly fight each other.
[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:17.720]  United we stand, divided we fall.
[01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:21.720]  And we've been falling for it for generations.
[01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:24.720]  The American people have been so thoroughly dumbed down
[01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:28.720]  that we think freedom is the ability to choose between two parties
[01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:31.720]  working for the same control system.
[01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:35.720]  And we have been made so weak that we are afraid to even discuss
[01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:40.720]  the option of violence, which is most often the only remedy for tyranny.
[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:45.720]  But if we were an enlightened people, we could simply unite together as one
[01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:48.720]  and just say no to the tyrants.
[01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:54.720]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:58.720]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:01.720]  InfoWars is a one-of-a-kind operation.
[01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:05.720]  And so please go to InfoWars.org and just make a donation.
[01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:07.720]  And you can make it one time or recurring.
[01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:10.720]  You have a little profile there, cancelling time.
[01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:14.720]  Every 15 days, every month, every three months, every six months,
[01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:18.720]  every nine months, you can go in and every month or every week,
[01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:20.720]  whenever you want, you program it, you just click it,
[01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:22.720]  and then you decide when you want to make a donation.
[01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:23.720]  So please do that as well.
[01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:26.720]  That way we get 95% of it after credit card fees
[01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:29.720]  instead of making 20%, 30%, 40% like we do on the products.
[01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:30.720]  But these really are amazing products.
[01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:32.720]  The big July 4 sale is going on right now.
[01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:35.720]  This is such a critical platform in the fight against the New World Order.
[01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:37.720]  The enemies out in the open were vindicated.
[01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:38.720]  People are listening more than ever.
[01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:41.720]  But in this major recession going into depression,
[01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:43.720]  and with supply chain breakdowns, I know it's hard.
[01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:44.720]  I know times are tough.
[01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:46.720]  So thank you for your support.
[01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:49.720]  But whatever you do, pray for the broadcast and share the articles and the videos.
[01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:51.720]  That you can do for free.
[01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:53.720]  And that's just as important as keeping us on air.
[01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:56.720]  So however God leads you in your heart to support us, please support us now.
[01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:58.720]  And I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
[01:05:58.720 --> 01:05:59.720]  God bless you.
[01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:14.720]  Defending the republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:16.720]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:22.720]  Alright, at this hour into the next,
[01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:25.720]  I want to open the phones up and talk to the listeners
[01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:27.720]  and get your take on all the news we've covered.
[01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:29.720]  So it's going to be first-time callers, long-time callers.
[01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:31.720]  We're not screening your calls.
[01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:32.720]  Just have a clean phone line.
[01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:33.720]  Make your point.
[01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:35.720]  We'll move the next person that way.
[01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:36.720]  We get to hear the great things you have to say.
[01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:40.720]  Informative, the interesting, the ridiculous, the thought-provoking.
[01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:42.720]  And we get to move the next person to hear them.
[01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:49.720]  But I ask you to at least comment on government studies out of the EU
[01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:52.720]  confirming that they were giving most people placebo,
[01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:55.720]  others a mild dose of the death shot,
[01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:56.720]  and others a strong injection.
[01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:58.720]  Many of them died.
[01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:01.720]  I mean, I can't believe I'm just calmly talking about this.
[01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:03.720]  We've known this for years.
[01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:07.720]  I played a Gregory's report from 17, 18, no, 19 months ago.
[01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:10.720]  And his report has links to all the documents
[01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:12.720]  and all the groups here in the U.S. with the numbers.
[01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:15.720]  I mean, these people are just monsters, man.
[01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:18.720]  But again, the public cannot believe they're being hit by something like this.
[01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:20.720]  So I mentioned this.
[01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:22.720]  I'm going to play these cloche swab clips.
[01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:26.720]  One is new, in praising the CCP, that's the Communist Party of China,
[01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:29.720]  who are the greatest mass murderers in history.
[01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:35.720]  The CIA says they killed 80 million people in their fact book online.
[01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:38.720]  The CHICOMs go, no, actually 100 million we killed.
[01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:42.720]  So they even admit that under Mao it was 80 million,
[01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:44.720]  and then they've killed 20 million since.
[01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:47.720]  And they officially say, well, that's just a good price to pay.
[01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:50.720]  Now, by the way, if you're a new listener and haven't studied the CHICOMs,
[01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:52.720]  go look that up.
[01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:54.720]  The Chinese communists say they killed 100 million.
[01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:58.720]  CIA says 84 million.
[01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:01.720]  It's just like if I say I've got a Madeleine Albright clip on 60 Minutes
[01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:05.720]  where they say, well, you tripled the sanctions on Iraq of what the Bushes had,
[01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:09.720]  Bush Sr., and it killed 2 million people, 500,000 of them children.
[01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:11.720]  Was that a good price to pay?
[01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:13.720]  She says, yeah, I killed 500,000 again.
[01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:15.720]  It's a good thing I did.
[01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:17.720]  Wouldn't give them penicillin.
[01:08:16.660 --> 01:08:23.500]  And they were a one crop economy, oil in that country, they couldn't, they produced some
[01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:24.500]  food.
[01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:25.500]  That was it.
[01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:28.139]  How about, how about you for five, six, seven years?
[01:08:28.139 --> 01:08:29.700]  You don't get any medicine.
[01:08:29.700 --> 01:08:31.080]  You don't get fuel.
[01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:32.080]  You don't get energy.
[01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:37.380]  Sit there and watch your four-year-old get a cold, their immune system's already run
[01:08:37.380 --> 01:08:39.260]  down because they've been on antibiotics before.
[01:08:39.260 --> 01:08:40.580]  Now they die in your arms.
[01:08:40.580 --> 01:08:42.780]  Madeleine Albright's a big, fat, ugly woman.
[01:08:42.780 --> 01:08:46.620]  They're like, well, she's a big, fat, ugly woman, but it's all right, I was a big, fat,
[01:08:46.620 --> 01:08:47.620]  ugly woman.
[01:08:47.620 --> 01:08:52.860]  As long as it's not a man, big old fat, disgusting little conehead, like a monkey.
[01:08:52.860 --> 01:08:57.099]  We got to celebrate though, because she's a woman.
[01:08:57.099 --> 01:08:59.660]  Disgusting murderer, burn in hell.
[01:08:59.660 --> 01:09:00.660]  Cowardly filth.
[01:09:00.660 --> 01:09:09.820]  We were at Bilderberg, it was 2000, 2018 or something, I forget it, Chantilly, Virginia.
[01:09:09.820 --> 01:09:13.860]  And I had gone to get something to eat, it was like getting dark, and they had troops
[01:09:13.860 --> 01:09:14.860]  all around everywhere.
[01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:18.099]  The news was saying it doesn't exist, Jones is insane, the New York Times.
[01:09:18.099 --> 01:09:23.580]  Jones is insane, running around in Virginia outside a hotel, claiming there's a new world
[01:09:23.580 --> 01:09:24.580]  order.
[01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:32.059]  Jones is reporting imaginary men in black and helicopters, they had marines there and
[01:09:32.059 --> 01:09:33.059]  helicopters and everything else.
[01:09:33.059 --> 01:09:34.380]  We have video of it.
[01:09:34.380 --> 01:09:38.139]  I stayed in there until it opened, and the king of Spain comes in, they play the national
[01:09:38.139 --> 01:09:39.139]  anthem.
[01:09:39.139 --> 01:09:40.139]  I have all this on video.
[01:09:40.139 --> 01:09:42.740]  And the New York Times says it doesn't exist.
[01:09:42.740 --> 01:09:45.860]  A little bit different when they met last month, all over the news, yes, the world leaders
[01:09:45.860 --> 01:09:48.420]  are meeting, secretly decide how to save you.
[01:09:48.420 --> 01:09:49.580]  Bilderberg, of course, is real.
[01:09:49.580 --> 01:09:56.340]  But Madeleine Albright pulled up in front of my crew, and when she took the wrong turn
[01:09:56.340 --> 01:10:00.380]  and drove up to peaceful protesters and just people with cameras, she literally started
[01:10:00.380 --> 01:10:06.500]  crying and drove out the other way and reportedly never came back.
[01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:10.420]  She's driving a little Mercedes convertible.
[01:10:10.420 --> 01:10:15.059]  She's out having fun, mass murdering, pulls in and sees some cameras and people, and literally
[01:10:15.059 --> 01:10:16.059]  craps a brick.
[01:10:16.059 --> 01:10:22.300]  It's all right, because she's a woman, she wears a skirt, murder them, murder me, liberal
[01:10:22.300 --> 01:10:23.300]  woman.
[01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:30.380]  She's so powerful, it's like when Hillary says, I came, I saw, he died.
[01:10:30.380 --> 01:10:33.500]  That woman can't wipe her ugly, fork-covered butt.
[01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:38.680]  She can sure as hell give you orders to kill your ass.
[01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:41.680]  While Obama's in bed with Big Mike,
[01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:44.680]  he says he's really good at killing people.
[01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:46.680]  Remember, he said that.
[01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:49.680]  In fact, get the Marilyn Albright clip ready, find it,
[01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:51.680]  and then get Obama, he said it a couple times,
[01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:54.680]  saying, I'm really good at killing people.
[01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:57.680]  He goes, Predator drones.
[01:10:57.680 --> 01:10:59.680]  He said both, I'm really good at killing people,
[01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:02.680]  and two words, Predator drones.
[01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:05.680]  And then maybe get the George W. Bush joke,
[01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:06.680]  where he's at the National Press Club,
[01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:09.680]  and he goes, nope, no WNDs here, none are there,
[01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:11.680]  they're all lying, you just killed all these more people,
[01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:13.680]  but it's all right, you're laughing about it,
[01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:17.680]  you're George W. Bush, boy, you can do whatever you want.
[01:11:19.010 --> 01:11:25.010]  They just think we're here to be killed, we're here to be run over, we're here to be
[01:11:25.010 --> 01:11:26.010]  pissed on.
[01:11:26.010 --> 01:11:28.010]  I tell you, we're not.
[01:11:28.030 --> 01:11:32.830]  Let's go ahead and play this clip.
[01:11:32.830 --> 01:11:39.670]  This is Klaus Schwab, and remember, it's not the COVID that killed millions.
[01:11:39.670 --> 01:11:43.190]  It's not the COVID that starved 30-something million to death in the last three and a half
[01:11:43.190 --> 01:11:44.389]  years with the lockdowns.
[01:11:44.389 --> 01:11:45.950]  It was the lockdowns.
[01:11:45.950 --> 01:11:49.730]  And they did it using this, and like they say, oh, global warming is the reason the
[01:11:49.730 --> 01:11:50.730]  border collapsed.
[01:11:50.730 --> 01:11:55.469]  No, you ordered it to stand down, and you told the illegals to come here, and you incentivized
[01:11:55.469 --> 01:12:00.870]  them to come here by shutting off where they work and where they live.
[01:12:00.870 --> 01:12:02.309]  And then John Kerry goes, we're being flooded.
[01:12:02.309 --> 01:12:03.309]  You see?
[01:12:03.309 --> 01:12:04.309]  It's global warming.
[01:12:04.309 --> 01:12:05.309]  No, it's your policies, you monster.
[01:12:05.309 --> 01:12:06.309]  John Kerry gives a speech now.
[01:12:06.309 --> 01:12:07.309]  He's like a bug.
[01:12:07.309 --> 01:12:08.309]  All right.
[01:12:08.309 --> 01:12:09.309]  Here's Klaus Schwab.
[01:12:09.309 --> 01:12:10.309]  Klaus Schwab.
[01:12:10.309 --> 01:12:11.309]  Klaus Schwab.
[01:12:11.309 --> 01:12:12.309]  Klaus Schwab.
[01:12:12.309 --> 01:12:13.309]  Klaus Schwab.
[01:12:13.309 --> 01:12:14.309]  Klaus Schwab.
[01:12:14.309 --> 01:12:15.309]  Klaus Schwab.
[01:12:15.309 --> 01:12:16.309]  Klaus Schwab.
[01:12:16.309 --> 01:12:17.309]  Klaus Schwab.
[01:12:17.309 --> 01:12:18.309]  Klaus Schwab.
[01:12:18.309 --> 01:12:19.309]  Klaus Schwab.
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:23.640]  History is truly at a turning point.
[01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:31.640]  Global energy systems, food systems, and supply chains will be deeply affected.
[01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:37.640]  In times of crisis, the role of governments is more important.
[01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:43.640]  Just imagine what you're hearing. This is two and a half years ago, in the heights of lockdown.
[01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:45.640]  This is three years ago, excuse me.
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:49.640]  And he's like, there will be a deep effect.
[01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:55.640]  And then later they put out little videos. Remember saying, oh, it was good, the animals were happy, humans weren't out there, there wasn't the sound of cars.
[01:12:56.640 --> 01:13:02.640]  While the whole infrastructure got set back decades, like taking a rug and pulling it out from under somebody.
[01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:07.640]  He later said this is very good to disrupt. Mass death, mass starvation.
[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:10.640]  This is your little friend. Sorry, go back to him.
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:15.640]  History is truly at a turning point.
[01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:22.640]  Global energy systems, food systems, and supply chains will be deeply affected.
[01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:30.640]  In times of crisis, the role of governments is more important and more relevant than ever.
[01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:41.640]  The profound challenges to mankind, such as climate change, are globally interconnected and require collaborative responses.
[01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:54.640]  Premier Li is the ex-premier of the People's Republic of China and a member of the Chinese Communist Party's Central Committee Politburo Standing Committee.
[01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:58.640]  Hit pause again. Back it up to the start of clip two.
[01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:00.640]  He's about to have an orgasm.
[01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:03.640]  The number two in the party.
[01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:06.640]  He has a bust of Lenin in his office.
[01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:10.640]  So I just told you we're collapsing everything we're going to pose as the saviors.
[01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:13.640]  Now he's Premier Li.
[01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:17.640]  Communism, the power we have.
[01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:23.640]  I mean, you're seeing a real Bond villain that people like Dr. Evil are based on this.
[01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:25.640]  It's not like he's trying to look like a Bond villain.
[01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:28.640]  This is the actual group that Ian Fleming based him on.
[01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:31.640]  This is what Klaus Schwab's dad and grandfather look like.
[01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:33.640]  They're making flamethrowers for Hitler.
[01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:35.640]  Go back to him.
[01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:48.640]  Premier Li is the ex-premier of the People's Republic of China and a member of the Chinese Communist Party's Central Committee Politburo Standing Committee.
[01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:55.640]  Premier Li has a distinguished career in public service,
[01:14:56.640 --> 01:15:04.640]  having led the economic and social development of three major provinces,
[01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:09.640]  Zhejiang, Yangtze and Shanghai.
[01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:17.640]  He has also been instrumental in opening up China's capital market
[01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:21.640]  attracting foreign investment and innovation
[01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:29.640]  and creating new urban areas to address land scarcity.
[01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:36.640]  Premier Li took his office this March at China's National People's Congress
[01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:43.640]  at the critical moment when China adopted new COVID control measures
[01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:53.640]  and started to boost economic development, social dynamism and international cooperation.
[01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:57.640]  Truly disgusting.
[01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:05.640]  Again, the Chai Khams in their own words have killed over 100 million of their own people.
[01:16:07.150 --> 01:16:12.150]  And Klaus Schwab says they are the model of the world.
[01:16:12.150 --> 01:16:21.150]  So does his mini-me, Jabal Noah Harari, and his other mini-me, Justin Trudeau.
[01:16:21.150 --> 01:16:24.150]  He penetrates the cabinet.
[01:16:24.150 --> 01:16:30.150]  You know, a lot of new clips that are old clips are resurfering on the web,
[01:16:30.150 --> 01:16:35.150]  and I really want to thank the viewers and listeners that are taking clips out of the shows
[01:16:35.150 --> 01:16:40.150]  and posting them on Twitter, Instagram, but also Rumble and Gab and everywhere else.
[01:16:40.150 --> 01:16:44.150]  And on YouTube, as long as you don't put my name in it, you don't have any bigger problems.
[01:16:44.150 --> 01:16:48.150]  We're reaching tens of millions of people a day because of you and with the truth.
[01:16:48.150 --> 01:16:51.150]  And it's the old clips that are really the most important.
[01:16:51.150 --> 01:16:56.150]  I saw this clip two days ago on InfoWars.com, and I thought, wow, that's a really important clip.
[01:16:56.150 --> 01:16:59.150]  It shows I'm going off their own documents, that I had their battle plan,
[01:16:59.150 --> 01:17:03.150]  that this is real, and that I'm going to tell you what's coming next off their own battle plan.
[01:17:03.150 --> 01:17:05.150]  You can go read it for yourself and know how to beat them.
[01:17:05.150 --> 01:17:09.150]  But people, they listen to me now because they've seen what I've talked about come true,
[01:17:09.150 --> 01:17:13.150]  but they really listen to the old clips.
[01:17:13.150 --> 01:17:18.150]  And so we played this yesterday, and it's since gone viral, got over a million views.
[01:17:18.150 --> 01:17:22.150]  And I thought we'd play it again just to encourage others to keep uploading this
[01:17:22.150 --> 01:17:25.150]  because, again, it's only a minute and a half clip, and it just says it all.
[01:17:25.150 --> 01:17:27.150]  Here it is.
[01:17:27.150 --> 01:17:33.150]  And right before the break, I was reading some of those quotes by Attenborough and others coming out
[01:17:33.150 --> 01:17:38.150]  saying it's time to basically wipe out the third world.
[01:17:38.150 --> 01:17:46.150]  And notice this is normally from liberal academics and naturalists who say they're for multiculturalism
[01:17:46.150 --> 01:17:51.150]  and get rid of the family and teach homosexuality and all this
[01:17:51.150 --> 01:17:56.150]  just so people don't have any unifying culture left
[01:17:56.150 --> 01:17:59.150]  and so that it's not cool to have children.
[01:17:59.150 --> 01:18:02.150]  It's literally ultimate greed.
[01:18:02.150 --> 01:18:06.150]  They're attacking the West that they see as their main challenge, number one,
[01:18:06.150 --> 01:18:09.150]  while attacking the third world just out of hand
[01:18:09.150 --> 01:18:14.150]  because there's no media complex or government complex or cultural complex in the third world
[01:18:14.150 --> 01:18:17.150]  that can organize against this.
[01:18:17.150 --> 01:18:22.150]  But David Attenborough has come out and stated what is in all their publications.
[01:18:22.150 --> 01:18:27.150]  They're on record hitting us with psychotronic wavelength weapon systems.
[01:18:27.150 --> 01:18:36.150]  They're on record designing all the GMO with recombinant RNA and DNA weapon systems.
[01:18:36.150 --> 01:18:39.150]  Really, it's nanotech but genetically based.
[01:18:39.150 --> 01:18:44.150]  They are hitting us all with hundreds of chemicals in the water supply
[01:18:44.150 --> 01:18:48.150]  with hydrofluorosilicic acid as the boosting adjuvant.
[01:18:48.150 --> 01:18:50.150]  This is all on record.
[01:18:50.150 --> 01:18:53.150]  Silent weapons for quiet wars, Pentagon documents.
[01:18:53.150 --> 01:18:56.150]  I'm giving you the names right now.
[01:18:56.150 --> 01:19:02.150]  Soft kill prospectus 1968, MIT, Stanford Research Institute.
[01:19:02.150 --> 01:19:04.150]  I mean I'm giving it all to you right now.
[01:19:04.150 --> 01:19:06.150]  Anybody that wants to go find out about this.
[01:19:06.150 --> 01:19:13.150]  And the insane part is the Pentagon, the CIA people, 99.9% of them are compartmentalized
[01:19:13.150 --> 01:19:16.150]  and are all being attacked by this as well.
[01:19:16.150 --> 01:19:18.150]  There will be no winners in this.
[01:19:18.150 --> 01:19:20.150]  They're going to kill everybody.
[01:19:20.150 --> 01:19:25.150]  And right now you just see them trying to shut down the final sovereign nations,
[01:19:25.150 --> 01:19:30.150]  trying to develop their super weapons, their nanotech, putting it in place,
[01:19:30.150 --> 01:19:37.150]  trying to set up their new takeover system of the internet that was always designed for this reason.
[01:19:37.150 --> 01:19:40.150]  So that's the big picture.
[01:19:41.220 --> 01:19:45.220]  No one's safe, no one's going to escape this, they're going to kill everybody.
[01:19:45.220 --> 01:19:49.220]  And they now say that, Naval Harari, Ray Kurzweil, they say,
[01:19:49.220 --> 01:19:52.220]  humans won't be around soon, it's the time of humans is coming to an end.
[01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:54.220]  They've really bought into this spirit, this thing,
[01:19:54.220 --> 01:19:56.220]  saying they're going to merge the machines and become gods.
[01:19:56.220 --> 01:20:00.220]  And remember, it's now two years ago, we should find it again.
[01:20:00.220 --> 01:20:04.220]  William Shatner goes up in Blue Origin or whatever,
[01:20:04.220 --> 01:20:08.220]  I don't know, Blue Origin is what the Virgin guy calls it,
[01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:12.220]  whatever the space company of Bezos is,
[01:20:12.220 --> 01:20:16.220]  and he goes up there in this pod, this capsule,
[01:20:16.220 --> 01:20:20.220]  and he looks down, he lands, he goes,
[01:20:20.220 --> 01:20:24.220]  I was up there just looking at the cataclysm that's about to happen,
[01:20:24.220 --> 01:20:28.220]  this was during the COVID lockdowns.
[01:20:28.220 --> 01:20:32.220]  Now almost everybody's got to die for the Earth,
[01:20:32.220 --> 01:20:34.220]  and I just thought it's so sad they're all going to die.
[01:20:34.220 --> 01:20:36.220]  Everyone will be dead soon.
[01:20:36.220 --> 01:20:38.220]  They're like, Mr. Shatner, please come over here.
[01:20:38.220 --> 01:20:42.220]  Because he's been read in.
[01:20:42.220 --> 01:20:46.220]  And I said that a long time ago, I know people that know Shatner,
[01:20:46.220 --> 01:20:50.220]  he's a really nice guy, and he almost came on the show.
[01:20:50.220 --> 01:20:52.220]  I like William Shatner, what a character.
[01:20:52.220 --> 01:20:56.220]  He's just like, transhumanism, I want to live forever,
[01:20:56.220 --> 01:20:58.220]  I go to the conferences and I meet with the globalists,
[01:20:58.220 --> 01:21:02.220]  they tell me how it all works, and I just want to live.
[01:21:02.220 --> 01:21:04.220]  They told me everybody's about to die.
[01:21:04.220 --> 01:21:06.220]  Well, I'm not supposed to talk about that.
[01:21:06.220 --> 01:21:08.220]  Well, you're all about to be dead.
[01:21:07.810 --> 01:21:10.810]  So they found the club.
[01:21:11.770 --> 01:21:18.170]  The crew is so great.
[01:21:18.170 --> 01:21:20.570]  I asked for so much stuff.
[01:21:20.570 --> 01:21:21.570]  There's another clip I want to play.
[01:21:21.570 --> 01:21:22.570]  What was the clip I asked for?
[01:21:22.570 --> 01:21:23.570]  You guys combined two clips.
[01:21:23.570 --> 01:21:24.570]  What was it?
[01:21:24.570 --> 01:21:25.570]  The Obama bragging about, I came, I saw they die.
[01:21:25.570 --> 01:21:26.570]  I used drones, Hillary.
[01:21:26.570 --> 01:21:27.570]  I came, I saw they died.
[01:21:27.570 --> 01:21:28.570]  And then we've got, of course, Mel.
[01:21:28.570 --> 01:21:29.570]  All right.
[01:21:29.570 --> 01:21:30.570]  Well, you killed 500,000 children knowingly.
[01:21:30.570 --> 01:21:46.810]  We're not giving him penicillin and no medical supplies for at least the last seven or eight
[01:21:46.810 --> 01:21:47.810]  years of administration.
[01:21:47.810 --> 01:21:48.810]  He goes, yeah, that's good.
[01:21:48.810 --> 01:21:49.810]  I'll do it again.
[01:21:49.810 --> 01:21:50.810]  I'm a big fat ugly woman.
[01:21:50.810 --> 01:21:54.950]  I get to murder you.
[01:21:54.950 --> 01:21:57.530]  I get to murder you.
[01:21:57.530 --> 01:22:04.890]  so incredibly liberal and because she looks like one of those goblins from uh harry potter it's
[01:22:04.890 --> 01:22:10.090]  okay like well you look like a goblin we gotta let you kill us what was incredible even it even
[01:22:10.090 --> 01:22:14.970]  came out on when she was on 60 minutes not just her saying you know it's a good price to pay to
[01:22:14.970 --> 01:22:21.130]  kill everybody behind her was a famous stolen painting that the nazis stole and they killed
[01:22:21.130 --> 01:22:26.330]  the jew that painted it and of course her father especially was like he was like way above uh
[01:22:27.530 --> 01:22:32.090]  gordon soros in the level of it going around robbing fellow jews and then handing over the
[01:22:32.090 --> 01:22:36.730]  nazis but it was a famous you look this up alan albright caught with stolen painting of holocaust
[01:22:36.730 --> 01:22:41.770]  victim and and so her dad went and would would tell jews he'd get him out of the country then
[01:22:41.770 --> 01:22:45.930]  turn him over the nazis this is on record and then he ran to serbia and they saved him and
[01:22:45.930 --> 01:22:49.450]  when she launched the attack on belgrade and bombed him with du and let the muslims take
[01:22:49.450 --> 01:22:53.850]  over a third of the country and just slaughter the serbs um because it was liberal of course
[01:22:54.810 --> 01:22:58.490]  they said why are you doing this to us we saved you and she said
[01:23:01.210 --> 01:23:05.450]  i'd round my father rounded up jews and took their property i'll kill you too
[01:23:07.450 --> 01:23:09.290]  i mean just think about it's just like george soros
[01:23:10.650 --> 01:23:15.290]  which i said was the best time of my life rounding up jews i'd do it again it was it was happy making
[01:23:15.290 --> 01:23:20.090]  i was it was exhilarating i you know it's like markets i feel no guilt if i didn't do it somebody
[01:23:20.330 --> 01:23:26.250]  else would do it what would that what must that feel like to like like well if i don't just you
[01:23:26.250 --> 01:23:30.170]  know pistol whip this person and take their car and shoot him in the ditch somebody else will do it
[01:23:30.410 --> 01:23:41.650]  Total psychotic demon but they know you've got a conscious they say you better let me
[01:23:41.650 --> 01:23:46.130]  take control of your body or you're a Nazi you better let me take your bank account or
[01:23:46.130 --> 01:23:51.330]  you're Hitler and so people are now revolting saying well then you know Hitler's not bad
[01:23:51.330 --> 01:23:54.930]  no Hitler was bad too he was just a competing faction with these people.
[01:23:56.020 --> 01:23:58.020]  That's all.
[01:23:59.020 --> 01:24:02.020]  He saw predatory globalist organizations and groups in the British Empire
[01:24:02.020 --> 01:24:05.020]  and he wanted to be the predatory group so he was just another predator.
[01:24:05.470 --> 01:24:16.590]  Hitler's, I mean on a scale, the British Empire, Hitler, the ADL, George Soros, they're all
[01:24:16.590 --> 01:24:17.590]  a 10.
[01:24:17.590 --> 01:24:22.110]  As evil as you can be, they're always trying to be more ruthless, more evil, they see it
[01:24:22.110 --> 01:24:26.470]  as manly, as powerful, they have no morals to hate everyone, even their own families
[01:24:26.470 --> 01:24:35.390]  and just hate and just steal and just hurt and they're Chinese and they're Anglo and
[01:24:35.390 --> 01:24:40.790]  they're African and they're Latin American, they're every group, they're Arab.
[01:24:40.830 --> 01:24:43.830]  They're evil.
[01:24:44.840 --> 01:24:47.840]  There's evil white people, there's good white people.
[01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:49.840]  There's good Christians, there's bad Christians.
[01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:50.840]  False Christians.
[01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:52.840]  And there's good Jews and there's bad Jews.
[01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:55.840]  And there's good Nigerians and there's bad Nigerians.
[01:24:55.840 --> 01:25:02.840]  And we have to recognize that people like George Soros hide behind what they did.
[01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:05.840]  They want to intimidate us to not have the nerve to call him out.
[01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:07.840]  But we do.
[01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:09.840]  And we're never going to shut up and we're winning.
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:14.840]  And humanity together, every race, color, and creed are going to go to the stars.
[01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:18.840]  And all you people that serve evil are going to be left in the ash heap of history.
[01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:21.840]  But here's some of your little bloodthirsty globalists here.
[01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:22.840]  I mentioned a bunch of clips.
[01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:25.840]  We should probably just have a whole bloodthirsty continuum.
[01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:28.840]  I mean, there's so many clips.
[01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:30.840]  George W. Bush makes jokes about WMDs.
[01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:32.840]  No WMDs under here?
[01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:33.840]  Wait, none under there?
[01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:35.840]  I don't know what they put together, but here it is.
[01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:40.840]  We have heard that half a million children have died.
[01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:45.840]  I mean, that's more children than died in Hiroshima.
[01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:49.840]  And, you know, is the price worth it?
[01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:52.840]  I think this is a very hard choice.
[01:25:52.840 --> 01:25:55.840]  But the price, we think the price is worth it.
[01:25:57.110 --> 01:26:04.110]  We came, saw, he died.
[01:26:05.610 --> 01:26:12.110]  The Jonas Brothers are here. They're out there somewhere.
[01:26:13.610 --> 01:26:20.110]  But boys, don't get any ideas. I have two words for you. Predator drones.
[01:26:20.110 --> 01:26:27.110]  You will never see it coming.
[01:26:29.110 --> 01:26:33.110]  You think I'm joking?
[01:26:34.110 --> 01:26:37.110]  Ten minutes, it had everything. We're so happy that you're here.
[01:26:37.610 --> 01:26:44.110]  It had everything. And the realization once again, the fragility of this planet,
[01:26:44.110 --> 01:26:50.110]  the coming catastrophic event, and we all have to clean this act up now.
[01:26:50.610 --> 01:26:54.110]  Well said. I kept thinking about that saying they said when you go to space,
[01:26:54.610 --> 01:26:57.110]  they should have sent a poet to describe it. Well, they kind of did.
[01:26:57.610 --> 01:27:02.110]  Bill Shatner, thank you for your poetry. I'm glad you had so much fun.
[01:27:02.610 --> 01:27:05.110]  And he's actually going to be back in our third hour with more to share.
[01:27:06.110 --> 01:27:09.110]  And every time I ask for that, we pull up that clip.
[01:27:09.610 --> 01:27:13.110]  He was quoting the news. There's video when he gets off the pod.
[01:27:13.110 --> 01:27:17.110]  I'm so sad the catastrophic event, everybody's going to have to die,
[01:27:17.610 --> 01:27:21.110]  all those people down there. We'll find it. But good job.
[01:27:21.610 --> 01:27:26.110]  And then again, he gave interviews and books saying I'm really good at killing people.
[01:27:26.610 --> 01:27:30.110]  So it's just spectacular how disconnected from reality these folks are.
[01:27:30.610 --> 01:27:33.110]  All right. I said I'd give the number out.
[01:27:33.610 --> 01:27:42.110]  877-789-2539, 877-789-Alex, 877-789-2539.
[01:27:42.110 --> 01:27:45.110]  And maybe we'll punch up the phone system here so I can see it
[01:27:45.610 --> 01:27:49.110]  and take the calls, but 877-789-2539.
[01:27:49.610 --> 01:27:52.110]  Please don't forget we're running the biggest sale of the year so far
[01:27:52.610 --> 01:27:55.110]  and your purchases are critical to our continued operation.
[01:27:55.610 --> 01:27:59.110]  But really, that's a side issue. You really need nitric boost.
[01:27:59.610 --> 01:28:02.110]  You really need ultimate fish oil, ultimate krill oil for your heart, your brain.
[01:28:02.610 --> 01:28:04.110]  You normally need all this anyways.
[01:28:04.610 --> 01:28:08.110]  But the quality of life you get out of this, people take nitric boost
[01:28:08.110 --> 01:28:10.110]  and they have the libido of it.
[01:28:10.610 --> 01:28:12.110]  And their muscles get healthier and plumper and things.
[01:28:12.610 --> 01:28:15.110]  But when I forget to take it, I've been out of town for a week and a half,
[01:28:15.610 --> 01:28:17.110]  I'm like I forgot to bring it with me.
[01:28:17.610 --> 01:28:20.110]  I'm like I'm feeling it. Nitric boost is so incredible.
[01:28:20.610 --> 01:28:22.110]  You should all get it. It's discounted.
[01:28:22.610 --> 01:28:24.110]  The stuff's up to 60% off right now.
[01:28:24.610 --> 01:28:27.110]  The sale will end next week after July 4th.
[01:28:27.610 --> 01:28:32.110]  So again, Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:28:32.610 --> 01:28:35.110]  But I'll look at the krill oil, the fish oil and the nitric boost for your heart,
[01:28:35.110 --> 01:28:38.110]  your lungs, your brain with all the stuff that's going on right now.
[01:28:38.610 --> 01:28:40.110]  That's so critical.
[01:28:40.610 --> 01:28:43.110]  And I would also get TurboForce.
[01:28:43.610 --> 01:28:45.110]  It's selling out. It's 25% off, 10 hours of energy.
[01:28:45.610 --> 01:28:49.110]  We have BrainForce Plus and BrainForce Ultra, two different great nootropics.
[01:28:49.610 --> 01:28:54.110]  They're both 50% off, discounted right now as well.
[01:28:54.610 --> 01:28:57.110]  And we just have the great CBD, 1,000 milligram.
[01:28:57.610 --> 01:28:59.110]  And then we have the lower milligram.
[01:29:00.110 --> 01:29:04.110]  Two of our best-selling nootropics or brain boosters
[01:29:04.110 --> 01:29:07.110]  are now back in stock at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:29:07.610 --> 01:29:10.110]  And for a limited time, they're 50% off when you get them together
[01:29:10.610 --> 01:29:12.110]  or 40% off when you get them individually.
[01:29:12.610 --> 01:29:16.110]  BrainForce Plus and BrainForce Ultra, two separate formulas.
[01:29:16.610 --> 01:29:19.110]  They both give you good, clean energy without the crash.
[01:29:19.610 --> 01:29:23.110]  One is a four- to six-hour good base of clean energy,
[01:29:23.610 --> 01:29:25.110]  again, with no hangover or letdown.
[01:29:25.610 --> 01:29:28.110]  And the other is a very special proprietary formula,
[01:29:28.610 --> 01:29:30.110]  that's BrainForce Ultra, that hits really, really quick.
[01:29:30.610 --> 01:29:32.110]  And I love it. It wears off in two to three hours.
[01:29:32.110 --> 01:29:34.110]  So if I've got to work at night but don't want to stay up all night,
[01:29:34.610 --> 01:29:36.110]  I can take it and stay nine o'clock at night.
[01:29:36.610 --> 01:29:39.110]  Got to stay up till midnight working, doing a radio interview or something,
[01:29:39.610 --> 01:29:42.110]  and boom, writing an article or writing a book.
[01:29:42.610 --> 01:29:44.110]  And then I get two, three hours of energy,
[01:29:44.610 --> 01:29:45.610]  and then you go right to bed after it.
[01:29:46.110 --> 01:29:49.110]  BrainForce Ultra, BrainForce Plus, both 50% off by themselves
[01:29:49.610 --> 01:29:50.610]  or 40% off individually.
[01:29:51.110 --> 01:29:52.110]  A lot of people love these products.
[01:29:52.610 --> 01:29:53.610]  They've got five-star reviews.
[01:29:54.110 --> 01:29:55.110]  But if you haven't tried them, you really should.
[01:29:55.610 --> 01:29:58.110]  50% off, Infowarsstore.com.
[01:29:58.610 --> 01:30:00.110]  Two amazing nootropics.
[01:30:00.110 --> 01:30:02.110]  That means brain power.
[01:30:02.610 --> 01:30:04.110]  Are back in stock at Infowarsstore.com,
[01:30:04.610 --> 01:30:07.110]  and they're both 50% off.
[01:30:07.610 --> 01:30:11.110]  We haven't offered these for 50% off since last Christmas.
[01:30:11.610 --> 01:30:13.110]  These are amazing products,
[01:30:13.610 --> 01:30:15.110]  and for those of you on the fence, I want you to try them.
[01:30:15.610 --> 01:30:17.110]  BrainForce Ultra hits in 15 minutes,
[01:30:17.610 --> 01:30:20.110]  only lasts three hours with no hangover.
[01:30:20.610 --> 01:30:21.610]  It is a game changer.
[01:30:22.110 --> 01:30:23.110]  Nobody's got something close to this.
[01:30:23.610 --> 01:30:27.110]  Then our BrainForce Plus is a good, basic, clean nootropic.
[01:30:27.610 --> 01:30:29.110]  Gives you four to six hours of amazing energy.
[01:30:29.110 --> 01:30:31.110]  Again, with no hangover, no jitters.
[01:30:31.610 --> 01:30:33.110]  Both products back in stock.
[01:30:33.610 --> 01:30:37.110]  Infowarsstore.com for 50% off, and it funds the Infowar.
[01:30:37.610 --> 01:30:40.110]  So get your BrainForce Ultra, your BrainForce Plus,
[01:30:40.610 --> 01:30:44.110]  and your TurboForce all exclusively at Infowarsstore.com,
[01:30:44.610 --> 01:30:47.110]  and know you're funding the second American revolution,
[01:30:47.610 --> 01:30:49.110]  1776 worldwide.
[01:30:49.610 --> 01:30:53.110]  The answer to 1984 is 1776,
[01:30:53.610 --> 01:30:56.110]  and the answer for energy is BrainForce.
[01:30:57.110 --> 01:31:00.110]  How many times have you ever spoken to your son
[01:31:00.610 --> 01:31:02.110]  about his overseas business dealings?
[01:31:02.610 --> 01:31:05.110]  I've never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.
[01:31:05.610 --> 01:31:06.610]  So let me get this straight.
[01:31:07.110 --> 01:31:09.110]  The FBI was withholding from congressional oversight
[01:31:09.610 --> 01:31:11.110]  a document showing that during the Obama administration,
[01:31:11.610 --> 01:31:14.110]  Biden accepted a $10 million bribe through his son, Hunter,
[01:31:14.610 --> 01:31:16.110]  to force the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor
[01:31:16.610 --> 01:31:18.110]  that was investigating corruption,
[01:31:18.610 --> 01:31:20.110]  an event that Donald Trump looked into,
[01:31:20.610 --> 01:31:23.110]  sparking the first impeachment, enforcing the arming of Ukraine,
[01:31:23.110 --> 01:31:25.110]  in turn setting the stage for the current war against Russia.
[01:31:25.610 --> 01:31:28.110]  Evidence of the bribe was also in Hunter Biden's laptop,
[01:31:28.610 --> 01:31:30.110]  which the FBI also had,
[01:31:30.610 --> 01:31:32.110]  but that they swore was Russian disinformation
[01:31:32.610 --> 01:31:36.110]  and infiltrated social media to censor during the 2020 campaign,
[01:31:36.610 --> 01:31:38.110]  all while the FBI investigates Trump
[01:31:38.610 --> 01:31:40.110]  for having classified documents,
[01:31:40.610 --> 01:31:42.110]  despite the FBI admittedly letting Hillary Clinton off
[01:31:42.610 --> 01:31:44.110]  for a similar charge in 2016,
[01:31:44.610 --> 01:31:46.110]  when they were simultaneously launching
[01:31:46.610 --> 01:31:48.110]  the Russiagate investigation into Donald Trump
[01:31:48.610 --> 01:31:52.110]  using falsified evidence provided by the Clinton campaign.
[01:31:52.110 --> 01:31:54.110]  Do I have that all straight?
[01:32:22.110 --> 01:32:25.110]  Clean, healthy water, whenever you want it, wherever you want it.
[01:32:25.610 --> 01:32:27.110]  Even if the water pressure goes out,
[01:32:27.610 --> 01:32:30.110]  the gravity-fed water filter has got you covered.
[01:32:32.110 --> 01:32:36.110]  Absolutely, and we couldn't do any of this
[01:32:36.610 --> 01:32:38.110]  without listener support.
[01:32:38.610 --> 01:32:40.110]  I was telling Greg earlier, we're like the real NPR,
[01:32:40.610 --> 01:32:42.110]  the real NPR of the base, right?
[01:32:42.610 --> 01:32:45.110]  So click that QR code right there on your screen right now,
[01:32:45.610 --> 01:32:47.110]  take out your phone, click that QR code,
[01:32:47.610 --> 01:32:49.110]  it'll take you directly to InfoWarsTore.com,
[01:32:49.610 --> 01:32:51.110]  buy something, support the InfoWars,
[01:32:51.110 --> 01:32:53.110]  keep Alex Jones, Orrin Schroer, Harrison Smith,
[01:32:53.610 --> 01:32:56.110]  Greg Reese, Adam King, and the rest of us on air.
[01:32:56.610 --> 01:32:59.110]  Do it today, do it now, support the InfoWars!
[01:33:00.110 --> 01:33:04.110]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[01:33:04.610 --> 01:33:07.110]  it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:21.110 --> 01:33:23.110]  If you are receiving this transmission,
[01:33:23.610 --> 01:33:25.110]  you are the resistance.
[01:33:26.110 --> 01:33:29.110]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios,
[01:33:29.610 --> 01:33:31.110]  it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:34.110 --> 01:33:37.110]  I know, as negative as all this information is,
[01:33:37.610 --> 01:33:39.110]  it can get people down.
[01:33:39.610 --> 01:33:41.110]  Remember, God is in control.
[01:33:41.610 --> 01:33:44.110]  I told you years ago, you would see a major resistance form,
[01:33:44.610 --> 01:33:46.110]  you would see the global start really well,
[01:33:46.610 --> 01:33:48.110]  you would see the global collapse.
[01:33:48.110 --> 01:33:49.110]  You would see a major resistance form,
[01:33:49.610 --> 01:33:52.110]  you would see the global start really having big problems,
[01:33:52.610 --> 01:33:54.110]  and that they would start imploding.
[01:33:54.610 --> 01:33:55.110]  And you're seeing that.
[01:33:55.610 --> 01:33:59.110]  Evil is very confident, it's delusional, it's crazy.
[01:33:59.610 --> 01:34:01.110]  And it always goes too far.
[01:34:02.110 --> 01:34:03.110]  And it always destroys itself.
[01:34:03.610 --> 01:34:05.110]  We just have to protect ourselves,
[01:34:05.610 --> 01:34:07.110]  and not get tangled up with them,
[01:34:07.610 --> 01:34:10.110]  but also stand up for those that evil is attacking.
[01:34:10.610 --> 01:34:11.110]  So it's a tall order.
[01:34:11.610 --> 01:34:13.110]  Help the innocent, help the children,
[01:34:13.610 --> 01:34:16.110]  but at the same time, don't get tricked into all-out war with the enemy.
[01:34:17.110 --> 01:34:19.110]  We're doing that right now together,
[01:34:19.610 --> 01:34:20.110]  and it's a beautiful time to be alive.
[01:34:20.610 --> 01:34:25.110]  I want to go to OneCardMoney, Jason, Tim, John.
[01:34:26.780 --> 01:34:30.780]  Barbara, man, I bought glasses two years ago.
[01:34:30.780 --> 01:34:32.780]  I kind of needed them then, I really need them now.
[01:34:32.780 --> 01:34:34.780]  And I can't find the two pairs I bought.
[01:34:34.780 --> 01:34:36.780]  One, I found the sunglasses, but I can't find...
[01:34:36.780 --> 01:34:40.780]  I got to go to the optometrist when I get back to Austin Sunday.
[01:34:40.780 --> 01:34:42.780]  I mean, because I can't...
[01:34:42.780 --> 01:34:45.780]  My eyes used to be 20-15, man, I can't read any of this right now.
[01:34:45.780 --> 01:34:47.780]  That's part of my frustration on air, too.
[01:34:47.780 --> 01:34:49.780]  Like, I have to, like, wait, I used to be able to read this.
[01:34:49.780 --> 01:34:50.780]  Read it, you can see that.
[01:34:50.780 --> 01:34:52.780]  Trying to make it focus is crazy.
[01:34:52.780 --> 01:34:54.780]  But that's where we're at here.
[01:34:54.780 --> 01:34:57.780]  And George in Arizona.
[01:34:57.780 --> 01:34:59.780]  So, this is all coming up.
[01:34:59.780 --> 01:35:01.780]  I'm going to go crazy.
[01:35:01.780 --> 01:35:04.780]  I guess it's good, though, as you know more, you can see and hear less.
[01:35:04.780 --> 01:35:06.780]  It's like this ear is starting to go out.
[01:35:06.780 --> 01:35:10.780]  Oh, my goodness.
[01:35:10.780 --> 01:35:15.780]  So, we're going to go to your phone calls here in a moment and take those.
[01:35:15.780 --> 01:35:17.780]  And Pastor Scarlett, always a great guy.
[01:35:17.780 --> 01:35:20.780]  He's going to talk about the human smuggling and more,
[01:35:20.780 --> 01:35:24.780]  and these videos we've got of it, and his research of the border coming up.
[01:35:24.780 --> 01:35:29.780]  And we've got Roseanne Barb tomorrow in studio.
[01:35:29.780 --> 01:35:35.780]  So, I won't be in studio until Monday, but I will be here every day on air.
[01:35:35.780 --> 01:35:38.780]  But Roseanne Barb will be in studio tomorrow.
[01:35:38.780 --> 01:35:39.780]  That should be very interesting.
[01:35:39.780 --> 01:35:42.780]  Look forward to her clarifying what she really said,
[01:35:42.780 --> 01:35:45.780]  because Theo Vaughn put out a video of what she really said.
[01:35:45.780 --> 01:35:48.780]  She said, I should be able to say anything I want, like,
[01:35:48.780 --> 01:35:51.780]  well, they cut that part out.
[01:35:51.780 --> 01:35:52.780]  I think you should.
[01:35:52.780 --> 01:35:54.780]  It's like a litmus test.
[01:35:54.780 --> 01:35:55.780]  I should be able to say the N word.
[01:35:55.780 --> 01:35:56.780]  I don't want to.
[01:35:56.780 --> 01:35:58.780]  I don't like it.
[01:35:58.780 --> 01:36:04.780]  But famously in the OJ Simpson trial, his lawyers used that word to invoke emotion.
[01:36:04.780 --> 01:36:07.780]  They're trying to like ban books that have the name in it.
[01:36:07.780 --> 01:36:10.780]  The left wants to ban everything except pedophilia.
[01:36:10.780 --> 01:36:12.780]  But I want to go to your phone calls.
[01:36:12.780 --> 01:36:14.780]  Here's a really important clip I talked about yesterday,
[01:36:14.780 --> 01:36:20.780]  how I went on Piers Morgan in 2013,
[01:36:20.780 --> 01:36:24.780]  and there had just been an Indian mob of men in India
[01:36:24.780 --> 01:36:28.780]  had just mass gang-raped a bunch of women, mob psychology.
[01:36:28.780 --> 01:36:32.780]  And they'd raped some of the women with steel rods until one of them died,
[01:36:32.780 --> 01:36:35.780]  kind of like Hillary Clinton's first case.
[01:36:35.780 --> 01:36:36.780]  It was a man that raped a young girl.
[01:36:36.780 --> 01:36:39.780]  He kidnapped her with a broomstick, and she got him off of it.
[01:36:39.780 --> 01:36:41.780]  And I was saying, you don't blame the broomstick.
[01:36:41.780 --> 01:36:42.780]  You don't blame the steel rod.
[01:36:42.780 --> 01:36:44.780]  You don't blame the gun.
[01:36:44.780 --> 01:36:46.780]  You blame the person that's doing it,
[01:36:46.780 --> 01:36:49.780]  and then you want to know what's happening to their brains.
[01:36:49.780 --> 01:36:51.780]  And we know what's happening to their brains.
[01:36:51.780 --> 01:36:57.780]  On the SSRI inserts, it says it can cause mass murder.
[01:36:57.780 --> 01:36:59.780]  It can cause megalomania.
[01:36:59.780 --> 01:37:01.780]  It can cause mass shootings.
[01:37:01.780 --> 01:37:03.780]  And Kennedy brings this up, and he says, oh, in a study,
[01:37:03.780 --> 01:37:08.780]  27% increase or whatever, a 30% increase.
[01:37:08.780 --> 01:37:11.780]  Almost every mass shooter that comes out was under psychiatric care
[01:37:11.780 --> 01:37:12.780]  and on a bunch of drugs.
[01:37:12.780 --> 01:37:14.780]  It just never gets to the record because of HIPAA.
[01:37:14.780 --> 01:37:19.780]  So where people got past HIPAA, the drug was involved.
[01:37:19.780 --> 01:37:20.780]  But it's not 37%.
[01:37:20.780 --> 01:37:27.780]  It's not 40%, whether it was the lunatic Adam Lanza at Sandy Hook.
[01:37:27.780 --> 01:37:28.780]  Yeah, I didn't kill the kids.
[01:37:28.780 --> 01:37:30.780]  Everybody thinks that.
[01:37:30.780 --> 01:37:31.780]  Alex Jones, Sandy Hook.
[01:37:31.780 --> 01:37:33.780]  No, Adam Lanza was on a bunch of drugs.
[01:37:33.780 --> 01:37:35.780]  Harrison Kleibold, Columbine.
[01:37:35.780 --> 01:37:39.780]  The cruise guy in Florida at Parkland.
[01:37:39.780 --> 01:37:43.780]  The guy that attacked the movie theater in Colorado.
[01:37:43.780 --> 01:37:45.780]  I mean, they're all on this stuff.
[01:37:45.780 --> 01:37:47.780]  They're whacked out of their brains.
[01:37:47.780 --> 01:37:51.780]  A few years ago, some Asian guy with no criminal record was in a Walmart
[01:37:51.780 --> 01:37:55.780]  and just shot a cop that he got shot.
[01:37:55.780 --> 01:37:58.780]  And I said, I bet that guy was on Xanax and alcohol.
[01:37:58.780 --> 01:38:00.780]  Xanax and alcohol.
[01:38:00.780 --> 01:38:01.780]  I think you're in a video game.
[01:38:01.780 --> 01:38:04.780]  And that's why it's video game players.
[01:38:04.780 --> 01:38:05.780]  I'm not saying to be in the video games.
[01:38:05.780 --> 01:38:08.780]  99% of people playing shoot-'em-up video games five hours a day are not going to
[01:38:08.780 --> 01:38:09.780]  go out and kill people.
[01:38:09.780 --> 01:38:12.780]  But when you're playing shoot-'em-up video games four or five hours a day,
[01:38:12.780 --> 01:38:15.780]  and then you take three Xanax and drink a half bottle of vodka,
[01:38:15.780 --> 01:38:18.780]  you think you're in the shooting game because your brain's programmed to that.
[01:38:18.780 --> 01:38:24.780]  And that's why almost all of them are on drugs and shoot-'em-up video games.
[01:38:24.780 --> 01:38:27.780]  A lot of pushback on that when I said that 20 years ago.
[01:38:27.780 --> 01:38:33.780]  Video games, shoot-'em-up video games were created by the Pentagon in the 60s
[01:38:33.780 --> 01:38:38.780]  to train people to hesitate to shoot a person up close, even the Marines.
[01:38:38.780 --> 01:38:39.780]  Don't worry.
[01:38:39.780 --> 01:38:40.780]  You're attacking me.
[01:38:40.780 --> 01:38:41.780]  I'm not going to hesitate.
[01:38:41.780 --> 01:38:42.780]  I've got a killer instinct.
[01:38:42.780 --> 01:38:44.780]  But the point is that's genetic.
[01:38:44.780 --> 01:38:45.780]  I don't want to hurt innocent people, too.
[01:38:45.780 --> 01:38:49.780]  Conrad Lorenz, human animal psychology, is the most aggressive people.
[01:38:49.780 --> 01:38:51.780]  We're also the most loving on average.
[01:38:51.780 --> 01:38:53.780]  But the point is a lot of people do not have the killer instinct.
[01:38:53.780 --> 01:38:56.780]  So they train you with video games to have the killer instinct,
[01:38:56.780 --> 01:38:59.780]  to at that moment kill when you need to kill.
[01:38:59.780 --> 01:39:00.780]  And don't worry.
[01:39:00.780 --> 01:39:01.780]  I don't want to kill anybody.
[01:39:01.780 --> 01:39:02.780]  But if I have to, I will.
[01:39:02.780 --> 01:39:06.780]  And I won't hesitate once my brain tells me now's the time to kill.
[01:39:06.780 --> 01:39:08.780]  But that's what video games do is they get rid of that inhibition.
[01:39:08.780 --> 01:39:10.780]  They create instinctive shooting.
[01:39:10.780 --> 01:39:11.780]  That's a term.
[01:39:11.780 --> 01:39:12.780]  So here's that short video.
[01:39:12.780 --> 01:39:13.780]  We'll go right to your calls.
[01:39:13.780 --> 01:39:15.780]  How about Prozac?
[01:39:15.780 --> 01:39:16.780]  You know the number one-
[01:39:16.780 --> 01:39:17.780]  Oh, that's a big sponsor, isn't it?
[01:39:17.780 --> 01:39:18.780]  Or that whole class of drugs.
[01:39:18.780 --> 01:39:19.780]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:39:19.780 --> 01:39:21.780]  Oh, whoa, gotta cut that off, don't you?
[01:39:21.780 --> 01:39:25.780]  Don't want to talk about the U.S. number one cause of death is suicide now
[01:39:25.780 --> 01:39:28.780]  because they give people suicide mass murder pills.
[01:39:28.780 --> 01:39:29.780]  Calm down.
[01:39:30.780 --> 01:39:34.780]  Psychologists can put more crazy people on drugs that make them kill people, Pierce.
[01:39:34.780 --> 01:39:35.780]  Let's try and have a debate here.
[01:39:35.780 --> 01:39:40.780]  My policy is going to be to figure out ways to protect these children.
[01:39:40.780 --> 01:39:43.780]  We cannot have any more school shootings.
[01:39:43.780 --> 01:39:51.780]  And, you know, one of the things, even if that means protecting schools the same way we protect airlines.
[01:39:51.780 --> 01:39:53.780]  You don't get shootings on airlines anymore.
[01:39:53.780 --> 01:39:56.780]  If we have to do that, we have to protect our children.
[01:39:56.780 --> 01:40:02.780]  The other thing we need to look at is the other reasons why this may be happening in our country.
[01:40:02.780 --> 01:40:08.780]  And, you know, I've gotten ridiculed for saying that we need to look at the issue of the SSRIs.
[01:40:08.780 --> 01:40:11.780]  But it's one of the issues we need to look at.
[01:40:11.780 --> 01:40:13.780]  We need to look at video games.
[01:40:13.780 --> 01:40:18.780]  We need to look at the way that social media is affecting people's behaviors.
[01:40:18.780 --> 01:40:22.780]  And do the scientific studies that are required for that.
[01:40:22.780 --> 01:40:25.780]  There has never been a time in human history
[01:40:26.780 --> 01:40:32.780]  when strangers would walk into a shooting people.
[01:40:32.780 --> 01:40:33.780]  What happened?
[01:40:33.780 --> 01:40:36.780]  You know, we had guns when I was a kid.
[01:40:36.780 --> 01:40:41.780]  You know, I went to school where we had a gun club in the school.
[01:40:41.780 --> 01:40:44.780]  And kids would come with their rifles to school.
[01:40:44.780 --> 01:40:49.780]  And nobody even imagined that somebody would go in that school and start shooting children.
[01:40:49.780 --> 01:40:54.780]  There's other countries that have almost as many guns as we do, like Switzerland,
[01:40:54.780 --> 01:40:56.780]  that don't have school shootings.
[01:40:56.780 --> 01:40:58.780]  So what is going on here?
[01:40:58.780 --> 01:41:01.780]  The last school shooting in Switzerland was 21 years ago.
[01:41:01.780 --> 01:41:04.780]  We have school shootings every 21 hours.
[01:41:04.780 --> 01:41:08.780]  One of the things we need to look at are SSRIs.
[01:41:08.780 --> 01:41:21.780]  There is one study that shows that at least 23% of school shootings have the shooter was at the time or prior or before was on SSRIs.
[01:41:21.780 --> 01:41:30.780]  And if you look at the label manufacturing the insert for these drugs,
[01:41:30.780 --> 01:41:35.780]  they say on them homicidal and suicidal ideation and action.
[01:41:35.780 --> 01:41:41.780]  So it's not insane to say we should look at this.
[01:41:41.780 --> 01:41:44.780]  Something changed in our country that started this.
[01:41:44.780 --> 01:41:46.780]  And it's not the guns.
[01:41:46.780 --> 01:41:49.780]  Because we've always had the guns.
[01:41:49.780 --> 01:41:51.780]  Something else happened.
[01:41:51.780 --> 01:41:52.780]  And we need to be looking.
[01:41:52.780 --> 01:41:54.780]  And that's the function of NIH.
[01:41:54.780 --> 01:41:57.780]  This is the biggest health threat in our country, these shootings.
[01:41:57.780 --> 01:42:00.780]  NIH is supposed to be doing science.
[01:42:00.780 --> 01:42:02.780]  It actually looks at the cause.
[01:42:02.780 --> 01:42:08.780]  The problem is it doesn't want to do anything that will offend the pharmaceutical industry.
[01:42:08.780 --> 01:42:11.780]  So they will not even do a genuine study.
[01:42:11.780 --> 01:42:16.780]  And it's hard for the public or the press to figure it out because of the HIPAA laws.
[01:42:17.780 --> 01:42:20.780]  You can't get that information on these shooters.
[01:42:20.780 --> 01:42:26.780]  But NIH can get the information, but it won't do it because it does not want to offend the pharmaceutical companies.
[01:42:26.780 --> 01:42:29.780]  And we ought to at least be looking at that.
[01:42:33.780 --> 01:42:38.780]  So the last month or two, month and a half, I've dropped the ball.
[01:42:38.780 --> 01:42:43.780]  People are like, I don't like RFK Jr. because he's anti-gun.
[01:42:43.780 --> 01:42:45.780]  And he has been a Democrat.
[01:42:45.780 --> 01:42:49.780]  And I'm like, no, no, I've seen a bunch of clips of him saying we're not taking your guns, not one gun.
[01:42:49.780 --> 01:42:50.780]  The problem is not the guns.
[01:42:50.780 --> 01:42:51.780]  It's crazy, people.
[01:42:51.780 --> 01:42:52.780]  And people are like, I haven't seen that.
[01:42:52.780 --> 01:42:54.780]  Well, there's another clip of it.
[01:42:54.780 --> 01:42:56.780]  But he's even been more specific.
[01:42:56.780 --> 01:42:57.780]  In fact, let's just do that.
[01:42:57.780 --> 01:42:58.780]  Find the clip.
[01:42:58.780 --> 01:43:01.780]  RFK Jr., I'm not going to take one gun.
[01:43:01.780 --> 01:43:03.780]  And that's absolutely true.
[01:43:03.780 --> 01:43:05.780]  So he's on our side.
[01:43:05.780 --> 01:43:06.780]  He was already awake a lot.
[01:43:06.780 --> 01:43:09.780]  But I'll be quite honest with you.
[01:43:09.780 --> 01:43:11.780]  Obviously, the show helped deprogram him.
[01:43:11.780 --> 01:43:15.780]  And just what the globalists have done helped deprogram him.
[01:43:15.780 --> 01:43:16.780]  They hate him.
[01:43:16.780 --> 01:43:17.780]  That's why they're attacking him.
[01:43:17.780 --> 01:43:19.780]  And he's just injecting truth everywhere.
[01:43:19.780 --> 01:43:20.780]  And he's a great guy.
[01:43:20.780 --> 01:43:22.780]  And Trump has said that too.
[01:43:22.780 --> 01:43:25.780]  OK, I want to go ahead and take your phone calls.
[01:43:25.780 --> 01:43:29.780]  I've got a lot of other news here, literally over 50 incredible stories like this one.
[01:43:29.780 --> 01:43:32.780]  Supreme Court yesterday overturned affirmative action.
[01:43:32.780 --> 01:43:37.780]  And again, they act like, oh, that's so mean to the black people or whatever.
[01:43:37.780 --> 01:43:41.780]  Ladies and gentlemen, the college degrees are worthless on average.
[01:43:41.780 --> 01:43:43.780]  Let's get that first straight.
[01:43:43.780 --> 01:43:46.780]  I'm not saying you can't get some value, but they're overpriced.
[01:43:46.780 --> 01:43:52.780]  But you can't just say we're going to replace one discriminatory system with another.
[01:43:52.780 --> 01:43:57.780]  That is a good sign of a Supreme Court, a very, very good sign.
[01:43:57.780 --> 01:44:02.780]  But, again, it's not like as a white dude I'm trying to be the police chief
[01:44:02.780 --> 01:44:06.780]  or I'm trying to be, you know, get the full scholarship.
[01:44:06.780 --> 01:44:08.780]  Because, you know, I don't want to be in the system.
[01:44:08.780 --> 01:44:14.780]  But right now Chicago always did this thing with police chiefs and promotions or whatever
[01:44:14.780 --> 01:44:17.780]  where it was like the senior people would be the next guy.
[01:44:17.780 --> 01:44:19.780]  And great, have a black police chief.
[01:44:19.780 --> 01:44:20.780]  Sounds wonderful.
[01:44:20.780 --> 01:44:21.780]  I don't care.
[01:44:21.780 --> 01:44:22.780]  As long as they do a good job.
[01:44:22.780 --> 01:44:25.780]  But then they pass over and there's like no white police chiefs in those areas now in big cities.
[01:44:25.780 --> 01:44:27.780]  Like, well, we just don't have white people.
[01:44:28.780 --> 01:44:32.780]  You don't replace one thing that's wrong with another.
[01:44:32.780 --> 01:44:35.780]  I know that's very, very simple and all of you get that.
[01:44:35.780 --> 01:44:41.780]  But it also creates resentment, actually creates the racism that they claim is rampant
[01:44:41.780 --> 01:44:47.780]  because it puts people in a racial perspective because you've been – it's happened to you.
[01:44:47.780 --> 01:44:51.780]  And it's just like Biden promising free tuition to everybody and all the rest of it or reparations.
[01:44:51.780 --> 01:44:53.780]  You're never going to get that.
[01:44:53.780 --> 01:44:55.780]  There's no free lunch, folks.
[01:44:55.780 --> 01:44:57.780]  And stop thinking that.
[01:44:57.780 --> 01:45:02.780]  Oh, you might get something free for a little while, but you're going to pay for it dearly.
[01:45:02.780 --> 01:45:04.780]  All right.
[01:45:04.780 --> 01:45:06.780]  Let's go to your phone calls here.
[01:45:06.780 --> 01:45:08.780]  Who has been holding the longest?
[01:45:08.780 --> 01:45:11.780]  I guess they all came in about 16 minutes ago.
[01:45:11.780 --> 01:45:13.780]  We opened the phone calls up.
[01:45:13.780 --> 01:45:18.780]  So let's just take them in the order they are received here.
[01:45:18.780 --> 01:45:21.780]  Let's go to Obadiah in Vegas.
[01:45:21.780 --> 01:45:23.780]  You're on the air, Obadiah.
[01:45:23.780 --> 01:45:25.780]  What's up, Alex?
[01:45:25.780 --> 01:45:26.780]  God bless you.
[01:45:26.780 --> 01:45:28.780]  What's on your mind?
[01:45:28.780 --> 01:45:34.780]  Okay, so number one, the pharmaceutical industry is as dirty as can be.
[01:45:34.780 --> 01:45:40.780]  The Greek word of pharmakia is sorcery, witchcraft, black magic.
[01:45:40.780 --> 01:45:46.780]  And in the Bible, the book of Genesis, the book of Ezekiel, the book of Revelation,
[01:45:46.780 --> 01:45:52.780]  all say that the herb is for the healing of all the nations and the leaves are for meat.
[01:45:52.780 --> 01:45:57.780]  So to you Christians out there, you people professing to be Christians,
[01:45:57.780 --> 01:46:03.780]  why are you going to these doctors for chemicals that are petrochemical-based
[01:46:03.780 --> 01:46:07.780]  for whatever ailment that you have when the Holy Scriptures say
[01:46:07.780 --> 01:46:10.780]  the herb is for the healing of all the nations?
[01:46:10.780 --> 01:46:16.780]  Number two, the pharmaceutical industry is responsible for $35 billion in fines,
[01:46:16.780 --> 01:46:21.780]  and their internal emails come out where they say that they're going to go forward.
[01:46:21.780 --> 01:46:24.780]  A lot of people are going to get hurt by this, but we're going to go forward with it
[01:46:24.780 --> 01:46:27.780]  because the profits are going to outweigh the fines.
[01:46:27.780 --> 01:46:32.780]  So I hate to be as cold as this is, but if you're still going to these doctors,
[01:46:32.780 --> 01:46:34.780]  and even look at that word doctor.
[01:46:34.780 --> 01:46:40.780]  If you told the IRS that you doctored your tax form, what do you think would happen?
[01:46:40.780 --> 01:46:42.780]  Doctor means manipulate.
[01:46:42.780 --> 01:46:49.780]  So their business model is to get as many people as possible on as many pills as possible
[01:46:49.780 --> 01:46:51.780]  for as long as possible.
[01:46:51.780 --> 01:46:53.780]  And they're the third leading cause of death.
[01:46:53.780 --> 01:46:57.780]  Estrogenesis is the third leading cause of death in America.
[01:46:57.780 --> 01:46:59.780]  Medical mistake or misdiagnosis.
[01:46:59.780 --> 01:47:04.780]  So you have a 33% chance of dying if you go to a doctor.
[01:47:04.780 --> 01:47:08.780]  You go to a doctor for the common—they don't even have—they admit to you
[01:47:08.780 --> 01:47:10.780]  that they don't even have the cure for the common cold.
[01:47:10.780 --> 01:47:16.780]  So if they admit to you they don't have a cure for the common cold, AIDS, cancer, anything,
[01:47:16.780 --> 01:47:19.780]  what do they understand?
[01:47:19.780 --> 01:47:23.780]  Well, I mean, I've always said that doctors on average are good people,
[01:47:23.780 --> 01:47:28.780]  but the system that owns them and controls them is predatory and evil and transhumanist.
[01:47:28.780 --> 01:47:32.780]  And so a doctor's great if you've got a gunshot wound or break your leg,
[01:47:32.780 --> 01:47:34.780]  and they can set it and fix it.
[01:47:34.780 --> 01:47:37.780]  They're wonderful when you've got a rotten tooth.
[01:47:37.780 --> 01:47:40.780]  They're wonderful when you break your nose.
[01:47:40.780 --> 01:47:45.780]  They're wonderful to do things like that.
[01:47:45.780 --> 01:47:48.780]  But when it comes to all the rest of it, it's pure garbage.
[01:47:48.780 --> 01:47:53.780]  And as the corporations take over the medical system, they become more and more predatory.
[01:47:53.780 --> 01:47:55.780]  Powerful points, Obadiah.
[01:47:55.780 --> 01:47:57.780]  Thank you.
[01:47:57.780 --> 01:48:00.780]  Let's take a call from John.
[01:48:00.780 --> 01:48:03.780]  John is calling from Nebraska, where I'm at right now.
[01:48:03.780 --> 01:48:05.780]  Go ahead, John, you're on the air.
[01:48:05.780 --> 01:48:11.780]  Alex, I want to thank you for bringing to Omaha the much-needed rain.
[01:48:11.780 --> 01:48:14.780]  It did rain all last night.
[01:48:14.780 --> 01:48:15.780]  I slept really good.
[01:48:15.780 --> 01:48:17.780]  I've been without a storm.
[01:48:17.780 --> 01:48:21.780]  Yeah, it poured, and it's supposed to pour off and on the next several days.
[01:48:21.780 --> 01:48:23.780]  So thank you.
[01:48:23.780 --> 01:48:28.780]  Segues to the weather wars, which probably there's been some blocking of the jet stream,
[01:48:28.780 --> 01:48:33.780]  which has caused your state to melt from the heat.
[01:48:33.780 --> 01:48:40.780]  Learned all about HAARP and weather manipulation and what have you at a Steve Quayle conference.
[01:48:41.780 --> 01:48:49.780]  Princess Diana was murdered late August 97, and that brings me to Dr. Lynn Horowitz,
[01:48:49.780 --> 01:48:53.780]  who I think would be a great guest.
[01:48:53.780 --> 01:48:55.780]  Are you there, buddy?
[01:48:55.780 --> 01:48:57.780]  I'm listening.
[01:48:57.780 --> 01:48:59.780]  Okay.
[01:48:59.780 --> 01:49:01.780]  I would love to get a song.
[01:49:01.780 --> 01:49:03.780]  I was thinking about Horowitz just like last week.
[01:49:03.780 --> 01:49:04.780]  Where is Horowitz?
[01:49:04.780 --> 01:49:06.780]  He's here all the time.
[01:49:06.780 --> 01:49:13.780]  Yeah, beat me, but anyway, he had quite a program at Steve's conference on AIDS,
[01:49:13.780 --> 01:49:23.780]  and I'm pretty sure he mentioned Dr. Fauci back then in 97 as being a conduit of the distribution of AIDS.
[01:49:23.780 --> 01:49:26.780]  He was involved in the whole thing, yeah.
[01:49:26.780 --> 01:49:28.780]  Oh, and a minute ago you mentioned OJ.
[01:49:28.780 --> 01:49:32.780]  Well, somehow I got in yesterday and talked to Owen,
[01:49:32.780 --> 01:49:38.780]  and I was simply mentioning a few guests that you might want to have and topics,
[01:49:38.780 --> 01:49:46.780]  and I mentioned on Dr. Stan Monti, years ago he had a fellow named William Deere,
[01:49:46.780 --> 01:49:53.780]  who was a celebrated private investigator, who wrote a book entitled OJ is Innocent,
[01:49:53.780 --> 01:49:55.780]  and I Can Prove It.
[01:49:55.780 --> 01:49:58.780]  I remember that book.
[01:49:58.780 --> 01:49:59.780]  I remember that book.
[01:49:59.780 --> 01:50:01.780]  John in Nebraska, thank you so much, sir.
[01:50:01.780 --> 01:50:02.780]  Thank you for the call.
[01:50:02.780 --> 01:50:05.780]  Let's go to Tim in Seattle on bioweapons.
[01:50:05.780 --> 01:50:06.780]  Tim, you're on the air.
[01:50:06.780 --> 01:50:07.780]  Welcome.
[01:50:07.780 --> 01:50:09.780]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[01:50:09.780 --> 01:50:10.780]  Amazing broadcast as always.
[01:50:10.780 --> 01:50:14.780]  I'd like to give a plug first for the amazing Red Pill Plus.
[01:50:14.780 --> 01:50:19.780]  That combination, whatever you put in that, that formulation is amazing.
[01:50:19.780 --> 01:50:24.780]  My energy level is just through the ceiling already.
[01:50:24.780 --> 01:50:29.780]  I mean, I've lost about 10 pounds and gained about 15 mass, muscle mass.
[01:50:29.780 --> 01:50:30.780]  It's great stuff.
[01:50:30.780 --> 01:50:31.780]  I'm putting that out.
[01:50:31.780 --> 01:50:35.780]  I think Real Red Pill was sold out for two-plus years because we couldn't get the ingredients
[01:50:35.780 --> 01:50:39.780]  in the lockdowns, and I think it's almost sold out or is about to sell out.
[01:50:39.780 --> 01:50:41.780]  I mean, I'm not hyping any of these products.
[01:50:41.780 --> 01:50:46.780]  They're all amazing, but Real Red Pill takes a few weeks to kick in,
[01:50:46.780 --> 01:50:48.780]  but once it kicks in, it is just incredible.
[01:50:48.780 --> 01:50:50.780]  Got to take it every day for a couple weeks, and then you're going to be like,
[01:50:50.780 --> 01:50:52.780]  whoa, it's amazing.
[01:50:52.780 --> 01:50:53.780]  Exactly.
[01:50:53.780 --> 01:50:54.780]  It didn't really hit me.
[01:50:54.780 --> 01:50:56.780]  I thought it would be like a pep pill.
[01:50:56.780 --> 01:51:01.780]  If I'm not going to take some coffee with me, I'll just take this Real Red Pill Plus.
[01:51:01.780 --> 01:51:02.780]  But it didn't kick in like that.
[01:51:02.780 --> 01:51:07.780]  It waited for about four or five days, and then I just started feeling this surge.
[01:51:07.780 --> 01:51:08.780]  So it's good stuff.
[01:51:08.780 --> 01:51:12.780]  I hope you can keep it on sale or at least available.
[01:51:12.780 --> 01:51:18.780]  But the bioweapon, everything in our lives is either a chemical weapon or a bioweapon
[01:51:18.780 --> 01:51:22.780]  or some sort of psychological warfare weapon aimed against us.
[01:51:22.780 --> 01:51:24.780]  We have to realize that it's a concentration camp.
[01:51:24.780 --> 01:51:25.780]  We are not living in America.
[01:51:25.780 --> 01:51:28.780]  We are living in an occupied nation.
[01:51:28.780 --> 01:51:30.780]  We have to realize this.
[01:51:30.780 --> 01:51:32.780]  We have to act accordingly.
[01:51:32.780 --> 01:51:33.780]  We have to take to the streets.
[01:51:33.780 --> 01:51:35.780]  We have to be as peaceful as possible.
[01:51:35.780 --> 01:51:40.780]  But yet, just as Professor Desmet said, after six months of silence,
[01:51:40.780 --> 01:51:45.780]  once we give up hope in six months, that's when the mass formationists commit atrocities.
[01:51:45.780 --> 01:51:47.780]  And we have to realize that.
[01:51:47.780 --> 01:51:48.780]  I totally agree.
[01:51:48.780 --> 01:51:50.780]  We're in a partially occupied country.
[01:51:50.780 --> 01:51:51.780]  They're not in full control.
[01:51:51.780 --> 01:51:52.780]  They're trying to get full control.
[01:51:52.780 --> 01:51:54.780]  But look at Real Red Pill Plus.
[01:51:54.780 --> 01:51:56.780]  It was in stock, almost sold out.
[01:51:56.780 --> 01:52:00.780]  4.9-star reviews right there.
[01:52:00.780 --> 01:52:02.780]  Everybody should take Real Red Pill Plus.
[01:52:02.780 --> 01:52:04.780]  In fact, it's discounted right now.
[01:52:04.780 --> 01:52:08.780]  It is an amazing, amazing product, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:52:08.780 --> 01:52:10.780]  And so absolutely, everybody should take it.
[01:52:10.780 --> 01:52:13.780]  It's got natural green tea and urban mate and natural stimulants,
[01:52:13.780 --> 01:52:15.780]  so you feel it the first day.
[01:52:15.780 --> 01:52:17.780]  But that's just a little added kick.
[01:52:17.780 --> 01:52:18.780]  That's why it's a plus.
[01:52:18.780 --> 01:52:23.780]  It's the preglanone and the key amino acids and stuff that, for most people,
[01:52:23.780 --> 01:52:26.780]  are deficient in preglanone, even though they're young.
[01:52:26.780 --> 01:52:29.780]  So it helps your body create hormones to counter all the fake hormones
[01:52:29.780 --> 01:52:30.780]  we're being bombarded with.
[01:52:30.780 --> 01:52:33.780]  Everybody needs to get Real Red Pill Plus at InfoWarsaw.com.
[01:52:33.780 --> 01:52:37.780]  It's just as important as Nitric Boost or as the X2 and X3 products.
[01:52:37.780 --> 01:52:39.780]  All of it is in synergy.
[01:52:39.780 --> 01:52:43.780]  When I forget to take them, I just kick myself because they work so well.
[01:52:44.070 --> 01:52:45.070]  Still there, Tim?
[01:52:45.070 --> 01:52:46.070]  Oh, yeah.
[01:52:46.070 --> 01:52:47.070]  Yeah.
[01:52:47.070 --> 01:52:48.070]  I'm sorry.
[01:52:48.070 --> 01:52:49.070]  Yeah.
[01:52:49.070 --> 01:52:50.070]  I thought I was going to.
[01:52:50.070 --> 01:52:51.070]  Yeah.
[01:52:51.070 --> 01:52:52.070]  But you're right.
[01:52:52.070 --> 01:52:53.070]  You're amazing.
[01:52:53.070 --> 01:52:54.070]  Right.
[01:52:54.070 --> 01:52:59.590]  And I'd also like to give a shout out to the TMI group that's on Rumble and Discord.
[01:52:59.590 --> 01:53:04.150]  These guys are based info warriors, and if you ever have missed a broadcast or if you're
[01:53:04.150 --> 01:53:09.309]  not quite sure of what's going on, the discussion starts as soon as you guys go off air.
[01:53:09.309 --> 01:53:13.509]  It starts again at six o'clock and continues on until we decide to end it.
[01:53:13.830 --> 01:53:14.830]  Beautiful brother.
[01:53:14.830 --> 01:53:15.830]  We appreciate you, Tim.
[01:53:15.830 --> 01:53:18.230]  And let's take that little two minutes where he talks about Real Red Bull Plus.
[01:53:18.230 --> 01:53:22.910]  Let's make an ad out of that and run that because, again, when I was 40, I went to a
[01:53:22.910 --> 01:53:23.910]  medical doctor.
[01:53:23.910 --> 01:53:28.150]  They took like 18 blood tests, and they checked everything, and they said, you've got actually
[01:53:28.150 --> 01:53:34.910]  good testosterone at 40 compared to most men, but it's converting to estrogen quickly,
[01:53:34.910 --> 01:53:35.910]  and your preglanone's low.
[01:53:35.910 --> 01:53:36.910]  And I said, what's preglanone?
[01:53:36.910 --> 01:53:40.269]  They said, well, they used to give it to everybody for arthritis and everything, but it doesn't
[01:53:40.269 --> 01:53:42.670]  make the big companies money.
[01:53:42.830 --> 01:53:45.389]  They phased it out, and they're trying to control it and ban it, but they haven't been
[01:53:45.389 --> 01:53:46.389]  able to yet.
[01:53:46.389 --> 01:53:50.630]  They said, take this, and that's when I lost all that weight and got all into shape and
[01:53:50.630 --> 01:53:51.630]  everything.
[01:53:51.630 --> 01:53:57.309]  So we put out the formula they had but souped up at info war store, and then for whatever
[01:53:57.309 --> 01:53:59.790]  reason, you couldn't get the preglanone.
[01:53:59.790 --> 01:54:01.150]  There's a crappy form and a good form.
[01:54:01.150 --> 01:54:03.150]  We couldn't get the good form for over two years.
[01:54:03.150 --> 01:54:04.269]  Two and a half years sold out.
[01:54:04.269 --> 01:54:05.710]  It's now back in stock.
[01:54:05.710 --> 01:54:10.349]  Real Red Bull Plus, you need it, and we ordered a bunch of it.
[01:54:10.349 --> 01:54:11.349]  It's almost sold out.
[01:54:11.349 --> 01:54:12.349]  I'm told there's like 2,000.
[01:54:13.030 --> 01:54:14.030]  I checked when he was talking.
[01:54:14.030 --> 01:54:15.030]  2,000 bottles left.
[01:54:15.030 --> 01:54:16.030]  Infowarestore.com.
[01:54:16.030 --> 01:54:17.030]  Real red pill.
[01:54:17.030 --> 01:54:18.030]  You need to take it.
[01:54:18.030 --> 01:54:20.309]  He said it hit him in like a week.
[01:54:20.309 --> 01:54:21.549]  It's like X2 and X3.
[01:54:21.549 --> 01:54:24.110]  It takes two weeks to hit for me.
[01:54:24.110 --> 01:54:28.990]  And it feels great, and you forget to take it, and then it's like, whoa, what just happened?
[01:54:28.990 --> 01:54:31.750]  You got to take it every day.
[01:54:31.750 --> 01:54:35.309]  And it is powerful, folks, because it's the precursor your body produces that all the hormones
[01:54:35.309 --> 01:54:36.309]  are made out of.
[01:54:36.309 --> 01:54:39.429]  You've got to have the preglanone, and you can buy preglanone for other people if you
[01:54:39.429 --> 01:54:40.429]  want.
[01:54:40.429 --> 01:54:41.429]  It's great.
[01:54:41.429 --> 01:54:42.429]  All the formulas out there.
[01:54:42.429 --> 01:54:43.429]  Infowarestore.com.
[01:54:43.429 --> 01:54:44.429]  Okay.
[01:54:44.429 --> 01:54:45.429]  Let's take another caller.
[01:54:45.429 --> 01:54:46.429]  Who's been home the longest here?
[01:54:46.429 --> 01:54:47.429]  Let's go to Jason in the great state of Texas.
[01:54:47.429 --> 01:54:48.429]  Jason, you're on the air.
[01:54:48.429 --> 01:54:49.429]  Welcome.
[01:54:49.429 --> 01:54:50.429]  General Jones.
[01:54:50.429 --> 01:54:51.429]  How are we doing today?
[01:54:51.429 --> 01:54:52.429]  Man, I am blessed, and my father-in-law is doing a lot better.
[01:54:52.429 --> 01:54:53.429]  He was kind of out of it and was almost dead three or four days ago, and he's doing a lot
[01:54:53.429 --> 01:54:54.429]  better now.
[01:54:54.429 --> 01:54:55.429]  People bounce back.
[01:54:55.429 --> 01:54:56.429]  I told my wife, pray to God.
[01:54:56.429 --> 01:54:57.429]  We prayed a lot.
[01:54:57.429 --> 01:54:58.429]  He's bouncing back.
[01:54:58.429 --> 01:54:59.429]  We're not out of the woods yet, so thank you.
[01:54:59.429 --> 01:55:00.429]  All righty.
[01:55:00.429 --> 01:55:01.429]  Let me call you back.
[01:55:01.429 --> 01:55:02.429]  All right.
[01:55:02.429 --> 01:55:03.429]  All right.
[01:55:03.429 --> 01:55:04.429]  All right.
[01:55:04.429 --> 01:55:05.429]  All right.
[01:55:05.429 --> 01:55:06.429]  All right.
[01:55:06.429 --> 01:55:07.429]  All right.
[01:55:11.429 --> 01:55:15.990]  I'm going to start off by saying what a beautiful rendition of our national anthem that young
[01:55:15.990 --> 01:55:19.910]  woman sang the other day.
[01:55:19.910 --> 01:55:21.630]  Octavia Wilder.
[01:55:21.630 --> 01:55:25.630]  You should have seen it in person or heard it in person.
[01:55:25.630 --> 01:55:26.630]  It was beautiful.
[01:55:26.630 --> 01:55:33.509]  But like we've been talking about here and you today and yesterday, the whole goal was
[01:55:33.509 --> 01:55:38.990]  to eliminate Republicans and conservatives from this planet so Democrats can hold power
[01:55:38.990 --> 01:55:46.110]  forever, which they will, and Texas better get their crap together because illegals outnumber
[01:55:46.110 --> 01:55:49.830]  Americans now in Texas.
[01:55:49.830 --> 01:55:50.830]  Well that's important.
[01:55:50.830 --> 01:55:52.830]  I don't hate the illegal aliens that came here.
[01:55:52.830 --> 01:55:53.830]  They want a better life.
[01:55:53.830 --> 01:55:54.830]  But they're being controlled.
[01:55:54.830 --> 01:55:56.830]  They're being used by the globalists.
[01:55:56.830 --> 01:55:58.990]  And yeah, whites are now the minority in Texas.
[01:55:58.990 --> 01:56:01.230]  I'm so sick of hearing about my white privilege.
[01:56:01.230 --> 01:56:04.549]  I'm so sick of hearing about this power I have and all this crap.
[01:56:04.549 --> 01:56:05.549]  I don't want to hear about what color.
[01:56:05.549 --> 01:56:09.389]  I want to hear about what I produce and what I stand for, like Martin Luther King said.
[01:56:09.389 --> 01:56:11.429]  And people go, well, Martin Luther King was a communist.
[01:56:11.429 --> 01:56:12.910]  The point is, I do agree with him.
[01:56:12.910 --> 01:56:14.910]  I don't listen to Jimi Hendrix because he was black.
[01:56:14.910 --> 01:56:15.910]  The guitar playing's great.
[01:56:15.910 --> 01:56:18.309]  I don't go to a restaurant because Vietnamese on it.
[01:56:18.309 --> 01:56:19.950]  The food tastes good.
[01:56:19.950 --> 01:56:23.750]  What I care about is what you produce and what you stand for.
[01:56:23.750 --> 01:56:25.030]  I don't judge a book by its cover.
[01:56:25.030 --> 01:56:26.030]  I judge it by the content.
[01:56:26.030 --> 01:56:30.030]  You're absolutely right that they're bringing in giant third world populations to create
[01:56:30.030 --> 01:56:31.469]  a Tower of Babel situation.
[01:56:31.469 --> 01:56:32.469]  And it's wrong.
[01:56:32.469 --> 01:56:34.590]  We've got to get control of that border.
[01:56:34.630 --> 01:56:35.630]  Exactly.
[01:56:35.630 --> 01:56:37.509]  It's time to wake up, everybody.
[01:56:37.509 --> 01:56:40.990]  Stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's going to go on at the end of all
[01:56:40.990 --> 01:56:41.990]  this.
[01:56:41.990 --> 01:56:42.990]  But you want to fight?
[01:56:42.990 --> 01:56:44.990]  You better believe you got one.
[01:56:44.990 --> 01:56:47.990]  Thank you, sir.
[01:56:47.990 --> 01:56:48.990]  We're going to go to break.
[01:56:48.990 --> 01:56:49.990]  Come back with more calls.
[01:56:49.990 --> 01:56:50.990]  The pastor's called to join us.
[01:56:50.990 --> 01:56:56.190]  But since you asked for it, let's get more Octavia Wilder.
[01:56:56.190 --> 01:56:59.190]  She did a God bless America.
[01:56:59.190 --> 01:57:00.190]  Let's come back.
[01:57:00.190 --> 01:57:02.429]  God bless America.
[01:57:02.429 --> 01:57:03.429]  And then I'll talk a few minutes.
[01:57:03.429 --> 01:57:07.670]  That little no man's land segment when we come back, take more calls and have a special
[01:57:07.670 --> 01:57:08.670]  guest joining us as well.
[01:57:08.670 --> 01:57:09.670]  The right shotgun.
[01:57:09.670 --> 01:57:11.670]  We're going to air Raymond Sillars.
[01:57:11.670 --> 01:57:14.670]  Am I pronouncing that right?
[01:57:14.670 --> 01:57:15.670]  Sillars.
[01:57:15.670 --> 01:57:20.670]  Raymond Sillars at the incredible, it really is incredible, River Church in Tampa, Florida.
[01:57:20.670 --> 01:57:21.670]  Revival.com.
[01:57:21.670 --> 01:57:25.309]  I mean, this was like a four hour and a half event.
[01:57:25.309 --> 01:57:29.230]  I've been up since six a.m. and a four hour Sunday service was amazing.
[01:57:29.230 --> 01:57:32.110]  Then I went into this four plus hour event.
[01:57:32.790 --> 01:57:33.790]  And it was just wild.
[01:57:33.790 --> 01:57:38.549]  And we still had, they had 600 people in the little studio they did and a couple thousand
[01:57:38.549 --> 01:57:39.549]  outside couldn't get in.
[01:57:39.549 --> 01:57:40.549]  They were an outside pavilion after watching some Jumbotron.
[01:57:40.549 --> 01:57:45.549]  And I wanted to go out and shake hands at the end of it, but man, I literally, when
[01:57:45.549 --> 01:57:51.549]  I got to my hotel, I stumbled and actually, InfoWars is a one of a kind operation.
[01:57:51.549 --> 01:57:55.070]  And so please go to InfoWars store and just make a donation.

[01:58:17.990 --> 01:58:18.990]  on the products.

[01:58:19.990 --> 01:58:22.230]  The big July 4 sell is going on right now.
[01:58:22.230 --> 01:58:24.790]  This is such a critical platform in the fight against the new world order.
[01:58:24.790 --> 01:58:26.910]  The enemies out in the open were vindicated.
[01:58:26.910 --> 01:58:28.269]  People are listening more than ever.
[01:58:28.269 --> 01:58:32.670]  In this major recession, going into depression and with supply chain breakdowns, I know it's
[01:58:32.670 --> 01:58:33.670]  hard.
[01:58:33.670 --> 01:58:34.670]  I know times are tough.

[01:59:19.429 --> 01:59:20.429]  It boosts women.
[01:59:20.429 --> 01:59:21.429]  It works great.
[01:59:21.429 --> 01:59:24.870]  But women like pink labels, men like different color labels.
[01:59:24.870 --> 01:59:26.910]  So it works for men as well.
[01:59:26.910 --> 01:59:27.990]  It's the same formula.

[02:02:06.269 --> 02:02:26.269]  God bless America, land that I love.
[02:02:26.269 --> 02:02:38.269]  Stand beside her and guide her through the night with the light from above.
[02:02:38.269 --> 02:02:50.269]  From the mountains, to the prairies, to the oceans wide with love.
[02:02:50.269 --> 02:03:02.269]  God bless America, thy home sweet home.

[02:03:41.269 --> 02:03:45.269]  Amazing creature God made right there.
[02:03:45.269 --> 02:03:47.269]  Voice of an angel.
[02:03:51.269 --> 02:03:58.269]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the information war and say,
[02:03:58.269 --> 02:04:01.269]  I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[02:04:01.269 --> 02:04:05.269]  You better believe you've got one.
[02:04:05.269 --> 02:04:11.269]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:04:12.269 --> 02:04:29.269]  We've got to have the will.
[02:04:29.269 --> 02:04:33.269]  We've set the truth and bucked the system and the group collective.
[02:04:33.269 --> 02:04:38.269]  Do that, and you'll earn your way to the next level.
[02:04:38.269 --> 02:04:58.269]  This is the info war.
[02:04:58.269 --> 02:05:03.269]  Infowarsstore.com is like a grocery store or like a vitamin shop.

[02:05:07.269 --> 02:05:09.269]  So I get constant questions online and in person.
[02:05:09.269 --> 02:05:10.269]  Hey, what's better?
[02:05:10.269 --> 02:05:11.269]  Knockout.
[02:05:11.269 --> 02:05:12.269]  What's better?
[02:05:12.269 --> 02:05:13.269]  Down and out.
[02:05:13.269 --> 02:05:14.269]  What's better?
[02:05:14.269 --> 02:05:16.269]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[02:05:16.269 --> 02:05:18.269]  And the answer is different herbal formulas.
[02:05:18.269 --> 02:05:21.269]  Different compounds are better for different people.
[02:05:21.269 --> 02:05:24.269]  So one person might like this coffee.
[02:05:24.269 --> 02:05:25.269]  Another person likes that coffee.
[02:05:25.269 --> 02:05:27.269]  That's how our bodies work.
[02:05:27.269 --> 02:05:28.269]  They're all very diverse.
[02:05:28.269 --> 02:05:32.269]  But we've been able to private label a national best seller that's been sold

[02:06:14.269 --> 02:06:15.269]  Good night.
[02:06:45.269 --> 02:07:00.269]  After seven years of violent revolution,
[02:07:00.269 --> 02:07:05.269]  our American founders were well aware that political factions were most often
[02:07:05.269 --> 02:07:08.269]  used to divide and conquer the people.
[02:07:08.269 --> 02:07:12.269]  And they knew that the republic they created would only last as long as the
[02:07:12.269 --> 02:07:15.269]  people could remain educated.
[02:07:15.269 --> 02:07:17.269]  In 1816, Thomas Jefferson wrote,
[02:07:17.269 --> 02:07:22.269]  if a nation expects to be ignorant and free in a state of civilization,
[02:07:22.269 --> 02:07:27.269]  it expects what never was and never will be.
[02:07:27.269 --> 02:07:31.269]  By the end of the civil war, the two-party system became the norm.
[02:07:31.269 --> 02:07:35.269]  The globalist system we face today was born.
[02:07:35.269 --> 02:07:40.269]  And the deliberate dumbing down of the American citizen began with our great,
[02:07:40.269 --> 02:07:44.269]  great grandparents. In the late 1800s,
[02:07:44.269 --> 02:07:50.269]  the Skinner Pavlovian method was brought into American schools by Johns Hopkins.
[02:07:50.269 --> 02:07:55.269]  These psychological methods allowed teachers the ability to program students'
[02:07:55.269 --> 02:08:00.269]  behavior in the same way that Pavlov did with dogs.
[02:08:00.269 --> 02:08:01.269]  In 1934,
[02:08:01.269 --> 02:08:06.269]  the Carnegie International Endowment for Peace published the report on the
[02:08:06.269 --> 02:08:08.269]  Commission on Social Studies,
[02:08:08.269 --> 02:08:13.269]  which explicitly stated the goal of eventually taking away people's land and
[02:08:13.269 --> 02:08:17.269]  noted that most people would obviously oppose this.
[02:08:17.269 --> 02:08:22.269]  The solution was to begin using the school system to recondition the minds of
[02:08:22.269 --> 02:08:25.269]  children. In 1976,
[02:08:25.269 --> 02:08:29.269]  the bicentennial year of the Declaration of Independence,
[02:08:29.269 --> 02:08:34.269]  124 congressmen signed the Declaration of Interdependence,
[02:08:34.269 --> 02:08:37.269]  which stated that two centuries ago,
[02:08:37.269 --> 02:08:40.269]  our forefathers brought forth a new nation.
[02:08:40.269 --> 02:08:45.269]  Now we must join with others to bring forth a new world order.
[02:08:45.269 --> 02:08:50.269]  And it pledged to give children special attention in distributing a common
[02:08:50.269 --> 02:08:53.269]  education to suit their goals.
[02:08:53.269 --> 02:08:55.269]  By the 1990s,
[02:08:55.269 --> 02:09:01.269]  this globalist dumbing down system was perfected and America began exporting it
[02:09:01.269 --> 02:09:06.269]  worldwide in what is known as outcome-based education.
[02:09:06.269 --> 02:09:08.269]  Starting in 2010,
[02:09:08.269 --> 02:09:12.269]  Common Core began in the United States.
[02:09:12.269 --> 02:09:17.269]  It outlined what students were expected to know at each grade level and enforced
[02:09:17.269 --> 02:09:20.269]  ways to assess those standards.
[02:09:20.269 --> 02:09:22.269]  Charlotte Isserby,
[02:09:22.269 --> 02:09:25.269]  author of The Deliberate Dumbing Down of America,
[02:09:25.269 --> 02:09:30.269]  has traced most of this agenda stemming from the order of skull and bones at
[02:09:30.269 --> 02:09:34.269]  Yale through both Republicans and Democrats,
[02:09:34.269 --> 02:09:37.269]  two wings of the same globalist bird,
[02:09:37.269 --> 02:09:43.269]  which understood that dumbed down people have a base desire for a simple
[02:09:43.269 --> 02:09:45.269]  dualistic choice.
[02:09:45.269 --> 02:09:47.269]  In 1953,
[02:09:47.269 --> 02:09:51.269]  the Rockefeller Foundation funded the robber's cave experiment,
[02:09:51.269 --> 02:09:56.269]  wherein 11 year old boys who thought they were signing up for summer camp were
[02:09:56.269 --> 02:10:01.269]  organized into two separate tribes and were manipulated into fighting each
[02:10:01.269 --> 02:10:02.269]  other,
[02:10:02.269 --> 02:10:06.269]  which was easily accomplished by having a single resource that the two groups
[02:10:06.269 --> 02:10:08.269]  competed for.
[02:10:08.269 --> 02:10:13.269]  The Henry Toshville experiments of the 1970s showed that by simply dividing
[02:10:13.269 --> 02:10:15.269]  people into two groups,
[02:10:15.269 --> 02:10:19.269]  they would naturally identify with their own group and discriminate against the
[02:10:19.269 --> 02:10:20.269]  other.
[02:10:20.269 --> 02:10:24.269]  The basic ego mind is constantly making preferences.
[02:10:25.269 --> 02:10:29.269]  No matter how you have an opinion about everything.
[02:10:29.269 --> 02:10:33.269]  And if you can keep the population dumb enough and give them two parties to
[02:10:33.269 --> 02:10:34.269]  choose from,
[02:10:34.269 --> 02:10:38.269]  they will innately identify with one and despise the other.
[02:10:38.269 --> 02:10:40.269]  This allows the globalist system,
[02:10:40.269 --> 02:10:46.269]  the cover they need to implement unpopular policies such as a central bank
[02:10:46.269 --> 02:10:48.269]  digital currency.
[02:10:48.269 --> 02:10:49.269]  While we,
[02:10:49.269 --> 02:10:51.269]  the people ignorantly fight each other,
[02:10:51.269 --> 02:10:52.269]  united,
[02:10:52.269 --> 02:10:54.269]  we stand divided.
[02:10:54.269 --> 02:10:58.269]  We fall and we've been falling for it for generations.
[02:10:58.269 --> 02:11:03.269]  The American people have been so thoroughly dumbed down that we think freedom
[02:11:03.269 --> 02:11:07.269]  is the ability to choose between two parties working for the same control
[02:11:07.269 --> 02:11:08.269]  system.
[02:11:08.269 --> 02:11:13.269]  And we have been made so weak that we are afraid to even discuss the option of
[02:11:13.269 --> 02:11:14.269]  violence,
[02:11:14.269 --> 02:11:17.269]  which is most often the only remedy for tyranny.
[02:11:17.269 --> 02:11:20.269]  But if we were an enlightened people,
[02:11:20.269 --> 02:11:25.269]  we could simply unite together as one and just say no to the tyrants.
[02:11:26.269 --> 02:11:33.269]  The answer to 1984 is 1776 reporting for info wars.
[02:11:33.269 --> 02:11:34.269]  This is Greg Reese.
[02:11:38.269 --> 02:11:41.269]  We're now well into the third hour here today.
[02:11:41.269 --> 02:11:43.269]  And I wanted to just say the cruise had a great job.
[02:11:43.269 --> 02:11:46.269]  I've been gone for a week and a half on the road is very stressful.
[02:11:46.269 --> 02:11:48.269]  We have a few technical difficulties,
[02:11:48.269 --> 02:11:50.269]  but that's special reporting to be seen anyway.
[02:11:50.269 --> 02:11:51.269]  So,
[02:11:51.269 --> 02:11:52.269]  um,
[02:11:52.269 --> 02:11:53.269]  it all works out in the end.
[02:11:53.269 --> 02:11:55.269]  I appreciate the crew putting up with me,
[02:11:55.269 --> 02:11:57.269]  a lot of stressful stuff going up,
[02:11:57.269 --> 02:11:58.269]  going on.
[02:11:58.269 --> 02:11:59.269]  So great job of the crew.
[02:11:59.269 --> 02:12:00.269]  Well,
[02:12:00.269 --> 02:12:02.269]  I wanted to get pastor Dave Scarlett back on the show,
[02:12:02.269 --> 02:12:03.269]  his glory.me.
[02:12:03.269 --> 02:12:04.269]  Uh,
[02:12:04.269 --> 02:12:07.269]  he reaches millions of millions of people every day with his glory ministry.
[02:12:07.269 --> 02:12:11.269]  And they felt led by the Lord to move to Texas in the last year to really focus
[02:12:11.269 --> 02:12:12.269]  on the border.
[02:12:12.269 --> 02:12:13.269]  So he's been down there a lot.
[02:12:13.269 --> 02:12:14.269]  They've made documentaries.
[02:12:14.269 --> 02:12:15.269]  They've had a bunch of special reports.
[02:12:15.269 --> 02:12:17.269]  They've aired some of those here.
[02:12:17.269 --> 02:12:18.269]  It's incredible footage.
[02:12:18.269 --> 02:12:19.269]  They've caught his glory.me,
[02:12:19.269 --> 02:12:20.269]  uh,
[02:12:20.269 --> 02:12:21.269]  is the URL,
[02:12:21.269 --> 02:12:22.269]  but it's great that,
[02:12:22.269 --> 02:12:23.269]  um,
[02:12:23.269 --> 02:12:24.269]  we got him on this week.
[02:12:24.269 --> 02:12:25.269]  We had an issue a few weeks ago,
[02:12:25.269 --> 02:12:27.269]  get him on for some stuff that came up with,
[02:12:27.269 --> 02:12:28.269]  with,
[02:12:28.269 --> 02:12:29.269]  um,
[02:12:29.269 --> 02:12:30.269]  myself that,
[02:12:30.269 --> 02:12:35.269]  that now you can come on and talk about all the latest developments that are
[02:12:35.269 --> 02:12:36.269]  coming out.
[02:12:36.269 --> 02:12:37.269]  The,
[02:12:37.269 --> 02:12:38.269]  the,
[02:12:38.269 --> 02:12:40.269]  the congressional reports confirming massive human trafficking,
[02:12:40.269 --> 02:12:44.269]  giving children to sex slavers and Obama.
[02:12:44.269 --> 02:12:45.269]  And that's who the new,
[02:12:45.269 --> 02:12:47.269]  the third administration of Obama,
[02:12:47.269 --> 02:12:48.269]  that's who controls Biden.
[02:12:48.269 --> 02:12:49.269]  The,
[02:12:49.269 --> 02:12:53.269]  the old Biden administration has said that they're not going to test the DNA
[02:12:53.269 --> 02:12:54.269]  of children.
[02:12:54.269 --> 02:12:55.269]  They're not going to check IDs.
[02:12:55.269 --> 02:12:56.269]  Whoever has a child,
[02:12:56.269 --> 02:12:57.269]  they've got them.
[02:12:57.269 --> 02:12:58.269]  They can just disappear.
[02:12:58.269 --> 02:13:03.269]  That is next level criminal to make sure these are faceless,
[02:13:03.269 --> 02:13:06.269]  soulless people in the globalist view who can be exploited.
[02:13:06.269 --> 02:13:07.269]  However,
[02:13:07.269 --> 02:13:08.269]  the new world war wants.
[02:13:08.269 --> 02:13:09.269]  And that ties into this video.
[02:13:09.269 --> 02:13:11.269]  And I want to ask pastor Scarlett about this,
[02:13:11.269 --> 02:13:12.269]  uh,
[02:13:12.269 --> 02:13:13.269]  Dave Scarlett,
[02:13:13.269 --> 02:13:14.269]  who's going to be here in just a minute.
[02:13:14.269 --> 02:13:15.269]  This is an info wars.com article.
[02:13:15.269 --> 02:13:16.269]  It's obviously a big story.
[02:13:16.269 --> 02:13:21.269]  We know there's a lot of news coming out of Ukraine about organ
[02:13:21.269 --> 02:13:22.269]  trafficking,
[02:13:22.269 --> 02:13:23.269]  uh,
[02:13:23.269 --> 02:13:24.269]  with the soldiers,
[02:13:24.269 --> 02:13:25.269]  the wounded soldiers,
[02:13:25.269 --> 02:13:26.269]  the dead soldiers,
[02:13:26.269 --> 02:13:29.269]  but also women and children charity worker caught trying to sell baby to
[02:13:29.269 --> 02:13:31.269]  organ harvesters in Ukraine.
[02:13:31.269 --> 02:13:33.269]  After paying the mother a thousand dollars,
[02:13:33.269 --> 02:13:35.269]  the mother believed the child was going to freedom and safety and that he
[02:13:35.269 --> 02:13:38.269]  would bring her later to Germany or Poland.
[02:13:38.269 --> 02:13:42.269]  And so he was about to sell the baby for $25,000 to have its organs
[02:13:43.269 --> 02:13:44.269]  harvested.
[02:13:44.269 --> 02:13:45.269]  Now you can say,
[02:13:45.269 --> 02:13:46.269]  is this real?
[02:13:46.269 --> 02:13:47.269]  Is this true?
[02:13:47.269 --> 02:13:48.269]  They're saying it is.
[02:13:48.269 --> 02:13:51.269]  They've signed a law in California and Virginia to keep babies alive for 20
[02:13:51.269 --> 02:13:54.269]  plus days and take their organs after they've been born because they can keep
[02:13:54.269 --> 02:13:55.269]  them alive down,
[02:13:55.269 --> 02:13:57.269]  get more money for every Oregon.
[02:13:57.269 --> 02:13:58.269]  So yes,
[02:13:58.269 --> 02:13:59.269]  this goes on.
[02:13:59.269 --> 02:14:00.269]  Yes,
[02:14:00.269 --> 02:14:01.269]  this is real.
[02:14:01.269 --> 02:14:02.269]  Yes,
[02:14:02.269 --> 02:14:03.269]  it's happening.
[02:14:03.269 --> 02:14:04.269]  So here's a quick clip of that.
[02:14:04.269 --> 02:14:05.269]  Uh,
[02:14:05.269 --> 02:14:07.269]  and then we'll go to pastor Dave to get his take on it.
[02:14:07.269 --> 02:14:08.269]  Here it is.
[02:14:08.269 --> 02:14:12.269]  Okay.
[02:14:38.269 --> 02:14:46.469]  Authorities don't trust anybody, and people came here because the students bothered them.
[02:14:47.330 --> 02:14:49.690]  Now it's all clear and the authorities agreed to stop the armed robberies
[02:14:49.690 --> 02:14:51.670]  because it will make it difficult for the students to pay their tuition fees.
[02:14:51.670 --> 02:14:53.230]  The results, though, show that one 80% truth.
[02:14:53.889 --> 02:14:59.070]  Yesterday I had a conversation with one student.
[02:14:59.070 --> 02:15:00.670]  When did they have the last conversation?
[02:15:00.670 --> 02:15:01.769]  Yesterday.
[02:15:01.769 --> 02:15:05.230]  What did he say?
[02:15:05.230 --> 02:15:07.830]  Well, he said we need aGRP license but he doesn't have one.
[02:15:07.830 --> 02:15:15.030]  Kamchatka is still alive but migrants continue to demand more quiero a regresar a Kamchatka
[02:15:15.030 --> 02:15:44.389]  in the epicenter.
[02:15:44.389 --> 02:15:46.710]  say, oh, that's just more Ukrainian propaganda.
[02:15:46.710 --> 02:15:47.549]  Well, they're not even claiming
[02:15:47.549 --> 02:15:49.070]  that the Russians were trying to do this.
[02:15:49.070 --> 02:15:51.549]  They're saying an aid worker,
[02:15:51.549 --> 02:15:52.910]  who's an official aid worker was doing this.
[02:15:52.910 --> 02:15:56.549]  We know that human trafficking is bigger than gambling,
[02:15:56.549 --> 02:15:57.389]  bigger than drugs.
[02:15:57.389 --> 02:15:58.590]  It is the commodity.
[02:15:58.590 --> 02:16:02.070]  And naive people that work regular jobs
[02:16:03.549 --> 02:16:05.549]  don't believe this is happening, but it is going on.
[02:16:05.549 --> 02:16:09.590]  And Pastor Dave Scarlett has really been fighting this
[02:16:09.590 --> 02:16:12.549]  for a while, and he's been all over the Texas,
[02:16:12.549 --> 02:16:13.990]  Arizona, you name it, border.
[02:16:14.030 --> 02:16:14.870]  It's glory.me.
[02:16:14.870 --> 02:16:15.830]  Thank you so much for joining us, sir.
[02:16:15.830 --> 02:16:17.870]  We had a technical difficulty, got you on late.
[02:16:17.870 --> 02:16:21.190]  But just your view on this, what's developing,
[02:16:21.190 --> 02:16:24.269]  and what's gonna happen as the world awakens
[02:16:24.269 --> 02:16:26.429]  to what's really happening.
[02:16:26.429 --> 02:16:28.269]  Yeah, first of all, thank you for having me, Alex,
[02:16:28.269 --> 02:16:30.070]  and thank you for standing up for truth.
[02:16:30.070 --> 02:16:33.189]  You've been a pioneer of the truth movement.
[02:16:33.189 --> 02:16:35.750]  What we're seeing, what we saw in Texas,
[02:16:35.750 --> 02:16:37.710]  and what we saw in Arizona,
[02:16:37.710 --> 02:16:40.470]  now with more public information coming out,
[02:16:40.470 --> 02:16:43.430]  even from Congress, saying that the United States government
[02:16:43.910 --> 02:16:45.590]  is the largest human trafficker out there.
[02:16:45.590 --> 02:16:48.550]  That was a big statement to make about three weeks ago.
[02:16:48.550 --> 02:16:50.390]  We saw that firsthand in Arizona.
[02:16:50.390 --> 02:16:53.789]  We now know that there are nonprofits
[02:16:53.789 --> 02:16:56.350]  that are taking money from the United States government
[02:16:56.350 --> 02:16:59.230]  and smuggling humans, including children,
[02:16:59.230 --> 02:17:00.910]  all through the United States.
[02:17:00.910 --> 02:17:03.029]  And that includes some of the largest
[02:17:03.029 --> 02:17:05.230]  church charities as well.
[02:17:05.230 --> 02:17:06.990]  And it is absolutely heartbreaking
[02:17:06.990 --> 02:17:08.550]  because this is the worst of the worst
[02:17:08.550 --> 02:17:10.310]  when you mess with God's children.
[02:17:11.200 --> 02:17:17.920]  Pastor, you always pause and let me run on, but you've been all over the border, you've
[02:17:17.920 --> 02:17:21.200]  made films on this, you were doing it before you moved to Texas, but you've been moved
[02:17:21.200 --> 02:17:25.640]  to move to Texas for the epicenter of the new UN-sponsored program.
[02:17:25.640 --> 02:17:27.920]  Describe what you've seen and get back into what you just mentioned.
[02:17:27.920 --> 02:17:32.400]  Congress now officially saying, yes, the U.S. government now is basically running the human
[02:17:32.400 --> 02:17:35.200]  trafficking under, under O'Biden.
[02:17:35.200 --> 02:17:38.360]  Exactly, under O'Biden, and that's exactly right.
[02:17:38.360 --> 02:17:40.720]  Obama is still the puppet behind Biden.
[02:17:40.720 --> 02:17:44.960]  He's the one making the calls, and that's shocking just to hear that piece of information
[02:17:44.960 --> 02:17:50.000]  by itself, that the U.S. government is the largest trafficker of humans.
[02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:54.480]  And then again, going deeper into this, we see that this is how, we see how they're doing
[02:17:54.480 --> 02:17:55.480]  it.
[02:17:55.480 --> 02:17:56.480]  We went down to Arizona.
[02:17:56.480 --> 02:17:59.920]  I spent a day with Sheriff Lamb and Sheriff Daniel's team.
[02:17:59.920 --> 02:18:05.680]  We saw the smuggling coming across, the drugs coming across, the young people that are of
[02:18:05.680 --> 02:18:10.160]  military age coming across our border, and the question you always ask yourself, why would
[02:18:10.160 --> 02:18:12.400]  they allow these, these, these kids?
[02:18:12.400 --> 02:18:17.600]  And I would say 80% of the kids that I saw at the border were not connected to the family.
[02:18:17.600 --> 02:18:19.640]  They acted like they were part of the family.
[02:18:19.640 --> 02:18:22.440]  They're also a war on religion as well.
[02:18:22.440 --> 02:18:26.640]  What we're finding is when they come to the border, they're taking their rosaries off,
[02:18:26.640 --> 02:18:29.560]  making them keep their Bibles there because they don't, they understand.
[02:18:29.560 --> 02:18:33.160]  I wondered, I asked this question to the sheriffs, why are they making them leave their
[02:18:33.160 --> 02:18:34.160]  Bibles behind?
[02:18:34.160 --> 02:18:39.560]  Because they want no evidence of the true faith, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
[02:18:39.560 --> 02:18:43.880]  because that is truly the only light in this world of darkness as the dark is getting darker
[02:18:43.880 --> 02:18:45.400]  and darker before the light.
[02:18:45.400 --> 02:18:52.200]  Well, it's just like all over the world, governments unified under the UN directive would not let
[02:18:52.200 --> 02:18:53.200]  churches open.
[02:18:53.200 --> 02:18:59.080]  I mean, they were arresting just, just last year, even this year, churches in, in provinces
[02:18:59.080 --> 02:19:01.080]  in Canada, they're still arresting.
[02:19:01.080 --> 02:19:06.320]  Churches are still supposed to be closed, but topless bars were open two years ago.
[02:19:06.320 --> 02:19:07.520]  Absolutely.
[02:19:07.520 --> 02:19:09.840]  It's, it's, it's a, it's a dark world we live in.
[02:19:09.840 --> 02:19:14.840]  As you saw in your opening with, it's a uniparty system that is a cabal system.
[02:19:14.840 --> 02:19:17.360]  And it truly is not Republican or Democrat.
[02:19:17.360 --> 02:19:19.480]  It is light versus dark.
[02:19:19.480 --> 02:19:23.040]  And if we, the people don't wake up to the fundamental constitution of the United States
[02:19:23.040 --> 02:19:28.120]  of America, that we were established under Judeo-Christian values and putting the most
[02:19:28.120 --> 02:19:30.560]  high God back in place, it's going to cave us in.
[02:19:30.560 --> 02:19:31.600]  But you know what?
[02:19:31.600 --> 02:19:36.520]  There's a remnant, Alex, and that remnant is rising and you're going to see the greatest
[02:19:36.520 --> 02:19:38.560]  light to dark and the history of the world.
[02:19:38.560 --> 02:19:40.360]  And we're going to see the greatest revival.
[02:19:40.360 --> 02:19:42.720]  That's why I was moved to move to Texas.
[02:19:42.720 --> 02:19:45.080]  We're doing tent revivals in all 50 states.
[02:19:45.080 --> 02:19:46.080]  That's what we need to do.
[02:19:46.080 --> 02:19:50.480]  We need to repent, seek the Lord's face and the revival is coming.
[02:19:50.480 --> 02:19:53.720]  Let me ask you a question.
[02:19:53.720 --> 02:19:56.360]  You know, I understand why Israel is there.
[02:19:56.360 --> 02:20:01.120]  I understand that that's where the Jewish people came from and I'm not an enemy of Israel.
[02:20:01.120 --> 02:20:03.160]  I want Jews to come to Christ.
[02:20:03.160 --> 02:20:04.640]  I think Jews are amazing people.
[02:20:04.640 --> 02:20:05.640]  There's good Jews.
[02:20:05.760 --> 02:20:06.760]  There's bad Jews.
[02:20:06.760 --> 02:20:07.760]  There's good Germans.
[02:20:07.760 --> 02:20:08.760]  There's bad Germans.
[02:20:08.760 --> 02:20:09.760]  There's good Japanese.
[02:20:09.760 --> 02:20:10.760]  There's bad Japanese.
[02:20:10.760 --> 02:20:11.760]  You know, there's good Native Americans.
[02:20:11.760 --> 02:20:12.760]  There's bad Native Americans.
[02:20:12.760 --> 02:20:17.840]  But there is a big movement obviously called Christian Zionism, whatever you want, with
[02:20:17.840 --> 02:20:22.120]  Pastor Hagee and many others that, you know, love Shalom and all that.
[02:20:22.120 --> 02:20:27.920]  And it's true that it is Judeo-Christian, you know, it's the Abrahamic thing, Old Testament,
[02:20:27.920 --> 02:20:28.920]  New Testament.
[02:20:28.920 --> 02:20:29.920]  It comes out of that.
[02:20:29.920 --> 02:20:33.840]  We're so blessed, you know, by that and the blessings that were given to the Jewish people
[02:20:33.840 --> 02:20:40.560]  by God and it goes back to, you know, back to Noah and Adam and just right through King
[02:20:40.560 --> 02:20:47.680]  David and Solomon and, of course, then people like Moses and right through into John the
[02:20:47.680 --> 02:20:48.680]  Baptist and Christ.
[02:20:48.680 --> 02:20:49.680]  It's a beautiful thing.
[02:20:49.680 --> 02:20:50.680]  It's a wonderful thing.
[02:20:50.680 --> 02:20:51.680]  I don't deny that.
[02:20:51.680 --> 02:20:52.680]  I'm proud of that.
[02:20:52.680 --> 02:20:58.640]  But Israel's been cracking down more than ever, just like Saudi Arabia would, on Christians
[02:20:58.640 --> 02:21:01.840]  being able to proselytize and teach and preach in Israel.
[02:21:01.840 --> 02:21:02.840]  Absolutely.
[02:21:02.840 --> 02:21:05.920]  And I know Rodney R. Brown, a pastor I know, he's been there in the Knesset and said,
[02:21:05.920 --> 02:21:10.400]  why are you doing this when Christians give so much money to Israel and, you know, do
[02:21:10.400 --> 02:21:11.680]  so much for what's happening in Israel?
[02:21:11.680 --> 02:21:16.240]  So there's really a paradoxical view here where a lot of Jews think there's been some
[02:21:16.240 --> 02:21:20.120]  issues with the Catholic Church and Jews in the past, which isn't there now, that Christians
[02:21:20.120 --> 02:21:25.680]  just because some popes in the past, you know, were anti-Semitic, well, how does that fall
[02:21:25.680 --> 02:21:26.680]  onto Protestants?
[02:21:26.680 --> 02:21:27.680]  How does that fall onto you?
[02:21:27.680 --> 02:21:33.000]  Because I understand Israel's key to revelation, what's going to happen there, abomination,
[02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:34.000]  desolation.
[02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:36.000]  You go to Scripture, if you like.
[02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:40.320]  So I want to be friends with the people of Israel, and I see the people of Israel not
[02:21:40.320 --> 02:21:41.600]  getting a free pass on the shots.
[02:21:41.600 --> 02:21:44.800]  They were one of the most oppressed, injected, controlled peoples.
[02:21:44.800 --> 02:21:48.320]  We see them following globalist orders, just like what Americans did.
[02:21:48.320 --> 02:21:51.760]  If I see them just like Americans, I see them as our brothers.
[02:21:51.760 --> 02:21:59.120]  At the same time, there's this thing of they'll take the Christian money, but then at the
[02:21:59.120 --> 02:22:03.520]  same time, the ADL comes out and says Christians are the main enemy, which we know are leftists
[02:22:03.520 --> 02:22:06.600]  and the ADL wants the Muslims to take over Israel, basically.
[02:22:06.600 --> 02:22:08.960]  So it's a really bizarre thing going on.
[02:22:08.960 --> 02:22:15.280]  I kind of did a rant there, but how would you quantify your answer to what I just said?
[02:22:15.280 --> 02:22:19.160]  Civil war going on in Israel, much like what's going on in the United States of America,
[02:22:19.400 --> 02:22:22.520]  may be even more intense because of the soul of Israel.
[02:22:22.520 --> 02:22:27.720]  As you mentioned, there's the piece of the Israelis that want the Arabs to become part
[02:22:27.720 --> 02:22:28.280]  of the government.
[02:22:28.280 --> 02:22:30.040]  They were part of the last government.
[02:22:30.040 --> 02:22:35.240]  And then you've had riots in the streets, literally, in Israel the last month or so.
[02:22:35.240 --> 02:22:41.880]  A lot of that has come from the extreme religious sect of the Orthodox, where they want to lock
[02:22:41.880 --> 02:22:42.520]  up Christians.
[02:22:42.520 --> 02:22:46.040]  They don't want Christians to be able to preach the gospel in Jerusalem.
[02:22:46.120 --> 02:22:50.520]  That's no different than the times of Jesus and the religious spirit of the Pharisees
[02:22:50.520 --> 02:22:51.720]  and the Sadducees.
[02:22:51.720 --> 02:22:55.960]  We're living in that battle because at the end of the day, it's always about the light
[02:22:55.960 --> 02:22:58.360]  of the Most High God.
[02:22:59.530 --> 02:23:02.530]  Pastor, I'm listening to you right now.
[02:23:02.530 --> 02:23:07.530]  Sorry, they just had a person walk in here with another thing of coffee at the hotel I'm broadcasting from.
[02:23:07.530 --> 02:23:10.530]  I was distracted, but you're dead on. Continue, because you're so polite.
[02:23:10.530 --> 02:23:13.530]  I'm listening to you, and you stop. Keep rolling out what's happening.
[02:23:13.530 --> 02:23:16.530]  Yeah, so that's exactly what's happening.
[02:23:16.530 --> 02:23:20.530]  We love biblical Israel. I always have to stress that.
[02:23:20.530 --> 02:23:24.530]  I'm from the tribe of Judah myself. I have Jewish blood in me.
[02:23:24.530 --> 02:23:27.530]  But it doesn't mean, as you said, all Jewish people are not good.
[02:23:27.530 --> 02:23:29.530]  All Americans are not good. All Germans are not good.
[02:23:29.530 --> 02:23:33.530]  It's only the remnant. And when you see the Bible, over and over and over,
[02:23:33.530 --> 02:23:35.530]  God is always looking for that remnant.
[02:23:35.530 --> 02:23:39.530]  And that remnant are the ones that stayed true to his precepts and commandments.
[02:23:39.530 --> 02:23:44.530]  And for anybody that's preaching against or telling you that the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
[02:23:44.530 --> 02:23:48.530]  wants to kill somebody else, that's not of the Most High God.
[02:23:48.530 --> 02:23:53.530]  And they're taking that religious spirit, and they're twisting it like no other time before.
[02:23:53.530 --> 02:23:55.530]  And that's why you literally have riots.
[02:23:55.530 --> 02:24:00.530]  The last time I was on the Temple Mount in February, there was a literal riot on the Temple Mount.
[02:24:00.530 --> 02:24:04.530]  And it wasn't the extreme Muslims that were doing it this time.
[02:24:04.530 --> 02:24:09.530]  It was the extreme Jewish religious sect that were coming against the Christians
[02:24:09.530 --> 02:24:11.530]  and coming against the Muslims.
[02:24:11.530 --> 02:24:15.530]  And it's an absolute mess, and the only way out of this is truth.
[02:24:15.530 --> 02:24:20.530]  The good news is my connections in Israel, these Israeli generals and doctors
[02:24:20.530 --> 02:24:24.530]  that you know in the United States of America that are Jewish ambassadors
[02:24:24.530 --> 02:24:26.530]  are all asking the same question.
[02:24:26.530 --> 02:24:28.530]  Who is this Messiah?
[02:24:28.530 --> 02:24:33.530]  So this is the Ezekiel 37 time frame we're in, because the Jewish people are looking.
[02:24:33.530 --> 02:24:37.530]  The hardened of the eyes, or the scales of the eyes that the Apostle Paul talks about
[02:24:37.530 --> 02:24:40.530]  are starting to come off, and they're seeking for the real truth.
[02:24:40.530 --> 02:24:44.530]  The real truth is who is the Son of the Most High God?
[02:24:44.530 --> 02:24:46.530]  Who is this Messiah, Yeshua Messiah?
[02:24:46.530 --> 02:24:48.530]  And they're coming in record numbers.
[02:24:48.530 --> 02:24:54.530]  So even though it looks very dark, we're on a tip of light breaking open
[02:24:54.530 --> 02:24:59.530]  and people coming to Christ from places you would never imagine in our lifetime.
[02:24:59.530 --> 02:25:02.530]  The Jewish people, Muslims are coming to Christ with visions and dreams
[02:25:02.530 --> 02:25:05.530]  like no other time in the history of the Muslim faith.
[02:25:05.530 --> 02:25:09.530]  It's happening. I know so many secular people that are having visions of Christ.
[02:25:09.530 --> 02:25:12.530]  I can't say the names. It's like super prominent people.
[02:25:12.530 --> 02:25:15.530]  And you're right, it's Jews, it's Muslims, it's people that weren't really Christian.
[02:25:15.530 --> 02:25:17.530]  What is happening?
[02:25:18.530 --> 02:25:22.530]  It's the Ezekiel 37. It's the Great Awakening.
[02:25:22.530 --> 02:25:25.530]  And if this wouldn't have happened the last three and a half years
[02:25:25.530 --> 02:25:29.530]  of being locked down, shut down, imprisonment, the corruption of the government,
[02:25:29.530 --> 02:25:32.530]  we'd be still asleep at the wheel.
[02:25:32.530 --> 02:25:38.530]  But by the grace of God, He's woke us up to see what is the most important things in our lives.
[02:25:38.530 --> 02:25:41.530]  It's not how high we get up the ladder in the corporate world,
[02:25:41.530 --> 02:25:43.530]  it's what do we do for the gift of Him.
[02:25:43.530 --> 02:25:46.530]  What do we do to accept Him as Lord of our life?
[02:25:46.530 --> 02:25:49.530]  And once we accept Him, what are you going to do with that gift?
[02:25:49.530 --> 02:25:52.530]  Are you going to bring people in for His purpose and His glory?
[02:25:52.530 --> 02:25:55.530]  And He's opening up people like no other time in the history.
[02:25:55.530 --> 02:25:59.530]  We're seeing signs and wonders, miracles, visions and dreams,
[02:25:59.530 --> 02:26:04.530]  and the least likely, I've had two imams give their life to Christ in the last year.
[02:26:05.530 --> 02:26:08.530]  Wow, tell us about that. That's fascinating.
[02:26:08.530 --> 02:26:12.530]  Well, it starts with, when you talk to somebody of another faith,
[02:26:12.530 --> 02:26:15.530]  the only way to talk to them is at their level.
[02:26:15.530 --> 02:26:18.530]  If you're talking to a Jewish person, you have to talk to them from the Old Testament.
[02:26:18.530 --> 02:26:20.530]  Otherwise, they're not going to listen to you.
[02:26:20.530 --> 02:26:24.530]  Same with the Qur'an. The Lord had me study the Qur'an a few years ago.
[02:26:24.530 --> 02:26:30.530]  And the reason I studied the Qur'an is to see where the pieces that fit the Bible to plant seeds.
[02:26:30.530 --> 02:26:32.530]  And by planting those seeds of the Old Testament,
[02:26:32.530 --> 02:26:36.530]  and planting the seeds of what they believe the gospel is being a holy book,
[02:26:36.530 --> 02:26:39.530]  you just continue to plant the seeds from the Qur'an,
[02:26:39.530 --> 02:26:42.530]  and then that allows it to blossom, and you pray for them,
[02:26:42.530 --> 02:26:45.530]  that the Holy Spirit will shine upon them, that they'll have dreams and visions.
[02:26:45.530 --> 02:26:48.530]  And that is exactly what's happening.
[02:26:48.530 --> 02:26:52.530]  One of the imams, we have like 2.2 million followers on Facebook,
[02:26:52.530 --> 02:26:55.530]  gave his life to Christ on Facebook.
[02:26:55.530 --> 02:26:59.530]  And that means instant death, especially for an imam.
[02:27:00.530 --> 02:27:03.530]  Well, that's right. And people ask why I'm so Christian.
[02:27:03.530 --> 02:27:07.530]  I've had dreams and visions. I mean, it's happening.
[02:27:08.530 --> 02:27:12.530]  The most intense dreams are unlike any other dreams where I'm with God,
[02:27:12.530 --> 02:27:16.530]  and I'm being told to do this, and I know the future.
[02:27:16.530 --> 02:27:19.530]  I mean, all the time, it's like, watch, this is going to happen.
[02:27:19.530 --> 02:27:22.530]  You know this is real. It's not your brain going through some war game.
[02:27:22.530 --> 02:27:25.530]  Most of your dreams are that. There's other dreams that are next level.
[02:27:25.530 --> 02:27:28.530]  And I have these dreams. I know God's real. It's incredible.
[02:27:29.530 --> 02:27:33.530]  It's amazing. And once you know that He's real, and you know that He is sovereign,
[02:27:33.530 --> 02:27:37.530]  and you know that He's the only way you can get that true peace in the life and the world,
[02:27:37.530 --> 02:27:41.530]  you're comfortable. That's one of the things I get asked all the time.
[02:27:41.530 --> 02:27:45.530]  How can the world be melting down, Dave, and you're not worried about it?
[02:27:45.530 --> 02:27:48.530]  Because I know God has it, and I'm just a servant following His direction
[02:27:48.530 --> 02:27:51.530]  for His purpose and His glory, and I'm going to finish the race
[02:27:51.530 --> 02:27:54.530]  exactly the way the Apostle Paul told us to.
[02:27:54.530 --> 02:27:58.530]  And we've got a lot of souls to win over. We have a lot of souls to plant the seed.
[02:27:58.530 --> 02:28:01.530]  This is the great harvest that the Scripture talks about,
[02:28:01.530 --> 02:28:06.530]  and we are just warming up for this. So it's time for all Christians to lean in
[02:28:06.530 --> 02:28:10.530]  and spread the Gospel from east to west, to north to south, to every creature.
[02:28:11.530 --> 02:28:14.530]  All right. I want to talk about President Trump, the indictments, the new developments,
[02:28:14.530 --> 02:28:17.530]  the Supreme Court rulings with you. And you're a great guest,
[02:28:17.530 --> 02:28:21.530]  because I love watching your show on TV. But you're so nice when you're on my show,
[02:28:21.530 --> 02:28:24.530]  you don't really talk. So I'm like, why have Dave on? He doesn't talk.
[02:28:24.530 --> 02:28:27.530]  But once you get going, you're one of the best guests. So I'm glad you're here.
[02:28:27.530 --> 02:28:30.530]  What a smart guy. I can't wait to talk to Pastor Dave Scarnell on the other side.
[02:28:30.530 --> 02:28:34.530]  Be sure and check out his website and bookmark it. It's HisGlory.me.

[02:29:15.530 --> 02:29:20.530]  And the answer is different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different people.
[02:29:20.530 --> 02:29:24.530]  So one person might like this coffee. Another person likes that coffee.
[02:29:24.530 --> 02:29:27.530]  That's how our bodies work. They're all very diverse.

[02:31:22.530 --> 02:31:27.530]  But the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is RainForce.
[02:31:27.530 --> 02:31:31.530]  I'll take RainForce in the morning right before I go to my computer.

[02:31:57.530 --> 02:32:03.530]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mugshot because they knew that that would help Trump.
[02:32:03.530 --> 02:32:05.530]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[02:32:05.530 --> 02:32:08.530]  We were waiting for the mugshot. We learned today they wouldn't have it.
[02:32:08.530 --> 02:32:14.530]  So we've made our own. And it says political prisoner with an image of President Trump.
[02:32:14.530 --> 02:32:19.530]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas. It will be shipping out to you in one week.
[02:32:19.530 --> 02:32:25.530]  Political prisoner with Trump on the front there in a mugshot jail background.

[02:32:30.530 --> 02:32:33.530]  We also have Alex Jones for president. No, I'm not running for president.
[02:32:33.530 --> 02:32:38.530]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt. Red, white and blue. Alex Jones for president.

[02:33:06.760 --> 02:33:36.080]  I noticed that Antifa has been posting about me being here in Omaha, that I'm vacationing
[02:33:36.080 --> 02:33:37.080]  in Omaha.
[02:33:37.080 --> 02:33:41.560]  No, I'm here visiting my mother's father, who's in the hospital after a heart issue.
[02:33:41.560 --> 02:33:42.560]  It's just...
[02:33:42.560 --> 02:33:43.560]  What'd I say?
[02:33:43.560 --> 02:33:44.560]  You said mother's.
[02:33:44.560 --> 02:33:45.560]  My mother's father.
[02:33:45.560 --> 02:33:46.560]  No, he's dead.
[02:33:46.560 --> 02:33:47.560]  My mother's father's dead.
[02:33:47.560 --> 02:33:48.560]  My wife's father.
[02:33:48.560 --> 02:33:49.560]  Anyways, it's just ridiculous with these people.
[02:33:49.560 --> 02:33:50.560]  That's my wife's father.
[02:33:50.560 --> 02:33:51.560]  My mother's father, he's been dead for a long time.
[02:33:51.560 --> 02:33:52.560]  Great guy.
[02:33:52.560 --> 02:33:53.560]  That was William Hammond.
[02:33:53.560 --> 02:33:54.560]  But, you know, here we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:33:54.560 --> 02:33:55.560]  We've got Pastor Dave Scarlett with us riding shotgun, making some great points.
[02:33:55.560 --> 02:34:07.680]  I was, Sunday night, we had a four-hour packed event.
[02:34:07.680 --> 02:34:09.680]  Thousands of people showed up.
[02:34:09.680 --> 02:34:13.280]  And thank goodness they had a big jumbotron outside in a big outside church for all the
[02:34:13.280 --> 02:34:15.640]  thousands that couldn't get in.
[02:34:15.640 --> 02:34:17.680]  And a guy got up, brought up Nick Fuentes.
[02:34:17.680 --> 02:34:22.280]  You know, Nick's a handsome guy, smart guy, intelligent guy.
[02:34:22.280 --> 02:34:25.800]  He points out there's a war on white people and that white people are being discriminated
[02:34:25.800 --> 02:34:26.800]  against.
[02:34:26.800 --> 02:34:27.800]  And I think it's fine to say that.
[02:34:27.800 --> 02:34:30.600]  White folks should stand up if they're being attacked.
[02:34:30.600 --> 02:34:34.800]  But when him and Kanye West showed up at my studio and, you know, and he agreed that Hitler
[02:34:34.800 --> 02:34:37.000]  is a good guy, I disagree with that.
[02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:41.800]  Just because there's corruption on the other side doesn't, in my view, mean Hitler's bad.
[02:34:41.800 --> 02:34:46.840]  And then when I pointed out that both my grandfathers were in World War II and one of my grandfathers,
[02:34:46.840 --> 02:34:51.600]  after he did his Army Air Corps work, was in Europe and saw the dead bodies and the piles
[02:34:51.600 --> 02:34:55.040]  of dead bodies and told my dad about it, didn't really tell me about it, I heard it
[02:34:55.040 --> 02:34:56.040]  directly from my grandfather.
[02:34:56.040 --> 02:35:00.040]  And when I said, well, my grandfather saw it, well, your grandfather's deceived.
[02:35:00.040 --> 02:35:02.960]  Well, that's my grandfather.
[02:35:02.960 --> 02:35:03.960]  That's not taken out of hand.
[02:35:03.960 --> 02:35:09.320]  So this obsession with Hitler 80 years ago and all this is mentally ill.
[02:35:09.320 --> 02:35:12.040]  And so a guy gets up and he says, you've taken down his channel.
[02:35:12.040 --> 02:35:13.040]  So I've made some calls.
[02:35:13.040 --> 02:35:14.560]  I said, is this channel taking off?
[02:35:14.560 --> 02:35:17.040]  And they said, no, he didn't post for a year.
[02:35:17.040 --> 02:35:20.640]  So there's some program where it's basically taking off the front page.
[02:35:20.680 --> 02:35:23.760]  And I'm going to say this, we'll give Nick Flayntest his channel.
[02:35:23.760 --> 02:35:27.120]  He's not doing anything illegal.
[02:35:27.120 --> 02:35:31.320]  And I disagree with some of what he has to say, but I want Nick to come on the show.
[02:35:31.320 --> 02:35:35.280]  I want Nick to have a debate with me about whatever his issues are with me.
[02:35:35.280 --> 02:35:41.280]  But the guy gets up, and we'll go back to Pastor Scarlett, and he says, Nick Flayntest
[02:35:41.280 --> 02:35:44.240]  says, I don't know if this is true, the guy saying it, I guess he said it on the show
[02:35:44.240 --> 02:35:49.640]  supposedly, but I don't just take what people say, you know, it's true, I don't know yet.
[02:35:49.640 --> 02:35:53.000]  He says that you said to him attacking the Jews is a dead end.
[02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:58.200]  Well, I said that on air, I don't want to attack any group, I want a big tent for freedom.
[02:35:58.200 --> 02:36:01.480]  They want to divide and conquer us, we need to unify against the poison shots and the new
[02:36:01.480 --> 02:36:05.600]  world order and the human trafficking and the open borders and, you know, the pedophilia
[02:36:05.600 --> 02:36:06.600]  and all of it.
[02:36:06.600 --> 02:36:09.720]  I'm like, I don't know if I said that behind the scenes, but I say that on air to him.
[02:36:09.720 --> 02:36:14.000]  So the guy first says, well, you didn't censor him, but you told him not to talk about, no,
[02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:16.440]  I didn't tell him not to talk about stuff.
[02:36:16.440 --> 02:36:19.640]  But I do think I probably did say it's a dead end.
[02:36:19.640 --> 02:36:23.240]  Then the guy comes back and says, so you did censor him.
[02:36:23.240 --> 02:36:26.680]  So it's this weirdness that goes on.
[02:36:26.680 --> 02:36:29.960]  But then I started preaching and talking about what the real problem is.
[02:36:29.960 --> 02:36:35.360]  So there's this viral clip, and I want to play it here.
[02:36:35.360 --> 02:36:40.640]  I am not going to be divided on the people that call me and say the black people are
[02:36:40.640 --> 02:36:44.280]  the problem, or this is the problem, or the Jews are the problem.
[02:36:44.280 --> 02:36:45.280]  There are good Jews.
[02:36:45.280 --> 02:36:46.280]  There are bad Jews.
[02:36:46.280 --> 02:36:47.280]  There are good Catholics.
[02:36:47.280 --> 02:36:48.280]  There are bad Catholics.
[02:36:48.280 --> 02:36:51.280]  My job is to expose the poison shots and the sex trafficking and the new world order and
[02:36:51.280 --> 02:36:52.280]  the nuclear war.
[02:36:52.280 --> 02:36:53.280]  I want the Muslims.
[02:36:53.280 --> 02:36:54.280]  I want the Jews.
[02:36:54.280 --> 02:36:55.280]  I want the Catholics.
[02:36:55.280 --> 02:36:56.280]  I want everybody to find Jesus.
[02:36:56.280 --> 02:36:57.280]  And what I stand for is 100% clear.
[02:36:57.280 --> 02:36:58.280]  That's what I stand for is Jesus Christ.
[02:36:58.280 --> 02:36:59.280]  That's what I stand for.
[02:36:59.280 --> 02:37:26.280]  I'll say on the air, our problem is not the Jews.
[02:37:26.280 --> 02:37:30.080]  Devil and the fact that we haven't accepted Jesus Christ
[02:37:36.040 --> 02:37:38.400]  Wow, I don't know how to follow that
[02:37:39.840 --> 02:37:43.240]  I hate the great up. I like to debate though. They got me to wake up. I have a great time
[02:37:43.240 --> 02:37:48.560]  I'm super exhausted now. I go five more hours. Oh my god, you're afraid to debate. Are you kidding?
[02:37:49.080 --> 02:37:51.080]  I don't wake up. So sorry
[02:37:51.080 --> 02:37:53.080]  They're gonna do that with you
[02:37:53.520 --> 02:37:55.520]  anyway
[02:37:55.920 --> 02:38:03.200]  None of that let's let's go back to Pastor Dave scarlet all the incredible border coverage. He's done his glory. Not me pastor
[02:38:03.200 --> 02:38:04.520]  I'm always interrupting
[02:38:04.520 --> 02:38:06.320]  We're gonna skip this network break coming up
[02:38:06.320 --> 02:38:11.880]  So you have more time and I'm gonna end this hour with an incredible thing from the River Church in Tampa
[02:38:12.380 --> 02:38:14.680]  Raymond Silliers where he sings
[02:38:15.600 --> 02:38:17.320]  That great song
[02:38:17.320 --> 02:38:23.680]  I'm proud to be an American. That's about 15-20 minutes. You've got the floor preach us a little sermon here right now
[02:38:23.680 --> 02:38:25.680]  I'm gonna turn my mic off. I'm gonna sit back
[02:38:26.280 --> 02:38:32.480]  I'm gonna listen to you the next job. Hell, we're shooting for the next 27 minutes. We're live on air
[02:38:32.480 --> 02:38:33.680]  So I'll come back last three or four
[02:38:33.680 --> 02:38:39.240]  You've got the floor to tell us about where the world is today and what you think's about to happen what you think we should
[02:38:39.240 --> 02:38:40.320]  do
[02:38:40.320 --> 02:38:46.120]  Well, it starts Alex is what you just said at the River Church. It's truly that the enemy is the devil
[02:38:46.120 --> 02:38:47.920]  This is the light of versus dark
[02:38:47.920 --> 02:38:51.480]  There's no ifs ands or buts and the evil wants it to divide
[02:38:51.480 --> 02:38:56.640]  Remember the scripture tells us if Satan's against himself his house will divide that wasn't a figure of speech
[02:38:56.640 --> 02:39:01.600]  It's truly is Satan's house is against this house and it will divide and it will collapse
[02:39:01.800 --> 02:39:06.960]  The only truth is the living Word of God and that's why we have to get rid of our little minor
[02:39:07.240 --> 02:39:13.740]  Differences it because you you you you're looking for the church to be a museum for Saints instead of a house
[02:39:13.980 --> 02:39:19.340]  Hospital for centers, we're all centers. We're all work in progress and we need the blood of the Lamb
[02:39:19.340 --> 02:39:23.860]  We need the blood of Jesus Christ to come into our heart our soul and our mind and save us for eternity
[02:39:23.860 --> 02:39:30.260]  That's the only way and the only way is to be united for his namesake as you said, there are some good Jews
[02:39:30.260 --> 02:39:34.100]  There's some bad Jews. There's good Americans and bad Americans good Germans and bad Germans
[02:39:34.260 --> 02:39:40.740]  But the only good as Jesus said who is good even Jesus when you walk to earth didn't couldn't even say he was good
[02:39:40.980 --> 02:39:42.300]  Until he took it to the cross
[02:39:42.300 --> 02:39:43.660]  we're not good and
[02:39:43.660 --> 02:39:50.060]  all the only way to be good is to get the blood of the Lamb to come in and be our Savior of the world and
[02:39:50.060 --> 02:39:55.420]  This is a time like no other time in the history of the world where there are panicking right now
[02:39:55.420 --> 02:40:00.740]  Satan knows his time is about up. So he's throwing everything he possibly can at us
[02:40:01.460 --> 02:40:04.580]  Division warfare of all kinds and you know
[02:40:04.580 --> 02:40:09.580]  Some of the church are falling for that some of the religious spirit of falling for that some that are on the fence are falling
[02:40:09.580 --> 02:40:14.140]  For that and they're starting to bicker over little things. We have to get rid of that bickering
[02:40:14.140 --> 02:40:19.260]  We have to get rid of the fence Satan owns the fence as Jesus said to the church of Laodicea
[02:40:19.260 --> 02:40:21.540]  You need the hot nor cold. You're lukewarm
[02:40:21.540 --> 02:40:26.740]  I vomit you out of my mouth the seventh of the church age is the church of Laodicea
[02:40:26.900 --> 02:40:27.940]  That's the church
[02:40:27.940 --> 02:40:31.820]  We're at in today and there's no better time to see where we're at
[02:40:31.940 --> 02:40:35.660]  When you see in the scripture in the book of Revelation in the church of Laodicea
[02:40:35.900 --> 02:40:39.540]  Jesus Christ is at the door of the church knocking in to get the church
[02:40:39.780 --> 02:40:44.380]  This church age is taking Jesus completely out of his church his body
[02:40:44.580 --> 02:40:49.460]  So what you're seeing around the world the Lord in the last three and a half years is testing the remnant
[02:40:49.460 --> 02:40:52.540]  Will the remnant stand up when they try to come shut you down?
[02:40:52.540 --> 02:40:56.780]  Are you gonna fold and conform like the rest of the government? Are you gonna do what the government tells you?
[02:40:56.780 --> 02:40:59.580]  Are you gonna do what I tell you to do and he says fear not
[02:41:00.580 --> 02:41:05.220]  Most high God and I am the way the truth in a life and if you put your trust in me
[02:41:05.220 --> 02:41:08.100]  You have complete Shalom and peace for eternity
[02:41:08.140 --> 02:41:13.780]  There is no other peace on the world that you can get no drug. No, no alcohol
[02:41:13.820 --> 02:41:17.580]  nothing can fill that gap that hole that each and every was
[02:41:17.740 --> 02:41:22.940]  Every one of us are born with because of the fall of Adam and Eve and the only way to fill that is to the love
[02:41:22.940 --> 02:41:28.300]  Of Jesus Christ, that's what they don't want to hear. That's why everything you hear today is hate hate hate
[02:41:28.940 --> 02:41:34.580]  What the world needs is love love love. We need to put our arms around this transgender generation
[02:41:34.580 --> 02:41:40.540]  They're confused. They're manipulated look no time in history when you get to a point in in human history
[02:41:40.820 --> 02:41:44.220]  When you see companies like Disney you see human trafficking
[02:41:44.220 --> 02:41:49.180]  You see the child sacrifices that are happening in the world today and they're putting it in your face
[02:41:49.220 --> 02:41:54.860]  We are in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah and worse, but that is telling you they're manipulating the child
[02:41:55.180 --> 02:41:59.680]  Satan hates the child and that's why he's going after the child Satan's number one
[02:42:00.120 --> 02:42:04.880]  What number one thing he wanted to do when he fell from from heaven was to attack mankind
[02:42:05.360 --> 02:42:10.640]  Because God did something amazing in the book of Genesis. He created us in his image
[02:42:10.640 --> 02:42:15.040]  We're the only creation in the image of the Most High God doesn't mean we're perfect
[02:42:15.040 --> 02:42:18.760]  The only way we become perfect is through the blood of the Lamb when he takes his home
[02:42:18.880 --> 02:42:24.000]  But Satan knew that he knew that the division was going to be it and he knew that the Lord of the father
[02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:27.640]  Huge heart for the children. So what's happening in the world today?
[02:42:28.280 --> 02:42:36.060]  Attacking the children that's right out of Satan's playbook and it's time for the great flip the great boomerang the great lot that the light
[02:42:36.320 --> 02:42:41.200]  To shine down from east to west and north to south it's about over and Satan knows it
[02:42:41.200 --> 02:42:46.000]  we're gonna have the greatest revival in the history of the world because people are waking up and saying you know what over the
[02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:51.200]  Course of this last three and a half years. I've been lied to I've been manipulated. I've been forced to take jabs
[02:42:51.200 --> 02:42:55.240]  I've been forced to do things against my free will I've been forced not to see loved ones
[02:42:55.240 --> 02:42:59.520]  I've had loved loved ones die. The border is out of control. We have a
[02:43:00.600 --> 02:43:03.800]  Person in the office of president. It's not even supposed to be there
[02:43:03.800 --> 02:43:09.640]  What else could happen and that's the way God is reaching you today and saying you see all the things that have happened in the last
[02:43:09.640 --> 02:43:14.640]  Three and a half years. What's it going to take for you to reach out your hand to me my child and say
[02:43:14.960 --> 02:43:18.120]  You're the only way you're the only way you are though
[02:43:18.120 --> 02:43:23.320]  You I am the only way meaning God the Father through the Son is the only way to keep bring peace to this world
[02:43:23.320 --> 02:43:27.960]  And once you do that once you accept the Lord Jesus Christ as Lord of your life
[02:43:28.120 --> 02:43:33.040]  You've just entered into eternity with the Most High God. Now. The question is what are you gonna do with it?
[02:43:33.040 --> 02:43:37.600]  What are you gonna do with that free gift? Are you gonna walk the walk and talk the talk of the Lord?
[02:43:37.600 --> 02:43:40.480]  Are you going to be a part of his remnant?
[02:43:40.480 --> 02:43:43.160]  Are you gonna be a part of his purpose for your life?
[02:43:43.160 --> 02:43:48.200]  Cuz each and every person watching this today if you accepted Jesus Christ as Lord of your life
[02:43:48.200 --> 02:43:49.840]  God has a purpose for you
[02:43:49.840 --> 02:43:53.360]  Are you gonna activate that purpose or are you part of the fence?
[02:43:53.800 --> 02:43:58.160]  Remember the fence has to go you either all in or you're all out
[02:43:58.160 --> 02:44:03.400]  There's no middle ground and we're seeing that in the last three and a half years and the Lord is using it
[02:44:03.400 --> 02:44:05.720]  It's turning things up through visions and dreams
[02:44:05.720 --> 02:44:10.720]  If you haven't had a supernatural experience with the Lord, you need to ask him to come into your heart today Lord
[02:44:11.320 --> 02:44:17.840]  Muslims are doing it Jewish people are doing it people who are non-believers of any other God are asking the question
[02:44:17.880 --> 02:44:22.880]  If you truly are the Son of God show yourself and we're seeing in great revival
[02:44:22.880 --> 02:44:26.840]  We're seeing in great miracles exactly the way the scripture told us was going to happen
[02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:32.360]  so there will be great outpouring in the end days even more than the times when Jesus walked the shores of death of
[02:44:32.640 --> 02:44:38.120]  Galilee and then we're in that spot. The question is are you going to be activated for his purpose in his glory?
[02:44:38.120 --> 02:44:42.000]  We're taking tent revivals because the Lord told me to take him to all 50 states
[02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:44.000]  We just came back from Quarryville, Pennsylvania
[02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:49.040]  And the rain came down Satan didn't want us to have this event the rain came down the Sun came up
[02:44:49.120 --> 02:44:53.120]  There was a Shekinah glory that came over the crowd that is was priceless
[02:44:53.120 --> 02:44:59.840]  And one of the people in the audience asked Lord show you mark show the true rainbow over this event
[02:44:59.840 --> 02:45:04.640]  And as we're coming out of the tent, there was a perfect rainbow sitting right over the tent
[02:45:04.640 --> 02:45:10.000]  That's God showing him showing us that he is the way the truth and the life and there's no other way
[02:45:10.040 --> 02:45:16.520]  He is the great I am that I am and you just have to ask him to come into your heart heart today if you
[02:45:16.520 --> 02:45:21.840]  Are a Christian that needs to be reactivated or if you somebody that's been on the fence and don't know the Lord
[02:45:22.280 --> 02:45:26.920]  Asking the simple question Lord. I'm a sinner. I repent. I need you
[02:45:26.920 --> 02:45:29.400]  I need you to become commander-in-chief of my life
[02:45:29.400 --> 02:45:33.520]  And if you pray that prayer and you spoke that you truly meant it you are now
[02:45:33.840 --> 02:45:38.960]  Activated for his kingdom you are activated to become a warrior for his purpose and his glory now
[02:45:38.960 --> 02:45:43.920]  You you you got to ask him. What do you want me to do like the Prophet Isaiah said here?
[02:45:43.920 --> 02:45:45.920]  I am Lord here. I am use me use me
[02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:52.520]  We need more Isaiah's today that are willing to be servants to the Most High God. It's not about glamour. It's not about money
[02:45:52.520 --> 02:45:53.960]  It's not about fame
[02:45:53.960 --> 02:46:01.880]  It's all about giving him the glory and being humble servants and putting him first and let him glorify it from east to west to
[02:46:01.880 --> 02:46:06.680]  North to south we're on the brink of the greatest revival in the history of the world
[02:46:07.040 --> 02:46:08.280]  This is history
[02:46:08.280 --> 02:46:14.920]  Even the prophets of old the disciples of Jesus would love to be where we're at at this moment in time
[02:46:14.960 --> 02:46:19.440]  The question is going to be what are you going to do with it? Are you going to be a part of this great revival?
[02:46:19.440 --> 02:46:20.920]  Are you going to be a part of?
[02:46:20.920 --> 02:46:25.960]  Glorifying our King of Kings and Lord of hosts from east to west and north to south or you gonna stay on the fence?
[02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:29.200]  It's time to get active. It's time to take a move
[02:46:29.200 --> 02:46:33.240]  It's time to step up and be a part of his purpose in his glory
[02:46:33.240 --> 02:46:41.080]  And once you do that shalom that peace that can only come from him only from him no matter what happens to the world
[02:46:41.080 --> 02:46:45.280]  You know, he's got it and it's all about his purpose and it's all about his glory
[02:46:45.280 --> 02:46:49.160]  No matter what life throws at you when you see the glory of God and you know
[02:46:49.160 --> 02:46:55.160]  He's he knows tomorrow before he does today and he know you know in your heart that he loves you more than anything in the world
[02:46:55.160 --> 02:47:00.840]  It's true love. It's a love relationship in the heart not a religion if you're doing religion
[02:47:00.840 --> 02:47:04.920]  You're doing it wrong and that's where we've been we've been taught wrong in all world religions
[02:47:04.920 --> 02:47:07.520]  You got to do this. You got to do that. You got to do the other
[02:47:07.720 --> 02:47:11.280]  No, the Most High God wanted to have a love relationship with us
[02:47:11.360 --> 02:47:16.360]  He picked us and he chose us before the beginning of time as the Prophet Jeremiah tells us
[02:47:16.360 --> 02:47:20.440]  He knew us before we were in our mother's womb and for such a time as this
[02:47:20.440 --> 02:47:25.960]  But the question is will you be activated for his purpose and his glory you say? Yes, Lord
[02:47:25.960 --> 02:47:27.960]  You are the Lord of my life. I
[02:47:28.040 --> 02:47:30.880]  Say three God can't do three things and
[02:47:31.480 --> 02:47:36.680]  People shake their heads when you hear this. God can't do three things one. He can't learn because he's all-knowing
[02:47:37.440 --> 02:47:44.240]  Number two, he can't send his word and his precepts and commandments are perfect. He can't go against his word
[02:47:44.240 --> 02:47:49.200]  That's so important to know you have a God that can't go against his precepts and commandments
[02:47:49.200 --> 02:47:51.440]  So when you know him and his word, you know
[02:47:51.440 --> 02:47:57.240]  He can't go against those precepts and commandments and the third is why we're here. He can't make you love him
[02:47:57.240 --> 02:47:58.640]  it's
[02:47:58.640 --> 02:48:05.520]  Are you going to choose today for him to become commander-in-chief in the heart for a love relationship for eternity?
[02:48:06.240 --> 02:48:11.120]  Tomorrow is never given Satan's favorite day of the week is tomorrow because tomorrow may never come
[02:48:11.120 --> 02:48:13.880]  Are you going to do it for his purpose and his glory today?
[02:48:14.120 --> 02:48:20.360]  Take action today over the glory of God and be activated for his namesake. We pray that
[02:48:21.720 --> 02:48:23.720]  Wow pastor
[02:48:24.360 --> 02:48:29.160]  Pastor Dave Scarlett just knocked it out of the park. We just need to let you be a guest host
[02:48:29.160 --> 02:48:35.360]  So I'm not there to interrupt you. That was amazing. That was powerful. We've got about nine minutes till we in this hour
[02:48:36.280 --> 02:48:39.920]  When the great guest host is going to be taken over here today
[02:48:41.120 --> 02:48:45.760]  The amazing Drew Hernandez, but but what else is on your radar screen pastor?
[02:48:46.680 --> 02:48:53.520]  Well, we again the tent revivals are so important to do. We're traveling the all 50 states to do tent revivals
[02:48:53.520 --> 02:48:56.520]  We just came out of Quarryville, Pennsylvania and the glory of God showed up
[02:48:56.880 --> 02:49:01.960]  we've baptized almost I think over 6,000 people at reawaken events and and
[02:49:02.280 --> 02:49:05.960]  Our trips to Israel and also these these tent revivals
[02:49:06.640 --> 02:49:12.160]  This is the time that God is calling his people to come into these tent revivals the old-fashioned tent revival
[02:49:12.160 --> 02:49:14.280]  It's not about fame. It's not about fortune
[02:49:14.280 --> 02:49:16.280]  it's about getting in a tent and
[02:49:16.520 --> 02:49:19.960]  Taking the glory of God and let the glory of God come down and let him
[02:49:20.200 --> 02:49:27.000]  Shine his glory and we're seeing that in just supernatural ways and it's absolutely amazing and we're going to continue that our next one is in
[02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:34.040]  New Hampshire in September the 16th. So join us on that then we'll be back in Mount Pleasant, Texas our ranch in Texas
[02:49:34.600 --> 02:49:37.760]  October 21st and then we go we have a VIP tour
[02:49:37.760 --> 02:49:39.360]  We're going to go to Israel
[02:49:39.360 --> 02:49:44.520]  To show the Holy Land to show where the places are of the Bible and the Bible will come alive for you
[02:49:44.720 --> 02:49:47.960]  Once you've gone to Israel and you see biblical Israel
[02:49:47.960 --> 02:49:54.120]  I want to stress biblical Israel the promises of the Bible that God gave to Abraham Isaac and Jacob and
[02:49:54.360 --> 02:50:00.960]  The Gentiles who can be grafted in because of the divine your your whole heart changes your whole
[02:50:01.560 --> 02:50:06.960]  Bible studies change we'll be joined on the VIP tour at the King David with General Flynn
[02:50:07.160 --> 02:50:10.200]  It'll be an incredible time to see the glory of God
[02:50:10.200 --> 02:50:15.080]  it'll be a great time to see all the biblical events that are in our Bible and
[02:50:15.360 --> 02:50:22.080]  We do three trips a year and every time we come back people are on fire for the Lord they want to have more and more
[02:50:23.480 --> 02:50:25.960]  Experiences in their Bible and that's the key, you know
[02:50:25.960 --> 02:50:31.480]  You can turn fake news off today. The only truth in this world of fake news is the living Word of God
[02:50:31.480 --> 02:50:32.400]  He cannot lie
[02:50:32.400 --> 02:50:37.680]  He tells you what tomorrow is going to be before the news even knows what tomorrow is going to be and we put our trust
[02:50:37.680 --> 02:50:41.440]  In him twenty seven point five percent of the Bible's Bible prophecy
[02:50:41.480 --> 02:50:48.600]  He's telling us things thousands of years before they happen and they're happening in our lifetime the supernatural miracles that we're selling
[02:50:49.680 --> 02:50:51.680]  our last question is
[02:50:54.040 --> 02:51:01.320]  Literally Revelation Daniel Ezekiel Old Testament Testament predicts it to a T the world government the castle society
[02:51:01.960 --> 02:51:05.800]  The social credit score. It's not just you agree to take a mark naked by himself
[02:51:05.800 --> 02:51:10.960]  You have to worship the beast to everything. It says it watches you in a lifetime describes it all
[02:51:10.960 --> 02:51:15.920]  It's a social credit score. It's the it's the it's all right there. It's it's I mean, it's it's happening
[02:51:17.320 --> 02:51:22.880]  Exactly, and you see what the whistleblower is coming forward the two whistleblowers with the IRS the IRS scandal
[02:51:22.880 --> 02:51:28.160]  That's gonna come out on top of that just fits into that that credit score and when you have the IRS
[02:51:29.200 --> 02:51:33.600]  Stopping or a credit score stopping you whether you can go to a grocery store and make a purchase

[02:51:38.000 --> 02:51:42.800]  That is today. It is on the brink never in our history of the Bible
[02:51:42.800 --> 02:51:49.600]  Has these events been right before our very eyes and people have to wake up now because there is no tomorrow if you're not

[03:00:03.040 --> 03:00:06.000]  What is going on based on criminals and
[03:00:07.040 --> 03:00:10.720]  Worldwide you are now watching the fourth hour of the most infamous
[03:00:11.360 --> 03:00:18.760]  Van transmission on the face of planet Earth arguably the universe the Alex Jones show. My name is you Hernandez?
[03:00:18.760 --> 03:00:23.920]  I'm your guest host a lot of news guys a lot of news going on today, especially
[03:00:24.680 --> 03:00:27.920]  On the stage of the New World Order and the stage
[03:00:28.720 --> 03:00:35.120]  Nationally here in the United States of America. Their plans are constantly and consistently moving forward never holding back
[03:00:35.440 --> 03:00:37.520]  They'll take their L's every now and then
[03:00:38.160 --> 03:00:41.520]  We'll thwart their plans every now and then but you got to understand
[03:00:41.880 --> 03:00:46.720]  When it comes to this Antichrist spirit and the push for the world government cashless society
[03:00:46.840 --> 03:00:50.920]  The devil never sleeps these demonic powers never sleep
[03:00:51.400 --> 03:00:53.400]  They'll take their L's but then they'll
[03:00:53.640 --> 03:01:00.120]  Restrategize and they'll come back ten times harder. Just like Jesus said when a spirits removed from a human a
[03:01:00.800 --> 03:01:06.120]  Clean shop and they come back with seven more more evil than itself and it's even worse than it was before
[03:01:06.760 --> 03:01:11.400]  Doesn't mean that we're blackmailed doesn't mean that we give up doesn't mean that God is not more powerful
[03:01:11.800 --> 03:01:16.840]  Doesn't mean that it's just totally useless to be fighting this righteous war good versus evil
[03:01:17.080 --> 03:01:20.320]  What it means is that we do not we do not get complacent
[03:01:20.920 --> 03:01:22.920]  We do not allow ourselves
[03:01:23.040 --> 03:01:25.040]  to get into this mindset where
[03:01:25.560 --> 03:01:27.000]  Well, we could just take a break
[03:01:27.000 --> 03:01:31.680]  Well, we could just kind of like let our foot off the gas for a little bit because we got a W
[03:01:31.680 --> 03:01:35.000]  It looks like they're retreating, but we know when they retreat
[03:01:35.320 --> 03:01:40.080]  It's a strategic retreat and they will come back ten times harder
[03:01:40.120 --> 03:01:46.320]  That's why we can never get complacent and why we could never let our foot off the gas
[03:01:46.320 --> 03:01:50.480]  That is why it's imperative to support info wars comm it's important
[03:01:50.480 --> 03:01:55.840]  It's imperative to support free speech systems. These people are never sleeping constantly
[03:01:56.280 --> 03:01:58.280]  Attempting to strategize how to dismantle
[03:01:58.800 --> 03:02:03.000]  This apparatus that God has given us to actually distribute
[03:02:03.520 --> 03:02:10.480]  Real information true information inside of the info war to make sure to go to the info war store calm right now get engaged
[03:02:10.480 --> 03:02:13.520]  With real economic warfare. That's one way you could do it
[03:02:13.520 --> 03:02:15.520]  If you obviously cannot be on air

[03:02:26.600 --> 03:02:29.160]  It's just this is the reality of the world that we live in
[03:02:29.760 --> 03:02:37.200]  When you're facing multi billionaires and you're facing these corporations and these entities that are fully fully engaged
[03:02:37.680 --> 03:02:41.200]  fully engaged with economic warfare to dismantle the West
[03:02:41.960 --> 03:02:45.000]  Dismantle the United States of America controlled demolition
[03:02:45.480 --> 03:02:52.600]  They are 9-11. All right, what they did at 9-11 is what they are literally doing to the United States economy right now
[03:02:52.600 --> 03:02:58.760]  That's what the great the great reset is controlled demolitions great reset build back better
[03:02:59.280 --> 03:03:01.280]  you see the
[03:03:02.400 --> 03:03:09.360]  Joe Biden yesterday. I know oven. Oh and covered it extensively yesterday, but man, dude you look
[03:03:10.160 --> 03:03:15.320]  You look at the puppet president Joe Biden they're rolling him out fresh out of bed with
[03:03:16.240 --> 03:03:21.600]  The strap marks on his cheeks still it's like that. He's literally just a shell
[03:03:21.600 --> 03:03:27.360]  He's literally just a puppet and they're rolling a body out calling it the president of the United States
[03:03:27.360 --> 03:03:29.360]  But we all know what this is
[03:03:29.800 --> 03:03:31.800]  It is just a puppet
[03:03:32.680 --> 03:03:34.640]  That is functioning
[03:03:34.640 --> 03:03:38.720]  Being told where to walk being told what to say read this on the teleprompter
[03:03:38.720 --> 03:03:44.360]  He can't even do that could barely read the globalist New World Order messages off the teleprompters, right?
[03:03:44.680 --> 03:03:49.760]  But that's that's that's the ideal candidate for the New World Order is an empty shell
[03:03:50.600 --> 03:03:53.480]  whose brain is nothing but a
[03:03:54.480 --> 03:03:56.480]  smoothie
[03:03:57.000 --> 03:04:02.160]  Lights are on when nobody's home, you know, and they want you to feel sorry for these people
[03:04:02.160 --> 03:04:07.000]  They want you to feel sorry for Joe Biden. He's just an old man. Look at him. He's so frail
[03:04:07.000 --> 03:04:12.920]  Oh, he would never hurt a fly. Yeah, right. Just go ask Ashley Biden how she feels about pervert Joe
[03:04:14.160 --> 03:04:20.400]  You know, but but that's that that's the whole agenda, right? They're pushing all of these pawns and agents of the New World Order
[03:04:20.400 --> 03:04:26.600]  They want you to feel sorry for them if they can't speak correctly. They're just empty shells John Fetter neck
[03:04:26.640 --> 03:04:34.040]  He had multiple strokes. Oh just feel sorry for him. They just need those puppets so they could continue to push these agendas
[03:04:34.040 --> 03:04:35.920]  That's why he's rolling out with the whole
[03:04:35.920 --> 03:04:42.120]  Bidenonomics, whatever the hell that means. It's just literally crapping down the American people's mouths the economy's in shambles
[03:04:42.720 --> 03:04:48.880]  Control demolition great reset build back better. I think not but the only way to build back better
[03:04:49.560 --> 03:04:53.520]  Not in the case of make America great again, but in the case of the global New World Order
[03:04:53.520 --> 03:04:56.560]  You need a great reset. We'll get into all that when we get back. So
[03:04:58.280 --> 03:05:02.040]  Have you ever spoken to your son about his overseas business dealings
[03:05:02.040 --> 03:05:04.040]  I've never spoken my son
[03:05:04.520 --> 03:05:06.000]  So, let me get this straight
[03:05:06.000 --> 03:05:10.880]  The FBI was withholding from congressional oversight a document showing that during the Obama administration
[03:05:11.160 --> 03:05:16.560]  Biden accepted a ten million dollar bribe through his son Hunter to force the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor
[03:05:16.560 --> 03:05:22.960]  That was investigating corruption an event that Donald Trump looked into sparking the first impeachment and forcing the arming of Ukraine
[03:05:23.200 --> 03:05:29.180]  in turn setting the stage for the current war against Russia evidence of the bribe was also in Hunter Biden's laptop, which the
[03:05:29.420 --> 03:05:37.580]  FBI also had but that they swore was a Russian disinformation and infiltrated social media to censor during the 2020 campaign all while the
[03:05:37.580 --> 03:05:43.900]  FBI investigates Trump for having classified documents despite the FBI admittedly letting Hillary Clinton off for a similar charge in
[03:05:44.060 --> 03:05:51.900]  2016 when they were simultaneously launching the Russiagate investigation into Donald Trump using falsified evidence provided by the Clinton campaign
[03:05:52.060 --> 03:05:54.060]  Do I have that all straight?
[03:05:59.960 --> 03:06:01.960]  I
[03:06:02.420 --> 03:06:04.420]  Guys like I said
[03:06:04.620 --> 03:06:06.940]  They are going a hundred miles an hour
[03:06:07.700 --> 03:06:12.700]  With their New World Order agendas. They have no intentions of holding back. They'll restrategize
[03:06:13.580 --> 03:06:19.500]  They'll pull back they'll regroup and then they'll launch their next ones. That's why there's agenda 21
[03:06:20.020 --> 03:06:21.660]  agenda 25
[03:06:21.660 --> 03:06:28.060]  agenda 30 agenda 50 you name it these people got plans for the next hundred years and
[03:06:28.540 --> 03:06:32.980]  When you pay close attention to how they break down their plans, they're always
[03:06:33.820 --> 03:06:38.580]  Inconsistently talking about the future. There's a reason why Klaus Schwab gets up
[03:06:39.020 --> 03:06:43.700]  Davos 2023 World Government Summit 23. There's a reason why
[03:06:44.460 --> 03:06:51.580]  They get up and they make statements like those who control or those who master that's essentially what he's saying control those who master
[03:06:51.580 --> 03:06:53.580]  the technologies of the future
[03:06:54.060 --> 03:06:57.860]  They will literally be masters of the future they'll be masters of the universe
[03:06:57.860 --> 03:07:04.380]  They'll be masters of everything going into the future. And why do they say that they say that because not only do they want to play
[03:07:04.380 --> 03:07:08.340]  God they want to be God, but they want to ascend
[03:07:08.980 --> 03:07:10.060]  above
[03:07:10.060 --> 03:07:17.700]  The one and only true God that's that's the heart of the global New World Order. It's not just world domination
[03:07:17.700 --> 03:07:21.200]  Yes, that is that that's the endgame that we see in the Bible
[03:07:21.560 --> 03:07:24.440]  But the absolute heartbeat the
[03:07:25.240 --> 03:07:29.840]  Thrust of what drives these people to do what they do. They want world domination
[03:07:29.840 --> 03:07:33.520]  They want control but at the epicenter of this entire thing
[03:07:33.880 --> 03:07:41.760]  What these people want is they want to be God they want to ascend above God and by doing so they want to remove
[03:07:41.760 --> 03:07:47.240]  God and push God out of the picture and obviously that won't happen. Obviously that cannot happen
[03:07:47.240 --> 03:07:49.240]  But that is what it means to be
[03:07:49.640 --> 03:07:50.600]  Antichrist
[03:07:50.600 --> 03:07:55.600]  The spirit of the Antichrist that the Bible says has been deployed into planet Earth
[03:07:55.600 --> 03:07:58.760]  it's already been out there for the past few thousand years and
[03:07:59.720 --> 03:08:07.160]  The Apostle John says the Antichrist the one and only the Antichrist will rise
[03:08:08.240 --> 03:08:14.080]  Eventually, and we're seeing the infrastructure is all there guys the clack the cashless society the one world government
[03:08:14.520 --> 03:08:17.440]  the one world religion one world economic system
[03:08:17.920 --> 03:08:24.640]  One world militarized system. It's all there. It's all being prepared the infrastructure digitally
[03:08:24.640 --> 03:08:26.720]  I could say the technology is definitely there
[03:08:27.320 --> 03:08:29.320]  theologians have always asked
[03:08:29.360 --> 03:08:32.360]  How in the world could the mark of the beast be implemented?
[03:08:32.520 --> 03:08:36.680]  We understand that anyone can come out and put some kind of mark or put some kind of decree
[03:08:38.160 --> 03:08:44.360]  Like the Nazis through the Star of David on patch on the Jews to identify who's who right? Um
[03:08:44.360 --> 03:08:51.040]  But theologians have how would they accurately Oh, how would they accurately worldwide be able to monitor?
[03:08:51.920 --> 03:08:53.920]  surveil and uphold
[03:08:55.040 --> 03:08:57.040]  something so advanced and
[03:08:57.600 --> 03:08:59.600]  I think now if you live
[03:08:59.640 --> 03:09:02.320]  Post Neuralink you live now post AI
[03:09:02.840 --> 03:09:07.480]  You live now post the rocket age the industrial age here
[03:09:07.480 --> 03:09:13.640]  We are anyone that uh has been around for the past I would say and argue maybe 70 years ago
[03:09:13.640 --> 03:09:15.200]  maybe 70 years
[03:09:15.200 --> 03:09:18.600]  Would be able to answer that question like that. I
[03:09:19.320 --> 03:09:23.320]  Mean really realistically think about it, right? I was a youth pastor for six years
[03:09:23.840 --> 03:09:27.720]  And when I would talk about this to Gen Z and they're like what?
[03:09:29.160 --> 03:09:35.760]  Whoa, we could definitely see a mark of the beast happening like that because this generation knows technology
[03:09:36.760 --> 03:09:38.560]  You go talk to Gen Z right now
[03:09:39.000 --> 03:09:43.000]  Understand how easy a mark of the beast could be implemented like that
[03:09:43.000 --> 03:09:48.760]  I mean if you weren't around in 2020 in the kovat lockdown CCP the way that GG ping gets down
[03:09:49.400 --> 03:09:50.480]  Klaus Schwab Bill Gates
[03:09:50.480 --> 03:09:55.800]  They all praise China for how they surveil the surveillance state big brother the social credit scores
[03:09:56.200 --> 03:10:02.840]  Monitoring everybody's behavior if you're a good citizen of the New World Order, then then you are allowed to function in society
[03:10:03.280 --> 03:10:06.280]  It's all here guys the infrastructure exists
[03:10:06.920 --> 03:10:12.000]  And not just the infrastructure technologically when it comes to the New World Order, but also the mindset
[03:10:12.800 --> 03:10:14.800]  Also, the mindset has been primed
[03:10:15.960 --> 03:10:20.080]  cultures, not just one country not just five countries
[03:10:20.520 --> 03:10:24.920]  Worldwide post 2020 we saw the entire world bend the knee
[03:10:25.440 --> 03:10:30.640]  To an agenda to multiple federal governments locking down their citizens
[03:10:31.320 --> 03:10:38.400]  Big brother telling the entire world's non elected entities World Health Organization. Dr. Fauci's you name it?
[03:10:38.400 --> 03:10:42.240]  Dr. Birx all these deep state plants all these New World Order plants, right?
[03:10:42.960 --> 03:10:49.440]  UN EU all colluding together World Economic Forum all of their proxies that come out all
[03:10:50.720 --> 03:10:55.200]  Prescribing what the federal government should do for the United States of America
[03:10:55.720 --> 03:10:57.720]  You see dr. Fauci
[03:10:58.320 --> 03:11:01.280]  14 days to stop the spread they get in there in the Trump White House
[03:11:01.280 --> 03:11:07.520]  They're directing the Trump White House what to do operation warp speed you name it these unelected bureaucrats that get in that are New World
[03:11:07.520 --> 03:11:12.080]  Order and they influence policy in countries, especially the United States of America
[03:11:12.800 --> 03:11:16.240]  You see but the point I'm trying to get to is not only are we ready?
[03:11:17.280 --> 03:11:19.440]  And what I mean by ready? I'm not saying the Christian
[03:11:19.440 --> 03:11:22.880]  I'm saying just a culture a people a civilization
[03:11:22.880 --> 03:11:24.880]  Not just the United States of America
[03:11:24.880 --> 03:11:30.160]  The mind has been primed to accept worldwide tyranny, not just a
[03:11:31.040 --> 03:11:38.400]  nationalistic tyranny right what communism totalitarianism is the Fidel Castro's of the mouths the Stalin's it's all like this
[03:11:39.040 --> 03:11:41.040]  National communism, right?
[03:11:41.040 --> 03:11:46.560]  Be a good commie be a good citizen of your country the Nazis. It's all this nationalistic fascism communism
[03:11:47.120 --> 03:11:49.920]  Okay, but but but what we're dealing with and what I noticed
[03:11:49.920 --> 03:11:52.720]  Post 2020 was this this worldwide
[03:11:54.000 --> 03:11:58.560]  This worldwide. That's that's everything we saw was a stay home save lives
[03:11:59.280 --> 03:12:02.640]  Just get jabbed. You're gonna save lives. You're gonna be a good citizen of the world
[03:12:03.200 --> 03:12:07.360]  Good citizen of the world. You're gonna save the world if you get jabbed ten times
[03:12:07.520 --> 03:12:13.360]  You're gonna save the world if you just stay home and stay locked down. This is a pandemic. This is a chaotic
[03:12:14.240 --> 03:12:19.840]  Scenario doomsday you have to stay home. You have to be a good citizen of the world
[03:12:19.920 --> 03:12:25.200]  Stay home and in order to be a good citizen stay home stay home save lives
[03:12:26.240 --> 03:12:32.640]  Sacrifice your freedom. We saw this the mainstream media was all in on it the mainstream corporate media the new world order
[03:12:33.440 --> 03:12:34.940]  all these
[03:12:34.940 --> 03:12:37.920]  Proxies and in the medical industry in the health industry
[03:12:38.000 --> 03:12:42.160]  Oh, we're all they all have the same message the same unified message
[03:12:42.320 --> 03:12:49.600]  That was coming down from the un the eu these bureaucrats in the world health organization that nobody elected that have been influencing policy
[03:12:50.560 --> 03:12:52.560]  for the usa and by the way
[03:12:52.960 --> 03:12:56.800]  They're already embracing for the next stage of this the next phase of this
[03:12:58.240 --> 03:13:00.240]  That they'll open up the united states of america
[03:13:00.240 --> 03:13:06.080]  We'll just we'll just you know, we'll just hand over the reins to the united nations. Uh, because if this ever happens again, we saw
[03:13:06.720 --> 03:13:14.640]  How the info warriors we saw how the freedom movement we saw how patriots that would not let go of their freedoms to save their countrymen
[03:13:14.800 --> 03:13:19.840]  Yeah, and and then you had the man the the mask formation colt you guys remember this people running around the streets
[03:13:20.160 --> 03:13:25.280]  All the left-leaning npcs all these woke-tard morons running around saying, you know, screw your freedoms, man
[03:13:25.440 --> 03:13:28.240]  Screw your freedoms to save lives. You're like jimmy kimmel
[03:13:28.800 --> 03:13:36.000]  All the late night tv shows steven colbert screw your freedoms, man. We gotta save people. It's like this total virtue signal, right?
[03:13:37.280 --> 03:13:42.240]  I guess like psychologically that's that's why the info war is so important to be engaged in
[03:13:42.640 --> 03:13:47.600]  And having your mind unlocked plugged out of the matrix because when the matrix starts to
[03:13:49.040 --> 03:13:53.760]  You know upload their latest downloads for the npcs and I mean that's what the matrix is, right?
[03:13:53.760 --> 03:13:57.860]  The matrix is essentially a simulated environment a simulated reality
[03:13:58.320 --> 03:14:00.320]  That's supposed to get the mind to believe
[03:14:00.640 --> 03:14:07.200]  That what they're seeing what they're hearing what they're touching what they're feeling what they're engaging with and interfacing with is actually real
[03:14:08.080 --> 03:14:10.080]  And we live in this guys we live
[03:14:10.400 --> 03:14:12.400]  In a multi-dimensional universe
[03:14:12.540 --> 03:14:18.400]  Multi-dimensional world we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against powers principality spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places
[03:14:18.560 --> 03:14:22.320]  We engage we interface if you're born again christian you interface with the holy spirit
[03:14:22.640 --> 03:14:25.440]  If you're a child of the devil you interface with the world you interface
[03:14:25.600 --> 03:14:29.120]  That's all run by the devil or you interface with demons the new world order the occult
[03:14:29.200 --> 03:14:33.840]  They're all involved with this every single day. We're going back and forth and it's it's only going to stop
[03:14:34.560 --> 03:14:39.360]  When christ returns and that's the war that's the end game that we're all going towards right now
[03:14:40.720 --> 03:14:42.240]  What i'm saying is
[03:14:42.240 --> 03:14:44.240]  Your mind is so valuable
[03:14:44.960 --> 03:14:51.940]  To satan and the new world order. They know how powerful your mind is. Why do you think that even in davos 23?
[03:14:53.120 --> 03:14:57.520]  You had globalists up there literally talking about an information war
[03:14:58.160 --> 03:15:00.160]  They literally sounded like you and me
[03:15:00.720 --> 03:15:05.440]  You guys they literally sounded like alex jones owens treuer harrison smith
[03:15:05.680 --> 03:15:11.680]  Talking about the info war that we are all engaged in how powerful it is to understand how imperative it is to have
[03:15:11.920 --> 03:15:15.920]  Accurate and true information and when I say that i'm not talking about like how you know
[03:15:15.920 --> 03:15:20.020]  The fbi says that our google says it. Oh and misinformation disinformation
[03:15:20.160 --> 03:15:25.040]  We got to make sure that we are upholding the truth. Rachel maddow lesbian gets up on their msnb
[03:15:25.600 --> 03:15:31.540]  Msnbc and oh, we're not gonna run. We're not gonna air trump speaking after the indictment because he he's misinformation
[03:15:31.840 --> 03:15:33.840]  We have to make sure we're reporting the truth
[03:15:34.400 --> 03:15:36.240]  What i'm saying guys is
[03:15:36.240 --> 03:15:40.560]  There is literally a war for your psyche. There's literally a war for your conscience
[03:15:40.880 --> 03:15:46.560]  There's literally a war for your mind and the other side is fully engaged fully engaged fully aware
[03:15:46.960 --> 03:15:50.800]  Win their mind rule their mind manipulate their mind propagate their mind
[03:15:50.880 --> 03:15:56.160]  And if we do that successfully we will rule their entire lives. We'll be right back
[03:15:56.960 --> 03:15:59.440]  There is a war for the future happening right now

[03:19:08.800 --> 03:19:15.360]  Which has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population and there are two things we need to do about it
[03:19:15.840 --> 03:19:18.800]  We need to practice more regenerative farming
[03:19:19.200 --> 03:19:25.440]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally keep the soil
[03:19:25.840 --> 03:19:31.920]  Rich with iodine and we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day

[03:20:39.300 --> 03:20:43.420]  trying to make is this all right the point i'm trying to make is technologically the
[03:20:43.420 --> 03:20:49.020]  entire world has the infrastructure ready for the mark of the beast all right the entire
[03:20:49.020 --> 03:20:56.980]  world has the infrastructure and the technology to take the world to the next level into that
[03:20:56.980 --> 03:21:00.779]  becoming a reality it's already a reality right now the scripture has already foretold
[03:21:00.779 --> 03:21:11.260]  this but as time catches up so does technology as we go further down the timeline all right
[03:21:11.260 --> 03:21:17.340]  as we go further down the timeline in uh the current timeline that we find ourselves in
[03:21:17.340 --> 03:21:23.580]  right now things begin to come to fruition that's eschatology that's bible prophecy god
[03:21:23.580 --> 03:21:28.380]  has already ordained all of this he's already foretold all of this he's shown us just exactly
[03:21:28.380 --> 03:21:33.180]  how the global new world order is going to be developing and the epicenter will be israel
[03:21:33.180 --> 03:21:38.300]  by the way one of the things that the apostle paul who's a jew uh super jew by the way one
[03:21:38.300 --> 03:21:43.500]  of the things that the apostle paul broke down very clearly in an eschatological manner
[03:21:43.500 --> 03:21:51.779]  was that there will be a third jewish temple that will be around in this scenario when
[03:21:51.779 --> 03:21:56.820]  the antichrist is finally revealed because he says that he will enter into the temple
[03:21:56.820 --> 03:22:01.420]  the jewish temple that's in israel right now he will sit down in the holy of holies
[03:22:01.420 --> 03:22:08.460]  and he will declare himself to be god and to be worshipped as anything else that's considered
[03:22:08.460 --> 03:22:16.340]  god he he will be declaring himself to be god the almighty he wants to be worshipped
[03:22:16.340 --> 03:22:22.660]  as the one true god all the muslims must bow all the jews must bow all those that claim
[03:22:22.660 --> 03:22:28.420]  to believe in christ must bow all those that worship plants must bow all the hindus must
[03:22:28.420 --> 03:22:36.580]  bow whatever religion you could think of you must bow to the antichrist the centralized
[03:22:36.580 --> 03:22:44.220]  figure the end times scenario empowered by the dragon that's satan all right literally
[03:22:44.220 --> 03:22:53.420]  possessed by satan false prophet fully activated they are in full operation antichrist right
[03:22:53.420 --> 03:22:59.420]  there the unholy trinity that you see in the end time scenario so when it does come to
[03:22:59.420 --> 03:23:05.140]  israel and it comes i mean you go to israel today you go take a trip you go check it out
[03:23:05.140 --> 03:23:10.779]  they're already literally developing a third jewish temple the plans are there they're
[03:23:10.859 --> 03:23:16.380]  already developing it they're already strategizing it they're already putting together what the
[03:23:16.380 --> 03:23:21.820]  models will look like how they'll do it on the temple mount they just haven't been given the
[03:23:21.820 --> 03:23:26.940]  access to start building on the temple mount because of the conflict up there they'll start
[03:23:26.940 --> 03:23:32.779]  a religious war but somehow some way the bible's already all foretold all this the jews the state
[03:23:32.779 --> 03:23:38.300]  that the israelis at the time this is end time scenario the jews and the israelis at the time
[03:23:38.300 --> 03:23:46.060]  they will embrace the antichrist as the messiah they'll embrace him as jesus christ this this
[03:23:46.060 --> 03:23:51.580]  is the huge deception that you see in the end time scenario it will be the israelis that embrace the
[03:23:51.580 --> 03:23:57.260]  antichrist and the by the but i'm giving you guys the bible this is not my opinion this is not my
[03:23:57.260 --> 03:24:05.420]  commentary the bible okay the bible foretells that the israelis they will embrace the antichrist
[03:24:06.060 --> 03:24:10.539]  it's called a deception they will be totally deceived that's what the entire seven-year
[03:24:10.539 --> 03:24:17.740]  tribulation is about the time of jacob's trouble speaking of israel they've turned their back on
[03:24:17.740 --> 03:24:24.060]  christ they rejected the messiah at the first time and then the next indictment i mean you even the
[03:24:24.060 --> 03:24:28.779]  apostle paul who's a jew by the way you look at romans chapter 10 romans chapter 11 the state
[03:24:28.779 --> 03:24:33.740]  of israel the jewish people are are under a spiritual stupor they're they're they're under
[03:24:33.740 --> 03:24:41.100]  this uh spiritual numbness this blindness like a judgment from god but there's hope because the
[03:24:41.100 --> 03:24:46.060]  bible says god loves israel he loves his people he wants to wake them up he wants to see them
[03:24:46.060 --> 03:24:52.539]  saved and come to the real messiah but the first indictment was rejecting christ i'm giving you
[03:24:52.539 --> 03:24:59.500]  guys bible it's not anti-semitism this is this is scripture okay the jews rejected jesus first
[03:24:59.500 --> 03:25:05.180]  that's the first indictment they went into a spiritual stupor total blindness they're deceived
[03:25:05.180 --> 03:25:10.380]  right just like mankind is deceived the gentiles are deceived all people that are not christians
[03:25:10.380 --> 03:25:15.180]  are deceived right the second indictment this is according to the bible go research this this is
[03:25:15.180 --> 03:25:21.260]  in the prophets the old testament jewish prophets foretell this so i'm giving you old testament
[03:25:21.260 --> 03:25:29.500]  jewish prophecy okay uh they foretell that the the israelis the jews they will be deceived again
[03:25:29.500 --> 03:25:35.580]  this is in zechariah 14 you name it they will be deceived again they will embrace because they're
[03:25:35.580 --> 03:25:41.660]  still looking for a messiah they're still searching for the first coming of the messiah
[03:25:41.660 --> 03:25:45.500]  because they look to their scriptures the old testament and they they still are under this
[03:25:45.500 --> 03:25:51.900]  impression that well jesus was just a revolutionary he was a heretic so when they crucified and killed
[03:25:51.900 --> 03:25:57.500]  him not just the romans but the jews of the day that was necessary because he was blasphemous
[03:25:57.500 --> 03:26:03.500]  and the crimes of blasphemy claiming to be god jesus's indictment to the jews at the time it
[03:26:03.500 --> 03:26:09.020]  wasn't that he was offensive to them it wasn't that he just didn't abide by their you know
[03:26:09.020 --> 03:26:17.580]  doctrines of man jesus claimed to be god okay because he's god in human flesh all right that's
[03:26:17.580 --> 03:26:23.980]  what triggered the jews of that day the religious pharisees triggered them beyond belief that's what
[03:26:23.980 --> 03:26:31.900]  led them to literally conspire to murder jesus christ that's the gospel message christ being
[03:26:31.900 --> 03:26:38.619]  put on the cross because christ claimed to be god man all right that's blasphemy blasphemy laws
[03:26:38.619 --> 03:26:43.340]  death death death death death and the romans just had to get involved because they viewed jesus as
[03:26:43.340 --> 03:26:48.060]  an insurrectionist and a possible threat to the state and he was a revolutionary figure had
[03:26:48.060 --> 03:26:54.220]  thousands of people following him not digitally on social media literally physically a dude with a
[03:26:54.220 --> 03:26:59.660]  mob of thousands of people following him yes conscious pilots saw that the romans saw that as
[03:26:59.660 --> 03:27:05.260]  that's a threat to our power and our structures put an end to it if the jews want him dead then
[03:27:05.260 --> 03:27:10.140]  you you go along with it just put an end to the whole thing we don't we don't want riots we don't
[03:27:10.140 --> 03:27:15.580]  want an insurrection we don't want an uprising just put a stop to it there was a lot going on
[03:27:15.580 --> 03:27:20.380]  with jesus in his ministry man but that's the first indictment right the second indictment
[03:27:21.580 --> 03:27:28.779]  that you see according to the jewish prophets in the old testament is that they will accept
[03:27:28.779 --> 03:27:36.539]  and embrace and be deceived by the antichrist this is all foretold he's going to be a rock star
[03:27:36.539 --> 03:27:43.740]  worldwide bring global peace bring global unity he's going to be an individual that will somehow
[03:27:43.740 --> 03:27:49.900]  some way bring religious peace between the jews and the muslims these two that have been at war
[03:27:49.900 --> 03:27:56.300]  for thousands of years a blood religious warfare somehow some way peace and safety and security
[03:27:56.300 --> 03:28:03.180]  the bible says first second thessalonian this guy will be a rock star and he will cut a peace treaty
[03:28:03.180 --> 03:28:08.300]  with the state of israel he'll cut a peace treaty with the jews they'll embrace him and they'll view
[03:28:08.300 --> 03:28:16.539]  that that right there somehow bringing world peace total rock star they will view that as messianic
[03:28:16.539 --> 03:28:24.779]  levels of fulfilling their scriptures prophecy they will embrace and it will be all satanically
[03:28:24.779 --> 03:28:29.740]  charged it will all be demonically charged and they will embrace the anti this is all in the
[03:28:29.740 --> 03:28:33.180]  bible guys this is not my opinion call it whatever you want it's all in the bible go see it for
[03:28:33.180 --> 03:28:41.020]  yourself all the jewish prophets foretell this okay but but it doesn't end there they will see
[03:28:41.020 --> 03:28:45.260]  that they will be deceived at the end of the seven-year great tribulation there will be a
[03:28:45.260 --> 03:28:51.180]  rendement the jews will finally see they've been deceived they will see and identify the real messiah
[03:28:51.180 --> 03:28:55.660]  that's what god wants he wants them all saved in an eternity forever we'll be right back we'll get

[03:30:05.580 --> 03:30:09.660]  the fbi was withholding from congressional oversight a document showing that during the
[03:30:09.660 --> 03:30:14.220]  obama administration biden accepted a 10 million dollar bribe through his son hunter to force the
[03:30:14.220 --> 03:30:18.539]  firing of a ukrainian prosecutor that was investigating corruption an event that donald
[03:30:18.539 --> 03:30:23.260]  trump looked into sparking the first impeachment enforcing the arming of ukraine in turn setting
[03:30:23.260 --> 03:30:27.420]  the stage for the current war against russia evidence of the bribe was also in hunter biden's
[03:30:27.420 --> 03:30:33.180]  laptop which the fbi also had but that they swore was russian disinformation and infiltrated social
[03:30:33.180 --> 03:30:38.539]  media to censor during the 2020 campaign all while the fbi investigates trump for having
[03:30:38.539 --> 03:30:43.100]  classified documents despite the fbi admittedly letting hillary clinton off for a similar charge
[03:30:43.100 --> 03:30:47.740]  in 2016 when they were simultaneously launching the russiagate investigation into donald trump

[03:33:05.800 --> 03:33:23.080]  Cashless society, New World Order, global government, surveillance state, deep state operations,
[03:33:23.080 --> 03:33:29.359]  you're all watching it, you're all watching it unfold, the technology's there, the cultural
[03:33:29.359 --> 03:33:37.920]  mindset is ready and primed, not just as the Bible foretells, the Jews and the state of
[03:33:37.920 --> 03:33:44.560]  Israel that will embrace the Antichrist, but the entire world, the entire world will
[03:33:44.560 --> 03:33:50.720]  be swayed, will be deceived, accepting the global New World Order government, accepting
[03:33:50.720 --> 03:33:57.519]  the global tyranny, accepting a centralized leader, a centralized commander, a centralized
[03:33:57.519 --> 03:34:04.039]  economic system, mark of the beast, in the hand, in the forehead, no access to the economy,
[03:34:04.039 --> 03:34:12.080]  that's an identification of worship as Him being your God, your commander-in-chief, your
[03:34:12.080 --> 03:34:18.439]  Almighty One, your theological allegiance, that's what this is all about.

[03:34:26.439 --> 03:34:31.080]  not just like the usual suspects that are always dealing with communism and tyranny
[03:34:31.080 --> 03:34:40.759]  and oppression, like North Korea or Cuba, Venezuela, no, we saw the entire world bend the knee
[03:34:40.759 --> 03:34:47.320]  to unelected bureaucrat organizations, World Health Organization, you name it, to lock
[03:34:47.320 --> 03:34:56.039]  down, not go outside, sacrifice your freedoms in the name of safety and protecting and saving
[03:34:56.039 --> 03:34:59.960]  lives, and we saw millions of people willing to do this.
[03:34:59.960 --> 03:35:02.640]  Okay, that's the next phase of tyranny.
[03:35:02.640 --> 03:35:08.439]  The next phase is that the mind, psychologically, yes, there's awakening, yes, there's people
[03:35:08.439 --> 03:35:13.480]  that will wake up to this reality, there are millions of people that will get red-pilled,
[03:35:13.480 --> 03:35:18.039]  Christ-pilled, they'll see the truth, pulled out of the matrix, pulled out of the simulation,
[03:35:18.039 --> 03:35:22.000]  seeing exactly what everything truly is for what it is, not being deceived, recognizing
[03:35:22.000 --> 03:35:26.640]  who Agent Smith truly is, recognizing who the agents are, recognizing who's true, who's
[03:35:26.640 --> 03:35:32.279]  not, who's truly a sheep, who's truly awake, who's truly born again, who's truly speaking
[03:35:32.279 --> 03:35:37.439]  the truth, who's really got true information, aside from the real misinformation and disinformation,
[03:35:37.439 --> 03:35:41.759]  you get pulled out of the matrix, you get pulled out of it, you see the truth, and the
[03:35:41.759 --> 03:35:47.880]  truth shall set you free, and it does that, that's gonna keep happening, man, but we're
[03:35:47.880 --> 03:35:54.080]  not gonna be without persecution, we're not gonna be without persecution, there will be
[03:35:54.080 --> 03:36:01.000]  revival, but there also will be persecution, the Bible foretells this very clear, those
[03:36:01.000 --> 03:36:09.320]  who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will, shall, suffer persecution.
[03:36:09.320 --> 03:36:13.679]  It comes with the job, man, Christ said they hated me, they will hate you more, they called
[03:36:13.720 --> 03:36:20.080]  me Beelzebub, they called me the devil, man, what do you think they're gonna do to you guys?
[03:36:20.080 --> 03:36:27.080]  So be ready and anticipate it, it's to be accepted, well let's get into some of the
[03:36:27.080 --> 03:36:31.560]  news guys, because everything that we talk about, World Economic Forum, all this global
[03:36:31.560 --> 03:36:36.039]  New World Order news that you're seeing, UN, Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates.
[03:36:37.100 --> 03:36:43.100]  Noah Yuval Harari, all these satanic globalists that want to jack your mind into some kind of VR system.
[03:36:43.100 --> 03:36:48.100]  They are all pushing towards that goal.
[03:36:48.100 --> 03:36:51.100]  Here's a perfect example right here.
[03:36:51.100 --> 03:36:55.100]  Klaus Schwab praises CCP for its COVID control measures.
[03:36:55.100 --> 03:37:00.100]  Oh, well, of course, because Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates absolutely loves,
[03:37:00.100 --> 03:37:06.100]  absolutely loves the way that the CCP oppresses their citizens,
[03:37:06.100 --> 03:37:10.100]  loves the social credit scores, loves the lockdowns,
[03:37:10.100 --> 03:37:16.100]  loves seeing people screaming from their skyscraper apartment little shelter buildings,
[03:37:16.100 --> 03:37:26.100]  loves seeing Chinese people being oppressed by being welded into their apartments to die as they get incinerated and set on fire.
[03:37:26.100 --> 03:37:31.100]  Klaus Schwab loves it, loves it. He loves it.
[03:37:31.100 --> 03:37:39.100]  He loves to see you oppressed, loves to see you die, loves to see the CCP surveil their people and murder, murder, murder.
[03:37:39.100 --> 03:37:44.100]  He loves it. These people hate you.
[03:37:44.100 --> 03:37:47.100]  They hate you and they want to see you die.
[03:37:47.100 --> 03:37:50.100]  They don't want to see you oppressed. They don't want to see you with a lack of freedom.
[03:37:50.100 --> 03:37:53.100]  They want to see you die.
[03:37:53.200 --> 03:37:59.760]  Anyways, Klaus Schwab praises CCP for its COVID control measures.
[03:37:59.760 --> 03:38:01.560]  Oh, would you look at that.
[03:38:01.560 --> 03:38:06.720]  At the World Economic Forum's 14th annual meeting of the new champions, which took place
[03:38:06.720 --> 03:38:13.200]  in China, the founder of the World Economic Forum, Klaus Schwab, delivered a speech.
[03:38:13.300 --> 03:38:37.539]  Premier Li is the ex-premier of the People's Republic of China and a member of the Chinese
[03:38:37.539 --> 03:38:47.019]  Communist Party Central Committee Politburo Standing Committee. Premier Li has a distinguished
[03:38:47.019 --> 03:38:57.820]  career in public service, having led the economic and social development of three major provinces
[03:38:57.820 --> 03:39:10.019]  – Zhejiang, Yangtze and Shanghai. He has also been instrumental in opening up China's
[03:39:10.019 --> 03:39:20.779]  capital market, attracting foreign investment and innovation, and creating new urban areas
[03:39:20.779 --> 03:39:22.779]  to address land scarcity.
[03:39:23.779 --> 03:39:30.779]  Well, there you have it, guys. I apologize. I'm having some issues with the video right now. I'll get that fixed later.
[03:39:30.779 --> 03:39:40.779]  But this is it, okay? Klaus Schwab hates you and has continually, okay, even to this day,
[03:39:40.779 --> 03:39:48.779]  continually communicates, not only to the American people, continues to communicate to planet Earth
[03:39:48.779 --> 03:39:53.779]  that the way that the CCP dealt with their citizens during the COVID-controlled lockdowns,
[03:39:53.779 --> 03:40:00.779]  zero COVID policy, he loves it. He loves it. He wants to see that rolled out worldwide.
[03:40:00.779 --> 03:40:05.779]  He wants to see everyone get terrorized. He wants to see everyone get oppressed.
[03:40:05.779 --> 03:40:10.779]  He wants to see everyone be oppressed. He wants to see everybody put in a house,
[03:40:10.779 --> 03:40:16.779]  put in a skyscraper where they're controlled, where they're welded in and they burn down the building
[03:40:16.779 --> 03:40:21.779]  and they kill you and they take your family and they give you a social credit score
[03:40:21.779 --> 03:40:26.779]  and you either get a red light, which means you can't have access to the economy,
[03:40:26.779 --> 03:40:30.779]  you can't go outside and exercise, you can't go out and socialize with your family.
[03:40:30.779 --> 03:40:35.779]  You have to stay inside, stay in there, because you spoke out against the regime.
[03:40:35.779 --> 03:40:40.779]  Stay inside your house. We're going to weld you in. And if the CCP, if the agents of the deep state
[03:40:40.779 --> 03:40:45.779]  come in and want to burn down your skyscraper and your little shanty, then you're going to die.
[03:40:45.779 --> 03:40:53.779]  Oh, but if you're really being kind of good, we'll give you a yellow light.
[03:40:53.779 --> 03:40:58.779]  So that means that you're still a bad boy. You're still a bad girl.
[03:40:58.779 --> 03:41:04.779]  But we'll give you a little bit of leniency. You can go for a walk for four minutes.
[03:41:04.779 --> 03:41:12.779]  You can go outside for a walk for four minutes. And you won't be cut out of the economy.
[03:41:13.779 --> 03:41:18.779]  But we'll give you designated bugs. All right. We'll give you designated bugs.
[03:41:18.779 --> 03:41:22.779]  You can have four cockroaches a day, four cockroaches a day.
[03:41:22.779 --> 03:41:29.779]  And you can go outside for four minutes a day. And you can look outside for four minutes a day.
[03:41:29.779 --> 03:41:33.779]  And after that, that's it. That's it. Because we got drones flying around.
[03:41:33.779 --> 03:41:38.779]  We got facial recognition. And we could see if you stick your dirty little freedom face
[03:41:38.779 --> 03:41:44.779]  outside that window, then we're going to come and burn down the building and kill you.
[03:41:44.779 --> 03:41:50.779]  Oh, but if you are a good citizen of the New World Order, you are good for CCP.
[03:41:50.779 --> 03:41:54.779]  You are good for you. Yes, you are good for Xi Jinping.
[03:41:54.779 --> 03:41:57.779]  You are good. Yes, you're good for the regime.
[03:41:57.779 --> 03:42:02.779]  CCP says you are OK. We love you. Yes, obey, obey, obey.
[03:42:02.779 --> 03:42:05.779]  You love the tyranny. You love the tyranny, don't you?
[03:42:05.779 --> 03:42:08.779]  You will own nothing and we will control your life forever.
[03:42:08.779 --> 03:42:13.779]  If not, we will kill you too. CCP, CCP, CCP. Yes.
[03:42:13.779 --> 03:42:18.779]  It's like dislike. Oh, then you get the green light.
[03:42:18.779 --> 03:42:22.779]  Then you get the green light. You own nothing. You're happy.
[03:42:22.779 --> 03:42:27.779]  They take all of your product of means. OK, they take everything you own.
[03:42:27.779 --> 03:42:32.779]  They you own nothing. They control every aspect of your life.
[03:42:32.779 --> 03:42:36.779]  They control your flow of information. They control what you can see on the Internet.
[03:42:36.779 --> 03:42:39.779]  They're constantly surveilling you inside your house, outside your house.
[03:42:39.779 --> 03:42:46.779]  Your identity is totally gone. See, but only only if you are in compliance with the regime.
[03:42:46.779 --> 03:42:51.779]  Can you have access to that civilization? That's what Klaus Schwab loves.
[03:42:51.779 --> 03:42:55.779]  Oh, I bet he does. That's why he wants to be the master of the universe.
[03:42:56.779 --> 03:43:02.779]  Two of our best selling new tropics or brain boosters are now back in stock and in full or store.
[03:43:02.779 --> 03:43:07.779]  I come for a limited time. They're 50 percent off when you get them together or 40 percent off.
[03:43:07.779 --> 03:43:12.779]  You get them individually. Brain Force Plus and Brain Force Ultra, two separate formulas.
[03:43:12.779 --> 03:43:15.779]  They both give you good, clean energy without the crash.
[03:43:15.779 --> 03:43:21.779]  One is a four to six hour good base of clean energy, again, with no hangover or letdown.
[03:43:22.779 --> 03:43:27.779]  And the other is a very special proprietary formula that's Brain Force Ultra that hits really, really quick.
[03:43:27.779 --> 03:43:29.779]  And I love it. It wears off in two to three hours.
[03:43:29.779 --> 03:43:33.779]  So if I've got to work at night but don't want to stay up all night, I can take it and say nine o'clock at night.
[03:43:33.779 --> 03:43:39.779]  I stay up till midnight working, doing a radio interview or something and boom, writing an article or writing a book.
[03:43:39.779 --> 03:43:43.779]  And then I get two, three hours of energy and then you go right to bed after it.
[03:43:43.779 --> 03:43:48.779]  Brain Force Ultra, Brain Force Plus, both 50 percent off by themselves or 40 percent off individually.
[03:43:48.779 --> 03:43:51.779]  A lot of people love these products. They've got five-star reviews.
[03:43:51.779 --> 03:43:56.779]  But if you haven't tried them, you really should. 50 percent off, InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:43:56.779 --> 03:44:02.779]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were going to move against Tucker Carlson and take him off the air.
[03:44:02.779 --> 03:44:05.779]  People said, no way, he's the most powerful thing that ever happened.
[03:44:05.779 --> 03:44:07.779]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[03:44:07.779 --> 03:44:10.779]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control him.
[03:44:10.779 --> 03:44:13.779]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[03:44:13.779 --> 03:44:15.779]  It's the same thing with InfoWars.
[03:44:15.779 --> 03:44:21.779]  InfoWars is not owned by Fox or controlled by George Soros or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[03:44:21.779 --> 03:44:24.779]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[03:44:24.779 --> 03:44:27.779]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[03:44:27.779 --> 03:44:31.779]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[03:44:31.779 --> 03:44:35.779]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[03:44:35.779 --> 03:44:38.779]  So I want to thank you for your support and encourage viewers and listeners to understand.
[03:44:38.779 --> 03:44:41.779]  Please don't take InfoWars for granted.
[03:44:41.779 --> 03:44:42.779]  We're barely hanging on.
[03:44:42.779 --> 03:44:45.779]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support,

[03:45:04.779 --> 03:45:07.779]  You have a little profile there, cancel anytime.
[03:45:07.779 --> 03:45:12.779]  Every 15 days, every month, every 3 months, every 6 months, up to 9 months,
[03:45:12.779 --> 03:45:15.779]  you can go in and every month or every week,
[03:45:15.779 --> 03:45:17.779]  whenever you want, you program it, you just click it,
[03:45:17.779 --> 03:45:19.779]  and then you decide when you want to make a donation.
[03:45:19.779 --> 03:45:20.779]  So please do that as well.
[03:45:20.779 --> 03:45:23.779]  That way we get 95 percent of it after credit card fees,
[03:45:23.779 --> 03:45:25.779]  instead of making 20, 30, 40 percent like we do on the products.
[03:45:25.779 --> 03:45:27.779]  But these really are amazing products.
[03:45:27.779 --> 03:45:29.779]  The big July 4 sale is going on right now.
[03:45:29.779 --> 03:45:32.779]  This is such a critical platform in the fight against the new world order.
[03:45:32.779 --> 03:45:34.779]  The enemies out in the open were vindicated.
[03:45:34.779 --> 03:45:35.779]  People are listening more than ever.
[03:45:35.779 --> 03:45:39.779]  But in this major recession going into depression and with supply chain breakdowns,
[03:45:39.779 --> 03:45:40.779]  I know it's hard.
[03:45:40.779 --> 03:45:41.779]  I know times are tough.
[03:45:41.779 --> 03:45:43.779]  So thank you for your support.
[03:45:43.779 --> 03:45:46.779]  But whatever you do, pray for the broadcast and share the articles and the videos.
[03:45:46.779 --> 03:45:48.779]  That you can do for free.
[03:45:48.779 --> 03:45:50.779]  And that's just as important as keeping us on air.
[03:45:50.779 --> 03:45:53.779]  So however God leads you in your heart to support us, please support us now.
[03:45:53.779 --> 03:45:55.779]  And I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
[03:45:55.779 --> 03:45:56.779]  God bless you.
[03:45:56.779 --> 03:45:59.779]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and War for the World,
[03:45:59.779 --> 03:46:02.779]  is a historic book that documents the globalists in their own words,
[03:46:02.779 --> 03:46:04.779]  plan for our future.
[03:46:04.779 --> 03:46:05.779]  That is a hellish future.
[03:46:05.779 --> 03:46:09.779]  Now you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them,
[03:46:09.779 --> 03:46:12.779]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and War for the World
[03:46:12.779 --> 03:46:15.779]  at bookstores, Amazon, or Infowarshore.com.
[03:46:15.779 --> 03:46:18.779]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book
[03:46:18.779 --> 03:46:20.779]  after the signed copies we got run out.
[03:46:20.779 --> 03:46:23.779]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[03:46:23.779 --> 03:46:26.779]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and War for the World,
[03:46:26.779 --> 03:46:28.779]  a signed copy, at Infowarshore.com.
[03:46:28.779 --> 03:46:32.779]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[03:46:32.779 --> 03:46:35.779]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book.
[03:46:35.779 --> 03:46:38.779]  You'll also know that you help keep Infowars on the air.
[03:46:38.779 --> 03:46:41.779]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book
[03:46:41.779 --> 03:46:42.779]  or unsigned copies.
[03:46:42.779 --> 03:46:46.779]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to Infowarshore.com
[03:46:46.779 --> 03:46:49.779]  and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies
[03:46:49.779 --> 03:46:52.779]  and donate them to the library or give them to the local school.
[03:46:52.779 --> 03:46:53.779]  This is an Infowar.
[03:46:53.779 --> 03:46:55.779]  I'm counting on you, and thank you for your support.
[03:46:56.779 --> 03:47:01.779]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,

[03:47:21.960 --> 03:47:27.600]  We go live Monday through Friday at 7 p.m. Pacific, that's 10 p.m. Eastern, or go follow
[03:47:27.600 --> 03:47:29.160]  me on Twitter at Drew H. Live.
[03:47:29.160 --> 03:47:33.840]  Click the link in my bio and you can find all that great content.
[03:47:33.840 --> 03:47:36.480]  We'll be starting a new show on LFA-TV called Based America.
[03:47:36.480 --> 03:47:38.000]  You guys can find that as well.
[03:47:38.000 --> 03:47:41.480]  Just go search LFA-TV on Rumble.
[03:47:41.480 --> 03:47:42.480]  Some breaking news, guys.
[03:47:42.480 --> 03:47:48.680]  Google to remove Canadian news stories after Trudeau's Online News Act would require platforms
[03:47:48.680 --> 03:47:50.120]  to pay for links.
[03:47:50.120 --> 03:47:56.320]  Bill C-18 will make it harder for Canadians to find news online, make it harder for journalists
[03:47:56.320 --> 03:48:03.280]  to reach their audiences, and reduce valuable free web traffic to Canadian publishers.
[03:48:03.720 --> 03:48:08.960]  And obviously this is all going to be done in the name of combating misinformation, combating
[03:48:08.960 --> 03:48:14.440]  disinformation, combating the errors that are out there from the mega-Republican right-wing
[03:48:14.440 --> 03:48:16.160]  extremists.
[03:48:16.160 --> 03:48:23.320]  And those truckers, those Canadian Nazi truckers, those Nazis that just, they protested our
[03:48:23.320 --> 03:48:27.920]  lockdown measures, those Nazis, how dare that they want freedom?
[03:48:27.920 --> 03:48:32.600]  How dare that they point the finger at me, homosexual Justin Trudeau?
[03:48:32.600 --> 03:48:34.840]  How dare they point the finger at me?
[03:48:34.840 --> 03:48:38.440]  I'm Lord Farquaad, you should all be worshipping me.
[03:48:38.440 --> 03:48:43.240]  If I want you to have news, if I want you to have any form of news that goes outside
[03:48:43.240 --> 03:48:48.880]  my homosexual regime, tyrannical regime, then I will tell you what it can be.
[03:48:48.880 --> 03:48:51.760]  I'll even tell Google what they'll be able to show you.
[03:48:51.760 --> 03:48:54.760]  We know Google's been getting down like this with the CCP.
[03:48:54.760 --> 03:49:00.040]  We know that Google has been obviously manipulating information for the Chinese people, giving
[03:49:00.040 --> 03:49:06.360]  them one perspective, giving them one channel, giving them one centralized ability to see
[03:49:06.360 --> 03:49:10.600]  something that they are wanting them to see.
[03:49:10.600 --> 03:49:12.600]  This is how the regimes function.
[03:49:12.600 --> 03:49:16.760]  And of course we know that homosexual Justin Trudeau, he's just another World Economic
[03:49:16.760 --> 03:49:22.360]  Forum puppet, literally in the hands, this guy loves tyranny, loves Fidel Castro, loves
[03:49:22.360 --> 03:49:28.800]  communism, loves oppression, praises tyrannical leaders right in front of the media, laughs
[03:49:28.800 --> 03:49:36.800]  about it, oh yeah, I love tyranny, I love tyrants, oh yeah, it's totally amazing, right?
[03:49:36.800 --> 03:49:38.840]  That's why they all talk like that.
[03:49:38.840 --> 03:49:42.160]  They love, dude, they are fanboys of Hitler.
[03:49:42.160 --> 03:49:44.200]  They are fanboys of Mao.
[03:49:44.200 --> 03:49:47.880]  They are fanboys, dude, they are fanboys of Stalin.
[03:49:47.880 --> 03:49:51.400]  My God, dude, that's why they all praise the CCP.
[03:49:51.400 --> 03:49:54.600]  They literally worship Xi Jinping, why?
[03:49:54.600 --> 03:49:55.800]  Because he is the model.
[03:49:55.800 --> 03:49:58.080]  Why does Bill Gates call China the model?
[03:49:58.080 --> 03:50:01.080]  Why does Klaus Schwab call China the model?
[03:50:01.080 --> 03:50:05.080]  Okay, so obviously you are going to take a look at Justin Trudeau, little homosexual
[03:50:05.080 --> 03:50:07.800]  right there, and he's going to love them too.
[03:50:07.800 --> 03:50:09.440]  He loves tyranny.
[03:50:09.440 --> 03:50:11.240]  He's going to command Google.
[03:50:11.240 --> 03:50:17.200]  He's going to want Canada to be the same model, oppressing freedom patriots, oppressing the
[03:50:17.200 --> 03:50:24.040]  flow of free information, oppressing the flow of free speech, the flow of the free press.
[03:50:24.040 --> 03:50:26.080]  Because that's a threat to these regimes.
[03:50:26.080 --> 03:50:28.000]  They always will be a threat to these regimes.
[03:50:28.040 --> 03:50:33.400]  You and I will forever be a threat to these regimes, not because we're violent, not because
[03:50:33.400 --> 03:50:39.000]  we want physical hostility, not because we want to go and run around and hurt people.
[03:50:39.000 --> 03:50:42.200]  For the most part, I just want to be left alone, dude.
[03:50:42.200 --> 03:50:43.880]  I just want to be left alone.
[03:50:43.880 --> 03:50:49.680]  I want to live in a Christ-based nation where we got some serious moral laws so that innocence
[03:50:49.680 --> 03:50:55.000]  is preserved and kept safe so we don't have pedophiles running around Seattle with their
[03:50:55.000 --> 03:50:57.840]  penises hanging out in front of little kids.
[03:50:58.600 --> 03:51:06.600]  And lesbians running around with their disgusting hippo whale boobs flapping around in New York City.
[03:51:06.600 --> 03:51:09.600]  Did you guys see that footage from Savannah Hernandez last week?
[03:51:09.600 --> 03:51:17.600]  And you see little boys, little girls running up and down, penises jiggling everywhere, just full-blown Sodom and Gomorrah.
[03:51:17.600 --> 03:51:21.600]  I don't want to live in a society like that. I don't want to live in a world like that.
[03:51:21.600 --> 03:51:25.600]  Christ first. Christ first. Christ first. Let's go.
[03:51:26.600 --> 03:51:32.600]  You see, but they want the opposite. They want the opposite, which is anti-Christ, lawlessness abounding.
[03:51:32.600 --> 03:51:39.600]  So they want a society that's totally centralized, controlled, monitored, so they're always watching.
[03:51:39.600 --> 03:51:41.600]  They're always monitoring.
[03:51:41.200 --> 03:51:49.400]  And, of course, homosexual Justin Trudeau is a total, total New World Order, World Economic
[03:51:49.400 --> 03:51:50.400]  Forum puppet.
[03:51:50.400 --> 03:51:54.680]  Klaus Schwab is always pointing to this guy because that is the model.
[03:51:54.680 --> 03:52:00.100]  They look to China as the overall blueprint, and they want to roll that out across the
[03:52:00.100 --> 03:52:05.640]  entire globe with their so-called New World Order puppet leaders.
[03:52:05.640 --> 03:52:06.800]  It's here in the West, guys.
[03:52:06.800 --> 03:52:08.880]  It's been here in the West.
[03:52:08.880 --> 03:52:09.880]  Tyranny's not coming.
[03:52:10.440 --> 03:52:12.680]  Tyranny's not a conspiracy theory.
[03:52:12.680 --> 03:52:14.680]  Tyranny's not on the way.
[03:52:14.680 --> 03:52:21.660]  The oppression is not a, you know, it's not like we got intel, sir.
[03:52:21.660 --> 03:52:23.240]  The tyrants, they're on their way.
[03:52:23.240 --> 03:52:24.380]  They're in route.
[03:52:24.380 --> 03:52:26.400]  They're coming from across the Atlantic Ocean.
[03:52:26.400 --> 03:52:28.520]  They'll be coming across from the Pacific Ocean.
[03:52:28.520 --> 03:52:30.040]  They'll be hitting our shores soon.
[03:52:30.040 --> 03:52:31.160]  They're in our skies.
[03:52:31.160 --> 03:52:32.160]  They're on the way.
[03:52:32.160 --> 03:52:33.160]  They're in route.
[03:52:33.160 --> 03:52:34.160]  They're in route.
[03:52:34.160 --> 03:52:35.320]  No, they're inside the city gates.
[03:52:35.320 --> 03:52:36.560]  The tyrants are here.
[03:52:36.560 --> 03:52:38.840]  The New World Order's satanic agents are here.
[03:52:38.840 --> 03:52:40.240]  They're in our federal government.
[03:52:40.240 --> 03:52:41.640]  They're in the Democrat Party.
[03:52:41.640 --> 03:52:43.040]  They're in the Republican Party.
[03:52:43.040 --> 03:52:46.440]  The two-tier system, the two-party system is an illusion.
[03:52:46.440 --> 03:52:47.660]  It's part of the matrix.
[03:52:47.660 --> 03:52:53.440]  It's meant to quantify and distill your intellect, lower your IQ to make you think that freedom
[03:52:53.440 --> 03:52:54.840]  is just two choices.
[03:52:55.900 --> 03:52:58.900]  That's what we're dealing with.
[03:52:58.900 --> 03:53:02.900]  It's all a PSYOP. It's all to keep you inside of the matrix.
[03:53:02.900 --> 03:53:06.900]  To keep you controlled. A controlled, simulated environment.
[03:53:06.900 --> 03:53:09.900]  And now with the age of the internet,
[03:53:09.900 --> 03:53:13.900]  and now with the talks at the World Government Summit 2023,
[03:53:13.900 --> 03:53:16.900]  Davos 2023,
[03:53:16.900 --> 03:53:19.900]  talks of mastering technologies to master the universe,
[03:53:19.900 --> 03:53:22.900]  to master the future, they want to master time.
[03:53:22.900 --> 03:53:25.900]  Ladies and gentlemen, they want to master time.
[03:53:25.900 --> 03:53:28.900]  Who's truly the hero of time?
[03:53:28.900 --> 03:53:31.900]  Who's truly the author of time?
[03:53:31.900 --> 03:53:35.900]  Who's truly the architect of time itself that lives outside of time?
[03:53:35.900 --> 03:53:38.900]  It's God. And that's what these people want to be.
[03:53:38.900 --> 03:53:42.900]  That's why they're bringing up, oh, let's just make an economy inside of a VR reality.
[03:53:42.900 --> 03:53:45.900]  Why not? Let's just jack your conscience.
[03:53:45.900 --> 03:53:48.900]  And oh, Yuval Harari, let's just take your conscience.
[03:53:48.900 --> 03:53:51.900]  Let's just jack your conscience into some kind of VR, AR, AI system.
[03:53:51.900 --> 03:53:54.900]  You don't need your body. We don't need human bodies anymore.
[03:53:54.900 --> 03:53:57.900]  We can just create some kind of cyborg body. Take your conscience out.
[03:53:57.900 --> 03:54:00.900]  It's like Man of Steel. Remember the movie Man of Steel?
[03:54:00.900 --> 03:54:03.900]  Superman? Henry Cavill?
[03:54:03.900 --> 03:54:06.900]  His dad, Russell Crowe,
[03:54:06.900 --> 03:54:09.900]  plays Kal-El, Superman's dad.
[03:54:09.900 --> 03:54:12.900]  And he sacrifices himself.
[03:54:12.900 --> 03:54:15.900]  The planet dies. It explodes.
[03:54:15.900 --> 03:54:19.900]  But he downloaded his conscience into the AI-controlled ship.
[03:54:19.900 --> 03:54:22.900]  And the ship flew to planet Earth.
[03:54:22.900 --> 03:54:25.900]  Crash landed.
[03:54:23.900 --> 03:54:24.900]  Right?
[03:54:24.900 --> 03:54:33.060]  Flew to planet Earth, crash landed, and the AI was under the ice in Antarctica for thousands
[03:54:33.060 --> 03:54:38.660]  of years until finally Kal-El, Superman, grew up and his instincts led him there.
[03:54:38.660 --> 03:54:43.539]  He found the ship, and he goes down, and he's having a conversation in the spaceship, the
[03:54:43.539 --> 03:54:48.940]  AI-controlled spaceship, alien spaceship, having a conversation with his dad decades
[03:54:48.940 --> 03:54:49.940]  later.
[03:54:49.940 --> 03:54:52.220]  He's like, Dad, how are you here?
[03:54:52.220 --> 03:54:53.220]  He's like, I'm not.
[03:54:53.539 --> 03:54:57.779]  My conscious was downloaded into the AI programs of this ship, and it's kept my conscious alive
[03:54:57.779 --> 03:55:02.820]  so I could finally, when I had the opportunity to talk to you, I could break down everything
[03:55:02.820 --> 03:55:03.820]  to you.
[03:55:03.820 --> 03:55:04.820]  I don't need my body.
[03:55:04.820 --> 03:55:06.100]  I'm just a hologram now.
[03:55:06.100 --> 03:55:10.740]  That's what they want for us, and the technology is getting closer and closer and closer to
[03:55:10.740 --> 03:55:15.300]  that place because if they could remove your body, you're just a slave to technology.
[03:55:15.300 --> 03:55:17.020]  You're just a slave to the VR.
[03:55:17.020 --> 03:55:18.699]  You're just a slave to the AR.
[03:55:18.699 --> 03:55:20.020]  You're just a slave to the neural link.
[03:55:20.020 --> 03:55:21.020]  You don't need a body.
[03:55:21.020 --> 03:55:22.020]  You don't need a body.
[03:55:22.020 --> 03:55:23.020]  Just take your conscious.
[03:55:23.020 --> 03:55:24.020]  We'll jack you into a system.
[03:55:24.020 --> 03:55:26.539]  Oh, and by the way, the system's controlled by all of us.
[03:55:26.539 --> 03:55:27.740]  We control the AI.
[03:55:27.740 --> 03:55:29.380]  We control the centralized system.
[03:55:29.380 --> 03:55:30.740]  We control the technology.
[03:55:30.740 --> 03:55:34.900]  So your conscious will be forever uploaded into a system, and we'll just control your
[03:55:34.900 --> 03:55:36.220]  entire existence from there.
[03:55:36.220 --> 03:55:37.619]  Your body will do away with it.
[03:55:37.619 --> 03:55:42.220]  If we want to put your conscious into another body, if we feel like it, we'll do it.
[03:55:42.220 --> 03:55:43.699]  That's the whole embodiment of possession.
[03:55:43.699 --> 03:55:47.060]  That's where these people want to go, you guys.
[03:55:47.140 --> 03:55:51.779]  Free conscious, free will is a problem for these people.
[03:55:51.779 --> 03:55:53.720]  That's why they want to control big tech.
[03:55:53.720 --> 03:55:55.740]  That's why they want to control technology.
[03:55:55.740 --> 03:55:58.260]  That's why they want to control any innovative system.
[03:55:58.260 --> 03:56:05.539]  That's why any type of new innovative piece of technology will always, always be immediately
[03:56:05.539 --> 03:56:10.260]  hijacked like that by the New World Order satanic globalists.
[03:56:10.260 --> 03:56:11.260]  Why?
[03:56:11.260 --> 03:56:16.100]  Because they have known for decades, for thousands of years, that those innovative pieces of
[03:56:16.140 --> 03:56:20.420]  technology can be effective for one reason and one reason only.
[03:56:20.420 --> 03:56:25.539]  That's to control your mind, therefore controlling your life.
[03:56:25.539 --> 03:56:27.020]  Guys, this is the info war.
[03:56:27.020 --> 03:56:29.100]  This is the information war.
[03:56:29.100 --> 03:56:32.859]  It's the flow of information by controlling your mind, controlling your psyche, controlling
[03:56:32.859 --> 03:56:35.220]  your conscience.
[03:56:35.220 --> 03:56:40.699]  That's why Homo Trudeau is up there trying to literally command Google what kind of information
[03:56:40.699 --> 03:56:43.940]  is going to come into the country and what's not.
[03:56:43.940 --> 03:56:50.380]  That's why the CCP is doing the exact same thing, incinerating citizens that are politically
[03:56:50.380 --> 03:56:56.180]  problems or threats to the regime that don't comply with locking down.
[03:56:56.180 --> 03:57:01.260]  And they use drones, they use AI facial recognition, they use what?
[03:57:01.260 --> 03:57:05.980]  They use technology to censor and oppress their people.
[03:57:05.980 --> 03:57:12.900]  And guys, I don't want to sound like an out of date old guy or boomer that just doesn't
[03:57:12.900 --> 03:57:13.900]  understand technology.
[03:57:13.900 --> 03:57:16.300]  And what I'm saying is technology can be used for good.
[03:57:16.300 --> 03:57:17.820]  It could be used for evil.
[03:57:17.820 --> 03:57:19.220]  We just got to be careful.
[03:57:19.220 --> 03:57:24.539]  And when we see those who are evil, get their dirty little paws, their dirty little pedophilic
[03:57:24.539 --> 03:57:28.779]  hands on these technologies, don't think that they are going to be for the embattlement
[03:57:28.779 --> 03:57:30.500]  or the empowerment of humanity.
[03:57:30.500 --> 03:57:35.500]  It's going to be to oppress humanity, to be weaponized against humanity, to censor your
[03:57:35.500 --> 03:57:41.500]  voice, censor your entire existence, censor every part of who you are as a human.
[03:57:41.500 --> 03:57:42.500]  My name is Drew Hernandez.

[03:57:44.100 --> 03:57:46.100]  Owen Schreier and the War Room is up next.
[03:57:46.100 --> 03:57:51.300]  Infowarsstore.com is like a grocery store or like a vitamin shop.

[03:58:02.779 --> 03:58:03.779]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[03:58:03.779 --> 03:58:08.859]  And the answer is different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different
[03:58:08.859 --> 03:58:09.940]  people.

[03:58:15.260 --> 03:58:16.260]  They're all very diverse.
[03:58:16.260 --> 03:58:20.820]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller that's been sold for many years
