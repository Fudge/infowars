[00:00.000 --> 00:24.080]  We are on the March the Empire is on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[00:24.080 --> 00:33.680]  Welcome to the Alex Jones show on this Wednesday November 30th 2016 I'm David
[00:33.680 --> 00:38.120]  Knight your host we're gonna be joined in this show with many of the Info Wars
[00:38.120 --> 00:42.600]  reporters Alex is gonna have a report at the bottom of this hour looking at yet
[00:42.600 --> 00:48.400]  another CNN hit piece against Alex Jones and trying to attack Donald Trump
[00:48.400 --> 00:53.480]  but we're going to tell you why their news is fake news and our news is not
[00:53.480 --> 00:57.080]  fake news we're gonna analyze that Alex Jones is gonna do at the bottom of the
[00:57.080 --> 01:00.000]  hour we're gonna talk about it in the next hour and of course it all revolves
[01:00.000 --> 01:05.360]  around the charges of election fraud so we're gonna put some some rubber
[01:05.360 --> 01:08.400]  underneath these accusations this is something that really needs to be
[01:08.400 --> 01:14.960]  examined and of course as we've got Jill Stein and her failed attempt to try to
[01:14.960 --> 01:18.680]  push back against Donald Trump for the person that she said was a criminal
[01:18.680 --> 01:21.760]  Hillary Clinton trying to get Hillary Clinton and very selectively calling for
[01:21.760 --> 01:25.000]  recounts in certain areas and as I pointed out last night the nightly news
[01:25.000 --> 01:30.480]  this same lawyer who is working with the Hillary Clinton camp and Jill Stein
[01:30.480 --> 01:35.000]  had been hired by George Soros to shut down measures that would have stopped
[01:35.000 --> 01:40.040]  voter fraud in North Carolina voter ID that is not racism it is not racism to
[01:40.040 --> 01:44.560]  ask for photo ID everybody asked for it everywhere and there's a lot of places
[01:44.560 --> 01:47.040]  why I don't think it should be asked for one place where I think it should be
[01:47.040 --> 01:51.320]  asked for is at the voting booth and that is not intimidation but of course
[01:51.320 --> 01:55.920]  Soros used the same lawyer to try to shut that down and the same lawyer is now
[01:55.920 --> 02:00.120]  saying that in North Carolina where there is I believe last time I looked
[02:00.120 --> 02:04.680]  it was less than 5,000 vote difference between the Republican and Democrat for
[02:04.680 --> 02:07.520]  governor there that is very close that is something that does need to be looked
[02:07.520 --> 02:11.480]  at carefully does need to have a recount but he says don't do it there but in the
[02:11.480 --> 02:15.840]  areas where there are tens of thousands of votes separating them the kind of
[02:15.840 --> 02:19.920]  margins that we've never seen overturned by a recount they want to push ahead for
[02:19.920 --> 02:23.560]  their own political reasons and we've told you this before what's behind this
[02:23.560 --> 02:28.160]  is to try to delegitimize the election for Donald Trump because as always been
[02:28.160 --> 02:31.160]  a strategy of Soros and his color revolutions throughout the former
[02:31.160 --> 02:35.280]  Soviet Union and other places where he's done that they're gonna use that to
[02:35.280 --> 02:40.000]  inspire the social justice warrior college students to get violent on the
[02:40.000 --> 02:42.960]  street there's two parts it's no legitimate election and this guy is an
[02:42.960 --> 02:47.400]  authoritarian so as a result we see the types of things that CNN is doing trying
[02:47.400 --> 02:52.200]  to paint Donald Trump as a racist trying to connect him with Ku Klux Klan also
[02:52.200 --> 02:55.360]  doing the same thing to Alex Jones actually put up a picture of Alex Jones
[02:55.360 --> 03:00.240]  with a banner underneath that same former KKK leader I mean that's the kind
[03:00.240 --> 03:04.280]  of dirty subliminal and not even I guess you couldn't even say that's
[03:04.280 --> 03:08.280]  subliminal I mean that's just overt there but it's putting a message out there
[03:08.280 --> 03:12.360]  that is absolutely alive so Alex is gonna talk about that at the bottom of the
[03:12.360 --> 03:15.480]  hour but of course we've got a lot of news today that we're talking about we've
[03:15.480 --> 03:21.560]  had a picked for Treasury Secretary Mnuchin who has been the finance
[03:21.560 --> 03:26.520]  campaign manager for the Donald Trump campaign since May I believe it was
[03:26.520 --> 03:30.200]  of course he has connections to Goldman Sachs that concerns a lot of people but
[03:30.200 --> 03:34.920]  I'm gonna play you some of the clips today as he announced that he's gonna be
[03:34.920 --> 03:38.240]  Treasury Secretary people talk to him what his priorities are going to be it
[03:38.240 --> 03:42.960]  looks like he is going right down the economic list of Donald Trump and
[03:42.960 --> 03:47.440]  that's a very good thing we still don't have an answer on Mitt Romney we're gonna
[03:47.440 --> 03:50.240]  look at some of these conservative picks we're gonna look a little bit more detail
[03:50.240 --> 03:55.440]  about Tom Price Politico says he's got he's a radical conservative and he has
[03:55.440 --> 03:59.280]  a radically conservative vision for American healthcare well I think that's
[03:59.280 --> 04:02.480]  good when Politico says that you're a radical conservative that means you got
[04:02.480 --> 04:06.320]  principles that means that you're going to try to establish a marketplace which
[04:06.320 --> 04:10.160]  again is why Donald Trump ran on and we're gonna talk about that some of the
[04:10.160 --> 04:16.280]  news that surfaced about him also we've got OPEC cutting their output in a bid
[04:16.280 --> 04:22.200]  to try to get rid of the oversupply of oil I don't think they really need to do
[04:22.200 --> 04:25.040]  that I think what's going to happen is we're going to see a lot of economic
[04:25.040 --> 04:28.480]  growth if Donald Trump's economic policies go through and we're gonna tell
[04:28.480 --> 04:32.200]  you why that's gonna happen but I think they also kind of missed the idea that
[04:32.200 --> 04:36.480]  you know we had about a week or so ago there was this massive discovery of oil
[04:36.480 --> 04:41.320]  in West Texas they're not going to be able to control the market by trying to
[04:41.320 --> 04:44.360]  dry up the supply of oil ain't gonna happen and they're not going to be able
[04:44.360 --> 04:48.280]  to do it politically either because Donald Trump is going to unleash our
[04:48.280 --> 04:53.320]  economic engine here in this country stay with us gonna be right back
[04:53.320 --> 05:03.480]  there's currently a war going on in this country and it's waged against
[05:03.480 --> 05:08.320]  Breitbart infowars and Drudge in large part because of Trump's victory now the
[05:08.320 --> 05:12.920]  latest example of this Apple is purging Breitbart news app from its iTunes
[05:12.920 --> 05:16.360]  store we have an article that's up on our website written by Dan layman this
[05:16.360 --> 05:20.280]  latest move Apple has removed Breitbart news app from their iTunes marketplace
[05:20.280 --> 05:24.320]  it's an utter censorship of free speech and truth journalism they're kicking
[05:24.320 --> 05:28.560]  it into overdrive despite the app being available for the past three years now
[05:28.560 --> 05:33.800]  Breitbart currently ranks 28th on similar webs top 100 media sites and they had
[05:33.800 --> 05:38.000]  over a hundred and sixty eight million page views in October alone but their
[05:38.000 --> 05:41.440]  primary target for a massive concerted effort by these globalists is to
[05:41.440 --> 05:46.640]  suppress and silence all opposition deemed quote fake news including us now
[05:46.640 --> 05:50.240]  the war on Breitbart has increased because of CEO Steve Bannon who was
[05:50.240 --> 05:53.960]  ultimately appointed as the White House chief strategist in this latest move
[05:53.960 --> 05:57.960]  they're trying to silence all real news I'm Margaret Hal reporting for info

[08:15.400 --> 08:20.200]  welcome to the Alex Jones show on this Wednesday November 30th 2016 I'm David
[08:20.200 --> 08:23.640]  Knight your host here we had an interesting day yesterday and we're
[08:23.640 --> 08:26.040]  gonna talk about some of the things that happened there and of course we've had
[08:26.040 --> 08:30.280]  an interesting day already this morning we've seen Donald Trump announced his
[08:30.280 --> 08:35.920]  pick for Treasury Secretary we're gonna have Roger Stone joining us in the third
[08:35.920 --> 08:38.680]  and fourth hour today and of course he's gonna be talking a lot about the
[08:38.680 --> 08:42.560]  Trump transition team and the picks that we've already seen I'm sure that he's
[08:42.560 --> 08:46.960]  gonna have a lot to say about that what we can expect to see going forward we're
[08:46.960 --> 08:51.160]  also going to have our reporters joining us in the second hour and we're gonna be
[08:51.160 --> 08:55.480]  talking Alex has a report at the bottom of the hour there's another hit piece on
[08:55.480 --> 08:59.680]  Alex Jones on CNN yesterday we're gonna show you that we're going to talk about
[08:59.680 --> 09:03.520]  their tactics and we're also going to talk about the reality that they don't
[09:03.520 --> 09:08.000]  want to face and that is that there really is voter fraud yes there's two
[09:08.000 --> 09:14.160]  levels of fraud there's voter fraud where you have people who can register to
[09:14.160 --> 09:18.040]  vote who are not technically qualified to vote because they're not citizens or
[09:18.040 --> 09:21.640]  citizens of another country not a citizen of this country they haven't
[09:21.640 --> 09:25.640]  gone through the legal process to do that you can also have people who vote
[09:25.640 --> 09:30.240]  multiple times because they don't need to have a voter ID and of course that
[09:30.240 --> 09:33.960]  happens that happens in places like North Carolina and of course isn't the
[09:33.960 --> 09:39.040]  run-up to the election in Virginia there were a large number of people that
[09:39.040 --> 09:41.880]  were turned in in one particular county if you remember we talked about this at
[09:41.880 --> 09:46.320]  the time they turned in this list of people and one of the people in the
[09:46.320 --> 09:51.320]  registrar's office recognized by the name she said wait a minute I know that
[09:51.320 --> 09:55.440]  guy he just died he was I think a judge in that county and he just died and so
[09:55.440 --> 09:59.160]  they turned his name in to be registered to vote that's the type of thing we're
[09:59.160 --> 10:02.400]  going to be talking about in the second hour the reality of voter fraud but of
[10:02.400 --> 10:07.280]  course there's also the reality of the even larger scheme and that is using
[10:07.280 --> 10:12.800]  electronic voting removing the ability to audit the votes which we saw the
[10:12.800 --> 10:17.160]  director of elections here in Texas do and that's one of the things that they're
[10:17.160 --> 10:22.440]  trying that they're discovering here with Jill Stein's quixotic quest to tie
[10:22.440 --> 10:26.680]  the system up it's not really there to try to reform the system she was
[10:26.680 --> 10:31.080]  completely silent about all these different forms of fraud before the
[10:31.080 --> 10:33.800]  election she's got her own agenda we understand that and of course she's
[10:33.800 --> 10:37.640]  already failed because she missed the deadline in Pennsylvania by a week
[10:37.640 --> 10:42.000]  according to the election officials in Pennsylvania she's clueless about how
[10:42.000 --> 10:46.960]  this entire system works she can't even read the regulations for filing her
[10:46.960 --> 10:50.040]  objections she certainly doesn't understand the Electoral College we're
[10:50.040 --> 10:52.280]  going to be talking about that we're gonna be talking about the Trump
[10:52.280 --> 10:56.360]  transition team before we get into that before we talk about Mnuchin who was
[10:56.360 --> 11:01.400]  picked today for Treasury Secretary and I think it's a very positive choice so
[11:01.400 --> 11:04.800]  far even though he's got connections to Goldman Sachs and I understand people's
[11:04.800 --> 11:08.800]  concerns about that I think it's a very positive choice when he came out and
[11:08.800 --> 11:11.760]  talked about this today you could see that he was exactly on the same page
[11:11.760 --> 11:16.400]  with Donald Trump and I think Trump understands that the economic issue is
[11:16.400 --> 11:20.560]  number one front and center and that economic issue is jobs and so yesterday
[11:20.560 --> 11:24.560]  we saw although it began at the beginning of the day with an attack on
[11:24.560 --> 11:28.080]  constitutional freedoms talking about burning flags it ended at the end of the
[11:28.080 --> 11:33.200]  day with him talking about how he had saved jobs by doing a deal with carrier
[11:33.200 --> 11:37.200]  we're gonna talk about that what is that deal we don't know the details of the
[11:37.200 --> 11:42.240]  deal yet but I gotta say that people looked at this and it got a lot of
[11:42.240 --> 11:45.400]  people upset about the flag burning thing I don't like what he had to say
[11:45.400 --> 11:50.360]  about the flag burning thing but I and we'll talk about that but this is
[11:50.360 --> 11:53.560]  exactly what I thought we would see from Donald Trump I thought he'd saved jobs
[11:53.560 --> 11:57.200]  and he'd attack constitutional freedoms now Hillary Clinton would have attacked
[11:57.200 --> 12:00.720]  constitutional freedoms and not saved jobs she would have sent them abroad so
[12:00.720 --> 12:04.880]  that's a positive thing but I think it's also positive when we look at the way
[12:04.880 --> 12:08.360]  that he came out to attack us would you rather have somebody like Barack
[12:08.360 --> 12:11.800]  Obama or Hillary Clinton who's all smiles and handshakes about the
[12:11.800 --> 12:17.160]  Constitution to your face who tell you that they're all for mom apple pie and
[12:17.160 --> 12:22.480]  freedom of speech and then behind the scenes they work very diligently to
[12:22.480 --> 12:26.080]  shut down freedom of speech and of course we have a news item today on
[12:26.080 --> 12:30.840]  info wars.com how Apple is purging Breitbart news from its iTunes store
[12:30.840 --> 12:34.640]  again this is the fake news narrative we'll be talking about that more later
[12:34.640 --> 12:37.920]  in the show but would you rather have somebody who uses the federal election
[12:37.920 --> 12:42.360]  commission as they've talked about to try to shut down free speech or to do
[12:42.360 --> 12:47.600]  things with the internet accusing people of being terrorists or whatever to try
[12:47.600 --> 12:49.960]  to shut down the internet all the different things that Hillary Clinton
[12:49.960 --> 12:53.680]  and Obama would do to shut down the internet or would you have somebody who
[12:53.680 --> 13:00.040]  comes out in a very brute force insult to the First Amendment he puts
[13:00.040 --> 13:03.280]  everybody on guard and we get to talk about what the principles are that are
[13:03.280 --> 13:06.360]  involved in it I think that's a more positive way to do this and he has no
[13:06.360 --> 13:10.240]  way that he's going to get this enforced so when he comes out and he talks
[13:10.240 --> 13:14.800]  about this he does it in a very crude way and again it's a dog whistle to his
[13:14.800 --> 13:21.880]  base and it's also a reflection of his past history I think that what he was
[13:21.880 --> 13:24.600]  doing yesterday was he's showing his base look I'm going to be there for you
[13:24.600 --> 13:27.640]  I'm going to get jobs and for those of you who are with the military who were
[13:27.640 --> 13:31.160]  the police that I support I'm going to talk about the flag it just kind of came
[13:31.160 --> 13:34.760]  out of nowhere there weren't any riots going on yesterday to start this but in
[13:34.760 --> 13:40.080]  both of these cases he is talking to his base saying I'm going to stay with the
[13:40.080 --> 13:46.160]  things that you elected me to do I want to look at the situation with the the
[13:46.160 --> 13:50.600]  war on on the flag first now let's let's talk about the jobs first let's talk
[13:50.600 --> 13:55.160]  about the jobs yesterday evening we had the deal with Carrier that they said
[13:55.160 --> 13:59.080]  was going to be announced and the tweets that came out from Carrier first
[13:59.080 --> 14:03.280]  they said we are pleased to reach a deal with President-elect Trump and Vice
[14:03.280 --> 14:08.800]  President-elect Pence to keep close to 1,000 jobs in Indianapolis more details
[14:08.800 --> 14:14.240]  soon then President-elect Trump said I will be going to Indiana on Thursday to
[14:14.240 --> 14:17.080]  make a major announcement concerning carrier air conditioning staying in
[14:17.080 --> 14:21.440]  Indianapolis great deal for workers big day on Thursday for Indiana and the
[14:21.440 --> 14:25.480]  great workers of that wonderful state we will keep your our company and jobs in
[14:25.480 --> 14:30.400]  the US thanks Carrier so we're going to find out what that the details of that
[14:30.400 --> 14:34.800]  DLR but remember on Thanksgiving Day Donald Trump said hey I'm working even
[14:34.800 --> 14:39.000]  on Thanksgiving Day to get Carrier to keep their facility in the United
[14:39.000 --> 14:43.320]  States and I think that's amazing everybody that knows Trump and you can
[14:43.320 --> 14:46.400]  see this look at how hard he worked during the campaign compared to Hillary
[14:46.400 --> 14:50.280]  Clinton for example who could barely stand up he was flying crisscrossing the
[14:50.280 --> 14:55.560]  country holding multiple giant events a lot of energy and we have seen a couple
[14:55.560 --> 15:00.840]  of very positive signs while he's not even elected president he's hit the
[15:00.840 --> 15:04.760]  ground running already doing things like this as his Treasury pick
[15:04.760 --> 15:09.600]  Mnuchin said I haven't seen a president do that for a very long time I I can't
[15:09.600 --> 15:14.360]  remember a president trying to keep jobs in America not in my lifetime I don't
[15:14.360 --> 15:17.880]  yeah I don't think Mnuchin's any older than I am but I haven't ever seen a
[15:17.880 --> 15:22.520]  president try to do anything to keep jobs in his country so it's Richard Nixon
[15:22.520 --> 15:27.120]  we have had campaign who had presidents who have been campaigning to take jobs
[15:27.120 --> 15:31.360]  out of this country I mean that's been the reality of what's behind this opening
[15:31.360 --> 15:35.720]  to China with Kissinger the NAFTA trade deals and trade deals with China they
[15:35.720 --> 15:39.960]  have been working very hard to get jobs out of this country to get foreign
[15:39.960 --> 15:44.280]  workers into this country to take your jobs that's been what we have seen
[15:44.280 --> 15:47.880]  before so the fact that he hit the ground running with this the fact that he
[15:47.880 --> 15:51.320]  has been successful I think that's very important what kind of a deal did he do
[15:51.320 --> 15:56.520]  I hope it's not a situation where he is giving them financial incentives
[15:56.520 --> 15:59.760]  crony capitalism to stay here we've seen this with Elon Musk getting billions
[15:59.760 --> 16:05.520]  of dollars many cases it typically the way this works out on state levels these
[16:05.520 --> 16:10.160]  guys get so much in terms of tax benefits and subsidies and other things
[16:10.160 --> 16:14.200]  that it works out costing the taxpayer hundreds of thousands of dollars for
[16:14.200 --> 16:18.120]  every job that is theoretically created I hope that's not the situation here I
[16:18.120 --> 16:21.800]  hope that he picked up the phone with them and said look we're gonna set up a
[16:21.800 --> 16:25.880]  situation where we're going to not have favorable tariffs for people who
[16:25.880 --> 16:31.120]  manufacture outside of our country and oh by the way there's this other thing
[16:31.120 --> 16:35.240]  that's happening throughout the world back in the middle of September if you
[16:35.240 --> 16:41.240]  remember Obama and John Kerry went to Rwanda and they signed an agreement with
[16:41.240 --> 16:45.800]  most of the other countries of the world saying they're gonna get rid of air
[16:45.800 --> 16:49.800]  conditioning coolant I told my sons at the time that happened I said hey guys
[16:49.800 --> 16:54.120]  be ready to live in a world without air conditioning and my sons Lance said
[16:54.120 --> 16:59.600]  from my cold dead hands exactly but that's what they want to do they want to
[16:59.600 --> 17:05.960]  shut down all freon forms all coolants and understand that what's really
[17:05.960 --> 17:10.800]  behind this is that there's a couple of people with connections to government
[17:10.800 --> 17:15.920]  here in America who and in China who have come up with a new replacement for
[17:15.920 --> 17:19.880]  the coolants that we're currently using so they would like to have a monopoly on
[17:19.880 --> 17:23.680]  that they would like everybody to be forced to buy that that's usually what
[17:23.680 --> 17:28.680]  is behind all of this stuff all of these unicorn fart regulations and I call it
[17:28.680 --> 17:33.240]  unicorn farts today we see in California they're seriously going to try to
[17:33.240 --> 17:40.240]  regulate cow farts so it's not as strange as things look reality gets even
[17:40.240 --> 17:44.080]  stranger but I hope he explained to them that it's going to be in their interest
[17:44.080 --> 17:48.960]  that they can manufacture air conditioning units that use real freon in
[17:48.960 --> 17:51.680]  the United States for the United States market because we're not going to go
[17:51.680 --> 17:56.080]  down that ridiculous road that the rest of the world is doing so hey guys if you
[17:56.080 --> 18:00.720]  put your factory in another country maybe you're gonna have some problems
[18:00.720 --> 18:04.160]  without other country in terms of regulations maybe you know they could get
[18:04.160 --> 18:08.080]  around that by putting the freon in when it gets in the United States but he's
[18:08.080 --> 18:12.160]  also going to put some taxes on as it passes across the border so hopefully
[18:12.160 --> 18:15.760]  it was done in that kind of vein hopefully it is not a crony capitalism
[18:15.760 --> 18:19.320]  thing but let's talk about the flag issue because Donald Trump has been in
[18:19.320 --> 18:23.800]  flag wars before remember the flag war that he had in Palm Beach County and
[18:23.800 --> 18:28.800]  this was something I went back into the way back machine flashback this is a
[18:28.800 --> 18:32.600]  political article about it they're talking about the regulatory environment
[18:32.600 --> 18:36.080]  there in Palm Beach they said first you need to know Palm Beach is a town where
[18:36.080 --> 18:40.440]  measurements matter leaf blowers require inspectors to verify that they emit no
[18:40.440 --> 18:44.800]  more than 65 decibels from 50 feet away they regulate the amount of noise of
[18:44.800 --> 18:49.480]  leaf blowers they hold people who are having garage sales are restricted to one
[18:49.480 --> 18:52.960]  sign that could be no more than four square feet in size and residents who
[18:52.960 --> 18:56.920]  are flying flags on their property are restricted to flag poles no higher than
[18:56.920 --> 19:02.600]  42 feet flags that are a maximum of four feet by six feet that's the kind of
[19:02.600 --> 19:07.720]  regulations that they have it he was fined $5,000 because he replaced a
[19:07.720 --> 19:11.920]  section of dead hedges with new hedges that were alive but they weren't quite
[19:11.920 --> 19:16.280]  tall enough so the town of Palm Beach put that on him I mean why would you want
[19:16.280 --> 19:20.520]  to live in a place like that but I'm sure that got under his skin and that's a
[19:20.520 --> 19:24.400]  great thing when you got a president who has seen excessive regulation I think
[19:24.400 --> 19:27.360]  so one of the reasons why he tweeted out I'm gonna get rid about 70% of the
[19:27.360 --> 19:30.880]  regulations I don't know you know put it to put a number on it like that he
[19:30.880 --> 19:34.880]  doesn't have an exact number but there is a lot to be cut there so we're gonna
[19:34.880 --> 19:39.080]  talk about his war in support of the flag we're gonna talk about the story
[19:39.080 --> 19:43.640]  that's on info wars calm a Navy home a Navy vets home was vandalized and
[19:43.640 --> 19:48.280]  torched by anti-trump extremists and then we'll talk about this burning of the

[24:12.800 --> 24:16.960]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your host I want to get
[24:16.960 --> 24:22.240]  back to this issue of flag burning as I said yesterday we began yesterday we
[24:22.240 --> 24:26.560]  saw exactly what I expected to see from Donald Trump jobs being saved here in
[24:26.560 --> 24:31.360]  America even before he becomes president and again another attack against some
[24:31.360 --> 24:36.120]  constitutional freedoms and I want to tell you that this is part of a struggle
[24:36.120 --> 24:39.680]  that he's been working with a long time I'll talk about his fight with Palm Beach
[24:39.680 --> 24:44.840]  on trying to fly the flag there and of course that was a fight where he was
[24:44.840 --> 24:48.760]  definitely on the right side they were trying to shut down his free expression
[24:48.760 --> 24:52.120]  in terms of flying that flag we're also going to talk about a Navy vet whose home
[24:52.120 --> 24:58.000]  was vandalized and torched by anti-trump extremists so they didn't you know you
[24:58.000 --> 25:02.320]  want to talk about people burning flags and then getting attacked well he put up
[25:02.320 --> 25:06.480]  a sign and they burned his home so let's put some things in perspective we're
[25:06.480 --> 25:10.160]  going to talk about the principles involved here and how this is playing out
[25:10.160 --> 25:12.880]  before we do real quickly I just want to let you know that we've got some
[25:12.880 --> 25:16.720]  extended sales that are going to be ending today this is the last day of

[26:19.200 --> 26:23.800]  pointing out before we went to the break in Palm Beach highly regulated industry
[26:23.800 --> 26:28.080]  and that's a good thing for a president to be fighting back against that and
[26:28.080 --> 26:31.960]  that's what he did and he fought against them on the flag issue he had been
[26:31.960 --> 26:36.200]  penalized by them $5,000 as a point out for cutting down a dead hedge and then
[26:36.200 --> 26:38.400]  putting up on there was alive and they said well it's not as high as it was
[26:38.400 --> 26:42.360]  before so here's a $5,000 fine can you imagine living somewhere like that and
[26:42.360 --> 26:45.920]  then they regulate everything from the amount of noise that your leaf blower
[26:45.920 --> 26:50.280]  has to the size that your garage sale sign can be and of course the height and
[26:50.280 --> 26:54.560]  the size of your flag well he completely ignored that he put up an 80-foot flag
[26:54.560 --> 27:00.280]  pole in the front of on of Mar-a-Lago they said he had a car dealership sized
[27:00.280 --> 27:04.880]  American flag 15 feet by 25 feet flying from it and he knew what he was doing
[27:04.880 --> 27:09.200]  says political and he did it was a protest okay Trump had been fighting
[27:09.200 --> 27:12.080]  with the town poobahs from the very moment he got there as they point out on
[27:12.080 --> 27:17.760]  Politico and he was plainly inviting a lawsuit and Trump said this he went on
[27:17.760 --> 27:22.120]  Nancy Grace's show and said the town council Palm Beach should be ashamed of
[27:22.120 --> 27:26.360]  itself for putting regulations and finding me for putting up the American
[27:26.360 --> 27:31.280]  flag this is probably a first in the US history they started finding him
[27:31.280 --> 27:35.920]  several hundred dollars a day the fine grew to $120,000 and then he filed a
[27:35.920 --> 27:39.960]  lawsuit against Palm Beach asking for $25 million in damages and let me say
[27:39.960 --> 27:43.920]  this I've lived in some places where there are a lot of regulations on signs
[27:43.920 --> 27:47.680]  and other things in North Carolina but they always made exceptions for sought
[27:47.680 --> 27:51.680]  for flags especially for the American flags some places would exempt all
[27:51.680 --> 27:57.200]  flags some but pretty much all of them in North Carolina would exempt the
[27:57.200 --> 28:00.200]  American flag so you see it flying so much at car dealerships because it gets
[28:00.200 --> 28:06.240]  attention and it gets around the the regulations on their own signs but you
[28:06.240 --> 28:10.600]  know flying a flag is political speech and he exercised that and he prevailed
[28:10.600 --> 28:17.400]  he they essentially did a deal as Donald Trump does they waived $120,000 worth
[28:17.400 --> 28:21.760]  of fines that they had done and he agreed to give $100,000 to veterans
[28:21.760 --> 28:27.280]  charities and it worked out and he made his point and that's the whole point
[28:27.280 --> 28:31.960]  that we're looking at here you have to understand that when we talk about the
[28:31.960 --> 28:38.000]  flag and if you say that it is a symbol of our Constitution a symbol of the free
[28:38.000 --> 28:44.000]  speech that you fought for I agree but we have to not destroy the thing itself
[28:44.000 --> 28:49.680]  in order to protect the symbol of the thing you understand the real thing is
[28:49.680 --> 28:55.240]  free political speech and burning a flag is political speech Justice Scalia
[28:55.240 --> 29:01.440]  said that as well and so we know that you know when you put that out there we
[29:01.440 --> 29:04.080]  don't want somebody getting their home burn because their political speech we
[29:04.080 --> 29:07.600]  don't want somebody getting attacked because they're wearing a Donald Trump
[29:07.600 --> 29:11.560]  hat or getting their car destroyed at a rally we don't want to see that
[29:11.560 --> 29:15.120]  happening and we don't want to see threats from people like Joe Manchin
[29:15.120 --> 29:18.440]  saying yeah you can burn a flag but then I'm going to punch you out or Donald
[29:18.440 --> 29:21.080]  Trump saying we're gonna take your citizenship or put you in jail that
[29:21.080 --> 29:25.080]  isn't going to happen it's good that we can have that kind of discussion though
[29:25.080 --> 29:28.680]  and I'm glad that it is a frontal attack understand the other people would have
[29:28.680 --> 29:31.800]  done that as well when we come back from the break Alex Jones is going to talk
[29:31.800 --> 29:37.920]  about the latest attack from CNN trying to paint us as fake news no their news
[29:37.920 --> 29:41.400]  is fake about voter fraud you'll be right back with us right at the bottom
[29:41.400 --> 29:44.200]  after we come back from break
[29:44.200 --> 29:58.360]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[29:59.680 --> 30:04.120]  in yet another disgusting example of the crimes committed against Trump
[30:04.120 --> 30:07.560]  supporters we have an article that's up on our website written by Paul Joseph
[30:07.560 --> 30:11.720]  Watson entitled Navy Vets home vandalized torched by quote anti-Trump
[30:11.720 --> 30:15.520]  extremists now I'm talking about a Navy veteran with two young children at home
[30:15.520 --> 30:19.600]  his house was vandalized with anti-Trump graffiti and racial slurs both
[30:19.600 --> 30:23.120]  inside and out before they torch the place and yet another shocking example
[30:23.120 --> 30:27.600]  of anti-Trump hate crimes sweeping the country since we've seen Trump's victory
[30:27.600 --> 30:31.320]  now the veteran Matthew Smith who flies three flags in front of his house in
[30:31.320 --> 30:35.800]  Plant City, Florida which are the American flag the POW flag and the US Navy
[30:35.800 --> 30:39.640]  flag says that he was targeted for his quote political beliefs we should be
[30:39.640 --> 30:43.440]  figuring out our problems together now the word cracker was spray-painted in
[30:43.440 --> 30:47.160]  his house and this suggests that the crime was racially motivated most
[30:47.160 --> 30:50.720]  likely carried out by Black Lives Matter supporters to make matters worse
[30:50.720 --> 30:54.560]  Ms. home isn't foreclosure and they have no insurance to cover the belongings
[30:54.560 --> 30:58.200]  that were utterly destroyed in this fire I'm Margaret hell reporting for

[33:21.400 --> 33:27.280]  David Knight your host we're gonna have Alex pushing back against the CNN attack
[33:27.280 --> 33:30.640]  on him yesterday but of course we have another article on info wars.com today
[33:30.640 --> 33:36.120]  showing how this is stacking up Apple has purged Breitbart news is app from the
[33:36.120 --> 33:42.160]  iTunes store. See everywhere we look we're seeing this kind of censorship this
[33:42.160 --> 33:46.400]  is the pushback they're they're using the fake news the hoax news labeling
[33:46.400 --> 33:49.440]  Breitbart labeling info wars is that because they've pushed out the
[33:49.440 --> 33:54.400]  conspiracy theory for so long calling people that that it hasn't worked so
[33:54.400 --> 33:57.480]  they're gonna come up with a new term that was something of course that if you
[33:57.480 --> 34:03.440]  question the official story going back to JFK we have the FBI CIA government
[34:03.440 --> 34:07.560]  coming out saying other conspiracy theorists I don't believe that one guy
[34:07.560 --> 34:13.560]  with a gun could get all those different angles on the president but we have this
[34:13.560 --> 34:16.920]  magic bullet theory and forget the witnesses that were there that heard
[34:16.920 --> 34:19.960]  shots from the front forget the Zapruder film forget all that stuff if you do
[34:19.960 --> 34:23.640]  that you're a conspiracy theorist they have used that to gaslight people for
[34:23.640 --> 34:29.680]  60 years is it now what's the let's say it was 50 years I think and so it's about
[34:29.680 --> 34:32.880]  53 years I think so they've used that it's getting old it really got old this
[34:32.880 --> 34:36.920]  last time so now they're going to fake news now they are purging news that's
[34:36.920 --> 34:41.240]  and of course Apple setting up their own news filters Facebook setting up their
[34:41.240 --> 34:45.560]  own news filters that is a very important but very subtle attack but
[34:45.560 --> 34:50.520]  there's a more open attack on free speech and on the news outlets that really
[34:50.520 --> 34:55.200]  did carry the day like info wars like Breitbart and that's what we're going to
[34:55.200 --> 34:59.680]  play for you coming up from Alex in just one moment one of the things I think is
[34:59.680 --> 35:03.560]  important okay there's also some breaking news I just I just asked the guys
[35:03.560 --> 35:06.560]  during the break if they'd had the vote for Pelosi you know they look like they
[35:06.560 --> 35:09.000]  were gonna have their own transition team with the Democrats as well but it
[35:09.000 --> 35:16.600]  looks like she won that and is gonna remain as a minority leader in the
[35:16.600 --> 35:21.480]  house we look at the pushback on Donald Trump in terms of trying to divest
[35:21.480 --> 35:26.760]  himself of business stuff everybody forgets how Nancy Pelosi used all these
[35:26.760 --> 35:30.640]  different issues to ingratiate herself but we're gonna talk about that more
[35:30.640 --> 35:37.480]  let's go to Alex talking about the CNN report that aired last night it's been a
[35:37.480 --> 35:43.040]  cozy relationship from the beginning I will not let you down you will be very
[35:43.040 --> 35:48.200]  very impressed I hope and I think we'll be speaking a lot but Donald Trump and
[35:48.200 --> 35:53.400]  Alex Jones the conservative conspiracy theorist and operator of the website
[35:53.400 --> 35:59.200]  info wars which seems to be a place where Trump gets a lot of his information
[35:59.200 --> 36:03.800]  Jones can take credit for spearheading some of the most outrageous theories on
[36:03.800 --> 36:08.720]  the internet from claims that 9-11 was a government conspiracy to the sandy hook
[36:08.720 --> 36:13.680]  shooting being faked Jones theories reach tens of millions each month and
[36:13.680 --> 36:18.960]  are now often echoed by the next president of the United States the
[36:18.960 --> 36:25.280]  controlled corporate fake press after losing the election three weeks ago has
[36:25.280 --> 36:29.920]  only massively intensified their deception campaign against the American
[36:29.920 --> 36:36.480]  people they are now censoring info wars calm red report calm out of major
[36:36.480 --> 36:41.960]  libraries out of Wi-Fi being provided across the country and the world they're
[36:41.960 --> 36:48.120]  putting out fake news lists and then those sites are being delisted right
[36:48.120 --> 36:55.880]  Bart had its app just deleted out of the iTunes store we've had things like that
[36:55.880 --> 37:00.920]  done to us as well this is unprecedented was taking place now I started
[37:00.920 --> 37:07.760]  getting calls yesterday afternoon when I was driving home at about six with
[37:07.760 --> 37:12.280]  people saying yeah they just flashed it up on TV coming up the man that Bob
[37:12.280 --> 37:16.760]  Trump gets his info from and they said it sat under it KKK leader in the
[37:16.760 --> 37:22.200]  promos but by the time that show actually came on they weren't showing the
[37:22.200 --> 37:27.080]  KKK leader garbage but here's why this is important it's done not subliminally
[37:27.080 --> 37:32.760]  but in plain view so I call it kind of quasi-subliminal which is total yellow
[37:32.760 --> 37:40.320]  journalism on multiple levels it says former KKK leader endorses Stephen
[37:40.320 --> 37:48.200]  Bannon and then it's under me under Alice Jones under my face from a video
[37:48.200 --> 37:52.480]  about a completely separate subject and then they pop up the name Alex Jones
[37:52.480 --> 38:00.400]  under it so if you're a TV viewer we're showing you that right now so this is
[38:00.400 --> 38:07.240]  how they deceive this is how they manipulate this is how stupid they
[38:07.240 --> 38:12.720]  think their readers their viewers are I mean this is unprecedented the one of
[38:12.720 --> 38:16.080]  their time I saw him do something like this was Fox and it was Bill O'Reilly
[38:16.080 --> 38:19.160]  talking about sexual predators online and then cut to a video of me yelling
[38:19.160 --> 38:22.680]  about corrupt government had nothing to do with it with my face turning red you
[38:22.680 --> 38:26.200]  know what it's like to go to sleep every night knowing you work for a bunch of psychotic killers
[38:26.200 --> 38:30.200]  and you bastards are probably gonna end up killing me one day hate speech now
[38:30.200 --> 38:35.160]  Facebook is apologizing for allowing it worldwide but can anything be done to
[38:35.160 --> 38:41.200]  stop the hatred which is directly linked into the IRS Tea Party scandal Facebook
[38:41.200 --> 38:45.240]  having a terrible problem with that and recently hatred against women has caused
[38:45.240 --> 38:49.320]  a major controversy postings have encouraged violence rape other
[38:49.320 --> 38:53.800]  atrocities against women hate speech is not a difficult thing to identify it's
[38:53.800 --> 38:58.920]  based on personal attacks designed to injure that's hate speech and Facebook
[38:58.920 --> 39:04.600]  knows so it's just say the word child molester it shows my face or say the word
[39:04.600 --> 39:10.480]  KKK it shows my face it is the lowest level of just baseless disinfo and
[39:10.480 --> 39:16.000]  again I say it's almost subliminal because you're just there watching the
[39:16.000 --> 39:20.160]  news and you see Alex Jones's face and then it says KKK leader and this is Alex
[39:20.160 --> 39:24.040]  Jones promulgates something that's coming up it's just all done to mix it
[39:24.040 --> 39:28.800]  together and to deceive people in a massive way now I've got to be honest
[39:28.800 --> 39:33.160]  with the viewers and listeners I've kind of gotten punched drunk to this I am so
[39:33.160 --> 39:37.560]  accustomed to just mega-level deception by the fake news media who dubs us fake
[39:37.560 --> 39:41.920]  media total inversion of reality that I've just got a lot of attention to it
[39:41.920 --> 39:46.400]  very often when I say hundreds of articles of that attacking me by name
[39:46.400 --> 39:51.440]  it's hundreds now 30 years ago that would destroy somebody but it only
[39:51.440 --> 39:56.680]  empowers us and therein lies the delusion of these people all the thinking
[39:56.680 --> 40:01.400]  people every race color creed now understand this media is far and own
[40:01.400 --> 40:06.040]  globalist run out to get us they see the Pope lecturing us and telling us what
[40:06.040 --> 40:09.560]  we should do in the communist Chinese and the Saudi Arabians and everybody else
[40:09.560 --> 40:14.200]  and they see through it but truly the reason they're trying to derail what
[40:14.200 --> 40:19.960]  Trump is doing and calling it racist and demonizing it is because it will end
[40:19.960 --> 40:23.400]  their global system if America is allowed to operate outside of
[40:23.400 --> 40:29.440]  globalism and it's prosperous that American system will out-competed and
[40:29.440 --> 40:32.000]  if you go back to the rubber bears a hundred years ago they all wrote news
[40:32.000 --> 40:37.080]  articles in Europe in England and in the US admitting that they couldn't
[40:37.080 --> 40:40.720]  compete with the American system because it wasn't centralized it wasn't all
[40:40.720 --> 40:45.880]  based on small combines oligopoly and monopoly so Trump's fight is the old
[40:45.880 --> 40:50.120]  fight it's the American fight that's why it's so powerful it's not just some
[40:50.120 --> 40:55.400]  ideology he went and made up somewhere so when the media sits there at reddit or
[40:55.400 --> 41:01.800]  the New York Times and says what is globalism does it exist no it's like
[41:01.800 --> 41:07.360]  telling a child that ABCD EFG doesn't exist it's like saying that George
[41:07.360 --> 41:14.560]  Washington didn't exist but that's the level of deception and just waging war
[41:14.560 --> 41:18.800]  on reality that they're involved in because they are at war with reality
[41:18.800 --> 41:23.000]  because what they're selling authoritarianism as some neoliberal
[41:23.000 --> 41:28.760]  wonderful cosmology is so ridiculous no one wants to buy it freedom and free
[41:28.760 --> 41:34.120]  association is like the greatest gourmet smorgasbord cornucopia selection
[41:34.120 --> 41:38.920]  the world could ever imagine compared to standing in line for two or three days
[41:38.920 --> 41:43.040]  you get a couple sausages and potatoes and again it wasn't the communist
[41:43.040 --> 41:47.120]  systems couldn't produce they didn't want to produce they use the limited
[41:47.120 --> 41:51.920]  production and the artificial scarcity they create to control people and they
[41:51.920 --> 41:57.480]  write text looks on it and that's why globalism so evil it is a worldwide
[41:57.480 --> 42:03.080]  system of austerity and being poor and the people being ignorant and people
[42:03.080 --> 42:10.120]  being played off against each other so the fact that they are upping their game
[42:10.120 --> 42:15.480]  24-7 attacking Stephen Bannon and yours truly Alex Jones tells you something
[42:15.480 --> 42:19.400]  they know Stephen Bannon is a patriot and an anti-globalist and wants to launch a
[42:19.400 --> 42:23.520]  plan to make even the poorest people wealthy in comparison to other nations
[42:23.520 --> 42:27.480]  he's openly said that that is their plan carrier air conditions already coming
[42:27.480 --> 42:30.600]  back for it's already coming back apples as they may come back before he's even
[42:30.600 --> 42:35.120]  in office and they're attacking yours truly because if they can get Trump to
[42:35.120 --> 42:41.520]  cut away from his base it's not just crippling Trump it will cut him off from
[42:41.520 --> 42:46.480]  Americana which they're trying to dub as racist and evil for us to have level
[42:46.480 --> 42:53.160]  playing fields and control borders and basic sovereignty so Trump is purposely
[42:53.160 --> 42:57.960]  invoking nationalism and red meat stuff like don't burn any American flag to
[42:57.960 --> 43:02.960]  force the left to then begin defending free speech something they've actually
[43:02.960 --> 43:08.040]  been attacking something they're coming out in bulldozing they want to yell
[43:08.040 --> 43:10.600]  about free speech burning the flag all day and I agree you have a right to do
[43:10.600 --> 43:15.080]  it you know I don't like it but they're the ones banning stuff off Facebook off
[43:15.080 --> 43:20.040]  Twitter the Apple purges and some people say oh less apples company they can't
[43:20.040 --> 43:23.480]  know they approve your app it goes through the deal then they kick you off
[43:23.480 --> 43:28.280]  three times we had Obama deception paid for by third party companies in coded
[43:28.280 --> 43:33.200]  and loaded and accepted and then they would delete it one day after they
[43:33.200 --> 43:38.200]  always mistake Apple wants the $5,000 again and we've encoded again and put
[43:38.200 --> 43:44.160]  it through I had Google refused to sell in Google store and they shut her store
[43:44.160 --> 43:49.680]  down those article happened a few years ago I guess seven years ago now and it
[43:49.680 --> 43:53.840]  just banned us and said this is a racist film we are not allowing you to sell it
[43:53.840 --> 44:00.160]  or have an Apple or a Google store so this is what they're doing folks this
[44:00.160 --> 44:05.240]  is serious censorship and they're throwing it everybody's face while saying
[44:05.240 --> 44:09.800]  they're quote the liberals they're doing this because they're desperate they're
[44:09.800 --> 44:14.200]  doing this because the ideas that I promote and the Stephen Bannon others
[44:14.200 --> 44:21.800]  promote is poison to these people and will bring their system down so for the
[44:21.800 --> 44:24.680]  new viewers and new listeners this is not my opinion the things we're talking
[44:24.680 --> 44:28.800]  about here are admitted by the enemy by the globalists in their own publications
[44:28.800 --> 44:33.800]  and documents and once we identify the globalist and their global system and
[44:33.800 --> 44:35.960]  get the public to actually go read research what's really happening it's
[44:35.960 --> 44:42.000]  game over for them so some family and others say how am I taking it with these
[44:42.000 --> 44:47.720]  new levels of perception I'm taking it fine it means I'm having an effect means
[44:47.720 --> 44:51.200]  the great crew at Info Wars is having an effect it means the listeners of this
[44:51.200 --> 44:55.320]  radio show and TV show are spreading the word taking action but do not take any
[44:55.320 --> 44:58.920]  of this for granted they are trying to shut us down and they can shut down
[44:58.920 --> 45:03.360]  Breitbart or Drudge or Info Wars if they can get any one of those they set the
[45:03.360 --> 45:07.000]  precedent to take everything else out and they were on the verge they handed
[45:07.000 --> 45:11.560]  over the internet to the UN and a multinational consortium they were about
[45:11.560 --> 45:16.000]  to get five Supreme Court justices at least four that they were imploding
[45:16.000 --> 45:18.680]  everything the borders are already been completely lowered the drones were turned
[45:18.680 --> 45:21.880]  off they were already you know telling us that you know jihadis are gonna be
[45:21.880 --> 45:25.960]  put in every town every city they were there that close to finishing their
[45:25.960 --> 45:34.640]  operation let's just pray Trump's for real because in a modern sense he is our
[45:34.640 --> 45:39.000]  best and only hope for rectifying this in a peaceful manner because let me tell
[45:39.000 --> 45:42.080]  you something the globalists are not gonna be peaceful next phase they're not
[45:42.080 --> 45:45.760]  gonna coexist with us they cannot coexist with the free market open true
[45:45.760 --> 45:51.520]  liberal society Jones posted this video entitled an emergency message to Donald
[45:51.520 --> 45:58.320]  Trump during the campaign I am going to ask you to seriously think about making
[45:58.320 --> 46:03.280]  the issue of Hillary's election fraud in the primaries one of the central issues
[46:03.280 --> 46:09.440]  to defeating her in November Trump had this to say a day later afraid the
[46:09.440 --> 46:14.200]  election is gonna be rigged I have to be honest because I think my side was
[46:14.200 --> 46:19.120]  rigged and in the wake of the election Jones pushing a theory that despite the
[46:19.120 --> 46:23.560]  vote totals Trump actually won the popular vote millions of illegals
[46:23.560 --> 46:28.760]  voting at least five states being stolen for Hillary we're talking five six
[46:28.760 --> 46:33.760]  seven eight million people more voting for Trump if you look at the evidence in
[46:33.760 --> 46:38.960]  the popular vote than did and Trump tweeting just four days later quote in
[46:38.960 --> 46:43.560]  addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide I won the popular
[46:43.560 --> 46:48.600]  vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally I'll tell you
[46:48.600 --> 46:58.280]  it is surreal to talk about issues here on air and then word for word here
[46:58.280 --> 47:02.520]  Trump say it two days later and I'm not just calling ourselves liberal because
[47:02.520 --> 47:06.520]  that takes it away from them liberalism if you studied it 200 years ago is
[47:06.520 --> 47:12.560]  antithetical to modern liberalism it is the complete 180 opposite liberalism
[47:12.560 --> 47:15.360]  means do what you want as long as you heard somebody else but I can live the
[47:15.360 --> 47:20.760]  way I want don't come force me to live the way you say I should look at all
[47:20.760 --> 47:24.600]  this garbage liberalism means lower taxes private property rights religious
[47:24.600 --> 47:28.560]  freedoms or freedom not ever legit see it's the opposite everything they're
[47:28.560 --> 47:32.600]  pushing is how Jim's on TV with the news anchors but you can't work across it's
[47:32.600 --> 47:36.840]  all about impacting and getting us in line to just accept incredible
[47:36.840 --> 47:40.920]  outrageous and that's why the Republic of the Democratic Establishments are
[47:40.920 --> 47:45.280]  panicking and freaking out but I've got to say seeing in discredits itself with
[47:45.280 --> 47:50.560]  crap like this and it really really shows how their entire system is based
[47:50.560 --> 47:55.680]  around race baiting and it really is a despicable despicable news organization
[47:55.680 --> 48:01.440]  and quite frankly I don't even give them interviews when they ask for it for
[48:01.440 --> 48:04.960]  interview request because they always just talk to me for like five minutes
[48:04.960 --> 48:08.440]  use a short clip to act like they were journalists and act like they got my
[48:08.440 --> 48:12.280]  response but they don't even call now to try to get a response whenever they
[48:12.280 --> 48:16.320]  take what we say out of context or twist things because these are not
[48:16.320 --> 48:20.360]  journalists folks they know they're paid mercenaries they know they're paid hacks
[48:20.360 --> 48:23.720]  and they know good damn well they're trying to basically undermine this
[48:23.720 --> 48:27.800]  country they've conquered us that's why they're so arrogant and people have to
[48:27.800 --> 48:32.200]  understand that if you're under their mind control under their spell come out
[48:32.200 --> 48:36.720]  of it folks they are predators they are bad news they did back the year of
[48:36.720 --> 48:42.520]  spring they did back starting wars with Russia these are very bad people and
[48:42.520 --> 48:47.000]  we've got to bring nationalism back in a big way folks it's how we can organize
[48:47.000 --> 48:50.640]  against globalism because at least a nation has a chance for the people to
[48:50.640 --> 48:55.240]  run it and to fix it under globalism its worldwide system you can't get out of
[48:55.240 --> 48:59.960]  it unless nations begin to pull out of it and that's happening so a modern war
[48:59.960 --> 49:03.640]  is taking place right now of the nation state and individuals and self
[49:03.640 --> 49:10.720]  determination against the modern royalty the true definition of globalism is
[49:10.720 --> 49:19.480]  third wave corporate colonialism establishing a planetary above the law
[49:19.480 --> 49:25.560]  corporate dictatorship I mean that's what it is and so no one should want to
[49:25.560 --> 49:29.400]  live under that and there's no arguments you can push for that but now
[49:29.400 --> 49:34.160]  their their new argument is we're going to quote be liberal world government
[49:34.160 --> 49:37.920]  actually say that the economists and we're gonna enforce racial equity
[49:37.920 --> 49:41.400]  worldwide that is playing people off against each other and using third world
[49:41.400 --> 49:46.080]  populations against the West I mean this is dastardly this is dirty and this
[49:46.080 --> 49:49.560]  is how the corporations play who are exploiting everybody we've got to be
[49:49.560 --> 49:54.000]  smart enough to come together turn on the real Renaissance basically terraform
[49:54.000 --> 50:01.280]  the planet for clean renewable technocracy for the people to actually
[50:01.280 --> 50:05.400]  decentralized power instead of a technocracy that's based on total
[50:05.400 --> 50:09.120]  surveillance and dehumanization we've got to have a purpose-based economy
[50:09.120 --> 50:13.360]  purpose-based world we've got a lot space colonies undersea colonies we've
[50:13.360 --> 50:17.360]  got a trailblaze and make our heroes again people are very cutting edge and
[50:17.360 --> 50:24.480]  celebrate our humanity and not give it up like the eugenicists based technocrats
[50:24.480 --> 50:28.400]  are now pushing I'm Alex Jones signing off for info wars.com and they go
[50:28.400 --> 50:31.560]  ahead and end the baton back to David Knight in the full broadcast he's
[50:31.560 --> 50:35.480]  outlined it today and I'll be back later with a special report Turkey has declared
[50:35.480 --> 50:39.480]  war on Syria does this mean that World War 3 is about to erupt that's info
[50:39.480 --> 50:43.840]  wars.com and even a London Telegraph says that most experts agree this could
[50:43.840 --> 50:50.400]  trigger the next third world war because when Turkey declares war against Syria
[50:50.400 --> 50:55.200]  Syria is allied with Russia and that means a NATO nation has now declared
[50:55.200 --> 51:01.360]  war on Russia that's what this really means stay with us will the government

[55:13.280 --> 55:16.880]  appreciate your support that is why it has helped us have such a big impact
[55:16.880 --> 55:22.440]  that they are doing regular hit pieces on CNN just as they're trying to ban us
[55:22.440 --> 55:26.600]  and shut us down trying to shut us down through the news aggregators that
[55:26.600 --> 55:31.280]  they're creating with Apple's operating system as well as taking Breitbart out
[55:31.280 --> 55:35.560]  of the app store so this is the kind of pushback that they're doing as Alex
[55:35.560 --> 55:40.520]  pointed out in that last piece it's absolutely amazing to see the dishonest
[55:40.520 --> 55:45.640]  fake news of CNN putting his picture up there then putting a lower thirds
[55:45.640 --> 55:50.200]  underneath it former Ku Klux Klan leader and not saying coming up or
[55:50.200 --> 55:54.320]  anything just former Ku Klux Klan leader and then underneath that Alex Jones
[55:54.320 --> 55:59.880]  and infowars.com I mean how incredibly dishonest that is but that's the kind of
[55:59.880 --> 56:05.240]  below-the-belt attacks that they do we're gonna talk about the real voter fraud
[56:05.240 --> 56:09.360]  coming up in the next hour we're gonna have Owen Shroyer and Darren McBrain
[56:09.360 --> 56:13.960]  joining me and we've got another report from Alex Jones coming up but let's take
[56:13.960 --> 56:18.320]  a look at what Mnuchin who has been the campaign finance manager for Donald
[56:18.320 --> 56:23.680]  Trump since May and he was announced as Trump's pick for Treasury Secretary let's
[56:23.680 --> 56:29.120]  take a look at what he said in terms of his vision for the economy. How much
[56:29.120 --> 56:33.120]  money is sitting overseas right now we're talking about two trillion dollars
[56:33.120 --> 56:37.400]  or something? It's a staggering number. First of all the reason why American
[56:37.400 --> 56:41.840]  companies don't bring the cash back is because the differential in tax rates
[56:41.840 --> 56:46.160]  so the combination of lowering the corporate tax and a one-time 10%
[56:46.160 --> 56:50.120]  repatriation tax absolutely going to get cash back here I mean if you look at
[56:50.120 --> 56:53.560]  Apple Apple is kind of the classic company they're sitting on hundreds of
[56:53.560 --> 56:56.720]  billions of dollars of cash and they go out and borrow money against the
[56:56.720 --> 57:00.520]  overseas bank accounts this this makes no sense and they said the reason why
[57:00.520 --> 57:03.560]  they're doing that is because of that high corporate tax rate so we think
[57:03.560 --> 57:07.360]  there's going to be hundreds of billions if not trillions of dollars that's
[57:07.360 --> 57:10.400]  going to come back and that that's going to create infrastructure and create
[57:10.400 --> 57:13.760]  jobs. Well it makes no sense on one level but it makes a lot of sense on
[57:13.760 --> 57:18.280]  another level because you've got zero percent interest rates. Right but you
[57:18.280 --> 57:23.440]  already have Apple talking about now being factories back. I love it. Did you hear that
[57:23.440 --> 57:28.320]  last year or the year before? No. Yeah. Now you're hearing it. Exactly. Okay and that was
[57:28.320 --> 57:31.480]  also the other person you heard talking there was Ross who is a pick for a
[57:31.480 --> 57:36.800]  commerce secretary. Yeah we want to get companies to base themselves back in
[57:36.800 --> 57:41.040]  United States again. Is that a bad idea? How about stopping them from moving to
[57:41.040 --> 57:43.800]  another country in the first place and of course that's something that Donald
[57:43.800 --> 57:47.160]  Trump has been working on very hard. He was working on it on Thanksgiving they
[57:47.160 --> 57:50.320]  announced a carrier deal as I pointed out before we don't know what it is but it
[57:50.320 --> 57:56.320]  is an effort by someone who's not even become president yet and already he's
[57:56.320 --> 57:59.440]  keeping jobs in the United States. Mnuchin said the carrier deal I think is
[57:59.440 --> 58:02.560]  terrific. He said the president-elect and the vice president picked up the phone
[58:02.560 --> 58:06.360]  called the CEO of United Technologies told them that we want to keep jobs here
[58:06.360 --> 58:11.560]  and this is it. He said I can't remember the last time a president did that. This
[58:11.560 --> 58:16.400]  is going to be a terrific opportunity. That's why we're so hopeful. Donald Trump
[58:16.400 --> 58:20.040]  is working very hard and we're going to talk in the next hour as well about the
[58:20.040 --> 58:25.360]  announcements that he is going to diverge himself from these business issues.
[58:25.360 --> 58:29.640]  Why? Because his first priority is being president. We've already seen that with
[58:29.640 --> 58:32.840]  the settlement that he made on that lawsuit. We're talking more about that in
[58:32.840 --> 58:38.560]  the next hour with Owen Shora and Darren McBrain. Stay with us. We'll be right back.

[59:49.760 --> 01:00:16.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:32.480]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:39.760]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:39.760 --> 01:01:01.760]  10 year old Somali refugee Abdul Razak Ali Artan who obtained a green card to enter the United States in 2014 injured 11 students on the Ohio State University campus yesterday first striking them with a car and then exiting the car to attack the students with a butcher knife.
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:30.760]  World Net Daily reports campus police chief Craig Stone said our officer was on the scene in less than a minute and he ended the situation in less than a minute. He engaged the suspect and he eliminated the threat. The suspect is DOA. Artan had been quoted in the campus newspaper, The Lantern, several months ago, complaining about the school's lack of Islamic prayer rooms. He blamed the negative view Americans have of Muslims on
[01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:46.760]  Islamophobia planted in their minds by the US media, not by the numerous terror attacks or sexual assaults. And the delusional blame game continues to mushroom. Tariq Nasheed, an extreme left documentary filmmaker bemoaned.
[01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:57.760]  So white officer Alan Heruko, who shot and killed the black Somali stabbing suspect in Ohio is being paraded as a hero. That's interesting.
[01:01:57.760 --> 01:02:09.760]  Anti-Second Amendment Senator Tim Kaine tweeted deeply saddened by the senseless act of gun violence at Ohio State this morning, praying for the injured in the entire Buckeye community.
[01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:24.760]  Of course, no gun was used. Paul Joseph Watson pointed out that a woman named Kay tweeted, Poor kid goes through hell as a child in Somalia, comes to America, probably been bullied by racists in White Ohio, now he's dead.
[01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:39.760]  Thanks, Trump. And even the New World Order chimed in as Anna De Rothschild tweeted, Thoughts and prayers are with the victims in Ohio. America must wake up and abolish your Second Amendment. It is 100% the problem.
[01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:51.760]  Trump is blind. Meanwhile, back here in reality that exists 24-7 outside of the Twitter universe, people in Columbus, Ohio now have more reason to be looking over their shoulder.
[01:02:51.760 --> 01:03:06.760]  As recent as February of 2016, Mohammed Barry, a Muslim immigrant from Guinea, charged into the Nazareth Restaurant in Delhi in Columbus, Ohio and attacked the patrons with a machete in what was described as a bloodbath. Barry was shot dead.
[01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:25.760]  CNS News.com reports 98,799 Somali refugees have settled in the United States since 9-11. More than 99% of those refugees are Muslim, reflecting the religious makeup of Somalia's population, which is almost entirely Muslim, predominantly Sunni.
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:39.760]  The largest number of Somali refugees arriving in the country since 9-11 have been settled in Minnesota, almost 16,000, Ohio, more than 7,500, and sizable communities also in Texas, New York and Arizona.
[01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:54.760]  America chose Trump for a reason. Paul Joseph Watson writes, just three weeks ago, Trump cautioned that Somali migrants in states such as Minnesota were refusing to integrate and that a portion of them posed a terror threat.
[01:03:54.760 --> 01:04:01.760]  Some of them are joining ISIS and spreading their extremist views all over our country and all over the world, said Trump.
[01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:09.760]  Of course, no one wants to call it a terror attack, but Barry and Artan were just following orders from terrorists.
[01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:28.760]  Business Insider reports Michael Smith, the founder of Security from Cronus Advisory, who has advised Congress on terror-related issues, pointed out on Twitter that an ISIS video released days before the OSU attack showed a French ISIS member demonstrating how to kill people using knives.
[01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:38.760]  This member also called for attacks in the West, and in the past two months, English-language ISIS propaganda magazines have called for vehicle and knife attacks.
[01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:51.760]  Sorry, Anna Doroth Child and Senator Tim Kaine, thanks to people like you and your globalist policies. This is precisely why Americans need their Second Amendment rights.
[01:04:51.760 --> 01:05:00.760]  It's not bound for info wars dot com.
[01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:08.760]  A gun scare at a swanky hotel in New York City last night resulted in police swarming the lobby and taking four people into custody.
[01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:19.760]  Now, I'm talking, of course, about the Gramercy Park Hotel, a report coming out of a CBS local affiliate in New York says the guest at the five-star hotel were greeted with storms of police last night over, quote,
[01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:25.760]  concerns for people ultimately taken into custody over a Facebook Live video that they were conducting in the hotel room.
[01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:29.760]  Now, these guests and the lobby were obviously greeted with massive police.
[01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:35.760]  They were rightfully confused, and one of them said she was, quote, shocked by the incident wanting to just leave the lobby as soon as possible.
[01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:40.760]  Police arriving around 4.15 with a report of a threat because of the Facebook Live post.
[01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:44.760]  Now, this is what one police spokesperson told Patch News around 7pm, quote,
[01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:54.760]  a bunch of people were arrested for having BB guns at the location. Yes, they were live streaming with BB guns and drug paraphernalia in the room, creating an all-out terror threat alert.
[01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:59.760]  This is what it's come to, folks. I'm Margaret Howell reporting for info wars dot com.

[01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:32.760]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight here with Owen Shorer and Darren McBreen, a couple of our other reporters.
[01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:44.760]  I'm going to be talking about the attack piece on Alex Jones by CNN and this narrative of fake news. But of course, we just heard that report from John Bowne at the top of the hour.
[01:08:44.760 --> 01:09:02.760]  Talking about how the left is trying to defend this guy who attacked people in OSU. And of course, I've got an article here from Politico solidly in the Hillary Clinton left camp solidly attacking Donald Trump saying, Trump tweets that the alleged OSU attacker should not have been in our country.
[01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:07.760]  They think this is a winning issue. That's how out of touch they are with the electorate.
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:20.760]  And of course, Trump said on Wednesday morning that the OSU student who allegedly wounded. Okay, I don't know that we need the allegedly there. Several people during a stabbing attack was quote, a refugee who should not have been in our country.
[01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:29.760]  You know, were these people, was he vetted? When I saw these reports, guys, they didn't even know what his age was, plus or minus five years.
[01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:42.760]  They don't know anything about this guy. And yet he is a legal permanent resident. This is what Donald Trump said from the very beginning. They tried to push this thing by saying, well, you know, he wanted to ban all Muslims know what he was saying was we need to stop all immigration
[01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:54.760]  from certain countries until we can vet the people who are coming in so we don't have this exact thing. He was proven right. And now they continue to try to attack him saying, look, he's attacking Muslims as those Muslims who are attacking us.
[01:09:54.760 --> 01:10:05.760]  By the way, Jimmy Carter did the same thing in his administration in the 70s. Yeah. Right. And that was to stop any, any people from Iran coming in and they were seriously vetted.
[01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:11.760]  And a lot of them were not allowed into the country because of the whole Iran crisis and the whole hostage crisis.
[01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:18.760]  So they, you know, they always try to point make this a kind of a Republican type of thing, but the Democrats did the same thing in the 70s.
[01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:29.760]  That's right. Well, how are you supposed to properly vet people that come from a country that doesn't have any infrastructure? How are you supposed to find out somebody's age who doesn't even know it themselves?
[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:39.760]  Yeah. So we know that this is going on. And this is something that, you know, refugee programs have to deal with. I mean, this is a humanitarian effort to take care of these people.
[01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:48.760]  But the problem is, ISIS knows this. So what they do is they infiltrate these refugee groups. They say, oh, I don't know my age.
[01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:52.760]  You know, I don't know where I came from. I, you know, I'm from a country with no infrastructure.
[01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:58.760]  And of course, the problem is we created ISIS and we created the regime overthrow that created the refugees. We created that.
[01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:07.760]  So when you look at the Aleppo boy and your heart goes out to him as it should, understand that it was Hillary Clinton who set the Middle East on fire, who created this situation
[01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:16.760]  and who tried to do everything they can to prevent the Assad regime or the Russians are working with them to try to stop this and get back to a peaceful situation.
[01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:19.760]  Hold on a minute, David. CNN says that's a conspiracy. That's right. I heard it last night.
[01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:27.760]  It is a conspiracy, but it's not a theory. OK, let's talk about the fake news of CNN. We've got a Trump economist, Steve Moore, who takes him on.
[01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:30.760]  I want to play this clip and get your comments on this.
[01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:35.760]  And when I say fake news, I mean stories that are designed to trick people into believing lies.
[01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:39.760]  Let's be clear. Donald Trump will lose the election. Right now, Donald Trump will lose the election.
[01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:42.760]  I mean, if you look at the battleground states right now, Donald Trump's going to lose.
[01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:47.760]  This is different what Donald Trump's doing. It's sinister. It reeks of Joe McCarthy.
[01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:54.760]  Texas is still competitive. Is the election over? I mean, a lot of political scientists would say at this point, nothing matters.
[01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:57.760]  They said, if Trump's elected, the market will go down three to five percent.
[01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:01.760]  If Donald Trump wins the election, the stock market will take me and I would hurt the stock market.
[01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:07.760]  Trump were to win, you know, the stock market would go down. You know, one of the pillars of the infamous blue wall.
[01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:10.760]  Think about if she can hold there. That's a key part of that blue wall.
[01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:12.760]  Trump clearly going after that blue wall.
[01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:17.760]  It's whether Hillary Clinton's going to win by small margin or whether we're going to essentially annihilate Donald Trump.
[01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:18.760]  I think Hillary will win.
[01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:21.760]  And most analysts are saying that Hillary Clinton's going to win in a landslide.
[01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:23.760]  I don't think it's likely that Hillary Clinton will win.
[01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:28.760]  Thirty to forty percent of people, roughly speaking, are going to have voted for Trump.
[01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:34.760]  And if Donald Trump does lose, particularly if he loses, in the face of a massive turnout from Latino communities.
[01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:37.760]  But there's an invisible surge with Latinos.
[01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:40.760]  The surge of the Latino vote, that that's going to be enough.
[01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:46.760]  The surge in Hispanic-Latino voting, this is the number right here we're all going to be talking about after the election.
[01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:47.760]  It is the Hispanic vote.
[01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:49.760]  But the surge of Latino voters.
[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:55.760]  African-American voters and Hispanic voters and college-educated white women especially are coming out in droves.
[01:12:55.760 --> 01:12:58.760]  He claims that the media is lying and that it's reporting cannot be believed.
[01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:00.760]  So Donald Trump will lose.
[01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:03.760]  They're the most basic, pure form of fake news.
[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:06.760]  Yeah, the most purest form of fake news.
[01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:09.760]  You just saw the clips from the mainstream media themselves.
[01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:10.760]  And everybody has seen that.
[01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:14.760]  Just a reminder and that real tight clip of what they've been lying to you about.
[01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:16.760]  And so they're trying to get that back.
[01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:20.760]  And of course they can't let go, guys, of this notion that Donald Trump actually won.
[01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:27.760]  I mean, they were trying to drag them into reality kicking and screaming, but they keep screaming and kicking even louder.
[01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:30.760]  Trying to say, we're going to pull this back, oh, the electoral college has got to go, this and that.
[01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:32.760]  We're going to have a revolt of electors.
[01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:33.760]  None of that's going to happen.
[01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:38.760]  And yet this piece that they did last night when we said, yeah, there really is election fraud.
[01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:39.760]  There really is voter fraud.
[01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:40.760]  Everybody knows that.
[01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:41.760]  Yeah, we know that.
[01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:47.760]  And so you want to create this false illusion that Hillary Clinton, and it's amazing to watch this after the election.
[01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:50.760]  These people continue to persist, but I keep watching her vote total grow.
[01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:55.760]  You know, well, she's going to win by a million votes, no, by a million and a half, two million, two and a half.
[01:13:55.760 --> 01:14:00.760]  And then the last one I saw, I think it was on Daily News, they said, well, currently she's leading by two and a half million.
[01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:06.760]  It's like, well, folks, the real election ended about three weeks ago, but you keep pushing this and you keep padding it.
[01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:14.760]  And that's precisely why we need the electoral colleges as a firewall against the corruption where in places like New York, they can continue to pad the vote.
[01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:16.760]  Well, the onion ought to write a story.
[01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:19.760]  Clinton wins by a hundred million votes because, you know, that's what they'll do next.
[01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:21.760]  They'll just have a hundred million people show up to vote.
[01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:22.760]  But this is amazing.
[01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:27.760]  This is the second time that the Clinton campaign is going to try to have their cake and eat it too.
[01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:31.760]  Let's remember they said that there's no such thing as rigged elections.
[01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:32.760]  Don't worry about voter fraud.
[01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:33.760]  We've got it under control.
[01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:38.760]  But meanwhile, out of the other side of their mouth, they're saying that Russia is hacking the elections.
[01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:39.760]  We need to be aware of Russia.
[01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:40.760]  So what is it?
[01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:43.760]  We've got people, you know, overlooking the elections to make sure they're happening.
[01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:45.760]  So they tried to have their cake and eat it too there.
[01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:47.760]  Now they're trying to do it again.
[01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:54.760]  They're demonizing Donald Trump for talking about illegal voting or voter fraud while they're recounting the election.
[01:14:54.760 --> 01:15:01.760]  And of course, he said that it was absolutely it was going to destroy the fabric of American democracy to question the results of the election.
[01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:02.760]  Yeah, the peaceful.
[01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:05.760]  It's a tradition to overchange power peacefully.
[01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:06.760]  That's right.
[01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:08.760]  Well, CNN, they're digging their own grave.
[01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:09.760]  All right.
[01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:11.760]  They've lost all touch with the American people.
[01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:15.760]  I mean, they're basically tabloid journalism.
[01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:19.760]  And the more these hit pieces come out, I think thanks for the plug.
[01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:21.760]  I mean, a lot of people, they had it.
[01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:23.760]  I'll give them this much good for the first time.
[01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:27.760]  At least I saw Alex Jones pictures of Alex look good.
[01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:35.760]  You know, usually they'll show him from like 2006 in our old studio to kind of give us a, you know, not not such a credibility look.
[01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:43.760]  And at least for like Bill O'Reilly did on Fox News, just showing all red-faced streaming about something that has anything to do with what he's talking about there.
[01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:46.760]  Just take a little short little clip there to try to make him look bad.
[01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:51.760]  Let's go to an interview that Alex had after the election with Bev Harris.
[01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:53.760]  This is somebody who follows election fraud.
[01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:54.760]  She's a Democrat.
[01:15:54.760 --> 01:16:00.760]  We've had her on every election to talk about the real issues that we need to be concerned about.
[01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:10.760]  And this is something we, what we should not let go of is our things that we could do to improve the honest and true election that we have.
[01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:20.760]  And there's a lot of systemic fraud that is built into this from not having people's voter IDs to allowing electronic voting machines where you deliberately shut down the auditing capability.
[01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:22.760]  Those things need to be looked at by everybody.
[01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:24.760]  Left and right needs to come back and look at that.
[01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:26.760]  But that's not how they're using this.
[01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:37.760]  And so I want to play and get your reactions to this Bev Harris report where she's talking about how they tried to steal the election from Trump, but they failed.
[01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:39.760]  Bev Harris has a lot of integrity.
[01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:42.760]  She's been a Democrat, a liberal, she's opposed what Bush did.
[01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:46.760]  And I was bipartisan, but there was more evidence of Republican fraud than Democrat.
[01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:47.760]  Both parties do it.
[01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:50.760]  And she said last week what Assange said, they're not going to let Trump have it, the fix is in.
[01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:52.760]  I'm no rocket scientist, but I've said this.
[01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:57.760]  It's all places where she won by such margins, even their fake polls didn't say that.
[01:16:57.760 --> 01:16:59.760]  But they weren't in full control.
[01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:00.760]  You can't stop the landslide.
[01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:02.760]  I don't know Bev Harris's view on this yet.
[01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:04.760]  I want to find out, but I respect it.
[01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:07.760]  She is the expert globally.
[01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:08.760]  I'm not bragging.
[01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:09.760]  It's just a fact for us.
[01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:11.760]  People need to know how accomplishing on target she is.
[01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:15.760]  She's had more exposure of election fraud than everybody else combined.
[01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:17.760]  And that's not poo pooing all those great folks.
[01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:18.760]  She is so effective.
[01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:20.760]  And when she was on a week and a half ago, it made national news.
[01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:23.760]  She released the information here on the fraction magic.
[01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:26.760]  These programs they found around the country that have no reason to be there but for fraud
[01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:30.760]  to pre-program what's going to happen at the central system.
[01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:31.760]  And of course Soros is involved.
[01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:32.760]  And she just said it.
[01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:34.760]  You know, most of the evidence is the Democrats and Soros.
[01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:36.760]  It looks like they're trying to do this.
[01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:40.760]  Well, just a lay looking at this, being up all night covering it.
[01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:45.760]  Having the polls for each state in front of me, it looks like they weren't in control of some areas.
[01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:47.760]  And that's why Trump won because of the landslide.
[01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:49.760]  But it should have been an even bigger victory.
[01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:56.760]  And so it looks like that, again, Bev Harris has always said on the show for 15 years,
[01:17:56.760 --> 01:17:58.760]  you can't steal a landslide.
[01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:01.760]  Now, I'm going to find out if I'm wrong or I'm right here from her.
[01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:03.760]  But of course, we're pretty close to this right now.
[01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:06.760]  We'll know more as it unfolds.
[01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:11.760]  But Bev Harris, I mean, is that a basically accurate what I said or is it wrong?
[01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:12.760]  Yeah, basically accurate.
[01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:14.760]  It did pretty good, Alex.
[01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:19.760]  You know, as I was watching you today, a few things, the observations.
[01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:25.760]  One thing struck me very early in the morning yesterday is they had been planning fireworks.
[01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:29.760]  And then they said the Clinton campaign suddenly canceled their fireworks.
[01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:35.760]  They did this early in the morning, which makes me curious as to whether, you know,
[01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:41.760]  their intel, they already knew they were in trouble at that point because it didn't make sense otherwise.
[01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:48.760]  Another thing that struck me though, I have seen, particularly with the Democrats,
[01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:57.760]  a tactic where they'll take a concentrated blue area and hold back the results for hours and hours and hours.
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:19:03.760]  That's, for example, when Hillary ran against Obama in the primary in Indiana.
[01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:05.760]  Yeah, let's hold that right there because we're coming up to a break.
[01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:10.760]  And what you just said about them holding the vote, that is something I've seen over and over again.
[01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:11.760]  Show us your card.
[01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:13.760]  You know, you plan a game of poker, right?
[01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:16.760]  And then it's always the urban areas that are under control of the Democrats.
[01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:19.760]  Just like we saw in North Carolina where there's a very close gubernatorial race there,
[01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:21.760]  where they tried to pull it out for Hillary Clinton.
[01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:26.760]  They let the most heavily controlled Democrat area go for another hour and a half.
[01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:30.760]  And then they came in with 100,000 votes for the Democrat candidate there.
[01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:32.760]  That's what we've seen over and over again.
[01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:35.760]  But this is the first time I've seen them holding back their votes
[01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:39.760]  and continuing to pump these things in for like three weeks after the election.
[01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:40.760]  I mean, it's absolutely insane.
[01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:43.760]  We're going to be right back with Owen Shorter and Darren McBrain.
[01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:48.760]  And we're going to talk more about how their other people, besides just Bev Harris,
[01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:51.760]  pointing out how this thing is going to be audited.
[01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:55.760]  And we're going to show you exactly how they rigged this election.
[01:19:55.760 --> 01:20:20.760]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:51.760]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:58.760]  We'll be right back.
[01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:28.760]  We'll be right back.
[01:21:51.760 --> 01:21:58.760]  We'll be right back.
[01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:28.760]  We'll be right back.
[01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:58.760]  We'll be right back.
[01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:28.760]  We'll be right back.
[01:23:51.760 --> 01:24:11.760]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:14.760]  I'm David Knight with Owen Shorter and Darren McBrain.
[01:24:14.760 --> 01:24:16.760]  And Darren is going to be with us to the bottom of the hour.
[01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:23.760]  At the bottom of the hour, Alex is going to be joining us with a report about provocative actions from Turkey and NATO.
[01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:25.760]  Still trying to provoke war with Russia.
[01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:27.760]  And of course, that's something we should be very concerned about.
[01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:29.760]  I've had a number of discussions.
[01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:33.760]  I've had an interview with a Russian news source.
[01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:38.760]  It's amazing how optimistic they are because they've seen a loaded gun to their head,
[01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:40.760]  which they're still pointing at their head at this moment.
[01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:44.760]  But they've seen that they felt a great sense of relief with Trump's election.
[01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:46.760]  So hopefully this is not something that's going to continue.
[01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:47.760]  We're going to get to that CNN report.
[01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:49.760]  I want to get your comments on this, Darren.
[01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:53.760]  Real quickly, though, before we go back to the news, we have, for the last day today,
[01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:58.760]  extended the specials that began on Black Friday and continued on through Cyber Monday.
[01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:01.760]  30% off survival shield X2 nascent iodine.
[01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:04.760]  That was our very first product, folks, because it is so important.
[01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:11.760]  It's very important nutrient to have to increase your health to help your functioning of your brain.
[01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:15.760]  Also, supermal vitality, 30% off part of our Cyber Monday pre-special.
[01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:17.760]  Again, these are going to end today.
[01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:18.760]  This is the last day.
[01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:23.760]  Then 30 to 40% off of Infowars Select Storeable Food and InfowarsStore.com.
[01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:29.760]  And finally, the biggest discount of all of them, 50% off Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver.
[01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:30.760]  That's at InfowarsLife.com.
[01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:32.760]  This is the last day for these specials.
[01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:34.760]  So take a look at these specials.
[01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:38.760]  Massive discounts, 30% to 40%, 50% off.
[01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:45.760]  Big discounts across the board on these basic items that you need for your preparedness and for your family's health.
[01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:50.760]  Darren, talk about what you think is the overall strategy of CNN.
[01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:53.760]  We were talking about that during the break, but just tell the audience where you see this.
[01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:54.760]  The overall strategy.
[01:25:54.760 --> 01:25:56.760]  I think it's a chilling effect.
[01:25:56.760 --> 01:25:59.760]  They are trying to send a warning to Donald Trump.
[01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:00.760]  Stop.
[01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:02.760]  Don't refer to Infowars.
[01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:06.760]  And also, this is a message that they're continuing.
[01:26:06.760 --> 01:26:10.760]  It's the bullet point, the talking point about fake news.
[01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:13.760]  In fact, in the hit piece, they mentioned fake news.
[01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:22.760]  And they said that basically implying that Trump gets his intelligence reports from conspiracy theory websites.
[01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:24.760]  So I think it's a chilling effect.
[01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:27.760]  It's going to backfire just like it always does and always has.
[01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:29.760]  Yeah, they're putting out that narrative as you point out.
[01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:32.760]  Well, Pence is in all these meetings and he's getting all the intel briefings,
[01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:34.760]  but Trump's just hanging out on Twitter.
[01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:35.760]  That's not true.
[01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:38.760]  He's hanging out today and said, I've never seen anybody so engaged,
[01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:44.760]  instantly grasping what's going on and asking very deep questions about what's going on.
[01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:50.760]  He catches what these guys are saying and he asked them very pointed questions about what this had.
[01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:53.760]  And he's smart not to trust all the intelligence reports.
[01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:55.760]  He doesn't necessarily trust the CIA.
[01:26:55.760 --> 01:26:56.760]  That's right.
[01:26:56.760 --> 01:27:04.760]  And remember, it was Harry Reid who said, he's the one that suggested that they give Trump faulty intelligence reports.
[01:27:04.760 --> 01:27:06.760]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:08.760]  So why is he complaining about it?
[01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:11.760]  He's like, he can't trust the intelligence reports.
[01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:12.760]  So I mean, come on.
[01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:17.760]  Yeah, it's going to be interesting because we have a clip they're going to play later in the show,
[01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:22.760]  probably when Roger Stone joins us to talk about Trump's picks because he's had a lot of picks.
[01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:26.760]  And of course, pushing back against that, Chuck E. Schumer and Harry Reid had a press conference
[01:27:26.760 --> 01:27:28.760]  and they were saying, well, we're going to have something to say about this.
[01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:30.760]  He's not going to get these confirmed.
[01:27:30.760 --> 01:27:37.760]  Well, it was Harry Reid himself who got rid of the rule of having 60 or 67 senators had to confirm these picks.
[01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:39.760]  He said, no, we're going to do it just a simple majority of 51.
[01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:41.760]  And so I was like, okay, you made that rule.
[01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:43.760]  You're going to die by that rule.
[01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:45.760]  You're not going to be able to stop any of Trump's picks.
[01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:49.760]  So it's interesting to see how this thing is shaking out.
[01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:52.760]  Well, I don't know what CNN's overall agenda here was.
[01:27:52.760 --> 01:28:01.760]  I think that just I checked the Alex Jones channel on YouTube and just a few hours after CNN ran their hit piece or promotional plug.
[01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:06.760]  Honestly, for Alex Jones, if you want to call it that, probably benefited us more than it hurt us.
[01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:09.760]  We picked up a couple of thousand subscribers on the Alex Jones channel.
[01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:14.760]  I've been checked it this morning, but I think we're going to reach 1.9 million soon.
[01:28:14.760 --> 01:28:21.760]  And then maybe with the help of CNN, if they want to continue to hit, hit piece, Alex Jones, maybe we'll reach 2 million by the end of the year.
[01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:27.760]  So I encourage CNN to embark on this journey to try to take down or discredit Alex Jones.
[01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:36.760]  I encourage CNN and all of its talking heads to try to attack Alex Jones or try to separate Alex and Donald or try to have a chilling effect on Donald Trump.
[01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:43.760]  Donald Trump not to associate himself with media outlets that aren't Fox CNN or television approved news.
[01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:51.760]  You know, it's interesting that we had that report that was recording a radio interview with Donald Trump on 9-11 or the day after.
[01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:52.760]  The guy was asking about it.
[01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:56.760]  He goes, look, I'm a builder. I know that you're not going to knock down that building, especially.
[01:28:56.760 --> 01:28:59.760]  It was they bombed the foundation as the strongest part of the building.
[01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:00.760]  You're not going to knock it down on planes.
[01:29:00.760 --> 01:29:02.760]  Well, they had to have bombs or something like that.
[01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:05.760]  You know, from day one, something was up with that.
[01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:10.760]  Okay, so that's one of the reasons why he's looking for other answers to what's going on here.
[01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:12.760]  You're not going to fool him with that.
[01:29:12.760 --> 01:29:13.760]  You're not going to gaslight him.
[01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:15.760]  You're not going to scare him away from this.
[01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:16.760]  He's going to look at this stuff.
[01:29:16.760 --> 01:29:19.760]  And I think he's honest enough when he disagrees with somebody to say it.
[01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:22.760]  And he knew from the very beginning that it was a bunch of nonsense.
[01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:23.760]  He's not afraid to speak out.
[01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:25.760]  And this reminds me a little bit.
[01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:28.760]  They're trying to do the same thing with the whole Bertha controversy.
[01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:32.760]  Okay, they're saying that info or started the Bertha controversy.
[01:29:32.760 --> 01:29:36.760]  No, Sheriff Joe Arpaio had a team of investigators.
[01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:37.760]  Check it out.
[01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:38.760]  It was a long, thorough investigation.
[01:29:38.760 --> 01:29:40.760]  And it was actually Hillary who started it.
[01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:42.760]  And then Hillary talked about it.
[01:29:42.760 --> 01:29:44.760]  But there was a national press conference.
[01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:45.760]  We sent reporters there.
[01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:46.760]  We covered it.
[01:29:46.760 --> 01:29:47.760]  That's how it started.
[01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:48.760]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:48.760 --> 01:29:51.760]  Alex Jones is going to be talking about what's going on with Turkey and NATO.
[01:29:51.760 --> 01:29:52.760]  Fires on the run.
[01:29:52.760 --> 01:29:56.760]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:04.760]  There's currently a war going on in this country and it's waged against Breitbart, Info Wars,
[01:30:04.760 --> 01:30:07.760]  and Drudge in large part because of Trump's victory.
[01:30:07.760 --> 01:30:12.760]  Now, the latest example of this, Apple is purging Breitbart News app from its iTunes store.
[01:30:12.760 --> 01:30:15.760]  We have an article that's up on our website written by Dan Layman.
[01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:19.760]  This latest move, Apple has removed Breitbart News app from their iTunes marketplace.
[01:30:19.760 --> 01:30:23.760]  It's an utter censorship of free speech and truth journalism.
[01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:27.760]  They're kicking it into overdrive despite the app being available for the past three years.
[01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:32.760]  Now, Breitbart currently ranks 28th on similar web's top 100 media sites.
[01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:37.760]  And they had over 168 million page views in October alone.
[01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:41.760]  But their primary target for a massive concerted effort by these globalists is to suppress
[01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:45.760]  and silence all opposition deemed, quote, fake news, including us.
[01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:49.760]  Now, the war on Breitbart has increased because of CEO Steve Bannon,
[01:30:49.760 --> 01:30:53.760]  who was ultimately appointed as the White House Chief Strategist in this latest move.
[01:30:53.760 --> 01:30:55.760]  They're trying to silence all real news.
[01:30:55.760 --> 01:30:59.760]  I'm Margaret Hell reporting for InfoWars.com.
[01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:04.760]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical
[01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:09.760]  that we can produce about a group you took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[01:31:09.760 --> 01:31:12.760]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex,
[01:31:12.760 --> 01:31:14.760]  because I think it's very, very important.
[01:31:14.760 --> 01:31:21.760]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[01:31:21.760 --> 01:31:24.760]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[01:31:24.760 --> 01:31:26.760]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[01:31:26.760 --> 01:31:30.760]  It goes to PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[01:31:30.760 --> 01:31:33.760]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:35.760]  It works like an antioxidant.
[01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:38.760]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[01:31:38.760 --> 01:31:42.760]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount. It's in powder form.
[01:31:42.760 --> 01:31:45.760]  We have so many five-star reviews. I take this.
[01:31:45.760 --> 01:31:47.760]  This is the product that I take.
[01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:49.760]  InfoWars.com and the profit we make.
[01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:52.760]  We fight the globalists. We fight the New World Order.
[01:31:52.760 --> 01:31:59.760]  Secure your DNA Force today at infowarslife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:04.760]  We have the new product at infowarslife.com, Biotru Selenium.
[01:32:04.760 --> 01:32:07.760]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium.
[01:32:07.760 --> 01:32:15.760]  And just recently, we were able to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[01:32:15.760 --> 01:32:20.760]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[01:32:20.760 --> 01:32:24.760]  It's balanced the thyroid gland. It helps detoxify.
[01:32:24.760 --> 01:32:27.760]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[01:32:27.760 --> 01:32:32.760]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[01:32:32.760 --> 01:32:38.760]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[01:32:38.760 --> 01:32:43.760]  So it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:48.760]  I'm taking it now every day. This is soaking. Biotru Selenium is the product.
[01:32:48.760 --> 01:32:52.760]  The best selenium that we could bring. We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[01:32:52.760 --> 01:33:21.760]  Excusably available at m4warslife.com or by calling toll-free, triple-eight, two-five, three-three, one-three-nine.
[01:33:21.760 --> 01:33:27.760]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:30.760]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
