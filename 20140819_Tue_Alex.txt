[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:38.000]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:38.000 --> 00:42.120]  our reporters are on the ground in Ferguson Missouri that's now become an
[00:42.120 --> 00:46.760]  international news story and threatens to engulf the country in more riots and
[00:46.760 --> 00:52.160]  looting we're here trying to objectively break down how the police state is not
[00:52.160 --> 00:55.820]  good for anybody but the globalists that have hijacked his country nevertheless
[00:55.820 --> 01:02.280]  though there are miscreant forces coming into the area in Ferguson out of St.
[01:02.280 --> 01:07.800]  Louis trying to stir things up we've got the new black Panthers calling for
[01:07.800 --> 01:14.000]  violence we've got reports that our reporters have confirmed a mall off
[01:14.000 --> 01:19.080]  cocktails and shots being fired so the police then went completely wild and
[01:19.080 --> 01:23.640]  began attacking everyone including reporters and then they had a late-night
[01:23.640 --> 01:28.320]  press conference saying that well unless you have a $50,000 camera this is an
[01:28.320 --> 01:35.560]  actual quote and a news van basically we don't know you're a reporter so that
[01:35.560 --> 01:40.800]  is ongoing we had our reporters there in the press conference Joe Biggs
[01:40.800 --> 01:50.840]  literally right next to the state police spokesman and they would just ignore
[01:50.840 --> 01:59.480]  their serious questions so that's coming up the situation is obviously
[01:59.480 --> 02:04.200]  deteriorating quickly but we need to look at all the other news the open
[02:04.200 --> 02:08.720]  borders the wars the globalists are starting the destabilization the
[02:08.720 --> 02:12.280]  Middle East the ongoing devaluation of the dollar they don't have a guest on

[02:18.520 --> 02:22.960]  and sell the book it's a world that daily book and the book is so informative
[02:22.960 --> 02:28.000]  that I actually learned something from it and I don't say that arrogantly I'm
[02:28.000 --> 02:32.880]  probably the leading expert when it comes to full spectrum analysis of how
[02:32.880 --> 02:36.160]  the police state really works just because I've been studying it reading
[02:36.160 --> 02:43.440]  Iran corporation documents reading the Pentagon papers for almost two decades I
[02:43.440 --> 02:50.320]  didn't wake up to this for a couple years on air so maybe 18 years and her
[02:50.320 --> 02:56.760]  books powerful because she's a well-known journalist did a deep research on
[02:56.760 --> 03:00.440]  what's currently going on so she'll be joining us to discuss the police state
[03:00.440 --> 03:05.280]  that finally people are getting concerned about and we say police state
[03:05.280 --> 03:09.440]  the slang connotation is that means not liking police and that's how they've
[03:09.440 --> 03:14.280]  brainwashed the police that if someone talks about a police state why you don't
[03:14.280 --> 03:18.560]  like the police no but we don't like is living in a mix of North Korea and
[03:18.560 --> 03:24.720]  Nazi Germany meets Mexico meets Guatemala meets Nigeria when you have
[03:24.720 --> 03:31.400]  tanks and police and paramilitary uniforms wearing masks you you live in a
[03:31.400 --> 03:36.200]  third-world country you live in an unstable cesspit when they're rolling
[03:36.200 --> 03:41.560]  around with sand sound cannons and rubber bullets and the rest of it this
[03:41.560 --> 03:46.760]  is the sign of a country in deep trouble along with our giant untenable
[03:46.760 --> 03:52.080]  fraudulent debt along with the NSA spying along with the president operating
[03:52.080 --> 03:58.840]  as a dictator this country is a mess and we've got military police now joined by
[03:58.840 --> 04:05.840]  the National Guard militarized police now join with the National Guard pointing
[04:05.840 --> 04:14.760]  guns now into week two almost week three coming up at our reporters and being
[04:14.760 --> 04:20.440]  very aggressive and very hateful which if you were even an occupying army would
[04:20.440 --> 04:26.760]  not be a good bearing to have it would cause more resistance which shows you
[04:26.760 --> 04:33.040]  the training is all for an perfect storm of just disaster so we'll look at all
[04:33.040 --> 04:40.000]  of it coming up and then Cheryl Chumling police state USA will be joining us I

[08:33.720 --> 08:40.400]  ladies and gentlemen we are live broadcasting worldwide from Austin
[08:40.400 --> 08:46.360]  Texas our reporters now going into week number two have been reporting on the
[08:46.360 --> 08:55.040]  ground from Ferguson Missouri on what is a demo for martial law nation-wide and
[08:55.040 --> 09:00.280]  our reporters have gotten video of this they can confirm that journalists are
[09:00.280 --> 09:09.960]  having rocks thrown at them by the supposedly perfect angel protesters there
[09:09.960 --> 09:14.040]  are mall off cocktails being thrown at the police there are shots being fired
[09:14.040 --> 09:23.760]  this did happen last night and it's ongoing and the hoodlums that have come
[09:23.760 --> 09:28.280]  into the area as the head of the state police has said have invaded and are
[09:28.280 --> 09:35.240]  using all of the bedlam like criminals do to basically engage in criminal
[09:35.240 --> 09:41.360]  activity looting you name it and they're even attacking CNN reporters and others
[09:41.360 --> 09:49.280]  there's now video of that headline police in Ferguson arrest Getty
[09:49.280 --> 09:53.640]  photographer Scott Olson that's happening on the other side so you've got
[09:53.640 --> 09:57.440]  the police arresting reporters tear gassing them shooting them with rubber
[09:57.440 --> 10:04.000]  bullets aiming guns at them and you've got the hoodlums attacking them truly
[10:04.000 --> 10:12.800]  disgusting there's a lot of bullying and fuggish behavior going on and I've
[10:12.800 --> 10:24.520]  likened out-of-control police agencies over the years to a street gang and it's
[10:24.520 --> 10:29.920]  so bad that I'm just tempted to pull my reporters completely out of there and
[10:29.920 --> 10:33.320]  just have them cover the press conferences and talk to eyewitnesses and
[10:33.320 --> 10:37.720]  just report on other people's live feeds because there's no point in letting a
[10:37.720 --> 10:43.640]  bunch of gangbangers stab or shoot my reporters and by the way every time I
[10:43.640 --> 10:47.360]  criticize all the gangbangers with their pants hanging down around their butts
[10:47.360 --> 10:51.960]  and running around cussing everybody and breaking out windows I see comments on
[10:51.960 --> 10:57.160]  info wars.com prisonplanet.com and YouTube going I knew you were racist
[10:57.160 --> 11:04.640]  Alex in all caps why are you hating on people these are the type of comments
[11:04.640 --> 11:09.720]  that you can go to the website and read you understand I don't like the police
[11:09.720 --> 11:14.800]  driving around in m-wraps with sound cannons attacking the press I don't like
[11:14.800 --> 11:18.520]  the NSA illegally spying on me I don't like the wide open borders I don't like
[11:18.520 --> 11:22.080]  the fact we're sold out to foreign banks and being maneuvered towards economic
[11:22.080 --> 11:28.320]  collapse I don't like the fact that it's a premeditated slide towards the
[11:28.320 --> 11:33.720]  Talitarianism in this country on record but it doesn't mean then I endorse a
[11:33.720 --> 11:44.400]  bunch of hoodlum people showing up out of areas of St. Louis to run around and
[11:44.400 --> 11:50.040]  say we've been oppressed so we're gonna attack reporters and people even
[11:50.040 --> 11:55.280]  reporters that are there spewing political correct baloney it's amazing
[11:55.280 --> 11:58.800]  that because somebody got shot and killed now that gives a bunch of
[11:58.800 --> 12:04.560]  criminals a right to loot and burn stuff down I got mad when the police were
[12:04.560 --> 12:09.960]  shooting with rubber bullets my reporters Joe Biggs and Jacarie Jackson and
[12:09.960 --> 12:20.160]  Josh Owens flashbanging the car Josh was in attacking the Al Jazeera reporters
[12:20.160 --> 12:24.120]  and arresting the Washington Post reporter while Jacarie was there they
[12:24.120 --> 12:27.960]  were shooting rubber bullets tear gas and they run up and they break down the
[12:27.960 --> 12:33.040]  camera equipment chase the reporters down the road and then they go on the
[12:33.040 --> 12:36.880]  news the next day and say no we were helping the reporters they thanked us so
[12:36.880 --> 12:40.320]  we went and found the reporters and they said no of course we don't thank them
[12:40.320 --> 12:46.240]  it's pure bull it's just a culture of lying everywhere it's just disgusting
[12:46.240 --> 12:51.520]  and more and more in America that's what we see just where everybody is acting
[12:51.520 --> 12:58.040]  like a bunch of hoodlum crazy gangsters just wanting to dominate and push
[12:58.040 --> 13:02.400]  people around it's the end of chivalry it is the end of common sense it's the
[13:02.400 --> 13:08.240]  end of being honorable it is just truly disgusting we have more videos of our
[13:08.240 --> 13:13.480]  reporters on the sidewalk and other reporters and then the police just walk
[13:13.480 --> 13:22.880]  up with M4s with live ammo in them and others with shotguns with rubber bullets
[13:22.880 --> 13:27.640]  in them five feet away if you shoot somebody with rubber bullets at five
[13:27.640 --> 13:33.640]  feet away you will kill them there been a lot of rubber bullet deaths you see
[13:33.640 --> 13:36.520]  them in the news all the time in the back of the paper famous one was the
[13:36.520 --> 13:41.040]  Red Sox one remember the World Series I don't know it was like eight nine years
[13:41.040 --> 13:50.840]  ago I forget and a girl with no criminal record college student with her
[13:50.840 --> 13:55.480]  boyfriend no criminal record not even a misdemeanor like 10 30 at night when
[13:55.480 --> 13:58.960]  they won walked out of a restaurant she wasn't even there for the Red Sox and
[13:58.960 --> 14:02.640]  the riot police were clearing people off the street that had dumped some stuff
[14:02.640 --> 14:08.160]  over and a cop a senior one walked right up at ten feet away there it is
[14:08.160 --> 14:13.240]  death of Victoria Schnell Grove and shot her in the eyes and nose driving her
[14:13.240 --> 14:18.800]  eyeballs back into her brain the cops you know they're very proud of
[14:18.800 --> 14:23.920]  themselves oh that's just what happens you got cops with shotguns pointing them
[14:23.920 --> 14:27.600]  at people's heads ladies and gentlemen with rubber bullets and and two to three
[14:27.600 --> 14:37.360]  rounds that aren't rubber and I just can't handle it
[14:41.480 --> 14:46.320]  it makes me want to throw up and the whole things can try if you've got the
[14:46.320 --> 14:53.000]  black Panthers the new black Panthers which are basically a black clan group
[14:53.000 --> 14:56.960]  running around you know saying it's time for violence I've got their quotes
[14:56.960 --> 15:01.880]  here got another article out on an info wars calm last night that scrolled off
[15:01.880 --> 15:06.760]  you guys print that for me it's in the featured news archive and then you've
[15:06.760 --> 15:10.360]  got all these other people that are just upset about their lives upset that they
[15:10.360 --> 15:13.200]  don't have good-paying jobs or the welfare checks aren't big enough or
[15:13.200 --> 15:16.920]  they're scared and tired being pushed around by the cops they're out
[15:16.920 --> 15:28.600]  protesting and in and then just mixed in with it are all these hoodlums and I'm
[15:28.600 --> 15:33.240]  just sick of the hoodlum culture that's sold and promoted by MTV and the radio
[15:33.240 --> 15:38.760]  and the culture across the board it's not just inner-city blacks there's all
[15:38.760 --> 15:46.800]  sorts of versions of weird bully fake tough guy weird country rap and and and
[15:46.800 --> 15:54.040]  weird hoodlum rock and roll and just just a culture of just trashiness men who
[15:54.040 --> 16:00.120]  aren't men men that never had dads around people that just think acting like
[16:00.120 --> 16:07.080]  thugs is tough and is cool we've got some of those clips coming up and I see
[16:07.080 --> 16:10.960]  the hoodlums with masks on their faces covering up who they are and the police
[16:10.960 --> 16:17.400]  doing it and just the rudeness
[16:22.600 --> 16:28.840]  it freaks me out because what's gonna happen when the dollar fully devalues
[16:28.840 --> 16:35.240]  what's gonna happen as the industrial base sinks even faster and we've got
[16:35.240 --> 16:39.240]  people that are third fourth fifth generation living on welfare in the
[16:39.240 --> 16:44.560]  countryside in the inner cities everywhere who don't know how to provide
[16:44.560 --> 16:52.120]  for themselves what's going to happen during this flux where the robots
[16:52.120 --> 16:58.280]  replace the humans with most jobs from custodial positions to factory jobs to
[16:58.280 --> 17:06.280]  driverless cars what's gonna happen is the designed implosion of society and I
[17:06.280 --> 17:15.880]  liken it to a Mars mission that takes a year there six months on the ground and
[17:15.880 --> 17:21.000]  a year back the reason they haven't launched a Mars mission is because it's
[17:21.000 --> 17:27.240]  cost prohibitive but also because most of the people that go will probably end
[17:27.240 --> 17:30.920]  up having heart attacks once they get there on the way back because no matter
[17:30.920 --> 17:37.200]  how much exercise they do even if it's a spacecraft that's spinning that creates
[17:37.200 --> 17:42.960]  some centrifugal force and some gravity the people will be like
[17:42.960 --> 17:52.560]  invalids once they return to earth even if they survive you say what's that have
[17:52.560 --> 17:59.920]  to do with this we are immersed in a whole new culture of GMO and electrical
[17:59.920 --> 18:05.920]  frequency pollution and chemicals in the food and water and hundreds of hours a
[18:05.920 --> 18:13.320]  week for many people for a lot of folks 30 40 50 hours a week of television and
[18:13.320 --> 18:20.200]  screen time and you can see the IQ is dropping you can see the numbers of
[18:20.200 --> 18:26.760]  diseases and illnesses skyrocketing you can see the mutation and the devolution
[18:26.760 --> 18:36.000]  of humanity in front of everyone the deep the degeneration I think about the
[18:36.000 --> 18:40.000]  people I knew when I was a little kid in the countryside that were super hard
[18:40.000 --> 18:47.800]  working super good-looking super tough super cool and now I go back to where my
[18:47.800 --> 18:51.640]  family's from and it looks like people that are still alive there haven't moved
[18:51.640 --> 18:55.800]  out have been hit by mutation rays and all they do is watch satellite TV all
[18:55.800 --> 18:59.920]  day if they even have a job in town it's at a prison or at a power plant and
[18:59.920 --> 19:06.960]  there's no culture and they are literally just waiting to die
[19:10.080 --> 19:15.840]  and I see the young people not even so much my family but just the locals and
[19:15.840 --> 19:22.320]  they look like absolute hell and never even basically get out of their pajamas
[19:22.320 --> 19:27.000]  all day long even if they go to a job and then I see the inner city people
[19:27.000 --> 19:30.640]  it's just exactly the same thing it's not that I'm putting them down because

[24:18.840 --> 24:34.920]  so that's about me baby baby baby
[24:36.400 --> 24:44.520]  Alex Jones here back live I was trying to draw the parallel of the analogy to
[24:44.520 --> 24:50.160]  the unnaturalness of humans and zero gravity and how that's prohibitive to
[24:50.160 --> 24:58.400]  long term or long duration missions in space and I was likening it to the
[24:58.400 --> 25:03.840]  artificial environment we're in with the smartphones and the electromagnetic
[25:03.840 --> 25:08.760]  frequencies in the GMO and the chemicals and in the psychological warfare and the
[25:08.760 --> 25:15.040]  cultural breakdown and also the easiness of life compared to what it used to be
[25:15.040 --> 25:19.840]  you get a welfare check you go get food even though it's GMO crud you can lay
[25:19.840 --> 25:23.560]  around and watch Judge Judy all day you can lay around and watch Oprah Winfrey
[25:23.560 --> 25:29.080]  all day and then see stories of the rich and famous and have class envy of
[25:29.080 --> 25:33.600]  people that have yachts and helicopters and then you go to the shopping mall and
[25:33.600 --> 25:38.520]  you see the folks that are exercising you see the middle class that's got money
[25:38.520 --> 25:42.720]  and it's got money to not eat GMO and they look healthy but they're black or
[25:42.720 --> 25:49.760]  white or Hispanic and you are envious of them you hate them and that's what you
[25:49.760 --> 25:55.520]  see when the dumb down country folks come into town in the big city and see
[25:55.520 --> 25:59.840]  the beautiful people in the elite areas of town they get freaked out they get
[25:59.840 --> 26:05.800]  insecure that's what happens when you get the dumb down poisoned inner city
[26:05.800 --> 26:11.360]  people struggling to try to make it as well but born into an artificial sick
[26:11.360 --> 26:16.400]  culture where we abort millions of children a year and just say they're
[26:16.400 --> 26:24.000]  not humans not even knowing any better so I don't sit up here and look at poor
[26:24.000 --> 26:28.440]  pathetic country people whether they be black or white or Hispanic and look
[26:28.440 --> 26:34.240]  down my nose at them I don't look at poor inner city black people dumb down
[26:34.240 --> 26:40.400]  ignorant brought up in the system I feel sorry for them but at the same time they
[26:40.400 --> 26:46.320]  have been forged into a political weapon just like the poor people pouring in
[26:46.320 --> 26:51.040]  from Nicaragua and Al Salvador and Guatemala some of the most dangerous
[26:51.040 --> 26:57.840]  broken places in the world a poisonous transfusion
[26:57.840 --> 27:04.160]  shining them on to the Democratic Party and the welfare class to be the new
[27:04.160 --> 27:10.480]  political enforcer class in this country you can see what the
[27:10.480 --> 27:19.920]  technocracies doing shipping in unlimited numbers of Somalis into
[27:19.920 --> 27:25.800]  Minnesota into New York into Las Vegas to take over the cab businesses I'm not
[27:25.800 --> 27:30.680]  against the Somali people but you talk about coming some from somewhere with a
[27:30.680 --> 27:37.400]  total breakdown of society an absolute stone age level barbarism and culture
[27:37.400 --> 27:44.640]  and women treated worse than animals and it's politically correct oh what a
[27:44.640 --> 27:50.560]  neat culture let's adopt it oh my gosh you're wearing Levi's you're a white
[27:50.560 --> 27:55.680]  guy driving a truck that's sick and racist and homophobic I bet you don't
[27:55.680 --> 28:00.760]  know how to read the New York Times oh my gosh look at the white man how bad he
[28:00.760 --> 28:07.840]  is but oh oh you're from Somalia or Sudan where they sexually mutilate the
[28:07.840 --> 28:11.800]  girls and don't let them out of the house and then we can chain women up in
[28:11.800 --> 28:16.440]  houses here in America oh that's their culture well my culture is owning guns
[28:16.440 --> 28:20.760]  and treating women good and having private property and being wealthy and
[28:20.760 --> 28:25.520]  being successful and not being treated like a slave by the police and I'm
[28:25.520 --> 28:29.520]  uppity and I'm not gonna back down and I'm not gonna be pushed around and
[28:29.520 --> 28:33.840]  that's why the police treat me with respect because they know I'll take them
[28:33.840 --> 28:40.280]  to court they know I'll stand up to them they want to be my servant they want to
[28:40.280 --> 28:44.280]  be a defender of the Constitution I'll support them I'll admire them they want
[28:44.280 --> 28:48.000]  to turn into paramilitary thugs sitting on top of a rotting country full of
[28:48.000 --> 28:53.360]  bunch of dumbed-down trash I'm not gonna be treated like all the trash I'm not
[28:53.360 --> 28:57.000]  gonna lay down on the gutter I'm not gonna be run over anymore I'm not gonna
[28:57.000 --> 29:00.720]  have bureaucrats come in my house or come in my office without warrants I'm
[29:00.720 --> 29:06.160]  not gonna kiss up to uniforms and badges all that is is like ancients
[29:06.160 --> 29:11.240]  wearing headdresses or crowns I don't like the Queen of England I'm not gonna
[29:11.240 --> 29:14.920]  bow down to her if she walked by they invited me to go meet the Queen of
[29:14.920 --> 29:19.080]  England but said I had to bow to her that woman living off the people of
[29:19.080 --> 29:23.440]  England and her family bunch of usurpers for hundreds of years make me want to
[29:23.440 --> 29:29.200]  throw up all of your ceremonial outfits all your headdresses all of your
[29:29.200 --> 29:35.640]  costumes all of it don't mean jack crap if they don't symbolize the republic and
[29:35.640 --> 29:42.280]  freedom then I'm all four symbols symbols or power Milan Lombay I'll wear a
[29:42.280 --> 29:47.080]  decoration of a nickel belt buckle that celebrates men not turning their guns
[29:47.080 --> 29:51.400]  in or their weapons on the face of tyrants the empires on the run whether
[29:51.400 --> 29:56.080]  it be the leader of Alex Jones and the GCN radio George III or Santa Anna
[29:56.080 --> 30:03.120]  Mexico from the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself our world
[30:03.120 --> 30:07.000]  is becoming more and more toxic each and every day but it's not just the air
[30:07.000 --> 30:11.040]  outside that's toxic indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher
[30:11.040 --> 30:15.240]  concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90
[30:15.240 --> 30:19.080]  percent of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes there are
[30:19.080 --> 30:23.200]  more than 42 million smokers in the United States well over a thousand
[30:23.200 --> 30:26.880]  types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't forget
[30:26.880 --> 30:30.360]  the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well
[30:30.360 --> 30:33.960]  when I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time
[30:33.960 --> 30:38.480]  to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we
[30:38.480 --> 30:42.320]  cannot escape but we can fight back against made with organic and wild

[31:01.400 --> 31:06.080]  was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify most people know
[31:06.080 --> 31:11.800]  that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world. Iodine is key to so
[31:11.800 --> 31:16.040]  many of the body's functions especially the thyroid. I discovered a product
[31:16.040 --> 31:21.000]  being developed by Dr. Group you now know it as survival shield true nascent
[31:21.000 --> 31:25.280]  iodine that your body can really absorb then about a year ago he said listen if

[33:20.280 --> 33:25.680]  I want to open the phones up to get your take on Ferguson. The clear evidence that
[33:25.680 --> 33:30.880]  there are Justice Department, New Black Panther Party, troublemakers. They're
[33:30.880 --> 33:37.840]  clearly trying to stir up violence. Our reporters almost got hit by a car the
[33:37.840 --> 33:41.080]  other night driving through the crowd that looked like they were targeting on
[33:41.080 --> 33:47.280]  the people jumped out and ski mask and then ran off. We've got MSNBC reporters
[33:47.280 --> 33:52.280]  CNN reporters being hit by rocks over the last few days. Chris Hayes was the
[33:52.280 --> 34:00.880]  latest and we've got CNN reporters being arrested by the police. It's a bunch of
[34:00.880 --> 34:09.180]  mindless barbarism and it really displays how ignorant the public is but
[34:09.180 --> 34:16.880]  also how ignorant the police are of just what's going on around them and from the
[34:16.880 --> 34:22.080]  beginning the feds have been there advising and even before the beginning of
[34:22.080 --> 34:26.480]  this the feds were there giving them the training and that leads me to the story
[34:26.480 --> 34:33.680]  that's up on drudgereport.com it's up on info wars.com we ended the broadcast
[34:33.680 --> 34:38.600]  yesterday as this story broke document army preparing to use lethal force
[34:38.600 --> 34:44.320]  against unarmed civilians during full-scale riots in the United States
[34:44.320 --> 34:49.080]  but they need to set the precedent so the military and the police feel like
[34:49.080 --> 34:58.600]  this is a reasonable mission. So on the left hand side of drudge army manual
[34:58.600 --> 35:05.120]  details preparations for full-scale riots in the USA and shooting quote unarmed
[35:05.120 --> 35:11.600]  civilians with sniper response lethal sniper response you can read the
[35:11.600 --> 35:19.080]  declassified publicly released army document released last Friday the public
[35:19.080 --> 35:25.080]  discovered it yesterday we wrote about it. No dinosaur media has picked up on
[35:25.080 --> 35:30.960]  this bombshell document yet. In fact guys I printed the document yesterday it's
[35:30.960 --> 35:35.600]  in the TV studio so may I'll give you that thank you so much
[35:35.600 --> 35:47.320]  but all Americans are being robbed by the globalist all Americans 99.99% of us
[35:47.320 --> 35:53.680]  are on the bad receiving end of this tyranny and all of us should value
[35:53.680 --> 36:01.240]  freedom value justice value the truth and decry everything we see that is a
[36:01.240 --> 36:06.360]  problem and try to do something about it. I want to give the phone number out and
[36:06.360 --> 36:09.560]  then when we start the next hour we're gonna talk to our reporters on the
[36:09.560 --> 36:14.200]  ground about what they witnessed in Ferguson and more and we're gonna
[36:14.200 --> 36:24.200]  break down civil disturbances manual ATP 3-39.33 that was created in April of
[36:24.200 --> 36:30.240]  this year and approved for public release distribution unlimited last Friday
[36:30.240 --> 36:37.320]  headquarters department of the Army. Northcom is now operating openly against
[36:37.320 --> 36:43.040]  the American people the army is publicly along with the Marines training to take
[36:43.040 --> 36:46.720]  on the Tea Party gun owners rural communities that will not go under
[36:46.720 --> 36:57.360]  martial law that is the main focus on record they will use unsavory thugs and
[36:57.360 --> 37:01.600]  people opportunistically burning down buildings and throwing them all off
[37:01.600 --> 37:08.080]  cocktails at police as the pretext to roll out the m-raps the sound cannons
[37:08.080 --> 37:12.040]  the rubber bullets the cameras and microphones on the street corners that
[37:12.040 --> 37:19.960]  are beyond 1984 that's what's happening they will use the threat of Al Qaeda to
[37:19.960 --> 37:25.240]  take our liberties as well and publicly arm them when the public wakes up they
[37:25.240 --> 37:33.040]  just rename them ISIS ISIS ISIS IS all the different names that they've given
[37:33.040 --> 37:38.120]  it to confuse the public this is a psi-op this is being run against the
[37:38.120 --> 37:43.760]  people of Ferguson against the thugs that have come in against the state
[37:43.760 --> 37:49.320]  police the local police the National Guard they're all there compartmentalized
[37:49.320 --> 37:56.480]  being taught the new police state model that was rolled out in Seattle in 99 and
[37:56.480 --> 38:06.600]  Katrina in 2005 and at the WTO we caught the WTO
[38:06.600 --> 38:21.640]  repeatedly in Canada in Ottawa in London England in Hitchburg Pennsylvania on
[38:21.640 --> 38:25.040]  record even came out mainstream news police dressed up like anarchist
[38:25.040 --> 38:30.640]  attacking police show that they would have a pretext of the attack the crowd
[38:30.640 --> 38:38.600]  we have not seen any clear verified evidence of that this time because
[38:38.600 --> 38:43.280]  there are reporters there and we know what to look for or it could be that the
[38:43.280 --> 38:46.600]  police are being moral
[38:50.560 --> 38:56.280]  but it is on record that they hired anarchist and provocateurs protected
[38:56.280 --> 39:02.040]  them the Delta Force ran it that came out in three Seattle papers Seattle
[39:02.040 --> 39:07.880]  Post intelligence sir you name it I made a film about it but I do know it's
[39:07.880 --> 39:12.080]  being provocateur by the tax-free foundations Ford Foundation and others
[39:12.080 --> 39:17.320]  that are on record funding the Black Panther Party the new Black Panther
[39:17.320 --> 39:22.920]  Party La Raza Metsha all these race-based groups they've caught the
[39:22.920 --> 39:27.280]  Southern Parvy Law Center and other groups running white supremacist groups
[39:27.280 --> 39:34.080]  not to infiltrate groups setting them up to then run around and say unsavory
[39:34.080 --> 39:39.720]  things to stir up communities so they can drive the black community into the
[39:39.720 --> 39:46.080]  hands of the mindless idiot clowns of the new Black Panther Party who
[39:46.080 --> 39:56.480]  undoubtedly are useful idiots in the lower-ranked feds at the top
[39:58.760 --> 40:03.720]  remember Khalid Muhammad we kill the women we kill the children we kill the
[40:03.720 --> 40:07.920]  babies we kill the beautiful blue-eyed babies that's right because the blue-eyed
[40:07.920 --> 40:12.880]  baby the blue-eyed baby is gonna grow up to be a big devil and gonna try to kill
[40:12.880 --> 40:17.520]  our babies and then every nine months the white woman lays on her back and
[40:17.520 --> 40:24.800]  out rolls reinforcements to the military manufacturing center by the way you
[40:24.800 --> 40:28.560]  could actually pull up that clip I can almost do a perfect imitation I love
[40:28.560 --> 40:35.680]  to do imitations as everybody knows oh dear pesky earth creature you'll say I'm
[40:35.680 --> 40:39.040]  racist doing a Khalid Muhammad
[40:39.040 --> 40:47.480]  imitation I'm not against Martians I just did a Martian imitation what about

[41:08.600 --> 41:15.240]  want to talk to first-time callers about Ferguson but also entertain me in this
[41:15.240 --> 41:21.440]  what else is this diverting and distracting us from Obama has ended our
[41:21.440 --> 41:26.160]  borders legalized all the illegals that story starts to really wake people up

[41:41.680 --> 41:44.600]  across the board because of them shutting down farms all over the country
[41:44.600 --> 41:53.120]  and dollar evaluations no one's talking about in Texas Breitbart 45 million to
[41:53.120 --> 42:06.120]  educate foreign minors just this year according to the Texas Comptroller the
[42:06.120 --> 42:14.520]  Texas Education General Counsel audit no one's talking about it because there's
[42:14.520 --> 42:21.440]  just this big pageant of oh my gosh somebody got killed one man dies it's a
[42:21.440 --> 42:27.640]  tragedy 10,000 died so statistic Joseph Stalin said that and it's true you
[42:27.640 --> 42:31.080]  abort 50% of blacks I talked to black folks about that liberal blacks they go
[42:31.080 --> 42:36.440]  good nobody wants them nobody want them ugly black babies I mean you've heard
[42:36.440 --> 42:41.920]  that I've played the clips here I've had black leaders in my studio
[42:41.920 --> 42:45.360]  socialists in front of Rob do I never even aired the interview was so
[42:45.360 --> 42:51.360]  and sickening basically saying yeah too many black people I mean it's so sick
[42:51.360 --> 42:55.280]  because they're the inside operatives of the Democratic Party there to make
[42:55.280 --> 43:00.200]  sure blacks never find liberty never find monetary success or dangle out oh
[43:00.200 --> 43:04.560]  you could be a rap star or an NFL football player I mean how many slots
[43:04.560 --> 43:13.320]  are there for professional sports or to be a hip-hop sensation maybe 10,000
[43:13.320 --> 43:18.400]  slots for all the professional sports and all the rap jobs and all the
[43:18.400 --> 43:23.640]  coolness you've got how many million black people in this country 12% of
[43:23.640 --> 43:33.440]  populations black what's 12% divided out of 315 million I know that it there's
[43:33.440 --> 43:39.800]  not a slot for 99.9% of people but but you'd believe everybody and by the way
[43:39.800 --> 43:43.280]  it's not black folks they're not the only ones almost every white person I
[43:43.280 --> 43:46.960]  know coming out of college thinks they're gonna be a rock star a hip-hop
[43:46.960 --> 43:51.440]  star or a movie star and they're all totally delusional running around
[43:51.440 --> 43:55.880]  looking for movie stars all around them I mean what a delusional society
[43:55.880 --> 44:02.400]  everybody wants to be some big star it is just so bizarre because that's how
[44:02.400 --> 44:06.880]  you attain something you don't be an honorable father an honorable mother and
[44:06.880 --> 44:10.360]  help your community and build a better society and do wood carving in the
[44:10.360 --> 44:13.760]  garage or paint and go sell your paintings on the weekends cuz you love
[44:13.760 --> 44:18.720]  them or get into gardening or get into mountain biking or rock climbing or get
[44:18.720 --> 44:24.080]  into you know going and helping at the local shelter or poetry there are a lot
[44:24.080 --> 44:27.680]  of happy people that have their hobby their passion they're fulfilled they're
[44:27.680 --> 44:32.480]  not depressed but you've got all these young people and all these yuppies I
[44:32.480 --> 44:36.000]  mean let me tell you living in Austin now Austin has been ruined where I live
[44:36.000 --> 44:41.840]  toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231 we're gonna open the phone
[44:41.840 --> 44:51.920]  system up right now 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 I'm just getting into the
[44:51.920 --> 44:58.760]  basic problem in society LA has collapsed you've got the young woman of
[44:58.760 --> 45:02.840]  America every beautiful girl when she's 18 I mean a large percentage of them
[45:02.840 --> 45:06.000]  try to go there to be movie stars they go yeah I got a movie you can be a
[45:06.000 --> 45:13.160]  star in then there's such a glut of young women having sex on tape that it
[45:13.160 --> 45:17.560]  drives the prices down where they don't even make the money a hooker makes you
[45:17.560 --> 45:23.000]  make less money in porn than you would make selling your body because the
[45:23.000 --> 45:29.520]  market is such a glut but they called you a star so you did it
[45:29.520 --> 45:41.280]  see but I'm a star I'm in playboy oh my gosh why she's a model for this or a
[45:41.280 --> 45:48.360]  model for that and then those women even the ones that are able to have some
[45:48.360 --> 45:54.040]  success in that they're totally unhappy or when their looks go they kill
[45:54.040 --> 45:57.960]  themselves they never had kids never had grandkids never experienced the
[45:57.960 --> 46:04.400]  lifecycle never experienced the racial memories that are activated in your race
[46:04.400 --> 46:11.640]  memory when you follow the rites of passage 41 million black people in the
[46:11.640 --> 46:15.200]  United States we've been given the number and there's about 10,000 slots to
[46:15.200 --> 46:24.280]  be a star maybe and a lot of those slots are C and D and F down to Z level
[46:24.280 --> 46:28.480]  celebrities so then there's all these industries now where everyone's going to
[46:28.480 --> 46:34.960]  be a tango dancer or a tap dancer or they're going to be a in a marching band
[46:34.960 --> 46:39.080]  or they're going to be in acting lessons and it's all these delusional people
[46:39.080 --> 46:44.040]  going and taking acting lessons over and over and over again to try to be movie
[46:44.040 --> 46:48.000]  stars try to be extras in a movie to try to and then they worship whoever's been
[46:48.000 --> 46:54.600]  successful and it's so boring so unfulfilling so fake and the point is if
[46:54.600 --> 46:58.000]  they just randomly like to go take acting classes and want to want to be
[46:58.000 --> 47:03.720]  extras in movies because they like it that's fine but that's not what 90 plus
[47:03.720 --> 47:09.880]  percent of them are doing they're doing it because they feel unfulfilled unless
[47:09.880 --> 47:14.520]  they can be on the television or on the big screen I've been on the big screen
[47:14.520 --> 47:18.160]  never tried to be in movies was putting movies I've been offered to be in a
[47:18.160 --> 47:23.320]  bunch of other movies big roles I said no because I know how boring it is I
[47:23.320 --> 47:27.760]  don't want to quit my radio show and go live in Los Angeles or go live in New
[47:27.760 --> 47:34.160]  Zealand or go live in Toronto or New York and just be in that empty culture do
[47:34.160 --> 47:40.360]  you know how empty the people are that are movie stars do you know how unhappy
[47:40.360 --> 47:46.400]  they are why do you think Hollywood over and over again has reached out to me
[47:46.400 --> 47:51.000]  it's because they're looking for something real and the ones that are
[47:51.000 --> 47:56.240]  awake are talking about these issues now like Richard Linklater who's always
[47:56.240 --> 48:04.640]  been awakened never been into celebrity the films he makes I'm gonna take your

[49:37.680 --> 49:40.400]  falls into the hands of the system that uses it

[54:35.360 --> 54:40.720]  Austrian Goths and it's the exact same tribal stuff the exact same manipulation
[54:40.720 --> 54:48.720]  the exact same police shield walls and phalanxes nothing really changes and how
[54:48.720 --> 54:53.280]  to manipulate crowds and how to provocateur and how to divide and conquer
[54:53.280 --> 54:57.600]  and how to set the women up as the rulers over the men and then I just sit
[54:57.600 --> 55:02.160]  here and watch the social engineering going on as the Pentagon prepares to

[56:20.000 --> 56:27.360]  little bit angry I'm just watching the premeditated divide and conquer take down
[56:27.360 --> 56:31.760]  of our country and it makes me want to throw up and if the public would just
[56:31.760 --> 56:36.400]  wake up to it we could turn this whole thing around the Russian in Washington
[56:36.400 --> 56:43.560]  you're on the air go ahead yeah hey Alex Russian here the reason I put my name
[56:43.560 --> 56:48.000]  like that is so people can understand that I really am from Russia moved here
[56:48.000 --> 56:52.920]  in 91 after the collapse of the Soviet Union and I'm I just wanted to give a
[56:52.920 --> 56:57.920]  little bit of background I was very interesting as you can parallel living
[56:57.920 --> 57:02.040]  under communism versus what you see happening here go ahead well yeah
[57:02.040 --> 57:06.920]  exactly at my point I moved here after the collapse of the Soviet Union and I
[57:06.920 --> 57:11.120]  currently live in battleground Washington what I what I don't understand is
[57:11.120 --> 57:15.640]  like for example our family we all moved here and my parents obviously I have
[57:15.640 --> 57:20.080]  lived under the Soviet communism for quite a quite a bit and after they moved
[57:20.080 --> 57:25.080]  here things started to change their minds started to change and after I would
[57:25.080 --> 57:29.160]  know like maybe five ten years my parents just kind of went silent about
[57:29.160 --> 57:33.720]  Russia and the United States and when we first moved here it was a great country
[57:33.720 --> 57:36.960]  we live in Toledo Ohio we could leave the doors and windows open at night and
[57:36.960 --> 57:40.920]  nobody ever came in nobody stole anything everything was perfectly fine now
[57:40.920 --> 57:44.680]  the economy is degraded the people have degraded the minds of the you know the
[57:44.680 --> 57:49.080]  inhabitants of the United States have completely gone AWOL and now it's gone
[57:49.080 --> 57:53.200]  to the point to where even my own parents are in denial I'm like hey the
[57:53.200 --> 57:56.040]  economy is collapsing everything's getting worse you know I showed them
[57:56.040 --> 57:59.720]  evidence and documents news articles everything I tried to explain it to them
[57:59.720 --> 58:03.360]  and they look at me and they're like oh nothing's ever gonna happen to the United
[58:03.360 --> 58:07.040]  States I'm like are you kidding me it's like we came from Russia where everything
[58:07.040 --> 58:11.800]  collapsed you knew that everything was going down the Afghani war that was
[58:11.800 --> 58:16.080]  never ending was part of the reason of Russia's bankrupt America has so many
[58:16.080 --> 58:19.320]  wars that were currently in we have bases around the world we have over a
[58:19.320 --> 58:23.200]  hundred bases around the world and we've been maneuvered artificially to do that
[58:23.200 --> 58:31.400]  excellent points people have become spectators television has done it the
[58:31.400 --> 58:36.280]  the minds have been programmed for the public to be jellyfish and to not even
[58:36.280 --> 58:41.920]  be real people thank you for listening by the way I wasn't complaining about
[58:41.920 --> 58:46.600]  people call themselves the Russian man with I was just in a really bad mood for
[58:46.600 --> 58:50.480]  a moment nothing to do with you guys we'll be back I began to get into iodine a
[58:50.480 --> 58:54.040]  few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and
[58:54.040 --> 58:59.360]  detoxify most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the
[58:59.360 --> 59:04.600]  world iodine is key to so many of the body's functions especially the thyroid
[59:04.600 --> 59:08.800]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group you now know it as
[59:08.800 --> 59:14.040]  survival shield true nascent iodine that your body can really absorb then about
[59:14.040 --> 59:17.440]  a year ago he said listen if you think this is powerful I'm going to come out
[59:17.440 --> 59:22.800]  with rare earth deep earth crystals and the results that I personally have had
[59:22.800 --> 59:28.440]  have been life-changing nobody else has got iodine based on these pure
[59:28.440 --> 59:32.600]  crystals ladies and gentlemen this is innovating and the best part is it helps

[59:50.240 --> 01:00:05.960]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network big brother
[01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:13.240]  mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's
[01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:23.240]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:32.960]  I haven't even gotten into a ton of the news I've mainly just been talking about
[01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:38.800]  the state of humanity that every metric shows is degenerating now you do have
[01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:42.680]  highly educated informed people that are aware of what's going on that
[01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:47.840]  capitalize off of all this and their attitude is just continue on like that
[01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:51.520]  because there's nothing you can do for the unwashed masses they've always been
[01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:58.560]  slaves they'll always be slaves but I've studied renaissance I've studied
[01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:06.360]  really dynamic civilization periods and it's when the ruling class but also when
[01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:11.720]  the substratum beneath them decides to actually lift up humanity and empower
[01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:17.400]  humanity but also make humanity be be based on chivalry and on what you
[01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:22.160]  actually produce so so they don't allow monopolies of the elite and they don't
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:26.400]  allow gang mentality in the general public as well and by not allow it they
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:33.560]  lead against it and then freedom is so much better it then becomes dominant and
[01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:38.400]  then you have a golden era then the grandkids and great-grandkids become
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:43.360]  decadent slobs and the whole cycle begins the economy becomes based on fraud and
[01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:49.680]  conquest not on innovation not on art not on justice and you go through the
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:56.600]  cycle again and I've studied history the the decadent cycle we're going into just
[01:01:56.600 --> 01:02:01.280]  freaks me out I mean it's so horrible
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:07.880]  that the military is openly training to kill Americans in mass and put people in
[01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:14.000]  emergency FEMA camps and take over the infrastructure and arrest any political
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:18.960]  opposition and they're already persecuting governors and filmmakers and
[01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:26.480]  tea party and in all the manuals it's for good Americans I mean the system needs
[01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:31.760]  to sell itself though so it's selling itself on a bunch of you know gangster
[01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:36.240]  wannabe robbers taking advantage of the demonstrations and it's just all a
[01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:41.400]  psi-op it's all two plus two equals four and I see comments on info wars calm a
[01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:46.440]  minority of them and on YouTube going I wonder if he's right you know I wonder
[01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:51.560]  if if it's what he's saying I mean give me a break the globalist of all written
[01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:57.720]  books it's all admitted the Rand corporation all of it do you understand
[01:02:57.720 --> 01:03:05.800]  this is not my opinion can you get that through your head now we got the footage
[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:11.160]  we shot at their military training base with her trying to take on veterans
[01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:17.800]  black people churches I mean it's just the whole economy is being geared
[01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:23.320]  towards a cannibalistic predatory collapse scenario I'm trying to stop a
[01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:28.600]  collapse they tell the police that the police state's being put in to stop a
[01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:33.200]  collapse but it's a designed ordered collapse we're gonna go to break and
[01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:40.360]  come back and go to mad wet Brent Henry Elijah Bella and others I'm gonna go
[01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:44.880]  right to you when we come back as quickly as I can before the reporters come
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:53.240]  on it's just we see the slow sinking into enslavement and I don't want to just
[01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:58.560]  have the give-up attitude of you know just try to make some money and leave
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:05.240]  the country and run to some globalist or a doubt or or fortress country some
[01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:11.920]  safe harbor keep because I've looked at this historically and from all the
[01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:18.880]  angles we will not get out of this agenda 21 exterminist plan that is like
[01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:29.680]  something out of the mind of a 500 IQ space alien I'm pretty smart and I can
[01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:36.040]  barely even grasp it looking at the system and studying it for 20 years much
[01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:39.800]  less articulate let me just tell people something the New World Order is a
[01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:45.720]  liquid enslavement it is total death but before it destroys you it turns you
[01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:53.160]  into a jibbering mindless moron TV ad whose soul has been destroyed they don't
[01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:58.760]  even suck your soul they just from birth hammer the hell out of it so it's gone

[01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:13.600]  I'll be honest this doesn't happen but maybe once a month twice a month when I
[01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:20.280]  come in and start doing the radio show and I'm so upset about what's happening
[01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:29.960]  in the world that I physically get angry and just a really nasty mood and I
[01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:33.680]  feel like that right now and I was kind of psychoanalyzing myself during the
[01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:39.360]  break and I'm going to your calls and I know why I'm upset it's because I'm not
[01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:48.200]  upset enough and I've become acclimated and accepting of just
[01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:55.000]  incredibly outrageous spectacles like the police not arresting thugs that are
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:59.080]  still looting but arresting peaceful reporters that are polite and have done
[01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:08.840]  nothing wrong I am not upset about the bombshell army document that's public
[01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:13.240]  and admitted info wars dot com prison planet dot com left hand column drugs
[01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:20.600]  report dot com army preparing to use a legal force against unarmed civilians
[01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:31.680]  during full-scale riots in the US and what am I getting at I'm upset that I
[01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:37.720]  caught myself already being so aware of this that now that it's public I'm not
[01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:44.320]  even on air properly reading the quotes going over the document deciphering it
[01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:51.760]  all it's in clear black and white shoot unarmed peaceful demonstrators as a
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:57.960]  deterrent to protesting where did the First Amendment go it's so over the top
[01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:02.640]  we knew the training was going on we've got a video with three and a half million
[01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:10.200]  views from the nightly news last year showing an army manual where they
[01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:14.160]  prepare to shoot demonstrators and prepare to put Americans in camps
[01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:20.760]  during gun confiscation this is now saying shoot unarmed people period and
[01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:30.360]  we're to shoot them to kill people it is over the top it is such a big deal and
[01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:35.200]  then I realized what am I doing still in this country I'm not saying I'm gonna
[01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:41.760]  leave it's just my instinct my gut is get out of here I feel physically guilty
[01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:48.000]  at an animal level for not getting my children and my family and leaving this
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:54.080]  country but I intellectually and spiritually know I need to stay here to
[01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:57.520]  fight this that's my job that's my destiny that's your job that's your
[01:10:57.520 --> 01:11:08.440]  destiny many of you out there but I also then feel nauseous nauseous as a
[01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:13.560]  primitive man not going out and confronting the system the politicians
[01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:19.840]  and saying knock it off stop the police state stop the globalist takeover see
[01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:23.240]  all this rioting and stuff is meant to sell all the governors and people on
[01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:27.680]  allowing the federalization and the armored vehicles and the microphones and
[01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:33.160]  the police state training and the surveillance this is the designed end of
[01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:42.680]  our country with this infrastructure being set up to attack the bedrock of the
[01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:47.720]  nation returning veterans gun owners Christians conservatives libertarians
[01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:56.320]  constitutionalist Ron Paul supporters Alex Jones world net daily you know all
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:12:02.440]  the groups Matt drudge these are the groups the enemy wants to get okay so at
[01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:06.520]  a primitive level I know I'm the target I know they want a civil war with the
[01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:11.120]  police I don't have anything against the police I want to wake them up I want to
[01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:15.440]  stop it I don't want it to happen do people understand how real this is do
[01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:19.760]  people understand that's why I get so upset is because I want to yell and
[01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:24.880]  scream and then I try to intellectually cover all this but at a certain point man
[01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:31.160]  this ain't intellectual anymore the globalists have robbed everything
[01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:34.400]  trillions and trillions and trillions they've set us up to collapse they're
[01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:37.960]  shutting off our power plants they're shutting off everything well bringing in
[01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:42.160]  workers that can't even work to shut down the welfare system to collapse
[01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:47.240]  everything because the globalists have said they want to collapse it's called
[01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:52.360]  agenda 21 an organized global incremental collapse and only their
[01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:57.520]  high-tech governmental and corporate and super rich Elysium systems and I don't
[01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:02.320]  mean that from the movie the elites describe it as breakaway civilization
[01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:08.560]  and as Elysium in some of their papers look it up Elysium just means the Golden
[01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:14.240]  Fields of mortals that serve the gods well and so they're allowed to basically
[01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:19.400]  have life extension and live in a utopia and that's what the elite shell the
[01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:24.040]  professors and the technocrats and the people making the airborne Ebola and the
[01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:29.880]  eugenicists is that they will cleanse the earth of the ugly massive people they
[01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:34.240]  tell them 90 percent it's more like 99.9 and that they will then bring in a
[01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:38.520]  world government and that those that serve the system properly will then be
[01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:42.680]  able to merge with the machines and live forever let me give you a message
[01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:47.960]  you're not going to be given all of this if you serve the system the only way
[01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:52.000]  we have a shot at what the eye has not seen the ear is not heard that God has
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:58.120]  in store for us while we're alive is being honorable good people I said I'd
[01:13:58.120 --> 01:14:01.880]  take your calls and I'm ranting I want to play a few of these clips we haven't
[01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:08.000]  gotten to yet for TV and radio listeners let's play Joe Biggs our reporter
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:11.840]  getting a question in during the press conference dealing with martial law and
[01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:15.720]  being ignored by the state police captain running the press conference here
[01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:45.520]  it is and again that's the Ferguson captain is also another state
[01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:50.800]  police guy that uniforms are very similar that show of a television set so
[01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:54.520]  the audio is not the best somebody uploaded that on YouTube we've got
[01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:59.520]  clips also Marcos Morales trying to cover things and the police coming up

[01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:26.440]  demonstrators that are violent now being pelted with rocks by them and that's
[01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:29.440]  been happening to our reporters as well they've been getting yelled at and
[01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:33.120]  screamed at and things have been thrown at them the police have been attacking
[01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:36.760]  them and it's just a it's just a bunch of dumbed-down people across the board

[01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:22.160]  telling me this is a civil rights movement it's just not about Mike Brown
[01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:26.320]  it's about all people I am so tired of entitled
[01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:32.840]  thugs just randomly yelling at everyone and coming over and going why why are
[01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:37.480]  you racist that's just some way to like you're guilty I'm your boss do what I

[01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:55.800]  actually indigent shut up racist it's it's it's it's like a Swiss Army knife
[01:16:55.800 --> 01:17:01.240]  for people that aren't intellectual are informed it's just a one-size-fits-all
[01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:08.960]  cop-out mad wit in Minnesota or is it Missouri I think we need to get a bigger
[01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:13.560]  screen in here I just can't read this tiny print mad wit go ahead from
[01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:20.320]  Michigan you're on the air the name is a moniker for radio programs though okay
[01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:24.000]  that's fine sir go ahead you're on the air worldwide thank you for calling in
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:28.600]  today yeah you're welcome I think you're right we are being distracted but I
[01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:32.320]  think the thing we're being distracted from people aren't really considering and
[01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:38.680]  I got two examples 100 years ago they brought in a federal reserve and in
[01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:43.240]  1914 when Congress reconvene they let it stand and it stood for 100 years by
[01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:47.320]  definition that's treason the other one is the bill of rights the bill of rights
[01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:52.720]  isn't our rights from the government it's our rights from God it's a contract
[01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:56.400]  with the government that says the government can't make any laws and they
[01:17:56.400 --> 01:18:01.240]  broke that contract and an oath if you look in black law dictionary you'll see
[01:18:01.240 --> 01:18:05.120]  that that's treason so what we've got is a hundred years of treason between
[01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:09.960]  Democrats and Republicans in order to nullify the contract that we have and
[01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:15.120]  all the different treaties whether it's data NAFTA or whether it's a gender 21
[01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:19.400]  that's right thing we have to do is hold our our Democrats and Republicans
[01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:23.840]  accountable and the people that have to do that aren't the general public it's
[01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:27.560]  all those people that swore the oath it's sheriffs it's law enforcement it's
[01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:32.480]  military those people swore the oath I didn't swear the oath you didn't swear
[01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:36.320]  the oath it's frustrating that we keep getting distracted by all these issues
[01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:41.040]  whether it's war economy whether it's medicine whether it's food it's all
[01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:46.560]  legislated by Democrats and Republicans ultimately we have to take the government
[01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:51.160]  back the people that are in there need to be arrested tried if they're found
[01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:55.480]  guilty they need to be hung it's treason that's all it is it's just a crime
[01:18:55.480 --> 01:19:00.360]  being perpetrated by Democrats and Republicans it's a hundred years old
[01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:04.560]  we've been getting looted I mean when they took our money they stole the value
[01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:09.640]  of our labor that stood through every single time somebody swore the oath and
[01:19:09.640 --> 01:19:14.960]  they're all Democrats and Republicans and if you want to change the policies the
[01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:17.400]  first thing you got to do is you got to root all these devils out of the
[01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:20.960]  government well you're one of the best callers we've had in a long time and
[01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:25.560]  you've crystallized everything we have been living under a financial coup for
[01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:32.000]  100 plus years 100 years and eight months we are going into a deeper
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:36.440]  tyranny as the criminal ruling class tries to submit their hold over society
[01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:41.920]  and shut down their final economic competition and we are under high tech
[01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:45.640]  social engineering and that's why it's so sophisticated is because they've been
[01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:49.520]  honing this global system of control to the British Empire for hundreds of
[01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:55.800]  years and are deploying it successfully against us how do you challenge
[01:19:55.800 --> 01:19:59.240]  something like that I'm gonna come back to you mad with we're gonna go to others

[01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:25.400]  then I want to look at document Army preparing to use lethal force against
[01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:30.400]  unarmed civilians that's a quote in the document during full-scale riots in the
[01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:35.600]  US see they've got to be over the top they've got to give manuals to the riot
[01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:42.000]  police and the riot troops the National Guard and the Army here's how you shoot
[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:46.360]  unarmed people and then it's just given to you like here's how you kidnap kids
[01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:54.160]  out of the back of school yards here's how you deal methamphetamine you wonder
[01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:58.400]  how they did it in Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia shooting unarmed people they
[01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:01.560]  just give the order and act like it's no big deal and once it starts peer
[01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:08.560]  pressure they'll do it by the way I saw comments on my special report from the
[01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:12.040]  nightly news last night because I mentioned that the military has been
[01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:17.040]  training for at least five years to mow down masses of unarmed crowds and some
[01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:20.520]  people complained about it and said this is a war crime they're training for so
[01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:25.600]  they went oh we'll put green paint on their faces and call it zombie killing
[01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:31.360]  and I mentioned that and I saw someone comment that I was lying and you know
[01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:36.400]  what I think that's over the top so I agree it sounds like it's not true guys
[01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:42.080]  pull me the AP Reuters it was also in the LA Times Marines trained to kill
[01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:46.840]  zombies and it shows people in John Deere caps and you know farmer outfits
[01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:51.760]  dressed like zombies being mowed down by the Marines in official drills and they
[01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:54.480]  go oh isn't it cute the Marines and Army are training everywhere to kill
[01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:59.000]  zombies no they're training to mow down masses of people and dehumanizing them
[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:04.160]  our name won't be zipper head or you know the other racist terms they had for
[01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:10.200]  Asians in Vietnam it'll be zombies that's what we're called and that's what
[01:26:10.200 --> 01:26:14.160]  the welfare crowds pretty much lack like about a week after the welfare checks
[01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:20.840]  don't work there is AP Marines police prep for mock zombie invasion okay I
[01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:24.960]  didn't make it up do you understand me I'm sick of everybody out there being a
[01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:29.000]  denial I'm sick of people making up these you know saying I'm making up stuff
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:34.120]  about these army documents I'm not making any of this up we're run by a bunch of
[01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:39.400]  eugenicists bankers that want to implode everything and they created
[01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:44.160]  purposely these giant welfare masses and they weaponized music through Sumner
[01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:51.360]  Redstone on purpose and MTV to literally turn the inner-city population into what
[01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:57.600]  they now are okay and they've turned all the other population the public is a
[01:26:57.600 --> 01:27:05.640]  mess a bunch of dumbed-down idiots who you can't even communicate with it's
[01:27:05.640 --> 01:27:10.880]  it's it's 1984 in shock reduce the language down to where people don't
[01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:16.880]  even know what 2 plus 2 equals anymore it's a joke mad wit finish up then I'm
[01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:21.000]  gonna go to Brent and others go ahead go ahead yeah I wanted to comment on what
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:25.400]  you said there's a big thing out there where people are losing their IQs and
[01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:28.760]  yeah people are getting dumber and they're being socialized but I'd say
[01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:32.080]  it's not here's the deal just because they're dumb slobs doesn't give them a
[01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:37.240]  right to vote to make me a slave go ahead problem I think what the problem is
[01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:42.760]  it's emotional it's character they're so bombarded by everything that they can't
[01:27:42.760 --> 01:27:46.160]  possibly come to terms with the with the base group you know what's really
[01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:50.880]  occurring we know we've got a problem with treason with our government we
[01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:54.720]  don't need to attack every policy and try and work our way back we need to go
[01:27:54.720 --> 01:27:57.880]  right to the base where these people are responsible they're supposed to be
[01:27:57.880 --> 01:28:01.880]  honorable they're supposed to be honest they swear an oath that oath is binding
[01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:05.680]  when you're in the military you swear that oath you know you could die defending
[01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:09.600]  your country and it's the same thing for the Senate they have the responsibility
[01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:13.080]  it's the same thing for the house for the executive for the federal judicial
[01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:17.120]  they swear that oath they have the obligation they're held in high esteem
[01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:20.560]  they're given advantages they're given the opportunity to have positions of
[01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:26.240]  authority but that comes with a price and they've all violated their oath we
[01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:29.440]  don't need to worry about individual issues you know there's a theory in
[01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:33.360]  physics called conservation of energy totally proves the government and the
[01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:37.400]  media is complicit in 9-11 but nobody talks about a physical law because
[01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:42.120]  that's the end there's no conspiracy theory there's just physical law and
[01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:45.840]  now we've got the same thing we're dealing with conservation of energy in
[01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:50.880]  terms of social system yeah well you're talking about building seven absolutely
[01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:55.200]  fell faster than a bowling ball falls and they forced underwriting
[01:28:55.200 --> 01:28:58.920]  laboratories and the federal government had to admit architects and engineers
[01:28:58.920 --> 01:29:05.960]  for 9-11 truth was correct it did fall at freefall I mean it basically and again
[01:29:05.960 --> 01:29:10.160]  at some points faster than freefall because they were blowing the floors out
[01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:15.600]  faster than it could even fall so it fell at freefall and for one second when
[01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:19.600]  they blow up a bunch of floors at one time faster than freefall because it was
[01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:26.480]  just being blown out I mean I mean this is unbelievable and it's I hear you a

[01:33:10.440 --> 01:33:19.440]  network so here's the deal we're under social engineering by technocrats that
[01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:24.400]  have a scientific plan to overtake humanity and basically engineered us
[01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:29.320]  into a suboid servant species I don't know that plan will be implemented fully
[01:33:29.320 --> 01:33:33.160]  but they've gotten a lot of it done they are training the military for the
[01:33:33.160 --> 01:33:37.520]  collapse of the US by design to reorganize it into a totally fascist
[01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:43.120]  dictatorship micromanaging every fastest of your lives with a socialist
[01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:48.560]  operating system using communist tactics and now the army is preparing to use
[01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:53.920]  lethal force against unarmed civilians close quote during full-scale riots in
[01:33:53.920 --> 01:34:00.040]  US close quote and describe sniper response to the unarmed civilians and
[01:34:00.040 --> 01:34:05.600]  how they will shoot unarmed civilians during crowd control operations to
[01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:09.440]  psychologically terrorize the crowd and make them go away they say they will
[01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:13.440]  shoot them of course there's a lot of big problems with this is what the Nazis
[01:34:13.440 --> 01:34:19.000]  did what the Soviets did what the Romans did this is what bad guys do and then
[01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:24.600]  of course it means then the rules of engagement turn about fair play it means
[01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:28.120]  people will start shooting back and then a civil war starts so they're being
[01:34:28.120 --> 01:34:34.640]  given orders that the Nazis wouldn't put on paper the Nazis wouldn't put stuff
[01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:40.280]  like was in the Patriot Act on paper they just did it and I'm not comparing
[01:34:40.280 --> 01:34:45.120]  our military to Nazis this is the orders that are going out this is the
[01:34:45.120 --> 01:34:50.680]  training our military is freaking out over this and they're freaking out over
[01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:55.680]  domestic psyops they're freaking out about all of it
[01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:03.720]  this is unbelievable and if we don't make a big deal out of it and have a
[01:35:03.720 --> 01:35:07.680]  debate about it and say no it will then become the official policy just like the
[01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:11.960]  NSA I've been trying for 18 years to get people to admit the NSA was spying on
[01:35:11.960 --> 01:35:15.840]  everything I told you how they were tracking you with the eyewitnesses with
[01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:22.080]  all the reports with the whistleblowers it all came out to be accurate every bit
[01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:24.160]  of it
[01:35:27.880 --> 01:35:33.320]  and now it's just okay we found everything you do all new appliances or
[01:35:33.320 --> 01:35:38.280]  wireless spying on you smart meters your phones yes Google watches and listens to
[01:35:38.280 --> 01:35:42.480]  you what are you gonna do about it it's ubiquitous we have now been put into the
[01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:48.040]  artificial environment we have adapted they have used our adaptability to to
[01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:53.480]  they use our adaptability against us and I was told that by a top globalist
[01:35:53.480 --> 01:35:58.000]  off record there's the headline from William Benny a month ago in the London
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:01.760]  Guardian he was on our shows of the same thing number four at the NSA the ultimate
[01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:06.880]  goal of the NSA is total population control at least 80% of all audio calls
[01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:11.280]  and not just metadata are recorded and stored in US says whistleblower William
[01:36:11.280 --> 01:36:17.720]  Benny that's a totalitarian mentality folks they were putting microphones up
[01:36:17.720 --> 01:36:23.600]  hidden inside streetlights in 1998 nationwide they just got around to
[01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:28.960]  telling you about it this year Austin Texas Chicago Illinois Los Angeles

[01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:05.160]  brother I'm not in a good mood here yeah I hear you man I wanted to speak on the
[01:39:05.160 --> 01:39:08.960]  race war but I also like to touch on an important issue I believe right now you
[01:39:08.960 --> 01:39:12.920]  know I think this is all tied in and basically what we're staying with this
[01:39:12.920 --> 01:39:17.800]  rapid demise and you know policy after policy and action after action being
[01:39:17.800 --> 01:39:23.320]  orchestrated against the American people is basically an administration that is
[01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:28.400]  just throwing crap against the wall to see what will stick you know history is
[01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:34.840]  written by the winners and I guarantee you Soros Obama the Clintons Bernanke's
[01:39:34.840 --> 01:39:38.720]  all these people that are involved with the policies that are destroying
[01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:43.320]  America financially they don't want to go down in history you know we still
[01:39:43.320 --> 01:39:48.440]  speak of Romans from thousands of years ago at battles that they fought
[01:39:48.440 --> 01:39:53.680]  people's names the names of soldiers and emperors in America makes Rome look
[01:39:53.680 --> 01:39:59.200]  tiny in comparison as far as our our military might in our world politics and
[01:39:59.200 --> 01:40:04.360]  our influence and I know these people do not want their names going down in
[01:40:04.360 --> 01:40:09.000]  history thousands of years from now you know Bernanke being spoken about how
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:12.880]  his policies collapse the greatest empire on the face of the earth well
[01:40:12.880 --> 01:40:16.480]  and but I mean you say it's our empire and I do that too like why are we in Iraq
[01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:20.520]  why are we we're not doing anything we supply the money we supply the
[01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:26.040]  engineers our grandfathers and fathers built the
[01:40:26.040 --> 01:40:29.640]  technocracy we're in they thought they were building a technocracy to beat
[01:40:29.640 --> 01:40:34.280]  communism but the truth was the tech the technocrats had built the communism to
[01:40:34.280 --> 01:40:38.920]  be the threat to build up the police state here and then again the globalist
[01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:42.800]  have all written books from Brzezinski to curl quickly admitting that that's not
[01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:48.280]  my opinion we've got Bilderberg documents from the 1960s where they were
[01:40:48.280 --> 01:40:51.360]  meeting with all the labor union heads and the big bankers and it's all
[01:40:51.360 --> 01:40:57.720]  admitted you know we've been smuggled dead US senators notes hundreds of pages
[01:40:57.720 --> 01:41:02.840]  of it that we published just how they run the whole deal it's official in
[01:41:02.840 --> 01:41:10.360]  America a fluence equals influence a new study shows policy caters to the
[01:41:10.360 --> 01:41:15.960]  desires of wealthy Americans really oh my gosh US News and World Report my gosh
[01:41:15.960 --> 01:41:20.560]  next they're gonna tell me the sky's blue but here's the problem we don't have
[01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:23.640]  a virtuous elite
[01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:32.080]  I hear you Alex and if I may I'd like to touch on the race war issue as well the
[01:41:32.080 --> 01:41:39.600]  what the coming race war what I believe is an orchestrated color war basically
[01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:44.200]  you know one thing that you've taught in us info warriors you know you're not
[01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:48.160]  just out here waking up people Alex but you're teaching us how to do better
[01:41:48.160 --> 01:41:52.840]  research while we are awake and so there's more to it than what you give
[01:41:52.840 --> 01:41:57.360]  yourself credit for but what I see is you know when whenever the border was
[01:41:57.360 --> 01:42:02.040]  collapsed I started calling that there was gonna be a race war to my co-workers
[01:42:02.040 --> 01:42:07.320]  and basically everybody I had ran into because what the way I look at it is if
[01:42:07.320 --> 01:42:12.560]  you're bringing in ms-13 gang members and everybody knows the atrocities that
[01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:17.040]  they commit in Central America there's no debating that there's only two things
[01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:20.600]  that these people are good for one is going to be drug-running and the other
[01:42:20.600 --> 01:42:27.080]  is going to be murder and what I see happening is you know from 2001 on
[01:42:27.080 --> 01:42:32.120]  word we've heard this whole terror agenda and how we need to be terrorized and
[01:42:32.120 --> 01:42:37.520]  it's not working anymore and they need to step up the terror level game another
[01:42:37.520 --> 01:42:42.040]  notch for people to be subordinate to them and I think what we're going to
[01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:46.920]  see is we're going to hear about 40 bodies in Austin Texas along the side of
[01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:52.040]  the road with their heads cut off if you watch programming on ms-13 by the
[01:42:52.040 --> 01:42:56.800]  mainstream organizations that cover the programming you'll notice how they
[01:42:56.800 --> 01:43:01.680]  throw in little nuggets of information like oh yes the ms-13 gang members are
[01:43:01.680 --> 01:43:06.160]  roofers or they pour concrete or they do this insinuating that these are the
[01:43:06.160 --> 01:43:10.200]  people that you work with these are the people that are by your side every
[01:43:10.200 --> 01:43:14.800]  single day and you just don't know it so I look for the one of the next attacks
[01:43:14.800 --> 01:43:22.640]  to be ms-13 we know we could look at Central America and see the atrocities
[01:43:22.640 --> 01:43:26.600]  they've committed there and I basically look for that to come to America and in
[01:43:26.600 --> 01:43:31.680]  that will bring up the terror level game and then it'll be no longer you know an
[01:43:31.680 --> 01:43:35.960]  Arab person that somebody's looking for you know that they want to have an
[01:43:35.960 --> 01:43:40.320]  underlying racism or any kind of personal issue about it's gonna go to the guy
[01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:45.120]  that you know you eat lunch with every single day not knowing if him or his
[01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:50.400]  family is ms-13 that'll bring terror into where they could orchestrate their
[01:43:50.400 --> 01:43:57.120]  plan the way that I see it unfold them I hear you I appreciate your call I mean
[01:43:57.120 --> 01:43:59.640]  that's what they're doing they're opening the borders letting the crime in
[01:43:59.640 --> 01:44:08.880]  info wars comm article Ferguson protester lofts ISIS sign we have the
[01:44:08.880 --> 01:44:13.200]  video of that you can punch up my computer you can show TV viewers what
[01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:20.920]  I'm talking about but this is the type of garbage that we're dealing with you
[01:44:20.920 --> 01:44:25.000]  got ISIS signs in front of the White House but the TSA is checking baby
[01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:32.720]  diapers while our government gives heat-seeking missiles to al-qaeda it's
[01:44:32.720 --> 01:44:38.840]  all the destabilization program to then bring in the police state that's going
[01:44:38.840 --> 01:44:43.320]  to be pointed at producing Americans the final enemy of the globalist people
[01:44:43.320 --> 01:44:47.040]  that have not succumbed to their brainwashing and their weakness and
[01:44:47.040 --> 01:44:52.040]  they're everyone just checking their Facebook's all day or watching MTV and
[01:44:52.040 --> 01:45:00.680]  then or the Kardashians just all the adult childlike people just everywhere
[01:45:00.680 --> 01:45:06.240]  bubbling around mindlessly the whole system is just there to just wreck the
[01:45:06.240 --> 01:45:11.520]  human mind it's absolutely an abomination we're gonna go to Henry and
[01:45:11.520 --> 01:45:19.240]  Bella and Terry and others we've got Joe Biggs and Marcos Morales as well as
[01:45:19.240 --> 01:45:25.800]  Mikhail Phelan and of course Kit Daniels there doing a great job honing in
[01:45:25.800 --> 01:45:30.960]  investigating where the provocateurs are who's behind the mall off cocktails who's
[01:45:30.960 --> 01:45:35.840]  making the threats are the police involved we know there's a federal
[01:45:35.840 --> 01:45:40.240]  command center there and 50 FBI agents running the show and we know more
[01:45:40.240 --> 01:45:43.240]  reporters have been arrested we know the demonstrators some of them have been
[01:45:43.240 --> 01:45:50.040]  attacking CNN reporters and others MSNBC reporters Joe Biggs here to give us a
[01:45:50.040 --> 01:45:57.640]  breakdown on what he's witness for info wars.com Joe. Joe Biggs info wars.com
[01:45:57.640 --> 01:46:03.160]  St. Louis, Missouri last night it was very interesting we pulled up to the
[01:46:03.160 --> 01:46:07.240]  martial law command center and I wanted to see if I could get a glimpse of any
[01:46:07.240 --> 01:46:12.640]  that National Guard and one of the things that was a very apparent is still
[01:46:12.640 --> 01:46:19.440]  the police are 10 times more militarized than the military itself the National
[01:46:19.440 --> 01:46:25.040]  Guard had on ACUs which is at the Army Combat Uniform and a sidearm and that is
[01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:31.440]  it no riot shields no full battle rattle no Kevlar helmets no batons no sniper
[01:46:31.440 --> 01:46:37.560]  rifles no M4s nothing like that at all whatsoever they were just sitting there
[01:46:37.560 --> 01:46:46.160]  directing the flow of traffic in and out of the compound last night. What else have
[01:46:46.160 --> 01:46:52.320]  you witnessed? Well last night we did witness towards the end of the night
[01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:59.160]  around 11 or so someone tried to light the barbecue restaurant on fire it's
[01:46:59.160 --> 01:47:04.720]  directly to the right of the QT gas station a looter came in lit something
[01:47:04.720 --> 01:47:09.120]  on fire not mistaken he tried to throw something inside the building as well
[01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:15.960]  and light that place on fire maybe five minutes later a whole swarm of SWAT
[01:47:15.960 --> 01:47:20.720]  team members flew down the road got over there and put that out we heard gun
[01:47:20.720 --> 01:47:26.200]  shots soon thereafter and some of the rioters came and lit a section of the
[01:47:26.200 --> 01:47:30.320]  road or pretty much the entire road going back into the condominiums where
[01:47:30.320 --> 01:47:35.160]  Mike Brown was killed they lit that on fire they tried to keep the MRAPS and
[01:47:35.160 --> 01:47:38.920]  the police from driving down into that neighborhood and that is the area where
[01:47:38.920 --> 01:47:44.720]  people were shot at last night I didn't see any police officers fire any weapons
[01:47:44.720 --> 01:47:48.840]  they actually maintain muzzle awareness for the first time last night they had
[01:47:48.840 --> 01:47:52.120]  their weapons at the low ready they weren't pointed to anybody a lot of
[01:47:52.120 --> 01:47:55.080]  officers were out with nine mills in their hands they actually had them down
[01:47:55.080 --> 01:48:00.920]  beside their their wastes I'm sure that's due to the negative publicity
[01:48:00.920 --> 01:48:05.480]  they have been getting for their unnecessary roughness and just running
[01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:12.240]  around pointing weapons at people this is just incredible information Joe when
[01:48:12.240 --> 01:48:16.920]  no one has this info we need to get this in a text report kit Daniels or
[01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:22.920]  something we need to go to the scene talk to the witnesses and break down
[01:48:22.920 --> 01:48:27.720]  what's happening here this is this is very important well why is this not
[01:48:27.720 --> 01:48:31.640]  coming out in the press I have no idea I'm just telling you what I saw that's
[01:48:31.640 --> 01:48:38.440]  what Marcos and I saw right there we were there were press there around us so so
[01:48:38.440 --> 01:48:42.080]  if they're not saying anything about it they're just not they're just not doing
[01:48:42.080 --> 01:48:46.320]  their job whatsoever you know we sat around the side the MRAPS came in and
[01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:51.680]  the police were yelling on the radio if you're credentialed media you can be
[01:48:51.680 --> 01:48:56.080]  there just don't impede their job and stay on the side of the road so Marcos
[01:48:56.080 --> 01:49:00.080]  and I stayed off on the side of the road and we filmed them lighting stuff on
[01:49:00.080 --> 01:49:04.680]  fire and then running back into the neighborhood and doing that but most of
[01:49:04.680 --> 01:49:09.160]  these people weren't even from the area these are all outsiders who are just
[01:49:09.160 --> 01:49:12.880]  running around trying to start stuff I even spoke to the guy who owned that
[01:49:12.880 --> 01:49:17.120]  barbecue spot he ran over and he said you've been here for a while do I need
[01:49:17.120 --> 01:49:19.760]  to go over there should I be worried about anything and I was like I believe
[01:49:19.760 --> 01:49:23.600]  that the police had put it out I know they put out the one on the outside and
[01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:27.400]  I could hear them smash the rest of the glass to get in to put that one out I
[01:49:27.400 --> 01:49:30.480]  was like I think it's safe to say that your restaurant will still be there
[01:49:30.480 --> 01:49:34.880]  tomorrow but he was concerned he said he was tired of this he's tired of waking
[01:49:34.880 --> 01:49:39.080]  up and living in a war zone he just wants thing to get back to normal but
[01:49:39.080 --> 01:49:43.400]  as he's outsiders who are coming in and terrorizing the community and they've
[01:49:43.400 --> 01:49:51.040]  completely taken away from what the pro protest even was in the first place now
[01:49:51.040 --> 01:49:53.920]  we know some of the black Panthers the new black Panther Party's been calling
[01:49:53.920 --> 01:49:59.360]  for violence as best we can tell who are these outsiders well it's funny they
[01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:03.640]  they're calling for the violence but as soon as it gets around midnight you
[01:50:03.640 --> 01:50:07.720]  know what they're doing they're leaving I they're out there trying to hype people
[01:50:07.720 --> 01:50:12.320]  up they're telling them that you know the white man is suppressing them and
[01:50:12.320 --> 01:50:16.400]  that you know that we're bad blah blah blah blah getting everybody hyped up get
[01:50:16.400 --> 01:50:21.200]  these youngsters emotions running hot and then as soon as it's about to snap and
[01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:27.760]  go off those guys go home and they let these guys get all angry and agitated
[01:50:27.760 --> 01:50:32.120]  and run around start lighting Molotov cocktails start throwing bottles start
[01:50:32.120 --> 01:50:34.840]  throwing bricks and it gets out of the control and they just go home and watch
[01:50:34.840 --> 01:50:40.120]  it from TV you know last night the media was in all their designated areas and
[01:50:40.120 --> 01:50:43.400]  then once the shooting happened I can understand the police said hey we need
[01:50:43.400 --> 01:50:48.160]  you guys to get back because they're shooting at us fine got that so we
[01:50:48.160 --> 01:50:53.240]  moved back out of the way they're like you need to go into the the marked off

[01:54:48.800 --> 01:54:53.320]  the way the saw off will work is they'll be well you just must be against our
[01:54:53.320 --> 01:54:58.680]  military our military would never do that that's not what we're debating here
[01:54:58.680 --> 01:55:04.280]  that's the default brainwashing out there who wrote this why was it written
[01:55:04.280 --> 01:55:08.640]  by the Department of the Army at the Pentagon why is this the official
[01:55:08.640 --> 01:55:15.320]  crowd control manual being issued to everybody down to privates this is out
[01:55:15.320 --> 01:55:24.840]  rage us the point is answer the manual answer why this is being put out don't
[01:55:24.840 --> 01:55:30.600]  change the subject that's how the public mind works or military will never do
[01:55:30.600 --> 01:55:35.000]  that that'll never happen really will never have obama care will never have a
[01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.600]  president ruling by fiat with open borders will never have a private
[01:55:37.600 --> 01:55:40.360]  Federal Reserve looting us will never will never will never will never will
[01:55:40.360 --> 01:55:45.280]  never will never it will all come true because we don't get upset and say no to
[01:55:45.280 --> 01:55:50.240]  it and the country club class that thinks it's part of the elite is too busy
[01:55:50.240 --> 01:55:54.080]  driving their Cadillacs and Mercedes and playing tennis all day and playing
[01:55:54.080 --> 01:55:57.720]  golf all day and just hoping that everything doesn't implode around them
[01:55:57.720 --> 01:56:02.240]  we're going to lose everything because you're too busy clutching on to your
[01:56:02.240 --> 01:56:07.480]  tennis rackets and onto your golf clubs as if that's all that matters is getting
[01:56:07.480 --> 01:56:12.440]  your stroke right or taking your wife out to the theater to act like your high
[01:56:12.440 --> 01:56:16.640]  class you need to be politically involved right now this country is
[01:56:16.640 --> 01:56:26.360]  burning down politically around us Joe Biggs is there in Ferguson reporting on
[01:56:26.360 --> 01:56:29.720]  the provocaturing all the things we're seeing but do whatever you can but I'd
[01:56:29.720 --> 01:56:33.240]  go up and talk to those new black panther morons and just you know they
[01:56:33.240 --> 01:56:36.840]  act all powerful like they're in charge everyone stands around like it's a press
[01:56:36.840 --> 01:56:40.040]  conference because they're arrogant we need people to go up to them and say man
[01:56:40.040 --> 01:56:43.880]  why are you race-pating hey you answer the question you know it's well known
[01:56:43.880 --> 01:56:47.520]  you guys get Ford Foundation money to stir this up why don't you come out here
[01:56:47.520 --> 01:56:50.520]  tonight when stuff's getting burned down and actually witness what you're
[01:56:50.520 --> 01:56:56.120]  stirring up because it's outrageous how they're helping set up the police state
[01:56:56.120 --> 01:57:00.800]  against their own people it's a total Psyop and there's a some of the black of
[01:57:00.800 --> 01:57:04.920]  the new black pants people are Psyops and our actual operatives others are
[01:57:04.920 --> 01:57:09.560]  useful idiots what do you think's going on Joe Biggs I 100% agree with you
[01:57:09.560 --> 01:57:13.760]  Alex I mean that that's the only way it could possibly be I mean just when you
[01:57:13.760 --> 01:57:16.240]  get out there and you see them marching and you see them you know putting their
[01:57:16.240 --> 01:57:20.320]  fists up in the air and they're running around you know talking about you know
[01:57:20.320 --> 01:57:23.560]  their agenda and what they want to do and then you can see that the young the
[01:57:23.560 --> 01:57:27.720]  youth around them getting amped up and you know hopping up and down and pulling
[01:57:27.720 --> 01:57:31.480]  their mask over their face and you could see that you know that these guys are
[01:57:31.480 --> 01:57:36.160]  getting them agitated but then the night time I noticed I don't see one new
[01:57:36.160 --> 01:57:40.120]  black pant their suit out there I don't see the patches I don't see the buttons
[01:57:40.120 --> 01:57:43.880]  on anybody they're out there do out the day getting everybody amped up at the
[01:57:43.880 --> 01:57:50.040]  night time they are gone you know last night was pretty intense they started
[01:57:50.040 --> 01:57:54.880]  shooting gas at us and as they as they had us move back in the area because of
[01:57:54.880 --> 01:58:00.920]  our safety issues that they called it in the in the neighborhood once we got out
[01:58:00.920 --> 01:58:05.560]  of sight out of mind there were I was reading a Twitter and there were tweets
[01:58:05.560 --> 01:58:09.240]  from people living in that community saying that the police were going from
[01:58:09.240 --> 01:58:13.800]  house to house searching in there and there were also reports of you know
[01:58:13.800 --> 01:58:18.920]  people looters lighting garbage cans on fire out there in the area so I
[01:58:18.920 --> 01:58:22.760]  definitely plan on going back out there today and see what I can find in that
[01:58:22.760 --> 01:58:27.240]  neighborhood to confirm those reports so the reports are that the police are
[01:58:27.240 --> 01:58:30.880]  going inside people's houses without warrants that's what we heard last night
[01:58:30.880 --> 01:58:34.440]  from a few different people try to get some I wouldn't go find out yeah stay

[02:00:07.200 --> 02:00:14.560]  media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[02:00:14.560 --> 02:00:23.480]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[02:00:38.560 --> 02:00:43.680]  we're taking your phone calls coming up I want to get our guests moved to 20
[02:00:43.680 --> 02:00:46.520]  after the police state expert because I want to finish these calls that have
[02:00:46.520 --> 02:00:51.480]  been holding patiently I want to finish up with Joe Biggs Joe so much is
[02:00:51.480 --> 02:00:56.280]  happening you guys are doing a great job I just think it's important to not just
[02:00:56.280 --> 02:00:59.200]  report when you're here with me when you're doing these great live streams
[02:00:59.200 --> 02:01:04.200]  just keep reporting and getting the word out on all the things you've been
[02:01:04.200 --> 02:01:09.840]  witnessing and I think it's integral to go prove the provocaturing is going on
[02:01:09.840 --> 02:01:14.680]  we know it's already going on we've proved it some and then I think bring
[02:01:14.680 --> 02:01:18.920]  those videos to the police and try to confront them why aren't you going
[02:01:18.920 --> 02:01:25.680]  after the provocateurs because if people are running around calling for
[02:01:25.680 --> 02:01:33.120]  violence and stirring things up that's yelling fire in a theater and I
[02:01:33.120 --> 02:01:36.040]  understand the establishment wants there to be rioting and problems because then
[02:01:36.040 --> 02:01:40.760]  that gives them an excuse to have tanks and all you know these uniforms and the
[02:01:40.760 --> 02:01:46.760]  surveillance and all the rest of it Joe Biggs I was I was trying to ask multiple
[02:01:46.760 --> 02:01:51.320]  people last night what the sole purpose of the National Guard there what their
[02:01:51.320 --> 02:01:56.800]  duty was going to be in Ferguson none of the soldiers there the funny thing is
[02:01:56.800 --> 02:02:00.240]  is I would say about 90% of the National Guard soldiers I saw were a
[02:02:00.240 --> 02:02:03.560]  specialist in below says e-form below they're not even non-commissioned
[02:02:03.560 --> 02:02:08.440]  officers yet these guys had no idea what they were doing they're just a bunch of
[02:02:08.440 --> 02:02:12.760]  kids sitting around being told that they have to go stand out here and let you
[02:02:12.760 --> 02:02:16.040]  know move an orange cone back and forth you know and at the press conference
[02:02:16.040 --> 02:02:22.080]  last night I got a question and Marcos and Kit we all got questions in you
[02:02:22.080 --> 02:02:26.120]  could tell whenever we ask questions he just got this look on his face because
[02:02:26.120 --> 02:02:29.360]  they were real questions they weren't questions like is there going to be a
[02:02:29.360 --> 02:02:34.040]  curfew tomorrow you know how how are you guys doing overall you know with your
[02:02:34.040 --> 02:02:37.160]  health you know we were asking real questions like why our First Amendment
[02:02:37.160 --> 02:02:41.840]  rights being violated you know and then he went on to say that because there
[02:02:41.840 --> 02:02:44.960]  was a there was a threat there was a danger well you know what no one held a
[02:02:44.960 --> 02:02:48.440]  gun to his head and made him join the police force he should have known just
[02:02:48.440 --> 02:02:51.680]  like I did when I joined the military that there's a very good chance I could
[02:02:51.680 --> 02:02:55.920]  die just like I volunteered to come here to report on what's going on there's a
[02:02:55.920 --> 02:02:59.280]  good chance that I could get shot but I'm willing to take that chance to
[02:02:59.280 --> 02:03:03.040]  do my job so the American people and the world can see the truth of what's
[02:03:03.040 --> 02:03:06.880]  happening all he did was dance around stuff that come the entire press conference
[02:03:06.880 --> 02:03:11.840]  last night was BS he was just ducking and dodging real issues he had his whole
[02:03:11.840 --> 02:03:15.360]  little heartfelt script that he written up that took him about 10 minutes to read
[02:03:15.360 --> 02:03:20.000]  through where he almost tried to bring up tears it was just a complete it was a
[02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:24.520]  sign off where it's like a nation of lawyers and wannabe lawyers and pitch
[02:03:24.520 --> 02:03:30.600]  men and BSers and no one's being real that's why we're in so much trouble the
[02:03:30.600 --> 02:03:35.360]  crowd is you know degenerating and more and more thugs are showing up well he
[02:03:35.360 --> 02:03:39.080]  mentioned that he was upset with how the media was doing their job you know and
[02:03:39.080 --> 02:03:42.000]  I'm sitting here just like I'm standing right beside him I mean I'm on every
[02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:45.640]  channel you can think of and I'm sitting here like you know I would talk and I'd
[02:03:45.640 --> 02:03:50.760]  be like what do you mean we're doing our job we're reporting and he's saying that
[02:03:50.760 --> 02:03:54.640]  people were getting in the way or they don't need to be there negative well you
[02:03:54.640 --> 02:03:57.880]  guys are trying to move us out of the way so we can't see what's going on like
[02:03:57.880 --> 02:04:02.080]  be going into people's houses without an warrant going around they're whining oh
[02:04:02.080 --> 02:04:05.760]  why is the media being mean to us well why are you shooting reporters or rubber
[02:04:05.760 --> 02:04:11.440]  bullets on purpose and pointing guns at him and arresting him and McDonald's if
[02:04:11.440 --> 02:04:15.960]  you have nothing to hide then why are you worried about people filming they're
[02:04:15.960 --> 02:04:23.400]  scared they know that their tactics are completely screwed up they are the just
[02:04:23.400 --> 02:04:27.240]  and we're showing video to though the protesters being jerks you know I got to
[02:04:27.240 --> 02:04:30.840]  be honest Joe I said I'd probably go out there this week but I've got so much to
[02:04:30.840 --> 02:04:34.160]  run here at the office but I've been to all sorts of stuff like this before some
[02:04:34.160 --> 02:04:37.280]  of the trolls are like thoughts you're going you're scared you know what I am
[02:04:37.280 --> 02:04:41.880]  scared because if I went there and some cop pointed a gun at me for no reason I
[02:04:41.880 --> 02:04:45.160]  get mad and if some thug came up and slapped my camera I'd punch him in the
[02:04:45.160 --> 02:04:49.960]  face so I just want to say I commend you guys not hauling off and hitting anybody
[02:04:49.960 --> 02:04:54.120]  it was funny one of the police officer the right police officer goes in full

[02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:57.440]  force yeah we when we got in there last night we set up as quick as we could
[02:09:57.440 --> 02:10:00.500]  there were some demonstrators out there some protesters walking up and down the
[02:10:00.500 --> 02:10:06.320]  street that quickly dissipated that kind of went away and a mid-sized
[02:10:06.320 --> 02:10:10.840]  crowd kind of stayed at the the the police line right in front of the
[02:10:10.840 --> 02:10:14.360]  McDonald's now then back down the street about you know half of a quarter of a
[02:10:14.360 --> 02:10:19.200]  mile down that way there was another group of people in the QT parking lot
[02:10:19.200 --> 02:10:22.600]  there was a lot of police officers lined up and down the sides of the road and
[02:10:22.600 --> 02:10:27.240]  for some reason they all lined up and then shot down to the QT they formed a
[02:10:27.240 --> 02:10:31.000]  big line and sat there and then I could hear them over the loudspeakers anybody
[02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:35.280]  in the QT parking lot disperse anyone who doesn't do that is subject to arrest
[02:10:35.280 --> 02:10:39.280]  and or more they said that as part of the sentence again which they've only
[02:10:39.280 --> 02:10:45.480]  recently added to Saturday once we were told to move Marco stayed back and he
[02:10:45.480 --> 02:10:50.800]  continued filming I got back and I was trying to find Kit and Mikhail and I was
[02:10:50.800 --> 02:10:55.880]  filming from that area as they were finally setting up the blockade and I
[02:10:55.880 --> 02:10:59.120]  got on the radio we got some little walkie-talkies I'm like Marcos they are
[02:10:59.120 --> 02:11:02.480]  starting to arrest people and in front of me I'm I'm used to being there's a guy
[02:11:02.480 --> 02:11:06.680]  on the ground they're wrestling down and zip tying them up and I'm sitting
[02:11:06.680 --> 02:11:09.240]  there radio's like Marcos where you at they are arresting people they don't
[02:11:09.240 --> 02:11:12.680]  care who you are now at this point they are just in a bad mood they're just
[02:11:12.680 --> 02:11:16.360]  trying to arrest everybody Marcos is just walking up nonchalantly with his
[02:11:16.360 --> 02:11:20.240]  camera to the police line of the guys are just like really literally about to
[02:11:20.240 --> 02:11:23.080]  arrest them and he's pointing at the camera like you know hello this is an
[02:11:23.080 --> 02:11:27.600]  obvious I'm a journalist but that doesn't mean anything to these guys
[02:11:27.600 --> 02:11:31.480]  because they were ripping off press off their bulletproof vest off of one of the
[02:11:31.480 --> 02:11:34.880]  vice reporters last night they said this doesn't mean anything and ripped it off
[02:11:34.880 --> 02:11:38.880]  the chest and you know we're trying to throw the guy around and then in the
[02:11:38.880 --> 02:11:43.800]  press conference last night the captain Johnson said he's like how do you like
[02:11:43.800 --> 02:11:47.920]  there's so many people nowadays that claim to me media he's like obviously if
[02:11:47.920 --> 02:11:51.360]  I look at a guy he's got a $50,000 rig on his shoulder well then that
[02:11:51.360 --> 02:11:54.960]  automatically means that he's a journalist but nowadays and then he
[02:11:54.960 --> 02:11:58.960]  looked at me and he goes you got guys walking around with vest on holding an
[02:11:58.960 --> 02:12:02.520]  iPhone or something like that I don't know who they are you know that doesn't
[02:12:02.520 --> 02:12:06.960]  mean that you're a journalist so apparently having a $50,000 camera is
[02:12:06.960 --> 02:12:12.200]  Prescott intros to these guys so anyone else who doesn't have that giant rig on
[02:12:12.200 --> 02:12:16.560]  their shoulder is for fair game for these guys who arrest as far as he was
[02:12:16.560 --> 02:12:20.400]  concerned and for those that don't know those giant rigs are now being phased
[02:12:20.400 --> 02:12:27.360]  out even movie companies use the Canon cameras that we use they're like $10,000
[02:12:27.360 --> 02:12:35.320]  it's just asinine I mean CNN reporters do Skype iPhone videos but this is Diane
[02:12:35.320 --> 02:12:39.520]  Feinstein saying that they will decide who is press and who will get
[02:12:39.520 --> 02:12:44.200]  protection the talk radio doesn't get it that a citizen journalist don't get it
[02:12:44.200 --> 02:12:48.400]  the drudge report doesn't get it that info wars doesn't get it doesn't matter
[02:12:48.400 --> 02:12:52.400]  if we break major news stories every day it doesn't matter if we have 20 million
[02:12:52.400 --> 02:12:56.960]  listeners overall every week it doesn't matter if we have 800 million YouTube
[02:12:56.960 --> 02:13:01.400]  views now conservatively 400 something million on one channel it doesn't matter
[02:13:01.400 --> 02:13:06.560]  if we got three million Facebook followers it none of that matters it
[02:13:06.560 --> 02:13:11.280]  doesn't matter that I'm in two major Hollywood films it doesn't matter I've
[02:13:11.280 --> 02:13:17.680]  been a consultant to TV and movies it doesn't matter because they will decide
[02:13:17.680 --> 02:13:21.800]  well the truth is they're arresting CNN reporters they're arresting Washington
[02:13:21.800 --> 02:13:26.240]  Post reporters they're arresting Getty reporters they're arresting the truth is
[02:13:26.240 --> 02:13:31.640]  they're just playing games and it shows how they define things our government has
[02:13:31.640 --> 02:13:36.600]  never in a riot situation targeted reporters unless they were in an arrest
[02:13:36.600 --> 02:13:44.120]  situation in between the cops that is interfering with their duty it is not
[02:13:44.120 --> 02:13:49.600]  interfering with the duty to be 200 yards away this is asinine this is
[02:13:49.600 --> 02:13:54.000]  interfering with our First Amendment and it's crazy why do you think they're
[02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:58.640]  doing this is just the hubris because because it'd be one thing if they were
[02:13:58.640 --> 02:14:01.960]  going and arresting or you know even roughing up people burning down
[02:14:01.960 --> 02:14:06.480]  businesses that's arson that can kill people they would be cheered but instead
[02:14:06.480 --> 02:14:11.200]  they sit there and let them burn stuff down and then come over and attack the
[02:14:11.200 --> 02:14:16.440]  press why why do you think they're doing that they sent about seven or eight
[02:14:16.440 --> 02:14:21.080]  officers into the neighborhood where the shooting was and the fires meanwhile
[02:14:21.080 --> 02:14:25.920]  there were probably 50 or 60 police officers dealing with those pesky
[02:14:25.920 --> 02:14:30.040]  journalists trying to you know exercise their First Amendment rights Alex
[02:14:30.040 --> 02:14:35.400]  last night was discussing because I saw a complete and total collapse of the
[02:14:35.400 --> 02:14:39.400]  First Amendment they corralled us into the area they got us in the free speech
[02:14:39.400 --> 02:14:43.800]  zone the media area once we got there then they then came over the speakers
[02:14:43.800 --> 02:14:48.800]  and said now you have to all leave immediately and the police came out the
[02:14:48.800 --> 02:14:53.520]  right please force us out of the media area into our vehicles that may just go
[02:14:53.520 --> 02:14:57.200]  down a road and then I was like all right well I want to go back to the main
[02:14:57.200 --> 02:15:01.360]  media site at the martial law command center so I can find out what's going
[02:15:01.360 --> 02:15:04.800]  on while we're having our rights taken away from us and we're not being allowed
[02:15:04.800 --> 02:15:09.480]  to do our job so we pull out of that area after being forced out by the police
[02:15:09.480 --> 02:15:14.440]  and had to go on this 20 minute drive this run around around Ferguson because
[02:15:14.440 --> 02:15:17.760]  every time we go to a road the cops would be blocking off like oh no you have
[02:15:17.760 --> 02:15:21.120]  to go down the interstate go to the next exit and by the way the crew here is
[02:15:21.120 --> 02:15:24.440]  doing an incredible job as well I don't know how they're able to do it as you
[02:15:24.440 --> 02:15:29.320]  talk they go to the hours of video that you guys uploaded live and they are
[02:15:29.320 --> 02:15:34.040]  showing the police talking to you when you were talking to them they look so
[02:15:34.040 --> 02:15:41.680]  angry and hateful that you would dare even want to be a mile away from where
[02:15:41.680 --> 02:15:45.600]  stuff is going unbelievable yeah they're completely trying to keep us from doing
[02:15:45.600 --> 02:15:50.400]  our job meanwhile you know Captain Johnson's getting on TV badmouthing the
[02:15:50.400 --> 02:15:54.520]  media saying that we're not doing our job well he swore to an oath to uphold the
[02:15:54.520 --> 02:15:58.680]  Constitution and I want to say sir you're not doing your job at all
[02:15:58.680 --> 02:16:04.320]  whatsoever what you're doing is a disgrace to Americans and to the world
[02:16:04.320 --> 02:16:08.600]  out of control out of control out of control and just giving us his oop to
[02:16:08.600 --> 02:16:12.720]  you this run around around town just driving people were all over the place
[02:16:12.720 --> 02:16:16.320]  trap you mean there's never gonna be traffic at 2 o'clock in the morning and
[02:16:16.320 --> 02:16:19.680]  the only reason there was because they just kept redirecting people journalists
[02:16:19.680 --> 02:16:22.920]  all from every organization were trying to figure out what's going on and then
[02:16:22.920 --> 02:16:26.360]  when we got out there they held us out there until 2 30 in the morning because
[02:16:26.360 --> 02:16:29.640]  he was upset with how the media were doing their job then he came out with a
[02:16:29.640 --> 02:16:33.520]  bad attitude moving some of the microphones around and all that stuff
[02:16:33.520 --> 02:16:38.520]  very unprofessional it the whole thing is just a complete joke of what they're
[02:16:38.520 --> 02:16:43.600]  doing they're definitely hiding stuff and like I said the only way to get to
[02:16:43.600 --> 02:16:47.840]  the truth sometimes you got to skip and hop and climb over a few fences but
[02:16:47.840 --> 02:16:51.680]  that's the only way to do it because these guys are completely taking away to
[02:16:51.680 --> 02:16:55.240]  where we have to go to that extreme well this is how I hide in the woods exactly
[02:16:55.240 --> 02:17:01.600]  something this is how the Talitarianism works one guy does something wrong on
[02:17:01.600 --> 02:17:05.800]  the block everybody gets in trouble that's Nazi Germany that's Soviet Russia
[02:17:05.800 --> 02:17:10.480]  you get thugs from out of town tearing stuff up and as you said they've got
[02:17:10.480 --> 02:17:15.280]  more police to harass the media than they do to chase down the thugs that's a
[02:17:15.280 --> 02:17:19.000]  major news angle Joe that you witnessed that we need to get a report out with
[02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:24.280]  one of our writers about that that that that you witnessed sound like you said
[02:17:24.280 --> 02:17:29.080]  about five to one the police presence was for the media and not for the out of
[02:17:29.080 --> 02:17:33.000]  town looters I think that's a major evidence that they may be provocateurs
[02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:37.800]  working for the feds the feds have a history of doing that job yeah they were
[02:17:37.800 --> 02:17:41.960]  they were more concerned about us and they were about the fires about what
[02:17:41.960 --> 02:17:45.840]  was really going on out there their their attention seemed to be purely on us
[02:17:45.840 --> 02:17:52.200]  and being right there in that media area you know and one of the questions
[02:17:52.200 --> 02:17:58.280]  someone asked is is I think one of the late she goes she goes sir you said that
[02:17:58.280 --> 02:18:03.480]  the curfew was lifted and he goes yes she's like well there's no one on the
[02:18:03.480 --> 02:18:08.120]  streets after midnight you force everybody out of there isn't that in fact a
[02:18:08.120 --> 02:18:14.360]  curfew next question and he wouldn't even answer that all they do a duck and
[02:18:14.360 --> 02:18:18.600]  dodge real questions that's all they did it was a complete total sigh up to the
[02:18:18.600 --> 02:18:23.640]  tea I'm looking at video you guys shot of these National Guard people they look
[02:18:23.640 --> 02:18:28.840]  like kids yeah their kids are babies a lot of the one guy who has been filming
[02:18:28.840 --> 02:18:31.880]  out here all week with me that I've gotten to know he was an ex-marine and
[02:18:31.880 --> 02:18:34.760]  he just kept sitting down there on the ground he's like hey don't doesn't your
[02:18:34.760 --> 02:18:38.040]  mom know that you're out here did you get a permission slip for this you know
[02:18:38.040 --> 02:18:40.840]  don't you don't you need to be doing some kind of homework or something because
[02:18:40.840 --> 02:18:43.800]  they were just babies I mean the guys they didn't even know what they were
[02:18:43.800 --> 02:18:47.360]  doing out there I would ask them simple questions I'm like hey I used to be in
[02:18:47.360 --> 02:18:51.040]  the military I was like you know what do you guys where'd you guys come from oh
[02:18:51.040 --> 02:18:57.240]  and I was like well so who's your point of contact for the media I don't know
[02:18:57.240 --> 02:19:01.080]  who that is I was like well you all came together you came from the same unit why
[02:19:01.080 --> 02:19:04.920]  don't you know these simple questions well this is a ticking time bomb they're
[02:19:04.920 --> 02:19:09.320]  out there with Beretta sidearms on nine millimeters they have a run-in with any
[02:19:09.320 --> 02:19:13.200]  of these thugs or anybody this could turn into a shooting situation like this
[02:19:13.200 --> 02:19:17.120]  state and then all hell's gonna break loose exactly because they're gonna be
[02:19:17.120 --> 02:19:20.440]  very nervous they're not gonna know how to act under fire I asked anyone if they
[02:19:20.440 --> 02:19:25.440]  had ever been active duty before most of them just said no yeah when I asked if
[02:19:25.440 --> 02:19:29.600]  they'd ever been in combat most of them just shook their head no so these are
[02:19:29.600 --> 02:19:34.120]  kids who have never been in any kind of really life experience and they get put
[02:19:34.120 --> 02:19:37.960]  in this situation with a gun they get thrown in front of people actually
[02:19:37.960 --> 02:19:44.680]  intending to do harm to them and someone's gonna get shot it's death
[02:19:44.680 --> 02:19:49.120]  it's definitely a recipe for disaster in Ferguson now that the National Guard
[02:19:49.120 --> 02:19:54.360]  children are here I gotta say I saw the commanding officer he looked like he
[02:19:54.360 --> 02:19:58.400]  started shaving maybe last week I've never seen National Guard that looks
[02:19:58.400 --> 02:20:07.120]  this green yeah they are there fresh off the fresh out well Joe I want you to be
[02:20:07.120 --> 02:20:13.480]  careful I know heroics tonight just try to follow what they say even though it's
[02:20:13.480 --> 02:20:17.320]  unconstitutional and a bunch of baloney just the biggest thing I try to do is I
[02:20:17.320 --> 02:20:21.400]  try to listen to when I hear somebody say something really good and then I run
[02:20:21.400 --> 02:20:24.520]  over and like hey can you say that again real quick and then I try to catch it
[02:20:24.520 --> 02:20:28.240]  that way with the police you just got to be quiet and you've got to listen
[02:20:28.240 --> 02:20:31.920]  because they use her the radio is very low and you can pick on a lot of the
[02:20:31.920 --> 02:20:34.800]  radio chatter that they're doing their communication and you can hear them
[02:20:34.800 --> 02:20:40.560]  you know saying stuff that a little bit out there so what are you hurry I'm say
[02:20:40.560 --> 02:20:43.800]  what are you hurry I'm say well you can hear him you know saying hey we need to
[02:20:43.800 --> 02:20:47.280]  get these guys out of here and they're looking at us and then they run over to
[02:20:47.280 --> 02:20:50.360]  the media and then one minute the guy on the speaker saying hey if you're
[02:20:50.360 --> 02:20:53.560]  credentialed media you're fine and then all of a sudden you get some guys pull
[02:20:53.560 --> 02:20:57.960]  up in an SUV and jump out and they're like oh you can hear them whisper and
[02:20:57.960 --> 02:21:01.080]  then they're like no no no now you guys need to go and then they load up on that
[02:21:01.080 --> 02:21:05.280]  truck with the seven guys and then go into the town or into that side road so
[02:21:05.280 --> 02:21:09.920]  it's it's what the mainstream media doesn't do is pay attention to every
[02:21:09.920 --> 02:21:13.080]  little detail that's why it's good that we have the four people out here today
[02:21:13.080 --> 02:21:18.200]  that we can leave people in the the sheep pen the main the main stream media
[02:21:18.200 --> 02:21:23.280]  area so we can hear exactly and please tell the media and then they rated back
[02:21:23.280 --> 02:21:26.920]  to us saying hey this is just what they told us are you actually seeing that on
[02:21:26.920 --> 02:21:30.720]  the ground and then I go and say hey no that's definitely not happening or it
[02:21:30.720 --> 02:21:35.280]  is so we have a pretty good system set up now with information being sent back
[02:21:35.280 --> 02:21:40.160]  and forth well this is not a soap opera we're here following even though in the
[02:21:40.160 --> 02:21:44.240]  scheme of things it's been blown out of proportion we're analyzing messiah from
[02:21:44.240 --> 02:21:49.200]  every angle to try to educate and inform listeners and then viewers who
[02:21:49.200 --> 02:21:52.920]  aren't informed a lot of our listeners are more informed than we are but it's
[02:21:52.920 --> 02:21:58.560]  all part of a real media process of breaking down historically what's
[02:21:58.560 --> 02:22:02.840]  happening here but at the same time people are getting my punditry where I
[02:22:02.840 --> 02:22:06.880]  really do genuinely blow up on air flipping out over the fact and then I'm
[02:22:06.880 --> 02:22:09.440]  going to the phone calls and we're going to break I just kept the network break
[02:22:09.440 --> 02:22:17.400]  then we're gonna go to your calls but I realize I'm so upset Joe in closing you
[02:22:17.400 --> 02:22:22.280]  were leaving yesterday as this article broke the new Army training manual it's
[02:22:22.280 --> 02:22:29.240]  public where they said they will kill unarmed civilians during full-scale
[02:22:29.240 --> 02:22:37.160]  riots as a scyop how to wound or kill people to scare crowds away so they're
[02:22:37.160 --> 02:22:42.800]  now putting war crime stuff off the chart in documents to the point of when I
[02:22:42.800 --> 02:22:50.080]  read this document I start stuttering on air because it is such a horrific crisis
[02:22:50.080 --> 02:22:55.440]  to know that we've now moved to this point and that there's no media covering
[02:22:55.440 --> 02:23:00.120]  this drudge has been linked to this since yesterday so we know all the media
[02:23:00.120 --> 02:23:05.400]  radio TV print is seeing this we've got you know three four thousand comments on
[02:23:05.400 --> 02:23:10.040]  the article we can look on the metrics and see that about 800,000 people have
[02:23:10.040 --> 02:23:15.600]  read the article or visited it and there's no coverage of an official Army
[02:23:15.600 --> 02:23:22.320]  training manual saying the new policy is to kill unarmed Americans I mean this
[02:23:22.320 --> 02:23:27.840]  is over the top I mean the fact that we're using CS gas by militarized
[02:23:27.840 --> 02:23:33.400]  militarized police in America when NATO does not allow our military forces to use
[02:23:33.400 --> 02:23:38.280]  it on any enemy combatants is crazy in itself that lets you know of what
[02:23:38.280 --> 02:23:43.000]  they're trying to go to now here so it doesn't that doesn't I can believe
[02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:46.320]  every single bit of that I've also had a couple of my military buddies over the
[02:23:46.320 --> 02:23:50.840]  past day contact me and say hey I've actually seen that recently so that
[02:23:50.840 --> 02:23:57.360]  they're familiar with that no it's been issued it's officially approved for
[02:23:57.360 --> 02:24:03.520]  public release distribution is unlimited it was secret in April and they just
[02:24:03.520 --> 02:24:06.640]  decided to put it out last Friday and the funny thing is those when people see
[02:24:06.640 --> 02:24:10.080]  that they're still gonna deny it and it's right there and you can look it up
[02:24:10.080 --> 02:24:14.960]  you can go to a Army base and you can see it right there in black and white
[02:24:14.960 --> 02:24:20.960]  the mainstream media will go now that's not real that's not gonna happen that's
[02:24:20.960 --> 02:24:24.840]  right you could go to an Army base and go to their information office and they
[02:24:24.840 --> 02:24:28.560]  could show you an official book of this I would give it to you like they would
[02:24:28.560 --> 02:24:32.280]  one of those Gideon Bibles at a hotel I mean they're not even gonna like think
[02:24:32.280 --> 02:24:35.720]  twice about it oh yeah here here you go here's a here's a handbook on domestic
[02:24:35.720 --> 02:24:43.480]  terrorism against civilian jail here you go they're not gonna care I literally
[02:24:43.480 --> 02:24:48.960]  cannot talk at this point it's so over the top it's just they're training to
[02:24:48.960 --> 02:24:54.440]  mow innocent people down and again I'm not the people are so dumb now that it's
[02:24:54.440 --> 02:25:01.120]  gonna it's feasible people now are so dumb down from their their Facebook their
[02:25:01.120 --> 02:25:08.280]  TVs all this stuff reality TV just being lazy and not caring whatsoever that the
[02:25:08.280 --> 02:25:11.840]  government can literally come out with documents like this and put them in
[02:25:11.840 --> 02:25:16.640]  front of your face and wave it around and you the bulk of the population will
[02:25:16.640 --> 02:25:21.320]  sit there and go nah I've literally talked to people about stuff like this
[02:25:21.320 --> 02:25:26.640]  nah and show it to them now that's not real that's impossible this shows they're
[02:25:26.640 --> 02:25:30.520]  going to be light-handed for a while to sell the military on it because again
[02:25:30.520 --> 02:25:34.160]  we're not saying the military wants to do this we're not saying they're bad the
[02:25:34.160 --> 02:25:38.680]  media they do cover will spin it Alex says the army wants to learn men women
[02:25:38.680 --> 02:25:44.080]  and kids up and kill them no they put this on paper the issue is this is the
[02:25:44.080 --> 02:25:48.920]  official manual this is the policy so don't throw it onto the troops and say
[02:25:48.920 --> 02:25:53.080]  that I said they want to kill women and children or unarmed people we just want
[02:25:53.080 --> 02:25:57.800]  to know why they wrote it why is it why is the new policy yes exactly don't
[02:25:57.800 --> 02:26:02.360]  change the subject because I know how the Psyop works out there or military would
[02:26:02.360 --> 02:26:08.360]  never do that bull during a total collapse when there's 10,000 people
[02:26:08.360 --> 02:26:13.720]  coming up your rural road to loot your town I will be I'll be out there to
[02:26:13.720 --> 02:26:17.360]  defend my family but you think that's funny that that's coming out now in the
[02:26:17.360 --> 02:26:21.920]  wake of what's going on in Ferguson with excessive military militarized police
[02:26:21.920 --> 02:26:25.960]  and their unprofessionalism and how they're acting out of control and how
[02:26:25.960 --> 02:26:30.200]  they're restricted media and how they're taking our rights away this is not a
[02:26:30.200 --> 02:26:37.520]  coincidence this is all coming out now well look at how they're aiming look at
[02:26:37.520 --> 02:26:41.560]  how they're aiming rifles at our reporters in broad daylight and smiling
[02:26:41.560 --> 02:26:44.800]  they've told them get ready to mow everybody down and this is all some
[02:26:44.800 --> 02:26:51.800]  beta test this is crazy town the police of the military to see if they'll do it
[02:26:51.800 --> 02:26:56.600]  show yes I've had sniper rifles pointed at me the first day that I have a
[02:26:56.600 --> 02:27:01.160]  second day I got here right at my chest I'm sitting here filming and then the
[02:27:01.160 --> 02:27:05.200]  other night Saturday night I had two separate laser beams on my back while
[02:27:05.200 --> 02:27:11.360]  I'm running with my hands up I just can I'm a journalist and I have a media
[02:27:11.360 --> 02:27:16.680]  written all over me I've even checked in with those same police officers just
[02:27:16.680 --> 02:27:21.760]  prior to that so they knew exactly who I was they are teaching them that we're
[02:27:21.760 --> 02:27:26.160]  the enemy and as you said they had five to one cops for the media instead of
[02:27:26.160 --> 02:27:29.720]  the looters last night this is incredible Rob do just came in here he
[02:27:29.720 --> 02:27:33.960]  must have some breaking news Rob do the news director for the TV side go ahead
[02:27:33.960 --> 02:27:38.320]  well this came a tip from a Thomas in Miami, Florida he works for Florida
[02:27:38.320 --> 02:27:42.240]  News Service and he said please remind Alex reporters do not just have First
[02:27:42.240 --> 02:27:45.480]  Amendment rights but also Fourth of State rights to report to the general
[02:27:45.480 --> 02:27:50.240]  public and they they can basically go inside police lines like general public
[02:27:50.240 --> 02:27:54.360]  cannot reporters can do that under the Fourth of State rights so well in the
[02:27:54.360 --> 02:27:58.800]  past because the police oh we want reporters here we want you to see what
[02:27:58.800 --> 02:28:02.320]  really happened to get the information well this is unprecedented exactly going
[02:28:02.320 --> 02:28:05.560]  after reporters is unprecedented and they just don't want people to see what's
[02:28:05.560 --> 02:28:08.720]  going on in case the police mess up and there's a reporter there catching it
[02:28:08.720 --> 02:28:13.720]  because now it goes that instantaneous I mean the last few nights watching what's
[02:28:13.720 --> 02:28:18.280]  going on with the you stream live stream everybody just putting stuff up it
[02:28:18.280 --> 02:28:22.120]  really is amazing and the media is really showing its power at this point
[02:28:22.120 --> 02:28:25.360]  and you can tell because the cops are scared the cops are scared of the media
[02:28:25.360 --> 02:28:28.560]  they keep pushing them back and pushing them back and it it's disgusting but it
[02:28:28.560 --> 02:28:31.600]  also shows how much power we have by just being there and showing up with
[02:28:31.600 --> 02:28:36.360]  cameras Joe the way to do this is to go befriend three or four strategic houses
[02:28:36.360 --> 02:28:41.560]  in the area and even offer to give them some money to let you use their houses
[02:28:41.560 --> 02:28:45.440]  as bases at night that's the way to stay in there and then to go get those
[02:28:45.440 --> 02:28:49.520]  reports done so you've done a great job I'm gonna let you go we need to get to
[02:28:49.520 --> 02:28:53.680]  these phone calls but great job and just stay safe tonight or stay outside the
[02:28:53.680 --> 02:28:57.640]  police lines but as you said they just keep pushing you back pretty soon
[02:28:57.640 --> 02:29:02.200]  they'll push you so far south you'll be back in Austin Texas yeah I have a I
[02:29:02.200 --> 02:29:05.520]  have a plan for tonight though I think I'm gonna get back and the side road
[02:29:05.520 --> 02:29:09.040]  where that neighborhood is so when they do start trying to sweep everybody out
[02:29:09.040 --> 02:29:12.880]  I'll be back in that area and I could go ahead and start filming them and watch
[02:29:12.880 --> 02:29:16.000]  them when they come into the the neighborhood and I want to see exactly
[02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:20.360]  what they're doing I've already seen a bush a yard where I want to hide I'm
[02:29:20.360 --> 02:29:24.760]  just gonna get down lay down and film well that sounds like it's somewhat of a
[02:29:24.760 --> 02:29:29.280]  plan but you'll have the homeowners rights at your back if you make friends
[02:29:29.280 --> 02:29:34.600]  with the locals don't you think that's what needs to be done yeah exactly well
[02:29:34.600 --> 02:29:38.960]  we'll all be watching tonight at info wars.com right for Joe Biggs and the

[02:33:06.600 --> 02:33:10.880]  GCN radio network
[02:33:36.600 --> 02:33:50.040]  I appreciate Cheryl Chumley joining us we're gonna have her on for an hour but
[02:33:50.040 --> 02:33:55.160]  the police state is unfolding so fast that we've only got her on for 30 minutes
[02:33:55.160 --> 02:33:58.320]  but I want to invite her back home for a full hour the next few weeks she was
[02:33:58.320 --> 02:34:03.080]  also on the day of the night you know I know a lot about the police state and
[02:34:03.080 --> 02:34:07.720]  folks you know out there might think that I couldn't learn something or you
[02:34:07.720 --> 02:34:12.080]  couldn't learn something from a book it's put out by world net daily forwarded
[02:34:12.080 --> 02:34:17.600]  by Congressman Louie Gohmert police state USA how Orwell's nightmare is
[02:34:17.600 --> 02:34:22.720]  becoming our reality Cheryl K. Chumley and the fact that it's forwarded by a
[02:34:22.720 --> 02:34:27.520]  Texas Republican who is pro law and order shows how the libertarian
[02:34:27.520 --> 02:34:31.560]  conservative movement is getting concerned about the militarization that's
[02:34:31.560 --> 02:34:36.480]  what's upsetting the power structure and the feds they want to federalize the
[02:34:36.480 --> 02:34:42.720]  police and they want to use disasters like Ferguson as a pretext to do that
[02:34:42.720 --> 02:34:50.760]  so we're not here to demonize the police we're also not here to support them
[02:34:50.760 --> 02:34:56.240]  attacking reporters or attacking peaceful demonstrators five to one last
[02:34:56.240 --> 02:35:03.080]  night police for the reporters for the police that we saw going after looters
[02:35:03.080 --> 02:35:07.960]  and people burning down businesses so again the looters are horrible but then
[02:35:07.960 --> 02:35:11.840]  does that mean the police can look at our reporters who are clean-cut and who
[02:35:11.840 --> 02:35:16.600]  are polite and who they've even checked in with and sit there looking like they
[02:35:16.600 --> 02:35:21.160]  want to kill them and pointing guns at them I mean if I was there I'd be like
[02:35:21.160 --> 02:35:26.560]  what is your problem why are you looking at me like that I'm an American I've
[02:35:26.560 --> 02:35:31.880]  done nothing to you I'm the press how dare you point a gun at me how dare you
[02:35:31.880 --> 02:35:36.880]  there's an earlier video they were showing where's this big riot cop and
[02:35:36.880 --> 02:35:41.640]  man he's looking at Josh just like he wants to kill him looking right at the
[02:35:41.640 --> 02:35:47.360]  camera just just like what do they do show them videos of the press like
[02:35:47.360 --> 02:35:51.960]  eating children or something I mean how does that cop look at him like that I
[02:35:51.960 --> 02:35:57.240]  mean I would just get very upset like why are you looking at me like you want
[02:35:57.240 --> 02:36:01.800]  to kill me what is your problem where I come from in Dallas I mean you look at
[02:36:01.800 --> 02:36:04.920]  somebody like that on the street they're gonna just get out of their car and say
[02:36:04.920 --> 02:36:09.680]  what you I mean you got a problem I mean what are you looking at me like you
[02:36:09.680 --> 02:36:12.640]  want to kill me for what are you pointing a gun at me for I've done
[02:36:12.640 --> 02:36:20.840]  anything to you I mean it's disgusting the mentality they put in some of these

[02:37:15.960 --> 02:37:21.640]  your take on what's happening in Ferguson right now and then I want to
[02:37:21.640 --> 02:37:26.840]  backtrack it into your book that goes over the history of this and how it's
[02:37:26.840 --> 02:37:31.600]  developed but quite simply you've got a lot of military industrial complex
[02:37:31.600 --> 02:37:36.800]  interests a lot of them that are foreign who want a new market and they know
[02:37:36.800 --> 02:37:40.440]  there's a lot of social problems in America that have been exacerbated in
[02:37:40.440 --> 02:37:45.400]  my view by the left who wants dependence and so there is a real market to not
[02:37:45.400 --> 02:37:49.280]  fix problems but to actually let them get worse like FEMA got its funding
[02:37:49.280 --> 02:37:53.760]  doubled for disasters after Katrina so we have a government where screwing up
[02:37:53.760 --> 02:37:58.600]  gets you a bigger budget well that's a recipe for disaster in my view we've
[02:37:58.600 --> 02:38:02.620]  had sociologists come out and say no that's why the political class wants to
[02:38:02.620 --> 02:38:07.840]  create crises or exacerbate them as the former White House Chief of Staff said
[02:38:07.840 --> 02:38:11.680]  a few years ago Rahm Emanuel so again thank you so much for coming on with
[02:38:11.680 --> 02:38:14.840]  us folks can also get the book and bookstores everywhere I've seen it in
[02:38:14.840 --> 02:38:20.400]  Barnes & Noble or at WND.com thank you for coming on hey Alex thank you so
[02:38:20.400 --> 02:38:23.960]  much for having me it's great to be here so the circumstances aren't the best
[02:38:23.960 --> 02:38:31.280]  with Ferguson in the background give us your take on Ferguson you know it's
[02:38:31.280 --> 02:38:35.720]  it's a moving target right now but I will say when Ferguson first broke my
[02:38:35.720 --> 02:38:40.400]  initial reaction was to wonder why the police had to roll up the military
[02:38:40.400 --> 02:38:45.400]  grain equipment so quickly you know now you look at the scenes and a lot of
[02:38:45.400 --> 02:38:49.640]  people will look at what the police are using in terms of what they say they
[02:38:49.640 --> 02:38:54.240]  need to justify to defend their police officers keep them safe and a lot of
[02:38:54.240 --> 02:38:57.640]  people might agree with that but if you go back in time to when the protests
[02:38:57.640 --> 02:39:03.160]  first started it just seems like police went to level 10 on rolling out the
[02:39:03.160 --> 02:39:08.320]  equipment where they could have started off maybe at level 2 or 3 and they're
[02:39:08.320 --> 02:39:12.840]  not stupid the people given the orders know full well that was provocative the
[02:39:12.840 --> 02:39:17.520]  feds have been there since the start we have a lot of the history of provocateurs
[02:39:17.520 --> 02:39:24.760]  especially with the feds I guess to again create a threat or exacerbate it so
[02:39:24.760 --> 02:39:28.840]  they get more funding tell us a little bit about yourself you've got a very
[02:39:28.840 --> 02:39:32.200]  interesting bio as a journalist but but what got you interested in the police
[02:39:32.200 --> 02:39:37.120]  state and how did you do the research to put together such a powerful powerful
[02:39:37.120 --> 02:39:42.400]  book thank you for the kind words on that I appreciate it my background is
[02:39:42.400 --> 02:39:46.640]  about 15 years now in reporting and journalism and like most reporters I
[02:39:46.640 --> 02:39:51.520]  started out on the local level and I kind of keyed in on constitutional issues
[02:39:51.520 --> 02:39:55.480]  when I would go to board of supervisor meetings and zoning meetings I would
[02:39:55.480 --> 02:40:01.160]  notice how local regulators had great impact on stopping people from building
[02:40:01.160 --> 02:40:05.200]  a home from putting up a shed from paving a driveway and I noticed that all
[02:40:05.200 --> 02:40:10.320]  came from the federal government the EPA and so forth and so I just kept track of
[02:40:10.320 --> 02:40:14.560]  things through the years and when I went to research this book I didn't have to
[02:40:14.560 --> 02:40:19.080]  look hard it was more paring down examples of what's going on in terms of
[02:40:19.080 --> 02:40:24.120]  driving our nation down a police state it was a lot harder to decide what to
[02:40:24.120 --> 02:40:29.400]  keep out than to scour her things to put in and you know I have four kids I
[02:40:29.400 --> 02:40:33.760]  happen to think our nation is the best in the world and I would like to keep it
[02:40:33.760 --> 02:40:39.280]  that way for future generations where should we start breaking down the
[02:40:39.280 --> 02:40:44.840]  police state well Ferguson is definitely the platform but I sure do wish we had
[02:40:44.840 --> 02:40:49.880]  had this talk back when I you know the toddler in Atlanta was busy being blown
[02:40:49.880 --> 02:40:54.880]  up by SWAT team tactics run amok and you know that would have been the perfect
[02:40:54.880 --> 02:41:00.600]  example of how police should not have military great equipment because all it
[02:41:00.600 --> 02:41:05.680]  does is entice them to use it for missions and for roles that are better
[02:41:05.680 --> 02:41:10.240]  served with a knock on the door you know people are dying in America because
[02:41:10.240 --> 02:41:15.640]  police with military equipment are taking it on themselves to use that
[02:41:15.640 --> 02:41:20.360]  equipment for things that could be better served to just like how police used
[02:41:20.360 --> 02:41:24.800]  to do it 20 years ago with a more protect and serve mentality and this is
[02:41:24.800 --> 02:41:28.160]  the perfect opportunity though with Ferguson bringing it back in the limelight
[02:41:28.160 --> 02:41:31.600]  to look at why police have this equipment in the first place and what
[02:41:31.600 --> 02:41:41.080]  Americans can do to curb its use I mean the book as you said is just full of
[02:41:41.080 --> 02:41:44.280]  examples of the police state but but for folks that haven't read the book or who
[02:41:44.280 --> 02:41:52.960]  aren't experts on it okay I'm sorry I also cover you know that's just one
[02:41:52.960 --> 02:41:58.600]  chapter in my book if you look at the EPA what the EPA does on a daily basis not
[02:41:58.600 --> 02:42:02.800]  just at the federal level but how those trickle down to the local level if you
[02:42:02.800 --> 02:42:07.280]  look at the emerging use of drones now you have California and Arizona police
[02:42:07.280 --> 02:42:12.400]  departments picking that up you have the business sector hoping to hop aboard and
[02:42:12.400 --> 02:42:16.840]  use drones if you look at some of the surveillance activity I know all your
[02:42:16.840 --> 02:42:21.680]  listeners are aware of the latest from Edward Snowden but they may not be aware
[02:42:21.680 --> 02:42:26.560]  of what private businesses are doing to snatch up some of this technology or you
[02:42:26.560 --> 02:42:30.920]  can spy on people when you walk into a store now your your department store
[02:42:30.920 --> 02:42:35.880]  may be pinging off your cell phone to alert the owners that you are a high
[02:42:35.880 --> 02:42:40.800]  dollar value shopper and that you've just entered the store the mannequins may
[02:42:40.800 --> 02:42:44.960]  actually have recording and video and audio recording devices in their heads
[02:42:44.960 --> 02:42:49.600]  to not watch for theft control but basically to pick up what shoppers are
[02:42:49.600 --> 02:42:54.400]  saying in the stores in order to use for marketing reasons I have a chapter on
[02:42:54.400 --> 02:42:58.480]  executive orders you know you look at President Obama bragging to the world
[02:42:58.480 --> 02:43:02.760]  that he doesn't need Congress he has a pen he has a telephone who needs the law
[02:43:02.760 --> 02:43:06.880]  the Constitution in Congress if you look at what's going on in our schools
[02:43:06.880 --> 02:43:11.960]  Michelle Obama the Queen Nanny telling parents in America how they should feed
[02:43:11.960 --> 02:43:16.040]  their own children you know that's what's important that's why I like your book
[02:43:16.040 --> 02:43:21.520]  is because we think of the police state as armored vehicles and L rads rubber
[02:43:21.520 --> 02:43:27.200]  bullets cops in space invaders sci-fi stormtrooper outfits and certainly
[02:43:27.200 --> 02:43:32.560]  that's part of it but the police state isn't even really about the cops the
[02:43:32.560 --> 02:43:37.960]  media has spun it that your anti-police have used the word police state no
[02:43:37.960 --> 02:43:42.920]  police state means 1984 police state means North Korea police state means
[02:43:42.920 --> 02:43:49.600]  Mexico police state means a failed state it means a country that's a banana
[02:43:49.600 --> 02:43:55.440]  republic so why was this premeditatedly being set up not to secure the republic
[02:43:55.440 --> 02:43:59.440]  but to overthrow it and the corrupt political class and then you bring in
[02:43:59.440 --> 02:44:04.720]  the police state is about arbitrary power I mean until a decade ago they
[02:44:04.720 --> 02:44:08.840]  had to pay you when they took your property market value with imminent
[02:44:08.840 --> 02:44:12.880]  domain now they just take it and don't even pay you and so that's what your
[02:44:12.880 --> 02:44:17.640]  book gets into is so many areas of the police state that I hadn't even thought
[02:44:17.640 --> 02:44:22.920]  to call police state I would call a sense 21 tyranny but really you're right
[02:44:22.920 --> 02:44:28.760]  it is it is the police state it is the end of checks and balances it is just
[02:44:28.760 --> 02:44:35.160]  arbitrary global rule UN treaties that we're not even signatories to being
[02:44:35.160 --> 02:44:40.120]  implemented by the bureaucracies it's like Obama is implementing gun control
[02:44:40.120 --> 02:44:45.960]  by executive action and he points to the UN as his authority and here's the real
[02:44:45.960 --> 02:44:50.280]  danger most of it's being done with a smile most of it's being done with the
[02:44:50.280 --> 02:44:54.760]  justification it's either for the children or it's for the security of the
[02:44:54.760 --> 02:44:59.360]  nation so the people who are doing these regulatory controls they're doing it by
[02:44:59.360 --> 02:45:03.840]  patting themselves on the back and they're receiving praise from people
[02:45:03.840 --> 02:45:08.160]  who think wow you care so much about American people that you want to help
[02:45:08.160 --> 02:45:12.800]  out you want to help with security or when I hear security nowadays coming from
[02:45:12.800 --> 02:45:16.680]  the government I think regulation and control because that's what so much of
[02:45:16.680 --> 02:45:22.160]  this talk is bringing there's a lot of good news though we always have about
[02:45:22.160 --> 02:45:28.280]  Hollywood being so corrupt and evil there's a libertarian neo conservative
[02:45:28.280 --> 02:45:31.440]  but not the neo Conway but a new conservative movement is more
[02:45:31.440 --> 02:45:34.960]  constitutionally based it's actually a return to the paleo conservatives it's
[02:45:34.960 --> 02:45:38.080]  come out in the news that their secret libertarian and conservative quote
[02:45:38.080 --> 02:45:42.720]  societies in LA they're not really secret societies it's that you'll lose your
[02:45:42.720 --> 02:45:46.960]  job if it comes out you're not basically a communist I mean I've had Hollywood
[02:45:46.960 --> 02:45:50.400]  people tell me I had to come out and support Obama or I wouldn't have gotten
[02:45:50.400 --> 02:45:54.320]  this new contract or I wouldn't have gotten this TV show but gee I hate him
[02:45:54.320 --> 02:45:59.560]  but I wouldn't solve the giver last night anti-abortion libertarian
[02:45:59.560 --> 02:46:05.760]  anti-drone anti-collectivist film very well done Jeff Bridges so many of the
[02:46:05.760 --> 02:46:12.240]  films I see now man of steel the list goes on and on actually have a the
[02:46:12.240 --> 02:46:18.720]  Winter Soldier Captain America absolutely pro-liberty view describes how
[02:46:18.720 --> 02:46:22.600]  criminal elements are hijacking the government so there's a lot of good
[02:46:22.600 --> 02:46:27.800]  signs as well Rand Paul has come out against the police state we've seen a
[02:46:27.800 --> 02:46:31.960]  lot of the so-called left coming out against it we've seen a lot of sheriffs
[02:46:31.960 --> 02:46:37.760]  and police chief saying they don't want to dress like stormtroopers and so we're
[02:46:37.760 --> 02:46:42.920]  seeing some departments actually learn about soft power and go back to actually
[02:46:42.920 --> 02:46:46.200]  having a good relationship with the public while we see other departments
[02:46:46.200 --> 02:46:50.320]  going the other way so I see a battle for the heart and soul of this country
[02:46:50.320 --> 02:46:55.200]  going on right now that's a absolutely right and that's a big reason why I wrote
[02:46:55.200 --> 02:46:59.920]  this book also I think if people are educated to know all the different areas
[02:46:59.920 --> 02:47:04.680]  that we're being attacked you know people will be outraged and they'll want to
[02:47:04.680 --> 02:47:10.000]  act because I truly believe that most Americans love their freedom they're
[02:47:10.000 --> 02:47:14.440]  patriotic they believe that the founding fathers created this nation on the
[02:47:14.440 --> 02:47:18.480]  principle that our rights come from God not government that they're you know
[02:47:18.480 --> 02:47:23.080]  really upset with how the Obama administration is taking control and
[02:47:23.080 --> 02:47:27.600]  power away from the people and doing it with such an elitist arrogant attitude
[02:47:27.600 --> 02:47:31.080]  and I think people just need to know that you know what you were just
[02:47:31.080 --> 02:47:34.960]  describing is true there's a lot of optimism there's a lot of hope still and
[02:47:34.960 --> 02:47:39.440]  this still is our nation it's a nation of of buying for the people form of
[02:47:39.440 --> 02:47:43.560]  government which means we get the chance to boot these people from office and we
[02:47:43.560 --> 02:47:48.080]  can stand up and you know our voices are very powerful and if we want our
[02:47:48.080 --> 02:47:54.080]  freedoms back we can certainly take them we've got some bad news I had Joe
[02:47:54.080 --> 02:47:59.600]  Biggs on just about 25 minutes ago and predicted that you would end up having
[02:47:59.600 --> 02:48:03.280]  police or the National Guard especially the National Guard because these are
[02:48:03.280 --> 02:48:08.680]  kids wearing burritos on their side Joe says he's never seen people this young
[02:48:08.680 --> 02:48:15.000]  in the guard they have literally sent the absolute newest recruits there with
[02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:20.080]  some very unsavory rabble rousers that are burning buildings down and really
[02:48:20.080 --> 02:48:25.160]  stirring things up and attacking our reporters and other people and and and
[02:48:25.160 --> 02:48:29.080]  now the police department has tweeted we'll put it back on screen and I will
[02:48:29.080 --> 02:48:35.320]  read this for folks NBC news officer involved in shooting outside Ferguson a
[02:48:35.320 --> 02:48:40.560]  police officer was involved in a shooting Tuesday in st. Louis about three
[02:48:40.560 --> 02:48:44.400]  miles from where Michael Brown was shot and killed in the turbulent suburb of
[02:48:44.400 --> 02:48:49.400]  Ferguson police confirmed it was a heavy police presence at scene and police
[02:48:49.400 --> 02:48:54.960]  marked off the intersection with yellow tape st. Louis police chief Sam
[02:48:54.960 --> 02:49:00.800]  Dotson said on Twitter that the suspect had brandish a knife at police further
[02:49:00.800 --> 02:49:06.680]  details were unclear here is the chief police tweet officer involved shooting
[02:49:06.680 --> 02:49:12.000]  in a six-district suspect brandish knife at officers that no officers injured
[02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:18.200]  investigation is ongoing and this is deteriorating very quickly I talked to a
[02:49:18.200 --> 02:49:23.200]  lawyer who I know in st. Louis who deals with the police I talked to another
[02:49:23.200 --> 02:49:28.320]  lawyer in Kansas City who's formerly lived in st. Louis that I know and they
[02:49:28.320 --> 02:49:31.520]  predicted when I talked to him last weekend that this was far from over and
[02:49:31.520 --> 02:49:35.600]  they both said bottom line it's gonna get a lot worse I'm concerned about this
[02:49:35.600 --> 02:49:40.320]  spilling out in the rest of the country and I wish it would have been handled
[02:49:40.320 --> 02:49:45.360]  better earlier by releasing the full report by listening to the community and
[02:49:45.360 --> 02:49:51.480]  not being heavy-handed and I wish those thugs using Craigslist hadn't come into
[02:49:51.480 --> 02:49:57.920]  town and looted as their excuse to steal this is so horrible for the inner
[02:49:57.920 --> 02:50:02.680]  city communities everybody else it's just a terrible situation what's your
[02:50:02.680 --> 02:50:07.600]  gut tell you is gonna happen yeah I think you know there are some real strong
[02:50:07.600 --> 02:50:13.760]  demands that the officer be charged with some type of murder rap and if that
[02:50:13.760 --> 02:50:18.000]  doesn't happen I do agree that the violence is going to escalate I think
[02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:21.920]  that's kind of what everybody's waiting right now to hear on as far as the
[02:50:21.920 --> 02:50:25.720]  spillover I believe I've already seen reports that it has kind of seeped out

[02:54:25.600 --> 02:54:31.200]  microcosm of the rest of the world and our country this march towards a high
[02:54:31.200 --> 02:54:37.320]  tech orwellian grid is happening everywhere and police states that never
[02:54:37.320 --> 02:54:43.080]  bring security that's always done because the establishment has decided to go the
[02:54:43.080 --> 02:54:53.160]  route of tyranny not prosperity and all of the things that are being deployed
[02:54:53.160 --> 02:54:59.800]  against the population here we'll end up being used against veterans gun owners

[02:55:18.240 --> 02:55:25.880]  becoming a reality and even if you already know about most of this it's
[02:55:25.880 --> 02:55:29.400]  important to give this to your police chief to your county commissioner we
[02:55:29.400 --> 02:55:33.080]  can turn the tide there's a major movement of police chiefs and sheriffs
[02:55:33.080 --> 02:55:37.400]  and others look at Detroit when they have an officer involved shooting they
[02:55:37.400 --> 02:55:43.400]  just released the information the police chief tells the citizens go out get
[02:55:43.400 --> 02:55:49.040]  guns defend yourself from thugs and the community works together and now their
[02:55:49.040 --> 02:55:53.960]  crime rate with it gone sky high is starting to go down so that's the
[02:55:53.960 --> 02:55:58.400]  answer is not in us against them mentality but sometimes you got to hit
[02:55:58.400 --> 02:56:02.080]  rock bottom before before that happens we'll do a little bit overdrive and take
[02:56:02.080 --> 02:56:10.000]  your calls for Bella who's been holding like a trooper and Chris and others but

[02:56:15.720 --> 02:56:22.520]  another shooting in Ferguson just in the last 30 minutes our reporters are
[02:56:22.520 --> 02:56:27.840]  about to be on the scene and I will go into overdrive all take your calls to
[02:56:27.840 --> 02:56:32.040]  see if they can get in place and give us a report on what's happening but I
[02:56:32.040 --> 02:56:38.360]  you were finishing up by saying there is an idea here
[02:56:39.120 --> 02:56:47.720]  that somebody needs to get in trouble and that this officer needs to get
[02:56:47.720 --> 02:56:52.240]  indicted for something but if the man charged him and attacked him and then
[02:56:52.240 --> 02:56:57.080]  ran back and he shot him and you know the witnesses had he shot him in the back
[02:56:57.080 --> 02:57:02.000]  that's not true now according to independent autopsy there are a lot
[02:57:02.000 --> 02:57:05.840]  of witnesses coming out I don't think we know the truth because police have been
[02:57:05.840 --> 02:57:09.720]  caught lying so much they've lost the moral high ground in many cases but I
[02:57:09.720 --> 02:57:14.160]  think it's leaning towards the officer's story right now and so you can't just
[02:57:14.160 --> 02:57:19.880]  indict him to stop rioting I mean I don't think there's any moral dilemma
[02:57:19.880 --> 02:57:26.120]  here but at the same time with a lot of these crowds it seems like there's
[02:57:26.120 --> 02:57:29.120]  agitators in there that just want to start things up where do you think this
[02:57:29.120 --> 02:57:34.280]  is going well let's not forget that Eric Holder has sent you know plenty of
[02:57:34.280 --> 02:57:38.600]  agents on the scene from six different departments within the Justice Department
[02:57:38.600 --> 02:57:45.160]  to root out how police may have crossed lines and he made that rather
[02:57:45.160 --> 02:57:49.040]  inflammatory statement from Martha's Vineyard where he talked about how
[02:57:49.040 --> 02:57:54.440]  police if they had a more diverse police department it would inspire more trust
[02:57:54.440 --> 02:57:59.040]  in the community of Ferguson so if you look at the Justice Department statement
[02:57:59.040 --> 02:58:02.520]  it seems a little bit alarming that when they're the ones in control of
[02:58:02.520 --> 02:58:06.840]  performing the third autopsy and whether they're taking such a heavy-handed
[02:58:06.840 --> 02:58:12.360]  presence on Ferguson soil which is unprecedented for a federal agency it's
[02:58:12.360 --> 02:58:16.800]  it raises some red flags about whether this is going to be a tainted end result
[02:58:16.800 --> 02:58:19.960]  for the police officer.

[03:00:27.480 --> 03:00:33.400]  on air so here we are. Bella in Missouri what is your take on the situation in
[03:00:33.400 --> 03:00:38.200]  Ferguson I know that's what you called in about. It is it is I lived in
[03:00:38.200 --> 03:00:44.680]  fluorescent drove west fluorescent many times. Missouri is known for a
[03:00:44.680 --> 03:00:50.080]  hospitality and I am and I'd like to apologize for the whole state for what's
[03:00:50.080 --> 03:00:55.160]  going on. Oh come on it's not your fault of the state's fault this is a climate
[03:00:55.160 --> 03:01:00.640]  in America this is what's happened. I came from a very respected political
[03:01:00.640 --> 03:01:07.280]  family however it was a yellow dog Democrat family but you and info wars
[03:01:07.280 --> 03:01:13.920]  helped educate me to see and now I'm a Tea Party. That's awesome. Well my gosh
[03:01:13.920 --> 03:01:20.640]  you know I can't believe what's going on. I used to campaign for Senator Jerry
[03:01:20.640 --> 03:01:28.320]  Litton when I was 13 Governor McCartney was my mentor so this is personal and
[03:01:28.320 --> 03:01:34.160]  God bless you but I do want to tell you something that is important I know a lot
[03:01:34.160 --> 03:01:41.440]  of people think that the supernatural is just absolutely nuts but whatever I am
[03:01:41.440 --> 03:01:47.280]  a say my bloodline goes back to 36 AD in Ireland I was Irish royalty or my
[03:01:47.280 --> 03:01:55.200]  relatives were so I do have the site and so I cannot tell you how relieved I was
[03:01:55.200 --> 03:02:00.680]  to hear you were not going to be there and Ferguson. So you're saying your gut
[03:02:00.680 --> 03:02:06.920]  thinks something what happened to me if I went? Alex I'm a fae what do you think?
[03:02:06.920 --> 03:02:11.160]  Well you know I know I knock on wood and stuff like that but I'm trusting God's
[03:02:11.160 --> 03:02:14.720]  providence so it's time for me to go it's time for me to go. Quite frankly it
[03:02:14.720 --> 03:02:18.480]  sounds like a vacation to go it's kind of be interesting and I would love to be
[03:02:18.480 --> 03:02:21.400]  able to go ask the questions I wanted to ask and get stuff done I was talking
[03:02:21.400 --> 03:02:26.560]  about going last week it's just I have so much to do here running this whole
[03:02:26.560 --> 03:02:31.840]  operation that's why I hired reporters and I've gone out and been in stuff like
[03:02:31.840 --> 03:02:35.040]  this in New York when the police were arresting thousands and I've been
[03:02:35.040 --> 03:02:39.120]  arrested in demonstrations in New York Austin you name it so I'm not afraid to
[03:02:39.120 --> 03:02:44.240]  go to this I've been at the DNC you name it some of the trolls have said I
[03:02:44.240 --> 03:02:49.440]  almost pulled my reporters completely out and they all wanted to go back and so I
[03:02:49.440 --> 03:02:55.840]  said okay I mean it's just such a mess and the whole thing is is upsetting but
[03:02:55.840 --> 03:03:01.320]  I appreciate your call and your kind kind words and your sixth sense let's
[03:03:01.320 --> 03:03:06.160]  talk to Chris in Florida Chris you're on the air go ahead. Well Alex you had two
[03:03:06.160 --> 03:03:09.640]  callers mentioned the problem of the Federal Reserve and we shouldn't wait
[03:03:09.640 --> 03:03:14.000]  for our politicians to do something about it we should as Max Kaiser was
[03:03:14.000 --> 03:03:20.240]  saying on your June 6th 2013 show resort to our only sanctuary alternatives to
[03:03:20.240 --> 03:03:24.960]  commerce like the Bristol pound that he mentioned which is the most ideal for
[03:03:24.960 --> 03:03:29.520]  community currency of which I know in existence that's in Bristol UK and it
[03:03:29.520 --> 03:03:33.720]  can only it can also be used to pay local business taxes the mayor of Bristol is
[03:03:33.720 --> 03:03:37.640]  accepting is there an island off England to call Guernsey or something were they
[03:03:37.640 --> 03:03:41.120]  for hundreds of years by their own currency yes the Guernsey experiment
[03:03:41.120 --> 03:03:46.160]  it's worked out well yeah I mean this stuff really works out well and really
[03:03:46.160 --> 03:03:49.680]  that is the ultimate revolution is economic that's why they want to ban
[03:03:49.680 --> 03:03:54.040]  lemonade stands and farmers markets the big corporations know what they're
[03:03:54.040 --> 03:03:58.240]  doing they don't want us doing local commerce they don't want to supporting
[03:03:58.240 --> 03:04:03.880]  local media or independent media literally our lifestyles where we live
[03:04:03.880 --> 03:04:08.320]  the neighborhoods we build I mean look listen gay people took over the rainbow
[03:04:08.320 --> 03:04:14.440]  used to belong to lucky charms and you know leprechauns and you know magic and
[03:04:14.440 --> 03:04:18.720]  and they took that over have their own neighborhoods all that stuff why can't
[03:04:18.720 --> 03:04:23.440]  liberty lovers build their own culture their own society by pretty much
[03:04:23.440 --> 03:04:27.800]  exclusively supporting each other and I think that's a model of victory and
[03:04:27.800 --> 03:04:32.520]  you're right community currencies crypto currencies stay there I'm gonna come
[03:04:32.520 --> 03:04:35.520]  back to you talk about solutions because I don't want to just sit here and
[03:04:35.520 --> 03:04:39.000]  complain about all this we got goods we've got a lot of police chiefs and
[03:04:39.000 --> 03:04:43.680]  sheriffs waking up got a lot of police waking up ten years ago I was just
[03:04:43.680 --> 03:04:48.200]  bashing the police because I was mad how they were being unconstitutional then
[03:04:48.200 --> 03:04:51.080]  I realized how they're being manipulated have the funding how they're

[03:08:06.680 --> 03:08:14.560]  information war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network our
[03:08:14.560 --> 03:08:20.400]  reporters are very close to another police shooting
[03:08:22.400 --> 03:08:27.160]  and we don't know the details as the police are obviously in control of the
[03:08:27.160 --> 03:08:32.280]  whole situation and have circled the wagons in Ferguson and you could just
[03:08:32.280 --> 03:08:36.680]  feel I mean I said this a month ago on air the next big shooter drop would be a
[03:08:36.680 --> 03:08:43.600]  race riot and provocaturing you could see the White House CMS NBC CC and in here
[03:08:43.600 --> 03:08:48.000]  all the hype the Ford Foundation the open borders there's a live Fox
[03:08:48.000 --> 03:08:55.600]  helicopters St. Louis City police shoot kill knife-wielding suspect and as much
[03:08:55.600 --> 03:08:59.080]  burning and looting as I've seen it's very possible somebody was dumb enough
[03:08:59.080 --> 03:09:03.680]  to wield a knife at cops and come nighttime I think things are gonna
[03:09:03.680 --> 03:09:12.600]  explode I don't know I might have to go up there just to see this for myself and
[03:09:12.600 --> 03:09:16.920]  to try to stop it if I can people say oh how are you gonna stop it well if we
[03:09:16.920 --> 03:09:25.040]  all sit back and think we can't stop it then we won't stop it but they've
[03:09:25.040 --> 03:09:29.880]  primed a race war in this country they got the borders wide open they've got
[03:09:29.880 --> 03:09:36.920]  the cops all in a militarized blockhead mode you got a bunch of knockout game
[03:09:36.920 --> 03:09:41.320]  trash coming into the area to have fun the cops won't go after them when
[03:09:41.320 --> 03:09:45.080]  they're burning stuff down instead they're gonna be gunning down whacked
[03:09:45.080 --> 03:09:50.960]  out of their mind to angry people and you know there's a lot of guns in that
[03:09:50.960 --> 03:09:56.760]  community the police have reportedly already been shot at who knows if that's
[03:09:56.760 --> 03:10:01.840]  true it's probably true that usually happens in these riots what doesn't ever
[03:10:01.840 --> 03:10:09.840]  happen is cops attacking the media this is unbelievable and it just shows how
[03:10:09.840 --> 03:10:16.560]  this country is so screwed up I've seen riots in Brazil riots in Nigeria the
[03:10:16.560 --> 03:10:21.240]  film footage over the decades and recently and the horses will ride right
[03:10:21.240 --> 03:10:25.400]  by and run over people or they'll shoot rubber bullets in a crowd and they
[03:10:25.400 --> 03:10:33.400]  don't mess with the reporters a because you don't want to turn the media
[03:10:33.400 --> 03:10:38.920]  against you be you can't ever stop the reporters from getting the info out it
[03:10:38.920 --> 03:10:43.400]  makes them want to show up even more I found people really aren't even cowards
[03:10:43.400 --> 03:10:47.320]  on average they're lazy and when you make something personal with people
[03:10:47.320 --> 03:10:50.440]  that's why bigs and all them want to stay and don't want to leave they they're
[03:10:50.440 --> 03:10:55.640]  not gonna be run off in fact I predict even though I've told him not to do it
[03:10:55.640 --> 03:10:59.880]  that bigs is gonna really pull some stuff tonight not not bad stuff but I mean
[03:10:59.880 --> 03:11:03.080]  he is gonna be crawling around on the ground in the bushes and you know in
[03:11:03.080 --> 03:11:08.040]  this in in in the drainage pipes you know in the in the manholes I mean just
[03:11:08.040 --> 03:11:11.840]  the whole nine yards and
[03:11:12.960 --> 03:11:19.160]  civil war will be like a big game it'll be a big exciting war and men like to
[03:11:19.160 --> 03:11:21.840]  fight and kill I mean let's just get down to it at the end of the day and
[03:11:21.840 --> 03:11:25.800]  that's what we're designed to know how to do and it just becomes a big game the
[03:11:25.800 --> 03:11:30.400]  cops are gonna have fun we're gonna have fun I mean I'm not gonna have fun I'm
[03:11:30.400 --> 03:11:36.680]  saying the Liberty movement I mean isn't this what the cops signed up for you
[03:11:36.680 --> 03:11:42.320]  signed up for a war you want one the globalists are gonna give you one a big
[03:11:42.320 --> 03:11:48.800]  nice civil war in America disgusting and that's why I'm so upset today I can
[03:11:48.800 --> 03:11:56.800]  feel the doom I can feel it it's it's not depression I don't get depressed it's
[03:11:56.800 --> 03:12:00.200]  like watching a train wreck in slow motion that's pointless and wreck things
[03:12:00.200 --> 03:12:13.120]  and I care about the protesters I can't stand the manipulated looters the cops
[03:12:14.200 --> 03:12:19.880]  day one you know two days into this when I'm going to your calls when the
[03:12:19.880 --> 03:12:25.040]  police and stop the looters I said let's let them do the investigation find out
[03:12:25.040 --> 03:12:31.000]  what happened with this 18 year old Brown the police are protecting the
[03:12:31.000 --> 03:12:35.480]  businesses good job they weren't acting like thugs of the reporters that were
[03:12:35.480 --> 03:12:43.760]  there and so I said let's you know back an investigation until we see that they
[03:12:43.760 --> 03:12:47.520]  you know do an investigation and if it's a bad investigation then they're
[03:12:47.520 --> 03:12:52.160]  covering it up and they're wrong but riots aren't gonna help anything that'll
[03:12:52.160 --> 03:12:55.960]  only help the power structure so let's let's support what the police are doing
[03:12:55.960 --> 03:13:02.000]  so far then they act like total crazy third world I mean the third world cops
[03:13:02.000 --> 03:13:07.360]  don't act like this this is mental illness pointing guns at Josh Owens
[03:13:07.360 --> 03:13:13.440]  arresting Washington Post reporters on power trips in military outfits I mean
[03:13:13.440 --> 03:13:16.960]  it's just part of the mental illness in this country a bunch of fake macho
[03:13:16.960 --> 03:13:23.160]  twits and the minute you did that then it gave the thugs the moral high ground
[03:13:23.160 --> 03:13:27.240]  they were able to come in and displace the reasonable demonstrators and this
[03:13:27.240 --> 03:13:31.960]  thing was set up for the makings of riots all over the country the minute
[03:13:31.960 --> 03:13:37.560]  that happened and now the feds are there they've been there for at least a week
[03:13:37.560 --> 03:13:42.400]  and you notice stuff's getting a lot worse it is the feds directing all of
[03:13:42.400 --> 03:13:46.720]  this they've been directing it they're undoubtedly directing the new black
[03:13:46.720 --> 03:13:51.600]  Panther Party who's been caught working for the feds before it is a recipe for
[03:13:51.600 --> 03:13:54.840]  disaster Chris go ahead and make your point from Florida
[03:13:54.840 --> 03:13:59.600]  continuing I don't currently know of any example where the establishment of
[03:13:59.600 --> 03:14:03.440]  attacking community currencies or other alternative forms of commerce to the
[03:14:03.440 --> 03:14:08.000]  fed because it's not pretending to be currency it's time denominated and it's
[03:14:08.000 --> 03:14:12.940]  protected by the same laws that prohibit counterfeiting of say tickets for
[03:14:12.940 --> 03:14:16.840]  movies concerts and sporting events or coupons get certificates or other
[03:14:16.840 --> 03:14:21.480]  negotiable instruments and so if we can allow once the community currency is
[03:14:21.480 --> 03:14:25.480]  popular enough we can go to our city council's county commissions and ask
[03:14:25.480 --> 03:14:29.040]  them well since you're always crying poor you're raising our rates on
[03:14:29.040 --> 03:14:35.000]  utilities etc you know charging fees to go into public lands well how about you
[03:14:35.000 --> 03:14:39.120]  allow your public employees to opt in to be paid a certain percentage as they
[03:14:39.120 --> 03:14:43.800]  have in Bristol in the UK and then they can receive another percentage of pay
[03:14:43.800 --> 03:14:47.640]  as an incentive so that keeps their loyalty local where it belongs rather
[03:14:47.640 --> 03:14:53.720]  than being bought off by the federales who are you know being a you know as
[03:14:53.720 --> 03:14:57.640]  you know about the IMF riot that Greg Talist has reported on and now Chris
[03:14:57.640 --> 03:15:01.960]  Hedges is talking about how they want to instigate riots and they have for such
[03:15:01.960 --> 03:15:08.920]  a long time now the local police won't attack the local employees or business
[03:15:08.920 --> 03:15:14.240]  owners because to do so would attack their own livelihood and so if we can
[03:15:14.240 --> 03:15:18.600]  promote these alternatives to the Federal Reserve note then we can earn
[03:15:18.600 --> 03:15:24.280]  ourselves more time to speak with others to agree with others meet which means
[03:15:24.280 --> 03:15:28.440]  cooperating and becoming more civically involved you know and then we can have
[03:15:28.440 --> 03:15:32.960]  more time to learn the intricacies of the politics law history health
[03:15:32.960 --> 03:15:38.440]  technology and the police data the New World Order we can earn premium services
[03:15:38.440 --> 03:15:42.360]  of food and goods rather than know exactly we've got a vote with our dollars
[03:15:42.360 --> 03:15:45.960]  just like we've done with the organics and the rest of it and we can change the
[03:15:45.960 --> 03:15:49.840]  entire marketplace great call let's talk to Henry in California thanks for
[03:15:49.840 --> 03:15:54.680]  holding you're on the air Henry Alex how you doing long-time listener first
[03:15:54.680 --> 03:15:57.840]  time caller I just have two quick questions how far do you think this
[03:15:57.840 --> 03:16:01.360]  police state has to go for people to finally wake up to the reality it was
[03:16:01.360 --> 03:16:04.680]  taking place and do you think they will stage a terror attack to further
[03:16:04.680 --> 03:16:08.880]  escalate their martial law agenda thanks and keep up the good work thank you
[03:16:08.880 --> 03:16:12.960]  sir yeah first they roll out Homeland Security for radical Muslims while they
[03:16:12.960 --> 03:16:16.200]  actually are funding them and protecting them that's now all admitted
[03:16:16.200 --> 03:16:21.960]  public so I've got a lot of apologies from talk show host other people and I'm
[03:16:21.960 --> 03:16:25.560]  not tootin my horn I'm just saying I've gotten a lot of apologies public
[03:16:25.560 --> 03:16:30.480]  apologies from talk show host saying yeah no it's all true our government runs
[03:16:30.480 --> 03:16:36.360]  ISIS runs al-Qaeda but but again it's not ISIS it's again really al-Qaeda in
[03:16:36.360 --> 03:16:43.800]  Iraq it's not our government either it's criminal elements running it and so they
[03:16:43.800 --> 03:16:47.600]  want a beta test the cops aren't involved in the state's terror attack the
[03:16:47.600 --> 03:16:53.280]  average military are compartmentalized so they have to sell them on the total
[03:16:53.280 --> 03:16:57.520]  occupation of the country so oh you're gonna occupy America to fight al-Qaeda
[03:16:57.520 --> 03:17:02.080]  you're gonna occupy America to fight a bunch of street thugs that are running
[03:17:02.080 --> 03:17:05.800]  around burning down buildings but then all the real training behind the scenes
[03:17:05.800 --> 03:17:11.840]  is for an authoritarian takeover and the looting of the nation by the globalist
[03:17:11.840 --> 03:17:19.360]  and so down the road they're going to have huge terror attacks federal
[03:17:19.360 --> 03:17:25.640]  buildings blown up schools attacked it'll be dead toddlers on the news and oh my
[03:17:25.640 --> 03:17:31.240]  gosh the patriots did it and every major shoot-em-up video game that's coming
[03:17:31.240 --> 03:17:36.240]  out that's based in the u.s. all the big movies I mean large portions of them
[03:17:36.240 --> 03:17:40.360]  tons of the sitcoms the majority everybody sees this I get the calls all
[03:17:40.360 --> 03:17:44.080]  the time it's new stuff every week where the patriots are the bad guys
[03:17:44.080 --> 03:17:50.080]  Green Lantern cartoon has bad guys that wear tri-quartered hats and call
[03:17:50.080 --> 03:17:55.960]  themselves you know the George Washington supporters Paul Revere's so
[03:17:55.960 --> 03:18:00.760]  everybody's subconsciously and consciously programmed that when the
[03:18:00.760 --> 03:18:05.560]  criminal element wants to take out the opposition to their takeover well what
[03:18:05.560 --> 03:18:09.040]  do you do you stage a terror attack and you blame it on him how to hitler attack
[03:18:09.040 --> 03:18:12.680]  Poland the attack three of his own military bases and Operation Himmler
[03:18:12.680 --> 03:18:18.360]  Gliwitz was the best known how do they had tried to attack Russia they have
[03:18:18.360 --> 03:18:21.720]  Ukraine shoot down the jet airliner most the evidence points that way now and
[03:18:21.720 --> 03:18:26.040]  then blame it on the Russians and I'm not romanticizing the Russians the point
[03:18:26.040 --> 03:18:32.680]  is the globalist are the ones starting it and so absolutely is that college still
[03:18:32.680 --> 03:18:41.440]  there because I was gonna let him finish up but yeah it is a false flag it is a
[03:18:41.440 --> 03:18:48.320]  false flag that is what I see and it's not like I see a narrative and no you
[03:18:48.320 --> 03:18:52.640]  know what they might do and so I see everything happening as shadows of that
[03:18:52.640 --> 03:18:59.400]  no no we know their whole program with human intelligence I can go to the
[03:18:59.400 --> 03:19:03.600]  drills and then talk to my sources who tell me they're training to shoot
[03:19:03.600 --> 03:19:10.840]  Americans in mass and now they publicly admit it in the Associated Press and an
[03:19:10.840 --> 03:19:22.320]  army.mil and yeah am I eccentric do I come off as weird yeah I am weird I guess
[03:19:22.320 --> 03:19:26.320]  I am weird that I've cared about this for 20 years I guess I am weird that I saw
[03:19:26.320 --> 03:19:34.600]  it over the horizon before it got here but but now it's here and I guess in a
[03:19:34.600 --> 03:19:39.160]  land of lunatics and a land of lazy people that don't care in a world of
[03:19:39.160 --> 03:19:44.120]  disempowered jellyfish spectators I guess I am weird that I built a media
[03:19:44.120 --> 03:19:48.640]  operation to try to fight this I guess I am upset that I found out that they're
[03:19:48.640 --> 03:19:56.280]  engineering us through the vaccines and the food towards a horrible end and
[03:19:56.280 --> 03:20:04.760]  secret experimentation that's been declassified I mean oh my god do you
[03:20:04.760 --> 03:20:11.400]  understand folks this is real okay and I think it's just really hitting me today
[03:20:11.400 --> 03:20:16.080]  really hitting me hard how real it is I mean this is really all real this is
[03:20:16.080 --> 03:20:22.920]  true we've been right and that is not a good feeling it just gets worse and
[03:20:22.920 --> 03:20:27.880]  worse and worse and I mean Schultz I haven't covered this in two and a half
[03:20:27.880 --> 03:20:34.280]  hours being on air two hours I'm tired now three plus hours of being on
[03:20:34.280 --> 03:20:37.760]  air three hours 20 minutes of being on air
[03:20:37.760 --> 03:20:45.720]  Ed Schultz hate-filled political operative I can read him like a book I
[03:20:45.720 --> 03:20:48.480]  know exactly what gets said at his dinner table everything that goes on with
[03:20:48.480 --> 03:20:56.040]  him oh man I just up there saying that domestic groups that this is for
[03:20:56.040 --> 03:21:01.760]  basically the Tea Party MSNBC host maybe cops he military gear to deal with
[03:21:01.760 --> 03:21:05.600]  anti-government groups and when they say that on MSNBC they mean anybody who
[03:21:05.600 --> 03:21:11.040]  believes that we shouldn't be Ed Schultz a slave I mean I'm so sick of these
[03:21:11.040 --> 03:21:17.240]  rich entitled globalist most of them don't even pay taxes above the law do
[03:21:17.240 --> 03:21:22.240]  whatever they want and they're building up this treason force to smash the
[03:21:22.240 --> 03:21:28.840]  patriot movement and I'm just waiting for them to stage their false flags and
[03:21:28.840 --> 03:21:33.440]  blame it on me I mean MSNBC has already done this over and over again I'm
[03:21:33.440 --> 03:21:37.240]  behind every police shooting I'm calling for killing the cops when I'm calling
[03:21:37.240 --> 03:21:43.800]  for the opposite I'm behind the boss in bombing I'm deeply racist I mean folks
[03:21:43.800 --> 03:21:49.120]  can you imagine what it's like to be on the receiving end I mean I'll be quite
[03:21:49.120 --> 03:21:54.960]  frank with you I don't want any violence against the police I would love and the
[03:21:54.960 --> 03:21:57.800]  only way I can legally say this is a challenge even to a charity boxing
[03:21:57.800 --> 03:22:01.160]  match bare knuckles I love to get in the ring with with Schultz he thinks he's so
[03:22:01.160 --> 03:22:05.960]  tough below Riley same thing I am so sick of all these fake tough guys sitting
[03:22:05.960 --> 03:22:09.520]  there manipulating their audience I mean I couldn't imagine sitting up here
[03:22:09.520 --> 03:22:14.920]  knowing psychology and lying to people and twisting and demonizing good people
[03:22:14.920 --> 03:22:20.720]  and engaging in fraud it makes me want to throw up I mean I every time I see Ed
[03:22:20.720 --> 03:22:24.680]  Schultz on the screen when it scrolls through info wars I want to turn this
[03:22:24.680 --> 03:22:29.960]  table over I mean I'm gonna be honest with you just he makes me want to throw
[03:22:29.960 --> 03:22:34.760]  up he is disgusting I don't even have words to describe what a piece of trash
[03:22:34.760 --> 03:22:47.200]  he is big fat bully big fat just I guarantee he smells like you know what
[03:22:47.200 --> 03:22:52.560]  when I look at him you I don't know how to describe it he is a pile of you know
[03:22:52.560 --> 03:22:57.680]  what see I shouldn't be doing radio on this man I think I'm gonna take off
[03:22:57.680 --> 03:23:01.280]  tomorrow I don't think I'm gonna I think I'm gonna have a David I come in here
[03:23:01.280 --> 03:23:05.080]  because I just I mean this is not an act folks and then I get up here it's like
[03:23:05.080 --> 03:23:08.360]  I'm trapped on air there's all this stuff to cover and I don't want to talk
[03:23:08.360 --> 03:23:13.560]  about myself I just cannot imagine how people put up with any of this the
[03:23:13.560 --> 03:23:18.480]  enemy of this country is people like Rachel Maddow and Ed Schultz the enemy
[03:23:18.480 --> 03:23:23.080]  is is people like Obama and the social engineers that know everything I know
[03:23:23.080 --> 03:23:30.920]  and more but they decide to screw over humanity they know obama cares got death
[03:23:30.920 --> 03:23:37.560]  panels in it they know that they got our military on death panels and do not
[03:23:37.560 --> 03:23:45.280]  treat do not give care to veterans with skin cancer and stuff these people are
[03:23:45.280 --> 03:23:51.560]  predators and the police and military will not wake up to that and will not
[03:23:51.560 --> 03:23:55.120]  get angry about that and will not recognize that the Patriot movement's
[03:23:55.120 --> 03:24:00.480]  about to be set up by these sacks of crap then you all deserve what's gonna
[03:24:00.480 --> 03:24:09.840]  happen they are gonna stage a civil war in this country they are going to blow
[03:24:09.840 --> 03:24:14.440]  stuff up do you understand that it's sure as the sun comes up that's probably
[03:24:14.440 --> 03:24:19.480]  the next shooting drop and the only reason they haven't done it yet is
[03:24:19.480 --> 03:24:22.720]  because we're exposing them and they know our people are watching we caught
[03:24:22.720 --> 03:24:27.160]  them with the CIA getting the underwear bomber on the plane we broke that with
[03:24:27.160 --> 03:24:31.400]  the eyewitnesses and it was confirmed later in Congress we know the enemy we
[03:24:31.400 --> 03:24:34.640]  know what they're planning do I know when they're gonna strike no but I know
[03:24:34.640 --> 03:24:39.800]  what their modus operandi is and I am sick of them if people would just wake
[03:24:39.800 --> 03:24:43.440]  up to how evil this government is and how illegitimate it is and we will
[03:24:43.440 --> 03:24:46.800]  restore the republic we wouldn't have to go through this but the reason I'm
[03:24:46.800 --> 03:24:52.200]  upset is we are now up to the edge of the cliff with these people we are now
[03:24:52.200 --> 03:24:56.160]  about to take the plunge just to sure as the sun came up this morning for the
[03:24:56.160 --> 03:25:00.680]  next level of this you think they're not going for broke when the borders are
[03:25:00.680 --> 03:25:04.680]  wide open when they're publicly funding al-qaeda to run around murder every
[03:25:04.680 --> 03:25:08.240]  Christian they can find this is they're going on all cylinders they're gonna
[03:25:08.240 --> 03:25:12.240]  launch everything they're launching everything right now in the scale of
[03:25:12.240 --> 03:25:16.280]  time the next year the next two years is like a blink of an eye in the scale of
[03:25:16.280 --> 03:25:20.880]  humanity and I'm telling you right now is the war right now is the enemy coming
[03:25:20.880 --> 03:25:27.480]  over the gates right now this is it people Chuck in Ohio thanks for holding
[03:25:27.480 --> 03:25:32.720]  go ahead yes Alex if I get one thing right on this call I just want to say
[03:25:32.720 --> 03:25:36.840]  I'm proud to be crazy like Alex Jones I wish you on lighter days I wish you
[03:25:36.840 --> 03:25:42.160]  play that song a little more thank you sweetheart go ahead okay I want to talk
[03:25:42.160 --> 03:25:46.120]  about the army document but first I wanted to find the press I haven't had
[03:25:46.120 --> 03:25:50.240]  television in three years and just recently I started watching the evening
[03:25:50.240 --> 03:25:54.520]  news again and I wanted to find them you're always having trouble just how
[03:25:54.520 --> 03:25:58.960]  do you describe them and I want to describe them as the propaganda press
[03:25:58.960 --> 03:26:04.000]  it kind of has Gerald Salente's illiterate alliteration in it and it's
[03:26:04.000 --> 03:26:09.920]  what they are they're Goebbels 2.0 for example last night on NBC news Brian
[03:26:09.920 --> 03:26:15.400]  Williams is at a peace on be terrified of the Sun and of course the Sun
[03:26:15.400 --> 03:26:20.160]  creates vitamin D which prevents cancer but be terrified of the Sun because you
[03:26:20.160 --> 03:26:24.520]  might get cancer meanwhile Brian Williams looks like he lives in a tanning
[03:26:24.520 --> 03:26:30.320]  bed exactly right propaganda press they're kind of in love with themselves
[03:26:30.320 --> 03:26:36.640]  and there were two things Watergate and and the civil rights movement they
[03:26:36.640 --> 03:26:42.040]  they think they're responsible for both of them for exposing Watergate and for
[03:26:42.040 --> 03:26:47.520]  the so and for helping the civil rights movement along well I was wondering if
[03:26:47.520 --> 03:26:53.440]  you could do a what if article you take this new army document and what if in
[03:26:53.440 --> 03:27:00.040]  1955 when Martin Luther King went to the side of Rosa Parks and it led a march
[03:27:00.040 --> 03:27:07.320]  if they had shot Martin Luther King in the head there would have been no civil
[03:27:07.320 --> 03:27:11.520]  rights movement or at least it would have been very different well that's
[03:27:11.520 --> 03:27:20.120]  right we should go at this at other angles what if this is Lexington and
[03:27:20.120 --> 03:27:24.080]  Concord but they were armed at Lexington and Concord and the Red Codes came up
[03:27:24.080 --> 03:27:29.480]  and shot at them this is we will shoot unarmed people as a Psyop it's it's in
[03:27:29.480 --> 03:27:32.840]  the document people can go read the whole thing we have it excised out the
[03:27:32.840 --> 03:27:37.080]  subsections in the article so people can check it on how to kill unarmed people
[03:27:37.080 --> 03:27:41.920]  to scare the population I mean this is an indictment you could put people in
[03:27:41.920 --> 03:27:47.080]  life in prison for this this is a confession of treason by the people
[03:27:47.080 --> 03:27:52.920]  running our military and the point is the propaganda press there are a whole
[03:27:52.920 --> 03:27:56.720]  identity is that they were part of the civil rights movement oh they're a bunch
[03:27:56.720 --> 03:28:00.920]  of a bunch of power-tripping prostitutes who now are all losing their jobs
[03:28:00.920 --> 03:28:04.200]  which is what happens to traders they always think they're gonna gain the
[03:28:04.200 --> 03:28:10.560]  world shelling everybody out then instead they destroy their own future okay
[03:28:10.560 --> 03:28:13.800]  let's go to David in Kentucky I got a jump chuck thank you buddy good points
[03:28:13.800 --> 03:28:20.240]  go ahead David hey I like I want you to check out a video go to Ferguson Missouri

[03:28:41.720 --> 03:28:47.360]  you can see the military police and the m-wrap going down the street looks
[03:28:47.360 --> 03:28:52.840]  like they're hunting Osama bin Laden down and these these bullets actually fly
