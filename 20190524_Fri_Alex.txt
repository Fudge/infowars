[00:00.000 --> 00:29.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the most banned broadcast in the free world.
[00:29.440 --> 00:37.240]  The Alex Jones show, and we are live from the Info Wars World Headquarters in Austin,
[00:37.240 --> 00:42.760]  Texas on this May 24th, 2019.
[00:42.760 --> 00:56.520]  And I've got a message coming up in the next segment that I think you need to hear.
[00:56.520 --> 01:02.640]  But before we get to that, you know, they call Donald Trump, especially over there
[01:02.640 --> 01:06.800]  at CNN, whose ratings are have just totally bottomed out.
[01:06.800 --> 01:16.120]  If it wasn't for airports and hotels and bars, CNN would have no audience.
[01:16.120 --> 01:21.360]  But so they call us the Info Wars President, or they call Trump the Info Wars President.
[01:21.360 --> 01:28.520]  In the last couple days, we've been highlighting how Nancy Pelosi has been a gibbering fool.
[01:28.520 --> 01:33.300]  Embarrassing herself, I made the comment the other day, if she's not drunk, this is actually
[01:33.300 --> 01:34.680]  really sad.
[01:34.680 --> 01:44.280]  You're watching an elderly woman disintegrate mentally right in front of your very eyes.
[01:44.280 --> 01:50.080]  But she keeps going after Trump and lying about Trump, so she wants to play hardball.
[01:50.080 --> 01:57.680]  And so the Info Wars President, much like Info Wars, decided to put out a video of Nancy
[01:57.680 --> 02:02.560]  and said, stammering Nancy so crazy.
[02:02.560 --> 02:06.360]  And then they try to claim the video as doctored, but we'll get to that fake news story.
[02:06.360 --> 02:13.040]  Here is the clip, though, that President Trump tweeted out of crazy Nancy.
[02:13.040 --> 02:20.720]  We had a little long, took no longer on the floor custody custody of the border, the border.
[02:20.720 --> 02:28.600]  Everyone, they started making, sending signals, the US, Mexico, Canada, if that's not the
[02:28.600 --> 02:35.800]  accurate, some people call it after NAFTA, some call it NAFTA 2.0, working together to
[02:35.800 --> 02:37.680]  make past that.
[02:37.680 --> 02:52.960]  Okay, last time I checked, this is three, this, it was worse yesterday when we played
[02:52.960 --> 02:53.960]  another clip.
[02:53.960 --> 02:56.960]  She could not put a subject with a predicate in the same sentence.
[02:56.960 --> 02:57.960]  What's going on?
[02:57.960 --> 03:03.000]  You know, obviously, I'm 76 years old, she's a couple years older than I am, and we all
[03:03.000 --> 03:04.600]  age a little differently.
[03:04.600 --> 03:08.520]  My sense is she has a very big job, I think she's getting worn down, she's always a very
[03:08.520 --> 03:11.600]  neat, very proper, I think she's very an articulate judge.
[03:11.600 --> 03:13.600]  She likes her drinks neat, is that what you said?
[03:13.600 --> 03:14.600]  I think to a certain extent.
[03:14.600 --> 03:15.600]  Vodka neat, tonic neat.
[03:15.600 --> 03:17.800]  She needs to step in the background and not be out front as much.
[03:17.800 --> 03:18.800]  Which he neat, please?
[03:18.800 --> 03:20.480]  She's the point person leading the Democrats.
[03:20.480 --> 03:22.280]  Yes, Nancy Pelosi, vodka neat.
[03:22.280 --> 03:24.080]  Being actually controlled and with...
[03:24.080 --> 03:27.320]  Oh, Nancy's at the bar, yes, Grant, I'll call, neat, please.
[03:27.320 --> 03:29.320]  A radical branch of the Democratic party.
[03:29.320 --> 03:30.320]  Yeah, Nancy's here.
[03:30.320 --> 03:33.320]  Just go ahead and give her the entire handle of Everclear.
[03:33.320 --> 03:34.880]  Yeah, thank you.
[03:34.880 --> 03:35.880]  She'll be fine.
[03:35.880 --> 03:37.360]  Don't go along with her.
[03:37.360 --> 03:39.800]  So this is just the clip from Lou Dobbs.
[03:39.800 --> 03:41.640]  But okay, so you saw the video.
[03:41.640 --> 03:46.760]  So you saw the video, and she, Trump tweets out Pelosi Stammers through news conference.
[03:46.760 --> 03:51.920]  I mean, look, I mean, I don't know.
[03:51.920 --> 03:59.880]  You feel bad, you feel bad, I guess, poking fun at a deranged old lady who clearly is not
[03:59.880 --> 04:00.880]  mentally fit.
[04:00.880 --> 04:03.440]  I mean, you know, she's not all there.
[04:03.440 --> 04:06.600]  She needs really...
[04:06.600 --> 04:11.600]  We need to have drug testing for our congressmen and women is what we need.
[04:11.600 --> 04:12.600]  And it doesn't even matter.
[04:12.600 --> 04:15.440]  You can get busted, haven't cocaine or system, whatever, it doesn't matter.
[04:15.440 --> 04:17.840]  But we need to know what the hell's wrong with Nancy Pelosi.
[04:17.840 --> 04:18.960]  She's not all there.
[04:18.960 --> 04:20.840]  She's mentally gone.
[04:20.840 --> 04:21.840]  And you can see it.
[04:21.840 --> 04:25.200]  In fact, at the end of this press conference, she begins to walk off the set and she starts
[04:25.200 --> 04:27.520]  like talking to people all awkwardly.
[04:27.520 --> 04:34.600]  So either Nancy Pelosi is a severe alcoholic who hasn't been sober in decades, or I really
[04:34.600 --> 04:40.000]  honestly feel bad for this woman because she gone.
[04:40.000 --> 04:41.840]  But this is the third in line to be president.
[04:41.840 --> 04:44.480]  This is the leader of the Democrat Party.
[04:44.480 --> 04:48.360]  And then they take that video and they say, Trump doctored it.
[04:48.360 --> 04:52.160]  Can you believe the nerve of these people, Washington Post saying they doctored it to
[04:52.160 --> 04:53.560]  make Pelosi look bad?
[04:53.560 --> 04:56.040]  No, you just edit the clips together.
[04:56.040 --> 05:00.640]  It's a common tactic.
[05:00.640 --> 05:07.880]  Nourish a probiotic-friendly environment in your gut with prebiotic fiber by InfoWarsLife.

[05:21.320 --> 05:26.480]  Prebiotic fiber is soluble fiber that ferments in the gut to help feed good bacteria, which

[06:23.920 --> 06:52.000]  This is about the total rollout for complete and total censorship.
[06:52.000 --> 06:53.760]  How dangerous is InfoWars?
[06:53.760 --> 06:58.240]  What is the difference at this point between Trump's Twitter feed and InfoWars.com?
[06:58.240 --> 07:00.920]  InfoWars tells viewers that the world is out to get them.
[07:00.920 --> 07:03.160]  None of this seems to repel President Trump.
[07:03.160 --> 07:05.760]  InfoWars' content is useful to him.
[07:05.760 --> 07:08.080]  InfoWars personalities align with him.
[07:08.080 --> 07:11.960]  I want them shut down, I want them silenced, I want them muted, I think they are horrible
[07:11.960 --> 07:12.960]  for our society.
[07:12.960 --> 07:17.040]  I want them shut down, I want them silenced, I want them muted.
[07:17.040 --> 07:22.640]  These corporations are controlled by a liberal view.
[07:22.640 --> 07:26.440]  We're very focused on making sure that our recommendations and discovery surfaces aren't
[07:26.440 --> 07:30.800]  highlighting groups where people are repeatedly sharing misinformation or harmful content,
[07:30.800 --> 07:36.480]  and we're working hard to completely remove groups if they exist, primarily to violate
[07:36.480 --> 07:39.840]  our policies or do things that are dangerous.
[07:39.840 --> 07:44.200]  Grille your rules, your rules go against our values, and they are patently un-American.
[07:44.200 --> 07:49.120]  Mark Zuckerberg is not simply censoring opinions, he's prescribing which political
[07:49.120 --> 07:51.440]  opinions you're allowed to have.
[07:51.440 --> 07:54.000]  We need a digital fill of rights.
[07:54.000 --> 07:57.920]  They are becoming the public square, and they control how we interact with each other.
[07:57.920 --> 08:01.480]  And if you think that you are going to throw up your hand and say, well, they're private
[08:01.480 --> 08:05.080]  companies, you are absolutely insane, and you are part of the problem.
[08:05.080 --> 08:09.200]  You are a bad person, you should be censored off the internet, bad, yes, but get out of
[08:09.200 --> 08:10.200]  here, Alex.
[08:10.200 --> 08:13.520]  InfoWars might have been banned from Twitter, but it seems to have found a new home over
[08:13.520 --> 08:14.920]  at Trump's Twitter feed.
[08:14.920 --> 08:20.640]  President Trump's furious reaction to Facebook's action showcases that he is, I'm sorry to
[08:20.640 --> 08:23.680]  say, the InfoWars president.
[08:23.680 --> 08:28.800]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[08:28.800 --> 08:36.920]  Meanwhile, over there at CNN, ratings are way down.
[08:36.920 --> 08:45.240]  Is the InfoWars president tweets out, wow, CNN ratings are way down, record lows.
[08:45.240 --> 08:49.640]  People are getting tired of so many fake stories and anti-Trump lies.
[08:49.640 --> 08:54.880]  Chris Cuomo was rewarded for lowest morning ratings with a prime time spot, which is failing
[08:54.880 --> 09:02.520]  badly and not helping the dumbest man on television, Don LeMond.
[09:02.520 --> 09:11.000]  That wasn't all President tweeted out last night, he also said, when is Twitter going
[09:11.000 --> 09:17.400]  to allow the very popular conservative voices that it has so viciously shut down back into
[09:17.400 --> 09:22.240]  the open, it is time.
[09:22.240 --> 09:29.880]  So as we begin the Alex Jones show here today on this Friday, I've got great guests coming
[09:29.880 --> 09:38.400]  up, Dan Lyman in the second hour to talk about the May ouster and the Brexit vote.
[09:38.400 --> 09:46.560]  I've got Stefan Arneo from StefanArneo.com, hardtimestrongmen.com, joining me in the third
[09:46.560 --> 09:51.080]  hour to talk about the attack on men and toxic masculinity.
[09:51.080 --> 09:58.760]  And then Tom Pappert will be taking over in the fourth hour.
[09:58.760 --> 10:04.920]  Here is how, here is the message that needs to be conveyed to the audience today.
[10:04.920 --> 10:08.160]  And we'll get to all the news and video clips and guests and everything.
[10:08.160 --> 10:21.400]  But we're about three weeks away, maybe two, give or take, let's say two to four weeks
[10:21.400 --> 10:31.080]  away from the 2020 presidential campaign cycle, finally really hitting us.
[10:31.080 --> 10:38.880]  And then once August and September come around, it's full swing.
[10:38.880 --> 10:45.320]  And you know, I've been noticing something lately, just in general, it's been going on
[10:45.320 --> 10:46.320]  for a while.
[10:46.320 --> 10:51.680]  You notice that people just walk around with their heads down.
[10:51.680 --> 10:56.360]  You notice that they don't even look where they're going, where they're walking, they
[10:56.360 --> 10:58.640]  have no idea their surroundings, truly incredible.
[10:58.640 --> 11:03.600]  You'll see people fumble into stuff, stumble into things, walk in the wrong direction,
[11:03.600 --> 11:08.760]  get confused, almost walk into traffic, walk and almost get hit by an electric scooter.
[11:08.760 --> 11:15.560]  I mean, so people don't even look where they're going anymore.
[11:15.560 --> 11:24.360]  And the reason why I use this analogy is we need to have our heads up and on a swivel
[11:24.360 --> 11:34.240]  right now because you are a month away from the 2020 elections really getting going.
[11:34.240 --> 11:36.000]  And so what does that mean?
[11:36.000 --> 11:41.320]  That means you're going to see more domestic leftist tear and it's going to get more organized
[11:41.320 --> 11:44.560]  and then more violent once we get closer to the election.
[11:44.560 --> 11:48.960]  And it's more obvious that the Democrats have nothing.
[11:48.960 --> 11:55.040]  Once these intel agencies that put out the fake Russian collusion narrative and engaged
[11:55.040 --> 12:00.200]  in the illegal spying, once those investigations come out again before the election, the left
[12:00.200 --> 12:01.560]  is going to get wild.
[12:01.560 --> 12:07.160]  The Democrats are going to call for violence and insurrection in this country.
[12:07.160 --> 12:09.760]  You better have your head up.
[12:09.760 --> 12:13.760]  Americans better have their heads up.
[12:13.760 --> 12:16.360]  There is a national emergency.
[12:16.360 --> 12:17.760]  This is not a debate.
[12:17.760 --> 12:19.000]  It is a crisis.
[12:19.000 --> 12:20.960]  It is a humanitarian crisis.
[12:20.960 --> 12:26.400]  It is out of control what's happening at the southern border.
[12:26.400 --> 12:33.560]  And this is all going to come to a head in 2020.
[12:33.560 --> 12:36.280]  So you better have your head up.
[12:36.280 --> 12:42.520]  You better know where you're walking and you better know your surroundings or you're going
[12:42.520 --> 12:47.840]  to get run over.
[12:47.840 --> 12:58.640]  Now I also suspect we're about to see another wave of social media censorship within the
[12:58.640 --> 13:07.920]  next month because what's key is again the 2020 elections and they cannot have conservative
[13:07.920 --> 13:12.720]  voices and Trump supporters on social media.
[13:12.720 --> 13:21.240]  And so the Krasenstein brothers got kicked off ironically for using a bunch of bots.
[13:21.240 --> 13:32.920]  Now I was discussing this with some people last night and the opinion of a lot of people,
[13:32.920 --> 13:41.320]  they're connected in DC and talk to these social media people is that this is a head fake.
[13:41.320 --> 13:50.000]  They took down the Krasensteins so that they can now come after another wave of Trump supporters.
[13:50.000 --> 13:54.040]  And whether the Krasensteins were using bots, I mean maybe they were, maybe they weren't,
[13:54.040 --> 13:58.520]  the narrative is important because that's the narrative they're going to use when they
[13:58.520 --> 14:01.360]  come after all these Trump supporters.
[14:01.360 --> 14:08.400]  Remember the old, I'm not a hot Russian bot meme, they're going to come after it again
[14:08.400 --> 14:10.680]  and they're going to say bots.
[14:10.680 --> 14:17.880]  And they're going to say but we got the Krasensteins, we got Farrakhan, we got Avonetti who's now
[14:17.880 --> 14:24.520]  facing up to like 400 years in jail, nice endorsement stelter.
[14:24.520 --> 14:37.560]  So enjoy this Memorial Day weekend, enjoy the summer but you better have your head up as
[14:37.560 --> 14:43.600]  we go into 2020 because it is about to get wild.
[14:43.600 --> 14:52.120]  It is about to get wild, the censorship will increase, the illegal immigration pouring
[14:52.120 --> 14:56.680]  over the southern border is going to increase, which means the disease and the violence
[14:56.680 --> 15:02.280]  is going to increase, the leftist domestic terror is going to increase, the censorship
[15:02.280 --> 15:05.760]  is going to increase, it's all coming.
[15:05.760 --> 15:09.560]  The fake news, the attacks against Trump, the attacks against Trump supporters, it's
[15:09.560 --> 15:10.640]  all coming.
[15:10.640 --> 15:21.120]  And then also though, the investigations, the declassification better have your head up.
[15:21.120 --> 15:29.040]  And for nothing else, just to enjoy the show that you're about to witness for about the
[15:29.040 --> 15:32.640]  next year and a half.
[15:32.640 --> 15:34.920]  You thought 2016 was crazy?
[15:34.920 --> 15:42.320]  Well, it was but it will pale in comparison to what we're going to witness over the next
[15:42.320 --> 15:49.120]  year and a half, which will most likely inevitably end up with Trump being reelected, which will
[15:49.120 --> 15:54.520]  then again infuriate the left, causing them to go into more hysterics.
[15:54.520 --> 15:59.520]  Have your head up folks, it's about to get wild out there.
[15:59.520 --> 16:04.480]  Fully cooked, ready to eat bacon, I'm talking thick meaty, center cut, presidential bacon,

[16:29.360 --> 16:33.160]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S. What
[16:33.160 --> 16:38.360]  if I told you for just 54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally at heart
[16:38.360 --> 16:43.000]  and body extract, we've been helping thousands of people get back to a healthier heart, don't

[16:57.600 --> 16:58.840]  take charge of it.
[16:58.840 --> 17:03.760]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me, you don't know
[17:03.760 --> 17:09.000]  me and we'll never meet, I had a problem like you once, I drank and used to party a little
[17:09.000 --> 17:15.280]  too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life, I realized I needed help to
[17:15.280 --> 17:18.840]  fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[17:18.840 --> 17:24.040]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,

[20:03.000 --> 20:28.120]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:28.120 --> 20:32.920]  This video is just for the Jews who don't like Tommy Robinson, and especially those
[20:32.920 --> 20:37.800]  Jews who say he's anti-Semitic, because I hear it all the time, not just from fringe
[20:37.800 --> 20:42.560]  media, but from the mainstream and Jewish media as well.
[20:42.560 --> 20:47.680]  They call him a racist, a fascist, and often even a Nazi.
[20:47.680 --> 20:53.280]  Here in Australia, the Chairman of the Australian Deformation Commission, Dvir Abramovich, was
[20:53.280 --> 21:00.160]  reported in News.com.au calling Tommy Robinson a white supremacist and anti-Semite.
[21:00.160 --> 21:02.160]  So is it true?
[21:02.160 --> 21:07.160]  Well, first let's look at his close friends and work colleagues.
[21:07.160 --> 21:13.160]  We have Ezra Levan from Rebel Media, who has worked with Tommy for years now.
[21:13.160 --> 21:14.160]  Guess what?
[21:14.160 --> 21:16.160]  He's a Jew.
[21:16.160 --> 21:21.680]  His current campaign manager for today's election is a Jew.
[21:21.680 --> 21:28.560]  Right in London, one of Tommy's closest friends for many years now, is a Jew, and myself.
[21:28.560 --> 21:30.680]  I am Australia's proudest Jew.
[21:30.680 --> 21:38.560]  That's just to give you a name a few, but by the way, Dvir, from the ADC, he's never
[21:38.560 --> 21:40.320]  met Tommy in real life.
[21:40.320 --> 21:46.080]  He just likes to make headlines, and I don't blame him because that was an easy opportunity.
[21:46.080 --> 21:50.400]  The fact is, Tommy Robinson is the furthest thing from a Nazi.
[21:50.400 --> 21:52.720]  Let me give you a couple of examples.
[21:52.720 --> 21:58.240]  In November 2016, Tommy travelled to Israel to witness the conflict for himself.
[21:58.240 --> 22:01.360]  He'd want to make this trip for ages.
[22:01.360 --> 22:05.160]  When he was there, he fell in love with the people, he fell in love with the land, and
[22:05.160 --> 22:09.240]  he declared himself publicly a Zionist.
[22:09.240 --> 22:14.160]  The trip confirmed to him what he already understood about the Jihadi threat Israel
[22:14.160 --> 22:15.680]  faces on a daily basis.
[22:15.680 --> 22:22.040]  You often see Israeli flags at all these rallies, they were even present back in the EDL days.
[22:22.040 --> 22:28.720]  Next to gay flags, neither of those flags would be accepted at any real far-right event,
[22:28.720 --> 22:33.880]  which his followers and him himself love.
[22:33.880 --> 22:36.920]  The bad guys from Jihadas has never bothered Tommy Robinson.
[22:36.920 --> 22:42.200]  The former leader of Britain's racist British National Party hates Tommy because of his
[22:42.200 --> 22:48.160]  love of Israel and because he doesn't have any problem with gay people.
[22:48.160 --> 22:52.920]  Whenever you read an article on Tommy, they generally describe him as the founder of the
[22:52.920 --> 22:59.600]  EDL, just to vilify him, but they never tell you why Tommy left the EDL that he himself
[22:59.600 --> 23:00.600]  founded.
[23:00.600 --> 23:09.800]  And I will, because it's the perfect example of how not anti-Semitic Tommy really is.
[23:09.800 --> 23:14.920]  When Tommy was sent to prison, the EDL was hijacked by actual Jihadas, and Tommy wanted
[23:14.920 --> 23:16.680]  no part in it.
[23:16.680 --> 23:22.000]  He tried to push him out from within, but he couldn't, so he publicly walked away.
[23:22.000 --> 23:28.160]  Now, just imagine how much easier it would have been for Tommy to embrace anti-Semitism
[23:28.160 --> 23:33.560]  at the time, but he didn't because he's not what they call him.
[23:33.560 --> 23:35.600]  He is not an anti-Semite.
[23:35.600 --> 23:41.600]  He has always stood on principle, no matter the personal cost, and we know, boy, the personal
[23:41.600 --> 23:47.240]  cost has often been extremely, extremely high.
[23:47.240 --> 23:51.840]  The media also love to define Tommy as a violent, convicted criminal.
[23:51.840 --> 24:00.720]  Again, just to smear him, but they don't tell you that Tommy has never ever been charged
[24:00.720 --> 24:04.800]  with any race-related or hate-related crimes.
[24:04.800 --> 24:10.360]  Most of his criminal history has literally been trumped up charges designed to silence
[24:10.360 --> 24:11.360]  him.
[24:11.360 --> 24:14.040]  He's still dealing with that type of persecution today.
[24:14.040 --> 24:18.080]  I was in court with him last week.
[24:18.080 --> 24:22.200]  When the media include the word violent in their description, they don't explain the
[24:22.200 --> 24:24.760]  charge, so let me tell you what really happened.
[24:24.760 --> 24:31.640]  One of his rallies, a real, proud, Hitler-loving neo-Nazi attend.
[24:31.640 --> 24:36.400]  When Tommy saw the man in the crowd, he asked him, he asked the scumbag, believe, as Tommy
[24:36.400 --> 24:37.400]  does.
[24:37.400 --> 24:41.280]  When he refused to leave, Tommy walked up to him and knocked him out.
[24:41.280 --> 24:47.040]  Now, I'm not going to sit here and condone violence, but as a Jew, when I hear about
[24:47.040 --> 24:53.120]  someone that not only stands with me in theory and my people in theory, but when we're not
[24:53.120 --> 24:56.400]  even around, he will literally fight for us.
[24:56.400 --> 24:58.720]  It makes me feel protected.
[24:58.720 --> 25:06.240]  The truth is, if you really want to understand how Tommy ever managed to be labelled an anti-Semite,
[25:06.240 --> 25:09.000]  look no further than the people who created that narrative.
[25:09.000 --> 25:15.760]  Far-left organisations often create narratives based on falsehoods to smear people of influence
[25:15.760 --> 25:17.960]  that don't share their outlook on life.
[25:17.960 --> 25:20.240]  It doesn't only happen to Tommy.
[25:20.240 --> 25:25.320]  In fact, it happens to me all the time.
[25:25.320 --> 25:29.000]  Take a look at this site, for example.
[25:29.000 --> 25:35.680]  This so-called Jewish organisation published this article seven-plus times Aviamini consorted
[25:35.680 --> 25:36.680]  with neo-Nazis.
[25:36.680 --> 25:40.280]  Now, the article is full of baseless lies.
[25:40.280 --> 25:46.760]  I've never even met most of the people listed here, and the ones I have are either not-Nazis,
[25:46.760 --> 25:52.640]  for example, Milo, who also happens to be a Jew, just the wrong type of Jew for them,
[25:52.640 --> 25:57.680]  or it's just some random guy I didn't know who walked up to me, shook my hand, snapped,
[25:57.680 --> 26:02.880]  they got a photo, and I would hardly call that consorted.
[26:02.880 --> 26:04.680]  In Australia, we have this custom.
[26:04.680 --> 26:07.960]  If someone walks up to you and puts out their hand, we shake.
[26:07.960 --> 26:14.120]  But that doesn't stop the mainstream media from republishing those lies and spreading
[26:14.120 --> 26:17.360]  the fake news from that article.
[26:17.360 --> 26:21.960]  More irony for you, this same organisation, for example, and most of the organisations
[26:21.960 --> 26:26.920]  that create these narratives aren't anti-Israel, they're the kind of people that we call in
[26:26.920 --> 26:31.160]  our community as self-hating Jews.
[26:31.160 --> 26:36.480]  If you for a second believe I, Aviamini, who volunteered to serve on the front line of
[26:36.480 --> 26:42.960]  the IDF in the Golanic Begrades, is in any way associated to Nazis, well, you my friend
[26:42.960 --> 26:44.640]  are an idiot.
[26:44.640 --> 26:45.640]  Nazis hate me.
[26:45.640 --> 26:50.120]  Just go online and read what they write about me, and guess what?
[26:50.120 --> 26:54.320]  The same goes for Tommy, but Tommy doesn't have the same defence I have.
[26:54.320 --> 26:57.480]  He's not Jewish, and he never served in the IDF.
[26:57.480 --> 27:07.240]  But as one of my closest friends, I can promise you, Tommy is our most loyal ally.
[27:07.240 --> 27:14.280]  He is what literally stands between our community and the far left, the far right and Islamic
[27:14.280 --> 27:15.280]  extremists.
[27:15.280 --> 27:20.800]  He's put his life on the line to defend Britain, and especially communities like Ailes, from
[27:20.800 --> 27:23.560]  the real threats those three groups pose.
[27:23.560 --> 27:33.280]  Now he wants to defend us in the Jew-hating EU by serving in the European Parliament.
[27:33.280 --> 27:37.960]  So I'm asking you to put your trust in him.
[27:37.960 --> 27:39.440]  Give him your vote today.
[27:39.440 --> 27:45.160]  If all you know of the man is what you've read in the mainstream newspaper, well, I
[27:45.160 --> 27:48.760]  guess you'd now understand why people hate Israel so much.
[27:48.760 --> 27:55.480]  If I relied on the mainstream media to get my info on Israel, I too would hate her with
[27:55.480 --> 27:58.680]  all my heart, but we know better.
[27:58.680 --> 28:01.320]  We know better than to take their word for it.
[28:01.320 --> 28:04.760]  We know better than to believe their fake news when it comes to Israel.
[28:04.760 --> 28:09.920]  So I'm asking you to ignore the fake news as you do with Israel and instead believe one
[28:09.920 --> 28:13.240]  of his closest friends, a proud Jew.
[28:13.240 --> 28:19.480]  Take this bloodbomber, truly rejoiceful, by helping to elect a real defender of the Jewish
[28:19.480 --> 28:20.480]  people.
[28:20.480 --> 28:25.800]  Only two weeks ago, Tommy took me to a local restaurant in Manchester called Ta'am, the
[28:25.800 --> 28:32.640]  best food so glad to see authentic Israeli food in Manchester, but what was really great
[28:32.640 --> 28:36.280]  to see there was how much the film community embraced him.
[28:36.280 --> 28:41.440]  When Tommy walked in there, every religious man with payers, cities came and shook his
[28:41.440 --> 28:42.440]  hand.
[28:42.440 --> 28:48.200]  So today, I'm going to ask all of you, on love, please share this message with all your
[28:48.200 --> 28:51.280]  family and friends, spread it around the community.
[28:51.280 --> 28:53.600]  Tell them not to waste their votes today.
[28:53.600 --> 28:56.560]  Tell them to vote Tommy Robinson.
[28:56.560 --> 28:59.560]  Huck something.
[28:59.560 --> 29:03.160]  Stocks and options trading involves financial risk and is not suitable for all investors.
[29:03.160 --> 29:06.720]  Hey guys, it's Scott Bauer here, CEO of Prosper Trading Academy.

[30:02.320 --> 30:05.120]  Mike in New Jersey, you're on the air, thanks for calling Mike.
[30:05.120 --> 30:07.840]  You are the man, Alex, I'm so glad to be talking to you.
[30:07.840 --> 30:08.840]  I'm so excited.
[30:08.840 --> 30:09.840]  I'm such a big fan.
[30:09.840 --> 30:12.040]  Ever since I've been listening, I've been buying your products.
[30:12.040 --> 30:14.600]  I got to do a shout out for the bone broth.
[30:14.600 --> 30:15.600]  The bone broth.
[30:15.600 --> 30:16.600]  The bone broth.
[30:16.600 --> 30:17.600]  The bone broth.
[30:17.600 --> 30:18.600]  The bone broth.
[30:18.600 --> 30:19.600]  The bone broth.
[30:19.600 --> 30:20.600]  The bone broth.
[30:20.600 --> 30:24.600]  It tastes like, tastes like great milkshake, you know, if you just add it to milk.
[30:24.600 --> 30:25.600]  It tastes like oval team.
[30:25.600 --> 30:26.600]  It tastes like oval team.
[30:26.600 --> 30:27.600]  It tastes like oval team.
[30:27.600 --> 30:28.600]  It tastes like oval team.
[30:28.600 --> 30:29.600]  Like good.
[30:29.600 --> 30:30.600]  Wow.
[30:30.600 --> 30:32.680]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[30:32.680 --> 30:37.080]  My daughter uses the bubblegum fluoride free toothpaste.
[30:37.080 --> 30:41.680]  I've used the super male vitality, a host of other products, so thank you so much for
[30:41.680 --> 30:42.680]  that as well.
[30:42.680 --> 30:45.200]  Brother, you're thanking me for buying the products and keeping us on air.
[30:45.200 --> 30:46.200]  I'm thanking you.
[30:46.200 --> 30:50.920]  But yes, this is the ultimate bone broth formula with the turmeric, the chocolate mushroom,
[30:50.920 --> 30:51.920]  the true bone broth.
[30:51.920 --> 30:52.920]  It is next level.
[30:52.920 --> 30:53.920]  It really is good.
[30:53.920 --> 30:54.920]  So thank you.
[30:54.920 --> 31:00.600]  I feel great since I've been taking it, thank you.
[31:00.600 --> 31:03.400]  Everybody knows that supplements are amazing.
[31:03.400 --> 31:06.040]  That what God gave us from other nature is incredible.
[31:06.040 --> 31:08.760]  That's why supplements are the biggest growing industry in the world.
[31:08.760 --> 31:10.680]  The globalists are so upset.
[31:10.680 --> 31:14.800]  The problem is people forget to take them.
[31:14.800 --> 31:18.680]  And that's why the whole industry has moved towards packets that you take in the morning
[31:18.680 --> 31:19.680]  and you take at night.
[31:19.680 --> 31:24.760]  So we looked at that, we made the very best AM and PM packets out there with an incredible

[32:00.220 --> 32:04.240]  Infowarsstore.com is how you support us and it's not like we're selling stuff you don't
[32:04.240 --> 32:05.400]  need, you don't want.
[32:05.400 --> 32:12.280]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major
[32:12.280 --> 32:13.280]  city.
[32:13.280 --> 32:16.960]  There's some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[32:16.960 --> 32:18.720]  How can I solve that problem?
[32:18.720 --> 32:23.640]  So we have air filters at infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now
[32:23.640 --> 32:32.440]  $50 off the Alexa Pure Breeze groundbreaking iron cluster air filter technology.
[32:32.440 --> 32:35.320]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[32:35.320 --> 32:38.840]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[32:38.840 --> 32:43.120]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five star reviews for yourself.
[32:43.120 --> 32:45.080]  I've got two in my home.
[32:45.080 --> 32:50.240]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your
[32:50.240 --> 32:55.880]  house, don't live in a polluted major city in your home.
[32:55.880 --> 32:56.880]  Have clean air.
[32:56.880 --> 33:04.000]  Go to infowarsstore.com.
[33:04.000 --> 33:21.040]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:21.040 --> 33:22.040]  You found it.
[33:22.040 --> 33:24.040]  The tip of the spear.
[33:24.040 --> 33:29.920]  It is the Alex Jones show with Owen Troyer.
[33:29.920 --> 33:39.200]  All right, President Trump has just done a brief statement to the press on the White
[33:39.200 --> 33:40.200]  House lawn.
[33:40.200 --> 33:41.680]  I want to go to this now.
[33:41.680 --> 33:45.240]  There's a couple very important aspects to this, but I do want to say something because
[33:45.240 --> 33:48.720]  we're getting a lot of complaints that we haven't mentioned Julie Nassange.
[33:48.720 --> 33:53.280]  So we'll go ahead and just do that right now.
[33:53.280 --> 34:01.400]  Julie Nassange has been charged with 18 federal charges in a new indictment, violating the
[34:01.400 --> 34:03.400]  Espionage Act.
[34:03.400 --> 34:06.360]  This is a terrible attack on free speech.
[34:06.360 --> 34:09.400]  This is a terrible attack on the press.
[34:09.400 --> 34:17.600]  This is a terrible attack on truth, on journalism, and a shame, a shame on the federal government
[34:17.600 --> 34:21.880]  and the president of the United States if Julie Nassange gets locked up in the key thrown
[34:21.880 --> 34:22.880]  away.
[34:22.880 --> 34:25.360]  So we'll deal with him.
[34:25.360 --> 34:32.360]  And I think there needs to be cooperation both ways, but Julie Nassange does not deserve
[34:32.360 --> 34:34.440]  to rot in jail the rest of his life.
[34:34.440 --> 34:36.840]  Hillary Clinton does.
[34:36.840 --> 34:42.800]  So Nassange should not be punished for exposing the crimes of Hillary Clinton, but we'll talk
[34:42.800 --> 34:43.800]  about that later.
[34:43.800 --> 34:48.640]  Maybe take some calls on that, but listen to what the president is going to say in this
[34:48.640 --> 34:53.480]  clip, there's actually, he says some good things and he says something that I'm not
[34:53.480 --> 34:59.640]  so happy about, but well, just take a listen for yourself.
[34:59.640 --> 35:01.640]  Very transparent.
[35:01.640 --> 35:08.160]  So as you know, I declassified everything, everything they want.
[35:08.160 --> 35:11.480]  I put it under the auspices of the Attorney General.
[35:11.480 --> 35:13.320]  He's going to be in charge of it.
[35:13.320 --> 35:17.200]  He's a great gentleman and a highly respected man.
[35:17.200 --> 35:23.040]  So everything that they need is declassified and they'll be able to see how this hoax,
[35:23.040 --> 35:27.600]  how the hoax or witch hunt started and why it started.
[35:27.600 --> 35:33.760]  It was a, an attempted coup or an attempted take down of the president of the United States.
[35:33.760 --> 35:36.720]  It should never, ever happen to anybody else.
[35:36.720 --> 35:37.720]  So it's very important.
[35:37.720 --> 35:42.720]  Now people have been asking me to declassify for a long period of time.
[35:42.720 --> 35:47.160]  I've decided to do it and you're going to learn a lot.
[35:47.160 --> 35:50.200]  I hope it's going to be nice, but perhaps it won't be.
[35:50.200 --> 35:52.880]  I wasn't right there.
[35:52.880 --> 36:00.800]  Now we'll get to what he's about to say after this.
[36:00.800 --> 36:08.320]  So here's what you're going to find out and we already know it.
[36:08.320 --> 36:16.440]  The Barack Obama administration was illegally spying on Donald Trump's campaign.
[36:16.440 --> 36:22.480]  They needed an excuse for the illegal spying when it became a reality that Trump might
[36:22.480 --> 36:25.960]  actually win and Hillary couldn't get in there to cover up their crimes.
[36:25.960 --> 36:29.520]  So they had to make up Russian collusion.
[36:29.520 --> 36:39.040]  They then colluded with British intelligence using Fusion GPS and Perkins Kui as the financial
[36:39.040 --> 36:47.880]  conduit for Hillary Clinton to make up false Russian intelligence known as the Trump dossier,
[36:47.880 --> 36:59.840]  which was according to Steele and Mueller even came from five Russian intelligence sources.
[36:59.840 --> 37:04.160]  Now whether you trust those Russian intelligence sources are irrelevant.
[37:04.160 --> 37:06.480]  There's your Russian collusion, but it's all fake.
[37:06.480 --> 37:08.040]  It's all manufactured.
[37:08.040 --> 37:14.520]  It was a cover up of the illegal spy.
[37:14.520 --> 37:20.640]  And so it's all going to come out, people are cooperating, and you're going to find
[37:20.640 --> 37:27.440]  out that they used the dossier for the FISA warrants to illegally spy, and they knew it
[37:27.440 --> 37:30.120]  was bad intelligence.
[37:30.120 --> 37:34.200]  And that'll be the narrative, which is kind of a softball, because the real narrative
[37:34.200 --> 37:44.280]  is Barack Obama and his cohorts in the CIA, in the FBI, in the DOJ, probably in the NSA,
[37:44.280 --> 37:50.000]  maybe in the FISA courts, committed treason.
[37:50.000 --> 37:59.560]  Now Trump has alluded to this multiple times about the treason.
[37:59.560 --> 38:06.760]  The real question is, what are the American people going to do and think and say when all
[38:06.760 --> 38:12.320]  of this comes out?
[38:12.320 --> 38:20.520]  Because I don't think the president goes after Obama unless he knows the public has his back
[38:20.520 --> 38:23.320]  if he does so.
[38:23.320 --> 38:37.040]  But you know, Trump's biggest problem is he is one man against an entire infrastructure
[38:37.040 --> 38:41.480]  of corruption.
[38:41.480 --> 38:53.160]  One man against an entire infrastructure of corruption and treason.
[38:53.160 --> 38:58.680]  So that's good news for Americans, but it comes with the bad news on Assange.
[38:58.680 --> 39:02.680]  So good news, we're going to get the declassification, we're going to see all the crimes the Obama
[39:02.680 --> 39:07.320]  administration would came to the illegal spying on Donald Trump and the treasonous coup that
[39:07.320 --> 39:10.360]  Obama and his cohorts engaged in.
[39:10.360 --> 39:16.520]  Bad news is, right now, Julian Assange, great journalist, is looking at life in jail.
[39:16.520 --> 39:24.480]  Now let's go back to the president for what in my mind is more bad news.
[39:24.480 --> 39:29.160]  We want to have protection, the Middle East, we're going to be sending a relatively small
[39:29.160 --> 39:35.920]  number of troops, mostly protective, and some very talented people are going to the Middle
[39:35.920 --> 39:43.720]  East right now, and we'll see how, and we'll see what happens.
[39:43.720 --> 39:46.760]  So I think he's about to go on.
[39:46.760 --> 39:54.320]  So we're about to send thousands of troops to the Middle East to what?
[39:54.320 --> 40:01.920]  Protect Israel, puff our chest out against Iran and China because the military-industrial
[40:01.920 --> 40:05.480]  complex, because we want to, because we're getting ready to stage, or somebody's getting
[40:05.480 --> 40:09.640]  ready to stage a false flag in Syria, we need to have ground forces ready to invade.
[40:09.640 --> 40:11.880]  I don't know, none of it's good news.
[40:11.880 --> 40:18.860]  We have a damn invasion on our southern border right now, an invasion, and we're sending
[40:18.860 --> 40:22.160]  troops to the Middle East.
[40:22.160 --> 40:31.800]  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, that's not a priority right now.
[40:31.800 --> 40:42.320]  That's not why we elected Trump, but again, this is one man going against an entire infrastructure
[40:42.320 --> 40:55.320]  of corruption that has been growing and metastasizing for decades, decades.
[40:55.320 --> 41:00.760]  And you can tell, President's picking and choosing his battles.
[41:00.760 --> 41:04.920]  He said he wanted to get all the troops out of the Middle East, well, hasn't really gone
[41:04.920 --> 41:09.800]  so smoothly, and he even had to call out the military-industrial complex on air.
[41:09.800 --> 41:13.560]  So just get ready in the next week or two, you'll have more troops over there, they'll
[41:13.560 --> 41:18.360]  fire off a couple million dollars worth of rockets, weapons manufacturers will get rich,
[41:18.360 --> 41:26.120]  Wall Street will get rich, military-industrial complex rolls on, and that's how the story
[41:26.120 --> 41:33.840]  goes in the big game of war, a world racket.
[41:33.840 --> 41:39.760]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to take a break here.
[41:39.760 --> 41:43.640]  In this four-minute break, please go to infowarstore.com now.

[47:03.600 --> 47:17.120]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:17.120 --> 47:39.520]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[47:39.520 --> 47:40.520]  There's so much to get to.
[47:40.520 --> 47:41.520]  I don't even know where to begin.
[47:41.520 --> 47:47.760]  There's more video clips, but let me just get into some news here.
[47:47.760 --> 47:51.520]  I'm just going to pick a stack and I'm just going to dive in.
[47:51.520 --> 47:54.400]  Look at the total hypocrisy right now of the Democrat Party.
[47:54.400 --> 47:56.800]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[47:56.800 --> 48:00.120]  This comes from Adam Schiff.
[48:00.120 --> 48:04.440]  He tweets out, while Trump stonewalls the public from learning the truth about his obstruction
[48:04.440 --> 48:07.760]  of justice, he literally just announced he's going to declassify everything he penciled
[48:07.760 --> 48:09.240]  that freak.
[48:09.240 --> 48:13.120]  Trump and Barr conspired to weaponize law enforcement and classified information against
[48:13.120 --> 48:14.120]  their political enemies.
[48:14.120 --> 48:21.680]  Now, do you realize the hyperbole here?
[48:21.680 --> 48:30.000]  That is quite literally what Obama did, and it's all on record.
[48:30.000 --> 48:34.240]  He says the coverups have entered a new dangerous phase that's un-American.
[48:34.240 --> 48:35.360]  So here's Adam Schiff.
[48:35.360 --> 48:44.640]  He knows damn well, man.
[48:44.640 --> 48:51.400]  I just remember a little tweet from Donald Trump about Adam Schiff, about little Adam
[48:51.400 --> 48:54.520]  Schiff.
[48:54.520 --> 49:01.600]  How can Adam Schiff be such a corrupt, lying dirtbag?
[49:01.600 --> 49:11.360]  How can somebody be projecting in such an extreme manner?
[49:11.360 --> 49:15.320]  What's in Adam Schiff's closet?
[49:15.320 --> 49:18.680]  What does Adam Schiff do behind closed doors?
[49:18.680 --> 49:28.240]  Who does Adam Schiff like to hang out with in Hollywood?
[49:28.240 --> 49:35.320]  So here you have Obama and his cohorts caught red-handed conspiring to weaponize law enforcement.
[49:35.320 --> 49:38.920]  It's all about to be declassified, and Adam Schiff says that it's Trump and Barr that
[49:38.920 --> 49:43.720]  did it.
[49:43.720 --> 49:49.320]  What does Adam Schiff do behind closed doors, ladies and gentlemen, that he has to be such
[49:49.320 --> 49:56.360]  a bold-faced liar because he's so afraid that he may be discovered?
[49:56.360 --> 50:00.480]  Little Adam Schiff.
[50:00.480 --> 50:03.720]  So you've been seeing the Trump and Pelosi spat.
[50:03.720 --> 50:07.720]  In fact, let's go to some of these videos.
[50:07.720 --> 50:10.920]  Trump-Pelosi trade insults as their feud heats up.
[50:10.920 --> 50:15.880]  Washington Post says, faked Pelosi videos slowed to make her appear drunk, spread across social
[50:15.880 --> 50:16.880]  media.
[50:16.880 --> 50:26.600]  No, no, people edit the videos and then just compilation style put it together.
[50:26.600 --> 50:30.280]  That's not doctoring the videos, nobody's slowing anything down.
[50:30.280 --> 50:33.600]  And quite frankly, I hope Pelosi's drunk.
[50:33.600 --> 50:39.480]  NBC News, in latest attack, Trump tweets edited video of Pelosi tripping over words.
[50:39.480 --> 50:45.280]  No, it's not edited, it's the real video, they just take out clips.
[50:45.280 --> 50:48.440]  So this isn't the deception that they engage in.
[50:48.440 --> 50:56.560]  So here's Nancy Pelosi, who is either, you know, how far into dementia or Alzheimer's
[50:56.560 --> 51:00.520]  or whatever she's suffering from, or she's just a flat-out drunk.
[51:00.520 --> 51:05.440]  I mean, take your pick.
[51:05.440 --> 51:11.680]  And then you have President Trump, who's clearly with it, drug-free, never had a drop of alcohol,
[51:11.680 --> 51:15.240]  and they're going to sit here and point the finger at him, a bunch of pill-popping drug
[51:15.240 --> 51:20.240]  addicts.
[51:20.240 --> 51:25.320]  You know, I was actually really, I'm actually really proud of two young conservatives right
[51:25.320 --> 51:26.400]  now.
[51:26.400 --> 51:33.120]  One of them works for us, Caitlyn Bennett, drug-free her whole life, she's 23 years
[51:33.120 --> 51:40.960]  old, CJ Pearson, young conservative from, I think he's from Georgia or Alabama, somewhere
[51:40.960 --> 51:49.040]  in the South, maybe Louisiana, believe he's 17, 18 years old, drug-free, smart as a whip.
[51:49.040 --> 51:54.040]  There isn't a damn Democrat in this Congress or a damn Democrat voter, I bet you they
[51:54.040 --> 51:55.040]  could say that.
[51:55.040 --> 51:59.760]  I know I couldn't say it, hell, I probably couldn't have said it when I was 16 years
[51:59.760 --> 52:00.760]  old.
[52:00.760 --> 52:04.520]  But you notice that we don't uplift those people.
[52:04.520 --> 52:05.600]  Who do we uplift?
[52:05.600 --> 52:10.560]  We uplift the drug addicts, we uplift the alcoholics, we uplift the degenerative behavior.
[52:10.560 --> 52:17.240]  But if you're an actual solid human being with a good foundation that's drug-free, eh.
[52:17.240 --> 52:20.840]  People make fun of you for that, you're a square.
[52:20.840 --> 52:25.440]  But getting back to the important matters, the fact that they sit here and they point
[52:25.440 --> 52:29.440]  the finger at Trump for being mentally unstable is so laughable.
[52:29.440 --> 52:37.760]  But the average American is in a trance, not paying attention, has no idea, totally deceived
[52:37.760 --> 52:38.760]  by the media.
[52:38.760 --> 52:42.640]  And they actually see this and they're like, oh, Trump's doctoring video to make Pelosi
[52:42.640 --> 52:43.640]  look bad.
[52:43.640 --> 52:45.640]  Oh my gosh, how dare he?
[52:45.640 --> 52:50.440]  No, Pelosi needs to be removed from office.
[52:50.440 --> 52:54.080]  She's either dead drunk or suffering from dementia.
[52:54.080 --> 52:56.200]  This is not a joke.
[52:56.200 --> 52:57.200]  This is not a joke.
[52:57.200 --> 52:59.240]  In fact, let's go to the video clips.
[52:59.240 --> 53:03.880]  First let's go to Trump in clip eight.
[53:03.880 --> 53:09.920]  Again, this is just calling it like it is, folks, Nancy Pelosi is disintegrating before
[53:09.920 --> 53:10.920]  our eyes.
[53:10.920 --> 53:34.880]  She doesn't understand it and they sort of feel she's disintegrating before the rise.
[53:34.880 --> 53:36.000]  She does not understand it.
[53:36.000 --> 53:39.920]  They want to have her understand it before we, it's finished, it's signed.
[53:39.920 --> 53:46.160]  As you know, Mexico has approved the deal, Canada has approved the deal, and they're
[53:46.160 --> 53:48.600]  waiting to get a signal for her.
[53:48.600 --> 53:53.840]  Now, I would say this, the farmers should start talking to the Democrats in the House.
[53:53.840 --> 53:56.240]  The Senate's ready to approve it, the Republican Senate.
[53:56.240 --> 54:01.480]  But the Democrat House is not, Pelosi does not understand the bill.
[54:01.480 --> 54:02.720]  She doesn't understand it.
[54:02.720 --> 54:08.440]  Even though unions are in favor of it, farmers, everybody just about is in favor of it.
[54:08.440 --> 54:12.200]  Let's say replacement for, as I said, the worst trade deal ever made.
[54:12.200 --> 54:15.880]  So she's got to get up to snuff, learn the bill.
[54:15.880 --> 54:18.980]  And by the way, I think she wants to approve it, I think.
[54:18.980 --> 54:23.640]  But so Bob Lighthizer, who you can speak to if you want, he's waiting to get the okay
[54:23.640 --> 54:25.040]  from her to send it in.
[54:25.040 --> 54:28.200]  So he goes on and talks about this.
[54:28.200 --> 54:32.840]  One of the great crew here makes a joke, says the video of Nancy Pelosi isn't doctored,
[54:32.840 --> 54:33.840]  she needs a doctor.
[54:33.840 --> 54:35.640]  No, look, here's the deal.
[54:35.640 --> 54:39.360]  I mean, she's in the political arena, I feel bad.
[54:39.360 --> 54:41.400]  She's what, like 79 or something?
[54:41.400 --> 54:43.240]  She's clearly losing it.
[54:43.240 --> 54:47.160]  Every press conference and speech she gives now, she's slowly and slowly disintegrating
[54:47.160 --> 54:49.440]  before our eyes, as Trump said.
[54:49.440 --> 54:50.960]  She's whacked out.
[54:50.960 --> 54:52.200]  I want to know what her deal is.
[54:52.200 --> 54:54.760]  I want to know what drugs is she on?
[54:54.760 --> 54:59.720]  She's clearly on some pharmaceutical drugs, or is she just dead drunk all the time?
[54:59.720 --> 55:00.720]  And I don't care.
[55:00.720 --> 55:03.320]  I mean, you can be dead drunk and be a congressman, fine.
[55:03.320 --> 55:05.240]  You can do cocaine all day and be a congressman.
[55:05.240 --> 55:06.880]  Honestly, I don't care.
[55:06.880 --> 55:11.760]  If people want to vote a meth head in, if people want to vote a meth head in, then they can
[55:11.760 --> 55:14.240]  do that.
[55:14.240 --> 55:18.240]  But you see, they make Trump release his physicals.
[55:18.240 --> 55:20.840]  They make Trump's doctor put out a national statement.
[55:20.840 --> 55:22.840]  They attack Trump for his mental health.
[55:22.840 --> 55:24.480]  They say Trump's unstable.
[55:24.480 --> 55:25.960]  And then what do they give you?
[55:25.960 --> 55:30.600]  Bumbling, fumbling, can't keep her dentures in her mouth, can't keep her eyes open, can't
[55:30.600 --> 55:44.080]  count to three, can't even remember who the president is, Nancy Pelosi.
[55:44.080 --> 55:53.800]  You know, they believe that the first wave of AI robots are going to be used to help
[55:53.800 --> 56:04.480]  elderly people in homes, Nancy, I think it's time.
[56:04.480 --> 56:10.760]  I think it's time, Nancy, but here's Nancy either clearly drunk or whacked out of her
[56:10.760 --> 56:15.320]  head on pills because she's suffering from dementia.
[56:15.320 --> 56:18.760]  And nobody is going to call her on this except the president.
[56:18.760 --> 56:21.320]  The media is not going to call her on this.
[56:21.320 --> 56:24.840]  The Democrats aren't going to look at her and say, that's the leader of the Democrat
[56:24.840 --> 56:26.880]  party.
[56:26.880 --> 56:31.240]  One flew over the cuckoo's nest.
[56:31.240 --> 56:37.160]  In fact, I'll make a prediction right now.
[56:37.160 --> 56:43.240]  There's going to be a moment where Nancy Pelosi is in a press conference or something and
[56:43.240 --> 56:44.760]  she's going to just totally fall apart.
[56:44.760 --> 56:48.320]  Now, I don't know what that means because she was on the verge yesterday.
[56:48.320 --> 56:55.520]  I mean, she was bumbling, fumbling, I mean, couldn't count to three halfway walked off
[56:55.520 --> 56:57.840]  the stage and then started like rambling.
[56:57.840 --> 57:04.080]  I mean, these are the ramblings of a drunken old Haggard.
[57:04.080 --> 57:09.840]  It's just ridiculous that this is what we deal with.
[57:09.840 --> 57:10.840]  All right.
[57:10.840 --> 57:13.680]  Now, on the other side in the second hour, Dan Lyman is going to be joining me.
[57:13.680 --> 57:18.760]  We're going to be discussing the Brexit vote that just happened and the ouster of Theresa
[57:18.760 --> 57:21.600]  May in the UK.
[57:21.600 --> 57:24.240]  Folks, please go to infowarstore.com in this break.
[57:24.240 --> 57:25.240]  I barely even plug this hour.
[57:25.240 --> 57:28.840]  We need your support at infowarstore.com.
[57:28.840 --> 57:33.280]  They're going to have a big wave of censorship, folks, and infowar's platform is going to
[57:33.280 --> 57:38.880]  be even more important so that voices can come on here and have free speech.
[57:38.880 --> 57:42.600]  So please support infowar, support free speech, go to infowarstore.com.
[57:42.600 --> 57:45.520]  Take advantage of the massive Memorial Day sale.
[57:45.520 --> 57:49.920]  You won't believe these savings at infowarstore.com.
[57:49.920 --> 57:56.640]  Recent studies and reports have shown that pipes and plumbing are getting clogged and
[57:56.640 --> 58:00.760]  backed up with human waste and debris.
[58:00.760 --> 58:06.440]  This is from people flushing things that aren't meant to be flushed like baby wipes and feminine
[58:06.440 --> 58:09.600]  products and safe sex products.
[58:09.600 --> 58:13.800]  So this is resulting in pipes being backed up and clogged.
[58:13.800 --> 58:19.000]  Well, just like plumbing gets clogged and just like pipes get clogged, the human body
[58:19.000 --> 58:22.920]  gets clogged just like that and you may be experiencing backup too.
[58:22.920 --> 58:28.920]  So if you want some relief, some explosive relief, go to infowarstore.com and get oxypowder.
[58:28.920 --> 58:32.080]  But let me warn you, this stuff is no joke.
[58:32.080 --> 58:39.440]  If you're experiencing some cloggage, some backup of your own, oxypowder from infowarstore.com
[58:39.440 --> 58:42.520]  will clear it out guaranteed.
[58:42.520 --> 59:11.360]  So go to infowarstore.com, take care of your clogged plumbing with oxypowder.
[59:11.360 --> 59:16.960]  People who ate certain quail eggs experience less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[59:16.960 --> 59:21.600]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the
[59:21.600 --> 59:27.080]  fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[59:27.080 --> 59:28.080]  symptoms.
[59:28.080 --> 59:30.640]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[59:30.640 --> 59:31.640]  It is not an antihistamine.
[59:31.640 --> 59:36.560]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[59:36.560 --> 59:42.360]  triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[59:42.360 --> 59:45.040]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[59:45.040 --> 1:00:10.040]  Get to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[1:00:15.040 --> 1:00:25.280]  All right, Dan Lyman is about to join me to talk about the Brexit, the Theresa May ouster.
[1:00:25.280 --> 1:00:30.360]  But first, Theresa May gave her resignation speech, I believe, yes, it's June 7th is
[1:00:30.360 --> 1:00:32.080]  the final day.
[1:00:32.080 --> 1:00:36.760]  And well, it wasn't too pretty for Theresa May today.
[1:00:36.760 --> 1:00:41.400]  Here is that clip of her resigning.
[1:00:41.400 --> 1:00:48.400]  I will shortly leave the job that it has been the honor of my life to hold the second female
[1:00:48.400 --> 1:00:52.800]  Prime Minister, but certainly not the last.
[1:00:52.800 --> 1:01:00.960]  I do so with no ill will, but with enormous and enduring gratitude to have had the opportunity
[1:01:00.960 --> 1:01:05.000]  to serve the country I love.
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:16.840]  Yeah, you know, actually, a lot of people are saying that the reason why she stepped down
[1:01:16.840 --> 1:01:23.280]  is because the MI6 and MI5 involvement in the fake Russian collusion narrative is about
[1:01:23.280 --> 1:01:24.520]  to come out.
[1:01:24.520 --> 1:01:27.520]  And she just doesn't want to be around.
[1:01:27.520 --> 1:01:31.680]  So they kind of just shuffled her aside.
[1:01:31.680 --> 1:01:33.880]  So there she goes.
[1:01:33.880 --> 1:01:37.880]  She didn't do one of those awkward dance moves off the stage, though.
[1:01:37.880 --> 1:01:38.880]  That's too bad.
[1:01:38.880 --> 1:01:42.600]  We could have we could have used one of the worst dance moves in the history of humanity
[1:01:42.600 --> 1:01:45.240]  one more time before she finally resigned.
[1:01:45.240 --> 1:01:50.040]  But that's Skeletor creature finally ousted, I guess will be June 7th.
[1:01:50.040 --> 1:01:51.880]  So what damage will she cause in the next two weeks?
[1:01:51.880 --> 1:01:53.160]  We'll find out.
[1:01:53.160 --> 1:01:59.400]  Here is Nigel Farage responding to the results of the vote.
[1:01:59.400 --> 1:02:04.520]  She said she would step aside as leader of the Conservative Party June the 7th, but remain
[1:02:04.520 --> 1:02:06.760]  as Prime Minister until a successor is chosen.
[1:02:06.760 --> 1:02:13.200]  Joining us now on the phone, Nigel Farage, right Nigel, Brexit has taken out two Prime
[1:02:13.200 --> 1:02:14.400]  Ministers.
[1:02:14.400 --> 1:02:16.680]  How many more do you think?
[1:02:16.680 --> 1:02:20.560]  Well that's a very good question and don't forget we're going to get on Sunday night,
[1:02:20.560 --> 1:02:25.080]  we will get the results of the European election that were contested yesterday and the polls
[1:02:25.080 --> 1:02:31.360]  are showing that so the Conservative Party under Theresa May will not even achieve 10%
[1:02:31.360 --> 1:02:37.560]  in those elections, whereas the Brexit Party, which I set up six weeks ago today, is projected
[1:02:37.560 --> 1:02:38.560]  to get 35%.
[1:02:38.560 --> 1:02:43.520]  So you can see that in their millions, voters have deserted the Conservative Party.
[1:02:43.520 --> 1:02:46.920]  They come to my new vehicle because they want Brexit delivered.
[1:02:46.920 --> 1:02:49.720]  So this then poses a very big question.
[1:02:49.720 --> 1:02:52.040]  What ticket does Boris Johnson run on?
[1:02:52.040 --> 1:02:57.160]  Is he going to be clear, unequivocal about the fact we absolutely have to leave the
[1:02:57.160 --> 1:02:58.160]  EU this year?
[1:02:58.160 --> 1:03:03.440]  If he is, then well, maybe there's someone there that we can talk to and perhaps do business
[1:03:03.440 --> 1:03:04.440]  with.
[1:03:04.440 --> 1:03:09.240]  If not, I think you could be witnessing the death of a political party that has dominated
[1:03:09.240 --> 1:03:10.880]  the UK for over 200 years.
[1:03:10.880 --> 1:03:13.480]  Alright Nigel, we'll leave it at that.
[1:03:13.480 --> 1:03:17.240]  Good luck in the elections which are still taking place for the European Parliament.
[1:03:17.240 --> 1:03:21.560]  Get back to us soon about those results Nigel and we will talk to you later.
[1:03:21.560 --> 1:03:22.560]  Thanks Nigel.
[1:03:22.560 --> 1:03:23.560]  See you soon.
[1:03:23.560 --> 1:03:24.560]  Bye.
[1:03:24.560 --> 1:03:31.920]  So this is the just absolute rejection of globalism worldwide but you have to understand if or
[1:03:31.920 --> 1:03:39.040]  when Britain leaves the EU, the EU is pretty much done because everybody's going to want
[1:03:39.040 --> 1:03:42.240]  to pull out of the EU after that.
[1:03:42.240 --> 1:03:47.680]  Italy will want to pull out, Spain will want to pull out and it'll just go on and on and
[1:03:47.680 --> 1:03:56.280]  on until you have nobody left but like Brussels and Germany.
[1:03:56.280 --> 1:03:59.600]  And that's why they can't have it.
[1:03:59.600 --> 1:04:08.000]  Because the EU was the foundation of globalism by design.
[1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:16.400]  You bring in the EU, you use it as an example for the West to take nation states sovereignty
[1:04:16.400 --> 1:04:27.840]  and take it from them as nation states and then give it to the larger body of a one government
[1:04:27.840 --> 1:04:32.800]  system in control of all the nation states.
[1:04:32.800 --> 1:04:37.920]  But you see as soon as you vote to get out of that and people see it, they're going to
[1:04:37.920 --> 1:04:41.400]  want out too.
[1:04:41.400 --> 1:04:46.240]  That's why they haven't let Britain leave.
[1:04:46.240 --> 1:04:54.120]  But if Britain leaves the EU, the EU will be dead within 10 years because nobody else
[1:04:54.120 --> 1:05:00.280]  will want to stay.
[1:05:00.280 --> 1:05:03.000]  Mike in New Jersey, you're on the air, thanks for calling Mike.
[1:05:03.000 --> 1:05:07.560]  You are the man Alex, I'm so glad to be talking to you, I'm so excited, I'm such a big fan.
[1:05:07.560 --> 1:05:11.440]  Ever since I've been listening, I've been buying your products, I got to do a shout out for
[1:05:11.440 --> 1:05:12.440]  the bone broth.
[1:05:12.440 --> 1:05:18.160]  The bone broth, the bone broth, the bone broth, the bone broth.
[1:05:18.160 --> 1:05:22.640]  Tastes like, tastes like great milkshake, you know, if you just add it to milk.
[1:05:22.640 --> 1:05:27.240]  It tastes like oval theme, it tastes like oval theme, it tastes like oval theme, like
[1:05:27.240 --> 1:05:28.240]  good.
[1:05:28.240 --> 1:05:30.520]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[1:05:30.520 --> 1:05:34.920]  My daughter uses the bubblegum fluoride free toothpaste.
[1:05:34.920 --> 1:05:39.560]  I've used the supermail vitality, a host of other products, so thank you so much for
[1:05:39.560 --> 1:05:40.560]  that as well.

[1:05:52.160 --> 1:06:03.800]  I feel great since I've been taking it, thank you.

[1:07:54.240 --> 1:07:56.600]  and then bring them on to the show to discuss it.
[1:07:56.600 --> 1:08:02.680]  So Dan Lyman joins me now, the latest poll shows Europeans strongly oppose mass migration,
[1:08:02.680 --> 1:08:07.960]  EU's handling of crisis and Dan really this poll I think reflects kind of every other
[1:08:07.960 --> 1:08:16.720]  poll that is anti-globalism, anti-open borders and back towards nationalism and state sovereignty.
[1:08:16.720 --> 1:08:21.080]  That's absolutely correct when things is definitely very interesting this weekend, obviously
[1:08:21.080 --> 1:08:26.040]  we have the elections, we've had the UK and Netherlands went to the polls yesterday, the
[1:08:26.040 --> 1:08:32.160]  Czechs and Ireland are in the polls today, tomorrow I believe Slovakia goes to the polls
[1:08:32.160 --> 1:08:36.920]  and then on Sunday everyone else will head to the polls and cast their votes for the
[1:08:36.920 --> 1:08:41.800]  European Parliament and by Sunday night we'll start getting unofficial election results
[1:08:41.800 --> 1:08:46.520]  and of course we've had some exit polling that kind of indicates where things are headed
[1:08:46.520 --> 1:08:50.360]  and some polling ahead of time but of course we take that all with a grain of salt because
[1:08:50.360 --> 1:08:52.400]  we never know how things are going to turn out.
[1:08:52.400 --> 1:08:56.600]  As we saw with the 2016 presidential election in the US as we saw with Brexit and even the
[1:08:56.600 --> 1:09:01.400]  recent Australian elections so polling should always be taken with a grain of salt but I
[1:09:01.400 --> 1:09:06.400]  think things do look good for the populist nationalist movements across Europe and this
[1:09:06.400 --> 1:09:12.760]  new alliance that's being formed by Matteo Salvini we see in France that the Marine
[1:09:12.760 --> 1:09:16.280]  Le Pen's party is actually leading the polls there so it's going to be a very interesting
[1:09:16.280 --> 1:09:22.240]  weekend and I do anticipate some leftist outbursts by the end of Sunday the way that they have
[1:09:22.240 --> 1:09:25.400]  in other countries when things don't go their way.
[1:09:25.400 --> 1:09:30.400]  So you are expecting these voter turnouts to show a nationalist result and you think
[1:09:30.400 --> 1:09:35.400]  they have some we'll say protest ready to go?
[1:09:35.400 --> 1:09:40.040]  Protests certainly possible today we have protests going on in Switzerland and Germany
[1:09:40.040 --> 1:09:45.600]  actually they call them climate strikes so in my town and across Switzerland and Germany
[1:09:45.600 --> 1:09:50.200]  and probably some neighboring countries as well we have some pretty radical environmentalists
[1:09:50.200 --> 1:09:57.040]  out just chanting for climate justice apparently that's a big issue in Germany especially with
[1:09:57.040 --> 1:10:02.600]  the city dwellers that they are very concerned about climate change so maybe that could sway
[1:10:02.600 --> 1:10:08.360]  the votes in Germany certainly but I don't think that that's as big of an issue continent
[1:10:08.360 --> 1:10:12.480]  wide as the press would like people to think that it is.
[1:10:12.480 --> 1:10:19.320]  When you're looking at these elections what countries do you think will be the first
[1:10:19.320 --> 1:10:23.880]  ones to go nationalist obviously you're looking at Britain right now with the Brexit but who
[1:10:23.880 --> 1:10:28.280]  do you think follows?
[1:10:28.280 --> 1:10:34.080]  In terms of who could be more dominoes to fall in the EU there's some really interesting
[1:10:34.080 --> 1:10:38.600]  things happening in Denmark right now they are really working towards hardening their
[1:10:38.600 --> 1:10:43.000]  borders one of the biggest parties they are just introduced a resolution they'd like to
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:49.880]  see a full asylum stop stop through 2025 and they want to basically solidify the borders
[1:10:49.880 --> 1:10:55.440]  between themselves in Germany and also themselves in Sweden and those kinds of things are very
[1:10:55.440 --> 1:10:59.720]  hard to accomplish unless you get the EU's permission so they've said that they want
[1:10:59.720 --> 1:11:05.800]  to move forward and introduce referendums based on the EU's internal border policy in
[1:11:05.800 --> 1:11:10.840]  the Shenzhen area so I think there's very interesting things happening in Denmark we
[1:11:10.840 --> 1:11:14.800]  have in the Netherlands the possibility that the populace take the vote there although
[1:11:14.800 --> 1:11:18.360]  that's kind of up in the air but it's definitely trending in that direction.
[1:11:18.360 --> 1:11:21.920]  Every time there's an election now in the Netherlands the press loves to say that Gert
[1:11:21.920 --> 1:11:26.520]  Vielder has fell on his face and they're still saying that even today but every election
[1:11:26.520 --> 1:11:33.200]  he seems to gain seats in the Netherlands and also on the EU stage and then also we have
[1:11:33.200 --> 1:11:38.040]  some other newcomers to the nationalist movement in the Netherlands so I don't think that the
[1:11:38.040 --> 1:11:42.280]  establishment parties there are going to fare as well as they have in the past.
[1:11:42.280 --> 1:11:47.160]  Of course in Italy things are changing dramatically under the leadership of Salvini, France things
[1:11:47.160 --> 1:11:51.560]  are changing obviously with the yellow vest protests that have been going on for quite
[1:11:51.560 --> 1:11:58.440]  some time the support is swinging in the favor of Marine Le Pen and her new party the national
[1:11:58.440 --> 1:12:02.920]  rally as of right now they are leading the polls and so those are really the big countries
[1:12:02.920 --> 1:12:08.640]  that everyone's keeping an eye on I don't think things will change too much in Germany although
[1:12:08.640 --> 1:12:15.200]  I think AFD continues to gain ground of course and then also there is talk that when Angela
[1:12:15.200 --> 1:12:23.520]  Merkel is completed with her term as Chancellor of Germany she may move into European government
[1:12:23.520 --> 1:12:27.240]  at the at the super state level so it's all interesting to see where it's all going to
[1:12:27.240 --> 1:12:28.240]  go from here for sure.
[1:12:28.240 --> 1:12:35.600]  Now does the media have the same role in these elections as they do in the West total leftist
[1:12:35.600 --> 1:12:41.000]  total globalism to try to keep the people from voting nationalist and for their own
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:42.000]  state sovereignty?
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:48.680]  Absolutely the media is just as bad here as it is in the US in some cases worse but you
[1:12:48.680 --> 1:12:53.520]  know they take all of these movements for instance the Brexit party which I would consider
[1:12:53.520 --> 1:12:58.440]  a mainstream conservative party the actual conservative party there the Tories they are
[1:12:58.440 --> 1:13:02.960]  not faring well at all obviously we just saw the Prime Minister just stepped down and their
[1:13:02.960 --> 1:13:08.040]  support is just plummeted at one of the lowest it's been in decades because I don't think
[1:13:08.040 --> 1:13:11.000]  that they're an actual conservative party they're not conserving anything in Britain
[1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:15.840]  of course Britain is going by the wayside the Brexit party would be considered at this
[1:13:15.840 --> 1:13:21.120]  point just an anti-globalist party there's all sorts of all shapes and colors of people
[1:13:21.120 --> 1:13:25.560]  running as Brexit candidates but of course they get smeared as far right and you see
[1:13:25.560 --> 1:13:30.440]  that happening across Europe and I think people are starting to become immune to that label
[1:13:30.440 --> 1:13:34.480]  they see that and they just roll their eyes the only people that really buy that now are
[1:13:34.480 --> 1:13:40.000]  just they're just they're lost anyways so the media has not done itself any service
[1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:44.520]  in Europe if you want to know what it's like just picture how much fools of themselves
[1:13:44.520 --> 1:13:48.120]  that CNN has made it of themselves in recent years and you can imagine how people are
[1:13:48.120 --> 1:13:53.720]  feeling about their particular outlets across the countries in Europe.
[1:13:53.720 --> 1:13:59.920]  Do you agree with my analysis the reason why the EU cannot have the Brexit happen is they
[1:13:59.920 --> 1:14:04.080]  realize if the Brexit happens that's the first domino to fall and then other countries are
[1:14:04.080 --> 1:14:08.680]  going to want to get out I think if Brexit happens the EU is done do you agree?
[1:14:08.680 --> 1:14:13.680]  I think absolutely it's trending in that direction it's all a matter of how they executed of
[1:14:13.680 --> 1:14:18.920]  course Farage is taking the reins again with the Brexit movement and if he can pull them
[1:14:18.920 --> 1:14:25.200]  out by sheer will and with this great surge of support behind him and his candidates then
[1:14:25.200 --> 1:14:31.240]  I think the EU is of course they're terrified of that and we saw interesting comments recently
[1:14:31.240 --> 1:14:36.880]  from John Claude Junker who is the head of the EU he basically I mean this guy just shoots
[1:14:36.880 --> 1:14:40.240]  himself in the foot I think he drinks way too much and says things that he probably
[1:14:40.240 --> 1:14:45.280]  shouldn't but he went on record with CNN saying that populist nationalists he called him stupid
[1:14:45.280 --> 1:14:49.760]  nationalists they are in love with their own countries and he was ridiculing that I don't
[1:14:49.760 --> 1:14:53.640]  think people take too well to that if they happen to catch that news and they kind of
[1:14:53.640 --> 1:15:00.800]  realize at this point that the EU is a just a power mad entity that they need to be pulling
[1:15:00.800 --> 1:15:01.800]  out of at this point.
[1:15:01.800 --> 1:15:06.840]  Well it was literally Hitler's brainchild was the EU so it's kind of ironic that that's
[1:15:06.840 --> 1:15:12.200]  where we're at here but yeah John Claude Junker says you're stupid if you're a nationalist
[1:15:12.200 --> 1:15:17.840]  so he's literally insulting people if they love their country but that's like a weird
[1:15:17.840 --> 1:15:24.280]  trend now Dan I mean you see it from journalists in the West that hate America you see it about
[1:15:24.280 --> 1:15:29.880]  in fact there was something there was I believe it was a Russian diplomat or someone just
[1:15:29.880 --> 1:15:33.480]  received an award and she gave a speech and she was like yeah I really love Russia and
[1:15:33.480 --> 1:15:39.200]  the media attacked her like oh yeah you love authoritarian Russia you love corruption you're
[1:15:39.200 --> 1:15:42.520]  a status and it's just like no she's just saying she loves her country she loves representing
[1:15:42.520 --> 1:15:46.240]  the country she's going to work hard for Russia these people want everybody to hate their country
[1:15:46.240 --> 1:15:52.080]  it's very strange that they think globalism is the answer for all of their shortcomings
[1:15:52.080 --> 1:15:57.760]  Dan Lyman from Europe Wars with us don't go anywhere.

[1:20:58.520 --> 1:21:05.680]  thank god for your support at info wars store dot com we would not be here without you and
[1:21:05.680 --> 1:21:11.600]  we've got a bunch of info warriors in town this weekend because we take action the info
[1:21:11.600 --> 1:21:17.560]  wars army and I want to apologize because I know you guys are blowing me up pretty much
[1:21:17.560 --> 1:21:24.080]  nonstop you're trying to use info comms to organize and to get in touch with people for
[1:21:24.080 --> 1:21:28.800]  the protest coming up at Planned Parenthood here on Sunday but info comms is down I don't
[1:21:28.800 --> 1:21:35.200]  know if or when it'll be back up so I apologize for that but we will be out there on Sunday
[1:21:35.200 --> 1:21:42.840]  Planned Parenthood in Austin Texas 7th Street at noon I'm giving a speech at 2 and so I'm
[1:21:42.840 --> 1:21:46.760]  looking forward to seeing you all out there sorry you can't communicate on info comms
[1:21:46.760 --> 1:21:52.000]  it's down you know we deal with a lot of sabotage here people trying to take our servers shutting
[1:21:52.000 --> 1:21:59.480]  us down obviously the censorship so I apologize if that's going on I wish it wasn't the case
[1:21:59.480 --> 1:22:04.920]  but we will be out there Sunday so this is not a sign that we're not going to be there
[1:22:04.920 --> 1:22:08.840]  this is not a sign that we're canceling the event or anything we're just dealing with
[1:22:08.840 --> 1:22:14.440]  some tech issues and you know so I don't know if info comms will be up but we're still going
[1:22:14.440 --> 1:22:17.640]  to be out there so the people asking me hey are you still going out there Sunday I can't
[1:22:17.640 --> 1:22:21.480]  see anything on info comms we are still going out there we're just dealing with some technical
[1:22:21.480 --> 1:22:27.040]  issues and so if you're if you know I get your messages about the videos not working we get
[1:22:27.040 --> 1:22:32.000]  all your messages we're trying our best here folks you can just imagine the type of sabotage
[1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:40.960]  that we have to endure now Dan Lyman it's really incredible here because globalism has
[1:22:40.960 --> 1:22:47.120]  been exposed and that was its real Achilles heel globalism had to be brought on in the
[1:22:47.120 --> 1:22:50.240]  shadows because as soon as people learned about it they didn't want it as soon as you
[1:22:50.240 --> 1:22:55.880]  have Jean-Claude Juncker saying you're stupid if you're a nationalist people started raising
[1:22:55.880 --> 1:23:01.060]  their eyebrow as soon as you had people saying you're a bigot if you're a nationalist people
[1:23:01.060 --> 1:23:07.120]  started scratching their heads so globalism has been completely unmasked the media is
[1:23:07.120 --> 1:23:12.520]  trying to keep the mask on and tell you that nationalism is the enemy I don't see it working
[1:23:12.520 --> 1:23:15.960]  right now Dan I think that Europe is going the way of the Brexit they're going to do
[1:23:15.960 --> 1:23:20.000]  everything they can to stop it but they won't be able to I think we're starting to see
[1:23:20.000 --> 1:23:26.120]  I would say if I think what would you give it if Brexit happens I think the EUs has less
[1:23:26.120 --> 1:23:31.000]  than 20 years probably what do you think I think that's certainly fair a fair assessment
[1:23:31.000 --> 1:23:36.920]  it's it's kind of unprecedented this whole situation as to how it will pan out but you
[1:23:36.920 --> 1:23:41.880]  know I mean it could happen quickly the USSR fell pretty quickly when it looked pretty
[1:23:41.880 --> 1:23:47.040]  pretty strong just a few years before so we will see how things do pan out in that regard
[1:23:47.040 --> 1:23:51.560]  but I think 20 years is definitely a very safe prediction and as you were saying about
[1:23:51.560 --> 1:23:56.960]  globalism in general that it's kind of been it's been masked and even the term globalist
[1:23:56.960 --> 1:24:01.320]  five years ago when I would use that term with normal friends they would have no idea
[1:24:01.320 --> 1:24:05.960]  what I was talking about it sounded like some crazy code word that you know some crazy Illuminati
[1:24:05.960 --> 1:24:12.040]  code word and now I mean it the word is used openly in mainstream publications by the president
[1:24:12.040 --> 1:24:16.440]  of the United States and even by you know politicians around the world in the media
[1:24:16.440 --> 1:24:21.640]  so that is out in the open and that agenda is out in the open and I kind of want to I
[1:24:21.640 --> 1:24:26.560]  want to touch a couple of stories here that give people an idea of what's going on on
[1:24:26.560 --> 1:24:32.880]  the ground that is influencing the way people feel because then the number one issue facing
[1:24:32.880 --> 1:24:39.440]  Europe and the voters will say this in general is migration and the the effects of illegal
[1:24:39.440 --> 1:24:44.920]  migration in particular and then of course terrorism is a concern in some of the countries
[1:24:44.920 --> 1:24:49.640]  economics are a big concern as well so like in Greece and Italy and Portugal especially
[1:24:49.640 --> 1:24:52.880]  with the younger folks they don't see a lot of opportunity for themselves economically
[1:24:52.880 --> 1:24:58.600]  but the the thread that runs throughout Europe is is migration and the related issues and
[1:24:58.600 --> 1:25:02.120]  so just a couple of these stories that you probably won't hear about but that's this
[1:25:02.120 --> 1:25:06.640]  is what's going on in Europe and in the individual countries people are paying attention to this
[1:25:06.640 --> 1:25:12.120]  stuff and it's influencing votes for sure so just a few minutes ago earlier today a bomb
[1:25:12.120 --> 1:25:16.000]  just went off in Leon France they're still getting information about that but it's a
[1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:20.200]  parcel bomb they're calling it an attack and at least eight people were injured including
[1:25:20.200 --> 1:25:25.320]  a child so that's just like one little snapshot of what happened in France today right before
[1:25:25.320 --> 1:25:29.120]  they go to the polls so you know that's going to influence a few people in Leon when they
[1:25:29.120 --> 1:25:33.600]  head to the polls maybe nationwide that's one example another example is that in the
[1:25:33.600 --> 1:25:39.080]  Netherlands the the the migration minister just had to resign in the middle of a scandal
[1:25:39.080 --> 1:25:45.680]  because it was uncovered that that the that the immigration ministry was hiding details
[1:25:45.680 --> 1:25:50.600]  about crimes being committed by migrants and that was unearthed actually by the telegraph
[1:25:50.600 --> 1:25:55.280]  which is a mainstream publication they discovered that the figures that were being put out were
[1:25:55.280 --> 1:26:02.160]  masking really heinous crimes such as rape murder child abuse child sexual abuse by migrants
[1:26:02.160 --> 1:26:07.080]  and and this all came out just a couple days ago and the migration minister had to step
[1:26:07.080 --> 1:26:13.280]  down that has rocked Dutch politics this week right before they headed to the polls so of
[1:26:13.280 --> 1:26:17.960]  course that's going to affect some votes another thing that happened is in Belgium one of we've
[1:26:17.960 --> 1:26:21.680]  covered this we've talked about this the main one of the main train stations there the transit
[1:26:21.680 --> 1:26:26.880]  stations has been overrun with migrants and it's this testament to what migration is doing
[1:26:26.880 --> 1:26:32.480]  to the globalist stronghold which is Brussels now things got so bad as you and I discussed
[1:26:32.480 --> 1:26:38.120]  a couple weeks ago that the bus drivers stopped stopping at this station and it came out that
[1:26:38.120 --> 1:26:44.600]  some of the cleaning staff were getting they were getting vaccines for hepatitis and things
[1:26:44.600 --> 1:26:49.080]  were so bad there things looked so bad just days before the election that they made a
[1:26:49.080 --> 1:26:54.680]  big deal about clearing all of the migrants out of this park so they're trying to clean
[1:26:54.680 --> 1:26:59.040]  up their image right before the vote so that when Brussels people are riding on the trains
[1:26:59.040 --> 1:27:02.920]  and they pass this station they don't see this testament to globalism with just migrants
[1:27:02.920 --> 1:27:07.200]  laying all over the place now what has come out since then is that it's just that temporary
[1:27:07.200 --> 1:27:11.720]  fix a lot of the migrants have just moved over to this park Maximilian Park nearby where
[1:27:11.720 --> 1:27:16.000]  hundreds of them loitered during the day and right now they're sleeping there they're not
[1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:20.240]  welcome in the station but police are saying just wait until a few days after the election
[1:27:20.240 --> 1:27:24.240]  they'll all be allowed back in so these are things that people are seeing in their in
[1:27:24.240 --> 1:27:30.360]  their everyday lives now hold on a second this is actually amazing who is making this
[1:27:30.360 --> 1:27:36.120]  order because you're not saying that the police are essentially engaged in a political cover
[1:27:36.120 --> 1:27:43.160]  up well they there are police officers who have spoken and a chief inspector in Brussels
[1:27:43.160 --> 1:27:46.440]  who have spoke well yeah I'm not blaming the individual policemen I'm saying that they're
[1:27:46.440 --> 1:27:51.680]  getting orders to engage in a political cover up yes absolutely and this is just a little
[1:27:51.680 --> 1:27:56.920]  band-aid right before the election just to keep people you know tied it over and say
[1:27:56.920 --> 1:28:01.800]  oh we're making it you know we're making things better and we'll solve this all and that doesn't
[1:28:01.800 --> 1:28:05.320]  look like what's happening and I think people if they see that and they know what's what's
[1:28:05.320 --> 1:28:08.960]  going on just in Brussels for instance they're gonna say you know these people are not serious
[1:28:08.960 --> 1:28:15.240]  about solving the issues we have in Germany Merkel has said migration must continue we
[1:28:15.240 --> 1:28:19.120]  must continue to accept more Sweden is saying the same thing we must continue to accept
[1:28:19.120 --> 1:28:23.920]  more the backlash is coming this weekend maybe it's not the final straw for some of these
[1:28:23.920 --> 1:28:29.200]  countries but it's definitely the tide is turning well there's no doubt about that and
[1:28:29.200 --> 1:28:36.120]  again this is why they're trying to stop brexit with everything they got because I'm telling
[1:28:36.120 --> 1:28:39.920]  you folks if brexit happens every other country is going to be looking at it and saying wow
[1:28:39.920 --> 1:28:43.520]  well we don't want to be involved in this either this doesn't help our country alright
[1:28:43.520 --> 1:28:47.040]  Dan Lyman if you can't stick around for another segment I'd like to get into the social media

[1:33:18.960 --> 1:33:20.680]  You want to stop tyranny?
[1:33:20.680 --> 1:33:22.400]  Well so does he.
[1:33:22.400 --> 1:33:27.120]  It's Alex Jones and now your host, Owen Troyer.
[1:33:27.120 --> 1:33:34.480]  I forgot to ask Dan Lyman, hey Dan, have you taken your honk pill today?
[1:33:34.480 --> 1:33:39.760]  Oh I overload on those every day, it's the only way to cope with the madness.
[1:33:39.760 --> 1:33:41.640]  I'm overdosed right now.
[1:33:41.640 --> 1:33:47.480]  The Clown World Order Man, it's here for us, it's trying to take us over, DanLymanEuropeWars.com.
[1:33:47.480 --> 1:33:52.520]  So yes, the honk pill folks, that's how you survive in the clown world without going insane.
[1:33:52.520 --> 1:33:58.840]  I'm very thankful for the clown honk pills because when I first started figuring out
[1:33:58.840 --> 1:34:04.280]  everything that was going on years ago, it would just make me so mad and to try to channel
[1:34:04.280 --> 1:34:08.560]  that and not become an angry person is hard and the honk pill definitely helps you to
[1:34:08.560 --> 1:34:12.880]  just turn your anger and nihilism into, you know, just have a bit of fun with it because
[1:34:12.880 --> 1:34:15.160]  there's only so much you can do about it at the moment.
[1:34:15.160 --> 1:34:19.600]  Yes, and unfortunately the honk pill is not something that we can sell at the Infowars
[1:34:19.600 --> 1:34:26.080]  Store, you have to find it within yourself and out there in the ether, if you will.
[1:34:26.080 --> 1:34:28.760]  But we do have great supplements at InfowarsStore.com.
[1:34:28.760 --> 1:34:34.960]  Now we just came out with a brand new eight pack power stack, it's 50% off.
[1:34:34.960 --> 1:34:37.160]  So here's the story with this.
[1:34:37.160 --> 1:34:42.320]  If you are somebody that's curious about supplements or you've never supplemented or you're thinking
[1:34:42.320 --> 1:34:46.960]  about starting but you really don't know what to do because you're new to it, this is the
[1:34:46.960 --> 1:34:51.840]  perfect, this is the perfect combo for you, the eight pack power stack.
[1:34:51.840 --> 1:34:58.960]  So basically what you have here is you have the morning time supplement case and then
[1:34:58.960 --> 1:34:59.960]  the evening time.
[1:34:59.960 --> 1:35:00.960]  I got them both right here.
[1:35:00.960 --> 1:35:06.720]  So you've got your AM, you take these in the morning and then you got your PM and you
[1:35:06.720 --> 1:35:07.720]  take these at night.
[1:35:07.720 --> 1:35:11.720]  So again, if you're new to supplementing and you just haven't done all the research but
[1:35:11.720 --> 1:35:15.840]  you're interested and you're curious, you want to see how it, you know, affects you,
[1:35:15.840 --> 1:35:20.720]  the eight pack power stack is the best way to start because we put the great supplements

[1:36:15.440 --> 1:36:20.280]  All right, Dan Lyman, I want to talk censorship with you here.
[1:36:20.280 --> 1:36:24.640]  Oh, and by the way, coming up next, I can't even believe this, folks, this is actually
[1:36:24.640 --> 1:36:30.680]  next level because I was actually wrong, I will admit it, I am big enough to admit
[1:36:30.680 --> 1:36:36.480]  when I was wrong, it wasn't Nancy Pelosi that was going to pass out on a camera live.
[1:36:36.480 --> 1:36:40.600]  It actually was Jerry Nadler and he literally just did it.
[1:36:40.600 --> 1:36:49.680]  We've got the footage, Democrat douchebag Jerry Nadler literally just passed out on camera.
[1:36:49.680 --> 1:36:56.280]  And so I thought Nancy would be first, but Nancy's next.
[1:36:56.280 --> 1:37:03.720]  So I don't want to, I mean, he could be seriously ill, so I'm not trying to make fun of him
[1:37:03.720 --> 1:37:06.360]  or anything, but this is the state of the Democrat party, folks.
[1:37:06.360 --> 1:37:12.200]  The Jerry Nadler's and Nancy Pelosi's, they're gone, they're not even there, they don't belong
[1:37:12.200 --> 1:37:18.080]  in office, they're the ones that are unfit, they're the ones that are unhealthy, okay?
[1:37:18.080 --> 1:37:20.080]  So we've got that coming up, it's unbelievable.
[1:37:20.080 --> 1:37:24.840]  But Dan, President Trump tweets this out, when is Twitter going to allow the very popular
[1:37:24.840 --> 1:37:30.880]  conservative voices that it has so viciously shut down back into the open, it is time?
[1:37:30.880 --> 1:37:35.760]  You also have Senator Josh Hawley saying he wants to shut down Facebook and Instagram,
[1:37:35.760 --> 1:37:39.280]  which I actually agree with, I'd say just shut him down, just screw him.
[1:37:39.280 --> 1:37:40.800]  But Dan, what do you think about this?
[1:37:40.800 --> 1:37:44.600]  We just saw the Krasnstein's get banned from Twitter.
[1:37:44.600 --> 1:37:48.640]  I think that there's a head fake there, I don't really buy that as an organic thing.
[1:37:48.640 --> 1:37:51.600]  So where do you think the censorship is at right now?
[1:37:51.600 --> 1:37:56.160]  What do you take of the Krasnstein ban and the president's tweet?
[1:37:56.160 --> 1:37:58.760]  The Krasnstein ban is so strange.
[1:37:58.760 --> 1:38:05.280]  Something about it, I agree with you, something strange like is going on behind the scenes
[1:38:05.280 --> 1:38:09.640]  because they've been allowed to operate the way that they have for so long.
[1:38:09.640 --> 1:38:14.880]  And they are such icons in the resistance movement, and they just pulled that stunt
[1:38:14.880 --> 1:38:18.080]  a few days ago where they pulled their accounts for five hours.
[1:38:18.080 --> 1:38:25.760]  So I'd love to know what's going on there, I'm hesitant to jump on any conclusions.
[1:38:25.760 --> 1:38:31.480]  There was some people on our side of the ball that use that opportunity to take a stand
[1:38:31.480 --> 1:38:35.240]  for free speech and say that they do have a right to be on the platform and shouldn't
[1:38:35.240 --> 1:38:41.480]  be kicked off by all means if it's a matter of the free speech and them being suppressed
[1:38:41.480 --> 1:38:43.640]  in that way, then I'm all for that too.
[1:38:43.640 --> 1:38:47.960]  However, I feel that there's more going on behind the scenes and either they became a
[1:38:47.960 --> 1:38:53.400]  liability or there's something else in store or like you said is a head fake in play.
[1:38:53.400 --> 1:38:58.400]  I think it's a head fake and I think what they've done is they've taken the two Krasnstein's
[1:38:58.400 --> 1:39:02.280]  obviously like you said very popular for the anti-Trumpers on Twitter.
[1:39:02.280 --> 1:39:06.720]  I think they replied a dozen times to every Trump tweet, Trump farts and they sniff the
[1:39:06.720 --> 1:39:09.320]  air to think if they can tweet something.
[1:39:09.320 --> 1:39:15.640]  So I think that this was a planned ban and they went with the bot angle because I mean
[1:39:15.640 --> 1:39:19.560]  anybody, I mean I've had people come up to me and say, hey man, I can bot, you want to
[1:39:19.560 --> 1:39:20.560]  pay me?
[1:39:20.560 --> 1:39:21.560]  I'll get you a million followers on Twitter.
[1:39:21.560 --> 1:39:23.480]  So these programs are already out there.
[1:39:23.480 --> 1:39:25.080]  It's very mainstream actually.
[1:39:25.080 --> 1:39:28.360]  In fact, there's the Twitter audit where you can go audit people's followers and you can
[1:39:28.360 --> 1:39:34.040]  find out pretty easily if their follow count is actually fake bots or real accounts.
[1:39:34.040 --> 1:39:36.400]  And so this is something that's been going on for a while.
[1:39:36.400 --> 1:39:38.280]  Twitter obviously knows about it.
[1:39:38.280 --> 1:39:42.960]  The Krasnstein's, if they were doing it, I mean who knows if you believe it or not, probably
[1:39:42.960 --> 1:39:44.820]  have been doing it for a long time.
[1:39:44.820 --> 1:39:46.000]  Twitter would have known that.
[1:39:46.000 --> 1:39:50.440]  So I think that they hit the Krasnstein's to say, see, we're centering both sides and
[1:39:50.440 --> 1:39:55.400]  then they use the bot angle so that they can then use that narrative to say, oh, it's the
[1:39:55.400 --> 1:39:58.160]  bots that are showing Trump is so popular.
[1:39:58.160 --> 1:39:59.160]  It's not organic.
[1:39:59.160 --> 1:40:04.640]  So to me, it's Twitter's signaling, we're getting ready for another wave of censorship
[1:40:04.640 --> 1:40:09.440]  against conservatives, and we're going to use bots as the excuse.
[1:40:09.440 --> 1:40:12.280]  And I think the president is privy to it.
[1:40:12.280 --> 1:40:15.760]  And I think that's why he put this tweet out, Dan.
[1:40:15.760 --> 1:40:16.920]  That's certainly possible.
[1:40:16.920 --> 1:40:21.120]  And people have been clamoring for a while now, when is Trump going to do something?
[1:40:21.120 --> 1:40:23.720]  Donald Trump Jr. is really on top of this situation.
[1:40:23.720 --> 1:40:25.680]  He talks about it all the time.
[1:40:25.680 --> 1:40:32.320]  And so they know what's going on, and my hope is that there's something in the works that
[1:40:32.320 --> 1:40:39.800]  they're taking their time with before they comprehensively go after the issue.
[1:40:39.800 --> 1:40:42.880]  Because if they're not, then this is definitely a huge problem.
[1:40:42.880 --> 1:40:47.120]  It's a problem across the world with all these elections, the way that parties are being
[1:40:47.120 --> 1:40:51.240]  censored, the way that important figures are being censored, members of the media, the
[1:40:51.240 --> 1:40:56.200]  conservative media, Raheem Kassam was just taken down Facebook again for an 11-year-old
[1:40:56.200 --> 1:40:57.200]  post.
[1:40:57.200 --> 1:41:02.640]  So I mean, it's getting to the point of like, it is a crisis now at this point.
[1:41:02.640 --> 1:41:07.400]  And if supporters of populism and nationalism and the Trump movement continue to be removed
[1:41:07.400 --> 1:41:13.240]  from the platform leading up to the 2020 election, it really leaves Trump kind of exposed.
[1:41:13.240 --> 1:41:18.520]  And also, that's going to create a lot of resentment from the people who are being taken
[1:41:18.520 --> 1:41:20.280]  down and their supporters.
[1:41:20.280 --> 1:41:23.640]  As well, I'm going to say, you know, what was the point of electing Trump if we can't
[1:41:23.640 --> 1:41:28.680]  even have our own little space in the public square protected?
[1:41:28.680 --> 1:41:32.680]  So he definitely needs to make a move and needs to make a move soon in order to protect
[1:41:32.680 --> 1:41:33.680]  free speech.
[1:41:33.680 --> 1:41:37.800]  And I do love this, Josh Howley, I've watched some of his speeches, a guy's fantastic.
[1:41:37.800 --> 1:41:41.440]  So I mean, if that's the future of this movement, then we're moving in a good direction.
[1:41:41.440 --> 1:41:46.640]  We just need more of him, and we need some more time to build up our momentum as well
[1:41:46.640 --> 1:41:51.080]  and to be able to speak when we feel like we should be able to speak on social media
[1:41:51.080 --> 1:41:54.560]  or in public without being milkshakes being thrown on us, et cetera.
[1:41:54.560 --> 1:42:00.640]  Yeah, Josh Howley from Missouri has turned out to be quite an all star of a senator.
[1:42:00.640 --> 1:42:06.360]  So yeah, I mean, we'll have to find out, you know, Snapchat employees abuse data access
[1:42:06.360 --> 1:42:11.120]  to spy on users, Facebook fake account removal doubles in six months to three billion.
[1:42:11.120 --> 1:42:15.480]  I mean, so these companies are, they're having their problems.
[1:42:15.480 --> 1:42:19.360]  But you know, think about it, Dan, if you know, because who pays for these?
[1:42:19.360 --> 1:42:20.360]  Nobody pays for these.
[1:42:20.360 --> 1:42:21.820]  They got to get money from you somehow.
[1:42:21.820 --> 1:42:23.320]  So they're selling your data.
[1:42:23.320 --> 1:42:27.800]  I mean, and that's that's the big hit that I think you can go after these people on
[1:42:27.800 --> 1:42:33.800]  is, you know, but but here's the king to it's like, this is all about stopping Trump from
[1:42:33.800 --> 1:42:34.800]  getting reelected.
[1:42:34.800 --> 1:42:39.080]  This is like, if all the rideshare application said, okay, we're going to give free rides
[1:42:39.080 --> 1:42:44.200]  to people who want to go to the polls unless they're voting Trump, I mean, that's basically
[1:42:44.200 --> 1:42:48.440]  what social media is saying, like, we're going to allow you to engage in speech, but only
[1:42:48.440 --> 1:42:52.640]  if you're anti Trump, Dan Lyman from Europe Wars.com always great work.

[1:43:56.120 --> 1:43:58.120]  Thanks to you.
[1:43:58.120 --> 1:44:05.440]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the western worlds history.
[1:44:05.440 --> 1:44:19.080]  This is a digital AI enforced gag order, not to say the name Alex Jones or info wars.com.
[1:44:19.080 --> 1:44:20.800]  This is Nazi Germany level.
[1:44:20.800 --> 1:44:22.000]  This is racketeering.
[1:44:22.000 --> 1:44:23.000]  This is cartels.
[1:44:23.000 --> 1:44:25.520]  Mr. President, we need your help.
[1:44:25.520 --> 1:44:27.400]  We need it now.
[1:44:27.400 --> 1:44:29.080]  You can take on big tech.
[1:44:29.080 --> 1:44:36.440]  They saw info wars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family,
[1:44:36.440 --> 1:44:38.040]  populist organization.
[1:44:38.040 --> 1:44:43.080]  So they thought first they come for Alex Jones, then when people say, okay, take him off the
[1:44:43.080 --> 1:44:45.800]  air, everyone else like dominoes would fall.

[1:47:55.320 --> 1:48:02.920]  All you got to do is look around folks, pick your head up, look around, it's not too hard
[1:48:02.920 --> 1:48:06.000]  to see what's going on right now.
[1:48:06.000 --> 1:48:12.480]  You got a bunch of demon possessed people that don't even realize it, gnashing out against
[1:48:12.480 --> 1:48:19.080]  humanity and then you have the leaders of the democrat party that get their energy from
[1:48:19.080 --> 1:48:21.080]  the devil.
[1:48:21.080 --> 1:48:26.040]  They're now losing that energy as the devil is waning now.
[1:48:26.040 --> 1:48:31.760]  And so the story at infowarstore.com from Kelly McGreen disoriented democrat Jerry Nadler
[1:48:31.760 --> 1:48:38.120]  nearly passes out during presser, I mean he really does pass out and he kind of nodding
[1:48:38.120 --> 1:48:41.000]  his head, he's clearly ill.
[1:48:41.000 --> 1:48:46.000]  And look, I'm not here celebrating the fact that Jerry Nadler almost died on camera today,
[1:48:46.000 --> 1:48:51.640]  but this is a corrupt democrat, this is a dirt bag, this is a scumbag.
[1:48:51.640 --> 1:49:03.160]  And so I wish him the best in God's plan.
[1:49:03.160 --> 1:49:09.840]  But we thought it was Nancy Pelosi that would be the one that passed out drunk on a podium,
[1:49:09.840 --> 1:49:13.560]  it ended up being the rapscallion Jerry Nadler.
[1:49:13.560 --> 1:49:20.440]  Here is the video that just broke, Jerry Nadler passes out, he's clearly ill, I don't know
[1:49:20.440 --> 1:49:24.040]  what's going on in the middle of a democrat press conference.
[1:49:24.040 --> 1:49:27.920]  I said one time, who's in charge here?
[1:49:27.920 --> 1:49:33.720]  And I think the congressman's right about that fact, there you want some, yeah I got
[1:49:33.720 --> 1:49:40.200]  some, some here Jerry, take a drink, a little dehydrated brother.
[1:49:40.200 --> 1:49:48.600]  Prouded room full of people and he is just gone, here's bumbling Pelosi, right drunk,
[1:49:48.600 --> 1:49:50.800]  high on pills, maybe both.
[1:49:50.800 --> 1:49:59.440]  He started sending signals to the US, Mexico, Canada, if that's not the accurate, some people
[1:49:59.440 --> 1:50:06.880]  call it after NAFTA, some call it NAFTA 2.0, working together to make, pass that.
[1:50:06.880 --> 1:50:10.880]  You want to take a drink with us to keep yourself some?
[1:50:10.880 --> 1:50:13.280]  How you feel man?
[1:50:13.280 --> 1:50:19.280]  Nadler is not well, he is not well, he can't even see it's bad.
[1:50:19.280 --> 1:50:23.280]  How you feel man?
[1:50:23.280 --> 1:50:24.280]  Oh boy.
[1:50:24.280 --> 1:50:25.280]  You okay?
[1:50:25.280 --> 1:50:33.280]  Not, we're, we're the fat, the three things, the three things, the three things.
[1:50:33.280 --> 1:50:34.280]  What's up two fingers?
[1:50:34.280 --> 1:50:36.360]  We're very busy people.
[1:50:36.360 --> 1:50:40.880]  I said one time, who's in charge here?
[1:50:40.880 --> 1:50:46.880]  You are man, look again, you know, I don't get pleasure out of the fact that Jerry Nadler
[1:50:46.880 --> 1:50:50.640]  looks like he just had like a stroke or something, that's, that's serious.
[1:50:50.640 --> 1:50:59.320]  I feel bad for him as a person and for his family, but you know, sometimes the world
[1:50:59.320 --> 1:51:06.480]  has a funny way, universal karma has a funny way of coming back to you, so you have all
[1:51:06.480 --> 1:51:11.440]  these Democrats saying Trump is unfit, Trump is unhealthy, Trump can't sit up straight,
[1:51:11.440 --> 1:51:14.440]  Trump's sleepy, he's this, he's that, no, that's the Democrats.
[1:51:14.440 --> 1:51:17.720]  That's Joe Biden falling asleep before he has speeches.
[1:51:17.720 --> 1:51:21.880]  That's Jerry Nadler passing out, it looks like having a serious health problem in the
[1:51:21.880 --> 1:51:26.560]  middle of a Democrats press conference, that's Nancy Pelosi fumbling and bumbling through
[1:51:26.560 --> 1:51:29.960]  multiple press conferences every day like a drunkard.
[1:51:29.960 --> 1:51:36.080]  That's Hillary Clinton literally passing out and had to be hooked into a car because she
[1:51:36.080 --> 1:51:37.800]  was like a wet noodle.
[1:51:37.800 --> 1:51:41.400]  And then they say, oh, she just had a spout of pneumonia.
[1:51:41.400 --> 1:51:42.900]  She got cold.
[1:51:42.900 --> 1:51:46.680]  It was like 80 degrees in New York that day, she had a jacket on, she comes out the next
[1:51:46.680 --> 1:51:49.320]  day and hugs a child.
[1:51:49.320 --> 1:51:53.280]  Really she had a pneumonia and then she went out and hugged a child while she's wearing
[1:51:53.280 --> 1:51:57.160]  her seizure glasses.
[1:51:57.160 --> 1:52:04.360]  And so this is literally the party of sickly, ill, deranged people, the Democrat party,
[1:52:04.360 --> 1:52:09.600]  the Nancy Pelosi's.
[1:52:09.600 --> 1:52:12.240]  And what do they do?
[1:52:12.240 --> 1:52:21.840]  They point the finger at Trump, who's got more energy than all of them combined.
[1:52:21.840 --> 1:52:26.720]  In fact, if you look at most presidents when they get in office and then after they've
[1:52:26.720 --> 1:52:31.160]  been in office for a while, they usually age pretty quickly and not so well.
[1:52:31.160 --> 1:52:37.640]  This president, as Maxine Water says, he's like he's glowing.
[1:52:37.640 --> 1:52:42.520]  It's like he's gotten younger.
[1:52:42.520 --> 1:52:43.520]  And then what do you have?
[1:52:43.520 --> 1:52:49.480]  They say he's unfit, he's unhealthy, Jerry Nadler passes out, Hillary Clinton falls down,
[1:52:49.480 --> 1:52:55.600]  Nancy Pelosi, if she's not drunk, then there's seriously something wrong with her.
[1:52:55.600 --> 1:53:01.720]  So there you go, folks, so very interesting right there.
[1:53:01.720 --> 1:53:04.520]  All right, do we have these videos ready?
[1:53:04.520 --> 1:53:08.120]  I'm not sure how long they are.
[1:53:08.120 --> 1:53:13.560]  From Paul Joseph Watson, US Cardinal says, Islam attempting to take over the West.
[1:53:13.560 --> 1:53:15.720]  You don't have to be a rocket science to see what's happened.
[1:53:15.720 --> 1:53:20.160]  US Cardinal Raymond Burke says that resisting large-scale immigration from Muslim countries
[1:53:20.160 --> 1:53:26.360]  is the responsible exercise of one's patriotism.
[1:53:26.360 --> 1:53:33.720]  And so here is Cardinal Burke on large-scale Muslim immigration.
[1:53:33.720 --> 1:53:45.320]  Question, should a politician insist large-scale Muslim immigration be refused a papal blessing?
[1:53:45.320 --> 1:53:54.600]  Since I don't dispense papal blessings, I think the fundamental question here is someone
[1:53:54.600 --> 1:54:02.360]  who resists large-scale Muslim immigration committing an immoral act and therefore should
[1:54:02.360 --> 1:54:11.080]  be, let's say, denied holy communion or in some way recognized as a public center.
[1:54:11.080 --> 1:54:19.200]  To resist large-scale Muslim immigration, in my judgment, is to be responsible in the
[1:54:19.200 --> 1:54:25.520]  sense of making sure that those who are immigrating to the country remember that the definition
[1:54:25.520 --> 1:54:33.560]  of the church's teaching is that the individuals are not able to find a way of living in their
[1:54:33.560 --> 1:54:35.200]  own country.
[1:54:35.200 --> 1:54:43.600]  And this is not true of immigrants who come, who are opportunists, and in particular in
[1:54:43.600 --> 1:54:51.600]  the case of Islam, which by its definition is, believes itself to be destined to rule
[1:54:51.600 --> 1:54:58.160]  the world, coming in large numbers to countries that you don't have to be a rocket scientist
[1:54:58.160 --> 1:55:05.160]  to see what's happened, for instance, in Europe, in countries like France and Germany and also
[1:55:05.160 --> 1:55:07.120]  here in Italy.
[1:55:07.120 --> 1:55:09.280]  And it's also happening in the United States.
[1:55:09.280 --> 1:55:17.160]  There's a very interesting book written called No Go Zones, in which records places in the
[1:55:17.160 --> 1:55:23.920]  United States where, in fact, Muslim immigrants have set up their own legal order.
[1:55:23.920 --> 1:55:29.720]  In other words, they resist the authority, the legitimate authority of the state.
[1:55:29.720 --> 1:55:39.360]  And so to be opposed to wholesale or large-scale Muslim immigration is, in fact, as far as
[1:55:39.360 --> 1:55:50.880]  I'm concerned, a responsible exercise of one's patriotism in the sense that we, yes, people
[1:55:50.880 --> 1:55:57.040]  who are true refugees who can't live in their own country, we must receive them and help
[1:55:57.040 --> 1:55:58.360]  them in every way.
[1:55:58.360 --> 1:56:05.120]  But this is not the case when you have simply a large-scale immigration.
[1:56:05.120 --> 1:56:10.280]  So there's Cardinal Raymond Burke, actually had the opportunity to meet him when he served
[1:56:10.280 --> 1:56:14.760]  in the Archdiocese of St. Louis from 2004 to 2008.
[1:56:14.760 --> 1:56:21.080]  So it's glad to see that not everyone from the Catholic Church is pro-globalism.
[1:56:21.080 --> 1:56:25.360]  And so you won't hear that from the Pope, and you kind of heard him joking about it.
[1:56:25.360 --> 1:56:31.280]  And you're starting to actually see signs inside of the ministry now that are kind of
[1:56:31.280 --> 1:56:38.920]  going against the Pope, who's clearly open borders, one world government, globalist.
[1:56:38.920 --> 1:56:44.520]  And so we've got another video of another Cardinal coming up in the next hour, a warning
[1:56:44.520 --> 1:56:45.520]  of the same thing.
[1:56:45.520 --> 1:56:50.520]  Vatican Cardinal Warren's West will disappear because of mass migration, but it's all ready
[1:56:50.520 --> 1:56:53.240]  happening.
[1:56:53.240 --> 1:56:58.280]  It's all ready happening.
[1:56:58.280 --> 1:57:05.360]  I said this yesterday, and the only chance there is to stop it from happening is the
[1:57:05.360 --> 1:57:06.360]  Brexit.
[1:57:06.360 --> 1:57:12.600]  But if they don't complete the Brexit, it's basically like this.
[1:57:12.600 --> 1:57:15.760]  In 20 years, everything hinges on Brexit.
[1:57:15.760 --> 1:57:21.560]  In 20 years, if you don't get Brexit, Europe will be the Middle East.
[1:57:21.560 --> 1:57:24.880]  In 20 years, if you do get Brexit, Europe will still be Europe, and you'll still have
[1:57:24.880 --> 1:57:25.880]  European countries.
[1:57:25.880 --> 1:57:28.240]  You can go and they'll still be culture.
[1:57:28.240 --> 1:57:34.680]  If you don't get Brexit, the European Union will have wide open borders, Islam will move
[1:57:34.680 --> 1:57:43.960]  in, it'll take over Europe, turn it into the Middle East, and that'll be it for Europe.
[1:57:43.960 --> 1:57:47.680]  So they have a choice to make right now.
[1:57:47.680 --> 1:57:52.160]  Everybody knows that supplements are amazing, that what God gave us from other nature is
[1:57:52.160 --> 1:57:53.160]  incredible.
[1:57:53.160 --> 1:57:56.320]  That's why supplements are the biggest growing industry in the world, and the globalists
[1:57:56.320 --> 1:57:57.760]  are so upset.
[1:57:57.760 --> 1:58:03.440]  The problem is people forget to take them, and that's why the whole industry has moved
[1:58:03.440 --> 1:58:06.960]  towards packets that you take in the morning and you take at night.
[1:58:06.960 --> 1:58:11.840]  So we looked at that, we made the very best AM and PM packets out there with an incredible

[1:59:44.720 --> 1:59:46.720]  This is InfoWarsLife.com.
[2:00:15.720 --> 2:00:20.560]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we have the video.
[2:00:20.560 --> 2:00:26.160]  This is horrifying, shocking stuff that we're about to air for you here, but two of the
[2:00:26.160 --> 2:00:33.840]  top Democrats that criticized Trump for his mental health and his fitness, Nancy Pelosi
[2:00:33.840 --> 2:00:40.120]  and Jerry Nadler, you've got Pelosi either drunkenly babbling or she's seriously mentally
[2:00:40.120 --> 2:00:42.160]  ill during a press conference.
[2:00:42.160 --> 2:00:46.800]  And then Nadler today, I mean, we try not to joke, I mean, it looks like he may have
[2:00:46.800 --> 2:00:50.200]  had a stroke or something today during a press conference.
[2:00:50.200 --> 2:00:57.240]  So just look at the Democrats who claim Trump is mentally unfit, who can't even get through
[2:00:57.240 --> 2:00:59.440]  a press conference.
[2:00:59.440 --> 2:01:02.440]  I said one time, who's in charge here?
[2:01:02.440 --> 2:01:05.840]  And I think the congressman's right about that fact.
[2:01:05.840 --> 2:01:07.840]  Jerry, you want some?
[2:01:07.840 --> 2:01:08.840]  Yeah, I got some.
[2:01:08.840 --> 2:01:16.920]  I'm here, Jerry, take a drink, look a little dehydrated, brother, do you see a little dehydrated?
[2:01:16.920 --> 2:01:17.920]  Okay?
[2:01:17.920 --> 2:01:23.520]  Well, I took a little longer on the floor than I had anticipated in the custody of the
[2:01:23.520 --> 2:01:33.360]  border, everyone, they started making, sending signals to the U.S., Mexico, Canada, if that's
[2:01:33.360 --> 2:01:38.320]  not the accurate, some people call it AFTA NAFTA, some call it NAFTA 2.0.
[2:01:38.320 --> 2:01:42.720]  2.0, working together to make, pass that.
[2:01:42.720 --> 2:01:44.920]  You seem a little dehydrated, okay?
[2:01:44.920 --> 2:01:45.920]  Oh boy.
[2:01:45.920 --> 2:01:50.600]  So here's Pelosi and Nadler, they can't even finish their thought at a press conference
[2:01:50.600 --> 2:01:53.320]  here, they're fumbling and bumbling.
[2:01:53.320 --> 2:01:59.320]  You wish they were drunk, but this is just the lack of brain power that they have.
[2:01:59.320 --> 2:02:21.680]  Now folks, you wish that you were watching Nancy Pelosi and Jerry Nadler drunk, unable
[2:02:21.680 --> 2:02:24.520]  to think, but the truth is they just have no brain force.
[2:02:24.520 --> 2:02:35.200]  So I want to just put out a message right now to the Democrats because look, your leaders,
[2:02:35.200 --> 2:02:41.920]  Nancy Pelosi and Jerry Nadler are struggling.
[2:02:41.920 --> 2:02:49.880]  And so we've got Brain Force Plus at infowarstore.com and if there has ever been an example of somebody
[2:02:49.880 --> 2:02:55.600]  that needs Brain Force Plus, the neural activator, it's Nancy Pelosi and it's Jerry Nadler.
[2:02:55.600 --> 2:03:03.480]  Now unfortunately, we're not miracle workers here and we can only do so much with our great
[2:03:03.480 --> 2:03:09.440]  supplements at infowarstore.com, but if there's any hope at all for Nancy Pelosi or Jerry
[2:03:09.440 --> 2:03:14.560]  Nadler to get their brain working, it's Brain Force Plus from infowarstore.com.
[2:03:14.560 --> 2:03:20.440]  And if you're ever feeling like a Pelosi or a Nadler and you can't think or talk straight
[2:03:20.440 --> 2:03:25.560]  or move, Brain Force Plus is the answer.
[2:03:25.560 --> 2:03:30.000]  So don't be a Pelosi and fumble and bumble through a press conference like a gibbering
[2:03:30.000 --> 2:03:31.000]  idiot.
[2:03:31.000 --> 2:03:35.720]  Don't be a Jerry Nadler who can't even think or pick his head up and look forward during
[2:03:35.720 --> 2:03:38.240]  a press conference.
[2:03:38.240 --> 2:03:43.140]  Go to infowarstore.com and get yourself some Brain Force Plus.
[2:03:43.140 --> 2:03:45.880]  You don't want to look like Pelosi, okay?
[2:03:45.880 --> 2:03:47.520]  You don't want to look like Nadler.
[2:03:47.520 --> 2:03:48.520]  You want to look sharp.
[2:03:48.520 --> 2:03:49.880]  You want your mind to be sharp.
[2:03:49.880 --> 2:03:54.480]  So go to infowarstore.com and get your Brain Force Plus today.
[2:03:54.480 --> 2:04:00.400]  Otherwise, you might end up like Jerry Nadler or Nancy Pelosi embarrassing yourself because
[2:04:00.400 --> 2:04:04.360]  you can't think straight.
[2:04:04.360 --> 2:04:12.120]  But you know, if you watch these videos of Pelosi and Nadler, I mean you would say those
[2:04:12.120 --> 2:04:13.520]  people are drunk.
[2:04:13.520 --> 2:04:17.880]  You'd say, okay, Pelosi's drunk, Nadler's drunk.
[2:04:17.880 --> 2:04:21.000]  I mean, he looks like he's passed out drunk at a party or something.
[2:04:21.000 --> 2:04:25.200]  Now, we're not told that they have major health problems.
[2:04:25.200 --> 2:04:26.480]  Maybe they do.
[2:04:26.480 --> 2:04:30.040]  Maybe Nancy Pelosi has some serious mental health problems.
[2:04:30.040 --> 2:04:34.480]  Maybe Jerry Nadler's having some serious health problems because it looks that way.
[2:04:34.480 --> 2:04:42.320]  Either these people are dead drunk or they're having serious, serious health problems just
[2:04:42.320 --> 2:04:44.760]  like Hillary Clinton, just like Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
[2:04:44.760 --> 2:04:50.240]  So the Democrat Party is not only falling apart intellectually, literally the health
[2:04:50.240 --> 2:04:52.920]  of all of their leaders is deteriorating.
[2:04:52.920 --> 2:04:54.920]  We'll be right back.

[2:06:10.280 --> 2:06:12.240]  It's Alex Jones.
[2:06:12.240 --> 2:06:25.920]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[2:06:25.920 --> 2:06:41.680]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show at infowars.com.
[2:06:41.680 --> 2:06:49.760]  This is my guest, Stefan Arneo.com.
[2:06:49.760 --> 2:06:56.840]  His book, Hard Times, Strong Men.com is a book that highlights masculinity and how important
[2:06:56.840 --> 2:07:02.480]  it is to civilization, which of course is why they want it demonized and removed, unless
[2:07:02.480 --> 2:07:10.040]  of course you're a female that wants to be a male, then it's all good to go.
[2:07:10.040 --> 2:07:11.920]  So Stefan joins me.
[2:07:11.920 --> 2:07:17.560]  What is the purpose of your book, Hard Times, Create Strong Men?
[2:07:17.560 --> 2:07:23.400]  So Owen, about a year and a half ago, I was in the jungle fasting, just water, no food.
[2:07:23.400 --> 2:07:29.080]  And I came home to my business with about eight employees at the time, and the young
[2:07:29.080 --> 2:07:34.480]  men, 20 years old, 21, 22 years old, they said, you're mean, I don't like you, I don't
[2:07:34.480 --> 2:07:39.200]  like working here, this isn't my dream, all these kind of effeminate girl complaints coming
[2:07:39.200 --> 2:07:40.200]  from these young men.
[2:07:40.200 --> 2:07:41.200]  And I said, what's wrong with these young men?
[2:07:41.200 --> 2:07:45.120]  So I sat them down and I had a six hour, how to be a man talk over the week, and I got
[2:07:45.120 --> 2:07:46.120]  tired of doing that.
[2:07:46.120 --> 2:07:49.440]  So I started writing down how to be a man in a book, which became Hard Times, Create
[2:07:49.440 --> 2:07:50.440]  Strong Men.
[2:07:50.440 --> 2:07:53.960]  And I realized these young men don't have fathers, they don't have male influence.
[2:07:53.960 --> 2:07:58.240]  And our young men have essentially turned into badly behaved teenage girls.
[2:07:58.240 --> 2:08:03.760]  So in the book, I write about what is a man in money, sex, religion, politics in regards
[2:08:03.760 --> 2:08:06.040]  to history and how strong men used to be.
[2:08:06.040 --> 2:08:12.920]  Well, and you know, that's an interesting take because I see, I mean, you know what
[2:08:12.920 --> 2:08:17.440]  they do is they sit here and they try to make everything sexist if you point out the differences
[2:08:17.440 --> 2:08:19.480]  between men and women.
[2:08:19.480 --> 2:08:25.800]  But you know, I look at men as a man and I hear what you're saying and I'm saying, yeah,
[2:08:25.800 --> 2:08:31.240]  men that give me excuses instead of action, you know, that's not the type of men that
[2:08:31.240 --> 2:08:35.480]  build society, that's not the type of men that build anything really.
[2:08:35.480 --> 2:08:40.320]  And so, but that's the type of men that they want, and that's why they run to the state
[2:08:40.320 --> 2:08:44.880]  or that's why they run to AI or that's why heck, they run to their computer instead of
[2:08:44.880 --> 2:08:47.840]  you know, trying to meet a woman, I think you know where I'm going with this.
[2:08:47.840 --> 2:08:56.040]  So I mean, do you think that just, what do you think is behind kind of the unmasculinity
[2:08:56.040 --> 2:08:57.680]  of men?
[2:08:57.680 --> 2:08:59.600]  Well, it's very simple.
[2:08:59.600 --> 2:09:04.760]  I mean, the demasculization of men, I think started in the 1960s and it was with the rise
[2:09:04.760 --> 2:09:10.640]  of feminism and you had the Soviets in the Cold War, they sent over their agents and
[2:09:10.640 --> 2:09:16.320]  their propaganda to bring communism, atheism and feminism over and that's the opposite
[2:09:16.320 --> 2:09:21.920]  of what the United States has been for a long time and made the USA the greatest country
[2:09:21.920 --> 2:09:27.200]  in the world, which was capitalism, gender differences and a Judeo-Christian tradition.
[2:09:27.200 --> 2:09:32.560]  So they've subverted the values and what it's done is it's created this gender homogene
[2:09:32.560 --> 2:09:36.920]  where instead of standing up against strong men, I mean America was born out of war with
[2:09:36.920 --> 2:09:43.000]  strong men, you know, bucking the king of England and now these men have been weakened,
[2:09:43.000 --> 2:09:47.920]  they've been homogenized and the cycles of history go hard times create strong men, strong
[2:09:47.920 --> 2:09:52.400]  men create good times, good times create weak men and weak men create hard times and we're
[2:09:52.400 --> 2:09:57.440]  going into that part of the cycle where the men are weak, the culture's falling apart,
[2:09:57.440 --> 2:10:00.400]  the culture's built with the men and it falls with the men.
[2:10:00.400 --> 2:10:03.880]  So right now we're, oh there you got the soy boys up on the screen, I mean we're at this
[2:10:03.880 --> 2:10:08.720]  point where the good times have created weak men and coming in 2020 this is the point in
[2:10:08.720 --> 2:10:12.920]  the cycle, it's an 80 year cycle where hard times are coming and we're going to need those
[2:10:12.920 --> 2:10:15.000]  strong men more than ever before.
[2:10:15.000 --> 2:10:21.080]  Well and they've blurred the lines of what, you know, a man and a woman are meant to be
[2:10:21.080 --> 2:10:29.000]  because they just call it sexist and, you know, it's funny to me because these people,
[2:10:29.000 --> 2:10:31.760]  they don't even really follow their own logic.
[2:10:31.760 --> 2:10:34.720]  There's this thing called a two-spirit, are you familiar with the two-spirit?
[2:10:34.720 --> 2:10:40.840]  Well I've got the 63 genders, the official genders in my book and like it just goes
[2:10:40.840 --> 2:10:44.320]  on and on, like when I was reading the audiobook I had to stop three times because I was laughing
[2:10:44.320 --> 2:10:49.640]  so hard at the 63, you know, mutant genders out there and I don't want to hate on people
[2:10:49.640 --> 2:10:53.560]  but that's just pure insanity and those people would be in the mental institution if it was,
[2:10:53.560 --> 2:10:55.040]  you know, 50 years ago.
[2:10:55.040 --> 2:10:59.920]  Oh well yeah but I figured out how we can break this matrix so here's what somebody
[2:10:59.920 --> 2:11:01.520]  can do.
[2:11:01.520 --> 2:11:06.320]  One of like the biggest, I'm dead serious, if we can destroy this whole thing with one
[2:11:06.320 --> 2:11:13.600]  man, the biggest bodybuilder in the world that's a man who has all the strongman records
[2:11:13.600 --> 2:11:18.200]  needs to have all the records for the strongman and then declare he's a woman, break every
[2:11:18.200 --> 2:11:22.720]  female lifting record and then declare he's a man again and retire from being a woman,
[2:11:22.720 --> 2:11:24.000]  he's a two-spirit.
[2:11:24.000 --> 2:11:25.360]  And so what are you going to do?
[2:11:25.360 --> 2:11:28.880]  I mean this is what they promote, this is what they practice, this is what they say
[2:11:28.880 --> 2:11:29.880]  is normal behavior.
[2:11:29.880 --> 2:11:30.880]  So that's all you got to do.
[2:11:30.880 --> 2:11:35.160]  You just have to act out the behavior they claim is normal to show how insane it is.
[2:11:35.160 --> 2:11:36.160]  So I'm dead serious.
[2:11:36.160 --> 2:11:41.080]  You know, there's a guy, Zubi, who got real, he was a rapper but he got real famous after
[2:11:41.080 --> 2:11:45.880]  he faked being a woman and did a deadlift record or excuse me, I'm sexist, he is a woman.
[2:11:45.880 --> 2:11:51.640]  Somebody needs to claim to be a two-spirit, a man that holds all weight lifting records
[2:11:51.640 --> 2:11:56.240]  and then shift and be a woman, break every weight lifting, I mean literally every one,
[2:11:56.240 --> 2:12:01.960]  rewrite the whole book on women's weight lifting so it's just you and keep your male name
[2:12:01.960 --> 2:12:05.480]  and then just say no, I'm a two-spirit and then go back to lifting as a man.
[2:12:05.480 --> 2:12:06.480]  What are they going to do then?
[2:12:06.480 --> 2:12:10.760]  Are they going to admit that their whole ideology is fake?
[2:12:10.760 --> 2:12:11.760]  We should get that going.
[2:12:11.760 --> 2:12:13.720]  I mean it is a fake ideology.
[2:12:13.720 --> 2:12:19.640]  It's subjectivism versus objectism and we have men as men and we have women as women
[2:12:19.640 --> 2:12:25.480]  and that's what built this entire western free society is objectivism and men are men
[2:12:25.480 --> 2:12:28.960]  and women are women and now when you make everybody the same, the whole thing just loses meaning
[2:12:28.960 --> 2:12:31.440]  so I love what you're saying though and I think we should do it.
[2:12:31.440 --> 2:12:33.240]  Let's find a guy and get that going right now.
[2:12:33.240 --> 2:12:38.680]  Did you hear about the MMA fighter, a biological man, transition to woman that got in the ring
[2:12:38.680 --> 2:12:42.160]  with a woman and crushed her skull?
[2:12:42.160 --> 2:12:46.400]  I didn't hear about that but I heard about a lot of different men wrestling women and
[2:12:46.400 --> 2:12:48.640]  beating them and running races and all sorts of races.
[2:12:48.640 --> 2:12:53.440]  I don't think there's any US Navy SEALs as women, is there?
[2:12:53.440 --> 2:12:57.000]  There may have been one that passed the test but they were thinking about changing the
[2:12:57.000 --> 2:13:00.040]  tests so that they could perhaps get women to pass it.
[2:13:00.040 --> 2:13:04.360]  Hey, if a woman can pass the SEALs test, I believe that's the hardest one, more power
[2:13:04.360 --> 2:13:10.360]  to them but that's not even what this is about because I don't even know what this is about.
[2:13:10.360 --> 2:13:13.920]  It's literally just about destroying human roles is really what it's about.
[2:13:13.920 --> 2:13:17.760]  I mean it's insane to say you can be a man and a woman on the same day.
[2:13:17.760 --> 2:13:22.080]  I mean that's literally insane but it's like we have to practice this to show them how
[2:13:22.080 --> 2:13:23.080]  insane it is.
[2:13:23.080 --> 2:13:28.400]  Like yeah, all these men should just start playing women's rugby and just join one team
[2:13:28.400 --> 2:13:30.240]  and crush their skulls and say what?
[2:13:30.240 --> 2:13:31.240]  We're women.
[2:13:31.240 --> 2:13:32.240]  What's wrong with this?
[2:13:32.240 --> 2:13:37.400]  Well, it really is about power and control because when you can take your men, these
[2:13:37.400 --> 2:13:42.120]  dangerous young men that could rise up and start a revolution, you feminize them and
[2:13:42.120 --> 2:13:46.080]  pump them full of soy and give them porno and video games and all these distractions
[2:13:46.080 --> 2:13:51.040]  and take away God and take away religion and take away families, then you have all these
[2:13:51.040 --> 2:13:56.000]  very easy to control little boys and cubicles and the men in power get to stay in power
[2:13:56.000 --> 2:13:59.480]  and the men who would rise up and take power, they're disabled.
[2:13:59.480 --> 2:14:03.640]  So this is really just about power here and it's about keeping the new young men down
[2:14:03.640 --> 2:14:06.040]  and keeping the old guys in power.
[2:14:06.040 --> 2:14:13.480]  Yeah, there was a, well the viral video was a guy who, you've probably seen it, he's
[2:14:13.480 --> 2:14:17.720]  definitely a soy boy and he kind of sticks his tongue out and he's got a purple hood
[2:14:17.720 --> 2:14:21.720]  on and he does like a 360 kick to a woman.
[2:14:21.720 --> 2:14:28.320]  He kicks a woman because she's pro-life and recently, and he actually regrets it, but
[2:14:28.320 --> 2:14:33.280]  recently the video kind of resurfaced and went viral, someone tweeted out, I still stand
[2:14:33.280 --> 2:14:39.760]  with this king, this king and I'm looking at it and I'm like, let me tell you something,
[2:14:39.760 --> 2:14:45.200]  that individual right there, the loins of that individual will never be a king, have
[2:14:45.200 --> 2:14:51.080]  never been a king and could never even hold any position of earned power.
[2:14:51.080 --> 2:14:54.800]  And so it's just the funniest thing, they take the weakest, most pathetic men and they
[2:14:54.800 --> 2:15:01.320]  say that's a king, but in the old, like old kings used to ride into battle on the front
[2:15:01.320 --> 2:15:04.520]  line, like that's how they became king.
[2:15:04.520 --> 2:15:08.440]  That little sucker would never be a king, he'd be on the back line picking up the rest
[2:15:08.440 --> 2:15:10.400]  of their extra men.
[2:15:10.400 --> 2:15:15.040]  Well, this is, this is what the cycles of history are, I mean, we're going from good
[2:15:15.040 --> 2:15:19.640]  times create weak men since 2000 to 2020 and then we're going to go back into hard times
[2:15:19.640 --> 2:15:20.640]  create strong men.
[2:15:20.640 --> 2:15:21.640]  And you know what?
[2:15:21.640 --> 2:15:24.680]  Oh, and I think there's hope because we will have a pretty hard event coming up in I think
[2:15:24.680 --> 2:15:29.880]  in 2020, between 2020 and 2026, I think there's going to be a pretty hard time happening and
[2:15:29.880 --> 2:15:33.280]  I think it's going to snap a lot of these guys out of this and I think we're going to throw
[2:15:33.280 --> 2:15:38.200]  a lot of this nonsense away at some point because it just can't last on its own in nature.
[2:15:38.200 --> 2:15:40.480]  So hard times do create strong men.
[2:15:40.480 --> 2:15:47.280]  All right, if you're a, if you are a competitive weightlifter and you hold world records as
[2:15:47.280 --> 2:15:52.240]  a male weightlifter, please just, just go to spirit, break every women's weightlifting
[2:15:52.240 --> 2:15:55.800]  record just to show how insane it is.

[2:16:23.560 --> 2:16:26.320]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[2:16:26.320 --> 2:16:30.240]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[2:16:30.240 --> 2:16:31.800]  I sued the IRS in one.

[2:16:54.720 --> 2:17:00.080]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[2:17:00.080 --> 2:17:01.080]  the world.
[2:17:01.080 --> 2:17:04.120]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[2:17:04.120 --> 2:17:10.080]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[2:17:10.080 --> 2:17:13.880]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[2:17:13.880 --> 2:17:14.880]  Was there ever a vote?
[2:17:14.880 --> 2:17:16.440]  Who do we fight for?
[2:17:16.440 --> 2:17:23.000]  The Deep State began with World War I, the United States of Empire by James Dunn, available

[2:18:01.920 --> 2:18:03.600]  I'm so glad to be talking to you.
[2:18:03.600 --> 2:18:04.600]  I'm so excited.
[2:18:04.600 --> 2:18:05.600]  I'm such a big fan.
[2:18:05.600 --> 2:18:07.840]  Ever since I've been listening, I've been buying your products.
[2:18:07.840 --> 2:18:10.440]  I got to do a shout out for the bone broth.
[2:18:10.440 --> 2:18:11.440]  The bone broth.
[2:18:11.440 --> 2:18:12.440]  The bone broth.
[2:18:12.440 --> 2:18:13.440]  The bone broth.
[2:18:13.440 --> 2:18:14.440]  The bone broth.
[2:18:14.440 --> 2:18:15.440]  The bone broth.
[2:18:15.440 --> 2:18:16.440]  The bone broth.
[2:18:16.440 --> 2:18:20.440]  It tastes like, tastes like great milkshake, you know, if you just add it to milk.
[2:18:20.440 --> 2:18:21.440]  It tastes like oval theme.
[2:18:21.440 --> 2:18:22.440]  It tastes like oval theme.
[2:18:22.440 --> 2:18:23.440]  It tastes like oval theme.
[2:18:23.440 --> 2:18:24.440]  It tastes like oval theme.
[2:18:24.440 --> 2:18:25.440]  Like good.
[2:18:25.440 --> 2:18:26.440]  Whoa.
[2:18:26.440 --> 2:18:28.480]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[2:18:28.480 --> 2:18:32.880]  My daughter uses the bubblegum fluoride-free toothpaste.
[2:18:32.880 --> 2:18:37.520]  I've used the SuperMail Vitality, a host of other products, so thank you so much for
[2:18:37.520 --> 2:18:38.520]  that as well.
[2:18:38.520 --> 2:18:41.040]  Brother, you're thanking me for buying the products and keeping us on air.
[2:18:41.040 --> 2:18:42.040]  I'm thanking you.
[2:18:42.040 --> 2:18:46.720]  But yes, this is the ultimate bone broth formula with the turmeric, the chocolate mushroom,
[2:18:46.720 --> 2:18:47.720]  the true bone broth.
[2:18:47.720 --> 2:18:48.720]  It is next level.
[2:18:48.720 --> 2:18:49.720]  It really is good.
[2:18:49.720 --> 2:18:50.720]  So thank you.
[2:18:50.720 --> 2:18:52.280]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[2:18:52.280 --> 2:18:53.280]  Thank you.
[2:18:53.280 --> 2:19:02.440]  Stacey, in the great state of Texas, in FEMA Reason 6, you're on the air worldwide, Stacey.
[2:19:02.440 --> 2:19:03.440]  Good to talk to you.
[2:19:03.440 --> 2:19:07.360]  Before I get into what I want to say, I just want to let you know that I don't normally
[2:19:07.360 --> 2:19:08.520]  take vitamins at all.
[2:19:08.520 --> 2:19:10.480]  I was turned on to the ultimate female force.
[2:19:10.480 --> 2:19:14.480]  I looked at all the ingredients and they're all organic, root, things like that, that
[2:19:14.480 --> 2:19:15.480]  I trust.
[2:19:15.480 --> 2:19:17.480]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins.
[2:19:17.480 --> 2:19:20.600]  They don't have things that they say that they have in them, and they're often not things
[2:19:20.600 --> 2:19:21.600]  that are natural.
[2:19:21.600 --> 2:19:22.600]  I appreciate that.
[2:19:22.600 --> 2:19:23.600]  What about the ultimate female force?
[2:19:23.600 --> 2:19:24.600]  Tell us about it.
[2:19:24.600 --> 2:19:25.600]  Well, it's really great.
[2:19:25.600 --> 2:19:26.600]  You know, it's like a multivitamin.
[2:19:26.600 --> 2:19:27.600]  I take it.
[2:19:27.600 --> 2:19:28.600]  It tastes good.
[2:19:28.600 --> 2:19:29.600]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[2:19:29.600 --> 2:19:31.600]  It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste.
[2:19:31.600 --> 2:19:34.080]  And you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day.
[2:19:34.080 --> 2:19:35.080]  So I really like it.
[2:19:35.080 --> 2:19:38.560]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are, they're known to turbo
[2:19:38.560 --> 2:19:41.720]  charge women, and then we get the organic ones and put it in it.
[2:19:41.720 --> 2:19:47.520]  So yeah, stamina, libido, energy, these are amazing things in ultimate female force.
[2:19:47.520 --> 2:19:59.320]  I'm glad you plugged it info or store.com or triple A 2533139.
[2:19:59.320 --> 2:20:12.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:20:12.800 --> 2:20:21.800]  Let's go.
[2:20:21.800 --> 2:20:25.800]  Stefan Arneo is my guest, his book, Hard Times, Strong Men.
[2:20:25.800 --> 2:20:27.720]  I love his foundational precept.
[2:20:27.720 --> 2:20:32.000]  Strong men create good times, good times create weak men, weak men create hard times, hard
[2:20:32.000 --> 2:20:38.000]  times create strong men, and the cycle begins.
[2:20:38.000 --> 2:20:45.200]  And so we're discussing how masculinity has been under attack and in many cases destroyed
[2:20:45.200 --> 2:20:46.520]  in the West.
[2:20:46.520 --> 2:20:53.560]  You know, we recognize that here at Infowars and we know why this is going on.
[2:20:53.560 --> 2:21:00.120]  It's the media, it's the chemicals in the food and water, it's the pornography, it's
[2:21:00.120 --> 2:21:01.120]  all of it.
[2:21:01.120 --> 2:21:02.640]  It really is all of it.
[2:21:02.640 --> 2:21:08.200]  And you know, in fact, you know, I'll just say this because it's not said enough and
[2:21:08.200 --> 2:21:13.200]  I understand why and I'm not attacking the porn industry because actually there's actually
[2:21:13.200 --> 2:21:19.960]  a lot of good people that are woke and listen to Infowars, believe it or not, good people.
[2:21:19.960 --> 2:21:22.320]  And you know, they're just making a living.
[2:21:22.320 --> 2:21:29.480]  But honestly, if there's young men listening to this, you need to just avoid pornography
[2:21:29.480 --> 2:21:36.080]  at all costs, just avoid it, do not masturbate, it's bad.
[2:21:36.080 --> 2:21:41.960]  It is bad for you, it destroys your masculinity, it destroys your testosterone levels, and
[2:21:41.960 --> 2:21:48.800]  it kills your instinct to procreate and to find a woman, okay?
[2:21:48.800 --> 2:21:54.840]  And the science is out there, the numbers are out there, it's bad, okay?
[2:21:54.840 --> 2:21:58.480]  Now I'm not, again, I'm not saying you're saying you're bad if you do that, I'm just
[2:21:58.480 --> 2:22:06.760]  telling young men out there, you're handicapping your masculinity big time when you engage
[2:22:06.760 --> 2:22:09.600]  in pornography and watching pornography.
[2:22:09.600 --> 2:22:14.400]  It kills your masculinity, it kills your testosterone, it kills your drive.
[2:22:14.400 --> 2:22:22.280]  And that's just one aspect of society that is hurting men's drive, but you have the chemical
[2:22:22.280 --> 2:22:23.280]  aspect as well.
[2:22:23.280 --> 2:22:27.600]  And so we realize that and that's why at InfowarsStore.com we have Alpha Power, Vital
[2:22:27.600 --> 2:22:32.840]  Mail, Androgen, Biosynthesis Promoter, an amazing product, honestly, this thing works
[2:22:32.840 --> 2:22:35.440]  so good folks, I can't use it, okay?
[2:22:35.440 --> 2:22:39.400]  I'll just leave it at that, this is too powerful for me.
[2:22:39.400 --> 2:22:44.680]  But other people have found this to be an incredible product and it is, but I do take
[2:22:44.680 --> 2:22:49.120]  the Supermail Vitality from InfowarsStore.com twice a day, once in the morning and then
[2:22:49.120 --> 2:22:51.960]  once in the evening before my workout.
[2:22:51.960 --> 2:22:58.680]  So I highly recommend both of these products, again, the Alpha Power for me, it's too powerful,
[2:22:58.680 --> 2:23:03.840]  I don't necessarily need that much mail vitality, I'll just put it to you that way.
[2:23:03.840 --> 2:23:09.600]  But the Supermail Vitality, amazing, InfowarsStore.com, it's 50% off, I take it twice a day, it's
[2:23:09.600 --> 2:23:14.120]  just great, it gives you that extra energy and that vitality that you've been missing.
[2:23:14.120 --> 2:23:18.920]  So, Stefan Arneo, my guest, he wrote the book, Hard Times, Strong Men.
[2:23:18.920 --> 2:23:23.600]  You know, you said something the last second, I'd like you to kind of keep going down that
[2:23:23.600 --> 2:23:27.680]  road, you said you're expecting some hard times coming for 2020 to 2016 to create some
[2:23:27.680 --> 2:23:33.280]  strong men, what do you envision or see coming?
[2:23:33.280 --> 2:23:40.800]  So there's two historical cycles that are converging between 2020 and 2026, one is the
[2:23:40.800 --> 2:23:49.360]  80-year cycle of war and the last time we had hard times create strong men, that was
[2:23:49.360 --> 2:23:51.000]  in 1940 and World War II.
[2:23:51.000 --> 2:23:57.640]  And so 20 years, 20 years, 20 years, 20 years, four sets of 20, that's four generations later,
[2:23:57.640 --> 2:23:59.140]  is 2020.
[2:23:59.140 --> 2:24:03.880]  And so every 80 years we have a big war and if you don't believe that, you can look at
[2:24:03.880 --> 2:24:08.840]  80 years before World War II was the American Civil War, about 1860.
[2:24:08.840 --> 2:24:16.520]  So we've got about an 80-year cycle there, so 80 years added on to 1940 is 2020 and that
[2:24:16.520 --> 2:24:18.560]  could be the next global conflict.
[2:24:18.560 --> 2:24:24.080]  So that cycle is coming to an end right now pretty much in the next year.
[2:24:24.080 --> 2:24:30.480]  And then the other cycle that's converging about the same time is the 250-year lifespan
[2:24:30.480 --> 2:24:38.600]  of democracy and America started in 1776 and 250 years added on to that is 2026.
[2:24:38.600 --> 2:24:42.840]  So that's usually where we turn into a tyranny.
[2:24:42.840 --> 2:24:48.280]  In Rome it went from a republic to an empire, Julius Caesar took over.
[2:24:48.280 --> 2:24:53.940]  So we might end up with an emperor and not even know it.
[2:24:53.940 --> 2:24:59.920]  So there's two major things happening there and I hope they don't happen, but that's history
[2:24:59.920 --> 2:25:02.200]  that repeats itself over and over again.
[2:25:02.200 --> 2:25:07.920]  Well, this is actually crazy to kind of go off the deep end into the occult, if you will.
[2:25:07.920 --> 2:25:13.440]  There's the old internet, I guess you could call it a meme or theory, that Donald Trump
[2:25:13.440 --> 2:25:14.600]  is a time traveler.
[2:25:14.600 --> 2:25:15.600]  Have you seen this?
[2:25:15.600 --> 2:25:16.600]  With the old...
[2:25:16.600 --> 2:25:19.320]  Oh yeah, from the Simpsons and stuff.
[2:25:19.320 --> 2:25:24.120]  The Ingersoll Lockwood novels, have you seen these Ingersoll Lockwood novels?
[2:25:24.120 --> 2:25:25.440]  I think I heard about them.
[2:25:25.440 --> 2:25:26.440]  So there's one of them.
[2:25:26.440 --> 2:25:30.680]  Anyway, Ingersoll Lockwood was writing in the late 1800s and I believe his last book
[2:25:30.680 --> 2:25:34.680]  was like maybe 1898, something like that.
[2:25:34.680 --> 2:25:40.520]  It was the last president and it talks about the last president in the U.S. and it's talking
[2:25:40.520 --> 2:25:41.680]  about Donald Trump.
[2:25:41.680 --> 2:25:46.560]  It talks about a fire to Trump Tower in New York.
[2:25:46.560 --> 2:25:50.600]  It literally mentions the address of Trump Hotel in New York.
[2:25:50.600 --> 2:25:54.680]  It talks about the kid that Ingersoll Lockwood originally wrote about Baron Trump.
[2:25:54.680 --> 2:25:59.560]  Anyway, I'm going off on a jag, but my point is that's wild that you say that, because
[2:25:59.560 --> 2:26:02.200]  I think that everybody's kind of on that same path.
[2:26:02.200 --> 2:26:07.560]  I was actually talking about this last night too, where I think once 2020 hits, it's like
[2:26:07.560 --> 2:26:08.840]  a flash point.
[2:26:08.840 --> 2:26:14.480]  And I think between 2020 to 2030, the world is going to change so drastically.
[2:26:14.480 --> 2:26:16.520]  Once 2030 gets here, we're not even going to recognize it.
[2:26:16.520 --> 2:26:19.920]  I can't even envision 2030, to be honest with you.
[2:26:19.920 --> 2:26:22.200]  Well, there's a lot of things changing.
[2:26:22.200 --> 2:26:24.520]  I mean, technology is going fast.
[2:26:24.520 --> 2:26:25.520]  That's changing.
[2:26:25.520 --> 2:26:27.480]  You've got the society changing.
[2:26:27.480 --> 2:26:31.520]  I mean, I wouldn't have even written a book like Hard Times Creates Strong Men five years
[2:26:31.520 --> 2:26:32.520]  ago.
[2:26:32.520 --> 2:26:33.520]  I wouldn't even imagine it.
[2:26:33.520 --> 2:26:39.400]  I wouldn't imagine this 10 years ago, but the rate of change is just happening so fast
[2:26:39.400 --> 2:26:43.160]  that we can't even really see what's kind of, I think you're right, Owen.
[2:26:43.160 --> 2:26:50.120]  Now, what do you see in the new youth that's kind of coming up right now that the Gen Zs
[2:26:50.120 --> 2:26:53.760]  that seem to not be buying into the liberal indoctrination seem to be going the opposite
[2:26:53.760 --> 2:26:55.320]  direction?
[2:26:55.320 --> 2:26:58.000]  What do you see in the development of those males?
[2:26:58.000 --> 2:27:02.880]  Well, I think that there's always a backlash with generations.
[2:27:02.880 --> 2:27:08.160]  Things go one way, and then they go the other way, and then they go back and forth like
[2:27:08.160 --> 2:27:09.160]  a pendulum.
[2:27:09.160 --> 2:27:14.680]  So, it's kind of like when I was younger, my dad was a downhill skier.
[2:27:14.680 --> 2:27:20.800]  When we rejected downhill skiing, my generation became snowboarders, and now the young kids
[2:27:20.800 --> 2:27:23.800]  are rejecting snowboarding, going back to skiing.
[2:27:23.800 --> 2:27:30.440]  So whatever the liberalism being so popular, if that's popular now, the next generation
[2:27:30.440 --> 2:27:34.480]  is going to find all the holes in it, and we're going to go back in the other direction.
[2:27:34.480 --> 2:27:39.040]  So I think it's actually pretty hopeful, and the Gen Zs are, they're pretty smart young
[2:27:39.040 --> 2:27:41.720]  people, and I've actually got a lot of them hired in my company.
[2:27:41.720 --> 2:27:42.720]  All right, final question.
[2:27:42.720 --> 2:27:43.800]  We've got 60 seconds.
[2:27:43.800 --> 2:27:48.240]  If you could give young men listening to the show a bit of advice, what would it be?
[2:27:48.240 --> 2:27:53.960]  Well, I think that they have to define what it means to be a man, and number one is your
[2:27:53.960 --> 2:27:56.120]  purpose is your work.
[2:27:56.120 --> 2:28:00.680]  So find your purpose, find your work, and read hard times.
[2:28:00.680 --> 2:28:01.680]  Create strong men.
[2:28:01.680 --> 2:28:05.600]  It'll straighten you out in money, sex, religion, and politics.
[2:28:05.600 --> 2:28:10.480]  Yeah, and they try to make it like this bad thing if you write about being a man, and
[2:28:10.480 --> 2:28:13.600]  it's just like what men aren't allowed to have, it's like men aren't allowed to have
[2:28:13.600 --> 2:28:16.280]  men's clubs or go to a cigar club.
[2:28:16.280 --> 2:28:20.520]  But no, they don't want it, you know, they don't want that anymore, and you know why.
[2:28:20.520 --> 2:28:24.600]  You highlight it in your book, Hard Times, Strong Men.com is the website, Stefan Arnio.
[2:28:24.600 --> 2:28:27.120]  Hey, thank you so much for joining me today.
[2:28:27.120 --> 2:28:28.120]  Thanks, Owen.
[2:28:28.120 --> 2:28:29.120]  A great beard.
[2:28:29.120 --> 2:28:30.120]  Well, thank you.
[2:28:30.120 --> 2:28:35.560]  Well, does this pass, does this pass the strong times, great hard men test this beard?
[2:28:35.560 --> 2:28:36.560]  Yeah, bro.
[2:28:36.560 --> 2:28:37.560]  You got better sides in me.
[2:28:37.560 --> 2:28:38.560]  My signs are kind of patched.
[2:28:38.560 --> 2:28:40.280]  I need some of that to supplement yourself.
[2:28:40.280 --> 2:28:42.000]  Yeah, you've got to get the super mill vitality.
[2:28:42.000 --> 2:28:43.960]  All right, I'll give my secret away.
[2:28:43.960 --> 2:28:46.000]  I just rub it all over my face.

[2:28:47.000 --> 2:28:49.200]  I actually shaved this morning.
[2:28:49.200 --> 2:28:50.200]  I shaved this morning.
[2:28:50.200 --> 2:28:53.360]  I had a bare face, and then I just rubbed super mill vitality, and this is what I got.
[2:28:53.360 --> 2:28:54.360]  I don't know how it happened.
[2:28:54.360 --> 2:28:55.360]  It's crazy.
[2:28:55.360 --> 2:28:57.000]  Fully cooked, ready to eat bacon.

[2:32:03.200 --> 2:32:07.320]  backed up with human waste and debris.
[2:32:07.320 --> 2:32:13.000]  This is from people flushing things that aren't meant to be flushed like baby wipes and feminine
[2:32:13.000 --> 2:32:19.440]  products and safe sex products and so this is resulting in pipes being backed up and
[2:32:19.440 --> 2:32:20.440]  clogged.
[2:32:20.440 --> 2:32:25.600]  Well, just like plumbing gets clogged and just like pipes get clogged, the human body

[2:33:06.400 --> 2:33:19.200]  Broadcasting live from the UN Stronghold, Austin, Texas.
[2:33:19.200 --> 2:33:25.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show and now your host, Owen Troyer.
[2:33:25.040 --> 2:33:29.280]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, this is the final segment where I'm going to be live in
[2:33:29.280 --> 2:33:30.280]  the next segment.
[2:33:30.280 --> 2:33:40.480]  I'm pitching to a breakdown I did of an Ilhan Omar statement on the Hill and then Tom Pappert
[2:33:40.480 --> 2:33:42.640]  is going to be taking over for the fourth hour.
[2:33:42.640 --> 2:33:49.280]  I've got some news I want to get to here but first, we've got powerful footage.
[2:33:49.280 --> 2:33:53.000]  This is an incredible video we have right here.
[2:33:53.000 --> 2:34:02.440]  They were airing Teresa May's resignation video live at a popular bar in Britain and
[2:34:02.440 --> 2:34:13.760]  let's see the results.
[2:34:13.760 --> 2:34:16.000]  That pretty much says it all right there.
[2:34:16.000 --> 2:34:24.600]  So May steps down and Britain celebrates its independence from a pathetic week leader.
[2:34:24.600 --> 2:34:32.240]  All right, let's do some news here before Tom Pappert takes over in the fourth hour.
[2:34:32.240 --> 2:34:39.240]  Oh, speaking of Jerry Nadler who passed out during a press conference today, he says,
[2:34:39.240 --> 2:34:41.640]  Mueller wants to testify in private.
[2:34:41.640 --> 2:34:43.600]  Oh, imagine my shock.
[2:34:43.600 --> 2:34:47.480]  Oh, you're telling me that they don't want Mueller to testify in public?
[2:34:47.480 --> 2:34:49.560]  Oh, wow, shocking.
[2:34:49.560 --> 2:34:53.000]  You're telling me they're delaying Mueller's testimony because they're trying to get all
[2:34:53.000 --> 2:34:56.280]  their ducks in a row for all the crime and treason they committed?
[2:34:56.280 --> 2:34:58.160]  Oh, shocking.
[2:34:58.160 --> 2:35:03.680]  Well, the bad news for them is it's not going to work.
[2:35:03.680 --> 2:35:09.920]  But you know, speaking of the Mueller report, journalist Tim Young pointed this out.
[2:35:09.920 --> 2:35:14.760]  From the Mueller report, not only did it find no collusion, they found Putin complaining
[2:35:14.760 --> 2:35:18.280]  that it was difficult for Russian government to get in touch with the Trump admin.
[2:35:18.280 --> 2:35:23.160]  Quote from the Mueller report, Putin spoke of the difficulty faced by the Russian government
[2:35:23.160 --> 2:35:26.160]  in getting in touch with the incoming Trump administration.
[2:35:26.160 --> 2:35:31.680]  According to Avon, Putin indicated that he did not know with whom formally to speak and
[2:35:31.680 --> 2:35:34.680]  generally did not know the people around the president elect.
[2:35:34.680 --> 2:35:38.080]  So they want to create a wedge in between the United States and Russia, which should
[2:35:38.080 --> 2:35:41.720]  be natural allies.
[2:35:41.720 --> 2:35:48.920]  And of course, it's all ridiculous because they use the whole WikiLeaks angle.
[2:35:48.920 --> 2:35:49.920]  Think about this, actually.
[2:35:49.920 --> 2:35:51.680]  Oh, my gosh.
[2:35:51.680 --> 2:35:58.000]  So first they said that WikiLeaks was the connection between Trump and Russia.
[2:35:58.000 --> 2:36:02.280]  Well, Trump is about to have the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, thrown in jail for
[2:36:02.280 --> 2:36:03.560]  the rest of his life.
[2:36:03.560 --> 2:36:06.560]  So does that bury that narrative?
[2:36:06.560 --> 2:36:16.400]  Of course, it already should have been buried because why would Trump have to be communicating
[2:36:16.400 --> 2:36:20.320]  with WikiLeaks or working with WikiLeaks if he's in direct contact with Putin?
[2:36:20.320 --> 2:36:24.920]  Of course, none of it makes sense.
[2:36:24.920 --> 2:36:27.960]  Trump moves to escalate investigation of intel agencies.
[2:36:27.960 --> 2:36:31.200]  Trump orders intel agencies to assist a bar with the review of Russia probe.
[2:36:31.200 --> 2:36:33.000]  And today he announced he's declassifying all of it.
[2:36:33.000 --> 2:36:35.040]  So they're all going to get exposed.
[2:36:35.040 --> 2:36:38.320]  Now, we've seen this in the past, and this is why Trey Gowdy resigned.
[2:36:38.320 --> 2:36:41.840]  You can point out all the crimes of these people, but if there's no prosecutor willing
[2:36:41.840 --> 2:36:43.760]  to prosecute, nothing happens.
[2:36:43.760 --> 2:36:45.520]  And it looks like Joe Biden is going to be involved in this.
[2:36:45.520 --> 2:36:49.760]  Joe Biden reportedly involved in controversial early stages of 2016 Rush Pope.
[2:36:49.760 --> 2:36:50.760]  Yeah, of course.
[2:36:50.760 --> 2:36:51.760]  He was Obama's vice president.
[2:36:51.760 --> 2:36:54.360]  What do you think this is?
[2:36:54.360 --> 2:36:55.640]  Biden knew everything that was going on.
[2:36:55.640 --> 2:36:57.920]  That's why he's running.
[2:36:57.920 --> 2:37:00.040]  He's running as a cover-up.
[2:37:00.040 --> 2:37:05.840]  In fact, the entire Biden campaign is a cover-up.
[2:37:05.840 --> 2:37:08.400]  There is no legitimate chance Joe Biden can win.
[2:37:08.400 --> 2:37:09.840]  Let me tell you something.
[2:37:09.840 --> 2:37:16.440]  These polls that they're running, these polls that they're running that say Biden is ahead
[2:37:16.440 --> 2:37:19.560]  of anybody are all fake.
[2:37:19.560 --> 2:37:22.360]  And so that tells you that they want Biden.
[2:37:22.360 --> 2:37:26.800]  And so that tells you Biden's in it to cover up for the crimes of Obama.
[2:37:26.800 --> 2:37:28.680]  Or they might do a bait and switch at the last minute.
[2:37:28.680 --> 2:37:37.000]  But right now, the establishment is clearly pushing Biden, the egregiousness of even a
[2:37:37.000 --> 2:37:38.040]  Fox News.
[2:37:38.040 --> 2:37:42.920]  They put out a poll saying, in Pennsylvania, Biden is ahead of Trump by five points.
[2:37:42.920 --> 2:37:48.160]  Biden went to Pennsylvania at a crowded park on a beautiful day in Philadelphia and got
[2:37:48.160 --> 2:37:50.440]  a couple hundred people to show up to his event.
[2:37:50.440 --> 2:37:53.640]  Most people were just there at the park that day and walked over.
[2:37:53.640 --> 2:37:55.080]  And that was in Philadelphia.
[2:37:55.080 --> 2:38:02.520]  Up goes to the middle of Pennsylvania, not in the major city, has a rally, 30,000 people.
[2:38:02.520 --> 2:38:07.240]  And then Fox News, I mean, obviously the fake news, CNN, MSNBC, all of them are going to,
[2:38:07.240 --> 2:38:13.960]  but even Fox News puts out polls saying Biden is ahead of Trump.
[2:38:13.960 --> 2:38:19.280]  I guess some at Fox News are hedging their bets.
[2:38:19.280 --> 2:38:23.760]  You know, most people that go on Fox News just read off a teleprompter.
[2:38:23.760 --> 2:38:27.920]  I don't want to name names because I think they're good people.
[2:38:27.920 --> 2:38:35.720]  And then you have the actual patriots like Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, who are,
[2:38:35.720 --> 2:38:46.080]  and then you could throw Lou Dobbs in there, Laura Ingram at times, who are just committed
[2:38:46.080 --> 2:38:50.240]  to exposing the deep state and exposing the left.
[2:38:50.240 --> 2:38:51.240]  Most other people, they're in it.
[2:38:51.240 --> 2:38:52.240]  It's a job.
[2:38:52.240 --> 2:38:54.400]  They read off the teleprompter.
[2:38:54.400 --> 2:38:56.760]  Some of them are anti-Trump like a Shep Smith.
[2:38:56.760 --> 2:38:59.720]  Some of them will say what they're told to.
[2:38:59.720 --> 2:39:05.760]  Most of them won't cross any lines they're not supposed to.
[2:39:05.760 --> 2:39:10.440]  So I just wonder though, is Fox News really hedging their bet in case they don't think
[2:39:10.440 --> 2:39:11.440]  Trump wins?
[2:39:11.440 --> 2:39:13.720]  But remember, Fox News didn't support Trump.
[2:39:13.720 --> 2:39:18.800]  Again, I mean, look, we're not in a popularity contest here.
[2:39:18.800 --> 2:39:25.240]  So we don't care that if you want to compare us to Fox News, we were responsible for getting
[2:39:25.240 --> 2:39:26.560]  Trump in office.
[2:39:26.560 --> 2:39:31.000]  If it was Fox, Trump would have never been president.
[2:39:31.000 --> 2:39:34.960]  Now who does Trump give the time of day to, Fox News?
[2:39:34.960 --> 2:39:37.240]  But that's fine.
[2:39:37.240 --> 2:39:40.080]  We know we're the dark night.
[2:39:40.080 --> 2:39:45.120]  But the president is starting to see how Fox is hedging their bets and putting out fake
[2:39:45.120 --> 2:39:47.240]  polls to try and destroy him.
[2:39:47.240 --> 2:39:50.640]  All right, let's look at some crazy culture news here.
[2:39:50.640 --> 2:39:55.200]  Teachers slammed for donning some breros and mustaches in yearbook photo.
[2:39:55.200 --> 2:39:57.680]  So you're just, you're not allowed to have any fun at school anymore.
[2:39:57.680 --> 2:40:02.000]  So the World Language Facility, obviously they teach Spanish.
[2:40:02.000 --> 2:40:08.000]  One of them dressed up like a madame and the rest of them dressed up as seniors or senior
[2:40:08.000 --> 2:40:13.320]  readers and they put on some breros and a mustache and had some fun.
[2:40:13.320 --> 2:40:15.960]  You're not allowed to have fun, racist.
[2:40:15.960 --> 2:40:17.440]  What a joke.
[2:40:17.440 --> 2:40:22.040]  Like that's what I'm saying, 10 years ago you do something like that, nobody blinks
[2:40:22.040 --> 2:40:23.040]  an eye.
[2:40:23.040 --> 2:40:25.960]  Now all of a sudden it's racist.
[2:40:25.960 --> 2:40:26.960]  Thanks left.
[2:40:26.960 --> 2:40:27.960]  Thanks, Obama.
[2:40:27.960 --> 2:40:31.560]  Here's a, this shocked me.
[2:40:31.560 --> 2:40:34.640]  Powder Kagan Dayton, Ohio City braces for KKK rally.
[2:40:34.640 --> 2:40:38.880]  I really couldn't believe this, but there's actually a KKK rally happening in Ohio and
[2:40:38.880 --> 2:40:42.880]  I'm sitting here thinking to myself, how does this happen?
[2:40:42.880 --> 2:40:46.440]  How can the KKK actually get away with having a rally?
[2:40:46.440 --> 2:40:48.560]  Think about it.
[2:40:48.560 --> 2:40:56.600]  If you plan a rally to support Trump, if you plan a rally to support Trump, leftists are
[2:40:56.600 --> 2:41:00.000]  going to show up and violently attack you, okay?
[2:41:00.000 --> 2:41:04.240]  I'm wondering if any of us are going to show up, seriously, the KKK should not be able
[2:41:04.240 --> 2:41:05.240]  to have a rally.
[2:41:05.240 --> 2:41:06.240]  I mean, this is nuts.
[2:41:06.240 --> 2:41:09.840]  If I lived in Ohio, I would be going to this because here's my theory.
[2:41:09.840 --> 2:41:14.960]  I think that these people claiming to be in the KKK are just agitators.
[2:41:14.960 --> 2:41:19.960]  Who in their right mind goes out in a KKK outfit?
[2:41:19.960 --> 2:41:27.440]  So I, you know, I don't, I don't condone political violence, but like, I mean, they're
[2:41:27.440 --> 2:41:28.760]  going to have a KKK mark.
[2:41:28.760 --> 2:41:33.280]  I would go out there with a microphone, I'd say, really dude, you're here with the KKK?
[2:41:33.280 --> 2:41:41.720]  Really dude, you, really, or are you just an instigator, are you just an agitator?
[2:41:41.720 --> 2:41:43.220]  That's my guess.
[2:41:43.220 --> 2:41:48.200]  Senator Maisie Harono says she spoke to eighth graders about how abortion rights are under
[2:41:48.200 --> 2:41:49.200]  attack.
[2:41:49.200 --> 2:41:52.600]  Oh, really becoming of Maisie Harono from Hawaii.
[2:41:52.600 --> 2:41:57.920]  Again, there is no bill of right that you can cite that says you're allowed to have
[2:41:57.920 --> 2:42:00.600]  an abortion.
[2:42:00.600 --> 2:42:06.720]  But the right to life, liberty, and happiness, that is a founding principle.
[2:42:06.720 --> 2:42:09.880]  But the right to an abortion is not, but not if you ask the Democrats.
[2:42:09.880 --> 2:42:16.600]  All right, this story was just handed to me from kellenmcreen at infowords.com, Vietnam
[2:42:16.600 --> 2:42:21.680]  War Memorial vandalized on Memorial Day weekend, swastikas drawn on monuments, flags thrown
[2:42:21.680 --> 2:42:24.280]  into puddles, and bushes ripped from earth.
[2:42:24.280 --> 2:42:29.560]  So there you go, a bunch of leftists are out desecrating war memorials now, which of course
[2:42:29.560 --> 2:42:36.620]  they've been doing for a while, you know, the last guest talked about a tough time coming
[2:42:36.620 --> 2:42:37.620]  for men.
[2:42:37.620 --> 2:42:43.360]  Folks, I don't want to say it, but let me tell you something, if you're going to be
[2:42:43.360 --> 2:42:48.920]  going around desecrating war memorials, someone's going to pop you in the mouth, so you better
[2:42:48.920 --> 2:42:49.920]  watch out.
[2:42:49.920 --> 2:42:55.560]  All right, my breakdown of Bill Honomore on the other side and then Tom Pappert.
[2:42:55.560 --> 2:43:00.080]  Everybody knows that supplements are amazing, that what God gave us from other nature is
[2:43:00.080 --> 2:43:01.080]  incredible.
[2:43:01.080 --> 2:43:04.200]  That's why supplements are the biggest growing industry in the world, and the globalists
[2:43:04.200 --> 2:43:05.680]  are so upset.
[2:43:05.680 --> 2:43:09.800]  The problem is people forget to take them.
[2:43:09.800 --> 2:43:13.640]  And that's why the whole industry has moved towards packets that you take in the morning
[2:43:13.640 --> 2:43:14.640]  and you take at night.
[2:43:14.640 --> 2:43:19.760]  So we looked at that, we made the very best AM and PM packets out there with an incredible

[2:43:53.720 --> 2:43:56.240]  the price.

[2:44:56.280 --> 2:45:00.440]  The globalist are hyper competitive, scientific dictators.
[2:45:00.440 --> 2:45:01.520]  They are technocrats.
[2:45:01.520 --> 2:45:05.320]  They are control freaks in their own words and they believe allowing you to live your
[2:45:05.320 --> 2:45:09.840]  own life and make your own decisions, it's for the way of their great destiny to merge
[2:45:09.840 --> 2:45:10.840]  with AI gods.
[2:45:10.840 --> 2:45:14.480]  Now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace, we're fighting them hard right here in the
[2:45:14.480 --> 2:45:15.480]  third dimension.
[2:45:15.480 --> 2:45:19.360]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of
[2:45:19.360 --> 2:45:22.000]  control in our lives is our bodies.
[2:45:22.000 --> 2:45:27.280]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from infoworslife.com, I couldn't do it.
[2:45:27.280 --> 2:45:31.600]  That's why we decided to take our original secret 12 that was incredibly high quality
[2:45:31.600 --> 2:45:37.320]  medical bottom and double the strength of it in a new formula, ultra 12.
[2:45:37.320 --> 2:45:42.120]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over the counter that you're
[2:45:42.120 --> 2:45:43.120]  going to find anywhere.
[2:45:43.120 --> 2:45:48.000]  It is amazing, experience pure medical bottom and B12 for yourself and fund the second
[2:45:48.000 --> 2:45:54.280]  American Revolution against the tyrants at infoworsstore.com, infoworslife.com or triple
[2:45:54.280 --> 2:45:56.560]  a 253 3139.
[2:45:56.560 --> 2:46:03.280]  It would take me more than an hour just to lay out all the admitted benefits and known
[2:46:03.280 --> 2:46:08.560]  positive effects of just one of the ingredients in our ultimate bone broth formula.
[2:46:08.560 --> 2:46:13.760]  Everybody knows about bone broth itself and all of the amazing things that it's associated
[2:46:13.760 --> 2:46:14.760]  with.
[2:46:14.760 --> 2:46:16.720]  And then it's been the big craze for at least a decade.
[2:46:16.720 --> 2:46:20.440]  A thousand years ago, it's what everybody told people they should drink in a soup if
[2:46:20.440 --> 2:46:21.440]  they were sick.
[2:46:21.440 --> 2:46:25.280]  But then you add not just the fact that this is the strongest, most concentrated, highest
[2:46:25.280 --> 2:46:30.440]  quality bone broth out there, literally, then you have the chaga mushroom, then you have
[2:46:30.440 --> 2:46:34.600]  the turmeric, then you have the bee pollen, then you have the other key ingredients that
[2:46:34.600 --> 2:46:39.640]  are all known to just make people incredibly strong and healthy.
[2:46:39.640 --> 2:46:41.880]  Our ultimate bone broth formula is amazing.
[2:46:41.880 --> 2:46:46.000]  It's 50% off right now at infoworsstore.com because I want you to try it and see how great
[2:46:46.000 --> 2:46:47.000]  it is.
[2:46:47.000 --> 2:46:49.640]  And of course, getting the bone broth isn't just great for you and your family.
[2:46:49.640 --> 2:46:54.240]  It's also amazing when it comes to funding our operation that's taken on the globalists
[2:46:54.240 --> 2:46:58.920]  and fighting for all of our freedoms.
[2:46:58.920 --> 2:47:25.760]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:30:47.780 --> 2:47:53.840]  that not what she does with Islam all the time?
[2:47:53.840 --> 2:47:56.440]  I mean, so, so just again, I want you to just keep this.
[2:47:56.440 --> 2:47:57.880]  This is a pattern here.
[2:47:57.880 --> 2:47:59.800]  She's projecting everything.
[2:47:59.800 --> 2:48:03.320]  She's reverse engineering everything and then projecting it.
[2:48:03.320 --> 2:48:04.320]  This is a method.
[2:48:04.320 --> 2:48:07.320]  This is a mechanism.
[2:48:07.320 --> 2:48:18.320]  All right, I want to play this clip of Ilhan Omar here.
[2:48:18.320 --> 2:48:26.360]  And I realized something about Ilhan Omar hearing this clip that I will explain at the
[2:48:26.360 --> 2:48:34.200]  conclusion of it, but here is Ilhan Omar on the House floor yesterday.
[2:48:34.200 --> 2:48:40.960]  Religious fundamentalists are currently trying to manipulate state laws in order to impose
[2:48:40.960 --> 2:48:49.400]  their beliefs on an entire society, all with complete disregard for voices and the rights
[2:48:49.400 --> 2:48:51.400]  of American women.
[2:48:51.400 --> 2:49:00.080]  The recent efforts like those in Alabama in Georgia are only the latest in a long history
[2:49:00.080 --> 2:49:07.840]  of efforts to criminalize women and rewind it five seconds.
[2:49:07.840 --> 2:49:09.880]  That's not your state.
[2:49:09.880 --> 2:49:12.880]  Let them decide what they want to do in their own state.
[2:49:12.880 --> 2:49:18.280]  But listen to her go on here as she tries to incite civil war in this country are only
[2:49:18.280 --> 2:49:26.720]  the latest in a long history of efforts to criminalize women for simply existing.
[2:49:26.720 --> 2:49:28.360]  Pause it right there.
[2:49:28.360 --> 2:49:34.200]  Why don't you go to Iran and take your hijab off?
[2:49:34.200 --> 2:49:37.400]  You want to talk about a country that punishes women for existing?
[2:49:37.400 --> 2:49:43.200]  Why don't you go to Saudi Arabia and walk around without your hijab or your man?
[2:49:43.200 --> 2:49:47.840]  Why don't you go to Somalia without your hijab and walk around on the beach?
[2:49:47.840 --> 2:49:50.880]  How long before you're turned into a sex slave, you think?
[2:49:50.880 --> 2:49:59.520]  And then she's going to come here as a Somalian refugee and talk to us about female oppression.
[2:49:59.520 --> 2:50:01.480]  But I realize something after this speech.
[2:50:01.480 --> 2:50:02.480]  I'll explain.
[2:50:02.480 --> 2:50:04.960]  So go on.
[2:50:04.960 --> 2:50:10.600]  When we don't conform to their attempts to control us, but because it's happening here
[2:50:10.600 --> 2:50:15.960]  with the support of the ultra conservative, pause right there, rewind it 10 seconds because
[2:50:15.960 --> 2:50:18.200]  I'm sorry, I kind of cut that off at a bad time.
[2:50:18.200 --> 2:50:21.840]  Listen, listen to what she says here.
[2:50:21.840 --> 2:50:26.640]  She's actually describing Muslim countries and the oppression of women and then projecting
[2:50:26.640 --> 2:50:31.040]  that onto the West that liberated women, including women such as herself.
[2:50:31.040 --> 2:50:33.640]  But there's a reason why she still wears the hijab.
[2:50:33.640 --> 2:50:35.080]  There's a reason why she projects that.
[2:50:35.080 --> 2:50:36.080]  I'm going to explain at the end.
[2:50:36.080 --> 2:50:37.080]  All right.
[2:50:37.080 --> 2:50:38.080]  Go back.
[2:50:38.080 --> 2:50:44.600]  Existing to punish us when we don't conform to their attempts to control us.
[2:50:44.600 --> 2:50:50.040]  But because it's happening here with the support of the ultra conservative religious
[2:50:50.040 --> 2:50:52.880]  right, we call it religious freedom.
[2:50:52.880 --> 2:50:55.040]  It's simply unthinkable.
[2:50:55.040 --> 2:50:59.320]  Let's just be honest for the religious right.
[2:50:59.320 --> 2:51:05.920]  This isn't simply about their care or concern for life.
[2:51:05.920 --> 2:51:14.440]  If they cared about or were concerned about children, they would be concerned about the
[2:51:14.440 --> 2:51:23.360]  children that are being detained and those that are dying in camps across our borders.
[2:51:23.360 --> 2:51:32.040]  Or the children who are languishing in hunger and facing homelessness, pause it as if that's
[2:51:32.040 --> 2:51:33.680]  our responsibility now.
[2:51:33.680 --> 2:51:37.160]  So anyone from any country, if you're hungry, just come on up.
[2:51:37.160 --> 2:51:38.160]  You're our responsibility.
[2:51:38.160 --> 2:51:42.560]  If you need clothes, if you need a home, you got 10 kids that need a mouse to feed, just
[2:51:42.560 --> 2:51:46.480]  come on up, somehow that's our responsibility now, which, by the way, again, we do the most
[2:51:46.480 --> 2:51:47.480]  humanitarian aid in the world.
[2:51:47.480 --> 2:51:48.480]  It's not even close.
[2:51:48.480 --> 2:51:49.480]  We do take a lot of these people.
[2:51:49.480 --> 2:51:50.480]  We can't afford it.
[2:51:50.480 --> 2:51:51.480]  It's killing our economy.
[2:51:51.480 --> 2:51:54.000]  It's killing our culture.
[2:51:54.000 --> 2:51:58.520]  It's making a more third world population, diseases spreading, but that's our responsibility
[2:51:58.520 --> 2:51:59.520]  to do that.
[2:51:59.520 --> 2:52:01.520]  You see, that's what we have to do according to Ilhan.
[2:52:01.520 --> 2:52:02.520]  All right.
[2:52:02.520 --> 2:52:03.520]  Go on.
[2:52:03.520 --> 2:52:09.400]  Just more morality or conviction because we've seen time and time again.
[2:52:09.400 --> 2:52:10.600]  Morality as they preach abortion.
[2:52:10.600 --> 2:52:16.240]  Those that talk about their faith and want to push policies because of their faith are
[2:52:16.240 --> 2:52:23.800]  the ones that simply are caught with the hypocrisy of not living it out in their personal lives.
[2:52:23.800 --> 2:52:32.440]  I am frustrated every single time I hear people speaking about their faith and pushing that
[2:52:32.440 --> 2:52:34.160]  onto other people.
[2:52:34.160 --> 2:52:35.720]  Pause it.
[2:52:35.720 --> 2:52:39.720]  Is that not what she does with Islam all the time?
[2:52:39.720 --> 2:52:43.800]  I mean, so just again, I want you to just keep this, this is a pattern here.
[2:52:43.800 --> 2:52:45.720]  She's projecting everything.
[2:52:45.720 --> 2:52:49.240]  She's reverse engineering everything and then projecting it.
[2:52:49.240 --> 2:52:50.240]  This is a method.
[2:52:50.240 --> 2:52:51.240]  This is a mechanism.
[2:52:51.240 --> 2:52:52.240]  All right.
[2:52:52.240 --> 2:52:53.240]  Finish it.
[2:52:53.240 --> 2:53:02.040]  Those so-called religious politicians, when it comes to their life, their choices, they
[2:53:02.040 --> 2:53:04.360]  want to talk about freedom.
[2:53:04.360 --> 2:53:09.440]  But when it comes to other people's lives and other people's choices, they want to talk
[2:53:09.440 --> 2:53:12.120]  about religion.
[2:53:12.120 --> 2:53:17.120]  So here's what you can learn from that or here's what I learned from that.
[2:53:17.120 --> 2:53:22.360]  There's two things that are conclusively true about that, perhaps either both things or
[2:53:22.360 --> 2:53:25.600]  at least one of the two.
[2:53:25.600 --> 2:53:31.120]  Ilhan Omar has an extremely low IQ and I mean extremely low.
[2:53:31.120 --> 2:53:33.760]  And you know, part of that's probably not her fault.
[2:53:33.760 --> 2:53:37.760]  She grew up in Somalia, obviously didn't get a good education, learned English at an
[2:53:37.760 --> 2:53:39.520]  older age.
[2:53:39.520 --> 2:53:44.280]  So you know, we try not to hold that against her so much, but you can tell.
[2:53:44.280 --> 2:53:49.880]  But even probably just IQ ability wise, she's very, very low on the scale.
[2:53:49.880 --> 2:53:56.480]  She's in the same IQ category as a Don Lemon per se, very low wattage light bulb.
[2:53:56.480 --> 2:54:04.800]  So that could be true and this or perhaps just this, but I'm more convinced of this
[2:54:04.800 --> 2:54:10.200]  now than ever after hearing this clip and kind of actually breaking it down.
[2:54:10.200 --> 2:54:18.920]  Ilhan Omar is an operative and an active operative against this country.
[2:54:18.920 --> 2:54:25.160]  And it's more clear to me now than ever because you don't go up and say that kind of stuff
[2:54:25.160 --> 2:54:28.600]  unless you're intentionally instigating.
[2:54:28.600 --> 2:54:29.960]  Now I don't know what that means.
[2:54:29.960 --> 2:54:31.200]  I don't know.
[2:54:31.200 --> 2:54:32.960]  You'll have people say she's an Israeli operative.
[2:54:32.960 --> 2:54:36.880]  You'll have people say she's a operative of Hamas, operative of the Muslim Brotherhood,
[2:54:36.880 --> 2:54:39.400]  this that or the other thing, radical Islam.
[2:54:39.400 --> 2:54:40.600]  I don't know what it is.
[2:54:40.600 --> 2:54:48.240]  She is clearly trying to incite civil war in this country with her rhetoric every day.
[2:54:48.240 --> 2:54:54.760]  When you twist reality like that and when you project that out to the public, you are
[2:54:54.760 --> 2:55:00.320]  openly engaging in sedition against this country.
[2:55:00.320 --> 2:55:04.520]  And I realize that now more than ever, that's what's happening here because I've always
[2:55:04.520 --> 2:55:10.480]  asked, why does Ilhan Omar wear the hijab but not Rashida Tlaab?
[2:55:10.480 --> 2:55:12.320]  Because Ilhan Omar is an operative.
[2:55:12.320 --> 2:55:14.720]  Ilhan Omar is literally there to anger you.
[2:55:14.720 --> 2:55:19.000]  Ilhan Omar is literally there to tell you you lost to Muslims.
[2:55:19.000 --> 2:55:23.880]  Ilhan Omar is literally here to say we're coming to your country and she tells you.
[2:55:23.880 --> 2:55:30.880]  But see, she blames you for being hateful and Islamophobic if you don't like it when
[2:55:30.880 --> 2:55:37.840]  you've got this story today that's been going for mainstream for the last two days, I think.
[2:55:37.840 --> 2:55:41.320]  American Taliban lind released as Afghan war still boils.
[2:55:41.320 --> 2:55:45.800]  So any of the stories you read about this, it's the same thing.
[2:55:45.800 --> 2:55:53.360]  This guy converted to a radical Muslim and this is all happening during the Afghan wars,
[2:55:53.360 --> 2:55:55.480]  which was a result of what?
[2:55:55.480 --> 2:55:59.120]  September 11th, 2001, which was blamed on what?
[2:55:59.120 --> 2:56:05.400]  Radical Islamic terrorists that hate the West, hate our way of life and want us all to die.
[2:56:05.400 --> 2:56:09.120]  That narrative has never been changed.
[2:56:09.120 --> 2:56:11.880]  The 9-11 Commission has never been changed.
[2:56:11.880 --> 2:56:18.720]  We're still told we're at war with radical Islamic terror, yet if you say that though,
[2:56:18.720 --> 2:56:20.400]  you're now considered Islamophobic.
[2:56:20.400 --> 2:56:27.960]  So do you see how can you actually have those coexisting truths and consider yourself a logical
[2:56:27.960 --> 2:56:28.960]  human being?
[2:56:28.960 --> 2:56:29.960]  You can't.
[2:56:29.960 --> 2:56:30.960]  It's ridiculous.
[2:56:30.960 --> 2:56:33.520]  But the problem is most people have zero logic or reasoning anymore, so they don't even
[2:56:33.520 --> 2:56:34.520]  think that much.
[2:56:34.520 --> 2:56:39.240]  But you read all the stories about the American Taliban lind guy.
[2:56:39.240 --> 2:56:40.360]  He just got released early.
[2:56:40.360 --> 2:56:46.160]  He'll be under strict watch and it's all about radical Islamic terror on September 11th, 2001.
[2:56:46.160 --> 2:56:51.440]  But if you say that outside of the context of September 11th, 2001, somehow you're Islamophobic,
[2:56:51.440 --> 2:56:54.680]  somehow you're bigoted against Islam.
[2:56:54.680 --> 2:56:58.680]  These are the logical incongruencies that drive me crazy.
[2:56:58.680 --> 2:57:00.800]  A couple more stories here on that.
[2:57:00.800 --> 2:57:06.640]  Iraq's Christians close to extinction, and you can blame this on whatever you want, but
[2:57:06.640 --> 2:57:10.160]  the numbers actually decreased after the U.S. intervention.
[2:57:10.160 --> 2:57:16.000]  So Iran's youth will witness the demise of America and Israel, Ayatollah Khamenei vows
[2:57:16.000 --> 2:57:18.560]  as commander, boast Trump wouldn't dare attack.
[2:57:18.560 --> 2:57:23.240]  Boy, he wouldn't say that unless he knew he had Russia and China having his back.
[2:57:23.240 --> 2:57:27.760]  But I don't know, they've always kind of been extremely harsh with their rhetoric.
[2:57:27.760 --> 2:57:31.560]  So that's just him probably trying to be a tough guy against Trump.
[2:57:31.560 --> 2:57:32.560]  But make no mistake.
[2:57:32.560 --> 2:57:39.560]  I mean, they don't like Israel and they don't like America.
[2:58:32.560 --> 2:58:52.240]  You are the man, Alex.
[2:58:52.240 --> 2:58:53.760]  I'm so glad to be talking to you.
[2:58:53.760 --> 2:58:54.760]  I'm so excited.
[2:58:54.760 --> 2:58:55.760]  I'm such a big fan.
[2:58:55.760 --> 2:58:57.960]  Ever since I've been listening, I've been buying your products.
[2:58:57.960 --> 2:59:00.560]  I got to do a shout out for the bone broth.
[2:59:00.560 --> 2:59:02.560]  The bone broth.
[2:59:02.560 --> 2:59:04.560]  The bone broth.
[2:59:04.560 --> 2:59:06.560]  The bone broth.
[2:59:06.560 --> 2:59:08.560]  Tastes like, tastes like great milkshake.
[2:59:08.560 --> 2:59:10.560]  You know, if you just add it to milk.
[2:59:10.560 --> 2:59:12.560]  It tastes like oval theme.
[2:59:12.560 --> 2:59:14.560]  It tastes like oval theme.
[2:59:14.560 --> 2:59:16.560]  It tastes like oval theme.
[2:59:16.560 --> 2:59:17.560]  Like good.
[2:59:17.560 --> 2:59:19.560]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[2:59:19.560 --> 2:59:22.560]  My daughter uses the bubblegum fluoride-free toothpaste.
[2:59:22.560 --> 2:59:26.560]  I've used the SuperMail Vitality, a host of other products.
[2:59:26.560 --> 2:59:28.560]  So thank you so much for that as well.
[2:59:28.560 --> 2:59:31.560]  Brother, you're thanking me for buying the products and keeping us on air.
[2:59:31.560 --> 2:59:32.560]  I'm thanking you.
[2:59:32.560 --> 2:59:36.560]  But yes, this is the ultimate bone broth formula with the turmeric, the chocolate mushroom,
[2:59:36.560 --> 2:59:38.560]  the true bone broth.
[2:59:38.560 --> 2:59:39.560]  It is next level.
[2:59:39.560 --> 2:59:40.560]  It really is good.
[2:59:40.560 --> 2:59:41.560]  So thank you.
[2:59:41.560 --> 2:59:42.560]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[2:59:42.560 --> 3:00:09.560]  Thank you.
[3:00:09.560 --> 3:00:12.560]  Hello, I am Tom Papert-Billonan for Alex Today.
[3:00:12.560 --> 3:00:15.560]  You'll be back on Sunday with the afternoon broadcast there.
[3:00:15.560 --> 3:00:19.560]  Today is kind of a massive day, not just here in the United States,
[3:00:19.560 --> 3:00:23.560]  where you have massive leftist passing out, and that is not an unintentional pun.
[3:00:23.560 --> 3:00:25.560]  You have leftist passing out.
[3:00:25.560 --> 3:00:29.560]  You have Nancy Pelosi doddering across the pond in the United Kingdom.
[3:00:29.560 --> 3:00:32.560]  Theresa May, prime minister, is stepping down.
[3:00:32.560 --> 3:00:37.560]  The public is overjoyed, shouting, crying tears of joy as this woman,
[3:00:37.560 --> 3:00:41.560]  who has essentially blocked Brexit, covered up pedophile scandals.
[3:00:41.560 --> 3:00:44.560]  She is finally, finally, finally getting out of power there.
[3:00:44.560 --> 3:00:48.560]  But also in Europe, there's been a massive attack.
[3:00:48.560 --> 3:00:54.560]  We do not yet know the circumstances, the perpetrators, the reason behind it.
[3:00:54.560 --> 3:00:58.560]  But I like to point to Coulter's Law in this type of situation,
[3:00:58.560 --> 3:01:04.560]  where the longer we go without finding the name, identity, religion of the perpetrator,
[3:01:04.560 --> 3:01:11.560]  the more likely it is to be radical Islam attacking poor, innocent people yet again.
[3:01:11.560 --> 3:01:13.560]  So we're going to get into that more in the next segment,
[3:01:13.560 --> 3:01:15.560]  but there is a lot to talk about today.
[3:01:15.560 --> 3:01:19.560]  There is more going on with the Facebook and tech censorship angle CrossFit.
[3:01:19.560 --> 3:01:25.560]  Now, believe it or not, CrossFit, of all people, are now boycotting Facebook and Instagram.
[3:01:25.560 --> 3:01:31.560]  After one of their massive groups, it was an affiliate group with 1.65 million users in it,
[3:01:31.560 --> 3:01:34.560]  was banned without reason.
[3:01:34.560 --> 3:01:41.560]  It's absolutely baffling to see our big tech overlords begin to extend this beyond just conservatives.
[3:01:41.560 --> 3:01:46.560]  They've realized, doing it to Alex Jones, doing it to InfoWars, Paul Joseph Watson, Laura Loomer,
[3:01:46.560 --> 3:01:49.560]  Milo Yiannopoulos, Gavin McKenna, so many other names,
[3:01:49.560 --> 3:01:55.560]  I could go into my own little Jerry Nadler dehydration fit if I were to name them all.
[3:01:55.560 --> 3:02:00.560]  But it's fascinating to me that they are using this as their opportunity.
[3:02:00.560 --> 3:02:02.560]  Now, nobody came to the rescue with InfoWars.
[3:02:02.560 --> 3:02:05.560]  President Trump is tweeting. The President's son is tweeting.
[3:02:05.560 --> 3:02:10.560]  People are trying, but nobody in Congress is doing anything meaningful.
[3:02:10.560 --> 3:02:13.560]  Nobody is going to hold these powers accountable.
[3:02:13.560 --> 3:02:20.560]  So now, if you run a health and fitness program that goes contrary to the establishment agenda
[3:02:20.560 --> 3:02:24.560]  for what that should look like, you too can be taken down.
[3:02:24.560 --> 3:02:26.560]  And we've seen this on Twitter now as well.
[3:02:26.560 --> 3:02:32.560]  We're the Krasenstein brothers, the two never-Trump resistance twins
[3:02:32.560 --> 3:02:34.560]  who are always in the President's sub-tweets.
[3:02:34.560 --> 3:02:37.560]  Anytime he tweets, they issue a response.
[3:02:37.560 --> 3:02:43.560]  Well, now they've been banned for allegedly having fake engagement.
[3:02:43.560 --> 3:02:46.560]  They pay people to boost their Twitter profile, which is wrong.
[3:02:46.560 --> 3:02:48.560]  And it's against Twitter's rules.
[3:02:48.560 --> 3:02:54.560]  But I think what it is, is somebody at Twitter HQ decided that they make the left look bad
[3:02:54.560 --> 3:02:57.560]  because they're hysterical. They're never Trump.
[3:02:57.560 --> 3:03:00.560]  They don't want to push any type of actual meaningful change.
[3:03:00.560 --> 3:03:03.560]  They just want to say, orange, man, bad.
[3:03:03.560 --> 3:03:09.560]  And so I think what we're going to see here as we go into the 2020 election and then beyond,
[3:03:09.560 --> 3:03:14.560]  we're going to see social media and big tech flexing its muscles like never before.
[3:03:14.560 --> 3:03:19.560]  If you say anything contrary to what they believe in, they are coming after you.
[3:03:19.560 --> 3:03:23.560]  And of course, they're nothing but the globalist propaganda outlet.
[3:03:23.560 --> 3:03:29.560]  They're nothing but the ideological masters who served the left and are served by the left.
[3:03:29.560 --> 3:03:32.560]  So we know exactly what that's going to look like.
[3:03:32.560 --> 3:03:35.560]  Anybody who is even somewhat of a nationalist is going to be hurt.
[3:03:35.560 --> 3:03:40.560]  I believe Bernie Sanders of all people is being shadow banned because he goes against the wishes
[3:03:40.560 --> 3:03:46.560]  of his Democrat paymasters, the real people in charge.
[3:03:46.560 --> 3:03:48.560]  So all this and more is coming up in the next segment.
[3:03:48.560 --> 3:03:53.560]  Again, I am Tom Papert. This is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show before we take off for a brief break.
[3:03:53.560 --> 3:03:57.560]  I do want to remind everybody this channel info wars.
[3:03:57.560 --> 3:04:00.560]  This platform depends directly on your support.
[3:04:00.560 --> 3:04:06.560]  There are some amazing Memorial Day sales going on right now infowarstore.com is the website.
[3:04:06.560 --> 3:04:10.560]  If you give value out of this programming, you owe it to the team.
[3:04:10.560 --> 3:04:14.560]  The wonderful people making this show happen right now who are behind the scenes working.
[3:04:14.560 --> 3:04:18.560]  You owe it to everyone involved to show your support financially.
[3:04:18.560 --> 3:04:24.560]  If at all possible, share the links, go to the store, go out on the street corner and yell at the top of your lungs.
[3:04:24.560 --> 3:04:28.560]  His name is Alex Jones. We're going to be right back.
[3:04:28.560 --> 3:04:31.560]  I'm Tom Papert. This is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show.
[3:04:31.560 --> 3:04:37.560]  We're going to break down what's happening in France on the other side of the break coming up here in just a couple minutes.
[3:04:37.560 --> 3:04:41.560]  Thank you all so much for watching and thank you all for supporting this broadcast.
[3:04:41.560 --> 3:04:46.560]  We will be back momentarily here on the Alex Jones show.
[3:04:54.560 --> 3:05:01.560]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the Western world's history.
[3:05:01.560 --> 3:05:11.560]  This is a digital, AI-enforced gag order not to say the name Alex Jones or infowars.com.
[3:05:15.560 --> 3:05:19.560]  This is Nazi Germany level. This is racketeering. This is cartels.
[3:05:19.560 --> 3:05:25.560]  Mr. President, we need your help. We need it now. You can take on Big Tech.
[3:05:25.560 --> 3:05:34.560]  They saw infowars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family, populist organization.
[3:05:34.560 --> 3:05:42.560]  So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones, then when people say, okay, take him off the air, everyone else like Domino's would fall.
[3:05:42.560 --> 3:05:48.560]  The way to fight back is to support infowars now more than ever and make it a standard of freedom and free speech.
[3:05:48.560 --> 3:05:56.560]  Understand that they believe they can take us down. They'll take everybody else down.
[3:06:19.560 --> 3:06:24.560]  Let's talk about what's happening across the pond today. There's been another attack.
[3:06:24.560 --> 3:06:31.560]  We do not yet know if it's a terrorist attack, but does it not seem likely based on what's been going on in that poor, poor nation of France?
[3:06:31.560 --> 3:06:38.560]  Donald Trump said in July of 2016, France is no longer France.
[3:06:38.560 --> 3:06:48.560]  And he took a lot of flak for it, but at the time a priest was just stabbed and it was just shortly after a truck attack.
[3:06:48.560 --> 3:06:52.560]  You remember that's how it was described, a truck attack and it was horrifying.
[3:06:52.560 --> 3:06:56.560]  And then the media seemed to get tired of talking about terrorism.
[3:06:56.560 --> 3:07:04.560]  In fact, we had a top-down order from Joe Biden, I believe it was, who said the media should stop talking about terrorism.
[3:07:04.560 --> 3:07:08.560]  The media should stop reporting on all terrorist activities. It just encourages them.
[3:07:08.560 --> 3:07:14.560]  So as a result, we the people have not really known what's been happening, but today there has been another attack.
[3:07:14.560 --> 3:07:19.560]  As I said a moment ago, several injured in parcel bomb attack in France.
[3:07:19.560 --> 3:07:22.560]  We've got an article up at bigleaguepolitics.com.
[3:07:22.560 --> 3:07:29.560]  At least eight people were injured today in a parcel bomb attack in Lyon, France, according to multiple sources.
[3:07:29.560 --> 3:07:38.560]  According to NBC, the explosion happened near Rue Victor Hugo and Solid Street in the third largest city in France, about 300 miles southeast of Paris.
[3:07:38.560 --> 3:07:40.560]  And that is according to the National Police.
[3:07:40.560 --> 3:07:50.560]  French President and universally loathed person Emmanuel Macron described the incident as an attack and has provided no further details.
[3:07:50.560 --> 3:07:54.560]  And again, this is France's third largest city.
[3:07:54.560 --> 3:08:00.560]  The timing is also suspicious, is it not? We are in the month of Ramadan, the holy month for Islam,
[3:08:00.560 --> 3:08:05.560]  which just for some strange reason seems to result in all kinds of terrorist activity.
[3:08:05.560 --> 3:08:08.560]  People being bombed, people being stabbed, people being shot.
[3:08:08.560 --> 3:08:13.560]  And of course, it is worth repeating, we do not yet know the motives behind this attack.
[3:08:13.560 --> 3:08:20.560]  And it will be fascinating to see what comes out of this, exactly what comes of this to learn, whether or not it is Muslim.
[3:08:20.560 --> 3:08:27.560]  But as I said in the last segment, if you happen to be watching, I believe in culture's law, the longer we go without hearing who the perpetrator is,
[3:08:27.560 --> 3:08:34.560]  what their motivation was, what their religion might have been, what their name was, the more likely it is to be Islamic terror.
[3:08:34.560 --> 3:08:39.560]  One witness was a block away. He said, I was a block away when I heard it.
[3:08:39.560 --> 3:08:44.560]  They locked us in the store. I came out 10 minutes later and the police, etc., were arriving.
[3:08:44.560 --> 3:08:49.560]  She described the witness the explosion as like a bomb, extremely loud.
[3:08:49.560 --> 3:08:56.560]  We know that it's a nail bomb. We know that ISIS completely out of its territory.
[3:08:56.560 --> 3:09:01.560]  It's been totally recaptured by President Trump and turned over to slightly less insane people, I would hope.
[3:09:01.560 --> 3:09:07.560]  We know that ISIS is telling its adherence across the globe that now is the time to attack.
[3:09:07.560 --> 3:09:13.560]  They've previously said, run over the people with your vehicle, build a homemade bomb, splash them with acid,
[3:09:13.560 --> 3:09:17.560]  all of this that is happening as we speak across Europe.
[3:09:17.560 --> 3:09:25.560]  And it is almost sad to think of the poor French people where they tried to elect someone,
[3:09:25.560 --> 3:09:29.560]  they tried to elect their own version of President Trump and instead they got the globalist.
[3:09:29.560 --> 3:09:36.560]  Instead they got Macron, who went before global leaders and said, while America is suffering through President Trump,
[3:09:36.560 --> 3:09:39.560]  I will take the place of the United States of America.
[3:09:39.560 --> 3:09:46.560]  Macron, France, we will be the new world leader when it comes to fighting right wing extremism.
[3:09:46.560 --> 3:09:53.560]  France will lead the way. Well, France has been rocked, rocked, rocked by yellow vest protests.
[3:09:53.560 --> 3:09:59.560]  Macron is universally hated among his people. He has some of the lowest approval ratings in the nation's history.
[3:09:59.560 --> 3:10:02.560]  The country is falling apart. There's attack after attack.
[3:10:02.560 --> 3:10:09.560]  Of course, the great cathedral Notre Dame was just had a strange fire, electrical issue apparently.
[3:10:09.560 --> 3:10:14.560]  Electrical issue, would you believe that? Electrical fire last month or maybe it was the month before.
[3:10:14.560 --> 3:10:23.560]  And again, President Trump predicted all of this. I want to turn back to this political article from 2016 because he was absolutely right.
[3:10:23.560 --> 3:10:29.560]  And he said something that I think is very important. He said, you see what happened to the French priest, a friend of mine.
[3:10:29.560 --> 3:10:33.560]  He said he was going to France three or four months ago. I saw him yesterday. I said, how did you like France?
[3:10:33.560 --> 3:10:38.560]  He said, I wouldn't go to France because France is no longer France.
[3:10:38.560 --> 3:10:41.560]  President Trump also said, then candidate Trump, they won't like me for saying that.
[3:10:41.560 --> 3:10:45.560]  But you see what happened in Nice. You see what happened yesterday with the priest who was supposed to be a spectacular man.
[3:10:45.560 --> 3:10:50.560]  France is no longer France. And this world better be very careful.
[3:10:50.560 --> 3:10:57.560]  And they better get very tough and very smart. And they'll never do it with Hillary Clinton.
[3:10:57.560 --> 3:11:01.560]  We haven't really had much terrorism in the United States, have we?
[3:11:01.560 --> 3:11:07.560]  Now, there are certainly lots of questions that may never be answered about what happened in the Las Vegas shooting and other shootings.
[3:11:07.560 --> 3:11:14.560]  But we haven't had a large-scale terrorist attack since President Trump got into office. And that's not for lack of trying.
[3:11:14.560 --> 3:11:18.560]  But I think these people are realizing that it's going to be a whole lot harder nowadays.
[3:11:18.560 --> 3:11:22.560]  Now, as I say that, we have terrorists trying to get through our poorest southern border.
[3:11:22.560 --> 3:11:30.560]  We have ISIS, saber-rattling. We have John Bolton in the White House urging President Trump to go to war just about everywhere in the globe.
[3:11:30.560 --> 3:11:36.560]  Syria, Iran, Venezuela. If it even looks like he's got an opening, he wants war.
[3:11:36.560 --> 3:11:42.560]  But still, the United States, a sharp decline in terrorist attacks, it would seem.
[3:11:42.560 --> 3:11:46.560]  And I wonder what we have enjoyed that under Hillary Clinton.
[3:11:46.560 --> 3:11:53.560]  But this latest attack in France comes only days after a Parisian airport was stormed by migrants.
[3:11:53.560 --> 3:11:57.560]  Migrants, the migrants of peace and protest of deportation.
[3:11:57.560 --> 3:12:02.560]  And is this not the most ironic thing you've ever heard in your life?
[3:12:02.560 --> 3:12:07.560]  France, with the globalist Macron. Well, the migrants are mad at him, too.
[3:12:07.560 --> 3:12:11.560]  It just goes to show there is no way you can make these people happy.
[3:12:11.560 --> 3:12:19.560]  You cannot be a fence-sitter and attempt to make all the leftists and the populace and the migrants and all of these different elements.
[3:12:19.560 --> 3:12:21.560]  You just cannot make them all happy.
[3:12:21.560 --> 3:12:25.560]  And so it pays to be like President Trump. It pays to take a hard-line stance.
[3:12:25.560 --> 3:12:28.560]  This is what someone, one of the migrants, yelled.
[3:12:28.560 --> 3:12:33.560]  France does not belong to the French. Everyone has a right to be here.
[3:12:33.560 --> 3:12:37.560]  Well, President Trump said it in 2016. France is no longer France.
[3:12:37.560 --> 3:12:40.560]  Well, France is no longer French, according to this migrant.
[3:12:40.560 --> 3:12:45.560]  The protest was organized by an open borders group called Collective de Chapelle Debout,
[3:12:45.560 --> 3:12:49.560]  which streamed the event live on its Facebook. They're allowed to Facebook.
[3:12:49.560 --> 3:12:53.560]  The protest is referred to Air France as the official deporter of the French state
[3:12:53.560 --> 3:12:58.560]  and demanded to speak with Édouard Philippe, French President Emmanuel Macron's prime minister.
[3:12:58.560 --> 3:13:03.560]  Quote, several hundred done documents and migrants invade Terminal 2 at Roissy Airport
[3:13:03.560 --> 3:13:07.560]  to denounce evictions and the treatment of undocumented migrants,
[3:13:07.560 --> 3:13:09.560]  use of tear gas by police officers.
[3:13:09.560 --> 3:13:16.560]  They want to talk to the CEO of Air France and the prime minister, said French journalist Rameeb Wessin.
[3:13:16.560 --> 3:13:21.560]  I just think it's so precious these globalist states are crumbling,
[3:13:21.560 --> 3:13:24.560]  and it's their own destruction. It's their own undoing.
[3:13:24.560 --> 3:13:28.560]  Remember, we have to bring the migrants in because populations are declining
[3:13:28.560 --> 3:13:32.560]  and we need a new tax base, so you bring these people in. You get totally overrun.
[3:13:32.560 --> 3:13:35.560]  You realize that they have no skills. They bring nothing to the table.
[3:13:35.560 --> 3:13:37.560]  They want your handouts and nothing else.
[3:13:37.560 --> 3:13:43.560]  And then, when you don't give them the handouts, tell them you might just have to go back home,
[3:13:43.560 --> 3:13:48.560]  they get violent. They get angry. They storm an airport.
[3:13:48.560 --> 3:13:51.560]  And what is the humor in that they are allowed to stream that?
[3:13:51.560 --> 3:13:54.560]  That is something special in and of itself.
[3:13:54.560 --> 3:13:59.560]  Now, this does harken back. The American media, the globalist media in general.
[3:13:59.560 --> 3:14:02.560]  Fox News, I heard Owen talking about Fox News just before I came on.
[3:14:02.560 --> 3:14:05.560]  They're not doing any favors to France or Europe.
[3:14:05.560 --> 3:14:11.560]  When the Notre Dame Cathedral was still burning, they ended interviews prematurely
[3:14:11.560 --> 3:14:15.560]  with two different Fox guests who brought up the pattern of church fires in France.
[3:14:15.560 --> 3:14:20.560]  France had, in the month of March, I think 10 or 15 churches, Catholic churches,
[3:14:20.560 --> 3:14:28.560]  attacked in various ways. In some instances, they smeared excrement onto crosses
[3:14:28.560 --> 3:14:33.560]  and put communion wafers on them. Stunning and brave, absolutely stunning and brave.
[3:14:33.560 --> 3:14:37.560]  And you notice the American media has not been really covering this.
[3:14:37.560 --> 3:14:41.560]  And especially if the name comes out and it turns out to be one of these poor, peaceful migrants,
[3:14:41.560 --> 3:14:45.560]  I think that we will never hear anything from it. And the likes of Shep Smith,
[3:14:45.560 --> 3:14:50.560]  who is an alleged sexual predator, he allegedly got a man drunk, took him to his apartment
[3:14:50.560 --> 3:14:56.560]  and attempted to kiss him and maybe grope him. Disgusting people, if true.
[3:14:56.560 --> 3:14:59.560]  He has no interest, no interest. He's going to parrot.
[3:14:59.560 --> 3:15:02.560]  He's going to parrot whatever the left wing says.
[3:15:02.560 --> 3:15:05.560]  There was also a jihadi who planned a bombing of the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris.
[3:15:05.560 --> 3:15:08.560]  He got eight years in prison. Thankfully, that wasn't successful.
[3:15:08.560 --> 3:15:12.560]  And a freak electrical incident did his job for him anyway.
[3:15:12.560 --> 3:15:18.560]  It is absolutely fascinating. And of course, as I mentioned, France has been absolutely shook
[3:15:18.560 --> 3:15:24.560]  by the yellow vest protests who are tired of socialism, tired of migrants getting a free pass.
[3:15:24.560 --> 3:15:28.560]  And it really is from all walks of life, people coming forward to say that this globalist system
[3:15:28.560 --> 3:15:33.560]  does not work for the people. So as we learn more about this attack, we'll be sure to update you.
[3:15:33.560 --> 3:15:39.560]  This is the Alex Jones Show. I'm Tom Pappard. Facebook's got him for Trump filling in for the fourth hour.
[3:15:39.560 --> 3:15:42.560]  And thank you to Alex and thank you to the crew for making that possible.
[3:15:42.560 --> 3:15:45.560]  We're going to be right back after this next commercial break.
[3:15:45.560 --> 3:16:14.560]  Again, this is the Alex Jones Show. I am Tom Pappard. We'll see you in a minute.
[3:16:15.560 --> 3:16:22.560]  We'll see you in a minute.
[3:16:46.560 --> 3:16:49.560]  And truly modern twist on this primitive survival tool.

[3:17:20.560 --> 3:17:27.560]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[3:17:27.560 --> 3:17:32.560]  I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[3:17:32.560 --> 3:17:37.560]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[3:17:37.560 --> 3:17:44.560]  I can help you too. If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day. There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[3:17:44.560 --> 3:17:53.560]  Call 800-34-no-tax or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[3:17:53.560 --> 3:17:57.560]  Infowars life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[3:17:57.560 --> 3:18:04.560]  Introducing pollen block. We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[3:18:04.560 --> 3:18:11.560]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[3:18:11.560 --> 3:18:20.560]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[3:18:20.560 --> 3:18:26.560]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research,
[3:18:26.560 --> 3:18:31.560]  a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[3:18:31.560 --> 3:18:35.560]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine.
[3:18:35.560 --> 3:18:41.560]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase,
[3:18:41.560 --> 3:18:45.560]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[3:18:45.560 --> 3:18:48.560]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[3:18:48.560 --> 3:18:53.560]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.

[3:19:44.560 --> 3:19:56.560]  Head to infowarsstore.com today.
[3:19:56.560 --> 3:20:19.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:20:19.560 --> 3:20:26.560]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm Tom Papert, guest hosting for this Fourth Hour. We're going to change gears just slightly.
[3:20:26.560 --> 3:20:33.560]  We're going to talk tech censorship because there is a development today that I did not honestly expect.
[3:20:33.560 --> 3:20:38.560]  I cover this stuff nonstop. My Facebook page, God Emperor Trump, has been banned six different times.
[3:20:38.560 --> 3:20:45.560]  And like a phoenix, we rise from the dead largely with the help of our friends over at Infowars. Fantastic people.
[3:20:45.560 --> 3:20:53.560]  But today, a company, a fitness company announced their decision to boycott Facebook and Instagram.
[3:20:53.560 --> 3:20:59.560]  They're done with the platforms and the reasons why it sounds like they've been watching the Alex Jones Show.
[3:20:59.560 --> 3:21:03.560]  We're going to break some of that down, but it's CrossFit. Who the heck saw this one coming?
[3:21:03.560 --> 3:21:10.560]  CrossFit, boycotts Facebook after 1.65 million strong Facebook group is banned.
[3:21:10.560 --> 3:21:16.560]  Who would have thought it would be CrossFit of all people that actually takes the stand against Facebook?
[3:21:16.560 --> 3:21:23.560]  I had no idea this was coming. Who would have thought that this would be the one that actually would step away from these big tech platforms
[3:21:23.560 --> 3:21:28.560]  and call them out for what they are? A globalist spy network. It's truly astounding.
[3:21:28.560 --> 3:21:40.560]  After the Banting Seven Day Meal Plan Facebook group was banned without an explanation, CrossFit announced its decision to end all use of both Facebook and Instagram.
[3:21:40.560 --> 3:21:49.560]  According to CrossFit, the group was used by 1.65 million users to share advice, testimonials, and to provide encouragement to users pursuing the CrossFit health plan.
[3:21:49.560 --> 3:21:54.560]  Something Jerry Nadler might want to check out. I think they could help him, the poor guy. I hope he's okay.
[3:21:54.560 --> 3:22:00.560]  So let's just cross over to their website because their reasons for doing this are absolutely stunning.
[3:22:00.560 --> 3:22:07.560]  They said Facebook deleted without warning or explanation our group. The group had 1.65 million users who post testimonials and other information.
[3:22:07.560 --> 3:22:16.560]  While the site has subsequently reinstated also without warning or explanation, Facebook's actions should give any serious person reason to pause,
[3:22:16.560 --> 3:22:22.560]  especially those of us engaged with activities contrary to the prevailing opinion.
[3:22:22.560 --> 3:22:28.560]  Facebook and its properties host and oversee a significant share of the marketplace of public thought.
[3:22:28.560 --> 3:22:34.560]  In other words, this is me saying this, Tom Pappard, they are the modern public square.
[3:22:34.560 --> 3:22:39.560]  And if you do not agree with what they believe, then you are not welcome in the public square. That is a direct violation of the First Amendment.
[3:22:39.560 --> 3:22:46.560]  But of course, their lawyers and Mark Zuckerberg and his booster seat, they do a very good job of dancing playfully around that.
[3:22:46.560 --> 3:22:52.560]  They refuse to call themselves the public square. They also refuse to call themselves a publisher.
[3:22:52.560 --> 3:22:56.560]  They are walking a very thin line to avoid lawsuit after lawsuit.
[3:22:56.560 --> 3:22:58.560]  But let's continue reading from CrossFit.
[3:22:58.560 --> 3:23:05.560]  To millions of individuals and communities across the world, Facebook and its properties remain the platforms where ideas and information are exchanged.
[3:23:05.560 --> 3:23:12.560]  Facebook thus serves as the de facto authority over the public square, arbitrating a worldwide exchange of information,
[3:23:12.560 --> 3:23:19.560]  as well as overseeing the security of the individuals and communities who entrust their ideas, work and private data to this platform.
[3:23:19.560 --> 3:23:27.560]  This mandates a certain responsibility and assurance of good faith, transparency and due process, which they obviously do not have.
[3:23:27.560 --> 3:23:30.560]  But then CrossFit does something absolutely fascinating.
[3:23:30.560 --> 3:23:36.560]  And I swear, you read this and it's like you're watching the Alex Jones show. It's like you're reading infowars.com.
[3:23:36.560 --> 3:23:44.560]  You are hearing from normal people totally uninvolved with politics at this point, exactly what's going on.
[3:23:44.560 --> 3:23:49.560]  And I want to turn to point number one to honestly all of them.
[3:23:49.560 --> 3:23:52.560]  They put up a bullet point, eight bullet points of what they believe Facebook is doing.
[3:23:52.560 --> 3:23:59.560]  Facebook collects and aggregates user information and shares it with state and federal authorities, as well as security organizations from other countries.
[3:23:59.560 --> 3:24:00.560]  We know this.
[3:24:00.560 --> 3:24:11.560]  Two, Facebook collaborates with government security agencies on massive surveillance programs such as Prism.
[3:24:11.560 --> 3:24:17.560]  Did you ever think you would hear a massive truth bomb like this coming from an exercise website?
[3:24:17.560 --> 3:24:26.560]  Facebook censors and removes user accounts based on unknown criteria and at the request of third parties, including government and foreign government agencies.
[3:24:26.560 --> 3:24:31.560]  Remember, the reason why Alex Jones personal Facebook accounts is gone.
[3:24:31.560 --> 3:24:35.560]  The reason why you're not allowed to post a link to infowars.com on Facebook.
[3:24:35.560 --> 3:24:41.560]  The reason why you're not allowed to post a meme video featuring Alex Jones is because Alex Jones is a hate figure and they determined this.
[3:24:41.560 --> 3:24:43.560]  So it must be true.
[3:24:43.560 --> 3:24:45.560]  Facebook is judge, jury and executioner.
[3:24:45.560 --> 3:24:47.560]  They don't have any laws that govern them.
[3:24:47.560 --> 3:24:49.560]  That's the way it works.
[3:24:49.560 --> 3:24:52.560]  So, and by the way, this whole bit about it's unknown.
[3:24:52.560 --> 3:24:55.560]  Facebook really gets mad when you talk about that.
[3:24:55.560 --> 3:24:57.560]  I've emailed with top Facebook people.
[3:24:57.560 --> 3:25:04.560]  In fact, I was the first one who really got them to admit straight up what they were doing that you can no longer post links to Alex Jones.
[3:25:04.560 --> 3:25:11.560]  You can say, I think Alex Jones is a wonderful person, but you can't say that very statement and then have a link to an info wars video below it.
[3:25:11.560 --> 3:25:13.560]  That gets you banned.
[3:25:13.560 --> 3:25:17.560]  Total, total absolute insanity.
[3:25:17.560 --> 3:25:24.560]  But they maintain that all of this is publicly available on their public facing community standards section of the website.
[3:25:24.560 --> 3:25:26.560]  And it's not.
[3:25:26.560 --> 3:25:31.560]  Now that what they need to do if they're going to seriously go down this rabbit hole is put up a list.
[3:25:31.560 --> 3:25:32.560]  These are all the hate figures.
[3:25:32.560 --> 3:25:34.560]  You're not allowed to post links to these people's videos.
[3:25:34.560 --> 3:25:36.560]  You're not allowed to say anything to complimentary of them.
[3:25:36.560 --> 3:25:41.560]  And if you post a photo, well, we might remove that too as Instagram has done in several different instances.
[3:25:41.560 --> 3:25:44.560]  And I believe Facebook as well, but they don't have anything like that.
[3:25:44.560 --> 3:25:49.560]  In fact, they only discuss hate figures in the context of terrorism.
[3:25:49.560 --> 3:25:51.560]  So Alex Jones is essentially a terrorist.
[3:25:51.560 --> 3:25:55.560]  Paul Joseph Watson, the mild mannered Brit summit dot news is his new website.
[3:25:55.560 --> 3:25:59.560]  Well, he's essentially a terrorist.
[3:25:59.560 --> 3:26:00.560]  He's Osama bin Laden.
[3:26:00.560 --> 3:26:03.560]  Alex Jones is Osama bin Laden, according to Facebook.
[3:26:03.560 --> 3:26:05.560]  So let's keep reading this list.
[3:26:05.560 --> 3:26:06.560]  It's absolutely fascinating.
[3:26:06.560 --> 3:26:10.560]  Facebook collects aggregates and sells user information as a matter of business.
[3:26:10.560 --> 3:26:20.560]  Its business model allows governments and businesses alike to use its algorithmically configured advertising categories as sophisticated data mining and surveillance tools.
[3:26:20.560 --> 3:26:21.560]  Facebook is spying on you.
[3:26:21.560 --> 3:26:22.560]  Facebook is selling you.
[3:26:22.560 --> 3:26:23.560]  You are the product.
[3:26:23.560 --> 3:26:27.560]  And of course, there are all the conspiracies and I have no doubt in my mind that it's true.
[3:26:27.560 --> 3:26:31.560]  Facebook listens to you on these little rectangles we have and on your Amazon Echo.
[3:26:31.560 --> 3:26:33.560]  It needs your mic for a reason.
[3:26:33.560 --> 3:26:35.560]  It's not just for Siri.
[3:26:35.560 --> 3:26:37.560]  Facebook's news feeds.
[3:26:37.560 --> 3:26:49.560]  Get a load of this are censored and crafted to reflect the political leanings of Facebook's utopian socialists while remaining vulnerable to misinformation campaigns designed to stir up violence.
[3:26:49.560 --> 3:26:51.560]  And prejudice.
[3:26:51.560 --> 3:27:06.560]  I just have to stress, folks, this is an exercise website calling out Facebook for being a bunch of utopian socialists who are censoring and crafting their news feed to be all the information they want.
[3:27:06.560 --> 3:27:08.560]  And I get pinged about this all the time.
[3:27:08.560 --> 3:27:16.560]  We have an official group on Facebook where if one user posts fake news and it can be something that's completely accurate, but Facebook thinks it's fake.
[3:27:16.560 --> 3:27:19.560]  Very rare is an actual fake news.
[3:27:19.560 --> 3:27:24.560]  But they will threaten you with, well, we're not going to put your group in the news feed anymore.
[3:27:24.560 --> 3:27:27.560]  We're going to put you at the very bottom of the page so nobody sees you.
[3:27:27.560 --> 3:27:29.560]  We're not going to tell people to join your group anymore.
[3:27:29.560 --> 3:27:30.560]  You're going to be shadow banned.
[3:27:30.560 --> 3:27:35.560]  They're essentially, without using the words, admitting, yes, we're going to shadow ban you.
[3:27:35.560 --> 3:27:37.560]  So you have Facebook admitting this.
[3:27:37.560 --> 3:27:38.560]  Absolutely admitting this.
[3:27:38.560 --> 3:27:45.560]  Facebook, as a matter of business and principle, has weak intellectual property protections and has slowed to close down IP theft accounts.
[3:27:45.560 --> 3:27:47.560]  Facebook has poor security protocols.
[3:27:47.560 --> 3:27:55.560]  And Facebook is acting in the service and food beverage industry interests by banning people like CrossFit.
[3:27:55.560 --> 3:28:03.560]  So this is a brave stand taken by a massive, massive organization that I think is going to rock Facebook.
[3:28:03.560 --> 3:28:08.560]  I think that this is going to raise some heads in the business world, especially in the health and fitness world.
[3:28:08.560 --> 3:28:15.560]  I think even though my revenue, my business depends directly on Facebook, it's the right move.
[3:28:15.560 --> 3:28:16.560]  It's the right move.
[3:28:16.560 --> 3:28:20.560]  If I didn't have to be on Facebook, if I had been as smart as Alex Jones, I might not be there anymore.
[3:28:20.560 --> 3:28:21.560]  I'm Tom Pappert.
[3:28:21.560 --> 3:28:23.560]  This is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show.
[3:28:23.560 --> 3:28:26.560]  We're going to be back in just a couple of minutes after a short break.
[3:28:26.560 --> 3:28:30.560]  Just to give you an idea of where we're going after this, we've got some more Facebook.
[3:28:30.560 --> 3:28:35.560]  Rufio Panman, the Antifa Smashing, Proud Boy Affiliated Individual.
[3:28:35.560 --> 3:28:37.560]  His podcast has been banned from Facebook.
[3:28:37.560 --> 3:28:41.560]  We're going to talk and get into great detail about what happened to the Krasenstein brothers.
[3:28:41.560 --> 3:28:44.560]  We're going to talk about how the media gets a pass.
[3:28:44.560 --> 3:28:46.560]  They do exactly what Alex Jones is accused of doing.
[3:28:46.560 --> 3:28:47.560]  Don't get any blame.
[3:28:47.560 --> 3:28:48.560]  We'll be right back.
[3:28:48.560 --> 3:28:50.560]  This is the Alex Jones show.
[3:28:50.560 --> 3:28:51.560]  See you after the break.
[3:28:52.560 --> 3:28:55.560]  Okay, so a watch is good and some jewelry.
[3:28:55.560 --> 3:28:56.560]  Better grab some flowers too.
[3:28:56.560 --> 3:28:57.560]  Hey, what you doing?
[3:28:57.560 --> 3:28:58.560]  Mother's Day, remember?
[3:28:58.560 --> 3:28:59.560]  Oh, yeah.
[3:28:59.560 --> 3:29:03.560]  So I'm making lists, got to plan a trip to the store, then need to save all the receipts in case she wants to return.
[3:29:03.560 --> 3:29:05.560]  You know there's an easier way, right?
[3:29:05.560 --> 3:29:06.560]  I'm guessing you do.

[3:32:24.560 --> 3:32:49.560]  Anybody can use it. Reupload and do whatever you want. People go to infowars.com and newswars.com. That's where they find it.
[3:32:49.560 --> 3:33:00.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:33:19.560 --> 3:33:24.560]  Welcome back to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show. I'm Tom Papert, guest hosting this hour.
[3:33:24.560 --> 3:33:28.560]  Facebook's gone in for Trump at the tail end of the last segment.
[3:33:28.560 --> 3:33:35.560]  I mentioned that, you know, I am largely dependent on Facebook and social media, something that Matt Drudge has warned against heavily.
[3:33:35.560 --> 3:33:45.560]  And Alex Jones, he had the means and the capability and the intelligence to take that warning from Matt Drudge a few years ago here on the broadcast.
[3:33:45.560 --> 3:33:52.560]  And he created, well, he already had it, but he doubled down on his own website, infowars.com.
[3:33:52.560 --> 3:33:57.560]  And you can watch all the videos at infowars.com slash show. There's still an app for Android.
[3:33:57.560 --> 3:34:03.560]  If you're lucky and you got it before Apple took it out of the app store, it's on some Apple devices, some.
[3:34:03.560 --> 3:34:07.560]  I've still got it. Lucky, lucky me. Never going to get rid of this phone. It's a collector's item now.
[3:34:07.560 --> 3:34:16.560]  But in order to do this, I can speak from experience. I work in television, KCTV5 is the affiliate I'm affiliated with.
[3:34:16.560 --> 3:34:24.560]  And it takes so much financial giving to make this work, to have your own hosting.
[3:34:24.560 --> 3:34:31.560]  YouTube has never turned a profit. YouTube is a lost leader for Google. It doesn't make money. It does not make money.
[3:34:31.560 --> 3:34:36.560]  And that's because of the video host. That's because it costs a fortune.
[3:34:36.560 --> 3:34:43.560]  So now more than ever, Alex Jones, infowars, everybody on this fantastic platform, the crew, they need your support.
[3:34:43.560 --> 3:34:49.560]  And there are some tremendous Memorial Day sales going on right now. I was just looking them over during the commercial break.
[3:34:49.560 --> 3:34:55.560]  They've got 60% off, extend twice, 60% off, Myco ZX Plus.
[3:34:55.560 --> 3:35:03.560]  They've got an all new eight pack power stack, 50% off, SuperMail Vitality, which is probably my favorite product is 50% off.
[3:35:03.560 --> 3:35:07.560]  Ultimate bone broth bodies, vitamin, mineral fusion, all 50% off.
[3:35:07.560 --> 3:35:14.560]  Turbo force, which I think it's almost, I don't know, it's either as good or maybe a little bit better than brain force.
[3:35:14.560 --> 3:35:18.560]  But I do love brain force. I would not have graduated college without brain force. I stand by that statement.
[3:35:18.560 --> 3:35:22.560]  But it's 50% off. Bodies is 50, I'm sorry, 40% off.
[3:35:22.560 --> 3:35:26.560]  And the chocolate, peanut butter and vanilla, coconut, protein bars are 40% off.
[3:35:26.560 --> 3:35:33.560]  I'd love to try those. Super silver wound gel is 40% off. And you can get $50 off an Alexa pure breeze.
[3:35:33.560 --> 3:35:38.560]  Let me tell you folks, I live in a dusty old building. There may or may not be some asbestos.
[3:35:38.560 --> 3:35:41.560]  They didn't rip up the floor, so they don't know. Very old building.
[3:35:41.560 --> 3:35:49.560]  I am a terrible, terribly allergic to everything that grows in God's green earth and without an Alexa pure breeze.
[3:35:49.560 --> 3:35:52.560]  I don't know if I'd be able to do this show right now.
[3:35:52.560 --> 3:35:56.560]  I'd be blowing my nose in every commercial break and the crew can back me up.
[3:35:56.560 --> 3:35:58.560]  Haven't had to do it once. Haven't had to do it once.
[3:35:58.560 --> 3:36:02.560]  So take advantage of these tremendous sales this Memorial Day.
[3:36:02.560 --> 3:36:08.560]  Celebrate Memorial Day by helping lead the fight. Infowars is the tip of the spear.
[3:36:08.560 --> 3:36:12.560]  And with great deals like these, it makes it easy, easy, easy to do so.
[3:36:12.560 --> 3:36:16.560]  And when you do that, you keep Alex Jones going. You keep Infowars going.
[3:36:16.560 --> 3:36:20.560]  You keep Owen Schreuer, who's going to be hosting the war room coming up in the next hour.
[3:36:20.560 --> 3:36:26.560]  You keep him going. You keep David Knight going. You keep the crew well fed and happy.
[3:36:26.560 --> 3:36:33.560]  And it's a whole lot better, I speak from experience, to know that you are helping the people who help this country.
[3:36:33.560 --> 3:36:41.560]  Then when you go to Whole Foods or you go to Costco or you go to the local GNC or whatever your supplement store is and stock up there.
[3:36:41.560 --> 3:36:48.560]  I know that sometimes I cheat and I'll get the Alexa pure breeze filters from Amazon.
[3:36:48.560 --> 3:36:52.560]  And when I do it, you just feel dirty. You don't save hardly any money.
[3:36:52.560 --> 3:36:56.560]  You get maybe a little bit faster shipping if you're lucky and the UPS knows where you live.
[3:36:56.560 --> 3:37:02.560]  Maybe a little bit faster shipping costs the same amount of money and I'm giving my money to Jeff Bezos.
[3:37:02.560 --> 3:37:06.560]  Why would you want to give your money to the guy who owns the Washington compost?
[3:37:06.560 --> 3:37:10.560]  It totally baffles me. And so I try not to do it. Maybe once or twice I have.
[3:37:10.560 --> 3:37:16.560]  But we're going to talk Facebook censorship and social media censorship and tech censorship.
[3:37:16.560 --> 3:37:20.560]  Really, Alex Jones is a genius. He's like President Trump.
[3:37:20.560 --> 3:37:25.560]  He is a very stable genius to have his own platform where nobody can shut him down.
[3:37:25.560 --> 3:37:28.560]  The only way they can shut him down is by driving him out of business.
[3:37:28.560 --> 3:37:32.560]  And they're trying. I have no doubt in my mind. They want us all out of business.
[3:37:32.560 --> 3:37:36.560]  They want us all dead if they could get it, but they'll settle for bankrupt.
[3:37:36.560 --> 3:37:40.560]  So as I said, it's very important to go to infowarstore.com, take advantage of the Memorial Day sale.
[3:37:40.560 --> 3:37:48.560]  But let's talk about the people who didn't have the ability, the intelligence, the financial backing that Alex Jones does.
[3:37:48.560 --> 3:37:53.560]  Let's talk about the Titans of Liberty with Rufio Panman and Jason Low.
[3:37:53.560 --> 3:37:56.560]  I know you've probably heard about him if you've been watching The War Room.
[3:37:56.560 --> 3:37:59.560]  But they've now been taken off of Facebook.
[3:37:59.560 --> 3:38:05.560]  I hesitate to even call it a ban because it wasn't a ban as much as it was an outright purge.
[3:38:05.560 --> 3:38:10.560]  So they host this conservative podcast. Rufio Panman is the guy. You can't really do it just as in a suit,
[3:38:10.560 --> 3:38:14.560]  but he decked that Antifa loser allegedly.
[3:38:14.560 --> 3:38:19.560]  And the glasses, they say, are still in orbit. His sunglasses went flying off his face.
[3:38:19.560 --> 3:38:22.560]  And they say that it is in a low earth orbit after Rufio Panman.
[3:38:22.560 --> 3:38:28.560]  So what Facebook did is something fairly unique. It happened to me once.
[3:38:28.560 --> 3:38:32.560]  And again, thanks to my friends at InfoWars, I still have a Facebook page, God Emperor Trump.
[3:38:32.560 --> 3:38:36.560]  But instead of, okay, you're going to get hit with a 30-day ban
[3:38:36.560 --> 3:38:41.560]  because you said something bad that we disagree with, you put a little wrong thing out there.
[3:38:41.560 --> 3:38:46.560]  Instead of doing that, just poof, totally gone, gone from the platform.
[3:38:46.560 --> 3:38:50.560]  Nobody was punished. The users, the admins, they didn't get a ban.
[3:38:50.560 --> 3:38:53.560]  Nobody explained what they did wrong.
[3:38:53.560 --> 3:38:59.560]  Instead, the page just no longer exists. It's been shoved down the memory hole.
[3:38:59.560 --> 3:39:04.560]  And this is the type of thing that we have to hold these people accountable.
[3:39:04.560 --> 3:39:08.560]  And so I'm glad that I could get in touch with Mr. Lowe, the co-host of the podcast.
[3:39:08.560 --> 3:39:12.560]  I'm happy I could get in touch with him and discuss this, but this is absolutely baffling.
[3:39:12.560 --> 3:39:16.560]  He said to us, the page disappeared out of thin air and it's just gone.
[3:39:16.560 --> 3:39:21.560]  No warning, no nothing, no reason at all.
[3:39:21.560 --> 3:39:30.560]  And I hope that these individuals have used President Trump's new tech censorship reporting tool.
[3:39:30.560 --> 3:39:34.560]  And I hope that everybody out there is, because this is just one story
[3:39:34.560 --> 3:39:37.560]  out of probably tens or even hundreds of thousands at this point.
[3:39:37.560 --> 3:39:39.560]  And it happens every day.
[3:39:39.560 --> 3:39:44.560]  And this is another just call and begging to my fellow people on social media.
[3:39:44.560 --> 3:39:47.560]  If this happens to you, tell everybody.
[3:39:47.560 --> 3:39:52.560]  Don't just shrug and say, well, guess I'm not allowed on Facebook anymore.
[3:39:52.560 --> 3:39:55.560]  Be as Alex Jonesian as you can.
[3:39:55.560 --> 3:39:58.560]  Not everybody can go to the White House with a bullhorn
[3:39:58.560 --> 3:40:03.560]  and shout directly at the president as he meets with Twitter Jack.
[3:40:03.560 --> 3:40:05.560]  Not everybody has that capability.
[3:40:05.560 --> 3:40:07.560]  Not everybody has the guts to do what Alex Jones does.
[3:40:07.560 --> 3:40:09.560]  And that's perfectly fine.
[3:40:09.560 --> 3:40:12.560]  But we in the conservative media, we want to tell your story.
[3:40:12.560 --> 3:40:15.560]  We want to put a magnifying glass on this.
[3:40:15.560 --> 3:40:18.560]  And the president now wants to hear it as well.
[3:40:18.560 --> 3:40:22.560]  Because this is the crisis of our time.
[3:40:22.560 --> 3:40:27.560]  The First Amendment, when you put Mark Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey
[3:40:27.560 --> 3:40:30.560]  and the Vajaya woman, whatever her name is over at Twitter,
[3:40:30.560 --> 3:40:35.560]  when you put them in the judge, jury and executioner seats,
[3:40:35.560 --> 3:40:37.560]  there is no justice.
[3:40:37.560 --> 3:40:39.560]  There is no process.
[3:40:39.560 --> 3:40:42.560]  There is literally no process for the Titans of Liberty podcast run by Pan Man and Low.
[3:40:42.560 --> 3:40:45.560]  There is no process whatsoever.
[3:40:45.560 --> 3:40:48.560]  Just one day they wake up and the Facebook page is gone.
[3:40:48.560 --> 3:40:53.560]  Kind of like one day Facebook decides Alex Jones is a hate figure.
[3:40:53.560 --> 3:40:55.560]  And Alex Jones is gone.
[3:40:55.560 --> 3:40:57.560]  One day I wake up.
[3:40:57.560 --> 3:41:02.560]  I swear that if I were a lefty, if I were one of these triggered blue-haired and sane people,
[3:41:02.560 --> 3:41:04.560]  I would be screaming that I have PTSD.
[3:41:04.560 --> 3:41:08.560]  Because rarely does a day go by where I don't wake up at 4 o'clock in the morning out of breath.
[3:41:08.560 --> 3:41:10.560]  And the first thing I do is, where's my phone?
[3:41:10.560 --> 3:41:11.560]  Where's my phone? Do I have a Facebook page?
[3:41:11.560 --> 3:41:14.560]  And Paul Joseph Watson says he does the same exact thing.
[3:41:14.560 --> 3:41:16.560]  He wakes up every morning and the first thing he does,
[3:41:16.560 --> 3:41:19.560]  before he comes his hair, before he talks to his family,
[3:41:19.560 --> 3:41:22.560]  before he returns and he calls or checks his emails,
[3:41:22.560 --> 3:41:24.560]  is the YouTube page still there.
[3:41:24.560 --> 3:41:25.560]  Do I still have a YouTube channel?
[3:41:25.560 --> 3:41:27.560]  Okay, we've got a YouTube channel still in business.
[3:41:27.560 --> 3:41:29.560]  And this is a terrible, terrible paradigm.
[3:41:29.560 --> 3:41:32.560]  And I'm very encouraged that President Trump is acting.
[3:41:32.560 --> 3:41:36.560]  And I do wonder, and we're going to be getting into this more in the next segment,
[3:41:36.560 --> 3:41:42.560]  but I do wonder if the Krasenstein brothers, are they a sacrificial lamb?
[3:41:42.560 --> 3:41:45.560]  Are they Twitter flexing its power?
[3:41:45.560 --> 3:41:48.560]  Are they seeing what they can get away with?
[3:41:48.560 --> 3:41:51.560]  Or did these guys actually break the rules?
[3:41:51.560 --> 3:41:52.560]  I don't know.
[3:41:52.560 --> 3:41:53.560]  I don't know.
[3:41:53.560 --> 3:41:56.560]  I'm going to share some of my theories and we're going to give you the facts that we know,
[3:41:56.560 --> 3:41:58.560]  because Twitter has banned the Krasenstein brothers.
[3:41:58.560 --> 3:42:02.560]  And for those who don't know, they're these two little trolls who are their brothers
[3:42:02.560 --> 3:42:06.560]  and they are in every single one of President Trump's tweets.
[3:42:06.560 --> 3:42:10.560]  It's their full nine to five job.
[3:42:10.560 --> 3:42:14.560]  They respond to President Trump's tweets to say something derogatory whenever possible.
[3:42:14.560 --> 3:42:16.560]  And now they've been banned.
[3:42:16.560 --> 3:42:18.560]  Allegedly, they've bought fake engagement.
[3:42:18.560 --> 3:42:22.560]  And they might have fake people following their now defunct accounts.
[3:42:22.560 --> 3:42:28.560]  And so on one hand, if they broke this rule, well, you know, that's a real rule.
[3:42:28.560 --> 3:42:31.560]  They didn't just get named a hate figure and shoved down the memory hole.
[3:42:31.560 --> 3:42:38.560]  But on the other hand, the First Amendment and freedom of speech should be for everyone.
[3:42:38.560 --> 3:42:42.560]  Even these two strange looking little losers.
[3:42:42.560 --> 3:42:43.560]  So I'm Tom Papert.
[3:42:43.560 --> 3:42:45.560]  This is the Alex Jones show.
[3:42:45.560 --> 3:42:46.560]  We're in the fourth hour.
[3:42:46.560 --> 3:42:47.560]  I'm going to be right back.
[3:42:47.560 --> 3:42:52.560]  We're going to talk more tech censorship and some other news of the day.
[3:42:52.560 --> 3:42:58.560]  You know, the worst part about getting old and I'm still strong at 45 is that I won't be there for my children someday.
[3:42:58.560 --> 3:42:59.560]  That's why I need to make them strong now.
[3:42:59.560 --> 3:43:01.560]  Now I can be there for my children.
[3:43:01.560 --> 3:43:03.560]  Now I can make them strong.
[3:43:03.560 --> 3:43:04.560]  Now I can instruct them.
[3:43:04.560 --> 3:43:06.560]  Now I can teach them what I've learned.
[3:43:06.560 --> 3:43:07.560]  But not once I'm gone.
[3:43:07.560 --> 3:43:10.560]  You think of this digital age, your words gone forever, but now they're even better.
[3:43:10.560 --> 3:43:12.560]  Getting rid of what you said they were before.
[3:43:12.560 --> 3:43:18.560]  It's so much easier to burn video or text or languages now that we have high tech book burning, isn't it?
[3:43:18.560 --> 3:43:21.560]  But I have joined my will to the resistance.
[3:43:21.560 --> 3:43:23.560]  I can't be destroyed now.
[3:43:23.560 --> 3:43:28.560]  As long as I realize I've done right and as long as the people know the truth and you can't be destroyed either.
[3:43:28.560 --> 3:43:33.560]  As long as you bind yourself to something and commit to it and go through the fire for it,
[3:43:33.560 --> 3:43:37.560]  there is a magic that then takes place, the transcend space and time.
[3:43:37.560 --> 3:43:42.560]  When you commit, be a word of mouth or to pray for us or to spread our articles and videos.
[3:43:42.560 --> 3:43:45.560]  That overrides everything the enemy's doing.
[3:43:45.560 --> 3:43:52.560]  So please now commit to support InfoWars however you can and realize your provision to InfoWars is your own provision.
[3:43:52.560 --> 3:43:58.560]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[3:43:58.560 --> 3:44:01.560]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients and stress,
[3:44:01.560 --> 3:44:07.560]  you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins and minerals needed daily.
[3:44:07.560 --> 3:44:12.560]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful vitamin mineral fusion formula.

[3:44:53.560 --> 3:44:56.560]  Everybody knows that supplements are amazing.
[3:44:56.560 --> 3:44:59.560]  That what God gave us for Mother Nature is incredible.
[3:44:59.560 --> 3:45:03.560]  That's why supplements are the biggest growing industry in the world and the globalists are so upset.
[3:45:03.560 --> 3:45:07.560]  The problem is people forget to take them.
[3:45:07.560 --> 3:45:13.560]  And that's why the whole industry has moved towards packets that you take in the morning and you take at night.
[3:45:13.560 --> 3:45:17.560]  So we looked at that, we made the very best AM and PM packets out there
[3:45:17.560 --> 3:45:22.560]  with an incredible spectrum of 13 different capsules that you take in two servings a day

[3:45:47.560 --> 3:45:53.560]  We looked at the best selling products out there and we made it even better and we lowered the price.
[3:45:55.560 --> 3:45:56.560]  Okay, it's true.
[3:45:56.560 --> 3:46:00.560]  I stayed up late last night so I had half the turbo force this morning.
[3:46:00.560 --> 3:46:11.560]  The Vitabits, the medicals, the amino acids.
[3:46:11.560 --> 3:46:12.560]  That's turbo force.
[3:46:12.560 --> 3:46:26.560]  5 different types of caffeine, plus a natural crush.
[3:46:26.560 --> 3:46:29.560]  5 different types of caffeine, plus a natural crush.
[3:46:29.560 --> 3:46:50.560]  3 different types of almonds.
[3:46:50.560 --> 3:46:56.560]  And get official.
[3:46:56.560 --> 3:47:00.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:47:18.560 --> 3:47:20.560]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:47:20.560 --> 3:47:21.560]  This is the Fourth Hour.
[3:47:21.560 --> 3:47:23.560]  I'm your guest host, Tom Pappard,
[3:47:23.560 --> 3:47:25.560]  Facebook's God Emperor Trump.
[3:47:25.560 --> 3:47:27.560]  And we've been talking tech censorship.
[3:47:27.560 --> 3:47:29.560]  I want to do a little bit more of that.
[3:47:29.560 --> 3:47:30.560]  We'll talk about the media,
[3:47:30.560 --> 3:47:32.560]  a well-known leftist media outlet
[3:47:32.560 --> 3:47:34.560]  allegedly doing exactly
[3:47:34.560 --> 3:47:36.560]  what everyone says they banned Alex Jones for.
[3:47:36.560 --> 3:47:38.560]  And then I want to talk a little bit about
[3:47:38.560 --> 3:47:40.560]  what's going on with the left.
[3:47:40.560 --> 3:47:42.560]  These poor, sick, sick people.
[3:47:42.560 --> 3:47:44.560]  And I don't mean even necessarily mentally sick.
[3:47:44.560 --> 3:47:46.560]  I mean, physically ill.
[3:47:46.560 --> 3:47:48.560]  My heart would go out to them
[3:47:48.560 --> 3:47:50.560]  if they weren't so dang evil.
[3:47:50.560 --> 3:47:53.560]  So Twitter has banned the Krasenstein Brothers.
[3:47:53.560 --> 3:47:56.560]  The two twins, the Twitter trolls
[3:47:56.560 --> 3:47:58.560]  who haunt President Trump's Twitter,
[3:47:58.560 --> 3:48:00.560]  saying anything they can to make him look bad.
[3:48:00.560 --> 3:48:04.560]  Impleach, Blumpf, seems to be their rallying cry.
[3:48:04.560 --> 3:48:06.560]  They were banned yesterday evening.
[3:48:06.560 --> 3:48:08.560]  The accounts of the well-known Twitter trolls
[3:48:08.560 --> 3:48:11.560]  Ed and Brian Krasenstein were both suspended.
[3:48:11.560 --> 3:48:13.560]  The two became famous and infamous
[3:48:13.560 --> 3:48:16.560]  for their constant replies to President Donald Trump's Twitter feed,
[3:48:16.560 --> 3:48:18.560]  usually with calls for his impeachment.
[3:48:18.560 --> 3:48:19.560]  And between the two,
[3:48:19.560 --> 3:48:21.560]  they had nearly 2 million Twitter followers
[3:48:21.560 --> 3:48:25.560]  and were often the top response to Trump's tweets.
[3:48:25.560 --> 3:48:26.560]  And now with their suspensions,
[3:48:26.560 --> 3:48:29.560]  we may know why they were always those top response.
[3:48:29.560 --> 3:48:32.560]  People would be baffled and scrunching their heads
[3:48:32.560 --> 3:48:34.560]  and how come there is always a leftist
[3:48:34.560 --> 3:48:36.560]  who gets the top response to President Trump's tweet.
[3:48:36.560 --> 3:48:39.560]  They can tweet or respond five minutes after Trump's tweet.
[3:48:39.560 --> 3:48:42.560]  There can be a conservative with twice the number of engagements
[3:48:42.560 --> 3:48:44.560]  and then bam, there's the Krasenstein Brothers
[3:48:44.560 --> 3:48:46.560]  with their 50,000 likes.
[3:48:46.560 --> 3:48:50.560]  Well, Twitter says they bought that engagement,
[3:48:50.560 --> 3:48:52.560]  which is a well-known practice.
[3:48:52.560 --> 3:48:53.560]  A lot of people do it.
[3:48:53.560 --> 3:48:55.560]  There's a fake or real thing you can use,
[3:48:55.560 --> 3:48:58.560]  a tool that's been released where you can actually see
[3:48:58.560 --> 3:49:00.560]  how many Twitter users on any given account,
[3:49:00.560 --> 3:49:02.560]  how many followers are fake versus real.
[3:49:02.560 --> 3:49:05.560]  And President Trump scores quite well in that, by the way.
[3:49:05.560 --> 3:49:08.560]  He has a lot of very real Twitter followers.
[3:49:08.560 --> 3:49:10.560]  But according to a Twitter spokesperson,
[3:49:10.560 --> 3:49:11.560]  this is what Twitter had to say.
[3:49:11.560 --> 3:49:12.560]  Let's just read it that way.
[3:49:12.560 --> 3:49:14.560]  Operating multiple fake accounts
[3:49:14.560 --> 3:49:17.560]  and purchasing account interactions are strictly prohibited.
[3:49:17.560 --> 3:49:19.560]  Engaging in these behaviors will result
[3:49:19.560 --> 3:49:22.560]  in permanent suspension from the service.
[3:49:22.560 --> 3:49:25.560]  The Krasenstein Brothers specifically denied this.
[3:49:25.560 --> 3:49:27.560]  They said they never purchased account interactions
[3:49:27.560 --> 3:49:29.560]  and never sold user names or bought user names.
[3:49:29.560 --> 3:49:31.560]  They said they did operate multiple accounts
[3:49:31.560 --> 3:49:32.560]  because they had multiple businesses,
[3:49:32.560 --> 3:49:36.560]  but they were not used to mislead or manipulate Twitter.
[3:49:36.560 --> 3:49:39.560]  And they said that over the last two and a half years
[3:49:39.560 --> 3:49:41.560]  as their tweets became more and more political in nature,
[3:49:41.560 --> 3:49:43.560]  people began posting their phone numbers
[3:49:43.560 --> 3:49:46.560]  and doxing them and issuing death threats.
[3:49:46.560 --> 3:49:48.560]  And so they had to use these fake accounts
[3:49:48.560 --> 3:49:50.560]  because they wanted to keep tabs on the people
[3:49:50.560 --> 3:49:51.560]  who were threatening them.
[3:49:51.560 --> 3:49:53.560]  That, to me, sounds like an exercise in masochism.
[3:49:53.560 --> 3:49:58.560]  But I just want to point out that a week or two ago,
[3:49:58.560 --> 3:50:00.560]  the very popular Twitter meme lord,
[3:50:00.560 --> 3:50:05.560]  Carpe Dongtum, was banned from Twitter, suspended.
[3:50:05.560 --> 3:50:07.560]  Because he posted a video
[3:50:07.560 --> 3:50:12.560]  that showed President Donald Trump and Jim Acosta of CNN
[3:50:12.560 --> 3:50:15.560]  in an old West style shootout scene.
[3:50:15.560 --> 3:50:16.560]  It was obviously a funny meme,
[3:50:16.560 --> 3:50:19.560]  and it was posted originally in January.
[3:50:19.560 --> 3:50:22.560]  But the Krasenstein brothers put it within their crosshairs
[3:50:22.560 --> 3:50:25.560]  and they decided to encourage their followers to report it
[3:50:25.560 --> 3:50:29.560]  and get it gone, remove it from the platform.
[3:50:29.560 --> 3:50:31.560]  And they were successful.
[3:50:31.560 --> 3:50:32.560]  They're pretty much successful.
[3:50:32.560 --> 3:50:34.560]  Carpe Dongtum was suspended.
[3:50:34.560 --> 3:50:36.560]  The tweet later disappeared.
[3:50:36.560 --> 3:50:38.560]  I don't think he deleted it, but the tweet disappeared.
[3:50:38.560 --> 3:50:41.560]  The video is no longer available.
[3:50:41.560 --> 3:50:43.560]  And the Krasenstein brothers were gloating over it.
[3:50:43.560 --> 3:50:46.560]  And so that just makes one wonder.
[3:50:46.560 --> 3:50:50.560]  This targeted harassment campaign that they led.
[3:50:50.560 --> 3:50:55.560]  Were they aiding it with the help of purchased engagement?
[3:50:55.560 --> 3:50:59.560]  Were they paying somebody to mass report this video
[3:50:59.560 --> 3:51:03.560]  so Twitter would take it down and punish the meme maker
[3:51:03.560 --> 3:51:06.560]  that President Trump retweets all the time?
[3:51:06.560 --> 3:51:08.560]  It does make you wonder.
[3:51:08.560 --> 3:51:12.560]  But I also wonder, is this the right way to handle it?
[3:51:12.560 --> 3:51:14.560]  I mean, they broke Twitter's rules.
[3:51:14.560 --> 3:51:16.560]  They did something that was objectively wrong.
[3:51:16.560 --> 3:51:18.560]  Nobody is going to argue against that.
[3:51:18.560 --> 3:51:21.560]  But do they lose their first amendment because of that?
[3:51:21.560 --> 3:51:23.560]  Is that the right way to handle it?
[3:51:23.560 --> 3:51:27.560]  Maybe instead delete some of their more egregious examples
[3:51:27.560 --> 3:51:30.560]  of using this, delete some of their very popular tweets
[3:51:30.560 --> 3:51:32.560]  that were artificially boosted,
[3:51:32.560 --> 3:51:34.560]  make them agree to never do it again,
[3:51:34.560 --> 3:51:37.560]  and let them have their dang first amendment.
[3:51:37.560 --> 3:51:39.560]  But on the other hand, these are the people who gloat
[3:51:39.560 --> 3:51:43.560]  on the time a conservative, a real Republican is banned
[3:51:43.560 --> 3:51:44.560]  or shadow banned.
[3:51:44.560 --> 3:51:45.560]  They're very happy about it.
[3:51:45.560 --> 3:51:47.560]  They think it's the best thing in the world.
[3:51:47.560 --> 3:51:49.560]  So I'm not too broken up.
[3:51:49.560 --> 3:51:50.560]  I'm just not.
[3:51:50.560 --> 3:51:51.560]  Maybe that's wrong.
[3:51:51.560 --> 3:51:52.560]  Maybe that's wrong.
[3:51:52.560 --> 3:51:53.560]  But I'm not too broken up.
[3:51:53.560 --> 3:51:57.560]  So let's turn now to 8chan.
[3:51:57.560 --> 3:52:00.560]  It's a free speech image board.
[3:52:00.560 --> 3:52:03.560]  Sometimes people oppose any things on there,
[3:52:03.560 --> 3:52:05.560]  things that I don't necessarily agree with,
[3:52:05.560 --> 3:52:07.560]  things that Alex wouldn't agree with.
[3:52:07.560 --> 3:52:09.560]  You know, they also post things that we would agree with.
[3:52:09.560 --> 3:52:12.560]  They also post things that the left might agree with.
[3:52:12.560 --> 3:52:16.560]  And the 8chan founder is speaking out after photos appear to show
[3:52:16.560 --> 3:52:21.560]  Vice News reporters breaking into his home.
[3:52:21.560 --> 3:52:25.560]  Now, remember what they said about Alex Jones.
[3:52:25.560 --> 3:52:29.560]  Just rewind your timeline a little bit if you can.
[3:52:29.560 --> 3:52:32.560]  And remember, they said that Alex Jones is sending people
[3:52:32.560 --> 3:52:38.560]  to houses of shooting survivors with guns to attack them.
[3:52:38.560 --> 3:52:42.560]  Well, that's exactly what Vice News is accused of doing,
[3:52:42.560 --> 3:52:47.560]  except instead of guns, they brought cameras going to people's houses.
[3:52:47.560 --> 3:52:51.560]  Alex Jones was totally unpersoned, totally deplatformed for this.
[3:52:51.560 --> 3:52:55.560]  But when Vice News is alleged to have done it, that's fine.
[3:52:55.560 --> 3:52:57.560]  We don't like that 8chan guy.
[3:52:57.560 --> 3:52:59.560]  He's an enemy of the deep state.
[3:52:59.560 --> 3:53:01.560]  He's a First Amendment advocate.
[3:53:01.560 --> 3:53:02.560]  Get him gone.
[3:53:02.560 --> 3:53:03.560]  That's fine.
[3:53:03.560 --> 3:53:04.560]  That's fine.
[3:53:04.560 --> 3:53:05.560]  Docs him.
[3:53:05.560 --> 3:53:06.560]  Go to his house with his kids there.
[3:53:06.560 --> 3:53:07.560]  Take photos.
[3:53:07.560 --> 3:53:08.560]  Bring a camera crew.
[3:53:08.560 --> 3:53:10.560]  Break your way into his bedroom.
[3:53:10.560 --> 3:53:11.560]  It's fine.
[3:53:11.560 --> 3:53:12.560]  It's just fine.
[3:53:12.560 --> 3:53:15.560]  The thing is, nobody can ever substantiate that with Alex Jones.
[3:53:15.560 --> 3:53:17.560]  He never said to do that.
[3:53:17.560 --> 3:53:19.560]  Never said to do that.
[3:53:19.560 --> 3:53:22.560]  But this actually is alleged to have happened.
[3:53:22.560 --> 3:53:24.560]  And there's surveillance footage.
[3:53:24.560 --> 3:53:26.560]  The guy put up a tweet saying,
[3:53:26.560 --> 3:53:31.560]  this person with a filmmaking crew just broke and entered into Jim's bedroom and were ordered out of the property.
[3:53:31.560 --> 3:53:34.560]  She and her producer have now protected their tweets.
[3:53:34.560 --> 3:53:38.560]  In other words, they got allegedly caught.
[3:53:38.560 --> 3:53:40.560]  And now they're scared.
[3:53:40.560 --> 3:53:42.560]  They realize that this doesn't look good for them.
[3:53:42.560 --> 3:53:45.560]  They realize that this is something that crazy people do.
[3:53:45.560 --> 3:53:49.560]  That Alex Jones says to do, except he never did.
[3:53:49.560 --> 3:53:52.560]  So Jim Watkins, the owner of the controversial free speech 8chan,
[3:53:52.560 --> 3:53:58.560]  has released a video on YouTube accusing liberal journalists from Vice News of illegally entering his home in the Philippines.
[3:53:58.560 --> 3:54:03.560]  He talked about Nazi Germany and the US treatment of Japanese Americans during World War II in the video
[3:54:03.560 --> 3:54:07.560]  as examples similar to the crime committed by these so-called journalists,
[3:54:07.560 --> 3:54:12.560]  who he called the equivalent of the brown shirt at his domicile.
[3:54:12.560 --> 3:54:15.560]  He said, the atrocities of the past could very well happen again
[3:54:15.560 --> 3:54:21.560]  if we as decent law-abiding folks allow this sort of behavior to be tolerated.
[3:54:21.560 --> 3:54:24.560]  He also said, when I confronted them, I was completely shocked.
[3:54:24.560 --> 3:54:27.560]  I had already told the same employees of Vice News that, quote,
[3:54:27.560 --> 3:54:29.560]  no, I did not want to be interviewed by them.
[3:54:29.560 --> 3:54:31.560]  They had no right to be in my home.
[3:54:31.560 --> 3:54:35.560]  And he also said he is apparently a staunch supporter of firearm owning.
[3:54:35.560 --> 3:54:39.560]  He's an American citizen living in the Philippines, so they don't quite have a First Amendment.
[3:54:39.560 --> 3:54:41.560]  But Rodrigo Duterte definitely likes guns.
[3:54:41.560 --> 3:54:42.560]  We'll just put it that way.
[3:54:42.560 --> 3:54:47.560]  So he said they were lucky to be alive because he may have reacted incredibly differently
[3:54:47.560 --> 3:54:53.560]  had his children not been in the home when this alleged breaking and entering occurred.
[3:54:53.560 --> 3:54:56.560]  And so this should infuriate people.
[3:54:56.560 --> 3:55:02.560]  You have Vice News accused of doing what they accused Alex Jones of doing.
[3:55:02.560 --> 3:55:03.560]  Well, ban Vice News.
[3:55:03.560 --> 3:55:05.560]  Vice News must be taken off the Internet now.
[3:55:05.560 --> 3:55:06.560]  That is the rule.
[3:55:06.560 --> 3:55:07.560]  That is the rule.
[3:55:07.560 --> 3:55:09.560]  Where is Oliver Darcy?
[3:55:09.560 --> 3:55:11.560]  Oliver Darcy, we're paging Oliver Darcy.
[3:55:11.560 --> 3:55:14.560]  Where is your campaign to get Vice News taken off the Internet?
[3:55:14.560 --> 3:55:17.560]  I demand it now.
[3:55:17.560 --> 3:55:19.560]  No, Vice News is one of the good ones.
[3:55:19.560 --> 3:55:22.560]  They're a good little progressive leftist outlet.
[3:55:22.560 --> 3:55:23.560]  So they're protected.
[3:55:23.560 --> 3:55:24.560]  They're just fine.
[3:55:24.560 --> 3:55:25.560]  They can do whatever they want.
[3:55:25.560 --> 3:55:29.560]  So with our last couple of minutes here, I want to turn over and show what's going on
[3:55:29.560 --> 3:55:32.560]  with these crazy, crazy leftists.
[3:55:32.560 --> 3:55:39.560]  We already had Nashi Heloshi who talks like she's either drunk on pills, dentures falling out,
[3:55:39.560 --> 3:55:44.560]  or has Alzheimer's, or as a great friend of mine said, maybe all.
[3:55:44.560 --> 3:55:45.560]  Maybe all of the above.
[3:55:45.560 --> 3:55:46.560]  Check all the boxes.
[3:55:46.560 --> 3:55:47.560]  Perhaps check all the boxes.
[3:55:47.560 --> 3:55:54.560]  Well, now, Jerry Nadler today, another insane leftist, passed out or at least appeared to
[3:55:54.560 --> 3:55:55.560]  pass out.
[3:55:55.560 --> 3:55:59.560]  And they said, oh, it was stuffy in the room and he was dehydrated.
[3:55:59.560 --> 3:56:00.560]  Stuffy.
[3:56:00.560 --> 3:56:01.560]  Just a little hot.
[3:56:01.560 --> 3:56:02.560]  Just a little hot.
[3:56:02.560 --> 3:56:10.560]  And the Americans back to when Hillary Clinton got overheated in a horrible, scorching, 68-degree
[3:56:10.560 --> 3:56:11.560]  day, overheated.
[3:56:11.560 --> 3:56:13.560]  There's something wrong with these leftists.
[3:56:13.560 --> 3:56:14.560]  Just look at him.
[3:56:14.560 --> 3:56:16.560]  He looks sickly and green.
[3:56:16.560 --> 3:56:18.560]  He doesn't look well.
[3:56:18.560 --> 3:56:20.560]  And all of them are like this.
[3:56:20.560 --> 3:56:25.560]  And their health, it just appears to be plummeting during the Trump administration, almost like
[3:56:25.560 --> 3:56:27.560]  hatred is bad for the body.
[3:56:27.560 --> 3:56:32.560]  And I do want to say, this is my olive branch, Mr. Nadler.
[3:56:32.560 --> 3:56:34.560]  This is the olive branch.
[3:56:34.560 --> 3:56:42.400]  I invite him and Nancy Pelosi to go to infowarstore.com because there are tremendous deals happening
[3:56:42.400 --> 3:56:44.600]  right now with the Memorial Day sale.
[3:56:44.600 --> 3:56:48.760]  And they can stock up on some of the supplements that could perhaps give them a little bit
[3:56:48.760 --> 3:56:49.760]  of vitality.
[3:56:49.760 --> 3:56:55.840]  Mr. Nadler, supermail vitality helped me lose a lot of weight, almost 100 pounds, just saying,
[3:56:55.840 --> 3:56:58.240]  maybe able to do the same for you, my friend.
[3:56:58.240 --> 3:57:02.280]  And Nancy Pelosi, might I suggest turbo force?
[3:57:02.280 --> 3:57:07.920]  It will give you the acuity, the mental fitness of perhaps, oh, a 60-year-old.
[3:57:07.920 --> 3:57:09.800]  I mean, you're 79, Ms. Pelosi.
[3:57:09.800 --> 3:57:13.920]  So I understand you may never be a young person mentally ever again, but we can at least get
[3:57:13.920 --> 3:57:15.480]  you back into the 60s.
[3:57:15.480 --> 3:57:18.800]  Maybe, maybe, maybe, just a little bit of turbo force in the morning, maybe before your
[3:57:18.800 --> 3:57:23.840]  next press conference, pop a brain force or two, we'll get you back into this morning.
[3:57:23.840 --> 3:57:24.840]  We can do it.
[3:57:24.840 --> 3:57:27.680]  And turbo force has the power.
[3:57:27.680 --> 3:57:29.120]  So I am Tom Papert.
[3:57:29.120 --> 3:57:30.280]  Facebook's got him for a trumpet.
[3:57:30.280 --> 3:57:33.360]  It's looking like I'll be back on Monday to guest host the fourth hour.
[3:57:33.360 --> 3:57:36.960]  You can, of course, catch my show every night, 8 p.m. on Facebook.
[3:57:36.960 --> 3:57:39.680]  And make sure to catch War Room coming up next.
[3:57:39.680 --> 3:57:41.680]  We'll see you next time.

[3:57:49.280 --> 3:57:53.600]  Tom and Texas police officer on the border talks about MS-13 and more.
[3:57:53.600 --> 3:57:55.600]  Thanks for calling, Tom.
[3:57:55.600 --> 3:57:56.600]  Yes, sir.

[3:58:10.600 --> 3:58:14.240]  I hand out if I get to talking to somebody just to help spread that word.
[3:58:14.240 --> 3:58:15.240]  You're our only hope, brother.
[3:58:15.240 --> 3:58:17.600]  I'm telling you, you're more important than I am.
[3:58:17.600 --> 3:58:20.880]  It's people like you on the ground, as you know, that's boots on the ground.
