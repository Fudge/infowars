[00:00.000 --> 00:12.400]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.400 --> 00:39.400]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[00:39.400 --> 00:45.880]  okay strap yourselves in yet again we always save the best for last it is
[00:45.880 --> 00:54.120]  friday the 27th day of january 2012 hard to believe that when we're back with
[00:54.120 --> 00:59.400]  you next week we'll be into the second month of 2012 that's only 11 months left
[00:59.400 --> 01:02.880]  on planet earth before we're all dead because the Mayans who couldn't even
[01:02.880 --> 01:07.960]  invent a wheel said so actually they were amazing mathematicians and had a
[01:07.960 --> 01:12.640]  very interesting culture and took hallucinogens almost daily their
[01:12.640 --> 01:17.200]  leadership did and actually they didn't say that the world's gonna end at 2012
[01:17.200 --> 01:23.560]  that's when the age ends they believe but I don't put stock in superstition but
[01:23.560 --> 01:27.520]  the establishment certainly does and they're trying to start wars bring in
[01:27.520 --> 01:33.600]  the new world order all of this and using this is a self-fulfilling prophecy
[01:33.600 --> 01:38.200]  2012 and the rest of it and the mainline christian church is always saying it's
[01:38.200 --> 01:42.200]  the end of the world every five minutes so everybody stands down imagine if our
[01:42.200 --> 01:46.080]  forebearers always thought it was the end of the world and didn't get involved
[01:46.080 --> 01:50.360]  in fighting evil where we'd be all I know is it could be the end of the world
[01:50.360 --> 01:55.000]  next month I doubt it you know Jesus Christ could come back tomorrow like a
[01:55.000 --> 02:00.720]  thief in the night I'm still going to confront corruption because I can't
[02:00.720 --> 02:06.360]  control myself I am compelled to do it and not because I have some instinct to
[02:06.360 --> 02:11.160]  being a goody two shoes and I'm so great and wonderful it's because I can't
[02:11.160 --> 02:17.520]  stand evil corrupt control freak liars I like to teach people how to do things I
[02:17.520 --> 02:24.920]  like to build things I like beautiful things I like the good guys I believe in
[02:24.920 --> 02:30.520]  humanity and I see the corrupt manipulators for what they are and they
[02:30.520 --> 02:39.360]  drive me crazy and I don't like them so that's why I do what I do I feel violent
[02:39.360 --> 02:45.360]  towards evil people I feel quite frankly hateful but I do what I do because I
[02:45.360 --> 02:49.280]  love innocence I was looking at my three-year-old daughter this morning with
[02:49.280 --> 02:55.040]  a ponytail up on the top of her head I mean just a spitting image of a doll and
[02:55.040 --> 03:00.040]  sweeter than anything you can imagine we've also got a puppy that runs around
[03:00.040 --> 03:04.520]  hissing and biting and making cute noises I mean it's like this planet is
[03:04.520 --> 03:09.480]  just covered with incredible stuff wonderful entities that I want to
[03:09.480 --> 03:19.200]  protect from injustice from barbarism from war I don't like it and I will
[03:19.200 --> 03:23.160]  fight fire with fire and that's what we're doing here my friends we're not
[03:23.160 --> 03:30.680]  playing games okay I'm already ranting we've got two special news reports one
[03:30.680 --> 03:35.720]  of which premiered last night on the nightly news but I'm gonna give you a
[03:35.720 --> 03:40.280]  more concise focus commentary on it when we come back that's confirmed
[03:40.280 --> 03:45.720]  rendition center FEMA camps in the United States and the the camps where
[03:45.720 --> 03:50.480]  they take you on the buses and the army trucks to then interrogate and send
[03:50.480 --> 03:54.640]  people for execution send people for foreign interrogation and torture and
[03:54.640 --> 04:00.720]  reeducation or domestic or just those that they want to arrest with quote
[04:00.720 --> 04:04.760]  dissidents so people think that they're actually a good guy to insert spies
[04:04.760 --> 04:10.520]  within the resistance and there's some other subsets as well it's also just
[04:10.520 --> 04:14.040]  scaring people into serving the system when they take them to the camp so four
[04:14.040 --> 04:17.720]  different groups of people historically that are brought to the camps through the
[04:17.720 --> 04:23.040]  globalist interrogation methods that I have infiltrated and observed in police
[04:23.040 --> 04:27.160]  day 2000 you can see me get into Marine Corps interrogation training center and
[04:27.160 --> 04:31.040]  the spokesman the civilian spokesman have been following me around all day
[04:31.040 --> 04:34.960]  freaked out said don't any of this get out of here that's it you're thrown out

[08:40.880 --> 08:48.560]  dealing with the fact that FEMA camp rendition federal kidnapping hub sites
[08:48.560 --> 08:55.320]  have been identified and of course not only have we identified a new site I've
[08:55.320 --> 08:59.080]  made some phone calls and done some checking it indeed is some type of high
[08:59.080 --> 09:06.960]  security prisoner extraction holding facility at lax but it mirrors other
[09:06.960 --> 09:11.920]  facilities at Berkshire international in Austin the old Robert Mueller pier
[09:11.920 --> 09:18.200]  57 in New York all of it I'm going to recap that and then get into these
[09:18.200 --> 09:26.200]  reports here in just a moment but coming up in the second-hour author and
[09:26.200 --> 09:31.680]  researcher and former political prisoner author of bloodlines of the
[09:31.680 --> 09:37.200]  Illuminati Fritz spring mire will be joining us then we have dr. Stan
[09:37.200 --> 09:41.920]  Monty's he'll be riding shotgun with us with Bob Chapman during his weekly
[09:41.920 --> 09:47.840]  visit rarely does Monty actually contact us and say hey I want to come on he said
[09:47.840 --> 09:52.400]  he's talked to a CFR individual and has some big intel on the upcoming strike on
[09:52.400 --> 09:58.480]  Iran speaking of that Iran is saying they're gonna let the UN IEA back into
[09:58.480 --> 10:03.520]  inspector nuclear sites Israel says that they're bluffing on attacks and we'll
[10:03.520 --> 10:09.840]  basically back off if pressures continually put on them that's in the
[10:09.840 --> 10:15.640]  New York Times and Jerusalem Post gold prices are soaring on Fed news and
[10:15.640 --> 10:19.720]  other factors they've announced they're going to start quantitative easing three
[10:19.720 --> 10:25.160]  that means big-time inflation there's also reports that GDP actually imploded
[10:25.160 --> 10:30.960]  in the last year 1.2% and that's even with cook numbers also they're
[10:30.960 --> 10:36.640]  spinning leaked video that shows Rand Paul wasn't
[10:36.640 --> 10:48.040]  basically I rate at the facility and that he was detained it shows him
[10:48.040 --> 10:51.880]  in a cubicle with police around it keeping him there and and the TSA's
[10:51.880 --> 10:56.520]  released a small clip of it acting like that's the entirety of how long Rand
[10:56.520 --> 11:00.600]  Paul was there when he said it was close to two hours and witnesses have said
[11:00.600 --> 11:06.440]  that so they're it's incredible how they will spend things that is coming up
[11:06.440 --> 11:14.080]  as well Obama accused of contempt of court in Berther hearing Secretary of
[11:14.080 --> 11:19.560]  State warns Obama a miss hearing at your own peril they are trying to make him
[11:19.560 --> 11:23.160]  show up for this hearing to prove a citizenship we know he did have a fake
[11:23.160 --> 11:26.920]  social security number of somebody else's out of Connecticut we do know
[11:26.920 --> 11:30.960]  his files are sealed we do know he went by other names we do know his entire
[11:30.960 --> 11:41.280]  family was CIA continuing with some of that news we'll be breaking that down
[11:41.280 --> 11:47.480]  with Obama and his car company that he's backed with the battery operated
[11:47.480 --> 11:51.360]  system is filing for bankruptcy that was just basically a shell corporation
[11:51.360 --> 11:57.200]  that they used to pay off some of their political contributors so that's all
[11:57.200 --> 12:03.160]  coming up today and a lot more also there's a big manufactured controversy
[12:03.160 --> 12:11.720]  really it's a jealousy issue by the king of the terrible dinosaur media the
[12:11.720 --> 12:17.480]  globalist media New York Times more and more becoming a non-issue just just
[12:17.480 --> 12:22.200]  dwindling and shriveling up to nothing like a vampire that's hit by the sun at
[12:22.200 --> 12:29.200]  high noon conservatives criticized drudge for anti-genrich assault and all
[12:29.200 --> 12:33.880]  drudge did the last three days was linked to all of the major conservative
[12:33.880 --> 12:43.800]  sites from the Washington Times to Forbes to I mean you name it national
[12:43.800 --> 12:51.520]  review pointing out that genrich has been for open borders carbon taxes called
[12:51.520 --> 12:58.600]  for global government all this stuff I mean that's who newt genrich is and so
[12:58.600 --> 13:02.920]  the New York Times is acting like conservatives are mad at the drudge
[13:02.920 --> 13:07.760]  report when these aren't conservatives that are defending newt genrich I mean
[13:07.760 --> 13:13.360]  it is ridiculous to claim that conservatives are defending newt
[13:13.360 --> 13:19.000]  genrich newt genrich is a joke and let me let me get this straight I don't like
[13:19.000 --> 13:23.200]  Mitt Romney he's for carbon taxes he's been for abortion in the past he wrote
[13:23.200 --> 13:29.400]  Obamacare he's a globalist big time but he's not as evil as newt genrich I mean
[13:29.400 --> 13:35.280]  newt genrich is anti-family anti-us sovereignty and has written articles
[13:35.280 --> 13:39.400]  that I've read on air calling for it that the so-called conservatives that are
[13:39.400 --> 13:43.960]  attacking him they're just more rhinos genrich is so extreme that rhinos don't
[13:43.960 --> 13:50.120]  even like him okay and so the New York Times claim conservatives criticize
[13:50.120 --> 13:54.840]  drudge for anti-genrich assault furious conservatives have taken to blogs in
[13:54.840 --> 13:59.200]  Twitter on Thursday to vent their ire against what they allege is
[13:59.200 --> 14:03.480]  conspiratorial dumping of twisted and manipulative negative attacks on newt
[14:03.480 --> 14:07.880]  genrich see when you can think for yourself it's called a conspiracy it's
[14:07.880 --> 14:19.560]  called conspiracy theory and it makes my head spin that this type of stuff goes
[14:19.560 --> 14:25.520]  on now it has come out it's been all over the news the last week that almost
[14:25.520 --> 14:30.360]  all of genrich's twitter responses in fact Aaron was showing me in the article
[14:30.360 --> 14:36.120]  he was like 90 something percent guys print 90 percent I don't know the exact
[14:36.120 --> 14:43.360]  percent it's 90 plus but just say 90% type in fake genrich twitter responses
[14:43.360 --> 14:48.080]  and it'll it'll pop up that's the same thing with Romney it's the same thing
[14:48.080 --> 14:51.120]  with all these guys and it's come out that Romney and genrich that their
[14:51.120 --> 14:56.000]  crowds are almost completely paid for and fake and when he doesn't have paid
[14:56.000 --> 15:01.240]  people that then he has no one there for him and then Ron Paul's this rockstar
[15:01.240 --> 15:06.000]  there's election fraud in South Carolina folks there was election fraud in Iowa
[15:06.000 --> 15:09.960]  there's gonna be election fraud in Florida Ron Paul is the frontrunner
[15:09.960 --> 15:14.120]  every article I go to I type in Ron Paul into search engine a couple times
[15:14.120 --> 15:20.160]  today every article is five to one ten to one you name it for Ron Paul in
[15:20.160 --> 15:24.720]  articles attacking him in neutral articles you name it in articles that
[15:24.720 --> 15:29.240]  don't mention Ron Paul they're about Mitt Romney and genrich it's all Ron Paul
[15:29.240 --> 15:34.680]  supporters I mean it's a fraud it's a hoax just like the New York Times is a
[15:34.680 --> 15:40.040]  hoax the New York Times makes hundreds of millions of dollars a year last time
[15:40.040 --> 15:44.640]  I check is like 500 million a year and they still had a shortfall of hundreds
[15:44.640 --> 15:49.080]  of millions and they have less visitors in the drudge report and the drudge
[15:49.080 --> 15:55.720]  report probably makes four or five million a year again it's a hoax info
[15:55.720 --> 16:01.560]  wars.com dozens of times bigger than MSNBC.com we make a fraction of what
[16:01.560 --> 16:06.760]  they do because when the global corporate sell-out slug new world order
[16:06.760 --> 16:14.520]  trash there it is report time magazine 92% of Newt Genrich's Twitter followers
[16:14.520 --> 16:25.240]  aren't real anyways there it is show the globalist tithe to the media they know
[16:25.240 --> 16:29.320]  it's a failure they know it doesn't make money they know it's not popular they
[16:29.320 --> 16:36.160]  they pay for it so that there's at least an echo chamber of propaganda I mean
[16:36.160 --> 16:42.640]  how is that how is it that info wars.com conservatively last time I
[16:42.640 --> 16:47.200]  checked the metric gets about 50 plus times the traffic of the Austin
[16:47.200 --> 16:52.240]  American statesman and the Austin America statesman makes tens upon tens
[16:52.240 --> 16:56.920]  upon tens of millions of dollars I think last time I checked you know it's
[16:56.920 --> 17:01.160]  grossing something like 50 60 million a year I forget you can pull it up it's
[17:01.160 --> 17:06.360]  like I forget if it's 90 or 92 it's 92% of his Twitter followers are fake all I
[17:06.360 --> 17:10.800]  know is is that I'm much bigger than a big giant building full of all these
[17:10.800 --> 17:15.760]  employees that no one reads no one trusts and no one listens to but it's
[17:15.760 --> 17:19.840]  emperors new clothes everybody goes along with it that they're the biggest
[17:19.840 --> 17:24.760]  thing in the world so everyone just bows down to it all day like it is
[17:24.760 --> 17:30.760]  all right I'm I'm digressing here I just read an article like this and it is the
[17:30.760 --> 17:36.520]  the the the discredited New York Times that is hanging on by its fingernails to
[17:36.520 --> 17:41.080]  any readership any credibility any anything and that's why they're gonna
[17:41.080 --> 17:44.280]  try to shut down freedom on the web that's why they're delisting info wars
[17:44.280 --> 17:48.640]  and prison planet from Google news that's why they're censoring us on
[17:48.640 --> 17:51.520]  military bases and government buildings all over the world they're
[17:51.520 --> 17:57.040]  censoring us folks because they're scared to death they know we are
[17:57.040 --> 18:02.520]  absolutely on a tilted football field going uphill getting touchdowns beating
[18:02.520 --> 18:06.760]  them so they just want to shut down the entire game even though we're going
[18:06.760 --> 18:13.840]  uphill dragging balls and chains behind us they want to shut down the entire
[18:13.840 --> 18:19.000]  game and just flip the field straight up so we fall down into Hades basically
[18:19.000 --> 18:22.920]  we're gonna skip this network break because I'm on a time schedule with
[18:22.920 --> 18:26.480]  three guests coming up and I've got to get to both these special reports that
[18:26.480 --> 18:29.480]  we're about to cover so I'm skipping this network break stations I know out

[18:55.480 --> 18:59.680]  internet treaty worse than Sopa White House bypasses Senate to Inc. agreement
[18:59.680 --> 19:04.920]  that could allow Chinese companies to demand ISPs remove web content in US
[19:04.920 --> 19:09.280]  with no legal oversight Paul Watson's in China right now with his wife that's why
[19:09.280 --> 19:12.720]  I was reading it in the Chinese papers and wrote this from China low and

[19:57.440 --> 20:01.480]  at high noon and blown away all they want to do now is take us down with them
[20:01.480 --> 20:05.560]  and shut us down because they're in total panic that's why the White House
[20:05.560 --> 20:10.040]  regulations are is back in the news saying shut down people that don't agree
[20:10.040 --> 20:14.400]  with them shut down websites that criticize electric cars he was in the
[20:14.400 --> 20:19.080]  news two days ago saying that I mean you talk about twilight zone tyrant level
[20:19.080 --> 20:24.760]  control freak spasms and temper tantrums publicly but these scum are in
[20:24.760 --> 20:28.440]  control they've hijacked the country so just because everybody knows they're a
[20:28.440 --> 20:33.920]  pack of lion crooks doesn't mean that we're not in deep trouble oh it makes
[20:33.920 --> 20:38.960]  me want to throw up and worse news out today EU signs the active global
[20:38.960 --> 20:45.640]  internet censorship treaty all the European countries have signed on
[20:45.640 --> 20:49.240]  Japan signed on they all love the censorship it's here get ready they're
[20:49.240 --> 20:55.840]  coming for us because they can't stand it they can't stand the fact that they
[20:55.840 --> 20:59.280]  can't sit there and be arrogant media whores anymore and that no one wants to
[20:59.280 --> 21:07.720]  listen to him now this is a breaking news report here these are excerpts from my
[21:07.720 --> 21:16.480]  film martial law my film police state to the takeover that's from 2000 and for
[21:16.480 --> 21:24.120]  martial law 2005 confirming that they have these FEMA funded hubs and San
[21:24.120 --> 21:28.040]  Point Naval Brig in Seattle where they put political protesters under FEMA's
[21:28.040 --> 21:35.040]  control and then you tie that into the emergency centers establishment act and
[21:35.040 --> 21:40.040]  you tie that in to all the admissions that they have these hubs at airports
[21:40.040 --> 21:44.840]  like they have here at Austin at the old Robert Mueller and at the new airport
[21:44.840 --> 21:50.400]  Bergstrom they have these holding hubs with porta potties cots bolts and chains
[21:50.400 --> 21:54.840]  in the floor to hold political dissidents and this has been admitted for
[21:54.840 --> 22:01.200]  more than 13 years that we've known of when Rob do my reporter he's suing right
[22:01.200 --> 22:06.080]  now they're trying to settle with him Pittsburgh Pennsylvania over arresting
[22:06.080 --> 22:10.040]  him for videotaping from a hilltop them beating and arresting protesters they
[22:10.040 --> 22:13.560]  took them to a military base they had people getting off trucks with bags on
[22:13.560 --> 22:16.840]  their heads and the police were all there with the military shut up with the
[22:16.840 --> 22:23.380]  computer terminals running and all so military bases sports stadiums in fact
[22:23.380 --> 22:28.280]  that's in the news today about the sports stadiums that's in the Miami
[22:28.280 --> 22:33.920]  newspaper they want to put the homeless basically forcibly in the ballparks and
[22:33.920 --> 22:40.400]  stadiums that's Miami Herald so all of that's going on you got urban warfare
[22:40.400 --> 22:46.480]  drills everywhere and we get sent photos from lax in an area and we went and
[22:46.480 --> 22:50.920]  checked the Google Earth I made some phone calls and confirmed it is an
[22:50.920 --> 22:56.280]  emergency center of the police and FEMA that's all police that I've talked to
[22:56.280 --> 23:00.280]  know and the word is it's going to be used to hold people to take them out to
[23:00.280 --> 23:03.440]  the airfield and split up and break up different groups that are going to
[23:03.440 --> 23:07.160]  rendition centers that are going to overseas torture camps that are be
[23:07.160 --> 23:09.720]  taken that are being taken to other federal facilities so this is a
[23:09.720 --> 23:15.760]  rendition mothership area so I want to go to this video report from past and
[23:15.760 --> 23:21.760]  present it first starts out in 2004 in New York here it is we're in New York
[23:21.760 --> 23:26.880]  City right here on the Hudson River and this condemned former bus station where
[23:26.880 --> 23:31.600]  they stored the buses is being used to hold over 2,000 protesters and they
[23:31.600 --> 23:36.680]  admit that they randomly set up fences and scoop up whole crowds of people and
[23:36.680 --> 23:41.720]  then take them here and for over three days they've not let people talk to
[23:41.720 --> 23:46.240]  lawyers call out talk to their families some have been released some have gone
[23:46.240 --> 23:50.120]  to the hospital with rashes over their entire bodies this building is condemned
[23:50.120 --> 23:55.400]  the city admits it the bus union wouldn't allow them to use it years
[23:55.400 --> 23:59.280]  ago so they turned it into an emergency police facility it's full of asbestos
[23:59.280 --> 24:04.840]  chemicals oils from decades and decades and decades in this 70 year old building
[24:04.840 --> 24:09.160]  and the average stay for someone scooped up in there is over 24 hours the city
[24:09.160 --> 24:14.080]  even admits that many of the nearly 2,000 protesters arrested over the past
[24:14.080 --> 24:18.360]  few days have been taken to an old bus depot on Manhattan's west side but now
[24:18.360 --> 24:22.040]  the use of peer 57 is a temporary holding facility is stirring up some
[24:22.040 --> 24:26.360]  controversy of its own protests are being held there to spotlight conditions
[24:26.360 --> 24:30.320]  some of those being detained say they're getting sick there are reports of
[24:30.320 --> 24:34.760]  cramped conditions rashes chemical burns and difficulty breathing we should
[24:34.760 --> 24:38.840]  call this facility what it is and it's a concentration camp it's the peer 57
[24:38.840 --> 24:43.320]  concentration camp the mayor has has the nerve and the police commissioner has
[24:43.320 --> 24:47.300]  a nerve to allow this to happen to actually stick people in a in an oil
[24:47.300 --> 24:52.760]  filled garage with asbestos across the nation at airports and old military
[24:52.760 --> 24:58.160]  bases they're installing hangers and structures to intern the American
[24:58.160 --> 25:02.560]  people under military control they're also integrating local police you've
[25:02.560 --> 25:07.840]  already seen some of the evidence but even the town where I live Austin Texas
[25:07.840 --> 25:13.660]  is not immune from these activities we're told there is a holding facility
[25:13.660 --> 25:21.160]  here on the old Robert Mueller municipal airport a hanger to hold people have
[25:21.160 --> 25:29.480]  you been inside there how did they fix it up well you probably don't
[25:29.480 --> 25:33.160]  recognize it but it's an abandoned hangar at the old airport just off 51st
[25:33.160 --> 25:36.960]  Street today and tomorrow shares employees are turning this place into a
[25:36.960 --> 25:42.080]  booking center and even a holding cell now it really doesn't look like much
[25:42.080 --> 25:46.200]  and okay it's really not but it is a perfect place to set up shop anyone
[25:46.200 --> 25:49.800]  arrested in the Travis County area during the New Year's Eve party for a
[25:49.800 --> 25:53.480]  classy misdemeanor will be brought out here sheriff's officials tell me it's
[25:53.480 --> 25:57.000]  pretty primitive inmates will be fingerprinted and allowed two free phone
[25:57.000 --> 26:00.440]  calls then they'll be held here for about four hours just enough time to
[26:00.440 --> 26:04.120]  sober up then they'll be released and expected to appear in court in the future
[26:04.120 --> 26:07.600]  only people who have ID on them will be brought out here since they won't have
[26:07.600 --> 26:11.000]  the capability to run fingerprint checks and they're mostly expecting people
[26:11.000 --> 26:15.520]  arrested for public intoxication down in the a2k in 6th Street areas this
[26:15.520 --> 26:19.200]  temporary booking facility opens up for business tomorrow night that's Thursday
[26:19.200 --> 26:25.520]  at 8 o'clock we're hoping to get staff acclimated to working in this
[26:25.520 --> 26:31.640]  environment starting tomorrow with hopefully a low volume of arrests so
[26:31.640 --> 26:36.200]  hopefully by come Friday night everyone will know how the flow is going to work
[26:36.200 --> 26:40.760]  in here and be used to it the holding cell is surrounded by this chain link
[26:40.760 --> 26:43.640]  fence and the fire marshal has told the sheriff's department that they can hold
[26:43.640 --> 26:47.880]  about 380 people in here and the sheriff's deputies are ready for a busy
[26:47.880 --> 26:52.400]  night anyone who got in their way was arrested and shipped to a FEMA center
[26:52.400 --> 26:59.360]  the federal emergency management agency in direct violation of Posse Comontonis
[26:59.360 --> 27:04.720]  had Delta Force on the ground from day one of the demonstrations and protest
[27:04.720 --> 27:10.520]  continually integrating the local state county and city police under federal
[27:10.520 --> 27:16.720]  command this should be a giant red flag for any American concerned about their
[27:16.720 --> 27:22.800]  God-given rights and their freedom in this country at least 250 perhaps more
[27:22.800 --> 27:26.120]  and those that have been taken into custody from the streets of downtown
[27:26.120 --> 27:30.680]  Seattle protesting for a variety of reasons the world trade ministers here
[27:30.680 --> 27:34.440]  on their visit you see them here with their hands pretty much cuffed behind
[27:34.440 --> 27:40.360]  their backs with those plastic sort of strap handcuffed apparatus they are
[27:40.360 --> 27:44.840]  being led into the Sandpoint Brig remember we told you about this story
[27:44.840 --> 27:47.640]  dancing all the way in some cases we told you about this story a couple of
[27:47.640 --> 27:51.200]  weeks ago a number of the neighbors in that area of Sandpoint naval air station
[27:51.200 --> 27:55.680]  were shocked to hear that the old Brig was being reopened just in case it was
[27:55.680 --> 28:00.560]  needed and it has been as we said at least 250 arrests now maybe more and
[28:00.560 --> 28:05.040]  we've seen 400 people arrested the facility at Sandpoint we're told this
[28:05.040 --> 28:09.120]  fall we're told they did not create another one at Boeing field but they
[28:09.120 --> 28:13.360]  continue to arrest people and they continue to crack down hard on the
[28:13.360 --> 28:17.240]  protesters this afternoon the worst thing is as I finally saw something my own
[28:17.240 --> 28:21.120]  eyes one thing to talk about it here people talk about it on the radio I saw
[28:21.120 --> 28:27.080]  this with my own eyes at LAX Los Angeles Airport they've built a giant human
[28:27.080 --> 28:33.160]  holding pen it's obvious quite obvious what it's for the processing people this
[28:33.160 --> 28:36.520]  thing they used to park all of our limousines and cars and buses at the
[28:36.520 --> 28:40.920]  eastern end of the north set of runways there's two sets of runways at LAX they
[28:40.920 --> 28:44.520]  used to park all of us at the eastern end of the north runway where the planes
[28:44.520 --> 28:48.040]  would land right over the top they moved us all out of there this past summer
[28:48.040 --> 28:51.280]  which I thought was strange what I saw was when I pulled in there and I was
[28:51.280 --> 28:55.600]  followed twice by the cops when I pulled in on the pictures this thing is it's a
[28:55.600 --> 28:59.280]  holding pen it could hold thousands of people it's right next to the tarmac
[28:59.280 --> 29:03.320]  there's no buildings no nothing it's like a 10 or 12 foot fence with a
[29:03.320 --> 29:07.880]  permanent concrete base around the base of it and there's two sets of barbed
[29:07.880 --> 29:12.240]  wire on top facing in and out so you know there's there's fences I got all
[29:12.240 --> 29:16.720]  over out the airport area they actually have one of those at Bergstrom and at the
[29:16.720 --> 29:22.040]  old airport and I first reported it was a secret holding pen but the news said
[29:22.040 --> 29:26.880]  I was a conspiracy theorist but that it was to hold people during civil unrest so
[29:26.880 --> 29:31.840]  I'm bad for being right and breaking the news I don't get an award I'm bad
[29:31.840 --> 29:36.920]  because I'm right and it's cookie not to like it what's going on at the old
[29:36.920 --> 29:41.680]  airport this is where the party could end up walls of a2k and why 2k partiers
[29:41.680 --> 29:47.400]  do get out of hand these turstiles okay we're gonna go to break we're gonna back

[33:08.600 --> 33:15.760]  well I won't back down okay we've got a special report I shot and compiled
[33:15.760 --> 33:20.440]  there in Dykes yesterday you can stand me and I don't know how you describe
[33:20.440 --> 33:24.600]  their incredible lies the only thing that isn't done is that I haven't titled
[33:24.600 --> 33:32.800]  this yet TSA defines deception the TSA are the world's biggest liars and the
[33:32.800 --> 33:38.680]  world's biggest liar award goes to the TSA I don't I don't know what title to
[33:38.680 --> 33:42.000]  give it I think we're gonna air this piece and then give it a title and then
[33:42.000 --> 33:48.080]  put it on prisonplanet.tv and YouTube and post it on infowars.com and
[33:48.080 --> 33:56.120]  prisonplanet.com but again the piece you just heard is excerpts from a film I
[33:56.120 --> 34:01.040]  made in 2000 police state to the takeover a film I made in 2005 Marshall
[34:01.040 --> 34:08.320]  Law and it's the footage of FEMA running the military and police putting
[34:08.320 --> 34:18.360]  citizens in a FEMA camp in Seattle FEMA ran setting up these same detainment
[34:18.360 --> 34:23.920]  facilities at the airport here in Austin they're still there and then sold
[34:23.920 --> 34:27.720]  it like well it's pretty rioting during you know Mardi Gras or during the new
[34:27.720 --> 34:31.600]  year they just sit there but it was cops that told me about it I knew about it
[34:31.600 --> 34:39.000]  before it was on the news and then we have this new report and the photos that
[34:39.000 --> 34:42.000]  we're showing on the radio but we have the eyewitness there and we've done
[34:42.000 --> 34:48.040]  some research it is indeed a high security area and is built on to the
[34:48.040 --> 34:52.480]  flight path so they can just put people on board the aircraft bar bar facing
[34:52.480 --> 34:57.600]  in and out turnstools that are one-way prison style places for buses to pull
[34:57.600 --> 35:04.640]  in ultra super creepy and clearly a rendition center so breaking FEMA camp
[35:04.640 --> 35:10.600]  rendition hubs discovered past and present that just played you newscasts
[35:10.600 --> 35:14.480]  what they're saying FEMA's running putting the citizens in the naval brig
[35:14.480 --> 35:18.680]  and what does the emergency centers act say from last year they tried to pass
[35:18.680 --> 35:22.040]  they tried to just legalize what's already there in the bill that they'll
[35:22.040 --> 35:27.760]  use the old military bases Briggs under FEMA to hold people during emergencies
[35:27.760 --> 35:31.680]  and civil unrest what are they saying in the Miami Herald let's put all the
[35:31.680 --> 35:35.000]  homeless people in the sports stadiums what did I tell you was coming during
[35:35.000 --> 35:38.800]  the economic collapse it's all this has been done in other countries I've watched
[35:38.800 --> 35:42.200]  the congressional hearings on it I've read the emergency centers act I've
[35:42.200 --> 35:46.640]  read the military commission's act I've read the civilian and mate labor camp
[35:46.640 --> 35:54.120]  program declassified in 97 by Clinton they had us prisoners in secret prisons
[35:54.120 --> 35:59.120]  run by the military regular us prisoners for decades before Bill Clinton
[35:59.120 --> 36:05.520]  declassified it there's real camps already and you can't get the corporate
[36:05.520 --> 36:11.160]  dinosaur media to cover it they're now saying it's a conspiracy theory that
[36:11.160 --> 36:17.000]  drudge is linking to articles showing that newt genrich isn't conservative that's
[36:17.000 --> 36:21.200]  mind control if you say lemon pie is lemon pie they go conspiracy if you
[36:21.200 --> 36:25.480]  say milk is white they say conspiracy you say sky is blue you have all the
[36:25.480 --> 36:30.360]  documents about FEMA camps and they're building the hubs everywhere and they
[36:30.360 --> 36:35.040]  look at you and say it's a conspiracy theory they talk to you like you're an
[36:35.040 --> 36:39.400]  idiot they're still saying there's no world government as it's being announced
[36:39.400 --> 36:45.240]  let's go back to the end of the piece this is going on right now at lax here
[36:45.240 --> 36:48.880]  it is brand new turnstiles let me describe them because that you could
[36:48.880 --> 36:52.480]  say well it's part of an airport now these things are these are those big
[36:52.480 --> 36:56.920]  two-beater steel turnstiles they go in they don't come back out there's no way
[36:56.920 --> 37:01.120]  to get back out there's four sets of them so there's like 16 turnstiles to go
[37:01.120 --> 37:05.400]  into this thing and it's like the size of three-foot you can get thousands of
[37:05.400 --> 37:09.600]  people the weird the thing about it that proves what it is it's because there's
[37:09.600 --> 37:13.160]  it on the fence that goes to the under the tarmac it goes straight onto the
[37:13.160 --> 37:17.360]  airport tarmac where you know what kind of security is that they put a big black
[37:17.360 --> 37:22.880]  gate that you can you could pull trucks buses whatever into this holding so it's
[37:22.880 --> 37:27.880]  built to move lots of people quickly into this pen and then move them onto the
[37:27.880 --> 37:32.400]  tarmac what is that for you know except to move people and put them on the
[37:32.400 --> 37:36.920]  aircraft oh no that's like the Oklahoma City Federal Processing Center and this
[37:36.920 --> 37:40.480]  is this is actually all the emergency centers established you can watch the
[37:40.480 --> 37:45.680]  rest of the report at info wars.com it's in the article by Kurt Nemo that just
[37:45.680 --> 37:49.560]  went up minutes ago FEMA camp rendition hubs discovered we're gonna
[37:49.560 --> 37:55.440]  Twitter this out as well please retweet it get this article out to everyone you
[37:55.440 --> 38:01.360]  know please and in it we've got KBR putting out the contracts to man the
[38:01.360 --> 38:05.880]  FEMA camps and admitting it's for civil unrest the barbed wire the stock age it's
[38:05.880 --> 38:12.280]  all there it's all proven in this article by Nemo with the video that this is a
[38:12.280 --> 38:15.880]  long-term program I got to get Kurt to add the part about it they want to put
[38:15.880 --> 38:19.520]  the homeless in sports stadiums and lock them up at night for their own
[38:19.520 --> 38:22.640]  safety that's already happening in California in Sacramento I sent
[38:22.640 --> 38:27.000]  reporters there two years ago on that now shifting gears into another big
[38:27.000 --> 38:31.280]  report that we're premiering here on the radio and to those watching on prison
[38:31.280 --> 38:38.320]  planet dot TV this new special report breaks down just some of the lies of the
[38:38.320 --> 38:44.400]  incredibly manipulative and deceptive TSA here it is
[38:48.480 --> 38:54.520]  you to go places and half the time it takes to travel by car for some trips
[38:54.520 --> 39:00.080]  it'll be faster than flying without the Pat down it's the sort of security we've
[39:00.080 --> 39:04.160]  seen a lot of since 9-11 in places like airports and now here at the bus
[39:04.160 --> 39:09.480]  station at the credible resets threats that are causing what some believe to
[39:09.480 --> 39:14.040]  be these invasive invasive screening tactics Robin we know the threats are
[39:14.040 --> 39:17.600]  real and we have seen this latest information coming out of al-Qaeda
[39:17.600 --> 39:22.800]  Arabian Peninsula remind Americans why we now check our liquids it's because a
[39:22.800 --> 39:27.960]  mother was willing to blow up the baby and the entire plane right with the
[39:27.960 --> 39:31.800]  liquids right Department of Homeland Security has not been forthcoming with
[39:31.800 --> 39:35.920]  the public about the true extent of radiation risk advanced imaging
[39:35.920 --> 39:39.440]  technology would not have discovered the type of bond that Omar Farouk Abdul
[39:39.440 --> 39:45.320]  Matala had had secreted in his underwear well I think reasonable people may may
[39:45.320 --> 39:49.960]  disagree on that we are not retaining we are not keeping they're not designed
[39:49.960 --> 39:54.520]  for that at all the TSA is reiterating today that although its machines can
[39:54.520 --> 39:59.680]  store images when they're being tested quote all functionality to store export
[39:59.680 --> 40:05.680]  or print images is disabled throughout history and in every culture there is a
[40:05.680 --> 40:11.920]  basic precept of law that if someone has been caught lying before what's the
[40:11.920 --> 40:16.080]  difference between lying and misleading Congress it all has to do with your
[40:16.080 --> 40:20.160]  state of mind and whether or not you had the requisite intent to come up with
[40:20.160 --> 40:24.720]  something that can be considered perjury or a lie you should not believe anything
[40:24.720 --> 40:38.040]  else that they tell you and when someone has been confirmed to be a congenital or
[40:38.040 --> 40:45.360]  serial liar you're a fool to believe anything they say it has been months and
[40:45.360 --> 40:50.240]  you tell me that you're not you weren't you weren't doing it because of an IG
[40:50.240 --> 40:53.400]  investigation let's go through a few questions here madam well wait wait
[40:53.400 --> 40:58.280]  just wait let me finish my question madam secretary let me finish my
[40:58.280 --> 41:03.880]  question that insinuation is not your you know about the TSA and their
[41:03.880 --> 41:09.240]  pension for molesting children raping women in parking lots robbing luggage
[41:09.240 --> 41:15.080]  stealing cash out of wallets beating people up and then lying about them you
[41:15.080 --> 41:20.160]  know about their pension for a child porn and the incredible statistical
[41:20.160 --> 41:25.360]  analysis that we've seen that they are predisposed to engage in crime no
[41:25.360 --> 41:30.280]  kidding who else wants a job groping men women and children all day and making
[41:30.280 --> 41:35.240]  old ladies who can't walk crawl out of wheelchairs and ripping colostomy bags
[41:35.240 --> 41:40.640]  off of people's sides who else wants to abuse people all day but criminals and
[41:40.640 --> 41:46.440]  control freaks but in this report I want to look at just some of their lies
[41:46.440 --> 41:53.800]  because they're constantly lying and the prostitute trader stream media that
[41:53.800 --> 41:59.600]  serves the globalist and these brown shirts of the federal takeover need to
[41:59.600 --> 42:03.840]  all be called on the carpet now let's just look at the latest lie that came
[42:03.840 --> 42:09.000]  out today the Tennessee and newspaper reports Nashville Airport video doesn't
[42:09.000 --> 42:15.080]  show I rate senator Rand Paul and they link to the video and there is Paul
[42:15.080 --> 42:19.360]  being completely calm with the police they're now also having to admit that
[42:19.360 --> 42:23.960]  he was attained for more than an hour and a half as he said he was which under
[42:23.960 --> 42:28.960]  common law is a custodial arrest so there you have it within minutes of this
[42:28.960 --> 42:32.800]  being put out by Ron Paul and his Twitter the New York Times talked to the
[42:32.800 --> 42:39.960]  TSA and said he wasn't even stopped for five minutes he's a liar and he was I
[42:39.960 --> 42:44.920]  rate and the police put in their report part of this culture of lying that he
[42:44.920 --> 42:52.040]  was I rate all lies by a group of people that lie and lie and lie some more and
[42:52.040 --> 42:58.160]  then of course lie some more and we have the White House shiding with the TSA we
[42:58.160 --> 43:03.480]  have Rush Limbaugh coming out and saying oh his dad's like a Muslim terrorist you
[43:03.480 --> 43:08.600]  know let's start the groping after all he flies on he flies on private jets but
[43:08.600 --> 43:15.520]  let's look at some of the TSA lies that affect us all radiation they've had
[43:15.520 --> 43:19.440]  studies back in the late 1990s from these same systems that's why they
[43:19.440 --> 43:22.120]  weren't deployed all over the world these things have been around for decades
[43:22.120 --> 43:26.160]  that they're massively linked to different types of cancer so John Hopkins
[43:26.160 --> 43:29.680]  and many other prestigious universities come out and put out reports the last
[43:29.680 --> 43:33.480]  few years saying our studies show this stuff can give you cancer I mean the
[43:33.480 --> 43:36.920]  scans are so powerful you can see the skeleton bones in the fingers I mean
[43:36.920 --> 43:42.120]  it's it's high-powered and all these studies come out so the TSA comes out
[43:42.120 --> 43:47.560]  and says Johns Hopkins says it's totally safe and the head of Johns Hopkins
[43:47.560 --> 43:51.960]  Radiology Department comes out and says our study actually says the opposite and
[43:51.960 --> 43:56.480]  the TSA doesn't correct their mistake because it's not a mistake they are a
[43:56.480 --> 44:01.200]  pack of criminal out of control tenth amendment violating and fourth
[44:01.200 --> 44:05.700]  amendment violating goons who are now setting up checkpoints on the highways
[44:05.700 --> 44:10.240]  of America and that's why the feds don't care how much anger or how many
[44:10.240 --> 44:14.640]  tens of billions in tourism the TSA destroys from foreigners that won't come
[44:14.640 --> 44:18.880]  here and Americans like myself that won't travel because I won't have my
[44:18.880 --> 44:22.920]  family groped because they're getting ready to be all over the United States
[44:22.920 --> 44:26.480]  they're gonna hire your local police that's been announced they're going to
[44:26.480 --> 44:31.160]  run checkpoints mobile vans it's already happening so you think you're just not
[44:31.160 --> 44:34.880]  gonna fly and get away with this oh sorry there's plenty of people that
[44:34.880 --> 44:39.680]  couldn't hold a job at McDonald's that are gonna be officer and agent TSA and
[44:39.680 --> 44:44.760]  your wife your wife's in deep trouble and your children they're in even deeper
[44:44.760 --> 44:48.680]  trouble psychologists have come out and pointed out that the TSA groping of
[44:48.680 --> 44:54.680]  children is actually training them that when pedophiles touch them to test and
[44:54.680 --> 44:58.440]  see if they've been acclimated for rape that they will submit to the touching
[44:58.440 --> 45:03.760]  and not say no and what's the TSA say they say we don't think that's the case
[45:03.760 --> 45:09.960]  and again a lot of the public and say everything's okay and claim despite the
[45:09.960 --> 45:13.600]  fact that there are hundreds of videos and photos showing them taking babies
[45:13.600 --> 45:18.440]  diapers off and going in the pants of small children they come out and say
[45:18.440 --> 45:23.600]  over and over again for three years we do not go in the clothes or even through
[45:23.600 --> 45:28.160]  the clothes and touch genitals of under 12 and then hundreds of videos come out
[45:28.160 --> 45:32.760]  and they say okay we're gonna stop last time they said that was in November of
[45:32.760 --> 45:39.160]  2010 and continued it over and over again and said again we won't do it
[45:39.160 --> 45:44.360]  continued it lying lying lying first they say it's not groping and sexual
[45:44.360 --> 45:49.240]  assault then they say they're not doing it then they say they're going to stop
[45:49.240 --> 45:54.640]  doing it and continue it over and over again lying about radiation lying about
[45:54.640 --> 45:59.160]  groping lying about the sexual assault lying about the statistics on how many
[45:59.160 --> 46:02.520]  of their people are caught engaged in every crime you can imagine but then you
[46:02.520 --> 46:06.880]  see bizarre statements on the TSA blog and in their press release is saying
[46:06.880 --> 46:12.040]  there's hardly any complaints why hardly anyone is against this and we only
[46:12.040 --> 46:17.240]  pat down 2% which is a total lie I fly all the time I'm forced to as a
[46:17.240 --> 46:22.240]  journalist I fly a lot my crew flies a lot and in hundreds of flights total
[46:22.240 --> 46:27.040]  we've estimated that at least a third of the people where we fly are groped
[46:27.040 --> 46:31.880]  including most people who are put through the naked body scanners so they're
[46:31.880 --> 46:35.080]  lying to you about radiation they're lying to you about groping and sexual
[46:35.080 --> 46:38.200]  assault they're lying and saying they're going to stop doing it to children or
[46:38.200 --> 46:41.560]  they say they never did it to children or they say they didn't go in the pants
[46:41.560 --> 46:47.080]  of Miss USA and then she goes and gets the video and they admit they did it but
[46:47.080 --> 46:52.720]  let's continue a few months ago a whole bunch of 85 and 90 year old women many of
[46:52.720 --> 46:55.840]  which couldn't even get out of their wheelchairs started reporting that they
[46:55.840 --> 46:59.960]  were taken behind closed doors and made to take all their clothes off and the TSA
[46:59.960 --> 47:05.040]  came out and said you're lying we don't do that and then so many people went
[47:05.040 --> 47:08.320]  public that they said well we do take you behind closed doors and take your
[47:08.320 --> 47:15.000]  clothes off we don't call it a strip search and then even in their apology the
[47:15.000 --> 47:19.000]  women who've been assaulted by them say it's all lies I mean it's lies within
[47:19.000 --> 47:24.080]  lies within lies within lies but what do you expect from a federal brown shirt
[47:24.080 --> 47:29.080]  goon force meant to dog train us and break our will to basically live like
[47:29.080 --> 47:33.920]  maximum security prisoners they're coming to malls highway checkpoints they're
[47:33.920 --> 47:37.720]  already there sporting games we're all being trained to have government put
[47:37.720 --> 47:42.040]  their hands on us and TSA is now training for forced inoculation federal
[47:42.040 --> 47:45.400]  grants to local police they're training of a force inoculation that's why
[47:45.400 --> 47:48.920]  they're doing this that's why they're they're lying to the American people
[47:48.920 --> 47:53.120]  because we're seen as an enemy and you lie to an enemy in warfare this is a
[47:53.120 --> 47:58.160]  foreign banking cartel occupying the United States and the TSA is their
[47:58.160 --> 48:02.960]  shock troops to bureaucratically go out there and train us to accept this in
[48:02.960 --> 48:06.840]  just the last week homeland security has come out and said we're not just about
[48:06.840 --> 48:10.520]  terror we're gonna hire your local police we're gonna certify who can get
[48:10.520 --> 48:14.280]  jobs anywhere we're gonna set up checkpoints in your town we're gonna
[48:14.280 --> 48:18.480]  have spies all over Twitter and Facebook we're gonna have citizen spies on the
[48:18.480 --> 48:23.560]  ground recording what you say politically they are recreating classical
[48:23.560 --> 48:30.720]  hardcore despotism this is 200 proof evil this is certified as bad as it
[48:30.720 --> 48:36.560]  gets it's conscious takeover oh and also they said that the machines could not
[48:36.560 --> 48:42.000]  physically hold images the machines are not set to store images they're not set
[48:42.000 --> 48:47.560]  to transmit images and then we got the manuals sent us by insiders that said
[48:47.560 --> 48:51.440]  that when they test the machines they look to see if they can see the genitals
[48:51.440 --> 48:56.320]  and that that is the marker they look for to make sure that the machine is
[48:56.320 --> 49:00.960]  tuned right and then indeed all the images are saved not just at airports
[49:00.960 --> 49:05.200]  but at courthouses and have been leaked and shared and they pin them up on the
[49:05.200 --> 49:08.360]  wall and when they see a good-looking woman it's come out they put them through
[49:08.360 --> 49:12.120]  them so they lied about saving the images there have been cases in England
[49:12.120 --> 49:16.760]  where they come up to famous film stars and asked them to sign scans of their
[49:16.760 --> 49:22.600]  own genitals this is really happening and of course it's a bunch of abusers
[49:22.600 --> 49:27.440]  that are willing to take these jobs remember that basic precept in law
[49:27.440 --> 49:31.320]  that if someone's been caught lying before don't believe anything they say
[49:31.320 --> 49:34.920]  and their criminals what do they say about the devil he's the father of
[49:34.920 --> 49:39.520]  lies but you believe in the devil or not this is a devilish attribute that we're
[49:39.520 --> 49:44.520]  seeing this is tyranny why do we just accept when government lies about
[49:44.520 --> 49:49.840]  Rand Paul and says that he was irate and wasn't detained both lies why do we not
[49:49.840 --> 49:54.760]  get upset about that why do we trust people that act like this the truth is
[49:54.760 --> 49:58.160]  more and more Americans are awake Congress has a 9% approval rating the
[49:58.160 --> 50:01.600]  system knows we're waking up to them so now they're taking the velvet glove off
[50:01.600 --> 50:06.720]  the iron fist and just going with the iron fist it is time to reawaken the
[50:06.720 --> 50:12.800]  spirit of 1776 it is time to recognize it is criminal when the TSA violates the
[50:12.800 --> 50:17.080]  10th to 9th Amendment operates in our states but it's even more criminal when
[50:17.080 --> 50:21.520]  they grow up our children our wives and our husbands and harass our old people
[50:21.520 --> 50:25.000]  and make cancer patients get out of wheelchairs that can't walk and make
[50:25.000 --> 50:29.320]  passengers help get them out of their chair this is a salt and it's criminal

[56:24.000 --> 56:28.560]  want to go hunting they're fishing of course to get up there I'd probably have
[56:28.560 --> 56:31.960]  to have a bunch of potbelly perverts grab my genitals and put me in a
[56:31.960 --> 56:35.720]  microwave oven and then act like I'm the crazy person for not liking it they
[56:35.720 --> 56:41.120]  might rob my bags you know I did have TSA robbed my bags flying back from New
[56:41.120 --> 56:51.400]  York what in 2005 one of my daughters was newborn been a couple months old and I
[56:51.400 --> 56:54.320]  thought well you know instead of a plastic rattle I'll go to Tiffany's

[57:01.560 --> 57:06.960]  they they unwrapped the little boxes from Tiffany's and then they just so I
[57:06.960 --> 57:12.640]  guess stole what they wanted and even put the note in there that they'd been in
[57:12.640 --> 57:18.080]  there but I'm supposed to like being robbed by the government I mean they do
[57:18.080 --> 57:22.280]  it anyways you know I can't tell you how crazy it is that I've talked to people

[57:29.440 --> 57:34.280]  nebulous so they can rob you and they'll call people in what's happened to my dad

[59:53.080 --> 01:00:00.920]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:12.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:20.000]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:37.720]  Alex Jones okay this is gonna be the first of a lot of interviews with an
[01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:42.400]  incredible researcher and of course a political prisoner he was a hundred
[01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:47.720]  percent set up and just a cartoonist fashion many years after quote the
[01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:51.920]  crimes were committed of robbing banks a guy who's a West Point grad no criminal
[01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:57.760]  record previous to that sent to prison and I know why they did it because when
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:01.320]  I first read bloodlines the Illuminati ten years ago when I first read some of
[01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:06.880]  his books I was still in a learning process and we all are continually I
[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:11.520]  was like you know what a lot of this can't be true now I knew a lot of it was
[01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:14.320]  true because I'd separately already researched it but some of it was just so
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:19.600]  outlandish and then over the years separately in my own research from
[01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:23.520]  even mainline sources I found other pieces that that was true I mean now
[01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:27.920]  it's even in major British newspapers that the royals still have their hind
[01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:33.680]  ends wiped that they eat body parts that they're related to Vlod the impaler
[01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:38.520]  they're really Transylvanian royalty not even German royalty and his book
[01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:42.600]  bloodlines the Illuminati of many books he's written is just so important and
[01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:46.840]  he's been out of jail now for about a year and is able to speak now and today
[01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:49.320]  I didn't even tell him really what I wanted him on about he's on but I'm
[01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:55.440]  sure getting him on every few weeks I want to get into the mindset of the
[01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:59.520]  highest level Illuminati and how their power structure is set up and some of
[01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:03.480]  the main families probably should have actually brought this up to him before he
[01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:07.400]  came on with us and then I would have about 30 minutes and then I want to open
[01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:11.800]  the phones up for Fritz Springmeyer today joining us via video Skype from his
[01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:16.880]  home in Portland, Oregon but the book bloodlines the Illuminati you know we
[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:19.400]  didn't have on the shopping cart for about a month because we sold out of it
[01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:23.320]  and because there it was on print demand we always had trouble getting enough of
[01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:28.120]  them I just went ahead and bellied up to the bar and helped Fritz print a couple
[01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:32.080]  thousand of these they're available right now at info wars.com we are the
[01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:36.560]  warehouser not as distributor we're just the warehouser of the books and we have

[01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:47.760]  in some of the books those will be available next week but bloodlines of
[01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:53.400]  the Illuminati available at info wars.com right now Fritz we're about to go
[01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:56.640]  to break and we're going to come back and recap all this but good to have you

[01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:14.280]  crystallizing the mindset the worldview the ultimate goal and who some of these
[01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:20.560]  top families are in the bloodlines sure we can do that when we come back from
[01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:26.600]  break I apologize yeah we're about to go to break and of course I know you've
[01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:29.760]  always got this info pretty much at your fingertips it's just that I probably
[01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:33.920]  should have relayed that to you earlier and and then you can recommend next time
[01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:36.840]  you come on what subjects you want to get into because I know you've written
[01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:46.800]  books on so many subjects how many books have you written well 19 and all and how
[01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:54.000]  many of them are in print right now very few thanks to your assistance we're
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:58.560]  able to make the bloodlines available and then there's about a half a dozen
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:03.120]  others that are available to people you know there's something in this book
[01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:09.960]  particularly that really made them angry at you take your pick there's
[01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:17.000]  there's plenty to for for them to get upset about and and we'll discuss some
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:24.320]  of that yeah well I'll be glad to talk about their mindset people naturally
[01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:29.440]  assume that someone who's controlling the world things like they do but these
[01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:35.480]  people do not think like you or I they have a totally different mindset and and
[01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:41.400]  they view us like you would an ant you know if you stepped on an ant as you're
[01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:45.440]  walking on the sidewalks you wouldn't even be concerned about it and and of
[01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:48.520]  course they say that about us how much they hate us how we're scum how we're
[01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:52.680]  filled they published little hate letters to humanity and the general public

[01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:39.960]  together dr. Stan Monteev says he has some breaking news concerning Iran it
[01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:42.360]  must be important because I've invited him on the show all the time but he
[01:08:42.360 --> 01:08:46.320]  rarely reaches out to us to come on and we just got Fritz Springmeyer on I've
[01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:49.840]  talked about the fact that I've gone over his case last time he was on no
[01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:56.440]  criminal record up to that point years after some banks get robbed he gets
[01:08:56.440 --> 01:09:01.160]  set up by known informants and sent to jail for bank robbery and of course he's
[01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:04.920]  pointed out it's a complete fraud and this is a guy who was speaking to packed
[01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:12.880]  halls that I saw on videos of thousands of people 19 books in print and right
[01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:16.240]  before they set him up I remember the year before he said yeah the cops broken
[01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:20.600]  my house looking for marijuana grow labs of course nothing was found yeah you
[01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:23.840]  know the local news was reporting that during the raid they found extremist
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:28.880]  material got a love that where they break in your house then talk about what's
[01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:32.360]  on your bookshelf as if you agree with everything on your bookshelf that you're
[01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:36.840]  reading but I've read mine comp doesn't mean I agree with Hitler I wanted to
[01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:41.840]  read what he said I've read a book by Julius Caesar to I'm not a I'm not a you
[01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:46.880]  know patrician class you know a supporter of the Roman city state I mean
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:51.360]  it's so ridiculous I've read Nietzsche doesn't mean I support all the ideas of
[01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:56.840]  Nietzsche I do think that which does not kill you only makes you stronger and
[01:09:56.840 --> 01:10:03.080]  stranger to kind of paraphrase Nietzsche and the Joker but then he was
[01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:06.040]  correcting me during the break just inside issue we actually have some of
[01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:09.560]  those photos you know that he went to West Point but then got out of it not a
[01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:13.080]  graduate of West Point because of what he saw is some of the mind control there
[01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:16.400]  he also I remember correctly even live with the Amish for a while to study that
[01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:20.960]  and he's had some amazing travels and things he saw I think it's best to start
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:27.520]  out a lot of people know who you are we're on XM we've gotten dozens of new
[01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:30.560]  affiliates more than a dozen just the last few weeks I need to mention some
[01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:35.160]  of those today so it's probably important you to introduce yourself to folks so
[01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:38.680]  they know who you are and then let's get into in this interview to what I
[01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:41.760]  mentioned in the first little short segment what is the mindset of the
[01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:45.560]  Illuminati what is their goal what is what are some of the top families and
[01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:49.840]  where are they taking our planet but Fritz and then and then while you're
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:52.720]  mentioning the West Point thing is I guess you sent this to my producers I
[01:10:52.720 --> 01:11:00.160]  wasn't aware of it photos of you at West Point doing military training it is
[01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:03.640]  some important point you want to make in general so we'll we'll raise those
[01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:08.200]  photos for prisonplanet.tv viewers and radio listeners whenever you're ready
[01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:14.760]  so Fritz you've got the floor go ahead well I people can go to my blog and
[01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:20.240]  read some about me that's one way of getting a little introduction another
[01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:26.120]  little introduction right here at the time is I'm a follower of Christ and
[01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:33.200]  that's what's important in my life it's not about me it's about Christ and yeah
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:39.480]  I have had a very unusual life where I was exposed to a lot of different things
[01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:46.680]  living overseas traveling overseas had a father who wanted to save the world by
[01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:53.520]  going to third world countries and developing their agriculture and like
[01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:59.240]  you said I went to West Point and and as you were saying there I was concerned
[01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:04.040]  about the things that I was seeing when I was in the military and I didn't feel
[01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:11.120]  comfortable being in the military with with the mindset that I saw around me so
[01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:17.960]  I resigned and some people thought it was a reaction to having been in the
[01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:23.920]  military that I turned around and joined the Amish but it wasn't it wasn't that it
[01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:29.960]  was that I was looking for something that was outside of the system and it's
[01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:36.800]  hard to find anything that's that wants to live a good life good clean life and
[01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:41.920]  that's not involved with the system and so I was outside of the system for a
[01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:48.040]  little while while I was Amish and then I felt called by God to come back and
[01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:54.040]  warn people about what was going on and so that's what I've been doing these
[01:12:54.040 --> 01:13:02.920]  these last few decades is is warning people just like yourself except last
[01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:09.920]  decade was spent mostly in a POW camp while you were out here continuing the
[01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:16.720]  good fight so that explains a little bit about myself but again like I say it's
[01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:22.920]  it's not about me it's about Christ and and then the truth of what I'm saying you
[01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:30.440]  know one of the things that they try to do to shut me up is they try to tarnish
[01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:37.080]  the reputation of the messenger and as you know you you've been out there you
[01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:42.000]  know how how people come out of the woodwork to say all kinds of crazy things
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:47.560]  about you it's not about me look at the truth of what I'm saying look at the
[01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:53.760]  documentation look research these things for yourself people and you'll start
[01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:58.400]  seeing it all makes sense and you'll start you'll start putting the pieces
[01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:03.800]  together for yourself I'm not asking you to take my word for it that's what I
[01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:06.760]  was saying earlier is that when I first read some of your books more than a
[01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:11.120]  decade ago a lot of it I could confirm because I've done separate research but
[01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:15.640]  some of it sounded so far out but over time I would separately even an
[01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:21.080]  establishment publications find large pieces that that added to it and now as
[01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:24.600]  my understanding has gotten deeper that's how the globalists see it we're
[01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:28.880]  asleep they're awake they are programming the subconscious and they're
[01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:34.200]  trying to create a totally fake false reality so they can deceive people and
[01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:39.520]  and that's what you were talking about decades ago so so so let's get into it
[01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:44.920]  crystallizing it for new listeners what is the Illuminati who are they who do
[01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:48.840]  they serve what do they want what makes them tick and then let's go over some of
[01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:55.600]  the families okay some people kind of cringe when they hear that word
[01:14:55.600 --> 01:15:00.840]  Illuminati like like this is a word that they really don't you know some
[01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:06.400]  conspiracy nut is using or something this is their own terminology when I
[01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:10.960]  started trying to help people that were trying to escape from the Illuminati
[01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:15.600]  members that had been teamed together that was their term for it that's the
[01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:20.600]  term that they normally use now in in rituals they may use terms like the
[01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:26.080]  family or the circle you know don't break the circle they may use other words
[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:31.560]  but the term Illuminati is the word that they use themselves and and its
[01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:37.760]  meaning is that they believe that they have been illumined to Godhood that
[01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:43.760]  they are gods and of course we're the little peons they're the pharaohs and
[01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:50.800]  we're the serfs and that's their mentality they're in a class above us
[01:15:50.800 --> 01:16:00.320]  we're more or less subhuman and their mentality a lot of what goes on is a
[01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:09.240]  consequence of of that view right there and and and they've had that view for
[01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:13.680]  for many thousands of years this isn't something that's just come about
[01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:20.360]  overnight they have a plan they this plan is an agenda and we've been in a
[01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:28.240]  great transition in recent years to to bring the entire world under the
[01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:34.000]  control of the beast computer which is linked to the internet so you'll notice
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:39.080]  that there's been an increasing by the way they really call it over in Europe
[01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:42.880]  they really call that particular computer system the worldwide beast and
[01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:47.680]  and it's a standardized global system in fact from Davos yesterday Homeland
[01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:51.440]  Security put out a press release and talks about the global centralized
[01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:56.600]  computer database to buy and sell that was in a press release yesterday sorry
[01:16:56.600 --> 01:17:07.120]  exactly so this this one world mind we're all becoming pulled into it the
[01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:12.800]  the computers that we have the PCs that the big ones that are on our desk those
[01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:16.280]  are going to be obsolete in a few years we're going to have these handheld
[01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:23.200]  devices in our hands that won't even need memory because storing memory is
[01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:28.800]  going to be redundant you're going to have these broadband such good broadband
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:34.600]  devices that you can tap into the world mind instantly but the globalist can
[01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:39.120]  then also erase whatever they want instantly and that brings total control
[01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:45.320]  exactly so we're all being sucked into this one world mind one global government
[01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:50.680]  we're all going to be like little adjuncts little fingers of of this beast
[01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:58.000]  and little cells of this beast we're just going to be as they used to say cogs in
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:04.720]  a machine you know and it's becoming increasingly that way but a lot of us
[01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:10.480]  are considered worthless eaters and so there's been a number of written
[01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:15.400]  agendas you know Henry Kissinger had one but there's many others where they
[01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:20.040]  have outlined on paper and sometimes publicly came out with these things
[01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:26.000]  where they want to get rid of a large share of us genocide so death is at the
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:34.360]  heart of their agenda boy that's true and you can look at it from several
[01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:37.760]  different directions you can say well these people the evil that they're
[01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:43.200]  doing would require them to to justify their actions by being Satanist or you
[01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:47.840]  could look at it the other way and say because they're Satanists there they
[01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:54.160]  have these agendas but either way you want to look at it their nasty philosophy
[01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:59.120]  that that is they don't see themselves as Satanist they they think Lucifer's
[01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:06.560]  God I think it's very beautiful yes they they have a lot of high-level rituals
[01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:13.080]  and very sophisticated rituals rituals that go back to antiquity they still
[01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:19.220]  carry out some of the same rituals that were done in ancient Egypt by the
[01:19:19.220 --> 01:19:28.920]  pharaohs rituals that go back to ancient Babylon the names that they give
[01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:33.280]  themselves their ritual names and everything go back to the ancient
[01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:38.400]  gods the ancient mystery religion intriguing intriguing we're coming back
[01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:42.000]  and I'm gonna attempt to sit back I want you to go through this you go through
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:46.920]  any of the gods the names and again more of who they are what they are where
[01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:50.280]  they want to take us how we can defeat them Fritz spring Myers our guest if you

[01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:19.240]  outages ahead here's why solar power generators are now available from our
[01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:23.400]  friends at solutions from science one of our oldest sponsors their emergency
[01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:27.120]  backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most
[01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:31.880]  unlike gas generators a solar generator runs quietly amidst no fumes and

[01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:59.080]  the short segment with the mindset you were getting into their rituals going
[01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:05.320]  back to Babylon back to Egypt okay great I'm gonna take this kind of in a
[01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:12.960]  direction that's going to answer several of the questions that you had we had a
[01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:19.240]  scandal that took place in Belgium the Dutro affair and and the the the
[01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:24.120]  Europeans discovered that the Belgium government was involved in satanic
[01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:29.720]  rituals and pedophilia this this all involves the mindset of the elite and
[01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:36.400]  the there was a humongous scandal about a hundred and ten people were
[01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:41.600]  assassinated to keep a lid on it now here in the United States we had the
[01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:47.240]  Kennedy assassination we had 9-11 those are entry points for people to learn
[01:25:47.240 --> 01:25:55.480]  that something's wrong but even closer to the heart of things was this Dutro
[01:25:55.480 --> 01:26:01.040]  affair where where they were where they actually discovered the satanic
[01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:05.560]  connection to all of this because a lot of people realize you know Wall Street
[01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:11.400]  has a lot of power these people the big mucky mucks they go to places like the
[01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:15.760]  Bohemian Grove but like when you were in the Bohemian Grove you notice that
[01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:20.560]  there's something else going on here you know it's not like these people are
[01:26:20.560 --> 01:26:26.160]  just atheists that don't don't have a religious side to them when you saw a
[01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:30.560]  cremation of care you're beginning to get a window that there's something more
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:36.560]  to these people right so the scandal exposed the satanic side of this and
[01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:43.960]  how the governments in Europe were protecting this huge network of child
[01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:50.920]  slavery and child prostitution they would have pink ballades in this castle
[01:26:50.920 --> 01:26:55.600]  that I exposed and so the book that you've been been presenting to people
[01:26:55.600 --> 01:27:01.840]  bloodlines of Illuminati that came out in 95 it was the first place where the
[01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:08.560]  public got a real good look at that mother of darkness castle that's like a
[01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:12.720]  headquarters for the the female branch of the Illuminati that's where the
[01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:20.680]  grand Danes like Bill Clinton's lower than Hillary Clinton in the Illuminati
[01:27:20.680 --> 01:27:27.400]  Hillary Clinton becoming a grand name that means that she would travel to this
[01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:35.440]  castle and do rituals and the castle was also used for murdering children in
[01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:42.920]  in in they have rituals there and by the way this is the reason they came after
[01:27:42.920 --> 01:27:48.440]  you so much and and separately it's now come out in the news that Hillary does
[01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:53.480]  weird rituals same thing with Tony Blair François Mitterrand admitted does
[01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:59.240]  worship Lucifer had that pyramid at the Louvre built with 666 pieces of pink
[01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:04.960]  glass Tony Blair reportedly this is mainstream British news flops around
[01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:09.840]  and is possessed by the spirit of light every morning flopping around and goes
[01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:16.440]  to sacred sites worldwide I mean these are complete lunatics yes this is the
[01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:22.600]  hidden side of it all we see the nice good front where the press shows these
[01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:29.040]  people as in their their suits and ties and looking intelligent and lies but then
[01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:33.880]  there's this ritual side this hidden ritual side of them and like if you're
[01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:38.560]  someone like Hillary and you're going to this the Chateau de Amaro and I don't
[01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:42.720]  speak French so I probably butchered the name there but it's a castle that I
[01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:48.680]  exposed I found out about the castle in 1991 when I was working with people that
[01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:53.400]  were trying to get out of the Illuminati these were were people that had done
[01:28:53.400 --> 01:28:58.160]  rituals in the castle and knew about it by the way let me stop again I didn't
[01:28:58.160 --> 01:29:02.280]  believe your book when I first read it and then the Sunday Times of London came
[01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:06.960]  out with a separate castle in Burgundy where all these women escaped and the
[01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:10.640]  cops got there and there were a bunch of dead women and women in cages and it
[01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:14.600]  turned out it went to the top leaders of France so the whole thing got shut down
[01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:19.440]  but this actually came out in the news after I'd read your book years later I
[01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:25.520]  saw the same stuff exactly I mean folks and I'm like oh Fritz
[01:29:25.520 --> 01:29:30.320]  Springmeyer this goes too far and then and then I see it in the news it's just
[01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:34.920]  God help us stay stay right there Fritz Springmeyer is our guest and I got those
[01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:38.360]  congressional hearings where they're asking Rumsfeld well Dinkor runs these
[01:29:38.360 --> 01:29:42.920]  child kidnapping rings are you gonna do anything about that he goes no they were
[01:29:42.920 --> 01:29:46.160]  given a one-year penalty on these contracts in that area of Europe well
[01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:50.800]  no one goes to jail and he goes no I mean folks oh man I tell you we're on the

[01:32:03.120 --> 01:32:07.400]  buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[01:32:07.400 --> 01:32:11.600]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:15.480]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[01:32:15.480 --> 01:32:19.160]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[01:32:19.160 --> 01:32:23.720]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:27.760]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[01:32:27.760 --> 01:32:31.560]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:35.160]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[01:32:35.160 --> 01:32:39.520]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[01:33:55.040 --> 01:34:05.600]  from you questions for Fritz Springmeyer 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 okay going
[01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:09.840]  back to the author of bloodlines of the Illuminati an incredible book and it's
[01:34:09.840 --> 01:34:14.840]  Dallas phone book size full of documents and photos you're not gonna be able to
[01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:20.120]  put this book down Fritz continuing from that point you've gotten to that being in
[01:34:20.120 --> 01:34:24.720]  the European press the satanic rituals the police the judges the the the
[01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:28.360]  report of the royal family they're always finding dead bodies they just found
[01:34:28.360 --> 01:34:32.720]  a new dead teenager on Queen Elizabeth's property right by our house the other day
[01:34:32.720 --> 01:34:43.480]  it's just a routine thing but please continue yes earlier you ask about some
[01:34:43.480 --> 01:34:49.440]  of the names of of their gods within the women's branch we were talking about
[01:34:49.440 --> 01:34:57.080]  the mother of darkness castle there near moon row Belgium and the kind of
[01:34:57.080 --> 01:35:01.240]  rituals that will go on there there will be hierarchy rituals these are high
[01:35:01.240 --> 01:35:10.000]  level rituals and these Illuminati members are programmed multiples they're
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:14.680]  multiple personalities so they have personalities that take part in the
[01:35:14.680 --> 01:35:20.480]  rituals one like for the women there's a triad goddess system where it's a
[01:35:20.480 --> 01:35:27.080]  mother it where it's maiden mother and crone and a lot of these things actually
[01:35:27.080 --> 01:35:31.960]  are around us and we don't even realize it like one of the crone figures
[01:35:31.960 --> 01:35:38.200]  cali another one of her names is caledonia another crone that's related to
[01:35:38.200 --> 01:35:45.000]  calic is cali and california california sea hag california is the sea hag it's
[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:49.200]  all about gods and goddesses and just like eulogia at skull and bones it's
[01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:54.280]  admitted they worship eulogia there which is a hag but I mean let's continue to
[01:35:54.280 --> 01:35:58.040]  break this down it's just incredible you're saying this it sounds wild but
[01:35:58.040 --> 01:36:04.600]  it's all right there if you've done the research yes and it's once you start
[01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:10.800]  realizing that there's this whole substratta around us that of this
[01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:15.200]  occult world there's a cult symbology all around us and they're not just
[01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:21.640]  programming us animal psychology Pavlovian psychology this isn't new it's just a
[01:36:21.640 --> 01:36:27.000]  modern packaging they themselves come from a programming cult that's what
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:31.160]  these rituals are ancients learned mind control that's why every ancient
[01:36:31.160 --> 01:36:36.320]  society tortured had human sacrifice made the king sometimes kill his own kids
[01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:40.600]  it's all about the priest class totally dominating continue with the women and
[01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:46.640]  then the men but who's at the head of it continue well within the women's branch
[01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:55.920]  the they have grandain and that's a that's the final level yeah you have
[01:36:55.920 --> 01:37:01.720]  these families and there's five inner families and then there's 13 top families
[01:37:01.720 --> 01:37:11.400]  and then in the in the next ring you have like 500 inner families and it's
[01:37:11.400 --> 01:37:15.640]  like peeling back an onion there's you know you've got the inner core that
[01:37:15.640 --> 01:37:21.440]  works through the next level next level next level and so you have all of these
[01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:29.840]  rituals all these committees councils of 13 is a Sanhedrin of 70 you've got so
[01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:34.520]  many different organizations and one thing notice the Super Congress is 12
[01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:38.760]  members of the Congress and the president the 13th again always
[01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:45.200]  counterfeiting Christ yeah they they enjoy that number 13 for these councils
[01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:54.840]  so let's see where you were getting into the different you were talking about
[01:37:54.840 --> 01:38:03.080]  the Sanhedrin yeah I was I was discussing how there's there's not one
[01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:11.520]  person is running the show you know like we would we would think because what
[01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:17.360]  happens is is you're born into this and you're as somebody who's been born in
[01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:22.600]  even if you rise to the top and even if you have a lot of power you're still
[01:38:22.600 --> 01:38:28.880]  signing on to the plan the plan was created you know it's a group thing
[01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:35.200]  it's it's and and it's something that's been going on for a long time so they
[01:38:35.200 --> 01:38:41.440]  have long-range plans so these agendas are just snap decisions the the idea
[01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:47.080]  that they were there would be a third world war has been around for for over
[01:38:47.080 --> 01:38:51.000]  200 years all the top mason's and eliminated people like wise hop wrote
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:56.560]  books about it as you know in 1770s they've been described the three wars
[01:38:56.560 --> 01:39:05.800]  yeah yeah so we're so so these things are our 10 year plans 30 year plans 50
[01:39:05.800 --> 01:39:09.720]  year plans hundred year but they have these long-range plans and then they
[01:39:09.720 --> 01:39:16.320]  have these systems to bring them about going back to how the control filters
[01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:29.600]  down they've divided life into six major areas they take what God uses to
[01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:36.480]  sustain the world truth love and and things like this and there's a twisting
[01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:41.360]  of those things and they make a system out of it so therefore you end up with
[01:39:41.360 --> 01:39:46.560]  the health care system the political system the financial system like Wall
[01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:52.000]  Street the banking system you have a system of control and and so to get
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:40:01.160]  these necessities of life that we we feel we need we end up linking ourselves to
[01:40:01.160 --> 01:40:06.120]  these powerful controlling system it's about overthrowing creation becoming
[01:40:06.120 --> 01:40:10.800]  God taking things over so we have to go to them as if they're God and we're born
[01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:17.080]  into a giant lie not just mind control but a physical lie that's how they try
[01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:22.920]  to take free will away exactly you said it better than I did no I didn't know
[01:40:22.920 --> 01:40:29.760]  you're absolutely right to continue on this line well said that's it that's
[01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:36.040]  exactly and and so from the time we're born we're born into this system and it
[01:40:36.040 --> 01:40:42.080]  systematically controls us and steals our freedom and all the while telling us
[01:40:42.080 --> 01:40:47.760]  oh you're free you this or that you're making the decisions you know yeah like
[01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:52.000]  like the American people how often have I heard heard people say well you
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:55.800]  shouldn't you shouldn't complain about your president because we were the ones
[01:40:55.800 --> 01:41:05.280]  that elected him no no no people you didn't elect that president they select
[01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:09.720]  who you can then pick from and then even that's a fraud that's why Ron Paul is
[01:41:09.720 --> 01:41:13.280]  kind of showing that it's all theater because he is one of the only real
[01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:17.600]  people to come along in a very long time and we see the system together acting as
[01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:22.360]  one to ignore him to lie about him to spin I think this is really revealed to
[01:41:22.360 --> 01:41:28.400]  people just how lockstep the corporate horror media is but in that as well why
[01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:33.120]  is the system losing a lot of power right now Fritz from my research their
[01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:39.120]  system is not right as they get close to getting everything they've wanted right
[01:41:39.120 --> 01:41:42.840]  here at the end right at the jump point where they're supposed to go from
[01:41:42.840 --> 01:41:46.440]  incremental to fast things are not going well things are getting out of
[01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:53.000]  control for them do you agree with that assessment yeah there has been some
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:59.680]  rubber band effect is is the term we used to use that is people in power when
[01:41:59.680 --> 01:42:04.920]  they give a command there's a big rubber band effective when it gets what the
[01:42:04.920 --> 01:42:09.160]  command gets stretched to something else by the time it reaches the the bottom
[01:42:09.160 --> 01:42:15.040]  tier yeah things have gotten sloppy for them but they're they're working on
[01:42:15.040 --> 01:42:22.120]  tightening things up so in the next few years they'll they're gonna implement
[01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:26.360]  some plans to tighten things up and we see that they're coming out saying we'll
[01:42:26.360 --> 01:42:30.000]  secretly arrest you we're shutting down free speech and you bet we're putting
[01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:35.760]  stuff in your shots and we're gonna force you to take them yeah so there'll
[01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:41.120]  be a whole range of things and one thing that they're concerned about
[01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:46.920]  especially with Americans is Americans have too much freedom too much money
[01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:53.520]  too much mobility and so you're going to see United States humbled and I'm gonna
[01:42:53.520 --> 01:42:57.040]  stop you again Jim Tucker who has been proven to have sources in Bilderberg
[01:42:57.040 --> 01:43:01.260]  I've got some sub sources that have sources in Bilderberg all they talk
[01:43:01.260 --> 01:43:04.280]  about is how we've got too much money and how they're gonna make us
[01:43:04.280 --> 01:43:08.600]  financially bankrupt and how much they hate Liberty movement and Ron Paul and
[01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:13.880]  myself and others I've been brought up I mean they really cannot stand it and
[01:43:13.880 --> 01:43:18.360]  they want to use impoverishment as a tool of control and a post-industrial fake
[01:43:18.360 --> 01:43:22.000]  environmental movement but even that's in trouble but people need to understand
[01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:26.480]  I mean they they what you're saying Fritz is so accurate but but you're
[01:43:26.480 --> 01:43:30.240]  saying it from inside sources that you got instead of just learning it I mean
[01:43:30.240 --> 01:43:33.880]  I know you did as well separately out there just kind of you know from the
[01:43:33.880 --> 01:43:37.880]  bottom up you happened to bump right into people that had actually been in it
[01:43:37.880 --> 01:43:43.960]  and I think that's why they got so scared of you and came after you yeah I'm sure
[01:43:43.960 --> 01:43:52.080]  there are multiple reasons as to why I ticked people off so it's hard to put
[01:43:52.080 --> 01:43:57.120]  your finger on just one reason but yeah you kind of lumped it up they lumped it
[01:43:57.120 --> 01:44:07.680]  together there exactly and two things that the insiders talked to me about
[01:44:07.680 --> 01:44:16.800]  that opened my eyes up a lot that we've discussed today was is bloodlines are
[01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:20.400]  important to these people they keep track of their genealogies
[01:44:20.400 --> 01:44:27.760]  facetiously and also control mind control mind control is extremely
[01:44:27.760 --> 01:44:35.600]  important to them and and so that's why I wrote several books on the mind
[01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:42.480]  control and it's why I wrote the bloodlines book it's not a casual topic
[01:44:42.480 --> 01:44:47.800]  with them it's very important and you'll notice like the Rothschilds which is one
[01:44:47.800 --> 01:44:55.640]  of the inner five families back in 1826 I believe it was it became there was a
[01:44:55.640 --> 01:45:00.000]  newspaper article that came out how the family had organized a meeting of all
[01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:04.640]  the heads of the family and taken a stand in the family meeting that they
[01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:10.440]  would only marry within the family well that's that's rather common within the
[01:45:10.440 --> 01:45:20.000]  Illuminati is they they try to marry within their bloodline and right there
[01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:24.840]  is a scientific reason why royalty elites are always so macabre and
[01:45:24.840 --> 01:45:30.080]  psychopathic every mammal species that interbreeds becomes insane vicious
[01:45:30.080 --> 01:45:35.400]  psychopathic unstable unsocial so right there even if somebody isn't into
[01:45:35.400 --> 01:45:41.160]  spiritualism or Christian or whatever scientifically these are inbred crazy
[01:45:41.160 --> 01:45:53.440]  people so and and they're doing it intentionally and they have brought in
[01:45:53.440 --> 01:46:02.240]  some outside blood but but basically generally they're they're pretty the
[01:46:02.240 --> 01:46:06.720]  bloodlines are pretty pure as far as being Illuminati blood and there's some
[01:46:06.720 --> 01:46:15.800]  reasons for that too they pass on generational curses they pass on okay
[01:46:15.800 --> 01:46:21.800]  are we losing connection here no I can hear you can you hear me okay fine it
[01:46:21.800 --> 01:46:24.800]  was it started break breaking up a little bit but keep going you're saying
[01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:32.800]  they pass on curses yeah they for the mind control they need people that are
[01:46:32.800 --> 01:46:38.680]  genetically able to dissociate and become program multiple personalities and
[01:46:38.680 --> 01:46:43.800]  most people are not able to do that if you torture most little children they'll
[01:46:43.800 --> 01:46:51.160]  they'll just curl up and die it takes a special select breed of people that that
[01:46:51.160 --> 01:46:56.040]  as children when they're tortured are creative enough to become multiple
[01:46:56.040 --> 01:47:03.000]  personalities not everybody's able to do that and but their bloodlines have good
[01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:09.880]  disassociative abilities and this is something that they've developed over
[01:47:09.880 --> 01:47:17.440]  thousands of years so yeah they they they're they're not like us and that's
[01:47:17.440 --> 01:47:22.280]  one of the things I might emphasize to the listeners because so often times I
[01:47:22.280 --> 01:47:29.920]  hear people trying to extrapolate what these leaders must be thinking and they
[01:47:29.920 --> 01:47:36.960]  place their own thinking upon them it doesn't work that way it's just like
[01:47:36.960 --> 01:47:42.880]  trying to figure out how a bureaucrat is going to make a decision they don't
[01:47:42.880 --> 01:47:47.560]  think like a rational logical person they have their own bureaucratic logic which
[01:47:47.560 --> 01:47:55.040]  doesn't make any sense to any rational person you know it's usually about the
[01:47:55.040 --> 01:48:06.820]  raw exercise of power yeah but when when you think through what you would say
[01:48:06.820 --> 01:48:10.720]  well what they want to accomplish is this this and this why would they do
[01:48:10.720 --> 01:48:16.800]  that and it would seem like it would be counterproductive there's a lot of a lot
[01:48:16.800 --> 01:48:24.000]  of subplots within subplots within subplots and they create conflict
[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:28.440]  because the way they like to work is through controlled conflict so just
[01:48:28.440 --> 01:48:34.800]  because maybe one Illuminati family is trying to take care of another Illuminati
[01:48:34.800 --> 01:48:39.320]  family like you see on NASA's was working against the Kennedy's you know
[01:48:39.320 --> 01:48:44.400]  that the Kennedy the Kennedy brothers and or NASA's hated each other but that
[01:48:44.400 --> 01:48:47.640]  doesn't mean that they're not on the same team it means that's the way the
[01:48:47.640 --> 01:48:51.720]  Illuminati work they like to stab each other in the backs thinking that that's
[01:48:51.720 --> 01:48:57.760]  the way you get the best the the best person's going to rise to the top through
[01:48:57.760 --> 01:49:01.680]  all this yeah they see it as social Darwinism it's just incredible the book
[01:49:01.680 --> 01:49:06.000]  breaks down so much of it bloodlines that Illuminati Fritz Springmeyer Fritz
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:09.680]  right now let's look at our books because we're going to come back into one
[01:49:09.680 --> 01:49:13.640]  segment and one more segment before you've got to leave us I want to get
[01:49:13.640 --> 01:49:18.640]  you back up next week for a full hour or maybe even two to really get into all
[01:49:18.640 --> 01:49:22.120]  this you can send us some slides if you want for people that are watching on the
[01:49:22.120 --> 01:49:25.480]  internet not just listening on the radio as we can actually show some of what
[01:49:25.480 --> 01:49:28.760]  you're talking about here on air and kind of go through this in more detail
[01:49:28.760 --> 01:49:32.800]  because this is riveting and I don't want to go to break I don't even want to
[01:49:32.800 --> 01:49:35.840]  come back and take calls but they'll bring up great points I want to keep
[01:49:35.840 --> 01:49:39.880]  hearing you bring up more because as crazy as this all sounds truth is
[01:49:39.880 --> 01:49:44.240]  stranger than fiction every time you're talking about something there because
[01:49:44.240 --> 01:49:47.560]  I've done so much research on my own it's like bing bing bing bing bing bing bing
[01:49:47.560 --> 01:49:52.400]  all this proof that what you're saying is so incredibly accurate and that's why
[01:49:52.400 --> 01:49:55.320]  they've come after you because you're hitting the nail on the head these
[01:49:55.320 --> 01:50:01.960]  people are basically a ruling elite of mentally ill crazy people who are who
[01:50:01.960 --> 01:50:06.160]  are who are so anti-human that they're able to take over because they're like
[01:50:06.160 --> 01:50:10.840]  cancer they're malfunctioning and they're the inmates are running the
[01:50:10.840 --> 01:50:17.280]  asylum and they're highly intelligent genius level psychopathic control freak
[01:50:17.280 --> 01:50:26.280]  sadist who who are just not what regular people are they are the dark side

[01:54:23.360 --> 01:54:28.440]  born into the occult it's bizarre but if you've done your research or you're a
[01:54:28.440 --> 01:54:33.360]  news hound it just keeps popping up and the Illuminati is real these people are
[01:54:33.360 --> 01:54:36.520]  into it I've got letters that George Washington wrote talking about the
[01:54:36.520 --> 01:54:43.040]  Illuminati trying to take over the Masons this stuff is going on and the
[01:54:43.040 --> 01:54:46.880]  book bloodlines the Illuminati exposes it we're working on getting fritz on both
[01:54:46.880 --> 01:54:52.200]  the nightly news next week and we think Thursday tentative for two hours noon to
[01:54:52.200 --> 01:54:56.680]  two so we can have him talk for an hour I'll just shove a sock in my mouth and
[01:54:56.680 --> 01:55:00.440]  then an hour of phone calls but let's go to calls right now for the next little
[01:55:00.440 --> 01:55:04.040]  segment try to get all five of these callers Carl Ronnie Tommy Chris and
[01:55:04.040 --> 01:55:09.600]  Gary Gary's in Hong Kong so we'll go to Gary in Hong Kong first Gary your
[01:55:09.600 --> 01:55:16.520]  question for Fritz Springmeyer hello yes sir oh I'm a first-time caller but
[01:55:16.520 --> 01:55:21.960]  long-time listener I've been a Mason for 30 years and I stopped paying my dues
[01:55:21.960 --> 01:55:27.280]  because I have Cherokees in my family and a tribal Lakota elder sent me a
[01:55:27.280 --> 01:55:31.120]  video from Mount Pleasant boarding school and you know there's a murder and
[01:55:31.120 --> 01:55:35.480]  torture that went on in those boarding schools and what happened was the
[01:55:35.480 --> 01:55:38.880]  cornerstone I saw in the video the cornerstone was laid by Freemasons and
[01:55:38.880 --> 01:55:43.160]  that sort of did it for me right there well I mean overall most Freemasons are
[01:55:43.160 --> 01:55:46.440]  compartmentalized like every other big organization and think they're doing good
[01:55:46.440 --> 01:55:50.320]  I've had a lot of ancestors that were Masons a lot of the founders were but
[01:55:50.320 --> 01:55:56.680]  the system uses that any secret society they will grow within it basically
[01:55:56.680 --> 01:56:00.480]  because if you go back it goes back to Solomon's temple and before so it goes
[01:56:00.480 --> 01:56:06.200]  back into antiquity and you've had these you know these mystery schools that go
[01:56:06.200 --> 01:56:10.560]  right back to Egypt not just Babylon but do you have a question for Fritz
[01:56:10.560 --> 01:56:14.960]  Springmeyer no I just wanted to make a comment and give you and Mark Dyson
[01:56:14.960 --> 01:56:18.400]  Fritz an apology because I was in denial for a long time and I didn't believe it
[01:56:18.400 --> 01:56:22.080]  first but now I'm so sorry you know well that's like saying you know the
[01:56:22.080 --> 01:56:25.360]  government deals the drugs and people say well are you saying a cop on the
[01:56:25.360 --> 01:56:30.600]  beat stealing drugs no not on average it's at the top they certainly are but
[01:56:30.600 --> 01:56:35.720]  but God bless you and I appreciate your call briefly I mean how does modern
[01:56:35.720 --> 01:56:41.480]  Masonry especially tie into all this Fritz well I like to call it the glove
[01:56:41.480 --> 01:56:45.440]  that fits on to the hand of the Illuminati you said it very well they're
[01:56:45.440 --> 01:56:51.040]  used and a lot of people are unwittingly used they don't see the bigger picture
[01:56:51.040 --> 01:56:55.680]  for some reason they just they just blindly go along and think they're in a
[01:56:55.680 --> 01:57:01.000]  good old boys club there's clues all around them as to what's going on but
[01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:07.440]  like so many people they they they're not really analyzing what they're doing or
[01:57:07.440 --> 01:57:13.840]  what they're involved with so you said you said it pretty well is that you know
[01:57:13.840 --> 01:57:21.000]  you have a mixture some people are have their eyes open and realize what's what
[01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:24.760]  the bigger picture is and some people just participate and just blindly
[01:57:24.760 --> 01:57:30.160]  continue to support something that's working for for the elite yeah let's
[01:57:30.160 --> 01:57:33.920]  jam another call here I see a call on the board called anti Christ but we got
[01:57:33.920 --> 01:57:38.760]  to go in order here Carl in Oregon you're on the air welcome good afternoon
[01:57:38.760 --> 01:57:43.680]  cover commander miss talking to you on Sunday saw a movie called age of those
[01:57:43.680 --> 01:57:50.160]  called Aquarius age of evil a Keith Thompson movie and it did mention
[01:57:50.160 --> 01:57:54.040]  Pittsburgh of spring mire and his story a friend of mine told me that he was
[01:57:54.040 --> 01:57:57.160]  gonna be on the radio soon so I do have a couple questions for him originally

[01:58:17.680 --> 01:58:21.760]  was about that the the best truth movement that's not been co-opted to get
[01:58:21.760 --> 01:58:25.320]  into okay so so basically the globalists want to turn us into these
[01:58:25.320 --> 01:58:28.920]  biological androids they're announcing all these microchips to cure all these
[01:58:28.920 --> 01:58:32.960]  things but what is the Trojan horse that's in them so we'll get that answer

[02:00:38.600 --> 02:00:42.640]  truth movement you know group organization out there to be part of in
[02:00:42.640 --> 02:00:50.920]  your view Fritz and then his comment about biological androids go ahead I'm
[02:00:50.920 --> 02:00:57.400]  gonna pass on recommending anything I mean you've got a tremendous program here
[02:00:57.400 --> 02:01:06.760]  for people to watch and you're you know it's all about them becoming empowered
[02:01:06.760 --> 02:01:11.080]  I mean I'm not saying organizations are bad but that's where things always get
[02:01:11.080 --> 02:01:15.080]  weird it's just I mean I'm I don't even have an organization it's just we're
[02:01:15.080 --> 02:01:23.920]  independent we love freedom exactly I've seen some groups that are actually
[02:01:23.920 --> 02:01:28.800]  managing to get the right idea where they don't want anybody to be the leader
[02:01:28.800 --> 02:01:34.320]  where they want to empower everybody that was sort of the idea behind that
[02:01:34.320 --> 02:01:38.720]  Occupy Wall Street movement but then I heard a lot of people complaining well
[02:01:38.720 --> 02:01:43.360]  there's not one spokesman one leader well that's the mindset that people have
[02:01:43.360 --> 02:01:49.200]  is that is they want things to be controlled they don't you know but we
[02:01:49.200 --> 02:01:55.840]  need to empower people not control them as far as the Android thing we see this
[02:01:55.840 --> 02:02:01.160]  progression first it started out a number of years ago with people being
[02:02:01.160 --> 02:02:06.080]  implanted and then these implants and a few of the people that I worked with
[02:02:06.080 --> 02:02:12.000]  actually managed to get the implants or get them out of them but these implants
[02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:18.040]  were were being controlled by AI artificial intelligence generally although
[02:02:18.040 --> 02:02:22.400]  sometimes they would be manipulated by human handlers they were just they were
[02:02:22.400 --> 02:02:28.240]  being used for weird things but you have something called BCI brain computer
[02:02:28.240 --> 02:02:34.640]  interface and we're gonna can we're gonna see a gradual progression of more
[02:02:34.640 --> 02:02:41.440]  BCI as they integrate already got the drones that that are autonomous flying
[02:02:41.440 --> 02:02:48.320]  around killing people oh yes and we're gonna see an increasing progression of
[02:02:48.320 --> 02:02:55.400]  this as they link us back in to that internet system that beast brain they're
[02:02:55.400 --> 02:03:00.280]  linking us they're tying us all back in there the web is getting stronger and
[02:03:00.280 --> 02:03:05.680]  stronger yeah let's go to another call here at Tommy I in Tennessee you're on
[02:03:05.680 --> 02:03:11.200]  the air with Fritz spring mark go ahead sir hey Alex how you doing good I gotta
[02:03:11.200 --> 02:03:15.320]  help you out with this media name I believe I got it the word has its
[02:03:15.320 --> 02:03:20.280]  origins in Greek theater describing a character who wore a mask normally
[02:03:20.280 --> 02:03:25.000]  describing an unregenerate person who was self-deceived they have received a
[02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:31.400]  reward the reward is they were seen by me and nothing more it's hypocrite how
[02:03:31.400 --> 02:03:35.600]  about the hip-hop media that's that's a good idea I appreciate your call
[02:03:35.600 --> 02:03:41.120]  Fritz what is a good name for the prostitute decepticon of sewer stream
[02:03:41.120 --> 02:03:47.000]  trader stream media just you know elite brainwashing media globalist media what
[02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:53.520]  would you call the mainstream media what really describes them boy you you have
[02:03:53.520 --> 02:04:00.000]  some great language there it's it's all a great show this one grandmaster in
[02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:05.600]  the Illuminati he said it's all just theater for the masses it's just a big
[02:04:05.600 --> 02:04:14.120]  show that they put on and maybe you said it very well you know it it's and then
[02:04:14.120 --> 02:04:18.080]  they tell us that they print all the news that's fit to here well apparently all
[02:04:18.080 --> 02:04:22.840]  the news that's fit for them to give us that's a very arrogant statement hidden
[02:04:22.840 --> 02:04:27.760]  in plain view right there I mean really it is the theater the fiction media the
[02:04:27.760 --> 02:04:32.200]  the mainstream media is even when it's real stuff they're talking about they
[02:04:32.200 --> 02:04:36.480]  always put some spin on it and I always wonder why they lie even when it's the
[02:04:36.480 --> 02:04:41.120]  truth would suit them because they they want everything just to be false it's
[02:04:41.120 --> 02:04:44.520]  just part of what they do I know we got a bunch of other callers folks you can
[02:04:44.520 --> 02:04:47.880]  stay on and talk to Bob Chapman if you want and others but Fritz has got to go

[02:05:20.840 --> 02:05:26.200]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for

[02:08:40.840 --> 02:08:48.640]  news at info wars news dot com and prison planet dot TV we have a big
[02:08:48.640 --> 02:08:53.120]  article investigative report up at info wars dot com that is so important to get
[02:08:53.120 --> 02:09:01.400]  out to everyone you know FEMA camps and rendition hubs discovered and it's by
[02:09:01.400 --> 02:09:06.640]  Kurt Nemo and has a video report I compiled with Rob do and what's crazy
[02:09:06.640 --> 02:09:09.880]  here is there's all these links the admissions of the torture flights out
[02:09:09.880 --> 02:09:13.520]  of the U.S. that citizens are being grabbed that the government says they
[02:09:13.520 --> 02:09:19.080]  can kill citizens not just torture admitting the rec 84 admitting the
[02:09:19.080 --> 02:09:24.840]  FEMA camps admitting all the facets of it but still it's a conspiracy theory
[02:09:24.840 --> 02:09:31.280]  to say this is going on that's like when Rand Paul got it held for almost two
[02:09:31.280 --> 02:09:36.080]  hours they just said no you weren't held for that and no when we hold you by
[02:09:36.080 --> 02:09:41.240]  force you're not detained and you're a conspiracy theorist I've actually seen
[02:09:41.240 --> 02:09:45.120]  that in the news they're calling drudge a conspiracy theorist for linking to
[02:09:45.120 --> 02:09:50.120]  articles and videos of Newt Gennrich admitting he's for open borders and
[02:09:50.120 --> 02:09:58.760]  carbon taxes the New York Times calls it a conspiracy theory they call a
[02:09:58.760 --> 02:10:04.520]  conspiratorial dumping of twisted and manipulative negative attacks again if
[02:10:04.520 --> 02:10:07.200]  you catch a guy come out of your house with your television set you're like
[02:10:07.200 --> 02:10:10.040]  you're robbing my house they're like you're a conspiracy theorist I think
[02:10:10.040 --> 02:10:15.120]  the average American might go oh yes sir take it take it and by the way you
[02:10:15.120 --> 02:10:18.480]  know I'm gonna break your nose you're like you broke my nose this conspiracy
[02:10:18.480 --> 02:10:22.120]  theory oh I'm not bleeding you're right here's a ball peen hammer in the head
[02:10:22.120 --> 02:10:26.840]  yeah you know actually kill you and your wife walks up you just killed my
[02:10:26.840 --> 02:10:29.920]  husband with a hammer conspiracy theory it's like a trance word the person goes
[02:10:29.920 --> 02:10:34.920]  you're right you're right yeah I'm not even doing this show it doesn't even
[02:10:34.920 --> 02:10:39.240]  exist as a consp... that in fact I told Carnival I guess that owns that
[02:10:39.240 --> 02:10:45.360]  subcompany that had the ship that wrecked into the rocks there you know
[02:10:45.360 --> 02:10:47.960]  they've been acting like they didn't do anything wrong and the captain's been
[02:10:47.960 --> 02:10:52.040]  like well I was a couple miles off course for no reason I feel like it and
[02:10:52.040 --> 02:10:56.080]  you know I'm sure I got in the lifeboat and ordered dinner in the lifeboat and
[02:10:56.080 --> 02:11:00.360]  everything's fine you I did nothing wrong I just told the company just say
[02:11:00.360 --> 02:11:04.480]  it's a conspiracy theory just say the Mediterranean doesn't exist Italy doesn't
[02:11:04.480 --> 02:11:11.600]  exist that eight-story ocean liner doesn't exist I don't exist all right
[02:11:11.600 --> 02:11:15.800]  I'm starting to be sarcastic here I got a lot of financial news Davos the world
[02:11:15.800 --> 02:11:20.040]  a leader meeting and saying how do we stop world revolution and their answer
[02:11:20.040 --> 02:11:23.960]  is tax the rich but you read the details it's tax the middle class give it to the
[02:11:23.960 --> 02:11:28.400]  bankers they still want 100 plus trillion like they said last year and give
[02:11:28.400 --> 02:11:32.280]  chicken feed to the underclass that everybody's being forced into basically
[02:11:32.280 --> 02:11:37.040]  to make everybody dependent and that's the game plan there and joining us to
[02:11:37.040 --> 02:11:41.400]  break that down is Bob Chapman of the International Forecaster with always
[02:11:41.400 --> 02:11:45.520]  his great financial breakdowns he did point out a long time ago as many of
[02:11:45.520 --> 02:11:49.760]  our guests did they would go into QE3 and now they announced what the last week
[02:11:49.760 --> 02:11:53.320]  oh we're gonna have some QE3 but it's gonna be different the Wall Street
[02:11:53.320 --> 02:11:56.880]  Journal said they don't really tell you how but gold and silver have of course
[02:11:56.880 --> 02:12:00.520]  started their way back up with the world announcement that they're firing up the
[02:12:00.520 --> 02:12:04.120]  printing presses so Bob what's happening right now in the world economy what's
[02:12:04.120 --> 02:12:07.840]  the most important things that you've seen out of Davos and what's happening
[02:12:07.840 --> 02:12:13.880]  with gold and silver right now Bob well I think what's significant is that none
[02:12:13.880 --> 02:12:21.160]  of the media the major major at all talks about the transference of funds
[02:12:21.160 --> 02:12:26.760]  from the Federal Reserve to the European Central Bank and we're talking
[02:12:26.760 --> 02:12:35.400]  about a trillion dollars and they were there we to use prudent usage of funds
[02:12:35.400 --> 02:12:41.120]  like banks normally do and they could jack it up to 10 trillion if they wanted
[02:12:41.120 --> 02:12:46.520]  to by borrowing borrowing against a trillion and for those who don't know
[02:12:46.520 --> 02:12:53.600]  right now their leverage is 30 to 1 but it's 70 a few years ago and they showed
[02:12:53.600 --> 02:12:58.040]  you the risk that they've taken and they will probably take into
[02:12:58.040 --> 02:13:02.840]  fractional banking so what does that mean it means that money is going to be
[02:13:02.840 --> 02:13:09.080]  almost endless for the next couple of years flowing from the Fed through the
[02:13:09.080 --> 02:13:14.880]  European Central Bank to the banks the banks 523 of them are your state's
[02:13:14.880 --> 02:13:19.640]  six hundred billion dollars they're supposed to take that money and buy
[02:13:19.640 --> 02:13:27.360]  their own bonds buy bonds from other lagged countries and spend enough in
[02:13:27.360 --> 02:13:33.360]  loans to keep the economy from a collapsing same plan we have here in
[02:13:33.360 --> 02:13:40.520]  America right now only it's come in a different form not the way it was done
[02:13:40.520 --> 02:13:47.120]  with the European Central Bank and it looks probably like at least from this
[02:13:47.120 --> 02:13:53.840]  viewpoint at this moment Greece is probably going to not continue as it has
[02:13:53.840 --> 02:14:04.000]  that I think they'll default in the US about I think they began their QE3 in
[02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:10.920]  January just a couple of weeks ago I expected them to announce it in June
[02:14:10.920 --> 02:14:15.840]  maybe it's gonna be in March like they're talking about and we're talking
[02:14:15.840 --> 02:14:23.240]  about the Federal Reserve going to the banks and buying their garbage those are
[02:14:23.240 --> 02:14:27.520]  bonds that aren't worth very much and other bad loans and things like this
[02:14:27.520 --> 02:14:35.560]  how much they're gonna spend probably 800 200 800 billion to 1.2 or 3 trillion
[02:14:35.560 --> 02:14:41.560]  and that money will go into the banks and the banks will be able to buy
[02:14:41.560 --> 02:14:51.320]  treasuries agencies as well as make more loans to keep the the economy
[02:14:51.320 --> 02:14:57.720]  the same is going to happen in Germany Europe and also in England your phone was
[02:14:57.720 --> 02:15:00.680]  only breaking up just a bit but I don't get how they can have the Wall Street
[02:15:00.680 --> 02:15:06.440]  Journal and others the last weekend ever so just calmly just say oh yeah the feds
[02:15:06.440 --> 02:15:09.480]  gonna have some more stimulus but they're gonna keep it under wraps I mean it
[02:15:09.480 --> 02:15:13.960]  just shows how incredibly secretive they've gotten they've gotten even more
[02:15:13.960 --> 02:15:25.160]  secretive well at Davos I saw the president of a JPM say that he thought
[02:15:25.160 --> 02:15:33.720]  that Mr. Bernanke had done the best job ever possible he was adjusted and of
[02:15:33.720 --> 02:15:40.640]  course this is the same propaganda that you receive all the time and Davos is
[02:15:40.640 --> 02:15:48.080]  just another Bilderberger meeting for all intention purposes generated toward
[02:15:48.080 --> 02:15:53.800]  finance and economics let me ask you this what do you make what do you make
[02:15:53.800 --> 02:15:59.320]  of Soros coming out and saying the most dangerous time in history we're all in
[02:15:59.320 --> 02:16:02.600]  deep trouble I'm not having any investments I'm not investing anybody's
[02:16:02.600 --> 02:16:08.480]  money this is worse than you know when I was you know in World War two yeah we
[02:16:08.480 --> 02:16:12.880]  know as a collaborator helping round folks up and take their property but I
[02:16:12.880 --> 02:16:18.440]  mean he's acting like now he had nothing to do with what's happened and and the
[02:16:18.440 --> 02:16:23.120]  fact that they're signaling that and the fact that Homeland Security is now
[02:16:23.120 --> 02:16:27.440]  announcing all these new political crackdowns and this new takeover of local
[02:16:27.440 --> 02:16:31.640]  police they want they always signal this stuff right before some big event Bob
[02:16:31.640 --> 02:16:36.800]  what do you say I think you're right and again I don't know when it's gonna come
[02:16:36.800 --> 02:16:43.120]  it's been in process will they have it during the presidential campaign maybe I
[02:16:43.120 --> 02:16:48.440]  just don't know I do know that what you say about our enforcement in their
[02:16:48.440 --> 02:16:54.200]  relationship where the military is going on and any listener on this channel
[02:16:54.200 --> 02:17:02.600]  knows that I think there's a possibility and you know you you don't like to see
[02:17:02.600 --> 02:17:10.000]  these things happen but I think generally speaking they're going to attempt to keep
[02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:19.560]  the stock market going sideways somewhere between twelve thousand five
[02:17:19.560 --> 02:17:26.080]  hundred and ten thousand or thirteen thousand and ten thousand somewhere in
[02:17:26.080 --> 02:17:34.080]  that area and I've I've been looking at I've been seeing all the emphasis on
[02:17:34.080 --> 02:17:43.080]  keeping the market up I think there's a possibility now from what they've had to
[02:17:43.080 --> 02:17:50.200]  say that perhaps they may take the market down a little deeper than they would
[02:17:50.200 --> 02:17:59.440]  have otherwise in a present presidential year and I think that's what we get to
[02:17:59.440 --> 02:18:05.040]  look forward during the year and as a result of all the spending both in
[02:18:05.040 --> 02:18:09.480]  Europe in the United States Golden server gonna go bonkers there's just no
[02:18:09.480 --> 02:18:14.440]  two ways about it Bob obviously what's the main driver not just QE3 but won't
[02:18:14.440 --> 02:18:19.720]  the facts are gonna keep interest rates at zero I mean what's bigger the QE3 in
[02:18:19.720 --> 02:18:24.120]  in in driving up commodities namely gold and silver but oil as well starting to go
[02:18:24.120 --> 02:18:29.720]  up I mean is it is it QE3 or is it the announcement to keep interest rates at
[02:18:29.720 --> 02:18:34.960]  zero for the big boys well there's three spot there and I'm going to give you
[02:18:34.960 --> 02:18:41.080]  spot number one that you didn't mention think about having the possibility of
[02:18:41.080 --> 02:18:48.320]  having ten trillion dollars in Europe that is really where all the trouble can
[02:18:48.320 --> 02:18:55.840]  come from and then you can follow up with QE3 and zero interest rates for
[02:18:55.840 --> 02:19:01.520]  three years they have no intention to doing anything about anything other than
[02:19:01.520 --> 02:19:06.240]  what they've been doing and while we're limping along they're doing things that
[02:19:06.240 --> 02:19:14.400]  you've been talking about with TSA and FEMA internment camps and turning our
[02:19:14.400 --> 02:19:23.440]  law enforcement into military which is a drastic mistake and and so it'll be a
[02:19:23.440 --> 02:19:28.000]  combination of things the year is not going to be as bad as people think
[02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:33.480]  although the market could get down say there ten thousand five hundred
[02:19:33.480 --> 02:19:38.680]  eleven thousand five hundred that's possible but otherwise the market will
[02:19:38.680 --> 02:19:43.560]  probably save you even but gold and silver gonna go through the roof I mean
[02:19:43.560 --> 02:19:51.200]  that's mega stimulus and is you know total monetization and so that that's
[02:19:51.200 --> 02:19:55.760]  not gonna stop wow it's gonna keep you hot stay there Bob let's get into more

[02:24:01.440 --> 02:24:06.960]  the Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones
[02:24:06.960 --> 02:24:13.360]  show because there's a war on for your mind I want to take a few calls for you
[02:24:13.360 --> 02:24:18.240]  Bob and then dr. Monteef is a great guy we love having him on the show he never
[02:24:18.240 --> 02:24:22.360]  contacts us though and says hey I want to come on I've got some breaking news so
[02:24:22.360 --> 02:24:27.440]  it must be important he'll be popping in with us and you'll be riding shotgun to
[02:24:27.440 --> 02:24:31.960]  give your view on it and your participation that is always valued
[02:24:31.960 --> 02:24:38.560]  but I wanted to raise this point for you Bob bombshell FEMA camps confirmed
[02:24:38.560 --> 02:24:43.200]  rendition hubs discovered and we have this report about the centers they're
[02:24:43.200 --> 02:24:47.480]  building at airports and transportation hubs though their own little FEMA camps
[02:24:47.480 --> 02:24:52.680]  to then send people off to different areas where they can be tortured or
[02:24:52.680 --> 02:24:56.200]  killed or disappeared or reeducated and the government now admits they're
[02:24:56.200 --> 02:25:00.040]  doing this I mean it's just the total certification that they're dangerous
[02:25:00.040 --> 02:25:05.680]  lawless armed and dangerous crooks who stage terror attacks as the pretext to
[02:25:05.680 --> 02:25:11.760]  overthrow the Republic I mean that's now all the fact no one can deny it but
[02:25:11.760 --> 02:25:17.600]  what do you make of the rollout here I've got one out of the Miami Herald Florida
[02:25:17.600 --> 02:25:21.360]  proposes using ball parks and stadiums as homeless shelters this is what we've
[02:25:21.360 --> 02:25:26.080]  always said they're gonna roll out the camps at first during the collapse as
[02:25:26.080 --> 02:25:30.480]  great places thank goodness they were there to take care of you and then
[02:25:30.480 --> 02:25:35.000]  there are areas where the troublemakers are kept and now that's all confirmed
[02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:42.680]  the emergency centers act and all of this what's your view on this well I
[02:25:42.680 --> 02:25:47.240]  think it's a lead-up and we saw that I think it was in Denver at the football
[02:25:47.240 --> 02:25:54.440]  game and where they rounded up the kids and and put them on one place and put
[02:25:54.440 --> 02:26:00.280]  the parents to the other and you had to comply or you didn't get your kids back
[02:26:00.280 --> 02:26:10.360]  same concept like in Florida lots of people homeless being put on mostly
[02:26:10.360 --> 02:26:14.920]  baseball fields as you mentioned next step is we can't have you be there
[02:26:14.920 --> 02:26:20.520]  anymore but we send you to a camp in Arkansas which is better equipped to
[02:26:20.520 --> 02:26:27.600]  take care of you one of their internment camps or some such place and I think
[02:26:27.600 --> 02:26:33.840]  that's the next step and that'll probably come I don't think it's gonna come
[02:26:33.840 --> 02:26:38.960]  quickly it'll take a while probably a year year after somewhere in that time
[02:26:38.960 --> 02:26:43.560]  frame well you're right and that's how they introduced it so the police at
[02:26:43.560 --> 02:26:47.200]  first and all the drills I've been to that I have in films like police take
[02:26:47.200 --> 02:26:51.040]  2000 and others they have the role players saying I'm an American don't
[02:26:51.040 --> 02:26:57.240]  take my guns but let me in the camp the people are fighting to get into the
[02:26:57.240 --> 02:27:02.280]  camp so they sell the psychology to the police and military like you're lucky
[02:27:02.280 --> 02:27:05.400]  to be getting in the camp but then there are troublemakers that also get
[02:27:05.400 --> 02:27:10.800]  forcibly taken so it's all about selling it just like TV sells torture and
[02:27:10.800 --> 02:27:18.960]  secret arrest now you know just selling cyanide like it's mother's milk making
[02:27:18.960 --> 02:27:26.840]  it acceptable making it acceptable yeah well Bob do you think people are gonna
[02:27:26.840 --> 02:27:34.600]  go along with this see I'm afraid I think most of them well see I had just
[02:27:34.600 --> 02:27:38.880]  forgotten I think you got to understand their state too they're out of jobs they
[02:27:38.880 --> 02:27:44.640]  don't have a house they don't have any they're living on a baseball field you
[02:27:44.640 --> 02:27:51.000]  know how can I get any worse government take care of me and sure we'll send you
[02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:55.280]  that camp over there other facilities are much better and not to go to the camp
[02:27:55.280 --> 02:27:59.520]  and that just sets the precedent to build the archipelago of camps and have
[02:27:59.520 --> 02:28:04.040]  the public rollout for them but you just mentioned Denver I'd forgotten we sent
[02:28:04.040 --> 02:28:09.240]  reporters to that city-wide drill and discovered they were busing the kids to
[02:28:09.240 --> 02:28:12.480]  the camp and then we found the Washington Post article from years before
[02:28:12.480 --> 02:28:16.840]  where it said in emergencies the state's gonna take your kids from you
[02:28:16.840 --> 02:28:21.960]  until you turn your guns in Bob that's right out of the Soviet Union yeah
[02:28:21.960 --> 02:28:28.240]  the program was on when I was on that day well we had all the feedback on the
[02:28:28.240 --> 02:28:32.760]  station here so that's how I knew about it well I'd forgotten about it you know
[02:28:32.760 --> 02:28:36.440]  you know you're in trouble when you for there's so much tyranny you can't even
[02:28:36.440 --> 02:28:41.600]  keep track of it all Ronnie in Texas you're on with Bob Chapman go ahead boy
[02:28:41.600 --> 02:28:46.640]  thank you Bob I appreciate the chance to talk to you I'm afraid we might
[02:28:46.640 --> 02:28:50.320]  disagree on this one idea and that is mood alteration which is all the
[02:28:50.320 --> 02:28:55.400]  mankind and selective persecution IE prohibition is now the tax-free cash cow
[02:28:55.400 --> 02:29:00.160]  organized crime thugs so could that possibly be a way to defeat these evil
[02:29:00.160 --> 02:29:06.000]  forces you're talking about decriminalizing marijuana or drugs I
[02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:11.920]  would imagine Bob what would that do to the new world order well take a lot of
[02:29:11.920 --> 02:29:20.800]  income away from them the numbers are astronomical five billion dollars or
[02:29:20.800 --> 02:29:26.080]  five hundred billion dollars or whatever it is yes five they certainly do not
[02:29:26.080 --> 02:29:32.720]  want the legalization of any kind of drug other than prescription drugs from
[02:29:32.720 --> 02:29:36.320]  companies which they control and all the stock in that's right stay there Bob
[02:29:36.320 --> 02:29:42.000]  Dennis wants to talk to you too we've got Dr. Monteith popping in as well stay

[02:35:34.240 --> 02:35:38.520]  and I'm just thinking about getting Dr. Montefon for an hour you know in the
[02:35:38.520 --> 02:35:42.520]  near future but calling up and getting him on he's a talk show host in his own
[02:35:42.520 --> 02:35:47.240]  writing a busy guy but rarely does he contact us with something that he says
[02:35:47.240 --> 02:35:53.240]  is breaking from a CFR source and of course he is a retired medical doctor
[02:35:53.240 --> 02:35:59.560]  somebody fighting the globalist for almost 50 years he's worked on Santa
[02:35:59.560 --> 02:36:04.040]  Cruz again for decades he led a delegation of physicians from Santa Cruz
[02:36:04.040 --> 02:36:07.640]  County to the house delegates of California Medical Association for 10
[02:36:07.640 --> 02:36:11.160]  years he led the fight with an organized medicine in California to address the
[02:36:11.160 --> 02:36:17.160]  AIDS epidemic as a medical issue rather than a civil rights issue he wrote the
[02:36:17.160 --> 02:36:22.240]  book AIDS the unnecessary epidemic the widely circulated pamphlet to deceive a
[02:36:22.240 --> 02:36:25.960]  nation a more recently a nation deceived and betrayed he also wrote brotherhood
[02:36:25.960 --> 02:36:30.720]  darkness he his public health approach to HIV epidemic was eventually accepted
[02:36:30.720 --> 02:36:34.800]  by the California Medical Association Dr. Montef currently spends five hours
[02:36:34.800 --> 02:36:40.600]  daily on syndicated radio across the United States and again he's published
[02:36:40.600 --> 02:36:47.260]  voluminous documents and articles and papers and he joins us now with another
[02:36:47.260 --> 02:36:50.880]  gentleman been fighting tyrants for close to 50 years Bob Chapman who writes
[02:36:50.880 --> 02:36:55.560]  shotgun with us from the International Forecaster every single week Bob's
[02:36:55.560 --> 02:36:59.160]  websites the international forecaster.com and of course Dr. Stan Montef's
[02:36:59.160 --> 02:37:05.760]  website is radio liberty.com okay good to have you Dr. Stan Montef what is going
[02:37:05.760 --> 02:37:10.240]  on my friend well you know very rarely do we really get it in the size of what
[02:37:10.240 --> 02:37:15.560]  people with the CFR are thinking I mean a lot of articles in foreign affairs
[02:37:15.560 --> 02:37:21.480]  magazine but one of these people on the inside really thinking and planning it
[02:37:21.480 --> 02:37:27.280]  because one of the things that's being used if I get Ron Paul Congressman Ron
[02:37:27.280 --> 02:37:33.040]  Paul to say the fact that he's dead by Israel he doesn't want to attack Iran he
[02:37:33.040 --> 02:37:37.200]  wants to take away their foreign aid therefore we should back one of the
[02:37:37.200 --> 02:37:43.000]  other establishment candidates of course of the important point that the
[02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:48.880]  Congressman Ron Paul brings out is we shouldn't be attacking Iran we should
[02:37:48.880 --> 02:37:54.160]  stop funding Israel's enemies I mean we give Israel's enemies three billion
[02:37:54.160 --> 02:37:59.200]  twelve million dollars a year we give Israel three billion dollars a year we
[02:37:59.200 --> 02:38:05.040]  control the foreign policy we dominate Israel which is not good for Israel we
[02:38:05.040 --> 02:38:09.520]  ought to get blood to be free and look after themselves be a friend with them
[02:38:09.520 --> 02:38:13.760]  well I agree with you Dr. Stan here to get one of the CFR guys saying here in
[02:38:13.760 --> 02:38:19.320]  a moment but now Israel's got actual political groups running ads against
[02:38:19.320 --> 02:38:23.080]  Ron Paul because he wants to cut off three billion dollars that's a foreign
[02:38:23.080 --> 02:38:29.040]  government through subsidiaries and proxies running ads in America inside
[02:38:29.040 --> 02:38:33.080]  of our political process I think that's illegal well I think it's illegal and
[02:38:33.080 --> 02:38:39.600]  basically it's the worst thing in the world for Israel if you hate Israel why
[02:38:39.600 --> 02:38:46.120]  you certainly wanted to beat Ron Paul and you want to attack Iran why what what
[02:38:46.120 --> 02:38:50.520]  is it what are we talking about we're talking about the plan that was laid
[02:38:50.520 --> 02:38:55.440]  out you can read it I in the of January February issue of foreign affairs
[02:38:55.440 --> 02:39:03.160]  magazine is written by a man his name is Matthew Cronick he was formerly a chief
[02:39:03.160 --> 02:39:09.840]  advisor to the Secretary of Defense until July of last year and now he is the
[02:39:09.840 --> 02:39:14.680]  nuclear security fellow with the Council on Foreign Relations assistant
[02:39:14.680 --> 02:39:19.920]  professor at Georgetown University but last week they had a little conference
[02:39:19.920 --> 02:39:25.480]  there private conference at the Council on Foreign Relations headquarters and
[02:39:25.480 --> 02:39:31.800]  since I'm part of the media why they sent me an opportunity to get the actual
[02:39:31.800 --> 02:39:37.640]  minutes of what was said so I wanted to see what this man said in private his
[02:39:37.640 --> 02:39:42.040]  name is Matthew Cronick and if you read this article in foreign affairs magazine
[02:39:42.040 --> 02:39:48.680]  he says this number one Iran is not decided whether to build a bomb or not
[02:39:48.680 --> 02:39:54.600]  number two Iran is not building a bomb number three if Iran did start to build
[02:39:54.600 --> 02:40:03.800]  a bomb if Iran that they should keep the international investigators out
[02:40:03.800 --> 02:40:09.360]  in the national top energy of people in fact if they should do any of these things
[02:40:09.360 --> 02:40:15.600]  decide to build a bomb start to build a bomb start to admit uranium then we
[02:40:15.600 --> 02:40:21.560]  ought to attack them and then going from that point of view his article is
[02:40:21.560 --> 02:40:27.280]  time to attack ever have well basically first you read the article it doesn't
[02:40:27.280 --> 02:40:30.920]  make any sense first of all they're not trying to build a bomb they've decided to
[02:40:30.920 --> 02:40:35.400]  build a bomb but we ought to attack them because they would be such a danger
[02:40:35.400 --> 02:40:39.240]  if they should ever get a bomb well doctor it's obviously you're concerned
[02:40:39.240 --> 02:40:43.240]  about this we all are for those that don't know Israel has come out and says
[02:40:43.240 --> 02:40:47.520]  that they see Iran's threat to close the Strait of Hormuz as a
[02:40:47.520 --> 02:40:53.000]  empty threat but meanwhile the London Guardian is reporting Iran to restart IAEA
[02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:59.320]  nuclear talks UN nuclear inspectors are due to begin three days of meetings in
[02:40:59.320 --> 02:41:04.280]  Tehran on Sunday the first just talks over three weeks Kissinger was in the
[02:41:04.280 --> 02:41:07.840]  news yesterday with the headline in fact pull it up guys please if you don't
[02:41:07.840 --> 02:41:13.160]  hear the drums of war your death so clearly the war is on and I think Iran
[02:41:13.160 --> 02:41:19.080]  understands that right now and may try to come to the table but the way some of
[02:41:19.080 --> 02:41:22.820]  the hawks are behaving in Israel and the US they're acting like they don't care
[02:41:22.820 --> 02:41:26.240]  what Iran does they want this as a political diversion what's your take
[02:41:26.240 --> 02:41:30.040]  on that how do we stop this and then I want to get Bob Chapman waiting in the
[02:41:30.040 --> 02:41:34.240]  wings his take well first of all we are already at war with Iran that's right I
[02:41:34.240 --> 02:41:39.080]  don't care what anybody says oh what of course you actually are paying terrorist
[02:41:39.080 --> 02:41:44.760]  groups to go into Iran and to kill people we gave several terrorist groups
[02:41:44.760 --> 02:41:50.280]  $400 million about three or four years ago to go into this from the Iranian
[02:41:50.280 --> 02:41:56.840]  government that is an act of war and today they've killed five Iranian nuclear
[02:41:56.840 --> 02:42:03.680]  scientists several key diplomats those are acts of war and we finance that we
[02:42:03.680 --> 02:42:08.480]  have our drones flying over their country we have put sanctions on them
[02:42:08.480 --> 02:42:12.720]  we've sanctioned their central bank so that they can't trade with other countries
[02:42:12.720 --> 02:42:17.920]  we want to sanction their oil so they can't sell their oil anyplace in the
[02:42:17.920 --> 02:42:25.680]  world so they will we are involved with and war with Iran but they haven't told
[02:42:25.680 --> 02:42:31.160]  the American people this but the frightening thing that Kronig said was
[02:42:31.160 --> 02:42:38.080]  that when we attack Iran why of course Iran we want what we will do will be a
[02:42:38.080 --> 02:42:41.520]  surgical strike we're not going to go to war with Iran we're not going to sit
[02:42:41.520 --> 02:42:46.080]  troops in what we're going to do is a surgical strike we're going to knock out
[02:42:46.080 --> 02:42:50.200]  their nuclear production facilities or at least most of them we'll leave this
[02:42:50.200 --> 02:42:54.600]  production facilities and pay Iran and other cities that is where they're
[02:42:54.600 --> 02:43:00.400]  inviting the Iranians and centrifuges so we'll wipe out all the nuclear bases and
[02:43:00.400 --> 02:43:05.400]  leave their military intact and leave their government intact but we're not
[02:43:05.400 --> 02:43:10.400]  trying to defeat Iran we're going to leave their military intact intact so
[02:43:10.400 --> 02:43:15.880]  they can retaliate why do they want them to retaliate well the government has
[02:43:15.880 --> 02:43:22.120]  to retaliate to maintain this support of the people so he's anticipating and this
[02:43:22.120 --> 02:43:27.920]  is all laid out this is his plan formally seen you're right in fact I'm
[02:43:27.920 --> 02:43:35.120]  meant to call Paul Watson and have him write an article West Plans Iran false
[02:43:35.120 --> 02:43:40.800]  flag or West Plans sophisticated Iran false flag because it's still a false
[02:43:40.800 --> 02:43:45.880]  flag to attack them and say that you know they're going to attack back and
[02:43:45.880 --> 02:43:50.440]  what you really want is the political diversion while the mega banks are
[02:43:50.440 --> 02:43:53.560]  robbing everybody while the rights are being abolished while the internet
[02:43:53.560 --> 02:43:58.440]  censorship is going into place that's what the globalists are really seeking
[02:43:58.440 --> 02:44:03.640]  is that wider war and you're right he says that and I haven't even really
[02:44:03.640 --> 02:44:08.280]  pointed that out and so I'm glad you called to point this out we need to
[02:44:08.280 --> 02:44:12.280]  make a bigger deal out of this let's get Bob Chapman's take on this and then
[02:44:12.280 --> 02:44:15.680]  expand on this Dr. Montee we'll have you back up for a full hour next week to
[02:44:15.680 --> 02:44:20.960]  really flesh this out further but stay with us Bob Chapman this is a big deal
[02:44:20.960 --> 02:44:27.480]  isn't it it certainly is and when did they started their hijinks about a month
[02:44:27.480 --> 02:44:31.840]  ago everybody was saying oh we're going to have a war and here it comes and so
[02:44:31.840 --> 02:44:38.520]  on and so forth and I said at that time these people are playing games this is
[02:44:38.520 --> 02:44:47.800]  a diversion logistically they're not ready to go into or do they like to do I
[02:44:47.800 --> 02:44:54.560]  think that's a year or more away and so I think it's just dancing around but the
[02:44:54.560 --> 02:44:59.040]  public doesn't know that now they're looking over there in Iran waiting for
[02:44:59.040 --> 02:45:04.440]  the Abraham lanking to be blown up going through the straight of a moose when
[02:45:04.440 --> 02:45:10.960]  they should be looking at pensions and profit-sharing and their shares and all
[02:45:10.960 --> 02:45:16.040]  of their investments and whether they're going to be working next week well
[02:45:16.040 --> 02:45:19.280]  certainly they want the war as a distraction and a threat of war but if a
[02:45:19.280 --> 02:45:23.480]  war does start Bob that would be a big distraction for the globalists around
[02:45:23.480 --> 02:45:30.140]  to ram a bunch of stuff through you're right and probably ultimately it will
[02:45:30.140 --> 02:45:35.880]  happen because they need it and the Russians are very well aware of this a
[02:45:35.880 --> 02:45:45.120]  few weeks ago one of their generals said on RT RT television that you get
[02:45:45.120 --> 02:45:50.360]  involved in Iran you're gonna have to deal with Russian that's right let's go
[02:45:50.360 --> 02:45:56.760]  back let's go back to dr. Stan Monteef on that how does Russia and China play
[02:45:56.760 --> 02:46:01.560]  into this and why would the CFR be so arrogant in an article they put out
[02:46:01.560 --> 02:46:08.000]  publicly titled time to strike Iran and say for those that don't know this is a
[02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:11.840]  main globalist mouthpiece where they communicate with each other so this is
[02:46:11.840 --> 02:46:17.840]  official hey they're gonna attack us we're gonna let them attack us I mean why
[02:46:17.840 --> 02:46:23.080]  would they be so bold as to admit that doctor well this is the most amazing
[02:46:23.080 --> 02:46:28.800]  thing this article which I have on my lap actually came for the transcript the
[02:46:28.800 --> 02:46:34.280]  meeting held in private offer a very few people this is not the general oh wait
[02:46:34.280 --> 02:46:39.200]  this oh wait you're saying this isn't the article I saw he wrote this is separate
[02:46:39.200 --> 02:46:43.320]  please read to us what he said and tell us where this is or if you put this on
[02:46:43.320 --> 02:46:48.080]  line yet I haven't put it online but I will tell you what I will have my secretary
[02:46:48.080 --> 02:46:53.080]  a fact you would copy this because I want you to get this information out
[02:46:53.080 --> 02:46:58.440]  basically what Kronig says is look basically we're not going to do a lot
[02:46:58.440 --> 02:47:03.480]  of harm to the regime we're not gonna harm their military or just going to
[02:47:03.480 --> 02:47:09.000]  take out their new pier facilities and when the moon wakes up and Kamani wakes
[02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:13.880]  up in the morning he's climbed that he's been attacked but his regime is intact
[02:47:13.880 --> 02:47:19.960]  his military is intact he's gonna have to do something to retaliate and but we
[02:47:19.960 --> 02:47:26.920]  have to be prepared to to absorb the retaliation of this remember this is not
[02:47:26.920 --> 02:47:33.160]  that the casual kind of this is a key man of the CFR he is a professor he is
[02:47:33.160 --> 02:47:39.400]  the standard nuclear security analyst for the CFR and of course he was the senior advisor
[02:47:39.400 --> 02:47:43.400]  to the Secretary of Defense well how are you getting this information I mean I
[02:47:43.400 --> 02:47:47.200]  saw what they published on their website you're saying this is the remarks I
[02:47:47.200 --> 02:47:50.880]  guess you've been in the media so long they just send you this stuff this is
[02:47:50.880 --> 02:47:57.880]  a covert meeting that was held last week and they basically if you were on
[02:47:57.880 --> 02:48:03.400]  their list which I am and they tell you when they hold these meetings they send
[02:48:03.400 --> 02:48:07.820]  the transcript of it and this was the most incredible thing I ever read let me
[02:48:07.820 --> 02:48:12.120]  tell you what he said they are going to retaliate and we are going to have to
[02:48:12.120 --> 02:48:15.760]  absorb retaliation and there were a couple of people in the audience that
[02:48:15.760 --> 02:48:21.320]  said but how can we be sure that they're not going to do a lot of damage I mean
[02:48:21.320 --> 02:48:25.360]  what happens if they they really hurt the United States and then the United
[02:48:25.360 --> 02:48:30.720]  States has to then take action against them a second time and first to be
[02:48:30.720 --> 02:48:35.840]  responsible as well well I don't think that will happen I guess this is what's
[02:48:35.840 --> 02:48:40.640]  going to happen but the thing that frightens me Alex is that if I were that
[02:48:40.640 --> 02:48:46.320]  for the Hemeny over there Hemeny I would immediately counter
[02:48:46.320 --> 02:48:55.520]  retaliation by attacking Israel and I mean can Israel withstand a thousand missiles 2,000
[02:48:55.520 --> 02:48:59.640]  missiles they have about a hundred thousand missiles between Iran and
[02:48:59.640 --> 02:49:05.120]  Islam and the mosque which is now getting sophisticated missiles why in
[02:49:05.120 --> 02:49:11.280]  heaven's name would anybody who really supports Israel want to actually go along
[02:49:11.280 --> 02:49:16.280]  with this thought of a surgical strike on Iran the other thing is first they
[02:49:16.280 --> 02:49:20.160]  could take out a couple of our aircraft okay so what is your point why do you
[02:49:20.160 --> 02:49:24.080]  think he's saying this well I think it because I think this is what they are
[02:49:24.080 --> 02:49:29.000]  really thinking about doing and I really believe that they put that article out
[02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:34.960]  if you read the Wall Street Journal I think it was the 18th of speak up for
[02:49:34.960 --> 02:49:43.280]  us doc there was a fellow named Mark Hulper and also the CFR who wrote an article on the editorial pages of the Wall Street Journal
[02:49:43.280 --> 02:49:49.440]  saying essentially the same thing I'm calling for this surgical strike on Iran
[02:49:49.440 --> 02:49:54.840]  so our children would be safer and their children our children's children would
[02:49:54.840 --> 02:50:00.760]  be safer obviously they're building support for a surgical strike remember
[02:50:00.760 --> 02:50:06.080]  this is not a war this is just a it is just a surgical strike fellow tell you
[02:50:06.080 --> 02:50:13.480]  what this I remember how World War one began I remember how I said you know what how it
[02:50:13.480 --> 02:50:18.840]  began over in the Gulf of Taukhead we were just gonna have a little short
[02:50:18.840 --> 02:50:25.280]  war over there in Vietnam and the fact that the former senior advisor of the
[02:50:25.280 --> 02:50:30.840]  Secretary of Defense of not only is talked about a surgical strike but the
[02:50:30.840 --> 02:50:37.880]  CFR the Wall Street Journal I think they're thinking about they they don't
[02:50:37.880 --> 02:50:42.920]  want a major war at this time but what happens if a man he doesn't do it's
[02:50:42.920 --> 02:50:47.080]  logical what happens to be attacked Israel what happens to be six three of
[02:50:47.080 --> 02:50:50.640]  our carriers over there yeah this is bizarre and if you think of the West is
[02:50:50.640 --> 02:50:55.800]  gonna sit back with a retaliation ever that's not gonna happen this is beyond
[02:50:55.800 --> 02:51:00.200]  bizarre let's get Bob Chapman's take on this and final comments from our other

[02:53:29.240 --> 02:53:32.680]  from grass-fed cows virtually all whey proteins are damaged by heat
[02:53:32.680 --> 02:53:37.240]  filtration and chemicals except one one world ways the most life-giving whey
[02:53:37.240 --> 02:53:41.600]  protein on the market it is changing the lives of its users in very positive
[02:53:41.600 --> 02:53:45.800]  ways one world way may act as one of the most important health foods to support

[02:54:15.760 --> 02:54:20.880]  you know Dr. Stan Monteith who's been interviewing myself for 16 years or so
[02:54:20.880 --> 02:54:25.200]  and Bob Chapman for decades I don't think he's ever contacted me wanting to
[02:54:25.200 --> 02:54:27.960]  come on I mean I can always get him on he's a he's a busy guy on his own right
[02:54:27.960 --> 02:54:32.720]  so he's obviously concerned about this Iran situation we see what the CFR had
[02:54:32.720 --> 02:54:36.760]  to say echoed by the New York Times Israel since his bluffing and Iran's
[02:54:36.760 --> 02:54:40.280]  threats of retaliation I guess because they threatened to do something
[02:54:40.280 --> 02:54:42.920]  aircraft carriers if they went back through the state of Hormuz they did
[02:54:42.920 --> 02:54:49.680]  this week Iran did nothing and here's the CFR saying if Iran responds when
[02:54:49.680 --> 02:54:54.120]  Israel hits them we've got to take it I don't see the West politically doing
[02:54:54.120 --> 02:54:57.880]  that I mean I know that it's hypocrisy to hit them and then not let them hit us
[02:54:57.880 --> 02:55:01.880]  back but I don't think that's gonna happen what do you think's going on here
[02:55:01.880 --> 02:55:05.760]  Dr. Stan Monteith then we'll get Bob Chapman's take well basically of course
[02:55:05.760 --> 02:55:10.000]  this is not Israel attack not less we're not gonna let Israel attack we're
[02:55:10.000 --> 02:55:15.320]  gonna do the job because according to Master Chronic we can do a better job of
[02:55:15.320 --> 02:55:22.400]  it and but we have to win so first of all believe the Iranian military power
[02:55:22.400 --> 02:55:29.040]  intact and their ability to retaliate intact so that we can so they build up
[02:55:29.040 --> 02:55:33.520]  support for the Iranian government if it were me I'd want it if I went to war I'd
[02:55:33.520 --> 02:55:37.800]  want to win the war they don't want to win the war but they anticipate a
[02:55:37.800 --> 02:55:44.040]  retaliation but they think it will be moderate and but what frightens me of
[02:55:44.040 --> 02:55:49.880]  course is that this could very well spell the destruction of Israel and it
[02:55:49.880 --> 02:55:55.440]  could be spelled as being forced to then counter whatever they do and if they
[02:55:55.440 --> 02:56:01.520]  took out even one carrier and killed a thousand American servicemen and they
[02:56:01.520 --> 02:56:05.720]  can do it they actually have a submarine there in the Persian Gulf if we lost one
[02:56:05.720 --> 02:56:12.240]  carrier in response to the retaliation what would we be forced to do when you
[02:56:12.240 --> 02:56:16.520]  start a war you never know how that war is going to end well it's definitely
[02:56:16.520 --> 02:56:23.120]  crazy we're not dealing with rational people this is so irrational as I've
[02:56:23.120 --> 02:56:29.120]  read it even people in the audience and these are the nationalists attending
[02:56:29.120 --> 02:56:34.520]  this meeting at the Harold Bradhouse yeah this is the insiders they were
[02:56:34.520 --> 02:56:38.680]  shocked I mean we're almost out of time here but you know there's a lot of talk
[02:56:38.680 --> 02:56:42.240]  about the West really put the moolas in and there's there's evidence to that and
[02:56:42.240 --> 02:56:46.480]  I ran Contra and the rest of it is there any evidence that the moolas still
[02:56:46.480 --> 02:56:50.240]  work with the globalist and this could all just be staged I believe that we
[02:56:50.240 --> 02:56:55.360]  have our Asian planet at the highest level of the government over there why
[02:56:55.360 --> 02:57:00.280]  in the world with any rational individual like Armageddon go out and
[02:57:00.280 --> 02:57:05.200]  say we better wipe Israel off the face of the earth unless he was play-acting and
[02:57:05.200 --> 02:57:10.560]  wants justification for a war well we know an attack on Iran will prop up the
[02:57:10.560 --> 02:57:14.240]  moolas that have got less than 30 percent approval rating we'll talk more
[02:57:14.240 --> 02:57:18.160]  about this next week Dr. Monty thank you God bless thanks so much bye bye thank

[02:57:21.400 --> 02:57:24.200]  you you were happy to let him run into some of your time but he's pretty
[02:57:24.200 --> 02:57:27.640]  concerned about this I hope you're right that it's a year off or may not even
[02:57:27.640 --> 02:57:31.600]  happen what do you think about the Iranians at the top still working for
[02:57:31.600 --> 02:57:39.440]  the West well I it is but the important thing with Iran is which way is Russia

[02:57:48.240 --> 02:57:55.280]  luminous very good question are they gonna aid Iran and it becomes a real
[02:57:55.280 --> 02:58:01.080]  war or are they gonna say oh we changed our mind and so that's very very
[02:58:01.080 --> 02:58:07.320]  important and we can't answer that because and I'm told you the joint
