[00:00.000 --> 00:15.000]  Another world, another time, in the age of wonder.
[00:15.000 --> 00:28.000]  Another world, another time, his life was green and good until the crucial fact.
[00:28.000 --> 00:33.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[00:33.000 --> 00:39.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:39.000 --> 00:58.000]  Get out of here! Get out of here! Get out of here!
[00:58.000 --> 01:17.000]  And this is the latest meme from Carpe Doctum that has Brian Stelter rushing to the local convenience store for Kleenexes.
[01:17.000 --> 01:21.000]  Now if that doesn't make you laugh and smile, hit it again! Hit it again!
[01:21.000 --> 01:30.000]  As we start the Alex Jones show on this 8th of April, 2019, it's a Monday.
[01:30.000 --> 01:34.000]  And the left is being memed into submission right now.
[01:34.000 --> 01:40.000]  Go home, bye! Go home to mommy! Go home to mommy!
[01:40.000 --> 01:49.000]  Oh yes, yes, put it on the big screen. I want it on all screens in every office, all day long.
[01:49.000 --> 01:54.000]  Welcome to the Alex Jones show, folks. Big show coming up here today.
[01:54.000 --> 02:00.000]  We've got a special guest in the next segment. Keep it running, just keep it running.
[02:00.000 --> 02:04.000]  Just keep it running. You don't have to have the music, but we can keep the B-roll going here.
[02:04.000 --> 02:14.000]  Because look, our next guest, folks, when Carpe Doctum puts out a meme like this,
[02:14.000 --> 02:20.000]  it goes so viral and it just devastates the left so much because it's a language that they can't speak.
[02:20.000 --> 02:27.000]  So like imagine you're sitting at the table and everyone's speaking a language and you don't speak it
[02:27.000 --> 02:33.000]  and they're laughing and they're having a great time and you're just sitting there like...
[02:33.000 --> 02:36.000]  That's the left right now with memes.
[02:36.000 --> 02:42.000]  We're speaking in a language that they can't understand and we're laughing and smiling and having a blast
[02:42.000 --> 02:47.000]  and they don't get it. And it's beyond just not having a sense of humor.
[02:47.000 --> 02:51.000]  It's they genuinely don't get it.
[02:51.000 --> 02:55.000]  And so now they are totally triggered by the latest Carpe Doctum meme.
[02:55.000 --> 03:00.000]  Obviously he's had a couple memes retweeted by the president that they're still crying about.
[03:00.000 --> 03:10.000]  If you are near a CNN office or an MSNBC office or a Democrat office, please get an umbrella,
[03:10.000 --> 03:15.000]  get a flotation device because flooding is expected in liberal tears.
[03:15.000 --> 03:27.000]  But folks, coming up in the next segment today is a special guest who has been directly affected by the meme war.
[03:27.000 --> 03:35.000]  And so this is an individual that wants to have his say on the Alex Jones show.
[03:35.000 --> 03:40.000]  And we give our opposition a platform here.
[03:40.000 --> 03:45.000]  We welcome their ideas here because we want to battle them intellectually.
[03:45.000 --> 03:48.000]  That's why Democrats don't want to have debates.
[03:48.000 --> 03:54.000]  That's why Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez won't speak to media that's not in a controlled environment.
[03:54.000 --> 04:02.000]  That's why she won't do a debate unless she's on the floor of her apartment in the middle of a bender eating off the floor
[04:02.000 --> 04:05.000]  with some bug-eyed rant.
[04:05.000 --> 04:12.000]  But coming up in the next segment, folks, you're not going to want to miss this special guest that's going to be joining us.
[04:12.000 --> 04:16.000]  Oh, the crew gives a little teaser.
[04:16.000 --> 04:23.000]  If you're a video watcher at infowars.com slash show or any of our great television syndicates,
[04:23.000 --> 04:27.000]  they just flashed an image of Pennywise the Clown.
[04:27.000 --> 04:29.000]  Oh, what's that?
[04:29.000 --> 04:32.000]  Oh, that was Brian Stelter.
[04:32.000 --> 04:36.000]  Oh, okay. That was CNN host Brian Stelter. I apologize.
[04:36.000 --> 04:38.000]  I get the two confused.
[04:38.000 --> 04:45.000]  So when we come back, special guest joining us.
[04:45.000 --> 04:49.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, you're not going to want to miss this.
[04:49.000 --> 04:53.000]  We are memeing the left into total submission.
[04:53.000 --> 05:00.000]  It's a language they don't speak, and so they're flopping around like a fish out of water.
[05:00.000 --> 05:02.000]  Infowarsstore.com is how you support us.
[05:02.000 --> 05:05.000]  And it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need, you don't want.
[05:05.000 --> 05:13.000]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[05:13.000 --> 05:17.000]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[05:17.000 --> 05:19.000]  How can I solve that problem?
[05:19.000 --> 05:27.000]  We have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off.
[05:27.000 --> 05:32.000]  The Alexa Pure Breeze groundbreaking iron cluster air filter technology.
[05:32.000 --> 05:35.000]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[05:35.000 --> 05:39.000]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[05:39.000 --> 05:43.000]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[05:43.000 --> 05:51.000]  I've got two in my home. You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[05:51.000 --> 06:18.000]  Don't live in a polluted major city in your home. Have clean air. Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[06:18.000 --> 06:24.000]  This is CNN's Brad Stelter here with my program, Reliable Sources.
[06:24.000 --> 06:34.000]  And on this weekend's edition, I decided to just let everybody know that I control reality and I dictate what you can and can't say.
[06:34.000 --> 06:47.000]  Seriously, there's a Steve Watson article up on Infowars.com and NewsWars.com where I explained that right wing media is influenced by the president and needs to be taken off the air.
[06:47.000 --> 06:55.000]  No kidding. It doesn't matter that Tucker Carlson has more viewers than the entire CNN lineup in 24 hours.
[06:55.000 --> 07:08.000]  That's the exact reason I'm saying he needs to be taken off the air because we're really jealous that we can't force feed you our anti-American garbage and the president's actually listening to it.
[07:08.000 --> 07:20.000]  The article at the evil website Infowars.com is titled CNN's Stelter Extreme Right Wing Media Influencing Trump Decisions.
[07:20.000 --> 07:39.000]  Hostess Tucker Carlson stirs up hatred of immigrants and he goes on to talk about how racist it is about Tucker Carlson. Well, you know Boycott had taken off the air like I lobbied for a year with Oliver Darcy to have Alex Jones taken off the platform.
[07:39.000 --> 07:55.000]  Now you can say, hey, Brian Stelter only has 100,000 viewers and that's the truth. And well, people like Tucker Carlson have 5 million and Alex Jones more than 5 million for episode, but that's why he has to be taken off.
[07:55.000 --> 08:05.000]  Then why do I have so much power? Well, you see Obama signed $2 billion into law in the John Warner Defense Authorization Act.
[08:05.000 --> 08:20.000]  And if Congress and the president ever figure this out and stop its funding entirely, we're screwed. You see, when Obama saw that Trump won the election in November of 2016,
[08:20.000 --> 08:36.000]  he put in the Defense Authorization Port Barrel billions of dollars to set up what the CIA calls, stay behind networks inside of the CIA and the Justice Department that would liaison with large institutions,
[08:36.000 --> 08:51.000]  think tanks and other groups with MSCM to then sue people, infiltrate them, demonize them, target their advertisers and shut them down. Working with George Soros, who overthrows all these other countries,
[08:51.000 --> 08:59.000]  we've basically been able to de-platform everyone from the Nestor-Sousa to end culture to thousands of other people.
[08:59.000 --> 09:09.000]  We started with Alex Jones with a large demonization campaign. Then once the first domino fell, well, you know what happened since then.
[09:09.000 --> 09:19.000]  Again, this is really our Achilles heel. That extremist Alex Jones goes on air and he goes to Congress.
[09:19.000 --> 09:32.000]  He tells you how big U.S. corporations sold out to China and are betting on them for global domination. Well, we take a lot of money at CNN from the Communist Chinese just like Hollywood does to put out their propaganda.
[09:32.000 --> 09:50.000]  Alex Jones talks about that, that makes Sundar the chai and others really get upset with us. But if Trump figures out the billions in funding we're used to illegally racketeer and shut down the media, what's independent, he can stop us.
[09:50.000 --> 10:05.000]  Now, here's what's bad. For us in the corporate lying globalist media, if you go back just a few months ago, you saw the tens of thousands of layoffs at fake news that we run at BuzzFeed and other places.
[10:05.000 --> 10:27.000]  That's because the funding for fiscal year 2017 and 2018 ran out of that two-year program. So, Senator Murphy and Senator Blumenthal, both from the wonderful state of Connecticut, have reintroduced the bill for even more money in the 2019 Defense
[10:27.000 --> 10:45.000]  Authorization Act going through 2020. If we get that funding, we can really expand. Now, the subsection is called, and I sure hope the White House isn't listening to this, because you heard me, that we depend, Trump at the White House and the Pentagon listening to right-wing media that actually
[10:45.000 --> 11:08.000]  saw the documents, they think it's such a strong bureaucracy, no one will notice. But the secret is, it's called the countering disinformation, foreign disinformation, and propaganda. And if Trump stops that, he'll stop our embedded groups of the government that are working against his agenda and against the free speech.
[11:08.000 --> 11:27.000]  We've committed a lot of crimes with our embedded stay-behind networks, trying to overturn the election and sabotage and leak on the president and Congress. If you think those crimes are being the crimes we've committed inside our embedded groups and the intelligence agencies are hundreds of times worse.
[11:27.000 --> 11:41.000]  It's so incredible we got away with it. So far, Nixon only was thinking about spying on a few hundred people and broke into one person, psychiatrists office. Well, what we've been doing is a lot worse with Big Tech.
[11:41.000 --> 11:57.000]  Project Veritas caught CNN and others working with Twitter and Facebook and YouTube to get into people's private accounts and spy on them. Well, remember, a year ago, we were inside Alex Jones's Google account and knew all about his finances and his private contracts.
[11:57.000 --> 12:16.000]  It's called Torsus Interference, but again, I'm Brian Stelter. And the head of CNN just got an award at the big free speech, Kayla, for his defense of free speech. And Christina Amonpour on CNN, she just called for the arrest of anyone that says Hillary's a criminal.
[12:16.000 --> 12:27.000]  Even James Colby said that was crazy. But again, I run your life. I decide what you can see. And I decide who controls everything.
[12:27.000 --> 12:46.000]  In my same reliable sources, we'll play some clips in a moment. This weekend, I also sent the changers of Carpink Dockham and the meme where he showed Biden groping Biden in deceptive fake news. We talked about how to counter it.
[12:46.000 --> 13:02.000]  Well, I talked about how this man's anonymous. And you know what we do at CNN? We like to dox people who are successful at exposing what authoritarian dirtbags we are. Now, I'm going to go back to the live show here in a minute with Owen Shroyer.
[13:02.000 --> 13:15.000]  But I'll be popping back in later in the hour. Remember, Americans, you're scum. We tell you what you can see, listen to and read. Don't visit news wars dot com.
[13:15.000 --> 13:24.000]  But I don't think at the end of the day, when voters go to the polling places next year, that this is going to be foremost on their minds.
[13:24.000 --> 13:34.000]  Well, here's what Biden is up against. Here's how it may keep coming back and back and back. This is a meme that was created by a semi-anonymous man from Kansas City, from Kansas.
[13:34.000 --> 13:40.000]  He posted it, and then the Trump world posted it, and then the president himself posted it on Twitter. It's Biden fondling himself.
[13:40.000 --> 13:47.000]  Now, on one level, it's just a funny meme. On another level, this is how politics has waged this day. These are the meme wars in action.
[13:47.000 --> 13:59.000]  Do you think Democrats understand what they're up against? Because there was a Mother Jones headline the other day saying the right-wing media machine is much more effective at this kind of visual communication, and the Democrats aren't even trying.
[13:59.000 --> 14:13.000]  Yeah, I mean, they are effective at digital communications, and they're effective at talking to their base. The question is how much it infects the rest of the coverage. But this is uncharted waters, as are many things with Trump.
[14:13.000 --> 14:24.000]  You have a president who's going to be live tweeting the opposite party's primary, and you better believe that when anything happens in the Democratic race, he will have a comment.
[14:24.000 --> 14:30.000]  He will advance a meme like this, and Democrats are going to have to figure out how to deal with it.
[14:30.000 --> 14:35.000]  The president has been under pressure, not just from Lorraine Grim, but from others on Fox and others in right-wing media.
[14:35.000 --> 14:41.000]  To some degree, that pressure has been there for two and a half years, but it's been ramped up recently. For example, we can have to go loot dobs on Fox Business.
[14:41.000 --> 14:51.000]  One of the president's favorite hosts called for him to fire Nielsen said that the country is in danger of tens of thousands or even millions of Americans being killed by illegal immigrants.
[14:51.000 --> 15:01.000]  The rhetoric on some of these Fox shows is absolutely extreme, but it is with the president's hearing all the time, and I think it contributes to his frustration and his struggles on this issue.
[15:01.000 --> 15:08.000]  But that's going to continue. The president wants a black or white solution to what is the situation filled with grays. I think that's the bottom line problem.
[15:08.000 --> 15:27.000]  Wow. All right. The big question here that we have, is Brian Stelter currently angry or is he currently crying? That's the question that we're trying to figure out right now.
[15:27.000 --> 15:44.000]  But if you are within the vicinity of a CNN studio or Brian Stelter, get an umbrella, get to high ground because there is a flood expected of liberal tears coming your way.
[15:44.000 --> 15:59.000]  More from Alex Jones and Brian Stelter on the other side. This is the Alex Jones show. Infowarsstore.com is how we stay on air despite Brian Stelter's censorship.

[20:23.000 --> 20:26.000]  Alex Jones back here with you on this live global broadcast.
[20:26.000 --> 20:42.000]  I'm going to be taking over from the studio in Austin, Texas here in just a few minutes. I'll be popping in with other reports throughout the next three plus hours.
[20:42.000 --> 20:53.000]  But the information I covered was all deadly serious. We've now tracked it back. It's all on the record that Brian Stelter and CNN along with a few other key people
[20:53.000 --> 21:04.000]  in MSNBC, the New York Times and the Washington Post are working directly with government contracts through the Defense Authorization Act of 2017.
[21:04.000 --> 21:18.000]  It was funded in 2016. Now remember about seven, eight years ago, Obama legalized using propaganda domestically against the American people
[21:18.000 --> 21:33.000]  and the US intelligence agencies who do engage in propaganda overseas to the CIA, State Department and other agencies could then engage in the use of previously illegal propaganda or lies against the American people.
[21:33.000 --> 21:43.000]  Public affairs of the Washington Post a few years ago even wrote an article admitting that indeed that was going on here domestically.
[21:43.000 --> 21:53.000]  So they're now using taxpayer money directly against Trump, directly against M4s, directly against Tucker Carlson, directly against Sean Hannity
[21:53.000 --> 22:01.000]  and trying to get everybody off the air because as Brian Stelter said this weekend, they're able to influence the president.
[22:01.000 --> 22:13.000]  Can you imagine Americans having popular shows that are private and that people have a right to tune into trying to influence the president and the president watches and listens to those shows.
[22:13.000 --> 22:22.000]  Remember the big horror two years ago when Kelly got in as a chief of staff and it was like General Kelly makes sure number one, no info wars in the White House.
[22:22.000 --> 22:33.000]  That was a real story because the president resonates what we talk about and they fact checked. Well, the president believed Jones's article that the polls are really higher than what they say.
[22:33.000 --> 22:41.000]  I was going out off a whole bunch of university studies where they over sample Democrats 10 to 15 points where they target Democrat voters in the polls.
[22:41.000 --> 22:48.000]  Everybody knows the damn things are fake. The New York Times said that Hillary had a 98% chance of winning until election day.
[22:48.000 --> 22:55.000]  So Brian Stelter is a flaming authoritarian and people laugh at him. He doesn't have any audience. It doesn't matter.
[22:55.000 --> 23:13.000]  He is the mouthpiece of the establishment along with Oliver Darcy and they work in tandem as the chief and deputy chief media analyst at CNN to wage war on freedom of speech and the press in this country.
[23:13.000 --> 23:21.000]  And now you notice they're moving on and saying, well, we need to arrest people that criticize the government or leftist.
[23:21.000 --> 23:27.000]  We need to call it hate speech now like Germany and other countries are doing under the EU.
[23:27.000 --> 23:34.000]  If someone is even mildly critical of the government, open borders, Islam, the sexualization of children,
[23:34.000 --> 23:43.000]  if a man comes into a hospital with a beard and says, give me a pap smear and the nurse says, sir, you don't have a cervix. The nurse gets fired.
[23:43.000 --> 23:49.000]  This is all real. This is all happening where they want us to submit to their tyranny.
[23:49.000 --> 23:56.000]  I mean, you hear about a guy with a beard and they try to make a nurse to a pap smear and you think, oh, that's isolated.
[23:56.000 --> 24:09.000]  Now, there's a bunch of cases like that. The BBC reports in England, they're pulling out toilets at shopping malls and Rolls Royce dealerships and putting a hole in the ground saying Muslims like this.
[24:09.000 --> 24:20.000]  So instead of them adopting our advanced culture, our advanced technology, our medicine, well, I mean, if the Muslims didn't used to have X-rays, let's just get rid of X-rays then.
[24:20.000 --> 24:30.000]  So it's about making you submit, making things go backwards where, oh, we let the Muslims sexually mutilate their daughters. It's okay. It's their culture.
[24:30.000 --> 24:43.000]  But then, again, they're putting huge signs up about manspreading and saying, cross your legs, cross your feet, like it's bad if you simply sit with your knees apart where it's comfortable.
[24:43.000 --> 24:51.000]  They're making normal activity somehow criminal and then legalizing criminal activity as long as it tears down the West.
[24:51.000 --> 25:03.000]  As long as it tears down the superior Renaissance culture and society that Western systems built that the whole world has emulated until now and the whole world wants to basically immigrate to.
[25:03.000 --> 25:14.000]  So the average minority, the average Muslim doesn't want to go with their family into open unisex stalls and squatting, crapping a hole in the ground.
[25:14.000 --> 25:22.000]  But if the establishment can make you do it, you will then put up with anything like saying, oh, you'll be arrested in the UK or California.
[25:22.000 --> 25:29.000]  If you misgender someone or if you put on forms mother or father, some people don't have mothers and fathers, so it's hurtful.
[25:29.000 --> 25:35.000]  You're like, well, that's insane. That doesn't make sense. It's meant to be insane to short circuit your common sense systems.
[25:35.000 --> 25:41.000]  In fact, I'm not obsessed with Brian Stelter, but he is pretty pathetic and actually watches reliable sources.
[25:41.000 --> 25:49.000]  He did something even more draconian in the same episode this weekend after he got done bishing and complaining on the same piece.
[25:49.000 --> 25:58.000]  But there are people able to communicate with not just the general public, but the president's watching. We're supposed to control reality.
[25:58.000 --> 26:14.000]  He had two guests on and talked about how criticism of female candidates is sexist and must be stopped because people aren't voting for female candidates because there is a patriarchy where we don't want to see women in power.
[26:14.000 --> 26:16.000]  No, that's not true.
[26:16.000 --> 26:29.000]  Component, aggressive, smart women that have wanted to be in power but in power is our district. The average woman isn't actually power seeking, but the average man isn't. But genetically, they say, oh, it's hundreds of thousands of years of patriarchy.
[26:29.000 --> 26:35.000]  No, it's called our development. It's called what the left always talks about, our evolution.
[26:35.000 --> 26:47.000]  That women can make babies. Women are nurtured. Men can go out and expend their lives and kill people. People expect men in leadership because that's the way it's been in every culture and every system because that's how we're designed.
[26:47.000 --> 26:56.000]  But the big takeaway is it's now sexist if you don't like Elizabeth Warren and are cringe worthy. Oh, have a beer, honey. Oh, come on in.
[26:56.000 --> 27:05.000]  It's all totally fake and she says to her intelligence, she's a Native American when she's not. People don't like Camilla Harris because she's cringe worthy.
[27:05.000 --> 27:15.000]  People don't like any of these female candidates in the polls, but they also don't like Beto O'Rourke. He's incredibly cringe worthy and faking like an Eddie Haskell on steroids.
[27:15.000 --> 27:23.000]  And then you've got just all, they're all cringe worthy. All of them. Democratic Party is a cringe worthy group of mystery and manipulators.
[27:23.000 --> 27:31.000]  And of course, since this happened last week, I talk about it every time I'm on air. Christina, I'm on poor talking to James Comey.
[27:31.000 --> 27:42.000]  And she says, hey, people criticizing Hillary, people saying lock her up. Shouldn't they be arrested for hate speech? That's how far these authoritarians have come.
[27:42.000 --> 27:53.000]  They're openly pushing this. Now, let's just not de-platform people. Let's arrest them. And then we're giving reasons that she should be indicted. We're giving reasons she should go to jail.
[27:53.000 --> 28:10.000]  Congressman Nunez, the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee has put forward eight, eight, I said six, six, it was eight, different criminal referrals of people that need to be indicted, laying out their perjury, laying out their conspiracy, laying out open and shut how they did it.
[28:10.000 --> 28:26.000]  So their response is, oh, you're trying to lock us up. We'll lock you up. But we're saying for illegal servers and selling out at the Chinese and perjury yourself to Congress and setting up a conspiracy to overturn an election and defraud the public and fake warrants and all the rest of it.
[28:26.000 --> 28:39.000]  We have evidence. We have reasons. We're calling for grand jury indictments. There are a whole bunch of grand juries confirmed to be open in Maryland and D.C. and other areas to indict people like Clapper and Brennan and Hillary and McCabe.
[28:39.000 --> 28:48.000]  And for others. So think about that, ladies and gentlemen. We're giving reasons. We're giving the evidence. We're giving the facts. Her response is just arrest them all.
[28:48.000 --> 29:09.000]  We'll be right back on the other side with more of a Troyer. I'm going to talk about AOC. Now she now is faking a bizarre urban black accent.
[29:19.000 --> 29:33.000]  My blood pressure has normalized. My diabetes has totally improved.
[29:33.000 --> 29:59.000]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[32:59.000 --> 33:06.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:10.000 --> 33:18.000]  Thank you all so much for coming together and gathering today because this is what organizing looks like.
[33:18.000 --> 33:25.000]  This is what building power looks like. This is what changing the country looks like.
[33:25.000 --> 33:33.000]  It's when we choose to show up and occupy the room and talk about the things that matter most, talking about our future.
[33:33.000 --> 33:43.000]  You know, Reverend, you bring up a funny anecdote and I'm proud to be a bartender. Ain't nothing wrong with that.
[33:43.000 --> 33:49.000]  There's nothing wrong with working retail, folding clothes for other people to buy.
[33:49.000 --> 33:55.000]  There is nothing wrong with preparing the food that your neighbors will eat.
[33:55.000 --> 34:00.000]  There is nothing wrong with driving the buses that take your family to work.
[34:00.000 --> 34:12.000]  There is nothing wrong with being a working person in the United States of America and there is everything dignified about it.
[34:12.000 --> 34:20.000]  I, in fact, am encouraged when people remind the country of my past, not because of anything about my story,
[34:20.000 --> 34:28.000]  but because it communicates that if I could work in a restaurant and become a member of the United States of Congress, so can you.
[34:28.000 --> 34:31.000]  So can you.
[34:31.000 --> 34:45.000]  And so what we are fighting for are the policies that are concentrated in working people and communities of color and historically disenfranchised to make that more possible in America,
[34:45.000 --> 34:52.000]  to make a fiat nation that keeps its promise and lives up to the words in our founding charter.
[34:52.000 --> 35:05.000]  So I want to thank you all again for joining us here today and I think it's a very important morning because with our work and if we organize and if we fight as we've never fought before,
[35:05.000 --> 35:12.000]  then it is entirely possible that we just listened to someone who will be the next president of the United States this morning.
[35:12.000 --> 35:22.000]  And the speech went on and on, but did you catch that beyond her trying to mimic a stereotypical black Southern drawl?
[35:22.000 --> 35:24.000]  She's really engaged in class warfare.
[35:24.000 --> 35:28.000]  It's okay to fold their clothes, it's okay to.
[35:28.000 --> 35:30.000]  She's saying white people.
[35:30.000 --> 35:33.000]  And of course you've got Joe Biden saying white men are inherently bad.
[35:33.000 --> 35:39.000]  It's all just this racist crud and she's the person that famously grew up in an almost all white rich neighborhood in New York.
[35:39.000 --> 35:42.000]  Supposedly worked a few months as a bartender.
[35:42.000 --> 35:45.000]  That's a pretty high-paid job, actually.
[35:45.000 --> 35:52.000]  And then that's the reason you've got to follow her and listen to her is because she came from nothing and all of it is a line of bull.
[35:52.000 --> 35:55.000]  Her pack that they set up raised $18 million.
[35:55.000 --> 35:58.000]  Where's the discussion of the millions of missing dollars?
[35:58.000 --> 36:06.000]  Vanessa Suza, a filmmaker, went to jail for $24,000 that he got his friends to give to his old friend that was running for Senate in New York.
[36:06.000 --> 36:13.000]  So Suza goes to jail for 20 months total, Senate's nine months he had to actually serve.
[36:13.000 --> 36:16.000]  He's the worst guy on the planet.
[36:16.000 --> 36:21.000]  He's the most evil person ever, but AOC, she gets to skate scot-free.
[36:21.000 --> 36:24.000]  But I'm digressing, ladies and gentlemen.
[36:24.000 --> 36:32.000]  AOC is up there just like Hillary when she goes to Kentucky or goes to Texas and Hillary famously went,
[36:32.000 --> 36:37.000]  I ain't no wide-tired, I ain't gonna give up.
[36:37.000 --> 36:39.000]  I mean, she didn't talk like somebody from Kentucky or Texas.
[36:39.000 --> 36:42.000]  She talked like Granny from the Beverly Hillbellies.
[36:42.000 --> 36:43.000]  Come on in here, Jeff Rowe.
[36:43.000 --> 36:50.000]  There's something swimming in the Seamanette pond and I got some possum pie for you cooking in there.
[36:50.000 --> 36:52.000]  Come on in here, Jed.
[36:52.000 --> 36:53.000]  Well, thank you, Granny.
[36:53.000 --> 36:54.000]  It's good to be here with you.
[36:54.000 --> 36:58.000]  I got some of that black gold bubbling up out of there.
[36:58.000 --> 37:06.000]  So what it is, is a disdain and a condescension for anybody in the South or anybody who's black or anybody who's Hispanic.
[37:06.000 --> 37:09.000]  Look, I made fun of Rick Perry whenever he went to Los Angeles.
[37:09.000 --> 37:14.000]  He was like, hello, good to see you.
[37:14.000 --> 37:19.000]  I mean, I've got friends, I've even got some family, a little bit of Mexican food restaurant.
[37:19.000 --> 37:23.000]  Hispanic comes over to, you know, he's the waiter, you know, they're probably the owner.
[37:23.000 --> 37:25.000]  Probably make more money than the person I'm sitting there with.
[37:25.000 --> 37:28.000]  And they'll go, I would like taco pay.
[37:28.000 --> 37:30.000]  So it's not just Hillary that's doing this.
[37:30.000 --> 37:32.000]  It's not just AOC that's doing this.
[37:32.000 --> 37:35.000]  There is a real condescension in liberals.
[37:35.000 --> 37:36.000]  Oh, and that's what the studies show.
[37:36.000 --> 37:38.000]  Paul Watts is on a powerful video.
[37:38.000 --> 37:44.000]  We're going to air next segment on this and then Ellen's going to give some commentary on the studies show.
[37:44.000 --> 37:45.000]  And Paul goes over them.
[37:45.000 --> 37:47.000]  Paul Joseph Watts and the stories on it.
[37:47.000 --> 37:57.000]  PaulWars.com that the left is many times more likely to slow down their voice and talk down to minorities.
[37:57.000 --> 37:58.000]  Oh, and guess what?
[37:58.000 --> 38:01.000]  The studies conservatives don't do that because they're their own people.
[38:01.000 --> 38:03.000]  They're actually just talking to you.
[38:03.000 --> 38:12.000]  But leftists tend to slow down their voices and then attempt to take on the accent of the person.
[38:12.000 --> 38:13.000]  Well, you're not taking on their accent.
[38:13.000 --> 38:19.000]  You're taking on the distortion of their home language that they have been accustomed to
[38:19.000 --> 38:27.000]  and that they have developed their lingual skills with that they're then projecting on the English.
[38:27.000 --> 38:30.000]  So again, you don't go to Russia or you don't go to Germany.
[38:30.000 --> 38:35.000]  And because you don't speak German, go, ah, yes, very nice Hans and Franz.
[38:35.000 --> 38:40.000]  I'm going to talk like Arnold Schwarzenegger because if I talk to you like this,
[38:40.000 --> 38:45.000]  you're going to understand me because it sounds like I have a German accent on English.
[38:45.000 --> 38:52.000]  No, it makes it sound unintelligible because they've been watching US TV where the accent is not expressed that way.
[38:52.000 --> 38:55.000]  So you sound like a crazy person.
[38:55.000 --> 39:00.000]  How about I went to Mexico again and say, oh, yeah, I'd like some of that one.
[39:00.000 --> 39:13.000]  Some of that one, Gustav, you know, the lobster, like some of those guacamole, I'm like, I would like lingusta, I would like guacamole, I would like cerveza.
[39:13.000 --> 39:16.000]  Again, this is the condescension.
[39:16.000 --> 39:17.000]  Pull up a study for yourself.
[39:17.000 --> 39:22.000]  They vary, but liberals are nine times more likely to say they're going to give a charity and not give a charity.
[39:22.000 --> 39:29.000]  Six times more likely to commit crimes like burglary, robbery, embezzlement because they're not liberals.
[39:29.000 --> 39:36.000]  They're criminal, deranged, lazy, following maniacs that have bought into a corrupt system of delusion.
[39:36.000 --> 39:38.000]  And that's just the facts.
[39:38.000 --> 39:39.000]  They're anti-free speech.
[39:39.000 --> 39:40.000]  They're anti-America.
[39:40.000 --> 39:42.000]  They're anti-everything.
[39:42.000 --> 39:49.000]  My God, just seeing in MSNBC a few years ago, they were trying to overthrow local police departments with their strong city initiative of Loretta Lynch,
[39:49.000 --> 39:53.000]  actually run by the UN, cops would get killed in another state.
[39:53.000 --> 39:57.000]  They'd say, well, cops are bad till they clean themselves up, they'll still get executed.
[39:57.000 --> 40:04.000]  If somebody else does something wrong, most of the time not even true, in another state, someone else deserves to die because they happen to wear a similar uniform.
[40:04.000 --> 40:14.000]  That's the left, saying because 2% of the South own slaves, 90% of people alive today have no body in their background even own slaves.
[40:14.000 --> 40:15.000]  Believe it or not, they did.
[40:15.000 --> 40:22.000]  Imagine saying a newborn baby owes somebody because they're a certain color from 170, 180 years ago.
[40:22.000 --> 40:23.000]  That's authoritarianism.
[40:23.000 --> 40:27.000]  You're bad because you're white, you're bad because you're a male, you're bad because you're a cop.
[40:27.000 --> 40:30.000]  You're bad because of this, you're bad because you worked hard to have money.
[40:30.000 --> 40:32.000]  You're bad, you're bad, you're bad, you're bad.
[40:32.000 --> 40:38.000]  They're making a nation of cowards and weasels and weenies and entitled scumbags that don't even know how to tie their shoelaces.
[40:38.000 --> 40:40.000]  And believe everybody owes them something.
[40:40.000 --> 40:45.000]  You go out to any leftist event and you're a conservative right of where a MAGA hat, they'll physically attack you.
[40:45.000 --> 40:49.000]  They'll howl and scream in a mass mob and come after you.
[40:49.000 --> 40:54.000]  Because they're cult leaders, AOC, veto, they all say the world's ending in 12 years.
[40:54.000 --> 40:56.000]  That's the new talking point.
[40:56.000 --> 41:06.000]  So imagine if you got invited to say, speak in a black church and you went to it, normally you talk like this.
[41:06.000 --> 41:10.000]  And you showed up and you went, how's it going, my brothers?
[41:10.000 --> 41:11.000]  How's it hanging?
[41:11.000 --> 41:14.000]  I mean, it's just obnoxious.
[41:14.000 --> 41:21.000]  Or as you went with the Hollywood Stereotypical or the gangster rap, look at that booty, baby, yeah.
[41:21.000 --> 41:23.000]  How's it going, high five?
[41:23.000 --> 41:25.000]  People say, man, you're a fake, get out of here.
[41:25.000 --> 41:27.000]  People respect you when you're real.
[41:27.000 --> 41:29.000]  Not a fraud like AOC.
[41:29.000 --> 41:30.000]  We're going to go to break.
[41:30.000 --> 41:34.000]  Owen's going to take back over, going to air this piece or Paul breaks it down.
[41:34.000 --> 41:38.000]  But there's so much news coming out that the fraud of these people is essential.
[41:38.000 --> 41:44.000]  Please don't forget, they've de-platformed us except on AM and FM, TV and infowars.com and newswars.com.
[41:44.000 --> 41:47.000]  When you spread those links, you override their censorship.
[41:47.000 --> 41:50.000]  And I've been out of town covering a bunch of really big news.
[41:50.000 --> 41:52.000]  I haven't launched new specials.
[41:52.000 --> 41:56.000]  The Save the First Amendment special was supposed to end last Wednesday.
[41:56.000 --> 41:57.000]  It's got to end today.
[41:57.000 --> 41:58.000]  I'm actually going to get on the phone.
[41:58.000 --> 42:01.000]  I'm out here in Los Angeles with my crew in Austin.
[42:01.000 --> 42:02.000]  I'm up with new specials.
[42:02.000 --> 42:03.000]  They're going to launch tomorrow.
[42:03.000 --> 42:11.000]  But this has been the biggest special of the year, store-wide free shipping, 60% to 50% off, all the supplements, other big discounts.
[42:11.000 --> 42:13.000]  The special must and will end today.
[42:13.000 --> 42:15.000]  Your purchase supports the broadcast.
[42:15.000 --> 42:21.000]  Whether it's the best fish oil for your body, whether it's the best new tropics like Brainforce,
[42:21.000 --> 42:27.000]  whether it's just all the amazing products, they're at infowars.com or infowars.com.
[42:27.000 --> 42:29.000]  And all those specials have to end today.
[42:29.000 --> 42:32.000]  And it's only you purchasing those products that fund the operation.
[42:32.000 --> 42:36.000]  Sign up for auto-ship on things like the Wake Up America coffee after you try it and love it.
[42:36.000 --> 42:39.000]  Or the protein bars or things that you're going to want to reorder.
[42:39.000 --> 42:41.000]  Get an additional 10% off.
[42:41.000 --> 42:45.000]  infowars.com funding tomorrow's news today.
[42:45.000 --> 42:50.000]  Now we're about to go to break and Owen Schroyer will introduce the Paul Joseph Watson piece on the other side.
[42:50.000 --> 42:59.000]  Whatever you do, however you're listening, override the sensors and tell people how you're listening and break the globalist back.
[42:59.000 --> 43:02.000]  Well, I've got some really good news for all the viewers and all the listeners.
[43:02.000 --> 43:05.000]  This was going to be a big loss because we couldn't get the deep earth crystals anymore.
[43:05.000 --> 43:12.000]  It's been a year and a half fight, but we have the original producer, the original crystal source, the best atomic iodine in the world.
[43:12.000 --> 43:14.000]  X2 is back. We got it.
[43:14.000 --> 43:17.000]  This deal just happened about a month ago. We rushed it into production.
[43:17.000 --> 43:20.000]  It's been bottled. The labels are being put on today.
[43:20.000 --> 43:25.000]  And then it's going to be on an 18-wheeler right here to Austin from the plant in the Rockies.

[45:00.000 --> 45:05.000]  Alex Jones here with an extremely exciting announcement that will be a gift to yourself
[45:05.000 --> 45:09.000]  and a gift to the info war to fight the globalist and live in a free society.
[45:09.000 --> 45:16.000]  Several years ago, I set out with top formulators in the U.S. to create the strongest, most concentrated,
[45:16.000 --> 45:22.000]  over-the-top stamina, libido, workout, brain formula that is safe.
[45:22.000 --> 45:27.000]  I know from using this myself the last few months and from seeing my friends and family use it
[45:27.000 --> 45:33.000]  that this new product is going to end up being the number one best-selling product at infowarslife.com because it works so well.
[45:33.000 --> 45:35.000]  This is a gift you want to give yourself.

[45:56.000 --> 46:00.000]  Everybody needs to try alpha power today.
[46:00.000 --> 46:05.000]  There are thousands of ideologies out there, hundreds of different political systems,
[46:05.000 --> 46:08.000]  and most of them are funded by the globalist.
[46:08.000 --> 46:11.000]  Info wars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[46:11.000 --> 46:14.000]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[46:14.000 --> 46:15.000]  I didn't invent all this.
[46:15.000 --> 46:20.000]  I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana, and what really works for humanity,
[46:20.000 --> 46:22.000]  and I'm simply trying to bring it back.
[46:22.000 --> 46:26.000]  And lo and behold, it's super popular like it's always been.
[46:26.000 --> 46:29.000]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately
[46:29.000 --> 46:34.000]  because we have the light in the dark of the night that sends chills up my spine.
[46:34.000 --> 46:37.000]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and info wars
[46:37.000 --> 46:41.000]  by buying the great products at infowarstore.com, by spreading the articles,
[46:41.000 --> 46:45.000]  by spreading the videos, and by praying for this operation and for praying for this nation
[46:45.000 --> 46:47.000]  and the world for peace and discernment.
[46:47.000 --> 46:52.000]  For myself and the whole info wars family, I want to thank all of you for what you've done
[46:52.000 --> 46:55.000]  because without you, info wars is nothing.
[46:55.000 --> 47:08.000]  You are the info war, and I salute you.
[47:25.000 --> 47:35.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[47:35.000 --> 47:40.000]  We're back here in the info wars world headquarters in Austin, Texas.
[47:40.000 --> 47:47.000]  And as promised, we now go to the latest report from Paul Joseph Watson
[47:47.000 --> 47:51.000]  breaking down the racism of liberal progressives.
[47:51.000 --> 47:56.000]  So apparently Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez thinks she's black.
[47:56.000 --> 47:58.000]  The fight's been long, y'all.
[47:58.000 --> 48:01.000]  This is what organizing looks like.
[48:01.000 --> 48:04.000]  This is what building power looks like.
[48:04.000 --> 48:07.000]  I'm proud to be a bartender.
[48:07.000 --> 48:09.000]  Ain't nothing wrong with that.
[48:09.000 --> 48:13.000]  I haven't heard an accent that fake since Hillary Clinton overdosed on hot sauce.
[48:13.000 --> 48:16.000]  I don't feel no ways tired.
[48:16.000 --> 48:23.000]  Wait, according to AOC, anyone who claims she's putting on a black accent is a conspiracy theorist.
[48:23.000 --> 48:26.000]  She says she speaks the same, no matter the audience.
[48:26.000 --> 48:27.000]  Really?
[48:27.000 --> 48:33.000]  Okay, so let's compare her saying the word like to a white person during a CBS news interview.
[48:33.000 --> 48:34.000]  I like the fruit roll-ups.
[48:34.000 --> 48:35.000]  Yeah.
[48:35.000 --> 48:36.000]  Oh, I like the like.
[48:36.000 --> 48:39.000]  To her saying the word like to a room full of black people.
[48:39.000 --> 48:42.000]  This is what building power looks like.
[48:42.000 --> 48:44.000]  Let's play a game of spot the difference.
[48:44.000 --> 48:51.000]  Like play, like play, like play, like play, like play, like play.
[48:51.000 --> 48:55.000]  Yeah, maybe I'm just hearing things, but I detect a slight deviation.
[48:55.000 --> 48:58.000]  It's just like, it's like, like like this, like play.
[48:58.000 --> 49:01.000]  As much as the right one is to distort and deflect, I am from the Bronx.
[49:01.000 --> 49:05.000]  I act and talk like it, especially when I'm fired up and especially when I'm home.
[49:05.000 --> 49:08.000]  Okay, you're from the Bronx, which is 43% black.
[49:08.000 --> 49:09.000]  So that would make sense.
[49:09.000 --> 49:11.000]  Oh, wait a minute.
[49:11.000 --> 49:15.000]  You spent most of your childhood growing up in Yorktown Heights.
[49:15.000 --> 49:17.000]  Which is, drumroll please.
[49:17.000 --> 49:21.000]  Drumroll
[49:21.000 --> 49:26.000]  90% white and only 2.4% African American.
[49:26.000 --> 49:30.000]  So if you act and talk like you're from the Bronx, which is what you claim,
[49:30.000 --> 49:34.000]  then you must be acting and talking like a 5 year old child.
[49:34.000 --> 49:36.000]  Because that's when you left the Bronx.
[49:36.000 --> 49:38.000]  Wait a minute, that actually makes sense.
[49:38.000 --> 49:40.000]  And like, you know, blah blah blah.
[49:40.000 --> 49:46.000]  So essentially, AOC is telling us that she talks and acts like a 5 year old black kid.
[49:46.000 --> 49:47.000]  Ain't nothing wrong with that.
[49:47.000 --> 49:48.000]  What's next?
[49:48.000 --> 49:51.000]  Is she gonna go full Rachel Polish all and get the boot polish out?
[49:51.000 --> 49:54.000]  Maybe she can ask for tips from Governor Ralph Northam.
[49:54.000 --> 49:56.000]  Is she gonna start dropping N-word bombs?
[49:56.000 --> 49:59.000]  I'm gonna say the N-word.
[49:59.000 --> 50:03.000]  There's actually more footage from the AOC speech which the media didn't show you.
[50:03.000 --> 50:04.000]  But I can.
[50:04.000 --> 50:10.000]  That was the last time a white lady took off after you when you threw your own soda
[50:10.000 --> 50:15.000]  and your grape sodas on the ground.
[50:15.000 --> 50:20.000]  Apparently, she's also been lined up for a debate appearance on Dr. Phil.
[50:20.000 --> 50:21.000]  Kiss me outside, how about that?
[50:21.000 --> 50:26.000]  But then again, according to AOC, debating her is cat calling.
[50:26.000 --> 50:27.000]  So maybe not.
[50:27.000 --> 50:28.000]  Ain't nobody got time for that.
[50:28.000 --> 50:29.000]  Ain't nobody got time for that.
[50:29.000 --> 50:35.000]  Rumour has it that AOC has already selected her running mate for a future presidential campaign.
[50:35.000 --> 50:37.000]  Buyakasha!
[50:37.000 --> 50:40.000]  Professor G in the house, aye?
[50:40.000 --> 50:43.000]  Although he faces some stiff competition from Woe Vicki.
[50:43.000 --> 50:44.000]  Hey guys, welcome back today.
[50:44.000 --> 50:47.000]  I'm gonna show you how to slay a black girl like mine's edges.
[50:47.000 --> 50:52.000]  There's nothing wrong with working retail, folding clothes for other people to buy.
[50:52.000 --> 50:56.000]  Yeah, maybe you should have thought of that when you cost New Yorkers 25,000 jobs
[50:56.000 --> 50:59.000]  by getting that Amazon HQ cancelled.
[50:59.000 --> 51:01.000]  But none of this matters to AOC anyway,
[51:01.000 --> 51:07.000]  because remember, being morally right is more important than being factually correct.
[51:07.000 --> 51:14.000]  I think that there's a lot of people more concerned about being precisely, factually,
[51:14.000 --> 51:19.000]  and semantically correct than about being morally right.
[51:19.000 --> 51:21.000]  But being factually correct is important.
[51:21.000 --> 51:22.000]  Ain't nobody got time for that.
[51:22.000 --> 51:26.000]  So I can factually state that she's faking a black accent.
[51:26.000 --> 51:27.000]  Looks slight.
[51:27.000 --> 51:33.000]  But she's still morally superior because, because reasons or something.
[51:33.000 --> 51:35.000]  Ain't nothing wrong with that.
[51:35.000 --> 51:40.000]  But does it really surprise anyone that a Democrat is once again pandering to African-Americans
[51:40.000 --> 51:42.000]  by feigning relatability?
[51:42.000 --> 51:46.000]  A recent Yale study found that liberals deliberately dumbed down their vocabulary
[51:46.000 --> 51:50.000]  when speaking to black people compared to conservatives who don't.
[51:50.000 --> 51:55.000]  So while they'll virtue signal until they're blue in the face about how much they respect minorities,
[51:55.000 --> 52:01.000]  when they actually speak to minorities, they immediately adopt the bigotry of low expectations.
[52:01.000 --> 52:05.000]  Does it surprise anyone that AOC is once again feigning relatability?
[52:05.000 --> 52:10.000]  Seriously, how many tedious Instagram videos of your private life is too many?
[52:10.000 --> 52:17.000]  And how does someone who apparently lives with the existential terror of the entire world coming to an end in 12 years
[52:17.000 --> 52:21.000]  go through the meaningless drudgery of putting together IKEA furniture?
[52:21.000 --> 52:27.000]  Like, at least I don't do what Border Patrol do, you know?
[52:27.000 --> 52:37.000]  Like, for real, they're out there and they're actually like checking how brown kids are.
[52:37.000 --> 52:43.000]  And if they're brown enough, swear to God, they will check and if they're brown enough,
[52:43.000 --> 52:47.000]  they inject them with needles.
[52:47.000 --> 52:49.000]  At the border.
[52:49.000 --> 52:51.000]  Prove me wrong.
[52:51.000 --> 52:53.000]  Prove me wrong.
[52:53.000 --> 52:55.000]  Life is a stranger.
[52:55.000 --> 53:00.000]  Unfortunately for AOC, the same number of people convinced by her fake accent
[53:00.000 --> 53:03.000]  were convinced by her green new deal.
[53:03.000 --> 53:06.000]  That would be zero, which despite what the media told you,
[53:06.000 --> 53:10.000]  is the same number of conservatives who were triggered by that dancing video.
[53:10.000 --> 53:12.000]  That would also be zero.
[53:12.000 --> 53:17.000]  If I had less confidence in that fake accent, then I would enter in the Venezuelan shopping mall
[53:17.000 --> 53:21.000]  in the hope of buying toilet paper, which is less than zero.
[53:21.000 --> 53:25.000]  Like, it's like, like, like this, like, like, like, nah.
[53:25.000 --> 53:30.000]  So there you go. AOC living in denial of reality,
[53:30.000 --> 53:36.000]  but her popularity is waning and who knows how long she'll last in Congress.
[53:36.000 --> 53:41.000]  But that is the latest from Paul Joseph Watson.
[53:41.000 --> 53:46.000]  Now, I've got in front of me here on the desk obviously a bunch of news we're going to eventually get to today.
[53:46.000 --> 53:50.000]  We're going to have more from Alex Jones coming up in the next hour.
[53:50.000 --> 53:53.000]  And then Carpe Dongtum joins me in the third hour.
[53:53.000 --> 53:56.000]  Will Johnson will host the fourth hour.
[53:56.000 --> 54:01.000]  And what I think I might try to do is get through all this news and all the videos today.
[54:01.000 --> 54:07.000]  And then I'm going to be pulling double duty and hosting the war room and then just dedicate the three hours of the war room
[54:07.000 --> 54:13.000]  that I normally host from three to six p.m. following the Alex Jones show weekdays to your phone calls.
[54:13.000 --> 54:19.000]  So I think we'll be able to get all the news and all the videos and we'll have our guests on as well.
[54:19.000 --> 54:23.000]  And then in the war room, I'll just open up the phone lines and take your call.
[54:23.000 --> 54:25.000]  So if there's anything you wanted to call about today.
[54:25.000 --> 54:29.000]  But in the meantime, since I am doing double duty, I'm probably going to need a little turbo force.
[54:29.000 --> 54:31.000]  So what I've done here.
[54:31.000 --> 54:39.000]  Now, normally when I drink turbo force, I usually like to drink it before the war room.
[54:39.000 --> 54:42.000]  And I get a kick and then it sustains me through the rest of the night.
[54:42.000 --> 54:44.000]  I get to work out in and everything.
[54:44.000 --> 54:49.000]  And I usually just pound it down and chase it with some brain force plus.
[54:49.000 --> 54:54.000]  But Will Johnson, who is hosting the fourth hour has made a suggestion before to me.
[54:54.000 --> 55:00.000]  And that is to drink it with hot water like you would sip on tea.
[55:00.000 --> 55:05.000]  So that's actually what I'm going to do today on the Alex Jones show.
[55:05.000 --> 55:15.000]  So let me just empty my packet of turbo force into my infowars tumbler, which you can also get at info wars store.com.
[55:15.000 --> 55:18.000]  Okay, go ahead and knock that out.
[55:18.000 --> 55:19.000]  Go ahead and stir that in.
[55:19.000 --> 55:21.000]  I've got a pretty hot water here.
[55:21.000 --> 55:26.000]  It's been sitting for a minute, so should be able to drink this without it having to wait too long.
[55:26.000 --> 55:28.000]  I kind of feel like I'm doing an infomercial.
[55:28.000 --> 55:32.000]  Can we get like, oh, look at the crew with the shot.
[55:32.000 --> 55:34.000]  Oh my gosh.
[55:34.000 --> 55:40.000]  Oh, me stirring a cup of turbo force has never looked so good.
[55:40.000 --> 55:43.000]  Can I get that shot again?
[55:43.000 --> 55:47.000]  This is like the greatest infomercial ever shot on live TV.
[55:47.000 --> 55:55.000]  Look at that with the with the imposed image of me stirring in the box of turbo force on the desk.
[55:55.000 --> 56:01.000]  Oh my gosh, we're about to sell out a turbo force with this one, folks, so you better go to info wars store.com immediately.
[56:01.000 --> 56:03.000]  All right, you think I got it?
[56:03.000 --> 56:05.000]  Well, let's get a camera shot of that.
[56:05.000 --> 56:10.000]  Oh yeah, look at the turbo force spinning so eloquently.
[56:10.000 --> 56:16.000]  Nothing to disturb it just pure energy waiting for me to consume it.
[56:16.000 --> 56:18.000]  Yes.
[56:18.000 --> 56:24.000]  I'm thinking of my turbo force and how great it's going to make me feel.
[56:24.000 --> 56:30.000]  Pure energy that I'm going to get from my turbo force at info wars store.com.
[56:30.000 --> 56:35.000]  Yes, total equilibrium.
[56:35.000 --> 56:37.000]  And so there you go.
[56:37.000 --> 56:41.000]  And so I let's go ahead and take the first sip of this again.
[56:41.000 --> 56:50.000]  Normally I drink the turbo force with either cold water or with the or just with tap water and I chase it with brain force plus.
[56:50.000 --> 56:55.000]  But today I'm taking Will Johnson advice from UniteAmericanfirst.com.
[56:55.000 --> 57:02.000]  He sips his turbo force warm like it's tea and then you kind of sip on it and you kind of get that energy slowly.
[57:02.000 --> 57:07.000]  But let me just give this a try right now.
[57:07.000 --> 57:09.000]  Hmm.
[57:09.000 --> 57:12.000]  Hmm.
[57:12.000 --> 57:13.000]  Hmm.
[57:13.000 --> 57:17.000]  Interesting indeed.
[57:17.000 --> 57:28.000]  It has the fruity essence of the turbo force with the soothing warmth of tea.
[57:28.000 --> 57:33.000]  But it doesn't kind of have that herbally earthy grainy aftertaste.
[57:33.000 --> 57:40.000]  It's just kind of like a smooth fruity sensation with soothing heat.
[57:40.000 --> 57:42.000]  That's good right there.
[57:42.000 --> 57:47.000]  So turbo force also good with warm water. Wow, that's good stuff.
[58:13.000 --> 58:18.000]  That sure get you a quick boost but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[58:18.000 --> 58:27.000]  We have developed hands down from our research the most powerful healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[58:27.000 --> 58:30.000]  There's nothing else like it. You must experience it.
[58:30.000 --> 58:37.000]  It is a total game changer and it comes in easy to use packets to mix in the fruges or water, whatever you'd like.
[58:37.000 --> 58:46.000]  So it's very, very strong. It lasts 10 hours. So take a half pack at the first time you take it because turbo force is named turbo force because it will take you into overdrive.
[58:46.000 --> 59:08.000]  Turbo force in EnforceLive.com.
[59:17.000 --> 59:29.000]  It's compact in size, easy to install and maintain and keeps fluoride and other dangerous toxins out of your water supply and away from you and your family.
[59:29.000 --> 59:36.000]  With its broad spectrum contaminant reduction, you'll only need this one filter for clean and refreshing water all over your home.
[59:36.000 --> 59:50.000]  Head to infowarstore.com and whether it's your first water filtration purchase or you're looking to replace your current rundown systems, it's time to go big and go home with the pro pure whole house filtration system today.
[59:50.000 --> 01:00:07.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:16.000]  You found it. The tip of the spear. It is the Alex Jones show with Owen Troyer.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:26.000]  Welcome back to the Alice Jones show, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:37.000]  Now, this morning, I went to the local Democrat offices here in Austin, Texas, because I actually have a stack of news right here, folks.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:46.000]  U.S. would run out of avocados in three weeks if border is closed. Washington Post. U.S. Mexico border showdown would affect avocado prices. Vox. Politifact.
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:55.000]  Would U.S. run out of avocados if Trump closes border? They said maybe not run out, but it would be dire. Reuters. U.S. clamoring for avocados after Trump threat to shut Mexico border.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.000]  CNN. Trump's border shut down would hit avocados.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:09.000]  So, I went to the Democrat offices today to try to do something about this so we could do something about the national emergency at the southern border. Here's a preview of how that went.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:17.000]  Back of news here. I don't have an extra hand. If I had a third hand, I'd show you that we can't shut the border because we'd run out of avocados. Have you heard this?
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000]  I wouldn't be surprised.
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:27.000]  Also, I have a thing of avocados here, as you can see, that I wanted to bring to you and I wanted to ask you now that you guys, can I set up on this desk right here?
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.000]  Yes, you may.
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:40.000]  So, I'm going to set up on this desk right here. So, now that we've got the avocados here, you can hand those out to everybody at your office. Do you think, do you mind if I film you? Is that okay? I'm live right now. I don't have to film you. We're in a private place.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000]  Yeah, it'd be better that you don't.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:54.000]  Okay, that's fine. That's fine. So, now that you've got your avocados, do you think we can stop human trafficking at the southern border? Do you think we can get the Democrats to come on board with this and stop human trafficking that's happening and the gun running and the drug running?
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:00.000]  Of course, we would like to stop that. Of course, we would like to stop the criminal activity.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:04.000]  So, you're four shutting the border down to stop the criminal activity?
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:14.000]  I'm four shutting the border down. I'm four stopping human trafficking and illegal activities.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:20.000]  But that's happening at a high rate right now. It's like, worst ever.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:27.000]  I'm not sure that we completely agree with each other, but we do agree.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:36.000]  Oh, that's all right. Don't worry, I got some avocados for you guys. See, you guys can do whatever you want with those.
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:41.000]  Do you think now that you've got, because people were saying if we shut the border down, that they'll run out of avocados.
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:48.000]  So now that you guys got avocados, can we agree to shut the border down to end human trafficking? Do you think we can do that? No?
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:53.000]  So keep the border open, keep the human trafficking going? Well, no, they're two separate issues.
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:03:00.000]  But they're not, because the human trafficking happens at the southern border. It happens all over, so...
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:08.000]  Excuse me, are you sure you're with us? I'm going for you with Info Wars. Hi, it's nice to meet you. Yeah, so we don't agree with you.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:13.000]  So you want to keep the border wide open, the human trafficking and the drug running and everything keeping going?
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.000]  I'm sorry, could you leave, please? Deadly amounts of fentanyl?
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:26.000]  Sure, I can leave. So we can't agree, though. We're going to keep the border wide open and keep the human trafficking going and the drug running and the fentanyl and the guns and everything.
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000]  We want to hear your talking points. Would you like to leave, please?
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:35.000]  No, no, that's not a talking point. You can look that up for yourself. And yeah, it's kind of funny I bring you avocados. It's the avocado challenge.
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:41.000]  But I'm trying to raise awareness for human trafficking at the southern border. So you guys are okay that that's happening with the Democrats?
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:49.000]  I'm going to call the police if you'd like. Okay, I'm going to leave. I just want to get it on record that you guys here at the Democrat headquarters in Austin are okay with human trafficking at the southern border.
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:53.000]  So you are okay with human trafficking at the southern border? We did not say that.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:58.000]  Well, can we stop it then? Can we shut down the southern border and stop it?
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:04.000]  Okay, so you guys okay? Alright, so you're kicking me out because I want to stop human trafficking at the southern border? That's what you're doing here today?
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:16.000]  Alright, well, millions of people are going to see this and know that this happened. Okay, so millions of people are going to know that the local Democrats in Austin are going to have wide open borders and have human trafficking happening.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:28.000]  Yeah, that's sad, ladies and gentlemen. That's sad. So there you go. So I had a feeling it would go something like this as they've now officially kicked me out.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:35.000]  So I thought we could come together out here to end human trafficking at the southern border. I mean, the human trafficking is out of control, folks.
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:42.000]  Children are being trafficked. Think about that. Children. Children are being trafficked at the southern border.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:49.000]  More than half the women that come across the southern border illegally are raped on their journey to get here. It is a crisis.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:59.000]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen. I tried to give the Democrats an avocado so we could do something about human trafficking. They wouldn't do it.
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:08.000]  I want to say Brain Force is great. I want to say Turbo Force is amazing. It is. But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:11.000]  The fish oil is better than it. And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:20.000]  Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there. You've got the children's, you've got the adults, you've got the krill oil.
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:26.000]  If you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are really strong. They don't give you the burpees, but krill oil is the best.
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:30.000]  And it'll give you the damn burps. And I'm sorry. You want something like this, you don't get stuff for free.
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:35.000]  The krill is hallucinogenic. It's so good. In my view. I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:41.000]  I eat five capillots of krill oil before I go to bed. I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:48.000]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:06:09.000]  So we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you. I just can't do it.
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:24.000]  Thank you for joining us again. I'm Alex Jones. We're about to go back to Owen Shroyer, host of the broadcast live.
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.000]  But if you were listening the last hour, you had a chance to hear it.
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:45.000]  If you just tuned in, this big nationwide firestorm over AOC slowing down her voice to half speed and trying to put on a weird southern black accent is so illustrative of how these people are shapeshifters.
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:59.000]  The globalists are crafting everything they do. They're so inauthentic. They're so fake that they always go so far and they're scripting that they try to even pick up local colloquial mannerisms.
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:06.000]  Which if you do have the real world works, people don't like. People like something that's different and authentic and that's real.
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:15.000]  But again, these globalists fall into deception and lies not because it makes them successful, but because they come from deception. They're bad people.
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:23.000]  Then they organize into criminal groups to go out and try to dominate and control society. But that's why they always lose in the end.
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:31.000]  Tyranny always blooms like an infection. It always grows and grows until the body politic awakens and turns against it.
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:39.000]  But a lot of times hundreds of millions end up dying in the process. AOC is cancer. Beto is cancer.
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:48.000]  Bernie Sanders is not swindling colleges and driving $100,000 cars.
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:59.000]  On private jets and million dollar homes, he's telling you again, capitalism is bad. White people don't know what it's like to be poor.
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:09.000]  These are dividers. These are frauds that never worked days in their lives. They're the anointed ones born to run, born to lead, born to run your life.
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:17.000]  And they believe they can break your will, but then they get angry and angry as they deplatform. More and more people, more people just fill in that vacuum.
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:23.000]  And then President Trump is tweeting Carpe Doctor videos.
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:29.000]  I love Carpe Doctor. Where do you first get famous? At FullWars.com. Great work he does. Posting his videos.
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:40.000]  He won one of our big contests a few years ago. And now he's had his videos watched. I looked it up. Just on YouTube and Twitter, over 100 million times the last three months.
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:46.000]  And of course, Brian Stelzer's saying, this can't be allowed. What are we going to do?
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:56.000]  Because no one wants to watch that little fake dirtbag acting official, like Humpty Dumpty with 100,000 viewers.
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:01.000]  Gardening shows in New York City have 100,000 listeners.
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:15.000]  These people are legends in their own mind. But the big corporate chief, like Zucker, who sits back and watches these shows that are produced for him, it makes him feel like his message is being put out professionally.
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:26.000]  And carried out by a bunch of foundation trained, leftist CIA operatives, who has another big filthy spoon in his mouth, telling you about class warfare all day.
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:33.000]  I mean, you know about Anderson Cooper, right? He's worth billions and billions and billions of dollars given to him by his robber baron families.
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:38.000]  Oh, that's right. He's the heir to the Vanderbilt fortune and several others.
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:46.000]  But if you search into that, it's all these fake Esquire articles about he, he, he doesn't own any of the money. He gave it all away.
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:53.000]  And he's a self-made man. No, he put it in a tax-free foundation, just like Bill and Melinda Gates do, just like Warren Buffett does.
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:56.000]  It's like the royal family of England does and the royal Dutch family.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:00.000]  They put their money in tax-free foundations because it means they're tax-free.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:07.000]  So their castles and helicopters are all free, and then they can put all their money towards political takeovers and government deals.
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:14.000]  You don't think George Soros actually has given the four billion dollars in the last few years to break our borders and set up UN refugee centers.
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:23.000]  He gets the State Department money, he skims off the top, and then he's the philanthropist that gives the invaders $3,000 debit cards. That's right.
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:35.000]  So again, they're all the ultra-rich. They're trying to destroy the free market in the middle class so that they have a giant poor underclass like Mexico or other areas as a tool of feudalistic control.
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:49.000]  Learn about feudalism. Learn about how feudalism has always been used as political systems from Japan to ancient Europe to keep 90% of people in total poverty and near starvation so they don't get too uppity.
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:57.000]  That's how kings and so-called nobles dominate. So the globalists haven't invented this system. They've just brought it back in a high tech way.
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:06.000]  All right, let's go back live to Owen Schreuder and the ATX. I'm Alex Jones, NewsWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, tomorrow's news today.
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:12.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're back here live in the InfoWars World headquarters. Owen Schreuder filling in for Alex Jones.
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:24.000]  We've got multiple breaking news stories developing right now, and I've got tons of news that I'm going to cover now for the remainder of this hour before Carpe D'Octem joins me in the third hour.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:36.000]  And then Will Johnson takes over in the fourth hour, and then I'll be back hosting the War Room from 3 to 6 p.m. at Infowars.com slash show, and I'm going to dedicate those three hours to taking your phone calls.
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:46.000]  So if there's something that's on your mind that you were aching to call into the Alex Jones show today, go ahead and just wait till the War Room starts and we'll open up the phone lines then.
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:58.000]  In the meantime, though, I want to do a couple of just check off a couple of boxes here for today's agenda before I move on to the news.
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:12.000]  Now, I've told you about InfowarsStore.com. I am currently giving it a trial run today, drinking the Turbo Force hot like tea and just kind of sipping on it, sustaining me throughout the broadcast.
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:25.000]  So far, I have to say that Will Johnson was right, and that is a good alternative to just hitting the Turbo Force in one chug and getting the immediate energy burst that lasts for hours.
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:35.000]  Instead, you can sit here and sustain and just kind of sip on it for a couple hours if you must. I mean, I've been sipping on it for about 10, 15 minutes now and not even halfway through.
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:45.000]  I'm definitely getting the energy, but not in the rush that you get from it when you just chug it down. But that's Turbo Force at InfowarsStore.com, very popular.
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:13:01.000]  Other popular supplements are all at InfowarsStore.com, bodies. In fact, right now, a lot of people are tweeting me their shipments that they just got from our super sale that's happening right now where you've got 60% off top selling
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:11.000]  supplements like bodies, Brain Force Plus, free shipping store-wide, the spring super sale. And people are just tweeting at me pictures of their shipments that they just got in.
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:25.000]  Boxes of bodies and Brain Force and Turbo Force, and we send you a page of stickers and everything that you can put on your cell phone or, you know, put at the public commons at your university or your school.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:40.000]  So it's all possible with your support at InfowarsStore.com. And then here's some of the stuff that we like to do besides just the 10 hours of live broadcasting we do every day, the most censorship, most censored news broadcast in the world.
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:48.000]  Yeah, super blue fluoride free toothpaste. People are tweeting at me. In fact, if you want to, I'm one of the last Infowars hosts allowed on Twitter here.
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:14:00.000]  Obviously, Alex gets the full ban. Our live broadcast are totally banned. But if you tweet at me at all I do is Owen, my name is Beto because that's my name. That's who I am. I'm Beto.
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:14.000]  So if you tweet at me, I'll retweet your image. I'll retweet your shipment if it just arrived or your stash of Infowars products today because that just kind of has naturally been what's been happening on my Twitter feed.
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:26.000]  And of course, that was after I did my live feed this morning. You know, I think, no, there's three Democrat offices in Austin. I'm just saying, I'm just saying.
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:36.000]  And I'll also say, I tried to get a bunch of other really influential popular conservatives on Twitter to do this with me today. I think I'm the only one that's done it.
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:48.000]  So that's fine. So maybe I'll just do it again. Maybe I'll just do it again. And then, you know, hey, look, we can make a news headline, folks. We just have to act.
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:15:01.000]  And I get it. People are busy. But if we had 50 people go to Democrat offices and deliver them avocados live stream it and say, Hey, here's your avocados. Can we stop human traffic?
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:10.000]  Of course, it's a joke. It's not about the avocados. That's the point. The point is to raise awareness that there's human trafficking happening at the border and that the Democrats don't want to stop it.
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:19.000]  You just get them to admit it on film and you use the avocados as the joke that they freaked out about to do it. And then you make it go viral and then 50 people do it, 100 people do it.
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:31.000]  And then it's a national news story. And then in 300 years, just like the Boston Tea Party, you have avocado day, but we just don't act as conservatives.
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:47.000]  One thing I will act on as well is stopping Planned Parenthood getting government funding. That's why on May 26th at noon, I'm hosting the stop government funding of Planned Parenthood rally slash protest at the Planned Parenthood in Austin, Texas on 7th Street.
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:56.000]  So be there with me May 26th at noon to stop government funding of Planned Parenthood. I'm taking action. Take action with me. Let's change the world together.
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:21.000]  The Omega 3 fatty acids.
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:27.000]  Black seed, zinc, alfalfa, the digestive enzymes that are cooked out of regular dog food.
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000]  Dinovite is nutrition.
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000]  The shedding is stopped and the itching is stopped.

[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:01.000]  There are thousands of ideologies out there.
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:06.000]  Hundreds of different political systems and most of them are funded by the globalist.
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:09.000]  Infowars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:12.000]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:18.000]  I didn't invent all this. I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana and what really works for humanity,
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000]  and I'm simply trying to bring it back.
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:24.000]  And lo and behold, it's super popular like it's always been.
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:27.000]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately,
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:32.000]  because we have the light in the dark of the night that sends chills at my spine.

[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:26.000]  You are the Resistance. And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:39.000]  Alright, I'm going to get into the breaking news right now.
[01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:45.000]  And then, engage in a total news blitz.
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:54.000]  This has just come across my desk.
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:58.000]  More arrests expected in Colt Case against Smallville Actress.
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:03.000]  So, that's the Nix of them sex cult.
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:13.000]  And that's Allison Mack, who has been cooperating with the investigation on going into that sex cult.
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:26.000]  And she has now admitted to engaging in part of these crimes, including racketeering,
[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:32.000]  but much worse is being alleged and investigated into when it comes to this sex cult.
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:38.000]  And so, this is one of those things that's kind of just been floating out there.
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:43.000]  Because you know there's other people in Hollywood that are involved in this, probably politicians as well.
[01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:47.000]  And the beauty of it is that they branded themselves.
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:52.000]  So, like, if there ever was an investigation and anybody from this sex cult tried to deny it,
[01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:55.000]  just go right to where they brand them.
[01:21:55.000 --> 01:22:00.000]  They say, oh, looks like you were in that sex cult.
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:03.000]  So, who knows what connections that those might have to other Democrats.
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:08.000]  I mean, we already know about Anthony Weiner, who's going to have to register as a sex offender.
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:15.000]  We already saw what came out in the WikiLeaks emails, which led to the pizza gate phenomenon.
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:24.000]  And there have been all other kinds of stuff coming down from this Me Too thing with Matt Lauer and all these other Democrats.
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:29.000]  But it never sticks to them somehow, because the whole purpose of it was not to protect women.
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:35.000]  It was to get Donald Trump and then use that as a weapon to fire against any of their political opponents.
[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:45.000]  But I just wonder what will be the final story when it comes to this next of them sex cult?
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:49.000]  And how deep did this really run in Hollywood?
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:53.000]  And how sorted was the activity really?
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:57.000]  And was this just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to that?
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:00.000]  I mean, let's not forget about Jimmy Savelle, the known pedophile.
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:03.000]  I mean, quite personally, it's kind of like the 9-11 thing.
[01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:06.000]  Like, they sit here and they call you an Islamophobe.
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:12.000]  I'm not the one that said Muslims killed more than 3,000 people on 9-11 and want to murder me and kill the way of life in the West.
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:16.000]  So how am I the Islamophobe? That's what I'm taught to believe.
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000]  So it's like the same thing with Michael Jackson.
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000]  Okay, well, I'm taught to believe he's a big pedophile.
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:25.000]  So yeah, so the top names in the entertainment industry are pedophiles.
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:28.000]  Well, there's something going on there.
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:31.000]  I'm not sure if we know the full truth.
[01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:34.000]  I'm not sure if we'll ever find out the full truth.
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000]  I'm not sure if we want to know the full truth.
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:43.000]  But you just wonder what everything else going on with the deep state coup against the president, with Hollywood involved,
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:51.000]  and then all these arrests happening nationwide, the president's first executive order to stop human trafficking.
[01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:57.000]  It is all connected and it just feels a lot deeper than what's on the surface.
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:09.000]  So that's Allison Mack now who's been cooperating in this investigation into the Nix of him sex cult that's probably going to entangle many members of Hollywood.
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:13.000]  And I would guess even the political establishment.
[01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:17.000]  But that investigation is ongoing.
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:20.000]  Let's get into this stack of news.
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:23.000]  Now, I learned this yesterday.
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:32.000]  It hit me, you know, obviously following the political developments with the Democrat primaries, this Pete Butt judge guy.
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:37.000]  And it's it's so he's from South Bend, Indiana.
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:40.000]  He formerly the mayor and he's he's gay.
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000]  That's his big thing is he's gay.
[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:43.000]  And I didn't even know that.
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000]  And quite frankly, I couldn't care less.
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:51.000]  But originally I was going to go with the nickname butt plug and then I found out he was gay.
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:56.000]  And I realized that media matters would then write a story saying I'm homophobic, which I still encourage you to do.
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:57.000]  I would love that negative press.
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:02.000]  Please call me homophobic because I have no gay friends that will come to my defense.
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:07.000]  But no, we'll just go with butt judge.
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:11.000]  But so he's been kind of just this guy kind of floating around.
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:12.000]  He's kind of charismatic.
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:13.000]  He gets low coverage.
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000]  Now they're kind of pumping him up over here.
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000]  Beto O'Rourke is kind of trending down.
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000]  Kamala Harris is irrelevant.
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:20.000]  Booker's irrelevant.
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000]  Elizabeth Warren's a fake Indian.
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000]  I mean, the list goes on and on.
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:25.000]  Sanders just kind of gets ignored.
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000]  He's just a hatchet man anyway.
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000]  He just wants to steal a bunch of money.
[01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:30.000]  He doesn't want to do anything with it.
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000]  It just enrich himself.
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:37.000]  But then there's Pete Butt judge and it hit me and I said this yesterday.
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:42.000]  He is only here as a gaslight to the president's administration.
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:50.000]  So the whole purpose of this guy's campaign right now is to gaslight Donald Trump
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:54.000]  or his administration into responding to some of the things that he says
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:57.000]  so that then they can attack him for being homophobic.
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000]  And so the latest example comes today.
[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000]  Butt judge to Mike Pence.
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:05.000]  If you got a problem with who I am, your problem is not with me.
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000]  Your coral sir is with my creator.
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:12.000]  So this is him trying to get, again, it's all about getting Republicans or Trump to say something.
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000]  They can say he's homophobic.
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000]  This is all gaslighting.
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000]  Oh, now they're trying to attack his God.
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000]  Say, oh, your God made me gay or whatever.
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:21.000]  It's all gaslighting.
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:27.000]  And the president listens or people in his office just do not respond to this guy.
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000]  Just do not respond to this guy.
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000]  His whole purpose is to get you to respond.
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000]  Do not respond.
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:38.000]  Ignore, ignore, mute, block.
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:39.000]  Do not respond to this guy.
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000]  His whole purpose is to gaslight you.
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000]  Now he's trying to gaslit Pence, gaslight Pence.
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:49.000]  And by the way, Pence, former governor of Indiana,
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:54.000]  Butt judge, mayor of South Bend, they've been friends.
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:55.000]  They've been friendly in the past.
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:59.000]  This is typical politics from Pete Butt judge.
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000]  Don't respond to this gaslighting.
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000]  Don't, and it's going to be all in the media.
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000]  Look out for Butt judge.
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000]  Butt judge a threat to Trump in the Midwest.
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000]  Butt judge a threat to Trump in the Rust Belt.
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:14.000]  No, the only threat he is to you is if you respond.
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:17.000]  In Pete Butt judge, this is from San Francisco gate,
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:20.000]  America deals with a new kind of candidate.
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:21.000]  What, because he's a gay white man?
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000]  No, we just had Obama in the White House.
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:24.000]  Calm down.
[01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:29.000]  After 2016, lost Democrats know they need white male voters.
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:32.000]  Oh, the Associated Press.
[01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:35.000]  Well, too bad you hate white men.
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:38.000]  So they just didn't do the political math right.
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000]  And they didn't get enough illegal immigrants in here, I guess.
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:41.000]  That's why they're pushing so much.
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:45.000]  Elizabeth Warren and Reno, Democrats will need to have more than just
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000]  an anti-Trump message.
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:51.000]  She came sprinting in to this gymnasium.
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:52.000]  Do we have this video?
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:53.000]  I don't know why.
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000]  I just feel like this video could be so valuable.
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:59.000]  Her running.
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:08.000]  Hey, Elizabeth Warren.
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000]  There she is.
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:11.000]  There's Elizabeth.
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000]  Look at her go.
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000]  Wow.
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:16.000]  You know what?
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000]  I'm not going to make a joke any further.
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000]  I could go further.
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:21.000]  I'm not, but there it is.
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:24.000]  There's Elizabeth Warren sprinting into the gym.
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:32.000]  She's just remembering her days at Cherokee High Track Program.
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:35.000]  DeBlasio visits Nevada as he flirts with presidential run.
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:39.000]  Oh, please, DeBlasio, your top intern, a known leading pedophile.
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000]  Yeah, good.
[01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000]  Reality bites Beto after a high-flying kickoff.
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:44.000]  Yeah, people are uninterested.
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000]  But he'll make $100 million in the process.
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:49.000]  Sanders quiets his critics as he becomes 2020 front-runner.
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:52.000]  Still the front-runner, but getting ignored because he's never supposed to win.
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:53.000]  He's just supposed to steal your money.
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:54.000]  He's a socialist.
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:55.000]  Steal your money, cut, and run.
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000]  Leave you high and dry.
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:00.000]  Ooh, get the stinky dog away from me.
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:01.000]  Bad breath and bad gas.
[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:02.000]  PDE stopped eating.
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000]  All of his hair fell out.
[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000]  Itching, licking, missing fur.
[01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000]  At least $5,000 in vet bills.
[01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000]  Crames, antibiotics, sprays.
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:11.000]  No results.
[01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:14.000]  Everything we tried failed except the Dynabyte.
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000]  D-I-N-O-V-I-T-E.
[01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:17.000]  Dot com.
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000]  If you want the dog to be healthy, you gotta feed the company healthy.
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000]  The Omega-3 fatty acids.
[01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:27.000]  Taxi zinc, alfalfa, the digestive enzymes that are cooked out of regular dog food.
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000]  Dynabyte is nutrition.
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000]  The shedding is stopped and the itching is stopped.
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:32.000]  Her coat is not soft.
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:33.000]  It's silky.
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:36.000]  It's healthy and shiny and glossy.
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:37.000]  She's got life.
[01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:38.000]  She's got energy.
[01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:39.000]  Tons of energy.
[01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:40.000]  No more bad smells.
[01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:41.000]  Dynabyte's the mom.
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:45.000]  Dynabyte is the best thing that's ever happened to my dogs.
[01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000]  You know, besides me, of course.

[01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:41.000]  I'm retweeting all the images that you guys are sending me on Twitter of your infowarslife products.
[01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:44.000]  Thank you guys so much for your support.
[01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:48.000]  I'm just literally going through all of these right now, live on air.
[01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:52.000]  I should probably put it down and stop retweeting and get back to work, so I will right now.
[01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:55.000]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show brought to you by infowarsstore.com.
[01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:58.000]  The most censored news organization in the world is infowars.
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:02.000]  That's why your support at infowarsstore.com is key.
[01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:11.000]  So I'm showing my thanks to everybody today for all your support by retweeting it on my Twitter account at all I do is own.
[01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:12.000]  My name is Beto.
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:18.000]  Of course, that's not my real name, but I'm trying to pander to my Hispanic audience, so call me Beto.
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:24.000]  And I'm retweeting your images that you're sending me from your purchases at infowarsstore.com.
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:32.000]  Now, I want to put a end cap, a butt cap on the end of my Butt Judge coverage here.
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:38.000]  I totally forgot this and do came in in the break and reminded me.
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:46.000]  Pete Butt Judge's dad is a hardcore communist, a hardcore Marxist.
[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:49.000]  And so there's a story highlighted here.
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:58.000]  I'm not sure where he got this, but the headline is Pete Butt Judge's father was a Marxist professor who lauded the communist manifesto.
[01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:04.000]  Yeah, hardcore communist professor, hardcore Marxist.
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000]  I mean hardcore.
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:17.000]  So Pete Butt Judge comes right from the Marxist communist manifesto, and then it's funny because I was stunned by this.
[01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:26.000]  And I don't have a, I'm not sure where this story comes from either, but headline, Mayor Butt Judge runs for president while his city bleeds.
[01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000]  And this is stunning.
[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:40.000]  While Chicago is notorious for its murder rate in 2015, Butt Judge's South Bend actually topped Chicago's 16.4 homicides per 100,000 people with a homicide rate of 16.79 per 100,000 people.
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:47.000]  Those numbers put Mayor Pete Butt Judge's city on top of the list for top 30 murder capitals in the country that year.
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:50.000]  I'd never heard of South Bend when it comes to murder crime.
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:36:02.000]  I mean, it's usually Chicago, St. Louis, East St. Louis, Detroit, but Butt Judge gets another Democrat city right up there on top.
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:03.000]  Isn't it great?
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:06.000]  All these Democrat cities, tops and murder, tops and poverty.
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000]  Gotta love that.
[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:09.000]  This is breaking.
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:13.000]  Trump is removing US Secret Service Director.
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:19.000]  Randolph Tex Ailes is being removed according to CNN.
[01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:24.000]  So you always question it coming from CNN, but this is just breaking right now.
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:29.000]  Of course, Kirsten Nielsen out as DHS Secretary.
[01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:33.000]  And look, I think she did it as good a job as she could.
[01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:36.000]  She was good media appearances and said the right things.
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:45.000]  But as far as the action and results at the border, not good, not good at all.
[01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:49.000]  It's really even worse than ever down there in some ways.
[01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:52.000]  So let me just go right into this stack of news.
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:58.000]  From the Associated Press, Trump struggles with a growing problem on the border.
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:06.000]  Well, Trump's problem is an inherited one from decades, decades long ago that he's actually trying to do something about.
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:15.000]  And so that's the problem and he's got all these stalwarts in his way from the Democrat Party.
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000]  Who knows why they want to keep the border open?
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:18.000]  I mean, there's so many different reasons.
[01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:21.000]  Do they want human trafficking?
[01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:28.000]  Are they just so obsessed with fighting Donald Trump on anything and everything that they want open borders now?
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000]  Because you can play all the Democrats.
[01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:34.000]  I mean, even though Obama years, they campaigned on closing the border for decades.
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:39.000]  They said we have to do something about illegal immigration because it used to be like a working class American thing.
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:40.000]  They're taking American jobs.
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000]  They're affecting the economy negatively.
[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000]  Even Sanders is actually admitting that.
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:50.000]  In fact, let's actually go to Sanders admitting this in a stunning clip, clip 10.
[01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:59.000]  So Bernie now is not for open borders because it is not compatible with the welfare state he wants to create.
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:02.000]  We're going to have open borders on our society today.
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000]  How would you deal with the social services connected?
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000]  I lost my comb.
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000]  Opening the borders such as healthcare.
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000]  Illegal immigrants stole my comb.
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000]  Who do you think is suggesting opening the borders?
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000]  Well, that you're an activist for opening for...
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:15.000]  No, I'm not.
[01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000]  Afraid of me getting your information wrong.
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:18.000]  That is not my view.
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:19.000]  Okay, I apologize.
[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:20.000]  Thank you.
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:24.000]  I think what we need is comprehensive immigration reform.
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:25.000]  That is not simply...
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:26.000]  You're quite right.
[01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:31.000]  If you point as you open the borders, my God, there's a lot of poverty in this world.
[01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000]  And you're going to have people from all over the world.
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:36.000]  And I don't think that's something that we can do at this point.
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:37.000]  Can't do it.
[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000]  So that is not my position.
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000]  What?
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:47.000]  Bernie Sanders is now anti-open borders.
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:51.000]  I'm telling you, the iron is hot.
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:54.000]  And it's time to strike on this issue.
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000]  It's time to take action, folks.
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:59.000]  I'm telling you, it's so stupid.
[01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000]  You know what, I don't even care.
[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:08.000]  I'm just telling you, folks, we could make national news and own this right now if we just take action.
[01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:11.000]  It was my idea to go deliver avocados to a Democrat office and say,
[01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:14.000]  can we do something about the open borders now and stop human trafficking?
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:17.000]  Because they don't know what to do about it.
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:18.000]  The borders are wide open.
[01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000]  They can't deny it.
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:24.000]  Open borders is now a Democrat campaign.
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000]  I mean, but they can't admit it.
[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000]  So you have to force them to admit it.
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:35.000]  And Bernie Sanders is actually smart enough where he's getting ahead of the curb and he's disavowing open borders.
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:46.000]  So see, I'm telling you, folks, this will defeat the Democrats if we can just force them to own this issue.
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:50.000]  And Bernie Sanders is smart enough not to.
[01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000]  The other Democrats aren't yet.
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:53.000]  They haven't figured it out.
[01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:57.000]  So we have to make them own it now before it's too late.
[01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000]  You are the party of open borders.
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:02.000]  You are the party of human trafficking.
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:05.000]  You are the party of illegal immigration.
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:10.000]  I guess Sanders' credit when he's smart, he knows what he's saying.
[01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:13.000]  He's right. Disavow the open borders.
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:19.000]  But see, Sanders is actually being honest because he knows he's calling for total socialism.
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:26.000]  And if we import the third world, that socialism will be totally collapsed.
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000]  But you heard the guy questioning Bernie.
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000]  He's like, well, what do you mean you're not for open borders?
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000]  Folks, the Democrats are the open border party.
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000]  Do not let them slip out of that.
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:41.000]  Do not let these snakes slip out of their open border policies because they hate Trump so much.
[01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:46.000]  Do not let these snake, slimy Democrats slip out of the fact.
[01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000]  They opened the borders.
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000]  They're the ones that want millions of illegals coming here.
[01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000]  They're the ones that want disease pouring in.
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:55.000]  They're the ones that want human trafficking.
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:41:02.000]  You need to make them own this issue now because like the sneaky, slimy, slithery snakes they are,
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:08.000]  they will find a way to wiggle out of this and the media will be there to protect them.
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:13.000]  And Bernie's already putting out the talking points before the rest of them saying immigration reform,
[01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:17.000]  comprehensive immigration reform, not open borders, not open borders.
[01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:20.000]  No, no, no, not open borders, just comprehensive reform.
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000]  You know what comprehensive reform is?
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:25.000]  Shut it down.
[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000]  Shut it down.
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:30.000]  They say, oh, we'll take all the guns away if it saves one kid's life.
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:37.000]  We'll stop all the damn open border illegal immigration to save 100 kids' lives for being human trafficked.
[01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000]  Excuse me.
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:44.000]  So that's the problem that Trump has at the southern border.
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:50.000]  Trump administration nearly doubles H2B guest visa program, which brings many Mexican workers.
[01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:54.000]  Trump has actually, there's been more people coming in this country since Trump got elected.
[01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:55.000]  They say he's racist.
[01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:58.000]  Trump has put out more H2B visas.
[01:41:58.000 --> 01:41:59.000]  He put out more visas.
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:05.000]  He's done more for comprehensive immigration reform and they say, oh, no, he's racist.
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000]  But it's failing.
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:10.000]  And that's why Kirsten Nielsen has resigned.
[01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:15.000]  And now Kevin Mechelinen has replaced him.
[01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:20.000]  Scrutiny and suspicion as Mueller report undergoes redaction.
[01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000]  So this is just straight up fake news.
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:25.000]  Oh, by the way, here's more fake news, though, from CBS.
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:28.000]  Resigns after clashes with Trump on immigration.
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:32.000]  The clashes are that there's not a good result from Nielsen, so it's time for somebody else.
[01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:36.000]  But MSN, scrutiny and suspicion as Mueller report undergoes redaction.
[01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:39.000]  Yeah, duh, they have to redact some of this report.
[01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:44.000]  It's the law written by Democrats, but they spin the headline to make you think they're trying to hide something.
[01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000]  More fake news from CNN.
[01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:51.000]  Tax refunds so far this year are down by $6 billion from 2018 to make it act like taxes have gone up.
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:54.000]  But they admit in the article, this is because taxes are down.
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:57.000]  People are paying less taxes, just like Trump promised.
[01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:00.000]  There are thousands of ideologies out there.
[01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000]  Hundreds of different political systems.
[01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:05.000]  And most of them are funded by the globalist.
[01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:09.000]  Infowars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:12.000]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000]  They needn't invent all this.
[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:18.000]  I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana, and what really works for humanity,
[01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000]  and I'm simply trying to bring it back.
[01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:23.000]  And lo and behold, it's super popular like it's always been.
[01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:27.000]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately,
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:32.000]  because we have the light in the dark of the night that sends chills up my spine.
[01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:35.000]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and Infowars
[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:38.000]  by buying the great products at infowarsstore.com,
[01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000]  by spreading the articles, by spreading the videos,
[01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:43.000]  by praying for this operation and for praying for this nation
[01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000]  and the world for peace and discernment.
[01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:48.000]  For myself and the whole Infowars family,
[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000]  I want to thank all of you for what you've done,
[01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:53.000]  because without you, Infowars is nothing.
[01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:57.000]  You are the Infowars, and I salute you.
[01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:02.000]  The globalists, the eugenicists are always talking down to us.
[01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:06.000]  They're always trying to make us feel small, to feel insignificant.
[01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:10.000]  They try to censor because they fear you and don't want you to have the right
[01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:14.000]  to access information so you can make your own decisions.
[01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:17.000]  They want you to believe you're powerless.
[01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:22.000]  But the truth is, it is we the people and our ideas and our actions
[01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:25.000]  and what we say and what we do that changes the world.
[01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000]  We are the power structure.
[01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:30.000]  We are the inventors. We are the trailblazers.
[01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:34.000]  And the globalists understand that,
[01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:38.000]  and they understand that they are basically trying to control
[01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:41.000]  and steal the future from we the people.
[01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000]  Now, to help fund our operation,
[01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:46.000]  there's undoubtedly the very tip of the spear against these globalists.
[01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000]  I want to encourage listeners and viewers to understand
[01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:51.000]  that throughout the second half of the month of March,

[01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:03.000]  The globalists, the eugenicists are always talking down to us.
[01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:07.000]  They're always trying to make us feel small to feel insignificant.
[01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:10.000]  They try to censor because they fear you
[01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:13.000]  and don't want you to have the right to access information
[01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000]  so you can make your own decisions.
[01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:18.000]  They want you to believe you're powerless.
[01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:22.000]  But the truth is, it is we the people and our ideas and our actions
[01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:26.000]  and what we say and what we do that changes the world.
[01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000]  We are the power structure.
[01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:31.000]  We are the inventors. We are the trailblazers.
[01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:35.000]  And the globalists understand that.
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:39.000]  And they understand that they are basically trying to control
[01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:42.000]  and steal the future from we the people.
[01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000]  Now, to help fund our operation,
[01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:47.000]  there's undoubtedly the very tip of the spear against these globalists.
[01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000]  I want to encourage listeners and viewers to understand
[01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:52.000]  that throughout the second half of the month of March,
[01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000]  we're going to have store-wide free shipping

[01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000]  The spring super sale happening right now
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:00.000]  up to 60% off InfoWars life supplements
[01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000]  at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:06.000]  60% off bodies, 60% off brain force plus
[01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000]  two top-rated top sellers.
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:09.000]  I mean, the best.
[01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000]  I'm kind of a seasonal swimmer,
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:15.000]  and I just took my first swim over the weekend.
[01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:21.000]  And so I probably hadn't swum in...
[01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000]  definitely since last year.
[01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000]  So I was a little sore coming out of there.
[01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000]  You know, you worked from different muscles,
[01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:30.000]  your leg muscles, and there was a little soreness.
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000]  And I took the bodies.
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000]  Next day, soreness gone.
[01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:35.000]  Just amazing.
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000]  And that's how it always is with the bodies.
[01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:40.000]  And for people that work, you know,
[01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:44.000]  very laborious jobs, hauling stuff,
[01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000]  building things, carpenters,
[01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:49.000]  people that work in a kitchen on their feet all day,
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:55.000]  they are some of the biggest consumers of bodies
[01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000]  because they get the achiness in the knees,
[01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000]  they get the achiness in the back and everything,
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:00.000]  and then the arm.
[01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:03.000]  And the bodies just helps them so much.
[01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:06.000]  I have taken so many calls on the war room for this,
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:07.000]  which, by the way, we're not going to have time
[01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000]  for phone calls today on the Alex Jones show.
[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000]  So what I'm going to do,
[01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:12.000]  pulling a double duty here today,
[01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:13.000]  hosting the war room,
[01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:17.000]  I'm going to dedicate all three hours to your phone calls.
[01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000]  So if you stick around at infowars.com
[01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000]  slash show and tune into the war room,
[01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000]  I'm going to dedicate all three hours
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000]  of today's war room to taking your calls.
[01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:26.000]  Now, in the meantime, though,
[01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000]  as I'm sipping on my turbo force here,
[01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:31.000]  consumed warm Will Johnson style,
[01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000]  who by the way,
[01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:39.000]  sorry, I just had to get a sip of my turbo force there.
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:43.000]  I want to give a big shout out to Paloma for Trump.
[01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:46.000]  I did not know that that was her in the video
[01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000]  that I made a big deal of yesterday.
[01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000]  And it's funny because I did know it
[01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:51.000]  because I recognized her voice
[01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000]  because I've talked to her so many times.
[01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:56.000]  And she's just such an electrifying patriot.
[01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:04.000]  But it's just so funny because it's like,
[01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:08.000]  I just wish people understood the power of action.
[01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000]  And of course it was Paloma for Trump
[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000]  that made that viral video.
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000]  She is an electrifying patriot.
[01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:17.000]  That woman has so much power.
[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:20.000]  And there's so many out there like her that are dormant,
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000]  that are just waiting,
[01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:25.000]  waiting to be on fire,
[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:29.000]  waiting to stand up for truth and righteousness.
[01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000]  And so I salute Paloma for Trump.
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000]  I wish I would have,
[01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:36.000]  and honestly, folks, it's because I'm so inundated with stuff.
[01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000]  Some things do tend to get through the cracks,
[01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:39.000]  and that was one of them.
[01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000]  I meant to send her a message to get her on the show,
[01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000]  and then it just slipped through the cracks.
[01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000]  And I sent her a message.
[01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:46.000]  So she may come on.
[01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000]  She was on with Will Johnson earlier.
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000]  And she's got her own Facebook page, Paloma for Trump.
[01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:54.000]  She's always active, just totally just kicks ass.
[01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000]  And that's the thing about people like Paloma for Trump.
[01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:00.000]  She just lowers her head down and just has total victory.
[01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000]  And it's like she doesn't even turn around as looking
[01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000]  and see who's watching.
[01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:05.000]  That's what I love about her.
[01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000]  That's what we need more people like that.
[01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:08.000]  They aren't in it for the fame.
[01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000]  They're not in it for the likes.
[01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:11.000]  They're not in it for the clicks.
[01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:12.000]  They're in it to win it.
[01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:17.000]  And they know if you build it, they will come.
[01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000]  Or what's the Mandela effect?
[01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:20.000]  If you build it, they will come.
[01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:21.000]  When you build it, they will come.
[01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:22.000]  Field of Dreams.
[01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:26.000]  But let me get into some other news here.
[01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000]  Let's get into some cultural news.
[01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:34.000]  US anti-abortion film, a surprise box office success.
[01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000]  I'm not that surprised.
[01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:40.000]  Unplanned has done great in box offices.
[01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000]  And it was also a success.
[01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:47.000]  Dr. Gosnell, the other anti-abortion film that highlighted
[01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000]  all the murders Dr. Gosnell had.
[01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000]  They had to pull that from theaters.
[01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:52.000]  It was too successful.
[01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:58.000]  So the pro-life movement is just kind of up and coming here
[01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:01.000]  in the culture wars.
[01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:05.000]  And I'm engaged because this is like an easy victory.
[01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:06.000]  This is like hitting a layup.
[01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:11.000]  This is like an alley-oop, slam dunk to win a Super Bowl,
[01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:15.000]  to stand up for innocent children being aborted.
[01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:18.000]  And I get the political nature of it and everything.
[01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000]  And there's obviously instances.
[01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:24.000]  And there's going to be touchy things.
[01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:27.000]  The baby could kill the mother if the woman was raped.
[01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:30.000]  But those are a small percentage of the abortions.
[01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:34.000]  And those are still not abortions that we should celebrate.
[01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:35.000]  But that's what the left does.
[01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000]  They literally celebrate abortion.
[01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:41.000]  And they celebrate the fact that we have this sexualized culture.
[01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000]  And so people go out and have a bunch of sex
[01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000]  and then don't think of the repercussions
[01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:49.000]  because, oh, I can just abort my kid.
[01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:53.000]  It's really an odd thing.
[01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:56.000]  It's really something I don't, honestly,
[01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000]  I can't comprehend it on so many different levels.
[01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:03.000]  But what I can comprehend is the clear and easy choice,
[01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:06.000]  which is to stand for innocent, unborn babies.
[01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:10.000]  And to say, no, just because you don't want that kid
[01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000]  doesn't mean you have the right to kill it.
[01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000]  If you didn't want the kid,
[01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:21.000]  you shouldn't have engaged in activities that lead to a kid.
[01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:25.000]  But that's why on May 26th at noon,
[01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:28.000]  I'm hosting a stop government funding of Planned Parenthood
[01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:33.000]  rally slash protest in Austin, Texas, May 26th at noon.
[01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000]  The Planned Parenthood on 7th Street.
[01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:36.000]  I'm going to be there.
[01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:37.000]  We're going to have hundreds of people there.
[01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:38.000]  We're going to bring signs.
[01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000]  Last time we did this, we had a good time.
[01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:41.000]  We had food.
[01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:42.000]  We had music.
[01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:43.000]  We had camaraderie.
[01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:44.000]  We did live streams.
[01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:47.000]  And we made a big scene there
[01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:50.000]  because there's thousands of people that drove by.
[01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000]  And so now we're going to a different location
[01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:53.000]  and we're going to do the same thing.
[01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:54.000]  Hope you can be there.
[01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000]  It's over Memorial Day weekend.
[01:53:56.000 --> 01:54:00.000]  We're also going to do a flag lay at the Texas State Cemetery
[01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:03.000]  at 10 a.m. that morning, too, if you want to join us for that.
[01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:07.000]  But I'm teaming up with a local veterans organizer here
[01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000]  that we're going to team up with that.
[01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:12.000]  And then we're going to go and do the Planned Parenthood protest
[01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:16.000]  at noon, May 26th at the Planned Parenthood in Austin
[01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000]  and on 7th Street.
[01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:19.000]  All right.
[01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:22.000]  Sacramento wants to tax soda, tires, guns, water,
[01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:26.000]  pain pills, lawyers, car batteries, et cetera, et cetera,
[01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:27.000]  from the LA Times.
[01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000]  It's funny because they always want to tax this stuff,
[01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:32.000]  tax your soda until you can't drink a big soda, whatever.
[01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:37.000]  But all of these things are already taxed.
[01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000]  It's like the same thing with property tax.
[01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000]  You bought something, you paid the tax,
[01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000]  and now you have to keep paying the tax?
[01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:48.000]  Or you die and Trump didn't end the death tax.
[01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000]  I think he basically made it like a loophole
[01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000]  and so you don't have to pay it.
[01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:56.000]  But I'm pretty sure it was still in law.
[01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:00.000]  I mean, how can California, I mean, it's like the same thing.
[01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:05.000]  California tax, the tax is the agriculture industry
[01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:06.000]  out of California.
[01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000]  And then they sit here and they say, oh my gosh,
[01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:11.000]  we have to get avocados from Mexico
[01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000]  because they can't grow up in California.
[01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:16.000]  Yeah, because of all the regulations you got down there.
[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:19.000]  You're too busy protecting cockroaches, literally,
[01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000]  and rats.
[01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:28.000]  They write legislation to protect cockroaches and rats.
[01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:33.000]  The silverfish, and I think it was the kangaroo rat.
[01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:37.000]  Because, you know, people getting water and food,
[01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000]  well, that's just global warming.
[01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:42.000]  But a kangaroo rat or a damn cockroach,
[01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:48.000]  that's what the Democrats in California are concerned with.
[01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:51.000]  This is San Francisco making a living
[01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000]  from your billionaire neighbor's trash.
[01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000]  So this is where San Francisco's gone to.
[01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:59.000]  You have the billionaires and then you have everyone else.
[01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000]  That sucks off the billionaires.
[01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:02.000]  But here's the thing they don't understand,
[01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:03.000]  the same thing with taxes.
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000]  When you add all of these taxes,
[01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000]  you're only creating more poverty.
[01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:10.000]  The middle class and the poor people can't afford the taxes,
[01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:14.000]  so now they're all poor, the rich can afford all the taxes.
[01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000]  Or the rich can put their money overseas,
[01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000]  or the rich can hire accountants and CPAs
[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000]  that know how to get around taxes,
[01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000]  so the rich don't pay the damn taxes.
[01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000]  It's the poor people to do.
[01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:25.000]  But that's what the Democrats love,
[01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:26.000]  because you know what happens?
[01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000]  When the Democrats tax someone into poverty,
[01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:31.000]  they get a new Democrat voter.
[01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000]  Ooh, but that formula's waning,
[01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:36.000]  and that's why they need wide open borders and new voters.
[01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000]  But now in San Francisco, people are just hanging out
[01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000]  outside of the billionaire's place,
[01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000]  waiting for them to throw away some trash,
[01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000]  because, you know, their trash is more valuable
[01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:48.000]  than anything the middle poverty class owns in California.
[01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000]  That's what Democrats do to California.
[01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:51.000]  Here we go.
[01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000]  British mum arrested in Dubai
[01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:57.000]  for calling ex-husband's wife a horse on Facebook.
[01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:01.000]  Okay, so, you know, free speech is dead.
[01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:06.000]  Find $55,000 for calling a male a male.
[01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:09.000]  This is unbelievable.
[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:12.000]  So if you call someone the wrong pronoun,
[01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:17.000]  you are now getting fined in different parts of the world.
[01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:21.000]  Canadian tribunal finds Bill Watkut
[01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:25.000]  $55,000 for expressing Christian views on transgenderism.
[01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:29.000]  I shouldn't laugh because it's sad, but, I mean,
[01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000]  that's what's going on.
[01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:35.000]  But in the meantime, Amy Schumer is now doing ads
[01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:36.000]  for Gillette Venus.
[01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:37.000]  Have you seen this?
[01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:43.000]  Amy Schumer, folks, the new ad woman for Gillette Venus.
[01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:46.000]  There she is. Look at Amy. Look at her go.
[01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:49.000]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:50.000]  Go ahead.
[01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000]  I just have to say something, man.
[01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast,
[01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:55.000]  you're bragging.
[01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000]  It just gets old now.
[01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000]  I'm going to shut you down right now, okay?
[01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:04.000]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings
[01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000]  trying to shut us down?
[01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:09.000]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:12.000]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000]  I mean, what's it going to take us being shut down?
[01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:17.000]  You know what?
[01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:18.000]  I'll put him on pause again.
[01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:21.000]  Hey, Frank, do you understand it's not bragging
[01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000]  to say we are the tip of the spear.
[01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:24.000]  We're under attack.
[01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:25.000]  We need your help.
[01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:28.000]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills
[01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:29.000]  and grow in the face of this.
[01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000]  I'm not going to just stop growth
[01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:32.000]  and let them start pushing us backwards.
[01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:33.000]  You understand?
[01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:34.000]  I need your help, Frank.
[01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000]  I need your help, Frank.
[01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:39.000]  Go to infowarstore.com right now
[01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:42.000]  and help fund the info war.
[01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:43.000]  Do you understand?
[01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:44.000]  I need your help, Frank.
[01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:47.000]  Free press needs your help, Frank.
[01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:48.000]  It's simple.
[01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000]  If you want to beat the globalist,
[01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:51.000]  if you want to take on the new world order,
[01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:54.000]  I'm not doing Bitcoin pumping dumps with Jack Dorsey.
[01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:57.000]  I'm not sitting here selling you cancer cures.
[01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:58.000]  I'm not sitting here, you know,
[01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000]  selling you late term abortion and all the great it is.
[01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:03.000]  I just go out and say, what is the top heart pill?
[01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:04.000]  What is the top tumor?
[01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000]  It's the best seller because it's anti-inflammatory,
[01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000]  and what's the best lab in the country?
[01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:09.000]  Okay, they're the highest rated.
[01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000]  I'm like, you're only 50% curcuminoid?
[01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000]  Well, yeah, they only put $5 product and bottle,
[01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000]  but that's still incredible, sir.
[01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:18.000]  I'm like, what's the highest you could do a month later?
[01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:19.000]  90, 95%.
[01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:20.000]  No one's ever done it.
[01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000]  I said, how much does that cost for a bottle?
[01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:23.000]  That costs $10.
[01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000]  No one's ever done that, sir.
[01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000]  The average competitor is 3% to 5%.
[01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:28.000]  The top brand is 50%.
[01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:31.000]  I'm like, we're going to have 95% curcuminoid.
[01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000]  I mean, you understand why?
[01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:34.000]  That's like our information is explosive.
[01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:35.000]  Our fish oil.
[01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000]  I go out and I get the cleanest, the best.
[01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:38.000]  My children take it.
[01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000]  You think I'm going to give you fish oil?
[01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000]  That isn't the very damn best on my soul?
[01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000]  You think I'm going to screw somebody over
[01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:45.000]  like one of these devil worshipers?
[01:59:45.000 --> 02:00:09.000]  NeverInForcer.com.
[02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:40.000]  All right, I'm about to be joined by Total Meme Legend.
[02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:47.000]  And we have a kind of a I-70 connection in a different timeline,
[02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:51.000]  in a different multiverse, in a different dimension.
[02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:57.000]  But Carpe Dongtum has become meme legend in the course of the last year.
[02:00:57.000 --> 02:01:01.000]  And now every meme he puts out is solid gold.
[02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000]  And it's getting a lot of attention from the White House,
[02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:10.000]  which then is causing mass flooding of liberal tears in your local blue area.
[02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000]  So we got a couple new ones from Carpe Dongtum,
[02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000]  but he's going to join me in the next segment.
[02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:17.000]  But first, let's go to one of his latest here,
[02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:23.000]  where Brian Stelter was triggered by the latest Carpe Dongtum meme.
[02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000]  Well, here's what Biden is up against.
[02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000]  Here's how it may keep coming back and back and back.
[02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:32.000]  This is a meme that was created by a semi-anonymous man from Kansas City,
[02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000]  he posted it, and then the Trump world posted it,
[02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:37.000]  and then the president himself posted it on Twitter.
[02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.000]  It's Biden fondling himself.
[02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000]  Now on one level, it's just about the meme.
[02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:44.000]  On another level, this is how politics has waged this thing.
[02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000]  These are the meme wars in action.
[02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000]  Do you think Democrats understand what they're up against?
[02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000]  Because there was a Mother Jones headline the other day,
[02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:53.000]  saying the right-wing media machine is much more effective
[02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000]  at this kind of visual communication,
[02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000]  and the Democrats aren't even trying.
[02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000]  They can't even speak the language.
[02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000]  I can't breathe in this thing!
[02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:28.000]  Ludicrous speed! Go!
[02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000]  Look at how serious Brian is.
[02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:44.000]  Yes, Brian.
[02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:45.000]  Focus.
[02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000]  Focus, Brian.
[02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:51.000]  My brains are going into my feet!
[02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:04.000]  You can't always get what you want.
[02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000]  Space don't work.
[02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:11.000]  But if you try something, you might find it.
[02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000]  You get what you need.
[02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000]  Stop this thing!
[02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000]  We can't stop.
[02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000]  It's too dangerous.
[02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000]  We've got to slow down this.
[02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:22.000]  Focus, Brian.
[02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000]  Focus.
[02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:25.000]  Focus.
[02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.000]  You can figure it out, Brian.
[02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000]  You can solve the riddle.
[02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:36.000]  You guys, just go back if you can to the freeze frame.
[02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:40.000]  Anyone, a frame of Brian, trying to focus and understand.
[02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000]  I'm telling you.
[02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000]  I'm telling you.
[02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000]  I will understand this.
[02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000]  I'm telling you.
[02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000]  Memology.
[02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000]  And this is like...
[02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:55.000]  I'm telling you, Democrats, liberals, Brian Stelter.
[02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:58.000]  It's like, we're all sitting at a dinner table,
[02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:01.000]  and we're speaking a different language,
[02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000]  and laughing, and having a good time,
[02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:06.000]  and cheers-ing, and Stelter, and Democrats,
[02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:09.000]  and liberal and progressives are over there like,
[02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:12.000]  what? Why are they laughing?
[02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000]  Why do I feel like they're laughing at me?
[02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000]  What are they saying? What is going on?
[02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000]  Stop it! We must stop this language!
[02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000]  Silence this language!
[02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000]  This language should be illegal!
[02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000]  But no one's silencing it, so then they're like,
[02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000]  well, this language is obviously extremist!
[02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:29.000]  This language is obviously racist!
[02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000]  Where now they're saying,
[02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:34.000]  they're literally claiming
[02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:39.000]  that white nationalists adopt clown as their next racist symbol.
[02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:45.000]  I mean, these people are memeing themselves.
[02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000]  They don't speak the language,
[02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:50.000]  but Carpe Donctham has mastered the language.
[02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000]  He joins me next on the other side.
[02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000]  Don't worry, Brian Stelter won't understand
[02:04:54.000 --> 02:05:04.000]  the next segment.
[02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:27.000]  We've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000]  We're basically selling these at cost
[02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.000]  because there was a big overhaul.
[02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:34.000]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews
[02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:35.000]  for yourself.
[02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:37.000]  I've got two in my home.
[02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:40.000]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:43.000]  with the Elecsecure Breeze in your house.
[02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:47.000]  Don't live in a polluted major city in your home.
[02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:48.000]  Have clean air.
[02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000]  Go to InfoWars stores,
[02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:54.000]  live from the InfoWars.com studios.
[02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:57.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:05:57.000 --> 02:06:02.000]  And now your host, Owen Shroyer.
[02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000]  I got something!
[02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000]  I got something!
[02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000]  I got something!
[02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000]  I got something!
[02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000]  I got something!
[02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000]  I got something!
[02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000]  I got something!
[02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000]  I got something!
[02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000]  I got something!
[02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000]  You are the enemy of the people.
[02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000]  Get out of here.
[02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000]  Get out of here.
[02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000]  Get out of here.
[02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000]  Go home to Mommy.
[02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000]  Bye.
[02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000]  Go home to Mommy.
[02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000]  Go home to Mommy.
[02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:40.000]  Tell her to tuck you in bed.
[02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000]  He's such a nice guy.
[02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:46.000]  You know, I can't tell if I've reached peak maturity
[02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:50.000]  by the fact that I enjoy this video so much
[02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000]  or if perhaps I'm trending in the wrong direction.
[02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.000]  Get out of here.
[02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000]  But I blame Carpe Doctor.
[02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.000]  The fact that...
[02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:02.000]  Cammie, what is this?
[02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:05.000]  If you're a radio listener, it's the latest Carpe Doctor meme.
[02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.000]  It's just a little 30-second hit.
[02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000]  And I guess it's like a...
[02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:12.000]  What is that? Like a turkey or something?
[02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000]  It's some yard bird
[02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.000]  puffing up on this dog.
[02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:19.000]  And it's like a Jack Russell Terrier dog.
[02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:22.000]  And it looks like some form of yard bird.
[02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000]  And it just starts chasing after the dog
[02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000]  and the dog's running away
[02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000]  and the bird's getting all big,
[02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.000]  fluffing up its chest and feathers.
[02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000]  And it's got Trump's head on it.
[02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000]  It's just chasing this dog around the yard
[02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000]  and it's a CNN dog.
[02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000]  It's got a CNN logo on the dog.
[02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000]  Just listen.
[02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000]  He's such a nice guy.
[02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000]  Get out of here.
[02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000]  Get out of here.
[02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.000]  Get out of here.
[02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.000]  Alright, so there it is.
[02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000]  So thanks Carpe Doctor
[02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:56.000]  for taking my maturity level down
[02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000]  a couple notches today
[02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000]  with your Benny Hill theme
[02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.000]  Trump yard bird chasing a dog.
[02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000]  Totally brilliant.
[02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000]  You teased this one
[02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000]  and you did not disappoint.
[02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000]  So did you just find this video?
[02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:14.000]  What made you come up with this idea
[02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:18.000]  to have the yard bird Trump chasing around the CNN dog?
[02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:22.000]  I saw it on James Wood's feed
[02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000]  a couple hours before.
[02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000]  I just thought it'd be funny.
[02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000]  Since it was right there
[02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.000]  and everybody's already tweeting it
[02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000]  it's always a good time to make something.
[02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:36.000]  So the video of the bird chasing the dog
[02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000]  was already going around
[02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000]  and then Trump on the yard bird.
[02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000]  Right.
[02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:46.000]  It was already tweeted out by James Wood's.
[02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:50.000]  Well, the crew could play it right now.
[02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000]  I've already seen it a thousand times
[02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.000]  and I'd probably start laughing again.
[02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000]  But it was perfect timing too
[02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.000]  because you already had your meme
[02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000]  get pinned by the president
[02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000]  just last week.
[02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000]  Then you had CNN
[02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000]  get all flabbergasted
[02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000]  by the fact that the president watches your memes
[02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000]  and retweets them and pins them.
[02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000]  So then you use that segment
[02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000]  to create a meme
[02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000]  and then you put this meme out today
[02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000]  which has been seen
[02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000]  I don't know how many thousands of times
[02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000]  probably almost 100,000 times now.
[02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000]  Your Biden meme has been seen
[02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000]  probably close to 20 or 30, 40 million times.
[02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.000]  I think it's at 40 million now.
[02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.000]  And here's the amazing thing.
[02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000]  I don't know if you agree.
[02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000]  Tell me if you agree or disagree.
[02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000]  I think that what's driving them so crazy about this
[02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000]  because I could imagine
[02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000]  I've traveled to different countries.
[02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000]  I've had friends that speak different languages
[02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000]  and when you're sitting around in a group of friends
[02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000]  and they're speaking a different language
[02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000]  and everybody's kind of laughing
[02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000]  it's natural to have a little bit of frustration
[02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000]  like you wish you were in on the joke
[02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000]  you wish you were understood it
[02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000]  but they're not talking bad about you
[02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000]  so you just say okay I don't know the language it's fine
[02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.000]  but they genuinely don't understand
[02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000]  meme language.
[02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.000]  To them we keep speaking in it
[02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000]  we keep laughing we keep having a good time
[02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000]  and they keep getting more and more frustrated
[02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000]  and so because they can't
[02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000]  understand the language
[02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.000]  they just want it shut down.
[02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000]  Well alright so
[02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000]  this proves the exact
[02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000]  point you're making.
[02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.000]  So the Brian Stelter meme
[02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.000]  he didn't play
[02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000]  the Space Force
[02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000]  or the Space Force
[02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000]  video.
[02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000]  He played my video
[02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000]  and then I edited in there.
[02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000]  So he became part of the meme
[02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.000]  after he shared it.
[02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000]  That's how little he understands about meme
[02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000]  and meme culture is that he actually
[02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000]  shared my doctored video
[02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000]  where I added
[02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000]  the Spaceballs
[02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:50.000]  in there and his reactions
[02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000]  and he became part of the meme
[02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000]  and he spread it even further.
[02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000]  So everyone that watches his show
[02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000]  has now watched one of my memes
[02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000]  and you can see it
[02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000]  guys go back to that frame
[02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000]  you can see it in his face.
[02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000]  It's a guy
[02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000]  who's been studying this language
[02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000]  like he's studying a foreign language
[02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.000]  and he's genuinely trying to understand it
[02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000]  and he just can't get it
[02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000]  he just doesn't get it look at him
[02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000]  he's got an empty brain.
[02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.000]  Well and did you see
[02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000]  I triggered Chris Cuomo this week too?
[02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000]  Oh yeah and hey I give Cuomo credit
[02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000]  he actually kind of responds and he likes getting into it
[02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000]  he did respond to you but yeah he
[02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000]  he likes to get after it.
[02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000]  He thought he understood meme culture
[02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000]  and meme language but he didn't
[02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000]  did he?
[02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000]  No not even a little bit
[02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000]  bring it on bro it was hilarious.
[02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000]  Hold on though can we correct the record here
[02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000]  because
[02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000]  Brian Seltter said that you're from
[02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.000]  Kansas that's not true
[02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:50.000]  you've never been from Kansas you're from Iowa
[02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000]  and now you live in Kansas City, Missouri correct?
[02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000]  Correct.
[02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000]  I mean would you like
[02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000]  do you want to make a statement right now to Brian Seltter
[02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.000]  for the fake news he reported?
[02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000]  Brian that was
[02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:04.000]  despicable what you did
[02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000]  and I'm very disappointed.
[02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000]  No I'm serious what I want to do right now
[02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000]  is let's use this
[02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000]  and I want you to just do a little
[02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000]  60 second because let's take
[02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000]  this clip and you should put it on your Twitter
[02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000]  because Brian Seltter lied about where you're from
[02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000]  and I don't
[02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000]  appreciate that because I'm from Missouri
[02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000]  and I know that Missouri people have a lot of pride
[02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000]  and when you're on the most side
[02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.000]  of Kansas City you know you don't want to be
[02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:30.000]  on the Kansas side I mean I don't need to say anything
[02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000]  about what goes on over there but we know what's up
[02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000]  so just take 60
[02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.000]  seconds and then I think you should clip this
[02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.000]  out and put it on your Twitter and ask for
[02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000]  an apology maybe so
[02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000]  so look Brian you said that
[02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000]  Carpe Doctin was from Kansas
[02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000]  and that's not true it's never been
[02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000]  true so Carpe Doctin
[02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000]  would you like Brian Seltter to correct the record
[02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.000]  on his fake news
[02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.000]  Brian I'm officially
[02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000]  asking that you correct the record
[02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000]  I am from Iowa
[02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000]  and I am from Kansas City
[02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000]  because I moved here and I want
[02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000]  you to go on air and I would like
[02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000]  you to apologize for spreading
[02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000]  fake news about me
[02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000]  and I
[02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000]  would like you to play that meme one more time
[02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000]  just play it for real
[02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000]  this time and then maybe
[02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000]  if he makes that apology
[02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000]  you'll consider stop memeing him
[02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000]  maybe
[02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000]  maybe it's a possibility
[02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000]  it's not a strong possibility but it's a possibility
[02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000]  but that's the only chance that Brian Seltter has
[02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000]  Brian if you want to
[02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000]  Carpe Doctin to stop memeing you
[02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000]  you have to apologize for the fake news you said
[02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000]  about him
[02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000]  yes
[02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000]  that's where we're at
[02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.000]  now let's say that
[02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000]  let's say
[02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.000]  over there at CNN
[02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000]  they have a genuine interest
[02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000]  in understanding meme language
[02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000]  they clearly can't get it
[02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000]  are you considering starting a course
[02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000]  for the public memeology 101
[02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000]  you know
[02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000]  listen I'll talk to anybody
[02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000]  it doesn't matter
[02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000]  where they are on the spectrum of things
[02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000]  so if they want to learn how
[02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000]  to meme or more
[02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000]  specifically if they want to learn how
[02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000]  not to be the meme
[02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000]  then my door is always open
[02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000]  it can always come and talk to me
[02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000]  I would love nothing more than
[02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000]  to be on Brian Seltter's show
[02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000]  just so I could just destroy him on air
[02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000]  there you go
[02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000]  maybe Brian Seltter will bring you on air
[02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000]  but he'll be too busy looking for you in Kansas City
[02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000]  he doesn't
[02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000]  on the Kansas side on the wrong side
[02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000]  he needs to come to the Missouri side to find you
[02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000]  he doesn't know that
[02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000]  I thought it was kind of funny
[02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000]  what did he say
[02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000]  semi-anonymous
[02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000]  what does that mean
[02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000]  semi-anonymous
[02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000]  I think it means
[02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000]  if you want to remain anonymous
[02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000]  you should probably stop it
[02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000]  you're only semi-anonymous
[02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000]  we know who you are
[02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000]  but who is Brian Seltter really
[02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000]  is he related to Pennywise
[02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000]  well
[02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000]  what I know about
[02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000]  his lineage
[02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000]  is he came from a russet
[02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000]  and a Yukon gold
[02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000]  I believe is
[02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000]  they had a child
[02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000]  and then that child had a child
[02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000]  and it was him
[02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000]  I've never seen Brian Seltter and Pennywise
[02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000]  in the same place at the same time
[02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000]  I'm not sure what significance that has
[02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000]  but I'm just saying
[02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000]  I've never seen Brian Seltter and Pennywise
[02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000]  at the same place at the same time
[02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000]  Brian
[02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000]  I'm not sure if Brian has even understood
[02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000]  a word of this segment
[02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000]  in the same language
[02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000]  so Brian might not even have understood
[02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000]  hey we need to get closed captioning
[02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000]  for CNN guys
[02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000]  can we get closed captioning for Brian Seltter
[02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000]  he didn't understand a word of this segment
[02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000]  Brian
[02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000]  oh Brian
[02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000]  oh little Brian
[02:15:56.000 --> 02:16:20.000]  Brian

[02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000]  Brian
[02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000]  Hi I'm Dan Pilla
[02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago
[02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000]  when they tried to seize my mother's house
[02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000]  I sued the IRS in one
[02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000]  I beat the IRS then
[02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000]  and I've been beating them ever since
[02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement
[02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000]  and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems
[02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000]  they thought might never be solved
[02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000]  I can help you too
[02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000]  if you owe taxes you can't pay
[02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000]  don't wait another day

[02:19:53.000 --> 02:20:03.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:43.000]  So, I have just been sent a video. I don't even know what to say or think, but it's all coming together now.
[02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:55.000]  Apparently, apparently, white nationalists are now stealing the clown symbol or ideology, I guess, and claiming it as racist.
[02:20:55.000 --> 02:21:07.000]  Folks, the dementia, the Trump derangement syndrome, the total lunacy that the left has spiraled into now, it's honestly undescribable.
[02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:14.000]  So, the crew is censoring this video. I don't know if Carpe Doctin is aware of this. I think his next meme is approaching, though.
[02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:28.000]  Carpe, are you aware of this from Kansas City, Missouri, not Kansas? Are you aware that the left is now claiming that somehow Trump supporters are stealing, I guess, the symbolism of clowns to make it racist?
[02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000]  Are you aware of this?
[02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:50.000]  Yeah, I heard about it a little bit ago. I think maybe a day or two ago. I haven't looked into it very much, but I know that they're doing the same thing they did with Pepe, the frog, and they're trying to make that this clown thing into a racist thing.
[02:21:50.000 --> 02:22:02.000]  I'm sure that it has origins on 4chan, because that's where usually most of this stuff comes from, and they troll journalists and TV personalities, too.
[02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:11.000]  They think things like the OK symbol is a white power symbol, or milk is racist, or all of those things that they've done already. I'm sure it's just one of those.
[02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:22.000]  See, and this is why they need to learn how to not be a meme. Guys, flash that video that I sent you that we're going to cover once we clean it up. This is a perfect example of how you're doing it wrong.
[02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:31.000]  This is asking to become a meme. This is begging to become a meme. In fact, it's so bad. I'm wondering if this isn't a conservative pretending to be a liberal to get memed.
[02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:42.000]  But I think it was actually the Pepe that they put in a rainbow wig that has apparently triggered this, which by the way, that's been around for years, but now they're just responding to it.
[02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:49.000]  Well, I forget what they call him. It has a name. Oh, it's Jared Holtz reporting on it.
[02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:56.000]  Well, he's a crack journalist. Do you know he celebrated his whole weekend because he finally got verified on Twitter? Literally made his weekend.
[02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.000]  I talked to him in DMs about it.
[02:22:58.000 --> 02:22:59.000]  He got a new cat.
[02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:02.000]  He's pretty excited. He got a new cat, too.
[02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:07.000]  Yeah, he got a new cat over it. I think he's got two or three cats now.
[02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:10.000]  So he's a crazy cat lately now.
[02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:18.000]  Well, no, I mean, you know, you gotta, I mean, everybody, you gotta, you gotta get a pussy somehow. So he's got a couple cats.
[02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:24.000]  What? What? What? He's the only way he can get a cat is by getting it.
[02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:28.000]  What? What is what? Did I make a joke? I'm sorry.
[02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:41.000]  So, so, Jared Holtz, dude, I look, I actually like Jared. I try to be friends with the guy, but you know, that's celebrating your Twitter verification by buying another cat.
[02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:43.000]  That's how you mean yourself.
[02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:51.000]  That's how you become a meme. Yeah, I don't like his politics at all, but I've been, you know, kind of cordial with him over the years.
[02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:57.000]  But yeah, that's that's not that's not the way to get taken seriously.
[02:23:57.000 --> 02:24:03.000]  It's okay. It's okay to have cats. It's fine. No, no, everybody needs pussy in their life. It's fine.
[02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:13.000]  So, so, so Jared has five cats and it's fine. I'm not, I don't have, I don't have any cats, but but you know, everything's fine in Jared Holtz world.
[02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:18.000]  He's finally verified and he's got a cat. I'd name it Jared.
[02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:23.000]  How dare you do that to cats?
[02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:28.000]  But look, Jared's got the big story. I give him credit. He was actually ahead of his time on this one.
[02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:34.000]  White nationalists adopt clown as their next race is simple. I had no idea we were doing this.
[02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:38.000]  I mean, we've been doing this for years, but apparently it's new news.
[02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:44.000]  I was a NBC called me extremely far right.
[02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:50.000]  So I guess, I guess I didn't get that memo or like I'm not subscribed to the right newsletter.
[02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:53.000]  Not sure. I have no idea what that's what we were doing.
[02:24:53.000 --> 02:25:01.000]  No, but look at this. This is, this is the pop up notification when you land on right wing watch.com.
[02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:08.000]  This is the pop up notification. Stand against hate from white supremacist to the radical religious right.
[02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:16.000]  Right wing extremism is on the rise. Pledge to stand against hate. Sign up now at right wing watch.com.
[02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:20.000]  Just, just take my money, Jared. That was such a good statement.
[02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:26.000]  Meanwhile, I don't know what the deal is with these people. They are the ones that hate us.
[02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:31.000]  Like, I don't hate you, man. I came up every time I see Jared, I come up and I say, Hey, bud, how you doing?
[02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:37.000]  Like, we're the least hateful people, man. I'm having fun. Okay. I'm having fun right now memeing you.
[02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:47.000]  Brian Stelter DM'd me before, before the reliable sources thing and was asking me questions.
[02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:56.000]  I, I really thought about just sending him all of the videos I've done of him, like just in DMS, but I answered his questions.
[02:25:56.000 --> 02:26:06.000]  As much as I make fun of him, I'm still a nice guy. I'm not going to be mean to him.
[02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:11.000]  So can you stick around for another segment after this? Yeah, that's fine.
[02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:15.000]  All right, we're going to, we're going to have, we're going to do some new memeing. I've got an idea.
[02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:20.000]  We're going to meme, we're going to meme hardcore on the other side of this segment, but I'm good with that.
[02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:26.000]  You know, I just think it's hilarious that they don't understand that they're just digging themselves a bigger hole.
[02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:34.000]  Like, you can't un-meme a meme. When you try to un-meme a meme, you just give the meme more power.
[02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:40.000]  Right. You definitely can't respond to it in the way you would normally respond to it.
[02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:50.000]  Like Joe Biden and his response to the, to my video that Trump tweeted, it was not a solid response.
[02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:59.000]  And Brian Stelter retweeting and, and Chris Cuomo retweeting, not, not the right move.
[02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:08.000]  Hey, what do you think about this big news? Did you hear that Gillette Venus has just announced Amy Schumer as their new, as their new model?
[02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:15.000]  Have you seen this? So they don't want to sell women's razors either? Is that, is that what's going on?
[02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:20.000]  Well, I'm not exactly sure the marketing campaign, but they've decided to go with Amy Schumer.
[02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:25.000]  There she is there. There she is there posing as a beached whale.
[02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:31.000]  So I think that Gillette, I just wanted to give them some credit here because, you know, it used to be the best a man can get.
[02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:39.000]  Now it's men are the worst in the world. And then, but, but it's probably a good marketing move, I think, here for Gillette to go with Amy Schumer.
[02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:40.000]  Your thoughts?
[02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:44.000]  Well, I mean, if you're going to, if you're going to go social justice warrior, then you have to go all in.
[02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:48.000]  I mean, you can't go halfway. You can't just be sort of a social justice warrior.
[02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:51.000]  You have to like go scorched earth with it. So this makes sense.
[02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:58.000]  Man, you know, I'm at a point right now where I'm trying to decide, do I ratchet it back?
[02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:05.000]  Or do I go forward? Like, do, do, do I, do I not be so mean or do I push the ball forward and be even more mean?
[02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:07.000]  I think we know the answer to that.
[02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:16.000]  All right. Well, look, I'm, I'm just getting word into my ear. This is not actually Amy Schumer.
[02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:18.000]  Oh, my God, it isn't.
[02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:19.000]  No. Are you kidding me?
[02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:24.000]  No, but it, well, Amy Schumer was supposed to be the model for Gillette Venus.
[02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:26.000]  And then this woman showed up and ate her.
[02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:30.000]  Oh, my God. This is a, this is a national tragedy.
[02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:35.000]  All right. Get the typewriters ready.
[02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:43.000]  Owen Troyer, body shames, new Gillette Venus model on the beach. It's fine. I get it. Whatever.
[02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:45.000]  Chuck Schumer is going to come after you.
[02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:49.000]  No, Chuck. No, actually Chuck Schumer is going to dive into that and try to find Amy again.
[02:28:49.000 --> 02:29:18.000]  All right. We've got new memes coming on the other side. Don't go anywhere, folks. It's The Alex Jones Show.
[02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:24.000]  I was 17 when I became addicted to heroin and meth. I thought I could quit on my own, but I couldn't.
[02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:27.000]  It hit me when I was arrested.

[02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:11.000]  even take your dog for a walk. Believe me, I know I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:16.000]  But thanks to SupermailVitality at InfowarsStore.com, I still have that energy.
[02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:22.000]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water,
[02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:29.000]  to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours to still have the stamina and endurance,
[02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:36.000]  energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park and get exercise that you need for your health.

[02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:15.000]  That's why InfowarsLife created the powerful vitamin mineral fusion formula.

[02:31:56.000 --> 02:32:03.000]  There are thousands of ideologies out there, hundreds of different political systems and most of them are funded by the globalist.
[02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:07.000]  Infowars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:10.000]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:18.000]  I didn't invent all this, I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana and what really works for humanity and I'm simply trying to bring it back.
[02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:22.000]  And lo and behold, it's super popular like it's always been.
[02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:30.000]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately because we have the light in the dark of the night that sends chills up my spine.
[02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:36.000]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and Infowars by buying the great products at InfowarsStore.com,

[02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:28.000]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:33.000]  And my guest is Carpe Dongtum, meme legend.
[02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:43.000]  We're still investigating whether or not he was featured in a South Park episode.
[02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:49.000]  The jury is still out on that, but we'll monitor that investigation.
[02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:58.000]  As it's ongoing, I've also got a viral clown video coming up in the next segment you're not going to want to believe, but there is that Carpe Dongtum.
[02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:08.000]  We cannot confirm her tonight, folks, but it's rumored that that character featured on South Park might be Carpe Dongtum.
[02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:14.000]  Well, I got to say, what we're about to do here is quite groundbreaking.
[02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:22.000]  And we are actually going to have the Brian Stelter interview of Carpe Dongtum here on the Alex Jones show.
[02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:26.000]  So that's the kind of groundbreaking stuff that we bring to you here at Infowars.
[02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:28.000]  So let's go ahead and I'm going to pitch it.
[02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:32.000]  Go ahead, bring Brian Stelter on in, folks.
[02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:35.000]  Thank you so much, Owen.
[02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:37.000]  Oh, thanks for having me, Brian.
[02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:39.000]  Well, that's fine.
[02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:42.000]  I'm glad that we're able to do this interview here on Infowars.
[02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:50.000]  My bosses at CNN said this type of content was too racist for our airwaves, but obviously Infowars totally supports this.
[02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:59.000]  And I am a little nervous right now because your meme power scares me, but I just have to come out and say it.
[02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:06.000]  I believe you're a racist and I believe that, yes, yes, I know the truth hurts.
[02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:19.000]  And I believe that your racist memes, your racist memes, no, you sir, you sir, you sir, yes, your racist memes are causing irreputable damage to this country.
[02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:23.000]  And it's just disrespectful to minorities.
[02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:30.000]  And so what do you say for yourself after committing these crimes against humanity?
[02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:33.000]  I'm just really sorry.
[02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:35.000]  I didn't mean to do it.
[02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:41.000]  I try to be a good person and I just can't do it sometimes and I'm really sorry.
[02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:50.000]  Well, you know, I'm glad that you would take this stance in front of your young child there because we don't want a future for our kids.
[02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:55.000]  Our kids to grow up with this meme culture that you've created.
[02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:57.000]  And let me ask you this.
[02:35:57.000 --> 02:36:04.000]  Have you heard from PETA from your latest meme for the abuse of animals now that you're engaged in?
[02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:09.000]  I haven't yet, but I see where you're going with it and you know what?
[02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:18.000]  I realize now that doing what I did to that poor bird.
[02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:20.000]  I mean, it was not okay.
[02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:24.000]  Do you think that bird wants something to do with Trump?
[02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:25.000]  I don't think so.
[02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:34.000]  I mean, I didn't ask and that was part of the problem is I didn't get consent from the bird before I put the head on it and I'm really sorry.
[02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:37.000]  Now, think about that dog that you've tortured now too.
[02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:38.000]  Now that dog.
[02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:39.000]  The dog.
[02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:40.000]  No, the dog's fine.
[02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:41.000]  The dog is now CNN.
[02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:43.000]  So that means he's obviously good.
[02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:48.000]  Well, you've been torturing us too, Carpe, don't you understand?
[02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:50.000]  We feel tortured by you.
[02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:58.000]  And I just feel that this dog now is going to have to live with this anguish and this pain that you've caused him.
[02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:04.000]  And quite frankly, I think PETA should file a complaint against you.
[02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:06.000]  What do you think?
[02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:07.000]  Did your child?
[02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:11.000]  Did your child just give me the finger?
[02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:13.000]  Oh my gosh.
[02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:18.000]  So now not only are you so now not only are you abusing yard birds?
[02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:22.000]  You're now making your child flip the bird.
[02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:23.000]  That is correct.
[02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:25.000]  I think that's where we're at, Brian.
[02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:26.000]  Well, this is unbelievable, folks.
[02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:27.000]  I've got breaking news.
[02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:29.000]  Brian Salty here from CNN.
[02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:32.000]  Not only does Carpe don't abuse animals.
[02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:34.000]  We will immediately get this to PETA.
[02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:41.000]  But now I need child protective services to come and figure this out because I'm pretty sure that live on camera.
[02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:45.000]  Carpe don't just made his kid flip me the bird.
[02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:51.000]  This is abhorrent behavior that we're witnessing right here live on air, folks.
[02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:54.000]  What do you think about this guy?
[02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:56.000]  What do you think about him?
[02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:58.000]  Did he just wave me off?
[02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:00.000]  Did he just wave me off?
[02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:03.000]  I don't think he likes you.
[02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:04.000]  Well, I'm not surprised.
[02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:08.000]  Being is how he's probably from Kansas like you.
[02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:12.000]  Well, I mean, he's better looking than you, too, though.
[02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:18.000]  I have heard that I have the type of face that only a mother could love.
[02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:20.000]  Only a potato could love.
[02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:21.000]  That's what I think.
[02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:29.000]  Well, I did get my DNA test and the potato is actually one of my closest relatives.
[02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:32.000]  It was Russet, right?
[02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:36.000]  Well, actually, my uncle is featured in Toy Story.
[02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:38.000]  Mr. Potato Head?
[02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:40.000]  Oh, yeah.
[02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:41.000]  He plays with one of those.
[02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:46.000]  You see, this is the type of meme we're talking about.
[02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:49.000]  This is the type of meme we're talking about right here.
[02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:52.000]  And now you're abusing potatoes.
[02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:56.000]  Is there any limit to your bigotry?
[02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:59.000]  There is literally no limit to my bigotry.
[02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:02.000]  It goes so deep.
[02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:05.000]  It has no bottom.
[02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:07.000]  You can't reach the bottom.
[02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:09.000]  It goes on forever.
[02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:11.000]  Wow.
[02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:13.000]  Well, there you have it, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:16.000]  Brian Stelter here from Reliable Sources with CNN.
[02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:17.000]  We break the truth.
[02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:20.000]  We've discovered now the truth about Carpe Donkton.
[02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:22.000]  He abuses animals.
[02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:26.000]  He makes his kids flip CNN hosts, the bird.
[02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:29.000]  And he has no respect for even food.
[02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:31.000]  And he memes potatoes.
[02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:36.000]  So you'll only get this type of quality content on Reliable Sources with CNN.
[02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:40.000]  I think we now know the truth about the real Carpe Donkton.
[02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:46.000]  And if I can, I will dox him to the public so that you can go harass him and his child.
[02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:49.000]  Because that's what we do at CNN.
[02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:53.000]  You got more viewers than on Infowars than you did on CNN.
[02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:54.000]  Wow.
[02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:55.000]  How about that for Brian Stelter?
[02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:57.000]  Hey, give Brian Stelter a round of applause.
[02:39:57.000 --> 02:40:00.000]  That's the biggest interview Brian Stelter has done in his career.
[02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:01.000]  Pretty sure.
[02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:02.000]  Yeah.
[02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:05.000]  I think that was, that was the biggest interview.
[02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:08.000]  That was like, that was the mountaintop, I think.
[02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:09.000]  I think so.
[02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:14.000]  And I got to say, your young child is already outsmarting Brian Stelter.
[02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:16.000]  I mean, it doesn't take much.
[02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:19.000]  But hey, you got to give him credit where credit's due.
[02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:21.000]  That's true.
[02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:25.000]  You know, I was going to say that this was actually Brian.
[02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:29.000]  It was too mean.
[02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:31.000]  I couldn't do it to him.
[02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:32.000]  Yeah.
[02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:34.000]  You don't want to put that on your young child like that.
[02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:36.000]  Leave it to the potato head.
[02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:37.000]  Like that.
[02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:38.000]  Right there.
[02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:40.000]  Mr. Stelter potato head.
[02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:43.000]  But look at that cutie that you got right there on your lap.
[02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:44.000]  Boy, that's fun.
[02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:45.000]  All right.
[02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:46.000]  Yeah.
[02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:47.000]  You want to go play dad?
[02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:50.000]  You know who this is?
[02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:51.000]  This is Jones.
[02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:52.000]  No.
[02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:57.000]  It's not, it's not actually related to Alex Jones, but that's what his name is.
[02:40:57.000 --> 02:40:58.000]  That's Jones right there?
[02:40:58.000 --> 02:40:59.000]  Jones.
[02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:02.000]  He's pretty relaxed for a Jones.
[02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:03.000]  Yeah.
[02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:09.000]  He has not been taking the super beta male or super, super whatever.
[02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:11.000]  He's not taking the super male vitality yet?
[02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:12.000]  Yeah.
[02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:13.000]  Super male vitality.
[02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:17.000]  It looks like he's, see, look, he's saying, daddy, give me the super male.
[02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:19.000]  I need my brain force.
[02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:24.000]  So little Jones joins us on Carpe Donkton's lap.
[02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:27.000]  Well, hey, we're going to let you go play dad.
[02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:29.000]  We've had a lot of fun with you.
[02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:35.000]  And I just, I'm looking forward to the next meme, whatever it is that you're working on,
[02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:38.000]  and we'll be sure to promote it.
[02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:45.000]  You can follow me on Twitter and you can follow me and all my friends on the Donald on Reddit.
[02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:48.000]  And thank you for having me on again.
[02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:49.000]  We need to stop doing this.
[02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:51.000]  Otherwise people are going to start talking.
[02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:55.000]  You mean quit having our meetings out in broad daylight?
[02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:56.000]  Right.
[02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:57.000]  Keep it behind the scenes.
[02:41:57.000 --> 02:42:01.000]  We need to go to that secret club that we're all a part of that we don't know about.
[02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:02.000]  Yeah.
[02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:03.000]  Yeah.
[02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:04.000]  But it's run by the clowns.
[02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:05.000]  That's right.
[02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:06.000]  Uh-oh.
[02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:07.000]  Here we go.
[02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:08.000]  Uh-oh.
[02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:09.000]  He doesn't like the clowns.
[02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:10.000]  He's mad about that.
[02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:11.000]  Yeah.
[02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:12.000]  He doesn't.
[02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:13.000]  All right.
[02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:14.000]  It's Carpe Doctor folks.
[02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:15.000]  It's meme legend.
[02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:17.000]  And it just follow him on Twitter for the greatest memes and they get retweeted by the president
[02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:19.000]  now and it just has the left going nuts.
[02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:22.000]  Now there has been a drought in some areas.
[02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:27.000]  We can thank Carpe Doctor from providing for providing liberal tears to stop those droughts.
[02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:28.000]  All right.
[02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:31.000]  There goes Carpe Doctor at Carpe Doctor on Twitter.
[02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:32.000]  He is meme legend.
[02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:36.000]  I'm Owen Shroyer filling in for Alex Jones coming back.
[02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:37.000]  Do a quick news blitz.
[02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:41.000]  Play this shocking clown video.
[02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:44.000]  The left keeps going deeper into insanity folks.
[02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:47.000]  Honestly, I don't even know how to analyze this next one.
[02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:49.000]  You can do it with me on the other side.
[02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:55.000]  During this four minute break, go to infowarstore.com and take advantage of our big specials.
[02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:57.000]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[02:42:57.000 --> 02:42:58.000]  Go ahead.
[02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:00.000]  I just have to say something, man.
[02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:04.000]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:05.000]  It just gets old now.
[02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:07.000]  I'm going to shut you down right now.
[02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:08.000]  Okay.
[02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:10.000]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:14.000]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:17.000]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:20.000]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:21.000]  I mean, what's it going to take?
[02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:22.000]  Us being shut down?
[02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:24.000]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:25.000]  You know what, Alex?
[02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:26.000]  Put him on pause again.
[02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:27.000]  Hey, Frank!
[02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:31.000]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear.
[02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:32.000]  We're under attack.
[02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:33.000]  We need your help.
[02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:37.000]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:40.000]  I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:41.000]  You understand?
[02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:42.000]  I need your help, Frank.
[02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:44.000]  I need your help, Frank.
[02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:50.000]  Go to infowarstore.com right now and help fund the info war.
[02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:51.000]  Do you understand?
[02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:53.000]  I need your help, Frank.
[02:43:53.000 --> 02:44:21.000]  We need your help, Frank.
[02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:23.000]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:26.000]  They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:31.000]  And that's why the globalist, Hillary, and others are trying to shut in for us now.
[02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:38.000]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech, about taking your very sovereignty away.
[02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:40.000]  This country is in a war.
[02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:44.000]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you, if you don't
[02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:47.000]  spread the articles and videos, and if you don't financially get the great products we
[02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:50.000]  have and fund us, and the 360 win, we're dead in the water.
[02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:51.000]  I'm in your hands.
[02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:52.000]  You're in my hands.

[02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:16.000]  Watch me! Watch me!
[02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:19.000]  I've never been to Russia and I'm not a Russophile.
[02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:25.000]  But I do know that most of the claims mainstream media makes against Vladimir Putin in Russia
[02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:29.000]  are not to be almost entirely untrue or flat out lies.
[02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:34.000]  Like the fact that he kills members of the media all the time or shuts down the free press.
[02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:36.000]  None of it's true.
[02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:41.000]  He has taken over some of the state run media and put people in that are actually pro Russia,
[02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:44.000]  pro sovereignty, pro Christian, pro free market.
[02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:47.000]  No evidence he's had any members of the media killed.
[02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:50.000]  But separate from that, let's just say he's got problems.
[02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:52.000]  Okay, fine.
[02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:57.000]  Paul Watson has a big article up on InfoWars.com pointing out today that Putin came out in a big interview and said
[02:47:57.000 --> 02:48:03.000]  independent free political debate is essential and that citizens shouldn't be censored
[02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:06.000]  for their criticism of government or their support or anything else.
[02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:12.000]  He said what really mattered was stopping criminals and cyber hacking and things like that.
[02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:17.000]  It's critical of the massive censorship we see popping up at the European Union and now the United States.
[02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:24.000]  So Putin understands that we're dealing with authoritarianism here in the West that covers its actions
[02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:27.000]  under the name of hate speech and political correctness.
[02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:33.000]  But really it's just good old fashioned totalitarianism and censorship and it's getting worse.
[02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:40.000]  Again, Christina Amanpour saying arrest people that say Hillary is a crook to the former FBI director.
[02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:42.000]  This is the nature of what we deal with.
[02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:45.000]  So where is it going to go from this point?
[02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:50.000]  Well, only down because President Trump's done a great job of many other frauds.
[02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:57.000]  But so far, other than saying he would go after colleges with an executive order that don't allow free speech on campus,
[02:48:57.000 --> 02:49:02.000]  he's done almost nothing other than tweet about it about the organized, racketeering,
[02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:11.000]  massive coordinated censorship to manipulate and steal the last election 2018 and to clearly try to steal 2020.
[02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:17.000]  For Brian Skelter and the rest of them, they're on television calling for more censorship and basically policing.
[02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:21.000]  The corporate media polices for big tech and it's dangerous.
[02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:28.000]  It's un-American and it's up to us, we the people, to take action politically, economically, to stop it and to
[02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:32.000]  light a fire in the president's butt to do that as well.
[02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:39.000]  You know, Trump's former DHS had kept soft-soaping what was happening at the border and backpedaling and playing games
[02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:44.000]  and talking up both sides of her mouth and she's gone now and a hardliner is about to be put in.
[02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:48.000]  And a lot of that's because we've been keeping a fire lit under Trump's butt.
[02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:52.000]  He's busy, he's getting pulled from a lot of different sides and he means well.
[02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:58.000]  But in all this cacophony of voices, we need to be the loudest defending this republic.
[02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:04.000]  So let's continue to lobby the president to defend the First Amendment and to stop big tech racketeering
[02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:06.000]  to make sure they follow Section 230.
[02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:13.000]  But again, Vladimir Putin, free speech is critical for an open free society and the internet shouldn't be censored.
[02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:15.000]  Only criminal activity should be stopped.
[02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:17.000]  Sounds like Putin is trying to follow Section 230.
[02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:19.000]  Maybe we should as well.
[02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:22.000]  That's Alex Jones here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:26.000]  Welcome back to the Infowars World Headquarters in Austin, Texas.
[02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:30.000]  I want to thank everybody for supporting us at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:38.000]  A lot of you sent me the products you purchased on Twitter and I just can't say how much it means for you to support us.
[02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:42.000]  And I know that a lot of you share the links, share the videos.
[02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:44.000]  That means a lot as well.
[02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:48.000]  I know that you risk scrutiny and censorship when you do that, but this is the Infowar
[02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:54.000]  and we salute you for shopping at InfowarsStore.com and sharing the links at Infowars.com.
[02:50:54.000 --> 02:51:03.000]  Now, I'm really not even sure how to properly characterize this other than Trump derangement syndrome and beyond
[02:51:03.000 --> 02:51:08.000]  because the left has gone into a complete fit of lunacy.
[02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:18.000]  And so the story comes from my favorite left-wing commentator, Jared Holt, right?
[02:51:18.000 --> 02:51:21.000]  White nationalists adopt clown as their next racist symbol.
[02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:24.000]  These people actually think they're in our head.
[02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:27.000]  There's been so many different forms of Pepe put out there.
[02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:33.000]  There's like Trump Pepe's, like Arnold Schwarzenegger Pepe's, thinking man Pepe's.
[02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:38.000]  It's just like you just make all these Pepe's, it just became this kind of like infinite meme.
[02:51:38.000 --> 02:51:44.000]  And so one of them has been Pepe in like a clown mask or Pepe in a rainbow wig.
[02:51:44.000 --> 02:51:47.000]  It's been going on for years, but somehow this is now our new thing.
[02:51:47.000 --> 02:51:49.000]  But here's what happens.
[02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:54.000]  The left thinks they have conservatives figured out and they're so far off base.
[02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:58.000]  I mean, they need a map and a key and it's just like they still can't figure out where the hell we are.
[02:51:58.000 --> 02:52:01.000]  They can't even understand the language that we're speaking.
[02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:04.000]  But they still need to provide commentary on it and act intellectual.
[02:52:04.000 --> 02:52:08.000]  So what they do is they pretend like they know what they're thinking
[02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:15.000]  and then they project what they think we're doing with a clown Pepe when it's totally off base.
[02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:20.000]  But then we roll with it out of just because it's a joke how out of touch with reality they are.
[02:52:20.000 --> 02:52:27.000]  And so then it becomes this weird like fake self-fulfilling prophecy that they then think is real
[02:52:27.000 --> 02:52:37.000]  but because they don't understand meme language, they don't understand that they're a continual infinite loop of perpetual memes.
[02:52:37.000 --> 02:52:42.000]  And so yeah, you think we're taking some clown symbol as like our next symbol
[02:52:42.000 --> 02:52:44.000]  even though that's like way out of left field totally inaccurate.
[02:52:44.000 --> 02:52:45.000]  Now we will.
[02:52:45.000 --> 02:52:49.000]  But you're only giving us more ammo to meme on.
[02:52:49.000 --> 02:52:51.000]  Here is a video.
[02:52:51.000 --> 02:52:56.000]  Folks, television audience, you'll see this radio audience.
[02:52:56.000 --> 02:52:57.000]  It's a woman.
[02:52:57.000 --> 02:52:59.000]  She's got weird hair.
[02:52:59.000 --> 02:53:00.000]  I don't even know how to explain it.
[02:53:00.000 --> 02:53:02.000]  Weird clown makeup on.
[02:53:02.000 --> 02:53:11.000]  And now she's going to war for the clown Pepe meme.
[02:53:11.000 --> 02:53:16.000]  I'm pissed off and I'm angry and I'm disgusted and I made a video ranting about it.
[02:53:16.000 --> 02:53:19.000]  But I don't even think I want to post it because I don't want to give them that much attention.
[02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:21.000]  We'll see where it goes.
[02:53:21.000 --> 02:53:26.000]  I'll keep the video on ice and we'll just see how far they want to take this.
[02:53:26.000 --> 02:53:27.000]  Put the video on ice.
[02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:28.000]  Pause it right there.
[02:53:28.000 --> 02:53:29.000]  I'm ready.
[02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:33.000]  Look lady, do you know how insane you are?
[02:53:33.000 --> 02:53:38.000]  First you paint your face up like Pennywise the Clown to do a rant.
[02:53:38.000 --> 02:53:44.000]  Then you do the rant on video and you don't even publish it so it's quote unquote on ice.
[02:53:44.000 --> 02:53:51.000]  And then you do a follow up rant in a clown outfit, in a clown makeup outfit that you put on for this rant about clowns
[02:53:51.000 --> 02:53:58.000]  that is literally concocted in your own mind that conservatives are using clown memes for some agenda.
[02:53:58.000 --> 02:53:59.000]  It's all in your mind.
[02:53:59.000 --> 02:54:03.000]  And now because of that, you've now painted your face like a clown.
[02:54:03.000 --> 02:54:05.000]  You've done a video rant that you have on ice.
[02:54:05.000 --> 02:54:09.000]  And then you do a follow up video that you think is going to somehow be a victory.
[02:54:09.000 --> 02:54:10.000]  Go ahead.
[02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:11.000]  But I'm ready to go to war.
[02:54:11.000 --> 02:54:15.000]  I'm ready to go to mother f***ing clore.
[02:54:15.000 --> 02:54:16.000]  Wait, clore?
[02:54:16.000 --> 02:54:18.000]  You're not going to take a symbol of happiness.
[02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:19.000]  Hold on.
[02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:20.000]  Can you rewind that?
[02:54:20.000 --> 02:54:21.000]  Just hold on.
[02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:22.000]  Pause that.
[02:54:22.000 --> 02:54:23.000]  Rewind that back 10 seconds.
[02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:24.000]  Did you say she wants to go to the core?
[02:54:24.000 --> 02:54:25.000]  What is core?
[02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:26.000]  Hold on.
[02:54:26.000 --> 02:54:27.000]  Hold on.
[02:54:27.000 --> 02:54:28.000]  Go ahead.
[02:54:28.000 --> 02:54:31.000]  I'll keep the video on ice and we'll just see how far they want to take this.
[02:54:31.000 --> 02:54:32.000]  But I'm ready to go to war.
[02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:35.000]  I'm ready to go to mother f***ing clore.
[02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:36.000]  Core.
[02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:42.000]  You're not going to take a symbol of happiness and acceptance and multiculturalism and turn
[02:54:42.000 --> 02:54:46.000]  it into something racist and anti-Semitic and homophobic and transphobic.
[02:54:46.000 --> 02:54:48.000]  You're not going to do that on my watch.
[02:54:48.000 --> 02:54:50.000]  You're not.
[02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:53.000]  So Pepe, he belongs to me now.
[02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:54.000]  Oh.
[02:54:54.000 --> 02:54:55.000]  Pepe, the frog.
[02:54:55.000 --> 02:54:56.000]  The cartoon belongs to you.
[02:54:56.000 --> 02:54:59.000]  When his curly-ass Afro clown wig belongs to me.
[02:54:59.000 --> 02:55:02.000]  That is a symbol of the resistance now.
[02:55:02.000 --> 02:55:09.000]  I encourage you all to share, I'm going to photoshop a picture of Pepe with just tons of
[02:55:09.000 --> 02:55:16.000]  pro-LGBTQ symbols and pro-black symbols and we are taking Pepe back.
[02:55:16.000 --> 02:55:17.000]  He is mine.
[02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:19.000]  I'm adopting him.
[02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:25.000]  I'm saving him from these freaks, these degenerates who think that it's okay to take a symbol
[02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:31.000]  of happiness and just, it's disgusting.
[02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:37.000]  It's literally, it's sickening, it's sickening that people would take such a positive thing
[02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:42.000]  like clowns and try to make it into a symbol for your racism.
[02:55:42.000 --> 02:55:44.000]  You're pathetic.
[02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:48.000]  The clown emoji belongs to us, the Lunchables.
[02:55:48.000 --> 02:55:53.000]  Pepe the frog, the clown version and just him in general honestly because he's been through
[02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:54.000]  a lot.
[02:55:54.000 --> 02:55:57.000]  He belongs to us, the Lunchables.
[02:55:57.000 --> 02:56:00.000]  You thought, you really thought.
[02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:05.000]  You left beer, cheeto, dust, butt sniffing, fur sniffing.
[02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:08.000]  Stop it, stop it.
[02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:11.000]  Oh my God.
[02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:14.000]  Please, please rewind this.
[02:56:14.000 --> 02:56:16.000]  Please rewind this.
[02:56:16.000 --> 02:56:17.000]  Rewind this 15 seconds.
[02:56:17.000 --> 02:56:19.000]  I'm sorry, I'm trying to hold back my laughter.
[02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:21.000]  This is too, this can't be real.
[02:56:21.000 --> 02:56:23.000]  This has to be a conservative troll, right?
[02:56:23.000 --> 02:56:26.000]  I mean this cannot be real.
[02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:29.000]  Please roll it one more time.
[02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:31.000]  You thought, you really thought.
[02:56:31.000 --> 02:56:38.000]  You left beer, cheeto, dust, butt sniffing, fur sniffing, living with your mother, father,
[02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:39.000]  grandma.
[02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:42.000]  I don't care, you f**king a*****.
[02:56:42.000 --> 02:56:45.000]  I have adopted Pepe and he's mine.
[02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:47.000]  They want to, oh we're going to put the symbol out there.
[02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:48.000]  You put it out there and guess what?
[02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:52.000]  I grabbed his a** and now he's mine.
[02:56:52.000 --> 02:56:55.000]  You cannot take this from me.
[02:56:55.000 --> 02:56:57.000]  I will not let you.
[02:56:57.000 --> 02:57:01.000]  Clowns are a symbol of happiness and acceptance.
[02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:04.000]  And like I said, multiculturalism, we embrace everybody.
[02:57:04.000 --> 02:57:06.000]  We embrace you rather you're black.
[02:57:06.000 --> 02:57:09.000]  Okay, so there you go.
[02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:15.000]  News update, Pepe's a fictional character, okay?
[02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:19.000]  So I don't know how you plan on grabbing and adopting Pepe.
[02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:21.000]  And it was Pennywise the clown.
[02:57:21.000 --> 02:57:25.000]  If anybody's demonized the happy symbol of clown, it was Stephen King and Pennywise
[02:57:25.000 --> 02:57:27.000]  and all the movies with it.
[02:57:27.000 --> 02:57:31.000]  And then she's like, clowns are supposed to be a symbol of happiness and fun.
[02:57:31.000 --> 02:57:33.000]  You're the one that's so angry in the video.
[02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:34.000]  We're having fun with it.
[02:57:34.000 --> 02:57:36.000]  You're the one that's angry.
[02:57:36.000 --> 02:57:37.000]  But where does it go from here?
[02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:39.000]  Because she's ready to go to whore over this.
[02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:45.000]  She's ready to go to whore over Pepe the clown meme.
[02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:47.000]  If you're not expanding, you're imploding.
[02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:49.000]  There is no set stasis.
[02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:50.000]  There is no managed system.
[02:57:50.000 --> 02:57:52.000]  There is no uncontenual.
[02:57:52.000 --> 02:57:55.000]  The continuum is always launching forward in the future.
[02:57:55.000 --> 02:57:58.000]  So you support us and get creative and get fired up.
[02:57:58.000 --> 02:58:00.000]  We won't just be here 100 years.
[02:58:00.000 --> 02:58:01.000]  We'll be here forever.
[02:58:01.000 --> 02:58:02.000]  We'll turn the whole thing around.
[02:58:02.000 --> 02:58:07.000]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases and God knows what are going to look back and say,
[02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:09.000]  you know, we struggled here, we made it.
[02:58:09.000 --> 02:58:11.000]  And that's really where this goes.
[02:58:11.000 --> 02:58:13.000]  God's got a big war for you ready.
[02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:18.000]  And so if you can't face George Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mao Zedong,
[02:58:18.000 --> 02:58:20.000]  are you going to really be able to face the other stuff?
[02:58:20.000 --> 02:58:25.000]  Because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and are also ready to fight.
[02:58:25.000 --> 02:58:28.000]  You don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back.
[02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:30.000]  And I mean, I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future.
[02:58:30.000 --> 02:58:34.000]  I mean, all I know is I want to go with the master built.
[02:58:34.000 --> 02:58:35.000]  I want to go to the next level.
[02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:39.000]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced, not these devil worshipers.
[02:58:39.000 --> 02:58:42.000]  They're cold and failed and feels like being in a tomb.
[02:58:42.000 --> 02:58:43.000]  I want life.
[02:58:43.000 --> 02:58:45.000]  I want Jesus.
[02:58:46.000 --> 02:58:48.000]  I want to say brain force is great.
[02:58:48.000 --> 02:58:50.000]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[02:58:50.000 --> 02:58:51.000]  It is.
[02:58:51.000 --> 02:58:55.000]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[02:58:55.000 --> 02:58:57.000]  The fish oil is better than it.
[02:58:57.000 --> 02:58:59.000]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[02:58:59.000 --> 02:59:04.000]  Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[02:59:04.000 --> 02:59:08.000]  You've got the children's, you've got the adults, you've got the krill oil.
[02:59:08.000 --> 02:59:11.000]  If you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are really strong.
[02:59:11.000 --> 02:59:15.000]  They don't give you the burpees, but krill oil is the best and it'll give you the damn burps.
[02:59:15.000 --> 02:59:18.000]  And I'm sorry, you want something like this, you don't get stuff for free.
[02:59:18.000 --> 02:59:20.000]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[02:59:20.000 --> 02:59:21.000]  It's so good.
[02:59:21.000 --> 02:59:22.000]  In my view.
[02:59:22.000 --> 02:59:23.000]  I'm not a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[02:59:23.000 --> 02:59:26.000]  I eat five capillettes of krill oil before I go to bed.
[02:59:26.000 --> 02:59:28.000]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[02:59:29.000 --> 02:59:34.000]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[02:59:37.000 --> 02:59:40.000]  So we don't make a big profit off of it, but you know what, I just obsess,
[02:59:40.000 --> 02:59:43.000]  because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[02:59:43.000 --> 02:59:45.000]  I just can't do it.
[02:59:49.000 --> 02:59:52.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:59:52.000 --> 02:59:57.000]  Alex Jones show.
[03:00:22.000 --> 03:00:25.000]  I'm going to carry it over and cover it on the war room.
[03:00:25.000 --> 03:00:30.000]  But what I'm really going to do is I'm going to dedicate the three hours of the war room to taking your calls.
[03:00:30.000 --> 03:00:33.000]  So that is on the agenda coming up for the war room.
[03:00:33.000 --> 03:00:38.000]  I'm going to jump out of studio here and then host the war room at info wars.com slash show from three to six.
[03:00:38.000 --> 03:00:40.000]  And we're going to take all your calls.
[03:00:40.000 --> 03:00:42.000]  Will Johnson is going to take over right now though.
[03:00:42.000 --> 03:00:46.000]  Will, fun times, fun times, my friend.
[03:00:46.000 --> 03:00:48.000]  I'm sure you've got a lot to cover.
[03:00:48.000 --> 03:00:50.000]  You are now at the helm of the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:52.000]  This is the proverbial baton toss here.
[03:00:52.000 --> 03:00:54.000]  Let's see if we can do this live on air.
[03:00:54.000 --> 03:00:58.000]  And now Will Johnson has the baton take over my friend.
[03:00:58.000 --> 03:00:59.000]  Thank you.
[03:00:59.000 --> 03:01:00.000]  Thank you.
[03:01:00.000 --> 03:01:01.000]  And you know what?
[03:01:01.000 --> 03:01:02.000]  You know what?
[03:01:02.000 --> 03:01:05.000]  Pepe is just a frog.
[03:01:05.000 --> 03:01:08.000]  Pepe is just a frog.
[03:01:08.000 --> 03:01:10.000]  What is wrong with Pepe?
[03:01:10.000 --> 03:01:17.000]  You know, they want to take Pepe now because Pepe has on a rainbow afro.
[03:01:17.000 --> 03:01:21.000]  Anyways, welcome, welcome. This is the Alex Jones show.
[03:01:21.000 --> 03:01:22.000]  My name is Will Johnson.
[03:01:22.000 --> 03:01:24.000]  I am filling in for the fourth hour.
[03:01:24.000 --> 03:01:25.000]  Thank you, Owen.
[03:01:25.000 --> 03:01:28.000]  So we have a lot to talk about today.
[03:01:28.000 --> 03:01:31.000]  We have craziness of the liberals.
[03:01:31.000 --> 03:01:33.000]  The liberals just get crazier and crazier.
[03:01:33.000 --> 03:01:42.000]  I was just watching Owen and he was showing the crazy leftist there with the crazy makeup on trying to look like a clown.
[03:01:42.000 --> 03:01:46.000]  Be honest with you, these leftist liberals don't need to put on the makeup.
[03:01:46.000 --> 03:01:50.000]  They already fit the part.
[03:01:50.000 --> 03:01:55.000]  It's remarkable that they actually have brain cells left.
[03:01:55.000 --> 03:02:02.000]  And I'm subject to believe that, you know, the brain cells that they have are just, you know, floating around like into oblivious.
[03:02:02.000 --> 03:02:03.000]  There's nothing there.
[03:02:03.000 --> 03:02:06.000]  It's just like empty space.
[03:02:06.000 --> 03:02:10.000]  And, you know, and they exercise their brain cells as much as they can.
[03:02:10.000 --> 03:02:11.000]  It's whatever they have.
[03:02:11.000 --> 03:02:14.000]  It's like they don't even have to rub together.
[03:02:14.000 --> 03:02:16.000]  It's amazing.
[03:02:16.000 --> 03:02:18.000]  But anyways, welcome again.
[03:02:18.000 --> 03:02:31.000]  We are talking about what I'm going to talk about is how the left is attacking conservatives, how the left is they have increased their attacks on conservatives throughout the country.
[03:02:31.000 --> 03:02:38.000]  You have leftists and even the liberal media that won't even acknowledge it.
[03:02:38.000 --> 03:02:42.000]  And they're the ones that's doing all the attacking on American people.
[03:02:42.000 --> 03:02:49.000]  And then they turn around and try to blame it on right wingers or, you know, people that support President Trump.
[03:02:49.000 --> 03:02:53.000]  Anyone in that category, they're the ones that's hateful.
[03:02:53.000 --> 03:02:55.000]  They're the ones that's mean.
[03:02:55.000 --> 03:02:57.000]  No, that is not the case.
[03:02:57.000 --> 03:02:59.000]  It has always been the left.
[03:02:59.000 --> 03:03:03.000]  I've been to multiple rallies, multiple rallies.
[03:03:03.000 --> 03:03:06.000]  I was in Portland.
[03:03:06.000 --> 03:03:08.000]  I was in Berkeley.
[03:03:08.000 --> 03:03:09.000]  I was in LA.
[03:03:09.000 --> 03:03:11.000]  I was in San Diego.
[03:03:11.000 --> 03:03:17.000]  And every single time Trump supporters show up to have a rally, guess who shows up to be violent?
[03:03:17.000 --> 03:03:18.000]  The left.
[03:03:18.000 --> 03:03:26.000]  Every time these leftist groups have rallies, and I've been to multiple leftist rallies, none of us were there throwing rocks at them.
[03:03:26.000 --> 03:03:29.000]  None of us were there trying to hit them with sticks.
[03:03:29.000 --> 03:03:32.000]  None of them, none of us were there trying to knock any of them out.
[03:03:32.000 --> 03:03:35.000]  We didn't have any of that taking place.
[03:03:35.000 --> 03:03:43.000]  It's only when conservatives have a rally or have a gathering, you get the left showing up being violent.
[03:03:43.000 --> 03:03:53.000]  And you know what, Maxine Water, I think she's the ringleader of all of the violence that's taking place against conservatives today, specifically Trump supporters.
[03:03:53.000 --> 03:04:01.000]  And the reason why I say that is because when Maxine Waters came out and said that, you know what, we need to attack them where they are.
[03:04:01.000 --> 03:04:08.000]  When she said that, she was addressing the people that's under the Trump administration, anyone in his cabinet.
[03:04:08.000 --> 03:04:12.000]  She was saying, when you see them out somewhere, attack them.
[03:04:12.000 --> 03:04:14.000]  That's basically what she's saying.
[03:04:14.000 --> 03:04:22.000]  But ultimately, her goal was to get anyone who supports President Trump to be attacked by these leftist, hateful people.
[03:04:22.000 --> 03:04:24.000]  And that's exactly what's taking place.
[03:04:24.000 --> 03:04:29.000]  They have found it in their heart to attack us as Americans.
[03:04:29.000 --> 03:04:32.000]  They find it that it is the proper thing to attack us.
[03:04:32.000 --> 03:04:37.000]  Why? Because they see us as the enemy, because we are in a war.
[03:04:37.000 --> 03:04:41.000]  So after this break, I'm going to show you a clip with Paloma.
[03:04:41.000 --> 03:04:44.000]  Paloma, I'm going to show you the clip with Paloma.
[03:04:44.000 --> 03:04:46.000]  We're going to talk a little bit about that.
[03:04:46.000 --> 03:04:50.000]  My name is Will Johnson, filling for Alex Jones, and this is the Info Wars.
[03:04:50.000 --> 03:04:52.000]  See you in a minute.
[03:04:52.000 --> 03:04:59.000]  And now, through the end of March, we are running the biggest special of this year.
[03:04:59.000 --> 03:05:02.000]  So far, it matches any other special we've ever done.

[03:06:19.000 --> 03:06:22.000]  Alright, welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[03:06:22.000 --> 03:06:24.000]  We have a lot to talk about.
[03:06:24.000 --> 03:06:27.000]  And like I said before the break, I'm going to show you a video clip.
[03:06:27.000 --> 03:06:30.000]  And I had the honor to interview Haloma.
[03:06:30.000 --> 03:06:32.000]  And she's down in Tijuana.
[03:06:32.000 --> 03:06:37.000]  I actually went down to the border with her and experienced some of the stuff that's going on down on the border.
[03:06:37.000 --> 03:06:40.000]  And it is a crisis on the border.
[03:06:40.000 --> 03:06:46.000]  But the reason why I'm talking about her today is because this past weekend she went into a U.S. Postal Office
[03:06:46.000 --> 03:06:50.000]  and basically was verbally attacked and physically attacked.
[03:06:50.000 --> 03:06:52.000]  And I'm going to show this video to you.
[03:06:52.000 --> 03:06:55.000]  And I'm pretty sure a lot of people have seen a lot of this already.
[03:06:55.000 --> 03:07:03.000]  But people need to recognize just like I started off in the program today, there's been multiple attacks on conservatives.
[03:07:03.000 --> 03:07:05.000]  And it has been conservatives.
[03:07:05.000 --> 03:07:07.000]  The conservatives are the ones being attacked.
[03:07:07.000 --> 03:07:08.000]  And you know what?
[03:07:08.000 --> 03:07:10.000]  Just to clarify.
[03:07:10.000 --> 03:07:17.000]  In the past when we had different things going on like Obama became president and what happened after that,
[03:07:17.000 --> 03:07:19.000]  you didn't see conservatives going out burning vehicles.
[03:07:19.000 --> 03:07:23.000]  You didn't see conservatives pulling people out of vehicles, beating them up.
[03:07:23.000 --> 03:07:26.000]  You didn't see conservatives destroying Starbucks.
[03:07:26.000 --> 03:07:32.000]  You didn't see conservatives trying to harm people, throw rocks, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[03:07:32.000 --> 03:07:33.000]  You didn't see it.
[03:07:33.000 --> 03:07:34.000]  Why?
[03:07:34.000 --> 03:07:35.000]  Because it didn't happen.
[03:07:35.000 --> 03:07:42.000]  And if it did happen, you know very well that the Langstream media would be showing it day in, day out.
[03:07:42.000 --> 03:07:44.000]  They wouldn't be only be talking about Charlottesville.
[03:07:44.000 --> 03:07:45.000]  Have you noticed that?
[03:07:45.000 --> 03:07:47.000]  They always bring up Charlottesville.
[03:07:47.000 --> 03:07:51.000]  And now they're going to try to bring up the New Zealand thing, but I digress.
[03:07:51.000 --> 03:07:54.000]  It's the left that's always been violent.
[03:07:54.000 --> 03:07:56.000]  So let me queue up this video for you.
[03:07:56.000 --> 03:08:04.000]  And I'm going to, so you just have to hear it because this is how they think and they've justified it
[03:08:04.000 --> 03:08:09.000]  in their mind that being this way is a good thing.
[03:08:09.000 --> 03:08:11.000]  And it's absolutely not.
[03:08:11.000 --> 03:08:13.000]  It's not good at all.
[03:08:13.000 --> 03:08:14.000]  Okay.
[03:08:14.000 --> 03:08:16.000]  So let me quit yapping and let me get playing it.
[03:08:16.000 --> 03:08:17.000]  Okay.
[03:08:17.000 --> 03:08:44.000]  Here we go.
[03:08:44.000 --> 03:08:55.000]  I have a right not to be harassed.
[03:08:55.000 --> 03:08:58.000]  I have a right not to be harassed.
[03:08:58.000 --> 03:09:01.000]  You have no reason to harass me because of my app.
[03:09:01.000 --> 03:09:02.000]  It doesn't matter.
[03:09:02.000 --> 03:09:05.000]  You have no reason to harass me just because I'm wearing a Trump hat.
[03:09:05.000 --> 03:09:07.000]  What is wrong with you?
[03:09:07.000 --> 03:09:09.000]  Yes, you did.
[03:09:09.000 --> 03:09:10.000]  Yes, you did.
[03:09:10.000 --> 03:09:11.000]  Yes, you did.
[03:09:11.000 --> 03:09:12.000]  I saw it.
[03:09:12.000 --> 03:09:13.000]  Did I see anything?
[03:09:13.000 --> 03:09:14.000]  Yes, you did.
[03:09:14.000 --> 03:09:16.000]  You have no reason to harass me.
[03:09:16.000 --> 03:09:17.000]  Where is the supervisor?
[03:09:17.000 --> 03:09:20.000]  He is the president of America and I should wear whatever I want.
[03:09:20.000 --> 03:09:23.000]  Where is your supervisor?
[03:09:23.000 --> 03:09:24.000]  Exactly.
[03:09:24.000 --> 03:09:27.000]  Do not harass me because of my hat.
[03:09:27.000 --> 03:09:29.000]  I don't care if you don't agree with it.
[03:09:29.000 --> 03:09:30.000]  I have the right to wear it.
[03:09:30.000 --> 03:09:31.000]  I agree.
[03:09:31.000 --> 03:09:32.000]  Okay, racist.
[03:09:32.000 --> 03:09:33.000]  Okay, racist.
[03:09:33.000 --> 03:09:36.000]  I'm a Mexican racist against the white.
[03:09:36.000 --> 03:09:39.000]  I'm a Mexican racist against the white.
[03:09:39.000 --> 03:09:41.000]  I'm wearing a hat.
[03:09:41.000 --> 03:09:44.000]  I'm wearing a Trump hat with the president's name on it.
[03:09:44.000 --> 03:09:45.000]  Look at you shaking.
[03:09:45.000 --> 03:09:46.000]  Get yourself together.
[03:09:46.000 --> 03:09:47.000]  Get yourself together.
[03:09:47.000 --> 03:09:48.000]  Seriously.
[03:09:48.000 --> 03:09:49.000]  Look at you.
[03:09:49.000 --> 03:09:51.000]  Yeah, look at you.
[03:09:51.000 --> 03:09:52.000]  Okay.
[03:09:52.000 --> 03:09:56.000]  Are you there?
[03:09:56.000 --> 03:09:59.000]  Okay.
[03:09:59.000 --> 03:10:01.000]  All right.
[03:10:01.000 --> 03:10:03.000]  Yeah, I apologize for that.
[03:10:03.000 --> 03:10:05.000]  That was on my end.
[03:10:05.000 --> 03:10:06.000]  The audio.
[03:10:06.000 --> 03:10:07.000]  I had to work on that.
[03:10:07.000 --> 03:10:09.000]  I actually fixed it.
[03:10:09.000 --> 03:10:12.000]  Okay, so the whole point is is Laura.
[03:10:12.000 --> 03:10:13.000]  Listen to me.
[03:10:13.000 --> 03:10:17.000]  Paloma went into the US post office while she walking to the post office.
[03:10:17.000 --> 03:10:21.000]  The lady told her that she should be ashamed for wearing that hat.
[03:10:21.000 --> 03:10:22.000]  Seriously.
[03:10:22.000 --> 03:10:24.000]  He is the president of the United States.
[03:10:24.000 --> 03:10:27.000]  You should not be ashamed of wearing the hat.
[03:10:27.000 --> 03:10:30.000]  I mean, I keep my hat with me.
[03:10:30.000 --> 03:10:32.000]  This is my mega hat.
[03:10:32.000 --> 03:10:38.000]  I wear it every time when I go out and you should not be ashamed to wear it.
[03:10:38.000 --> 03:10:40.000]  You should not have that kind of issue.
[03:10:40.000 --> 03:10:43.000]  Anybody should be able to wear anything that they want.
[03:10:43.000 --> 03:10:50.000]  When Obama became president, when he won the election and people had on the Obama clown shirts, it was okay.
[03:10:50.000 --> 03:10:52.000]  No one attacked them.
[03:10:52.000 --> 03:11:00.000]  Not a single time did a conservative go out and attack someone because they had on Obama's shirt or some kind of Obama paraphernalia.
[03:11:00.000 --> 03:11:01.000]  Nothing.
[03:11:01.000 --> 03:11:07.000]  It did not happen because if it did happen and they record it, of course, the liberal media would be showing it.
[03:11:07.000 --> 03:11:08.000]  And do they show it?
[03:11:08.000 --> 03:11:11.000]  No, they don't show it because they don't have it to show.
[03:11:11.000 --> 03:11:13.000]  Because it didn't happen.
[03:11:13.000 --> 03:11:28.000]  And now you probably have like, what I'm surprised in that take place is that you didn't have these liberals trying to act like Trump supporters or at the time right wingers and go out and attack someone with the Obama shirt on.
[03:11:28.000 --> 03:11:36.000]  You see, they didn't think about it then because see, they didn't get absolutely angry until President Trump won the election in 2016.
[03:11:36.000 --> 03:11:38.000]  That's when the anger came to the surface.
[03:11:38.000 --> 03:11:41.000]  That's when we all started seeing what was happening.
[03:11:41.000 --> 03:11:47.000]  And when that started happening, they were like, oh my goodness, President Trump won, Trump won, Trump won.
[03:11:47.000 --> 03:11:49.000]  Now they got to go out on the attack.
[03:11:49.000 --> 03:11:57.000]  There's been multiple instances where they went out and attacked people specifically, specifically just because they're wearing a hat.
[03:11:57.000 --> 03:12:00.000]  That doesn't make any sense.
[03:12:00.000 --> 03:12:05.000]  How are you going to be upset because someone's wearing something that you disagree with?
[03:12:05.000 --> 03:12:10.000]  I mean, I don't agree with BLM and I see them everywhere here in California.
[03:12:10.000 --> 03:12:13.000]  They're constantly wearing, but I don't attack someone.
[03:12:13.000 --> 03:12:15.000]  I don't even verbally attack them.
[03:12:15.000 --> 03:12:17.000]  But you get just the opposite.
[03:12:17.000 --> 03:12:19.000]  So who's the tolerant ones?
[03:12:19.000 --> 03:12:21.000]  It's not liberals.
[03:12:21.000 --> 03:12:24.000]  And they all try to claim that oh, we're so tolerant.
[03:12:24.000 --> 03:12:25.000]  We're inclusive.
[03:12:25.000 --> 03:12:27.000]  We're for everybody.
[03:12:27.000 --> 03:12:30.000]  You're only for the people that's crazy like you.
[03:12:30.000 --> 03:12:32.000]  That is the left.
[03:12:32.000 --> 03:12:34.000]  And that's what we've been seeing.
[03:12:34.000 --> 03:12:36.000]  And we're constantly seeing it.
[03:12:36.000 --> 03:12:43.000]  And for the life of me, some of the, some of the right wing media outlets other than info wars, info wars will talk about it.
[03:12:43.000 --> 03:12:47.000]  But you have some of them that are on the mainstream that won't even talk about it.
[03:12:47.000 --> 03:12:50.000]  Won't even address the issue.
[03:12:50.000 --> 03:12:52.000]  As if it's okay.
[03:12:52.000 --> 03:12:53.000]  This is the norm.
[03:12:53.000 --> 03:12:55.000]  This is supposed to happen.
[03:12:55.000 --> 03:12:56.000]  It's not normal.
[03:12:56.000 --> 03:12:59.000]  It's not supposed to happen.
[03:12:59.000 --> 03:13:06.000]  People are in America and, for example, if I went out and stood on a corner holding the American flag,
[03:13:06.000 --> 03:13:14.000]  don't send me a message telling me that I'm inciting violence for standing on the corner in the United States holding the American flag.
[03:13:14.000 --> 03:13:16.000]  It doesn't work that way.
[03:13:16.000 --> 03:13:18.000]  That's not how it's supposed to happen.
[03:13:18.000 --> 03:13:22.000]  You're supposed to say, huh, huh, yes, America, but you don't get that.
[03:13:22.000 --> 03:13:25.000]  You get just the opposite.
[03:13:25.000 --> 03:13:28.000]  And it's absolutely disgusting.
[03:13:28.000 --> 03:13:30.000]  I'm an American citizen.
[03:13:30.000 --> 03:13:36.000]  And I love this country and I would do anything to keep this country the way it is because it is great.
[03:13:36.000 --> 03:13:41.000]  And come 2020, voting for President Trump will keep America great.
[03:13:41.000 --> 03:13:43.000]  And the liberals can't stand it.
[03:13:43.000 --> 03:13:45.000]  That's why we are at war.
[03:13:45.000 --> 03:13:46.000]  It's a spiritual war.
[03:13:46.000 --> 03:13:49.000]  The liberal media is at war with the American people.
[03:13:49.000 --> 03:13:50.000]  Why?
[03:13:50.000 --> 03:13:53.000]  Because they don't like President Trump.
[03:13:53.000 --> 03:13:59.000]  They are willing to destroy this country because they hate the President of the United States.
[03:13:59.000 --> 03:14:03.000]  Have you ever heard such a thing before?
[03:14:03.000 --> 03:14:06.000]  Never, never.
[03:14:06.000 --> 03:14:08.000]  It happens.
[03:14:08.000 --> 03:14:12.000]  It only happens because the left is showing it to happen.
[03:14:12.000 --> 03:14:14.000]  Why is it happening now?
[03:14:14.000 --> 03:14:19.000]  You were thinking in the year 2019 that we could be so much more civil, right?
[03:14:19.000 --> 03:14:21.000]  We're supposed to be a civilized nation.
[03:14:21.000 --> 03:14:23.000]  We're not supposed to be third world nation.
[03:14:23.000 --> 03:14:27.000]  We're not supposed to be crazy about the nation, right?
[03:14:27.000 --> 03:14:31.000]  But people walk outside and they wear a Trump hat and you get attacked.
[03:14:31.000 --> 03:14:33.000]  You wear a mega hat and you get attacked.
[03:14:33.000 --> 03:14:36.000]  There's been multiple times it happens.
[03:14:36.000 --> 03:14:44.000]  I mean, so to give you another example, I have here there was a woman charged for attacking a man in a mega hat in a restaurant.
[03:14:44.000 --> 03:14:49.000]  And then ICE decided to arrest them, arrest her, arrest the lady.
[03:14:49.000 --> 03:14:56.000]  Same thing. There's another incident where an 80 year old man in Jersey.
[03:14:56.000 --> 03:15:04.000]  New Jersey, 81 years old was assaulted by a leftist because he was wearing a mega hat.
[03:15:04.000 --> 03:15:07.000]  Does that make sense to you?
[03:15:07.000 --> 03:15:09.000]  I mean, seriously, it's the old man.
[03:15:09.000 --> 03:15:10.000]  They're the old man alone.
[03:15:10.000 --> 03:15:12.000]  But see, they can't help themselves.
[03:15:12.000 --> 03:15:16.000]  They go based on their feelings.
[03:15:16.000 --> 03:15:21.000]  The old man you see on the screen now, he was in here in California.
[03:15:21.000 --> 03:15:23.000]  He was attacked.
[03:15:23.000 --> 03:15:24.000]  Why?
[03:15:24.000 --> 03:15:26.000]  Because he's wearing a mega hat.
[03:15:26.000 --> 03:15:28.000]  It should not happen.
[03:15:28.000 --> 03:15:30.000]  We are Americans.
[03:15:30.000 --> 03:15:33.000]  We have freedom and people are going to fight for the freedom.
[03:15:33.000 --> 03:15:36.000]  The young in the old.
[03:15:36.000 --> 03:15:38.000]  My name is Will Johnson.
[03:15:38.000 --> 03:15:40.000]  You are watching the Alex Jones show.

[03:19:56.000 --> 03:20:14.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:20:14.000 --> 03:20:17.000]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[03:20:17.000 --> 03:20:25.000]  It is the Alex Jones show with Will Johnson.
[03:20:25.000 --> 03:20:28.000]  And welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[03:20:28.000 --> 03:20:30.000]  My name is Will Johnson.
[03:20:30.000 --> 03:20:37.000]  So, I was talking about being attacked by the left.
[03:20:37.000 --> 03:20:43.000]  Being attacked by liberals in the mainstream media is not talking about it.
[03:20:43.000 --> 03:20:49.000]  Why? Because they want people to believe that white nationalists, white supremacists,
[03:20:49.000 --> 03:20:54.000]  white people are on the uprise to destroy America,
[03:20:54.000 --> 03:20:59.000]  which is completely crazy if you really think about it, right?
[03:20:59.000 --> 03:21:04.000]  Because you hear a lot of people on the left said that America is a white country.
[03:21:04.000 --> 03:21:09.000]  So, why would people want to rise and destroy the country that's already white?
[03:21:09.000 --> 03:21:14.000]  I mean, really? I mean, it's like...
[03:21:14.000 --> 03:21:17.000]  I mean, really, did anyone ever think about that?
[03:21:17.000 --> 03:21:22.000]  So, the main reason why they're saying that is because Obama was president, a black man,
[03:21:22.000 --> 03:21:25.000]  if you want to say that he was really black.
[03:21:25.000 --> 03:21:31.000]  And it's not that white people are attacking people that are conservatives,
[03:21:31.000 --> 03:21:35.000]  but there are white people that are liberals attacking people.
[03:21:35.000 --> 03:21:39.000]  I mean, there's liberals attacking black people.
[03:21:39.000 --> 03:21:42.000]  There's liberals that's attacking white people.
[03:21:42.000 --> 03:21:45.000]  There are liberals attacking Hispanics and Asians.
[03:21:45.000 --> 03:21:48.000]  Liberals, the common denominator, are liberals.
[03:21:48.000 --> 03:21:50.000]  They attack everybody.
[03:21:50.000 --> 03:21:54.000]  If you don't think like they do, they will find some kind of way to attack you.
[03:21:54.000 --> 03:21:57.000]  And it doesn't always have to be physical.
[03:21:57.000 --> 03:22:01.000]  They start off being verbally abusive to people.
[03:22:01.000 --> 03:22:04.000]  They start off that way and they're excited about it.
[03:22:04.000 --> 03:22:11.000]  And they feel that they have this justice about them, that they have to fight the nationalists
[03:22:11.000 --> 03:22:15.000]  and the fascists and the white supremacists.
[03:22:15.000 --> 03:22:19.000]  And naturally, they're the ones that's the fascists.
[03:22:19.000 --> 03:22:25.000]  They're the ones who, with all the supremacy against the people who don't agree with them,
[03:22:25.000 --> 03:22:28.000]  they're the ones that's doing all of it.
[03:22:28.000 --> 03:22:32.000]  So, there's a gentleman here named Jeffrey.
[03:22:32.000 --> 03:22:40.000]  He actually went to an event this past weekend.
[03:22:40.000 --> 03:22:44.000]  And I'm going to show a video of him where he confronted these people.
[03:22:44.000 --> 03:22:46.000]  And this is, let me show it.
[03:22:46.000 --> 03:22:49.000]  I have the article here.
[03:22:49.000 --> 03:22:51.000]  He actually sent me a screenshot.
[03:22:51.000 --> 03:22:56.000]  This was at a First United Methodist Church in Loomis, California,
[03:22:56.000 --> 03:23:01.000]  which is kind of interesting to me that the church is teaching people how to break the law.
[03:23:01.000 --> 03:23:06.000]  I'm kind of confused by that.
[03:23:06.000 --> 03:23:12.000]  I mean, at some point, you would think that these people that believe in God would follow the laws.
[03:23:12.000 --> 03:23:14.000]  That's the right thing to do.
[03:23:14.000 --> 03:23:17.000]  God teaches us to do the right thing.
[03:23:17.000 --> 03:23:24.000]  So, I'm subject to believe anything that's coming out of this church or other churches just like it.
[03:23:24.000 --> 03:23:27.000]  But anyways, he went into this place.
[03:23:27.000 --> 03:23:33.000]  And one of the questions they were asking, he asked, was about the number,
[03:23:33.000 --> 03:23:37.000]  the quota coming into the America coming into the border.
[03:23:37.000 --> 03:23:40.000]  How many people should we allow to come in?
[03:23:40.000 --> 03:23:43.000]  I mean, so that is a valid question.
[03:23:43.000 --> 03:23:45.000]  The question is, when do we stop?
[03:23:45.000 --> 03:23:46.000]  Is it a million?
[03:23:46.000 --> 03:23:47.000]  Is it two million?
[03:23:47.000 --> 03:23:49.000]  Is it 50 million?
[03:23:49.000 --> 03:23:53.000]  Right now, it's the UN trying to bring in people into the country.
[03:23:53.000 --> 03:23:56.000]  And I truly believe that it's an invasion.
[03:23:56.000 --> 03:23:58.000]  And it is a war tactic.
[03:23:58.000 --> 03:24:06.000]  And I think the left is using these leftists as a tactic to attack us.
[03:24:06.000 --> 03:24:12.000]  So, it was the United Methodist Church, the first United Methodist Church.
[03:24:12.000 --> 03:24:25.000]  And they're sending these people in to attack us on a different front, various fronts in Texas, California.
[03:24:25.000 --> 03:24:27.000]  And they're bringing all these people in.
[03:24:27.000 --> 03:24:31.000]  So, what happened at this event, he just asked a simple question.
[03:24:31.000 --> 03:24:33.000]  He was just asking the question.
[03:24:33.000 --> 03:24:39.000]  And when he went to ask the question, they decided to attack him.
[03:24:39.000 --> 03:24:46.000]  The event, this event that he went to was supposed to be for immigration,
[03:24:46.000 --> 03:24:49.000]  a place for education to advocate.
[03:24:49.000 --> 03:24:54.000]  So, they're basically teaching people on how to beat the system, how to get over the system,
[03:24:54.000 --> 03:24:57.000]  how to get by, how to manipulate.
[03:24:57.000 --> 03:25:00.000]  I mean, it's the same thing that they do when I went down to Tijuana.
[03:25:00.000 --> 03:25:05.000]  When I was down in Tijuana, you had these leftists with the green hats on, the Lord's Guild,
[03:25:05.000 --> 03:25:10.000]  teaching people what to say and what they should do.
[03:25:10.000 --> 03:25:13.000]  So, without further ado, let me get this video over here.
[03:25:13.000 --> 03:25:15.000]  And this time I have my audio correct.
[03:25:15.000 --> 03:25:20.000]  And let's just watch it's just a minute clip and we're going to talk about it.
[03:25:20.000 --> 03:25:23.000]  Would you want to answer one question of opposition, please?
[03:25:23.000 --> 03:25:27.000]  I respectfully just waited and want to ask one question, please.
[03:25:27.000 --> 03:25:34.000]  I heard the question from the customs woman about the quota and how it's at one million,
[03:25:34.000 --> 03:25:37.000]  which is more than any other country in the world, right?
[03:25:37.000 --> 03:25:41.000]  And what about the 150,000 people that came in last month?
[03:25:41.000 --> 03:25:47.000]  I just, I understand there's a quota, but you have to realize that we have a border problem right now.
[03:25:47.000 --> 03:25:50.000]  And I understand that, may I finish, please?
[03:25:50.000 --> 03:25:56.000]  I'm just saying, what I'm getting at is if we have a quota, really, really good.
[03:25:56.000 --> 03:25:57.000]  They assaulted him.
[03:25:57.000 --> 03:25:58.000]  Really, dude?
[03:25:58.000 --> 03:26:00.000]  Now I'm being physically attacked.
[03:26:00.000 --> 03:26:08.000]  If I'm on a live, if I'm on a live video, if I'm on a live video, I've just been physically attacked, right?
[03:26:08.000 --> 03:26:10.000]  Leave the premise.
[03:26:10.000 --> 03:26:12.000]  Alright, so what you're doing is you're physically assaulting me.
[03:26:12.000 --> 03:26:15.000]  No, I'm starting you off with the property.
[03:26:15.000 --> 03:26:16.000]  I was never asked to leave.
[03:26:16.000 --> 03:26:17.000]  This is private property?
[03:26:17.000 --> 03:26:19.000]  Alright, alright, alright, I see what you're doing.
[03:26:19.000 --> 03:26:21.000]  See, that's what you get.
[03:26:21.000 --> 03:26:23.000]  That's exactly what you get.
[03:26:23.000 --> 03:26:25.000]  He wasn't being disruptive.
[03:26:25.000 --> 03:26:27.000]  He wasn't being loud.
[03:26:27.000 --> 03:26:35.000]  And they attacked him simply because he was asking the question and he brought it to their attention that there is a crisis on the border.
[03:26:35.000 --> 03:26:37.000]  Really?
[03:26:37.000 --> 03:26:39.000]  It just proves my point.
[03:26:39.000 --> 03:26:44.000]  You can be a conservative and ask polite questions and still get attacked.
[03:26:44.000 --> 03:26:51.000]  It doesn't matter because you don't think like these leftist liberals, they are going to attack you.
[03:26:51.000 --> 03:26:57.000]  And I guarantee that the mainstream media is not going to talk about it.
[03:26:57.000 --> 03:26:59.000]  Zero, not a zip.
[03:26:59.000 --> 03:27:05.000]  They never do because they're complicit with the Democrats on pushing this whole narrative that it's the right-wingers.
[03:27:05.000 --> 03:27:13.000]  They even have TV shows on Netflix, on other various channels where they're saying people on the right
[03:27:13.000 --> 03:27:17.000]  are domestic terrorists when the left is the one that's domestic terrorists.
[03:27:17.000 --> 03:27:24.000]  Antifa, BLM, and BAM, they are the foot soldiers for the Democrat terrorist party in America.
[03:27:24.000 --> 03:27:25.000]  They are.
[03:27:25.000 --> 03:27:30.000]  They're the foot soldiers because the Democrats will say stuff and guess what happens?
[03:27:30.000 --> 03:27:34.000]  It trickles down to the lamestream media and then the lamestream media puts it out there.
[03:27:34.000 --> 03:27:42.000]  And then Antifa, BLM, and BAM and the rest of these anti-American hate groups will go out there and run with it and start attacking conservatives.
[03:27:42.000 --> 03:27:50.000]  There's not enough being said, there's not enough being said about the left attacking conservatives.
[03:27:50.000 --> 03:27:57.000]  I went to a Kevin De Leon event here in California and I confronted Kevin De Leon and I asked him,
[03:27:57.000 --> 03:28:00.000]  why is he putting illegals before the American people?
[03:28:00.000 --> 03:28:03.000]  And there was roughly about 200 people in this room.
[03:28:03.000 --> 03:28:11.000]  And while I was there, I noticed that I'm the only black male in the room.
[03:28:11.000 --> 03:28:16.000]  The only black male in the room and the rest of them are white and guess who they attacked?
[03:28:16.000 --> 03:28:17.000]  Me.
[03:28:17.000 --> 03:28:19.000]  Because I'm the only Trump supporter.
[03:28:19.000 --> 03:28:20.000]  Amazing.
[03:28:20.000 --> 03:28:22.000]  Amazing.
[03:28:22.000 --> 03:28:24.000]  Amazing.
[03:28:24.000 --> 03:28:26.000]  My name is Will Johnson.

[03:32:00.000 --> 03:32:06.000]  It's about who wants it, who's prepared to go the longest, and who's ready to do the damage.
[03:32:06.000 --> 03:32:10.000]  We took on Hillary Clinton. We stopped her. We got a national stand.
[03:32:10.000 --> 03:32:14.000]  Nationalists are getting elected all over the world right now. We are winning.

[03:33:40.000 --> 03:33:50.000]  Move, bitch! Get out the way! We pledge allegiance to one flag and that flag is the American flag.
[03:33:50.000 --> 03:33:54.000]  Infowars helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[03:33:54.000 --> 03:34:04.000]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning. I will not let you down. You'll be very, very impressed, I hope, and I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[03:34:04.000 --> 03:34:12.000]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones. This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[03:34:12.000 --> 03:34:18.000]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones.
[03:34:18.000 --> 03:34:23.000]  Welcome back. My name is Will Johnson and this is the Alex Jones show.
[03:34:23.000 --> 03:34:31.000]  Before we get started, I want to bring something to your attention that I thought was absolutely phenomenal that Infowars is doing.
[03:34:31.000 --> 03:34:41.000]  To help bring... One of the things is how Infowars functions and everyone here, Alex Jones says it, when you support Infowars.com.
[03:34:41.000 --> 03:34:47.000]  You go to Infowars.com for its last show and go to InfowarsStore.com.
[03:34:47.000 --> 03:34:55.000]  When you support Infowars, we're being at the tip of the spear in this global battle, in this fight that we're all fighting.
[03:34:55.000 --> 03:35:12.000]  That's one way that you can do it. To help save big and with a limited time on mega sales on top of the 60% off of Infowars life specials with free shipping and double-patriot points.
[03:35:12.000 --> 03:35:16.000]  You can't pass that up. I mean, seriously, who could pass it up?
[03:35:16.000 --> 03:35:25.000]  The fan favorite special is 55% off Survival Shield X2 and it's back in stock.
[03:35:25.000 --> 03:35:28.000]  Gotta get it now. Gotta get it now for a run out.
[03:35:28.000 --> 03:35:36.000]  Also, one of the ones I really love that I get at Infowars, I purchase this all the time, is the Brain Force.
[03:35:36.000 --> 03:35:39.000]  Now, my new favorite is the Turbo Force.
[03:35:39.000 --> 03:35:49.000]  But then also, they have so many different products. It is unbelievable and that's part of the reason why they are attacking Infowars the way they are.
[03:35:49.000 --> 03:35:59.000]  Just think about it. I've been talking about it an entire show. They're attacking Infowars and they don't like what Alex Jones is doing because he's waking people up.
[03:35:59.000 --> 03:36:02.000]  And they can't have that. They want people to stay asleep.
[03:36:02.000 --> 03:36:12.000]  And when you have super mail vitality, you know, the super blue products, gotta get them if nothing else, get it and try it.
[03:36:12.000 --> 03:36:18.000]  And then tell your friends about it and even go look at the reviews that they have on the store.
[03:36:18.000 --> 03:36:25.000]  Go look at the reviews. Some of them, I mean, they're honest people putting their information out there and how it's working for them.
[03:36:25.000 --> 03:36:32.000]  Alright, cool. So I've been talking about how the left is attacking conservatives.
[03:36:32.000 --> 03:36:42.000]  And main reason I'm talking about it is because we don't have enough people talking about it in the mainstream media or even the mainstream media period.
[03:36:42.000 --> 03:36:51.000]  The only place you ever hear anything that's actually happening to the American people on a ground level is Infowars.com.
[03:36:51.000 --> 03:36:58.000]  You ever think about that? How come you don't hear stuff that's actually happening on the ground level in the mainstream media?
[03:36:58.000 --> 03:37:07.000]  Why? Because they have an agenda that they're pushing and thousands upon thousands, actually millions of people.
[03:37:07.000 --> 03:37:16.000]  I'm being conservative. Millions of people actually go to Infowars.com and look at what's happening across the world and in America.
[03:37:16.000 --> 03:37:23.000]  And people are waking up. That's why they're attacking Infowars the way they are.
[03:37:23.000 --> 03:37:32.000]  So I have one more clip that I'm going to play. I may play this segment or the next one. It just depends.
[03:37:32.000 --> 03:37:49.000]  When we have the left dreaming up things about white people and how white people are going along with it, that should be a wake up call to a lot of white people.
[03:37:49.000 --> 03:37:58.000]  It dawned on me the other day. I'm sitting there talking to someone and they had this white person saying that, you know, white people are the problem.
[03:37:58.000 --> 03:38:04.000]  And then you even had Joe Biden come out and say, you know, white men are the problem.
[03:38:04.000 --> 03:38:15.000]  Did you ever think that you would have an ex-vice president go on national television and say that white men, specifically white men.
[03:38:15.000 --> 03:38:21.000]  He's talking about white people and he's white. What is it about white people that white people don't like?
[03:38:21.000 --> 03:38:31.000]  And all of the white people that are alive today, they don't have, they've never owned a slave. The black people living in America today have never been slaves.
[03:38:31.000 --> 03:38:40.000]  And they escaped recently from Africa because you have Muslims in Africa enslaving people today, black people.
[03:38:40.000 --> 03:38:47.000]  And that's okay when it comes to the left. But you have Joe Biden saying white people are the problem.
[03:38:47.000 --> 03:38:51.000]  You have the lamestream media saying that white people are the problem.
[03:38:51.000 --> 03:38:57.000]  And why is it a black man, such as myself, can come on here and say white people are not the problem.
[03:38:57.000 --> 03:39:05.000]  And then I get white and black people trying to demonize me, say something's wrong with me because I say white people are not the problem.
[03:39:05.000 --> 03:39:13.000]  Does it make sense? Just think about that. I mean, it's not, it don't even sound right.
[03:39:13.000 --> 03:39:20.000]  For me to be a black man saying white people are not the problem and then you have white people coming at me saying you're wrong.
[03:39:20.000 --> 03:39:26.000]  That don't even sound right. My God, what's wrong with these people?
[03:39:26.000 --> 03:39:34.000]  What it is, a lot of it is white guilt. These white liberals, they have white guilt because they're Democrats.
[03:39:34.000 --> 03:39:40.000]  And it's the Democrats that want to keep people enslaved. It's the Democrats that enslaved black people.
[03:39:40.000 --> 03:39:45.000]  It's the Democrats that didn't want women to vote. It's the Democrats that was against the civil rights.
[03:39:45.000 --> 03:39:51.000]  It was the Democrats that created the KKK. So these white people that are Democrats still supporting this.
[03:39:51.000 --> 03:39:57.000]  All these Democrat policies, they have the white guilt probably because they're supporting Democrats.
[03:39:57.000 --> 03:40:05.000]  Get out of the Democrat Party. Stop falling for it. What is your reasoning behind it?
[03:40:05.000 --> 03:40:11.000]  Does it help? It doesn't help. All it's doing is creating division. And I love how they sit there and say that President Trump,
[03:40:11.000 --> 03:40:17.000]  because he's white, he's racist, just simply because he was born white.
[03:40:17.000 --> 03:40:21.000]  That's the reason why they say he's racist because he's born white and he's a billionaire.
[03:40:21.000 --> 03:40:28.000]  So he must be racist, but not a single one of them was saying that before he became president.
[03:40:28.000 --> 03:40:35.000]  And the lamestream media keep putting it out there, keep putting it out there, and we're supposed to believe it.
[03:40:35.000 --> 03:40:43.000]  We're supposed to believe that he's all of a sudden racist because he's white.
[03:40:43.000 --> 03:40:52.000]  What other country, think about it, what other country that goes out and says that white people are the problem?
[03:40:52.000 --> 03:41:01.000]  I can give you one. It's not even a country, I guess you would say, it's a continent, South Africa.
[03:41:01.000 --> 03:41:10.000]  Genocide of white people is happening at an alarming rate in South Africa, and you have the lamestream media not talking about it.
[03:41:10.000 --> 03:41:17.000]  It's like some reason they have it fixed in their head that white people deserve this.
[03:41:17.000 --> 03:41:22.000]  At what point do people, period, anywhere on the planet deserve this?
[03:41:22.000 --> 03:41:25.000]  You have Muslims killing Christians.
[03:41:25.000 --> 03:41:33.000]  And for some reason, even in the United States, they associate Christianity with just white people.
[03:41:33.000 --> 03:41:46.000]  But that's not the case. Christianity is not a color. Christianity is a way of life, but they attack everybody because they don't think like them.
[03:41:46.000 --> 03:41:52.000]  This whole thing, what I've been talking about is how the left attack everybody because they don't think like them.
[03:41:52.000 --> 03:41:54.000]  I'll give you another example.
[03:41:54.000 --> 03:42:04.000]  Here in the state of California, they're trying to make it to where they put people in prison if you don't agree that this grown man over here is a woman.
[03:42:04.000 --> 03:42:07.000]  Do you hear me?
[03:42:07.000 --> 03:42:14.000]  Not only that, here in the state of California, they're pushing stuff to where they're trying to justify pedophilia.
[03:42:14.000 --> 03:42:18.000]  That's probably why they're okay with Joe for the most part.
[03:42:18.000 --> 03:42:25.000]  They're okay with his acts, but they want to remove Joe because they don't want a white man to be president.
[03:42:25.000 --> 03:42:27.000]  They want someone else.
[03:42:27.000 --> 03:42:31.000]  My name is Will Johnson. This is the Alex Jones show.
[03:42:31.000 --> 03:42:34.000]  I'm going to play the clip when we come back.

[03:43:08.000 --> 03:43:10.000]  This deal just happened about a month ago.

[03:43:11.000 --> 03:43:12.000]  It's been bottled.
[03:43:12.000 --> 03:43:14.000]  The labels are being put on today.
[03:43:14.000 --> 03:43:19.000]  And then it's going to be on an 18-wheeler right here to Austin from the plant in the Rockies.

[03:43:41.000 --> 03:43:43.000]  They should write the supplements.
[03:43:43.000 --> 03:43:46.000]  And this is the King Daddy, ladies and gentlemen.

[03:44:53.000 --> 03:44:56.000]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[03:44:56.000 --> 03:44:57.000]  Go ahead.
[03:44:57.000 --> 03:44:59.000]  I just have to say something, man.
[03:44:59.000 --> 03:45:02.000]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[03:45:02.000 --> 03:45:04.000]  It just gets old now.
[03:45:04.000 --> 03:45:06.000]  I'm going to shut you down right now.
[03:45:06.000 --> 03:45:08.000]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[03:45:08.000 --> 03:45:13.000]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[03:45:13.000 --> 03:45:15.000]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[03:45:15.000 --> 03:45:18.000]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[03:45:18.000 --> 03:45:20.000]  I mean, what's it going to take?
[03:45:20.000 --> 03:45:21.000]  Us being shut down?
[03:45:21.000 --> 03:45:22.000]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[03:45:22.000 --> 03:45:23.000]  You know what?
[03:45:23.000 --> 03:45:25.000]  I'll put it on pause again.
[03:45:25.000 --> 03:45:26.000]  Hey, Frank!
[03:45:26.000 --> 03:45:28.000]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say,
[03:45:28.000 --> 03:45:29.000]  we are the tip of the spear.
[03:45:29.000 --> 03:45:30.000]  We're under attack.
[03:45:30.000 --> 03:45:31.000]  We need your help.
[03:45:31.000 --> 03:45:34.000]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills
[03:45:34.000 --> 03:45:36.000]  and grow in the face of this.
[03:45:36.000 --> 03:45:37.000]  I'm not going to just stop growth
[03:45:37.000 --> 03:45:39.000]  and let them start pushing us backwards.
[03:45:39.000 --> 03:45:41.000]  You understand I need your help, Frank?
[03:45:41.000 --> 03:45:43.000]  I need your help, Frank!

[03:46:03.000 --> 03:46:05.000]  By leaps and by bounds,

[03:46:12.000 --> 03:46:15.000]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins
[03:46:15.000 --> 03:46:17.000]  and synthetic caffeine and other chemicals
[03:46:17.000 --> 03:46:19.000]  that sure get you a quick boost
[03:46:19.000 --> 03:46:21.000]  but burn out in just a few hours
[03:46:21.000 --> 03:46:22.000]  and have terrible side effects.
[03:46:22.000 --> 03:46:25.000]  We have developed, hands down from our research,
[03:46:25.000 --> 03:46:28.000]  the most powerful, healthy energy drink,

[03:46:31.000 --> 03:46:33.000]  If there's nothing else like it,
[03:46:33.000 --> 03:46:34.000]  you must experience it.
[03:46:34.000 --> 03:46:36.000]  It is a total game changer
[03:46:36.000 --> 03:46:39.000]  and it comes in easy to use, packaged, mixed with fruit juice,
[03:46:39.000 --> 03:46:41.000]  or water, whatever you'd like.
[03:46:41.000 --> 03:46:43.000]  Warning though, it's very, very strong,
[03:46:43.000 --> 03:46:44.000]  it lasts 10 hours,
[03:46:44.000 --> 03:46:46.000]  so take a half packet the first time you take it
[03:46:46.000 --> 03:46:48.000]  because TurboForce is named TurboForce
[03:46:48.000 --> 03:46:50.000]  because it will take you into overdrive.
[03:46:50.000 --> 03:47:06.000]  TurboForce and EnforceLive.com
[03:47:21.000 --> 03:47:25.000]  And now, your host, Will Johnson.
[03:47:25.000 --> 03:47:29.000]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[03:47:29.000 --> 03:47:31.000]  My name is Will Johnson.
[03:47:31.000 --> 03:47:35.000]  We've been talking about the left attacking conservatives,
[03:47:35.000 --> 03:47:38.000]  constantly attacking conservatives
[03:47:38.000 --> 03:47:40.000]  to the point to where they're sending people out
[03:47:40.000 --> 03:47:42.000]  to attack more conservatives.
[03:47:42.000 --> 03:47:46.000]  It's like a reoccurring thing with the left now.
[03:47:46.000 --> 03:47:49.000]  They've made it like their goal,
[03:47:49.000 --> 03:47:52.000]  their plan, their objective to attack conservatives.
[03:47:52.000 --> 03:47:55.000]  The last segment I was talking about how they,
[03:47:55.000 --> 03:47:57.000]  like even like Joe Biden,
[03:47:57.000 --> 03:48:00.000]  being vice president saying that white people are the problem
[03:48:00.000 --> 03:48:02.000]  of white men and he's a white man himself,
[03:48:02.000 --> 03:48:05.000]  so you would think why would they vote for him
[03:48:05.000 --> 03:48:07.000]  or even support him because he's a white man,
[03:48:07.000 --> 03:48:10.000]  but yet he's like gearing up to be president.
[03:48:10.000 --> 03:48:14.000]  I mean, anyone put that together?
[03:48:14.000 --> 03:48:16.000]  Has anybody put that together?
[03:48:16.000 --> 03:48:18.000]  Did anybody else put that together?
[03:48:18.000 --> 03:48:20.000]  He said, white men are the problem
[03:48:20.000 --> 03:48:22.000]  and he's getting ready to gear up.
[03:48:22.000 --> 03:48:24.000]  I mean, it really looks that way,
[03:48:24.000 --> 03:48:29.000]  but with all the whole touchy, filly, sniffing,
[03:48:29.000 --> 03:48:36.000]  I don't know that he's going to actually put his name in the hat.
[03:48:36.000 --> 03:48:41.000]  Then again, he may because he is who he is.
[03:48:41.000 --> 03:48:43.000]  I mean, groping Joe.
[03:48:43.000 --> 03:48:44.000]  Look at that.
[03:48:44.000 --> 03:48:46.000]  Groping Joe.
[03:48:46.000 --> 03:48:48.000]  He'll grop himself.
[03:48:48.000 --> 03:48:51.000]  And then what was really amazing about that clip
[03:48:51.000 --> 03:48:55.000]  with Joe groping himself is that the left got upset
[03:48:55.000 --> 03:48:57.000]  about Joe groping himself,
[03:48:57.000 --> 03:49:01.000]  but it's okay for him to grop other people
[03:49:01.000 --> 03:49:03.000]  he don't even know.
[03:49:03.000 --> 03:49:05.000]  I mean, seriously, but anyways,
[03:49:05.000 --> 03:49:11.000]  I was talking about how the left is attacking white people.
[03:49:11.000 --> 03:49:17.000]  I like to talk about how black people are still falling
[03:49:17.000 --> 03:49:19.000]  for the Democrat laws.
[03:49:19.000 --> 03:49:21.000]  And it's not just black people falling for it.
[03:49:21.000 --> 03:49:24.000]  You have white people, Asian people, Latinos.
[03:49:24.000 --> 03:49:27.000]  They fall for it too.
[03:49:27.000 --> 03:49:30.000]  I mean, we've been falling for it for the longest.
[03:49:30.000 --> 03:49:36.000]  Sadly to say I used to be a demon crack.
[03:49:36.000 --> 03:49:38.000]  God woke me up.
[03:49:38.000 --> 03:49:41.000]  No longer will I ever, ever in my entire life,
[03:49:41.000 --> 03:49:44.000]  support a demon crack.
[03:49:44.000 --> 03:49:46.000]  Never again.
[03:49:46.000 --> 03:49:47.000]  I don't care.
[03:49:47.000 --> 03:49:50.000]  I would, I would support a crooked Republican
[03:49:50.000 --> 03:49:52.000]  over a demon crack.
[03:49:52.000 --> 03:49:54.000]  It's sad to say.
[03:49:54.000 --> 03:49:56.000]  Because these, these Democrats,
[03:49:56.000 --> 03:50:00.000]  they do not have the best interest for America.
[03:50:00.000 --> 03:50:03.000]  They're trying to undermine the president of the United States.
[03:50:03.000 --> 03:50:04.000]  They're trying to destroy us, right?
[03:50:04.000 --> 03:50:06.000]  But I digress.
[03:50:06.000 --> 03:50:08.000]  Black people.
[03:50:08.000 --> 03:50:11.000]  When you have black people that just blindly follow
[03:50:11.000 --> 03:50:16.000]  the Democrat party for no apparent reason.
[03:50:16.000 --> 03:50:18.000]  And then when you have President Trump comes to come and say,
[03:50:18.000 --> 03:50:20.000]  what the, you got to lose?
[03:50:20.000 --> 03:50:21.000]  ATL.
[03:50:21.000 --> 03:50:23.000]  What do you have to lose?
[03:50:23.000 --> 03:50:25.000]  A lot of black people are like, well, you know what?
[03:50:25.000 --> 03:50:26.000]  He has a point.
[03:50:26.000 --> 03:50:28.000]  What do we have to lose?
[03:50:28.000 --> 03:50:31.000]  We haven't gained anything by following the Democrats.
[03:50:31.000 --> 03:50:33.000]  And the Democrats have, by design,
[03:50:33.000 --> 03:50:40.000]  they have been keeping black people under their boot forever.
[03:50:40.000 --> 03:50:42.000]  By design.
[03:50:42.000 --> 03:50:44.000]  And they're very good at it.
[03:50:44.000 --> 03:50:47.000]  Because it's working.
[03:50:47.000 --> 03:50:52.000]  I saw, I saw a CNN clip where they were talking about on CNN
[03:50:52.000 --> 03:50:55.000]  talking about how they don't even really address the black male
[03:50:55.000 --> 03:50:59.000]  any longer, because black males are starting to leave the Democrat
[03:50:59.000 --> 03:51:00.000]  party.
[03:51:00.000 --> 03:51:02.000]  This was on CNN.
[03:51:02.000 --> 03:51:04.000]  And I'm sitting there listening to it.
[03:51:04.000 --> 03:51:06.000]  And then it came and said that, well,
[03:51:06.000 --> 03:51:10.000]  we don't have to worry about losing the black woman.
[03:51:10.000 --> 03:51:13.000]  Basically, they said, we own the black woman.
[03:51:13.000 --> 03:51:16.000]  And I'm like, my goodness.
[03:51:16.000 --> 03:51:20.000]  And I'm upset because I don't have the video recording on that.
[03:51:20.000 --> 03:51:21.000]  I'm upset.
[03:51:21.000 --> 03:51:24.000]  So a lot of people say, if you don't have the video recording on it,
[03:51:24.000 --> 03:51:25.000]  it didn't happen.
[03:51:25.000 --> 03:51:27.000]  You know, CNN will say it too.
[03:51:27.000 --> 03:51:30.000]  But then a lot of times you can take a video clip and make three
[03:51:30.000 --> 03:51:32.000]  seconds out of it and say, oh, this is it right here.
[03:51:32.000 --> 03:51:34.000]  And take it completely out of context.
[03:51:34.000 --> 03:51:37.000]  They do it all the time.
[03:51:37.000 --> 03:51:39.000]  That's how they manipulate the system.
[03:51:39.000 --> 03:51:42.000]  That's how they have black people today believing that reparations
[03:51:42.000 --> 03:51:44.000]  is going to help you.
[03:51:44.000 --> 03:51:46.000]  And see, a lot of black people don't even understand the history
[03:51:46.000 --> 03:51:47.000]  reparation.
[03:51:47.000 --> 03:51:50.000]  Reparations was created by the Republican Party,
[03:51:50.000 --> 03:51:52.000]  which the Republican Party was against slavery.
[03:51:52.000 --> 03:51:55.000]  The Republican Party was helping black people armed themselves
[03:51:55.000 --> 03:51:57.000]  against the KKK Democrat Party.
[03:51:57.000 --> 03:51:59.000]  But a lot of people still don't realize that a lot of black people
[03:51:59.000 --> 03:52:01.000]  do not realize that.
[03:52:01.000 --> 03:52:04.000]  And why not?
[03:52:04.000 --> 03:52:06.000]  And why not?
[03:52:06.000 --> 03:52:10.000]  Seriously?
[03:52:10.000 --> 03:52:14.000]  The Democrats have done nothing to improve the community
[03:52:14.000 --> 03:52:17.000]  of the black people.
[03:52:17.000 --> 03:52:20.000]  And they have done anything to improve the community of Latinos.
[03:52:20.000 --> 03:52:22.000]  Think about it.
[03:52:22.000 --> 03:52:24.000]  They keep making these empty promises,
[03:52:24.000 --> 03:52:26.000]  but they yet they do nothing.
[03:52:26.000 --> 03:52:30.000]  And you know what's really clear indication about all of it?
[03:52:30.000 --> 03:52:33.000]  You have Joe Biden.
[03:52:33.000 --> 03:52:35.000]  You had Hillary Clinton.
[03:52:35.000 --> 03:52:37.000]  And now you have AOC.
[03:52:37.000 --> 03:52:40.000]  When they stand before black people,
[03:52:40.000 --> 03:52:43.000]  all of a sudden, y'all, we got to talk like this.
[03:52:43.000 --> 03:52:46.000]  Because down here, y'all, black people don't understand anything
[03:52:46.000 --> 03:52:49.000]  else unless I talk like this, y'all.
[03:52:49.000 --> 03:52:51.000]  This it, y'all.
[03:52:51.000 --> 03:52:55.000]  Y'all, black people have been oppressed for years.
[03:52:55.000 --> 03:52:58.000]  See, y'all, this is how it is.
[03:52:58.000 --> 03:53:01.000]  AOC, because I'm here to talk to you black people,
[03:53:01.000 --> 03:53:03.000]  because black people don't understand nothing
[03:53:03.000 --> 03:53:06.000]  unless I talk like this to you black people.
[03:53:06.000 --> 03:53:09.000]  Why do black people keep following for this nonsense?
[03:53:09.000 --> 03:53:11.000]  I don't understand it.
[03:53:11.000 --> 03:53:15.000]  AOC, Hillary Clinton,
[03:53:15.000 --> 03:53:19.000]  Joe Biden, there's been multiple clips with them doing it.
[03:53:19.000 --> 03:53:22.000]  As if black people don't understand what you're saying.
[03:53:22.000 --> 03:53:25.000]  You don't understand where it's coming out of my mouth
[03:53:25.000 --> 03:53:28.000]  unless I'm talking like I'm all country
[03:53:28.000 --> 03:53:32.000]  and y'all don't understand them because y'all from the stitch.
[03:53:32.000 --> 03:53:35.000]  That don't make any sense to me.
[03:53:35.000 --> 03:53:37.000]  And for some reason, they fix it in their head
[03:53:37.000 --> 03:53:40.000]  that that's how they're supposed to talk to black people.
[03:53:40.000 --> 03:53:44.000]  And what's really remarkable is the black people sitting in the audience,
[03:53:44.000 --> 03:53:47.000]  sitting there taking that.
[03:53:47.000 --> 03:53:50.000]  Knowing good and well, they don't talk that way.
[03:53:50.000 --> 03:53:52.000]  Why would they sit there?
[03:53:52.000 --> 03:53:55.000]  Someone in the audience when AOC was up there talking,
[03:53:55.000 --> 03:53:58.000]  someone in the audience and said, why are you talking that way?
[03:53:58.000 --> 03:54:02.000]  Why are you talking that way?
[03:54:02.000 --> 03:54:04.000]  They don't do that though.
[03:54:04.000 --> 03:54:06.000]  They just start clapping.
[03:54:06.000 --> 03:54:10.000]  Black people, for some reason, they keep going right along with it.
[03:54:10.000 --> 03:54:11.000]  Right along with it.
[03:54:11.000 --> 03:54:13.000]  And then they come up and they say, oh, you're going to get this.
[03:54:13.000 --> 03:54:14.000]  You're going to get this.
[03:54:14.000 --> 03:54:17.000]  We're going to give you that and give you that and get nothing.
[03:54:17.000 --> 03:54:21.000]  But more heartache, more poverty, less jobs.
[03:54:21.000 --> 03:54:23.000]  But oh, here come President Trump.
[03:54:23.000 --> 03:54:26.000]  Look at the jobs in the black community.
[03:54:26.000 --> 03:54:29.000]  Look at the jobs in the black community.
[03:54:29.000 --> 03:54:32.000]  See that changed all of it, right?
[03:54:32.000 --> 03:54:34.000]  And then they try to give the credit to Obama.
[03:54:34.000 --> 03:54:39.000]  Really, really, they don't want to give the credit to President Trump
[03:54:39.000 --> 03:54:43.000]  because then more black people will recognize what President Trump is doing.
[03:54:43.000 --> 03:54:46.000]  So like I was saying, I'm going to play this clip.
[03:54:46.000 --> 03:54:47.000]  It was a report I did.
[03:54:47.000 --> 03:54:51.000]  It's on infowars.com for its last show.
[03:54:51.000 --> 03:54:59.000]  Actually, if you go to the infowars.com and go to the media section,
[03:54:59.000 --> 03:55:02.000]  you can see this report in its full content.
[03:55:02.000 --> 03:55:04.000]  I'm just going to play some of it.
[03:55:04.000 --> 03:55:09.000]  The point is that they have the black people, the youth,
[03:55:09.000 --> 03:55:12.000]  dumbed down to believe the stuff that they're saying.
[03:55:12.000 --> 03:55:15.000]  And it is just unbelievable.
[03:55:15.000 --> 03:55:17.000]  Okay, so let me go ahead and pull this up.
[03:55:17.000 --> 03:55:18.000]  I already got it queued.
[03:55:18.000 --> 03:55:20.000]  We're going to go ahead and roll with it.
[03:55:20.000 --> 03:55:21.000]  All right.
[03:55:21.000 --> 03:55:22.000]  That's okay.
[03:55:22.000 --> 03:55:23.000]  Okay, wait a minute.
[03:55:23.000 --> 03:55:24.000]  You're walking by.
[03:55:24.000 --> 03:55:29.000]  It's obviously you were addressing your question or your statement towards me.
[03:55:29.000 --> 03:55:31.000]  Because I'm standing here with them.
[03:55:31.000 --> 03:55:32.000]  Directly towards you.
[03:55:32.000 --> 03:55:34.000]  I wasn't even towards them because they go out of account.
[03:55:34.000 --> 03:55:35.000]  Wait a minute.
[03:55:35.000 --> 03:55:36.000]  But it is.
[03:55:36.000 --> 03:55:37.000]  But it is.
[03:55:37.000 --> 03:55:38.000]  Hang on.
[03:55:38.000 --> 03:55:39.000]  Hang on.
[03:55:39.000 --> 03:55:40.000]  But you're assuming.
[03:55:40.000 --> 03:55:41.000]  Hang on.
[03:55:41.000 --> 03:55:42.000]  Let us finish.
[03:55:42.000 --> 03:55:43.000]  Let us finish.
[03:55:43.000 --> 03:55:44.000]  Trump is racist.
[03:55:44.000 --> 03:55:45.000]  Why?
[03:55:45.000 --> 03:55:46.000]  Why?
[03:55:46.000 --> 03:55:47.000]  Why is he racist?
[03:55:47.000 --> 03:55:50.000]  Because you guys want to blame all the Mexicans.
[03:55:50.000 --> 03:55:51.000]  Come here.
[03:55:51.000 --> 03:55:52.000]  Come here.
[03:55:52.000 --> 03:55:53.000]  Angie.
[03:55:53.000 --> 03:55:54.000]  Angie.
[03:55:54.000 --> 03:55:55.000]  Come here.
[03:55:55.000 --> 03:55:56.000]  And you want them to listen.
[03:55:56.000 --> 03:55:57.000]  Hang on.
[03:55:57.000 --> 03:55:58.000]  Listen.
[03:55:58.000 --> 03:55:59.000]  Listen.
[03:55:59.000 --> 03:56:01.000]  This is your son.
[03:56:01.000 --> 03:56:04.000]  Yeah, so see, that's it.
[03:56:04.000 --> 03:56:06.000]  Trump is racist.
[03:56:06.000 --> 03:56:07.000]  Why is he racist?
[03:56:07.000 --> 03:56:10.000]  If you want to see the full clip, go to infowars.com.
[03:56:10.000 --> 03:56:13.000]  And you can see the entire clip there.
[03:56:13.000 --> 03:56:14.000]  It's amazing.
[03:56:14.000 --> 03:56:18.000]  I actually put factual information in there so no one can dispute it.
[03:56:18.000 --> 03:56:24.000]  We also talked about how he tried to say Caucasians brought slaves here, black people.
[03:56:24.000 --> 03:56:27.000]  Caucasians have been doing stuff to black people.
[03:56:27.000 --> 03:56:34.000]  And I completely showed all the facts on it exactly what happened.
[03:56:34.000 --> 03:56:36.000]  They are not going to stop.
[03:56:36.000 --> 03:56:39.000]  The love is not going to stop.
[03:56:39.000 --> 03:56:44.000]  They have got to do everything they can to get rid of President Trump.
[03:56:44.000 --> 03:56:46.000]  And they're attacking white people.
[03:56:46.000 --> 03:56:51.000]  And one of the things I've said before, one of the things is that back in the 50s and
[03:56:51.000 --> 03:56:59.000]  the 60s, the way the Democrats used to do black people, the year 2019, 2020, they are
[03:56:59.000 --> 03:57:02.000]  going to want to do it to white people.
[03:57:02.000 --> 03:57:05.000]  It's here.
[03:57:05.000 --> 03:57:06.000]  It's here.
[03:57:06.000 --> 03:57:10.000]  The reason why I keep talking about it is because the same reason why Martin Luther King used
[03:57:10.000 --> 03:57:14.000]  to keep talking about it, because we've got to talk about it until they stop.
[03:57:14.000 --> 03:57:18.000]  And if they don't stop, then I'm not going to stop.
[03:57:18.000 --> 03:57:21.000]  We have to keep talking about it.
[03:57:21.000 --> 03:57:23.000]  My name is Will Johnson.
[03:57:23.000 --> 03:57:25.000]  This is the Alex Jones show.
[03:57:25.000 --> 03:57:29.000]  Next is Infowars with Owen Shorter.
[03:57:29.000 --> 03:57:31.000]  That's the war room.
[03:57:31.000 --> 03:57:34.000]  The war room with Owen Shorter.
[03:57:34.000 --> 03:57:35.000]  Thank you for watching.
[03:57:35.000 --> 03:57:36.000]  Thank you for watching.
[03:57:36.000 --> 03:57:37.000]  God bless.
[03:57:37.000 --> 03:57:38.000]  God bless.
[03:57:38.000 --> 03:57:39.000]  God bless.
[03:57:39.000 --> 03:57:40.000]  God bless.
[03:57:40.000 --> 03:57:41.000]  God bless.
[03:57:41.000 --> 03:57:42.000]  God bless.
[03:57:42.000 --> 03:58:11.000]  God bless.
[03:58:11.000 --> 03:58:12.000]  God bless.
[03:58:41.000 --> 03:58:43.000]  We'll be right back.
[03:58:43.000 --> 03:59:12.000]  We'll be right back.
[03:59:13.000 --> 03:59:42.000]  We'll be right back.
[03:59:43.000 --> 03:59:44.000]  We'll be right back.
