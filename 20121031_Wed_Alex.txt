[01:23.560 --> 01:29.080]  shooting people we had barely even covered it yesterday because we kind of
[01:29.080 --> 01:33.840]  ignore the dinosaur media but the new Atlantic and some of the other
[01:33.840 --> 01:40.360]  establishment liberal sites like the Daily Beast they came out and said that
[01:40.360 --> 01:45.480]  Matt Drudge of drudgereport.com info wars.com in our article was basically
[01:45.480 --> 01:49.640]  evil pointing out that there were people saying that they would loot and said
[01:49.640 --> 01:55.000]  those were jokes really people said they would loot in the very towns and cities
[01:55.000 --> 01:58.960]  like Coney Island it's now been looted up one side and down the other in fact I
[01:58.960 --> 02:03.160]  think you guys a newscast out of New York that we're gonna be playing some
[02:03.160 --> 02:08.840]  clips of we do have that where it just shows banks robbed houses homes TV shops

[02:13.760 --> 02:19.960]  the burglar bars but it doesn't exist because the mainstream media said so I
[02:19.960 --> 02:24.240]  mean actually it is in hundreds of newspapers that five states have looting
[02:24.240 --> 02:30.000]  up and down them Rhode Island has it New Jersey New York Pennsylvania the list
[02:30.000 --> 02:35.840]  goes on and on and the looting is to now intensify and shameless looters
[02:35.840 --> 02:43.480]  display stolen goods on Twitter Sandy loot crew plans more heist and violence
[02:43.480 --> 02:57.360]  tonight now we are going to also get into the latest on the entire scandal with
[02:57.360 --> 03:01.720]  the White House caught lying when they said that they didn't deny aid to the
[03:01.720 --> 03:06.920]  ambassador I am still not exactly sure what happened in Benghazi I know it's
[03:06.920 --> 03:11.920]  become a political football but I do know this anything about Al Qaeda anything
[03:11.920 --> 03:18.080]  about bin Laden period is being deleted off Facebook and they've told us they'll
[03:18.080 --> 03:20.880]  shut down one of our big Facebooks we wrote about that yesterday and showed
[03:20.880 --> 03:27.040]  you their notice now the big Navy SEAL group that's running mild TV ads about
[03:27.040 --> 03:32.400]  Obama shouldn't politicize the Navy SEALs they are now having their post
[03:32.400 --> 03:37.840]  deleted here's one of them from Breitbart up at info wars.com as well not
[03:37.840 --> 03:42.240]  as Breitbart.com Obama called the SEALs and they got bin Laden when the SEALs
[03:42.240 --> 03:47.240]  called Obama they got denied that meme image you know you put out images you
[03:47.240 --> 03:52.720]  put out cartoons things like that's what we do on Facebook and our bin Laden
[03:52.720 --> 03:57.440]  saying Al CIA to it was shared over a hundred thousand times and they deleted
[03:57.440 --> 04:01.480]  that and the Navy SEALs put this up with bin Laden and so you can clearly see
[04:01.480 --> 04:06.920]  that they've got an AI software doing this or hamfisted moderators that they
[04:06.920 --> 04:11.320]  see anything about bin Ghazi anything about bin Laden it is deleted and the
[04:11.320 --> 04:17.720]  SEALs got the same note and were told that they would be deleted they would
[04:17.720 --> 04:21.320]  lose their account if they dare engage in political activity last year Darren
[04:21.320 --> 04:25.880]  McBreen we did an article on this his little Facebook page with political
[04:25.880 --> 04:31.600]  stuff had mild things criticizing the government and they said look that's not
[04:31.600 --> 04:35.880]  allowed you will be deleted if you do that so let's just get it straight when
[04:35.880 --> 04:40.240]  you criticize China and places of censorship or Russia it's almost worse
[04:40.240 --> 04:43.640]  here I mean what's next being sent to a reeducation camp well they actually have
[04:43.640 --> 04:47.800]  that mean new army manuals also the mainstream media is trying to blame me

[07:08.080 --> 07:11.640]  to healthy homecrafted sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut yogurt
[07:11.640 --> 07:15.360]  and kefir it seems there's a war on life-giving foods with living enzymes and
[07:15.360 --> 07:18.920]  healthy bacteria but frankly I'm not sure what the food police are so afraid of
[07:18.920 --> 07:22.040]  these remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history with
[07:22.040 --> 07:25.240]  archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found across
[07:25.240 --> 07:28.840]  the globe in almost every culture even today Japanese eat miso
[07:28.840 --> 07:33.200]  Africans eat fermented porches Koreans eat kamichi and in India fermented milk

[08:14.520 --> 08:20.280]  we are live ladies and gentlemen transmitting worldwide blasting out on
[08:20.280 --> 08:26.720]  the M&FM dial global shortwave XM satellite 166 and streaming audio and
[08:26.720 --> 08:36.040]  video at prisonplanet.tv infowars.com and prisonplanet.com okay coming up
[08:36.040 --> 08:40.080]  for about 30 minutes in studio in the third hour we've got Wade Hicks the
[08:40.080 --> 08:43.640]  defense contractor with a high-level security clearance no criminal record
[08:43.640 --> 08:50.920]  who is not allowed to fly because he's a prepper they saw on his website they saw
[08:50.920 --> 08:54.120]  him online they said you're not allowed to be a prepper that means you're
[08:54.120 --> 08:59.280]  terrorist basically and they stranded him for six days in Hawaii now we broke
[08:59.280 --> 09:04.480]  that news via the Northeast Intelligence Network and then it hit the
[09:04.480 --> 09:09.160]  associated present things he's gonna be here in Austin today so he's scheduled
[09:09.160 --> 09:14.520]  in studio now that aside obviously we've got the incredible aftermath of the
[09:14.520 --> 09:20.200]  storm it was somewhat hyped but still pretty darn devastating in many areas so
[09:20.200 --> 09:25.080]  not the mega hype we were hoping for because I would rather it be hype than
[09:25.080 --> 09:29.680]  you know really be as devastating as they were talking about Al Gore says don't
[09:29.680 --> 09:34.640]  worry if you just pay him and Obama and the Rothschilds and Rockefellers to
[09:34.640 --> 09:38.040]  their private carbon exchange like they're now doing in England they're
[09:38.040 --> 09:41.880]  now charging people more for their power and giving it to private banks as a
[09:41.880 --> 09:47.200]  indulgence as a way to get you out of environmental purgatory back in
[09:47.200 --> 09:53.800]  Deval Halla and so they are they are now saying that if you pay Al Gore money he
[09:53.800 --> 09:57.440]  will wave a magic wand and no more bad storms will ever hit us because you know
[09:57.440 --> 10:02.080]  in any type of weather it's climate change now the seasons are abnormal and
[10:02.080 --> 10:05.080]  all the polar bears are dying even though their numbers are up five full
[10:05.080 --> 10:08.600]  since the 1950s you can look that up for yourself they just tell kids they can't
[10:08.600 --> 10:12.760]  swim you know they're the best land animal when it comes to swimming but
[10:12.760 --> 10:18.040]  that's a side issue and we have other articles like this US Supreme Court to
[10:18.040 --> 10:24.760]  argue use of canine search outside your home this is a Donna Anderson breaking
[10:24.760 --> 10:29.280]  an info wars.com they're already allowed to search your car your crotch in your
[10:29.280 --> 10:33.720]  luggage without a warrant now man's best friend is about to be allowed to sniff
[10:33.720 --> 10:37.920]  around outside your home too now I've actually been walking around in New
[10:37.920 --> 10:41.320]  York and had cops come over with a German Shepherd and run it up between my
[10:41.320 --> 10:46.200]  legs that's the freedom of America to stop the drugs the government ships in
[10:46.200 --> 10:50.360]  and if they smell something they don't like you're going to jail the
[10:50.360 --> 10:53.920]  constitutional right to be secure in your home papers person in effects it's
[10:53.920 --> 10:57.520]  over against unreasonable search and seizure is about to be erased at your
[10:57.520 --> 11:02.720]  house as well Gregory Gare an attorney representing the state of Florida argues
[11:02.720 --> 11:06.240]  that it's perfectly legal to use drug detection dogs to sniff around your
[11:06.240 --> 11:12.080]  outside house if the dog alerts that they can use that to justify entering
[11:12.080 --> 11:16.960]  your home to conduct a search no warrant needed of course the many of these dogs
[11:16.960 --> 11:19.960]  have been trained to alert on anything so they get a biscuit he compares it to
[11:19.960 --> 11:25.120]  trick or treaters on Halloween night so yeah I mean you've seen Boston in New
[11:25.120 --> 11:28.240]  York the knock-and-talk or they come and knock and say we're gonna come in look
[11:28.240 --> 11:32.080]  for guns no judge no jury no probable cause we just want to see your guns
[11:32.080 --> 11:36.760]  Dallas is now doing it of all places look it up and it's just pure
[11:36.760 --> 11:39.360]  intimidation they're erasing the fourth amendment they're racing everything
[11:39.360 --> 11:42.520]  that's what the TSA is about is breaking your will hey we grabbed your
[11:42.520 --> 11:46.360]  genitals already we take you to private rooms and rip your colostomy bags off and
[11:46.360 --> 11:53.000]  strip all ladies shut out and shut up the police did the same thing that
[11:53.000 --> 11:55.600]  millions of Americans will do this is what he argues in court or in Halloween
[11:55.600 --> 11:59.920]  night which is walk up to the front steps knock on the door and while they're
[11:59.920 --> 12:03.640]  there they took in the air and the dog alerted to the smell of illegal
[12:03.640 --> 12:08.520]  narcotics so we're just gonna randomly come up no judge no jury no probable
[12:08.520 --> 12:11.920]  cause not even a fake informant and we're just gonna come and then if we
[12:11.920 --> 12:16.560]  smell something we're coming in TSA's got to search your bags they got to
[12:16.560 --> 12:20.640]  search your pants why don't have the police to search your house the
[12:20.640 --> 12:23.320]  difference is Americans don't have to open their door to trick or treaters if
[12:23.320 --> 12:26.480]  they don't want to but we all know what happens if you deny entry to a cop here
[12:26.480 --> 12:31.760]  comes a swatting issue is the 2006 case involving and it goes over the whole
[12:31.760 --> 12:34.880]  deal I'm gonna cover that more later now again that's not really our top news
[12:34.880 --> 12:39.400]  here neither is this I'm getting to our top news in a minute but this is pretty
[12:39.400 --> 12:45.800]  darn important the National Institute of Health just last Friday published big
[12:45.800 --> 12:51.840]  university study hundreds of pages long going over what's been backed up by
[12:51.840 --> 12:56.960]  other studies that as pertain actually makes rats being fed the same other
[12:56.960 --> 13:02.640]  diet but being fed sugar in the diet makes them fatter and shuts off their
[13:02.640 --> 13:08.720]  pancreas well what do we have here by natural news comm up at info wars comm
[13:08.720 --> 13:11.920]  with big links to the new study I'll get into the study and give you all the
[13:11.920 --> 13:15.680]  details later if we get to top news you can read it for yourself though in full
[13:15.680 --> 13:25.080]  detail at info wars comm linking through to the NCBI and that's the National
[13:25.080 --> 13:29.800]  Institute of Health as well that as pertain is linked to leukemia and
[13:29.800 --> 13:34.640]  lymphoma in new landmark study on humans wow we're getting these every every
[13:34.640 --> 13:38.560]  few days now National Institutes of Health in the 70s they tried to get it
[13:38.560 --> 13:42.880]  approved three times and couldn't suraldead but when they got bought by
[13:42.880 --> 13:47.040]  Monsanto they had the muscle in government to get it approved it was
[13:47.040 --> 13:51.160]  they had a Monsanto at the time you guessed it mr. WMD in Iraq himself
[13:51.160 --> 13:55.600]  mr. give nuclear reactors in North Korea I mean he's almost like the devil like a
[13:55.600 --> 13:58.840]  poof of black smoke appears when something evil is going on and it's
[13:58.840 --> 14:07.000]  Donald Rumsfeld just amazing they finally got it approved in 1981 folks in
[14:07.000 --> 14:12.000]  all the Reese's monkey studies you guessed it massive tumors if they gave
[14:12.000 --> 14:17.000]  it to babies and mothers milk it killed them baby monkeys but still got it
[14:17.000 --> 14:23.280]  approved and there that is thought you might want to you know know that when
[14:23.280 --> 14:30.640]  you go to the grocery store to the candy aisle every sugared candy gum every one
[14:30.640 --> 14:35.560]  of them has it unless you order online beamons or something you know Chuck
[14:35.560 --> 14:39.880]  Geiger's favorite brand of gum in my two the point is there's a you can order
[14:39.880 --> 14:47.320]  non-aspartame gum online you can find it in specialty shops or at places like
[14:47.320 --> 14:52.360]  Whole Foods you know they're bringing an aspartame gum now but you cannot find it
[14:52.360 --> 14:57.720]  at major stores and if you ask for it they laugh at you of course voting with
[14:57.720 --> 15:01.160]  your dollars you should demand they bring in gum that doesn't have it how
[15:01.160 --> 15:04.680]  about old-fashioned sugar you know people been voting with their dollars in the
[15:04.680 --> 15:09.560]  last decade or so well the Mexicans here in Texas would not drink the horrible

[15:29.840 --> 15:34.360]  that causes obesity and pancreatic cancer and so many other things in big
[15:34.360 --> 15:37.560]  studies and also has heavy metals in it for whatever reason because of the
[15:37.560 --> 15:42.680]  extraction process looking up yourself you because people voted with their
[15:42.680 --> 15:50.600]  dollars you can buy real sugar coke and buy real sugar Pepsi but you can get

[24:50.040 --> 24:53.840]  they're finding more bodies so it is a big tragedy but I wouldn't call it the
[24:53.840 --> 24:56.760]  worst storm ever I wouldn't even call Katrina that I mean they've had
[24:56.760 --> 24:59.600]  hurricanes that destroyed all of Galveston and killed tens of thousands
[24:59.600 --> 25:04.800]  before so we're gonna be breaking all of that down imagine the old days they
[25:04.800 --> 25:08.320]  wouldn't know a hurricane was coming it would just come slam in and you know
[25:08.320 --> 25:13.040]  cover entire coastal areas but continuing here we're gonna be getting to
[25:13.040 --> 25:17.960]  that in a moment after the break I'm gonna cover this yesterday Melissa
[25:17.960 --> 25:24.680]  Melton linked to a Washington Post article from 2009 linked to the
[25:24.680 --> 25:29.160]  Department of Homeland Security site Obama ordered DHS to control
[25:29.160 --> 25:33.560]  hurricanes and we link to it weather modifications steering and controlling
[25:33.560 --> 25:36.400]  of hurricanes that we know the Pentagon has been able to control since the
[25:36.400 --> 25:43.200]  Stanford Research Institute certified it in 1967 well guess what they attack
[25:43.200 --> 25:52.520]  Kurt Nemo in USA today Salon you name it saying we basically made it up that
[25:52.520 --> 25:56.360]  that there's any type of weather modification kind of like the Atlantic
[25:56.360 --> 26:04.840]  magazine and Daily Beast two days ago said we were insane and on Monday and
[26:04.840 --> 26:08.000]  that there would be no looting and they actually said in the Atlantic it's a
[26:08.000 --> 26:13.320]  myth that there's looting after hurricanes really there's there's looting
[26:13.320 --> 26:17.720]  all over the world after disasters except I guess in Japan because they're
[26:17.720 --> 26:26.120]  so so I guess you'd call it civilized so honorable but the point is is that
[26:26.120 --> 26:30.360]  wherever there's disarmed populations wherever there's welfare classes you're
[26:30.360 --> 26:35.680]  gonna see this type of thing but no no no there there's no looting and and and
[26:35.680 --> 26:39.160]  of course there's been a bunch of looting now
[26:44.560 --> 26:51.320]  okay ladies and gentlemen we're gonna be covering that again coming up later in

[33:59.160 --> 34:05.160]  criminals and it's a lot worse than just Barack H. Obama when you go read the
[34:05.160 --> 34:09.360]  tweets we've got at info wars.com and prison planet.com if you just joined us
[34:09.360 --> 34:14.880]  I'm Alex Jones your host they are saying yeah that they're using boats now to go
[34:14.880 --> 34:21.040]  around looting and robbing and the other police are just standing around while
[34:21.040 --> 34:24.520]  all of this goes on and I'm noticing it's worse in New York City in places
[34:24.520 --> 34:30.560]  where the public is disarmed that's where you have more of the home invasions
[34:30.560 --> 34:38.320]  all of it because the people have been conditioned to just lay down and take it
[34:38.320 --> 34:44.520]  amazing I wonder if we'll get apologies from the Daily Beast I wonder if we'll
[34:44.520 --> 34:52.960]  get apologies from the Atlantic Magazine a new Atlantic for saying Monday that
[34:52.960 --> 34:56.720]  we were making it up that there were people saying they were gonna loot now
[34:56.720 --> 35:02.680]  I don't I don't think we should be holding holding our breath for that to
[35:02.680 --> 35:08.760]  happen okay let me now shift gears we'll get more into that subject in a moment to
[35:08.760 --> 35:14.480]  info wars.com in the news we don't a lot of times talk about when we're in the
[35:14.480 --> 35:21.280]  news we're in the news every day now pretty much and most of time it's even
[35:21.280 --> 35:26.080]  mainstream media following our lead and basically copying or rewriting our
[35:26.080 --> 35:31.640]  stories because you know we cover a lot of things that are pretty hot issues
[35:31.640 --> 35:35.680]  that's how we get copied every day which is fine that's that's that's a sign of
[35:35.680 --> 35:41.080]  success but these two groups of articles I've got to cover our demonization
[35:41.080 --> 35:46.000]  programs against us and again we'll get a document cam shot of this for for
[35:46.000 --> 35:52.880]  viewers radio listeners can just search engine these terms conspiracy theorists
[35:52.880 --> 36:01.040]  say Obama engineered hurricane Sandy now again what is the word conspiracy
[36:01.040 --> 36:07.960]  theorist it's a pejorative kind of like racist or crazy or whatever and when
[36:07.960 --> 36:11.040]  you have governments that have certified they can control hurricanes when you've
[36:11.040 --> 36:14.400]  got a very unusual storm hitting right before an election that if it was a
[36:14.400 --> 36:17.400]  little bit stronger could have postponed the election there's still some talk
[36:17.400 --> 36:21.720]  about that and it acts very strange and we have meteorologists on that say it's
[36:21.720 --> 36:25.360]  acting strange and we know there's government programs to do this we'd
[36:25.360 --> 36:30.920]  be crazy not to point it out well they go on to attack us and say on Friday in
[36:30.920 --> 36:36.160]  full wars yeah never say.com USA Today never give us any credits of folks can
[36:36.160 --> 36:41.200]  actually go read our full article in context a story arguing that Sandy quote
[36:41.200 --> 36:46.200]  will undoubtedly produce widespread chaos and present an ideal opportunity for
[36:46.200 --> 36:49.880]  Obama to come off as a strong and decisive leader which he's out there
[36:49.880 --> 36:54.000]  during FEMA announcements on TV making making political statements I have those
[36:54.000 --> 37:02.160]  articles here today so we I mean that happened he's grandstanding following the
[37:02.160 --> 37:06.360]  perfect storm wrote in full wars Kurt Nemo the establishment media will naturally
[37:06.360 --> 37:10.080]  provide all the propaganda Obama needs to sweep the election on Tuesday number
[37:10.080 --> 37:16.120]  six and week after the hurricane is projected to hit so that's the reports
[37:16.120 --> 37:23.280]  we've got right there. As proof Nemo notes harp status.com so they do
[37:23.280 --> 37:26.400]  give a link to that and tell you the site because they want to discredit it. A site
[37:26.400 --> 37:30.840]  that claims to detect frequency on the ionosphere is reporting unprecedented
[37:30.840 --> 37:34.200]  levels of harp frequency I've had the director of harp on admitting it can
[37:34.200 --> 37:38.960]  manipulate weather I've got Daily Mail AP Reuters BBC admitting these antenna
[37:38.960 --> 37:43.960]  arrays do manipulate jet streams you can take one from 30,000 feet down to ground
[37:43.960 --> 37:47.400]  level and flood everybody out in the 60s they were flooding the Ho Chi Minh
[37:47.400 --> 37:52.000]  Trail every day with just a few dozen aircraft spraying but they act like it
[37:52.000 --> 37:55.320]  doesn't exist it's like when they have an urban warfare drill I'll cover it the
[37:55.320 --> 37:58.520]  news will say Jones claimed there was a drill but here was the drill and the
[37:58.520 --> 38:02.000]  colonel said it wasn't a big deal I claimed there was a drill but it existed
[38:02.000 --> 38:08.040]  but I'm bad to talk about it. As proof Nemo points to the site it said that
[38:08.040 --> 38:11.780]  claims to detect frequency on the ionosphere is reporting unprecedented
[38:11.780 --> 38:19.360]  levels of harp. It goes the harp status site appears to be a site not
[38:19.360 --> 38:24.000]  actually associated with harp yeah it's a group saying they track it in a piece
[38:24.000 --> 38:32.080]  of non-profit website Skeptics.com 2010 aerospace and computer engineer David
[38:32.080 --> 38:35.920]  something or another explained why he believes conspiracy theorists love to
[38:35.920 --> 38:39.840]  blame harp let me see I had Dr. Begich on yesterday breaking down harp he lives
[38:39.840 --> 38:43.880]  up in Alaska folks I can have been lit it from the father or weather weapons on
[38:43.880 --> 38:47.640]  and they just sit there and go oh this is an unscientific site but our
[38:47.640 --> 38:53.120]  scientist says it you know he doesn't really exist so it's that appeal to
[38:53.120 --> 38:57.760]  authority so let me I'm not even gonna get into what Salon's saying I'm not
[38:57.760 --> 39:01.080]  even gonna get into that I'm gonna show you Melissa Melton's article Obama
[39:01.080 --> 39:06.040]  ordered DHS to control hurricanes and in it we have a link to the Washington
[39:06.040 --> 39:12.560]  Post in 2009 where Obama ordered DHS and we'll show the document on screen from
[39:12.560 --> 39:18.280]  the Washington Post to begin going in and testing manipulation of hurricanes
[39:18.280 --> 39:25.360]  in the Atlantic now to DHS's credit they said while QAR recognizes that
[39:25.360 --> 39:29.200]  weather modification in general is occurring through the funding of
[39:29.200 --> 39:33.160]  private enterprises NOAA does not support research that entails efforts to
[39:33.160 --> 39:36.640]  modify hurricanes NOAA and its predecessor agency yeah they decided
[39:36.640 --> 39:43.360]  this in 16-7 once supported and conducted research in the hurricane
[39:43.360 --> 39:49.600]  modifications or project storm fury who we have the director of doctor
[39:49.600 --> 39:57.920]  physicist meteorologist world war two in Vietnam and Korea vet amazing guy he
[39:57.920 --> 40:04.520]  headed up storm fury 1962 to 1983 now show on the URL on that document but
[40:04.520 --> 40:09.680]  let's back out of it the URL on that is the Washington Post yesterday we had it
[40:09.680 --> 40:14.840]  where you could see it but but but again just punch it up on my computer over
[40:14.840 --> 40:21.800]  here when we can show me URL that's Washington Post media okay here yeah
[40:21.800 --> 40:26.320]  we'll just go ahead and click on it so they can see up there in the URL you guys
[40:26.320 --> 40:28.720]  can take control of my computer if you want to show them the point is I want to
[40:28.720 --> 40:33.560]  show everybody out there watching radio listeners and go check this that that you
[40:33.560 --> 40:41.560]  can go to the site and you can see there it is washingtonpost.com washington
[40:41.560 --> 40:48.480]  post.com calm oh but USA today says we talked to a scientist that said
[40:48.480 --> 40:52.520]  conspiracy theorists love to believe in weather modification and harm but it
[40:52.520 --> 40:59.000]  just doesn't exist they blah blah blah blah blah Obama ordered them and they
[40:59.000 --> 41:03.520]  said we don't want to do that we did the studies and in those studies they
[41:03.520 --> 41:08.760]  they certified five years into the study 62 and started 67 they certified they
[41:08.760 --> 41:13.700]  could create hurricanes kill hurricanes weaken hurricanes strengthen
[41:13.700 --> 41:21.800]  hurricanes steer hurricanes okay and that's the bottom line so we're saying
[41:21.800 --> 41:27.560]  man this is an unusual storm nobody denied that frankenstorm if they can
[41:27.560 --> 41:32.120]  really soup it up enough if they are staging it they can use this to suspend
[41:32.120 --> 41:34.880]  the election and then now there's been discussion of suspending it thank God
[41:34.880 --> 41:37.360]  it hasn't been bad enough to do it I mean I guess some people are gonna get to
[41:37.360 --> 41:43.000]  vote though meanwhile Romney is swinging ahead in all these major swing states I
[41:43.000 --> 41:45.760]  mean it looks like he's gonna win the electoral college and the popular vote
[41:45.760 --> 41:48.800]  unless the electronic voting machines kick in and I'm not excited about that
[41:48.800 --> 41:52.520]  we'll just have some new globalist puppet that'll be a distraction while the
[41:52.520 --> 41:55.320]  whole military industrial complex the foreign-making cartel that runs it
[41:55.320 --> 42:00.240]  continues its operations I mean you know I get to where I hate the last puppet I
[42:00.240 --> 42:03.280]  didn't like George Bush I don't like Obama I'm sure I'll get to where I hate
[42:03.280 --> 42:10.160]  Mitt Romney you know there's always this pathetic hope that you know that you
[42:10.160 --> 42:15.240]  know that he might be better but but the point is whether modifications real
[42:15.240 --> 42:19.920]  hurricane manipulations real can we put the wash in post I want you posted an
[42:19.920 --> 42:24.680]  article on it that you know White House I forget the exact headline pull it up
[42:24.680 --> 42:27.960]  you know White House wants to modify hurricanes you can pull that up Bill
[42:27.960 --> 42:33.360]  Gates is involved in ABC News not just USA Today not just wash and post on this
[42:33.360 --> 42:39.280]  subject the White House science are giving speeches on it but then we go
[42:39.280 --> 42:42.680]  hey you can control hurricanes were you involved you ordered them to start
[42:42.680 --> 42:47.160]  getting into it you know maybe you're involved oh you crazy people it doesn't
[42:47.160 --> 42:53.000]  exist what's he say here conspiracy theorist love it conspiracy theorists
[42:53.000 --> 43:01.360]  love it why does he say aerospace computer engineer David Nattich explained
[43:01.360 --> 43:05.640]  why he believes conspiracy theorists love to blame hard it's a gigantic high
[43:05.640 --> 43:09.800]  energy Pentagon funded gizmo located in remote Alaska wilderness that plays
[43:09.800 --> 43:14.120]  around with the Earth's atmosphere he wrote but whose purpose seems deeply
[43:14.120 --> 43:18.080]  mysterious and to the scientifically uninformed oh I've had the director of
[43:18.080 --> 43:21.040]  harp on and a colonel came on there in the break and killed the interview when
[43:21.040 --> 43:26.000]  the guy was like we we can set the atmosphere on fire some nights and I
[43:26.000 --> 43:31.640]  mean you know I've been involved in national TV show investigations with
[43:31.640 --> 43:36.520]  Jesse Ventura of harp he's been up there they've got harp arrays all over I
[43:36.520 --> 43:41.280]  can show you mainstream news where the Arabs in Saudi Arabia Dubai you name it
[43:41.280 --> 43:44.760]  are putting up their own arrays making it rain admitting it the Russians have
[43:44.760 --> 43:49.000]  had it for 30 years or longer but the communist Chinese have got it it's all
[43:49.000 --> 43:53.920]  over the news but when we say hey they might be doing that doesn't exist you
[43:53.920 --> 43:58.680]  scientifically uninformed really can we put the Washington Post back up with a
[43:58.680 --> 44:05.760]  letter from Noah via DHS Obama ordered DHS do it they went to Noah and said do
[44:05.760 --> 44:09.240]  it and they said well we did do it in Operation Storm Fury which found they
[44:09.240 --> 44:13.320]  can control them and create them that's Fox News AP Reuters go look up
[44:13.320 --> 44:18.840]  Operation Storm Fury hundreds of articles got declassified in 2006 we we
[44:18.840 --> 44:22.680]  immediately thought hey let's let's get the guy on who was the director he was
[44:22.680 --> 44:27.440]  sure enough still alive still kicking came on the show
[44:27.440 --> 44:32.440]  oh look kwtx committee approves bill establishing weather modification
[44:32.440 --> 44:38.960]  program 2005 the US Senate Commerce Committee voted Thursday to approve a
[44:38.960 --> 44:42.280]  bill by Texas Senator Kay Bully Hutchison establishing a weather
[44:42.280 --> 44:46.520]  modification program yeah we covered that at the time and he living still was
[44:46.520 --> 44:50.080]  talking to her at the time and then they reclassified it yeah they relaunched
[44:50.080 --> 44:55.960]  the program in the mid 90s Obama says go and do this that print me that please
[44:55.960 --> 45:01.120]  guys that's what I mean I have forgotten more than anybody would probably ever
[45:01.120 --> 45:04.880]  even know about this because all I do is study it's not that I'm smart I live
[45:04.880 --> 45:09.800]  this seven days a week I'm on the treadmill of news and research so much
[45:09.800 --> 45:13.320]  that you probably hear one percent of what I actually read every day here on
[45:13.320 --> 45:16.760]  here I get to like a you know ten percent of what I've got here I'm not
[45:16.760 --> 45:20.560]  bragging I'm saying I know about all this because I spent time looking into
[45:20.560 --> 45:26.640]  it I'm addicted I can't even stop looking I mean I'm already so sped up
[45:26.640 --> 45:31.800]  researching I can't stop thinking I I dream about work I dream about research
[45:31.800 --> 45:37.480]  I work while I sleep last night I had dream that's a dream of managing people
[45:37.480 --> 45:41.720]  in the office and in things people were magically listening to me we were
[45:41.720 --> 45:47.400]  magically getting more done meanwhile I see these throwaway lines by some guy
[45:47.400 --> 45:51.640]  at the skeptic site which which is the opposite of skeptics they say don't be
[45:51.640 --> 45:55.160]  skeptics of known liars that's what snopes and skeptics and all that does
[45:55.160 --> 45:58.800]  they just go I'm a scientist the conspiracy theorists don't know
[45:58.800 --> 46:03.720]  scientifically there's no other modification or doesn't do anything even
[46:03.720 --> 46:07.760]  other its own patents from Eastland corporation admit it you know I mean I
[46:07.760 --> 46:14.120]  had a scientist on your state listing patent numbers but what do they do they
[46:14.120 --> 46:21.920]  just go conspiracy theory they have throwaway lines to use against us so
[46:21.920 --> 46:28.080]  there's the proof there's the proof there's the proof of all of this going
[46:28.080 --> 46:32.160]  on there's massive weather modification two weeks ago they declassified the
[46:32.160 --> 46:39.600]  Kim trailing program one program in the U.S. is five billion dollars a year oh
[46:39.600 --> 46:44.120]  here's news 10 I remember this was all over the nose you can pull this up in
[46:44.120 --> 46:51.040]  hundreds of papers KWTX what is that out of Dallas I can't remember committee
[46:51.040 --> 46:55.680]  approves bill establishing weather modification program click here for the
[46:55.680 --> 47:02.360]  U.S. Senate website and a copy of the weather modification bureau oh but oh but
[47:02.360 --> 47:07.160]  they had a scared guy from skeptics look this site appears to not really be
[47:07.160 --> 47:10.840]  hard the site doesn't say it's hard saying they register energy increases but
[47:10.840 --> 47:17.080]  this is a good scientist he says none of it exists really really Washington post
[47:17.080 --> 47:22.480]  KWTX Senate dot gov I mean you know they're counting on you to be lazy and
[47:22.480 --> 47:26.000]  not go look now let's get to the really scary news I've got to cover right now
[47:26.000 --> 47:34.720]  to protect ourselves about five times in the last four years or so a drunk
[47:34.720 --> 47:39.040]  Marine his mom tries to throw him out of the house he shoots three cops that come
[47:39.040 --> 47:42.760]  to throw him out turns out he's a white supremacist on dozens of sites saying he
[47:42.760 --> 47:49.000]  hates me within two hours of being an arrest government connected media comes
[47:49.000 --> 47:53.240]  out and says that he killed people killed the cops for me trying to stick
[47:53.240 --> 47:59.000]  cops on me hoping they don't go check the facts five newspapers had to do
[47:59.000 --> 48:02.400]  retractions that the guy actually was a white supremacist who hated me and he
[48:02.400 --> 48:05.600]  did not he was not inspired to kill cops by Alex Jones because I say we don't
[48:05.600 --> 48:08.440]  want to start a war we don't want to have this happen and I'm not a white
[48:08.440 --> 48:13.000]  supremacist as it's known that's why he hated me well every time this happens
[48:13.000 --> 48:19.080]  guess what goes on within hours of arrest it's blamed on Alex Jones in
[48:19.080 --> 48:25.720]  newspaper after newspaper after newspaper newspaper links man arrested
[48:25.720 --> 48:32.200]  with explosives to Alex Jones a newspaper report posted on the San Mateo
[48:32.200 --> 48:36.560]  County Times also in the San Jose Mercury you name it website has linked Alex
[48:36.560 --> 48:40.080]  Jones to a man arrested with a hundred and forty five pounds of dynamite in his
[48:40.080 --> 48:45.480]  home authorities not public servants but authorities claim the man is linked to
[48:45.480 --> 48:48.760]  the sovereign citizen movement which they can call having a get out of the UN
[48:48.760 --> 48:52.720]  bumper sticker or killing people so that way they can demonize anybody by just
[48:52.720 --> 48:57.520]  using that you know the end of that term William Harrell 46 pled not guilty
[48:57.520 --> 49:02.280]  earlier this month to one felony count each of possessing explosives having
[49:02.280 --> 49:06.040]  marijuana for sale child endangerment and possible explosives near a resident
[49:06.040 --> 49:10.360]  he was arrested after police responded to a domestic argument with his girlfriend
[49:10.360 --> 49:13.800]  police discovered a hundred and forty five pounds of explosives never even know
[49:13.800 --> 49:17.200]  that's true folks I've seen them on the news with one of our listeners a guy
[49:17.200 --> 49:22.400]  know personally hold up jumper cables of his RV and go look pipe bombs pounds of
[49:22.400 --> 49:25.880]  explosives and thirty seven thousand dollars in cash in a closet of his home
[49:25.880 --> 49:32.520]  in Brisbane California according to Brisbane police commander Robert Meiser
[49:32.520 --> 49:35.720]  residents of the neighborhood were not evacuated because explosives did not
[49:35.720 --> 49:41.400]  pose a threat his girlfriend told investigators her boyfriend is a
[49:41.400 --> 49:45.000]  member of the sovereign citizen movement Harrell's father however said his son
[49:45.000 --> 49:48.480]  is not a member of the group there's even a group police have declined to
[49:48.480 --> 49:52.640]  directly associate him with any extremist groups but don't worry the San
[49:52.640 --> 49:56.200]  Jose Mercury news according to FBI people identified with the movement have
[49:56.200 --> 50:00.960]  killed six law enforcement officers not servants but officers since 2000 the

[56:17.480 --> 56:24.560]  to join us 800-259-9231 first-time callers let me add that caveat because we've got
[56:24.560 --> 56:27.760]  so many great listeners that love to get on who we love as well but you know we
[56:27.760 --> 56:31.320]  don't screen calls so then sometimes the same people get in so we screen them
[56:31.320 --> 56:37.040]  occasionally by saying hey first-time callers 800-259-9231 please give folks
[56:37.040 --> 56:40.720]  a chance to get on there I've never had a chance to get on here getting back to
[56:40.720 --> 56:44.640]  that issue let me be conservative the last time I did this was about a year ago
[56:44.640 --> 56:48.520]  I spent a couple hours going through our YouTube channels our affiliate
[56:48.520 --> 56:53.640]  channels supporter channels and it was 450 plus million views on YouTube that
[56:53.640 --> 56:58.200]  we've gotten in the last few years I haven't even done the math I mean it's
[56:58.200 --> 57:02.600]  probably 500 something million right now that's just YouTube we're on over a
[57:02.600 --> 57:06.520]  hundred AM and FM stations some of them in big cities like Chicago Dallas Texas
[57:06.520 --> 57:12.800]  you know you name it Tampa Florida station in between San Diego and LA
[57:12.800 --> 57:17.280]  covering five million people I mean we're on a lot of stations I can most
[57:17.280 --> 57:21.480]  most stations brag whenever you know they've got a million people in a
[57:21.480 --> 57:24.880]  listening area they say we have a million listeners no let's be honest this
[57:24.880 --> 57:28.680]  isn't listening area this is real listeners conservatively one way or
[57:28.680 --> 57:34.320]  another 15 million people worldwide and more than half of those are in the US
[57:34.320 --> 57:42.200]  every week that's a lot of people and so every time somebody gets arrested they
[57:42.200 --> 57:46.000]  go get on their computer and if they visited info wars.com or prison planet
[57:46.000 --> 57:50.240]  calm they have a press release as part of a demonization campaign of this guy
[57:50.240 --> 57:55.320]  killed his wife or this guy shot a cop or this guy you know didn't cut his toenails
[57:55.320 --> 58:00.720]  and it's Alex Jones' fault and they go on in multiple newspapers today to imply
[58:00.720 --> 58:04.680]  that I'm an extremist and I'm bad I mean this is just demonization the first
[58:04.680 --> 58:07.920]  minute and it's like Rush Limbaugh and they were trying to get him off air you
[58:07.920 --> 58:11.480]  know for saying why do we have to pay for this woman's contraception and I
[58:11.480 --> 58:15.080]  don't like a lot of what Rush Limbaugh does he's attacked me a few times I mean
[58:15.080 --> 58:18.760]  I'm directly up against him on the radio I would you know do great if Rush
[58:18.760 --> 58:22.880]  Limbaugh fell over dead but I don't want him to because I believe in the first
[58:22.880 --> 58:28.200]  amendment okay and you know I've defended Limbaugh they're trying to get him off
[58:28.200 --> 58:33.800]  the air and supported him so and I went and advertised on his show by the way
[58:33.800 --> 58:37.320]  we ran some ads just to try because you know what we got to stand together or
[58:37.320 --> 58:46.640]  hang separate that's simple this is GCN the Genesis communications radio
[58:46.640 --> 58:48.760]  network

[01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:12.280]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:19.800]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:23.280]  Alex Jones
[01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:38.120]  we are into our number two we are going to open the phones up throughout the
[01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:44.160]  shower interspersed with the latest news on the economy the latest news on the
[01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:50.560]  election I haven't even gotten in to that big stack of news but Romney is just
[01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:56.440]  turbo surging everywhere and so it should certainly make it interesting
[01:00:56.440 --> 01:01:01.320]  again you can't help it Romney's kind of the devil you don't know so you
[01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:06.000]  automatically at a subconscious level root for him because Obama's got the ATF
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:12.040]  shipping guns in the Mexico Obama has media matters that the the White House
[01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:16.200]  publicly runs you know saying they want to shut us down and infiltrate and all
[01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:23.200]  you know and infiltrate media and just really authoritarian nasties that and
[01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:27.440]  they see me because I'm pro-gun anti-abortion as a right-winger and so
[01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:30.520]  attack me out of hand I mean it's not fun being on the White House enemies
[01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:34.120]  list and that that came out two years ago in the newspapers that I was amongst
[01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:38.200]  50 people on a White House enemies list and believe me the proof is look all
[01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:41.800]  over the place so I mean I will enjoy not being on the White House
[01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:46.120]  enemies list I'll probably get back on it because I'm going to criticize Romney
[01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:49.960]  but see when World Net Daily went after Bush for NAFTA and Gad in the North
[01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:56.080]  American Union and they didn't do dirty tricks against World Net Daily we had
[01:01:56.080 --> 01:02:00.680]  dirty tricks but it was usually by the Democratic Party establishment when I
[01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:04.160]  was defending the Second Amendment stuff show Republicans are horrible I mean
[01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:07.920]  let's get that but but for whatever reason they don't they don't want to eat
[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:11.960]  us you know what I mean I mean it's like the Tyrannosaurus Rex kind of walks by
[01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:15.960]  me in the jungle whenever even though I'm a throwing rocks at it it leaves me
[01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:20.640]  alone the Democrats are just such authoritarians their instinct to be
[01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:24.640]  control freaks and just run everything and dominate everything look at
[01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:29.040]  Homeland Security in the last four years under Obama the groping started all of
[01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:33.600]  it the naked body scanners was a leftover of shirt off but into Obama
[01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:38.160]  accelerating so they're all bad and I know we're gonna be disappointed in Romney
[01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:40.800]  and then they're probably still gonna steal the election from him it's just
[01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:43.680]  it just that it's it's like you know you're sick of this group you're like
[01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:47.040]  huh you automatically like the other group at a subconscious level but I know
[01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:53.240]  that's a delusion I know it's a delusion so let's let's start going to your
[01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:59.360]  calls right now David in Florida listing on iTunes welcome sir hey thanks for
[01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:03.680]  taking my call Alex thank you brother thank you man yeah I wanted to ask if you've seen
[01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:08.800]  this President Obama makes a statement on a hurricane Sandy video that the
[01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:15.600]  White House put out on the 29th we have the the the one where he makes political
[01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:20.480]  statements yeah we have that yeah I mean he's just like talking about like all
[01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:24.840]  this martial law kind of sounded stuff but you know he's saying when state and
[01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:28.720]  local officials tell you to evacuate don't question nor don't delay just
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:33.680]  follow their instructions and then he says if the public's not following
[01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:37.840]  instructions we might have fatalities that could have been avoided yeah he's
[01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:41.920]  made several statements we also make electioneering comments which one are
[01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:45.160]  you talking about what's the headline on the video you've got it's called
[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:49.320]  president Obama makes a statement on hurricane Sandy and it's on the White
[01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:54.400]  House YouTube channel okay president Obama makes a statement on hurricane
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:57.880]  Sandy yeah I think that's the one we've got we'll we'll actually play that
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:01.160]  coming up you're right I want to get to that you also made some other statements
[01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:04.000]  that are about the election you know in the middle of it trying to look
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:08.320]  presidential but still the media is criticizing Romney for running around
[01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:11.720]  the hurricane trying to give people food obviously a political stunt but also
[01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:14.840]  you want to help folks so it's you know the right thing but also it's a stunt
[01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:20.200]  you can't deny that but then why is Obama doing stunts okay yeah he says at
[01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:24.320]  the end the great thing about such situations like this is we all pull
[01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:28.440]  together as a nation so I just think it's super creepy that he's like up there
[01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:32.040]  grandstanding as the savior when I mean they've got all this weather
[01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:36.640]  modification science and technology that they're using I mean it's just yeah but
[01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:39.680]  you heard the you heard us say today they said the scientists say there's
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:43.040]  none of that they're experts it doesn't matter if you can pull it up on the
[01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:46.800]  government websites they're doing it I mean if you see an urban warfare drill
[01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:50.840]  and report it they'll say you didn't see it even if you have video you didn't see
[01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:55.520]  anything son I bless you sir good points yeah we'll get to that video more

[01:08:57.480 --> 01:09:03.080]  we're going to be looking at the latest election numbers and Romney surging in
[01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:08.960]  key battle ground states across the United States also amazing documents at
[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:14.040]  Washington Post Obama ordered DHS to control hurricanes you cannot make this
[01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:21.840]  up looters plague hurricane victims post sandy thieves poses utility workers to
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:27.280]  con residence wide-scale looting all over the east coast and an incredible
[01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:35.440]  article breaking at info wars.com that is not getting attention anywhere you
[01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:39.480]  know we first began to break people on Twitter and Facebook calling for
[01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:44.960]  murdering Romney and rioting if Obama loses unless there's election fraud if
[01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:48.520]  you look at all the scientific polls the electoral college the popular vote it
[01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:53.720]  looks like Romney is going to win handily right now barring some major
[01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:58.480]  flub or something else and again I feel like I'm calling the Don King boxing
[01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:03.840]  match it doesn't really matter either way I'm sick of team Obama and fast and
[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:06.960]  furious and their attacks on the free press but I mean I'm not holding my
[01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:11.160]  breath for Romney to be any better the point is is it looks like Romney's
[01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:15.120]  right now I'm going to win I was on man cowl this morning I'll be back on
[01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:19.960]  tomorrow his big syndicated show Eric Muller and you know he said what's your
[01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:25.800]  prediction I'm predicting Romney will win barring that election fraud comes in
[01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:30.120]  but if Romney does win ladies and gentlemen we've seen that when people
[01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:35.080]  en masse on Twitter whether there's white skateboarders or black inner city
[01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:39.000]  youth whenever these groups organize things more often than not it ends up
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:45.040]  happening you know I go out to the hiking bike trail I go out to Martin
[01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:49.480]  Springs I go out places and everywhere it's the new social system it's been
[01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:53.200]  going on for many years but now it's really big and you'll see groups of
[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:56.680]  people meeting to go on jogs that don't know each other groups of people that
[01:10:56.680 --> 01:11:01.520]  don't know each other to go rock climbing groups of singles meeting at
[01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:09.120]  Martin Springs at sunset let me tell you it's a party and it's happening and but
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:15.720]  people also organize robbing houses they also organize robbing people at the
[01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:19.080]  fair you see this all over the country at state and county fairs criminals will
[01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:23.680]  say let's all go to the fair and rob people it's the new culture it's kind
[01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:27.720]  of out of Grand Theft Auto and all the show these video games where you rape
[01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:32.720]  the hooker was that wasn't Grand Theft Auto that was another one of the games I
[01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:36.920]  did a review of years ago where you rape the hooker and don't pay her and then
[01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:41.320]  you get bonus points or you run over an old bag lady with a shopping cart and
[01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:47.160]  you get bonuses I listened to satellite radio quite a bit on XM and the new
[01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:53.160]  cool comedy genre on the comedy radio shows is to make fun of a girl who grew
[01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:57.000]  up in an iron lung paralyzed but wrote children's books and was successful and
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:00.920]  died you know at 60 something they spent 10 minutes making fun of her calling
[01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:04.960]  her ugly how pathetic she was our life was meant nothing your family's glad
[01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:10.920]  you're dead just the nastiest stuff demonic stuff you can imagine and so it's
[01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:17.320]  it's total gangster culture I run into it across the board it is now the dominant
[01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:24.360]  culture in America black white Hispanic Asian is people trying to act thug life
[01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:27.880]  this was big 10 years ago out in Hollywood when I first started getting
[01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:31.680]  contacts in Hollywood and being invited out there by different people I mean I'd
[01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:35.000]  be there at a famous director's house and they'd have gangster tattoos all of
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:39.080]  rum and be talking about thug life I guess that's why in the movie
[01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:42.720]  idiocracy amazing director and political mind and listener of the shows
[01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:45.680]  where she's gonna come on son I talked to him a few weeks ago Mike judge
[01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:51.880]  idiocracy you know the colonel over the guy at the army base at Fort Hood he
[01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:57.200]  becomes a pimp and and and the pimp game you know a white colonel becomes the
[01:12:57.200 --> 01:13:01.200]  pimp commander I mean you know the point is is that's really what it's like
[01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:04.000]  folks I mean you'll be sitting there at somebody's house is worth a hundred
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:10.360]  million dollars and it's all how the pimp games rolling and it's just amazing
[01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:14.840]  that you know you'll go to a professional basketball players house and
[01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:19.360]  there's 15 famous basketball players and they're all acting like thugs people
[01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:24.440]  think this is cool and I'm gonna go to your calls I just want to point out
[01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:28.320]  Watson has now posted where they say they're going to kill white people they're
[01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:31.360]  what they're going to loot in areas that are being looted and they're gonna rape
[01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:36.680]  white women and you know what I mean whenever I've seen white supremacist
[01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:39.680]  groups saying they want to organize and kill black people I've come out and said
[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:44.400]  it's wrong but whenever it's so acceptable now in the culture and the
[01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:48.120]  media pushes that it's good to be racist towards white people and that's done so
[01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:52.880]  blacks and whites have enmity and fight with each other it's it's divide and
[01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:57.640]  conquer multiculturalism the way it's sold is meant to get people fighting with
[01:13:57.640 --> 01:14:03.520]  each other and to sell the lowest common denominator I mean I've had KRS one on
[01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:09.800]  about this professor Griff's talked about it how how going back to the 80s
[01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:14.040]  and 90s the media MTV and others and I've talked to high-level MTV people I'll
[01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:18.280]  just leave it at that who were there when they said you're gonna mainline
[01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:26.280]  gangster rap as the new phenomenon and they force fed it to be a cultural
[01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:30.280]  destroying system I mean you see what's happened to the black community folks
[01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:34.680]  it's been designed for every community and it is outrageous and folks you read
[01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:40.360]  this stuff what's amazing is the people on Sunday and Monday that plan to loot
[01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:45.000]  they went out and looted in the area as they said they'd loot just like the white
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:49.400]  skateboarders you know said they were gonna go riot at a movie theater because
[01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:53.880]  there weren't enough tickets they went and did it I mean let me tell you that
[01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:58.040]  people say they're gonna go meet at the hike and bike trail they do it people
[01:14:58.040 --> 01:15:03.440]  say they're gonna go this is the new social interaction and you're going to
[01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:06.760]  see more attacks and you're gonna see you do have muggings and killings and
[01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:10.560]  attacks and looting going on right now all over the East Coast and the media is
[01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:14.920]  barely covering it and this is a big news article shameless looters display
[01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:22.240]  stolen goods on Twitter and Paul Watson is now updating its sandy loot crew plans
[01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:28.440]  more heist and violence tonight and he needs he's updated at the bottom that
[01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:32.840]  it's now calls for rape and murder but it needs to probably be added as an
[01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:41.800]  update to the top and we also need to again continue to red link this up at
[01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:47.600]  and look at this I got 20 pipe bombs ready for tonight tonight we be chicken
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:53.720]  empty hospitals or to medical bleep you know that's the big thing TSA steals out

[01:15:57.320 --> 01:16:00.560]  to these Twitter accounts a lot of these are very old they look to be real and
[01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:05.320]  just like the others have been proven to be real I mean this is really really
[01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:14.160]  really really bad and we need to get the news on this so please I've tweeted it
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:19.080]  out at real Alex Jones on Twitter please follow us at twitter.com for
[01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:22.240]  special Alex Jones I put it out on our Facebook while we still have it that's

[01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:33.120]  Facebook sensors Navy SEALs to protect on Benghazi gate and all they did was put
[01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:38.240]  out this little meme image what you do on Facebook we do this saying oh but
[01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:42.760]  Obama called the SEALs and they got bin Laden when the SEALs called Obama they
[01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:46.320]  got denied talking about the Navy SEALs that asked for help and and and got
[01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:50.120]  refused because the group killing them has now been confirmed to have been
[01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:54.280]  al-Qaeda hired to run security in Benghazi that's why they stood down I
[01:16:54.280 --> 01:17:03.600]  don't know what's behind all this but it is pretty darn amazing that this is
[01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:07.800]  going on and of course we had our thing about this deleted off Facebook and
[01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:11.240]  there's the article Facebook now centering political poses hate speech
[01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:15.560]  and and click on our link there if you can guys because yeah the blue link
[01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:20.760]  there at the top because look at what they did of your TV watcher radio
[01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:26.120]  listeners can just go to the site it says we remove content you posted we
[01:17:26.120 --> 01:17:31.640]  remove the following content you posted because it violates Facebook's statement
[01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:34.920]  of rights and responsibilities and it says it's a picture of a summit bin
[01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:43.360]  Laden it says Al CIA to that's it so but it's not just us anybody talking about
[01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:48.000]  al-Qaeda or the Navy SEALs or the government funding al-Qaeda it's being
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:54.320]  deleted and it looks like a bots doing it so again where's the media covering
[01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:58.440]  and Breitbart comm is covering this drugs report comm is covering this who
[01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:04.360]  else is covering this info wars comm no one else is covering look if they can
[01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:11.240]  get away with this Navy SEAL Association special ops 2012.com who's run TV ads
[01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:14.840]  and stuff they've been told they're gonna have their site shut down these are
[01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:20.680]  public Navy SEALs retired not actively some of them are net former Navy SEAL
[01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:26.800]  commanders again kernels and people they can't have a Facebook and people say
[01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:30.560]  well Facebook's its own site no no they advertise as a commons where you put

[01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:51.000]  ring got a note saying and we have that list of the article on his little
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:57.560]  Facebook saying do not talk about politics or you'll be deleted I mean
[01:18:57.560 --> 01:19:01.800]  imagine America that's like communist China do not talk about politics or
[01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:07.120]  you'll be deleted I mean ladies and gentlemen we've got a fight for the
[01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:11.800]  First Amendment here we have got to do this and we've got to exercise it even
[01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:17.160]  if you don't agree with something you better stand for that person or
[01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:23.080]  organizations right to say it unless it's a call for violence or a call to
[01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:26.000]  hurt people that's a call to action that's illegal that's a
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:31.840]  terroristic threat and instead people on Twitter that are reporting people
[01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:36.840]  calling for violence and calling for looting and calling for killing if you
[01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:43.560]  report it you're being deleted if you report it you're being deleted I must
[01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:48.400]  say that again if you report it you're being deleted so if you try to stop
[01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:53.440]  people organizing crime in a racketeering operation you are being
[01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:57.400]  deleted because you know what I'm starting to think Obama's controllers
[01:19:57.400 --> 01:20:02.160]  may want to stir up riots as an October surprise have you ever wanted to
[01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:05.920]  generate your own supply of electrical power even save money on your electric

[01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:05.680]  furious and minimize it they took one agent that had blown the whistle God
[01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:10.840]  bless them who the media tried to then demonize he's suing him I saw in the
[01:34:10.840 --> 01:34:16.640]  news last week what is he's doing is it time the point is they took one agent
[01:34:16.640 --> 01:34:22.560]  who didn't like him ordering gun dealers to shell criminals guns that was just
[01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:27.080]  part of the program it was direct gun shipments into Mexico hand grenades
[01:34:27.080 --> 01:34:32.400]  that's all come out in court so instead of an Obama phone you get an Obama
[01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:37.960]  hand grenade or Obama machine gun just amazing by the way Joel Scals is gonna
[01:34:37.960 --> 01:34:41.880]  be on this for an hour and a half former Marine Corps fighter pilot in
[01:34:41.880 --> 01:34:47.640]  Vietnam researcher construction specialist the author best-selling

[01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:05.600]  extras unbelievably powerful and again we're not saying move out the middle of
[01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:08.120]  nowhere cuz we're gonna get new tomorrow we're explaining the elite are
[01:35:08.120 --> 01:35:12.240]  building bunkers why they're doing it if you've got to stay in big cities the
[01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:17.280]  safest places per city escape routes on small roads and things that people don't
[01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:22.840]  know about I mean Joel has put together research that nobody's done and I follow
[01:35:22.840 --> 01:35:25.960]  his research well I already done a bunch of research and moved to a certain area
[01:35:25.960 --> 01:35:30.000]  the Texas Hill Country and he was like wow incredible you move there that's the
[01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.960]  best area I'm like well yeah I know that's in your new edition of your book
[01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:36.200]  how do you know that well he's built I don't know like five six retreats or
[01:35:36.200 --> 01:35:41.160]  something just in my area I mean he's always somewhere building a retreat he
[01:35:41.160 --> 01:35:44.200]  builds you know multi-million dollar ones and expensive ones but I'm not
[01:35:44.200 --> 01:35:50.960]  pitching that that fact I'm not involved in that the point is we carry his the
[01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:55.000]  secure home book for people that want to build secure systems from very
[01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:58.400]  inexpensive to very expensive the strategic relocation that's like a big
[01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:02.800]  roadmap book that breaks down different safer countries safer regions continents
[01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:08.480]  weather climate pollution of the water I mean it's incredible the lexicon of

[01:37:34.680 --> 01:37:41.920]  few headlines and I'm going right to your calls Marcus Steve Dalton Rich Joey
[01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:46.200]  we're gonna get to all of you here in just a moment but Romney GOP suddenly
[01:37:46.200 --> 01:37:52.200]  plunging on the Democratic turf AP and it just goes over all the different
[01:37:52.200 --> 01:37:58.840]  battleground states Ohio Colorado Pennsylvania Minnesota I mean where it's
[01:37:58.840 --> 01:38:03.760]  traditionally Democrat and he's dominating rompy of course if Romney
[01:38:03.760 --> 01:38:07.640]  doesn't buck the globalist and do the right thing in four years they'll replace
[01:38:07.640 --> 01:38:11.440]  him if he gets in people are hitting the reset button like I said I mean that's
[01:38:11.440 --> 01:38:15.400]  really what this is all about that that's why as bad as Romney is on the
[01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:17.600]  Second Amendment everything else people are like well at least he's better than
[01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:23.440]  Obama poll Romney closes gap on Obama in Michigan so not just Pennsylvania
[01:38:23.440 --> 01:38:30.120]  Colorado Ohio I mean this is just domination here that's Detroit news the
[01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:35.280]  examiner some CGOP voting tsunami coming yeah yeah that goes over some of the
[01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:43.240]  polls new polls show Obama Casey still up in PA yeah it's a dead heat but it's
[01:38:43.240 --> 01:38:48.680]  closing Obama gets a little electioneering and during FEMA briefing
[01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:51.520]  we have that FEMA briefing we're gonna get to after some calls here in a
[01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:56.680]  moment and we've got a special guest who's gonna be in studio continuing MSNBC
[01:38:56.680 --> 01:39:01.880]  ridicules Romney for collecting food and supplies for Sandy victims well of
[01:39:01.880 --> 01:39:08.600]  course if he didn't do it they would attack him it's just ridiculous Obama
[01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:13.480]  dominates Romney in Russian opinion poll yeah they really think Romney's bad
[01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:18.680]  news cuz he said Russia's our main enemy which the globalist love again rich
[01:39:18.680 --> 01:39:23.640]  senior senator told me networks may have White House emails commanding
[01:39:23.640 --> 01:39:27.600]  counterterrorism group stand down on Benghazi rescue yeah if that was brought
[01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:31.600]  out that would bring down Obama so we've got that but I don't believe anything
[01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:35.760]  coming out of Newt again rich mr. New World Order's mouth who's been for
[01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:40.720]  restricting guns open borders and wrote the forward to two books calling for
[01:39:40.720 --> 01:39:44.200]  world government Alvin Heidi Tofler's books I forget the names of my read them
[01:39:44.200 --> 01:39:47.960]  years ago go look it up he called for chipping everyone if you don't believe
[01:39:47.960 --> 01:39:51.960]  me look it up I mean it's some really sick stuff I want to get off into a
[01:39:51.960 --> 01:39:56.040]  jag about newt again rich I mean it's like Herman Cain I mean the guy is a
[01:39:56.040 --> 01:40:01.560]  federal reserve governor the guy you know lied about the women and my point is
[01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:05.560]  just don't put your trust in anybody that a politician that's gotten to that
[01:40:05.560 --> 01:40:10.160]  level because they've been bought and sold a hundred times over okay let's go
[01:40:10.160 --> 01:40:14.080]  to your calls Marcos in California thanks for holding you're on the air
[01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:19.320]  what's your take on all of this actually it's Marcus but thanks for having me
[01:40:19.320 --> 01:40:24.120]  Alex I just want to say me and my two coworkers here in California listen to

[01:40:34.720 --> 01:40:37.320]  to touch on with something that you're actually talking about earlier you know
[01:40:37.320 --> 01:40:42.000]  you were kind of going over like like how a lot of the games and a lot of things
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:45.840]  that the government kind of more so promoted like the gang violence and
[01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:51.080]  Doug lies being cool and all that I mean being 23 I have plenty of friends of
[01:40:51.080 --> 01:40:53.400]  my head especially out here in California you know Los Angeles is
[01:40:53.400 --> 01:40:58.960]  actually known for that I mean and more ways than one but um what I more so
[01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:04.160]  one to touch on was like I kind of see on Facebook and Twitter and all that how
[01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:09.320]  ignorance is way way way too glorified and and not only that exactly people
[01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:13.800]  that are even smart will act gangsterish and dumb down because it's seen as
[01:41:13.800 --> 01:41:19.840]  totally sexy and I'm just so sick of like being at the park or something and
[01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:23.640]  there's like teenagers trying to act like gangsters and I'm not looking for
[01:41:23.640 --> 01:41:26.600]  trouble but I mean you mess with me I'm gonna start literally beating people's
[01:41:26.600 --> 01:41:31.120]  brains out and I mean that's just how I am I mean you mess with me I don't have
[01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:35.160]  a governor you're gonna get attacked like a savage gorilla is on top of you I
[01:41:35.160 --> 01:41:39.160]  mean that's just how I am and and I'm just and so many of these people are
[01:41:39.160 --> 01:41:43.120]  wimps and the minute they say something you go okay you know you got a problem
[01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:48.200]  then they back off it's all it's all again acting like you're tough it's like
[01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:52.840]  all these guys in UFC shirts that'll for no reason so you got a problem buddy
[01:41:52.840 --> 01:41:56.120]  when you're you know at a grocery store or something you're like no not a
[01:41:56.120 --> 01:41:59.200]  problem they start bowing up and then all the sudden you can't help it you're
[01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:03.640]  like well go ahead and swing punk let's go they're like hey man what's your
[01:42:03.640 --> 01:42:08.600]  problem well wait again it's all about acting like they're these really cool
[01:42:08.600 --> 01:42:12.480]  people when I'll guarantee you they hadn't been in a hospital you know with a
[01:42:12.480 --> 01:42:16.000]  concussion I bet they haven't had their leg broken in a fight I bet they haven't
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:20.160]  killed you know somebody in a fight these people have never really lived and
[01:42:20.160 --> 01:42:23.560]  they and they and they want you to think they're some powerful gangster I'm sorry
[01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:26.840]  go ahead that's okay I mean what I really was gonna touch on to those which
[01:42:26.840 --> 01:42:30.320]  you see a lot is like I'm on Facebook a lot of my friends are like Obama this
[01:42:30.320 --> 01:42:34.200]  Obama dad Obama's amazing and he's this mad he's my favorite president two
[01:42:34.200 --> 01:42:38.440]  terms two terms this man I'm really just like you know what I'll do is on these
[01:42:38.440 --> 01:42:41.800]  things I'm getting into huge political arguments it's like people that I
[01:42:41.800 --> 01:42:44.760]  considered close friends that are calling me just scrutinizing me calling me
[01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:48.360]  every name in the book just because I'll post like a link about Obama and the
[01:42:48.360 --> 01:42:52.360]  NDA or I'll post a link about FEMA camps and like really is that who you want
[01:42:52.360 --> 01:42:56.240]  no no no they think it's cool to peck at someone who's informed that's what I'm
[01:42:56.240 --> 01:43:00.760]  telling you it's like idiocracy the movie where if you know how to talk you
[01:43:00.760 --> 01:43:04.600]  know they make fun of you and go what are you gay yeah we'll actually use a
[01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:10.600]  more pejorative pejorative term the point is is that is that it you know
[01:43:10.600 --> 01:43:15.560]  it that people revel in ignorance but it's not just kids and people acting like
[01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:21.560]  thugs it's yuppies and other people will giggle and laugh at you you know most
[01:43:21.560 --> 01:43:25.000]  people actually are starting to wake up but I have countless folks any time I'm
[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:29.120]  in public come over and shake my hand black wide old young Hispanic you know
[01:43:29.120 --> 01:43:34.280]  Italian immigrants people from Russia Japan I mean people worldwide listen and
[01:43:34.280 --> 01:43:37.160]  watch and they've experienced it in their countries they know it in a joke
[01:43:37.160 --> 01:43:40.200]  especially people that have come from tyranny they've seen it before and
[01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:44.360]  they're like you know like hey you're absolutely right thank God for what
[01:43:44.360 --> 01:43:47.280]  you're doing and they're electrified when they talk to you because they're
[01:43:47.280 --> 01:43:51.120]  concerned they're living in the real world but we've got people in this
[01:43:51.120 --> 01:43:55.000]  country that have had so much freedom so long they think it's all a big joke
[01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:59.040]  nihilistically and they're literally whistling past the graveyard go ahead
[01:43:59.040 --> 01:44:02.600]  sorry no that's okay and just one question before we do get off and I
[01:44:02.600 --> 01:44:05.920]  got plenty of things to touch on I just want to ask you what do you think about
[01:44:05.920 --> 01:44:10.480]  like what I've just hated was in these all these elections you know all the
[01:44:10.480 --> 01:44:12.960]  debates and everything they've had whether it be the vice president or the
[01:44:12.960 --> 01:44:16.800]  president themselves no one wants to mention that like what's coming up in
[01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:21.760]  the next upcoming year like the NDAA the killing of the dollar you mean I mean
[01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:26.840]  they touch on all of it no no no exactly people think it is a attribute to not
[01:44:26.840 --> 01:44:29.640]  be informed or involved thank you for your call great points we'll go to more
[01:44:29.640 --> 01:44:34.680]  calls in a moment but finishing my point 90% of people that have got them you
[01:44:34.680 --> 01:44:39.520]  know the will to come over and talk to somebody they're going to be listeners
[01:44:39.520 --> 01:44:44.160]  because hey they like you when people dislike you you'll be in a restaurant
[01:44:44.160 --> 01:44:47.600]  you'll see some you know guys smiling and laughing it's usually kind of a
[01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:51.640]  liberal professor psychologist type a lot of times I freak him out I go you're
[01:44:51.640 --> 01:44:56.160]  a psychologist aren't you and they'll go well how do you know that and I go well
[01:44:56.160 --> 01:44:59.920]  you're a priest class you're on a power trip you think you know everything I can
[01:44:59.920 --> 01:45:03.600]  tell what you are it really freaks him out that you can guess who they are but
[01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:10.200]  sometimes it's kind of a yuppie new voracious you know guy out at 55 when
[01:45:10.200 --> 01:45:13.280]  it's hardly I've had them come over a few times it's always these certain types
[01:45:13.280 --> 01:45:17.640]  or it's punk kids but they'll they'll you'll see them laughing at you and
[01:45:17.640 --> 01:45:20.680]  they'll finally say good spares either us and look to see if it hurts your
[01:45:20.680 --> 01:45:24.320]  feelings a lot of times I'm busy I'll ignore them but if they come over and
[01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:29.920]  start making jokes like are the black helicopters gonna get me or the Martians
[01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:34.000]  gonna get me and I'll look at them and I'll say hey how many family members you
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:38.040]  got that have got cancer right now or who've died of it young if you think
[01:45:38.040 --> 01:45:43.160]  cancer is dying you know in the vaccines is funny go ahead and laugh but if I
[01:45:43.160 --> 01:45:47.360]  was you I'd care about GMO sterilizing your butt I'd care about aspartame
[01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:50.960]  giving your brain tumors don't sit there and come over and make a joke at me
[01:45:50.960 --> 01:45:55.840]  because you think all this is funny they'll go oh I mean I actually agree
[01:45:55.840 --> 01:46:00.200]  with you on a lot of stuff and I asked my friend Tommy Pilata years ago about
[01:46:00.200 --> 01:46:04.160]  why they'll get in your face when you go back they'll respond and grovel and I
[01:46:04.160 --> 01:46:07.800]  said it shows they're really awake and he goes no that's not what it is Alex and
[01:46:07.800 --> 01:46:14.400]  I actually won't wait to learn he was right in a general sense they are just
[01:46:14.400 --> 01:46:18.320]  flotsam and jetsam they have no view of their own and so when you're
[01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:23.160]  authoritative with them and don't grovel and fear they just want to make you feel
[01:46:23.160 --> 01:46:27.560]  bad to make themselves feel good when you slam them back they're such followers
[01:46:27.560 --> 01:46:33.360]  they'll start groveling because you know that guys walk over you usually the kind
[01:46:33.360 --> 01:46:37.960]  of redneck top go hey kind of hits you on the shoulder how you doing Alex and
[01:46:37.960 --> 01:46:43.640]  then grab your hand and start trying to crush it you know those types you'll
[01:46:43.640 --> 01:46:47.560]  pull your hand back they're like oh yeah yeah I really like what you're doing
[01:46:47.560 --> 01:46:51.280]  bet you're glad the troops are dying you know stuff like that and I'll just be
[01:46:51.280 --> 01:46:54.880]  like hey man if you don't agree with me you don't need to talk to me so get out
[01:46:54.880 --> 01:46:57.920]  of my face and the fact you don't grovel to them they're like oh no it's all
[01:46:57.920 --> 01:47:04.840]  right it's all right I just might just get out of my way and again it's the
[01:47:04.840 --> 01:47:09.120]  reality people know reality the fact that you're not starting to fight but
[01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:11.840]  you're already thinking about how you're gonna bounce their head off the
[01:47:11.840 --> 01:47:14.600]  concrete repeatedly because I'm not gonna play games in somebody that's about to
[01:47:14.600 --> 01:47:17.360]  assault me I'm just gonna jump on top of you and slam your head in the ground a
[01:47:17.360 --> 01:47:22.880]  bunch I'm gonna attack you with 110% energy immediately and you better hope
[01:47:22.880 --> 01:47:25.760]  you better hope you're a wrestling champion or something I'm not trying to
[01:47:25.760 --> 01:47:28.800]  be like a wrestler and talk like I'm tough my point is it's like that in
[01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:33.800]  politics or life or anywhere else you've got to be explosive in business you've
[01:47:33.800 --> 01:47:38.400]  got to be explosive in combat you've got to be explosive in your responses to
[01:47:38.400 --> 01:47:41.960]  everything and when these yuppies and ninnies and gangbangers and people want
[01:47:41.960 --> 01:47:46.120]  to get in your face and impact you you've got to take it personally America
[01:47:46.120 --> 01:47:49.560]  and the rest of the world and get aggressive and say don't tread on me I
[01:47:49.560 --> 01:47:53.480]  ain't looking for trouble but if you are looking for it you came to the right
[01:47:53.480 --> 01:47:56.960]  place because none of us are gonna get out of this alive and we have an
[01:47:56.960 --> 01:48:02.120]  attitude of rolling over like a bunch of sheep wolves are gonna come free men are
[01:48:02.120 --> 01:48:06.760]  ready to fight for their freedom anytime it needs to be done but you've
[01:48:06.760 --> 01:48:11.000]  got to have more than just guts you've got to have an intellect and a battlefield
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:15.680]  perspective to know what's going on in this world and war this life is a war
[01:48:15.680 --> 01:48:20.760]  life is a battle and let me tell you what winning is being moral being strong
[01:48:20.760 --> 01:48:24.600]  making the right decisions raising your children to be good people and upholding
[01:48:24.600 --> 01:48:28.920]  your family name and moving the species forward that's what victory is and that's
[01:48:28.920 --> 01:48:33.800]  what we should be looking for let's go ahead and talk to Dalton in Georgia I'm
[01:48:33.800 --> 01:48:39.720]  sorry I'm ranting Dalton I'm out of control hey Alex happy Reformation Day
[01:48:39.720 --> 01:48:46.280]  happy yeah I'm just trying to pull up what you said what you say yeah today's
[01:48:46.280 --> 01:48:49.200]  Reformation Day I was here to happy Halloween I was giving you happy
[01:48:49.200 --> 01:48:57.600]  Reformation Day you remember you said one time that if the FBI harasses you
[01:48:57.600 --> 01:49:04.840]  you better get out there more yes yeah well my wife had a visit from the FBI
[01:49:04.840 --> 01:49:11.760]  she got pulled by Georgia State Patrol and and just didn't comply with
[01:49:11.760 --> 01:49:16.320]  everything he locked her up I went got her out later that night and about three
[01:49:16.320 --> 01:49:20.720]  weeks later the FBI came by I wanted to know why she wears a head covering and
[01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:24.720]  why her and a friend of hers had matching head cover it says you know we
[01:49:24.720 --> 01:49:28.680]  Christian you know and she's got that conviction just like me and walking the
[01:49:28.680 --> 01:49:32.520]  church they take their head off she you know keeps a head cover so you're kind
[01:49:32.520 --> 01:49:37.160]  of like a Mennonite or Amish no I'm not I don't dress like that I'm
[01:49:37.160 --> 01:49:40.800]  sure it's not working you know but not as a lot more people are going back to
[01:49:40.800 --> 01:49:44.160]  old-fashioned Christian stuff so so the cop took her to jail because she was
[01:49:44.160 --> 01:49:48.320]  wearing a scarf on her head well she got in the police car and did Alex Jones
[01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:54.720]  ran right right in the camera they got a camera in the police cars now so I got
[01:49:54.720 --> 01:49:59.000]  that might be one of the reasons also you know how you told people get out
[01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:02.880]  there as much as you can well I started having a good rapport with the local
[01:50:02.880 --> 01:50:08.040]  radio here and so every morning I give an intelligence report and nine times out
[01:50:08.040 --> 01:50:10.680]  of 10 it ends up being your talking points without me even knowing it you
[01:50:10.680 --> 01:50:14.600]  know but I just can't say you because they ever come I say you he says oh my
[01:50:14.600 --> 01:50:19.360]  god would you know so notice you already know what's going on
[01:50:19.360 --> 01:50:22.440]  without even hearing me because we don't even have to hear each other or know
[01:50:22.440 --> 01:50:27.200]  each other we know what's important now he came by he wanted to know why I had a
[01:50:27.200 --> 01:50:33.160]  root cellar right that's a big deal with it with the food safety bill and he
[01:50:33.160 --> 01:50:36.440]  wanted to know why I had tense up I had a couple tense up because we were doing
[01:50:36.440 --> 01:50:41.000]  Cabernacles we hadn't gone back to Judy isn't we just doing the whole Bible instead of he's
[01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:47.600]  touring Christmash you know so we know listen if you were on Twitter saying
[01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:51.400]  kill Romney burn things down and murder people you wouldn't get a visit but yeah
[01:50:51.400 --> 01:50:55.360]  the fact that you're a Christian and engaging in an ancient Christian
[01:50:55.360 --> 01:51:01.400]  rituals is terrorism sir FEMA has taught George Washington is bad the worst
[01:51:01.400 --> 01:51:05.240]  drought in 50 years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks the
[01:51:05.240 --> 01:51:09.400]  hottest half year on record 78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought

[01:51:17.960 --> 01:51:21.520]  ranchers out of business blowing up your food prices the only strategy to
[01:51:21.520 --> 01:51:25.600]  counter this is to freeze your food cost to today's prices by getting your own
[01:51:25.600 --> 01:51:29.600]  supply of foods from eat foods direct now as the price of raw ingredients
[01:51:29.600 --> 01:51:33.120]  increases eat foods will have to raise prices to now is the time to get your

[01:58:58.440 --> 01:59:01.760]  cheeses but to healthy homecrafted sources for fermented foods like
[01:59:01.760 --> 01:59:05.640]  sauerkraut yogurt and kefir it seems there's a war on life-giving foods with
[01:59:05.640 --> 01:59:09.080]  living enzymes and healthy bacteria but frankly I'm not sure what the food
[01:59:09.080 --> 01:59:12.080]  police are so afraid of these remarkable foods have been around since the

[02:08:35.440 --> 02:08:41.960]  welcome back we are into the third hour of worldwide broadcast here today in the
[02:08:41.960 --> 02:08:47.960]  last two weeks there have been thousands of tweets on Twitter calling for
[02:08:47.960 --> 02:08:56.080]  rioting if Obama loses and calling for killing Mitt Romney now undoubtedly out
[02:08:56.080 --> 02:08:59.960]  of thousands of tweets some of them are fake accounts joke accounts many of them
[02:08:59.960 --> 02:09:05.600]  know have hundreds and thousands of tweets and followers and our real accounts
[02:09:05.600 --> 02:09:09.280]  and the secret services responded to some but not to a lot and confirmed its real
[02:09:09.280 --> 02:09:14.960]  people moronically out there saying that my point is is that if you mildly talk
[02:09:14.960 --> 02:09:19.800]  about the president generally you got a secret service visit we've had them just
[02:09:19.800 --> 02:09:22.680]  over things that listeners have posted that was mild and like why are you here
[02:09:22.680 --> 02:09:25.520]  talking to me about it well how do you feel about your listeners saying that
[02:09:25.520 --> 02:09:30.080]  well number one I don't want any violence on the president whether it be
[02:09:30.080 --> 02:09:33.280]  Mitt Romney or Obama or Bill Clinton because they're really just globalist
[02:09:33.280 --> 02:09:39.120]  puppets and that would make them a martyr so we've talked about that but
[02:09:39.120 --> 02:09:43.680]  we have just seen hundreds of tweets with people saying that they are going
[02:09:43.680 --> 02:09:51.160]  to loot we reported on that on Monday the Atlantic magazine and others said
[02:09:51.160 --> 02:09:54.160]  there'll there will be no looting we were conspiracy theorists there was there

[02:10:10.840 --> 02:10:13.680]  obviously some of the stuff we link to is going to be real some won't the point
[02:10:13.680 --> 02:10:17.120]  is the looting is going on some people joke about looting some of them are

[02:11:34.280 --> 02:11:38.840]  Hicks who has been nice enough to drive to Austin he was already driving back
[02:11:38.840 --> 02:11:42.800]  through since he got back to the continental lower 48 from Hawaii where he
[02:11:42.800 --> 02:11:47.600]  was stranded for six days trying to go visit his wife is in the military and
[02:11:47.600 --> 02:11:53.040]  Wade Hicks is a defense contractor I'll let him break down his bio short and
[02:11:53.040 --> 02:11:57.720]  sweet for you but you know as he pointed out to our crew he's got one of the
[02:11:57.720 --> 02:12:01.760]  little transportation cards the highest level where you can go into nuclear
[02:12:01.760 --> 02:12:08.040]  power plants he can go anywhere so but but but here is the TSA and customs in
[02:12:08.040 --> 02:12:13.040]  Hawaii when he's about to go visit his wife in was it Okinawa and they said you
[02:12:13.040 --> 02:12:16.520]  can't fly so we're gonna break down what happened to him we first heard about
[02:12:16.520 --> 02:12:19.640]  this from the Northeast Intelligence Network and then days after we
[02:12:19.640 --> 02:12:23.320]  interviewed Wade Hicks I ended up being in the Associated Press you name it
[02:12:23.320 --> 02:12:29.400]  here's ABC News no-fly list trans man on island in Hawaii US citizen says he's
[02:12:29.400 --> 02:12:33.160]  stranded Hawaii by no-fly list because of his controversial views which is
[02:12:33.160 --> 02:12:38.800]  prepping NDAA critics stranded in Hawaii returning up on no-fly list I mean
[02:12:38.800 --> 02:12:44.000]  they had one of the top cricket players in the world and and he lives in England
[02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:49.160]  most the time very admired pro-western he criticized drone strikes he's probably
[02:12:49.160 --> 02:12:52.600]  about to be the next Pakistani president they pulled him off a flight in the US
[02:12:52.600 --> 02:12:57.160]  and said why don't you like the drones I mean it's the new political officers the
[02:12:57.160 --> 02:13:03.120]  commas are like the Soviets had in your face so here are all of those articles
[02:13:03.120 --> 02:13:07.200]  this is the new system where there's a checkpoint they run your data and you
[02:13:07.200 --> 02:13:12.160]  just disappear that's what's coming next under the NDAA so he criticizes the
[02:13:12.160 --> 02:13:16.000]  NDAA is put on a no-fly list because the NDAA says they can just disappear you
[02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:20.120]  well now they're doing the first stage of that like the Nazis at the train
[02:13:20.120 --> 02:13:25.640]  station checking papers but now it is biometric Wade Hicks again thank you for
[02:13:25.640 --> 02:13:29.760]  taking a route through Texas on your way back to Louisiana tell us about
[02:13:29.760 --> 02:13:33.520]  yourself take your time tell us blow by blow what happened to you what they
[02:13:33.520 --> 02:13:39.720]  told you what you went through and and and why you think you were put on that
[02:13:39.720 --> 02:13:43.200]  list outside of just the fact that they thought you were controversial well
[02:13:43.200 --> 02:13:46.160]  thanks for having me Alex a little professional background about myself
[02:13:46.160 --> 02:13:53.280]  I'm 34 years old I worked as a civilian contractor for a private company that
[02:13:53.280 --> 02:13:56.880]  had a government contract through military seal of command and I worked
[02:13:56.880 --> 02:14:00.800]  with their special missions program for approximately five years I've held
[02:14:00.800 --> 02:14:06.120]  numerous different variations of security clearances I have a
[02:14:06.120 --> 02:14:10.240]  transportation worker identification credential that's issued by the TSA just
[02:14:10.240 --> 02:14:14.520]  recently not even a month ago now I got a Mississippi enhanced concealed carry
[02:14:14.520 --> 02:14:17.640]  permit so I can carry a firearm concealed in a government building in the
[02:14:17.640 --> 02:14:22.080]  state of Mississippi to get that requires a pretty intensive background
[02:14:22.080 --> 02:14:26.640]  investigation by the FBI had I been under any sort of investigation or
[02:14:26.640 --> 02:14:32.040]  indictment for anything they would never issued that permit so it's really weird
[02:14:32.040 --> 02:14:39.400]  how I could possibly get on a no fly list and while I was over there in Hawaii
[02:14:39.400 --> 02:14:45.000]  I'd received a phone call from a deploy a service members spouse offering
[02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.840]  assistance if I needed a place to stay which I was really grateful for but I
[02:14:47.840 --> 02:14:51.520]  didn't want to really get anybody else involved in a situation because I didn't
[02:14:51.520 --> 02:14:54.760]  know how far they were gonna go with this and in your own expense you were
[02:14:54.760 --> 02:15:00.160]  there for six days right yes five days five days yeah I'm associated press at
[02:15:00.160 --> 02:15:08.040]  six that's why I said six it started for five six days yeah I landed Sunday flew
[02:15:08.040 --> 02:15:12.440]  military flight out of Travis Air Force Base landed in Hawaii on a connecting
[02:15:12.440 --> 02:15:19.160]  flight and on that connecting flight we had to stop and get off the airplane they
[02:15:19.160 --> 02:15:24.080]  took all of our gear and stuff off and we had to go out and go back get another
[02:15:24.080 --> 02:15:27.800]  ticket go back through security and when we went back through security the
[02:15:27.800 --> 02:15:34.200]  second time everything went just as it did the first time perfectly normal after
[02:15:34.200 --> 02:15:40.160]  that happened sitting in the secured area of the airport waiting and one of
[02:15:40.160 --> 02:15:44.600]  the workers at the air mobility command terminal which is active duty Air Force
[02:15:44.600 --> 02:15:50.040]  came up to me and said sir you need to come with us and it was I went with him
[02:15:50.040 --> 02:15:54.000]  we went over back by customs said that customs had an issue that needed to be
[02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:58.440]  resolved before I would be allowed to continue on my flight I jokingly said
[02:15:58.440 --> 02:16:01.080]  well you know I was already checked when I came into California I didn't bring
[02:16:01.080 --> 02:16:04.720]  any fruits or vegetables with me on the flight and I guess Hawaii is really
[02:16:04.720 --> 02:16:09.200]  strict about that as well but there was no one there with customs the office was
[02:16:09.200 --> 02:16:14.000]  locked the lights were off doors were closed it was it was just like they're
[02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:17.840]  excuse confused about situation as I was so I went and hung out in the break
[02:16:17.840 --> 02:16:23.120]  room that the Air Force enlisted personnel take their breaks in and I was
[02:16:23.120 --> 02:16:27.440]  there 15 20 minutes then all of a sudden two guys show up with the Air Force
[02:16:27.440 --> 02:16:31.400]  security forces and they're like the rapid response team so they're armed
[02:16:31.400 --> 02:16:35.440]  with M4s and grenade launchers and they show up and I'm like hey you guys here
[02:16:35.440 --> 02:16:39.480]  for me like are you Wade Hicks I said yeah that's me he says yeah we're here
[02:16:39.480 --> 02:16:42.640]  for you I said well let's get this out of the way you know if you want to search
[02:16:42.640 --> 02:16:47.480]  me I'm unarmed I don't have any anything that's dangerous to you or myself so if
[02:16:47.480 --> 02:16:51.040]  y'all want to search me let's get this out of the way let's get it done I want
[02:16:51.040 --> 02:16:54.480]  you to know that I'm not a threat and they're like oh that won't be necessary
[02:16:54.480 --> 02:16:58.240]  we just got told to come stand by so that and they do that all the time now the
[02:16:58.240 --> 02:17:01.880]  old ladies congressmen have been put on the no fly list and it's just getting
[02:17:01.880 --> 02:17:05.120]  everybody ready to disappear you them that's what this is they just put you on
[02:17:05.120 --> 02:17:09.080]  a list and you can't own guns anymore can't have a job you just disappear well
[02:17:09.080 --> 02:17:12.120]  it's like a beta test it they're doing it to see what they can get away with
[02:17:12.120 --> 02:17:16.320]  and what they can't get away with and evidently because my story went viral on
[02:17:16.320 --> 02:17:20.480]  the internet thanks to some friends that you know knew the guys over at the
[02:17:20.480 --> 02:17:24.680]  homeland security dot US website you know they got got my story out because I
[02:17:24.680 --> 02:17:28.240]  was I was really scared yeah that's Doug Hagman was first gave a test and we
[02:17:28.240 --> 02:17:31.960]  were able to break it thanks to him I was I was in the situation looking at it
[02:17:31.960 --> 02:17:36.040]  going you know all right I'm here in Hawaii I'm not being detained they told
[02:17:36.040 --> 02:17:40.800]  me I could go I just couldn't get on an airplane so I'm really concerned about
[02:17:40.800 --> 02:17:44.640]  my safety at that point because you know it's really easy to get ran over by a
[02:17:44.640 --> 02:17:47.520]  car walking through a crosswalk or something like that and oh well it was
[02:17:47.520 --> 02:17:51.840]  an accident so I was really watching my back the whole time I was over there and
[02:17:51.840 --> 02:17:55.360]  I I really avoided traveling it's renting cars or anything like that while I
[02:17:55.360 --> 02:18:01.240]  was there now again get into why this happened well back when they passed a
[02:18:01.240 --> 02:18:05.040]  national defense authorization act 2012 they had the indefinite detention
[02:18:05.040 --> 02:18:10.360]  provision in that act and I read it I was very disturbed by what it said because
[02:18:10.360 --> 02:18:15.000]  it basically says that the US military can if they choose to do so indefinitely
[02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:19.040]  detain a US citizen against their will without any due process and no one even
[02:18:19.040 --> 02:18:22.400]  know you disappeared no and that that's the thing it's a it's the thing of take
[02:18:22.400 --> 02:18:25.640]  him away to the dungeon I mean it's the essence of tyranny yeah well they're
[02:18:25.640 --> 02:18:28.600]  saying well you're a threat because we said so there's no due process or
[02:18:28.600 --> 02:18:31.640]  nothing else I mean we've already had one incident where they've killed an
[02:18:31.640 --> 02:18:34.520]  American citizen overseas just because he was alleged to be a threat and they're
[02:18:34.520 --> 02:18:38.640]  and they're setting the precedent continue yeah and that that's what I was
[02:18:38.640 --> 02:18:42.640]  scared of you know well now I'm on the no fly list okay how am I gonna get home
[02:18:42.640 --> 02:18:47.560]  and I asked the special agent with customs how am I gonna get home I don't
[02:18:47.560 --> 02:18:52.360]  know that's her responsible I don't know but you can't fly well there's no way
[02:18:52.360 --> 02:18:56.200]  to get off this island unless I either and now the IRS is saying we don't care
[02:18:56.200 --> 02:18:59.680]  of Congress doesn't pass the law if we say you owe money they're gonna not let
[02:18:59.680 --> 02:19:04.200]  you leave the US and now they're not let people take legal money out money that's
[02:19:04.200 --> 02:19:07.280]  after taxes people are trying to move to Switzerland they're telling them no you
[02:19:07.280 --> 02:19:10.680]  can't they're locked in the country down they're definitely doing something
[02:19:10.680 --> 02:19:15.720]  behind the scenes because I got to see it firsthand and the special agents look
[02:19:15.720 --> 02:19:19.960]  at her face when we were doing the the whole it there wasn't even really an
[02:19:19.960 --> 02:19:23.080]  interview process or anything she was confused about the situation as much as
[02:19:23.080 --> 02:19:29.120]  I was she says well do you have any idea why you would be on the no fly list no
[02:19:29.120 --> 02:19:32.200]  they always act like that it's all part of their joke we're gonna go to break I
[02:19:32.200 --> 02:19:35.120]  want to come back and have you continue what happened and then what happened
[02:19:35.120 --> 02:19:38.840]  once they you know took you off of it and you know getting into the behind the
[02:19:38.840 --> 02:19:45.080]  scenes of this new system where they want to persecute people for their mild
[02:19:45.080 --> 02:19:49.320]  political speech is a chilling effect I mean this is the long dark winter that
[02:19:49.320 --> 02:19:53.240]  Alexander Solzhenitsyn talked about if we give in to this intimidation they
[02:19:53.240 --> 02:19:59.160]  win they take over these are criminal tyrants we'll be right back

[02:24:13.440 --> 02:24:18.320]  extra judicially the former White House Chief of Staff from a manual now
[02:24:18.320 --> 02:24:23.680]  Chicago boss he I've got the video clubs we can play him we've played him
[02:24:23.680 --> 02:24:26.600]  before where he said hey we're gonna put you on a fly list then we're gonna take
[02:24:26.600 --> 02:24:30.720]  your guns no judge no jury and I remember seeing TSA ten years ago so you're
[02:24:30.720 --> 02:24:34.040]  gonna get a card to have a job anywhere so they started with quote critical
[02:24:34.040 --> 02:24:39.440]  infrastructure you have one of those cards now they're expanding it but here
[02:24:39.440 --> 02:24:42.520]  you are flying to Hawaii to fly to Okinawa to see your wife is in the
[02:24:42.520 --> 02:24:45.200]  military you've been a defense contractor you got all the security
[02:24:45.200 --> 02:24:50.160]  clearances and now you're sitting there and so what do they tell you just at
[02:24:50.160 --> 02:24:54.080]  your own expense now you're stranded bye-bye I mean go back and finish that
[02:24:54.080 --> 02:24:58.920]  part of the story well they the special agent told me that I was not permitted
[02:24:58.920 --> 02:25:03.480]  to fly I was not being detained and I asked her I said well don't you think
[02:25:03.480 --> 02:25:06.800]  there's something wrong with this man under the Constitution I don't know if
[02:25:06.800 --> 02:25:09.560]  you sworn oath to it but I'm pretty sure the rest of these guys here that are in
[02:25:09.560 --> 02:25:12.800]  the Air Force and you know even that DoD police officer probably sworn oath at
[02:25:12.800 --> 02:25:16.640]  one point in time that a Constitution I said now I'm being deprived of my right
[02:25:16.640 --> 02:25:22.080]  to do process how can you sleep at night when you do things like that yeah
[02:25:22.080 --> 02:25:26.040]  they're militarily seizing transportation and outside of law are any
[02:25:26.040 --> 02:25:29.600]  authority just saying you can't I'm sorry go ahead well the military has a
[02:25:29.600 --> 02:25:34.320]  huge problem with that because DHS and the US military are separate what
[02:25:34.320 --> 02:25:37.680]  business does Homeland Security have to tell the military how to operate their
[02:25:37.680 --> 02:25:42.040]  aircraft exactly you've got military clearance they're flying you out to see
[02:25:42.040 --> 02:25:45.000]  your wife which is part of the program people you know there's room on the
[02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:49.520]  flights but but I'm sorry I'm interrupting so you say well this is the
[02:25:49.520 --> 02:25:53.320]  Constitution what the Constitution guarantees right to do process which I
[02:25:53.320 --> 02:25:58.160]  was deprived of and what did she say she says well I'm sorry I said well you
[02:25:58.160 --> 02:26:03.480]  know not as sorry as I am because this country is just going downhill and if
[02:26:03.480 --> 02:26:07.160]  you're not willing to make a stand and say this is not right I mean I guess no
[02:26:07.160 --> 02:26:11.080]  one is your well that's why we're here all these people will do whatever they're
[02:26:11.080 --> 02:26:15.880]  told the Nuremberg defense of just following all dives yeah well that
[02:26:15.880 --> 02:26:20.440]  that's the problem that they're just following orders and I told I made it
[02:26:20.440 --> 02:26:23.680]  clear to the guys with the guns in the Air Force I said look I understand you
[02:26:23.680 --> 02:26:27.040]  guys don't want to hurt me but you're just following orders I understand how
[02:26:27.040 --> 02:26:29.600]  that works you're worried about your careers and things like that you can't
[02:26:29.600 --> 02:26:34.040]  let me go because they'll they'll court martial you if you do of course they
[02:26:34.040 --> 02:26:36.480]  wouldn't let me get on a plane anyway so it was kind of pointless you've got to
[02:26:36.480 --> 02:26:40.960]  ask him how far will you go following orders I've asked active duty military
[02:26:40.960 --> 02:26:45.160]  how far they would go and they they have their lines in the sand yeah but the
[02:26:45.160 --> 02:26:49.000]  system has a way of moving that line down the road so so so finishing up
[02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:53.120]  why did they put you on the list well that's what I I haven't found I haven't
[02:26:53.120 --> 02:26:55.720]  found any reason why they would put me on the list the only thing is what I can
[02:26:55.720 --> 02:26:58.800]  assume is I'm outspoken about the National Defense Authorization Act I've
[02:26:58.800 --> 02:27:02.680]  contacted my members of Congress an American contact of the representative
[02:27:02.680 --> 02:27:07.040]  who that's really bad yeah evidently wow that's a evil evidently I guess my
[02:27:07.040 --> 02:27:11.400]  view to viewpoint represents 13,000 people I guess is this statistic that
[02:27:11.400 --> 02:27:16.040]  well I mean even even even knowing how to contact a representative is bad well
[02:27:16.040 --> 02:27:20.120]  then they must really love me because I contacted five senators and two
[02:27:20.120 --> 02:27:24.560]  representatives oh so on America in the contact representative wow what's next
[02:27:24.560 --> 02:27:29.480]  you might actually have a free speech but well that that's it I mean not only
[02:27:29.480 --> 02:27:33.000]  are they depriving me of of due process they're infringing on my first
[02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:35.840]  amendment right if that is indeed the reason they put well we've interviewed
[02:27:35.840 --> 02:27:38.880]  Marines and others who they want to become infiltrators guys they know a
[02:27:38.880 --> 02:27:42.600]  really gung-ho and have a great record they put really good guys on a no fly
[02:27:42.600 --> 02:27:46.840]  list who they actuary out and profile that are business guys have got to fly
[02:27:46.840 --> 02:27:50.600]  who are making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year a professional who can
[02:27:50.600 --> 02:27:54.640]  manage that's who they want and they and and for six months you can't fly and
[02:27:54.640 --> 02:27:58.480]  then the FBI shows them goes come with us to a hotel you're gonna get your
[02:27:58.480 --> 02:28:02.080]  your capacity for your job back and we're gonna pay you we want you to
[02:28:02.080 --> 02:28:05.600]  infiltrate groups and work for us now and we put you on that list so you'd
[02:28:05.600 --> 02:28:10.560]  submit to us I mean what that's how they make you an agent a minion is they
[02:28:10.560 --> 02:28:13.880]  destroy your life for no reason and they go out and find hard-working really
[02:28:13.880 --> 02:28:17.840]  smart guys that they think will be good slaves yeah well it's not gonna work
[02:28:17.840 --> 02:28:20.600]  with me they're gonna have to kill me first well I think that's probably what
[02:28:20.600 --> 02:28:24.280]  it was it might not even be that you criticize the NDA they probably want
[02:28:24.280 --> 02:28:27.440]  you because you have a patriot background to infiltrate if I had to guess
[02:28:27.440 --> 02:28:30.480]  they want you as an infiltrator and they were gonna put you on this list for
[02:28:30.480 --> 02:28:35.000]  the next six months till you I mean do you need to fly as part of your job no
[02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:38.800]  well then that might not be it I don't contract anymore I'm out of that line of
[02:28:38.800 --> 02:28:43.120]  work I'm partially disabled because I blew my knee out so I'm pretty much
[02:28:43.120 --> 02:28:47.320]  going back to school for history and then I want to focus on constitutional law
[02:28:47.320 --> 02:28:50.520]  well that's probably just because you criticized them then also was there
[02:28:50.520 --> 02:28:54.040]  ever any prepper meetings you went to yeah yeah I was a point of contact for
[02:28:54.040 --> 02:28:56.720]  the Mississippi preparedness project for over two years and then what's the rest
[02:28:56.720 --> 02:28:59.520]  of that story didn't you guys like think you had a mole in there or something I
[02:28:59.520 --> 02:29:03.920]  was we had a guy that came in to the organization came over to my house and
[02:29:03.920 --> 02:29:07.600]  I have a meet-and-greet with everybody to kind of get a generalized feel for them
[02:29:07.600 --> 02:29:11.480]  and see where their heart is you know if their heart minds with prepping and
[02:29:11.480 --> 02:29:14.640]  with the Constitution and with freedom and liberty you know we welcome a man
[02:29:14.640 --> 02:29:18.920]  basically evil yeah yeah if we don't we don't care what political persuasion
[02:29:18.920 --> 02:29:23.240]  they are Democrat Republican independent doesn't matter but this guy came in and
[02:29:23.240 --> 02:29:27.160]  he had a really fantastic story about how he was a Navy SEAL and yeah they

[02:31:04.840 --> 02:31:09.320]  farmers Americans are losing access not just a raw milk and homemade cheeses but
[02:31:09.320 --> 02:31:12.880]  to healthy home crafted sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut yogurt
[02:31:12.880 --> 02:31:16.440]  and kefir it seems there's a war on life-giving foods with living enzymes
[02:31:16.440 --> 02:31:20.000]  and healthy bacteria but frankly I'm not sure what the food police are so afraid
[02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:23.040]  of these remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history

[02:31:30.080 --> 02:31:34.480]  Africans eat fermented porges Koreans eat kamichi and in India fermented milk
[02:31:34.480 --> 02:31:37.840]  is a staple for healthy living but here's some good news self-reliant

[02:33:32.440 --> 02:33:43.960]  at him let me at him right and wrong a new world learner now Wade Hicks is not
[02:33:43.960 --> 02:33:48.600]  only an evil defense contractor with a national security clearance he's been a
[02:33:48.600 --> 02:33:51.640]  listener of this show for five years all right I want to go to some phone calls
[02:33:51.640 --> 02:33:54.360]  here but I've been interjecting a lot you're gonna be on the nightly news
[02:33:54.360 --> 02:34:01.200]  tonight with our own reporters here and we're gonna have David I interview you
[02:34:01.200 --> 02:34:05.720]  who was good enough to dig through all the contacts and find out that I believe
[02:34:05.720 --> 02:34:09.920]  you'd contacted us but the point is is that it's good to have you here we can't
[02:34:09.920 --> 02:34:14.920]  give into this intimidation we're gonna lose everything again Wade Hicks was
[02:34:14.920 --> 02:34:19.840]  put on a no-fly list and stranded for almost six days in Hawaii while
[02:34:19.840 --> 02:34:23.560]  traveling from the continental United States to Hawaii in a layover to go
[02:34:23.560 --> 02:34:28.880]  visit his wife who's in the military in Okinawa and he was on a military flight
[02:34:28.880 --> 02:34:33.200]  they do that with the spouses when they have the room it's a good program and
[02:34:33.200 --> 02:34:36.880]  the military didn't particularly like the fact that DHS is there in control of
[02:34:36.880 --> 02:34:40.520]  everything when they already cleared somebody to be flying so I mean how did
[02:34:40.520 --> 02:34:43.400]  they act because I want to go back to the guy that infiltrated your public
[02:34:43.400 --> 02:34:46.800]  group that but they infiltrate acting like you're doing something wrong be
[02:34:46.800 --> 02:34:50.360]  like infiltrating the Salvation Army you know your prepping group and I think
[02:34:50.360 --> 02:34:53.000]  that's probably what got you on the list but what did they say when they just
[02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:57.320]  said you're okay leave now you know just go go live on the streets of Hawaii for
[02:34:57.320 --> 02:35:00.120]  the rest of your life I mean this is gonna become a new phenomenon where
[02:35:00.120 --> 02:35:04.160]  we're just wandering around stuck wherever we're at because God government
[02:35:04.160 --> 02:35:09.920]  said so well you know I was pretty much stranded there for weeks so I called the
[02:35:09.920 --> 02:35:13.680]  special agent the next morning to find out if I was gonna be able to have an
[02:35:13.680 --> 02:35:17.960]  interview with the FBI and get get my name cleared so I can continue on my
[02:35:17.960 --> 02:35:23.440]  journey and she's like well we're working on a remedy it's gonna take
[02:35:23.440 --> 02:35:27.080]  some time there's a lot of paperwork that has to be generated I said well I'll
[02:35:27.080 --> 02:35:29.720]  give you a week and then I'm gonna get off the side and they won't tell you how
[02:35:29.720 --> 02:35:34.100]  you get on it no that's the thing they probably put you on it well I have a
[02:35:34.100 --> 02:35:38.440]  relative that is in the FBI I called him personally and said hey look should I
[02:35:38.440 --> 02:35:41.960]  go turn myself in do they have something on me where I I should turn myself in
[02:35:41.960 --> 02:35:47.440]  and find you know have my due process and and get cleared because this is
[02:35:47.440 --> 02:35:50.760]  crazy and no no that's the essence of it there is nothing go ahead well he said
[02:35:50.760 --> 02:35:53.960]  basically he says well were you affiliated with any type of a patriot
[02:35:53.960 --> 02:35:56.520]  groups or anything like that I said well yeah I says well that's probably what
[02:35:56.520 --> 02:36:00.800]  got you put on the list and and he thinks that's good if you're aware of the
[02:36:00.800 --> 02:36:04.320]  takeover which is public I can play clip saying we're now been taken over by
[02:36:04.320 --> 02:36:08.220]  foreign banks you you should now have your rights taken for committing no
[02:36:08.220 --> 02:36:11.460]  crime well I can't allude to what his personal thoughts are on it I did I
[02:36:11.460 --> 02:36:14.400]  didn't ask him because he was at work and of course yeah lines are tapped as
[02:36:14.400 --> 02:36:21.800]  well um but I don't I don't think any true American likes this entire or deal
[02:36:21.800 --> 02:36:26.040]  it's outrageous it's it's crazy and you know if one thing could come out of this
[02:36:26.040 --> 02:36:31.240]  is that the situation that happened to me hopefully I can work with Congress and
[02:36:31.240 --> 02:36:35.040]  get things done so this never happens bro they put CNN reporters who've
[02:36:35.040 --> 02:36:39.880]  criticized the TSA mildly on the list they have the only they've done for your
[02:36:39.880 --> 02:36:44.120]  lawsuits because they got documents that my name and Matt Rudge's name they
[02:36:44.120 --> 02:36:47.160]  teach the TSA were terrorists that's been confirmed but they can't get the
[02:36:47.160 --> 02:36:50.600]  full documents but they teach them we're extremist and all this stuff Bob Bar
[02:36:50.600 --> 02:36:53.720]  suing him trying to get the full documents so they're just total creep
[02:36:53.720 --> 02:36:57.280]  azoids yes it's you're on the list because we said so that that's the
[02:36:57.280 --> 02:37:00.320]  entire thing there's no do they put Congress people on it I mean this is
[02:37:00.320 --> 02:37:05.280]  outrageous it's it's it's all politically motivated anyway so continue so
[02:37:05.280 --> 02:37:09.440]  anyway getting back to the guy that infiltrated our group or attempted to
[02:37:09.440 --> 02:37:13.800]  infiltrate them he came telling us fantastic story of how he was a Navy
[02:37:13.800 --> 02:37:17.200]  Seal he was with SEAL team 2 and he really didn't like it he tried to get
[02:37:17.200 --> 02:37:19.840]  transferred to another team but they do a lot of cold weather operations and
[02:37:19.840 --> 02:37:24.600]  everything and it just the story wasn't making sense because in in my
[02:37:24.600 --> 02:37:29.320]  contracting days I've actually been around vessels with Navy SEALs on them
[02:37:29.320 --> 02:37:31.760]  had conversations with them and they don't talk like that they don't talk
[02:37:31.760 --> 02:37:35.680]  about what they do I kind of joke around and say they're bipolar because when
[02:37:35.680 --> 02:37:38.880]  they have their game face on that's all they're doing is is the mission it's the
[02:37:38.880 --> 02:37:42.920]  most important thing and then in their personal lives are very quiet they you
[02:37:42.920 --> 02:37:48.680]  wouldn't know one if you ran into him on the street and his his mannerisms and
[02:37:48.680 --> 02:37:54.000]  his actions did not add up to someone that was of that caliber of individual he
[02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:58.320]  just he did not fit the profile in any way shape or form so as soon as he left
[02:37:58.320 --> 02:38:04.160]  the house I started digging made a call to JSOC over in California and requested
[02:38:04.160 --> 02:38:08.200]  a FOIA over the phone I got the results from the FOIA in less than a week and it
[02:38:08.200 --> 02:38:12.600]  said he'd never been in SEALs had undergone no SEAL training I then
[02:38:12.600 --> 02:38:16.440]  contacted someone that was in the Mississippi National Guard that was
[02:38:16.440 --> 02:38:20.920]  military police and I asked him hey can you check this guy out let me know yes
[02:38:20.920 --> 02:38:24.200]  or no is he in the military or was in the military because he did have a
[02:38:24.200 --> 02:38:28.720]  retired ID he ran a basic check just running his name and his date of birth
[02:38:28.720 --> 02:38:36.040]  information that was already had and nothing came up but this guy had retired
[02:38:36.040 --> 02:38:41.440]  military ID a DD-214 stating that he had SEAL time and so you blew one of their
[02:38:41.440 --> 02:38:46.480]  operatives it pretty much and then I just happened to be out in town and was
[02:38:46.480 --> 02:38:49.960]  driving down the road and I saw his truck with the tag that's not registered
[02:38:49.960 --> 02:38:54.920]  to him or that vehicle retired at Afghanistan veteran tag so I just kind
[02:38:54.920 --> 02:38:59.200]  of tailed him and he went to some federal building in downtown Gulfport so
[02:38:59.200 --> 02:39:03.360]  I was like well I guess the guy is a Fed yeah listen it's not just preppers or
[02:39:03.360 --> 02:39:09.040]  malicious I have tried to go fix a veterans house they were gonna bulldoze
[02:39:09.040 --> 02:39:12.960]  and they sent undercover feds and saying let's blow up the the federal
[02:39:12.960 --> 02:39:16.240]  courthouse and stuff and I followed them outside to those and it was like a
[02:39:16.240 --> 02:39:20.320]  unmarked police car I mean they're just they don't want any of us having any
[02:39:20.320 --> 02:39:24.680]  community they don't want Amish they don't want backyard barbecues they don't
[02:39:24.680 --> 02:39:29.720]  want people growing their own crops they want you to take the shots drink the
[02:39:29.720 --> 02:39:33.840]  fluoride and shut up their control freaks they're all about micromanaging and
[02:39:33.840 --> 02:39:38.960]  controlling every aspect of our daily lives and soon they realize I mean they
[02:39:38.960 --> 02:39:42.320]  have to realize if not they're they're stupider than I thought they have to
[02:39:42.320 --> 02:39:45.640]  realize that eventually their micromanaging of our our daily lives is
[02:39:45.640 --> 02:39:48.560]  gonna reach a boiling point and we're gonna start pushing back and we're not
[02:39:48.560 --> 02:39:51.960]  gonna push back in the protesting way we're gonna push back the way we did in
[02:39:51.960 --> 02:39:56.640]  1776 where we said enough's enough you stop or else well exactly and but
[02:39:56.640 --> 02:40:00.600]  that's another plan they want to start a civil war and and and that's their plan
[02:40:00.600 --> 02:40:04.760]  but you know whatever happens happens my issue is most police and military I
[02:40:04.760 --> 02:40:07.960]  talked to are finally waking up because it's gotten so cartoonishly
[02:40:07.960 --> 02:40:11.560]  ridiculous is that what you're finding yeah that that's what I'm hearing I mean
[02:40:11.560 --> 02:40:15.400]  a lot of people in the military have turned into preppers we had a lot of
[02:40:15.400 --> 02:40:19.160]  people in the preparedness project that are active duty military retired
[02:40:19.160 --> 02:40:23.160]  military national guard we even have law enforcement and law enforcement has
[02:40:23.160 --> 02:40:27.080]  been told don't belong to those preparedness groups so they don't
[02:40:27.080 --> 02:40:30.400]  really come to any they're scared to death all it is is like civil air
[02:40:30.400 --> 02:40:34.720]  patrol or civil defense that my dad was part of I was part of civil air patrol
[02:40:34.720 --> 02:40:38.080]  we used to view when I was a kid you know stern shine our boots and everything
[02:40:38.080 --> 02:40:42.720]  and fly around and you know report weather stuff and and they're just afraid
[02:40:42.720 --> 02:40:47.840]  of the idea of the people being the government like the sheriff's posse
[02:40:47.840 --> 02:40:53.520]  they're so scared of we the people working with good government because they
[02:40:53.520 --> 02:40:56.800]  don't want that they want centralized total federalization well that's the
[02:40:56.800 --> 02:41:00.600]  exact thing I mean the whole goal of the Mississippi preparedness project was to
[02:41:00.600 --> 02:41:04.120]  help individuals be prepared for any disaster whether man-made or natural in
[02:41:04.120 --> 02:41:09.920]  origin and we've basically taken ready.gov and put it on steroids where
[02:41:09.920 --> 02:41:12.480]  we're taking people and saying all right you need a lot more than three days
[02:41:12.480 --> 02:41:16.160]  worth of food well look at the hurricane well and and that's they're scared of
[02:41:16.160 --> 02:41:20.680]  people getting back like old-timers did to have an a root-seller full of stuff
[02:41:20.680 --> 02:41:24.080]  and no one out of skin a buck and run a trot line they want domesticated humans
[02:41:24.080 --> 02:41:27.560]  and this prepper movement is an anti-domestication they want it they want
[02:41:27.560 --> 02:41:30.960]  us dependent on them and and preppers are not dependent on anyone we're
[02:41:30.960 --> 02:41:33.680]  self-sufficient so what happened with this guy after you learned he was at the
[02:41:33.680 --> 02:41:38.880]  federal building we had kicked him out of the organization we basically sent him
[02:41:38.880 --> 02:41:42.200]  an email saying look you know we didn't tell him that that's why we removed him
[02:41:42.200 --> 02:41:45.720]  from the organization he attended one of our events with a bag that may or may
[02:41:45.720 --> 02:41:49.920]  not have a concealed weapon in it he had he did have a concealed carry permit
[02:41:49.920 --> 02:41:55.000]  but his actions with the bag immediately set set off my spider senses
[02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:58.560]  saying something's not right because he tried to hand the bag off not only to my
[02:41:58.560 --> 02:42:03.200]  wife but to another person it was active duty who was a Air Force EOD and of
[02:42:03.200 --> 02:42:07.360]  course oh yeah they will they want to create artificial terror grips and they
[02:42:07.360 --> 02:42:12.080]  will plant bombs on people that's that was my initial concern either this is a
[02:42:12.080 --> 02:42:15.360]  run well they'll put one in your car and detonate it and say you did it yeah
[02:42:15.360 --> 02:42:19.600]  well there there's actually I was sitting in the back and I through you know
[02:42:19.600 --> 02:42:24.800]  training that the government gave me I I was able to spot three people that were
[02:42:24.800 --> 02:42:31.120]  there that were watching everything that was going on and to the average person
[02:42:31.120 --> 02:42:33.760]  they wouldn't be able to see that but I was back there with a guy that was a
[02:42:33.760 --> 02:42:36.920]  military police and we're sitting there watching him point them out and when they
[02:42:36.920 --> 02:42:40.960]  noticed that we started noticing them they all left that's what's incredible is
[02:42:40.960 --> 02:42:44.880]  you try to keep a veteran's house from getting bulldozed they want to put you in
[02:42:44.880 --> 02:42:48.480]  jail it I mean they just don't want us doing anything pretty soon you'll get a
[02:42:48.480 --> 02:42:52.480]  recipe try to tie your own shoelaces it's it's it's getting there Alex and I
[02:42:52.480 --> 02:42:55.720]  tell you right now unless people start waking up and realizing like I want to
[02:42:55.720 --> 02:42:59.120]  put the call out to the military y'all need to wake up and get vocal about this
[02:42:59.120 --> 02:43:03.080]  because if this could happen to me my wife is in a military I was a contractor
[02:43:03.080 --> 02:43:06.280]  but even if I wasn't this could happen to your wife or your kids where they're
[02:43:06.280 --> 02:43:08.960]  they get put on the no-fly list and then they're stranded in somewhere
[02:43:08.960 --> 02:43:14.240]  probably not as nice as Hawaii and are they gonna be able to have the yeah but
[02:43:14.240 --> 02:43:17.160]  next it's gonna be not let you have a job not let you have a gun they've
[02:43:17.160 --> 02:43:22.560]  already said all this I have been flying out of Austin and they find six silver
[02:43:22.560 --> 02:43:25.720]  coins on a guy who was a computer software developer turned out he was
[02:43:25.720 --> 02:43:30.400]  like a rich guy and and he was going to a coin expo in Las Vegas one of these
[02:43:30.400 --> 02:43:33.240]  guys and it was just regular silver coins you know a little kid with his
[02:43:33.240 --> 02:43:36.480]  coins but you can't have honest money and they got in his face yelled at him
[02:43:36.480 --> 02:43:40.320]  almost took it but but let him have it but he said they told him of you had a
[02:43:40.320 --> 02:43:43.880]  few more way to take him and now they have all these TV shows coming out
[02:43:43.880 --> 02:43:48.320]  where the military infiltrates prepper groups they have a new show coming out
[02:43:48.320 --> 02:43:52.080]  called founding fathers where it demonizes the founders it's based in Texas
[02:43:52.080 --> 02:43:56.280]  says you know patriots are bad I mean it's just great they're getting ready
[02:43:56.280 --> 02:43:58.680]  for this what they're doing is they're using the propaganda known as the
[02:43:58.680 --> 02:44:02.400]  mainstream media to basically program people like we have that TV show
[02:44:02.400 --> 02:44:06.480]  revolution where the militias bad they're they're trying they're they're
[02:44:06.480 --> 02:44:09.600]  trying to program the psyche of the Americans that will listen to their
[02:44:09.600 --> 02:44:14.400]  propaganda and absorb it just like the the Germans in World War two to just
[02:44:14.400 --> 02:44:17.960]  blindly fault follow the matter there's no doubt the people running the
[02:44:17.960 --> 02:44:21.560]  government are super bad and it's a lot higher than Obama and they were I mean
[02:44:21.560 --> 02:44:25.720]  I've got FEMA training video people can look it up just look up FEMA teaches
[02:44:25.720 --> 02:44:29.840]  founding fathers bad and they sit there and trash the police George Washington
[02:44:29.840 --> 02:44:33.680]  Thomas Jefferson and then now it's in the manuals I mean obviously these are
[02:44:33.680 --> 02:44:37.720]  the bad guys I mean look they say the founders of our country are bad yeah
[02:44:37.720 --> 02:44:41.640]  because everybody knows if you read what they said I saw articles last year
[02:44:41.640 --> 02:44:45.240]  earlier this year saying the Declaration of Independence was terrorist yeah
[02:44:45.240 --> 02:44:48.280]  well they did they they have attorneys that debate that every year whether it
[02:44:48.280 --> 02:44:51.600]  was terrorism or whether it's freedom but that's that's where we're going in
[02:44:51.600 --> 02:44:55.840]  this country you know we celebrate the 4th of July every year and people think
[02:44:55.840 --> 02:44:59.120]  it's it's about barbecuing and fireworks they don't really understand what was
[02:44:59.120 --> 02:45:02.200]  going on in those people's minds when they signed that document they didn't
[02:45:02.200 --> 02:45:05.520]  go sign the document have some grand ceremony they signed that document in
[02:45:05.520 --> 02:45:08.680]  secret because they knew if they got caught all there together they were all
[02:45:08.680 --> 02:45:11.540]  gonna get killed and they said you know we're gonna hang together we're gonna
[02:45:11.540 --> 02:45:14.680]  hang separate well that's right and they went out and took action well let me
[02:45:14.680 --> 02:45:18.160]  I mean if you look at what happened there the biggest thing it was over was
[02:45:18.160 --> 02:45:21.440]  when they came to take the guns just like the Texas Revolution started when
[02:45:21.440 --> 02:45:24.320]  they came to take the guns you know come and take it in Gonzales Texas the
[02:45:24.320 --> 02:45:27.640]  media spends what that was really about but it finally happened at Lexington
[02:45:27.640 --> 02:45:32.280]  Concord but the build-up was if you weren't an insider with the government
[02:45:32.280 --> 02:45:36.920]  and the crown you couldn't own property you couldn't get a job it everything
[02:45:36.920 --> 02:45:41.200]  was controlled by monopolies and people were sick of it including George
[02:45:41.200 --> 02:45:45.560]  Washington I mean you had to buy your clothes from England they had laws you
[02:45:45.560 --> 02:45:49.040]  couldn't manufacture them here you had to buy your guns from England you had to
[02:45:49.040 --> 02:45:53.920]  you couldn't have finished goods it was all meant to keep us down and it's the
[02:45:53.920 --> 02:45:58.640]  same that's what globalism is it exactly and and that's that's where we're
[02:45:58.640 --> 02:46:04.080]  headed I mean I played the George Bush 1991 New World Order speech from my in
[02:46:04.080 --> 02:46:09.040]  laws who are about as liberal as you can get and they were like well what does
[02:46:09.040 --> 02:46:12.000]  that mean and they're say what's all the neocons you don't you got to realize
[02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:15.160]  this that there's two sides to every coin you flip the coin it doesn't matter
[02:46:15.160 --> 02:46:19.040]  what side the coin lands on it's gonna be bad either way it's a coin it's a coin
[02:46:19.040 --> 02:46:25.160]  it it's two sides of the same evil coin oh man I tell you let's take some phone
[02:46:25.160 --> 02:46:29.480]  calls so well I mean where are you going now on this I mean you talked about
[02:46:29.480 --> 02:46:34.240]  Congress we need to get the Congress people and reporters together and have
[02:46:34.240 --> 02:46:38.960]  lawsuits about this but more than this it's just this convicts the system that
[02:46:38.960 --> 02:46:41.720]  they're doing this this is the proof they're a bunch of out of control
[02:46:41.720 --> 02:46:45.520]  tyrants and the TSA is caught some of them stealing a million dollars a piece
[02:46:45.520 --> 02:46:50.000]  a year out of bags raping people beating them up stripping down naked and
[02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:54.320]  announcing they're God and I have power I mean these are just crazy people the
[02:46:54.320 --> 02:46:56.840]  reason TSA can get away with all that is because they're not sworn law
[02:46:56.840 --> 02:46:59.600]  enforcement they're just people they hire off the street and say here's a
[02:46:59.600 --> 02:47:03.360]  uniform here's a job it's no different than a private security officer a private
[02:47:03.360 --> 02:47:06.320]  security officer that works security of the bank can't put his hands on you
[02:47:06.320 --> 02:47:11.320]  unless you touch him first and TSA is like the purple cow the whole situation
[02:47:11.320 --> 02:47:14.080]  because they're not sworn law enforcement they don't have to follow the
[02:47:14.080 --> 02:47:18.280]  Constitution they don't have a note that they saw but then they they do 20 times
[02:47:18.280 --> 02:47:22.840]  what cops do it it's like it's like they have no it's all fraud well I'll tell
[02:47:22.840 --> 02:47:26.040]  you a little quick story when my wife went to fly out just to see if I was
[02:47:26.040 --> 02:47:28.960]  still in a no-fly list I went and got a gate tried to get a gate pass which
[02:47:28.960 --> 02:47:32.320]  surprisingly I did get the gate pass so I went with her to the gate I
[02:47:32.320 --> 02:47:36.320]  intentionally left my wallet in my back pocket to see if the naked body scanner
[02:47:36.320 --> 02:47:40.760]  would detect it it did so the result of it detecting my wallet my back pocket
[02:47:40.760 --> 02:47:44.440]  was they had to swab my hands down with that little pad to check for explosives
[02:47:44.440 --> 02:47:48.320]  and when I opened my wallet up and they saw my concealed carry permit the idiot
[02:47:48.320 --> 02:47:51.840]  TSA agent says you don't have a gun on you right now do you and I just looked
[02:47:51.840 --> 02:47:54.280]  him right in the eyes and said you know what you're an idiot
[02:47:54.280 --> 02:47:57.520]  you just gone through a scanner went through a scanner you found my wallet I
[02:47:57.520 --> 02:48:02.320]  obviously don't have a firearm on me you're an idiot and he just kind of like
[02:48:02.320 --> 02:48:07.160]  looked at me and says go ahead he's he was just shocked that I would speak well
[02:48:07.160 --> 02:48:10.600]  I gotta say they are I don't even call them liberals domesticated chicken
[02:48:10.600 --> 02:48:15.000]  eggs most the TSA we run into are like commies I mean and they're scared of
[02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:19.360]  guns everything they're just idiots they really I mean just the permit scared
[02:48:19.360 --> 02:48:22.960]  him he was worried about the problem you don't have a gun on you now do you it's
[02:48:22.960 --> 02:48:27.160]  like are you serious you're it's it's it's to the point now that they're
[02:48:27.160 --> 02:48:30.920]  teaching the guns are bad because only criminals have guns but if you look at
[02:48:30.920 --> 02:48:34.840]  every single situation that we've had there's been armed robberies where
[02:48:34.840 --> 02:48:37.840]  there's been someone had a that had a gun and stopped the armed robbery but they
[02:48:37.840 --> 02:48:41.480]  don't want they don't want that they don't publicize that Sebastian in Oregon
[02:48:41.480 --> 02:48:46.120]  you're on the air with the evil thought criminal Wade Hicks go ahead hey I don't
[02:48:46.120 --> 02:48:49.880]  miss Alex Jones my friend first time from first time caller listen to you for
[02:48:49.880 --> 02:48:55.240]  two years now just every excellent information I've been working up since
[02:48:55.240 --> 02:49:01.640]  9-11 kind of victimized from that we're from New York Long Island
[02:49:01.640 --> 02:49:08.360]  that's a county I'm kind of continued pray for my friends up there and family
[02:49:08.360 --> 02:49:12.320]  and it's just it's horrible because it's like it's taking biggest event that has
[02:49:12.320 --> 02:49:17.280]  taken place over there in New York and well people never expect disasters to
[02:49:17.280 --> 02:49:20.760]  hit them but the truth is everybody gets hit by disasters a few times in their
[02:49:20.760 --> 02:49:25.480]  life sometimes more but then go ahead no no no for sure and I got to continue
[02:49:25.480 --> 02:49:28.840]  sorry no no go ahead so what's on your mind today
[02:49:28.840 --> 02:49:34.240]  it's just I'm fed up it's just a lot of things I mean my family my brothers I
[02:49:34.240 --> 02:49:38.080]  got my family and my mother in Ohio and just they're getting they're always
[02:49:38.080 --> 02:49:40.560]  getting you know and just it's just you know
[02:49:40.560 --> 02:49:45.000]  Long Island New York is very people are very resilient out there but you know it's
[02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:48.240]  like now they have to be on the tippy toes and it's just like this is a big one
[02:49:48.240 --> 02:49:52.400]  that's kind of like waking them up for the second time again now and it's just
[02:49:52.400 --> 02:49:56.720]  it's dangerous and it's scary when you actually have these bootings and people
[02:49:56.720 --> 02:50:02.160]  you know I'm just kind of what's amazing is the looting is admitted and
[02:50:02.160 --> 02:50:05.400]  they've got more articles out saying we're bad to report on it it's just
[02:50:05.400 --> 02:50:09.600]  really weird how the mainstream media loves to try to set the agenda like
[02:50:09.600 --> 02:50:13.840]  they're God even though they implode more and more every day
[02:50:13.840 --> 02:50:18.920]  it's a moral it's a more than wrong to actually you know you know Mr. Hicks
[02:50:18.920 --> 02:50:23.040]  comment from Mr. Hicks basically it's intrusive it's invasive and intrusive
[02:50:23.040 --> 02:50:27.680]  and wrong and well what it is is tyranny when they just say you're
[02:50:27.680 --> 02:50:31.320]  disappearing into a black hole yeah you're you're you're detained you can't
[02:50:31.320 --> 02:50:36.840]  now fly for no reason it's all just arbitrary tyranny it's called capital
[02:50:36.840 --> 02:50:40.840]  T death of freedom death of America in the name of protecting America when they
[02:50:40.840 --> 02:50:45.720]  run al-Qaeda thank you so much for your call we're gonna come back and talk to
[02:50:45.720 --> 02:50:53.520]  Michael in Florida and who else has been holding the longest Darnell in Maryland

[02:57:39.040 --> 02:57:41.400]  more impressive than I thought it would be I thought you're a little bit more
[02:57:41.400 --> 02:57:47.960]  smaller smaller operation but evidently the info wars going full on now well
