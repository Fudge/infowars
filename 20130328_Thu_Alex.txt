[00:00.000 --> 00:12.280]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.280 --> 00:21.040]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:21.040 --> 00:45.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Thursday, the 28th day of March, 2013. I am your host,
[00:45.920 --> 00:52.720]  Alex Jones, and we are going to be live here for the next three hours. And what I wanna
[00:52.720 --> 00:59.140]  do is shake the broadcast up, not that it's already not really morphing into something
[00:59.140 --> 01:01.720]  more and more effective every day.
[01:01.720 --> 01:05.960]  I really do, and you know this, always wanna try to sometimes take a lot of phone calls
[01:05.960 --> 01:11.400]  in the first hour instead of just ranting and covering the first few news stories in
[01:11.400 --> 01:17.080]  the first hour. I want to try to take a lot of phone calls from first-time callers concerning
[01:17.080 --> 01:23.280]  the state of the world, how crazy it's gotten, that so many people are waking up while so
[01:23.280 --> 01:30.740]  many others are basically going into their own mind control zone.
[01:30.740 --> 01:38.860]  And we've got to have an awakening that rises above the robot class, as Billy Corrigan has
[01:38.860 --> 01:44.860]  put it. And it really does come down to that. And all of us have to shake ourselves out
[01:44.860 --> 01:52.080]  of our trance. And what am I talking about? Just out of our routine. I was on Billy Corrigan's
[01:52.080 --> 01:58.080]  friend's Mancow show today. And of course, he's my friend as well, and he was talking
[01:58.080 --> 02:03.960]  about Billy Corrigan and the cover of the local newspaper saying, Billy Corrigan, Billy
[02:03.960 --> 02:09.800]  Pulpit, rise above the robot class, something he said in an interview we did last week.
[02:09.800 --> 02:15.540]  And he was going into the point that so many people are unconscious. And even before we
[02:15.540 --> 02:20.840]  were on break coming back to his TV show that's also a simulcast of his radio show, syndicated
[02:20.840 --> 02:25.920]  radio show, he was having to even tell his crew, all right, stop looking at your iPhone,
[02:25.920 --> 02:31.320]  stop texting, get out of your trance, let's focus.
[02:31.320 --> 02:36.240]  And everybody I talk to who's in management of media or anything else, you have to do
[02:36.240 --> 02:42.600]  this now. You have to keep your children away from the phones and the texting. People think
[02:42.600 --> 02:47.180]  they're living through this stuff. And what you're doing is you're dying. And that was
[02:47.180 --> 02:53.920]  a quote that Mancow said today that I am obviously not plagiarizing, stealing. I'm going to be
[02:53.920 --> 02:57.320]  using that term because you're not living in the matrix, you're dying.
[02:57.320 --> 03:03.360]  If you use an iPhone to videotape yourself exposing tyranny and put it on YouTube, if
[03:03.360 --> 03:08.680]  you use it to really talk about something important, then it's a tool to fight corruption.
[03:08.680 --> 03:14.400]  But it still has Trojan horses to track, trace, and control you, and spy on you, and know
[03:14.400 --> 03:20.160]  your innermost secrets. Not just your shoe size, but what movies you like, and what your
[03:20.160 --> 03:23.720]  sexual preferences are, what type of food you're gonna eat, and where you're going.
[03:23.720 --> 03:27.000]  And then they can predict where you're going to go before you're going to go there. We're
[03:27.000 --> 03:34.200]  talking about the end of humanity, and not the rise of some new cybernetic life form
[03:34.200 --> 03:42.040]  that we merge with, but the rise of a nightmare. And of course, our story is linked up at DrudgeReport.com.
[03:42.040 --> 03:50.000]  It's down on the lower right-hand corner, Robo-Reporters to Replace Mainstream Journalists.
[03:50.000 --> 03:58.880]  I talked some about this yesterday. I want to get deeper into that today. There's also
[03:58.880 --> 04:05.960]  another story, Jim Carrey backlash on eBay for his anti-gun video mysteriously disappears.
[04:05.960 --> 04:11.640]  Yeah, they won't, I guess, let you do that there. And then, of course, another article
[04:11.640 --> 04:17.040]  on the right-hand side of DrudgeReport.com, Big Sis Ignores Congressman's Demand for Briefing
[04:17.040 --> 04:24.640]  on Bullet Buys. That's an example of the success that we're starting to have through the alternative
[04:24.640 --> 04:28.000]  and real media. It's just really not even alternative. We are the real media. We are
[04:28.000 --> 04:32.200]  the true diverse media. We are the real liberal media. Liberal meaning liberty and freedom
[04:32.200 --> 04:38.960]  and private property, Second Amendment, due process, right to life, that's liberty. Right
[04:38.960 --> 04:49.240]  to life, liberty and happiness. We are now able to force out and call out the man behind
[04:49.240 --> 04:53.720]  the curtain. And I told you months ago, and I told you a few weeks ago, we're now forcing
[04:53.720 --> 04:58.160]  this bullet story out into the open big time. All right, folks, we'll be right back after
[04:58.160 --> 04:59.560]  this quick break. Stay with us.
[04:59.560 --> 05:04.640]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[05:04.640 --> 05:11.560]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality. It really says that the state is
[05:11.560 --> 05:16.840]  God. The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states
[05:16.840 --> 05:22.400]  on earth. This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps
[05:22.400 --> 05:27.840]  now being expanded nationwide. This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program
[05:27.840 --> 05:32.600]  has established an all-powerful shadow state. Police state four chronicles the sickening
[05:32.600 --> 05:37.880]  depths to which our republic has fallen. Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency
[05:37.880 --> 05:43.840]  dictatorship, body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on
[05:43.840 --> 05:48.600]  every street corner. It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan. The
[05:48.600 --> 05:55.600]  police state isn't coming. It's here. Secure your copy today at Infowars.com or see it

[07:04.480 --> 07:10.080]  increased need to support our immunity and health. At Silver Lungs, we are committed

[07:38.960 --> 07:44.340]  gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish
[07:44.340 --> 07:51.840]  the skin while delivering the silver more effectively. Visit www.silverlungs.com and

[08:02.920 --> 08:08.920]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[08:08.920 --> 08:28.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show. Ladies and gentlemen, we are live. It is Thursday,
[08:28.120 --> 08:36.800]  the 28th day of March 2013. And we're not going to have any guests today because I want
[08:36.800 --> 08:42.840]  to open the phones up and take a giant amount of phone calls and cover a huge amount of
[08:42.840 --> 08:54.360]  just vitally important news and information. Have you thought about what freedom is? Have
[08:54.360 --> 09:02.640]  you thought about what your goals in life are? Are your goals just to satiate beef field,
[09:02.640 --> 09:09.320]  animal drives? Or are your goals something greater?
[09:09.320 --> 09:19.520]  Because though animal drives certainly satisfy you at a base plateau, to reach higher and
[09:19.520 --> 09:25.280]  to truly be fulfilled, you need to think about the big issues and be engaged in the world.
[09:25.280 --> 09:43.700]  And down that path leads enlightenment, wisdom, sanity, dignity, prosperity. I want free will
[09:43.700 --> 09:49.040]  and I want to control my own destiny. I want the truth, the whole truth and nothing but
[09:49.040 --> 09:59.040]  the truth, so help me God. I want to be honorable. I want to be good. I want to be pure.
[09:59.040 --> 10:09.720]  My rudder is consciously and spiritually pointed at the North Star, the pole star of God's
[10:09.720 --> 10:16.520]  justice. My flesh is weak. The spirit is willing, but my flesh is weak. But I want to be a good
[10:16.520 --> 10:23.020]  person and I want to uplift humanity and I want Veritas. I want truth. And that's why
[10:23.020 --> 10:29.120]  the power structure who knows who I am and they know who you are. You've been in a technocracy.
[10:29.120 --> 10:35.040]  I've been in a technocracy. We've been born into it, most of us, for a long time. They
[10:35.040 --> 10:39.360]  know those of us that are true. They know those of us that have hearts. They know those
[10:39.360 --> 10:48.180]  of us that want justice. And so they use false systems of liberalism to guilt us into submitting
[10:48.180 --> 10:52.080]  to them and to following their templates of control.
[10:52.080 --> 10:57.600]  They want to program us. They want to run our lives. They want to use race and religion
[10:57.600 --> 11:04.340]  and socioeconomic and buzzwords to sit there and punch our buttons like we were a biological
[11:04.340 --> 11:13.320]  android. They seek to steal our free will because it empowers them to be able to shape
[11:13.320 --> 11:25.200]  our world. And to use us as their engines of control to have us pay for and enforce
[11:25.200 --> 11:31.120]  and build our own mega prison.
[11:31.120 --> 11:35.380]  And that's why I was reading a headline in the Chicago Sun Times and there was a bunch
[11:35.380 --> 11:42.000]  of other mainstream news articles, dinosaur media articles, with headlines like Billy
[11:42.000 --> 11:49.980]  Corrigan's strange infatuation with a conspiracy theorist. They didn't say with a fellow human.
[11:49.980 --> 12:01.160]  They didn't say with the truth. They didn't say with a phenomenon in political thought.
[12:01.160 --> 12:10.120]  They said in every headline, there was three of them out there I saw, they said conspiracy
[12:10.120 --> 12:20.480]  theorist as a way to denigrate a fellow human's ideas and to also ridicule Billy Corrigan
[12:20.480 --> 12:25.520]  as if he came to speak to me because he has an infatuation.
[12:25.520 --> 12:32.380]  He came to speak to me. And I don't admire somebody like Billy Corrigan because he's
[12:32.380 --> 12:37.360]  a famous rock star that sold 35, 40 million records and made hundreds of millions of dollars,
[12:37.360 --> 12:43.580]  even though I like a lot of his music, love a lot of his music. I admire him because he's
[12:43.580 --> 12:50.320]  really down to earth, has a very small ego, is extremely smart, and didn't come here to
[12:50.320 --> 12:53.160]  talk to Alex Jones.
[12:53.160 --> 12:58.560]  He came here to talk to you, to try to get you outside the box so that we can have a
[12:58.560 --> 13:05.560]  future together. And then they flippantly say his infatuation with a conspiracy theorist
[13:05.560 --> 13:16.240]  in an attempt to demonize Billy Corrigan for coming to see the bad man, Alex Jones.
[13:16.240 --> 13:21.720]  I mean, think about what that is when they say you're a conspiracy theorist because you
[13:21.720 --> 13:29.440]  don't believe certified known liars caught lying hundreds of thousands of times. I mean,
[13:29.440 --> 13:34.240]  the lies are, they tell lies when the truth would suit them because they want to break
[13:34.240 --> 13:42.760]  you and condition you to accept nothing.
[13:42.760 --> 13:54.560]  But a ether, a ocean, a atmosphere, a system, a wavelength of fraud, a war against reality,
[13:54.560 --> 14:07.520]  an overthrow of common sense and the human program. Anyone who looks at the New World
[14:07.520 --> 14:11.880]  Order system, though it claims it's doing everything for civil rights and freedom, can
[14:11.880 --> 14:18.640]  see that it is aimed and targeted at anything wholesome and anything regenerative, anything
[14:18.640 --> 14:29.840]  creative, anything Genesis based. It is a death arrow, a sword, a weapon, a dart, a
[14:29.840 --> 14:42.960]  salvo, a artillery round fired by the forces of death against the engine of life.
[14:42.960 --> 14:51.760]  It is disease and ugliness and abomination of hundreds of animals spliced together in
[14:51.760 --> 15:02.420]  the human form in sentient clone beings of abject ugliness and pain. And you'll never
[15:02.420 --> 15:07.400]  hear anyone call for their rights. You'll see little bunny rabbit symbols, which I agree
[15:07.400 --> 15:13.280]  with on the back of shampoo saying we didn't test on animals. What about Foxconn suicide
[15:13.280 --> 15:18.880]  and forced abortion and apple forced abortion or PepsiCo and fetus cells in the flavoring
[15:18.880 --> 15:22.560]  on purpose to denigrate you.
[15:22.560 --> 15:33.480]  On purpose as satanic alchemy in their own words to defile your soul. What about the
[15:33.480 --> 15:39.240]  real human rights? Well, they've got us worried about football issues of gay marriage and
[15:39.240 --> 15:46.640]  black and white and all this infighting. They are worldwide. And they say, well, we're allowed
[15:46.640 --> 15:50.720]  to mix humans with chimpanzees and humans with jellyfish and humans with spiders.
[15:50.720 --> 15:55.440]  And don't worry, we kill them before they come to term. But we could keep them past
[15:55.440 --> 16:00.240]  term, which we know they've done. But that's somewhat shielded and classified. It's leaked
[16:00.240 --> 16:06.440]  out to some policy papers, which it shouldn't have, just like any matter weapons leaked
[16:06.440 --> 16:07.440]  out.
[16:07.440 --> 16:11.960]  It was in the San Francisco Chronicle and a few other papers a decade ago. Just like
[16:11.960 --> 16:20.520]  meteor guns, D.U. Shaybo's leaked 20 years ago. The space fleet they've got, the drone
[16:20.520 --> 16:26.920]  fleet they've had up since the 70s. More than 15 generations of weapons systems up there
[16:26.920 --> 16:38.040]  now. Arrogant globalist in debates against Bob Bowman and others have been tricked on
[16:38.040 --> 16:43.520]  the stage into releasing classified information is how Bowman's able to talk about that.
[16:43.520 --> 16:54.360]  But the issue here is that you've got humans, human embryos spliced with all these other
[16:54.360 --> 16:58.880]  animals and insects. And then they say, well, they don't have any human rights because they're
[16:58.880 --> 17:06.880]  not human. You see that little lawyer trick, but then the bunny rabbit has a right. But
[17:06.880 --> 17:09.640]  it doesn't really.
[17:09.640 --> 17:13.880]  And the globalist, the transhumanist, the eugenicist said, we will teach them to care
[17:13.880 --> 17:18.560]  about the animals and then misplace their concern for humans onto animals. And by the
[17:18.560 --> 17:23.880]  way, I support those that are against abusing mammals and other highly intelligent sentient
[17:23.880 --> 17:30.520]  beings. If something's a prey animal designed to be eaten, bovine, deer, things like that.
[17:30.520 --> 17:37.040]  You don't kill them out of pleasure, but it's part of the process. But we're removed more
[17:37.040 --> 17:44.200]  and more from our humanity where we just pull up and eat the hamburger at McDonald's.
[17:44.200 --> 17:50.840]  And that really is a form of corruption. And we all are involved in it because to not be
[17:50.840 --> 17:58.400]  involved in the humanity is to lose your humanity. Let me tell you something, you shoot an animal
[17:58.400 --> 18:04.380]  with a bow. You slit its throat to bleed it out so that the meat doesn't spoil. You butcher
[18:04.380 --> 18:09.640]  it yourself. You cook it yourself. You're thinking about that animal while you're eating
[18:09.640 --> 18:12.720]  it.
[18:12.720 --> 18:18.240]  And it's activating synapses and instincts in your mind of the entire human experience
[18:18.240 --> 18:24.840]  when you don't need to do that to connect to your race memories. You can do it by digging
[18:24.840 --> 18:32.880]  in the dirt. You can do it by planting seeds and then watering plants. And just doing that
[18:32.880 --> 18:37.640]  will open up. And I've never read this, I know this. I'm sure someone's written it because
[18:37.640 --> 18:43.240]  any truth you've already found self-evident, others as well, activates and literally communicates
[18:43.240 --> 18:50.400]  with your soul. Going through the rituals of combat, going through the rituals of fighting
[18:50.400 --> 18:56.760]  when you're a young man, that's why they want to make it illegal, put you in prison.
[18:56.760 --> 19:04.440]  That unlocks the synapses. That is the rites of passage. That's why the social engineers,
[19:04.440 --> 19:08.760]  I'm giving you the deepest truths here, want to destroy all the ancient covenants and all
[19:08.760 --> 19:16.880]  the ancient rituals of humanity. It is to break the genetic encoding recordings that
[19:16.880 --> 19:20.360]  are in the DNA from our ancestors.
[19:20.360 --> 19:28.480]  And the chills I feel when I talk about this is losing all of that information. I cry sometimes.
[19:28.480 --> 19:32.840]  People say it's fake and it's not because I could feel the death of the connection to
[19:32.840 --> 19:39.000]  our ancestors and everything that's going to come in the future. It's the end of humanity
[19:39.000 --> 19:45.240]  and a horrible abomination. And I feel all of our ancestors crying out against us, that
[19:45.240 --> 19:49.520]  we awaken and have strength against this, that we rise above the robot class, that we
[19:49.520 --> 19:56.480]  break our chains and transcend the technocracy and take to the stars in our true destiny.
[19:56.480 --> 20:01.200]  We'll be right back as I break down the news and give out the number to take your calls.
[20:01.200 --> 20:06.440]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food and firearms. But if you don't have a home security system,
[20:06.440 --> 20:11.240]  then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection. When you're sleeping

[22:33.560 --> 22:37.440]  from counterfeit and carting to a private bank, having it lead back at interest, forcing
[22:37.440 --> 22:41.480]  taxes to service debt. This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central
[22:41.480 --> 22:44.880]  bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than
[22:44.880 --> 22:49.440]  a standing army. Hi, Ted Anderson. I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary

[23:03.480 --> 23:09.060]  than perfect health? Hi, this is Pastor Ginny. And as a woman of faith, I spent many years
[23:09.060 --> 23:15.960]  in ministry burdened with anxiety and fear. But in 2010, I met Dr. Carolyn Dean, and I
[23:15.960 --> 23:22.500]  took her recommendation to try RNA drops. Within days of taking RNA drops, my anxiety
[23:22.500 --> 23:28.120]  began to lift. My joy was restored. And the peace of mind that I would have once called
[23:28.120 --> 23:34.740]  a miracle has now become normal to me. Discover what RNA drops can do for you. Order your

[24:05.680 --> 24:11.600]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[24:11.600 --> 24:22.320]  All right, Alex Jones here back live. Think about all the stuff they're doing in those
[24:22.320 --> 24:28.800]  cloning labs. Now, it's not just PepsiCo, but all the big companies are putting fetal
[24:28.800 --> 24:33.680]  tissue and stuff in different food products. They're not letting us even know food's got
[24:33.680 --> 24:37.480]  GMO in it. And now they're moving to put aspartame in thousands of products and not tell you
[24:37.480 --> 24:46.240]  including milk, ice cream. Diabetes is exploding with cancer exploding and it's just all supposedly
[24:46.240 --> 24:47.240]  funny.
[24:47.240 --> 24:50.600]  You know, I get up here and warn people and these newspaper reporters get up and make
[24:50.600 --> 24:57.240]  jokes about it. Aha, there's the conspiracy theorist. It was even a Washington Times article
[24:57.240 --> 25:03.080]  about now the people warning of the drones in the police state. We've been proven right
[25:03.080 --> 25:08.080]  as libertarian conservatives, but we've now gotta back off a little bit if we wanna maintain
[25:08.080 --> 25:11.640]  our credibility and not be like Alex Jones.
[25:11.640 --> 25:16.000]  I was reading that this morning and it's so obvious. It's like, don't listen to what this
[25:16.000 --> 25:24.800]  guy says. It's dangerous. Why, because it's real? I mean, we forced all this out in the
[25:24.800 --> 25:31.860]  open. We forced the 2 billion plus bullets, the tens of thousands of armored vehicles.
[25:31.860 --> 25:37.400]  One purchase was 2,700 a few months ago. The things are all over the streets where I live.
[25:37.400 --> 25:43.080]  Every police department's being given new giant vehicles and Marine Corps surplus and
[25:43.080 --> 25:47.400]  army and helicopters. I mean, that's no secret. They get up on the news. I saw another article
[25:47.400 --> 25:52.520]  saying bullets debunked, armored vehicles debunked, drones debunked.
[25:52.520 --> 25:59.680]  I can't even track them all. Alex Jones is lying, drugs reports lying. Simultaneously,
[25:59.680 --> 26:03.320]  while they have other articles explaining why they have the billions of bullets. It's
[26:03.320 --> 26:10.360]  so obvious. Big Sis ignores congressman's demand for briefing on bullet by drudgereport.com.
[26:10.360 --> 26:17.260]  Watson, I just talked to him, he's counting them up. It's well over 15 now, like I told
[26:17.260 --> 26:19.040]  you earlier in the week.
[26:19.040 --> 26:24.640]  I would guess it'll be 30 by next week. It'll probably be 100 by the week after that. And
[26:24.640 --> 26:29.040]  then if we crashed and can force the committee chairman to have a hearing about, well, why
[26:29.040 --> 26:34.520]  is Delta Force operating domestically? See, this is a whole can of worms. You can send
[26:34.520 --> 26:36.400]  these to Congress, don't think they even know it all.
[26:36.400 --> 26:44.280]  They're too busy. Send them the local LA Times article about Marines running DWI checkpoints
[26:44.280 --> 26:54.520]  100 miles into California. By the Sequoias. The proto articles about them running them
[26:54.520 --> 26:59.420]  five, six years ago in Southern California. In the local smaller papers that alternative
[26:59.420 --> 27:01.440]  media that first broke it.
[27:01.440 --> 27:06.040]  Send them all the info about in Tennessee army, regular army checkpoints on highways
[27:06.040 --> 27:10.640]  that the governor criticized years ago and stay. They just keep saying no, there's no
[27:10.640 --> 27:17.440]  black helicopters. No, you didn't see a checkpoint. I mean, I've walked up to troops at a checkpoint.
[27:17.440 --> 27:20.320]  It's in one of my police state films, which was at police state two. And they're like,
[27:20.320 --> 27:21.800]  what are you a conspiracy theorist?
[27:21.800 --> 27:25.300]  I'm like, hey, this is violating posit comitatus. What are you doing? What are you a conspiracy
[27:25.300 --> 27:29.360]  theorist? We've had our camera guys, they come over with guns and the police take their
[27:29.360 --> 27:34.120]  cameras. Later gave them back to him and said, why are you a conspiracy theorist? As they
[27:34.120 --> 27:39.760]  did gun confiscation drills on record and told the local newspaper that.
[27:39.760 --> 27:46.120]  I mean, this is mind control. And see, it's such a wall of fraud. People think that's
[27:46.120 --> 27:51.120]  because they're weak. And it is, they are weak, but they're also strong. It's strong
[27:51.120 --> 27:57.240]  if you accept it. It's a big wave. And they're denying the waves coming in. And we're going,
[27:57.240 --> 27:58.960]  no, that's a big wave of lies.
[27:58.960 --> 28:04.780]  So if you just accept it, you've now bought into the lies, is what I'm trying to say.
[28:04.780 --> 28:10.000]  And I mean, I see them lying and it makes me pinch myself and go, am I wrong? And even
[28:10.000 --> 28:13.960]  though I know the information front and backwards and up one side and down the other, it still
[28:13.960 --> 28:22.160]  makes me question sometime because this lying is so unnatural, so over the top.
[28:22.160 --> 28:26.320]  Because in a natural system, if somebody got caught lying over and over and over again,
[28:26.320 --> 28:34.720]  you throw them out of the village. So it's an attempt of the establishment to force feed
[28:34.720 --> 28:38.400]  the lies. Here's the toll free number to join us for first time callers to talk about anything
[28:38.400 --> 28:48.860]  I've been raising, any points, any topics, 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231. And we will get

[29:09.660 --> 29:16.320]  throughout the transmission today. But we also have the report yesterday that I said
[29:16.320 --> 29:22.080]  I would get to. Will you guys reprint me that? Or I guess it is here in my stack. Yeah, Robot
[29:22.080 --> 29:25.080]  Reporters Replacing Mainstream Journalists, I will get to that today.
[29:25.080 --> 29:28.300]  And again, it's rolled off the front page of Infowars. I'm gonna have it added back
[29:28.300 --> 29:33.320]  to the front page. You can also find it at drudgereport.com. It'll probably scroll off

[29:37.800 --> 29:46.680]  You see, all you that sell this system, the energy and everything and sell your soul to

[30:05.560 --> 30:10.640]  law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies. As a result, millions
[30:10.640 --> 30:15.800]  are stockpiling food, gold and weapons. But how will these items help if you or one of

[33:20.440 --> 33:29.400]  Thomas Jefferson. Thomas Jefferson is alive with us now. His ideas, his information, transmitting
[33:29.400 --> 33:34.280]  down through time, his genetics transferring through hundreds of thousands of living people
[33:34.280 --> 33:40.740]  today. And just as you and I will go back to the dust from whence we came, our ideas
[33:40.740 --> 33:46.760]  and what we do is transmitted through eternity forever. Not just here in the visual light
[33:46.760 --> 33:52.940]  spectrum but in the spiritual spectrum as well that is now all been scientifically documented
[33:52.940 --> 34:00.080]  and proven to be even more real than the limited system with which our five senses are able
[34:00.080 --> 34:06.080]  to connect. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this Thursday, 28th
[34:06.080 --> 34:13.960]  day of March, 2013 worldwide transmission. The toll free number to join us is 800-259-9231
[34:13.960 --> 34:18.200]  and I will go to your calls in just a moment. Some of the giant magnitude information we'll
[34:18.200 --> 34:23.000]  cover when the next hour starts is Obama has betrayed America yet again by signing the
[34:23.000 --> 34:30.200]  Monsanto Protection Act into law. That's right, ladies and gentlemen, he has signed the Monsanto
[34:30.200 --> 34:35.600]  Protection Act publicly written by them that you not be able to have food labeled, that
[34:35.600 --> 34:39.820]  they be able to go after anybody they want, because again, they're part of the military
[34:39.820 --> 34:44.800]  industrial complex eugenics prime directive. So they're totally above the law, just as
[34:44.800 --> 34:49.080]  the vaccine makers are. They can kill any amount of people they want and they're quietly
[34:49.080 --> 34:52.340]  paid off if you're lucky by the government with taxpayer money.
[34:52.340 --> 34:59.000]  Also cover up of Adam Lanza to psychotropic drugs, Paul Joseph Watson, key article on
[34:59.000 --> 35:05.300]  that whole black op. Biden, Senate gun bill vote only the beginning. Of course, we're
[35:05.300 --> 35:09.120]  going to get your guns, Mr. and Mrs. America, we will ban them all, that's the official
[35:09.120 --> 35:12.660]  UN treaty, but then they tell you doesn't exist.
[35:12.660 --> 35:16.320]  The official Catholic newspaper comes out and says, repeal the Second Amendment, take
[35:16.320 --> 35:20.440]  all the guns. The headline is repeal the Second Amendment, but no one's coming after your
[35:20.440 --> 35:27.680]  guns, crazy man. Again, it's standard military procedure in World War I on up to announce
[35:27.680 --> 35:33.440]  this is not an assault while you're being overrun by infantry and tanks.
[35:33.440 --> 35:36.680]  They told him at Waco, we are not assaulting, come out with your hands up. And you can see
[35:36.680 --> 35:40.160]  on the flare footage, they come out and they shoot them from behind the tanks. They had
[35:40.160 --> 35:46.480]  infantry Delta Force behind the tanks. It is standard, standard, standard, standard
[35:46.480 --> 35:47.480]  procedure.
[35:47.480 --> 35:52.560]  And you're like, but it doesn't make sense. They're targeting the public that doesn't
[35:52.560 --> 35:57.560]  know how to even read a newspaper, that gets their news from movies. They go see Olympus
[35:57.560 --> 36:02.960]  has fallen and they believe North Korea can really attack the White House. North Korea
[36:02.960 --> 36:07.080]  has to create photoshopped stuff of landings on the beach.
[36:07.080 --> 36:14.240]  They can't produce automobiles there. They can't tie their shoelaces because they're
[36:14.240 --> 36:19.780]  a pure authoritarian system and parasites have to have things to feed on and they've
[36:19.780 --> 36:25.820]  already sucked their hose dry. They are shriveled, tiny, starving vampire with 14 foot long gray
[36:25.820 --> 36:31.200]  hair that's crawling around on the ground eating bugs, okay?
[36:31.200 --> 36:36.640]  The New World Order has taken the blood supply of liberty and is a 1,000 foot foaming at
[36:36.640 --> 36:42.280]  the mouth demonic goblin because we've empowered it. But if it was able to take over it too
[36:42.280 --> 36:47.600]  would shrivel up, okay? The only reason North Korea is threatening to attack everybody is
[36:47.600 --> 36:48.960]  because it's like a vampire.
[36:48.960 --> 36:53.560]  It's like The Hunger. You ever seen that movie? Probably the best vampire movie out there
[36:53.560 --> 37:02.560]  with I'm having one of those moments when I can't even sometimes know a common sense
[37:02.560 --> 37:08.200]  name. Little China Girl, all that stuff. What's the name? Bowie. Yeah, Bowie. Yeah, but I
[37:08.200 --> 37:11.720]  know the last name. What's the first name? David Bowie, yeah.
[37:11.720 --> 37:16.960]  Folks, I got so much stuff going on in my mind today. I never go out to break and like
[37:16.960 --> 37:21.480]  start saying the phone number as we go out to break and it cuts off. It's just everything
[37:21.480 --> 37:27.740]  is so real and I'm realizing just how effective we are and it's the opposite of a power trip.
[37:27.740 --> 37:32.160]  So many people get a little bit of power and they go crazy in a megalomania power trip.
[37:32.160 --> 37:37.520]  I see that all the time and it freaks me out. With yours truly, it's the opposite and I
[37:37.520 --> 37:45.440]  am humbled and I ask God for guidance and God has given me great comfort even in adversity
[37:45.440 --> 37:55.160]  and at the same time, it's just incredible to behold this.
[37:55.160 --> 38:00.560]  One cannot be told about The Matrix, one must see it and I just wish that I could reach
[38:00.560 --> 38:04.520]  the people that are totally dumbed down, that get their news from sitcoms and dramas. They're
[38:04.520 --> 38:11.120]  just filled with anti-human, anti-decency, anti-life, anti-wholesomeness garbage and
[38:11.120 --> 38:17.120]  that they think the bondage of the New World Order and all its degeneracy, they think that
[38:17.120 --> 38:26.680]  is liberty.
[38:26.680 --> 38:42.080]  One cannot see revelation without having spiritual eyes. Those of you deceived by this, I don't
[38:42.080 --> 38:50.780]  even hate you anymore and in a way, a warm friend has left me because hate is a warm
[38:50.780 --> 38:58.520]  thing. I always fought the globalist because I have love and that's my main engine but
[38:58.520 --> 39:05.840]  there's always a nice strata of hatred and now it's not even hatred. I am disgusted by
[39:05.840 --> 39:11.880]  these people. I now can see them clearer than ever and just see how pathetic they are and
[39:11.880 --> 39:19.960]  how weak and being able to see into the future, not in some crystal ball way but historically
[39:19.960 --> 39:26.440]  in the knowledge and the data and knowing the enemy by spending so much time really
[39:26.440 --> 39:34.260]  getting deep into it, it is such a giant fraud.
[39:34.260 --> 39:44.320]  Those that are weak and were hurt seek for power for power's sake and become delusional
[39:44.320 --> 39:55.280]  and lie to themselves and then are turned over to wickedness. And then you realize wickedness
[39:55.280 --> 40:06.580]  is a flailing, frothing, ugly thing. I know I'm preaching and I said I'd go to your calls.
[40:06.580 --> 40:11.740]  We're gonna get into the whole Monsanto thing. I mean the abomination that they're getting
[40:11.740 --> 40:17.680]  federal laws now out there that no one can label anything. I mean it's just unbelievable
[40:17.680 --> 40:22.480]  and that they have total liability protection and they're God.
[40:22.480 --> 40:30.200]  When that company has a history of crimes against humanity that staggers the mind. And
[40:30.200 --> 40:34.880]  if humanity would just realize their peril, we could get out of this. But again, that's
[40:34.880 --> 40:39.160]  a conspiracy theory. There is no danger. There is no bad man behind the curtain. There is
[40:39.160 --> 40:44.000]  no curtain. There is no establishment. There is no colluding. There is no manipulation.
[40:44.000 --> 40:49.960]  No, no, no, that only goes on our daily lives. It's not going on up top. Of course, historically
[40:49.960 --> 40:59.680]  we know it's going on at the deepest levels.
[40:59.680 --> 41:04.560]  And then I look at all the news here where they are now coming back with second rounds
[41:04.560 --> 41:14.120]  of taking more people's money. They are banning cash all over the world and secondhand transactions
[41:14.120 --> 41:23.800]  from Louisiana to Russia. Russia to ban cash transactions over $10,000, next to over $5.
[41:23.800 --> 41:32.720]  They have stolen our money. Cyprus banks reopen with strict restrictions. 300 euros a day,
[41:32.720 --> 41:38.120]  that's basically dollars, withdrawn limit because they're coming back for more.
[41:38.120 --> 41:44.160]  No money allowed to leave country. Russia to ban cash transactions, security tied as
[41:44.160 --> 41:48.940]  tensions run high. The security is to make sure the bank robbery can happen. The reverse
[41:48.940 --> 41:56.240]  bank robbery where the teller aims the gun at you. Store exchange, stock exchange still
[41:56.240 --> 42:02.880]  closed in Cyprus. We need to get him back on. Not even gold will save you from what
[42:02.880 --> 42:05.400]  is coming.
[42:05.400 --> 42:12.640]  Bitcoins explode. Bitcoins explode. One of the inventors of Bitcoin wants to come on
[42:12.640 --> 42:22.000]  the show. We probably need to get him on. And think about what's now just been normalized.
[42:22.000 --> 42:26.720]  Think about what's now just become commonplace. Yeah, they're now saying all over Europe,
[42:26.720 --> 42:29.920]  they're gonna start taking money out of people's accounts. Cyprus was a test run.
[42:29.920 --> 42:35.800]  It's like in the old days, they test chemical and biological weapons on an island, in case
[42:35.800 --> 42:41.280]  it got out of hand. Well, they always test stuff like this on an island too. I laugh
[42:41.280 --> 42:48.880]  cuz I can look into the mindset of the establishment. And that's really just a political reflection
[42:48.880 --> 42:54.360]  when I cackle like a witch, cuz it really hurts.
[42:54.360 --> 43:01.520]  And we tend to laugh when things are uncomfortable. But I am kind of laughing at the people that
[43:01.520 --> 43:05.920]  are just still in denial. There's no problem. There's no armored vehicles. There's no tanks,
[43:05.920 --> 43:08.960]  even though they're using them right now in Cyprus. They're going after the accounts in
[43:08.960 --> 43:13.640]  Greece, Spain, and they'll end up in Germany and they'll end up in America.
[43:13.640 --> 43:18.960]  They'll end up everywhere. And that's what the casual society is all about. And I told
[43:18.960 --> 43:25.000]  you this was coming forever, but I'm the fear monger. I'm trying to scare you. That's what
[43:25.000 --> 43:29.600]  they say. Really, I thought I was trying to warn you cuz I thought you were a man.
[43:29.600 --> 43:34.200]  I thought you were a woman. I thought you'd wanna do something about this. I thought you
[43:34.200 --> 43:39.120]  were like me. I thought she didn't care what people thought about you. I thought she wanted
[43:39.120 --> 43:43.720]  the truth. I thought she didn't want people running over you, pushing you around.
[43:43.720 --> 43:47.640]  But you think it's a virtue to cower, don't you? I'm talking to my enemies out there.
[43:47.640 --> 43:53.240]  All of you that are gonna be replaced by computers within three years, most of what you see will
[43:53.240 --> 43:58.040]  be a master propagandist will write it. The White House, the corporations will release
[43:58.040 --> 44:03.920]  it, and then computers will rewrite it. A human, this was put out a decade ago by MIT.
[44:03.920 --> 44:07.320]  That's how I knew it was coming. Now it's being announced. How great it is. The computers
[44:07.320 --> 44:11.400]  do a better job than humans. Wired Magazine, everybody. See, they're rolling it out like,
[44:11.400 --> 44:12.880]  hey, we got a new idea.
[44:12.880 --> 44:17.360]  Computers are gonna write the articles, and they do a better job. They're given the faulty
[44:17.360 --> 44:22.200]  data. See, it's like Zeitgeist, a big computer will run the world, and we'll live in these
[44:22.200 --> 44:30.760]  big plastic communes. Who programs the computer? Who gives it the data? The master programmer,
[44:30.760 --> 44:37.400]  the master architect, who would that be?
[44:37.400 --> 44:41.880]  And so now the White House has told the reporters, we may just get rid of press conferences.
[44:41.880 --> 44:45.120]  You know what, if you don't toe the line perfectly, you're not gonna be in our meetings, you're
[44:45.120 --> 44:48.880]  not gonna be given the press release. We're just gonna release it ourselves. And then
[44:48.880 --> 44:53.840]  they're gonna have with gnome to plumes, pen names, computers.
[44:53.840 --> 44:58.480]  You could have one computer with 1,000 gnome to plumes. And then a human at first will
[44:58.480 --> 45:03.200]  spot check it. It'll say this article was reviewed by, it'll have the little human's
[45:03.200 --> 45:07.320]  name down there. And see, out of the gate you're told, you're trash, you're dumb, you're
[45:07.320 --> 45:08.320]  over.
[45:08.320 --> 45:15.880]  Deep blue, big blue, he's the master. Nobody can do it, he can. And so the master computer
[45:15.880 --> 45:19.480]  engineers are already over the computers. They already have computers that track the
[45:19.480 --> 45:22.920]  computers that control the computers. And they have robots that build the robots that
[45:22.920 --> 45:27.440]  build the robots that service the robots with robot trucks that deliver the robots.
[45:27.440 --> 45:33.680]  It's already there. They're getting ready to hammer down and sit there in a giant simulation
[45:33.680 --> 45:37.960]  watching what they do to you. They've got a simulation small city here in Austin where
[45:37.960 --> 45:40.760]  they give everybody discounts to live in a slave grid and everything's tracked.
[45:40.760 --> 45:46.640]  And they're rolling out, those are the cancer metastasides. Imperial probe droids are being
[45:46.640 --> 45:53.680]  planted on your house. They're in all the new devices. They're called the smart meters.
[45:53.680 --> 46:00.840]  What is that? Sounds like it's Imperial. Boom, right on the side of your house. All AI, the
[46:00.840 --> 46:05.720]  underground cities, the clone operations, the splicing, it's all on. And I'm up here
[46:05.720 --> 46:10.920]  right now just telling you, as the shadows lengthen, what's coming?
[46:10.920 --> 46:17.280]  The shut off of the infrastructure worldwide, the shut off of everything. People say you're
[46:17.280 --> 46:27.120]  scary. You're trying to scare me. You don't want the stimulus, do you see? An amoeba,
[46:27.120 --> 46:33.080]  if you have a single cell organism in a Petri dish, in fact, we could pull this up. Guys,
[46:33.080 --> 46:47.640]  pull up amoeba, fleas, heat. You can find these microscope videos online. You can even
[46:47.640 --> 46:50.840]  look at neurons that when a toxin or something comes up, they're electrochemical, they'll
[46:50.840 --> 46:53.160]  pull back in live time.
[46:53.160 --> 46:59.080]  Let me pull back from that. Let me pull back from that, but you won't pull back. See, the
[46:59.080 --> 47:06.240]  cell's afraid when it pulls back. It's bad, it's bad. It's fear mongering. A deer jumps
[47:06.240 --> 47:09.640]  out in front of your car, you slam the brakes on, you're fearful. No, I thought you weren't
[47:09.640 --> 47:10.640]  gonna hit the deer.
[47:10.640 --> 47:15.520]  You saw these houses on fire, you're supposed to let it burn. And they say, Bob, I was out
[47:15.520 --> 47:18.600]  of town, why didn't you call the fire department? Well, I would have been fear mongering. I
[47:18.600 --> 47:25.000]  thought it would have saved my house, Bob. You're a conspiracy theorist. No, I, and see
[47:25.000 --> 47:28.360]  people already in public don't save someone most of the time when they're choking. When
[47:28.360 --> 47:30.200]  someone's hit by a car, no one helps them.
[47:30.200 --> 47:33.540]  When someone's stabbed, no one helps them. They have to pass laws where you get arrested
[47:33.540 --> 47:36.680]  now if you don't. But the cops say they're above the law, they don't have to render aid
[47:36.680 --> 47:44.240]  now. But you gotta turn your guns into them. And you're a coward if you wanna own a gun,
[47:44.240 --> 47:50.560]  Jim Carrey says. You wanna protect your family. I guess a raccoon that has claws and teeth.
[47:50.560 --> 47:55.720]  If you try to attack it, it'll bite you cuz it's a coward. Not because it's normal and
[47:55.720 --> 48:00.360]  strong and not a coward. No, no, it's to be brave is to be a coward. To rally people against
[48:00.360 --> 48:03.600]  evil is the fear monger.
[48:03.600 --> 48:14.100]  To tell your neighbor their house is on fire is a crime. And I look at all the demonic
[48:14.100 --> 48:19.320]  fallen people who know this show's for real, who at a spiritual level don't need to get
[48:19.320 --> 48:23.460]  orders from the New World Order. They get their orders from the guy that gives the New
[48:23.460 --> 48:29.800]  World Order their orders. At a spiritual level, animated the Walking Dead biological androids.
[48:29.800 --> 48:33.480]  They've had big surveys out, why is Walking Dead so popular? Cuz people go, I feel like
[48:33.480 --> 48:39.200]  a zombie, I feel empty. And by seeing the truth that they're spiritually dead, they
[48:39.200 --> 48:42.440]  find a warning.
[48:42.440 --> 48:50.720]  But they also then can laugh at someone more dead than they. A single cell organism, an
[48:50.720 --> 49:03.080]  amoeba, will run away from a tiny wire put into the Petri dish. But see, there's nowhere
[49:03.080 --> 49:08.200]  for us to run. We can't run to the New World, we can't run to the hills. We have to run
[49:08.200 --> 49:09.200]  into the enemy.
[49:09.200 --> 49:15.480]  We have to cause a total awakening at our greatest time of peril to this time of wickedness
[49:15.480 --> 49:22.400]  to reverse the tide. And we can do that, it's within your grasp. I'm gonna go to break and
[49:22.400 --> 49:26.000]  I said I'd go to calls and I just can't do it. Because I have too much I wanna say but
[49:26.000 --> 49:28.040]  I'm gonna go to your calls in this segment.
[49:28.040 --> 49:35.640]  And then in the next hour, at the bottom of the next hour, I will go to a news portion
[49:35.640 --> 49:39.800]  on the police state, on the Al Qaeda being run by the government, on North Korea, on
[49:39.800 --> 49:43.880]  Monsanto becoming God politically just above the law. And Congress already said they're
[49:43.880 --> 49:47.840]  above the law on insider trading. And Obama says he's above the law and that NATO commands
[49:47.840 --> 49:49.880]  our military and he's allowed to do fast and furious.
[49:49.880 --> 49:55.040]  And Congress is gonna exempt itself from the gun laws and federal employees will be exempt
[49:55.040 --> 49:59.600]  in Feinstein's bill from the gun. I mean, wow, hypocrisy, all men aren't created equal,
[49:59.600 --> 50:05.720]  total discrimination. But see, you can't recognize it cuz the only discrimination is why is if
[50:05.720 --> 50:07.440]  you're white, then you're inherently racist.
[50:07.440 --> 50:13.120]  You get everybody fighting with each other over race, which is so 1,000 years ago. I
[50:13.120 --> 50:18.260]  mean, we're facing the extinction of humanity, the robot globalist technocracy merger with
[50:18.260 --> 50:25.800]  machine takeover on record. Humans being replaced with robots everywhere, it's already begun.
[50:25.800 --> 50:28.480]  And when they're done with you, they're gonna shut off the infrastructure, the lights, the
[50:28.480 --> 50:29.480]  power.
[50:29.480 --> 50:33.880]  And when you're gonna run into the compact cities, you're gonna go along with the system
[50:33.880 --> 50:37.480]  thinking you're gonna be taken care of as your technocrat, you're gonna die too. None
[50:37.480 --> 50:47.800]  of you are part of this. The globalist plan to kill 99.9999999 and then some. Publicly,
[50:47.800 --> 50:51.700]  they say 80%, so the 20 feels like you're part of it. Higher up, it's 90. You get into
[50:51.700 --> 50:56.200]  higher level documents. They plan on killing all humans and merging with a machine and
[50:56.200 --> 51:01.400]  becoming God. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[51:01.400 --> 51:05.320]  If you're listening, you know your basic freedoms are being threatened every day. If you're
[51:05.320 --> 51:11.000]  listening, you know the economy is not getting better. You know gas and food prices are skyrocketing.

[53:00.560 --> 53:04.160]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the bestselling book, Cancer Step Outside the
[53:04.160 --> 53:10.480]  Box. I want you to know some very important information. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan
[53:10.480 --> 53:14.600]  requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the
[53:14.600 --> 53:20.180]  President could obtain this world-class healer. Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are
[53:20.180 --> 53:24.720]  used around the world to keep people healthy. Now you can protect yourself and your loved

[55:01.480 --> 55:05.200]  Zach in Texas, you're on the air, sir. Welcome.
[55:05.200 --> 55:06.200]  Hello?
[55:06.200 --> 55:09.600]  Yes, go ahead. Welcome to the airwaves.
[55:09.600 --> 55:16.720]  Howdy, Alex. Basically, I wanted to talk to you about a situation with some anti-Second
[55:16.720 --> 55:19.440]  Amendment police in Arlington, Texas.
[55:19.440 --> 55:23.440]  Yeah, Dallas actually has a knock and talks with one of the first cities in the country
[55:23.440 --> 55:27.560]  and the surrounding. They come to your door in legal, lawful areas and ask to inspect
[55:27.560 --> 55:28.560]  your guns. Yes.
[55:28.560 --> 55:36.320]  Well, I didn't quite have that situation, but something similar. I live in a bad neighborhood
[55:36.320 --> 55:41.600]  in Arlington and there's gunfire on a regular basis in my neighborhood. About three weeks
[55:41.600 --> 55:48.080]  ago, called 911, had officers come out, requested to talk to them, stopped by the house and
[55:48.080 --> 55:51.800]  said, well, I know you think you heard fireworks.
[55:51.800 --> 55:57.200]  I know you think you heard shots in your neighborhood, but they were just fireworks. No big deal.
[55:57.200 --> 56:03.320]  I told them, hey, you know, I own firearms. I will defend myself. If somebody in my neighborhood
[56:03.320 --> 56:08.400]  starts shooting in my front yard, I'm going to defend myself. Well, fast forward a week
[56:08.400 --> 56:09.600]  and a half.
[56:09.600 --> 56:13.800]  And apparently there were some more gunshots in my neighborhood about four thirty five
[56:13.800 --> 56:16.760]  o'clock in the afternoon. And they came and said you did it.
[56:16.760 --> 56:21.440]  Yeah, they came, pulled up in front of my house. I just pulled into my driveway from
[56:21.440 --> 56:26.280]  coming from the gas station to get some gas to mow my lawn. I get pulled out of my truck.
[56:26.280 --> 56:30.520]  My mom gets pulled out of my truck. We get set on the curb. Search me, search my mom.
[56:30.520 --> 56:35.560]  Now, I don't know what it is about Dallas police or that surrounding area, but the public
[56:35.560 --> 56:39.640]  is so Christian and so naive. They're good people. They're so naive. And some of the
[56:39.640 --> 56:40.640]  cops are good.
[56:40.640 --> 56:44.560]  But growing up, you know, they were drug dealers and stuff's what I know about in Rockwall.
[56:44.560 --> 56:49.520]  But I had my car stolen in a pretty nice neighborhood back when I was in college. I had an old girlfriend.
[56:49.520 --> 56:54.760]  I'd go visit up there and my Mustang got stolen and I called and I was polite and they just
[56:54.760 --> 56:55.960]  said, well, never gets picked up.
[56:55.960 --> 57:01.840]  We'll call you. Here's your case number. And I said, OK, thanks and hung up. And cops showed
[57:01.840 --> 57:05.680]  up two minutes later, got in my face, came in the apartment without a warrant, pushed
[57:05.680 --> 57:09.900]  me up against the wall and said, you don't ever hang up on us, boy. And I went, you're
[57:09.900 --> 57:14.680]  joking, right? And it was just like really weird.
[57:14.680 --> 57:18.000]  I never told the whole story. It's just so unbelievable. But it was like you didn't steal
[57:18.000 --> 57:22.600]  your car, did you? Look, anybody in the third world country knows you don't call the police.
[57:22.600 --> 57:26.700]  You will always be accused of the crime because they don't want to be called.
[57:26.700 --> 57:30.920]  They want to go out and generate revenue. I mean, in Chicago, less than half the murders
[57:30.920 --> 57:35.720]  even get investigated now. And that's how the mafia wants it. When you have a mafia
[57:35.720 --> 57:40.800]  government, I mean, hell, the Dallas PD helped kill Kennedy. They've been corrupt forever.
[57:40.800 --> 57:44.320]  People think the mafia is only in Illinois and New York and stuff. Give me a break, folks.
[57:44.320 --> 57:45.320]  I'm sorry. Go ahead.
[57:45.320 --> 57:52.800]  Oh, well, yeah, yeah. Just so how did it end? How did it end? Basically, like I said, they
[57:52.800 --> 57:58.680]  got me on the curb, got my mom on the curb. I had a I do have a concealed carry permit.
[57:58.680 --> 58:02.840]  How evil. Of course, they knew that they ran your license. Well, yeah, yeah. Thank God
[58:02.840 --> 58:05.160]  for me. I didn't have it on me. I had it in the glove box.
[58:05.160 --> 58:10.560]  So how does this end? They went ahead. They searched my truck. I tried to file a complaint
[58:10.560 --> 58:15.240]  and was told, well, procedure was followed and you can't make a complaint.
[58:15.240 --> 58:19.080]  It's not a complaint. I ought to get some of our legal eagles on here. You go file the
[58:19.080 --> 58:22.600]  criminal complaint and it's criminal. If they don't let you file the complaint, then you
[58:22.600 --> 58:28.720]  file it above them in court. You understand that? Well, you better watch out. You better
[58:28.720 --> 58:33.760]  watch out because in a lot of areas like that, let me tell you who delivers the drugs. And
[58:33.760 --> 58:37.440]  it looks like you're dealing with some really dangerous officers. You can either bow to
[58:37.440 --> 58:47.440]  them, move out or get ready for war. This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio

[01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:34.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're now into hour number two. Thank you so much for joining
[01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:39.440]  us. I know XM joins us in the second two hours. And of course all the listeners are out there.

[01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:49.040]  a ton of breaking important news today from around the world. 800-259-9231. Monsanto has
[01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:53.800]  now had the Monsanto Protection Act written by them, signed by Obama. We're going to break
[01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:54.800]  that down.
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:57.960]  We're going to break down the latest geopolitical. And as the banks prepare to take even more
[01:00:57.960 --> 01:01:01.680]  money out of European people's bank accounts to pay foreign banks, just give them all their
[01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:05.560]  money. It's not even owed. So total criminality by the global is just all out in the open
[01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:10.960]  about to get 100 times worse, we let it. That's all coming up in the global homeland security

[01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:20.440]  by design of you and your family proceeds according to plan, but you don't struggle
[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:21.440]  too much.
[01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:25.560]  All right. I for one think we might want to raise the alarm bells and find our soul and
[01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:31.080]  our backbone again and reverse the criminal tide and continue the long march towards humanity's
[01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:44.360]  ultimate destiny. Mikey in Chicago. You're on the air, Mikey. Hey, Mikey. Hey, hey, hey.
[01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:46.280]  Come on down, Mikey.
[01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:50.960]  Gold Coast, Chicago. You know, I'm not living in a place a lot of people down in Texas would
[01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:52.080]  want to be at right now.
[01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:57.080]  I know we're on 1530 there and a lot of great people in Chicago have been up there quite
[01:01:57.080 --> 01:02:01.160]  a few times, but it is sad that the criminal government is collapsing your society and
[01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:06.600]  will not prosecute murderers and that the mafia likes it like that. They can kill anybody
[01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:10.660]  they want. Get away with it. Now I have 15 questions. I know I can't get to them all,
[01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:11.660]  but I have three.
[01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:17.040]  Whatever happened to Justin in the first film? Whatever happened to who? Justin, the young
[01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:23.080]  boy that you kind of interrogated there in the school. It wasn't a school. It was a college.
[01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:29.400]  You're talking about the U.N. U.N. program where they brainwashed the college and high
[01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:33.600]  school students, the Model U.N. I don't know. I went to Model U.N., covered it, woke the
[01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:37.440]  guy up about the tyranny of the U.N. and said, go fight for liberty. I would like to know
[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:39.640]  what happened to him. That's interesting question.
[01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:45.600]  OK, number two, when you first started this, Alex, back in early in your career, did your
[01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:48.560]  family or friends begin to disown you?
[01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:54.240]  No, my family. My family knew a lot of history, so they didn't think it was as bad as I thought.
[01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:59.280]  Some of my family knew more than I knew because they'd worked in government or they'd been
[01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:05.060]  in Vietnam or, you know, seen things. I mean, I had some family that said, boy, you're lucky
[01:03:05.060 --> 01:03:09.840]  you're not getting killed, but you're dead on what you're saying. Stuff like that.
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:15.640]  On GMO, sir, there's a what Robin O'Brien who wrote a book about unhealthy truth. Are
[01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:18.600]  you familiar with her?
[01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:23.360]  Rings a little bit of a bell. Well, we carry some of the best books on GMO at info store
[01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:24.360]  dot com.
[01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:29.600]  She has quite a testimonial in her book called The Unhealthy Truth. I just thought I would
[01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:30.600]  recommend her.
[01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:31.600]  Sounds good.
[01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:32.600]  Go ahead. I'm sorry.
[01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:34.600]  No, go ahead. Sounds good.
[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:39.440]  Oh, and then some people I want to recommend to be on your show, maybe you tried to get
[01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:44.420]  them on. I'm not sure. It's like Ross Perot and Louis Farrakhan. I think a lot of demonization
[01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:45.640]  goes out to Louis.
[01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:50.880]  Hey, guys, I must say this right now. I want Ross Perot. I've said that before and we tried.
[01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:55.520]  I'm sure we have. I want Ross Perot. I want Louis Farrakhan. We try to John Brown talk
[01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:58.320]  to their people two weeks ago and he said he's interested when he gets back from the
[01:03:58.320 --> 01:03:59.320]  Caribbean.
[01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:04.600]  Stay on it. And yeah, just send us emails of who you recommend. Absolutely. I want to
[01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:09.440]  get them on the show. I want to get this. I want to contact these congressmen. Chris,
[01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:12.560]  go after the congressmen that are saying they're going to start an investigation. There's another
[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:15.360]  article out on today over the guns.
[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:22.840]  Over the bullets and guns and armored vehicles. Anything else, sir? No, no. See people. I
[01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:27.640]  think people are losing the skill. You watch like Fox News or CNN. People talk back and
[01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:31.720]  forth. But nowadays, those people, if they do talk, they kind of talk for like five minutes
[01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:33.000]  and then you're supposed to talk.
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:39.280]  We're like going back and forth, bro. Go ahead. As far as guns, I always thought it was a
[01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:44.000]  good idea for all our society in America to keep our guns because I don't hear people
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:48.400]  bringing it up a lot. But it just seems like if we ever invaded, here we are. Sure. Farmers
[01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:52.600]  are citizens. I mean, that's a deterrent. No, you're right, brother. It's a great point.
[01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:56.600]  God bless you. No, it's good that only the government have the guns. And that was like
[01:04:56.600 --> 01:05:01.680]  Nazi Germany. That's a good idea. You're actually wrong.
[01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:05.680]  Devastating events like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes or the threat of martial
[01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:10.760]  law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies. As a result, millions
[01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:15.920]  are stockpiling food, gold and weapons. But how will these items help if you or one of
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:21.120]  your loved ones becomes ill? Supernatural Silver is the ultimate tool to prepare you

[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:05.440]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even if I had a
[01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:10.320]  pretty good sized meal, that I was still starving. And my research led me to a well known fact
[01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:14.540]  that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the
[01:06:14.540 --> 01:06:19.940]  industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals
[01:06:19.940 --> 01:06:25.240]  and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer and be
[01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:30.780]  healthy. I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered

[01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:29.240]  Violence to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones. Words like violence break the
[01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:39.560]  silence. Well, my goal is to come crashing into your little world because the globalist,
[01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:45.120]  the technocrats, the social engineers, the mind warfare experts want you in a little
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:50.680]  world. They want you to not realize your destiny. They don't want you to realize how powerful
[01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:55.600]  and how beautiful and how good you are. The fact that you can paint, the fact that you
[01:08:55.600 --> 01:09:00.480]  can love, the fact that you can help others, the fact that you can recognize the beauty
[01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:08.880]  of the full moon last night with the clouds and the smell of spring. The fact that you
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:13.840]  can build is beautiful. Madison Avenue tells you you're ugly, tells you you're stunted,
[01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:19.280]  tells you you're bad, so they can sell you their fraud and sell you their lie. They want
[01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:26.980]  you psychically and spiritually crippled so that they can sell you the prosthesis by which
[01:09:26.980 --> 01:09:28.280]  they enslave you.
[01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:33.840]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, this is teleprompter free radio and TV. We're streaming video at

[01:09:39.420 --> 01:09:42.840]  but I said I wanna go through a lot of phone calls. We're gonna go to those first, then
[01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:47.800]  get into Monsanto and the Monsanto Protection Act that Obama has signed, the huge military
[01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:53.000]  police state world news, more bank runs, more money to be taken out of people's accounts,
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:59.240]  panic in Cyprus, the globalist president to take our money, the new world order, eugenics
[01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:02.840]  design, agenda 21, we're gonna break it all down.
[01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:06.640]  We're now into hour number two. Let's go to your phone calls, toll free number to join
[01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:13.280]  us, 800-259-9231. Gene in Oklahoma, you're on the air, welcome.
[01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:14.280]  Hey, Alex.
[01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:15.280]  Hello, my friend.
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:16.280]  Can you hear me?
[01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:17.280]  Yes, sir.
[01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:21.600]  Alex, man, we got chemtrailed like crazy this morning in Oklahoma, bad.
[01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:28.000]  Yeah, but for those that don't know, Obama and his science czar and Al Gore and all
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:32.840]  of them, but Al Gore says the program's crazy. Can you guys queue up Al Gore says chemtrails,
[01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:38.120]  I think the quote's crazy for like a month ago. We played it. They are and have been
[01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:44.040]  since the guy got a Nobel Prize in 1992.
[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:46.720]  You can pull it up, we've got a whole file on it, started making a film on it, it was
[01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:50.100]  so big, never got to it. That's something's gonna come out in the future. One of the projects
[01:10:50.100 --> 01:10:54.140]  that's waiting there derelict just to have the infrastructure and crew and energy to
[01:10:54.140 --> 01:11:00.900]  do it. The whole chemtrail geoengineering terraforming operation has been going on with
[01:11:00.900 --> 01:11:05.940]  electromagnetic antennas, with spraying, and it's all admitted at universities in tens
[01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:12.160]  of thousands of documents, Department of Energy, aerosol, weather modification, all admitted.
[01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:16.520]  But we use the word chemtrail back when they denied it. And so still, none of the public
[01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:20.600]  even knows it's real. And it's a conspiracy theory, just like the 2 billion bullets is
[01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:25.440]  a conspiracy theory, just like the armored vehicles are a conspiracy theory, just like
[01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:27.720]  world governments a conspiracy theory.
[01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:31.880]  Because it's announced by the G20 three years ago that world government is now official
[01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:37.800]  under SDRs with a 100 trillion every decade global tax to be paid to them. And Al Gore
[01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:42.220]  says there is no carbon tax, but he officially called for it last week while saying it didn't
[01:11:42.220 --> 01:11:44.000]  exist in a psych warfare program.
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:48.840]  If you pull up algor.com or org or whatever it is with his open call, and they did find
[01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:53.720]  the video from Ellen DeGeneres as well where he admitted the program and he disagrees with
[01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:58.580]  it. Bill Gates, of course, is running the program. He gets paid taxpayer money to chemtrail
[01:11:58.580 --> 01:11:59.580]  you.
[01:11:59.580 --> 01:12:02.140]  Don't believe that, just look it up. I'm sorry, sir, you mentioned chemtrails. I'm gonna give
[01:12:02.140 --> 01:12:06.600]  people a data factoid salvo, go ahead.
[01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:10.720]  Well now there's four lines over me, they're just new four lines now. And they're spreading
[01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:14.480]  out to make this cloud scene that's covering the whole state now.
[01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:20.760]  Yeah, no, no, I got home last night at about 1030. Dave Mustaine, his wife and family up
[01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:25.400]  at the airport, they're staying out at the house. And he might be on the show, he's here
[01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:28.080]  doing some other stuff with me, but he says he wants to do an interview, so we'll see
[01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:29.080]  what happens.
[01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:31.600]  I'm not gonna push him to do it. We may do some shooting or something, I'm not sure.
[01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:38.080]  But Dave's out here staying with me till Monday. Of course, Megadeth and Metallica, not name
[01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:40.480]  dropping, just letting folks know he may be coming on the show.
[01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:46.880]  When he comes to town, we hang out, really smart guy, and his new album's coming up.
[01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:52.560]  But the point is that I walked out last night, I got home at like 10 o'clock and I was walking
[01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:58.080]  back outside with the dogs. And I looked up and it was solid chem drills, solid aerosol,
[01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:00.420]  didn't dissipate, an hour later it was there.
[01:13:00.420 --> 01:13:05.160]  You can see it misting and forming all the clouds with the moon, so it was pretty spectacular.
[01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:09.040]  But hey, it's all right, it's an admitted program, it's killing the soil and killing
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:13.200]  microbes that are healthy. And that's okay, cuz it doesn't exist, everything's fine. Eat
[01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:17.400]  some GMO, get brain cancer, and give the Earth over to the globalist.
[01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:21.880]  Well, Alex, I appreciate you, you're a true patriot, man.
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:27.000]  I'm just trying to survive, brother, you know, I always say don't thank me. I just want a
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:31.540]  future. And again, thank you, God bless you for listening and being involved, sir. It's
[01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:33.400]  so humbling, I appreciate your call.
[01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:40.040]  I was driving back in from the airport, that's where I live out in the countryside. Pulled
[01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:43.320]  into this little barbecue place right as it was closing, but they let us come in. And
[01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:47.400]  that was one family in there, they were all listeners. And in fact, the fellow said he
[01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:51.240]  sent us an article a while back, we didn't post, and I'd met the guy before, he put some
[01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:54.680]  phone lines in out of my house.
[01:13:54.680 --> 01:14:00.040]  And so I forgot to tell Rob to look for his article. It was on the Philosopher Hagel,
[01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:04.640]  The Theory of Movement, I think's the headline. He said he'd send it again last night. And
[01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:07.640]  if it's a good article, the guy seems smart, I talked to him about ten minutes. Anyways,
[01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:13.240]  I'm going in there to talk to them and he had that info. It's just so humbling to run
[01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:14.920]  into people that are so awake out there.
[01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:24.800]  But why did I start telling the barbecue story? It doesn't matter. Let's talk to Raymond in
[01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:28.800]  Miami, Florida. Go ahead, sir, you're on the air.
[01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:40.240]  I'm doing Ali's first time call, a long time listener. How do they refer to it as FEMA
[01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:41.240]  Region 4?
[01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:47.200]  Yes, you're calling in from FEMA Region 4, formerly the United States, yes. A foreign
[01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:55.560]  banker, OECD, UN, Organization of Economic Cooperative Development, XM, securitized Concord
[01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:56.560]  Region.
[01:14:56.560 --> 01:15:04.000]  Yes, sir, absolutely. But I'm calling on behalf of all patriots, all true soldiers and representatives
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:09.520]  of this free nation, this republic that was founded by great people who believed in freedom,
[01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:15.080]  free markets, and the opportunity for everyone to have a good future. I'm calling on behalf
[01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:20.600]  of all those who are aware and awake to what's going on by these global and so-called elite.
[01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:23.520]  I don't even refer to them as elite because that gives them a public school that they
[01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:24.520]  haven't deserved.
[01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:27.240]  No, I mean, I refer to them as pig demons.
[01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:32.280]  Yeah, I refer to them as scum. You know, the words that I refer to them as, I really can't
[01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:35.080]  say because I know you have, you know-
[01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:43.080]  What they are, sir, is what Bob Marley called them. They are the vampires of Babylon.
[01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:47.800]  Absolutely, I definitely agree.
[01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:53.520]  They are psychic vampires and physical vampires. They don't grow fang teeth and they don't
[01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:57.960]  burn up in the sunshine. I mean, these people are vampires, though. All the legends, the
[01:15:57.960 --> 01:16:02.240]  legends are just a manifestation of what they really are.
[01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:05.880]  Yes, sir, they are energy vampires. They are-
[01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:10.440]  Look, the legends in every culture are the rich guys live in a castle and grab our kids
[01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:14.940]  at night and eat them. And then Bram Stroker called it, you know, Dracula and put it into
[01:16:14.940 --> 01:16:20.000]  that composite. But people just said they're basically, don't get near the castle, don't
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:25.400]  live near the castle and hide at night because they come to eat you. And then that's psychopaths.
[01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:29.680]  The elite like to kill people. They like to kill kids. Sorry, go ahead.
[01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:34.600]  Well, I'd like everybody to know that I'm the father of a nine-month-old, unvaccinated,
[01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:40.040]  very beautiful, very healthy baby girl. And if anyone really wants to know what's going
[01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:45.320]  on in the world and really wants to be aware, this man you are listening to is on the front
[01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:50.320]  lines. Whether you agree with everything he does or not is irrelevant because you'll
[01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:55.400]  never agree with everyone on everything. But if you do the research and actually go find
[01:16:55.400 --> 01:17:00.360]  out if these dots are connected that this man has been telling us for over 15 years,
[01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:05.720]  then you will see that everything is correct and all we need to do is join forces. Everyone
[01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:12.160]  who believes in humanity and love and respect and freedom for every human being on the planet,
[01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:17.440]  please combine your forces. Please everyone come together and join this network of human
[01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:18.440]  beings.
[01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:24.300]  Absolutely. And we've all got to pray to God to make us stronger during this time because
[01:17:24.300 --> 01:17:25.800]  this is going to be a great challenge.
[01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:31.040]  Yes, sir. And the main last thing I wanted to say is everyone please be aware of another
[01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:35.800]  false flag attack. They are demonizing patriots. They're demonizing anyone who believes in
[01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:39.880]  freedom, whether it's gun rights, freedom of speech, anything else. Please be aware
[01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:44.160]  of that. Absolutely, absolutely. God bless you, sir. And by the way, I just realized
[01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:47.400]  I used to look at this camera mainly, but I like sitting here looking at this camera.
[01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:51.960]  The clock is over there. Can we move it? Cuz I can't really see this one down in the dark.
[01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:56.260]  Can we move that clock over there? Cuz I've seen on YouTube. Why is Alex always looking
[01:17:56.260 --> 01:18:02.020]  over to his right? Is somebody telling him something? No, I'm looking at the clock. Maybe
[01:18:02.020 --> 01:18:05.200]  you guys can aim the document cam over there so they can see I'm looking at the clock.
[01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:08.240]  And it's always distracting me having to look over at the clock and then it becomes a whole
[01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:14.840]  new conspiracy theory that the Illuminati is over there giving me orders. Man, sometimes
[01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:19.640]  I wish I was being given orders. I tell you what, being in charge of things is a mighty,
[01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:22.640]  mighty responsibility. It was great hearing from that gentleman. You can just feel the
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:26.920]  love in his heart and the sense of justice and just the hope of goodness.
[01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:30.520]  But then the world's so evil, you end up wanting to use the corrupt tactics to beat it, but
[01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:36.260]  then you just become it. And I think our main mission is just to get people to realize how
[01:18:36.260 --> 01:18:43.160]  serious this new world order is. And understand that none of us are coming out of this. I
[01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:49.800]  mean, this thing has come to kill everybody. And a lot of you wanna get into death and
[01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:56.160]  wear a bunch of skulls and feel all powerful because really you're afraid of it.
[01:18:56.160 --> 01:19:00.280]  It's kind of like a Stockholm syndrome to the devil. The ultimate Stockholm syndrome,
[01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:04.600]  Satanic Stockholm syndrome. So many people I've discovered who are into darkness and
[01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:12.000]  manipulating people from a dark perspective are actually very, very weak, scared people.
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:18.280]  And they're so scared of darkness and death, and they're so weak that they like moths to
[01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:22.960]  the black flame of Satan, think they're gonna get power out of it.
[01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:28.360]  And they are just incredibly weak. And in the past, I had an instinct to wanna chop
[01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:36.280]  them up, basically. But that's not my instinct now. I believe even most of them can be reached.
[01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:42.080]  It's not very many, but the very high priest of the new world order who are really totally
[01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:47.200]  committed to this. And they themselves are not really Satanists, they're Luciferians
[01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:51.160]  and believe they're gonna become God after they merge with the machines.
[01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:55.160]  And there's another camp that believes they're gonna merge with the genetic template. There's
[01:19:55.160 --> 01:20:01.080]  two branches of the new world order trying to achieve technocratic godhood.
[01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:06.960]  Introducing Pro One, all of your filtration in one system portable on the go. No more

[01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:34.540]  We the people grow cotton, wheat fabric, engraving embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit
[01:22:34.540 --> 01:22:38.680]  and carting to a private bank, having it lead back at interest, forcing taxes to service
[01:22:38.680 --> 01:22:42.760]  debt. This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public
[01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:46.040]  currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army.
[01:22:46.040 --> 01:22:49.580]  Hi, Ted Anderson. I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary
[01:22:49.580 --> 01:22:57.360]  system. Call for your copy, 800-686-2237. It's time to understand the system. Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:57.360 --> 01:23:04.600]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:09.720]  Focus about what comes next. Next is the feeling of vulnerability you get after you arrive
[01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:14.780]  home to discover your house has been ransacked by burglars. Fool the bad guys with a new
[01:23:14.780 --> 01:23:21.860]  improved fake TV. You asked for it. We listened and we made our new fake TV three times brighter
[01:23:21.860 --> 01:23:26.260]  than our previous model. The brightness of our new fake TV is equivalent to a 40 inch
[01:23:26.260 --> 01:23:32.820]  TV. It simulates the color and motion of a real TV while you're away from home. And when
[01:23:32.820 --> 01:23:37.380]  burglars think someone is home watching television, they're likely to pass your house and move
[01:23:37.380 --> 01:23:43.900]  on to an easier target. The new brighter fake TV is only $39.95 and includes free shipping.
[01:23:43.900 --> 01:23:57.360]  Go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5FAKETV. That's 877-532-5388 or go to faketv.com. Fake TV,
[01:23:57.360 --> 01:24:24.360]  The Burglar Deterrent.
[01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:38.680]  That's the question. Can we not destroy ourselves? Yeah, the government says they're above the
[01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:54.100]  law. They tell us that they're above the law, but that we shouldn't be able to have guns
[01:24:54.100 --> 01:24:58.900]  or private property or raise our children. It's just all ridiculous how much we put up
[01:24:58.900 --> 01:25:06.660]  with by increments. Let's go ahead and talk to Bill in Illinois. Big news breakdown coming
[01:25:06.660 --> 01:25:10.460]  up after I go to this next battery of calls. Bill, you're on the air. You're watching via
[01:25:10.460 --> 01:25:12.900]  prisonplanet.tv. Go ahead.
[01:25:12.900 --> 01:25:19.980]  Hey, first time caller. I have some weird stuff going on in my life. I ended up, I don't
[01:25:19.980 --> 01:25:26.420]  know if you get talk about electronic harassment or gang stalking or that kind of thing when
[01:25:26.420 --> 01:25:38.420]  maybe you pissed off someone politically. But I was being a little outspoken about Patriot
[01:25:38.420 --> 01:25:48.140]  Act and NDAA and some stuff I didn't agree with. I ended up getting drugged. Some weird
[01:25:48.140 --> 01:25:56.900]  stuff happened in my area and some stuff was stolen from my house possibly to blackmail
[01:25:56.900 --> 01:26:03.380]  me with. And I have every reason to believe that the government's behind it.
[01:26:03.380 --> 01:26:09.180]  Well look, I mean, let me explain what's going on here. There are a lot of drugs in the food
[01:26:09.180 --> 01:26:13.580]  and the water and the culture. The culture is in crisis. There's general mind control
[01:26:13.580 --> 01:26:18.540]  going on. There's general evil. Society is degenerating. That's why the whole world is
[01:26:18.540 --> 01:26:23.780]  full of ruins of civilizations that existed and fell apart.
[01:26:23.780 --> 01:26:28.620]  Because people become lazy, they become delusional, they become paranoid. And it doesn't mean
[01:26:28.620 --> 01:26:32.780]  that there isn't real forces going on. Your iPhone spying on you, your computer spying
[01:26:32.780 --> 01:26:37.480]  on you, but no one's ever worried about that. They're always worried that people are looking
[01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:41.420]  at them. And then a lot of it is if you're looking paranoid in front of the cops, they're
[01:26:41.420 --> 01:26:45.860]  all gonna mess with you. If you're looking paranoid in front of people in businesses,
[01:26:45.860 --> 01:26:47.300]  they're gonna come up and mess with you.
[01:26:47.300 --> 01:26:51.560]  And then you're going to think everyone is after you. But if you are in a super good
[01:26:51.560 --> 01:26:56.480]  mood and super happy and telling jokes and stuff and you're not married, you're gonna
[01:26:56.480 --> 01:27:00.800]  have women coming up to you. So so much of it is how you act and what you expect. Now
[01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:04.460]  there are cases where let's say you catch police stealing drugs in your area.
[01:27:04.460 --> 01:27:08.140]  They'll start pulling you over all the time. They'll plant drugs on you and put you in
[01:27:08.140 --> 01:27:11.740]  jail. I've seen that happen with people. I grew up in Dallas and watched that go on.
[01:27:11.740 --> 01:27:17.260]  So there are times, if you're pretty prominent, you can get messed with. They messed with
[01:27:17.260 --> 01:27:22.300]  Hemingway because he was starting to lean towards communist. He wasn't a bad guy. He
[01:27:22.300 --> 01:27:25.980]  was misguided, but also very smart. So they did mess with him and then got people to say
[01:27:25.980 --> 01:27:31.780]  he was crazy and then committed him and electroshocked him basically till they did fry his brain.
[01:27:31.780 --> 01:27:36.700]  And later it came out, it was a COINTELPRO psyop. But I don't think you're Ernest Hemingway.
[01:27:36.700 --> 01:27:41.660]  See, I've had him with me call up and say we're gonna kill you and your family and you
[01:27:41.660 --> 01:27:44.980]  were just talking about this. And I go, well, that's in God's hand. And that's a psyop back
[01:27:44.980 --> 01:27:49.820]  on them because I'm committed. I'm like a kamikaze in the info war, okay? All that does
[01:27:49.820 --> 01:27:51.700]  is give me more energy, okay?
[01:27:51.700 --> 01:27:56.540]  So they tried psyops with me. I'm not Ernest Hemingway, okay? And so what I'm telling you
[01:27:56.540 --> 01:28:00.260]  is, sir, because the atmosphere is so crazy, there are a lot of people that were already
[01:28:00.260 --> 01:28:05.380]  borderline schizophrenic that then get messed with or have a problem in their life. Or there's
[01:28:05.380 --> 01:28:08.260]  just crime, society's breaking down.
[01:28:08.260 --> 01:28:13.140]  And then you then think they're coming after you. They don't have the forces to do that.
[01:28:13.140 --> 01:28:18.920]  They try to announce they're spying on everybody to scare you in a panopticon psychology system.
[01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:23.000]  Look up panopticon, okay, to where you believe you're being watched all the time when you're
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:27.500]  really not. Now they are watching all the time, but they can't access it even with super
[01:28:27.500 --> 01:28:30.060]  computers because a human has to interpret it.
[01:28:30.060 --> 01:28:34.900]  And what are they gonna act against? We are the majority. So get past your fear. I'm gonna
[01:28:34.900 --> 01:28:37.540]  tell you right now, sir, do you believe in God?
[01:28:37.540 --> 01:28:39.980]  Off and on.
[01:28:39.980 --> 01:28:46.300]  But just listen, believe in God, believe in justice, okay? And ask God to give you protection
[01:28:46.300 --> 01:28:52.660]  because believe me, it's real. Ask God to show you your guardian angel. You have nothing
[01:28:52.660 --> 01:28:56.180]  to worry about, buddy, even if they kill you. You are with-
[01:28:56.180 --> 01:28:58.380]  Well, they've threatened to.
[01:28:58.380 --> 01:29:03.900]  Okay, really, somebody's called up and said, I'm gonna kill you. I can't hear you. Go ahead,
[01:29:03.900 --> 01:29:04.900]  sir.
[01:29:04.900 --> 01:29:05.900]  Talking to your telephone.
[01:29:05.900 --> 01:29:15.060]  Sorry, sorry. Someone walked up to me, was following me around, just doing weird things,
[01:29:15.060 --> 01:29:16.060]  following me through a building.
[01:29:16.060 --> 01:29:19.500]  Well, there are a lot of crazy people all over the place, sir. Society's breaking down.
[01:29:19.500 --> 01:29:21.940]  I mean, if you're walking around in somebody's yard, they're gonna come out and ask what
[01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:28.300]  you're doing. Listen, stop acting paranoid. See, people always accuse me of being paranoid.
[01:29:28.300 --> 01:29:32.700]  I'm the opposite. I know what's going on. I'm in their face. I'm walking around, no
[01:29:32.700 --> 01:29:38.100]  bodyguards, no nothing. I'm the opposite of that. I know what's going on. They use paranoia
[01:29:38.100 --> 01:29:43.340]  and intimidation to make us all scared. The wicked flee when none pursue. You're not wicked,
[01:29:43.340 --> 01:29:50.420]  my friend. Don't flee. We'll be right back with more calls. Stay with us.
[01:29:50.420 --> 01:30:01.140]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:30:06.180 --> 01:30:11.860]  economic system runs from bad to worse. The globalist model is to shut down societies
[01:30:11.860 --> 01:30:17.020]  and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover. That's why we've assembled

[01:33:38.620 --> 01:33:43.980]  through Friday, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Back weeknights, 7 o'clock, M4 Wars Nightly News. Back weekends
[01:33:43.980 --> 01:33:51.580]  4 to 6 p.m. Central. All right, let me do this. Callers are all over the map. That's
[01:33:51.580 --> 01:33:59.340]  fine with me. But I do want to try to get to some of the news issues here. And when
[01:33:59.340 --> 01:34:06.100]  I say first time callers, wide open phones, any topic, it does take us in a wildcard direction.
[01:34:06.100 --> 01:34:09.180]  And so that's why I do it. But I just want to keep each caller about a minute and a half
[01:34:09.180 --> 01:34:12.340]  now. I'll take five or six more, and then I've got to get into all the economic news,
[01:34:12.340 --> 01:34:18.700]  the police state news, the Monsanto Protection Act that Obama has signed. That's up at Infowars.com
[01:34:18.700 --> 01:34:22.380]  with Mike Adams, the health ranger, breaking that down. We're going to be going over all
[01:34:22.380 --> 01:34:26.300]  of it. Let's get Mike Adams on the next few days, either via Skype or in studio if he
[01:34:26.300 --> 01:34:29.680]  can do it to break down this bill. I've gone over it, but I want to talk about how big
[01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:37.020]  this is. Just amazing. Just absolutely amazing when I get into that. But right now, let's
[01:34:37.020 --> 01:34:40.380]  go to Roger in Nevada. You're on the air, sir.
[01:34:40.380 --> 01:34:46.140]  Yes, Alex. I'm a first time caller. I just want to say you're a true American patriot.
[01:34:46.140 --> 01:34:51.300]  And I like the way you do your program. Also, it's an honor and a privilege to be on the
[01:34:51.300 --> 01:34:52.300]  air.
[01:34:52.300 --> 01:34:54.340]  Please don't take me from the Silver State, brother.
[01:34:54.340 --> 01:35:00.020]  Well, I always want to compliment you because I've been listening to you for the last three
[01:35:00.020 --> 01:35:06.020]  months, and I learned a lot from you. And what I do is I take that out and I fight the
[01:35:06.020 --> 01:35:09.460]  spiritual warfare like with you. I fight to know what order of Christ like we do it stand
[01:35:09.460 --> 01:35:14.560]  right beside you. I want to let you know that. And I learned a lot from yesterday's program
[01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:21.460]  about the Catholic Church who are trying to disarm America and also Franklin Graham.
[01:35:21.460 --> 01:35:25.860]  There needs to be major pushback to Franklin Graham, the Southern Baptist Convention, the
[01:35:25.860 --> 01:35:30.620]  official Catholic Church newspaper saying repeal the Second Amendment, take all the
[01:35:30.620 --> 01:35:38.180]  guns. I mean, man, I mean, that is. And remember, the Vatican is its own country. That's a foreign
[01:35:38.180 --> 01:35:41.900]  country. And again, I don't have some thing against Catholics. Everybody knows that. I'm
[01:35:41.900 --> 01:35:47.260]  trying to bring everybody together, but that's they got something. The new pope wants a carbon
[01:35:47.260 --> 01:35:48.260]  tax.
[01:35:48.260 --> 01:35:52.900]  I mean, I'm sorry. I'm not going to pay Al Gore money because the pontiff says so. I
[01:35:52.900 --> 01:35:53.900]  mean, it's incredible.
[01:35:53.900 --> 01:35:58.660]  Absolutely. Yeah. Like it says in the Bible, there'll be a lot of false prophets, false
[01:35:58.660 --> 01:36:04.660]  prophets, whereas now the church ages last days and I was just going like, wow. And so
[01:36:04.660 --> 01:36:08.980]  I tell people about it, get people informed. It's like it says, it's finally traveling
[01:36:08.980 --> 01:36:13.820]  on, brother. And I'm telling you, I'm right with you. And it's like I said, it's the honor
[01:36:13.820 --> 01:36:15.620]  privilege to be on the air with you.
[01:36:15.620 --> 01:36:19.500]  And I just want to tell you to keep up the good work, tell your whole staff they're doing
[01:36:19.500 --> 01:36:22.460]  a good job. And also, I'd like to have you come out here and do a conference. And I'd
[01:36:22.460 --> 01:36:25.580]  also like to work with the staff, have you come out here and do one.
[01:36:25.580 --> 01:36:31.300]  I hear you, my friend. I appreciate your call. Let's go to Corey in Texas. You're on the
[01:36:31.300 --> 01:36:32.300]  air. Go ahead.
[01:36:32.300 --> 01:36:35.660]  Hey, Alex, I appreciate you taking the time to take my call.
[01:36:35.660 --> 01:36:40.180]  Please don't thank me. I'm not an egomaniac, narcissist. You don't need to thank me for
[01:36:40.180 --> 01:36:44.940]  taking your call. And I know you've got to beg screeners, beg the host with all the other
[01:36:44.940 --> 01:36:50.140]  shows, not mine. I appreciate you loving Liberty. Thank you for calling. Go ahead.
[01:36:50.140 --> 01:36:54.420]  I'm fighting for Liberty, brother. I plugged in this event. It's going to be a huge event.
[01:36:54.420 --> 01:36:59.900]  We got 14 speakers. It's out at the quick trip ballpark in Arlington or actually Grand
[01:36:59.900 --> 01:37:05.780]  Prairie, Texas. It's not this Saturday, but next we got Kathy Glass, David Simpson, Jay
[01:37:05.780 --> 01:37:09.900]  Stang from Oath Keepers, Terry Hall, Frank Kuchar, a list of Liberty lovers.
[01:37:09.900 --> 01:37:12.960]  Sure, just tell me the name of the event. What is it?
[01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:18.480]  It's called Standing Together for Liberty. And then how do you find details?
[01:37:18.480 --> 01:37:23.980]  You can go on Facebook if you like. I've emailed y'all's staff a couple of times. It's Saturday,
[01:37:23.980 --> 01:37:29.500]  April 6th at the quick trip ballpark. Absolutely. Well, listen, good to hear from you. What
[01:37:29.500 --> 01:37:34.140]  people should do is everyone in the country should be looking for Liberty events in their
[01:37:34.140 --> 01:37:40.300]  area. And it's up at the Daily Paul, so we just linked to that right there for everybody.
[01:37:40.300 --> 01:37:43.820]  It's impossible for us that we do plug a lot of stuff for people to sit there and promote
[01:37:43.820 --> 01:37:48.060]  the thousands of events going on every week. But everyone should just be looking for other
[01:37:48.060 --> 01:37:53.780]  Liberty lovers in their area. Okay, let's go to Alex in Chicago. You're on the air.
[01:37:53.780 --> 01:37:55.780]  Go ahead. Can you hear me?
[01:37:55.780 --> 01:37:59.340]  Yes, sir. How you doing, Alex? My name's also Alex.
[01:37:59.340 --> 01:38:02.780]  Alex, great name, means defender of mankind. I don't know if you knew that.
[01:38:02.780 --> 01:38:04.980]  Sure, I know what my name means. Sure, thank you.
[01:38:04.980 --> 01:38:10.100]  Yeah, I'm calling you from Chirac. That's what the police here call Chicago nowadays,
[01:38:10.100 --> 01:38:16.940]  Chirac. So I was calling, I'm pretty familiar with all this type of black ops and tie-ops
[01:38:16.940 --> 01:38:23.020]  stuff. I want to ask you though, how deep does the rabbit hole really go?
[01:38:23.020 --> 01:38:26.780]  How deep does the rabbit hole go in what respect?
[01:38:26.780 --> 01:38:31.060]  Tell me some stuff from the bottom of the rabbit hole. I know you get out there sometimes
[01:38:31.060 --> 01:38:37.340]  with alien stuff and supernatural stuff and religious stuff. Tell me some really out there
[01:38:37.340 --> 01:38:38.340]  stuff.
[01:38:38.340 --> 01:38:46.240]  Well, you know the Fleetwood Mac song. I forget the name of it where she goes, oh, here it
[01:38:46.240 --> 01:38:54.640]  comes again, the crystal vision. I keep my visions to myself. I can't get people to admit
[01:38:54.640 --> 01:38:58.140]  that there's 2 billion bullets they bought, that we're going into a classic police state,
[01:38:58.140 --> 01:39:03.020]  that they're spying on us without warrants when it's all admitted.
[01:39:03.020 --> 01:39:07.540]  That our government's running Al-Qaeda publicly worldwide, and they admit it and put out white
[01:39:07.540 --> 01:39:12.820]  papers at the Council on Foreign Relations, our real government, corporate government,
[01:39:12.820 --> 01:39:18.220]  saying we need Al-Qaeda. That's a quote four months ago in their white paper admitting
[01:39:18.220 --> 01:39:21.440]  they run it. This is the type of stuff we're talking about.
[01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:26.620]  So we're on a planet two-thirds of the way out on the spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy
[01:39:26.620 --> 01:39:31.540]  with hundreds of billions of photograph galaxies, and now hundreds of billions past those. And
[01:39:31.540 --> 01:39:35.900]  they're now finding clusters of hundreds of billions of galaxies past those where there's
[01:39:35.900 --> 01:39:40.160]  hundreds of billions of hundreds of billions of hundreds of billions of whole clusters
[01:39:40.160 --> 01:39:41.620]  of galaxies.
[01:39:41.620 --> 01:39:46.740]  And so we're here able to consciously recognize this, able to consciously build technology
[01:39:46.740 --> 01:39:51.060]  that can see this. And we're able to, the most important thing we can do is recognize
[01:39:51.060 --> 01:39:56.700]  wholesomeness and recognize beauty, and recognize the beauty of the sound of the sea. That is
[01:39:56.700 --> 01:40:02.820]  the connection of the universe. That is the beginning of understanding what our true potential
[01:40:02.820 --> 01:40:10.660]  is, is that we are sentient, conscious beings with souls who can commune with God.
[01:40:10.660 --> 01:40:15.060]  And the evidence of God is in the firmament, it is in the stars, okay? And I'm not trying
[01:40:15.060 --> 01:40:19.980]  to get religious here, folks, but people need to understand, transcend the New World Order,
[01:40:19.980 --> 01:40:24.900]  transcend it, okay? There is and are dark entities in the universe, that's undoubtable.
[01:40:24.900 --> 01:40:29.880]  There are forces of darkness that loved ugly things, and loved piles of dead children,
[01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:34.900]  and rotten meat, and planets that are dead, and darkness, okay? And then we don't like
[01:40:34.900 --> 01:40:35.900]  that, okay?
[01:40:35.900 --> 01:40:40.060]  You can say whatever you want, it's there, okay, looking at us. We want to go with the
[01:40:40.060 --> 01:40:45.580]  regenerative life, okay? And if you look at the New World Order, what flows out of it?
[01:40:45.580 --> 01:40:49.740]  How it loves us, how it loves life, how it's sweet, how it's cute, but it's pure lies,
[01:40:49.740 --> 01:40:56.260]  pure deception, pure death. So at the bottom of the rabbit hole is death and the end of
[01:40:56.260 --> 01:41:01.540]  life and darkness forever, absolute zero.
[01:41:01.540 --> 01:41:06.900]  The center of hell is frozen. It's frozen in Dante's Inferno, but I don't need to read
[01:41:06.900 --> 01:41:14.460]  Dante's Inferno. My soul looking out into studying evil and studying good, it is absolute
[01:41:14.460 --> 01:41:22.740]  zero. It is devoid of heat, of life, of everything. Okay, that's the bottom of the rabbit hole.
[01:41:22.740 --> 01:41:29.020]  Absolute raw power against creation, against God. The devil hates life. All those that
[01:41:29.020 --> 01:41:35.460]  hate me love death, Christ said. All those that hate me love death. All those that hate
[01:41:35.460 --> 01:41:38.220]  me love death, that's it, death.
[01:41:38.220 --> 01:41:42.180]  Death is at the bottom. I appreciate your call. Any other questions?
[01:41:42.180 --> 01:41:49.980]  Yeah, I was wondering if you think that this whole technology aspect of how the governments
[01:41:49.980 --> 01:41:55.420]  are using technology to now kind of encapsulate and control people, do you think in the future
[01:41:55.420 --> 01:41:59.980]  that that technology, the same technology is going to backfire, such as-
[01:41:59.980 --> 01:42:03.660]  It's already backfiring. They don't care. I mean, in their literature, I have quotes
[01:42:03.660 --> 01:42:08.180]  of these top technocracy people, EU advisors, you name it, saying, we'll probably blow the
[01:42:08.180 --> 01:42:16.420]  earth up in our source of, to go on willing and to go on dominating. And then say, that's
[01:42:16.420 --> 01:42:23.320]  basically us just merging with power. And then Lenin dreamed of blowing up the earth
[01:42:23.320 --> 01:42:28.140]  and blowing up the solar system and he'd blow up the universe and blow up God if he could.
[01:42:28.140 --> 01:42:33.940]  It's just like, I'm a moth in the flame. Satan, I love you. I mean, it's just pathetic because
[01:42:33.940 --> 01:42:41.300]  they hate the creation force. I mean, those of us that love it absolutely love it and
[01:42:41.300 --> 01:42:47.820]  just like it's such a blessing. It's so good. It's so deep. It's so fathomless and incredible.
[01:42:47.820 --> 01:42:53.900]  But to these people, to these creatures, I appreciate your call. You know what's at the
[01:42:53.900 --> 01:43:01.380]  rabbit hole? At the bottom of the rabbit hole, right before you hit the bottom and total
[01:43:01.380 --> 01:43:04.860]  implosion and mass death, you see what you see in Japan.
[01:43:04.860 --> 01:43:08.380]  It's now taken over the whole culture. Bloomberg reported last year, I already knew about this,
[01:43:08.380 --> 01:43:11.420]  I never talked about it, but this is in Bloomberg, I'll talk about it. The number one seller
[01:43:11.420 --> 01:43:16.420]  in the country, outside of baby diapers, it's surpassed that as adult diapers, not for an
[01:43:16.420 --> 01:43:20.820]  aging population. Japanese that were always into cleanliness and the cleanest people in
[01:43:20.820 --> 01:43:26.840]  the world, they like to desecrate themselves and poop in their pants.
[01:43:26.840 --> 01:43:30.660]  And inventing machines everywhere. I was talking to Mancow about this, he goes to Japan twice
[01:43:30.660 --> 01:43:36.460]  a year for shows and things he does. And there's vending machines everywhere with, you've got
[01:43:36.460 --> 01:43:40.620]  kids listening, don't have them listening right now, with underwear with full loads
[01:43:40.620 --> 01:43:44.700]  of them. That's a baked potato fully loaded.
[01:43:44.700 --> 01:43:51.580]  And with a picture of the woman who did it. And supplanting the major bars everywhere,
[01:43:51.580 --> 01:43:56.700]  it will soon be the dominant bar, is bars where you go in and people defecate on you.
[01:43:56.700 --> 01:44:00.340]  Now that happened in Sodom and Gomorrah, it happened everywhere else. When you get to
[01:44:00.340 --> 01:44:06.380]  that point, the next point is mass human sacrifice, burning cities and total Satan worship. And
[01:44:06.380 --> 01:44:11.420]  then plagues and disease and everyone just stumbling around drinking blood.
[01:44:11.420 --> 01:44:17.380]  That's why everybody's into zombies now. And that's why cuz you know that's next, okay?
[01:44:17.380 --> 01:44:22.680]  It's happened hundreds of times in history. And now, poop bars are all over the United
[01:44:22.680 --> 01:44:28.280]  States and eating poop and you're not trendy if you don't do it and you're hurting people's
[01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:34.860]  civil rights. And HIV and AIDS is just exploding. And if you say that's really bad for the quote
[01:44:34.860 --> 01:44:35.860]  gay community.
[01:44:35.860 --> 01:44:39.580]  That's a destructive lifestyle. They say, you're just against me. Yeah, then I'm really
[01:44:39.580 --> 01:44:44.060]  shocked by the fact that you like the same sex. I can't handle it cuz I'm such a square.
[01:44:44.060 --> 01:44:51.700]  Yeah, no, I care about you and that you dredge a tree by its fruits. That is destructive.
[01:44:51.700 --> 01:44:56.080]  And heterosexuals are doing all that stuff too. I mean, this is and I hate to talk about
[01:44:56.080 --> 01:44:58.740]  stuff like that, but you asked what's at the bottom of the rabbit hole.
[01:44:58.740 --> 01:45:04.180]  You fall all the way down the pit and at the bottom for the general public, it's desecrating
[01:45:04.180 --> 01:45:08.660]  themselves and hurting their bodies and jabbing things through themselves. And that's what
[01:45:08.660 --> 01:45:12.660]  happened in every culture. Moses comes down from the mountain, everybody's dancing around
[01:45:12.660 --> 01:45:16.880]  cutting themselves and killing little kids and everything. I mean, it's the same deal.
[01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:20.720]  He's gone a couple days, comes back down, they're all devil worshiping, okay? I mean,
[01:45:20.720 --> 01:45:25.280]  that's what goes on. That's what happens. That's where it goes. That's where it leads.
[01:45:25.280 --> 01:45:29.580]  You ask where does the rabbit hole lead? It leads to human sacrifice, torture of children,
[01:45:29.580 --> 01:45:35.300]  genetic engineering monsters, babies being added to Pepsi as flavoring and it's just
[01:45:35.300 --> 01:45:41.460]  not even news. I go, okay, big deal. Yeah, you're wrong. It's cool to drink babies. It's
[01:45:41.460 --> 01:45:46.020]  cool that women go into the doctors and have melted down dead Chinese babies injected into
[01:45:46.020 --> 01:45:49.380]  their lips and suicide nets and mass Satanism.
[01:45:49.380 --> 01:45:55.860]  And you think by getting into it and agreeing with it, yeah, we're sick. Yeah, so what?
[01:45:55.860 --> 01:46:00.060]  You think you've got like power over it now and you just let that spiritual hand reach
[01:46:00.060 --> 01:46:04.900]  right out and wrap around you and it's just taking it right toward its mouth. It's got,
[01:46:04.900 --> 01:46:13.780]  oh yeah. And then it itself, a bigger demon just reaches down and grabs it, just bites
[01:46:13.780 --> 01:46:18.740]  right in. And that's what it's all about. Two globalists all hooked up with fake copies
[01:46:18.740 --> 01:46:23.940]  of themselves online in the big mega frames that aren't even real, delusions of themselves
[01:46:23.940 --> 01:46:26.540]  that they're eternal when all they've done is given up their humanity and their soul
[01:46:26.540 --> 01:46:28.360]  and spirit.
[01:46:28.360 --> 01:46:35.120]  Two global technocracies, two entities, two humanoids at the end of it, jacketed into
[01:46:35.120 --> 01:46:40.960]  giant technological systems with giant robot wars with each other, trying to defeat the
[01:46:40.960 --> 01:46:45.460]  other to be the one prime entity. That's at the bottom of the rabbit hole. It'll never
[01:46:45.460 --> 01:46:50.900]  get there because God will intervene before that. But not before you've seen where technocracy
[01:46:50.900 --> 01:46:57.380]  leads you, not before you've seen absolute hell on earth, not before you've begged.
[01:46:57.380 --> 01:47:05.180]  And the whole world's had an example of what all this does. Then humanity goes forward.
[01:47:05.180 --> 01:47:13.260]  That's what you get when you ask where the rabbit hole ends. Oh my gosh. John the Revelator
[01:47:13.260 --> 01:47:22.220]  marveled at the beast. He marveled. Marvel in that translation means his mouth hanging
[01:47:22.220 --> 01:47:23.220]  open.
[01:47:23.220 --> 01:47:27.660]  Imagine something 2,000 years ago, what we now see unfolding being beamed into their
[01:47:27.660 --> 01:47:31.420]  head. Here, some people have a warning. This is what's gonna happen. You imagine seeing
[01:47:31.420 --> 01:47:35.100]  all this and what's gonna happen and just rolling around on the ground for days like
[01:47:35.100 --> 01:47:36.100]  John did?
[01:47:36.100 --> 01:47:41.820]  It's just all beamed right into his brain. Let's go ahead and take another phone call.
[01:47:41.820 --> 01:47:45.860]  Jason in West Virginia, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[01:47:45.860 --> 01:47:47.500]  Hey, Alex.
[01:47:47.500 --> 01:47:48.500]  Welcome.
[01:47:48.500 --> 01:47:56.460]  Hey, man. Here last Saturday, me and my wife got arrested. We were shooting on farmland
[01:47:56.460 --> 01:48:02.300]  and next thing you know, these bunch of sheriffs the SWAT team pulled out of like 11 o'clock
[01:48:02.300 --> 01:48:03.300]  at night.
[01:48:03.300 --> 01:48:04.300]  What were you doing?
[01:48:04.300 --> 01:48:05.300]  Shooting guns.
[01:48:05.300 --> 01:48:09.180]  Yeah, that's what I thought you said. The phone popped. Nowadays, if you're even on
[01:48:09.180 --> 01:48:13.460]  your own land in Montana, the cops show up. Guns are evil. They're gonna teach you they're
[01:48:13.460 --> 01:48:18.460]  dirty and bad. So what happened? There's a purge. Homeland Security now admits they're
[01:48:18.460 --> 01:48:20.060]  aimed at gun owners.
[01:48:20.060 --> 01:48:22.780]  Homeland Security is not for Al-Qaeda, it's for you. Go ahead.
[01:48:22.780 --> 01:48:29.100]  They're sitting there saying that we can't wait for something to happen so we can repossess
[01:48:29.100 --> 01:48:33.480]  these guns. And I was like, man, what smart attitudes, you know?
[01:48:33.480 --> 01:48:38.260]  So you're in West Virginia, the cops show up. I mean, how big is the property? Where
[01:48:38.260 --> 01:48:39.260]  are you at?
[01:48:39.260 --> 01:48:41.260]  We're on 20 acres.
[01:48:41.260 --> 01:48:46.820]  Okay, I mean, did your neighbors complain? What's going on?
[01:48:46.820 --> 01:48:51.860]  Well, I don't know what happened. They've never explained anything to us.
[01:48:51.860 --> 01:48:58.140]  You were safely shooting at a shooting range, a berm? I mean, what was going on?
[01:48:58.140 --> 01:49:00.900]  We were shooting at hay bales.
[01:49:00.900 --> 01:49:05.340]  Yeah, listen, everybody I know out in the countryside where there's like 200 acre ranch
[01:49:05.340 --> 01:49:09.740]  sheds, 20 acre, 5 acre, I've got less than 10 acres, little bitty thing. I mean, the
[01:49:09.740 --> 01:49:14.300]  neighbors are all, I've talked to the neighbors, the cops come now when people shoot on 100
[01:49:14.300 --> 01:49:15.300]  acres.
[01:49:15.300 --> 01:49:20.940]  Cuz they've now built miles away some neighborhoods and the cops come in Texas and act like on
[01:49:20.940 --> 01:49:26.020]  100 acre, your own land. And my neighbors have got like a berm and hay bales and family
[01:49:26.020 --> 01:49:30.860]  comes and shoots. I talked to the other neighbor, who's actually a famous guy, and they've had
[01:49:30.860 --> 01:49:36.180]  trouble and it's just bizarre.
[01:49:36.180 --> 01:49:39.780]  But it's not bizarre. They are teaching us that we're bad. Go ahead.
[01:49:39.780 --> 01:49:44.940]  What I need to do, do you think I should get most of my guns out of my house and put them
[01:49:44.940 --> 01:49:46.820]  somewhere? Cuz I'm afraid they're gonna come raid my house.
[01:49:46.820 --> 01:49:53.020]  Well, listen, here's the deal. Well, I mean, let me think for a minute cuz I'm trying to
[01:49:53.020 --> 01:49:58.460]  give you this answer here cuz I don't know all your particulars. Here's the issue. If
[01:49:58.460 --> 01:50:01.980]  the cops had to show up cuz people were scared and called them cuz they think gunfire is
[01:50:01.980 --> 01:50:02.980]  illegal.
[01:50:02.980 --> 01:50:06.300]  Just like people call cops on you if you have a gun case in your house in Texas. I mean,
[01:50:06.300 --> 01:50:10.420]  you wonder why you get a SWAT team, right? The cable guy saw you had a AR-15 and so they
[01:50:10.420 --> 01:50:14.180]  SWAT team you. It's a legal AR-15. You're going to jail. They don't care. They'll find
[01:50:14.180 --> 01:50:17.620]  something. I see a rest in the news every day for what they call arsenals that are like
[01:50:17.620 --> 01:50:18.620]  he had 20 guns.
[01:50:18.620 --> 01:50:23.620]  Totally legal, veteran, go to jail. I mean, they take people's kids for not taking shots.
[01:50:23.620 --> 01:50:26.620]  There's no law. They don't care. They got a family court. They'll have that kid getting
[01:50:26.620 --> 01:50:30.980]  raped in a pedophile den by the next day. I mean, they're here to hurt America. They're
[01:50:30.980 --> 01:50:34.720]  here to kill you and your family. They're here to inject vaccines in you and kill your
[01:50:34.720 --> 01:50:37.740]  baby and then arrest you when they kill your baby.
[01:50:37.740 --> 01:50:42.540]  Even if the baby has a convulsion in the hospital, they're gonna put you in jail. Because they
[01:50:42.540 --> 01:50:46.600]  like it. Now, the others are just mindless idiots who don't even know and notice they're
[01:50:46.600 --> 01:50:50.420]  part of this. But you've got the evil ones there, the run and the team under them know
[01:50:50.420 --> 01:50:52.060]  full well what they're doing.
[01:50:52.060 --> 01:50:55.160]  So when we come back, I gotta talk to you, then I'll get to the news. Because you're
[01:50:55.160 --> 01:50:59.420]  sitting there talking about something very, very important here. The cops what they said
[01:50:59.420 --> 01:51:01.740]  it's that there were.
[01:51:01.740 --> 01:51:05.500]  If you're listening, you'd know your basic freedoms are being threatened every day. If
[01:51:05.500 --> 01:51:09.700]  you're listening, you'd know the economy is not getting better. You know, gas and food

[01:54:16.260 --> 01:54:19.940]  knowing people are breaking in your neighbor's house and you run up and are banging on their
[01:54:19.940 --> 01:54:23.140]  front door saying i see people breaking in the back your neighbor's like what are you
[01:54:23.140 --> 01:54:29.380]  so upset about i can't help get wound up here on air because i'm here warning millions of
[01:54:29.380 --> 01:54:40.460]  people about what's going on and it sounds crazy to say that they're killing kids all
[01:54:40.460 --> 01:54:44.740]  over america right now post abortion you know one year olds two year olds of vaccines but
[01:54:44.740 --> 01:54:48.020]  they kill a lot of them they don't just brain damage them and then they're going to put
[01:54:48.020 --> 01:54:52.940]  you in jail when they do the autopsy and your kids got blood on the brain and by the way
[01:54:52.940 --> 01:54:56.900]  those doctors see that stuff all the time those coroners they know the vaccine killed
[01:54:56.900 --> 01:55:03.020]  them they're gonna put you in jail because that's how they keep their job all cultures
[01:55:03.020 --> 01:55:08.220]  human sacrifice when they're under this spell every culture does it every culture does human
[01:55:08.220 --> 01:55:13.020]  sacrifice during this decline period during this part of the cycle and here they do it
[01:55:13.020 --> 01:55:18.060]  with abortion and then now you hear about the bioethics boards all over the country
[01:55:18.060 --> 01:55:24.300]  the death panels saying well a homeless guy came in who had a heart attack and we're not
[01:55:24.300 --> 01:55:27.940]  gonna give him surgery we're gonna let him die you see that in the news and they're like
[01:55:27.940 --> 01:55:33.300]  well maybe that's a good thing they're dehumanizing you the state troopers started pulling women
[01:55:33.300 --> 01:55:38.660]  over no evidence no nothing with dirty gloves going in their bodies the head of the state
[01:55:38.660 --> 01:55:43.180]  police said that's fine that's our new policy the grand jury said the law says you can't
[01:55:43.180 --> 01:55:46.820]  do that you're going to jail they've indicted them see but they were like hey that's nothing
[01:55:46.820 --> 01:55:51.420]  wrong with that and if we would have bought that psyop what do you do past sticking your
[01:55:51.420 --> 01:55:58.140]  hand with the same glove in multiple people inside their bodies you could see them with
[01:55:58.140 --> 01:56:04.820]  force raping a woman two women on the side of the road physically with their hand hates
[01:56:04.820 --> 01:56:10.180]  talk like that but see how they just you know the state police local captain and the commander
[01:56:10.180 --> 01:56:14.780]  said that's fine i approve of that and then went up to the head of the state police and
[01:56:14.780 --> 01:56:18.860]  they said oh yeah that's a good thing we're gonna do that to you now and the public freaked
[01:56:18.860 --> 01:56:24.500]  out and said you're not gonna do that to us we're gonna resist and they went oh we're
[01:56:24.500 --> 01:56:28.640]  gonna indict them right but they'll be back they'll be back and again it's not that the
[01:56:28.640 --> 01:56:32.540]  average state police are even bad they're being ordered to do this they're seeing what
[01:56:32.540 --> 01:56:37.300]  they'll do because they've now been federalized behind the scenes now briefly i want to finish
[01:56:37.300 --> 01:56:40.660]  your story then i'm going to cover news and i'll go back to all the callers that are patiently
[01:56:40.660 --> 01:56:45.820]  uh holding but jason how did it end i mean the issue here is the cops came because neighbors
[01:56:45.820 --> 01:56:49.620]  were scared you were shooting guns on 20 acres in the country the issue is that the cops
[01:56:49.620 --> 01:56:54.420]  said to you we can't wait till something goes wrong with your guns we're going to take them
[01:56:54.420 --> 01:56:57.340]  i mean imagine if you said well we can't wait till you do something wrong someday we're
[01:56:57.340 --> 01:57:01.140]  going to take yours he would have arrested you for a terroristic threat so you were there
[01:57:01.140 --> 01:57:06.180]  being terrorized by these people what else did they say to you tell me now well he said
[01:57:06.180 --> 01:57:10.660]  that they they wanted to keep them for themselves i mean they can't wait till something happens
[01:57:10.660 --> 01:57:14.140]  because we're going to get them we're going to keep them for ourselves i was like yeah
[01:57:14.140 --> 01:57:22.380]  okay whatever what town do you live in martinsburg is uh boss hog uh the the mayor yeah right
[01:57:22.380 --> 01:57:28.220]  i don't know what goes on around here man i try to keep it myself well i i wouldn't
[01:57:28.220 --> 01:57:33.940]  do that i i would go in i would go file i would go file a criminal complaint of a terroristic
[01:57:33.940 --> 01:57:37.660]  threat and i'd do it with witnesses and i would go hand flyers out all over town and
[01:57:37.660 --> 01:57:42.500]  i'd call the local media and say i mean hey give us your story give us their names give
[01:57:42.500 --> 01:57:46.700]  it to us take photos what happened give it to us we'll write a story about it buddy give
[01:57:46.700 --> 01:57:50.580]  us the proof that police said we can't wait to take your guns because i know that's the
[01:57:50.580 --> 01:57:55.740]  kind of stuff that bad ones do and and that's how you respond to them they came after you
[01:57:55.740 --> 01:58:01.860]  because nobody knows who you are yeah i will assure you if your granddaddy was the i mean
[01:58:01.860 --> 01:58:04.900]  they'd even know if your granddaddy had been county judge and they'd been like we're not

[02:02:13.140 --> 02:02:19.860]  to your show all the time it i agree totally with what you're doing um and i just think every now
[02:02:19.860 --> 02:02:26.100]  and then people need to be uplifted and i think uh there's certain films i've seen some of them from
[02:02:26.100 --> 02:02:33.220]  from your site uh the one about the uh the pre-tribulate tribulation rapture exposed i
[02:02:33.220 --> 02:02:39.780]  think does a good job of lifting us christians up that god is on our side and um i don't know
[02:02:39.780 --> 02:02:44.100]  if you guys are familiar with this or not but another video i recently seen that i think needs
[02:02:44.100 --> 02:02:50.820]  to get out there um the film is called back to eden film dot com or you can watch it for free
[02:02:51.620 --> 02:02:59.940]  and i i just believe that god offered us a victory in uh in being able to produce our own food
[02:02:59.940 --> 02:03:04.820]  uh one of the the hardships with getting into gardening or anything is it's a lot of work and
[02:03:04.820 --> 02:03:10.580]  everybody knows that but it's fun it's fun oh i i totally agree with you being out in nature
[02:03:10.580 --> 02:03:18.580]  experiencing god through nature you can't get any better than that um and i think uh this film
[02:03:18.580 --> 02:03:25.620]  is a way to rejuvenate the people's spirit and getting back to that well i want to see it maybe
[02:03:25.620 --> 02:03:30.500]  if they sell a dvd we'll sell it if we fund ourselves by getting right maybe we'll contact
[02:03:30.500 --> 02:03:34.260]  them and carry it i need to see it but whatever i see that i think is important we sell at info

[02:11:26.180 --> 02:11:31.140]  can just read it yeah it says dallas dallas police relaunch knock and talk initiative
[02:11:32.660 --> 02:11:38.660]  and uh what is the date on that that's 2010 so that's that's two and a half years ago
[02:11:39.220 --> 02:11:45.140]  yeah the first time i saw that was about a decade ago the dallas police department has selected six
[02:11:45.140 --> 02:11:50.500]  officers from all of its seven divisions to do what the department calls knock and talks
[02:11:51.380 --> 02:11:55.220]  and the police officers get permission to search people's homes without a warrant
[02:11:55.220 --> 02:12:00.500]  but knock and talks have historically been a problem for the department and it says in 2005
[02:12:01.060 --> 02:12:06.260]  officers arrested three men in one of the largest drug bust in the city's history police sees two
[02:12:06.260 --> 02:12:10.260]  million in drugs and it goes on the dallas police are famous for planning drugs on you they've been
[02:12:10.260 --> 02:12:13.780]  caught doing that over and over again they just pull over a nice car throw a bag of chalk in the
[02:12:13.780 --> 02:12:18.180]  back and then take it then take your house and then this crime lab certifies it but again they
[02:12:18.180 --> 02:12:23.140]  want nice houses because that's got money and houses sometimes the cops even move into the houses
[02:12:23.140 --> 02:12:31.940]  i lived in rockwall and a couple fbi agents who were corrupt had moved in in the neighborhood to
[02:12:31.940 --> 02:12:38.100]  houses that they had seized in drug raids and then i even had some of them come around they
[02:12:38.100 --> 02:12:42.260]  started messing with my parents this is why we i haven't told the whole story while we moved out
[02:12:42.260 --> 02:12:47.300]  of dallas my dad sold the dental office he had and things and they he'd come by he'd see me at
[02:12:47.300 --> 02:12:52.420]  the local community pool or things like alex you think you're real smart young kid like you
[02:12:52.420 --> 02:12:57.060]  you good-looking guy you got a future and all the rest of it he'd sit there and lean with his trophy
[02:12:57.060 --> 02:13:01.540]  wife beside him at the pool and he'd go you just better watch what happens to you what you've been
[02:13:01.540 --> 02:13:06.180]  talking about and i went oh you know about the local police and then i've been saying they're
[02:13:06.180 --> 02:13:12.020]  drug dealers because i've seen them do it he goes you just watch your butt boy and then our lawyer
[02:13:12.020 --> 02:13:17.700]  called us and said he got the call from the city they're gonna kill me that's america that's what
[02:13:17.700 --> 02:13:26.180]  america is okay and all of us are these naive sheeple don't use their illegal drugs oh they

[02:14:44.180 --> 02:14:52.820]  the articles here's another one at info wars.com by the great kurt nemo biden senate gun bill vote
[02:14:52.820 --> 02:14:57.460]  only the beginning and there's his statements and press releases and video interviews
[02:14:59.620 --> 02:15:04.820]  where he says and they got other congress people quoted there that they're going to get the guns
[02:15:04.820 --> 02:15:07.940]  by increment there will be more events they will get the guns i mean that's it there will be more
[02:15:07.940 --> 02:15:10.740]  there will be more events every time it happens we're going to be blamed for it
[02:15:10.740 --> 02:15:15.860]  when their prozac heads do it or they stage it like colorado's no doubt 100 they staged it boom

[02:15:30.580 --> 02:15:35.540]  i want to say to all the feds all of you on power trips take extra shots you believe in the system
[02:15:35.540 --> 02:15:40.420]  give them to your kids i i don't want your kid to die but maybe that'll maybe if you murder your kid
[02:15:40.420 --> 02:15:45.140]  with a vaccine maybe that'll wake you up and we can not murder much larger numbers of kids you
[02:15:45.140 --> 02:15:50.820]  know well i know though i've had a lot of you on air i had that state attorney on from maryland
[02:15:50.820 --> 02:15:54.500]  uh there in baltimore it was like five six years ago we've got to find that interview
[02:15:54.500 --> 02:15:59.860]  i forget his name was a handsome black guy and i said you know the law says that you you don't
[02:15:59.860 --> 02:16:04.340]  have to take vaccines in maryland i read it to him and i said but you've got a 1500 people
[02:16:04.340 --> 02:16:09.220]  1500 people plus their parents crying with police dogs and riot police saying it's the law to take
[02:16:09.220 --> 02:16:15.460]  shots or they'll all be arrested predominantly black area and i said you know there's no law
[02:16:15.460 --> 02:16:19.140]  but you kick them out for truancy and then arrest them for that but you can't kick them out for
[02:16:19.140 --> 02:16:24.740]  truancy on something that's a policy and not the law and by law you've got to give them that that
[02:16:24.740 --> 02:16:30.020]  state waiver to something that isn't even a law to the policy and he goes well we do have a judge in
[02:16:30.020 --> 02:16:34.500]  one room with those but but you didn't tell anybody did you he goes no he goes man you want
[02:16:34.500 --> 02:16:40.020]  to be a lawyer because you're actually laughing he goes you know all about this and i went do you do

[02:19:25.700 --> 02:19:30.180]  of failure to get the kids immunized but because of truancy laws which were only triggered after
[02:19:30.180 --> 02:19:34.660]  the school expelled the children for not getting the shots there is no law in the united states
[02:19:34.660 --> 02:19:39.700]  which makes vaccinations mandatory so paul breaks that down keep going let me find the guy keep

[02:24:45.300 --> 02:24:49.540]  there's a police state where they only people have 300 euros a day out of their bank accounts
[02:24:49.540 --> 02:24:53.700]  they've already taken up to 40 percent or more out of some people's accounts and now they're
[02:24:53.700 --> 02:24:56.900]  going to just keep taking it out now they're saying europe why they may start taking the
[02:24:56.900 --> 02:25:02.180]  money and then of course here just directly to foreign private banks after all the taxes you
[02:25:02.180 --> 02:25:06.820]  pay they take your money or everything will collapse as they're collapsing everything
[02:25:06.820 --> 02:25:11.940]  and they it's like we're all compulsive gamblers we stay in the government system
[02:25:11.940 --> 02:25:17.460]  we stay in it because we'll lose everything if we don't keep doubling down but it's like gambling
[02:25:17.460 --> 02:25:21.860]  because the gambler keeps betting and betting and betting and getting into debt they can never pay
[02:25:21.860 --> 02:25:25.140]  back because they're gonna they're gonna get it back why they don't want to lose that money so
[02:25:25.140 --> 02:25:31.860]  they got to keep doubling down it's stockholm syndrome ladies and gentlemen don't go in the
[02:25:31.860 --> 02:25:36.100]  casino to begin with well we're in the government casino now they think they've got us to pay for
[02:25:36.100 --> 02:25:42.820]  think they've got us dependent no you don't scott and houston go ahead and tell me about
[02:25:42.820 --> 02:25:48.900]  the police state sir alex i got kind of some optimistic news a lot of your listeners are
[02:25:48.900 --> 02:25:52.580]  going to probably think i'm you know full of it or whatever but i want to hear your good news tell
[02:25:52.580 --> 02:25:59.300]  me okay well i'm a houston firefighter in houston i can't speak for the other departments or police
[02:25:59.300 --> 02:26:06.740]  states and the rest of the country but in houston we are very much on the side of the citizen and if
[02:26:06.740 --> 02:26:13.620]  anything huge happens like a gun complication we are on the side of the citizens of houston
[02:26:13.620 --> 02:26:19.620]  our oath our allegiance when we get our badge is to the citizens of houston it is not to the
[02:26:19.620 --> 02:26:24.340]  president well i want to be clear i want people to start over and let me interrupt you i get into
[02:26:24.340 --> 02:26:30.260]  frothing anger when i see dallas police going in people's houses without warrants trying to
[02:26:30.260 --> 02:26:34.900]  confiscate your guns everyone i know who shoots guns in the middle of nowhere has the cops show
[02:26:34.900 --> 02:26:40.900]  up now including our ranch in east texas it's unbelievable that we've since before it was a
[02:26:40.900 --> 02:26:46.180]  county we got it from from the mexican government okay i mean this is the type of stuff we got to
[02:26:46.180 --> 02:26:51.700]  put up with now in this country and so i get in a primitive level start hopping up and down when i
[02:26:51.700 --> 02:26:57.940]  hear and see all this i get that two things are happening the police state and the global takeover
[02:26:57.940 --> 02:27:03.540]  is waking up cops and military to where they're totally awake now and freaked out and speaking out
[02:27:03.540 --> 02:27:10.660]  or other departments are pure criminal now okay and so the issue here is that there's a battle
[02:27:10.660 --> 02:27:16.900]  for the soul of the police and military going on so i want to recognize that okay and i found
[02:27:16.900 --> 02:27:22.580]  cops are more awake on average than anybody except the military because they actually know that
[02:27:22.580 --> 02:27:27.380]  stuff's going in the wrong direction the problem is cops that like it are obviously criminals are
[02:27:27.380 --> 02:27:32.420]  nut cases or control freaks and i'm telling you they're starting to take over so go ahead
[02:27:33.860 --> 02:27:39.620]  well those cops are either bored or just tainty and of course you know you're training you can't
[02:27:39.620 --> 02:27:44.180]  train a good character you can train somebody to be a police officer a firefighter but their
[02:27:44.180 --> 02:27:48.900]  character if it's if it's bad it's bad but but what do you do when you're given an unlawful
[02:27:48.900 --> 02:27:53.860]  order i mean i get now the orders are so unlawful from the feds that people are saying i'm not going
[02:27:53.860 --> 02:27:57.700]  to do this that's a good discussion that's what can save this country is that discussion
[02:27:58.340 --> 02:28:03.380]  and you don't do it you don't perform it in the fire department there's been a number of times
[02:28:03.380 --> 02:28:08.740]  where we've gone against protocol to save a life we've trained you know how to get in trouble
[02:28:08.740 --> 02:28:12.180]  state saying oh yeah they're now saying you're not allowed to go in the water to save somebody
[02:28:12.180 --> 02:28:16.180]  or you can't go in a burning building if you make the decision to risk your life when that's what
[02:28:16.180 --> 02:28:21.620]  everything's about is your individual will they're telling lifeguards they can't save people if
[02:28:21.620 --> 02:28:28.820]  they're one foot past the you know the county's line when there's laws in common law that you
[02:28:28.820 --> 02:28:34.580]  have to render aid there's a greater law than these garbage laws i follow the common law that's
[02:28:34.580 --> 02:28:41.380]  god's law that's what you're saying yes and i'm letting you know that there are people in houston
[02:28:41.380 --> 02:28:48.820]  with badges that have sold and no damn well what the what the uh government's doing on a federal
[02:28:48.820 --> 02:28:53.300]  level they know what they want to do and they're not going to stand for it we're not going to stand
[02:28:53.300 --> 02:28:57.860]  for it and they can they can send money to us to paint the police cars black and white
[02:29:00.180 --> 02:29:04.340]  your cell phone's breaking up say it again they're like they can send money to
[02:29:04.980 --> 02:29:09.620]  have all the police cars painted black and white to have all the fire apparatus painted red so
[02:29:09.620 --> 02:29:14.340]  that they can have their unified federal look you know that's their little foot in the door
[02:29:14.340 --> 02:29:19.700]  they can come to houston they can have their their training exercises without even the common
[02:29:19.700 --> 02:29:25.860]  decency of letting us emergency services know what's going on no no they're standardizing the
[02:29:25.860 --> 02:29:31.140]  codes so they can command you and stay there you want to come back and finish up yes i'm gonna come
[02:29:31.140 --> 02:29:37.060]  back to scott good caller i love hearing that resolve in the voice they're trying to federalize

[02:29:41.860 --> 02:29:47.460]  a spy if you're in a house and as a firefighter you see criminal stuff that's you don't need to

[02:33:52.900 --> 02:33:57.620]  running things i don't want them in charge and they're setting homeland security up for a civil
[02:33:57.620 --> 02:34:02.340]  war scenario and that's not being openly discussed in the news against gun owners i mean it's
[02:34:02.340 --> 02:34:08.020]  official you heard it here first not bragging i'm telling you this stuff sounds crazy history's
[02:34:08.020 --> 02:34:13.220]  crazy and you heard it here first you heard me over and over again tell you they're gonna flip
[02:34:13.220 --> 02:34:17.700]  homeland security onto gun owners libertarians veterans conservatives and people like how did
[02:34:17.700 --> 02:34:22.500]  you know that before it even got declassified because i've been to the urban warfare drills
[02:34:22.500 --> 02:34:26.180]  see the thing about intelligence why do they send spies out in war i'm gonna go to the firefighter
[02:34:26.180 --> 02:34:30.100]  here in just a second scott and houston in just a moment and then to others in more news
[02:34:30.100 --> 02:34:35.940]  i studied military history i fell into it when i was like eight years old with because anything
[02:34:35.940 --> 02:34:43.540]  i asked for i wouldn't get unless it was a chemistry set or unless it was a bb gun you
[02:34:43.540 --> 02:34:47.700]  know things that my dad thought i needed i would get any other toys stuff i asked for i didn't
[02:34:47.700 --> 02:34:52.500]  usually get it and i could sit there and watch pbs type shows i could sit there and watch
[02:34:53.940 --> 02:34:58.500]  news shows and they would have the ads on before there was a discovery channel or history channel
[02:34:58.500 --> 02:35:05.620]  or history channel for uh you know you know the the world war ii encyclopedia the world war one
[02:35:05.620 --> 02:35:10.580]  encyclopedia the old west encyclopedia and those things i would read them cover to cover by the
[02:35:10.580 --> 02:35:17.140]  time i was about 10 and could read pretty good and you know at like eight or nine i was asking
[02:35:17.140 --> 02:35:19.620]  for him and getting him and looking at the pictures but that's how i got to where i could
[02:35:19.620 --> 02:35:23.300]  read half decent so i wasn't really a quick learner when i was younger until i started
[02:35:23.300 --> 02:35:27.060]  reading those then i got into reading and then you know obviously it just opened up the whole
[02:35:27.060 --> 02:35:31.220]  universe and there's so much even in mainline history books even though you think history's
[02:35:31.220 --> 02:35:35.940]  distorted that's kind of for the general public on the news when you were reading big thick history
[02:35:35.940 --> 02:35:40.340]  books and stuff it's just raw data and then by the time i was about 12 i started reading like
[02:35:40.340 --> 02:35:46.740]  800 page thousand page you know order of the death's head by heinz hobel rise and fall the
[02:35:46.740 --> 02:35:54.340]  third reich shearer uh hit the mind of adolf hitler secret wartime report uh that they'd
[02:35:54.340 --> 02:36:00.740]  published to the mind of stalin the wartime report uh the mind of and so i just by the time i was
[02:36:00.740 --> 02:36:08.100]  like 16 i'd be in bookstores you know just like buying mine comp and and and just wanting to read
[02:36:08.100 --> 02:36:12.180]  the actual stuff these people wrote i remember like being at the checkout counter like that
[02:36:12.180 --> 02:36:15.540]  hitler on the cover they're like i'm like well you're selling the book do you think i'm like
[02:36:15.540 --> 02:36:19.380]  hitler because i'm reading this it just shows people's ignorance i guess i did have blonde
[02:36:19.380 --> 02:36:24.420]  hair and blue eyes then especially but the point is is that it's almost weird to want to you know
[02:36:24.420 --> 02:36:30.420]  know history it's like an idiocracy where they're going we got one that can read and because i'd
[02:36:30.420 --> 02:36:36.740]  studied all that i know military operations i mean they call generals brainiacs who are actually
[02:36:36.740 --> 02:36:40.580]  into reading military history and you know call them the professor and stuff there's not even
[02:36:40.580 --> 02:36:46.740]  many of those that actually are into it they want to play golf date secretaries act tough act like
[02:36:46.740 --> 02:36:51.220]  generals real generals are pouring over things to know the enemy real generals are locked up
[02:36:51.220 --> 02:36:56.820]  reading manuscripts on warfare real but but my the reason i went off into that whole area
[02:36:56.820 --> 02:37:03.300]  is that i learned that you you you see enemy operations by what their actual troop movements
[02:37:03.300 --> 02:37:06.500]  are and what they're doing you can see why they're announcing something or what the
[02:37:06.500 --> 02:37:11.780]  propaganda cover is but when you get the real material you get the real goal now if they're
[02:37:11.780 --> 02:37:17.060]  facing an enemy they'll put out decoys and stuff if they're facing an enemy that even pays attention
[02:37:17.060 --> 02:37:22.340]  the globalists have operated for 50 years as if we don't exist because the public was mesmerized
[02:37:22.340 --> 02:37:27.220]  by tv and culture so their entire battle plan is pretty much public it's a little watered down not
[02:37:27.220 --> 02:37:32.020]  to scare their own internal people like we're only going to kill 80 percent once we get world
[02:37:32.020 --> 02:37:36.420]  government they're like oh well i'll be safe yes you will then the more internal higher up stuff
[02:37:36.420 --> 02:37:42.500]  that we found and republished you know they're going to kill everybody and uh i mean that's
[02:37:42.500 --> 02:37:47.940]  basically for all his purposes everybody you know czar does czar does level you see all that moon
[02:37:47.940 --> 02:37:53.780]  raker written by an mi6 oss guy before that ian phlegm the reason you see all that in hollywood
[02:37:53.780 --> 02:37:58.340]  and culture is because that's the real plan and they're just telling you and getting you ready
[02:37:58.340 --> 02:38:02.820]  and the 20 percent or so they're think they're in the technocracy are kind of in on it and
[02:38:02.820 --> 02:38:06.660]  yeah there are too many of us if you confront them with it they'll admit it they haven't been
[02:38:06.660 --> 02:38:12.980]  brought into the real conspiracy but it's an open conspiracy and so that's what i'm telling you is
[02:38:12.980 --> 02:38:20.580]  that all their operations are out in the open for me because it is out in the open they're not
[02:38:20.580 --> 02:38:26.500]  running silent because they think you're deaf down and blind politically they are running wide
[02:38:26.500 --> 02:38:32.100]  open uncloaked okay i mean what i'm telling you is what they've said i'm not a prophet like so
[02:38:32.100 --> 02:38:36.580]  many people oh this guy how does he know all this it's all folks i'm not it's all written by them
[02:38:36.580 --> 02:38:42.100]  they brag about it there are thousands of declassified chemtrailing programs but they're
[02:38:42.100 --> 02:38:45.620]  not under the name chemtrail it's all going on do you have the al gore clip
[02:38:49.060 --> 02:38:53.380]  okay yeah cue it back up for me when we finish up with this call we'll go to it sorry uh scott i
[02:38:53.380 --> 02:38:58.900]  i went off on a rant and i wasn't bragging how i know this stuff i'm telling people it's all there
[02:38:58.900 --> 02:39:04.260]  and it's not boring it's real uh oh al gore is ready we'll go back to scott in a moment here's
[02:39:04.260 --> 02:39:09.460]  al gore admitting the you know well there's those that want to do it and it's a terrible idea the
[02:39:09.460 --> 02:39:14.980]  program is already ongoing but but here they are on geoengineering there there's a rumor i don't
[02:39:14.980 --> 02:39:20.500]  know if this is true or not that some scientists are trying to figure out a way to block the sun
[02:39:20.500 --> 02:39:27.700]  to try to to slow down global warming yeah it's a measure of the the feeling of desperation that
[02:39:27.700 --> 02:39:32.500]  some of them are they really thinking they could do that well some of them are seriously proposing
[02:39:32.500 --> 02:39:38.740]  and i i think it's completely nuts yeah uh you know you put a another kind of pollution sulfur
[02:39:38.740 --> 02:39:46.420]  dioxide up to orbit the cover the atmosphere the sky won't be really blue and the way it is now
[02:39:46.420 --> 02:39:50.820]  anymore it's not blue anymore but it would block out some of the sun's heat uh so that we wouldn't
[02:39:50.820 --> 02:39:56.420]  have to take the difficult steps to stop spewing all this global warming pollution into the
[02:39:56.420 --> 02:40:00.020]  atmosphere because your investments are in china there are a lot of problems we want to shut us
[02:40:00.020 --> 02:40:06.900]  down proposing it turns out plants need the sun sunlight yes it wouldn't stop the acidification
[02:40:06.900 --> 02:40:13.300]  of the oceans and uh it really should be yet another wake-up call for why we need to there
[02:40:13.300 --> 02:40:18.980]  you go putting all this pollution up there the whole clips at info wars.com now the issue here
[02:40:18.980 --> 02:40:24.420]  is this is ongoing since the early 90s in an official global program and they add it to the
[02:40:24.420 --> 02:40:28.580]  jet fuel the companies don't even know it's part of national security people say look at the spray
[02:40:28.580 --> 02:40:35.220]  planes it is the planes it's added and then projected out of the jet engines okay that's
[02:40:35.220 --> 02:40:39.860]  why before 20 years ago or so chemtrails never stayed up there more than a few minutes they stay
[02:40:39.860 --> 02:40:47.300]  up hours now because they're not ice crystals they are nuclei of sulfur dioxide and barium salts and
[02:40:47.300 --> 02:40:52.260]  other things forming water droplets that are larger to be reflective and there's a bunch of
[02:40:52.260 --> 02:41:00.340]  other programs as well but notice ellen degeneris has to say i heard this isn't a rumor see because
[02:41:00.340 --> 02:41:04.180]  no one actually goes and does research he's like i heard there's two billion bullets no there's not
[02:41:04.180 --> 02:41:09.540]  my dearie even though it's all admitted if you just did the research but people don't know how
[02:41:11.060 --> 02:41:17.620]  or they never imagined because again we were just here 20 years ago the old timers when i first got
[02:41:17.620 --> 02:41:21.780]  on here people were like planes are spraying and i'm like shut up kook and then i found that it was
[02:41:21.780 --> 02:41:26.100]  true but all we knew the name was was chemtrail then somebody called in about 10 years ago and
[02:41:26.100 --> 02:41:32.900]  goes have you search engine high altitude aerosol programming or weather modification or and i'm
[02:41:32.900 --> 02:41:37.940]  like and i typed it it was like 50 000 results department of energy the spray planes how they do
[02:41:37.940 --> 02:41:43.460]  it the grid patterns top scientists admitting it just just i mean just like thousands of volumes
[02:41:43.460 --> 02:41:48.660]  you could never even i mean just all out in the open a hundred percent do you know how frustrating
[02:41:48.660 --> 02:41:56.820]  that is you know how frustrating and then the public callers are chemtrails real you know the
[02:41:56.820 --> 02:42:01.060]  word chemtrail isn't real because the public doesn't know it's real that the aerosol terra
[02:42:01.060 --> 02:42:09.220]  farming geoengineering high altitude aerosol program passive auroral programs harp programs
[02:42:09.220 --> 02:42:14.660]  i have the harp director on and there was an air force colonel on this is interviews online
[02:42:14.660 --> 02:42:18.980]  harp calls and goes the director likes your show and wants to explain to you it's not a problem
[02:42:18.980 --> 02:42:23.380]  we never do this but he wants to come on so we call we check it's the real director of harp
[02:42:24.180 --> 02:42:28.580]  the civilian director there's an air force colonel calls me for the show and he goes you know i'm
[02:42:28.580 --> 02:42:35.300]  going to the firefighter here in a moment and he says all right we don't really do this and i'm
[02:42:35.300 --> 02:42:39.140]  going to be on the line the whole time if you bring up anything that's national security if
[02:42:39.140 --> 02:42:43.060]  you're not recording this are you well we're checking we're not you better not and i said
[02:42:43.060 --> 02:42:46.900]  and i said the colonel's name on air and stuff after that and i said look man hey you guys
[02:42:46.900 --> 02:42:52.340]  contacted us so i get him i was supposed to go an hour i think it went like 30 minutes and
[02:42:53.380 --> 02:42:57.380]  one time it cuts off the colonel cuts him off calls back and says i don't go into that area
[02:42:57.380 --> 02:43:01.060]  this is on air this happened then during a break he goes stop going into that area it's over well
[02:43:01.060 --> 02:43:06.180]  finally the interview ends 30 minutes early because the mad scientist is like i like setting
[02:43:06.180 --> 02:43:12.500]  the atmosphere on fire we can project it in some nights light it on you know cause explosions and
[02:43:12.500 --> 02:43:22.900]  the colonel just cut it off right there and people ask me is there a heart program it's on record it
[02:43:22.900 --> 02:43:27.940]  admits the eastman patents all of it let me just go to the calls scott i'm sorry you've got the
[02:43:27.940 --> 02:43:32.260]  floor make your point about people waking up and where this is going and what the police officers
[02:43:32.260 --> 02:43:39.060]  you know are saying what percentage would you say really understand we're in deep trouble oh i'd say
[02:43:39.060 --> 02:43:46.980]  in houston i'd say 80 to 90 percent you're you're just explain let me explain something on the
[02:43:46.980 --> 02:43:50.340]  surface and then i'll explain something on the you're explaining how the feds are down there
[02:43:50.340 --> 02:43:57.220]  federalizing that's only waking people up oh that's only pissing us off because they're not
[02:43:57.220 --> 02:44:01.780]  telling anybody about it they're not telling the emergency services about it do you know how
[02:44:01.780 --> 02:44:07.540]  freaked out we were in the fire station when we hear over the air that we're having mass shootings
[02:44:07.540 --> 02:44:12.020]  at a school with helicopters flying over and you got a heavy fire apparatus
[02:44:12.020 --> 02:44:17.300]  hauling butt over there to see what's going on just so that they can say oh this is just an
[02:44:17.300 --> 02:44:24.900]  operation and that the next day they have the audacity to insult us and say oh we sent a memo
[02:44:24.900 --> 02:44:30.500]  i guess it didn't go through you sent a memo no no no when you fly helicopters over hey wait a
[02:44:30.500 --> 02:44:35.460]  minute when they crashed in houston 15 years ago and some delta force people reportedly almost died
[02:44:35.460 --> 02:44:41.940]  they said it didn't exist on the news and the police imagined it yeah well now the news is
[02:44:41.940 --> 02:44:46.660]  spot i guess things are changing like billy said you know last week when you had them on things
[02:44:46.660 --> 02:44:52.180]  are changing a little more and the media's local media is starting to kind of put things out there
[02:44:52.740 --> 02:44:57.220]  and well they better people better get religion real fast because i'm telling you they're going
[02:44:57.220 --> 02:45:02.340]  to launch a giant false flag and a bunch of mass shootings and blaming on us and they're going to
[02:45:02.340 --> 02:45:07.540]  start a civil war and so people better really get ready for that propaganda and because people are
[02:45:07.540 --> 02:45:12.020]  going to know the globalists did it but a lot of people are going to be too scared to say it
[02:45:12.020 --> 02:45:17.380]  and if we don't say it when that time happens and by the way they kill me right after something like
[02:45:17.380 --> 02:45:23.060]  that happens folks you know it's on they're not going to kill you they can't they can't kill you
[02:45:23.060 --> 02:45:28.340]  uh don't say that martyr well no they can't do they can't do anything to you because it would
[02:45:28.340 --> 02:45:34.260]  cause such a humongous uprising that they don't want and people need to realize and the feds need
[02:45:34.260 --> 02:45:39.860]  to realize the police are not on their side the police are on the side of the citizens and i know
[02:45:39.860 --> 02:45:45.300]  a lot of people don't like cops they write tickets the young cops get carried away with their job
[02:45:45.300 --> 02:45:50.100]  they kind of go a little bit against you know against people sure they've tried to turn you
[02:45:50.100 --> 02:45:54.260]  against the people but it hadn't completely worked i completely occurred and understand this in the
[02:45:54.260 --> 02:46:00.100]  boss hog areas where there are bad police when the stuff hits the fan they're all just going to go
[02:46:00.100 --> 02:46:05.220]  home the real news is it's going to be the good cops and the good military that are going to stand
[02:46:05.220 --> 02:46:10.100]  up when this goes on because evil people they don't fight for anything they only do what's easy
[02:46:10.100 --> 02:46:15.060]  see remember we've got the fighters we've got the men and women in this country that actually care
[02:46:15.060 --> 02:46:20.740]  and let me tell you one good man is worth a hundred scumbags i'm telling you oh yeah that's
[02:46:20.740 --> 02:46:26.500]  our military our police on the local level is going to be our military our police and our
[02:46:26.500 --> 02:46:33.620]  citizens who own guns and know how to use them are that that's our line of defense but did the
[02:46:33.620 --> 02:46:43.300]  locals know what was going on when they federalized all the codes no no but i mean i'm talking about
[02:46:43.300 --> 02:46:47.060]  firing police codes you know going into that federal call system and getting rid of your local
[02:46:47.060 --> 02:46:54.260]  calls i don't even be honest i don't even know what you're talking about there well that's mainly
[02:46:54.260 --> 02:46:59.220]  with the police they have emergency codes and they they're federalizing those and going to scrambled
[02:46:59.220 --> 02:47:06.900]  systems you can't hear it well that's a part of a whole digital uh operation that they're going to
[02:47:06.900 --> 02:47:12.740]  yes yes that's the real takeover and a lot of and a lot of that is to keep the media out of it
[02:47:12.740 --> 02:47:18.340]  but that has its ups and downs you want the media to be able to know but on the other hand media can
[02:47:18.340 --> 02:47:23.860]  really screw up a situation no i know that but i'm telling you look there's all the road to hell is
[02:47:23.860 --> 02:47:29.860]  paved with good intentions and and and and the issue is obviously yeah but they had ways with
[02:47:29.860 --> 02:47:33.220]  codes and things to keep the media from knowing what was going on before let me tell you having
[02:47:33.220 --> 02:47:41.460]  the globalist control the communications codes is half the takeover yeah there's a lot other ways of
[02:47:41.460 --> 02:47:46.340]  codes and they can use them in digital i mean back back in the day during the civil rights movement
[02:47:46.340 --> 02:47:51.700]  uh when there was a riot going on they called it a brush fire over the radio and that was the
[02:47:51.700 --> 02:47:56.100]  firefighters knew we had a riot and the media didn't know that there was a riot so i agree
[02:47:56.100 --> 02:48:00.740]  with you there's other ways i know i'm just saying that there if you think there's a science to
[02:48:00.740 --> 02:48:06.100]  controlling the public there's a greater science to controlling you the people in government service
[02:48:06.100 --> 02:48:11.140]  are in the biggest brainwashing chambers there are because they may let obama build up the domestic
[02:48:11.140 --> 02:48:16.100]  police state that he leaves office a right-winger comes in people want to think they're a good guy
[02:48:16.100 --> 02:48:20.420]  then they blow something up and start the civil war let me tell you that they know what they're
[02:48:20.420 --> 02:48:25.140]  doing i'm just saying folks this is serious god bless you good to hear from you we cover this
[02:48:25.140 --> 02:48:34.820]  monsanto situation here's from salon how the monsanto protection act snuck into law give folks
[02:48:34.820 --> 02:48:40.180]  a document cam shot of that for tv viewers and provision that protects the biotech giant from
[02:48:40.180 --> 02:48:45.620]  litigation past congress without many members knowing about it just like the vaccine manufacturers
[02:48:45.620 --> 02:48:49.060]  are given liability protection and they lie to the public say it's the law to take shots
[02:48:49.060 --> 02:48:52.580]  then they lie to you and say there are no side effects when the insert says it can kill you
[02:48:52.580 --> 02:48:56.820]  give you cancer diabetes everything else this is showing how criminal they are
[02:48:57.540 --> 02:49:03.220]  okay and and so obama has signed this and of course he was saying he wouldn't sign it just
[02:49:03.220 --> 02:49:11.220]  like the ndaa so opposition would form all that won't get signed monsanto wrote this and now what
[02:49:11.220 --> 02:49:15.300]  are they talking about the food is going to be the vaccine it's going to have the virus in it
[02:49:15.300 --> 02:49:21.780]  that's what bill gates is pushing and so because this is medical food this is weaponized food
[02:49:21.780 --> 02:49:26.820]  they're now going to come out with not eight major food crops all being gmo that you know grow
[02:49:26.820 --> 02:49:30.260]  pesticides and i'm strong enough to kill bugs that eat them but they say it's safe for you
[02:49:30.260 --> 02:49:36.900]  that's what bt corn is just so crazy man organ failures just spiking in all the rodents they
[02:49:36.900 --> 02:49:42.100]  give this stuff to and test it kills them i mean again i'm on air explaining to you what's going
[02:49:42.100 --> 02:49:46.980]  on i mean you need to know why you're going to die okay i mean you need to know but it'll take
[02:49:46.980 --> 02:49:52.980]  20 years you know but now with kids that are fast growing cells it's going to hurt them even worse
[02:49:52.980 --> 02:49:56.420]  that's why the portal kids man you go in restaurants you walk down the street i mean
[02:49:56.420 --> 02:50:03.060]  kids look like they've been run over by 18 wheelers and so they just think you'll never
[02:50:03.060 --> 02:50:09.220]  be able to realize why everybody's dying and getting sick you know with with the the different
[02:50:09.220 --> 02:50:14.340]  bt corns that monsanto others have put out they have to plant sanctuary crops of corn under
[02:50:14.340 --> 02:50:23.300]  federal law just because it'll kill all the honey bees if they go eat off this stuff they go collect
[02:50:23.300 --> 02:50:27.060]  the pollen and bring it back and turn it into honey they partially digest it and vomit it
[02:50:27.060 --> 02:50:38.740]  back up that's what honey is portal buggers die can i have a sanctuary corn belt can i have what
[02:50:38.740 --> 02:50:46.260]  the honey bees are eating oh i'm sorry i don't get that do i and every food crop's not going to
[02:50:46.260 --> 02:50:50.820]  be gmo and now their genetics are spreading into all the normal varieties and soon you won't have a

[02:54:04.420 --> 02:54:07.300]  alex jones on the gcn radio network
[02:54:10.420 --> 02:54:15.380]  ladies and gentlemen we are back live by the way david knight's got in-depth reports tonight he's
[02:54:15.380 --> 02:54:18.420]  going to be hosting him for awards nightly news i think we're airing a special report on the
[02:54:18.420 --> 02:54:21.620]  second amendment i've been working on for three or four days with darren mcgreen i believe that's
[02:54:21.620 --> 02:54:25.460]  tonight on the nightly news if not it'll be tomorrow on the radio slash tv show that the
[02:54:25.460 --> 02:54:29.700]  info wars live the alex jones show that's just known in syndication the show you're listening
[02:54:29.700 --> 02:54:36.980]  to right now the radio show slash tv but they passed this like the fellow reserve act was passed
[02:54:36.980 --> 02:54:44.500]  without following the constitution or the senate and house rules they rammed it through with
[02:54:44.500 --> 02:54:50.900]  bipartisan evil and and again back in the 60s and then 70s they got these vaccine liability
[02:54:50.900 --> 02:54:55.860]  protection passed so they could kill everybody because you know sometimes the kid dies right
[02:54:55.860 --> 02:55:00.180]  there and you and and and and you know the cops aren't evil and they find out it's the vaccine
[02:55:00.180 --> 02:55:04.420]  and don't throw the parents in jail and then you you've got to have immunity so they've got a
[02:55:04.420 --> 02:55:10.980]  license to kill and these are called pharmacological crops they've got the eight major food crops are
[02:55:10.980 --> 02:55:18.980]  like 89 gmo now some are 86 some are 92 on average about 89 gmo it'll soon be pretty much
[02:55:18.980 --> 02:55:23.940]  all gmo that's why whole foods is saying we're going to be gmo now but we'll label it and you
[02:55:23.940 --> 02:55:27.700]  just won't have a choice 90 something percent will be that there'll be a small area it'll cost
[02:55:27.700 --> 02:55:31.940]  10 times more and then they're going to harass and hunt down and shut down all the organic people
[02:55:31.940 --> 02:55:37.460]  that that's that's the next phase they've already been beta testing it uh and again the royal family
[02:55:37.460 --> 02:55:43.940]  in england the um the the government elites in um in fact i've already done a report on this but
[02:55:43.940 --> 02:55:48.660]  we should get it from last year and then re-air it tonight but if you can't find it i'll just
[02:55:48.660 --> 02:55:54.660]  redo it with and in fact just have the the news crew pull up like chinese elite eat or different
[02:55:54.660 --> 02:56:00.900]  food uh germanly eat different food british elite different food uh german government gets clean
[02:56:00.900 --> 02:56:06.660]  vaccine and then it says in the articles la times financial times of london der Spiegel that oh
[02:56:06.660 --> 02:56:14.020]  yeah they have in fact one headline was communist chinese have secret organic uh greenhouse farms
[02:56:14.020 --> 02:56:18.900]  all over the country and it's the same deal they they truck it around when the elites fly around
[02:56:18.900 --> 02:56:23.140]  they have their own chefs on board they don't go to restaurants or they go to special places
[02:56:23.140 --> 02:56:27.940]  where it's totally certified that's why john carrey famously has been in wendy's with teresa
[02:56:27.940 --> 02:56:32.660]  hines carrey and won't even eat a french fry you know he famously said take a bite and probably he
[02:56:32.660 --> 02:56:36.260]  was like oh i'm not hungry and then this happened at other ones where you know obama goes and eats
[02:56:36.260 --> 02:56:40.660]  the stuff he doesn't care he knows oh it's like jack daniels i'm just going to eat this hamburger
[02:56:40.660 --> 02:56:43.700]  but it's not really like jack daniels you're designed to be able to handle some of that and
[02:56:43.700 --> 02:56:49.140]  yeah it'll rot your liver and kills 500,000 people a year they estimate alcoholism in this country
[02:56:49.140 --> 02:56:53.860]  uh over 500,000 related the point is this is all of this is a cocktail of death
[02:56:55.060 --> 02:56:58.900]  yeah there it is political and corporate elites shun gm food on their own plate well it's like
[02:56:58.900 --> 02:57:09.940]  monsanto 1999 c uh cnbc reported on it so did uh cbc and all their facilities worldwide the
[02:57:11.140 --> 02:57:16.340]  the engineering class the science the biotech class demand totally organic filtered water
[02:57:16.340 --> 02:57:21.220]  everything at their facilities that guys at the end of this hour typing real quick monsanto has
[02:57:21.220 --> 02:57:30.900]  gmo free cafeterias boy but you're gonna eat it you're gonna eat it you're gonna eat it you're
[02:57:30.900 --> 02:57:37.380]  gonna you know you can't help it you know you want it and i hear poor old limbaugh incredible person

[02:57:42.340 --> 02:57:46.340]  they estimate the i'm not trying to bash rush he gets in there and says all gmo is is like
[02:57:46.340 --> 02:57:51.940]  george washington carver breeding two types of you know uh plant together to make a better yield
[02:57:51.940 --> 02:57:58.980]  it's nothing but hybridization uh no putting uh spider genes and human genes and and a poison
[02:57:58.980 --> 02:58:06.820]  gene uh toxin released by a bacteria or a fungus uh or to put a you know a snake venom into a crop
[02:58:06.820 --> 02:58:11.620]  where bugs can't eat it and then we feed it to humans hey look the bugs won't eat it that's great
[02:58:11.620 --> 02:58:14.820]  it kills them yeah hey let's see oh that sounds good let me get some corn on the cob there
