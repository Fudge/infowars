[01:01.400 --> 01:04.640]  giving Ron Paul a run for his money when it comes to exposing the private run
[01:04.640 --> 01:08.440]  for profit fellow reserve very thankful for what congressman Alan Grayson is
[01:08.440 --> 01:12.680]  doing he's coming up and then Ron Paul Dr. Ron Paul commerce from Ron Paul

[01:40.840 --> 01:45.040]  busy with interviews and when Congress is in session that it's a hovering
[01:45.040 --> 01:49.760]  interview anytime from 1115 to 1130 any time the next 30 minutes he's going to
[01:49.760 --> 01:57.360]  be on with us so I don't want to launch our main story right now because there
[01:57.360 --> 02:02.760]  are so many issues so many angles so many points I want to make and I want to
[02:02.760 --> 02:08.960]  be extremely focused with what I'm going to reveal and cover here today
[02:08.960 --> 02:13.720]  because I literally had a brainstorm last night and a brainstorm this
[02:13.720 --> 02:18.840]  morning and just so much that was hidden in plain view that we've covered but
[02:18.840 --> 02:24.320]  but not really put together completely came into very clear focus for me
[02:24.320 --> 02:30.600]  especially this morning red alert red alert at info wars calm and prison
[02:30.600 --> 02:35.120]  planet calm and maybe every six months or so we issue a red alert or a maximum
[02:35.120 --> 02:39.320]  alert as I sometimes call them we've issued two in the last two days the
[02:39.320 --> 02:43.700]  first one was maximum alert US troops now occupying America all over the
[02:43.700 --> 02:47.960]  country from the east coast to the west coast and every major state videos are
[02:47.960 --> 02:52.160]  pouring out of regular army regular Marines National Guard Air Force
[02:52.160 --> 02:58.800]  National Guard Army Marine Corps Reserve running illegal checkpoints all over
[02:58.800 --> 03:03.960]  the country pulling people out of cars shutting down highways pointing guns at
[03:03.960 --> 03:08.320]  people they are locked and loaded they are armed and there's certain just a
[03:08.320 --> 03:13.680]  massive activity going on under north calm open announcements of 379,000
[03:13.680 --> 03:17.080]  troops to be phased in in the next year on the streets of your town and city the
[03:17.080 --> 03:20.400]  Pentagon told Congress they're going to even be in small towns they're going to
[03:20.400 --> 03:27.280]  be merging in with your local police it's high treason absolute red dawn now
[03:27.280 --> 03:36.880]  that said I openly announced I was sending my crew to the g20 they openly
[03:36.880 --> 03:44.080]  went out because defense link and the Pentagon reported that at a National
[03:44.080 --> 03:50.440]  Guard base they were massing 2,500 Army National Guard Air Force Guard MPs
[03:50.440 --> 03:55.440]  regular Army MPs and Air Force MPs that's in the defense link articles and
[03:55.440 --> 04:01.160]  so we drive up the front gate as I've done many times at other events and said
[04:01.160 --> 04:04.000]  we like to talk to information officer about we're going to be deployed what
[04:04.000 --> 04:07.840]  your mission is and I'm going to tell the story later in the show and I did
[04:07.840 --> 04:14.200]  call and talk to the Pittsburgh County police in the county that Pittsburgh's
[04:14.200 --> 04:23.120]  in and it's just absolutely horrible what happened they call the renter car
[04:23.120 --> 04:26.440]  place off the license plate on the car because they went to the front gate and
[04:26.440 --> 04:34.360]  they basically got the cell phone number and information for Jason Douglas one
[04:34.360 --> 04:39.240]  of our team members and called him up and basically said we know you're a
[04:39.240 --> 04:44.320]  terrorist and you're going to be on the terror list for the rest of your life
[04:44.320 --> 04:48.960]  and was basically laughing about it and it just really hit me this is the

[08:30.440 --> 08:38.240]  twilight zone but in the last 24 hours it's really gotten weird headline
[08:38.240 --> 08:44.240]  ladies and gentlemen up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com we're
[08:44.240 --> 08:50.320]  gonna have a more detailed report later today I wrote this up with Aaron Dykes
[08:50.320 --> 08:56.320]  last night and then integrated it in with the basic account of our three
[08:56.320 --> 09:01.600]  info wars crew members in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania for the G20 summit
[09:04.080 --> 09:10.400]  red alert military attempts to frame info wars reporters for terrorism at G20
[09:10.400 --> 09:17.360]  I will give you all the details on that coming up also if you go to CNN or the
[09:17.360 --> 09:20.760]  dredge report we of course have it all posted up on info wars dot com and
[09:20.760 --> 09:28.320]  prison planet dot com its headlines like the end of the dollar G20 discusses
[09:28.320 --> 09:35.400]  removing dollar as world currency these are the types of headlines that are in
[09:35.400 --> 09:43.080]  the AP AFP Reuters there are more than a hundred in the last two days that I have
[09:43.080 --> 09:47.520]  seen you just Google the term New World Order and click news you'll see hundreds
[09:47.520 --> 09:53.360]  and hundreds of news stories just in the last couple days reporting that world
[09:53.360 --> 09:56.880]  government is being established the president of the Czech Republic who's
[09:56.880 --> 10:00.920]  also president of the EU right now openly said the answers to our global
[10:00.920 --> 10:05.880]  economic crises are not global government he said that in his
[10:05.880 --> 10:11.360]  presidential speech at the UN yesterday Muammar Gaddafi said H1N1 is a
[10:11.360 --> 10:17.080]  government biological weapon just like AIDS is boy he couldn't be telling more
[10:17.080 --> 10:22.200]  of the truth he went on to say basically the government killed Kennedy just I
[10:22.200 --> 10:26.800]  mean I'm living in the twilight zone here I mean you've got the head of the
[10:26.800 --> 10:34.000]  Czech Republic coming out and saying we don't want a world government you've
[10:34.000 --> 10:41.120]  got Gaddafi running around talking about the JFK assassination H1N1 and then
[10:41.120 --> 10:47.800]  on top of all that a little more than a month ago I'm sitting there at Charlie
[10:47.800 --> 10:53.560]  Sheen's house and it's funny I even meant to talk about this on air but I
[10:53.560 --> 10:59.120]  didn't know how to handle it and I didn't know how to this how to broach it
[10:59.120 --> 11:03.800]  with listeners but now since it's been on national TV that he met with Buzz
[11:03.800 --> 11:09.360]  Aldrin had dinner with him because the paparazzi showed up TMZ and ET and a
[11:09.360 --> 11:15.200]  bunch of other shows have played it you know with Charlie last week we can have
[11:15.200 --> 11:20.040]  a go having dinner with Buzz Aldrin in Los Angeles where he lives I met Charlie
[11:20.040 --> 11:25.800]  Sheen's house now this is Twilight Zone and there's more to it but I'm not
[11:25.800 --> 11:29.760]  gonna go much further and we're sitting there talking about were the moon
[11:29.760 --> 11:34.440]  landings real yes we think they're real but they're hiding secret technology so
[11:34.440 --> 11:37.760]  they didn't want to show all of that and that's what I've got from insiders at
[11:37.760 --> 11:42.120]  NASA people like Raymond Teague who I've had on the show who was in mission
[11:42.120 --> 11:46.520]  control frontline and they had three backups or three total two backups he
[11:46.520 --> 11:52.960]  was on the front you know a team first string controlling the RCA cameras he
[11:52.960 --> 11:59.800]  can he control the RCA cameras on Skylab after that and I'm going yes the
[11:59.800 --> 12:04.720]  intel I've got is that they're covering up massive water on the moon and that it
[12:04.720 --> 12:08.960]  basically covers the entire surface under a permafrost a few feet under the
[12:08.960 --> 12:15.000]  ground and Charlie says yes I've read that as well and Charlie and then his
[12:15.000 --> 12:19.920]  phone rings and it's his stuntman who in all those big movies has been a stunt
[12:19.920 --> 12:24.040]  man he's one of his best friends and he says I just had dinner with Buzz
[12:24.040 --> 12:30.840]  Aldrin this is before Charlie ever met Buzz Aldrin with dinner with him you're
[12:30.840 --> 12:33.840]  not gonna believe this it's gonna be coming out in the next month but it's
[12:33.840 --> 12:42.720]  top secret and then I look at the times of London today and there's the headline
[12:42.720 --> 12:47.240]  and I told my wife about this and I said I don't know how to handle it and I
[12:47.240 --> 12:51.560]  think I even mentioned when I got back big news on the moon coming out but I
[12:51.560 --> 12:56.000]  didn't want it I probably should have but I was so focused on Charlie about to
[12:56.000 --> 13:00.000]  go public with 9-11 and that was a secret at the time and a lot of other
[13:00.000 --> 13:05.160]  things we're doing behind the scenes that'll remain secret for some time and
[13:05.160 --> 13:09.280]  then I turn on the drudge report this morning India's lunar mission finds
[13:09.280 --> 13:16.920]  evidence of water on moon covering most of the surface times of London I mean
[13:16.920 --> 13:22.000]  imagine what buzz Aldrin knows he's talking about that monolith on the moon
[13:22.000 --> 13:29.960]  of Mars he comes on my show and we later talked to his publicist she's like
[13:29.960 --> 13:34.520]  oh yeah buzz knows who's you are you know buzz likes what you're doing when I
[13:34.520 --> 13:38.640]  call the Pittsburgh police up call the number back that they called up trying
[13:38.640 --> 13:43.240]  to frame our employees trying to set them up the guy goes I know who you are
[13:43.240 --> 13:48.600]  Alex I know who you were before I googled you so it's just interesting
[13:48.600 --> 13:53.800]  no buzz Aldrin knows who we are and the Pittsburgh police do it's it's just
[13:53.800 --> 13:59.080]  crazy but side issue I'm gonna talk about that later when I get some time or
[13:59.080 --> 14:05.360]  maybe tomorrow it's just so bizarre to know over a month beforehand that the
[14:05.360 --> 14:10.040]  Indian probe that's what buzz Aldrin told Charlie stuntman I'm gonna get
[14:10.040 --> 14:14.400]  Charlie on next week we'll get Charlie to tell the story more fully and I forgot
[14:14.400 --> 14:18.360]  to ask you maybe talked about this at dinner with buzz Aldrin they had like a
[14:18.360 --> 14:25.280]  two-hour dinner but it's just so weird to know Charlie Sheen and buzz Aldrin and
[14:25.280 --> 14:30.400]  a month and a week before it comes out in the news to know that they discovered
[14:30.400 --> 14:37.960]  ice basically covering entire surface of the moon such a huge development
[14:40.440 --> 14:47.720]  it's just crazy and to have the army lie to the police and tell them all these
[14:47.720 --> 14:51.360]  lies about what my employees were doing remember how they arrested that woman in
[14:51.360 --> 14:54.880]  New York because she went to an army base and was asking them if they were a
[14:54.880 --> 14:58.560]  designated FEMA camp and they arrested her and she was a mother of three no
[14:58.560 --> 15:04.240]  criminal record pretty wealthy and they put her in a mental institution saying
[15:04.240 --> 15:07.680]  she was crazy because she believed in FEMA camps and the news reported it like
[15:07.680 --> 15:12.800]  it was good I mean I guess I'm I guess we're blessed they didn't just grab my
[15:12.800 --> 15:18.120]  employees and put them in a mental institution they pulled up at the arm
[15:18.120 --> 15:21.600]  area and said we like to talk to your public information officer about the
[15:21.600 --> 15:26.120]  defense link press release you put out and then they said you're not real media
[15:26.120 --> 15:30.320]  we've never heard of info wars or that you're on the radio in Austin or KLBJ or
[15:30.320 --> 15:35.440]  Channel 10 and and then and they we want to talk to your boss we want to talk to
[15:35.440 --> 15:39.960]  your producer or editor they kept calling it like it was a newspaper we
[15:39.960 --> 15:44.440]  never said we were a newspaper we said we're TV with cameras and so they call
[15:44.440 --> 15:49.680]  me on the cell when they go here you go sir here's Alex Jones our boss and the
[15:49.680 --> 15:53.480]  guy starts laughing going that could be anybody maybe come back tomorrow maybe
[15:53.480 --> 15:56.800]  we'll talk to you so I hear him leave and they go okay I go go interview troops
[15:56.800 --> 15:59.400]  downtown which they've now done and go interview police and ask them about
[15:59.400 --> 16:05.000]  policy commentators which they've now done and then I mean I'm talking to do
[16:05.000 --> 16:09.240]  as he gets on the car and drives off well they get a call at their hotel hi
[16:09.240 --> 16:15.680]  Alamo rental car you know you got bad breaks on that car we need you to bring
[16:15.680 --> 16:19.320]  that back yeah we're gonna give you two free days for the trouble and by then
[16:19.320 --> 16:28.360]  they'd lock down downtown Pittsburgh and so Jason Douglas tells the police
[16:28.360 --> 16:34.880]  officer posing as a Alamo rental car agent he tells them and I talked to the
[16:34.880 --> 16:38.880]  cop the cop admitted that this is what you know Jason did and and what the cop
[16:38.880 --> 16:45.840]  did both their stories match they're both saying the same thing and he says
[16:45.840 --> 16:48.440]  listen I'm locked down they've now blocked the streets I can bring it back
[16:48.440 --> 16:52.200]  to tomorrow I guess we can bring the car back and the guy goes let me be honest
[16:52.200 --> 16:58.280]  with you I'm with an anti-terrorism task force with the FBI in the US Army and
[16:58.280 --> 17:04.480]  you're gonna be on a database for the rest of your life as a kid I mean it's
[17:04.480 --> 17:10.640]  so crazy that they just put reporters on terrorism watch list for just going to
[17:10.640 --> 17:14.120]  Pittsburgh and trying to talk to a public information officer and then they
[17:14.120 --> 17:18.040]  call up with ruses I mean this country so far gone with the terror watch list
[17:18.040 --> 17:21.520]  and the rest of it ladies and gentlemen we've got him a vote is coming up we
[17:21.520 --> 17:25.360]  normally go to a break in a moment I'm gonna skip this break coming up at the
[17:25.360 --> 17:30.400]  20 after congressman Alan Grayson is Democratic congressman in Florida's
[17:30.400 --> 17:35.760]  eighth congressional district he's a graduate of Harvard College and without
[17:35.760 --> 17:41.240]  going through his lengthy bio here he's been a big supporter of HR 1207 and he's
[17:41.240 --> 17:45.120]  one of the leading lights now calling for an audit of the private run-for-profit
[17:45.120 --> 17:49.560]  Federal Reserve and he's really grilled Bernanke and Geithner and others and
[17:49.560 --> 17:54.960]  we're just very very blessed to have him in Congress congressman thank you for
[17:54.960 --> 17:58.240]  joining us thank you thank you and if we're gonna talk about what I've done
[17:58.240 --> 18:01.200]  before the thing I'm most proud of it is that for years I've fought war
[18:01.200 --> 18:06.400]  profiteers in Iraq and I was the litigator the prosecutor in every single
[18:06.400 --> 18:10.240]  case pending in federal court and being litigated against war profiteers before
[18:10.240 --> 18:13.960]  I was elected to Congress so that's the one thing I'd want people to know about
[18:13.960 --> 18:19.240]  where I was and what I did in the first 50 years of my life absolutely in fact
[18:19.240 --> 18:23.240]  congressman and I was fluid with your scheduler who's been very helpful but
[18:23.240 --> 18:27.480]  just so I know so I know what I can get to how long do we have with you it's
[18:27.480 --> 18:33.240]  difficult to predict we might have 10 or 15 minutes okay great well let's talk
[18:33.240 --> 18:36.680]  about that then first congressman because I am not a Republican or a
[18:36.680 --> 18:41.880]  Democrat no bid contracts even for American companies $15 million for a
[18:41.880 --> 18:45.960]  blue tarp Halliburton in the Chicago Tribune running child kidnapping rings
[18:45.960 --> 18:50.920]  you were there exposing all this tell us about it well it's it's everything you
[18:50.920 --> 18:55.560]  could imagine that's bad and worse you have documented situations where the
[18:55.560 --> 18:59.720]  people have heard about where our contractors were putting in showers that
[18:59.720 --> 19:03.440]  ended up electrocuting the troops we have documented situations where our
[19:03.440 --> 19:09.000]  contractors were providing the water in 120 degree heat that that the troops
[19:09.000 --> 19:12.600]  used that was poison water it was dirtier than the Euphrates River and
[19:12.600 --> 19:16.680]  and these are shocking things that really did happen because these
[19:16.680 --> 19:21.120]  contractors are completely unscrupulous and they're only in it for a buck as
[19:21.120 --> 19:26.360]  as president Lincoln said during the Civil War people like that are worse
[19:26.360 --> 19:33.040]  than people who commit treason worse than traders they act surreptitiously and
[19:33.040 --> 19:37.800]  they end up not only overcharging us but literally killing our troops well
[19:37.800 --> 19:45.560]  now Blackwater USA XZ and not just all the federal filings of murder teams and
[19:45.560 --> 19:51.000]  and intimidation is reportedly killing their own people but it's confirmed LA
[19:51.000 --> 19:57.120]  Times they're now assisting police in marijuana dispensary raids well you
[19:57.120 --> 20:00.760]  know anybody who cares anything about freedom about liberty about simple
[20:00.760 --> 20:05.640]  fiscal responsibility has to be shocked by what we're seeing here every day it's
[20:05.640 --> 20:13.080]  true across the board these people and have no conscience congressman since
[20:13.080 --> 20:17.240]  Halliburton and and XZ and all of them have moved offshore now will they ever
[20:17.240 --> 20:21.120]  be brought to justice or will they just now occupy the United States and eat
[20:21.120 --> 20:24.840]  out our substance well the one thing we can do is we can cut them off when it
[20:24.840 --> 20:31.000]  comes to getting our money I was really excited and happy to find out that we
[20:31.000 --> 20:34.880]  passed that that we've been able to do something about that now because in this
[20:34.880 --> 20:38.960]  bill that was provided to the house that vote was voted on overwhelmingly last
[20:38.960 --> 20:43.320]  week to cut off funding to acorn the same bill cuts off funding to any
[20:43.320 --> 20:47.440]  organization that has filed a fraudulent form within a federal or state
[20:47.440 --> 20:52.000]  regulatory agency I noticed that I immediately put up a website and invited
[20:52.000 --> 20:57.080]  people to nominate corrupt contractors who have filed fraudulent forms with the
[20:57.080 --> 21:01.640]  federal government our list is well over 200 and growing well that is really
[21:01.640 --> 21:06.080]  smart I can you give us the the website sir I'll get the website for you I'll
[21:06.080 --> 21:11.040]  try to give you information about the website but what the main thing I'm
[21:11.040 --> 21:13.720]  is that we're going to keep the pressure on make sure they don't change this
[21:13.720 --> 21:18.880]  because you know the leadership of the both sides both parties are
[21:18.880 --> 21:22.080]  inevitably going to be hearing from these corrupt defense contractors who
[21:22.080 --> 21:25.280]  cheated us out of hundreds of millions and even billions of dollars and they're
[21:25.280 --> 21:30.440]  going to say please please have mercy on us even if they do that this way I say
[21:30.440 --> 21:35.600]  cut them off start over again well absolutely now there are more contractors
[21:35.600 --> 21:39.040]  in Iraq and there are troops and and that's what I like is that you're
[21:39.040 --> 21:42.640]  nonpartisan you just exposed the corruption right across the board
[21:42.640 --> 21:46.880]  that's a great point I mean acorn is definitely a big-setting machine very
[21:46.880 --> 21:51.720]  seedy but that's what I was thinking last week watching foxes they they love
[21:51.720 --> 21:56.840]  it they can focus on that one area of corruption and then ignore Halliburton
[21:56.840 --> 22:02.040]  that the Chicago Tribune reported kidnaps people and runs run slave factories
[22:02.040 --> 22:06.720]  according to the project on government oversight every single one of the top
[22:06.720 --> 22:10.800]  10 contractors have been found guilty not just accused of but actually found
[22:10.800 --> 22:15.120]  guilty of filing fraudulent forms with the government the tune of at least half
[22:15.120 --> 22:19.880]  a billion dollars or more so I think we're finally reached a point now we're
[22:19.880 --> 22:23.280]  gonna actually do something about it and I say that's great let's stop the
[22:23.280 --> 22:27.840]  fraud let's stop the cheating let's start over again well speaking of cheating
[22:27.840 --> 22:32.520]  the ring leaders as you know are the private corporations the brokerage
[22:32.520 --> 22:36.680]  firms and banks have a revolving door into the regulators who have created
[22:36.680 --> 22:41.240]  tens of trillions and fiat derivatives and now have us bailing them out and
[22:41.240 --> 22:45.080]  then we get to pay interest on the money we bail them out with as they loan it
[22:45.080 --> 22:50.040]  back to us where is the audit of the Fed going I read it's got 290 sponsors in
[22:50.040 --> 22:54.360]  the house sir will we be able to audit the secretive private consortium
[22:54.360 --> 22:57.440]  well it certainly is looking that way and it's because of a lot of hard work
[22:57.440 --> 23:01.240]  that we did I took that bill which traditionally been thought of as a
[23:01.240 --> 23:05.640]  republican bill and I took that bill around to my democratic colleagues on
[23:05.640 --> 23:10.000]  the floor of the house week after week after week for months and got over a
[23:10.000 --> 23:13.560]  hundred of them to sign up for that bill and make it a bipartisan bill now with
[23:13.560 --> 23:18.760]  435 members of the house over 290 yesterday the count was 292
[23:18.760 --> 23:23.360]  of us more than two-thirds of the house is signed on to that bill not just
[23:23.360 --> 23:27.080]  saying that they're going to vote for it but actually sponsoring it so I'm very
[23:27.080 --> 23:32.680]  encouraged the bill was originally filed in 1983 by Ron Paul Dr. Paul filed that
[23:32.680 --> 23:39.840]  bill when I was still in school and here we are many many many years later more
[23:39.840 --> 23:42.840]  of the years that I care to think about and the bill is finally going to have a
[23:42.840 --> 23:46.880]  hearing tomorrow tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock we're going to have a hearing
[23:46.880 --> 23:51.600]  after 26 years on this bill and it's going to reach the floor of the house
[23:51.600 --> 23:56.640]  and it's going to pass so I think this is great news we need this so badly when
[23:56.640 --> 24:02.640]  Bernanke last came to testify we it lit up the internet when he testified that
[24:02.640 --> 24:09.080]  he had given a half a trillion dollars think about this 500 million dollars
[24:09.080 --> 24:13.480]  half a trillion dollars to foreigners and he didn't know who got the money
[24:13.480 --> 24:18.320]  five hundred billion five hundred billion dollars which is five hundred
[24:18.320 --> 24:23.000]  thousand million that's what we're talking about here we're talking about an
[24:23.000 --> 24:26.440]  enormous staggering amount of money almost two thousand dollars for every
[24:26.440 --> 24:31.200]  single American and the fell reserve handed out to foreign central banks and
[24:31.200 --> 24:34.920]  I said who did they give it to he said I don't know I don't know who they gave it
[24:34.920 --> 24:40.880]  to which of course is a complete lie it actually leaked on the major papers the
[24:40.880 --> 24:45.440]  French banks the German banks the British banks we were financing we that
[24:45.440 --> 24:50.880]  the u.s. taxpayers were financing bailouts to virtually every single big
[24:50.880 --> 24:56.720]  foreign company in the world but not to our own because if you need a bailout
[24:56.720 --> 25:02.440]  here in America you could go to hell we we set up the Federal Reserve in our
[25:02.440 --> 25:08.160]  name as u.s. taxpayers set up a credit line equal to three thousand dollars for
[25:08.160 --> 25:15.080]  every single person in New Zealand in New Zealand where was our credit line we
[25:15.080 --> 25:18.440]  had small businesses who couldn't get any loans we thought small business who
[25:18.440 --> 25:22.000]  can't get any loans we had people losing their homes because they couldn't
[25:22.000 --> 25:25.920]  refinance their mortgages well clearly so there was a lot of money to people in
[25:25.920 --> 25:30.040]  New Zealand well clearly I mean you agree that that's the classic banking scam
[25:30.040 --> 25:35.400]  they make their real profits when people implode they export the money and then
[25:35.400 --> 25:42.480]  freeze assets and and and capital here so that the economy on Main Street further
[25:42.480 --> 25:47.680]  folds so they can then come in the banks flush with cash buy up banks insurance
[25:47.680 --> 25:53.320]  companies and consolidate the economy that's exactly right and and it's a
[25:53.320 --> 25:56.760]  it's a horror show for the ordinary American and what's happened here is that
[25:56.760 --> 26:02.600]  the banks have taken Uncle Sam and made him his uncle set Wow they've treated us
[26:02.600 --> 26:08.360]  like saps for too long and this is what this order is going to expose now they've
[26:08.360 --> 26:12.160]  hired a bunch of high-powered lobbying firms as you know Congressman Grayson
[26:12.160 --> 26:15.480]  we're talking about I know I know yes as a matter of fact that the first they
[26:15.480 --> 26:19.560]  hired and runs lobbyists and why not if you're doing and run accounting why
[26:19.560 --> 26:23.960]  would you hire and runs lobbyists and that's lobbyists this lobbyists issue
[26:23.960 --> 26:27.360]  a statement saying these people who support this bill to audit the reserve
[26:27.360 --> 26:31.320]  they don't understand economics well it's a funny thing to say to me because I
[26:31.320 --> 26:35.080]  actually worked for years as an economist before I I graduated from
[26:35.080 --> 26:40.000]  law school oh they don't know the difference between monetarism and
[26:40.000 --> 26:43.640]  and physical policy and didn't have the other thing and here I am the only
[26:43.640 --> 26:48.960]  member of Congress who actually worked as an economist and this lobbyist is
[26:48.960 --> 26:55.200]  K Street or is trying to teach me about economics and all of us this K Street
[26:55.200 --> 26:58.920]  whore is trying to teach me about economics so who was that particular K
[26:58.920 --> 27:03.440]  Street whore well yeah I don't remember her name this is several months ago but
[27:03.440 --> 27:07.800]  you can look it up the lobbyist who is the head lobbyist friend Ron was hired
[27:07.800 --> 27:11.640]  with our taxpayer money to try to spend this office effort to get
[27:11.640 --> 27:17.840]  transparency at the Federal Reserve and by the way yes for the website you can
[27:17.840 --> 27:23.760]  go to Grayson dot house dot gov Grayson dot house dot gov that's our website and
[27:23.760 --> 27:27.360]  and there'll be a link to the list and I hope people will go and nominate
[27:27.360 --> 27:31.040]  companies that have cheated the government and need to be debarred from
[27:31.040 --> 27:38.160]  federal contractings they stopped stealing from us congressman what is the
[27:38.160 --> 27:43.960]  game plan how do we make sure we get this out of the Fed the Senate as you
[27:43.960 --> 27:53.720]  know blocked discussion of the bill brought forward by senator DeMint how
[27:53.720 --> 27:59.400]  do we procedurally ensure that the will of the people in the house now that
[27:59.400 --> 28:03.640]  override majority in the house be able to bring this up to a vote and then
[28:03.640 --> 28:07.400]  audit these people we need a steady drumbeat in the Senate once we get
[28:07.400 --> 28:09.960]  this bill through the house we're not there yet but we are going to be there
[28:09.960 --> 28:12.720]  soon I think before the end of the year we're going to see a vote on this bill
[28:12.720 --> 28:17.000]  on the floor and of course we'll pass overwhelmingly maybe even unanimously and
[28:17.000 --> 28:21.560]  then that will create momentum to try to get this bill for the house is already
[28:21.560 --> 28:26.440]  close to 30 sponsors sorry in the Senate is close to 30 sponsors already in the
[28:26.440 --> 28:32.440]  Senate and we need to keep up a steady drumbeat when I was going around from
[28:32.440 --> 28:34.960]  person to person on the Democratic side of the house
[28:34.960 --> 28:38.840]  signing people up to co-sponsor this bill I often heard oh yeah I've had
[28:38.840 --> 28:41.920]  people write to me about that bill many times but I didn't really understand it
[28:41.920 --> 28:45.960]  we've got to do the same thing in the Senate we've got at people right we've
[28:45.960 --> 28:49.400]  got at people meet you can call up at your congressman and you can ask for
[28:49.400 --> 28:52.760]  meeting with the staff you can call up your senator and do the same thing it
[28:52.760 --> 28:56.600]  doesn't even have to be in Washington it can be where you live because wherever
[28:56.600 --> 29:00.680]  you live there's a district office or a state office and if you sit down with
[29:00.680 --> 29:05.040]  the staff and say this matters so much to me because it matters to my future the
[29:05.040 --> 29:08.600]  future of my children my grandchildren I need to tell you about this I didn't
[29:08.600 --> 29:11.840]  want to just send an email I wanted to meet with somebody and if you have to
[29:11.840 --> 29:15.200]  speak to the staff who's in charge of financial issues you can make an
[29:15.200 --> 29:18.760]  impression we had people doing that over and over and over again and it made my
[29:18.760 --> 29:23.120]  job to sign up co-sponsors among the Democrats much easier and it's a
[29:23.120 --> 29:27.080]  formula that we've repeated again and again sure sure congressman we've got
[29:27.080 --> 29:29.720]  a break it's a three-minute break can you come back on the other side and do
[29:29.720 --> 29:33.560]  five minutes with us and finish up I'm not sure I'll check I hope I can I'll

[36:01.400 --> 36:04.760]  doesn't make me mad when the military and the police try to set me up
[36:04.760 --> 36:09.560]  strangely enough when i get attacked it doesn't really make me mad it makes me
[36:09.560 --> 36:15.000]  sad for you but when you start messing with my people it makes me get hot i

[42:00.360 --> 42:03.800]  haven't looked into the mind of the system you're serving I've been studying
[42:03.800 --> 42:08.960]  this for almost well more than 16 years but on the air for almost 14 and I have
[42:08.960 --> 42:13.400]  gained a knowledge of this and let me tell you something you don't have any
[42:13.400 --> 42:17.240]  idea what real evil is you think it's tough you think it's sexy you think it's
[42:17.240 --> 42:20.840]  cute you think it's cute to torture people you think it's cute to shoot
[42:20.840 --> 42:24.760]  families and watch them blow apart and shoot their cars up in Baghdad and laugh
[42:24.760 --> 42:31.880]  at the dead kids rolling out you dumb bastards and you wrap yourselves in the
[42:31.880 --> 42:41.760]  flag you have no idea what you're part of you have no idea what you have now
[42:41.760 --> 42:47.680]  dove into the water you're in you have no idea what swimming in there with you
[42:47.680 --> 42:53.360]  if you could only know and you can if you study this and ask God to give you
[42:53.360 --> 42:59.520]  discernment but let me tell you be ready because every time I start talking
[42:59.520 --> 43:04.720]  about this and thinking about this I get chills all over my body I got chills
[43:04.720 --> 43:12.040]  right now a lot of you are already walking dead I've not seen no group that
[43:12.040 --> 43:16.680]  they shoot up worse than the troops they shoot you up with soft kills and if you
[43:16.680 --> 43:19.880]  don't know what a soft kill is or a binary weapon you better find out quick
[43:19.880 --> 43:26.200]  and you better try to detox yourself now before the damage continues God I
[43:26.200 --> 43:36.600]  wish you knew I'm gonna cover when we start the next hour the police state
[43:36.600 --> 43:39.600]  control grid and what happened to our people we're gonna be on with us in the
[43:39.600 --> 43:42.440]  last hour today
[43:42.440 --> 43:57.400]  ah I'm gonna cover it all but I first want to play this clip of Senator
[43:57.400 --> 44:03.680]  Feingold who's certainly not perfect but he really does tell the truth about
[44:03.680 --> 44:08.680]  sneak and peek searches being used for regular crimes now when he's talking to
[44:08.680 --> 44:13.280]  one of the government lawyers in this hearing the government lawyer is saying
[44:13.280 --> 44:18.760]  well the senator you notice is saying well to the sneak and peek sneak in
[44:18.760 --> 44:22.440]  in people's houses has been used in non-terror related and the guy goes well
[44:22.440 --> 44:27.360]  of course the statute was written that it's non-terror and Feingold goes yeah
[44:27.360 --> 44:31.800]  but it was sold as for terror and see that's what I mean I wrote the analysis
[44:31.800 --> 44:36.920]  of Patriot Act 1 and 2 I won second place or was it third place I forget
[44:36.920 --> 44:41.120]  of second place for the project censored awards they have 25 places pretty big
[44:41.120 --> 44:48.320]  deal from Sonoma State University but I win that in 2002 I don't know it was on
[44:48.320 --> 44:52.240]  free speech TV I went out there and have speech it's in matrix of evil but the
[44:52.240 --> 44:55.360]  point is is I'm I'm no lawyer but I understand this stuff and I spent
[44:55.360 --> 44:59.520]  several days reading the bill and I wrote the analysis and I went to section
[44:59.520 --> 45:04.040]  213 and it says for any crime any investigation any misdemeanor we break
[45:04.040 --> 45:08.040]  in your house without warrants and spy on you and they have snatch and grab
[45:08.040 --> 45:15.680]  provisions in Patriot Act 2 and they have and section 802 states that the
[45:15.680 --> 45:20.520]  Patriot Act can be used for any misdemeanor any crime that in that
[45:20.520 --> 45:27.560]  violates any federal or state law that endangers human life and go read it they
[45:27.560 --> 45:31.440]  change the definition from threatening violence or carrying out violence for
[45:31.440 --> 45:35.360]  political aim or taking hostages you know the classic definition and it
[45:35.360 --> 45:40.120]  strikes those and says all misdemeanors and then the feds tried to pass in
[45:40.120 --> 45:44.000]  Washington State and Rhode Island just two places and we it came out in the
[45:44.000 --> 45:47.040]  news that when the state senators and governors would get in trouble when
[45:47.040 --> 45:50.240]  people read the bills they'd say well the feds asked me to pass this and it was
[45:50.240 --> 45:55.280]  a copy of the Patriot Act but it said if you protest life in prison in a forced
[45:55.280 --> 45:59.960]  labor camp if you desecrate the American flag including having it on cups or
[45:59.960 --> 46:04.800]  napkins life in prison forced labor camp you can go read the bills it said if
[46:04.800 --> 46:09.280]  you intimidate a state or federal official if you protest them life in
[46:09.280 --> 46:14.320]  prison forced labor camp it says forced labor camp one of the senators menace
[46:14.320 --> 46:18.880]  bill it almost passed that was in the Oregonian and AP I mean you can't make
[46:18.880 --> 46:22.560]  this up so I knew all this but I want you to know it's a hundred times worse
[46:22.560 --> 46:28.240]  than senator Feingold is saying here this thing says all misdemeanors are in
[46:28.240 --> 46:33.960]  act of terrorism so see you can go find articles from every major state just
[46:33.960 --> 46:40.480]  search the term Patriot Act used for regular crimes or non-terror issues and
[46:40.480 --> 46:45.040]  you'll see different states I've seen headlines like 20 plus thousand people
[46:45.040 --> 46:49.800]  had the Patriot Act used on them for drunk driving and marijuana crimes or
[46:49.800 --> 46:55.640]  CPS using Patriot Act the thing was written for you homeland security was
[46:55.640 --> 47:05.560]  written for you everything was written for the American people everything the
[47:05.560 --> 47:10.680]  DHS report gun owners veterans liberals conservatives libertarians bob bar
[47:10.680 --> 47:15.000]  supporters Ron Paul supporters anyone who protests the Fed we got the secret
[47:15.000 --> 47:19.000]  army documents then it became mainstream news that the army watches Ron Paul his
[47:19.000 --> 47:23.120]  brother me I told you I've had the army follow me around for years they've
[47:23.120 --> 47:28.680]  threatened me in parking lots and you know when these guys come up and get in
[47:28.680 --> 47:35.240]  my face twice block my car in and they're there special forces types these
[47:35.240 --> 47:39.080]  aren't just your average stupid you know our dumbed-down weekend warriors I'm
[47:39.080 --> 47:42.080]  not saying you're bad you know I mean kind of doe-eyed not know what's going
[47:42.080 --> 47:45.920]  on their predatory they think they're tough they're into being into precision

[47:49.040 --> 47:54.200]  now in America and they let me know we're watching your ass you ever try
[47:54.200 --> 47:57.160]  anything violent we're gonna get you and I'm like what the hell is your problem
[47:57.160 --> 48:02.160]  and I and in both cases I said go take some more vaccines and get out of my
[48:02.160 --> 48:07.360]  face I feel sorry for you and I do I feel sorry for him you think you're so

[48:16.480 --> 48:20.800]  you don't have the mental strength you are in an adolescent child psychology
[48:20.800 --> 48:24.120]  arrested development where you like being patted on the head by the big guys
[48:24.120 --> 48:29.160]  in the uniforms you like being sent out like hunting dogs sociologist
[48:29.160 --> 48:32.680]  psychologist and many statesmen have pointed out for thousands of years that
[48:32.680 --> 48:36.800]  it takes more courage to go against the pack and against authorities and against
[48:36.800 --> 48:39.960]  your bosses just like the German soldiers followed orders and the high
[48:39.960 --> 48:43.800]  command followed orders it takes more courage to say no to illegal and
[48:43.800 --> 48:49.440]  unlawful crap than it does to charge machine gun nest you you want to have
[48:49.440 --> 48:54.320]  real courage I know I'm telling the truth and I know I'm right about what I'm
[48:54.320 --> 48:59.040]  covering and if you just look at what I'm claiming you'd find out I'm the best
[48:59.040 --> 49:03.960]  friend you ever had and I'm sick of the death threats and I'm sick of your

[54:11.160 --> 54:15.920]  listen to the radio Chris let me start by reiterating something you and I've
[54:15.920 --> 54:20.520]  talked about previously and that's my concern the critical information about
[54:20.520 --> 54:24.640]  the implementation of the Patriot Act has not been made public information that
[54:24.640 --> 54:29.120]  I believe would have a significant impact on the debate I urge you to move
[54:29.120 --> 54:32.960]  expeditiously on the request that I and others in this committee have made before
[54:32.960 --> 54:38.400]  the legislative process is over now in Suzanne Spaulding's testimony for the
[54:38.400 --> 54:42.600]  next panel she argues that additional safeguards are needed in the context of
[54:42.600 --> 54:47.400]  intelligence investigations because of the very broad scope of intelligence
[54:47.400 --> 54:51.800]  investigations the secrecy with which they must be conducted and the fact that
[54:51.800 --> 54:57.720]  they often do not lead to prosecution that is we have to take into account that
[54:57.720 --> 55:01.560]  safeguards inherent to criminal investigations are simply not always
[55:01.560 --> 55:06.000]  present in the context of intelligence investigations Mr. Chris do you agree
[55:06.000 --> 55:10.600]  that additional vigilance is needed in the context of intelligence
[55:10.600 --> 55:15.880]  investigations yes and in fact isn't that what was demonstrated at least in
[55:15.880 --> 55:22.000]  part by the IG reports on national security letters well I think the
[55:22.000 --> 55:27.240]  problems that Mr. Fine found are significant I think they've been
[55:27.240 --> 55:32.000]  remedied I'm not sure that those are inherent in an intelligence use of NSLs
[55:32.000 --> 55:35.680]  but I mean certainly they are significant and they warrant attention and I
[55:35.680 --> 55:38.360]  think they've gotten a lot of attention Mr. Fine would you agree that the lack
[55:38.360 --> 55:43.280]  of safeguards contributed to the misuse of NSLs I think to some extent the fact
[55:43.280 --> 55:47.160]  that they were not transparent does produce an environment where there
[55:47.160 --> 55:51.720]  needs to be more significant vigilance Mr. Chris as you know the Patriot Act
[55:51.720 --> 55:55.480]  provided statutory authority for the government to obtain a special sneak and
[55:55.480 --> 55:59.280]  peek criminal search warrant so that allow agents to break into Americans
[55:59.280 --> 56:03.320]  homes and conduct secret searches without telling them for weeks months or even
[56:03.320 --> 56:08.280]  longer it is true isn't it that these searches can be conducted also in run of
[56:08.280 --> 56:13.520]  the mill criminal cases and do not require any connection to terrorism that's
[56:13.520 --> 56:17.880]  true both before act according to a July 2009 report of the administrative law
[56:17.880 --> 56:21.680]  system of the US courts isn't that exactly how this authority has most
[56:21.680 --> 56:26.080]  recently been used the report shows that in fiscal year 2008 sneak and peek
[56:26.080 --> 56:31.080]  search warrants were requested 763 times but only three of those initial
[56:31.080 --> 56:37.200]  requests just three were in terrorism cases the vast majority were for drug
[56:37.200 --> 56:41.040]  cases now is that your understanding of that report and does it concern you at
[56:41.040 --> 56:45.200]  all it is my understanding and I want to say thank you to your staff who
[56:45.200 --> 56:50.200]  alerted me and allowed me to read the report in advance of this hearing it
[56:50.200 --> 56:55.680]  does say here that 65% of the these are criminal sneak and peek were in drug
[56:55.680 --> 56:59.640]  cases obviously just to make something clear which I know you understand that
[56:59.640 --> 57:05.440]  on the FISA side the searches that we do pursuant to FISA are not exactly sneak
[57:05.440 --> 57:10.680]  and peek they're generally covert all together so this authority here on the
[57:10.680 --> 57:15.200]  sneak and peek side on the criminal side is is not meant for intelligence it's
[57:15.200 --> 57:21.200]  for criminal cases so I guess it's not surprising to me that it applies in in
[57:21.200 --> 57:25.880]  drug case I recall it was in something called the USA Patriot Act which was
[57:25.880 --> 57:30.480]  passed in a rush after an attack on 9-11 that had to do a terrorism it didn't
[57:30.480 --> 57:33.960]  have to do a regular run of the mill criminal cases let me tell you why I'm
[57:33.960 --> 57:38.040]  concerned about these numbers that's not how this was sold to the American
[57:38.040 --> 57:43.920]  people it was sold as stated on DOJ's website in 2005 as being necessary quote
[57:43.920 --> 57:48.400]  to conduct investigations without tipping off terrorists I'm going to say it's
[57:48.400 --> 57:52.920]  quite extraordinary to grant government agents the statutory authority to
[57:52.920 --> 57:56.200]  secretly break into Americans homes and criminal cases and I think some
[57:56.200 --> 57:59.920]  Americans might be concerned that it's been used hundreds of times in just a
[57:59.920 --> 58:03.920]  single year in non-terrorism cases and that that's why I'm proposing additional
[58:03.920 --> 58:07.840]  safeguards to make sure that this authority is available where necessary
[58:07.840 --> 58:13.360]  but not in virtually every criminal case and also to shorten the time period for
[58:13.360 --> 58:17.480]  notification well I don't mean to quibble with you I do want to just point out one
[58:17.480 --> 58:21.360]  thing which is I mean what before and I was trying to carve out FISA just to
[58:21.360 --> 58:26.640]  clarify that FISA is a different authority where it is covert and also if
[58:26.640 --> 58:30.760]  it's if I'm correct on this I believe two courts of appeals prior to the
[58:30.760 --> 58:34.160]  Patriot Act had authorized sneak and peek under existing law this was yes
[58:34.160 --> 58:38.400]  meant to be a codification there you go that's like saying Hitler was killing
[58:38.400 --> 58:49.640]  people so it's okay thank you for listening to GCN visit GCN Live.com today
[58:49.640 --> 58:53.880]  hello friends this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this

[1:02:25.520 --> 1:02:28.600]  here we're not going to talk to you and then they call a false report in the
[1:02:28.600 --> 1:02:32.040]  police saying they were out there sneaking around the perimeter wouldn't
[1:02:32.040 --> 1:02:38.880]  give them ID and ran total lie I was on the phone with them trying to give the
[1:02:38.880 --> 1:02:45.040]  phone to the military this is how America operates they just lie out of hand
[1:02:45.040 --> 1:02:48.880]  it's like the New York police on video and truth rising with Luke Radowski
[1:02:48.880 --> 1:02:52.640]  coming up saying stop protesting I don't care if you have a permit or allowed to

[1:08:15.600 --> 1:08:20.000]  becoming quite fashionable to attack the Federal Reserve sir Palin on her
[1:08:20.000 --> 1:08:25.920]  trip to Hong Kong dead you see we've now identified the real government and
[1:08:25.920 --> 1:08:29.680]  Republicans and Democrats the leadership are nothing but cons they play a
[1:08:29.680 --> 1:08:33.640]  projection they put up in our face to distract us and divert us from the real
[1:08:33.640 --> 1:08:38.280]  actions in the true halls of power that are taking place and that's why the
[1:08:38.280 --> 1:08:42.080]  Federal Reserve has trained the military and police and put out DHS and state
[1:08:42.080 --> 1:08:46.000]  reports saying that if you criticize the Federal Reserve you're a terrorist
[1:08:46.000 --> 1:08:49.440]  that's why the Defense Department and the Justice Department mainstream news
[1:08:49.440 --> 1:08:54.160]  from a month ago have put out reports saying all protests is a form of quote
[1:08:54.160 --> 1:09:01.720]  low-level terrorism and they teach the military and the police to cross train
[1:09:01.720 --> 1:09:06.640]  together all over the country that anybody protesting as a terrorist and
[1:09:06.640 --> 1:09:14.560]  then in Seattle in 99 in Denver in 2008 in Canada in 2008 and Ottawa there's
[1:09:14.560 --> 1:09:19.040]  many other examples in England at the G20 this year it came out mainstream news
[1:09:19.040 --> 1:09:23.840]  that the police dressed up like anarchist knocked out windows attacked
[1:09:23.840 --> 1:09:27.320]  other police officers that didn't even know what was happening the commanders
[1:09:27.320 --> 1:09:31.920]  did and order the police the riot police to stand down while bottles and rocks
[1:09:31.920 --> 1:09:36.920]  are hitting them and while police dressed up like anarchists run up and hit
[1:09:36.920 --> 1:09:40.440]  them on the head with rocks now when you watch these videos we're always able to
[1:09:40.440 --> 1:09:44.120]  point out that they're fake that it's staged and then later it comes out that
[1:09:44.120 --> 1:09:49.360]  it's staged in the mainstream news in the Toronto Sun Toronto Star excuse me in
[1:09:49.360 --> 1:09:52.800]  the Denver Post and the Seattle Post intelligence sir in the Seattle Times
[1:09:52.800 --> 1:09:57.240]  these are all mainstream news articles but I can always watch the video before
[1:09:57.240 --> 1:10:01.360]  it comes out two or three weeks later that royal amount of police apologize and
[1:10:01.360 --> 1:10:05.120]  are investigating who ordered their police to dress up like anarchist and
[1:10:05.120 --> 1:10:09.080]  attack other police Denver Police Department is investigating who ordered
[1:10:09.080 --> 1:10:12.440]  their police to dress up like anarchist and attack other police yeah right
[1:10:12.440 --> 1:10:16.520]  investigating themselves but I was able to look at the video in Ottawa and go
[1:10:16.520 --> 1:10:20.360]  look the anarchists are all wearing police boots with the same yellow logo on
[1:10:20.360 --> 1:10:24.560]  the heel these are big guys these aren't little anarchist meth heads the real
[1:10:24.560 --> 1:10:27.560]  ones and I'm not saying you're all like that but you know what I'm talking about
[1:10:27.560 --> 1:10:32.120]  anybody's been out these protests that face meth heads these are big guys and
[1:10:32.120 --> 1:10:36.840]  they're running up and hitting you know it's like pro wrestling they put on a
[1:10:36.840 --> 1:10:40.840]  big show they're hitting them hard but the hand slows down right when they hit
[1:10:40.840 --> 1:10:46.160]  the cop on the head with the rock on the riot helmet it's like watching Hulk
[1:10:46.160 --> 1:10:49.760]  Hogan and Andre the Giant when they're fake stomping each other in the face
[1:10:49.760 --> 1:10:55.680]  it's totally fake and I go okay those are all big guys big cops same boots and
[1:10:55.680 --> 1:10:59.480]  they're not really hitting those police hard now in Seattle they actually
[1:10:59.480 --> 1:11:04.160]  broke a cop's nose with a bottle because that was the army was running that they
[1:11:04.160 --> 1:11:08.320]  had very hardcore operators doing that and the cops were like getting really
[1:11:08.320 --> 1:11:11.280]  mad saying why can't we defend ourselves and the commanders were like
[1:11:11.280 --> 1:11:14.920]  stand down stand down and the police are in my film police state to the
[1:11:14.920 --> 1:11:18.720]  takeover going yeah we were ordered to stand there and watch as they looted
[1:11:18.720 --> 1:11:25.920]  Nike town and attacked us and it came out that it was it was it was feds when
[1:11:25.920 --> 1:11:30.400]  it's cops attacking cops it's it's it's it's like pro wrestling and you'll see
[1:11:30.400 --> 1:11:36.960]  the cops when they're getting kicked or hit like putting their hands out like
[1:11:36.960 --> 1:11:43.800]  why are you doing this you know in the universal sign language for questioning
[1:11:43.800 --> 1:11:49.160]  and we confirmed in Denver ourselves and we said on air we had suspicions
[1:11:49.160 --> 1:11:55.120]  that we talked to a bunch of media media at like 6 a.m. at this square right by
[1:11:55.120 --> 1:12:00.120]  the Capitol different radio stations that were interviewing us local talk we
[1:12:00.120 --> 1:12:02.640]  would go down there at 8 9 o'clock different mornings be interviewed by
[1:12:02.640 --> 1:12:07.160]  them that was kind of the center of the protest and I was told by local news
[1:12:07.160 --> 1:12:13.520]  reporters they said yeah no we saw Marines get out of their car get out of
[1:12:13.520 --> 1:12:18.840]  white vans and change clothes in the vans in and out of the vans and then run
[1:12:18.840 --> 1:12:24.920]  off and join anarchist and then Luke Radowski was another protest we were in
[1:12:24.920 --> 1:12:28.760]  the RV driving around and missed it but he said yeah it looked like it was fake
[1:12:28.760 --> 1:12:32.120]  these big guys dressed like anarchists were coming up yelling and screaming
[1:12:32.120 --> 1:12:36.280]  hitting cops and pushing police and that ended up being on Fox News the day
[1:12:36.280 --> 1:12:40.680]  before the official Democratic National Convention started for four days that
[1:12:40.680 --> 1:12:46.400]  was on the Monday or was it a Sunday I forget and we said it looked like it was
[1:12:46.400 --> 1:12:49.880]  provocateur watching Fox News of the video then looking at Luke's video but
[1:12:49.880 --> 1:12:54.000]  we couldn't prove it because the anarchists will attack and then slip
[1:12:54.000 --> 1:12:58.840]  behind a police line and the cops stop you but then it came out that was stage
[1:12:58.840 --> 1:13:03.160]  that first event to show the demonstrators is violent and bad to
[1:13:03.160 --> 1:13:06.960]  set the precedent to say well that's why we got 2,500 troops that's why we got
[1:13:06.960 --> 1:13:12.400]  tens of thousands of police and we've got our teams on the ground three people
[1:13:12.400 --> 1:13:18.840]  split up surveilling the anarchists surveilling the incredible Hulk
[1:13:18.840 --> 1:13:23.600]  anarchists as I call them that you know the cops dressed up and I know that
[1:13:23.600 --> 1:13:27.600]  there's over 60 plus activists from the different change groups and 911 truth
[1:13:27.600 --> 1:13:31.600]  groups when I say 60 that's a conservative number that are there on the
[1:13:31.600 --> 1:13:38.880]  ground in hotels in condo balconies on the street in taxis in buses and I've
[1:13:38.880 --> 1:13:44.080]  told everybody just when you see anarchist bust out a window or do
[1:13:44.080 --> 1:13:48.000]  something don't point your cameras directly at them I mean film them while
[1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:52.680]  they're doing it and then quietly follow of them because you will follow them
[1:13:52.680 --> 1:13:57.200]  back to a police station or back to a foundation funded bivouac warehouse or
[1:13:57.200 --> 1:14:01.560]  facility and then we've got them and we're now starting to catch them
[1:14:01.560 --> 1:14:04.840]  because we know their tactics and I I called the police department in
[1:14:04.840 --> 1:14:08.240]  Pittsburgh last night and I told them I said I know you're involved in this and
[1:14:08.240 --> 1:14:12.440]  that they were kind of shucking up by it and I said we are surveilling you for
[1:14:12.440 --> 1:14:16.440]  criminal activity so I so I kind of defeats our purpose and we were really
[1:14:16.440 --> 1:14:19.600]  trying to bust them we wouldn't let them know we're watching but we don't want
[1:14:19.600 --> 1:14:23.120]  them to be able to demonize the protesters and so we do things moral we
[1:14:23.120 --> 1:14:26.480]  let them know we're coming we let them know we're coming what we're gonna be
[1:14:26.480 --> 1:14:30.800]  doing and we just stand in the light and trust in God and I want you to pray
[1:14:30.800 --> 1:14:35.280]  for Jason Burmans Rob do and Jason Douglas that are on the ground from the
[1:14:35.280 --> 1:14:38.480]  info wars team there and all the we are change people and everybody else that
[1:14:38.480 --> 1:14:42.320]  are in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania for the G20 as open world government and the end
[1:14:42.320 --> 1:14:46.280]  of the dollar is being announced in mainstream newspapers I just read the
[1:14:46.280 --> 1:14:49.360]  headlines earlier I'm gonna go back through those articles in a little while
[1:14:49.360 --> 1:14:52.960]  we're 15 minutes away from Ron Paul he may move the interview though because
[1:14:52.960 --> 1:14:56.880]  they're in a vote right now so we need to double check that if he's still
[1:14:56.880 --> 1:15:03.240]  voting okay here is the really big news of the day
[1:15:03.240 --> 1:15:09.040]  red alert military attempts to frame info wars reporters for terrorism at G20
[1:15:09.040 --> 1:15:18.560]  summit I got a call about 10 p.m. last night from Jason Douglas he said I just
[1:15:18.560 --> 1:15:23.760]  got called by a guy who was with the army and FBI well first they called and
[1:15:23.760 --> 1:15:30.200]  said they were with Alamo rental and that the cars brakes were out that's
[1:15:30.200 --> 1:15:33.200]  gotta break laws the police to call up and say they're with another company
[1:15:33.200 --> 1:15:37.080]  you know they they got the license plate found out where it was called got the
[1:15:37.080 --> 1:15:41.680]  cell phone on the rent car call up say hi I'm with Alamo rental my name's Tom
[1:15:41.680 --> 1:15:45.320]  Watson that's that's the police officer admitted he did this you did the
[1:15:45.320 --> 1:15:50.080]  investigator and we'd like you to bring that car back over here and we'll give
[1:15:50.080 --> 1:15:53.200]  you two free days but the brakes around and then Douglas said well they've
[1:15:53.200 --> 1:15:56.540]  already cordoned off the downtown area which they just locked down right as
[1:15:56.540 --> 1:15:59.520]  they got back through it and he said I'll have to bring it into Mara and the
[1:15:59.520 --> 1:16:03.120]  guy just changed and said look you're in a terrorist database now you're never
[1:16:03.120 --> 1:16:08.600]  gonna get off the list we know you're a terrorist and Douglas said he couldn't
[1:16:08.600 --> 1:16:14.320]  talk he was like excuse me what what cuz cuz Douglas had told him oh no we're
[1:16:14.320 --> 1:16:17.960]  with info wars.com and we're here covering the G20 and we can't get out
[1:16:17.960 --> 1:16:22.360]  of the cordon he told him that and the guy just shifted gears and said well we
[1:16:22.360 --> 1:16:25.560]  put you on a terror database you're never getting off of it sort of laughing
[1:16:25.560 --> 1:16:29.120]  with pleasure at the false witness and the setup and everything that was
[1:16:29.120 --> 1:16:33.360]  happening according to Douglas and I called the guy he admitted to a lot of
[1:16:33.360 --> 1:16:37.920]  it but didn't admit to all of it and I'll give you his side of the story and
[1:16:37.920 --> 1:16:42.120]  he and he said well you ran from the military you were caught sneaking around
[1:16:42.120 --> 1:16:45.560]  the perimeter well they drove up the front gate so we like to speak to your
[1:16:45.560 --> 1:16:47.680]  public information officer we like to interview him or find out when we can
[1:16:47.680 --> 1:16:51.400]  interview him tomorrow that's standard procedure they said we don't believe your
[1:16:51.400 --> 1:16:55.720]  real media even though they gave them the info wars press passes which of
[1:16:55.720 --> 1:17:00.160]  course we're media they said we want to talk to your boss in Austin so they
[1:17:00.160 --> 1:17:04.440]  called then the public relations officer comes over starts laughing I
[1:17:04.440 --> 1:17:08.400]  hear this on the cell phone being very rude very arrogant now maybe come back
[1:17:08.400 --> 1:17:13.040]  tomorrow we'll talk to you you know you need to get out of here you're not real
[1:17:13.040 --> 1:17:16.760]  media no I don't want to talk to him Douglas is not Douglas do's like but
[1:17:16.760 --> 1:17:21.000]  you wanted him you know here this is who we are and the guy's like yeah I
[1:17:21.000 --> 1:17:24.480]  actually went and called the number on that website nobody answered you're not
[1:17:24.480 --> 1:17:28.560]  you know just go ahead and get on out of here maybe you can come back tomorrow
[1:17:28.560 --> 1:17:31.160]  so they get in the car and leave and I've talked to him as they get in the car
[1:17:31.160 --> 1:17:34.840]  and say okay well I guess they'll show video of them setting up the cordons and
[1:17:34.840 --> 1:17:38.520]  you know get go out and in every the military tomorrow which they've now been
[1:17:38.520 --> 1:17:40.800]  able to do on the streets that that's coming up the last hour they're gonna
[1:17:40.800 --> 1:17:46.600]  report why from the G20 so complete live by the police the military saying they
[1:17:46.600 --> 1:17:51.720]  were sneaking around the perimeter videotaping they were they were they
[1:17:51.720 --> 1:17:57.520]  ran from them I mean just total lie but see that's the psychology if they have
[1:17:57.520 --> 1:18:00.760]  to lie about you to then make it psychologically okay for them to then
[1:18:00.760 --> 1:18:05.920]  abuse you and I said well why did you pose as a as an Alamo agent he said oh
[1:18:05.920 --> 1:18:10.600]  let's it's completely legal for me to do a ruse in a terrorism investigation I
[1:18:10.600 --> 1:18:13.000]  said terrorism investigation I said did you tell them they're in a terror
[1:18:13.000 --> 1:18:17.240]  database for life well I did say I forwarded it to the FBI and there is a
[1:18:17.240 --> 1:18:21.520]  terrorism investigation now so but you're not gonna be on the list for for
[1:18:21.520 --> 1:18:29.480]  life and he was kind of laughing about it and it was just so bizarre that they
[1:18:29.480 --> 1:18:32.840]  don't even think of us as human beings it's like New York in truth rising the
[1:18:32.840 --> 1:18:35.640]  video the police come over and say we know you're not a terrorist we're gonna
[1:18:35.640 --> 1:18:37.880]  say you're a terrorist and arrest you you're not allowed to protest I don't
[1:18:37.880 --> 1:18:41.120]  care if you have a permit and they grab their backpack and camera and say this
[1:18:41.120 --> 1:18:46.920]  is a gun and a bomb on video they don't even care they think it's normal to
[1:18:46.920 --> 1:18:54.000]  commit these hardcore crimes right out in the open and so if they'll frame you
[1:18:54.000 --> 1:18:58.200]  on video and say I know you're innocent but I'm now going to frame you and then
[1:18:58.200 --> 1:19:03.480]  they don't get in trouble what else will they do but think of the 1984 aspect of
[1:19:03.480 --> 1:19:08.480]  just them enjoyably saying haha I'm gonna put you on a terror list I'm gonna
[1:19:08.480 --> 1:19:12.840]  put you on the Jew roundup list like Nazi Germany I'm gonna put you on the
[1:19:12.840 --> 1:19:17.000]  communist list then you can't fly now they're saying if you're on a no fly
[1:19:17.000 --> 1:19:21.120]  list or the terror list you won't be able to buy a gun get credit and so we're
[1:19:21.120 --> 1:19:24.960]  gonna check and if Douglas ever has a problem I'm going to sue the police
[1:19:24.960 --> 1:19:31.400]  officer and I'm going to sue the FBI and I promise I'm gonna do that we have to

[1:24:43.320 --> 1:24:48.320]  government takeover happening in plain view but notice the establishment for
[1:24:48.320 --> 1:24:52.040]  decades said there's no world government no plan to have a bank of the world the
[1:24:52.040 --> 1:24:56.520]  Federal Reserve is not private everything is fine we're not going to put
[1:24:56.520 --> 1:25:00.000]  troops on the streets it's all conspiracy theory as they slowly built the
[1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:04.960]  infrastructure of control and then now they're openly announcing it but the
[1:25:04.960 --> 1:25:07.520]  general public's been conditioned to not be able to talk about it because
[1:25:07.520 --> 1:25:11.360]  that's weird you know you don't talk about a foreign corporate takeover
[1:25:11.360 --> 1:25:18.200]  because that doesn't exist ladies and gentlemen it's all over the news and
[1:25:18.200 --> 1:25:23.160]  they're now trying to push mandatory swine flu shots on the firefighters and
[1:25:23.160 --> 1:25:28.840]  police you guys think they let you carry all these crimes and violations the
[1:25:28.840 --> 1:25:32.280]  Constitution against the people but you're not going to be hurt you are the
[1:25:32.280 --> 1:25:36.040]  people they hate more than anyone they fear their enforcers throughout history
[1:25:36.040 --> 1:25:42.640]  tyrannical and despotic and oppressive systems in phases purge you and attack you
[1:25:42.640 --> 1:25:50.920]  and push you more than they do any other group you're under some very black wings
[1:25:50.920 --> 1:25:55.560]  I mean you think the system you're under is nuzzling you and suckling you and
[1:25:55.560 --> 1:26:05.880]  loving you it's doing the opposite and I pray you'll get your head screwed on
[1:26:05.880 --> 1:26:10.600]  straight but but let it sink in for everybody just how off the charts
[1:26:10.600 --> 1:26:18.680]  hardcore it is to have the military and the police putting a million two hundred
[1:26:18.680 --> 1:26:21.040]  thousand and I brought this up to the police officer over the phone he goes
[1:26:21.040 --> 1:26:24.640]  yeah I know and that was a year ago almost a year ago 10 months ago 11
[1:26:24.640 --> 1:26:28.160]  months ago it's been secret since then but they were adding 25,000 people a
[1:26:28.160 --> 1:26:34.480]  month number two years ago the Denver Post reported that the head federal
[1:26:34.480 --> 1:26:40.240]  Marshall air Marshall over the Denver sector that's over several states said
[1:26:40.240 --> 1:26:45.360]  that they're protesting that they're ordered to have a quota just Google
[1:26:45.360 --> 1:26:49.360]  air Marshall say they have a quota on watch list and they say children taking
[1:26:49.360 --> 1:26:53.200]  photographs in the airport families laughing people ordering vegetarian
[1:26:53.200 --> 1:26:57.760]  meals they're ordered to put them on a terror list for life a secret list no
[1:26:57.760 --> 1:27:02.240]  way to get off of it no way to know why you were put on it then they just set
[1:27:02.240 --> 1:27:05.600]  the precedent that millions and millions of innocent people are on it but that
[1:27:05.600 --> 1:27:08.400]  it's for your own good then they put you and your families through the naked
[1:27:08.400 --> 1:27:12.840]  body scanners and record the child porn images and the images of your wife and
[1:27:12.840 --> 1:27:17.360]  you onto their government computers now they have a biometric image of a 360 of
[1:27:17.360 --> 1:27:25.560]  your body and then it's pure terrorism psychological terror to openly say don't
[1:27:25.560 --> 1:27:28.800]  criticize the government don't get involved don't protest the Fed don't go
[1:27:28.800 --> 1:27:32.960]  to tea parties or you'll be put on a list to try to chill Americans let me tell
[1:27:32.960 --> 1:27:39.080]  you something if we give into this chilling effect if we let the system
[1:27:39.080 --> 1:27:43.920]  have their way and set the precedent that they can outside of any court outside
[1:27:43.920 --> 1:27:47.520]  of any judge in a secret system put millions of people who were innocent on
[1:27:47.520 --> 1:27:51.360]  a list including children that's in although Obama deception of four-year-old
[1:27:51.360 --> 1:27:56.840]  boy on it you can't get off and that's the end of it mainstream news and they
[1:27:56.840 --> 1:28:02.480]  laugh about it it's funny and then they say you better not criticize anything
[1:28:02.480 --> 1:28:05.600]  we're doing in this corporate takeover or we'll put you on a list and now
[1:28:05.600 --> 1:28:08.520]  they're saying if you're on the list you can't buy guns no judge no jury
[1:28:08.520 --> 1:28:13.160]  that's the no fly no buy law and the attorney general saying even if they
[1:28:13.160 --> 1:28:16.800]  don't pass the law he's just going to implement it regulatory just like to
[1:28:16.800 --> 1:28:21.560]  have a regulation for 15 million dollar fines if you sell recalled items over a
[1:28:21.560 --> 1:28:30.440]  decade old at any garage sale or flea market or bizarre or market I mean
[1:28:30.440 --> 1:28:34.000]  they're going after the Amish and farmers and ranchers selling cows
[1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:38.000]  themselves selling eggs selling squash or watermelon in the cases we've seen
[1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:42.040]  her cheese they're just they're just going crazy on us with classical
[1:28:42.040 --> 1:28:46.400]  tyranny we know what this is and they say we're gonna put you on a secret
[1:28:46.400 --> 1:28:49.360]  list and now they say we're gonna take your blood at checkpoints without a
[1:28:49.360 --> 1:28:53.120]  warrant and they oh yeah we're using the Patriot Act breaking in your home
[1:28:53.120 --> 1:28:58.160]  secretly for marijuana cases and child protective services in Texas tried to
[1:28:58.160 --> 1:29:01.800]  pass a law we narrowly defeated it where they would take your kids without even a
[1:29:01.800 --> 1:29:05.120]  judge's order with no probable cause without even telling you they took them
[1:29:05.120 --> 1:29:11.200]  and your medical records without a warrant I mean this is hardcore tyranny
[1:29:11.200 --> 1:29:14.760]  and then they intimidate you and say sit out and take it or we'll put you on a
[1:29:14.760 --> 1:29:18.040]  list if we give into this everybody goes on the list they're saying if you have
[1:29:18.040 --> 1:29:21.920]  bad credit now you're gonna go on the list that's mainstream news they're
[1:29:21.920 --> 1:29:25.400]  gonna make us all terrorists that's what this is for that's what the DHS report
[1:29:25.400 --> 1:29:28.840]  states that's what the Patriot Act section 802 states any misdemeanor
[1:29:28.840 --> 1:29:35.040]  you're a terrorist this is real ladies and gentlemen this is hardcore this is

[1:33:40.200 --> 1:33:44.960]  your book coming out in the Fed but first I've got the Times of London the
[1:33:44.960 --> 1:33:51.520]  London Telegraph AFP dollar under scrutiny at G20 summit HSBC bids farewell
[1:33:51.520 --> 1:33:56.720]  the dollar supremacy they say the world is now going to move away from the dollar
[1:33:56.720 --> 1:34:01.240]  they're announcing global governments president class your friend you've been
[1:34:01.240 --> 1:34:05.720]  over there to speak as a guest of the of the government is saying this is global
[1:34:05.720 --> 1:34:11.920]  government at the UN yesterday so people are waking up but now the
[1:34:11.920 --> 1:34:15.720]  establishment is making its move can you speak to what's happening with the
[1:34:15.720 --> 1:34:20.400]  dollar well the dollar of course today bounced up a little bit but that's just
[1:34:20.400 --> 1:34:24.880]  temporary because of some announcements but the dollar is in in bad trouble and
[1:34:24.880 --> 1:34:28.800]  they know it and a lot of people ask me exactly what's going on the G20 meetings
[1:34:28.800 --> 1:34:31.720]  and of course there are a lot of announcement I think the really big
[1:34:31.720 --> 1:34:34.720]  stuff that goes on at these beings is behind the scenes and there are no
[1:34:34.720 --> 1:34:39.480]  announcements my guess would be that behind the scenes they are really really
[1:34:39.480 --> 1:34:43.000]  making the plans for what's going to replace the dollar reserve standard
[1:34:43.000 --> 1:34:46.440]  because they're sick and tired of us getting a free ride we get to print the
[1:34:46.440 --> 1:34:49.240]  money and get to spend it they're supposed to hang on to it as if it were
[1:34:49.240 --> 1:34:55.120]  gold so but they're they're planning on something else but they have a job in
[1:34:55.120 --> 1:34:59.680]  front of them because it's not easy creating another fiat currency usually
[1:34:59.680 --> 1:35:05.320]  when a government ruins the currency they go back to something more sound and
[1:35:05.320 --> 1:35:09.280]  back their currency or make gold silver legal tender they don't want to do that
[1:35:09.280 --> 1:35:14.440]  that's why I suspect they'll move in the direction of just a new world order and
[1:35:14.440 --> 1:35:19.360]  I hear and I've heard Obama recently use that term again they got to have a new
[1:35:19.360 --> 1:35:24.440]  world order and they've been working on that for a long time and I'm sure they
[1:35:24.440 --> 1:35:28.480]  are not worried all that much about a crisis coming in they might look at it
[1:35:28.480 --> 1:35:33.480]  as an opportunity you know for promoting their cause and that's what we should be
[1:35:33.480 --> 1:35:37.080]  concerned about well that's what Congressman Grayson said last hour with
[1:35:37.080 --> 1:35:40.760]  us is that the banks he believes have engineered this to create a crisis to
[1:35:40.760 --> 1:35:44.320]  vertically integrate society and then they offer the solution as this new
[1:35:44.320 --> 1:35:48.560]  bank of the world that will fund itself off carbon taxes and Tobin taxes Al
[1:35:48.560 --> 1:35:52.520]  Gore's called for that Gordon Brown this week as you know has called for a new
[1:35:52.520 --> 1:35:57.040]  world order under the Tobin tax and that they're just gonna have regional cashless
[1:35:57.040 --> 1:36:03.720]  systems with the big bank reserves already going to a cashless system and
[1:36:03.720 --> 1:36:07.440]  then all the nation-state currencies will still be there but they'll be
[1:36:07.440 --> 1:36:13.120]  globally standardized yeah but what we have going for us is that their system
[1:36:13.120 --> 1:36:16.720]  can't work it's just sort of like worrying about this Soviet Union we
[1:36:16.720 --> 1:36:20.680]  worried about it for a long time and had to be and they were very powerful but
[1:36:20.680 --> 1:36:25.000]  even me says we're long time ago predicted it won't last the system
[1:36:25.000 --> 1:36:28.880]  doesn't work so what they're proposing really doesn't work it's sort of like
[1:36:28.880 --> 1:36:33.880]  what they did the IMF and our Treasury did in the 60s and early 70s we're gonna
[1:36:33.880 --> 1:36:37.800]  print money and it's gonna be worth $35 an ounce and you know guarantee that
[1:36:37.800 --> 1:36:42.360]  well the market overwhelms so we should be concerned we should fight it we
[1:36:42.360 --> 1:36:47.240]  should expose them and we should do our very best but ultimately the markets
[1:36:47.240 --> 1:36:52.720]  will rule the biggest threat is probably the political threat that how much are
[1:36:52.720 --> 1:36:56.640]  they going to crack down on us how much how far they're going to go and can we
[1:36:56.640 --> 1:37:00.280]  ever regain you know the influence on the government where their job is to
[1:37:00.280 --> 1:37:04.280]  protect us and protect our liberty rather than serving the special interest
[1:37:04.280 --> 1:37:09.360]  that to me is really the bottom line congressman the Federal Reserve as you
[1:37:09.360 --> 1:37:16.080]  know has hired the top Enron lobbyist firm to come in in the last three months
[1:37:16.080 --> 1:37:20.080]  and demonize the in the Fed protest it's come out in the Baltimore Sun the
[1:37:20.080 --> 1:37:24.880]  army is surveilling the in the Fed protest and that all protests is now
[1:37:24.880 --> 1:37:28.720]  being considered low-level terrorism they're trying to demonize us that way
[1:37:28.720 --> 1:37:32.680]  they've also told Congress as you know that oh you're not allowed under the
[1:37:32.680 --> 1:37:35.280]  Constitution to get involved with the Federal Reserve does even though it's
[1:37:35.280 --> 1:37:38.960]  in the Constitution that the Congress control the issuance of currency and
[1:37:38.960 --> 1:37:44.960]  and credit and and set the monetary policy so isn't that the ultimate big
[1:37:44.960 --> 1:37:49.720]  lie to say that this thing that didn't come along till 1913 this private
[1:37:49.720 --> 1:37:54.240]  banking consortium can tell Congress you're not allowed to be involved in
[1:37:54.240 --> 1:37:58.960]  what we do it's it's amazing how long they've gotten away with it but we're
[1:37:58.960 --> 1:38:04.000]  getting the American people informed well enough that 75% of the people now
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:07.760]  when they're polled agree with us I think it's interesting I can give you a
[1:38:07.760 --> 1:38:11.720]  little tidbit about tomorrow maybe Alan told you the same thing but you know
[1:38:11.720 --> 1:38:15.600]  we're having hearings tomorrow in 1207 and Barty Frank has fulfilled his
[1:38:15.600 --> 1:38:19.360]  promise to me and he gave me one witness and they were going to have two
[1:38:19.360 --> 1:38:24.480]  panels ordinarily the majority has two witnesses against one you know two to
[1:38:24.480 --> 1:38:29.160]  one but then they have a government panel which has to represent the the body
[1:38:29.160 --> 1:38:31.880]  that we're addressing which is the Federal Reserve they were supposed to
[1:38:31.880 --> 1:38:36.760]  have three people testifying only one has agreed to come on the second panel
[1:38:36.760 --> 1:38:40.960]  when they were going to be to an opposition to 1207 and my one pick
[1:38:40.960 --> 1:38:46.960]  those two canceled out too so they're down to one person that came to testify
[1:38:46.960 --> 1:38:54.280]  against the 1207 and I suspect it may well be that they don't want to even be
[1:38:54.280 --> 1:38:58.600]  out there you know really chopping at the bit they might work behind the scenes
[1:38:58.600 --> 1:39:02.320]  behind us but they're not interested in taking us on in a public forum they
[1:39:02.320 --> 1:39:05.720]  don't want to give any attention to it they think it may be covered by the
[1:39:05.720 --> 1:39:09.720]  news networks in Bernanke or somebody like that is there but it's too late as
[1:39:09.720 --> 1:39:13.400]  you've said many times the momentum is now beginning to shift the people are
[1:39:13.400 --> 1:39:17.440]  like why can't we audit the Fed they're realizing that the real power structure
[1:39:17.440 --> 1:39:22.120]  the real government is the private run-for-profit Federal Reserve and I
[1:39:22.120 --> 1:39:25.440]  meant to get to this issue of the hearings can you talk about what's
[1:39:25.440 --> 1:39:29.760]  going to happen tomorrow and then how you see the process unfolding in the
[1:39:29.760 --> 1:39:34.280]  months and years to come in bringing this corporate private banking
[1:39:34.280 --> 1:39:39.640]  dictatorship to heal well I think tomorrow's hearings will be pretty
[1:39:39.640 --> 1:39:43.600]  bland that would be my guess probably not much media but we'll get a
[1:39:43.600 --> 1:39:47.920]  recording of it and Tom Woods is the a good economist and historian for the
[1:39:47.920 --> 1:39:52.840]  visas to he'll be testifying for us he will have a very good statement and
[1:39:52.840 --> 1:39:57.520]  he's a very bright person and knows you know how to handle a debate like this
[1:39:57.520 --> 1:40:03.440]  Bonnie Frank will probably be not antagonistic nor derogatory toward the
[1:40:03.440 --> 1:40:08.160]  bill and he will try to publicly pacify the people who are concerned and
[1:40:08.160 --> 1:40:13.400]  worried about it but I don't think it'll be big news tomorrow but it's big news
[1:40:13.400 --> 1:40:18.040]  among our circles because we have gotten them to a point where many others who
[1:40:18.040 --> 1:40:21.520]  have tried over the many many decades and have never gotten this far just think
[1:40:21.520 --> 1:40:26.600]  you know Henry Royce right Patman and Henry Gonzalez all coming from a
[1:40:26.600 --> 1:40:29.840]  liberal populist viewpoint have always said they were chairman of the banking
[1:40:29.840 --> 1:40:34.720]  committees and they they never got this far on auditing the fed so we are
[1:40:34.720 --> 1:40:39.280]  making progress but it also might be a sign of how bad things are to wake up
[1:40:39.280 --> 1:40:42.840]  the American people to finally say hey what is this all about what about this
[1:40:42.840 --> 1:40:47.240]  fed so I think it's the crisis that we're in as well as the time has come
[1:40:47.240 --> 1:40:51.120]  around and I think our communications are so much better with radio talk shows
[1:40:51.120 --> 1:40:56.240]  like this as well as the internet this has really spread a message among people
[1:40:56.240 --> 1:40:58.800]  today I just walked out of my office I was visiting with one of my
[1:40:58.800 --> 1:41:03.520]  constituents and I had a young guy came out in his college he was from Arizona
[1:41:03.520 --> 1:41:07.360]  and his biggest issue with the Federal Reserve I think I could my constituents
[1:41:07.360 --> 1:41:12.680]  looked at it and said wow you know he was so impressive some college kid from the
[1:41:12.680 --> 1:41:17.200]  Arizona State came up and he was fascinated you know with the with the
[1:41:17.200 --> 1:41:21.880]  Federal Reserve so we are making progress is this the beginning of game
[1:41:21.880 --> 1:41:26.680]  over for the Federal Reserve because once they're identified as the true
[1:41:26.680 --> 1:41:30.360]  shadow government the financial oligarchy as long as they can operate the
[1:41:30.360 --> 1:41:35.760]  shadows and pose as a federal agency they were invincible but once the curtain
[1:41:35.760 --> 1:41:41.640]  drops on the little man who we thought was the big powerful wizard of Oz once
[1:41:41.640 --> 1:41:46.600]  the illusion is shattered which is now happening it begins the process of their
[1:41:46.600 --> 1:41:50.320]  fault I think it might be beginning but I don't think we're very far along
[1:41:50.320 --> 1:41:54.520]  because I don't think they have yet begun to fight I mean they are going to be
[1:41:54.520 --> 1:41:58.640]  tenacious look at what they're done with the lawsuits under the Freedom of
[1:41:58.640 --> 1:42:02.080]  Information Act they are resisting they're fighting it those court cases
[1:42:02.080 --> 1:42:04.920]  are going to go on for years they're going to fight this they're going to
[1:42:04.920 --> 1:42:09.440]  resist and argue about turning over records so it's not it's not going to
[1:42:09.440 --> 1:42:16.520]  be real easy I think what will happen when you have a dramatic change will be
[1:42:16.520 --> 1:42:21.040]  when the dollar quits working I just think they're going to fight us tooth
[1:42:21.040 --> 1:42:24.680]  and nail and they're going to it's going to be very very difficult they'll find
[1:42:24.680 --> 1:42:29.640]  the ways to further imprison people who demand that they use silver and gold so
[1:42:29.640 --> 1:42:34.800]  I I just think that it will be runaway inflation high interest rates where the
[1:42:34.800 --> 1:42:39.160]  American people say yeah I think we were told about this Federal Reserve and we
[1:42:39.160 --> 1:42:42.760]  need to do more and then they'll lose all credibility and besides printing the
[1:42:42.760 --> 1:42:46.440]  money won't help that much the more they print the worst it'll be right now they
[1:42:46.440 --> 1:42:50.680]  print a lot of money to try to patch the system together in some ways they
[1:42:50.680 --> 1:42:55.600]  have patched together but they dumped all the bad assets on the taxpayer you
[1:42:55.600 --> 1:43:00.760]  can't have a wealthy country by doing that that is that will that has to have
[1:43:00.760 --> 1:43:05.960]  bad results but when the dollar collapses there's nowhere else to go
[1:43:05.960 --> 1:43:15.400]  congressman I don't even pretend to know what's best to suggest you do
[1:43:15.400 --> 1:43:21.360]  tomorrow in these hearings but I know you're a very polite focused
[1:43:21.360 --> 1:43:26.520]  intelligence scholarly person I would just encourage you to call them out and
[1:43:26.520 --> 1:43:33.120]  to be as aggressive as possible because that more firmly cements you as the
[1:43:33.120 --> 1:43:36.520]  leader and I think you're the man for the job against these people and I would
[1:43:36.520 --> 1:43:39.800]  also hope that you would entertain and perhaps I would ask now what your
[1:43:39.800 --> 1:43:43.840]  opinion is of this to bring up the conflict of interest issue that you
[1:43:43.840 --> 1:43:47.840]  have this revolving door between Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase and the
[1:43:47.840 --> 1:43:53.600]  governors of the private Fed like Geithner Paulson Bernackie the campaign
[1:43:53.600 --> 1:43:58.600]  contributions to both parties of course Barack Obama getting four times the
[1:43:58.600 --> 1:44:04.280]  Goldman Sachs money almost five times that John McCain got I really think if
[1:44:04.280 --> 1:44:08.080]  you just discredit them out of the gates that's the one thing that I've
[1:44:08.080 --> 1:44:10.800]  noticed in these hearings and I've watched scores of them I know you've
[1:44:10.800 --> 1:44:15.360]  been in scores of them I watch them at night when I get home I record it hours
[1:44:15.360 --> 1:44:21.280]  of it and that's seems to be the cross or the holy water to the vampires just to
[1:44:21.280 --> 1:44:24.520]  call these people out that they're the ones that change the regulations they're
[1:44:24.520 --> 1:44:27.520]  the ones that created the derivatives they're the ones that are a revolving
[1:44:27.520 --> 1:44:33.360]  door in their robin bank but there'll be a limit to how much of that I can do
[1:44:33.360 --> 1:44:38.360]  because I'll have a five-minute opening statement in five minutes to quiz if the
[1:44:38.360 --> 1:44:43.080]  individuals but they're not sending the people that would that you could really
[1:44:43.080 --> 1:44:46.880]  hit on those questions they're sending the general counsel now he's going to be
[1:44:46.880 --> 1:44:52.120]  a legal guy he's going to explain the law and that sort of thing if they're
[1:44:52.120 --> 1:44:56.120]  going to hide behind the technicalities of law thank your suggestions are good
[1:44:56.120 --> 1:45:02.440]  we should call on them but I will have to decide tomorrow exactly how I'm going
[1:45:02.440 --> 1:45:06.320]  to hit them and what the atmosphere is like sure we don't want to let the cat
[1:45:06.320 --> 1:45:09.520]  out of the bag or let him know our plan of attack to defend the Republic but
[1:45:09.520 --> 1:45:13.120]  clearly if you say sir because obviously you're gonna be asking him questions for
[1:45:13.120 --> 1:45:17.300]  a future hearing can you go back and ask him you know how the Treasury
[1:45:17.300 --> 1:45:23.160]  Department and the Federal Reserve gives itself waivers to allow them to give
[1:45:23.160 --> 1:45:29.600]  money to institutions they own stock in well that's a it should be shocking but
[1:45:29.600 --> 1:45:33.800]  unfortunately that's about the way they run everything they're always you know
[1:45:33.800 --> 1:45:38.400]  skirting the law is so it's only the people who have to if they have any
[1:45:38.400 --> 1:45:43.160]  infraction on not obeying the illegal law or disobeying or obeying the
[1:45:43.160 --> 1:45:48.440]  Constitution then the the roof comes down on us but to them that's the you
[1:45:48.440 --> 1:45:53.680]  know just routine activities but they should be called on it and that's it's
[1:45:53.680 --> 1:45:56.400]  actually where the American people are waking up they're sick and tired of
[1:45:56.400 --> 1:46:04.040]  hearing it and the more they hear it the better congressman looking at this just
[1:46:04.040 --> 1:46:07.320]  a pep talk to the people not that they need much of one folks are seeing victory
[1:46:07.320 --> 1:46:10.440]  they're smelling blood they know that the Federal Reserve the private cartel
[1:46:10.440 --> 1:46:15.000]  isn't invincible but Congressman Grayson pointed out in the last hour you in
[1:46:15.000 --> 1:46:22.360]  1983 first introduced this audit the Fed bill and then now here we are 25 26
[1:46:22.360 --> 1:46:27.560]  years later and even though it may take a few more years to really have victory
[1:46:27.560 --> 1:46:32.400]  over these people we are now I believe in the end game here and can you speak
[1:46:32.400 --> 1:46:37.800]  to the power of perseverance and focus you literally on the front lines toiling
[1:46:37.800 --> 1:46:45.360]  to do this and then what is it like for you to actually see Jerusalem to
[1:46:45.360 --> 1:46:48.240]  actually be going into the Promised Land to now be able to look over the
[1:46:48.240 --> 1:46:52.480]  mountain and after this 10,000-mile journey you're now only a few hundred
[1:46:52.480 --> 1:46:57.800]  miles away I don't like to address that in a personal way as much as in in
[1:46:57.800 --> 1:47:03.120]  general I think if an individual wants if they want if a person wants to change
[1:47:03.120 --> 1:47:08.880]  things they have to deal in principle they have to have an ability to state
[1:47:08.880 --> 1:47:13.800]  it clearly and they have to persevere perseverance I think it's very very
[1:47:13.800 --> 1:47:17.160]  important but you have to have truth on your side and eventually you do win
[1:47:17.160 --> 1:47:22.080]  actually I did not believe we would get this far I did not believe that the
[1:47:22.080 --> 1:47:29.120]  campaign that we ran like last year would get very far so it was much more
[1:47:29.120 --> 1:47:32.520]  encouraging to me to realize that there were a lot of people I believed when I
[1:47:32.520 --> 1:47:35.560]  came to Congress matter of fact when I ran I never thought I was even coming to
[1:47:35.560 --> 1:47:40.880]  Congress when I came my role and responsibility is to try to leave a
[1:47:40.880 --> 1:47:44.560]  record to saying you know what would it be like if you had somebody that took
[1:47:44.560 --> 1:47:49.600]  the oath of office very seriously how would that person vote realizing you
[1:47:49.600 --> 1:47:54.840]  know what I was up against because I realized you and I would use the term
[1:47:54.840 --> 1:47:58.720]  we can't really run against Santa Claus that you're not going to get reelected
[1:47:58.720 --> 1:48:02.640]  I was surprised I got elected surprised I got reelected but pleasantly surprised
[1:48:02.640 --> 1:48:07.480]  to find out that this attitude of perseverance and standing for principle
[1:48:07.480 --> 1:48:14.000]  you know really can bring about you know good results so I'm pleased with it
[1:48:14.000 --> 1:48:19.240]  but it's the power the idea is more than my personal abilities quite frankly well
[1:48:19.240 --> 1:48:23.120]  sir I appreciate your humbleness I'm not here trying to lavish praise on you
[1:48:23.120 --> 1:48:29.120]  for praise sake I think as a model or an example of perseverance you are the
[1:48:29.120 --> 1:48:35.280]  standard you're the blood of courage and I want you to know that no I want you
[1:48:35.280 --> 1:48:37.880]  to know I have three children just like you have a lot of children and grandchildren
[1:48:37.880 --> 1:48:42.200]  and I care about them and I know that we're gonna be a third world hell if
[1:48:42.200 --> 1:48:46.880]  you're not successful if I'm not successful and I just really do admire
[1:48:46.880 --> 1:48:51.520]  you and I know everybody for everybody out there we want to thank you for all
[1:48:51.520 --> 1:48:56.880]  you've done well thank you very much I appreciate that and evidently our
[1:48:56.880 --> 1:48:59.880]  numbers are much bigger than any of us knows you know the story about the
[1:48:59.880 --> 1:49:04.640]  remnant nobody can count the remnant nobody knows where they are but they're
[1:49:04.640 --> 1:49:09.680]  out there and I think they're we each and every one of our looking for each
[1:49:09.680 --> 1:49:13.880]  other and it's just great to find allies I always tell people with my crowds I
[1:49:13.880 --> 1:49:18.920]  said you know I don't know what tomorrow will bring and I don't have you know I
[1:49:18.920 --> 1:49:24.080]  don't have over expectations but in the meantime we ought to have an enjoyment
[1:49:24.080 --> 1:49:28.880]  of associating with like-minded people and having these goals and ideals
[1:49:28.880 --> 1:49:33.840]  because at least we can say that we made the effort when we communicated but
[1:49:33.840 --> 1:49:38.280]  fortunately for us today we have seen some fruits of our labor I can you
[1:49:38.280 --> 1:49:44.320]  imagine fighting this battle in 1939 or sometime back then when they when the new
[1:49:44.320 --> 1:49:48.440]  deal was in and then the world empire was really starting the militarism of the
[1:49:48.440 --> 1:49:55.680]  world I would have thought back in 1938 39 in the Roosevelt era it must have been
[1:49:55.680 --> 1:50:00.120]  pretty humbling for those of those who were trying to hold these principles
[1:50:00.120 --> 1:50:04.160]  together we've only got seven minutes left with the congressman I'm gonna skip
[1:50:04.160 --> 1:50:09.040]  this break so we have time to do that it's a network break and before he leaves
[1:50:09.040 --> 1:50:11.920]  we're gonna talk about his new book in the Fed a really a manifesto a
[1:50:11.920 --> 1:50:16.640]  constitution against this abomination one arm of this larger private crime
[1:50:16.640 --> 1:50:23.960]  syndicate but congressman a what can we do briefly to fight and and help you
[1:50:23.960 --> 1:50:28.080]  and others that are leading this charge to defeat the Fed quicker in this
[1:50:28.080 --> 1:50:33.680]  battle in this war for truth a and then B what do you think their counter
[1:50:33.680 --> 1:50:38.920]  strikes are going to be the governor's association a month ago wrote a letter to
[1:50:38.920 --> 1:50:44.080]  the Pentagon in the White House saying what are you doing saying 379,000 troops
[1:50:44.080 --> 1:50:48.360]  they now want for brigade homeland through north com that's also in the
[1:50:48.360 --> 1:50:52.480]  progressive in AP they are I don't know if you've seen this suddenly we're
[1:50:52.480 --> 1:50:55.440]  getting YouTube videos from Kingman Arizona to Louisville Kentucky of
[1:50:55.440 --> 1:50:59.920]  regular National Guard and Army running checkpoint search searching people we've
[1:50:59.920 --> 1:51:04.040]  gone and interviewed them now and it appears that we're seeing a slow take
[1:51:04.040 --> 1:51:07.640]  over and former congressman from a Republican leader was in the Dallas
[1:51:07.640 --> 1:51:11.400]  morning news Dick army just giving you a quick briefing in case I'm sure you
[1:51:11.400 --> 1:51:15.800]  know about most of it saying yes he believes Obama may use the flu scare to
[1:51:15.800 --> 1:51:20.800]  kind of smoke screen passing health care gun control open borders financial
[1:51:20.800 --> 1:51:23.960]  reform giving the banks more power so can you speak to what we can do to fight
[1:51:23.960 --> 1:51:28.440]  these people and to the whole police state that's really expanding right now
[1:51:28.440 --> 1:51:32.600]  well I'm afraid positive comment on this is about dad according you know
[1:51:32.600 --> 1:51:37.280]  according to what Obama wants you know when they passed the HIPAA law HIPAA law
[1:51:37.280 --> 1:51:40.240]  was the one that said that they were going to protect your medical privacy
[1:51:40.240 --> 1:51:46.000]  in actuality it was act exactly the opposite because in that HIPAA law is
[1:51:46.000 --> 1:51:50.160]  said in case of a national emergency the government has a right to all your
[1:51:50.160 --> 1:51:56.600]  record now you talk about a scare they keep scaring and frightening people and
[1:51:56.600 --> 1:52:01.320]  they put the high executives taking these flu shots and help dangerous it is
[1:52:01.320 --> 1:52:07.440]  and on and on so I think they're almost just welcoming and waiting boy there's
[1:52:07.440 --> 1:52:11.840]  just a little bit more we can declare all this national emergency stuff but
[1:52:11.840 --> 1:52:16.240]  it's done under you know they have set the stage for doing it under medical
[1:52:16.240 --> 1:52:20.880]  control and control of diseases always you know for these wonderful things but
[1:52:20.880 --> 1:52:25.000]  unfortunately I'm afraid the American people are going to suffer the
[1:52:25.000 --> 1:52:30.600]  consequences but all we can do is expose them for what they are and hopefully
[1:52:30.600 --> 1:52:33.920]  the American people will wake up well this really hit home for me and I've
[1:52:33.920 --> 1:52:38.560]  talked to the Pittsburgh the county that Pittsburgh is in you grew up there
[1:52:38.560 --> 1:52:42.480]  what's the name of the county Allegheny the Allegheny and I talked to the police
[1:52:42.480 --> 1:52:46.040]  officer we've got his name my guys were trying to interview the military and
[1:52:46.040 --> 1:52:49.760]  trying to ask them because there's 2,500 of them there including regular Army and
[1:52:49.760 --> 1:52:52.760]  Air Force along with National Guard they said man we speak to your public
[1:52:52.760 --> 1:52:55.640]  relations officer and they said no we're not going to talk to you get out of here
[1:52:55.640 --> 1:52:59.280]  and they followed them got their license plate and they called up posing as the
[1:52:59.280 --> 1:53:02.960]  rental car company the police department did and then when they told them who
[1:53:02.960 --> 1:53:06.720]  they were the police officer switched gears and said well you're now on terror
[1:53:06.720 --> 1:53:10.800]  databases you'll never get off of it laughed at them and I and my my
[1:53:10.800 --> 1:53:14.840]  employees are freaked out these are just camera guys I've hired and I called the
[1:53:14.840 --> 1:53:18.680]  police officer and I said did you really do that and he said yeah I did that he
[1:53:18.680 --> 1:53:24.040]  thought it was funny to ruin people's lives yeah no that that's pretty bad
[1:53:24.040 --> 1:53:29.160]  that we we don't know how many is doing that but people enjoy doing that they
[1:53:29.160 --> 1:53:34.200]  they get this sense of superiority and they have this power but it's sort of
[1:53:34.200 --> 1:53:38.040]  pervasive throughout the system anybody that has this power I mean IRS agents
[1:53:38.040 --> 1:53:43.920]  love it and they just like the lord it over other people but people of true
[1:53:43.920 --> 1:53:48.280]  worth like yourself are incredibly humble I wish we could get these control
[1:53:48.280 --> 1:53:55.920]  freaks to realize how fulfilling it is to be good I hopefully we can convert
[1:53:55.920 --> 1:54:00.760]  some people I think the true satisfaction in life comes from you know
[1:54:00.760 --> 1:54:06.920]  being productive producing something of worth worthwhile and being able to take
[1:54:06.920 --> 1:54:13.000]  care of oneself but those people you know we're oriented towards saying that the
[1:54:13.000 --> 1:54:18.440]  only way that you could be moral and upright is to have a welfare state to
[1:54:18.440 --> 1:54:21.360]  make sure everybody's taken care of steal from one group and give to another
[1:54:21.360 --> 1:54:27.920]  but I I believe true satisfaction for individuals comes from work hard effort
[1:54:27.920 --> 1:54:30.640]  the satisfaction that you could take care of yourself and your family
[1:54:30.640 --> 1:54:34.560]  regardless of whether you know you're very wealthy or not wealthy but you
[1:54:34.560 --> 1:54:39.720]  maximized your abilities today we do everything to de-emphasize the use of
[1:54:39.720 --> 1:54:43.080]  our abilities to assume responsibility for ourselves well they want us
[1:54:43.080 --> 1:54:46.960]  dependent so they can control us the classic sharecropper system right two
[1:54:46.960 --> 1:54:50.160]  final questions we're gonna let you go Congressman and we admire you and we're
[1:54:50.160 --> 1:54:54.560]  praying for you in the hearings tomorrow in closing tell us about in the Fed the
[1:54:54.560 --> 1:55:00.120]  new book coming out and please give us your take on when you believe the dollar
[1:55:00.120 --> 1:55:05.720]  will die on the dollar I don't know nobody knows exactly when could come
[1:55:05.720 --> 1:55:10.480]  anytime but my guess it's going to be a couple more years yet devastating I
[1:55:10.480 --> 1:55:13.480]  really do I think that's going to be a very bad time a lot worse than what
[1:55:13.480 --> 1:55:17.760]  we've seen so far and it's going to be that's when there's more likely to be
[1:55:17.760 --> 1:55:20.560]  riots in the street because people are going to be very very angry they're
[1:55:20.560 --> 1:55:24.200]  already angry but they'll get much angrier I just hope they can direct
[1:55:24.200 --> 1:55:28.320]  their attention the right way and the Fed has been out for a week and it's
[1:55:28.320 --> 1:55:34.280]  doing pretty well the best vote for our movement is to buy a book because it's
[1:55:34.280 --> 1:55:38.920]  the political vote and on this the more books you sell and the more you show up
[1:55:38.920 --> 1:55:44.720]  on the New York Times list the better off it is and just as a set aside I do
[1:55:44.720 --> 1:55:49.160]  not take personal benefits from this this this book was donated to the Free
[1:55:49.160 --> 1:55:54.840]  Foundation so I can push the sales of this book not for personal gain but it
[1:55:54.840 --> 1:55:59.200]  is a vote it is a vote in many way if we can get it up to number one which the
[1:55:59.200 --> 1:56:03.520]  revolution was for a short period of time it will be noticed it will be
[1:56:03.520 --> 1:56:08.480]  noticed so buying one two or three books are not all that expensive will be a
[1:56:08.480 --> 1:56:12.800]  vote that sends a message to a lot of people and you're not taking personal
[1:56:12.800 --> 1:56:16.600]  gain I've read the book it's incredibly powerful it is a manifesto against
[1:56:16.600 --> 1:56:21.360]  tyranny folks get in the Fed even if you know all about it buy 20 copies give it
[1:56:21.360 --> 1:56:26.760]  to friends family neighbors you go to Amazon bookstores everywhere where are
[1:56:26.760 --> 1:56:29.120]  some other places they can link through and get it where's the best place to buy
[1:56:29.120 --> 1:56:34.280]  a congressman well I imagine the best price is probably Amazon but you know
[1:56:34.280 --> 1:56:40.480]  you can go to you know campaign for Liberty comm to and get it through there
[1:56:40.480 --> 1:56:44.600]  I'm sure it'll be available for a lot of websites but right now the quickest way
[1:56:44.600 --> 1:56:50.000]  to get it recorded is Amazon in the Fed by Congressman Ron Paul climbing up the
[1:56:50.000 --> 1:56:56.080]  top charts sir we have 30 seconds left final comment all I know is that we're
[1:56:56.080 --> 1:57:00.520]  making progress and I am very pleased I just hope we can continue this way and
[1:57:00.520 --> 1:57:07.300]  if we do our job we can we can win this but we live in very dangerous times God
[1:57:07.300 --> 1:57:11.600]  bless you sir Godspeed and say hi to Carol and the rest of the family and say
[1:57:11.600 --> 1:57:16.160]  hi to Wayne everybody for us and again now we'll see you next time very good

[2:00:12.400 --> 2:00:19.920]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[2:00:19.920 --> 2:00:32.720]  Alex Jones chairman Rocky I'm looking at the report that you handed out this
[2:00:32.720 --> 2:00:38.440]  morning and I was wondering if you could take your copy and turn to page 26
[2:00:39.920 --> 2:00:48.120]  hey there's a table in page 26 which consists of your balance sheet and one
[2:00:48.120 --> 2:00:52.760]  of the entries on the balance sheet is under assets central bank liquidity
[2:00:52.760 --> 2:01:00.560]  swaps which shows an increase from the end of 2007 from 24 billion dollars to
[2:01:00.560 --> 2:01:08.800]  553 billion dollars in change at the end of 2008 what's that those are swaps
[2:01:08.800 --> 2:01:15.720]  that were done with foreign central banks many many foreign banks are short
[2:01:15.720 --> 2:01:19.640]  dollars and to our markets looking for dollars and drive up interest rates and
[2:01:19.640 --> 2:01:24.120]  create volatility in our markets what we have done is with a number of major
[2:01:24.120 --> 2:01:27.680]  central banks like European Central Bank for example we swap our currency
[2:01:27.680 --> 2:01:32.120]  dollars for their currency euros they take the dollars lend it out to the
[2:01:32.120 --> 2:01:37.080]  banks in their in their jurisdiction that helps bring down interest rates in
[2:01:37.080 --> 2:01:40.760]  the global market for dollars and meanwhile we're not lending to those
[2:01:40.760 --> 2:01:43.720]  banks we're lending to the central bank the central bank is responsible for
[2:01:43.720 --> 2:01:49.600]  repaying us so who got the money to financial institutions in Europe and
[2:01:49.600 --> 2:01:55.760]  other countries which ones I don't know half a trillion dollars and you don't
[2:01:55.760 --> 2:01:59.600]  know who got the money the loan went to the the loans go to the central banks
[2:01:59.600 --> 2:02:04.800]  and they they then put them out there to their institutions to try to bring down
[2:02:04.800 --> 2:02:08.280]  short term interest rates and dollar markets around the world well let's
[2:02:08.280 --> 2:02:11.760]  start with which central banks got the money there are 14 of them which are
[2:02:11.760 --> 2:02:18.200]  listed in our I'm sure they're listed in here somewhere all right so who
[2:02:18.200 --> 2:02:21.520]  actually made that decision to hand out a trillion dollars that way half a
[2:02:21.520 --> 2:02:26.120]  trillion dollars who made that decision the federal market committee okay and
[2:02:26.120 --> 2:02:31.080]  was it done at one time or in a series of meetings series of meetings and under
[2:02:31.080 --> 2:02:34.880]  what legal authority we have a long-standing legal authority to do
[2:02:34.880 --> 2:02:38.800]  swaps with other central banks you have no emergency it's not an emergency
[2:02:38.800 --> 2:02:47.880]  authority of any kind anything specific about it you know the my council says
[2:02:47.880 --> 2:02:51.960]  section 14 of the general the Federal Reserve Act all right we actually looked
[2:02:51.960 --> 2:02:55.840]  at one of the arrangements and one of the arrangements is nine billion dollars
[2:02:55.840 --> 2:02:59.360]  for New Zealand that works out to three thousand dollars for every single person
[2:02:59.360 --> 2:03:03.240]  who lives in New Zealand seriously wouldn't it be better to extend the
[2:03:03.240 --> 2:03:09.600]  kind of credit to Americans rather than New Zealanders it's not costing Americans
[2:03:09.600 --> 2:03:13.080]  anything we're getting interest back and it comes back it's not at the cost of
[2:03:13.080 --> 2:03:17.480]  any American credit you are extending credit to Americans well couldn't it
[2:03:17.480 --> 2:03:22.000]  wouldn't necessarily affect the credit markets if you extend half a trillion
[2:03:22.000 --> 2:03:27.480]  dollars in credit to anybody we are lending to all US financial institutions
[2:03:27.480 --> 2:03:31.160]  in exactly the same way well look at the next page the very next page has the
[2:03:31.160 --> 2:03:35.640]  US dollar nominal exchange rate which shows a 20% increase in US dollar
[2:03:35.640 --> 2:03:39.320]  nominal exchange rate at exactly the same time that you were handing out half
[2:03:39.320 --> 2:03:47.920]  a trillion dollars to foreigners you think that's a coincidence yes all right
[2:03:47.920 --> 2:03:53.720]  well the Constitution says no money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in
[2:03:53.720 --> 2:03:59.320]  consequence of appropriations made by law do you think that's right well let's
[2:03:59.320 --> 2:04:02.200]  talk about that do you think it's consistent with the spirit of that
[2:04:02.200 --> 2:04:07.520]  provision the Constitution for a group like the FMOC to hand out a half a
[2:04:07.520 --> 2:04:13.360]  trillion dollars to foreigners without any action by this Congress Congress
[2:04:13.360 --> 2:04:19.000]  approved it in the Federal Reserve Act when was that quite a long time ago I
[2:04:19.000 --> 2:04:25.520]  don't know the exact date you reelected 1914 I believe I don't know whether
[2:04:25.520 --> 2:04:29.920]  this provision was in 1914 or not but the Federal Reserve Act was in 1913 all
[2:04:29.920 --> 2:04:33.440]  right and at that time the entire gross national price of this country is well
[2:04:33.440 --> 2:04:37.840]  under half a trillion dollars wasn't it I don't know it's safe to say that
[2:04:37.840 --> 2:04:42.320]  nobody in 1913 contemplated that your small little group of people would decide
[2:04:42.320 --> 2:04:48.480]  to hand out half a trillion dollars to foreigners this this particular
[2:04:48.480 --> 2:04:52.400]  authorities all right we're coming back live ladies and gentlemen with Dr.

[2:11:30.560 --> 2:11:34.080]  to have you here with us thanks so much alex thanks for having me on you bet
[2:11:34.080 --> 2:11:36.960]  it's good to have you here you know instead of me throwing out a bunch of
[2:11:36.960 --> 2:11:39.760]  questions about what do you think of the fair mongering what do you think of the
[2:11:39.760 --> 2:11:42.600]  adjuvants what do you think of the announcements of sports stadiums trying
[2:11:42.600 --> 2:11:48.440]  to force medical workers quietly to take it through color of law just what do you
[2:11:48.440 --> 2:11:52.160]  think is most important right now and give us a report on what you think is
[2:11:52.160 --> 2:11:57.800]  key what I think is key is to do whatever you have to do to keep yourself
[2:11:57.800 --> 2:12:01.760]  healthy and that and I've always been proponent you know Alex you and I've
[2:12:01.760 --> 2:12:05.840]  talked about this before in terms of health is from the inside out and what's
[2:12:05.840 --> 2:12:09.960]  happening externally in terms of the bug there's not a big reason to be afraid of
[2:12:09.960 --> 2:12:14.360]  that but you have to keep yourself healthy from the inside out one of the
[2:12:14.360 --> 2:12:18.840]  problems though is the is that the FDA is going to make it increasingly more
[2:12:18.840 --> 2:12:22.600]  difficult for you to keep yourself healthy they've been sending out letters
[2:12:22.600 --> 2:12:27.560]  since may of this year for any sort of vitamin and supplement company that is
[2:12:27.560 --> 2:12:30.720]  putting out supplements that says that it can protect you and boost your immune
[2:12:30.720 --> 2:12:35.480]  system against the flu and if they've mentioned the h1n1 flu virus in any of
[2:12:35.480 --> 2:12:40.760]  their products the FDA is sending them warning letters that are actually could
[2:12:40.760 --> 2:12:45.680]  potentially cause them to and threatening criminal prosecution of these
[2:12:45.680 --> 2:12:49.880]  people so it seems to me that they're trying to eliminate the competition and
[2:12:49.880 --> 2:12:53.080]  it can get harder and harder for people to stay healthy and take care of
[2:12:53.080 --> 2:12:59.000]  themselves if they do get sick there was a in the they had a final ruling that
[2:12:59.000 --> 2:13:02.840]  came out today also about colloidal silver I mean I know that or if it came
[2:13:02.840 --> 2:13:07.160]  out last week I know that a lot of the people that I get a lot of emails from
[2:13:07.160 --> 2:13:10.640]  and I'm sure you do too they ask you know why don't I talk a lot about colloidal
[2:13:10.640 --> 2:13:15.080]  silver well I've seen this coming down the road and that they that the FDA was
[2:13:15.080 --> 2:13:18.440]  going to say it's not generally recommended to space and if it's and
[2:13:18.440 --> 2:13:22.320]  that they're taking regulatory action against the product that's marketed as
[2:13:22.320 --> 2:13:28.720]  a dietary supplement unless it's labeled in a very specific way and it's
[2:13:28.720 --> 2:13:33.560]  marketed in a very specific way and that it cannot be protected by the Deshae
[2:13:33.560 --> 2:13:37.440]  Supplement Act if it does a topical gel or anything that's used on the skin
[2:13:37.440 --> 2:13:42.120]  they've had this out there for a while it's been out there since 1997 but the
[2:13:42.120 --> 2:13:47.880]  final ruling on this just came down last week on Augustus you know it's just
[2:13:47.880 --> 2:13:50.920]  just last Thursday as a matter of fact and it was listed in the Federal
[2:13:50.920 --> 2:13:55.520]  Register that they that all over-the-counter drugs products containing
[2:13:55.520 --> 2:13:59.440]  colloidal silver gradients or silver salts are used for external use are not
[2:13:59.440 --> 2:14:04.080]  generally recognized as safe and effective and are misbranded so it
[2:14:04.080 --> 2:14:08.480]  makes me nervous that it seems as though the all of the products that we in the
[2:14:08.480 --> 2:14:12.920]  natural health community have used safely for years and have seen great
[2:14:12.920 --> 2:14:16.560]  results with it whether it be vitamin supplement herbs colloidal silver it
[2:14:16.560 --> 2:14:21.120]  seems as though those those products may be taken away from us well you know I've
[2:14:21.120 --> 2:14:24.120]  got colloidal silver generator and I've got some I've bought that I need to
[2:14:24.120 --> 2:14:27.480]  remind my wife to buy a whole bunch of the better products that are out there as
[2:14:27.480 --> 2:14:32.480]  they shut down this there's this tool you're a medical doctor and I've had
[2:14:32.480 --> 2:14:36.040]  medical doctor after medical doctor after medical doctor on in many cases you
[2:14:36.040 --> 2:14:39.120]  aren't even involved in promoting it and they say no it's a very strong
[2:14:39.120 --> 2:14:43.760]  antiviral and antibacterial and in a lot of studies and I'm gonna ask you if this
[2:14:43.760 --> 2:14:47.200]  is correct it shows it's a lot better than Tama flu or other things they're
[2:14:47.200 --> 2:14:50.560]  making all this money off of but I guess they're saying as a doctor you're not
[2:14:50.560 --> 2:14:54.200]  allowed to practice medicine and say that I mean what do we know from the
[2:14:54.200 --> 2:14:57.200]  studies I mean what does colloidal silver do I mean well what they're
[2:14:57.200 --> 2:15:01.160]  saying in this FDA ruling and this really comes right off of the FDA website
[2:15:01.160 --> 2:15:05.240]  and the ruling went into effect September 16th so this is really kind of
[2:15:05.240 --> 2:15:09.400]  hot off the presses and what it says is that anything that people have seen that
[2:15:09.400 --> 2:15:14.240]  there's no information about strength quality purity and potency and there
[2:15:14.240 --> 2:15:18.600]  was a lot of people who who sent in and gave testimonials about different types
[2:15:18.600 --> 2:15:22.600]  of things and they said that it was all anecdotal evidence that nobody submitted
[2:15:22.600 --> 2:15:27.200]  anything to prove anything to any kind of a drug quality drug quality standard
[2:15:27.200 --> 2:15:30.680]  but they've known for thousands of years that silver is a strong antibiotic
[2:15:30.680 --> 2:15:34.680]  right and they're not allowing it to be grandfathered in they're clear in that
[2:15:34.680 --> 2:15:38.440]  in they are very clear in that that without evidence and I'm reading right
[2:15:38.440 --> 2:15:42.960]  from the right from the report Alex where it says without evidence that the
[2:15:42.960 --> 2:15:48.400]  composition and labeling has not changed since 1938 or 1962 the product cannot
[2:15:48.400 --> 2:15:53.800]  qualify for either grandfathered exemptions so but I mean specifically as a
[2:15:53.800 --> 2:15:58.400]  doctor oh no we use it in our practice I mean what does it do explain to people
[2:15:58.400 --> 2:16:03.800]  why micro silver kills bacteria and viruses when antibiotics only kill
[2:16:03.800 --> 2:16:07.600]  bacteria antivirals only weakened viruses and then and then it looks
[2:16:07.600 --> 2:16:11.520]  obvious to me that right as everybody's realizing this is something that the
[2:16:11.520 --> 2:16:16.440]  evidence has shown in the past has some good effects against flu and things that
[2:16:16.440 --> 2:16:19.920]  they're now saying you better not use this you better not have it and you
[2:16:19.920 --> 2:16:23.120]  better not use certain vitamins and you better not use certain herbals like
[2:16:23.120 --> 2:16:27.560]  medicinal mushrooms and things like that that boosts up your own resistance to
[2:16:27.560 --> 2:16:31.920]  external microbes back to your question I mean the way that it's understood that
[2:16:31.920 --> 2:16:35.040]  how the silver particles work is that they go in and they cause the the
[2:16:35.040 --> 2:16:39.080]  metabolism of the bug to stop working and they stop the replication of viruses
[2:16:39.080 --> 2:16:43.040]  and it lices the cell membrane of bacteria is in fungus and and I'm not a
[2:16:43.040 --> 2:16:47.920]  an expert on the physiology of that Alex and I think there might be some loopholes
[2:16:47.920 --> 2:16:52.480]  for some of the manufacturers but I have seen FDA warning letters that
[2:16:52.480 --> 2:16:57.040]  went out a while ago the people who are manufacturers of this and I guess my
[2:16:57.040 --> 2:17:01.160]  point when you asked me what did I think was important is that we've we have a
[2:17:01.160 --> 2:17:05.880]  lot of tools in the natural health community to not only get as well
[2:17:05.880 --> 2:17:09.760]  after we've been sick so that we can avoid things like Tamiflu but that we
[2:17:09.760 --> 2:17:13.440]  can build up our own resistance to build up our own internal strength and up
[2:17:13.440 --> 2:17:18.840]  against these microbes and it looks so at every turn not only is the are they
[2:17:18.840 --> 2:17:22.080]  promoting this vaccine and everybody has to be vaccinated and I know you've
[2:17:22.080 --> 2:17:25.840]  talked about this a lot and a lot of the writings in the radio I've been on to
[2:17:25.840 --> 2:17:29.880]  have been a lot about the vaccine but it's like what else can we do to keep
[2:17:29.880 --> 2:17:34.000]  ourselves healthy it's concerning to me that it looks like a lot of these tools
[2:17:34.000 --> 2:17:42.320]  are being shut down by the FDA and FDA also well it's outrageous I mean I I've
[2:17:42.320 --> 2:17:47.520]  read the reports we've had medical doctor for medical doctor on and there I
[2:17:47.520 --> 2:17:53.080]  have gone back and seen studies over the last hundred years about tiny silver
[2:17:53.080 --> 2:17:59.560]  particles just shredding viruses and bacteria it's like holy water to a
[2:17:59.560 --> 2:18:07.640]  vampire and I mean I've got it for my family and I've seen the studies that
[2:18:07.640 --> 2:18:11.200]  elderberry might be bad because it could actually cause a hemorrhagic immune
[2:18:11.200 --> 2:18:15.120]  response and jack up your immune system and trigger something I don't understand
[2:18:15.120 --> 2:18:19.200]  all the properties of that so we're not going to use that I mean and then I guess
[2:18:19.200 --> 2:18:22.200]  in America they could come after you I'm not even allowed to ask you a medical
[2:18:22.200 --> 2:18:28.360]  doctor I mean I guess get son because I've had vitamin D helps especially the
[2:18:28.360 --> 2:18:32.400]  type that the skin produces I guess I'm not allowed to ask you if that's good I
[2:18:32.400 --> 2:18:35.080]  guess I'm not allowed to ask you if getting a lot of sleep is good and being
[2:18:35.080 --> 2:18:40.480]  healthy I guess I'm not allow I mean what are you doing for yourself well
[2:18:40.480 --> 2:18:45.760]  we're doing things like like alcohol and water and lots of vitamin C lots of
[2:18:45.760 --> 2:18:51.880]  vitamin D vitamin A trying to get fresh you know all the things that I talk
[2:18:51.880 --> 2:18:57.320]  about exercise leave fresh air fresh water good food try to eat it organic as
[2:18:57.320 --> 2:19:01.240]  much as we can try to get some little bit of exercise get out of the chair and
[2:19:01.240 --> 2:19:06.080]  away from the computer and do some exercise and I think that that's what's
[2:19:06.080 --> 2:19:09.920]  really really important and the other thing is a lot of you know our emotions
[2:19:09.920 --> 2:19:14.440]  play a big role on what happens to our bodies also and if you live in that state
[2:19:14.440 --> 2:19:18.160]  of fear that big fear factor that what that does is it presses your cortisol
[2:19:18.160 --> 2:19:21.520]  levels and it makes you or it increases your cortisol levels and makes you more
[2:19:21.520 --> 2:19:26.320]  susceptible to illness and disease so my husband and I we just don't live in a
[2:19:26.320 --> 2:19:29.960]  fear-based place about all this stuff we sort of look at it and say I'm not
[2:19:29.960 --> 2:19:33.040]  going to get the vaccine I'm not going to do it and whatever happens it's going
[2:19:33.040 --> 2:19:36.400]  to happen and if I have to self-quarantine and pull up in my house with
[2:19:36.400 --> 2:19:40.160]  food vitamins and water that's what I'm going to do while you can still get
[2:19:40.160 --> 2:19:46.320]  vitamins you'll get it Dr. Sherry Tenpenny stay there I want to get into the
[2:19:46.320 --> 2:19:49.640]  fact that Dr. Monteef has a flu report from the CDC saying it's going to peak

[2:19:53.560 --> 2:19:58.920]  to get into adverse reactions in Europe from the vaccine and other vaccines the

[2:24:20.240 --> 2:24:24.720]  announcements trying to force police firefighters military medical workers to
[2:24:24.720 --> 2:24:28.720]  take the shots threatening to fire them but also just the vaccine
[2:24:28.720 --> 2:24:35.080]  manufacturing process the adjuvants the fact that dr. Montee medical doctor was
[2:24:35.080 --> 2:24:40.720]  on with us yesterday that and he talked in detail and we went to the CDC's own
[2:24:40.720 --> 2:24:44.760]  website they admitted that upwards of 37% of people they've tested in the US and
[2:24:44.760 --> 2:24:50.000]  also in Australia have been found to have the H1N1 and didn't even get
[2:24:50.000 --> 2:24:57.360]  sick from it and it appears to be very mild and this whole thing we know they've
[2:24:57.360 --> 2:25:01.400]  been secretly preparing for it since January give us your take on that. Well
[2:25:01.400 --> 2:25:04.400]  it's not that much different than what was happening with the birds flew with
[2:25:04.400 --> 2:25:09.240]  H5N1 Alex three years ago and that they were saying that there were tens of
[2:25:09.240 --> 2:25:12.800]  thousand more people in Southeast Asia and China and around and in that part of
[2:25:12.800 --> 2:25:16.760]  the world that had been infected and weren't even sick enough to go to the
[2:25:16.760 --> 2:25:20.400]  doctor and yet the ones that were the most sick in the in the hospital and
[2:25:20.400 --> 2:25:24.560]  perhaps had a fatal or a bad outcome that those were the ones that they were
[2:25:24.560 --> 2:25:28.320]  using only for those for the statistics so that if they had admitted a hundred
[2:25:28.320 --> 2:25:33.360]  people to the hospital and 50 people died they call it a 50% death rate but
[2:25:33.360 --> 2:25:37.800]  the truth is that the 100 people went to the hospital and they were 10 or 20
[2:25:37.800 --> 2:25:42.280]  thousand people who were sick enough to not even who weren't even sick enough to
[2:25:42.280 --> 2:25:45.840]  go to the doctor that changes the denominator and makes the death rate
[2:25:45.840 --> 2:25:49.880]  you know some infinitesimally small number and I don't think it's any
[2:25:49.880 --> 2:25:53.360]  different now with the swine flu I mean they've said that they thought that by
[2:25:53.360 --> 2:25:57.520]  flu season this year almost a third of the general population in the US would
[2:25:57.520 --> 2:26:02.760]  have either been exposed or would have been sick by the H1N1 virus so what is
[2:26:02.760 --> 2:26:07.760]  the big deal they say it's highly infective but it has a low virulence
[2:26:07.760 --> 2:26:11.280]  which means a lot of people can get it a lot of people can spread it around but
[2:26:11.280 --> 2:26:20.000]  not very many people get sick from it continue breaking that down in terms of
[2:26:20.000 --> 2:26:26.320]  what do you mean what youth why are they hyping it then if it's no big deal they
[2:26:26.320 --> 2:26:30.000]  really want us to get this vaccine for one reason or another and one of the
[2:26:30.000 --> 2:26:35.520]  things that I've said for a while is that this is either phase three this is
[2:26:35.520 --> 2:26:38.600]  like when you're in the Navy and you have to do all of these final checks
[2:26:38.600 --> 2:26:42.480]  before you send the show you want to ship out to the to the ocean this is
[2:26:42.480 --> 2:26:47.240]  either the final test to make sure that all of the implementation things are in
[2:26:47.240 --> 2:26:52.200]  place before they pull the big trigger in the final one because it's looking
[2:26:52.200 --> 2:26:56.480]  less and less like this is going to be it you know we've had three trial runs
[2:26:56.480 --> 2:27:02.160]  we've had SARS we've had H5N1 and now we've had this one the H1N1 they're
[2:27:02.160 --> 2:27:05.680]  talking about it is it going to ramp up this winter and wouldn't it be a
[2:27:05.680 --> 2:27:09.820]  coincidence if it ramps up right around October 15th when the when the vaccine
[2:27:09.820 --> 2:27:14.200]  was supposed to be delivered and you know they've got these emergency
[2:27:14.200 --> 2:27:19.040]  utilization authorizations that are sitting back in the backdrop the EUA's
[2:27:19.040 --> 2:27:24.600]  which have been put into place by the 2006 PREP Act so that at any given time
[2:27:24.600 --> 2:27:28.400]  the head of Department of Health and Human Services can just say oh we
[2:27:28.400 --> 2:27:32.120]  really need this vaccine we don't have enough vaccine we have it manufactured
[2:27:32.120 --> 2:27:36.120]  enough of it let's pull in all the vaccine we can from everywhere oh isn't
[2:27:36.120 --> 2:27:40.440]  it interesting the ones we have the most of came from China and from and from
[2:27:40.440 --> 2:27:44.840]  Europe and they're the ones that have the squalene in the ASO 3 and the MS-59
[2:27:44.840 --> 2:27:48.080]  let me stop it I want to go through that but you're saying pull the trigger on
[2:27:48.080 --> 2:27:52.040]  the big event all these little events drive runs to set up the medical
[2:27:52.040 --> 2:27:57.280]  tyranny infrastructure Ron Paul talked about that last hour are you saying they
[2:27:57.280 --> 2:28:02.440]  may release something else or try to do a forced inoculation what is the big
[2:28:02.440 --> 2:28:08.320]  event well either that there is a the virus gets suddenly worse either
[2:28:08.320 --> 2:28:13.560]  something is released it seems so weird Alex that that if something was really
[2:28:13.560 --> 2:28:16.760]  made in nature which they're trying to make us believe would suddenly have a
[2:28:16.760 --> 2:28:20.240]  ramp up and particularly since everything coming out of South America in
[2:28:20.240 --> 2:28:24.560]  the southern hemisphere says that it didn't ramp up at all down there so could
[2:28:24.560 --> 2:28:30.360]  it be that they're going to have another test tube made a virus that could be
[2:28:30.360 --> 2:28:34.680]  released at some major event in the winter you know we've got the winter
[2:28:34.680 --> 2:28:38.120]  Olympics that are coming up this winter and it makes me nervous to think that
[2:28:38.120 --> 2:28:41.320]  there'll be people that will going to be going to Vancouver from all over the
[2:28:41.320 --> 2:28:46.000]  world and in the middle of the winter time and is that a point in time where
[2:28:46.000 --> 2:28:50.400]  the virus may be contracted be worse to be spread by just humans going back
[2:28:50.400 --> 2:28:53.920]  home doctor we're about to break but I want to spend time on this in the next
[2:28:53.920 --> 2:28:58.120]  segment I want to flesh this out because this is what every other medical
[2:28:58.120 --> 2:29:03.240]  doctor I have on says they believe is being set up and my dad called me
[2:29:03.240 --> 2:29:07.880]  Sunday night and said check your email and I didn't see it and I need to call
[2:29:07.880 --> 2:29:12.720]  him and find out what he was talking about he said he got a CDC report he was
[2:29:12.720 --> 2:29:16.960]  reading online that said oh we believe it could mutate and then they gave the
[2:29:16.960 --> 2:29:22.120]  mutation into something super hype hyper deadly in the next few months and
[2:29:22.120 --> 2:29:26.240]  they gave the calculation are you aware of what he was talking about I've read
[2:29:26.240 --> 2:29:29.920]  a little bit of that but I haven't perhaps read as much specific as what
[2:29:29.920 --> 2:29:33.400]  you have but that's exactly what you're saying because we see this massive

[2:33:26.680 --> 2:33:30.760]  Dr. Sherry Tenpenny is our guest
[2:33:31.560 --> 2:33:37.480]  Dr. continuing along the line that you've gotten into about all the evidence
[2:33:37.480 --> 2:33:42.240]  showing pointing towards them releasing something more deadly or knowing it's
[2:33:42.240 --> 2:33:47.720]  going to mutate the CDC report saying it may mutate into something extremely
[2:33:47.720 --> 2:33:53.080]  deadly continue. I read a report I think it was a couple of days ago and I just
[2:33:53.080 --> 2:33:56.920]  skimmed it I didn't really read at the at the details of it but it was talking
[2:33:56.920 --> 2:34:01.920]  about the H1N1 morphing into something and being a different subtype and I
[2:34:01.920 --> 2:34:04.360]  thought well that isn't that just interesting we've just spent ten
[2:34:04.360 --> 2:34:08.240]  billion dollars manufacturing a vaccine by five different companies and
[2:34:08.240 --> 2:34:13.280]  bottling it all up and even their stuff isn't going to work you know if this is
[2:34:13.280 --> 2:34:17.000]  really true that the virus is going to going to morph and they claim that in
[2:34:17.000 --> 2:34:21.040]  order for the vaccine to work it needs to be an exact batch except of course
[2:34:21.040 --> 2:34:24.680]  Nancy Cox who once in a while has said and I talked about it in my book Fowler
[2:34:24.680 --> 2:34:29.440]  she said well you know sometimes if it's a close match it'll it'll be okay so how
[2:34:29.440 --> 2:34:33.600]  close is close enough you know is the vaccine going to be even in their own
[2:34:33.600 --> 2:34:38.320]  mind is it going to be good enough to to protect against this morphed very much
[2:34:38.320 --> 2:34:42.200]  stronger more virulent virus because at that point it won't match the virus in
[2:34:42.200 --> 2:34:48.840]  the vaccine anyway. What about for the last month all these nursing
[2:34:48.840 --> 2:34:52.200]  associations and nurses and their husbands and wives have been calling me
[2:34:52.200 --> 2:34:58.040]  sending me letters now we posted on info wars.com and prisonplanet.com where
[2:34:58.040 --> 2:35:02.520]  they're told three different things in different letters you take the shot or
[2:35:02.520 --> 2:35:07.120]  you're fired you take the shot or you wear a mask for six months or you're
[2:35:07.120 --> 2:35:14.640]  fired or we'd like you to take the shot but but it's all three and then now at
[2:35:14.640 --> 2:35:17.640]  schools they're not even asking they're just telling parents you've got to do it
[2:35:17.640 --> 2:35:21.160]  they're now making the nurses take the regular seasonal flu shot this is
[2:35:21.160 --> 2:35:25.480]  confirmed now come out mainstream news weeks after we covered it and Obama
[2:35:25.480 --> 2:35:30.000]  does this military tactic of denying so everybody kind of stands down so our
[2:35:30.000 --> 2:35:34.560]  so our opposition can't articulate what's happening and build to resist the
[2:35:34.560 --> 2:35:37.480]  polls show the majority of people don't want to be forced to take it and don't
[2:35:37.480 --> 2:35:43.880]  want to take it but there's this whole kind of quiet under the radar program and
[2:35:43.880 --> 2:35:47.440]  I've talked to nurse after nurse and firefighter or firefighter they tell
[2:35:47.440 --> 2:35:51.400]  them you got to take this many have already been forced to take it at Seton
[2:35:51.400 --> 2:35:55.580]  hospitals here in Austin and don't tell anybody we made you do this or you're
[2:35:55.580 --> 2:36:01.440]  fired I mean it's like a huge curtain of tyranny and oppression is lowering
[2:36:01.440 --> 2:36:06.520]  over us. I certainly hope that a lot of those people that heard that will be
[2:36:06.520 --> 2:36:10.160]  brave enough to maybe partner with several other people who were told the
[2:36:10.160 --> 2:36:14.720]  same things and come forward and expose that because now we're talking about
[2:36:14.720 --> 2:36:19.320]  American against American and neighbor against neighbor and even friend
[2:36:19.320 --> 2:36:24.440]  against friend doing these sorts of things this really is tyrannical those
[2:36:24.440 --> 2:36:28.560]  sorts of things and people have got to be brave enough to be able to stand up
[2:36:28.560 --> 2:36:32.720]  and step out and say and expose the people that are saying this and that
[2:36:32.720 --> 2:36:36.680]  they can expose the person who told them to say that because then finally we'll
[2:36:36.680 --> 2:36:40.440]  go far enough down into the raffle we'll find the rat if we're giving these
[2:36:40.440 --> 2:36:44.640]  sort of orders and making this be that we have to take this medication and have
[2:36:44.640 --> 2:36:49.880]  one American have to be forcing forcibly giving it to another. I have
[2:36:49.880 --> 2:36:53.320]  studied the Rockefellers deeply and I know you have as well but so is Dr.
[2:36:53.320 --> 2:36:58.480]  Blalock and every researcher we have on has the same intel because we're just
[2:36:58.480 --> 2:37:02.720]  researching our own statements that the big private corporation that manages
[2:37:02.720 --> 2:37:07.640]  New York City that the Rockefellers set up tied into 9-11 tied into the big
[2:37:07.640 --> 2:37:12.120]  vaccine makers tied into all the key players and I read horror what's his
[2:37:12.120 --> 2:37:16.080]  affidavit remember he predicted the anthrax attacks before they happened and
[2:37:16.080 --> 2:37:20.240]  then with precision said who did it now so you know sometimes you take I take
[2:37:20.240 --> 2:37:24.640]  what he does is kind of whoa that's that's extreme but then he's proven
[2:37:24.640 --> 2:37:28.200]  right down the road so I've got a look at his affidavit and then I've done my own
[2:37:28.200 --> 2:37:32.800]  research reading the affidavit where he's going to the FBI saying here are the
[2:37:32.800 --> 2:37:38.640]  criminals they did it very bold have you a read his affidavit and and what do you
[2:37:38.640 --> 2:37:42.720]  think of this whole racketeering operation that he says is going on I
[2:37:42.720 --> 2:37:49.360]  have read the his affidavit I have to say that I haven't studied it and I
[2:37:49.360 --> 2:37:52.600]  haven't really connected all the dots I do know that when I was reading through
[2:37:52.600 --> 2:37:55.760]  it it seems as though I did have questions of saying there seem to be
[2:37:55.760 --> 2:38:00.200]  some gaps in some of the connections there and that's my opinion and again I
[2:38:00.200 --> 2:38:04.200]  didn't go through and study every single one of those line item things but I do
[2:38:04.200 --> 2:38:07.840]  believe that there's enough evidence there there's enough evidence that
[2:38:07.840 --> 2:38:12.920]  somebody who is on our side of the equation on our table needs to sit up
[2:38:12.920 --> 2:38:15.640]  and take notice and follow through with some of the things that he's talking
[2:38:15.640 --> 2:38:20.480]  about I mean in any sort of a lawsuit of any kind even if it's a car accident
[2:38:20.480 --> 2:38:24.560]  there are certainly elements that have missing little missing links and some
[2:38:24.560 --> 2:38:29.360]  assumptions that can be made and I do believe that that there's there's
[2:38:29.360 --> 2:38:34.280]  things that do need to be investigated no doubt I want to open the phones up
[2:38:34.280 --> 2:38:38.960]  specifically for questions on the flu the level six pandemic declared when
[2:38:38.960 --> 2:38:41.920]  it's really not a pandemic according to medical doctors we've talked to they've
[2:38:41.920 --> 2:38:46.440]  they've they've changed the scale to call it a pandemic when it's not I'd like
[2:38:46.440 --> 2:38:53.080]  you to speak to that but I want to take calls 1-800-259-9231 but only on the
[2:38:53.080 --> 2:38:59.400]  flu and the whole martial law situation 1-800-259-9231 but but doctor
[2:38:59.400 --> 2:39:05.040]  specifically and Ron Paul agrees he said this is a medical tourney first they
[2:39:05.040 --> 2:39:09.080]  say we're taking your rights for shadowy people in turbines in Central Asia in
[2:39:09.080 --> 2:39:13.760]  Afghanistan then they go a really DHS and homeland security in North Cumber for
[2:39:13.760 --> 2:39:17.560]  the American people and yeah the Patriot Act is going to be is being used and
[2:39:17.560 --> 2:39:20.840]  non-terror related and we don't need warrants anymore to take your blood at
[2:39:20.840 --> 2:39:25.680]  checkpoints or bus in your house and you know but but but that's not even good
[2:39:25.680 --> 2:39:29.920]  enough it it's perfect to then say everybody could have the flu everybody
[2:39:29.920 --> 2:39:33.840]  could be carrying it and it's just a perfect excuse to further expand under
[2:39:33.840 --> 2:39:38.840]  you and control the takeover of nation states and under level six we are under
[2:39:38.840 --> 2:39:43.760]  you and control right now I mean do you get what I'm saying here that that flu
[2:39:43.760 --> 2:39:48.920]  is the perfect thing to create the ultimate boogeyman oh absolutely and I'm
[2:39:48.920 --> 2:39:53.560]  in total agreement Alex with everything that you just said because one thing has
[2:39:53.560 --> 2:39:58.200]  led to another and the thing that bothers me about all of this is that you
[2:39:58.200 --> 2:40:02.560]  know somebody's out there making those female camp somebody's he handling
[2:40:02.560 --> 2:40:06.960]  hammering nail into wood somebody is making those shots and giving them to
[2:40:06.960 --> 2:40:11.240]  people somebody is putting documents in place and in finding their name and who
[2:40:11.240 --> 2:40:15.680]  those somebody's are our neighbors our friends people we go to church with people
[2:40:15.680 --> 2:40:21.320]  that are in our schools our soccer teams why is it that people who are doing
[2:40:21.320 --> 2:40:26.480]  those things can't see what's happening and stop and let's all band together and
[2:40:26.480 --> 2:40:32.320]  it's really us Americans there's 300 million of us and 550 of them where we're
[2:40:32.320 --> 2:40:36.080]  we've got the resistance we've got the power of the people here we've got
[2:40:36.080 --> 2:40:42.440]  numbers but yet we have allowed that them that small set of 554 of them down in
[2:40:42.440 --> 2:40:47.160]  Washington DC to pull all this wool over our eyes I think it's really time that
[2:40:47.160 --> 2:40:51.000]  we all stand up and set aside our differences to say enough is enough just
[2:40:51.000 --> 2:40:55.280]  like that 912 March I mean I don't you know when I looked at that to me it
[2:40:55.280 --> 2:40:58.840]  really wasn't about what side of the equation you were on or what you were
[2:40:58.840 --> 2:41:02.640]  saying or where your politics happened to stand it was the fact that people were
[2:41:02.640 --> 2:41:06.440]  willing to get out of their chairs spend money go to Washington and make their
[2:41:06.440 --> 2:41:10.920]  voice be heard and I think that on a state-by-state community by community
[2:41:10.920 --> 2:41:17.480]  level this is what we need to do well you're absolutely right doctor what
[2:41:17.480 --> 2:41:22.520]  about adverse reactions from the flu trials we've had nurses calling in
[2:41:22.520 --> 2:41:25.480]  saying that when they get the shots everybody's arm basically becomes
[2:41:25.480 --> 2:41:30.440]  paralyzed we have the internal CDC report about neurological problems linked to
[2:41:30.440 --> 2:41:37.640]  previous vaccines and possibly to this one what's the intel on that now well I
[2:41:37.640 --> 2:41:41.440]  heard a report out of them it was just it was a rumored report but it was a
[2:41:41.440 --> 2:41:45.000]  report that came out of Oklahoma that said that there was a small hospital
[2:41:45.000 --> 2:41:47.560]  where the doctors all got together and said they weren't going to take it
[2:41:47.560 --> 2:41:50.000]  need they weren't in neither were the nurses and they weren't going to give it
[2:41:50.000 --> 2:41:53.720]  to anybody because they had heard that the same sort of things that out of
[2:41:53.720 --> 2:41:57.560]  these clinical trials that there was a lot of adverse reactions that were not
[2:41:57.560 --> 2:42:02.120]  being reported at all and you know that's another thing is that there's
[2:42:02.120 --> 2:42:06.320]  anybody out there that's been forced to take this by an in nurse or paramedics or
[2:42:06.320 --> 2:42:10.840]  first responders they need to be very vocal about it and let everybody else
[2:42:10.840 --> 2:42:14.720]  know the type of reactions that they had because it's not going to be reported
[2:42:14.720 --> 2:42:20.120]  by the CDC and you know with YouTube that we have now and blogs and and the
[2:42:20.120 --> 2:42:25.000]  Internet there are ways that we can make our voice be heard so I really think
[2:42:25.000 --> 2:42:27.920]  there's going to be a lot of problems with it now the CDC has already loaded
[2:42:27.920 --> 2:42:32.240]  their side of the deck on that though Alex they've already put up PowerPoint
[2:42:32.240 --> 2:42:36.760]  presentations and had other speakers who are from the CDC say yes yes yes of
[2:42:36.760 --> 2:42:40.520]  course because we're going to have so many people vaccinated at the same time
[2:42:40.520 --> 2:42:45.080]  the percentage risk of vaccination injury is going to go up so we expect
[2:42:45.080 --> 2:42:50.880]  that and that's going to be acceptable well it's not acceptable well I've got
[2:42:50.880 --> 2:42:56.720]  a report here at info wars net from Steve Watson swine flu document list
[2:42:56.720 --> 2:43:01.880]  sports arena as max vaccination center and we've always known that was the
[2:43:01.880 --> 2:43:05.760]  plan people ask where are the FEMA camps and Congress admits and the New
[2:43:05.760 --> 2:43:09.040]  York Times admits they've built certain FEMA camps six big ones across the
[2:43:09.040 --> 2:43:13.920]  country for millions of Americans but they have they admit the sports stadiums
[2:43:13.920 --> 2:43:18.160]  the local schools these are the places they can roll barbed wire in hours or
[2:43:18.160 --> 2:43:22.920]  they already have it and lock everybody down they're training the military for
[2:43:22.920 --> 2:43:25.840]  force quarantine under level six but they're saying well we're not sure if
[2:43:25.840 --> 2:43:29.680]  we're going to implement that and they're now kind of floating the trial balloon
[2:43:29.680 --> 2:43:34.440]  of oh well you don't have to take the shot but you can't fly you can't get on
[2:43:34.440 --> 2:43:39.640]  a bus you can't drive to work and you're gonna have to wear a bracelet digital
[2:43:39.640 --> 2:43:44.320]  angel the very chip company got a patent their stock went up 200 plus percent the
[2:43:44.320 --> 2:43:50.120]  other day to make it for you have to take a chip to prove you've had it that's
[2:43:50.120 --> 2:43:56.440]  AP reporting that I mean this is 1984 what we're seeing Alex it's exactly what
[2:43:56.440 --> 2:44:00.760]  I've been saying for the last six months that I really don't think that the
[2:44:00.760 --> 2:44:05.480]  government at any level whether it's state or local has quite the power in
[2:44:05.480 --> 2:44:09.760]  this big country that's spread out across everywhere to make everybody show up at
[2:44:09.760 --> 2:44:12.960]  a certain place and force them to get a vaccine but they can make it really
[2:44:12.960 --> 2:44:17.200]  really hard to refuse it and the really hard to refuse it is that list of
[2:44:17.200 --> 2:44:20.520]  things that you already said and you know you can't go to places where there's
[2:44:20.520 --> 2:44:25.160]  large congregations which could be church could be the grocery store could
[2:44:25.160 --> 2:44:29.160]  be if you have a place of employment that has more than 30 or 40 people that
[2:44:29.160 --> 2:44:32.400]  they would hire a security guard at the door and you have to either show your
[2:44:32.400 --> 2:44:37.000]  digital chip or your your card that looks like a driver's license or bracelet
[2:44:37.000 --> 2:44:42.520]  or a bracelet or anything like that and you know I'm just this doctor out here
[2:44:42.520 --> 2:44:46.880]  in Cleveland Ohio and if I can think of that and you can think of that
[2:44:46.880 --> 2:44:51.240]  certainly those who would be making those sorts of tools can be thinking of
[2:44:51.240 --> 2:44:55.800]  no they're saying that's what they're going to do and I've been saying it for
[2:44:55.800 --> 2:44:59.880]  six months but that was probably that that I was very suspicious that that was
[2:44:59.880 --> 2:45:04.080]  coming down the road so now it's just coming out into full view and the in
[2:45:04.080 --> 2:45:07.640]  the playbook is being opened up well and more and more people are hearing about
[2:45:07.640 --> 2:45:13.120]  it you're right we're a 90% urban society we have the great depression we
[2:45:13.120 --> 2:45:17.680]  were 20% urban we're totally dependent on government the highways were designed
[2:45:17.680 --> 2:45:22.320]  by the Pentagon and President Eisenhower and the Pentagon Braggs this is how they
[2:45:22.320 --> 2:45:26.600]  control our society they control the resources they control our currency they
[2:45:26.600 --> 2:45:31.200]  the UN Maury Strong the head of their program in 92 at the Rio de Janeiro
[2:45:31.200 --> 2:45:35.320]  summit we have his quotes in the new film said they were going to deindustrializes
[2:45:35.320 --> 2:45:41.280]  to make us go into their control for eugenics and this may be the big final
[2:45:41.280 --> 2:45:46.320]  giant beta test to then launch the main attack in the next two to three years or
[2:45:46.320 --> 2:45:51.320]  this could be it and I think they're gauging testing the public testing our
[2:45:51.320 --> 2:45:58.160]  response and have it in between red light and blue and and and green light
[2:45:58.160 --> 2:46:01.800]  they are they are looking and I believe in the next week or two we're going to
[2:46:01.800 --> 2:46:05.200]  make the decision and I've really learned how to guess what they're going to do
[2:46:05.200 --> 2:46:09.440]  they're making the decision whether this is the final beta test or if they're
[2:46:09.440 --> 2:46:15.120]  going to go live right now and God help us you know there was a report that came
[2:46:15.120 --> 2:46:18.400]  out from a meeting that would that happened in Washington just a couple
[2:46:18.400 --> 2:46:23.400]  weeks ago and one of the people from the autism community from safe minds wrote
[2:46:23.400 --> 2:46:26.880]  a report about what was happening at that meeting and they were talking about
[2:46:26.880 --> 2:46:32.880]  what level the the insider these these flu vaccine people who were all there
[2:46:32.880 --> 2:46:37.720]  there were only two people who were non-government and CDC employee insiders
[2:46:37.720 --> 2:46:41.760]  at this meeting and it was an invitation only meeting and Barbara Lowe Fisher and
[2:46:41.760 --> 2:46:45.120]  I'm sorry I can't remember the other woman say but she's from safe minds was at
[2:46:45.120 --> 2:46:49.240]  this meeting and she wrote a report and said that you know most people when they
[2:46:49.240 --> 2:46:52.440]  went out did those town hall meetings that the vast majority of people said
[2:46:52.440 --> 2:46:56.760]  they needed to go slow either either very slow intermediate or fast and it was
[2:46:56.760 --> 2:47:00.040]  the government officials who said we need to take this at the highest level
[2:47:00.040 --> 2:47:04.560]  we need to vaccinate everybody was 55% of them well let me confirm what you're
[2:47:04.560 --> 2:47:08.560]  saying we had Wayne Madsen who went to that big international somewhat
[2:47:08.560 --> 2:47:13.960]  government run swine flu symposium three weeks ago in DC and we got their
[2:47:13.960 --> 2:47:18.440]  internal program and the cover effect we broke that it was originally happening
[2:47:18.440 --> 2:47:23.120]  as a listener in DC sent it to us and then we covered it all and no that was
[2:47:23.120 --> 2:47:28.240]  discussed openly and then one of the government people said kick the media
[2:47:28.240 --> 2:47:32.200]  out of here turn off recording devices and the whole thing was about what will
[2:47:32.200 --> 2:47:36.880]  the public accept and now we we broke at prisonplanet.com last week an article
[2:47:36.880 --> 2:47:41.720]  that had the government document in it they're sending to business owners even
[2:47:41.720 --> 2:47:45.880]  small ones and the questionnaires they're saying will you forcibly inoculate
[2:47:45.880 --> 2:47:49.400]  your employees will you do what you're told will you go to quarantine center so
[2:47:49.400 --> 2:47:54.880]  it's confirmed the feds are testing with their antennae out in the wind to
[2:47:54.880 --> 2:47:58.360]  decide if they're going to make their move we're being studied by the
[2:47:58.360 --> 2:48:03.920]  psychological warfare system right now they're making the decision and God help
[2:48:03.920 --> 2:48:10.680]  us well Alex what's the solution here how do we mobilize people to to to make
[2:48:10.680 --> 2:48:13.240]  a decision of what they're going to do to protect their families and their
[2:48:13.240 --> 2:48:18.800]  community how do we get what's the how-to I mean there's you know we we send
[2:48:18.800 --> 2:48:22.600]  out a lot of information I mean you give information hour after hour every day I
[2:48:22.600 --> 2:48:26.880]  do a lot of radio I'm on the internet a lot I write a lot of articles and the
[2:48:26.880 --> 2:48:30.120]  bottom line is people say okay this is great I'm hearing what you're saying but
[2:48:30.120 --> 2:48:35.480]  what should I do what's my how-to well we when we can't tell you get sunshine and
[2:48:35.480 --> 2:48:38.760]  get colloidal silver we can't I mean we're telling you they're gonna set up
[2:48:38.760 --> 2:48:42.240]  checkpoints and they decided drop the hammer all I can do is try to reach as
[2:48:42.240 --> 2:48:46.240]  many people as I can and and spend up most my time is trying to fund my
[2:48:46.240 --> 2:48:52.000]  operation I mean it's not a powerlessness we know we have we're
[2:48:52.000 --> 2:48:54.840]  reaching more people than ever but it doesn't look like it's enough soon enough
[2:48:54.840 --> 2:48:59.480]  and I don't know what are the solutions doctor I mean all I can do is sit here
[2:48:59.480 --> 2:49:03.440]  and go okay bear know when we put HIV and hepatitis and all these shots and
[2:49:03.440 --> 2:49:08.600]  killed all these people MSNBC okay they nerve gas troops and project Shad okay
[2:49:08.600 --> 2:49:12.480]  they radiated foster children 4,300 of them I wouldn't trust anything this
[2:49:12.480 --> 2:49:17.920]  government does okay the White House science are rode a 1,100 page government
[2:49:17.920 --> 2:49:21.720]  textbook saying they want a poisonous and sterilizes through vaccines and water
[2:49:21.720 --> 2:49:25.960]  and the UN's declassified it in tetanus shots they sterilized Asian African
[2:49:25.960 --> 2:49:29.720]  Latin American women I mean we know they're a bunch of lunatic Nazi killers
[2:49:29.720 --> 2:49:33.160]  and they just keep killing us it's like I live in Nazi Germany and I'm going
[2:49:33.160 --> 2:49:39.040]  Hitler's bad Hitler's bad Hitler's bad and I send my guys to Pennsylvania they
[2:49:39.040 --> 2:49:43.720]  go up and ask to speak to the military liaison officer the police come and say
[2:49:43.720 --> 2:49:47.480]  they're terrorist and put them on terror list I mean I mean it's just it's just
[2:49:47.480 --> 2:49:53.160]  insanity so is there any hope I mean what do we what do we do I mean you're
[2:49:53.160 --> 2:49:57.120]  absolutely right and nobody can refute your your research or your data or
[2:49:57.120 --> 2:50:01.680]  anything that you say but it went with all politics is local and all protection
[2:50:01.680 --> 2:50:06.840]  that happens within that the confines of your own health so we have to what get
[2:50:06.840 --> 2:50:10.880]  people said to not be afraid of their neighbors to go and talk to other people

[2:54:17.920 --> 2:54:21.840]  20 openly announcing the end of the dollar in the next couple years openly
[2:54:21.840 --> 2:54:26.360]  announcing global government is so much is happening and they need this crisis
[2:54:26.360 --> 2:54:29.920]  of the flu the UN bragged a couple months ago this was great for world
[2:54:29.920 --> 2:54:34.200]  government everybody was following the World Health Organization orders is it
[2:54:34.200 --> 2:54:37.840]  a moral so I tell people let's do anything illegal but now they're making
[2:54:37.840 --> 2:54:41.960]  everything illegal that people around the country are going to Walgreens in
[2:54:41.960 --> 2:54:49.520]  spring flu shot is poison squalene mercury on the side of Walgreens I don't
[2:54:49.520 --> 2:54:53.960]  think you should do that but you probably should you know put up basic facts
[2:54:53.960 --> 2:54:58.000]  handout flyers go to Sherry 10 pennies website hand those out to people that's
[2:54:58.000 --> 2:55:02.160]  your first amendment right but if the flu shot causes gillian berets with
[2:55:02.160 --> 2:55:06.320]  anybody if it causes neurological problems if this has happened in the
[2:55:06.320 --> 2:55:12.160]  past is it more or moral to not warn people and let them die or get sick or
[2:55:12.160 --> 2:55:17.640]  is it more or moral to spray paint on the side of Walgreens dr. Sherry 10
[2:55:17.640 --> 2:55:22.440]  pennies well I don't know about immoral but it certainly could be illegal
[2:55:22.440 --> 2:55:27.240]  hope I think that there's other ways I mean I I saw your report on that and I
[2:55:27.240 --> 2:55:30.080]  saw the letters that I thought what you wrote underneath there and I agree you
[2:55:30.080 --> 2:55:34.860]  know nobody's condoning people to go out and do vandalism and do that but you
[2:55:34.860 --> 2:55:38.600]  know on the other hand you know you know good for them that they were brave
[2:55:38.600 --> 2:55:42.760]  enough to do it because I think that we've been so indoctrinated with fear
[2:55:42.760 --> 2:55:47.160]  for so long fear from so many different areas that we're afraid to stand up and
[2:55:47.160 --> 2:55:51.200]  say and in again go hand out flyers you know I keep it when I go to if you go
[2:55:51.200 --> 2:55:55.400]  to pandemic blue online dot com or you go to dr. 10 penny dot com and you
[2:55:55.400 --> 2:55:59.480]  download the flyers that says the truth about the flu shot there's another one
[2:55:59.480 --> 2:56:02.760]  on pandemic flu online that's about the raggedy and doll and it tells you the
[2:56:02.760 --> 2:56:06.960]  whole history of what the mandatory vaccination is about I keep a stack of
[2:56:06.960 --> 2:56:12.280]  those in the back of my car and when I go into restaurants or I go into places
[2:56:12.280 --> 2:56:15.880]  like Macy's or others or Walmart or any place like that I just take a handful of
[2:56:15.880 --> 2:56:18.680]  them and I just walk down the aisle and I just say here's something you might
[2:56:18.680 --> 2:56:22.160]  want to look at I don't engage in conversation I don't want to debate and
[2:56:22.160 --> 2:56:25.360]  I don't really much care if they just throw them in the trash but you never
[2:56:25.360 --> 2:56:30.400]  know where those might go that person may take those and make 500 copies and
[2:56:30.400 --> 2:56:33.720]  hand them out to everybody and I think what you're saying is resistance is
[2:56:33.720 --> 2:56:38.040]  victory you have the truth you resist banner hangs on highways

[2:59:03.240 --> 2:59:06.600]  backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most
[2:59:06.600 --> 2:59:11.320]  unlike gas generators a solar generator runs quietly emits no fumes and
[2:59:11.320 --> 2:59:15.000]  produces electricity for free it's like having an electric power plant running
[2:59:15.000 --> 2:59:20.120]  quietly in your own home run some pumps shortwave radios computers and even

[2:59:28.360 --> 2:59:32.800]  the power goes out you'll be ready with a solar power generator from solution
[2:59:32.800 --> 2:59:38.800]  from science go to my solar backup comm and get off the grid today that's my
[2:59:38.800 --> 2:59:52.240]  solar backup comm or call 877-327-0365 877-327-0365 don't wait call today

[3:00:43.720 --> 3:00:49.200]  question for you I was listening to your show and another show you know RBN with
[3:00:49.200 --> 3:00:53.760]  dr. Chew off and he just released some information from Bob Chapman saying that
[3:00:53.760 --> 3:00:58.640]  the there's a naval vessel somewhere off the coast it's been fully quarantined
[3:00:58.640 --> 3:01:02.040]  now because the ship's captain and petty officer and many others have died from
[3:01:02.040 --> 3:01:07.400]  swine flu injections well that's amazing we'll check that email it to
[3:01:07.400 --> 3:01:15.680]  ridersandinfowars.com but that's you know always with the 1918 1976 77 it
[3:01:15.680 --> 3:01:19.800]  always the deadly thing only happens on a base and then and then they try to
[3:01:19.800 --> 3:01:24.080]  force an oculation dr. sherry 10 penning comments on that well that would be
[3:01:24.080 --> 3:01:27.560]  pretty interesting to track that down to find out if that's true but you know I
[3:01:27.560 --> 3:01:30.720]  think they're suspecting those things Alex I'm sure you reported a couple of
[3:01:30.720 --> 3:01:35.680]  days ago when the when the Canadian government spent swine flu vaccine in
[3:01:35.680 --> 3:01:39.800]  syringes and body bags to the Indians in northern Manitoba the Indian
[3:01:39.800 --> 3:01:44.120]  reservations up there so was that the message that if you die from the flu
[3:01:44.120 --> 3:01:47.600]  here's your body bag there was that the message if you get your flu shots you're
[3:01:47.600 --> 3:01:50.880]  gonna die you're gonna die and here's your body bag yeah that was in the
[3:01:50.880 --> 3:01:57.360]  national post newspaper just off the charts bizarre and there's been body
[3:01:57.360 --> 3:02:01.600]  bag purchases the British news reports and the US news and all those plastic
[3:02:01.600 --> 3:02:05.160]  femacophans they admit were purchased by the CDC that are kept in Georgia
[3:02:05.160 --> 3:02:10.640]  Alabama, Colorado, California and Oklahoma thank you so much for that tip
[3:02:10.640 --> 3:02:15.280]  Aaron Tom in California Tom you're on the air Alex thank you for your work and
[3:02:15.280 --> 3:02:20.520]  for having me on I have some information from a professor Garth Nicholson
[3:02:20.520 --> 3:02:24.560]  has written hundreds of peer-reviewed medical journal articles yes he used to
[3:02:24.560 --> 3:02:27.560]  work at the MD Anderson facility we've had him on fact that's a good idea to
[3:02:27.560 --> 3:02:31.560]  get Nicholson on about the microplasm incognitus go ahead well some of his
[3:02:31.560 --> 3:02:35.400]  videos I posted on my MySpace pages MySpace.com
[3:02:35.400 --> 3:02:40.040]  com slant toxic reverend I'm an environmental technologist but next to
[3:02:40.040 --> 3:02:43.560]  my icon which is a red skull and bones is a little links his videos you click on
[3:02:43.560 --> 3:02:47.400]  that he has two I posted two of his videos on the dangers of vaccines and
[3:02:47.400 --> 3:02:51.280]  another one on the biological weapons experiments on the America he's a
[3:02:51.280 --> 3:02:55.520]  scientific medical doctor very prestigious right and one of the things he
[3:02:55.520 --> 3:02:59.760]  talked about was how they don't screen for these microplasmas that they're now
[3:02:59.760 --> 3:03:03.400]  are incapacitating agents non-lethal bioweapons well that's why all the
[3:03:03.400 --> 3:03:08.880]  studies in rat show vaccines are causing in rodents just incredible arthritis
[3:03:08.880 --> 3:03:14.240]  appreciate your call doctor ten penny can you comment on the RNA the viruses
[3:03:14.240 --> 3:03:19.920]  the German news reporting cancer viruses in the shots well yes I can and two
[3:03:19.920 --> 3:03:24.280]  points one is just to acknowledge what the caller said we've known for years
[3:03:24.280 --> 3:03:28.320]  that at least six percent of all vaccines and these are also childhood
[3:03:28.320 --> 3:03:32.800]  vaccines but up to six percent of vaccines have microplasma in them they're
[3:03:32.800 --> 3:03:36.600]  not screened out for that so that's not even the the swine flu and the in the
[3:03:36.600 --> 3:03:40.600]  regular flu so microplasma has been getting into the population for a long
[3:03:40.600 --> 3:03:44.960]  time and then describe people that don't know what that is it's like uh so
[3:03:44.960 --> 3:03:49.680]  microplasma is is an organism that kind of the kind of live somewhere between a
[3:03:49.680 --> 3:03:53.560]  virus and a bacteria the best way to explain it it's susceptible to
[3:03:53.560 --> 3:03:57.960]  antibiotics but it hides inside of your cells so the antibiotics aren't always
[3:03:57.960 --> 3:04:01.600]  effective and when it goes inside the cells it acts more like a virus in
[3:04:01.600 --> 3:04:06.320]  terms of replication and it's a very nasty bug and it can cause a lot of
[3:04:06.320 --> 3:04:09.200]  problems than in a lot of health problems a lot of different health
[3:04:09.200 --> 3:04:14.160]  problems and there's a whole host of different types of microplasma too just
[3:04:14.160 --> 3:04:18.080]  a big breaking news I'm gonna get Kurt Nemo and Paul Watson to post this right
[3:04:18.080 --> 3:04:22.880]  now but you can just Google it Navy ships under swine flu quarantine AP group
[3:04:22.880 --> 3:04:25.720]  of Navy ships under quarantine after several dozen sailors and Marines on
[3:04:25.720 --> 3:04:29.680]  board tested positive for swine flu so they're just fear mongering over that
[3:04:29.680 --> 3:04:33.600]  doesn't look like anybody died a health officials say at least 69 people have
[3:04:33.600 --> 3:04:37.560]  been confirmed with the virus so they make much of do about nothing but 30
[3:04:37.560 --> 3:04:40.800]  some percent of the population already has it aren't even sick and all of them
[3:04:40.800 --> 3:04:46.000]  have since recovered so nobody's dead point there everyone recover there's the
[3:04:46.000 --> 3:04:50.440]  key point nobody's dead on the USS Boxer Navy officials say they now
[3:04:50.440 --> 3:04:54.080]  quarantine an undetermined number of crew members with flu-like symptoms on
[3:04:54.080 --> 3:04:58.720]  four ships that are part of the USS Boxer amphibious ready group which

[3:11:01.520 --> 3:11:05.640]  it here then saying it was a no big deal now they're rolling out microwave guns
[3:11:05.640 --> 3:11:09.320]  we've gotten confirmed reports and I saw this in Denver but it was in a police
[3:11:09.320 --> 3:11:14.200]  area when they saw me videoing it they they brought in a garage they have
[3:11:14.200 --> 3:11:24.080]  microwave guns big big mounted on Humvees listen this is such a police state
[3:11:24.080 --> 3:11:27.400]  there that they tried to talk to the military and talk to a spokesman last
[3:11:27.400 --> 3:11:31.200]  night defense link put a press release out and they said and they said no we're
[3:11:31.200 --> 3:11:34.200]  not gonna talk to you get out of here then that then they got their license
[3:11:34.200 --> 3:11:38.560]  number had the police poses Alamo rental car people from the county there
[3:11:38.560 --> 3:11:43.160]  Allegheny County in Pennsylvania they called them and said oh we your your
[3:11:43.160 --> 3:11:47.320]  cars got no brakes bring it in and they said well we're in the coordinate G20
[3:11:47.320 --> 3:11:51.200]  were news reporters we can't get out till tomorrow and they said well that's
[3:11:51.200 --> 3:11:54.200]  fine because I'm a police officer with the Army and FBI and you've all been
[3:11:54.200 --> 3:11:58.240]  put on terror list and your life's over boy and we know you're a terrorist and
[3:11:58.240 --> 3:12:02.960]  you were sneaking around the military base and ran all lies sherry just I mean
[3:12:02.960 --> 3:12:09.280]  and that they just think of us is dirt well and here's the thing Alex is that
[3:12:09.280 --> 3:12:14.680]  you say they just think of us they are our neighbors they are people who live
[3:12:14.680 --> 3:12:20.000]  in our communities their job is working for the other side we have to get through
[3:12:20.000 --> 3:12:24.280]  to these people that wait a minute I'm your friend I'm your neighbor I'm an
[3:12:24.280 --> 3:12:28.720]  American I vote for presidents and people just like you do why are you
[3:12:28.720 --> 3:12:33.360]  doing this I mean we have is there has to be a way we have to learn from history
[3:12:33.360 --> 3:12:38.200]  that you know when Nazi people went went into when Germans started assaulting
[3:12:38.200 --> 3:12:41.520]  fellow Germans I mean all the Jews that they that they dragged away were all
[3:12:41.520 --> 3:12:46.400]  Germans and then they hurt other Germans I mean we've got to let people get
[3:12:46.400 --> 3:12:49.680]  true to them stand there and say wait a minute you're in America why are you
[3:12:49.680 --> 3:12:54.080]  doing this and I think that passive resistance handing out fires and trying
[3:12:54.080 --> 3:12:57.640]  to when you're standing there in the gap if you if it comes to that to remember
[3:12:57.640 --> 3:13:02.440]  that to remind these people that hey we're on the same team we're it should
[3:13:02.440 --> 3:13:06.320]  be us against the people that are telling you what to do not you against me
[3:13:06.320 --> 3:13:10.760]  we should we should be doing this differently why are you doing this and
[3:13:10.760 --> 3:13:15.680]  I think that we have got to start using those passive resistance tools we have
[3:13:15.680 --> 3:13:19.800]  to use all the mind games that they try to play on us and turn the tables
[3:13:19.800 --> 3:13:24.320]  around it and get people to understand that we're all Americans and that
[3:13:24.320 --> 3:13:29.240]  whoever giving those orders against Americans that's the enemy not the
[3:13:29.240 --> 3:13:33.040]  person standing in front of you and somehow somehow I don't have all the
[3:13:33.040 --> 3:13:36.280]  answers Alex but I know you don't either but we've got to come up with some
[3:13:36.280 --> 3:13:40.320]  solutions for people who may be standing in the gap of what can they do in that
[3:13:40.320 --> 3:13:45.200]  moment in terms of resistance other than violence what else can they do well I
[3:13:45.200 --> 3:13:49.280]  want to say this approximately eight minutes ago we got on the phone with
[3:13:49.280 --> 3:13:52.240]  Douglas and he said I can hear nothing they're using sound weapons they're
[3:13:52.240 --> 3:13:56.720]  telling us to disperse Mike Nelson heard the war and the troops stopping every
[3:13:56.720 --> 3:14:00.120]  30 seconds you're saying disperse disperse we've got them let's go to live
[3:14:00.120 --> 3:14:05.200]  now here they are from Pittsburgh g20 under attack wait Mike just said they
[3:14:05.200 --> 3:14:11.520]  had them put them on the system that's why we punch them up can you hear me

[3:14:21.960 --> 3:14:25.920]  blocked off and they were using the sonic weapon on us they were using it to
[3:14:25.920 --> 3:14:29.480]  broadcast and then they would ramp up the signal for a brief second to let them
[3:14:29.480 --> 3:14:32.720]  know they could you know blow some eardrums out it got pretty loud and
[3:14:32.720 --> 3:14:38.240]  people were crouching down behind using this on was this on a protester just you

[3:15:14.160 --> 3:15:17.920]  gotten I'm envious man it's pretty wild it's pretty wild right now it seems like
[3:15:17.920 --> 3:15:21.680]  everybody just spoke so when I start happening the one group the largest group
[3:15:21.680 --> 3:15:26.240]  went through an alleyway why don't you go back and film the troops with
[3:15:26.240 --> 3:15:30.920]  pleasure up there with their gun okay and now let's do it if you want it's a
[3:15:30.920 --> 3:15:34.360]  minute or two they're driving right past me right now get them on tape
[3:15:34.360 --> 3:15:39.360]  we'll see that gun they had two of them they were using them to broadcast messages
[3:15:39.360 --> 3:15:43.960]  in Spanish and English that's the engine right now you can hear it pass to me and
[3:15:43.960 --> 3:15:47.440]  there's a guy sitting on top and they would broadcast a message from the
[3:15:47.440 --> 3:15:51.440]  chief of police that we were in an unlawful uh monitoring they should
[3:15:51.440 --> 3:15:55.080]  arrest anybody doesn't matter if your press or not they didn't disperse and
[3:15:55.080 --> 3:16:00.320]  they started like launching the uh the weapon so people don't have a permitted
[3:16:00.320 --> 3:16:03.360]  march violating the first of them you don't need to have a permit what was the
[3:16:03.360 --> 3:16:07.480]  march doing when you were attacked and was it National Guard or police it was
[3:16:07.480 --> 3:16:12.920]  police everybody has police on their chest I haven't seen I do think there's
[3:16:12.920 --> 3:16:16.680]  uh there weren't dark outfits you know the Darth Vader looking outfit and then
[3:16:16.680 --> 3:16:19.760]  they have the camera but the news is reporting and you guys say you talked to
[3:16:19.760 --> 3:16:22.760]  National Guard this morning you were saying they're together and and and the
[3:16:22.760 --> 3:16:27.080]  National Guard and like the police uniform was not armed at all in terms of
[3:16:27.080 --> 3:16:30.560]  with Billy Claw's or anything but they were working with police to cordon off
[3:16:30.560 --> 3:16:35.240]  areas and they had Humvees right now I'm looking at a line of police
[3:16:35.240 --> 3:16:39.560]  uh stretched on their full ragged here to you want the police I'm seeing now
[3:16:39.560 --> 3:16:43.000]  aren't full ragged here are they the police though wearing the National Guard
[3:16:43.000 --> 3:16:48.160]  bottoms no no these are they're all one duck over there are some uh they look
[3:16:48.160 --> 3:16:52.000]  like border patrol I've seen border patrol here too they have the dark green
[3:16:52.000 --> 3:16:58.400]  border patrol uniform so federal police in the middle of a Pennsylvania again
[3:16:58.400 --> 3:17:01.480]  and Dr. Sherry tim penny I'm gonna come back to you in the next segment okay
[3:17:01.480 --> 3:17:05.720]  can you okay we'll put you on hold for five minutes okay I'm gonna shut up give
[3:17:05.720 --> 3:17:10.880]  me a complete report of what happened to you okay we're walking down Liberty
[3:17:10.880 --> 3:17:14.320]  Street and right as we're getting to 34th they had this tree blocked off and
[3:17:14.320 --> 3:17:17.200]  they were talking to us through the little sound cannon things and then they
[3:17:17.200 --> 3:17:20.720]  would trust them you know just to do a beep it'd be like beep beep beep beep beep but it
[3:17:20.720 --> 3:17:23.880]  would get really loud for a split second and they would turn it down and they'd
[3:17:23.880 --> 3:17:27.000]  bring it back up again and then turn it down just to let you know that they could
[3:17:27.000 --> 3:17:30.080]  do that you know it was it was definitely a show force and there's
[3:17:30.080 --> 3:17:35.200]  probably I'm looking at about 300 military right now and Douglas said it
[3:17:35.200 --> 3:17:43.600]  was painful was it painful it didn't get a lot to where it was painful but it
[3:17:43.600 --> 3:17:47.040]  got loud as you know they could turn it up loud they were they were throwing it
[3:17:47.040 --> 3:17:50.600]  up at us just to let us know when people started crouching down behind cars
[3:17:50.600 --> 3:17:53.280]  and mailboxes because they thought they were going to do the real thing on like
[3:17:53.280 --> 3:17:56.080]  what were they what were I think they did do the real thing on you buddy because
[3:17:56.080 --> 3:18:02.280]  what Douglas said but do always is a cheerful person do well whatever the
[3:18:02.280 --> 3:18:10.160]  point is Rob specifically what were they broadcasting in English and I have that
[3:18:10.160 --> 3:18:12.840]  on tape and basically what they're saying is that we're in an unlawful
[3:18:12.840 --> 3:18:17.120]  assembly and the chief police order to disperse and if we don't disperse you'll
[3:18:17.120 --> 3:18:21.200]  be arrested they may use a non or they say non-lethal means not only the way
[3:18:21.200 --> 3:18:26.680]  that you could be to be able to work out could be injured you know not only for
[3:18:26.680 --> 3:18:32.440]  me so they said it is is is is Burmese or do is Burmese is right next to me you
[3:18:32.440 --> 3:18:34.600]  want to talk to him
[3:18:38.600 --> 3:18:43.440]  hey I want to be clear about this they were shooting you guys with this Douglas
[3:18:43.440 --> 3:18:48.240]  was saying it was hurting what was this like the testable level was very very
[3:18:48.240 --> 3:18:52.160]  high one moment I was covering the front of the protest the next moment my
[3:18:52.160 --> 3:18:56.400]  ear drums were blasting and as that happened I basically turned around saw
[3:18:56.400 --> 3:19:01.160]  about 40 riot police assisted by military and I ran up and I got all the
[3:19:01.160 --> 3:19:05.080]  footage I could every once in a while there you go assisted by military so
[3:19:05.080 --> 3:19:09.040]  this is the military attacking the American people because in every every

[3:29:36.200 --> 3:29:38.520]  once I heard they were blocking off streets that means they're going in on
[3:29:38.520 --> 3:29:42.880]  them they don't care if people disperse it's about drawing blood first blood on
[3:29:42.880 --> 3:29:47.760]  the American people it's about attacking us these audio and microwave
[3:29:47.760 --> 3:29:51.840]  weapons are about training the police to open fire it's a simulation weapon we're
[3:29:51.840 --> 3:30:00.360]  on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[3:30:00.360 --> 3:30:04.760]  hello friends this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this
[3:30:04.760 --> 3:30:08.360]  question do you really know what's in your tap water in a recent study
[3:30:08.360 --> 3:30:13.160]  conducted by a major environmental auditor they found that over 260 chemicals
[3:30:13.160 --> 3:30:17.120]  and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water many of these chemicals are
[3:30:17.120 --> 3:30:20.720]  directly linked to cancer reproductive immune and developmental system
[3:30:20.720 --> 3:30:24.960]  diseases now what are you going to do about it the a colo blue atmospheric
[3:30:24.960 --> 3:30:28.680]  water generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your
[3:30:28.680 --> 3:30:32.760]  family's drinking water the a colo blue
[3:30:32.760 --> 3:30:46.480]  the sound weapons on Burma's that sounds like what yeah the protesters are one block over I can see them through a side alley right now
[3:30:46.480 --> 3:30:52.640]  um I'm getting a shot of it I would assume it sounds like the sound weapon is
[3:30:52.640 --> 3:31:01.880]  about maybe a block away to my right okay I want you to you oh my god can
[3:31:01.880 --> 3:31:06.040]  you get around on the street but not with the protesters and get a shot as you
[3:31:06.040 --> 3:31:10.440]  leave that's exactly what I'm doing I'm going around to cut them off at the front
[3:31:10.440 --> 3:31:15.120]  and hopefully be able to get them coming around and seeing where where the truth
[3:31:15.120 --> 3:31:19.360]  are we I've got a firefighter shooting up right next to me however I've made it
[3:31:19.360 --> 3:31:24.880]  past majority of the police officer so the riot police are probably now four
[3:31:24.880 --> 3:31:29.440]  blocks away from me yeah stay outside the cordon but then well this is up to
[3:31:29.440 --> 3:31:32.960]  you well I don't want to lose the video you've got because they'll just deny any
[3:31:32.960 --> 3:31:37.560]  of this ever even happen we looked at CNN Fox this is nowhere this is nowhere
[3:31:37.560 --> 3:31:42.800]  we know in New York in 2004 they used it we heard it from a distance by the time
[3:31:42.800 --> 3:31:51.120]  we got there was playing we heard the sound weapon is it off now
[3:31:51.120 --> 3:32:01.760]  Burma's Jason is the phone disconnected
[3:32:05.120 --> 3:32:09.080]  it's on do you hear it Burma's hold the phone up so we can hear the yellow rad
[3:32:09.080 --> 3:32:12.920]  hey yeah no I went dead for a second Alex I still was connected to you but it
[3:32:12.920 --> 3:32:16.840]  went dead for a moment hold on I'll hold the phone out but it looks like I'm another
[3:32:16.840 --> 3:32:23.120]  kid they've got a block away let's see if you can hear it yeah I've got other
[3:32:23.120 --> 3:32:26.800]  trucks now coming past me it looks like they've also got a couple of empty
[3:32:26.800 --> 3:32:30.920]  buses and right now approaching me are the protesters you're coming to the
[3:32:30.920 --> 3:32:37.400]  protesters Alex towards you right now get away from them get away stay way
[3:32:37.400 --> 3:32:40.920]  ahead you're gonna get caught up with them look getting video I'm making the
[3:32:40.920 --> 3:32:45.480]  decision get the hell out of there right now okay okay go go stop filming
[3:32:45.480 --> 3:32:48.520]  get out of there they're coming towards you they're gonna drive you down you
[3:32:48.520 --> 3:32:53.200]  cannot get caught get out of there okay all right I mean they've taken AP
[3:32:53.200 --> 3:32:57.000]  reporters recordings they've taken Pacifica reporters and arrested them and
[3:32:57.000 --> 3:33:00.280]  smashed their cameras that they will take your stuff they will break the
[3:33:00.280 --> 3:33:05.040]  cameras they are complete enemies of America I do they love it and folks if
[3:33:05.040 --> 3:33:08.040]  you don't think the military won't come after your guns if you don't think the
[3:33:08.040 --> 3:33:11.040]  military doesn't want to disarm you if you don't think they don't aren't
[3:33:11.040 --> 3:33:15.240]  spoiling for a fight with us I don't care what they say we've proven it they
[3:33:15.240 --> 3:33:19.400]  are ready look at Ken State and our military has been taken over you have
[3:33:19.400 --> 3:33:25.360]  you have G20 global leaders meeting openly in mainstream news to get rid of
[3:33:25.360 --> 3:33:30.000]  the dollar and bring in quote global governance this is the end of our country
[3:33:30.000 --> 3:33:32.960]  and the police in the military are acting like people that don't like it or
[3:33:32.960 --> 3:33:36.560]  pure scum and terrorist because the DHS has trained them to do that
[3:33:36.560 --> 3:33:41.880]  Hermes what's happening now I am backing off but a good majority of the
[3:33:41.880 --> 3:33:46.200]  protesters mostly anarchists and black and front are making it down you could
[3:33:46.200 --> 3:33:50.120]  probably hear them right now then this is probably a staged event and they're
[3:33:50.120 --> 3:33:53.840]  with the police they're probably gonna go to a normal protest and then try to
[3:33:53.840 --> 3:33:58.920]  claim that get out of there all right are you getting away from them I'm
[3:33:58.920 --> 3:34:04.560]  backing up and back up how far away are you from them I'm probably about one
[3:34:04.560 --> 3:34:12.200]  200 feet away and so the L rat is further away and and what drove them back yeah
[3:34:12.200 --> 3:34:16.840]  what they've been doing is as the police now in certain areas they'll take
[3:34:16.840 --> 3:34:19.960]  certain side streets because we're outside of the main city of Pittsburgh
[3:34:19.960 --> 3:34:24.800]  this started in Lawrence about a mile and a half away and originally in the
[3:34:24.800 --> 3:34:29.760]  park the riot police had gathered and they had they decided that the they
[3:34:29.760 --> 3:34:33.320]  would go the other direction there were no riot police set up there at first
[3:34:33.320 --> 3:34:39.400]  then the police cordoned them off the sound weapons were they then moved to
[3:34:39.400 --> 3:34:43.480]  the right hand side by the time it turned around to cover the protesters the
[3:34:43.480 --> 3:34:48.400]  majority of them were already gone this is the first time then that I've been
[3:34:48.400 --> 3:34:51.520]  around them but I can already tell but they've been able to disperse the crowd
[3:34:51.520 --> 3:34:57.840]  by at least at least three-fifths I mean if this crowd was much larger than it
[3:34:57.840 --> 3:35:03.280]  was before just to be clear just to be clear don't stay at the head of them
[3:35:03.280 --> 3:35:07.840]  go down a side street get out of there right now okay right now and they're
[3:35:07.840 --> 3:35:12.000]  passing Alex I have no police are on me at this point they have not caught up
[3:35:12.000 --> 3:35:16.000]  oh you're gonna see the police following them later they'll be hungry for blood
[3:35:16.000 --> 3:35:20.200]  and to engage their enemy the American people and so they may corner you in
[3:35:20.200 --> 3:35:24.440]  that alley or side street here come the anarchist staging here they come right
[3:35:24.440 --> 3:35:30.320]  now they are there they just grabbed a dumpster they're flipping it over I got
[3:35:30.320 --> 3:35:34.080]  it I got it on tape right now I don't want to put you in danger Jason but if
[3:35:34.080 --> 3:35:38.840]  you follow that stinking fed is it a big guy all right it was three people and
[3:35:38.840 --> 3:35:42.800]  of course they had masks on Alex I I earlier followed a couple people that I
[3:35:42.800 --> 3:35:48.600]  caught spray-painting a couple that was throwing eggs I mean I am not you know I
[3:35:48.600 --> 3:35:52.760]  am desperately trying to cover this the best that I can you are kicking butt my
[3:35:52.760 --> 3:36:01.080]  friend so so the operatives the operatives are recap so we have a
[3:36:01.080 --> 3:36:06.360]  record you didn't see military with the L. Rand police and you've talked to
[3:36:06.360 --> 3:36:12.400]  military today yes I talked to military earlier today they were at a they were
[3:36:12.400 --> 3:36:17.560]  five people outside of a Humvee basically most of the Humvees in the
[3:36:17.560 --> 3:36:21.340]  military were courting off at checkpoints on Main Street in the main
[3:36:21.340 --> 3:36:26.120]  city of Pittsburgh I approached them I asked them what their mission was they
[3:36:26.120 --> 3:36:29.760]  said it was to assist the police I asked them what they would have to state of
[3:36:29.760 --> 3:36:33.400]  their critics that this was a violation of positive comment on it and of course
[3:36:33.400 --> 3:36:36.960]  none of them knew that what that was I then had to explain to them that that
[3:36:36.960 --> 3:36:41.000]  was the separation of military and police and it was the standard boilerplate
[3:36:41.000 --> 3:36:45.920]  answer of you know we're just following orders
[3:36:45.920 --> 3:36:51.200]  unbelievable now you did see troops national guard or army with the police
[3:36:51.200 --> 3:36:57.200]  with the L. Rand cannon like I said they were in a full military I mean
[3:36:57.200 --> 3:37:02.560]  these weren't just the uh the pants they were they were the tops yesterday at
[3:37:02.560 --> 3:37:06.680]  the uh the clean air concert although they when I approached them I asked them
[3:37:06.680 --> 3:37:10.520]  whether they were military and purple they told me they were police however
[3:37:10.520 --> 3:37:15.360]  they had no police numbers no identity as police and they were wearing the
[3:37:15.360 --> 3:37:20.080]  American flag backwards in green in full military and riot gear so I think they
[3:37:20.080 --> 3:37:22.520]  were lying to me as well well of course that's what they do to their enemy the
[3:37:22.520 --> 3:37:26.680]  American people um Burmese briefly and we're gonna go to sherry tim penny
[3:37:26.680 --> 3:37:31.520]  briefly tell folks about last night you guys pull up to the gate you have to
[3:37:31.520 --> 3:37:35.640]  talk to the public information officer they called the police and lied and said
[3:37:35.640 --> 3:37:40.560]  that you were sneaking around you ran from them is that true absolutely not
[3:37:40.560 --> 3:37:45.360]  you know we went up to the main gate we asked the officer if he could discuss
[3:37:45.360 --> 3:37:48.880]  all what the 2,500 troops would be doing in Pittsburgh tomorrow he said he
[3:37:48.880 --> 3:37:52.200]  couldn't even told us that he could get a representative that could or a phone
[3:37:52.200 --> 3:37:55.880]  number we then pulled off to the side of the road where they instructed us to we
[3:37:55.880 --> 3:38:00.160]  waited around 15 or 20 minutes a representative came back immediately he
[3:38:00.160 --> 3:38:03.400]  was hostile towards us he did not like our credentials he said he would not
[3:38:03.400 --> 3:38:07.440]  answer our question yeah I heard him I was on cell phone with dude go ahead yeah
[3:38:07.440 --> 3:38:10.920]  yeah exactly and you know we tried to get much information as we could he
[3:38:10.920 --> 3:38:14.640]  refused to answer our questions so then Rob asked him for his information and
[3:38:14.640 --> 3:38:18.760]  where we could contact him tomorrow if we could get a word with him he then gave
[3:38:18.760 --> 3:38:23.240]  it and we left we didn't run away from anything by the time that we had left
[3:38:23.240 --> 3:38:27.080]  turned around and exited the main military facility there was another
[3:38:27.080 --> 3:38:32.400]  car parked on the other side of the road waited for us past follow us for an
[3:38:32.400 --> 3:38:37.440]  exit then I got off and then we were shot when Doug was got a call trying to
[3:38:37.440 --> 3:38:42.240]  entrap him and have us go return our rental car for quote-unquote two more
[3:38:42.240 --> 3:38:47.240]  free days when we didn't call for that he then came clean and said he was
[3:38:47.240 --> 3:38:50.640]  actually military personnel and he wanted to know whether or not we were
[3:38:50.640 --> 3:38:55.360]  terrorists Alan and then he told Douglas you're on a list now pal the rest of

[3:41:49.980 --> 3:41:52.980]  this is just another beta test
[3:41:52.980 --> 3:41:54.980]  and we need everybody to go to Pittsburgh

[3:42:08.980 --> 3:42:11.980]  and we need people to follow the anarchist
[3:42:11.980 --> 3:42:14.980]  and expose that they're going to go back
[3:42:14.980 --> 3:42:16.980]  they're going to get controlled by the feds
[3:42:16.980 --> 3:42:18.980]  they're going to go back to military installations
[3:42:18.980 --> 3:42:20.980]  it's happened in every case
[3:42:20.980 --> 3:42:22.980]  we proved it in Denver, we proved it in Ottawa
[3:42:22.980 --> 3:42:24.980]  we proved it in Seattle, we proved it in London
[3:42:24.980 --> 3:42:26.980]  we proved it in Genoa, we proved it every time
[3:42:26.980 --> 3:42:28.980]  Burma's what's happening now
[3:42:28.980 --> 3:42:30.980]  well I'm down the street
[3:42:30.980 --> 3:42:33.980]  I can see the street where the main protestors are going
[3:42:33.980 --> 3:42:36.980]  they're going in the opposite direction it looks like
[3:42:36.980 --> 3:42:38.980]  I hung a left, they're hanging a right
[3:42:38.980 --> 3:42:40.980]  let's see what the cops do is
[3:42:40.980 --> 3:42:42.980]  they make the protestors think they're in control
[3:42:42.980 --> 3:42:44.980]  in certain streets
[3:42:44.980 --> 3:42:46.980]  and they will herd them to a dead end
[3:42:46.980 --> 3:42:48.980]  where all the cops are waiting
[3:42:48.980 --> 3:42:50.980]  with tear gas and rubber bullets
[3:42:50.980 --> 3:42:52.980]  and I got video and they'll walk up to an old lady
[3:42:52.980 --> 3:42:54.980]  and with every bit of force with a club
[3:42:54.980 --> 3:42:56.980]  go just with death blow power
[3:42:56.980 --> 3:42:58.980]  and break their collar bone
[3:42:58.980 --> 3:43:00.980]  I mean that's in police state to the takeover
[3:43:00.980 --> 3:43:02.980]  and the cops will high five
[3:43:02.980 --> 3:43:04.980]  the troops will high five
[3:43:04.980 --> 3:43:06.980]  nothing like American blood
[3:43:06.980 --> 3:43:08.980]  they just hate America
[3:43:08.980 --> 3:43:10.980]  I mean this is what they're doing
[3:43:10.980 --> 3:43:12.980]  and so get the hell out of there
[3:43:12.980 --> 3:43:14.980]  that we need just thousands of people to go to Pittsburgh
[3:43:14.980 --> 3:43:16.980]  to peacefully expose these people
[3:43:16.980 --> 3:43:18.980]  but again they'll let the anarchists go
[3:43:18.980 --> 3:43:20.980]  they'll pick out a few old ladies
[3:43:20.980 --> 3:43:22.980]  they love weak people like wolves
[3:43:22.980 --> 3:43:24.980]  wolves love weak animals
[3:43:24.980 --> 3:43:26.980]  and they will just I mean
[3:43:26.980 --> 3:43:28.980]  I got video in police state to the takeover
[3:43:28.980 --> 3:43:30.980]  you've seen it Burma's with that old lady
[3:43:30.980 --> 3:43:32.980]  just in a neighborhood and the police come up
[3:43:32.980 --> 3:43:34.980]  and start stomping her
[3:43:34.980 --> 3:43:36.980]  with the military excuse me
[3:43:36.980 --> 3:43:38.980]  with full power
[3:43:38.980 --> 3:43:40.980]  they'll take city council
[3:43:40.980 --> 3:43:42.980]  with all these broken bones the next week
[3:43:42.980 --> 3:43:44.980]  they just they hate America
[3:43:44.980 --> 3:43:46.980]  they are just demonic entities
[3:43:46.980 --> 3:43:48.980]  I just can't believe how scum filled they are
[3:43:48.980 --> 3:43:50.980]  Burma City anything else
[3:43:50.980 --> 3:43:52.980]  well they're armed to the teeth
[3:43:52.980 --> 3:43:54.980]  I mean these guys have shotguns
[3:43:54.980 --> 3:43:56.980]  they look like like I said
[3:43:56.980 --> 3:43:58.980]  wow I was talking to you initially
[3:43:58.980 --> 3:44:00.980]  they all put on the tear gas mask
[3:44:00.980 --> 3:44:02.980]  I got out of that vicinity I don't know if they let any of those off
[3:44:02.980 --> 3:44:04.980]  but I mean these guys are in full garb
[3:44:04.980 --> 3:44:06.980]  I got some really great shots
[3:44:06.980 --> 3:44:08.980]  they will put us in dirt pits and shoot us
[3:44:08.980 --> 3:44:10.980]  we've seen this in every other country
[3:44:10.980 --> 3:44:12.980]  they are training them on blood
[3:44:12.980 --> 3:44:14.980]  training them to attack us
[3:44:14.980 --> 3:44:16.980]  they're like attack dogs being trained
[3:44:16.980 --> 3:44:18.980]  on baby kittens how to kill them
[3:44:18.980 --> 3:44:20.980]  that's all that's happening is death training
[3:44:22.980 --> 3:44:24.980]  I can't disagree Alex
[3:44:24.980 --> 3:44:26.980]  it's pretty wild man
[3:44:26.980 --> 3:44:28.980]  you've seen the videos of the troops and contractors
[3:44:28.980 --> 3:44:30.980]  shooting families in their cars
[3:44:30.980 --> 3:44:32.980]  driving down Baghdad highways and laughing
[3:44:32.980 --> 3:44:34.980]  children being filled full of holes
[3:44:34.980 --> 3:44:36.980]  it's just a celebration of love
[3:44:36.980 --> 3:44:38.980]  it's just that they're into
[3:44:38.980 --> 3:44:40.980]  how they murder innocents
[3:44:40.980 --> 3:44:42.980]  these people are pure evil
[3:44:44.980 --> 3:44:46.980]  I'm sorry I'm so out of breath

[3:44:52.980 --> 3:44:54.980]  she just walked down here
[3:44:54.980 --> 3:44:56.980]  I'm on a calm street there's nobody around me
[3:44:56.980 --> 3:44:58.980]  let me say how to Cindy Sheehan
[3:44:58.980 --> 3:45:00.980]  put Cindy Sheehan on

[3:45:06.980 --> 3:45:08.980]  and police this is like
[3:45:08.980 --> 3:45:10.980]  this is like Kent State with sound weapons
[3:45:10.980 --> 3:45:12.980]  this is huge news and it's
[3:45:12.980 --> 3:45:14.980]  nowhere on TV Cindy tell us what happened
[3:45:14.980 --> 3:45:16.980]  well you know we've
[3:45:16.980 --> 3:45:18.980]  just been trying to get
[3:45:18.980 --> 3:45:20.980]  lawfully assembled and peaceably
[3:45:20.980 --> 3:45:22.980]  marched but we were just in a place
[3:45:22.980 --> 3:45:24.980]  where there was like 600 cops in full
[3:45:24.980 --> 3:45:26.980]  riot gear and they are
[3:45:26.980 --> 3:45:28.980]  and they do have the sound weapons
[3:45:28.980 --> 3:45:30.980]  and they do have the microwave weapons
[3:45:30.980 --> 3:45:32.980]  so
[3:45:32.980 --> 3:45:34.980]  oh wait you saw the microwave gun
[3:45:34.980 --> 3:45:36.980]  oh heck yeah
[3:45:36.980 --> 3:45:38.980]  oh my god those things can kill you
[3:45:38.980 --> 3:45:40.980]  on high beam
[3:45:40.980 --> 3:45:42.980]  and we were really close too
[3:45:42.980 --> 3:45:44.980]  yeah this is America Alex
[3:45:44.980 --> 3:45:46.980]  this is a country my son died for
[3:45:48.980 --> 3:45:50.980]  where you can't even exercise your first amendment right
[3:45:50.980 --> 3:45:52.980]  Cindy Sheehan give us a quick report
[3:45:52.980 --> 3:45:54.980]  what have you seen with the LRAD and the microwave guns
[3:45:56.980 --> 3:45:58.980]  well they have them and that's how
[3:45:58.980 --> 3:46:00.980]  they're using that I don't think that
[3:46:00.980 --> 3:46:02.980]  they've turned them on or they haven't turned them on
[3:46:02.980 --> 3:46:04.980]  where I've been but there is LRAD here
[3:46:04.980 --> 3:46:06.980]  and they're warning us they turned them on
[3:46:06.980 --> 3:46:08.980]  they've turned them on oh my gosh we've heard it
[3:46:08.980 --> 3:46:10.980]  they see I wasn't where they
[3:46:10.980 --> 3:46:12.980]  we're just trying to get
[3:46:12.980 --> 3:46:14.980]  to downtown so we can exercise
[3:46:14.980 --> 3:46:16.980]  our freedom of speech
[3:46:16.980 --> 3:46:18.980]  Alex and you know they're blocking
[3:46:18.980 --> 3:46:20.980]  peaceful protesters
[3:46:20.980 --> 3:46:22.980]  we don't have any weapons
[3:46:22.980 --> 3:46:24.980]  they're blocking us with the most
[3:46:24.980 --> 3:46:26.980]  disastrous
[3:46:26.980 --> 3:46:28.980]  horrible weapons
[3:46:28.980 --> 3:46:30.980]  that they can think of and so yeah
[3:46:30.980 --> 3:46:32.980]  it's just really
[3:46:32.980 --> 3:46:34.980]  awful down here
[3:46:34.980 --> 3:46:36.980]  and they've also
[3:46:36.980 --> 3:46:38.980]  learned how to get around
[3:46:38.980 --> 3:46:40.980]  vinegar if you soak
[3:46:40.980 --> 3:46:42.980]  your bandana and vinegar
[3:46:42.980 --> 3:46:44.980]  it's supposed to stop the tear gas
[3:46:44.980 --> 3:46:46.980]  but they've put
[3:46:46.980 --> 3:46:48.980]  baking soda in their tear gas
[3:46:48.980 --> 3:46:50.980]  so it'll make the bandana
[3:46:50.980 --> 3:46:52.980]  even more dangerous
[3:46:52.980 --> 3:46:54.980]  this is just incredible
[3:46:54.980 --> 3:46:56.980]  and here you are
[3:46:56.980 --> 3:46:58.980]  constantly fighting and Martha's
[3:46:58.980 --> 3:47:00.980]  vineyard in Crawford, Texas
[3:47:00.980 --> 3:47:02.980]  Cindy did you know
[3:47:02.980 --> 3:47:04.980]  they're openly announcing a formation
[3:47:04.980 --> 3:47:06.980]  of the world government at this meeting
[3:47:06.980 --> 3:47:08.980]  yes I know they are
[3:47:08.980 --> 3:47:10.980]  I mean even
[3:47:10.980 --> 3:47:12.980]  the head of the EU even spoke out against it
[3:47:12.980 --> 3:47:14.980]  Kloss at the UN
[3:47:14.980 --> 3:47:16.980]  yesterday and they're openly announcing
[3:47:16.980 --> 3:47:18.980]  the end of the dollar those troops
[3:47:18.980 --> 3:47:20.980]  don't know that their whole savings and their whole family
[3:47:20.980 --> 3:47:22.980]  future is gone
[3:47:22.980 --> 3:47:24.980]  and there they are with pleasure
[3:47:24.980 --> 3:47:26.980]  guarding the very government
[3:47:26.980 --> 3:47:28.980]  that is illegitimate and criminal
[3:47:28.980 --> 3:47:30.980]  well I tried to lead a battalion of them
[3:47:30.980 --> 3:47:32.980]  to the G20
[3:47:32.980 --> 3:47:34.980]  so we can arrest the people who are really our enemies
[3:47:34.980 --> 3:47:36.980]  the troops are out here
[3:47:36.980 --> 3:47:38.980]  there are brothers and sisters
[3:47:38.980 --> 3:47:40.980]  there are sons and daughters
[3:47:40.980 --> 3:47:42.980]  and there are mothers and fathers
[3:47:42.980 --> 3:47:44.980]  and they're turning their guns on us
[3:47:44.980 --> 3:47:46.980]  they're turning their weapons on us
[3:47:46.980 --> 3:47:48.980]  where we really should be marching to the G20
[3:47:48.980 --> 3:47:50.980]  these guys
[3:47:50.980 --> 3:47:52.980]  those guys are planning nothing but
[3:47:52.980 --> 3:47:54.980]  destruction
[3:47:54.980 --> 3:47:56.980]  well they're the bankers
[3:47:56.980 --> 3:47:58.980]  they're the bankers that engineered it all
[3:47:58.980 --> 3:48:00.980]  and now they're announcing a new global currency
[3:48:00.980 --> 3:48:02.980]  and the end of the dollar which will destroy our economy
[3:48:02.980 --> 3:48:04.980]  and the police
[3:48:04.980 --> 3:48:06.980]  here they come again with their LRAD
[3:48:06.980 --> 3:48:08.980]  Alex
[3:48:08.980 --> 3:48:10.980]  you see it
[3:48:10.980 --> 3:48:12.980]  well I hear it
[3:48:12.980 --> 3:48:14.980]  they always announce it on a loudspeaker
[3:48:14.980 --> 3:48:16.980]  before they bring it so
[3:48:16.980 --> 3:48:18.980]  there's no where for us to go
[3:48:18.980 --> 3:48:20.980]  CNN is finally covering it
[3:48:20.980 --> 3:48:22.980]  they're only covering a few anarchists
[3:48:22.980 --> 3:48:24.980]  that's Fox excuse me
[3:48:24.980 --> 3:48:26.980]  let's bring Sherry
[3:48:26.980 --> 3:48:28.980]  listen I want to get a report from you
[3:48:28.980 --> 3:48:30.980]  to Mara Cindy we have your cell phone

[3:48:32.980 --> 3:48:34.980]  I'm pretty sure you do
[3:48:34.980 --> 3:48:36.980]  I'm going to push you on hold
[3:48:36.980 --> 3:48:38.980]  we'll make sure Jason has it
[3:48:38.980 --> 3:48:40.980]  I'm going to pass you back to Jason
[3:48:40.980 --> 3:48:42.980]  God bless you Cindy Sheehan
[3:48:42.980 --> 3:48:44.980]  you see the best people
[3:48:44.980 --> 3:48:46.980]  God bless you
[3:48:46.980 --> 3:48:48.980]  you see the best people together in one spot
[3:48:48.980 --> 3:48:50.980]  Burmese what's happening now
[3:48:50.980 --> 3:48:52.980]  right now like I said we're on this side street
[3:48:52.980 --> 3:48:54.980]  we just did get a couple thumbs up
[3:48:54.980 --> 3:48:56.980]  from some of the firefighters that
[3:48:56.980 --> 3:48:58.980]  obviously don't want to be a part of this
[3:48:58.980 --> 3:49:00.980]  they saw Cindy and they obviously are fans of what she does
[3:49:00.980 --> 3:49:02.980]  I heard that
[3:49:02.980 --> 3:49:04.980]  LRAD again it was over to the right
[3:49:04.980 --> 3:49:06.980]  and maybe two blocks up
[3:49:06.980 --> 3:49:08.980]  I can't really see any of the protesters
[3:49:08.980 --> 3:49:10.980]  at this point
[3:49:10.980 --> 3:49:12.980]  we're on train tracks
[3:49:12.980 --> 3:49:14.980]  you can kind of glare into the city
[3:49:14.980 --> 3:49:16.980]  down the train tracks
[3:49:16.980 --> 3:49:18.980]  I can see a couple of officers
[3:49:18.980 --> 3:49:20.980]  and vehicles but nothing to the extent
[3:49:20.980 --> 3:49:22.980]  of where they're cornering people
[3:49:22.980 --> 3:49:24.980]  I mean when they're cornering people
[3:49:24.980 --> 3:49:26.980]  you're talking hundreds of riot cops
[3:49:26.980 --> 3:49:28.980]  no I know but that was going on deeper in the area
[3:49:28.980 --> 3:49:30.980]  you can't see get out of there
[3:49:30.980 --> 3:49:32.980]  call the guys

[3:54:24.980 --> 3:54:26.980]  they're standing and she lost her son

[3:54:30.980 --> 3:54:32.980]  and there are the bankers openly setting up
[3:54:32.980 --> 3:54:34.980]  world government bankrupting us by design
[3:54:36.980 --> 3:54:38.980]  Dr. Sherry Tenpenny
[3:54:38.980 --> 3:54:40.980]  this is how the republic falls with the storm troopers
[3:54:40.980 --> 3:54:42.980]  in the streets and the world leaders
[3:54:42.980 --> 3:54:44.980]  coming to our country to sell it out
[3:54:44.980 --> 3:54:46.980]  in the mainstream news reporting it
[3:54:46.980 --> 3:54:48.980]  yes Alex
[3:54:48.980 --> 3:54:50.980]  why are they in Pittsburgh?
[3:54:50.980 --> 3:54:52.980]  of all the cities in America why Pittsburgh?
[3:54:52.980 --> 3:54:54.980]  because it's got a lot of draconian laws
[3:54:54.980 --> 3:54:56.980]  in Pennsylvania
[3:54:56.980 --> 3:54:58.980]  from what we've seen
[3:54:58.980 --> 3:55:00.980]  they have a local patriot act
[3:55:00.980 --> 3:55:02.980]  a state patriot act
[3:55:02.980 --> 3:55:04.980]  they chose it because
[3:55:04.980 --> 3:55:06.980]  they like cities that have tyranny like London
[3:55:06.980 --> 3:55:08.980]  and DC and places like that
[3:55:08.980 --> 3:55:10.980]  and they've chosen it to come here
[3:55:10.980 --> 3:55:12.980]  and kill the dollar in America it's a big joke to them
[3:55:12.980 --> 3:55:14.980]  I mean it's all over the news world government
[3:55:14.980 --> 3:55:16.980]  end of the dollar
[3:55:16.980 --> 3:55:18.980]  and Ron Paul earlier he's an economist
[3:55:18.980 --> 3:55:20.980]  not his medical doctor he said this will just
[3:55:20.980 --> 3:55:22.980]  it'll be worse than the Great Depression
[3:55:22.980 --> 3:55:24.980]  if they kill the dollar and they are doing it
[3:55:26.980 --> 3:55:28.980]  wow

[3:55:34.980 --> 3:55:36.980]  for weeks months and years
[3:55:36.980 --> 3:55:38.980]  and it looks like it's here
[3:55:38.980 --> 3:55:40.980]  well at least we can expose the flu shot
[3:55:40.980 --> 3:55:42.980]  at least we can get the flyers
[3:55:42.980 --> 3:55:44.980]  the materials and educate people
[3:55:44.980 --> 3:55:46.980]  and speak out of our city councils
[3:55:46.980 --> 3:55:48.980]  this is all at the local level this takeover is happening

[3:56:38.980 --> 3:56:40.980]  the police are taking blood all over the country
[3:56:40.980 --> 3:56:42.980]  without warrants at checkpoints
[3:56:42.980 --> 3:56:44.980]  I mean doctor it's really happening

[3:56:58.980 --> 3:57:00.980]  CNN and on Fox News but
[3:57:00.980 --> 3:57:02.980]  nothing like what your guys on the streets have captured

[3:57:16.980 --> 3:57:18.980]  concerned
[3:57:18.980 --> 3:57:20.980]  San Diegans the LRAD
[3:57:20.980 --> 3:57:22.980]  crowd control is primarily used in Iraq
[3:57:22.980 --> 3:57:24.980]  to control insurgents and can cause serious
[3:57:24.980 --> 3:57:26.980]  and lasting harm to humans
[3:57:26.980 --> 3:57:28.980]  and they admit this

[3:59:12.980 --> 3:59:14.980]  it's like having an electric power plant
