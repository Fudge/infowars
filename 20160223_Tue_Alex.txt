[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:20.760]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.760 --> 00:26.160]  well have you had questions about Donald Trump and is he sincere I think those
[00:26.160 --> 00:32.800]  questions been put to bed talking during the break about Hillary Clinton and if
[00:32.800 --> 00:37.800]  a Republican wins if you win you'll have an attorney general the statute of
[00:37.800 --> 00:41.800]  limitations will not have passed six years actually well look you have no
[00:41.800 --> 00:46.280]  choice I mean we have to solve all sorts of problems and fairness is you have to
[00:46.280 --> 00:49.640]  look into that now maybe she can prove her innocence but it just seems to me
[00:49.640 --> 00:52.760]  that I think the public knows everything that they're gonna know you know the
[00:52.760 --> 00:57.560]  emails have come out and it's it's she seems to be guilty but you know what I
[00:57.560 --> 01:01.660]  wouldn't even say that but certainly it has to be looked at if a Republican
[01:01.660 --> 01:06.200]  wins if I'm winning certainly you will look at that as as being fair to
[01:06.200 --> 01:09.880]  everyone else so unfair to the people that have been prosecuted over the
[01:09.880 --> 01:14.480]  years for doing much less than she did so she's being protected but if I win
[01:14.480 --> 01:18.480]  certainly it's something you think she's running for her own survival I think
[01:18.480 --> 01:21.280]  she's running a very important race the most important race of her life before
[01:21.280 --> 01:25.920]  not just because it's president I mean she's running a very important race I'll
[01:25.920 --> 01:30.280]  bet you that Barack Obama would pardon her before he leaves let's get back to
[01:30.280 --> 01:33.520]  our all right I want to say this about Sean Hannity I've been a big critic of
[01:33.520 --> 01:39.000]  Sean Hannity over the years but the fact that he's not been attacking Trump
[01:39.000 --> 01:44.560]  and has been being fair has really brought him up in my view because the
[01:44.560 --> 01:52.400]  entire Fox News combine other than Hannity and a few others are out to get
[01:52.400 --> 01:55.760]  Donald Trump I mean obviously I monitor Fox News when I exercise in the morning
[01:55.760 --> 02:00.280]  I watch it at night it's one of the few news channels I regularly watch I watch
[02:00.280 --> 02:05.760]  clips of CNN and MSNBC and other channels and ABC News you name it but I do
[02:05.760 --> 02:10.440]  monitor Fox and man they are pushing Marco Rubio like it is the end of the
[02:10.440 --> 02:17.400]  world and remember Ripper Murdoch nine years ago when the first Obama campaign
[02:17.400 --> 02:22.080]  started up a year plus after the election was backing Hillary Clinton and
[02:22.080 --> 02:27.040]  was one of her biggest individual donors and the Fox properties it's come out in
[02:27.040 --> 02:32.840]  the news have directives to push global warming anti family agenda anti father
[02:32.840 --> 02:40.080]  figure agenda he just wants to control the conservatives with Fox News and it's
[02:40.080 --> 02:44.080]  despicable and that's why Fox News is always you know trying to criticize
[02:44.080 --> 02:51.960]  yours truly but Fox News is waning not as fast as other dinosaur media but it's
[02:51.960 --> 02:57.560]  definitely waning but to see Hannity come out and actually you know let Trump
[02:57.560 --> 03:01.760]  talk is a big positive situation but you can see the Republican establishment
[03:01.760 --> 03:06.520]  the Democratic establishment are fully against him Roger Stone big Trump
[03:06.520 --> 03:12.200]  insider former head of his campaign one of the key guys that got him to run was
[03:12.200 --> 03:16.360]  on he'll be in studio Friday he's coming down here just be on the show from
[03:16.360 --> 03:23.440]  New York he said off air he goes oh no Trump can't stand the big banks he can't
[03:23.440 --> 03:26.280]  wait to go out for the Federal Reserve he knows it's you know basically far and
[03:26.280 --> 03:32.680]  owned he's gonna take him to the cleaners no more tax exemption no more free
[03:32.680 --> 03:37.120]  money from them to taxpayers Donald Trump can't stand big banks he said he
[03:37.120 --> 03:41.520]  said I'm gonna talk to him tonight look for him to come out for an audit the Fed
[03:41.520 --> 03:47.440]  called and then Stone called me yesterday and said did you see what
[03:47.440 --> 03:51.280]  Trump just tweeted two minutes ago and I said no and right then Nico runs in as
[03:51.280 --> 03:55.600]  I'm on the phone with Stone I talked to basically daily talk about a hard-working
[03:55.600 --> 04:00.880]  guy and he goes Trump just said we need to audit the Federal Reserve and the Ted
[04:00.880 --> 04:05.360]  Cruz should have been there and shouldn't be missing votes on it so the
[04:05.360 --> 04:10.000]  stories are up on info wars.com Trump calls for auditing the Fed I mean he
[04:10.000 --> 04:13.120]  needs to have a criminal investigation of Hillary if he gets elected he's gonna
[04:13.120 --> 04:18.240]  audit the Fed he's gonna release the 28 pages about Saudi Arabia and 9-11 and
[04:18.240 --> 04:22.600]  the Bushes and the Clintons you don't do this unless you're a hundred percent
[04:22.600 --> 04:28.320]  anti-establishment they wouldn't have an actor doing these type of things they'd
[04:28.320 --> 04:34.080]  be doing fake populist things this is pure Americana and if Donald Trump gets
[04:34.080 --> 04:38.800]  elected and actually does ten percent of what he says he is he'll be the real
[04:38.800 --> 04:47.800]  John Wayne John Wayne will wish he was Donald Trump John Wayne will know the
[04:47.800 --> 04:54.200]  real John Wayne is Donald Trump John Wayne was a patriot and a good guy but
[04:54.200 --> 05:00.360]  he was an actor Donald Trump's in the real world a new study shows that having
[05:00.360 --> 05:04.560]  a mobile phone close to the testicles or within a foot or two of the body can
[05:04.560 --> 05:08.800]  lower sperm levels so much that conceiving could become difficult reports
[05:08.800 --> 05:12.960]  the Telegraph the findings have led to leading British fertility experts to
[05:12.960 --> 05:17.120]  advise men to stop being addicted to mobile phones specialists found that
[05:17.120 --> 05:20.480]  sperm levels of men who kept their phones in their pockets during the day
[05:20.480 --> 05:26.040]  were seriously affected in 47% of cases compared to just 11% in the general
[05:26.040 --> 05:31.040]  population the team monitored more than 100 men attending a fertility clinic
[05:31.040 --> 05:35.800]  for a year even keeping a phone on a bedside table appears to lower sperm
[05:35.800 --> 05:40.400]  counts the quality of sperm among men in Western countries is constantly
[05:40.400 --> 05:45.800]  decreasing by contrast professor Alan Pacey a fertility research scientist at
[05:45.800 --> 05:49.760]  Sheffield University has scoffed at suggestions that mobile phones could be
[05:49.760 --> 05:53.840]  damaging male fertility and insist he will continue to carry his phone in his

[08:58.280 --> 09:02.800]  point doesn't make what does that make Hillary Clinton to the British family my

[09:33.080 --> 09:36.600]  kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport but instead we just ran with
[09:36.600 --> 09:40.360]  our heads down to get into the vehicles

[10:30.080 --> 10:39.680]  at info wars.com forward slash show or info wars news.com Donald Trump has yet
[10:39.680 --> 10:48.400]  again proven that he's the real deal and that he is on something that is akin to
[10:48.400 --> 10:54.200]  a suicide mission now that's a military parlance has been used for hundreds of
[10:54.200 --> 11:02.520]  years it doesn't mean you're going to die but it means chances are you are it
[11:02.520 --> 11:06.320]  means there's more than a 50% chance you're not going to make it and that
[11:06.320 --> 11:11.600]  people that tried what you're about to do didn't make it that's a suicide mission
[11:11.600 --> 11:21.160]  and Donald Trump is the man on the arena on a suicide mission and it's easy for
[11:21.160 --> 11:26.560]  other people who aren't in the arena to point their finger at him and I had
[11:26.560 --> 11:30.080]  questions I don't like casinos when I'm a libertarian you have a right to be part
[11:30.080 --> 11:36.280]  of that he's more like hotel casinos both but he's in entertainment he's a
[11:36.280 --> 11:43.440]  builder he has brought a lot of jobs to this country he's called for auditing the
[11:43.440 --> 11:48.720]  private Federal Reserve yesterday he is saying that Hillary Clinton that needs
[11:48.720 --> 11:51.960]  to be prosecuted and he will prosecute her he'll call for prosecution of his
[11:51.960 --> 11:57.000]  president but show TV viewers a shot of that right now drudge report calm Trump
[11:57.000 --> 12:02.000]  all prosecute Hillary as president I'm gonna play a clip from Fox on Hannity
[12:02.000 --> 12:09.200]  during a town hall we were talking during the break about Hillary Clinton and
[12:09.200 --> 12:15.080]  if a Republican wins if you win you'll have an attorney general the statute of
[12:15.080 --> 12:19.080]  limitations will not have passed six years actually well look you have no
[12:19.080 --> 12:23.600]  choice I mean we have to solve all sorts of problems and fairness is you have to
[12:23.600 --> 12:26.960]  look into that now maybe she can prove her innocence but it just seems to me
[12:26.960 --> 12:30.080]  that I think the public knows everything that they're gonna know you know the
[12:30.080 --> 12:34.880]  emails have come out and it's it's she seems to be guilty but you know what I
[12:34.880 --> 12:39.000]  wouldn't even say that but certainly it has to be looked at if a Republican
[12:39.000 --> 12:43.560]  wins if I'm winning certainly you will look at that as as being fair to
[12:43.560 --> 12:47.240]  everyone else so unfair to the people that have been prosecuted over the
[12:47.240 --> 12:51.840]  years for doing much less than she did so she's being protected but if I win
[12:51.840 --> 12:55.640]  certainly it's something so you think she's running for her own survival I
[12:55.640 --> 12:58.320]  think she's running a very important race the most important race of her life
[12:58.320 --> 13:02.920]  before not just because it's president I mean she's running a very important race
[13:02.920 --> 13:07.360]  I'll bet you that Barack Obama would pardon her before he leaves let's get
[13:07.360 --> 13:11.360]  back to our very well said Hannity very well said and again I'll give it to
[13:11.360 --> 13:17.640]  Hannity he's one of the only people not viciously lying about Donald Trump on
[13:17.640 --> 13:22.760]  Fox News I mean I watch it they do little slick lies and it's constant in
[13:22.760 --> 13:30.040]  force-feeding Marco Rubio who is one of the biggest flip-floppers ever and if
[13:30.040 --> 13:33.920]  the Democrats would probably rather have than Hillary
[13:35.800 --> 13:41.280]  now let me before I get into all this news and and get into a video that's up
[13:41.280 --> 13:47.760]  at drudgereport.com right there in the middle of the second column Obama
[13:47.760 --> 13:54.240]  cracks a joke about Scalia's death we had C-span on in the back office we've got
[13:54.240 --> 13:59.880]  C-span CNN Fox MSNBC CNBC we switch around we've got like six TVs on around
[13:59.880 --> 14:02.520]  the building just so even when you're having a coffee or you know taking a
[14:02.520 --> 14:10.200]  break you're monitoring news and Rob Jacobson runs in he goes on C-span Obama
[14:10.200 --> 14:14.040]  just cracked a joke about Scalia's death and nobody else had this we went to
[14:14.040 --> 14:19.280]  whitehouse.gov and found it put it up drudge report link to it video Obama
[14:19.280 --> 14:22.360]  cracks joke about Scalia's death we're gonna get to this in a moment because
[14:22.360 --> 14:27.000]  it's such a big deal for radio listeners it'll be disturbing but if you
[14:27.000 --> 14:35.760]  actually go watch the video I was busy around the office I said yeah Rob great
[14:35.760 --> 14:38.960]  idea of you know put the video up have them write an article about it and I
[14:38.960 --> 14:46.640]  moved on down the hallway and then I didn't watch it so last night and I
[14:46.640 --> 14:56.240]  watched it probably five or six times and I'll be honest with you I don't
[14:56.240 --> 15:07.840]  scare easily and I got scared because I'm not afraid of myself dying but I've
[15:07.840 --> 15:10.560]  got to take care of my family and my children but I'm afraid of my country
[15:10.560 --> 15:17.520]  dying and I studied history in depth when you get people like Hillary saying
[15:17.520 --> 15:21.600]  we came we saw he died and bragging about you know killing people and Obama
[15:21.600 --> 15:26.440]  saying I'm good at killing people and they have no military background they
[15:26.440 --> 15:31.440]  both admit they never even been in fistfights. Carson came out and said
[15:31.440 --> 15:38.680]  Obama's not black he's not folks I grew up in Dallas where half my school was
[15:38.680 --> 15:45.120]  black he doesn't act like any black person I've ever known he grew up with a
[15:45.120 --> 15:50.320]  bunch of CIA white yuppies that raised him and his weirdo communist father
[15:50.320 --> 15:56.400]  Frank Marshall Davis but they admit he stayed summers with and and Carson is
[15:56.400 --> 16:01.720]  absolutely right he said quote he was raised white doesn't understand black
[16:01.720 --> 16:07.560]  Americans he wasn't just raised white he was raised CIA Ford Foundation elitist
[16:07.560 --> 16:19.560]  level he was groomed and prepared for his role from the youngest days and that's
[16:19.560 --> 16:22.960]  what's scary is these people are starting war with China I've got a stack of
[16:22.960 --> 16:26.600]  news here war with Russia they want to start a war with the liberty movement
[16:26.600 --> 16:30.520]  they openly demonize veterans on TV they openly demonize Christians they
[16:30.520 --> 16:35.600]  openly demonize families and I was just scared of the fact that we are in the
[16:35.600 --> 16:43.000]  hands of such scum and then I saw Congressman Issa on Fox this morning and
[16:43.000 --> 16:49.120]  he made a great point which he wasn't supporting Rubio but he said the
[16:49.120 --> 16:52.600]  military is basically in revolt at the highest levels against Obama and the
[16:52.600 --> 16:56.080]  things he's been doing and if he continues to act unilaterally the
[16:56.080 --> 17:02.640]  military is going to probably block him and by the way that's on Fox news with
[17:02.640 --> 17:09.440]  one of the chairman of the most powerful committees in Congress and Fox news
[17:09.440 --> 17:14.080]  didn't even know what they were hearing and you know I'm afraid of military
[17:14.080 --> 17:18.080]  goods because they usually go bad in Latin America or wherever but you know
[17:18.080 --> 17:21.680]  in Germany they finally try to stand up against Hitler operation Valkyrie failed
[17:21.680 --> 17:25.040]  I'm not calling for that I don't want any of that because it's a big bureaucracy
[17:25.040 --> 17:29.680]  you roll up Obama you or Hillary I mean you know it's like shark teeth there's
[17:29.680 --> 17:38.200]  a hundred layers more shark teeth roll up you got to get rid of the whole shark
[17:38.200 --> 17:42.240]  takes a big harpoon gun to do that you got to focus on the shark not on their
[17:42.240 --> 17:48.920]  minions but military already said no about backing Al Qaeda three years ago
[17:48.920 --> 17:56.120]  in Syria and then ISIS and sort of giving Russians intel now that's them
[17:56.120 --> 18:02.360]  that is the military in a counter coup that is over-the-top information and
[18:02.360 --> 18:06.040]  of course we told you about that first from our sources in the Pentagon some
[18:06.040 --> 18:09.680]  that came on the show to great risk to themselves you know what happens when

[24:57.280 --> 25:00.640]  cracks Scalia death joke now if you're again if you're a radio listener you
[25:00.640 --> 25:06.280]  must go to drudge report calm because one problem with info wars is news just
[25:06.280 --> 25:08.840]  scrolls off even if it's the most important stuff we've got up there
[25:08.840 --> 25:12.840]  probably reposts the front page this was put up there yesterday afternoon but
[25:12.840 --> 25:16.920]  it's still the top story in the middle column Obama cracks joke about Scalia's
[25:16.920 --> 25:25.360]  death and you need to forward this to everybody you know and of course we
[25:25.360 --> 25:29.040]  have a cartoon up on the real Alex Jones Twitter you can take this with you
[25:29.040 --> 25:36.000]  from the great cartoonist Ben Carson Antonin Scalia 1936 to 2016 as he throws
[25:36.000 --> 25:39.640]  the Constitution Bill of Rights Declaration of Independence and we the
[25:39.640 --> 25:50.440]  people in the grave with them now it's the body language it's how he looks at
[25:50.440 --> 25:53.680]  the crowd and what people comment and say we're slowing this down and listening
[25:53.680 --> 25:58.800]  to what some of his minions say he goes you know like a point new Supreme
[25:58.800 --> 26:04.120]  Court justices knowing he waits for the joke they make comments and he does this
[26:04.120 --> 26:11.000]  Joker-esque demonic face this this this tell this celebration this dance on the
[26:11.000 --> 26:15.000]  grave of Scalia just like he did about you know I'm really good at killing
[26:15.000 --> 26:22.000]  people really good at it you know Hillary I came I saw he died and there's
[26:22.000 --> 26:28.880]  nothing worse you know in the Irish or Jewish or Italian mafia any mafia Dixie
[26:28.880 --> 26:33.280]  mafia you name it you couldn't even really get into the group if you hadn't
[26:33.280 --> 26:37.360]  separately been a criminal but a criminal that was honorable that meant you
[26:37.360 --> 26:40.600]  didn't snitch and you'd already killed somebody usually by the time you're about
[26:40.600 --> 26:46.480]  15 you just had to be a killer anyways naturally you went out and killed
[26:46.480 --> 26:54.800]  somebody you don't to be told to go kill somebody oh Ben Garrison said that the
[26:54.800 --> 27:01.800]  cartoonist we're teleprompter free here folks and continuing
[27:03.120 --> 27:12.120]  looking at this you have people that haven't killed anyone themselves
[27:12.120 --> 27:17.680]  personally but they love to sit back and talk about it like it's tough and it's
[27:17.680 --> 27:22.360]  cool like all these neocon chicken hawks that dodge the draft in some cases
[27:22.360 --> 27:35.960]  more than 11 or 12 times they're truly truly sickening people so let's go ahead
[27:35.960 --> 27:40.920]  and play this video but I'm gonna have Rob Jacobson slow it down so we can play
[27:40.920 --> 27:45.680]  it next hour so we could and then blow the video up so we can really look at
[27:45.680 --> 28:03.280]  this scripted distasteful hateful comment a day after Antonin Scalia was
[28:03.280 --> 28:10.560]  put six feet under let's go to Obama like me some of you might be in the
[28:10.560 --> 28:16.280]  final year of your last term working as hard as you can to get as much done as
[28:16.280 --> 28:21.920]  possible for the folks that you represent fixing roads educating our
[28:21.920 --> 28:27.480]  children helping people retrain appointing judges now he takes the
[28:27.480 --> 28:40.720]  usual stuff so cute little celebration there let's back that up again and play
[28:40.720 --> 28:46.360]  it one more time it's scripted it's scripted with the press corps scripted
[28:46.360 --> 28:49.560]  with his little buddies in there and we're gonna turn the audio up I want to
[28:49.560 --> 28:53.920]  really go in here who the front row comment is an Obama nods to him and
[28:53.920 --> 28:59.400]  smiles even more this is really a bunch of hyenas celebrating their pleasure at
[28:59.400 --> 29:05.200]  someone's death bare minimum here it is like me some of you might be in the
[29:05.200 --> 29:10.840]  final year of your last term working as hard as you can to get as much done as
[29:10.840 --> 29:14.800]  possible bring over the folks that you represent it bring on the country fixing
[29:14.800 --> 29:22.400]  roads educating our children helping people retrain appointing judges the
[29:22.400 --> 29:39.120]  usual stuff and it just goes on from there that's how sick these people are
[29:39.120 --> 29:43.680]  that's speaking to members of Congress and the press we'll be back with the
[29:43.680 --> 29:48.400]  latest on the campaign and so much more this is an important broadcast we're on
[29:48.400 --> 29:58.840]  the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network in
[29:58.840 --> 30:04.480]  addition to threatening to invade Syria and al-bashar al-Assad Saudi Arabia says
[30:04.480 --> 30:08.920]  it wants to arm jihadist in the country with anti-aircraft missiles to take out
[30:08.920 --> 30:13.520]  Russian jets we believe that introducing surface-to-air missiles in Syria is
[30:13.520 --> 30:17.260]  going to change the balance of power on the ground said the Saudi foreign
[30:17.260 --> 30:21.760]  minister he continued it will allow the moderate opposition to be able to
[30:21.760 --> 30:25.560]  neutralize the helicopters and aircraft that are dropping chemicals and have
[30:25.560 --> 30:29.380]  been carpet bombing them just like the surface-to-air missiles in Afghanistan
[30:29.380 --> 30:33.360]  were able to change the balance of power there this has to be studied very
[30:33.360 --> 30:37.680]  carefully however because you don't want such weaponry to fall into the wrong
[30:37.680 --> 30:42.400]  hands even the New York Times admits there are few if any moderate rebels
[30:42.400 --> 30:47.560]  fighting in Syria despite this reality Secretary of State John Kerry and British
[30:47.560 --> 30:51.200]  Prime Minister David Cameron continue to insist there are moderates fighting

[35:54.200 --> 36:00.200]  these people are ridiculously tyrannical they're authoritarian they're horrible
[36:00.200 --> 36:07.320]  and they want you to be poor so they can micromanage you in their own admissions
[36:09.840 --> 36:16.320]  we're gonna play this video coming up MSNBC censor Sanders condemning TPP
[36:16.320 --> 36:22.160]  Comcast the owner MSNBC benefits from TPP MSNBC cut away from its live
[36:22.160 --> 36:25.120]  coverage of Bernie Sanders press conference once again to begin to
[36:25.120 --> 36:29.400]  condemn the controversial trans-Pacific partnership social media exploded and
[36:29.400 --> 36:33.280]  they always do it folks this is how they're controlling you mean Americans
[36:33.280 --> 36:36.320]  might find out there's a secret multinational treaty taking us over but
[36:36.320 --> 36:42.160]  that's not capitalism that's the very same Goldman Sachs JP Morgan global gang
[36:42.160 --> 36:48.720]  that is financing dictatorships and communism worldwide to control people but
[36:48.720 --> 36:52.720]  yes Sanders is better than Hillary I've really pondered this and I can't stand
[36:52.720 --> 36:55.880]  him in the fake intellectualism and the and the and the and the and the dumb
[36:55.880 --> 36:58.760]  followers that can hardly talk and think they're intellectual because they're
[36:58.760 --> 37:03.680]  getting worthless degrees for for jobs that don't exist but at least his
[37:03.680 --> 37:07.640]  followers mean well and want to change things they're not like these
[37:07.640 --> 37:11.280]  establishment Democrats and establishment Republicans that get off on
[37:11.280 --> 37:14.400]  thinking they're part of the elite because they they go along with the

[39:36.880 --> 39:42.280]  dramatic effects I just say there must be somebody out there didn't work for I
[39:42.280 --> 39:46.000]  didn't have the big effect till two days after I did the cleanse and I was like
[39:46.000 --> 39:50.680]  hey what's going on and then it happened I was like oh my gosh info wars life
[39:50.680 --> 39:54.040]  calm you can see the videos were people that have done it break it now or Dr.

[39:56.760 --> 40:00.160]  your family advanced liver cleanse pack with the oxy powder or just get liver
[40:00.160 --> 40:03.880]  shield by itself you can also just take that daily in force life calm but do not
[40:03.880 --> 40:09.960]  drink when you're doing the detox because it just opens up your liver it
[40:09.960 --> 40:12.760]  opens up the gallbladder and then you don't have really a defense that stuff
[40:12.760 --> 40:17.880]  is just coming right through go listen to the experts I'm just giving my
[40:17.880 --> 40:23.280]  personal view on it and what I've experienced in force life calm and look
[40:23.280 --> 40:28.920]  at these reviews by Danny and Stockton California no side effects produces
[40:28.920 --> 40:32.600]  results simple to take I'm 41 years old and consumed at least two energy drinks
[40:32.600 --> 40:36.480]  a day since I started using no vitality I no longer feel the need for them yeah
[40:36.480 --> 40:41.800]  it's it's just a total mood changer for me and libido muscle weight loss is what
[40:41.800 --> 40:46.640]  is the effect I've had and there's a lot of other here's a liver shield review
[40:46.640 --> 40:52.720]  awesome product used to do the liver cleanse did not follow the exact diet and
[40:52.720 --> 40:55.880]  connection but still did everything they said it would get an awesome job
[40:55.880 --> 41:02.320]  excellent we'll definitely get more per daily general health and that is the one
[41:02.320 --> 41:07.640]  CHC2 in Tulsa, Oklahoma did everything suggested is what he said was the pros
[41:07.640 --> 41:12.200]  cons and nine they'll read the five star reviews folks like a 4.8 review on
[41:12.200 --> 41:15.160]  that product overall the thousands of reviews and we're not playing games here
[41:15.160 --> 41:18.480]  we can't even keep this stuff in stock and we can't lower the quality of the
[41:18.480 --> 41:23.080]  formula I just said is there some way to just find it and keep it in stock and
[41:23.080 --> 41:26.120]  know we just can't get the proper herbs and keep it in stock so when it's
[41:26.120 --> 41:29.240]  available it's kind of like it's seasonal because it is seasonal some of
[41:29.240 --> 41:32.280]  these herbs are seasonal and we have to get them all organic certified in
[41:32.280 --> 41:36.240]  California level tested build a past the strictest strictest standards
[41:36.240 --> 41:39.440]  because we know we're a target and we want to have quality but at a certain
[41:39.440 --> 41:42.640]  point I'm like come on I want it I mean you know what it'd be like we're so
[41:42.640 --> 41:46.040]  perfect we can't even have it but I'm just being honest about my discussions
[41:46.040 --> 41:50.280]  I mean I'm trying as hard as I can but that's just how we're doing in highest
[41:50.280 --> 41:56.760]  insane standard in fourslife.com okay I want to go through some phone calls
[41:56.760 --> 42:02.280]  here with Terry, Jeremy, Brian, Robert and many others that are
[42:02.280 --> 42:07.440]  patiently holding but for me the big deal is we are going under private
[42:07.440 --> 42:09.880]  corporate world government it's trying to get rid of free speech worldwide
[42:09.880 --> 42:13.440]  trying to break up the family make us all just buy ourselves so they can pray
[42:13.440 --> 42:17.280]  on us that's what predators want is you know people cut out from the herd well
[42:17.280 --> 42:25.280]  they just want us all absolutely on our knees and then there's Trump thumbing his
[42:25.280 --> 42:30.600]  nose in the entire agenda and believe me I've researched this he wouldn't be
[42:30.600 --> 42:37.320]  saying these things if it was just for rhetoric to get elected as a populist the
[42:37.320 --> 42:41.000]  things he's doing the system I can see their body language everything they're
[42:41.000 --> 42:44.720]  doing Trump is deftifying he's decided he wants to be truly great he doesn't
[42:44.720 --> 42:48.720]  want to just run beauty pageants and own hotels I used to see him on TV and stuff
[42:48.720 --> 42:51.360]  and didn't like his demeanor I could tell he was just doing an act this is the
[42:51.360 --> 42:57.200]  real Trump and he glows with those crowds and I've been around people that
[42:57.200 --> 43:01.120]  know Trump very very well and they say no I was told this before it was in the
[43:01.120 --> 43:09.000]  news it was in a political story he was how he did it and he knew they'd
[43:09.000 --> 43:12.600]  probably come after him and and he for weeks wasn't even sure and kind of
[43:12.600 --> 43:19.720]  went into seclusion over in Scotland to make his decision and he's fully
[43:19.720 --> 43:23.080]  committed and it's good to see a man fully committed and doing the right
[43:23.080 --> 43:30.600]  thing and it's deftifying it's deftifying he's on a suicide mission and
[43:30.600 --> 43:34.800]  again a suicide mission doesn't mean he's going to be killed but it means
[43:34.800 --> 43:40.320]  that this is a mission where I think he's gonna sweet I think that he's got
[43:40.320 --> 43:43.120]  too big a landslide they're not gonna be able to cheat him he's in a game
[43:43.120 --> 43:47.920]  momentum and they'll either manufacture scandals or they will try to build
[43:47.920 --> 43:51.360]  they'll blow his airplane up and they won't care that everybody knows they
[43:51.360 --> 43:56.960]  killed him they'll go how dumb that you say you know his airplane blew up and
[43:56.960 --> 44:01.360]  it was I mean I remember blowing up Senator Hightower's plane well I met
[44:01.360 --> 44:04.400]  his son spent about three hours with him interesting guy that we ought to get
[44:04.400 --> 44:08.240]  Senator Hightower's son on he said he'd come on I met him out in LA at a movie
[44:08.240 --> 44:12.840]  stars house really interesting guy I'm talking about all sorts of wild stuff
[44:12.840 --> 44:22.520]  but he's doctor by the way but I'm digressing that's huge I want to go
[44:22.520 --> 44:30.480]  to your calls then coming up look at this military stat just just just look
[44:30.480 --> 44:35.320]  at what they're doing to us look at the danger they're putting us in Hillary
[44:35.320 --> 44:43.600]  and Obama I mean a bunch of leftist establishment con artist mafia trash they're
[44:43.600 --> 44:50.080]  trying to say Trump's mafia with with no mafia connections and then you've got
[44:50.080 --> 44:57.440]  known mafia but again it's branding it's like the FBI says oh this is about
[44:57.440 --> 44:59.800]  getting into a terrorist phone no it's about getting rid of encryption and
[44:59.800 --> 45:04.040]  that's admitted and it's like mafia people even the word is Italian as if
[45:04.040 --> 45:08.840]  Italians are the only ones of organized crime they weren't as good at it and
[45:08.840 --> 45:12.960]  didn't take over the political system and got shut down and got knocked out of
[45:12.960 --> 45:18.560]  the way it just shows how the they program everybody they just program
[45:18.560 --> 45:25.640]  everybody where they just accept things and those things aren't accurate like
[45:25.640 --> 45:30.760]  Obamacare being free it's a giant rip-off they have planted people in the
[45:30.760 --> 45:33.520]  audience and say oh I got free healthcare because of it you know in these
[45:33.520 --> 45:36.880]  town halls I mean it's just so scripted folks and people are seeing through that
[45:36.880 --> 45:39.160]  so what is the establishment gonna do you I mean are you really gonna kill
[45:39.160 --> 45:42.120]  Donald Trump because this is only the beginning of the revolution against
[45:42.120 --> 45:44.440]  tyranny
[45:44.680 --> 45:49.880]  Minutemen ICBM that's intercontinental ballistic missile sores over California as
[45:49.880 --> 45:59.160]  US Air Force runs test launch but this time without causing a UFO scare look at
[45:59.160 --> 46:03.800]  this the US military may put more weapons in South China Sea look at this
[46:03.800 --> 46:07.200]  one Saudi's call for arming Syrian jihadists with anti-aircraft missiles
[46:07.200 --> 46:10.440]  yeah arm al Qaeda and ISIS with that to shoot down Russian planes they've
[46:10.440 --> 46:13.200]  already got them they're just rolling out the idea they're getting ready to use
[46:13.200 --> 46:17.160]  them they got them at Benghazi told you three years ago Turkish military
[46:17.160 --> 46:23.000]  cooperate with ISIS on border telephone call reveals Saudi Arabia lead surge in
[46:23.000 --> 46:27.560]  arms imports by Middle East states that's just some of the news we're gonna
[46:27.560 --> 46:30.720]  get to but right now let's start going to your phone calls and I want you to a
[46:30.720 --> 46:35.040]  lot of folks your comment your question let's just move the next person I want
[46:35.040 --> 46:42.760]  to go to Terry in Minnesota thanks for calling you're on the year Terry go
[46:42.760 --> 46:47.560]  ahead Terry yep all right we'll move on to the next person I know what's been
[46:47.560 --> 46:51.480]  going on on our phone system too I had some problems Sunday let's go ahead and
[46:51.480 --> 46:57.480]  talk to Robert in Ohio Robert you're on the year hello yes go ahead okay I want
[46:57.480 --> 47:02.600]  her to talk about Scalilla I read the book a breathe no evil by Steven quail
[47:02.600 --> 47:08.160]  and he's in that book he stated that Scalilla was okay with the mad scientist
[47:08.160 --> 47:13.120]  experiments on our troops or have you ever read that book I have read that
[47:13.120 --> 47:15.560]  book and I never said Scalilla was perfect I think you're talking about a
[47:15.560 --> 47:20.080]  ruling with the Pentagon that they could do testing on troops as long as it was
[47:20.080 --> 47:24.520]  authorized by Congress but I don't know the particular case but but what do you
[47:24.520 --> 47:28.080]  think of Obama's comments about Scalilla what do you think about Trump's thing on
[47:28.080 --> 47:32.480]  the Federal Reserve that's the question I was asking today Robert I think that
[47:32.480 --> 47:36.360]  Obama is one of the most corrupt evil people that ever lived and I think
[47:36.360 --> 47:40.840]  there's at least 20 reasons to hang him for treason and then getting to Trump
[47:40.840 --> 47:47.240]  have you ever read the book I written by Al Martin the conspirators no I haven't
[47:47.240 --> 47:52.480]  interviewed Al Martin you have do you believe him or not oh you've never heard
[47:52.480 --> 47:55.760]  of him then that's funny I just said I've interviewed him listen I appreciate
[47:55.760 --> 48:00.760]  your call I have interviewed him many times yes and I he's kind of more of a
[48:00.760 --> 48:05.760]  Democrat but an interesting guy I really can't pass judgment on people thank
[48:05.760 --> 48:10.360]  you I'm gonna try some more calls now see what happens here let's go ahead and
[48:10.360 --> 48:15.280]  talk to Brian in Georgia you're on the air thanks for calling
[48:15.280 --> 48:22.400]  okay well yeah go ahead we're taking calls mm-hmm oh hey how are you doing Alex good brother I'm
[48:22.400 --> 48:27.360]  doing all right what's on your mind today so this is in regards to Scalilla in
[48:27.360 --> 48:32.960]  the fact that we received no autopsy reports or even allowed to do it yeah I
[48:32.960 --> 48:35.400]  thought that was a little suspicious what do you think of Obama making a joke
[48:35.400 --> 48:40.120]  about it well since he's made a joke about it just tosses it back and brings
[48:40.120 --> 48:44.400]  it back to even stuff that people like you know dr. Nick Vegas for research that
[48:44.400 --> 48:48.360]  we can you know kind of potentially get rid of people control people's minds
[48:48.360 --> 48:53.560]  influence other people without you know a paper trail or anything like referring
[48:53.560 --> 48:57.120]  back to the Obama administration sure they can also just put a block of dry
[48:57.120 --> 49:03.360]  ice under his bed and suck all the oxygen out of the room yeah potentially well
[49:03.360 --> 49:07.480]  that's how you kill them or you put a drop of nicotine on them's a pure
[49:07.480 --> 49:15.280]  nicotine would make him have a heart attack yep yep and it's all something that could be covered up about an autopsy and something that simple oh but we're
[49:15.280 --> 49:18.680]  not supposed to ask questions about that what do you think of Obama cracking jokes
[49:18.680 --> 49:23.320]  about it all the fact that he's cracking jokes about it just shows that he thinks
[49:23.320 --> 49:27.040]  he is one of the elite and believes that he is untouchable and if we put
[49:27.040 --> 49:33.160]  someone in office for say like Donald Trump his goal is to actually show what
[49:33.160 --> 49:38.880]  these people have done and when it results back to him wanting to you know
[49:38.880 --> 49:42.320]  try Hillary for her lies and everything she's told the government long about
[49:42.320 --> 49:48.320]  emails etc etc it's kind of lose on their part they keep digging themselves
[49:48.320 --> 49:52.480]  into a deeper hole by absolutely no lying and right point right point Brian I
[49:52.480 --> 49:57.920]  appreciate your call I want to get more calls in when we come back and one
[49:57.920 --> 50:02.120]  problem with the callers is I go to the calls and then they had a button and it's
[50:02.120 --> 50:08.160]  a classic telephone system it goes and and for some reason folks don't realize
[50:08.160 --> 50:10.640]  that they're on the air because they don't hear their names I need to kind of
[50:10.640 --> 50:15.760]  say it a couple times like we're gonna talk to Robert in FEMA region for now
[50:15.760 --> 50:19.880]  let's go to Robert and then he'll actually hear me so so so that's part of
[50:19.880 --> 50:23.120]  the disconnect here with what's happening to this whole thing where people
[50:23.120 --> 50:28.600]  go hello hello and I'm not really a complaining person but when you're
[50:28.600 --> 50:31.920]  doing radio for 20 plus years and you just deal with that over and over again it
[50:31.920 --> 50:35.320]  makes you want to you know jump out of a tall building I'm joking but you'll
[50:35.320 --> 50:40.400]  figuratively we're gonna come back going to the next hour with more calls as
[50:40.400 --> 50:44.160]  well a lot of breaking news a lot of key information to cover obviously on the

[55:36.240 --> 55:40.600]  stuff every single day and I know this from experience I had Lyme disease which
[55:40.600 --> 55:44.360]  destroys your joints some people take disability I was speaking to someone
[55:44.360 --> 55:46.920]  actually they don't even work anymore because they had Lyme disease by the way
[55:46.920 --> 55:50.040]  that that came from Plum Island and Nazi scientists it's on record
[55:50.040 --> 55:54.920]  Congress has had hearings about it it is basically weaponized syphilis they just
[55:54.920 --> 55:58.320]  call it Lyme disease but you were able I mean we'll tell your story briefly I
[55:58.320 --> 56:01.560]  mean this is how you got into health news when you were 14 years old started
[56:01.560 --> 56:06.160]  your own website because you couldn't get well with the doctors you went out to
[56:06.160 --> 56:09.360]  the herbal sites you got better yeah it's true I went to sleep to take a nap at
[56:09.360 --> 56:13.120]  about 5 p.m. and I woke up around 5 p.m. the next day I didn't realize I'd slept
[56:13.120 --> 56:16.720]  for about 24 hours I didn't remember what was happening I went to the doctor they
[56:16.720 --> 56:20.080]  said wow you really do have Lyme disease they did the tests they gave me the
[56:20.080 --> 56:24.080]  steroids it wasn't doing anything I took natural medicine it started working my
[56:24.080 --> 56:28.080]  doctor who went to Harvard was freaked out and just couldn't believe it now he
[56:28.080 --> 56:32.040]  actually listens to the show and uses our products by the way but back then he
[56:32.040 --> 56:35.040]  said that's this is insane you know there's no way natural I was going for
[56:35.040 --> 56:40.040]  memory how old were you I was about 14 14 years old and man it just it just
[56:40.040 --> 56:43.880]  really changed my life for the worst and the best because I learned so much but I
[56:43.880 --> 56:47.720]  still have the joint pain I still have the neck pain and I've been taking
[56:47.720 --> 56:50.800]  supplements that include the ingredients in this product you know
[56:50.800 --> 56:54.240]  independently paying 20 bucks for the turmeric paying 20 bucks for the holy
[56:54.240 --> 56:58.600]  basil leaf but now we've added it all together into one formula that actually
[56:58.600 --> 57:02.320]  supports healthy joints and normal function it makes that's why knockout so
[57:02.320 --> 57:06.280]  good it's the same serving everything else has just you know 10 ingredients all
[57:06.280 --> 57:10.720]  the at the same price or less I mean tell folks about the ingredients in this
[57:10.720 --> 57:14.300]  baby right so instead of going out let's say you can buy some turmeric which
[57:14.300 --> 57:18.560]  man is one of the most powerful things ever this has nine key ingredients all
[57:18.560 --> 57:22.120]  of which normally you'd go out for something like joint comfort you'd go
[57:22.120 --> 57:25.360]  out and buy these individually and pay 20 bucks we've got the turmeric root
[57:25.360 --> 57:30.520]  extract the holy basil leaf which by the way in Ayurveda and Indian medicine is
[57:30.520 --> 57:35.800]  called the incomparable one for a reason ginger root Chinese skull cap and
[57:35.800 --> 57:39.280]  we've got tons of other ingredients if you look at it turmeric which is one of
[57:39.280 --> 57:43.640]  the key ingredients in this goes back five to five thousand BC by the way this
[57:43.640 --> 57:47.080]  stuff isn't just for joints yeah I mean look at the turmeric and what it's known
[57:47.080 --> 57:50.840]  to do the truth is we can't make claims on here you know about these products
[57:50.840 --> 57:54.400]  just look up look it up for yourself exactly you know we could really get
[57:54.400 --> 57:58.440]  into a ginger root and I mean they admit ginger is a big anti-inflammatory just
[57:58.440 --> 58:03.360]  turmeric and we can't even get into the studies unfortunately there's 4580
[58:03.360 --> 58:07.120]  studies on turmeric from the National Library and they want to shut all this
[58:07.120 --> 58:10.240]  down folks I mean they admit that they want to be able to patent it all take it
[58:10.240 --> 58:14.640]  all over because this stuff just is incredible info wars life calm stay with

[01:01:24.460 --> 01:01:31.680]  I'm sorry go ahead brother anyways Alex you remember Neil Bort yes I do remember
[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:36.840]  Neil Bort's it's funny I pulled up a YouTube video of you confronting him at
[01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:40.600]  some sort of convention or something like that. It was at ground zero it was at
[01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:44.600]  ground zero yeah yeah that's right. He came over started cussing at me as what
[01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:48.440]  happened so I got the camera guy over there and I guess he thought since he
[01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:52.520]  was like six foot five that I was intimidated by that I mean I'll just
[01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:55.880]  climb up on top of him that'd be the end of it those big guys fall pretty hard
[01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:59.640]  when their head goes down I'm just joking the point is is that I like a lot of
[01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:03.560]  what Neil Bort's had to say I like Neil Bort's but he would misrepresent what
[01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:09.800]  I had to say but but what about Neil Bort's. Anyways Neil Bort still still does
[01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:15.400]  a commentary piece on WSB in Atlanta occasionally after since he's retired but
[01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:20.640]  he he had a very interesting piece yesterday he put on about Donald Trump
[01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:28.560]  and basically saying that the media is planning a huge blitz against him after
[01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:33.200]  he gets the nomination. Yeah well no that's the new spin on Fox and everywhere
[01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:37.040]  better not go for Trump they're gonna go after him after he gets the nomination
[01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:41.240]  we're in a trap we know we're in a trap with Hillary we know we're in a trap
[01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:46.400]  with Rubio it doesn't matter we're all in but but what's he saying don't vote for
[01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:51.160]  Trump's end. Not well he's saying that you know he's obviously he's the front
[01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:54.760]  runner he's probably one of our only choices at this point but they're
[01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:58.920]  holding back some major information from develop as they found on on some mob
[01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:03.880]  ties some some of the shady business interests that you know with the casino
[01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:07.680]  industry. I bet he's actually we're talking about an Italian name. Am I the only one that
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:11.280]  has deja vu every single time this happens it's like you better watch out
[01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:14.640]  they're really gonna get Trump this time and then he does something else I'm
[01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:16.760]  like they're really gonna get him this time they've been saying it over and over
[01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:19.960]  and over again every single time because they're afraid that he's real and
[01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:22.840]  they're afraid that he's gonna say well no I mean what the caller I'm glad the
[01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:27.360]  caller said this because watching CNN and Fox this morning for an hour okay well
[01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:32.320]  I was working out I had the volume way up all they were saying was mob ties
[01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:35.920]  they're coming after him he's gonna get shot down boy Hillary smart once he gets
[01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:40.640]  in she'll defeat him handily. Hillary is a mobster is a gangster has all these
[01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:44.880]  crimes she's on fire she's coughs everywhere she goes she looks like she's
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:49.240]  about to die Bill looks like day of the dead literally I would cast him as a
[01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:53.600]  zombie right now. Maybe his mob tie was Hillary Clinton actually. Well yeah I was
[01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:56.040]  about to say his only problems I have is that he had to work with Hillary in
[01:03:56.040 --> 01:04:01.080]  New York and of course casinos have that that flavor the mob was kicked out of
[01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:05.600]  casinos in Vegas by the 70s it's run by big corporations and hotels you got to
[01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:09.640]  be so clean it's ridiculous because they're so dirty you understand it's
[01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:14.720]  big multinational corporations they want that stuff run like a fine machine okay
[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:19.480]  and I have a problem that he's involved in casinos but that's not mob and of
[01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:22.520]  course they're gonna bring out a bunch of stuff but all I'm saying is there's

[01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:06.000]  testicles or within a foot or two of the body can lower sperm levels so much
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:10.520]  that conceiving could become difficult reports the telegraph the findings have
[01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:14.920]  led to leading British fertility experts to advise men to stop being addicted to
[01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:19.120]  mobile phones specialists found that sperm levels of men who kept their phones
[01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:23.520]  in their pockets during the day were seriously affected in 47% of cases
[01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:28.360]  compared to just 11% in the general population the team monitored more than
[01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:33.900]  100 men attending a fertility clinic for a year even keeping a phone on a bedside
[01:05:33.900 --> 01:05:39.000]  table appears to lower sperm counts the quality of sperm among men in Western

[01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:51.680]  if you haven't seen this video it's on info wars.com we posted it back to the
[01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:58.120]  front page we've added a Ben Garrison cartoon that shows him as Abe Lincoln
[01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:01.200]  throwing the Bill of Rights Constitution Declaration of Independence and
[01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:10.560]  we the people into a grave with Scalia and this is a big deal folks when you
[01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:15.040]  actually watch the video the body language is very Joker-esque like they're
[01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:18.120]  laughing about an enemy that's dead bare minimum they're making fun of a dead
[01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:23.080]  guy and and and and making light of it I mean this is a sick joke that was
[01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:28.360]  written for him on purpose to rub it in these people hate our guts so much they
[01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:32.240]  call us bitter clingers and I know Scalia is not perfect I wanted to ask
[01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:39.120]  college what they thought of what Obama did not well Scalia had some bad rulings
[01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:46.760]  well Kagan and Sotomayor and all these other people you want bad rulings baby
[01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:51.920]  you're gonna get them now so careful careful what you wish for that the
[01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:55.800]  grass is greener on the other side this Scalia was killing him on carbon taxes
[01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:59.480]  for trillions the gun control agenda that he was about to rule the open
[01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:04.840]  borders and support the Texas judges and you know this is the magic hour right
[01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:09.480]  when you'd expect the season of assassination boom and I'm not gonna
[01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:15.080]  even rehash all this he's been dead for eight days nine days eight days when
[01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:21.480]  Obama said this it's despicable let's play the club like me some of you might

[01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:33.120]  much done as possible for the folks that you represent fixing roads educating
[01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:41.520]  our children helping people retrain appointing judges the usual stuff
[01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:46.280]  because they're all in on it the members of Congress there are Democrats

[01:11:55.280 --> 01:12:05.280]  arrogance the evil in fact have a mad to it I want the full smiling when he's
[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:09.920]  talking when he starts telling the joke to the end it goes on it gets worse so
[01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:13.920]  Jacobson have Jacobson expand that I want to show Obama blown up his head on
[01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:20.280]  screen the entire time in slow motion I want him telling the joke in slow motion
[01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:27.440]  with his head blown up large I don't mean like Kennedy for one daughter said I
[01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:31.200]  meant actually get his head big on screen so folks can see up close the
[01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:37.640]  psychotic look I mean Obama could play the black American psycho he's got the
[01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:44.240]  body language if you study criminology and studied psychopaths that I can't
[01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:50.800]  stand even being anywhere close to look at him on screen Carl Rove has
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:54.240]  psychotic mannerisms I was in a restaurant once he came and sat down I
[01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:57.120]  had to leave and it was just because this is a guy that says he controls
[01:12:57.120 --> 01:13:01.840]  reality and you know his wrecked a Republican party and taking it over and
[01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:07.720]  it makes me want to throw up now they're gonna the last caller if you just
[01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:10.040]  join us I'm going back to your calls I'm gonna answer you shard his take on
[01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:14.520]  this who's sitting in here with us today Roger Stone who told us he would be
[01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:18.160]  calling the Fed last week and who told us you know that he'd be basically
[01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:21.160]  calling for Hillary to be indicted which he's now done I mean he's tripled
[01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:26.000]  down he's exposing 9-11 making Bush get out of the race or he keep bringing up
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:30.080]  the 28 pages within two days of him doing that Bush was gone our reporters
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:34.440]  were dogging him he they're scared folks because this will destroy the Clintons
[01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:38.800]  and the Bushes and this is what Trump had to do coming in out of Long Island
[01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:44.000]  into New York when only big mega banks and the mafia ran construction and he
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:49.000]  was able to go in there with celebrity and with panache and with charm but also
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:54.000]  with aggressive statements but he's also so charming that they just had to back
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:58.720]  off and leave him alone that's what he's doing now he's really smart like you
[01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:02.080]  know everybody knows she's guilty but I don't want to say that she's guilty just
[01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:06.360]  the way he does it it's so funny and and and we're sick of being talked down to
[01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:13.080]  we know he's talking down to them we love it and look if he was fake he would
[01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:17.240]  be the best liar I've ever seen and could be Satan I mean I'll say that
[01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:21.400]  because Obama screams evil screams arrogance with Trump it's not arrogance
[01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:26.960]  it's a it's a it's a big joke to him on them not caring what they say not
[01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:31.160]  caring what they do I don't want to say I have a lot in common Donald Trump but
[01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:36.160]  I'm not arrogant about the elite I wanted to know that they're scum they're
[01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:41.840]  trash they're deceitful they're liars and they mean nothing to me and Trump has
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:47.000]  that same view and he's proving over and over again he is the bona fide real
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:51.480]  McCoy and there's this talking point that they've got all this mafia dirt and as
[01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:55.680]  soon as he gets the nomination they're gonna destroy him well is that a
[01:14:55.680 --> 01:14:59.400]  self-fulfilling prophecy where they go oh you got a vote for Hillary or you're
[01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:02.680]  against women and women go well I better be for women you know it's you'll go to
[01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:06.720]  hell if you're a woman and don't vote for Hillary you're gonna condescending me
[01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:11.560]  I'm gonna have the Pope this Pope who says we should have open borders but he
[01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:14.560]  doesn't and then they have the New York Times say there's no wall around the
[01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:19.040]  Vatican they've got a square that comes in with walls and 50 foot steel doors I
[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:23.480]  was just there last year there's a special report coming out on that I put
[01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:27.920]  in the can Saturday I want to see that soon because that's important but in
[01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:31.600]  fact we guys go ask do I know he's doing the job eight people when that Vatican
[01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:35.680]  reports coming out because I want to show that and show the walls 200 plus foot
[01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:40.400]  walls and huge 50 foot steel doors but yeah you can come into the square there
[01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:44.360]  with the obelisk but there's walls it's just an opening so folks can go in and
[01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:47.720]  have the Pope stand up there from his palace actually your delusion on those
[01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:52.040]  walls don't exist the New York Times said I was full of baloney and of course
[01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:54.800]  Obamacare is free to folks if you like your doctor you can keep it you didn't
[01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:57.920]  build your business and raising the debt doesn't raise the debt but let's go to
[01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:06.440]  this clip of stone on CBS this is him commenting on CBS on Newsmax saying
[01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:11.120]  they're getting ready to come out with oh he built something with a guy 20 years
[01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:17.360]  ago and that guy later got indicted by that yardstick I've worked with hundreds
[01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:20.040]  of people and sometimes people get indicted for something and you're not
[01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:26.760]  involved what does it matter I mean this guilt by association and the Vatican
[01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:31.560]  Wall report will premiere on the nightly news tonight good can it just premiere
[01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:37.440]  here that issue great job dude that'll be tonight 7 o'clock central we'll have
[01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:39.880]  that then of course I'll be able to play it on the show tomorrow but let's go to
[01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:43.680]  this Roger Stone clip here it is the other thing you should be prepared for
[01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:48.960]  Steve is a major onslaught from CBS claiming that Donald Trump has ties to
[01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:53.560]  the mafia to the mob Donald Trump has been licensed by the New Jersey Casino
[01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:58.720]  Control Commission in the toughest gaming regulatory law in the country
[01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:03.280]  there's nothing to this canard has the kind of mayors that were used on Barry
[01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:07.480]  Goldwater by the way they didn't work they did work then they will not work
[01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:11.680]  has has CBS made this done this report yet or you know that it's in the in the
[01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:16.480]  pipeline I know that this is in the pipeline this has been kicking around for
[01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:21.560]  some time it is impossible for one to be in the construction business in New
[01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:28.400]  York and not come across those who are connected to organized crime but no one
[01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:35.040]  has ever successfully alleged that Trump has a real significant or genuine tie to
[01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:41.080]  the mafia this is a smear and again the proof is that the casino control
[01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:45.640]  regulators in New Jersey under the toughest statutes in the country have
[01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:49.880]  gone through Trump's finances and his business with a fine-tooth comb and he
[01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:54.280]  has been licensed and re-licensed and re-licensed right so this is the last
[01:17:54.280 --> 01:17:59.520]  dying gasp of the political establishment of those who are seeking to protect the
[01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:05.400]  established order I think all of this will come to not all right here's the
[01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:11.360]  deal the mafia has been kicked out of casinos since the 70s but in New York
[01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:16.440]  areas still has a lot of control and why is that because of Democrats and the
[01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:21.640]  unions that are basically the mafia but the public's been so dumbed down they
[01:18:21.640 --> 01:18:25.560]  also just think that only Italians are in organized crime and so that's something
[01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:29.360]  to Trump's advantage he's got a German last name the the public's gonna go he
[01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:33.320]  can't be in the mafia his name's Trump I mean that's how the bushes are the
[01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:38.400]  mafia the Clintons are the mafia does anyone have any idea that Al Capone was
[01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:42.800]  an Italian but he worked with the Dixie mafia that actually ran most the entire
[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:46.240]  country but see no one even knows there's a Dixie mafia because that's how
[01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:50.040]  dumb down the public is Anthony Gutiarty well obviously I'm a mobster with the
[01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:55.360]  last name Gutiarty as well to me it kind of reminds me of Hillary Clinton being
[01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:59.360]  let's say a bank robber right and she's in the bank and she comes out with sacks
[01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:03.440]  of money I mean she's got like millions of dollars get this right and she's
[01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:07.680]  running out with these sacks of cash and across the street is Trump right and
[01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:11.160]  he's just kind of walking down the street and she goes look at him caught
[01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:14.920]  red-handed he robbed the bank he's a criminal catch him right now and the
[01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:18.160]  police look at her and she's got those sacks of cash like gold dripping out of
[01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:21.960]  them and she's like get him they're like huh she is he stole that coffee in his
[01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:26.640]  hand yeah yeah somebody told me that 20 years ago he had some mobsters work
[01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:30.560]  pork poor concrete on one floor of a building right right exactly and you
[01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:33.400]  know who knows what's going on with Trump but what we can say is look what's
[01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:37.000]  going on with Hillary Clinton she has multiple indictments up against her she
[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:40.080]  has multiple things going on multiple investigations from I know how this
[01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:46.040]  works big business has been kicking the mafia out since the 70s I mean they
[01:19:46.040 --> 01:19:50.200]  don't let them anywhere near the casinos or boxing but you see the media is
[01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:54.000]  already winning because they're making us talk about it right so now the
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:57.480]  talking point has already been out there so now we have to talk about it when in
[01:19:57.480 --> 01:20:01.440]  reality the talking point should be look at Hillary Clinton what she's doing and
[01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:05.640]  look how we agree Trump should come out and he will the minute they pull this
[01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:08.960]  mafia crud weave another names and because it's been in the news a decade
[01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:13.280]  ago like oh a guy that once built part of a building for Trump was indicted
[01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:18.960]  wow you work with hundreds of thousands of people all over the world I mean he's
[01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:22.560]  got stuff in the Middle East he's got stuff in Europe I bet they can find a
[01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:26.280]  guy behind the counter that's dealing blackjack that's a crook I guess that's
[01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:29.400]  Donald Trump's fault well it's like if let's say there's Donald Trump have a
[01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:35.080]  criminal record no he doesn't and I'll go further this is what the Southern
[01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:38.400]  Poverty Law Center because we've learned it's these type of groups actually with
[01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:42.120]  these cutouts online as quote conspiracy theorists attack us this is the
[01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:47.920]  type of stuff they do to me they go Alex Jones's dad he was in business with
[01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:53.280]  George Herbert Walker Bush look his names David Jones of Houston it's a guy
[01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:57.920]  looks nothing like my dad he's not even a dentist but people still ask me is
[01:20:57.920 --> 01:21:01.360]  your dad friends with George Bush it's verifiable proof as if but then they
[01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:04.200]  ignore the story that my sister went to school his daughters went to the same
[01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:08.120]  private school I've eaten barbecue repeatedly with the governor I don't
[01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:11.560]  know how evil he be once he got another point is they play these guilt by
[01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:17.640]  association games what matters is what I do what I stand for what I say not who
[01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:20.520]  have I met or who have I talked to but another big lie is and I'll just address
[01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:27.760]  it because it's funny they go you know Alex is owned by ABC because like 15
[01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:34.280]  years ago the main satellite there was Jones there was a clear channel and
[01:21:34.280 --> 01:21:38.480]  there was ABC that I'm going to your calls folks and you had to go least
[01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:43.800]  time you know just like calling up AT&T and getting phone service if you have
[01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:48.840]  cable you work with AT&T if I have cable say you verse I am owned and run by by
[01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:52.520]  AT&T oh it's different you pay $4,000 a month for satellite feed for your show
[01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:56.480]  I mean this is the craziness but then when we switch to Jones they go oh my
[01:21:56.480 --> 01:22:02.640]  gosh he owns the Jones broadcasting company worth billions that no folks I'm
[01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:07.120]  not related to that Houston family I might actually be distantly but I don't
[01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:10.840]  think they've been to a family reunion about 50 years the the point is I mean I
[01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:13.680]  guess you could argue I was just related to the second president of the state of
[01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:17.320]  you want anyone with your last name you know I know anyone or you're Italian
[01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:21.240]  you're a mobster and my name is on completely but this is the mind games
[01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:25.200]  they play with a dumb down public where they sit there and they go well you know
[01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:31.200]  Alex Jones he's had CIA people on yeah whistleblowers exposing stuff thank God
[01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:34.160]  they're doing the right thing or you know Alex Jones has had people on that
[01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:38.040]  are in Delta Force and you know so you know but even though they're saying good
[01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:42.640]  things we just it's this idea and this is how they run it this is how they play
[01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:46.200]  games with people this is how they manipulate people this is how they
[01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:48.960]  brainwash him and this is what they're gonna do Trump no this is really really
[01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:52.120]  important and what people need to understand is why people do this why
[01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:55.520]  people attack you for because they can't address the issues well yeah because
[01:22:55.520 --> 01:22:58.360]  they want to discount everything you're saying so they want to invalidate you
[01:22:58.360 --> 01:23:01.240]  based on the silliest thing like right now someone watching this right now is
[01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:04.960]  gonna think I don't like the way Anthony speaks therefore I'm not listening to
[01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:07.920]  anything he says right I don't like the way he dresses or whatever people will
[01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:11.960]  use labels or anything they can to invalidate someone's entire existence
[01:23:11.960 --> 01:23:15.120]  just like with Trump for example they're gonna try and validate him and say he
[01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:17.360]  worked with someone from the quote-unquote mafia or whatever they're
[01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:20.920]  gonna try and invalidate you say you had someone from the former CIA on who was
[01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:24.000]  agreeing with you but they don't care they don't want to know they don't want
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.840]  to get it they want to invalidate you well the globalist should admit in their
[01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:30.080]  psychological warfare except it's from the Frank church committees with
[01:23:30.080 --> 01:23:33.800]  color tell pro they get into activist movements and make it all about holier
[01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:38.400]  than they are fighting with each other to make movements about disintegration and
[01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:43.600]  failure not hey we're patriots we love freedom we want lower taxes we're about
[01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:47.520]  father figures being strong female figures being strong we don't think we
[01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:51.480]  should ban the word mother and father this is a sick cult hey they admit they
[01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:56.320]  got cancer viruses the vaccines New York Times hey we were right there hey we
[01:23:56.320 --> 01:24:00.640]  want to take America back and restore the Republic and make America free and
[01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:06.080]  great and prosperous again not a a imperial holding of global corporations
[01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:10.120]  above the law that's what we stand for that's what we're doing and that's why
[01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:15.480]  info wars is successful I see this with cartoonist and Liberty lovers and
[01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:19.320]  writers and other talk show hosts people will send them fake emails saying I
[01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:22.720]  said something bad about them or saying they were diss somehow to have this
[01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:26.760]  weird association thing where oh we're in fighting and oh someone screwed you
[01:24:26.760 --> 01:24:30.960]  over I'm your friend when you hear that folks that was triggered by a government
[01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:36.200]  program the weak-minded person following that may not know it but all of this
[01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:39.600]  divide and conquer garbage is just that it's why they're funding black lives
[01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:42.960]  matter it's why they're trying to infiltrate militias and make them say
[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:47.640]  outrageous things these are tactics folks by this tiny elite that want to set
[01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:50.520]  each other's throats now I want to go to calls Anthony but getting back into
[01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:54.240]  Trump I don't see this working I don't see this being successful but we're
[01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:59.200]  countering it now before it comes out empowerment and everything that we
[01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:01.880]  stand for is threatening to people because it would mean that they have to
[01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:05.040]  change their ideology they've been given by the system and the establishment
[01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:07.880]  their entire lives that's why they're going to discount things and try to
[01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:11.120]  discount things that's why they're going to use smear campaigns and buy into
[01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:15.560]  it that's why the media is playing right into their choir because they want to
[01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:18.920]  not believe Trump they want to not believe you they want to not listen to
[01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:23.040]  us they want to just shut everything down and if the media spoon feeds them
[01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:26.960]  ideas to do that and reasons to do that that are totally insane and made up or
[01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:30.320]  whatever they will eat it sometimes a lot of them won't though and the media
[01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:34.160]  forgets that people have a brain the media forgets that the public actually
[01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:38.760]  has intelligent and what do you make of the fact that if the media attacked
[01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:42.480]  horsemen or people would endorse it now Trump's great but but the case of
[01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:46.760]  Sanders you know they're attacking him so people that are loving him even
[01:25:46.760 --> 01:25:49.720]  they're not intellectual or informed I mean I think there's already been a
[01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:54.280]  total revolution of awakening against the establishment they are the walking
[01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:58.920]  dead they are the zombie media and the zombie followers of that are getting
[01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:02.200]  smaller and smaller what is the system going to do because you already I think
[01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:05.200]  the media is totally pretending that they have power totally pretending they
[01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:08.680]  have push and pull facade time yes at the same time there is a weird
[01:26:08.680 --> 01:26:11.800]  narrative that people believe and it's us up up to us to stop believing their
[01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:14.480]  narrative because it doesn't mean it doesn't even matter at this point but
[01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:18.080]  yes they've lost their power they've lost their control they're kind of like
[01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:21.840]  Sauron weakening and he doesn't have any power the eye is withering right and
[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:25.160]  they want to pretend they do so they keep attacking and attacking but all it
[01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:28.720]  does is turn we've already taken out all the ring raves notice they do attack
[01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:32.000]  Bernie because he has anti-establishment in some ways right and they attack him
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.800]  and all it does is make people go to Bernie and hate Hillary so much I mean
[01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:38.760]  even Reddit like the alternative so-called left website that's super popular
[01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:43.600]  just hates Hillary Clinton I mean they and now she's having to openly steal
[01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:46.720]  the election in front of everybody winning six coin tosses to get the
[01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:52.560]  delegate 50-50 to push her over in Iowa losing by 20 points getting the
[01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:56.720]  delegates in New Hampshire obviously stealing the election big time in
[01:26:56.720 --> 01:27:02.040]  Nevada I mean it's just it's naked Anthony it's completely naked and that's
[01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:05.720]  the problem has never been connected to the mafia Hillary gets billions from
[01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:09.960]  foreign dictators and and gave weapons to al Qaeda and Benghazi okay so
[01:27:09.960 --> 01:27:15.600]  absolutely what does it matter what does it matter see she can say things like
[01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:20.200]  that she can say absurd things like that make absurd claims and not admit to
[01:27:20.200 --> 01:27:22.560]  never lying remember that interview when they say have you ever lied to the
[01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:25.520]  American public she goes well you know I would like to think that that's not the
[01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:31.040]  case have you ever lied I don't believe that I you know it's you can't answer
[01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:35.440]  the question of course he lies I did not have sex with that woman Monica
[01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:39.280]  whiskey he didn't have sex with that woman your conspiracy theorist actually
[01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:42.280]  then we're about to go to break I appreciate you coming in great job

[01:28:11.560 --> 01:28:15.560]  joint formula in Forrest Life.com joint formula you have to try it it has nine
[01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:20.000]  key ingredients turmeric root holy basil leaf it's called and consider it to be
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:24.200]  one of the most foundational herbs in Ayurvedic medicine which dates back to
[01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:29.760]  5000 BC turmeric one of the most studied herbs of all time 4580 studies on med
[01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:33.360]  line the National Library of Medicine we took all of the super high quality
[01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:36.840]  ingredients that I was taking others were taking the chemist put it all
[01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:40.880]  together for us and said look this is the supreme healthy these nine ingredients
[01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:45.160]  because we have the regular you know dose in there it's compacted is literally
[01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:49.840]  upwards of $60 to buy bottles of all of this with similar dosages this is all in
[01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:53.840]  one pill yeah I encourage you to look at it because truly comparable formulas in
[01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:59.200]  my view would be about 50 $60 and this is far less and it's always low price
[01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:03.560]  this is a limited first run as usual and this is powdered this is powdered in the

[01:38:39.200 --> 01:38:42.280]  year worldwide what do you think about Trump what do you think about him saying
[01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:45.160]  audit the Fed what do you think about him saying he'll call for criminal
[01:38:45.160 --> 01:38:48.920]  investigation basically indict Hillary if he gets elected what do you make of
[01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:53.480]  all this what's on your mind today with the Obama and the Scalia celebration
[01:38:53.480 --> 01:38:58.680]  well I tell you what the first thing I thought when they all by the way play
[01:38:58.680 --> 01:39:02.560]  and say that you know you're talking to a conspiracy theorist and of course you
[01:39:02.560 --> 01:39:06.760]  work for the CIA okay so let's just get that out of the way right off of the
[01:39:06.760 --> 01:39:12.840]  bat I've watched you for years this is my first time calling to you I'm I'm glad
[01:39:12.840 --> 01:39:18.720]  you're doing what you're doing wish we could do more if we just got to keep up
[01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:25.160]  the fight I'm gonna give you a little plug here I'm I am a vet
[01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:33.120]  Scalia is you know I mean what I watched that on TV and I'm like Scalia he just
[01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:36.840]  got back from Asia he just died the first thing hit my mind was the
[01:39:36.840 --> 01:39:41.560]  Russians by that got killed I'm like yeah they killed him okay
[01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:45.600]  Scalia didn't always rule the way I would have liked to rule but you know
[01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:48.760]  there's one thing in this country that we have to remember if we want to have a
[01:39:48.760 --> 01:39:53.000]  Constitution we have to let everybody else have a Constitution also so that
[01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:56.880]  means you know we're gonna get our feathers ruffled every now and then
[01:39:56.880 --> 01:40:01.920]  because it didn't go our way you know so right well Scalia wasn't perfect but
[01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:05.520]  he was appointed by Ronald Reagan who wasn't perfect but compared to what we
[01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:10.120]  got now was an angel and Scalia was helping say he ruled for the Second
[01:40:10.120 --> 01:40:13.480]  Amendment he was ruling for sovereignty was ruling to keep our power plants I
[01:40:13.480 --> 01:40:20.320]  mean Scalia was absolutely devastating the globalist oh yeah I have nothing bad
[01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:23.480]  to say about him I mean because you know I mean I don't get to get it my way
[01:40:23.480 --> 01:40:27.640]  all the time you know none of us do what do you think of the whole thing now
[01:40:27.640 --> 01:40:32.360]  with Obama laughing about it well I think it's a you know that's right along
[01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:38.920]  with him making his joke up there about he's got drones you know you know well
[01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:45.360]  you know I mean Obama was an easy pick you know I mean I told people when
[01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:49.920]  George Junior ran the first time I said man don't put that man in there
[01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:54.200]  cuz if you do we're going back to Iraq so he can finish what his daddy did
[01:40:54.200 --> 01:41:00.280]  cuz you know his daddy come right out there on there on on on TV talking
[01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:05.600]  about well yeah y'all stop this y'all call the new world order but we'll get
[01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:10.000]  done well you know I'm in skull and bones all of that you know what it is and
[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:15.000]  I do too then of course you know he got in there of course what I love was
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:21.520]  pulling Trump got on the debate so you know what all right didn't didn't bring
[01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:27.120]  the powers down I mean come on let's listen that was a basic truth admitted
[01:41:27.120 --> 01:41:32.000]  fact and it totally scared him to death what does your gut tell you about Trump
[01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:35.080]  I mean I'm really praying for him and I mean I really pray for him around the
[01:41:35.080 --> 01:41:41.280]  dinner table because he is going into the lion's den and he's the guy fighting
[01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:45.840]  them exposing them whether he's a good guy or not he's hurting them so you
[01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:50.640]  judge a tree by his fruits and Donald Trump's fruits are really good well I
[01:41:50.640 --> 01:41:55.600]  see what I'm gonna vote for him alright I'll just put that out there but because
[01:41:55.600 --> 01:41:59.920]  there's no way I would vote for the rest of the line and I'm not ready to live
[01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:03.240]  in a I mean we're already living in a socialistic country it's been
[01:42:03.240 --> 01:42:08.480]  socialistic just 1984 but and now we see the slide absolutely Carl God bless you

[01:42:47.280 --> 01:42:53.400]  like a lot of what he says and I'm not at all a Bernie lover or anything but I
[01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:57.440]  wanted to bring to your attention some of the stuff Mother Jones wrote a hit
[01:42:57.440 --> 01:43:02.120]  piece back in July of last year about him but some of the old papers he was
[01:43:02.120 --> 01:43:06.880]  writing back when he was one of the on the Freeman paper in New York or Vermont
[01:43:06.880 --> 01:43:10.040]  or wherever sure I've seen some of those articles what what are you specifically
[01:43:10.040 --> 01:43:15.840]  talking about well he said that fluoride causes cancer and authoritarianism
[01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:20.040]  causes cancer there's a there's an article it's called well that's why I
[01:43:20.040 --> 01:43:24.320]  don't like Bernie Sanders is I know he's smart I call him a dumb bum and all
[01:43:24.320 --> 01:43:28.800]  this he knows full well what's going on and he does a lot of good stuff he says
[01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:32.080]  a lot of good things I've got Bernie Sanders in the Obama deception a bunch
[01:43:32.080 --> 01:43:35.360]  and then he's sitting there telling people they're gonna get free education
[01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:39.440]  and all this free stuff you could take all the billionaires money and it wouldn't
[01:43:39.440 --> 01:43:43.480]  pay for anything for six months that I mean he's talk about getting rid of the
[01:43:43.480 --> 01:43:48.320]  derivatives you know look Donald Trump's talking about raising taxes on these
[01:43:48.320 --> 01:43:53.160]  tax exempt corporations that are based here but overseas that's what's gonna
[01:43:53.160 --> 01:43:56.640]  get this country going is cutting taxes on the poor people and the middle class
[01:43:56.640 --> 01:44:01.480]  and the new barish and and just telling multinationals people say he's in
[01:44:01.480 --> 01:44:04.960]  isolation as he's gonna have tariffs no he's saying you're going to have a very
[01:44:04.960 --> 01:44:11.480]  low 10% repatriation tax back into the United States so I mean these big
[01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:15.280]  corporations can pay 10% but no no they want us to pay it and then they get
[01:44:15.280 --> 01:44:21.600]  banker bailout money go ahead Sean 100% I'm not I'm not a defendant Bernie
[01:44:21.600 --> 01:44:25.920]  Sanders anyway I'm just saying sure well the mathematics just doesn't agree with
[01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:30.440]  it I get he's good on the NSA good on war good on the Federal Reserve oh but
[01:44:30.440 --> 01:44:34.240]  when he's the key vote that could audit it then he didn't vote for it oh but when
[01:44:34.240 --> 01:44:40.000]  his vote won't count and it's gonna fail he votes the guy right the guy is not as
[01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:44.360]  bad as Obama or Hillary and you know maybe it's good he's an open socialist
[01:44:44.360 --> 01:44:50.200]  and it's probably been counterproductive that I've called him a bunch of nasty
[01:44:50.200 --> 01:44:53.320]  names I apologize for that I understand that there's such a grassroots
[01:44:53.320 --> 01:44:56.720]  anger at the establishment that I don't even blame people wanting to go with a
[01:44:56.720 --> 01:44:59.800]  pure you know socialist I mean who knows anything can be better than where we're
[01:44:59.800 --> 01:45:05.640]  going but this is just crony capitalist robbing with the mega banks funding
[01:45:05.640 --> 01:45:09.800]  socialism to domesticate us and that's why they want socialism at the grassroots
[01:45:09.800 --> 01:45:17.520]  to make us dependent I'm raising any other points yes I was gonna say that
[01:45:17.520 --> 01:45:22.720]  it's just it's a revolutionary time right now do with the it is of course the
[01:45:22.720 --> 01:45:27.080]  uh the Bernie Sanders are delusional I'm not I'm not defending him in any way
[01:45:27.080 --> 01:45:30.240]  but I've seen there anything he kind of stole my point earlier when he was
[01:45:30.240 --> 01:45:33.020]  talking about Reddit and some of those if you look at some of those sites to
[01:45:33.020 --> 01:45:36.400]  bury in there the Bernie supporters are just fed up with Hillary and they're
[01:45:36.400 --> 01:45:39.920]  even saying I've seen a bunch of sites saying that brother I totally get it
[01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:46.760]  drudge had a pole that millions of people voted in and sure it's a free-for-all
[01:45:46.760 --> 01:45:50.880]  it's non-scientific but for me that's more scientific because everybody can
[01:45:50.880 --> 01:45:57.240]  just free-for-all vote I guess once for every Internet address or however it
[01:45:57.240 --> 01:46:04.360]  works and I wouldn't voted once and Trump had 37% and then next it was
[01:46:04.360 --> 01:46:10.920]  Sanders at 28% I'm going for memory and then last it was Hillary at 0.8 she
[01:46:10.920 --> 01:46:15.400]  doesn't have real supporters except weird cults of women who aren't about life
[01:46:15.400 --> 01:46:18.440]  or humanity they're all about I'm voting for her she's a woman because they're
[01:46:18.440 --> 01:46:25.360]  gang members that's all they are their group think and and I get the fact that
[01:46:25.360 --> 01:46:29.960]  Sanders is so popular and Hillary's having to rob him shows that even the
[01:46:29.960 --> 01:46:34.080]  Democrats are waking up and trying to go anti-establishment it's very positive
[01:46:34.080 --> 01:46:38.880]  that Bernie Sanders is doing so well with his constituents because it's seen
[01:46:38.880 --> 01:46:43.600]  as an anti-establishment vote the content of what he wants to do is a
[01:46:43.600 --> 01:46:48.920]  nightmare but it's all part of the huge awakening happening that's a counter to
[01:46:48.920 --> 01:46:53.920]  the globalist revolution against humanity the New World Order calls their
[01:46:53.920 --> 01:46:59.040]  operation I think was Bertrand Russell first did it the final revolution so did
[01:46:59.040 --> 01:47:05.320]  H.G. Wells who's a top Fabian socialist and futurist who wrote about atomic bombs
[01:47:05.320 --> 01:47:09.440]  in 1901 see a lot of advanced stuff they're not telling people about they
[01:47:09.440 --> 01:47:15.280]  have the equations then and this is how they map out and want to control the
[01:47:15.280 --> 01:47:20.200]  future and so the elite want socialism that's why I know it's bad
[01:47:20.200 --> 01:47:24.400]  Sean thank you for the call great points who's been holding the longest now
[01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:28.920]  Adam in the great state of Kentucky then we'll go to Terry Tommy Libby and
[01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:36.440]  others hello Alex yes sir go ahead I think this is my call the first time
[01:47:36.440 --> 01:47:44.360]  caller I was wanting to talk about us Scalia and you know you were asking
[01:47:44.360 --> 01:47:47.760]  about what we thought about Obama cracking jokes and things about it and
[01:47:47.760 --> 01:47:52.760]  you know I was it made me think when you have a group of people that have such
[01:47:52.760 --> 01:48:00.880]  low regard for the sanctity of life it's not surprising to me to see something
[01:48:00.880 --> 01:48:06.280]  like that such a ruthless group of people as the left and the progress is
[01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:10.120]  our if you study criminology and I want you to continue you're making a great
[01:48:10.120 --> 01:48:16.440]  point the criminals have to celebrate in public like a pack of jackals or rats or
[01:48:16.440 --> 01:48:21.360]  weasels or stoats and they need to do it in their weasel events and they need to
[01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:24.920]  brag about it and they need to relish it I'm gonna play the clip coming up in the
[01:48:24.920 --> 01:48:30.200]  next segment go ahead yes sir and and that's that's exactly what I thought when
[01:48:30.200 --> 01:48:34.560]  I saw that what was you know that's that's what we have become now that's the
[01:48:34.560 --> 01:48:39.920]  leadership that is at the top in this nation and the globalist which you speak
[01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:44.360]  of all the time and one of the biggest things that I respect about info or so
[01:48:44.360 --> 01:48:50.280]  much is that you guys actually look at history and see that the road we're
[01:48:50.280 --> 01:48:56.680]  going down is absolute craziness and it's designed it's designed yes and like
[01:48:56.680 --> 01:49:00.720]  the last call I was talking about you know Sanders it broke my heart as a
[01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:07.840]  young person in this nation to see that many people that are on this socialist
[01:49:07.840 --> 01:49:13.160]  bandwagon it is absolutely insane has no as nobody ever heard of they go
[01:49:13.160 --> 01:49:17.560]  healthcare is free in England it's some of the worst healthcare in the world
[01:49:17.560 --> 01:49:21.760]  everyone has to come here to get health care not that ours is perfect and they
[01:49:21.760 --> 01:49:27.000]  still go it's free they just they're the type of folks that buy lottery tickets and
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:30.120]  I'm not bashing you by lottery tickets but people that really think that's
[01:49:30.120 --> 01:49:35.880]  that's their business plan for life is a lottery ticket yeah and it is crazy it
[01:49:35.880 --> 01:49:40.040]  really is and and like I said as a young person to see that from so many other
[01:49:40.040 --> 01:49:44.720]  young people that just think that there is a free lunch and don't understand
[01:49:44.720 --> 01:49:49.200]  that there's nothing free in this world somebody's gonna be paying for that it's
[01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:53.080]  really sad I mean what are what are these kids being taught not only in their
[01:49:53.080 --> 01:49:56.960]  schools but by their parents I mean a whole generation of you absolutely listen
[01:49:56.960 --> 01:50:02.960]  I appreciate your call my father owned a dental office that employed three or
[01:50:02.960 --> 01:50:07.240]  four other dentists and a bunch of people that was popular and we were
[01:50:07.240 --> 01:50:15.880]  middle-class but by no means rich and my dad was a guy that loved the US
[01:50:15.880 --> 01:50:19.520]  government thought it was America thought we had the best system in the
[01:50:19.520 --> 01:50:29.200]  world and when the IRS called him in when they changed the tax laws when Bush was
[01:50:29.200 --> 01:50:35.040]  basically running the White House at the end of Reagan's term my dad came in
[01:50:35.040 --> 01:50:38.120]  with his receipts and everything the IRS and they said Mr. Jones we know you
[01:50:38.120 --> 01:50:42.240]  didn't shoot on your taxes we are organized crime we're gonna destroy you
[01:50:42.240 --> 01:50:44.600]  and your family if you don't give us your business everything you got and he
[01:50:44.600 --> 01:50:49.760]  said what she'd he had to have that moment

[01:54:59.080 --> 01:55:03.680]  man's a little blow the yards broke off they said that I got killed and when the
[01:55:03.680 --> 01:55:09.120]  yards broke off they said that I got killed but the adventure still lives on my
[01:55:09.120 --> 01:55:15.440]  friend and of course you got the late great Whelan Jennings right here I was
[01:55:15.440 --> 01:55:21.080]  a damn building across the river deep and wild we're stealing water didn't
[01:55:21.080 --> 01:55:27.240]  collide we're stealing water didn't collide a place called Boulder a place
[01:55:27.240 --> 01:55:32.960]  called Boulder on the wild you know I'm not gonna play the whole song but the
[01:55:32.960 --> 01:55:42.200]  next comes in Johnny Cash really well written song we can hear just the first
[01:55:42.200 --> 01:55:49.880]  part of cash I'll fly a Starship not of the globalists have their way won't be
[01:55:49.880 --> 01:55:54.880]  flying these Starships maybe I will rest my spirit when I reach the other side
[01:55:54.880 --> 01:56:00.320]  the arty not have been there before
[01:56:01.520 --> 01:56:07.640]  I'll fly a Starship they're trying to suppress humanity's old destiny when I
[01:56:07.640 --> 01:56:21.520]  reach the other side perhaps I will become a highway man again all right

[01:56:24.920 --> 01:56:31.000]  lives on forever and it's the genetics we pass on but also our spirit let's get
[01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:35.880]  to this slowed down clip because for radio listeners you really can't capture
[01:56:35.880 --> 01:56:40.920]  how evil Obama looks when he's making jokes and we're upping the audio too
[01:56:40.920 --> 01:56:46.160]  and boosting the jokes that they're saying back to him it's I believe I
[01:56:46.160 --> 01:56:49.080]  hear something very cryptic from some of the Congress folks this needs to be
[01:56:49.080 --> 01:56:52.200]  investigated but we're still looking into it boosting the audio we may have
[01:56:52.200 --> 01:56:56.600]  by the end of the next hour but this is Obama slowed down making a joke about
[01:56:56.600 --> 01:57:00.680]  appointing judges by that riskalius death and the congressional meeting of
[01:57:00.680 --> 01:57:10.120]  Democrats and press absolutely love it here it is like me some of you might be
[01:57:10.120 --> 01:57:18.600]  in the final year of your last term working as hard as you can to get as
[01:57:18.600 --> 01:57:29.280]  much done as possible for the folks that you represent fixing roads educating
[01:57:29.280 --> 01:57:42.000]  our children helping people retrain appointing judges the usual stuff
[01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:59.080]  look at that evil smile they are celebrating we're gonna play it again
[01:57:59.080 --> 01:58:02.960]  next hour at that end part try to make out what that person's saying but I
[01:58:02.960 --> 01:58:06.240]  hear something pretty sick from one of those Congress people or one of the age
[01:58:06.240 --> 01:58:11.280]  you can't tell cuz but I tell you we've got to just take that slowed down but
[01:58:11.280 --> 01:58:14.760]  unedited and post it under the video that's already on drugs so folks can see
[01:58:14.760 --> 01:58:20.840]  it slowed down for the full evil blown up and slowed down a picture tells a

[02:00:40.440 --> 02:00:44.480]  that I've seen and then they announced it like it's real but I haven't seen that
[02:00:44.480 --> 02:00:48.240]  happen in a while could this be a terror attack that got covered up we know they
[02:00:48.240 --> 02:00:52.360]  said as Sam Bernardino was workplace violence he's gonna pop in coming up at
[02:00:52.360 --> 02:00:55.960]  the start of the next segment and then I'm gonna burrow into the news I haven't
[02:00:55.960 --> 02:01:00.960]  gotten into yet and boy there is a lot of it militarily also what's happening in
[02:01:00.960 --> 02:01:06.160]  Democrat-controlled areas like Chicago with huge homicide explosion rate but
[02:01:06.160 --> 02:01:08.960]  right now let's go to Terry in Minnesota thanks for holding terrier on the
[02:01:08.960 --> 02:01:15.520]  year I'll get right into it I'm a new listener I've been listening about three
[02:01:15.520 --> 02:01:21.600]  weeks I've listened to Rush and Hannity and and back on these guys for years and
[02:01:21.600 --> 02:01:26.120]  I gotta tell you within the first hour basically because I'm looking for truth
[02:01:26.120 --> 02:01:30.720]  they're listening to you guys I knew I was on to something here and when I
[02:01:30.720 --> 02:01:35.320]  heard back this morning talking about the unification of the talk radio show
[02:01:35.320 --> 02:01:40.880]  host on the right these guys should be taking lessons from you guys because you
[02:01:40.880 --> 02:01:46.720]  guys really you're out there I mean out there people are starving and looking for
[02:01:46.720 --> 02:01:51.880]  truth absolutely and that's why your show is gaining and gaining and gaining
[02:01:51.880 --> 02:01:57.320]  and again I'm just saying this it's just fantastic have you folks out there well
[02:01:57.320 --> 02:02:02.200]  I don't in fight but when I am attacked I have to defend myself if I think it
[02:02:02.200 --> 02:02:08.400]  rises to that level Glenn Beck was a liberal talk show host and he basically
[02:02:08.400 --> 02:02:11.840]  took my show and I've talked to people that worked in his operation high level
[02:02:11.840 --> 02:02:18.640]  and created kind of a neocon version of it which is it's fine but then he wanted
[02:02:18.640 --> 02:02:22.480]  to get rid of the real Alex Jones and so I've had stations that they've said you
[02:02:22.480 --> 02:02:26.080]  know don't carry Alex Jones you can't have our show and I've had him talk about
[02:02:26.080 --> 02:02:30.280]  me and say horrible lies about me and then now he wants to run when he was at
[02:02:30.280 --> 02:02:33.840]  Fox News he tried to boss everybody around he tried to say he was in control
[02:02:33.840 --> 02:02:38.400]  I've talked to some of the biggest names and talk radio who are nice people but
[02:02:38.400 --> 02:02:43.080]  are on short leashes and that are being threatened and they say Beck literally
[02:02:43.080 --> 02:02:46.720]  thinks he's God he thinks he's Christ that's why he's talking about running to
[02:02:46.720 --> 02:02:50.080]  Israel and being like a cult leader I mean next it'll be you know the hellbop
[02:02:50.080 --> 02:02:54.520]  stuff for I'm serious you know where the black Nike tennis shoes and I'm not
[02:02:54.520 --> 02:02:57.960]  being mean the guy it's even in mainstream news he's like a cult leader
[02:02:57.960 --> 02:03:02.680]  we're not running a cult here you know if somebody gives Glenn Beck the wrong
[02:03:02.680 --> 02:03:06.440]  pin in his office he reportedly blows up I've had that from I mean I got people
[02:03:06.440 --> 02:03:09.880]  around here that have been on Beck's show been around him and I just wish the
[02:03:09.880 --> 02:03:15.640]  guy well I wish he'd come to reality but yeah you've mainline conservative talk
[02:03:15.640 --> 02:03:19.240]  show host wanted to save the country they would look at what we're covering
[02:03:19.240 --> 02:03:23.560]  what we're doing and a lot of them have gone that direction nori on his own
[02:03:23.560 --> 02:03:27.920]  because he's a smart guy has taken that show from all UFOs only 20% UFOs
[02:03:27.920 --> 02:03:33.360]  we're influencing the ex files to get you know into more serious topics I'll
[02:03:33.360 --> 02:03:37.920]  talk about that coming up pretty good episode last night and we are having an
[02:03:37.920 --> 02:03:42.320]  effect but it's just because we're outside the box and they aren't Michael
[02:03:42.320 --> 02:03:46.560]  Savage is just as smart as we are smarter he doesn't need to listen to us
[02:03:46.560 --> 02:03:50.400]  know what's going on he gets it so I think really if you want to get down to
[02:03:50.400 --> 02:03:55.120]  who's truly willing to talk about the full spectrum it's this show and Michael
[02:03:55.120 --> 02:04:00.080]  Savage and then that's it on a big national scale and and we're limited
[02:04:00.080 --> 02:04:03.040]  like a hundred and seventy affiliates which sounds big but the compared to
[02:04:03.040 --> 02:04:06.280]  limbaugh 600 we are on terrestrial radio and it's great people we reach a lot of
[02:04:06.280 --> 02:04:10.200]  folks a lot of them are small stations we do dominate on the internet we're
[02:04:10.200 --> 02:04:14.280]  bigger than limbaugh and Beck and all of them combined when it comes to the
[02:04:14.280 --> 02:04:18.760]  internet and we're growing exponentially and you know Matt Drudge has talked about
[02:04:18.760 --> 02:04:22.760]  the fact that he has a choice to listen to rush Limbaugh Alex Jones and you know
[02:04:22.760 --> 02:04:25.520]  he circles to me I guess six seven eight years ago and he listened for one
[02:04:25.520 --> 02:04:29.240]  week and made the switch to Alex Jones but I'm not in competition with rush
[02:04:29.240 --> 02:04:32.560]  Limbaugh I wish there was somebody much better than me that could wake everybody
[02:04:32.560 --> 02:04:37.520]  up and and it could also take all the heat because this is a war here I mean
[02:04:37.520 --> 02:04:40.360]  when I'm doing this dead serious Terry I don't want to cut you short stay there

[02:04:59.800 --> 02:05:03.600]  having a mobile phone close to the testicles or within a foot or two of
[02:05:03.600 --> 02:05:07.960]  the body can lower sperm levels so much that conceiving could become difficult
[02:05:07.960 --> 02:05:12.440]  reports the telegraph the findings have led to leading British fertility experts
[02:05:12.440 --> 02:05:16.920]  to advise men to stop being addicted to mobile phones specialists found that
[02:05:16.920 --> 02:05:20.240]  sperm levels of men who kept their phones in their pockets during the day
[02:05:20.240 --> 02:05:25.800]  were seriously affected in 47% of cases compared to just 11% in the general
[02:05:25.800 --> 02:05:31.080]  population the team monitored more than 100 men attending a fertility clinic for
[02:05:31.080 --> 02:05:36.040]  a year even keeping a phone on a bedside table appears to lower sperm counts
[02:05:36.040 --> 02:05:41.240]  the quality of sperm among men in Western countries is constantly decreasing by

[02:08:01.680 --> 02:08:07.280]  history and I can document how that is the case American journalist Adam Media
[02:08:07.280 --> 02:08:11.760]  that have criticized the U.S. administration over transparency issues
[02:08:11.760 --> 02:08:16.960]  we cover what we are allowed to cover lack of transparency the huge political
[02:08:16.960 --> 02:08:21.400]  advantage information management has become so sophisticated every
[02:08:21.400 --> 02:08:26.120]  administration learns from the previous I've got a parent and I've got a fault
[02:08:26.120 --> 02:08:29.880]  there are actions I have the legal authority to take as president what do
[02:08:29.880 --> 02:08:34.080]  you say to someone who believes the president took action to change the law
[02:08:34.080 --> 02:08:37.800]  we did not change the law we acted within the law what they're not paying
[02:08:37.800 --> 02:08:44.760]  attention to is the fact that I just took an action to change the law
[02:08:44.760 --> 02:09:04.440]  they're all about breaking the law breaking the Constitution
[02:09:04.440 --> 02:09:15.000]  from the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones
[02:09:19.520 --> 02:09:22.760]  and that's what it's all about we're gonna continue with your phone calls
[02:09:22.760 --> 02:09:26.640]  throughout the hour at a ton of news and clips we haven't gotten to yet if you
[02:09:26.640 --> 02:09:31.200]  just joined us Donald Trump came out yesterday as Trump insider Friday said
[02:09:31.200 --> 02:09:35.600]  he would do and called for auditing the private run-for-profit foreign owned
[02:09:35.600 --> 02:09:42.200]  predominantly Federal Reserve he also said that he would basically indict and
[02:09:42.200 --> 02:09:45.440]  have a criminal investigation of Hillary Clinton effect let me just go to drudge
[02:09:45.440 --> 02:09:51.080]  and give you the exact headline I'll prosecute Hillary as president close
[02:09:51.080 --> 02:09:59.520]  quote that's Washington examiner that is a big big big deal now Joe Biggs is
[02:09:59.520 --> 02:10:04.400]  investigating something that is only in the local news so far and we're going to
[02:10:04.400 --> 02:10:08.960]  be talking about this with him here in just a moment but the reason we're
[02:10:08.960 --> 02:10:13.640]  looking at this is they said San Bernardino was not a terror attack it
[02:10:13.640 --> 02:10:18.720]  turned out the FBI was ordered to keep saying that the shooting the bombs all
[02:10:18.720 --> 02:10:24.240]  of it we know there have been a bunch of attacks at military bases and at Army
[02:10:24.240 --> 02:10:29.120]  Navy Marine Corps Air Force recruiting centers we know that Americans have been
[02:10:29.120 --> 02:10:32.440]  targeted overseas as well we know that there have been a bunch of attacks in
[02:10:32.440 --> 02:10:38.480]  France where it would say theater attacked and other shootings and killings
[02:10:38.480 --> 02:10:42.200]  but it wouldn't even hardly be on the news just me and six other events or nine
[02:10:42.200 --> 02:10:45.760]  other events so they're very good with these Islamists is coming in to cover up
[02:10:45.760 --> 02:10:50.600]  the rapes to cover up the attacks now in my experience sometimes the feds do
[02:10:50.600 --> 02:10:54.600]  urban warfare drills and will detonate what they claim as a pipe bomb but it's
[02:10:54.600 --> 02:10:59.360]  a simulant like the US Embassy in other countries they do this too and then
[02:10:59.360 --> 02:11:02.520]  they'll say later the British Embassy got caught in the US throwing a flash
[02:11:02.520 --> 02:11:05.120]  bang up against its own window and blowing it out and that was because
[02:11:05.120 --> 02:11:09.200]  people inside felt like they didn't have enough security so sometimes security
[02:11:09.200 --> 02:11:13.600]  agencies do this to draw attention or to get funding and they don't talk about
[02:11:13.600 --> 02:11:20.000]  it but more often than not I've been told by pretty high-level people that
[02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:23.840]  there have been chemical plants hit some of these explosions you hear about at
[02:11:23.840 --> 02:11:30.840]  factories are sabotage and when there's real sabotage you end up not seeing it
[02:11:30.840 --> 02:11:34.840]  in the news there are terror attacks that they sweep under the rug when
[02:11:34.840 --> 02:11:40.680]  there's a big scripted one and they've got an agenda ready you see them with
[02:11:40.680 --> 02:11:44.360]  scripting within minutes they've already got their spin you know when it's a
[02:11:44.360 --> 02:11:51.240]  staged event but when it's not a staged event they will sweep it out of the rug
[02:11:51.240 --> 02:11:57.840]  and in the old days in the 60s and 70s the communist bombed hundreds of
[02:11:57.840 --> 02:12:02.080]  libraries and government buildings and police stations and killed people and
[02:12:02.080 --> 02:12:06.560]  blinded them and blew them and their families up in cars it's kind of a
[02:12:06.560 --> 02:12:09.200]  black lives matter thing but it was communist the folks that put Obama in
[02:12:09.200 --> 02:12:13.520]  they're really Ford Foundation operatives and other type groups but
[02:12:13.520 --> 02:12:18.600]  communisms there cover the weathermen and people and they would hardly report
[02:12:18.600 --> 02:12:21.920]  those at the time because they don't want to give attention to the groups who
[02:12:21.920 --> 02:12:26.520]  were trying to form a larger uprising and to get people around the nation to
[02:12:26.520 --> 02:12:30.320]  burn their neighborhoods so they've tried this communist overthrow garbage
[02:12:30.320 --> 02:12:35.280]  before now looking at this I don't know if it's a drill I don't think it's a
[02:12:35.280 --> 02:12:42.040]  weatherman operation that was in the 70s and 60s it fits the MO Abu Jihadi event
[02:12:42.040 --> 02:12:49.240]  in this area is chopped full of little islamo birds little little little mini
[02:12:49.240 --> 02:12:53.200]  al-qaeda bases and we've sent Joe Beggs around the country to obviously cover
[02:12:53.200 --> 02:12:57.040]  that we have some of that b-roll we can show for TV viewers but Joe tell us
[02:12:57.040 --> 02:13:03.040]  where this is what's happening nobody is covering this except local news and to
[02:13:03.040 --> 02:13:06.720]  their credit Lenbeck's covering it's a good job when back that's one thing when
[02:13:06.720 --> 02:13:10.520]  when Beck's been really right about is the caliphate the Islamic invasion and
[02:13:10.520 --> 02:13:14.040]  Obama you know financing all this and all that I heard that stuff like eight
[02:13:14.040 --> 02:13:17.320]  nine years ago and couldn't believe it when he was running but I mean now it's
[02:13:17.320 --> 02:13:21.080]  really true in fact Joe before you do this like a story let me ask you as a
[02:13:21.080 --> 02:13:24.360]  combat vet of Afghanistan in Iraq and somebody's been working here for two
[02:13:24.360 --> 02:13:28.040]  three years and somebody that was doing journalism before that you know went to
[02:13:28.040 --> 02:13:32.920]  college for it after you out of the military what do you think Obama is
[02:13:32.920 --> 02:13:39.120]  really doing who is he CIA parents Ford Foundation connections but then weird
[02:13:39.120 --> 02:13:45.440]  Indonesian you know tranny nannies and and then Ford Foundation and all this
[02:13:45.440 --> 02:13:49.720]  weird stuff and then speaking perfect Arabic in Cairo and his first big speech
[02:13:49.720 --> 02:13:53.440]  it for president they said was like an imam was speaking and then his family and
[02:13:53.440 --> 02:13:58.960]  in Kenya at least cousins and people running operations with the Muslim
[02:13:58.960 --> 02:14:04.200]  Brotherhood and then backing al-qaeda and ISIS and now ISIS has got missiles
[02:14:04.200 --> 02:14:07.720]  stinger missiles that's in the news we told people years ago that's coming I
[02:14:07.720 --> 02:14:11.360]  mean this is crazy what do you think the in-game in is here and who is Obama
[02:14:11.360 --> 02:14:15.920]  really Joe I think President Obama is the real-life version of Sergeant Brody
[02:14:15.920 --> 02:14:20.120]  from homeland I think he is a Muslim infiltrator into our government he's
[02:14:20.120 --> 02:14:23.320]  playing the part right now but he's secretly doing stuff behind the scenes
[02:14:23.320 --> 02:14:26.200]  a lot of that stuff's come to the forefront thanks you know what we've
[02:14:26.200 --> 02:14:29.200]  done here to info wars in other places I have to say he acts like a Saudi
[02:14:29.200 --> 02:14:34.000]  operative let's show a video of him bowing to the king of Saudi Arabia yeah
[02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:38.600]  I mean it's extremely interesting to see how we can see all of this stuff we
[02:14:38.600 --> 02:14:42.520]  can see what he's doing he's arming ISIS he's backing them up he's demonizing
[02:14:42.520 --> 02:14:48.000]  people who want to say no to Islamist you know radicalization and then
[02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:51.760]  demonizing them and then trying to take their rights away the fact that freedom
[02:14:51.760 --> 02:14:55.800]  of speech is being taken away in America the fact that if you criticize
[02:14:55.800 --> 02:15:00.880]  radical Islamization of any kind then you are gonna have your Facebook shut
[02:15:00.880 --> 02:15:04.240]  down your Twitter account that's why I'm doubling down going up against it I'm
[02:15:04.240 --> 02:15:10.120]  not gonna be censored I mean I don't know why someone could get into that
[02:15:10.120 --> 02:15:14.400]  position get past so many people and trick so many people that's how you know
[02:15:14.400 --> 02:15:19.840]  that there is a bigger entity behind all of this that there's another power
[02:15:19.840 --> 02:15:23.880]  behind this wanting this to happen they want America to be destabilized they
[02:15:23.880 --> 02:15:27.600]  wanted to shut down and they want usher in this whole new world order it's crazy
[02:15:27.600 --> 02:15:31.560]  to see someone like this come in and completely destroy what America stands
[02:15:31.560 --> 02:15:36.040]  notice he doesn't bow to British royalty or Japanese royalty I don't think he
[02:15:36.040 --> 02:15:42.280]  should he bows though to the waist to the Saudis the most despicable dirt bag
[02:15:42.280 --> 02:15:45.180]  government and now we have Hillary Clinton she's at the forefront of the
[02:15:45.180 --> 02:15:49.440]  Democrat Party right now and she dresses what like a communist she wears
[02:15:49.440 --> 02:15:57.400]  literal 1960 era Mao Zedong wife dresses the actual same dresses yellow gray the
[02:15:57.400 --> 02:16:02.440]  same dresses silk remade what is the message I mean you know bow into the
[02:16:02.440 --> 02:16:07.640]  Saudis launching jihad she's in mal outfits I can't even believe what trash
[02:16:07.640 --> 02:16:11.280]  these people are I mean I'd be surprised if you know Trump comes in and he
[02:16:11.280 --> 02:16:15.520]  released those 28 pages we see some kind of connection with Obama somehow I know
[02:16:15.520 --> 02:16:18.120]  you've been on the fence on Trump and I haven't talked to you since Trump came
[02:16:18.120 --> 02:16:21.680]  out and said audit the Fed investigate 9-11 he'll expose the bushes Hill and
[02:16:21.680 --> 02:16:25.720]  died Hillary I mean I know you're right yes I'd say 60 40 you know 60% for I
[02:16:25.720 --> 02:16:28.800]  mean correct me if I'm wrong nights coming over to Trump now I mean come on
[02:16:28.800 --> 02:16:31.520]  to give me your honest opinion well now that he's coming out and said that if
[02:16:31.520 --> 02:16:35.560]  he becomes president he's gonna take Hillary Clinton and put her where she
[02:16:35.560 --> 02:16:38.800]  needs to be in jail I'm all about it anyone who's gonna stand up and go
[02:16:38.800 --> 02:16:42.840]  against Hillary Clinton you've got my vote I can't stand that woman she's the
[02:16:42.840 --> 02:16:47.120]  most evil person in the world and anybody who's willing to stand up
[02:16:47.120 --> 02:16:52.200]  especially come in get that nomination become president and put her in jail
[02:16:52.200 --> 02:16:58.760]  I'm all for it what do you make of the bizarre laughing and smiling that Obama
[02:16:58.760 --> 02:17:03.160]  engaged in slow-mo it's really scary and we're trying to isolate and turn up
[02:17:03.160 --> 02:17:07.640]  that what the Congress people this is a Congress meeting are saying but it
[02:17:07.640 --> 02:17:10.600]  sounds like they're just having a celebration about Scalia's death very
[02:17:10.600 --> 02:17:15.320]  sick I mean like we said we we've we've after investigation you can see that
[02:17:15.320 --> 02:17:20.240]  there's something behind this it looks like that something has been playing
[02:17:20.240 --> 02:17:25.960]  this isn't just a natural cause you know you've got a man John point Dexter who's
[02:17:25.960 --> 02:17:30.680]  a donor to the Obama administration he's been awarded by him this guy gets
[02:17:30.680 --> 02:17:34.440]  flown out there he doesn't have his secret service is a security team so to
[02:17:34.440 --> 02:17:37.120]  say federal marshal you know federal marshals or whatever he doesn't have
[02:17:37.120 --> 02:17:41.840]  that he's flown in this area there's no autopsy no autopsy head and it flushes
[02:17:41.840 --> 02:17:46.320]  you know his remains he has a flu is down the drain in El Paso that's such
[02:17:46.320 --> 02:17:50.120]  ridiculous so we should question that and then when you when President Obama
[02:17:50.120 --> 02:17:53.800]  comes out and says something about it and laughs that's like a spit in our face
[02:17:53.800 --> 02:17:58.920]  like the fellow on the head look a broxy sleeps with the fishes yeah I mean I
[02:17:58.920 --> 02:18:03.320]  don't understand why more people aren't upset and how so many people can back
[02:18:03.320 --> 02:18:07.400]  this man when he is blatantly coming out and showing that he has a complete and
[02:18:07.400 --> 02:18:11.520]  total disregard for human life this is the same guy who won the Pulitzer prize
[02:18:11.520 --> 02:18:15.960]  right after droning tons of people I mean they didn't give him a book award I
[02:18:15.960 --> 02:18:23.560]  think it was the Nobel Prize but that's the great part about it now I think we
[02:18:23.560 --> 02:18:27.440]  should give him Nobel Prize for every village he innocently bombs that's the
[02:18:27.440 --> 02:18:31.880]  other thing they bombed the villages it's come out to stir up the jihadis to
[02:18:31.880 --> 02:18:35.440]  get more recruits yeah that's exactly what that's this attack that's how
[02:18:35.440 --> 02:18:41.160]  sophisticated these globalist are that's a tactic yeah it's unbelievable it's
[02:18:41.160 --> 02:18:44.240]  like a reverse false flag against us now now tell us about this latest event
[02:18:44.240 --> 02:18:47.640]  all right so right now there is a Kanawha County that's in West Virginia now
[02:18:47.640 --> 02:18:51.360]  let's go back before what you said earlier that there was an explosion that
[02:18:51.360 --> 02:18:55.160]  went off in Kanawha now ISIS in West Virginia America's fusion centers report

[02:24:31.400 --> 02:24:36.880]  listeners out across the country but that ties into Saudi's foreign minister
[02:24:36.880 --> 02:24:40.840]  calls for arming Syrian jihadists with anti-aircraft missiles to shoot down
[02:24:40.840 --> 02:24:45.840]  Russian airplanes what do you think Benghazi was I mean that's on record so
[02:24:45.840 --> 02:24:49.680]  this whole civil war is escalating and they've got sleeper cells now they
[02:24:49.680 --> 02:24:53.760]  admit all over the US and Europe they activate them they start attacking and
[02:24:53.760 --> 02:24:58.480]  the government will take our rights bags and put checkpoints up for us I mean
[02:24:58.480 --> 02:25:02.760]  they've really got this all figured out yes ridiculous so the local KCHS TV in
[02:25:02.760 --> 02:25:07.160]  that Kenawa County in West Virginia is reporting that the IED went off the
[02:25:07.160 --> 02:25:11.160]  local bomb squads went out they reviewed over the situation said it's an IED and
[02:25:11.160 --> 02:25:14.720]  the police are not making any comments on the situation at this time but here's
[02:25:14.720 --> 02:25:17.680]  the thing you go back you look at the history these cells that have been
[02:25:17.680 --> 02:25:21.840]  cell spotted there are people looking into it doing investigations to ice and
[02:25:21.840 --> 02:25:26.120]  sleeper cells in that area so this could be a trial run they use something like
[02:25:26.120 --> 02:25:30.280]  this he's a smaller detonation some that's not gonna cause a lot of harm to
[02:25:30.280 --> 02:25:34.080]  see how these ambulances fire department bomb squad will come in so they
[02:25:34.080 --> 02:25:37.320]  could shoot them up no well what they do is a they want to see how they set up
[02:25:37.320 --> 02:25:40.120]  and they got more bombs and they plan right where they're gonna that's the
[02:25:40.120 --> 02:25:45.440]  worst yes so in combat you know exactly like they they come to one event and
[02:25:45.440 --> 02:25:48.360]  they know where the helicopters would land and blow those up yep it's called
[02:25:48.360 --> 02:25:52.600]  a secondary device your secondary device is usually your most dangerous ones to
[02:25:52.600 --> 02:25:56.480]  worry about so I have something smaller to bring in everyone and they'll use a
[02:25:56.480 --> 02:25:59.720]  you know something like this right now to measure they'll sit back far off take
[02:25:59.720 --> 02:26:02.920]  notes kind of write up a little grid on a piece of paper oh that's why you're so
[02:26:02.920 --> 02:26:06.000]  concerned I wasn't thinking about that so what I'm thinking is this could be a
[02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:09.400]  trial run they do this to see how it's gonna happen and they use that to see how
[02:26:09.400 --> 02:26:12.800]  these guys in an area will respond the next time it could be something bad
[02:26:12.800 --> 02:26:16.720]  because we know that there is ISIS in that area it's already been reported
[02:26:16.720 --> 02:26:19.880]  before that's what I'm worried about is another small device going off they
[02:26:19.880 --> 02:26:23.400]  bringing these people and then this time they'll actually be secondary devices
[02:26:23.400 --> 02:26:26.560]  because you have to understand a lot of these bomb squad events might not have
[02:26:26.560 --> 02:26:30.680]  served overseas in comment had to work necessarily with these secondary devices
[02:26:30.680 --> 02:26:34.760]  and had to really combat or go up against these Islamist extremists who
[02:26:34.760 --> 02:26:38.240]  work in theater over in Iraq and Afghanistan who use those kind of
[02:26:38.240 --> 02:26:42.240]  tactics so that's where my concern is the fact that this could be real the fact
[02:26:42.240 --> 02:26:46.080]  this could be a real situation well my cousin told me about a story he was there
[02:26:46.080 --> 02:26:53.920]  and he was supporting a bunch of SF people and this five-year-old kid had
[02:26:53.920 --> 02:26:58.200]  been burned with gasoline and they were going out there and they said wait a
[02:26:58.200 --> 02:27:01.240]  minute hold back wait a minute they turn out when they got there the dad was
[02:27:01.240 --> 02:27:05.640]  there with a bunch of bombs but they were in they were able to get him and have
[02:27:05.640 --> 02:27:09.800]  him not detonate and then you know try to save the kid but he'd burned his own
[02:27:09.800 --> 02:27:14.160]  son just to lure them in yeah I mean look at it not normally for torture but
[02:27:14.160 --> 02:27:17.840]  that guy didn't end up well he didn't end up surviving I'll leave it at that I
[02:27:17.840 --> 02:27:21.240]  mean looking back dad when they were going into the palaces and stuff going
[02:27:21.240 --> 02:27:26.880]  after Saddam they saw that his guys saw that Saddam had all these pictures and
[02:27:26.880 --> 02:27:29.840]  posters up on the walls and the soldiers were going in and ripping them off the
[02:27:29.840 --> 02:27:32.680]  ground so a lot of these guys found out that this was going so they started
[02:27:32.680 --> 02:27:35.480]  putting explosives behind the pictures and when soldiers would go in and rip
[02:27:35.480 --> 02:27:39.080]  that stuff off it would blow them up so it's another tactic they use they want
[02:27:39.080 --> 02:27:41.900]  to see what people do they want to see how you're gonna respond and then the
[02:27:41.900 --> 02:27:45.000]  next time it's harder that's like in the Pacific in World War two they'd leave
[02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:48.440]  a samurai sword out but when you pulled it out it had a cord going to the ground
[02:27:48.440 --> 02:27:51.200]  with explosives or two they would shoot someone in the sniper would shoot
[02:27:51.200 --> 02:27:54.000]  somebody in the knee wound a guy what would happen your medic team would come
[02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:57.400]  out then the sniper would get those guys and then more guys would go and more
[02:27:57.400 --> 02:28:00.600]  guys would go and they would get shot and shot and shot it's that's what I'm
[02:28:00.600 --> 02:28:03.920]  worried about and the fact that this could be real this could blow the lid on
[02:28:03.920 --> 02:28:07.280]  Obama's well I wasn't even thinking about that because you're like this is
[02:28:07.280 --> 02:28:11.240]  important this could be real okay but but now I get it the headline we should
[02:28:11.240 --> 02:28:14.040]  you should do a special report on this and where I'm not here interrupting
[02:28:14.040 --> 02:28:17.960]  because you're the expert on this laying out could this be a setup for a larger
[02:28:17.960 --> 02:28:22.080]  event for a secondary advice a device explain that to everybody you know in a
[02:28:22.080 --> 02:28:27.000]  focused way because that makes a lot of sense and the fact that they're not
[02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:30.160]  making a bigger deal out of it really makes me wonder yeah that's what I'm
[02:28:30.160 --> 02:28:33.600]  most worried about is the fact that they might have some intel that could kind of
[02:28:33.600 --> 02:28:36.440]  go in you know they're gonna take this information run it up the train and
[02:28:36.440 --> 02:28:39.840]  you know the White House they'll be coming back and send them letters going
[02:28:39.840 --> 02:28:43.920]  hey man you might not want to say anything about this keep this on the
[02:28:43.920 --> 02:28:46.880]  hush hush because we've already got a lot of people upset about the borders
[02:28:46.880 --> 02:28:50.200]  being open the fact that you know Americans are being harassed by the TSA
[02:28:50.200 --> 02:28:53.360]  meanwhile these guys get to come in they get a vote they get drivers license they
[02:28:53.360 --> 02:28:57.120]  can go through checkpoints they don't get harassed well that's my question how
[02:28:57.120 --> 02:29:01.360]  is Obama bringing these people in gonna get away with more San Bernardino's and
[02:29:01.360 --> 02:29:05.040]  more major Hassan events which they didn't call terror either how are they
[02:29:05.040 --> 02:29:08.800]  gonna get to it where they take our rights but they're flying plain loads of
[02:29:08.800 --> 02:29:12.720]  illegals in every day not even checking their passport I mean people say be nice
[02:29:12.720 --> 02:29:16.560]  the illegals okay then don't check mine then yeah I don't want to be treated
[02:29:16.560 --> 02:29:20.320]  like this when I'm a citizen I'm tired of being discriminated against Joe yeah
[02:29:20.320 --> 02:29:23.480]  it's ridiculous well it just shows the whole things there to take our freedoms
[02:29:23.480 --> 02:29:27.080]  and and whether he's doing it you know because he is a jihadi or because it's
[02:29:27.080 --> 02:29:30.600]  part of some master plan doesn't matter Obama is a jihadi collaborator against
[02:29:30.600 --> 02:29:33.960]  this country and so is the Democratic Party and I just can't believe they're
[02:29:33.960 --> 02:29:37.160]  that big a sacks of crap but they don't even want wealth and power folks they
[02:29:37.160 --> 02:29:42.920]  want to destroy America and destroy Christians they are satanic it's a
[02:29:42.920 --> 02:29:47.880]  takeover they want to hurt us they are enemies they hate us we'll be back thank
[02:29:47.880 --> 02:29:51.680]  you we're on the March the Empire's on the right call for straight ahead folks
[02:29:51.680 --> 02:29:56.320]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[02:29:57.680 --> 02:30:03.520]  in addition to threatening to invade Syria and al-Bashar al-Assad Saudi
[02:30:03.520 --> 02:30:08.080]  Arabia says it wants to arm jihadist in the country with anti-aircraft missiles
[02:30:08.080 --> 02:30:12.640]  to take out Russian jets we believe that introducing surface to air missiles in
[02:30:12.640 --> 02:30:16.640]  Syria is going to change the balance of power on the ground said the Saudi
[02:30:16.640 --> 02:30:21.000]  Foreign Minister he continued it will allow the moderate opposition to be
[02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:25.200]  able to neutralize the helicopters and aircraft that are dropping chemicals and
[02:30:25.200 --> 02:30:28.480]  have been carpet bombing them just like the surface to air missiles in
[02:30:28.480 --> 02:30:32.600]  Afghanistan were able to change the balance of power there this has to be
[02:30:32.600 --> 02:30:36.800]  studied very carefully however because you don't want such weaponry to fall
[02:30:36.800 --> 02:30:41.400]  into the wrong hands even the New York Times admits there are few if any
[02:30:41.400 --> 02:30:46.120]  moderate rebels fighting in Syria despite this reality Secretary of State
[02:30:46.120 --> 02:30:50.160]  John Kerry and British Prime Minister David Cameron continue to insist there
[02:30:50.160 --> 02:30:57.840]  are moderates fighting against Assad you can find more reports on info wars.com

[02:32:11.520 --> 02:32:16.680]  ago when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs they had
[02:32:16.680 --> 02:32:22.160]  drums of their own air raid sirens but in the 21st century there are silent
[02:32:22.160 --> 02:32:27.120]  weapons for quiet war pathogens added to the food and water into the lining of
[02:32:27.120 --> 02:32:32.000]  plastics that destroy our vitality turn off our hormones and accelerate our

[02:33:42.440 --> 02:33:46.280]  I've got to get to this other news folks it's incredible I haven't played the
[02:33:46.280 --> 02:33:50.080]  video yet it's on info wars comm of
[02:33:50.080 --> 02:33:53.680]  MSNBC cutting over the town hall which they hadn't been doing during the town
[02:33:53.680 --> 02:33:58.600]  hall when Bernie Sanders started talking about TPP and a globalist takeover of
[02:33:58.600 --> 02:34:02.560]  America and then we've got Hillary coming out now this is coming up if I
[02:34:02.560 --> 02:34:07.600]  don't get to it this hour David Knight will Hillary says sexist NASA destroyed
[02:34:07.600 --> 02:34:15.600]  her astronaut aspirations folks one in a million at the start of the astronaut
[02:34:15.600 --> 02:34:23.720]  program could do this I've looked it up her eyesight wasn't good enough and you
[02:34:23.720 --> 02:34:26.760]  didn't send women back then to something where you blew up on rockets a third of
[02:34:26.760 --> 02:34:31.200]  the time or died because people couldn't stand seeing a woman die just like men
[02:34:31.200 --> 02:34:35.160]  can have babies well men don't like to send women to die and I would just love
[02:34:35.160 --> 02:34:37.440]  to I mean there are women that can be great astronauts there are women that
[02:34:37.440 --> 02:34:44.560]  are up there in that top one tenth of one percent but Hillary ain't it so talk
[02:34:44.560 --> 02:34:48.040]  about playing the sexist card that waddling creature I like to know what
[02:34:48.040 --> 02:34:52.680]  you a little goggle-eyed chicken neck to hippie let's pull up Hillary Clinton in
[02:34:52.680 --> 02:34:57.400]  college I mean you talk about you talk about it just she looks like she
[02:34:57.400 --> 02:35:04.000]  couldn't carry a sack of groceries up a fly to stairs these are scales of
[02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:09.880]  things folks like they have superhuman people that are in more elite special
[02:35:09.880 --> 02:35:13.880]  forces units that actually have like double chromosomes and stuff the
[02:35:13.880 --> 02:35:18.200]  Olympics is unable to ban it but a lot of folks have that it doesn't matter if
[02:35:18.200 --> 02:35:21.440]  I've been in fights where I've taken on two three 200 plus pound guys that know
[02:35:21.440 --> 02:35:24.840]  how to fight and I got mad enough that I was able to beat them you get in fights
[02:35:24.840 --> 02:35:30.040]  with people that have extra chromosomes and stuff you can't beat them and it's
[02:35:30.040 --> 02:35:36.280]  the same thing with with with astronauts the level they're screened at
[02:35:36.280 --> 02:35:41.000]  they're basically superhuman they're the best of the best of the best of the
[02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:46.720]  best they were combat vets basically all of them from World War two and Korea
[02:35:46.720 --> 02:35:51.720]  and they had the highest IQ's and the most stamina I could sit there while
[02:35:51.720 --> 02:35:54.880]  air was going out of the capsule and they're gonna die in 10 minutes and not
[02:35:54.880 --> 02:36:01.880]  panic and then let's look at a picture Hillary Clinton she wants to be a
[02:36:01.880 --> 02:36:09.720]  Superman lady you're nothing okay I couldn't be an astronaut you sure can't

[02:36:49.720 --> 02:36:54.000]  murdered with I called my crew here on Saturday and said something big is
[02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:56.560]  about to happen in the morning I said I don't know what it is I was freaking out

[02:37:12.320 --> 02:37:17.280]  really helped me in my personal life as far as for since 9-11 I've been awake
[02:37:17.280 --> 02:37:22.160]  and people who have looked at me like I'm crazy because of the political views
[02:37:22.160 --> 02:37:25.840]  I have did that steal your deal when Trump said there's 28 pages and we
[02:37:25.840 --> 02:37:29.680]  attacked the wrong country and the Bush has covered it up that shows the boldness

[02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:39.240]  starting to change I'm watching it happen in front of me and it's amazing I
[02:37:39.240 --> 02:37:43.680]  mean there's no other way to put it because people would not listen to
[02:37:43.680 --> 02:37:48.240]  anything about corrupt government they just didn't want to hear it you know
[02:37:48.240 --> 02:37:53.160]  it's automatic conspiracy theory the cognitive dissidents is over Matt Drudge

[02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:48.640]  Richard there in just a second ma'am what is your main point on all of this
[02:39:48.640 --> 02:39:54.720]  today with Scalia I think that when you watch the video as soon as he begins to
[02:39:54.720 --> 02:39:59.160]  tell about that he has an agenda that he's got to complete and that he's got
[02:39:59.160 --> 02:40:04.320]  to serve his masters essentially that you can see the smile on his face as the
[02:40:04.320 --> 02:40:10.160]  words escape his lips there's really no question about the level of evil that
[02:40:10.160 --> 02:40:14.440]  we're dealing with and I want to say very quickly because I know you're your
[02:40:14.440 --> 02:40:20.560]  press for time God bless you and your crew for what you do you glorify God
[02:40:20.560 --> 02:40:25.800]  every day oh you're a sweetheart ma'am please don't break down and cry you're
[02:40:25.800 --> 02:40:30.600]  a sweetheart I'm grateful for an opportunity to speak to you and I have to
[02:40:30.600 --> 02:40:35.600]  tell you that there are so many people that are not awake yet and you know some
[02:40:35.600 --> 02:40:40.960]  of us live in fear for our children for our family for our way of life we're
[02:40:40.960 --> 02:40:48.840]  literally depending on every word that you give us to give us hope I every day
[02:40:48.840 --> 02:40:54.960]  is warfare every day for a man on the face of the earth is warfare Job 7 1 well
[02:40:54.960 --> 02:40:59.560]  ma'am I hear you and and look evil wants to take over to run our lives for
[02:40:59.560 --> 02:41:03.520]  control because it craves it and you're right to be concerned you're right to
[02:41:03.520 --> 02:41:06.760]  have tears in your eyes because what's happening is epic the evil the selling
[02:41:06.760 --> 02:41:11.400]  of baby parts the cancer viruses and the vaccines all of it is epic I really
[02:41:11.400 --> 02:41:14.560]  appreciate you joining us ma'am we've got about 30 seconds left was there
[02:41:14.560 --> 02:41:17.760]  anything else you wanted to add because you you said you were calling in about
[02:41:17.760 --> 02:41:23.200]  Scalia well like I said I think it's very obvious when you watch the clip from
[02:41:23.200 --> 02:41:29.640]  from the conference that there's no question that he is mocking and there
[02:41:29.640 --> 02:41:33.960]  was no question the minute I heard the Scalia had died I knew in my art of
[02:41:33.960 --> 02:41:39.920]  hearts that he'd been murdered and I'm very very frightened for our military I
[02:41:39.920 --> 02:41:42.520]  think that I understand that most of them are awake at this point and they
[02:41:42.520 --> 02:41:48.480]  know what's happening but I think it's phenomenally unconscionable to expect
[02:41:48.480 --> 02:41:52.760]  our military to turn against their friends their families you know their
[02:41:52.760 --> 02:41:59.040]  brothers in arms when all of this goes down well this is a nasty totalitarian
[02:41:59.040 --> 02:42:03.000]  takeover and I hear you God bless you ma'am really great points now I'll get to
[02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:06.360]  Rob and I'll get to Mike and I'll get to Glenn that'll be it for calls I think
[02:42:06.360 --> 02:42:09.320]  David nice to take some calls as well but I'm gonna take those three calls
[02:42:09.320 --> 02:42:12.680]  after Richard leaves us and I'm gonna get into some of the news we've mentioned
[02:42:12.680 --> 02:42:17.840]  but not covered in detail yet Richard Reeves is in Nevada for the caucus that
[02:42:17.840 --> 02:42:22.800]  happens today and they're saying Trump is neck and neck with Rubio and all the
[02:42:22.800 --> 02:42:27.960]  rest is I mean I'm watching different channels and there is literal worship of
[02:42:27.960 --> 02:42:32.200]  Rubio and this talking point that if you go with Trump as soon as he gets the
[02:42:32.200 --> 02:42:35.280]  nomination the media is gonna destroy him they've already tried to destroy him
[02:42:35.280 --> 02:42:39.320]  Richard I specifically want you to speak to that point what the numbers are
[02:42:39.320 --> 02:42:42.240]  you're seeing on the ground there and other observations then I want to ask
[02:42:42.240 --> 02:42:47.040]  you about Scalia and and have you seen the footage of Obama at a congressional
[02:42:47.040 --> 02:42:50.600]  press conference with members of Congress making fun and you know a big
[02:42:50.600 --> 02:42:56.440]  joke and having a devilish smile on his face when he laughs about Scalia well
[02:42:56.440 --> 02:43:00.240]  Alex we are here in Las Vegas at the beautiful Trump International Hotel if
[02:43:00.240 --> 02:43:03.040]  you come visit Las Vegas I highly recommend you stay here it's beautiful
[02:43:03.040 --> 02:43:07.560]  now about those numbers about what you're asking about Trump versus Rubio
[02:43:07.560 --> 02:43:12.280]  versus the media etc yes the media is not waiting for Donald Trump to be
[02:43:12.280 --> 02:43:17.720]  nominated the media is going on full-on attack against Donald Trump yesterday
[02:43:17.720 --> 02:43:23.920]  the week last week last month last year they are on full onslaught attack do not
[02:43:23.920 --> 02:43:27.880]  expect that to let up anytime soon in the meantime watch for Donald Trump to
[02:43:27.880 --> 02:43:33.280]  keep fighting yesterday we were able to attend a taping with Sean Hannity which
[02:43:33.280 --> 02:43:38.680]  by the way Sean Hannity is doing the best job on Fox he is the closest one to
[02:43:38.680 --> 02:43:43.400]  our point of view and in fact I heard him say during a break that his show was
[02:43:43.400 --> 02:43:47.720]  number one three nights last week so more power Sean Hannity doing a great
[02:43:47.720 --> 02:43:50.720]  I was about to say because the words come out from Murdoch and it's come out
[02:43:50.720 --> 02:43:56.560]  the Roger L's emails destroy Trump destroy him and so he's bucking I mean
[02:43:56.560 --> 02:43:59.880]  his job is probably in danger just because he's not attacking Trump I mean
[02:43:59.880 --> 02:44:04.640]  the talking points on Fox are sickening why does Fox think they can get away I
[02:44:04.640 --> 02:44:08.320]  mean I know Rupert Murdoch wants Hillary to get in but do you think Fox
[02:44:08.320 --> 02:44:12.200]  viewers are gonna put up with us no they're not gonna put up with it they're
[02:44:12.200 --> 02:44:15.440]  gonna make Sean Hannity number one as long as he keeps doing the job that he's
[02:44:15.440 --> 02:44:19.320]  doing as long as he keeps being a constitutionalist and a patriot so more
[02:44:19.320 --> 02:44:24.000]  power to Sean Hannity doing a fantastic job and you know the Megan Kelly's the
[02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:28.920]  Bill O'Reilly's they're gonna go down so a fox is in a rocking hard spot because
[02:44:28.920 --> 02:44:33.240]  I think if they do fire Sean Hannity be the biggest mistake Fox ever ever made I
[02:44:33.240 --> 02:44:37.640]  think the audience would absolutely have a conniption fit now earlier you had that
[02:44:37.640 --> 02:44:42.800]  liner talking about Obama's transparent administration yes he has got the most
[02:44:42.800 --> 02:44:46.440]  transparent administration when it comes to being unconstitutional he's got the
[02:44:46.440 --> 02:44:50.360]  most transparent administration when it comes to being jihadi there's no doubt
[02:44:50.360 --> 02:44:55.640]  about that so I tell you what the issue about I didn't get to see the clip where
[02:44:55.640 --> 02:44:59.840]  Obama's making that joke but I heard you playing it earlier absolutely disgusting
[02:44:59.840 --> 02:45:05.360]  I don't think America that's why that's why he's got no chance of putting he's
[02:45:05.360 --> 02:45:09.000]  got no chance of putting in a new justice on the Supreme Court because he's
[02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:13.200]  damaged his relationship with the hundred members of the US Congress so
[02:45:13.200 --> 02:45:18.840]  badly is the US Senate so badly that yeah okay he could probably put up Judge
[02:45:18.840 --> 02:45:23.440]  Napolitano that might be the one guy Judge Andrew Napolitano that the Senate
[02:45:23.440 --> 02:45:27.480]  would go ahead and accept and anybody else it's like forget it you know so
[02:45:27.480 --> 02:45:32.640]  yes it's just you know we got war upon war upon war we got the Obama
[02:45:32.640 --> 02:45:36.120]  administration fighting against Trump we got Hillary fighting against Trump the
[02:45:36.120 --> 02:45:40.320]  media it's like I said yesterday Trump is like King Kong on the Empire State
[02:45:40.320 --> 02:45:43.560]  Building and he's got multiple planes coming at him from the New World Order
[02:45:43.560 --> 02:45:47.600]  look look he's come out and said all at the Fed he's come out and said 28 pages
[02:45:47.600 --> 02:45:51.320]  9-11 he's come out and said he didn't die Hillary have elected he is really
[02:45:51.320 --> 02:45:58.160]  punching the dragon in the nose you know like he's literally Prince George or
[02:45:58.160 --> 02:46:02.600]  something taking on the dragon or whoever he was in mythology I mean this is
[02:46:02.600 --> 02:46:06.040]  getting insane now what are you seeing on the ground what are the other key
[02:46:06.040 --> 02:46:09.560]  points with the caucuses coming up what are the real numbers looking like what
[02:46:09.560 --> 02:46:13.240]  do you expect Trump to do Richard you called it last time I expect Donald
[02:46:13.240 --> 02:46:16.680]  Trump to have a huge victory had seven or eight thousand people it was the
[02:46:16.680 --> 02:46:21.440]  biggest political gathering in Nevada history Nevada history biggest
[02:46:21.440 --> 02:46:25.040]  political gathering in Nevada history last night down here in southern Las
[02:46:25.040 --> 02:46:29.560]  Vegas Marco Rubio I think it's gonna be third Marco Rubio is evidently expecting
[02:46:29.560 --> 02:46:33.920]  a pretty bad result today because he did an event here in Las Vegas this morning
[02:46:33.920 --> 02:46:38.000]  but immediately he could not leave the venue fast enough we tried to ask him
[02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:42.600]  about his political correctness attitude and character he blasted out of that
[02:46:42.600 --> 02:46:46.720]  venue like a scalded cat on his way to Minnesota for an event this afternoon
[02:46:46.720 --> 02:46:50.920]  and ultimately to Michigan this evening and let me unveil right now let me
[02:46:50.920 --> 02:46:54.720]  switch topics real quick and unveil Donald Trump secret weapon that really
[02:46:54.720 --> 02:46:58.240]  hasn't been talked about yet we've touched upon it here on the campaign
[02:46:58.240 --> 02:47:02.440]  trail but here's a secret weapon Alex this is a quote from the richest man in
[02:47:02.440 --> 02:47:07.440]  Babylon from the forward one sentence our prosperity as a nation depends on the
[02:47:07.440 --> 02:47:12.000]  personal financial prosperity of each of us as individuals that's Donald Trump's
[02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:15.280]  secret weapon because not only is he going to be the greatest jobs president
[02:47:15.280 --> 02:47:19.160]  ever he's going to be the greatest small businessmen's friend he's going to be
[02:47:19.160 --> 02:47:23.800]  the greatest middle-sized businessmen's friends he is going to put on this is
[02:47:23.800 --> 02:47:27.360]  fundamental let me just stop you for a minute because you know we're breaking
[02:47:27.360 --> 02:47:31.360]  down things here it's not that Trump's perfect but it's fundamental he wants
[02:47:31.360 --> 02:47:36.040]  prosperity he likes wealth he likes people doing well he gets a rising tide
[02:47:36.040 --> 02:47:41.280]  raises all ships to quote JFK or Henry Ford wanting to pay his people enough to
[02:47:41.280 --> 02:47:46.600]  buy his cars and other appliances the globalist the the UN crowd openly want
[02:47:46.600 --> 02:47:49.600]  us poor they openly don't want us to have cars or air conditioning they
[02:47:49.600 --> 02:47:54.200]  openly want us to be peasants and so it's fundamental he is in he is a
[02:47:54.200 --> 02:47:59.240]  nationalist who is for wealth and for a wealthy nation and that's that's what's
[02:47:59.240 --> 02:48:02.560]  happening so so because they're saying the polls are neck and neck you're saying
[02:48:02.560 --> 02:48:05.960]  you're on the ground I agree that I think Trump's be the real winner here's the
[02:48:05.960 --> 02:48:09.680]  problem they admit even the mainstream news that Nevada has some of the worst
[02:48:09.680 --> 02:48:16.320]  Republican hanky-panky even worse than Iowa with the Democrats even worse not
[02:48:16.320 --> 02:48:20.000]  just the last election but the election before that where there was clear fraud
[02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:25.240]  going on so what are we doing to watch that Richard Alex potentially that is
[02:48:25.240 --> 02:48:29.680]  the case but fortunately it's the info warriors it's you and so many other
[02:48:29.680 --> 02:48:35.000]  patrons that have worked for years to get us to this moment in 2008 yes the
[02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:38.240]  establishment was able to pull all kinds of hanky-panky here in the Nevada
[02:48:38.240 --> 02:48:42.960]  caucuses against the Patriots but they came back in 2012 they did a little bit
[02:48:42.960 --> 02:48:47.480]  better they still had hanky-panky but I think now those numbers of patriots are
[02:48:47.480 --> 02:48:51.200]  going to be coming out in caucusing for Trump are going to be so overwhelming
[02:48:51.200 --> 02:48:54.480]  that the establishment powers are going to they're just not going to have the
[02:48:54.480 --> 02:48:58.720]  numbers necessary to pull off the hanky-panky so I don't think that's going
[02:48:58.720 --> 02:49:02.040]  to be a factor I think we're going to see Don Trump have a big victory tonight
[02:49:02.040 --> 02:49:07.080]  Ted Cruz will be number two Marco Rubio despite all the establishment forces
[02:49:07.080 --> 02:49:11.280]  rallying their horses I mean they've got the governor Sandoval here in Nevada
[02:49:11.280 --> 02:49:15.520]  has endorsed him so you know what thank you very much New World Order thank you
[02:49:15.520 --> 02:49:18.920]  very much establishment GOP because you're creating the list every
[02:49:18.920 --> 02:49:22.800]  endorsement that Marco Rubio gets that's the people that we need to vote against
[02:49:22.800 --> 02:49:26.840]  absolutely and there's also a kid Daniels article on prisonplanet.com and
[02:49:26.840 --> 02:49:31.400]  info wars.com that the new big poll outside of it poll most the Jeb Bush
[02:49:31.400 --> 02:49:36.040]  supporters are going over to Trump now show yeah and that is excellent news and
[02:49:36.040 --> 02:49:39.960]  I'll tell you what talking about other other candidates talking about people
[02:49:39.960 --> 02:49:45.320]  coming in we met a guy last night Alex Eddie Hamilton Eddie Hamilton running
[02:49:45.320 --> 02:49:51.040]  for the US Senate here in Nevada as a Republican Donald Trumpian he's a
[02:49:51.040 --> 02:49:56.000]  Trumpian 100% through and through Alex I tell you what I can't wait to see five
[02:49:56.000 --> 02:50:01.200]  to ten new US senators that are patriots I can't wait to see that to me that's the
[02:50:01.200 --> 02:50:04.800]  most exciting you know don't party that's a good political correctness that's
[02:50:04.800 --> 02:50:10.560]  pro family pro male pro freedom pro wealth and bring back humanity I mean
[02:50:10.560 --> 02:50:14.120]  it's not being intimidated by these sickening social engineers that rolled

[02:54:30.680 --> 02:54:35.640]  obesity mental problems that manipulate chemicals in the brain and I remember
[02:54:35.640 --> 02:54:40.360]  reading 15 16 years ago talking to Dr. Nick Baggich and others about patents for
[02:54:40.360 --> 02:54:44.680]  information over power lines but also through the lights where the you're in
[02:54:44.680 --> 02:54:47.920]  where data is transferred over power line this is old technology and then
[02:54:47.920 --> 02:54:51.280]  through lights with the flicker rate that's picked up by your computer your
[02:54:51.280 --> 02:54:56.840]  iPhone whatever they also said it was an associated press article also said we're

[02:55:02.440 --> 02:55:08.320]  it with a flicker rate so fast they that they can't even see it consciously can
[02:55:08.320 --> 02:55:11.560]  they just hide total mind control in plain view and they had a bunch of news
[02:55:11.560 --> 02:55:15.040]  articles over the years going he's insane he claims that there's data over
[02:55:15.040 --> 02:55:20.680]  your light bulbs and that they can control your mind yeah like the Pokemon

[02:55:25.080 --> 02:55:31.440]  here it is AFP French news agency they'll probably have a White House run
[02:55:31.440 --> 02:55:34.480]  publication about tomorrow and say I'm insane they won't show where I showed
[02:55:34.480 --> 02:55:38.160]  this I'll just say doesn't exist just like you know there's no tyranny either

[02:55:57.360 --> 02:56:03.520]  how this is the future being held in Barcelona now that means even though
[02:56:03.520 --> 02:56:07.760]  when you turn your computer off this can then give covert orders to it and turn
[02:56:07.760 --> 02:56:11.800]  it on just like I told you more than a decade ago that most computers have
[02:56:11.800 --> 02:56:15.360]  capacitors in the chips where they can even if your computer is hooked into
[02:56:15.360 --> 02:56:19.600]  the internet they can passively turn your computer on with that chip or put
[02:56:19.600 --> 02:56:22.400]  information on the chip that when it turns on the Trojan to control your
[02:56:22.400 --> 02:56:26.400]  computer they're building the control grid into everything and then making you
[02:56:26.400 --> 02:56:30.800]  pay for it in the cost of the cars and an appliances and products you get so

[03:03:50.080 --> 03:03:55.760]  Hillary is exposing 9-11 as an inside job what more could you ask did you ever
[03:03:55.760 --> 03:04:01.600]  think you'd hear truth from an American leader ever again in your life and not a
[03:04:01.600 --> 03:04:08.800]  King Kong Richard but William Wallace just make sure he doesn't go to to the
[03:04:08.800 --> 03:04:15.120]  meeting with the Bruce absolutely Trump knows his risk in his life he just he
[03:04:15.120 --> 03:04:18.960]  wants to be a real man he wants to save America he hates these globalists I mean
[03:04:18.960 --> 03:04:23.600]  it's clear I don't or he's super evil and wants power and wants to push them
[03:04:23.600 --> 03:04:27.240]  aside and if he gets in and starts double-crossing folks you know we'll have
[03:04:27.240 --> 03:04:32.080]  to expose him obviously and will be very very sad what does your gut tell you
[03:04:32.080 --> 03:04:38.600]  Glenn my gut tells me that he's gonna be the president if he survives and I'm
[03:04:38.600 --> 03:04:45.480]  extremely worried that that could be in question you're right brother yeah I'm
[03:04:45.480 --> 03:04:50.400]  really worried about Donald Trump I'm worried about us all but I have similar
[03:04:50.400 --> 03:04:54.000]  experiences to Trump so I can imagine what's going on his head David Knight's
[03:04:54.000 --> 03:04:59.480]  coming up in this chair stay with us back in three minutes a new study shows
[03:04:59.480 --> 03:05:03.600]  that having a mobile phone close to the testicles or within a foot or two of the
[03:05:03.600 --> 03:05:07.880]  body can lower sperm levels so much that conceiving could become difficult
[03:05:07.880 --> 03:05:12.400]  reports the telegraph the findings have led to leading British fertility experts
[03:05:12.400 --> 03:05:16.840]  to advise men to stop being addicted to mobile phones specialists found that
[03:05:16.840 --> 03:05:20.200]  sperm levels of men who kept their phones in their pockets during the day
[03:05:20.200 --> 03:05:25.760]  were seriously affected in 47% of cases compared to just 11% in the general
[03:05:25.760 --> 03:05:31.040]  population the team monitored more than 100 men attending a fertility clinic for
[03:05:31.040 --> 03:05:35.480]  a year even keeping a phone on a bedside table appears to lower sperm

[03:08:33.800 --> 03:08:38.960]  going to talk about Sheldon Adelson the guy who's been the sugar daddy to people
[03:08:38.960 --> 03:08:44.920]  who declare unwavering loyalty to Israel and of course he had a lot to do with
[03:08:44.920 --> 03:08:50.200]  the shenanigans involving the Nevada caucus four years ago before we get to
[03:08:50.200 --> 03:08:55.160]  politics before we talk about Nevada, Las Vegas I want to tell you about an
[03:08:55.160 --> 03:08:58.720]  interview that I had last night of the nightly news was Sheriff Mack we've
[03:08:58.720 --> 03:09:02.680]  reported we just have had a report that came out the beginning of this week it's
[03:09:02.680 --> 03:09:05.960]  still up at the top of info wars.com about how the Department of Justice is
[03:09:05.960 --> 03:09:09.640]  moving using the Southern Poverty Law Center narrative as they've been doing
[03:09:09.640 --> 03:09:13.960]  over and over again but again expanding the net going after people who
[03:09:13.960 --> 03:09:17.720]  criticize the government accusing them of being extremists and terrorists. We've
[03:09:17.720 --> 03:09:21.680]  seen this with Clavin Bundy and I have an article up as well as that video on
[03:09:21.680 --> 03:09:27.120]  info wars.com constitutional sheriff has been targeted by the feds Hillary
[03:09:27.120 --> 03:09:32.360]  however is still free because they targeted him forget this a security
[03:09:32.360 --> 03:09:36.840]  leak a security leak and this of course revolves around the events that happened
[03:09:36.840 --> 03:09:41.480]  with the Oregon standoff but there is a much longer history with this sheriff
[03:09:41.480 --> 03:09:46.040]  with the federal government than just what happened in the Oregon standoff we
[03:09:46.040 --> 03:09:50.640]  talked about that in the interview I mentioned it briefly in the article but
[03:09:50.640 --> 03:09:55.080]  also haven't talked about the federal criminal complaint against Clavin Bundy
[03:09:55.080 --> 03:10:00.720]  it is a pile of lies and conspiracies from the federal government I can tell
[03:10:00.720 --> 03:10:04.520]  you with someone who was there as an eyewitness someone who was reporting
[03:10:04.520 --> 03:10:08.680]  someone who was broadcasting what happened there we were there at the
[03:10:08.680 --> 03:10:12.120]  standoff there wasn't any mainstream media essentially left at that point
[03:10:12.120 --> 03:10:14.880]  they'd all been given the clue early in the morning that the sheriff was going
[03:10:14.880 --> 03:10:18.000]  to show up and tell Clavin he could have his cattle back or have his have his
[03:10:18.000 --> 03:10:23.040]  range back and so CNN and Fox News and the people who had been there basically
[03:10:23.040 --> 03:10:26.840]  pulled out there was one Fox News cameraman who remained but the large
[03:10:26.840 --> 03:10:32.360]  media presidents had had had left at that point and that was when the standoff
[03:10:32.360 --> 03:10:35.800]  occurred but when we look at the federal complaint here's what they accuse
[03:10:35.800 --> 03:10:41.120]  Clavin Bundy of they said he used dangerous and deadly weapon to forcibly
[03:10:41.120 --> 03:10:45.520]  assault resist oppose and peed intimidate interfere with federal law
[03:10:45.520 --> 03:10:49.480]  enforcement officers while guarding and protecting governor a government
[03:10:49.480 --> 03:10:54.240]  personnel and equipment located at the impoundment site at or near Bunkerville
[03:10:54.240 --> 03:10:59.640]  Nevada now I can tell you I was there we broadcasted we have the recordings
[03:10:59.640 --> 03:11:05.720]  Clavin Bundy was not even at the standoff Clavin Bundy in the days leading
[03:11:05.720 --> 03:11:12.000]  up to it and on that day never openly carried a weapon and it is an absolute
[03:11:12.000 --> 03:11:16.520]  lie and it really really bothers me to see our government lying about this and
[03:11:16.520 --> 03:11:20.840]  now they have moved this on coming after somebody who was one of the very first
[03:11:20.840 --> 03:11:24.200]  constitutional sheriffs and peace officers that's why I talked to sheriff Mac
[03:11:24.200 --> 03:11:29.680]  about sheriff Glenn Palmer in the adjacent county is being accused of
[03:11:29.680 --> 03:11:35.160]  being a security leak because he talked to the people who were there at the
[03:11:35.160 --> 03:11:40.840]  occupation allowed them to travel into his county well the reality is is that
[03:11:40.840 --> 03:11:44.680]  the FBI and the other sheriff Dave Ward who was in Harney County where the
[03:11:44.680 --> 03:11:49.200]  occupation took place also talked to the people who were doing the occupation
[03:11:49.200 --> 03:11:53.200]  also allowed them to travel back and forth freely they were holding meetings
[03:11:53.200 --> 03:11:57.000]  they were going to church they were talking to people about natural resources
[03:11:57.000 --> 03:12:02.240]  issues as well as what had happened with the family who was so terribly abused
[03:12:02.240 --> 03:12:06.760]  by the government the Hammons and they were on their way to a meeting of 400
[03:12:06.760 --> 03:12:11.800]  people when the government ambushed them that was the words of Glenn Palmer the
[03:12:11.800 --> 03:12:16.040]  sheriff of of Grant County that they ambush them and if you look at that
[03:12:16.040 --> 03:12:21.360]  video you can see that they were in fact ambushed arrested all the people
[03:12:21.360 --> 03:12:25.760]  killed Levoie Finnecombe that was something that really set off the law
[03:12:25.760 --> 03:12:29.640]  enforcement officers in Oregon when he said that word it's simply is the truth
[03:12:29.640 --> 03:12:36.920]  but the long-term background of this is that the sheriff has also publicly
[03:12:36.920 --> 03:12:40.240]  talked along with Sheriff Clark and others many other prominent sheriff saying
[03:12:40.240 --> 03:12:43.680]  we are not going to enforce unconstitutional executive orders from
[03:12:43.680 --> 03:12:47.400]  Obama for gun control so he had opposed him on gun control he had stood with the
[03:12:47.400 --> 03:12:50.840]  people of that county deputized individuals to try to come up with a
[03:12:50.840 --> 03:12:55.040]  natural resources plan for that county where they could hopefully try to co-exist
[03:12:55.040 --> 03:13:01.000]  with the federal government that is trying to manage them into oblivion
[03:13:01.000 --> 03:13:05.120]  they've destroyed the economy there they're taking people's property they're
[03:13:05.120 --> 03:13:09.520]  taking their property rights it is absolutely shameful what is going on
[03:13:09.520 --> 03:13:15.400]  there but now the Oregon law enforcement organizations are accusing him of a
[03:13:15.400 --> 03:13:21.680]  security leak because of his opinions not because of any actions that he did
[03:13:21.680 --> 03:13:25.840]  that were any different from the other sheriff or the FBI and they're trying to
[03:13:25.840 --> 03:13:29.040]  get him effectively removed from office they can't remove him from office
[03:13:29.040 --> 03:13:33.520]  because he's an elected official and he's done a really good job from the
[03:13:33.520 --> 03:13:37.320]  people that I talked to in John Day Oregon and in Grant County of
[03:13:37.320 --> 03:13:42.040]  representing the people there of standing up for their interests but now if
[03:13:42.040 --> 03:13:46.960]  they remove his police certification that will effectively remove him from
[03:13:46.960 --> 03:13:51.160]  office and of course there's an election year coming up Sheriff Mack and the CPS
[03:13:51.160 --> 03:13:58.520]  CSPOA is going to try to do things to help this sheriff have a
[03:13:58.520 --> 03:14:02.480]  demonstration have a meeting of other sheriffs who would point out that he is
[03:14:02.480 --> 03:14:07.480]  simply exercising his opinion that doesn't make him a terrorist that doesn't
[03:14:07.480 --> 03:14:10.800]  make him a security leak and here we have this being done by the federal
[03:14:10.800 --> 03:14:16.560]  government which allows Hillary Clinton to have this unprecedented unprecedented
[03:14:16.560 --> 03:14:20.960]  leak of classified information and of course many people who have been
[03:14:20.960 --> 03:14:27.240]  prosecuted people who have gone to jail for much much less in terms of security
[03:14:27.240 --> 03:14:31.880]  leaks are just astounded that Hillary Clinton is too big to jail now let's
[03:14:31.880 --> 03:14:35.920]  talk about Nevada briefly and Sheldon Adelson there was a story on Politico
[03:14:35.920 --> 03:14:40.120]  Sheldon Adelson and the missing hundred million dollars it's kind of like the
[03:14:40.120 --> 03:14:45.040]  Sherlock Holmes story of the dog who did not bark why is it that Sheldon
[03:14:45.040 --> 03:14:50.120]  Adelson has not jumped into the the race this year with a massive amount of
[03:14:50.120 --> 03:14:54.920]  money he poured a hundred million dollars into the race four years ago and
[03:14:54.920 --> 03:14:59.960]  of course what he did was he gave a lot of money to to Newt Gingrich for example
[03:14:59.960 --> 03:15:05.600]  because Newt Gingrich had won the South Carolina primary and Newt Gingrich was
[03:15:05.600 --> 03:15:12.280]  the first and only person since 1980 who won the GOP South Carolina primary that
[03:15:12.280 --> 03:15:14.760]  did not go on to win the nomination that's what we talked about last night
[03:15:14.760 --> 03:15:18.120]  on the nightly news the fact that history is on the side of Donald Trump
[03:15:18.120 --> 03:15:22.880]  there's only been one time since 1980 that the winner of the South Carolina
[03:15:22.880 --> 03:15:27.040]  primary did not win the GOP nomination and that was Newt Gingrich four years
[03:15:27.040 --> 03:15:30.400]  ago and of course he was from neighboring Georgia so that helps it
[03:15:30.400 --> 03:15:34.280]  doesn't help Donald Trump to go to South Carolina with his New York accent let
[03:15:34.280 --> 03:15:38.200]  me tell you having lived in that area that's an uphill battle but he won in
[03:15:38.200 --> 03:15:43.840]  New Hampshire he won in South Carolina and historically every time that has
[03:15:43.840 --> 03:15:49.400]  happened in the GOP they've gone on to win the nomination but the system is not
[03:15:49.400 --> 03:15:53.120]  giving up on it that easily when I look at this story and of course Politico
[03:15:53.120 --> 03:15:57.520]  pulls up a lot of possible reasons for why Sheldon Adelson may not have jumped
[03:15:57.520 --> 03:16:01.400]  into this he's got some personal problems with the pending lawsuit but I
[03:16:01.400 --> 03:16:04.880]  don't think that's it I don't think they believe that's it either there's an
[03:16:04.880 --> 03:16:07.920]  indecision as to whether or not he's going to back Ruby or Cruz both of them
[03:16:07.920 --> 03:16:12.480]  have declared their undying loyalty to Zionism and have set this is at his
[03:16:12.480 --> 03:16:16.640]  feet basically he's patted them on the head and said good boy there'll be some
[03:16:16.640 --> 03:16:21.040]  cash coming for you but it hasn't appeared why not does he believe that
[03:16:21.040 --> 03:16:26.240]  he's throwing his money away on these two you know we had Marco Rubio say
[03:16:26.240 --> 03:16:29.720]  that Donald Trump and this is a talking point that he repeated from Carl
[03:16:29.720 --> 03:16:33.400]  Rove Carl Rove is said a couple of months ago Donald Trump has got a ceiling
[03:16:33.400 --> 03:16:36.760]  of 30 or 40 percent that means 70% of the people are gonna coalesce around an
[03:16:36.760 --> 03:16:41.920]  establishment candidate well that's simply not true the non-establishment
[03:16:41.920 --> 03:16:46.560]  votes are really Trump Cruz and Carson if you want to look at what the
[03:16:46.560 --> 03:16:52.560]  establishment has the establishment has Rubio, Jeb and Kasich and if you total
[03:16:52.560 --> 03:16:54.920]  that out first of all if you look at Rubio you can say the same thing about
[03:16:54.920 --> 03:16:58.260]  Rubio if you want to say talk about ceilings you can say Rubio has got a
[03:16:58.260 --> 03:17:03.600]  ceiling of about 22% he's never been higher than that and if you combine the
[03:17:03.600 --> 03:17:07.160]  other establishment candidates you get 30 to 40 percent I think things are
[03:17:07.160 --> 03:17:11.260]  going to break very differently than the establishment would like for it to
[03:17:11.260 --> 03:17:14.120]  break as a matter of fact we have an article up on info wars.com from Kit
[03:17:14.120 --> 03:17:19.120]  Daniels talking about how it looks like in a national poll the first national
[03:17:19.120 --> 03:17:24.440]  poll since Jeb has left it looks like most of his support and as a matter of
[03:17:24.440 --> 03:17:27.040]  fact the amount of support that he had was four or five percent most of that
[03:17:27.040 --> 03:17:31.960]  has gone to Trump I don't know what's going on with that it may not have gone
[03:17:31.960 --> 03:17:36.920]  to Trump or people just may have given up I don't know but when you look at
[03:17:36.920 --> 03:17:43.200]  Nevada for example the 1% support that Jeb Bush had it really doesn't matter
[03:17:43.200 --> 03:17:47.480]  where that goes he was a non-factor and that's one of the reasons why Jeb Bush
[03:17:47.480 --> 03:17:53.160]  got out we look at Marco Rubio however he is truly the establishment's candidate
[03:17:53.160 --> 03:17:57.840]  and not only the GOP establishment Wall Street establishment as well he has
[03:17:57.840 --> 03:18:02.680]  more money from the big banks from Wall Street than any candidate including Jeb
[03:18:02.680 --> 03:18:07.480]  and Hillary Jeb came in second with the massive amounts of money and Hillary came
[03:18:07.480 --> 03:18:12.200]  in third place but Marco Rubio is ahead of both of them in terms of
[03:18:12.200 --> 03:18:15.800]  establishment money and of course he'd been rumored to be ahead and the
[03:18:15.800 --> 03:18:19.720]  Sheldon Adelson primary but a Sheldon Adelson has kept his money so far
[03:18:19.720 --> 03:18:23.360]  remember that four years ago we had the Nevada primary that took place on a
[03:18:23.360 --> 03:18:28.000]  Saturday this year they had the South Carolina primary on a Saturday now
[03:18:28.000 --> 03:18:33.000]  they're having the Nevada caucus on a Tuesday because Sheldon Adelson created
[03:18:33.000 --> 03:18:37.880]  such a problem four years ago they had the caucus on a Saturday he said well
[03:18:37.880 --> 03:18:42.040]  this is not right because we have so many of us who are Jewish who cannot vote
[03:18:42.040 --> 03:18:47.120]  in this primary so we're going to have another one just for Jews only on Sunday
[03:18:47.120 --> 03:18:50.760]  remember that remember that happened a hell a lot of people who said well hey
[03:18:50.760 --> 03:18:54.640]  I had to work on Saturday night and I couldn't come to the caucus so I'm
[03:18:54.640 --> 03:19:00.320]  coming on Sunday and Sheldon Adelson tried to keep them out of that caucus
[03:19:00.320 --> 03:19:06.160]  they said you can't keep me out of a caucus because I'm not Jewish absolutely
[03:19:06.160 --> 03:19:11.320]  amazing what this man does Sheldon Adelson and of course so this this year
[03:19:11.320 --> 03:19:15.680]  to avoid that they moved it to a Tuesday when I look at what's happening with
[03:19:15.680 --> 03:19:20.840]  Donald Trump I've got to say that as I was listening to the Glen Beck people who
[03:19:20.840 --> 03:19:26.360]  are beating the drum incessantly for Ted Cruz looking at the polls they say well
[03:19:26.360 --> 03:19:29.800]  you know we look at the exit polls and people are saying if their most important
[03:19:29.800 --> 03:19:34.160]  thing is that they line up for somebody who supports what they believe in these
[03:19:34.160 --> 03:19:39.200]  they jump behind Ted Cruz and I have to say really what is how's that worked out
[03:19:39.200 --> 03:19:43.400]  for you in the GOP when you have said that you're going to support the person
[03:19:43.400 --> 03:19:49.000]  who tells you what you believe in have they followed through on that that's
[03:19:49.000 --> 03:19:53.160]  why people are rejecting Ted Cruz stay with us we're gonna be right back with
[03:19:53.160 --> 03:19:57.400]  Anthony Gucciardi and with Leanne McAdoo

[03:24:16.000 --> 03:24:19.480]  Gucci already to talk about our new product joint formula we're also going
[03:24:19.480 --> 03:24:23.560]  to be talking and the next segment I'll have Leanne McAdoo joining me we'll
[03:24:23.560 --> 03:24:27.520]  talk about the implications of what the federal government is doing with the
[03:24:27.520 --> 03:24:35.560]  iPhone issues with Apple as well as an amazing clip from with with MSNBC
[03:24:35.560 --> 03:24:40.760]  cutting off Bernie Sanders as he begins to talk about TPP what's behind that you
[03:24:40.760 --> 03:24:44.520]  know when somebody does the right thing I don't care who it is we're going to
[03:24:44.520 --> 03:24:48.760]  support them in that now of course Bernie Sanders doesn't support the other
[03:24:48.760 --> 03:24:53.240]  aspects of the globalist consolidation you know he's all for open borders he's
[03:24:53.240 --> 03:24:57.440]  for the climate change agreement especially those are those along with
[03:24:57.440 --> 03:25:01.440]  the TPP are three ways that the globalists are consolidating control
[03:25:01.440 --> 03:25:06.040]  Donald Trump by the way opposes all three of those the only candidate to
[03:25:06.040 --> 03:25:09.480]  oppose all three of those but joining us now is Anthony Gucci Artie Anthony you
[03:25:09.480 --> 03:25:12.720]  got a new formula a joint formula something that was just telling you
[03:25:12.720 --> 03:25:17.400]  during the break I could really use the this news cycle of the pressure and the
[03:25:17.400 --> 03:25:21.480]  time setting a lot and not getting much exercise is really taking its toll on my
[03:25:21.480 --> 03:25:25.920]  joints at my age no exactly in me too I had Lyme disease when I was really really
[03:25:25.920 --> 03:25:29.520]  young and it really destroyed a lot of my joints eat away your joints I know
[03:25:29.520 --> 03:25:33.640]  people that are on disability yeah from Lyme disease and joint formula is an
[03:25:33.640 --> 03:25:37.320]  exciting new product because it takes things like turmeric and it takes things
[03:25:37.320 --> 03:25:40.840]  like holy basil leaf and puts them all together in nine different ingredients
[03:25:40.840 --> 03:25:45.040]  into a formula that's really really low price in my view looking at the
[03:25:45.040 --> 03:25:48.840]  competitive prices and everything out there a comparable formula would be
[03:25:48.840 --> 03:25:53.840]  about 50 60 sometimes $70 if you get it on retail so this is really an exciting
[03:25:53.840 --> 03:25:57.720]  formula and it supports healthy joints it supports comfortable joints normal
[03:25:57.720 --> 03:26:01.880]  joint function and to me there's a huge misconception right because people think
[03:26:01.880 --> 03:26:05.680]  you have to be like an Olympian weightlifter or an athlete professional
[03:26:05.680 --> 03:26:09.800]  athlete to enjoy a joint formula something like that but the truth is
[03:26:09.800 --> 03:26:14.520]  we're sitting on our computers yes we're messing up our joints our postures are
[03:26:14.520 --> 03:26:18.800]  bad we're staring at the screen our neck is contorted I mean I have extreme neck
[03:26:18.800 --> 03:26:21.600]  pain just from the Lyme disease and also my posture I've been working on
[03:26:21.600 --> 03:26:25.380]  throughout the years this is something that I'm taking daily with a protein
[03:26:25.380 --> 03:26:29.200]  shake and all the other products as well and I'm finding it really really works
[03:26:29.200 --> 03:26:34.760]  it really does and the turmeric inside of it has been studied over at 4,600 in
[03:26:34.760 --> 03:26:38.520]  times according to the National Library of Medicine a lot of really good
[03:26:38.520 --> 03:26:42.520]  things for you besides just your joints I mean that they found a lot of they
[03:26:42.520 --> 03:26:45.280]  have very valuable uses for traumatic and the truth is we could go through all
[03:26:45.280 --> 03:26:48.040]  the studies but due to the regulations and everything we can't really talk
[03:26:48.040 --> 03:26:51.600]  about it right I mean I have I could have a stack of 4,000 studies we could go
[03:26:51.600 --> 03:26:54.760]  through but due to the regulations we can't talk about it the truth is you
[03:26:54.760 --> 03:26:57.880]  have to research it yourself you have to go to infowarslife.com check out
[03:26:57.880 --> 03:27:01.240]  joint formula look at the ingredients on there there are nine different ones
[03:27:01.240 --> 03:27:05.760]  that really really work you can feel the difference when you take this just like
[03:27:05.760 --> 03:27:08.880]  the rest of the amazing products in infowarslife.com and the reason I stand
[03:27:08.880 --> 03:27:13.480]  behind this okay is because I see what it does I see the emails that we can't
[03:27:13.480 --> 03:27:16.360]  even tell you about again because the regulations people saying how it's
[03:27:16.360 --> 03:27:20.280]  changed their life specifically people leaving phone messages trying on the
[03:27:20.280 --> 03:27:25.200]  phone okay yeah so to the haters consider that consider the lives they've
[03:27:25.200 --> 03:27:28.800]  changed consider the fact that the medical establishment is charging you
[03:27:28.800 --> 03:27:33.720]  $100 for a bag of saltwater saline solution okay I know people that own
[03:27:33.720 --> 03:27:39.800]  hospitals $100 for a bag of saline solution but God forbid we give you the
[03:27:39.800 --> 03:27:44.400]  best organic stuff out there and give it to you for a low cost and a low price I
[03:27:44.400 --> 03:27:48.040]  mean so in my view joint formula is a must-have along with the other products
[03:27:48.040 --> 03:27:51.520]  infowarslife.com and I would definitely check it out and of course one of the
[03:27:51.520 --> 03:27:55.400]  things I didn't realize when we're looking at this is is signing up for
[03:27:55.400 --> 03:28:00.080]  auto-ship and of course that gets you a 10% discount each month and to make sure
[03:28:00.080 --> 03:28:03.120]  that you're going to get those products each month before you run out so you set
[03:28:03.120 --> 03:28:06.200]  up your frequency and you get that 10% the thing I thought that was just a
[03:28:06.200 --> 03:28:10.520]  initial sign-up bonus you know 10% thing is like and I saw well you get that each
[03:28:10.520 --> 03:28:14.600]  month it's like wow that's huge and also supermail vitality is running out and
[03:28:14.600 --> 03:28:18.120]  if you sign up for auto-ship we've decided now to hold back bottles for
[03:28:18.120 --> 03:28:21.360]  auto-ship people so they'll pretty much never run out you know unless there's a
[03:28:21.360 --> 03:28:24.600]  huge huge shortage pretty much never run out if you get auto-ship so we can always
[03:28:24.600 --> 03:28:27.440]  hold something back for auto-ship but anyway I would encourage everyone to
[03:28:27.440 --> 03:28:30.520]  get info go to infowarslife.com it really funds everything that's why I'm
[03:28:30.520 --> 03:28:33.640]  passionate about it it makes everything possible if you like free thought if you
[03:28:33.640 --> 03:28:38.040]  like free speech if you like free ideology if you don't like the mainstream
[03:28:38.040 --> 03:28:41.480]  media narrative controlling everything then support the things that you do like
[03:28:41.480 --> 03:28:45.840]  and that's just a way that that we fund it in terms of trying to offer people as
[03:28:45.840 --> 03:28:49.280]  as Alex has said many times a win-win situation we try to offer you good
[03:28:49.280 --> 03:28:52.520]  products at a good price that are going to help you with your health and that's
[03:28:52.520 --> 03:28:56.240]  the way we fund our operation I mean we could get a government subsidy or we
[03:28:56.240 --> 03:28:59.680]  could ask people to just do it on a donation basis there's a lot of
[03:28:59.680 --> 03:29:03.640]  different ways we could do it or we could just have people embed ads into our
[03:29:03.640 --> 03:29:09.400]  site but that gives us more independence not have people embed their ads into
[03:29:09.400 --> 03:29:12.520]  our site and of course we're not gonna take any government money they wouldn't
[03:29:12.520 --> 03:29:15.800]  give it to us anyway well you know I'm also tired of this weird narrative that
[03:29:15.800 --> 03:29:19.920]  it's okay for everyone to go into Walmart and buy a Coca-Cola Pepsi and
[03:29:19.920 --> 03:29:23.000]  other junk but God forbid you actually buy something that's good for you and
[03:29:23.000 --> 03:29:26.200]  healthy and fund something you like so for me it's a win it's win-win as Alex
[03:29:26.200 --> 03:29:30.240]  would say it's 360 win thank you Anthony of course that's our new product joint
[03:29:30.240 --> 03:29:33.160]  formula we're gonna be right back with Leanne McAdoo we're gonna talk about
[03:29:33.160 --> 03:29:36.840]  what's going on with the iPhone with the Justice Department is this truly a

[03:30:02.760 --> 03:30:07.520]  Saudi Arabia says it wants to arm jihadist in the country with anti-aircraft
[03:30:07.520 --> 03:30:11.920]  missiles to take out Russian jets we believe that introducing surface-to-air
[03:30:11.920 --> 03:30:16.080]  missiles in Syria is going to change the balance of power on the ground said
[03:30:16.080 --> 03:30:20.840]  the Saudi foreign minister he continued it will allow the moderate opposition to
[03:30:20.840 --> 03:30:24.880]  be able to neutralize the helicopters and aircraft that are dropping chemicals
[03:30:24.880 --> 03:30:28.440]  and have been carpet bombing them just like the surface-to-air missiles in
[03:30:28.440 --> 03:30:32.560]  Afghanistan were able to change the balance of power there this has to be
[03:30:32.560 --> 03:30:36.720]  studied very carefully however because you don't want such weaponry to fall
[03:30:36.720 --> 03:30:41.360]  into the wrong hands even the New York Times admits there are few if any

[03:33:28.400 --> 03:33:34.800]  Alex Jones welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight and joining
[03:33:34.800 --> 03:33:39.840]  you now as Leanne McAdoo we're going to talk about this iPhone situation but
[03:33:39.840 --> 03:33:43.760]  before we do I want to finish with some of the news that I had about the
[03:33:43.760 --> 03:33:49.400]  Nevada caucus today as we said earlier when somebody says the right thing we
[03:33:49.400 --> 03:33:56.240]  support them and you know when I look at the support of Donald Trump the Glenn
[03:33:56.240 --> 03:34:01.280]  Beck organization is wringing their hands over the fact that the number one
[03:34:01.280 --> 03:34:04.080]  thing that people said about Donald Trump in the exit polls in South Carolina
[03:34:04.080 --> 03:34:10.360]  was that he tells it like it is he's straight with people as opposed to the
[03:34:10.360 --> 03:34:14.160]  number one thing they said about Ted Cruz he shares our values and I have to
[03:34:14.160 --> 03:34:20.280]  say to those people does Ted Cruz really share your values how many times have
[03:34:20.280 --> 03:34:26.040]  you been lied to by these slick operators these slick politicians in the
[03:34:26.040 --> 03:34:31.400]  GOP telling you precisely what you want to hear and then doing exactly the
[03:34:31.400 --> 03:34:36.560]  opposite Marco Rubio is exhibit a but of course the entire GOP establishment has
[03:34:36.560 --> 03:34:42.440]  done that to you time and again that by the way Glenn Beck and others is why
[03:34:42.440 --> 03:34:46.640]  that doesn't carry much weight with people along with the fact that Ted Cruz
[03:34:46.640 --> 03:34:53.040]  has set up a kind of micro management of people profiling everyone down to the
[03:34:53.040 --> 03:34:57.640]  individual level to give them a personalized spiel this is what you
[03:34:57.640 --> 03:35:01.320]  want to hear so I'll tell you exactly what you want to hear can you really
[03:35:01.320 --> 03:35:05.840]  trust this guy I mean look at what happened in the Iowa caucus look at what
[03:35:05.840 --> 03:35:10.440]  just happened with this video that came out he had to fire his communications
[03:35:10.440 --> 03:35:14.800]  director absolutely amazing but I want to play this clip from Bernie Sanders
[03:35:14.800 --> 03:35:19.560]  because Bernie Sanders was on MSNBC and he started to talk about the
[03:35:19.560 --> 03:35:25.080]  Trans-Pacific Partnership which is not free trade folks Bernie Sanders opposes
[03:35:25.080 --> 03:35:29.440]  it because he says it's free trade it is not free trade it has a lot of other
[03:35:29.440 --> 03:35:36.080]  issues but even on the trade issue the TPP is managed trade not free managed
[03:35:36.080 --> 03:35:41.280]  trade and that trade will be managed by an international commission that is
[03:35:41.280 --> 03:35:46.640]  unaccountable unelected by any of the countries that have created it so your
[03:35:46.640 --> 03:35:50.600]  trade we managed by this international commission that you don't know anything
[03:35:50.600 --> 03:35:56.760]  about just as the TPP itself was created by this group of lobbyists meeting in
[03:35:56.760 --> 03:35:59.960]  secret that wouldn't let people take a look at it although once they put it
[03:35:59.960 --> 03:36:04.160]  there nobody in Congress Democrat or Republican really cared to look at it
[03:36:04.160 --> 03:36:08.560]  except senator Sessions and he is the one who pointed out that it is going to be a
[03:36:08.560 --> 03:36:14.120]  living document in other words whatever it says in these 5,000 pages it can just
[03:36:14.120 --> 03:36:18.320]  be wiped away the next day by this international commission their ability
[03:36:18.320 --> 03:36:24.680]  to change the terms of trade of export import gives them the ability to manage
[03:36:24.680 --> 03:36:29.200]  every last detail of your economy to determine who the winners and losers are
[03:36:29.200 --> 03:36:34.480]  going to be this is not free trade this is trade that is managed by a global
[03:36:34.480 --> 03:36:38.640]  elite that you have no accountability to but here's what Bernie Sanders did and
[03:36:38.640 --> 03:36:43.480]  here's how MSNBC cut him off as soon as he started talking about the TPP
[03:36:43.480 --> 03:36:49.320]  against CAFTA against permanent normal trade relations with China and I am
[03:36:49.320 --> 03:37:02.200]  helping to lead the opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership we've been
[03:37:02.200 --> 03:37:06.040]  listening to Bernie Sanders less of a news conference more of a speech in
[03:37:06.040 --> 03:37:12.680]  Boston they're drawing contrast with Hillary Clinton let's cut that off right
[03:37:12.680 --> 03:37:16.880]  away okay now in the article that we have up an info wars icon they point out
[03:37:16.880 --> 03:37:22.080]  that MSNBC is owned by Comcast Comcast benefits from the treaty and they point
[03:37:22.080 --> 03:37:25.280]  out that in the first three months of the year they have targeted Senate and
[03:37:25.280 --> 03:37:29.960]  House representatives on issues relating to TPP and have spent $40,000 on
[03:37:29.960 --> 03:37:34.680]  that single issue in just three months furthermore over an 18 month period
[03:37:34.680 --> 03:37:43.000]  between 2013 and 2015 MSNBC only discussed TPP twice with the exception of
[03:37:43.000 --> 03:37:47.240]  Ed Schultz who talked about it regularly he talked about it in 71 broadcasts but
[03:37:47.240 --> 03:37:51.920]  Ed Schultz was dismissed many people believe that was the reason Ed Schultz
[03:37:51.920 --> 03:37:56.920]  was dismissed right had to go to RT yeah absolutely now I want to play for you
[03:37:56.920 --> 03:38:01.280]  another video this is Hillary Clinton and this gets to the core of something
[03:38:01.280 --> 03:38:05.680]  that is really bothering me in this election cycle and that is the kind of
[03:38:05.680 --> 03:38:12.200]  phony revivalism competing for the endorsement of Jesus that these
[03:38:12.200 --> 03:38:17.960]  politicians are doing here's Hillary Clinton doing her singing gospel routine
[03:38:17.960 --> 03:38:21.840]  at the gospel awards show
[03:38:21.840 --> 03:38:40.200]  yeah that's it okay this is like her version of the Obama's amazing grace
[03:38:40.200 --> 03:38:55.640]  it's about the gospel and what it means to so many of us okay there we go see
[03:38:55.640 --> 03:39:02.480]  that is just beyond belief beyond belief to see that and yet you know this is
[03:39:02.480 --> 03:39:06.840]  also like the kind of phony revivalism we see from Glenn Beck telling people to
[03:39:06.840 --> 03:39:12.040]  join me in fasting for Ted Cruz and country telling people that God removed
[03:39:12.040 --> 03:39:15.800]  Scalia so that Ted Cruz would have an easy way and yeah because you know what
[03:39:15.800 --> 03:39:22.560]  Scalia is an originalist Scalia what you're not qualified as a natural born
[03:39:22.560 --> 03:39:26.560]  citizen and it's still not going to take the issue off the table for Ted Cruz
[03:39:26.560 --> 03:39:30.880]  because the issue is going to be front and center people are saying that Ted
[03:39:30.880 --> 03:39:35.120]  Cruz needs to recuse himself not only from the Senate Judiciary Committee
[03:39:35.120 --> 03:39:39.560]  that's going to be involved in possibly looking at judges but also from even
[03:39:39.560 --> 03:39:44.440]  voting on any possible recommendations for judges because a Supreme Court judge
[03:39:44.440 --> 03:39:49.720]  will likely if he is successful in his presidential bid would be setting in
[03:39:49.720 --> 03:39:53.000]  judgment of whether or not he is a natural born citizen so he has a conflict
[03:39:53.000 --> 03:39:56.680]  of interest so the very fact that they're talking about this is going to
[03:39:56.680 --> 03:40:01.840]  bring the issue of the fact that Ted Cruz has as Donald Trump pointed it out
[03:40:01.840 --> 03:40:06.920]  just like the Keystone pipeline he has run from Canada to Texas okay it's not
[03:40:06.920 --> 03:40:11.760]  a natural born citizen and of course we also had this other thing that came up
[03:40:11.760 --> 03:40:19.040]  with the Cruz campaign this issue where they put out for almost two days this
[03:40:19.040 --> 03:40:25.240]  video that said that Rubio had walked by the table where Ted Cruz's father was
[03:40:25.240 --> 03:40:29.440]  Ted Cruz's father is a pastor and had a Bible on the table and said that Rubio
[03:40:29.440 --> 03:40:34.400]  walked past him and said there's no answers in that book now why would you
[03:40:34.400 --> 03:40:39.360]  do that that absolutely made no sense however there's an organization here
[03:40:39.360 --> 03:40:43.360]  that that took full credit for that the Daily Pennsylvanian DP politics blog
[03:40:43.360 --> 03:40:47.640]  they were the said we were there it was their video they put it up they put it
[03:40:47.640 --> 03:40:52.360]  up with that original interpretation however throughout all of this this was
[03:40:52.360 --> 03:40:55.480]  on Saturday at 10 in the morning I looked at their timeline of when they
[03:40:55.480 --> 03:40:59.040]  did all this they put this up on 10 in the morning and it was a day and a half
[03:40:59.040 --> 03:41:05.000]  later that Cruz's communication director Rick Tyler tweeted it out okay and then
[03:41:05.000 --> 03:41:09.600]  it was another day and at 16 hours later before he took it down and many
[03:41:09.600 --> 03:41:13.960]  people were part pointing out that this was not the case and Ted Cruz's dad was
[03:41:13.960 --> 03:41:17.880]  there that's the key issue to me his dad was there could have said no this didn't
[03:41:17.880 --> 03:41:21.600]  happen he didn't troll us that way right you know I mean it absolutely made no
[03:41:21.600 --> 03:41:27.240]  sense that Marco Rubio or any other politician would dump on the Bible like
[03:41:27.240 --> 03:41:30.120]  that when you've got Hillary Clinton going out and saying yeah we celebrate
[03:41:30.120 --> 03:41:34.080]  the gospel I mean it is where I mean Christianity has been under attack for
[03:41:34.080 --> 03:41:37.960]  years in this country and now because it's an election year now they're gonna
[03:41:37.960 --> 03:41:42.200]  start going and doing the little dance and saying we where was where was she
[03:41:42.200 --> 03:41:46.320]  when they were shutting down the Christian bakery yeah exactly you know
[03:41:46.320 --> 03:41:50.440]  where was she exactly they don't ever and you know of all people you know
[03:41:50.440 --> 03:41:54.960]  politicians should not be claiming that they have the endorsement of Jesus and
[03:41:54.960 --> 03:41:59.040]  this is what we're seeing over and over again especially the people who seem to
[03:41:59.040 --> 03:42:03.640]  be the most involved with dirty tricks like Ted Cruz and the Iowa caucus with
[03:42:03.640 --> 03:42:07.800]  Ben Carson that whole timeline as well if you look at that that wasn't like oh
[03:42:07.800 --> 03:42:13.080]  this just broke and we who knew that this wasn't true no the story was tweeted
[03:42:13.080 --> 03:42:17.480]  out that Ben Carson was going to be traveling and he was not going to be
[03:42:17.480 --> 03:42:21.560]  staying there but regardless the fact that he was going to Tampa and then he
[03:42:21.560 --> 03:42:25.600]  are going to Florida and then he was going to go to a prayer breakfast in
[03:42:25.600 --> 03:42:29.000]  Washington regardless of the results he was not dropping out that was made very
[03:42:29.000 --> 03:42:32.120]  clear there were cut there were three tweets that came out within two minutes
[03:42:32.120 --> 03:42:37.320]  of each other 20 minutes before the caucuses began and as the caucuses
[03:42:37.320 --> 03:42:43.760]  began that was when Steve King and others in the Carson camp were spreading
[03:42:43.760 --> 03:42:48.080]  the rumors throughout the caucuses that Ben Carson had dropped out and they
[03:42:48.080 --> 03:42:53.040]  continued to do that for another half hour even after it was made it was made
[03:42:53.040 --> 03:42:56.440]  clear at the very beginning that that was not the case it was made clear
[03:42:56.440 --> 03:43:01.200]  subsequent to that and it was made clear but they they did that for an entire half
[03:43:01.200 --> 03:43:04.640]  hour they were putting that narrative out so when you have people out here who
[03:43:04.640 --> 03:43:10.960]  are pulling dirty tricks like that I've got to say that the hypocrisy is just so
[03:43:10.960 --> 03:43:14.320]  obvious to everybody Christian and non-Christian alike and that's the worst
[03:43:14.320 --> 03:43:20.520]  thing about it that these people who would do this thing are basically
[03:43:20.520 --> 03:43:24.720]  underscoring the narrative that many non-christians believe it is all
[03:43:24.720 --> 03:43:29.640]  phony that it is all cynical and all hypocritical it just feeds that narrative
[03:43:29.640 --> 03:43:35.200]  and I hate to see them yeah for whoever exactly I hate to see them you know
[03:43:35.200 --> 03:43:39.960]  besmirch the the the you know the Lord Jesus Christ with their dirty trick
[03:43:39.960 --> 03:43:44.680]  politics and and trying to use him to to win an office it's just disgusting to me
[03:43:44.680 --> 03:43:49.680]  I think that's the reason why Donald Trump got more evangelicals in South
[03:43:49.680 --> 03:43:54.480]  Carolina than Ted Cruz did you know this hypocrisy is a stench and I'm sick and
[03:43:54.480 --> 03:43:58.480]  tired of seeing it and it is even more ridiculous Hillary I guess believes that
[03:43:58.480 --> 03:44:02.160]  she can get away with it as well well she just truly believes that she can
[03:44:02.160 --> 03:44:05.640]  coast through everything I mean she all of these years her and her husband have
[03:44:05.640 --> 03:44:10.840]  been completely protected by the DC media and only now is it finally starting to
[03:44:10.840 --> 03:44:14.440]  trickle in the opposite direction yeah of course that's with the advent of the
[03:44:14.440 --> 03:44:19.000]  internet she can't hide it well she's she's still not being prosecuted for the
[03:44:19.000 --> 03:44:23.360]  security breaches in terms of the quantity and in terms of the severity of
[03:44:23.360 --> 03:44:26.200]  these security breaches we've never seen anything like it and yet there have been
[03:44:26.200 --> 03:44:29.600]  many people who have been who are whistleblowers legitimate whistleblowers
[03:44:29.600 --> 03:44:33.520]  who have been persecuted many of them have been jailed for doing far far far
[03:44:33.520 --> 03:44:37.120]  less than what Hillary Clinton so she's still getting away with it but that's
[03:44:37.120 --> 03:44:40.360]  one of the things I think is interesting is that Donald Trump has said that he
[03:44:40.360 --> 03:44:44.440]  would prosecute her if he wins so she is in the fight of her life it's either the
[03:44:44.440 --> 03:44:47.920]  White House or the big house right that's what's gonna happen alright now
[03:44:47.920 --> 03:44:52.400]  let's talk about the iPhone thing because you know I agree with what Donald
[03:44:52.400 --> 03:44:56.080]  Trump is doing in terms of 9-11 truth talking about now he's gonna audit the
[03:44:56.080 --> 03:45:01.840]  Fed talking about and I believe again this this these three different issues
[03:45:01.840 --> 03:45:07.720]  of stopping the globalist consolidation the takedown of the borders the climate
[03:45:07.720 --> 03:45:13.960]  change treaty which would enact a global taxation regime as well as the
[03:45:13.960 --> 03:45:19.120]  Trans-Pacific Partnership which would have managed trade for the US not
[03:45:19.120 --> 03:45:22.560]  managed for our benefit all three of those things he opposes and I believe
[03:45:22.560 --> 03:45:27.040]  he's authentic on it because for 30 30 years ago 35 years ago he was taking out
[03:45:27.040 --> 03:45:30.200]  ads in the New York Times spending a hundred thousand dollars of his own
[03:45:30.200 --> 03:45:34.440]  money 35 years ago complaining about this so I believe that he is sincerely
[03:45:34.440 --> 03:45:39.280]  against those things and it is truly amazing to see him go in directions in
[03:45:39.280 --> 03:45:43.840]  terms of investigating the missing classified pages from the 9-11 report
[03:45:43.840 --> 03:45:48.600]  that even Ron Paul did not go after so it's great to see that happen however he
[03:45:48.600 --> 03:45:54.880]  is wrong on this issue about the iPhone I think it's a very dangerous precedent
[03:45:54.880 --> 03:45:58.800]  that would be set and of course we have lawyers for Apple and many other people
[03:45:58.800 --> 03:46:01.560]  are saying that it would be a very dangerous precedent absolutely and
[03:46:01.560 --> 03:46:06.800]  even just watching Donald Trump say that I truly think that he just like most of
[03:46:06.800 --> 03:46:10.800]  America has no idea what he's really talking about because he says Apple ought
[03:46:10.800 --> 03:46:15.960]  to give the security for that phone but it's not about them giving the security
[03:46:15.960 --> 03:46:21.080]  passcode over they're having to create a new backdoor rewrite their operating
[03:46:21.080 --> 03:46:24.520]  system yes it's not something they even have and here's an article from a
[03:46:24.520 --> 03:46:31.480]  organization SOTT.net they say it's a dangerous precedent it also involves the
[03:46:31.480 --> 03:46:35.800]  All Rits Act that the government is twisting into a way that it has never
[03:46:35.800 --> 03:46:39.560]  been used before but he points out and this is from Tim Cook he said the US
[03:46:39.560 --> 03:46:42.440]  government has asked us for something we simply do not have something we
[03:46:42.440 --> 03:46:46.000]  consider too dangerous to create and they go on to say well what happens when
[03:46:46.000 --> 03:46:49.120]  the government goes to court to demand that you give it something that you do
[03:46:49.120 --> 03:46:53.840]  not have no one has it in fact because it doesn't exist what if the government
[03:46:53.840 --> 03:46:59.960]  then proceeds you proceeds to order you to construct design invent or somehow
[03:46:59.960 --> 03:47:05.120]  conjure up the thing that it wants are you obliged to do that that is truly the
[03:47:05.120 --> 03:47:09.080]  question and I think what's happening here with this case of the San Bernardino
[03:47:09.080 --> 03:47:15.400]  shooting we have seen high-profile acts of violence like this used as a beard to
[03:47:15.400 --> 03:47:20.160]  advance a gun control agenda right what is going on here now is that the FBI is
[03:47:20.160 --> 03:47:23.720]  using this and the security state surveillance state is using this to
[03:47:23.720 --> 03:47:28.920]  advance their agenda of surveillance they're using this high-profile case to
[03:47:28.920 --> 03:47:33.880]  try to set a precedent and that's why I think John McAfee came out and said hey
[03:47:33.880 --> 03:47:38.440]  I'll open it up for you you don't really need to force Apple to do this we don't
[03:47:38.440 --> 03:47:42.480]  need to establish a precedent because once you do this now the genie is out of
[03:47:42.480 --> 03:47:45.680]  the box it truly is opening up a Pandora's box because you've now set up a
[03:47:45.680 --> 03:47:50.360]  legal precedent and and the FBI just they keep repeating this we simply just
[03:47:50.360 --> 03:47:56.000]  want to use it this one time in this one instance how can you say that and how
[03:47:56.000 --> 03:48:00.040]  dare you look at these victims we just want justice meanwhile they have at
[03:48:00.040 --> 03:48:05.680]  least 12 other phones that they're waiting to break into they're not
[03:48:05.680 --> 03:48:09.680]  iPhones they're an older operating system so that's the big thing is that
[03:48:09.680 --> 03:48:14.440]  Apple they promise their users with this new operating system that the only way
[03:48:14.440 --> 03:48:18.800]  to get into that information would be via the passcode and so that's what they're
[03:48:18.800 --> 03:48:22.680]  saying we don't have it and well it creates a lot of concerns because they're
[03:48:22.680 --> 03:48:27.280]  also using a bogus non-sequitur legal argument right in my opinion from the
[03:48:27.280 --> 03:48:32.880]  hundreds yeah this is from 1789 the All Rits Act okay it says federal courts can
[03:48:32.880 --> 03:48:37.920]  issue quote all rits necessary or appropriate and aid of their respective
[03:48:37.920 --> 03:48:42.000]  jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and the principles of law and as
[03:48:42.000 --> 03:48:46.080]  those SOTT points out read as a whole this simply means that judges can tell
[03:48:46.080 --> 03:48:51.320]  people to follow the law but they have to do so in a way that in itself respects
[03:48:51.320 --> 03:48:56.280]  the law this doesn't give them the authority to do this in any way shape or
[03:48:56.280 --> 03:49:02.640]  form they ignore the plainly written lines of the Constitution about our
[03:49:02.640 --> 03:49:07.280]  privacy about the Fourth Amendment and they come and they take an obscure act
[03:49:07.280 --> 03:49:11.760]  like this well pursuant to the All Rits Act of 1789 take it completely out of
[03:49:11.760 --> 03:49:15.720]  context make it mean something that it never meant before and use this to try
[03:49:15.720 --> 03:49:20.760]  to establish a legal precedent to allow them to legally do right what they are
[03:49:20.760 --> 03:49:24.320]  already illegally doing to everybody according in violation of the Fourth
[03:49:24.320 --> 03:49:28.560]  Amendment and you're really seeing this push to damage the reputation of Apple
[03:49:28.560 --> 03:49:33.720]  NPR says is Apple's denial to unlock shooters iPhone hurting its image well
[03:49:33.720 --> 03:49:37.120]  if anything it's probably improving its image to people who care about their
[03:49:37.120 --> 03:49:42.760]  privacy and it will be corporate suicide right do this because nobody nobody
[03:49:42.760 --> 03:49:46.720]  none of their customers want this they already got this operating system
[03:49:46.720 --> 03:49:51.360]  exactly they've already been targeted as as being a collaborator with the
[03:49:51.360 --> 03:49:55.120]  government and of course there's more to this as well and since that the
[03:49:55.120 --> 03:49:58.920]  government and Google are moving against Apple and many other ways I want to
[03:49:58.920 --> 03:50:03.240]  point out another article that someone on Twitter pointed out to me this is
[03:50:03.240 --> 03:50:08.280]  going back to February the 5th this year in the Hill this is somebody who was
[03:50:08.280 --> 03:50:12.440]  working for Department of Homeland Security back when we had the
[03:50:12.440 --> 03:50:18.120]  underwear bomber case back in Christmas of 2009 he just retired and he says at
[03:50:18.120 --> 03:50:23.920]  the time Obama criticized DHS and said well this is a failure to connect the
[03:50:23.920 --> 03:50:29.200]  dots he says after leaving my 15-year career at DHS I can no longer be silent
[03:50:29.200 --> 03:50:32.640]  about the dangerous state of America's counterterror strategy our leaders
[03:50:32.640 --> 03:50:36.000]  willingness to compromise things he said just before the Christmas Day attack I
[03:50:36.000 --> 03:50:39.440]  was ordered by my superiors in the Department of Homeland Security to
[03:50:39.440 --> 03:50:44.160]  delete or modify several hundred records of individuals tied to designated
[03:50:44.160 --> 03:50:48.240]  Islamist terror groups like Hamas from in federal important federal databases
[03:50:48.240 --> 03:50:53.640]  here's a situation where we know from Kurt Haskell and others we know this was
[03:50:53.640 --> 03:50:56.880]  a false flag attack and the federal government is deleting those records is
[03:50:56.880 --> 03:50:59.640]  that what they want out of the San Bernardino shooters phone my name is

[03:54:09.720 --> 03:54:15.000]  McAdee we're going to finish up on this iPhone issue what is truly behind it the
[03:54:15.000 --> 03:54:18.640]  dangerous precedent that it could set in this course as I just mentioned before
[03:54:18.640 --> 03:54:23.520]  we went to break the fact that you now have just a few days ago you had on the
[03:54:23.520 --> 03:54:30.880]  hill a former DHS career person spent 15 years there talking about how with the
[03:54:30.880 --> 03:54:35.880]  underwear bomber he was ordered to delete the records of hundreds of Muslims
[03:54:35.880 --> 03:54:41.000]  with terrorist ties as that was happening very important that we
[03:54:41.000 --> 03:54:44.880]  understand that there's multiple reasons that the government would want to get
[03:54:44.880 --> 03:54:49.880]  into this data maybe they want to get rid of data that would incriminate their
[03:54:49.880 --> 03:54:53.720]  culpability in allowing this to happen or their complicity in allowing this to
[03:54:53.720 --> 03:54:56.960]  happen right before we continue with this I just want to let you know remind
[03:54:56.960 --> 03:55:02.320]  you again about our new formulation info wars joint formulas now arrived at
[03:55:02.320 --> 03:55:05.920]  info wars life comm specifically designed to support the body's natural

[03:55:10.440 --> 03:55:15.440]  was telling Anthony Gucci Arti sitting here kind of captivated in front of a
[03:55:15.440 --> 03:55:20.040]  monitor in front of a microphone is something that I am really feeling is the
[03:55:20.040 --> 03:55:24.080]  joint pain you don't have to be an athlete it's somebody that and if you're

[03:55:35.920 --> 03:55:42.360]  wars life comm that is joint formula okay Leanne finish up with the the iPhone
[03:55:42.360 --> 03:55:46.440]  issue here well a lot of people are saying that this is great because it
[03:55:46.440 --> 03:55:49.560]  sort of confirms the fact that the government doesn't have a pre-existing
[03:55:49.560 --> 03:55:54.600]  backdoor into the iPhone but that could be true and maybe maybe this is just a
[03:55:54.600 --> 03:55:58.720]  beard yeah I don't trust any of this stuff okay so that even that doesn't
[03:55:58.720 --> 03:56:01.640]  convince me that they don't already have a backdoor there because we've seen
[03:56:01.640 --> 03:56:05.320]  issue we've seen implications about that with a prison program and other things
[03:56:05.320 --> 03:56:08.200]  that they'd already put in backdoors right and of course this was one of their
[03:56:08.200 --> 03:56:11.960]  big promises that they made to everyone who bought this new version of the iPhone
[03:56:11.960 --> 03:56:16.200]  that they're the only way you could get in was via the passcode and so of course
[03:56:16.200 --> 03:56:22.000]  if they now just easily open this up without a specific court order you know
[03:56:22.000 --> 03:56:26.480]  then they could be sued someone could say the false advertising so I mean they
[03:56:26.480 --> 03:56:30.800]  there's they're waiting for the court to demand and then they will comply and
[03:56:30.800 --> 03:56:34.640]  that's what Bill Gates says of course he comes out and says well this is not
[03:56:34.640 --> 03:56:38.440]  going to set a precedent and they should just hand over well in the course of
[03:56:38.440 --> 03:56:43.360]  Microsoft was was by far and away the first corporation to sign up to the
[03:56:43.360 --> 03:56:47.440]  prison program we saw leaked out of Ed Snowden's files they were the very
[03:56:47.440 --> 03:56:51.880]  first ones in there followed by Google as well and the last ones to come in
[03:56:51.880 --> 03:56:57.200]  were Apple but they did come in okay and I think they came in as Steve Jobs is
[03:56:57.200 --> 03:57:00.400]  no longer involved with the company be and that may be one of the reasons why
[03:57:00.400 --> 03:57:04.720]  Steve Jobs is no longer with us he never was a part of that as far as I could
[03:57:04.720 --> 03:57:08.640]  tell well I know they're gonna be having a rallies across the country possibly
[03:57:08.640 --> 03:57:13.120]  even across the globe the hashtag don't break our phone that's gonna be
[03:57:13.120 --> 03:57:18.120]  happening today a lot of people I know LADC New York there's gonna be probably

[03:57:28.000 --> 03:57:31.880]  Security Week talking about surveillance video recorders they have hard coded
[03:57:31.880 --> 03:57:36.240]  passwords in them there's 60,000 units shipped every month by this Chinese
[03:57:36.240 --> 03:57:41.720]  based manufacturer Zuhai Raysharp and they say there's a web interface that
[03:57:41.720 --> 03:57:45.600]  allows users to manage the devices view recorded video control surveillance
[03:57:45.600 --> 03:57:49.280]  cameras however researchers found the devices could be accessed with the
[03:57:49.280 --> 03:57:55.600]  username root and a password 519070 although older reports suggest in some

[03:58:07.880 --> 03:58:12.920]  in somebody discovers these backdoors but the government desperately wants to
[03:58:12.920 --> 03:58:17.120]  have a key to everybody's door and that's like saying hey somebody broke into
