[00:00.000 --> 00:14.880]  And now, the tip of the spear, leading the fight to take back the nation, it's Olin Shroyer.
[00:14.880 --> 00:19.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[00:19.480 --> 00:23.080]  That's right, taking back America.
[00:23.080 --> 00:27.760]  President Trump is standing up for America right now to NATO that's been ripping us five
[00:27.760 --> 00:37.080]  ways from Sunday, standing up for truth in the face of Theresa May telling her exactly
[00:37.080 --> 00:41.720]  what immigration has done to her country and Europe.
[00:41.720 --> 00:43.960]  And President Trump is in London right now.
[00:43.960 --> 00:49.160]  There are some festivities going down, including some Trump protesters.
[00:49.160 --> 00:53.240]  Let's see what our Paul Joseph Watson has to say about them.
[00:53.240 --> 00:55.760]  Look at this proud member of the resistance.
[00:55.760 --> 00:58.840]  She flipped off Trump's motorcade.
[00:58.840 --> 00:59.840]  So stunning.
[00:59.840 --> 01:00.840]  So brave.
[01:00.840 --> 01:01.840]  Move over, Tankman.
[01:01.840 --> 01:04.000]  There's a new protest icon in town.
[01:04.000 --> 01:05.000]  Oh, but wait.
[01:05.000 --> 01:08.120]  I now believe this was the motorcade on the way to pick him up from Stanford.
[01:08.120 --> 01:09.760]  However, sentiment still very much stands.
[01:09.760 --> 01:10.760]  Middle finger still proudly raised.
[01:10.760 --> 01:11.760]  It has rotted.
[01:11.760 --> 01:12.760]  I've been astray.
[01:12.760 --> 01:13.760]  In everything you've ever done.
[01:13.760 --> 01:14.760]  We were backing off in inanimate objects.
[01:14.760 --> 01:18.600]  He flipped off Olinia's suitcases and some low-paid drivers who were just trying to do
[01:18.600 --> 01:19.600]  their job.
[01:19.600 --> 01:22.040]  Trump wasn't even in the car.
[01:22.040 --> 01:23.600]  Not all heroes wear capes.
[01:23.600 --> 01:25.600]  Look at this amnesty international idiot.
[01:25.600 --> 01:31.360]  So we've just unveiled a giant 15 by 3 meter banner on Voxel Bridge facing the new U.S.
[01:31.360 --> 01:32.360]  Embassy.
[01:32.360 --> 01:36.400]  Yeah, it's so giant that nobody can even tell what it says and it can't even be seen
[01:36.400 --> 01:38.120]  from the U.S. Embassy.
[01:38.120 --> 01:39.120]  Well done, mate.
[01:39.120 --> 01:40.120]  Bravo.
[01:40.120 --> 01:45.080]  It's about as giant as the size of these anti-Trump protests in Regent's Park and outside Blenheim
[01:45.080 --> 01:46.080]  Palace.
[01:46.080 --> 01:50.440]  A downing street where one person showed up and asked where everyone else was.
[01:50.440 --> 01:55.560]  It was about as loud as the sound coming out of this protest as pathetic plastic whistle.
[01:55.560 --> 01:56.560]  You want to keep them up, won't you?
[01:56.560 --> 01:57.560]  Yeah.
[01:57.560 --> 02:02.560]  You need to be a bit nicer than that.
[02:02.560 --> 02:07.000]  The carnival about to begin, folks.
[02:07.000 --> 02:09.400]  Believe me, it's going to be huge.
[02:09.400 --> 02:10.400]  I don't believe you.
[02:10.400 --> 02:14.440]  Protesters in the U.K. have rallied to make Green Day's 2004 hit song American Idiot top
[02:14.440 --> 02:17.200]  singles charts ahead of President Trump's first official visit.
[02:17.200 --> 02:18.880]  American Idiot lyrics analysis.
[02:18.880 --> 02:21.320]  And can you hear the sound of hysteria?
[02:21.320 --> 02:23.240]  One nation controlled by the media.
[02:23.240 --> 02:26.080]  Yeah, sounds like those lyrics were written by Trump.
[02:26.080 --> 02:31.040]  So you got a song to number one that talks about a hysterical media controlling the nation
[02:31.040 --> 02:32.280]  with propaganda.
[02:32.280 --> 02:36.680]  Which is Trump's main talking point at every single rally he attends.
[02:36.680 --> 02:38.040]  The dishonest media.
[02:38.040 --> 02:39.040]  Fake news.
[02:39.040 --> 02:40.440]  Well done, idiots.
[02:40.440 --> 02:44.960]  Crappy U.K. company tries to get free publicity with anti-Trump virtue signaling.
[02:44.960 --> 02:45.960]  Backfires horribly.
[02:45.960 --> 02:48.760]  We can make a hundred of these baby Trump U.K. visit balloons.
[02:48.760 --> 02:49.760]  Will you buy them?
[02:49.760 --> 02:53.960]  Judging by the responses to this tweet, no one's buying anything from you ever again.
[02:53.960 --> 02:57.040]  So why are you all protesting Trump's visit to the U.K.?
[02:57.040 --> 02:59.120]  Because I'm literally a communist.
[02:59.120 --> 03:00.120]  Oh, OK.
[03:00.120 --> 03:01.120]  That makes sense.
[03:01.120 --> 03:03.680]  Did you find Obama deporting three million people unconscionable?
[03:03.680 --> 03:04.680]  Yes.
[03:04.680 --> 03:05.680]  You've been put up many families.
[03:05.680 --> 03:06.680]  Yes, I did.
[03:06.680 --> 03:07.680]  And that's why I also protested.
[03:07.680 --> 03:08.680]  And that's why I also protested.
[03:08.680 --> 03:09.680]  And that's why I also protested.
[03:09.680 --> 03:10.680]  And that's why I also protested.
[03:10.680 --> 03:11.680]  And that's why I also protested.
[03:11.680 --> 03:12.680]  And that's why I also protested.
[03:12.680 --> 03:13.680]  And that's why I also protested.
[03:13.680 --> 03:14.680]  Where was your protest march against Obama in this country as well?
[03:14.680 --> 03:15.680]  Where was your protest march against Obama?
[03:15.680 --> 03:16.680]  And you found that unconscionable too.
[03:16.680 --> 03:17.680]  Where was the march?
[03:17.680 --> 03:20.680]  Because that's why, and that's why I...
[03:20.680 --> 03:21.680]  And that's why, and that's why...
[03:21.680 --> 03:22.680]  I'm literally a communist.
[03:22.680 --> 03:24.500]  Are you protesting because Trump's a misogynist?
[03:24.500 --> 03:27.280]  Because he said, grab them by the pussy 13 years ago.
[03:27.280 --> 03:28.280]  Right.
[03:28.280 --> 03:32.400]  So you must've been up in arms about the arrival of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to the
[03:32.400 --> 03:33.440]  U.K. on a state visit.
[03:33.440 --> 03:39.260]  A man who oversees a regime under which women need male guardian approval to travel or open
[03:39.260 --> 03:40.260]  a bank account.
[03:40.260 --> 03:44.960]  A regime under which women are imprisoned and tortured for not wearing a hijab, a regime
[03:44.960 --> 03:50.960]  which is ranked 141 out of 144 for women's rights.
[03:50.960 --> 03:54.960]  A man who oversees a regime that bombs women and children in Yemen.
[03:54.960 --> 03:57.960]  You must have packed the streets for his arrival, right?
[03:57.960 --> 04:03.960]  Are you protesting because you think Trump's anti-media rhetoric represents a threat to the free press?
[04:03.960 --> 04:09.960]  Right, so you must have been up in arms about the arrival of Turkish President Erdogan to the UK on a state visit.
[04:09.960 --> 04:15.960]  An Islamist dictator who oversees a regime that imprisons more journalists than any other country.
[04:15.960 --> 04:21.960]  A man who, before he even left London on his last visit, called those imprisoned journalists terrorists.
[04:21.960 --> 04:27.960]  A man who has eliminated over 100 media outlets by decree since 2016.
[04:27.960 --> 04:31.960]  A man whose goons beat up protesters in Washington DC.
[04:31.960 --> 04:35.960]  You must have packed the streets for his arrival, right?
[04:35.960 --> 04:40.960]  Are you protesting because you think Trump's literally Hitler is trying to impose it?
[04:40.960 --> 04:43.960]  Alright, that's Paul Joseph Watson.
[04:43.960 --> 04:46.960]  He's going to be joining us at 12.30 Central.
[04:46.960 --> 05:06.960]  I can sense the supreme victory. We'll be right back.
[05:16.960 --> 05:20.960]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[05:20.960 --> 05:26.960]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity and pH.
[05:26.960 --> 05:32.960]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[05:32.960 --> 05:36.960]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter.
[05:36.960 --> 05:43.960]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[05:43.960 --> 05:48.960]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water.
[05:48.960 --> 05:54.960]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[05:54.960 --> 06:21.960]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[06:21.960 --> 06:27.960]  It is Friday, July 13th, 2018. This is the Alex Jones show.
[06:27.960 --> 06:30.960]  Filling in for Alex Jones, I am Owen Schreuer.
[06:30.960 --> 06:38.960]  And I can sense supreme victory.
[06:38.960 --> 06:42.960]  I don't know about you, but I wanted a worldwide revolution.
[06:42.960 --> 06:49.960]  I don't know about you, but I wanted a revolution against the corruption in American politics.
[06:49.960 --> 06:55.960]  And here we are smack dab in the middle of our revolution.
[06:55.960 --> 07:00.960]  And you see the minions in the streets. You see the sheeple in the streets.
[07:00.960 --> 07:06.960]  You see the lap dogs and the mockingbird media on television.
[07:06.960 --> 07:13.960]  You see the Democrat Party just outright lying.
[07:13.960 --> 07:22.960]  Truly incredible as you see President Trump standing up for the United States of America to NATO.
[07:22.960 --> 07:28.960]  Telling Theresa May, you have destroyed your country with immigration.
[07:28.960 --> 07:34.960]  Yes, President Trump is the man we elected.
[07:34.960 --> 07:43.960]  And he has now been, I think, is he with the Queen now, guys? Do we have that footage?
[07:43.960 --> 07:48.960]  He's arriving in London either way.
[07:48.960 --> 07:56.960]  There is the footage right there. President Trump is getting out of the car and he is set to meet with the Queen.
[07:56.960 --> 07:59.960]  In fact, this is happening. Is this live right now, guys?
[07:59.960 --> 08:02.960]  Will President Trump kiss the Queen?
[08:02.960 --> 08:06.960]  Will Trump kiss a goblin?
[08:06.960 --> 08:09.960]  It does not appear so.
[08:09.960 --> 08:21.960]  We also have Rod Rosenstein announcing a special, what did he call it guys, a special law announcement or something?
[08:21.960 --> 08:25.960]  So Rosenstein is about to hold a press conference today.
[08:25.960 --> 08:38.960]  Boy, I wonder if this has anything to do with his testimony where he got grilled and seared and then Peter Stroke's testimony where he got grilled and seared.
[08:38.960 --> 08:47.960]  And I've got tons of clips that we're going to get to from the Peter Stroke testimony.
[08:47.960 --> 08:49.960]  Truly incredible stuff.
[08:49.960 --> 08:56.960]  The story is at infowars.com, the evil face of the deep state, the disturbing faces of Peter Stroke.
[08:56.960 --> 08:58.960]  Now, this is actually quite disturbing.
[08:58.960 --> 09:08.960]  I mean, I guess you could probably take any broadcast that we do here and get funny faces and then we make funny faces.
[09:08.960 --> 09:14.960]  This is like beyond just the funny face that you might capture from anybody doing a live broadcast.
[09:14.960 --> 09:18.960]  This is just strange.
[09:18.960 --> 09:21.960]  This is like, what is this guy?
[09:21.960 --> 09:22.960]  And oh, yeah.
[09:22.960 --> 09:23.960]  Oh, no.
[09:23.960 --> 09:33.960]  And there's this weird, there's this weird gift where he like does like a little shimmy and has like this little wicked smile and he like puckers his lips or something.
[09:33.960 --> 09:34.960]  Everybody here.
[09:34.960 --> 09:39.960]  Look, the overall story for me today.
[09:39.960 --> 09:45.960]  And I can equate almost all of the news on the desk that I have here today is to victory.
[09:45.960 --> 09:52.960]  Victory in our revolutionary war for truth, victory in our revolutionary war for justice.
[09:52.960 --> 09:58.960]  And while we're not to the finish line, we are just plowing forward right now.
[09:58.960 --> 10:06.960]  So if you're watching the Peter Stroke testimony yesterday, which we're going to have all the clips on on the other side.
[10:06.960 --> 10:10.960]  You're seeing how pathetic these people really are.
[10:10.960 --> 10:12.960]  So there's two dynamics happening.
[10:12.960 --> 10:22.960]  The Democrats are being exposed for how partisan and pathetic they are where they, they go back to Russia, they go back to kids in cages at the stroke testimony yesterday.
[10:22.960 --> 10:30.960]  So just total insane behavior, interrupting the Republicans during their time.
[10:30.960 --> 10:36.960]  Just like, you know, a first grader that can't behave themselves that has to go sit in the back of the room or something.
[10:36.960 --> 10:39.960]  That's what the Democrat Party has now become.
[10:39.960 --> 10:54.960]  But then you think about Peter Stroke and you think this guy was an FBI agent, this nitwit, this FOP, this nothing, this nobody, this freak show.
[10:54.960 --> 10:57.960]  This is the guy.
[10:57.960 --> 11:04.960]  This is the guy at the FBI who's investigating Hillary Clinton's email and private server.
[11:04.960 --> 11:11.960]  This is the guy sleeping around with Lisa Page, who's on the Mueller team investigating the Russia probe.
[11:11.960 --> 11:15.960]  This is the guy saying he's going to stop the president.
[11:15.960 --> 11:18.960]  No wonder President Trump has no fear of these people.
[11:18.960 --> 11:21.960]  They're a bunch of losers.
[11:21.960 --> 11:24.960]  They are a bunch of ninnies.
[11:24.960 --> 11:25.960]  Think about it.
[11:25.960 --> 11:30.960]  Nancy Pelosi, Maxine Waters, Chuck Schumer, Peter Stroke, you put these people in a room.
[11:30.960 --> 11:38.960]  They can't even hold a candle to Donald Trump.
[11:38.960 --> 11:43.960]  And they're all being exposed right now.
[11:43.960 --> 11:50.960]  And so everything you're seeing is our revolutionary war taking its foothold.
[11:50.960 --> 11:51.960]  That's what this is.
[11:51.960 --> 11:55.960]  You're going to have President Trump for two more years, probably six.
[11:55.960 --> 11:59.960]  Think about that.
[11:59.960 --> 12:01.960]  Another Supreme Court justice.
[12:01.960 --> 12:07.960]  Can you imagine the protest for that?
[12:07.960 --> 12:16.960]  So all of the news today, I can equate to victory.
[12:16.960 --> 12:28.960]  Now specifically, you look at these headlines from Yahoo fighting fake news with the law from Associated Free Press, the online battle for the truth.
[12:28.960 --> 12:36.960]  And yesterday, YouTube trying to censor fake news somehow Info Wars still exists.
[12:36.960 --> 12:40.960]  The Guardian, Hillary Clinton attacks Trump for all out war on truth facts and reason.
[12:40.960 --> 12:46.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you the translation for all of these headlines.
[12:46.960 --> 12:51.960]  Info Wars is winning and we don't know what to do.
[12:51.960 --> 12:56.960]  Info Wars news is completely accurate and we keep being wrong and we don't know what to do.
[12:56.960 --> 12:58.960]  We've tried to call them fake news.
[12:58.960 --> 12:59.960]  We've tried to call them racist.
[12:59.960 --> 13:01.960]  We filed a bunch of frivolous lawsuits.
[13:01.960 --> 13:05.960]  We've made a bunch of false claims and they keep winning.
[13:05.960 --> 13:08.960]  This is not how we made the world to operate.
[13:08.960 --> 13:11.960]  People aren't allowed to have choice when it comes to news.
[13:11.960 --> 13:15.960]  No, if we tell them it's fake news, it's fake news.
[13:15.960 --> 13:20.960]  If we tell them there was a ship sunk in the Gulf of Tonkin, we're going to war.
[13:20.960 --> 13:24.960]  If we tell them there was a lone shooter that killed JFK, they buy it.
[13:24.960 --> 13:26.960]  What's going on here?
[13:26.960 --> 13:34.960]  Well, the American people woke up and we just started to smell the coffee
[13:34.960 --> 13:40.960]  just in the nick of time to get Donald Trump elected, save us from Hillary Clinton,
[13:40.960 --> 13:46.960]  and now get victory after victory after victory after victory after victory after victory.
[13:46.960 --> 13:51.960]  Feds collect record individual income taxes through June.
[13:51.960 --> 13:56.960]  Okay, let's see. How many records has President Trump had in a year and a half?
[13:56.960 --> 13:58.960]  Record low unemployment.
[13:58.960 --> 14:00.960]  Record low black unemployment.
[14:00.960 --> 14:03.960]  Record low Latino unemployment.
[14:03.960 --> 14:05.960]  Record low female unemployment.
[14:05.960 --> 14:09.960]  Record number of females in his administration.
[14:09.960 --> 14:13.960]  How many different records has he hit on the jobs market?
[14:13.960 --> 14:15.960]  Record number of jobs growth.
[14:15.960 --> 14:17.960]  Record number GDP growth.
[14:17.960 --> 14:24.960]  Record number stocks market. Just records and records and records and just rewriting the record book.
[14:24.960 --> 14:26.960]  President Donald Trump.
[14:26.960 --> 14:32.960]  And what does the corporate media tell you?
[14:32.960 --> 14:36.960]  Russian hacking.
[14:36.960 --> 14:41.960]  Russian hacking is responsible for your own freedom and your own prosperity.
[14:41.960 --> 14:46.960]  And they can't defeat info wars, so they keep going back to the fake news.
[14:46.960 --> 14:49.960]  So Rod Rosenstein is now having a live press conference.
[14:49.960 --> 14:52.960]  Guys, let's pause that. We're going to a break now.
[14:52.960 --> 14:55.960]  We're going to carry that on the other side. We'll get to the Peter Stroke clips.

[20:36.960 --> 20:38.960]  We're taking America back.
[20:38.960 --> 20:45.960]  That's why the deep state's panicking and the signs are everywhere, ladies and gentlemen.
[20:45.960 --> 20:47.960]  Quite a feeling.
[20:47.960 --> 20:52.960]  Quite a sight to behold.
[20:52.960 --> 20:58.960]  And it's really amazing that so many people are missing out on this entirely.
[20:58.960 --> 21:00.960]  Not us, not you.

[21:04.960 --> 21:08.960]  As patriots that stood up for what's right.

[21:13.960 --> 21:15.960]  Guaranteed.
[21:15.960 --> 21:17.960]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[21:17.960 --> 21:19.960]  Owen Troyer filling in for Alex today.
[21:19.960 --> 21:21.960]  We've got Rod Rosenstein.
[21:21.960 --> 21:30.960]  The swamp creature goblin that a Luke Anon has said has ties to Seth Rich.
[21:30.960 --> 21:33.960]  And I will just leave it at that.
[21:33.960 --> 21:40.960]  You can look at Jack Berkman's press conference and interview with us that I have clips of on the Alex Jones channel on YouTube.
[21:40.960 --> 21:45.960]  But regardless, he has called, I guess, some emergency last second press conference.
[21:45.960 --> 21:47.960]  Nobody seems to know why.
[21:47.960 --> 21:52.960]  But it's President Rod Rosenstein, ladies and gentlemen, the president of the state, unelected.
[21:52.960 --> 21:55.960]  He'll bring America down with Peter's stroke and Lisa Page.
[21:55.960 --> 22:00.960]  Let's go to the fake president, Rod Rosenstein.
[22:00.960 --> 22:03.960]  Good afternoon.
[22:03.960 --> 22:05.960]  Today, a grand jury in the district.
[22:05.960 --> 22:07.960]  I don't even know how to work a microphone.
[22:07.960 --> 22:09.960]  I'm the department of justice.
[22:09.960 --> 22:18.960]  I'm the department of justice.
[22:18.960 --> 22:19.960]  Oh, my gosh.
[22:19.960 --> 22:20.960]  Okay.
[22:20.960 --> 22:21.960]  Okay.
[22:21.960 --> 22:22.960]  Now I know what's going on.
[22:22.960 --> 22:28.960]  The defendants are charged with conspiring to hack into computers, steal documents, and release those documents.
[22:28.960 --> 22:29.960]  All right.
[22:29.960 --> 22:30.960]  All right.
[22:30.960 --> 22:31.960]  Pause it.
[22:31.960 --> 22:32.960]  Pause it.
[22:32.960 --> 22:33.960]  Pause it.
[22:33.960 --> 22:34.960]  Pause it.
[22:34.960 --> 22:35.960]  Pause it.
[22:35.960 --> 22:36.960]  Pause it.
[22:36.960 --> 22:37.960]  Pause it.
[22:37.960 --> 22:38.960]  Pause it.
[22:38.960 --> 22:39.960]  All right.
[22:39.960 --> 22:40.960]  You guys tried to hear the c-span audio.
[22:40.960 --> 22:41.960]  It's all right.
[22:41.960 --> 22:43.960]  We're just wargaming here live on air.
[22:43.960 --> 22:45.960]  Because I know what he's about to say.
[22:45.960 --> 22:47.960]  The c-span is better.
[22:47.960 --> 22:48.960]  Let's just go live to c-span.
[22:48.960 --> 22:50.960]  Because I know what he's going to say here.
[22:50.960 --> 22:51.960]  And this audio is bothering me.
[22:51.960 --> 22:53.960]  So let's just go live to c-span.
[22:53.960 --> 23:00.960]  There's no allegation that the conspiracy changed the vote count or affected any election result.
[23:00.960 --> 23:03.960]  The special counsel's investigation is ongoing.
[23:03.960 --> 23:07.960]  There will be no comments, the special counsel, at this time.
[23:07.960 --> 23:13.520]  Assistant Attorney General John DeMers is here with me today because we intend to transition
[23:13.520 --> 23:19.040]  responsibility for this indictment to the Justice Department's National Security Division
[23:19.040 --> 23:23.600]  while we await the apprehension of the defendants.
[23:23.600 --> 23:26.880]  Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General Ed O'Callaghan is also with me and he's been
[23:26.880 --> 23:30.480]  assisting in managing the special counsel investigation.
[23:30.480 --> 23:38.320]  I want to caution you, the people who speculate about federal investigations usually do not
[23:38.320 --> 23:43.400]  know all of the relevant facts.
[23:43.400 --> 23:48.920]  We do not try cases on television or in congressional hearings.
[23:48.920 --> 23:49.920]  Most of them are-
[23:49.920 --> 23:51.040]  Alright, just bring him down for a second.
[23:51.040 --> 23:53.640]  But now he's like making an excuse for why they won't give you answers.
[23:53.640 --> 23:56.200]  So this is really incredible what's happening right now.
[23:56.200 --> 24:02.480]  They're bringing back up the Mueller indictments of the Russians and they assume that the American
[24:02.480 --> 24:08.200]  public is so stupid they're not even going to know the full story which is that the Russians
[24:08.200 --> 24:09.200]  already showed up.
[24:09.200 --> 24:13.440]  So now they're apparently saying the military, the Russian military is behind it.
[24:13.440 --> 24:17.120]  Folks, they're going full panic right now.
[24:17.120 --> 24:19.280]  This is unbelievable.
[24:19.280 --> 24:23.480]  They think people are going to buy this and Trump's about to meet with Putin.
[24:23.480 --> 24:30.000]  Oh, this is so glorious, let's go back to the Rosenstein.
[24:30.000 --> 24:37.880]  We follow the rule of law, which means that we follow procedures and we reserve judgment.
[24:37.880 --> 24:43.680]  We complete our investigations and we evaluate all of the relevant evidence before we reach
[24:43.680 --> 24:44.680]  any conclusion.
[24:44.680 --> 24:45.680]  Unless it's Hillary Clinton.
[24:45.680 --> 24:51.280]  That is how the American people expect their department of justice to operate and that
[24:51.280 --> 24:54.160]  is how our department is going to operate.
[24:54.160 --> 25:02.320]  In our justice system, everyone who's charged with a crime is presumed innocent unless and
[25:02.320 --> 25:04.400]  until proven guilty.
[25:04.400 --> 25:05.400]  Unless you're Trump.
[25:05.400 --> 25:06.400]  It should go without saying.
[25:06.400 --> 25:13.360]  So Hillary always innocent even when guilty, Trump always guilty even when innocent.
[25:13.360 --> 25:18.440]  The indictment was returned today because prosecutors determined that the evidence was sufficient
[25:18.440 --> 25:20.760]  to present these allegations to a federal court.
[25:20.760 --> 25:24.480]  What is this 1984 universe that I'm living in?
[25:24.480 --> 25:31.160]  It's based solely on the facts, the law, and the Department of Justice policy.
[25:31.160 --> 25:33.320]  I have nothing left but laughter for this madness.
[25:33.320 --> 25:38.480]  All these allegations earlier this week, the president is fully aware of the department's
[25:38.480 --> 25:39.480]  actions today.
[25:39.480 --> 25:43.560]  So they're trying to sully President Trump's meeting with Putin coming up next week on
[25:43.560 --> 25:44.560]  Monday.
[25:44.560 --> 25:45.560]  That's what they're trying to do right here.
[25:45.560 --> 25:47.680]  No, don't you meet with Putin.
[25:47.680 --> 25:48.680]  They were trying to hack the election.
[25:48.680 --> 25:54.800]  And of course, the whole thing is a joke because they're sitting here with this false notion
[25:54.800 --> 25:57.080]  that Trump is actually working for Putin.
[25:57.080 --> 26:01.840]  Do you see how mad this entire thing is?
[26:01.840 --> 26:08.360]  So are they going to go full jump the shark and say the Russian military hacked the United
[26:08.360 --> 26:10.640]  States election for Donald Trump to win?
[26:10.640 --> 26:12.960]  Is that what they're trying to do here?
[26:12.960 --> 26:18.840]  Because that, I mean, if they're real in their diagnosis of the election being a Russian
[26:18.840 --> 26:22.680]  hack job, then you would assume they have to retreat back to that stance.
[26:22.680 --> 26:28.280]  But they know it's such a lunatic thing that they're not going to do it.
[26:28.280 --> 26:32.040]  And so now they're just going to say, oh, the Russian military hacked Trump, you can't
[26:32.040 --> 26:33.040]  meet with Putin.
[26:33.040 --> 26:34.040]  Don't go meet with Putin.
[26:34.040 --> 26:35.040]  They're hacking us.
[26:35.040 --> 26:36.040]  They're our enemy.
[26:36.040 --> 26:42.840]  Even though they're telling Trump he is Putin's puppet, this is, I mean, I have nothing
[26:42.840 --> 26:47.840]  left but just laughter for this hysteria.
[26:47.840 --> 26:54.920]  This lunatic fringe society that the deep state is trying to foist upon us here.
[26:54.920 --> 26:56.440]  Trump colluded with Russia.
[26:56.440 --> 27:01.920]  Let's go back to Rosenstein.
[27:01.920 --> 27:05.760]  The indictment was returned today because prosecutors determined that the evidence was
[27:05.760 --> 27:11.240]  sufficient to present these allegations to a federal grand jury.
[27:11.240 --> 27:19.080]  Our analysis is based solely on the facts, the law, and Department of Justice policies.
[27:19.080 --> 27:24.440]  I briefed President Trump about these allegations earlier this week.
[27:24.440 --> 27:29.160]  The President is fully aware of the department's actions today.
[27:29.160 --> 27:33.840]  On my remarks, I have not identified the victims.
[27:33.840 --> 27:40.160]  When we confront foreign interference in American elections, it's important for us to avoid
[27:40.160 --> 27:50.680]  thinking politically as Republicans or Democrats, and instead to think patriotically as Americans.
[27:50.680 --> 27:56.200]  Our response must not depend on which side was victimized.
[27:56.200 --> 27:58.360]  The Internet allows foreign adversaries.
[27:58.360 --> 28:03.120]  This is unbelievable, but here, but pause it, or just pull it down.
[28:03.120 --> 28:07.600]  Every claim they're making is the Russians hacked the DCCC, the Russians hacked the DNC,
[28:07.600 --> 28:09.880]  the Russians hacked the Hillary campaign.
[28:09.880 --> 28:13.080]  So here he is saying, oh, it's not about the campaign or which side or anything.
[28:13.080 --> 28:15.760]  This whole, it's, that's what it's been from the beginning.
[28:15.760 --> 28:18.000]  This whole thing started because of Trump-Russia collusion.
[28:18.000 --> 28:21.960]  I mean, they're trying to pull the wall over your eyes.
[28:21.960 --> 28:25.200]  This is unbelievable.
[28:25.200 --> 28:26.200]  So what is next?
[28:26.200 --> 28:34.560]  I mean, nobody believes this crap, no one.
[28:34.560 --> 28:37.080]  Are you having fun yet or what?
[28:37.080 --> 28:38.280]  Let's go.
[28:38.280 --> 28:40.400]  It's moving downhill.
[28:40.400 --> 28:42.400]  It just keeps picking up more momentum.
[28:42.400 --> 28:47.320]  Oh, but don't worry, it's going to be smashed when it gets to the bottom.
[28:47.320 --> 28:48.840]  Is it Trump-Russia collusion?
[28:48.840 --> 28:50.440]  Is it Russian hacking?
[28:50.440 --> 28:52.040]  What happened to Seth Rich?
[28:52.040 --> 28:54.200]  Who is Rod Rosenstein?
[28:54.200 --> 28:59.560]  Oh, boy, they are in panic mode right now.
[28:59.560 --> 29:01.880]  Want revenge on the common housefly?
[29:01.880 --> 29:07.560]  Well, after 10,000 years, someone has finally come up with a better way, the bug assault,
[29:07.560 --> 29:13.440]  a miniaturized shotgun, which utilizes ordinary table salt as ammunition, non-toxic and no
[29:13.440 --> 29:14.680]  batteries required.
[29:14.680 --> 29:15.680]  So much fun.

[33:27.800 --> 33:29.760]  This news breaking right now is so crazy.
[33:29.760 --> 33:32.200]  I'm going to have to take some brain force so I can cover it accurately.
[33:32.200 --> 33:35.880]  I need the crew to bring me some brain force, please does.
[33:35.880 --> 33:38.000]  I'm telling you, I don't think there is no one else.
[33:38.000 --> 33:40.440]  I don't think that's going to tell you what's going on here, folks.
[33:40.440 --> 33:41.440]  Thank you.
[33:41.440 --> 33:49.320]  Oh, a fresh brain force to look at that freshly sealed 50% off right now at info wars store
[33:49.320 --> 33:50.320]  dot com.
[33:50.320 --> 33:53.400]  So I'm about to break all this down, but I'm telling you, I just wanted to take some
[33:53.400 --> 33:59.320]  brain force here to make sure that I'm fully focused and I can do this with focus and accuracy
[33:59.320 --> 34:02.000]  here because I don't know if there's anywhere.
[34:02.000 --> 34:07.200]  I mean, there's, there's plenty of places, but with the reach of info wars and with the
[34:07.200 --> 34:14.280]  the left watching us monitoring everything we do, I just want to be perfectly coherent
[34:14.280 --> 34:15.280]  with this.
[34:15.280 --> 34:19.920]  I'm going to, I'm going to knock down to brain force here real quick.
[34:19.920 --> 34:20.920]  Okay.
[34:20.920 --> 34:29.320]  Thank you to the crew for bringing me that brain force 50% off right now at info wars
[34:29.320 --> 34:30.320]  store dot com.
[34:30.320 --> 34:31.520]  Check out all the five star ratings for yourself.
[34:31.520 --> 34:34.200]  Okay.
[34:34.200 --> 34:39.160]  This is truly wacky wild stuff that's happening right here.
[34:39.160 --> 34:46.240]  Rod Rosenstein calls a press conference to best of my knowledge and everyone here in
[34:46.240 --> 34:49.360]  the last like 12 hours.
[34:49.360 --> 34:50.960]  We've got it still queued up.
[34:50.960 --> 34:53.120]  We'll go back to it here in a moment.
[34:53.120 --> 34:57.800]  He calls a press conference and he announces that Robert Mueller has indicted 12 Russian
[34:57.800 --> 35:03.200]  officers and now they're trying to link this to essentially the Russian military is what
[35:03.200 --> 35:10.640]  they're saying, but there's some weird shenanigans happening with this deal.
[35:10.640 --> 35:16.880]  And this is why I'm just trying to stay focused and report this accurately because it's so
[35:16.880 --> 35:20.640]  it's so twilight zone out there.
[35:20.640 --> 35:26.040]  It's almost like I can't even believe what I'm reporting even though I know it's true.
[35:26.040 --> 35:33.440]  So this headline Mueller indides 12 Russian officers for hacking Dems in 2016 guys pull
[35:33.440 --> 35:36.960]  up drudge report so I can see what drudge report headline is right now.
[35:36.960 --> 35:40.680]  And is it this daily beast story that I have?
[35:40.680 --> 35:42.160]  Is that a link to the daily beast?
[35:42.160 --> 35:43.160]  Okay.
[35:43.160 --> 35:49.540]  So the drudge headline Russian military charged with hacking DNC Hillary campaign state elections.
[35:49.540 --> 35:54.600]  So they're moving forward now with the Russian hacking claim.
[35:54.600 --> 35:56.160]  Okay.
[35:56.160 --> 35:57.160]  Thank you.
[35:57.160 --> 35:58.160]  So now it's linking to yahoo.
[35:58.160 --> 36:01.560]  So there's a new story on yahoo from the Associated Press.
[36:01.560 --> 36:07.240]  But okay, so I'm just trying to focus here.
[36:07.240 --> 36:11.160]  Let's rewind the clocks back.
[36:11.160 --> 36:12.160]  What was it?
[36:12.160 --> 36:17.120]  Five, six months, maybe more than that.
[36:17.120 --> 36:22.520]  Mueller indides the 12 Russians and the quote unquote Russian entities, which were essentially
[36:22.520 --> 36:29.760]  these agencies that was running the quote unquote social media troll farms, which by
[36:29.760 --> 36:34.160]  their own admission and even roses seen in this most recent press conference admit that
[36:34.160 --> 36:41.200]  it was going both ways pro Hillary and pro Trump anti Hillary and anti Trump.
[36:41.200 --> 36:49.840]  So there was no real agenda or plan to manipulate the elections more to just so discord in the
[36:49.840 --> 36:53.360]  United States, which the Russians don't need to do the Democrats are great at that Obama
[36:53.360 --> 36:55.120]  mastered that for eight years.
[36:55.120 --> 36:56.120]  But I'm getting off track.
[36:56.120 --> 36:57.120]  Okay.
[36:57.120 --> 37:00.520]  So Mueller indicts those Russians months ago.
[37:00.520 --> 37:02.320]  It's a huge news story.
[37:02.320 --> 37:06.360]  The media celebrates like this is the be all end all we got them.
[37:06.360 --> 37:08.280]  And then what happens?
[37:08.280 --> 37:10.280]  Well they really did the indictments for the headlines.
[37:10.280 --> 37:12.320]  They weren't expecting this to actually reach a court.
[37:12.320 --> 37:17.480]  They weren't expecting the Russians to show up and then oops, the Russians did show up
[37:17.480 --> 37:22.120]  for court and the lawyers representing them demanded discovery.
[37:22.120 --> 37:23.520]  What did Robert Mueller do?
[37:23.520 --> 37:24.680]  He balked.
[37:24.680 --> 37:25.880]  He walked away.
[37:25.880 --> 37:30.200]  He then said that he didn't have enough evidence yet so that he couldn't show up in court, even
[37:30.200 --> 37:33.280]  though you don't indict someone until you have all the evidence.
[37:33.280 --> 37:34.680]  So you know he's lying about that.
[37:34.680 --> 37:36.720]  He wasn't expecting the Russians to show up.
[37:36.720 --> 37:38.360]  So what happens?
[37:38.360 --> 37:44.800]  They just leave that case out there and because that blows up in their face, they retreat
[37:44.800 --> 37:51.280]  and then they re-indite the same Russians, leave out the agencies quote-unquote entities
[37:51.280 --> 37:55.800]  and then bring in different claims of Russian government hacking, military hacking with
[37:55.800 --> 38:03.000]  specific sites and they basically say we're relaunching a whole new lawsuit because we
[38:03.000 --> 38:04.600]  blew the last one.
[38:04.600 --> 38:08.320]  So we're going to launch a whole new indictment campaign against these Russians.
[38:08.320 --> 38:13.400]  Now they're going to have to re-lawyer up and we'll see what they do next.
[38:13.400 --> 38:20.080]  But this is just another fake victory, Tokyo Rose Baghdad Bob of the deep state trying to
[38:20.080 --> 38:24.240]  tell people we got the Russians, don't lose faith, Trump's not legitimate.
[38:24.240 --> 38:25.240]  It's all fake.
[38:25.240 --> 38:26.240]  It's all Russian.
[38:26.240 --> 38:28.760]  No, you're all fake.
[38:28.760 --> 38:32.640]  You are the ones that colluded with Russia, with Uranium One, with payments for Bill
[38:32.640 --> 38:36.720]  Clinton, with the fake Russian dossier.
[38:36.720 --> 38:41.680]  You've got egg all over your face and you're pointing at everyone else and saying, ha ha,
[38:41.680 --> 38:45.720]  look at the egg on your face when you know damn well it's all over your own.
[38:45.720 --> 38:51.600]  And so here's Rod Rosenstein in a fake victory for the deep state saying we're indicting
[38:51.600 --> 38:56.240]  these 12 Russians that they already indicted, who already showed up in court and who Mueller
[38:56.240 --> 38:57.920]  balked at.
[38:57.920 --> 39:01.520]  Let's go back to Rosenstein.
[39:01.520 --> 39:08.280]  The internet allows foreign adversaries to attack America in new and unexpected ways.
[39:08.280 --> 39:13.240]  Free and fair elections are always hard fought and contentious.
[39:13.240 --> 39:18.160]  There will always be adversaries who seek to exacerbate our divisions.
[39:18.160 --> 39:19.160]  Like the Democrats.
[39:19.160 --> 39:21.480]  Try to confuse, divide and conquer us.
[39:21.480 --> 39:22.480]  Democrats.
[39:22.480 --> 39:30.280]  So long as we are united in our commitment to the values enshrined in the Constitution,
[39:30.280 --> 39:31.280]  they will not succeed.
[39:31.280 --> 39:32.280]  A partisan warfare.
[39:32.280 --> 39:48.360]  See, I'm telling you, oh man, I'll tell you, I have faith in the American people that they're
[39:48.360 --> 39:52.120]  going to see through this.
[39:52.120 --> 40:00.360]  This SOB is sitting here saying that Russia is trying to sow discord and contentiousness
[40:00.360 --> 40:07.440]  in this country as it's his own fake investigation, his own fake press conference.
[40:07.440 --> 40:13.760]  He and Mueller's fake indictments that are doing just that.
[40:13.760 --> 40:20.880]  The unmitigated nerve of these people tells you they have some serious business that they're
[40:20.880 --> 40:23.360]  trying to divert from.
[40:23.360 --> 40:26.320]  Let's go back to the goblin.
[40:26.320 --> 40:34.520]  Modern technology does not fairly reflect the grace, dignity and unity of the American
[40:34.520 --> 40:35.520]  people.
[40:35.520 --> 40:42.920]  The blame for election interference belongs to the criminals who committed election interference.
[40:42.920 --> 40:49.160]  We need to work together to hold the perpetrators accountable, and we need to keep moving forward
[40:49.160 --> 40:56.800]  to preserve our values, protect against future interference, and defend America.
[40:56.800 --> 40:58.800]  I have time to take a few questions.
[40:58.800 --> 40:59.800]  All right.
[40:59.800 --> 41:06.200]  The timing today on the eve of the President's meeting with Putin, can you talk about that?
[41:06.200 --> 41:12.440]  And also, just today, the President described the Mueller investigation as a witch hunt.
[41:12.440 --> 41:17.760]  As I mentioned, it's a function of the collection of the facts, the evidence and the law.
[41:17.760 --> 41:19.760]  This is such BS.
[41:19.760 --> 41:24.320]  You're trying to sabotage the Trump-Putin summit, you little weasel.
[41:24.320 --> 41:29.840]  With regard to the nature of the investigation, I only comment on the evidence.
[41:29.840 --> 41:30.840]  The evidence of my...
[41:30.840 --> 41:31.840]  Bring him down.
[41:31.840 --> 41:32.840]  Bring him down.
[41:32.840 --> 41:33.840]  Because I...
[41:33.840 --> 41:35.840]  I want to...
[41:35.840 --> 41:41.280]  So are they now saying, folks, this is breaking right now, and I'm sitting here in studio.
[41:41.280 --> 41:45.440]  I haven't been able to hear the whole press conference, and I've only got one new story,
[41:45.440 --> 41:46.440]  guys.
[41:46.440 --> 41:49.160]  I'm supposed to print me other news stories on this so I can read up on this, but I'm
[41:49.160 --> 41:50.160]  trying to figure this out.
[41:50.160 --> 41:53.160]  Are they now claiming...
[41:53.160 --> 41:54.160]  So they're...
[41:54.160 --> 42:00.160]  I know that they're claiming that these Russians have hacked the DNC, the DCCCC, and the Hillary
[42:00.160 --> 42:01.160]  campaign.
[42:01.160 --> 42:02.160]  Okay.
[42:02.160 --> 42:03.640]  Well, they've always been claiming that.
[42:03.640 --> 42:07.880]  So there's nothing really new there, but are they now saying that the Russians actually
[42:07.880 --> 42:11.920]  hacked into the electronic voting machines and rigged the election?
[42:11.920 --> 42:16.000]  Are they now saying that?
[42:16.000 --> 42:19.600]  I mean, the headline on Drudge is implying that.
[42:19.600 --> 42:22.920]  I haven't heard Rosenstein say that.
[42:22.920 --> 42:30.240]  I mean, just say that frankly, but he seems to be tiptoeing around it, too.
[42:30.240 --> 42:31.520]  Okay.
[42:31.520 --> 42:32.520]  Are they now...
[42:32.520 --> 42:37.080]  Are they now going to say the election was illegitimate because Russia hacked it?
[42:37.080 --> 42:41.240]  Are they now going to go full bore with that fake news?
[42:41.240 --> 42:50.120]  All right, well, if they do, let's have a joint campaign for paper ballots again.
[42:50.120 --> 42:53.040]  I don't trust the electronic voting machine, so let's just have paper ballots.
[42:53.040 --> 42:55.640]  If you're going to claim Russia's hacking everything, let's go to paper ballots.
[42:55.640 --> 42:59.640]  Oh, but they won't do that.

[46:58.060 --> 47:16.060]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:16.060 --> 47:36.140]  all right it's clearing up to me now we're all racing around here trying to figure out what the
[47:36.140 --> 47:42.060]  hell's going on i want to correct something i said in the last segment it is not the same russians
[47:42.060 --> 47:52.140]  it is not the same russians this is a new group of russians the news is so crazy
[47:56.300 --> 48:02.540]  story is still the same because the the original indictments that i have right here
[48:04.140 --> 48:10.220]  that were filed in the district of columbia i don't see a date on this okay yeah there it
[48:10.220 --> 48:16.940]  is filed in february so this is the original mewler russia indictment that they celebrated that was
[48:16.940 --> 48:26.780]  filed in february and these russians the quote unquote troll farms these russians were indicted
[48:26.780 --> 48:31.580]  by mewler showed up in court demanded discovery mewler balk walked away and you never heard
[48:31.580 --> 48:39.500]  anything more from this case at all okay now again i inaccurately reported in the last segment
[48:39.500 --> 48:44.220]  that it was the same 12 russians in the new indictments that is not true i now have the
[48:44.220 --> 48:50.300]  indictment in front of me and it is 12 totally different russians now briefing through this
[48:50.300 --> 48:56.460]  in the break is pretty much exactly what you would expect they're claiming that the russian
[48:56.460 --> 49:04.940]  military with these 12 people engaged in hacking us elections hacking the democrats so so so so
[49:04.940 --> 49:11.820]  so they don't mention anything to my knowledge in going through this briefly about any hacking of
[49:11.820 --> 49:16.060]  republicans or attempted happening hacking of republicans so i'm not sure if that's because
[49:16.060 --> 49:23.020]  none of that happened or if they were unable to do so but they're saying they hacked the dnc the
[49:23.020 --> 49:30.060]  d triple c the hillary campaign and working with wiki leaks dc leaks and goose for 2.0 they staged
[49:30.060 --> 49:37.580]  the release of said documents to the public to quote interfere in the united states elections
[49:38.780 --> 49:49.740]  now let's say let's say that that is accurate information let's take this report for what it
[49:49.740 --> 50:01.260]  is and say that's accurate information well i would say thank you russia how about you why
[50:01.260 --> 50:11.020]  would the documents have affected the election so much unless it exposed corruption from inside
[50:11.020 --> 50:20.220]  the democrat party and the hillary clinton campaign which it did now whether you believe these indictments
[50:20.220 --> 50:29.100]  are real or not and these people were behind the hacking it doesn't matter because the documents
[50:29.100 --> 50:34.780]  got out we read them we saw the emails we know who hillary is we know who the democrats are
[50:34.780 --> 50:43.260]  are that doesn't change but they think they can divert the attention off of all of their corruption
[50:44.540 --> 50:48.460]  by crying russian collusion trumps russian trump never won the presidency
[50:49.900 --> 50:54.300]  even though they are the ones that tried to rig the election they are the ones that did
[50:54.300 --> 51:03.420]  rig the primary and it's i mean it's a joke i mean this is insane president trump goes from
[51:03.420 --> 51:09.660]  city to city and gets tens of thousands of people to come out to hear him speak that is the president
[51:09.660 --> 51:18.220]  of the united states there is no one else there is no russians organizing tens of thousands of
[51:18.220 --> 51:24.700]  people to see donald trump that's donald fricking trump that's the us of a and you think you can
[51:24.700 --> 51:31.180]  distract us with some russian collusion bullcrap you're gonna tell us that the second american
[51:31.180 --> 51:40.620]  revolution is some russian front bogus bull this is america standing up to you and i don't care
[51:40.620 --> 51:44.700]  it was russia that hacked them it was set the rich that hacked them if it was goose fur that
[51:44.700 --> 51:49.740]  hacked them if it was someone sitting in their couch 300 pound hacker i don't care who it was
[51:49.740 --> 51:55.740]  we got them we caught all of you we caught peter stroke we caught rod rozenstein we caught the
[51:55.740 --> 52:05.660]  democrats we're not going to be distracted by your stupid fricking indictments what's let's
[52:06.380 --> 52:14.540]  let's review some of these headlines here this is nbc i don't know the date this is older news
[52:14.540 --> 52:21.260]  though russians penetrated us voter systems top u.s official says another one
[52:21.260 --> 52:30.220]  indiana joins idaho claiming dhs tried to hack their election systems another one again these
[52:30.220 --> 52:33.980]  are all old stories homeland security tried to attempt hack of george's election database
[52:35.660 --> 52:45.260]  so you had a series of those but then you had dhs come out and say no we have no intelligence
[52:45.260 --> 52:53.820]  that anybody hacked these systems or compromised the state's voting systems and now they're tiptoeing
[52:53.820 --> 52:58.860]  around that narrative as far as i can see they're not committing to it but they want you to think
[52:58.860 --> 53:07.500]  that's what happened show me the red wave put the red wave full screen give me the red wave full
[53:07.500 --> 53:15.340]  screen give it give me full screen no no i want just the red wave this is what you get
[53:16.300 --> 53:25.580]  ladies and gentlemen this is the future of america we are standing up together the democrat party is
[53:25.580 --> 53:35.660]  dead the left has gone totally insane the red wave is coming and so on the eve of trump meeting
[53:35.660 --> 53:40.780]  with putin they come out with this fake indictment over these russians with this fake narrative on
[53:40.780 --> 53:50.540]  the eve of the united states of america coming back breaking the shackles they tell you it's all
[53:50.540 --> 53:58.780]  russian collusion story nothing to see here guess what we're not buying it and on the eve of the
[53:58.780 --> 54:07.340]  midterm elections what do they do they make sure that they have their people own all of the proprietary
[54:07.340 --> 54:13.660]  software that gets installed on the electronic voting machines so that they can they can rig
[54:13.660 --> 54:22.300]  the final outcome but watch what happens next when they go totally insane and claim the russians
[54:22.300 --> 54:27.420]  are hacking the electronic voting machines and then we have to go back to paper ballots they
[54:27.420 --> 54:34.460]  don't want that if you had a paper ballot election donald trump would win 80 million to i don't know
[54:34.460 --> 54:43.180]  20 million wouldn't even be close and they know it and they've cornered themselves all right
[54:44.300 --> 54:49.180]  let's go back to rod rosensee here to conclude this segment the goblin creature
[54:50.300 --> 54:55.580]  forcing fake news upon us today comment on the evidence the evidence that reflects is reflected
[54:55.580 --> 55:03.020]  in our indictments and in our charges represents a determination by prosecutors and agents without
[55:03.020 --> 55:08.460]  regard to politics that we believe the evidence is going to be like obama of the charges harry
[55:09.100 --> 55:14.780]  yes deputy attorney general i know you've talked about the fact that in your view the evidence
[55:14.780 --> 55:21.100]  doesn't show any votes were changed as a result of this hacking but you did say that a company
[55:21.100 --> 55:26.300]  used as a pass through coordinated with these defendants to enhance the timing of the release
[55:26.300 --> 55:30.620]  and the impact on the election can you talk a little bit about what the evidence you have
[55:30.620 --> 55:34.940]  shows in that respect what i've talked about today is what is alleged in the indictment
[55:36.140 --> 55:41.420]  alleged we know according to the allegations in the indictment the goal of the allegations
[55:41.420 --> 55:47.020]  in fact in the election what impact they may have had or what their motivation you have nothing
[55:47.020 --> 55:51.340]  of what's required to you have nothing a little twist as a matter of speculation that's not our
[55:51.340 --> 55:56.940]  responsibility what i said is there's no allegation in the indictment about it and that's not we're
[55:56.940 --> 56:01.820]  shaking these losers off our backs in terms of the state election information set up about 500,000
[56:01.820 --> 56:06.220]  voters information was collected is there any evidence that what what the russians did with
[56:06.220 --> 56:10.700]  that information and is there any evidence of other states being successfully penetrated by the
[56:10.700 --> 56:15.260]  russians i think that it's important for you to understand what i've told you are the allegations
[56:15.260 --> 56:21.820]  that are included in the indictment the fbi and other intelligence community agencies now if there
[56:21.820 --> 56:28.540]  was a real journalist in this media scrum right here they'd say um uh um nitwit rozenstein do you
[56:28.540 --> 56:36.300]  plan on launching any investigations upon the damning exposure that was in the actual documents
[56:36.300 --> 56:40.460]  that was released the rigging of the primaries uh the rigging of the presidential debates do you
[56:40.460 --> 56:45.100]  plan on doing any investigations into what was exposed from those documents or are you just
[56:45.100 --> 56:50.380]  going to let hillary slide again share any relevant intelligence with all of our partners it would take
[56:50.380 --> 56:55.020]  a longer time to talk about this but there is a concerted and organized effort by the federal
[56:55.020 --> 57:00.380]  government to make sure that we do deter and prevent any sort of cyber attacks on our elections
[57:00.380 --> 57:05.100]  and that we let's go to paper ballots to prevent against yeah kind of intrusions let's go to paper
[57:05.100 --> 57:09.500]  ballots see but this is what they're going to do thank you we're going to break now you can take
[57:09.500 --> 57:14.940]  them out this is what they're going to do then now they're going to try to say that dhs has to run
[57:14.940 --> 57:20.140]  all elections the states and local governments don't get to even monitor them at all they're
[57:20.140 --> 57:23.420]  going to give it all over the federal government that's what he just said this is how they're
[57:23.420 --> 57:30.220]  going to rig the next election you're going to get beat man you you you keep fighting you keep
[57:30.220 --> 57:35.900]  digging yourself a hole deeper and deeper don't you you just can't give up you just can't let go
[57:35.900 --> 57:40.300]  you just had to drown this country didn't you you just had to choke us to death didn't you
[57:40.300 --> 57:44.700]  and now that we're breathing and swinging back you still think you have us in your clutches

[01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:13.420]  you know this is actually interesting rod rozenstein and robert muhler claim
[01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:18.220]  well actually they're alleging they don't even claim to know this for sure there's they're they're
[01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:25.180]  they're alleging that the russians hacked the d triple c and the dnc but this is confusing to me
[01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:33.180]  because the d triple c and the dnc refused to turn their servers over so how does rod rozenstein
[01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:37.580]  and robert muhler know that when they didn't cooperate with the investigation and refuse
[01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:44.380]  to turn their servers over boy that is an amazing assumption to make wonder how they reached that
[01:00:44.380 --> 01:00:49.580]  conclusion of course they didn't conclude that they're just alleging that like paul maniforte
[01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:53.820]  being in jail for alleged attempting i don't care what you put behind that you can't lock
[01:00:53.820 --> 01:01:02.380]  someone up for alleged attempting this is america so i'm now joined by larry claimant the founder
[01:01:02.380 --> 01:01:08.140]  of judicial watch and freedom watch where you can see his work at freedom watch usa dot org
[01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:13.740]  short segment here larry will be with us for two more segments on the other side but i mean larry
[01:01:13.740 --> 01:01:20.940]  this is pretty incredible stuff considering everything we've seen from the fake russian
[01:01:20.940 --> 01:01:26.300]  collusion probe for them to now reach this point right before trump meets with putin
[01:01:26.940 --> 01:01:31.500]  what does it tell you does it tell you how desperate they are or do you really believe
[01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:37.020]  that the russians are responsible for all this hacking oh and you raised an excellent point yeah
[01:01:37.020 --> 01:01:41.980]  how do they know this if they don't have access to the dnc servers and of course they don't have
[01:01:41.980 --> 01:01:48.060]  access the fbi and and muller because what's on those dnc servers will be extremely incriminating
[01:01:48.060 --> 01:01:52.780]  for the democratic national committee hillary clinton and others but yeah this is political
[01:01:52.780 --> 01:01:57.980]  hackery this is exactly what we've seen with robert muller it's more than a witch hunt they're
[01:01:57.980 --> 01:02:03.340]  trying to impede they're trying to destroy this summit with the vladmer putin which is coming
[01:02:03.340 --> 01:02:08.220]  up in just a day or so and it's quite obvious why this was done now and the fact that you have
[01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:14.460]  this very corrupt deputy attorney general rozenstein announcing this on behalf of muller and
[01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:19.820]  behalf of the justice department with inner attorney general of sessions who raises head in
[01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:25.420]  the sand because he too is under investigation by muller for alleged russian collusion it tells you
[01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:30.460]  that our justice department has become a political entity it's not a department of justice anymore
[01:02:30.460 --> 01:02:36.700]  it's an department of injustice yeah and what does it tell you that rod rozenstein is out here
[01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:43.020]  making the statement and and sessions is nowhere to be found i mean it's almost like they're they're
[01:02:43.020 --> 01:02:49.500]  pushing rozenstein on us just to rub it in our face absolutely well you know he's on a jihad
[01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:54.220]  rozenstein literally because he's been stung by certain people in capitol hill that asked him
[01:02:54.220 --> 01:02:57.900]  tough questions of course nothing happens on capitol hill but he doesn't like the questions
[01:02:57.900 --> 01:03:03.100]  anyway and he doesn't like the president criticizing him directly and indirectly
[01:03:03.100 --> 01:03:07.820]  and he's probably on orders from sessions who you know the president would like to see gone
[01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:13.340]  to do a number on trump at this point it's warfare between the president and the justice
[01:03:13.340 --> 01:03:18.460]  department it's warfare between the american people and the justice department and oh and i'm a
[01:03:18.460 --> 01:03:23.660]  alumnus of the justice department i'm absolutely disgusted at this whole thing and that's why we're
[01:03:23.660 --> 01:03:29.180]  actually going to be doing our own grand juries for the american people in dalas and other places
[01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:33.660]  because we need to take justice into our own hands we don't have a justice system anymore
[01:03:33.660 --> 01:03:39.340]  we'll do it peacefully and legally but we have the right to in panel to indict to try to convict
[01:03:39.340 --> 01:03:45.500]  sentence and even do citizens arrest peacefully and legally the clinton's comie moeller intelligence
[01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:51.660]  agency chief senator obama and obama himself are our prime target so this is a justice department
[01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:56.620]  which is spinning wildly out of control which does not represent the interests of either
[01:03:56.620 --> 01:04:02.220]  president trump or the american people and rod rozenstein is the poster boy of the corruption
[01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:08.700]  over there i want to talk more about that on the other side because i mean that's just an incredible
[01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:13.500]  move that that you're making over there at freedomwatchusa.org and i'd like to talk about that but
[01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:20.940]  you know isn't it funny larry when you founded judicial watch what was it just over 20 years ago
[01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:25.660]  part of the original investigations were into hillary clinton and illegally having classified
[01:04:25.660 --> 01:04:29.340]  documents isn't it funny that still to this day you're investigating the same damn thing
[01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:36.380]  absolutely and we're not just investigating we're bringing cases i mean i have a lawsuit going up
[01:04:36.380 --> 01:04:42.140]  to the supreme court for hillary's wrongful death actions which killed two of our client's sons ty
[01:04:42.140 --> 01:04:47.580]  woodson shawn smith at ben gazi because her server was hacked and the terrorists found the
[01:04:47.580 --> 01:04:52.620]  coordinates of ambassador chris stevens and killed everybody so we bring hard hitting cases i'm tired
[01:04:52.620 --> 01:04:56.540]  oh and this is why and the people are tired of tired with you and we'll be right back with more
[01:04:58.060 --> 01:05:04.460]  i want to plow into all of this that i'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging
[01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:11.900]  listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books or videos
[01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:19.260]  or other material from infostore.com you are funding the revolution i mean i cannot say it
[01:05:19.260 --> 01:05:24.460]  any clear and so it is essential that you purchase the products at infowarstore.com i don't want to
[01:05:24.460 --> 01:05:28.780]  thank everybody that has but we've got the best fluoride free toothpaste with colloidal silver
[01:05:28.780 --> 01:05:33.980]  and with high quality atomic iodine in it you cannot beat that for children and adults we've
[01:05:33.980 --> 01:05:39.260]  got the best mouthwash designed by dr jones that's my dad the colloidal silver and iodine as well
[01:05:39.260 --> 01:05:44.940]  infowarslife.com or triple a two five three three one three nine and your purchase of the products
[01:05:44.940 --> 01:05:49.260]  stands with us stands with america stands with trump stands against the globalists
[01:05:49.260 --> 01:05:53.500]  and their satanic pedophile armies and that's who they are and they know we know who they are
[01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:55.500]  and they're coming back against us so we need your support
[01:06:02.380 --> 01:06:10.460]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[01:06:10.460 --> 01:06:18.540]  and now your host owin treuer larry claimant has been doing great work founded judicial watch
[01:06:18.540 --> 01:06:26.620]  and is now running freedom watch usa.org larry i was unaware of this campaign that you talked about
[01:06:26.620 --> 01:06:29.900]  in the last segment i'm not sure how much you've talked about this but i'd really like to hear
[01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:35.820]  more about this what is it exactly that you are planning on doing with freedom watch usa.org to
[01:06:35.820 --> 01:06:42.300]  bring justice to high treasonous criminals like clinton and obama that we don't get from the justice
[01:06:42.300 --> 01:06:50.060]  department thank you all for raising that i'm tired of watching tv not info wars because you
[01:06:50.060 --> 01:06:54.940]  guys tell it like it is and that's why i love being on here but offering this false hope that
[01:06:54.940 --> 01:06:59.660]  something's going to happen we just saw the hearings on capitol hill yesterday yes it exposed who
[01:06:59.660 --> 01:07:04.140]  peter struck is but congress isn't going to do anything our justice department is just doing
[01:07:04.140 --> 01:07:10.220]  stuff which is negative which actually harms the president in the country and of course other
[01:07:10.220 --> 01:07:15.420]  branches of government have been in or two so we need to take matters into our own hands and justice
[01:07:15.420 --> 01:07:20.940]  antenin scalia in nineteen ninety two in a case style the united states versus williams
[01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:25.820]  said that the grand jury doesn't belong to the three branches of government it belongs to the
[01:07:25.820 --> 01:07:32.060]  american people now up to july first of eighteen seventy we didn't even have a justice department
[01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:37.100]  so the american people needed to meet out justice and we have the right to do that under our
[01:07:37.100 --> 01:07:43.020]  constitution so what i'm proposing to do in dallas philadelphia and other cities around the country
[01:07:43.020 --> 01:07:49.340]  is to impanel grand juries from neutral voter rolls to put forward evidence we've got enough evidence
[01:07:49.340 --> 01:07:54.540]  we don't need any more information here to indict the clinton's to indict muller to indict comie to
[01:07:54.540 --> 01:07:59.740]  invite john brennan former head of the cia james clapper former head of the director of national
[01:07:59.740 --> 01:08:06.780]  intelligence and obama himself we've got enough and then we will try these individuals in front of
[01:08:06.780 --> 01:08:12.620]  either a retired judge or someone who's neutral we will obtain convictions i'm convinced the evidence
[01:08:12.620 --> 01:08:19.260]  is overwhelming we will then sentence these individuals and will seek to arrest them peacefully
[01:08:19.260 --> 01:08:25.420]  and legally what else what other choice do we have our country does not have a justice system
[01:08:25.420 --> 01:08:30.300]  we have an attorney general and a deputy attorney general who are absent on the job and are actually
[01:08:30.300 --> 01:08:35.420]  working against the american people and trying to destroy the president himself the president
[01:08:35.420 --> 01:08:40.780]  who i think is doing a fantastic job and this of course get back to what rozenberg rozenberg
[01:08:40.780 --> 01:08:47.900]  that's a freudian slip rozenstein did just today is that he's trying to derail the putin
[01:08:47.900 --> 01:08:52.220]  trump summit he's trying to embarrass the president he's trying to humiliate the president
[01:08:52.220 --> 01:08:56.700]  so as muller they're working together these people need to be removed now i also have on
[01:08:56.700 --> 01:09:02.060]  on our website at freedomwatchusa.org a petition we have 25 000 plus names right now
[01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:07.420]  to have me name special counsel so in addition to the citizen's grand juries if i was special
[01:09:07.420 --> 01:09:13.180]  counsel the second one all these people i would have the powers of the justice department without
[01:09:13.180 --> 01:09:17.260]  actually having to take orders from them and i would indict them convict them and have them
[01:09:17.260 --> 01:09:22.700]  tried and sentenced as well so there aren't many people in this country in fact i don't know of
[01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:27.580]  anyone if i can maybe toot my own horn a little bit here who will stick their neck out to this
[01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:33.100]  degree you know alex will you will others will do it in the media side i have to do it in the
[01:09:33.100 --> 01:09:38.460]  justice system and not even my former group does that they get documents but it's not run by a
[01:09:38.460 --> 01:09:44.220]  lawyer i'm a lawyer of 40 years experience as a trial lawyer as a prosecutor i'll get the job done
[01:09:44.220 --> 01:09:50.940]  i'll bring about justice well and imagine i mean you look at the total rogue state of the
[01:09:50.940 --> 01:09:59.580]  muller probe right now imagine if if if larry clayman had a staff and the same rogue investigatory
[01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:04.780]  tactics of muller to investigate muller to or investigate Pelosi in waters i mean it'd be
[01:10:04.780 --> 01:10:10.300]  game over for these people and everybody knows that's the case of course that's the case you know
[01:10:10.300 --> 01:10:15.900]  and so but but what can people do to help you spearhead this movement and to help help move it
[01:10:15.900 --> 01:10:22.540]  forward well we need the resources we're small right now we're the mouse that roared we're powerful
[01:10:22.540 --> 01:10:27.660]  but we need to get bigger these citizens grand jury's are going to be expensive and a lot of
[01:10:27.660 --> 01:10:32.780]  logistics a lot of individuals involved so go to our website at freedomwatchusa.org
[01:10:33.420 --> 01:10:37.020]  don't just sign the petition to have me name special counsel we need a hundred thousand
[01:10:37.020 --> 01:10:42.380]  signatures to get the president's attention he's so preoccupied right now with serious crises
[01:10:42.940 --> 01:10:48.780]  but also donate to our cause join our freedom watches justice league i just started this
[01:10:49.820 --> 01:10:54.300]  because this movie for instance which i saw a couple times on the plane going back to
[01:10:54.300 --> 01:10:59.180]  washington in the last few weeks really tells you that the american people can do it we are the
[01:10:59.180 --> 01:11:03.580]  superheroes we don't have to depend on government no that's right you know that's right the superheroes
[01:11:03.580 --> 01:11:08.140]  of justice league didn't look to the justice department to do it they did it for themselves
[01:11:08.140 --> 01:11:14.300]  so it's a good analogy so go to freedomwatchusa.org donate to our cause it's tax deductible
[01:11:14.300 --> 01:11:19.500]  sign the petitions get our newsletters become part of our citizens army our justice league
[01:11:20.060 --> 01:11:25.580]  and look you know i'm this is hitting me more than ever right now larry and i know that you've
[01:11:25.580 --> 01:11:29.100]  been there obviously i mean you've been working to just watch freedom watch and out you're not
[01:11:29.100 --> 01:11:36.860]  organizing this i mean it's time to get active it's time to get engaged we as americans have a duty
[01:11:36.860 --> 01:11:42.140]  to protect this republic it is under threat it is under siege right now our government's totally
[01:11:42.140 --> 01:11:48.380]  corrupt it's been corrupt it's way too big we've got these huge global institutions like nato
[01:11:48.380 --> 01:11:52.700]  that do nothing for us it's time to shut it all down people need to get engaged and active they
[01:11:52.700 --> 01:11:57.900]  need to understand i'm not calling for a bunch of uh minion protests in the street we're not calling
[01:11:57.900 --> 01:12:02.060]  for a bunch of craziness we're not calling for violence we're saying it's time for us to organize
[01:12:02.060 --> 01:12:07.820]  it's time for everyone that listens to this show to go to freedomwatchusa.org sign the petition
[01:12:07.820 --> 01:12:13.740]  tell your friends and family get engaged get active it's now or never folks we have the president in
[01:12:13.740 --> 01:12:19.580]  the white house if we have his back he has every mandate to do whatever is possible to save this
[01:12:19.580 --> 01:12:25.660]  republic you're right if he goes down we're gonna have a president a hundred times worse than obama
[01:12:25.660 --> 01:12:31.580]  or clinton the next president we can't let that happen now he is our hope in terms of the government
[01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:38.700]  but the american people remain their own hope as the justice league is their hope and if you're tired
[01:12:38.700 --> 01:12:45.740]  of watching cable news not info wars but cable news and seeing this false hope being served up every
[01:12:45.740 --> 01:12:50.540]  night you know i watch fox news too but it gives you the impression something's happening nothing's
[01:12:50.540 --> 01:12:55.820]  happening we know nothing's happened we've been out there fighting the clinton's for 25 years
[01:12:56.380 --> 01:13:02.220]  since i started judicial watching now i run freedom watch i have a finding that bill clinton
[01:13:02.220 --> 01:13:06.940]  committed a crime when he released the hot privacy act protected files of a woman he harassed in the
[01:13:06.940 --> 01:13:13.100]  oval office kathleen willie but now's the time that we have to do it for ourselves and our founding
[01:13:13.100 --> 01:13:18.860]  fathers they risk their lives they pledge their fortunes and sacred honor to form a new nation
[01:13:18.860 --> 01:13:24.300]  we can at least do citizens grand juries we have the legal right to do it justice galia said we have
[01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:29.340]  the right to do it and we can even enforce it and and we're gonna have to do citizens arrest i always
[01:13:29.340 --> 01:13:38.220]  say please we have the role well and even president trump said we're gonna give the government back
[01:13:38.220 --> 01:13:42.540]  to the people you know what guys let's let's let's let larry get reconnected here and let's just

[01:18:59.660 --> 01:19:05.500]  may sound more dramatic than it really is the real drama can be found here in leilani estates
[01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:10.620]  but a lot of us on the big island rely on rain water and we need to be concerned about ash and
[01:19:10.620 --> 01:19:17.260]  acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the ph of
[01:19:17.260 --> 01:19:23.340]  the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series of tests for heavy metals
[01:19:23.340 --> 01:19:29.260]  alkalinity and ph what we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and
[01:19:29.260 --> 01:19:35.660]  acidity in the rain water next we tested the water from our alexa pure gravity filter and not
[01:19:35.660 --> 01:19:41.500]  only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure but the ph was also restored to optimal
[01:19:41.500 --> 01:19:48.220]  levels as it turns out the filter on the alexa pure raises the ph of the water so what we've
[01:19:48.220 --> 01:19:54.700]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rain water supply but more importantly
[01:19:54.700 --> 01:20:10.620]  a good water filtration system will purify it you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:34.460]  well larry claimant has dragon energy and he is spearheading a movement to unite the citizens
[01:20:34.460 --> 01:20:43.580]  of america against individuals who have committed crimes of high treason against this country yes
[01:20:43.580 --> 01:20:51.740]  you know who we're talking about and as far as i can tell i don't see anyone else pushing this
[01:20:51.740 --> 01:20:57.660]  and for an organization of this like larry claimant is doing with freedom watch usa.org larry
[01:20:57.660 --> 01:21:02.140]  is still with me for another segment larry you mentioned you are planning to have grand jury
[01:21:02.140 --> 01:21:08.460]  events in dallas and philadelphia do you have a date set for those yet yes it's going to be in
[01:21:08.460 --> 01:21:14.060]  and about as lawyers say the 25th of september we need time to ramp up we need to get names
[01:21:14.060 --> 01:21:18.860]  off of voter rolls you know go to our website sign up we can use some volunteers here too
[01:21:18.860 --> 01:21:23.980]  and we need to be able to put this in place but we're going to do it in a very very professional
[01:21:24.540 --> 01:21:29.420]  ethical and legal way so it sticks and it's going to be powerful when we do it and we're
[01:21:29.420 --> 01:21:33.660]  going to set an example and when we get those sentences we're going to show up in front of
[01:21:33.660 --> 01:21:38.700]  the houses of these people hillary clinton and calorama washington turn yourself in hillary
[01:21:38.700 --> 01:21:43.420]  because we have a right to arrest you and put you where you belong and we're going to ask for a
[01:21:43.420 --> 01:21:49.740]  judge to enforce these sentences the result of our indictments and convictions with the citizens
[01:21:49.740 --> 01:21:56.060]  grand juries so even if we don't have a judge do it we can do it on our own peacefully and legally
[01:21:56.060 --> 01:22:03.180]  so yes in and around the september 25th keep posted on our website at freedomwatchusa.org
[01:22:03.180 --> 01:22:08.620]  sign up donate support our cause this is really our only last hope and oh and you know we all watch
[01:22:08.620 --> 01:22:14.700]  a fox news and we watch other networks and we see this false hope every night that something's
[01:22:14.700 --> 01:22:18.860]  going to happen and i've been listening lately and i hear people saying wasn't it great that we got
[01:22:18.860 --> 01:22:24.460]  more information out no it's not that great we have enough information to indict and convict
[01:22:24.460 --> 01:22:29.420]  these criminals like hillary clinton and bill clinton right now we don't need any more information
[01:22:29.420 --> 01:22:34.540]  what we need is action you know and this is something that's actually kind of been weighing
[01:22:34.540 --> 01:22:42.220]  on my mind lately given just how absurd the news cycle has gotten how insane the left has gotten
[01:22:42.220 --> 01:22:51.340]  where you know for me i'm sitting here reflecting upon what i do saying is it the best investment
[01:22:51.340 --> 01:22:57.260]  of my time on the air to report all the fake news to cover all the stuff we know that you're
[01:22:57.260 --> 01:23:01.740]  talking about it's like we already know this it's like sometimes i feel like i'm beating my head
[01:23:01.740 --> 01:23:06.700]  against a wall and i think the solution is what you're doing and i want to do more of this here
[01:23:06.700 --> 01:23:13.420]  at info wars where i mean yes we we need to cover the fake news to sort it all out because there's
[01:23:13.420 --> 01:23:17.260]  people out there that genuinely don't understand all of it they're new to this and they want the
[01:23:17.260 --> 01:23:23.580]  truth they want the answers but at a different level we have to organize we we have to now get
[01:23:23.580 --> 01:23:28.540]  active we have to do things like start an independent grand jury of citizens like larry
[01:23:28.540 --> 01:23:34.780]  claiming is doing we have to plan stunts like they do where they go out and and do a woman's
[01:23:34.780 --> 01:23:39.180]  march you know as if trump is the first guy to ever say anything about you know a woman's
[01:23:39.180 --> 01:23:43.260]  private parts in the history of mankind give me a break bill clinton was grabbing him his entire
[01:23:43.260 --> 01:23:50.300]  life so that that to me is the next angle of info wars and i think that you're spearheading one
[01:23:50.300 --> 01:23:55.980]  movement so let me know about when you're doing this in dallas because larry i want to be there
[01:23:55.980 --> 01:24:00.140]  and i want to be covering it for info wars so just once again tell the audience where they
[01:24:00.140 --> 01:24:05.420]  can go to get information and help out your cause to start an independent grand jury of citizens
[01:24:05.420 --> 01:24:10.220]  to bring our own charges and a citizen's arrest against high treason and crime against this country
[01:24:10.220 --> 01:24:14.700]  well thank you on for offering to do that i'd like to have what we're doing in real time on info wars
[01:24:15.340 --> 01:24:20.140]  and uh you can be part of it and and everybody needs to be part of it but yes they can go to
[01:24:20.140 --> 01:24:30.140]  freedom watch usa dot org freedom watch usa dot org that's org and sign up because we are deadly
[01:24:30.140 --> 01:24:34.940]  serious about this we are going to bring these citizens grand juries we are going to be the
[01:24:34.940 --> 01:24:39.980]  people's justice department we already are but we're putting it into effect now and i have 40
[01:24:39.980 --> 01:24:45.420]  years of experience that i'm going to draw on to get the job done to turn this country back
[01:24:45.420 --> 01:24:51.020]  to the vision of our founding fathers and to bring about a equal system of justice where the elites
[01:24:51.020 --> 01:24:56.940]  where the arrogant fat cat elites in washington dc of both political parties walk off scott free
[01:24:59.740 --> 01:25:03.900]  is there anything else you have up your sleeve right now or is this pretty much your focus
[01:25:03.900 --> 01:25:08.540]  at freedom watch usa is this pretty much where you're you're investing all of your time and energy now
[01:25:09.820 --> 01:25:12.620]  most of it but i do have other things up my sleeve for instance
[01:25:12.620 --> 01:25:18.540]  uh on september 4th a judge in washington dc has ordered one of the few honest judges
[01:25:18.540 --> 01:25:23.740]  is that was appointed by bill clinton a guy named emet sullivan that moeller's going to have to
[01:25:23.740 --> 01:25:29.740]  release all of his documentation his emails of communications with the media and i'm convinced
[01:25:29.740 --> 01:25:34.780]  that's going to show criminal grand jury leaks we're going to use that to have him indicted
[01:25:34.780 --> 01:25:39.580]  with the citizens grand juries and we're also hopeful that once that comes out president trump
[01:25:39.580 --> 01:25:44.540]  uh will summon up uh the strength because he's been getting bad advice from his lawyers to
[01:25:44.540 --> 01:25:49.740]  finally fire moeller and to fire rozenstein and to fire sessions and clean house at the justice
[01:25:49.740 --> 01:25:54.940]  department so yeah we have a lot of things and of course we have our case going to the supreme court
[01:25:54.940 --> 01:26:00.460]  to hold hillary clinton accountable for the wrongful death of our gold star family's sons
[01:26:00.460 --> 01:26:06.620]  thai woods and sean smith at then gazi because it was her use of a private email server which was
[01:26:06.620 --> 01:26:11.500]  hacked probably by the terrorists which gave rise to the coordinates of the ambassador which then
[01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:16.060]  allowed the terrorists to kill our client's sons she has blood on her hands so we're proceeding
[01:26:16.060 --> 01:26:22.380]  with that too and and many other things you can see it at freedomwatchusa.org that we are constantly
[01:26:22.380 --> 01:26:28.220]  bringing hard-hitting cases we're coming up with innovative but legal ideas like citizens grand
[01:26:28.220 --> 01:26:33.420]  juries we just don't get documents the freedom of information act we actually take action we are your
[01:26:33.420 --> 01:26:41.580]  justice department the real one and you know i sit here and i think about what you're saying and
[01:26:41.580 --> 01:26:45.900]  i it's just like it's unbelievable that they're they're thinking about running hillary again
[01:26:46.540 --> 01:26:51.820]  i mean this woman is halfway to hell she's been she's been caught red-handed breaking law after
[01:26:51.820 --> 01:26:56.860]  law after law having a wide open illegal private server with classified information anybody can
[01:26:56.860 --> 01:27:03.580]  come in get information get this information kill us soldiers and then she gets away with i mean i
[01:27:04.620 --> 01:27:10.460]  honestly i just can't believe that we've reached this point now final comments from larry climbing
[01:27:10.460 --> 01:27:16.780]  here before we let you go what do you think comes next as far as what trump does with this
[01:27:16.780 --> 01:27:20.860]  Mueller investigation obviously you've called for him being fired but they're doubling down
[01:27:20.860 --> 01:27:24.300]  they just did the press conference with rosenstein today they're indicting more russians they're
[01:27:24.300 --> 01:27:27.500]  claiming they're hacking and everything so they're doubling tripling quadrupling down
[01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:33.260]  do you see that trend continuing and what does trump do to stop it i see it continuing and that's
[01:27:33.260 --> 01:27:39.100]  why i want to bring about the indictment of robert moeller i want him convicted i want him put away
[01:27:39.740 --> 01:27:46.220]  because he's on a jihad right now literally no no less than a legal terrorist and the fact
[01:27:46.220 --> 01:27:51.580]  that there was an indictment today of these russians was to try to destroy and to embarrass
[01:27:51.580 --> 01:27:57.500]  and to humiliate him in his summit with ladmir putin these people are evil to the core they're
[01:27:57.500 --> 01:28:03.660]  literally disciples of the devil if i might say analogously and they need to be taken out legally
[01:28:03.660 --> 01:28:08.060]  and the president you know is not getting good advice from his own in-house lawyers because
[01:28:08.060 --> 01:28:12.860]  he's just getting dragged along gets worse and worse and worse and now the american people
[01:28:12.860 --> 01:28:18.940]  are going to have to rise up in his defense and in defense of their own interests i think that you
[01:28:18.940 --> 01:28:26.220]  have coined a new phrase here i think robert moeller is a legal terrorist he is a legal terrorist
[01:28:26.220 --> 01:28:31.660]  and this russia investigation that we know is fake they claim that they had this information
[01:28:31.660 --> 01:28:35.980]  but the dnc the d triple c haven't even turned over the server so how do you have it larry
[01:28:35.980 --> 01:28:40.140]  claiming thank you so much you're doing great work freedom watch usa dot org folks go to that
[01:28:40.140 --> 01:28:45.980]  website support larry claiming we we have to do this if we're not going to take action
[01:28:45.980 --> 01:28:52.940]  for justice and for the republic then who will i guess russia apparently will will america let's

[01:33:39.660 --> 01:33:46.140]  because they know the american people are awakened to all the crimes and lies that they have been
[01:33:46.140 --> 01:33:58.460]  committing to for decades wow you know to think about rod rosenstein saying today
[01:34:00.300 --> 01:34:05.340]  in this indictments in the indictments of the 12 russians that they know that it was the russians
[01:34:05.340 --> 01:34:11.900]  that hacked the dnc and d triple c servers miraculously considering that the d triple c
[01:34:11.900 --> 01:34:19.580]  and the dnc refused to turn those servers over and i still say if it was the russians that released
[01:34:19.580 --> 01:34:24.700]  all of this data and all these documents on all the corruption going on in the democrat party
[01:34:24.700 --> 01:34:29.740]  which then resulted in hillary losing because she was so corrupt and the democrats were so corrupt
[01:34:30.540 --> 01:34:39.100]  is that not a good thing i don't know but in london we know this they hate donald trump
[01:34:39.100 --> 01:34:45.100]  they really don't know why but they know they hate them and they're marching and they've got
[01:34:45.100 --> 01:34:53.660]  their trump balloon and so paul joseph watching joins me now well paul are you having fun it seems
[01:34:53.660 --> 01:35:00.060]  like you're having some fun with these protesters out there well it's always fun to highlight their
[01:35:00.060 --> 01:35:05.020]  idiocy owin because they don't know what they're talking about we have this trump bloom a big event
[01:35:05.020 --> 01:35:11.420]  one week or more probably 10 days of sustained hardcore intense media coverage mainstream media
[01:35:11.420 --> 01:35:16.140]  coverage this was going to be the big event this was going to be the big rallying call
[01:35:16.140 --> 01:35:20.620]  and this is not to say that they haven't got decent numbers in terms of protesters later on today
[01:35:20.620 --> 01:35:26.060]  but this balloon event this was the big deal this was the the entire media play for the whole week
[01:35:26.620 --> 01:35:31.420]  the massive the huge the gigantic trump balloon and they see on screen right there in the middle
[01:35:31.420 --> 01:35:37.740]  of central london in the main square parliament square they got about what four five hundred
[01:35:37.740 --> 01:35:45.420]  people max after one week of sustained mainstream media coverage this was a global story and you
[01:35:45.420 --> 01:35:50.780]  have to consider the fact owin that tourists are milling around the area constantly so i'd say at
[01:35:50.780 --> 01:35:55.340]  least a quarter of the bodies you see in that photograph are going to be tourists anyway at
[01:35:55.340 --> 01:36:01.260]  least around the edges so it was a pathetic failure of course at the start of this some people reacted
[01:36:01.260 --> 01:36:05.580]  in the wrong way some people on the right trump supporters were saying you know oh this is so
[01:36:05.580 --> 01:36:09.260]  offensive they shouldn't be allowed to do that now that's not how you react that is getting
[01:36:09.260 --> 01:36:15.020]  triggered the proper way to react is to laugh because this was completely pathetic it was
[01:36:15.020 --> 01:36:20.540]  billed as a large protest as you see there bbc large-scale protests it was billed as a giant
[01:36:20.540 --> 01:36:26.700]  huge balloon that would fly over parliament in fact if you go on my twitter account right now
[01:36:26.700 --> 01:36:32.220]  there's a there's a meme that i posted what i expected and what i got and the way they promoted
[01:36:32.220 --> 01:36:36.060]  it was that this would be flying over the houses of parliament it would be flying over london
[01:36:36.060 --> 01:36:42.460]  they got it about 40 feet in the air you couldn't even see it over the nearest adjacent building so
[01:36:42.460 --> 01:36:46.940]  nobody could see it unless they were in that sparse group of people within the square and it
[01:36:46.940 --> 01:36:52.460]  was it was tiny it was too small to be seen it was up there in the air for less than two hours
[01:36:52.460 --> 01:36:56.780]  then it came down people were asking me oh how do i find the trump balloon i want to go and see the
[01:36:56.780 --> 01:37:01.180]  trump balloon it already come down by the time people were asking or by the time anyone cared
[01:37:01.180 --> 01:37:06.620]  about it so the proper reaction was to laugh at it because you knew it was going to be a pathetic
[01:37:06.620 --> 01:37:11.100]  failure and that's exactly what turned out to happen yeah i remember when they first released
[01:37:11.100 --> 01:37:16.380]  this story a week or so ago they were they were dubbing it a blimp they were saying they have
[01:37:16.380 --> 01:37:23.340]  they have confirmed the trump baby blimp uh blimps are actually big what you have there is a party
[01:37:23.340 --> 01:37:30.540]  balloon that was pathetic yeah it's not exactly good year blimp size is it um but the the thing to
[01:37:30.540 --> 01:37:35.420]  think about as well with this is you know we had a fundraiser i at least helped with it and they've
[01:37:35.420 --> 01:37:40.940]  got a big event coming up next month for a sedeek karn baby balloon and the thing is even though
[01:37:40.940 --> 01:37:47.980]  with intense 10 day media coverage for this trump blimp the giant blimp that wasn't they raised 30
[01:37:47.980 --> 01:37:53.260]  thousand pounds and by the way how on earth does this party balloon cost 30 000 pounds that's about
[01:37:53.260 --> 01:37:59.500]  40 000 dollars what on earth are they doing with that money by the way but we raised more money
[01:37:59.500 --> 01:38:06.380]  than they did in 30 days in three days it shows you how pathetic the mainstream media is now
[01:38:06.380 --> 01:38:12.700]  they can barely get 500 people to a protest it takes them a month to raise 30 000 pounds we did
[01:38:12.700 --> 01:38:17.420]  it in three days and there's going to be a big event next month with people victims of violent
[01:38:17.420 --> 01:38:23.020]  crime in london victims of the sedeek carnage getting up on stage giving speeches it's going to
[01:38:23.020 --> 01:38:29.260]  be a big big protest event bigger than this one i can promise you that and hopefully a bigger balloon
[01:38:29.260 --> 01:38:34.620]  but that's already completely funded in fact they're getting close to like 60 000 pounds at this
[01:38:34.620 --> 01:38:41.340]  point which is about 80 000 dollars in about the space of a week with no positive mainstream media
[01:38:41.340 --> 01:38:46.860]  coverage so again that just shows you how committed how loyal our audience and the true freedom the
[01:38:46.860 --> 01:38:52.860]  true free speech audiences we completely kicked their butt on fundraising with no media attention
[01:38:52.860 --> 01:38:57.900]  this was a complete failure and our event or at least the one that i'm supporting is going to be
[01:38:57.900 --> 01:39:05.500]  a giant success and you've got the tommy robinson march tomorrow as well that that i'm expecting to
[01:39:05.500 --> 01:39:12.060]  be massive but but i'm just curious so is the plan with the sedeek khan balloon is it to make it a
[01:39:12.060 --> 01:39:18.540]  baby is that the plan yeah they're gonna make it a baby in fact what was funny sedeek khan was asked
[01:39:18.540 --> 01:39:23.900]  himself by piers morgan a couple of days ago on television what if somebody made a giant pig balloon
[01:39:23.900 --> 01:39:29.180]  of you and made it look like half like sedeek khan half like a pig would that be allowed you know
[01:39:29.180 --> 01:39:34.780]  sounds pretty islamophobic to me would he allow that so the question remains they haven't got approval
[01:39:34.780 --> 01:39:38.620]  for it yet they're still waiting for all the funding to come in so yeah they're going to have
[01:39:38.620 --> 01:39:45.340]  this big protest event they're going to fly the sedeek khan baby balloon over the protest and it's
[01:39:45.340 --> 01:39:50.300]  going to be huge it's going to be way bigger than this one with with no media coverage in comparison
[01:39:50.300 --> 01:39:54.140]  by the way this is like oh and this is like you remember those hillary clinton rallies
[01:39:54.140 --> 01:39:59.820]  where cnn had the cameras really in tight on the crowd so it looked like it was it was well attended
[01:39:59.820 --> 01:40:06.380]  as soon as they drew back the arena was like three quarters empty that's the equivalent that
[01:40:06.380 --> 01:40:09.980]  we're seeing yeah they couldn't even get they couldn't even get a full audience with lebron
[01:40:09.980 --> 01:40:15.820]  james and jz nobody would even still show up to support hillary but hey you know what i gotta say
[01:40:15.820 --> 01:40:21.100]  hey i think that they should and maybe you can help maybe you can pull some strings on this i think
[01:40:21.100 --> 01:40:25.820]  they should change it they shouldn't go with the baby they should do sedeek khan and they should
[01:40:25.820 --> 01:40:30.380]  dress him up like a terrorist with a bunch of blood on his hands and like a knife and stuff
[01:40:30.380 --> 01:40:33.660]  that's what they should do that's a way more powerful message especially if you're going to
[01:40:33.660 --> 01:40:38.460]  have the victims of all the violent crime crime speaking yeah yeah you could do something where
[01:40:38.460 --> 01:40:43.420]  he's literally got blood on his hands because of the the soaring violent crime the acid attacks
[01:40:43.420 --> 01:40:47.980]  that have taken place under his watch so they haven't designed it yet as far as i know they only
[01:40:47.980 --> 01:40:53.580]  start the project like a week ago the money's still rolling in so the design for the balloon itself
[01:40:53.580 --> 01:40:57.820]  which is being called a balloon it's not being called a blimp but the design for it is still open
[01:40:57.820 --> 01:41:03.020]  so that's definitely would probably make more sense given the nature of the event yeah i think
[01:41:03.020 --> 01:41:08.220]  that that would be really powerful imagery too considering the messages that are going to be
[01:41:08.220 --> 01:41:14.700]  going on with it so but you've you've got the trump protests going on in london today and you've
[01:41:14.700 --> 01:41:21.740]  got the tommy robinson march happening tomorrow i mean this is the people people in london are
[01:41:21.740 --> 01:41:27.500]  really amped up right now paul they're hitting the streets every day well this is the thing i mean
[01:41:27.500 --> 01:41:33.020]  there's there's some worthwhile protest another's not so worthwhile the idea of protest now you know
[01:41:33.020 --> 01:41:38.380]  20 20 30 years ago the idea of taking part in a giant mass protest was seen as something that was
[01:41:38.380 --> 01:41:45.980]  still quite rare like 20 30 years ago now it's literally every single weekend okay these aren't
[01:41:45.980 --> 01:41:51.820]  working class people i was at the remain protest for staying in the EU you know overriding democracy
[01:41:51.820 --> 01:41:58.460]  ignoring the vote it was all like old people old white people like 60 70 years old it was very odd
[01:41:58.460 --> 01:42:02.300]  because of course the propaganda is oh young people voted against this this is all a young
[01:42:02.300 --> 01:42:07.580]  people's movement it really wasn't but literally it's become like a day out for these people it's
[01:42:07.580 --> 01:42:12.700]  not just the fact they get to virtue signal and take the selfie for their instagram feed or whatever
[01:42:12.700 --> 01:42:18.300]  they literally bring like picnic hampers make a day of it meet their friends this is this is like
[01:42:18.300 --> 01:42:23.660]  the new social activity is to have yet another meaningless protest and when you ask them what
[01:42:23.660 --> 01:42:29.100]  they're protesting against like they did today and i've posted all the clips they do not even
[01:42:29.100 --> 01:42:33.740]  know it's the social event it's a virtue signaling event and it's pathetic it needs to
[01:42:33.740 --> 01:42:37.660]  it needs to stop because they're really not having any impact they don't know why they're
[01:42:37.660 --> 01:42:41.580]  really is this is this your footage right here that they're showing is this you out on the streets
[01:42:41.580 --> 01:42:46.940]  with them i tweet that's not me i tweeted that i tweeted that it's basically someone yelling at
[01:42:46.940 --> 01:42:52.860]  a helicopter you need to get out there and question these people paul get into the arena paul joseph
[01:42:52.860 --> 01:42:59.660]  watch and take them down take them face on crush their spirit this fourth of july is special everybody

[01:45:03.260 --> 01:45:08.780]  can be found here in leilani estates but a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we
[01:45:08.780 --> 01:45:14.860]  need to be concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles
[01:45:15.420 --> 01:45:21.340]  and acid rain could lower the ph of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series
[01:45:21.340 --> 01:45:28.140]  of tests for heavy metals alkalinity and ph what we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy
[01:45:28.140 --> 01:45:34.140]  levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rain water next we tested the water from our alexa pure
[01:45:34.140 --> 01:45:40.540]  gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure but the ph was also
[01:45:40.540 --> 01:45:47.020]  restored to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the alexa pure raises the ph of the
[01:45:47.020 --> 01:45:53.500]  water so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply
[01:45:53.500 --> 01:46:00.140]  but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it as the years go by it gets

[01:47:30.780 --> 01:47:38.460]  them they really can endure losing and they just take it now you see the response they get rabbit
[01:47:38.460 --> 01:47:45.660]  out there they're getting violent they're trying to stage events like a trump baby balloon protest
[01:47:45.660 --> 01:47:52.140]  that turns out to be a massive failure let's pull up that image again i mean paul this is a it's
[01:47:52.140 --> 01:47:57.980]  actually laughable how pathetic this is they build this up this kid oh it's going to be a huge balloon
[01:47:57.980 --> 01:48:02.700]  everybody you'll see it it'll draw a bunch of attention it ends up being like a like a 10 foot
[01:48:02.700 --> 01:48:09.420]  deal that can't even get above the smallest building it kind of really in a way paul i think
[01:48:09.420 --> 01:48:16.620]  it's a representation of everything that they are a bunch of loudmouth blowhards and when it
[01:48:16.620 --> 01:48:23.580]  comes time to deliver they can't no precisely in the way it's the way this was framed as well
[01:48:23.580 --> 01:48:28.780]  they framed it as being like a satirical thing which was anti-establishment that was the rhetoric
[01:48:28.780 --> 01:48:34.300]  that surrounded all this so it's literally like some trust fund kid who comes from a rich political
[01:48:34.300 --> 01:48:39.980]  family who owns a two million pound townhouse in london who was behind this this project organizing
[01:48:39.980 --> 01:48:46.220]  it they got immediate approval from the establishment they got a week of intensive
[01:48:46.220 --> 01:48:50.940]  establishment media coverage yet they were all over these same media networks you know
[01:48:50.940 --> 01:48:56.700]  he was on cnn bbc sky news or ever saying this was an anti-establishment protest no it's not
[01:48:56.700 --> 01:49:01.180]  you're not marching against the establishment you're in with the establishment you're flying
[01:49:01.180 --> 01:49:07.340]  the eu flag the ultimate symbol of cronyism the ultimate symbol of the establishment okay the
[01:49:07.340 --> 01:49:13.580]  entire rise on detra of the trump administration is taking on the deep state it's to be anti-establishment
[01:49:13.580 --> 01:49:18.780]  so when you're marching against that you put yourself directly in line on the same side as
[01:49:18.780 --> 01:49:24.860]  the establishment and it's just the hypocrisy of it oh and it's like it's in america it's kind of
[01:49:24.860 --> 01:49:30.060]  more violent you have people acting out you have an antefer and stuff here in the uk in london it's
[01:49:30.060 --> 01:49:35.500]  more like some some soppy like middle-class day out they've got their picnic hampers it's got to
[01:49:35.500 --> 01:49:41.100]  the point where it's basically now a fancy dress party to go out every other weekend in london
[01:49:41.100 --> 01:49:46.700]  and protest about whatever grave injustice has just happened next but it's the hypocrisy i made
[01:49:46.700 --> 01:49:52.940]  the point in my video you know we've had several visits from actual dictators to london over the
[01:49:52.940 --> 01:49:58.620]  past three years the protests were absolutely minimal so you can look at it and think so what
[01:49:58.620 --> 01:50:04.940]  are you protesting trump for oh he said grab him by the pussy 13 years ago oh my god what a misogynist
[01:50:04.940 --> 01:50:12.140]  okay so where were you when crown prince mohammed bin salman of saudi arabia visited the uk on a
[01:50:12.140 --> 01:50:17.340]  state visit by the way a full state visit they didn't even give trump a state visit because our
[01:50:17.340 --> 01:50:23.980]  government our conservative in name only government is so cowled is so yellow bellied they didn't
[01:50:23.980 --> 01:50:28.940]  even give him a state visit they didn't even arrange for him to stay in london for any period
[01:50:28.940 --> 01:50:34.060]  of time but when this crown prince of saudi arabia came a few months ago on a full state visit
[01:50:34.060 --> 01:50:40.860]  the protests were absolutely minimal okay this is a country where women have to have a male guardian
[01:50:40.860 --> 01:50:46.220]  follow them everywhere they have to have male guardian approval to open a bank account to travel
[01:50:46.220 --> 01:50:51.340]  anywhere to do anything you've got women in saudi arabia there was another famous case of it just
[01:50:51.340 --> 01:50:57.740]  last week i believe being imprisoned and tortured for not wearing a hijab oh but who are you going
[01:50:57.740 --> 01:51:03.020]  to be out on the streets protesting against because he's an evil misogynist crown prince mohammed
[01:51:03.020 --> 01:51:08.540]  bin salman or donald trump because he said grab him by the pussy 13 years ago it's donald trump in
[01:51:08.540 --> 01:51:15.500]  their thousands in their tens of thousand you can look at you know erdoğan he came to the uk a few
[01:51:15.500 --> 01:51:20.860]  months ago we've got this narrative about trump being a massive threat to freedom of the press
[01:51:20.860 --> 01:51:27.420]  his anti-media rhetoric it's dangerous it's frightening meanwhile erdoğan a guy who literally
[01:51:27.420 --> 01:51:34.540]  jails more journalists than any other country on earth visits the uk this is a man who before he
[01:51:34.540 --> 01:51:39.980]  even left london on his state visit called journalists that he had imprisoned terrorists
[01:51:40.620 --> 01:51:44.860]  while he was up giving a speech with tereza may literally called them terrorists this is a guy
[01:51:44.860 --> 01:51:53.660]  who's eliminated over 100 media outlets in turkey since 2016 by decree he just says shut it down it
[01:51:53.660 --> 01:51:59.420]  gets shut down you saw the footage in dc i believe what was it late last year his goons beating up
[01:51:59.420 --> 01:52:05.900]  protesters in washington dc so again this is a guy an actual dictator an islamist dictator
[01:52:05.900 --> 01:52:11.340]  who openly shuts down media outlets openly imprisons journalists and calls them terrorists
[01:52:11.340 --> 01:52:17.500]  he's a genuine threat to freedom of the press in his country he visits london visits the uk
[01:52:17.500 --> 01:52:23.900]  protests barely any oh but donald trump said something mean about cnn a few times 100 000
[01:52:23.900 --> 01:52:30.220]  people on the streets that's the level of hypocrisy that's what really gets me every time with these
[01:52:30.220 --> 01:52:37.180]  virtue signaling middle class morons well but think about the optics of this let's let's flash
[01:52:37.180 --> 01:52:43.580]  forward let's say 50 years into the future and you're reading a history textbook and it talks
[01:52:43.580 --> 01:52:48.940]  about the trump protests with the baby balloon okay think about what people are going to think
[01:52:48.940 --> 01:52:56.540]  they're gonna this is a group of mentally deranged lunatics i mean that's what these people are it's
[01:52:56.540 --> 01:53:01.580]  like they don't even think like oh yeah it'll be cool it'll be funny we'll have a trump baby balloon
[01:53:02.140 --> 01:53:06.700]  well what the hell does that even mean you're the ones that are behaving like babies
[01:53:06.700 --> 01:53:09.740]  so it's like it's like what i mean what are they even thinking like what is the
[01:53:10.620 --> 01:53:15.900]  what what is the goal behind a baby balloon like what is the message that you're sending
[01:53:15.900 --> 01:53:23.020]  other than i'm a deranged lunatic the goal in their own words was to hurt president trumps
[01:53:23.020 --> 01:53:30.700]  feelings he's not even in london at this point he can't nobody could even see the balloon over
[01:53:30.700 --> 01:53:37.260]  the nearest building so small but literally that but oh and you know he's nazi he's imposing a dictatorship
[01:53:37.260 --> 01:53:42.300]  you know where we had president shijin ping of china visit a few years ago to london again on a
[01:53:42.300 --> 01:53:47.660]  state visit this is a guy who's literally trying to abolish presidential term limits he jails his
[01:53:47.660 --> 01:53:53.260]  political rivals he puts dissenters in prison they're tortured to death people who lived during the
[01:53:53.260 --> 01:53:57.900]  mau era and now saying that this guy could be bringing that kind of level of tyranny back
[01:53:57.900 --> 01:54:01.580]  oh yeah not the chinese dictator that just got more power than mau ever had
[01:54:02.460 --> 01:54:08.140]  yeah yeah and he visits and who's out on the streets now obviously you know i don't expect
[01:54:08.140 --> 01:54:13.500]  people to protest absolutely everybody who visits but just have some intellectual consistency
[01:54:14.140 --> 01:54:18.860]  for god's sake how can they have intellectual consistency when they don't even have intellect
[01:54:18.860 --> 01:54:26.300]  paul exactly it's a tough one isn't it but it's just like the trump balloon it almost ended up
[01:54:26.300 --> 01:54:31.340]  being like a a celebration of trump if you think about i mean all these people came out with a
[01:54:31.340 --> 01:54:38.220]  oh balloon oh yeah i mean you also had green day you remember the green day song american idiot
[01:54:38.220 --> 01:54:43.260]  you know it's like over 10 years old now but they bought it and so they made it go to number one in
[01:54:43.260 --> 01:54:48.780]  the uk charts you read the lyrics of this green day song which i remember from you know 10 years
[01:54:48.780 --> 01:54:54.780]  ago the lyrics can you hear the sound of hysteria one nation controlled by the media this is a song
[01:54:54.780 --> 01:55:01.180]  about how the media whips up hysteria and controls the nation with propaganda the exact same rhetoric
[01:55:01.180 --> 01:55:05.900]  the exact same narrative that trump says that literally every rally he attends so they made
[01:55:05.900 --> 01:55:12.060]  a pro trump song go to number one and thought that they'd owned trump by doing so i mean the
[01:55:12.060 --> 01:55:16.940]  sheer lack of intelligence is is shocking to behold you know and that that's kind of another
[01:55:16.940 --> 01:55:23.100]  story in and of itself paul where you know you've got all these people in the entertainment industry
[01:55:23.100 --> 01:55:29.260]  that would have you believe that their anti-establishment you know write lyrics about being anti-establishment
[01:55:29.260 --> 01:55:34.060]  maybe say something about anti-establishment corruption in government and then trump comes
[01:55:34.060 --> 01:55:38.540]  along he's the epitome of everything that's against the establishment everything that's
[01:55:38.540 --> 01:55:44.620]  against the corporate fake news and they hate him i mean it's like it's like you know what's
[01:55:44.620 --> 01:55:49.500]  going on you've called it out and then trump is everything that it it's not he's everything that
[01:55:49.500 --> 01:55:55.740]  fights the corporate mainstream fake news and i don't understand it like do they really not get it
[01:55:55.740 --> 01:56:00.860]  or do they fall for the fake news or are they owned by someone and how do you explain that
[01:56:00.860 --> 01:56:06.300]  because green day hates trump and and yet they write about the fake news that jostles up all the
[01:56:06.300 --> 01:56:12.460]  hysteria well obviously they know i win that as soon as they even if they don't criticize trump
[01:56:12.460 --> 01:56:17.500]  which is this is what taylor swift got heat for for you know like two years at this point
[01:56:17.500 --> 01:56:22.620]  for not attacking trump even if they just try to stay out of it they know as long as they don't get
[01:56:22.620 --> 01:56:27.900]  on board with with the rhetoric with the narrative their careers will be ruined i mean this is why
[01:56:27.900 --> 01:56:32.780]  we literally had to have secret societies of conservatives in hollywood back a few years ago
[01:56:32.780 --> 01:56:37.660]  before even those were disbanded because they couldn't let slip that they were even conservatives
[01:56:37.660 --> 01:56:43.740]  you know james woods great actor being in numerous massive films in the 70s and 80s he basically can
[01:56:43.740 --> 01:56:48.780]  never work again in hollywood now because he's a conservative so they know that these people are
[01:56:48.780 --> 01:56:54.140]  savage and they will ruin your career if you dare step out of line once oh but they're the
[01:56:54.140 --> 01:56:58.860]  tolerant ones they've got intellectual tolerance again complete double standards but they know
[01:56:59.580 --> 01:57:03.020]  they know how the game works they're not going to risk their precious careers
[01:57:03.020 --> 01:57:08.220]  so they're supreme hypocrites every single time you know and here's a perfect example you bring
[01:57:08.220 --> 01:57:14.300]  up taylor swift let me just explain something uh let's just compare taylor swift and cardi b
[01:57:14.300 --> 01:57:22.700]  cardi b total establishment pawn uh total illuminati puppet okay she has to be anti whatever
[01:57:22.700 --> 01:57:27.100]  to go with the message taylor swift doesn't have to you know why she writes her own music
[01:57:27.100 --> 01:57:32.220]  she writes her own lyrics she produces her own album so they can't shut her down whereas everyone
[01:57:32.220 --> 01:57:36.940]  else in the media is run and operated by someone else so that's what it's all about that's why they
[01:57:36.940 --> 01:57:40.940]  can't beat info wars that's why they can't beat trump that's why they can't beat taylor swift
[01:57:40.940 --> 01:57:48.860]  we're self-made bitch learn it get it and lose to it every time we've taken thousands of years of
[01:57:48.860 --> 01:57:54.300]  known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very

[02:00:18.460 --> 02:00:30.860]  media savaging the lies of the democrat party you know what's amazing all of the well let's just say
[02:00:30.860 --> 02:00:37.180]  cowardly republicans that have been afraid to speak up on the hill during these congressional
[02:00:37.180 --> 02:00:43.100]  hearings are now getting fed up and starting to take the gloves off and i've got a bunch of clips
[02:00:43.100 --> 02:00:50.780]  we're going to get to of the peter stroke testimony in this third hour but first you know this is
[02:00:50.780 --> 02:00:56.940]  really not up for debate democrat run cities across the nation are the most impoverished
[02:00:56.940 --> 02:01:05.260]  cities in america democrat run cities in america are the most crime ridden cities in america democrat
[02:01:05.260 --> 02:01:14.220]  run cities in america are the most disgusting foul state when it comes to just optics and health
[02:01:14.940 --> 02:01:22.060]  than any other places in america it's always run by democrats take a look at a recent report when
[02:01:22.060 --> 02:01:29.740]  it comes to what the democrats have done to san francisco tourist turning away from the city by
[02:01:29.740 --> 02:01:36.460]  the bay a major convention pulls out of san francisco saying its members don't feel safe on the streets
[02:01:36.460 --> 02:01:41.660]  good evening i'm elisabeth cook i'm ellen martin locals know it and visitors are shocked by it the
[02:01:41.660 --> 02:01:47.740]  reality of san francisco streets is a far cry from its postcard image now the city just lost out
[02:01:47.740 --> 02:01:54.300]  on a huge moneymaker kpi xy is now causing the city money leaving town and might not be the last
[02:01:54.300 --> 02:02:01.100]  film in very well might now that's right headquarters i'm standing in the middle of the san francisco
[02:02:01.100 --> 02:02:05.820]  streets i've stepped in human feces on five different occasions just walking one block
[02:02:05.820 --> 02:02:10.300]  i also stepped on a dirty needle i actually have to go to the hospital now i'm gonna have to conclude
[02:02:10.300 --> 02:02:13.740]  this broadcast because i got pricked with a dirty needle on the streets of san francisco
[02:02:13.740 --> 02:02:19.580]  san francisco's famed cable cars but these days chances are it's the image of someone begging
[02:02:19.580 --> 02:02:24.780]  or dancing in the circles or just wandering around the streets intoxicated or mentally ill
[02:02:24.780 --> 02:02:29.820]  those are the images that tourists are taking home you can smell it like a third world country but
[02:02:29.820 --> 02:02:34.860]  it's not as bad as these and now it's seriously affecting the city's biggest business tourism
[02:02:35.420 --> 02:02:39.260]  they feel their safety is at risk because they're seeing so many people that are having issues
[02:02:39.260 --> 02:02:43.340]  they see people laying on the streets there's there's a bunch of bombs going on the streets
[02:02:43.340 --> 02:02:48.620]  tourism is a nine billion dollar a year industry in san francisco so officials have been reluctant
[02:02:48.620 --> 02:02:54.300]  to go public with the problems in part because it makes the city look bad and it's bad for business
[02:02:54.300 --> 02:03:01.020]  you know restaurants taxis people spend more money outside a hotel than inside and for that reason
[02:03:01.020 --> 02:03:04.620]  it's something we should all be so so basically the story is all right let's bring it down the
[02:03:04.620 --> 02:03:09.100]  story is this this huge medical conference that used to go to san francisco every year
[02:03:09.100 --> 02:03:13.900]  has pulled out because of the state costing the state 40 million dollars the story is tourism
[02:03:13.900 --> 02:03:20.940]  in san francisco excuse me san francisco is down because it's it's reached just insane levels of
[02:03:20.940 --> 02:03:25.820]  poverty with all the homelessness all all the people in the street the tent cities the i mean
[02:03:25.820 --> 02:03:30.620]  the human feces in the street like what dirty needles just ridden all over the street
[02:03:33.900 --> 02:03:39.740]  and then you you see the images of these these these poor people the homeless people that you
[02:03:39.740 --> 02:03:45.740]  know half of them look mentally ill and deranged and unhealthy and and you know i mean there's
[02:03:45.740 --> 02:03:52.940]  a soft spot in everyone for for these people that are suffering nobody wants that but what happens is
[02:03:56.300 --> 02:04:01.500]  it's tough to explain but it's a mental state where you get so comfortable
[02:04:01.500 --> 02:04:09.740]  doing whatever it is you're doing and getting the welfare that you you can't you can't get
[02:04:09.740 --> 02:04:17.420]  off it you physically and mentally can't hurdle over that welfare now that's your livelihood
[02:04:18.540 --> 02:04:25.340]  and so you're now in this state of consciousness this this state of being where you you can't work
[02:04:25.340 --> 02:04:32.140]  you can't get a job you can't do anything but sit on the streets and beg and and hope the government
[02:04:32.140 --> 02:04:38.860]  gives you a handout and this is all created by the democrats see in america you used to have to bust
[02:04:38.860 --> 02:04:43.820]  your butt to make it into your country to make it in this country so that was seared into your
[02:04:43.820 --> 02:04:49.660]  brain seared into your dna now it's seared into these people's brains just be lazy be a bum live

[02:06:12.940 --> 02:06:20.700]  host olyn shroyer not to get stuck on the story that we covered in the last segment but this is
[02:06:20.700 --> 02:06:28.060]  a story from 2016 from forbs politicians deserve some blame for urban decline and it basically
[02:06:28.060 --> 02:06:32.860]  highlights all these inner cities that have been run by democrats for decades that have just seen
[02:06:32.860 --> 02:06:39.180]  absolute destruction in the inner cities an increase in poverty a decrease in the quality of school
[02:06:40.540 --> 02:06:49.420]  and it's just factual data that it's all run by democrats and it's it's not shocking to me that
[02:06:49.420 --> 02:06:55.420]  they use st louis my hometown is one of the greatest examples of this yeah the democrats have run the
[02:06:55.420 --> 02:07:04.220]  city of st louis into the ground and it's just incredible how they continue to get elected
[02:07:06.700 --> 02:07:13.740]  really makes you wonder but of course it's not just st louis it's pittsburgh it's detroit
[02:07:13.740 --> 02:07:21.020]  it's baltimore it's chicago it's all run by democrats and all of those cities under the
[02:07:21.020 --> 02:07:24.940]  reign of the democrats for decades if they were really able to do anything they've been in power
[02:07:24.940 --> 02:07:28.700]  for decades they've done nothing they would be able to steer the ship in the right direction
[02:07:28.700 --> 02:07:38.860]  but it continues to go downhill it continues to get worse under the democrats it's all about
[02:07:38.860 --> 02:07:49.500]  to change ladies and gentlemen it's all about to change all right where to go from here why don't we
[02:07:50.700 --> 02:07:58.460]  hit the reset button so you've had rod rozenstein come out today and hold a press conference because
[02:07:58.460 --> 02:08:04.620]  robert mewler has just indicted 12 new russians claiming that they worked in a russian military
[02:08:04.620 --> 02:08:11.180]  operation to undermine the us election and hack into democrat servers and even tried to hack into
[02:08:11.180 --> 02:08:15.100]  the election systems even though they can't prove it and they they they won't say if they changed
[02:08:15.100 --> 02:08:23.740]  any votes they've said that in fact they didn't but what's interesting about this now they're
[02:08:23.740 --> 02:08:31.900]  claiming to know that it was russians who coordinated with dc leaks and gucifer 2.0
[02:08:31.900 --> 02:08:39.820]  and it was russians that hacked the dnc and the d triple c and the hillary campaign
[02:08:41.340 --> 02:08:48.700]  which is an incredible conclusion to reach considering the aforementioned entities the dnc
[02:08:48.700 --> 02:08:52.940]  the d triple c and the hillary clinton campaign did not turn over their servers
[02:08:55.100 --> 02:08:58.860]  so how is it that rob mewler and rod rozenstein
[02:08:58.860 --> 02:09:07.660]  can tell us that the dnc and the d triple c were hacked by russians when they refused
[02:09:07.660 --> 02:09:15.260]  to turn the servers over wonder if we'll ever get an answer to that question
[02:09:17.180 --> 02:09:22.620]  so of course they release this indictment and have this press conference on the eve
[02:09:22.620 --> 02:09:27.420]  of president trump and president putin's summit first time they've had a one-on-one summit
[02:09:27.420 --> 02:09:38.380]  but you know i think that they're scared to death of putin and they know that president trump
[02:09:38.380 --> 02:09:43.740]  and president putin will be having good faith negotiations and conversations
[02:09:45.020 --> 02:09:51.260]  and you have to understand that the democrats and the corporate media in this country
[02:09:51.260 --> 02:10:01.580]  have become so untrustworthy that they know that president trump will trust president
[02:10:01.580 --> 02:10:09.180]  putin more than them and so he doesn't care if cnn and msnbc and the democrats want to sit here
[02:10:09.180 --> 02:10:13.820]  and cry russian collusion for two straight years without any evidence he's gonna go meet with putin
[02:10:14.540 --> 02:10:20.060]  he's gonna say all right you know what they're saying i know what they're saying what is really
[02:10:20.060 --> 02:10:25.340]  going on here is there anything and my guess is putin will most likely say look i mean yeah we've
[02:10:25.340 --> 02:10:29.820]  got russian hackers and trolls and everything and they do their thing and i don't really know i don't
[02:10:29.820 --> 02:10:37.500]  really care well what about this claim that there is a military operation and putin might say well
[02:10:37.500 --> 02:10:43.740]  you know we do have some stuff or he might say no there has nothing to do with that but president
[02:10:43.740 --> 02:10:52.380]  trump has now been put in a situation by the democrats and by the corporate media to negotiate
[02:10:52.380 --> 02:10:58.860]  in good faith with putin and to be more trustworthy of putin because all they do is lie and they've
[02:10:58.860 --> 02:11:03.820]  been lying about trump since the day he decided to run for president so so that hasn't changed
[02:11:05.020 --> 02:11:10.220]  so now on the eve of trump and putin set to meet the democrats in the deep state
[02:11:10.220 --> 02:11:16.460]  put out this story of 13 russian indictments claim the russian military is is meddling in
[02:11:16.460 --> 02:11:22.940]  our elections hacking all of these servers why are the democrat servers so wide open anyway
[02:11:22.940 --> 02:11:29.340]  and why is it that the information in the documents that they released was so damning
[02:11:30.540 --> 02:11:37.420]  so they cannot win they they they have no means to a victory with this story
[02:11:37.420 --> 02:11:43.580]  let's say that it's true and the russians hacked the dnc and the d triple c okay well tell us how
[02:11:43.580 --> 02:11:48.620]  you found that out because they won't turn over the servers so to quote obama what magic wand do you
[02:11:48.620 --> 02:11:57.980]  have and then okay well what information was released because of the alleged hacking from
[02:11:57.980 --> 02:12:04.460]  the russians what is in these documents that was so damning to hillary clinton in the election
[02:12:04.460 --> 02:12:10.940]  oh she rigged it from bernie oh they think that their voters are dumb efforts oh they were rigging
[02:12:10.940 --> 02:12:18.300]  presidential debates oh they have 60 000 pizza parties oh they have pizza related maps oh they
[02:12:18.300 --> 02:12:25.020]  have hot tub parties with little children in it for your entertainment oh oh oh that's what's
[02:12:25.020 --> 02:12:36.620]  going on oh they have spirit cookings and i'm supposed to be mad that russia exposed how sick
[02:12:37.260 --> 02:12:46.140]  the heads of the democrat party are i'm supposed to be mad that russia has exposed how the democrats
[02:12:46.140 --> 02:12:51.580]  rig elections how the democrats rig the media collude with the media
[02:12:51.580 --> 02:12:59.100]  how they think about their voters how they think about the american people i'm supposed to be mad
[02:13:00.140 --> 02:13:07.580]  that the russians or i guess well you know they say it was a spearfishing attack it for
[02:13:07.580 --> 02:13:14.540]  for the d triple c so i guess that's like the podesta emails but i'm supposed to be mad now
[02:13:14.540 --> 02:13:20.300]  that thanks to these hackers i know that the podesta's and the clintons are into spirit
[02:13:20.300 --> 02:13:30.300]  cookings where they rub excuse me semen and urine and feces on the wall with messages where they cut
[02:13:30.300 --> 02:13:39.260]  themselves spirit cookings satan worshipers and i'm supposed to be mad at the russians
[02:13:39.260 --> 02:13:51.660]  well hate to tell you i'm not in fact i like it i like the fact that democrat adam schiff
[02:13:51.660 --> 02:13:59.100]  is such a low iq individual who cries russian collusion all day long and then as soon as he
[02:13:59.100 --> 02:14:05.020]  gets a phone call from somebody he thinks is a russian agent with dirt on trump what does he do
[02:14:05.020 --> 02:14:13.820]  he jumps the hurdles to get that intel and it turns out he was duped that's all these people
[02:14:15.900 --> 02:14:23.100]  they're all duped they're all tiny iq morons that have somehow gotten into our government

[02:20:17.340 --> 02:20:28.380]  Robert Mueller and Rob Rosenstein are trying to undermine the trump putin summit after all these
[02:20:28.380 --> 02:20:36.780]  are un-american traitorous treasonous actors here Mueller and Rosenstein that are trying to divert
[02:20:36.780 --> 02:20:42.940]  attention from their own corruption and trying to sabotage what would be good fake negotiate
[02:20:42.940 --> 02:20:48.300]  negotiations between trump and putin really sick sad twisted stuff that these two are up to
[02:20:48.300 --> 02:20:55.180]  you have to wonder why and the story is at info wars dot com nsa specialist contradict
[02:20:55.180 --> 02:21:01.580]  Rosenstein's dnc russian hacking claim this is how brazen they are ladies and gentlemen
[02:21:02.460 --> 02:21:10.860]  this is how brazen Mueller and Rosenstein are they know anybody who knows anything about this
[02:21:10.860 --> 02:21:20.940]  story knows that the dnc and the d triple c refused to turn their servers over to the fbi
[02:21:20.940 --> 02:21:29.180]  therefore they could never investigate as to who indeed hacked and any intel and investigation
[02:21:29.180 --> 02:21:36.140]  that has already been done has all concluded the same thing which is it was an internal job
[02:21:36.140 --> 02:21:44.780]  not an external job and that is all highlighted in the story at info wars dot com right now
[02:21:45.740 --> 02:21:57.180]  so do not be fooled this is a 110 deep state sabotage of trump and putin meeting for the
[02:21:57.180 --> 02:22:08.060]  first time one-on-one 110 percent there is nothing that will come from these indictments zero zero
[02:22:08.060 --> 02:22:16.140]  zero in fact oh my gosh oh my gosh i just realized what's actually gonna happen
[02:22:16.140 --> 02:22:27.180]  oh they they are so screwed oh they're so screwed man here's what's going to happen
[02:22:27.180 --> 02:22:33.180]  the russians are going to show up for court again and demand discovery and Mueller is going to bail
[02:22:37.260 --> 02:22:41.020]  history repeats itself folks oh my god i just can't i mean this is just
[02:22:41.020 --> 02:22:47.580]  just devastating victory after victory and these scumbags don't know what to do
[02:22:48.140 --> 02:22:53.420]  they have no idea what to do just like the son that ran the story about trump and teresa may
[02:22:53.980 --> 02:22:58.620]  oh and then trump says oh you want to run that fake news story guess what i've got the tapes
[02:22:59.660 --> 02:23:07.100]  to prove that you tried to smear me ah what did he say to james comey hope there aren't tapes
[02:23:07.100 --> 02:23:15.420]  president trump has all of you beat you see you thought because you were able to get away with
[02:23:15.420 --> 02:23:21.100]  everything and everything was so corrupt that you were untouchable and you had a hubris well
[02:23:21.100 --> 02:23:26.300]  it was a false hubris you're a low iq nitwit president trump is a stable genius and he's
[02:23:26.300 --> 02:23:30.780]  running laps around you and you're just trying to figure out what the hell's going on you're dizzy
[02:23:30.780 --> 02:23:37.660]  so what do you do you you announce more fake indictments from your fake russia probe
[02:23:38.220 --> 02:23:46.300]  to sabotage trump putin summit it's not going to go well for you so keep digging that hole baby
[02:23:46.300 --> 02:23:52.540]  keep digging your hole let's now begin to go to some of these clips from the peter stroke
[02:23:52.540 --> 02:23:58.460]  testimony yesterday let's start with trey gowdy hitting peter stroke hard and your testimony
[02:23:58.460 --> 02:24:03.580]  is bob moeller did not kick you off because of the content of your text he kicked you off because
[02:24:03.580 --> 02:24:08.700]  of some appearance that he was worried about my testimony what you asked and what i responded to
[02:24:08.700 --> 02:24:13.660]  was that he kicked me off because of my bias i'm stating to you it is not my understanding that he
[02:24:13.660 --> 02:24:18.460]  kicked me off because of any bias that it was done based on the appearance if you want to represent
[02:24:18.460 --> 02:24:22.380]  what you said accurately i'm happy to answer that question but i don't appreciate what was
[02:24:22.380 --> 02:24:26.220]  originally said being changed i don't give a damn what you appreciate agent stroke i don't
[02:24:26.220 --> 02:24:31.980]  appreciate having an fbi agent with an unprecedented level of animus working on two major investigations
[02:24:31.980 --> 02:24:40.620]  during 2016 yeah and guess what the republicans are taking the gloves off now because they're sick
[02:24:40.620 --> 02:24:46.780]  of your crap and the average republican in congress doesn't want to see this country burn to the ground
[02:24:47.820 --> 02:24:53.340]  which is apparently what the average democrat wants so you're getting louis gomer you're getting
[02:24:53.340 --> 02:24:58.940]  tre gowdy you're getting derelisa you're getting bob goodlatt they're all coming out of the woodworks
[02:24:58.940 --> 02:25:04.700]  now because they don't want to see you burn the country to the ground so we need oh but this is
[02:25:04.700 --> 02:25:12.060]  only this is only the beginning this is only the first dominoes beginning to fall these people
[02:25:12.060 --> 02:25:17.820]  are dead they are just like president trump said we caught them red-handed they are in a total panic
[02:25:17.820 --> 02:25:21.580]  mode shoveling dirt out of their hole thinking they're going to dig their way out of it they're
[02:25:21.580 --> 02:25:27.820]  just getting deeper and deeper let's now go to derelisa this was a clever one forcing peter stroke
[02:25:27.820 --> 02:25:34.460]  to read his own text messages you did a number of text all of the texts that have presented to us
[02:25:34.460 --> 02:25:39.500]  as far as i know came from your government phone correct i believe that to be the case so you've
[02:25:39.500 --> 02:25:45.180]  made no text available from your private phone is that correct that's correct did you ever text on
[02:25:45.180 --> 02:25:51.500]  your private phone i did did you ever text lisa page on your private phone i did did you ever text
[02:25:51.500 --> 02:25:56.940]  lisa page on your private phone similar text to the ones you did on your government phone
[02:25:58.620 --> 02:26:04.140]  by similar you mean what commenting on mr trump or clinton or anything else
[02:26:04.140 --> 02:26:09.260]  political i don't specifically recall but it's probably a safe assumption that yes so it's likely
[02:26:09.260 --> 02:26:14.300]  that they really get those tests why don't we subpoena get those tests your personal phone has likely
[02:26:14.300 --> 02:26:19.260]  similar text to the ones that we found on your government phone that's correct i would say it
[02:26:19.260 --> 02:26:26.540]  has similar expressions of personal belief okay so in front of you have a one sheet of paper that
[02:26:26.540 --> 02:26:31.900]  was presented to you a few minutes ago and i'm going to just go to go to a date and then ask
[02:26:31.900 --> 02:26:40.220]  you to read your own words march 4th 2016 you want me to read this yes please yes sir omg he's an

[02:27:11.260 --> 02:27:19.020]  and i'll preface it by saying this for context uh miss page said not ever going to become president

[02:27:33.980 --> 02:27:38.300]  that there's no meeting in andy mccabe's office i'm afraid we can't take that risk it's like an
[02:27:38.300 --> 02:27:45.420]  insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you're 40 on october 20th 2016 uh i can't

[02:28:20.700 --> 02:28:25.980]  account to find out what else you might have said about insurance policies or about the president
[02:28:25.980 --> 02:28:31.580]  united states or investigation that is a rhetorical question you need not answer and i yield back and

[02:33:48.860 --> 02:33:55.740]  the republican and the democrat party engaged you had your street minions out there trying to
[02:33:55.740 --> 02:34:01.820]  intimidate and bully people you had your deep state agents trying to run operations to stop him
[02:34:02.380 --> 02:34:09.900]  spying on president trump and guess what you're still lost you cheated in about five or six
[02:34:09.900 --> 02:34:17.340]  different ways and you still lost you need to get the message god is in control and if you want to

[02:34:31.420 --> 02:34:35.740]  let's go to clip nine this is bob goodlatt again another example of a republican who you would
[02:34:35.740 --> 02:34:41.420]  never hear talk like this before they're sick and tired of it they're taking the gloves off
[02:34:41.420 --> 02:34:47.500]  they're getting engaged as patriots for truth and justice let's go to bob goodlatt questioning peter
[02:34:47.500 --> 02:34:55.820]  stroke i separated out my personal beliefs from any action i took officially as an fbi agent every
[02:34:55.820 --> 02:35:01.740]  day do you do you recognize how your vitriol against president trump makes it appear you
[02:35:01.740 --> 02:35:07.980]  could never approach the case in a fair-minded manner sir of course i appreciate that i understand
[02:35:07.980 --> 02:35:13.900]  let's just write it let's be clear let's be clear they said in the text that we've received we
[02:35:13.900 --> 02:35:20.620]  haven't even seen most of them that they would do anything to stop him we will stop him and and
[02:35:20.620 --> 02:35:29.660]  he's trying to tell us to believe that he's going to be neutral dude we are not stupid let's go back
[02:35:29.660 --> 02:35:42.140]  see on august 26 2016 you texted miss page quote just went to a southern virginia walmart
[02:35:42.700 --> 02:35:51.180]  i could smell the trump support and smell is in capital letters all capital letters what does
[02:35:51.180 --> 02:35:56.860]  trump support smell like mr struck sir that's a expression of speech i clearly wasn't smelling
[02:35:56.860 --> 02:36:01.580]  one thing or the other what i was commenting on is living in northern virginia what does that mean
[02:36:02.300 --> 02:36:08.220]  what i what i meant by that was living in northern virginia having traveled 100 and 150
[02:36:08.220 --> 02:36:13.660]  miles south within the same state i was struck by the extraordinary difference in the expression
[02:36:13.660 --> 02:36:18.620]  of political opinion and belief amongst the community there and you describe that as smell
[02:36:18.620 --> 02:36:23.660]  in capital letters sir that was a choice of the quick choice of words and it's all right so earlier
[02:36:23.660 --> 02:36:31.340]  seen or heard okay so earlier you had texted miss page on that another part of virginia
[02:36:31.340 --> 02:36:39.660]  loudon county which is i think in northern virginia is quote still ignorant hillbillies
[02:36:39.660 --> 02:36:45.100]  end quote is that what you meant no sir not at all that you consider trump supporters to be ignorant
[02:36:45.100 --> 02:36:49.020]  hillbillies not at all so what did you mean by that well sir the first thing i tell you is a
[02:36:49.020 --> 02:36:53.500]  is a proud fairfax county resident there's a healthy sort of competition between fairfax and
[02:36:53.500 --> 02:36:59.820]  loudon second thing i would tell you is that in no way did i or do i believe any resident of
[02:36:59.820 --> 02:37:08.060]  loudon county or southern virginia or anywhere else in the nation is are any of those things
[02:37:08.060 --> 02:37:14.140]  that was a don't you know i was flirting with you understand the implications of this text with my
[02:37:14.140 --> 02:37:19.180]  constituents in virginia over the phone that's my boo i do sir and i would ask you to tell them
[02:37:19.180 --> 02:37:26.300]  that that was a in some cases certainly unfortunate use of words that in no way do i believe that
[02:37:26.300 --> 02:37:31.980]  those things are you're a total jackass working at the fbi that's what it proves if not if it
[02:37:31.980 --> 02:37:39.420]  doesn't prove your bias which i mean you know okay you want to deny your bias wow whoo yeah i i
[02:37:39.420 --> 02:37:43.980]  don't need air to breathe either but that's fine deny your bias even though it's obvious so okay so
[02:37:43.980 --> 02:37:50.700]  you're not biased so you're just a jackass at the highest levels of the fbi so that's just as revealing
[02:37:51.580 --> 02:37:54.620]  as whatever bias you may or may not have had that you're trying to deny
[02:37:55.180 --> 02:38:01.420]  ooh i'm just flirting with my boo lease i don't mean anything about trump supporters smelling bad
[02:38:01.420 --> 02:38:05.980]  i don't mean anything about stopping president trump i don't mean anything when i call him an

[02:50:39.980 --> 02:50:46.620]  let's go to classic donald trump here calling out the sun story as fake news and threatening them
[02:50:46.620 --> 02:50:52.700]  with the tapes to prove it i didn't criticize the prime minister i have a lot of respect for the
[02:50:52.700 --> 02:50:59.660]  prime minister and unfortunately there was a story that was done which was you know generally fine but
[02:50:59.660 --> 02:51:06.300]  it didn't put in what i said about the prime minister and i said tremendous things and fortunately we
[02:51:06.300 --> 02:51:12.300]  tend to record stories now so we have it for your enjoyment if you'd like it but we record when we
[02:51:12.300 --> 02:51:18.780]  deal with reporters it's called fake news and we solve a lot of problems with the good old recording
[02:51:18.780 --> 02:51:31.500]  instrument trump has trumped him again just like he trumped comey he records everything oh it's so
[02:51:31.500 --> 02:51:37.660]  glorious now let's go to classic trump again this one i might have to play over and over again just
[02:51:38.380 --> 02:51:46.860]  shutting down jimacosta and cnn president cnn can i ask you a question uh john roberts go
[02:51:46.860 --> 02:51:55.660]  ahead jim no no john roberts go ahead cnn's fake news i don't take questions from cnn cnn is fake
[02:51:55.660 --> 02:52:00.620]  news i don't take questions from cnn john roberts of fox let's go to a real let's go to a real
[02:52:00.620 --> 02:52:10.860]  network john let's go well we're a real network too sir thank you mr roberts does uh jimacosta
[02:52:10.860 --> 02:52:18.460]  where depends because he is quite a baby i mean seriously you know what has anyone has anyone
[02:52:18.460 --> 02:52:25.580]  put together a compilation of all the jimacosta moments i mean i'm sitting here trying to reflect
[02:52:25.580 --> 02:52:31.340]  on all the different jimacosta moments i mean there's dozens of them i think trump has called
[02:52:31.340 --> 02:52:37.900]  jimacosta fake news six times jimacosta has stood at the back of a loud crowd and pretended to
[02:52:37.900 --> 02:52:44.060]  ask trump a question and then turns out like see he's ignoring me another one he gets trolled by
[02:52:44.060 --> 02:52:50.300]  laura loomer i mean seriously if anybody hasn't put a compilation together of all of the classic
[02:52:50.300 --> 02:52:57.820]  jimacosta moments that that needs to get done because this guy what a loser i mean i give him
[02:52:57.820 --> 02:53:03.020]  credit at least he i mean he commits to his job he's basically the punching bag for cnn
[02:53:03.020 --> 02:53:11.420]  he's now the face of fake news jimacosta is now the punching bag and the face for fake news at cnn
[02:53:14.540 --> 02:53:21.500]  and i hope president trump just gets worse with jimacosta i hope president trump continues to
[02:53:21.500 --> 02:53:31.100]  lambast jimacosta it's so entertaining it's so glorious oh and it's just so refreshing to
[02:53:31.100 --> 02:53:39.020]  have a president call it like it is the corporate fake news media cnn oh we are not the enemy of
[02:53:39.020 --> 02:53:45.020]  the american people we love the american people by the way the american people are racist bigots
[02:53:45.020 --> 02:53:51.580]  misogynists and and terrorists and hate mongers we love the american people this is cnn
[02:53:51.580 --> 02:54:00.860]  fake news jimacosta just just classic stuff oh you know what maybe we will just roll
[02:54:01.980 --> 02:54:06.060]  this compilation on the on the other side in the short segment a compilation of all the fake
[02:54:06.060 --> 02:54:12.140]  news cnn so it's not i don't think it's a jimacosta compilation it's just all the cnn fake news
[02:54:12.140 --> 02:54:22.300]  compilation really incredible so joel gilbert is going to take over after the first five minutes
[02:54:22.300 --> 02:54:31.580]  in the next segment i will pass the baton to joel gilbert and he will host the fourth hour here
[02:54:31.580 --> 02:54:39.580]  here but let's just refresh in case we have any new audience members here
[02:54:43.100 --> 02:54:49.820]  you have the trump protest in london totally fail you have president trump stand up to nato
[02:54:50.380 --> 02:54:57.900]  and win you have president trump stand up to the uk and win you have president trump stand up
[02:54:57.900 --> 02:55:05.580]  against the fake news and win you have rod rozenstein though because of all the winning
[02:55:06.620 --> 02:55:15.740]  with robert muhler have a publicity stunt press conference today claiming new indictments on russians
[02:55:15.740 --> 02:55:21.900]  saying they attempted to hack the us election and indeed hacked the dnc and the d triple c
[02:55:21.900 --> 02:55:26.140]  even though the dnc and the d triple c never turned over their servers to be investigated so how did
[02:55:26.140 --> 02:55:30.540]  that reach that conclusion just wait till the russians show up in court and demand discovery
[02:55:30.540 --> 02:55:39.340]  and robert muhler walks away again just like the first time but it doesn't matter the whole reason
[02:55:40.060 --> 02:55:47.740]  for these indictments to be brought up today is to sabotage the trump putin summit that's all this is
[02:55:49.100 --> 02:55:54.460]  they don't want good faith negotiations between trump and putin they don't even want trump and
[02:55:54.460 --> 02:55:59.260]  putin to be able to sit down cordially and have a conversation so they're doing everything they can
[02:56:00.780 --> 02:56:07.740]  to try and throw a wedge in between trump and putin and force trump to go to russia and scold
[02:56:07.740 --> 02:56:15.420]  them for whatever they did in the election it's not going to happen not going to happen
[02:56:15.420 --> 02:56:26.780]  and again though they don't care it's all about propaganda and putting it out there
[02:56:26.780 --> 02:56:32.620]  for their minions to eat their minions are starving their minions are starving for anything they
[02:56:32.620 --> 02:56:38.860]  have nothing they have nothing they can't stop the supreme court nomination they can't stop america
[02:56:38.860 --> 02:56:45.020]  from having a border they can't abolish ice they can't get their illegals to vote they keep losing
[02:56:45.020 --> 02:56:52.780]  and losing and losing and so robert muhler like a cult leader throws the dogs a bone the rabid dogs
[02:56:54.380 --> 02:56:57.900]  throws them a bone and says here's some russian indictments and they're gonna get all
[02:56:57.900 --> 02:57:05.180]  frothy at the mouth oh i can just hear rachel madow oh boy she is gonna have a cnn and msnbc
[02:57:05.180 --> 02:57:10.540]  are gonna have a heyday over these indictments just like they did the first time and then guaranteed
[02:57:10.540 --> 02:57:15.980]  just like the first time the russians will have representation in court demand discovery and
[02:57:15.980 --> 02:57:24.460]  robert muhler will balk because it's not a real indictment it's not a real investigation it's
[02:57:24.460 --> 02:57:30.300]  fake it's a witch hunt it's a publicity stunt they are trying to destroy the fabric of this nation
[02:57:31.820 --> 02:57:38.300]  they're trying to sabotage president trump it will not be done we the people control the nation
[02:57:38.300 --> 02:57:41.180]  not you robert muhler not you robert rozenstein
[02:57:45.020 --> 02:57:49.100]  we all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue

[03:02:27.180 --> 03:02:39.980]  fake news it's fake phony fake a few days ago i called the fake news the enemy of the people
[03:02:39.980 --> 03:02:47.100]  and they are they are the enemy of the people mr president will you stop calling us the enemy
[03:02:47.100 --> 03:02:53.580]  of the people sir they're very dishonest people in fact in covering my comments the dishonest media
[03:02:54.220 --> 03:03:01.820]  did not explain that i called the fake news the enemy of the people the fake news they dropped off
[03:03:02.540 --> 03:03:11.500]  the word fake and all of a sudden the story became the media is the enemy they take the word fake
[03:03:11.500 --> 03:03:19.900]  out and now i'm saying oh no this is no good but that's the way they are i'm having a good time
[03:03:19.900 --> 03:03:25.580]  tomorrow they will say donald trump rants and raves at the press i'm not ranting and raving
[03:03:25.580 --> 03:03:30.220]  i'm just telling you you know you're dishonest people but but i'm not ranting and raving i
[03:03:30.220 --> 03:03:35.420]  love this i'm having a good time doing it but tomorrow the headlines are going to be donald
[03:03:35.420 --> 03:03:43.740]  trump rancid and i'm not ranting and raving fake news is the worst thing that you can call
[03:03:43.740 --> 03:03:50.380]  a journalist i it's like an ethnic disparagement you know we all have these ugly words for people
[03:03:50.380 --> 03:03:56.940]  that's the one for journalists we asked you some more questions
[03:03:56.940 --> 03:04:09.660]  we are in a rick system and a big part of the rigging are these dishonest people in the media
[03:04:15.180 --> 03:04:24.300]  big part of the tone just this guy if you look the hatred i mean sometimes sometimes somebody
[03:04:24.300 --> 03:04:30.060]  gets well you look at your show that goes on at ten o'clock in the evening you just take a look at
[03:04:30.060 --> 03:04:36.060]  that show that is a constant hit the panel is almost it's president trump it's the greatest
[03:04:36.060 --> 03:04:43.100]  president in modern history his attacks on the fake media are so glorious so justified and we
[03:04:43.100 --> 03:04:47.580]  just love president trump for it that compilation is going to be up on the alex jones channel share
[03:04:47.580 --> 03:04:57.980]  it far and wide cnn is very fake news living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is
[03:04:57.980 --> 03:05:03.500]  the real drama can be found here in leilani estates but a lot of us on the big island rely on rain
[03:05:03.500 --> 03:05:09.900]  water and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy metal
[03:05:09.900 --> 03:05:15.980]  particles and acid rain could lower the ph of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we
[03:05:15.980 --> 03:05:22.460]  employed a series of tests for heavy metals alkalinity and ph what we learned was that there
[03:05:22.460 --> 03:05:28.620]  was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rain water next we tested the water
[03:05:28.620 --> 03:05:34.460]  from our alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure
[03:05:34.460 --> 03:05:41.660]  but the ph was also restored to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the alexa pure raises
[03:05:41.660 --> 03:05:47.820]  the ph of the water so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rain
[03:05:47.820 --> 03:05:53.180]  water supply but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it
[03:06:02.140 --> 03:06:07.340]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[03:06:07.340 --> 03:06:16.220]  welcome back to the alex jones show this is the fourth hour i'm joel gilbert coming to you
[03:06:16.220 --> 03:06:21.420]  right from the left coast in los angeles uh you know me as a frequent guest of alex also
[03:06:21.420 --> 03:06:26.540]  filmmaker of recent films in the alex jones store trump the art of the insult there's no
[03:06:26.540 --> 03:06:33.100]  place like utopia and of course the classic now dreams for my real father we will be taking
[03:06:33.100 --> 03:06:39.340]  calls later it's eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine one eight seven seven
[03:06:39.340 --> 03:06:44.300]  seven eight nine alex now we have a lot to be thankful for here we are in the middle of july
[03:06:44.300 --> 03:06:50.300]  fourth of july was last week uh check out this photo of me this is here in malibu california
[03:06:50.300 --> 03:06:54.940]  from the filming of there's no place like utopia from the mountains to the prairies to the oceans
[03:06:55.660 --> 03:07:01.500]  god bless america it's been a glorious fourth of july it would not have been a happy day if
[03:07:01.500 --> 03:07:07.980]  hillary were president we would have had ruled by executive order uh bad economy over taxation
[03:07:07.980 --> 03:07:15.340]  over regulation no jobs obama care open borders inner city crime attacks on police race division
[03:07:15.980 --> 03:07:21.500]  corruption of the legal system imagined that hillary was president and we have two radical
[03:07:21.500 --> 03:07:26.620]  leftist judges on the supreme court we could have just kissed our constitution goodbye
[03:07:26.620 --> 03:07:33.100]  goodbye if hillary was president uh of course hillary would pursue obama's pro russia policies
[03:07:33.100 --> 03:07:40.940]  pro iran ttp the united states would have been finished uh we almost witnessed very close in
[03:07:40.940 --> 03:07:46.060]  this last election what ronald reagan was talking about let's play that video of ronald reagan very
[03:07:46.060 --> 03:07:57.500]  seminal moment play the reagan they remind us that they remind us that freedom is never more than
[03:07:57.500 --> 03:08:06.060]  one generation away from extinction you and i must protect and preserve freedom here or it will
[03:08:06.060 --> 03:08:15.740]  not be passed on to our children and it will disappear everywhere in the world so we almost
[03:08:15.740 --> 03:08:23.020]  descended into permanent liberal fascism under hillary clinton chuck schumer maxine waters
[03:08:23.020 --> 03:08:28.940]  pelosi there never would have been another free election uh i want to give you my take on the
[03:08:28.940 --> 03:08:34.140]  peter struck hearings some things uh were talked about that i think people kind of missed very
[03:08:34.140 --> 03:08:41.020]  important let's play the first video the struck bias video kimony is bob moeller did not kick you
[03:08:41.020 --> 03:08:45.660]  off because of the content of your text he kicked you all because of some appearance that he was
[03:08:45.660 --> 03:08:50.460]  worried about my testimony what you asked and what i responded to was that he kicked me off
[03:08:50.460 --> 03:08:55.340]  because of my bias i'm stating to you it is not my understanding that he kicked me off because of
[03:08:55.340 --> 03:09:02.860]  any bias that it was done based on the appearance now this was actually true this was the one thing
[03:09:02.860 --> 03:09:09.420]  that peter struck said where he wasn't lying and i think everyone missed it there are 13 democrats
[03:09:09.420 --> 03:09:16.300]  on the moeller special counsel probe and they're all completely biased the only problem that moeller
[03:09:16.300 --> 03:09:23.260]  had was struck is because he was stupid enough to text his bias and it gave the appearance of bias
[03:09:23.260 --> 03:09:29.740]  it was a public display of bias that was the only problem that moeller had with peter struck and
[03:09:29.740 --> 03:09:36.540]  that is a very important distinction that i think people people missed uh let's play the next video
[03:09:36.540 --> 03:09:39.900]  on the uh the tennessee congressman very embarrassing because i'm from tennessee
[03:09:40.620 --> 03:09:45.500]  talking about peter struck deserving a purple heart let's play that one purple heart for peter
[03:09:45.500 --> 03:09:53.820]  struck if i could give you a purple heart i would you deserve one this has been an attack on you
[03:09:53.820 --> 03:09:59.900]  in a way to attack mr moeller and the investigation that is to get at russia collusion involved in
[03:09:59.900 --> 03:10:08.540]  our election so we saw about eight years of obama and what was really stealth radical socialism
[03:10:08.540 --> 03:10:13.020]  don't forget obama ran as a mainstream candidate he said i'm going to cut the deficit in half
[03:10:13.580 --> 03:10:19.180]  marriage is between man and a woman and god i'll obey the constitution of course then he went and
[03:10:19.180 --> 03:10:25.820]  pursued a radical agenda that no one voted for and tried to kind of keep quiet about it now the
[03:10:25.820 --> 03:10:32.620]  democrats are back into open revolution uh they tried to keep it quiet for some years but they're
[03:10:32.620 --> 03:10:39.900]  just calling for the most radical policies and so today the democrat party is a radical socialist
[03:10:39.900 --> 03:10:47.420]  party in the open and i believe that's why despite most people very pleased with trump's economy and
[03:10:47.420 --> 03:10:53.740]  things that are getting done i think america remains in grave danger because there will be elections
[03:10:53.740 --> 03:10:58.380]  one day that the republicans will lose they could mess up the economy there could be corruption
[03:10:58.380 --> 03:11:04.860]  don't forget voter fraud by democrats and the next time hillary or cori booker one of these
[03:11:04.860 --> 03:11:10.940]  guys gets into power they're not going to leave it up to bumbling idiots like peter struck or phony
[03:11:10.940 --> 03:11:17.180]  dossiers uh they will no doubt take care of the next election uh and not allow a free election
[03:11:17.180 --> 03:11:24.140]  now i wrote an article an american thinker a week ago last friday that went totally viral it came out
[03:11:24.140 --> 03:11:30.780]  on friday and michael goodwin from the new york post pretty much copied it on sunday and the drudge
[03:11:30.780 --> 03:11:36.780]  report picked it up let's show that drudge headline uh drudge had it for a full day last sunday
[03:11:37.420 --> 03:11:43.980]  that hillary is running again in 2020 now michael goodwin didn't give me credit but that's typical
[03:11:43.980 --> 03:11:51.740]  but the main point is that i wanted to share a view that was able to to get out there and it was
[03:11:51.740 --> 03:11:57.820]  picked up by many other news outlets uh fox and many others and it was really been continuing all
[03:11:57.820 --> 03:12:04.940]  week and i make the case that hillary is running for president again in 2020 and i'm going to walk
[03:12:04.940 --> 03:12:11.100]  you through this and tell you why this is happening later on we're going to bring on daniel greenfield
[03:12:11.100 --> 03:12:15.580]  from front page magazine going to talk about some of his incredible articles but i'm going to walk you
[03:12:15.580 --> 03:12:21.660]  through this scenario uh first thing i'm going to point out is you have to really understand hillary
[03:12:21.660 --> 03:12:27.580]  clinton and how the clinton's never quit how they think and why they never quit her life
[03:12:27.580 --> 03:12:33.340]  mantra which he's repeated and written about for years is this lesson she says her mother taught her
[03:12:33.340 --> 03:12:39.180]  about what defines you in life is not getting knocked down it's about how you get back up
[03:12:39.180 --> 03:12:43.900]  so let's play this hillary mom story she tells it over and over let's play the video
[03:12:43.900 --> 03:12:49.660]  you know i was pretty shy i was a kind of reserved little girl and i would yes i would go outside to
[03:12:49.660 --> 03:12:58.540]  play and literally i would get knocked down and pushed around by all the little kids i ran back
[03:12:58.540 --> 03:13:05.180]  in crying and my mother met me at the door and she said you go right back out there and stand up for
[03:13:05.180 --> 03:13:13.980]  yourself so this is the story hillary tells and for her the defeat by trump was the ultimate calling
[03:13:13.980 --> 03:13:19.900]  that she has to fulfill this destiny and show that she can get back up the clinton's never quit
[03:13:19.900 --> 03:13:26.940]  doesn't matter the adversity whitewater ken star impeachment china gate bingazi email server scandal
[03:13:26.940 --> 03:13:34.220]  you could fill up pages and you also have to ask yourself how come the clinton's have a wrap sheet
[03:13:34.220 --> 03:13:40.940]  that would make al capone blush and they they never go to jail it's because they never give up the
[03:13:40.940 --> 03:13:47.020]  minute the clinton's quit politics is the minute they risk prosecution they know the only way to
[03:13:47.020 --> 03:13:53.580]  stay out of jail is to frighten the jailers remember lisa page wrote peter struck be careful when
[03:13:53.580 --> 03:14:01.180]  you interview hillary she's going to be president this is how they all feel uh so the idea that she's
[03:14:01.180 --> 03:14:07.580]  has the potential to be in power frightens anybody who has any crime on the clinton's now of course
[03:14:07.580 --> 03:14:12.940]  other than running for president she has nothing else to do she's not taking yoga classes anymore
[03:14:12.940 --> 03:14:20.300]  and chelsea's wedding is over so look at her history she's been running for president since 1992
[03:14:21.180 --> 03:14:28.220]  and since she lost in 2016 only by a few votes in a few states uh she really has ramped up the
[03:14:28.220 --> 03:14:34.380]  campaign from ireland to australia to india the campaign continues and the message remains the same
[03:14:35.100 --> 03:14:42.700]  donald trump is racist and sexist and his supporters are absolutely deplorable let's play the video of
[03:14:42.700 --> 03:14:49.100]  her in india from a few weeks ago hillary in india map of the united states there's all that red in
[03:14:49.100 --> 03:14:56.060]  the middle where trump won i won the places that represent two-thirds of america's gross domestic
[03:14:56.060 --> 03:15:05.500]  product i won the places that are optimistic diverse dynamic moving forward and his whole
[03:15:05.500 --> 03:15:11.580]  campaign make america great again was looking backwards you know you didn't like black people
[03:15:11.580 --> 03:15:15.740]  getting rights you don't like women you know getting jobs you don't want to you know see that
[03:15:15.740 --> 03:15:21.980]  indian americans succeeding more than you are whatever your problem is i'm going to solve it
[03:15:21.980 --> 03:15:29.420]  so this is what hillary is up to she's preaching continually she won the 2016
[03:15:30.460 --> 03:15:35.980]  election by three million votes except for that damn constitution thing and russia russia russia

[03:20:31.420 --> 03:20:36.380]  welcome back to the alex jones show joel gilbert from los angeles right from the left coast
[03:20:36.380 --> 03:20:42.620]  continuing to talk about hillary 2020 my article on american thinker that went viral all week picked
[03:20:42.620 --> 03:20:48.700]  up by new york post uh fox news everybody's talking about it i'm gonna talk now about her path to
[03:20:48.700 --> 03:20:55.340]  the nomination uh daniel greenfield front page magazine coming up bottom of the hour uh every
[03:20:55.340 --> 03:21:00.460]  candidate has to demonstrate a path to the nomination how can they get there hillary is
[03:21:00.460 --> 03:21:06.540]  actually the only candidate on the democrat side with a plausible path to the nomination uh and
[03:21:06.540 --> 03:21:13.580]  here's how it goes in the primaries hillary just with her name recognition and her loyal voters
[03:21:13.580 --> 03:21:19.260]  which she has a lot of them can get an easy 25 percent of the vote while the anti-hillary vote
[03:21:19.260 --> 03:21:24.860]  will be split amongst about 10 other candidates at about five or 10 each now this is the same
[03:21:24.860 --> 03:21:31.340]  formula that trump accomplished on the republican side uh in 2016 he had a solid base of supporters
[03:21:31.900 --> 03:21:37.820]  and in each primary he would he wouldn't win it because he had the solid base every time someone
[03:21:37.820 --> 03:21:42.220]  else dropped out he'd pick up about half their supporters and the rest would be split amongst
[03:21:42.220 --> 03:21:49.660]  the rest so this is a realistic path for hillary that's number one secondly she's the only candidate
[03:21:49.660 --> 03:21:56.380]  with big money raising potential she's had a mechanism for raising money for 30 years and
[03:21:56.380 --> 03:22:01.820]  don't forget she has a billion dollars stashed away in the clinton foundation for just such a rainy
[03:22:01.820 --> 03:22:08.140]  day you didn't really think that all that russian oligarch money uh uranium one money went to uh
[03:22:08.140 --> 03:22:14.460]  hungry children in Haiti you know did you uh the next thing is the media they're gonna celebrate
[03:22:14.460 --> 03:22:20.540]  hillary they're gonna give her 10 billion of free media earned advertising and they'll say that she
[03:22:20.540 --> 03:22:26.140]  doesn't back down she was robbed by the russians uh she has unfinished business she's gonna break the
[03:22:26.140 --> 03:22:32.140]  glass ceiling uh you know round two between hillary and trump she's doing it for women
[03:22:32.140 --> 03:22:39.580]  and the msm journalists they want jobs in a in a clinton administration so look for the media to
[03:22:39.580 --> 03:22:46.700]  support this effort as well also the electoral college heavily favors democrat she knows that
[03:22:47.340 --> 03:22:53.020]  and deep state leftists are probably going to help her from inside the government leaking
[03:22:53.020 --> 03:22:58.300]  things about trump don't forget that uh tom arnold has been bragging the actor has been bragging
[03:22:58.300 --> 03:23:04.700]  about having some stupid thing that trump might have said years ago on a tape somewhere and left
[03:23:04.700 --> 03:23:10.780]  this are registering voters every day in these swing states uh age is not a factor for hillary
[03:23:10.780 --> 03:23:16.860]  because she's about the same age as trump and uh she knows she has to run it forces her to run
[03:23:16.860 --> 03:23:23.500]  this time because when she's 77 in 2024 she'll definitely be rejected probably for a younger
[03:23:23.500 --> 03:23:29.260]  ethnic candidate uh someone like jill biden said about obama who's articulate and clean
[03:23:30.060 --> 03:23:35.900]  and probably even more radical uh so while hillary knows it will be an uphill battle to face
[03:23:36.860 --> 03:23:43.420]  trump she sees that she has to position herself and that she has a chance don't forget she has
[03:23:43.420 --> 03:23:49.260]  the same opportunity with the dnc the dnc is broke because they spent 12 million dollars paying off
[03:23:49.260 --> 03:23:55.260]  russians to write fictional short stories for 300 000 per page the most money ever paid for a
[03:23:55.260 --> 03:24:02.140]  fictional 35 page short story so she can offer the dnc again we'll fund you if i can call the
[03:24:02.140 --> 03:24:09.100]  shots on the debates the primaries everything her pal tom pares she placed him at the head of the dnc
[03:24:09.100 --> 03:24:15.580]  so everything is set up for hillary to make this comeback and you're also going to see that any
[03:24:15.580 --> 03:24:20.220]  potentially good democrat candidates are going to say wait a minute trump is a little too tough to
[03:24:20.220 --> 03:24:26.140]  beat hillary's going to be tough she's got the money i think i'll wait till 2024 so that leaves
[03:24:26.140 --> 03:24:32.540]  hillary with a bunch of publicity hounds and a clear path to the nomination i'm sure the rest
[03:24:32.540 --> 03:24:37.180]  of the democrats would like to also use that to clear out the old guard hillary pocahontas
[03:24:37.820 --> 03:24:44.300]  crazy bernie biden and be able to start this new radical party based on younger people
[03:24:44.300 --> 03:24:53.580]  like the girl in new york um now how else could uh could hillary defeat trump let's play my video
[03:24:53.580 --> 03:24:59.900]  called early vote this is the democrat party voter fraud formula let's take a look at early vote how
[03:24:59.900 --> 03:25:08.940]  they do it do you know if the illegal immigrants vote yes they do vote they do yes how's that possible
[03:25:08.940 --> 03:25:14.060]  well it's very easy you go to these supermarkets and you see these people that are registering people
[03:25:14.060 --> 03:25:19.660]  to vote and they can't even speak english and they sign them up to register to vote they get mail
[03:25:19.660 --> 03:25:24.780]  in ballots and then they just mail them back off there's no way of tracking them here in illinois
[03:25:24.780 --> 03:25:31.580]  we've got early vote and in a lot of the states in ohio florida batta in colorado you do it on your
[03:25:31.580 --> 03:25:37.180]  own time and it's really convenient we're recruiting and training latino organizers we're holding
[03:25:37.180 --> 03:25:44.620]  latino voter registration drives across america we will transform this nation so that was an excerpt
[03:25:44.620 --> 03:25:50.460]  from there's no place like utopia from my film where you can just see how the democrats operate
[03:25:50.460 --> 03:25:57.420]  early vote vote by mail uh you know voting uh online is what they're pushing for no voter i d
[03:25:58.380 --> 03:26:03.820]  of course obama got elected to state senate originally in chicago because every cemetery
[03:26:03.820 --> 03:26:08.940]  voted they have all three and a half million people in america are on the voting registration
[03:26:08.940 --> 03:26:15.820]  even though uh they're dead uh so the potential for voter fraud is the biggest thing that they
[03:26:15.820 --> 03:26:22.220]  believe in including uh george soros and his gang operating the voting machines so there's a lot of
[03:26:22.220 --> 03:26:29.740]  ways that hillary sees a path to to victory uh so that's why i say get ready for hillary 2020
[03:26:29.740 --> 03:26:37.740]  because she will try everything to win the white house don't forget in 2016 she did not concede
[03:26:37.740 --> 03:26:43.100]  even though she lost she wouldn't concede because they were holding back certain numbers of votes
[03:26:43.100 --> 03:26:49.340]  in certain swing states to see if it would bridge the gap only when she realized it was
[03:26:49.340 --> 03:26:55.660]  too much they she went ahead and conceded so all hillary needs is about 300 of the vote
[03:26:55.660 --> 03:27:02.700]  in five counties in three swing states 300 of the vote and by the time the republicans or
[03:27:02.700 --> 03:27:07.660]  anybody figures out wait a minute how can you get three times the number of human beings located in
[03:27:07.660 --> 03:27:15.100]  that county uh the new democrat attorney general keith ellison will call everybody racist and put
[03:27:15.100 --> 03:27:23.740]  us on a uh you know a hate speech watch list so i say get ready for hillary 2020 uh she believes
[03:27:23.740 --> 03:27:29.740]  she's on the right side of history she believes she represents our values don't forget she like
[03:27:29.740 --> 03:27:38.540]  her radical mentor sololensky she believes that the ends justifies the means uh and patriots will
[03:27:38.540 --> 03:27:45.580]  have to rally once again to save america from a final defeat at the hands of a now openly radical
[03:27:45.580 --> 03:27:50.860]  democrat socialist party led by hillary clinton and if she wins they're not going to fool around
[03:27:50.860 --> 03:27:58.220]  as i said with uh text messages and dossiers uh they'll see to it that there is never another
[03:27:58.220 --> 03:28:03.500]  free election 2012 was not a free election obama used the irs to suppress the conservatives
[03:28:03.500 --> 03:28:11.660]  break up the tea party movement 2016 doj irs tried to stop trump and if he does get elected to be
[03:28:11.660 --> 03:28:17.340]  able to impeach him and they're still working at it today so the radical left are are anti-american
[03:28:17.340 --> 03:28:22.460]  anti-democrat and hillary clinton will likely be their leader we'll be right back with daniel
[03:28:22.460 --> 03:28:51.740]  greenfield in the next segment
[03:28:53.180 --> 03:28:57.660]  healthcare reform is confusing but whether it's finding an affordable insurance plan keeping

[03:32:01.900 --> 03:32:08.460]  the big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash
[03:32:08.460 --> 03:32:14.780]  may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the ph of the water to unhealthy levels
[03:32:14.780 --> 03:32:21.900]  to find out we employed a series of tests for heavy metals alkalinity and ph what we learned
[03:32:21.900 --> 03:32:27.340]  was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next
[03:32:27.340 --> 03:32:32.780]  we tested the water from our alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels
[03:32:32.780 --> 03:32:40.060]  within safe measure but the ph was also restored to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on
[03:32:40.060 --> 03:32:46.380]  the alexa pure raises the ph of the water so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain
[03:32:46.380 --> 03:32:52.220]  can contaminate a rainwater supply but more importantly a good water filtration system will
[03:32:52.220 --> 03:33:11.260]  purify it you're listening to the alex jones show we now take you live to the central texas
[03:33:11.260 --> 03:33:21.180]  command center and the heart of the resistance welcome back to the alex jones show i'm joel
[03:33:21.180 --> 03:33:28.700]  gilbert filmmaker right here in southern california coming to you live i want to welcome now from
[03:33:28.700 --> 03:33:34.860]  front page magazine front page mag dot com one of the most brilliant writers of our time you've got
[03:33:34.860 --> 03:33:39.340]  to read all this fantastic articles brilliant analysis you should be checking it every day
[03:33:39.340 --> 03:33:45.820]  let's welcome daniel greenfield to the alex jones show hi daniel hi joel thank you so much for
[03:33:45.820 --> 03:33:52.060]  having me on okay great to have you well your articles have been read and tweeted all over the
[03:33:52.060 --> 03:33:59.820]  place for years let's take some of the more recent ones and kind of get your take starting with one
[03:33:59.820 --> 03:34:05.740]  of these recent ones you called it i love the title the maxine waters marxist minstrel show
[03:34:05.740 --> 03:34:15.740]  and you called her the uh the political blackface of the white left now she said that uh civility
[03:34:15.740 --> 03:34:23.180]  is racist uh tell us daniel why is civility racist or why is it not racist and what is she doing as
[03:34:23.180 --> 03:34:29.340]  this marxist minstrel out there well anything that the left doesn't like is racist we already all know
[03:34:29.340 --> 03:34:35.260]  that and so the left which is largely white finds it very useful to take these black radicals and
[03:34:35.260 --> 03:34:38.940]  use them as the front for their violence for their attacks if you actually look at the history of
[03:34:38.940 --> 03:34:44.780]  race riots in this country it goes back to communist agitators very deliberately going into black
[03:34:44.780 --> 03:34:49.580]  communities finding some people starting riots and then claiming that there's a revolution going on
[03:34:49.580 --> 03:34:53.900]  so absolutely nothing has changed since then black lives matter just the latest incarnation of the
[03:34:53.900 --> 03:34:59.020]  same exact program and it's very useful to take people like maxine waters who does not live anywhere
[03:34:59.020 --> 03:35:03.980]  near where constituents do who is making a lot of money even though she has absolutely nothing in
[03:35:03.980 --> 03:35:09.340]  the way of a real election challenge and then send her out there call for violence call for
[03:35:09.340 --> 03:35:13.660]  harassment of people who disagree with her and then when she's called out on that right away
[03:35:13.660 --> 03:35:17.980]  they claim well people just can't handle a strong black woman but if you actually look at the rally
[03:35:17.980 --> 03:35:22.700]  in los angeles where she issued this call for harassing trump administration cabinet members
[03:35:23.260 --> 03:35:27.660]  everybody around her is white because that's the real truth about the left it's political blackface
[03:35:27.660 --> 03:35:31.660]  you've got a whole bunch of white lefties where the ones who actually go out and kill people who
[03:35:31.660 --> 03:35:36.620]  attack people and then they've got a few of these token black people who are there as radicals
[03:35:36.620 --> 03:35:41.420]  where they provide cover because they're the oppressed you know maxine waters was a millionaire
[03:35:41.420 --> 03:35:48.060]  is very oppressed well it seems like the ultimate evil that white communists would manipulate
[03:35:48.060 --> 03:35:53.180]  uh black people you got to ask why would these black people participate in this you've probably
[03:35:53.180 --> 03:35:59.100]  seen my movie in alex jones store dreams from my real father and i show that obama's real father
[03:35:59.100 --> 03:36:06.780]  was the black bolshevik named frank marshall davis out of chicago and his job was to as a journalist
[03:36:06.780 --> 03:36:12.700]  was to try to recruit black people into the communist movement at that time black people
[03:36:12.700 --> 03:36:16.620]  were no fools they were religious people they they believed in love thy neighbor they didn't
[03:36:16.620 --> 03:36:23.900]  like the marxist idea of the war between classes uh they uh believed in peace and love uh davis
[03:36:23.900 --> 03:36:29.020]  was sent to hawaii by the soviet union he was a russian agent i maintained in my film that he was
[03:36:29.020 --> 03:36:34.540]  barack obama's not only his mentor that obama admits raised him and i believe radicalized him
[03:36:34.540 --> 03:36:40.860]  that was his real father but then obama goes back to chicago 1982 follows in frank marshall davis's
[03:36:40.860 --> 03:36:47.100]  footsteps the white communists recruit him to penetrate the black church groups through that
[03:36:47.100 --> 03:36:52.620]  developing communities project to try to get them into the socialist groups why are these black
[03:36:52.620 --> 03:36:58.780]  people that seem intelligent like obama cooperating with the communist white agenda to manipulate
[03:36:58.780 --> 03:37:03.900]  other blacks well you mentioned obama he's a perfect example he's completely inauthentic
[03:37:03.900 --> 03:37:08.060]  he had nothing to do with the black community even aside from the whole racial issue this
[03:37:08.060 --> 03:37:13.020]  was a guy who had been raised in privilege and even in his various memoirs which as you've
[03:37:13.020 --> 03:37:18.620]  documented are very dubious and very shaky he talks about having to somehow penetrate the
[03:37:18.620 --> 03:37:23.980]  black community get some sort of sense of a black identity because it was not natural to him um
[03:37:23.980 --> 03:37:29.340]  father flagers talked about how obama had to go to these churches to try and pass himself off as
[03:37:29.340 --> 03:37:33.260]  christian because he really was not part of it he was not part of that world he was not authentically
[03:37:33.260 --> 03:37:37.580]  black and when you look at these black radical leaders i mean on the extreme end you have shon
[03:37:37.580 --> 03:37:42.060]  king and black lives matter was basically white as far as anybody can tell and actually the original
[03:37:42.060 --> 03:37:46.780]  founder of the nation of islam is also believed to have been a white man if you look at actually
[03:37:46.780 --> 03:37:52.220]  the old nacp leaders some of these people are basically indistinguishable from light but even
[03:37:52.220 --> 03:37:56.140]  today the black leaders that they tried out for the camera because it's hard on now everybody's
[03:37:56.140 --> 03:38:01.020]  on television you can't just take a white guy and say he's black even if you look at them now a lot
[03:38:01.020 --> 03:38:05.580]  of these people are very much outside the black community and even the people who came out of
[03:38:05.580 --> 03:38:09.900]  the black community they're quickly detached from it like maxine waters who was very far from the
[03:38:09.900 --> 03:38:15.420]  black community shows in a very nice mansion when you look at these leaders of the black urban areas
[03:38:15.420 --> 03:38:20.220]  they don't live in the districts that they represent well you've been part of the david
[03:38:20.220 --> 03:38:25.260]  horowitz freedom center for some time and i know that david horowitz has many initiatives
[03:38:25.260 --> 03:38:29.580]  where he's trying to expose the lie of the left and how they're using the black community
[03:38:29.580 --> 03:38:34.220]  what kind of progress do you think he's made especially since the trump has been in office
[03:38:34.220 --> 03:38:39.180]  and he's he started out by saying well what do you got to lose these communities where
[03:38:39.180 --> 03:38:45.340]  where inner cities urban america has been controlled by democrats 50 60 years violence poor education
[03:38:45.340 --> 03:38:51.500]  drug culture no fathers in the home what progress do you think trump is making and your organization
[03:38:51.500 --> 03:38:58.380]  is making to to get this message out one of the big ideas that david horowitz set out was that we
[03:38:58.380 --> 03:39:02.300]  actually have to engage with the black community and a lot of mainstream republicans were very
[03:39:02.300 --> 03:39:07.740]  happy to just ignore them and to just let them divide them as a democrat voting block and his
[03:39:07.740 --> 03:39:11.820]  idea was you have to actually go into these inner cities you actually have to expose the crime the
[03:39:11.820 --> 03:39:16.620]  corruption and you actually have to offer solutions so one of his solutions was school vouchers because
[03:39:16.620 --> 03:39:21.900]  the democrat infrastructure is built in no small part on these municipal unions the teachers are
[03:39:21.900 --> 03:39:26.940]  one of the biggest of the unions teachers and nurses unions are a huge chunk of the democrat
[03:39:26.940 --> 03:39:32.300]  infrastructure they fund the money they push the money right back they take money out of the schools
[03:39:32.300 --> 03:39:36.540]  and they put into the democrat party and he said you need vouchers and this is something that's
[03:39:36.540 --> 03:39:40.780]  been part of the trump administration program you need school vouchers and then actually you
[03:39:40.780 --> 03:39:45.660]  set three black communities they're not dependent on these broken schools that teach their kids nothing
[03:39:45.660 --> 03:39:49.900]  but how to be leftists instead they're actually empowered to control their education they're
[03:39:49.900 --> 03:39:54.540]  empowered to send their kids to christian schools the church the schools will actually teach them
[03:39:54.540 --> 03:40:00.540]  values instead of destroying their value systems okay very good all right let's go on to the next
[03:40:00.540 --> 03:40:06.940]  article you wrote it's called never trumpers are jumping the shark uh george will bill crystal
[03:40:06.940 --> 03:40:13.980]  john casich the bush family uh even sometimes the new media darling ben Shapiro all never trumpers
[03:40:14.540 --> 03:40:20.780]  what is a never trump and what is their logic in their head as supposedly lifelong republicans
[03:40:20.780 --> 03:40:25.500]  that they're still rejecting this president and his agenda so there are never trumpers who
[03:40:25.500 --> 03:40:29.580]  genuinely oppose trump and you know in any election there are people who have different views and are
[03:40:29.580 --> 03:40:34.700]  these people whose entire agenda was to undermine the republican party to undermine the conservative
[03:40:34.700 --> 03:40:39.660]  movement and they did that by pretending to be within conservative movement they did it by pretending
[03:40:39.660 --> 03:40:44.700]  to be republicans by saying um we just opposed this on principle and now when these people are
[03:40:44.700 --> 03:40:49.420]  coming out like max boot like george will and they're coming out and saying we want the democrats
[03:40:49.420 --> 03:40:53.900]  to win that means there were never republicans to begin with there were democrats who were operating
[03:40:53.900 --> 03:40:58.140]  from within and now they're actually exposing themselves which is a huge game changer because
[03:40:58.140 --> 03:41:02.860]  a lot of these people really defected once trump began to win and trump has exposed them
[03:41:02.860 --> 03:41:06.860]  he's forced them to come out and say we want the democrats to win and this actually removes
[03:41:06.860 --> 03:41:11.580]  a lot of the fake um conservative activists who have actually been slowing down and crippling
[03:41:11.580 --> 03:41:17.740]  the movement well how shocked were you or were you not shocked that john mccain who campaigned
[03:41:17.740 --> 03:41:22.860]  for years against obama care was the deciding vote in keeping obama care was that surprising to you
[03:41:22.860 --> 03:41:27.900]  oh i mean i was completely shocked the guy who went out to the border and shot his commercial
[03:41:27.900 --> 03:41:33.420]  bill the danged wall turned out also to be for illegal immigration he turned out to completely
[03:41:33.420 --> 03:41:37.340]  disagree with all the things he kept saying every six years that he ran for office this was an
[03:41:37.340 --> 03:41:41.660]  absolute the open secret this is something that is infuriated conservatives over the years but we
[03:41:41.660 --> 03:41:46.140]  had this idea that mccain was untouchable he's a war hero we can't anything critical about him and
[03:41:46.140 --> 03:41:50.380]  then trump came in and said something critical about him and got away with it which was a huge
[03:41:50.380 --> 03:41:55.500]  game changer and now all that's left is this kind of wake from mccain's career and this pretends
[03:41:55.500 --> 03:42:01.420]  that he was some sort of hero the reality is that mccain was a complete disaster he betrayed
[03:42:01.420 --> 03:42:05.740]  family members he betrayed the voters over and over again he lied to them and now he's going
[03:42:05.740 --> 03:42:12.940]  out lying to them well so you're you're saying that essentially uh trump has exposed the democrats
[03:42:12.940 --> 03:42:17.260]  the rhinos within the democrat part within the republican party and essentially they're all
[03:42:17.260 --> 03:42:22.940]  being filtered out including uh bob corker and others that were just so liberal uh who just
[03:42:22.940 --> 03:42:27.900]  happened to run as as republicans that were probably preventing the republican agenda from
[03:42:27.900 --> 03:42:32.380]  proceeding all those years we're going to be right back with another segment with the great
[03:42:32.380 --> 03:42:38.220]  daniel greenfield from front page magazine we're going to talk about his next article sex lies in

[03:47:55.980 --> 03:48:01.020]  president trump and then we've got actual affairs like uh peter struck and lisa page
[03:48:02.220 --> 03:48:07.500]  first of all is this a personal relationship or political affair and what does this mean for the
[03:48:07.500 --> 03:48:12.700]  deep state interesting thing is that it's both it's a political affair and it's a personal
[03:48:12.700 --> 03:48:18.700]  affair we just saw shazak's testimony um that he gave but there's another level to it i mean uh
[03:48:18.700 --> 03:48:23.340]  congressman leigh gomer challenged him on the whole you were cheating on your wife thing and
[03:48:23.340 --> 03:48:27.260]  but at the same time he's being investigated for effectively cheating on the state cheating on the
[03:48:27.260 --> 03:48:31.740]  fbi cheating on the government the thing is he was doing both at the same time and that's the very
[03:48:31.740 --> 03:48:37.820]  interesting angle that we actually saw so assistant direct assistant fbi director mckay who was a
[03:48:37.820 --> 03:48:45.100]  close clinton ally actually used lisa page the guy that shazak was sleeping with as a liaison to
[03:48:45.100 --> 03:48:51.020]  bypass the change of command but the level of the various um tiers of the fbi in order to actually
[03:48:51.020 --> 03:48:56.220]  get information directly from shazak about the investigation now when shazak testified he was
[03:48:56.220 --> 03:49:00.620]  very self-righteous he said we have all these multiple tiers all these people would be watching
[03:49:00.620 --> 03:49:05.020]  they would not allow me to do something like this but the reality is because of his personal
[03:49:05.020 --> 03:49:09.900]  affair he was actually able to get past a lot of these tiers and report directly to mckay using the
[03:49:09.900 --> 03:49:13.980]  woman he was having an affair with and this is an example of how the two things inter await they
[03:49:13.980 --> 03:49:19.020]  combine together um the adultery the personal adultery is also a political adultery these people
[03:49:19.020 --> 03:49:25.100]  are not just cheating on their wives they're also cheating on america well another interesting
[03:49:25.100 --> 03:49:30.140]  affair it's not an adulterous affair but it's uh bruce and nelly or some information just came
[03:49:30.140 --> 03:49:35.580]  out that peter strozik admitted that it was bruce or of the doj number four who brought
[03:49:35.580 --> 03:49:41.020]  information from fusion gps through his wife uh nelly or by the way i went to high school with
[03:49:41.020 --> 03:49:46.460]  bruce or i know bruce since i'm six years old and uh it was really a shock to see him involved in
[03:49:46.460 --> 03:49:53.020]  this kind of uh treason against the united states that's the high school photo i pulled uh how does
[03:49:53.020 --> 03:49:57.580]  bruce and nelly or their political affair or their personal relationship turning into a
[03:49:57.580 --> 03:50:02.860]  political affair to undermine the united states it's a very interesting situation because when
[03:50:02.860 --> 03:50:06.540]  you look at foreign intelligence agencies one of the things they do is they go after the spouses
[03:50:06.540 --> 03:50:11.580]  the spouses are a link that's what fusion gps the hurry campaign the deep state was doing in this case
[03:50:11.580 --> 03:50:17.020]  they were using the spouses and the mistresses to route money to um engage in political influence so
[03:50:17.020 --> 03:50:23.100]  fusion gps hired bruce's wife and that delivered money into the family so you had a doj official
[03:50:23.100 --> 03:50:27.980]  a top doj official being bribed by the clinton campaign through multiple layers of separation
[03:50:27.980 --> 03:50:33.020]  and without this investigation we wouldn't even know this and it's it's just the tip of the iceberg
[03:50:33.020 --> 03:50:37.900]  but you see this with um the two affairs that are mentioned in my article um james wolf and
[03:50:37.900 --> 03:50:42.460]  alley wadkins who was a new york times report currently is a new york times reporter um we see
[03:50:42.460 --> 03:50:47.420]  this with the oars we see this with a variety of cases here where they actually are using the spouse
[03:50:47.420 --> 03:50:51.260]  because the spouse isn't working for the government or the spouse is working for the government she's
[03:50:51.260 --> 03:50:56.300]  working at a low level of responsibility or she's outside the government entirely and so you can use
[03:50:56.300 --> 03:51:00.860]  her you can use her to get the key government officials in order to get them to do what you want
[03:51:00.860 --> 03:51:04.620]  in order to relay information back and forth and this is a very disturbing trend because this is
[03:51:04.620 --> 03:51:09.660]  something that foreign intelligence agencies normally do and here you have this conglomeration
[03:51:09.660 --> 03:51:16.380]  the clinton campaign um figures in the um media elsewhere who are actually operating like a foreign
[03:51:16.380 --> 03:51:22.700]  intelligence agency on american soil okay let's take a quick call from uh dean and niagra falls
[03:51:22.700 --> 03:51:25.900]  you had a question about peter struck go ahead for daniel greenfield
[03:51:32.380 --> 03:51:33.420]  okay dean are you there
[03:51:36.540 --> 03:51:42.780]  okay we're going to move on to the next article it's called uh the democrat party fourth of july
[03:51:42.780 --> 03:51:50.780]  statement america sucks uh thomas peres wrote as we celebrate our nation's independence we recognize
[03:51:50.780 --> 03:51:57.900]  that america's promise remains out of reach women health care lgbtq people of color disabilities
[03:51:57.900 --> 03:52:02.700]  inequality injustice everywhere we look we're under our fundamental values are under attack
[03:52:04.620 --> 03:52:11.740]  daniel help us out why do democrats hate america well think about the democrats are the
[03:52:11.740 --> 03:52:16.460]  left what's their whole basis for taking power if america's great we need them who needs this
[03:52:16.460 --> 03:52:20.620]  revolution of theirs to justify revolution you have to say everything is horrible everything
[03:52:20.620 --> 03:52:25.260]  is bad things are miserable we need to overthrow this murderous system that is just starving
[03:52:25.900 --> 03:52:31.340]  babies to death on the border and replace it with us so that's their whole concept it's the
[03:52:31.340 --> 03:52:35.180]  whole worldview they have to say that america is terrible if they admit that things are good
[03:52:35.180 --> 03:52:39.260]  nobody needs them anymore so this is what the left always does the left says that things are absolutely
[03:52:39.260 --> 03:52:43.500]  terrible when we're not in power of course when they're in power things are really great
[03:52:43.500 --> 03:52:49.340]  just ask the cubans or the venezuelans yeah well they look they compare america to this
[03:52:49.340 --> 03:52:55.020]  perfect socialist utopia they say it doesn't hold up so we have to tear it down and start over
[03:52:55.020 --> 03:53:00.860]  whereas i think most normal americans normal people look at the rest of the world and we say well
[03:53:00.860 --> 03:53:06.060]  america has the opportunity the freedom of religion uh as long as the police state isn't
[03:53:06.060 --> 03:53:11.980]  isn't trying to tear us down uh and we see america in a completely different different light uh when
[03:53:11.980 --> 03:53:17.260]  do you think it changed and how do you think it changed if the democrat party became so radicalized
[03:53:17.260 --> 03:53:22.540]  that they're now calling for literally open revolution well you know back in the day the
[03:53:22.540 --> 03:53:27.500]  democrats stood for a lot of the things the republicans stand now always officially um this
[03:53:27.500 --> 03:53:31.260]  they were the states rights party back in the day then they were taken over by the left and there
[03:53:31.260 --> 03:53:35.660]  was a huge shift when that happened uh the democrats used to be a kind of a farmers party
[03:53:35.660 --> 03:53:41.100]  used to be a party of um people who had been overlooked um that's the image they still want
[03:53:41.100 --> 03:53:44.700]  but in practice what happened was that they were taken over by powerful left wing elites
[03:53:44.700 --> 03:53:50.540]  particularly in urban areas um these elites disguised the takeover by enlisting minorities
[03:53:50.540 --> 03:53:55.180]  they turned they created political plantations for black people for various other minority groups
[03:53:55.180 --> 03:53:58.860]  and that way they could still claim to represent the oppressed but in practice what they did was
[03:53:58.860 --> 03:54:04.700]  represent a small political interest class um this class has its own political agendas it has its own
[03:54:04.700 --> 03:54:08.860]  financial agendas it's transnational it doesn't believe in borders it doesn't believe in states it
[03:54:08.860 --> 03:54:13.100]  doesn't believe in nations for that matter um and they disguised this transition under the
[03:54:13.100 --> 03:54:17.340]  guise of civil rights under the guise of we're fighting for the oppressed but in practice they
[03:54:17.340 --> 03:54:23.100]  become the oppressors well you're you're kind of echoing some of the points in my films that
[03:54:23.660 --> 03:54:29.020]  the radicals in the 60s were calling for open revolution uh they bombed police stations
[03:54:30.140 --> 03:54:34.220]  bombed government buildings went to jail it was so evil nobody followed them
[03:54:34.220 --> 03:54:37.500]  and when they came out of the underground in the early 80s they taught the young radicals
[03:54:37.500 --> 03:54:44.460]  like barack obama don't tell people about your marxism keep it to yourself and take power and
[03:54:44.460 --> 03:54:49.500]  then you'll throw everyone under the bus uh at a later stage but now it seems that they're openly
[03:54:49.500 --> 03:54:55.020]  calling uh for the open revolution as they did back in the 60s uh let's go ahead i think we do
[03:54:55.020 --> 03:55:02.940]  have dean back on the line from uh texas go ahead dean hey joe how you doing bud i uh
[03:55:02.940 --> 03:55:07.660]  all right i want to appreciate the work that you do man let me tell you it's about research
[03:55:07.660 --> 03:55:14.780]  anyways well thank you go ahead with the question uh the uh peter struck uh testimony
[03:55:14.780 --> 03:55:21.580]  yesterday now we obviously see the hand that the the left is doing whether be interrupting uh
[03:55:22.140 --> 03:55:29.020]  the congressman and their question and stuff like that but uh okay where do we go forward from this
[03:55:29.020 --> 03:55:36.060]  now um okay thank you for the call uh daniel greenfield you saw the spectacle uh on the
[03:55:36.620 --> 03:55:43.340]  peter struck testimony you saw the democrats cheering offering him a purple heart uh what
[03:55:43.340 --> 03:55:49.980]  are the dynamics that you saw going on and what's next for either the russia investigation or the
[03:55:49.980 --> 03:55:56.380]  spy gate investigation well congress has a limited amount of power especially with republican
[03:55:56.380 --> 03:56:00.780]  readership on the hands of paul ryan so what they can do is ask questions they can sell a
[03:56:00.780 --> 03:56:04.700]  peanut documents and though it's going to be storm along by the doj which is what we're seeing
[03:56:04.700 --> 03:56:09.740]  and they can keep the focus on it but in practice they have only so much power their greatest thing
[03:56:09.740 --> 03:56:14.780]  that congress can do is actually extract information um the real power is in the hands of the doj
[03:56:14.780 --> 03:56:18.940]  unfortunately and the doj is currently being run by people who have absolutely no interest in
[03:56:18.940 --> 03:56:23.340]  further uncovering the investigation uh president trump has a great deal of power to declassify
[03:56:23.340 --> 03:56:28.380]  information he hasn't really properly unleashed it yet in part because the infrastructure is so
[03:56:28.380 --> 03:56:32.860]  basically flawed but as we continue unrolling this investigation we're constantly learning new
[03:56:32.860 --> 03:56:37.100]  and important things and it's a process it's a process that makes people very understandably
[03:56:37.100 --> 03:56:42.540]  impatient because ultimately it's a lawyerism you're getting you're getting new facts you're
[03:56:42.540 --> 03:56:45.820]  pulling out more documents you're getting more testimony you're getting more pieces of the
[03:56:45.820 --> 03:56:50.540]  puzzle put together and it's a slow going process but at the same time the things we're discussing
[03:56:50.540 --> 03:56:54.940]  on the show the things we just discussed in these segments came out of this investigation we found
[03:56:54.940 --> 03:56:59.580]  that about all these connections within the doj in order to clean up the doj we need to know more
[03:56:59.580 --> 03:57:03.660]  about this we need to know who's contaminated within the doj within the fbi we need to know who's
[03:57:03.660 --> 03:57:08.460]  taken money from clinton allies and we need to know that so we can actually clean house and
[03:57:08.460 --> 03:57:14.780]  rebuild an organization that's actually going to be able to press charges okay well uh i sure
