[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:12.464]  And now, the tip of the spear, leading the fight to take back the nation.
[00:00:12.464 --> 00:00:14.725]  It's Owen Troyer.
[00:00:14.725 --> 00:00:19.367]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:19.367 --> 00:00:20.468]  That's right.
[00:00:20.468 --> 00:00:22.749]  Taking back America.
[00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:31.074]  President Trump is standing up for America right now to NATO that's been ripping us five ways from Sunday.
[00:00:31.074 --> 00:00:33.075]  Standing up for truth.
[00:00:34.153 --> 00:00:41.721]  In the face of Theresa May telling her exactly what immigration has done to her country and Europe.
[00:00:41.721 --> 00:00:43.923]  And President Trump is in London right now.
[00:00:43.923 --> 00:00:49.049]  There are some festivities going down, including some Trump protesters.
[00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:52.012]  Let's see what our Paul Joseph Watson has to say about them.
[00:00:53.134 --> 00:00:55.756]  Look at this proud member of the resistance.
[00:00:55.756 --> 00:00:58.798]  He flipped off Trump's motorcade.
[00:00:58.798 --> 00:00:59.759]  So stunning.
[00:00:59.759 --> 00:01:00.720]  So brave.
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:01.920]  Move over, Tankman.
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.242]  There's a new protest icon in town.
[00:01:04.242 --> 00:01:04.983]  Oh, but wait.
[00:01:04.983 --> 00:01:07.985]  I now believe this was the motorcade on the way to pick him up from Stansted.
[00:01:07.985 --> 00:01:09.686]  However, sentiment still very much stands.
[00:01:09.686 --> 00:01:10.947]  Middle finger still proudly raised.
[00:01:10.947 --> 00:01:13.189]  It is rotted administration and everything it ever stands for.
[00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:19.293]  Basically, he flipped off Melania's suitcases and some low-paid drivers who were just trying to do their job.
[00:01:19.293 --> 00:01:20.974]  Trump wasn't even in the car.
[00:01:21.955 --> 00:01:23.537]  Not all heroes wear capes.
[00:01:23.537 --> 00:01:25.639]  Look at this amnesty international idiot.
[00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:31.405]  So we've just unveiled a giant 15 by 3 meter banner on Vauxhall Bridge facing the new U.S.
[00:01:31.405 --> 00:01:31.826]  Embassy.
[00:01:31.826 --> 00:01:37.371]  Yeah, it's so giant that nobody can even tell what it says and it can't even be seen from the U.S.
[00:01:37.371 --> 00:01:37.992]  Embassy.
[00:01:37.992 --> 00:01:38.673]  Well done mate.
[00:01:39.053 --> 00:01:39.914]  Bravo!
[00:01:39.914 --> 00:01:45.738]  It's about as giant as the size of these anti-Trump protests in Regent's Park and outside Blenheim Palace.
[00:01:45.738 --> 00:01:50.421]  And Downing Street, where one person showed up and asked where everyone else was.
[00:01:50.421 --> 00:01:55.525]  It was about as loud as the sound coming out of this protester's pathetic plastic whistle.
[00:01:55.525 --> 00:01:57.286]  You want to keep them up all night?
[00:01:57.286 --> 00:01:59.147]  Yeah.
[00:01:59.147 --> 00:02:00.748]  You need to be a bit noisier than that.
[00:02:04.838 --> 00:02:06.660]  Carnival about to begin, folks.
[00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.444]  Believe me, it's going to be huge!
[00:02:09.444 --> 00:02:10.325]  I don't believe you.
[00:02:10.325 --> 00:02:16.753]  Protesters in the UK have rallied to make Green Day's 2004 hit song, American Idiot, top singles charts ahead of President Trump's first official visit.
[00:02:16.753 --> 00:02:18.815]  American Idiot lyrics analysis.
[00:02:18.815 --> 00:02:21.278]  And can you hear the sound of hysteria?
[00:02:21.278 --> 00:02:23.261]  One nation controlled by the media.
[00:02:23.541 --> 00:02:26.043]  Sounds like those lyrics were written by Trump.
[00:02:26.043 --> 00:02:36.652]  So you got a song to number one that talks about a hysterical media controlling the nation with propaganda, which is Trump's main talking point at every single rally he attends.
[00:02:36.652 --> 00:02:38.053]  The dishonest media.
[00:02:38.053 --> 00:02:38.654]  Fake news.
[00:02:38.854 --> 00:02:40.215]  Well done, idiots!
[00:02:40.215 --> 00:02:44.878]  Crappy UK company tries to get free publicity with anti-Trump virtue signalling.
[00:02:44.878 --> 00:02:46.019]  Backfires horribly.
[00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.701]  We can make a hundred of these baby Trump UK visit balloons.
[00:02:48.701 --> 00:02:49.562]  Will you buy them?
[00:02:49.562 --> 00:02:53.945]  Well, judging by the responses to this tweet, no one's buying anything from you ever again.
[00:02:53.945 --> 00:02:56.847]  So why are you all protesting Trump's visit to the UK?
[00:02:56.847 --> 00:02:58.969]  Because I'm literally a communist!
[00:02:59.329 --> 00:02:59.989]  Oh, okay.
[00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:00.689]  That makes sense.
[00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:03.950]  Did you find Obama deporting 3 million people unconscionable?
[00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:04.991]  Yes!
[00:03:04.991 --> 00:03:05.591]  Yes, I did!
[00:03:05.591 --> 00:03:09.232]  And that's why- And that's why- Where was your protest march against that when he came to the country?
[00:03:09.232 --> 00:03:14.374]  And that's why I also protest- If you feel so strongly about that- And that's why I also protest- Where was your protest march against Obama?
[00:03:14.374 --> 00:03:21.396]  If you found that unconscionable too- You do not have to- And that's why- And that's why- I'm literally a communist!
[00:03:21.636 --> 00:03:24.316]  Are you protesting because Trump's a misogynist?
[00:03:24.316 --> 00:03:27.317]  Because he said grab them by the pussy 13 years ago?
[00:03:27.317 --> 00:03:33.598]  Right, so you must have been up in arms about the arrival of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to the UK on a state visit.
[00:03:33.598 --> 00:03:40.279]  A man who oversees a regime under which women need male guardian approval to travel or open a bank account.
[00:03:40.279 --> 00:03:44.480]  A regime under which women are imprisoned and tortured for not wearing a hijab.
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.860]  A regime which is ranked 141 out of 144 for women's rights.
[00:03:51.101 --> 00:03:54.943]  A man who oversees a regime that bombs women and children in Yemen.
[00:03:54.943 --> 00:03:57.884]  You must have packed the streets for his arrival, right?
[00:03:57.884 --> 00:04:04.327]  Are you protesting because you think Trump's anti-media rhetoric represents a threat to the free press?
[00:04:04.327 --> 00:04:10.230]  Right, so you must have been up in arms about the arrival of Turkish President Erdogan to the UK on a state visit.
[00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:15.952]  An Islamist dictator who oversees a regime that imprisons more journalists than any other country.
[00:04:15.952 --> 00:04:19.214]  A man who, before he even left London on his last visit,
[00:04:19.434 --> 00:04:22.276]  Call those imprisoned journalists terrorists.
[00:04:22.276 --> 00:04:28.461]  A man who has eliminated over 100 media outlets by decree since 2016.
[00:04:28.461 --> 00:04:32.044]  A man whose goons beat up protesters in Washington D.C.
[00:04:32.044 --> 00:04:35.787]  You must have packed the streets for his arrival, right?
[00:04:35.787 --> 00:04:41.432]  Are you protesting because you think Trump's literally Hitler and is trying to impose a dictatorship?
[00:04:41.432 --> 00:04:44.074]  Alright, that's Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:04:44.074 --> 00:04:45.815]  He's going to be joining us at 12.30 Central.
[00:04:48.571 --> 00:04:52.594]  Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
[00:04:52.594 --> 00:04:55.515]  I can sense the supreme victory.
[00:04:55.515 --> 00:05:00.419]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:04.381]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[00:05:04.381 --> 00:05:07.663]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[00:05:07.663 --> 00:05:13.927]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater, and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[00:05:13.927 --> 00:05:16.709]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[00:05:17.429 --> 00:05:21.254]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[00:05:21.254 --> 00:05:27.743]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[00:05:27.743 --> 00:05:32.710]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[00:05:33.447 --> 00:05:37.369]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[00:05:37.369 --> 00:05:44.573]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[00:05:44.573 --> 00:05:49.235]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[00:05:49.235 --> 00:05:55.479]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:59.461]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[00:06:05.672 --> 00:06:07.013]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:06:07.013 --> 00:06:09.735]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:09.735 --> 00:06:11.556]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:06:11.556 --> 00:06:12.517]  It is Friday, July 13th, 2018.
[00:06:12.517 --> 00:06:14.278]  This is The Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:14.278 --> 00:06:18.021]  Filling in for Alex Jones, I am Owen Troyer.
[00:06:18.021 --> 00:06:19.162]  And I... can sense...
[00:06:35.791 --> 00:06:37.492]  Supreme victory.
[00:06:37.492 --> 00:06:43.615]  I don't know about you, but I wanted a worldwide revolution.
[00:06:43.615 --> 00:06:50.618]  I don't know about you, but I wanted a revolution against the corruption in American politics.
[00:06:50.618 --> 00:06:57.202]  And here we are, smack dab in the middle of our revolution.
[00:06:57.202 --> 00:07:05.226]  And you see the minions in the streets, you see the sheeple in the streets, you see the lapdogs and the mockingbird media.
[00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:14.995]  On television, you see the Democrat Party just outright lying.
[00:07:14.995 --> 00:07:28.863]  Truly incredible, as you see President Trump standing up for the United States of America to NATO, telling Theresa May, you have destroyed your country with immigration.
[00:07:28.863 --> 00:07:35.366]  Yes, President Trump is the man we elected.
[00:07:35.366 --> 00:07:36.187]  And he has
[00:07:37.904 --> 00:07:41.465]  Now Ben, I think he's, is he with the Queen now guys?
[00:07:41.465 --> 00:07:44.006]  Do we have that footage?
[00:07:44.006 --> 00:07:45.626]  He's arriving in London either way.
[00:07:45.626 --> 00:07:50.027]  There is the footage right there.
[00:07:50.027 --> 00:07:55.789]  President Trump is getting out of the car and he is set to meet with the Queen.
[00:07:55.789 --> 00:07:58.249]  In fact, this is happening.
[00:07:58.249 --> 00:08:00.290]  Is this live right now guys?
[00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:03.570]  Will President Trump kiss the Queen?
[00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:05.351]  Will Trump kiss a goblin?
[00:08:07.699 --> 00:08:10.681]  It does not appear so.
[00:08:10.681 --> 00:08:17.887]  We also have Rod Rosenstein announcing a special, what did he call it guys?
[00:08:17.887 --> 00:08:22.310]  A special law announcement or something?
[00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:26.273]  So Rosenstein is about to hold a press conference today.
[00:08:26.273 --> 00:08:26.554]  Boy!
[00:08:27.586 --> 00:08:40.109]  I wonder if this has anything to do with his testimony where he got grilled and seared, and then Peter Stroke's testimony where he got grilled and seared.
[00:08:40.109 --> 00:08:47.431]  And I've got tons of clips that we're going to get to from the Peter Stroke testimony.
[00:08:49.008 --> 00:08:50.049]  Truly incredible stuff.
[00:08:50.049 --> 00:08:53.451]  The story is at InfoWars.com.
[00:08:53.451 --> 00:08:56.873]  The evil face of the deep state, the disturbing faces of Peter Stroke.
[00:08:56.873 --> 00:08:59.915]  Now this is actually quite disturbing.
[00:08:59.915 --> 00:09:09.101]  I mean, I guess you could probably take any broadcast that we do here and get funny faces and then we make funny faces.
[00:09:09.101 --> 00:09:15.405]  This is like beyond just the funny face that you might capture from anybody doing a live broadcast.
[00:09:15.405 --> 00:09:17.006]  This is just strange.
[00:09:19.056 --> 00:09:22.058]  This is like, what is this guy?
[00:09:22.058 --> 00:09:24.640]  And, oh yeah, oh no!
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:33.986]  And there's this weird, there's this weird gif where he like does like a little shimmy and has like this little wicked smile and he like puckers his lips or something.
[00:09:33.986 --> 00:09:36.788]  Everybody, here, look.
[00:09:36.788 --> 00:09:44.873]  The overall story for me today, and I can equate almost all of the news on the desk that I have here today, is to victory.
[00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:49.261]  Victory in our revolutionary war for truth.
[00:09:49.261 --> 00:09:53.562]  Victory in our revolutionary war for justice.
[00:09:53.562 --> 00:09:59.764]  And while we're not to the finish line, we are just plowing forward right now.
[00:09:59.764 --> 00:10:09.927]  So if you're watching the Peter Stroke testimony yesterday, which we're going to have all the clips on, on the other side, you're seeing how pathetic these people really are.
[00:10:11.266 --> 00:10:13.347]  So there's two dynamics happening.
[00:10:13.347 --> 00:10:23.313]  The Democrats are being exposed for how partisan and pathetic they are, where they go back to Russia, they go back to kids in cages at the stroke testimony yesterday.
[00:10:23.313 --> 00:10:27.055]  So just total insane behavior.
[00:10:27.055 --> 00:10:31.178]  Interrupting the Republicans during their time.
[00:10:31.178 --> 00:10:37.261]  Just like, you know, a first grader that can't behave themselves that has to go sit in the back of the room or something.
[00:10:37.261 --> 00:10:39.363]  That's what the Democrat Party has now become.
[00:10:40.233 --> 00:10:46.957]  But then you think about Peter Strzok and you think this guy was an FBI agent?
[00:10:46.957 --> 00:10:47.937]  This nitwit?
[00:10:47.937 --> 00:10:50.079]  This fop?
[00:10:50.079 --> 00:10:51.059]  This nothing?
[00:10:51.059 --> 00:10:52.000]  This nobody?
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.682]  This freak show?
[00:10:55.682 --> 00:10:56.542]  This is the guy?
[00:10:56.542 --> 00:10:59.744]  This is the guy?
[00:10:59.744 --> 00:11:05.647]  At the FBI who's investigating Hillary Clinton's email and private server?
[00:11:05.647 --> 00:11:06.608]  This is the guy?
[00:11:08.294 --> 00:11:12.557]  Sleeping around with Lisa Page, who's on the Mueller team, investigating the Russia probe?
[00:11:12.557 --> 00:11:16.501]  This is the guy saying he's going to stop the President?
[00:11:16.501 --> 00:11:19.903]  No wonder President Trump has no fear of these people!
[00:11:19.903 --> 00:11:22.205]  They're a bunch of losers!
[00:11:22.205 --> 00:11:25.548]  They are a bunch of ninnies!
[00:11:25.548 --> 00:11:26.789]  Think about it!
[00:11:26.789 --> 00:11:34.515]  Nancy Pelosi, Maxine Waters, Chuck Schumer, Peter Strzok, you put these people in a room, they can't even hold a candle to Donald Trump!
[00:11:39.485 --> 00:11:44.469]  And they're all being exposed right now.
[00:11:44.469 --> 00:11:50.995]  And so everything you're seeing is our Revolutionary War taking its foothold.
[00:11:50.995 --> 00:11:52.135]  That's what this is.
[00:11:52.135 --> 00:11:56.499]  You're gonna have President Trump for two more years, probably six.
[00:11:56.499 --> 00:12:00.322]  Think about that.
[00:12:00.322 --> 00:12:08.009]  Another Supreme Court Justice, can you imagine the protest for that?
[00:12:08.009 --> 00:12:08.209]  So,
[00:12:10.427 --> 00:12:16.851]  All of the news today, I can equate to victory.
[00:12:16.851 --> 00:12:21.094]  Now, specifically, you look at these headlines.
[00:12:21.094 --> 00:12:24.796]  From Yahoo, fighting fake news with the law.
[00:12:24.796 --> 00:12:28.559]  From Associated Free Press, the online battle for the truth.
[00:12:28.559 --> 00:12:30.940]  CNN yesterday.
[00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:34.583]  YouTube trying to censor fake news, somehow InfoWars still exists.
[00:12:36.667 --> 00:12:41.155]  The Guardian, Hillary Clinton attacks Trump for all-out war on truth, facts and reason.
[00:12:41.155 --> 00:12:46.485]  Ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you the translation for all of these headlines.
[00:12:46.485 --> 00:12:49.010]  InfoWars is winning and we don't know what to do!
[00:12:51.627 --> 00:12:56.868]  Infowars news is completely accurate, and we keep being wrong, and we don't know what to do!
[00:12:56.868 --> 00:13:05.810]  We've tried to call them fake news, we've tried to call them racist, we've filed a bunch of frivolous lawsuits, we've made a bunch of false claims, and they keep winning!
[00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:08.991]  This is not how we made the world to operate!
[00:13:08.991 --> 00:13:11.671]  People aren't allowed to have choice when it comes to news!
[00:13:11.671 --> 00:13:12.571]  No!
[00:13:12.571 --> 00:13:15.772]  If we tell them it's fake news, it's fake news!
[00:13:15.772 --> 00:13:19.333]  If we tell them there was a ship sunk in the Gulf of Tonkin, we're going to war!
[00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:24.565]  If we tell them there was a lone shooter that killed JFK, they buy it!
[00:13:24.565 --> 00:13:27.308]  What is going on here?
[00:13:27.308 --> 00:13:31.333]  Well... The American people woke up.
[00:13:33.356 --> 00:13:47.343]  And we just started to smell the coffee just in the nick of time to get Donald Trump elected, save us from Hillary Clinton, and now get victory after victory after victory after victory after victory after victory.
[00:13:47.343 --> 00:13:52.705]  Feds collect record individual income taxes through June.
[00:13:52.705 --> 00:13:54.046]  Okay, let's see.
[00:13:54.046 --> 00:13:57.667]  How many records has President Trump had in a year and a half?
[00:13:57.667 --> 00:13:58.748]  Record low unemployment.
[00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:01.891]  Record low black unemployment.
[00:14:01.891 --> 00:14:04.852]  Record low Latino unemployment.
[00:14:04.852 --> 00:14:07.133]  Record low female unemployment.
[00:14:07.133 --> 00:14:11.034]  Record number of females in his administration.
[00:14:11.034 --> 00:14:14.456]  How many different records has he hit on the jobs market?
[00:14:14.456 --> 00:14:16.556]  Record number of jobs growth.
[00:14:16.556 --> 00:14:19.217]  Record number GDP growth.
[00:14:19.217 --> 00:14:20.538]  Record number stocks market.
[00:14:20.538 --> 00:14:25.000]  Just records and records and records and just rewriting the record book.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.020]  President Donald Trump.
[00:14:27.614 --> 00:14:33.802]  And what does the corporate media tell you?
[00:14:33.802 --> 00:14:37.788]  Russian hacking.
[00:14:37.788 --> 00:14:40.892]  Russian hacking is responsible for your own freedom and your own prosperity.
[00:14:42.318 --> 00:14:46.543]  And they can't defeat InfoWars, so they keep going back to the fake news.
[00:14:46.543 --> 00:14:50.187]  Alright, so Rod Rosenstein is now having a live press conference.
[00:14:50.187 --> 00:14:51.468]  Guys, let's pause that.
[00:14:51.468 --> 00:14:52.609]  We're going to a break now.
[00:14:52.609 --> 00:14:54.612]  We're going to carry that on the other side.
[00:14:54.612 --> 00:14:56.173]  We'll get to the Peter Strzok clips.

[00:20:31.212 --> 00:20:34.154]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:20:34.154 --> 00:20:38.877]  We're taking America back.
[00:20:38.877 --> 00:20:40.738]  That's why the deep state's panicking.
[00:20:40.738 --> 00:20:46.042]  And the signs are everywhere, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:20:46.042 --> 00:20:47.903]  Quite a feeling.
[00:20:47.903 --> 00:20:50.405]  Quite a sight to behold.
[00:20:53.223 --> 00:20:58.947]  And it's really amazing that so many people are missing out on this entirely.
[00:20:58.947 --> 00:21:01.189]  Not us, not you.
[00:21:01.189 --> 00:21:11.377]  We will go down as brothers and sisters of history, as patriots that stood up for what's right and fought the good fight.
[00:21:11.377 --> 00:21:14.439]  And we will go on till the end.
[00:21:14.439 --> 00:21:16.361]  Guaranteed.
[00:21:16.361 --> 00:21:17.682]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:21:17.682 --> 00:21:19.343]  Owen Troyer filling in for Alex today.
[00:21:19.343 --> 00:21:20.624]  We've got Rod Rosenstein.
[00:21:22.233 --> 00:21:31.621]  The swamp creature goblin that a Luke Anon has said has ties to Seth Rich.
[00:21:31.621 --> 00:21:32.982]  And I will just leave it at that.
[00:21:34.775 --> 00:21:41.618]  You can look at Jack Berkman's press conference and interview with us that I have clips of on the Alex Jones channel on YouTube.
[00:21:41.618 --> 00:21:46.740]  But regardless, he has called, I guess, some emergency last-second press conference.
[00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:47.860]  Nobody seems to know why.
[00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:50.561]  But it's President Rod Rosenstein, ladies and gentlemen!
[00:21:50.561 --> 00:21:52.382]  The President of the Deep State!
[00:21:52.382 --> 00:21:53.022]  Unelected!
[00:21:53.022 --> 00:21:56.284]  He'll bring America down with Peter Strzok and Lisa Page!
[00:21:56.284 --> 00:22:03.127]  Let's go to the fake President Rod Rosenstein.
[00:22:03.127 --> 00:22:03.707]  That's good.
[00:22:06.578 --> 00:22:08.518]  I don't even know how to work a microphone.
[00:22:08.518 --> 00:22:09.938]  I'm the Department of Justice.
[00:22:09.938 --> 00:22:11.419]  Oh my gosh.
[00:22:11.419 --> 00:22:11.979]  Okay, okay.
[00:22:11.979 --> 00:22:13.760]  Now I know what's going on.
[00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:14.700]  Alright, alright, alright.
[00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:16.980]  Pause it, pause it, pause it.
[00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:20.361]  I may have to call an audible here on air.
[00:22:20.361 --> 00:22:20.641]  Okay.
[00:22:35.185 --> 00:22:38.788]  So I'm guessing this is just the Washington Post audio here that sucks.
[00:22:38.788 --> 00:22:40.869]  Have you guys tried to hear the C-SPAN audio?
[00:22:40.869 --> 00:22:43.991]  It's alright, we're just wargaming here live on air.
[00:22:43.991 --> 00:22:45.793]  Because I know what he's about to say.
[00:22:45.793 --> 00:22:47.614]  The C-SPAN is better.
[00:22:47.614 --> 00:22:51.697]  Let's just go live to C-SPAN, because I know what he's going to say here, and this audio is bothering me.
[00:22:51.697 --> 00:22:53.598]  So let's just go live to C-SPAN.
[00:22:53.598 --> 00:22:59.643]  There's no allegation that the conspiracy changed the vote count or affected any election result.
[00:23:01.766 --> 00:23:08.609]  The Special Counsel's investigation is ongoing and there will be no comments by the Special Counsel at this time.
[00:23:08.609 --> 00:23:23.355]  Assistant Attorney General John Demers is here with me today because we intend to transition responsibility for this indictment to the Justice Department's National Security Division while we await the apprehension of the defendants.
[00:23:23.355 --> 00:23:30.158]  Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General Ed O'Callaghan is also with me and he's been assisting in managing the Special Counsel investigation.
[00:23:31.792 --> 00:23:43.337]  I want to caution you, the people who speculate about federal investigations usually do not know all of the relevant facts.
[00:23:43.337 --> 00:23:48.760]  We do not try cases on television or in congressional hearings.
[00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:50.981]  Most of the time- All right, just bring him down for a second.
[00:23:50.981 --> 00:23:53.582]  But now he's like making an excuse for why they won't give you answers.
[00:23:53.582 --> 00:23:56.103]  So this is really incredible what's happening right now.
[00:23:56.103 --> 00:23:57.444]  They're bringing back up
[00:23:58.482 --> 00:24:08.985]  The Mueller indictments of the Russians, and they assume that the American public is so stupid, they're not even going to know the full story, which is that the Russians already showed up.
[00:24:08.985 --> 00:24:12.946]  So now they're apparently saying the Russian military is behind it.
[00:24:12.946 --> 00:24:16.527]  Folks, they're going full panic right now!
[00:24:16.527 --> 00:24:19.188]  This is unbelievable!
[00:24:19.188 --> 00:24:21.488]  They think people are going to buy this!
[00:24:21.488 --> 00:24:24.349]  And Trump's about to meet with Putin!
[00:24:24.349 --> 00:24:25.690]  Oh, this is so glorious!
[00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:26.850]  Let's go back to Rosenstein!
[00:24:29.943 --> 00:24:37.806]  We follow the rule of law, which means that we follow procedures and we reserve judgment.
[00:24:37.806 --> 00:24:39.687]  We complete our investigations.
[00:24:39.687 --> 00:24:40.387]  Unless it's Hillary Clinton.
[00:24:40.387 --> 00:24:42.288]  We evaluate all of the relevant evidence.
[00:24:42.288 --> 00:24:42.988]  Unless it's Hillary Clinton.
[00:24:42.988 --> 00:24:44.508]  Before we reach any conclusion.
[00:24:44.508 --> 00:24:46.009]  Unless it's Hillary Clinton.
[00:24:46.009 --> 00:24:50.991]  That is how the American people expect their Department of Justice to operate.
[00:24:50.991 --> 00:24:55.312]  And that is how our department is going to operate.
[00:24:55.312 --> 00:24:58.694]  In our justice system, everyone who's charged with a crime
[00:24:59.634 --> 00:25:04.256]  Is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.
[00:25:04.256 --> 00:25:04.877]  Unless you're Trump.
[00:25:04.877 --> 00:25:06.097]  It should go without saying.
[00:25:06.097 --> 00:25:08.999]  So Hillary always innocent even when guilty.
[00:25:08.999 --> 00:25:10.740]  Trump always guilty even when innocent.
[00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:21.305]  The indictment was returned today because prosecutors determined that the evidence was sufficient to present these allegations to a federal judge.
[00:25:21.305 --> 00:25:21.945]  What is this?
[00:25:21.945 --> 00:25:24.466]  What is this 1984 universe that I'm living in?
[00:25:24.466 --> 00:25:27.308]  Is based solely on the facts, the law,
[00:25:30.689 --> 00:25:33.363]  It's like I have nothing left but laughter for this madness.
[00:25:35.885 --> 00:25:39.766]  The president is fully aware of the department's actions today.
[00:25:39.766 --> 00:25:44.007]  So they're trying to sully President Trump's meeting with Putin coming up next week on Monday.
[00:25:44.007 --> 00:25:45.168]  That's what they're trying to do right here.
[00:25:45.168 --> 00:25:47.689]  No, don't you meet with Putin.
[00:25:47.689 --> 00:25:49.009]  They were trying to hack the election.
[00:25:49.009 --> 00:25:57.892]  And of course, the whole thing is a joke because they're sitting here with this false notion that Trump is actually working for Putin.
[00:25:57.892 --> 00:26:01.793]  I mean, do you see how mad this entire thing is?
[00:26:01.793 --> 00:26:05.174]  So are they going to go full jump the shark and say,
[00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:10.621]  The Russian military hacked the United States election for Donald Trump to win.
[00:26:10.621 --> 00:26:12.761]  Is that what they're trying to do here?
[00:26:12.761 --> 00:26:22.603]  Because that, I mean, if they're real in their diagnosis of the election being a Russian hack job, then you would assume they have to retreat back to that stance.
[00:26:22.603 --> 00:26:28.204]  But they know it's such a lunatic thing that they're not going to do it.
[00:26:28.204 --> 00:26:31.644]  And so now they're just going to say, oh, the Russian military hacked Trump.
[00:26:31.644 --> 00:26:32.785]  You can't meet with Putin.
[00:26:32.785 --> 00:26:33.605]  Don't go meet with Putin.
[00:26:33.605 --> 00:26:34.145]  They're hacking us.
[00:26:34.145 --> 00:26:34.725]  They're our enemy.
[00:26:35.774 --> 00:26:40.077]  Even though they're telling Trump he is Putin's puppet.
[00:26:40.077 --> 00:26:47.741]  I have nothing left but just laughter for this hysteria.
[00:26:47.741 --> 00:26:54.685]  This lunatic fringe society that the Deep State is trying to foist upon us here.
[00:26:54.685 --> 00:26:57.587]  Trump colluded with Russia.
[00:26:57.587 --> 00:26:59.608]  Let's go back to Rosenstein.
[00:26:59.608 --> 00:27:03.030]  The indictment was returned today.
[00:27:03.846 --> 00:27:11.190]  Because prosecutors determined that the evidence was sufficient to present these allegations to a federal grand jury.
[00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:20.094]  Our analysis is based solely on the facts, the law, and Department of Justice policies.
[00:27:20.094 --> 00:27:24.436]  I briefed President Trump about these allegations earlier this week.
[00:27:24.436 --> 00:27:30.399]  The President is fully aware of the Department's actions today.
[00:27:30.399 --> 00:27:32.900]  On my remarks, I have not identified the victims.
[00:27:34.923 --> 00:27:50.652]  When we confront foreign interference in American elections, it's important for us to avoid thinking politically as Republicans or Democrats, and instead to think patriotically as Americans.
[00:27:50.652 --> 00:27:54.655]  Our response must not depend on which side was victimized.
[00:27:56.152 --> 00:27:59.813]  The internet allows foreign adversaries... This is unbelievable!
[00:27:59.813 --> 00:28:02.974]  But here, pause it, or just pull it down.
[00:28:02.974 --> 00:28:09.816]  Every claim they're making is, the Russians hacked the DCCC, the Russians hacked the DNC, the Russians hacked the Hillary campaign.
[00:28:09.816 --> 00:28:12.997]  So here he's saying, oh it's not about the campaign, or which side, or anything.
[00:28:12.997 --> 00:28:14.997]  This whole thing, that's what it's been from the beginning!
[00:28:14.997 --> 00:28:18.018]  This whole thing started because of Trump-Russia collusion.
[00:28:18.018 --> 00:28:21.879]  I mean, they're trying to pull the wool over your eyes!
[00:28:21.879 --> 00:28:23.240]  This is unbelievable!
[00:28:25.117 --> 00:28:26.317]  So what is next?
[00:28:26.317 --> 00:28:29.178]  I mean, nobody believes this crap.
[00:28:29.178 --> 00:28:34.559]  No one.
[00:28:34.559 --> 00:28:36.840]  Are you having fun yet or what?
[00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:38.160]  Let's go!
[00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:40.361]  It's moving downhill.
[00:28:40.361 --> 00:28:42.981]  It just keeps picking up more momentum.
[00:28:42.981 --> 00:28:47.262]  Oh, but don't worry, it's going to be smashed when it gets to the bottom.
[00:28:47.262 --> 00:28:48.823]  Is it Trump-Russia collusion?
[00:28:48.823 --> 00:28:50.343]  Is it Russian hacking?
[00:28:50.343 --> 00:28:52.584]  What happened to Seth Rich?
[00:28:52.584 --> 00:28:53.744]  Who is Rod Rosenstein?
[00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:57.093]  Oh boy, they are in panic mode right now.
[00:28:59.355 --> 00:29:02.397]  Want revenge on the common housefly?
[00:29:02.397 --> 00:29:06.400]  Well, after 10,000 years, someone has finally come up with a better way.

[00:29:41.004 --> 00:29:46.688]  We're in a constitutional crisis and our government is now being run and ruled by a shadow government.
[00:29:46.688 --> 00:29:50.130]  We gotta get this out because just because you're a white folks doesn't mean other people are.

[00:33:26.335 --> 00:33:29.958]  All right, this news breaking right now is so crazy.

[00:33:40.304 --> 00:33:41.465]  Thank you.
[00:33:41.465 --> 00:33:43.026]  Ooh, fresh brain force, too.

[00:34:31.517 --> 00:34:34.079]  Okay.
[00:34:34.079 --> 00:34:38.982]  This is truly wacky, wild stuff that's happening right here.
[00:34:38.982 --> 00:34:39.963]  Rod Rosenstein
[00:34:41.192 --> 00:34:49.256]  He calls a press conference to best of my knowledge and everyone here in the last like 12 hours.
[00:34:49.256 --> 00:34:50.917]  We've got it still queued up.
[00:34:50.917 --> 00:34:53.098]  We'll go back to it here in a moment.
[00:34:53.098 --> 00:35:04.824]  He calls a press conference and he announces that Robert Mueller has indicted 12 Russian officers and now they're trying to link this to essentially the Russian military is what they're saying.
[00:35:04.824 --> 00:35:08.506]  But there's some weird shenanigans happening with this deal.
[00:35:10.532 --> 00:35:25.998]  And this is why I'm just trying to stay focused and report this accurately because it's so, it's so Twilight Zone out there, it's almost like I can't even believe what I'm reporting even though I know it's true.
[00:35:25.998 --> 00:35:28.139]  So this headline...
[00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:32.202]  Mueller indicts 12 Russian officers for hacking Dems in 2016.
[00:35:32.202 --> 00:35:36.905]  Guys, pull up Drudge Report so I can see what Drudge Report headline is right now.
[00:35:36.905 --> 00:35:40.668]  And is it this Daily Beast story that I have?
[00:35:40.668 --> 00:35:42.389]  Is that a link to the Daily Beast?
[00:35:42.389 --> 00:35:49.515]  Okay, so the Drudge headline, Russian military charged with hacking DNC Hillary campaign state elections.
[00:35:49.515 --> 00:35:53.958]  So they're moving forward now with the Russian hacking claim.
[00:35:55.666 --> 00:35:56.327]  Okay, thank you.
[00:35:56.327 --> 00:35:57.607]  So now it's linking to Yahoo.
[00:35:57.607 --> 00:36:01.330]  So there's a new story on Yahoo from the Associated Press.
[00:36:01.330 --> 00:36:07.034]  But, but, but... Okay, so I'm just trying to focus here.
[00:36:07.034 --> 00:36:11.798]  Let's rewind the clocks back... What was it?
[00:36:11.798 --> 00:36:14.079]  Five, six months?
[00:36:14.079 --> 00:36:14.820]  Maybe more than that?
[00:36:16.858 --> 00:36:42.632]  Mueller indicts the 12 Russians and the quote-unquote Russian entities which were essentially these agencies that was running the quote-unquote social media troll farms which by their own admission and even Rosenstein in this most recent press conference admit that it was going both ways pro-Hillary and pro-Trump anti-Hillary and anti-Trump so there was no real
[00:36:44.807 --> 00:36:45.767]  We're good to go.
[00:37:08.168 --> 00:37:10.209]  Well, they really did the indictments for the headlines.
[00:37:10.209 --> 00:37:12.270]  They weren't expecting this to actually reach a court.
[00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:13.871]  They weren't expecting the Russians to show up.
[00:37:13.871 --> 00:37:15.812]  And then, oops!
[00:37:15.812 --> 00:37:22.015]  The Russians did show up for court, and the lawyers representing them demanded discovery.
[00:37:22.015 --> 00:37:23.476]  What did Robert Mueller do?
[00:37:23.476 --> 00:37:24.637]  He balked.
[00:37:24.637 --> 00:37:25.858]  He walked away.
[00:37:25.858 --> 00:37:33.242]  He then said that he didn't have enough evidence yet so that he couldn't show up in court, even though you don't indict someone until you have all the evidence.
[00:37:33.242 --> 00:37:34.662]  So you know he's lying about that.
[00:37:34.662 --> 00:37:36.663]  He wasn't expecting the Russians to show up.
[00:37:36.663 --> 00:37:37.364]  So what happens?
[00:37:38.322 --> 00:37:57.367]  They just leave that case out there, and because that blows up in their face, they retreat, and then they re-indict the same Russians, leave out the agency's quote-unquote entities, and then bring in different claims of Russian government hacking, military hacking, with specific sites.
[00:37:58.877 --> 00:38:08.239]  And they basically say, we're relaunching a whole new lawsuit because we blew the last one, so we're going to launch a whole new indictment campaign against these Russians.
[00:38:08.239 --> 00:38:13.279]  Now they're going to have to re-lawyer up, and we'll see what they do next.
[00:38:13.279 --> 00:38:26.642]  But this is just another fake victory, Tokyo Rose, Baghdad Bob, of the Deep State, trying to tell people, we got the Russians, don't lose faith, Trump's not legitimate, it's all fake, it's all Russian.
[00:38:26.642 --> 00:38:27.742]  No, you're all fake!
[00:38:28.635 --> 00:38:36.579]  You are the ones that colluded with Russia, with Uranium One, with payments for Bill Clinton, with the fake Russian dossier.
[00:38:36.579 --> 00:38:45.644]  You've got egg all over your face, and you're pointing at everyone else and saying, haha, look at the egg on your face, when you know damn well it's all over your own.
[00:38:45.644 --> 00:38:56.870]  And so here's Rod Rosenstein, in a fake victory for the Deep State, saying we're indicting these 12 Russians that they already indicted, who already showed up in court, and who Mueller balked at.
[00:38:57.776 --> 00:39:01.479]  Let's go back to Rosenstein.
[00:39:01.479 --> 00:39:08.184]  The Internet allows foreign adversaries to attack America in new and unexpected ways.
[00:39:08.184 --> 00:39:13.188]  Free and fair elections are always hard fought and contentious.
[00:39:13.188 --> 00:39:18.112]  There will always be adversaries who seek to exacerbate our divisions.
[00:39:18.112 --> 00:39:18.772]  Like the Democrats.
[00:39:18.772 --> 00:39:21.174]  Try to confuse, divide, and conquer us.
[00:39:21.174 --> 00:39:22.235]  Democrats.
[00:39:22.235 --> 00:39:23.576]  So long as we are united,
[00:39:25.293 --> 00:39:33.778]  In our commitment to the values enshrined in the Constitution, they will not succeed.
[00:39:33.778 --> 00:39:37.160]  A partisan warfare- This is, pause it right there!
[00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:41.203]  See, I'm telling you.
[00:39:41.203 --> 00:39:44.805]  Oh man, I'll tell you.
[00:39:44.805 --> 00:39:49.228]  I have faith in the American people that they're going to see through this.
[00:39:51.940 --> 00:40:02.231]  This SOB is sitting here saying that Russia is trying to sow discord and contentiousness in this country.
[00:40:02.231 --> 00:40:11.000]  As it's his own fake investigation, his own fake press conference, he and Mueller's fake indictments that are doing just that.
[00:40:13.737 --> 00:40:23.219]  The unmitigated nerve of these people tells you they have some serious business that they're trying to divert from.
[00:40:23.219 --> 00:40:26.100]  Let's go back to The Goblin.
[00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:36.303]  Modern technology does not fairly reflect the grace, dignity, and unity of the American people.
[00:40:36.303 --> 00:40:41.364]  The blame for election interference belongs to the criminals who committed election interference.
[00:40:42.861 --> 00:40:47.046]  We need to work together to hold the perpetrators accountable.
[00:40:47.046 --> 00:40:56.817]  And we need to keep moving forward to preserve our values, protect against future interference, and defend America.
[00:40:56.817 --> 00:40:57.978]  I have time to take a few questions.
[00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:03.531]  This is such BS.
[00:41:03.531 --> 00:41:04.051]  This is such BS.
[00:41:04.051 --> 00:41:06.273]  You're trying to sabotage the Trump-Putin summit, you little weasel!
[00:41:06.273 --> 00:41:06.433]  Fine.
[00:41:06.433 --> 00:41:07.034]  You know what?
[00:41:29.850 --> 00:41:35.532]  Bring him down, bring him down.
[00:41:35.532 --> 00:41:49.957]  So are they now saying, folks, this is breaking right now, and I'm sitting here in the studio, I haven't been able to hear the whole press conference, and I've only got one news story, guys, so if somebody wants to print me other news stories so I can read up on this, but I'm trying to figure this out.
[00:41:49.957 --> 00:41:50.977]  Are they now claiming
[00:41:53.123 --> 00:42:01.586]  So I know that they're claiming that these Russians have hacked the DNC, the DCCC, and the Hillary campaign.
[00:42:01.586 --> 00:42:11.910]  Okay, well they've always been claiming that, so there's nothing really new there, but are they now saying that the Russians actually hacked into the electronic voting machines and rigged the election?
[00:42:11.910 --> 00:42:16.051]  Are they now saying that?
[00:42:16.051 --> 00:42:19.672]  I mean, the headline on Drudge is implying that.
[00:42:19.672 --> 00:42:21.253]  I haven't heard Rosenstein say that
[00:42:22.930 --> 00:42:30.178]  I mean, just say it frankly, but he seems to be tiptoeing around it too.
[00:42:30.178 --> 00:42:32.260]  Okay.
[00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:37.065]  Are they now going to say the election was illegitimate because Russia hacked it?
[00:42:37.065 --> 00:42:43.592]  Are they now going to go full bore with that fake news?
[00:42:43.592 --> 00:42:44.933]  All right, well, if they do,
[00:42:46.745 --> 00:42:49.409]  Let's have a joint campaign for paper ballots again.
[00:42:49.409 --> 00:42:52.793]  I don't trust the electronic voting machine, so let's just have paper ballots.
[00:42:52.793 --> 00:42:55.757]  If you're going to claim Russia's hacking everything, let's go to paper ballots.
[00:42:55.757 --> 00:42:56.638]  Oh, but they won't do that.
[00:42:59.577 --> 00:43:06.704]  Nourish a probiotic-friendly environment in your gut with Prebiotic Fiber by InfoWars Life.

[00:47:19.293 --> 00:47:26.416]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:26.416 --> 00:47:31.339]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:47:31.339 --> 00:47:34.060]  Alright, it's clearing up to me now.
[00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:37.241]  We're all racing around here trying to figure out what the hell's going on.
[00:47:37.241 --> 00:47:40.463]  I want to correct something I said in the last segment.
[00:47:40.463 --> 00:47:42.904]  It is not the same Russians.
[00:47:42.904 --> 00:47:44.765]  It is not the same Russians.
[00:47:44.765 --> 00:47:47.046]  This is a new group of Russians.
[00:47:50.973 --> 00:47:56.475]  The news is so crazy.
[00:47:56.475 --> 00:48:06.678]  Story is still the same because the original indictments that I have right here that were filed in the District of Columbia.
[00:48:06.678 --> 00:48:09.759]  I don't see a date on this.
[00:48:09.759 --> 00:48:10.460]  Okay, yeah, there it is.
[00:48:10.460 --> 00:48:11.600]  Filed in February.
[00:48:12.677 --> 00:48:29.264]  So this is the original Mueller-Russia indictment that they celebrated that was filed in February, and these Russians, the quote-unquote troll farms, these Russians were indicted by Mueller, showed up in court, demanded discovery.
[00:48:29.264 --> 00:48:34.446]  Mueller balked, walked away, and you never heard anything more from this case at all.
[00:48:34.446 --> 00:48:34.626]  Okay.
[00:48:37.062 --> 00:48:42.585]  Now again, I inaccurately reported in the last segment that it was the same 12 Russians in the new indictments.
[00:48:42.585 --> 00:48:43.665]  That is not true.
[00:48:43.665 --> 00:48:48.227]  I now have the indictment in front of me and it is 12 totally different Russians.
[00:48:48.227 --> 00:48:55.330]  Now, briefing through this in the break is pretty much exactly what you would expect.
[00:48:55.330 --> 00:49:01.493]  They're claiming that the Russian military with these 12 people engaged in hacking U.S.
[00:49:01.493 --> 00:49:03.734]  elections, hacking the Democrats.
[00:49:06.513 --> 00:49:15.065]  They don't mention anything to my knowledge in going through this briefly about any hacking of Republicans or attempted hacking of Republicans.
[00:49:15.065 --> 00:49:19.071]  So I'm not sure if that's because none of that happened or if they were unable to do so.
[00:49:20.762 --> 00:49:38.868]  But they're saying they hacked the DNC, the DCCC, the Hillary campaign, and working with WikiLeaks, DCLeaks, and Guccifer 2.0, they staged the release of said documents to the public to, quote, interfere in the United States elections.
[00:49:38.868 --> 00:49:46.210]  Now, let's say, let's say that that is accurate information.
[00:49:47.233 --> 00:49:53.716]  Let's take this report for what it is and say that's accurate information.
[00:49:53.716 --> 00:49:58.558]  Well, I would say thank you, Russia.
[00:49:58.558 --> 00:50:01.139]  How about you?
[00:50:01.139 --> 00:50:13.585]  Why would the documents have affected the election so much unless it exposed corruption from inside the Democrat Party and the Hillary Clinton campaign?
[00:50:13.585 --> 00:50:14.205]  Which it did!
[00:50:16.909 --> 00:50:27.936]  Now whether you believe these indictments are real or not and these people were behind the hacking, it doesn't matter.
[00:50:27.936 --> 00:50:36.220]  Because the documents got out, we read them, we saw the emails, we know who Hillary is, we know who the Democrats are.
[00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:38.502]  That doesn't change.
[00:50:38.502 --> 00:50:43.305]  But they think they can divert the attention off of all of their corruption
[00:50:44.690 --> 00:50:58.198]  By crying, Russian collusion, Trump's Russian, Trump never won the presidency, even though they are the ones that tried to rig the election, they are the ones that did rig the primary, and it's, I mean, it's a joke!
[00:50:58.198 --> 00:51:01.220]  I mean, this is insane!
[00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:08.344]  President Trump goes from city to city and gets tens of thousands of people to come out to hear him speak.
[00:51:08.344 --> 00:51:13.147]  That is the President of the United States!
[00:51:13.147 --> 00:51:14.188]  There is no one else!
[00:51:15.520 --> 00:51:19.581]  There is no Russians organizing tens of thousands of people to see Donald Trump.
[00:51:19.581 --> 00:51:21.342]  That's Donald frickin' Trump!
[00:51:21.342 --> 00:51:22.062]  That's the U.S.
[00:51:22.062 --> 00:51:24.003]  of A!
[00:51:24.003 --> 00:51:29.125]  And you think you can distract us with some Russian collusion bullcrap?
[00:51:29.125 --> 00:51:33.726]  You're gonna tell us that the second American revolution is some Russian front?
[00:51:33.726 --> 00:51:35.547]  Bogus!
[00:51:35.547 --> 00:51:35.947]  Bull!
[00:51:36.974 --> 00:51:39.135]  This is America standing up to you!
[00:51:39.135 --> 00:51:48.437]  And I don't care if it was Russia that hacked him, if it was Seth Rich that hacked him, if it was Goosever that hacked him, if it was someone sitting in their couch, 300-pound hacker.
[00:51:48.437 --> 00:51:49.898]  I don't care who it was!
[00:51:49.898 --> 00:51:51.138]  We got them!
[00:51:51.138 --> 00:51:52.419]  We caught all of you!
[00:51:52.419 --> 00:51:53.739]  We caught Peter Stroke!
[00:51:53.739 --> 00:51:55.300]  We caught Rod Rosenstein!
[00:51:55.300 --> 00:51:56.620]  We caught the Democrats!
[00:51:56.620 --> 00:52:00.701]  We're not going to be distracted by your stupid, frickin' indictments!
[00:52:05.029 --> 00:52:11.772]  Let's review some of these headlines here.
[00:52:11.772 --> 00:52:12.853]  This is NBC.
[00:52:12.853 --> 00:52:13.733]  I don't know the date.
[00:52:13.733 --> 00:52:15.474]  This is older news, though.
[00:52:15.474 --> 00:52:16.935]  Russians penetrated U.S.
[00:52:16.935 --> 00:52:18.756]  voter systems, top U.S.
[00:52:18.756 --> 00:52:20.777]  official says.
[00:52:20.777 --> 00:52:23.839]  Another one.
[00:52:23.839 --> 00:52:28.661]  Indiana joins Idaho, claiming DHS tried to hack their election systems.
[00:52:28.661 --> 00:52:29.161]  Another one.
[00:52:29.161 --> 00:52:31.082]  Again, these are all old stories.
[00:52:31.082 --> 00:52:33.964]  Homeland Security tried to attempt hack of Georgia's election database.
[00:52:35.882 --> 00:52:52.813]  So you had a series of those, but then you had DHS come out and say, no, we have no intelligence that anybody hacked these systems or compromised these states voting systems.
[00:52:52.813 --> 00:52:56.495]  And now they're tiptoeing around that narrative.
[00:52:56.495 --> 00:52:59.737]  As far as I can see, they're not committing to it, but they want you to think that's what happened.
[00:53:04.662 --> 00:53:05.603]  Show me the red wave.
[00:53:05.603 --> 00:53:06.884]  Put the red wave full screen.
[00:53:06.884 --> 00:53:07.985]  Give me the red wave full screen.
[00:53:07.985 --> 00:53:08.385]  Give it.
[00:53:08.385 --> 00:53:10.427]  Give me full screen.
[00:53:10.427 --> 00:53:10.847]  No, no, no.
[00:53:10.847 --> 00:53:13.269]  I want just the red wave.
[00:53:13.269 --> 00:53:18.693]  This is what you get, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:53:18.693 --> 00:53:20.574]  This is the future of America.
[00:53:20.574 --> 00:53:24.437]  We are standing up together.
[00:53:24.437 --> 00:53:27.480]  The Democrat Party is dead.
[00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:31.143]  The left has gone totally insane.
[00:53:31.143 --> 00:53:32.404]  The red wave is coming.
[00:53:33.379 --> 00:53:40.804]  And so, on the eve of Trump meeting with Putin, they come out with this fake indictment over these Russians, with this fake narrative.
[00:53:40.804 --> 00:53:54.234]  On the eve of the United States of America coming back, breaking the shackles, they tell you it's all a Russian collusion story, nothing to see here.
[00:53:54.234 --> 00:53:54.814]  Guess what?
[00:53:54.814 --> 00:53:55.815]  We're not buying it.
[00:53:57.782 --> 00:54:01.604]  And on the eve of the midterm elections, what do they do?
[00:54:01.604 --> 00:54:14.791]  They make sure that they have their people own all of the proprietary software that gets installed on the electronic voting machines so that they can rig the final outcome.
[00:54:15.831 --> 00:54:27.278]  But watch what happens next when they go totally insane and claim the Russians are hacking the electronic voting machines and then we have to go back to paper ballots.
[00:54:27.278 --> 00:54:28.698]  They don't want that.
[00:54:28.698 --> 00:54:37.343]  If you had a paper ballot election, Donald Trump would win $80 million to, I don't know, $20 million.
[00:54:37.343 --> 00:54:39.965]  Wouldn't even be close.
[00:54:39.965 --> 00:54:41.206]  And they know it!
[00:54:41.206 --> 00:54:42.486]  And they've cornered themselves!
[00:54:42.486 --> 00:54:43.287]  Alright.
[00:54:44.474 --> 00:54:48.276]  Let's go back to Rod Rosenstein here to conclude this segment.
[00:54:48.276 --> 00:54:52.938]  The goblin creature foisting fake news upon us today.
[00:54:52.938 --> 00:55:07.926]  The evidence that reflects is reflected in our indictments and in our charges represents a determination by prosecutors and agents without regard to politics that we believe the evidence is sufficient to justify the charges.
[00:55:09.227 --> 00:55:18.674]  Yes, Deputy Attorney General, I know you've talked about the fact that, in your view, the evidence doesn't show any votes were changed as a result of this hacking.
[00:55:18.674 --> 00:55:28.142]  But you did say that a company used as a pass-through coordinated with these defendants to enhance the timing of the release and the impact on the election.
[00:55:28.142 --> 00:55:31.705]  Can you talk a little bit about what the evidence you have shows in that respect?
[00:55:32.085 --> 00:55:36.370]  So what I've talked about today is what is alleged in the indictment.
[00:55:36.370 --> 00:55:36.850]  Alleged.
[00:55:36.850 --> 00:55:43.016]  We know that according to the allegations in the indictment, the goal of the... Allegations.
[00:55:43.016 --> 00:55:46.640]  What impact they may have had or what their motivation... You have nothing.
[00:55:48.462 --> 00:55:49.963]  You have nothing, you little twit.
[00:55:49.963 --> 00:55:50.944]  It's a matter of speculation.
[00:55:50.944 --> 00:55:52.205]  That's not our responsibility.
[00:55:52.205 --> 00:55:56.029]  What I said is there's no allegation in the indictment about it.
[00:55:56.029 --> 00:55:58.751]  And that's not- We're shaking these losers off our back.
[00:55:58.751 --> 00:56:02.414]  In terms of the state election information, you said about 500,000 voters.
[00:56:02.414 --> 00:56:03.495]  Information was collected.
[00:56:03.495 --> 00:56:07.399]  Is there any evidence that what the Russians did with that information?
[00:56:07.399 --> 00:56:11.182]  And is there any evidence of other states being successfully penetrated by the Russians?
[00:56:11.682 --> 00:56:17.965]  I think that it's important for you to understand what I've told you are the allegations that are included in the indictment.
[00:56:17.965 --> 00:56:32.511]  The FBI and other intelligence community agencies... Now, if there was a real journalist in this media scrum right here, they'd say, um, uh, um, um, Nitwit Rosenstein, do you plan on launching any investigations upon the damning...
[00:56:33.131 --> 00:56:33.851]  We're good to go.
[00:56:47.022 --> 00:56:47.662]  Let's go to paper ballots!
[00:57:06.744 --> 00:57:07.845]  See, but this is what they're going to do.
[00:57:07.845 --> 00:57:09.207]  We're going to break now.
[00:57:09.207 --> 00:57:10.328]  You can take them out.
[00:57:10.328 --> 00:57:11.870]  This is what they're going to do then.
[00:57:11.870 --> 00:57:16.074]  Now they're going to try to say that DHS has to run all elections.
[00:57:16.074 --> 00:57:20.119]  The states and local governments don't get to even monitor them at all.
[00:57:20.119 --> 00:57:21.860]  They're going to give it all over to the federal government.
[00:57:21.860 --> 00:57:23.002]  That's what he just said.
[00:57:23.002 --> 00:57:25.244]  This is how they're going to rig the next election.
[00:57:25.244 --> 00:57:27.747]  You're going to get beat, man!
[00:57:27.747 --> 00:57:28.528]  You keep fighting!
[00:57:29.758 --> 00:57:33.063]  You keep digging yourself a hole deeper and deeper, don't you?
[00:57:33.063 --> 00:57:34.605]  You just can't give up.
[00:57:34.605 --> 00:57:36.087]  You just can't let go.
[00:57:36.087 --> 00:57:38.250]  You just had to drown this country, didn't you?
[00:57:38.250 --> 00:57:40.513]  You just had to choke us to death, didn't you?
[00:57:40.513 --> 00:57:44.859]  And now that we're breathing and swinging back, you still think you have us in your clutches?
[00:57:44.859 --> 00:57:45.620]  You don't!
[00:57:45.620 --> 00:57:46.100]  We're free!
[00:57:49.554 --> 00:57:51.515]  This 4th of July is special.
[00:57:51.515 --> 00:57:53.495]  Everybody can see it, they can feel it.
[00:57:53.495 --> 00:57:57.936]  The globalists are attempting to kill a worldwide awakening to their tyranny.
[00:57:57.936 --> 00:58:02.297]  And America, yet again, is at the heart of the resistance of the globalists.
[00:58:02.297 --> 00:58:07.419]  That's why this 4th of July I'm asking all of our great supporters to think about Infowars now more than ever.
[00:58:07.419 --> 00:58:11.140]  And what would the world be like if Infowars wasn't there resisting the globalists?
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:14.302]  What would have happened if you hadn't supported InfoWars?
[00:58:14.302 --> 00:58:16.244]  We would not be having the victories we have today.
[00:58:16.244 --> 00:58:19.407]  So yes, a lot of good things are happening, but the enemy is striking back.
[00:58:19.407 --> 00:58:26.554]  So please, think about InfoWars and funding our operation while you get great products at the same time on the 4th of July that's so historic.
[00:58:26.554 --> 00:58:28.415]  We have record sales going on right now.
[00:58:29.309 --> 00:58:34.572]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from InfoWars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[00:58:34.572 --> 00:58:35.312]  It's you!
[00:58:59.727 --> 00:59:02.230]  That's why you've been on the team supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[00:59:02.230 --> 00:59:03.672]  You are the InfoWarrant.
[00:59:03.672 --> 00:59:06.475]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[00:59:20.871 --> 00:59:32.256]  That everyone go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[00:59:32.256 --> 00:59:40.240]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the InfoWars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:47.284]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[00:59:47.284 --> 00:59:50.025]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning!
[00:59:53.320 --> 00:59:55.922]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:24.019 --> 01:00:31.262]  This is confusing to me because the DCCC and the DNC refused to turn their servers over.
[01:00:31.262 --> 01:00:39.025]  So how does Rod Rosenstein and Robert Mueller know that when they didn't cooperate with the investigation and refused to turn their servers over?
[01:00:39.025 --> 01:00:42.766]  Boy, that is an amazing assumption to make!
[01:00:42.766 --> 01:00:45.207]  Wonder how they reached that conclusion.
[01:00:45.207 --> 01:00:46.687]  Of course, they didn't conclude that.
[01:00:46.687 --> 01:00:47.828]  They're just alleging that.
[01:00:48.922 --> 01:00:51.784]  Like Paul Manafort being in jail for alleged attempting.
[01:00:51.784 --> 01:00:53.205]  I don't care what you put behind that.
[01:00:53.205 --> 01:00:56.728]  You can't lock someone up for alleged attempting.
[01:00:56.728 --> 01:00:58.829]  This is America.
[01:00:58.829 --> 01:01:08.276]  So, I'm now joined by Larry Klayman, the founder of Judicial Watch and Freedom Watch, where you can see his work at freedomwatchusa.org.
[01:01:08.276 --> 01:01:09.817]  Short segment here.
[01:01:09.817 --> 01:01:12.539]  Larry will be with us for two more segments on the other side.
[01:01:12.539 --> 01:01:15.461]  But, I mean, Larry, this is pretty incredible stuff.
[01:01:16.656 --> 01:01:28.122]  Considering everything we've seen from the fake Russian collusion probe, for them to now reach this point right before Trump meets with Putin, what does it tell you?
[01:01:28.122 --> 01:01:29.963]  Does it tell you how desperate they are?
[01:01:29.963 --> 01:01:35.446]  Or do you really believe that the Russians are responsible for all this hacking?
[01:01:35.446 --> 01:01:37.167]  Owen, you raise an excellent point.
[01:01:37.167 --> 01:01:40.569]  How do they know this if they don't have access to the DNC servers?
[01:01:40.569 --> 01:01:40.949]  And of course,
[01:01:41.624 --> 01:01:51.753]  They don't have access, the FBI and Mueller, because what's on those DNC servers will be extremely incriminating for the Democratic National Committee, Hillary Clinton and others.
[01:01:51.753 --> 01:01:53.915]  But yeah, this is political hackery.
[01:01:53.915 --> 01:01:56.257]  This is exactly what we've seen with Robert Mueller.
[01:01:56.257 --> 01:01:57.838]  It's more than a witch hunt.
[01:01:57.838 --> 01:02:05.404]  They're trying to impede or trying to destroy this summit with Vladimir Putin, which is coming up in just a day or so.
[01:02:05.404 --> 01:02:07.326]  And it's quite obvious why this was done now.
[01:02:07.326 --> 01:02:08.327]  And the fact that you have
[01:02:09.608 --> 01:02:11.289]  Yeah, and what does it tell you?
[01:02:35.137 --> 01:02:40.160]  That Rod Rosenstein is out here making the statement and Sessions is nowhere to be found.
[01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:47.325]  I mean, it's almost like they're pushing Rosenstein on us just to rub it in our face.
[01:02:47.325 --> 01:02:47.846]  Absolutely.
[01:02:47.846 --> 01:02:55.051]  Well, you know, he's on a jihad, Rosenstein, literally, because he's been stung by certain people in Capitol Hill that asked him tough questions.
[01:02:55.051 --> 01:02:58.293]  Of course, nothing happens on Capitol Hill, but he doesn't like the questions anyway.
[01:02:59.093 --> 01:03:03.317]  And he doesn't like the president criticizing him directly and indirectly.
[01:03:03.317 --> 01:03:09.762]  And he's probably on orders from Sessions who, you know, the president would like to see gone to do a number on Trump.
[01:03:09.762 --> 01:03:13.926]  At this point, it's warfare between the president and the Justice Department.
[01:03:13.926 --> 01:03:17.509]  It's warfare between the American people and the Justice Department.
[01:03:17.509 --> 01:03:20.171]  And Owen, I'm an alumnus of the Justice Department.
[01:03:20.171 --> 01:03:23.034]  I'm absolutely disgusted at this whole thing.
[01:03:23.034 --> 01:03:26.657]  And that's why we're actually going to be doing our own grand juries for the American people.
[01:03:27.435 --> 01:03:31.699]  In Dallas and other places, because we need to take justice into our own hands.
[01:03:31.699 --> 01:03:33.840]  We don't have a justice system anymore.
[01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:42.668]  We'll do it peacefully and legally, but we have the right to impanel, to indict, to try, to convict, sentence, and even do citizens arrest peacefully and legally.
[01:03:42.668 --> 01:03:50.074]  The Clintons, Comey, Mueller, Intelligence Agency, Senator Obama, and Obama himself are our prime target.
[01:03:50.074 --> 01:03:53.477]  So this is a Justice Department, which is spinning wildly out of control.
[01:03:54.275 --> 01:03:58.966]  Which does not represent the interests of either President Trump or the American people.
[01:03:58.966 --> 01:04:02.735]  And Rod Rosenstein is the poster boy of the corruption over there.
[01:04:03.462 --> 01:04:13.508]  I want to talk more about that on the other side, because I mean, that's just an incredible move that you're making over there at FreedomWatchUSA.org, and I'd like to talk about that.
[01:04:13.508 --> 01:04:26.516]  But you know, isn't it funny, Larry, when you founded Judicial Watch, what was it, just over 20 years ago, part of the original investigations were into Hillary Clinton and illegally having classified documents.
[01:04:26.516 --> 01:04:29.418]  Isn't it funny that still to this day you're investigating the same damn thing?
[01:04:30.422 --> 01:04:31.783]  Absolutely.
[01:04:31.783 --> 01:04:34.585]  And we're not just investigating, we're bringing cases.
[01:04:34.585 --> 01:04:50.778]  I mean, I have a lawsuit going up to the Supreme Court for Hillary's wrongful death actions, which killed two of our clients' sons, Ty Woods and Sean Smith at Benghazi, because her server was hacked and the terrorists found the coordinates of Ambassador Chris Stevens and killed everybody.
[01:04:50.778 --> 01:04:52.179]  So we bring hard-hitting cases.
[01:04:52.179 --> 01:04:53.781]  I'm tired, Owen, and this is why I like you.
[01:04:53.781 --> 01:04:55.642]  And the people are tired, I'm tired with you.
[01:04:55.642 --> 01:04:56.543]  And we'll be right back with more.
[01:04:58.220 --> 01:05:18.195]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[01:05:18.195 --> 01:05:20.316]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[01:05:20.316 --> 01:05:24.319]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:05:24.319 --> 01:05:25.360]  I want to thank everybody that has.
[01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:31.564]  We've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[01:05:31.564 --> 01:05:33.946]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[01:05:33.946 --> 01:05:36.587]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[01:05:36.587 --> 01:05:37.528]  That's my dad.
[01:05:37.528 --> 01:05:39.389]  The colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[01:05:39.389 --> 01:05:41.871]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:05:41.871 --> 01:05:51.077]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[01:05:51.077 --> 01:05:55.520]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[01:05:59.423 --> 01:06:05.128]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:05.128 --> 01:06:10.633]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:06:10.633 --> 01:06:13.976]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:06:13.976 --> 01:06:15.678]  Larry Klayman has been doing great work.
[01:06:16.869 --> 01:06:22.373]  He founded Judicial Watch and is now running FreedomWatchUSA.org.
[01:06:22.373 --> 01:06:27.558]  Larry, I was unaware of this campaign that you talked about in the last segment.
[01:06:27.558 --> 01:06:31.261]  I'm not sure how much you've talked about this, but I'd really like to hear more about this.
[01:06:31.261 --> 01:06:42.730]  What is it exactly that you are planning on doing with FreedomWatchUSA.org to bring justice to high treasonous criminals like Clinton and Obama that we don't get from the Justice Department?
[01:06:44.505 --> 01:06:46.607]  Thank you, Alan, for raising that.
[01:06:46.607 --> 01:06:51.391]  I'm tired of watching TV, not InfoWars, because you guys tell it like it is.
[01:06:51.391 --> 01:06:53.293]  And that's why I love being on here.
[01:06:53.293 --> 01:06:55.915]  But offering this false hope that something's going to happen.
[01:06:56.508 --> 01:06:58.810]  We just saw the hearings on Capitol Hill yesterday.
[01:06:58.810 --> 01:07:02.894]  Yes, it exposed who Peter Strzok is, but Congress isn't going to do anything.
[01:07:02.894 --> 01:07:08.300]  Our Justice Department is just doing stuff which is negative, which actually harms the President and the country.
[01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:12.704]  And, of course, other branches of government have been inert, too.
[01:07:12.704 --> 01:07:14.886]  So we need to take matters into our own hands.
[01:07:14.886 --> 01:07:20.972]  And Justice Antonin Scalia, in 1992, in a case styled the United States versus Williams,
[01:07:21.943 --> 01:07:25.286]  Said that the grand jury doesn't belong to the three branches of government.
[01:07:25.286 --> 01:07:27.527]  It belongs to the American people.
[01:07:27.527 --> 01:07:32.231]  Now, up to July 1st of 1870, we didn't even have a Justice Department.
[01:07:32.231 --> 01:07:35.454]  So the American people needed to meet out justice.
[01:07:35.454 --> 01:07:38.476]  And we have the right to do that under our Constitution.
[01:07:38.476 --> 01:07:46.182]  So what I'm proposing to do in Dallas, Philadelphia and other cities around the country is to impanel grand juries from neutral voter rolls
[01:07:46.986 --> 01:07:48.607]  To put forward evidence.
[01:07:48.607 --> 01:07:49.447]  We've got enough evidence.
[01:07:49.447 --> 01:08:02.252]  We don't need any more information here to indict the Clintons, to indict Mueller, to indict Comey, to invite John Brennan, former head of the CIA, James Clapper, former head of the Director of National Intelligence, and Obama himself.
[01:08:02.252 --> 01:08:03.533]  We've got enough.
[01:08:03.533 --> 01:08:09.955]  And then we will try these individuals in front of either a retired judge or someone who's neutral.
[01:08:09.955 --> 01:08:11.416]  We will obtain convictions.
[01:08:11.416 --> 01:08:13.477]  I'm convinced the evidence is overwhelming.
[01:08:14.156 --> 01:08:20.580]  We will then sentence these individuals and we'll seek to arrest them peacefully and legally.
[01:08:20.580 --> 01:08:21.020]  What else?
[01:08:21.020 --> 01:08:22.260]  What other choice do we have?
[01:08:22.260 --> 01:08:25.602]  Our country does not have a justice system.
[01:08:25.602 --> 01:08:34.827]  We have an attorney general and a deputy attorney general who are absent on the job and are actually working against the American people and trying to destroy the president himself.
[01:08:34.827 --> 01:08:37.869]  The president, who I think is doing a fantastic job.
[01:08:37.869 --> 01:08:41.851]  And this, of course, get back to what Rosenberg Rosenberg, that's a Freudian slip.
[01:08:42.489 --> 01:08:48.595]  Rosenstein did just today is that he's trying to derail the Putin-Trump summit.
[01:08:48.595 --> 01:08:50.256]  He's trying to embarrass the president.
[01:08:50.256 --> 01:08:52.418]  He's trying to humiliate the president.
[01:08:52.418 --> 01:08:53.099]  So is Mueller.
[01:08:53.099 --> 01:08:54.060]  They're working together.
[01:08:54.060 --> 01:08:55.421]  These people need to be removed.
[01:08:55.421 --> 01:09:00.005]  Now, I also have, Owen, on our website at freedomwatchusa.org, a petition.
[01:09:00.005 --> 01:09:04.329]  We have 25,000 plus names right now to have me named special counsel.
[01:09:04.329 --> 01:09:08.893]  So in addition to the Citizens Grand Juries, if I was special counsel, the second one,
[01:09:09.753 --> 01:09:19.417]  All these people, I would have the powers of the Justice Department without actually having to take orders from them, and I would indict them, convict them, and have them tried and sentenced as well.
[01:09:19.417 --> 01:09:28.020]  So, there aren't many people in this country, in fact, I don't know of anyone, if I can maybe toot my own horn a little bit here, who will stick their neck out to this degree.
[01:09:28.655 --> 01:09:31.316]  You know, Alex will, you will, others will do it.
[01:09:31.316 --> 01:09:36.239]  In the media side, I have to do it in the justice system, and not even my former group does that.
[01:09:36.239 --> 01:09:39.120]  They get documents, but it's not run by a lawyer.
[01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:43.302]  I'm a lawyer of 40 years experience as a trial lawyer, as a prosecutor.
[01:09:43.302 --> 01:09:44.342]  I'll get the job done.
[01:09:44.342 --> 01:09:45.283]  I'll bring about justice.
[01:09:45.762 --> 01:09:52.646]  Well, and imagine, I mean, you look at the total rogue state of the Mueller probe right now.
[01:09:52.646 --> 01:10:04.292]  Imagine if Larry Klayman had a staff and the same rogue investigatory tactics of Mueller to investigate Mueller, or investigate Pelosi and Waters.
[01:10:04.292 --> 01:10:06.413]  I mean, it'd be game over for these people.
[01:10:06.413 --> 01:10:08.615]  And everybody knows that's the case.
[01:10:08.615 --> 01:10:11.356]  Of course that's the case, you know.
[01:10:11.356 --> 01:10:12.577]  But what can people do
[01:10:13.197 --> 01:10:17.540]  To help you spearhead this movement and to help move it forward?
[01:10:17.540 --> 01:10:18.701]  Well, we need the resources.
[01:10:18.701 --> 01:10:20.102]  We're small right now.
[01:10:20.102 --> 01:10:21.843]  We're the mouse that roared.
[01:10:21.843 --> 01:10:23.725]  We're powerful, but we need to get bigger.
[01:10:23.725 --> 01:10:29.809]  These citizens' grand juries are going to be expensive, and a lot of logistics, a lot of individuals involved.
[01:10:29.809 --> 01:10:33.592]  So go to our website at freedomwatchusa.org.
[01:10:33.592 --> 01:10:36.194]  Don't just sign the petition to have me name special counsel.
[01:10:36.194 --> 01:10:39.577]  We need 100,000 signatures to get the President's attention.
[01:10:39.577 --> 01:10:42.479]  He's so preoccupied right now with serious crises.
[01:10:43.149 --> 01:10:44.850]  But also donate to our cause.
[01:10:44.850 --> 01:10:47.933]  Join our Freedom Watch's Justice League.
[01:10:47.933 --> 01:10:58.860]  I just started this because this movie, for instance, which I saw a couple times on the plane going back to Washington in the last few weeks, really tells you that the American people can do it.
[01:10:58.860 --> 01:11:00.141]  We are the superheroes.
[01:11:00.141 --> 01:11:01.723]  We don't have to depend on government.
[01:11:01.723 --> 01:11:02.303]  No, that's right.
[01:11:02.303 --> 01:11:06.726]  You know, the superheroes of Justice League didn't look to the Justice Department to do it.
[01:11:06.726 --> 01:11:07.707]  They did it for themselves.
[01:11:08.303 --> 01:11:09.444]  So it's a good analogy.
[01:11:09.444 --> 01:11:12.126]  So go to FreedomWatchUSA.org.
[01:11:12.126 --> 01:11:13.107]  Donate to our cause.
[01:11:13.107 --> 01:11:14.408]  It's tax deductible.
[01:11:14.408 --> 01:11:15.790]  Sign the petitions.
[01:11:15.790 --> 01:11:17.191]  Get our newsletters.
[01:11:17.191 --> 01:11:19.573]  Become part of our Citizens Army, our Justice League.
[01:11:20.177 --> 01:11:24.798]  And look, you know, this is hitting me more than ever right now, Larry.
[01:11:24.798 --> 01:11:26.479]  And I know that you've been there, obviously.
[01:11:26.479 --> 01:11:28.699]  I mean, you've been working Judicial Watch, Freedom Watch.
[01:11:28.699 --> 01:11:29.860]  You're now organizing this.
[01:11:29.860 --> 01:11:33.281]  I mean, it's time to get active.
[01:11:33.281 --> 01:11:34.841]  It's time to get engaged.
[01:11:34.841 --> 01:11:38.322]  We as Americans have a duty to protect this republic.
[01:11:38.322 --> 01:11:39.563]  It is under threat.
[01:11:39.563 --> 01:11:40.983]  It is under siege right now.
[01:11:41.303 --> 01:11:42.885]  Our government's totally corrupt.
[01:11:42.885 --> 01:11:43.966]  It's been corrupt.
[01:11:43.966 --> 01:11:45.187]  It's way too big.
[01:11:45.187 --> 01:11:49.631]  We've got these huge global institutions like NATO that do nothing for us.
[01:11:49.631 --> 01:11:51.292]  It's time to shut it all down.
[01:11:51.292 --> 01:11:52.713]  People need to get engaged and active.
[01:11:52.713 --> 01:11:53.554]  They need to understand.
[01:11:53.554 --> 01:11:57.338]  I'm not calling for a bunch of minion protests in the street.
[01:11:57.338 --> 01:11:58.979]  We're not calling for a bunch of craziness.
[01:11:58.979 --> 01:12:00.340]  We're not calling for violence.
[01:12:00.340 --> 01:12:02.002]  We're saying it's time for us to organize.
[01:12:02.222 --> 01:12:11.206]  It's time for everyone that listens to this show to go to freedomwatchusa.org, sign the petition, tell your friends and family, get engaged, get active.
[01:12:11.206 --> 01:12:12.627]  It's now or never, folks.
[01:12:12.627 --> 01:12:14.628]  We have the president in the White House.
[01:12:14.628 --> 01:12:21.150]  If we have his back, he has every mandate to do whatever is possible to save this republic.
[01:12:21.150 --> 01:12:22.311]  You're right, if he goes down,
[01:12:22.972 --> 01:12:27.734]  We're going to have a president a hundred times worse than Obama or Clinton, the next president.
[01:12:27.734 --> 01:12:29.534]  We can't let that happen.
[01:12:29.534 --> 01:12:37.357]  He is our hope in terms of the government, but the American people remain their own hope as the Justice League is their hope.
[01:12:37.357 --> 01:12:46.640]  And if you're tired of watching cable news, not InfoWars, but cable news and seeing this false hope being served up every night.
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:50.321]  You know, I watch Fox News too, but it gives me the impression something's happening.
[01:12:50.321 --> 01:12:51.102]  Nothing's happening.
[01:12:51.102 --> 01:12:52.142]  We know nothing's happening.
[01:12:52.648 --> 01:12:59.853]  We've been out there fighting the Clintons for 25 years since I started Judicial Watch and now I run Freedom Watch.
[01:12:59.853 --> 01:13:08.739]  I have a finding that Bill Clinton committed a crime when he released the Privacy Act protected files of a woman he harassed in the Oval Office, Kathleen Willey.
[01:13:08.739 --> 01:13:13.903]  But now's the time that we have to do it for ourselves and our founding fathers.
[01:13:13.903 --> 01:13:14.843]  They risked their lives.
[01:13:14.843 --> 01:13:18.446]  They pledged their fortunes and sacred honor to form a new nation.
[01:13:19.053 --> 01:13:21.414]  We can at least do citizens' grand juries.
[01:13:21.414 --> 01:13:23.015]  We have the legal right to do it.
[01:13:23.015 --> 01:13:25.737]  Justice Scalia said we have the right to do it.
[01:13:25.737 --> 01:13:27.177]  And we can even enforce it.
[01:13:27.177 --> 01:13:29.178]  And we're going to have to do citizens' arrests.
[01:13:29.178 --> 01:13:29.559]  I always say...
[01:13:35.646 --> 01:13:39.429]  Well, and even President Trump said we're going to give the government back to the people.
[01:13:39.429 --> 01:13:40.109]  You know what, guys?
[01:13:40.109 --> 01:13:43.472]  Let's let Larry get reconnected here and let's just reconnect with Larry.
[01:13:43.472 --> 01:13:44.513]  We're about to go to a break here.
[01:13:44.513 --> 01:13:46.154]  His Skype was breaking up.
[01:13:46.154 --> 01:13:50.938]  So we'll get Larry back connected here with a solid connection before we go to this break.
[01:13:50.938 --> 01:13:53.520]  But he's 100% spot on.
[01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:55.401]  Trump said we have to give the government back to the people.
[01:13:55.401 --> 01:13:57.403]  That is what Larry is talking about.
[01:13:58.363 --> 01:14:06.971]  And I don't know if he's got dates yet of when he's planning on being in Dallas, Philadelphia, but I want to help get this off the ground and even be present there.
[01:14:06.971 --> 01:14:12.676]  Before we get to this break, and we're rejoined by Larry Klayman on the other side, support InfoWars.

[01:15:28.657 --> 01:15:29.738]  People are waking up.
[01:15:29.738 --> 01:15:30.958]  They see what's going on.
[01:15:30.958 --> 01:15:33.539]  They don't know where to go to understand it and put it all together.
[01:15:33.539 --> 01:15:36.940]  Be like, hey, check out InfoWars.
[01:15:36.940 --> 01:15:38.441]  And check out our new app.

[01:17:58.208 --> 01:18:04.574]  The scientists at Infowars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.
[01:18:04.574 --> 01:18:07.797]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with Bades.

[01:18:58.453 --> 01:19:02.397]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[01:19:02.397 --> 01:19:05.700]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:11.967]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[01:19:11.967 --> 01:19:14.729]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[01:19:15.470 --> 01:19:19.294]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[01:19:19.294 --> 01:19:25.760]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:30.724]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[01:19:31.465 --> 01:19:35.408]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[01:19:35.408 --> 01:19:42.592]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[01:19:42.592 --> 01:19:47.295]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[01:19:47.295 --> 01:19:53.499]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[01:19:53.499 --> 01:19:57.482]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[01:20:01.301 --> 01:20:25.190]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:25.190 --> 01:20:28.471]  Well, Larry Klayman has dragon energy.
[01:20:29.975 --> 01:20:43.041]  And he is spearheading a movement to unite the citizens of America against individuals who have committed crimes of high treason against this country.
[01:20:43.041 --> 01:20:45.542]  Yes, you know who we're talking about.
[01:20:47.273 --> 01:20:57.516]  And as far as I can tell, I don't see anyone else pushing this and for an organization of this like Larry Klayman is doing with FreedomWatchUSA.org.
[01:20:57.516 --> 01:20:59.037]  Larry is still with me for another segment.
[01:20:59.037 --> 01:21:04.319]  Larry, you mentioned you are planning to have grand jury events in Dallas and Philadelphia.
[01:21:04.319 --> 01:21:07.540]  Do you have a date set for those yet?
[01:21:07.540 --> 01:21:12.141]  Yes, it's going to be in and about, as lawyers say, the 25th of September.
[01:21:12.141 --> 01:21:13.341]  We need time to ramp up.
[01:21:13.341 --> 01:21:15.022]  We need to get names off of voter rolls.
[01:21:15.791 --> 01:21:17.152]  You know, go to our website, sign up.
[01:21:17.152 --> 01:21:19.633]  We can use some volunteers here, too.
[01:21:19.633 --> 01:21:21.474]  And we need to be able to put this in place.
[01:21:21.474 --> 01:21:25.797]  But we're going to do it in a very, very professional, ethical and legal way.
[01:21:25.797 --> 01:21:27.498]  So it sticks.
[01:21:27.498 --> 01:21:29.319]  And it's going to be powerful when we do it.
[01:21:29.319 --> 01:21:30.540]  And we're going to set an example.
[01:21:30.540 --> 01:21:32.681]  And when we get those sentences, we're going to show up.
[01:21:33.340 --> 01:21:34.981]  In front of the houses of these people.
[01:21:34.981 --> 01:21:37.222]  Hillary Clinton in Calorama, Washington.
[01:21:37.222 --> 01:21:42.205]  Turn yourself in, Hillary, because we have a right to arrest you and put you where you belong.
[01:21:42.205 --> 01:21:50.589]  And we're going to ask for a judge to enforce these sentences, the result of our indictments and convictions with the citizens' grand juries.
[01:21:50.589 --> 01:21:52.770]  So even if we don't have a judge do it,
[01:21:53.470 --> 01:21:55.852]  We can do it on our own, peacefully and legally.
[01:21:55.852 --> 01:22:03.337]  So yes, in and around September 25th, keep posted on our website at freedomwatchusa.org.
[01:22:03.337 --> 01:22:05.898]  Sign up, donate, support our cause.
[01:22:05.898 --> 01:22:07.580]  This is really our only last hope.
[01:22:07.580 --> 01:22:15.385]  And Owen, you know, we all watch Fox News and we watch other networks and we see this false hope every night that something's going to happen.
[01:22:15.385 --> 01:22:19.988]  And I've been listening lately and I hear people saying, wasn't it great that we got more information out?
[01:22:20.729 --> 01:22:21.650]  No, it's not that great.
[01:22:21.650 --> 01:22:28.175]  We have enough information to indict and convict these criminals like Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton right now.
[01:22:28.175 --> 01:22:29.577]  We don't need any more information.
[01:22:29.577 --> 01:22:31.858]  What we need is action.
[01:22:31.858 --> 01:22:47.612]  You know, and this is something that's actually kind of been weighing on my mind lately, given just how absurd the news cycle has gotten, how insane the left has gotten, where, you know, for me, I'm sitting here reflecting upon what I do, saying,
[01:22:49.184 --> 01:22:57.995]  Is it the best investment of my time on the air to report all the fake news, to cover all the stuff we know that you're talking about?
[01:22:57.995 --> 01:22:59.918]  It's like, we already know this.
[01:22:59.918 --> 01:23:02.802]  It's like, sometimes I feel like I'm beating my head against a wall.
[01:23:02.802 --> 01:23:05.405]  And I think the solution is what you're doing.
[01:23:05.405 --> 01:23:07.247]  And I want to do more of this here at Infowars.
[01:23:08.715 --> 01:23:16.063]  I mean, yes, we need to cover the fake news to sort it all out because there's people out there that genuinely don't understand all of it.
[01:23:16.063 --> 01:23:17.705]  They're new to this and they want the truth.
[01:23:17.705 --> 01:23:18.626]  They want the answers.
[01:23:18.626 --> 01:23:22.371]  But at a different level, we have to organize.
[01:23:22.371 --> 01:23:24.093]  We have to now get active.
[01:23:24.093 --> 01:23:29.379]  We have to do things like start an independent grand jury of citizens like Larry Klayman is doing.
[01:23:29.699 --> 01:23:40.883]  We have to plan stunts like they do, where they go out and do a woman's march, you know, as if Trump is the first guy to ever say anything about, you know, a woman's private parts in the history of mankind.
[01:23:40.883 --> 01:23:43.624]  Give me a break, Bill Clinton was grabbing him his entire life.
[01:23:43.624 --> 01:23:50.626]  So, that to me is the next angle of Infowars, and I think that you're spearheading one movement.
[01:23:51.633 --> 01:23:57.860]  Let me know about when you're doing this in Dallas because, Larry, I want to be there and I want to be covering it for InfoWars.
[01:23:57.860 --> 01:24:10.412]  So just, once again, tell the audience where they can go to get information and help out your cause to start an independent grand jury of citizens to bring our own charges in a citizen's arrest against high treason and crime against this country.
[01:24:10.412 --> 01:24:12.154]  Well, thank you, Owen, for offering to do that.
[01:24:12.154 --> 01:24:14.717]  I'd like to have what we're doing in real time on InfoWars.
[01:24:15.553 --> 01:24:19.379]  And you can be part of it, and everybody needs to be part of it.
[01:24:19.379 --> 01:24:23.704]  But yes, they can go to FreedomWatchUSA.org.
[01:24:23.704 --> 01:24:27.049]  FreedomWatchUSA.org.
[01:24:27.049 --> 01:24:27.349]  That's org.
[01:24:28.323 --> 01:24:31.965]  And sign up because we are deadly serious about this.
[01:24:31.965 --> 01:24:34.186]  We are going to bring these citizens grand juries.
[01:24:34.186 --> 01:24:36.187]  We are going to be the People's Justice Department.
[01:24:36.187 --> 01:24:39.189]  We already are, but we're putting it into effect now.
[01:24:39.189 --> 01:24:54.638]  And I have 40 years of experience that I'm going to draw on to get the job done to turn this country back to the vision of our founding fathers and to bring about a equal system of justice where the elites, where the arrogant fat cat elites in Washington D.C.
[01:24:54.638 --> 01:24:56.919]  of both political parties walk off scot-free.
[01:24:59.870 --> 01:25:05.652]  Is there anything else you have up your sleeve right now, or is this pretty much your focus at Freedom Watch USA?
[01:25:05.652 --> 01:25:09.954]  Is this pretty much where you're investing all of your time and energy now?
[01:25:09.954 --> 01:25:12.114]  Most of it, but I do have other things up my sleeve.
[01:25:12.114 --> 01:25:16.736]  For instance, on September 4th, a judge in Washington, D.C.
[01:25:16.736 --> 01:25:28.480]  has ordered one of the few honest judges that was appointed by Bill Clinton, a guy named Emmett Sullivan, that Mueller's going to have to release all of his documentation, his emails of communications with the media.
[01:25:29.156 --> 01:25:32.538]  And I'm convinced that's going to show criminal grand jury leaks.
[01:25:32.538 --> 01:25:36.341]  We're going to use that to have him indicted with the citizens' grand juries.
[01:25:36.341 --> 01:25:50.390]  And we're also hopeful that once that comes out, President Trump will summon up the strength, because he's been getting bad advice from his lawyers, to finally fire Mueller and to fire Rosenstein and to fire Sessions and clean house at the Justice Department.
[01:25:50.390 --> 01:25:52.311]  So, yeah, we have a lot of things.
[01:25:52.311 --> 01:25:57.735]  Of course, we have our case going to the Supreme Court to hold Hillary Clinton accountable for the wrongful death.
[01:25:58.599 --> 01:26:13.750]  Of our Gold Star family's sons, Ty Woods and Sean Smith at Benghazi, because it was her use of a private email server, which was hacked, probably by the terrorists, which gave rise to the coordinates of the ambassador, which then allowed the terrorists to kill our client's sons.
[01:26:13.750 --> 01:26:15.471]  She has blood on her hands.
[01:26:15.471 --> 01:26:17.092]  So we're proceeding with that too.
[01:26:17.092 --> 01:26:17.872]  And many other things.
[01:26:17.872 --> 01:26:24.537]  You can see it at freedomwatchusa.org that we are constantly bringing hard-hitting cases.
[01:26:24.537 --> 01:26:25.858]  We're coming up with innovative
[01:26:26.505 --> 01:26:31.868]  But legal ideas like citizens, grand juries, we just don't get documents, the Freedom of Information Act.
[01:26:31.868 --> 01:26:33.089]  We actually take action.
[01:26:33.089 --> 01:26:35.450]  We are your Justice Department.
[01:26:35.450 --> 01:26:36.591]  The real one.
[01:26:36.591 --> 01:26:37.692]  And you know, I sit here...
[01:26:39.682 --> 01:26:43.584]  And I think about what you're saying, and it's just like, it's unbelievable.
[01:26:43.584 --> 01:26:46.065]  They're thinking about running Hillary again!
[01:26:46.065 --> 01:26:49.186]  I mean, this woman is halfway to hell.
[01:26:49.186 --> 01:26:56.509]  She's been caught red-handed breaking law after law after law, having a wide-open illegal private server with classified information.
[01:26:56.509 --> 01:27:00.791]  Anybody can come in, get information, get this information, kill U.S.
[01:27:00.791 --> 01:27:02.091]  soldiers, and then she gets away with it.
[01:27:04.734 --> 01:27:08.116]  Honestly, I just can't believe that we've reached this point.
[01:27:08.116 --> 01:27:12.619]  Now, final comments from Larry Kleiman here before we let you go.
[01:27:12.619 --> 01:27:17.763]  What do you think comes next as far as what Trump does with this Mueller investigation?
[01:27:17.763 --> 01:27:21.025]  Obviously, you've called for him being fired, but they're doubling down.
[01:27:21.025 --> 01:27:23.087]  They just did the press conference with Rosenstein today.
[01:27:23.087 --> 01:27:24.247]  They're indicting more Russians.
[01:27:24.247 --> 01:27:27.690]  They're claiming they're hacking and everything, so they're doubling, tripling, quadrupling down.
[01:27:27.690 --> 01:27:30.952]  Do you see that trend continuing, and what does Trump do to stop it?
[01:27:31.877 --> 01:27:37.007]  I see it continuing, and that's why I want to bring about the indictment of Robert Mueller.
[01:27:37.007 --> 01:27:38.349]  I want him convicted.
[01:27:38.349 --> 01:27:39.912]  I want him put away.
[01:27:39.912 --> 01:27:42.357]  Because he's on a jihad right now, literally.
[01:27:43.169 --> 01:27:45.890]  No, no less than a legal terrorist.
[01:27:45.890 --> 01:27:55.014]  And the fact that there was an indictment today of these Russians was to try to destroy and to embarrass and to humiliate him in his summit with Vladimir Putin.
[01:27:55.014 --> 01:27:57.255]  These people are evil to the core.
[01:27:57.255 --> 01:28:03.818]  They're literally disciples of the devil, if I might say analogously, and they need to be taken out legally.
[01:28:03.818 --> 01:28:04.578]  And the president
[01:28:05.484 --> 01:28:16.876]  You know, he's not getting good advice from his own in-house lawyers because he's just getting dragged along, gets worse and worse and worse, and now the American people are going to have to rise up in his defense and in defense of their own interests.
[01:28:18.109 --> 01:28:20.571]  I think that you have coined a new phrase here.
[01:28:20.571 --> 01:28:23.933]  I think Robert Mueller is a legal terrorist.
[01:28:23.933 --> 01:28:26.434]  He is a legal terrorist.
[01:28:26.434 --> 01:28:34.779]  And this Russia investigation that we know is fake, they claim that they had this information, but the DNC, the DCCC haven't even turned over the server.
[01:28:34.779 --> 01:28:35.340]  So how do you have it?
[01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:37.261]  Larry Klayman, thank you so much.
[01:28:37.261 --> 01:28:38.081]  You're doing great work.
[01:28:38.081 --> 01:28:39.441]  Freedomwatchusa.org.
[01:28:39.441 --> 01:28:41.082]  Folks, go to that website.
[01:28:41.082 --> 01:28:42.763]  Support Larry Klayman.
[01:28:42.763 --> 01:28:44.463]  We have to do this.
[01:28:44.463 --> 01:28:50.205]  If we're not going to take action for justice and for the Republic, then who will?
[01:28:50.205 --> 01:28:51.766]  I guess Russia apparently will.
[01:28:51.766 --> 01:28:52.846]  Will America?
[01:28:52.846 --> 01:28:53.366]  Let's see it!
[01:28:53.366 --> 01:28:54.527]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:57.193 --> 01:28:58.454]  I had great results.
[01:28:58.454 --> 01:28:59.855]  I lost 70 pounds.
[01:28:59.855 --> 01:29:03.096]  I weighed 265 and went down to 195.
[01:29:03.096 --> 01:29:05.818]  My doctor told me, if it works for you, then do it.
[01:29:05.818 --> 01:29:07.819]  A lot of people say to me, how did you lose the weight?
[01:29:07.819 --> 01:29:09.900]  I say, I take Andro 400 every day.
[01:29:09.900 --> 01:29:11.321]  I'm going to take it forever.
[01:29:11.321 --> 01:29:13.322]  That was Walt talking about Andro 400.
[01:29:13.322 --> 01:29:15.303]  Now listen to what Bob has to say.
[01:29:15.583 --> 01:29:22.710]  When you listen to your radio commercials, you say that's not possible, but since I've experienced it, your commercials aren't strong enough.
[01:29:22.710 --> 01:29:26.013]  I am 76, and I've had a belly for way too long.
[01:29:26.013 --> 01:29:30.798]  My whole body is shrinking, my energy level has gone up, and the only thing different is enter 400.
[01:29:30.798 --> 01:29:31.919]  It's great stuff.
[01:29:31.919 --> 01:29:33.741]  I tried other products and nothing happened.
[01:29:33.741 --> 01:29:34.121]  Guys.
[01:29:34.341 --> 01:29:34.541]  I think.
[01:29:59.031 --> 01:30:03.615]  Patrick, in the great nation of Australia, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:30:03.615 --> 01:30:04.176]  Thanks for calling.
[01:30:04.176 --> 01:30:05.617]  Hey Alex, mate.
[01:30:05.617 --> 01:30:09.221]  I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now.
[01:30:09.221 --> 01:30:13.985]  I remember back when InfoWars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen.
[01:30:13.985 --> 01:30:14.686]  Thank you very much.
[01:30:34.745 --> 01:30:43.348]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[01:30:43.348 --> 01:30:48.250]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[01:30:48.250 --> 01:30:53.492]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew, and the listeners out there, 1776 worldwide.
[01:30:58.325 --> 01:31:02.330]  Staying healthy on the go is just as important as staying healthy at home.
[01:31:02.330 --> 01:31:05.053]  But sometimes supplements don't work fast enough.
[01:31:05.053 --> 01:31:09.878]  That's why InfoWars Life has created a powerful new addition to the Super Blue line.
[01:31:09.878 --> 01:31:12.281]  Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle.
[01:31:12.281 --> 01:31:15.304]  Available in 1 oz., 3.5 oz., and 16 oz.

[01:33:00.757 --> 01:33:09.121]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:09.121 --> 01:33:17.066]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[01:33:17.066 --> 01:33:19.067]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:33:19.067 --> 01:33:19.867]  Yes, you hear the thunder?
[01:33:28.652 --> 01:33:32.153]  That's the thunder of America, baby.
[01:33:32.153 --> 01:33:50.278]  And all the corrupt bureaucrats and politicians are shaking in their little suits and ties, because they know the American people are awakened to all the crimes and lies that they have been committing to for decades.
[01:33:50.278 --> 01:33:51.698]  Wow.
[01:33:51.698 --> 01:33:54.339]  You know, to think about
[01:33:56.795 --> 01:34:14.709]  Rod Rosenstein saying today, in this indictments, in the indictments of the 12 Russians, that they know that it was the Russians that hacked the DNC and DCCC servers, miraculously considering that the DCCC and the DNC refused to turn those servers over.
[01:34:15.785 --> 01:34:32.550]  And I still say, if it was the Russians that released all of this data and all these documents on all the corruption going on in the Democrat Party, which then resulted in Hillary losing because she was so corrupt, and the Democrats were so corrupt, is that not a good thing?
[01:34:32.550 --> 01:34:38.211]  I don't know, but in London, we know this.
[01:34:38.211 --> 01:34:40.072]  They hate Donald Trump.
[01:34:40.072 --> 01:34:41.092]  They really don't know why.
[01:34:42.025 --> 01:34:44.689]  But they know they hate him, and they're marching!
[01:34:44.689 --> 01:34:47.294]  And they've got their Trump balloon!
[01:34:47.294 --> 01:34:50.859]  And so Paul Joseph Watson joins me now.
[01:34:50.859 --> 01:34:53.343]  Well, Paul, are you having fun?
[01:34:53.343 --> 01:34:56.649]  It seems like you're having some fun with these protesters out there.
[01:34:58.092 --> 01:35:02.674]  Well, it's always fun to highlight their idiocy, Owen, because they don't know what they're talking about.
[01:35:02.674 --> 01:35:05.236]  We had this Trump balloon big event.
[01:35:05.236 --> 01:35:12.280]  One week or more, probably 10 days of sustained, hardcore, intense media coverage, mainstream media coverage.
[01:35:12.280 --> 01:35:13.760]  This was going to be the big event.
[01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:16.342]  This was going to be the big rallying call.
[01:35:16.342 --> 01:35:20.824]  And this is not to say that they haven't got decent numbers in terms of protesters later on today.
[01:35:20.824 --> 01:35:23.225]  But this balloon event, this was the big deal.
[01:35:23.225 --> 01:35:26.147]  This was the entire media play for the whole week.
[01:35:26.787 --> 01:35:39.690]  The massive, the huge, the gigantic Trump balloon, and now you see on screen right there, in the middle of central London, in the main square, Parliament Square, they got about, what, four or five hundred people max?
[01:35:39.690 --> 01:35:45.191]  After one week of sustained mainstream media coverage, this was a global story.
[01:35:45.191 --> 01:35:56.253]  And you have to consider the fact, Owen, that tourists are milling around the area constantly, so I'd say at least a quarter of the bodies you see in that photograph are going to be tourists anyway, at least around the edges.
[01:35:56.713 --> 01:35:58.754]  So it was a pathetic failure.
[01:35:58.754 --> 01:36:02.497]  Of course, at the start of this, some people reacted in the wrong way.
[01:36:02.497 --> 01:36:07.360]  Some people on the right, Trump supporters, were saying, you know, oh, this is so offensive, they shouldn't be allowed to do that.
[01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:08.681]  No, that's not how you react.
[01:36:08.681 --> 01:36:09.962]  That is getting triggered.
[01:36:09.962 --> 01:36:14.865]  The proper way to react is to laugh, because this was completely pathetic.
[01:36:14.865 --> 01:36:19.348]  It was billed as a large protest, as you see there, BBC large-scale protest.
[01:36:19.348 --> 01:36:23.451]  It was billed as a giant, huge balloon that would fly over Parliament.
[01:36:23.451 --> 01:36:23.791]  In fact,
[01:36:24.654 --> 01:36:31.340]  If you go on my Twitter account right now, there's a meme that I posted, what I expected and what I got.
[01:36:31.340 --> 01:36:36.185]  And the way they promoted it was that this would be flying over the Houses of Parliament, it would be flying over London.
[01:36:36.185 --> 01:36:39.167]  They got it about 40 feet in the air.
[01:36:39.167 --> 01:36:42.410]  You couldn't even see it over the nearest adjacent building.
[01:36:42.410 --> 01:36:46.134]  So nobody could see it unless they were in that sparse group of people within the square.
[01:36:46.787 --> 01:36:48.128]  And it was tiny.
[01:36:48.128 --> 01:36:49.769]  It was too small to be seen.
[01:36:49.769 --> 01:36:52.650]  It was up there in the air for less than two hours.
[01:36:52.650 --> 01:36:53.851]  Then it came down.
[01:36:53.851 --> 01:36:56.212]  People were asking me, oh, how do I find the Trump balloon?
[01:36:56.212 --> 01:36:57.593]  I want to go and see the Trump balloon.
[01:36:57.593 --> 01:37:02.135]  It had already come down by the time people were asking or by the time anyone cared about it.
[01:37:02.135 --> 01:37:07.198]  So the proper reaction was to laugh at it because you knew it was going to be a pathetic failure.
[01:37:07.198 --> 01:37:09.479]  And that's exactly what turned out to happen.
[01:37:09.479 --> 01:37:14.662]  Yeah, I remember when they first released this story a week or so ago, they were dubbing it a blimp.
[01:37:15.362 --> 01:37:20.564]  They were saying they have confirmed the Trump baby blimp.
[01:37:20.564 --> 01:37:21.945]  Blimps are actually big.
[01:37:21.945 --> 01:37:24.546]  What you have there is a party balloon.
[01:37:24.546 --> 01:37:25.327]  That was pathetic.
[01:37:26.243 --> 01:37:29.184]  It's not exactly Goodyear blimp size, is it?
[01:37:29.184 --> 01:37:40.089]  But the thing to think about as well with this is, you know, we had a fundraiser, I at least helped with it, and they've got a big event coming up next month for a Sadiq Khan baby balloon.
[01:37:40.089 --> 01:37:46.051]  And the thing is, even though with intense 10-day media coverage for this Trump blimp, the giant blimp that wasn't
[01:37:46.730 --> 01:37:48.413]  They raised £30,000.
[01:37:48.413 --> 01:37:51.757]  And by the way, how on earth does this party balloon cost £30,000?
[01:37:51.757 --> 01:37:53.680]  That's about $40,000.
[01:37:53.680 --> 01:37:57.846]  What on earth are they doing with that money, by the way?
[01:37:57.846 --> 01:38:01.051]  But we raised more money than they did in 30 days, in three days!
[01:38:03.314 --> 01:38:06.495]  It shows you how pathetic the mainstream media is now.
[01:38:06.495 --> 01:38:09.476]  They can barely get 500 people to a protest.
[01:38:09.476 --> 01:38:12.457]  It takes them a month to raise £30,000.
[01:38:12.457 --> 01:38:14.238]  We did it in three days.
[01:38:14.238 --> 01:38:22.820]  And there's going to be a big event next month with people, victims of violent crime in London, victims of the Sadiq carnage, getting up on stage, giving speeches.
[01:38:22.820 --> 01:38:24.621]  It's going to be a big, big protest event.
[01:38:25.101 --> 01:38:27.284]  Bigger than this one, I can promise you that.
[01:38:27.284 --> 01:38:29.387]  And hopefully a bigger balloon.
[01:38:29.387 --> 01:38:31.129]  But that's already completely funded.
[01:38:31.129 --> 01:38:42.102]  In fact, they're getting close to like £60,000 at this point, which is about $80,000 in about the space of a week with no positive mainstream media coverage.
[01:38:42.102 --> 01:38:44.425]  So again, that just shows you how committed, how loyal
[01:38:44.985 --> 01:38:52.991]  Our audience and the true freedom, the true free speech audiences, we completely kicked their butt on fundraising with no media attention.
[01:38:52.991 --> 01:39:00.737]  This was a complete failure and our event, or at least the one that I'm supporting, is going to be a giant success.
[01:39:00.737 --> 01:39:07.122]  And you've got the Tommy Robinson march tomorrow as well that I'm expecting to be massive.
[01:39:07.122 --> 01:39:12.606]  But I'm just curious, so is the plan with the Sadiq Khan balloon, is it to make it a baby?
[01:39:12.606 --> 01:39:13.207]  Is that the plan?
[01:39:14.628 --> 01:39:16.008]  Yeah, they're going to make it a baby.
[01:39:16.008 --> 01:39:27.711]  In fact, what was funny, Sadiq Khan was asked himself by Piers Morgan a couple of days ago on television, what if somebody made a giant pig balloon of you and made it look half like Sadiq Khan, half like a pig?
[01:39:27.711 --> 01:39:28.731]  Would that be allowed?
[01:39:28.731 --> 01:39:31.252]  You know, sounds pretty Islamophobic to me.
[01:39:31.252 --> 01:39:32.592]  Would he allow that?
[01:39:32.592 --> 01:39:33.813]  So the question remains.
[01:39:33.813 --> 01:39:35.453]  They haven't got approval for it yet.
[01:39:35.453 --> 01:39:37.854]  They're still waiting for all the funding to come in.
[01:39:37.854 --> 01:39:39.754]  So yeah, they're going to have this big protest event.
[01:39:39.754 --> 01:39:43.195]  They're going to fly the Sadiq Khan baby balloon
[01:39:43.895 --> 01:39:46.118]  Over the protest and it's going to be huge.
[01:39:46.118 --> 01:39:50.502]  It's going to be way bigger than this one with with no media coverage in comparison.
[01:39:50.502 --> 01:39:57.729]  By the way, this is like, Owen, this is like you remember those Hillary Clinton rallies where CNN had the cameras really in tight on the crowd.
[01:39:57.729 --> 01:40:01.373]  So it looked like it was it was well attended as soon as they drew back.
[01:40:02.393 --> 01:40:05.495]  The arena was like three quarters empty.
[01:40:05.495 --> 01:40:06.996]  That's the equivalent that we're seeing.
[01:40:06.996 --> 01:40:11.818]  Yeah, they couldn't even get a full audience with LeBron James and Jay-Z.
[01:40:11.818 --> 01:40:14.160]  Nobody would even still show up to support Hillary.
[01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:15.340]  But hey, you know what?
[01:40:15.340 --> 01:40:22.024]  I gotta say, I think that they should, and maybe you can help, maybe you can pull some strings on this, I think they should change it.
[01:40:22.024 --> 01:40:23.805]  They shouldn't go with the baby.
[01:40:23.805 --> 01:40:27.407]  They should do Sadiq Khan and they should dress him up like a terrorist.
[01:40:27.887 --> 01:40:30.509]  With a bunch of blood on his hands and like a knife and stuff.
[01:40:30.509 --> 01:40:31.310]  That's what they should do.
[01:40:31.310 --> 01:40:33.171]  That's a way more powerful message.
[01:40:33.171 --> 01:40:35.954]  Especially if you're gonna have the victims of all the violent crimes speaking.
[01:40:35.954 --> 01:40:36.154]  Yeah.
[01:40:37.270 --> 01:40:45.212]  Yeah, you could do something where he's literally got blood on his hands because of the soaring violent crime, the acid attacks that have taken place under his watch.
[01:40:45.212 --> 01:40:47.832]  So they haven't designed it yet, as far as I know.
[01:40:47.832 --> 01:40:49.993]  They only started the project like a week ago.
[01:40:49.993 --> 01:40:51.653]  The money's still rolling in.
[01:40:51.653 --> 01:40:57.974]  So the design for the balloon itself, which is being called a balloon, it's not being called a blimp, but the design for it is still open.
[01:40:57.974 --> 01:41:02.075]  So that's definitely, would probably make more sense given the nature of the event.
[01:41:02.793 --> 01:41:09.739]  Yeah, I think that that would be really powerful imagery too, considering the messages that are going to be going on with it.
[01:41:09.739 --> 01:41:18.186]  But you've got the Trump protests going on in London today, and you've got the Tommy Robinson march happening tomorrow.
[01:41:18.186 --> 01:41:23.451]  I mean, people in London are really amped up right now, Paul.
[01:41:23.451 --> 01:41:24.612]  They're hitting the streets every day.
[01:41:26.539 --> 01:41:27.400]  Well, this is the thing.
[01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:31.302]  I mean, there are some worthwhile protests and others not so worthwhile.
[01:41:31.302 --> 01:41:42.269]  The idea of protests now, you know, 20, 20, 30 years ago, the idea of taking part in a giant mass protest was seen as something that was still quite rare, like 20, 30 years ago.
[01:41:42.269 --> 01:41:44.931]  Now it's literally every single weekend, okay?
[01:41:45.689 --> 01:41:47.470]  These aren't working class people.
[01:41:47.470 --> 01:41:53.153]  I was at the Remain protest for staying in the EU, you know, overriding democracy, ignoring the vote.
[01:41:53.153 --> 01:41:57.836]  It was all like old white people, like 60, 70 years old.
[01:41:57.836 --> 01:42:03.459]  It was very odd because of course the propaganda is, oh young people voted against this, this is all a young people's movement.
[01:42:03.459 --> 01:42:04.560]  It really wasn't.
[01:42:04.560 --> 01:42:07.542]  But literally it's become like a day out for these people.
[01:42:07.542 --> 01:42:12.885]  It's not just the fact they get to Virtue Signal and take the selfie for their Instagram feed or whatever.
[01:42:12.885 --> 01:42:13.265]  They literally
[01:42:13.365 --> 01:42:13.745]  We're good to go.
[01:42:35.626 --> 01:42:36.927]  They're really not having any impact.
[01:42:36.927 --> 01:42:37.987]  They don't know why they're even there.
[01:42:37.987 --> 01:42:38.587]  Wait, wait, wait.
[01:42:38.587 --> 01:42:40.588]  Is this your footage right here that they're showing?
[01:42:40.588 --> 01:42:42.069]  Is this you out on the streets with them?
[01:42:42.069 --> 01:42:44.390]  I tweet... That's not me.
[01:42:44.390 --> 01:42:45.130]  I tweeted that.
[01:42:45.130 --> 01:42:45.590]  I tweeted that.
[01:42:45.590 --> 01:42:48.091]  It's basically someone yelling at a helicopter.
[01:42:48.091 --> 01:42:51.292]  You need to get out there and question these people, Paul!
[01:42:51.292 --> 01:42:53.353]  Get into the arena, Paul Joseph Watson!
[01:42:53.353 --> 01:42:54.374]  Take them down!
[01:42:54.374 --> 01:42:55.734]  Take them face on!
[01:42:55.734 --> 01:42:56.755]  Crush their spirit!
[01:42:57.515 --> 01:42:59.457]  This 4th of July is special.
[01:42:59.457 --> 01:43:01.459]  Everybody can see it, they can feel it.
[01:43:01.459 --> 01:43:05.904]  The globalists are attempting to kill a worldwide awakening to their tyranny.
[01:43:05.904 --> 01:43:10.268]  And America, yet again, is at the heart of the resistance of the globalists.
[01:43:10.268 --> 01:43:15.374]  That's why this 4th of July I'm asking all of our great supporters to think about Infowars now more than ever.
[01:43:15.374 --> 01:43:19.117]  And what would the world be like if Infowars wasn't there resisting the globalists?
[01:43:19.958 --> 01:43:22.240]  What would have happened if you hadn't supported InfoWars?
[01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:24.201]  We would not be having the victories we have today.
[01:43:24.201 --> 01:43:27.344]  So yes, a lot of good things are happening, but the enemy is striking back.

[01:44:58.624 --> 01:45:02.568]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[01:45:02.568 --> 01:45:05.851]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[01:45:05.851 --> 01:45:12.137]  But a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[01:45:12.137 --> 01:45:14.899]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[01:45:15.640 --> 01:45:19.464]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[01:45:19.464 --> 01:45:25.931]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[01:45:25.931 --> 01:45:30.897]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[01:45:31.638 --> 01:45:35.561]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[01:45:35.561 --> 01:45:42.765]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[01:45:42.765 --> 01:45:47.989]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[01:45:47.989 --> 01:45:53.672]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[01:45:53.672 --> 01:45:57.655]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[01:45:58.757 --> 01:46:03.618]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[01:46:03.618 --> 01:46:13.060]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins and minerals needed daily.

[01:47:01.771 --> 01:47:10.075]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:10.075 --> 01:47:15.878]  Paul Joseph Watson is with me here and it's incredible
[01:47:23.815 --> 01:47:28.882]  How much losing the left is enduring right now.
[01:47:28.882 --> 01:47:31.025]  I mean, you gotta give it to them.
[01:47:31.025 --> 01:47:33.087]  They really can endure losing.
[01:47:33.087 --> 01:47:34.990]  And they just take it.
[01:47:36.704 --> 01:47:37.745]  Now you see the response.
[01:47:37.745 --> 01:47:39.007]  They get rabid out there.
[01:47:39.007 --> 01:47:40.830]  They're getting violent.
[01:47:40.830 --> 01:47:48.821]  They're trying to stage events like a Trump baby balloon protest that turns out to be a massive failure.
[01:47:48.821 --> 01:47:50.083]  Let's pull up that image again.
[01:47:50.083 --> 01:47:53.287]  I mean, Paul, it's actually laughable.
[01:47:54.108 --> 01:47:55.348]  How pathetic this is.
[01:47:55.348 --> 01:47:56.269]  They build this up.
[01:47:56.269 --> 01:47:58.049]  They say, oh, it's going to be a huge balloon.
[01:47:58.049 --> 01:47:58.829]  Everybody will see it.
[01:47:58.829 --> 01:48:00.670]  It will draw a bunch of attention.
[01:48:00.670 --> 01:48:06.392]  It ends up being like a 10-foot deal that can't even get above the smallest building.
[01:48:06.392 --> 01:48:12.913]  It kind of, really, in a way, Paul, I think it's a representation of everything that they are.
[01:48:12.913 --> 01:48:16.374]  A bunch of loudmouth blowhards.
[01:48:16.374 --> 01:48:18.335]  And when it comes time to deliver, they can't.
[01:48:20.157 --> 01:48:21.238]  No, precisely.
[01:48:21.238 --> 01:48:23.699]  It's the way this was framed as well.
[01:48:23.699 --> 01:48:27.942]  They framed it as being like a satirical thing which was anti-establishment.
[01:48:27.942 --> 01:48:30.343]  That was the rhetoric that surrounded all this.
[01:48:30.343 --> 01:48:40.489]  So it's literally like some trust fund kid who comes from a rich political family, who owns a two million pound townhouse in London, who was behind this project, organising it.
[01:48:40.489 --> 01:48:43.751]  They got immediate approval from the establishment
[01:48:44.443 --> 01:48:55.871]  They got a week of intensive establishment media coverage, yet they were all over these same media networks, you know, he was on CNN, BBC, Sky News or whatever, saying this was an anti-establishment protest.
[01:48:55.871 --> 01:48:56.872]  No, it's not!
[01:48:56.872 --> 01:49:00.755]  You're not marching against the establishment, you're in with the establishment.
[01:49:00.755 --> 01:49:06.979]  You're flying the EU flag, the ultimate symbol of cronyism, the ultimate symbol of the establishment, okay?
[01:49:07.359 --> 01:49:12.221]  The entire raison d'etre of the Trump administration is taking on the deep state.
[01:49:12.221 --> 01:49:13.782]  It's to be anti-establishment.
[01:49:13.782 --> 01:49:20.325]  So when you're marching against that, you put yourself directly in line on the same side as the establishment.
[01:49:20.325 --> 01:49:23.426]  And it's just the hypocrisy of it, Owen.
[01:49:23.426 --> 01:49:25.607]  In America, it's kind of more violent.
[01:49:25.607 --> 01:49:26.707]  You have people acting out.
[01:49:26.707 --> 01:49:27.968]  You have Antifa and stuff.
[01:49:28.562 --> 01:49:33.565]  Here in the UK, in London, it's more like some soppy middle class day out.
[01:49:33.565 --> 01:49:35.186]  They've got their picnic hampers.
[01:49:35.186 --> 01:49:45.291]  It's got to the point where it's basically now a fancy dress party to go out every other weekend in London and protest about whatever grave injustice has just happened next.
[01:49:45.291 --> 01:49:46.412]  But it's the hypocrisy.
[01:49:46.412 --> 01:49:47.993]  I made the point in my video.
[01:49:48.513 --> 01:49:54.217]  You know, we've had several visits from actual dictators to London over the past three years.
[01:49:54.217 --> 01:49:56.938]  The protests were absolutely minimal.
[01:49:56.938 --> 01:50:00.420]  So you can look at it and think, so what are you protesting Trump for?
[01:50:00.420 --> 01:50:03.182]  Oh, he said, grab him by the pussy 13 years ago.
[01:50:03.182 --> 01:50:04.703]  Oh my God, what a misogynist.
[01:50:05.043 --> 01:50:14.833]  Okay, so where were you when Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia visited the UK, on a state visit by the way, a full state visit.
[01:50:14.833 --> 01:50:20.039]  They didn't even give Trump a state visit because our government, our conservative in name only government,
[01:50:20.712 --> 01:50:20.792]  It's
[01:50:38.883 --> 01:50:41.825]  Women have to have a male guardian follow them everywhere.
[01:50:41.825 --> 01:50:48.130]  They have to have male guardian approval to open a bank account, to travel anywhere, to do anything.
[01:50:48.130 --> 01:50:56.617]  You've got women in Saudi Arabia, there was another famous case of it just last week I believe, being imprisoned and tortured for not wearing a hijab.
[01:50:57.097 --> 01:51:02.141]  Oh, but who are you going to be out on the streets protesting against because he's an evil misogynist?
[01:51:02.141 --> 01:51:07.565]  Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman or Donald Trump because he said grab him by the posse 13 years ago?
[01:51:07.565 --> 01:51:12.268]  It's Donald Trump in their thousands, in their tens of thousands.
[01:51:12.268 --> 01:51:14.249]  You can look at, you know, Erdogan.
[01:51:14.249 --> 01:51:16.391]  He came to the UK a few months ago.
[01:51:16.391 --> 01:51:23.836]  We've got this narrative about Trump being a massive threat to freedom of the press, his anti-media rhetoric, it's dangerous, it's frightening.
[01:51:24.824 --> 01:51:33.171]  Meanwhile, Erdogan, a guy who literally jails more journalists than any other country on earth, visits the UK.
[01:51:33.171 --> 01:51:40.777]  This is a man who, before he even left London on his state visit, called journalists that he had imprisoned terrorists.
[01:51:40.777 --> 01:51:44.480]  While he was up giving a speech with Theresa May, literally called them terrorists.
[01:51:44.480 --> 01:51:45.221]  This is a guy who's
[01:51:46.022 --> 01:51:52.491]  ...eliminated over 100 media outlets in Turkey since 2016 by decree.
[01:51:52.491 --> 01:51:54.955]  He just says, shut it down, it gets shut down.
[01:51:54.955 --> 01:51:58.380]  You saw the footage in DC, I believe, what was it, late last year?
[01:51:58.380 --> 01:52:01.103]  His goons beating up protesters in Washington DC.
[01:52:01.744 --> 01:52:11.487]  So again, this is a guy, an actual dictator, an Islamist dictator, who openly shuts down media outlets, openly imprisons journalists and calls them terrorists.
[01:52:11.487 --> 01:52:15.208]  He's a genuine threat to freedom of the press in his country.
[01:52:15.208 --> 01:52:19.549]  He visits London, visits the UK, protests, barely any.
[01:52:19.549 --> 01:52:23.951]  Oh, but Donald Trump said something mean about CNN a few times.
[01:52:23.951 --> 01:52:24.911]  100,000 people on the streets.
[01:52:25.331 --> 01:52:27.171]  That's the level of hypocrisy.
[01:52:27.171 --> 01:52:33.873]  That's what really gets me every time with these virtue signaling middle-class morons.
[01:52:33.873 --> 01:52:36.093]  Well, but think about the optics of this.
[01:52:36.093 --> 01:52:46.855]  Let's, let's flash forward, let's say 50 years into the future, and you're reading a history textbook, and it talks about the Trump protests with the baby balloon.
[01:52:46.855 --> 01:52:48.875]  Okay, think about what people are going to think.
[01:52:48.875 --> 01:52:52.756]  They're going to, this is a group of mentally deranged
[01:52:53.909 --> 01:52:55.390]  Eh, lunatics!
[01:52:55.390 --> 01:52:56.531]  I mean, that's what these people are.
[01:52:56.531 --> 01:53:02.295]  It's like, they don't even think, like, oh yeah, it'll be cool, it'll be funny, we'll have a Trump baby balloon.
[01:53:02.295 --> 01:53:04.517]  Well, what the hell does that even mean?
[01:53:04.517 --> 01:53:06.398]  You're the ones that are behaving like babies.
[01:53:06.398 --> 01:53:09.140]  So it's like, it's like, what, I mean, what are they even thinking?
[01:53:09.140 --> 01:53:14.183]  Like, what is the, what is the goal behind a baby balloon?
[01:53:14.183 --> 01:53:17.866]  Like, what is the message that you're sending other than I'm a deranged lunatic?
[01:53:20.484 --> 01:53:23.574]  The goal, in their own words, was to hurt President Trump's feelings.
[01:53:26.460 --> 01:53:29.102]  He's not even in London at this point.
[01:53:29.102 --> 01:53:31.644]  Nobody could even see the balloon over the nearest building.
[01:53:31.644 --> 01:53:32.984]  It's so small.
[01:53:32.984 --> 01:53:35.546]  But Owen, he's a Nazi.
[01:53:35.546 --> 01:53:37.908]  He's imposing a dictatorship.
[01:53:37.908 --> 01:53:43.451]  We had President Xi Jinping of China visit a few years ago to London, again on a state visit.
[01:53:43.451 --> 01:53:46.934]  This is a guy who's literally trying to abolish presidential term limits.
[01:53:46.934 --> 01:53:49.055]  He jails his political rivals.
[01:53:49.055 --> 01:53:50.556]  He puts dissenters in prison.
[01:53:50.556 --> 01:53:51.537]  They're tortured to death.
[01:53:52.077 --> 01:53:58.100]  People who lived during the Mao era are now saying that this guy could be bringing that kind of level of tyranny back.
[01:53:58.100 --> 01:54:01.701]  Oh yeah, not the Chinese dictator that just got more power than Mao ever had.
[01:54:01.701 --> 01:54:03.782]  Yeah.
[01:54:03.782 --> 01:54:06.563]  Yeah, and he visits, and who's out on the streets?
[01:54:06.563 --> 01:54:16.027]  Now obviously, you know, I don't expect people to protest absolutely everybody who visits, but just have some intellectual consistency, for God's sake.
[01:54:16.027 --> 01:54:19.188]  Well, how can they have intellectual consistency when they don't even have intellect, Paul?
[01:54:20.026 --> 01:54:20.546]  Exactly.
[01:54:20.546 --> 01:54:24.228]  It's a tough one, isn't it?
[01:54:24.228 --> 01:54:30.050]  The Trump balloon, it almost ended up being like a celebration of Trump, if you think about it.
[01:54:30.050 --> 01:54:33.291]  I mean, all these people came out with a, ooh, balloon, ooh!
[01:54:34.409 --> 01:54:36.131]  I mean, you also had Green Day.
[01:54:36.131 --> 01:54:38.354]  You remember the Green Day song, American Idiot?
[01:54:38.354 --> 01:54:40.477]  You know, it's like over 10 years old now.
[01:54:40.477 --> 01:54:44.882]  But they bought it and so they made it go to number one in the UK charts.
[01:54:44.882 --> 01:54:49.769]  You read the lyrics of this Green Day song, which I remember from, you know, 10 years ago, the lyrics
[01:54:50.209 --> 01:54:51.890]  Can you hear the sound of hysteria?
[01:54:51.890 --> 01:54:53.791]  One nation controlled by the media.
[01:54:53.791 --> 01:54:59.393]  This is a song about how the media whips up hysteria and controls a nation with propaganda.
[01:54:59.393 --> 01:55:05.515]  The exact same rhetoric, the exact same narrative that Trump says at literally every rally he attends.
[01:55:05.515 --> 01:55:11.338]  So they made a pro-Trump song go to number one and thought that they'd owned Trump by doing so.
[01:55:11.338 --> 01:55:15.559]  I mean, the sheer lack of intelligence is shocking to behold.
[01:55:15.559 --> 01:55:19.061]  You know, and that's kind of another story in and of itself, Paul, where
[01:55:19.994 --> 01:55:33.328]  You know, you've got all these people in the entertainment industry that would have you believe that they're anti-establishment, you know, write lyrics about being anti-establishment, maybe say something about anti-establishment corruption in government.
[01:55:33.328 --> 01:55:40.996]  And then Trump comes along, he's the epitome of everything that's against the establishment, everything that's against the corporate fake news.
[01:55:42.153 --> 01:55:42.934]  And they hate him.
[01:55:42.934 --> 01:55:48.899]  I mean, it's like, you know what's going on, you've called it out, and then Trump is everything that it's not.
[01:55:48.899 --> 01:55:52.562]  He's everything that fights the corporate mainstream fake news.
[01:55:52.562 --> 01:55:53.983]  And I don't understand it.
[01:55:53.983 --> 01:55:55.965]  Like, do they really not get it?
[01:55:55.965 --> 01:55:57.627]  Or do they fall for the fake news?
[01:55:57.627 --> 01:55:59.528]  Or are they owned by someone?
[01:55:59.528 --> 01:56:00.649]  I mean, how do you explain that?
[01:56:00.649 --> 01:56:06.915]  Because Green Day hates Trump, and yet they write about the fake news that jostles up all the hysteria.
[01:56:08.271 --> 01:56:27.256]  Well obviously they know Owen, that as soon as they, even if they don't criticise Trump, which is, this is what Taylor Swift got heat for, for, you know, like two years at this point, for not attacking Trump, even if they just try to stay out of it, they know as long as they don't get on board with the rhetoric, with the narrative, their careers will be ruined.
[01:56:27.256 --> 01:56:37.379]  I mean, this is why we literally had to have secret societies of Conservatives in Hollywood back a few years ago, before even those were disbanded, because they couldn't let slip that they were even Conservatives.
[01:56:37.799 --> 01:56:43.062]  You know, James Woods, great actor, been in numerous massive films in the 70s and 80s.
[01:56:43.062 --> 01:56:46.784]  He basically can never work again in Hollywood now because he's a conservative.
[01:56:46.784 --> 01:56:53.647]  So they know that these people are savage and they will ruin your career if you dare step out of line once.
[01:56:53.647 --> 01:56:54.908]  Oh, but they're the tolerant ones.
[01:56:54.908 --> 01:56:56.589]  They've got intellectual tolerance.
[01:56:56.589 --> 01:56:58.870]  Again, complete double standards, but they know
[01:56:59.716 --> 01:57:00.897]  They know how the game works.
[01:57:00.897 --> 01:57:03.140]  They're not going to risk their precious careers.
[01:57:03.140 --> 01:57:06.324]  So they're supreme hypocrites every single time.
[01:57:06.324 --> 01:57:07.986]  You know, and here's a perfect example.
[01:57:07.986 --> 01:57:09.707]  You bring up Taylor Swift.
[01:57:09.707 --> 01:57:10.629]  Let me just explain something.
[01:57:11.597 --> 01:57:17.520]  Uh, let's just compare Taylor Swift and Cardi B. Cardi B, total establishment pawn.
[01:57:17.520 --> 01:57:20.422]  Uh, total Illuminati puppet.
[01:57:20.422 --> 01:57:21.122]  Okay?
[01:57:21.122 --> 01:57:23.823]  She has to be anti-whatever to go with the message.
[01:57:23.823 --> 01:57:24.964]  Taylor Swift doesn't have to be.
[01:57:24.964 --> 01:57:25.804]  You know why?
[01:57:25.804 --> 01:57:27.245]  She writes her own music.
[01:57:27.245 --> 01:57:28.626]  She writes her own lyrics.
[01:57:28.626 --> 01:57:30.067]  She produces her own album.
[01:57:30.067 --> 01:57:31.567]  So they can't shut her down!
[01:57:31.567 --> 01:57:35.469]  Whereas everyone else in the media is run and operated by someone else.
[01:57:35.469 --> 01:57:36.410]  So that's what it's all about.
[01:57:36.570 --> 01:57:38.191]  That's why they can't beat Infowars.
[01:57:38.191 --> 01:57:39.492]  That's why they can't beat Trump.
[01:57:39.492 --> 01:57:41.014]  That's why they can't beat Taylor Swift.
[01:57:41.014 --> 01:57:42.895]  We're self-made, bitch!
[01:57:42.895 --> 01:57:45.798]  Learn it, get it, and lose to it every time!
[01:57:47.230 --> 01:57:57.813]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[01:57:57.813 --> 01:57:59.873]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[01:57:59.873 --> 01:58:02.734]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[01:58:02.734 --> 01:58:04.234]  It's made in the USA.
[01:58:04.234 --> 01:58:07.355]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[01:58:07.595 --> 01:58:11.057]  Absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[01:58:11.057 --> 01:58:13.138]  It is a classical 360 win.
[01:58:13.138 --> 01:58:22.843]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.

[01:59:57.894 --> 02:00:06.436]  You are listening to an Infowars.com frontline report.
[02:00:06.436 --> 02:00:11.057]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:11.057 --> 02:00:14.738]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:00:14.738 --> 02:00:20.819]  Savagely destroying the lies of the corporate media.
[02:00:20.819 --> 02:00:24.980]  Savaging the lives of the Democrat Party.
[02:00:24.980 --> 02:00:26.100]  You know what's amazing?
[02:00:27.814 --> 02:00:42.099]  All of the, well, let's just say cowardly Republicans that have been afraid to speak up on the Hill during these Congressional hearings are now getting fed up and starting to take the gloves off.
[02:00:42.099 --> 02:00:48.542]  And I've got a bunch of clips we're going to get to of the Peter Stroke testimony in this third hour.
[02:00:48.542 --> 02:00:51.963]  But first, you know, this is really not up for debate.
[02:00:53.206 --> 02:00:58.889]  Democrat-run cities across the nation are the most impoverished cities in America.
[02:00:58.889 --> 02:01:04.853]  Democrat-run cities in America are the most crime-ridden cities in America.
[02:01:04.853 --> 02:01:17.300]  Democrat-run cities in America are the most disgusting, foul state when it comes to just optics and health than any other places in America.
[02:01:17.300 --> 02:01:18.821]  It's always run by Democrats.
[02:01:19.775 --> 02:01:25.280]  Take a look at a recent report when it comes to what the Democrats have done to San Francisco.
[02:01:28.172 --> 02:01:36.617]  Turning away from the city by the bay, a major convention pulls out of San Francisco, saying its members don't feel safe on the streets.
[02:01:36.617 --> 02:01:38.137]  Good evening, I'm Elizabeth Cook.
[02:01:38.137 --> 02:01:39.118]  I'm Alan Martin.
[02:01:39.118 --> 02:01:41.599]  Locals know it, and visitors are shocked by it.
[02:01:41.599 --> 02:01:46.282]  The reality of San Francisco's streets is a far cry from its postcard image.
[02:01:46.282 --> 02:01:49.443]  Now the city just lost out on a huge moneymaker.
[02:01:49.443 --> 02:01:54.426]  KPIX 5's Phil McTierre joins us in a big convention leaving town and might not be the last.
[02:01:54.426 --> 02:01:54.546]  Phil?
[02:01:56.955 --> 02:01:59.218]  That's right, headquarters.
[02:01:59.218 --> 02:02:01.882]  I'm standing in the middle of the San Francisco streets.
[02:02:01.882 --> 02:02:06.068]  I've stepped in human feces on five different occasions just walking one block.
[02:02:06.068 --> 02:02:08.031]  I also stepped on a dirty needle.
[02:02:08.031 --> 02:02:09.493]  I actually have to go to the hospital now.
[02:02:09.493 --> 02:02:13.739]  I'm gonna have to conclude this broadcast because I got pricked with a dirty needle on the streets of San Francisco.
[02:02:13.899 --> 02:02:16.222]  You can smell it like in... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:02:16.222 --> 02:02:18.224]  Third world country, but it's not as bad as this.
[02:02:31.078 --> 02:02:35.622]  And now it's seriously affecting the city's biggest business, tourism.
[02:02:35.622 --> 02:02:39.406]  They feel their safety is at risk because they're seeing so many people that are having issues.
[02:02:39.406 --> 02:02:40.987]  They see people laying on the streets.
[02:02:40.987 --> 02:02:43.409]  There's a bunch of bombs going on in the streets.
[02:02:43.409 --> 02:02:50.656]  Tourism is a $9 billion a year industry in San Francisco, so officials have been reluctant to go public with the problems.
[02:02:50.656 --> 02:02:53.279]  In part, because it makes the city look bad.
[02:02:53.279 --> 02:02:54.420]  And it's bad for business.
[02:02:54.420 --> 02:02:55.461]  You know, restaurants,
[02:02:56.201 --> 02:02:56.902]  Taxis.
[02:02:56.902 --> 02:02:59.883]  People spend more money outside a hotel than inside.
[02:02:59.883 --> 02:03:02.625]  And for that reason, it's something we should all be concerned about.
[02:03:02.625 --> 02:03:04.626]  So basically the story is, alright, let's bring it down.
[02:03:04.626 --> 02:03:12.891]  The story is, this huge medical conference that used to go to San Francisco every year has pulled out because of the state costing the state $40 million.
[02:03:12.891 --> 02:03:15.453]  The story is, tourism in San Francisco is down because it's reached
[02:03:19.750 --> 02:03:28.436]  Just insane levels of poverty with all the homelessness, all the people in the street, the tent cities, I mean, the human feces in the street, like, what?
[02:03:28.436 --> 02:03:34.040]  Dirty needles just ridden all over the street.
[02:03:34.040 --> 02:03:43.226]  And then you see the images of these poor people, the homeless people that, you know, half of them look mentally ill and deranged and unhealthy.
[02:03:44.555 --> 02:03:49.258]  And you know, I mean, there's a soft spot in everyone for these people that are suffering.
[02:03:49.258 --> 02:04:09.149]  Nobody wants that, but what happens is, it's tough to explain, but it's a mental state where you get so comfortable doing whatever it is you're doing and getting the welfare that you can't get off it.
[02:04:11.537 --> 02:04:16.361]  You physically and mentally can't hurdle over that welfare now.
[02:04:16.361 --> 02:04:17.522]  That's your livelihood.
[02:04:17.522 --> 02:04:29.233]  And so you're now in this state of consciousness, this state of being where you can't work, you can't get a job, you can't do anything but sit on the streets and beg
[02:04:30.991 --> 02:04:33.814]  And hope the government gives you a handout.
[02:04:33.814 --> 02:04:36.456]  And this is all created by the Democrats.
[02:04:36.456 --> 02:04:41.721]  See, in America, you used to have to bust your butt to make it into your country.
[02:04:41.721 --> 02:04:42.682]  To make it in this country.
[02:04:42.682 --> 02:04:44.404]  So that was seared into your brain.
[02:04:44.404 --> 02:04:46.125]  Seared into your DNA.
[02:04:46.125 --> 02:04:48.127]  Now, it's seared into these people's brains.
[02:04:48.127 --> 02:04:51.931]  Just be lazy, be a bum, live in a tent city, the government will take care of everything.
[02:04:51.931 --> 02:04:53.913]  So this is all created by the Democrats.
[02:04:56.425 --> 02:04:58.766]  Fueling your body is hard work.

[02:06:04.893 --> 02:06:16.247]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show, and now your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:06:16.247 --> 02:06:21.994]  Not to get stuck on the story that we covered in the last segment, but this is a story from 2016 from Forbes.
[02:06:24.617 --> 02:06:46.244]  Politicians deserve some blame for urban decline, and it basically highlights all these inner cities that have been run by Democrats for decades that have just seen absolute destruction in the inner cities, an increase in poverty, a decrease in the quality of school, and it's just factual data that it's all run by Democrats.
[02:06:46.244 --> 02:06:50.245]  And it's not shocking to me that they use St.
[02:06:50.245 --> 02:06:52.706]  Louis, my hometown, as one of the greatest examples of this.
[02:06:54.096 --> 02:06:56.038]  Yeah, the Democrats have run the city of St.
[02:06:56.038 --> 02:06:59.983]  Louis into the ground.
[02:06:59.983 --> 02:07:06.831]  And it's just incredible how they continue to get elected.
[02:07:06.831 --> 02:07:10.415]  Really makes you wonder.
[02:07:10.415 --> 02:07:11.656]  But of course it's not just St.
[02:07:11.656 --> 02:07:13.819]  Louis, it's Pittsburgh, it's Detroit.
[02:07:15.498 --> 02:07:16.479]  It's Baltimore.
[02:07:16.479 --> 02:07:17.480]  It's Chicago.
[02:07:17.480 --> 02:07:19.221]  It's all run by Democrats.
[02:07:19.221 --> 02:07:28.948]  And all of those cities, under the reign of the Democrats, for decades, if they were really able to do anything, they've been in power for decades, they've done nothing, they would be able to steer the ship in the right direction.
[02:07:28.948 --> 02:07:31.770]  But it continues to go downhill.
[02:07:31.770 --> 02:07:38.015]  It continues to get worse under the Democrats.
[02:07:38.015 --> 02:07:41.637]  It's all about to change, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:07:41.637 --> 02:07:44.560]  It's all about to change.
[02:07:44.560 --> 02:07:44.880]  All right.
[02:07:46.491 --> 02:07:49.078]  Where to go from here?
[02:07:49.078 --> 02:07:52.588]  Why don't we hit the reset button?
[02:07:52.588 --> 02:07:54.272]  So you've had Rod Rosenstein
[02:07:56.089 --> 02:08:06.494]  Come out today and hold a press conference because Robert Mueller has just indicted 12 new Russians claiming that they worked in a Russian military operation to undermine the U.S.
[02:08:06.494 --> 02:08:15.698]  election and hack into Democrat servers and even tried to hack into the election systems even though they can't prove it and they won't say if they changed any votes.
[02:08:15.698 --> 02:08:19.780]  They've said in fact they didn't.
[02:08:19.780 --> 02:08:22.141]  But what's interesting about this
[02:08:23.422 --> 02:08:52.948]  Now they're claiming to know that it was Russians who coordinated with DC Leaks and Guccifer 2.0 and it was Russians that hacked the DNC and the DCCC and the Hillary campaign which is an incredible conclusion to reach considering the aforementioned entities, the DNC, the DCCC and the Hillary Clinton campaign did not turn over their servers!
[02:08:55.242 --> 02:09:11.728]  So how is it that Rob Mueller and Rod Rosenstein can tell us that the DNC and the DCCC were hacked by Russians when they refused to turn the servers over?
[02:09:11.728 --> 02:09:17.370]  Wonder if we'll ever get an answer to that question.
[02:09:17.370 --> 02:09:18.351]  So of course they
[02:09:19.502 --> 02:09:25.966]  Release this indictment and have this press conference on the eve of President Trump and President Putin's summit.
[02:09:25.966 --> 02:09:28.447]  First time they've had a one-on-one summit.
[02:09:28.447 --> 02:09:35.731]  You know, I think that they're scared to death of Putin.
[02:09:35.731 --> 02:09:43.776]  And they know that President Trump and President Putin will be having good faith negotiations and conversations.
[02:09:45.274 --> 02:10:04.162]  And you have to understand that the Democrats and the corporate media in this country have become so untrustworthy that they know that President Trump will trust President Putin more than them.
[02:10:04.162 --> 02:10:12.645]  And so he doesn't care if CNN and MSNBC and the Democrats want to sit here and cry Russian collusion for two straight years without any evidence.
[02:10:12.645 --> 02:10:13.866]  He's going to go meet with Putin.
[02:10:14.738 --> 02:10:19.682]  He's going to say, alright, you know what they're saying, I know what they're saying.
[02:10:19.682 --> 02:10:20.983]  What is really going on here?
[02:10:20.983 --> 02:10:22.585]  Is there anything?
[02:10:22.585 --> 02:10:29.811]  And my guess is Putin will most likely say, look, I mean, yeah, we've got Russian hackers and trolls and everything, and they do their thing, and I don't really know.
[02:10:29.811 --> 02:10:31.693]  I don't really care.
[02:10:31.693 --> 02:10:36.277]  Well, what about this claim that there is a military operation?
[02:10:36.277 --> 02:10:39.580]  And Putin might say, well, you know, we do have some stuff.
[02:10:39.580 --> 02:10:41.842]  Or he might say, no, there has nothing to do with that.
[02:10:43.032 --> 02:10:58.755]  But President Trump has now been put in a situation by the Democrats and by the corporate media to negotiate in good faith with Putin and to be more trustworthy of Putin because all they do is lie.
[02:10:58.755 --> 02:11:02.295]  And they've been lying about Trump since the day he decided to run for president.
[02:11:02.295 --> 02:11:05.216]  So that hasn't changed.
[02:11:05.216 --> 02:11:10.337]  So now on the eve of Trump and Putin set to meet, the Democrats in the deep state
[02:11:11.650 --> 02:11:20.297]  Put out this story of 13 Russian indictments, claim the Russian military is meddling in our elections, hacking all of these servers.
[02:11:20.297 --> 02:11:23.140]  Why are the Democrat servers so wide open anyway?
[02:11:23.140 --> 02:11:30.746]  And why is it that the information in the documents that they released was so damning?
[02:11:30.746 --> 02:11:33.188]  So they cannot win.
[02:11:33.188 --> 02:11:37.492]  They have no means to a victory with this story.
[02:11:38.379 --> 02:11:42.823]  Let's say that it's true and the Russians hacked the DNC and the DCCC.
[02:11:42.823 --> 02:11:46.125]  Okay, well tell us how you found that out because they won't turn over the servers.
[02:11:46.125 --> 02:11:49.488]  So, to quote Obama, what magic wand do you have?
[02:11:49.488 --> 02:11:58.775]  And then, okay, well what information was released because of the alleged hacking from the Russians?
[02:11:58.775 --> 02:12:00.536]  What is in these documents
[02:12:01.522 --> 02:12:04.765]  That was so damning to Hillary Clinton in the election.
[02:12:04.765 --> 02:12:06.686]  Oh, she rigged it from Bernie.
[02:12:06.686 --> 02:12:09.168]  Oh, they think that their voters are dumb effers.
[02:12:09.168 --> 02:12:12.491]  Oh, they were rigging presidential debates.
[02:12:12.491 --> 02:12:15.634]  Oh, they have $60,000 pizza parties.
[02:12:15.634 --> 02:12:17.856]  Oh, they have pizza related maps.
[02:12:17.856 --> 02:12:22.540]  Oh, they have hot tub parties with little children in it for your entertainment.
[02:12:22.540 --> 02:12:25.862]  Oh, oh, oh, that's what's going on.
[02:12:25.862 --> 02:12:27.604]  Oh, they have spirit cookings.
[02:12:31.638 --> 02:12:39.703]  And I'm supposed to be mad that Russia exposed how sick the heads of the Democrat Party are?
[02:12:39.703 --> 02:12:58.034]  I'm supposed to be mad that Russia has exposed how the Democrats rig elections, how the Democrats rig the media, collude with the media, how they think about their voters, how they think about the American people.
[02:12:58.034 --> 02:12:59.195]  I'm supposed to be mad
[02:13:00.287 --> 02:13:10.171]  That the Russians, or I guess, you know, they say it was a spear phishing attack for the DCCC.
[02:13:10.171 --> 02:13:12.572]  So I guess that's like the Podesta emails.
[02:13:12.572 --> 02:13:27.419]  But I'm supposed to be mad now that thanks to these hackers, I know that the Podestas and the Clintons are into spirit cookings where they rub, excuse me, semen and urine and feces on the wall.
[02:13:28.632 --> 02:13:31.874]  With messages where they cut themselves!
[02:13:31.874 --> 02:13:34.376]  Spirit cookings!
[02:13:34.376 --> 02:13:36.737]  Satan worshippers!
[02:13:36.737 --> 02:13:40.880]  And I'm supposed to be mad at the Russians?
[02:13:40.880 --> 02:13:44.823]  Well, hate to tell ya, I'm not.
[02:13:44.823 --> 02:13:47.164]  In fact, I like it.
[02:13:47.164 --> 02:13:57.111]  I like the fact that Democrat Adam Schiff is such a low IQ individual who cries Russian collusion all day long
[02:13:58.171 --> 02:14:05.135]  And then as soon as he gets a phone call from somebody he thinks is a Russian agent with dirt on Trump, what does he do?
[02:14:05.135 --> 02:14:12.940]  He jumps the hurdles to get that intel and it turns out he was duped.
[02:14:12.940 --> 02:14:16.002]  That's all these people.
[02:14:16.002 --> 02:14:16.983]  They're all duped.
[02:14:16.983 --> 02:14:23.246]  They're all tiny IQ morons that have somehow gotten into our government.
[02:14:23.246 --> 02:14:25.488]  It's time to drain the swamp.
[02:14:27.168 --> 02:14:39.211]  Man, there are the freaky faces of Peter Stroke from the testimony yesterday, which when I come back, we're going to start hitting all the video clips from the Peter Stroke testimony and highlight that.

[02:14:57.179 --> 02:14:59.440]  This story comes from NBC.
[02:14:59.440 --> 02:15:00.780]  Don't drink the water.
[02:15:00.780 --> 02:15:03.040]  DC warns of contamination risk.

[02:15:27.676 --> 02:15:31.377]  Okay, I don't want to drink the poison, so I have a water filter.

[02:18:20.874 --> 02:18:22.315]  You are the info war.

[02:18:26.520 --> 02:18:37.905]  That everyone go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.

[02:18:55.894 --> 02:19:00.035]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[02:19:00.035 --> 02:19:07.098]  InfoWars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower, and sink in your home.

[02:20:16.701 --> 02:20:20.029]  So here's the deal.
[02:20:20.029 --> 02:20:25.120]  Robert Mueller and Rob Rosenstein are trying to undermine
[02:20:26.337 --> 02:20:27.718]  The Trump-Putin Summit.
[02:20:27.718 --> 02:20:44.966]  After all, these are un-American, traitorous, treasonous actors here, Mueller and Rosenstein, that are trying to divert attention from their own corruption and trying to sabotage what would be good fake negotiations between Trump and Putin.
[02:20:44.966 --> 02:20:48.468]  Really sick, sad, twisted stuff that these two are up to.
[02:20:48.468 --> 02:20:50.068]  You have to wonder why.
[02:20:50.068 --> 02:20:51.869]  And the story is at InfoWars.com.
[02:20:53.710 --> 02:20:58.815]  NSA specialists contradict Rosenstein's DNC Russian hacking claim.
[02:20:58.815 --> 02:21:02.599]  This is how brazen they are, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:21:02.599 --> 02:21:07.183]  This is how brazen Mueller and Rosenstein are.
[02:21:07.183 --> 02:21:09.085]  They know!
[02:21:09.085 --> 02:21:12.328]  Anybody who knows anything about this story knows
[02:21:13.479 --> 02:21:26.844]  That the DNC and the DCCC refused to turn their servers over to the FBI, therefore they could never investigate as to who indeed hacked.
[02:21:26.844 --> 02:21:38.668]  And any intel and investigation that has already been done has all concluded the same thing, which is it was an internal job, not an external job.
[02:21:38.668 --> 02:21:40.569]  And that is all highlighted.
[02:21:41.676 --> 02:21:45.919]  In the story at Infowars.com right now.
[02:21:45.919 --> 02:21:48.021]  So do not be fooled.
[02:21:48.021 --> 02:22:00.470]  This is a 110% deep state sabotage of Trump and Putin meeting for the first time one-on-one.
[02:22:00.470 --> 02:22:02.211]  110%.
[02:22:02.211 --> 02:22:05.754]  There is nothing that will come from these indictments.
[02:22:05.754 --> 02:22:06.134]  Zero.
[02:22:07.273 --> 02:22:08.194]  Zero!
[02:22:08.194 --> 02:22:09.575]  Zero!
[02:22:09.575 --> 02:22:14.878]  In fact, oh my gosh, oh my gosh.
[02:22:14.878 --> 02:22:19.481]  I just realized what's actually going to happen.
[02:22:19.481 --> 02:22:22.583]  Oh, they are so screwed.
[02:22:22.583 --> 02:22:26.045]  Oh, they're so screwed, man.
[02:22:26.045 --> 02:22:27.326]  Here's what's going to happen.
[02:22:27.326 --> 02:22:33.230]  The Russians are going to show up for court again and demand discovery and Mueller's going to bail.
[02:22:37.438 --> 02:22:39.599]  History repeats itself, folks.
[02:22:39.599 --> 02:22:45.663]  Oh my God, I just can't, I mean, this is just, just devastating victory after victory.
[02:22:45.663 --> 02:22:48.364]  And these scumbags don't know what to do.
[02:22:48.364 --> 02:22:49.825]  They have no idea what to do.
[02:22:49.825 --> 02:22:54.407]  Just like the son that ran the story about Trump and Theresa May.
[02:22:54.407 --> 02:22:57.389]  Oh, and then Trump says, oh, you want to run that fake news story?
[02:22:57.389 --> 02:22:57.749]  Guess what?
[02:22:57.749 --> 02:23:02.572]  I've got the tapes to prove that you tried to schmear me.
[02:23:04.168 --> 02:23:05.769]  Ah, what did he say to James Comey?
[02:23:05.769 --> 02:23:07.190]  Hope there aren't tapes.
[02:23:07.190 --> 02:23:12.492]  President Trump has all of you beat!
[02:23:12.492 --> 02:23:21.076]  You see, you thought because you were able to get away with everything and everything was so corrupt that you were untouchable and you had a hubris.
[02:23:21.076 --> 02:23:22.417]  Well, it was a false hubris.
[02:23:22.417 --> 02:23:24.178]  You're a low IQ nitwit.
[02:23:24.178 --> 02:23:30.221]  President Trump is a stable genius and he's running laps around you and you're just trying to figure out what the hell's going on.
[02:23:30.221 --> 02:23:30.841]  You're dizzy!
[02:23:32.657 --> 02:23:33.918]  So what do you do?
[02:23:33.918 --> 02:23:42.604]  You announce more fake indictments from your fake Russia probe to sabotage Trump-Putin summit.
[02:23:42.604 --> 02:23:44.226]  It's not going to go well for you.
[02:23:44.226 --> 02:23:46.347]  So keep digging that hole, baby.
[02:23:46.347 --> 02:23:48.589]  Keep digging your hole.
[02:23:48.589 --> 02:23:53.413]  Let's now begin to go to some of these clips from the Peter Strohk testimony yesterday.
[02:23:53.413 --> 02:23:56.415]  Let's start with Trey Gowdy hitting Peter Strohk hard.
[02:23:57.475 --> 02:24:02.579]  And your testimony is, Bob Mueller did not kick you off because of the content of your text.
[02:24:02.579 --> 02:24:05.861]  He kicked you off because of some appearance that he was worried about.
[02:24:05.861 --> 02:24:11.365]  My testimony, what you asked and what I responded to was that he kicked me off because of my bias.
[02:24:11.365 --> 02:24:17.650]  I'm stating to you, it is not my understanding that he kicked me off because of any bias, that it was done based on the appearance.
[02:24:17.650 --> 02:24:23.694]  If you want to represent what you said accurately, I'm happy to answer that question, but I don't appreciate what was originally said being changed.
[02:24:24.034 --> 02:24:26.076]  I don't give a damn what you appreciate, Agent Strzok.
[02:24:26.076 --> 02:24:32.620]  I don't appreciate having an FBI agent with an unprecedented level of animus working on two major investigations during 2016.
[02:24:32.620 --> 02:24:36.623]  Yeah!
[02:24:36.623 --> 02:24:37.743]  And guess what?
[02:24:37.743 --> 02:24:42.667]  The Republicans are taking the gloves off now because they're sick of your crap!
[02:24:42.667 --> 02:24:48.050]  And the average Republican in Congress doesn't want to see this country burned to the ground!
[02:24:48.050 --> 02:24:50.092]  Which is apparently what the average Democrat wants!
[02:24:51.004 --> 02:24:52.825]  So you're getting Louie Gohmert!
[02:24:52.825 --> 02:24:54.266]  You're getting Trey Gowdy!
[02:24:54.266 --> 02:24:55.747]  You're getting Daryl Issa!
[02:24:55.747 --> 02:24:57.368]  You're getting Bob Goodlatte!
[02:24:57.368 --> 02:25:03.392]  They're all coming out of the woodworks now because they don't want to see you burn the country to the ground!
[02:25:03.392 --> 02:25:07.254]  So we need... Oh, but this is only... This is only the beginning.
[02:25:07.254 --> 02:25:10.176]  This is only the first dominoes beginning to fall.
[02:25:11.226 --> 02:25:13.007]  These people are dead.
[02:25:13.007 --> 02:25:16.528]  They are, just like President Trump said, we caught them red-handed.
[02:25:16.528 --> 02:25:21.490]  They are in a total panic mode, shoveling dirt out of their hole, thinking they're going to dig their way out of it.
[02:25:21.490 --> 02:25:23.351]  They're just getting deeper and deeper.
[02:25:23.351 --> 02:25:25.732]  Let's now go to Daryl Issa.
[02:25:25.732 --> 02:25:26.993]  This was a clever one.
[02:25:26.993 --> 02:25:29.234]  Forcing Peter Strzok to read his own text messages.
[02:25:30.600 --> 02:25:32.401]  You did a number of texts.
[02:25:32.401 --> 02:25:38.204]  All of the texts that are presented to us, as far as I know, came from your government phone, correct?
[02:25:38.204 --> 02:25:39.325]  I believe that to be the case.
[02:25:39.325 --> 02:25:43.747]  So you've made no text available from your private phone, is that correct?
[02:25:43.747 --> 02:25:44.368]  That's correct.
[02:25:44.368 --> 02:25:46.489]  Did you ever text on your private phone?
[02:25:46.489 --> 02:25:47.229]  I did.
[02:25:47.229 --> 02:25:49.871]  Did you ever text Lisa Page on your private phone?
[02:25:49.871 --> 02:25:50.751]  I did.
[02:25:50.751 --> 02:25:57.055]  Did you ever text Lisa Page on your private phone similar texts to the ones you did on your government phone?
[02:25:58.851 --> 02:25:59.951]  By similar you mean what?
[02:25:59.951 --> 02:26:05.696]  Commenting on Mr. Trump or Hillary Clinton or anything else political in nature.
[02:26:05.696 --> 02:26:08.518]  I don't specifically recall but it's probably a safe assumption that yes.
[02:26:08.518 --> 02:26:10.339]  So it's likely that they would be similar.
[02:26:10.339 --> 02:26:11.040]  Why don't we get those texts?
[02:26:11.040 --> 02:26:12.200]  Why don't we subpoena and get those texts?
[02:26:12.200 --> 02:26:17.965]  Your personal phone has likely similar texts to the ones that we found on your government phone.
[02:26:17.965 --> 02:26:18.805]  That's correct?
[02:26:18.805 --> 02:26:22.388]  I would say it has similar expressions of personal
[02:26:23.289 --> 02:26:28.996]  Okay, so in front of you I have one sheet of paper that was presented to you a few minutes ago.
[02:26:28.996 --> 02:26:34.143]  And I'm going to just go to a date and then ask you to read your own words.
[02:26:34.143 --> 02:26:34.924]  March 4, 2016.
[02:26:34.924 --> 02:26:38.528]  You want me to read this?
[02:26:38.528 --> 02:26:38.969]  Yes, please.
[02:26:38.969 --> 02:26:39.409]  Yes, sir.
[02:26:39.409 --> 02:26:40.571]  OMG, he's an idiot.
[02:26:42.131 --> 02:26:44.193]  May 4th, 2016.
[02:26:44.193 --> 02:26:46.074]  Now the pressure really starts to finish NYE.
[02:26:46.074 --> 02:26:46.254]  July 19th, 2016.
[02:26:46.254 --> 02:26:47.875]  Hi, how was Trump other than a douche?
[02:26:47.875 --> 02:26:48.335]  Melania?
[02:26:54.375 --> 02:26:57.017]  July 21st, 2016.
[02:26:57.017 --> 02:26:58.137]  Trump is a disaster.
[02:26:58.137 --> 02:27:01.799]  I have no idea how destabilizing his presidency would be.
[02:27:01.799 --> 02:27:04.000]  You're the one destabilizing the country!
[02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.402]  I don't believe I wrote this text, sir.
[02:27:06.402 --> 02:27:09.003]  Okay, it's been attributed to you, so we'll go on to the next.
[02:27:09.003 --> 02:27:10.084]  August 8th, 2016.
[02:27:10.084 --> 02:27:15.267]  And I'll preface it by saying this for context.
[02:27:15.267 --> 02:27:15.467]  Ms.
[02:27:15.467 --> 02:27:19.789]  Page said, not ever going to become president, right?
[02:27:19.789 --> 02:27:21.310]  Right?
[02:27:21.310 --> 02:27:22.190]  No, no, he's not.
[02:27:22.190 --> 02:27:22.751]  We'll stop it.
[02:27:23.604 --> 02:27:24.244]  Repeat that again.
[02:27:24.244 --> 02:27:26.325]  No, no he's not.
[02:27:26.325 --> 02:27:27.466]  We'll stop it.
[02:27:27.466 --> 02:27:27.846]  August 15, 2016.
[02:27:27.846 --> 02:27:34.289]  I want to move the path you threw out for consideration in Andy's office.
[02:27:34.289 --> 02:27:36.490]  There's no meeting in Andy McCabe's office to stop the President.
[02:27:36.490 --> 02:27:37.971]  I'm afraid we can't take that risk.
[02:27:37.971 --> 02:27:40.873]  It's like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you're 40.
[02:27:42.270 --> 02:27:43.571]  On October 20th, 2016.
[02:27:43.571 --> 02:27:50.916]  Uh, I can't pull away what the, and I defer to the chairman whether or not... You can just use one letter if you don't mind.
[02:27:50.916 --> 02:27:54.438]  Why the F, what the F happened to our country, Lise?
[02:27:54.438 --> 02:27:55.739]  Okay, read it again that way.
[02:27:55.739 --> 02:27:56.319]  Lise?
[02:27:56.319 --> 02:27:58.641]  Sir, did you not, was it not intelligible?
[02:27:58.641 --> 02:27:59.661]  I just wanted to hear it one more time.
[02:27:59.661 --> 02:28:00.302]  Lise, I love you, Lise.
[02:28:00.302 --> 02:28:01.503]  We're gonna stop the president together, Lise.
[02:28:01.503 --> 02:28:01.723]  Okay, sir.
[02:28:01.723 --> 02:28:02.843]  Sure, happy to indulge you.
[02:28:02.843 --> 02:28:04.144]  Ride on my magic carpet, Lise.
[02:28:04.144 --> 02:28:06.626]  I can't pull away what the F happened to our country, Lise.
[02:28:07.086 --> 02:28:07.926]  Oh, Lise.
[02:28:07.926 --> 02:28:08.947]  Oh, Lise.
[02:28:08.947 --> 02:28:10.147]  We're in the FBI together.
[02:28:10.147 --> 02:28:11.188]  We're going to stop this country.
[02:28:11.188 --> 02:28:28.394]  Why in the world do you believe that this committee should not ask for the record of similar text from your private account to find out what else you might have said about insurance policies or about the President of the United States or an investigation?
[02:28:28.394 --> 02:28:31.655]  That is a rhetorical question you need not answer and I yield back.
[02:28:31.655 --> 02:28:35.297]  And we're going to get those best messages, Peter Stroke, and let me tell you something else.
[02:28:36.809 --> 02:28:41.015]  Daryl Issa is the perfect example of a Republican taking the gloves off.
[02:28:41.015 --> 02:28:47.223]  Just four years ago, he shut down the Lois Lerner hearing because he was a cucked Republican.
[02:28:47.223 --> 02:28:49.847]  Now he's out here standing up for truth and justice.
[02:28:49.847 --> 02:28:53.252]  We need more people to come out of the Republican Party that have some gonads.
[02:28:55.270 --> 02:28:59.493]  Now there's a proven powerful anti-inflammatory that absorbs 40 times better.
[02:28:59.493 --> 02:29:07.639]  Yes, Nano Curcumin Plus from One Planet Nutrition contains smaller particle size that allows absorption over 40 times better into your bloodstream.

[02:31:48.183 --> 02:31:50.325]  Something the globalists are targeting.

[02:31:56.178 --> 02:31:58.120]  This 4th of July is special.
[02:31:58.120 --> 02:32:00.122]  Everybody can see it, they can feel it.
[02:32:00.122 --> 02:32:04.566]  The globalists are attempting to kill a worldwide awakening to their tyranny.
[02:32:04.566 --> 02:32:08.930]  And America, yet again, is at the heart of the resistance of the globalists.
[02:32:08.930 --> 02:32:14.035]  That's why this 4th of July I'm asking all of our great supporters to think about Infowars now more than ever.
[02:32:14.035 --> 02:32:17.778]  And what would the world be like if Infowars wasn't there resisting the globalists?
[02:32:18.619 --> 02:32:20.901]  What would have happened if you hadn't supported InfoWars?
[02:32:20.901 --> 02:32:22.843]  We would not be having the victories we have today.
[02:32:22.843 --> 02:32:26.006]  So yes, a lot of good things are happening, but the enemy is striking back.
[02:32:26.006 --> 02:32:33.152]  So please, think about InfoWars and funding our operation while you get great products at the same time on this 4th of July that's so historic.
[02:32:33.152 --> 02:32:35.013]  We have record sales going on right now.

[02:32:54.369 --> 02:32:59.173]  InfoWareStore.com.
[02:32:59.173 --> 02:33:01.835]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:15.212 --> 02:33:22.301]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:22.301 --> 02:33:25.565]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:33:38.297 --> 02:33:43.004]  Well, you thought you could stop President Trump from getting elected.
[02:33:43.004 --> 02:33:46.730]  You had all your operatives in the media activated.
[02:33:46.730 --> 02:33:52.739]  You had all your operatives inside the Republican and the Democrat Party engaged.
[02:33:53.834 --> 02:33:57.597]  You had your street minions out there trying to intimidate and bully people.
[02:33:57.597 --> 02:34:04.423]  You had your deep state agents trying to run operations to stop him, spying on President Trump.
[02:34:04.423 --> 02:34:05.704]  And guess what?
[02:34:05.704 --> 02:34:07.646]  You still lost.
[02:34:07.646 --> 02:34:12.850]  You cheated in about five or six different ways, and you still lost.
[02:34:12.850 --> 02:34:16.833]  You need to get the message, God is in control.
[02:34:16.833 --> 02:34:20.897]  And if you want to try to keep fighting God's plan, you're going to end up a part of it.
[02:34:21.906 --> 02:34:23.406]  And that's already what's going on.
[02:34:23.406 --> 02:34:31.629]  Now, let's go back to these highlights from Peter Stroke's testimony on the Hill yesterday.
[02:34:31.629 --> 02:34:32.489]  Let's go to clip 9.
[02:34:32.489 --> 02:34:33.490]  This is Bob Goodlatte.
[02:34:33.490 --> 02:34:38.631]  Again, another example of a Republican who you would never hear talk like this before.
[02:34:38.631 --> 02:34:40.112]  They're sick and tired of it.
[02:34:40.112 --> 02:34:41.592]  They're taking the gloves off.
[02:34:41.592 --> 02:34:45.113]  They're getting engaged as patriots for truth and justice.
[02:34:45.113 --> 02:34:47.874]  Let's go to Bob Goodlatte questioning Peter Stroke.
[02:34:48.592 --> 02:34:55.461]  Do you recognize how your vitriol against President Trump makes it appear you could never approach the case in a fair-minded manner?
[02:35:05.686 --> 02:35:07.486]  Sir, of course I appreciate that.
[02:35:07.486 --> 02:35:08.107]  I understand.
[02:35:08.107 --> 02:35:10.207]  Let's be clear.
[02:35:10.207 --> 02:35:11.547]  Let's be clear.
[02:35:11.547 --> 02:35:18.189]  They said in the text that we've received, we haven't even seen most of them, that they would do anything to stop him.
[02:35:18.189 --> 02:35:19.429]  We will stop him.
[02:35:19.429 --> 02:35:25.330]  And he's trying to tell us to believe that he's going to be neutral.
[02:35:25.330 --> 02:35:28.211]  Dude, we are not stupid.
[02:35:28.211 --> 02:35:29.731]  Let's go back.
[02:35:32.817 --> 02:35:34.380]  On August 26, 2016, you texted Ms.
[02:35:34.380 --> 02:35:34.901]  Page, quote,
[02:35:39.864 --> 02:35:42.907]  To a Southern Virginia Walmart.
[02:35:42.907 --> 02:35:45.749]  I could smell the Trump support.
[02:35:45.749 --> 02:35:48.952]  And smell is in capital letters.
[02:35:48.952 --> 02:35:50.514]  All capital letters.
[02:35:50.514 --> 02:35:53.897]  What does Trump support smell like, Mr. Strzok?
[02:35:53.897 --> 02:35:55.678]  Sir, that's an expression of speech.
[02:35:55.678 --> 02:35:57.960]  I clearly wasn't smelling one thing or the other.
[02:35:57.960 --> 02:36:00.843]  What I was commenting on is living in Northern Virginia.
[02:36:00.843 --> 02:36:03.325]  What does that mean?
[02:36:03.325 --> 02:36:06.228]  What I meant by that was living in Northern Virginia.
[02:36:06.488 --> 02:36:16.810]  Having traveled 100 and 150 miles south within the same state, I was struck by the extraordinary difference in the expression of political opinion and belief amongst the community there.
[02:36:16.810 --> 02:36:19.911]  And you described that as smell in capital letters?
[02:36:19.911 --> 02:36:22.611]  Sir, that was a quick choice of words in Italian.
[02:36:22.611 --> 02:36:25.192]  All right, so earlier... Scene or word?
[02:36:25.192 --> 02:36:27.572]  Okay, so earlier you had texted Ms.
[02:36:27.572 --> 02:36:35.114]  Page that another part of Virginia, Loudoun County, which is I think in northern Virginia,
[02:36:36.278 --> 02:36:40.881]  Is, quote, still ignorant hillbillies, end quote.
[02:36:40.881 --> 02:36:41.942]  Is that what you meant?
[02:36:41.942 --> 02:36:43.023]  No, sir, not at all.
[02:36:43.023 --> 02:36:45.845]  That you consider Trump supporters to be ignorant hillbillies?
[02:36:45.845 --> 02:36:46.485]  Not at all, sir.
[02:36:46.485 --> 02:36:47.626]  What did you mean by that?
[02:36:47.626 --> 02:36:54.431]  Well, sir, the first thing I'd tell you is as a proud Fairfax County resident, there's a healthy sort of competition between Fairfax and Loudoun.
[02:36:54.431 --> 02:37:05.078]  Second thing I would tell you is that in no way did I or do I believe any resident of Loudoun County or southern Virginia or anywhere else in the nation is
[02:37:06.199 --> 02:37:06.800]  Are.
[02:37:06.800 --> 02:37:08.181]  Any of those things.
[02:37:08.181 --> 02:37:11.223]  That was a... Don't you know I was just flirting with my boo?
[02:37:11.223 --> 02:37:14.806]  Do you understand the implications of this text when my constituents in Virginia read it?
[02:37:14.806 --> 02:37:16.587]  Me and Lise like to flirt over the phone.
[02:37:16.587 --> 02:37:17.287]  That's my boo!
[02:37:17.287 --> 02:37:17.928]  I do, sir.
[02:37:17.928 --> 02:37:29.196]  And I would ask you to tell them that that was a, in some cases certainly unfortunate, use of words that in no way do I believe that those things are... Hey, you're a total jackass working at the FBI.
[02:37:30.239 --> 02:37:31.600]  That's what it proves.
[02:37:31.600 --> 02:37:41.405]  If it doesn't prove your bias, which, I mean, you know, okay, you want to deny your bias, wow, whew, yeah, I don't need air to breathe either.
[02:37:41.405 --> 02:37:43.526]  But that's fine, deny your bias even though it's obvious.
[02:37:43.526 --> 02:37:49.410]  Okay, so you're not biased, so you're just a jackass at the highest levels of the FBI.
[02:37:49.410 --> 02:37:54.653]  So that's just as revealing as whatever bias you may or may not have had that you're trying to deny.
[02:37:55.322 --> 02:37:58.545]  Ooh, I'm just flirting with my boo, Lise.
[02:37:58.545 --> 02:38:01.227]  I don't mean anything about Trump supporters smelling bad.
[02:38:01.227 --> 02:38:04.390]  I don't mean anything about stopping President Trump.
[02:38:04.390 --> 02:38:07.633]  I don't mean anything when I call him an effing D-bag.
[02:38:07.633 --> 02:38:09.534]  No, I'm just flirting with my boo, Lise.
[02:38:09.534 --> 02:38:10.595]  Come on, now.
[02:38:10.595 --> 02:38:11.036]  It's my boo!
[02:38:13.186 --> 02:38:25.650]  You know what, let's actually go to clip 18, where Louie Gohmert, again, another Republican, puffing up the chest now, standing up for America, getting some wind behind their wings.
[02:38:25.650 --> 02:38:29.412]  Listen to how Gohmert approaches Leece and the Boo.
[02:38:31.288 --> 02:38:32.449]  Stop it.
[02:38:32.449 --> 02:38:32.709]  Stop it.
[02:38:32.709 --> 02:38:33.869]  I can't handle it.
[02:38:33.869 --> 02:38:35.710]  I want you to restart it.
[02:38:35.710 --> 02:38:37.251]  I want you to restart it.
[02:38:37.251 --> 02:38:38.652]  So this is what's happening here.
[02:38:54.631 --> 02:38:59.755]  Louie Gohmert calls out Peter Stroke for cheating on his wife with his boo, Lise.
[02:38:59.755 --> 02:39:03.178]  Also an FBI agent on the Mueller team.
[02:39:03.178 --> 02:39:17.930]  Now, the Democrat party that claims to be the party for women, claims to be the party that stands up for women, claims to be the party that wants to stop the mental and physical abuse of women, and now here they are, standing up for Peter Stroke, who cheats on his wife.
[02:39:18.630 --> 02:39:25.432]  Here they are trying to stop Louie Gohmert from calling out this man that is mentally abusing his wife by cheating on her.
[02:39:25.432 --> 02:39:29.693]  Again, listen to the Democrats who claim to be the party of standing up for women.
[02:39:29.693 --> 02:39:34.295]  Listen to them shout down Gohmert as he calls out Peter Stroke for cheating on his wife.
[02:39:35.293 --> 02:39:41.660]  How many times did you look so innocent into your wife's eye and lie to her about Lisa?
[02:39:41.660 --> 02:39:42.941]  Mr. Chairman, this is outrageous!
[02:39:42.941 --> 02:39:44.483]  You need your medication!
[02:39:57.397 --> 02:39:59.419]  No, roll it one more time.
[02:39:59.419 --> 02:40:00.780]  This is too good.
[02:40:00.780 --> 02:40:02.962]  This is, I mean, this is classic.
[02:40:02.962 --> 02:40:04.804]  This is, roll it one more time.
[02:40:04.804 --> 02:40:05.425]  This is too good.
[02:40:05.425 --> 02:40:06.266]  Let me hear it again.
[02:40:06.266 --> 02:40:13.312]  How many times did you look so innocent into your wife's eye and lied to her about Lisa?
[02:40:13.312 --> 02:40:14.714]  Mr. Chairman, this is outrageous.
[02:40:14.974 --> 02:40:15.314]  Who is that?
[02:40:15.314 --> 02:40:17.175]  You need your medication, Mr. Chairman.
[02:40:17.175 --> 02:40:19.217]  The humanity, this is outrageous.
[02:40:19.217 --> 02:40:19.617]  My God.
[02:40:43.131 --> 02:40:43.651]  Woo!
[02:40:43.651 --> 02:40:46.593]  Are we having fun or what?
[02:40:46.593 --> 02:40:52.995]  Let's go to Trey Gowdy again blasting Peter Strzok.
[02:40:52.995 --> 02:40:54.896]  I did not know what existed.
[02:40:54.896 --> 02:40:56.817]  I had prejudged nothing.
[02:40:56.817 --> 02:40:58.318]  That was all to be determined.
[02:40:59.634 --> 02:41:16.824]  And that is a logical way for investigators, attorneys, and... Starting with the political death penalty and impeachment is not the logical way a neutral dispassionate... You know, point of order... Mr. Chairman, we're demanding equal time... You're not going to have to file a search warrant, Mr. Chairman.
[02:41:16.824 --> 02:41:22.527]  And if you can't control yourself, how do you expect this committee to control itself?
[02:41:22.527 --> 02:41:25.569]  You've been out of control since you've been on this committee.
[02:41:25.569 --> 02:41:27.290]  Why don't you leave it alone?
[02:41:27.290 --> 02:41:28.290]  This is not Benghazi.
[02:41:28.290 --> 02:41:29.191]  Who is this dingbat?
[02:41:30.526 --> 02:41:33.188]  Somebody find me the name of that dingbat.
[02:41:33.188 --> 02:41:40.774]  I need to make sure that she's in the hashtag midturbmadness poll that we're running at InfoWars.com right now on the Alex Jones Twitter.
[02:41:40.774 --> 02:41:42.095]  In fact, let's go ahead and give that a plug.
[02:41:43.004 --> 02:41:45.326]  We are currently running a poll.
[02:41:45.326 --> 02:41:47.627]  It's hashtag midterm madness.
[02:41:47.627 --> 02:41:50.670]  It's a pool of 64 members of Congress.
[02:41:50.670 --> 02:41:53.852]  And we're going to boil it down to find out who is the worst.
[02:41:53.852 --> 02:41:54.833]  Round one is complete.
[02:41:54.833 --> 02:41:57.615]  Maxine Waters wins by a landslide.
[02:41:57.615 --> 02:42:00.517]  Right now, round two, Chuck Schumer's winning by a landslide.
[02:42:00.517 --> 02:42:04.379]  Who is that nut?
[02:42:04.379 --> 02:42:05.240]  Bonnie Coleman.
[02:42:05.240 --> 02:42:06.301]  Oh, she's on the list.
[02:42:07.819 --> 02:42:11.322]  Uh, you can't sneak by me.
[02:42:11.322 --> 02:42:14.064]  I see everything.
[02:42:14.064 --> 02:42:15.545]  Where is your medication?
[02:42:15.545 --> 02:42:16.986]  This is outrageous!
[02:42:16.986 --> 02:42:20.989]  All the humanity!
[02:42:20.989 --> 02:42:22.470]  Oh my gosh.
[02:42:22.470 --> 02:42:23.111]  What's going on here?
[02:42:23.111 --> 02:42:26.093]  I'm getting some weird, conflicting message on the screen.
[02:42:26.093 --> 02:42:28.515]  Alright, you know what?
[02:42:28.515 --> 02:42:30.637]  It's all outrageous.
[02:42:30.637 --> 02:42:32.738]  Give me a little dot-cam right here, can we?
[02:42:32.738 --> 02:42:33.299]  Peter Stroke.
[02:42:34.386 --> 02:42:36.627]  Here's the story, folks.
[02:42:36.627 --> 02:42:40.828]  The deep state is in absolute panic.
[02:42:40.828 --> 02:42:44.770]  The Democrat Party is in absolute panic.
[02:42:44.770 --> 02:42:50.612]  Donald Trump and his constituency is having ultimate victory.
[02:42:50.612 --> 02:42:55.334]  And the craziness of the left is showing itself.
[02:42:55.334 --> 02:42:57.675]  Infowars Life is launching its newest product.
[02:42:57.675 --> 02:42:59.836]  We're really, really proud of it.

[02:43:44.636 --> 02:43:46.658]  It sold out for another month and a half.
[02:43:46.658 --> 02:43:49.981]  We sold it at 50% off till it sold out.
[02:43:49.981 --> 02:43:52.503]  And I think it's gonna be the same way with this fiber.

[02:44:15.632 --> 02:44:26.722]  Prebiotic fiber is soluble fiber that ferments in the gut to help feed good bacteria, which helps you digest food, absorb nutrients, and even support your immune system.

[02:44:34.088 --> 02:44:48.733]  Cheap prebiotic fibers are used up only at the beginning of the colon, but our premium organic acacia fiber is slowly digested by the good bacteria throughout the entire colon for maximum prebiotic effect.
[02:44:48.733 --> 02:44:51.394]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:45:00.146 --> 02:45:05.889]  Years ago, InfoWarsLife created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[02:45:05.889 --> 02:45:13.754]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[02:45:13.754 --> 02:45:16.916]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[02:45:17.096 --> 02:45:22.381]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.
[02:45:22.381 --> 02:45:25.144]  There's no better product to help your body fight back.
[02:45:25.144 --> 02:45:34.112]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive tract, and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[02:45:34.192 --> 02:45:39.036]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from InfoWars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[02:46:03.496 --> 02:46:07.277]  It's you that has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[02:46:07.277 --> 02:46:16.019]  It is you, the info warriors across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[02:46:16.019 --> 02:46:20.580]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[02:46:20.580 --> 02:46:22.020]  You are the info war.
[02:46:22.020 --> 02:46:25.561]  And now, because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[02:46:26.241 --> 02:46:37.624]  That everyone go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[02:46:37.624 --> 02:46:45.586]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the Infowars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[02:46:45.586 --> 02:46:52.628]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at Infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:46:52.628 --> 02:46:55.389]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[02:46:58.709 --> 02:47:06.752]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:06.752 --> 02:47:07.652]  That's right.
[02:47:27.825 --> 02:47:35.914]  Leave this playing in the background while I read these headlines.
[02:47:35.914 --> 02:47:39.378]  CNN, I actually wanted the CNN story.
[02:47:39.378 --> 02:47:41.100]  I forget, what was the CNN headline?
[02:47:42.574 --> 02:47:45.958]  Well, regardless, CNN runs multiple stories.
[02:47:45.958 --> 02:47:48.621]  They're trying to lobby to shut down InfoWars.
[02:47:48.621 --> 02:47:51.405]  They cannot get us kicked off YouTube.
[02:47:51.405 --> 02:47:55.149]  They cannot get enough strikes against us to have us shut down.
[02:47:55.149 --> 02:47:57.772]  CNN trying to shut down InfoWars.
[02:47:58.433 --> 02:48:01.734]  Yahoo, fighting fake news with the law.
[02:48:01.734 --> 02:48:03.155]  Who do you think they're talking about?
[02:48:03.155 --> 02:48:04.215]  They can't beat us.
[02:48:04.215 --> 02:48:06.556]  They try to call us fake news and demonize us.
[02:48:06.556 --> 02:48:09.336]  We keep having victories and getting bigger.
[02:48:09.336 --> 02:48:12.177]  AFP, the online battle for truth.
[02:48:12.177 --> 02:48:13.718]  Who is the number one
[02:48:14.458 --> 02:48:17.100]  Online news organization, if it's not InfoWars.
[02:48:17.100 --> 02:48:20.363]  Oh, it is InfoWars, unless you're talking Drudge Report.
[02:48:20.363 --> 02:48:22.384]  The online battle for truth.
[02:48:22.384 --> 02:48:27.208]  That's right, they keep losing, InfoWars keeps winning.
[02:48:27.208 --> 02:48:28.089]  CNET.
[02:48:28.089 --> 02:48:31.712]  Facebook's InfoWars problem just won't go away.
[02:48:31.712 --> 02:48:36.736]  That's right, because we are the champions, and we're going to keep fighting till the end.
[02:48:36.736 --> 02:48:39.218]  And so is our audience, because they're champions too.
[02:48:40.856 --> 02:48:47.319]  From Vanity Fair, how Facebook's InfoWars crisis exposes Mark Zuckerberg's hypocrisy.
[02:48:47.319 --> 02:48:50.840]  That's right, Zuckerberg won't shut InfoWars down.
[02:48:50.840 --> 02:48:52.040]  Why not?
[02:48:52.040 --> 02:48:54.921]  Because we are the champions.
[02:48:54.921 --> 02:49:00.924]  And then from The Guardian, Hillary Clinton attacks Trump for all-out war on truth, facts, and reason.
[02:49:01.823 --> 02:49:06.544]  That's because Donald Trump and the White House listens to InfoWars.
[02:49:06.544 --> 02:49:09.305]  That's because Donald Trump came on InfoWars.
[02:49:09.305 --> 02:49:12.506]  And that's because InfoWars defeated Hillary Clinton.
[02:49:12.506 --> 02:49:14.747]  So jack up, the Queen!
[02:49:14.747 --> 02:49:16.647]  Jack up, we are the champions!
[02:49:16.647 --> 02:49:18.348]  Because we are the champions!
[02:49:18.348 --> 02:49:19.908]  The red wave is coming!
[02:49:19.908 --> 02:49:21.749]  The deep state has been exposed!
[02:49:21.749 --> 02:49:24.309]  American patriots are alive and activated!
[02:49:24.309 --> 02:49:26.570]  And you're going down, Rod Rosenstein!
[02:49:26.570 --> 02:49:28.350]  You're going down, Robert Mueller!
[02:49:28.350 --> 02:49:30.351]  So try to pull all your dirty tricks!
[02:49:30.831 --> 02:49:35.694]  But President Trump has outsmarted you and has all the aces up his sleeve.
[02:49:35.694 --> 02:49:37.575]  So go ahead and keep digging that hole.
[02:49:37.575 --> 02:49:39.356]  You could have walked away.
[02:49:39.356 --> 02:49:41.377]  You could have sailed off into the sunset.
[02:49:41.377 --> 02:49:49.282]  But you just had to try to stab America in the back one last time and bleed us out, didn't you?
[02:49:49.282 --> 02:49:56.126]  And President Trump comes in and sauters our wounds and stitches us up together and has us walking again.
[02:49:56.126 --> 02:49:59.328]  And you want to come and try to kneecap us, but we're too strong now.
[02:50:00.342 --> 02:50:05.646]  And there's nothing you can do as a viral photo is now hitting the web.
[02:50:05.646 --> 02:50:10.209]  President Trump sits in Winston Churchill's chair.
[02:50:10.209 --> 02:50:12.030]  Oh boy.
[02:50:12.030 --> 02:50:14.652]  Let the trolling begin.
[02:50:14.652 --> 02:50:17.514]  Let the viral sensation begin.
[02:50:17.514 --> 02:50:24.239]  Let the power of the force fill Donald Trump to defeat the deep state!
[02:50:24.239 --> 02:50:26.961]  Ah, they continue to show themselves, don't they?
[02:50:29.190 --> 02:50:34.135]  What a glorious time to be alive.
[02:50:34.135 --> 02:50:40.181]  Well, I'll tell you what, let's finish up here with some of these video clips.
[02:50:40.181 --> 02:50:48.330]  Let's go to classic Donald Trump here, calling out the Sun story as fake news and threatening them with the tapes to prove it.
[02:50:49.889 --> 02:50:51.869]  I didn't criticize the Prime Minister.
[02:50:51.869 --> 02:50:54.170]  I have a lot of respect for the Prime Minister.
[02:50:54.170 --> 02:51:02.952]  And unfortunately, there was a story that was done, which was generally fine, but it didn't put in what I said about the Prime Minister.
[02:51:02.952 --> 02:51:05.113]  And I said tremendous things.
[02:51:05.113 --> 02:51:11.354]  And fortunately, we tend to record stories now, so we have it for your enjoyment if you'd like it.
[02:51:11.354 --> 02:51:13.375]  But we record when we deal with reporters.
[02:51:13.375 --> 02:51:15.195]  It's called fake news.
[02:51:15.195 --> 02:51:19.296]  And we solve a lot of problems with the good old recording instrument.
[02:51:20.785 --> 02:51:27.646]  Trump has trumped him again, just like he trumped Comey.
[02:51:27.646 --> 02:51:29.166]  He records everything.
[02:51:29.166 --> 02:51:32.247]  Oh, it's so glorious.
[02:51:32.247 --> 02:51:35.287]  Now, let's go to classic Trump again.
[02:51:35.287 --> 02:51:37.548]  This one I might have to play over and over again.
[02:51:37.548 --> 02:51:40.728]  Just shutting down Jim Acosta and CNN.
[02:51:40.728 --> 02:51:46.209]  Mr. President, since you attacked CNN, can I ask you a question?
[02:51:46.209 --> 02:51:47.189]  John Roberts, go ahead, John.
[02:51:47.189 --> 02:51:48.010]  Can I ask you a question?
[02:51:48.010 --> 02:51:49.030]  No, no.
[02:51:49.030 --> 02:51:50.030]  John Roberts, go ahead.
[02:51:51.013 --> 02:51:54.736]  CNN is fake news, I don't take questions from CNN.
[02:51:54.736 --> 02:51:57.339]  CNN is fake news, I don't take questions from CNN.
[02:51:57.339 --> 02:51:59.440]  John Roberts of Fox.
[02:51:59.440 --> 02:52:01.182]  Let's go to a real network.
[02:52:01.182 --> 02:52:03.144]  Well, we're a real network too, sir.
[02:52:03.144 --> 02:52:09.429]  Thank you, Mr. President.
[02:52:09.429 --> 02:52:11.811]  Does Jim Acosta wear Depends?
[02:52:11.811 --> 02:52:14.834]  Because he is quite a baby.
[02:52:16.288 --> 02:52:18.109]  I mean, seriously, you know what?
[02:52:18.109 --> 02:52:23.891]  Has anyone put together a compilation of all the Jim Acosta moments?
[02:52:23.891 --> 02:52:27.812]  I mean, I'm sitting here trying to reflect on all the different Jim Acosta moments.
[02:52:27.812 --> 02:52:30.493]  I mean, there's dozens of them.
[02:52:30.493 --> 02:52:34.634]  I think Trump has called Jim Acosta fake news six times.
[02:52:34.634 --> 02:52:41.297]  Jim Acosta has stood at the back of a loud crowd and pretended to ask Trump a question, and then turns around like, see, he's ignoring me.
[02:52:42.466 --> 02:52:44.888]  Another one, he gets trolled by Laura Loomer.
[02:52:44.888 --> 02:52:52.673]  I mean, seriously, if anybody hasn't put a compilation together of all of the classic Jim Acosta moments, that needs to get done.
[02:52:52.673 --> 02:52:55.535]  Because this guy, what a loser!
[02:52:55.535 --> 02:52:58.418]  I mean, I give him credit.
[02:52:58.418 --> 02:53:00.459]  At least he, I mean, he commits to his job.
[02:53:00.459 --> 02:53:03.982]  He's basically the punching bag for CNN.
[02:53:03.982 --> 02:53:06.824]  He's now the face of fake news.
[02:53:06.824 --> 02:53:11.307]  Jim Acosta is now the punching bag and the face for fake news at CNN.
[02:53:14.761 --> 02:53:19.826]  And I hope President Trump just gets worse with Jim Acosta.
[02:53:19.826 --> 02:53:23.830]  I hope President Trump continues to lambast Jim Acosta.
[02:53:23.830 --> 02:53:26.673]  It's so entertaining!
[02:53:26.673 --> 02:53:29.615]  It's so glorious!
[02:53:29.615 --> 02:53:32.919]  Oh, and it's just so refreshing to have a president call it like it is.
[02:53:33.902 --> 02:53:37.763]  The corporate fake news media, CNN.
[02:53:37.763 --> 02:53:40.143]  We are not the enemy of the American people.
[02:53:40.143 --> 02:53:42.384]  We love the American people.
[02:53:42.384 --> 02:53:48.065]  By the way, the American people are racists, bigots, misogynists, and terrorists, and hate mongers.
[02:53:48.065 --> 02:53:50.606]  We love the American people.
[02:53:50.606 --> 02:53:54.567]  This is CNN.
[02:53:54.567 --> 02:53:55.967]  Fake news, Jim Acosta.
[02:53:55.967 --> 02:53:58.967]  Just classic stuff.
[02:53:58.967 --> 02:53:59.548]  Oh, you know what?
[02:53:59.548 --> 02:54:00.928]  Maybe we will just roll
[02:54:02.130 --> 02:54:06.933]  This compilation on the other side in the short segment, a compilation of all the fake news CNN.
[02:54:06.933 --> 02:54:13.756]  So it's not, I don't think it's a Jim Acosta compilation, it's just all the CNN fake news compilation.
[02:54:13.756 --> 02:54:16.218]  Really incredible.
[02:54:16.218 --> 02:54:23.722]  So Joel Gilbert is going to take over after the first five minutes in the next segment.
[02:54:23.722 --> 02:54:31.646]  I will pass the baton to Joel Gilbert and he will host the fourth hour here.
[02:54:33.959 --> 02:54:43.202]  But let's just refresh in case we have any new audience members here.
[02:54:43.202 --> 02:54:47.243]  You have the Trump protest in London totally fail.
[02:54:47.243 --> 02:54:51.805]  You have President Trump stand up to NATO and win.
[02:54:51.805 --> 02:54:56.266]  You have President Trump stand up to the UK and win.
[02:54:56.266 --> 02:55:01.028]  You have President Trump stand up against the fake news and win.
[02:55:03.297 --> 02:55:17.942]  You have Rod Rosenstein, though, because of all the winning, with Robert Mueller, have a publicity stunt press conference today, claiming new indictments on Russians, saying they attempted to hack the U.S.
[02:55:17.942 --> 02:55:25.885]  election and indeed hacked the DNC and the DCCC, even though the DNC and the DCCC never turned over their servers to be investigated.
[02:55:25.885 --> 02:55:27.685]  So how did that reach that conclusion?
[02:55:27.685 --> 02:55:32.307]  Just wait till the Russians show up in court and demand discovery, and Robert Mueller walks away again.
[02:55:33.277 --> 02:55:35.979]  Just like the first time.
[02:55:35.979 --> 02:55:37.861]  But it doesn't matter.
[02:55:37.861 --> 02:55:47.068]  The whole reason for these indictments to be brought up today is to sabotage the Trump-Putin summit.
[02:55:47.068 --> 02:55:49.190]  That's all this is.
[02:55:49.190 --> 02:55:53.473]  They don't want good faith negotiations between Trump and Putin.
[02:55:53.473 --> 02:55:57.857]  They don't even want Trump and Putin to be able to sit down cordially and have a conversation.
[02:55:57.857 --> 02:55:59.318]  So they're doing everything they can
[02:56:00.936 --> 02:56:11.349]  To try and throw a wedge in between Trump and Putin and force Trump to go to Russia and scold them for whatever they did in the election.
[02:56:11.349 --> 02:56:14.152]  It's not gonna happen.
[02:56:14.152 --> 02:56:15.474]  Not going to happen.
[02:56:18.806 --> 02:56:22.069]  And, again though, they don't care.
[02:56:22.069 --> 02:56:28.413]  It's all about propaganda and putting it out there for their minions to eat.
[02:56:28.413 --> 02:56:30.095]  Their minions are starving.
[02:56:30.095 --> 02:56:32.536]  Their minions are starving for anything.
[02:56:32.536 --> 02:56:34.078]  They have nothing!
[02:56:34.078 --> 02:56:35.679]  They have nothing!
[02:56:35.679 --> 02:56:37.860]  They can't stop the Supreme Court nomination.
[02:56:37.860 --> 02:56:39.902]  They can't stop America from having a border.
[02:56:39.902 --> 02:56:41.403]  They can't abolish ICE.
[02:56:41.403 --> 02:56:44.065]  They can't get their illegals to vote.
[02:56:44.065 --> 02:56:46.347]  They keep losing and losing and losing!
[02:56:47.526 --> 02:56:57.032]  And so Robert Mueller, like a cult leader, throws the dogs a bone, the rabid dogs, throws them a bone and says, here's some Russian indictments.
[02:56:57.032 --> 02:56:59.153]  And they're going to get all frothy at the mouth.
[02:56:59.153 --> 02:57:01.095]  Oh, I can just hear Rachel Maddow.
[02:57:02.430 --> 02:57:08.873]  Oh boy, CNN and MSNBC are going to have a heyday over these indictments, just like they did the first time.
[02:57:08.873 --> 02:57:19.097]  And then, guaranteed, just like the first time, the Russians will have representation in court, demand discovery, and Robert Mueller will balk.
[02:57:19.097 --> 02:57:21.558]  Because it's not a real indictment.
[02:57:21.558 --> 02:57:24.199]  It's not a real investigation.
[02:57:24.199 --> 02:57:25.220]  It's fake.
[02:57:25.220 --> 02:57:26.380]  It's a witch hunt.
[02:57:26.380 --> 02:57:27.721]  It's a publicity stunt.
[02:57:27.721 --> 02:57:30.382]  They are trying to destroy the fabric of this nation!
[02:57:31.966 --> 02:57:34.833]  They're trying to sabotage President Trump!
[02:57:34.833 --> 02:57:36.437]  It will not be done!
[02:57:36.437 --> 02:57:38.442]  We, the people, control the nation!
[02:57:38.442 --> 02:57:39.886]  Not you, Robert Mueller!
[02:57:39.886 --> 02:57:41.229]  Not you, Robert Rosenstein!
[02:57:45.109 --> 02:57:49.251]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[02:57:49.251 --> 02:57:56.294]  InfoWars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower, and sink in your home.

[02:58:51.950 --> 02:58:52.830]  It'd take hours.
[02:58:52.830 --> 02:58:55.272]  Michael's ZX Plus now has a lower price.
[02:58:55.272 --> 02:58:56.433]  It's stronger.
[02:58:56.433 --> 02:58:58.055]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[02:58:58.055 --> 02:59:01.277]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[02:59:01.277 --> 02:59:02.398]  It's back in stock.

[02:59:09.304 --> 02:59:09.464]  I think?
[02:59:28.081 --> 02:59:30.062]  High quality silver and a lot more.
[02:59:30.062 --> 02:59:31.463]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[02:59:31.463 --> 02:59:41.389]  So thank you all for remembering InfoWareStore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake and it's so essential to spread the word.
[02:59:41.389 --> 02:59:49.674]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[02:59:49.674 --> 02:59:52.335]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:59.221 --> 03:00:06.625]  Alright, we have the compilation of CNN being totally fake news.
[03:00:06.625 --> 03:00:15.170]  Let's go and enjoy the absolute madness and nonsense that is fake news CNN.
[03:00:15.170 --> 03:00:16.651]  I want to see an honest press.
[03:00:16.651 --> 03:00:21.674]  When I started off today by saying that it's so important to the public to get an honest press.
[03:00:21.674 --> 03:00:24.396]  The press, the public doesn't believe you people anymore.
[03:00:29.926 --> 03:00:30.166]  Go ahead.
[03:00:30.166 --> 03:00:30.346]  Go ahead.
[03:00:30.346 --> 03:00:30.526]  Go ahead.
[03:00:30.526 --> 03:00:30.766]  No, not you.
[03:00:30.766 --> 03:00:31.006]  Not you.
[03:00:31.006 --> 03:00:32.087]  Your organization is terrible.
[03:00:32.087 --> 03:00:33.607]  Your organization is terrible.
[03:00:33.607 --> 03:00:33.868]  Let's go.
[03:00:33.868 --> 03:00:34.108]  Go ahead.
[03:00:34.108 --> 03:00:34.248]  Quiet.
[03:00:34.248 --> 03:00:34.628]  Quiet.
[03:00:34.628 --> 03:00:34.868]  Go ahead.
[03:00:34.868 --> 03:00:35.828]  She's asking a question.
[03:00:35.828 --> 03:00:36.229]  Don't be rude.
[03:00:36.229 --> 03:00:36.749]  Don't be rude.
[03:00:36.749 --> 03:00:37.489]  Don't be rude.
[03:00:37.489 --> 03:00:39.610]  No, I'm not going to give you a question.
[03:00:39.610 --> 03:00:41.771]  I'm not going to give you a question.
[03:00:41.771 --> 03:00:42.611]  You are fake news.
[03:01:00.638 --> 03:01:00.719]  CBS!
[03:01:00.719 --> 03:01:00.899]  CBS!
[03:01:00.899 --> 03:01:01.080]  CBS!
[03:01:10.037 --> 03:01:11.278]  The public gets it, you know.
[03:01:11.278 --> 03:01:14.159]  Look, when I go to rallies, they turn around, they start screaming at CNN.
[03:01:14.159 --> 03:01:16.160]  They want to throw their placards at CNN, you know.
[03:01:16.160 --> 03:01:26.726]  The America's closest allies were frustrated with you and angry with you, and that you were angry with them, and that you were leaving here early to go meet for more friendlier talks with Kim Jong-un in Singapore.
[03:01:26.726 --> 03:01:32.409]  And I'm wondering if you view it the same way, and do you view the U.S.
[03:01:32.409 --> 03:01:34.530]  alliance system shifting under your presidency?
[03:01:34.530 --> 03:01:36.872]  Who are you with, I'm curious.
[03:01:36.872 --> 03:01:37.032]  CNN.
[03:01:39.528 --> 03:01:40.028]  I figured.
[03:01:40.028 --> 03:01:41.489]  Fake news, CNN.
[03:01:41.489 --> 03:01:42.829]  The worst.
[03:01:42.829 --> 03:01:45.690]  But, you know, I could tell by the... I have no idea you were CNN.
[03:01:45.690 --> 03:01:47.831]  After the question, I was just curious as to who you're with.
[03:01:47.831 --> 03:01:48.351]  You were CNN.
[03:01:48.351 --> 03:01:51.993]  Can I just ask you... Thank you very much, Mr. President.
[03:01:51.993 --> 03:01:53.113]  Where are you from?
[03:01:53.113 --> 03:01:53.413]  BBC.
[03:01:53.413 --> 03:01:56.395]  Here's another beauty.
[03:01:56.395 --> 03:01:57.095]  It's a good line.
[03:01:58.195 --> 03:01:59.777]  Impartial, free and fair.
[03:01:59.777 --> 03:02:01.398]  Yeah, sure.
[03:02:01.398 --> 03:02:03.160]  Mr. President... Just like CNN, right?
[03:02:03.160 --> 03:02:09.606]  Just because of the attack of fake news and attacking our network, I just want to ask you, sir... I'm changing it from fake news, though.
[03:02:09.606 --> 03:02:11.388]  Doesn't that under... Very fake news.
[03:02:11.388 --> 03:02:12.149]  I know, but aren't you...
[03:02:15.165 --> 03:02:16.105]  Go ahead.
[03:02:16.105 --> 03:02:20.547]  Now look, this is America, and you can believe whatever you want to believe.
[03:02:20.547 --> 03:02:23.368]  18% of the public says they've seen or been in the presence of a ghost.
[03:02:23.368 --> 03:02:24.749]  I mean, whatever.
[03:02:24.749 --> 03:02:28.290]  I want you all to know that we are fighting the fake news.
[03:02:28.290 --> 03:02:29.231]  It's fake.
[03:02:29.231 --> 03:02:29.811]  Phony.
[03:02:29.811 --> 03:02:36.133]  Fake.
[03:02:36.133 --> 03:02:41.075]  A few days ago, I called the fake news the enemy of the people, and they are.
[03:02:41.075 --> 03:02:42.496]  They are the enemy of the people.
[03:02:44.665 --> 03:02:48.107]  Mr. President, will you stop calling us the enemy of the people, sir?
[03:02:48.107 --> 03:02:49.788]  They're very dishonest people.
[03:02:49.788 --> 03:03:00.874]  In fact, in covering my comments, the dishonest media did not explain that I called the fake news the enemy of the people, the fakeness.
[03:03:00.874 --> 03:03:04.456]  They dropped off the word fake.
[03:03:04.456 --> 03:03:08.439]  And all of a sudden, the story became the media
[03:03:09.928 --> 03:03:13.009]  They take the word fake out.
[03:03:13.009 --> 03:03:16.130]  And now I'm saying, no, this is no good.
[03:03:16.130 --> 03:03:18.871]  But that's the way they are.
[03:03:18.871 --> 03:03:20.031]  I'm having a good time.
[03:03:20.031 --> 03:03:24.572]  Tomorrow they will say Donald Trump rants and raves at the press.
[03:03:24.572 --> 03:03:25.693]  I'm not ranting and raving.
[03:03:25.693 --> 03:03:27.653]  I'm just telling you, you're dishonest people.
[03:03:27.653 --> 03:03:30.254]  But I'm not ranting and raving.
[03:03:30.254 --> 03:03:30.694]  I love this.
[03:03:30.694 --> 03:03:32.475]  I'm having a good time doing it.
[03:03:32.475 --> 03:03:36.476]  But tomorrow the headlines are going to be Donald Trump rants and
[03:03:37.799 --> 03:03:39.480]  I'm not ranting, I'm not ranting.
[03:03:39.480 --> 03:03:45.362]  Fake news is the worst thing that you can call a journalist.
[03:03:45.362 --> 03:03:47.824]  It's like an ethnic disparagement.
[03:03:47.824 --> 03:03:50.525]  You know, we all have these ugly words for people.
[03:03:50.525 --> 03:03:51.865]  That's the one for journalists.
[03:03:51.865 --> 03:03:58.989]  Can we ask you some more questions?
[03:03:58.989 --> 03:03:59.049]  We
[03:04:04.656 --> 03:04:16.600]  We are in a rigged system, and a big part of the rigging are these dishonest people in the media.
[03:04:16.600 --> 03:04:18.240]  Big part of it.
[03:04:18.240 --> 03:04:27.843]  The tone, Jim, if you look, the hatred, I mean, sometimes, sometimes somebody gets, well, you look at your show that goes on at 10 o'clock in the evening.
[03:04:29.338 --> 03:04:30.919]  You just take a look at that channel.
[03:04:30.919 --> 03:04:32.799]  That is a constant hit.
[03:04:32.799 --> 03:04:34.280]  The panel is almost always exclusive.
[03:04:34.280 --> 03:04:35.580]  It's President Trump.
[03:04:35.580 --> 03:04:38.181]  It's the greatest president in modern history.
[03:04:38.181 --> 03:04:44.924]  His attacks on the fake media are so glorious, so justified, and we just love President Trump for it.
[03:04:44.924 --> 03:04:47.404]  That compilation is going to be up on the Alex Jones Channel.
[03:04:47.404 --> 03:04:48.945]  Share it far and wide.
[03:04:48.945 --> 03:04:51.246]  CNN is very fake news.
[03:04:54.198 --> 03:04:58.140]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[03:04:58.140 --> 03:05:01.442]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[03:05:01.442 --> 03:05:07.705]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[03:05:07.705 --> 03:05:10.467]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[03:05:11.207 --> 03:05:15.031]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[03:05:15.031 --> 03:05:21.498]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[03:05:21.498 --> 03:05:26.463]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[03:05:27.222 --> 03:05:31.144]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[03:05:31.144 --> 03:05:38.327]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:05:38.327 --> 03:05:43.549]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[03:05:43.549 --> 03:05:49.251]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:05:49.251 --> 03:05:53.213]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:06:02.282 --> 03:06:10.848]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:10.848 --> 03:06:12.889]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:12.889 --> 03:06:14.770]  This is the fourth hour.
[03:06:14.770 --> 03:06:18.893]  I'm Joel Gilbert, coming to you right from the left coast in Los Angeles.
[03:06:18.893 --> 03:06:31.361]  You know me as a frequent guest of Alex, also filmmaker of recent films in the Alex Jones Store, Trump the Art of the Insult, There's No Place Like Utopia, and of course the classic now, Dreams for My Real Father.
[03:06:32.611 --> 03:06:33.852]  We will be taking calls later.
[03:06:33.852 --> 03:06:37.813]  It's 877-789-2539.
[03:06:37.813 --> 03:06:41.315]  1-877-789-ALEX.
[03:06:41.315 --> 03:06:43.136]  Now, we have a lot to be thankful for.
[03:06:43.136 --> 03:06:44.456]  Here we are in the middle of July.
[03:06:44.456 --> 03:06:46.937]  Fourth of July was last week.
[03:06:46.937 --> 03:06:47.998]  Check out this photo of me.
[03:06:47.998 --> 03:06:52.900]  This is here in Malibu, California, from the filming of There's No Place Like Utopia.
[03:06:52.900 --> 03:06:56.982]  From the mountains to the prairies to the oceans, God bless America.
[03:06:56.982 --> 03:06:59.083]  It's been a glorious Fourth of July.
[03:07:00.114 --> 03:07:02.596]  It would not have been a happy day if Hillary were president.
[03:07:02.596 --> 03:07:17.705]  We would have had rule by executive order, a bad economy, over-taxation, over-regulation, no jobs, Obamacare, open borders, inner-city crime, attacks on police, race division, corruption of the legal system.
[03:07:17.705 --> 03:07:24.349]  Imagine that Hillary was president and we have two radical leftist judges on the Supreme Court.
[03:07:24.349 --> 03:07:28.452]  We could have just kissed our Constitution goodbye if Hillary was president.
[03:07:29.356 --> 03:07:35.679]  Of course, Hillary would pursue Obama's pro-Russia policies, pro-Iran, TTP.
[03:07:35.679 --> 03:07:38.600]  The United States would have been finished.
[03:07:38.600 --> 03:07:44.263]  We almost witnessed, very close, in this last election, what Ronald Reagan was talking about.
[03:07:44.263 --> 03:07:45.943]  Let's play that video of Ronald Reagan.
[03:07:45.943 --> 03:07:52.186]  Very seminal moment.
[03:07:52.186 --> 03:07:54.367]  Play the Reagan video.
[03:07:54.367 --> 03:07:58.569]  They remind us that freedom is never more than one generation.
[03:07:59.138 --> 03:08:04.462]  So we almost descended into permanent liberal fascism under Hillary Clinton, Chuck Schumer, Maxine Waters, Pelosi.
[03:08:04.462 --> 03:08:07.124]  There never would have been another free election.
[03:08:27.094 --> 03:08:30.460]  I want to give you my take on the Peter Strzok hearings.
[03:08:30.460 --> 03:08:34.005]  Some things were talked about that I think people kind of missed.
[03:08:34.005 --> 03:08:34.626]  Very important.
[03:08:34.626 --> 03:08:37.451]  Let's play the first video, the Strzok bias video.
[03:08:38.786 --> 03:08:43.208]  My testimony is, Bob Mueller did not kick you off because of the content of your text.
[03:08:43.208 --> 03:08:46.490]  He kicked you off because of some appearance that he was worried about.
[03:08:46.490 --> 03:08:51.993]  My testimony, what you asked and what I responded to was that he kicked me off because of my bias.
[03:08:51.993 --> 03:08:56.375]  I'm stating to you it is not my understanding that he kicked me off because of any bias.
[03:08:56.375 --> 03:08:59.857]  That it was done based on the appearance.
[03:08:59.857 --> 03:09:02.018]  Now, this was actually true.
[03:09:02.018 --> 03:09:05.900]  This was the one thing that Peter Strzok said where he wasn't lying.
[03:09:05.900 --> 03:09:07.101]  And I think everyone missed it.
[03:09:07.774 --> 03:09:15.157]  There are 13 Democrats on the Mueller Special Counsel probe, and they're all completely biased.
[03:09:15.157 --> 03:09:23.461]  The only problem that Mueller had with Strzok is because he was stupid enough to text his bias, and it gave the appearance of bias.
[03:09:23.461 --> 03:09:25.161]  It was a public display of bias.
[03:09:25.161 --> 03:09:33.245]  That was the only problem that Mueller had with Peter Strzok, and that is a very important distinction that I think people missed.
[03:09:35.374 --> 03:09:43.597]  Let's play the next video on the Tennessee congressman, very embarrassing because I'm from Tennessee, talking about Peter Strzok deserving a Purple Heart.
[03:09:43.597 --> 03:09:44.637]  Let's play that one.
[03:09:44.637 --> 03:09:46.958]  Purple Heart for Peter Strzok.
[03:09:46.958 --> 03:09:50.039]  If I could give you a Purple Heart, I would.
[03:09:50.039 --> 03:09:52.199]  You deserve one.
[03:09:52.199 --> 03:10:00.582]  This has been an attack on you in a way to attack Mr. Mueller and the investigation that is to get at Russia collusion involved in our election.
[03:10:02.168 --> 03:10:08.715]  So we saw about eight years of Obama and what was really stealth radical socialism.
[03:10:08.715 --> 03:10:11.378]  Don't forget, Obama ran as a mainstream candidate.
[03:10:11.378 --> 03:10:13.761]  He said, I'm going to cut the deficit in half.
[03:10:13.761 --> 03:10:16.243]  Marriage is between man and a woman and God.
[03:10:16.243 --> 03:10:17.505]  I'll obey the Constitution.
[03:10:17.505 --> 03:10:24.172]  Of course, then he went and pursued a radical agenda that no one voted for and tried to kind of keep quiet about it.
[03:10:25.015 --> 03:10:30.397]  Now, the Democrats are back into open revolution.
[03:10:30.397 --> 03:10:36.480]  They tried to keep it quiet for some years, but they're just calling for the most radical policies.
[03:10:36.480 --> 03:10:41.762]  And so today, the Democrat Party is a radical socialist party in the open.
[03:10:41.762 --> 03:10:51.867]  And I believe that's why, despite most people very pleased with Trump's economy and things that are getting done, I think America remains in grave danger because
[03:10:52.819 --> 03:10:55.581]  There'll be elections one day that the Republicans will lose.
[03:10:55.581 --> 03:10:56.982]  They could mess up the economy.
[03:10:56.982 --> 03:10:58.503]  There could be corruption.
[03:10:58.503 --> 03:11:02.346]  Don't forget voter fraud by Democrats.
[03:11:02.346 --> 03:11:12.434]  And the next time Hillary or Cory Booker, one of these guys, gets into power, they're not going to leave it up to bumbling idiots like Peter Strzok or phony dossiers.
[03:11:12.434 --> 03:11:17.198]  They will no doubt take care of the next election and not allow a free election.
[03:11:18.044 --> 03:11:23.806]  Now, I wrote an article in American Thinker a week ago last Friday that went totally viral.
[03:11:23.806 --> 03:11:31.848]  It came out on Friday, and Michael Goodwin from the New York Post pretty much copied it on Sunday, and the Drudge Report picked it up.
[03:11:31.848 --> 03:11:34.088]  Let's show that Drudge headline.
[03:11:34.088 --> 03:11:38.890]  Drudge had it for a full day last Sunday that Hillary is running again in 2020.
[03:11:40.385 --> 03:11:44.166]  Now, Michael Goodwin didn't give me credit, but that's typical.
[03:11:44.166 --> 03:11:51.469]  But the main point is that I wanted to share a view that was able to to get out there.
[03:11:51.469 --> 03:11:56.070]  And it was picked up by many other news outlets, Fox and many others.
[03:11:56.070 --> 03:11:59.811]  And it was really been continuing all week.
[03:11:59.811 --> 03:12:04.413]  And I make the case that Hillary is running for president again in 2020.
[03:12:04.413 --> 03:12:08.054]  And I'm going to walk you through this and tell you why this is happening.
[03:12:08.946 --> 03:12:18.594]  Later on we're going to bring on Daniel Greenfield from Front Page Magazine to talk about some of his incredible articles, but I'm going to walk you through this scenario.
[03:12:18.594 --> 03:12:26.160]  First thing I'm going to point out is you have to really understand Hillary Clinton and how the Clintons never quit, how they think and why they never quit.
[03:12:27.190 --> 03:12:37.283]  Her life mantra, which she's repeated and written about for years, is this lesson she says her mother taught her about what defines you in life is not getting knocked down.
[03:12:37.283 --> 03:12:39.366]  It's about how you get back up.
[03:12:39.366 --> 03:12:41.349]  So let's play this Hillary Mom story.
[03:12:41.349 --> 03:12:42.751]  She tells it over and over.
[03:12:42.751 --> 03:12:43.412]  Let's play the video.
[03:12:44.251 --> 03:12:45.192]  I was pretty shy.
[03:12:45.192 --> 03:12:46.653]  I was a kind of reserved little girl.
[03:12:46.653 --> 03:12:48.195]  Really?
[03:12:48.195 --> 03:12:58.103]  Yes, I would go outside to play and literally I would get knocked down and pushed around by all the little kids.
[03:12:58.103 --> 03:13:07.131]  I ran back in crying and my mother met me at the door and she said, you go right back out there and stand up for yourself.
[03:13:07.131 --> 03:13:09.393]  So this is the story Hillary tells.
[03:13:10.166 --> 03:13:18.171]  And for her, the defeat by Trump was the ultimate calling that she has to fulfill this destiny and show that she can get back up.
[03:13:18.171 --> 03:13:20.092]  The Clintons never quit.
[03:13:20.092 --> 03:13:21.413]  Doesn't matter the adversity.
[03:13:21.413 --> 03:13:27.096]  Whitewater, Ken Starr, impeachment, Chinagate, Benghazi, email server scandal.
[03:13:27.096 --> 03:13:29.358]  You could fill up pages.
[03:13:29.358 --> 03:13:37.883]  And you also have to ask yourself, how come the Clintons have a rap sheet that would make Al Capone blush and they never go to jail?
[03:13:38.920 --> 03:13:40.861]  It's because they never give up.
[03:13:40.861 --> 03:13:46.102]  The minute the Clintons quit politics is the minute they risk prosecution.
[03:13:46.102 --> 03:13:50.304]  They know the only way to stay out of jail is to frighten the jailers.
[03:13:50.304 --> 03:13:55.785]  Remember Lisa Page wrote Peter Strzok, be careful when you interview Hillary, she's going to be president.
[03:13:55.785 --> 03:13:58.886]  This is how they all feel.
[03:13:58.886 --> 03:14:06.489]  So the idea that she has the potential to be in power frightens anybody who has any crime on the Clintons.
[03:14:07.173 --> 03:14:10.655]  Now, of course, other than running for president, she has nothing else to do.
[03:14:10.655 --> 03:14:15.799]  She's not taking yoga classes anymore, and Chelsea's wedding is over.
[03:14:15.799 --> 03:14:17.540]  So, look at her history.
[03:14:17.540 --> 03:14:21.363]  She's been running for president since 1992.
[03:14:21.363 --> 03:14:30.809]  And since she lost in 2016, only by a few votes in a few states, she really has ramped up the campaign from Ireland to Australia to India.
[03:14:31.539 --> 03:14:35.240]  The campaign continues and the message remains the same.
[03:14:35.240 --> 03:14:41.603]  Donald Trump is racist and sexist and his deporters are absolutely deplorable.
[03:14:41.603 --> 03:14:45.164]  Let's play the video of her in India from a few weeks ago.
[03:14:45.164 --> 03:14:46.904]  Hillary in India.
[03:14:46.904 --> 03:14:48.065]  Map of the United States.
[03:14:48.065 --> 03:14:51.226]  There's all that red in the middle where Trump won.
[03:14:51.226 --> 03:14:56.508]  I won the places that represent two-thirds of America's gross domestic product.
[03:14:57.399 --> 03:15:10.048]  I won the places that are optimistic, diverse, dynamic, moving forward, and his whole campaign, Make America Great Again, was looking backwards.
[03:15:10.048 --> 03:15:18.194]  You know, you didn't like black people getting rights, you don't like women getting jobs, you don't want to see that Indian American succeeding more than you are.
[03:15:18.194 --> 03:15:22.077]  Whatever your problem is, I'm going to solve it.
[03:15:24.048 --> 03:15:26.429]  So this is what Hillary's up to.
[03:15:26.429 --> 03:15:27.950]  She's preaching continually.
[03:15:27.950 --> 03:15:34.353]  She won the 2016 election by 3 million votes, except for that damn Constitution thing.
[03:15:34.353 --> 03:15:38.355]  And Russia, Russia, Russia, she was robbed of her rightful place in history.
[03:15:38.355 --> 03:15:42.678]  And today's indictments against mysterious Russians just feeds into that.
[03:15:42.678 --> 03:15:43.938]  So we'll be right back.
[03:15:43.938 --> 03:15:48.821]  We're going to talk more about Hillary 2020 and Daniel Greenfield coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[03:15:53.348 --> 03:15:55.229]  Healthcare reform is confusing.

[03:20:22.592 --> 03:20:31.594]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:31.594 --> 03:20:34.034]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:34.034 --> 03:20:46.757]  Joel Gilbert from Los Angeles, right from the left coast, continuing to talk about Hillary 2020, my article in American Thinker that went viral all week, picked up by New York Post, Fox News, everybody's talking about it.
[03:20:47.415 --> 03:20:49.976]  I'm going to talk now about her path to the nomination.
[03:20:49.976 --> 03:20:55.199]  Daniel Greenfield, Front Page Magazine, coming up, bottom of the hour.
[03:20:55.199 --> 03:20:58.220]  Every candidate has to demonstrate a path to the nomination.
[03:20:58.220 --> 03:20:59.981]  How can they get there?
[03:20:59.981 --> 03:21:06.604]  Hillary is actually the only candidate on the Democrat side with a plausible path to the nomination.
[03:21:06.604 --> 03:21:08.064]  And here's how it goes.
[03:21:08.064 --> 03:21:11.506]  In the primaries, Hillary, just with her name recognition,
[03:21:12.245 --> 03:21:12.425]  Yes.
[03:21:32.191 --> 03:21:37.192]  And in each primary, he would win it because he had the solid base.
[03:21:37.192 --> 03:21:43.374]  Every time someone else dropped out, he'd pick up about half their supporters and the rest would be split amongst the rest.
[03:21:43.374 --> 03:21:46.055]  So this is a realistic path for Hillary.
[03:21:46.055 --> 03:21:47.555]  That's number one.
[03:21:47.555 --> 03:21:52.117]  Secondly, she's the only candidate with big money raising potential.
[03:21:52.117 --> 03:21:56.398]  She's had a mechanism for raising money for 30 years.
[03:21:56.398 --> 03:21:57.018]  And don't forget,
[03:21:57.805 --> 03:22:02.791]  She has a billion dollars stashed away in the Clinton Foundation for just such a rainy day.
[03:22:02.791 --> 03:22:11.761]  You didn't really think that all that Russian oligarch money, Uranium One money, went to hungry children in Haiti, you know, did you?
[03:22:11.761 --> 03:22:13.663]  The next thing is the media.
[03:22:13.663 --> 03:22:14.945]  They're going to celebrate Hillary.
[03:22:14.945 --> 03:22:18.429]  They're going to give her 10 billion of free media earned advertising.
[03:22:19.329 --> 03:22:22.210]  And they'll say that she doesn't back down.
[03:22:22.210 --> 03:22:24.271]  She was robbed by the Russians.
[03:22:24.271 --> 03:22:25.492]  She has unfinished business.
[03:22:25.492 --> 03:22:27.032]  She's going to break the glass ceiling.
[03:22:27.032 --> 03:22:31.154]  You know, round two between Hillary and Trump.
[03:22:31.154 --> 03:22:33.095]  She's doing it for women.
[03:22:33.095 --> 03:22:37.877]  And the MSM journalists, they want jobs in a Clinton administration.
[03:22:37.877 --> 03:22:42.058]  So look for the media to support this effort as well.
[03:22:42.058 --> 03:22:46.080]  Also, the Electoral College heavily favors Democrats.
[03:22:46.080 --> 03:22:47.541]  She knows that.
[03:22:47.541 --> 03:22:48.281]  And Deep State
[03:22:49.312 --> 03:22:54.757]  Leftists are probably going to help her from inside the government leaking things about Trump.
[03:22:54.757 --> 03:23:04.344]  Don't forget that Tom Arnold has been bragging, the actor has been bragging about having some stupid thing that Trump might have said years ago on a tape somewhere.
[03:23:04.344 --> 03:23:09.468]  And leftists are registering voters every day in these swing states.
[03:23:09.468 --> 03:23:12.411]  Age is not a factor for Hillary because she's about the same age as Trump.
[03:23:13.371 --> 03:23:16.053]  And she knows she has to run.
[03:23:16.053 --> 03:23:33.023]  It forces her to run this time because when she's 77 in 2024, she'll definitely be rejected, probably for a younger ethnic candidate, someone like Joe Biden said about Obama, who's articulate and clean, and probably even more radical.
[03:23:33.023 --> 03:23:40.207]  So while Hillary knows it will be an uphill battle to face Trump, she sees that she has to position herself.
[03:23:40.885 --> 03:23:42.626]  And that she has a chance.
[03:23:42.626 --> 03:23:45.288]  Don't forget, she has the same opportunity with the DNC.
[03:23:45.288 --> 03:23:47.170]  The DNC is broke.
[03:23:47.170 --> 03:23:53.874]  Because they spent $12 million paying off Russians to write fictional short stories for $300,000 per page.
[03:23:53.874 --> 03:23:58.618]  The most money ever paid for a fictional 35-page short story.
[03:23:58.618 --> 03:24:00.939]  So she can offer the DNC again.
[03:24:00.939 --> 03:24:04.462]  We'll fund you if I can call the shots on the debates, the primaries, everything.
[03:24:05.327 --> 03:24:09.251]  Her pal Tom Perez, she placed him at the head of the DNC.
[03:24:09.251 --> 03:24:14.075]  So everything is set up for Hillary to make this comeback.
[03:24:14.075 --> 03:24:21.162]  And you're also going to see that any potentially good Democrat candidates are going to say, wait a minute, Trump is a little too tough to beat.
[03:24:21.162 --> 03:24:22.123]  Hillary is going to be tough.
[03:24:22.123 --> 03:24:23.564]  She's got the money.
[03:24:23.564 --> 03:24:25.686]  I think I'll wait till 2024.
[03:24:25.686 --> 03:24:31.091]  So that leaves Hillary with a bunch of publicity hounds and a clear path to the nomination.
[03:24:32.074 --> 03:24:36.137]  I'm sure the rest of the Democrats would like to also use that to clear out the old guard.
[03:24:36.137 --> 03:24:47.864]  Hillary, Pocahontas, Crazy Bernie, Biden, and be able to start this new radical party based on younger people like the girl in New York.
[03:24:47.864 --> 03:24:52.287]  Now, how else could Hillary defeat Trump?
[03:24:52.287 --> 03:24:54.908]  Let's play my video called Early Vote.
[03:24:54.908 --> 03:24:58.611]  This is the Democrat Party voter fraud formula.
[03:24:58.611 --> 03:25:00.372]  Let's take a look at Early Vote, how they do it.
[03:25:01.852 --> 03:25:05.274]  Do you know if the illegal immigrants vote?
[03:25:05.274 --> 03:25:06.455]  Yes, they do vote.
[03:25:06.455 --> 03:25:07.055]  They do?
[03:25:07.055 --> 03:25:08.236]  Yes.
[03:25:08.236 --> 03:25:09.117]  How's that possible?
[03:25:09.117 --> 03:25:10.317]  Well, it's very easy.
[03:25:10.317 --> 03:25:16.641]  You go to these supermarkets, and you see these people that are registering people to vote, and they can't even speak English.
[03:25:16.641 --> 03:25:19.163]  And they sign them up to register to vote.
[03:25:19.163 --> 03:25:22.585]  They get mail-in ballots, and then they just mail them back off.
[03:25:22.585 --> 03:25:23.806]  There's no way of tracking them.
[03:25:24.286 --> 03:25:25.907]  Here in Illinois, we've got early vote.
[03:25:25.907 --> 03:25:33.533]  And in a lot of the states, in Ohio, Florida, Nevada, and Colorado, you do it on your own time, and it's really convenient.
[03:25:33.533 --> 03:25:36.214]  We're recruiting and training Latino organizers.
[03:25:36.214 --> 03:25:40.217]  We're holding Latino voter registration drives across America.
[03:25:40.217 --> 03:25:43.740]  We will transform this nation.
[03:25:43.740 --> 03:25:46.822]  So that was an excerpt from There's No Place Like Utopia from my film.
[03:25:47.458 --> 03:25:47.718]  We're good.
[03:26:01.480 --> 03:26:04.361]  Originally in Chicago because every cemetery voted.
[03:26:04.361 --> 03:26:12.283]  They have all three and a half million people in America are on the voting registration even though they're dead.
[03:26:12.283 --> 03:26:21.546]  So the potential for voter fraud is the biggest thing that they believe in including George Soros and his gang operating the voting machines.
[03:26:21.546 --> 03:26:27.268]  So there's a lot of ways that Hillary sees a path to victory.
[03:26:27.268 --> 03:26:29.089]  So that's why I say get ready for Hillary 2020.
[03:26:30.504 --> 03:26:34.886]  Because she will try everything to win the White House.
[03:26:34.886 --> 03:26:37.927]  Don't forget, in 2016, she did not concede.
[03:26:37.927 --> 03:26:48.192]  Even though she lost, she wouldn't concede because they were holding back certain numbers of votes in certain swing states to see if it would bridge the gap.
[03:26:48.192 --> 03:26:52.154]  Only when she realized it was too much, she went ahead and conceded.
[03:26:52.154 --> 03:26:57.876]  So all Hillary needs is about 300% of the vote in five counties in three swing states.
[03:26:57.876 --> 03:26:58.776]  300% of the vote.
[03:27:00.896 --> 03:27:10.200]  And by the time the Republicans or anybody figures out, wait a minute, how can you get three times the number of human beings located in that county?
[03:27:10.200 --> 03:27:18.925]  The new Democrat Attorney General Keith Ellison will call everybody racist and put us on a, you know, a hate speech watch list.
[03:27:18.925 --> 03:27:23.287]  So I say get ready for Hillary 2020.
[03:27:23.287 --> 03:27:25.628]  She believes she's on the right side of history.
[03:27:25.628 --> 03:27:27.809]  She believes she represents our values.
[03:27:28.689 --> 03:27:35.911]  Don't forget, like her radical mentor Saul Alinsky, she believes that the ends justifies the means.
[03:27:35.911 --> 03:27:49.335]  And patriots will have to rally once again to save America from a final defeat at the hands of a now openly radical Democrat Socialist Party led by Hillary Clinton.
[03:27:49.335 --> 03:27:51.696]  And if she wins, they're not going to fool around, as I said, with
[03:27:52.734 --> 03:27:59.039]  Text messages and dossiers, they'll see to it that there is never another free election.
[03:27:59.039 --> 03:28:01.200]  2012 was not a free election.
[03:28:01.200 --> 03:28:06.664]  Obama used the IRS to suppress the conservatives, break up the Tea Party movement.
[03:28:06.664 --> 03:28:10.547]  2016, DOJ, IRS try to stop Trump.
[03:28:10.547 --> 03:28:13.870]  And if he does get elected, to be able to impeach him, and they're still working at it today.
[03:28:14.531 --> 03:28:21.527]  So the radical left are anti-American, anti-Democrat, and Hillary Clinton will likely be their leader.
[03:28:21.527 --> 03:28:23.933]  We'll be right back with Daniel Greenfield in the next segment.
[03:28:53.365 --> 03:28:55.226]  Healthcare reform is confusing.
[03:28:55.226 --> 03:29:03.832]  But whether it's finding an affordable insurance plan, keeping your doctor, or being able to afford needed prescriptions, navigating the healthcare system has become a challenge.

[03:31:54.045 --> 03:31:57.988]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[03:31:57.988 --> 03:32:01.271]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[03:32:01.271 --> 03:32:07.556]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[03:32:07.556 --> 03:32:10.319]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[03:32:11.059 --> 03:32:14.864]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[03:32:14.864 --> 03:32:21.352]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[03:32:21.352 --> 03:32:26.318]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[03:32:27.048 --> 03:32:30.990]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[03:32:30.990 --> 03:32:38.174]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:32:38.174 --> 03:32:42.876]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[03:32:42.876 --> 03:32:49.100]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:32:49.100 --> 03:32:53.062]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:32:57.128 --> 03:33:08.490]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:08.490 --> 03:33:18.712]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[03:33:18.712 --> 03:33:20.853]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:20.853 --> 03:33:22.453]  I'm Joel Gilbert, filmmaker,
[03:33:23.448 --> 03:33:26.471]  Right here in Southern California, coming to you live.
[03:33:26.471 --> 03:33:34.738]  I want to welcome now, from FrontPage Magazine, FrontPageMag.com, one of the most brilliant writers of our time.
[03:33:34.738 --> 03:33:38.261]  You've got to read all this fantastic articles, brilliant analysis.
[03:33:38.261 --> 03:33:39.523]  You should be checking it every day.
[03:33:39.523 --> 03:33:43.266]  Let's welcome Daniel Greenfield to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:43.266 --> 03:33:44.767]  Hi, Daniel.
[03:33:44.767 --> 03:33:45.308]  Hi, Joel.
[03:33:45.308 --> 03:33:46.529]  Thank you so much for having me on.
[03:33:47.674 --> 03:33:48.575]  Okay, great to have you.
[03:33:48.575 --> 03:33:53.879]  Well, your articles have been read and tweeted all over the place for years.
[03:33:53.879 --> 03:33:58.903]  Let's take some of the more recent ones and kind of get your take.
[03:33:58.903 --> 03:34:07.370]  Starting with one of these recent ones, you called it, I love the title, the Maxine Waters Marxist Minstrel Show.
[03:34:07.370 --> 03:34:13.395]  And you called her the political blackface of the white left.
[03:34:13.395 --> 03:34:16.478]  Now, she said that civility is racist.
[03:34:18.578 --> 03:34:24.914]  Tell us, Daniel, why is civility racist or why is it not racist and what is she doing as this Marxist minstrel out there?
[03:34:26.212 --> 03:34:28.573]  Well, anything that the left doesn't like is racist.
[03:34:28.573 --> 03:34:30.134]  We already all know that.
[03:34:30.134 --> 03:34:37.899]  And so, the left, which is largely white, finds it very useful to take these black radicals and use them as a front for their violence, for their attacks.
[03:34:37.899 --> 03:34:49.747]  If you actually look at the history of race riots in this country, it goes back to communist agitators very deliberately going into black communities, finding some people, starting riots, and then claiming that there's a revolution going on.
[03:34:49.747 --> 03:34:51.708]  So, absolutely nothing has changed since then.
[03:34:51.708 --> 03:34:55.090]  Black Lives Matter is just the latest incarnation of the same exact program.
[03:34:55.510 --> 03:35:16.565]  And it's very useful to take people like Maxine Waters, who does not live anywhere near where her constituents do, who is making a lot of money even though she has absolutely nothing in the way of a real election challenge, and then send her out there, call for violence, call for harassment of people who disagree with her, and then when she's called out on that, right away they claim, well, people just can't handle a strong black woman.
[03:35:16.565 --> 03:35:22.769]  But if you actually look at the rally in Los Angeles, where she issued this call for harassing Trump administration cabinet members,
[03:35:23.507 --> 03:35:26.309]  Everybody around her is white, because that's the real truth about the left.
[03:35:26.309 --> 03:35:27.830]  It's political blackface.
[03:35:27.830 --> 03:35:33.454]  You've got a whole bunch of white lefties who are the ones who actually go out and kill people, who attack people.
[03:35:33.454 --> 03:35:39.418]  And then you've got a few of these token black people who are there as radicals, who are there to provide cover, because they're the oppressed.
[03:35:39.418 --> 03:35:42.320]  You know, Maxine Waters is a millionaire, is very oppressed.
[03:35:43.760 --> 03:35:48.884]  Well, it seems like the ultimate evil that white communists would manipulate black people.
[03:35:48.884 --> 03:35:52.847]  You've got to ask, why would these black people participate in this?
[03:35:52.847 --> 03:35:57.470]  You've probably seen my movie in the Alex Jones store, Dreams from My Real Father.
[03:35:57.470 --> 03:36:04.235]  And I showed that Obama's real father was the black Bolshevik named Frank Marshall Davis out of Chicago.
[03:36:04.235 --> 03:36:10.539]  And his job was to, as a journalist, was to try to recruit black people into the communist movement.
[03:36:10.539 --> 03:36:11.080]  At the time,
[03:36:11.897 --> 03:36:13.538]  Black people were no fools.
[03:36:13.538 --> 03:36:15.059]  They were religious people.
[03:36:15.059 --> 03:36:16.440]  They believed in love thy neighbor.
[03:36:16.440 --> 03:36:20.222]  They didn't like the Marxist idea of the war between classes.
[03:36:20.222 --> 03:36:23.724]  They believed in peace and love.
[03:36:23.724 --> 03:36:25.885]  Davis was sent to Hawaii by the Soviet Union.
[03:36:25.885 --> 03:36:27.426]  He was a Russian agent.
[03:36:27.426 --> 03:36:36.072]  I maintain in my film that he was Barack Obama's, not only his mentor that Obama admits raised him, and I believe radicalized him, that was his real father.
[03:36:36.072 --> 03:36:41.495]  But then Obama goes back to Chicago 1982, follows in Frank Marshall Davis's footsteps,
[03:36:42.259 --> 03:36:51.306]  The white communists recruit him to penetrate the black church groups through that developing communities project to try to get them into the socialist groups.
[03:36:51.306 --> 03:36:59.433]  Why are these black people that seem intelligent, like Obama, cooperating with the communist white agenda to manipulate other blacks?
[03:37:00.325 --> 03:37:01.265]  Well, you mentioned Obama.
[03:37:01.265 --> 03:37:02.386]  He's a perfect example.
[03:37:02.386 --> 03:37:04.087]  He's completely inauthentic.
[03:37:04.087 --> 03:37:08.029]  He had nothing to do with the black community, even aside from the whole racial issue.
[03:37:08.029 --> 03:37:10.510]  This was a guy who had been raised in privilege.
[03:37:10.510 --> 03:37:22.815]  And even in his various memoirs, which, as you've documented, are very dubious and very shaky, he talks about having to somehow penetrate the black community, get some sort of sense of a black identity, because it was not natural to him.
[03:37:24.136 --> 03:37:31.480]  Father Flagers talked about how Obama had to go to these churches to try and pass himself off as Christian because he really was not part of it.
[03:37:31.480 --> 03:37:32.500]  He was not part of that world.
[03:37:32.500 --> 03:37:33.981]  He was not authentically black.
[03:37:33.981 --> 03:37:40.764]  And when you look at these black radical leaders, I mean, on the extreme end, you have Sean King and Black Lives Matter was basically white, as far as anybody can tell.
[03:37:40.764 --> 03:37:45.887]  And actually, the original founder of the Nation of Islam is also believed to have been a white man.
[03:37:46.247 --> 03:37:46.307]  And
[03:38:08.024 --> 03:38:10.987]  Like Maxine Waters, who lives very far from the black community.
[03:38:10.987 --> 03:38:12.228]  She lives in a very nice mansion.
[03:38:12.228 --> 03:38:17.192]  When you look at these leaders of the black urban areas, they don't live in the districts that they represent.
[03:38:19.053 --> 03:38:29.781]  Well, you've been part of the David Horowitz Freedom Center for some time, and I know that David Horowitz has many initiatives where he's trying to expose the lie of the left and how they're using the black community.
[03:38:29.781 --> 03:38:37.587]  What kind of progress do you think he's made, especially since Trump has been in office and he started out by saying, well, what do you got to lose?
[03:38:37.587 --> 03:38:43.992]  These communities where inner cities, urban America has been controlled by Democrats 50, 60 years.
[03:38:43.992 --> 03:38:47.135]  Violence, poor education, drug culture, no fathers in the home.
[03:38:47.836 --> 03:38:53.802]  What progress do you think Trump is making and your organization is making to get this message out?
[03:38:54.989 --> 03:39:07.532]  One of the big ideas that David Hurwitz set out was that we actually have to engage with the black community and a lot of mainstream Republicans were very happy to just ignore them and to just let them divide them as a Democrat voting bloc.
[03:39:07.532 --> 03:39:14.193]  And his idea was you have to actually go into these inner cities, you actually have to expose the crime, the corruption, and you actually have to offer solutions.
[03:39:14.193 --> 03:39:21.495]  So one of his solutions was school vouchers because the Democrat infrastructure is built in no small part on these municipal unions.
[03:39:21.495 --> 03:39:23.395]  The teachers are one of the biggest of the unions.
[03:39:23.975 --> 03:39:28.538]  Teachers and nurses unions are a huge chunk of the Democrat infrastructure.
[03:39:28.538 --> 03:39:34.261]  They fund the money, they push the money right back, they take money out of the schools, and they put it into the Democrat Party.
[03:39:34.261 --> 03:39:39.164]  And he said you need vouchers, and this is something that's been part of the Trump administration program.
[03:39:39.164 --> 03:39:42.747]  You need school vouchers, and then actually you set free black communities.
[03:39:42.747 --> 03:39:47.149]  They're not dependent on these broken schools that teach their kids nothing but how to be leftists.
[03:39:47.149 --> 03:39:49.831]  And so they're actually empowered to control their own education.
[03:39:50.251 --> 03:39:56.354]  Okay, very good.
[03:39:56.354 --> 03:40:01.557]  Alright, let's go on to the next article you wrote.
[03:40:01.557 --> 03:40:05.259]  It's called, Never Trumpers Are Jumping the Shark.
[03:40:05.259 --> 03:40:08.740]  George Will, Bill Kristol, John Kasich, the Bush family.
[03:40:10.393 --> 03:40:14.719]  Even sometimes the new media darling Ben Shapiro, all never Trumpers.
[03:40:14.719 --> 03:40:23.552]  What is a never Trumper and what is their logic in their head as supposedly lifelong Republicans that they're still rejecting this president and his agenda?
[03:40:24.488 --> 03:40:26.731]  So there are a number of Trumpers who generally oppose Trump.
[03:40:26.731 --> 03:40:29.214]  And you know, in any election, there will be people who have different views.
[03:40:29.214 --> 03:40:35.522]  And there are these people whose entire agenda was to undermine the Republican Party, to undermine the conservative movement.
[03:40:35.522 --> 03:40:39.026]  And they did that by pretending to be within the conservative movement.
[03:40:39.026 --> 03:40:43.492]  They did it by pretending to be Republicans, by saying, we just oppose this on principle.
[03:40:43.812 --> 03:40:50.136]  And now when these people are coming out like Max Boot, like George Will, and they're coming out and saying, we want the Democrats to win.
[03:40:50.136 --> 03:40:51.978]  That means there were never Republicans to begin with.
[03:40:51.978 --> 03:40:54.740]  There were Democrats operating from within.
[03:40:54.740 --> 03:41:03.026]  And now they're actually exposing themselves, which is a huge game changer because a lot of these people really defected once Trump began to win and Trump has exposed them.
[03:41:03.026 --> 03:41:06.108]  He's forced them to come out and say, we want the Democrats to win.
[03:41:06.108 --> 03:41:12.112]  And this actually removes a lot of the fake conservative activists who have actually been slowing down and crippling the movement.
[03:41:13.641 --> 03:41:21.834]  Well, how shocked were you or were you not shocked that John McCain, who campaigned for years against Obamacare, was the deciding vote in keeping Obamacare?
[03:41:21.834 --> 03:41:23.796]  Was that surprising to you?
[03:41:23.796 --> 03:41:25.239]  Oh, I mean, I was completely shocked.
[03:41:25.239 --> 03:41:29.205]  The guy who went out to the border and shot this commercial built a danged wall!
[03:41:30.627 --> 03:41:32.549]  Turned out also to be for illegal immigration.
[03:41:32.549 --> 03:41:37.053]  He turned out to completely disagree with all the things he kept saying every six years that he ran for office.
[03:41:37.053 --> 03:41:38.594]  This was an absolutely open secret.
[03:41:38.594 --> 03:41:41.637]  This is something that has infuriated conservatives over the years.
[03:41:41.637 --> 03:41:43.538]  But we had this idea that McCain was untouchable.
[03:41:43.538 --> 03:41:44.639]  He's a war hero.
[03:41:44.639 --> 03:41:46.221]  We can't say anything critical about him.
[03:41:46.221 --> 03:41:51.125]  And then Trump came in and said something critical about him and got away with it, which was a huge game changer.
[03:41:51.125 --> 03:41:54.267]  And now all that's left is this kind of wake for McCain's career.
[03:41:54.267 --> 03:41:56.489]  This pretense that he was some sort of hero.
[03:41:57.901 --> 03:42:00.503]  The reality is that McCain was a complete disaster.
[03:42:00.503 --> 03:42:02.104]  He betrayed family members.
[03:42:02.104 --> 03:42:04.265]  He betrayed the voters over and over again.
[03:42:04.265 --> 03:42:05.225]  He lied to them.
[03:42:05.225 --> 03:42:09.228]  And now he's going out lying to them.
[03:42:09.228 --> 03:42:25.778]  Well, so you're saying that essentially Trump has exposed the Democrats, the rhinos within the Republican Party, and essentially they're all being filtered out, including Bob Corker and others that were just so liberal, who just happened to run as Republicans, that were probably
[03:42:26.457 --> 03:42:29.060]  Preventing the Republican agenda from proceeding all those years.
[03:42:29.060 --> 03:42:35.607]  We're going to be right back with another segment with the great Daniel Greenfield from Front Page Magazine.
[03:42:35.607 --> 03:42:39.832]  We're going to talk about his next article, Sex Lies and the Deep State.
[03:42:39.832 --> 03:42:45.558]  And we'll take a few calls, as well as talk about the Democrat 4th of July statement.
[03:42:45.558 --> 03:42:46.840]  We'll be right back.

[03:44:02.074 --> 03:44:12.902]  When you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[03:44:12.902 --> 03:44:15.023]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.

[03:44:19.026 --> 03:44:20.047]  I want to thank everybody that has.

[03:44:34.096 --> 03:44:36.598]  Infowarslife.com or AAA253-3139.
[03:44:36.598 --> 03:44:45.784]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.

[03:44:53.970 --> 03:45:04.578]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[03:45:04.578 --> 03:45:06.640]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[03:45:06.640 --> 03:45:09.502]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[03:45:09.502 --> 03:45:11.003]  It's made in the USA.
[03:45:11.003 --> 03:45:14.126]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[03:45:14.346 --> 03:45:17.809]  Absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[03:45:17.809 --> 03:45:19.890]  It is a classical 360 win.
[03:45:19.890 --> 03:45:29.598]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[03:45:29.598 --> 03:45:41.928]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America,
[03:45:42.108 --> 03:45:46.414]  To reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.

[03:45:54.161 --> 03:45:56.103]  This 4th of July is special.
[03:45:56.103 --> 03:45:58.105]  Everybody can see it, they can feel it.
[03:45:58.105 --> 03:46:02.550]  The globalists are attempting to kill a worldwide awakening to their tyranny.
[03:46:02.550 --> 03:46:06.915]  And America, yet again, is at the heart of the resistance of the globalists.
[03:46:06.915 --> 03:46:12.020]  That's why this 4th of July I'm asking all of our great supporters to think about Infowars now more than ever.
[03:46:12.020 --> 03:46:15.764]  And what would the world be like if Infowars wasn't there resisting the globalists?
[03:46:16.605 --> 03:46:18.908]  What would have happened if you hadn't supported InfoWars?
[03:46:18.908 --> 03:46:20.850]  We would not be having the victories we have today.
[03:46:20.850 --> 03:46:23.993]  So yes, a lot of good things are happening, but the enemy is striking back.
[03:46:23.993 --> 03:46:31.140]  So please, think about InfoWars and funding our operation while you get great products at the same time on the 4th of July that's so historic.
[03:46:31.140 --> 03:46:33.022]  We have record sales going on right now.

[03:46:52.355 --> 03:46:57.119]  InfoWareStore.com.
[03:46:57.119 --> 03:46:59.781]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:10.580 --> 03:47:14.823]  You're listening to The Antidote for Fake News.
[03:47:14.823 --> 03:47:16.804]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:47:19.080 --> 03:47:22.502]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:22.502 --> 03:47:26.404]  Joel Gilbert in Los Angeles, coming to you right from the left coast.
[03:47:26.404 --> 03:47:37.490]  We're talking to, from FrontPageMag.com, FrontPage Magazine, from the David Horowitz Freedom Center, Daniel Greenfield, the brilliant writer, so many great articles every day.
[03:47:37.490 --> 03:47:39.711]  We're going through some of his recent pieces.
[03:47:39.711 --> 03:47:43.613]  This next one is called, Sex, Lies, and the Deep State.
[03:47:43.613 --> 03:47:46.114]  What the affairs of the deep state tell us about.
[03:47:46.917 --> 03:47:52.921]  Now Daniel, we've got alleged affairs like President Trump and prostitutes in Moscow.
[03:47:52.921 --> 03:47:57.264]  We have alleged affair of Stormy Daniels and President Trump.
[03:47:57.264 --> 03:48:02.387]  And then we've got actual affairs like Peter Strzok and Lisa Page.
[03:48:02.387 --> 03:48:02.888]  First of all,
[03:48:03.815 --> 03:48:06.217]  Is this a personal relationship or political affair?
[03:48:06.217 --> 03:48:08.519]  And what does this mean for the Deep State?
[03:48:08.519 --> 03:48:11.142]  The interesting thing is that it's both.
[03:48:11.142 --> 03:48:13.343]  It's a political affair and it's a personal affair.
[03:48:13.343 --> 03:48:18.048]  We just saw Shizak's testimony that he gave, but there's another level to it.
[03:48:18.048 --> 03:48:23.312]  I mean, Congressman Louie Gohmert challenged him on the whole, you were cheating on your wife thing.
[03:48:23.312 --> 03:48:28.677]  And at the same time, he's being investigated for effectively cheating on the state, cheating on the FBI, cheating on the government.
[03:48:28.997 --> 03:48:29.177]  I think?
[03:48:44.281 --> 03:48:54.486]  As a liaison to bypass the chains of command, the various tiers of the FBI, in order to actually get information directly from Strzok about the investigation.
[03:48:54.486 --> 03:48:57.127]  Now, when Strzok testified, he was very self-righteous.
[03:48:57.127 --> 03:48:59.448]  He said, we have all these multiple tiers.
[03:48:59.448 --> 03:49:00.748]  All these people would be watching.
[03:49:00.748 --> 03:49:02.789]  They would not allow me to do something like this.
[03:49:02.789 --> 03:49:11.313]  But the reality is, because of his personal affair, he was actually able to get past a lot of these tiers and report directly to McCabe using the woman he was having an affair with.
[03:49:11.633 --> 03:49:13.938]  And this is an example of how the two things interrelate.
[03:49:13.938 --> 03:49:15.742]  They combine together.
[03:49:15.742 --> 03:49:18.788]  The adultery, the personal adultery, is also a political adultery.
[03:49:18.788 --> 03:49:22.215]  These people are not just cheating on their wives, they're also cheating on America.
[03:49:23.866 --> 03:49:25.568]  Well, another interesting affair.
[03:49:25.568 --> 03:49:29.191]  It's not an adulterous affair, but it's Bruce and Nellie Orr.
[03:49:29.191 --> 03:49:39.619]  Some information just came out that Peter Strzok admitted that it was Bruce Orr of the DOJ, number four, who brought information from Fusion GPS through his wife, Nellie Orr.
[03:49:39.619 --> 03:49:41.681]  By the way, I went to high school with Bruce Orr.
[03:49:41.681 --> 03:49:44.363]  I know Bruce since I'm six years old.
[03:49:44.363 --> 03:49:49.228]  And it was really a shock to see him involved in this kind of treason against the United States.
[03:49:49.228 --> 03:49:51.089]  That's the high school photo I pulled.
[03:49:52.603 --> 03:49:59.840]  How does Bruce and Nellie or their political affair or their personal relationship turning into a political affair to undermine the United States?
[03:50:01.016 --> 03:50:06.741]  It's a very interesting situation because when you look at foreign intelligence agencies, one of the things they do is they go after the spouses.
[03:50:06.741 --> 03:50:08.102]  The spouses are a link.
[03:50:08.102 --> 03:50:11.785]  That's what Fusion GPS, the Hillary campaign that Deep State was doing in this case.
[03:50:11.785 --> 03:50:16.949]  They were using the spouses and the mistresses to root money to engage in political influence.
[03:50:16.949 --> 03:50:21.853]  So Fusion GPS hired Bruce's wife and that delivered money into the family.
[03:50:21.853 --> 03:50:28.238]  So you had a DOJ official, a top DOJ official, being bribed by the Clinton campaign through multiple layers of separation.
[03:50:28.238 --> 03:50:30.360]  And without this investigation, we wouldn't even know this.
[03:50:31.260 --> 03:50:33.201]  It's just the tip of the iceberg.
[03:50:33.201 --> 03:50:37.142]  But you see this with the two affairs that I mentioned in my article.
[03:50:37.142 --> 03:50:42.204]  James Wolfe and Allie Watkins, who is a New York Times reporter.
[03:50:42.204 --> 03:50:43.984]  We see this with the oars.
[03:50:43.984 --> 03:50:45.785]  We see this with a variety of cases here.
[03:50:46.105 --> 03:50:46.646]  We're good to go.
[03:51:03.104 --> 03:51:07.365]  And this is a very disturbing trend because this is something that foreign intelligence agencies normally do.
[03:51:07.365 --> 03:51:19.988]  And here you have this conglomeration, the Clinton campaign, figures in the media and elsewhere who are actually operating like a foreign intelligence agency on American soil.
[03:51:19.988 --> 03:51:22.868]  Okay, let's take a quick call from a Dean in Niagara Falls.
[03:51:22.868 --> 03:51:24.268]  You had a question about Peter Strzok.
[03:51:24.268 --> 03:51:25.929]  Go ahead for Daniel Greenfield.
[03:51:32.546 --> 03:51:36.710]  Okay, Dean, are you there?
[03:51:36.710 --> 03:51:39.472]  Okay, we're going to move on to the next article.
[03:51:39.472 --> 03:51:46.398]  It's called the Democrat Party Fourth of July Statement, America Sucks.
[03:51:46.398 --> 03:51:49.441]  Thomas Perez wrote, as we celebrate our nation's independence,
[03:51:50.143 --> 03:51:53.745]  We recognize that America's promise remains out of reach.
[03:51:53.745 --> 03:51:59.988]  Women, health care, LGBTQ, people of color, disabilities, inequality, injustice.
[03:51:59.988 --> 03:52:04.730]  Everywhere we look, our fundamental values are under attack.
[03:52:04.730 --> 03:52:06.671]  Daniel, help us out.
[03:52:06.671 --> 03:52:09.012]  Why do Democrats hate America?
[03:52:10.177 --> 03:52:10.917]  Well, think about it.
[03:52:10.917 --> 03:52:12.058]  The Democrats are the left.
[03:52:12.058 --> 03:52:14.398]  What's their whole basis for taking power?
[03:52:14.398 --> 03:52:15.919]  If America is great, we need them.
[03:52:15.919 --> 03:52:17.800]  Who needs this revolution of theirs?
[03:52:17.800 --> 03:52:29.163]  To justify revolution, you have to say everything is horrible, everything is bad, things are miserable, we need to overthrow this murderous system that is just starving babies to death on the border and replace it with us.
[03:52:29.163 --> 03:52:31.244]  So that's their whole concept.
[03:52:31.244 --> 03:52:32.344]  It's their whole worldview.
[03:52:32.344 --> 03:52:33.845]  They have to say that America is terrible.
[03:52:33.845 --> 03:52:36.726]  If they admit that things are good, nobody needs them anymore.
[03:52:36.726 --> 03:52:37.346]  So this is what the left
[03:52:37.466 --> 03:52:41.391]  Always the left says that things are absolutely terrible when we're not in power.
[03:52:41.391 --> 03:52:43.673]  Of course, when they're in power, things are really great.
[03:52:43.673 --> 03:52:45.576]  Just ask the Cubans or the Venezuelans.
[03:52:46.793 --> 03:52:50.916]  Well, look, they compare America to this perfect socialist utopia.
[03:52:50.916 --> 03:52:55.199]  They say it doesn't hold up, so we have to tear it down and start over.
[03:52:55.199 --> 03:53:08.289]  Whereas I think most normal Americans, normal people, look at the rest of the world and we say, well, America has the opportunity, the freedom of religion, as long as the police state isn't trying to tear us down.
[03:53:08.289 --> 03:53:10.050]  And we see America in a completely different
[03:53:10.590 --> 03:53:11.991]  Different light.
[03:53:11.991 --> 03:53:21.595]  When do you think it changed, and how do you think it changed that the Democrat Party became so radicalized that they're now calling for literally open revolution?
[03:53:21.595 --> 03:53:27.718]  Well, you know, back in the day, the Democrats stood for a lot of the things the Republicans stand now, at least officially.
[03:53:27.718 --> 03:53:29.779]  They were the states' rights party back in the day.
[03:53:29.779 --> 03:53:33.360]  Then they were taken over by the left, and there was a huge shift when that happened.
[03:53:33.360 --> 03:53:35.821]  The Democrats used to be a kind of a farmer's party.
[03:53:35.821 --> 03:53:39.143]  They used to be a party of people who had been overlooked.
[03:53:39.823 --> 03:53:46.787]  That's the image they still want, but in practice what happened was that they were taken over by powerful left-wing elites, particularly in urban areas.
[03:53:46.787 --> 03:53:50.669]  These elites disguised the takeover by enlisting minorities.
[03:53:50.669 --> 03:53:59.834]  They created political plantations for black people, for various other minority groups, and that way they could still claim to represent the oppressed, but in practice what they did was represent a small
[03:54:00.314 --> 03:54:00.614]  We're good.
[03:54:19.935 --> 03:54:27.600]  Well, you're kind of echoing some of the points in my films that the radicals in the 60s were calling for open revolution.
[03:54:27.600 --> 03:54:32.182]  They bombed police stations, bombed government buildings, went to jail.
[03:54:32.182 --> 03:54:34.424]  It was so evil, nobody followed them.
[03:54:34.424 --> 03:54:41.848]  And when they came out of the underground in the early 80s, they taught the young radicals like Barack Obama, don't tell people about your Marxism, keep it to yourself.
[03:54:42.652 --> 03:54:47.994]  And take power, and then you'll throw everyone under the bus at a later stage.
[03:54:47.994 --> 03:54:54.277]  But now it seems that they're openly calling for the open revolution as they did back in the 60s.
[03:54:54.277 --> 03:54:54.797]  Let's go ahead.
[03:54:54.797 --> 03:54:57.698]  I think we do have Dean back on the line from Texas.
[03:54:57.698 --> 03:55:00.939]  Go ahead, Dean.
[03:55:00.939 --> 03:55:01.319]  Hey, Joe.
[03:55:01.319 --> 03:55:02.600]  How are you doing, bud?
[03:55:02.600 --> 03:55:05.321]  I want to appreciate the work that you do, man.
[03:55:05.321 --> 03:55:06.381]  Let me tell you.
[03:55:06.381 --> 03:55:08.162]  It's about research.
[03:55:08.162 --> 03:55:08.742]  Thank you.
[03:55:08.742 --> 03:55:09.502]  Go ahead with the question.
[03:55:11.864 --> 03:55:15.347]  The Peter Strzok testimony yesterday.
[03:55:15.347 --> 03:55:25.454]  Now, we obviously see the hand that the left is doing, whether it be interrupting the congressman and their question and stuff like that.
[03:55:27.091 --> 03:55:30.492]  Okay, where do we go forward from this now?
[03:55:30.492 --> 03:55:32.252]  Okay, thank you for the call.
[03:55:32.252 --> 03:55:38.314]  Daniel Greenfield, you saw the spectacle on the Peter Strzok testimony.
[03:55:38.314 --> 03:55:43.295]  You saw the Democrats cheering, offering him a purple heart.
[03:55:43.295 --> 03:55:51.217]  What are the dynamics that you saw going on and what's next for either the Russia investigation or the Spygate investigation?
[03:55:52.412 --> 03:55:58.356]  Well, Congress has a limited amount of power, especially with Republican leadership in the hands of Paul Ryan.
[03:55:58.356 --> 03:56:09.064]  So what they can do is ask questions, they can subpoena documents, and though it's going to be stonewalled by the DOJ, which is what we're seeing, and they can keep the focus on it, but in practice they have only so much power.
[03:56:09.064 --> 03:56:12.126]  Their greatest thing that Congress can do is actually extract information.
[03:56:12.846 --> 03:56:21.115]  The real power is in the hands of the DOJ, unfortunately, and the DOJ is currently being run by people who have absolutely no interest in further uncovering the investigation.
[03:56:21.115 --> 03:56:24.278]  President Trump has a great deal of power to declassify information.
[03:56:24.278 --> 03:56:29.584]  He hasn't really properly unleashed it yet, in part because the infrastructure is so basically flawed.
[03:56:29.584 --> 03:56:33.828]  But as we continue unrolling this investigation, we're constantly learning new and important things.
[03:56:34.168 --> 03:56:40.532]  And it's a process, it's a process that makes people very understandably impatient, because ultimately it's a lawyerism.
[03:56:40.532 --> 03:56:52.820]  You're getting new facts, you're pulling out more documents, you're getting more testimony, you're getting more pieces of the puzzle put together, and it's a slow going process, but at the same time the things we're discussing on the show, the things we just discussed in these segments,
[03:56:53.300 --> 03:56:53.661]  Thank you.
[03:57:13.556 --> 03:57:15.678]  Okay, well, I sure appreciate your time.
