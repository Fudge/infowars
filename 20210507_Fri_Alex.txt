[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  ["Pomp and Circumstance"]
[00:30.000 --> 00:39.000]  ["Pomp and Circumstance"]
[00:39.000 --> 00:43.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is a very important transmission.
[00:43.000 --> 00:46.000]  We are very, very honored to have you here joining us.
[00:46.000 --> 00:51.000]  We're going to be broadcasting for the next four hours
[00:51.000 --> 00:55.000]  on this very important transmission.
[00:55.000 --> 00:58.000]  I've got news of such massive import
[00:58.000 --> 01:01.000]  that we're just going to go to the special report here in a moment
[01:01.000 --> 01:04.000]  and then come back and launch all of this.
[01:04.000 --> 01:06.000]  But more information today is coming out now
[01:06.000 --> 01:08.000]  about how deadly these franken shots are
[01:08.000 --> 01:10.000]  than came out in the previous six months.
[01:10.000 --> 01:12.000]  A real quickening is here.
[01:12.000 --> 01:15.000]  They've activated antivitera groups all over the world,
[01:15.000 --> 01:16.000]  not just here.
[01:16.000 --> 01:19.000]  Massive inflation is now proven to be coming
[01:19.000 --> 01:23.000]  and to be intensifying, and so much more.
[01:23.000 --> 01:25.000]  But if we're aware of the enemy attacks
[01:25.000 --> 01:27.000]  and if we reach out to each other, we can stop it.
[01:27.000 --> 01:29.000]  Here is Darren McBrane's latest report
[01:29.000 --> 01:33.000]  on the incredible thought police launching total tyranny
[01:33.000 --> 01:36.000]  here in the U.S. and across the world.
[01:36.000 --> 01:39.000]  And after the growing number of hoaxes popping up online,
[01:39.000 --> 01:41.000]  misinformation is spreading fast.
[01:41.000 --> 01:45.000]  The coronavirus has created a perfect storm for conspiracy theories.
[01:45.000 --> 01:48.000]  If you go online, there's no shortage of conspiracy theories.
[01:48.000 --> 01:52.000]  There have been a growing number of anti-vaccination conspiracy theories online.
[01:52.000 --> 01:55.000]  There's been a wave of misinformation.
[01:55.000 --> 01:58.000]  The Internet has lit up with misinformation spreading nearly as fast
[01:58.000 --> 02:00.000]  as the virus itself.
[02:00.000 --> 02:04.000]  Religious-based conspiracy theories surrounding the vaccinations
[02:04.000 --> 02:06.000]  are exploding on social media.
[02:06.000 --> 02:10.000]  Wasn't Facebook supposed to take care of anti-vaxxer kind of groups
[02:10.000 --> 02:12.000]  before COVID-19?
[02:12.000 --> 02:14.000]  Why is it still popping up and where's it coming from?
[02:14.000 --> 02:19.000]  Why is this type of information so difficult to police?
[02:19.000 --> 02:21.000]  In general, what we found in a bunch of studies
[02:21.000 --> 02:25.000]  is that most of the people who believe false news stories
[02:25.000 --> 02:28.000]  do so because they're just not thinking deeply
[02:28.000 --> 02:31.000]  about whether what they're reading is true or false.
[02:31.000 --> 02:35.000]  Social media platforms have been able to ban a lot of this content,
[02:35.000 --> 02:39.000]  but it's become increasingly more difficult to enforce.
[02:39.000 --> 02:43.000]  I know Internet companies are looking at this.
[02:43.000 --> 02:47.000]  Do you wish that they would play a role in taking stuff down,
[02:47.000 --> 02:49.000]  which is as demonstrably false?
[02:49.000 --> 02:53.000]  Yeah, in some cases they are taking things down.
[02:53.000 --> 02:56.000]  We're hunting for COVID conspiracy theories.
[02:56.000 --> 02:59.000]  We report over 800 pieces of misinformation.
[02:59.000 --> 03:02.000]  It's stuff that's sort of on the cusp, like conspiracy theories
[03:02.000 --> 03:07.000]  that could spread sort of propaganda or maybe harmful health misinformation.
[03:07.000 --> 03:10.000]  If you're a healthy person and you're exercising all the time
[03:10.000 --> 03:12.000]  and you're young and you're eating well,
[03:12.000 --> 03:15.000]  I don't think you need to worry about this.
[03:15.000 --> 03:17.000]  Dangerous misinformation.
[03:17.000 --> 03:19.000]  Let's report it.
[03:19.000 --> 03:23.000]  A video making the same false claim was widely circulated on Facebook.
[03:23.000 --> 03:26.000]  It was tagged with a fact check that it's false.
[03:26.000 --> 03:28.000]  Vaccines are inherently dangerous.
[03:28.000 --> 03:29.000]  Swag it.
[03:29.000 --> 03:30.000]  False information.
[03:30.000 --> 03:32.000]  I'm going to report this.
[03:32.000 --> 03:33.000]  You know it's false.
[03:33.000 --> 03:34.000]  It's false, yeah.
[03:34.000 --> 03:36.000]  And as bad as the global censorship is,
[03:36.000 --> 03:38.000]  and as much as they've been suppressing
[03:38.000 --> 03:41.000]  thousands of medical doctors and nurses here in the U.S. alone
[03:41.000 --> 03:43.000]  talking about around the world,
[03:43.000 --> 03:45.000]  the truth about COVID-19 is coming out.
[03:45.000 --> 03:48.000]  The truth about the vaccines not being vaccines, not protecting us.
[03:48.000 --> 03:50.000]  The truth about the PCR test being fake is coming out.
[03:50.000 --> 03:53.000]  The truth about Bill Gates being behind all the companies is coming out.
[03:53.000 --> 03:56.000]  The fact that the Pfizer and the Moderna and the AstraZeneca
[03:56.000 --> 03:58.000]  and the Australian government vaccine
[03:58.000 --> 04:01.000]  and a whole bunch of others have been banned in Australia and South Africa
[04:01.000 --> 04:04.000]  and 21 countries in Europe and the Philippines and Russia.
[04:04.000 --> 04:08.000]  There is absolutely no evidence for credible studies
[04:08.000 --> 04:11.000]  supporting any of what he just said.
[04:11.000 --> 04:13.000]  I know my husband is not vaccinating people
[04:13.000 --> 04:15.000]  and not putting a microchip in their arms.
[04:15.000 --> 04:17.000]  That technology doesn't even exist
[04:17.000 --> 04:20.000]  and he's never uttered the words out of his mouth.
[04:20.000 --> 04:22.000]  Forget the conspiracy.
[04:22.000 --> 04:24.000]  Listen to our government agencies.
[04:24.000 --> 04:26.000]  These guys are telling the truth.
[04:26.000 --> 04:28.000]  You know, there's no conspiracy here, folks.
[04:28.000 --> 04:30.000]  Just get your damn vaccine.
[04:30.000 --> 04:32.000]  I'm not asking what's in the infusion.
[04:32.000 --> 04:37.000]  I'm not looking up all of the ingredients in the infusion.
[04:37.000 --> 04:42.000]  I am sticking out my arm and I am taking the infusion.
[04:42.000 --> 04:44.000]  We've got to shun folks.
[04:44.000 --> 04:47.000]  We've got to shun people into getting vaccinated.
[04:47.000 --> 04:51.000]  We need to shun those that refuse to get vaccinated.
[04:51.000 --> 04:53.000]  We must take the vaccine.
[04:53.000 --> 04:57.000]  Put them on a bus and bring them to a mass vaccination center.
[04:57.000 --> 04:58.000]  Woman.
[04:58.000 --> 05:01.000]  Listeners have rightfully been complaining
[05:01.000 --> 05:03.000]  the last six months or so saying,
[05:03.000 --> 05:07.000]  where are most of the best-selling products you have that we love?
[05:07.000 --> 05:09.000]  And my answer is the supply chain has broken down.
[05:09.000 --> 05:12.000]  I have to either reformulate or I have to lower the quality
[05:12.000 --> 05:13.000]  to get a lot of these.
[05:13.000 --> 05:15.000]  And so that's why we don't have a lot of products in.
[05:15.000 --> 05:17.000]  That's why Info Wars is in financial trouble,
[05:17.000 --> 05:20.000]  is because if we had the product, you would be buying it.
[05:20.000 --> 05:21.000]  We'd have the money.
[05:21.000 --> 05:23.000]  But so many of them have been sold out.
[05:23.000 --> 05:25.000]  Just like you notice, a lot of other items at the store
[05:25.000 --> 05:28.000]  aren't available because civilization is being artificially imploded.
[05:28.000 --> 05:32.000]  But finally, X2 is back in stock with a good halogen.
[05:32.000 --> 05:34.000]  Deep Earth Crystal iodide.
[05:34.000 --> 05:35.000]  So essential in your body.
[05:35.000 --> 05:37.000]  It's really the missing link.
[05:37.000 --> 05:39.000]  It's 50% off.
[05:39.000 --> 05:41.000]  We've got a big shipment of it at infowarstore.com.
[05:41.000 --> 05:42.000]  Now, when it gets ready to sell out,
[05:42.000 --> 05:44.000]  we'll have to go back to near full price,
[05:44.000 --> 05:46.000]  taking marriage with us now, stock up.
[05:46.000 --> 05:48.000]  And don't forget to take your X2 because I have a tendency
[05:48.000 --> 05:51.000]  to forget how great it is and not take it myself.
[05:51.000 --> 05:54.000]  But when I do, stamina, libido, energy, weight loss,
[05:54.000 --> 05:55.000]  it's incredible.
[05:55.000 --> 05:56.000]  It's essential.
[05:56.000 --> 06:14.000]  It's X2 at infowarstore.com.
[06:14.000 --> 06:30.000]  Tomorrow's news today.
[06:30.000 --> 06:33.000]  From the front lines of the information war,
[06:33.000 --> 06:40.000]  it's Alex Jones.
[06:40.000 --> 06:44.000]  It's Friday, May 7th, the year is 2021.
[06:44.000 --> 06:45.000]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[06:45.000 --> 06:49.000]  I'm going to be hosting all four hours of my broadcast today.
[06:49.000 --> 06:53.000]  Then the War Room with Owen Troyer is coming up, 3 p.m. central.
[06:53.000 --> 06:55.000]  I'll be back this Sunday.
[06:55.000 --> 06:58.000]  I'm going to host the Alex Jones Sunday show that I've been doing
[06:58.000 --> 06:59.000]  for 15 years.
[06:59.000 --> 07:03.000]  And then I'm going to host a Sunday Live that Owen's been doing
[07:03.000 --> 07:06.000]  for the last six months or so until eight o'clock.
[07:06.000 --> 07:10.000]  So I'll do four hours of live radio.
[07:10.000 --> 07:13.000]  And we're going to open the phones up the entire time and take
[07:13.000 --> 07:17.000]  calls for the general public to tell their stories of what
[07:17.000 --> 07:20.000]  happened when they took the vaccine or their family took it.
[07:20.000 --> 07:23.000]  Or if you're a nursing home worker or a doctor or a nurse or a
[07:23.000 --> 07:28.000]  lawyer representing people, you really need a place to speak
[07:28.000 --> 07:29.000]  because you're being censored.
[07:29.000 --> 07:30.000]  You're being blocked.
[07:30.000 --> 07:35.000]  You're being silenced all over the world.
[07:35.000 --> 07:36.000]  Not just here.
[07:36.000 --> 07:39.000]  And then there's a lot of preparation for this.
[07:39.000 --> 07:41.000]  I'm going to do the best job I can.
[07:41.000 --> 07:50.000]  Next hour, we have antifa attacks in Madrid, Spain, antifa attacks
[07:50.000 --> 07:55.000]  in the United Kingdom, antifa attacks in New York, antifa attacks
[07:55.000 --> 08:00.000]  in Florida, antifa attacks in Portland, Oregon, Seattle,
[08:00.000 --> 08:07.000]  Washington, San Diego, California, brutal video in Portland of
[08:07.000 --> 08:19.000]  hundreds of antifa with M4 rifles coming up and pointing guns at
[08:19.000 --> 08:22.000]  people in their cars saying, I'll shoot you.
[08:22.000 --> 08:23.000]  I'll kill you.
[08:23.000 --> 08:27.000]  Robbing their cars and beating people up.
[08:27.000 --> 08:32.000]  And the police do absolutely nothing.
[08:32.000 --> 08:34.000]  This is Bolshevik level.
[08:34.000 --> 08:35.000]  They pull the man out.
[08:35.000 --> 08:36.000]  They beat him up.
[08:36.000 --> 08:39.000]  They attack people in front of a school bus.
[08:39.000 --> 08:43.000]  And the police do nothing.
[08:43.000 --> 08:44.000]  So there you go.
[08:44.000 --> 08:46.000]  The police are a political organization in this country.
[08:46.000 --> 08:49.000]  They're nothing but the largest street gang in the country.
[08:49.000 --> 08:51.000]  And when they work for us and the Bill of Rights and
[08:51.000 --> 08:53.000]  Constitution, they can be a positive force.
[08:53.000 --> 08:57.000]  But in most places like Guatemala or Cuba or North Korea or
[08:57.000 --> 09:00.000]  China, we know the police are bad, right?
[09:00.000 --> 09:01.000]  They are.
[09:01.000 --> 09:02.000]  They're authoritarians.
[09:02.000 --> 09:06.000]  So just like that, it's who controls them and the type of men
[09:06.000 --> 09:09.000]  and women that work in them because they know you defend a
[09:09.000 --> 09:13.000]  citizen, you go to jail, you end up like Derek Chauvin.
[09:13.000 --> 09:16.000]  And speaking of that, that's also coming up next hour.
[09:16.000 --> 09:22.000]  Derek Chauvin and three other former police indicted by
[09:22.000 --> 09:26.000]  civil rights charges in the depth of George Floyd.
[09:26.000 --> 09:30.000]  And it's the Clintons and Obama that basically run the
[09:30.000 --> 09:32.000]  Biden puppet administration.
[09:32.000 --> 09:36.000]  And isn't it interesting that, oh, nobody got in trouble for
[09:36.000 --> 09:37.000]  Waco.
[09:37.000 --> 09:40.000]  Nobody gets in trouble for drone attacks that kill 50 innocent
[09:40.000 --> 09:43.000]  people at a wedding that kill one, quote, bad guy.
[09:43.000 --> 09:46.000]  And Obama says, I'm really good at killing people.
[09:46.000 --> 09:49.000]  And the Arab Spring that killed millions that Obama and Hillary
[09:49.000 --> 09:52.000]  launched and destroying Libya, you name it, or the Clintons
[09:52.000 --> 09:56.000]  running the Hutu murders and the Tutsis in Rwanda.
[09:56.000 --> 09:57.000]  Oh, no.
[09:57.000 --> 10:01.000]  The cop that leaned on the guy dying of a heart attack from
[10:01.000 --> 10:04.000]  fentanyl, he's now been sentenced in a kangaroo court by a
[10:04.000 --> 10:07.000]  Black Lives Matter members that wore their Black Lives Matter
[10:07.000 --> 10:11.000]  t-shirts and bragged they were kind of convicting but lied to
[10:11.000 --> 10:15.000]  the court.
[10:15.000 --> 10:21.000]  Well, don't worry, now our new attorney general is going to
[10:21.000 --> 10:25.000]  show the world how good he is with more charges and more
[10:25.000 --> 10:28.000]  kangaroo trials because the feds are a bunch of virtue
[10:28.000 --> 10:29.000]  signalers.
[10:29.000 --> 10:33.000]  Virtuous signaling and leftist propaganda is the CIA, the FBI,
[10:33.000 --> 10:34.000]  the whole government.
[10:34.000 --> 10:36.000]  It's how the multinational corporations cover up for their
[10:36.000 --> 10:40.000]  crimes running death camps in China like big tech does.
[10:40.000 --> 10:43.000]  And then teaching us our cities must burn because a few cops
[10:43.000 --> 10:46.000]  might have done something wrong and ignoring all the rest of the
[10:46.000 --> 10:47.000]  mass death.
[10:47.000 --> 10:52.000]  It is a coordinated plan but just chilling footage of
[10:52.000 --> 10:55.000]  Antifa burning down more police stations, more buildings
[10:55.000 --> 10:58.000]  and then saying we're going to do a lot more.
[10:58.000 --> 11:02.000]  They are the foot soldiers of Congress, of CNN that calls them
[11:02.000 --> 11:06.000]  heroes and calls them anti-fascists except when they do
[11:06.000 --> 11:10.000]  something bad, oh, then they don't exist.
[11:10.000 --> 11:13.000]  That's more gaslighting.
[11:13.000 --> 11:17.000]  So I've got this huge stack of important news and all the
[11:17.000 --> 11:19.000]  Antifa footage and the rest of it.
[11:19.000 --> 11:22.000]  We're going to be going bombs going off from the Islamists
[11:22.000 --> 11:23.000]  all over Sweden.
[11:23.000 --> 11:26.000]  Let's not even the news now because, again, when a Muslim blows
[11:26.000 --> 11:30.000]  something up or stabs somebody to death, it's not Islam.
[11:30.000 --> 11:33.000]  But we've got a bunch of footage of black people stabbing
[11:33.000 --> 11:37.000]  and beating Asians over the head with bricks and the news says
[11:37.000 --> 11:39.000]  more Asian white supremacists attacks.
[11:39.000 --> 11:43.000]  They actually say white supremacism, record highs, attacks on
[11:43.000 --> 11:46.000]  Asians, totally delusional, FBI says number one threat, white
[11:46.000 --> 11:48.000]  supremacist attacks on Asians.
[11:48.000 --> 11:52.000]  It doesn't even exist other than one crazy pervert that went
[11:52.000 --> 11:56.000]  and shot women he was mad at because he'd given them all his
[11:56.000 --> 11:59.000]  paychecks, paying for hand jobs.
[11:59.000 --> 12:03.000]  Again, you can see on screen a brutal white supremacist, he
[12:03.000 --> 12:05.000]  happens to have black skin, beating.
[12:05.000 --> 12:08.000]  He's wearing his mask though so it's okay.
[12:08.000 --> 12:12.000]  Beating them with a brick for no reason, but that's okay
[12:12.000 --> 12:14.000]  because he's white.
[12:14.000 --> 12:15.000]  He's a white supremacist.
[12:15.000 --> 12:17.000]  I mean, actually he's black, but really don't tell the
[12:17.000 --> 12:21.000]  don't tell the never time.
[12:21.000 --> 12:29.000]  So that's all coming up as I told you in the second hour.
[12:29.000 --> 12:35.000]  Now, the first thing I want to get to is the big issue overall.
[12:35.000 --> 12:38.000]  And of course there's force inoculation, the fact that the
[12:38.000 --> 12:44.000]  injections are killing people and the fact that the University
[12:44.000 --> 12:48.000]  of Texas knew nine years ago that they tested three COVID
[12:48.000 --> 12:52.000]  vaccines and it killed the mice that were given the shot,
[12:52.000 --> 12:56.000]  causing blood clots because the body starts eating holes in
[12:56.000 --> 13:00.000]  itself, particularly the lungs.
[13:00.000 --> 13:03.000]  We're going to get to all that too and I'm going to open the
[13:03.000 --> 13:05.000]  phones up.
[13:05.000 --> 13:07.000]  We're first going to call back folks that were on the line
[13:07.000 --> 13:09.000]  yesterday that I didn't get to.
[13:09.000 --> 13:11.000]  We're going to open the phones up again for people to tell
[13:11.000 --> 13:14.000]  their testimony about whether they love the vaccine or had no
[13:14.000 --> 13:17.000]  problem with it or whether it was detrimental.
[13:17.000 --> 13:21.000]  You're chance unfiltered to be on air with us.
[13:21.000 --> 13:23.000]  We don't screen your calls other than to make sure you're on
[13:23.000 --> 13:26.000]  topic and that you've got a good telephone.
[13:26.000 --> 13:28.000]  And boy, there's been big developments.
[13:28.000 --> 13:31.000]  China's top health authority urges halt to compulsory
[13:31.000 --> 13:36.000]  vaccination stresses voluntary free inoculation as in the
[13:36.000 --> 13:41.000]  West they push forced inoculation and bullied inoculation.
[13:41.000 --> 13:44.000]  That is all coming up as well.
[13:44.000 --> 13:49.000]  So we've got that and all the massive race war news coming up
[13:49.000 --> 13:54.000]  as well because all this is a multi-pronged attack.
[13:54.000 --> 13:57.000]  You've got the race riots that cover up the economic collapse
[13:57.000 --> 14:00.000]  that's coming from inflation but those are two weapons against
[14:00.000 --> 14:02.000]  the general public but they want to have us fighting while
[14:02.000 --> 14:04.000]  they do it.
[14:04.000 --> 14:06.000]  Then you've got the whole COVID lockdown that's causing the
[14:06.000 --> 14:09.000]  worldwide starvation and the collapse itself and the police
[14:09.000 --> 14:12.000]  state and the overarching system that comes with that that the
[14:12.000 --> 14:15.000]  media praises when police beat up black people, white people,
[14:15.000 --> 14:18.000]  it doesn't matter for not wearing their mask or not
[14:18.000 --> 14:21.000]  quarantining or having a church service.
[14:21.000 --> 14:24.000]  And then of course you've got the spiritual prong attack,
[14:24.000 --> 14:27.000]  all the Satanism and occultism being promoted.
[14:27.000 --> 14:30.000]  And with that all the gaslighting by design.
[14:30.000 --> 14:32.000]  Oh aunty if it doesn't exist.
[14:32.000 --> 14:35.000]  Oh loving capitalism is white supremacist.
[14:35.000 --> 14:37.000]  Martin Luther King was a racist.
[14:37.000 --> 14:40.000]  He's with the white supremacist actually say that now.
[14:40.000 --> 14:45.000]  And oh abortion is good for children says AOC.
[14:45.000 --> 14:49.000]  Planned Parenthood is a pro-life organization.
[14:49.000 --> 14:51.000]  Killing babies is pro-life.
[14:51.000 --> 14:54.000]  AOC calls herself a Planned Parenthood baby.
[14:54.000 --> 14:58.000]  We've also got a bunch of new crazy pronouns where they're
[14:58.000 --> 15:03.000]  calling people to have a baby birthing individuals.
[15:03.000 --> 15:08.000]  So more, more bizarre takeover like space aliens have landed.
[15:08.000 --> 15:13.000]  That is all coming up today.
[15:13.000 --> 15:17.000]  And you also have Biden's DOJ demands access to
[15:17.000 --> 15:19.000]  Arizona election audit.
[15:19.000 --> 15:21.000]  They're trying to block that now because the audit obviously
[15:21.000 --> 15:24.000]  is finding massive evidence of no signatures on a lot of these
[15:24.000 --> 15:25.000]  mail-in ballots.
[15:25.000 --> 15:27.000]  Total fraud, ladies and gentlemen.
[15:27.000 --> 15:29.000]  People voting two or three times.
[15:29.000 --> 15:31.000]  Oh yes, they're really upset.
[15:31.000 --> 15:32.000]  They're really worried.
[15:32.000 --> 15:36.000]  But the first big news is the economy and the inflation that
[15:36.000 --> 15:39.000]  they cannot hide and just how bad that's going to be.
[15:39.000 --> 15:41.000]  I've got a very clear image on exactly how this is going to
[15:41.000 --> 15:44.000]  unfold, how they're going to try to manage this inflation.
[15:44.000 --> 15:46.000]  But it's not going to work on the other side.
[15:46.000 --> 15:48.000]  So brace yourself for that.
[15:48.000 --> 15:53.000]  I'm Alex Jones. It's Friday, May 7th. The year is 2021
[15:53.000 --> 15:55.000]  in FullWars.com.
[15:55.000 --> 15:58.000]  Tomorrow's News Today.
[15:58.000 --> 16:01.000]  One of the most popular memes on the Internet in the last
[16:01.000 --> 16:03.000]  decade has been Alex Jones was right.
[16:03.000 --> 16:08.000]  But it now routinely trends number one on platforms like
[16:08.000 --> 16:11.000]  Twitter and Facebook making the globalists pull their
[16:11.000 --> 16:12.000]  hair out in anger.
[16:12.000 --> 16:15.000]  But let me tell you, we are Tomorrow's News Today.
[16:15.000 --> 16:18.000]  Thanks for your support. We're still on air at
[16:18.000 --> 16:20.000]  FullWars.com and band.video for radio stations and TV stations
[16:20.000 --> 16:21.000]  across the country.
[16:21.000 --> 16:23.000]  And our film Endgame, censored and taken off line by
[16:23.000 --> 16:26.000]  Amazon when it hit number one a few years ago, is now
[16:26.000 --> 16:27.000]  available again.
[16:27.000 --> 16:29.000]  We have reprinted it on high quality DVD.
[16:29.000 --> 16:31.000]  In HD, it has a zero country code.
[16:31.000 --> 16:34.000]  Anyone in the world is authorized to make copies of it.
[16:34.000 --> 16:36.000]  And I'm asking you to get the original, make copies,
[16:36.000 --> 16:37.000]  give it to everyone you know.
[16:37.000 --> 16:39.000]  Get it on local access TV, give it to your pastors,
[16:39.000 --> 16:41.000]  your police chiefs, your state reps, your prime ministers,
[16:41.000 --> 16:43.000]  whatever you do, warn the world.
[16:43.000 --> 16:45.000]  This film uses their own documents and own statements.
[16:45.000 --> 16:47.000]  14 years ago to expose them.
[16:47.000 --> 16:49.000]  It's more important than ever.
[16:49.000 --> 16:51.000]  Available at infowarsstore.com.
[16:51.000 --> 16:52.000]  That's infowarsstore.com.
[16:52.000 --> 16:54.000]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[16:54.000 --> 17:01.000]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021.
[17:01.000 --> 17:02.000]  And I just want to say something.
[17:02.000 --> 17:05.000]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew
[17:05.000 --> 17:07.000]  that has come together over the years.
[17:07.000 --> 17:08.000]  And it's truly an answer to prayer.
[17:08.000 --> 17:11.000]  And I am so blessed and thankful for all of you,
[17:11.000 --> 17:13.000]  the listeners of this show.
[17:13.000 --> 17:15.000]  I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you,
[17:15.000 --> 17:17.000]  whether you are old, whether you are sparse.
[17:17.000 --> 17:19.000]  We'll drop the report. Let's take a listen.
[17:19.000 --> 17:22.000]  We never thought that after the first 50 or 60 days,
[17:22.000 --> 17:23.000]  every...
[17:23.000 --> 17:26.000]  Children, we are brothers and sisters together.
[17:26.000 --> 17:28.000]  And it has just been an incredible experience
[17:28.000 --> 17:30.000]  to work with you over the years.
[17:30.000 --> 17:32.000]  And as crazy as things are,
[17:32.000 --> 17:34.000]  I want to keep working under the future.
[17:34.000 --> 17:37.000]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[17:37.000 --> 17:39.000]  So please, I hope God works through you
[17:39.000 --> 17:42.000]  and puts a message in your heart to support us.
[17:42.000 --> 17:44.000]  But again, that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[17:44.000 --> 17:47.000]  I just want to thank you all for the years of support
[17:47.000 --> 17:48.000]  you've given us and what you've done.
[17:48.000 --> 17:50.000]  And just ask you again to pray to God
[17:50.000 --> 17:52.000]  and ask what God's vision is for you.
[17:52.000 --> 17:54.000]  And hopefully God will touch your heart
[17:54.000 --> 17:56.000]  to continue to support him for worse.
[17:56.000 --> 18:22.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[18:22.000 --> 18:32.000]  Welcome back to the most outlaw radio broadcast on the planet.
[18:32.000 --> 18:36.000]  A lot of folks like to dress up in leather outfits
[18:36.000 --> 18:38.000]  and ride around on their motorcycles
[18:38.000 --> 18:40.000]  and tell everybody how they're big outlaws.
[18:40.000 --> 18:42.000]  A lot of guys like to get into jiu-jitsu
[18:42.000 --> 18:44.000]  and, you know, get in great shape
[18:44.000 --> 18:45.000]  and learn how to fight really well.
[18:45.000 --> 18:46.000]  And that's great.
[18:46.000 --> 18:47.000]  I think that's fine.
[18:47.000 --> 18:49.000]  In fact, I like all that
[18:49.000 --> 18:51.000]  because we need to be extremely male
[18:51.000 --> 18:54.000]  in a society trying to tell us to be
[18:54.000 --> 18:56.000]  little passive slaves of the system.
[18:56.000 --> 19:00.000]  But I really like to see all the tough guy men out there
[19:00.000 --> 19:03.000]  spend a little less time hanging out with other dudes,
[19:03.000 --> 19:05.000]  acting tough,
[19:05.000 --> 19:08.000]  and a little more time being politically engaged.
[19:08.000 --> 19:10.000]  Now, I know when you do that,
[19:10.000 --> 19:13.000]  you get put in prison like the Proud Boys.
[19:13.000 --> 19:15.000]  Or you get attacked like Info Wars.
[19:15.000 --> 19:19.000]  But I really need all those tough guys
[19:19.000 --> 19:20.000]  to get engaged.
[19:20.000 --> 19:21.000]  I know Rolling Thunders,
[19:21.000 --> 19:23.000]  a lot of great veterans and patriots,
[19:23.000 --> 19:24.000]  like their fun motorcycles.
[19:24.000 --> 19:25.000]  Motorcycles are awesome.
[19:25.000 --> 19:26.000]  Probably nothing funner out there
[19:26.000 --> 19:30.000]  other than what's Wayland Jennings say.
[19:30.000 --> 19:34.000]  Guitar's a tomb good firm, feeling women.
[19:34.000 --> 19:37.000]  But the Pentagon said,
[19:37.000 --> 19:39.000]  you're not welcome here, Rolling Thunder, this year.
[19:39.000 --> 19:42.000]  That's because our country's been taken over
[19:42.000 --> 19:44.000]  by the Chai comms and the globalists.
[19:44.000 --> 19:46.000]  And it really is happening.
[19:46.000 --> 19:48.000]  And they really are destabilizing the country.
[19:48.000 --> 19:52.000]  And they're going to mask the coming economic collapse
[19:52.000 --> 19:57.000]  that's already begun
[19:57.000 --> 20:00.000]  with racial riots this summer
[20:00.000 --> 20:04.000]  that are going to really make even the burning down of Detroit
[20:04.000 --> 20:08.000]  and other cities in the 1960s pale in significance.
[20:08.000 --> 20:10.000]  And I'll be covering that, as I said, next hour.
[20:10.000 --> 20:16.000]  But as we speak of the puppet president
[20:16.000 --> 20:20.000]  of the O'Harris administration,
[20:20.000 --> 20:21.000]  it really is Obama
[20:21.000 --> 20:23.000]  and then their puppet Harris, Biden,
[20:23.000 --> 20:25.000]  came right off a teleprompter most of the time now
[20:25.000 --> 20:27.000]  unless he's carefully hopped up
[20:27.000 --> 20:30.000]  on the infetamines in the morning.
[20:30.000 --> 20:31.000]  And he's saying,
[20:31.000 --> 20:34.000]  oh, I didn't think we'd turn things around from COVID
[20:34.000 --> 20:35.000]  and the economy right away.
[20:35.000 --> 20:37.000]  That's why we need more stimulus.
[20:37.000 --> 20:39.000]  In fact, as soon as I heard he was giving a speech 10 minutes ago,
[20:39.000 --> 20:41.000]  I said, let me guess in the transcript,
[20:41.000 --> 20:43.000]  he'll say the answer is more stimulus.
[20:43.000 --> 20:45.000]  Well, no, that's why people won't go to work
[20:45.000 --> 20:46.000]  because they're getting a check.
[20:46.000 --> 20:47.000]  They go buy things,
[20:47.000 --> 20:49.000]  and then that makes prices go up
[20:49.000 --> 20:51.000]  and scarce commodities
[20:51.000 --> 20:55.000]  because no one is growing the crops
[20:55.000 --> 20:57.000]  or delivering the cattle to slaughter
[20:57.000 --> 20:59.000]  or building the microchips
[20:59.000 --> 21:01.000]  or cutting down the timber
[21:01.000 --> 21:03.000]  or growing the corn or smelting the steel.
[21:03.000 --> 21:06.000]  That's why steel tripled in prices the last few months.
[21:06.000 --> 21:08.000]  That's why corn's up 80% in the last few months.
[21:08.000 --> 21:09.000]  Set to triple.
[21:09.000 --> 21:12.000]  That's why food prices are set to be up 76%
[21:12.000 --> 21:13.000]  by the end of summer.
[21:13.000 --> 21:16.000]  Current purchases around the world of crops going in.
[21:16.000 --> 21:17.000]  There's such a scarcity.
[21:17.000 --> 21:20.000]  People are buying the crops before they're even planted.
[21:22.000 --> 21:24.000]  And I've got all that data here.
[21:24.000 --> 21:25.000]  I told you last year
[21:25.000 --> 21:28.000]  when the first world collapses, the third world dies.
[21:28.000 --> 21:31.000]  Then the UN will organize that giant third world collapse
[21:31.000 --> 21:33.000]  to break our borders, to flood us,
[21:33.000 --> 21:35.000]  and they'll have a giant underclass permanently controlled,
[21:35.000 --> 21:37.000]  and that's in the globalist documents.
[21:37.000 --> 21:39.000]  People keep asking how I predict everything.
[21:39.000 --> 21:40.000]  It's all there.
[21:40.000 --> 21:42.000]  They create crises,
[21:42.000 --> 21:45.000]  offer a solution that creates a bigger crisis
[21:45.000 --> 21:46.000]  that gives them more power,
[21:46.000 --> 21:50.000]  and they repeat it over and over and over and over again.
[21:51.000 --> 21:53.000]  And they use the Galilean dialectic where
[21:56.000 --> 21:59.000]  one leftist calls for sterilizing all boys at birth.
[21:59.000 --> 22:02.000]  They're actually doing that in academic circles.
[22:02.000 --> 22:03.000]  And then Caitlyn Jenner says,
[22:03.000 --> 22:05.000]  oh no, let's sterilize the boys,
[22:05.000 --> 22:11.000]  but let biological girls only compete with each other.
[22:11.000 --> 22:12.000]  And then he's a hero.
[22:12.000 --> 22:16.000]  It's how they move the Overton window of what you'll accept.
[22:16.000 --> 22:18.000]  Oh, it's good cop, bad cop.
[22:18.000 --> 22:20.000]  Oh, the good cop just says I'm going to jail.
[22:20.000 --> 22:22.000]  The bad cop says he's going to beat me.
[22:22.000 --> 22:24.000]  Well, you shouldn't be going to jail on this hypothetical.
[22:24.000 --> 22:27.000]  But still, the good cop now you see is your savior.
[22:27.000 --> 22:30.000]  It's basic psychology, and we sit here like idiots
[22:32.000 --> 22:33.000]  and go along with it.
[22:33.000 --> 22:37.000]  So let's play a few minutes of Biden.
[22:37.000 --> 22:40.000]  Remember, it wasn't COVID killed the economy.
[22:40.000 --> 22:42.000]  It was the lockdowns.
[22:42.000 --> 22:44.000]  And India is starving to death,
[22:44.000 --> 22:46.000]  and they went back under lockdown after a year
[22:46.000 --> 22:47.000]  of being under lockdown.
[22:47.000 --> 22:49.000]  And so more people are starving to death,
[22:49.000 --> 22:50.000]  and they call it COVID.
[22:50.000 --> 22:52.000]  They're not even testing them.
[22:52.000 --> 22:54.000]  And I predicted a year ago that would be the case.
[22:54.000 --> 22:56.000]  But you would admit 280 something million people
[22:56.000 --> 22:57.000]  are starting to death.
[22:57.000 --> 22:59.000]  Already tens of millions extra have died.
[23:01.000 --> 23:02.000]  That's the plan.
[23:02.000 --> 23:06.000]  Record level, low birth rates in the West.
[23:06.000 --> 23:08.000]  Half the business is out of business.
[23:08.000 --> 23:10.000]  But you got all this free money.
[23:10.000 --> 23:14.000]  See, while they're euthanizing you, America is in hospice.
[23:14.000 --> 23:16.000]  And what do they do when, oh, you're so old,
[23:16.000 --> 23:18.000]  grandma doesn't feel well.
[23:18.000 --> 23:20.000]  You know, she's a little out of it.
[23:20.000 --> 23:22.000]  Her life's not that good.
[23:22.000 --> 23:24.000]  You put them in hospice,
[23:24.000 --> 23:26.000]  and some hospices really help, really sick dying people.
[23:26.000 --> 23:28.000]  But a lot of them are kind of wink, wink.
[23:28.000 --> 23:30.000]  We're going to put you on what they call memory care,
[23:30.000 --> 23:31.000]  where you don't have memory,
[23:31.000 --> 23:33.000]  and everybody's taking care of you and checking on you.
[23:33.000 --> 23:35.000]  And yeah, you're in a little pain.
[23:35.000 --> 23:37.000]  Let's give you some opium.
[23:37.000 --> 23:40.000]  Let's give you some painkillers.
[23:40.000 --> 23:42.000]  Let's give you some morphine.
[23:42.000 --> 23:45.000]  And then it's just kind of, oh, you don't eat anymore
[23:45.000 --> 23:48.000]  for a few weeks, a few months, and you die.
[23:48.000 --> 23:52.000]  And America's on the drip, drip, drip of free money,
[23:52.000 --> 23:54.000]  and nobody wants to go back to work.
[23:54.000 --> 23:56.000]  And it's so much fun, and it's so cool.
[23:56.000 --> 23:58.000]  But then every business I talk to,
[23:58.000 --> 24:01.000]  whether it's flooring supplies, or concrete,
[24:01.000 --> 24:04.000]  or oil and gas, or whether it's food production,
[24:04.000 --> 24:07.000]  or whether it's supplements, which is really just food production,
[24:07.000 --> 24:13.000]  concentrated food production, ammunition, textiles,
[24:13.000 --> 24:16.000]  everything you can't get.
[24:16.000 --> 24:20.000]  And it's permanent, because we built this giant infrastructure,
[24:20.000 --> 24:23.000]  and then once you shut half of it down and say it's not essential,
[24:23.000 --> 24:26.000]  well, then it doesn't have the reach anymore.
[24:26.000 --> 24:30.000]  They have a third less drivers they need to just deliver gas,
[24:30.000 --> 24:33.000]  oil, and natural gas.
[24:33.000 --> 24:35.000]  Diesel shortages, everything.
[24:35.000 --> 24:38.000]  Because the humans aren't there to run it,
[24:38.000 --> 24:40.000]  because they were paid to stay at home,
[24:40.000 --> 24:42.000]  and many of the businesses they serve are shut down.
[24:42.000 --> 24:45.000]  And so for a truck to come to your small town,
[24:45.000 --> 24:49.000]  it needed five gas stations to serve.
[24:49.000 --> 24:51.000]  And it needed to hit six or seven towns
[24:51.000 --> 24:54.000]  that had that many gas stations to come all the way out there.
[24:54.000 --> 24:56.000]  But now that half the gas station's shut down,
[24:56.000 --> 24:58.000]  now that most of folks don't travel anymore,
[24:58.000 --> 25:00.000]  do anything in the small town,
[25:00.000 --> 25:02.000]  they just sit there and get their paycheck.
[25:02.000 --> 25:04.000]  Well, now there aren't as many food deliveries in the town.
[25:04.000 --> 25:06.000]  There aren't as many gas deliveries.
[25:06.000 --> 25:08.000]  And then that breaks down the whole society,
[25:08.000 --> 25:10.000]  and soon there's nothing.
[25:10.000 --> 25:12.000]  And that's the post-industrial world
[25:12.000 --> 25:19.000]  that the UN signed on to at Rio de Janeiro in 1992
[25:19.000 --> 25:23.000]  with George Herbert Walker Bush.
[25:23.000 --> 25:25.000]  It's all computerized, it's all actuary,
[25:25.000 --> 25:29.000]  it's all battle planned, it's all prepared.
[25:29.000 --> 25:33.000]  And they meant the lockdowns to go a little bit longer in the US.
[25:33.000 --> 25:35.000]  They're still going on in Europe and Canada,
[25:35.000 --> 25:38.000]  and they're never going to recover there already.
[25:38.000 --> 25:40.000]  And Africa's starving to death.
[25:40.000 --> 25:42.000]  And Latin America's starving to death, they're collapsing.
[25:42.000 --> 25:44.000]  And the Middle East is in parts of Asia,
[25:44.000 --> 25:48.000]  and they're all getting organized by the UN to come to Europe and here.
[25:48.000 --> 25:50.000]  And they're going to be filled full of hate of white people
[25:50.000 --> 25:52.000]  and taught Marxist-Leninist world government theory,
[25:52.000 --> 25:54.000]  and they're going to be given free credit cards and free money,
[25:54.000 --> 25:57.000]  because after all, the globalists are using that as a weapon
[25:57.000 --> 26:01.000]  to devalue all your savings and to drive up prices.
[26:01.000 --> 26:05.000]  And so all the yuppies and all the trendies want to watch their Netflix
[26:05.000 --> 26:07.000]  and go to the coffee place and get their check,
[26:07.000 --> 26:10.000]  and oh, it's for the earth and wear their mask
[26:10.000 --> 26:12.000]  and feel like they're getting ahead, and this is all...
[26:12.000 --> 26:15.000]  Remember, oh, it's like a two-week extended spring break,
[26:15.000 --> 26:17.000]  they said 14 months ago.
[26:17.000 --> 26:20.000]  Be a hero, it's just two weeks, stay home.
[26:20.000 --> 26:24.000]  And then it was a year in Europe, a year in Canada,
[26:24.000 --> 26:29.000]  six months here, and total collapse around the world.
[26:29.000 --> 26:32.000]  And I'll show you the numbers, I'll show you the statistics when we come back.
[26:32.000 --> 26:35.000]  And so now the third world collapse and the weaponized
[26:35.000 --> 26:38.000]  UN system is coming for everybody.
[26:38.000 --> 26:41.000]  Congress, our governors, everybody better wake up now and realize this,
[26:41.000 --> 26:44.000]  because most of them aren't even informed on this.
[26:44.000 --> 26:47.000]  They're getting their advice from Frank Luntz, the Democrats.
[26:47.000 --> 26:51.000]  Frank Luntz couldn't find his ass, his big, giant, fat ass
[26:51.000 --> 26:54.000]  with both of his perverted hands, they're right back.
[26:56.000 --> 26:58.000]  The world is awakening.
[26:58.000 --> 27:02.000]  The world is beginning to understand the globalist paradigm.
[27:02.000 --> 27:06.000]  They are discovering the globalist, the elites, the manipulation, the CFR,
[27:06.000 --> 27:10.000]  the trilateral commission, the Bilderberg group, the Bohemian Grove,
[27:10.000 --> 27:13.000]  the Club of Rome.
[27:13.000 --> 27:17.000]  And so even though it seems like the globalists are winning,
[27:17.000 --> 27:21.000]  the truth is they've had to come out in the open to attack human freedom
[27:21.000 --> 27:23.000]  because they're actually losing.
[27:23.000 --> 27:26.000]  We have forced them out in the open.
[27:26.000 --> 27:30.000]  So as bad as these times are, a lot of negative things are about to happen.
[27:30.000 --> 27:32.000]  Realize humanity is winning.
[27:32.000 --> 27:37.000]  You've got to trust in the plan of God, and trust in the plan of God's justice.
[27:37.000 --> 27:39.000]  That is invincible.
[27:39.000 --> 27:42.000]  That is ethereal, timeless, and unstoppable.
[27:42.000 --> 27:46.000]  So don't trust in man, trust in God, to lead God and direct your soul,
[27:46.000 --> 27:48.000]  and take action against the globalists, and realize,
[27:48.000 --> 27:51.000]  you've got my commitment from Alex Jones and my crew to you.
[27:51.000 --> 27:56.000]  We will never back down from the globalists, and we will never surrender.
[27:56.000 --> 28:04.000]  Your brain, your heart, your bones, your liver, your eyes, everything
[28:04.000 --> 28:07.000]  has a better shot at surviving in this crazy environment
[28:07.000 --> 28:09.000]  when you have high quality fish oil. We've got the best out there.
[28:09.000 --> 28:12.000]  We have the highest grade of fish oil available,
[28:12.000 --> 28:14.000]  and what it does for your body is simply amazing.
[28:14.000 --> 28:17.000]  Everybody already knows what high quality fish oil does,
[28:17.000 --> 28:19.000]  and it costs us even more to put it through a process
[28:19.000 --> 28:21.000]  to remove any trace mercury that's in it.
[28:21.000 --> 28:23.000]  So this is also clean to fish oil.
[28:23.000 --> 28:26.000]  It's been sold out for months, but it's back in stock 50% off.
[28:26.000 --> 28:29.000]  Grill Oil is set to sell out, and it's amazing as well.
[28:29.000 --> 28:32.000]  It's at 25% off, but when you get them both together in a combo,
[28:32.000 --> 28:35.000]  it's 50% off as well.
[28:35.000 --> 28:38.000]  Ultimate Fish Oil, now back in stock at infomorestore.com,
[28:38.000 --> 28:40.000]  and when I forget to take it, I really feel it.

[28:42.000 --> 28:44.000]  it makes my dreams even more amazing.
[28:44.000 --> 28:46.000]  Unless you thought I was joking, you've tried it out,
[28:46.000 --> 28:48.000]  and most of you have been blown away.

[28:56.000 --> 28:59.000]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about
[28:59.000 --> 29:04.000]  for 27 years has now gone from beta testing to operational.
[29:04.000 --> 29:08.000]  The globalists are out of the open with their planetary depopulation takeover,
[29:08.000 --> 29:10.000]  their robot takeover.
[29:10.000 --> 29:13.000]  The good news is we've been working, and you've been working,
[29:13.000 --> 29:16.000]  and others have been working across the planet for decades to get ready for this,
[29:16.000 --> 29:18.000]  to be able to find it off.
[29:18.000 --> 29:20.000]  Humanity is strong, we're incredible,
[29:20.000 --> 29:22.000]  and if we're aware of the attack that's happening,
[29:22.000 --> 29:24.000]  we have a real chance of defeating it.
[29:24.000 --> 29:26.000]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[29:26.000 --> 29:29.000]  So prayer is essential, research is essential,
[29:29.000 --> 29:32.000]  getting prepared is essential, and warning others is absolutely essential.
[29:32.000 --> 29:35.000]  And at the same time, supporting info awards
[29:35.000 --> 29:38.000]  by buying high-quality products to keep us on air is essential
[29:38.000 --> 29:40.000]  because they're great products for you and your family,
[29:40.000 --> 29:42.000]  and they're also funding our operation.
[29:42.000 --> 29:44.000]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[29:44.000 --> 29:47.000]  InfoWarsStore.com is incredible.
[29:47.000 --> 29:50.000]  A lot of our products that have been sold out because the supply chain breakdowns
[29:50.000 --> 29:52.000]  are back in like bodies, vasovetes, and others,
[29:52.000 --> 29:54.000]  so get them today at infowarsstore.com,
[29:54.000 --> 29:57.000]  and I thank you for being part of the resistance.
[29:57.000 --> 30:00.000]  14 months ago, I began to see on the broadcast every day
[30:00.000 --> 30:03.000]  when the first world collapses, the third world dies.
[30:03.000 --> 30:07.000]  We have such a complex civilization with so many billions of moving parts
[30:07.000 --> 30:09.000]  that when you shut down the first world,
[30:09.000 --> 30:13.000]  it causes a chain reaction that will devastate the third world
[30:13.000 --> 30:15.000]  and really hurt the first world.
[30:15.000 --> 30:18.000]  Well, now you're hearing about gas shortages all over the United States,
[30:18.000 --> 30:21.000]  and that's because the companies and the systems and the drivers
[30:21.000 --> 30:25.000]  that could barely get the job done before delivering gas have been shut down.
[30:25.000 --> 30:28.000]  Plus, the Keystone Pipeline's been shut down, a lot of other pipelines.
[30:28.000 --> 30:32.000]  The left is now blowing up dams across the U.S.
[30:32.000 --> 30:35.000]  We're being shut down. Our coal power plants are off as well.
[30:35.000 --> 30:38.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, prepare to be a total slave.
[30:38.000 --> 30:41.000]  The third world is imploding as well. The borders have been removed.
[30:41.000 --> 30:44.000]  Until you wake up, and this is a globalist chai-com takeover,
[30:44.000 --> 30:46.000]  Gregory said, you have, no hope.
[30:46.000 --> 30:51.000]  They're announcing that there will be less than two-thirds of the gas needed this summer.
[30:51.000 --> 30:53.000]  So they told you that you're under lockdown one way or another
[30:53.000 --> 31:10.000]  and CNN laughed at you and your family.
[31:10.000 --> 31:25.000]  In 1814, we took a little trip along with Colonel Jackson down the mighty Mississippi.
[31:25.000 --> 31:27.000]  We took a little bacon and we took the little beans
[31:27.000 --> 31:30.000]  and we caught the bloody British in a town in New Orleans.
[31:30.000 --> 31:33.000]  We fired our guns and the British kept becoming.
[31:33.000 --> 31:35.000]  There wasn't as many as there was a while ago.
[31:35.000 --> 31:38.000]  We fired once more and they'd begin to run in.
[31:38.000 --> 31:43.000]  Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
[31:43.000 --> 31:46.000]  Well, we looked down the river and we see the British come
[31:46.000 --> 31:49.000]  and they must have been a hundred of them peaking on the drums.
[31:49.000 --> 31:52.000]  They stepped so high and they made the bugles ring.
[31:52.000 --> 31:55.000]  We stood beside our cotton veils and didn't say a thing.
[31:55.000 --> 31:57.000]  We fired our guns and the British...
[31:57.000 --> 32:00.000]  All right, I'm going to give the phone number out here in a few minutes
[32:00.000 --> 32:02.000]  and we're also going to get on the board,
[32:02.000 --> 32:04.000]  the callers that I promised to call back here today
[32:04.000 --> 32:06.000]  that we're still holding on the broadcast ended.
[32:06.000 --> 32:08.000]  Your stories of vaccines, did you love them?
[32:08.000 --> 32:10.000]  Did you hate them? Was there any response?
[32:10.000 --> 32:12.000]  Did you get sick? Did you feel great?
[32:12.000 --> 32:15.000]  Like different CNN hosts have said, they just was euphoric
[32:15.000 --> 32:19.000]  and it was like taking a wonderful drug, all pure bull, of course.
[32:19.000 --> 32:21.000]  I'd like to hear from you. How long have you got the number out now?
[32:21.000 --> 32:24.000]  877-789-2539.
[32:24.000 --> 32:27.000]  877-789-2539.
[32:27.000 --> 32:29.000]  877-789-Alex.
[32:29.000 --> 32:32.000]  And that is obviously for first-time callers
[32:32.000 --> 32:35.000]  who are medical workers or nurses
[32:35.000 --> 32:40.000]  or people that work in pharmacies, people that work in nursing homes.
[32:40.000 --> 32:46.000]  We'd like to hear your take 877-789-2539 today.
[32:46.000 --> 32:49.000]  And as I said, I'm going to get into the whole race war
[32:49.000 --> 32:51.000]  under globalists who are trying to start to overshadow
[32:51.000 --> 32:54.000]  and smokescreen that it's an economic collapse for witnessing
[32:54.000 --> 32:59.000]  the Federal Reserve trying to cover up for hyperinflation,
[32:59.000 --> 33:03.000]  which is really almost a form of stag inflation
[33:03.000 --> 33:06.000]  or stagflation, because you're going to have a shutdown
[33:06.000 --> 33:09.000]  and a shortage of goods and a shortage of workers
[33:09.000 --> 33:13.000]  because they're paid not to work.
[33:13.000 --> 33:16.000]  But then you're also going to have an increase in prices
[33:16.000 --> 33:19.000]  because of scarcity. We haven't seen that since the 1970s.
[33:19.000 --> 33:22.000]  You know, economists can argue all day about what this is going to do,
[33:22.000 --> 33:25.000]  but there's a race to the value currencies around the world
[33:25.000 --> 33:30.000]  and Joe Biden wanted to print $4 trillion, certainly isn't going to help.
[33:30.000 --> 33:35.000]  But we passed that Rubicon a long, long, long, long time ago
[33:35.000 --> 33:39.000]  by the time Trump was trying to restart the economy doing it.
[33:39.000 --> 33:42.000]  We were far gone at that point. These global currencies
[33:42.000 --> 33:44.000]  are going to have to be reset.
[33:44.000 --> 33:47.000]  The globalists are going to reset them where they get all the money up front
[33:47.000 --> 33:50.000]  while it's at less value and you get the debt on the other side.
[33:50.000 --> 33:53.000]  Then they're going to say, well, submit to our political whims
[33:53.000 --> 33:57.000]  and we'll give you a universal income of $1,200 a month on average or so,
[33:57.000 --> 34:01.000]  which you get in this future won't buy you a pot to piss in
[34:01.000 --> 34:03.000]  or a window to throw it out of.
[34:03.000 --> 34:06.000]  So I'm not trying to scare you. I'm not trying to be negative.
[34:06.000 --> 34:13.000]  It was not hard last year, but I was on air to say,
[34:13.000 --> 34:17.000]  the smartest bet you can make is getting storeable food
[34:17.000 --> 34:20.000]  and getting out of the cities because this lockdown is never going to end.
[34:20.000 --> 34:23.000]  They'll take it off for a little while only to put it back on.
[34:23.000 --> 34:25.000]  That's the plan. We've got all their battle plans.
[34:25.000 --> 34:27.000]  My goodness. We've got their playbooks.
[34:27.000 --> 34:29.000]  And you see that already happening in Europe and other areas.
[34:29.000 --> 34:33.000]  It's coming back here. We're saying, oh, now for the flu or now for new variants.
[34:33.000 --> 34:36.000]  But they always want you to think you're going to get out of it
[34:36.000 --> 34:38.000]  so you don't ever resist.
[34:38.000 --> 34:40.000]  And when they finally clamp down the third or fourth time,
[34:40.000 --> 34:42.000]  it'll never come off.
[34:42.000 --> 34:46.000]  It'll only get tighter and tighter and tighter as you see already happening
[34:46.000 --> 34:49.000]  in Spain and in London and in areas of Canada
[34:49.000 --> 34:52.000]  where they are under real hardcore martial law.
[34:52.000 --> 34:55.000]  The answer is stop complying, stop following it.
[34:55.000 --> 34:57.000]  The government's outlaw, the government's criminal,
[34:57.000 --> 35:00.000]  the government's oppressing you, the government's not legitimate.
[35:00.000 --> 35:03.000]  It's chai-com, globalist run.
[35:03.000 --> 35:08.000]  So following its directives is now a crime against your family and humanity.
[35:08.000 --> 35:12.000]  Any of this unconstitutional crap, any of the contact tracers,
[35:12.000 --> 35:14.000]  any intimidation to have inoculations,
[35:14.000 --> 35:16.000]  anybody telling you you've got to wear a mask,
[35:16.000 --> 35:19.000]  anybody giving you this crap is part of the enemy army
[35:19.000 --> 35:22.000]  literally that engineered this whole damn thing out of Wuhan.
[35:22.000 --> 35:24.000]  And it is a real virus.
[35:24.000 --> 35:26.000]  If you don't have your right vitamins and minerals,
[35:26.000 --> 35:28.000]  any virus can kill you better than a hammer.
[35:28.000 --> 35:33.000]  But I showed you the University of Texas level four bio weapons lab,
[35:33.000 --> 35:35.000]  one of the top five in the world,
[35:35.000 --> 35:40.000]  tell you nine years ago that they tested coronavirus vaccines on lab rats
[35:40.000 --> 35:45.000]  and it killed them with blood clots.
[35:45.000 --> 35:47.000]  And so that's the bottom line.
[35:47.000 --> 35:52.000]  I tell people that it's a UN consortium of Soros,
[35:52.000 --> 35:57.000]  the British royal family, and the Clintons
[35:57.000 --> 36:00.000]  globally get hundreds of billions of dollars now,
[36:00.000 --> 36:03.000]  where governments, I mean Texas copped up several billion to Google
[36:03.000 --> 36:05.000]  to run contact tracing.
[36:05.000 --> 36:08.000]  It's like three billion dollars, the governor did.
[36:08.000 --> 36:11.000]  And then that's given to Google and then they hire,
[36:11.000 --> 36:13.000]  left this out of a database,
[36:13.000 --> 36:16.000]  and they're giving them law enforcement power
[36:16.000 --> 36:18.000]  in many areas of the country and the world.
[36:18.000 --> 36:20.000]  I mean, these are gangs, folks.
[36:20.000 --> 36:24.000]  You know, you heard of the Mexican mafia,
[36:24.000 --> 36:27.000]  you heard of the Hells Angels, you know,
[36:27.000 --> 36:30.000]  MS-13, the Chinese triads,
[36:30.000 --> 36:31.000]  you all heard of those kind of gangs?
[36:31.000 --> 36:33.000]  Those kind of gangs are nothing.
[36:33.000 --> 36:36.000]  This is big tech and the lawyers and the media
[36:36.000 --> 36:38.000]  and the Democrats and the foreign banks
[36:38.000 --> 36:41.000]  and the Chinese and the Islamists and Hollywood
[36:41.000 --> 36:48.000]  all ganged up on us with academia as well.
[36:48.000 --> 36:52.000]  That's why rebel media, such great folks,
[36:52.000 --> 36:55.000]  had their banking taken away from them yesterday
[36:55.000 --> 36:58.000]  with their PayPal,
[36:58.000 --> 37:00.000]  because they're a good, decent media group.
[37:00.000 --> 37:02.000]  And the globalists won't do it to everybody,
[37:02.000 --> 37:04.000]  so we've got to create our own banks,
[37:04.000 --> 37:07.000]  our own systems, our own infrastructure.
[37:07.000 --> 37:09.000]  And people are starting to do that,
[37:09.000 --> 37:12.000]  and I'll just leave it at that.
[37:12.000 --> 37:14.000]  But separately, steel prices have tripled,
[37:14.000 --> 37:18.000]  corn has exploded, every commodity is exploding.
[37:18.000 --> 37:21.000]  And that's why I said, get into a basket of commodities,
[37:21.000 --> 37:25.000]  that's my advice to myself, if I was an investor,
[37:25.000 --> 37:27.000]  and get invested in a place in the country,
[37:27.000 --> 37:30.000]  doesn't need to be fancy, but away from people,
[37:30.000 --> 37:32.000]  and know your neighbors and have friends and family
[37:32.000 --> 37:34.000]  that are aware, and having your own gang,
[37:34.000 --> 37:36.000]  your own people to watch each other's back
[37:36.000 --> 37:38.000]  is the most valuable thing in this universe
[37:38.000 --> 37:41.000]  other than a relationship with Jesus Christ,
[37:41.000 --> 37:44.000]  the Son of God.
[37:44.000 --> 37:46.000]  And so you better get ready now.
[37:46.000 --> 37:49.000]  I mean, look, I told you this a year ago, buy ammo,
[37:49.000 --> 37:51.000]  buy guns, they're going to steal the election from Trump,
[37:51.000 --> 37:53.000]  and they're going to really clamp down.
[37:53.000 --> 37:55.000]  They're going to start a race war as the cover
[37:55.000 --> 37:56.000]  for the economic collapse.
[37:56.000 --> 37:57.000]  This is all a battle plan.
[37:57.000 --> 37:59.000]  We know what they're going to do.
[37:59.000 --> 38:01.000]  We should have been able to stop it,
[38:01.000 --> 38:02.000]  and no folks didn't listen.
[38:02.000 --> 38:04.000]  Now people are listening.
[38:04.000 --> 38:07.000]  And I don't say that to act tough.
[38:07.000 --> 38:09.000]  I don't say that to be impressive.
[38:09.000 --> 38:11.000]  It's just everybody needs to know what you've done
[38:11.000 --> 38:15.000]  keeping us on the air.
[38:15.000 --> 38:17.000]  We have all the big so-called
[38:17.000 --> 38:19.000]  government intelligence agencies listening.
[38:19.000 --> 38:23.000]  They're now just like the Stigial Web's
[38:23.000 --> 38:28.000]  on a Labrador retriever's feet.
[38:28.000 --> 38:32.000]  Or it's like people that grow a sixth toe or something.
[38:32.000 --> 38:34.000]  They don't run any power.
[38:34.000 --> 38:35.000]  They're just puppets.
[38:35.000 --> 38:37.000]  Those are the private groups, the big tech.
[38:37.000 --> 38:39.000]  They've got their own hit teams,
[38:39.000 --> 38:43.000]  their own labs making deadly synthetic drugs.
[38:43.000 --> 38:45.000]  I mean, just their own pedophile operations
[38:45.000 --> 38:47.000]  is giant industrial level evil.
[38:47.000 --> 38:51.000]  Just chewing up humanity like a combine
[38:51.000 --> 38:56.000]  cuts wheat or bales grass into bales of hay.
[38:56.000 --> 38:59.000]  And as soon as we realize how much trouble we're in,
[38:59.000 --> 39:01.000]  we'll be able to turn this around.
[39:01.000 --> 39:03.000]  But I told everybody this.
[39:03.000 --> 39:07.000]  I'll do a plug right now because I sell and stay on air
[39:07.000 --> 39:10.000]  with what I do myself.
[39:10.000 --> 39:12.000]  And I went out and got the best storeable food company.
[39:12.000 --> 39:14.000]  We sell it directly from infowarestore.com.
[39:14.000 --> 39:15.000]  They're full catalog.
[39:15.000 --> 39:16.000]  You get 10% off.
[39:16.000 --> 39:18.000]  The lowest price is already out there.
[39:18.000 --> 39:22.000]  But I can only run that until next week, next Wednesday.
[39:22.000 --> 39:25.000]  And they've already gone up on prices three times last year.
[39:25.000 --> 39:27.000]  Other groups have gone up way more than that
[39:27.000 --> 39:29.000]  because we told you the food prices are exploding.
[39:29.000 --> 39:31.000]  So I would get 2020 food prices now
[39:31.000 --> 39:34.000]  at preparewithalix.com or just find a subsection
[39:34.000 --> 39:36.000]  for storeablefoodinfowarestore.com.
[39:36.000 --> 39:38.000]  And I would buy a lot of food.
[39:38.000 --> 39:40.000]  I'm buying more storeable food.
[39:40.000 --> 39:42.000]  I'm buying more ammunition.
[39:42.000 --> 39:47.000]  I am selling my house in Austin.
[39:47.000 --> 39:50.000]  Just had the realtor photographer over to get that done.
[39:50.000 --> 39:53.000]  And I am telling you right now, ladies and gentlemen,
[39:53.000 --> 39:56.000]  that there's a 90% chance we're going to go road warrior
[39:56.000 --> 39:59.000]  in this country for probably five, 10 years.
[39:59.000 --> 40:02.000]  I mean, when this is all over, I would be surprised
[40:02.000 --> 40:04.000]  50 million, 100 million people aren't dead.
[40:04.000 --> 40:06.000]  And you know, I've never talked like that
[40:06.000 --> 40:07.000]  in my 27 years on air.
[40:07.000 --> 40:12.000]  I genuinely think that 90% chance it's all over.
[40:12.000 --> 40:13.000]  OK?
[40:13.000 --> 40:15.000]  Long, evil dark age, giant wars,
[40:15.000 --> 40:17.000]  bioweapons for real being released,
[40:17.000 --> 40:19.000]  probably even nuclear war.
[40:19.000 --> 40:20.000]  I mean, it's on.
[40:20.000 --> 40:21.000]  The collapse of civilization is here.
[40:21.000 --> 40:23.000]  So I would get storeable food while you can.
[40:23.000 --> 40:26.000]  I believe, and my supplier has scaled up
[40:26.000 --> 40:29.000]  triple what they were just two years ago.
[40:29.000 --> 40:32.000]  The method of putting our money where our mouth is,
[40:32.000 --> 40:35.000]  that there will be giant lines for food
[40:35.000 --> 40:36.000]  within six months to a year.
[40:36.000 --> 40:37.000]  And I hope I'm wrong.
[40:37.000 --> 40:39.000]  I hope some miracles happen,
[40:39.000 --> 40:41.000]  but that's the trajectory of where we're going.
[40:41.000 --> 40:43.000]  So I'd get ready now, three months, six months,
[40:43.000 --> 40:45.000]  your supplies, infowarstore.com,
[40:45.000 --> 40:49.000]  parallelics.com, or AAA-253-3139.
[40:49.000 --> 40:51.000]  All right, I'm going to finish up with the economic news.
[40:51.000 --> 40:54.000]  Take your phone calls on the vaccines you've taken
[40:54.000 --> 40:57.000]  or what you've heard.
[40:57.000 --> 40:58.000]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut.
[40:58.000 --> 40:59.000]  You're on the air.
[40:59.000 --> 41:00.000]  Thanks for holding.
[41:00.000 --> 41:01.000]  Hello, can you hear me?
[41:01.000 --> 41:02.000]  I sure can, sir.
[41:02.000 --> 41:03.000]  Thank you.
[41:03.000 --> 41:04.000]  Hey, Alex, before I start, man,
[41:04.000 --> 41:06.000]  I just wanted to talk to you, bro,
[41:06.000 --> 41:08.000]  and it's a pleasure to be talking right now.
[41:08.000 --> 41:09.000]  Sure, man.
[41:09.000 --> 41:10.000]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[41:10.000 --> 41:12.000]  I'm 24 years old, and you're a friend in Connecticut,
[41:12.000 --> 41:14.000]  and I just want to plug in.
[41:14.000 --> 41:17.000]  I'm a truck driver, and two before us have changed.
[41:17.000 --> 41:20.000]  The way I drive, me and my brothers,
[41:20.000 --> 41:24.000]  that drive, and a couple of us, we are Hispanics, Cubans,
[41:24.000 --> 41:25.000]  Puerto Ricans.
[41:25.000 --> 41:29.000]  We used to be on Monster and Red Bull and Rolla,
[41:29.000 --> 41:32.000]  and I have lost weight because I stopped drinking all that sugar,
[41:32.000 --> 41:34.000]  and I just want to thank you for that, man.
[41:34.000 --> 41:36.000]  Well, brother, we put more in this than any other
[41:36.000 --> 41:39.000]  long-term, high-quality energy powder there is.
[41:39.000 --> 41:42.000]  So this was designed on one of the top guys in the country.
[41:42.000 --> 41:44.000]  He didn't want his name on it because, obviously,
[41:44.000 --> 41:45.000]  the political issues, but we had to pay a lot of money
[41:45.000 --> 41:47.000]  for this formulation just for the design of it.
[41:47.000 --> 41:50.000]  And we believe it is the best, strongest, but healthiest energy
[41:50.000 --> 41:53.000]  out there, and you're saying that it's made your life better,
[41:53.000 --> 41:54.000]  so that means a lot to me.
[41:54.000 --> 41:55.000]  Thank you to all your truck drivers.
[41:55.000 --> 41:56.000]  We love you.
[41:56.000 --> 41:58.000]  When listeners call into the show and thank me for all I've done,
[41:58.000 --> 42:00.000]  I always stop them and I say,
[42:00.000 --> 42:02.000]  thank you for what you've done.
[42:02.000 --> 42:04.000]  Thank you for keeping InfoWars on the air.
[42:04.000 --> 42:08.000]  Thank you for praying for us, and thank you for spreading the word.
[42:08.000 --> 42:11.000]  If all of you will simply go to InfoWarsStore.com
[42:11.000 --> 42:15.000]  and get a privacy pocket for your iPhone or a droid,
[42:15.000 --> 42:19.000]  it will teach you and others that these things are surveilling you.
[42:19.000 --> 42:22.000]  It will remind you every day, like it does me and my family,
[42:22.000 --> 42:25.000]  and it will protect where you go and what you do.
[42:25.000 --> 42:26.000]  Not because you've done something wrong,
[42:26.000 --> 42:29.000]  but because the big telecoms, big tech, and the globalists
[42:29.000 --> 42:32.000]  are predatory and are evil, and in the surveillance state,
[42:32.000 --> 42:34.000]  we need to more and more start doing everything we can
[42:34.000 --> 42:37.000]  to mitigate the criminal activity they're involved in.
[42:37.000 --> 42:39.000]  These are the highest quality, highest ratings.
[42:39.000 --> 42:42.000]  They're available at InfoWarsStore.com in four different colors,
[42:42.000 --> 42:46.000]  and they are only $19.95. The exact same pocket is sold for $24.95,
[42:46.000 --> 42:48.000]  or even $29.95 everywhere.
[42:48.000 --> 42:51.000]  They're available right now for $19.95, and they fund the InfoWars.
[42:51.000 --> 42:55.000]  Please take action today, protect your privacy, and fund the InfoWars.
[42:57.000 --> 43:01.000]  Listeners have rightfully been complaining the last six months or so,
[43:01.000 --> 43:05.000]  saying, where are most of the best-selling products you have that we love?
[43:05.000 --> 43:08.000]  And my answer is the supply chain has broken down.
[43:08.000 --> 43:11.000]  I have to either reformulate or I have to lower the quality
[43:11.000 --> 43:14.000]  to get a lot of these, and so that's why we don't have a lot of products in.
[43:14.000 --> 43:18.000]  That's why InfoWars is in financial trouble, is because if we had the products,
[43:18.000 --> 43:20.000]  you would be buying it, we'd have the money.
[43:20.000 --> 43:22.000]  But so many of them have been sold out, just like you noticed,
[43:22.000 --> 43:25.000]  a lot of other items at the store aren't available,
[43:25.000 --> 43:27.000]  because civilization is being artificially imploded.
[43:27.000 --> 43:31.000]  But finally, X2 is back in stock with a good halogen,
[43:31.000 --> 43:34.000]  Deep Earth Crystal iodide, so essential in your body.
[43:34.000 --> 43:37.000]  It's really the missing link. It's 50% off.
[43:37.000 --> 43:40.000]  We've got a big shipment of it at InfoWarsStore.com.
[43:40.000 --> 43:43.000]  Now, when it gets ready to sell out, we'll have to go back to near full price,
[43:43.000 --> 43:46.000]  take advantage of this now, stock up, and don't forget to take your X2,
[43:46.000 --> 43:50.000]  because I have a tendency to forget how great it is and not take it myself.
[43:50.000 --> 43:54.000]  But when I do, stamina, libido, energy, weight loss, it's incredible.
[43:54.000 --> 43:57.000]  It's essential. It's X2 at InfoWarsStore.com.
[43:57.000 --> 44:01.000]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point. It's very bittersweet.
[44:01.000 --> 44:04.000]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would,
[44:04.000 --> 44:06.000]  and now we have a lot of credibility, but I don't care about that.
[44:06.000 --> 44:08.000]  I care about beating the new world order.
[44:08.000 --> 44:13.000]  And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[44:13.000 --> 44:16.000]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us.
[44:16.000 --> 44:19.000]  For a lot of reasons, I can't tell you what's going on, but let's just say this.
[44:19.000 --> 44:23.000]  We're going to see this through to the end. We're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[44:23.000 --> 44:27.000]  So please pray for us and please buy the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[44:27.000 --> 44:30.000]  They're great products, plus they fund the operation.
[44:30.000 --> 44:33.000]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[44:33.000 --> 44:35.000]  Do they fund freedom? No, a lot of them don't.
[44:35.000 --> 44:38.000]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice
[44:38.000 --> 44:41.000]  when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth.
[44:41.000 --> 44:43.000]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[44:43.000 --> 44:46.000]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[44:46.000 --> 44:49.000]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[44:49.000 --> 44:52.000]  Download everything we've done you can find and save it,
[44:52.000 --> 44:54.000]  because who knows how long we're going to be on the air
[44:54.000 --> 45:05.000]  and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[45:24.000 --> 45:37.000]  Let's go to Luckinbach, Texas.
[45:37.000 --> 45:42.000]  Hell, I might actually move out by Luckinbach. I'm looking at that.
[45:42.000 --> 45:46.000]  The successful life we're living.
[45:46.000 --> 46:09.000]  Crack it up for a minute for me.
[46:09.000 --> 46:11.000]  You know, sometimes when I want to play a little bit of music,
[46:11.000 --> 46:14.000]  I want to just cut to a shot, maybe with a wall.
[46:14.000 --> 46:18.000]  It's not just staring at my ugly fat head while I play it.
[46:18.000 --> 46:27.000]  So baby, let's sell your diamond ring, buy some boots and fade your jeans and go away.
[46:27.000 --> 46:36.000]  This golden tie is choking me and in your high society you cry all day.
[46:36.000 --> 46:41.000]  We've been so busy keeping up with the jokes.
[46:41.000 --> 46:48.000]  I can't keep up with the jokes.
[46:48.000 --> 46:51.000]  All right, folks, welcome back. I really appreciate y'all.
[46:51.000 --> 46:54.000]  It'd be nice to be sitting out on the creek somewhere fishing,
[46:54.000 --> 47:01.000]  listening to a little bit of Whalen Jennings and Willie and the boys.
[47:01.000 --> 47:04.000]  Never got a chance to hang out with Whalen Jennings,
[47:04.000 --> 47:07.000]  but I have hung out quite a bit with old Willie Nelson
[47:07.000 --> 47:11.000]  and I've hung out quite a bit with Whalen Jennings' son who's just as talented as he is.
[47:11.000 --> 47:15.000]  You know, usually a lot of times the son isn't as talented as the superstar father,
[47:15.000 --> 47:18.000]  but old Shooter Jennings is amazing.
[47:18.000 --> 47:21.000]  There's a lot of big, big, big genres of music.
[47:21.000 --> 47:24.000]  He's invited me on the road with him and stuff. I never had time to do it.
[47:24.000 --> 47:28.000]  But after the collapse, we'll probably all have a lot of time to sit around.
[47:28.000 --> 47:32.000]  Hopefully we'll all have food during it. Let me get real serious.
[47:32.000 --> 47:36.000]  It's hard to go ahead and just say all these things on air,
[47:36.000 --> 47:38.000]  but I meant everything I said earlier.
[47:38.000 --> 47:42.000]  They have designed a planetary collapse
[47:42.000 --> 47:46.000]  and they're not just going to collapse the third world and let folks starve to death en masse.
[47:46.000 --> 47:51.000]  They're planning to use major civil unrest and civil war here
[47:51.000 --> 47:55.000]  to just destroy our political system, destroy our prosperity
[47:55.000 --> 48:02.000]  and create so much hell that we accept the end of all our basic freedoms going forward.
[48:02.000 --> 48:07.000]  And the whole COVID lockdown is just the first shallow of that to get us off balance
[48:07.000 --> 48:09.000]  and get us prepared for it.
[48:09.000 --> 48:14.000]  And so if I was you, I would get ready.
[48:14.000 --> 48:16.000]  And that means spiritually get ready.
[48:16.000 --> 48:21.000]  It means sit down with your friends and family and have real talks with them.
[48:21.000 --> 48:25.000]  I've been having talks with my friends, my family, my wife on a daily basis.
[48:25.000 --> 48:28.000]  I just stop people when we're standing around the break room
[48:28.000 --> 48:31.000]  or when I'm at home with my children at night
[48:31.000 --> 48:34.000]  and I just get my wife by the arm and I say, listen to me.
[48:34.000 --> 48:36.000]  All this stuff isn't going to be here.
[48:36.000 --> 48:41.000]  So 90% chance and she's seen me right enough and she knows I'm not joking around
[48:41.000 --> 48:46.000]  and she understands it, but I've got to get this straight through my head too.
[48:46.000 --> 48:48.000]  We don't have a lot of time.
[48:48.000 --> 48:51.000]  Every day, every week we're still on air as a blessing, folks.
[48:51.000 --> 48:56.000]  I really don't think we're going to be on air in a year on the current trajectory we're on.
[48:56.000 --> 48:58.000]  The globalists aren't going to give Trump a chance.
[48:58.000 --> 49:02.000]  They're not going to give the Republicans a chance to take back the House and probably the Senate.
[49:02.000 --> 49:04.000]  They had to steal that last election.
[49:04.000 --> 49:05.000]  That was a landslide.
[49:05.000 --> 49:08.000]  They're making their move, people.
[49:08.000 --> 49:11.000]  This isn't a damn drill.
[49:11.000 --> 49:14.000]  Everything else she saw was a probe.
[49:14.000 --> 49:16.000]  Everything else she's seen was a test.
[49:16.000 --> 49:19.000]  Getting chills right now like a lightning bolt that struck me.
[49:19.000 --> 49:22.000]  You know, when I get the chills, when I'm right.
[49:22.000 --> 49:25.000]  The chills are when your spirit knows you're right and says that's it.
[49:25.000 --> 49:28.000]  The creepy crawls in the back of your neck when you're around somebody creepy,
[49:28.000 --> 49:30.000]  that you're in your soul selling either bad.
[49:30.000 --> 49:33.000]  You need to start following those feelings, folks,
[49:33.000 --> 49:38.000]  and all the evidence for the feelings is right here too.
[49:38.000 --> 49:40.000]  We better get on our knees to pray to God.
[49:40.000 --> 49:45.000]  Look, look, tell me which callers were on the line yesterday so I can go to them first when we start the next hour.
[49:45.000 --> 49:50.000]  I know it was Nicole and Sarah and a few others, but just a little...
[49:50.000 --> 49:57.000]  I see it says yesterday, yesterday, yesterday, so I'll go to Nicole and Brian and others that were holding first,
[49:57.000 --> 50:04.000]  and then we'll get to Ed and John and Nelson and Creed and Sarah and so many others
[50:04.000 --> 50:06.000]  that are patiently holding when we start the next hour.
[50:06.000 --> 50:10.000]  And then I'll get into the anti-foot communists and what they're doing around the world
[50:10.000 --> 50:13.000]  and all the rest of it after we've done that.
[50:13.000 --> 50:17.000]  But these are the times that prime men's souls make no mistake.
[50:17.000 --> 50:23.000]  And then one of my writers came over to me and gave me this article.
[50:23.000 --> 50:27.000]  It's in Buzzfeed to the Daily Beast.
[50:27.000 --> 50:31.000]  It's in Sputnik, and it's coming out in the divorce of Bill O. Melinda Gates.
[50:31.000 --> 50:37.000]  And what did I tell you that my gut, all the evidence told me was why Melinda Gates left him,
[50:37.000 --> 50:41.000]  was to keep the foundation safe when he goes down and to move the halo,
[50:41.000 --> 50:48.000]  and as Dr. McCullough said, he had a better way of saying it, from Bill who's going down to Melinda.
[50:48.000 --> 50:52.000]  But what's the final straw for her?
[50:52.000 --> 50:57.000]  Not just Jeffrey Epstein, he hang out with another dead, arrested pedophile.
[50:57.000 --> 51:02.000]  Who's that big Canadian fashion guy who turned up a big pedo, best buddies with him?
[51:02.000 --> 51:04.000]  Peter Nygaard.
[51:04.000 --> 51:07.000]  Peter Nygaard.
[51:07.000 --> 51:09.000]  That's right, thanks for remembering that.
[51:09.000 --> 51:11.000]  So there you go.
[51:11.000 --> 51:18.000]  Melinda Gates reportedly turned on him over the fact that he likes to hang out
[51:18.000 --> 51:22.000]  and have sex with 12-year-old girls.
[51:22.000 --> 51:25.000]  Some of them, well, that's what we know right at the houses he stayed at,
[51:25.000 --> 51:33.000]  flown in on airplanes, bought from their parents in Bosnia, Herzegovina.
[51:33.000 --> 51:35.000]  Yeah, that's their favorites.
[51:35.000 --> 51:40.000]  Nine times out of 10, their little harems are Eastern European girls out of Ukraine
[51:40.000 --> 51:45.000]  and out of Serbia, Bosnia, Albania.
[51:45.000 --> 51:50.000]  They just sell their children.
[51:50.000 --> 51:54.000]  Plus, people have been selling their kids for a long time over there since the Muslims took over.
[51:54.000 --> 51:56.000]  They invaded over 1,000 years ago.
[51:56.000 --> 51:58.000]  They stopped them a bunch.
[51:58.000 --> 52:01.000]  Of course, they had to stop them now, old Clinton bombed Serbs
[52:01.000 --> 52:04.000]  for daring to fight the precious little Muslims.
[52:04.000 --> 52:08.000]  Canadian fashion mogul Peter Nygaard arrested on federal sex trafficking charges.
[52:08.000 --> 52:11.000]  What did I say the day of the event?
[52:11.000 --> 52:13.000]  I said, I bet it comes out.
[52:13.000 --> 52:16.000]  It's because he's going down for a pedo rink.
[52:16.000 --> 52:18.000]  And now, Jiminy Crickets.
[52:18.000 --> 52:19.000]  It's in the news.
[52:19.000 --> 52:21.000]  Infowars.com.
[52:21.000 --> 52:23.000]  Tomorrow's news today.
[52:23.000 --> 52:25.000]  But since I mentioned it, let me show you this stuff.
[52:25.000 --> 52:28.000]  Overhead shot, please, for TV viewers.
[52:28.000 --> 52:30.000]  Radio posters can pull all this up.
[52:30.000 --> 52:34.000]  Shocking data. April payrolls miss huge.
[52:34.000 --> 52:38.000]  266,000k jobs added below expectations of 1 million.
[52:38.000 --> 52:42.000]  And Biden's off explaining that he was going to save you from the lockdown they put in place.
[52:42.000 --> 52:45.000]  As Biden pushes trillions of stimulus,
[52:45.000 --> 52:47.000]  employers struggle to lure people back to work.
[52:47.000 --> 52:48.000]  Yeah, it's called free money.
[52:48.000 --> 52:52.000]  No one wants to work to create scarcity and inflation.
[52:52.000 --> 52:54.000]  Printing money creates inflation.
[52:54.000 --> 52:59.000]  But if there's a glut of goods, you can hold it off some when there's a shortage
[52:59.000 --> 53:02.000]  of money printing, it's called perfect storm.
[53:02.000 --> 53:04.000]  And the globalists did it on purpose.
[53:04.000 --> 53:07.000]  How trillions of newly printed money created a labor shortage.
[53:07.000 --> 53:08.000]  Who's hiring?
[53:08.000 --> 53:09.000]  And who's firing?
[53:09.000 --> 53:12.000]  Golden age for waiters and car dealers.
[53:12.000 --> 53:15.000]  Everybody's literally playing cards as the Titanic sinks.
[53:15.000 --> 53:16.000]  Not me.
[53:16.000 --> 53:18.000]  I'm already in the lifeboat.
[53:18.000 --> 53:22.000]  The Fed embraces its inner Zimbabwean.
[53:22.000 --> 53:24.000]  Socialism payroll numbers collapse.
[53:24.000 --> 53:27.000]  Americans paid to sit home and watch TV.
[53:27.000 --> 53:32.000]  Foreign prices touch eight year high as Albert Edwards worries about food inflation.
[53:32.000 --> 53:38.000]  One bank warns of soaring food prices global index 76% increase by end of summer
[53:38.000 --> 53:42.000]  and already made purchases worldwide Bloomberg Agri index.
[53:42.000 --> 53:48.000]  How Costco is masking a 14% price in food with shrink inflation.
[53:48.000 --> 53:53.000]  By just giving you less but more air in the packaging and injecting water into the beef and chicken.
[53:53.000 --> 53:56.000]  Fed officials says inflation will be temporary.
[53:56.000 --> 53:57.000]  Like death.
[53:57.000 --> 54:00.000]  Like the toilet paper shortage last year.
[54:00.000 --> 54:01.000]  Yeah, right.
[54:01.000 --> 54:02.000]  Sure.
[54:02.000 --> 54:03.000]  It's all there.
[54:03.000 --> 54:05.000]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[54:05.000 --> 54:08.000]  Oh, my goodness.
[54:08.000 --> 54:10.000]  What a big deal.
[54:10.000 --> 54:11.000]  What a problem.
[54:11.000 --> 54:15.000]  It makes me have an anxiety attack.
[54:15.000 --> 54:17.000]  I mean, again, I'm not somebody that has anxiety attacks.
[54:17.000 --> 54:19.000]  I'm giving speech to 10,000 people.
[54:19.000 --> 54:21.000]  I'm about to get in a fight.
[54:21.000 --> 54:22.000]  I feel great.
[54:22.000 --> 54:24.000]  My heart even hardly speeds up.
[54:24.000 --> 54:28.000]  But right now my heart's going pitter-patter, pitter-patter.
[54:28.000 --> 54:33.000]  And I'm having an anxiety attack because I want to stop this.
[54:33.000 --> 54:36.000]  It's like knowing a kid's tired of the railroad tracks of your kid,
[54:36.000 --> 54:38.000]  but you're chained up yourself down the road in the basement.
[54:38.000 --> 54:40.000]  You can't get there and save your kid.
[54:40.000 --> 54:43.000]  We are all going over the edge of a cliff right now.
[54:43.000 --> 54:45.000]  We're in that magic moment.
[54:45.000 --> 54:49.000]  But you know, the public's not going to wake up and you know, the globalists are going to keep pushing.
[54:49.000 --> 54:51.000]  And so we're going over the waterfall.
[54:51.000 --> 54:55.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, Niagara Falls right in the mouth of Satan.
[54:55.000 --> 54:57.000]  And I guess we kind of deserve it.
[54:57.000 --> 54:58.000]  We've gotten soft.
[54:58.000 --> 54:59.000]  We've gotten stupid.
[54:59.000 --> 55:01.000]  We've gotten dishonorable.
[55:01.000 --> 55:05.000]  We've turned into just a bunch of trash, myself included, at certain levels.
[55:05.000 --> 55:10.000]  And so nature of wars of vacuum out goes the good.
[55:10.000 --> 55:13.000]  In comes the bad, ladies and gentlemen.
[55:13.000 --> 55:15.000]  I mean, take that report I did yesterday.
[55:15.000 --> 55:20.000]  I was rewatching that last night where tens of thousands of children were replaced with pedophiles.
[55:20.000 --> 55:23.000]  That's industrial level in Germany knowingly to destroy the family.
[55:23.000 --> 55:29.000]  And now the same groups are in Canada taking foster children and giving them to these weirdos that call it sex changes.
[55:29.000 --> 55:31.000]  You're not going to have sex with your kids.
[55:31.000 --> 55:33.000]  They're going to cut their genitals off.
[55:33.000 --> 55:39.000]  And it's liberal and loving and trendy because you don't want the gay community to attack you if you're against chopping little boys' genitals off.
[55:39.000 --> 55:43.000]  I mean, this is just like a psycho movie on PCP and 14 hits of acid.
[55:43.000 --> 55:45.000]  We'll be right back.
[55:45.000 --> 55:51.000]  Again, I don't like to lecture people I'm a very private person, but because of the globalists and their attack on humanity,
[55:51.000 --> 55:54.000]  I've been forced the last 27 years to be a public figure.
[55:54.000 --> 55:58.000]  And we've given the globalists one hell of a run for their money because of God.
[55:58.000 --> 56:02.000]  And I know some of our listeners get mad when I talk about God all day,
[56:02.000 --> 56:03.000]  but just give me a break.
[56:03.000 --> 56:04.000]  The Satanism's out in the open.
[56:04.000 --> 56:09.000]  I've always been a Christian, but now the fact that it's a fight between good and evil is so clear.
[56:09.000 --> 56:10.000]  And I get it.
[56:10.000 --> 56:12.000]  A lot of you have been turned off by big churches.
[56:12.000 --> 56:17.000]  A lot of you have been turned off by the corrupt priest class system, and I get it, me too.
[56:17.000 --> 56:18.000]  Believe me, I'm one of them.
[56:18.000 --> 56:25.000]  But it's that relationship with God and just God's universe that God created that is so essential.
[56:25.000 --> 56:30.000]  And God created the universe for us to have communion with God through and to have life.
[56:30.000 --> 56:32.000]  And so that's what M-Full Wars is really all about.

[57:45.000 --> 58:05.000]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[58:05.000 --> 58:34.000]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[58:34.000 --> 58:49.000]  You're always on my mind.
[58:49.000 --> 58:54.000]  Welcome back to the Global Transmission.
[58:54.000 --> 58:58.000]  Alright, we got loaded phone lines here where people want to call in with their experiences with the vaccine.
[58:58.000 --> 59:01.000]  I'm not screening your calls. If you love it, tell me. If it didn't do anything, tell me.
[59:01.000 --> 59:07.000]  If it made you sick or hurt somebody you know or helps somebody you know, we'd love to hear from you.
[59:07.000 --> 59:14.000]  I got to be honest with you. I ran into somebody that I've known for a long time that I've worked with yesterday.
[59:14.000 --> 59:21.000]  And I'd seen him just about a month ago, and he didn't look good.
[59:21.000 --> 59:25.000]  And he looked older, and he seemed foggy.
[59:25.000 --> 59:29.000]  And his skin kind of had a way of hanging on his face.
[59:29.000 --> 59:34.000]  And I said, did you take the vaccine? Did you take the mRNA?
[59:34.000 --> 59:38.000]  And he said, yeah, I took the Moderna and sold my wife and sold my children.
[59:38.000 --> 59:44.000]  His children are grown up, but recently married.
[59:44.000 --> 59:51.000]  I said, interesting, I didn't say you look like hell.
[59:51.000 --> 59:53.000]  And his father recently died.
[59:53.000 --> 1:00:04.000]  I couldn't help myself. I said, did your dad take it? And he said, no.
[1:00:04.000 --> 1:00:08.000]  Dad died of pneumonia.
[1:00:08.000 --> 1:00:10.000]  And you know, there are a lot of serious pneumonias out there.
[1:00:10.000 --> 1:00:12.000]  Actually, there's a lot more than the flu.
[1:00:12.000 --> 1:00:18.000]  But see, they can never make a vaccine for the pneumonia because it's a bunch of cold viruses that just get in your lungs.
[1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:23.000]  And if you did, it creates a protein that the rest of your body has and starts attacking your body,
[1:00:23.000 --> 1:00:31.000]  which is what all these giant studies that I've got right here show me.
[1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:34.000]  You know, part of the reason my head's spinning is they bring me so many documents.
[1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:36.000]  They bring me so much proof.
[1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:38.000]  I'm going to go to your phone calls. We start the next segment.
[1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:41.000]  I don't want to cut anybody off. I appreciate folks holding.
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:46.000]  But I had those two studies here out at UT.
[1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:48.000]  They're in the stack good.
[1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:55.000]  And just that, just that, it's hard to cover anything else when you got that.
[1:00:55.000 --> 1:01:00.000]  I sent this to a individual I know that is high up in the board.
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:02.000]  Let's just say, well, I gave way too much.
[1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:08.000]  Let's say heads up a department at the University of Texas last night.
[1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:11.000]  And I know this person for a long time.
[1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  And when I send him text messages, they usually don't respond for like a week.
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:18.000]  He responded back in about 20 minutes.
[1:01:18.000 --> 1:01:30.000]  And I said, hey, UT put out this big study under a federal government grant nine years ago that.
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  And I said, tell me what you think of it.
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:36.000]  I didn't even say they said it was bad.
[1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:40.000]  Don't take COVID based vaccines.
[1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:42.000]  This is 2012.
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  And he said, hey, UT put out this interesting report on COVID type viruses nine years ago.
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:51.000]  What do you think?
[1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:53.000]  I'll show you the text.
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:55.000]  I won't show you the name.
[1:01:55.000 --> 1:01:58.000]  And he texted me back like 10 minutes later.
[1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:01.000]  And he said, well, it's very technical.
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:05.000]  But obviously.
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:07.000]  I'm not taking the vaccine.
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:09.000]  And this is a warning.
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:12.000]  And then he went on to tell me that his medical doctor told him don't take the vaccine.
[1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  In fact, let me just show you the text because it's just so interesting that.
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  You know, they tell the general public everybody should do this.
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  But here's somebody high up in the UT system.
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:23.000]  Very respected.
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:27.000]  The biggest university in the world.
[1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:31.000]  They find it.
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:35.000]  That we make sure you can't see the name on here.
[1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:38.000]  Go ahead and overhead shot real quick.
[1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:40.000]  Look at this.
[1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  Overhead shot, please.
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:45.000]  My doctor recommended that I not get vaccinated.
[1:02:45.000 --> 1:02:48.000]  She said it had unnecessary risk associated with it.
[1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:54.000]  And because I already had a high level of antibodies from having had COVID, there was no need to take the risk.
[1:02:54.000 --> 1:03:04.000]  The article 14 months ago, I told you that the global lockdown was going to kill tens of millions of people by starvation and was going to cause a global depression in the first world.
[1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:06.000]  And now it has.
[1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:14.000]  And I'm going to say to you, if you're a foreigner, then that you should get high quality, storeable food and save it because it is insurance you can eat.
[1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:18.000]  And with all the inflation we knew was coming, that was one way to be inflation.
[1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:19.000]  A lot of you listened.
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:20.000]  You did a great job.
[1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:21.000]  Some of you didn't.
[1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:25.000]  Now is the time to take action before food prices only continue to increase.
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:27.000]  Every index shows it.
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:30.000]  It's basically a guarantee barring a miracle.
[1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  And we wish it wasn't the case.
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:34.000]  But let's make lemonade out of these lemons.
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:37.000]  And we'll be buying more until next Wednesday, May 12th.
[1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  You can get 2020 prices still at preparewithalex.com.
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:47.000]  And then the prices are going to have to go back to what they were still lower than most major competitors.
[1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:49.000]  And the food is the highest quality you're going to find.
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:56.000]  Alex.com. Take action now. Prepare with Alex.com. Secure your food while you still can.
[1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:38.000]  All right. I tend to start each broadcast in the last year and a few months, 14 months or so, with the martial law, with the COVID-19, with the checkpoints, with the lockdowns, with the police state, because it's the big globalist move.
[1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:52.000]  And tied to that is economic collapse, third world population surging into our borders, universal incomes, just the whole new world order agenda of Agenda 21, Agenda 2030.
[1:04:52.000 --> 1:05:00.000]  It's the big enchilada. Everything comes out of the center of the wheel. Everything else is a spoke of that. This is their big move.
[1:05:00.000 --> 1:05:14.000]  But today I didn't do that. I started the broadcast with organized rioting around the world by communist forces. And after I take phone calls for everybody on the board, I'm going to get into incredible footage from all over the world of Antifa acting as police,
[1:05:14.000 --> 1:05:23.000]  pulling people out of cars, threatening them at gunpoint, and the police watching do nothing. This is anarchy. This is lawlessness. This is exactly what the left planned.
[1:05:23.000 --> 1:05:33.000]  Intimidate, bully the police so bad that if they do their job, they'll be put in prison, that they stand down, and then the left can take over, then they'll get control of the police department.
[1:05:33.000 --> 1:05:41.000]  So you watch this Antifa footage, we're going to be playing you. They're like, get out of the car, put your hands up, I'm going to kill you right now if you don't.
[1:05:41.000 --> 1:05:56.000]  And they sound like out of control cops or cops that just stopped the bank robber. They've all been watching cop shows, but it's a bunch of woke, you know, leftists and trendies, literally engaged in like al-Qaeda checkpoints,
[1:05:56.000 --> 1:06:05.000]  like al-Qaeda sets these up in Afghanistan and Syria and stops people and does this, and they beat him up and drag him away. I mean, it's the police standing and watching.
[1:06:05.000 --> 1:06:13.000]  And then the guy pulls a gun and then the media is like, how dare him? And then while they beat him, they go, how dare you? How dare you?
[1:06:13.000 --> 1:06:20.000]  So it goes on and on. That's coming up. But let me hit this as I go to your calls.
[1:06:20.000 --> 1:06:35.000]  This is a University of Texas major study financed by the federal government when they were trying to see if COVID family, SARS family, COVID-19 family viruses could be stopped with a vaccine. They found all the lab rats got sick.
[1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:45.000]  Many died in a major study with three different vaccine types. And that was in 2012 when they said you shouldn't try to make a vaccine of this for humans.
[1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:58.000]  You should proceed with extreme caution. And that's titled immunization. SARS coronavirus vaccine leads to pulmonary immunopathology of challenge with the SARS virus.
[1:06:58.000 --> 1:07:04.000]  And the challenge is the group of rats that were given the vaccine versus those that aren't.
[1:07:04.000 --> 1:07:15.000]  And they developed autoimmune responses and their hearts and lungs swell up and they got bloody holes in them and they died of blood clots, which I'm sure you're hearing about in the news.
[1:07:15.000 --> 1:07:22.000]  With all these so-called vaccines, they all make your body that attack a standard protein, attack itself.
[1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:29.000]  So that's one of the big things this is doing. It's not debatable. This is a smoking gun. It's posted again at infowars.com.
[1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:34.000]  I hope you share it. You can find it on the UT website for yourself. You can find it. A bunch of other studies that are similar.
[1:07:34.000 --> 1:07:44.000]  This is a well-known fact. It's how top scientists in December followed an emergency injunction with the EU begging them to stop this, citing other studies just like this.
[1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:49.000]  So this is like a well-known thing, like taking cyanide kills you or smoking cigarettes gives you lung cancer.
[1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:58.000]  You take this stuff, it's going to give you autoimmune problems. Some people are really allergic to a bee sting, some aren't. Some are really allergic to this, some aren't.
[1:07:58.000 --> 1:08:03.000]  And that's an oversimplification calling it allergic, but your body attacks itself.
[1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:09.000]  You become allergic to yourself and reject yourself. Like you get an organ from somebody else, your body rejects it.
[1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:13.000]  Unless you take anti-rejection drugs that lower your immune system.
[1:08:13.000 --> 1:08:16.000]  So they're making you sick for life. It's so diabolical.
[1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:21.000]  But I remember about two years ago they introduced a bill the Democrats did, and Frank Lunt supported it.
[1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:31.000]  It was like he supports OxyContin. And you can pull this up. They said, we want to get rid of inserts on vaccines because they have fact sheets that lie to you.
[1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:33.000]  They go, oh, it's all safe. It's good. Here's a fact sheet.
[1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:43.000]  But they have like Bible paper that's folded up in each little ampule of the vaccines by law since the 50s that has all the animal studies, what it did, what they found.
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:54.000]  Yeah, there's a photo of one right there. And my gosh, if you get an MMR one or you get a hepatitis one that says it can kill you, give you diabetes, if you get on the raise, give you epilepsy, give you cancer.
[1:08:54.000 --> 1:08:58.000]  I mean, wow, it's scary.
[1:08:58.000 --> 1:09:06.000]  Made rats autoimmune system shut down. I mean, MMR, it doesn't matter what they are. They all have just a laundry list of bad side effects.
[1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:09.000]  It's coming. The devil gives you fine print. They don't read that fine print.
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:15.000]  Well, guess what? They've done that here. I didn't even realize this. We're going to show you the most incredible bombshell video.
[1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:23.000]  It's up on infowars.com in the live show feed. Under my show, we're posting it there for you to find it.
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:32.000]  It's a totally sick joke. They didn't even not include it under the emergency authorization because no studies were done.
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:40.000]  They give you a blank sheet of paper. So right now, by law, they're supposed to give you these rob new or somebody that's assertive.
[1:09:40.000 --> 1:09:48.000]  Go to Walgreens or CVS and say, hi, I'm like an insert of the vaccine by law. You're supposed to give it to me.
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  And they've got stacks of them in the trash can because they're giving shots all day.
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:55.000]  So they're probably in the trash outside because they're giving them shots outside the window.
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:10:05.000]  Just get me one now. I've got to show people this because I made a call this morning and confirmed this is true with Moderna,
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:16.000]  Pfizer, J&J, all of it. For a little carton of milk or orange juice or apple juice or grape juice,
[1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  you've got the facts and the nutrition and the servings and the carbohydrates. You know, it's got it all right there.
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:34.000]  The proteins, it has nothing. It has nothing. And then, oh, Snoop says it's safe and effective, totally tested.
[1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:41.000]  They're like, they need to take Tucker Carlson and Alex Jones off the gear. They should be arrested. They're saying this isn't tested. Those liars.
[1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:52.000]  So, ladies and gentlemen, I give you this incredible footage. Pharmacist shows COVID vaccine insert. It must be magic because the insert is blank.
[1:10:52.000 --> 1:10:58.000]  There's no paper trail to track the attack. No paper trail to see what they hit you with. No warning. And it's in the general public.
[1:10:58.000 --> 1:11:05.000]  So the genie's out of the bottle. Everybody gets real. You had to do this because people aren't going to know what hit them now.
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:11.000]  And it's Cardio Vascular. Here it is.
[1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:19.000]  All right. I'm going to make this video for you because I had to video it so that you'll believe me because, frankly, I can't believe it myself.
[1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:30.000]  So, here's a brand new sealed, perfectly sealed brand new box of the J&J vaccine.
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:58.000]  You can see here, I'm going to break this open. And perfectly on top is this perfectly normal package insert.
[1:11:58.000 --> 1:12:21.000]  It's a lot of safety and efficacy data. In fact, all of the normal information that we would find in a package insert, like the ingredients, that would all be found right here in the package insert.
[1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  Must be magic. It's all blank. The whole thing.
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:42.000]  Except for this part. That's the only thing not blank. Are you kidding me?
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:52.000]  This is a new type of war. This is World War Four. The Cold War was World War Three. This is a biological depopulation war.
[1:12:52.000 --> 1:13:04.000]  They all got caught with the pedophiles. They already had this plan down the road a few years. They launched the plan early as an emergency against us to totally change our view to the collapse.
[1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:14.000]  So, warn your family. Warn everyone now. They're lying to you. This is so out of control. We're going to go to break it. I promise. Nicole and Brian, we're going to write to you.
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:25.000]  And then everybody else, like Creed and Nelson and John and Jeff and Ed and Charlene and Sarah, every one of you, bam, bam, bam, you're going to be able to tell your story to the world.
[1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:43.000]  But you just saw that incredible footage that we're posting under the live show feed of today's live show with the headline up there about the fact that the globalist are imploding our planet and are waging war against us, but that there are ways to stop them.
[1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:54.000]  I'm Alex Jones, one of the main fighters in the human resistance against the globalist takeover. Thank you so much for your support. God bless you. We'll be right back on the other side.
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:14:08.000]  The equation is very simple. The mega banks control the media. They control big pharma. They control academia. They control the military, industrial complex. They control big tech.
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:17.000]  And everywhere that they have been in control in the third world, the hip step is absolute total despotism and dehumanization.
[1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:26.000]  It is the Western Christian idea of human freedom that ended slavery and that promoted women's rights and so much more that actually threatens them.
[1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:41.000]  So because they can't defeat that empowering ethic, they instead co-opted, turned it upside down and use the idea of equality to actually destroy human freedom and the free market that threatens their monopoly, so control.
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:51.000]  That's why they target info wars because we understand the keys to defeating them. The only way our transmission gets out is if you promote info wars and ban that video.
[1:14:51.000 --> 1:15:12.000]  So redouble your efforts. We're all in this together.
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:24.000]  Please smoke wall of fire dot com.
[1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:55.000]  That's handgun conversion dot com.
[1:15:55.000 --> 1:16:01.000]  It is a big idea. A new world order.
[1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:06.000]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world.
[1:16:06.000 --> 1:16:12.000]  It's known as the builder bird. Could their objective be world domination?
[1:16:12.000 --> 1:16:24.000]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is in hand.
[1:16:24.000 --> 1:16:31.000]  The globalist fear this film made 14 years ago. It is the blueprint for their plan to figure the world. It is the blueprint for the great reset. It is in game.
[1:16:31.000 --> 1:16:42.000]  Blueprint for global enslavement available right now at infowarstore.com with a zero country code meaning you can make copies of it anywhere in the world. I strongly suggest you get the film in game at infowarstore.com.
[1:16:42.000 --> 1:16:50.000]  I strongly suggest you make copies and share it. And if you take that action, I demand you tell others you've given a copy to that they make copies and share it as well.
[1:16:50.000 --> 1:16:55.000]  That will trigger distribution by proxy meaning we the people cannot be stopped.
[1:16:55.000 --> 1:17:05.000]  So what's the most important part? Let's say in a bulldozer running over the globalist. The treads, the wheels, the engine, the scoop on the front. It's all very important, but the fuel is paramount.
[1:17:05.000 --> 1:17:07.000]  And that's my allegor.
[1:17:07.000 --> 1:17:18.000]  Turbo force is vitamins, minerals, amino acids that synergistically work with six different natural forms of healthy clean energy that last for 10 hours in the average metabolic system metabolism of a human.
[1:17:18.000 --> 1:17:26.000]  Some people get 15 hours out of it. Some people get about eight hours, but people take this people taking sports. People cannot believe it's the best they've ever had because it's not high.
[1:17:26.000 --> 1:17:35.000]  Nobody puts as much product into their pre workouts, their post workouts. You can call us whatever you want. It's a total solution all around the best you're going to find.
[1:17:35.000 --> 1:17:45.000]  Turbo force. Without you, we don't roll. With you, we search forward together. It's like a bulldozer without the diesel fuel. If we don't have your financial support, we will be defeated.
[1:17:45.000 --> 1:17:55.000]  You support us to get products you already need that literally fuel your body and your mind. It's a win-win, 360 together, infowarstore.com, or AAA-253-3139.
[1:18:15.000 --> 1:18:43.000]  I'm a sleep between a monkey and all my friends and juniors.
[1:18:43.000 --> 1:19:03.000]  So now all the major vaccine makers with these mRNA franken shots are not even putting on the inserts anything, not the ingredients, not any studies, not any testing because it wasn't done.
[1:19:03.000 --> 1:19:19.000]  It's all blank, no paper trail. But under other names, they did do the studies. They did do the test on a bunch of different coronaviruses. And here's the University of Texas nine years ago with the SARS coronavirus family with rats, three different vaccines.
[1:19:19.000 --> 1:19:29.000]  The rats died with blood clots in their lungs, in their brains and their hearts. And they say, don't create vaccines for humans with this because it attacks proteins in the body.
[1:19:29.000 --> 1:19:39.000]  So there are the facts. But there's no paper trail now because they won't even tell you what was ever in the shot. And they're fighting to keep that secret.
[1:19:39.000 --> 1:19:53.000]  Unbelievable. Let's go to your phone calls. Nicole, Brian, others. Nicole's husband is a nurse vaccine dangers. We also have Brian was talking about vaccine reactions, sisters of doc, parents.
[1:19:53.000 --> 1:19:59.000]  Nicole, thank you for holding with us and being here. Welcome. Tell us your view on this.
[1:19:59.000 --> 1:20:09.000]  Hi, Alex. Good to talk to you. This is a full circle moment for me because I grew up watching you on table access and Austin. So I just want to say God bless for giving you the strength to fight the good fight for so long.
[1:20:09.000 --> 1:20:11.000]  Well, God bless you. You're awesome.
[1:20:11.000 --> 1:20:23.000]  Yeah. Okay. So I just wanted to preface this by saying that so my husband's a nurse. He's a phenomenal nurse. He was nominated for a nurse theory at a hospital. He knew stuff. What he's talking about.
[1:20:23.000 --> 1:20:39.000]  And so he was a bad reaction from the vaccine as the test has started to fold in on himself and he was waiting and he almost died. We were able to recover him and save his life. And ever since that incident, we learned that the science behind vaccines isn't that credible.
[1:20:39.000 --> 1:20:54.000]  So we started talking to people about it and reading the inserts and talking about everything fast forward to today. My mother in law got the COVID Moderna shot. She doesn't believe us about any of us know her grandson almost died.
[1:20:54.000 --> 1:21:13.000]  And now she has a lipoma on her breast a week after her vaccination, which is the post vaccine induced lipoma, which is now the tested positive for breast cancer. So a week after the shot, the slump shows up and no breast cancer, which is super scary.
[1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:24.000]  And by the way, they're telling people that you're going to get what looks like breast cancer, but it's okay. You don't have an operation, but women are going in and it's cancer. And they admit in the uterus and the breast.
[1:21:24.000 --> 1:21:32.000]  That's mainstream news. That's about six months in England. Now it's confirmed all over the world. My God, this is like a nightmare injection.
[1:21:32.000 --> 1:21:33.000]  Right. Right.
[1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:36.000]  What is she saying now that she has breast cancer?
[1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:46.000]  She's still pro vaccine. She said, yeah, the vaccine gave me the breast cancer, but I'm still pro vaccine. It's very bizarre. It's very bizarre.
[1:21:46.000 --> 1:21:58.000]  Well, they've been programmed. What's happened is they've been hypnotized. A lot of the public scientifically is not in a pure suggested state. They're not purely hypnotized, but they're almost there kind of like in a daydream.
[1:21:58.000 --> 1:22:03.000]  And so we more and more, we've got to work on techniques to try to get people out of their trance.
[1:22:03.000 --> 1:22:10.000]  Well, here's, here's the point on what you make. If you read, you're talking about insert, insert 13.1 of any vaccine that you receive.
[1:22:10.000 --> 1:22:17.000]  This product has not been tested for carcinogenic, eugenic or infer or fertility effects.
[1:22:17.000 --> 1:22:25.000]  So you think of those three industries as individuals, right? Cancer, autoimmune disease and fertility.
[1:22:25.000 --> 1:22:29.000]  Those are big businesses, especially if we're giving those shots to our children.
[1:22:29.000 --> 1:22:31.000]  That's right. Giving you cancer, giving you infertility.
[1:22:31.000 --> 1:22:37.000]  You're so smart. Explain that to people that there's nothing on the insert. They won't tell you what's in it, but hey, it might hurt your fertility.
[1:22:37.000 --> 1:22:40.000]  It might give you cancer. It might give you a heart attack.
[1:22:40.000 --> 1:22:45.000]  Right. But at least you don't get this random disease that you can easily recover from.
[1:22:45.000 --> 1:22:52.000]  If you've ever really true research any of these vaccines, which is worse, your child getting cancer or your child.
[1:22:52.000 --> 1:22:54.000]  Well, that's why you got to talk to everybody with the logic.
[1:22:54.000 --> 1:23:02.000]  What this lady is saying is the logic that can save millions of lives and stop the takeover because they're already announcing that they're coming out with the booster shot.
[1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:11.000]  That's a patch that then marks you and it's saying Pfizer scientists expect elderly people with underlying conditions to be first to get COVID vaccine boosters.
[1:23:11.000 --> 1:23:17.000]  And they say at least five shots a year. Then it'll be 10 shots a year. This is a total takeover.
[1:23:17.000 --> 1:23:28.000]  Right. And I think what we're about to see is since they're starting to pass this bio weapon on the children, it's not a vaccine. It's a bio up and it doesn't meet any of the criteria for the normal vaccine.
[1:23:28.000 --> 1:23:41.000]  If people are going to give this to their children, knowing that these children have been pumped, so it's more vaccines than any other generation, you're about to watch like the deaths of children on a massive scale.
[1:23:41.000 --> 1:23:45.000]  I totally agree. Nicole, amazing. Thank you for joining us. I appreciate it.
[1:23:45.000 --> 1:23:54.000]  I'm going to go to Brian next. Listen, every listener needs to get this report that I'll have reposted in today's live show feed.
[1:23:54.000 --> 1:24:06.000]  And share everyone, you know, and the nurse showing the inserts blank. This is life and death, your whole email list, your text messages, your friends, your family, your neighbors, go to the local city council, go to the local school board.
[1:24:06.000 --> 1:24:17.000]  Read just the first page of this that any type of coronavirus vaccine in University of Texas studies killed the rats with blood plots, massive numbers.
[1:24:17.000 --> 1:24:23.000]  They said, don't do it. Everybody's got to get this out.
[1:24:23.000 --> 1:24:29.000]  I'm going to drive around with an armored vehicle to the left. It will attack you in Austin and I'm going to bullhorn this.
[1:24:29.000 --> 1:24:35.000]  I'm posting it in the live show feed. It's also an info wars.com.
[1:24:35.000 --> 1:24:41.000]  All right, let's get another caller and Brian, thank you for holding you're a trooper. You're awesome from North Carolina. Go ahead.
[1:24:41.000 --> 1:24:47.000]  Hi, it's pleasure to be on the first time caller. I will keep it short and brief. I know you're a busy man.
[1:24:47.000 --> 1:25:04.000]  So first off, my sister is a physical therapist. She was recently visiting her and my brother, who is also a pharmacist, both reported that there's seeing new patients weekly that present with paralysis in their limbs or neurodegenerative disease.
[1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:10.000]  Within 24 to 48 hours of receiving the shot.
[1:25:10.000 --> 1:25:12.000]  Incredible. Please continue.
[1:25:12.000 --> 1:25:27.000]  Okay, so on top of that, the way they have their reporting systems set up in these healthcare systems, they don't have a way to report the vaccine as being an effect of these symptoms because it's set up so they cannot report it that way.
[1:25:27.000 --> 1:25:38.000]  So that's why you're not seeing as many reports of adverse effects. The bears is about the only thing to go off of and the majority of people I feel like just really don't even know that that's there.
[1:25:38.000 --> 1:25:46.000]  Exactly. That's why they estimate it's probably 100 to one. So if you've got 4,000 deaths on bars, bears, it's probably 100,000.
[1:25:46.000 --> 1:25:57.000]  Exactly. And my other, other question, which I haven't really seen anybody talking about this is the vaccines are self spreading and there's been research in that. I'm sure you're well aware.
[1:25:57.000 --> 1:26:01.000]  Over 20 years ago, project posts in the apartheid government.
[1:26:01.000 --> 1:26:06.000]  There's been research on using vaccines as bio weapons.
[1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:18.000]  That's right. I forgot to get into that. I showed it on air last week. You guys reprint me just type in South Africa plan to use self spreading vaccines as bio weapon operation post. Yes.
[1:26:18.000 --> 1:26:30.000]  So my question is that these vaccines are self spreading is avoiding the shot really enough to avoid what is essentially a medical rape of your protein synthesis.
[1:26:30.000 --> 1:26:38.000]  That's why they give you have really powerful vitamins and minerals. It won't be able to replicate as much in the mitochondria. And that's just speculation.
[1:26:38.000 --> 1:26:48.000]  We know you have to have that. Our virus is going to leg up. This is synthetic, synthetic biology. So I don't know. I'll get some scientists on. But yeah, this is a plague, plague of Satan.
[1:26:48.000 --> 1:26:54.000]  God bless you sir. Brian. Thank you. Back in a few minutes. We'll go right back to your calls.
[1:26:54.000 --> 1:27:05.000]  All of the experts agree that getting proper sleep is the cornerstone of good health. It has been proven that a poor sleep schedule is linked with numerous health problems, including weight gain, memory issues, mood changes,
[1:27:05.000 --> 1:27:24.000]  poor concentration, and even a weakened immune system. Introducing Rocket Rest, the new product from our Dr. Jones Naturals line at infowarstore.com.

[1:27:54.000 --> 1:28:12.000]  Listeners have rightfully been complaining the last six months or so saying, where are most of the best selling products you have that we love? And my answer is the supply chain has broken down. I have to either reformulate or I have to lower the quality to get a lot of these. And so that's why we don't have a lot of products in.
[1:28:12.000 --> 1:28:24.000]  Info Wars is in financial trouble is because if we had the product, you would be buying it. We have the money, but so many of them have been sold out. Just like you noticed, a lot of other items at the store aren't available because civilization is being artificially imploded.
[1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:37.000]  But finally, X2 is back in stock with a good halogen, deep earth crystal iodine, so essential in your body. It's really the missing link. It's 50% off. We've got a big shipment of it at infowarstore.com.
[1:28:37.000 --> 1:28:47.000]  Now when it gets ready to sell out, we'll have to go back to near full price, take advantage of this now, stock up, and don't forget to take your X2 because I have a tendency to forget how great it is and not take it myself.
[1:28:47.000 --> 1:29:13.000]  But when I do stamina, libido, energy weight loss, it's incredible. It's essential. It's X2 at infowarstore.com.
[1:29:13.000 --> 1:29:23.000]  According to ancient Samoan legend, kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa, who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[1:29:23.000 --> 1:29:29.000]  The Samoan people would drink kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to loosen up a little.
[1:29:29.000 --> 1:29:34.000]  Nowadays, kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[1:29:34.000 --> 1:29:47.000]  A new kava chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only kava kava, but other herbs including, but not limited to, German chamomile, organic skullcap, and valerian roots.
[1:29:47.000 --> 1:30:05.000]  We'll be back to sell this new product quickly, so be sure to secure yours by visiting infowarstore.com.
[1:30:17.000 --> 1:30:27.000]  We'll be back to sell this new product quickly, so be sure to secure yours by visiting infowarstore.com.
[1:30:47.000 --> 1:31:09.000]  A three-year-old, but now that this is the best-known song, is alive. Christians stole God from the Muslims? What the hell does that mean?
[1:31:09.000 --> 1:31:24.000]  But again, Satan hates Christ. Amazing. Christianity predates Islam by 400 years. Amazing.
[1:31:24.000 --> 1:31:32.000]  But the left sycophantically loves Islam because it'll be the authoritarian sword they believe that slits the throat of Europe and the United States.
[1:31:32.000 --> 1:31:42.000]  Welcome back, I'm Alex Jones, your host. Since the caller mentioned it, wow, two callers, both of which have family that are medical workers, about people coming in paralyzed from the vaccines.
[1:31:42.000 --> 1:31:50.000]  They all know it, but there's no way for hospitals to report it. The people have to report it themselves, and hospitals tell them don't do it.
[1:31:50.000 --> 1:32:02.000]  And another caller mentioned the same things happening at the hospitals. Look at this, apartheid era South African covert program. Project COS stopped to weaponize vaccines.
[1:32:02.000 --> 1:32:17.000]  Could COVID-19 be used the same way? Vaccinedests.com. Well, Israel actually bought this project, what was the other one called? Project Green from the South Africans and tried to use it on the Palestinians.
[1:32:17.000 --> 1:32:27.000]  I mean, that's just the fact. Well, you like Israel, hate Israel or neutral on it. This goes on. And governments, the Russians got caught testing on their people. The Chinese do it constantly.
[1:32:27.000 --> 1:32:37.000]  England does it. The Germans did it. The US is famous for it. And we're just supposed to just trust them when the vaccine inserts are blank because they're not vaccines.
[1:32:37.000 --> 1:32:47.000]  You're like, well, how do they get away with it? It's all a giant test. They get the media on board, the doctors on board at the top, and now they've all committed a crime.
[1:32:47.000 --> 1:32:55.000]  Joseph Goebbels called that and Heinrich Himmler called that the cement of blood. Those are the right hand men of Hitler.
[1:32:55.000 --> 1:33:09.000]  Herman Goering was like a side note. And they said, we get our men to commit these atrocities at first. And once they've been corrupted, they'll do anything we tell them. It's called the cement of blood.
[1:33:09.000 --> 1:33:20.000]  Like any gang, why does a gang, whether it's a white supremacist gang or the Hispanic gang, whatever the gang is, motorcycle gang that's a 3% or 1% or whatever we call them.
[1:33:20.000 --> 1:33:27.000]  I mean, a 3% are like the start of the Revolutionary War and wanted, I mean, you know, a small percent or outlaw motorcycle gangs, criminal gangs.
[1:33:27.000 --> 1:33:36.000]  You got to go kill somebody to be even in the club. And you got to do something really bad to be a higher level member because the higher levels you didn't know, they got dirt on your ass.
[1:33:36.000 --> 1:33:45.000]  And that's all this is, is a commitment into pure hell. I mean, you talk about a crime, folks. It's one thing to kill the old people.
[1:33:45.000 --> 1:33:53.000]  You know, there's an argument there. I don't support it. But the left says, you know, the case for killing granny, Ezekiel Immanuel that wrote Obamacare says we're not going to give old people health care.
[1:33:53.000 --> 1:34:00.000]  I'll give him eye surgery and knee surgery. He laughs about it because he's liberal. And so we're going to hurt old people. I'm liberal. I'm liberal. Sorry.
[1:34:00.000 --> 1:34:08.000]  You know, the ADL will get you if you don't like it. George Thoreau says the Nazi. Well, the ADL will get you if you say it.
[1:34:08.000 --> 1:34:19.000]  Okay, okay. So that's how this works. I'm going back to your phone calls, but these people are sick. And now they're going to target the little children and mess them up for life.
[1:34:19.000 --> 1:34:31.000]  Oh, man. Wow. I'm like, Oh, suddenly all these kids have heart problems and have brain problems. Well, hasn't so conspiracy theorists say it's connected to the vaccine.
[1:34:31.000 --> 1:34:39.000]  No, the University of Texas says don't do it. It'll happen. But you don't care that young rats and old rats got sick and died.
[1:34:39.000 --> 1:34:48.000]  Because you're liberal. You're saving the earth for yourselves. All right. Who's been holding the longest here? I really appreciate everybody holding.
[1:34:48.000 --> 1:34:58.000]  Is it Ed? Is it Jeff? Let's just go in the order they've received here. Let's just go to Jeff in New York. Thanks for holding Jeff. Go ahead.
[1:34:58.000 --> 1:35:05.000]  Alex, hopefully you can hear me. This is Jeff in Long Island from Long Island, New York, about 20 miles outside of Manhattan.
[1:35:05.000 --> 1:35:22.000]  I just want to preface this by saying thank you, Professor Jones, for providing us with really an invaluable education, your coverage of geopolitics, economics, even just in time inventory, supply chain concerns, fiat currency issues, skyrocketing commodities.
[1:35:22.000 --> 1:35:31.000]  I personally work in the financial industry with a finance undergrad and I'm working on an MBA and your education is truly unbeatable in comparison.
[1:35:31.000 --> 1:35:42.000]  So yeah, long story short, my girlfriend of six years, it's our anniversary today. And we just heard that we're having our first baby.
[1:35:42.000 --> 1:35:49.000]  And long story short, her Israeli gynecologist is recommending that she gets a vaccine in the second trimester.
[1:35:49.000 --> 1:36:01.000]  So as soon as I heard that, really my heart sank and my reaction was we can never see this doctor again and really no way in hell, especially since her uncle just a couple of weeks ago got his first vaccination.
[1:36:01.000 --> 1:36:09.000]  And within hours, he had a heart attack and he was pushed off to the emergency room within an hour after the shot.
[1:36:09.000 --> 1:36:21.000]  Sir, not only can you not use that doctor, you've got to go public. You're doing it now on air. You've done it. You're a leader. Everybody's a leader. And just warn as many people as you can because we're tough as hardworking people.
[1:36:21.000 --> 1:36:28.000]  They know conservatives and patriots and nationalists aren't going to complain about stuff, but everyone I know has family getting sick from the shots.
[1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:34.000]  So we've got to get this information explained to them. It's not going to be on the nightly news.
[1:36:34.000 --> 1:36:41.000]  It's actually pointing towards Israel. Oh, Israel's totally got it under control. Look what they're doing. They're giving it to pregnant women.
[1:36:41.000 --> 1:36:48.000]  And I said, you really have no concept of really what's going on. You're just repeating pure propaganda.
[1:36:48.000 --> 1:36:53.000]  Oh, I know a lady from New Zealand and I told her, I said, take your mask off and she's, and I've known her for a while and she goes, no.
[1:36:53.000 --> 1:36:58.000]  And she goes, by the way, we all wore our mask and now we can have them off in New Zealand. I'm moving back to New Zealand.
[1:36:58.000 --> 1:37:07.000]  And I said, you watch within a month, they'll be back in their mask. The lockdown will be back and it was. So again, it's all psychological manipulation of be on the winning team by the bull.
[1:37:07.000 --> 1:37:10.000]  It's all a fraud. God bless you. Appreciate the call, Jeff.
[1:37:10.000 --> 1:37:19.000]  All right. Up next, let's go ahead and talk to Nelson in California. Thanks for holding Nelson. Go ahead.
[1:37:19.000 --> 1:37:21.000]  What's going on now? It's one time to talk.
[1:37:21.000 --> 1:37:31.000]  Yeah, man, I just wanted to touch base on the symptoms because I know four people personally, buddy of mine is a firefighter or the person at EMT.
[1:37:31.000 --> 1:37:44.000]  This teacher, I know she told me that her symptoms felt synthetic, which was very interesting to hear, meaning that she had all the symptoms minus congestion, kind of like the flu.
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:53.000]  And it's just interesting to hear that everybody that gets the second shot that they're horribly sick. The firefighter dude that I know said that he felt like crap.
[1:37:53.000 --> 1:38:00.000]  Like I said, I saw somebody I've been in business with for 10 years and I saw him a month ago and I saw him and I was like, what's that?
[1:38:00.000 --> 1:38:09.000]  I didn't want to say you look like hell. And he just took, he got his second shot last week. He didn't get sick from it. He just looks like he's 10 years old.
[1:38:09.000 --> 1:38:17.000]  Wow. Yeah, I know this other gentleman, he's 55 years old. He got a second shot. He was put out for like a week. His wife, same thing.
[1:38:17.000 --> 1:38:24.000]  And my dad, he's 68 now and, you know, kind of ask him, hey, are you thinking about getting a shot? He's like, oh, I'm not sure.
[1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:28.000]  And, you know, thanks to you guys, I get to send all this information to him.
[1:38:28.000 --> 1:38:39.000]  Because it's not so key say, I can't say educated, but just brainwash, I guess you could say, you know, and I just also want to make a plug as well with the products.
[1:38:39.000 --> 1:38:46.000]  A body's definitely helped me out and on it for about almost a year now. And my shoulder pain's gone. It's pretty awesome.
[1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:52.000]  And I remember buying three months of storeable food from you guys. And also I got the super water.
[1:38:52.000 --> 1:38:59.000]  Well, brother, you're not just on bodies. You are on the air. You are funding us to be on air and just keep bombarding your family.
[1:38:59.000 --> 1:39:03.000]  They're good people, so they project the goodness onto the evil globalist.
[1:39:03.000 --> 1:39:08.000]  Keep informing your dad, keep waking him up and point out, hey, dad, they even say you got to keep wearing the mask. It doesn't protect you.
[1:39:08.000 --> 1:39:13.000]  And now there's the booster shot. And so just, just, just, just keep hammering him. God bless you.
[1:39:13.000 --> 1:39:16.000]  And I appreciate your call. OK, this is going to happen.
[1:39:16.000 --> 1:39:22.000]  I'm going to take in this next 10 and a half minute segment or it's 10 minutes, 50 seconds long, I'm going to take nine calls.
[1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:26.000]  So I'm not going to tell you, thanks for calling. Don't tell me thanks. I want to get your testimony on air.
[1:39:26.000 --> 1:39:32.000]  We're going to go to break. And I'm going to go directly to your calls to Creed.
[1:39:32.000 --> 1:39:38.000]  And then Sarah, and then right down the line, I'm going to get to at least nine of your calls.
[1:39:38.000 --> 1:39:43.000]  Give each caller about a minute, 20 or so. And I really appreciate you all for calling.
[1:39:43.000 --> 1:39:47.000]  I just want to get you all on air. God have you sit there. I'm Alex Jones, infoawards.com.
[1:39:47.000 --> 1:40:14.000]  Tomorrow's news today. Please stay with us.
[1:40:17.000 --> 1:40:25.000]  The Western Christian idea of human freedom that ended slavery and that promoted women's rights and so much more that actually threatens them.
[1:40:25.000 --> 1:40:41.000]  So because they can't defeat that empowering ethic, they instead co-opted, turned it upside down and use the idea of equality to actually destroy human freedom and the free market that threatens their monopoly of control.
[1:40:41.000 --> 1:40:50.000]  And that's why they targeted info wars because we understand the keys to the freedom of the only way our transmission gets out is if you promote info wars and ban that video.

[1:41:53.000 --> 1:42:03.000]  14 months ago, I told you that the global lockdown was going to kill tens of millions of people by starvation and was going to cause a global depression in the first world.
[1:42:03.000 --> 1:42:11.000]  And now it has. It was a no brainer then that you should get high quality, storeable food and save it because it is insurance you can eat.
[1:42:11.000 --> 1:42:16.000]  And with all the inflation we knew was coming, that was one way to be inflation.
[1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:23.000]  A lot of you listened, you did a great job. Some of you didn't. Now is the time to take action before food prices only continue to increase.

[1:43:07.000 --> 1:43:23.000]  I'm a public figure, so I get to see things the general public doesn't get to see. And let me tell you, whether it's police chiefs or members of Congress or even folks in Hollywood or mainstream media or industry, people are really, really awakening the establishment.
[1:43:23.000 --> 1:43:30.000]  They don't want to go along with the globalist, but they're scared, they're looking for leadership. Well, that's where M4 comes in.

[1:45:29.000 --> 1:45:39.000]  Okay, let's go ahead and talk to John in Kentucky. Go ahead.
[1:45:39.000 --> 1:45:57.000]  Hey, Alex, a long time listener, God bless you. What's mind blowing is because these vaccines was pushed through by emergency use, the vaccine manufacturers do not have to disclose the ingredients.
[1:45:57.000 --> 1:46:07.000]  That's what people don't understand if it was actually FDA approved and they would have to disclose the ingredients in the vaccines.
[1:46:07.000 --> 1:46:12.000]  And then John Oliver lies and says it's all tested. No one's ever gotten sick when it's all a giant lie.
[1:46:12.000 --> 1:46:23.000]  Yeah, yeah, exactly. And also my wife's father, he's 54 healthy. We warned him against the vaccine, taking any of them.
[1:46:23.000 --> 1:46:37.000]  Two days after his second dose of the Moderna, he was admitted into the ICU, bleeding out internally somewhere. The doctors couldn't figure it out. I mean, this is uncharted waters we're dealing with here.
[1:46:37.000 --> 1:47:02.000]  The story is short. His kidneys were failing. Now he's on dialysis permanently. And my uncle, he just remarried his new wife's mother. They both got their vaccine back in February and she just passed away last week of a heart attack, but they're not putting two and two together and linking it with the vaccine.
[1:47:02.000 --> 1:47:11.000]  And it seems like right now when I'm scrolling through social media, somebody's sibling or grandparent or mother is sick and dying.
[1:47:11.000 --> 1:47:21.000]  And then Facebook shuts it down and that's the real crime and they will pay for what they've done. Absolutely, sir. Everybody has to tell their stories. Everybody's got to warn people and you're doing it right now.
[1:47:21.000 --> 1:47:32.000]  God bless you for holding to do that, John. I got to move quick. We're going to get to everybody and we're just taking calls. Unscreened here, folks. You know, if you've got a great vaccine story, call and let us know. Oh, what's the UT study say? Bleeding out.
[1:47:32.000 --> 1:47:44.000]  Your body eating holes in your cardiovascular system. And what are they calling in with? Bleeding out. Unbelievable. Bill Gates, they're committing a crime so horrible they think you won't admit it happened to you because you wouldn't.
[1:47:44.000 --> 1:47:53.000]  It's just too horrible. The government and big farmer would do this, but they have a long history of it. Creed in Oklahoma. Creed. Thanks for holding. Go ahead.
[1:47:53.000 --> 1:48:02.000]  Veteran Alex. My uncle works in a nursing home here in Oklahoma City and they have 50 residents. 48 took the vaccine and seven were dead within a week.
[1:48:02.000 --> 1:48:08.000]  You know, after seeing this, the nursing home company said, well, we'll give anyone that works here 100 bucks to take the vaccine.
[1:48:08.000 --> 1:48:14.000]  Of course, only one person, the whole unit decided to take the vaccine after seeing what happened to the old people.
[1:48:14.000 --> 1:48:24.000]  And, you know, I really woke my uncle up seeing that firsthand, you know, one, one seventh of his residents dropping dead after taking the vaccine a week later.
[1:48:24.000 --> 1:48:30.000]  And notice Stalin said one man dies. It's a tragedy. 10,000 dies of statistic. The globalist of all war games.
[1:48:30.000 --> 1:48:35.000]  They use Yale Harvard psychology departments to war game all this before they did it.
[1:48:35.000 --> 1:48:39.000]  Can you believe this? Oh, I can't believe it.
[1:48:39.000 --> 1:48:43.000]  Imagine taking this vaccine need for 100 bucks or a donut. Unbelievable.
[1:48:43.000 --> 1:48:46.000]  I have a separate story about my father-in-law, a healthy guy in his fifties.
[1:48:46.000 --> 1:48:51.000]  I warned him at Christmas with a Wolfgang Wudall report and eat on report.
[1:48:51.000 --> 1:48:55.000]  I warned him at Christmas. I said, man, do not take this vaccine. You're healthy. You're in your fifties.
[1:48:55.000 --> 1:48:59.000]  He takes no medication, no problems. Took the vaccine. Pfizer second dose.
[1:48:59.000 --> 1:49:05.000]  He was hospitalized because his blood pressure went to stroke level and he nearly died of a stroke, a heart attack.
[1:49:05.000 --> 1:49:11.000]  They got him in the hospital, got his blood pressure down and now he's on blood pressure medication indefinitely.
[1:49:11.000 --> 1:49:13.000]  So, I mean, his life has changed.
[1:49:13.000 --> 1:49:20.000]  That's right. Make us all sick and take over our bodies, sterilize us and make us take a bunch of drugs and try to get fatality back.
[1:49:20.000 --> 1:49:25.000]  But Pfizer says they've got boosters coming. You think your father-in-law is going to take his booster?
[1:49:25.000 --> 1:49:32.000]  Oh, I'm sure he will. And one thing I haven't heard mentioned on this show or anywhere else, rather, these vaccines are in clinical trials.
[1:49:32.000 --> 1:49:37.000]  And when you run clinical trials, don't you give the drug along with the placebo?
[1:49:37.000 --> 1:49:43.000]  So, I mean, do you think placebo's are in the test group? I mean, do you think they're not even doing testing?
[1:49:43.000 --> 1:49:48.000]  They're calling it general testing in the general public. That's why the vaccine inserts are clear.
[1:49:48.000 --> 1:49:51.000]  Thank you, Creed. God bless you. Say hi to your family.
[1:49:51.000 --> 1:49:58.000]  And by the way, I'm coming back Sunday night. The entire transmission, 4 to 8 p.m.
[1:49:58.000 --> 1:50:03.000]  I'm going to do four hours that night and we're cutting most of the ads in the last few hours. We're going to take your phone calls.
[1:50:03.000 --> 1:50:09.000]  And if you love the vaccine, write down the toll-free number, folks, and call us. 877-789-2539.
[1:50:09.000 --> 1:50:15.000]  Haven't been hearing those, though. It's so wonderful, though. Let's go ahead now and take another call.
[1:50:15.000 --> 1:50:20.000]  Let's talk to Sarah in Illinois. Thanks for holding.
[1:50:20.000 --> 1:50:27.000]  Hi, Alex. My name is Sarah. I am actually a school counselor in Illinois. I work with K-2 students.
[1:50:27.000 --> 1:50:34.000]  And one of the teachers I actually work with had to go home on Tuesday because I heard that her mom fell down the stairs.
[1:50:34.000 --> 1:50:41.000]  And I found out today that her mom fell down the stairs because she had a stroke and a heart attack.
[1:50:41.000 --> 1:50:49.000]  And now she has a traumatic brain injury. But this happened like two days after she took her second COVID vaccination.
[1:50:49.000 --> 1:50:51.000]  Wow. And how old was she?
[1:50:51.000 --> 1:50:59.000]  You know, I'm not sure how old her mom was. I'm guessing probably in her 60s, maybe early 70s. She's a little bit younger than I am, the teacher.
[1:50:59.000 --> 1:51:04.000]  I wonder how many people have got to die until folks wake up because that's what we...
[1:51:04.000 --> 1:51:10.000]  You're the caller earlier about he's got family works in nursing home and they don't believe in vaccines now because they saw, you know,
[1:51:10.000 --> 1:51:14.000]  something like a large percentage of the residents die in one week.
[1:51:14.000 --> 1:51:22.000]  I mean, I have a crew member here whose mother is a head nurse and they have over 200 people at the nursing home and a whole bunch of them die within a week.
[1:51:22.000 --> 1:51:26.000]  I mean, they watch and the rest of them wouldn't even get up and eat for like a week.
[1:51:26.000 --> 1:51:33.000]  I mean, this is devastating. Like a king cobra went through the facility biting people.
[1:51:33.000 --> 1:51:39.000]  My greatest fear is that they start giving this to children and parents just willfully take their kids to get injected with this poison.
[1:51:39.000 --> 1:51:44.000]  And I watch, like, hundreds of the children that I work with die.
[1:51:44.000 --> 1:51:47.000]  Well, kids are a lot tougher and they don't have as many plaques.
[1:51:47.000 --> 1:51:51.000]  See, the plaque in arteries is very similar, they say, to this protein.
[1:51:51.000 --> 1:51:54.000]  And as you get older, proteins form in the brain.
[1:51:54.000 --> 1:51:56.000]  But it's still going to hurt them really bad.
[1:51:56.000 --> 1:52:00.000]  What children are having, we're hearing, is convulsions.
[1:52:00.000 --> 1:52:07.000]  And that's an autoimmune response because the body is trying to fight it off.
[1:52:07.000 --> 1:52:10.000]  Well, that is, yeah, my heart is aching for the world.
[1:52:10.000 --> 1:52:15.000]  It really is like all we can do is seriously pray and like you say, like turn to Jesus.
[1:52:15.000 --> 1:52:18.000]  I mean, this is our time to strengthen our mind, bodies and spirits.
[1:52:18.000 --> 1:52:25.000]  And the fact that you talk about Jesus all the time makes me listen to you every day because I know that you are, you are walking in the truth and you are leading the way.
[1:52:25.000 --> 1:52:26.000]  So I thank you very much.
[1:52:26.000 --> 1:52:27.000]  Well, God bless you, man.
[1:52:27.000 --> 1:52:28.000]  I don't want to say something.
[1:52:28.000 --> 1:52:32.000]  I'm as wicked as the day is long growing up and I've been like to fight and I like women the whole nine yards.
[1:52:32.000 --> 1:52:37.000]  I talk about Jesus all the time because I've always loved God, but I mean, it's here, world government, Satan.
[1:52:37.000 --> 1:52:40.000]  Only reason I can be on there is, is the Holy Spirit.
[1:52:40.000 --> 1:52:41.000]  I am animated by it.
[1:52:41.000 --> 1:52:42.000]  It is taking control of me.
[1:52:42.000 --> 1:52:50.000]  I prayed to God the last six months to heal me of my, my, my issues of drinking and of getting angry.
[1:52:50.000 --> 1:52:54.000]  And it has, I've been healed of it recently and I just, it's all God.
[1:52:54.000 --> 1:52:56.000]  And I've just turned myself over to Christ.
[1:52:56.000 --> 1:52:59.000]  I have said, just please Holy Spirit, I'm too weak.
[1:52:59.000 --> 1:53:00.000]  I need you to come into me.
[1:53:00.000 --> 1:53:04.000]  And Satan will come into you without you wanting Satan.
[1:53:04.000 --> 1:53:07.000]  The spirit of the world forces itself.
[1:53:07.000 --> 1:53:10.000]  You've got to knock on the door.
[1:53:10.000 --> 1:53:18.000]  You, you know, and Christ is not going on your door, but you've got to open your heart up and you're not going to find it in these weird churches and all these things.
[1:53:18.000 --> 1:53:19.000]  These aren't churches anymore, folks.
[1:53:19.000 --> 1:53:20.000]  I have a headline.
[1:53:20.000 --> 1:53:23.000]  Pastors fight heartbeat bill in Texas.
[1:53:23.000 --> 1:53:25.000]  Pastors say it's not a baby.
[1:53:25.000 --> 1:53:26.000]  Those aren't pastors.
[1:53:26.000 --> 1:53:30.000]  Those are Satanists that went and got a seminary and got into the churches.
[1:53:30.000 --> 1:53:32.000]  They've captured everything.
[1:53:32.000 --> 1:53:38.000]  They're shutting down a church every week in, they brought me the article.
[1:53:38.000 --> 1:53:39.000]  Hit Daniels did.
[1:53:39.000 --> 1:53:46.000]  They're shutting a church telling something like every week in, in France, the Muslims are burning them down every week.
[1:53:46.000 --> 1:53:47.000]  This is the takeover.
[1:53:47.000 --> 1:53:48.000]  Okay.
[1:53:48.000 --> 1:53:50.000]  I got to seven calls.
[1:53:50.000 --> 1:53:52.000]  That's, that's not the nine I wanted, but I'm going to break.
[1:53:52.000 --> 1:53:57.000]  I'm going to come right back with callers that are patiently holding.
[1:53:57.000 --> 1:53:58.000]  So stay there.
[1:53:58.000 --> 1:54:02.000]  We will come right back to Ed and others.
[1:54:02.000 --> 1:54:06.000]  Please do not forget your prayers for this broadcaster key.
[1:54:06.000 --> 1:54:08.000]  Your financial support is wonderful.
[1:54:08.000 --> 1:54:09.000]  Productsinforwardstore.com.
[1:54:09.000 --> 1:54:15.000]  But the, just as important as spreading the word and just thank you folks for all you do.
[1:54:15.000 --> 1:54:17.000]  We have the most banned section of banned out video.
[1:54:17.000 --> 1:54:20.000]  It's all the medical doctors and scientists that have been censored.
[1:54:20.000 --> 1:54:23.000]  And it, and they're the scientists and then they're laying out the facts.
[1:54:23.000 --> 1:54:30.000]  And we've got interviews a year ago with medical doctors warning about the heart attacks and the blood plots because they know why they never could make something for the cold.
[1:54:30.000 --> 1:54:31.000]  That's what Corona is.
[1:54:31.000 --> 1:54:32.000]  It's like a super cold.
[1:54:32.000 --> 1:54:36.000]  It's very souped up because it attacks your own body.
[1:54:36.000 --> 1:54:37.000]  I mean, it's incredible.
[1:54:37.000 --> 1:54:38.000]  And now it's happening.
[1:54:38.000 --> 1:54:39.000]  And they knew what they were doing.
[1:54:39.000 --> 1:54:43.000]  This is incredible.
[1:54:43.000 --> 1:54:50.000]  Serving with info wars is a great honor, but I still need my morning coffee.

[1:55:16.000 --> 1:55:20.000]  There has never been a more important time to support info wars.

[1:55:44.000 --> 1:55:48.000]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[1:55:48.000 --> 1:55:52.000]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[1:55:52.000 --> 1:56:01.000]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from info wars store dot com.
[1:56:01.000 --> 1:56:18.000]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses and joints and the digestive system.
[1:56:18.000 --> 1:56:29.000]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[1:56:29.000 --> 1:56:38.000]  It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality.
[1:56:38.000 --> 1:56:47.000]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member or yourself at info wars store dot com.
[1:56:47.000 --> 1:56:54.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:56:54.000 --> 1:57:20.000]  Music playing
[1:57:20.000 --> 1:57:28.000]  Music playing
[1:57:28.000 --> 1:57:32.000]  Imagine
[1:57:32.000 --> 1:57:53.000]  Before a year ago, if you were taking your child to preschool daycare, they said, oh, sorry, you can't come in the building. You'd say this place must be criminal. They must be dirty. They must be hurting the kids. They must be beating them or worse.
[1:57:53.000 --> 1:58:02.000]  I'm sorry, all written up by the UN, all written up by the globalists as an excuse for institutions to kill our old people.
[1:58:02.000 --> 1:58:09.000]  And oh, CVS and Walgreens and Walmart won't ever show anybody the vaccines and it's a control rollout.
[1:58:09.000 --> 1:58:15.000]  So no one else is allowed to buy a vial of it and have it tested. After all, it's secret and Bill Gates will sue you.
[1:58:15.000 --> 1:58:26.000]  And if you try to get it and test it, that's patented secret and no one can know. Oh, and the insert says no testing. It's all blank.
[1:58:26.000 --> 1:58:30.000]  It's the perfect way to carry the shot. It's what you do.
[1:58:30.000 --> 1:58:41.000]  If you were going to kill people and you you hit them with something that affects everybody different where your body produces a protein recognizes it as an enemy and then starts attacking itself.
[1:58:41.000 --> 1:58:48.000]  And it's all hiding in plain view with the censorship to silence the good doctors and people that expose it.
[1:58:48.000 --> 1:59:02.000]  And with the tyranny and with the fear with the lying about the dead numbers to scare you, the censorship, the fear, the lies and then the cover up of the death and the disease and they make all the money off those that survive with linger.
[1:59:02.000 --> 1:59:05.000]  How evil, how sick, how diabolical.
[1:59:05.000 --> 1:59:11.000]  Charlene and then James and Ed, Charlene, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[1:59:11.000 --> 1:59:19.000]  I have three points. My brother went and got the vaccine and his arm had it for a week.
[1:59:19.000 --> 1:59:28.000]  And the second point is why can't these people who have lost loved ones start to sue the doctors, the media and the nurses who are injecting them.
[1:59:28.000 --> 1:59:35.000]  Well, we have a lawyer actually joining us next segment Robert Barnes, my exact subject because just because they have the 1986 vaccine damage fund.
[1:59:35.000 --> 1:59:39.000]  This isn't even a vaccine. This didn't go through the regular trials. The law has been violated.
[1:59:39.000 --> 1:59:45.000]  And yeah, I think the doctors and nurses, all of them should be sued regardless just as nuisance suits.
[1:59:45.000 --> 1:59:49.000]  Even if they later the courts throw it out to show them they're going to be held accountable.
[1:59:49.000 --> 1:59:54.000]  And anybody ever forces this on my family and they get hurt. You've assaulted my family with a deadly weapon.
[1:59:54.000 --> 1:59:59.000]  And so you've assaulted me. I have a right to defend myself. That's where this is all going.
[1:59:59.000 --> 2:00:02.000]  And by the way, you're a nurse. What's your view on this?
[2:00:02.000 --> 2:00:04.000]  Me? Yes.
[2:00:04.000 --> 2:00:11.000]  Well, they all need to be sued on it because Canada is going through with the Nuremberg trial on their doctors.
[2:00:11.000 --> 2:00:15.000]  And they're suing to go and Pope Francis and the Queen.
[2:00:15.000 --> 2:00:20.000]  No, you're absolutely right. A lot of people are suing over the Nuremberg code. You are damn right.
[2:00:20.000 --> 2:00:25.000]  Thank you, Charlene. All right, let's talk to Ed in Ohio. Go ahead, Ed.
[2:00:25.000 --> 2:00:31.000]  Hey, Alex. Before anything else, I'd like to pray with you. Is that okay?
[2:00:31.000 --> 2:00:34.000]  We got about a minute and a half. Go ahead, brother.
[2:00:34.000 --> 2:00:44.000]  Copy that. Father in heaven, please let the flames of truth coming from this man's mouth burn away the evil that is it.
[2:00:44.000 --> 2:00:52.000]  Shrouding the minds of our fellow citizens and other people of the world. We ask this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:00:52.000 --> 2:00:55.000]  Amen. All right, Alex.
[2:00:55.000 --> 2:01:01.000]  My grandmother just took the shot against my advisement.
[2:01:01.000 --> 2:01:11.000]  And now her Billy Rubin count has gone completely off the charts and her and my grandfather both no longer have any energy.
[2:01:11.000 --> 2:01:26.000]  And these are two older folks who have been tending their own grapefruit trees and gardening every single day since they retired in the early 90s.
[2:01:26.000 --> 2:01:31.000]  You know, stay there. I've got Robert Barnes coming on, but I want you to be able to tell him the story of this.
[2:01:31.000 --> 2:01:35.000]  And that's what they said immediately started happening. People are totally exhausted.
[2:01:35.000 --> 2:01:39.000]  That's what people that work at nursing homes, I now say, and a bunch of them die.
[2:01:39.000 --> 2:01:45.000]  And so this is just a massive crowd against humanity, but people love to be virtue signaling.
[2:01:45.000 --> 2:01:52.000]  So they're marching into these death camps willfully.
[2:01:52.000 --> 2:02:01.000]  Listeners have rightfully been complaining the last six months or so saying, where are most of the best selling products you have that we love?
[2:02:01.000 --> 2:02:04.000]  And my answer is the supply chain has broken down.
[2:02:04.000 --> 2:02:10.000]  I have to either reformulate or I have to lower the quality to get a lot of these. And so that's why we don't have a lot of products in.
[2:02:10.000 --> 2:02:14.000]  That's why in fours, it's in financial trouble is because if we had the product, you would be buying it.
[2:02:14.000 --> 2:02:17.000]  We have the money, but so many of them have been sold out.
[2:02:17.000 --> 2:02:23.000]  Just like you noticed, a lot of other items at the store aren't available because civilization is being artificially imploded.
[2:02:23.000 --> 2:02:30.000]  But finally, X2 is back in stock, the good halogen, deep earth crystal iodide so essential in your body.
[2:02:30.000 --> 2:02:35.000]  It's really the missing link. It's 50% off. We've got a big shipment of it at infowarstore.com.
[2:02:35.000 --> 2:02:40.000]  Now when it gets ready to sell out, we'll have to go back to near full price, take advantage of this now, stock up.
[2:02:40.000 --> 2:02:45.000]  And don't forget to take your X2 because I have a tendency to forget how great it is and not take it myself.
[2:02:45.000 --> 2:02:49.000]  But when I do stamina, libido, energy, weight loss, it's incredible.
[2:02:49.000 --> 2:03:01.000]  It's essential. It's X2 at infowarstore.com.
[2:03:01.000 --> 2:03:08.000]  Well, I saw he wrote a big piece that got picked up by low newspapers and publications about the dangers of the COVID-19 vaccines
[2:03:08.000 --> 2:03:14.000]  and how they're really crossing the Rubicon and how the answer to 1984 is 1776.
[2:03:14.000 --> 2:03:21.000]  Which could friend of mine, great historian, not just a famous lawyer, is Robert Barnes and he joins us the rest of the hour.
[2:03:21.000 --> 2:03:27.000]  I'm hosting the fourth hour. I'll continue with your calls. We're going to get to some of the calls with Barnes as well this hour.
[2:03:27.000 --> 2:03:35.000]  Jenny and Brian and James and Ed and Brian and Jeff, your calls are all coming up.
[2:03:35.000 --> 2:03:40.000]  We don't screen the calls. Just have a good phone line. Nobody calls in saying I love the vaccine or nothing bad happened.
[2:03:40.000 --> 2:03:47.000]  They call them saying the whole nursing home, 10% of them died in the nursing home and nobody else would get out of their bed.
[2:03:47.000 --> 2:03:52.000]  My grandma died, my grandpa died. I'm a nurse who will come in paralyzed from the vaccine.
[2:03:52.000 --> 2:03:58.000]  I mean, this is not a vaccine and already with the adverse reaction reporting system is off the charts.
[2:03:58.000 --> 2:04:05.000]  And so Robert Barnes has been talking a lot about this since a year ago that these mRNAs are not vaccines.
[2:04:05.000 --> 2:04:10.000]  How the virus vector system is not a classical vaccine. They don't give you an attenuated virus.
[2:04:10.000 --> 2:04:13.000]  If you learn how to beat it, chill out side effects, but it does work.
[2:04:13.000 --> 2:04:21.000]  They fire a live virus inside a virus into your cells and reprogram them or they program the ribosomes to go in and reprogram your body.
[2:04:21.000 --> 2:04:31.000]  And Barnes, this is smoking gun. Immunization with SARS, coronavirus vaccine leads to pulmonary autoimmune responses
[2:04:31.000 --> 2:04:39.000]  or immunopathology of the rats and mice challenged with the SARS virus, the coronavirus SARS virus.
[2:04:39.000 --> 2:04:47.000]  They did a bunch of different coronaviruses, same family, and they did three different vaccines and it basically caused holes to be eaten in the lungs,
[2:04:47.000 --> 2:04:52.000]  blood clots and death in a large portion of them. There's a bunch of other studies showing the same thing,
[2:04:52.000 --> 2:04:58.000]  but this is prestigious level four lab that studies bio weapons, you name it.
[2:04:58.000 --> 2:05:05.000]  This is huge from nine years ago, and now the death numbers are just exploding.
[2:05:05.000 --> 2:05:17.000]  And now I showed video earlier where a pharmacist opens up the J and J virus vector Franken shot and it's all clean except for QR code, the lot number.
[2:05:17.000 --> 2:05:21.000]  Not what's in it, not who made it, not the side effects because no studies were done.
[2:05:21.000 --> 2:05:25.000]  But then John Oliver and all the other programs says, oh, it's all tested, it's all safe.
[2:05:25.000 --> 2:05:29.000]  Don't listen to Tucker Carlson. Don't listen to Joe Rogan. Don't listen to Alice Jones.
[2:05:29.000 --> 2:05:36.000]  Well, I know you've been studying this deeply. I know you're preparing legal actions on this that you may be able to break today.
[2:05:36.000 --> 2:05:44.000]  But my God, how do we respond to this giant revolution, this assault where no one will be able to know what happened because no test was done.
[2:05:44.000 --> 2:05:48.000]  They lie and say studies were done. Now they're going after the children.
[2:05:48.000 --> 2:05:55.000]  Robert Barnes of their emergency injunctions, like Dr. Wolfgang Wudarg tried along with the former chief scientist at Pfizer.
[2:05:55.000 --> 2:06:02.000]  Dr. Yedon last year. What do we do because everything they warned of in their emergency injunction has now come through.
[2:06:02.000 --> 2:06:08.000]  Yes, I mean, there's several medical problems with the vaccines in a wide range of contexts.
[2:06:08.000 --> 2:06:17.000]  And we've been talking about him for over a year and said that a lot of the hype about the pandemic seem to be driven to get people to be desperate for vaccines as the solution.
[2:06:17.000 --> 2:06:22.000]  Goes back to event 201 and the Gates Foundation and what China was really up to.
[2:06:22.000 --> 2:06:34.000]  But on top of all that, from a purely legal perspective, and of course, you had this swine flu debacle vaccine of 1976, where even CBS admitted it was a disaster back when you could still sue over vaccines more easily.
[2:06:34.000 --> 2:06:43.000]  The CDC has a giant site with all OK. We gave people cancer viruses with this. We sterilize people with that. I mean, it's a fact.
[2:06:43.000 --> 2:06:53.000]  Yes, and there is no history of successful coronavirus vaccines. So I mean, there's just a long that we've problem after problem after problem, red flag after red flag after red flag.
[2:06:53.000 --> 2:07:06.000]  And from a legal perspective, what's kind of unique here is twofold. One is this is the first attempt to start mandating a drug against informed consent since the Nuremberg Code went into effect in 1947.
[2:07:06.000 --> 2:07:21.000]  All of the other illicit governmental experimentation on people has mostly been done in secret or by subterfuge. Here we're having overt attempts to force people to take something and put it in their body without them being first informed of what the risk is in a meaningful way,
[2:07:21.000 --> 2:07:30.000]  and second without them consenting to it by coercing it as a condition of travel, coercing it as a condition of employment, coercing it as a condition of education.
[2:07:30.000 --> 2:07:41.000]  And the core problem with that, aside from the constitutional problem and the problem from the Nuremberg Code, and people may not know the Nuremberg Code not only put in the informed consent principle as a matter of medical ethics,
[2:07:41.000 --> 2:07:49.000]  the United States courts have recognized that the Nuremberg Code is enforceable against governments and other actors.
[2:07:49.000 --> 2:08:04.000]  Now, on top of that, the emergency use authorization, and the media has kind of suppressed information about this, then these particular vaccines have not met the requisite medical level of approval to be considered regular pharmaceutical drugs.
[2:08:04.000 --> 2:08:12.000]  Instead, they were only given emergency use authorization, EUA authorization under a specific statute.
[2:08:12.000 --> 2:08:19.000]  That specific statute states that you cannot mandate it and no one else can mandate it.
[2:08:19.000 --> 2:08:32.000]  And the reason for it is the concerns that the risk may be too high, because how can you have informed consent about a drug that has not even met the requisite level of medical testing to be regularly approved?
[2:08:32.000 --> 2:08:35.000]  You can't because they don't know what all the risks are.
[2:08:35.000 --> 2:08:41.000]  We're basically living guinea pigs. People taking these vaccines are living human government-
[2:08:41.000 --> 2:08:44.000]  I wonder what big pharma and the UN and Gates are counting on is.
[2:08:44.000 --> 2:08:47.000]  They put this out there. They got governments to sign on.
[2:08:47.000 --> 2:08:50.000]  So now, in a way, we're all guilty for letting it happen.
[2:08:50.000 --> 2:08:55.000]  They think now, societally, we'll all defend ourselves because they got us to sign on to a fraud.
[2:08:55.000 --> 2:09:01.000]  And so we'll continue to basically sign on to the Nigerian email scam even after you've been ripped off once.
[2:09:01.000 --> 2:09:05.000]  You don't want to admit you've been ripped off. How do you counter psychology like that?
[2:09:05.000 --> 2:09:14.000]  Well, I think one way to counter it is just to look at the information that you were one of the very first people to report that now even mainstream media is finally coming around to.
[2:09:14.000 --> 2:09:20.000]  But for most of the last year, they called it conspiracy theory, which is COVID-19 is not a natural occurring virus.
[2:09:20.000 --> 2:09:29.000]  COVID-19 is a man-made disease almost guaranteed to have come from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, partially funded by people like Bill Gates,
[2:09:29.000 --> 2:09:37.000]  partially funded by people like Fauci, misusing misappropriating governmental monies in part for it for their BSL level four research.
[2:09:37.000 --> 2:09:49.000]  And just look at that as an example. That was an example where they attempted and they were convinced that they could basically bamboozle the American public into believing this was just a back driven virus
[2:09:49.000 --> 2:09:58.000]  and somebody decided to have some bad back to and that somehow magically led to an unusually infectious virus that spread as rapidly as this one did.
[2:09:58.000 --> 2:10:05.000]  The major virology institutes with CRISPR editors all over the world, the discoverer of HIV saying it's a man made.
[2:10:05.000 --> 2:10:12.000]  They took a cold virus, put an HIV delivery system on it. It's not HIV, but has the same spreadability through the mucous membrane.
[2:10:12.000 --> 2:10:16.000]  But here's the deal. Even if they have a vaccine liability protection, this isn't a vaccine.
[2:10:16.000 --> 2:10:25.000]  But what about the fact they violated form consent violates Nuremberg code, but also the fact Fauci and Gates can be sued for funding the Wuhan lab.
[2:10:25.000 --> 2:10:30.000]  There's a trillion ways to cut these guys up and people need to start following the suits, don't they?
[2:10:30.000 --> 2:10:37.000]  Yes, no doubt. In my view, it violates the Emergency Use Authorization Act, which says you cannot compel or coerce it.
[2:10:37.000 --> 2:10:43.000]  So anybody that's compelling or coercing it is violating the very terms and conditions upon which this drug is even allowed to be distributed.
[2:10:43.000 --> 2:10:48.000]  The whole point is that this drug can only be distributed if there's complete informed consent.
[2:10:48.000 --> 2:10:53.000]  It cannot even be legally distributed if there's not informed consent. You cannot coerce it.
[2:10:53.000 --> 2:10:57.000]  So anybody coercing it is violating the law by which this drug was even distributed.
[2:10:57.000 --> 2:11:00.000]  So again, you're right. You're a lawyer. It's on record.
[2:11:00.000 --> 2:11:05.000]  The inserts on these vaccines that aren't vaccines are blank, which again violates federal law.
[2:11:05.000 --> 2:11:08.000]  I mean, why was Gates and them crazy enough to do this?
[2:11:08.000 --> 2:11:15.000]  I think it's because he got busted with Epstein and they panicked as a diversion and they had this plan operation lockstep on the shelf.
[2:11:15.000 --> 2:11:21.000]  In fact, I know that's what happened. His wife's now confirmed she's pissed that he was having sex with kids, probably.
[2:11:21.000 --> 2:11:25.000]  But if you look at Bill Gates, Bill Gates has a long history of this being his agenda.
[2:11:25.000 --> 2:11:28.000]  I mean, really, it was his family agenda going back more than a half century,
[2:11:28.000 --> 2:11:35.000]  which he believes that getting popular acceptance of vaccines for more populations on a broader scale,
[2:11:35.000 --> 2:11:38.000]  because this is unusual in having a vaccine for adults.
[2:11:38.000 --> 2:11:42.000]  And not only a vaccine for adults, apparently a vaccine you have to take two shots for,
[2:11:42.000 --> 2:11:45.000]  maybe three shots for, maybe a shot every six months for,
[2:11:45.000 --> 2:11:48.000]  maybe a shot you have to take the rest of your life that doesn't end with this shot.
[2:11:48.000 --> 2:11:53.000]  That's been Bill Gates express explicit agenda, because he believes that mass,
[2:11:53.000 --> 2:11:56.000]  somehow max vaccines are going to mass reduce the population.
[2:11:56.000 --> 2:11:59.000]  He explains his explanation for this, but does anybody really buy that?
[2:11:59.000 --> 2:12:03.000]  I believe that we're going to get rid of people with this. So take it.
[2:12:03.000 --> 2:12:08.000]  He's really telling you, like McCount Dracula goes by and says, can I come to dinner? Let me in.
[2:12:08.000 --> 2:12:13.000]  You have to metaphysics. He has to tell you I'm here for dinner, except you're the dinner.
[2:12:13.000 --> 2:12:17.000]  That's exactly right. And Bill Gates has been pretty overt about a lot of this stuff.
[2:12:17.000 --> 2:12:21.000]  I mean, not only that, look at how well this manmade virus managed to
[2:12:21.000 --> 2:12:24.000]  magically mirror a Bill Gates dream pandemic.
[2:12:24.000 --> 2:12:28.000]  It has de facto death panels, racially discriminatory in effect,
[2:12:28.000 --> 2:12:30.000]  politically helps his causes.
[2:12:30.000 --> 2:12:33.000]  Mighty interesting how this all tend to work together.
[2:12:33.000 --> 2:12:36.000]  Right out on time to embarrass Donald Trump and the rest of it.
[2:12:36.000 --> 2:12:40.000]  Couldn't have precisely couldn't have scripted it better.
[2:12:40.000 --> 2:12:43.000]  Robert Barnes, great historian, great lawyer.
[2:12:43.000 --> 2:12:47.000]  We'll be right back with him with more than your phone calls. We're also going to get into
[2:12:47.000 --> 2:13:15.000]  the Chauvin trial, the federal indictments.
[2:13:15.000 --> 2:13:18.000]  We're selling online for as much as $300 a copy.
[2:13:18.000 --> 2:13:22.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, I have mass produced it again in the highest quality HD.
[2:13:22.000 --> 2:13:27.000]  It is available after not being available for years at infowarstore.com.
[2:13:27.000 --> 2:13:30.000]  We're selling it for $14.95 for one copy as low as $3.95.
[2:13:30.000 --> 2:13:32.000]  When you buy them in bulk, you're showing your friends and family.
[2:13:32.000 --> 2:13:38.000]  And every DVD has a zero country code, meaning you can burn copies of it anywhere in the world.
[2:13:38.000 --> 2:13:41.000]  I'm asking you to. I'm begging you to.
[2:13:41.000 --> 2:13:46.000]  Predict the great reset, the new owner takeover, the fake virus and so much more.
[2:13:46.000 --> 2:13:52.000]  That's why the film is evergreen and more explosive than ever. Get it today at infowarstore.com.
[2:13:52.000 --> 2:13:55.000]  The best product. I'm not supposed to be biased, but I'm going to tell you all now.
[2:13:55.000 --> 2:13:57.000]  If you haven't tried TurboForce, you need to try it.
[2:13:57.000 --> 2:14:00.000]  I've tried TurboForce with everything.
[2:14:00.000 --> 2:14:03.000]  Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy. I put TurboForce in my coffee.
[2:14:03.000 --> 2:14:07.000]  That was a crazy week. I don't remember sleeping, but as far as the products go,
[2:14:07.000 --> 2:14:12.000]  it was my favorite and all the info wars products were down to taking control of your life, taking control of your health,
[2:14:12.000 --> 2:14:15.000]  not relying on other people to do it for you.
[2:14:15.000 --> 2:14:21.000]  Nobody wakes up in the morning and thinks, I'm going to give that person over there a better life.
[2:14:21.000 --> 2:14:27.000]  I'm going to wake up today. You know what? I'm going to spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier, happier and richer.
[2:14:27.000 --> 2:14:29.000]  I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend.
[2:14:29.000 --> 2:14:31.000]  I don't think that happens very often. It's never happened to me.
[2:14:31.000 --> 2:14:34.000]  I've never had anyone knock on my door and said, Tate, you're such a good guy.
[2:14:34.000 --> 2:14:38.000]  How can I improve your life in every single way? There's only one person who woke up and fought that, and that was me.
[2:14:38.000 --> 2:14:41.000]  I woke up and fought. You know what? Okay, I want to take control of my life.
[2:14:41.000 --> 2:14:44.000]  I want to take control of my health, and that's why you need to go to infowars.com.
[2:14:44.000 --> 2:14:46.000]  Take control of your health right now and support the resistance.
[2:14:46.000 --> 2:14:49.000]  Don't buy into the group thing. Don't drink the Kool-Aid. Drink the TurboForce.
[2:14:49.000 --> 2:15:04.000]  Kool-Aid's bad and the TurboForce is good.
[2:15:19.000 --> 2:15:29.000]  You know, I was born in the country I was born into, and I'm glad to be an American in Texas.
[2:15:29.000 --> 2:15:33.000]  But I did grow up and had family that told me that the government was evil and bad and corrupt,
[2:15:33.000 --> 2:15:38.000]  and had some really evil elements in it because they were there. They saw it happen.
[2:15:38.000 --> 2:15:42.000]  And then the Internet goes, oh, look, Jones admits he's involved with the CIA or something.
[2:15:42.000 --> 2:15:48.000]  No, no, no, that's my family saying the government was corrupt because they were involved in corrupt areas of it.
[2:15:48.000 --> 2:15:51.000]  That doesn't mean I'm part of it. You judge it free by its fruits.
[2:15:51.000 --> 2:15:55.000]  We're here exposing this because it's in the historical record.
[2:15:55.000 --> 2:15:59.000]  That's where you really learn what's happening. This stuff's really not hidden.
[2:15:59.000 --> 2:16:02.000]  Bill Gates and others, as Robert Barnes' constitutional lawyer just mentioned,
[2:16:02.000 --> 2:16:07.000]  bragged about this is the blueprint for power and a takeover, how they use a virus to bring in world government,
[2:16:07.000 --> 2:16:13.000]  how they censor their opposition and create a panic and have unlimited shots
[2:16:13.000 --> 2:16:18.000]  and take control of human evolution.
[2:16:18.000 --> 2:16:21.000]  And now it's here.
[2:16:21.000 --> 2:16:26.000]  Robert Barnes is about to give you exclusive breaking information.
[2:16:26.000 --> 2:16:31.000]  Here is the exclusive breaking information as humanity fights back.
[2:16:31.000 --> 2:16:33.000]  Robert Barnes.
[2:16:33.000 --> 2:16:38.000]  Yes, we're going to be filing suit over the next two weeks across the country against three groups,
[2:16:38.000 --> 2:16:46.000]  governments, employers and educational institutions that are attempting to force or coerce people to have the vaccine
[2:16:46.000 --> 2:16:49.000]  because it violates basic core rights under the statute.
[2:16:49.000 --> 2:16:54.000]  The emergency use authorization law does not authorize this to be coerced on anybody.
[2:16:54.000 --> 2:16:59.000]  It requires as a precondition of its availability.
[2:16:59.000 --> 2:17:06.000]  The informed consent principles also reflected in secondly, the Nuremberg Code put in place in 1947.
[2:17:06.000 --> 2:17:09.000]  So we would not treat human beings as guinea pigs anymore.
[2:17:09.000 --> 2:17:16.000]  There would be no more state experimentation or doctor experimentation on human beings without their informed consent.
[2:17:16.000 --> 2:17:23.000]  And third, it violates core constitutional rights, that the old Jacobson decision was a limited decision
[2:17:23.000 --> 2:17:30.000]  with a limited context that the Supreme Court increasingly recognizes has no valid legitimacy today.
[2:17:30.000 --> 2:17:34.000]  I have long been waiting for a time to challenge the foundation of that decision
[2:17:34.000 --> 2:17:41.000]  because it was the foundation of the trilogy of infamy that led to the Korematsu and Connie Buck decisions
[2:17:41.000 --> 2:17:45.000]  that allowed forced sterilizations and forced detention camps in America.
[2:17:45.000 --> 2:17:50.000]  They are decisions that should live in infamy and should be condemned and damned appropriately.
[2:17:50.000 --> 2:17:55.000]  And I wish to use these cases to challenge the Jacobson premise across the entire board
[2:17:55.000 --> 2:17:58.000]  and to bury that trilogy of infamy once and for all.
[2:17:58.000 --> 2:18:04.000]  So working with Bobby Kennedy and others on all of the legal issues related to these cases and the constitutional issues,
[2:18:04.000 --> 2:18:07.000]  we will have the suits filed within the next two weeks.
[2:18:07.000 --> 2:18:10.000]  And we're actually talking to a range of potential plaintiffs.
[2:18:10.000 --> 2:18:15.000]  There are people who have already been fired because they refuse to take the vaccine.
[2:18:15.000 --> 2:18:19.000]  People at risk of right now being fired because they don't take the vaccine.
[2:18:19.000 --> 2:18:22.000]  Not only that, there's going to be a fourth component in some of these cases
[2:18:22.000 --> 2:18:26.000]  because it appears employers are violating certain HIPAA principles
[2:18:26.000 --> 2:18:29.000]  by demanding people sacrifice their medical privacy
[2:18:29.000 --> 2:18:34.000]  or disclosing records concerning their medical privacy to third parties without authorization under the law.
[2:18:34.000 --> 2:18:37.000]  So the goal is because a lot of contract tracking and tracing
[2:18:37.000 --> 2:18:40.000]  basically involved an invasion of HIPAA protected rights
[2:18:40.000 --> 2:18:46.000]  that employers could not involuntarily against the lack of informed consent conduct and engage it.
[2:18:46.000 --> 2:18:49.000]  So the goal is to bring back the rights to medical privacy,
[2:18:49.000 --> 2:18:54.000]  bring back the informed consent movement that the Nuremberg Code established for the world to follow
[2:18:54.000 --> 2:18:57.000]  and make it the law of the land in the United States
[2:18:57.000 --> 2:19:01.000]  as frankly the statutes in our Constitution already say that it is
[2:19:01.000 --> 2:19:03.000]  and existing case law already says that it is.
[2:19:03.000 --> 2:19:07.000]  We're going to be careful and selective where we bring the suit, how we bring the suit
[2:19:07.000 --> 2:19:09.000]  to give us the best chance of success.
[2:19:09.000 --> 2:19:11.000]  We may run into obstacles or hurdles early,
[2:19:11.000 --> 2:19:14.000]  but ultimately I believe we will be able to establish
[2:19:14.000 --> 2:19:16.000]  that people have a right of medical privacy
[2:19:16.000 --> 2:19:18.000]  and cannot have something forced into their body
[2:19:18.000 --> 2:19:21.000]  against their informed consent and violation of the Nuremberg Code.
[2:19:21.000 --> 2:19:26.000]  Especially these vaccines which are uniquely unproven to be safe and effective.
[2:19:26.000 --> 2:19:31.000]  Robert, let's talk about the motive of Bill Gates, the UN, the globalist,
[2:19:31.000 --> 2:19:33.000]  the Wuhan lab, the prescripting.
[2:19:33.000 --> 2:19:38.000]  Now even the former head of the CDC Redfield says clearly it's a man made out of a lab.
[2:19:38.000 --> 2:19:41.000]  The discoverer of HIV, the Australian government, the Indian government
[2:19:41.000 --> 2:19:43.000]  has a $2 billion CRISPR machine.
[2:19:43.000 --> 2:19:46.000]  They scanned it, they said you can see the P Shuttle genes
[2:19:46.000 --> 2:19:49.000]  where they gene-gunned it and fired viruses together.
[2:19:49.000 --> 2:19:51.000]  This is done, you know, at the microscopic level
[2:19:51.000 --> 2:19:55.000]  and they do it millions of times so they finally get one that's like they want.
[2:19:55.000 --> 2:19:58.000]  Then they breed that in pigs, then those pigs die,
[2:19:58.000 --> 2:20:01.000]  they then feed it to more piglets and then take the blood out
[2:20:01.000 --> 2:20:04.000]  and then use an electron microscope to funnel out all the viruses.
[2:20:04.000 --> 2:20:07.000]  So that's how this, there's a lot of ways to do it, I've read about it,
[2:20:07.000 --> 2:20:11.000]  but one way the Chinese were doing it at Wuhan was again,
[2:20:11.000 --> 2:20:14.000]  use a bunch of gene-guns, firing a bunch of viruses together
[2:20:14.000 --> 2:20:16.000]  until you finally go through an electron microscope
[2:20:16.000 --> 2:20:20.000]  and find one that got the viruses together like you wanted, all meshed together.
[2:20:20.000 --> 2:20:24.000]  Then you replicate that in a pig, the pig dies of the virus,
[2:20:24.000 --> 2:20:28.000]  so you know it's deadly, you grind it up raw, feed it to piglets,
[2:20:28.000 --> 2:20:31.000]  those that die again you do it, then you extract the blood,
[2:20:31.000 --> 2:20:35.000]  then you take out the viruses you want, now you've got a growth of viruses
[2:20:35.000 --> 2:20:39.000]  and you keep growing them and then you release it into the human population
[2:20:39.000 --> 2:20:43.000]  where it starts replicating and then you have the answer to the disease you created.
[2:20:43.000 --> 2:20:47.000]  This just accidentally at the time it came out when Trump was defeating China
[2:20:47.000 --> 2:20:50.000]  and the world was waking up and nationalism and free market was exploding
[2:20:50.000 --> 2:20:54.000]  and we were going back to who we were like 1955 on steroids,
[2:20:54.000 --> 2:20:58.000]  but for everybody they had to counter it and this was the globalist counter-offensive
[2:20:58.000 --> 2:21:04.000]  and they admit they had plans like this on the shelf before, so my God, it's so obvious.
[2:21:04.000 --> 2:21:09.000]  Well exactly, it's a lack of historical understanding by a large range of the public
[2:21:09.000 --> 2:21:14.000]  that you understand, I mean if you read books like Guns, Germs and Steel or other things like it,
[2:21:14.000 --> 2:21:17.000]  germs have changed the world more than anything,
[2:21:17.000 --> 2:21:22.000]  so the desire to weaponize those germs to be selectively effective against your opponent
[2:21:22.000 --> 2:21:26.000]  has been something that they've been obsessed with throughout the 1900s
[2:21:26.000 --> 2:21:30.000]  and they just were kind of secretive about it, pretending it was bio-safety.
[2:21:30.000 --> 2:21:34.000]  You've had Francis Boyle on who's been talking about this for more than three decades,
[2:21:34.000 --> 2:21:38.000]  the great risk this posed and it just is it, could it be a coincidence
[2:21:38.000 --> 2:21:42.000]  that one of the world's most dangerous bio-safety labs experimenting in coronaviruses
[2:21:42.000 --> 2:21:46.000]  happens to be the location of the source for this virus
[2:21:46.000 --> 2:21:49.000]  and then not only that, you go to the second capacity,
[2:21:49.000 --> 2:21:54.000]  then how is it that China created this pandemic effect, this lockdown policies
[2:21:54.000 --> 2:21:58.000]  by showing how scary and dangerous and terrifying and frightening it was
[2:21:58.000 --> 2:22:03.000]  and so the whole, and saying the only way you could deal with it was the lockdowns.
[2:22:03.000 --> 2:22:07.000]  They get the technocracy, they get the surveillance grid, they get the medical tyranny,
[2:22:07.000 --> 2:22:11.000]  they get us divided, they get us spying on each other, they get trillions of dollars,
[2:22:11.000 --> 2:22:16.000]  they get UN empowerment, they get corporate liability control, they get everything.
[2:22:16.000 --> 2:22:22.000]  Exactly, and is it a coincidence that about a month later China really doesn't end up having lots of deaths?
[2:22:22.000 --> 2:22:25.000]  Like originally the assumption was China was just lying about the deaths,
[2:22:25.000 --> 2:22:29.000]  but what if instead China would just did that whole thing for theater?
[2:22:29.000 --> 2:22:32.000]  And let's just say most of it was fake, it turned out people falling down dying,
[2:22:32.000 --> 2:22:36.000]  but it gets worse. Now China refuses to take the mRNA vaccines,
[2:22:36.000 --> 2:22:40.000]  so does India and the rest of the world's banning it, and then we're the only ones basically getting it.
[2:22:40.000 --> 2:22:45.000]  I mean this is incredible. They're telling us we've got to take this, but nobody else will?
[2:22:45.000 --> 2:22:49.000]  Yeah, it tells you a lot about what China thinks about Bill Gates' vaccines
[2:22:49.000 --> 2:22:52.000]  that nobody in China will take any of Bill Gates' vaccine.
[2:22:52.000 --> 2:22:56.000]  So it tells you what their real objective is, the objective was to control the West,
[2:22:56.000 --> 2:23:01.000]  and it worked. You look at me, who came out the best economically? China.
[2:23:01.000 --> 2:23:03.000]  Who came out the best politically? China.
[2:23:03.000 --> 2:23:06.000]  The social credit system is now being exported across the Western world.
[2:23:06.000 --> 2:23:10.000]  And it gets worse. I'm sure you saw this. China announced yesterday, the Communist Party,
[2:23:10.000 --> 2:23:14.000]  you don't need to take it. We're not going to make anybody take it. No pressure there.
[2:23:14.000 --> 2:23:18.000]  You're not going to have a social credit score problem there, but here you will.
[2:23:18.000 --> 2:23:21.000]  Precisely. It's a giveaway. It's out in the open. It was the biggest scam.
[2:23:21.000 --> 2:23:27.000]  And the biggest, the biggest head, the biggest success they had was they got rid of Donald Trump,
[2:23:27.000 --> 2:23:33.000]  Bill Gates' main adversary in this context, China's main adversary to their goals and objectives.
[2:23:33.000 --> 2:23:38.000]  So can it really be such a big coincidence that China may have done all of this deliberately?
[2:23:38.000 --> 2:23:41.000]  Oh, they did a hundred percent. It's always clear to the nose on our faces.
[2:23:41.000 --> 2:23:45.000]  We'll be right back in a few minutes. Robert Barnes with a bunch of other breaking news, your phone calls.
[2:23:45.000 --> 2:23:57.000]  I'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off the successes and full-worses
[2:23:57.000 --> 2:24:03.000]  that if you're paying attention, you know we've done together. But I'll tell you this.
[2:24:03.000 --> 2:24:11.000]  The technocrats are really upping their game and they are trying to destroy all independent forms of media.
[2:24:11.000 --> 2:24:17.000]  They're trying to shutter and silence the human resistance. So now is the time to understand that
[2:24:17.000 --> 2:24:22.000]  everything we've talked about has been proven accurate. Everything you warned your friends and family about is around to be true.
[2:24:22.000 --> 2:24:29.000]  So it's now that your credibility is way up. The power structures are to silence those of us that they can't.
[2:24:29.000 --> 2:24:36.000]  But it's up to all of us to not let them silence any of us. We have the power.
[2:24:36.000 --> 2:24:43.000]  But the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech. We have to make sure that we find hard right now
[2:24:43.000 --> 2:24:48.000]  to make sure that a long, dark night doesn't come. So be the polar bears you are.
[2:24:51.000 --> 2:25:00.000]  Your brain, your heart, your bones, your liver, your eyes, everything has a better shot at surviving
[2:25:00.000 --> 2:25:04.000]  in this crazy environment when you have high quality fish oil. We've got the best out there.
[2:25:04.000 --> 2:25:09.000]  We have the highest grade of fish oil available. And what it does for your body is simply amazing.
[2:25:09.000 --> 2:25:13.000]  Everybody already knows what high quality fish oil does. And it costs us even more to put it through a process
[2:25:13.000 --> 2:25:17.000]  to remove any trace mercury that's in it. So this is also clean fish oil.
[2:25:17.000 --> 2:25:22.000]  It's been sold out for months, but it's back in stock 50% off. Grill Oil is set to sell out.
[2:25:22.000 --> 2:25:29.000]  It's amazing as well. It's at 25% off. But when you get them both together in a combo, it's 50% off as well.
[2:25:29.000 --> 2:25:35.000]  Ultimate Fish Oil now back in stock at infowarstore.com. And when I forget to take it, I really feel it.
[2:25:35.000 --> 2:25:39.000]  When I take a couple of them before I go to sleep at night, it makes my dreams even more amazing.
[2:25:39.000 --> 2:25:42.000]  Blizzard thought I was joking. You've tried it out and most of you have been blown away.
[2:25:42.000 --> 2:25:51.000]  Get your fish oil today at infowarstore.com. Ultimate Fish Oil, infowarstore.com.
[2:25:51.000 --> 2:25:57.000]  14 months ago, I told you that the global lockdown was going to kill tens of millions of people by starvation
[2:25:57.000 --> 2:26:01.000]  and was going to cause a global depression in the first world. And now it has.
[2:26:01.000 --> 2:26:06.000]  It was a no-brainer then that you should get high-quality, storeable food and save it
[2:26:06.000 --> 2:26:10.000]  because it is insurance you can eat. And with all the inflation we knew was coming,
[2:26:10.000 --> 2:26:15.000]  that was one way to be inflation. A lot of you listened. You did a great job.
[2:26:15.000 --> 2:26:20.000]  Some of you didn't. Now is the time to take action before food prices only continue to increase.
[2:26:20.000 --> 2:26:26.000]  Every index shows it. It's basically a guarantee barring a miracle. And we wish it wasn't the case.
[2:26:26.000 --> 2:26:32.000]  But let's make lemonade out of these limits. For only a few days more, until next Wednesday, May 12th,
[2:26:32.000 --> 2:26:40.000]  you can get 2020 prices still at PrepareWithAlex.com. And then the prices are going to have to go back to what they were,
[2:26:40.000 --> 2:26:44.000]  still lower than most major competitors, and the food is the highest quality you're going to find.
[2:26:44.000 --> 2:26:51.000]  PrepareWithAlex.com. Take action now. PrepareWithAlex.com. Secure your food while you still can.
[2:26:51.000 --> 2:26:58.000]  Fourteen months ago, I began to see on the broadcast every day when the first world collapses, the third world dies.
[2:26:58.000 --> 2:27:04.000]  We have such a complex civilization with so many billions of moving parts that when you shut down the first world,
[2:27:04.000 --> 2:27:10.000]  it causes a chain reaction that will devastate the third world and really hurt the first world.
[2:27:10.000 --> 2:27:13.000]  Well, now you're hearing about gas shortages all over the United States.
[2:27:13.000 --> 2:27:20.000]  That's because the companies and the systems and the drivers that can barely get the job done before delivering gas have been shut down.
[2:27:20.000 --> 2:27:23.000]  Plus, the Keystone Pipeline has been shut down, along with other pipelines.
[2:27:23.000 --> 2:27:30.000]  The left is now blowing up dams across the U.S. We're being shut down. Our coal power plants are off as well.
[2:27:30.000 --> 2:27:35.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, prepare to be a total slave. The third world is imploding as well. The borders have been removed.
[2:27:35.000 --> 2:27:40.000]  Until you wake up, and this is a globalist chai-com takeover, very recent, you have no hope.
[2:27:40.000 --> 2:27:45.000]  They're announcing that there will be less than two-thirds of the gas needed this summer.
[2:27:45.000 --> 2:27:50.000]  So they told you that you're under lockdown one way or another and CNN laughed at you and your family.
[2:28:15.000 --> 2:28:34.000]  Alright, I'm going to make this video for you because I had to video it so that you'll believe me because, frankly, I can't believe it myself.
[2:28:34.000 --> 2:28:45.000]  So here's a brand new sealed, perfectly sealed brand new box of the J&J vaccine.
[2:28:45.000 --> 2:29:13.000]  You can see here, I'm going to bring this open and perfectly on top is this perfectly normal package insert.
[2:29:13.000 --> 2:29:36.000]  It's a lot of safety and efficacy data. In fact, all of the normal information that we would find in a package insert, like the ingredients, that would all be found right here in the package insert.
[2:29:36.000 --> 2:29:46.000]  It must be magic. It's all blank, the whole thing.
[2:29:46.000 --> 2:29:57.000]  So for this part, that's the only thing not blank. Are you kidding me?
[2:29:57.000 --> 2:30:10.000]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, Robert Barnes is here with us and I also want to take calls, but some of those will have to be held in the next hour, but I will get to some Ed and a few of the other callers have been holding a really long time like Brian and others.
[2:30:10.000 --> 2:30:19.000]  But I do want to talk to you next hour and hear your stories about the vaccines. I really appreciate you holding, but there is a pharmacist showing there's no insert and that's confirmed.
[2:30:19.000 --> 2:30:30.000]  So no paper trail, no testing, no nothing, and they're all over the national news saying this is the case. You've got to accept it, just bow down and worship it all.
[2:30:30.000 --> 2:30:38.000]  How do you respond as a person? I mean, we've got to have pushback. CNN, MSNBC, they're all saying it's time to bully people.
[2:30:38.000 --> 2:30:52.000]  The Yankees or the Mets are saying, oh, the new thing is you'll be segregated if you're not vaccinated. And then your medical records are going to be on an iPhone. You've got to have a phone to be able to have a menu or a job or get on a plane.
[2:30:52.000 --> 2:31:02.000]  I mean, this is a total obvious big tech takeover and then big tech is censoring everybody that tries to talk about it.
[2:31:02.000 --> 2:31:11.000]  And we've been talking about it for a year. You look at where Bill Gates' roadmap is. I mean, for a long time, Alex, you've always looked at the white papers to be able to predict where people are going to go.
[2:31:11.000 --> 2:31:20.000]  Well, I mean, what you've been doing, what we've been doing for a year is you look at the patents that Bill Gates has been requesting and it's going to go from your phone to inside your body.
[2:31:20.000 --> 2:31:27.000]  I mean, that's what a quantum tattoo does. It provides information. Bill Gates is even designing it so there's remote controls.
[2:31:27.000 --> 2:31:32.000]  Why do you need a remote control for something in your own body? Why does somebody else need that remote control?
[2:31:32.000 --> 2:31:42.000]  So the goal will be to have all that information right there on a little chip underneath your skin. That's what the quantum tattoo effectively is, one that monitors whether you've had the vaccines, what drugs you've had.
[2:31:42.000 --> 2:31:50.000]  Ultimately, it could be incorporated for other purposes, whether information, identification, currency, banking access, who knows where it could go.
[2:31:50.000 --> 2:31:57.000]  There's technology afoot that could all develop it. And we have to resist and push back against this Bill Gates dystopian nightmare.
[2:31:57.000 --> 2:32:03.000]  And that's where that happens in three different spaces. One, the Court of Public Information and the Court of Public Opinion.
[2:32:03.000 --> 2:32:11.000]  And that's where what InfoWars is doing, what the InfoWars audience is doing, what ordinary people are doing is critically essential and fundamental.
[2:32:11.000 --> 2:32:16.000]  Because a year ago, I guarantee you, they didn't think there would be any problem. People can go back and watch a year and a half.
[2:32:16.000 --> 2:32:27.000]  Watch Event 201. Watch the closing arguments at Event 201. For those who may not know, Event 201 was sponsored by the Gates Foundation back in September of 2019,
[2:32:27.000 --> 2:32:39.000]  where they had leaders from the military, from Big Pharma, from Big Media, from governments across the country, talk about what would happen if we had a pandemic in response to a coronavirus pandemic.
[2:32:39.000 --> 2:32:43.000]  And so it's just a few months before it actually unearths on the world.
[2:32:43.000 --> 2:32:50.000]  And explain why that's important. We've caught foreign governments, major intelligence agencies, when they're going to stage a terror attack or a war,
[2:32:50.000 --> 2:32:57.000]  they'll run drills that are basically the same, so that if they get caught, they go, oh, that was just part of a drill.
[2:32:57.000 --> 2:33:03.000]  And also it creates extra chatter to confuse your enemies. So they ran a drill while they were launching it, of the same thing,
[2:33:03.000 --> 2:33:09.000]  so their own personnel wouldn't get busted by compartmentalized agencies that weren't part of the attack.
[2:33:09.000 --> 2:33:13.000]  So it gets a script. It's a script.
[2:33:13.000 --> 2:33:21.000]  Yeah, it was both preconditioning people to accept this when it came out, and it was intelligence gathering. Gates found out what was weak and strong,
[2:33:21.000 --> 2:33:26.000]  and what was their main obsession? Their main obsession was having trusted sources of information.
[2:33:26.000 --> 2:33:34.000]  That's right. Right about six months before they said, now we've got to get the anti-vaxxers banned. It's not just the Trump people, it's the anti-vaxxers.
[2:33:34.000 --> 2:33:39.000]  We've got to get medical. It was all over the news. It was so obvious. Barnes, my God.
[2:33:39.000 --> 2:33:44.000]  And see, I'm not kissing your butt, but it's true. You're one of the few people I can get on that sees all the things I see.
[2:33:44.000 --> 2:33:47.000]  I mean, when you pull back and look at it, it's totally synthetic.
[2:33:47.000 --> 2:33:53.000]  Like, how did I know when I was 10 years old that a new flavor of Coke was coming out? Coke Cherry.
[2:33:53.000 --> 2:33:58.000]  It was in every magazine, every newspaper, every TV ad. For six months, Coke Cherry, Coke Cherry, Coke Cherry.
[2:33:58.000 --> 2:34:02.000]  They're like, coronavirus is coming. We're going to take all your rights, and no one's allowed to question it,
[2:34:02.000 --> 2:34:07.000]  and you're going to be checkpoints and martial law. And here's all the drills and get ready for it.
[2:34:07.000 --> 2:34:13.000]  And vaccines are safe, and you must take them. And then, boom, this happens. This is ridiculous.
[2:34:13.000 --> 2:34:18.000]  Oh, exactly. And people can watch it for themselves. They videotape some of those conferences at Event 201.
[2:34:18.000 --> 2:34:24.000]  You can still see them on YouTube, where they're talking about what was their main group of disinformation they were worried about?
[2:34:24.000 --> 2:34:29.000]  People connected to vaccines. Another little insightful thing, by the way, was during that, is one of them says,
[2:34:29.000 --> 2:34:36.000]  you know, the problem is, most pandemics only last a couple of months, and that's not quick enough to get a vaccine up and running.
[2:34:36.000 --> 2:34:44.000]  So what they learned from that is, they needed to extend the length of this pandemic in order to justify having a vaccine in the first place
[2:34:44.000 --> 2:34:54.000]  as any conceivable solution, and then get people to forget the fact that vaccines take several years for even the metal U.S. medical authorities to call them safe.
[2:34:54.000 --> 2:34:58.000]  And that's why these are not safe, according to their own U.S. medical standards.
[2:34:58.000 --> 2:35:06.000]  Let's be clear. You may get a batch of, say, tetanus. So tetanus is a totally real vaccine. You get it. Protects you from tetanus. It's real.
[2:35:06.000 --> 2:35:16.000]  But then there's famously contamination, and anything contaminated with tetanus, you become totally allergic to, and you have an autoimmune response as well, particularly tetanus.
[2:35:16.000 --> 2:35:23.000]  And so, so many people get sick and die from tetanus shots, because if it's contaminated, my uncle almost died from a tetanus shot.
[2:35:23.000 --> 2:35:29.000]  My dad's brother, who's in the hospital for two weeks, he swole up and almost died. He was a young man then. So what I'm saying is we all know these stories,
[2:35:29.000 --> 2:35:36.000]  but this isn't just old-fashioned vaccines that had problems that they tried to deny. This is a whole new kettle of fish.
[2:35:36.000 --> 2:35:45.000]  Oh, completely. I mean, for people who, I mean, the worst consequence ever of a screwed-up vaccine experimentation was what happened with the polio vaccine in the Belgian Congo,
[2:35:45.000 --> 2:35:54.000]  and that likely was the source of AIDS. I mean, so that, when you talk about unintended consequences, I was debating this with some friends about why worry about the vaccine.
[2:35:54.000 --> 2:36:05.000]  I'm like, we're not going to know about the worst consequence about the vaccine, likely, until years from now. And there's lots of historical examples of that being really, really, really bad, much worse than a pandemic could ever be.
[2:36:05.000 --> 2:36:11.000]  And that's why we have to fight back and how you have to push back. But the first way to, I mean, I'm doing what I can in the legal arena.
[2:36:11.000 --> 2:36:17.000]  Others are doing what they can in the political arena, but what the entire audience is doing in the court of public opinion is equally essential.
[2:36:17.000 --> 2:36:20.000]  Their goal is to not have these voices heard.
[2:36:20.000 --> 2:36:30.000]  And their goal is to take this interview once it is posted in Band-Aid Video. Our goal is for all of you to share it. This is truth. This is key. This is reality.
[2:36:30.000 --> 2:36:39.000]  Listeners need to understand their power. I know most of them do, but as more and more of our listeners realize that and repost and cut clips out and share it, it's having a huge effect right now.
[2:36:39.000 --> 2:36:48.000]  Absolutely. In the InfoWars audience, I was doing things like getting Vitamin D, things that they're now recognizing were valuable all along, but we're trying to pretend otherwise before.
[2:36:48.000 --> 2:36:56.000]  I mean, I get the Winner Sun product. The people that were doing that were actually in much better, healthier space than those who were not.
[2:36:56.000 --> 2:37:02.000]  And there was a continued effort to sort of deny that and pretend otherwise because they wanted to make the vaccine the only solution.
[2:37:02.000 --> 2:37:09.000]  By law, they couldn't get emergency authorization unless there was no other mediation or treatment like ivermectin or hydroxychloroquine.
[2:37:09.000 --> 2:37:17.000]  That's exactly right. That's why there was a war on that because that's the precondition for an emergency use authorization under the law is that there'd be no other therapy.
[2:37:17.000 --> 2:37:27.000]  And again, day one, they were ready a year and two months ago, which shows they've been lockstep following a script, which is what the Rockefeller plan for all this is called Operation Lockstep.
[2:37:27.000 --> 2:37:34.000]  Exactly. And this goes way back. Rockefeller has been thinking about this for many, many decades. This has been an elite agenda.
[2:37:34.000 --> 2:37:39.000]  They were funding viruses to give you cancer in the 20s. Stay there. Robert Barnes is on fire. He's probably got to go, but I'm going to see.
[2:37:39.000 --> 2:37:48.000]  I want to go to your calls next segment. I can twist his arm, do a few more segments next hour, get the Chauvin federal indictment, Trump, the recount and so much more.
[2:37:48.000 --> 2:37:50.000]  He's nodding his head. Hopefully you can. We'll see.
[2:37:50.000 --> 2:38:00.000]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021. And I just want to say something. I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over the years.
[2:38:00.000 --> 2:38:05.000]  It is truly an answer to prayer. And I am so blessed and thankful for all of you, the listeners of this show.
[2:38:05.000 --> 2:38:11.000]  I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you. Whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter.
[2:38:11.000 --> 2:38:20.000]  You've got red blood. And if you love freedom and justice, and if you love our innocent children, we are brothers and sisters together.
[2:38:20.000 --> 2:38:27.000]  And it has just been an incredible experience to work with you over the years. And as crazier things are, I want to keep working under the future.
[2:38:27.000 --> 2:38:35.000]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God. So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us.
[2:38:35.000 --> 2:38:42.000]  But again, that's up to you and your relationship with God. I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've done.
[2:38:42.000 --> 2:38:50.000]  And just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you. And hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support InfoWars. God bless.
[2:38:50.000 --> 2:38:56.000]  When listeners call into the show and thank me for all I've done, I always stop them and I say, thank you for what you've done.
[2:38:56.000 --> 2:39:02.000]  Thank you for keeping InfoWars on the air. Thank you for praying for us. And thank you for spreading the word.
[2:39:02.000 --> 2:39:13.000]  If all of you will simply go to InfoWarsStore.com and get a privacy pocket for your iPhone or a droid, it will teach you and others that these things are surveilling you.
[2:39:13.000 --> 2:39:19.000]  It will remind you every day, like it does me and my family, and it will protect where you go and what you do.
[2:39:19.000 --> 2:39:25.000]  Not because you've done something wrong, but because the big telecoms, big tech, and the globalists are predatory and are evil.
[2:39:25.000 --> 2:39:31.000]  And in the surveillance state, we need to more and more start doing everything we can to mitigate the criminal activity they're involved in.
[2:39:31.000 --> 2:39:39.000]  These are the highest quality, highest ratings. They're available at InfoWarsStore.com in four different colors and they are only $19.95.
[2:39:39.000 --> 2:39:46.000]  The exact same pocket is sold for $24.95 or even $29.95 everywhere. They're available right now for $19.95 and they fund the InfoWars.
[2:39:46.000 --> 2:39:51.000]  Please take action today. Protect your privacy and fund the InfoWars.
[2:39:51.000 --> 2:39:59.000]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone from beta testing to operational.
[2:39:59.000 --> 2:40:04.000]  The globalists are out on the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot takeover.
[2:40:04.000 --> 2:40:12.000]  But the good news is we've been working and you've been working, and others have been working across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to find it off.
[2:40:12.000 --> 2:40:18.000]  Humanity is strong. We're incredible. And if we're aware of the attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating it.
[2:40:18.000 --> 2:40:27.000]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it. So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential, and warning others is absolutely essential.
[2:40:27.000 --> 2:40:37.000]  And at the same time, supporting InfoWars by buying high-quality products to keep us on air is essential because they're great products for you and your family and they're also funding our operation.
[2:40:37.000 --> 2:40:47.000]  InfoWarsStore.com. InfoWarsStore.com is incredible. A lot of our products that have been sold out because the supply chain breakdowns are back in like bodies, vasobites and others.
[2:40:47.000 --> 2:40:52.000]  So get them today at InfoWarsStore.com and I thank you for being part of the resistance.
[2:40:52.000 --> 2:40:59.000]  The federal government commissioned secret radiation experiments on thousands of non-consenting patients.
[2:40:59.000 --> 2:41:12.000]  Hundreds of hospitals in the U.S. injected healthy men, women and children with uranium and plutonium at dosage levels ranging from non-therapeutic to lethal, killing many of the test subjects.
[2:41:12.000 --> 2:41:23.000]  In-game blueprint for global enslavement is one of the most important films ever made. Fourteen years ago, we tracked and documented the Bilderberg Group's activities and they're planned for a great reset using the threat of a fake virus.
[2:41:23.000 --> 2:41:32.000]  The film now is more important than ever. When it's shot to number one on Amazon last year, they banned it. We have it back in print available now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[2:41:32.000 --> 2:41:42.000]  Selling them as low as $3.95 a piece of the environment bulk and there's a zero country code. So anywhere on the planet, you can make copies. In fact, I want you to make copies. You are the Paul Revere's.
[2:41:42.000 --> 2:42:06.000]  In-game blueprint for global enslavement available now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[2:42:06.000 --> 2:42:16.000]  All right, you got Robert Barnes who's filing suit next week with Robert Kennedy Jr. That is a big, big deal against the folks violating the Nuremberg code.
[2:42:16.000 --> 2:42:24.000]  And so I appreciate listeners that have been holding, adding many others. Barnes is going to do 20 minutes to the next hour on some other subjects and we'll go back to your calls.
[2:42:24.000 --> 2:42:33.000]  I'm going to go to calls right now on the vaccines. And so let's go ahead and talk to Ed in Ohio. Thanks for holding over. Repeat what's going on with your grandmother.
[2:42:33.000 --> 2:42:37.000]  And then you got Robert Barnes here. Have you got any comments or questions for him?
[2:42:37.000 --> 2:42:50.000]  Yes, sir. Well, my grandmother and grandfather against my advisement, Wendell got the shot and her liver is shutting down.
[2:42:50.000 --> 2:43:14.000]  The test fitter and her Billy Rubin count was absolutely off the chart, they said. The questions that I had for Mr. Barnes was about legal things with.
[2:43:14.000 --> 2:43:26.000]  I've been using a 42 U.S. code subsection 2000 for the places that are trying to tell me I can't come in because, well, this is a private business.
[2:43:26.000 --> 2:43:37.000]  But under that, it says it as a point of public access. I wanted to get his take and anything that he could think to recommend.
[2:43:37.000 --> 2:43:45.000]  I'm putting together a packet currently to go out. What do you say you're trying to go to the grocery store, especially for old folks that can't go 20 miles away to another one.
[2:43:45.000 --> 2:43:53.000]  They want you to wear a mask, but you've got emphysema, you've got anxiety disorders, whatever. They're illegally trying to make you wear a burka.
[2:43:53.000 --> 2:43:58.000]  What is a good legal response for the average person without you giving them individual advice because you don't know the case.
[2:43:58.000 --> 2:44:02.000]  But what would you do, Barnes?
[2:44:02.000 --> 2:44:14.000]  We've actually filed suit against a range of places, including grocery stores, including hospitals, including medical facilities, including educational institutions,
[2:44:14.000 --> 2:44:26.000]  because where they were trying to require a mask for people who are exempted from the mask due to their health condition, which can include also anxiety, but also breathing issues, other issues.
[2:44:26.000 --> 2:44:35.000]  And so we're suing under the ADA, the Discrimination Act that prohibits discrimination against anyone who is perceived as disabled.
[2:44:35.000 --> 2:44:43.000]  We're going to be doing the same thing actually in the context of the vaccines, because my view is that requiring someone to have a vaccine is a perception that they're disabled,
[2:44:43.000 --> 2:44:52.000]  and then treating them differently based on that perception is discriminating against them based on your perception of their disability, and that too is prohibited by the ADA.
[2:44:52.000 --> 2:44:57.000]  And state analogous laws that are also similar that have the same principles and precepts in place.
[2:44:57.000 --> 2:45:02.000]  That's what I should have pointed out. You've already filed a bunch of suits. You're a real trooper, Barnes.
[2:45:02.000 --> 2:45:11.000]  Yeah, well, exactly. We've already started firing away. So on the mask cases, we already have several suits filed across the country. We're filing more across the country.
[2:45:11.000 --> 2:45:18.000]  Hey, can you come on the war room today or maybe next week? Come on my show and just talk about the suits themselves, because this is fascinating. We need to fight back.
[2:45:18.000 --> 2:45:27.000]  Oh, yes, absolutely. And I'll be drafting some letters. I'm going to be putting up the suits on a website so that people can see them.
[2:45:27.000 --> 2:45:37.000]  There won't be any copyright asserted so people can copy and paste and do whatever they want with them. It's not legal advice, but whatever you do with it, that's up to you.
[2:45:37.000 --> 2:45:40.000]  And if you want to utilize it in a certain way, God bless you.
[2:45:40.000 --> 2:45:50.000]  So we did the same thing back during the election context and got a bunch of people to write letters to their congressmen and senators that led to a very effective part of that campaign politically.
[2:45:50.000 --> 2:45:56.000]  We're going to do the same thing so that people can see what can I explain to my employer? What can I explain to my educational institute?
[2:45:56.000 --> 2:46:02.000]  Well, that's right. They're trying to see legal now at city council and school board meetings and people don't wear masks and say we don't want to wear masks.
[2:46:02.000 --> 2:46:10.000]  The police are investigating. Well, we're investigating you. You know, the human smugglers, the borders open, the masks give you bacterial pneumonia. It's all a damn fraud.
[2:46:10.000 --> 2:46:18.000]  Knock it off. It's supposed to be 15 days to cut the curve. No, it's going to be 50 million years of slavery. They don't say no.
[2:46:18.000 --> 2:46:25.000]  So there you go. That's what my wife does. She says, hey, I have a disability. She has anxiety over it. I do too. I mean, I literally hate it.
[2:46:25.000 --> 2:46:32.000]  I mean, we're in a burka. And when they get rude, she goes, hey, back off. And they always back off. And now people go, I agree with you.
[2:46:32.000 --> 2:46:38.000]  And now they don't even mess with us. You've got to push back. Thanks for the call, Ed. James is a paramedic.
[2:46:38.000 --> 2:46:43.000]  I really appreciate holding in his busy time. We got so many calls though. That just goes to the territory.
[2:46:43.000 --> 2:46:49.000]  There's a paramedic says he created three separate patients having reactions. James, tell us about it.
[2:46:49.000 --> 2:46:58.000]  Yeah, Mr. Jones, I really appreciate you taking my call. I do need some time to discuss this because people have to listen to what I have to say.
[2:46:58.000 --> 2:47:09.000]  There is a compromised, the cities in the fight amongst our compromise, and we are not able to really help the people that we need to be helping here and people have to hear this.
[2:47:09.000 --> 2:47:18.000]  So you have to give them the time to be able to talk about how they're compromised, what I saw, how we're not able to document and get a litany plug.
[2:47:18.000 --> 2:47:25.000]  Tell folks with your, because I really respect paramedics. Doctors will tell you they know as much, way more than nurses, because you're there when you first get there.
[2:47:25.000 --> 2:47:33.000]  You're saving lives, having to do medical procedures, and you actually get to learn what's really going on. So give us your view on what you're witnessing.
[2:47:33.000 --> 2:47:42.000]  Yeah, so if you remember when Gates said that, you know, they could hire a whole bunch more teachers if we just called a herd, if we just let the older people die.
[2:47:42.000 --> 2:47:47.000]  Yeah, he said, get rid of grandma. We can hire 10 teachers if that's a death panel. You're not supposed to say that.
[2:47:47.000 --> 2:47:58.000]  Exactly. This is this whole process. It's 100%. That's what they're doing. If you think about the teacher union, the leadership right now, that's exactly why these schools are not open, that they're a part of this process.
[2:47:58.000 --> 2:48:01.000]  And I know the teachers are good, just like the firefighters are good.
[2:48:01.000 --> 2:48:08.000]  But sure, you know, the unions want to get rid of regular schooling and they want to get rid of the old people for their pension funds. This is a cult.
[2:48:08.000 --> 2:48:17.000]  Yep. Look, I'm an ISF, a firefighter here, a career firefighter in volunteers, the same way we are a majority conservative, we want to be out there protecting the community.
[2:48:17.000 --> 2:48:24.000]  I can pose to help people, right? I am pissed off right now because I just came off a 24 hour shift. Get a little emotional here.
[2:48:24.000 --> 2:48:33.000]  But 24 hour shifts and I'm seeing people getting sick and dying and not being able to survive what they're getting out of this vaccine and people have to hear this.
[2:48:33.000 --> 2:48:35.000]  Well, tell people what you're witnessing, sir.
[2:48:35.000 --> 2:48:44.000]  All right, so look, the cities and the fire departments are compromised. Okay. They're all getting federal money, tax money, right to push the vaccine to give vaccines.
[2:48:44.000 --> 2:48:50.000]  I got people right now in our agency that are pushing vaccines. We got to go out there on the firefighters getting overtime for doing it.
[2:48:50.000 --> 2:48:56.000]  And the cities and the fire departments are getting a ton of tax money that's helping, you know, getting costs and additional revenue.
[2:48:56.000 --> 2:48:59.000]  So it's in their best interest to do it, right? They're all compromised.
[2:48:59.000 --> 2:49:07.000]  The people that we're seeing, let me tell you how this worked out in state of Washington, right? Governor Inslee, you know, it was putting sick people into the retirement homes, right?
[2:49:07.000 --> 2:49:10.000]  I have a large majority of people that are in my first new area.
[2:49:10.000 --> 2:49:19.000]  Sure, it's not just Cuomo. It was a strategic plan. Also in Europe, they put sick people in to kill the old.
[2:49:19.000 --> 2:49:23.000]  That's why we got to put these puzzle pieces together, okay?
[2:49:23.000 --> 2:49:31.000]  They put the sick people into these retirement homes, right? People are already compromised, right? So we have healthier, younger people that have COVID that went in.
[2:49:31.000 --> 2:49:38.000]  They got sick. So what we were seeing here in January and February where these places would just have all of a sudden the entire complex would be sick with COVID, okay?
[2:49:38.000 --> 2:49:42.000]  Now, a lot of people would recover, right? But they weren't able to get the therapeutic, okay?
[2:49:42.000 --> 2:49:49.000]  So now when the people get sick in these places, they're getting the therapeutics and they'll have 100% recovery rate, right?
[2:49:49.000 --> 2:49:54.000]  So what we saw at the very beginning was people were coming in, they were getting sick, inspecting everybody, right?
[2:49:54.000 --> 2:50:05.000]  Okay, and now when we gave the COVID vaccines to all these retirement homes and all these older people, within two weeks to a month, they were all getting, not all, there were a lot of patients were coming down with some unexplained illness,
[2:50:05.000 --> 2:50:11.000]  even though they were isolated, not even able to come out of their apartments or rooms, right? They were getting some unexplained illness, right?
[2:50:11.000 --> 2:50:24.000]  And so all of a sudden it was fatigue, they couldn't move, paralysis, all kinds of things. And we saw a lot of healthy people that had no underlying health conditions that just happened to be older have these issues and were unexplained, right?
[2:50:24.000 --> 2:50:40.000]  Okay, now what we're seeing, now we're six weeks to two months out. And now we're seeing people, I just saw three patients yesterday that right now I'm just letting you everyone know, right, that coincidence is the leading cause of illness, right?
[2:50:40.000 --> 2:50:55.000]  Right now with these vaccines, coincidence, because everyone doesn't want to admit it, okay? I had one 76 year old female patient that had a severe stroke, debilitating, she will not recover because that she was post six weeks from this vaccine.
[2:50:55.000 --> 2:50:58.000]  No underlying medical conditions, never had an issue before.
[2:50:58.000 --> 2:51:08.000]  Okay, had another one that within two weeks had had a rapid onset of dementia, no preexisting conditions, no medical issues, she was in her 70s.
[2:51:08.000 --> 2:51:25.000]  And by the way, sir, we're going to break here, but you've heard the callers, they're all saying the same thing. And as you see the UT study saying exactly what you said, and other studies, brain fog, protein in the brain, autoimmune response, the lungs, the heart, the brain, your body starts eating your organs.
[2:51:25.000 --> 2:51:29.000]  You gotta let me keep going here, I gotta hold you through the break, I'll do it, okay?
[2:51:29.000 --> 2:51:33.000]  I know, but Barnes is here with the other callers, tell us the rest, tell us what else you saw.
[2:51:33.000 --> 2:51:43.000]  So, hey, and then I saw a 21 year old person at Rite Aid, right, that collapsed after receiving, within five minutes collapsed, she was totally out of it.
[2:51:43.000 --> 2:51:50.000]  Her blood pressure was super low, blood sugar was low, you know, that just all of a sudden like she was just out and was really having a hard time.
[2:51:50.000 --> 2:51:58.000]  You know what I'm going to do, sir, you're a well-spoken fellow, and what I'll do is we'll contact you, you can trust us, we'll, we want to copy your ID because we know you're a real paramedic.
[2:51:58.000 --> 2:52:05.000]  We'll say, we vetted you, and then we'll have you on as a guest for 30 minutes with me, or with Owen Shroy or one of the other shows, get his name and number.
[2:52:05.000 --> 2:52:11.000]  I gotta go, sir, I gotta go, we're up to the break, got Barnes here, he's gotta go soon, we're going to get to all the other callers.
[2:52:11.000 --> 2:52:22.000]  James is a normal person, he's upset, he's witnessing it all, he's pissed, get his name and number, we'll get his, these are all real people calling, but we're going to have him as a guest, we vetted.
[2:52:22.000 --> 2:52:26.000]  And then we can have a paramedic on and tell you what he's seeing in the Bill Gates state of Washington.
[2:52:26.000 --> 2:52:29.000]  Hour number four straight ahead with Robert Barnes to comment on that.
[2:52:29.000 --> 2:52:39.000]  More calls, then we're going to get the new indictments with the Justice Department, the showbond trial and other officers, and so much more, and Antifa setting up checkpoints all over the country.
[2:52:39.000 --> 2:52:44.000]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut, you're on the air, thanks for holding.
[2:52:44.000 --> 2:52:45.000]  Hello, can you hear me?
[2:52:45.000 --> 2:52:46.000]  I sure can, sir, thank you.
[2:52:46.000 --> 2:52:53.000]  Hey Alex, before I start, man, I just wanted to talk to you, bro, and it's a pleasure to be talking right now with you, man.
[2:52:53.000 --> 2:52:55.000]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[2:52:55.000 --> 2:52:59.000]  I'm from California, New Brink, Connecticut, and I just want to plug in.
[2:52:59.000 --> 2:53:03.000]  I'm a truck driver and two before us have changed the way I drive.
[2:53:03.000 --> 2:53:10.000]  Me and my brothers that drive, and a couple of us, we're all Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans.
[2:53:10.000 --> 2:53:19.000]  We used to be on Monster and Red Bull and Rolla, and I have lost weight because I stopped drinking all that sugar, and I just want to thank you for that, man.
[2:53:19.000 --> 2:53:24.000]  Well, brother, we put more in this than any other long term high quality energy powder there is.
[2:53:24.000 --> 2:53:29.000]  So this was designed by one of the top guys in the country, he didn't want his name on it, because obviously the political issues,
[2:53:29.000 --> 2:53:32.000]  but we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it.
[2:53:32.000 --> 2:53:39.000]  And we believe it is the best, strongest, but healthiest energy out there, and you're saying that it's made your life better, so that means a lot to me, thank you.
[2:53:39.000 --> 2:53:41.000]  To all your truck drivers, we love you.
[2:53:41.000 --> 2:53:53.000]  Your brain, your heart, your bones, your liver, your eyes, everything has a better shot at surviving in this crazy environment when you have high quality fish oil.
[2:53:53.000 --> 2:53:54.000]  We've got the best out there.
[2:53:54.000 --> 2:53:59.000]  We have the highest grade of fish oil available, and what it does for your body is simply amazing.
[2:53:59.000 --> 2:54:06.000]  Everybody already knows what high quality fish oil does, and it costs us even more to put it through a process to remove any trace mercury that's in it.
[2:54:06.000 --> 2:54:07.000]  So this is also clean fish oil.
[2:54:07.000 --> 2:54:10.000]  It's been sold out for months, but it's back in stock 50% off.
[2:54:10.000 --> 2:54:12.000]  Grille oil is set to sell out.
[2:54:12.000 --> 2:54:13.000]  It's amazing as well.

[2:54:40.000 --> 2:54:47.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:55:04.000 --> 2:55:05.000]  Alright, Robert Barnes is our guest.
[2:55:05.000 --> 2:55:07.000]  He just heard that desperate paramedic.
[2:55:07.000 --> 2:55:11.000]  He wanted to stay on it, just telling us three calls a day.
[2:55:11.000 --> 2:55:14.000]  People collapsing, people getting sick, people dying.
[2:55:14.000 --> 2:55:16.000]  Oh, people can't get out of bed.
[2:55:16.000 --> 2:55:18.000]  We've had the nursing home managers call them.
[2:55:18.000 --> 2:55:21.000]  They go, yeah, we've got 20 people, we've got 50, we've got 100.
[2:55:21.000 --> 2:55:22.000]  It's always the same story.
[2:55:22.000 --> 2:55:24.000]  Suddenly, none of them come to dinner for a week.
[2:55:24.000 --> 2:55:25.000]  Then a bunch start dying.
[2:55:25.000 --> 2:55:28.000]  This was all pre-planned, Barnes.
[2:55:28.000 --> 2:55:30.000]  Clearly, we can see the design.
[2:55:30.000 --> 2:55:33.000]  They admit it's their plan.
[2:55:33.000 --> 2:55:35.000]  Will they get away with it?
[2:55:35.000 --> 2:55:38.000]  I think, and I know, they're getting a lot more pushback
[2:55:38.000 --> 2:55:39.000]  than I think they thought they'd get.
[2:55:39.000 --> 2:55:41.000]  What do you think?
[2:55:41.000 --> 2:55:42.000]  No doubt about it.
[2:55:42.000 --> 2:55:43.000]  I mean, they definitely got a lot more pushback
[2:55:43.000 --> 2:55:45.000]  from the court of public opinion,
[2:55:45.000 --> 2:55:48.000]  because in part of shows like this and audiences like these,
[2:55:48.000 --> 2:55:50.000]  because you just look at two years ago,
[2:55:50.000 --> 2:55:53.000]  public opinion about if you labeled a drug vaccine,
[2:55:53.000 --> 2:55:56.000]  magically you would get 90% plus approvals.
[2:55:56.000 --> 2:55:59.000]  They think it's completely safe, totally effective, no problems,
[2:55:59.000 --> 2:56:01.000]  because the last two decades,
[2:56:01.000 --> 2:56:04.000]  they've been very effective suppressing the memory
[2:56:04.000 --> 2:56:06.000]  that a drug is a drug.
[2:56:06.000 --> 2:56:08.000]  You can put any label on it you want.
[2:56:08.000 --> 2:56:09.000]  It's still a drug.
[2:56:09.000 --> 2:56:12.000]  And just calling it a vaccine doesn't make it magically from God.
[2:56:12.000 --> 2:56:15.000]  And so it's still a drug made by a drug company
[2:56:15.000 --> 2:56:17.000]  or the state in some capacity.
[2:56:17.000 --> 2:56:20.000]  And there's a long notorious history of that not turning out well.
[2:56:20.000 --> 2:56:22.000]  A long notorious history of them lying about it.
[2:56:22.000 --> 2:56:25.000]  A long notorious history of it backfiring just a few years,
[2:56:25.000 --> 2:56:27.000]  sometimes many decades.
[2:56:27.000 --> 2:56:29.000]  What are they going to do when the majority of medical doctors,
[2:56:29.000 --> 2:56:33.000]  nurses, and pharmacists I know on the street say it's pure bull?
[2:56:33.000 --> 2:56:37.000]  I mean, I was talking to a high level UT board member yesterday,
[2:56:37.000 --> 2:56:39.000]  and they said, no, my doctor said don't take it.
[2:56:39.000 --> 2:56:40.000]  It's not safe.
[2:56:40.000 --> 2:56:43.000]  So, I mean, the majority of doctors know this is bad.
[2:56:43.000 --> 2:56:46.000]  Oh, I mean, many, well, you look at it disproportionately,
[2:56:46.000 --> 2:56:49.000]  doctors and nurses are the ones that are not willing to take it.
[2:56:49.000 --> 2:56:52.000]  I mean, now you have about 30 to 40% of the country
[2:56:52.000 --> 2:56:55.000]  that has concerns about taking this vaccine,
[2:56:55.000 --> 2:56:58.000]  about the safety and efficacy of it, about being reluctant to take it.
[2:56:58.000 --> 2:57:00.000]  They'll never be able to bully a number.
[2:57:00.000 --> 2:57:02.000]  That's why they want to get us down to maybe 10%,
[2:57:02.000 --> 2:57:04.000]  and they want to practice bullying us,
[2:57:04.000 --> 2:57:07.000]  but they're not getting to the manageable level, are they?
[2:57:07.000 --> 2:57:08.000]  Not at all.
[2:57:08.000 --> 2:57:10.000]  And that's why they started Waging War
[2:57:10.000 --> 2:57:13.000]  with government complicit participants
[2:57:13.000 --> 2:57:15.000]  against Bobby Kennedy's organization
[2:57:15.000 --> 2:57:17.000]  and the Children's Health Defense, the defender.
[2:57:17.000 --> 2:57:20.000]  Because they have a suit that's actually pending in California
[2:57:20.000 --> 2:57:23.000]  that arguments are taking place this week
[2:57:23.000 --> 2:57:25.000]  about whether it can go forward against Facebook,
[2:57:25.000 --> 2:57:28.000]  against Zuckerberg on the grounds that Zuckerberg
[2:57:28.000 --> 2:57:31.000]  was acting as a secret agent of the government
[2:57:31.000 --> 2:57:33.000]  in suppressing the information
[2:57:33.000 --> 2:57:36.000]  that Bobby Kennedy's organization was trying to get out there.
[2:57:36.000 --> 2:57:38.000]  And all he does is distribute information
[2:57:38.000 --> 2:57:39.000]  that's publicly available.
[2:57:39.000 --> 2:57:41.000]  And by the way, did you see Mercola's letter
[2:57:41.000 --> 2:57:43.000]  where he shows that he and 11 others,
[2:57:43.000 --> 2:57:46.000]  including Robert Kennedy Jr., were listed basically as terrorists
[2:57:46.000 --> 2:57:48.000]  by Bill Gates Foundation's subgroup,
[2:57:48.000 --> 2:57:51.000]  and they said you cyber command the Pentagon of the Army
[2:57:51.000 --> 2:57:52.000]  physically against them.
[2:57:52.000 --> 2:57:54.000]  So Big Pharma is so desperate now,
[2:57:54.000 --> 2:57:56.000]  not up to kill the old folks, the old folks' homes.
[2:57:56.000 --> 2:58:00.000]  Now they're literally talking about using counterterrorism forces
[2:58:00.000 --> 2:58:03.000]  against Robert Kennedy Jr.
[2:58:03.000 --> 2:58:05.000]  Exactly, and this is Bobby Kennedy Jr.
[2:58:05.000 --> 2:58:07.000]  I mean, he's not some right winger.
[2:58:07.000 --> 2:58:09.000]  I mean, he comes from those prominent liberal democratic family
[2:58:09.000 --> 2:58:11.000]  in the history of the country.
[2:58:11.000 --> 2:58:14.000]  But he's just willing to raise questions about,
[2:58:14.000 --> 2:58:16.000]  he believes in informed consent,
[2:58:16.000 --> 2:58:18.000]  and he's willing to raise questions about the medical establishment
[2:58:18.000 --> 2:58:20.000]  because he's seen them lie over time.
[2:58:20.000 --> 2:58:22.000]  And he's been willing to raise questions about the-
[2:58:22.000 --> 2:58:24.000]  Whatever happened to my body, my choice.
[2:58:24.000 --> 2:58:25.000]  Exactly.
[2:58:25.000 --> 2:58:27.000]  And that's his core view across the board.
[2:58:27.000 --> 2:58:30.000]  And he's willing to distrust the white lab coat crowd,
[2:58:30.000 --> 2:58:32.000]  and distrust the intelligence apparatus,
[2:58:32.000 --> 2:58:36.000]  and he has been highly critical, especially, of Bill Gates.
[2:58:36.000 --> 2:58:39.000]  Talking about Bill Gates and overlapping involvement in Big Tech,
[2:58:39.000 --> 2:58:41.000]  Big Ag, and Big Pharma,
[2:58:41.000 --> 2:58:45.000]  and that's a scary combination to have one billionaire,
[2:58:45.000 --> 2:58:48.000]  one oligarch, and a disproportionate influence
[2:58:48.000 --> 2:58:50.000]  in those three economic areas,
[2:58:50.000 --> 2:58:53.000]  then you combine it with the way he has co-opted and bought off
[2:58:53.000 --> 2:58:56.000]  almost every public health authority in the world
[2:58:56.000 --> 2:58:58.000]  not just the World Health Organization,
[2:58:58.000 --> 2:59:00.000]  but almost every other public health authority.
[2:59:00.000 --> 2:59:02.000]  And the only few he's been outed from
[2:59:02.000 --> 2:59:04.000]  is the countries he's been exposed in,
[2:59:04.000 --> 2:59:07.000]  like in India and like in parts of Africa.
[2:59:07.000 --> 2:59:10.000]  And it's only a matter of time before the country comes
[2:59:10.000 --> 2:59:12.000]  to the awakening of who Bill Gates is.
[2:59:12.000 --> 2:59:15.000]  But what's great is we are at record levels
[2:59:15.000 --> 2:59:18.000]  of public recognition of the risks of vaccines
[2:59:18.000 --> 2:59:21.000]  and Big Pharma and state coercion.
[2:59:21.000 --> 2:59:23.000]  We're at record levels of the American people
[2:59:23.000 --> 2:59:26.000]  knowing about the Nuremberg Code and the informed consent rights
[2:59:26.000 --> 2:59:29.000]  and the limits of emergency use authorization.
[2:59:29.000 --> 2:59:31.000]  So the world is changing, thanks in large part,
[2:59:31.000 --> 2:59:33.000]  to programs like Infowars.
[2:59:33.000 --> 2:59:36.000]  And the Infowars audience continuing to not only support Infowars
[2:59:36.000 --> 2:59:38.000]  by going to Infowarsstore.com,
[2:59:38.000 --> 2:59:41.000]  but also by getting the messages and sharing the links
[2:59:41.000 --> 2:59:42.000]  and sharing the content.
[2:59:42.000 --> 2:59:44.000]  Well, that's right. I mean, Kennedy's speaking to crowds
[2:59:44.000 --> 2:59:46.000]  of a million plus people panicking.
[2:59:46.000 --> 2:59:48.000]  We'll be right back in 60 seconds.
[2:59:49.000 --> 2:59:52.000]  Alex Jones here with some really good news.
[2:59:52.000 --> 2:59:55.000]  Four of our best-selling products are back in stock.
[2:59:55.000 --> 2:59:58.000]  Four of these bad boys that will enrich your life
[2:59:58.000 --> 3:00:00.000]  and, of course, funding Infowars.
[3:00:00.000 --> 3:00:02.000]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula.
[3:00:02.000 --> 3:00:05.000]  Alpha power for your stamina, libido, energy.
[3:00:05.000 --> 3:00:07.000]  Prosthetic guard with a soft palmetto
[3:00:07.000 --> 3:00:10.000]  and a bunch of key vitamins and minerals for your immune system.
[3:00:10.000 --> 3:00:13.000]  And, of course, vaso-beach, concentrated beet extract
[3:00:13.000 --> 3:00:15.000]  to create nipersoxide in your blood
[3:00:15.000 --> 3:00:18.000]  that's essential for your heart and for your lungs
[3:00:18.000 --> 3:00:20.000]  and especially for your liver.
[3:00:20.000 --> 3:00:22.000]  And this is great because with all the shutdowns
[3:00:22.000 --> 3:00:24.000]  and the lockdowns, it's been hard to get these products
[3:00:24.000 --> 3:00:25.000]  and they're finally back in
[3:00:25.000 --> 3:00:27.000]  and they're critical to funding our operation.
[3:00:27.000 --> 3:00:28.000]  Plus, they're great products.

[3:00:40.000 --> 3:00:51.000]  at Infowarsstore.com.
[3:00:51.000 --> 3:01:06.000]  You are listening to an Infowars.com frontline report.
[3:01:06.000 --> 3:01:08.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[3:01:08.000 --> 3:01:10.000]  All right, we got doctors, we got nurses,
[3:01:10.000 --> 3:01:13.000]  we got paramedics, we got them lined up massively.
[3:01:13.000 --> 3:01:15.000]  And I'm going to get to everybody on the board.
[3:01:15.000 --> 3:01:18.000]  Danny, Brian, Russell, Mike, Katie, Brian,
[3:01:18.000 --> 3:01:21.000]  Ginny, James, and Lynn.
[3:01:21.000 --> 3:01:22.000]  You may all just get a minute or half or so,
[3:01:22.000 --> 3:01:24.000]  but I'll get to every one of you and I appreciate you holding.
[3:01:24.000 --> 3:01:26.000]  I also need to hit, and I was sending up checkpoints
[3:01:26.000 --> 3:01:29.000]  attacking people around the country and in Europe,
[3:01:29.000 --> 3:01:30.000]  and what's behind that.
[3:01:30.000 --> 3:01:31.000]  I'll do that in the last segment.
[3:01:31.000 --> 3:01:34.000]  But, Barnes, before you get out of here,
[3:01:34.000 --> 3:01:36.000]  spend a few minutes on other issues.
[3:01:36.000 --> 3:01:38.000]  Good news, people are waking up.
[3:01:38.000 --> 3:01:40.000]  They thought they'd have 90% vaccine by now.
[3:01:40.000 --> 3:01:42.000]  They're closing their vaccine centers around the world.
[3:01:42.000 --> 3:01:43.000]  People aren't buying it.
[3:01:43.000 --> 3:01:45.000]  You're leading the charge on that.
[3:01:45.000 --> 3:01:46.000]  Robert Kennedy, Jr., we are.
[3:01:46.000 --> 3:01:48.000]  The general public really is the tip of the spear.
[3:01:48.000 --> 3:01:50.000]  If they just educate folks and share your interviews
[3:01:50.000 --> 3:01:52.000]  and my interviews and Robert Kennedy's
[3:01:52.000 --> 3:01:54.000]  and Dale Big Tree and all that,
[3:01:54.000 --> 3:01:56.000]  it's going to be game over.
[3:01:56.000 --> 3:01:59.000]  And if the listeners, all these great nurses and doctors
[3:01:59.000 --> 3:02:01.000]  and medical workers, call and talk radio and say,
[3:02:01.000 --> 3:02:04.000]  this is who I am, or go knock on the local station and say,
[3:02:04.000 --> 3:02:07.000]  here I'm a local doctor and I want to speak.
[3:02:07.000 --> 3:02:09.000]  Without being scared of the local clinic firing you,
[3:02:09.000 --> 3:02:10.000]  they can't fire us all.
[3:02:10.000 --> 3:02:11.000]  I mean, this is a war.
[3:02:11.000 --> 3:02:13.000]  But at least anonymously call in
[3:02:13.000 --> 3:02:15.000]  or anonymously write letters to the editor.
[3:02:15.000 --> 3:02:18.000]  The point is, every person you touch,
[3:02:18.000 --> 3:02:20.000]  even as the person that works at the newspaper,
[3:02:20.000 --> 3:02:22.000]  if they don't even publish it, they still see that.
[3:02:22.000 --> 3:02:24.000]  And so don't let them think that you're powerless.
[3:02:24.000 --> 3:02:27.000]  But what about trying to trigger the riots,
[3:02:27.000 --> 3:02:29.000]  trying to make the financial collapse
[3:02:29.000 --> 3:02:31.000]  because of inflation they've triggered,
[3:02:31.000 --> 3:02:33.000]  look like it's a racial issue this summer.
[3:02:33.000 --> 3:02:36.000]  Clearly, they want to hide the economic crisis they've created,
[3:02:36.000 --> 3:02:38.000]  the consolidation, the lockdown,
[3:02:38.000 --> 3:02:40.000]  knowing this would cause inflation,
[3:02:40.000 --> 3:02:41.000]  knowing it would cause scarcity.
[3:02:41.000 --> 3:02:45.000]  They want to hide that behind racial injustice and use that,
[3:02:45.000 --> 3:02:47.000]  use the collapse in the economy
[3:02:47.000 --> 3:02:49.000]  to even bring globalists into more power
[3:02:49.000 --> 3:02:51.000]  with a universal basic income,
[3:02:51.000 --> 3:02:54.000]  which gives them total control and surveillance
[3:02:54.000 --> 3:02:58.000]  and medical tyranny and forced inoculation for your payment.
[3:02:58.000 --> 3:02:59.000]  That's the holy grail.
[3:02:59.000 --> 3:03:01.000]  We're only a few months away from that.
[3:03:01.000 --> 3:03:05.000]  And then you've got the FEDGEM dieting chauvin and others today.
[3:03:05.000 --> 3:03:07.000]  Talk about that for us.
[3:03:07.000 --> 3:03:08.000]  Sure.
[3:03:08.000 --> 3:03:10.000]  So, I mean, on the Chauvin trial,
[3:03:10.000 --> 3:03:12.000]  what we're seeing is the continued political weaponization
[3:03:12.000 --> 3:03:14.000]  of the entire prosecutorial and police process.
[3:03:14.000 --> 3:03:17.000]  So we're seeing that they want to convert America's police
[3:03:17.000 --> 3:03:19.000]  into their own secret stasi,
[3:03:19.000 --> 3:03:22.000]  their own style KGB operation.
[3:03:22.000 --> 3:03:25.000]  They want a politicized, weaponized police
[3:03:25.000 --> 3:03:28.000]  and prosecutorial process in America.
[3:03:28.000 --> 3:03:29.000]  That's why you're starting them.
[3:03:29.000 --> 3:03:32.000]  They're using the guise of the Derek Chauvin case
[3:03:32.000 --> 3:03:34.000]  to now take over the Minneapolis police department.
[3:03:34.000 --> 3:03:37.000]  They're using the guise of the Breonna Taylor case
[3:03:37.000 --> 3:03:39.000]  to take over the Louisville police department.
[3:03:39.000 --> 3:03:43.000]  They did this before when they went after the Baltimore police department
[3:03:43.000 --> 3:03:48.000]  and the Chicago police departments under Obama in 2014-2015.
[3:03:48.000 --> 3:03:51.000]  People can go back and look at how that turned out.
[3:03:51.000 --> 3:03:56.000]  Crime skyrocketed, problems rose, corruption expanded,
[3:03:56.000 --> 3:03:59.000]  and civil rights did not improve meaningfully.
[3:03:59.000 --> 3:04:02.000]  So that's part one of what's going on with Chauvin.
[3:04:02.000 --> 3:04:04.000]  The second part of what's going on with Chauvin is,
[3:04:04.000 --> 3:04:08.000]  it turns out, of course, a juror lied to get onto the Chauvin jury,
[3:04:08.000 --> 3:04:13.000]  basically was a BLM activist who was a part of podcasts,
[3:04:13.000 --> 3:04:14.000]  broadcasting his activism,
[3:04:14.000 --> 3:04:17.000]  went to public protest with Floyd family members,
[3:04:17.000 --> 3:04:19.000]  broadcasting his activism,
[3:04:19.000 --> 3:04:21.000]  basically went on afterwards and told people,
[3:04:21.000 --> 3:04:25.000]  it was encouraging people to plant themselves on the trials,
[3:04:25.000 --> 3:04:26.000]  on the jury trials.
[3:04:26.000 --> 3:04:29.000]  This was like a Klan-style tactic from the 1950s
[3:04:29.000 --> 3:04:32.000]  to hide your Klan identity, to sneak onto a trial
[3:04:32.000 --> 3:04:34.000]  to make sure civil rights wouldn't occur
[3:04:34.000 --> 3:04:35.000]  in a lot of high-profile murder cases.
[3:04:35.000 --> 3:04:36.000]  And is that surprising?
[3:04:36.000 --> 3:04:39.000]  The Democrats, literally, the modern incantation,
[3:04:39.000 --> 3:04:42.000]  not the Thomas Jefferson Democrats,
[3:04:42.000 --> 3:04:46.000]  but the ones since 1866 or so, has been the Klan.
[3:04:46.000 --> 3:04:49.000]  The Klan was the governing council, the Democrats,
[3:04:49.000 --> 3:04:51.000]  so we wonder why all their tactics are Klan.
[3:04:51.000 --> 3:04:54.000]  Just now, they're having blacks and minorities do it,
[3:04:54.000 --> 3:04:57.000]  run by actual Klan members who are always racially based
[3:04:57.000 --> 3:04:58.000]  and just wanted power.
[3:04:58.000 --> 3:05:01.000]  We're literally, literally facing the Democratic Party
[3:05:01.000 --> 3:05:03.000]  with KKK tactics.
[3:05:03.000 --> 3:05:04.000]  Exactly.
[3:05:04.000 --> 3:05:06.000]  The Klan was wildly effective.
[3:05:06.000 --> 3:05:08.000]  I mean, the Klan managed to weaponize the mob.
[3:05:08.000 --> 3:05:11.000]  The Klan managed to make basically legal justice
[3:05:11.000 --> 3:05:13.000]  turned into mob justice.
[3:05:13.000 --> 3:05:15.000]  The Klan was able to intimidate voters
[3:05:15.000 --> 3:05:17.000]  and core certain voting patterns.
[3:05:17.000 --> 3:05:19.000]  They're just taking the things they learned
[3:05:19.000 --> 3:05:22.000]  from the Democratic Party's long alignment with
[3:05:22.000 --> 3:05:24.000]  and largely creation of the Klan.
[3:05:24.000 --> 3:05:26.000]  You dig in deep, you find out the Klan
[3:05:26.000 --> 3:05:28.000]  was not an organic, authentic group.
[3:05:28.000 --> 3:05:30.000]  The Klan would rise and fall depending on
[3:05:30.000 --> 3:05:33.000]  what the politicians in power supported them or not.
[3:05:33.000 --> 3:05:37.000]  They were weaponized tools of the establishment infrastructure
[3:05:37.000 --> 3:05:39.000]  local to the community.
[3:05:39.000 --> 3:05:41.000]  They were not some organic group.
[3:05:41.000 --> 3:05:43.000]  That's why, you know, the supposed, you know,
[3:05:43.000 --> 3:05:45.000]  people said Klan made up of poor white people, totally false.
[3:05:45.000 --> 3:05:47.000]  Those poor white people, there would have been
[3:05:47.000 --> 3:05:49.000]  some rich white people hanging from trees.
[3:05:49.000 --> 3:05:50.000]  There weren't.
[3:05:50.000 --> 3:05:53.000]  You've got the outer Klan that is the, you know,
[3:05:53.000 --> 3:05:55.000]  the idiots that they send out to do things.
[3:05:55.000 --> 3:06:00.000]  But this was the rich planners controlling the poor white people
[3:06:00.000 --> 3:06:02.000]  with a gang they were supposedly out of support
[3:06:02.000 --> 3:06:05.000]  that was going to protect them from the blacks.
[3:06:05.000 --> 3:06:06.000]  No, completely.
[3:06:06.000 --> 3:06:09.000]  I mean, all it was indeed Klan actually targeted labor activists.
[3:06:09.000 --> 3:06:12.000]  Klan targeted white sharecroppers and white tenant farmers.
[3:06:12.000 --> 3:06:14.000]  You know, people go back to look.
[3:06:14.000 --> 3:06:16.000]  The majority of poor whites could not vote
[3:06:16.000 --> 3:06:19.000]  in most deep South states from 1896 until 1968
[3:06:19.000 --> 3:06:21.000]  for almost a century.
[3:06:21.000 --> 3:06:23.000]  It wasn't just exclusion of black voters.
[3:06:23.000 --> 3:06:27.000]  There's a reason why Mississippi had fewer voters in 1900 than 1860.
[3:06:27.000 --> 3:06:30.000]  And that wasn't because there were a bunch of slaves voting in 1860.
[3:06:30.000 --> 3:06:32.000]  It was because a lot of poor, almost poor whites
[3:06:32.000 --> 3:06:34.000]  were systematically removed.
[3:06:34.000 --> 3:06:36.000]  You know, Matt McConaughey, a local Austinite,
[3:06:36.000 --> 3:06:38.000]  portrayed that character in the Free State of Jones.
[3:06:38.000 --> 3:06:41.000]  There was a lot of that kind of working class coalition making.
[3:06:41.000 --> 3:06:43.000]  And in order to break that up,
[3:06:43.000 --> 3:06:45.000]  that was also where the Klan was useful.
[3:06:45.000 --> 3:06:48.000]  And the Klan is also a political permission slip
[3:06:48.000 --> 3:06:50.000]  for sociopaths and psychopaths
[3:06:50.000 --> 3:06:52.000]  to act out their criminal pathology.
[3:06:52.000 --> 3:06:55.000]  That's why these guys always have domestic violence records
[3:06:55.000 --> 3:06:56.000]  and criminal records.
[3:06:56.000 --> 3:06:59.000]  And if you look at it, just take the same thing and just shift it.
[3:06:59.000 --> 3:07:00.000]  Put a new name on it.
[3:07:00.000 --> 3:07:02.000]  Instead of Klan, call it Antifa.
[3:07:02.000 --> 3:07:04.000]  Instead of Klan, call it BLM.
[3:07:04.000 --> 3:07:06.000]  Instead of Klan, call it Parts of the Black Panthers
[3:07:06.000 --> 3:07:10.000]  and Militia Movement from the 1960s, 1970s on the left.
[3:07:10.000 --> 3:07:12.000]  Weather Underground, other components.
[3:07:12.000 --> 3:07:13.000]  That's all they're doing.
[3:07:13.000 --> 3:07:15.000]  But the Klan is the most relevant template
[3:07:15.000 --> 3:07:18.000]  because it's almost precisely what Antifa is doing
[3:07:18.000 --> 3:07:20.000]  and partially what BLM is doing.
[3:07:20.000 --> 3:07:22.000]  And they just had their great success in the Chauvin trial.
[3:07:22.000 --> 3:07:23.000]  Exactly.
[3:07:23.000 --> 3:07:24.000]  It's a hidden group,
[3:07:24.000 --> 3:07:26.000]  mainly political, manipulating groups against each other.
[3:07:26.000 --> 3:07:28.000]  And then it's got a paramilitary arm
[3:07:28.000 --> 3:07:30.000]  that goes out and terrorizes people.
[3:07:30.000 --> 3:07:31.000]  That's Antifa.
[3:07:31.000 --> 3:07:34.000]  And Antifa's main funder is a former Nazi collaborator
[3:07:34.000 --> 3:07:36.000]  who actually works with Nazis
[3:07:36.000 --> 3:07:39.000]  to overthrow the hungry leader.
[3:07:39.000 --> 3:07:42.000]  He's trying now and the leader in Ukraine.
[3:07:42.000 --> 3:07:44.000]  I mean, he literally funds Nazis
[3:07:44.000 --> 3:07:46.000]  to overthrow governments,
[3:07:46.000 --> 3:07:49.000]  but because he's Jewish, he's allowed to do it.
[3:07:49.000 --> 3:07:50.000]  It's totally sick.
[3:07:50.000 --> 3:07:51.000]  Completely.
[3:07:51.000 --> 3:07:53.000]  And if people want to look at Antifa,
[3:07:53.000 --> 3:07:56.000]  if Antifa was legitimately an anarchistic group,
[3:07:56.000 --> 3:07:58.000]  a group that was opposed to capitalism,
[3:07:58.000 --> 3:08:01.000]  why have they never attacked the Federal Reserve?
[3:08:01.000 --> 3:08:03.000]  Why do they never attack Wall Street banks?
[3:08:03.000 --> 3:08:04.000]  You know, I mean, the...
[3:08:04.000 --> 3:08:06.000]  Why do you think the mayor suddenly says,
[3:08:06.000 --> 3:08:08.000]  we're going to unmask them, we're going to arrest them,
[3:08:08.000 --> 3:08:10.000]  we're going to convict them?
[3:08:10.000 --> 3:08:13.000]  Why is he finally standing up to Antifa and Portland?
[3:08:13.000 --> 3:08:17.000]  I think all of that is to let the local community
[3:08:17.000 --> 3:08:19.000]  know that he's really in control.
[3:08:19.000 --> 3:08:21.000]  Don't be afraid of Antifa,
[3:08:21.000 --> 3:08:23.000]  because they're really an extension of us.
[3:08:23.000 --> 3:08:25.000]  They're an extension of our political machine.
[3:08:25.000 --> 3:08:26.000]  Sure, so they turn them loose,
[3:08:26.000 --> 3:08:29.000]  and then the government's the savior of their own army.
[3:08:29.000 --> 3:08:30.000]  Exactly.
[3:08:30.000 --> 3:08:32.000]  It's like a pineapple brings the rats,
[3:08:32.000 --> 3:08:34.000]  then he plays the flute, takes the rats away,
[3:08:34.000 --> 3:08:36.000]  you sell out your children to him.
[3:08:36.000 --> 3:08:37.000]  Precisely.
[3:08:37.000 --> 3:08:38.000]  It's exactly the way the Klan worked.
[3:08:38.000 --> 3:08:39.000]  It's exactly the way the Klan functioned.
[3:08:39.000 --> 3:08:41.000]  Remember, repeatedly, there'd be different times
[3:08:41.000 --> 3:08:43.000]  where they would crack down on the Klan.
[3:08:43.000 --> 3:08:45.000]  The reality is, whenever they wanted to unleash
[3:08:45.000 --> 3:08:47.000]  a privatized mob violence,
[3:08:47.000 --> 3:08:50.000]  they would let the Klan get big and grow strong.
[3:08:50.000 --> 3:08:51.000]  Whenever they decided they didn't want that,
[3:08:51.000 --> 3:08:52.000]  they'd pull him back,
[3:08:52.000 --> 3:08:54.000]  then they'd unleash him, then pull him back.
[3:08:54.000 --> 3:08:56.000]  They're just using Antifa in the exact same way.
[3:08:56.000 --> 3:08:58.000]  It shows you how controlled Antifa really is.
[3:08:58.000 --> 3:09:01.000]  These so-called anarchistic radicals.
[3:09:01.000 --> 3:09:03.000]  Nobody would confuse them with the Mali Maguire's
[3:09:03.000 --> 3:09:05.000]  from the late 19th century.
[3:09:05.000 --> 3:09:06.000]  These aren't really...
[3:09:06.000 --> 3:09:07.000]  You know about the Klan,
[3:09:07.000 --> 3:09:09.000]  because some of your earliest stuff as a lawyer
[3:09:09.000 --> 3:09:11.000]  has been fighting them.
[3:09:11.000 --> 3:09:12.000]  It's fascinating history.
[3:09:12.000 --> 3:09:14.000]  We also have the FBI's long history
[3:09:14.000 --> 3:09:16.000]  of working with the Klan as well.
[3:09:16.000 --> 3:09:18.000]  And does anybody doubt that there aren't
[3:09:18.000 --> 3:09:20.000]  major FBI informants as part of all this?
[3:09:20.000 --> 3:09:21.000]  Encouraging it?
[3:09:21.000 --> 3:09:23.000]  I mean, we now know about January 6th
[3:09:23.000 --> 3:09:25.000]  that there were FBI informants all over the place
[3:09:25.000 --> 3:09:27.000]  in key positions, trying to...
[3:09:27.000 --> 3:09:30.000]  Posing as saying they were Q,
[3:09:30.000 --> 3:09:32.000]  manipulating people in there.
[3:09:32.000 --> 3:09:33.000]  Exactly.
[3:09:33.000 --> 3:09:35.000]  One after the other, after the other, after the other.
[3:09:35.000 --> 3:09:38.000]  Key members of Proud Boys, key members of Oathkeep.
[3:09:38.000 --> 3:09:40.000]  All these people that supposedly were independent groups,
[3:09:40.000 --> 3:09:42.000]  the ones that were actually active doing
[3:09:42.000 --> 3:09:45.000]  crazy stuff that day, it turns out disproportionately
[3:09:45.000 --> 3:09:48.000]  were either connected to or were themselves
[3:09:48.000 --> 3:09:50.000]  government informants.
[3:09:50.000 --> 3:09:52.000]  I mean, the so-called head of the Proud Boys
[3:09:52.000 --> 3:09:55.000]  turned out to have a multi-year relationship with them.
[3:09:55.000 --> 3:09:57.000]  People could go back and watch the church committee.
[3:09:57.000 --> 3:10:00.000]  There was a bunch of key Klansmen that were FBI informants.
[3:10:00.000 --> 3:10:02.000]  Some of them were actually FBI agents.
[3:10:02.000 --> 3:10:05.000]  Does anybody doubt the same thing is happening within Tifa?
[3:10:05.000 --> 3:10:07.000]  And why is it the FBI has never figured out who Q is?
[3:10:07.000 --> 3:10:10.000]  Maybe because Q is really part of the FBI at some level?
[3:10:10.000 --> 3:10:12.000]  So, I think...
[3:10:12.000 --> 3:10:14.000]  That's right. You called it before and all happened.
[3:10:14.000 --> 3:10:16.000]  It almost set me and the president up.
[3:10:16.000 --> 3:10:17.000]  We barely got out of it.
[3:10:17.000 --> 3:10:19.000]  What if we ask, hey, pick a time right now.
[3:10:19.000 --> 3:10:21.000]  You're coming back next week for an hour, please.
[3:10:21.000 --> 3:10:22.000]  This is fascinating.
[3:10:22.000 --> 3:10:23.000]  We got 20 seconds.
[3:10:23.000 --> 3:10:25.000]  Tell people about the show you're hosting.
[3:10:25.000 --> 3:10:27.000]  Folks, put his lower third up, please.
[3:10:27.000 --> 3:10:28.000]  Sure.
[3:10:28.000 --> 3:10:30.000]  Yeah, so if people want more information,
[3:10:30.000 --> 3:10:33.000]  they can go to vivavarneslaw.locals.com.
[3:10:33.000 --> 3:10:35.000]  That's where we put up a bunch of a hush-hush episodes
[3:10:35.000 --> 3:10:37.000]  and other things about alternative theories
[3:10:37.000 --> 3:10:38.000]  about the way the world operates.
[3:10:38.000 --> 3:10:40.000]  And I'll be on next Tuesday.
[3:10:40.000 --> 3:10:42.000]  All right. Next Tuesday, you're coming on with us.
[3:10:42.000 --> 3:10:44.000]  We'll be back with your calls, troopers.
[3:10:44.000 --> 3:11:06.000]  Stay with us. I'm Alex Jones, infoawards.com.
[3:11:14.000 --> 3:11:17.000]  People are really, really awake in the establishment.
[3:11:17.000 --> 3:11:19.000]  They don't want to go along with the globalists,
[3:11:19.000 --> 3:11:22.000]  but they're scared. They're looking for leadership.
[3:11:22.000 --> 3:11:24.000]  Well, that's where infoawards comes in.
[3:11:24.000 --> 3:11:26.000]  You fund us. You support infoawards.com.
[3:11:26.000 --> 3:11:28.000]  You get great products at the same time.
[3:11:28.000 --> 3:11:32.000]  We will then go out and do what the globalists say is unpopular,
[3:11:32.000 --> 3:11:35.000]  what the globalists will target you for to show people
[3:11:35.000 --> 3:11:38.000]  that it's safe to tell the truth and to take the heat.
[3:11:38.000 --> 3:11:39.000]  That's our job.
[3:11:39.000 --> 3:11:43.000]  So please keep us on air so we can hit the barbed wire
[3:11:43.000 --> 3:11:46.000]  so we can meet the shock groups and the information war.
[3:11:46.000 --> 3:11:48.000]  Fund us at infoawards.com.
[3:11:48.000 --> 3:11:51.000]  Again, I don't like to lecture people on a very private person,
[3:11:51.000 --> 3:11:54.000]  but because of the globalists and their attack on humanity,
[3:11:54.000 --> 3:11:57.000]  I've been forced the last 27 years to be a public figure,
[3:11:57.000 --> 3:12:00.000]  and we've given the globalists one hell of a run for their money
[3:12:00.000 --> 3:12:01.000]  because of God.
[3:12:01.000 --> 3:12:04.000]  And I know some of our listeners get mad when I talk about God all day,
[3:12:04.000 --> 3:12:07.000]  but just give me a break. The statinism's out in the open.
[3:12:07.000 --> 3:12:10.000]  I've always been a Christian, but now the fact that it's a fight
[3:12:10.000 --> 3:12:12.000]  between good and evil is so clear.
[3:12:12.000 --> 3:12:15.000]  And I get it. A lot of you have been turned off by big churches.
[3:12:15.000 --> 3:12:18.000]  A lot of you have been turned off by the corrupt priest class system,
[3:12:18.000 --> 3:12:21.000]  and I get it, me too. Believe me, I'm one of them.
[3:12:21.000 --> 3:12:25.000]  But it's that relationship with God and just God's universe
[3:12:25.000 --> 3:12:28.000]  that God created that is so essential.
[3:12:28.000 --> 3:12:31.000]  And God created the universe for us to have communion with God
[3:12:31.000 --> 3:12:33.000]  through and to have life.
[3:12:33.000 --> 3:12:35.000]  And so that's what infoawards is really all about.
[3:12:35.000 --> 3:12:37.000]  So thank you all for your word of mouth.
[3:12:37.000 --> 3:12:39.000]  Thank you for spreading the word about infoawards.
[3:12:39.000 --> 3:12:43.000]  Thank you for supporting us to keep us on air by visiting infoawardsstore.com.
[3:12:43.000 --> 3:12:45.000]  Because without your daily and weekly monthly purchases,
[3:12:45.000 --> 3:12:47.000]  we'll be taking off the air.
[3:12:47.000 --> 3:13:10.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here, back live broadcasting worldwide. It's 2.20 central.
[3:13:10.000 --> 3:13:12.000]  I'll be back this Sunday. We're willing.
[3:13:12.000 --> 3:13:16.000]  4 to 8 p.m. I'm gonna do an extra two hours live.
[3:13:16.000 --> 3:13:18.000]  And we're gonna take your calls then.
[3:13:18.000 --> 3:13:21.000]  And the great part about Sunday Live is we only do the local ads.
[3:13:21.000 --> 3:13:24.000]  So it's only like six minutes of ads an hour.
[3:13:24.000 --> 3:13:28.000]  So we'll have a lot of time to take your calls from people who have a view on the vaccine
[3:13:28.000 --> 3:13:30.000]  or have a report about the vaccine.
[3:13:30.000 --> 3:13:32.000]  People love the vaccine. You're welcome to call in.
[3:13:32.000 --> 3:13:35.000]  No one has done that yet, telling me how wonderful it is or how great it is.
[3:13:35.000 --> 3:13:37.000]  All we've seen is death of destruction.
[3:13:37.000 --> 3:13:40.000]  We're taking your phone calls right now. I appreciate everybody holding so long.
[3:13:40.000 --> 3:13:42.000]  I'm gonna take the calls, the order they are received.
[3:13:42.000 --> 3:13:44.000]  I'm gonna move quickly.
[3:13:44.000 --> 3:13:48.000]  And in Georgia, you're on the air. Welcome.
[3:13:48.000 --> 3:13:54.000]  If I want to say, buddy, he's got my wife off of IV-profen 800 for two years now.
[3:13:54.000 --> 3:13:56.000]  So thank you for that product.
[3:13:56.000 --> 3:13:57.000]  Thank you.
[3:13:57.000 --> 3:14:02.000]  And I also have a bone to pick with you about SuperBlue down to my last tube.
[3:14:02.000 --> 3:14:07.000]  I need you to rebrand, maybe bring it back in with Dr. Jones Naturals.
[3:14:07.000 --> 3:14:10.000]  We need it back.
[3:14:10.000 --> 3:14:12.000]  Well, let me tell you what happened with that.
[3:14:12.000 --> 3:14:18.000]  You saw hundreds of articles in the national news saying Alex Jones says he has a cure for coronavirus.
[3:14:18.000 --> 3:14:21.000]  I never said that. It had nothing to do with coronavirus.
[3:14:21.000 --> 3:14:24.000]  The product had been out for like seven years.
[3:14:24.000 --> 3:14:32.000]  But because it had natural silver in it, they were saying I had committed this crime
[3:14:32.000 --> 3:14:37.000]  and they wanted me arrested and they had gone and were trying to get them to do this.
[3:14:37.000 --> 3:14:42.000]  And then they kept saying he won't stop selling it. He won't stop saying it's a cure.
[3:14:42.000 --> 3:14:50.000]  And so basically we stopped selling it just because they wouldn't stop saying it.
[3:14:50.000 --> 3:14:56.000]  And Leticia James, the same way that Senator Buddy into the nursing homes to kill everybody,
[3:14:56.000 --> 3:15:01.000]  she's the same way in investigating herself right now, kept saying she wanted me to be arrested.
[3:15:01.000 --> 3:15:07.000]  And so instead of because, I mean, they were setting it up. Okay.
[3:15:07.000 --> 3:15:09.000]  And I'm not at liberty to get into all of it and break it all down.
[3:15:09.000 --> 3:15:14.000]  But that's an example of how they say you're doing something that you could argue is illegal.
[3:15:14.000 --> 3:15:16.000]  And then saying that you're doing it.
[3:15:16.000 --> 3:15:20.000]  And then they create that perception like he's a white supremacist killing.
[3:15:20.000 --> 3:15:23.000]  You know, like kill Tucker Carlson, you know, and he's not a white supremacist.
[3:15:23.000 --> 3:15:25.000]  Even if he was, he deserved to die.
[3:15:25.000 --> 3:15:30.000]  So that's the type of terrorism goes on with these guys.
[3:15:30.000 --> 3:15:36.000]  I will tell you that an even bestseller was the tooth whitening with the with the and it's the same thing.
[3:15:36.000 --> 3:15:39.000]  I'm running out of mine. No more was produced.
[3:15:39.000 --> 3:15:41.000]  My wife's like, where is it? I want more.
[3:15:41.000 --> 3:15:43.000]  And it's a big bummer.
[3:15:43.000 --> 3:15:47.000]  And, you know, that's just the way it is.
[3:15:47.000 --> 3:15:49.000]  You know, somebody else would just come out and do it themselves.
[3:15:49.000 --> 3:15:54.000]  And, you know, good for them because you got to pick your battles and they were framing me.
[3:15:54.000 --> 3:16:00.000]  And so that's why sometimes you just got to turn loose, you know, at that point.
[3:16:00.000 --> 3:16:07.000]  But I hear you. Hey, our, our activated charcoal is super concentrated, super strong toothpaste.
[3:16:07.000 --> 3:16:09.000]  Folks love it, but let me tell you a little secret.
[3:16:09.000 --> 3:16:12.000]  We do have another toothpaste coming out very, very soon.
[3:16:12.000 --> 3:16:13.000]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[3:16:13.000 --> 3:16:14.000]  So I got to get to all the colors.
[3:16:14.000 --> 3:16:15.000]  Brian, go ahead.
[3:16:15.000 --> 3:16:16.000]  Yes, sir.
[3:16:16.000 --> 3:16:18.000]  So the reason we call it is the vaccines.
[3:16:18.000 --> 3:16:25.000]  Unfortunately, my wife's mother got the first shot of the Moderna and had a period issue.
[3:16:25.000 --> 3:16:27.000]  Went into the hospital.
[3:16:27.000 --> 3:16:31.000]  They thought they'd seen some kind of cancerous thing.
[3:16:31.000 --> 3:16:38.000]  Anyway, it's all the way escalated now to where she's had a full hysterectomy and they're trying to get her on chemo.
[3:16:38.000 --> 3:16:46.000]  And by the way, sir, I'm not laughing at what happened to your mother, but how obvious her mother, how obvious they say, oh, you get a bunch of bleeding.
[3:16:46.000 --> 3:16:51.000]  And even old ladies have their periods come back and it grows a bunch of tumors in your breasts and uterus.
[3:16:51.000 --> 3:16:52.000]  But don't worry.
[3:16:52.000 --> 3:16:53.000]  Ignore those.
[3:16:53.000 --> 3:16:55.000]  Then the doctors take it and it's real cancer.
[3:16:55.000 --> 3:16:57.000]  So again, they're giving people cancer.
[3:16:57.000 --> 3:16:59.000]  Is that not insane?
[3:16:59.000 --> 3:17:01.000]  They didn't even consider it.
[3:17:01.000 --> 3:17:05.000]  I mean, they just went straight into let's go to surgery.
[3:17:05.000 --> 3:17:10.000]  Now they're trying to get her into chemo in case they missed something.
[3:17:10.000 --> 3:17:12.000]  It's out of control.
[3:17:12.000 --> 3:17:20.000]  It works. They give you tumors, which even the God AP, the God Reuters, the God, the New York Times admit these tumors.
[3:17:20.000 --> 3:17:23.000]  So let me ask this question.
[3:17:23.000 --> 3:17:26.000]  Is she listening to you now?
[3:17:26.000 --> 3:17:36.000]  Unfortunately, you know, they're, you know, good country folks that, you know, I've always been the crazy one.
[3:17:36.000 --> 3:17:39.000]  You know, I've listened to you since 2001.
[3:17:39.000 --> 3:17:46.000]  So let me ask you after this, if she was out in Arizona and a rattlesnake better her legs will up, would she say the rattlesnake did it?
[3:17:46.000 --> 3:17:48.000]  Or would she go, I'm a good Christian lady.
[3:17:48.000 --> 3:17:50.000]  I like that diamond back.
[3:17:50.000 --> 3:17:52.000]  I mean, again, no, I've got family the same damn way.
[3:17:52.000 --> 3:17:58.000]  My grandmother said my doctor told me that they gave me polio and he was sorry in the vaccine and I forgave him.
[3:17:58.000 --> 3:18:00.000]  So you stop talking about that on air.
[3:18:00.000 --> 3:18:02.000]  We'll do what we're told.
[3:18:02.000 --> 3:18:03.000]  I mean, it's disgusting.
[3:18:03.000 --> 3:18:04.000]  I love my grandmother.
[3:18:04.000 --> 3:18:05.000]  Damn it.
[3:18:05.000 --> 3:18:07.000]  God, excuse me.
[3:18:07.000 --> 3:18:17.000]  Right now, she's not planning on getting the second dose and my wife is trying to keep her out of, you know, going through chemo.
[3:18:17.000 --> 3:18:21.000]  And she doesn't seem like she's very into that as an option either.
[3:18:21.000 --> 3:18:27.000]  So hopefully, you know, she recovers from this.
[3:18:27.000 --> 3:18:28.000]  I agree, brother.
[3:18:28.000 --> 3:18:31.000]  You should sue the living snot out of the people that did it.
[3:18:31.000 --> 3:18:33.000]  I don't care if they claim vaccine protection.
[3:18:33.000 --> 3:18:39.000]  It's not a vaccine, Nuremberg, because you can bring the literature to your mother-in-law and show her where they admitted.
[3:18:39.000 --> 3:18:40.000]  Oh, don't worry.
[3:18:40.000 --> 3:18:43.000]  You get a bunch of tumors in your uterus and your breast and men get them on their testicles.
[3:18:43.000 --> 3:18:45.000]  Those aren't bad tumors.
[3:18:45.000 --> 3:18:47.000]  But then the doctors go check them in their damn cancer.
[3:18:47.000 --> 3:18:49.000]  They gave her cancer.
[3:18:49.000 --> 3:18:51.000]  They activated that.
[3:18:51.000 --> 3:18:54.000]  Gosh, can you believe that evil brother?
[3:18:54.000 --> 3:18:59.000]  The inserts are blank, so we can't even use that in court.
[3:18:59.000 --> 3:19:00.000]  God bless you.
[3:19:00.000 --> 3:19:01.000]  I appreciate your call.
[3:19:01.000 --> 3:19:03.000]  Yeah, the level of evil is just unbelievable.
[3:19:03.000 --> 3:19:06.000]  It's just so diabolical.
[3:19:06.000 --> 3:19:09.000]  Brian in New York, go ahead.
[3:19:09.000 --> 3:19:10.000]  Hey, Alex.
[3:19:10.000 --> 3:19:12.000]  First, I just want to say thanks for taking my call.
[3:19:12.000 --> 3:19:13.000]  I appreciate it.
[3:19:13.000 --> 3:19:15.000]  I appreciate the work that you do.
[3:19:15.000 --> 3:19:18.000]  You know, to scare you, Alex, this is why they want to kick you off the airways, but we'll keep fighting the good fight.
[3:19:18.000 --> 3:19:19.000]  God bless you.
[3:19:19.000 --> 3:19:20.000]  Thanks.
[3:19:20.000 --> 3:19:21.000]  Well, thank you, brother.
[3:19:21.000 --> 3:19:23.000]  What's your point?
[3:19:23.000 --> 3:19:24.000]  Go ahead.
[3:19:24.000 --> 3:19:30.000]  So, you know, I've taken many medications, vaccines, you know, in my life, but I've never seen one with a problem.
[3:19:30.000 --> 3:19:32.000]  With a propaganda campaign behind it.
[3:19:32.000 --> 3:19:34.000]  And it's kind of scary.
[3:19:34.000 --> 3:19:36.000]  I think we'd be lied to by everyone in charge.
[3:19:36.000 --> 3:19:42.000]  And if you even question anything, you know, I'm sure I know you saw Joe Robe said the other day on the show.
[3:19:42.000 --> 3:19:45.000]  Totally fair-minded, reasonable take on the vaccine.
[3:19:45.000 --> 3:19:46.000]  He was thrown through the mud.
[3:19:46.000 --> 3:19:50.000]  You know, if you dissent at all from the media and from the machine, you're going to be censored.
[3:19:50.000 --> 3:19:51.000]  You're going to be punished.
[3:19:51.000 --> 3:19:54.000]  And I, my question to you, Alex, is how did it get this way?
[3:19:54.000 --> 3:19:56.000]  And what do we do the next few years?
[3:19:56.000 --> 3:19:59.000]  I mean, if people say, well, brother, I mean, it's like termites getting an old barn or an old house.
[3:19:59.000 --> 3:20:03.000]  And the place still looks okay until the wind comes by and blows it over.
[3:20:03.000 --> 3:20:07.000]  And so evil just grows to a point and the bottom falls out.
[3:20:07.000 --> 3:20:12.000]  The bottom is falling out because the general public is in a trained trance.
[3:20:12.000 --> 3:20:17.000]  And so they're so selfish and so normalized that their life.
[3:20:17.000 --> 3:20:20.000]  If you were asleep, you wouldn't care if a spider was biting you.
[3:20:20.000 --> 3:20:22.000]  Well, they're asleep.
[3:20:22.000 --> 3:20:25.000]  And everybody's very childlike and very silly.
[3:20:25.000 --> 3:20:26.000]  People aren't serious.
[3:20:26.000 --> 3:20:29.000]  They don't like to have a responsibility.
[3:20:29.000 --> 3:20:31.000]  And so, and so that's what happens.
[3:20:31.000 --> 3:20:36.000]  And so you got to get them out of the trance and just get in their face, brother.
[3:20:36.000 --> 3:20:41.000]  You know, the mindset is, you know, the government will give us our rights back when the pandemic is over.
[3:20:41.000 --> 3:20:42.000]  And it's just not the case.
[3:20:42.000 --> 3:20:45.000]  It ends when we decided that in it.
[3:20:45.000 --> 3:20:47.000]  Well, that's right. Government never gave us our rights.
[3:20:47.000 --> 3:20:50.000]  We demanded it and had a constitutional right to enshrine it.
[3:20:50.000 --> 3:20:51.000]  Right. God gave us.
[3:20:51.000 --> 3:20:53.000]  Exactly.
[3:20:53.000 --> 3:20:55.000]  Brian, anything else?
[3:20:55.000 --> 3:20:57.000]  No, I want to say thank you again for everything that you do.
[3:20:57.000 --> 3:20:58.000]  Thank you, man.
[3:20:58.000 --> 3:20:59.000]  We're in it together.
[3:20:59.000 --> 3:21:00.000]  All right, start your engines.
[3:21:00.000 --> 3:21:03.000]  When I come back, we've got one, two, three, four, five, six calls.
[3:21:03.000 --> 3:21:06.000]  I will take everyone on the next segment because I got one last segment.
[3:21:06.000 --> 3:21:12.000]  I got to hit the anti-move videos because I got the crew to get me a whole bunch of videos of insanity.
[3:21:12.000 --> 3:21:18.000]  And then from Spain to the US, they are got people at gunpoint.
[3:21:18.000 --> 3:21:24.000]  They're just setting up checkpoints like police screaming and yelling at everybody and just taking over and the police do nothing.
[3:21:24.000 --> 3:21:28.000]  I mean, my God, I pulled to the checkpoint with the anti-varonda pointing guns at me.
[3:21:28.000 --> 3:21:29.000]  That's a deadly weapon.
[3:21:29.000 --> 3:21:30.000]  I'm going to defend myself.
[3:21:30.000 --> 3:21:34.000]  It's better to be tried by nine than carried by six.
[3:21:34.000 --> 3:21:36.000]  And I have no desire to kill Antifa.
[3:21:36.000 --> 3:21:39.000]  They are sacks of methhead devil worship or garbage.
[3:21:39.000 --> 3:21:42.000]  But I'll tell you this, I'm going to defend myself from you sacks of trash.
[3:21:42.000 --> 3:21:44.000]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[3:21:44.000 --> 3:21:45.000]  infowars.com
[3:21:48.000 --> 3:21:53.000]  You know, listeners calling to the show and they thank me and it makes me feel pathetic
[3:21:53.000 --> 3:22:00.000]  because I sit there and I beg you for support constantly for prayer, for financial support and for word of mouth.
[3:22:00.000 --> 3:22:02.000]  And then we're all in this together.
[3:22:02.000 --> 3:22:07.000]  And you know, it gets old having to come to you and say, hey, I got great products, please bomb or we won't be here on air.
[3:22:07.000 --> 3:22:08.000]  But it's true.
[3:22:08.000 --> 3:22:14.000]  We're the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this level that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors.
[3:22:14.000 --> 3:22:16.000]  And they've harassed and almost shut down everybody else.
[3:22:16.000 --> 3:22:18.000]  They crippled all the other groups.
[3:22:18.000 --> 3:22:19.000]  And we're still here.
[3:22:19.000 --> 3:22:23.000]  And as this whole new world order comes out in the open, our credibility is showing up.
[3:22:23.000 --> 3:22:25.000]  That's why we've got to be taken off air.
[3:22:25.000 --> 3:22:27.000]  That's why America has got to be taken down.
[3:22:27.000 --> 3:22:29.000]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved.
[3:22:29.000 --> 3:22:31.000]  And America is still quasi free.
[3:22:31.000 --> 3:22:36.000]  You can't have info wars has been proven right being on air with all the craziness that's about to unfold.
[3:22:36.000 --> 3:22:39.000]  Because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready.

[3:22:53.000 --> 3:22:57.000]  It has been proven that a poor sleep schedule is linked with numerous health problems,
[3:22:57.000 --> 3:23:03.000]  including weight gain, memory issues, mood changes, poor concentration and even a weakened immune system.

[3:23:48.000 --> 3:23:55.000]  Fourteen months ago, I told you that the global lockdown was going to kill tens of millions of people by starvation
[3:23:55.000 --> 3:23:59.000]  and was going to cause a global depression in the first world, and now it has.
[3:23:59.000 --> 3:24:06.000]  It was a no-brainer then that you should get high-quality, storeable food and save it because it is insurance you can eat.
[3:24:06.000 --> 3:24:10.000]  And with all the inflation we knew was coming, that was one way to be inflation.
[3:24:10.000 --> 3:24:13.000]  A lot of you listened, you did a great job. Some of you didn't.
[3:24:13.000 --> 3:24:17.000]  Now is the time to take action before food prices only continue to increase.
[3:24:17.000 --> 3:24:23.000]  Every index shows it. It's basically a guarantee barring a miracle, and we wish it wasn't the case.
[3:24:23.000 --> 3:24:26.000]  But let's make lemonade out of these lemons.
[3:24:26.000 --> 3:24:34.000]  For only a few days more, until next Wednesday, May 12th, you can get 2020 prices still at PrepareWithAlex.com.
[3:24:34.000 --> 3:24:41.000]  And then the prices are going to have to go back to what they were, still lower than most major competitors, and the food is the highest quality you're going to find.

[3:24:48.000 --> 3:24:55.000]  One of the most popular memes on the Internet in the last decade has been, Alex Jones was right.
[3:24:55.000 --> 3:25:04.000]  But it now routinely trends number one on platforms like Twitter and Facebook, making the globalists pull their hair out in anger.
[3:25:04.000 --> 3:25:07.000]  Well, let me tell you, we are Tomorrow's News today, and thanks for your support.
[3:25:07.000 --> 3:25:12.000]  We're still on air at infowars.com and Bandai video radio stations and TV stations across the country.
[3:25:12.000 --> 3:25:19.000]  And our film Endgame, censored and taken offline by Amazon when it hit number one a few years ago, is now available again.
[3:25:19.000 --> 3:25:25.000]  Reprented it with high quality DVD. In HD, it has a zero country code. Anyone in the world is authorized to make copies of it.

[3:25:28.000 --> 3:25:34.000]  Air on local access TV, give it to your pastors, your police chiefs, your state reps, your prime ministers, whatever you do, warn the world.
[3:25:34.000 --> 3:25:39.000]  This film uses their own documents and own statements 14 years ago to expose them.
[3:25:39.000 --> 3:25:49.000]  It's more important than ever, available at infowars.com. That's infowars.com. Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[3:26:09.000 --> 3:26:37.000]  We're definitely in the storm.
[3:26:37.000 --> 3:26:41.000]  We're going to go to your phone calls right now. Really amazing taking these calls.
[3:26:41.000 --> 3:26:44.000]  One person calling him with a good story about the vaccines.
[3:26:44.000 --> 3:26:52.000]  But everywhere else you get censored on Facebook and Twitter and YouTube, nurses, doctors, the people that have gotten sick and will have lost loved ones, tell their stories.
[3:26:52.000 --> 3:26:59.000]  And they say, sorry, it's not allowed. And then the mother of Breonna Taylor, who the cops did accidentally shoot and no, not warrant.
[3:26:59.000 --> 3:27:09.000]  Rand Paul got a law passed to stop it. He got physically attacked for doing it. They kept saying say her name when he's got the past law shows the ignorance of the left brainwash minions.
[3:27:09.000 --> 3:27:21.000]  And even Breonna Taylor's mother says that Black Lives Matter are communists and don't don't help her or anybody else. She got taken off Facebook and block because they own her daughter now.
[3:27:21.000 --> 3:27:25.000]  They use her to cause a race war, not to get justice.
[3:27:25.000 --> 3:27:30.000]  Kate in Kansas. Thanks for holding her on the air. Welcome. You are a nurse. Welcome.
[3:27:30.000 --> 3:27:42.000]  Yes, Alex, I am here to tell you that our health care industry is completely compromised. People need to know that principal people need to speak out, regardless of what the consequences may be.
[3:27:42.000 --> 3:27:55.000]  I have a friend who's a health care and I'm married to a health care administrator. This man knows that this whole thing is fake that these vaccines so called I call them pseudo vaccines are deadly.
[3:27:55.000 --> 3:28:07.000]  And yet he has presided over vaccinating elderly people in a nursing home, preparing these vaccines for people who come into the clinic, keeping the hospital going with vaccinated people.
[3:28:07.000 --> 3:28:18.000]  And I asked his wife, why? And she said, if he doesn't do it, they'll lose their funding. And I said, let him lose it. Close it all down. I'd rather see it closed than these people.
[3:28:18.000 --> 3:28:25.000]  That's right. All it's going to take is the administrators going public because the whole thing's about money. $53,000 for somebody they intubate.
[3:28:25.000 --> 3:28:33.000]  No wonder Cuomo's like, we need ventilators, ventilators because he's being paid off by those groups that came out to do that. Isn't that evil?
[3:28:33.000 --> 3:28:46.000]  It's totally evil and we need to start thinking about how we're going to build an alternative to the so-called health care system. I work in it and I know it's rotten from the inside out and their compromise is made all the time.
[3:28:46.000 --> 3:28:48.000]  And I'm frankly disgusted with it.
[3:28:48.000 --> 3:28:52.000]  What are your colleagues, what are your colleagues saying about all this? Are they saying through it?
[3:28:52.000 --> 3:29:08.000]  You know, Alex, the industry in which I work is so woke. It's all about Kamala Harris' ethics and equality and everybody's got to have the same thing. And it's just tragic.
[3:29:08.000 --> 3:29:15.000]  They're like a bunch of 10-year-old spoiled brats that have all the fake rights they want while their real freedom and their very lives being taken.
[3:29:15.000 --> 3:29:23.000]  It's all fake. It's all fake. So I just don't go along with it. I speak out everywhere. I'm not afraid. I may lose my job over this.
[3:29:23.000 --> 3:29:33.000]  Fortunately, the place I work for is enforcing these pseudo-vaccines and I will never take one and I tell everyone not to. But we've got to build an alternative health care system.
[3:29:33.000 --> 3:29:41.000]  Well, let me tell you what's happening. I should be getting a lot of these names, but Sunday, I'm going to go 4 to 6 p.m. We've already gotten the EMT's name that wanted to say more.
[3:29:41.000 --> 3:29:50.000]  If you've got time on Mother's Day, if you can't understand, if you want to give us your name and number, we won't share it. We'll throw it away, you know, put it on a piece of paper and then throw out the trash and shred it once you're on Sunday.
[3:29:50.000 --> 3:29:59.000]  If you'd like to be on for, you know, five minutes, call you, put you directly on, not hold for an hour. I'd love to have you on to tell us more about that administrator and what they said.
[3:29:59.000 --> 3:30:04.000]  So put her on hold, see if she wants to pop back in. But I've got to get there, everybody. Katie, thank you so much for your testimony.
[3:30:04.000 --> 3:30:10.000]  Okay, up next here, Ginny, thanks for holding. Ian North Carolina, go ahead.
[3:30:10.000 --> 3:30:12.000]  Hey, Alex, how are you doing today?
[3:30:12.000 --> 3:30:16.000]  I'm pretty freaked out. I mean, it's this UT study blows me away.
[3:30:16.000 --> 3:30:27.000]  So am I. And we've got first time caller, but my husband and I long time listeners, Alex, just keep doing the good work because we need you out there, Alex, giving us the information that you give us.
[3:30:27.000 --> 3:30:40.000]  Just want to put a plug in all people that are listening, ultimate krill oil, survival shield, X2, lung cleanser, the pouches for your iPhone, protective eye pouches, electro pure breeze.
[3:30:40.000 --> 3:30:50.000]  I'm just a little bit disappointed. I can't find the super silver gel that you used to sell at one time. But unfortunately, it's not on your info store any longer.
[3:30:50.000 --> 3:30:52.000]  And of course, knockout.
[3:30:52.000 --> 3:30:59.000]  I know, man, the Democrats said that if I sold what's even sold in Walmart, that's sold in Walmart, by the way, so let you know under the official name.
[3:30:59.000 --> 3:31:04.000]  If I sell that they will arrest me. And of course, it's unconstitutional, but I can't do it.
[3:31:04.000 --> 3:31:09.000]  I'm disgusted. I'm totally disgusted with what's going on, Alex, but just let me get to my point.
[3:31:09.000 --> 3:31:24.000]  Four different incidences that I have just heard of. One family member took the shot, the two shots. She's elderly. Just yesterday found out that she was taken to emergency inflammation of the lungs.
[3:31:24.000 --> 3:31:32.000]  But they don't put two and two together, Alex. Another friend in Vegas, her friend took the shot, the Johnson and Johnson.
[3:31:32.000 --> 3:31:42.000]  Next day, she's 19, blood clot. She's in the hospital on a ventilator. Another one, family member, his blood pressure is out of control.
[3:31:42.000 --> 3:31:53.000]  Alex, I can go on and on. I am just so disgusted. My husband and I are so disgusted as to what is happening in our country, in our world, and people need to wake up.
[3:31:53.000 --> 3:31:56.000]  They're like zombies, Alex.
[3:31:56.000 --> 3:32:09.000]  They've been put in a trance and now they're being brain damaged and physically killed. And of course, you can give them the UT study where they said any COVID vaccine attacks proteins in the body and eats holes in the lungs, liver, heart and brain.
[3:32:09.000 --> 3:32:11.000]  Can you believe that?
[3:32:11.000 --> 3:32:26.000]  Yeah, Alex, we sent that pamphlet that you had. We sent it to our legislatures. We did not get a response from no one. I just want to pull my hair out of my head because I am just at a point.
[3:32:26.000 --> 3:32:31.000]  My husband and I are like, wake up. Wake up, people. You are brain dead.
[3:32:31.000 --> 3:32:35.000]  Well, you said it. Just keep fighting and keep praying and keep taking action. God bless you.
[3:32:35.000 --> 3:32:36.000]  We are.
[3:32:36.000 --> 3:32:44.000]  Thank you. Okay. Let's talk to Lynn from North Carolina. Lynn, go ahead.
[3:32:44.000 --> 3:32:54.000]  Alex, thank you for taking my call. I'm calling because my child goes to University of Florida and they got notified that if they don't have the vaccine, they're not allowed to come to work or school.
[3:32:54.000 --> 3:33:03.000]  And they have to do testing every two weeks. And the testing they stand in this line with people that are sick and think they have COVID. They don't separate the well people.
[3:33:03.000 --> 3:33:11.000]  Then they pass around the iPads. Everyone has to sign. And then you're on the app. If you don't go do your tests, then you're not allowed to come into work.
[3:33:11.000 --> 3:33:21.000]  That's right. The colleges are collapsing. There'll be no jobs for most of these things soon. I'm sorry. Education used to be good. I'm not saying you're bad sending them there, but it's all going to fall anyways.
[3:33:21.000 --> 3:33:29.000]  And so some colleges saying you can't leave the campus during your period there. This is cult programming, giant Milgram experiment.
[3:33:29.000 --> 3:33:37.000]  And so A, you can go to a doctor and the doctor can say, oh, you have a history of a larger responses. Here's a letter.
[3:33:37.000 --> 3:33:44.000]  And so you're like, oh, you're going to make me take a shot when I'm not supposed to. There are ways to get around that. They're a guarantee of the faculty is not taking the shots.
[3:33:44.000 --> 3:33:54.000]  They're just hurting you in. And so he can either leave that place or he can simply go get a psychologist to say he has an anxiety issue and get a letter.
[3:33:54.000 --> 3:34:01.000]  Or you can simply give them a Nuremberg code and then they try to take him out, call Robert Barnes. He'll file a lawsuit.
[3:34:01.000 --> 3:34:06.000]  Yes. He's almost done with his PhD, so you hate for him to leave.
[3:34:06.000 --> 3:34:12.000]  Well, see, that's the thing. They're holding him hostage. And here's the deal. Maybe it doesn't hurt him right away. Maybe it never does.
[3:34:12.000 --> 3:34:16.000]  The point is now they're saying you need booster shots for this. And then you've got to still wear your mask.
[3:34:16.000 --> 3:34:24.000]  I mean, our way of life has been destroyed. Until we totally dig out these globalists, things are not going back to normal.
[3:34:24.000 --> 3:34:30.000]  They're in control. They've got a media. We'll do whatever they're told. They've got unlimited money. They want to depopulate us.
[3:34:30.000 --> 3:34:33.000]  This is very sinister.
[3:34:33.000 --> 3:34:39.000]  Sick. And you wonder what they're doing with the bio data. You don't even know who's collecting your spit. They're spitting in these cups and giving your...
[3:34:39.000 --> 3:34:43.000]  You usually have to have a warrant to take somebody's spit like that.
[3:34:43.000 --> 3:34:49.000]  Well, they're also got lots of special vaccine lots that used to the military. They're doing testing.
[3:34:49.000 --> 3:34:55.000]  You better know these universities are giving experimental shots to these guys and then bringing them through every two weeks.
[3:34:55.000 --> 3:35:03.000]  So this is medical experimentation. And why not? They're announcing the new booster shots are going to be patches with microglass that goes into your skin so they can track you.
[3:35:03.000 --> 3:35:05.000]  Did you know that?
[3:35:05.000 --> 3:35:13.000]  No, but I mean, I believe anything now and I just I protected my child my whole life and now, you know, there's nothing I can do.
[3:35:13.000 --> 3:35:16.000]  Either you walk out and leave your degree.
[3:35:16.000 --> 3:35:24.000]  Listen, he can leave a student group against it saying he has rights instead of leaving. He should leave a group against it and they'll quietly call him in and say, we're going to give you a waiver.
[3:35:24.000 --> 3:35:29.000]  And then he'll know how evil it is and you won't want to stop. He'll need to lead a movement against them.
[3:35:29.000 --> 3:35:37.000]  The other is if you get attacked, you lay down your crush. If you get attacked and you fight back, you get stronger each time. You understand?
[3:35:37.000 --> 3:35:46.000]  Should have put in the executive order that he banned he banned mandatory vaccines, but he didn't ban coercion to take the vaccine and this is coercion. It's forced.
[3:35:46.000 --> 3:35:48.000]  That's right. It's called bullying.
[3:35:48.000 --> 3:35:55.000]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful products ever made, alpha power.

[3:37:16.000 --> 3:37:22.000]  Not because you've done something wrong, but because the big telecoms, big tech and the globalist are predatory and are evil.
[3:37:22.000 --> 3:37:28.000]  And in the surveillance state, we need to more and more start doing everything we can to mitigate the criminal activity they're involved in.
[3:37:28.000 --> 3:37:35.000]  These are the highest quality, highest ratings. They're available at infowarstore.com in four different colors and they are only $19.95.
[3:37:35.000 --> 3:37:43.000]  The exact same pocket is sold for $24.95 or even $29.95 everywhere. They're available right now for $19.95 and they fund the InfoWars.
[3:37:43.000 --> 3:37:47.000]  Please take action today. Protect your privacy and fund the InfoWars.
[3:37:47.000 --> 3:37:58.000]  Listeners have rightfully been complaining the last six months or so saying, where are most of the best selling products you have that we love?
[3:37:58.000 --> 3:38:04.000]  And my answer is the supply chain has broken down. I have to either reformulate or I have to lower the quality to get a lot of these.
[3:38:04.000 --> 3:38:11.000]  And so that's why we don't have a lot of products in. That's why InfoWars is in financial trouble is because if we had the product, you would be buying it.
[3:38:11.000 --> 3:38:19.000]  It's a lot of money, but so many of them have been sold out. Just like you noticed, a lot of other items at the store aren't available because civilization is being artificially imploded.
[3:38:19.000 --> 3:38:27.000]  But finally, X2 is back in stock with a good halogen, deep earth crystal iodine, so essential in your body. It's really the missing link.
[3:38:27.000 --> 3:38:32.000]  It's 50% off. We've got a big shipment of it at infowarstore.com.
[3:38:32.000 --> 3:38:38.000]  Now when it gets ready to sell out, we'll have to go back to near full price, take advantage of this now, stock up and don't forget to take your X2.
[3:38:38.000 --> 3:38:42.000]  Because I have a tendency to forget how great it is and not take it myself.
[3:38:42.000 --> 3:38:48.000]  But when I do, stamina, libido, energy weight loss, it's incredible. It's essential. It's X2 at infowarstore.com.
[3:38:48.000 --> 3:38:55.000]  14 months ago, I began to sit on the broadcast every day when the first world collapses, the third world dies.
[3:38:55.000 --> 3:39:07.000]  We have such a complex civilization with so many billions of moving parts that when you shut down the first world, it causes a chain reaction that will devastate the third world and really hurt the first world.
[3:39:07.000 --> 3:39:10.000]  Well, now you're hearing about gas shortages all over the United States.
[3:39:10.000 --> 3:39:17.000]  And that's because the companies and the systems and the drivers that could barely get the job done before delivering gas had been shut down.
[3:39:17.000 --> 3:39:24.000]  Plus, the Keystone Pipeline's been shut down along with other pipelines. The left is now blowing up dams across the U.S.
[3:39:24.000 --> 3:39:27.000]  We're being shut down. Our coal power plants are off as well.
[3:39:27.000 --> 3:39:30.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, prepare to be a total slave.
[3:39:30.000 --> 3:39:33.000]  The third world is imploding as well. The borders have been removed.
[3:39:33.000 --> 3:39:38.000]  So you wake up and this is a globalist chai-com takeover. Gregory said, you have no hope.
[3:39:38.000 --> 3:39:43.000]  They're announcing that there will be less than two-thirds of the gas needed this summer.
[3:39:43.000 --> 3:40:06.000]  They told you that you're under lockdown one way or another and CNN laughed at you and your family.
[3:40:13.000 --> 3:40:23.000]  The smell of gas surrounds you.
[3:40:23.000 --> 3:40:32.000]  Look, the globalists see the public not working hard, the public being slovenly, the public being ugly.
[3:40:32.000 --> 3:40:37.000]  I'm pretty ugly compared to my ancestors. We're just not hard people like they were.
[3:40:37.000 --> 3:40:41.000]  And we also eat all this poison GMO. And they're just slowly poisoning all of us.
[3:40:41.000 --> 3:40:48.000]  And their idea is, if you don't know this and you don't mediate it and you don't get around it, you deserve to die.
[3:40:48.000 --> 3:40:55.000]  And I really wanted to spend a half hour today on the anti-fovideos of them acting like police and attacking everybody and going crazy.
[3:40:55.000 --> 3:40:58.000]  And I'll try to play a few of the clips, but I'll just have to.
[3:40:58.000 --> 3:41:03.000]  I'll have to do it on the Sunday show, but I said four hours of your calls with your stories.
[3:41:03.000 --> 3:41:07.000]  And I've been doing a pretty good job lately of getting to these calls because they don't want this heard.
[3:41:07.000 --> 3:41:19.000]  They don't want this shut down. But again, they're collapsing the economy and they're going to use a race war as the cover for the collapse and then blame that on the race war and the deal to the American people.
[3:41:19.000 --> 3:41:25.000]  So the bench don't get blamed. That's the big one ties together with the COVID. That's a drill for martial law.
[3:41:25.000 --> 3:41:28.000]  But your calls actually are paramount above that.
[3:41:28.000 --> 3:41:31.000]  If I have the energy, I'm actually pretty exhausted right now for four hours.
[3:41:31.000 --> 3:41:37.000]  I think about an hour off to do some, you know, research. I call that off, not talking before I go back on there.
[3:41:37.000 --> 3:41:40.000]  Maybe I'll pop in during the war room today. It's coming up here in about eight, nine minutes.
[3:41:40.000 --> 3:41:44.000]  With Owen Schroyer. I know he's had a big Friday show. The bunch of guests and calls lined up for you.
[3:41:44.000 --> 3:41:47.000]  They're on the Info Wars Network. Only way we reach new people is you sharing the links.
[3:41:47.000 --> 3:41:50.000]  So again, I thank you all. This is a war, as you now know.
[3:41:50.000 --> 3:41:52.000]  But I want to finish up with James Russell and Daniel.
[3:41:52.000 --> 3:41:57.000]  Then I'll play a few of those clips and we have time that I mentioned the Vandifa, but they're all over the place. It's just insane.
[3:41:57.000 --> 3:42:02.000]  They just normalize us with the cops standing there while they're coming to cars, pointing guns at people.
[3:42:02.000 --> 3:42:04.000]  Get out of your car and beating people up.
[3:42:04.000 --> 3:42:08.000]  And they sound like, you know, what the left says are bad cops.
[3:42:08.000 --> 3:42:11.000]  I mean, it's just because they want to be the cops.
[3:42:11.000 --> 3:42:16.000]  They're like pretending and larping. They're like a SWAT team stopping a bank robber.
[3:42:16.000 --> 3:42:19.000]  But they're not. They're just beating people up and attacking people.
[3:42:19.000 --> 3:42:25.000]  I mean, I just, I couldn't be a cop around these people.
[3:42:25.000 --> 3:42:29.000]  I mean, it's just, it's just incredible. And they go, don't attack us while they attack you.
[3:42:29.000 --> 3:42:32.000]  The left is just trash.
[3:42:32.000 --> 3:42:36.000]  And I'm sorry, man. I love it with the metal baton. They start attacking them.
[3:42:36.000 --> 3:42:39.000]  We're going to slit your throat, all this stuff.
[3:42:39.000 --> 3:42:42.000]  I mean, it's just who they are, man. They love it.
[3:42:42.000 --> 3:42:46.000]  I see, I can't get around that. I'd go, I'd go King Kong on those people.
[3:42:46.000 --> 3:42:48.000]  I mean, I'm telling you to be bad, man.
[3:42:48.000 --> 3:42:51.000]  I'm not saying I'm the toughest guy around, but I got a real problem.
[3:42:51.000 --> 3:42:55.000]  You want to punch my buttons, be five or six people saying you're going to kick my ass.
[3:42:55.000 --> 3:42:59.000]  That, that punches the buttons, man. That overwhelming grip people.
[3:42:59.000 --> 3:43:03.000]  That's when the big can of crazy man gets released.
[3:43:03.000 --> 3:43:05.000]  And that's when people start getting hurt really bad.
[3:43:05.000 --> 3:43:08.000]  I mean, I even looking at it, I just, oh my God.
[3:43:08.000 --> 3:43:12.000]  I mean, those people would have their noses torn off, their heads bashed in,
[3:43:12.000 --> 3:43:15.000]  and then, you know, somebody by walk up and stab me from behind.
[3:43:15.000 --> 3:43:18.000]  I don't even care because I just destroy each person one at a time.
[3:43:18.000 --> 3:43:21.000]  It only takes about five seconds. You actually get a hold of it.
[3:43:21.000 --> 3:43:24.000]  By the way, anybody can do this. Anybody can kill really easy.
[3:43:24.000 --> 3:43:26.000]  People have governors. I don't have one.
[3:43:26.000 --> 3:43:29.000]  And five or six people sort of fight with me even though I'm 47. I'm just young.
[3:43:29.000 --> 3:43:31.000]  I just want to, I want to tear them to pieces.
[3:43:31.000 --> 3:43:33.000]  And I know a lot of you have that in you too.
[3:43:33.000 --> 3:43:38.000]  And the left doesn't get that that whole veneer is starting to peel away, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:43:38.000 --> 3:43:41.000]  So I don't have a governor.
[3:43:41.000 --> 3:43:47.000]  And, man, we all have that instinct when a larger group than us is there.
[3:43:47.000 --> 3:43:50.000]  See the runaway or fight and me, I fight forward.
[3:43:50.000 --> 3:43:53.000]  And that's why this is so dangerous. They're really trying to start a civil war.
[3:43:53.000 --> 3:43:56.000]  All right, shut up, Jones. God, you're a loudmouth.
[3:43:56.000 --> 3:43:59.000]  Daniel in Texas. Go ahead. You're on the air.
[3:43:59.000 --> 3:44:03.000]  Yes, sir. I just had two questions.
[3:44:03.000 --> 3:44:10.000]  One, I was going to see if you could like hold a call in prayer session show,
[3:44:10.000 --> 3:44:16.000]  like a segment hour for like on Sunday or Sunday night or something.
[3:44:16.000 --> 3:44:18.000]  I think that's really smart.
[3:44:18.000 --> 3:44:22.000]  Beyond that, people tell their testimony and talk about God and talk about how we need God.
[3:44:22.000 --> 3:44:25.000]  I don't think that's an hour of a show.
[3:44:25.000 --> 3:44:31.000]  I'll do the next Sunday or a special show next week dedicated to God. You're right.
[3:44:31.000 --> 3:44:33.000]  All right. Thank you. Thank you.
[3:44:33.000 --> 3:44:38.000]  Yeah, because on October 12th, 2016, you prayed for Trump to win and I prayed right along with you.
[3:44:38.000 --> 3:44:40.000]  And I think that granted the prayer.
[3:44:40.000 --> 3:44:43.000]  But the reason I was calling in was because my brother took,
[3:44:43.000 --> 3:44:52.000]  he's a physician's assistant and the physician and basically owns the little thing and basically made him take the COVID shot.
[3:44:52.000 --> 3:45:00.000]  And I was wondering, can an employee take his employer to a small claims court?
[3:45:00.000 --> 3:45:07.000]  Yes, it's very immoral to try to make somebody take something experimental that's not even approved.
[3:45:07.000 --> 3:45:15.000]  And so that's slavery when that person wants to rape you and put something in your body so that they say you're clean.
[3:45:15.000 --> 3:45:19.000]  What a cult where you're in a cult where they don't just brand you like Nexium,
[3:45:19.000 --> 3:45:26.000]  but they put GMO in you to show, I mean, it's crazy.
[3:45:26.000 --> 3:45:28.000]  Right, right.
[3:45:28.000 --> 3:45:33.000]  I mean, think about, you know, if you're married, your wife, you know, does if she wants to have a baby or not.
[3:45:33.000 --> 3:45:34.000]  Sorry, go ahead.
[3:45:34.000 --> 3:45:39.000]  I was going to say, could you cite this Nuremberg trials and make them back down like if an employer?
[3:45:39.000 --> 3:45:43.000]  Yeah, I would just say, I don't want any trouble, but absolutely.
[3:45:43.000 --> 3:45:45.000]  You'll just say, hey, I take my vitamins.
[3:45:45.000 --> 3:45:47.000]  I'm not, you know, the vaccine doesn't even protect you.
[3:45:47.000 --> 3:45:49.000]  This is a fraud. Bill Gates is going to jail.
[3:45:49.000 --> 3:45:51.000]  But people don't even push back.
[3:45:51.000 --> 3:45:52.000]  You got to push back Daniel.
[3:45:52.000 --> 3:45:53.000]  Thanks for the call.
[3:45:53.000 --> 3:45:56.000]  All right, let's go ahead and take a call from James and Iowa.
[3:45:56.000 --> 3:45:57.000]  James are on the air.
[3:45:57.000 --> 3:45:58.000]  Go ahead.
[3:45:58.000 --> 3:46:00.000]  Hey, Alex, I called yesterday.
[3:46:00.000 --> 3:46:05.000]  I was the one that called about my sister breastfeeding her baby and all that fun stuff.
[3:46:05.000 --> 3:46:07.000]  And the baby having the convulsions?
[3:46:07.000 --> 3:46:08.000]  Yes.
[3:46:08.000 --> 3:46:13.000]  So early today, I was catching up on other podcasts I was listening to.
[3:46:13.000 --> 3:46:15.000]  I listened to Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[3:46:15.000 --> 3:46:18.000]  And he was covering this document from John Hopkins.
[3:46:18.000 --> 3:46:23.000]  It's called technologies to address global catastrophic biological risk.
[3:46:23.000 --> 3:46:26.000]  I don't know if your crew can pull it up for you.
[3:46:26.000 --> 3:46:30.000]  Yeah, I actually saw an article on that to say the name of it.
[3:46:30.000 --> 3:46:31.000]  Strategies to say it again.
[3:46:31.000 --> 3:46:37.000]  Technology to address global catastrophic biological risk.
[3:46:37.000 --> 3:46:39.000]  All right, tell me more.
[3:46:39.000 --> 3:46:48.000]  And basically it addresses how they can basically course vaccinate the entire population.
[3:46:48.000 --> 3:46:54.000]  They talk about 3D printing proteins and chemicals and biologics.
[3:46:54.000 --> 3:46:59.000]  They talk about how they can use drones to basically monitor the crops.
[3:46:59.000 --> 3:47:04.000]  And if there's certain insects or something in there, they can...
[3:47:04.000 --> 3:47:07.000]  Yeah, it's a total robot takeover of everything.
[3:47:07.000 --> 3:47:11.000]  But first they've got to collapse and sabotage human civilization
[3:47:11.000 --> 3:47:15.000]  so that we have to be saved by the robots and by the technocracy.
[3:47:15.000 --> 3:47:21.000]  And before Jeff Bezos can have 100 story towers that drones fly out of delivering us everything
[3:47:21.000 --> 3:47:23.000]  and we're locked in our houses.
[3:47:23.000 --> 3:47:25.000]  They have to collapse things first.
[3:47:25.000 --> 3:47:27.000]  And they even talk about...
[3:47:27.000 --> 3:47:35.000]  In this document they talk about self-spreading vaccines, self-applying mRNA vaccines,
[3:47:35.000 --> 3:47:40.000]  drone delivery locations so they can use drones to deliver these.
[3:47:40.000 --> 3:47:42.000]  Oh my gosh, we've got an Italy bio weapon out.
[3:47:42.000 --> 3:47:43.000]  You've got to stay in your homes.
[3:47:43.000 --> 3:47:44.000]  The drones are coming.
[3:47:44.000 --> 3:47:46.000]  They haven't touched humans.
[3:47:46.000 --> 3:47:47.000]  They're safe.
[3:47:47.000 --> 3:47:48.000]  It's all been wargamed.
[3:47:48.000 --> 3:47:49.000]  It's all in Clauswap's documents.
[3:47:49.000 --> 3:47:51.000]  Say that again because the crew hasn't pulled it up yet.
[3:47:51.000 --> 3:47:52.000]  I'm sure Mike Adams wrote an article about it.
[3:47:52.000 --> 3:47:53.000]  I don't know why I saw an article about it.
[3:47:53.000 --> 3:47:55.000]  I think it's from here yesterday.
[3:47:55.000 --> 3:47:56.000]  Tell us the headline again.
[3:47:56.000 --> 3:47:59.000]  Technology to address.
[3:47:59.000 --> 3:48:01.000]  Technologies to address.
[3:48:01.000 --> 3:48:03.000]  Global catastrophic.
[3:48:03.000 --> 3:48:05.000]  Global catastrophic.
[3:48:05.000 --> 3:48:07.000]  Biological risk.
[3:48:07.000 --> 3:48:08.000]  Biological risk.
[3:48:08.000 --> 3:48:09.000]  Thanks for the call.
[3:48:09.000 --> 3:48:11.000]  We'll look into that and do something on it.
[3:48:11.000 --> 3:48:13.000]  All right, Russell in California.
[3:48:13.000 --> 3:48:14.000]  You're on the air.
[3:48:14.000 --> 3:48:17.000]  Hey Alex, thank you for taking my call.
[3:48:17.000 --> 3:48:21.000]  Hey, I have a lot of healthcare professionals in my family
[3:48:21.000 --> 3:48:24.000]  and one of the things that scares them the most
[3:48:24.000 --> 3:48:30.000]  is that there is a possibility that we're training our blood supply.
[3:48:30.000 --> 3:48:37.000]  What's the possibility of people who've been given the RNA vaccine
[3:48:37.000 --> 3:48:41.000]  being denied the ability to donate blood?
[3:48:41.000 --> 3:48:46.000]  What happens when you need blood transfusions and your RNA
[3:48:46.000 --> 3:48:49.000]  and you have two different blood types that you're submitting
[3:48:49.000 --> 3:48:52.000]  to have RNA factors from the vaccine?
[3:48:52.000 --> 3:48:53.000]  Well, that's right.
[3:48:53.000 --> 3:48:55.000]  They're contaminating the entire planet.
[3:48:55.000 --> 3:48:56.000]  They're destroying everything.
[3:48:56.000 --> 3:48:58.000]  They're not just GMOing the crops now.
[3:48:58.000 --> 3:49:01.000]  They don't record cause deformities and mutations in lab animals.
[3:49:01.000 --> 3:49:03.000]  They're now frankenfruiting us.
[3:49:03.000 --> 3:49:06.000]  I mean, this is just a devastating weapons salvo
[3:49:06.000 --> 3:49:09.000]  and it's an opening salvo and it's a strong salvo.
[3:49:09.000 --> 3:49:13.000]  No consent, no record, no what it is, cover up of the deaths.
[3:49:13.000 --> 3:49:16.000]  I mean, this is a devastating attack.
