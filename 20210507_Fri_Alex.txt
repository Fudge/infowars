[00:00:39.332 --> 00:00:42.675]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is a very important transmission.
[00:00:42.675 --> 00:00:45.778]  We are very, very honored to have you here joining us.
[00:00:45.778 --> 00:00:55.166]  We're going to be broadcasting for the next four hours on this very important transmission.
[00:00:55.166 --> 00:01:03.513]  I've got news of such massive import that we're just going to go to the special report here in a moment and then come back and launch all of this.
[00:01:04.477 --> 00:01:09.981]  More information a day is coming out now about how deadly these Franken-shots are than came out in the previous six months.
[00:01:09.981 --> 00:01:11.842]  A real quickening is here.
[00:01:11.842 --> 00:01:16.365]  They've activated anti-fa-terror groups all over the world, not just here.
[00:01:16.365 --> 00:01:21.869]  Massive inflation is now proven to be coming and to be intensifying.
[00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:22.789]  And so much more.
[00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:26.632]  But if we're aware of the enemy attacks, and if we reach out to each other, we can stop it.
[00:01:27.276 --> 00:01:34.494]  Here is Darren McBrain's latest report on the incredible Thought Police launching total tyranny here in the U.S.
[00:01:34.494 --> 00:01:35.156]  and across the world.
[00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.212]  And now to the growing number of hoaxes popping up online.
[00:01:39.212 --> 00:01:41.113]  Misinformation is spreading fast.
[00:01:41.113 --> 00:01:44.795]  The coronavirus has created a perfect storm for conspiracy theories.
[00:01:44.795 --> 00:01:48.117]  If you go online, there's no shortage of conspiracy theories.
[00:01:48.117 --> 00:01:52.199]  There have been a growing number of anti-vaccination conspiracy theories online.
[00:01:52.199 --> 00:01:55.000]  There's been a wave of myths and disinformation.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.963]  The internet has lit up with misinformation spreading nearly as fast as the virus itself.
[00:02:00.223 --> 00:02:06.265]  Religious-based conspiracy theories surrounding the vaccinations are exploding on social media.
[00:02:06.265 --> 00:02:11.647]  Wasn't Facebook supposed to take care of anti-vaxxer kind of groups before COVID-19?
[00:02:11.647 --> 00:02:14.668]  Why is this still popping up and where's it coming from?
[00:02:14.668 --> 00:02:18.629]  Why is this type of information so difficult to police?
[00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:31.420]  In general, what we found in a bunch of studies is that most of the people who believe false news stories do so because they're just not thinking deeply about whether what they're reading is true or false.
[00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:39.128]  Social media platforms have been able to ban a lot of this content, but it's become increasingly more difficult to enforce.
[00:02:39.858 --> 00:02:43.224]  I know internet companies are looking at this.
[00:02:43.224 --> 00:02:48.573]  Do you wish that they would play a role in taking stuff down which is demonstrably false?
[00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.571]  Yeah, in some cases they are taking things down.
[00:02:53.571 --> 00:02:56.293]  We're hunting for COVID conspiracy theories.
[00:02:56.293 --> 00:03:00.034]  We report over 800 pieces of misinformation.
[00:03:00.034 --> 00:03:07.698]  It's stuff that's sort of on the cusp, like conspiracy theories that could spread sort of propaganda or maybe harmful health misinformation.
[00:03:07.698 --> 00:03:15.042]  If you're a healthy person and you're exercising all the time and you're young and you're eating well, I don't think you need to worry about this.
[00:03:15.042 --> 00:03:17.002]  Dangerous misinformation.
[00:03:17.002 --> 00:03:17.783]  Let's report it.
[00:03:18.383 --> 00:03:22.808]  A video making the same false claim was widely circulated on Facebook.
[00:03:22.808 --> 00:03:25.511]  It was tagged with the fact check that it's false.
[00:03:25.511 --> 00:03:28.094]  Vaccines are inherently dangerous.
[00:03:28.094 --> 00:03:28.575]  Flag it.
[00:03:28.575 --> 00:03:30.037]  False information.
[00:03:30.037 --> 00:03:31.258]  I'm going to report this.
[00:03:31.258 --> 00:03:32.459]  You know it's false.
[00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:33.060]  It's false, yeah.
[00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:40.229]  And as bad as the globalist censorship is, and as much as they've been suppressing thousands of medical doctors and nurses here in the U.S.
[00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:44.715]  alone, not to mention around the world, the truth about COVID-19 is coming out.
[00:03:44.715 --> 00:03:48.020]  The truth about the vaccines not being vaccines, not protecting you, is coming out.
[00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.403]  The truth about the PCR test being fake is coming out.
[00:03:50.403 --> 00:03:52.986]  The truth about Bill Gates being behind all the companies is coming out.
[00:03:52.986 --> 00:04:04.081]  The fact that the Pfizer and the Moderna and the AstraZeneca and the Australian government vaccine and a whole bunch of others have been banned in Australia and South Africa and 21 countries in Europe and the Philippines and Russia.
[00:04:04.722 --> 00:04:10.750]  There is absolutely no evidence or credible studies supporting any of what he just said.
[00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.274]  I know my husband is not backstabbing people and putting a microchip in their arm.
[00:04:14.274 --> 00:04:18.178]  That technology doesn't even exist and he's never uttered the words out of his mouth, so...
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.702]  Forget the conspiracy.
[00:04:21.702 --> 00:04:23.443]  Listen to our government agencies.
[00:04:23.443 --> 00:04:24.604]  These guys are telling the truth.
[00:04:24.604 --> 00:04:27.006]  You know, there's no conspiracy here, folks.
[00:04:27.006 --> 00:04:29.308]  Just get your damn vaccine.
[00:04:29.308 --> 00:04:31.950]  I'm not asking what's in the infusion.
[00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:37.234]  I'm not looking up all of the ingredients in the infusion.
[00:04:37.234 --> 00:04:40.757]  I am sticking out my arm and I am taking the infusion.
[00:04:42.091 --> 00:04:44.352]  We've got to shun folks.
[00:04:44.352 --> 00:04:47.694]  We've got to shun people into getting vaccinated.
[00:04:47.694 --> 00:04:51.136]  We need to shun those that refuse to get vaccinated.
[00:04:51.136 --> 00:04:53.577]  We must take the vaccine.
[00:04:53.577 --> 00:04:57.059]  Put them on a bus and bring them to a mass vaccination site.
[00:04:58.354 --> 00:05:07.036]  Listeners have rightfully been complaining the last six months or so saying, where are most of the best-selling products you have that we love?
[00:05:07.036 --> 00:05:09.917]  And my answer is the supply chain has broken down.
[00:05:09.917 --> 00:05:13.558]  I have to either reformulate or I have to lower the quality to get a lot of these.
[00:05:13.558 --> 00:05:15.958]  And so that's why we don't have a lot of products in.
[00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:20.199]  That's why InfoWars is in financial trouble is because if we had the product, you would be buying it.
[00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:21.300]  We have the money.
[00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.860]  But so many of them have been sold out.
[00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:28.803]  Just like you noticed, a lot of other items at the store aren't available because civilization is being artificially imploded.
[00:05:28.803 --> 00:05:37.427]  But, finally, X2 is back in stock with a good halogen, deep-earth crystal iodide, so essential in your body, it's really the missing link.
[00:05:37.427 --> 00:05:38.248]  It's 50% off.
[00:05:38.248 --> 00:05:41.389]  We've got a big shipment of it at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:44.171]  Now, when it gets ready to sell out, we'll have to go back to near full price.
[00:05:44.631 --> 00:05:45.852]  Take advantage of this now.
[00:05:45.852 --> 00:05:46.432]  Stock up.
[00:05:46.432 --> 00:05:47.513]  And don't forget to take your X2.
[00:05:47.513 --> 00:05:51.495]  Because I have a tendency to forget how great it is and not take it myself.
[00:05:51.495 --> 00:05:55.217]  But when I do, stamina, libido, energy, weight loss, it's incredible.
[00:05:55.217 --> 00:05:56.077]  It's essential.
[00:05:56.077 --> 00:05:56.737]  It's X2 at m4store.com.
[00:06:13.533 --> 00:06:14.654]  InfoWars.
[00:06:14.654 --> 00:06:16.956]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:06:16.956 --> 00:06:21.480]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:40.191 --> 00:06:41.893]  It's Friday, May 7th.
[00:06:41.893 --> 00:06:44.155]  The year is 2021.
[00:06:44.155 --> 00:06:45.296]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:06:45.296 --> 00:06:48.759]  I'm going to be hosting all four hours of my broadcast today.
[00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:52.202]  And The War Room with Owen Schroyer is coming up 3 p.m.
[00:06:52.202 --> 00:06:52.883]  Central.
[00:06:52.883 --> 00:06:54.004]  I'll be back this Sunday.
[00:06:54.975 --> 00:07:06.446]  I'm going to host the Alex Jones Sunday Show that I've been doing for 15 years, and then I'm going to host a Sunday Live that Owen's been doing for the last six months or so until 8 o'clock.
[00:07:06.446 --> 00:07:13.733]  So I'll do four hours of live radio, and we're going to open the phones up the entire time and take calls.
[00:07:14.335 --> 00:07:26.684]  For the general public to tell their stories of what happened when they took the vaccine, or their family took it, or if you're a nursing home worker, or a doctor, or a nurse, or a lawyer representing people.
[00:07:26.684 --> 00:07:36.712]  You really need a place to speak, because you're being censored, you're being blocked, you're being silenced all over the world, not just here.
[00:07:36.712 --> 00:07:42.276]  And then, we've done a lot of preparation for this, I'm going to do the best job I can.
[00:07:42.276 --> 00:07:42.857]  Next hour,
[00:07:45.658 --> 00:07:49.759]  We have Antifa attacks in Madrid, Spain.
[00:07:49.759 --> 00:07:52.460]  Antifa attacks in the United Kingdom.
[00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:54.741]  Antifa attacks in New York.
[00:07:54.741 --> 00:07:57.122]  Antifa attacks in Florida.
[00:07:57.122 --> 00:08:05.105]  Antifa attacks in Portland, Oregon, Seattle, Washington, San Diego, California.
[00:08:05.105 --> 00:08:10.386]  Brutal video in Portland of hundreds of Antifa with M4
[00:08:15.828 --> 00:08:33.440]  Rifles, coming up and pointing guns at people in their cars, saying, I'll shoot you, I'll kill you, robbing their cars, and beating people up, and the police do absolutely nothing.
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.161]  This is Bolshevik level.
[00:08:35.161 --> 00:08:42.926]  They pull the man out, they beat him up, they attack people in front of a school bus, and the police do nothing.
[00:08:43.926 --> 00:08:45.007]  So, there you go.
[00:08:45.007 --> 00:08:47.369]  The police are a political organization in this country.
[00:08:47.369 --> 00:08:49.691]  They're nothing but the largest street gang in the country.
[00:08:49.691 --> 00:08:53.594]  And when they work for us in the Bill of Rights and Constitution, they can be a positive force.
[00:08:53.594 --> 00:08:59.979]  But in most places, like Guatemala, or Cuba, or North Korea, or China, we know the police are bad, right?
[00:08:59.979 --> 00:09:01.581]  They are!
[00:09:01.581 --> 00:09:03.122]  They're authoritarians.
[00:09:03.122 --> 00:09:05.564]  So just like that, it's who controls them.
[00:09:05.564 --> 00:09:06.945]  And the type of men and women that work in them.
[00:09:06.945 --> 00:09:12.750]  Because they know, you defend a citizen, you go to jail, you end up like Derek Chauvin.
[00:09:13.684 --> 00:09:16.626]  And speaking of that, that's also coming up next hour.
[00:09:16.626 --> 00:09:26.674]  Derek Chauvin and three other former police indicted by civil rights charges in the death of George Floyd.
[00:09:26.674 --> 00:09:33.380]  And it's the Clintons and Obama that basically run the Biden puppet administration.
[00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:37.203]  And isn't it interesting that, oh, nobody got in trouble for Waco.
[00:09:38.112 --> 00:09:56.482]  Nobody gets in trouble for drone attacks that kill 50 innocent people at a wedding, but kill one quote bad guy, and Obama says I'm really good at killing people, and the Arab Spring that killed millions that Obama and Hillary launched, and destroying Libya, you name it, or the Clintons running the hookah murders, or the Tootsies in Rwanda.
[00:09:56.482 --> 00:09:58.003]  Oh no!
[00:09:58.003 --> 00:09:58.623]  The cop that
[00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:02.181]  Leaned on the guy dying of a heart attack from fentanyl.
[00:10:02.181 --> 00:10:15.746]  He's now been sentenced in a kangaroo court by Black Lives Matter members that wore their Black Lives Matter t-shirts and bragged they were going to convict him, but lied to the court.
[00:10:15.746 --> 00:10:16.566]  Well, don't worry.
[00:10:16.566 --> 00:10:28.691]  Now our new Attorney General is going to show the world how good he is with more charges and more kangaroo trials, because the feds are a bunch of virtue signalers.
[00:10:29.275 --> 00:10:34.038]  Virtuous signaling and leftist propaganda is the CIA, the FBI, the whole government.
[00:10:34.038 --> 00:10:40.241]  It's how the multinational corporations cover up for their crimes, running death camps in China, like big tech does.
[00:10:40.241 --> 00:10:45.504]  And they're teaching us our cities must burn because a few cops might have done something wrong.
[00:10:45.504 --> 00:10:47.485]  And ignoring all the rest of the mass death.
[00:10:47.485 --> 00:10:55.170]  It is a coordinated plan, but just chilling footage of Antifa burning down more police stations, more buildings.
[00:10:56.141 --> 00:10:58.343]  And in saying, we're going to do a lot more.
[00:10:58.343 --> 00:11:11.077]  They are the foot soldiers of Congress, of CNN, that calls them heroes, that calls them anti-fascist, except when they do something bad, oh, then they don't exist.
[00:11:11.077 --> 00:11:12.999]  That's more gaslighting.
[00:11:12.999 --> 00:11:17.744]  So, I've got this huge stack of important news and all the Antifa footage.
[00:11:18.456 --> 00:11:23.218]  And the rest of it, we're going to be throwing bombs going off from the Islamists all over Sweden.
[00:11:23.218 --> 00:11:30.362]  It's not even in the news now, because again, when a Muslim blows something up or stabs somebody to death, he yells, Allah Akbar, it's not Islam.
[00:11:30.362 --> 00:11:30.522]  But!
[00:11:31.112 --> 00:11:39.716]  We've got a bunch of footage of black people stabbing and beating Asians over the head with bricks, and the news says more Asian white supremacist attacks.
[00:11:39.716 --> 00:11:43.838]  They actually say white supremacism, record highs, attacks on Asians.
[00:11:43.838 --> 00:11:45.119]  Totally delusional.
[00:11:45.119 --> 00:11:48.341]  FBI says number one threat, white supremacist attacks on Asians.
[00:11:48.341 --> 00:11:58.406]  It doesn't even exist other than one crazy pervert that went and shot women he was mad at because he'd given them all his paychecks paying for hand jobs.
[00:12:00.237 --> 00:12:05.682]  You see on screen a brutal white supremacist, he happens to have black skin, beating.
[00:12:05.682 --> 00:12:08.584]  He's wearing his mask though, so it's okay.
[00:12:08.584 --> 00:12:11.746]  Beating them with a brick for no reason.
[00:12:11.746 --> 00:12:14.168]  But that's okay, because he's white.
[00:12:14.168 --> 00:12:15.089]  He's a white supremacist.
[00:12:15.089 --> 00:12:21.054]  I mean, actually, he's black, but don't tell the New York Times.
[00:12:21.054 --> 00:12:25.918]  So that's all coming up, as I told you, in the second hour.
[00:12:29.088 --> 00:12:35.573]  Now, the first thing I want to get to is the big issue overall.
[00:12:35.573 --> 00:12:58.292]  And of course, there's forced inoculation, the fact that the injections are killing people, and the fact that the University of Texas knew nine years ago that they tested three COVID vaccines and it killed the mice that were given the shot, causing blood clots, because the body starts eating holes in itself, particularly the lungs.
[00:13:00.632 --> 00:13:03.475]  We're going to get to all that, too, and I'm going to open the phones up.
[00:13:03.475 --> 00:13:07.178]  We're first going to call back folks that were on the line yesterday that I didn't get to.
[00:13:07.178 --> 00:13:17.108]  We're going to open the phones up again for people to tell their testimony about whether they love the vaccine or had no problem with it or whether it was detrimental.
[00:13:17.108 --> 00:13:20.812]  It's your chance, unfiltered, to be on air with us.
[00:13:20.812 --> 00:13:25.036]  We don't screen your calls other than to make sure you're on topic and that you've got a good telephone.
[00:13:26.391 --> 00:13:27.472]  And boy, there's been big developments.
[00:13:27.472 --> 00:13:41.819]  China's top health authority urges a halt to compulsory vaccination, stresses voluntary free inoculation, as in the West they push forced inoculation and bullied inoculation.
[00:13:41.819 --> 00:13:44.061]  That is all coming up as well.
[00:13:44.061 --> 00:13:50.204]  So we've got that and all the massive race war news coming up as well.
[00:13:50.204 --> 00:13:54.186]  Because all this is, is a multi-pronged attack.
[00:13:54.969 --> 00:14:04.195]  You've got the race riots that cover up the economic collapse that's coming from inflation, but those are two weapons against the general public, but they want to have us fighting while they do it.
[00:14:04.195 --> 00:14:20.386]  Then you've got the whole COVID lockdown that's causing the worldwide starvation, the collapse itself, and the police state, and the overarching system that comes with that, that the media praises when police beat up black people, white people, it doesn't matter, for not wearing their mask, or not quarantining, or having a church service.
[00:14:22.143 --> 00:14:30.692]  And then, of course, you've got the spiritual prong attack, all the Satanism and occultism being promoted, and with that, all the gaslighting by design.
[00:14:30.692 --> 00:14:32.494]  Oh, Antifa doesn't exist.
[00:14:32.494 --> 00:14:35.497]  Oh, loving capitalism is white supremacist.
[00:14:35.497 --> 00:14:37.179]  Martin Luther King was a racist.
[00:14:37.179 --> 00:14:39.181]  He's with the white supremacists.
[00:14:39.181 --> 00:14:40.582]  They actually say that now.
[00:14:40.582 --> 00:14:43.926]  And, oh, abortion is good for children, says AOC.
[00:14:45.942 --> 00:14:50.065]  Planned Parenthood is a pro-life organization.
[00:14:50.065 --> 00:14:51.646]  Killing babies is pro-life.
[00:14:51.646 --> 00:14:54.328]  AOC calls herself a Planned Parenthood baby.
[00:14:54.328 --> 00:15:03.315]  We've also got a bunch of new crazy pronouns, where they're calling people who have a baby birthing individuals.
[00:15:03.315 --> 00:15:08.659]  So more bizarre takeover, like space aliens who have landed.
[00:15:08.659 --> 00:15:12.442]  That is all coming up today.
[00:15:13.843 --> 00:15:18.910]  And you also have Biden's DOJ demands access to Arizona election audit.
[00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:25.178]  They're trying to block that now because the audit obviously is finding massive evidence of no signatures on a lot of these mail-in ballots.
[00:15:25.178 --> 00:15:26.961]  Total fraud, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:26.961 --> 00:15:28.703]  People voting two or three times.
[00:15:28.703 --> 00:15:30.626]  Oh yes, they're really upset.
[00:15:30.626 --> 00:15:31.467]  They're really worried.
[00:15:32.102 --> 00:15:38.405]  But the first big news is the economy and the inflation that they cannot hide, and just how bad that's going to be.
[00:15:38.405 --> 00:15:44.588]  I've got a very clear image on exactly how this is going to unfold, how they're going to try to manage this inflation.
[00:15:44.588 --> 00:15:48.169]  But it's not going to work on the other side, so brace yourselves for that.
[00:15:48.169 --> 00:15:48.890]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:51.871]  It's Friday, May 7th.
[00:15:51.871 --> 00:15:53.272]  The year is 2021.
[00:15:53.272 --> 00:15:54.912]  Impolwars.com.
[00:15:54.912 --> 00:15:56.173]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:15:58.539 --> 00:16:03.502]  One of the most popular memes on the internet in the last decade has been, Alex Jones was right.
[00:16:03.502 --> 00:16:12.408]  But it now routinely trends number one on platforms like Twitter and Facebook, making the globalists pull their hair out in anger.
[00:16:12.408 --> 00:16:14.990]  But let me tell you, we are tomorrow's news today.
[00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:15.850]  Thanks for your support.
[00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:19.413]  We're still on air at InfoWars.com and Bandai Video, radio stations and TV stations.
[00:16:19.853 --> 00:16:20.534]  We're good to go.
[00:16:40.117 --> 00:16:41.739]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021.
[00:17:01.329 --> 00:17:02.390]  And I just want to say something.
[00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:07.236]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over the years.
[00:17:07.236 --> 00:17:12.182]  It is truly an answer to prayer, and I am so blessed and thankful for all of you, the listeners of this show.
[00:17:12.182 --> 00:17:17.668]  I want you to know that I love you, and I appreciate you, whether you are old, whether you are... Job's Report.
[00:17:17.668 --> 00:17:18.369]  Let's take a listen.
[00:17:19.111 --> 00:17:22.634]  We never thought that after the first 50 or 60 days every...
[00:17:33.931 --> 00:17:36.832]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[00:17:36.832 --> 00:17:42.452]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us.
[00:17:42.452 --> 00:17:44.353]  Again, that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[00:17:44.353 --> 00:17:48.774]  I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've done.
[00:17:48.774 --> 00:17:52.874]  And just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you.
[00:17:52.874 --> 00:17:55.835]  And hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support InfoWars.
[00:17:55.835 --> 00:17:59.955]  God bless.
[00:17:59.955 --> 00:18:02.576]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:18:27.226 --> 00:18:32.349]  Welcome back to the most outlaw radio broadcast on the planet.
[00:18:32.349 --> 00:18:39.614]  A lot of folks like to dress up in leather outfits and ride around on their motorcycles and tell everybody how they're big outlaws.
[00:18:39.614 --> 00:18:46.318]  A lot of guys like to get into jiu-jitsu and, you know, get in great shape and learn how to fight really well and that's great.
[00:18:46.318 --> 00:18:46.979]  I think that's fine.
[00:18:46.979 --> 00:18:52.803]  In fact, I like all that because we need to be extremely male in a society trying to tell us to be
[00:18:53.801 --> 00:19:08.754]  A little passive slaves of the system, but I'd really like to see all the tough guy men out there spend a little less time hanging out with other dudes, acting tough, and a little more time being politically engaged.
[00:19:08.754 --> 00:19:17.482]  Now, I know when you do that, you get put in prison like the Proud Boys, or you get attacked like InfoWars, but I really need all those tough guys
[00:19:19.252 --> 00:19:19.972]  To get engaged.
[00:19:19.972 --> 00:19:24.275]  And I know Rolling Thunder's a lot of great veterans and patriots that like their fun motorcycles.
[00:19:24.275 --> 00:19:25.555]  Motorcycles are awesome.
[00:19:25.555 --> 00:19:30.878]  Probably nothing funner out there other than what's Waylon Jennings say?
[00:19:30.878 --> 00:19:34.700]  Guitars, the tune, good, firm, feeling women.
[00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:39.923]  But the Pentagon said, you're not welcome here, Rolling Thunder, this year.
[00:19:39.923 --> 00:19:44.765]  That's because our country's been taken over by the CHICOMS and the globalists.
[00:19:44.765 --> 00:19:46.086]  And it really is happening.
[00:19:46.966 --> 00:20:08.275]  And they really are destabilizing the country, and they're going to mask the coming economic collapse that's already begun with racial riots this summer that are going to really make even the burning down of Detroit and other cities in the 1960s pale in significance.
[00:20:08.275 --> 00:20:10.756]  And I'll be covering that, as I said, next hour.
[00:20:10.756 --> 00:20:14.578]  But as we speak, the puppet president
[00:20:16.605 --> 00:20:20.106]  Of the O'Harris administration.
[00:20:20.106 --> 00:20:22.846]  It really is Obama and then their puppet Harris.
[00:20:22.846 --> 00:20:30.228]  Biden can't even read off a teleprompter most of the time now, unless he's carefully hopped up on amphetamines in the morning.
[00:20:30.228 --> 00:20:35.129]  And he's saying, oh, I didn't think we'd turn things around from COVID and the economy right away.
[00:20:35.129 --> 00:20:36.429]  That's why we need more stimulus.
[00:20:36.429 --> 00:20:42.650]  In fact, as soon as I heard he was giving a speech 10 minutes ago, I said, let me guess, in a transcript, he'll say the answer is more stimulus.
[00:20:43.516 --> 00:20:46.557]  Well, no, that's why people won't go to work, because they're getting a check.
[00:20:46.557 --> 00:20:54.421]  They go buy things, and then that makes prices go up, and scarce commodities, because no one is growing the crops.
[00:20:55.788 --> 00:21:04.091]  We're delivering the cattle to slaughter, or building the microchips, or cutting down the timber, or growing the corn, or smelting the steel.
[00:21:04.091 --> 00:21:06.632]  That's why steel tripled in prices the last few months.
[00:21:06.632 --> 00:21:09.833]  That's why corn's up 80% in the last few months, set to triple.
[00:21:09.833 --> 00:21:13.475]  That's why food prices are set to be up 76% by the end of summer.
[00:21:13.475 --> 00:21:16.616]  Current purchases around the world of crops going in.
[00:21:16.616 --> 00:21:17.476]  There's such a scarcity.
[00:21:17.476 --> 00:21:19.777]  People are buying the crops before they're even planted.
[00:21:22.881 --> 00:21:24.082]  And I've got all that data here.
[00:21:24.082 --> 00:21:28.344]  I told you last year, when the first world collapses, the third world dies.
[00:21:28.344 --> 00:21:37.569]  Then the UN will organize that giant third world collapse to break our borders, to flood us, and they'll have a giant underclass permanently controlled, and that's in the globalist documents.
[00:21:37.569 --> 00:21:39.510]  People keep asking how I predict everything.
[00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:40.971]  It's all there.
[00:21:40.971 --> 00:21:50.016]  They create crises, offer a solution that creates a bigger crisis that gives them more power, and they repeat it over and over and over and over again.
[00:21:51.641 --> 00:21:59.445]  And they use the Hegelian dialectic where one leftist calls for sterilizing all boys at birth.
[00:21:59.445 --> 00:22:02.406]  They're actually doing that in academic circles.
[00:22:02.406 --> 00:22:11.411]  And then Caitlyn Jenner says, oh, no, let's sterilize the boys, but let biological girls only compete with each other.
[00:22:11.411 --> 00:22:12.491]  And then he's a hero.
[00:22:12.491 --> 00:22:16.393]  It's how they move the Overton window of what you'll accept.
[00:22:16.393 --> 00:22:17.574]  Oh, it's good cop, bad cop.
[00:22:18.388 --> 00:22:20.289]  Oh, the good cop just says I'm going to jail.
[00:22:20.289 --> 00:22:22.730]  The bad cop says he's going to beat me.
[00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:24.871]  Well, you shouldn't even be going to jail in this hypothetical.
[00:22:24.871 --> 00:22:27.072]  But still, the good cop now you see is your savior.
[00:22:27.072 --> 00:22:33.055]  It's basic psychology and we sit here like idiots and go along with it.
[00:22:35.498 --> 00:22:38.079]  Let's play a few minutes of Biden.
[00:22:38.079 --> 00:22:42.019]  Remember, it wasn't COVID killed the economy, it was the lockdowns.
[00:22:42.019 --> 00:22:50.521]  And India is starving to death, and they went back under lockdown after a year of being under lockdown, and so more people are starving to death, and they call it COVID.
[00:22:50.521 --> 00:22:52.342]  They're not even testing them.
[00:22:52.342 --> 00:22:54.122]  And I predicted a year ago that would be the case.
[00:22:54.122 --> 00:22:58.523]  But you would have missed 280-something million people are starving to death, already tens of millions extra have died.
[00:23:01.457 --> 00:23:02.217]  That's the plan.
[00:23:02.217 --> 00:23:06.839]  Record-level low birth rates in the West.
[00:23:06.839 --> 00:23:10.280]  Half the business is out of business, but you got all this free money.
[00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:14.222]  See, while they're euthanizing you, America is in hospice.
[00:23:14.222 --> 00:23:19.704]  And what do they do when, oh, you're so old, Grandma doesn't feel well, you know, she's a little out of it?
[00:23:21.147 --> 00:23:22.548]  Her life's not that good.
[00:23:22.548 --> 00:23:28.753]  You put them in hospice, and some hospices really help really sick, dying people, but a lot of them are kind of wink-wink.
[00:23:28.753 --> 00:23:33.878]  We're going to put you on what they call memory care, where you don't have memory and everybody's taking care of you and checking on you.
[00:23:33.878 --> 00:23:35.259]  And yeah, you're in a little pain.
[00:23:35.259 --> 00:23:37.481]  Let's give you some opium.
[00:23:37.481 --> 00:23:40.403]  Let's give you some painkillers.
[00:23:40.403 --> 00:23:42.745]  Let's give you some morphine.
[00:23:42.745 --> 00:23:46.168]  And then it's just kind of, oh, you don't eat anymore for a few weeks.
[00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:48.561]  A few months and you die.
[00:23:48.561 --> 00:23:56.226]  And America's on the drip, drip, drip of free money, and nobody wants to go back to work, and it's so much fun, and it's so cool.
[00:23:56.226 --> 00:24:15.497]  But then every business I talk to, whether it's flooring supplies, or concrete, or oil and gas, or whether it's food production, or whether it's supplements, which is really just food production, concentrated food production, ammunition, textiles, everything you can't get.
[00:24:17.242 --> 00:24:26.524]  And it's permanent, because we built this giant infrastructure, and then once you shut half of it down and say it's not essential, well then it doesn't have the reach anymore.
[00:24:26.524 --> 00:24:33.946]  They have a third less drivers they need just to deliver gas, oil, and natural gas.
[00:24:33.946 --> 00:24:42.528]  Diesel shortages, everything, because the humans aren't there to run it, because they were paid to stay at home, and many of the businesses they serve are shut down.
[00:24:42.528 --> 00:24:45.809]  And so for a truck to come to your small town, it needed
[00:24:47.114 --> 00:24:49.895]  Five gas stations to serve.
[00:24:49.895 --> 00:24:54.617]  And it needed to hit six or seven towns that had that many gas stations to come all the way out there.
[00:24:54.617 --> 00:25:04.321]  But now that half the gas stations shut down, now that most of the folks don't travel anymore or do anything in a small town, they just sit there and get their paycheck, well now there aren't as many food deliveries in the town.
[00:25:04.321 --> 00:25:06.422]  There aren't as many gas deliveries.
[00:25:06.422 --> 00:25:10.784]  And then that breaks down the whole society and soon there's nothing.
[00:25:10.784 --> 00:25:14.806]  And that's the post-industrial world that the UN signed on to at Rio de Janeiro.
[00:25:17.493 --> 00:25:23.556]  In 1992, with George Herbert Walker Bush.
[00:25:23.556 --> 00:25:29.720]  It's all computerized, it's all actuaried, it's all battle-planned, it's all prepared.
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:33.362]  And they meant the lockdowns to go a little bit longer in the U.S.
[00:25:33.362 --> 00:25:37.184]  They're still going on in Europe and Canada, and they're never going to recover there already.
[00:25:39.156 --> 00:25:57.285]  And Africa's starving to death, and Latin America's starving to death and collapsing, and the Middle East is, and parts of Asia, and they're all getting organized by the UN to come to Europe and here, and they're going to be filled full of hate of white people, and taught Marxist-Leninist world government theory, and they're going to be given free credit cards and free money, because after all, the globalists are using that as a weapon.
[00:25:57.785 --> 00:26:01.427]  To devalue all your savings and to drive up prices.
[00:26:01.427 --> 00:26:17.998]  And so all the yuppies want to and all the trendies want to watch their Netflix and go to the coffee place and get their check and oh it's for the earth and wear their mask and feel like they're getting ahead and this is all remember oh it's like a two-week extended spring break they said 14 months ago.
[00:26:17.998 --> 00:26:25.363]  Be a hero it's just two weeks stay home and then it was a year in Europe, a year in Canada, six months here,
[00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:29.872]  And total collapse around the world.
[00:26:29.872 --> 00:26:32.954]  And I'll show you the numbers, I'll show you the statistics when we come back.
[00:26:32.954 --> 00:26:38.999]  And so now the third world collapse and the weaponized UN system is coming for everybody.
[00:26:38.999 --> 00:26:44.103]  Congress, our governors, everybody better wake up now and realize this because most of them aren't even informed on this.
[00:26:44.103 --> 00:26:47.725]  They're getting their advice from Frank Luntz, the Democrats.
[00:26:47.725 --> 00:26:52.549]  Frank Luntz couldn't find his ass, his big giant fat ass with both of his perverted hands.
[00:26:52.549 --> 00:26:53.389]  Be right back.
[00:26:55.842 --> 00:26:58.304]  The world is awakening.
[00:26:58.304 --> 00:27:01.806]  The world is beginning to understand the globalist paradigm.
[00:27:01.806 --> 00:27:13.112]  They are discovering the globalists, the elites, the manipulation, the CFR, the Trilateral Commission, the Bilderberg Group, the Bohemian Grove, the Club of Rome.
[00:27:13.112 --> 00:27:22.898]  And so, even though it seems like the globalists are winning, the truth is, they've had to come out in the open to attack human freedom because they're actually losing.
[00:27:22.898 --> 00:27:25.380]  We have forced them out in the open.
[00:27:26.005 --> 00:27:31.829]  So as bad as these times are, and a lot of negative things are about to happen, realize humanity is winning.
[00:27:31.829 --> 00:27:36.872]  You've got to trust in the plan of God, and trust in the plan of God's justice.
[00:27:36.872 --> 00:27:38.313]  That is invincible.
[00:27:38.313 --> 00:27:41.735]  That is ethereal, timeless, and unstoppable.
[00:27:41.735 --> 00:27:47.478]  So don't trust in man, trust in God, to lead God and direct your soul, and then take action against the globalists.
[00:27:47.478 --> 00:27:51.561]  And realize, you've got my commitment from Alex Jones and my crew to you.
[00:27:51.561 --> 00:27:55.343]  We will never back down from the globalists, and we will never surrender.
[00:27:56.821 --> 00:28:08.383]  Your brain, your heart, your bones, your liver, your eyes, everything has a better shot at surviving in this crazy environment when you have high quality fish oil.
[00:28:08.383 --> 00:28:09.683]  We've got the best out there.
[00:28:09.683 --> 00:28:14.824]  We have the highest grade of fish oil available and what it does for your body is simply amazing.
[00:28:14.824 --> 00:28:21.285]  Everybody already knows what high quality fish oil does and it costs us even more to put it through a process to remove any trace mercury that's in it.
[00:28:21.285 --> 00:28:22.686]  This is also cleaned fish oil.
[00:28:22.686 --> 00:28:24.826]  It's been sold out for months but it's back in stock.
[00:28:25.726 --> 00:28:26.006]  50% off.

[00:28:56.760 --> 00:29:03.728]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone from beta testing to operational.
[00:29:04.295 --> 00:29:09.818]  The globalists are out in the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot takeover.
[00:29:09.818 --> 00:29:17.663]  But the good news is we've been working, and you've been working, and others have been working across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to fight it off.
[00:29:17.663 --> 00:29:19.144]  Humanity is strong.
[00:29:19.144 --> 00:29:20.125]  We're incredible.
[00:29:20.125 --> 00:29:23.887]  And if we're aware of the attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating it.
[00:29:23.887 --> 00:29:26.348]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[00:29:26.348 --> 00:29:32.292]  So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential, and warning others is absolutely essential.
[00:29:32.672 --> 00:29:42.341]  At the same time, supporting InfoWars by buying high quality products to keep us on air is essential, because they're great products for you and your family, and they're also funding our operation.

[00:29:44.663 --> 00:29:47.325]  InfoWarsStore.com is incredible.

[00:29:52.650 --> 00:29:56.634]  So get them today at InfoWarsStore.com, and I thank you for being part of the resistance.
[00:29:56.994 --> 00:30:00.477]  Fourteen months ago, I began to sit on the broadcast every day.
[00:30:00.477 --> 00:30:03.640]  When the first world collapses, the third world dies.
[00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:15.531]  We have such a complex civilization with so many billions of moving parts, that when you shut down the first world, it causes a chain reaction that will devastate the third world and really hurt the first world.
[00:30:15.531 --> 00:30:18.534]  Well, now you're hearing about gas shortages all over the United States.
[00:30:19.114 --> 00:30:25.775]  That's because the companies and the systems and the drivers that can barely get the job done before delivering gas have been shut down.
[00:30:25.775 --> 00:30:28.936]  Plus, the Keystone Pipeline's been shut down, along with other pipelines.
[00:30:28.936 --> 00:30:32.377]  The left is now blowing up dams across the U.S.
[00:30:32.377 --> 00:30:33.577]  We're being shut down.
[00:30:33.577 --> 00:30:35.617]  Our coal power plants are off as well.
[00:30:35.617 --> 00:30:38.558]  Ladies and gentlemen, prepare to be a total slave.
[00:30:38.558 --> 00:30:39.958]  The third world is imploding as well.
[00:30:39.958 --> 00:30:41.178]  The borders have been removed.
[00:30:41.178 --> 00:30:46.059]  Until you wake up and this is a globalist chi-com takeover, Gregory said, you have no hope.
[00:30:46.059 --> 00:30:48.780]  They're announcing that there will be less than two-thirds of the gas
[00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:51.202]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:25.126]  In 1814 we took a little trip along with Colonel Jackson down to mighty Mississippi.
[00:31:25.126 --> 00:31:30.552]  We took a little bacon and we took a little beans and we caught the bloody British in a town in New Orleans.
[00:31:30.552 --> 00:31:33.275]  We fired our guns and the British kept a coming.
[00:31:33.275 --> 00:31:35.957]  There wasn't as many as there was a while ago.
[00:31:35.957 --> 00:31:40.963]  We fired once more and they began to run it on down to Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
[00:31:43.243 --> 00:31:52.951]  Well... Alright, I'm going to give the phone number out here in a few minutes and we're also going to get on the board callers that I promised to call back yesterday that we're still holding when the broadcast ended.
[00:31:52.951 --> 00:31:53.732]  Your stories of vaccines.
[00:31:53.732 --> 00:31:54.412]  Did you love them?
[00:31:54.412 --> 00:31:55.073]  Did you hate them?
[00:31:55.073 --> 00:31:56.494]  Was there any response?
[00:31:56.494 --> 00:31:57.314]  Did you get sick?
[00:31:57.314 --> 00:31:57.875]  Did you feel great?
[00:32:12.293 --> 00:32:18.035]  Like different CNN hosts have said, it just was euphoric and it was like taking a wonderful drug.
[00:32:18.035 --> 00:32:19.536]  All pure bull, of course.
[00:32:19.536 --> 00:32:20.376]  I'd like to hear from you.
[00:32:20.376 --> 00:32:21.296]  How long have the number out now?
[00:32:21.296 --> 00:32:21.356]  877-789-2539?
[00:32:21.356 --> 00:32:21.416]  877-789-2539.
[00:32:21.416 --> 00:32:21.576]  877-789-Alex.
[00:32:21.576 --> 00:32:25.938]  And that is obviously for first-time callers who are medical workers or nurses or people that work in
[00:32:38.038 --> 00:32:42.562]  Pharmacies, people that work in nursing homes, we'd like to hear your take.
[00:32:42.562 --> 00:32:47.627]  877-789-2539 today.
[00:32:47.627 --> 00:32:55.194]  And as I said, I'm going to get into the whole race war, and the globalists are trying to start to overshadow and smokescreen that it's an economic collapse we're witnessing.
[00:32:55.194 --> 00:33:03.321]  The Federal Reserve trying to cover up for hyperinflation, which is really almost a form of stag inflation.
[00:33:03.996 --> 00:33:13.584]  Or stagflation, because you're going to have a shutdown and a shortage of goods and a shortage of workers because they're paid not to work.
[00:33:13.584 --> 00:33:17.708]  But then you're also going to have an increase in prices because of scarcity.
[00:33:17.708 --> 00:33:20.070]  We haven't seen that since the 1970s.
[00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:25.635]  Economists can argue all day about what this is going to do, but there's a race to devalue currencies around the world.
[00:33:25.635 --> 00:33:29.558]  And Joe Biden wanting to print $4 trillion certainly isn't going to help.
[00:33:30.819 --> 00:33:39.421]  But we passed that Rubicon a long, long, long, long time ago, by the time Trump was trying to restart the economy doing it.
[00:33:39.421 --> 00:33:40.841]  We were far gone at that point.
[00:33:40.841 --> 00:33:44.322]  These global currencies are going to have to be reset.
[00:33:44.322 --> 00:33:50.924]  The globalists are going to reset them where they get all the money up front, but also less value, and you get the debt on the other side.
[00:33:50.924 --> 00:34:00.446]  Then they're going to tell you, well, submit to our political whims and we'll give you a universal income of $1,200 a month on average or so, which again in this future won't buy you a pot
[00:34:01.067 --> 00:34:04.069]  To piss in or a window to throw it out of.
[00:34:04.069 --> 00:34:05.310]  So I'm not trying to scary.
[00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:07.351]  I'm not trying to be negative.
[00:34:07.351 --> 00:34:09.813]  It was not hard last year.
[00:34:09.813 --> 00:34:12.615]  But I was on air.
[00:34:12.615 --> 00:34:14.456]  To say.
[00:34:14.456 --> 00:34:20.781]  The smartest bet you can make is getting storable food and getting out of the cities because this lockdown is never going to end.
[00:34:20.781 --> 00:34:23.202]  They'll take it off for a little while only to put it back on.
[00:34:23.202 --> 00:34:24.183]  That's the plan.
[00:34:24.183 --> 00:34:25.384]  We've got all their battle plans.
[00:34:25.384 --> 00:34:26.104]  My goodness.
[00:34:26.104 --> 00:34:26.925]  We've got their playbooks.
[00:34:27.737 --> 00:34:29.398]  And you see it already happening in Europe and other areas.
[00:34:29.398 --> 00:34:30.059]  It's coming back here.
[00:34:30.059 --> 00:34:33.962]  They're saying, oh, now for the flu or now for new variants.
[00:34:33.962 --> 00:34:37.684]  But they always want you to think you're going to get out of it so you don't ever resist.
[00:34:37.684 --> 00:34:41.767]  And when they finally clamp down the third or fourth time, it'll never come off.
[00:34:41.767 --> 00:34:52.115]  It'll only get tighter and tighter and tighter, as you see already happening in Spain and in London and in areas of Canada where they are under real hardcore martial law.
[00:34:52.839 --> 00:34:55.161]  The answer is stop complying, stop following it.
[00:34:55.161 --> 00:35:03.606]  The government's outlaw, the government's criminal, the government's oppressing you, the government's not legitimate, it's Chi-Com globalist run.
[00:35:03.606 --> 00:35:08.490]  So following its directives is now a crime against your family and humanity.
[00:35:08.490 --> 00:35:22.479]  Any of this unconstitutional crap, any of the contact tracers, any intimidation to have inoculations, anybody telling you you gotta wear a mask, anybody giving you this crap is part of the enemy army, literally, that engineered this whole damn thing out of Wuhan.
[00:35:22.995 --> 00:35:24.376]  And it is a real virus.
[00:35:24.376 --> 00:35:28.999]  If you don't have your right vitamins and minerals, any virus can kill you deader than a hammer.
[00:35:28.999 --> 00:35:45.410]  But I showed you the University of Texas Level 4 Bioweapons Lab, one of the top five in the world, tell you nine years ago that they tested coronavirus vaccines on lab rats and it killed them with blood clots!
[00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:46.691]  And so that's the bottom line.
[00:35:46.691 --> 00:35:50.374]  Yeah, when I tell people that it's a UN consortium of Soros
[00:35:52.535 --> 00:36:00.462]  The British Royal Family and the Clintons globally get hundreds of billions of dollars now.
[00:36:00.462 --> 00:36:05.245]  Where governments, I mean, Texas coughed up several billion to Google to run contact tracing.
[00:36:05.245 --> 00:36:06.667]  It's like three billion dollars?
[00:36:06.667 --> 00:36:09.089]  The governor did?
[00:36:09.089 --> 00:36:18.396]  And then that's given to Google and then they hire leftists out of a database and they're giving them law enforcement power in many areas of the country and the world.
[00:36:18.396 --> 00:36:20.578]  I mean, these are gangs, folks.
[00:36:20.578 --> 00:36:21.519]  You know, you heard of the
[00:36:22.890 --> 00:36:31.335]  Mexican Mafia, you heard of the Hells Angels, you know, MS-13, the Chinese Triads, you all heard of those kind of gangs?
[00:36:31.335 --> 00:36:33.517]  Those kind of gangs are nothing!
[00:36:33.517 --> 00:36:45.785]  This is big tech, and the lawyers, and the media, and the Democrats, and the foreign banks, and the Chinese, and the Islamists, and Hollywood, all ganged up on us with academia as well!
[00:36:45.785 --> 00:36:50.588]  That's why Rebel Media is such great folks.
[00:36:52.344 --> 00:36:58.047]  Had their banking taken away from them yesterday, with their PayPal.
[00:36:58.047 --> 00:37:00.709]  Because they're a good, decent media group.
[00:37:00.709 --> 00:37:07.133]  And the globals want to do it to everybody, so we've got to create our own banks, our own systems, our own infrastructure.
[00:37:07.133 --> 00:37:12.215]  And people are starting to do that, and I'll just leave it at that.
[00:37:12.215 --> 00:37:16.418]  But separately, steel prices have tripled, corn has exploded, every commodity is exploding.
[00:37:18.146 --> 00:37:43.894]  And that's why I said, get into a basket of commodities, that's my advice to myself, if I was an investor, and get invested in a place in the country, doesn't need to be fancy, but away from people, and know your neighbors, and have friends and family that are aware, and having your own gang, your own people to watch each other's back, is the most valuable thing in this universe, other than a relationship with Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
[00:37:43.894 --> 00:37:45.175]  And so you better get ready now.
[00:37:45.862 --> 00:37:47.324]  I mean, look, I told you this a year ago.
[00:37:47.324 --> 00:37:51.387]  Buy ammo, buy guns, they're going to steal the election from Trump.
[00:37:51.387 --> 00:37:52.469]  Then they're going to really clamp down.
[00:37:52.469 --> 00:37:55.471]  They're going to start a race war as the cover for the economic collapse.
[00:37:55.471 --> 00:37:57.113]  This is all a battle plan.
[00:37:57.113 --> 00:37:58.534]  We know what they're going to do.
[00:37:58.534 --> 00:37:59.996]  We should have been able to stop it.
[00:37:59.996 --> 00:38:01.197]  Enough folks didn't listen.
[00:38:01.197 --> 00:38:04.320]  Now people are listening.
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:06.722]  And I don't say that to act tough.
[00:38:06.722 --> 00:38:08.024]  I don't say that to be impressive.
[00:38:08.024 --> 00:38:10.286]  It's just everybody needs to know what you've done keeping us on the air.
[00:38:15.461 --> 00:38:18.706]  We have all the big so-called government intelligence agencies listening.
[00:38:18.706 --> 00:38:27.618]  They're now just like the schedule webs on a Labrador Retriever's feet.
[00:38:27.618 --> 00:38:28.079]  Or it's like a
[00:38:29.428 --> 00:38:31.870]  It's like people that grow a sixth co or something.
[00:38:31.870 --> 00:38:32.550]  They don't run anything.
[00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:33.411]  They don't have any power.
[00:38:33.411 --> 00:38:33.931]  They're just puppets.
[00:38:33.931 --> 00:38:37.013]  It's the corporations, the private groups, the big tech.
[00:38:37.013 --> 00:38:42.717]  It's got their own hit teams, their own labs making deadly synthetic drugs.
[00:38:42.717 --> 00:38:47.080]  I mean, just their own pedophile operations is giant industrial level evil.
[00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:56.267]  Just chewing up humanity like a combine cuts wheat or bales grass into bales of hay.
[00:38:56.267 --> 00:38:58.128]  And as soon as we realize how much trouble we're in,
[00:38:59.045 --> 00:39:10.752]  We'll be able to turn this around, but I told everybody this, so I'll do a plug right now, because I sell and stay on air with what I do myself.
[00:39:10.752 --> 00:39:12.513]  And I got the best storable food company.
[00:39:12.513 --> 00:39:14.174]  We sell directly from PullWorksStore.com.
[00:39:14.174 --> 00:39:15.114]  They're full catalog.
[00:39:15.114 --> 00:39:18.356]  You get 10% off, the lowest price already out there.
[00:39:18.356 --> 00:39:21.538]  But I can only run that until next week, next Wednesday.
[00:39:23.002 --> 00:39:25.624]  And they've already gone up on prices three times the last year.
[00:39:25.624 --> 00:39:29.466]  Other groups have gone up way more than that because we told you the food prices are exploding.
[00:39:29.466 --> 00:39:36.990]  So I would get 20-20 food prices now at preparewithalex.com or just find the subsection Restorable Food and fullrestore.com.
[00:39:36.990 --> 00:39:38.631]  And I would buy a lot of food.
[00:39:38.631 --> 00:39:40.272]  I'm buying more storable food.
[00:39:40.272 --> 00:39:42.954]  I'm buying more ammunition.
[00:39:42.954 --> 00:39:45.215]  I am selling my house in Austin.
[00:39:47.731 --> 00:39:50.672]  Just had the realtor photographer over to get that done.
[00:39:50.672 --> 00:39:59.394]  And I am telling you right now, ladies and gentlemen, that there's a 90% chance we're going to go road warrior in this country for probably 5, 10 years.
[00:39:59.394 --> 00:40:04.756]  I mean, it's going to... When this is all over, I would be surprised if 50 million, 100 million people aren't dead.
[00:40:04.756 --> 00:40:07.077]  And you know, I've never talked like that in my 27 years on air.
[00:40:07.077 --> 00:40:11.478]  I genuinely think that 90% chance it's all over.
[00:40:12.094 --> 00:40:12.735]  Okay.
[00:40:12.735 --> 00:40:18.641]  Long, evil, dark age, giant wars, bioweapons for real being released, probably even nuclear war.
[00:40:18.641 --> 00:40:19.802]  I mean, it's on.
[00:40:19.802 --> 00:40:21.604]  The collapse of civilizations here.
[00:40:21.604 --> 00:40:24.067]  So I would get storable food while you can.
[00:40:24.067 --> 00:40:28.091]  I believe, and my supplier has scaled up to triple what they were just two years ago,
[00:40:30.129 --> 00:40:36.834]  The Metro put our money where our mouth is, that there will be giant lines for food within six months to a year.
[00:40:36.834 --> 00:40:38.135]  And I hope I'm wrong.
[00:40:38.135 --> 00:40:41.298]  I hope some miracles happen, but that's the trajectory of where we're going.
[00:40:41.298 --> 00:40:42.459]  So I'd get ready now.
[00:40:42.459 --> 00:40:44.801]  Three months, six months, your supplies.
[00:40:44.801 --> 00:40:47.783]  Infowarsstore.com, ParallelAlex.com, or AAA253-3139.
[00:40:47.783 --> 00:40:51.866]  All right, I'm going to finish up with the economic news.
[00:40:51.866 --> 00:40:55.389]  Take your phone calls on the vaccines you've taken or what you've heard.
[00:40:57.190 --> 00:40:58.951]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut.
[00:40:58.951 --> 00:40:59.452]  You're on the air.
[00:40:59.452 --> 00:40:59.992]  Thanks for holding.
[00:40:59.992 --> 00:41:00.152]  Hello.
[00:41:00.152 --> 00:41:01.033]  Can you hear me?
[00:41:01.033 --> 00:41:01.673]  I sure can, sir.
[00:41:01.673 --> 00:41:02.013]  Thank you.
[00:41:02.013 --> 00:41:02.754]  Hey, Alex.
[00:41:02.754 --> 00:41:08.978]  Before I start, man, I just wanted to talk to you, bro, and it's a pleasure to be talking right now with you, man.
[00:41:08.978 --> 00:41:10.319]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[00:41:10.319 --> 00:41:14.442]  I'm calling from New Brent, Connecticut, and I just want to plug in.
[00:41:14.442 --> 00:41:18.565]  I'm a truck driver, and two befores have changed the way I drive.
[00:41:18.565 --> 00:41:23.008]  Me and my brothers that drive, and a couple of us, we're all Hispanics.
[00:41:23.368 --> 00:41:34.274]  Cubans, Puerto Ricans, we used to be on Monster and Red Bull and all that, and I have lost weight because I stopped drinking all that sugar, and I just want to thank you for that, man.
[00:41:34.274 --> 00:41:39.917]  Well, brother, we put more in this than any other long-term, high-quality energy powder there is.
[00:41:39.917 --> 00:41:42.218]  So this was designed by one of the top guys in the country.
[00:41:42.218 --> 00:41:47.340]  He didn't want his name on it because, obviously, the political issues, but we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it.
[00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:50.682]  And we believe it is the best, strongest, but healthiest energy
[00:41:50.902 --> 00:42:02.548]  When listeners call into the show and thank me for all I've done, I always stop them and I say, thank you for what you've done.
[00:42:02.548 --> 00:42:04.509]  Thank you for keeping Input Wars on the air.
[00:42:04.509 --> 00:42:05.949]  Thank you for praying for us.
[00:42:05.949 --> 00:42:07.030]  And thank you for spreading the word.
[00:42:08.257 --> 00:42:18.680]  If all of you will simply go to InfoWareStore.com and get a privacy pocket for your iPhone or Droid, it will teach you and others that these things are surveilling you.
[00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:24.082]  It will remind you every day like it does me and my family, and it will protect where you go and what you do.
[00:42:24.642 --> 00:42:30.607]  Not because you've done something wrong, but because the big telecoms, big tech, and the globalists are predatory and are evil.
[00:42:30.607 --> 00:42:37.113]  And in this surveillance state, we need to more and more start doing everything we can to mitigate the criminal activity they're involved in.
[00:42:37.113 --> 00:42:39.595]  These are the highest quality, highest ratings.
[00:42:39.595 --> 00:42:42.118]  They're available at InfoWareStore.com in four different colors.
[00:42:42.718 --> 00:42:43.859]  And they are only $19.95.
[00:42:43.859 --> 00:42:48.620]  The exact same pocket is sold for $24.95 or even $29.95 everywhere.
[00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:51.802]  They're available right now for $19.95 and they fund the Infowar.
[00:42:51.802 --> 00:42:54.863]  Please take action today, protect your privacy, and fund the Infowar.
[00:42:57.288 --> 00:43:05.975]  Listeners have rightfully been complaining the last six months or so, saying, where are most of the best-selling products you have that we love?
[00:43:05.975 --> 00:43:08.217]  And my answer is, the supply chain has broken down.
[00:43:08.217 --> 00:43:12.500]  I have to either reformulate or I have to lower the quality to get a lot of these.
[00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:14.882]  And so that's why we don't have a lot of products in.
[00:43:14.882 --> 00:43:19.166]  That's why InfoWars is in financial trouble, is because if we had the products, you would be buying it.
[00:43:19.166 --> 00:43:20.247]  We have the money.
[00:43:20.247 --> 00:43:21.808]  But so many of them have been sold out.
[00:43:22.168 --> 00:43:27.732]  Just like you noticed, a lot of other items at the store aren't available because civilization is being artificially imploded.
[00:43:27.732 --> 00:43:36.357]  But, finally, X2 is back in stock with a good halogen, Deep Earth Crystal Iodine, so essential in your body, it's really the missing link.
[00:43:36.357 --> 00:43:37.178]  It's 50% off.
[00:43:37.178 --> 00:43:40.340]  We've got a big shipment of it at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:43.082]  Now when it gets ready to sell out, we'll have to go back to near full price.
[00:43:43.582 --> 00:43:44.802]  Take advantage of this now.
[00:43:44.802 --> 00:43:45.363]  Stock up.
[00:43:45.363 --> 00:43:46.443]  And don't forget to take your X2.
[00:43:46.443 --> 00:43:50.444]  Because I have a tendency to forget how great it is and not take it myself.
[00:43:50.444 --> 00:43:54.146]  But when I do, stamina, libido, energy, weight loss, it's incredible.
[00:43:54.146 --> 00:43:55.006]  It's essential.
[00:43:55.006 --> 00:43:57.267]  It's X2 at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:43:57.267 --> 00:43:59.627]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point.
[00:43:59.627 --> 00:44:01.368]  It's very bittersweet.
[00:44:01.368 --> 00:44:04.369]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would.
[00:44:04.369 --> 00:44:05.609]  And now we have a lot of credibility.
[00:44:05.609 --> 00:44:06.550]  But I don't care about that.
[00:44:06.550 --> 00:44:07.810]  I care about beating the new world order.
[00:44:08.576 --> 00:44:13.281]  And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[00:44:13.281 --> 00:44:16.645]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons.
[00:44:16.645 --> 00:44:18.167]  I can't tell you what's going on.
[00:44:18.167 --> 00:44:19.348]  But let's just say this.
[00:44:19.348 --> 00:44:20.670]  We're going to see this through to the end.
[00:44:20.670 --> 00:44:23.133]  We're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[00:44:23.753 --> 00:44:27.395]  So please pray for us and please buy the products at mfulworthstore.com.
[00:44:27.395 --> 00:44:29.976]  They're great products, plus they fund the operation.
[00:44:29.976 --> 00:44:33.157]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[00:44:33.157 --> 00:44:33.997]  Do they fund freedom?
[00:44:33.997 --> 00:44:35.118]  No, a lot of them don't.
[00:44:35.118 --> 00:44:41.580]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth.
[00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:43.301]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[00:44:43.301 --> 00:44:46.142]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[00:44:46.702 --> 00:44:49.825]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[00:44:49.825 --> 00:45:00.072]  Download everything we've done you can find and save it, because who knows how long we're going to be on the air and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[00:45:00.072 --> 00:45:08.379]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:45:08.379 --> 00:45:12.462]  The only two things in life that make it worth living
[00:45:14.304 --> 00:45:16.606]  Let's go to Luckenbach, Texas!
[00:45:16.606 --> 00:45:21.330]  Hell, I might actually move out by Luckenbach.
[00:45:21.330 --> 00:45:23.412]  I'm looking at that.
[00:45:42.239 --> 00:45:44.480]  The successful life we're living.
[00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:47.342]  Crank it up for a minute for me.
[00:46:09.557 --> 00:46:17.780]  You know, sometimes when I want to play a little bit of music, I want to just cut to a shot maybe of the wall, so I'm not staring at my ugly fat head while I play it.
[00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:24.943]  So baby, let's sell your diamond ring and buy some boots and faded jeans and go away.
[00:46:24.943 --> 00:46:33.126]  This broken tie is choking me, and in your high society you cried all day.
[00:46:37.427 --> 00:46:46.791]  They can't keep up with the Jones.
[00:46:46.791 --> 00:46:49.391]  All right, folks, welcome back.
[00:46:49.391 --> 00:46:51.092]  I really appreciate y'all.
[00:46:51.092 --> 00:46:53.913]  It'd be nice to be sitting out on the creek somewhere fishing.
[00:46:53.913 --> 00:47:00.795]  Listen, a little bit of a little bit of Waylon Jennings and Willie and the boys.
[00:47:00.795 --> 00:47:03.216]  Never got a chance to hang out with Waylon Jennings.
[00:47:04.207 --> 00:47:07.129]  But I have hung out quite a bit with old Willie Nelson.
[00:47:07.129 --> 00:47:11.011]  And I've hung out quite a bit with Will and Jennings' son, who's just as talented as he is.
[00:47:11.011 --> 00:47:15.813]  You know, usually, a lot of times, the son isn't as talented as the superstar father.
[00:47:15.813 --> 00:47:18.315]  But old Shooter Jennings is amazing.
[00:47:18.315 --> 00:47:20.576]  He does a lot of big genres of music.
[00:47:20.576 --> 00:47:22.157]  He's invited me on the road with him and stuff.
[00:47:22.157 --> 00:47:28.600]  I never had time to do it, but... After the collapse, we'll probably all have a lot of time to sit around.
[00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:30.221]  Hopefully, we'll all have food during it.
[00:47:30.221 --> 00:47:31.242]  Let me get real serious.
[00:47:32.993 --> 00:47:38.735]  It's hard to go ahead and just say all these things on air, but I meant everything I said earlier.
[00:47:38.735 --> 00:47:46.039]  They have designed a planetary collapse, and they're not just going to collapse the third world and let folks starve to death en masse.
[00:47:46.039 --> 00:48:01.507]  They're planning to use major civil unrest and civil war here to just destroy our political system, destroy our prosperity, and create so much hell that we accept the end of all our basic freedoms going forward.
[00:48:02.250 --> 00:48:09.612]  And the whole COVID lockdown is just the first shalvo of that to get us off balance and get us prepared for it.
[00:48:09.612 --> 00:48:14.233]  And so, if I was you, I would get ready.
[00:48:14.233 --> 00:48:15.593]  And that means spiritually get ready.
[00:48:15.593 --> 00:48:20.955]  It means sit down with your friends and family and have real talks with them.
[00:48:20.955 --> 00:48:25.156]  I've been having talks with my friends, my family, my wife on a daily basis.
[00:48:25.156 --> 00:48:30.477]  I just stop people when we're standing around the break room or when I'm at home with my children at night.
[00:48:31.101 --> 00:48:34.043]  And I just get my wife by the arm and I say, listen to me.
[00:48:34.043 --> 00:48:38.226]  All this stuff isn't going to be here, sir.
[00:48:38.226 --> 00:48:38.726]  90% chance.
[00:48:38.726 --> 00:48:41.908]  And she's seen me right enough and she knows I'm not joking around.
[00:48:41.908 --> 00:48:43.049]  And she understands it.
[00:48:43.049 --> 00:48:46.151]  But I've got to get this straight through my head, too.
[00:48:46.151 --> 00:48:48.413]  We don't have a lot of time.
[00:48:48.413 --> 00:48:51.435]  Every day, every week, we're still on air as a blessing, folks.
[00:48:51.435 --> 00:48:55.938]  I really don't think we're going to be on air in a year on the current trajectory we're on.
[00:48:55.938 --> 00:48:57.519]  The globalists aren't going to give Trump a chance.
[00:48:58.513 --> 00:49:01.996]  They're not going to give the Republicans a chance to take back the House and probably the Senate.
[00:49:01.996 --> 00:49:03.657]  They had to steal that last election.
[00:49:03.657 --> 00:49:04.778]  That was a landslide.
[00:49:04.778 --> 00:49:08.702]  They're making their move, people!
[00:49:08.702 --> 00:49:11.504]  This isn't a damn drill.
[00:49:11.504 --> 00:49:14.226]  Everything else you saw was a probe.
[00:49:14.226 --> 00:49:15.808]  Everything else you've seen was a test.
[00:49:15.808 --> 00:49:19.330]  I'm getting chills right now like a lightning bolt just struck me.
[00:49:19.330 --> 00:49:20.191]  You know when I get the chills?
[00:49:20.191 --> 00:49:22.073]  When I'm right.
[00:49:22.073 --> 00:49:24.595]  The chills are when your spirit knows you're right and says, that's it.
[00:49:25.396 --> 00:49:30.178]  The creepy crawlies in the back of your neck when you're around somebody creepy, and your soul's telling you they're bad.
[00:49:30.178 --> 00:49:33.199]  You need to start following those feelings, folks.
[00:49:33.199 --> 00:49:38.101]  And all the evidence for the feelings is right here, too.
[00:49:38.101 --> 00:49:39.621]  We better get on our knees and pray to God.
[00:49:39.621 --> 00:49:40.822]  Look, look.
[00:49:40.822 --> 00:49:45.123]  Tell me which callers were on the line yesterday so I can go to them first when we start the next hour.
[00:49:45.123 --> 00:49:52.906]  I know it was Nicole and Sarah and a few others, but just put a little... Oh, I see it says yesterday, yesterday, yesterday.
[00:49:52.906 --> 00:49:54.447]  So I'll go to Nicole and Brian.
[00:49:55.433 --> 00:49:57.514]  And others that we're holding first.
[00:49:57.514 --> 00:50:06.657]  And then we'll get to Ed and John and Nelson and Creed and Sarah and so many others that are patiently holding when we start the next hour.
[00:50:06.657 --> 00:50:13.319]  And then I'll get into the anti-communist and what they're doing around the world and all the rest of it after we've done that.
[00:50:13.319 --> 00:50:16.480]  But these are the times that try men's souls.
[00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:17.240]  Make no mistake.
[00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:23.563]  And then one of my writers came over to me and gave me this article.
[00:50:23.563 --> 00:50:24.723]  It's in BuzzFeed.
[00:50:26.013 --> 00:50:49.652]  To the Daily Beast it's in Sputnik and it's coming out the divorce of Bill and Melinda Gates and what did I tell you that my gut all the evidence told me was why Melinda Gates left him was to keep the foundation safe when he goes down and to move the halo as Dr. Mercola said he had a better way of saying it from Bill who's going down to Melinda Melinda's just as bad from our intel but but what what's the final straw for her
[00:50:52.253 --> 00:50:56.895]  Not just Jeffrey Epstein he hang out with, another dead, arrested pedophile.
[00:50:56.895 --> 00:51:02.897]  Who was that big Canadian fashion guy that turned out to be a big pedo, best buddies with him?
[00:51:02.897 --> 00:51:04.697]  Peter Nygaard.
[00:51:04.697 --> 00:51:06.818]  Peter Nygaard.
[00:51:06.818 --> 00:51:08.939]  That's right, thanks for remembering that.
[00:51:08.939 --> 00:51:10.639]  So, there you go.
[00:51:10.639 --> 00:51:19.322]  Melinda Gates reportedly turned on him over the fact that he likes to hang out and have sex with 12 year old girls.
[00:51:21.773 --> 00:51:33.359]  Some of them, well that's what we know are at the houses he stayed at, flown in on airplanes, bought from their parents in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
[00:51:33.359 --> 00:51:35.361]  Yeah, that's their favorites.
[00:51:35.361 --> 00:51:45.666]  Nine times out of ten, their little harems are Eastern European girls out of Ukraine, and out of Serbia, Bosnia, Albania.
[00:51:45.666 --> 00:51:48.648]  They just sell their children.
[00:51:50.618 --> 00:51:54.279]  Plus, people have been selling their kids for a long time over there since the Muslims took over.
[00:51:54.279 --> 00:51:55.820]  They invaded over a thousand years ago.
[00:51:55.820 --> 00:51:56.920]  They stopped them a bunch.
[00:51:56.920 --> 00:51:59.001]  Of course, they didn't stop them now.
[00:51:59.001 --> 00:52:04.502]  Old Clinton bombed Serbs for daring to fight the precious little Muslims.
[00:52:04.502 --> 00:52:08.384]  Canadian fashion mogul Peter Nygaard arrested on federal sex trafficking charges.
[00:52:08.384 --> 00:52:11.065]  What did I say the day of the event?
[00:52:11.065 --> 00:52:15.206]  I said, I bet it comes out it's because he's going down for the pedo ranks.
[00:52:16.465 --> 00:52:18.266]  And now, Jiminy Crickets.
[00:52:18.266 --> 00:52:19.527]  It's in the news.
[00:52:19.527 --> 00:52:21.729]  InfoWars.com.
[00:52:21.729 --> 00:52:22.809]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:52:22.809 --> 00:52:25.191]  But since I mentioned it, let me show you this stuff.
[00:52:25.191 --> 00:52:28.053]  Overhead shot, please, for TV viewers.
[00:52:28.053 --> 00:52:29.474]  Radio listeners can pull all this up.
[00:52:29.474 --> 00:52:31.055]  Literally shocking data.
[00:52:31.055 --> 00:52:33.156]  April payrolls miss huge.
[00:52:33.156 --> 00:52:37.319]  266,000 K jobs added below expectations of 1 million.
[00:52:37.319 --> 00:52:42.363]  And Biden's off explaining that Hill's going to save you from the lockdown they put in place.
[00:52:42.363 --> 00:52:42.823]  As Biden
[00:52:43.536 --> 00:52:46.618]  Pushes trillions of stimulus, employers struggle to lure people back to work.
[00:52:46.618 --> 00:52:48.119]  Yeah, it's called free money.
[00:52:48.119 --> 00:52:52.502]  No one wants to work, so it creates scarcity and inflation.
[00:52:52.502 --> 00:52:56.645]  Printing money creates inflation, but if there's a glut of goods, you can hold it off some.
[00:52:56.645 --> 00:53:03.670]  When there's a shortage and money printing, it's called perfect storm, and the globalists did it on purpose.
[00:53:03.670 --> 00:53:07.193]  How trillions of newly printed money created a labor shortage.
[00:53:07.193 --> 00:53:09.094]  Who's hiring and who's firing?
[00:53:09.094 --> 00:53:11.836]  Golden age for waiters and card dealers.
[00:53:12.623 --> 00:53:15.166]  Everybody's literally playing cards as the Titanic sinks.
[00:53:15.166 --> 00:53:16.107]  Not me.
[00:53:16.107 --> 00:53:17.708]  I'm already in the lifeboat.
[00:53:17.708 --> 00:53:22.933]  The Fed embraces its inner Zimbabwean socialism.
[00:53:22.933 --> 00:53:27.417]  Payroll numbers collapse as Americans paid to sit home and watch TV.
[00:53:27.417 --> 00:53:31.922]  Corn prices touch 8-year high as Albert Edwards worries about food inflation.
[00:53:33.081 --> 00:53:34.923]  One bank warns of soaring food prices.
[00:53:34.923 --> 00:53:40.267]  Global index 76% increase by end of summer in already made purchases.
[00:53:40.267 --> 00:53:42.388]  Worldwide Bloomberg Agra index.
[00:53:42.388 --> 00:53:48.893]  How Costco is masking a 14% price in food with shrinkflation.
[00:53:48.893 --> 00:53:53.757]  By just giving you less but more air in the packaging and injecting water into the beef and chicken.
[00:53:53.757 --> 00:53:56.038]  Fed officials says inflation will be temporary.
[00:53:56.038 --> 00:53:57.039]  Yeah, like death.
[00:53:57.039 --> 00:53:59.281]  Like the toilet paper shortage last year.
[00:53:59.281 --> 00:54:00.522]  Yeah, right, sure.
[00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:06.803]  It's all there, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54:06.803 --> 00:54:08.424]  Oh my goodness.
[00:54:08.424 --> 00:54:10.165]  What a big deal.
[00:54:10.165 --> 00:54:10.925]  What a problem.
[00:54:10.925 --> 00:54:14.967]  It makes me have an anxiety attack.
[00:54:14.967 --> 00:54:16.868]  I mean, again, I'm not somebody that has anxiety attacks.
[00:54:16.868 --> 00:54:19.390]  I can give a speech to 10,000 people.
[00:54:19.390 --> 00:54:20.630]  I can be about to get in a fight.
[00:54:20.630 --> 00:54:21.791]  I feel great.
[00:54:21.791 --> 00:54:24.713]  My heart even hardly speeds up.
[00:54:24.713 --> 00:54:27.874]  But right now, my heart's going pitter-patter, pitter-patter.
[00:54:27.874 --> 00:54:30.616]  And I'm having an anxiety attack because
[00:54:31.804 --> 00:54:32.864]  I want to stop this.
[00:54:32.864 --> 00:54:34.985]  It's like knowing a kid's tied to the railroad tracks.
[00:54:34.985 --> 00:54:35.865]  You're a kid.
[00:54:35.865 --> 00:54:38.006]  But you're chained up yourself down the road in the basement.
[00:54:38.006 --> 00:54:39.706]  You can't get there and save your kid.
[00:54:39.706 --> 00:54:42.427]  We are all going over the edge of a cliff right now.
[00:54:42.427 --> 00:54:44.667]  We're in that magic moment.
[00:54:44.667 --> 00:54:46.668]  But you know the public's not going to wake up.
[00:54:46.668 --> 00:54:48.888]  And you know the Globalists are going to keep pushing.
[00:54:48.888 --> 00:54:52.409]  And so we're going over the waterfall, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54:52.409 --> 00:54:55.350]  Niagara Falls, right in the mouth of Satan.
[00:54:55.350 --> 00:54:56.690]  And I guess we kind of deserve it.
[00:54:56.690 --> 00:54:57.370]  We've gotten soft.
[00:54:57.370 --> 00:54:58.851]  We've gotten stupid.
[00:54:58.851 --> 00:54:59.871]  We've gotten dishonorable.
[00:55:00.831 --> 00:55:05.112]  It turned into just a bunch of trash, myself included, at certain levels.
[00:55:05.112 --> 00:55:08.552]  And so, nature abhors a vacuum.
[00:55:08.552 --> 00:55:09.953]  Out goes the good.
[00:55:09.953 --> 00:55:11.713]  In comes the bad, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:55:11.713 --> 00:55:15.153]  I mean, take that report I did yesterday.
[00:55:15.153 --> 00:55:17.174]  I was re-watching that last night.
[00:55:17.174 --> 00:55:20.194]  Where tens of thousands of children were placed with pedophiles.
[00:55:20.194 --> 00:55:23.835]  That's industrial level in Germany, knowingly, to destroy the family.
[00:55:23.835 --> 00:55:28.176]  And now the same groups are in Canada, taking foster children and giving them to these weirdos.
[00:55:28.176 --> 00:55:29.336]  They call it sex changes.
[00:55:29.656 --> 00:55:30.878]  You're not just going to have sex with your kids.
[00:55:30.878 --> 00:55:32.861]  They're going to cut their genitals off.
[00:55:32.861 --> 00:55:38.991]  And it's liberal and loving and trendy because you don't want the gay community to attack you if you're against chopping little boys' genitals off.
[00:55:38.991 --> 00:55:43.398]  I mean, this is just like a psycho movie on PCP and 14 hits of acid.
[00:55:43.398 --> 00:55:44.280]  Pull the right button.
[00:55:46.065 --> 00:55:47.967]  Again, I don't like to lecture people.
[00:55:47.967 --> 00:55:59.056]  I'm a very private person, but because of the globalists and their attack on humanity, I've been forced the last 27 years to be a public figure, and we've given the globalists one hell of a run for their money because of God.
[00:55:59.056 --> 00:56:03.019]  And I know some of our listeners get mad when I talk about God all day, but just give me a break.
[00:56:03.019 --> 00:56:04.480]  The Satanism's out in the open.
[00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:09.524]  I've always been a Christian, but now the fact that it's a fight between good and evil is so clear.
[00:56:09.524 --> 00:56:09.945]  And I get it.
[00:56:09.945 --> 00:56:11.706]  A lot of you have been turned off by big churches.
[00:56:11.706 --> 00:56:13.848]  A lot of you have been turned off by the corrupt.
[00:56:14.776 --> 00:56:15.217]  We're good to go.
[00:56:30.192 --> 00:56:32.074]  And so that's what InfoWars is really all about.
[00:56:32.074 --> 00:56:34.056]  So thank you all for your word of mouth.

[00:57:16.376 --> 00:57:17.917]  Krill oil is set to sell out.
[00:57:17.917 --> 00:57:18.958]  It's amazing as well.
[00:57:19.518 --> 00:57:25.322]  It's at 25% off, but when you get them both together in a combo, it's 50% off as well.

[00:57:49.568 --> 00:57:58.015]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:57:58.015 --> 00:58:11.365]  Maybe I didn't treat you quite as good as I should.
[00:58:11.365 --> 00:58:13.747]  Maybe I didn't love you
[00:58:17.947 --> 00:58:46.395]  Quite as often as I could Little things I should have said and done I just never took the time You were always on my mind You were always on my mind You were always on my mind You were always on my
[00:58:49.498 --> 00:58:53.802]  Welcome back to the Global Transmission.
[00:58:53.802 --> 00:58:57.785]  Alright, we got loaded phone lines here with people wanting to call in with their experiences with the vaccine.
[00:58:57.785 --> 00:58:58.725]  I'm not screening your calls.
[00:58:58.725 --> 00:58:59.606]  If you love it, tell me.
[00:58:59.606 --> 00:59:01.027]  If it didn't do anything, tell me.
[00:59:01.027 --> 00:59:07.492]  If it made you sick, or hurts somebody you know, or helps somebody you know, we'd love to hear from you.
[00:59:07.492 --> 00:59:18.501]  I gotta be honest with you, I ran into somebody that I've known for a long time, that I've worked with, yesterday, and I'd seen him just about a month ago, and he didn't look good.
[00:59:20.899 --> 00:59:24.961]  And he looked older and he seemed foggy.
[00:59:24.961 --> 00:59:28.942]  And his skin kind of had a way of hanging on his face.
[00:59:28.942 --> 00:59:32.044]  And I said, did you take the vaccine?
[00:59:32.044 --> 00:59:34.525]  Did you take the mRNA?
[00:59:34.525 --> 00:59:38.446]  And he said, yeah, I took the Moderna and so did my wife and so did my children.
[00:59:38.446 --> 00:59:44.869]  His children are grown up, recently married.
[00:59:44.869 --> 00:59:46.970]  I said, interesting, I didn't say you look like hell.
[00:59:51.198 --> 00:59:53.519]  And his father recently died.
[00:59:53.519 --> 00:59:54.559]  I couldn't help myself.
[00:59:54.559 --> 00:59:57.359]  I said, did your dad take it?
[00:59:57.359 --> 01:00:03.961]  And he said, no.
[01:00:03.961 --> 01:00:08.042]  Dad died of pneumonia.
[01:00:08.042 --> 01:00:09.842]  And you know, there are a lot of serious pneumonias out there.
[01:00:09.842 --> 01:00:12.282]  Actually, there's a lot more than the flu.
[01:00:12.282 --> 01:00:17.784]  But see, they can never make a vaccine for the pneumonia because it's a bunch of cold viruses that just get in your lungs.
[01:00:17.784 --> 01:00:19.444]  And if you did, it creates a protein
[01:00:20.245 --> 01:00:30.992]  That the rest of your body has and it starts attacking your body, which is what all these giant studies that I've got right here show me.
[01:00:30.992 --> 01:00:34.114]  You know, part of the reason my head's spinning is they bring me so many documents.
[01:00:34.114 --> 01:00:35.235]  They bring me so much proof.
[01:00:35.235 --> 01:00:37.556]  I'm going to go to your phone calls as we start the next segment.
[01:00:37.556 --> 01:00:38.797]  I don't want to cut anybody off.
[01:00:38.797 --> 01:00:40.698]  I appreciate folks holding.
[01:00:40.698 --> 01:00:45.541]  But I had those two studies here out at UT.
[01:00:45.541 --> 01:00:46.021]  Oh, there.
[01:00:46.021 --> 01:00:46.622]  They're in the stack.
[01:00:46.622 --> 01:00:46.782]  Good.
[01:00:48.346 --> 01:00:54.851]  And just that, just that, it's hard to cover anything else when you got that.
[01:00:54.851 --> 01:00:59.855]  I sent this to a individual I know that is high up in the board.
[01:00:59.855 --> 01:01:02.537]  Let's just say, well, I gave away too much didn't I?
[01:01:02.537 --> 01:01:07.901]  Let's say heads up at the Department of the University of Texas last night.
[01:01:07.901 --> 01:01:11.103]  And when I, I know this person for a long time.
[01:01:11.103 --> 01:01:14.866]  And when I send them text messages, they usually don't respond for like a week.
[01:01:14.866 --> 01:01:16.407]  But he responded back in about 20 minutes.
[01:01:17.805 --> 01:01:30.870]  And I said, hey, UT put out this big study under a federal government grant nine years ago that... And I said, tell me what you think of it.
[01:01:30.870 --> 01:01:40.333]  I didn't even say... They said it was bad, don't take COVID-based vaccines.
[01:01:40.333 --> 01:01:40.674]  This is 2012.
[01:01:40.674 --> 01:01:46.976]  I just said, hey, UT put out this interesting report on COVID-type viruses
[01:01:47.777 --> 01:01:51.000]  Nine years ago, what do you think?
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.401]  Hell, I'll show you the text.
[01:01:53.401 --> 01:01:54.903]  I won't show you the name.
[01:01:54.903 --> 01:02:09.053]  And he texted me back like 10 minutes later, and he said, well, it's very technical, but obviously, I'm not taking the vaccine, and this is a warning.
[01:02:09.053 --> 01:02:12.596]  And then he went on to tell me that his medical doctor told him don't take the vaccine.
[01:02:12.596 --> 01:02:14.818]  In fact, let me just show you the text.
[01:02:14.818 --> 01:02:16.319]  Because it's just so interesting that
[01:02:17.125 --> 01:02:24.491]  You know, they tell the general public everybody should do this, but here's somebody high up in the UT system, very respected, you know, one of the biggest universities in the world.
[01:02:24.491 --> 01:02:27.353]  Let me find it.
[01:02:27.353 --> 01:02:35.419]  Yeah, let me make sure you can't see the name on here.
[01:02:35.419 --> 01:02:38.081]  Go ahead and overhead shot real quick.
[01:02:38.081 --> 01:02:39.782]  Look at this.
[01:02:39.782 --> 01:02:40.423]  Overhead shot, please.
[01:02:41.781 --> 01:02:44.903]  My doctor recommended that I not get vaccinated.
[01:02:44.903 --> 01:02:47.845]  She said it had unnecessary risk associated with it.
[01:02:47.845 --> 01:02:54.289]  And because I already had a high level of antibodies from having had COVID, there was no need to take the risk.
[01:02:54.289 --> 01:03:04.455]  The article... Fourteen months ago, I told you that the global lockdown was going to kill tens of millions of people by starvation and was going to cause a global depression in the first world.
[01:03:04.455 --> 01:03:04.936]  And now it has.
[01:03:05.476 --> 01:03:12.539]  It was a no-brainer then that you should get high-quality, storable food and save it because it is insurance you can eat.
[01:03:12.539 --> 01:03:17.021]  And with all the inflation we knew was coming, that was one way to beat inflation.
[01:03:17.021 --> 01:03:18.042]  A lot of you listened.
[01:03:18.042 --> 01:03:19.102]  You did a great job.
[01:03:19.102 --> 01:03:20.103]  Some of you didn't.
[01:03:20.103 --> 01:03:24.484]  Now is the time to take action before food prices only continue to increase.
[01:03:24.484 --> 01:03:25.745]  Every index shows it.
[01:03:25.745 --> 01:03:28.806]  It's basically a guarantee barring a miracle.
[01:03:28.806 --> 01:03:30.307]  And we wish it wasn't the case.
[01:03:30.307 --> 01:03:32.268]  But let's make lemonade out of these lemons.
[01:03:32.808 --> 01:03:41.090]  For only a few days more until next Wednesday, May 12th, you can get 2020 prices still at preparewithalex.com.
[01:03:41.090 --> 01:03:48.352]  And then the prices are going to have to go back to what they were, still lower than most major competitors, and the food is the highest quality you're going to find.
[01:03:48.352 --> 01:03:50.333]  Preparewithalex.com.
[01:03:50.333 --> 01:03:51.333]  Take action now.
[01:03:51.333 --> 01:03:52.834]  Preparewithalex.com.
[01:03:52.834 --> 01:03:58.495]  Secure your food while you still can.
[01:03:58.495 --> 01:04:00.196]  Big Brother.
[01:04:00.196 --> 01:04:01.356]  Mainstream media.
[01:04:02.526 --> 01:04:04.286]  Government cover-ups.
[01:04:04.286 --> 01:04:06.387]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:04:06.387 --> 01:04:08.528]  Well, so does he.
[01:04:08.528 --> 01:04:22.551]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:04:22.551 --> 01:04:29.373]  Alright, I tend to start each broadcast in the last year and a few months, 14 months or so.
[01:04:30.353 --> 01:04:52.208]  With the martial law, with the COVID-19, with the checkpoints, with the lockdowns, with the police state, because it's the big globalist move, and tied to that is economic collapse, third world populations surging into our borders, universal incomes, just the whole new world order agenda of Agenda 21, Agenda 2030.
[01:04:52.208 --> 01:04:53.208]  It's the big enchilada.
[01:04:53.208 --> 01:04:55.710]  Everything comes out of the center of the wheel.
[01:04:55.710 --> 01:04:57.451]  Everything else is a spoke of that.
[01:04:57.451 --> 01:04:58.412]  This is their big move.
[01:04:59.952 --> 01:05:00.932]  But today I didn't do that.
[01:05:00.932 --> 01:05:05.734]  I started the broadcast with organized rioting around the world by communist forces.
[01:05:05.734 --> 01:05:19.400]  And after I take phone calls for everybody on the board, I'm going to get into incredible footage from all over the world of Antifa acting as police, pulling people out of cars, threatening them at gunpoint, and the police watching do nothing.
[01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:20.680]  This is anarchy.
[01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:21.881]  This is lawlessness.
[01:05:21.881 --> 01:05:23.741]  This is exactly what the left planned.
[01:05:23.741 --> 01:05:27.963]  Intimidate, bully the police so bad that if they do their job, they'll be put in prison.
[01:05:29.813 --> 01:05:33.554]  That they stand down and then the left can take over, then they'll get control of the police department.
[01:05:33.554 --> 01:05:36.175]  So, you watch this antiva footage we're going to be playing you.
[01:05:36.175 --> 01:05:38.836]  They're like, get out of the car!
[01:05:38.836 --> 01:05:39.436]  Put your hands up!
[01:05:39.436 --> 01:05:41.737]  I'm going to kill you right now if you don't!
[01:05:41.737 --> 01:05:46.879]  And they sound like out-of-control cops or cops that just stopped a bank robber.
[01:05:46.879 --> 01:05:52.161]  They've all been watching cop shows, but it's a bunch of woke, you know, leftists and trendies.
[01:05:53.599 --> 01:06:02.422]  Literally engaged in, like Al-Qaeda checkpoints, like Al-Qaeda sets these up in Afghanistan and Syria and stops people and does this and they beat him up and drag him away.
[01:06:02.422 --> 01:06:05.243]  I mean, it's the police stand and watch it.
[01:06:05.243 --> 01:06:09.345]  And then the guy pulls a gun and then the media is like, how dare him?
[01:06:09.345 --> 01:06:10.986]  And then while they beat him, they go, how dare you?
[01:06:10.986 --> 01:06:13.026]  How dare you?
[01:06:13.026 --> 01:06:14.967]  So it goes on and on.
[01:06:14.967 --> 01:06:15.647]  That's coming up.
[01:06:15.647 --> 01:06:20.389]  But let me hit this as I go to your calls.
[01:06:20.389 --> 01:06:22.610]  This is a University of Texas major study
[01:06:23.593 --> 01:06:24.914]  Financed by the federal government.
[01:06:24.914 --> 01:06:33.600]  They were trying to see if COVID family, SARS family, COVID-19 family viruses could be stopped with a vaccine.
[01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:35.802]  They found all the lab rats got sick.
[01:06:35.802 --> 01:06:41.486]  Many died in a major study with three different vaccine types.
[01:06:41.486 --> 01:06:42.267]  And that was in 2012.
[01:06:42.267 --> 01:06:45.629]  And they said, you shouldn't try to make a vaccine of this for humans.
[01:06:45.629 --> 01:06:46.990]  You should proceed with extreme caution.
[01:06:48.638 --> 01:06:59.007]  And that's titled, Immunization SARS Coronavirus Vaccine Leads to Pulmonary Immunopathology of Challenge with the SARS Virus.
[01:06:59.007 --> 01:07:04.993]  And the challenge is the group of rats that were given the vaccine versus those that aren't.
[01:07:04.993 --> 01:07:15.082]  And they developed autoimmune responses, and their hearts and lungs swell up, and they got bloody holes in them, and they died of blood clots, which I'm sure you're hearing about in the news.
[01:07:16.152 --> 01:07:22.475]  With all these so-called vaccines, they all make your body then attack a standard protein, attack itself.
[01:07:22.475 --> 01:07:24.056]  So that's one of the big things this is doing.
[01:07:24.056 --> 01:07:25.337]  It's not debatable.
[01:07:25.337 --> 01:07:26.898]  This is the smoking gun.
[01:07:26.898 --> 01:07:28.919]  It's posted, again, at InfoWars.com.
[01:07:28.919 --> 01:07:29.499]  I hope you share it.
[01:07:29.499 --> 01:07:31.540]  You can find it on the UT website for yourself.
[01:07:31.540 --> 01:07:34.262]  You can find it, a bunch of other studies that are similar.
[01:07:34.262 --> 01:07:35.422]  This is a well-known fact.
[01:07:35.422 --> 01:07:42.246]  It's how top scientists in December filed an emergency injunction with the EU begging them to stop this, citing other studies just like this.
[01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:49.081]  So this is like a well-known thing, like taking cyanide kills you, or smoking cigarettes gives you lung cancer.
[01:07:49.081 --> 01:07:52.762]  You take this stuff, it's going to give you autoimmune problems.
[01:07:52.762 --> 01:07:55.403]  Some people are really allergic to a bee sting, some aren't.
[01:07:55.403 --> 01:07:58.404]  Some are really allergic to this, some aren't.
[01:07:58.404 --> 01:08:03.906]  That's an oversimplification calling it allergic, but your body attacks itself.
[01:08:03.906 --> 01:08:12.008]  You become allergic to yourself and reject yourself, like you get an organ from somebody else, your body rejects it, unless you take anti-rejection drugs that lower your immune system.
[01:08:13.795 --> 01:08:16.357]  So they're making you sick for life, it's so diabolical.
[01:08:16.357 --> 01:08:23.903]  But I remember about two years ago, they introduced a bill, the Democrats did, and Frank Luntz supported it, it's like he supports OxyContin.
[01:08:23.903 --> 01:08:31.569]  And you can pull this up, they said, we want to get rid of inserts on vaccines, because they have fact sheets that lie to you.
[01:08:31.569 --> 01:08:33.851]  Oh, it's all safe, it's good, here's a fact sheet.
[01:08:33.851 --> 01:08:38.034]  But they have like Bible paper that's folded up in each little ampule of the vaccines by law.
[01:08:38.832 --> 01:08:43.573]  Since the 50s, that has all the animal studies, what it did, what they found.
[01:08:43.573 --> 01:08:46.434]  Yeah, there's a photo of one right there.
[01:08:46.434 --> 01:08:54.376]  And my gosh, if you get an MMR one or you get a hepatitis one, it says it can kill you, give you diabetes, give you Guillain-Barré, give you epilepsy, give you cancer.
[01:08:54.376 --> 01:08:58.376]  I mean, wow, it's scary.
[01:08:58.376 --> 01:09:00.317]  Made rats' autoimmune system shut down.
[01:09:00.317 --> 01:09:05.358]  I mean, MMR, it doesn't matter what they are, they all have just a laundry list of bad side effects.
[01:09:06.218 --> 01:09:07.919]  It's called The Devil Gives You Fine Print.
[01:09:07.919 --> 01:09:09.460]  Hey, don't read that fine print.
[01:09:09.460 --> 01:09:10.001]  Well, guess what?
[01:09:10.001 --> 01:09:11.061]  They've done that here.
[01:09:11.061 --> 01:09:12.663]  I didn't even realize this.
[01:09:12.663 --> 01:09:15.525]  We're going to show you the most incredible bombshell video.
[01:09:15.525 --> 01:09:19.788]  It's up on Infowars.com in the live show feed.
[01:09:19.788 --> 01:09:23.370]  Under my show, we're posting it there for you to find it.
[01:09:23.370 --> 01:09:26.492]  It's a totally sick joke.
[01:09:26.492 --> 01:09:28.594]  They didn't even not include it.
[01:09:28.594 --> 01:09:35.018]  Under the emergency authorization, because no studies were done, they give you a blank sheet of paper.
[01:09:35.018 --> 01:09:35.639]  So right now,
[01:09:36.508 --> 01:09:38.291]  By law, they're supposed to give you these.
[01:09:38.291 --> 01:09:40.414]  Rob, you are somebody that's assertive.
[01:09:40.414 --> 01:09:45.122]  Go to Walgreens or CVS and say, Hi, I'd like an insert.
[01:09:46.065 --> 01:09:46.926]  Of the vaccine.
[01:09:46.926 --> 01:09:48.087]  By law, you're supposed to give it to me.
[01:09:48.087 --> 01:09:51.190]  And they've got stacks of them in the trash can, because they're giving shots all day.
[01:09:51.190 --> 01:09:55.854]  They're probably in the trash outside, because they're giving them shots outside the window, you know.
[01:09:55.854 --> 01:09:57.756]  So just get me one now.
[01:09:57.756 --> 01:10:07.385]  I've got to show people this, because I made a call this morning and confirmed this is true with Moderna, Pfizer, J&J, all of it.
[01:10:09.815 --> 01:10:24.744]  For a little carton of milk, or orange juice, or apple juice, or grape juice, you've got the facts, and the nutrition, and the servings, and the carbohydrates, you know, it's got it all right there.
[01:10:24.744 --> 01:10:27.126]  The proteins, it has nothing!
[01:10:27.996 --> 01:10:30.739]  It has nothing!
[01:10:30.739 --> 01:10:33.701]  Oh, Snopes says it's safe and effective, totally tested.
[01:10:33.701 --> 01:10:36.564]  They're like, we need to take Tucker Carlson and Alex Jones off the air.
[01:10:36.564 --> 01:10:37.524]  They should be arrested.
[01:10:37.524 --> 01:10:39.026]  They're saying this isn't tested!
[01:10:39.026 --> 01:10:41.188]  Those liars!
[01:10:41.188 --> 01:10:45.371]  So ladies and gentlemen, I give you this incredible footage.
[01:10:45.371 --> 01:10:48.574]  Pharmacist shows COVID vaccine insert.
[01:10:48.574 --> 01:10:51.777]  It must be magic because the insert is blank.
[01:10:52.426 --> 01:10:54.608]  There's no paper trail to track the attack.
[01:10:54.608 --> 01:10:56.450]  No paper trail to see what they hit you with.
[01:10:56.450 --> 01:10:57.230]  No warning.
[01:10:57.230 --> 01:10:58.491]  And it's in the general public.
[01:10:58.491 --> 01:11:00.613]  So the genie's out of the bottle.
[01:11:00.613 --> 01:11:01.494]  Everybody gets real.
[01:11:01.494 --> 01:11:05.297]  You had to do this because people aren't going to know what hit them now.
[01:11:05.297 --> 01:11:06.638]  And it's cardiovascular.
[01:11:06.638 --> 01:11:07.019]  Here it is.
[01:11:07.019 --> 01:11:11.582]  All right.
[01:11:11.582 --> 01:11:19.870]  I'm going to make this video for you because I had to video it so that you'll believe me because, frankly, I didn't believe it myself.
[01:11:19.870 --> 01:11:20.010]  So...
[01:11:21.874 --> 01:11:30.359]  Here's a brand new, sealed, perfectly sealed, brand new box of the J&J vaccine.
[01:11:30.359 --> 01:11:45.027]  You can see here, I'm going to break this open, and perfectly on top is this perfectly normal package insert.
[01:11:58.598 --> 01:12:00.520]  It's a lot of safety and efficacy data.
[01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:21.216]  In fact, all of the normal information that we would find in a package insert, like the ingredients, that would all be found right here in the package insert.
[01:12:21.216 --> 01:12:27.421]  Must be magic.
[01:12:27.421 --> 01:12:28.042]  It's all blank.
[01:12:28.780 --> 01:12:29.382]  The whole thing.
[01:12:29.382 --> 01:12:32.689]  Except for this part.
[01:12:32.689 --> 01:12:38.000]  That's the only thing not blank.
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:38.561]  Are you kidding me?
[01:12:42.071 --> 01:12:43.753]  This is a new type of war.
[01:12:43.753 --> 01:12:45.134]  This is World War 4.
[01:12:45.134 --> 01:12:46.856]  The Cold War was World War 3.
[01:12:46.856 --> 01:12:49.839]  This is a biological depopulation war.
[01:12:49.839 --> 01:12:51.521]  Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates admit it.
[01:12:51.521 --> 01:12:53.043]  They hang out with Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:12:53.043 --> 01:12:54.905]  They all got caught with the pedophiles.
[01:12:54.905 --> 01:12:57.187]  They already had this plan down the road a few years.
[01:12:57.187 --> 01:13:04.055]  They launched the plan early as an emergency against us to totally change our view to the collapse.
[01:13:04.890 --> 01:13:07.052]  So warn your family, warn everyone now.
[01:13:07.052 --> 01:13:08.413]  They're lying to you.
[01:13:08.413 --> 01:13:10.055]  This is so out of control.
[01:13:10.055 --> 01:13:24.988]  We're going to go to break and I promise, Nicole and Brian, we're going to write to you and then everybody else like Creed and Nelson and John and Jeff and Ed and Charlene and Sarah, every one of you, bam, bam, bam, you're going to be able to tell your story to the world.
[01:13:24.988 --> 01:13:26.470]  But you just saw that incredible footage.
[01:13:27.091 --> 01:13:42.881]  That we're posting under the live show feed of today's live show with the headline up there about the fact that the globalists are imploding our planet and are waging war against us, but that there are ways to stop them.
[01:13:42.881 --> 01:13:47.584]  I'm Alex Jones, one of the main fighters in the human resistance against the globalists takeover.
[01:13:47.584 --> 01:13:49.005]  Thank you so much for your support.
[01:13:49.005 --> 01:13:49.585]  God bless you.
[01:13:49.585 --> 01:13:54.789]  We'll be right back on the other side.
[01:13:54.789 --> 01:13:56.450]  The equation is very simple.
[01:13:57.569 --> 01:14:07.169]  The mega banks control the media, they control big pharma, they control academia, they control the military, industrial complex, they control big tech.
[01:14:08.314 --> 01:14:17.416]  And everywhere that they have been in control in the third world, they have established absolute total despotism and dehumanization.
[01:14:17.416 --> 01:14:25.898]  It is the Western Christian idea of human freedom that ended slavery and that promoted women's rights and so much more that actually threatens them.
[01:14:25.898 --> 01:14:32.640]  So because they can't defeat that empowering ethic, they instead co-opt it, turn it upside down, and use
[01:14:33.500 --> 01:14:41.584]  The idea of equality to actually destroy human freedom and the free market that threatens their monopolies of control.
[01:14:41.584 --> 01:14:46.086]  That's why they target InfoWars, because we understand the keys to defeating them.
[01:14:46.086 --> 01:14:51.468]  But the only way our transmission gets out is if you promote InfoWars at man.video.
[01:14:51.468 --> 01:14:52.568]  So redouble your efforts.
[01:14:52.568 --> 01:14:53.489]  We're all in this together.
[01:14:54.551 --> 01:15:00.896]  What if you could cut your heating bills this winter with your existing wood-burning fireplace and not spend thousands doing it?

[01:15:55.445 --> 01:15:57.967]  It is a big idea.
[01:15:57.967 --> 01:16:01.870]  A new world order.
[01:16:01.870 --> 01:16:06.653]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:16:06.653 --> 01:16:09.615]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:16:09.615 --> 01:16:12.477]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:16:12.477 --> 01:16:14.899]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:16:15.798 --> 01:16:23.964]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:16:23.964 --> 01:16:26.626]  The globalists feared this film made 14 years ago.
[01:16:26.626 --> 01:16:28.847]  It is the blueprint for their plan to take over the world.
[01:16:28.847 --> 01:16:30.288]  It is the blueprint for the Great Reset.
[01:16:30.288 --> 01:16:31.349]  It is, in-game.
[01:16:31.349 --> 01:16:32.590]  Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[01:16:32.590 --> 01:16:38.614]  Available right now at InfoWarsTore.com with a zero country code, meaning you can make copies of it anywhere in the world.
[01:16:38.614 --> 01:16:42.397]  I strongly suggest you get the film in-game at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:16:42.837 --> 01:16:45.038]  I strongly suggest you make copies and share it.
[01:16:45.038 --> 01:16:50.420]  And if you take that action, I demand you tell others you've given a copy to that they make copies and share it as well.
[01:16:50.420 --> 01:16:55.983]  That will trigger distribution by proxy, meaning we the people cannot be stopped.
[01:16:55.983 --> 01:16:59.264]  So what's the most important part, let's say, in a bulldozer running over the Globalist?
[01:16:59.264 --> 01:17:02.725]  The treads, the wheels, the engine, the scoop on the front.
[01:17:02.725 --> 01:17:05.467]  It's all very important, but the fuel is paramount.
[01:17:05.467 --> 01:17:06.347]  And that's my allegory.
[01:17:07.412 --> 01:17:18.483]  TurboForce is vitamins, minerals, amino acids that synergistically work with six different natural forms of healthy, clean energy that last for 10 hours in the average metabolic system metabolism of a human.
[01:17:18.483 --> 01:17:20.805]  Some people get 15 hours of it, some people get about 8 hours.
[01:17:20.805 --> 01:17:26.551]  But people take this, people take it in sports, people cannot believe it's the best they've ever had because it's not hype.
[01:17:26.551 --> 01:17:28.713]  Nobody puts as much product into
[01:17:29.513 --> 01:17:30.514]  They're pre-workouts.
[01:17:30.514 --> 01:17:31.374]  They're post-workouts.
[01:17:31.374 --> 01:17:32.755]  You can call us whatever you want.
[01:17:32.755 --> 01:17:34.176]  It's a total solution.
[01:17:34.176 --> 01:17:35.476]  All around the best you're going to find.
[01:17:35.476 --> 01:17:36.477]  TurboForce.
[01:17:36.477 --> 01:17:38.738]  Without you, we don't roll.
[01:17:38.738 --> 01:17:40.439]  With you, we surge forward together.
[01:17:40.439 --> 01:17:42.480]  It's like the bulldozer without the diesel fuel.
[01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:45.101]  If we don't have your financial support, we will be defeated.
[01:17:45.101 --> 01:17:48.143]  You support us and get products you already need that literally fuel your body and your mind?
[01:17:48.143 --> 01:17:49.944]  It's a win-win.
[01:17:49.944 --> 01:17:50.604]  360 together.

[01:17:58.735 --> 01:18:01.376]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:18:37.285 --> 01:18:46.376]  So now, all the major vaccine makers with these mRNA frankenshots are not even putting
[01:18:57.990 --> 01:18:59.531]  On the inserts, anything.
[01:18:59.531 --> 01:19:03.414]  Not the ingredients, not any studies, not any testing, because it wasn't done.
[01:19:03.414 --> 01:19:04.814]  It's all blank, no paper trail.
[01:19:04.814 --> 01:19:08.697]  But, under other names, they did do the studies.
[01:19:08.697 --> 01:19:12.419]  They did do the test on a bunch of different coronaviruses.
[01:19:12.419 --> 01:19:18.303]  And here's the University of Texas, nine years ago, with the SARS coronavirus family, with rats.
[01:19:18.303 --> 01:19:21.045]  Three different vaccines, the rats died with blood clots.
[01:19:21.776 --> 01:19:29.778]  In their lungs, in their brains, in their hearts, and they say don't create vaccines for humans with this because it attacks proteins in the body.
[01:19:29.778 --> 01:19:38.941]  There are the facts, but there's no paper trail now because they won't even tell you what was ever in the shot, and they're fighting to keep that secret.
[01:19:38.941 --> 01:19:39.641]  Unbelievable.
[01:19:39.641 --> 01:19:41.241]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[01:19:41.241 --> 01:19:43.662]  Nicole, Brian, others.
[01:19:43.662 --> 01:19:45.183]  Nicole's husband is a nurse.
[01:19:45.183 --> 01:19:47.083]  Vaccine dangers.
[01:19:47.083 --> 01:19:49.524]  We also have Brian wants to talk about vaccine reactions.
[01:19:49.524 --> 01:19:50.204]  Sister's a doc.
[01:19:52.589 --> 01:19:56.412]  So, Nicole, thank you for holding with us and being here.
[01:19:56.412 --> 01:19:56.753]  Welcome.
[01:19:56.753 --> 01:19:58.754]  Tell us your view on this.
[01:19:58.754 --> 01:20:00.035]  Hi, Alex.
[01:20:00.035 --> 01:20:00.736]  Good to talk to you.
[01:20:00.736 --> 01:20:05.500]  This is a full circle moment for me because I grew up watching you on cable access in Austin.
[01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:09.282]  So, I just want to say God bless for giving you the strength to fight the good fight for so long.
[01:20:09.282 --> 01:20:10.003]  Well, God bless you.
[01:20:10.003 --> 01:20:11.124]  You're awesome.
[01:20:11.124 --> 01:20:11.564]  Yeah.
[01:20:11.564 --> 01:20:11.865]  Okay.
[01:20:11.865 --> 01:20:14.887]  So, I just wanted to preface this by saying that my husband's a nurse.
[01:20:14.887 --> 01:20:16.288]  He's a phenomenal nurse.
[01:20:16.288 --> 01:20:18.330]  He was nominated for Nurse of the Year at his hospital.
[01:20:18.330 --> 01:20:19.911]  He knows what he's talking about.
[01:20:20.513 --> 01:20:21.114]  Okay.
[01:20:21.114 --> 01:20:21.534]  Thank you.
[01:20:35.535 --> 01:20:44.177]  That the science behind vaccines isn't that credible, so we started talking to people about it and reading the inserts and talking about everything.
[01:20:44.177 --> 01:20:49.658]  Fast forward to today, my mother-in-law got the COVID Moderna shot.
[01:20:49.658 --> 01:20:54.439]  She doesn't believe us about any of this, even though her grandson almost died.
[01:20:54.439 --> 01:21:00.721]  And now she has a lipoma on her breast a week after vaccination, which is the post
[01:21:02.458 --> 01:21:28.711]  By the way they're telling people that you're gonna get what looks like breast cancer but it's okay and don't have an operation but women are going in and it's cancer and they admit in the uterus and the breast that's mainstream news that's been out six months in England now it's confirmed all over the world
[01:21:29.574 --> 01:21:32.458]  My God, this is like a nightmare injection!
[01:21:32.458 --> 01:21:33.659]  Right, right.
[01:21:33.659 --> 01:21:36.483]  What is she saying now that she has breast cancer?
[01:21:36.483 --> 01:21:38.165]  She's still pro-vaccine.
[01:21:38.165 --> 01:21:43.952]  She says that, yeah, the vaccine gave me the breast cancer, but I'm still pro-vaccine.
[01:21:43.952 --> 01:21:45.314]  It's very bizarre.
[01:21:45.314 --> 01:21:46.215]  It's very bizarre.
[01:21:46.215 --> 01:21:47.457]  Well, they've been programmed.
[01:21:47.457 --> 01:21:48.318]  What's happened is,
[01:21:49.150 --> 01:21:50.091]  They've been hypnotized.
[01:21:50.091 --> 01:21:54.093]  A lot of the public, scientifically, is not in a pure suggestive state.
[01:21:54.093 --> 01:21:56.374]  They're not purely hypnotized, but they're almost there.
[01:21:56.374 --> 01:21:58.295]  Kind of like in a daydream.
[01:21:58.295 --> 01:22:03.638]  And so, more and more, we've got to work on techniques to try to get people out of their trance.
[01:22:03.638 --> 01:22:05.319]  Well, here's the point I want to make.
[01:22:05.319 --> 01:22:07.661]  If you read, you're talking about insert.
[01:22:07.661 --> 01:22:17.226]  Insert 13.1 of any vaccine that you receive says this product has not been tested for carcinogenic, deuterogenic, or infertility effects.
[01:22:17.762 --> 01:22:21.384]  So you think of those three industries as individuals, right?
[01:22:21.384 --> 01:22:25.387]  Cancer, autoimmune disease, and fertility.
[01:22:25.387 --> 01:22:29.069]  Those are big businesses, especially if we're giving those shots to our children.
[01:22:29.069 --> 01:22:29.369]  That's right.
[01:22:29.369 --> 01:22:32.251]  Giving you cancer, giving you infertility, you're so smart.
[01:22:32.251 --> 01:22:40.056]  Explain that to people that there's nothing on the insert, they won't tell you what's in it, but hey, it might hurt your fertility, it might give you cancer, it might give you a heart attack.
[01:22:40.876 --> 01:22:49.160]  Right, but at least you don't get this random disease that you can easily recover from if you've ever really researched any of these vaccines.
[01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:49.900]  Which is worse?
[01:22:49.900 --> 01:22:51.601]  Your child getting cancer?
[01:22:51.601 --> 01:22:54.222]  Or your child... Well, that's why you gotta talk to everybody with a logic.
[01:22:54.222 --> 01:22:58.144]  What this lady's saying is the logic that can save millions of lives and stop the takeover.
[01:22:58.144 --> 01:22:59.245]  Because they're already announcing...
[01:23:00.326 --> 01:23:11.694]  That they're coming out with the booster shot that's a patch that then marks you and it's saying Pfizer scientists expect elderly people with underlying conditions to be first to get COVID vaccine boosters.
[01:23:11.694 --> 01:23:13.976]  And they say at least five shots a year.
[01:23:13.976 --> 01:23:15.597]  Then it'll be ten shots a year.
[01:23:15.597 --> 01:23:18.599]  This is a total takeover.
[01:23:18.599 --> 01:23:18.840]  Right.
[01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:22.983]  And I think what we're about to see is since they're starting to pass this bioweapon on children.
[01:23:22.983 --> 01:23:24.724]  It's not a vaccine, it's a bioweapon.
[01:23:24.724 --> 01:23:26.205]  It doesn't meet any of the criteria.
[01:23:26.656 --> 01:23:28.637]  For the normal vaccine.
[01:23:28.637 --> 01:23:41.647]  If people are going to give this to their children, knowing that these children have been pumped so it's more vaccines than any other generation, you're about to watch the deaths of children on a massive scale.
[01:23:41.647 --> 01:23:42.868]  I totally agree.
[01:23:42.868 --> 01:23:43.909]  Nicole, amazing.
[01:23:43.909 --> 01:23:44.789]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:23:44.789 --> 01:23:45.229]  I appreciate it.
[01:23:45.229 --> 01:23:46.811]  I'm going to go to Brian next.
[01:23:46.811 --> 01:23:52.675]  Listen, every listener needs to get this report that I'll have reposted in today's live show feed.
[01:23:54.688 --> 01:23:58.249]  And share it with everyone you know and the nurse showing the inserts blank.
[01:23:58.249 --> 01:23:59.189]  This is life and death.
[01:23:59.189 --> 01:24:02.670]  Your whole email list, your text messages, your friends, your family, your neighbors.
[01:24:02.670 --> 01:24:04.730]  Go to the local city council.
[01:24:04.730 --> 01:24:06.550]  Go to the local school board.
[01:24:06.550 --> 01:24:09.911]  Read just the first page of this.
[01:24:09.911 --> 01:24:16.072]  That any type of coronavirus vaccine and University of Texas Studies killed the rats with blood clots.
[01:24:16.072 --> 01:24:17.373]  Massive numbers.
[01:24:17.373 --> 01:24:19.933]  They said don't do it.
[01:24:19.933 --> 01:24:23.414]  Everybody's got to get this out.
[01:24:23.414 --> 01:24:24.294]  I'm going to drive around
[01:24:25.256 --> 01:24:29.658]  With an armored vehicle, because the left will attack you in Austin, and I'm going to bullhorn this.
[01:24:29.658 --> 01:24:32.459]  I'm posting it in the live show feed.
[01:24:32.459 --> 01:24:35.520]  It's also on InfoWars.com.
[01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:36.680]  All right, let's get another caller in.
[01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:37.781]  Brian, thank you for holding.
[01:24:37.781 --> 01:24:38.661]  You're a trooper.
[01:24:38.661 --> 01:24:40.101]  You're Austin from North Carolina.
[01:24:40.101 --> 01:24:40.462]  Go ahead.
[01:24:40.462 --> 01:24:42.462]  Hi, Alex.
[01:24:42.462 --> 01:24:44.723]  Pleasure to be on the first time caller.
[01:24:44.723 --> 01:24:46.184]  I will keep it short and brief.
[01:24:46.184 --> 01:24:47.724]  I know you're a busy man.
[01:24:47.724 --> 01:24:50.845]  So first off, my sister is a physical therapist.
[01:24:50.845 --> 01:24:52.346]  She was recently visiting.
[01:24:53.515 --> 01:25:10.202]  Her and my brother, who is also a pharmacist, both reported that they are seeing new patients weekly that present with paralysis in their limbs or neurodegenerative disease within 24 to 48 hours of receiving the shot.
[01:25:10.202 --> 01:25:10.642]  Incredible!
[01:25:10.642 --> 01:25:11.262]  Please continue.
[01:25:12.455 --> 01:25:27.110]  Okay, so on top of that, the way they have their reporting systems set up in these healthcare systems, they don't have a way to report the vaccine as being an effect of these symptoms because it's set up so they cannot report it that way.
[01:25:27.611 --> 01:25:32.572]  So, that's why you're not seeing as many reports of adverse effects.
[01:25:32.572 --> 01:25:38.294]  The VAERS is about the only thing to go off of, and the majority of people, I feel like, just really don't even know that that's there.
[01:25:38.294 --> 01:25:38.794]  Exactly.
[01:25:38.794 --> 01:25:40.274]  That's why they estimate it's probably 100 to 1.
[01:25:40.274 --> 01:25:42.515]  So, if you've got 4,000 deaths on VAERS, it's probably 100,000.
[01:25:47.083 --> 01:25:47.663]  Exactly.
[01:25:47.663 --> 01:25:53.866]  My other question, which I haven't really seen anybody talking about this, is vaccines are self-spreading.
[01:25:53.866 --> 01:26:00.790]  And there's been research into that, I'm sure you're well aware, over 20 years ago with Project Toast and the Apartheid government.
[01:26:01.607 --> 01:26:06.249]  There's been research on using vaccines as bioweapons.
[01:26:06.249 --> 01:26:07.469]  That's right.
[01:26:07.469 --> 01:26:09.310]  I forgot to get into that.
[01:26:09.310 --> 01:26:10.510]  I showed it on air last week.
[01:26:10.510 --> 01:26:11.770]  You guys reprint me.
[01:26:11.770 --> 01:26:16.272]  Just type in South Africa plan to use self-spreading vaccines as bioweapons.
[01:26:16.272 --> 01:26:17.372]  Operation Post.
[01:26:17.372 --> 01:26:18.493]  Yes.
[01:26:18.493 --> 01:26:28.896]  So my question is, if these vaccines are self-spreading, is avoiding the shot really enough to avoid what is essentially a medical rape of your protein synthesis?
[01:26:30.580 --> 01:26:38.384]  That's why I think if you have really powerful vitamins and minerals, it won't be able to replicate as much in the mitochondria, and that's just speculation.
[01:26:38.384 --> 01:26:40.625]  We know you have to have that or the virus is going to leg up.
[01:26:40.625 --> 01:26:44.748]  This is synthetic biology, so I don't know.
[01:26:44.748 --> 01:26:46.629]  I'll get some scientists on, but yeah.
[01:26:46.629 --> 01:26:48.750]  This is a plague of Satan.
[01:26:48.750 --> 01:26:49.570]  God bless you, sir.
[01:26:49.570 --> 01:26:50.471]  Brian, thank you.

[01:26:54.162 --> 01:26:58.505]  All of the experts agree that getting proper sleep is the cornerstone of good health.
[01:26:58.505 --> 01:27:09.113]  It has been proven that a poor sleep schedule is linked with numerous health problems, including weight gain, memory issues, mood changes, poor concentration, and even a weakened immune system.
[01:27:09.113 --> 01:27:15.298]  Introducing RocketRest, the new product from our Dr. Jones Naturals line at InfowarsStore.com.

[01:27:23.844 --> 01:27:33.926]  Many competitors sleep formulas focus only on getting you to sleep, but Rocket Rest was specifically formulated to help you feel rested and ready to take on the next day.
[01:27:33.926 --> 01:27:41.747]  It uses a unique quick release capsule system to ensure fast delivery of deep sleep support ingredients like melatonin and magnesium.

[01:27:54.088 --> 01:28:02.771]  Listeners have rightfully been complaining the last six months or so saying, where are most of the best selling products you have that we love?
[01:28:02.771 --> 01:28:05.012]  And my answer is the supply chain has broken down.
[01:28:05.012 --> 01:28:09.294]  I have to either reformulate or I have to lower the quality to get a lot of these.
[01:28:09.294 --> 01:28:11.675]  And so that's why we don't have a lot of products in.
[01:28:11.675 --> 01:28:15.936]  That's why InfoWars is in financial trouble is because if we had the product, you would be buying it.
[01:28:15.936 --> 01:28:17.037]  We have the money.
[01:28:17.037 --> 01:28:20.938]  But so many of them have been sold out, just like you notice a lot of other items at the store.
[01:28:21.258 --> 01:28:21.658]  We're good to go.
[01:28:40.368 --> 01:28:41.589]  Take advantage of this now.
[01:28:41.589 --> 01:28:42.149]  Stock up.
[01:28:42.149 --> 01:28:43.230]  And don't forget to take your X2.
[01:28:43.230 --> 01:28:47.232]  Because I have a tendency to forget how great it is and not take it myself.
[01:28:47.232 --> 01:28:50.934]  But when I do, stamina, libido, energy, weight loss, it's incredible.
[01:28:50.934 --> 01:28:51.814]  It's essential.
[01:28:51.814 --> 01:28:53.455]  It's X2 at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:28:53.988 --> 01:29:02.474]  We here at InfoWars are proud to announce the first ever Kava Kava Root Supplement that is now available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:29:02.474 --> 01:29:13.021]  Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural health world today, though it has been used for hundreds of years in the Pacific Islands for its relaxation and euphoric effects.
[01:29:13.021 --> 01:29:22.667]  According to ancient Samoan legend, Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa, who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[01:29:23.007 --> 01:29:28.974]  The Samoan people would drink kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to loosen up a little.
[01:29:28.974 --> 01:29:33.839]  Nowadays, kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[01:29:33.839 --> 01:29:43.450]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only kava kava, but other herbs including, but not limited to, German chamomile,
[01:29:43.710 --> 01:29:45.592]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:30:34.562 --> 01:30:40.967]  Where the mountains stop, let us put good lies.
[01:30:40.967 --> 01:30:48.412]  John the Revelator, he's a smooth operator, it's time we cut him down to size.
[01:30:48.412 --> 01:30:55.057]  Take him by the hand, put him on the stand, let us hear his sacrifice.
[01:30:55.057 --> 01:30:59.460]  By claiming God, that is all you're on, you're stealing
[01:31:00.126 --> 01:31:03.948]  A three-year-old would know that this is the best mode song is a lie.
[01:31:03.948 --> 01:31:07.669]  Christians stole God from the Muslims?
[01:31:07.669 --> 01:31:10.791]  What the hell does that mean?
[01:31:10.791 --> 01:31:15.913]  But again, Satan hates Christ.
[01:31:15.913 --> 01:31:17.234]  Amazing.
[01:31:17.234 --> 01:31:23.357]  Christianity predates Islam by 400 years.
[01:31:23.357 --> 01:31:23.917]  Amazing.
[01:31:23.917 --> 01:31:26.358]  But the left sycophantically loves Islam.
[01:31:27.156 --> 01:31:32.500]  Because it'll be the authoritarian sword, they believe, that slits the throat of Europe and the United States.
[01:31:32.500 --> 01:31:35.102]  Welcome back, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:31:35.102 --> 01:31:42.228]  Since the caller mentioned it, well, two callers, both of which have family that are medical workers, about people coming in paralyzed from the vaccines.
[01:31:42.228 --> 01:31:46.391]  They all know it, but there's no way for hospitals to report it.
[01:31:46.391 --> 01:31:50.134]  The people have to report it themselves, and hospitals tell them don't do it.
[01:31:50.134 --> 01:31:52.877]  And another caller mentioned the same thing's happening at the hospitals.
[01:31:52.877 --> 01:31:53.357]  Look at this.
[01:31:53.357 --> 01:31:55.519]  Apartheid-era South African
[01:31:56.405 --> 01:31:58.407]  Covert program.
[01:31:58.407 --> 01:31:59.247]  Project Coast.
[01:31:59.247 --> 01:32:01.849]  Swap to weaponized vaccines.
[01:32:01.849 --> 01:32:03.791]  Could COVID-19 be used the same way?
[01:32:03.791 --> 01:32:05.392]  Vaccinedesk.com.
[01:32:05.392 --> 01:32:17.381]  Well, Israel actually bought this project, what was the other one called, Project Green, from the South Africans and tried to use it on the Palestinians.
[01:32:17.381 --> 01:32:18.842]  I mean, that's just a fact.
[01:32:18.842 --> 01:32:22.485]  Whether you like Israel, hate Israel, or neutral on it, this goes on.
[01:32:23.693 --> 01:32:30.574]  And governments, the Russians got caught testing on their people, the Chinese do it constantly, England does it, the Germans did it, the U.S.
[01:32:30.574 --> 01:32:37.955]  is famous for it, and we're just supposed to just trust them when the vaccine inserts are blank because they're not vaccines.
[01:32:37.955 --> 01:32:39.336]  You're like, well, how do they get away with it?
[01:32:39.336 --> 01:32:40.476]  It's all a giant test.
[01:32:40.476 --> 01:32:47.477]  They get the media on board, the doctors on board at the top, and now they've all committed a crime.
[01:32:47.477 --> 01:32:51.638]  Joseph Goebbels called that and Heinrich Himmler called that the cement of blood.
[01:32:51.638 --> 01:32:52.818]  Those are the right hand men of Hitler.
[01:32:55.123 --> 01:32:58.965]  Hammond-Guerin was like a side-side note.
[01:32:58.965 --> 01:33:06.110]  And they said, we get our men to commit these atrocities at first, and once they've been corrupted, they'll do anything we tell them.
[01:33:06.110 --> 01:33:08.891]  It's called the cement of blood.
[01:33:08.891 --> 01:33:20.438]  Like any gang, why does a gang, whether it's a white supremacist gang or a Hispanic gang, whatever the gang is, motorcycle gang, that's a, you know, 3% or 1% or whatever you call them.
[01:33:20.438 --> 01:33:24.541]  I don't mean a 3% or like the start of the Revolutionary War and wanted, I mean, you know, small percent that are outlaw motorcycle gangs.
[01:33:25.307 --> 01:33:27.488]  Criminal gangs.
[01:33:27.488 --> 01:33:36.512]  You gotta go kill somebody to be even in the club, and you gotta do something really bad to be a higher level member, because the higher levels you didn't know, they got dirt on your ass.
[01:33:36.512 --> 01:33:40.373]  And that's all this is, is a commitment into pure hell.
[01:33:40.373 --> 01:33:45.276]  I mean, you talk about a crime, folks, and now they're gonna... It's one thing to kill the old people.
[01:33:45.276 --> 01:33:46.616]  You know, there's an argument there.
[01:33:46.616 --> 01:33:53.219]  I don't support it, but the left says, you know, the case for killing Granny, Ezekiel Emanuel that wrote Obamacare says we're not gonna give old people health care.
[01:33:53.835 --> 01:33:55.276]  Arguing about eye surgery, knee surgery.
[01:33:55.276 --> 01:33:56.097]  He laughs about it.
[01:33:56.097 --> 01:33:56.777]  Because he's liberal.
[01:33:56.777 --> 01:33:58.018]  And so, we're going to hurt old people.
[01:33:58.018 --> 01:33:59.379]  I'm liberal.
[01:33:59.379 --> 01:33:59.919]  I'm liberal.
[01:33:59.919 --> 01:34:02.861]  It's alright, you know.
[01:34:02.861 --> 01:34:05.603]  The ADL will get you if you don't like it.
[01:34:05.603 --> 01:34:06.644]  George Soros is a Nazi.
[01:34:06.644 --> 01:34:10.467]  Well, the ADL will get you if you say it.
[01:34:10.467 --> 01:34:11.507]  So, that's how this works.
[01:34:11.507 --> 01:34:12.648]  I'm going back to your phone calls.
[01:34:12.648 --> 01:34:15.970]  These people are sick.
[01:34:15.970 --> 01:34:19.693]  And now they're going to target the little children and mess them up for life.
[01:34:19.693 --> 01:34:20.794]  Oh, man.
[01:34:20.794 --> 01:34:21.094]  Wow.
[01:34:22.188 --> 01:34:26.589]  I'm like, oh, suddenly all these kids have heart problems and have brain problems?
[01:34:26.589 --> 01:34:30.990]  Well, hasn't so conspiracy theorists say it's connected to the vaccine?
[01:34:30.990 --> 01:34:34.151]  Uh, no, the University of Texas says don't do it, it'll happen.
[01:34:34.151 --> 01:34:39.712]  But you don't care that young rats and old rats got sick and died?
[01:34:39.712 --> 01:34:42.232]  Because you're liberal.
[01:34:42.232 --> 01:34:45.013]  You're saving the earth for yourselves.
[01:34:45.013 --> 01:34:46.313]  All right, who's been holding the longest here?
[01:34:46.313 --> 01:34:48.254]  I really appreciate everybody holding.
[01:34:48.254 --> 01:34:49.034]  Is it Ed?
[01:34:49.034 --> 01:34:49.694]  Is it Jeff?
[01:34:52.702 --> 01:34:55.123]  Let's just go in the order they're received here.
[01:34:55.123 --> 01:34:56.143]  Let's just go to Jeff in New York.
[01:34:56.143 --> 01:34:56.803]  Thanks for holding, Jeff.
[01:34:56.803 --> 01:34:58.044]  Go ahead.
[01:34:58.044 --> 01:34:59.764]  Alex, hopefully you can hear me.
[01:34:59.764 --> 01:35:02.405]  This is Jeff in Long Island, New York.
[01:35:02.405 --> 01:35:05.026]  I'm about 20 miles outside of Manhattan.
[01:35:05.026 --> 01:35:21.811]  I just want to preface this by saying thank you, Professor Jones, for providing us with really an invaluable education, your coverage of geopolitics, economics, even just-in-time inventory, supply chain concerns, fiat currency issues, skyrocketing commodities.
[01:35:22.692 --> 01:35:31.337]  I personally work in the financial industry with a finance undergrad, and I'm working on an MBA, and your education is truly unbeatable in comparison.
[01:35:31.337 --> 01:35:41.943]  So yeah, long story short, my girlfriend of six years, it's our anniversary today, and we just heard that we're having our first baby.
[01:35:41.943 --> 01:35:43.184]  And long story short,
[01:35:43.669 --> 01:35:49.134]  Her Israeli gynecologist is recommending that she gets a vaccine in the second trimester.
[01:35:49.134 --> 01:35:56.661]  So as soon as I heard that really my heart sank and my reaction was we can never see this doctor again and really no way in hell.
[01:35:56.661 --> 01:36:07.451]  Especially since her uncle just a couple weeks ago got his first vaccination and within an hour if he had a heart attack and he was ushered off to the emergency room within an hour after the shot.
[01:36:09.113 --> 01:36:12.295]  Sir, not only can you not use that doctor, you've got to go public.
[01:36:12.295 --> 01:36:13.856]  You're doing it now on air.
[01:36:13.856 --> 01:36:14.597]  You've done it.
[01:36:14.597 --> 01:36:15.778]  You're a leader.
[01:36:15.778 --> 01:36:16.899]  Everybody's a leader.
[01:36:16.899 --> 01:36:21.422]  And just warn as many people as you can because, you know, we're tough as hard-working people.
[01:36:21.422 --> 01:36:25.425]  They know conservatives and patriots and nationalists aren't going to complain about stuff.
[01:36:25.425 --> 01:36:28.667]  But everyone I know has family getting sick from the shots.
[01:36:28.667 --> 01:36:32.670]  So we've got to get this information and explain to them it's not going to be on the nightly news.
[01:36:34.827 --> 01:36:36.348]  It's actually pointing towards Israel.
[01:36:36.348 --> 01:36:38.210]  Oh, Israel's totally got it under control.
[01:36:38.210 --> 01:36:39.351]  Look what they're doing.
[01:36:39.351 --> 01:36:41.393]  They're giving it to pregnant women.
[01:36:41.393 --> 01:36:45.656]  And I said, you really have no concept of really what's going on.
[01:36:45.656 --> 01:36:47.958]  You're just repeating pure propaganda.
[01:36:47.958 --> 01:36:51.341]  Oh, I know a lady from New Zealand and I told her, I said, take your mask off.
[01:36:51.341 --> 01:36:52.382]  And I've known her for a while.
[01:36:52.382 --> 01:36:52.783]  And she goes, no.
[01:36:53.689 --> 01:36:54.209]  What's going on, Alex?
[01:36:54.209 --> 01:36:55.090]  One second, I'll pull up.
[01:37:21.641 --> 01:37:22.521]  Good to talk to you, brother.
[01:37:22.521 --> 01:37:23.582]  Go ahead.
[01:37:23.582 --> 01:37:27.663]  Yeah, man, I just wanted to touch base on the symptoms because I know four people personally.
[01:37:27.663 --> 01:37:30.584]  A buddy of mine, he's a firefighter, another person at EMT.
[01:37:30.584 --> 01:37:44.448]  This teacher I know, she told me that her symptoms felt synthetic, which was very interesting to hear, meaning that she had all the symptoms minus congestion, kind of like the flu.
[01:37:44.448 --> 01:37:49.430]  And it's just interesting to hear that everybody that gets the second shot, that they're horribly sick.
[01:37:50.123 --> 01:37:54.006]  The firefighter dude that I know said that he felt like crap.
[01:37:54.006 --> 01:38:02.052]  Like I said, I saw somebody I've been in business with for 10 years and I saw him a month ago and I saw him and I was like, I didn't want to say you look like hell.
[01:38:02.052 --> 01:38:05.255]  And he just took, he got his second shot last week.
[01:38:05.255 --> 01:38:06.456]  He didn't get sick from it.
[01:38:06.456 --> 01:38:09.438]  He just looks like he's 10 years older.
[01:38:09.438 --> 01:38:10.299]  Wow.
[01:38:10.299 --> 01:38:10.519]  Yeah.
[01:38:10.519 --> 01:38:12.481]  I know the other gentleman, he's 55 years old.
[01:38:12.481 --> 01:38:13.541]  He got his second shot.
[01:38:13.541 --> 01:38:15.103]  He was put out for like a week.
[01:38:15.103 --> 01:38:17.084]  His wife, same thing.
[01:38:17.084 --> 01:38:18.305]  And my dad, he's what, 68 now?
[01:38:19.747 --> 01:38:22.430]  You know, I'm kind of asking him, Hey, are you thinking about getting a shot?
[01:38:22.430 --> 01:38:23.691]  He's like, Oh, I'm not sure.
[01:38:23.691 --> 01:38:28.535]  And, you know, thanks to you guys, I get to send all this information to him.
[01:38:28.535 --> 01:38:39.105]  It's not so, uh, can you say, I can't say educated, but just brainwashed, I guess you could say, you know, and I just also wanted to make a plug as well with the products.
[01:38:39.105 --> 01:38:42.908]  Body's definitely helped me out and on it for about almost a year now.
[01:38:42.908 --> 01:38:44.650]  And, uh, my, my shoulder pain is gone.
[01:38:45.438 --> 01:38:51.153]  Which is pretty awesome and I remember buying three months of storable food from you guys and also I got the Alexa Pure.
[01:38:52.403 --> 01:38:54.365]  Well, brother, you're not just on bodies.
[01:38:54.365 --> 01:38:55.266]  You are on the air.
[01:38:55.266 --> 01:38:59.410]  You are funding us to be on air and just keep bombarding your family.
[01:38:59.410 --> 01:39:03.373]  They're good people, so they project the goodness onto the evil globalists.
[01:39:03.373 --> 01:39:04.514]  Keep informing your dad.
[01:39:04.514 --> 01:39:07.997]  Keep waking him up and point out, hey, dad, they even say you got to keep wearing the mask.
[01:39:07.997 --> 01:39:08.718]  It doesn't protect you.
[01:39:08.718 --> 01:39:11.140]  And now there's the booster shot.
[01:39:11.140 --> 01:39:13.142]  And so just just just just keep hammering them.
[01:39:13.142 --> 01:39:13.702]  God bless you.
[01:39:13.702 --> 01:39:14.763]  I appreciate your call.
[01:39:14.763 --> 01:39:16.444]  OK, here's what's going to happen.
[01:39:16.444 --> 01:39:17.005]  I'm going to take
[01:39:17.620 --> 01:39:22.468]  In this next 10 and a half minute segment, or 10 minutes, 50 seconds long, I'm going to take nine calls.
[01:39:22.468 --> 01:39:23.910]  So I'm not going to tell you thanks for calling.
[01:39:23.910 --> 01:39:24.631]  Don't tell me thanks.
[01:39:24.631 --> 01:39:26.715]  I want to get your testimony on air.
[01:39:26.715 --> 01:39:28.037]  We're going to go to break.
[01:39:28.037 --> 01:39:31.162]  And I'm going to go directly to your calls to Creed.
[01:39:32.362 --> 01:39:38.305]  Uh, and then Sarah, and then right down the line, I'm gonna get to at least nine of your calls.
[01:39:38.305 --> 01:39:41.507]  I'll give each caller about a minute, twenty or so.
[01:39:41.507 --> 01:39:42.887]  And I really appreciate you all for calling.
[01:39:42.887 --> 01:39:45.409]  I just want to get you all on air, not have you sit there.
[01:39:45.409 --> 01:39:46.969]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[01:39:46.969 --> 01:39:53.833]  Tomorrow's news today, please stay with us.
[01:39:53.833 --> 01:39:56.654]  The equation is very simple.
[01:39:56.654 --> 01:39:58.275]  The mega banks control the media.
[01:39:58.275 --> 01:40:00.276]  They control big pharma.
[01:40:00.276 --> 01:40:01.677]  They control academia.
[01:40:02.828 --> 01:40:16.496]  They control the military, industrial complex, they control big tech, and everywhere that they have been in control in the third world, they have established absolute total despotism and dehumanization.
[01:40:16.496 --> 01:40:24.961]  It is the Western Christian idea of human freedom that ended slavery and that promoted women's rights and so much more that actually threatens them.
[01:40:24.961 --> 01:40:31.705]  So because they can't defeat that empowering ethic, they instead co-opt it, turn it upside down, and use
[01:40:32.565 --> 01:40:34.947]  Your brain, your heart, your bones, your liver, your eyes, everything!
[01:41:00.934 --> 01:41:04.837]  Has a better shot at surviving in this crazy environment when you have high quality fish oil.

[01:41:54.446 --> 01:42:03.793]  Fourteen months ago, I told you that the global lockdown was going to kill tens of millions of people by starvation and was going to cause a global depression in the first world.
[01:42:03.793 --> 01:42:04.854]  And now it has.
[01:42:04.854 --> 01:42:11.899]  It was a no-brainer then that you should get high-quality, storable food and save it because it is insurance you can eat.
[01:42:11.899 --> 01:42:16.382]  And with all the inflation we knew was coming, that was one way to beat inflation.
[01:42:16.382 --> 01:42:17.403]  A lot of you listened.
[01:42:17.403 --> 01:42:18.483]  You did a great job.
[01:42:18.483 --> 01:42:19.104]  Some of you didn't.
[01:42:19.444 --> 01:42:23.827]  Now is the time to take action before food prices only continue to increase.
[01:42:23.827 --> 01:42:25.108]  Every index shows it.
[01:42:25.108 --> 01:42:28.170]  It's basically a guarantee, barring a miracle.
[01:42:28.170 --> 01:42:29.671]  And we wish it wasn't the case.
[01:42:29.671 --> 01:42:32.173]  But let's make lemonade out of these lemons.
[01:42:32.173 --> 01:42:40.478]  For only a few days more, until next Wednesday, May 12th, you can get 2020 prices still at preparewithalex.com.
[01:42:40.478 --> 01:42:47.303]  And then the prices are going to have to go back to what they were, still lower than most major competitors, and the food is the highest quality you're going to find.
[01:42:47.703 --> 01:42:49.685]  PrepareWithAlex.com.
[01:42:49.685 --> 01:42:50.686]  Take action now.
[01:42:50.686 --> 01:42:52.188]  PrepareWithAlex.com.
[01:42:52.188 --> 01:42:53.549]  Secure your food while you still can.
[01:42:54.495 --> 01:42:57.896]  I am a very humble person, but I'm also a bold person.
[01:42:57.896 --> 01:43:07.797]  And so, as bad as things are with the globalists attacking humanity, with all the terrible things that are unfolding, I want you to know that a lot of positive things are happening as well.
[01:43:07.797 --> 01:43:11.158]  I'm a public figure, so I get to see things the general public doesn't get to see.
[01:43:11.158 --> 01:43:22.740]  And let me tell you, whether it's police chiefs, or members of Congress, or even folks in Hollywood, or mainstream media, or industry, people are really, really awake in the establishment.
[01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:28.243]  They don't want to go along with the globalists, but they're scared, they're looking for leadership.
[01:43:28.243 --> 01:43:30.345]  Well, that's where InfoWars comes in.
[01:43:30.345 --> 01:43:34.668]  You fund us, you support InfoWarsTore.com, you get great products to you at the same time.
[01:43:34.668 --> 01:43:44.334]  We will then go out and do what the globalists say is unpopular, what the globalists will target you for, to show people that it's safe to tell the truth and to take the heat.
[01:43:44.334 --> 01:43:51.699]  That's our job, so please, keep us on air so we can hit the barbed wire, so we can be the shock groups in the information war.
[01:43:52.199 --> 01:43:57.282]  Find us at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:43:57.282 --> 01:43:59.883]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:44:12.009 --> 01:44:14.071]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here, back live.
[01:44:14.071 --> 01:44:16.233]  I am trying to alarm you.
[01:44:16.233 --> 01:44:16.913]  I'm alarmed.
[01:44:16.913 --> 01:44:20.116]  This is moving so much faster than I even thought it was.
[01:44:20.116 --> 01:44:23.238]  People say, you know, tomorrow's news today, and we're usually way ahead of the curve.
[01:44:23.238 --> 01:44:27.122]  I thought they'd do a major beta test before a huge bio attack.
[01:44:27.122 --> 01:44:29.924]  But it looks like this is the big attack.
[01:44:29.924 --> 01:44:33.567]  Or I can't imagine how big the next one will be, because, I mean, this is a degenerative thing.
[01:44:33.567 --> 01:44:35.709]  This is already killing masses of people.
[01:44:35.709 --> 01:44:40.092]  You're going to see, I predict, in 2021, 2022, record death rates across the world.
[01:44:40.092 --> 01:44:40.773]  It's already happening.
[01:44:42.100 --> 01:44:48.465]  I personally am drinking more water, I'm getting more sun, and I'm taking my supplements that are absolutely essential.
[01:44:48.465 --> 01:44:50.766]  X2 is deep earth crystal iodine.
[01:44:50.766 --> 01:44:52.227]  It's essential in the body.
[01:44:52.227 --> 01:44:54.609]  So many people are deficient in iodine.
[01:44:54.609 --> 01:44:57.291]  Your mental clarity, your libido, your whole body.
[01:44:57.291 --> 01:44:59.432]  X2 back in stock, 50% off.
[01:44:59.432 --> 01:45:00.893]  Everybody should get it.
[01:45:00.893 --> 01:45:03.035]  TurboForce, 10 hours of clean energy.
[01:45:03.035 --> 01:45:03.735]  Back in stock, 40% off.
[01:45:04.896 --> 01:45:06.437]  Okay, let's go ahead and talk to
[01:45:34.199 --> 01:45:39.061]  John in Kentucky, go ahead.
[01:45:39.061 --> 01:45:41.222]  Hey Alex, long time listener.
[01:45:41.222 --> 01:45:43.923]  God bless you.
[01:45:43.923 --> 01:45:57.710]  What's mind-blowing is because these vaccines was pushed through by emergency use, the vaccine manufacturers do not have to disclose the ingredients.
[01:45:57.710 --> 01:45:59.831]  That's what people don't understand.
[01:45:59.831 --> 01:46:02.792]  If it was actually FDA approved, then they would have
[01:46:03.345 --> 01:46:07.067]  To disclose the ingredients in the vaccines.
[01:46:07.067 --> 01:46:09.569]  And then John Oliver lies and says it's all tested.
[01:46:09.569 --> 01:46:12.851]  No one's ever gotten sick when it's all a giant lie.
[01:46:12.851 --> 01:46:14.632]  Yeah, yes, exactly.
[01:46:14.632 --> 01:46:17.074]  And also my wife's father.
[01:46:17.074 --> 01:46:19.175]  He's 54 healthy.
[01:46:19.175 --> 01:46:26.060]  We warned him against the vaccine taking any of them two days after his second dose of the Moderna.
[01:46:26.778 --> 01:46:30.881]  He was admitted into the ICU bleeding out internally somewhere.
[01:46:30.881 --> 01:46:33.403]  The doctors couldn't figure it out.
[01:46:33.403 --> 01:46:36.765]  I mean, this is uncharted waters we're dealing with here.
[01:46:36.765 --> 01:46:40.368]  Long story short, his kidneys were failing.
[01:46:40.368 --> 01:46:43.770]  Now he's on dialysis permanently.
[01:46:43.770 --> 01:46:48.313]  And my uncle, he just remarried his new wife's mother.
[01:46:50.649 --> 01:47:02.194]  They both got their vaccine back in February and she just passed away last week of a heart attack, but they're not putting two and two together and linking it with the vaccine.
[01:47:02.194 --> 01:47:02.894]  And it seems like
[01:47:04.401 --> 01:47:11.005]  Right now, when I'm scrolling through social media, somebody's sibling or grandparent or mother is sick and dying.
[01:47:11.005 --> 01:47:14.507]  And then Facebook shuts it down, and that's the real crime.
[01:47:14.507 --> 01:47:16.128]  And they will pay for what they've done.
[01:47:16.128 --> 01:47:17.308]  Absolutely, sir.
[01:47:17.308 --> 01:47:19.149]  Everybody has to tell their stories.
[01:47:19.149 --> 01:47:20.290]  Everybody's got to warn people.
[01:47:20.290 --> 01:47:21.130]  And you're doing it right now.
[01:47:21.130 --> 01:47:22.711]  God bless you for holding to do that, John.
[01:47:22.711 --> 01:47:23.111]  I got to move quick.
[01:47:23.111 --> 01:47:24.212]  We're going to get to everybody.
[01:47:24.212 --> 01:47:25.513]  And we're just taking calls.
[01:47:25.513 --> 01:47:27.273]  Unscreened here, folks.
[01:47:27.273 --> 01:47:29.815]  If you've got a great vaccine story, call and let us know.
[01:47:29.815 --> 01:47:31.296]  Oh, what's the UT study say?
[01:47:31.296 --> 01:47:31.876]  Bleeding out.
[01:47:32.529 --> 01:47:35.110]  Your body eating holes in your cardiovascular system.
[01:47:35.110 --> 01:47:36.490]  And what are they calling in with?
[01:47:36.490 --> 01:47:38.291]  Bleeding out.
[01:47:38.291 --> 01:47:39.491]  Unbelievable.
[01:47:39.491 --> 01:47:44.313]  Bill Gates, they're committing a crime so horrible, they think you won't admit it happened to you because you wouldn't.
[01:47:44.313 --> 01:47:47.554]  It's just too horrible that the government and Big Pharma would do this.
[01:47:47.554 --> 01:47:50.215]  But they have a long history of it.
[01:47:50.215 --> 01:47:51.215]  Creed in Oklahoma.
[01:47:51.215 --> 01:47:51.996]  Creed, thanks for holding.
[01:47:51.996 --> 01:47:52.256]  Go ahead.
[01:47:52.256 --> 01:47:54.316]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:47:54.316 --> 01:47:58.718]  My uncle works in a nursing home here in Oklahoma City, and they have 50 residents.
[01:47:58.718 --> 01:48:01.919]  48 took the vaccine, and 7 were dead within a week.
[01:48:02.708 --> 01:48:08.838]  You know, after seeing this, the nursing home company said, well, we'll give anyone that works here a hundred bucks to take the vaccine.
[01:48:08.838 --> 01:48:14.026]  Of course, only one person in the whole unit decided to take the vaccine after seeing what happened to the old people.
[01:48:14.802 --> 01:48:24.044]  And, um, you know, uh, that really woke my uncle up seeing that firsthand, um, you know, one, one-seventh of his residents dropping dead after taking the vaccine a week later.
[01:48:24.044 --> 01:48:28.645]  And notice Stalin said, one man dies, it's a tragedy, 10,000 dies, it's a statistic.
[01:48:28.645 --> 01:48:30.225]  The globalists have all war-gamed this.
[01:48:30.225 --> 01:48:36.067]  They, they, they use Yale, Harvard psychology departments to war-game all this before they did it.
[01:48:36.067 --> 01:48:37.547]  Can you, can you believe this?
[01:48:38.619 --> 01:48:39.360]  Oh, I can't believe it.
[01:48:39.360 --> 01:48:42.783]  Imagine taking this vaccine for a hundred bucks or a donut.
[01:48:42.783 --> 01:48:43.443]  Unbelievable.
[01:48:43.443 --> 01:48:45.585]  I have a separate story about my father-in-law.
[01:48:45.585 --> 01:48:46.726]  A healthy guy in his 50s.
[01:48:46.726 --> 01:48:51.370]  I warned him at Christmas with a Wolfgang Woodard report and Eaton report.
[01:48:51.370 --> 01:48:52.291]  I warned him at Christmas.
[01:48:52.291 --> 01:48:53.812]  I said, man, do not take this vaccine.
[01:48:53.812 --> 01:48:54.333]  You're healthy.
[01:48:54.333 --> 01:48:55.514]  You're in your 50s.
[01:48:55.514 --> 01:48:57.456]  He takes no medication, no problems.
[01:48:57.456 --> 01:48:59.617]  Took the vaccine, Pfizer, second dose.
[01:48:59.617 --> 01:49:02.260]  He was hospitalized because his blood pressure went to stroke level.
[01:49:02.973 --> 01:49:05.214]  And he nearly died of a stroke, a heart attack.
[01:49:05.214 --> 01:49:11.575]  They got him to the hospital, got his blood pressure down, and now he's on blood pressure medication indefinitely.
[01:49:11.575 --> 01:49:13.736]  So, I mean, his life has changed drastically.
[01:49:13.736 --> 01:49:14.156]  That's right.
[01:49:14.156 --> 01:49:16.937]  Make us all sick and take over our bodies.
[01:49:16.937 --> 01:49:20.818]  Sterilize us and make us take a bunch of drugs and try to get fatality back.
[01:49:20.818 --> 01:49:23.178]  But Pfizer says they've got boosters coming.
[01:49:23.178 --> 01:49:24.919]  You think your father-in-law is going to take his booster?
[01:49:25.979 --> 01:49:26.899]  Oh, I'm sure he will.
[01:49:26.899 --> 01:49:32.601]  And one thing I haven't heard mentioned on this show or anywhere else, rather, these vaccines are in clinical trials.
[01:49:32.601 --> 01:49:38.042]  And when you run clinical trials, don't you give the drug along with the placebo?
[01:49:38.042 --> 01:49:41.563]  So, I mean, do you think placebos are in the test groups?
[01:49:41.563 --> 01:49:43.324]  I mean, do you think... They're not even doing testing.
[01:49:43.324 --> 01:49:45.684]  They're calling it general testing in the general public.
[01:49:45.684 --> 01:49:48.285]  That's why the vaccine inserts are clear.
[01:49:48.285 --> 01:49:49.065]  Thank you, Creed.
[01:49:49.065 --> 01:49:49.685]  God bless you.
[01:49:49.685 --> 01:49:50.986]  Say hi to your family.
[01:49:50.986 --> 01:49:53.727]  And by the way, I'm coming back Sunday night.
[01:49:53.727 --> 01:49:55.207]  The entire transmission
[01:49:56.222 --> 01:49:57.483]  4 to 8 p.m.
[01:49:57.483 --> 01:50:01.684]  I'm gonna do four hours that night, and we're cutting most the ads in the last few hours.
[01:50:01.684 --> 01:50:03.485]  We're gonna take your phone calls.
[01:50:03.485 --> 01:50:07.947]  And if you love the vaccine, write down the toll-free number, folks, and call us.
[01:50:07.947 --> 01:50:09.468]  877-789-2539.
[01:50:09.468 --> 01:50:11.128]  Haven't been hearing those, though.
[01:50:11.128 --> 01:50:12.769]  It's so wonderful, though.
[01:50:12.769 --> 01:50:15.210]  Let's go ahead now and take another call.
[01:50:15.210 --> 01:50:17.451]  Let's talk to Sarah in Illinois.
[01:50:17.451 --> 01:50:17.971]  Thanks for holding.
[01:50:20.154 --> 01:50:21.315]  Hi, Alex.
[01:50:21.315 --> 01:50:22.195]  My name is Sarah.
[01:50:22.195 --> 01:50:24.377]  I am actually a school counselor in Illinois.
[01:50:24.377 --> 01:50:27.339]  I work with K-2 students.
[01:50:27.339 --> 01:50:34.484]  And one of the teachers I actually work with had to go home on Tuesday because I heard that her mom fell down the stairs.
[01:50:34.484 --> 01:50:41.029]  And I found out today that her mom fell down the stairs because she had a stroke and a heart attack.
[01:50:41.029 --> 01:50:43.471]  And now she has a traumatic brain injury.
[01:50:43.471 --> 01:50:48.014]  But this happened like two days after she took her second COVID vaccination.
[01:50:49.033 --> 01:50:51.035]  Wow, and how old was she?
[01:50:51.035 --> 01:50:52.897]  You know, I'm not sure how old her mom was.
[01:50:52.897 --> 01:50:55.540]  I'm guessing probably in her 60s, maybe early 70s.
[01:50:55.540 --> 01:50:59.044]  She's a little bit younger than I am, the teacher.
[01:50:59.044 --> 01:51:10.656]  I wonder how many people got to die until folks wake up because that's what we, you're the caller earlier about that he's got family works in a nursing home and they don't believe in vaccines now because they saw, you know, something like
[01:51:11.312 --> 01:51:13.893]  I mean, a large percentage of the residents die in one week.
[01:51:13.893 --> 01:51:22.537]  I mean, I have a crew member here whose mother is a head nurse and they have over 200 people at the nursing home and a whole bunch of them died within a week.
[01:51:22.537 --> 01:51:26.279]  I mean, they watch and the rest of them wouldn't even get up and eat for like a week.
[01:51:26.279 --> 01:51:28.320]  I mean, this is devastating.
[01:51:28.320 --> 01:51:33.722]  Like a king cobra went through the facility biting people.
[01:51:33.722 --> 01:51:40.585]  My greatest fear is that they start giving this to children and parents just willfully take their kids begin injecting with this poison and I watch like
[01:51:41.391 --> 01:51:44.553]  Hundreds of the children that I work with die.
[01:51:44.553 --> 01:51:47.396]  Well, kids are a lot tougher and they don't have as many plaques.
[01:51:47.396 --> 01:51:51.619]  See, the plaque in arteries is very similar, they say, to this protein.
[01:51:51.619 --> 01:51:54.000]  And as you get older, proteins form in the brain.
[01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:57.563]  But it's still going to hurt them really bad.
[01:51:57.563 --> 01:52:00.345]  What children are having, we're hearing, is convulsions.
[01:52:00.345 --> 01:52:05.269]  And that's an autoimmune response because the body is trying to fight it off.
[01:52:07.185 --> 01:52:09.807]  Well, that is, yeah, my heart is aching for the world.
[01:52:09.807 --> 01:52:10.388]  It really is.
[01:52:10.388 --> 01:52:14.812]  Like, all we can do is seriously pray, and like you say, like, turn to Jesus.
[01:52:14.812 --> 01:52:24.501]  I mean, this is our time to strengthen our mind, bodies, and spirits, and the fact that you talk about Jesus all the time, it makes me listen to you every day, because I know that you are, you are walking in the truth, and you are leading the way.
[01:52:24.501 --> 01:52:25.522]  So, I thank you very much.
[01:52:25.522 --> 01:52:27.464]  Well, God bless you, ma'am, and I want to say something.
[01:52:27.464 --> 01:52:31.688]  I'm as wicked as the day is long growing up, and I've been, I like to fight, and I like women the whole nine yards.
[01:52:32.388 --> 01:52:35.289]  I talk about Jesus all the time because I've always loved God, but I mean, it's here.
[01:52:35.289 --> 01:52:36.549]  World government, Satan.
[01:52:36.549 --> 01:52:39.790]  The only reason I can be on air is the Holy Spirit.
[01:52:39.790 --> 01:52:41.350]  I am animated by it.
[01:52:41.350 --> 01:52:42.551]  It is taking control of me.
[01:52:42.551 --> 01:52:51.113]  I've prayed to God the last six months to heal me of my issues of drinking and of getting angry, and it has.
[01:52:51.113 --> 01:52:54.253]  I've been healed of it recently, and it's all God.
[01:52:54.253 --> 01:52:56.254]  I've just turned myself over to Christ.
[01:52:56.254 --> 01:52:59.115]  I've said, just please, Holy Spirit, I'm too weak.
[01:52:59.115 --> 01:53:00.095]  I need you to come into me.
[01:53:01.741 --> 01:53:05.291]  Satan will come into you without you wanting Satan.
[01:53:05.291 --> 01:53:07.577]  The spirit of the world forces itself.
[01:53:07.577 --> 01:53:08.139]  You gotta...
[01:53:09.688 --> 01:53:10.328]  Knock on the door.
[01:53:10.328 --> 01:53:14.730]  And Christ is knocking on your door, but you've got to open your heart up.
[01:53:14.730 --> 01:53:17.912]  And you're not going to find it in these weird churches and all these things.
[01:53:17.912 --> 01:53:19.112]  These aren't churches anymore, folks.
[01:53:19.112 --> 01:53:20.313]  I'd like to have a headline.
[01:53:20.313 --> 01:53:23.674]  Pastors fight heartbeat bill in Texas.
[01:53:23.674 --> 01:53:25.655]  Pastors say it's not a baby.
[01:53:25.655 --> 01:53:26.876]  Those aren't pastors.
[01:53:26.876 --> 01:53:30.837]  Those are Satanists that went and got a seminary and got into the churches.
[01:53:30.837 --> 01:53:32.538]  They've captured everything.
[01:53:32.538 --> 01:53:37.240]  They're shutting down a church every week.
[01:53:37.240 --> 01:53:37.980]  He brought me the article.
[01:53:40.310 --> 01:53:44.091]  We're setting a church tolling system like every week in France.
[01:53:44.091 --> 01:53:46.872]  The Muslims are burning them down every week.
[01:53:46.872 --> 01:53:47.652]  This is the takeover.
[01:53:47.652 --> 01:53:50.473]  Okay, I got to seven calls.
[01:53:50.473 --> 01:53:53.014]  That's not the nine I wanted, but I'm going to go on a break.
[01:53:53.014 --> 01:53:57.216]  I'm going to come right back with callers that are patiently holding.
[01:53:57.216 --> 01:53:58.996]  So stay there.
[01:53:58.996 --> 01:54:02.838]  We will come right back to Ed and others.
[01:54:02.838 --> 01:54:06.879]  Please do not forget your prayers for this broadcast are key.
[01:54:06.879 --> 01:54:08.439]  Your financial support is wonderful.
[01:54:08.439 --> 01:54:09.580]  Products at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:54:11.841 --> 01:54:15.423]  Just as important as spreading the word and just thank you folks for all you do.
[01:54:15.423 --> 01:54:17.684]  We have the most banned section of Banned.Video.
[01:54:17.684 --> 01:54:20.586]  It's all the medical doctors and scientists that have been censored.
[01:54:20.586 --> 01:54:23.087]  And they're the scientists and they're laying out the facts.
[01:54:23.087 --> 01:54:30.351]  And we've got interviews a year ago with medical doctors warning about the heart attacks and the blood clots because they know why they never can make something for the cold.
[01:54:30.351 --> 01:54:31.511]  That's what Corona is.
[01:54:31.511 --> 01:54:32.912]  It's like a super cold.
[01:54:32.912 --> 01:54:35.253]  It's very souped up.
[01:54:35.253 --> 01:54:36.754]  Because it attacks your own body.
[01:54:36.754 --> 01:54:37.815]  I mean, it's incredible.
[01:54:37.815 --> 01:54:38.735]  And now it's happening.
[01:54:38.735 --> 01:54:40.056]  And they knew what they were doing.
[01:54:40.056 --> 01:54:40.636]  This is incredible.
[01:54:43.995 --> 01:54:50.163]  Serving with InfoWars is a great honor, but I still need my morning coffee.
[01:54:50.163 --> 01:54:58.633]  And luckily, our break room at the InfoWars headquarters is stocked full of high-quality InfoWars store Patriot Blend coffee.
[01:54:59.557 --> 01:55:11.199]  Grown in the high mountains of southern Mexico, the Chiapas farmers grow 100% organic, non-GMO coffee at the ideal altitude for the perfect cup.
[01:55:11.199 --> 01:55:16.320]  A robust coffee with great flavor and mild acidity.
[01:55:16.320 --> 01:55:20.361]  There has never been a more important time to support InfoWars.
[01:55:20.361 --> 01:55:25.342]  So if you love coffee, and if you want to fight for freedom, then you can help.
[01:55:27.234 --> 01:55:30.158]  Order now at the InfoWars store.
[01:55:30.158 --> 01:55:39.951]  Sign up for auto-ship and get your own high-quality supply of Patriot Blend coffee delivered right to your door at InfoWarsStore.com
[01:55:44.361 --> 01:55:48.225]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[01:55:48.225 --> 01:55:52.549]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[01:55:52.549 --> 01:56:00.676]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them a bottle of Ultimate Fish Oil from Infowarsstore.com.
[01:56:01.357 --> 01:56:18.026]  Recent studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[01:56:18.026 --> 01:56:29.052]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[01:56:29.552 --> 01:56:38.039]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality.
[01:56:38.039 --> 01:56:47.347]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:56:47.347 --> 01:56:49.990]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:57:28.371 --> 01:57:39.333]  Imagine, before a year ago, if you were taking your child to preschool daycare, and they said, oh sorry, you can't come in the building.
[01:57:39.333 --> 01:57:41.294]  You'd say, this place must be criminal.
[01:57:41.294 --> 01:57:45.915]  They must be dirty, they must be hurting the kids, they must be beating them or worse.
[01:57:45.915 --> 01:57:50.496]  You'd never, but oh now all the schools everywhere in the world, oh sorry, parents, no one can ever come in, that spreads viruses.
[01:57:50.496 --> 01:57:54.456]  Oh, you can't see your parents or family in a hospital or nursing home, sorry.
[01:57:54.456 --> 01:57:56.777]  All written up by the UN, all written up by the globalists.
[01:57:57.501 --> 01:58:01.083]  As an excuse for institutions to kill our old people.
[01:58:01.083 --> 01:58:06.926]  And, oh, CVS and Walgreens and Walmart won't ever show anybody the vaccines.
[01:58:06.926 --> 01:58:12.068]  And it's a controlled rollout, so no one else is allowed to buy a vial of it and have it tested.
[01:58:12.068 --> 01:58:15.070]  After all, it's secret and Bill Gates will sue you.
[01:58:15.070 --> 01:58:20.433]  And if you try to get it and test it, that's patented secret and no one can know.
[01:58:20.433 --> 01:58:22.454]  Oh, and the insert says no testing.
[01:58:22.454 --> 01:58:23.034]  It's all blank.
[01:58:26.138 --> 01:58:27.919]  It's the perfect way to carry this out.
[01:58:27.919 --> 01:58:31.182]  It's what you do if you were going to kill people.
[01:58:31.182 --> 01:58:40.989]  And you hit them with something that affects everybody different, where your body produces a protein, recognizes it as an enemy, and then starts attacking itself.
[01:58:40.989 --> 01:58:46.973]  And it's all hiding in plain view with the censorship to silence the good doctors and people that expose it.
[01:58:48.559 --> 01:59:02.629]  And with the tyranny, and with the fear, and with the lying about the dead numbers to scare you, the censorship, the fear, the lies, and then the cover-up of the death and the disease, and they make all the money off those that survive, but linger.
[01:59:02.629 --> 01:59:05.591]  How evil, how sick, how diabolical.
[01:59:05.591 --> 01:59:08.513]  Charlene, and then James, and Ed.
[01:59:08.513 --> 01:59:09.794]  Charlene, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:59:09.794 --> 01:59:12.516]  I have three points.
[01:59:12.516 --> 01:59:16.859]  My brother went and got the vaccine, and his arm hurted for a week.
[01:59:19.301 --> 01:59:23.219]  And the second point is, why can't these people who have lost loved ones
[01:59:23.666 --> 01:59:27.969]  Start to sue the doctors, the media, and the nurses who are injecting them.
[01:59:54.173 --> 01:59:56.636]  And so, you've assaulted me, I have a right to defend myself.
[01:59:56.636 --> 01:59:58.858]  That's where this is all going.
[01:59:58.858 --> 02:00:00.040]  And by the way, you're a nurse.
[02:00:00.040 --> 02:00:01.982]  What's your view on this?
[02:00:01.982 --> 02:00:02.603]  Me?
[02:00:02.603 --> 02:00:04.264]  Yes.
[02:00:04.264 --> 02:00:14.396]  Well, they all need to be sued on it, because Canada is going through with the Nuremberg trial on their doctors, and they're suing Trudeau and Pope Francis and the Queen.
[02:00:14.989 --> 02:00:15.869]  No, you're absolutely right.
[02:00:15.869 --> 02:00:19.231]  A lot of people are suing over the Nuremberg Code.
[02:00:19.231 --> 02:00:20.051]  You are damn right.
[02:00:20.051 --> 02:00:21.232]  Thank you, Charlene.
[02:00:21.232 --> 02:00:23.473]  All right, let's talk to Ed in Ohio.
[02:00:23.473 --> 02:00:26.114]  Go ahead, Ed.
[02:00:26.114 --> 02:00:28.255]  Hey, Alex.
[02:00:28.255 --> 02:00:30.256]  Before anything else, I'd like to pray with you.
[02:00:30.256 --> 02:00:30.576]  Is that okay?
[02:00:30.576 --> 02:00:32.017]  We got about a minute and a half.
[02:00:32.017 --> 02:00:33.797]  Go ahead, brother.
[02:00:33.797 --> 02:00:35.538]  Copy that.
[02:00:35.538 --> 02:00:43.782]  Father in heaven, please let the flames of truth coming from this man's mouth burn away the evil that is it.
[02:00:44.719 --> 02:00:49.461]  Shrouding the minds of our fellow citizens and other people of the world.
[02:00:49.461 --> 02:00:51.362]  We ask this in the name of Jesus Christ.
[02:00:51.362 --> 02:00:51.702]  Amen.
[02:00:51.702 --> 02:00:53.143]  Amen.
[02:00:53.143 --> 02:00:56.144]  All right, Alex.
[02:00:56.144 --> 02:01:11.331]  My grandmother just took the shot against my advisement, and now her bilirubin count has gone completely off the charts, and her and my grandfather both no longer have any energy.
[02:01:11.331 --> 02:01:14.132]  And these are two older folks who have
[02:01:16.137 --> 02:01:27.561]  You know, stay there.
[02:01:27.561 --> 02:01:32.042]  I've got Robert Barnes coming on, but I want you to be able to tell him the story of this.
[02:01:32.042 --> 02:01:34.683]  And that's what they said that immediately started happening.
[02:01:34.683 --> 02:01:35.783]  People are totally exhausted.
[02:01:35.783 --> 02:01:38.024]  That's what people that work at nursing homes I know say.
[02:01:38.024 --> 02:01:38.924]  And a bunch of them die.
[02:01:39.671 --> 02:01:45.056]  And so this is just a massive crime against humanity, but people love to be virtue signaling.
[02:01:45.056 --> 02:01:47.218]  So they're marching into these death camps willfully.
[02:01:52.404 --> 02:02:01.091]  Listeners have rightfully been complaining the last six months or so, saying, where are most of the best-selling products you have that we love?
[02:02:01.091 --> 02:02:03.333]  And my answer is, the supply chain has broken down.
[02:02:03.333 --> 02:02:07.616]  I have to either reformulate or I have to lower the quality to get a lot of these.
[02:02:07.616 --> 02:02:09.998]  And so that's why we don't have a lot of products in.
[02:02:09.998 --> 02:02:14.261]  That's why InfoWars is in financial trouble, is because if we had the product, you would be buying it.
[02:02:14.261 --> 02:02:14.962]  We'd have the money.
[02:02:15.342 --> 02:02:22.844]  But so many of them have been sold out, just like you notice a lot of other items at the store aren't available because civilization is being artificially imploded.
[02:02:22.844 --> 02:02:26.105]  But, finally, X2 is back in stock.
[02:02:26.105 --> 02:02:27.226]  The good halogen.
[02:02:27.226 --> 02:02:28.746]  Deep Earth Crystal Iodine.
[02:02:28.746 --> 02:02:30.027]  So essential in your body.
[02:02:30.027 --> 02:02:30.847]  It's really the missing link.
[02:02:31.447 --> 02:02:32.288]  It's 50% off.
[02:02:32.288 --> 02:02:35.450]  We've got a big shipment of it at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:02:35.450 --> 02:02:38.693]  Now, when it gets ready to sell out, we'll have to go back to near full price.
[02:02:38.693 --> 02:02:39.914]  Take advantage of this now.
[02:02:39.914 --> 02:02:40.474]  Stock up.
[02:02:40.474 --> 02:02:41.875]  And don't forget to take your X2.
[02:02:41.875 --> 02:02:45.578]  Because I have a tendency to forget how great it is and not take it myself.
[02:02:45.578 --> 02:02:49.261]  But when I do, stamina, libido, energy, weight loss, it's incredible.
[02:02:49.261 --> 02:02:50.141]  It's essential.
[02:02:50.141 --> 02:02:54.945]  It's X2 at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:02:54.945 --> 02:02:57.067]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:02:57.067 --> 02:02:59.809]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[02:03:01.647 --> 02:03:14.074]  Well, I saw he wrote a big piece that got picked up by a lot of newspapers and publications about the dangers of the COVID-19 vaccines and how they're really crossing the Rubicon and how the answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:03:14.074 --> 02:03:21.318]  Good friend of mine, great historian, not just a famous lawyer, is Robert Barnes, and he joins us the rest of the hour.
[02:03:21.318 --> 02:03:22.338]  I'm hosting the fourth hour.
[02:03:22.338 --> 02:03:23.639]  I'll continue with your calls.
[02:03:23.639 --> 02:03:26.861]  We're going to get to some of the calls with Barnes as well this hour.
[02:03:26.861 --> 02:03:30.983]  Jenny and Brian and James and Ed and Brian and Jeff.
[02:03:32.617 --> 02:03:35.098]  Your calls are all coming up.
[02:03:35.098 --> 02:03:37.499]  We don't screen the calls, just have a good phone line.
[02:03:37.499 --> 02:03:40.359]  Nobody calls in saying, I love the vaccine or anything bad happened.
[02:03:40.359 --> 02:03:46.721]  They call in saying, the whole nursing home, you know, 10% of them died in the nursing home and nobody else will get out of their bed.
[02:03:46.721 --> 02:03:49.442]  You know, my grandma died, my grandpa died.
[02:03:49.442 --> 02:03:52.243]  I'm a nurse, people come in paralyzed from the vaccine.
[02:03:52.243 --> 02:03:54.604]  I mean, this is not a vaccine.
[02:03:54.604 --> 02:03:58.045]  And already with the adverse reaction reporting system is off the charts.
[02:03:58.746 --> 02:04:05.631]  And so Robert Barnes has been talking a lot about this since a year ago, that these mRNAs are not vaccines.
[02:04:05.631 --> 02:04:08.273]  Hell, the virus vector system is not a classical vaccine.
[02:04:08.273 --> 02:04:13.416]  They don't give you an attenuated virus, and you learn how to beat it, to less side effects, but it does work.
[02:04:13.416 --> 02:04:21.142]  They fire a live virus inside a virus into your cells and reprogram them, or they program the ribosomes to go in and reprogram your body.
[02:04:21.142 --> 02:04:23.563]  And, Barnes, this is smoking gun.
[02:04:23.563 --> 02:04:27.126]  Immunization with SARS coronavirus vaccine leads to pulmonary
[02:04:29.677 --> 02:04:39.482]  Autoimmune responses or immunopathology of the rats and mice challenged with the SARS virus, the coronavirus, SARS virus.
[02:04:39.482 --> 02:04:50.508]  They did a bunch of different coronaviruses, same family, and they did three different vaccines and it basically caused holes to be eaten in the lungs, blood clots and death in a large portion of them.
[02:04:50.508 --> 02:04:57.212]  There's a bunch of other studies showing the same thing, but this is a prestigious level four lab that studies bioweapons, you name it.
[02:04:58.590 --> 02:05:16.217]  This is huge from nine years ago, and now the death numbers are just exploding, and now I showed video earlier where a pharmacist opens up the J&J virus vector, FrankenShot, and it's all clean, except for QR code, the lot number.
[02:05:17.168 --> 02:05:29.956]  Not what's in it, not who made it, not the side effects because no studies were done, but then John Oliver and all the other programmers says, oh it's all tested, it's all safe, don't listen to Tucker Carlson, don't listen to Joe Rogan, don't listen to Alex Jones.
[02:05:29.956 --> 02:05:41.184]  Well I know you've been studying this deeply, I know you're preparing legal actions on this that you may be able to break today, but my God, how do we respond to this giant revolution, this assault
[02:05:41.907 --> 02:05:44.970]  Uh, where no one will be able to know what happened because no test was done.
[02:05:44.970 --> 02:05:46.411]  They lie and say studies were done.
[02:05:46.411 --> 02:05:56.500]  Now they're going after the children, Robert Barnes, with their emergency injunctions, like Dr. Wolfgang Wudarg tried, along with the former chief scientist at Pfizer, uh, Dr. Yadon last year.
[02:05:56.500 --> 02:05:57.381]  What do we do?
[02:05:57.381 --> 02:06:00.744]  Because everything they warned of in their emergency injunction has now come true.
[02:06:02.242 --> 02:06:02.622]  Yes.
[02:06:02.622 --> 02:06:08.165]  I mean, there's several medical problems with the vaccines in a wide range of contexts.
[02:06:08.165 --> 02:06:17.770]  And we've been talking about them for over a year and said that a lot of the hype about the pandemic seemed to be driven to get people to be desperate for vaccines as the solution.
[02:06:17.770 --> 02:06:21.572]  Goes back to Event 201 and the Gates Foundation and what China was really up to.
[02:06:22.293 --> 02:06:34.517]  But on top of all that, from a purely legal perspective, and of course you have the swine flu debacle vaccine of 1976, where even CBS admitted it was a disaster back when you could still sue over vaccines more easily.
[02:06:34.517 --> 02:06:42.399]  The CDC has a giant site with all, okay, we gave people cancer viruses with this, we sterilized people with that, I mean, it's a fact.
[02:06:43.743 --> 02:06:47.085]  Yes, and there is no history of successful coronavirus vaccines.
[02:06:47.085 --> 02:06:53.348]  So, I mean, there's just a long problem after problem after problem, red flag after red flag after red flag.
[02:06:53.348 --> 02:06:56.770]  And from a legal perspective, what's kind of unique here is twofold.
[02:06:56.770 --> 02:07:06.455]  One is this is the first attempt to start mandating a drug against informed consent since the Nuremberg Code went into effect in 1947.
[02:07:06.455 --> 02:07:12.618]  All of the other illicit governmental experimentation on people has mostly been done in secret or by subterfuge.
[02:07:13.118 --> 02:07:30.166]  Here we're having overt attempts to force people to take something and put it in their body without them being first informed of what the risk is in a meaningful way and second without them consenting to it by coercing it as a condition of travel, coercing it as a condition of employment, coercing it as a condition of education.
[02:07:30.166 --> 02:07:41.211]  And the core problem with that, aside from the constitutional problem and the problem from the Nuremberg Code, and people may not know, the Nuremberg Code not only put in the informed consent principle as a matter of medical ethics,
[02:07:41.651 --> 02:07:48.600]  The United States courts have recognized that the Nuremberg Code is enforceable against governments and other actors.
[02:07:49.315 --> 02:08:04.883]  Now, on top of that, the emergency use authorization, and the media has kind of suppressed information about this, these particular vaccines have not met the requisite medical level of approval to be considered regular pharmaceutical drugs.
[02:08:04.883 --> 02:08:11.746]  Instead, they were only given emergency use authorization, EUA authorization, under a specific statute.
[02:08:12.310 --> 02:08:18.593]  That specific statute states that you cannot mandate it and no one else can mandate it.
[02:08:18.593 --> 02:08:31.900]  And the reason for it is the concerns that the risk may be too high because how can you have informed consent about a drug that has not even met the requisite level of medical testing to be regularly approved?
[02:08:31.900 --> 02:08:34.041]  You can't because they don't know what all the risks are.
[02:08:34.681 --> 02:08:37.283]  We're basically living guinea pigs.
[02:08:37.283 --> 02:08:40.565]  People taking these vaccines are living humans.
[02:08:40.565 --> 02:08:43.968]  Is that what Big Pharma and the UN and Gates are counting on is?
[02:08:43.968 --> 02:08:44.948]  They put this out there.
[02:08:44.948 --> 02:08:46.749]  They got governments to sign on.
[02:08:46.749 --> 02:08:50.212]  So now, in a way, we're all guilty for letting it happen.
[02:08:50.212 --> 02:08:55.095]  They think now, societally, we'll all defend ourselves because they got us to sign on to a fraud.
[02:08:55.095 --> 02:08:59.598]  And so we'll continue to basically sign on to the Nigerian email scam.
[02:08:59.598 --> 02:09:02.360]  Even after you've been ripped off once, you don't want to admit you've been ripped off.
[02:09:02.360 --> 02:09:03.981]  How do you counter psychology like that?
[02:09:05.242 --> 02:09:13.826]  Well, I think one way to counter it is just to look at the information that you were one of the very first people to report that now even mainstream media is finally coming around to.
[02:09:13.826 --> 02:09:20.090]  But for most of the last year, they called it conspiracy theory, which is COVID-19 is not a natural occurring virus.
[02:09:20.090 --> 02:09:28.654]  COVID-19 is a man-made disease, almost guaranteed to have come from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, partially funded by people like Bill Gates.
[02:09:28.974 --> 02:09:37.557]  Partially funded by people like Fauci, misappropriating governmental monies in part for it, for their BSL Level 4 research.
[02:09:37.557 --> 02:09:39.617]  And just look at that as an example.
[02:09:39.617 --> 02:09:50.861]  That was an example where they attempted and they were convinced that they could basically bamboozle the American public into believing this was just a bat-driven virus and somebody decided to have some bad bat soup.
[02:09:51.341 --> 02:09:57.665]  And that somehow magically led to an unusually infectious virus that spread as rapidly as this one did.
[02:09:57.665 --> 02:10:04.828]  And we have major virology institutes with CRISPR editors all over the world that discover of HIV saying it's a man-made.
[02:10:04.828 --> 02:10:08.210]  They took a cold virus, put an HIV delivery system on it.
[02:10:08.210 --> 02:10:12.372]  It's not HIV, but it has the same spreadability through the mucous membrane.
[02:10:12.372 --> 02:10:13.153]  But here's the deal.
[02:10:13.153 --> 02:10:17.135]  Even if they have a vaccine liability protection, this isn't a vaccine, but what about the fact
[02:10:17.873 --> 02:10:25.446]  They violate informed consent, violates Nuremberg Code, but also the fact Fauci and Gates can be sued for funding the Wuhan lab.
[02:10:25.446 --> 02:10:29.974]  There's a trillion ways to cut these guys up, and people need to start following the suits, don't they?
[02:10:30.982 --> 02:10:31.602]  Yes, no doubt.
[02:10:31.602 --> 02:10:37.405]  And in my view, it violates the Emergency Use Authorization Act, which says you cannot compel or coerce it.
[02:10:37.405 --> 02:10:43.869]  So anybody that's compelling or coercing it is violating the very terms and condition upon which this drug is even allowed to be distributed.
[02:10:43.869 --> 02:10:48.731]  The whole point is that this drug can only be distributed if there's complete informed consent.
[02:10:48.731 --> 02:10:52.593]  It cannot even be legally distributed if there's not informed consent.
[02:10:52.593 --> 02:10:53.814]  You cannot coerce it.
[02:10:53.814 --> 02:10:57.756]  So anybody coercing it is violating the law by which this drug was even distributed.
[02:10:57.756 --> 02:10:58.897]  Well again, you're right.
[02:10:58.897 --> 02:10:59.477]  You're a lawyer.
[02:10:59.477 --> 02:11:00.278]  It's on record.
[02:11:00.278 --> 02:11:03.540]  The inserts on these vaccines that aren't vaccines are blank.
[02:11:03.540 --> 02:11:05.261]  Which again, violates federal law.
[02:11:05.261 --> 02:11:08.703]  I mean, why was Gates and them crazy enough to do this?
[02:11:08.703 --> 02:11:15.627]  I think it's because he got busted with Epstein, and they panicked as a diversion, and they had this plan, Operation Lockstep, on the shelf.
[02:11:15.627 --> 02:11:17.088]  In fact, I know that's what happened.
[02:11:17.088 --> 02:11:20.090]  His wife's now confirmed she's pissed that he was having sex with kids, probably.
[02:11:21.559 --> 02:11:25.061]  Well, if you look at Bill Gates, Bill Gates has a long history of this being his agenda.
[02:11:25.061 --> 02:11:38.407]  I mean, really, it's his family agenda going back more than a half century, which is he believes that getting popular acceptance of vaccines for more populations on a broader scale, because this is unusual in having a vaccine for adults.
[02:11:38.767 --> 02:11:47.354]  And not only a vaccine for adults, apparently a vaccine you have to take two shots for, maybe three shots for, maybe a shot every six months for, maybe a shot you have to take the rest of your life.
[02:11:47.354 --> 02:11:48.956]  That doesn't end with this shot.
[02:11:48.956 --> 02:11:51.518]  That's been Bill Gates' express, explicit agenda.
[02:11:51.518 --> 02:11:56.682]  Because he believes that somehow mass vaccines are going to mass-reduce the population.
[02:11:56.682 --> 02:12:00.325]  He explains his explanation for this, but does anybody really buy that?
[02:12:00.325 --> 02:12:01.186]  I believe that he does.
[02:12:01.186 --> 02:12:03.828]  He says, we're going to get rid of people with this, so take it.
[02:12:03.828 --> 02:12:04.949]  He's really telling you.
[02:12:04.949 --> 02:12:06.651]  Like when Count Dracula comes by and says,
[02:12:07.211 --> 02:12:08.112]  Can I come to dinner?
[02:12:08.112 --> 02:12:08.652]  Let me in.
[02:12:08.652 --> 02:12:11.694]  You have to metaphysically... He has to tell you, I'm here for dinner.
[02:12:11.694 --> 02:12:14.156]  Except you're the dinner.
[02:12:14.156 --> 02:12:14.897]  That's exactly right.
[02:12:14.897 --> 02:12:17.379]  And Bill Gates has been pretty overt about a lot of this stuff.
[02:12:17.379 --> 02:12:23.923]  I mean, not only that, look at how well this man-made virus managed to magically mirror a Bill Gates dream pandemic.
[02:12:23.923 --> 02:12:30.448]  It has, you know, de facto death panels, racially discriminatory in effect, politically helps his causes.
[02:12:30.448 --> 02:12:32.810]  Mighty interesting how this all tended to work together for Bill Gates.
[02:12:32.810 --> 02:12:35.472]  And it came right out on time to embarrass Donald Trump and the rest of it.
[02:12:37.990 --> 02:12:40.572]  Couldn't have scripted it better.
[02:12:40.572 --> 02:12:42.833]  Robert Barnes, great historian, great lawyer.
[02:12:42.833 --> 02:12:45.696]  We'll be right back with him with more, and then your phone calls.
[02:12:45.696 --> 02:12:52.621]  We're also going to get into the Chauvin trial, the federal indictments.
[02:12:52.621 --> 02:13:00.507]  170 years ago, the British royal family financed scientists to develop a plan for scientific dictatorship worldwide.
[02:13:00.507 --> 02:13:05.550]  That grew into the robber barons, and then into the eugenics movement, Hitler, and of course, the rest is history.
[02:13:06.411 --> 02:13:07.011]  We're good to go.
[02:13:35.561 --> 02:13:38.183]  You can burn copies of it anywhere in the world.
[02:13:38.183 --> 02:13:39.544]  I'm asking you to.
[02:13:39.544 --> 02:13:40.665]  I'm begging you to.
[02:13:40.665 --> 02:13:46.029]  This film predicted the Great Reset, the New Orleaner Takeover, the fake virus, and so much more.
[02:13:46.029 --> 02:13:48.771]  That's why the film is evergreen and more explosive than ever.
[02:13:48.771 --> 02:13:51.674]  Get it today at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:13:51.674 --> 02:13:52.374]  The best product.
[02:13:52.374 --> 02:13:56.958]  I'm not supposed to be biased, but I'm going to tell you all now, if you haven't tried TurboForce, you need to try it.
[02:13:56.958 --> 02:13:58.299]  I've tried TurboForce with everything.
[02:13:59.674 --> 02:14:01.375]  Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy.
[02:14:01.375 --> 02:14:03.035]  I put TurboForce in my coffee.
[02:14:03.035 --> 02:14:03.975]  That was a crazy week.
[02:14:03.975 --> 02:14:15.659]  I don't remember sleeping, but... As far as the products go, TurboForce is my favorite, and all the Infowars products are down to taking control of your life, taking control of your health, and not relying on other people to do it for you.
[02:14:15.659 --> 02:14:16.979]  Nobody wakes up in the morning...
[02:14:18.456 --> 02:14:20.858]  And thinks, I'm gonna give that person over there a better life.
[02:14:20.858 --> 02:14:22.239]  I'm gonna wake up today, you know what?
[02:14:22.239 --> 02:14:26.503]  I'm gonna spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier, happier, and richer.
[02:14:26.503 --> 02:14:28.725]  I'm gonna make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend.
[02:14:28.725 --> 02:14:30.246]  I don't think that happens very often.
[02:14:30.246 --> 02:14:31.047]  It's never happened to me.
[02:14:31.047 --> 02:14:33.969]  I've never had anyone knock on my door and said, Tate, you're such a good guy.
[02:14:33.969 --> 02:14:35.690]  How can I improve your life in every single way?
[02:14:35.690 --> 02:14:38.573]  There's only one person who woke up and thought that, and that was me.
[02:14:38.573 --> 02:14:39.814]  I woke up and thought, you know what?
[02:14:39.814 --> 02:14:40.094]  Okay.
[02:14:40.294 --> 02:14:41.514]  I wanna take control of my life.
[02:14:41.514 --> 02:14:42.635]  I wanna take control of my health.
[02:14:42.635 --> 02:14:46.536]  And that's why you need to go to Infowars.com and take control of your health right now and support the resistance.
[02:14:46.536 --> 02:14:47.696]  Don't buy into the groupthink.
[02:14:47.696 --> 02:14:48.697]  Don't drink the Kool-Aid.
[02:14:48.697 --> 02:14:49.837]  Drink the TurboForce.
[02:14:49.837 --> 02:14:53.999]  Kool-Aid's bad and the TurboForce is good.
[02:14:53.999 --> 02:15:03.002]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:15:03.002 --> 02:15:06.743]  I've been through the desert on a horse with no name.
[02:15:21.657 --> 02:15:24.397]  You know, I was born into the family I was born into.
[02:15:24.397 --> 02:15:26.138]  I was born into the country I was born into.
[02:15:26.138 --> 02:15:29.019]  And I'm glad to be an American, a Texan.
[02:15:29.019 --> 02:15:35.141]  But I did grow up and had family that told me that the government was evil and bad and corrupt and had some really evil elements in it because they were there.
[02:15:35.141 --> 02:15:35.841]  They saw it happen.
[02:15:37.972 --> 02:15:41.853]  And then the internet goes, oh look, Jones admits he's involved with the CIA or something.
[02:15:41.853 --> 02:15:47.495]  No, no, no, that's my family saying the government was corrupt because they were involved in corrupt areas of it.
[02:15:47.495 --> 02:15:49.355]  That doesn't mean I'm part of it.
[02:15:49.355 --> 02:15:50.556]  You judge a tree by its fruits.
[02:15:50.556 --> 02:15:54.517]  We're here exposing this because it's in the historical record.
[02:15:54.517 --> 02:15:56.498]  That's where you really learn what's happening.
[02:15:56.498 --> 02:15:57.698]  This stuff's really not hidden.
[02:15:58.351 --> 02:16:04.793]  Bill Gates and others, as Robert Barnes, constitutional lawyer, just mentioned, bragged about this as a blueprint for power and a takeover.
[02:16:04.793 --> 02:16:07.254]  How they'd use a virus to bring in world government.
[02:16:07.254 --> 02:16:18.278]  How they'd censor their opposition and create a panic and have unlimited shots and take control of human evolution.
[02:16:18.278 --> 02:16:19.018]  And now it's here.
[02:16:21.525 --> 02:16:26.652]  Robert Barnes is about to give you exclusive breaking information.
[02:16:26.652 --> 02:16:31.199]  Here is the exclusive breaking information as humanity fights back.
[02:16:31.199 --> 02:16:31.680]  Robert Barnes.
[02:16:33.078 --> 02:16:38.401]  Yes, we're going to be filing suit over the next two weeks across the country against three groups.
[02:16:38.401 --> 02:16:49.247]  Governments, employers, and educational institutions that are attempting to force or coerce people to have the vaccine because it violates basic core rights under the statute.
[02:16:49.247 --> 02:16:54.490]  The Emergency Use Authorization Law does not authorize this to be coerced on anybody.
[02:16:54.490 --> 02:16:58.492]  It requires as a precondition of its availability
[02:16:59.012 --> 02:17:10.147]  The informed consent principles also reflected in, secondly, the Nuremberg Code, put in place in 1947, so we would not treat human beings as guinea pigs anymore.
[02:17:10.147 --> 02:17:16.376]  There'd be no more state experimentation or doctor experimentation on human beings without their informed consent.
[02:17:16.996 --> 02:17:19.818]  And third, it violates court constitutional rights.
[02:17:19.818 --> 02:17:30.324]  That the old Jacobson decision was a limited decision with a limited context that the Supreme Court increasingly recognizes has no valid legitimacy today.
[02:17:30.324 --> 02:17:44.873]  I have long been waiting for a time to challenge the foundation of that decision because it led to the trill- it was the foundation of the Trilogy of Infamy that led to the Korematsu and Connie Buck decisions that allowed forced sterilizations and forced detention camps in America.
[02:17:45.373 --> 02:17:50.117]  They are decisions that should live in infamy and should be condemned and damned appropriately.
[02:17:50.117 --> 02:17:57.964]  And I wish to use these cases to challenge the Jacobson premise across the entire board and to bury that trilogy of infamy once and for all.
[02:17:57.964 --> 02:18:06.711]  So, working with Bobby Kennedy and others on all of the legal issues related to these cases and the constitutional issues, we will have the suits filed within the next two weeks.
[02:18:07.271 --> 02:18:11.136]  And we're actually talking to a range of potential plaintiffs.
[02:18:11.136 --> 02:18:14.980]  There are people who have already been fired because they refuse to take the vaccine.
[02:18:14.980 --> 02:18:19.345]  People at risk of right now being fired because they don't take the vaccine.
[02:18:19.345 --> 02:18:25.852]  Not only that, there's going to be a fourth component in some of these cases because it appears employers are violating certain HIPAA principles.
[02:18:26.252 --> 02:18:34.719]  By demanding people sacrifice their medical privacy or disclosing records concerning their medical privacy to third parties without authorization under the law.
[02:18:34.719 --> 02:18:45.668]  So the goal, because a lot of contract tracking and tracing basically involved an invasion of HIPAA protected rights that employers could not involuntarily, against the lack of informed consent, conduct and engage in.
[02:18:46.008 --> 02:19:03.698]  So the goal is to bring back the rights to medical privacy, bring back the informed consent movement that the Nuremberg Code established for the world to follow, and make it the law of the land in the United States, as frankly the statutes in our Constitution already say that it is, and existing case law already says that it is.
[02:19:03.698 --> 02:19:08.881]  We're going to be careful and selective where we bring the suit, how we bring the suit, to give us the best chance of success.
[02:19:09.321 --> 02:19:21.910]  Knowing we may run into obstacles or hurdles early, but ultimately I believe we will be able to establish that people have a right of medical privacy and cannot have something forced into their body against their informed consent in violation of the Nuremberg Code.
[02:19:21.910 --> 02:19:26.473]  Especially these vaccines, which are uniquely unproven to be safe and effective.
[02:19:27.156 --> 02:19:33.461]  Robert, let's talk about the motive of Bill Gates, the UN, the globalists, the Wuhan lab, the prescripting.
[02:19:33.461 --> 02:19:38.564]  Now, even the former head of the CDC, Redfield, says clearly it's a man made out of a lab.
[02:19:38.564 --> 02:19:43.808]  The discoverer of HIV, the Australian government, the Indian government has a $2 billion CRISPR machine.
[02:19:43.808 --> 02:19:44.369]  They scanned it.
[02:19:44.369 --> 02:19:44.649]  They said,
[02:19:45.009 --> 02:19:49.150]  I can see the pea shuttle genes, where they gene-gunned it and fired viruses together.
[02:19:49.150 --> 02:19:54.611]  This is done at a microscopic level, and they do it millions of times until they finally get one that's like they want.
[02:19:54.611 --> 02:20:04.614]  Then they breed that in pigs, then those pigs die, they then feed it to more piglets, and then take the blood out, and then use an electron microscope to funnel out all the viruses.
[02:20:04.614 --> 02:20:09.075]  So that's how this, there's a lot of ways to do it, I've read about it, but one way the Chinese were doing it at Wuhan,
[02:20:10.040 --> 02:20:10.860]  We're good to go.
[02:20:28.454 --> 02:20:42.684]  Those that die again, you do it, then you extract the blood, then you take out the viruses you want, now you've got a growth of viruses, and you keep growing them, and then you release it into the human population where it starts replicating, and then you have the answer to the disease you created.
[02:20:42.684 --> 02:20:56.473]  The idea that this just accidentally, at the time it came out, when Trump was defeating China, and the world was waking up, and nationalism and free market was exploding, and we were going back to who we were, like 1955 on steroids, but for everybody, they had to counter it,
[02:20:56.673 --> 02:21:02.088]  And this is the globalist counter-offensive, and they admit they had plans like this on the shelf before!
[02:21:02.088 --> 02:21:03.471]  So, my God, it's so obvious!
[02:21:04.628 --> 02:21:05.229]  Well, exactly.
[02:21:05.229 --> 02:21:10.252]  It's a lack of historical understanding by a large range of the public that you understand.
[02:21:10.252 --> 02:21:16.977]  I mean, if you read books like Guns, Germs and Steel or other things like it, you know, germs have changed the world more than anything.
[02:21:16.977 --> 02:21:26.304]  So the desire to weaponize those germs to be selectively effective against your opponent has been something that they've been obsessed with throughout the 1900s.
[02:21:26.304 --> 02:21:29.427]  And they just were kind of secretive about it, pretended it was bio-safety.
[02:21:29.887 --> 02:21:45.571]  You know, you've had Francis Boyle on who's been talking about this for more than three decades, the great risk this posed, and could it be a coincidence that one of the world's most dangerous biosafety labs experimenting in coronaviruses happens to be the location of the source for this virus?
[02:21:46.011 --> 02:22:03.045]  And then not only that, you go to the second capacity, and how is it that, you know, China created this pandemic effect, this lockdown policies, by showing how scary and dangerous and terrifying and frightening it was, and, you know, the, and so the whole, and saying the only way you could deal with it was the lockdowns, you know, the imperial policy model.
[02:22:03.045 --> 02:22:15.375]  They get the technocracy, they get the surveillance grid, they get the medical tyranny, they get us divided, they get us spying on each other, they get trillions of dollars, they get UN empowerment, they get corporate liability control, they get everything.
[02:22:16.548 --> 02:22:17.289]  Exactly.
[02:22:17.289 --> 02:22:22.071]  And is it a coincidence that about a month later, China really doesn't end up having lots of deaths?
[02:22:22.071 --> 02:22:24.993]  Like, originally the assumption was China was just lying about the deaths.
[02:22:24.993 --> 02:22:28.615]  But what if instead, China just did that whole thing for theater?
[02:22:28.615 --> 02:22:30.557]  And let's just say most of it was fake, it turned out.
[02:22:30.557 --> 02:22:31.877]  People falling down, dying.
[02:22:31.877 --> 02:22:33.438]  But it gets worse.
[02:22:33.438 --> 02:22:40.002]  Now China refuses to take the mRNA vaccines, so does India, and the rest of the world's banning it, and then we're the only ones basically getting it.
[02:22:40.002 --> 02:22:41.984]  I mean, this is incredible.
[02:22:41.984 --> 02:22:44.185]  They're telling us we've got to take this, but nobody else will?
[02:22:45.481 --> 02:22:51.800]  Yeah, well it tells you a lot about what China thinks about Bill Gates' vaccines, that nobody in China will take any of Bill Gates' vaccine.
[02:22:52.307 --> 02:22:54.308]  So it tells you what their real objective is.
[02:22:54.308 --> 02:22:56.289]  The objective was to control the West.
[02:22:56.289 --> 02:22:57.649]  And it worked.
[02:22:57.649 --> 02:22:58.169]  You look at me.
[02:22:58.169 --> 02:23:00.190]  Who came out the best economically?
[02:23:00.190 --> 02:23:00.730]  China.
[02:23:00.730 --> 02:23:02.191]  Who came out the best politically?
[02:23:02.191 --> 02:23:02.811]  China.
[02:23:02.811 --> 02:23:06.093]  Whose social credit system is now being exported across the Western world?
[02:23:06.093 --> 02:23:06.333]  China.
[02:23:06.333 --> 02:23:06.993]  And it gets worse.
[02:23:06.993 --> 02:23:07.833]  I'm sure you saw this.
[02:23:07.833 --> 02:23:11.355]  China announced yesterday, the Communist Party, you don't need to take it.
[02:23:11.355 --> 02:23:12.775]  We're not going to make anybody take it.
[02:23:12.775 --> 02:23:13.976]  No pressure there.
[02:23:13.976 --> 02:23:16.037]  You're not going to have a social credit score problem there.
[02:23:16.037 --> 02:23:16.757]  But here you will.
[02:23:18.121 --> 02:23:18.561]  Precisely.
[02:23:18.561 --> 02:23:19.301]  It's a giveaway.
[02:23:19.301 --> 02:23:20.282]  It's out in the open.
[02:23:20.282 --> 02:23:21.542]  It was the biggest scam.
[02:23:21.542 --> 02:23:27.484]  And the biggest success they had was they got rid of Donald Trump.
[02:23:27.484 --> 02:23:30.065]  Bill Gates' main adversary in this context.
[02:23:30.065 --> 02:23:33.426]  China's main adversary to their goals and objectives.
[02:23:33.426 --> 02:23:38.528]  So can it really be such a big coincidence that China may have done all of this deliberately?
[02:23:38.528 --> 02:23:39.108]  Oh, they did 100%.
[02:23:39.108 --> 02:23:41.329]  It's all as clear as the nose on our faces.
[02:23:41.329 --> 02:23:44.450]  We'll be right back in a few minutes with Robert Barnes and a bunch of other breaking news.
[02:23:44.450 --> 02:23:44.990]  Your phone calls.
[02:23:50.851 --> 02:23:58.173]  I'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off the successes and full wars I've had.
[02:23:58.173 --> 02:24:01.454]  If you're paying attention, you know we've done together.
[02:24:01.454 --> 02:24:10.576]  But I'll tell you this, the technocrats are really upping their game and they are trying to destroy all independent forms of media.
[02:24:11.340 --> 02:24:13.802]  They're trying to shudder and silence the human resistance.
[02:24:13.802 --> 02:24:19.426]  So, now is the time to understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate.
[02:24:19.426 --> 02:24:22.588]  Everything you warned your friends and family about is going to be true.
[02:24:22.588 --> 02:24:25.370]  So it's now that your credibility is way up.
[02:24:25.370 --> 02:24:29.754]  The power structures are to silence those of us that they can.
[02:24:29.754 --> 02:24:34.337]  But it's up to all of us to not let them silence any of us.
[02:24:34.337 --> 02:24:36.078]  We have the power.
[02:24:36.078 --> 02:24:39.401]  But the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech.
[02:24:40.373 --> 02:24:45.957]  We have to make sure that we fight hard right now to make sure that a long dark night doesn't come.
[02:24:45.957 --> 02:24:51.441]  So be the Paul Revere's you are.
[02:24:51.441 --> 02:24:57.425]  Your brain, your heart, your bones, your liver, your eyes, everything.
[02:24:59.108 --> 02:25:03.012]  Has a better shot at surviving in this crazy environment when you have high quality fish oil.
[02:25:03.012 --> 02:25:04.314]  We've got the best out there.
[02:25:04.314 --> 02:25:09.439]  We have the highest grade of fish oil available and what it does for your body is simply amazing.
[02:25:09.439 --> 02:25:15.926]  Everybody already knows what high quality fish oil does and it costs us even more to put it through a process to remove any trace mercury that's in it.
[02:25:15.926 --> 02:25:17.648]  This is also clean fish oil.
[02:25:17.648 --> 02:25:19.470]  It's been sold out for months but it's back in stock.
[02:25:20.350 --> 02:25:20.631]  50% off.
[02:25:20.631 --> 02:25:22.152]  Grill Oil is set to sell out.
[02:25:22.152 --> 02:25:23.773]  It's amazing as well.
[02:25:23.773 --> 02:25:29.577]  It's at 25% off, but when you get them both together in a combo, it's 50% off as well.

[02:25:47.889 --> 02:25:48.829]  Ultimate Fish Oil.
[02:25:48.829 --> 02:25:49.590]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:25:49.811 --> 02:25:50.555]  It's overstore.com.
[02:25:51.480 --> 02:26:00.825]  Fourteen months ago, I told you that the global lockdown was going to kill tens of millions of people by starvation and was going to cause a global depression in the first world.
[02:26:00.825 --> 02:26:01.865]  And now it has.
[02:26:01.865 --> 02:26:08.928]  It was a no-brainer then that you should get high-quality, storable food and save it because it is insurance you can eat.
[02:26:08.928 --> 02:26:13.410]  And with all the inflation we knew was coming, that was one way to beat inflation.
[02:26:13.410 --> 02:26:14.431]  A lot of you listened.
[02:26:14.431 --> 02:26:15.511]  You did a great job.
[02:26:15.511 --> 02:26:16.492]  Some of you didn't.
[02:26:16.492 --> 02:26:20.474]  Now is the time to take action before food prices only continue to increase
[02:26:20.834 --> 02:26:22.134]  Every index shows it.
[02:26:22.134 --> 02:26:25.195]  It's basically a guarantee, barring a miracle.
[02:26:25.195 --> 02:26:26.695]  And we wish it wasn't the case.
[02:26:26.695 --> 02:26:29.195]  But let's make lemonade out of these lemons.
[02:26:29.195 --> 02:26:37.497]  For only a few days more, until next Wednesday, May 12th, you can get 2020 prices still at preparewithalex.com.
[02:26:37.497 --> 02:26:44.738]  And then the prices are going to have to go back to what they were, still lower than most major competitors, and the food is the highest quality you're going to find.
[02:26:44.738 --> 02:26:46.718]  Preparewithalex.com.
[02:26:46.718 --> 02:26:47.718]  Take action now.
[02:26:47.718 --> 02:26:49.219]  Preparewithalex.com.
[02:26:49.219 --> 02:26:50.579]  Secure your food while you still can.
[02:26:51.448 --> 02:26:54.911]  Fourteen months ago, I began to sit on the broadcast every day.
[02:26:54.911 --> 02:26:58.094]  When the first world collapses, the third world dies.
[02:26:58.094 --> 02:27:09.985]  We have such a complex civilization with so many billions of moving parts, that when you shut down the first world, it causes a chain reaction that will devastate the third world and really hurt the first world.
[02:27:09.985 --> 02:27:12.988]  Well, now you're hearing about gas shortages all over the United States.
[02:27:13.568 --> 02:27:20.235]  That's because the companies and the systems and the drivers that can barely get the job done before delivering gas have been shut down.
[02:27:20.235 --> 02:27:23.398]  Plus the Keystone Pipeline has been shut down, along with other pipelines.
[02:27:23.398 --> 02:27:26.862]  The left is now blowing up dams across the U.S.
[02:27:26.862 --> 02:27:28.043]  We're being shut down.
[02:27:28.043 --> 02:27:30.065]  Our coal power plants are off as well.
[02:27:30.065 --> 02:27:32.488]  Ladies and gentlemen, prepare to be a total slave.
[02:27:33.008 --> 02:27:34.388]  The third world is imploding as well.
[02:27:34.388 --> 02:27:35.629]  The borders have been removed.
[02:27:35.629 --> 02:27:40.510]  Until you wake up and this is a globalist tri-com takeover, great reset, you have no hope.
[02:27:40.510 --> 02:27:45.572]  They're announcing that there will be less than two-thirds of the guests needed this summer.
[02:27:45.572 --> 02:27:55.074]  So they told you that you're under lockdown one way or another and CNN laughed at you and your family.
[02:27:55.074 --> 02:27:57.695]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:28:16.064 --> 02:28:31.492]  Alright, I'm going to make this video for you because I had to video it so that you'll believe me because, frankly,
[02:28:32.245 --> 02:28:34.626]  I didn't believe it myself.
[02:28:34.626 --> 02:28:43.191]  So, here's a brand new, sealed, perfectly sealed, brand new box of the J&J vaccine.
[02:28:43.191 --> 02:28:59.780]  You can see here, I'm going to break this open, and perfectly on top is this perfectly normal package insert.
[02:29:13.388 --> 02:29:15.309]  There's a lot of safety and efficacy data.
[02:29:15.309 --> 02:29:35.997]  In fact, all of the normal information that we would find in a package insert, like the ingredients, that would all be found right here in this package insert.
[02:29:35.997 --> 02:29:42.180]  Must be magic.
[02:29:42.180 --> 02:29:42.800]  It's all blank.
[02:29:43.559 --> 02:29:44.159]  The whole thing.
[02:29:44.159 --> 02:29:49.661]  Except for this part.
[02:29:49.661 --> 02:29:50.681]  That's the only thing not blank.
[02:29:50.681 --> 02:29:56.944]  Are you kidding me?
[02:29:56.944 --> 02:30:01.305]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, Robert Barnes is here with us and I also want to take calls but
[02:30:02.546 --> 02:30:04.887]  Some of those will have to be held in the next hour, but I will get to some.
[02:30:04.887 --> 02:30:09.828]  Ed and a few of the other callers have been holding a really long time, like Brian and others.
[02:30:09.828 --> 02:30:12.668]  But I do want to talk to you next hour and hear your stories about the vaccines.
[02:30:12.668 --> 02:30:14.029]  We really appreciate you holding.
[02:30:14.029 --> 02:30:19.350]  But there is a pharmacist showing there's no insert, and that's confirmed.
[02:30:19.350 --> 02:30:21.750]  So no paper trail, no testing, no nothing.
[02:30:21.750 --> 02:30:24.331]  And they're all over the national news saying this is the case.
[02:30:24.331 --> 02:30:25.311]  You've got to accept it.
[02:30:25.311 --> 02:30:28.472]  Just, you know, bow down and worship it all.
[02:30:30.977 --> 02:30:32.378]  How do you respond as a person?
[02:30:32.378 --> 02:30:34.018]  I mean, we've got to have pushback.
[02:30:34.018 --> 02:30:39.040]  CNN, MSNBC, they're all saying it's time to bully people.
[02:30:39.040 --> 02:30:44.862]  The Yankees and the Mets are saying, oh, the new thing is you'll be segregated if you're not vaccinated.
[02:30:44.862 --> 02:30:47.643]  And then your medical records are going to be on an iPhone.
[02:30:47.643 --> 02:30:52.264]  You've got to have a phone to be able to have a menu or a job or get on a plane.
[02:30:52.264 --> 02:30:56.026]  I mean, this is a total obvious big tech takeover.
[02:30:56.026 --> 02:30:59.547]  And then big tech is censoring everybody that tries to talk about it.
[02:31:02.125 --> 02:31:03.826]  And we've been talking about it for a year.
[02:31:03.826 --> 02:31:06.107]  You look at where Bill Gates' roadmap is.
[02:31:06.107 --> 02:31:11.090]  I mean, for a long time, Alex, you've always looked at the white papers to be able to predict where people are going to go.
[02:31:11.090 --> 02:31:20.635]  Well, I mean, what you've been doing, what we've been doing for a year, is you look at the patents that Bill Gates has been requesting, and it's going to go from your phone to inside your body.
[02:31:20.635 --> 02:31:23.156]  I mean, that's what a quantum tattoo does.
[02:31:23.156 --> 02:31:24.417]  It provides information.
[02:31:24.417 --> 02:31:26.798]  Bill Gates is even designing it so there's remote controls.
[02:31:26.798 --> 02:31:29.820]  Like, why do you need a remote control for something in your own body?
[02:31:29.820 --> 02:31:31.381]  Why does somebody else need that remote control?
[02:31:31.801 --> 02:31:36.545]  So the goal will be to have all that information right there on a little chip underneath your skin.
[02:31:36.545 --> 02:31:39.006]  That's what the quantum tattoo effectively is.
[02:31:39.006 --> 02:31:42.509]  One that monitors whether you've had the vaccines, what drugs you've had.
[02:31:42.509 --> 02:31:50.314]  Ultimately, it could be incorporated for other purposes, whether information, identification, currency, banking access, who knows where it could go.
[02:31:50.314 --> 02:31:52.816]  There's technology afoot that could all develop it.
[02:31:52.816 --> 02:31:57.319]  And we have to resist and push back against this Bill Gates dystopian nightmare.
[02:31:57.319 --> 02:31:59.521]  And that happens in three different spaces.
[02:32:00.021 --> 02:32:11.288]  One, the Court of Public Information and the Court of Public Opinion, and that's where what InfoWars is doing, what the InfoWars audience is doing, what ordinary people are doing, is critical, essential, and fundamental.
[02:32:11.288 --> 02:32:14.329]  Because a year ago, I guarantee you, they didn't think there'd be any problem.
[02:32:14.329 --> 02:32:16.651]  People can go back and watch a year and a half.
[02:32:16.651 --> 02:32:18.232]  Watch Event 201.
[02:32:18.232 --> 02:32:20.233]  Watch the closing arguments at Event 201.
[02:32:20.233 --> 02:32:23.935]  For those who may not know, Event 201 was sponsored by the Gates Foundation.
[02:32:24.555 --> 02:32:40.104]  Back in September of 2019, where they had leaders from the military, from big pharma, from big media, from governments across the country, talk about what would happen if we had a pandemic in response to a coronavirus pandemic.
[02:32:40.104 --> 02:32:43.585]  And so it's just a few months before it actually unearths on the world.
[02:32:43.585 --> 02:32:45.206]  And explain why that's important.
[02:32:45.206 --> 02:32:51.830]  We've caught foreign governments, major intelligence agencies, when they're going to stage a terror attack or a war, they'll run drills
[02:32:52.588 --> 02:32:52.968]  I don't think so.
[02:33:12.600 --> 02:33:18.989]  Yeah, it was both preconditioning people to accept this when it came out, and it was intelligence gathering.
[02:33:18.989 --> 02:33:23.034]  Gates found out what was weak and strong, and what was their main obsession?
[02:33:23.034 --> 02:33:26.659]  Their main obsession was having trusted sources of information.
[02:33:27.520 --> 02:33:31.504]  Six months before they said, now we've got to get the anti-vaxxers banned.
[02:33:31.504 --> 02:33:34.806]  It's not just the Trump people, it's the anti-vaxxers.
[02:33:34.806 --> 02:33:37.249]  We've got to get medical, it was all over the news.
[02:33:37.249 --> 02:33:38.330]  It was so obvious.
[02:33:38.330 --> 02:33:39.471]  Barnes, my God.
[02:33:39.471 --> 02:33:41.512]  And see, I'm not kissing your butt, but it's true.
[02:33:41.512 --> 02:33:44.835]  You're one of the few people I can get on that sees all the things I see.
[02:33:44.835 --> 02:33:47.538]  I mean, when you pull back and look at it, it's totally synthetic.
[02:33:47.538 --> 02:33:48.639]  Like, how did I know?
[02:33:49.457 --> 02:33:53.400]  When I was ten years old, that a new flavor of Coke was coming out, Coke Cherry.
[02:33:53.400 --> 02:33:56.042]  It was in every magazine, every newspaper, every TV ad.
[02:33:56.042 --> 02:33:58.223]  For six months, Coke Cherry, Coke Cherry, Coke Cherry.
[02:33:58.223 --> 02:34:11.473]  They're like, coronavirus is coming, we're gonna take all your rights, and no one's allowed to question it, and there's gonna be checkpoints, and martial law, and here's all the drills, and get ready for it, and vaccines are safe, and you must take them, and then, boom, this happens.
[02:34:11.473 --> 02:34:12.414]  This is ridiculous!
[02:34:13.504 --> 02:34:13.944]  Oh, exactly.
[02:34:13.944 --> 02:34:15.745]  And people can watch it for themselves.
[02:34:15.745 --> 02:34:18.786]  They videotaped some of those conferences at Event 201.
[02:34:18.786 --> 02:34:24.747]  You can still see them on YouTube, where they're talking about what was their main group of disinformation they were worried about?
[02:34:24.747 --> 02:34:26.468]  People connected to vaccines.
[02:34:26.468 --> 02:34:36.271]  Another little insightful thing, by the way, was during that is one of them says, you know, the problem is most pandemics only last a couple of months, and that's not quick enough to get a vaccine up and running.
[02:34:36.571 --> 02:34:52.196]  Well, so what they learned from that is they needed to extend the length of this pandemic in order to justify having a vaccine in the first place as any conceivable solution, and then get people to forget the fact that vaccines take several years for even the metal U.S.
[02:34:52.196 --> 02:34:54.616]  medical authorities to call them safe.
[02:34:54.616 --> 02:34:57.117]  And that's why these are not safe according to their own U.S.
[02:34:57.117 --> 02:34:57.837]  medical standards.
[02:34:57.837 --> 02:34:59.558]  And let's be clear, you may get a batch
[02:35:00.542 --> 02:35:00.602]  Yes.
[02:35:21.451 --> 02:35:23.014]  My uncle almost died from a tetanus shot.
[02:35:23.014 --> 02:35:24.556]  My dad's brother was in the hospital for two weeks.
[02:35:24.556 --> 02:35:25.778]  He swole up and almost died.
[02:35:25.778 --> 02:35:27.000]  He was a young man then.
[02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:33.831]  So what I'm saying is we all know these stories, but this isn't just old-fashioned vaccines that had problems that they tried to deny.
[02:35:33.831 --> 02:35:35.434]  This is a whole new kettle of fish.
[02:35:36.647 --> 02:35:37.187]  Oh, completely!
[02:35:37.187 --> 02:35:47.914]  I mean, for people who, I mean, the worst consequence ever of a screwed up vaccine experimentation was what happened with the polio vaccine in the Belgian Congo, and that likely was the source of AIDS.
[02:35:47.914 --> 02:35:54.018]  I mean, so that, when you talk about unintended consequences, I was debating this with some friends about why, you know, why worry about the vaccine.
[02:35:54.018 --> 02:36:04.945]  I'm like, we're not going to know about the worst consequences about the vaccine likely until years from now, and there's lots of historical examples of that being really, really, really bad, much worse than a pandemic could ever be.
[02:36:05.305 --> 02:36:08.127]  And that's why we have to fight back and we have to push back.
[02:36:08.127 --> 02:36:17.234]  But the first way, I mean I'm doing what I can in the legal arena, others are doing what they can in the political arena, but what the entire audience is doing in the court of public opinion is equally essential.
[02:36:17.234 --> 02:36:20.177]  Their goal is to not have these voices heard.
[02:36:20.177 --> 02:36:23.099]  And their goal is to take this interview once it is
[02:36:23.659 --> 02:36:24.841]  Post it at Van.Video.
[02:36:24.841 --> 02:36:27.163]  Our goal is for all of you to share it.
[02:36:27.163 --> 02:36:28.265]  This is truth.
[02:36:28.265 --> 02:36:29.426]  This is key.
[02:36:29.426 --> 02:36:30.387]  This is reality.
[02:36:30.387 --> 02:36:31.709]  Listeners need to understand their power.
[02:36:31.709 --> 02:36:38.537]  I know most of them do, but as more and more of our listeners realize that and repost and cut clips out and share it, it's having a huge effect right now.
[02:36:39.637 --> 02:36:40.197]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:36:40.197 --> 02:36:48.699]  And the InfoWars audience that was doing things like getting vitamin D, things that they're now recognizing were valuable all along but were trying to pretend otherwise before.
[02:36:48.699 --> 02:36:51.799]  I mean, I get the Winter Sun product.
[02:36:51.799 --> 02:36:56.740]  The people that were doing that were actually in much better, healthier space than those who were not.
[02:36:56.740 --> 02:37:02.241]  And there was a continued effort to sort of deny that and pretend otherwise because they wanted to make the vaccine the only solution.
[02:37:02.241 --> 02:37:08.782]  By law, they couldn't get emergency authorization unless there was no other mediation or treatment like ivermectin or hydroxychloroquine.
[02:37:09.645 --> 02:37:10.586]  That's exactly right.
[02:37:10.586 --> 02:37:17.375]  That's why there was a war on that, because that's the precondition for an emergency use authorization under the law, is that there be no other therapeutic effect.
[02:37:17.375 --> 02:37:20.800]  And again, day one they were ready, a year and two months ago, it shows.
[02:37:20.800 --> 02:37:26.848]  They've been lockstep, following a script, which is what the Rockefeller plan for all this is called Operation Lockstep.
[02:37:28.172 --> 02:37:28.572]  Exactly.
[02:37:28.572 --> 02:37:29.633]  And this goes way back.
[02:37:29.633 --> 02:37:32.615]  The Rockefellers have been thinking about this for many, many decades.
[02:37:32.615 --> 02:37:33.796]  This has been an elite agenda.
[02:37:33.796 --> 02:37:36.417]  You were funding viruses to give you cancer in the 20s.
[02:37:36.417 --> 02:37:36.818]  Stay there.
[02:37:36.818 --> 02:37:37.918]  Robert Barnes is on fire.
[02:37:37.918 --> 02:37:38.759]  He's probably got to go.
[02:37:38.759 --> 02:37:39.279]  But I'm going to see.
[02:37:39.279 --> 02:37:40.800]  So I want to go to your calls next segment.
[02:37:40.800 --> 02:37:48.065]  I can twist his arm, do a few more segments next hour, get the Chauvin federal indictment, Trump, the recount, and so much more.
[02:37:48.065 --> 02:37:49.146]  He's nodding his head.
[02:37:49.146 --> 02:37:49.706]  Hopefully you can.
[02:37:49.706 --> 02:37:50.587]  We'll see.
[02:37:50.587 --> 02:37:53.328]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021.
[02:37:54.838 --> 02:37:55.898]  And I just want to say something.
[02:37:55.898 --> 02:38:00.740]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over the years.
[02:38:00.740 --> 02:38:05.662]  It is truly an answer to prayer, and I am so blessed and thankful for all of you, the listeners of this show.
[02:38:05.662 --> 02:38:08.563]  I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you.
[02:38:08.563 --> 02:38:11.924]  Whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter.
[02:38:11.924 --> 02:38:13.144]  You've got red blood.
[02:38:13.144 --> 02:38:19.287]  And if you love freedom and justice, and if you love our innocent children, we are brothers and sisters together.
[02:38:19.287 --> 02:38:22.908]  And it has just been an incredible experience to work with you over the years.
[02:38:23.608 --> 02:38:27.471]  And as crazy as things are, I want to keep working into the future.
[02:38:27.471 --> 02:38:30.354]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[02:38:30.354 --> 02:38:35.237]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us.
[02:38:35.237 --> 02:38:37.839]  Again, that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[02:38:37.839 --> 02:38:42.283]  I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've done.
[02:38:42.283 --> 02:38:46.386]  And just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you.
[02:38:46.386 --> 02:38:49.368]  And hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support InfoWars.
[02:38:49.368 --> 02:38:49.729]  God bless.
[02:38:50.501 --> 02:38:57.044]  When listeners call into the show and thank me for all I've done, I always stop them and I say, thank you for what you've done.
[02:38:57.044 --> 02:38:59.005]  Thank you for keeping InfoWars on the air.
[02:38:59.005 --> 02:39:00.445]  Thank you for praying for us.
[02:39:00.445 --> 02:39:02.766]  And thank you for spreading the word.
[02:39:02.766 --> 02:39:13.191]  If all of you will simply go to InfoWarsStore.com and get a privacy pocket for your iPhone or Droid, it will teach you and others that these things are surveilling you.
[02:39:13.191 --> 02:39:18.593]  It will remind you every day, like it does me and my family, and it will protect where you go and what you do.
[02:39:19.133 --> 02:39:25.097]  Not because you've done something wrong, but because the big telecoms, big tech, and the globalists are predatory and are evil.
[02:39:25.097 --> 02:39:31.602]  And in this surveillance state, we need to more and more start doing everything we can to mitigate the criminal activity they're involved in.
[02:39:31.602 --> 02:39:34.084]  These are the highest quality, highest ratings.
[02:39:34.084 --> 02:39:36.626]  They're available at InfoWareStore.com in four different colors.
[02:39:37.206 --> 02:39:38.347]  And they are only $19.95.
[02:39:38.347 --> 02:39:43.112]  The exact same pocket is sold for $24.95 or even $29.95 everywhere.
[02:39:43.112 --> 02:39:46.315]  They're available right now for $19.95 and they fund the InfoWarp.
[02:39:46.315 --> 02:39:51.680]  Please take action today, protect your privacy, and fund the InfoWarp.
[02:39:51.680 --> 02:39:58.626]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone from beta testing to operational.
[02:39:59.173 --> 02:40:04.697]  The globalists are out in the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot takeover.
[02:40:04.697 --> 02:40:12.562]  But the good news is we've been working, and you've been working, and others have been working across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to fight it off.
[02:40:12.562 --> 02:40:14.043]  Humanity is strong.
[02:40:14.043 --> 02:40:15.004]  We're incredible.
[02:40:15.004 --> 02:40:18.786]  And if we're aware of the attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating it.
[02:40:18.786 --> 02:40:21.248]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[02:40:21.248 --> 02:40:27.172]  So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential, and warning others is absolutely essential.
[02:40:27.572 --> 02:40:37.236]  At the same time, supporting InfoWars by buying high quality products to keep us on air is essential because they're great products for you and your family, and they're also funding our operation.
[02:40:37.236 --> 02:40:39.558]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:40:39.558 --> 02:40:42.199]  InfoWarsStore.com is incredible.
[02:40:42.199 --> 02:40:47.541]  A lot of our products that have been sold out because of supply chain breakdowns are back in, like bodies, bazzo beats, and others.
[02:40:47.541 --> 02:40:51.523]  So get them today at InfoWarsStore.com, and I thank you for being part of the resistance.
[02:40:52.600 --> 02:40:59.183]  The federal government commissioned secret radiation experiments on thousands of non-consenting patients.
[02:40:59.183 --> 02:41:01.525]  Hundreds of hospitals in the U.S.
[02:41:01.525 --> 02:41:11.470]  injected healthy men, women, and children with uranium and plutonium at dosage levels ranging from non-therapeutic to lethal, killing many of the test subjects.
[02:41:12.558 --> 02:41:16.980]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement, is one of the most important films ever made.
[02:41:16.980 --> 02:41:23.644]  14 years ago, we tracked and documented the Bilderberg Group's activities and their plan for a great reset using the threat of a fake virus.
[02:41:23.644 --> 02:41:25.324]  The film now is more important than ever.
[02:41:25.324 --> 02:41:28.086]  When it shot to number one on Amazon last year, they banned it.
[02:41:28.086 --> 02:41:29.847]  We have it back in print, available now.
[02:41:30.487 --> 02:41:32.248]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:42:06.559 --> 02:42:11.521]  All right, you got Robert Barnes who's filing suit next week with Robert Kennedy Jr.
[02:42:11.521 --> 02:42:15.983]  That is a big, big deal against the folks violating the Nuremberg Code.
[02:42:15.983 --> 02:42:20.524]  And so I appreciate listeners that have been holding, Ed and many others.
[02:42:20.524 --> 02:42:24.006]  Barnes is going to do 20 minutes to the next hour on some other subjects, and we'll go back to your calls.
[02:42:24.006 --> 02:42:27.567]  But I'm going to go to calls right now on the vaccines.
[02:42:27.567 --> 02:42:30.268]  And so let's go ahead and talk to Ed in Ohio.
[02:42:30.268 --> 02:42:31.348]  Thanks for holding over.
[02:42:31.348 --> 02:42:33.409]  Repeat what's going on with your grandmother.
[02:42:33.409 --> 02:42:34.469]  And then you got Robert Barnes here.
[02:42:34.469 --> 02:42:35.770]  Have you got any comments or questions for him?
[02:42:37.188 --> 02:42:38.409]  Yes, sir.
[02:42:38.409 --> 02:42:49.897]  Well, my grandmother and grandfather, against my advisement, went and got the shot and her liver is shutting down.
[02:42:49.897 --> 02:42:57.783]  They tested her and her bilirubin count was absolutely off the chart, they said.
[02:42:57.783 --> 02:43:03.027]  The questions that I had for Mr. Barnes was
[02:43:07.603 --> 02:43:16.970]  About legal things with... I've been using 42 U.S.
[02:43:16.970 --> 02:43:26.378]  Code Subsection 2000 for the places that are trying to tell me I can't come in because, well, this is a private business.
[02:43:26.378 --> 02:43:31.262]  But under that, it says it is a point of public access.
[02:43:31.262 --> 02:43:33.904]  I wanted to get his take and anything that
[02:43:34.682 --> 02:43:36.783]  He could think to recommend.
[02:43:36.783 --> 02:43:39.705]  I'm putting together a packet currently to go out.
[02:43:39.705 --> 02:43:40.465]  What do you say?
[02:43:40.465 --> 02:43:44.768]  You're trying to go to the grocery store, especially for old folks that can't go 20 miles away to another one.
[02:43:44.768 --> 02:43:47.729]  They want you to wear a mask, but you've got emphysema.
[02:43:47.729 --> 02:43:49.690]  You've got anxiety disorders, whatever.
[02:43:49.690 --> 02:43:52.572]  They're illegally trying to make you wear a burka.
[02:43:52.572 --> 02:43:56.734]  What is a good legal response for the average person without you giving them individual advice?
[02:43:56.734 --> 02:44:01.797]  You don't know the case, but what would you do, Barnes?
[02:44:01.797 --> 02:44:02.557]  Turn your mic back on.
[02:44:02.557 --> 02:44:03.038]  Start over.
[02:44:03.038 --> 02:44:03.278]  Go ahead.
[02:44:05.069 --> 02:44:26.020]  We've actually filed suit against a range of places, including grocery stores, including hospitals, including medical facilities, including educational institutions, because where they were trying to require a mask for people who are exempted from the mask due to their health condition, which can include also anxiety, but also breathing issues, other issues.
[02:44:26.580 --> 02:44:35.005]  And so we're suing under the ADA, the Discrimination Act that prohibits discrimination against anyone who is perceived as disabled.
[02:44:35.005 --> 02:44:43.429]  We're going to be doing the same thing actually in the context of the vaccines, because my view is that requiring someone to have a vaccine is a perception that they're disabled.
[02:44:43.749 --> 02:44:57.737]  And then treating them differently based on that perception is discriminating against them based on your perception of their disability and that too is prohibited by the ADA and state analogous laws that are also similar that have the same principles and precepts in place.
[02:44:57.737 --> 02:44:58.757]  That's what I should have pointed out.
[02:44:58.757 --> 02:45:00.098]  You've already followed a bunch of suits.
[02:45:00.098 --> 02:45:01.239]  You're a real trooper, Barnes.
[02:45:02.646 --> 02:45:04.587]  Yeah, well, we've already started firing away.
[02:45:04.587 --> 02:45:08.530]  So on the mass cases, we already have several suits filed across the country.
[02:45:08.530 --> 02:45:11.311]  We're filing more across the country.
[02:45:11.311 --> 02:45:16.054]  Hey, can you come on the War Room today or maybe next week come on my show and just talk about the suits themselves?
[02:45:16.054 --> 02:45:16.994]  Because this is fascinating.
[02:45:16.994 --> 02:45:17.675]  We need to fight back.
[02:45:18.800 --> 02:45:19.601]  Oh yes, absolutely.
[02:45:19.601 --> 02:45:20.442]  We'll do.
[02:45:20.442 --> 02:45:22.804]  And I'll be drafting some letters.
[02:45:22.804 --> 02:45:27.570]  I'm going to be putting up the suits on a website so that people can see them.
[02:45:27.570 --> 02:45:33.216]  There won't be any copyright asserted, so people can copy and paste and do whatever they want with them.
[02:45:33.216 --> 02:45:37.400]  You know, it's not legal advice, but whatever you do with it, that's up to you.
[02:45:37.400 --> 02:45:39.783]  And if you want to utilize it a certain way, God bless you.
[02:45:40.143 --> 02:45:49.531]  So we did the same thing back during the election context and got a bunch of people to write letters to their congressmen and senators that led to a very effective part of that campaign politically.
[02:45:49.531 --> 02:45:54.335]  We're going to do the same thing so that people can see, what can I explain to my employer?
[02:45:54.335 --> 02:45:56.437]  What can I explain to my educational institution?
[02:45:59.517 --> 02:46:02.542]  School board meetings and people don't wear masks and say we don't want to wear masks.
[02:46:02.542 --> 02:46:03.965]  The police are investigating.
[02:46:03.965 --> 02:46:05.447]  Well, we're investigating you.
[02:46:05.447 --> 02:46:09.314]  You know, the human smugglers, the borders open, the masks give you bacterial pneumonia.
[02:46:09.314 --> 02:46:10.716]  It's all a damn fraud.
[02:46:10.716 --> 02:46:11.518]  Knock it off!
[02:46:12.028 --> 02:46:14.609]  It's supposed to be 15 days to cut the curve.
[02:46:14.609 --> 02:46:16.971]  No, it's going to be 50 million years of slavery.
[02:46:16.971 --> 02:46:18.151]  They don't say no.
[02:46:18.151 --> 02:46:18.952]  So there you go, Ed.
[02:46:18.952 --> 02:46:20.373]  Yeah, that's what my wife does.
[02:46:20.373 --> 02:46:22.834]  She says, hey, I have a disability.
[02:46:22.834 --> 02:46:23.694]  She has anxiety over it.
[02:46:23.694 --> 02:46:24.095]  I do too.
[02:46:24.095 --> 02:46:25.255]  I mean, I literally hate it.
[02:46:25.255 --> 02:46:26.356]  I mean, we're in a burka.
[02:46:26.356 --> 02:46:29.297]  And when they get rude, she goes, hey, back off.
[02:46:29.297 --> 02:46:30.638]  And they always back off.
[02:46:30.638 --> 02:46:32.279]  And now people go, I agree with you.
[02:46:32.279 --> 02:46:33.660]  And now they don't even mess with us.
[02:46:33.660 --> 02:46:35.181]  You've got to push back.
[02:46:35.181 --> 02:46:35.921]  Thanks for the call, Ed.
[02:46:37.097 --> 02:46:38.378]  James is a paramedical.
[02:46:38.378 --> 02:46:40.799]  I really appreciate holding in his busy time.
[02:46:40.799 --> 02:46:41.679]  We got so many calls, though.
[02:46:41.679 --> 02:46:43.100]  That just goes to territory.
[02:46:43.100 --> 02:46:46.782]  He's a paramedic because he treated three separate patients having reactions.
[02:46:46.782 --> 02:46:49.604]  James, tell us about it.
[02:46:49.604 --> 02:46:52.845]  Yeah, Mr. Jones, I really appreciate you taking my call.
[02:46:52.845 --> 02:46:58.608]  I do need some time to discuss this because people have to listen to what I have to say.
[02:46:58.608 --> 02:47:03.531]  There is a compromised, the cities and the fire departments are compromised.
[02:47:04.219 --> 02:47:09.162]  And we are not able to really help the people that we need to be helping here, and people have to hear this.
[02:47:09.162 --> 02:47:18.568]  So you have to give them the time to be able to talk about how they're compromised, what I saw, how we're not able to document, and you've got to let me plug.
[02:47:18.568 --> 02:47:31.016]  Tell folks with your, because I really respect paramedics, doctors will tell you they know as much, way more than nurses, because you're there when you first get there, you're saving lives, you're having to do medical procedures, and you actually get to learn what's really going on.
[02:47:31.016 --> 02:47:32.517]  So give us your view on what you're witnessing.
[02:47:33.869 --> 02:47:41.393]  Yeah, so if you remember when Gates said that, you know, they could hire a whole bunch more teachers if we just call the herd, if we just let the older people die?
[02:47:41.393 --> 02:47:44.975]  Yeah, he said, get rid of grandma, we can hire 10 teachers, but that's a death panel.
[02:47:44.975 --> 02:47:46.896]  You're not supposed to say that.
[02:47:46.896 --> 02:47:47.856]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:47:47.856 --> 02:47:51.818]  He is, this whole process, it's 100%, that's what they're doing.
[02:47:51.818 --> 02:47:57.841]  If you think about the teacher union, the leadership right now, that's exactly why these schools are not open, that they're a part of this process.
[02:47:58.419 --> 02:48:01.321]  And I know the teachers are good, just like the firefighters are good.
[02:48:01.321 --> 02:48:06.865]  But sure, the unions want to get rid of regular schooling, and they want to get rid of the old people for their pension funds.
[02:48:06.865 --> 02:48:08.687]  This is a cult.
[02:48:08.687 --> 02:48:09.607]  Yep.
[02:48:09.607 --> 02:48:14.611]  Look, I'm an IFF firefighter here, a career firefighter, and volunteers the same way.
[02:48:14.611 --> 02:48:15.992]  We are a majority conservative.
[02:48:15.992 --> 02:48:17.633]  We want to be out there protecting the community.
[02:48:17.633 --> 02:48:19.755]  I took an oath to help people, right?
[02:48:19.755 --> 02:48:22.917]  I am pissed off right now because I just came off a 24-hour shift.
[02:48:22.917 --> 02:48:24.418]  I'm getting a little emotional here.
[02:48:25.469 --> 02:48:33.906]  24-hour shift and I'm seeing people getting sick and dying and not being able to survive what they're getting out of this vaccine and people have to hear this.
[02:48:33.906 --> 02:48:35.269]  Well, tell people what you're witnessing, sir.
[02:48:35.928 --> 02:48:39.349]  All right, so look, the cities and the fire departments are compromised, okay?
[02:48:39.349 --> 02:48:44.871]  They're all getting federal money, tax money, right, to push the vaccine, to give vaccines.
[02:48:44.871 --> 02:48:47.872]  I got people right now in our agency that are pushing vaccines.
[02:48:47.872 --> 02:48:57.015]  We got to go out there, and the firefighters are getting overtime for doing it, and the cities and the fire departments are getting a ton of tax money that's helping, you know, getting costs and additional revenue.
[02:48:57.015 --> 02:48:58.775]  So it's in their best interest to do it, right?
[02:48:58.775 --> 02:49:00.136]  They're all compromised.
[02:49:00.136 --> 02:49:03.597]  The people that we're seeing, let me tell you how this worked out in the state of Washington, right?
[02:49:03.597 --> 02:49:04.317]  Governor Inslee
[02:49:04.707 --> 02:49:07.429]  You know, it was putting sick people into the retirement homes, right?
[02:49:07.429 --> 02:49:11.591]  I have a large majority of people that are in my first-year area.
[02:49:11.591 --> 02:49:14.272]  Sure, it's not just Cuomo.
[02:49:14.272 --> 02:49:17.014]  It was a strategic plan also in Europe.
[02:49:17.014 --> 02:49:19.035]  They put sick people in to kill the old.
[02:49:19.035 --> 02:49:20.836]  That's what you see.
[02:49:20.836 --> 02:49:23.398]  That's why we ought to put these puzzle pieces together, okay?
[02:49:23.398 --> 02:49:25.639]  They put the sick people into these retirement homes, right?
[02:49:26.284 --> 02:49:27.605]  People are already compromised, right?
[02:49:27.605 --> 02:49:31.086]  So, we have healthier, younger people that have COVID that went in.
[02:49:31.086 --> 02:49:38.750]  They got sick, but what we were seeing here in January and February were these places would just have all of a sudden the entire complex would be sick with COVID, okay?
[02:49:38.750 --> 02:49:40.171]  Now, a lot of people would recover, right?
[02:49:40.171 --> 02:49:42.672]  But they weren't able to get the therapeutic, okay?
[02:49:42.672 --> 02:49:49.115]  So, now when the people get sick in these places, they're getting the therapeutics and they'll have 100% recovery rate, all right?
[02:49:49.115 --> 02:49:53.677]  So, what we saw at the very beginning was people were coming in, they were getting sick, infecting everybody, right?
[02:49:54.167 --> 02:50:09.540]  Okay, and now when we gave the COVID vaccines to all these retirement homes and all these older people, within two weeks to a month, they were all getting, not all, a lot of patients were coming down with some unexplained illness, even though they were isolated, not even able to come out of their apartments or rooms, right?
[02:50:09.540 --> 02:50:11.421]  They were getting some unexplained illness, right?
[02:50:11.421 --> 02:50:16.185]  And so all of a sudden, it's fatigue, they couldn't move, paralysis, all kinds of things.
[02:50:16.185 --> 02:50:20.809]  And we saw a lot of healthy people that have no underlying health conditions that just happen to be older,
[02:50:21.821 --> 02:50:24.623]  Have these issues, and they're unexplained, right?
[02:50:24.623 --> 02:50:42.397]  Okay, now what we're seeing—now we're six weeks to two months out, and now we're seeing people—I just saw three patients yesterday that, right now, I'm just letting everyone know, right, that coincidence is the leading cause of illness right now with these vaccines.
[02:50:42.397 --> 02:50:45.239]  Okay, coincidence, because everyone doesn't want to admit it, okay?
[02:50:45.239 --> 02:50:50.023]  I had one 76-year-old female patient that had a severe stroke debilitating.
[02:50:50.023 --> 02:50:50.944]  She will not recover.
[02:50:51.573 --> 02:50:55.455]  Because that she was post 6 weeks from this vaccine.
[02:50:55.455 --> 02:50:58.657]  No underlying medical conditions never had an issue before.
[02:50:58.657 --> 02:51:00.358]  Okay, but another 1 that.
[02:51:00.751 --> 02:51:04.494]  Within two weeks, had a rapid onset of dementia.
[02:51:04.494 --> 02:51:06.856]  No pre-existing conditions, no medical issues.
[02:51:06.856 --> 02:51:08.597]  She was in her seventies.
[02:51:08.597 --> 02:51:11.900]  And by the way, sir, we're going up to break here, but you've heard the callers.
[02:51:11.900 --> 02:51:13.141]  They're all saying the same thing.
[02:51:13.141 --> 02:51:16.304]  And did you see the UT study saying exactly what you said?
[02:51:16.304 --> 02:51:24.811]  And other studies, brain fog, protein in the brain, autoimmune response, the lungs, the heart, the brain, your body starts eating your organs.
[02:51:25.874 --> 02:51:27.054]  You gotta let me keep going here.
[02:51:27.054 --> 02:51:28.835]  If I gotta hold a little break, I'll do it, okay?
[02:51:28.835 --> 02:51:31.296]  I know, but Barnes is here with the other callers.
[02:51:31.296 --> 02:51:31.896]  Tell us the rest.
[02:51:31.896 --> 02:51:33.096]  Tell us what else you saw.
[02:51:33.096 --> 02:51:41.439]  So, hey, and then I saw a 21-year-old person at Rite Aid, right, that collapsed after receiving, within five minutes, collapsed.
[02:51:41.439 --> 02:51:42.499]  She was totally out of it.
[02:51:43.101 --> 02:51:50.086]  Her blood pressure was super low, blood sugar was low, you know, but just all of a sudden, like, she was just out and was really having a hard time.
[02:51:50.086 --> 02:51:50.926]  You know what I'm going to do, sir?
[02:51:50.926 --> 02:51:53.888]  You're a well-spoken fellow, and what I'll do is, we'll contact you.
[02:51:53.888 --> 02:51:55.089]  You can trust us.
[02:51:55.089 --> 02:51:58.291]  We want a copy of your ID, because we know you're a real paramedic.
[02:51:58.291 --> 02:52:04.175]  We'll say we vetted you, and then we'll have you on as a guest for 30 minutes with me or with Owen Schroer or one of the other shows.
[02:52:04.175 --> 02:52:04.836]  Get his name and number.
[02:52:05.716 --> 02:52:06.417]  I gotta go, sir.
[02:52:06.417 --> 02:52:07.257]  I gotta go.
[02:52:07.257 --> 02:52:08.238]  We're up to the break.
[02:52:08.238 --> 02:52:08.858]  Got Barnes here.
[02:52:08.858 --> 02:52:09.799]  He's gotta go soon.
[02:52:09.799 --> 02:52:11.020]  We're gonna get to all the other callers.
[02:52:11.020 --> 02:52:13.181]  But James is a normal person.
[02:52:13.181 --> 02:52:14.322]  He's upset.
[02:52:14.322 --> 02:52:15.563]  He's witnessing it all.
[02:52:15.563 --> 02:52:16.323]  He's pissed.
[02:52:16.323 --> 02:52:17.024]  Give his name and number.
[02:52:17.688 --> 02:52:26.251]  We'll get his, these are all real people calling, but we're gonna have him on as a guest, we vet it, and then we can have a paramedic on to tell you what he's seeing in the Bill Gates state of Washington.
[02:52:26.251 --> 02:52:29.292]  Hour number four straight ahead with Robert Barnes to comment on that.
[02:52:29.292 --> 02:52:41.757]  More calls, then we're gonna get the new indictments with the Justice Department, the Chauvin trial, and other officers, and so much more, and Antifa setting up checkpoints all over the country.
[02:52:41.757 --> 02:52:43.578]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut.
[02:52:43.578 --> 02:52:44.538]  You're on the air, thanks for holding.
[02:52:45.646 --> 02:52:46.287]  I sure can, sir.
[02:52:46.287 --> 02:52:46.707]  Thank you.
[02:52:46.707 --> 02:52:47.367]  Hey, Alex.
[02:52:47.367 --> 02:52:53.592]  Before I start, man, I just wanted to talk to you, bro, and it's a pleasure to be talking right now with you, man.
[02:52:53.592 --> 02:52:54.933]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[02:52:54.933 --> 02:52:59.056]  I'm calling from New Brent, Connecticut, and I just want to plug in.
[02:52:59.056 --> 02:53:03.159]  I'm a truck driver, and two befores have changed the way I drive.
[02:53:03.159 --> 02:53:07.602]  Me and my brothers that drive, and a couple of us, we're all Hispanics.
[02:53:09.143 --> 02:53:24.532]  Well, brother, we put more in this than any other long-term, high-quality energy powder there is.
[02:53:24.532 --> 02:53:26.813]  So this was designed by one of the top guys in the country.
[02:53:26.813 --> 02:53:31.956]  He didn't want his name on it because, obviously, the political issues, but we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it.
[02:53:31.956 --> 02:53:34.738]  And we believe it is the best, strongest, but healthiest
[02:53:34.898 --> 02:53:37.962]  Your brain, your heart, your bones, your liver, your eyes, everything!
[02:53:49.398 --> 02:53:53.301]  has a better shot at surviving in this crazy environment when you have high quality fish oil.

[02:53:54.601 --> 02:53:59.725]  We have the highest grade of fish oil available and what it does for your body is simply amazing.
[02:53:59.725 --> 02:54:06.189]  Everybody already knows what high quality fish oil does and it costs us even more to put it through a process to remove any trace mercury that's in it.
[02:54:06.189 --> 02:54:07.950]  This is also clean fish oil.
[02:54:07.950 --> 02:54:10.912]  It's been sold out for months but it's back in stock 50% off.
[02:54:10.912 --> 02:54:12.453]  Krill oil is set to sell out.
[02:54:12.453 --> 02:54:13.494]  It's amazing as well.
[02:54:14.074 --> 02:54:19.879]  It's at 25% off, but when you get them both together in a combo, it's 50% off as well.

[02:54:44.671 --> 02:54:53.793]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:53.793 --> 02:54:55.634]  Alright, Robert Barnes is our guest.
[02:54:55.634 --> 02:54:57.274]  He just heard that desperate paramedic.
[02:55:08.323 --> 02:55:16.531]  Who wanted to stay on it is telling us, you know, three calls a day, people collapsing, people getting sick, people dying, old people can't get out of bed.
[02:55:16.531 --> 02:55:20.635]  We've had the nursing home managers call and they go, yeah, we've got 20 people, we've got 50, we've got 100.
[02:55:20.635 --> 02:55:22.316]  It's always the same story.
[02:55:22.316 --> 02:55:24.098]  Suddenly, none of them come to dinner for a week.
[02:55:24.098 --> 02:55:26.240]  None of them start dying.
[02:55:26.240 --> 02:55:28.061]  This was all pre-planned, Barnes.
[02:55:28.061 --> 02:55:31.865]  I mean, clearly, we can see the design.
[02:55:31.865 --> 02:55:32.826]  They administered a plan.
[02:55:33.539 --> 02:55:35.640]  Will they get away with it?
[02:55:35.640 --> 02:55:39.361]  I think and I know they're getting a lot more pushback than I think they thought they'd get.
[02:55:39.361 --> 02:55:41.222]  What do you think?
[02:55:41.222 --> 02:55:41.782]  No doubt about it.
[02:55:41.782 --> 02:55:48.285]  I mean, they definitely got a lot more pushback from the court of public opinion because in part of shows like this and audiences like these.
[02:55:48.285 --> 02:55:58.889]  Because you just look at two years ago, public opinion about if you labeled a drug vaccine, magically you would get 90% plus approvals that think it's completely safe, totally effective, no problems.
[02:55:59.409 --> 02:56:05.793]  Because the last two decades they've been very effective suppressing the memory that, you know, a drug is a drug.
[02:56:05.793 --> 02:56:08.315]  You can put any label on it you want, it's still a drug.
[02:56:08.315 --> 02:56:11.897]  And just calling it a vaccine doesn't make it magically from God.
[02:56:11.897 --> 02:56:26.746]  And so it's still a drug made by a drug company, or the state in some capacity, and there's a long notorious history of that not turning out well, a long notorious history of them lying about it, a long notorious history of it backfiring just a few years, sometimes many decades later.
[02:56:26.766 --> 02:56:33.708]  What are they going to do when the majority of medical doctors, nurses, and pharmacists I know on the street say it's pure bull?
[02:56:33.708 --> 02:56:40.030]  And I was talking to a high-level UT board member yesterday, and they said, no, my doctor said don't take it, it's not safe.
[02:56:40.030 --> 02:56:42.971]  So, I mean, the majority of doctors know this is bad.
[02:56:44.441 --> 02:56:49.327]  Oh, I mean, many, well, you look at it, disproportionately doctors and nurses are the ones that are not willing to take it.
[02:56:49.327 --> 02:56:58.837]  I mean, now you have about 30 to 40 percent of the country that has concerns about taking this vaccine, about the safety and efficacy of it, about being reluctant to take it.
[02:56:58.837 --> 02:57:06.325]  They'll never be able to bully a number, that's why they want to get us down to maybe 10 percent and they want to practice bullying us, but they're not getting to the manageable level, are they?
[02:57:07.381 --> 02:57:07.921]  Not at all.
[02:57:07.921 --> 02:57:17.384]  And that's why they started waging war with government-complicit participants against Bobby Kennedy's organization and the Children's Health Defense, the Defender.
[02:57:17.384 --> 02:57:36.271]  Because they have a suit that's actually pending in California that arguments are taking place this week about whether it can go forward against Facebook, against Zuckerberg, on the grounds that Zuckerberg was acting as a secret agent of the government and suppressing the information that Bobby Kennedy's organization was trying to get out there.
[02:57:36.611 --> 02:57:39.572]  And all he does is distribute information that's publicly available.
[02:57:39.572 --> 02:57:41.913]  And by the way, did you see Mercola's letter?
[02:57:41.913 --> 02:57:48.456]  Where he shows that he and 11 others, including Robert Kennedy Jr., were listed basically as terrorists by Bill Gates Foundation subgroup.
[02:57:48.456 --> 02:57:52.798]  And they said you cyber command the Pentagon and the Army physically against them.
[02:57:52.798 --> 02:58:02.362]  So Big Pharma's so desperate now, not up to kill the old folks in the old folks' homes, now they're literally talking about using counter-terrorism forces against Robert Kennedy Jr.
[02:58:03.969 --> 02:58:05.391]  Exactly, and this is Bobby Kennedy Jr.
[02:58:05.391 --> 02:58:06.752]  I mean, he's not some right-winger.
[02:58:06.752 --> 02:58:11.337]  I mean, he comes from those prominent liberal democratic family in the history of the country.
[02:58:11.337 --> 02:58:20.628]  But he's just willing to raise questions about, he believes in informed consent, and he's willing to raise questions about the medical establishment because he's seen them lie over time.
[02:58:20.628 --> 02:58:23.571]  And he's been, well, willing to raise questions about... Whatever happened to my body, my choice?
[02:58:24.964 --> 02:58:25.364]  Exactly.
[02:58:25.364 --> 02:58:28.127]  And that's his core view across the board.
[02:58:28.127 --> 02:58:33.351]  And he is willing to distrust the white lab coat crowd and distrust the intelligence apparatus.
[02:58:33.351 --> 02:58:42.058]  And he has been highly critical, especially of Bill Gates, talking about Bill Gates and overlapping involvement in big tech, big ag and big pharma.
[02:58:42.058 --> 02:58:46.282]  And that's a scary combination to have one billionaire, one oligarch
[02:58:47.143 --> 02:59:01.215]  Disproportionate influence in those three economic areas, then you combine it with the way he has co-opted and bought off almost every public health authority in the world, not just the World Health Organization, but almost every other public health authority.
[02:59:01.215 --> 02:59:08.321]  And the only few he's been outed from is the countries he's been exposed in, like in India and like in parts of Africa.
[02:59:08.321 --> 02:59:12.745]  And it's only a matter of time before the country comes to the awakening of who Bill Gates is.
[02:59:12.745 --> 02:59:13.406]  But what's great
[02:59:14.086 --> 02:59:21.715]  We are at record levels of public recognition of the risks of vaccines and big pharma and state coercion.
[02:59:21.715 --> 02:59:29.163]  We're at record levels of the American people knowing about the Nuremberg Code and the informed consent rights and the limits of emergency use authorization.
[02:59:29.563 --> 02:59:33.647]  So the world is changing, thanks in large part to programs like InfoWars.
[02:59:33.647 --> 02:59:42.576]  And the InfoWars audience continuing to not only support InfoWars by going to InfoWarsStore.com, but also by getting the messages and sharing the links and sharing the content.
[02:59:42.576 --> 02:59:42.936]  Well, that's right.
[02:59:42.936 --> 02:59:45.739]  I mean, Kennedy's speaking to crowds of a million plus people.
[02:59:45.739 --> 02:59:46.259]  Panic him.
[02:59:46.259 --> 02:59:47.481]  We'll be right back in 60 seconds.
[02:59:49.694 --> 02:59:52.198]  Alex Jones here with some really good news.

[03:00:27.338 --> 03:00:28.099]  Plus, they're great products.

[03:01:02.130 --> 03:01:06.593]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[03:01:06.593 --> 03:01:08.054]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:01:08.054 --> 03:01:13.537]  All right, we got doctors, we got nurses, we got paramedics, we got them lined up massively.
[03:01:13.537 --> 03:01:15.298]  And I'm going to get to everybody on the board.
[03:01:15.298 --> 03:01:21.482]  Danny, Brian, Russell, Mike, Katie, Brian, Jenny, James, and Lynn.
[03:01:21.482 --> 03:01:24.403]  You may all just get a minute or half or so, but I'll get to every one of you, and I appreciate you holding.
[03:01:24.403 --> 03:01:30.267]  I also need to hit, Andy was setting up checkpoints, attacking people around the country and in Europe, and what's behind that.
[03:01:30.267 --> 03:01:31.328]  I'll do that in the last segment.
[03:01:32.964 --> 03:01:36.967]  Before you get out of here, spend a few minutes on other issues.
[03:01:36.967 --> 03:01:38.368]  Good news, people are waking up.
[03:01:38.368 --> 03:01:40.589]  They thought they'd have 90% vaccine by now.
[03:01:40.589 --> 03:01:42.250]  They're closing their vaccine centers around the world.
[03:01:42.250 --> 03:01:42.971]  People aren't buying it.
[03:01:43.965 --> 03:01:48.589]  You're leading the charge on that, Robert Kennedy Jr., we are, but the general public really is the tip of the spear.
[03:01:48.589 --> 03:01:56.796]  If they just educate folks and share your interviews and my interviews and Robert Kennedy's and Dale Bigtree and all that, it's going to be game over.
[03:01:56.796 --> 03:02:06.245]  And if the listeners, all these great nurses and doctors and medical workers, call and talk radio and say, this is who I am, or go knock on the local station and say, here, I'm a local doctor and I want to speak.
[03:02:07.173 --> 03:02:09.594]  Without being scared of the local clinic firing you.
[03:02:09.594 --> 03:02:10.654]  They can't fire us all.
[03:02:10.654 --> 03:02:11.975]  I mean, this is a war.
[03:02:11.975 --> 03:02:15.756]  But at least anonymously call in or anonymously write letters to the editor.
[03:02:15.756 --> 03:02:22.019]  The point is, every person you touch, even if it's the person that works at the newspaper, if they don't even publish it, they still see that.
[03:02:23.084 --> 03:02:24.966]  And so don't let them think that you're powerless.
[03:02:24.966 --> 03:02:33.657]  But what about trying to trigger the riots, trying to make the financial collapse because of inflation they triggered look like it's a racial issue this summer?
[03:02:33.657 --> 03:02:41.926]  Clearly, they want to hide the economic crisis they've created, the consolidation, the lockdown, knowing this would cause inflation, knowing it would cause scarcity.
[03:02:41.926 --> 03:02:42.988]  They want to hide that.
[03:02:43.909 --> 03:02:58.303]  Behind racial injustice and use that, use the collapse in the economy to even bring globalists into more power with a universal basic income, which gives them total control and surveillance and medical tyranny and forced inoculation for your payment.
[03:02:58.303 --> 03:02:59.525]  That's the Holy Grail.
[03:02:59.525 --> 03:03:01.547]  We're only a few months away from that.
[03:03:01.547 --> 03:03:05.691]  And then you've got the Feds indicting Chauvin and others today.
[03:03:05.691 --> 03:03:06.632]  Talk about that for us.
[03:03:07.719 --> 03:03:08.339]  Sure.
[03:03:08.339 --> 03:03:14.941]  So, I mean, on the Chauvin trial, what we're seeing is the continued political weaponization of the entire prosecutorial and police process.
[03:03:14.941 --> 03:03:22.602]  So we're seeing that they want to convert America's police into their own secret Stasi, their own style KGB operation.
[03:03:22.602 --> 03:03:28.224]  They want a politicized, weaponized police and prosecutorial process in America.
[03:03:28.224 --> 03:03:29.444]  That's why you're starting them.
[03:03:29.444 --> 03:03:34.265]  They're using the guise of the Derek Chauvin case to now take over the Minneapolis Police Department.
[03:03:34.645 --> 03:03:39.087]  They're using the guise of the Breonna Taylor case to take over the Louisville Police Department.
[03:03:39.087 --> 03:03:47.910]  They did this before when they went after the Baltimore Police Department and the Chicago Police Department under Obama in 2014-2015.
[03:03:47.910 --> 03:03:51.012]  People can go back and look at how that turned out.
[03:03:51.012 --> 03:03:59.035]  Crime skyrocketed, problems rose, corruption expanded, and civil rights did not improve meaningfully.
[03:03:59.837 --> 03:04:02.039]  So that's part one of what's going on with Chauvin.
[03:04:02.039 --> 03:04:19.254]  The second part of what's going on with Chauvin is it turns out, of course, a juror lied to get onto the Chauvin jury, basically was a BLM activist who was a part of podcasts broadcasting his activism, went to public protests with Floyd family members broadcasting his activism.
[03:04:19.714 --> 03:04:26.079]  Basically went on afterwards and told people, it was encouraging people to plant themselves onto trials, onto jury trials.
[03:04:26.079 --> 03:04:29.501]  This was like a Klan style tactic from the 1950s.
[03:04:29.501 --> 03:04:35.425]  To hide your Klan identity, to sneak onto a trial, to make sure civil rights wouldn't occur in a lot of high profile murder cases.
[03:04:35.425 --> 03:04:36.226]  And is that surprising?
[03:04:36.226 --> 03:04:40.329]  The Democrats literally, the modern incantation, not the Thomas Jefferson,
[03:04:41.129 --> 03:04:46.253]  Uh, Democrats, but the one since, you know, 1866 or so has been the Klan.
[03:04:46.253 --> 03:04:57.920]  The Klan was the governing council of the Democrats, so we wonder why all their tactics are Klan, just now they're having blacks and minorities do it, run by actual Klan members who are always racially based and just wanted power.
[03:04:57.920 --> 03:05:01.683]  We're literally, literally facing the Democratic Party with KKK tactics.
[03:05:02.745 --> 03:05:03.285]  Exactly.
[03:05:03.285 --> 03:05:05.766]  The Klan was wildly effective.
[03:05:05.766 --> 03:05:08.167]  I mean, the Klan managed to weaponize the mob.
[03:05:08.167 --> 03:05:13.189]  The Klan managed to make basically legal justice turned into mob justice.
[03:05:13.189 --> 03:05:16.911]  The Klan was able to intimidate voters and coerce certain voting patterns.
[03:05:16.911 --> 03:05:24.394]  They're just taking the things they learned from the Democratic Party's long alignment with and largely creation of the Klan.
[03:05:24.394 --> 03:05:27.715]  You dig in deep, you find out the Klan was not an organic, authentic group.
[03:05:28.035 --> 03:05:33.278]  The Klan would rise and fall depending on what the politicians in power supported them or not.
[03:05:33.278 --> 03:05:38.700]  They were weaponized tools of the establishment infrastructure local to the community.
[03:05:38.700 --> 03:05:41.081]  They were not some organic group.
[03:05:41.081 --> 03:05:44.463]  That's why, you know, people said the Klan made up of poor white people.
[03:05:44.463 --> 03:05:45.143]  Totally false.
[03:05:45.143 --> 03:05:48.405]  If it was poor white people, there would have been some rich white people hanging from trees.
[03:05:48.405 --> 03:05:48.825]  There weren't.
[03:05:50.726 --> 03:06:03.952]  Outer clan that is the, you know, the idiots that they send out to do things, but this was the rich planners controlling the poor white people with a gang they were supposedly had to support that was going to protect them from the blacks.
[03:06:05.291 --> 03:06:07.192]  Oh, completely!
[03:06:07.192 --> 03:06:09.514]  Indeed, Klan actually targeted labor activists.
[03:06:09.514 --> 03:06:12.796]  Klan targeted white sharecroppers and white tenant farmers.
[03:06:12.796 --> 03:06:13.857]  People go back to look.
[03:06:13.857 --> 03:06:20.762]  The majority of poor whites could not vote in most deep South states from 1896 until 1968 for almost a century.
[03:06:20.762 --> 03:06:22.764]  It wasn't just exclusion of black voters.
[03:06:22.764 --> 03:06:26.146]  There's a reason why Mississippi had fewer voters in 1900 than 1860.
[03:06:26.146 --> 03:06:29.568]  And that wasn't because there was a bunch of slaves voting in 1860.
[03:06:30.589 --> 03:06:33.711]  It was because a lot of poor, almost poor whites were systematically removed.
[03:06:33.711 --> 03:06:37.853]  You know, Matt McConaughey, a local Austinite, portrayed that character in the Free State of Jones.
[03:06:37.853 --> 03:06:41.654]  There was a lot of that kind of working class coalition making.
[03:06:41.654 --> 03:06:44.676]  And in order to break that up, that was also where the Klan was useful.
[03:06:44.676 --> 03:06:52.460]  And the Klan is also a political permission slip for sociopaths and psychopaths to act out their criminal pathology.
[03:06:52.460 --> 03:06:55.941]  That's why these guys always have domestic violence records and criminal records.
[03:06:55.941 --> 03:06:59.063]  And if you look at it, just take the same thing and just shift it.
[03:06:59.363 --> 03:07:00.283]  Put a new name on it.
[03:07:00.283 --> 03:07:02.264]  Instead of Klan, call it Antifa.
[03:07:02.264 --> 03:07:04.265]  Instead of Klan, call it BLM.
[03:07:04.265 --> 03:07:10.567]  Instead of Klan, call it parts of the Black Panthers and militia movements from the 1960s, 1970s on the left.
[03:07:10.567 --> 03:07:12.227]  Weather Underground, other components.
[03:07:12.227 --> 03:07:13.268]  That's all they're doing.
[03:07:13.268 --> 03:07:20.190]  But the Klan is the most relevant template because it's almost precisely what Antifa's doing and partially what BLM is doing.
[03:07:20.190 --> 03:07:22.371]  And they just had their great success in the Chauvin trial.
[03:07:22.671 --> 03:07:23.091]  Exactly.
[03:07:23.091 --> 03:07:29.856]  It's a hidden group, mainly political, manipulating groups against each other, and then it's got a paramilitary arm that goes out and terrorizes people.
[03:07:29.856 --> 03:07:31.117]  That's Antifa.
[03:07:31.117 --> 03:07:42.464]  And Antifa's main funder is a former Nazi collaborator who actually works with Nazis to overthrow the Hungary leader, who he's trying now, and the leader in Ukraine.
[03:07:42.464 --> 03:07:48.968]  I mean, he literally funds Nazis to overthrow governments, but because he's Jewish, he's allowed to do it.
[03:07:48.968 --> 03:07:49.829]  It's totally sick.
[03:07:50.976 --> 03:08:01.278]  Completely, and if people want to look at Antifa, if Antifa was legitimately an anarchistic group, a group that was opposed to capitalism, why have they never attacked the Federal Reserve?
[03:08:01.278 --> 03:08:04.839]  Why do they never attack Wall Street banks?
[03:08:04.839 --> 03:08:12.841]  Why do you think the mayor suddenly says, we're going to unmask them, we're going to arrest them, we're going to convict them, why is he finally standing up to Antifa in Portland?
[03:08:14.910 --> 03:08:19.492]  I think all of that is to let the local community know that he's really in control.
[03:08:19.492 --> 03:08:23.153]  Don't be afraid of Antifa, because they're really an extension of us.
[03:08:23.153 --> 03:08:25.094]  They're an extension of our political machine.
[03:08:25.094 --> 03:08:29.536]  Sure, so they turn them loose, and then the government's the savior of their own army.
[03:08:29.536 --> 03:08:30.096]  Exactly.
[03:08:30.096 --> 03:08:35.278]  It's like a pied piper brings the rats, then he plays the flute, takes the rats away, you sell out your children to him.
[03:08:36.303 --> 03:08:36.843]  Precisely.
[03:08:36.843 --> 03:08:38.124]  It's exactly the way the Klan worked.
[03:08:38.124 --> 03:08:39.784]  It's exactly the way the Klan functioned.
[03:08:39.784 --> 03:08:43.425]  Remember, repeatedly, there'd be different times where they would crack down on the Klan.
[03:08:43.425 --> 03:08:50.167]  The reality is, whenever they wanted to unleash a privatized mob violence, they would let the Klan get big and grow strong.
[03:08:50.167 --> 03:08:52.308]  Whenever they decided they didn't want that, they'd pull them back.
[03:08:52.308 --> 03:08:54.009]  Then they'd unleash them, then pull them back.
[03:08:54.009 --> 03:08:56.209]  They're just using Antifa in the exact same way.
[03:08:56.209 --> 03:08:58.870]  It shows you how controlled Antifa really is.
[03:08:58.870 --> 03:09:01.111]  These so-called anarchistic radicals.
[03:09:01.451 --> 03:09:05.558]  Then nobody would confuse them with the Molly Maguires from the late 19th century.
[03:09:05.558 --> 03:09:10.225]  These aren't really... And you know about the Klan because some of your earliest stuff as a lawyer has been fighting them.
[03:09:10.225 --> 03:09:12.068]  It's fascinating history.
[03:09:12.068 --> 03:09:14.973]  We also have the FBI's long history of working with the Klan as well.
[03:09:16.258 --> 03:09:20.180]  And, does anybody doubt that there aren't major FBI informants as part of all this?
[03:09:20.180 --> 03:09:21.080]  Encouraging it?
[03:09:21.080 --> 03:09:31.404]  I mean, we now know about January 6th, that there were FBI informants all over the place, in key positions, trying to- Hosing as- saying they were Q, manipulating people in there.
[03:09:32.390 --> 03:09:33.030]  Exactly.
[03:09:33.030 --> 03:09:35.211]  One after the other, after the other, after the other.
[03:09:35.211 --> 03:09:49.855]  Key members of Proud Boys, key members of Oath Keep, all these people that supposedly were independent groups, the ones that were actually active doing crazy stuff that day, it turns out disproportionately were either connected to or were themselves government informants.
[03:09:49.855 --> 03:09:54.837]  I mean, the so-called head of the Proud Boys turned out to have a multi-year relationship with them.
[03:09:54.837 --> 03:09:56.957]  People could go back and watch the church committee.
[03:09:56.957 --> 03:10:00.378]  There was a bunch of key Klansmen that were FBI informants.
[03:10:00.378 --> 03:10:01.919]  Some of them were actually FBI agents.
[03:10:02.299 --> 03:10:05.041]  Does anybody doubt the same thing is happening with Antifa?
[03:10:05.041 --> 03:10:07.802]  And why is it the FBI has never figured out who Q is?
[03:10:07.802 --> 03:10:11.164]  Maybe because Q is really part of the FBI at some level?
[03:10:11.164 --> 03:10:12.585]  So, I think... Well, that's right.
[03:10:12.585 --> 03:10:14.206]  You called it before it all happened.
[03:10:14.206 --> 03:10:15.687]  It almost set me and the President up.
[03:10:15.687 --> 03:10:17.147]  We barely got out of it.
[03:10:17.147 --> 03:10:18.548]  What a fiasco.
[03:10:18.548 --> 03:10:19.849]  Hey, pick a time right now.
[03:10:19.849 --> 03:10:21.330]  You're coming back next week for an hour, please.
[03:10:21.330 --> 03:10:22.951]  This is fascinating.
[03:10:22.951 --> 03:10:23.751]  We got 20 seconds.
[03:10:23.751 --> 03:10:25.132]  Tell people about the show you're hosting.
[03:10:25.132 --> 03:10:26.913]  Folks, put his lower third up, please.
[03:10:27.938 --> 03:10:28.459]  Sure.
[03:10:28.459 --> 03:10:33.745]  Yeah, so if people want more information, they can go to viva-barnes-law-dot-locals-dot-com.
[03:10:33.745 --> 03:10:38.811]  That's where we put up a bunch of hush-hush episodes and other things about alternative theories about the way the world operates.
[03:10:38.811 --> 03:10:40.953]  And I'll be on next Tuesday.
[03:10:40.953 --> 03:10:42.775]  All right, next Tuesday, you're coming on with us.
[03:10:42.775 --> 03:10:44.157]  We'll be back with your calls, troopers.
[03:10:44.157 --> 03:10:44.617]  Stay with us.
[03:10:44.617 --> 03:10:46.359]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[03:10:48.613 --> 03:10:51.996]  I am a very humble person, but I'm also a bold person.
[03:10:51.996 --> 03:11:01.924]  And so, as bad as things are with the globalist attack on humanity, with all the terrible things that are unfolding, I want you to know that a lot of positive things are happening as well.
[03:11:01.924 --> 03:11:05.287]  I'm a public figure, so I get to see things the general public doesn't get to see.
[03:11:05.287 --> 03:11:16.856]  And let me tell you, whether it's police chiefs, or members of Congress, or even folks in Hollywood, or mainstream media, or industry, people are really, really away from the establishment.
[03:11:17.716 --> 03:11:22.358]  They don't want to go along with the globalists, but they're scared, they're looking for leadership.
[03:11:22.358 --> 03:11:24.439]  Well, that's where InfoWars comes in.
[03:11:24.439 --> 03:11:28.780]  You fund us, you support InfoWars4.com, you get great products to you at the same time.
[03:11:28.780 --> 03:11:38.403]  We will then go out and do what the globalists say is unpopular, what the globalists will target you for, to show people that it's safe to tell the truth and to take the heat.
[03:11:38.403 --> 03:11:39.324]  That's our job.
[03:11:39.324 --> 03:11:45.786]  So please, keep us on air so we can hit the barbed wire, so we can be the shock groups in the information war.
[03:11:46.307 --> 03:11:47.699]  Find us at InfoWarsTore.com
[03:11:48.624 --> 03:11:50.526]  Again, I don't like to lecture people.
[03:11:50.526 --> 03:12:01.615]  I'm a very private person, but because of the globalists and their attack on humanity, I've been forced the last 27 years to be a public figure, and we've given the globalists one hell of a run for their money because of God.
[03:12:01.615 --> 03:12:05.578]  And I know some of our listeners get mad when I talk about God all day, but just give me a break.
[03:12:05.578 --> 03:12:06.959]  The Satanism's out in the open.
[03:12:06.959 --> 03:12:12.083]  I've always been a Christian, but now the fact that it's a fight between good and evil is so clear.
[03:12:12.083 --> 03:12:12.484]  And I get it.
[03:12:12.484 --> 03:12:14.265]  A lot of you have been turned off by big churches.
[03:12:14.265 --> 03:12:16.407]  A lot of you have been turned off by the corrupt.
[03:12:17.319 --> 03:12:18.320]  We're good to go.
[03:12:32.752 --> 03:12:34.614]  And so that's what InfoWars is really all about.
[03:12:34.614 --> 03:12:36.615]  So thank you all for your word of mouth.
[03:12:36.615 --> 03:12:38.217]  Thank you for spreading the word about InfoWars.
[03:12:38.217 --> 03:12:42.140]  And thank you for supporting us to keep us on air by visiting InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:12:42.140 --> 03:12:46.103]  Because without your daily and weekly and monthly purchases, we'll be taken off the air.
[03:12:46.103 --> 03:12:47.064]  So thank you for the support.
[03:12:47.064 --> 03:12:51.628]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:12:51.628 --> 03:12:54.250]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:13:04.256 --> 03:13:08.141]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here, back live broadcasting worldwide.
[03:13:08.141 --> 03:13:10.264]  It's 2.20 central.
[03:13:10.264 --> 03:13:12.867]  I'll be back this Sunday, Lord willing, 4 to 8 p.m.
[03:13:12.867 --> 03:13:17.573]  I'm going to do an extra two hours live, and we're going to take your calls then.
[03:13:18.542 --> 03:13:29.906]  And the great part about Sunday Live is we only do the local ads, so it's only like six minutes of ads an hour, so we'll have a lot of time to take your calls from people who have a view on the vaccine or have a report about the vaccine.
[03:13:29.906 --> 03:13:30.726]  People love the vaccine.
[03:13:30.726 --> 03:13:31.547]  You're welcome to call in.
[03:13:31.547 --> 03:13:35.308]  No one has done that yet, telling me how wonderful it is or how great it is.
[03:13:35.308 --> 03:13:37.289]  All we've seen is death and destruction.
[03:13:37.289 --> 03:13:38.489]  We're taking your phone calls right now.
[03:13:38.489 --> 03:13:39.950]  I appreciate everybody holding so long.
[03:13:39.950 --> 03:13:42.511]  I'm going to take the calls, the order they are received.
[03:13:42.511 --> 03:13:43.631]  I'm going to move quickly.
[03:13:43.631 --> 03:13:45.692]  Brian in Georgia, you're on the air.
[03:13:45.692 --> 03:13:46.012]  Welcome.
[03:13:48.570 --> 03:13:55.514]  I want to say Body Ease got my wife off of Ibuprofen 800 for two years now, so thank you for that product.
[03:13:55.514 --> 03:13:55.954]  Thank you.
[03:13:55.954 --> 03:14:01.977]  And I also have a bone to pick with you about Super Blue down to my last tube.
[03:14:01.977 --> 03:14:07.360]  I need you to rebrand, maybe bring it back in with Dr. Jones Naturals.
[03:14:07.360 --> 03:14:07.940]  We need it back.
[03:14:10.376 --> 03:14:12.498]  Well, let me tell you what happened with that.
[03:14:12.498 --> 03:14:18.444]  You saw hundreds of articles in the national news saying Alex Jones says he has a cure for coronavirus.
[03:14:18.444 --> 03:14:19.264]  I've never said that.
[03:14:19.264 --> 03:14:21.887]  It had nothing to do with coronavirus.
[03:14:21.887 --> 03:14:24.209]  The product had been out for like seven years.
[03:14:24.209 --> 03:14:33.338]  But because it had natural silver in it, they were saying I had committed this crime and they wanted me arrested.
[03:14:34.005 --> 03:14:37.829]  And they had gone and were trying to get them to do this.
[03:14:37.829 --> 03:14:40.531]  And then they kept saying he won't stop selling it.
[03:14:40.531 --> 03:14:42.853]  He won't stop saying it's secure.
[03:14:42.853 --> 03:14:50.880]  And so basically we stopped selling it just because they wouldn't stop saying it.
[03:14:50.880 --> 03:14:53.603]  And Leticia James, the same way that sent everybody into the
[03:14:54.395 --> 03:14:55.095]  No, I don't think so.
[03:15:14.130 --> 03:15:19.717]  Uh, and then saying that you're doing it, and then they create that perception, like, he's the white supremacist, kill him!
[03:15:19.717 --> 03:15:25.384]  You know, like, kill Tucker Carlson, you know, and he's not a white supremacist, even if he was, he doesn't deserve to die.
[03:15:25.384 --> 03:15:29.049]  So that's the type of terrorism goes on with these guys.
[03:15:30.919 --> 03:15:37.005]  I will tell you that an even best seller was the tooth whitening with the, and it's the same thing.
[03:15:37.005 --> 03:15:38.447]  I'm running out of mine.
[03:15:38.447 --> 03:15:39.888]  No more was produced.
[03:15:39.888 --> 03:15:40.930]  My wife's like, where is it?
[03:15:40.930 --> 03:15:41.490]  I want more.
[03:15:41.490 --> 03:15:44.493]  And it's a big bummer.
[03:15:44.493 --> 03:15:46.475]  And, you know, that's just the way it is.
[03:15:47.774 --> 03:15:51.297]  You know, somebody else should just come out and do it themselves and, you know, good for them.
[03:15:51.297 --> 03:15:52.818]  Because you got to pick your battles.
[03:15:52.818 --> 03:15:55.039]  And they were framing me.
[03:15:55.039 --> 03:15:59.783]  And so that's why sometimes you just got to turn loose, you know, at that point.
[03:15:59.783 --> 03:16:00.744]  But I hear you.
[03:16:00.744 --> 03:16:07.528]  Hey, our activated charcoal is super concentrated, super strong toothpaste.
[03:16:07.528 --> 03:16:08.049]  Folks love it.
[03:16:08.049 --> 03:16:09.870]  But let me tell you a little secret.
[03:16:09.870 --> 03:16:12.052]  We do have another toothpaste coming out very, very soon.
[03:16:12.052 --> 03:16:12.832]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[03:16:12.832 --> 03:16:14.434]  So I got to get to all the callers.
[03:16:14.434 --> 03:16:14.934]  Brian, go ahead.
[03:16:16.033 --> 03:16:16.413]  Yes, sir.
[03:16:16.413 --> 03:16:18.936]  So the reason we call it is the vaccines.
[03:16:18.936 --> 03:16:26.824]  Unfortunately, my wife's mother got the first shot of the Moderna and had a period issue, went into the hospital.
[03:16:26.824 --> 03:16:31.328]  They thought they seen some kind of cancerous thing.
[03:16:31.328 --> 03:16:37.474]  Anyway, it's all the way escalated now to where she's had a full hysterectomy and they're trying to get her on chemo.
[03:16:38.549 --> 03:16:52.921]  And by the way, sir, I'm not laughing at what happened to your mother, but how obvious, her mother, how obvious they say, oh, you get a bunch of bleeding and even old ladies have their periods come back and it grows a bunch of tumors in your breast and uterus, but don't worry, ignore those.
[03:16:52.921 --> 03:16:55.143]  Then the doctors check it and it's real cancer.
[03:16:55.143 --> 03:16:57.405]  So again, they're giving people cancer.
[03:16:57.405 --> 03:16:59.547]  Is that not insane?
[03:16:59.547 --> 03:17:01.288]  They didn't even consider it.
[03:17:01.288 --> 03:17:05.191]  I mean, they just went straight into, let's go to surgery.
[03:17:05.191 --> 03:17:06.853]  Now they're trying to get her into chemo.
[03:17:07.395 --> 03:17:10.757]  In case they missed something.
[03:17:10.757 --> 03:17:11.798]  It's out of control.
[03:17:11.798 --> 03:17:12.678]  You see how it works?
[03:17:12.678 --> 03:17:14.379]  They give you tumors.
[03:17:14.379 --> 03:17:21.444]  Even the God AP, the God Reuters, the God of the New York Times admit these tumors.
[03:17:21.444 --> 03:17:22.945]  So let me ask this question.
[03:17:22.945 --> 03:17:26.527]  Is she listening to you now?
[03:17:26.527 --> 03:17:31.330]  Unfortunately, you know, they're good country folks that
[03:17:33.078 --> 03:17:36.122]  You know, I've always been the crazy one.
[03:17:36.122 --> 03:17:38.906]  You know, I've listened to you since 2001.
[03:17:38.906 --> 03:17:40.549]  So let me ask you, ask her this.
[03:17:40.549 --> 03:17:45.796]  If she was out in Arizona and a rattlesnake bit her and her legs swole up, would she say the rattlesnake did it?
[03:17:45.796 --> 03:17:48.841]  Or would she go, I'm a good Christian lady, I like that diamond back?
[03:17:49.381 --> 03:17:51.923]  I mean, again, no, I've got family the same damn way.
[03:17:51.923 --> 03:17:57.507]  My grandmother said my doctor told me that they gave me polio and he was sorry and the vaccine and I forgave him.
[03:17:57.507 --> 03:17:59.688]  So you stop talking about that on air.
[03:17:59.688 --> 03:18:01.229]  We'll do what we're told.
[03:18:01.229 --> 03:18:02.570]  I mean, it's disgusting.
[03:18:02.570 --> 03:18:05.372]  I love my grandmother, damn it.
[03:18:05.372 --> 03:18:06.353]  God!
[03:18:06.353 --> 03:18:09.375]  Excuse me, go ahead.
[03:18:09.375 --> 03:18:17.280]  Right now, she's not planning on getting the second dose and my wife is trying to keep her out of, you know, going through chemo.
[03:18:17.996 --> 03:18:22.218]  And she doesn't seem like she's very into that as an option either.
[03:18:22.218 --> 03:18:27.420]  So hopefully, you know, she recovers from this.
[03:18:27.420 --> 03:18:28.420]  I agree, brother.
[03:18:28.420 --> 03:18:31.782]  You should sue the living snot out of the people that did it.
[03:18:31.782 --> 03:18:33.342]  I don't care if they claim vaccine protection.
[03:18:33.342 --> 03:18:37.664]  It's not a vaccine, Nuremberg trial, because you can bring the literature to your mother-in-law and show her.
[03:18:38.672 --> 03:18:45.294]  Where they admitted, oh don't worry, you get a bunch of tumors in your uterus and your breast, and men get them on their testicles, those aren't bad tumors.
[03:18:45.294 --> 03:18:47.614]  But then the doctors go check them and they're damn cancer!
[03:18:47.614 --> 03:18:49.275]  They gave her cancer!
[03:18:49.275 --> 03:18:51.535]  They activated that!
[03:18:51.535 --> 03:18:52.176]  Gosh!
[03:18:52.176 --> 03:18:54.596]  Can you believe that, evil brother?
[03:18:54.596 --> 03:19:00.058]  The inserts are blank, so we can't even use that in court.
[03:19:00.058 --> 03:19:01.478]  God bless you, I appreciate your call.
[03:19:01.478 --> 03:19:03.739]  Yeah, the level of evil is just unbelievable.
[03:19:03.739 --> 03:19:06.440]  It's just so diabolical.
[03:19:06.440 --> 03:19:08.020]  Brian, in New York, go ahead.
[03:19:09.366 --> 03:19:09.886]  Hey, Alex.
[03:19:09.886 --> 03:19:12.167]  First, I just want to say thanks for taking my call.
[03:19:12.167 --> 03:19:12.948]  I appreciate it.
[03:19:12.948 --> 03:19:13.928]  I appreciate the work that you do.
[03:19:13.928 --> 03:19:18.490]  You know, to scare you, Alex, that's why they want to kick you off the airwaves, but we'll keep fighting a good fight.
[03:19:18.490 --> 03:19:19.190]  God bless you.
[03:19:19.190 --> 03:19:20.451]  Thanks.
[03:19:20.451 --> 03:19:21.171]  Well, thank you, brother.
[03:19:21.171 --> 03:19:22.732]  What's your point?
[03:19:22.732 --> 03:19:24.152]  Go ahead.
[03:19:24.152 --> 03:19:32.376]  So, you know, I've taken many medications, vaccines, you know, in my life, but I've never seen one with a propaganda campaign behind it.
[03:19:32.376 --> 03:19:34.437]  And it's kind of scary.
[03:19:34.437 --> 03:19:36.898]  I think we're being lied to by everyone in charge.
[03:19:36.898 --> 03:19:38.899]  And if you even question anything, you know, I'm sure
[03:19:39.457 --> 03:19:42.579]  I know you saw what Joe Robich said the other day on his show.
[03:19:42.579 --> 03:19:45.420]  Totally fair-minded, reasonable take on the vaccine.
[03:19:45.420 --> 03:19:46.440]  He was thrown through the mud.
[03:19:46.440 --> 03:19:51.563]  You know, if you dissent at all from the media and from the machine, you're going to be censured, you're going to be punished.
[03:19:51.563 --> 03:19:55.865]  And my question to you, Alex, is how did it get this way, and what do we do in the next few years?
[03:19:55.865 --> 03:20:03.168]  I mean, if people say... Well, brother, I mean, it's like termites get in an old barn or an old house, and the place still looks okay until the wind comes by and blows it over.
[03:20:04.884 --> 03:20:07.225]  Evil just grows to a point and the bottom falls out.
[03:20:07.225 --> 03:20:13.267]  The bottom's falling out because the general public is in a trained trance.
[03:20:13.267 --> 03:20:21.249]  And so they're so selfish and so normalized that their life, if you were asleep, you wouldn't care if a spider was biting you.
[03:20:21.249 --> 03:20:22.709]  Well, they're asleep.
[03:20:22.709 --> 03:20:25.010]  And everybody's very childlike and very silly.
[03:20:25.010 --> 03:20:26.631]  People aren't serious.
[03:20:26.631 --> 03:20:27.991]  They don't want to have a responsibility.
[03:20:28.926 --> 03:20:31.487]  Uh, and so, and so that's what happens.
[03:20:31.487 --> 03:20:36.110]  And, and, and so you got to get them out of the trance and just get in their face, brother.
[03:20:36.110 --> 03:20:41.452]  You know, the, the, the, the mindset is, you know, the government will give us our rights back when the pandemic is over.
[03:20:41.452 --> 03:20:42.653]  And it's just not the case.
[03:20:42.653 --> 03:20:44.033]  It ends when we, when we decided that.
[03:20:44.033 --> 03:20:45.614]  Well, that's right.
[03:20:45.614 --> 03:20:46.995]  Government never gave us our rights.
[03:20:46.995 --> 03:20:50.196]  We demanded it and had a constitution bill of rights to enshrine it.
[03:20:50.196 --> 03:20:50.396]  Right.
[03:20:50.396 --> 03:20:51.857]  God gave it.
[03:20:51.857 --> 03:20:53.298]  Exactly.
[03:20:53.298 --> 03:20:53.978]  Brian, anything else?
[03:20:55.111 --> 03:20:57.612]  No, Alex, I just want to say thank you again for everything that you do.
[03:20:57.612 --> 03:20:58.633]  Thank you, man.
[03:20:58.633 --> 03:20:59.233]  We're in it together.
[03:20:59.233 --> 03:21:00.233]  Alright, start your engines.
[03:21:00.233 --> 03:21:03.935]  When I come back, we've got one, two, three, four, five, six calls.
[03:21:03.935 --> 03:21:06.996]  I will take every one of them in the next segment because I've got one last segment.
[03:21:06.996 --> 03:21:13.339]  I've got to hit the Antiva videos because I've got the crew to get me a whole bunch of videos of insanity.
[03:21:13.339 --> 03:21:18.541]  From Spain to the U.S., they've got people at gunpoint.
[03:21:18.541 --> 03:21:23.523]  They're just setting up checkpoints like police screaming and yelling at everybody and just taking over and the police do nothing.
[03:21:24.725 --> 03:21:28.227]  I mean, my God, I pulled the checkpoint with Antifa running the point guns at me?
[03:21:28.227 --> 03:21:28.908]  That's a deadly weapon.
[03:21:28.908 --> 03:21:30.769]  I'm going to defend myself.
[03:21:30.769 --> 03:21:36.112]  It's better to be tried by nine than carried by six, and I have no desire to kill Antifa.
[03:21:36.112 --> 03:21:39.234]  They are sacks of meth-head, devil-worshipper garbage.
[03:21:39.234 --> 03:21:42.856]  But I'll tell you this, I'm going to defend myself from you sacks of trash.
[03:21:42.856 --> 03:21:43.516]  We'll be right back.
[03:21:43.516 --> 03:21:48.179]  Stay with us, InfoWars.com.
[03:21:48.179 --> 03:21:52.502]  You know, listeners call into the show and they thank me, and it makes me feel pathetic.
[03:21:53.274 --> 03:21:56.635]  Because I sit there and I beg you for support constantly.
[03:21:56.635 --> 03:22:00.556]  For prayer, for financial support, and for word of mouth.
[03:22:00.556 --> 03:22:02.017]  And we're all in this together.
[03:22:02.017 --> 03:22:07.379]  And it gets old having to come to you and say, hey, I got great products, please buy them or we won't be here on air.
[03:22:07.379 --> 03:22:08.079]  But it's true.
[03:22:08.079 --> 03:22:11.460]  We're the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this level.
[03:22:12.220 --> 03:22:14.704]  That is not beholden to the big corporate sponsors.
[03:22:14.704 --> 03:22:16.766]  And they've harassed and almost shut down everybody else.
[03:22:16.766 --> 03:22:18.549]  They've crippled all the other groups.
[03:22:18.549 --> 03:22:19.410]  And we're still here.
[03:22:19.410 --> 03:22:23.835]  And as this whole New World Order comes out in the open, our credibility is showing up.
[03:22:23.835 --> 03:22:25.457]  That's why we've got to be taken off air.
[03:22:25.457 --> 03:22:27.500]  That's why America has got to be taken down.
[03:22:27.580 --> 03:22:32.005]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved, and America's still quasi-free.
[03:22:32.005 --> 03:22:37.130]  You can't have InfoWars, which has been proven right, being on air, with all the craziness that's about to unfold.
[03:22:37.130 --> 03:22:39.192]  Because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready.
[03:22:39.192 --> 03:22:41.874]  So thank you all, and get into InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:22:41.874 --> 03:22:45.358]  Get some great 2020 election shirts, supplements, and so much more.

[03:22:47.120 --> 03:22:47.360]  Thank you.
[03:22:48.673 --> 03:22:52.996]  All of the experts agree that getting proper sleep is the cornerstone of good health.
[03:22:52.996 --> 03:23:03.603]  It has been proven that a poor sleep schedule is linked with numerous health problems, including weight gain, memory issues, mood changes, poor concentration, and even a weakened immune system.
[03:23:03.603 --> 03:23:09.807]  Introducing RocketRest, the new product from our Dr. Jones Naturals line at InfowarsStore.com.

[03:23:18.332 --> 03:23:28.420]  Many competitors sleep formulas focus only on getting you to sleep, but Rocket Rest was specifically formulated to help you feel rested and ready to take on the next day.
[03:23:28.420 --> 03:23:36.246]  It uses a unique quick-release capsule system to ensure fast delivery of deep sleep support ingredients like melatonin and magnesium.

[03:23:48.533 --> 03:23:57.896]  Fourteen months ago, I told you that the global lockdown was going to kill tens of millions of people by starvation and was going to cause a global depression in the first world.
[03:23:57.896 --> 03:23:58.917]  And now it has.
[03:23:58.917 --> 03:24:05.979]  It was a no-brainer then that you should get high-quality, storable food and save it because it is insurance you can eat.
[03:24:05.979 --> 03:24:10.461]  And with all the inflation we knew was coming, that was one way to beat inflation.
[03:24:10.461 --> 03:24:11.481]  A lot of you listened.
[03:24:11.481 --> 03:24:12.562]  You did a great job.
[03:24:12.562 --> 03:24:13.202]  Some of you didn't.
[03:24:13.542 --> 03:24:17.925]  Now is the time to take action before food prices only continue to increase.
[03:24:17.925 --> 03:24:19.205]  Every index shows it.
[03:24:19.205 --> 03:24:22.247]  It's basically a guarantee, barring a miracle.
[03:24:22.247 --> 03:24:23.748]  And we wish it wasn't the case.
[03:24:23.748 --> 03:24:26.269]  But let's make lemonade out of these lemons.
[03:24:26.269 --> 03:24:34.554]  For only a few days more, until next Wednesday, May 12th, you can get 2020 prices still at preparewithalex.com.
[03:24:34.554 --> 03:24:41.398]  And then the prices are going to have to go back to what they were, still lower than most major competitors, and the food is the highest quality you're going to find.
[03:24:41.799 --> 03:24:43.763]  PrepareWithAlex.com!
[03:24:43.763 --> 03:24:44.786]  Take action now!

[03:24:50.151 --> 03:24:55.113]  One of the most popular memes on the internet in the last decade has been, Alex Jones was right.
[03:24:55.113 --> 03:25:04.017]  But it now routinely trends number one on platforms like Twitter and Facebook, making the globalists pull their hair out in anger.
[03:25:04.017 --> 03:25:06.479]  But let me tell you, we are tomorrow's news today.
[03:25:06.479 --> 03:25:07.439]  And thanks for your support.
[03:25:07.439 --> 03:25:11.661]  We're still on air at InfoWars.com and Bandai Video, radio stations, TV stations across the country.
[03:25:11.681 --> 03:25:12.602]  We're good to go.
[03:25:31.918 --> 03:25:33.419]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:26:27.727 --> 03:26:31.130]  Riders on the storm.
[03:26:31.130 --> 03:26:32.391]  We're definitely in the storm.
[03:26:32.391 --> 03:26:38.636]  Alright, we're gonna go to your phone calls right now.
[03:26:39.654 --> 03:26:41.696]  Really amazing taking these calls.
[03:26:41.696 --> 03:26:47.440]  One person calling in with a good story about the vaccines, but everywhere else you get censored on Facebook and Twitter and YouTube.
[03:26:47.440 --> 03:26:54.246]  Nurses, doctors, the people that have gotten sick, the people that have lost loved ones, tell their stories and they say, sorry, it's not allowed.
[03:26:54.246 --> 03:26:59.910]  And then the mother of Breonna Taylor, who the cops did accidentally shoot, a no-knock warrant.
[03:26:59.910 --> 03:27:01.912]  Rand Paul got a law passed to stop it.
[03:27:01.912 --> 03:27:03.273]  He got physically attacked for doing it.
[03:27:03.273 --> 03:27:05.955]  They kept saying, say her name when he's got to pass the law.
[03:27:05.955 --> 03:27:08.497]  Shows the ignorance of the left brainwashed minions.
[03:27:09.796 --> 03:27:16.182]  And even Breonna Taylor's mother says that Black Lives Matter are communists and don't don't help her or anybody else.
[03:27:16.182 --> 03:27:21.227]  She got taken off Facebook and blocked because they own her daughter now.
[03:27:21.227 --> 03:27:25.431]  They use her to cause a race war, not to get justice.
[03:27:25.431 --> 03:27:27.713]  Kate in Kansas, thanks for holding her on the air.
[03:27:27.713 --> 03:27:28.053]  Welcome.
[03:27:28.053 --> 03:27:28.714]  You are a nurse.
[03:27:28.714 --> 03:27:30.375]  Welcome.
[03:27:30.375 --> 03:27:35.580]  Yes, Alex, I am here to tell you that our health care industry is completely compromised.
[03:27:36.041 --> 03:27:37.622]  People need to know that.
[03:27:37.622 --> 03:27:42.485]  Principled people need to speak out, regardless of what the consequences may be.
[03:27:42.485 --> 03:27:46.567]  I have a friend who's a healthcare, married to a healthcare administrator.
[03:27:46.567 --> 03:28:03.517]  This man knows that this whole thing is fake, that these vaccines, so-called, I call them pseudo-vaccines, are deadly, and yet he has presided over vaccinating elderly people in a nursing home, preparing these vaccines for people who come into the clinic,
[03:28:03.999 --> 03:28:12.862]  Keeping the hospital going with vaccinated people, and I asked his wife why, and she said, if he doesn't do it, they'll lose their funding.
[03:28:12.862 --> 03:28:14.502]  And I said, let him lose it.
[03:28:14.502 --> 03:28:15.603]  Close it all down.
[03:28:15.603 --> 03:28:18.003]  I'd rather see it closed than these people killed.
[03:28:18.003 --> 03:28:18.424]  Well, that's right.
[03:28:18.424 --> 03:28:21.905]  All it's going to take is the administrators going public, because the whole thing's about money.
[03:28:21.905 --> 03:28:25.266]  $53,000 for somebody they intubate.
[03:28:25.266 --> 03:28:31.748]  No wonder Cuomo's like, we need ventilators, ventilators, because he's being paid off by those groups that came out to do that.
[03:28:31.748 --> 03:28:32.368]  Isn't that evil?
[03:28:33.527 --> 03:28:40.570]  It's totally evil and we need to start thinking about how we're going to build an alternative to the so-called healthcare system.
[03:28:40.570 --> 03:28:47.753]  I work in it and I know it's rotten from the inside out and there are compromises made all the time and I'm frankly disgusted with it.
[03:28:47.753 --> 03:28:50.193]  What are your colleagues saying about all this?
[03:28:50.193 --> 03:28:52.574]  Are they seeing through it?
[03:28:52.574 --> 03:28:56.356]  You know, Alex, the industry in which I work is so woke.
[03:28:56.356 --> 03:28:59.357]  It's all about Kamala Harris's
[03:29:00.146 --> 03:29:00.666]  I think?
[03:29:30.256 --> 03:29:34.657]  But we've got to build an alternative health care system and I'm... Well, let me tell you what's happening.
[03:29:34.657 --> 03:29:38.497]  I should be getting a lot of these names, but Sunday I'm going to go 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:29:38.497 --> 03:29:41.898]  We've already gotten the EMT's name that wanted to say more.
[03:29:41.898 --> 03:29:43.978]  If you've got time on Mother's Day, if you can, I understand.
[03:29:43.978 --> 03:29:45.999]  If you want to give us your name and number, we won't share it.
[03:29:45.999 --> 03:29:50.180]  We'll throw it away, you know, put it on a piece of paper and then throw it in the trash and shred it once you're on Sunday.
[03:29:50.180 --> 03:29:57.721]  But if you'd like to be on for, you know, five minutes, call you, put you directly on, not hold for an hour, I'd love to have you on to tell us more about that administrator.
[03:29:58.101 --> 03:29:59.102]  Hey Alex, how are you doing today?
[03:30:15.979 --> 03:30:21.201]  So am I, and we are first-time caller, but my husband and I, long-time listeners.
[03:30:21.201 --> 03:30:27.242]  Alex, just keep doing the good work, because we need you out there, Alex, giving us the information that you give us.
[03:30:27.242 --> 03:30:40.386]  Just want to put a plug in, all people that are listening, Ultimate Krill Oil, Survival Shield X2, Lung Cleanser, the pouches for your iPhone, Protective Eye Pouches, Alexa Pure Breathe,
[03:30:41.146 --> 03:30:52.073]  I'm just a little bit disappointed I can't find the super silver gel that you used to sell at one time but unfortunately it's not on your info store any longer and of course knockout.
[03:30:52.073 --> 03:31:03.540]  No ma'am the Democrats said that if I sold what's even sold in Walmart, that's sold in Walmart by the way so to let you know under the official name, if I sell that they will arrest me and of course it's unconstitutional but I can't do it.
[03:31:04.430 --> 03:31:05.211]  I'm disgusted.
[03:31:05.211 --> 03:31:07.772]  I'm totally disgusted with what's going on, Alex.
[03:31:07.772 --> 03:31:09.714]  But just let me get to my point.
[03:31:09.714 --> 03:31:13.756]  Four different incidences that I have just heard of.
[03:31:13.756 --> 03:31:16.598]  One family member took the shot.
[03:31:16.598 --> 03:31:17.479]  The two shots.
[03:31:17.479 --> 03:31:19.080]  She's elderly.
[03:31:19.080 --> 03:31:23.002]  Just yesterday found out that she was taken to emergency.
[03:31:23.002 --> 03:31:24.323]  Inflammation of the lungs.
[03:31:24.323 --> 03:31:26.865]  But they don't put two and two together, Alex.
[03:31:26.865 --> 03:31:28.426]  Another friend in Vegas.
[03:31:28.926 --> 03:31:32.229]  Our friend took the shot, the Johnson & Johnson.
[03:31:32.229 --> 03:31:34.772]  Next day, she's 19, blood clot.
[03:31:34.772 --> 03:31:37.494]  She's in the hospital on a ventilator.
[03:31:37.494 --> 03:31:42.118]  Another one, a family member, his blood pressure is out of control.
[03:31:42.118 --> 03:31:44.220]  Alex, I can go on and on.
[03:31:44.220 --> 03:31:45.522]  I am just so disgusted.
[03:31:45.522 --> 03:31:53.149]  My husband and I are so disgusted as to what is happening in our country, in our world, and people need to wake up.
[03:31:53.149 --> 03:31:54.590]  They're like zombies, Alex!
[03:31:56.109 --> 03:32:00.496]  They've been put in a trance and now they're being brain damaged and physically killed.
[03:32:00.496 --> 03:32:09.691]  And of course you can give them the UT study where they said any COVID vaccine attacks proteins in the body and eats holes in the lungs, liver, heart and brain.
[03:32:09.691 --> 03:32:10.412]  Can you believe that?
[03:32:11.888 --> 03:32:16.892]  Alex, we sent that pamphlet that you had.
[03:32:16.892 --> 03:32:19.174]  We sent it to our legislatures.
[03:32:19.174 --> 03:32:21.976]  We did not get a response from no one.
[03:32:21.976 --> 03:32:27.921]  I just want to pull my hair out of my head because I am just at a point, my husband and I are like, wake up!
[03:32:27.921 --> 03:32:28.841]  Wake up, people!
[03:32:28.841 --> 03:32:31.524]  You are brain dead!
[03:32:31.524 --> 03:32:32.264]  Well, you said it.
[03:32:32.264 --> 03:32:34.526]  Just keep fighting and keep praying and keep taking action.
[03:32:34.526 --> 03:32:35.347]  God bless you.
[03:32:35.347 --> 03:32:36.127]  Incredible, Jenny.
[03:32:36.127 --> 03:32:37.068]  Thank you.
[03:32:37.068 --> 03:32:38.469]  Okay.
[03:32:38.469 --> 03:32:39.370]  Let's talk to Lynn.
[03:32:41.044 --> 03:32:44.125]  From North Carolina, Lynn, go ahead.
[03:32:44.125 --> 03:32:46.266]  Alex, thank you for taking my call.
[03:32:46.266 --> 03:32:57.450]  I'm calling because my child goes to University of Florida, and they got notified that if they don't have the vaccine, they're not allowed to come to work or school, and they have to do testing every two weeks.
[03:32:57.450 --> 03:33:01.251]  And the testing, they stand in this line with people that are sick and think they have COVID.
[03:33:01.251 --> 03:33:03.452]  They don't separate the well people.
[03:33:03.452 --> 03:33:06.213]  Then they pass around the iPads everyone has to sign.
[03:33:07.003 --> 03:33:08.263]  And then you're on the app.
[03:33:08.263 --> 03:33:10.784]  If you don't go do your test, then you're not allowed to come into work.
[03:33:10.784 --> 03:33:11.684]  Well, that's right.
[03:33:11.684 --> 03:33:13.184]  Look, the colleges are collapsing.
[03:33:13.184 --> 03:33:15.445]  There'll be no jobs for most of these things soon.
[03:33:15.445 --> 03:33:15.965]  I'm sorry.
[03:33:15.965 --> 03:33:17.225]  You know, education used to be good.
[03:33:17.225 --> 03:33:20.966]  I'm not saying you're bad sending them there, but it's all going to fall anyways.
[03:33:20.966 --> 03:33:25.367]  And so some colleges are saying you can't leave the campus, you know, during your period there.
[03:33:25.367 --> 03:33:29.348]  This is cult programming, giant Milgram experiment.
[03:33:29.348 --> 03:33:35.409]  And so, A, you can go to a doctor and the doctor can say, oh, you have a history of allergic responses.
[03:33:35.409 --> 03:33:35.889]  Here's a letter.
[03:33:37.353 --> 03:33:40.175]  And so you're like, oh, you're going to make me take a shot when I'm not supposed to?
[03:33:40.175 --> 03:33:41.816]  There are ways to get around that.
[03:33:41.816 --> 03:33:44.277]  I guarantee you, the faculty's not taking the shots.
[03:33:44.277 --> 03:33:46.018]  They're just herding you in.
[03:33:46.018 --> 03:33:54.562]  And so he can either leave that place, or he can simply go get a psychologist and say he has an anxiety issue and get a letter.
[03:33:54.562 --> 03:33:58.144]  Or you can simply give them a Nuremberg Code, and then they try to take him out.
[03:33:58.144 --> 03:33:59.165]  Call Robert Barnes.
[03:33:59.165 --> 03:34:01.466]  He'll file a lawsuit.
[03:34:01.466 --> 03:34:02.326]  Yes.
[03:34:02.326 --> 03:34:05.388]  He's almost done with his PhD, so you'd hate for him to leave.
[03:34:06.454 --> 03:34:07.135]  Well, see, that's the thing.
[03:34:07.135 --> 03:34:08.516]  They're holding him hostage.
[03:34:08.516 --> 03:34:09.977]  And here's the deal.
[03:34:09.977 --> 03:34:11.238]  Maybe it doesn't hurt him right away.
[03:34:11.238 --> 03:34:12.559]  Maybe it never does.
[03:34:12.559 --> 03:34:15.121]  The point is, now they're saying you need booster shots for this.
[03:34:15.121 --> 03:34:16.463]  And then you've got to still wear your mask.
[03:34:16.463 --> 03:34:21.127]  I mean, our way of life's been destroyed.
[03:34:21.127 --> 03:34:24.329]  Until we totally dig out these globalists, things are not going back to normal.
[03:34:24.329 --> 03:34:25.430]  They're in control.
[03:34:25.430 --> 03:34:26.131]  They've got a media.
[03:34:26.131 --> 03:34:27.352]  We'll do whatever they're told.
[03:34:27.352 --> 03:34:28.713]  They've got unlimited money.
[03:34:28.713 --> 03:34:30.895]  They want to depopulate us.
[03:34:30.895 --> 03:34:31.896]  This is very sinister.
[03:34:33.177 --> 03:34:33.317]  Okay.
[03:34:43.467 --> 03:34:47.668]  Well, they're also got lots of special vaccine lots like these through the military.
[03:34:47.668 --> 03:34:49.029]  They're doing testing.
[03:34:49.029 --> 03:34:55.091]  You better know these universities are giving experimental shots to these guys and then bringing them through every two weeks.
[03:34:55.091 --> 03:34:56.652]  So this is medical experimentation.
[03:34:56.652 --> 03:34:57.552]  And why not?
[03:34:57.552 --> 03:35:03.154]  They're announcing the new booster shots are going to be patches with micro glass that goes into your skin so they can track you.
[03:35:03.154 --> 03:35:03.614]  Did you know that?
[03:35:05.604 --> 03:35:12.948]  No, but I mean, I believe anything now and I just, I've protected my child my whole life and now, you know, there's nothing I can do.
[03:35:12.948 --> 03:35:15.569]  Either you walk out and leave your degree.
[03:35:15.569 --> 03:35:18.410]  Listen, he can lead a student group against it saying he has rights.
[03:35:18.410 --> 03:35:24.574]  Instead of leaving, he should lead a group against it and they'll quietly call him in and say, we're going to give you a waiver.
[03:35:24.574 --> 03:35:27.015]  And then he'll know how evil it is and he won't want to stop.
[03:35:27.015 --> 03:35:28.495]  He'll need to lead a movement against them.
[03:35:28.495 --> 03:35:29.376]  The answer is
[03:35:30.468 --> 03:35:32.410]  If you get attacked and you lay down, you're crushed.
[03:35:32.410 --> 03:35:35.133]  If you get attacked and you fight back, you get stronger each time.
[03:35:35.133 --> 03:35:37.015]  You understand?
[03:35:37.015 --> 03:35:43.781]  Should have put it in the executive order that he banned mandatory vaccines, but he didn't ban coercion to take the vaccine.
[03:35:43.781 --> 03:35:44.742]  And this is coercion.
[03:35:44.742 --> 03:35:45.303]  It's force.
[03:35:45.777 --> 03:35:46.257]  That's right.
[03:35:46.257 --> 03:35:47.758]  It's called bullying.
[03:35:47.758 --> 03:35:53.342]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful products ever made.
[03:35:53.342 --> 03:35:54.383]  Alpha Power.

[03:37:15.996 --> 03:37:21.939]  Not because you've done something wrong, but because the big telecoms, big tech, and the globalists are predatory and are evil.
[03:37:21.939 --> 03:37:28.443]  And in this surveillance state, we need to more and more start doing everything we can to mitigate the criminal activity they're involved in.

[03:37:48.619 --> 03:37:57.307]  Listeners have rightfully been complaining the last six months or so saying, where are most of the best-selling products you have that we love?
[03:37:57.307 --> 03:38:00.189]  And my answer is the supply chain has broken down.
[03:38:00.189 --> 03:38:03.833]  I have to either reformulate or I have to lower the quality to get a lot of these.
[03:38:03.833 --> 03:38:06.215]  And so that's why we don't have a lot of products in.
[03:38:06.215 --> 03:38:10.499]  That's why InfoWars is in financial trouble, is because if we had the product, you would be buying it.
[03:38:10.499 --> 03:38:11.580]  We have the money.
[03:38:11.580 --> 03:38:15.503]  But so many of them have been sold out, just like you notice a lot of other items at the stores.
[03:38:15.563 --> 03:38:16.024]  I think so.
[03:38:34.907 --> 03:38:36.128]  Take advantage of this now.
[03:38:36.128 --> 03:38:36.689]  Stock up.
[03:38:36.689 --> 03:38:37.690]  And don't forget to take your X2.
[03:38:37.690 --> 03:38:41.774]  Because I have a tendency to forget how great it is and not take it myself.
[03:38:41.774 --> 03:38:45.477]  But when I do, stamina, libido, energy, weight loss, it's incredible.
[03:38:45.477 --> 03:38:46.358]  It's essential.
[03:38:46.358 --> 03:38:48.680]  It's X2 at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:38:48.680 --> 03:38:52.163]  Fourteen months ago, I began to sit on the broadcast every day.
[03:38:52.163 --> 03:38:54.486]  When the first world collapses, the third world dies.
[03:38:55.319 --> 03:39:07.218]  We have such a complex civilization with so many billions of moving parts that when you shut down the first world, it causes a chain reaction that will devastate the third world and really hurt the first world.
[03:39:07.218 --> 03:39:10.203]  Well, now you're hearing about gas shortages all over the United States.
[03:39:10.783 --> 03:39:17.467]  That's because the companies and the systems and the drivers that can barely get the job done before delivering gas have been shut down.
[03:39:17.467 --> 03:39:20.609]  Plus the Keystone Pipeline has been shut down along with other pipelines.
[03:39:20.609 --> 03:39:24.071]  The left is now blowing up dams across the U.S.
[03:39:24.071 --> 03:39:24.971]  We're being shut down.
[03:39:24.971 --> 03:39:27.292]  Our coal power plants are off as well.
[03:39:27.292 --> 03:39:29.714]  Ladies and gentlemen, prepare to be a total slave.
[03:39:30.234 --> 03:39:31.615]  The third world is imploding as well.
[03:39:31.615 --> 03:39:32.876]  The borders have been removed.
[03:39:32.876 --> 03:39:37.739]  Until you wake up and this is a globalist shycom takeover, Gregory said, you have no hope.
[03:39:37.739 --> 03:39:42.803]  They're announcing that there will be less than two-thirds of the guests needed this summer.
[03:39:42.803 --> 03:39:52.169]  So they told you that you're under lockdown one way or another and CNN laughed at you and your family.
[03:39:52.169 --> 03:39:54.791]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:40:09.035 --> 03:40:11.937]  The smell of death surrounds you.
[03:40:11.937 --> 03:40:12.097]  Look.
[03:40:25.968 --> 03:40:32.010]  The globalists see the public not working hard, the public being slovenly, the public being ugly.
[03:40:32.010 --> 03:40:34.912]  I'm pretty ugly compared to my ancestors.
[03:40:34.912 --> 03:40:47.837]  We're just not hard people like they were and we also eat all this poison GMO and they're just slowly poisoning all of us and their idea is if you don't know this and you don't mediate it and you don't get around it, you deserve to die.
[03:40:47.837 --> 03:40:53.279]  And I really wanted to spend a half hour today on the Antifa videos of them acting like police and attacking everybody and
[03:40:54.033 --> 03:41:06.816]  Going crazy, and I'll try to play a few of the clips, but I'll just have to... I'll have to do it on the Sunday show, but I said four hours of your calls with your stories, and I've been doing a pretty good job lately of getting to these calls, because they don't want this heard.
[03:41:06.816 --> 03:41:08.716]  They want this shut down.
[03:41:08.716 --> 03:41:20.018]  But again, they're collapsing the economy, and they're going to use a race war as the cover for the collapse, and then blame that on the race war, and the guilt of the American people, so the banks don't get blamed.
[03:41:20.018 --> 03:41:21.039]  That's the big one.
[03:41:21.039 --> 03:41:21.999]  Ties together with the COVID.
[03:41:21.999 --> 03:41:23.219]  That's a drill for martial law.
[03:41:25.181 --> 03:41:27.963]  But your calls actually are paramount above that.
[03:41:27.963 --> 03:41:30.725]  If I have the energy, I'm actually pretty exhausted right now for four hours.
[03:41:30.725 --> 03:41:33.827]  I usually take about an hour off to do some, you know, research.
[03:41:33.827 --> 03:41:36.169]  I call that off, not talking, before I go back on air.
[03:41:36.169 --> 03:41:37.970]  But maybe I'll pop in during the war room today.
[03:41:37.970 --> 03:41:40.211]  It's coming up here in about eight, nine minutes with Owen Schroer.
[03:41:40.211 --> 03:41:44.894]  I know he's got a big Friday show with a bunch of guests and calls lined up for you here on the InfoWars Network.
[03:41:44.894 --> 03:41:46.996]  The only way we reach new people is you sharing the links.
[03:41:46.996 --> 03:41:47.916]  So again, I thank you all.
[03:41:47.916 --> 03:41:49.437]  This is a war, as you now know.
[03:41:49.437 --> 03:41:51.959]  But I want to finish up with James, Russell, and Daniel.
[03:41:51.959 --> 03:41:54.501]  Then I'll play a few of those clips if we have time that I mentioned to Mandy.
[03:41:55.021 --> 03:41:55.962]  They're all over the place.
[03:41:55.962 --> 03:41:57.203]  It's just insane.
[03:41:57.203 --> 03:42:02.006]  And they just normalize this with the cops standing there while they're coming to cars, pointing guns at people.
[03:42:02.006 --> 03:42:02.747]  Get out of your car!
[03:42:02.747 --> 03:42:04.588]  And beating people up.
[03:42:04.588 --> 03:42:08.311]  And they sound like, you know, what the left says are bad cops.
[03:42:08.311 --> 03:42:11.713]  I mean, it's just because they want to be the cops.
[03:42:11.713 --> 03:42:13.155]  They're like pretending and LARPing.
[03:42:13.155 --> 03:42:16.077]  They're like a SWAT team stopping a bank robber.
[03:42:16.077 --> 03:42:16.477]  But they're not.
[03:42:16.477 --> 03:42:19.459]  They're just beating people up and attacking people.
[03:42:19.459 --> 03:42:23.162]  I mean, I just I couldn't be a cop and be around these people.
[03:42:25.217 --> 03:42:26.778]  I mean, it's just, it's just incredible.
[03:42:26.778 --> 03:42:29.178]  And they go, don't attack us while they attack you.
[03:42:29.178 --> 03:42:32.340]  The left is just trash.
[03:42:32.340 --> 03:42:33.740]  And I'm sorry, man.
[03:42:33.740 --> 03:42:36.061]  I love that with a metal baton, they start attacking them.
[03:42:36.061 --> 03:42:39.262]  We're going to slit your throat, all this stuff.
[03:42:39.262 --> 03:42:40.402]  I mean, it's just who they are, man.
[03:42:40.402 --> 03:42:42.123]  They love it.
[03:42:42.123 --> 03:42:43.223]  I see, I can't get around that.
[03:42:43.223 --> 03:42:46.124]  I'd go, I'd go King Kong on those people.
[03:42:46.124 --> 03:42:47.385]  I mean, I'm telling you, it'd be bad, man.
[03:42:48.754 --> 03:42:51.376]  I'm not saying I'm the toughest guy around, but I got a real problem.
[03:42:51.376 --> 03:42:55.479]  You want to punch my buttons, be five or six people saying you're going to kick my ass.
[03:42:55.479 --> 03:42:57.260]  That punches the buttons, man.
[03:42:57.260 --> 03:43:02.664]  That overwhelming group of people, that's when the big can of crazy man gets released.
[03:43:02.664 --> 03:43:04.745]  And that's when people start getting hurt really bad.
[03:43:04.745 --> 03:43:08.468]  I mean, even looking at it, I just, oh my God.
[03:43:08.468 --> 03:43:11.370]  I mean, those people would have their noses torn off, their heads bashed in.
[03:43:12.182 --> 03:43:15.183]  And then, uh, you know, somebody probably walk up and stab me from behind.
[03:43:15.183 --> 03:43:15.744]  I don't even care.
[03:43:15.744 --> 03:43:18.385]  Because I just destroy each person one at a time.
[03:43:18.385 --> 03:43:20.125]  Only takes about five seconds.
[03:43:20.125 --> 03:43:21.486]  You actually get a hold of them.
[03:43:21.486 --> 03:43:22.767]  By the way, anybody can do this.
[03:43:22.767 --> 03:43:24.587]  Anybody can kill really easy.
[03:43:24.587 --> 03:43:25.368]  People have governors.
[03:43:25.368 --> 03:43:26.728]  I don't have one.
[03:43:26.728 --> 03:43:28.889]  And five, six people sort of fight with me, even though I'm 47.
[03:43:28.889 --> 03:43:29.910]  I'm young.
[03:43:29.910 --> 03:43:32.031]  I just want to, I want to tear them to pieces.
[03:43:32.031 --> 03:43:33.531]  And I know a lot of you have that in you, too.
[03:43:33.531 --> 03:43:38.593]  And the left doesn't get that that whole veneer is starting to peel away, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:43:38.593 --> 03:43:39.894]  So, I don't have a governor.
[03:43:41.929 --> 03:43:49.057]  And, uh, man, we all have that instinct when a larger group than us is there to either run away or fight.
[03:43:49.057 --> 03:43:51.119]  And me, I fight forward.
[03:43:51.119 --> 03:43:52.241]  And that's why this is so dangerous.
[03:43:52.241 --> 03:43:53.382]  They're really trying to start a civil war.
[03:43:53.382 --> 03:43:55.104]  All right, shut up, Jones!
[03:43:55.104 --> 03:43:56.926]  God, you're a loud mouth.
[03:43:56.926 --> 03:43:58.748]  Daniel in Texas, go ahead, you're on the air.
[03:44:00.826 --> 03:44:01.827]  Yes, sir.
[03:44:01.827 --> 03:44:03.788]  I just had two questions.
[03:44:03.788 --> 03:44:16.115]  One, I was gonna see if you could, like, hold a call-in prayer session show, like a segment hour for, like, on Sunday or Sunday night or something.
[03:44:16.115 --> 03:44:18.057]  I think that's really smart.
[03:44:18.057 --> 03:44:22.259]  Beyond that, people tell their testimony and talk about God and talk about how we need God.
[03:44:22.259 --> 03:44:24.981]  In fact, I don't think that's just an hour of a show.
[03:44:24.981 --> 03:44:29.944]  I'll do the next Sunday or a special show next week dedicated to God.
[03:44:29.944 --> 03:44:30.264]  You're right.
[03:44:31.594 --> 03:44:31.814]  All right.
[03:44:31.814 --> 03:44:32.134]  Thank you.
[03:44:32.134 --> 03:44:32.835]  Thank you.
[03:44:32.835 --> 03:44:37.838]  Yeah, because on October 12, 2016, you prayed for Trump to win and I prayed right along with you.
[03:44:37.838 --> 03:44:39.779]  And I think that granted the prayer.
[03:44:39.779 --> 03:44:52.427]  But the reason I was calling in was because my brother, he's a physician's assistant and the physician basically owns the little thing and basically made him take the COVID shot.
[03:44:52.427 --> 03:44:59.331]  And I was wondering, can an employee take his employer to a small claims court?
[03:45:00.559 --> 03:45:07.802]  Yes, it's very immoral to try to make somebody say something experimental that's not even approved.
[03:45:07.802 --> 03:45:15.164]  And so that's slavery when that person wants to rape you and put something in your body so that they say you're clean.
[03:45:15.164 --> 03:45:16.165]  What a cult!
[03:45:16.165 --> 03:45:24.968]  Where you're in a cult where they don't just brand you like NXIVM, but they put GMO in you to show... I mean, it's crazy.
[03:45:26.980 --> 03:45:27.860]  Right, right, exactly.
[03:45:27.860 --> 03:45:32.943]  I mean, think about, you know, if you're married, your wife, you know, knows if she wants to have another baby or not.
[03:45:32.943 --> 03:45:33.463]  Sorry, go ahead.
[03:45:33.463 --> 03:45:42.767]  I was going to say, could you cite those Nuremberg trials and make them back down, like if an employer was trying to... Oh, yeah, I would just say, listen, I don't want any trouble, but yeah, absolutely.
[03:45:42.767 --> 03:45:49.831]  You know, just say, hey, I take my vitamins, I'm not, you know, the vaccine doesn't even protect you, but this is a fraud, Bill Gates is going to jail.
[03:45:49.831 --> 03:45:51.111]  But people don't even push back.
[03:45:51.111 --> 03:45:52.332]  You got to push back, Daniel.
[03:45:52.332 --> 03:45:52.832]  Thanks for the call.
[03:45:53.493 --> 03:45:56.796]  All right, let's go ahead and take a call from James in Iowa.
[03:45:56.796 --> 03:45:57.636]  James, you're on the air.
[03:45:57.636 --> 03:45:59.038]  Go ahead.
[03:45:59.038 --> 03:45:59.838]  Hey, Alex.
[03:45:59.838 --> 03:46:00.919]  I called yesterday.
[03:46:00.919 --> 03:46:05.763]  I was the one that called about my sister breastfeeding a baby and all that fun stuff.
[03:46:05.763 --> 03:46:07.724]  And the baby having the convulsions?
[03:46:07.724 --> 03:46:09.526]  Yes.
[03:46:09.526 --> 03:46:13.729]  So earlier today, I was catching up on other podcasts I was listening to.
[03:46:13.729 --> 03:46:18.393]  I listened to Mike Adams, the health ranger, and he was covering this document from John Hopkins
[03:46:19.122 --> 03:46:23.944]  It's called Technologies to Address Global Catastrophic Biological Risk.
[03:46:23.944 --> 03:46:26.625]  I don't know if your crew can pull it up for you.
[03:46:26.625 --> 03:46:27.646]  Yeah, say that.
[03:46:27.646 --> 03:46:28.966]  I actually saw an article on that.
[03:46:28.966 --> 03:46:29.647]  Say the name of it.
[03:46:29.647 --> 03:46:30.227]  Strategies 2.
[03:46:30.227 --> 03:46:31.768]  Say it again.
[03:46:31.768 --> 03:46:37.550]  Technologies to Address Global Catastrophic Biological Risk.
[03:46:37.550 --> 03:46:37.890]  All right.
[03:46:37.890 --> 03:46:39.611]  Tell me more.
[03:46:39.611 --> 03:46:45.654]  And basically, it addresses how they can basically course vaccinate
[03:46:46.463 --> 03:46:47.904]  Like the entire population.
[03:46:47.904 --> 03:46:54.086]  They talk about 3D printing, proteins, chemicals and biologics.
[03:46:54.086 --> 03:47:07.151]  They talk about how they can use drones to basically monitor the crops and if there's certain insects or something in there they can... Yeah, it's a total robot takeover of everything.
[03:47:07.151 --> 03:47:14.374]  But first they've got to collapse and sabotage human civilization so that we have to be saved by the robots and by the technocracy.
[03:47:15.060 --> 03:47:24.966]  I mean, before Jeff Bezos could have 100-story towers that drones fly out of, delivering us everything and we're locked in our houses, they had to collapse things first.
[03:47:24.966 --> 03:47:34.371]  And they even talk about, in this document, they talk about self-spreading vaccines, self-applying mRNA vaccines.
[03:47:34.841 --> 03:47:39.983]  Drone delivery, remote location, like they can use drones to deliver these.
[03:47:39.983 --> 03:47:41.684]  Oh my gosh, we got a deadly bioweapon out.
[03:47:41.684 --> 03:47:42.704]  You got to stay in your homes.
[03:47:42.704 --> 03:47:44.065]  The drones are coming.
[03:47:44.065 --> 03:47:45.605]  They haven't touched humans.
[03:47:45.605 --> 03:47:46.385]  They're safe.
[03:47:46.385 --> 03:47:47.546]  It's all been war-gamed.
[03:47:47.546 --> 03:47:49.087]  It's all in Klaus Schwab's documents.
[03:47:49.087 --> 03:47:50.867]  Say that again because the crew hasn't pulled it up yet.
[03:47:50.867 --> 03:47:52.288]  I'm sure Mike Adams wrote an article about it.
[03:47:52.288 --> 03:47:55.069]  I know I saw an article about it, I think, this morning or yesterday.
[03:47:55.069 --> 03:47:56.789]  Tell us the headline again.
[03:47:56.789 --> 03:47:59.050]  Technologies to address.
[03:47:59.050 --> 03:48:00.571]  Technologies to address.
[03:48:01.727 --> 03:48:03.568]  Global catastrophic.
[03:48:03.568 --> 03:48:05.589]  Global catastrophic.
[03:48:05.589 --> 03:48:07.291]  Biological risk.
[03:48:07.291 --> 03:48:08.111]  Biological risk.
[03:48:08.111 --> 03:48:09.052]  Thanks for the call.
[03:48:09.052 --> 03:48:10.953]  We'll look into that and do something on it.
[03:48:10.953 --> 03:48:12.974]  All right, Russell in California.
[03:48:12.974 --> 03:48:14.835]  You're on the air.
[03:48:14.835 --> 03:48:17.277]  Hey Alex, thank you for taking my call.
[03:48:17.277 --> 03:48:28.704]  Hey, I have a lot of health care professionals in my family and one of the things that scares them the most is that there is a possibility that we're tainting our blood supply.
[03:48:28.704 --> 03:48:28.944]  When
[03:48:31.265 --> 03:48:41.308]  What's the possibility of people who've been given the RNA vaccine being denied the ability to donate blood?
[03:48:41.308 --> 03:48:49.251]  What happens when you need blood transfusions and your RNA and you have two different blood types that you're submitting and they both have
[03:48:49.744 --> 03:48:52.526]  Well, that's right.

[03:49:16.878 --> 03:49:17.519]  Yes.
[03:49:17.519 --> 03:49:34.217]  And what do you do if you need an organ transplant or emergency blood supply, heart surgery and so forth when you're on anti-rejection medications and biologicals and this RNA vaccine?
[03:49:34.941 --> 03:49:36.903]  Thank you so much and God bless you.
