[00:00.000 --> 00:12.120]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.120 --> 00:22.200]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones it's
[00:22.200 --> 00:29.880]  3 3 15 hard to believe it's already marks third 2015 I'm your host Alex Jones Benjamin
[00:29.880 --> 00:34.480]  Netanyahu has been speaking for much of the hour continuing into this hour we're
[00:34.480 --> 00:39.320]  going to give you a blow-by-blow some of the things he's saying he's coming out
[00:39.320 --> 00:42.520]  saying days when Jewish people remain passive in the face of genocidal
[00:42.520 --> 00:49.920]  aggression are over we've got the latest with ISIS forces engaging in new
[00:49.920 --> 00:57.360]  battles inside Iraq and Syria Obama says he's very interested in raising taxes
[00:57.360 --> 01:01.680]  through executive action and the White House is defending bullet bands today
[01:01.680 --> 01:05.640]  with the White House spokesman saying that hey it's common sense for the
[01:05.640 --> 01:10.160]  president to act unilaterally basically as a dictator and a new video out linked
[01:10.160 --> 01:15.800]  on drudgereport.com with Mark Dice as Obama supporters endorsing Karl
[01:15.800 --> 01:20.560]  Marx as the next president of the United States we're going to go to that
[01:20.560 --> 01:25.200]  report come back and kick off our live coverage of Benjamin Netanyahu addressing
[01:25.200 --> 01:30.320]  Congress and more I'm Alex Jones Karl Marx has been an economic advisor to the
[01:30.320 --> 01:34.680]  Obama administration for many years Obama's decided to elevate him to the
[01:34.680 --> 01:39.840]  level of presidency full endorsement should we continue with that policy to
[01:39.840 --> 01:46.200]  lead us to the road of prosperity into the utopia we've all hoped for I feel if
[01:46.200 --> 01:53.720]  you all desire to we should that if he decides to lead on and try to pick
[01:53.720 --> 01:57.200]  better decisions I feel he would continue with the Marxist economic
[01:57.200 --> 02:03.600]  policies to lead us to the utopia that we've all really hoped for yeah Obama
[02:03.600 --> 02:08.440]  has chosen Karl Marx the economic advisor that he's had to be the next
[02:08.440 --> 02:13.400]  president for the Democrats you think that we should continue with his Karl
[02:13.400 --> 02:17.560]  Marx economic policies to lead us to the road to prosperity is that a wise
[02:17.560 --> 02:25.760]  decision sure sounds like the best plan of action right now we've come such a
[02:25.760 --> 02:31.120]  long way in the last you know six years seven years that Obama's been in office
[02:31.120 --> 02:37.040]  and so I mean he's probably saw Obama has been taking his economic advice from
[02:37.040 --> 02:43.200]  Karl Marx top Obama economic advisor now Obama chose him to become the
[02:43.200 --> 02:48.560]  nominee for the Democrats good decision continue down that road yes those
[02:48.560 --> 02:53.240]  policies lead us to the you know really the utopia that we've all been been
[02:53.240 --> 02:59.200]  hoping for yes I hope we can look forward to a good year coming up our
[02:59.200 --> 03:04.320]  election with Karl Marx continuing and passing on the baton and continue with
[03:04.320 --> 03:10.920]  those policies sure why not thank you very much thank you the 2016 presidential
[03:10.920 --> 03:14.120]  lecture right around the corner it's already talking about it already talking
[03:14.120 --> 03:19.360]  about it President Obama nominated Karl Marx his Treasury Secretary to become
[03:19.360 --> 03:23.400]  the nominee for the Democrats you think that's a wise decision on Obama's
[03:23.400 --> 03:26.360]  party you think you know I didn't go bomb is making a good decision right here
[03:26.360 --> 03:30.120]  I think he's gonna do good job in office and hopefully get selected and Karl
[03:30.120 --> 03:34.280]  Marx could rise from Treasury Secretary to President to continue his economic
[03:34.280 --> 03:37.320]  policies that would be awesome to see him rise because he's doing a good job so
[03:37.320 --> 03:42.080]  far and you know I only imagine yeah his economic policies as a president Karl
[03:42.080 --> 03:46.280]  Marx could maybe fix America right that would be pretty awesome you know it's
[03:46.280 --> 03:49.320]  right around the corner so I don't see why not we just need the right guy and
[03:49.320 --> 03:55.480]  Karl Marx seems to be best candidate so far who in the hell is Karl Marx he's
[03:55.480 --> 04:00.960]  been the the Treasury Secretary and an economic advisor for Obama for the
[04:00.960 --> 04:05.040]  last I'm way out of that loop my friend so I don't have any advice to give you
[04:05.040 --> 04:11.240]  doesn't ring a bell nope not at all any any thoughts on Karl Marx at all and
[04:11.240 --> 04:18.640]  what he's done for the country and his economic policies no they don't Karl
[04:18.640 --> 04:25.720]  Marx ring a bell at all of you doesn't ring a bell okay I'll have to google who
[04:25.720 --> 04:30.200]  Karl Marx is I don't know but I mean do you so no I gotta go okay we've
[04:30.200 --> 04:34.400]  trusted Obama this far do you think that we could trust him handing the baton
[04:34.400 --> 04:39.560]  off to Karl Marx to continue his economic policies and bring us back to
[04:39.560 --> 04:45.640]  prosperity I don't know maybe possibility you never know and at this point
[04:45.640 --> 04:49.760]  just got to let it happen and see pretty good idea wouldn't you say

[08:51.080 --> 08:57.200]  thinking about guns in a vastly different way enough enough enough enough the
[08:57.200 --> 09:01.440]  Department of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree
[09:01.440 --> 09:07.040]  it comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition and it's case late news 12
[09:07.040 --> 09:10.120]  Jeff Farrell discovered that clergy would help the government with
[09:10.120 --> 09:14.600]  potentially their biggest problem us so part of it is we have to break through
[09:14.600 --> 09:18.600]  our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to
[09:18.600 --> 09:21.520]  their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities if you got
[09:21.520 --> 09:26.640]  a business that you didn't build that somebody else made that happen
[09:26.640 --> 09:32.000]  mercury containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two new studies
[09:32.000 --> 09:36.240]  in the journal pediatrics black Hawk choppers soaring to the night sky but
[09:36.240 --> 09:41.200]  this is only a drill heavily armed officers in Watertown search for the
[09:41.200 --> 09:53.720]  suspect house-to-house it's a joint military training exercise involving
[09:53.720 --> 10:02.480]  local police also military I am inside I have two words for you
[10:02.480 --> 10:13.600]  the dramatic scene played out in front of our cameras parents grabbing their
[10:13.600 --> 10:17.320]  children and running after spending the night hunkering in their houses and
[10:17.320 --> 10:21.720]  then finding themselves face-to-face with the muzzle of a SWAT officers rifle
[10:21.720 --> 10:24.320]  they let them in the area they told them they could come in and now they're
[10:24.320 --> 10:29.120]  coming in like their trespassers punching and shoving people
[10:29.120 --> 10:36.120]  and we're not running and we're not backing down if you want to come and take us
[10:36.120 --> 10:44.080]  on the March the Empire is on the run live from the info wars.com studios it's
[10:44.080 --> 10:59.880]  Alex Jones
[10:59.880 --> 11:04.880]  the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will
[11:04.880 --> 11:12.720]  persist this is the heart of 1776 we're broadcasting worldwide on three three
[11:12.720 --> 11:17.760]  the third day of March 2015 Benjamin Netanyahu has just basically completed a
[11:17.760 --> 11:21.840]  lengthy speech before the Congress we're going to be breaking down some of the
[11:21.840 --> 11:26.600]  powerful things that he basically said because regardless of which side of this
[11:26.600 --> 11:30.360]  debate you're on there were some major statements the days when the Jewish
[11:30.360 --> 11:36.240]  people remain passive in the face of genocidal aggression are over broadcast
[11:36.240 --> 11:43.120]  networks refused to carry it in rage Pelosi freaks out on the floor we've
[11:43.120 --> 11:47.000]  got video of all of this we're going to be queuing up I mean I really am in a
[11:47.000 --> 11:50.800]  paradox here because I have a lot of problems with some of the things Israel
[11:50.800 --> 11:56.080]  does but at the same time I'm not an enemy of Israel and I know Israel is a
[11:56.080 --> 12:00.680]  diverse country that has been attacked at least seven times by major armies and
[12:00.680 --> 12:05.720]  by itself defeated them but then I also understand a lot of the Israel lobby is
[12:05.720 --> 12:10.480]  over here lobbying to secure a police state in the U.S. to secure their
[12:10.480 --> 12:18.240]  economic foothold and to secure the U.S. as a backstop for Israel to have a lot
[12:18.240 --> 12:25.040]  of resentment over the Israel lobby but my concern is no one looks at the
[12:25.040 --> 12:28.920]  defense lobby no one looks at the big banking lobby no one looks at the
[12:28.920 --> 12:34.080]  globalist giant Latin American lobby to open up the borders and attach to the
[12:34.080 --> 12:41.000]  welfare no one looks at the different cartels that are out there operating
[12:41.000 --> 12:47.240]  people only look at Israel and obsess on Israel all day and it's just not
[12:47.240 --> 12:52.920]  reasonable I really try to come to the truth with what's going on in the world
[12:52.920 --> 12:57.520]  and when they've had British Prime Minister's address Congress just a few
[12:57.520 --> 13:01.800]  years ago and when they've going back to Winston Churchill and when they've had
[13:01.800 --> 13:06.960]  other Israeli Prime Minister's address Congress or French President's address
[13:06.960 --> 13:13.120]  Congress it's almost always carried by television and so Obama said he wasn't
[13:13.120 --> 13:20.280]  going to watch it Pelosi freaked out and tried to keep him from speaking and I
[13:20.280 --> 13:24.640]  understand at a certain level this is about political grandstanding for Net
[13:24.640 --> 13:27.920]  and Yahoo's facing re-election I'm just being cold-blooded here and laying out
[13:27.920 --> 13:33.840]  the facts and by the Democrats and liberals worldwide with the socialists
[13:33.840 --> 13:39.520]  that are anti-Israel to the core but then there's the paradox of the
[13:39.520 --> 13:43.920]  Democratic leadership getting massive money from different arms of the Israel
[13:43.920 --> 13:49.440]  lobby and so the whole thing's very incestuous very hard to figure out but
[13:49.440 --> 13:56.240]  at the bottom of the barrel and at the bottom of the whole situation if you go
[13:56.240 --> 14:01.080]  to a leftist event they are promoting Karl Marx they are promoting the end of
[14:01.080 --> 14:03.800]  the family they are promoting world government they are promoting violent
[14:03.800 --> 14:08.760]  revolution they are promoting attack the police and they are promoting Israel is
[14:08.760 --> 14:16.400]  the source of all evil and handing out and selling anti-Semitic pamphlets then
[14:16.400 --> 14:25.400]  the very same group will run around claiming brown bags or racist and having
[14:25.400 --> 14:29.920]  a fiesta party at your fraternity is racist no people like to wear sombreros
[14:29.920 --> 14:35.600]  and get drunk and have a food truck come with enchiladas the Mexican fraternities
[14:35.600 --> 14:42.240]  have those too the Hispanic fraternities it's it's the very same group in the
[14:42.240 --> 14:46.920]  left will hype racism that is non-existent or exaggerate stuff that's
[14:46.920 --> 14:53.760]  there in vestigial to create infighting and vulcanization while obsessing 24-7
[14:53.760 --> 15:01.920]  on Jews and it's acceptable in leftist ideology to kind of go along with the
[15:01.920 --> 15:09.360]  idea that there is a Jewish conspiracy of colonialism that's the spin the Klan
[15:09.360 --> 15:17.160]  says it's a Jewish conspiracy of banking and then the left says no it's a Jewish
[15:17.160 --> 15:25.520]  conspiracy of basically fascist capitalism and then when you look at it
[15:25.520 --> 15:29.280]  you know most legends like this have some kernel of truth there are a bunch of
[15:29.280 --> 15:33.280]  big financiers and people like the Rothschilds that are Jewish there are a
[15:33.280 --> 15:38.600]  bunch of fed chairman and people of the past that have been Jewish and
[15:38.600 --> 15:42.600]  certainly that's something that Jews a lot of Jews work to be in the top of
[15:42.600 --> 15:46.760]  finance because it's a very prestigious position just like you go in to find the
[15:46.760 --> 15:50.480]  top heart surgeon and maybe out of ten of them in your city you know half of them
[15:50.480 --> 15:55.920]  are Jewish so I mean nobody can deny the fact that Jews are on average over
[15:55.920 --> 16:00.800]  achievers high educations all I know is this is this statement that Jews are
[16:00.800 --> 16:05.120]  evil inherently when Jews are such a diverse group of people and constantly
[16:05.120 --> 16:08.600]  fighting with each other like every other group and runs the gamut from right
[16:08.600 --> 16:17.800]  wing to communist to libertarian like Aaron Russo it or Matt Drudge or so
[16:17.800 --> 16:23.560]  many others I'm just sick of the stereotyping and then the globalist above
[16:23.560 --> 16:29.560]  that the very same globalist that use socialism as their control system they
[16:29.560 --> 16:38.280]  are using Jews as again the bygone boogeyman to basically scapegoat the
[16:38.280 --> 16:42.320]  whole debate and just say well if it wasn't for Jews there wouldn't be any
[16:42.320 --> 16:46.400]  problems in this world really mouse a tongue killed eighty something million
[16:46.400 --> 16:52.720]  people you believe the Chinese numbers CIS is 65 64 66 million there weren't any
[16:52.720 --> 16:58.040]  Jews involved in that last time I checked and and I've just seen losers
[16:58.040 --> 17:03.440]  throughout my life who will blame a racial or religious group for all of
[17:03.440 --> 17:07.960]  their problems because they themselves don't want to get up and work hard and
[17:07.960 --> 17:13.400]  take action and work with other people and have a good attitude that's what it
[17:13.400 --> 17:17.600]  comes down to and this comes from somebody who's been savaged by the
[17:17.600 --> 17:22.480]  leftist arm of the Jewish lobby the not so much the Israel lobby because again
[17:22.480 --> 17:25.600]  there's subgroups within all these groups too simple just to use one name
[17:25.600 --> 17:31.360]  they've lied about me they've come after me they've demonized me they've said I'm
[17:31.360 --> 17:34.960]  anti-Semitic they've said I'm racist they said I want to get cops killed I
[17:34.960 --> 17:40.040]  mean George Soros is a Jew and he's a Nazi collaborator who helped round up
[17:40.040 --> 17:43.600]  and fair it out and rob Jews he admits it he's proud of it he said he's not
[17:43.600 --> 17:49.080]  ashamed of it he quote survived the guy runs organizations dedicated to
[17:49.080 --> 17:54.240]  shutting down talk radio internet freedom and this show he gave 196 million
[17:54.240 --> 17:58.300]  with the US government matching him and the Ford Foundation the four
[17:58.300 --> 18:01.320]  foundations basically governmental that came out in Congress in the 70s and the
[18:01.320 --> 18:05.700]  church committees Anthony Sutton got the documents so the globalist in the
[18:05.700 --> 18:09.960]  government wanted to destroy me so if being anti-Semitic means I'm against a
[18:09.960 --> 18:14.320]  Nazi collaborator Jew who's anti-free speech and anti-America then I'm
[18:14.320 --> 18:18.440]  anti-Semitic you better believe it just like both my grandfathers in World War
[18:18.440 --> 18:22.040]  2 must have been anti-Semitic both almost dying in the Army Air Corps I'm
[18:22.040 --> 18:26.360]  sick of it and I'm tired of it I don't like a bunch of the stuff Israel's doing
[18:26.360 --> 18:30.400]  Israel's corrupt like any other country let's get that straight and stop acting
[18:30.400 --> 18:33.960]  like it's on a pedestal and can do no wrong we should criticize Israel when
[18:33.960 --> 18:37.920]  Israel does evil corrupt stuff like helping fund al-Qaeda to take down
[18:37.920 --> 18:43.840]  Libya and take down Syria and that is immoral and wrong but you can't just
[18:43.840 --> 18:48.200]  get obsessed over Israel involved you got to then say Turkey Saudi Arabia the
[18:48.200 --> 18:54.760]  US France NATO British intelligence up to their eyeballs in it and that's my
[18:54.760 --> 19:00.200]  point is that you cannot just sit there and point at one group and say they're
[19:00.200 --> 19:05.400]  the problem it's more complex than that the Rothschilds are on record at least
[19:05.400 --> 19:09.320]  one of the five arms of the family financing Hitler you can look that up
[19:09.320 --> 19:13.280]  but then some Rothschilds didn't get out France or were killed by the Nazis
[19:13.280 --> 19:17.560]  there's been books written on it a lot of rich Jews ran operations with the
[19:17.560 --> 19:21.560]  Nazis fencing Jews out of Europe making them pay them money or only going to
[19:21.560 --> 19:26.840]  Israel that's why people like Dr. Pachinik who's Jewish is so angry at the
[19:26.840 --> 19:31.040]  Jewish lobby because he knows a lot of them are the children of rich Jews who
[19:31.040 --> 19:36.400]  made their fortunes sucking off Jews like Madeleine Albright so I mean these
[19:36.400 --> 19:42.200]  are the dirty secrets and and you know as someone who is a lay historian it's
[19:42.200 --> 19:46.680]  just all right there and it's too complex and so there's an obsession with
[19:46.680 --> 19:50.720]  Jews and obsession with Israel I'm obsessed with people and their personal
[19:50.720 --> 19:55.160]  ideas and what they stand for like Martin Luther King said that's what I'm
[19:55.160 --> 19:58.160]  into we'll be back to talk about Netanyahu's speech take your calls and

[24:16.480 --> 24:26.480]  Alex Jones here back live we're going to be going over some of Benjamin Netanyahu's
[24:26.480 --> 24:30.080]  speech I want to give you the American people but also folks living in the
[24:30.080 --> 24:36.080]  Middle East folks living in Israel a chance to call in and give us your take
[24:36.080 --> 24:41.800]  first-time callers on what you think of Netanyahu's speech and the bizarre arm
[24:41.800 --> 24:47.960]  flapping and chicken with a head cut off behavior of Obama and Pelosi trying to
[24:47.960 --> 24:52.960]  keep him from speaking the network's not carrying it running around freaking out
[24:52.960 --> 24:59.800]  are they trying to give the US cover politically when Israel strikes Iran is
[24:59.800 --> 25:05.640]  this all just theater the smart money is on that but that's at the top of the
[25:05.640 --> 25:11.360]  pyramid below that there is real hatred for Israel and this is the experience
[25:11.360 --> 25:14.760]  I've had I know Israel's diverse different political parties different
[25:14.760 --> 25:19.440]  ideas I have a love hate relationship with some of the people that are in
[25:19.440 --> 25:22.760]  Israel some of the things that have been done to me for no reason there's a lot
[25:22.760 --> 25:26.160]  of bullying because Israel feels like Israel's right so you better get a
[25:26.160 --> 25:29.600]  hundred percent behind Israel you're the enemy that's wrong and that's why
[25:29.600 --> 25:34.760]  Israel's lot it's lost a lot of support in the world that said Israel is not the
[25:34.760 --> 25:39.920]  end all be all only thing on the planet and I don't mean by the Israelis having
[25:39.920 --> 25:42.320]  that view of themselves everybody thinks they're the center of the universe
[25:42.320 --> 25:45.960]  wherever they live at that's what Texans think that's what Americans think
[25:45.960 --> 25:49.000]  that's what Germans think it's what Chinese think it's what Mexicans think
[25:49.000 --> 25:53.760]  that's just normal I'm talking about people outside of Israel and the Arabs
[25:53.760 --> 25:58.160]  and and all these Arab countries won't let the Palestinians in won't give them
[25:58.160 --> 26:02.240]  aid the Palestinians constantly try to overthrow whatever country they're in
[26:02.240 --> 26:07.080]  I'm not demonizing the Palestinians I'm just saying they're used as a political
[26:07.080 --> 26:13.360]  football to manipulate everyone and Israel is held to a higher standard and
[26:13.360 --> 26:19.040]  it is a religion to hate Israel so I've got a lot of problems with Israel some
[26:19.040 --> 26:21.600]  of the people in Israel some of the political parties some of the groups
[26:21.600 --> 26:27.000]  but at the same time it's a paradox because I've never experienced more
[26:27.000 --> 26:35.320]  vitriolic hatred as I have from the anti-Israel crowd they will make stuff
[26:35.320 --> 26:42.200]  up they will exaggerate they will lie everyone is a Jew I don't care if your
[26:42.200 --> 26:51.200]  last name's Jones Richardson Green Johnson Sanchez Chen everyone is a Jew
[26:51.200 --> 26:55.200]  the Jews are all powerful they're running everything I never had success I
[26:55.200 --> 26:58.680]  wasn't a good talk radio host I never barred a dime but they claim I'm
[26:58.680 --> 27:04.000]  financed by secret Jewish cabals it's very frustrating to be included on all
[27:04.000 --> 27:08.280]  the Nazi websites out there and white supremacist websites photo shopped in
[27:08.280 --> 27:15.680]  it you know Jewish events literally fake videos you name it that I'm some
[27:15.680 --> 27:20.280]  Israeli agent never been to Israel I do want to travel there it's amazing I'm
[27:20.280 --> 27:24.000]  told to see all that history I want to go to Syria that's got even more ruins
[27:24.000 --> 27:29.320]  and Roman stuff so I'm just sick of all the ignorance basically and I'm tired of
[27:29.320 --> 27:34.320]  sitting here watching the anti-Israel crowd degenerate by the minute and then
[27:34.320 --> 27:37.280]  Israel feeling like it's totally in circles getting more and more out of
[27:37.280 --> 27:41.240]  control and all these nuclear weapons this is a dangerous situation I want
[27:41.240 --> 27:46.480]  prosperity and when you really study politics and how the world works you
[27:46.480 --> 27:51.360]  find out Israel has been as bad as the US or Germany or England three of the
[27:51.360 --> 27:57.080]  worst for the worst I guess it's secret testing and by the way Israel didn't get
[27:57.080 --> 28:02.400]  caught doing testing on Arabs they got caught testing on Jews
[28:02.400 --> 28:13.080]  Sephardic Jews which genetically are true undisputed Jews they are a proto
[28:13.080 --> 28:17.520]  genetic group pre-Arab before African invasions of much of the Middle East
[28:17.520 --> 28:24.680]  because that's what an Arab is is part Anglo part Asian and part African I'm
[28:24.680 --> 28:29.720]  just a fact that's what Arabs are is a hybrid and if you look at Sephardic
[28:29.720 --> 28:34.720]  Jews they have a genetic template that predates from bones they've dug up to
[28:34.720 --> 28:41.240]  about six seven thousand years ago in that region of groups pretty much out of
[28:41.240 --> 28:46.440]  Europe what is Europe today so you have this whole argument about Ashkenazi Jews
[28:46.440 --> 28:50.440]  and the anthropology and they're not really Jews because they're from what's
[28:50.440 --> 28:56.080]  Georgia today or north of Georgia it's it's just it's Europeans ladies and
[28:56.080 --> 29:01.240]  gentlemen and then you've got later permutations of Jews in Babylonian
[29:01.240 --> 29:06.440]  captivity in Egyptian captivity and other captivity and so you do have an
[29:06.440 --> 29:12.360]  Arab line of genetics in the Jews but that's who they are so when you get into
[29:12.360 --> 29:16.160]  this a more ancient text claiming there's these lost tribes in Europe that's
[29:16.160 --> 29:23.640]  because that's what's so ridiculous about all this is that Jews original Jews
[29:23.640 --> 29:29.440]  are just Europeans in the Middle East and then you've got just all of this
[29:29.440 --> 29:33.880]  idiocy it is it is just pure absolute idiocy and then the modern Jews are
[29:33.880 --> 29:38.440]  part Arab so being anti-Semitic means being anti-Arab too it's just all the
[29:38.440 --> 29:41.880]  public is so ignorant about this and the governments play us off against each
[29:41.880 --> 29:48.840]  other I'm gonna give the number out 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 I want to take

[33:23.240 --> 33:32.240]  look at rogerport.com we have hillary clinton secret email released hdr 22 at
[33:32.240 --> 33:39.040]  clinton email.com he created a secret email for government activities which
[33:39.040 --> 33:43.840]  was illegal about the articles right here with former prosecutors saying it's
[33:43.840 --> 33:51.200]  clearly illegal remember the former head of the EPA she had to step down she had
[33:51.200 --> 33:57.440]  to step down a few years ago what was her name CJ her name is Lisa Jackson that's
[33:57.440 --> 34:02.800]  right Lisa Jackson Lee or whatever it was thank you we're teleprompter free but
[34:02.800 --> 34:08.080]  sometimes when I have a brain flatulence as they're scientifically called the guys
[34:08.080 --> 34:14.280]  come to my aid with the information I need so she had to step down because that
[34:14.280 --> 34:19.440]  was illegal does this ruin the hillary chances to run I hope so can jeb bush
[34:19.440 --> 34:23.760]  just sit down and shut up and can Hillary Clinton just sit out and shut up
[34:23.760 --> 34:31.320]  we've had enough jeb bushes and Hillary Clinton's I've got an article here today
[34:31.320 --> 34:37.160]  showing how Goldman Sachs is pumping money at record levels into both of
[34:37.160 --> 34:40.800]  these establishment people and let's go back to that article the crew just found
[34:40.800 --> 34:46.000]  and put on screen there's a blast from the past what 2013 two years ago
[34:46.000 --> 34:51.940]  newly released email show EPA directors extensive use of fictional alter ego
[34:51.940 --> 34:55.840]  fake email and no one's really doing that tie-in then I've seen we should have
[34:55.840 --> 34:59.320]  one of our great writers whether it's Steve Watson ball Watson but on Salazar
[34:59.320 --> 35:04.640]  Kit Daniels Kurt demo Mikhail failing or someone else do an article saying will
[35:04.640 --> 35:14.640]  Hillary be punished like the EPA had for fake emails because it is illegal on so
[35:14.640 --> 35:19.760]  many fronts there are a lot of developments unfolding ladies and
[35:19.760 --> 35:26.120]  gentlemen that will also be breaking down as as the next few hours progresses
[35:26.120 --> 35:32.760]  but today at least for the balance of this hour ahead of several guests joining
[35:32.760 --> 35:40.960]  us we can talk about the Jewish obsession I don't have one I mean I've
[35:40.960 --> 35:48.400]  got friends that are Jews I respect Jewish culture I respect culture across
[35:48.400 --> 35:53.080]  the board I don't hate people I don't hate black people I don't hate Hispanics
[35:53.080 --> 35:59.200]  I don't hate white people if I'm in the deep South and somebody makes a smart
[35:59.200 --> 36:04.200]  mouth comment about what are you doing around here Yankee I don't bow up to
[36:04.200 --> 36:09.240]  folks I understand that's all they've got and that 99% of people in the South
[36:09.240 --> 36:14.080]  are not like that and then I know that in the South in some towns they call
[36:14.080 --> 36:19.120]  people in the town next to them Yankees it just means outsider but then I don't
[36:19.120 --> 36:24.000]  put movies out and make fun of everybody in the South like Hollywood does I
[36:24.000 --> 36:29.920]  understand how cultures work and I want to empower humanity and the globalist
[36:29.920 --> 36:35.760]  are using vulcanization to do the opposite of that I don't want to destroy
[36:35.760 --> 36:40.040]  Israel I want to reform Israel I don't want to destroy the police departments I
[36:40.040 --> 36:43.560]  want to reform the police departments I don't want a revolution I want a
[36:43.560 --> 36:51.600]  restoration of Americana free freedom-based values Lord Moncton is
[36:51.600 --> 36:57.360]  joining us from science and public policy to break down the latest carbon
[36:57.360 --> 37:02.440]  tax push and more and to give his take on other geopolitical affairs and then
[37:02.440 --> 37:06.760]  Joel Gilbert because we've had members of Congress and others come out and
[37:06.760 --> 37:12.480]  basically say that Obama is heavily connected wink-wink to a famous
[37:12.480 --> 37:17.160]  communist pornographer wink-wink who he admittedly lived with for a long time
[37:17.160 --> 37:23.040]  wink-wink and who is pretty much a dead ringer for his father that was quote
[37:23.040 --> 37:28.240]  best friends with his grandfather so we're gonna have Joel Gilbert on just
[37:28.240 --> 37:33.640]  to discuss Obama in general and to get his take on what's currently unfolding
[37:33.640 --> 37:38.560]  and more but I do want to go to your phone calls on the subject of Israel and
[37:38.560 --> 37:45.880]  Benjamin yet in Yahoo because I don't see this as Israel good everybody else
[37:45.880 --> 37:50.320]  bad or Israel bad everybody else good I see this as what's really going on
[37:50.320 --> 37:55.920]  geopolitically right now and what does all this stand for well if Israel is
[37:55.920 --> 38:00.040]  really getting ready to hit Iran Iran is probably gonna respond with asymmetrical
[38:00.040 --> 38:03.920]  warfare they'll call it terrorism in the news that will then be used to take my
[38:03.920 --> 38:10.400]  freedoms it will hurt the economy and and it could cause a nuclear war but
[38:10.400 --> 38:14.880]  then I also get Israel's perspective when Iran constantly shoots their mouths
[38:14.880 --> 38:18.840]  off there's always apologists out there saying oh they didn't really say that
[38:18.840 --> 38:23.120]  no Iran the government of Iran really does say stuff like we're gonna new
[38:23.120 --> 38:26.680]  queue we're gonna blow you up we're gonna push into the sea the Zionist regime
[38:26.680 --> 38:32.320]  well the Zionist regime is the millions of Jews that live there and and so here's
[38:32.320 --> 38:35.880]  the issue for all the anti-Semites and all the people that think of they slip
[38:35.880 --> 38:40.760]  on a banana peel a Jew did it do you understand Israel probably has around
[38:40.760 --> 38:46.240]  800 nuclear weapons the most high-tech type they've got German submarines to
[38:46.240 --> 38:54.560]  launch the cruise missiles they've got medium-range ballistic missiles they've
[38:54.560 --> 39:00.520]  got tactical weapons and they've got spies all over the place in the Middle
[39:00.520 --> 39:05.480]  East and in Europe and you name it I mean it's like a Mexican standoff a nice
[39:05.480 --> 39:09.080]  point and guns at each other let's just not pull the trigger let's all just sit
[39:09.080 --> 39:12.360]  out and order some food and kick back and order a glass of wine and not kill
[39:12.360 --> 39:17.000]  each other like Ron Paul says so he's demonized and you got a lot of factions
[39:17.000 --> 39:20.400]  the military industrial complex want more war you got a lot of crazies in the
[39:20.400 --> 39:24.920]  Middle East want more war you got Israel involved with the West all guilty like
[39:24.920 --> 39:28.920]  our military said two years ago of arming al Qaeda to attack Syria a war
[39:28.920 --> 39:34.080]  crime killing Christians I'm very angry with Israel I'm very angry with our own
[39:34.080 --> 39:40.800]  government I'm very angry with Turkey let's see I'm not especially angry with
[39:40.800 --> 39:47.840]  Israel because I'm not a mindless hater I hate the criminals that globally came
[39:47.840 --> 39:53.320]  up with the decisions at the Bilderberg group club of Rome globalist level and
[39:53.320 --> 39:57.960]  then everybody from Saudi Arabia to Israel to Turkey to France to the United
[39:57.960 --> 40:03.680]  States got in line to engage in war crimes all of the Middle East using
[40:03.680 --> 40:10.720]  proxy armies out of Saudi Arabia shame on Israel shame on Benjamin Netanyahu
[40:10.720 --> 40:15.640]  and shame on everybody out there that purely worships him as a messianic
[40:15.640 --> 40:20.120]  leader and thinks whatever Alex you better get behind Israel I'm not against
[40:20.120 --> 40:24.680]  Israel but doing things like this funding al Qaeda in the Middle East is
[40:24.680 --> 40:29.920]  evil and then sitting around saying we've got to attack Iran they're funding
[40:29.920 --> 40:34.360]  al Qaeda because al Qaeda's enemies with Iran people say well Alex that's a
[40:34.360 --> 40:38.680]  Machiavellian move that's how you win no that's how you lose the moral high
[40:38.680 --> 40:45.680]  ground but I'll say this shame on the US government shame on France shame on
[40:45.680 --> 40:50.160]  NATO oh no no no don't do that only see areas covered up for Israel that's the
[40:50.160 --> 40:56.600]  mental illness of just you know what the anti-Semites worship Jews I think
[40:56.600 --> 41:03.080]  that's what it comes down to is that I don't dislike the NFL but I'm sick of
[41:03.080 --> 41:06.120]  that's all you hear about for four or five months out of the year and most
[41:06.120 --> 41:09.280]  men don't have a life they just obsessed on the NFL all day employee fantasy
[41:09.280 --> 41:13.800]  football it's mentally ill and the same thing I don't hate Israel but man I'm
[41:13.800 --> 41:18.960]  sick of it I'm sick of hearing about it I'm sick of all the people on both sides
[41:18.960 --> 41:23.800]  all vitriolically you know feeling like they're on the right side when it's all
[41:23.800 --> 41:32.960]  a big manipulation that's what it comes down to you got Saudi Arabia financing
[41:32.960 --> 41:36.640]  anti-free speech initiatives in the US you got Israel financing anti-free
[41:36.640 --> 41:40.440]  speech initiatives you got George Soros doing it you got left wing right wing
[41:40.440 --> 41:44.280]  you got every special interest group out there trying to shut down free speech
[41:44.280 --> 41:48.960]  and trying to take our guns so America the big empire can be their toy to go
[41:48.960 --> 41:52.760]  out and be a bully and take over the world for whoever fill in the blank and
[41:52.760 --> 41:59.160]  here's the deal I'm sick of paying for it like Rand Paul says I don't want to give
[41:59.160 --> 42:04.760]  aid to China we give billions to them I don't want to give aid to Israel I don't
[42:04.760 --> 42:10.200]  want to give aid to Egypt I don't want to give aid to anybody not Mexico no one
[42:10.200 --> 42:16.000]  I'm sick of it I don't want to pay for Chinese and Mexican and German women to
[42:16.000 --> 42:19.920]  come here and have their babies paid for me put on welfare and see it advertised
[42:19.920 --> 42:24.880]  on CNN how great it is to do it yeah I don't like he legals getting free in
[42:24.880 --> 42:29.000]  state tuition and free scholarships and then I got to pay for it yeah you're
[42:29.000 --> 42:32.720]  right because I hate Latin Americans if I came down there and got everything free
[42:32.720 --> 42:36.640]  from them they'd really be upset with me I'm sick of unfairness I'm sick of
[42:36.640 --> 42:41.960]  garbage and I'm sick of people who were ignorant and the only reason the global
[42:41.960 --> 42:44.600]  listen get away with this is because the public is ignorant I'm gonna go to your
[42:44.600 --> 42:52.520]  phone calls Jim Allen John Brian Slee-stack and others coming up here in
[42:52.520 --> 42:56.440]  just a moment but look at these type of clips I want to play this clip
[42:56.440 --> 43:01.360]  White House spokesman Josh Ernest says ammo ban proposal is common sense
[43:01.360 --> 43:06.040]  there's another clip a little jewel from him this morning Obama won't watch
[43:06.040 --> 43:09.800]  Netanyahu's speech to Congress and I'm not really going over his speech
[43:09.800 --> 43:13.760]  check it's more of the same it's a repeat of what he said to a pack days when
[43:13.760 --> 43:20.280]  Jewish people remain passive in the face of genocidal aggression are over he
[43:20.280 --> 43:28.880]  says the talks going on paved the way to Iran to get the bomb Iran's from what
[43:28.880 --> 43:33.880]  I've been told I mean look Pakistan's got it got about a hundred India's got
[43:33.880 --> 43:38.120]  a couple hundred China's got a couple thousand South Africa had nukes for
[43:38.120 --> 43:42.120]  heaven's sakes back in the 80s Saudi Arabia it basically brags they've got
[43:42.120 --> 43:45.360]  nukes now come like Israel does we're gonna see we have nukes but look out I
[43:45.360 --> 43:49.120]  mean do you really believe the Saudis don't have nukes they bragged last year
[43:49.120 --> 43:51.920]  they had them and I told you years before they did because I have high level
[43:51.920 --> 43:58.200]  sources high level everybody knows it so from people I trust in special
[43:58.200 --> 44:04.520]  operations in other areas that they've seen the scans they've seen the scans
[44:04.520 --> 44:12.320]  from satellite that picks up the trace immanences the the the the the trace
[44:12.320 --> 44:19.800]  radiation of fissile material configured that matches the signature of
[44:19.800 --> 44:26.600]  basically atomic bombs the difference is what Iran has is tanker toys compared
[44:26.600 --> 44:30.160]  to what Israel has and do you really think the moolas that were doing backroom
[44:30.160 --> 44:33.760]  deals with Ronald Reagan to hold the hostages till they did arms transfers
[44:33.760 --> 44:41.000]  in Iran contra I mean the moolas were put in by the CIA in 79 and this has all
[44:41.000 --> 44:45.920]  been declassified in a double cross of the Shah who wasn't playing ball with
[44:45.920 --> 44:50.160]  the globalist they gave him a weak you know version of cancer you know those
[44:50.160 --> 44:53.040]  sped-up versions that kills you in a week one of those on those overnight
[44:53.040 --> 44:57.760]  cancers see I happen to really know the real history of all this which you could
[44:57.760 --> 45:02.680]  find out two of you wanted to I'm talking to new listeners out there I mean I ran
[45:02.680 --> 45:07.520]  I'm not saying the globalist run Iran either it's just that it's all a divide
[45:07.520 --> 45:11.480]  and conquer strategy let's let's play that clip of White House spokesman Josh
[45:11.480 --> 45:14.600]  earnest because this is the stuff that's going on or busy obsessing over
[45:14.600 --> 45:17.120]  Israel
[45:19.040 --> 45:23.720]  hey I kind of like that it's like a chipmunk it's being considered through its
[45:23.720 --> 45:28.480]  standard process and it's open now for public comment and that we are looking at
[45:28.480 --> 45:32.320]  additional ways to protect our brave men and women in law enforcement and believe
[45:32.320 --> 45:36.800]  that this process is valuable for that reason alone this seems to be an area
[45:36.800 --> 45:39.880]  where everyone should agree that if there are armor piercing bullets available
[45:39.880 --> 45:44.160]  that can fit into easily concealed weapons that it puts our law enforcement
[45:44.160 --> 45:48.600]  at considerably more risk so I put this in the category of common sense steps
[45:48.600 --> 45:53.320]  that the government can take this is how they passed the 68 gun control act
[45:53.320 --> 45:58.880]  it's basically only used on law-abiding citizens in made crime explode the idea
[45:58.880 --> 46:03.600]  that oh they can conceal bullets that could kill cops all bullets are human
[46:03.600 --> 46:14.200]  killers that includes police and 223 is used in a fraction all assault weapons
[46:14.200 --> 46:18.760]  the statistic out from the Justice Department if yours goes 2% and then
[46:18.760 --> 46:28.240]  what's 223 of that let's say it's half a guesstimate that's 1% so if they can
[46:28.240 --> 46:31.960]  bring down the AR-15 or they can bring down the 223 they can bring it all
[46:31.960 --> 46:38.560]  down let's go to your phone calls Jim in West Virginia you're on the air thanks
[46:38.560 --> 46:47.640]  for calling yeah hi Alex I watched the excellency being introduced today it
[46:47.640 --> 46:53.360]  just seemed like a total dictatorship trying to preach to the US Congress and
[46:53.360 --> 46:59.600]  that really upsets me I think it was a vice versa that wouldn't happen to me it
[46:59.600 --> 47:05.160]  is just you know a scam but he never did mention what is the good deal what is he
[47:05.160 --> 47:11.720]  so upset about what seems to be aggravating him it was all poor Israel
[47:11.720 --> 47:17.800]  Israel history background and the things we know we know the Holocaust every year
[47:17.800 --> 47:24.400]  we're constantly reminded of it we never will be allowed to forget it but what is
[47:24.400 --> 47:31.720]  the deal that he was talking about why is he so upset well the deal is to let
[47:31.720 --> 47:36.520]  Iran have supposedly peaceful reactors that get inspected and not be able to
[47:36.520 --> 47:41.560]  build up enough reactors to actually produce a bomb for 10 years and Iran's
[47:41.560 --> 47:47.080]  already said that it's not acceptable and so I think Israel's issue is they're
[47:47.080 --> 47:52.800]  not going to let Iran become a nuclear power or Iraq and that they will attack
[47:52.800 --> 47:58.240]  like they did Iraq in 1980 or 1981 I forget which year it was and that they
[47:58.240 --> 48:02.720]  have a right to self-determination to do it and I think the issue is is that
[48:02.720 --> 48:08.800]  Israel is kind of like the 51st state but it's all also people don't like the
[48:08.800 --> 48:13.000]  fact that Israel has diplomatic immunity of a type where where Jews can commit
[48:13.000 --> 48:17.040]  crimes here in the US then run back to Israel and then Israel will protect them
[48:17.040 --> 48:20.840]  that there's a lot of things about Israel that upset me that I criticize that
[48:20.840 --> 48:25.240]  are unfair that's why we talk about it whole right of return thing pick a side
[48:25.240 --> 48:29.040]  decide you know it's like Ronald manual didn't fight in the US Air Force he was
[48:29.040 --> 48:35.840]  an officer in Israeli Air Force and and and so this is the thing that that
[48:35.840 --> 48:41.920]  sticks in people's craw and I fully understand it I'm just saying there are
[48:41.920 --> 48:45.480]  a lot of other issues I mean basically the Saudi Arabians of diplomatic
[48:45.480 --> 48:48.720]  community the United Nations is diplomatic community they're now giving the
[48:48.720 --> 48:53.480]  big carbon tax banks diplomatic community so this is what globalism is is a new
[48:53.480 --> 48:59.880]  class where if you're a UN bureaucrat or you're a mercenary or you're an Israeli
[48:59.880 --> 49:05.840]  or you work for the Vatican or you work for the UN or any of the NGOs that are
[49:05.840 --> 49:11.080]  part of it you're now literally above the law I mean Houston police and New
[49:11.080 --> 49:16.920]  York police have caught UN diplomats with slaves chained up they've caught
[49:16.920 --> 49:22.160]  them with trucks full of cocaine they cannot stop them or arrest them so yeah
[49:22.160 --> 49:26.720]  I don't like Israel basically having diplomatic community but I don't like
[49:26.720 --> 49:31.680]  the other couple dozen groups either that's what I'm saying Israel's going
[49:31.680 --> 49:36.240]  with a pattern that's been done before by other groups and it's a very
[49:36.240 --> 49:41.080]  successful pattern it is exploitive of many people in the Middle East that's
[49:41.080 --> 49:47.520]  well known it's exploitive of poor Jews coming out of Europe coming into Israel
[49:47.520 --> 49:52.720]  I mean I remember Israel got caught selling organs of political dissidents
[49:52.720 --> 49:57.040]  and denied it and called doctors that exposed it in Europe anti-Semites and
[49:57.040 --> 50:03.120]  it came out it was true talk about evil but but here's the deal our military
[50:03.120 --> 50:07.240]  got caught with private contractors taken organs in Iraq it turns out Saudi
[50:07.240 --> 50:12.040]  Arabia is selling them so is China humans act the same our problem is evil
[50:12.040 --> 50:19.840]  people and bureaucracies and our problem is when a group does something evil that
[50:19.840 --> 50:23.680]  group tends to cover it up to protect the group when all that does is discredit
[50:23.680 --> 50:26.600]  the group I mean like police departments that cover up corruption end up
[50:26.600 --> 50:30.760]  collapsing from corruption long-term it feels good for a while but it destroys
[50:30.760 --> 50:34.520]  them same thing with Israel when Israel says we're under attacks we can do
[50:34.520 --> 50:39.120]  whatever we want Israel becomes as bad as any other group they claim they're
[50:39.120 --> 50:43.640]  fighting and so that's where I stand with that we'll play some of BB's
[50:43.640 --> 50:47.480]  introduction it always makes me sick whenever a US president speaks to the
[50:47.480 --> 50:53.760]  UN they call him your Excellency but we'll play the intro of BB being
[50:53.760 --> 50:58.840]  introduced we'll be right back stay with us
[50:58.840 --> 51:02.480]  Harvest right the makers of the only in-home freeze dryer would like to
[51:02.480 --> 51:06.200]  present to you their greenhouses that double as emergency shelters their
[51:06.200 --> 51:10.280]  greenhouse is simply snapped together no tools needed as a greenhouse it will
[51:10.280 --> 51:14.880]  stand for decades it's incredibly strong long-lasting and it can be quickly
[51:14.880 --> 51:19.520]  put up or taken down it is also ideal when used as an emergency shelter learn
[51:19.520 --> 51:23.240]  more about this great greenhouse and the money you can save over the big box
[51:23.240 --> 51:29.400]  store prices at harvest right calm that's harvest right calm by now you
[51:29.400 --> 51:33.360]  heard about bitcoins but did you know that over 65,000 businesses accept

[53:58.360 --> 54:19.640]  I have the higher privilege and distinct honor of presenting to you the
[54:19.640 --> 54:30.040]  prime minister of Israel his Excellency Benjamin Netanyahu within a 42nd
[54:30.040 --> 54:36.960]  standing ovation that is disgusting to use the word Excellency that is you in
[54:36.960 --> 54:44.400]  speak when they introduced kings and Israel was usually actually low key
[54:44.400 --> 54:52.800]  about titles and uniforms so that is not an Israeli affectation pretty soon we're
[54:52.800 --> 54:55.400]  gonna start calling the bushes and the Clintons if they get elected to another
[54:55.400 --> 55:01.320]  term your Excellency we're gonna move Lord Moncton back to 20 after so I can
[55:01.320 --> 55:05.160]  continue with your calls before he comes on with a lot of breaking important
[55:05.160 --> 55:11.040]  news we've got a couple other clips here that will play when we start the next
[55:11.040 --> 55:20.520]  hour with Netanyahu explaining why he's against the Iran deal and I got to say I
[55:20.520 --> 55:26.560]  don't get his point that a nuclear attack on Israel is imminent when he's got
[55:26.560 --> 55:35.640]  800 nuclear weapons and high-tech delivery systems it's very simple Netanyahu
[55:35.640 --> 55:40.680]  in the clip we're gonna play gets into the fact that well inspectors don't stop
[55:40.680 --> 55:47.520]  the work inspectors just report back well you got cameras and inspectors and
[55:47.520 --> 55:53.760]  then Iran can be self-sufficient because they can't even refine enough oil to
[55:53.760 --> 55:57.680]  supply their country refineries are very expensive and very complex if they
[55:57.680 --> 56:03.720]  can't have nuclear power they can't become self-sufficient and so it's wrong
[56:03.720 --> 56:13.000]  to say to Iran you can't have reactors but everybody else can and Israel can I
[56:13.000 --> 56:17.600]  get the point that Iran has a lot of really strong rhetoric and that's wrong
[56:17.600 --> 56:23.080]  Netanyahu goes on we're gonna play the clip to say that just because Iran is
[56:23.080 --> 56:32.400]  fighting ISIS doesn't mean they're good well just because Israel and the US
[56:32.400 --> 56:35.320]  funded al-Qaeda to attack a bunch of innocent countries doesn't mean al-Qaeda
[56:35.320 --> 56:43.360]  is good yeah Benjamin BB I get it and I think Israel's a little jealous that the
[56:43.360 --> 56:48.640]  US military is working with Iran to clean out some of the ISIS groups and it's
[56:48.640 --> 56:53.280]  all a very sick situation and our military doesn't like it but I just
[56:53.280 --> 56:57.480]  don't know what we're supposed to do you know let Israel attack well that's
[56:57.480 --> 57:03.200]  their that's their prerogative but what happens then when it drags Russia into it
[57:03.200 --> 57:07.600]  and there are a lot of Christians and I'm a Christian myself but there's these
[57:07.600 --> 57:12.600]  interpretations of cheerleading for the end of the world and getting all
[57:12.600 --> 57:18.720]  excited that oh Israel's gonna go into Syria and go into Iran it's gonna start
[57:18.720 --> 57:23.600]  nuclear war and then Jesus is gonna come back you know so many people in
[57:23.600 --> 57:26.400]  Nazi Germany Christians that were rounded up and put in forced labor camps
[57:26.400 --> 57:31.400]  they thought it was the end of the world Hitler was the Antichrist I guess the
[57:31.400 --> 57:35.080]  Bible says there are many many Antichrist I forget which passage that is
[57:35.080 --> 57:41.560]  but regardless ladies and gentlemen I don't want a nuclear war let's jam in
[57:41.560 --> 57:44.040]  one more caller in a minute and a half we have before we go to break Brian in
[57:44.040 --> 57:48.080]  Missouri what's your take on the BB speech yeah I've got a theory for you
[57:48.080 --> 57:54.000]  speaking of end of the world as a segue you know the ancient prophets Jeremiah
[57:54.000 --> 57:59.520]  did talked about the coming destruction of a Babylon or Babylon John talks
[57:59.520 --> 58:04.560]  about the destruction in the desert of the heartlet of the Babylon each of
[58:04.560 --> 58:10.680]  those specifically talks about the flying scrolls that fly and destroy the
[58:10.680 --> 58:16.920]  three ancient cities in the desert and that they need the baskets to set them
[58:16.920 --> 58:22.320]  on there's a part of me that thinks that what they're trying to do is get
[58:22.320 --> 58:28.680]  technology into Iran so that Iran can not only take care of ISIS but also take
[58:28.680 --> 58:35.400]  care of the what has gone on with Saudi Arabia for the last time finish your
[58:35.400 --> 58:39.720]  point we come back stay with us second hour straight up

[59:55.480 --> 01:00:11.960]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:19.480]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:34.480]  Alex Jones
[01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:39.560]  all right we're talking about the Benjamin Netanyahu BB speech that
[01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:45.040]  concluded about an hour ago Brian in Missouri was getting into what he thinks
[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:51.360]  biblically is happening why would the West be backing Iran after backing Al Qaeda
[01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:55.960]  for four years to destabilize the region or is it really just to get the Arabs
[01:00:55.960 --> 01:01:02.760]  all killing each other in an inner Arab inner Muslim Shiite Sunni religious war
[01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:09.040]  which again is incredibly immoral to go start a war that will kill millions but
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:12.920]  that's been the policy I mean pretty much that's what this comes down to and then
[01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:19.120]  Israel feels threatened by Iran and wants to escalate into a strike and has
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:24.600]  that lined up with Saudi Arabia so it is a real conundrum what's your take on
[01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:29.040]  that Brian well yeah just to finish I think this is why the
[01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:34.960]  mustadas against Netanyahu because Netanyahu may not be you know in the
[01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:39.240]  loop on all this and the bottom line is each of these scrolls come from the
[01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:44.040]  plains of Shinar which is where modern day nuclear facilities for Iran are
[01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:48.840]  located so at the end of that the big double triple cross is going to come
[01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:53.400]  when Iran takes care of the dirty work for the US and then actually has a deal
[01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:56.720]  cut with Russia well you're right and the Bible is wild it talks about flying
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:02:02.880]  scrolls blowing up mountains and you know crafts in the sky that look like
[01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:07.160]  metal insects raining down fire I mean it just sounds like Apache helicopters
[01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:11.960]  the Bible is really wild and if it's science fiction how come so much of it
[01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:22.640]  keeps coming true what's your take on that statement Brian well you know yeah
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:27.880]  it's not something you can do just with a simple phone car conversation and
[01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:34.880]  obviously much has been written by this but all right brother well listen I
[01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:38.200]  appreciate your call we're going to take some more calls on the Israel
[01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:43.880]  situation because even if you're sick of it like I am because it never gets
[01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:48.400]  fixed it never ends it's just a big crisis and special interest make money
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:53.320]  out of all the globalists play with our lives like we're nothing but pawns the

[01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:05.000]  think of Netanyahu's speech and what is it distracting us from Alan in
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:11.720]  Washington DC go ahead hi good morning welcome afternoon rather I want to note
[01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:16.360]  that Chris Matthews on MSNBC right after the speech that quote too many people
[01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:19.680]  were smiling during the Netanyahu's speech just another example of the
[01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:24.920]  partisan division that they turn this into but the bigger picture I think is
[01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:31.280]  who is Barack Obama who's negotiating with Iran and I want to alert you of
[01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:35.920]  research I've done I've connected the Obama birth certificate cover-up in
[01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:41.080]  Hawaii to a eugenics think tank at the East West Center I've connected the
[01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:46.280]  mother of the twins who founded Planned Parenthood to Alvin Onaka who is I've
[01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:51.120]  connected to the Population Association of America and the American Eugenics
[01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:55.760]  Society both organizations that go back to Margaret Sanger and if you just type
[01:03:55.760 --> 01:04:02.280]  in in Google Hawaii official who certified White House certificate of
[01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:07.920]  life birth and mother of twins who claim to remember President Obama's birth
[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:15.680]  both tied to U.S. government eugenics think tank that's send us a link to that
[01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:19.440]  we'd like to research that and if it's accurate post it I know that if you look
[01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:23.160]  at Mother Jones magazine or any of these leftist publications they'll have
[01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:28.360]  ads from the Population Associations in there that are the eugenics
[01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:35.600]  organizations and it's true that Obama had like a pod person upbring all these
[01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:41.680]  CIA people all these cutouts it mean he is he is definitely manufactured and you
[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:44.960]  really can't figure out who he is really talking about that with Joel Gilbert

[01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:52.720]  executive actions on the Second Amendment and now Town Hall reports Obama
[01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:58.680]  quote very interested in raising taxes through executive action he already
[01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:02.680]  massively raised taxes on the poorest Americans something he promised he wouldn't
[01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:07.800]  do after manipulating them to vote for him via class warfare and of course he's
[01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:13.160]  got Republicans that basically work for the same globalist operation helping
[01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:19.040]  him get Obamacare through helping him get the open borders through set to vote
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:24.800]  on that today in the Homeland Security Bell or tomorrow helping him on every
[01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:30.080]  front and not blocking the FCC power grabbing the internet that they're
[01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:34.400]  moving on every front right now and this is red-linked we'll put it on screen at
[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:41.040]  infowars.com we've already reported that I'm getting reports from our sources
[01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:45.600]  around the country and seeing local stories like in Gonzales Texas where the
[01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:50.840]  DEA and FBI were voted into the police department with grants not just to
[01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:55.160]  advise or have deputy officers that are quasi federal but to actually be
[01:09:55.160 --> 01:10:01.560]  stationed in the police department Obama to expand federal control over state
[01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:06.160]  local police like Common Core DOJ to develop standards for state and local
[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:10.280]  agencies and then of course penalize them if they don't follow federal orders
[01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:13.720]  the Obama administration released a plan to expand federal control over state
[01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:18.840]  local law enforcement that's after the media
[01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:24.320]  hypes that the put there's an epidemic of evil police killing everybody and it's
[01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:28.960]  just like guns really gun crime is way down but the media shows it and hypes
[01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:34.640]  it and the perception is there's more crime with guns I'll be honest 15 years
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:39.000]  ago 10 years ago I took the bait and and saw police doing unconstitutional
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:43.960]  things doing things bad departments robbing people at checkpoints I got
[01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:47.840]  very mad and kind of projected it on police in general and played right
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:53.160]  along at a primitive level with George Soros and others playing but as more
[01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:56.760]  and more of it came out and I watched what they do in Greece and other
[01:10:56.760 --> 01:11:01.520]  countries they're doing this by design in 2002 we got the IMF World Bank
[01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:07.560]  documents when Joseph Stiklitz left the World Bank where they said we train the
[01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:11.840]  police we give them tactics that make them unpopular then we organize a
[01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:15.440]  movement against them so you don't have a revolution against the crooks at the
[01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:19.920]  top of the government to fix the country you blame the lowest level person
[01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:26.400]  given the unconstitutional orders you scapegoat them as society breaks down
[01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:31.040]  and then you basically overthrow that group and then put in your own people so
[01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:35.000]  they're playing us off against each other and I told you that he would announce
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:41.480]  federalization of police and there it is I mean over the weekend the statesman
[01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:46.880]  USA Today New York Times the Austin Chronicle I turn on television bad cops
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:50.320]  bad cops cops are bad cops are bad cops are gonna rob you cops are gonna kill
[01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:54.120]  you cops are gonna cops are gonna and as much as I don't like some thug
[01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:58.880]  Yosemite Sam cop in a power trip telling me I can't videotape a
[01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:01.360]  demonstration and threatening me I get in their face and tell them I'm gonna
[01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:05.880]  assume don't violate my First Amendment but I'm against that person violating my
[01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:11.880]  rights and their rights I am not gonna just sit here and get manipulated into a
[01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:18.640]  civil war that's focused at the police the globalist hate veterans they hate
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:23.040]  people trained to use weapons they hate local government they hate the police
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:27.200]  everything they do shows it in George Soros just like he funded the internet
[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:33.520]  takeover funded the anti cop movement and I will not go along with that piece
[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:38.320]  of trash and I see through everything these people are doing and I'm telling you
[01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:42.800]  I just got chills I really did we are in so much peril right now I mean the enemy
[01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:48.240]  is moving on every front and you can see their battle plan all over the place
[01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:53.520]  we need to reform our legislatures we need to reform our police everything bad
[01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:58.040]  I'm talking 95% of the bad stuff that cops are doing is federal grants
[01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:04.160]  checkpoints federal grants black uniforms tasers instant shooting you
[01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:09.760]  know no hesitation training demonization of the Patriots it's all the
[01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:12.960]  globalists that have occupied the federal government trying to get the
[01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:17.640]  police to be basically their henchmen so that when the public attacks the police
[01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:21.400]  while the feds and the globalists direct the public to do so the feds will
[01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:25.440]  then be the savior with guidelines and training so oh we won't come after you
[01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:29.400]  when you shoot somebody I mean you get cities of millions of people you're
[01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:33.000]  gonna get innocent people get shot and it's a tragedy you're gonna get cops
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:36.200]  that are scared shooting people you're gonna get crazy psycho cops that
[01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:39.760]  occasionally shoot someone in handcuffs they should have the book thrown at them
[01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:44.480]  they should be put under the jail that then protects your local government and
[01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:49.880]  your county your city and your rule of law cops get taught by the feds how to
[01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:54.520]  cover stuff up then the feds come in double cross them take them over and
[01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:58.000]  here it is we're gonna go back to your calls the Obama administration released
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:02.000]  a plan to expand federal control over state and local law enforcement the
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:06.960]  plan released Monday entitled task force 21st century policing advocates the
[01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:10.880]  federalization of police agencies just Iran corporation national stability
[01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:15.080]  force it's always the same thing the plan released Monday entitled task force
[01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:18.440]  21st century policing advocates the federalization of police agencies
[01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:21.960]  across the country by forcing them to adhere to stricter requirements when
[01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:26.200]  they receive federal funding which is our money to begin with it's just
[01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:33.280]  ridiculous and then it just goes on from there the US Department of Justice
[01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:36.920]  for the office of community-oriented policing services and office of
[01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:40.400]  justice programs should provide technical assistance and a sense of
[01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:43.720]  funding to jurisdictions with small police agencies and take steps towards
[01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:48.080]  sharing services regional training and consolidation that's the state's job not
[01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:51.760]  the fed's job one of the numerous recommendations the plan this of course
[01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:55.000]  will be run by the Justice Department that states fast and furious and lets
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:59.480]  the big banks rob us and lets derivatives be put on the people's back the
[01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:03.040]  plan also calls for the feds to collect more law enforcement data yeah it's
[01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:09.920]  gonna be federally mandated wireless jacked in it's all in the plan cameras
[01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:15.160]  on the cops you're like oh that's good no because then they're gonna nickel and
[01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:20.920]  dime the good cops for doing nothing and then they're gonna quote classify and
[01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:23.880]  cover up stuff that's really bad I'm telling you this is selective
[01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:29.600]  enforcement and it's gonna be horrible I'm for local squad car cameras and the
[01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:33.280]  cops have little digital cameras that's great but if the cops all have to have
[01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:37.080]  GPS and the cops will have to have cameras on all the time what's gonna
[01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:41.960]  happen to us well guess what's coming out cameras in all your cars you can't
[01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:47.000]  turn off Toyota announced it four years ago BMW is announcing it I mean careful
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:54.400]  what you wish for boys and girls fact this is a very serious plan and I know
[01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:57.480]  we can link through to the plan let's get some screenshots of the plan let's
[01:15:57.480 --> 01:16:01.400]  show some of the recommendations great job kid Daniels churning that report out
[01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:06.200]  at info wars.com and prisonplanet.com
[01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:13.800]  meanwhile we're busy obsessing over Israel and Iran I mean I'm just so sick
[01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:21.240]  of it I'm so sick of Iran Iran Saudi Arabia oh Saudi Arabia is angry they
[01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:26.560]  don't have to go to the TSA but citizens do exactly everything is for us none of
[01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:31.480]  it is for security it's for a power grab the federal threat fusion centers are in
[01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:37.240]  there federalizing our local police and it's despicable and it's dangerous and
[01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:41.040]  it's out of control we should have a separation of powers we should have
[01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:44.280]  state local and federal to keep everybody honest the problem is the feds
[01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:51.120]  have been taken over publicly by global government do I need to play clips right
[01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:56.640]  now of CNBC repeatedly saying foreign banks run America aren't we all just
[01:16:56.640 --> 01:17:03.120]  slaves essential banks I mean that's a fact folks we've been conquered
[01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:10.960]  sleep stack in FEMA region for what former state are you in sleep stack okay
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:15.560]  let's pipe them through or maybe sleep stacks gone that work you got him yeah
[01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:20.200]  go ahead sleep stack I mean you go ahead and talk I might let you go yeah yeah
[01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:26.000]  absolutely you know basically as far as all the Israel criticism I definitely
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:30.720]  agree that people are completely over the top you know and I couldn't agree with
[01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:35.200]  you more on that subject however I don't feel like you emphasize the Israeli
[01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:39.680]  involvement in 9-11 quite enough because I mean you have guys like Wayne Madsen
[01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:44.040]  come on even they talk about I know the Saudis were definitely involved too but
[01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:48.720]  I just feel like as far as as far as criticism you know I defend you a lot
[01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:53.120]  when people mention a lot of that stuff I don't need you I don't want you to
[01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:58.080]  defend me because you know I made a film I produced a film
[01:17:58.080 --> 01:18:02.800]  fabled enemies that is about Israeli involvement in 9-11 that is criminal
[01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:06.880]  elements working with Saudi intelligence as they do closely and I talk about it
[01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:11.000]  all the time just like Israel's involved with Turkey and Saudi Arabia right now
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:15.840]  with Al Qaeda and I had Joe Scowze on yesterday talking about Israeli Arab spies
[01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:21.640]  inside ISIS so it's like I have people say you I don't cover the Federal
[01:18:21.640 --> 01:18:28.560]  Reserve or I don't cover I mean it's just not true so but but fine I mean go
[01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:31.680]  ahead you're on air we need to screen your call tell us about Israeli
[01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:35.320]  involvement see that's the way to do it just call in and talk about it because
[01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:39.960]  no one's censoring you right right well I'm just saying is you know the all the
[01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:45.400]  cats like you know Michael Chertop, Dovzakheim, the Israeli security at
[01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:50.560]  airports and all the PNAC involvement with Phillip Zellekow, Paul Wolf with
[01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:56.520]  Richard Pearl, Douglas Spice, George Tennant it's basically lately I've just
[01:18:56.520 --> 01:19:00.960]  been you know hearing you talk about the 28 pages and who knows exactly what
[01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:06.080]  they're gonna say but you know I just hear this constant you know Saudi Arabia
[01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:10.560]  Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia and it's like yeah absolutely but well that's because
[01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:13.800]  that's in the 28 pages and we know where the hijackers came from we know there
[01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:17.640]  was a stand-down I've interviewed the head of the US Embassy visa section who
[01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:22.000]  exposed all this 14 years ago on the show so I know we can prove that and I
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:25.960]  can prove the government covered it up and stood down and that's enough to send
[01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:31.760]  Al Capone to prison baby I will take what I can prove yeah absolutely well I
[01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:35.000]  fully support you Alex well God bless you brother and I appreciate you and

[01:24:14.920 --> 01:24:19.880]  this is a syndicated radio broadcast in the main but we also have a full TV
[01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:24.280]  production here at info wars dot com forward slash show I already have cable
[01:24:24.280 --> 01:24:29.840]  systems and TV stations picking the broadcast up live via internet streams
[01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:33.760]  some of them then downloading it and playing it later even before we
[01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:38.800]  officially launch on satellite and other systems in the near future but our
[01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:43.080]  main audience is a hundred and seventy plus M&F and affiliates and of course the
[01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:47.040]  giant amount of folks watching the video enlisting the audio streams and the
[01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:50.760]  way we reach more people is you out there spreading the word so thank you so
[01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:57.000]  much and we'll go to Regina Steve Alex abdye Dan and others that are
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:01.800]  patiently holding after Lord Moncton leaves us hearing about 25 minutes or
[01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:06.840]  so Lord Christopher Moncton of course was the top adviser to Margaret Thatcher
[01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:12.760]  he's a scientist researcher journalist ran major newspapers in the UK he now
[01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:18.720]  runs science and public policy dot org he helped prove that Al Gore's film an
[01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:23.680]  inconvenient truth was an inconvenient fraud had it basically removed from UK
[01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:26.540]  schools because they had to put a disclaimer in that polar bears could
[01:25:26.540 --> 01:25:29.920]  swim and penguins could swim in the ice sheets were you know not disappearing
[01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:33.200]  they've actually gotten bigger and a lot of other big victories and this is the
[01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:38.000]  big globalist push to control and track and tax everything on earth while
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:41.280]  ignoring real environmental crises so I wanted to get him on because his big
[01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:45.800]  peer-reviewed paper has come out as being attacked and demonized right now but
[01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:48.320]  I don't want to spend too much time on that because these people are so
[01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:52.320]  discredited you know whatever but it's important I also want to get his take on
[01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:56.720]  geopolitical movement so if you'll do this I'll throw a curveball at him a
[01:25:56.720 --> 01:26:01.440]  wild card in the short segment the next long segment he can have the floor in
[01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:08.480]  the main what do you make a BB speech to Congress what do you make of this Western
[01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:13.800]  alliance with al-Qaeda calling itself ISIS to bring down Assad now blowing back
[01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:18.120]  so we ally with Iran and Israel saying they may you know basically going and
[01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:22.960]  blow up those reactors and then Russia and I mean everything seems to be going
[01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:26.680]  into high gear Obama is saying he may raise taxes
[01:26:26.680 --> 01:26:31.600]  executively that is dictatorship he's banning bullets with executive action
[01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:37.120]  that they is totally illegal he's federalizing police everything's moving
[01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:40.600]  in high gear is there a reason geopolitically this is happening because
[01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:44.440]  it seems in other Western nations things are moving quickly what's going on
[01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:49.200]  Lord Monk in your view okay two questions first of all let's deal with
[01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:54.680]  Obama and what he's up to there in the United States in Washington now what
[01:26:54.680 --> 01:26:58.920]  he's doing is he's realized he's lost control of Congress he knows he's no
[01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:04.040]  longer in charge of that so what he's doing is he's saying right what I'm
[01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:09.920]  going to do is I'm going to just make law up as I go along and use the procedure
[01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:13.280]  known as the executive order where I just write a piece of paper saying this is
[01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:19.520]  what I want and that then becomes the law now Congress ought to wake up and
[01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:26.080]  realize that in fact he doesn't have the power to do this because article one
[01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:31.480]  section one of your constitution quite clear it says that no law can be passed
[01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:36.680]  by anyone unless it's passed by Congress nobody else has any legislative power on
[01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:43.440]  their own at all so he can't use that the function of Congress unless Congress
[01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:47.660]  lets him away with it and the Republicans need to sharpen their game and
[01:27:47.660 --> 01:27:50.600]  start saying no we're not going to let the EPA make up rules we're not going to
[01:27:50.600 --> 01:27:55.160]  allow Obama to make up rules randomly it has to come before Congress or it
[01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:59.400]  isn't a law so that's that one he's acting as every dictator always does
[01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:03.320]  making up the law when he can't get it through his parliament now as far as
[01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:07.200]  BB Netanyahu is concerned whom I know because I met him in Israel many years
[01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:13.320]  ago and I went there as a guess the government what he is really saying in
[01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:18.080]  that speech is a cry for help he's saying look this is going to hell in a
[01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:23.400]  handcart because effectively the West has found itself taking sides over and
[01:28:23.400 --> 01:28:29.520]  over again with one Muslim faction against another and then in no time at
[01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:32.960]  all it finds itself fighting on the opposite side and all the time it is
[01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:38.880]  feeding Western weapons in two groups which eventually become terrorist
[01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:42.960]  groups fighting against the West and it's time that this nonsense stopped now
[01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:48.960]  of course he's also very worried indeed about the various nuclear research is
[01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:54.880]  going on in Iran which are clearly not intended so much for civilian use as
[01:28:54.880 --> 01:29:01.480]  for weaponizing the plutonium to make bombs with and he is not going to allow
[01:29:01.480 --> 01:29:05.920]  that to happen and he's made that very plain after all it was Israel who
[01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:11.840]  previously knocked out the Osirak reactor in Iraq when it too was working
[01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:18.680]  towards weaponizing nuclear material so he is saying if you won't do your job
[01:29:18.680 --> 01:29:23.280]  because Obama effectively has abdicated in that region he is too close to the
[01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:29.360]  Muslim side of things to be trustworthy as far as BB Netanyahu is concerned so
[01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:36.800]  Netanyahu is saying I'm going to have to act unilaterally unless you decide that
[01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:41.640]  you're going to sharpen up your act and find a more solid coherent policy for
[01:29:41.640 --> 01:29:44.200]  dealing with them. All right Lord Mock, stay there and come back and finish that

[01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:53.520]  cover they say we never went to the moon and then next they say in the war on
[01:33:53.520 --> 01:34:00.640]  science that climate change isn't real what a nice bait and switch we always
[01:34:00.640 --> 01:34:06.600]  said Moncton for 20 plus years that it is climate change that it's normal that
[01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:12.840]  change is the only constant because of the sun and other factors the solar
[01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:17.840]  winds the list goes on and on and that's what the science shows but they get up
[01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:20.760]  there in line say the science is in everyone agrees global warming
[01:34:20.760 --> 01:34:25.840]  anthropogenic man-made now the last three four years they've segwayed into

[01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:46.560]  all basically dead because it's freezing here it's the sun the sun
[01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:49.960]  started to cool off years ago Lord Moncton by an astrophysicist on you name
[01:34:49.960 --> 01:34:54.120]  it oh just Lord Moncton they said get ready for it to get cold it ready for
[01:34:54.120 --> 01:35:01.480]  the ice caps on Mars to get big again when I had David Rothschild on years
[01:35:01.480 --> 01:35:05.920]  ago I said why are the ice caps then those on the earth was still heating a
[01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:10.560]  little bit about eight nine years ago go why are the ice caps getting smaller on
[01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:14.360]  Mars too he said well that's because Mars is closer to the Sun than Earth and I
[01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:19.400]  said no it's the fourth planet we're the third he said no it's not sorry and I
[01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:22.560]  said are you doing that to be insult my audience or you think we're that dumb
[01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:27.280]  he's just started laughing at me we've played the clip of that many times it's
[01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:32.200]  in my film in game Lord Moncton they seem to be tripling down now as
[01:35:32.200 --> 01:35:35.960]  everything collapses on them and then trying to discredit you and others
[01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:39.760]  finish up with any geopolitical news and then let's get into that subject
[01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:44.720]  place all right very briefly then on BB Netanyahu speech and this is a very
[01:35:44.720 --> 01:35:49.800]  important speech it was extremely well received in Congress many many standing
[01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:56.160]  ovations a lot of excitement about it and I think this is a very important and
[01:35:56.160 --> 01:36:02.760]  very significant moment because Congress has decided to act unilaterally here in
[01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:08.440]  a way it hasn't done hadn't found the courage to do so far it invited BB Netanyahu
[01:36:08.440 --> 01:36:13.040]  when Obama didn't Obama didn't ask him to come but Congress asked him to come
[01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:18.040]  because they are concerned that he simply doesn't have a handle on the Middle
[01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:22.800]  East situation which of course stems originally from the situation of
[01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:27.120]  Palestine it's really Britain's fault originally because it was we who decided
[01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:32.040]  when we had the mandate to control that territory eventually to give it to
[01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:37.160]  Israel when there were still a million Palestinians living in it and that has
[01:36:37.160 --> 01:36:40.920]  led to conflict ever since now it's very clear what's got to happen there needs
[01:36:40.920 --> 01:36:45.240]  to be a generous financial settlement to those who can demonstrate that they are
[01:36:45.240 --> 01:36:48.920]  legitimate descendants of the original Palestinians who were dispossessed by
[01:36:48.920 --> 01:36:52.480]  the creation of the state of Israel that would leave Israel in place but the
[01:36:52.480 --> 01:36:58.280]  Palestinians properly compensated but they would have to accept as the price of
[01:36:58.280 --> 01:37:02.960]  that compensation that they acknowledge Israel's continuing right to exist and
[01:37:02.960 --> 01:37:07.840]  will no longer seek to do it down now that's the kind of policy that I think
[01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:10.640]  we're going to need to see and it's actually Western countries that are
[01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:14.360]  going to have to pay for that because it isn't Israel's fault that Israel it's
[01:37:14.360 --> 01:37:19.000]  there it's our fault that Israel is there and so we should compensate the
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:22.960]  Palestinians for what they have had to endure the taking away of their territory
[01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:26.800]  to create Israel this is a problem for Palestine we have to understand that
[01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:31.400]  but at the same time Israel after what was done to it in the before the Second
[01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:36.280]  World War by Hitler Israel also has its right to exist as a nation and that way
[01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:42.200]  you can get both nations a coexisting I hope in harmony something like that has
[01:37:42.200 --> 01:37:47.280]  got to be tried because otherwise the conflict between the West and the
[01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:51.760]  Islamic world which has largely stemmed out of the Palestinian conflict is not
[01:37:51.760 --> 01:37:56.960]  going to go away and it is I'm afraid going to get worse and I'm very sorry
[01:37:56.960 --> 01:38:02.040]  about that because my late father spoke Arabic looked quite Arabic in some
[01:38:02.040 --> 01:38:07.760]  ways knew many of the leading figures in the Arab world and was very fond of it
[01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:13.960]  and so am I and it's a great sadness to see this really unnecessary
[01:38:13.960 --> 01:38:18.520]  disturbance of the former harmony there and the savage treatment in
[01:38:18.520 --> 01:38:22.600]  particular of the Christians in Syria at the moment and and other places in the
[01:38:22.600 --> 01:38:27.600]  region where hundreds of thousands have been dispossessed or killed and
[01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:32.520]  virtually nothing said in the fashionable left-wing press well that's why
[01:38:32.520 --> 01:38:37.200]  BB Netanyahu is being received so well in Congress because he is speaking to
[01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:40.240]  these issues which the present administration in the United States
[01:38:40.240 --> 01:38:44.240]  have nothing to say about it in closing on the subject why won't the feminist
[01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:48.520]  that say a man wearing pants hurts women or that all sex between a man and a
[01:38:48.520 --> 01:38:53.560]  woman is rape literally why aren't they upset when radical Islamists sexually
[01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:57.960]  mutilate women or cut their heads off or kill Christians or put little girls in
[01:38:57.960 --> 01:39:03.360]  a sex slavery why would the left is radical Islam so sexy and chic if you
[01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:07.160]  go to a leftist meeting there are folks there just fawning after it it's so
[01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:14.160]  sexy to be in a jihad slave pit this is always been the way that the media and
[01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:20.880]  the left are by instinct not democratic but totalitarian and totalitarians will
[01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:24.960]  always tend to stand together and think as one and of course there's the
[01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:30.360]  additional factor that Obama has been letting very large numbers of Muslims
[01:39:30.360 --> 01:39:35.880]  into the United States and this is because the first few generations of
[01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:40.760]  immigrants from wherever they come tend to vote left and so the left always have
[01:39:40.760 --> 01:39:44.360]  policies which seem terribly tough against immigration but in fact you always
[01:39:44.360 --> 01:39:47.320]  get very very large numbers of people coming in and in particular at the
[01:39:47.320 --> 01:39:52.080]  moment from the Muslim world into the United States changing forever as they
[01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:58.000]  hope the terms of trade in voting to make sure that we never really ever get a
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:02.080]  republican government again that's the aim of it it's the constant movement
[01:40:02.080 --> 01:40:07.920]  leftward and that's why the left makes common cause with the terrorists and the
[01:40:07.920 --> 01:40:12.600]  extremists of Islam rather than doing what the center right does which is
[01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:15.120]  saying actually that sort of conduct is unacceptable
[01:40:15.120 --> 01:40:21.400]  all right Lord Moncton good analysis on that front let's segue into the latest
[01:40:21.400 --> 01:40:26.000]  on the carbon taxing how they're responding to record cold temperatures
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:30.800]  record-thick ice sheets record numbers of polar bears and penguinos what's
[01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:35.600]  happening on that front well let's first of all you're quite right about this
[01:40:35.600 --> 01:40:39.160]  there are seven times as many polar bears and that's the way in the 1940s
[01:40:39.160 --> 01:40:42.800]  hardly as you may think the profile of a species imminent threat of extinction
[01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:46.760]  and yet the worldwide fund for nature so-called is another communist front
[01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:52.280]  group has put out a an advertisement in the United Kingdom which doesn't appear
[01:40:52.280 --> 01:40:55.440]  on their website because they don't want people actually getting the text of it
[01:40:55.440 --> 01:40:58.720]  and then making complaints about it which says that polar bear numbers are in
[01:40:58.720 --> 01:41:03.280]  decline well they're not that they're growing very rapidly because the Arctic
[01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:07.640]  it has been a little bit less warm than it had there's been a little bit of a
[01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:10.720]  loss of ice there but it's been more than matched by gain of ice and the
[01:41:10.720 --> 01:41:15.840]  Antarctic and overall just a few months ago for the time of year there was more
[01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:21.720]  sea ice globally than had ever been measured in 35 years of the satellite
[01:41:21.720 --> 01:41:26.160]  coverage you will not see that in any mainstream news meeting we'll only see it
[01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:30.960]  on Alex Jones but the fight back is now even beginning among the scientific
[01:41:30.960 --> 01:41:36.440]  community the paper that I entered three distinguished colleagues professor David
[01:41:36.440 --> 01:41:43.040]  Ligate Dr. Willie soon and Dr. Matt Briggs published in January in the
[01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:48.320]  Chinese science bulletin is the most popular paper in terms of the number
[01:41:48.320 --> 01:41:52.600]  of downloads that that distinguished journalists the oriental equivalent of
[01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:59.040]  science or nature has had for any scientific paper published in the last
[01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:05.920]  60 years of its archive in fact it's had more downloads than the others by just
[01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:10.160]  about 10 times over this has proved to be very popular paper because it's
[01:42:10.160 --> 01:42:15.760]  actually quite a simple paper what it does is to set out an irreducibly simple
[01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:21.880]  climate model which is a way of looking at the climate and what you can see in
[01:42:21.880 --> 01:42:28.160]  the paper is that when we ran that model for the first time the answer it gave
[01:42:28.160 --> 01:42:33.000]  was exactly the rate of warming that we've in fact seen over the last 30
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:37.160]  years whereas the official models are predicting twice as much warming as has
[01:42:37.160 --> 01:42:42.680]  actually occurred now this paper is a phenomenon it's of great concern to those
[01:42:42.680 --> 01:42:47.160]  who are trying to say at the UN's climate conference in December in Paris
[01:42:47.160 --> 01:42:50.880]  where they hope to inflict a world government treaty on us the one they
[01:42:50.880 --> 01:42:55.400]  they failed to do at Copenhagen they're going to try again the Chinese blocked
[01:42:55.400 --> 01:43:00.400]  the Copenhagen one the Chinese have been squared by as of course Obama this
[01:43:00.400 --> 01:43:04.640]  time he went over there and said look please don't wreck the treaty this time
[01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:09.560]  we'll let you out of it you can go on emitting as much CO2 as you like right
[01:43:09.560 --> 01:43:12.600]  they never comply with any of it they can build all the new plants they want
[01:43:12.600 --> 01:43:16.600]  Pachari can and India even though he just lost his position we can talk about
[01:43:16.600 --> 01:43:22.040]  that it's only on the west that these cuts are made that is absolutely right
[01:43:22.040 --> 01:43:25.400]  and what is interesting is that the China has been given a specific exemption
[01:43:25.400 --> 01:43:29.440]  so it doesn't have to cut its emissions at all now the point about that is that
[01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:34.400]  China is now far and away the largest emitter of CO2 on the planet so if CO2
[01:43:34.400 --> 01:43:38.200]  were a problem and you're wanting to control it the one country you wouldn't
[01:43:38.200 --> 01:43:41.920]  let out of this agreement is China and the other one that you've just mentioned
[01:43:41.920 --> 01:43:44.920]  that you wouldn't let out is the second largest emitter or soon will be and
[01:43:44.920 --> 01:43:49.920]  that's India and so what they've really said is in order to get some sort of a
[01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:54.080]  treaty through they're going to have to exempt the people who are now the major
[01:43:54.080 --> 01:43:57.560]  contributors to the CO2 in the atmosphere that's how Dottie it has all
[01:43:57.560 --> 01:44:02.240]  become but the reason why they're pushing for this desperately pushing for
[01:44:02.240 --> 01:44:06.320]  this treaty is they now know the science has collapsed our paper among others
[01:44:06.320 --> 01:44:11.280]  tells them it's collapsed but they can't admit it and their only way of not
[01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:16.280]  being shown up as having got it as badly wrong as they did is actually to bring
[01:44:16.280 --> 01:44:21.000]  CO2 concentration down to zero so that when as they now know it would anyway
[01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:25.320]  the temperature fails to rise they can say they did that with their heroic
[01:44:25.320 --> 01:44:30.120]  cuts in CO2 rather than it wasn't going to happen anyway but of course this paper
[01:44:30.120 --> 01:44:35.440]  has provoked outrage and screaming fury on the left at first they tried to poo
[01:44:35.440 --> 01:44:38.760]  poo it saying that the journal it was in was insignificant and they discovered it
[01:44:38.760 --> 01:44:42.480]  is the Journal of the Chinese Academy of Sciences the largest such thing in the
[01:44:42.480 --> 01:44:47.120]  world then they tried various very dopey attacks on the science which fell
[01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:50.760]  completely flat because most of them are plainly not even read the paper so then
[01:44:50.760 --> 01:44:56.360]  when all that had failed they decided to attack Dr. Willie soon who is my very
[01:44:56.360 --> 01:45:02.320]  distinguished co-author of this paper who's been an astrophysicist at the
[01:45:02.320 --> 01:45:06.520]  Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics for the last 25 years and
[01:45:06.520 --> 01:45:12.760]  they had the New York Times the Washington Post the Boston Globe all the left-wing
[01:45:12.760 --> 01:45:18.560]  mainstream media wrote lying pieces saying that he had a conflict of interest
[01:45:18.560 --> 01:45:23.000]  in that he should have declared he was funded by fossil fuel interests when
[01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:28.640]  writing our paper well he has as many scientists have had funding both from
[01:45:28.640 --> 01:45:32.840]  governments and from fossil fuel interest in the past however at present at
[01:45:32.840 --> 01:45:37.160]  the time he worked on our paper he wasn't being funded by anyone but let me
[01:45:37.160 --> 01:45:40.840]  interrupt you for a moment please because I follow this and we always defend
[01:45:40.840 --> 01:45:44.720]  ourselves I've never gotten a fossil fuel company money but I also follow the
[01:45:44.720 --> 01:45:50.400]  news for 23 years 20 years on air most the big oil companies like Dutch
[01:45:50.400 --> 01:45:54.440]  Royal Shell and BP are some of the biggest funders of climate change
[01:45:54.440 --> 01:46:00.000]  baloney Exxon Mobil eight years ago Rex Tillerson was put on notice it was in
[01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:04.000]  the news that he would get behind it by David Rockefeller or be removed at the
[01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.840]  board meeting because David came and exercised the fact that he was the
[01:46:06.840 --> 01:46:11.760]  majority owner of it since it was busted up with the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1906
[01:46:11.760 --> 01:46:17.920]  and so the that raises ugly head the robber Baron money and the fact that
[01:46:17.920 --> 01:46:21.960]  if there's the headline fossil fuel industry caught taking a page out of the
[01:46:21.960 --> 01:46:27.040]  tobacco playbook so they're they're spinning it that that it's the fossil
[01:46:27.040 --> 01:46:31.320]  fuel companies doing this when when when you could go into any university and
[01:46:31.320 --> 01:46:34.360]  find a department where something's going to be funded by one of these
[01:46:34.360 --> 01:46:39.000]  industries and that supposedly discredits it the truth is you look at the
[01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:43.080]  hide-the-decline people and you look at climate gain you look at Pichari and all
[01:46:43.080 --> 01:46:47.520]  these players and Al Gore owning one of the climate exchanges and Obama
[01:46:47.520 --> 01:46:52.600]  invested in the Chicago exchange I mean it's a total joke they are the most
[01:46:52.600 --> 01:46:57.560]  conflicted group of anybody and I'm just sick of the red herring that's all
[01:46:57.560 --> 01:47:01.040]  they've got is all scientists agree with us and when you show that most don't
[01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:05.920]  they go well you're all paid off by oil companies it's just insane it is it is
[01:47:05.920 --> 01:47:11.040]  it is completely outrageous something like I think it's five thousand times
[01:47:11.040 --> 01:47:17.160]  as much funding goes to true believers in firm again this new religion than to
[01:47:17.160 --> 01:47:20.800]  those of us who are skeptical I mean nothing comes to me at all I very
[01:47:20.800 --> 01:47:25.280]  occasionally get a speaker fee here and there but nobody pays me to do my
[01:47:25.280 --> 01:47:28.960]  research into the climate I'm always being asked that the left are always
[01:47:28.960 --> 01:47:32.280]  trying to catch man saying who's paying you are they allowed to be paid but then
[01:47:32.280 --> 01:47:38.000]  you are I think it's because governments have decided for various reasons of
[01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:42.840]  extending their own power and reach and getting more taxation and and regulatory
[01:47:42.840 --> 01:47:47.520]  power that they want to back this story whether it's true or not I've had this
[01:47:47.520 --> 01:47:50.520]  from several members of the Conservative Party in Britain which is the ruling
[01:47:50.520 --> 01:47:55.640]  party here they know perfectly well it's rubbish but they also find it very
[01:47:55.640 --> 01:47:59.480]  convenient as a way of keeping the taxpayer in his place so there's a
[01:47:59.480 --> 01:48:04.240]  large element of some totalitarian suppression of freedom and transfer of
[01:48:04.240 --> 01:48:08.880]  wealth from the little guy to the be sure it's a giant power grab but I mean
[01:48:08.880 --> 01:48:12.280]  isn't this good that they're forced to look at your paper doesn't this show
[01:48:12.280 --> 01:48:15.480]  you're having a big effect that they're trying to discredit I think the fact is
[01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:21.120]  they are furious because what I've done is I've said look you can have a simple
[01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:25.920]  climate model so simple you can run it on a pocket calculator and that model
[01:48:25.920 --> 01:48:30.480]  shows we're not going to get all that much warming now what what worries them
[01:48:30.480 --> 01:48:35.080]  about that is that if I proven if I'm proven to be right then a lot of very
[01:48:35.080 --> 01:48:39.120]  searching questions are going to be asked in 30 or 40 years time about why so
[01:48:39.120 --> 01:48:43.800]  many trillions were spent on the basis of these huge climate models that simply
[01:48:43.800 --> 01:48:46.760]  got it wrong and if you want to see this paper for yourself because it's a
[01:48:46.760 --> 01:48:50.200]  Lulu there's not a very good material in it as you can see it's flashing on the
[01:48:50.200 --> 01:48:56.920]  screen now you can go to SCI BULL.com Cybull.com
[01:48:56.920 --> 01:49:02.080]  other unfortunate moniker for their website and then just click on most red
[01:49:02.080 --> 01:49:06.600]  articles and we are number one on the list and please do that because the more
[01:49:06.600 --> 01:49:12.400]  people download this paper the more the left will take note that no longer are
[01:49:12.400 --> 01:49:16.760]  we sitting back and just letting them control the journals we are getting in
[01:49:16.760 --> 01:49:22.000]  to of course the left have been furious at the science bulletin for running this
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:25.120]  there's been a lot of complaints about Willie soon having not declared his
[01:49:25.120 --> 01:49:29.120]  conflict of interest but I wrote to the editors and said look this is a risen and
[01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:34.040]  here is the answer none of us was paid a single cent to do months of work you
[01:49:34.040 --> 01:49:37.680]  know scientific papers not an easy thing to do it takes a lot of work to put it
[01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:44.000]  together we were not paid a single cent by anyone to do that so the editor very
[01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:47.500]  kindly accepted that and has been sending my letter out to all the
[01:49:47.500 --> 01:49:50.640]  complainers saying well look actually there isn't any money that changed hands
[01:49:50.640 --> 01:49:54.640]  here and it's a perfectly good straightforward paper so why that's just
[01:49:54.640 --> 01:49:57.760]  like when Brian Williams gets just credited they changed the subject to
[01:49:57.760 --> 01:50:00.880]  Bill O'Reilly and I'm not defending Bill O'Reilly he's even promoted this
[01:50:00.880 --> 01:50:04.200]  nonsense the point is they want to change the subject by demonizing
[01:50:04.200 --> 01:50:08.040]  somebody to get the attention off of them when the fact that the ice sheets are
[01:50:08.040 --> 01:50:12.880]  getting bigger and it's so cold people know this is bull then they learn that

[01:57:31.120 --> 01:57:36.600]  point out that on barring the political inclinations of the speech today I
[01:57:36.600 --> 01:57:43.920]  think he gave Congress some insight into what he's actually dealing with in the
[01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:52.440]  region we're not there but he is and defending his people is probably a very
[01:57:52.440 --> 01:57:57.960]  high priority barring any evilness in the government and the government across
[01:57:57.960 --> 01:58:03.360]  the world I mean that's just my opinion and looking at the six days war after
[01:58:03.360 --> 01:58:11.520]  they established their state I mean to my eyes that was just a godsend I mean
[01:58:11.520 --> 01:58:17.960]  God induced you're talking about prominence yes most definitely I mean
[01:58:17.960 --> 01:58:24.640]  they were surrounded then and look what they accomplished by themselves so that's
[01:58:24.640 --> 01:58:30.200]  what I think. Well that's right and and you know that's why people say you know
[01:58:30.200 --> 01:58:33.640]  go in and take over Israel hand over to people it's not gonna happen they have

[02:01:15.680 --> 02:01:25.120]  years ago but from 1949 KGB have plans to destroy Israel and then defended
[02:01:25.120 --> 02:01:29.480]  lots of weapons lots of health instructors to muscle work including
[02:01:29.480 --> 02:01:37.200]  Iran Iraq or other countries so in the plans from 49 this day still plan to
[02:01:37.200 --> 02:01:43.320]  destroy Israel because they needed to so Mitanyahu will talk to Congress
[02:01:43.320 --> 02:01:48.840]  Congress will listen and do what they want to do but Mitanyahu will try to
[02:01:48.840 --> 02:01:54.640]  fight against it only option they have like you said before nuclear weapon each
[02:01:54.640 --> 02:02:01.720]  time sorry which a muscle war don't have it yet around but they have a Iran
[02:02:01.720 --> 02:02:08.560]  reactor which can be used exactly to produce it which exactly exist in
[02:02:08.560 --> 02:02:12.840]  this moment but it's not sure and I wasn't trying to be smart mouth earlier
[02:02:12.840 --> 02:02:16.640]  sometimes callers can't hear me so I I'll ask them a question to see if they
[02:02:16.640 --> 02:02:19.520]  can hear me sorry there was interference in the line very interesting so you were
[02:02:19.520 --> 02:02:26.400]  in the KGB what was your rank in the KGB attempt and then did you defect to the
[02:02:26.400 --> 02:02:34.120]  U.S. yes I'm an U.S. more than 20 years Wow well I mean I know that Russia did
[02:02:34.120 --> 02:02:39.600]  fund anti-Israel operations what is your view of the geopolitical movements
[02:02:39.600 --> 02:02:47.560]  today they need to see Israel or it's gonna fall and it's gonna be big war
[02:02:47.560 --> 02:02:53.600]  because plans of Russia and plans of us now it's not connected before United
[02:02:53.600 --> 02:02:58.120]  States will support Israel Russia was against it now
[02:02:58.120 --> 02:03:02.800]  America not supported Israel it's mean it's gonna fall in gonna be fight in a
[02:03:02.800 --> 02:03:09.160]  fight to be big I agree with that statement if even if you hate Israel but

[02:03:13.400 --> 02:03:17.560]  3 will start I mean you can't get rid of Israel and I guess biblically it's what
[02:03:17.560 --> 02:03:23.800]  causes the end of the world I guess technically realistically yes it is
[02:03:23.800 --> 02:03:31.840]  if Mohammed church in Palestine they'll be fall and they're gonna build Israel
[02:03:31.840 --> 02:03:37.240]  church and it's exactly will be getting my Bible World War 3 and exactly what

[02:03:42.080 --> 02:03:46.280]  question if you were in the security services or the KGB which I don't doubt

[02:08:53.440 --> 02:08:58.880]  there's so many different conflicting forces in this world so many different
[02:08:58.880 --> 02:09:03.480]  inputs the forces of liberty the forces of tyranny the forces of greed the
[02:09:03.480 --> 02:09:09.680]  forces of laziness the forces of ignorance the forces of enlightenment
[02:09:09.680 --> 02:09:14.360]  sometimes these forces run head-on sometimes they run side-to-side sometimes
[02:09:14.360 --> 02:09:21.080]  they twist and turn but in this universe good can have an effect and I see out
[02:09:21.080 --> 02:09:25.720]  of the establishment corporations and most governments a push to make a stupid
[02:09:25.720 --> 02:09:30.480]  dumb us down and suppress our soul suppress our spirits because free
[02:09:30.480 --> 02:09:36.200]  spirits spirits that love God and justice will not resonate with this
[02:09:36.200 --> 02:09:40.680]  anti-human world government 20 years ago I talked about the transhumanist
[02:09:40.680 --> 02:09:43.800]  coming out of the eugenicist movement and their plan to establish a planetary
[02:09:43.800 --> 02:09:50.680]  world government merged with machines and basically in humanity as we know it
[02:09:50.680 --> 02:09:55.280]  no one was talking about it back then but the establishment in somewhat
[02:09:55.280 --> 02:10:02.360]  restricted publications now it is all over the news pretty much every single
[02:10:02.360 --> 02:10:09.440]  day to a mind-blowing level you go to the front page of info wars.com we have
[02:10:09.440 --> 02:10:13.600]  a graphic with a famous quote by Ray Kurzweil one of his books he's one of
[02:10:13.600 --> 02:10:19.840]  the top google executives by the year 2030 the non biological portion of our
[02:10:19.840 --> 02:10:28.120]  intelligence will predominate now whether that's true or not the move is
[02:10:28.120 --> 02:10:32.640]  being made it's been decided he goes on to say if you don't want to merge with
[02:10:32.640 --> 02:10:36.120]  the machines that's fine but you'll be like a bug compared to intelligence
[02:10:36.120 --> 02:10:42.200]  well the best laid plans of mice and men often to arise I like to quote of
[02:10:42.200 --> 02:10:52.720]  mice and men well mice and men quotes the poem but the the much of what the
[02:10:52.720 --> 02:10:57.160]  globalist are planning and trying to do they're not successful in they just
[02:10:57.160 --> 02:11:02.040]  regage things change their program a bit and then keep crying so overall they're
[02:11:02.040 --> 02:11:07.680]  very successful because they don't ever give up almost every time we even
[02:11:07.680 --> 02:11:14.240]  rally a fraction of people worldwide to fight tyranny we win the problem is so
[02:11:14.240 --> 02:11:18.840]  many people are awake they think they don't have any power so it's a stupid
[02:11:18.840 --> 02:11:23.400]  for Arabs and Jews to be fighting and Christians and Muslims black white all
[02:11:23.400 --> 02:11:29.400]  this when the globalist are scientific dictators they call themselves
[02:11:29.400 --> 02:11:33.640]  technocrats in Europe they're appointing the leaders of major countries all
[02:11:33.640 --> 02:11:41.080]  Goldman Sachs executives Obama is acting as a dictator that's not a word
[02:11:41.080 --> 02:11:45.280]  that's a reality he says he's gonna raise taxes with executive orders that's in
[02:11:45.280 --> 02:11:49.160]  town hall today they're announcing look at this headline by Kit Daniels great
[02:11:49.160 --> 02:11:53.280]  article not hardcore enough Obama to expand federal control over state local
[02:11:53.280 --> 02:12:01.640]  police Obama announces new power grab moves to federalize police is is is I
[02:12:01.640 --> 02:12:04.800]  mean because sometimes stuff so sensational you just can't have a
[02:12:04.800 --> 02:12:10.000]  professional headline because it doesn't grasp how serious it is Obama to
[02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:14.840]  expand federal control over state local police Obama accelerates power grab
[02:12:14.840 --> 02:12:21.800]  moves to federalize police red alert but leave the headline like it is I mean
[02:12:21.800 --> 02:12:28.200]  it's just it's just the power plants the guns the bullets the the borders the
[02:12:28.200 --> 02:12:34.080]  military the the funding ISIS he's just doing it all without Congress without
[02:12:34.080 --> 02:12:39.160]  the states or anything and I got to tell you I heard people in Obama's first
[02:12:39.160 --> 02:12:43.440]  running for office saying oh he's gonna be horrible he's gonna take over and I'm
[02:12:43.440 --> 02:12:47.440]  like it's not that bad well the Republican leadership's going along with
[02:12:47.440 --> 02:12:50.480]  all this so it is that bad and I don't know how it's gonna end the next two
[02:12:50.480 --> 02:12:53.720]  years there's a little under two years left to this the Republicans are
[02:12:53.720 --> 02:12:57.800]  signing off on his FCC power grab they're like oh we won't challenge it go
[02:12:57.800 --> 02:13:01.120]  ahead let the FCC just grab it oh we're not gonna challenge you on the
[02:13:01.120 --> 02:13:04.080]  borders we're not gonna challenge you on the military on the power plants on the
[02:13:04.080 --> 02:13:11.320]  executive orders on the taxes on Obamacare because the very same special
[02:13:11.320 --> 02:13:18.320]  interests are in control this president the Republican leadership and I don't
[02:13:18.320 --> 02:13:22.440]  know where the world goes from here because it's getting so transparent
[02:13:22.440 --> 02:13:28.320]  Joel Gilbert is a best-selling documentary filmmaker his latest film
[02:13:28.320 --> 02:13:33.080]  utopia exposing the fact that it's not a utopia that they're building is
[02:13:33.080 --> 02:13:37.320]  available at info or store.com I should add that and basically gets into the
[02:13:37.320 --> 02:13:42.920]  whole socialist journey when people have gone through in this country utopia
[02:13:42.920 --> 02:13:48.840]  there's no place like utopia is the full name of the film but he's not here so
[02:13:48.840 --> 02:13:52.400]  much talk about that today need to get the film and give it to young people
[02:13:52.400 --> 02:13:55.440]  and others folks that's how we win hearts and minds you can unlock somebody's
[02:13:55.440 --> 02:13:58.640]  mind with one piece of truth it can dislodge an entire mountain of
[02:13:58.640 --> 02:14:05.280]  disinformation and fraudulent propaganda I wanted to get Gilbert on because it
[02:14:05.280 --> 02:14:08.880]  was a little week or so ago remember a Congress pointed out that his connection
[02:14:08.880 --> 02:14:13.600]  to who we believe is Obama's real father Frank Marshall Davis and more and more
[02:14:13.600 --> 02:14:17.120]  of what's in Gilbert's film we're seeing in mainstream here and there almost like
[02:14:17.120 --> 02:14:21.040]  the power structures dangling it out there in these kind of wars we know
[02:14:21.040 --> 02:14:23.800]  there's even wars in the establishment you're hearing criminal stuff about
[02:14:23.800 --> 02:14:28.320]  Hillary and her illegal emails and Jeb Bush and illegal Nigeria stuff lying to
[02:14:28.320 --> 02:14:34.160]  the FBI not declaring income so so so there's in finally in the system as
[02:14:34.160 --> 02:14:37.720]  well but I'm seeing a lot of that starting to come out right now then
[02:14:37.720 --> 02:14:42.880]  you've got all these announcements and you've got world government being pushed
[02:14:42.880 --> 02:14:50.720]  and transhumanism and smartphone spying on you and all the rest of it and
[02:14:50.720 --> 02:14:55.840]  meanwhile you got George Soros running around spending $33 million to cause
[02:14:55.840 --> 02:14:59.640]  basically anti-police riots around the country to destabilize the nation so
[02:14:59.640 --> 02:15:02.960]  Obama composes a savior and come in and federalize police which they're now
[02:15:02.960 --> 02:15:07.560]  announcing we predicted this so what's the next shoe to drop their power
[02:15:07.560 --> 02:15:12.440]  grabbing everything the internet the borders the police Joel Gilbert what
[02:15:12.440 --> 02:15:15.680]  do you think's going on you're a big Obama expert you've traveled the world
[02:15:15.680 --> 02:15:19.440]  attract this guy what do you think's going on Joel Gilbert well I think
[02:15:19.440 --> 02:15:25.880]  there's an actual roadmap that Obama is following from his mentor Bill Ayers and
[02:15:25.880 --> 02:15:29.560]  of course Bernadine Dorn in the weather underground from the late 60s they wrote
[02:15:29.560 --> 02:15:35.120]  a document called prairie fire and the essence of that was using a line from
[02:15:35.120 --> 02:15:41.160]  Mount Cetung which was a single spark can start a prairie fire meaning one
[02:15:41.160 --> 02:15:46.560]  incident one agitation can start an entire revolution and you see Obama
[02:15:46.560 --> 02:15:53.040]  agitating prairie fires such as he did in Ferguson the Trayvon Martin case you
[02:15:53.040 --> 02:15:57.800]  tried on the guns up in Newton, Massachusetts he's always agitating
[02:15:57.800 --> 02:16:01.960]  he's a professional agitator he was trained as an agitator in Chicago at
[02:16:01.960 --> 02:16:07.360]  the Midwest Academy he was a trainer for Acorn and I think he had no interest
[02:16:07.360 --> 02:16:11.080]  ever in becoming president of the United States or in being president his only
[02:16:11.080 --> 02:16:15.640]  interest was using the pulpit of the presidency to agitate the country and
[02:16:15.640 --> 02:16:22.960]  divide and polarize the nation it is only about 50 years ago now that 45 years
[02:16:22.960 --> 02:16:26.800]  ago that Bernadine Dorn in the weather underground declared war on the United
[02:16:26.800 --> 02:16:31.200]  States and I think when you look at Obama's policies the last few years his
[02:16:31.200 --> 02:16:36.000]  agenda for the next two years I think it is open warfare against the United
[02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:42.360]  States to degrade and harm and eliminate the foundations of the Constitution
[02:16:42.360 --> 02:16:46.440]  you're right and it's like it's it's some type of weird Bell and Ted's
[02:16:46.440 --> 02:16:49.840]  excellent adventure where they're caught in a time loop because they're using an
[02:16:49.840 --> 02:16:54.640]  old Soviet playbook to bring down the US and Israel and Western Europe long
[02:16:54.640 --> 02:16:59.760]  after all that collapsed these are crazy people I mean they're in control right
[02:16:59.760 --> 02:17:03.920]  now and they're trying to shut off the industrial base and start a civil war
[02:17:03.920 --> 02:17:08.000]  these people are mentally ill well the way they accomplished it is based on a
[02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:12.800]  learning curve Bill Ayers and Obama's mentors in the weather underground would
[02:17:12.800 --> 02:17:17.520]  look people in the eye in the late 60s and they would say we want to destroy you
[02:17:17.520 --> 02:17:22.440]  we want to bring down America replace the Constitution with a communist
[02:17:22.440 --> 02:17:27.480]  manifesto we want to send 50 million of you to reeducation centers and murder
[02:17:27.480 --> 02:17:31.000]  25 million of you and have the UN basically occupy the US with
[02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:34.240]  international forces correct you they wanted to occupy the United States with
[02:17:34.240 --> 02:17:40.120]  Soviet Chinese North Vietnamese North Korean and Vietnamese forces they
[02:17:40.120 --> 02:17:44.960]  nobody followed them because it turned people off because it was so evil they
[02:17:44.960 --> 02:17:48.680]  ended up going to jail for murdering policemen they went into the
[02:17:48.680 --> 02:17:52.880]  underground for 10 15 years when they emerged from the underground the early
[02:17:52.880 --> 02:17:59.320]  80s in Chicago and became Barack Obama's mentors they taught him the lesson
[02:17:59.320 --> 02:18:03.360]  the lesson was instead of looking people in the eye and saying we want to murder
[02:18:03.360 --> 02:18:09.160]  you look at them in the eye and say we want fairness we want to help you and
[02:18:09.160 --> 02:18:14.760]  by the way I had Bill Ayers on about a month ago and he literally said he wasn't
[02:18:14.760 --> 02:18:18.840]  a communist said I was making it up said none of this ever happened and so
[02:18:18.840 --> 02:18:22.600]  they're now in that mode of acting passive acting friendly acting non-threatening
[02:18:22.600 --> 02:18:26.720]  and I could tell he was reading off a script right what they do is they change
[02:18:26.720 --> 02:18:31.760]  the terminology instead of we want to murder you the terminology is folks and
[02:18:31.760 --> 02:18:38.160]  families but the agenda is exactly the same it's to use the supportive people
[02:18:38.160 --> 02:18:42.720]  for helping them to in fact destroy them and we've seen over the last 30
[02:18:42.720 --> 02:18:47.160]  years the Democrat Party has been taken over by these radical Marxists out of
[02:18:47.160 --> 02:18:53.000]  Chicago and today the Democrat Party is a radical socialist party and in my film
[02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:56.080]  dreams for my real father which you mentioned it was it was back in the
[02:18:56.080 --> 02:19:03.280]  news with Rudy Giuliani mentioning that Obama's mentor was a the Communist Party
[02:19:03.280 --> 02:19:07.120]  USA propagandist Frank Marshall Davis of course in my film which is in your
[02:19:07.120 --> 02:19:11.280]  store still dreams for my real father I think I present a mountain of evidence
[02:19:11.280 --> 02:19:17.520]  that Obama's real biological father who became his ideological mentor was in
[02:19:17.520 --> 02:19:22.960]  fact the Soviet agent Frank Marshall Davis who indoctrinated him into this
[02:19:22.960 --> 02:19:28.800]  radical ideology in his entire youth and today we're seeing the unfortunately
[02:19:28.800 --> 02:19:34.760]  the end game of a radical in office you know when I heard all this six seven
[02:19:34.760 --> 02:19:37.480]  years ago I didn't believe it but there's no way it's not true and the
[02:19:37.480 --> 02:19:41.120]  evidence is overwhelming we are in so much trouble and what were are the elite
[02:19:41.120 --> 02:19:45.240]  thinking doing something this crazy and reckless well why didn't Nero marry his
[02:19:45.240 --> 02:19:49.600]  horse why did there was a Caligula married his horse I guess Nero did stuff

[02:24:14.720 --> 02:24:19.520]  news articles legislation documents to back up our claims we have a wide
[02:24:19.520 --> 02:24:24.640]  spectrum of guests on who don't even ideologically agree with each other 90%
[02:24:24.640 --> 02:24:29.680]  or 80% but who genuinely want freedom and have shown their experts in their
[02:24:29.680 --> 02:24:34.000]  field to have a real discussion a real debate try to understand what's
[02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:39.040]  happening and if you look at how the Democratic Party especially attacks
[02:24:39.040 --> 02:24:44.160]  families attacks anybody who's good tries to de-industrialize the country
[02:24:44.160 --> 02:24:49.240]  they really want us on our knees so they can then dictate the terms of our
[02:24:49.240 --> 02:24:54.760]  surrender and they just hate this country because we were a Christian
[02:24:54.760 --> 02:24:58.240]  nation we were a free market nation if they bring us down they have the whole
[02:24:58.240 --> 02:25:02.600]  world the problem is most their supporters are good people who are
[02:25:02.600 --> 02:25:06.600]  manipulated and don't know what they're part of we're talking to Joel Gilbert the
[02:25:06.600 --> 02:25:10.600]  maker of there's no place like utopia an excellent film available at info or

[02:25:23.120 --> 02:25:27.760]  Gilbert net's website it's excellent Joel continue in the short segment long
[02:25:27.760 --> 02:25:32.560]  segment coming up then we'll go to some calls understanding the power grab we're
[02:25:32.560 --> 02:25:37.320]  seeing what do you think from your expert research the agenda is in the next
[02:25:37.320 --> 02:25:44.720]  two years we've seen this game plan play out it's not a new agenda it's the same
[02:25:44.720 --> 02:25:50.760]  old story where a radical leftist Marxist group takes over a legitimate
[02:25:50.760 --> 02:25:55.880]  political party like the Democrat Party tricks the party itself into thinking
[02:25:55.880 --> 02:25:59.960]  that their mainstream Obama told the country he's gonna cut the deficit in
[02:25:59.960 --> 02:26:04.680]  half Obamacare is not a tax he'll obey the Constitution it was a mainstream
[02:26:04.680 --> 02:26:09.480]  candidate with an agenda that he never intended to implement that's why my film
[02:26:09.480 --> 02:26:14.160]  there's no place like utopia I compare Obama to the Wizard of Oz because he was
[02:26:14.160 --> 02:26:19.920]  a charlatan from the get-go and his intentions were never good when Dorothy
[02:26:19.920 --> 02:26:24.760]  gets to the witches to the Emerald City the Wizard of Oz sends her to the
[02:26:24.760 --> 02:26:29.120]  witches castle she's taken prisoner in the dungeon and that's what's happened in
[02:26:29.120 --> 02:26:32.640]  all the progressive cities throughout America that I travel to in the film
[02:26:32.640 --> 02:26:38.200]  Detroit Chicago Denver Newark people are literally living in these witches
[02:26:38.200 --> 02:26:43.560]  castles the dungeons of progressivism where they have 50% unemployment drug
[02:26:43.560 --> 02:26:48.880]  cultures no fathers no business they brought this devastation upon America
[02:26:48.880 --> 02:26:52.760]  through these progressive policies and they only succeeded because they
[02:26:52.760 --> 02:26:57.480]  manipulated and fooled not only their own party but the American people into
[02:26:57.480 --> 02:27:01.360]  supporting them and giving them power once they're in power they use the tools
[02:27:01.360 --> 02:27:07.040]  of state like the IRS the control of information unemployment is only 5%
[02:27:07.040 --> 02:27:10.960]  well that's what I found whenever I've been around socialists and communists at
[02:27:10.960 --> 02:27:15.360]  events over the decades I've been around a lot of them and you know all sorts of
[02:27:15.360 --> 02:27:19.720]  behind-the-scenes democratic conventions they're really like criminal
[02:27:19.720 --> 02:27:23.720]  bank robber types like like felon types I've been around before that are really
[02:27:23.720 --> 02:27:28.200]  creepy and have bad will towards people and behind the scenes they'll go listen
[02:27:28.200 --> 02:27:32.120]  when we take over we're gonna kill everybody we want blood they really are
[02:27:32.120 --> 02:27:38.080]  demonic villains but then in the service is like I'm a liberal I mean they are
[02:27:38.080 --> 02:27:44.800]  just so sick right they've the entire program of progressivism is based on
[02:27:44.800 --> 02:27:48.360]  disinformation and that's what the Democrat Party in the White House
[02:27:48.360 --> 02:27:52.960]  engages in today I said the unemployment is 5% there's voter
[02:27:52.960 --> 02:27:59.840]  suppression a completely made-up story on and on the entire agenda is based on
[02:27:59.840 --> 02:28:04.920]  a manipulation and providing false information it's disinformation Soviet
[02:28:04.920 --> 02:28:09.120]  era propaganda coming out of the White House and you'll see the Democrat
[02:28:09.120 --> 02:28:14.760]  candidate whoever it's gonna be in 2016 is going to say that we have racial
[02:28:14.760 --> 02:28:19.920]  inequality and income inequality and there's a few fortunate people who are
[02:28:19.920 --> 02:28:24.520]  controlling all the economy and that's what everyone else has to rise up and
[02:28:24.520 --> 02:28:29.000]  support the Democrat Party so it's a type of mafia it always has been and they
[02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:34.400]  simply use the benefits of the state to enrich themselves while creating one
[02:28:34.400 --> 02:28:39.680]  large lower class socialist economies don't have a middle class they have an
[02:28:39.680 --> 02:28:43.640]  impoverished society with political elites who control the wealth they're
[02:28:43.640 --> 02:28:52.480]  very medieval I would say so they're a you know it's a it's a group of people
[02:28:52.480 --> 02:28:57.760]  that want to control others and to be willing to lie and lie about everything
[02:28:57.760 --> 02:29:02.840]  it just shows you the evil nature of those who would lie to take power and
[02:29:02.840 --> 02:29:08.600]  then use the tools to suppress everybody else it's a very evil plan and
[02:29:08.600 --> 02:29:16.400]  we're seeing it sure not not in you know 1940s 1950s China with Mao sending 50
[02:29:16.400 --> 02:29:20.800]  million people to to being starved to death in collective farms or the Soviet
[02:29:20.800 --> 02:29:24.720]  gulags we're seeing the disinformation in modern America we're seeing an
[02:29:24.720 --> 02:29:30.160]  incrementally just deindustrialized the country and again then we have the
[02:29:30.160 --> 02:29:34.440]  Republican leadership a bunch of blue blood fascist who side with the
[02:29:34.440 --> 02:29:37.280]  Democrats I want to talk about that when you when you come back talk about the

[02:38:29.400 --> 02:38:30.960]  to look at what's happening
[02:38:30.960 --> 02:38:34.560]  how successful has obama been opposition is mounting
[02:38:34.560 --> 02:38:36.800]  what do you expect him to do next
[02:38:36.800 --> 02:38:40.160]  uh... what are you most concerned about i mean kind of as a play by play joel
[02:38:40.160 --> 02:38:40.800]  gilbert
[02:38:40.800 --> 02:38:44.280]  where are we as a society right now from your perspective
[02:38:44.280 --> 02:38:47.800]  well first taking a lot of course there's uh... endless commentary for the
[02:38:47.800 --> 02:38:48.560]  past
[02:38:48.560 --> 02:38:53.000]  several years about his uh... failure as a president failure and foreign policy
[02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:54.880]  failure in the economy
[02:38:54.880 --> 02:38:58.600]  uh... from his point of view which is what i've been tracing and documenting in
[02:38:58.600 --> 02:38:59.760]  my films
[02:38:59.760 --> 02:39:03.200]  from his point of view he's been very successful because all of this
[02:39:03.200 --> 02:39:05.680]  was an intentional plan from the get-go
[02:39:05.680 --> 02:39:07.360]  uh... bankrupting
[02:39:07.360 --> 02:39:10.680]  uh... the the country uh... doubling the deficit
[02:39:10.680 --> 02:39:14.760]  uh... in letting the country be invaded by illegals which includes
[02:39:14.760 --> 02:39:17.680]  tremendous amount of criminals in cure california
[02:39:17.680 --> 02:39:21.040]  forty percent of all prison inmates are illegals
[02:39:21.040 --> 02:39:24.240]  we've got the norteños sudanios all kind of gangs
[02:39:24.240 --> 02:39:27.720]  so these are the people coming across the border in addition to obama's so
[02:39:27.720 --> 02:39:31.640]  called striving immigrants looking to work hard
[02:39:31.640 --> 02:39:35.520]  uh... so this has been the agenda to divide the country
[02:39:35.520 --> 02:39:39.600]  uh... to break up the united states was the dream of the
[02:39:39.600 --> 02:39:43.160]  sds weather underground and the kgb from the get-go
[02:39:43.160 --> 02:39:48.120]  uh... to allow these forces to maintain power in chaos domestically
[02:39:48.120 --> 02:39:49.160]  and the
[02:39:49.160 --> 02:39:52.000]  evil bad guys abroad to be able to
[02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:54.840]  extend and project their power without american
[02:39:54.840 --> 02:39:55.800]  influence
[02:39:55.800 --> 02:39:58.040]  uh... in their way
[02:39:58.040 --> 02:40:03.280]  the agenda of the islamist movement whether it's isis or iran
[02:40:03.280 --> 02:40:06.360]  is the same as the marxist movement they have a lot in common
[02:40:06.360 --> 02:40:08.200]  and that's why they work together
[02:40:08.200 --> 02:40:12.680]  they both view western capitalist systems free markets free speech
[02:40:12.680 --> 02:40:15.480]  as the number one obstacle to taking power
[02:40:15.480 --> 02:40:17.160]  therefore together
[02:40:17.160 --> 02:40:18.200]  they view
[02:40:18.200 --> 02:40:20.800]  western society is the number one target
[02:40:20.800 --> 02:40:22.720]  on the path to salvation
[02:40:22.720 --> 02:40:24.400]  uh... in islam
[02:40:24.400 --> 02:40:27.640]  worldly events are an affirmation of faith
[02:40:27.640 --> 02:40:30.520]  uh... therefore iran attaining a nuclear weapon
[02:40:30.520 --> 02:40:32.000]  and being able to
[02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:36.480]  not necessarily even use it just use it as a strategic umbrella
[02:40:36.480 --> 02:40:39.120]  to continue their hegemony through
[02:40:39.120 --> 02:40:40.840]  uh... taking over of
[02:40:40.840 --> 02:40:44.000]  of a country by country in the middle east whether it's yemen
[02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:47.320]  uh... extended influence to lebanon syria
[02:40:47.320 --> 02:40:50.360]  and and elsewhere it's a segment of power
[02:40:50.360 --> 02:40:54.520]  it's what's all away if you if you have a nuclear capability
[02:40:54.520 --> 02:40:58.440]  you can then your conventional forces have free reign because no one will
[02:40:58.440 --> 02:40:59.920]  will attempt to stop you
[02:40:59.920 --> 02:41:02.320]  so the obama agenda unfortunately
[02:41:02.320 --> 02:41:05.840]  uh... according to from obama's point of view is unfolding very very
[02:41:05.840 --> 02:41:07.040]  successfully
[02:41:07.040 --> 02:41:10.400]  uh... he's divided the country along economic i agree obama has been a
[02:41:10.400 --> 02:41:14.040]  devastatingly successful globalist socialist
[02:41:14.040 --> 02:41:17.200]  and then you got the big money banks funding him thinking that once there's a
[02:41:17.200 --> 02:41:20.760]  tyranny they'll everybody's fighting for the ring of mordor
[02:41:20.760 --> 02:41:23.020]  all these different special interest groups
[02:41:23.020 --> 02:41:26.160]  they're all supporting tyranny because they think they're going to get greater
[02:41:26.160 --> 02:41:27.380]  power out of it
[02:41:27.380 --> 02:41:29.680]  when instead it's destroying stability
[02:41:29.680 --> 02:41:31.760]  and destroying a future for humanity
[02:41:31.760 --> 02:41:33.680]  i mean it's so sick
[02:41:33.680 --> 02:41:34.760]  unfortunately
[02:41:34.760 --> 02:41:37.800]  people don't realize that uh... the utopia
[02:41:37.800 --> 02:41:42.080]  uh... on earth is uh... america before barack obama america as a
[02:41:42.080 --> 02:41:44.040]  constitutional government
[02:41:44.040 --> 02:41:45.400]  with uh...
[02:41:45.400 --> 02:41:48.280]  free markets free speech limited government
[02:41:48.280 --> 02:41:50.680]  this is as close to utopia as we can get on earth
[02:41:50.680 --> 02:41:52.520]  look what our country produced
[02:41:52.520 --> 02:41:56.240]  the america patents most of the devices higher standard of living highest
[02:41:56.240 --> 02:41:57.400]  rates of savings
[02:41:57.400 --> 02:42:00.280]  and as soon as we left free market we become a hell pit
[02:42:00.280 --> 02:42:02.520]  most unhealthy highest debt
[02:42:02.520 --> 02:42:04.760]  high exactly all sorts of problems
[02:42:04.760 --> 02:42:09.040]  exactly but obama has to lie about it michelle obama barack obama now the
[02:42:09.040 --> 02:42:10.840]  entire democrat party
[02:42:10.840 --> 02:42:12.120]  they cannot
[02:42:12.120 --> 02:42:14.200]  justify radical change
[02:42:14.200 --> 02:42:18.040]  if everything is going great if we have free markets and independence
[02:42:18.040 --> 02:42:19.920]  and and a great economy
[02:42:19.920 --> 02:42:21.600]  they have to tell us that
[02:42:21.600 --> 02:42:25.760]  everything is broken immigration is broken everything is unfair everything
[02:42:25.760 --> 02:42:27.000]  has an equal
[02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:30.960]  and their solution is give us the power and will make it right for you
[02:42:30.960 --> 02:42:33.880]  will fix everything that's broken now the way they fix things that are
[02:42:33.880 --> 02:42:35.600]  supposedly broken is
[02:42:35.600 --> 02:42:39.960]  they want to completely destroy them so they can rebuild it from scratch this
[02:42:39.960 --> 02:42:41.520]  socialist utopia
[02:42:41.520 --> 02:42:44.960]  which we know from history is nothing but a hell on earth
[02:42:44.960 --> 02:42:48.400]  that's right we got a few minutes left with joel gilbert here today other
[02:42:48.400 --> 02:42:52.480]  points you'd like to get across warnings you'd like to get across to people
[02:42:52.480 --> 02:42:54.560]  uh... and then first my question
[02:42:54.560 --> 02:42:58.160]  if he's been so successful and he's now power grabbing on every front
[02:42:58.160 --> 02:43:00.440]  and the republican leadership won't block him
[02:43:00.440 --> 02:43:02.520]  what do we do i mean remove baner
[02:43:02.520 --> 02:43:04.840]  there is a move to do that how do we
[02:43:04.840 --> 02:43:07.000]  get sanity back into congress
[02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:10.280]  well we were supposed to have a balance of power between the executive
[02:43:10.280 --> 02:43:11.680]  legislative
[02:43:11.680 --> 02:43:16.160]  and judicial branches unfortunately the uh... legislative branch of republicans
[02:43:16.160 --> 02:43:17.720]  the established republicans
[02:43:17.720 --> 02:43:22.800]  have capitulated or remained in fear of opposing obama this has been a
[02:43:22.800 --> 02:43:24.240]  colossal failure
[02:43:24.240 --> 02:43:25.320]  of the
[02:43:25.320 --> 02:43:29.000]  the balance of power system the judicial branch
[02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:31.840]  has done almost nothing we have a little
[02:43:31.840 --> 02:43:35.080]  a potential a halt in the image legal immigration
[02:43:35.080 --> 02:43:38.560]  uh... grab uh... policies of obama in texas
[02:43:38.560 --> 02:43:41.120]  but by and large the balance of power
[02:43:41.120 --> 02:43:43.960]  system has fallen by the wayside
[02:43:43.960 --> 02:43:44.760]  uh...
[02:43:44.760 --> 02:43:47.000]  against obama's executive
[02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:50.520]  uh... power on on on on onslaught on every level
[02:43:50.520 --> 02:43:54.460]  so i think the best and perhaps only in last hope
[02:43:54.460 --> 02:43:57.720]  is to replace the
[02:43:57.720 --> 02:44:00.520]  obama with a strong conservative
[02:44:00.520 --> 02:44:02.800]  uh... president two thousand sixteen
[02:44:02.800 --> 02:44:05.760]  that can go about reversing all the damage
[02:44:05.760 --> 02:44:09.360]  and all the lawlessness that obama has brought to america
[02:44:09.360 --> 02:44:13.720]  and and pull us back together and strengthen the rules and laws
[02:44:13.720 --> 02:44:16.320]  so that if a radical socialist
[02:44:16.320 --> 02:44:19.280]  were to take power in the executive branch in the future
[02:44:19.280 --> 02:44:21.640]  that he would not be able to overreach
[02:44:21.640 --> 02:44:24.360]  uh... and extend a lawless rain
[02:44:24.360 --> 02:44:26.760]  in trying to destroy the country
[02:44:26.760 --> 02:44:31.560]  well it's a special interest combined with the socialist that allows this and
[02:44:31.560 --> 02:44:34.800]  so many big corporations are lined up giving money
[02:44:34.800 --> 02:44:37.720]  to support a consolidation of power because again they think they'll get the
[02:44:37.720 --> 02:44:39.360]  ring of mordor
[02:44:39.360 --> 02:44:42.440]  we need to throw the ring of mordor back into the crack where it came from and
[02:44:42.440 --> 02:44:46.240]  stop using it
[02:44:46.240 --> 02:44:49.120]  no one understand they don't understand
[02:44:49.120 --> 02:44:53.400]  to this day other some people are coming around really juliani
[02:44:53.400 --> 02:44:56.880]  came around a little bit i've talked to many u.s senators in congressman who've
[02:44:56.880 --> 02:44:58.340]  all seen my film
[02:44:58.340 --> 02:45:02.560]  they know what's up but it's hard for the main mainstream media
[02:45:02.560 --> 02:45:06.560]  is unwilling to tell the truth which is that barack obama
[02:45:06.560 --> 02:45:07.880]  is a radical
[02:45:07.880 --> 02:45:11.920]  well look at how juliani came out and said obama doesn't like america
[02:45:11.920 --> 02:45:15.720]  that is destroying it which is true and i'm not even a juliani fan
[02:45:15.720 --> 02:45:19.080]  uh... for you know he was compared to most republicans pretty liberal
[02:45:19.080 --> 02:45:22.840]  and then seeing it at the headline the end of juliani the fall was everywhere
[02:45:22.840 --> 02:45:24.800]  he's horrible he's discredited
[02:45:24.800 --> 02:45:27.720]  i mean it's just like they fired for money night football
[02:45:27.720 --> 02:45:30.040]  thank williams junior is he criticized obama
[02:45:30.040 --> 02:45:32.240]  this is an anti-free speech cult
[02:45:32.240 --> 02:45:34.760]  and so that's why congress is so scared of him
[02:45:34.760 --> 02:45:38.080]  right it is because they're scared of being you know attack but
[02:45:38.080 --> 02:45:41.440]  the mainstream media doesn't have the power it used to have
[02:45:41.440 --> 02:45:43.040]  it's more a paper tiger
[02:45:43.040 --> 02:45:45.760]  whose bark is bigger than it's by its toothless
[02:45:45.760 --> 02:45:48.920]  i i think people should want to be attacked by the established but that's
[02:45:48.920 --> 02:45:50.080]  why ran paul
[02:45:50.080 --> 02:45:51.360]  one in kentucky
[02:45:51.360 --> 02:45:52.960]  was because they came after him
[02:45:52.960 --> 02:45:54.360]  people need to
[02:45:54.360 --> 02:45:58.160]  wallow in the enemy's attacks instead of running from
[02:45:58.160 --> 02:46:02.320]  but there's only a very few politicians that are willing to do that because they're looking to
[02:46:02.320 --> 02:46:06.080]  hang on to their job they don't want to be really killed or isolated which is
[02:46:06.080 --> 02:46:07.440]  part of their game plan
[02:46:07.440 --> 02:46:12.040]  but juliani told part of the story obama doesn't love america he was raised by
[02:46:12.040 --> 02:46:13.680]  radical communists
[02:46:13.680 --> 02:46:16.960]  the other part of the story if you take it to the next level is
[02:46:16.960 --> 02:46:21.040]  uh... obama is is one of them only a radical communist
[02:46:21.040 --> 02:46:25.160]  uh... would hate america would try to destroy america
[02:46:25.160 --> 02:46:29.760]  all the biggest story that still has to be told in the mainstream media is
[02:46:29.760 --> 02:46:34.400]  barack obama is all lies everything about his personal background was a lie
[02:46:34.400 --> 02:46:37.120]  everything about his political agenda was a lie
[02:46:37.120 --> 02:46:39.720]  and the biggest fraud in the history
[02:46:39.720 --> 02:46:42.920]  of this country was perpetrated upon the electorate
[02:46:42.920 --> 02:46:44.480]  by barack obama
[02:46:44.480 --> 02:46:48.600]  backed by the mainstream media that simply reputed all his life right
[02:46:48.600 --> 02:46:51.560]  you cannot make up the magnitude of the screw job
[02:46:51.560 --> 02:46:55.160]  uh... i mean i can't even believe it i'm supposed to be the big conspiracy theorist
[02:46:55.160 --> 02:46:58.720]  uh... i mean i saw the washington post in like three other publications
[02:46:58.720 --> 02:47:03.240]  last friday people are like give us the fcc takeover document
[02:47:03.240 --> 02:47:06.960]  and they they said oh conspiracy theorists you don't get it
[02:47:06.960 --> 02:47:11.320]  so so it's a fact they're keeping it secret it's a fact it gives the fcc
[02:47:11.320 --> 02:47:13.720]  controlled it's a fact obama's behind it
[02:47:13.720 --> 02:47:15.320]  and hillary and polosi love it
[02:47:15.320 --> 02:47:18.000]  it's a fact all these other commissioners say that they've seen it it's a
[02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:19.280]  power grab
[02:47:19.280 --> 02:47:23.560]  but now we're five six days into this and we still can't see it
[02:47:23.560 --> 02:47:26.640]  and when we ask for it were conspiracy theorist
[02:47:26.640 --> 02:47:29.000]  i mean talk about this information joel
[02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:32.640]  yeah look uh... uh... obama's first assault on the constitution was his
[02:47:32.640 --> 02:47:35.480]  refusal to leave release his birth certificate
[02:47:35.480 --> 02:47:37.480]  when he got away with that
[02:47:37.480 --> 02:47:41.200]  uh... he got away with fast and furious when he got away with not releasing the
[02:47:41.200 --> 02:47:42.960]  documents for fast and furious
[02:47:42.960 --> 02:47:46.680]  he got away with using the irs and weaponizing it against political
[02:47:46.680 --> 02:47:49.240]  eminent enemies because
[02:47:49.240 --> 02:47:53.520]  we've never been able to hold obama accountable for the lack of transparency
[02:47:53.520 --> 02:47:55.640]  for the lies for the deception
[02:47:55.640 --> 02:47:59.840]  is the reason he just continues on and on now it's accelerating federalizing
[02:47:59.840 --> 02:48:04.200]  police opening borders banning bullets i mean what's that's the last question
[02:48:04.200 --> 02:48:05.800]  what's the next you to drop them
[02:48:05.800 --> 02:48:09.520]  i mean what it's incredible i mean if you if he's accelerating towards light
[02:48:09.520 --> 02:48:11.040]  speed right now
[02:48:11.040 --> 02:48:14.200]  we're about to really see some incredible power grabbing
[02:48:14.200 --> 02:48:16.000]  well the goal is to
[02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:17.960]  create a situation where
[02:48:17.960 --> 02:48:22.440]  they can manipulate control the uh... future elections presidential elections
[02:48:22.440 --> 02:48:23.840]  congressional elections
[02:48:23.840 --> 02:48:25.440]  to create a permanent
[02:48:25.440 --> 02:48:27.520]  socialist state in america
[02:48:27.520 --> 02:48:30.880]  and with people kind of never realizing how it happened
[02:48:30.880 --> 02:48:34.560]  nobody voted for any of this all of obama's policies
[02:48:34.560 --> 02:48:35.840]  were uh...
[02:48:35.840 --> 02:48:39.320]  an agenda that he hid from the public he threw his voters under the bus
[02:48:39.320 --> 02:48:42.840]  including all the african-americans double unemployment notice now google
[02:48:42.840 --> 02:48:46.520]  announces they're going to let snopes and other groups connected to soros
[02:48:46.520 --> 02:48:47.600]  decide
[02:48:47.600 --> 02:48:51.080]  what's credible and isn't and basically d-list websites you know they're
[02:48:51.080 --> 02:48:52.320]  talking about us
[02:48:52.320 --> 02:48:55.440]  so so they're coming after everything right now folks you better

[02:49:15.320 --> 02:49:17.240]  nothing can stop human intelligence

[02:49:29.440 --> 02:49:31.040]  joel gilbert
[02:49:31.040 --> 02:49:34.680]  uh... my point then is simply that uh...
[02:49:34.680 --> 02:49:35.960]  middle america
[02:49:35.960 --> 02:49:38.360]  church going hardworking people
[02:49:38.360 --> 02:49:42.280]  will never buy into the progressive agenda and the left has known this from
[02:49:42.280 --> 02:49:45.640]  the get-go better cleaners are coming after as they're called terrorist
[02:49:45.640 --> 02:49:50.480]  right so their entire agenda from the get-go was to eliminate the middle class
[02:49:50.480 --> 02:49:54.480]  destroy of the connection between religion and society
[02:49:54.480 --> 02:49:55.800]  uh... destroy
[02:49:55.800 --> 02:49:57.000]  the health care

[02:49:58.360 --> 02:50:02.640]  uh... voting power of middle america that supports the constitution
[02:50:02.640 --> 02:50:04.160]  and the free market system
[02:50:04.160 --> 02:50:07.480]  everything obama is doing is an assault on middle america
[02:50:07.480 --> 02:50:10.280]  an attempt to degrade and destroy it
[02:50:10.280 --> 02:50:13.200]  to pave the way for their control of information
[02:50:13.200 --> 02:50:16.640]  that's right when he's hanging out with billionaires in san francisco
[02:50:16.640 --> 02:50:19.480]  he says we're gonna get these better cleaners we're gonna be we are their
[02:50:19.480 --> 02:50:20.560]  enemy

[02:50:26.080 --> 02:50:28.040]  it's meant to degrade
[02:50:28.040 --> 02:50:29.320]  middle america
[02:50:29.320 --> 02:50:32.960]  that they know will never buy into the progress of military operation

[02:55:30.880 --> 02:55:37.560]  America when these to me these useless people in Congress stand up and applaud
[02:55:37.560 --> 02:55:45.200]  someone who in I think 2002 I have a quote as far as I know this is accurate
[02:55:45.200 --> 02:55:50.280]  he said Netanyahu said America can dry up and blow away with the wind when we
[02:55:50.280 --> 02:55:55.480]  have finished with it America can dry up and blow away with the when we have
[02:55:55.480 --> 02:55:59.600]  finished with it now that's not the to me the quote from a friend and I think
[02:55:59.600 --> 02:56:02.600]  let me ask you this do you have video of that I mean what's the source of that
[02:56:02.600 --> 02:56:06.640]  because I see these quotes I see these quotes about myself that I didn't say
[02:56:06.640 --> 02:56:12.840]  I'm not I mean what's the source of that we got it on the internet here I have a
[02:56:12.840 --> 02:56:21.520]  it says veterans today it says Netanyahu for president of America veterans
[02:56:21.520 --> 02:56:27.160]  today yeah you know that's a great named website but I'm not gonna I'm just
[02:56:27.160 --> 02:56:30.400]  gonna leave it at that I mean that yeah that's considered the source of that I
[02:56:30.400 --> 02:56:34.960]  but I'd like to what's their source of it where'd it come from that I their
[02:56:34.960 --> 02:56:39.400]  source do you have their source on it I'm not sure I don't have it at hand it
[02:56:39.400 --> 02:56:46.920]  was oh okay yeah the story is that it was an ex CIA overheard him in a
[02:56:46.920 --> 02:56:52.640]  conversation you know that site criticizes me too right you know I did
[02:56:52.640 --> 02:56:57.120]  not know that I mean I don't care it's just I don't mind please more of it
[02:56:57.120 --> 02:57:01.040]  it's just that a lot of these sites you claim I'm an Israeli agent I've never
[02:57:01.040 --> 02:57:07.120]  been to Israel I've never I was basically approached by a famous member of
[02:57:07.120 --> 02:57:09.960]  Israeli intelligence who came to my office and was a little bit threatening
[02:57:09.960 --> 02:57:16.880]  but but other than that I've been I have no connections to Israel yeah well I we
[02:57:16.880 --> 02:57:21.040]  think you know I think you'd mentioned it earlier referred to the the globalists
[02:57:21.040 --> 02:57:24.200]  that then there I guess they're they're working for the globalists or I should
[02:57:24.200 --> 02:57:28.800]  say the Israeli leadership well sure all I'm saying is brother is that if Israel
[02:57:28.800 --> 02:57:33.040]  brought up blew away tomorrow all this stuff will continue on it's evil in the
[02:57:33.040 --> 02:57:37.800]  human soul that is causing us our problems and that's what I'm getting at
[02:57:37.800 --> 02:57:41.360]  but there's a lot of legitimate criticisms of Israel let me give you one
[02:57:41.360 --> 02:57:47.280]  Israel has race laws where if you're a worker contract skilled worker in the
[02:57:47.280 --> 02:57:53.040]  country German Vietnamese and doesn't matter you are arrested and deported if
[02:57:53.040 --> 02:57:59.000]  you have sex with a Jew now that's a fact now the very same political correct
[02:57:59.000 --> 02:58:04.320]  groups support that in Israel but then tell everybody you know here a
[02:58:04.320 --> 02:58:08.200]  socialist agenda and men are bad men shouldn't wear pants women should be the
[02:58:08.200 --> 02:58:13.560]  boss of everything so my problem is Israel's got some arcane things that go
[02:58:13.560 --> 02:58:17.600]  on there that I don't agree with it isn't because I'm against Israel in
[02:58:17.600 --> 02:58:21.720]  general it's just that that's going on so see and you can look up what I just
[02:58:21.720 --> 02:58:27.120]  said you can look up I just don't ever really hear any real criticism by the
[02:58:27.120 --> 02:58:33.200]  real anti-Semites out there they make stuff up I mean you know Photoshop you
[02:58:33.200 --> 02:58:37.000]  name it it just is a bucket of baloney thank you Steve we'll be back with more
[02:58:37.000 --> 02:58:41.080]  calls stay with us Sean and others Tom you name it we're gonna go to everybody
[02:58:41.080 --> 02:58:55.360]  over the Genesis communications radio network Alex Jones here the last two years I've been working with top doctors nutritionist and chemist to design a
[02:58:55.360 --> 02:58:59.760]  nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits so many
[02:58:59.760 --> 02:59:03.600]  other formulations out there contain toxic ingredients synthetic additives
[02:59:03.600 --> 02:59:08.400]  and even GMOs introducing the all-new ancient defense herbal immunity blend
[02:59:08.400 --> 02:59:14.080]  crafted with over 14 key ancient herbs and extracts to supercharge and prepare

[02:59:18.360 --> 02:59:22.400]  have rejected hundreds of other formulations in our quest to bring you
[02:59:22.400 --> 02:59:26.720]  what is simply the most powerful and comprehensive proprietary formula that
[02:59:26.720 --> 02:59:31.120]  we have ever created in the realm of herbal immunity experience the benefits
[02:59:31.120 --> 02:59:36.480]  of combining over 14 ancient herbs and extracts with exciting new advances in
[02:59:36.480 --> 02:59:40.840]  nutraceutical science now is the time to secure ancient defense for you and your

[03:00:01.440 --> 03:00:06.240]  radio network probably presents the Alex Jones show because there's a
[03:00:06.240 --> 03:00:13.080]  war on for your mind we got some good news up on Twitter at real Alex Jones
[03:00:13.080 --> 03:00:16.960]  or processed foods really on their way out craft foods Kellogg's and others
[03:00:16.960 --> 03:00:22.480]  put in McDonald's are in deep financial trouble so is Coca-Cola and people are
[03:00:22.480 --> 03:00:27.240]  voting with their dollars that's what the real revolution is Sean in Texas
[03:00:27.240 --> 03:00:32.640]  Sean you're on the air go ahead hey thanks for having me Alex welcome go ahead
[03:00:32.640 --> 03:00:38.400]  thank you I just wanted to make one good point when it comes down to the
[03:00:38.400 --> 03:00:42.120]  conversation you were having with Joe when it comes to climate change and this
[03:00:42.120 --> 03:00:45.760]  is a lot of BS and everything that's going on with them pushing co2 and
[03:00:45.760 --> 03:00:49.560]  wanting to do the department taxes and it's like you know what you know the
[03:00:49.560 --> 03:00:53.840]  world's been going through cycles for many many generations Sun cycles and
[03:00:53.840 --> 03:00:56.800]  everything else that you all are talking about and there's a great platform out
[03:00:56.800 --> 03:01:02.000]  there where people could actually look at the government information that they
[03:01:02.000 --> 03:01:05.040]  put out and there's a lot of people actually come back on the forum say hey
[03:01:05.040 --> 03:01:09.080]  you know we're getting disinformation on some ends to take away information and
[03:01:09.080 --> 03:01:13.040]  stuff when you presented to us in the mainstream media is not making sense
[03:01:13.040 --> 03:01:16.760]  through the data even got a NASA's own satellites it says the earth cooling and
[03:01:16.760 --> 03:01:20.240]  then it gets on the news they say it's warming but that didn't work so now they
[03:01:20.240 --> 03:01:25.040]  just say hey how dare you Alex or Lord Monkton say the earth does it change
[03:01:25.040 --> 03:01:28.600]  we're like we didn't say that so see they flipped it from man make a little
[03:01:28.600 --> 03:01:35.120]  warming to change period is evil and that we're denying there's change I mean
[03:01:35.120 --> 03:01:40.000]  it's a very childish propaganda well do you want there's people out there
[03:01:40.000 --> 03:01:43.520]  fighting it you know along with Joe I want to introduce a lot of people to a
[03:01:43.520 --> 03:01:47.320]  bed name I got named Ben Davidson he runs a
[03:01:47.320 --> 03:01:51.800]  website called suspicious observers and he puts out a lot of disinformation and
[03:01:51.800 --> 03:01:55.480]  gives a great perspective that I believe if you go in and research or to have
[03:01:55.480 --> 03:01:59.160]  your guys yeah we'll check it out brother thanks for the tip OBD in Boston
[03:01:59.160 --> 03:02:04.000]  hope I'm pronouncing that right you're on the air on BB speech go ahead good
[03:02:04.000 --> 03:02:08.400]  brother go ahead yes I mean a couple points I want to touch on first of all
[03:02:08.400 --> 03:02:12.120]  being the men y'all's piece today you know I do think there's a lot of nuance
[03:02:12.120 --> 03:02:15.920]  and everything is like multifaceted as you were saying before not you know it's
[03:02:15.920 --> 03:02:19.760]  not black and white however with men y'all will be involved in the other
[03:02:19.760 --> 03:02:22.480]  projects for the new America's venture I think it's called with Jack Bush and
[03:02:22.480 --> 03:02:26.480]  everyone else you know orchestrating 9-11 absolutely you look at the PNAC
[03:02:26.480 --> 03:02:32.200]  documents and you look at who's involved it's a bunch of Israeli operatives and
[03:02:32.200 --> 03:02:35.360]  clearly they were involved with Saudi Arabia and up their eyeballs in 9-11
[03:02:35.360 --> 03:02:38.880]  and we talked about earlier absolutely yeah so I'm not saying that it's you know
[03:02:38.880 --> 03:02:42.840]  Jews were behind everything or the Israel's behind everything but there is a
[03:02:42.840 --> 03:02:48.360]  Jewish mafia involved in a lot of the criminal operations exactly and if you
[03:02:48.360 --> 03:02:51.600]  want to get a little bit metaphysical with it in terms of you know biblical
[03:02:51.600 --> 03:02:54.840]  and stuff like that to that component whether or not you know for the reason
[03:02:54.840 --> 03:02:57.880]  that they don't see Jesus as the Messiah will they you know openly embrace the
[03:02:57.880 --> 03:03:01.520]  Antichrist I think that's something to explore because of the funding of the
[03:03:01.520 --> 03:03:06.840]  Bible actually says a false leader will come and it'll be in Jerusalem being
[03:03:06.840 --> 03:03:11.520]  worshipped so now if he shows up people say that we've got to worship Israel so
[03:03:11.520 --> 03:03:15.560]  it must be Jesus and that'll be the great deception I know it's very complex
[03:03:15.560 --> 03:03:20.040]  and very scary you know I think that you know not only with the whole thing being
[03:03:20.040 --> 03:03:23.720]  driven between the West and Islam I think it's that Israel kind of almost
[03:03:23.720 --> 03:03:27.880]  wants to emerge from the nuclear holocaust and actually kind of get it
[03:03:27.880 --> 03:03:35.280]  started with Russia and kind of using America but others in that in that
[03:03:35.280 --> 03:03:39.760]  global globalist party are kind of bringing things to a head that's right
[03:03:39.760 --> 03:03:44.120]  there in all the nations playing us off against ourselves it's a it's a
[03:03:44.120 --> 03:03:48.720]  conspiracy of the devil against humanity and that's what I'm trying to get at
[03:03:48.720 --> 03:03:52.920]  it's evil in the minds and hearts of men and women and it's good in the minds and
[03:03:52.920 --> 03:03:56.840]  hearts that's the real manifesting battle we're the pawns on the chess board
[03:03:56.840 --> 03:04:00.600]  great point sir I'm gonna jam in one more chat in Washington sorry to the
[03:04:00.600 --> 03:04:08.240]  others just speaking with what Lord Monkton was talking about earlier I
[03:04:08.240 --> 03:04:13.280]  just would really like it if he would bring up climbing engineering and you
[03:04:13.280 --> 03:04:17.320]  know the stratosphere carousel ejection next time he's on I'm gonna get Nico and
[03:04:17.320 --> 03:04:20.440]  folks with good memories to have me bring up how does geoengineering come
[03:04:20.440 --> 03:04:23.400]  into it because even the London Guardian admits that could be hurting the
[03:04:23.400 --> 03:04:28.560]  weather yeah and I've done a lot of research into it and that's basically
[03:04:28.560 --> 03:04:34.200]  my thing is trying to expose it for what it is absolutely gotta jump sorry Tom
[03:04:34.200 --> 03:04:38.200]  I'm gonna give you 20 seconds state auditors dead Missouri what's going on
[03:04:38.200 --> 03:04:44.360]  that's right Alex he was the governor's candidate also that happened Thursday he
[03:04:44.360 --> 03:04:49.600]  called about 940 in the morning to the newspaper to set up a press release and
[03:04:49.600 --> 03:04:55.000]  about 10 minutes later the police were responding to a gunshot wound that's
[03:04:55.000 --> 03:05:17.280]  happening more and more we'll look into that thanks for the tip
