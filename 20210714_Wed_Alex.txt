[00:00.000 --> 00:27.240]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:27.240 --> 00:33.120]  As far as the public was concerned, the Nazis may have lost the war, but their ideology
[00:33.120 --> 00:36.480]  has continued to spread ever since.
[00:36.480 --> 00:42.240]  Following World War II came the United Nations, mass fluoridation of the water supply, the
[00:42.240 --> 00:49.840]  dumbing down of the education system, postmodernism, political correctness, and the war on drugs.
[00:49.840 --> 00:52.440]  For many, this has gone unnoticed.
[00:52.440 --> 00:56.240]  The Nazis became the pop culture model of fascism.
[00:56.240 --> 01:01.200]  Black leather and jack boots became the symbols of authoritarianism.
[01:01.200 --> 01:06.280]  Fascism could now hide itself behind a smile and a suit and a tie.
[01:06.280 --> 01:13.600]  The majority had no idea of the global fascist state being slowly installed behind the scenes.
[01:13.600 --> 01:15.120]  And now it's here.
[01:15.120 --> 01:21.120]  COVID was just the beginning of their end game, the same private corporations and NGOs
[01:21.120 --> 01:26.760]  that planned and executed the COVID hoax are now preparing the next phase.
[01:26.760 --> 01:29.920]  We can soon expect a massive cyber attack.
[01:29.920 --> 01:39.800]  We all know, but still, pay insufficient attention to the frightening scenario of a comprehensive
[01:39.800 --> 01:52.080]  cyber attack, which would bring to a complete halt to see power supply, transportation,
[01:52.080 --> 01:54.080]  hospital services, our society as a whole.
[01:54.080 --> 02:02.720]  The COVID-19 crisis would be seen in this respect as a small disturbance in comparison.
[02:02.720 --> 02:08.560]  The World Economic Forum, who sponsored tabletop simulations for COVID just weeks before the
[02:08.560 --> 02:15.360]  outbreak, are now doing the same for cyber attacks, which will be the reset button needed
[02:15.360 --> 02:18.480]  for their great reset.
[02:18.480 --> 02:23.120]  And when the grid goes down, it will take banking and shipping down with it, killing
[02:23.120 --> 02:27.000]  millions in the overcrowded cities.
[02:27.000 --> 02:31.560]  Those with a survival instinct will leave the cities, which is why the Rural Domestic
[02:31.560 --> 02:37.200]  Preparedness Consortium, a part of Homeland Security and FEMA, is currently training for
[02:37.200 --> 02:42.080]  the isolation and quarantine of rural communities.
[02:42.080 --> 02:47.880]  After their great reset, we know how they plan to build back better.
[02:47.880 --> 02:55.240]  Two key agents of the great reset, Regina Dugan and Ken Gabriel, both worked for DARPA, Greenlit
[02:55.240 --> 03:00.680]  RNA Vaccine Research in 2012, and then went on to Google and Facebook, where they set
[03:00.680 --> 03:02.680]  up DARPA equivalents.
[03:02.680 --> 03:11.080]  In 2018, they joined Welcome Leap, founded by the world's richest medical research foundation.
[03:11.080 --> 03:17.440]  Their stated goal, to be completed no later than 2030, is to have 80 percent of all children
[03:17.440 --> 03:23.400]  under the age of three monitored 24-7 with wearable devices that will read their brain
[03:23.400 --> 03:30.840]  patterns, specifically focusing on keeping the individual motivated to work.
[03:30.840 --> 03:36.640]  They plan to have an in-silico model of a child's brain, to be used as the model brain,
[03:36.640 --> 03:41.960]  that all infants will be molded to via therapeutic interventions.
[03:41.960 --> 03:47.720]  Like slaves in a dystopian sci-fi movie, except this is not a movie, and it's no longer a
[03:47.720 --> 03:51.960]  conspiracy theory, it's all happening.
[03:51.960 --> 03:57.440]  The entire world is under attack, with seemingly no pushback.
[03:57.440 --> 04:04.720]  And if we don't pushback, then it's all over, and we have nobody to blame but ourselves.
[04:04.720 --> 04:34.680]  For InfoWars.com, this is Greg Rees.
[04:35.720 --> 04:40.240]  Again, that's Free World News, God TV.
[04:40.240 --> 04:44.800]  It's all coming together, it's all been announced, and the CDC just came out in public documents
[04:44.800 --> 04:49.400]  and said they're preparing forced quarantine centers this fall.
[04:49.400 --> 04:52.600]  Joe Biden, the dictator, will declare martial law.
[04:52.600 --> 04:58.800]  Stay with us, we'll be back.
[04:58.800 --> 05:04.800]  Iodine is one of the most important drivers of the body for fertility, for cellular function,
[05:04.800 --> 05:05.800]  for libido, for life.
[05:05.800 --> 05:09.000]  If you don't have iodine, you die in a matter of months.
[05:09.000 --> 05:12.160]  So if you don't have oxygen, you die in four minutes, you don't have water, you die in
[05:12.160 --> 05:14.800]  a week or so, you don't have food a month or so.
[05:14.800 --> 05:15.800]  But what's in that food?
[05:15.800 --> 05:16.800]  Iodine.
[05:16.800 --> 05:21.640]  But if your food doesn't have that atomic pure iodine, it can't operate, and the food
[05:21.640 --> 05:23.200]  itself is lacking.
[05:23.200 --> 05:27.760]  That's why most people on earth are deficient in iodine, and governments are lowering the
[05:27.760 --> 05:31.000]  allowance you're supposedly yet need to have, because they want control.
[05:31.000 --> 05:35.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, our information is powerful, our products are just as powerful.
[05:35.120 --> 05:40.080]  Experience clean iodine today, it's discounted, 40% off in the dropper bottle, 60% off in

[05:44.360 --> 05:46.480]  pay for your points, at infowarstore.com.
[05:46.480 --> 05:50.400]  Don't wait any longer, just like our information is powerful, our products are just as powerful.

[05:57.600 --> 05:58.600]  Get X2.
[05:58.600 --> 06:19.720]  The only way to stop this globalist takeover is to recognize that it's taking place and
[06:19.720 --> 06:25.640]  that the supposed guardians of international and national security are controlled by very
[06:25.640 --> 06:32.520]  ruthless global corporations that are staging crises to consolidate power and control and
[06:32.520 --> 06:39.560]  to bankrupt the West and to starve to death the third world.
[06:39.560 --> 06:47.120]  Out of that accelerated crisis, the social engineers will then build their new world
[06:47.120 --> 06:48.120]  order.
[06:48.120 --> 06:53.360]  And there's the headline on infowarstore.com today's live show feed, Biden preparing to
[06:53.360 --> 07:00.920]  declare martial law during second lockdown as CDC readies COVID isolation camps across
[07:00.920 --> 07:01.920]  the U.S.
[07:01.920 --> 07:04.720]  We'll show you all those documents here in a moment.
[07:04.720 --> 07:08.960]  And of course, that's all now been admitted, but we'll show you the specifics.
[07:08.960 --> 07:09.960]  Think about it.
[07:09.960 --> 07:12.280]  They knew they were going to get rid of Trump using mail-in ballots and fraud.
[07:12.280 --> 07:13.280]  They said that.
[07:13.280 --> 07:17.640]  They said it looked like he wins that night, red mirage, but we'll have the mail-in ballots
[07:17.640 --> 07:21.560]  one way or another, Biden will win.
[07:21.560 --> 07:27.760]  And so that way, Trump already presided over martial law light and the lockdowns and the
[07:27.760 --> 07:33.160]  stay-at-home orders which are home arrest, house arrest, which is hardcore martial law
[07:33.160 --> 07:35.600]  actually in that case.
[07:35.600 --> 07:37.360]  But that was just the icebreaker.
[07:37.360 --> 07:42.760]  Then they get their puppet into position.
[07:42.760 --> 07:47.320]  Then they start hyping up deaths that are happening from pneumonia and the flu as the
[07:47.320 --> 07:48.800]  fall comes.
[07:48.800 --> 07:56.640]  They inject people with virus-making machines that even U.S. day-to-day, Reuters, the New
[07:56.640 --> 08:04.480]  York Times, NPR admit, and the Nobel Prize winner in virology say will create real deadly
[08:04.480 --> 08:05.480]  variants.
[08:05.480 --> 08:12.000]  See, humans are so powerful that even most deadly viruses mutate quickly and we become
[08:12.000 --> 08:13.120]  immune to them.
[08:13.120 --> 08:16.520]  Most mutations make things less strong.
[08:16.520 --> 08:20.760]  But not the case of COVID, it's very, very real.
[08:20.760 --> 08:25.680]  The first phase, as I told you a year and a half ago, is a weak variant, but it's synthetic
[08:25.680 --> 08:27.400]  and they own it.
[08:27.400 --> 08:35.680]  Then once it incubates in the body, it starts shedding viruses that have a deadly spike protein
[08:35.680 --> 08:38.560]  in them and then you start seeing accelerated illnesses.
[08:38.560 --> 08:41.720]  We're already seeing per capita more deaths this year than last year.
[08:41.720 --> 08:47.440]  We're already seeing most of the people that are dying of supposed COVID have been inoculated.
[08:47.440 --> 08:50.320]  This is in the federal reports.
[08:50.320 --> 08:51.320]  This is confirmed.
[08:51.320 --> 08:54.480]  This is medical doctors and nurses filing these.
[08:54.480 --> 08:57.640]  10,000 reports and fares of death.
[08:57.640 --> 09:03.280]  More than all the deaths ever previously reported, they think maybe one out of 40 on average
[09:03.280 --> 09:04.920]  is the actual scientific study.
[09:04.920 --> 09:09.320]  They say maybe it's one out of 10 report, one out of 100, it's about one out of 40 report.
[09:09.320 --> 09:13.720]  It's 40 times that.
[09:13.720 --> 09:15.760]  It's all starting to come out.
[09:15.760 --> 09:18.000]  It's just such a horrible scenario.
[09:18.000 --> 09:22.080]  But they need a smoke screen to cut the economy off, they need a smoke screen to then offer
[09:22.080 --> 09:28.480]  you a universal income as the lifejacket, as the lifeboat.
[09:28.480 --> 09:32.480]  They throw you into the water, then they say, oh, here's a little lifejacket for you, we're
[09:32.480 --> 09:36.960]  your savior, but we've got a rope connected to it now.
[09:36.960 --> 09:40.800]  You're not the boat with us, you're out there in the water, and you have to do what we say
[09:40.800 --> 09:43.560]  or we'll cut the rope.
[09:43.560 --> 09:44.960]  We are being held hostage.
[09:44.960 --> 09:48.240]  This is all an extremely diabolical, evil plan.
[09:48.240 --> 09:53.600]  It's even in the Rockefeller Foundation report, 2011, Operation Lockstep, where they describe
[09:53.600 --> 09:55.840]  every damn better than in great detail.
[09:55.840 --> 10:02.120]  And that's what's so frustrating and nauseating to me, is that I know what this is, I know
[10:02.120 --> 10:06.940]  where it leads, and I know that if we just woke up to it, and our governors and legislature
[10:06.940 --> 10:12.680]  woke up, and we indicted Gates, and indicted Klaus Schwab, and indicted Fauci, they should
[10:12.680 --> 10:16.640]  all be swat deemed a year ago.
[10:16.640 --> 10:20.600]  And roll up this criminal network, it's game over, but they're in the positions of doctors
[10:20.600 --> 10:28.320]  and scientists and academics, and so it's a new type of war using viruses and using fear
[10:28.320 --> 10:33.560]  directed by the corporate world government via the UN with the media lockstep censoring
[10:33.560 --> 10:41.720]  real data and real information so they can carry this out.
[10:41.720 --> 10:47.440]  So ladies and gentlemen, I'm just completely horrified by what's going on, and I can't
[10:47.440 --> 10:53.480]  even get my own family that knows I'm smart and knows this is real to come to grips with
[10:53.480 --> 10:56.520]  it.
[10:56.520 --> 11:01.600]  I tell family about stuff, and they're like, okay, great, hey, we ought to go on a trip,
[11:01.600 --> 11:09.760]  we ought to go camping or something, or hey, are you coming to our wedding anniversary,
[11:09.760 --> 11:17.600]  which is all fine and dandy, but that's rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic.
[11:17.600 --> 11:20.400]  Every minute we're still on air is incredibly precious.
[11:20.400 --> 11:26.720]  This is a damn New World Order scientific takeover, 21st century fifth-generational warfare.
[11:26.720 --> 11:30.320]  In the New World Order's own damn words, Schwab says we're waging war against the over bloom
[11:30.320 --> 11:34.320]  of humans like he's some superman, Uber mentioned.
[11:34.320 --> 11:38.040]  They say they're going to have carbon locked down, and they're going to destroy the infrastructure
[11:38.040 --> 11:42.560]  where you're not even able to get fuel.
[11:42.560 --> 11:49.520]  They're creating a total two-tiered society, a breakaway civilization, and I'm staying
[11:49.520 --> 11:53.480]  on the boat trying to save people, trying to warn folks it's going down, and most of
[11:53.480 --> 11:58.560]  now they don't even understand it, so I can't even get my own family to get out of their
[11:58.560 --> 12:01.760]  trance and say maybe we should get in a lifeboat.
[12:01.760 --> 12:02.760]  What is a lifeboat?
[12:02.760 --> 12:07.160]  I can't even have a discussion with my own family about where we're going to be in six
[12:07.160 --> 12:11.880]  months, a year, two years.
[12:11.880 --> 12:14.000]  They're not pulling back from this thing, okay?
[12:14.000 --> 12:15.000]  And I get it.
[12:15.000 --> 12:19.800]  Everybody has normalcy bias, and so you think, oh, well, they only shut it down for a year,
[12:19.800 --> 12:23.520]  and yeah, things were closed for a while, and we were non-essential, and we did this
[12:23.520 --> 12:27.680]  nonsensical six feet apart, and yeah, a lot of folks are getting sick from these shots,
[12:27.680 --> 12:30.960]  and let's just muddle through it, and things will get back to normal.
[12:30.960 --> 12:36.000]  They're never getting back to normal in the words of all the top globalists.
[12:36.000 --> 12:43.280]  It is a permanent takeover.
[12:43.280 --> 12:46.120]  This is the end if people don't get serious.
[12:46.120 --> 12:47.440]  This crew is amazing.
[12:47.440 --> 12:50.360]  They're here, they see everything I see, so they know I'm not being apocalyptic.
[12:50.360 --> 12:53.720]  I'm trying to figure out how we stop this by admitting we're an emergency.
[12:53.720 --> 12:59.280]  The house is on fire, better put it out quick or it'll consume everything.
[12:59.280 --> 13:07.200]  Rob do gets it, Greg Reese gets it.
[13:07.200 --> 13:11.320]  The real people that are awake understand that we're on a sinking ship, ladies and gentlemen,
[13:11.320 --> 13:16.440]  with no lifeboats, and what's going to happen when the general public figures out what's
[13:16.440 --> 13:17.440]  going down?
[13:17.440 --> 13:23.240]  They're going to trigger a race war and say everything collapsed because of rioting.
[13:23.240 --> 13:24.240]  How do I know that?
[13:24.240 --> 13:27.200]  It's in the IMF World Bank plants.
[13:27.200 --> 13:32.880]  From 2001 leaked to Greg Powell's back when the BBC still had some soul, 100-plus pages
[13:32.880 --> 13:37.400]  leaked where the IMF World Bank had imploded the third world and how they would then cut
[13:37.400 --> 13:42.080]  off the food and water, have a political riot, usually make it between two racial or religious
[13:42.080 --> 13:46.800]  groups as the cover for why the country then has totally collapsed so the IMF World Bank
[13:46.800 --> 13:52.280]  can come up and buy it for pennies on the dollar, and in that the IMF World Bank said
[13:52.280 --> 14:00.120]  we want to do this to the first world next, we're going to do it to Greece as a test.
[14:00.120 --> 14:01.120]  And what was it?
[14:01.120 --> 14:05.920]  Six, seven years later they did it to Greece, then they said we're going to do it to the
[14:05.920 --> 14:13.360]  Middle East, then they did it to Africa, then they did it to Latin America and now they're
[14:13.360 --> 14:18.760]  doing it to us because we take it.
[14:18.760 --> 14:24.360]  And so you look at what's going on right now in South Africa, the trigger is a president
[14:24.360 --> 14:29.240]  being in trouble, a former president, but no, it's the resources cut off for over a year,
[14:29.240 --> 14:34.280]  it's the starvation, it's the people giving up on any hope and everything then collapses
[14:34.280 --> 14:39.680]  and that's coming here, it's coming everywhere, hell we already saw it last summer.
[14:39.680 --> 14:45.120]  So I'm not being alarmist, the house is already on fire, I'm not saying put a tourniquet on
[14:45.120 --> 14:53.080]  a leg, the damn legs cut off, I'm not saying put a tourniquet on a leg because it's going
[14:53.080 --> 14:56.920]  to get cut off.
[14:56.920 --> 15:02.400]  And I'm a tough guy, okay, I can take a lie, but let me tell you, I'm pretty shook up right
[15:02.400 --> 15:08.040]  now because I'd hope this was just a beta test and no, they've gone all out, this is
[15:08.040 --> 15:12.440]  the blitzkrieg, this is the lightning war, this is the attack, this is time to get right
[15:12.440 --> 15:18.480]  with Jesus and let me tell you, when there ain't food for a month, your neighbors will
[15:18.480 --> 15:23.560]  eat your ass like I told you a year ago and I told you that's where this was all leading
[15:23.560 --> 15:29.040]  and we didn't stop it and there's not much time left.
[15:29.040 --> 15:36.600]  Fauci and Gates and Schwab, you can start with somebody like Cuomo, give them orders
[15:36.600 --> 15:40.920]  to kill all those people, they start getting arrested, their whole plan comes out in the
[15:40.920 --> 15:47.640]  open or it's over, we don't have much time, I'm Alex Jones, your host, we're gonna lay
[15:47.640 --> 15:51.320]  it all out, they're getting their damn FEMA camps ready for us, they're gonna use COVID
[15:51.320 --> 16:00.480]  as the cover, stay with us, we'll be right back.
[16:00.480 --> 16:06.600]  Your voice counts, when you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes
[16:06.600 --> 16:07.600]  the world.
[16:07.600 --> 16:12.320]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular, they know you're angry and now to get around
[16:12.320 --> 16:16.600]  big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.

[17:02.240 --> 17:11.240]  Here's a man who can show you.
[17:11.240 --> 17:20.080]  Triple 82533139, triple 82533139, triple 82533139, triple 82533139, triple 82533139, triple 82533139,
[17:20.080 --> 17:33.520]  triple 82533139, is the Info Wars Store hotline, triple 82533139 is the info wars store hotline,
[17:33.520 --> 17:42.080]  triple 82533139 is the Info Wars Store hotline,
[17:42.080 --> 17:43.920]  and beats out all the rest.
[17:43.920 --> 17:45.600]  Triple H, 2x3, 3139.
[17:45.600 --> 17:47.240]  Triple H, 2x3, 3139.
[17:47.240 --> 17:50.640]  Triple H, 2x3, 3139 is the endboard or the upline.
[17:50.640 --> 17:52.240]  Triple H, 2x3, 3139.
[17:52.240 --> 17:53.880]  Triple H, 2x3, 3139.
[17:53.880 --> 17:55.660]  Triple H, 2x3, 3139.
[17:55.660 --> 17:58.120]  That's info at store.com.
[17:58.120 --> 18:01.560]  X2 has been our number one best seller over the years.
[18:01.560 --> 18:04.320]  Deep Earth Crystal iodine, the good halogen,
[18:04.320 --> 18:07.240]  it is essential for all actions in the body.
[18:07.240 --> 18:08.740]  You must have it to live.
[18:08.740 --> 18:10.320]  The UN estimates 2 billion plus people
[18:10.320 --> 18:11.480]  have cognitive disabilities
[18:11.480 --> 18:12.840]  because they don't have enough iodine.
[18:12.840 --> 18:14.800]  We have X2 at two different bottles,
[18:14.800 --> 18:16.200]  the same amount in each bottle,
[18:16.200 --> 18:18.520]  but one has a spray top, one has a dropper top.
[18:18.520 --> 18:20.720]  60% off on the spray top,
[18:20.720 --> 18:24.000]  40% off on the dropper top for a limited time
[18:24.000 --> 18:25.840]  because they're both selling out.
[18:25.840 --> 18:27.200]  I wanna thank all of the supporters
[18:27.200 --> 18:28.240]  that have gotten these over the years.
[18:28.240 --> 18:29.160]  They're amazing.
[18:29.160 --> 18:31.320]  So that's a great deal for you to stock up on it.
[18:31.320 --> 18:34.240]  But this deal is really for folks that have been on the fence
[18:34.240 --> 18:36.720]  and haven't experienced the good halogen for yourself.
[18:36.720 --> 18:39.360]  So X2, the dropper bottle and the spray bottle,
[18:39.360 --> 18:41.840]  60 and 40% off for a limited time
[18:41.840 --> 18:44.600]  because it's selling out right now at infowarstore.com.
[18:44.600 --> 18:46.800]  But we're gonna keep the sell going till it sells out.
[18:46.800 --> 18:48.280]  Probably take about two weeks.
[18:48.280 --> 18:49.440]  Don't procrastinate.
[18:49.440 --> 18:51.200]  Take advantage of this special right now
[18:51.200 --> 18:53.480]  at infowarstore.com and check out the new products
[18:53.480 --> 18:54.640]  we just got in as well.
[18:54.640 --> 19:04.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[19:24.640 --> 19:48.080]  You won't hear me, but you'll hear me.
[19:48.080 --> 20:00.520]  You'll hear me, but you'll hear me.
[20:00.520 --> 20:13.040]  You'll hear me, but you'll hear me.
[20:13.040 --> 20:20.800]  You'll hear me, but you'll hear me.
[20:20.800 --> 20:26.120]  I'm gonna explain how it all works right now.
[20:26.120 --> 20:28.960]  And people can either listen to me
[20:28.960 --> 20:35.920]  and understand the enemy plan and stop it, or you can die.
[20:35.920 --> 20:39.760]  Now let's go into it right now.
[20:39.760 --> 20:45.960]  Let's lay it out for everybody very slowly, very succinctly,
[20:45.960 --> 20:46.840]  very calmly.
[20:50.840 --> 20:54.640]  Christians created the modern world
[20:54.640 --> 20:58.400]  and humans were finally able, because of the Renaissance
[20:58.400 --> 21:05.360]  and Christianity and a mixture of things that developed,
[21:05.360 --> 21:08.480]  to build a high-tech industrialized world
[21:08.480 --> 21:12.200]  and it took 500 years to do it.
[21:12.200 --> 21:15.000]  Just a solar flare hitting the planet right
[21:15.000 --> 21:19.640]  could end our industrial civilization just like that,
[21:19.640 --> 21:25.200]  frying every power line across entire continents
[21:25.200 --> 21:27.240]  that would cause a chain reaction that would bring down
[21:27.240 --> 21:29.120]  civilization.
[21:29.120 --> 21:32.560]  Because we've built everything very tenuously
[21:32.560 --> 21:37.280]  with just enough power, just enough wiring.
[21:37.280 --> 21:40.960]  Everything is just on time delivery.
[21:40.960 --> 21:44.720]  You put a wrinkle into that.
[21:44.720 --> 21:50.120]  You upset that with a year-plus lockdown on the third world.
[21:50.120 --> 21:51.800]  That sends ripples into the first world
[21:51.800 --> 21:55.760]  that devastate economies and consolidate control.
[21:55.760 --> 21:59.160]  That was only a test, ladies and gentlemen.
[21:59.160 --> 22:09.080]  And now, because overall governments and corporations
[22:09.080 --> 22:12.160]  and media went along with it and they got away with it
[22:12.160 --> 22:14.160]  and they got away with suppressing cures
[22:14.160 --> 22:16.400]  and they got away with suppressing illnesses
[22:16.400 --> 22:19.240]  and vaccine damage, because so far they've gotten away
[22:19.240 --> 22:23.640]  with it, not completely, but they've gotten away with it,
[22:23.640 --> 22:25.920]  they're going ahead with the next phase.
[22:25.920 --> 22:28.600]  And it's all right here.
[22:28.600 --> 22:30.920]  The former head of Health and Human Services under Obama,
[22:30.920 --> 22:32.680]  and that means the head of Health and Human Services.
[22:32.680 --> 22:33.960]  Obama runs the show.
[22:33.960 --> 22:36.640]  It's that former administration is in command right now.
[22:36.640 --> 22:37.760]  On record.
[22:37.760 --> 22:38.720]  They don't even deny it.
[22:38.720 --> 22:41.440]  He's got his own White House, half mile from the White House.
[22:41.440 --> 22:44.800]  Tone, compound, three buildings, everything.
[22:44.800 --> 22:48.280]  And she said, people will play the clip next segment
[22:48.280 --> 22:50.720]  that don't take these shots, these experimental shots
[22:50.720 --> 22:53.480]  that have killed so many people, right off the bat.
[22:53.480 --> 22:55.720]  Imagine the long-term effect.
[22:55.720 --> 22:57.760]  They shouldn't be able to have access to children,
[22:57.760 --> 23:00.920]  including their own children, shouldn't be able to have jobs.
[23:00.920 --> 23:01.880]  So fire you.
[23:01.880 --> 23:03.240]  Put you on the street.
[23:03.240 --> 23:04.600]  That's total war.
[23:04.600 --> 23:06.920]  Violation, Nuremberg code, right there.
[23:06.920 --> 23:08.360]  You shouldn't have access to children,
[23:08.360 --> 23:09.400]  including your own children.
[23:09.400 --> 23:12.000]  So you should lose your job and lose your children.
[23:13.520 --> 23:14.840]  What'd I tell you about the UN saying,
[23:14.840 --> 23:15.840]  we want to go into the homes
[23:15.840 --> 23:18.960]  and take the children out of the families, remember?
[23:18.960 --> 23:20.880]  That's the holy grail is take your children.
[23:20.880 --> 23:22.080]  If they can't kill them in the womb,
[23:22.080 --> 23:23.560]  they're going to get them later.
[23:23.560 --> 23:26.000]  So remember, the target is always our youth
[23:26.000 --> 23:28.880]  from this species or whatever these things are
[23:28.880 --> 23:30.160]  that inhabit humans now.
[23:30.160 --> 23:31.400]  And I believe it's extraterrestrial.
[23:31.400 --> 23:33.360]  And I don't say that to be shocking.
[23:33.360 --> 23:35.800]  It's not human. Everybody knows that now.
[23:35.800 --> 23:37.680]  I don't get into what it is or how it operates.
[23:37.680 --> 23:39.280]  The Bible says it's fallen.
[23:39.280 --> 23:40.520]  It operates in the fourth dimension
[23:40.520 --> 23:42.360]  to the third dimension. It's bad news.
[23:44.600 --> 23:45.960]  And it wants our kids.
[23:45.960 --> 23:47.280]  Just like you want to pull over after work
[23:47.280 --> 23:49.560]  and get a cold beer, maybe an ice cream cone
[23:49.560 --> 23:50.800]  or a cheeseburger or something.
[23:50.800 --> 23:53.080]  They want your children's essence.
[23:53.080 --> 23:56.240]  And the whole world is designed to get the children.
[23:57.680 --> 23:59.840]  And as soon as you realize that, everything flows.
[23:59.840 --> 24:03.280]  Like Christ said, Satan wants to target the children.
[24:03.280 --> 24:04.960]  And if you don't protect them
[24:04.960 --> 24:07.040]  and if you don't suffer for them,
[24:07.040 --> 24:09.840]  that's what suffers the children suffer for the children
[24:09.840 --> 24:11.840]  or I'm going to destroy your soul.
[24:13.200 --> 24:15.160]  Real simple directive, isn't it?
[24:15.160 --> 24:17.840]  Number one job, protect the children.
[24:17.840 --> 24:19.000]  And that means old people.
[24:19.000 --> 24:20.400]  That means mentally retarded people.
[24:20.400 --> 24:22.520]  That means weak people.
[24:22.520 --> 24:23.800]  What's the new world order directive?
[24:23.800 --> 24:26.280]  Kill the weak, kill the weak, kill the weak, kill the weak.
[24:26.280 --> 24:28.200]  Oh, but they don't just mean kill the weak, do they?
[24:28.200 --> 24:30.240]  They want to kill every one of us.
[24:30.240 --> 24:32.560]  And if they can trick us to kill the weak,
[24:32.560 --> 24:35.600]  when our whole system and our impotence is,
[24:37.560 --> 24:39.040]  even somebody that isn't a big tough guy,
[24:39.040 --> 24:40.240]  somebody starts beating their kid up,
[24:40.240 --> 24:41.880]  they'll beat the hell out of them.
[24:41.880 --> 24:43.400]  Even people that aren't looking for a fight.
[24:43.400 --> 24:45.720]  You start picking on some old man or some old woman.
[24:45.720 --> 24:47.600]  Just an average guy, I'll get up and kick the hell out
[24:47.600 --> 24:50.040]  of some big bully because he just pissed off about it.
[24:50.040 --> 24:52.520]  Pick a chair up, smash it over their head
[24:52.520 --> 24:56.440]  because our spirit doesn't like messing with weak people.
[24:58.720 --> 25:03.040]  But this satanic system loves abusing the living hell out of it.
[25:05.240 --> 25:08.440]  And all of existence on this planet is about getting
[25:08.440 --> 25:11.080]  in the position of deciding which side you're on.
[25:11.080 --> 25:12.280]  All right, I'm gonna stop.
[25:12.280 --> 25:14.120]  You know, I try to get up here and be calm.
[25:14.120 --> 25:17.880]  You know, in person, in private, I'm super slick.
[25:17.880 --> 25:21.360]  But by that, I mean talking to a woman or blacks,
[25:21.360 --> 25:23.240]  I sound like Barry White.
[25:24.320 --> 25:26.600]  But you know, I get up here on air
[25:26.600 --> 25:28.520]  and I sound like a frantic person
[25:28.520 --> 25:31.120]  because I am frantic, ladies and gentlemen.
[25:32.440 --> 25:34.000]  I'm desperate.
[25:34.000 --> 25:36.120]  I'm watching everything unfold.
[25:36.120 --> 25:38.400]  And instead, everybody's like, boy, bitch, you're happy.
[25:38.400 --> 25:40.720]  You've got a lot of credibility right now.
[25:40.720 --> 25:43.280]  But I'm the dam operator.
[25:43.280 --> 25:44.160]  I see the dam break.
[25:44.160 --> 25:46.120]  I radio down to the town five miles away
[25:46.120 --> 25:48.320]  that, you know, billions of gallons
[25:48.320 --> 25:49.800]  is coming to kill you in five minutes.
[25:49.800 --> 25:52.640]  And they go, boy, I bet you're feeling like a hero right now.
[25:52.640 --> 25:54.560]  You told us the dam broke.
[25:54.560 --> 25:59.080]  For God, when, what does that even mean?
[26:01.200 --> 26:04.920]  So I am not gonna sit here like I did 30 years ago
[26:04.920 --> 26:07.080]  and 20 years ago and 10 years ago
[26:07.080 --> 26:09.080]  and five years ago and a year ago
[26:09.080 --> 26:10.840]  and have and be sitting here,
[26:10.840 --> 26:12.720]  not even on air in a year probably,
[26:12.720 --> 26:14.560]  with total deaths in bedlam and war
[26:14.560 --> 26:16.640]  and martial law and starvation going on,
[26:16.640 --> 26:19.320]  zombie apocalypse basically is what they've been planning.
[26:19.320 --> 26:21.400]  And that's how the average person
[26:21.400 --> 26:23.560]  acts in about a week without food.
[26:23.560 --> 26:25.600]  I'm not gonna be sitting here going,
[26:25.600 --> 26:26.560]  oh, isn't it great?
[26:26.560 --> 26:27.760]  I've been proven right again.
[26:27.760 --> 26:29.680]  It won't matter then.
[26:31.560 --> 26:34.640]  And so I can feel the earnestness.
[26:34.640 --> 26:36.320]  I can feel the concern.
[26:36.320 --> 26:40.240]  I can intellectually see all the pieces of it.
[26:41.760 --> 26:43.640]  And like I said, my biggest frustration is,
[26:43.640 --> 26:45.240]  and I'll just say this all on air,
[26:47.040 --> 26:48.680]  I can't get,
[26:48.680 --> 26:49.760]  I guess I just gotta be a leader
[26:49.760 --> 26:50.880]  and decide what I'm gonna do.
[26:50.880 --> 26:52.400]  You know, cause I can't blame my family.
[26:52.400 --> 26:54.920]  I can't blame anybody about not knowing what to do.
[26:54.920 --> 26:57.520]  And people are like, okay, well, let's go watch a movie.
[26:57.520 --> 26:59.160]  Go watch a movie with all this going on.
[26:59.160 --> 27:00.880]  Or, hey, let's go down and get a steak.
[27:00.880 --> 27:02.960]  Yeah, or let's go to our neighbor's house
[27:02.960 --> 27:04.080]  and drink martinis.
[27:05.600 --> 27:08.040]  That's all gone, folks.
[27:08.040 --> 27:10.000]  And I'm not bitching at you cause you want a martini.
[27:10.000 --> 27:11.800]  You don't think I don't want one?
[27:11.800 --> 27:14.920]  I cannot sit here while this is going down
[27:14.920 --> 27:16.760]  and not act like it's a big deal.
[27:17.920 --> 27:19.960]  And let's get something real straight for everybody.
[27:19.960 --> 27:23.000]  COVID-19's a real virus and it's killed a bunch of people.
[27:23.960 --> 27:26.760]  And they're getting ready to release ones that are far worse.
[27:27.960 --> 27:30.600]  And I've tried to unpack and explain that to everybody.
[27:32.320 --> 27:33.960]  But it's not as deadly as they said,
[27:33.960 --> 27:35.880]  and the solutions they have were not the solutions,
[27:35.880 --> 27:39.440]  and they suppressed the cures cause they're mass murderers.
[27:39.440 --> 27:41.760]  And so it's hard for me to look at Fauci or Bill Gates,
[27:41.760 --> 27:43.880]  who are mass murderers,
[27:45.200 --> 27:47.080]  and have killed people I know,
[27:47.080 --> 27:49.120]  and to sit there and take it.
[27:49.120 --> 27:50.960]  Cause if I sit there and take it,
[27:50.960 --> 27:52.280]  it means I'm gonna take it more
[27:52.280 --> 27:53.440]  when they kill me and my family,
[27:53.440 --> 27:54.640]  and I'm gonna sit there and take it.
[27:54.640 --> 27:55.840]  You got that, Bill Gates?
[27:57.520 --> 27:59.000]  I don't like coming to you
[27:59.000 --> 28:01.320]  and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[28:01.320 --> 28:02.800]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years,
[28:02.800 --> 28:05.040]  and only the last year or so have I said that.
[28:05.040 --> 28:06.680]  But let me tell you, the new world orders
[28:06.680 --> 28:08.280]  breathe them down our neck.
[28:08.280 --> 28:10.600]  The big, globalist publications are coming after us,
[28:10.600 --> 28:12.640]  and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[28:12.640 --> 28:15.480]  So please pray to keep Info Wars on the air,
[28:15.480 --> 28:16.920]  and please support the local states
[28:16.920 --> 28:18.400]  you're listening to as well.
[28:18.400 --> 28:20.920]  At the same time, go to infowarstore.com
[28:20.920 --> 28:23.040]  while you still can, and get a book,
[28:23.040 --> 28:26.000]  get a film, get a t-shirt, get some supplements,
[28:26.000 --> 28:29.080]  because it's that money that helps us stay on air
[28:29.080 --> 28:30.560]  in the face of this thing.
[28:30.560 --> 28:32.680]  I need your help more than ever now.
[28:32.680 --> 28:34.160]  I wanna keep fighting the globalists,
[28:34.160 --> 28:36.880]  but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[28:36.880 --> 28:39.360]  So pray for us, word of mouth,
[28:39.360 --> 28:41.640]  tell folks about the broadcast however you can,
[28:41.640 --> 28:43.960]  and buy great products that will enrich you
[28:43.960 --> 28:47.480]  and your family's lives every day at infowarstore.com.
[28:47.480 --> 28:49.000]  Whether it's high quality coffee,
[28:49.000 --> 28:51.120]  or supplements, or books or films,
[28:51.120 --> 28:52.880]  all of it nurtures the soul,
[28:52.880 --> 28:54.480]  all of it empowers humanity,
[28:54.480 --> 28:57.000]  all of it is pro-human and pro-God.
[28:57.000 --> 28:58.280]  Thank you so much.
[28:58.280 --> 29:00.960]  Alex Jones here with two big announcements
[29:00.960 --> 29:02.080]  in the next 60 seconds.
[29:02.080 --> 29:04.560]  First off, green fiber capsules,
[29:04.560 --> 29:06.280]  highest quality fiber you're gonna find
[29:06.280 --> 29:08.600]  with all the amino acids and a ton of vitamins
[29:08.600 --> 29:09.440]  and minerals.
[29:09.440 --> 29:10.880]  This is an incredible formula.
[29:10.880 --> 29:12.320]  Everybody should be taking it.
[29:12.320 --> 29:14.600]  Men, women, children, old, young, black, white,
[29:14.600 --> 29:16.440]  it doesn't matter, it's an amazing product.
[29:16.440 --> 29:17.600]  It's our newest product.
[29:17.600 --> 29:20.960]  It's 50% off out of the gates, infowarstore.com.
[29:20.960 --> 29:23.000]  Then we have both types of X2s,
[29:23.000 --> 29:24.240]  the exact same X2 with a bottle,
[29:24.240 --> 29:26.800]  but one has a spray cap, one has a dropper cap,
[29:26.800 --> 29:29.560]  for 60 and 40% off, depending on which one,
[29:29.560 --> 29:31.680]  they're both excellent at infowarstore.com.
[29:31.680 --> 29:34.200]  The 60% off of the spray bottle is unprecedented,
[29:34.200 --> 29:37.320]  but I want you to experience the power of the good halogen
[29:37.320 --> 29:39.360]  and learn about the iodine conspiracy.
[29:39.360 --> 29:41.680]  It's all available at infowarstore.com.
[29:41.680 --> 29:44.280]  The new green fiber capsules, 50% off,
[29:44.280 --> 29:48.120]  and X2 in the spray bottle and in the dropper bottle
[29:48.120 --> 29:51.400]  for 60 and 40% off, and it funds the infowar.
[29:51.400 --> 29:54.040]  Experience deeper crystal iodine for itself
[29:54.040 --> 29:56.760]  and keep your gut healthy at infowarstore.com.
[29:58.520 --> 30:01.120]  Bio remediation is a process used to treat
[30:01.120 --> 30:04.280]  contaminating water, soil, and subsurface material
[30:04.280 --> 30:06.600]  by accelerating naturally occurring environmental conditions
[30:06.600 --> 30:08.760]  to stimulate growth of microorganisms
[30:08.760 --> 30:10.600]  and degrade targeted pollutants.
[30:10.600 --> 30:13.120]  For the first time, the BioPros are bringing
[30:13.120 --> 30:16.320]  to the public market a suite of bio remediation products
[30:16.320 --> 30:17.640]  to the everyday consumer.
[30:17.640 --> 30:19.880]  Their first product they are launching is called
[30:19.880 --> 30:22.880]  BioSeptic Pro, a product specifically designed
[30:22.880 --> 30:24.840]  to establish a healthy septic system.
[30:24.840 --> 30:27.480]  BioSeptic Pro contains live microorganisms,
[30:27.480 --> 30:29.640]  not traditional enzymes like its competitors.
[30:29.640 --> 30:31.560]  This stuff lives in your septic system.
[30:31.560 --> 30:34.240]  It's really like probiotics or your septic tank
[30:34.240 --> 30:36.840]  and is at least 100 times more effective
[30:36.840 --> 30:38.760]  than similar microbial products
[30:38.760 --> 30:40.920]  due to its revolutionary patented delivery system.
[30:40.920 --> 30:43.840]  BioSeptic Pro contains no chemical ingredients
[30:43.840 --> 30:45.760]  and no genetically modified organisms.
[30:45.760 --> 30:49.880]  Visit thebiopros.com today and protect your septic system.
[30:49.880 --> 30:51.920]  That's thebiopros.com.
[30:51.920 --> 30:54.080]  This is for anaerobic septic tanks
[30:54.080 --> 30:56.080]  and the job it does is unparalleled.
[30:56.080 --> 30:57.680]  Thebiopros.com.
[30:57.680 --> 31:02.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[31:27.680 --> 31:32.680]  All right, folks.
[31:32.680 --> 31:33.680]  Welcome back.
[31:33.680 --> 31:37.680]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live Wednesday
[31:37.680 --> 31:40.680]  broadcast, July 14th.
[31:40.680 --> 31:43.680]  I am seriously having trouble doing the show.
[31:43.680 --> 31:45.680]  In fact, I think things are bad enough.
[31:45.680 --> 31:47.680]  I may just not do the show.
[31:47.680 --> 31:49.680]  I'm not going to do it.
[31:49.680 --> 31:51.680]  I'm not going to do it.
[31:51.680 --> 31:53.680]  I'm not going to do it.
[31:53.680 --> 31:55.680]  I'm not going to do it.
[31:55.680 --> 31:57.680]  Things are bad enough.
[31:57.680 --> 31:59.680]  I may just not do the show for a month
[31:59.680 --> 32:01.680]  and just walk out of here next segment
[32:01.680 --> 32:03.680]  and not come back for a while.
[32:03.680 --> 32:05.680]  Just to get everybody paying attention how serious it is,
[32:05.680 --> 32:07.680]  because just screaming and yelling up here
[32:07.680 --> 32:09.680]  and not doing anything, obviously.
[32:09.680 --> 32:11.680]  Because people don't get what they're being hit by,
[32:11.680 --> 32:13.680]  the end, the takeover, the post-industrial world,
[32:13.680 --> 32:17.680]  the forced depopulation of the planet.
[32:17.680 --> 32:21.680]  In fact, I have to.
[32:21.680 --> 32:23.680]  I cannot do this radio show
[32:23.680 --> 32:26.680]  and just sit up here and normalize everything.
[32:26.680 --> 32:29.680]  The party is over.
[32:32.680 --> 32:34.680]  I'm not wrong. I'm right.
[32:34.680 --> 32:36.680]  I told you every damn thing was going to happen,
[32:36.680 --> 32:38.680]  because I've got these murdering criminals
[32:38.680 --> 32:40.680]  planning it all out,
[32:40.680 --> 32:43.680]  and I've got all their damn documents right here.
[32:46.680 --> 32:48.680]  You think they're going to stop with the outrageous
[32:48.680 --> 32:51.680]  announcement that the Democratic Party
[32:51.680 --> 32:53.680]  is going to run telecoms
[32:53.680 --> 32:56.680]  and read all your text messages in live time
[32:56.680 --> 32:59.680]  and tell you what you can send and what you can't?
[32:59.680 --> 33:04.680]  I mean, if that ain't enough of a five-star raping,
[33:04.680 --> 33:07.680]  then what did Kathleen Sebelius,
[33:07.680 --> 33:09.680]  former head of Health and Human Services,
[33:09.680 --> 33:11.680]  under Obama come out and say,
[33:11.680 --> 33:13.680]  she said, we don't just want to make it tough on people.
[33:13.680 --> 33:16.680]  Don't take these deadly experimentally legal shots.
[33:16.680 --> 33:20.680]  We need to make sure they lose their job.
[33:20.680 --> 33:22.680]  Because they're nice liberals.
[33:22.680 --> 33:25.680]  They want to save us. They care so much about us.
[33:25.680 --> 33:27.680]  It's not an old person they couldn't kill or a baby
[33:27.680 --> 33:29.680]  they couldn't abort, but they love you now,
[33:29.680 --> 33:31.680]  just like Bill Gates does.
[33:31.680 --> 33:34.680]  She says they shouldn't have access to children,
[33:34.680 --> 33:38.680]  including their own children.
[33:38.680 --> 33:41.680]  When these are the people putting those dirty, filthy
[33:41.680 --> 33:45.680]  diapers on their faces that give them bacterial pneumonia,
[33:45.680 --> 33:47.680]  and then all these political whores
[33:47.680 --> 33:50.680]  sit up there and nod their heads, and I've got MSNBC
[33:50.680 --> 33:52.680]  reporters and CNN reporters saying,
[33:52.680 --> 33:55.680]  oh, I'm not inviting any family over to Thanksgiving.
[33:55.680 --> 33:57.680]  Doesn't have their vaccine passport.
[33:57.680 --> 33:59.680]  That's not a cult or anything.
[33:59.680 --> 34:01.680]  Oh, I've had my vaccine, which, by the way,
[34:01.680 --> 34:03.680]  I told you this was coming because it was all in the Bill Gates
[34:03.680 --> 34:06.680]  planet over a year ago.
[34:06.680 --> 34:12.680]  None of the vaccines have any value.
[34:12.680 --> 34:14.680]  They don't even protect you from COVID.
[34:14.680 --> 34:17.680]  They never could, and the scientists all said that.
[34:17.680 --> 34:19.680]  They're real virologists, but most people
[34:19.680 --> 34:21.680]  didn't get to hear from them because they were all
[34:21.680 --> 34:29.680]  censored in live time by big tech.
[34:29.680 --> 34:31.680]  And then you got all the weirdos that have signed
[34:31.680 --> 34:35.680]  on to this abomination.
[34:35.680 --> 34:37.680]  I want to give the number out specifically
[34:37.680 --> 34:42.680]  for first-time callers on operational considerations
[34:42.680 --> 34:45.680]  for community isolation centers, COVID-19,
[34:45.680 --> 34:46.680]  in low-resourced settings.
[34:46.680 --> 34:50.680]  That's just one CDC document from a year ago,
[34:50.680 --> 34:51.680]  and then a new one in March,
[34:51.680 --> 34:54.680]  re-updated March 18 this year about setting up
[34:54.680 --> 34:57.680]  these emergency centers all over the United States.
[34:57.680 --> 34:59.680]  The same ones they've set up in Canada and Australia
[34:59.680 --> 35:01.680]  and Europe and the same stuff going on.
[35:01.680 --> 35:03.680]  It's all being announced.
[35:03.680 --> 35:04.680]  Tucker talked about it back then.
[35:04.680 --> 35:08.680]  Tucker Carlson, COVID internment camps coming soon.
[35:08.680 --> 35:11.680]  Well, they're not coming soon now.
[35:11.680 --> 35:14.680]  They're here, ladies and gentlemen.
[35:14.680 --> 35:16.680]  And it's all UN run.
[35:16.680 --> 35:18.680]  You didn't think the UN would just show up with soldiers
[35:18.680 --> 35:20.680]  and say, we're here to take your guns,
[35:20.680 --> 35:22.680]  and you just, oh, here are my guns.
[35:22.680 --> 35:23.680]  That would start a civil war.
[35:23.680 --> 35:24.680]  They'd lose.
[35:24.680 --> 35:28.680]  It's an outside force.
[35:28.680 --> 35:30.680]  The traders and the patriots, we'd win.
[35:30.680 --> 35:32.680]  But if it's under a virus and under race war,
[35:32.680 --> 35:35.680]  and oh, the people that don't want to turn their guns in
[35:35.680 --> 35:36.680]  and take all these special shots,
[35:36.680 --> 35:38.680]  they're all secretly white supremacists.
[35:38.680 --> 35:40.680]  And, you know, we've got to arrest them and get them,
[35:40.680 --> 35:42.680]  and they're not safe, and you need to take your shots
[35:42.680 --> 35:45.680]  so you're safe, and we're just a medical group
[35:45.680 --> 35:48.680]  coming door to door to talk to you
[35:48.680 --> 35:51.680]  and see what's going on inside.
[35:51.680 --> 35:53.680]  It's all being rolled out.
[35:53.680 --> 35:54.680]  So at the very start of the show,
[35:54.680 --> 35:55.680]  some of you may have missed it,
[35:55.680 --> 35:58.680]  I aired a very powerful Gregory's report.
[35:58.680 --> 35:59.680]  All his reports are important.
[35:59.680 --> 36:00.680]  But this one's right up there at the top
[36:00.680 --> 36:02.680]  of his most important call.
[36:02.680 --> 36:05.680]  This is the end.
[36:05.680 --> 36:07.680]  If you don't wake up,
[36:07.680 --> 36:09.680]  because that's how incrementalism works.
[36:09.680 --> 36:11.680]  That's how successive approximation works.
[36:11.680 --> 36:13.680]  That's how the frog gets put in the pot,
[36:13.680 --> 36:15.680]  and it's slowly turned up.
[36:15.680 --> 36:17.680]  That psychology's all being employed.
[36:17.680 --> 36:19.680]  Well, finally, in the middle of 2021,
[36:19.680 --> 36:21.680]  it's we're reading all your text messages
[36:21.680 --> 36:22.680]  and they're going to censor them.
[36:22.680 --> 36:25.680]  The DNC, not just the NSA.
[36:25.680 --> 36:27.680]  Oh, but Tucker's crazy because he says he's being spot on.
[36:27.680 --> 36:28.680]  But we're spying on you.
[36:28.680 --> 36:29.680]  We're spying on all of you.
[36:29.680 --> 36:31.680]  And oh, yeah, we're going to put you in camps.
[36:31.680 --> 36:32.680]  And oh, yeah, the vaccine doesn't work.
[36:32.680 --> 36:37.680]  And that's killing a bunch of people, but big deal.
[36:37.680 --> 36:39.680]  Oh, illegal aliens coming across the border.
[36:39.680 --> 36:42.680]  They're exempt from all this.
[36:42.680 --> 36:44.680]  And they're triggering riots all over the world
[36:44.680 --> 36:45.680]  with the ongoing lockdown.
[36:45.680 --> 36:46.680]  So here's the report.
[36:46.680 --> 36:48.680]  We're going to come back and play Kathleen Sebelius
[36:48.680 --> 36:50.680]  and her declaration of war saying,
[36:50.680 --> 36:51.680]  you're going to be homeless on the street.
[36:51.680 --> 36:52.680]  Your children taken.
[36:52.680 --> 36:53.680]  If you don't let us put this in you,
[36:53.680 --> 37:02.680]  because we love you so much.
[37:02.680 --> 37:04.680]  As far as the public was concerned,
[37:04.680 --> 37:07.680]  the Nazis may have lost the war,
[37:07.680 --> 37:11.680]  but their ideology has continued to spread ever since.
[37:11.680 --> 37:14.680]  Following World War II came the United Nations,
[37:14.680 --> 37:17.680]  mass fluoridation of the water supply,
[37:17.680 --> 37:20.680]  the dumbing down of the education system,
[37:20.680 --> 37:23.680]  postmodernism, political correctness,
[37:23.680 --> 37:25.680]  and the war on drugs.
[37:25.680 --> 37:27.680]  For many, this has gone unnoticed.
[37:27.680 --> 37:31.680]  The Nazis became the pop culture model of fascism.
[37:31.680 --> 37:34.680]  Black leather and Jack Boots became the symbols
[37:34.680 --> 37:36.680]  of authoritarianism.
[37:36.680 --> 37:39.680]  Fascism could now hide itself behind a smile
[37:39.680 --> 37:41.680]  in a suit and a tie.
[37:41.680 --> 37:45.680]  The majority had no idea of the global fascist state
[37:45.680 --> 37:48.680]  being slowly installed behind the scenes.
[37:48.680 --> 37:50.680]  And now it's here.
[37:50.680 --> 37:53.680]  COVID was just the beginning of their end game.
[37:53.680 --> 37:56.680]  The same private corporations and NGOs
[37:56.680 --> 37:59.680]  that planned and executed the COVID hoax
[37:59.680 --> 38:02.680]  are now preparing the next phase.
[38:02.680 --> 38:05.680]  We can soon expect a massive cyber attack.
[38:05.680 --> 38:08.680]  We all know, but still,
[38:08.680 --> 38:11.680]  pay insufficient attention
[38:11.680 --> 38:14.680]  to the frightening scenario
[38:14.680 --> 38:17.680]  of a comprehensive cyber attack,
[38:17.680 --> 38:20.680]  which would bring to a complete halt
[38:20.680 --> 38:23.680]  to the power supply,
[38:23.680 --> 38:26.680]  transportation, hospital services.
[38:26.680 --> 38:29.680]  Our society as a whole.
[38:29.680 --> 38:32.680]  The COVID-19 crisis would be seen
[38:32.680 --> 38:36.680]  in this respect as a small disturbance
[38:36.680 --> 38:38.680]  in comparison.
[38:38.680 --> 38:40.680]  The World Economic Forum,
[38:40.680 --> 38:43.680]  who sponsored tabletop simulations for COVID
[38:43.680 --> 38:45.680]  just weeks before the outbreak,
[38:45.680 --> 38:48.680]  are now doing the same for cyber attacks,
[38:48.680 --> 38:51.680]  which will be the reset button needed
[38:51.680 --> 38:53.680]  for their great reset.
[38:53.680 --> 38:56.680]  And when the grid goes down,
[38:56.680 --> 38:59.680]  it will take banking and shipping down with it,
[38:59.680 --> 39:02.680]  killing millions in the overcrowded cities.
[39:02.680 --> 39:05.680]  Those with a survival instinct will leave the cities,
[39:05.680 --> 39:08.680]  which is why the Rural Domestic Preparedness Consortium,
[39:08.680 --> 39:11.680]  a part of Homeland Security and FEMA,
[39:11.680 --> 39:14.680]  is currently training for the isolation
[39:14.680 --> 39:17.680]  and quarantine of rural communities.
[39:17.680 --> 39:19.680]  After their great reset,
[39:19.680 --> 39:23.680]  we know how they plan to build back better.
[39:23.680 --> 39:25.680]  Two key agents of the great reset,
[39:25.680 --> 39:28.680]  Regina Dugan and Ken Gabriel,
[39:28.680 --> 39:30.680]  both worked for DARPA,
[39:30.680 --> 39:33.680]  Greenlit RNA Vaccine Research in 2012,
[39:33.680 --> 39:36.680]  and then went on to Google and Facebook,
[39:36.680 --> 39:39.680]  where they set up DARPA equivalents.
[39:39.680 --> 39:42.680]  In 2018, they joined Welcome Leap,
[39:42.680 --> 39:46.680]  founded by the world's richest medical research foundation.
[39:46.680 --> 39:50.680]  Their stated goal to be completed no later than 2030
[39:50.680 --> 39:54.680]  is to have 80% of all children under the age of three
[39:54.680 --> 39:57.680]  monitored 24-7 with wearable devices
[39:57.680 --> 40:00.680]  that will read their brain patterns,
[40:00.680 --> 40:03.680]  specifically focusing on keeping the individual
[40:03.680 --> 40:06.680]  motivated to work.
[40:06.680 --> 40:09.680]  They plan to have an in-silico model of a child's brain
[40:09.680 --> 40:11.680]  to be used as the model brain
[40:11.680 --> 40:14.680]  that all infants will be molded to
[40:14.680 --> 40:17.680]  via therapeutic interventions,
[40:17.680 --> 40:20.680]  like slaves in a dystopian sci-fi movie,
[40:20.680 --> 40:22.680]  except this is not a movie,
[40:22.680 --> 40:25.680]  and it's no longer a conspiracy theory.
[40:25.680 --> 40:27.680]  It's all happening.
[40:27.680 --> 40:30.680]  The entire world is under attack,
[40:30.680 --> 40:32.680]  with seemingly no pushback.
[40:32.680 --> 40:34.680]  And if we don't pushback,
[40:34.680 --> 40:36.680]  then it's all over,
[40:36.680 --> 40:40.680]  and we have nobody to blame but ourselves.
[40:40.680 --> 40:45.680]  For Infowars.com, this is Greg Rees.
[40:45.680 --> 40:47.680]  That's all real documents.
[40:47.680 --> 40:49.680]  They're going to take your children at birth,
[40:49.680 --> 40:52.680]  hook them into a face suit that programs them
[40:52.680 --> 40:55.680]  in a matrix-like system to be total slaves, these monsters.
[40:55.680 --> 40:58.680]  I never had a marketing plan for Infowars.
[40:58.680 --> 41:01.680]  I went out and found the best products I could find
[41:01.680 --> 41:03.680]  from the research to fund her operation.
[41:03.680 --> 41:06.680]  I wanted you to get products that empowered you that you loved,
[41:06.680 --> 41:08.680]  so you'd want to come back and buy more.
[41:08.680 --> 41:10.680]  You want to be treated. It's very, very simple.
[41:10.680 --> 41:12.680]  It's instinctive. It's spiritual. It's what I do.
[41:12.680 --> 41:15.680]  And that said, our iodine products have become our best sellers.
[41:15.680 --> 41:17.680]  And X2 right now is discounted
[41:17.680 --> 41:20.680]  because listeners and viewers are habituated
[41:20.680 --> 41:22.680]  to only buy it when it's on sale.
[41:22.680 --> 41:24.680]  And so I'm going to catch 22.
[41:24.680 --> 41:26.680]  When I don't have it on sale, I don't sell it.
[41:26.680 --> 41:28.680]  But we're selling out of all other products
[41:28.680 --> 41:30.680]  because of supply chain breakdowns.
[41:30.680 --> 41:32.680]  And so I'm going to catch 22.
[41:32.680 --> 41:34.680]  I need to sell products at full price, but I can't.
[41:34.680 --> 41:36.680]  I got to sell them at discount.
[41:36.680 --> 41:38.680]  It's 40% off for the dropper bottle,
[41:38.680 --> 41:40.680]  60% off for the spray bottle,
[41:40.680 --> 41:42.680]  even though it's about to sell out.
[41:42.680 --> 41:44.680]  It won't be available for months, so get it.
[41:44.680 --> 41:47.680]  X2 is selling out at InfowarsTour.com
[41:47.680 --> 41:50.680]  for 40% and 60% off with double-patriot points
[41:50.680 --> 41:52.680]  and free shipping because why?
[41:52.680 --> 41:53.680]  That's when you buy it.
[41:53.680 --> 41:55.680]  We need your funds or it'll be off air.
[41:55.680 --> 41:57.680]  It's an amazing product.
[41:57.680 --> 42:01.680]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown
[42:01.680 --> 42:06.680]  in vitality, energy and overall wellness.
[42:06.680 --> 42:10.680]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas
[42:10.680 --> 42:13.680]  to date, Super Male Vitality,
[42:13.680 --> 42:16.680]  specifically designed to assist the body
[42:16.680 --> 42:18.680]  in regulating proper balance
[42:18.680 --> 42:22.680]  to create superior vitality in males.
[42:22.680 --> 42:24.680]  Now look, this unique formula
[42:24.680 --> 42:27.680]  promotes your body's own natural responses
[42:27.680 --> 42:30.680]  and it contains no synthetic chemicals
[42:30.680 --> 42:33.680]  and no unwanted additives.
[42:33.680 --> 42:34.680]  Yes.
[42:34.680 --> 42:36.680]  We're talking about ancient wisdom
[42:36.680 --> 42:39.680]  combined with modern technology.
[42:39.680 --> 42:42.680]  Working together in perfect synchronicity
[42:42.680 --> 42:46.680]  to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[42:46.680 --> 42:47.680]  So what are you waiting for?
[42:47.680 --> 42:49.680]  Go to the Infowars Store.
[42:49.680 --> 42:51.680]  Never been a better time than right now.
[42:51.680 --> 42:53.680]  Super Male Vitality
[42:53.680 --> 43:00.680]  at InfowarsStore.com
[43:00.680 --> 43:02.680]  Jacob in Ohio, welcome, go ahead.
[43:02.680 --> 43:04.680]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[43:04.680 --> 43:05.680]  Great last caller.
[43:05.680 --> 43:08.680]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplements.
[43:08.680 --> 43:11.680]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore
[43:11.680 --> 43:14.680]  with all the gaslighting, the moralization and absurdity.
[43:14.680 --> 43:16.680]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone, man.
[43:16.680 --> 43:18.680]  All right, Eric's in New Hampshire.
[43:18.680 --> 43:19.680]  Eric, thanks for calling, go ahead.
[43:19.680 --> 43:21.680]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[43:21.680 --> 43:23.680]  I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out
[43:23.680 --> 43:24.680]  for one of the products.
[43:24.680 --> 43:26.680]  The XQ does wonders.
[43:26.680 --> 43:28.680]  I recommend it to everybody here on the fence about it.
[43:28.680 --> 43:31.680]  Get off the fence, get the product, support the Infowars.
[43:31.680 --> 43:33.680]  Tyler in Maine, you're on the year.
[43:33.680 --> 43:34.680]  Thanks for rolling, go ahead.
[43:34.680 --> 43:36.680]  Hey, Alex, it's great to be on with you.
[43:36.680 --> 43:37.680]  It's an honor.
[43:37.680 --> 43:38.680]  Honored to talk to you.
[43:38.680 --> 43:39.680]  Awesome.
[43:39.680 --> 43:42.680]  So, personally, I wanted to do is say I love the products.
[43:42.680 --> 43:44.680]  Alpha Power, even at 29.
[43:44.680 --> 43:46.680]  If you ask my better half, she loves it.
[43:46.680 --> 43:48.680]  And it helps in the bedroom.
[43:48.680 --> 43:50.680]  So just number one for a few years.
[43:50.680 --> 43:51.680]  It works.
[43:51.680 --> 43:52.680]  It's not a joke.
[43:52.680 --> 44:21.680]  Absolutely.
[44:21.680 --> 44:23.680]  We finally got them back in stock.
[44:23.680 --> 44:24.680]  The highest rated.
[44:24.680 --> 44:27.680]  They fit almost all types of androids and iPhones.
[44:27.680 --> 44:30.680]  And 50% off, $14.95.
[44:30.680 --> 44:33.680]  They sell these babies for $29.95 all day long.
[44:33.680 --> 44:38.680]  We've got a private label for the Infowars on them for $14.95.
[44:38.680 --> 44:40.680]  Because I want you to get them.
[44:40.680 --> 44:43.680]  And I want you to buy friends and family of these systems
[44:43.680 --> 44:46.680]  to educate them about what these, quote, smartphones really are.
[44:46.680 --> 44:49.680]  This is a great way to limit your phone time use.
[44:49.680 --> 44:51.680]  It's a great way to spend more time with your family.
[44:51.680 --> 44:53.680]  And it's a great way to know you're not being tracked
[44:53.680 --> 44:54.680]  by the criminal globalist system.
[44:54.680 --> 44:56.680]  They're 50% off right now.
[44:56.680 --> 44:59.680]  And at FullWarStore.com.
[44:59.680 --> 45:23.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[45:23.680 --> 45:33.680]  Alex Jones.
[45:33.680 --> 45:43.680]  Alex Jones.
[45:43.680 --> 46:03.680]  Alex Jones.
[46:03.680 --> 46:06.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, I want to give the phone number out
[46:06.680 --> 46:08.680]  in the second and third hour today.
[46:08.680 --> 46:10.680]  But I'll do that at the start of the next hour.
[46:10.680 --> 46:13.680]  And we'll take your phone calls.
[46:13.680 --> 46:18.680]  But it's almost a crime to just sit up here and cover all this
[46:18.680 --> 46:21.680]  in the middle of a war and just act like it's more political news.
[46:21.680 --> 46:25.680]  That's why I can't cover the Democrats all drunk on private jet airplanes
[46:25.680 --> 46:29.680]  leaving Texas to try to block your laws that stop their fraud.
[46:29.680 --> 46:32.680]  That's why it's hard to cover all this other incredibly interesting news
[46:32.680 --> 46:38.680]  because the big mothership, the big New World Order depopulation program
[46:38.680 --> 46:41.680]  is orchestrating all of this.
[46:41.680 --> 46:45.680]  And so we can fight all these little million battles all day long
[46:45.680 --> 46:50.680]  or we can wake up and arrest Bill Gates.
[46:50.680 --> 46:54.680]  We can stop Klaus Schwab.
[46:54.680 --> 47:01.680]  We can stop their puppet.
[47:01.680 --> 47:06.680]  So let me hear a couple of reports
[47:06.680 --> 47:08.680]  and check on something right now.
[47:08.680 --> 47:10.680]  Is he here?
[47:10.680 --> 47:12.680]  OK, just wanted to get that thing answered.
[47:12.680 --> 47:19.680]  I really appreciate that.
[47:19.680 --> 47:20.680]  You know what?
[47:20.680 --> 47:22.680]  I may just stop this.
[47:22.680 --> 47:23.680]  Absolutely.
[47:23.680 --> 47:24.680]  You know what?
[47:24.680 --> 47:25.680]  It's up to the public at this point.
[47:25.680 --> 47:26.680]  I'm going to rebroadcast.
[47:26.680 --> 47:27.680]  I'm leaving.
[47:27.680 --> 47:28.680]  You guys just knock yourselves out.
[47:28.680 --> 47:30.680]  Let's air them a bunch of clips of people saying they're slaves,
[47:30.680 --> 47:33.680]  got to stay in their houses, can't have access to children.
[47:33.680 --> 47:34.680]  Let's just play them a bunch of those.
[47:34.680 --> 47:35.680]  Let's just hear from the enemy.
[47:35.680 --> 47:39.680]  Let's have some, what do you call it here on air?
[47:39.680 --> 47:41.680]  What they want, the fairness doctrine.
[47:41.680 --> 47:45.680]  Let's have some fairness doctrine here on air.
[47:45.680 --> 47:48.680]  Got a bunch of those for you here.
[47:48.680 --> 47:54.680]  We got Sebelius, former head of health and human services,
[47:54.680 --> 47:56.680]  saying Americans should not be allowed to work,
[47:56.680 --> 47:59.680]  have access to children, including their children.
[47:59.680 --> 48:01.680]  Yeah, let's play folks clip six.
[48:01.680 --> 48:02.680]  Here it is.
[48:02.680 --> 48:04.680]  Well, it's horrifying.
[48:04.680 --> 48:08.680]  I don't know any cancer patient who, if they were offered a shot,
[48:08.680 --> 48:12.680]  that was 90% effective, wouldn't take it in a heartbeat.
[48:12.680 --> 48:18.680]  So we are in a situation where we have a wildly effective vaccine,
[48:18.680 --> 48:23.680]  multiple choices, lots available, free of charge,
[48:23.680 --> 48:27.680]  and we have folks who are just saying, I won't do it.
[48:27.680 --> 48:31.680]  I think that it's time to say to those folks, it's fine.
[48:31.680 --> 48:38.680]  If you don't choose to get vaccinated, you may not come to work.
[48:38.680 --> 48:43.680]  You may not have access to a situation where you're going to put
[48:43.680 --> 48:48.680]  my grandchildren in jeopardy, where you might kill them,
[48:48.680 --> 48:50.680]  where you might put them in a situation where they're going to
[48:50.680 --> 48:55.680]  carry the virus to someone in a high-risk position.
[48:55.680 --> 48:56.680]  That's, I think, the point.
[48:56.680 --> 48:58.680]  Shut that pig up.
[48:58.680 --> 49:00.680]  Shut that pig up.
[49:00.680 --> 49:04.680]  Hey, listen, you globalist pig, we all know you love death
[49:04.680 --> 49:06.680]  and aborting babies and killing old people,
[49:06.680 --> 49:09.680]  so shut your filthy, demonic, stinking mouth.
[49:09.680 --> 49:15.680]  Burn in hell.
[49:15.680 --> 49:17.680]  The damn vaccine isn't a vaccine.
[49:17.680 --> 49:20.680]  It's a gene therapy that makes your body attack its own proteins
[49:20.680 --> 49:23.680]  and give you autoimmune disorders and give you an excruciating,
[49:23.680 --> 49:25.680]  painful death.
[49:25.680 --> 49:30.680]  You murderous monster maggot.
[49:30.680 --> 49:33.680]  They're the ones killing people all over the world.
[49:33.680 --> 49:36.680]  They're the ones attacking us with this poison vaccine
[49:36.680 --> 49:39.680]  that skipped all the trials and all the tests,
[49:39.680 --> 49:49.680]  and now they put advisories all over the containers.
[49:49.680 --> 49:51.680]  Say, it can give you a heart attack.
[49:51.680 --> 49:54.680]  It can give you a stroke.
[49:54.680 --> 49:55.680]  It can give you blood clots.
[49:55.680 --> 50:00.680]  It can kill you, and all this pig can sit there and do
[50:00.680 --> 50:03.680]  and say, we're going to take your job or take your children
[50:03.680 --> 50:06.680]  or all you have access to children.
[50:06.680 --> 50:10.680]  You monster.
[50:10.680 --> 50:12.680]  I'm too pissed to even be on there.
[50:12.680 --> 50:14.680]  You know, there's a really good OAN report.
[50:14.680 --> 50:16.680]  I happened to see this morning when I was watching an OAN
[50:16.680 --> 50:20.680]  in my office, a DVR'd, where they've got Reuters
[50:20.680 --> 50:22.680]  and all these criminals.
[50:22.680 --> 50:24.680]  Turns out the head of Reuters is on the board,
[50:24.680 --> 50:27.680]  of course, of Pfizer, of course,
[50:27.680 --> 50:29.680]  and saying, oh, there's no death.
[50:29.680 --> 50:31.680]  The VAERS report's fake.
[50:31.680 --> 50:33.680]  It's all fake, even though it's medical doctors
[50:33.680 --> 50:35.680]  and nurses saying this is happening.
[50:35.680 --> 50:37.680]  And the same Reuters suppressing treatments
[50:37.680 --> 50:39.680]  because they want maximum death
[50:39.680 --> 50:43.680]  because they're just signed on to pure Satanism.
[50:43.680 --> 50:47.680]  We got that report.
[50:47.680 --> 50:51.680]  We got it all.
[50:51.680 --> 50:59.680]  Let me just do this.
[50:59.680 --> 51:06.680]  Let me just do this.
[51:06.680 --> 51:08.680]  I mean, what is the point of even selling products
[51:08.680 --> 51:10.680]  that stay on there?
[51:10.680 --> 51:11.680]  Probably not.
[51:11.680 --> 51:16.680]  I mean, here's why it should be on there.
[51:16.680 --> 51:18.680]  So I'm going to start saying a lot of really nasty mean stuff
[51:18.680 --> 51:21.680]  and I'm going to start really letting a lot of people have it
[51:21.680 --> 51:22.680]  and it's just not good to do.
[51:22.680 --> 51:23.680]  I'm just going to say this.
[51:23.680 --> 51:27.680]  Everybody needs to wake up and get out of your trance now.
[51:27.680 --> 51:30.680]  Wake up a little bit so you know what's happening to you
[51:30.680 --> 51:33.680]  so you understand, see?
[51:33.680 --> 51:35.680]  Because what I'm telling you is the truth.
[51:35.680 --> 51:39.680]  And scum like that chicken neck witch whore
[51:39.680 --> 51:42.680]  to the New World Order, Satan's little whore,
[51:42.680 --> 51:45.680]  sits up there and says he wants you to lose your job
[51:45.680 --> 51:48.680]  and live in a homeless camp or be put in a FEMA center
[51:48.680 --> 51:51.680]  because you don't take her murderous drug from the murderers
[51:51.680 --> 51:53.680]  at Pfizer and the murderers at Moderna
[51:53.680 --> 51:59.680]  and the murderer Bill Gates.
[51:59.680 --> 52:01.680]  And we all sit there like a bunch of cowards
[52:01.680 --> 52:03.680]  bowing down to the big banks
[52:03.680 --> 52:05.680]  and all their stolen trillions
[52:05.680 --> 52:07.680]  and bowing down to Big Pharma
[52:07.680 --> 52:10.680]  and bowing down to Fauci
[52:10.680 --> 52:13.680]  who can't even throw a baseball straight.
[52:13.680 --> 52:16.680]  He's an idiot.
[52:16.680 --> 52:18.680]  These people are nobodies.
[52:18.680 --> 52:22.680]  They are sacks of demonic filth that hate humanity
[52:22.680 --> 52:28.680]  that need to be brought to justice.
[52:28.680 --> 52:30.680]  All right, I'm going to control myself.
[52:30.680 --> 52:32.680]  I'm going to air a special report next segment
[52:32.680 --> 52:34.680]  and I probably should call Lowe and Shroy
[52:34.680 --> 52:36.680]  or get him in there because I told myself
[52:36.680 --> 52:38.680]  because when I get one of these rages I should not be on air
[52:38.680 --> 52:42.680]  because I say things that overall are truthful
[52:42.680 --> 52:45.680]  but not probably constructive in the end.
[52:45.680 --> 52:47.680]  But I just can't be around the trance anymore.
[52:47.680 --> 52:49.680]  I can't be around the undead, just all of it.
[52:49.680 --> 52:51.680]  I just have the unconsciousness to this.
[52:51.680 --> 52:54.680]  It's so obvious, it's ridiculous, it's pointless.
[52:54.680 --> 52:59.680]  But oh, here, let's just do this.
[52:59.680 --> 53:02.680]  I don't know what crazy moron
[53:02.680 --> 53:05.680]  in their right mind would listen to this show
[53:05.680 --> 53:07.680]  and see everything come through we're talking about
[53:07.680 --> 53:09.680]  and then think I'm BSing you about iodine
[53:09.680 --> 53:12.680]  or that I'm BSing you that we have the best deep earth crystal source iodine
[53:12.680 --> 53:14.680]  that is the complete opposite of the evil halogen
[53:14.680 --> 53:18.680]  that the globalist bombard you with in the fluoride family.
[53:18.680 --> 53:21.680]  And so yes, I sell products, ladies and gentlemen,
[53:21.680 --> 53:25.680]  that literally are amazing and that absolutely work
[53:25.680 --> 53:28.680]  and I see leftist articles making jokes about the things we sell,
[53:28.680 --> 53:31.680]  saying I sell worthless stuff because they said it.
[53:31.680 --> 53:34.680]  No, they're projecting they're worthless.
[53:34.680 --> 53:38.680]  Iodine is essential and that's a scientific fact
[53:38.680 --> 53:41.680]  and you die if you don't have it after several months
[53:41.680 --> 53:46.680]  and that's one reason most people are in a retarded haze
[53:46.680 --> 53:50.680]  is because they don't have iodine in their body.
[53:50.680 --> 53:56.680]  We have it in the spray bottle, the exact same iodine,
[53:56.680 --> 54:00.680]  basically it costs $12 a bottle, that is insane, that's cost.
[54:00.680 --> 54:04.680]  The dropper bottle is at 40% off
[54:04.680 --> 54:08.680]  and it's the same iodine, it's excellent, that funds our operation
[54:08.680 --> 54:11.680]  and maybe if I take a week off, I mean obviously I'm not going to quit.
[54:11.680 --> 54:16.680]  Here's what I'm saying, I can't sit here, I can't sit here
[54:16.680 --> 54:19.680]  and continue to play games with all this.
[54:19.680 --> 54:22.680]  I cannot sit here in the same position
[54:22.680 --> 54:24.680]  and then just talk about how these people are bad all day
[54:24.680 --> 54:26.680]  and I'm not planning something, I'm just saying
[54:26.680 --> 54:29.680]  they're planning something and they're attacking us
[54:29.680 --> 54:32.680]  and we can't just sit here like we're in normal times.
[54:32.680 --> 54:34.680]  We're not.
[54:34.680 --> 54:38.680]  Separately to all the jack off leftist cult members,
[54:38.680 --> 54:40.680]  they're like, oh you don't sell steak vitamins,
[54:40.680 --> 54:44.680]  oh you think green fiber capsules from wheatgrass
[54:44.680 --> 54:47.680]  and a bunch of other sprouts, the highest quality concentrated fiber
[54:47.680 --> 54:51.680]  with all of the major amino acids and all the essential amino acids
[54:51.680 --> 54:53.680]  and a whole bunch of vitamins and minerals is bad?
[54:53.680 --> 54:56.680]  No, you're bad, you're a liar, you're scum,
[54:56.680 --> 55:00.680]  you say a Pfizer deadly shot making me attack my own body,
[55:00.680 --> 55:04.680]  he's good, you little maggot and then you say I'm bad
[55:04.680 --> 55:08.680]  selling something that's life giving.
[55:08.680 --> 55:10.680]  Burnin' hell.
[55:10.680 --> 55:12.680]  Go research what's in our new product,
[55:12.680 --> 55:18.680]  50% off greens fiber capsules at infowarstore.com
[55:18.680 --> 55:23.680]  infowarstore.com
[55:23.680 --> 55:25.680]  There you go ladies and gentlemen
[55:25.680 --> 55:28.680]  and that funds this operation, please support our local stations
[55:28.680 --> 55:30.680]  and look, if I seem pissed off I am,
[55:30.680 --> 55:33.680]  we should be upset about what's going on.
[55:33.680 --> 55:35.680]  I haven't even hit any of these damn articles
[55:35.680 --> 55:37.680]  that pissed me off so much in all these video clips
[55:37.680 --> 55:39.680]  and your phone calls give the number up.
[55:39.680 --> 55:41.680]  Hour number two is coming up!
[55:46.680 --> 55:49.680]  Alex Jones here with two big announcements in the next 60 seconds.
[55:49.680 --> 55:52.680]  First off, green fiber capsules,
[55:52.680 --> 55:54.680]  highest quality fiber you're gonna find
[55:54.680 --> 55:57.680]  with all the amino acids and a ton of vitamins and minerals.
[55:57.680 --> 56:00.680]  This is an incredible formula, everybody should be taking it.
[56:00.680 --> 56:02.680]  Men, women, children, old, young, black, white,
[56:02.680 --> 56:04.680]  it doesn't matter, it's an amazing product,
[56:04.680 --> 56:07.680]  it's our newest product, it's 50% off out of the gates
[56:07.680 --> 56:09.680]  infowarstore.com.
[56:09.680 --> 56:12.680]  Then we have both types of X2s, the exact same X2 with a bottle,
[56:12.680 --> 56:14.680]  but one has a spray cap, one has a dropper cap
[56:14.680 --> 56:17.680]  for 60 and 40% off depending on which one,
[56:17.680 --> 56:19.680]  they're both excellent at infowarstore.com.
[56:19.680 --> 56:22.680]  The 60% off of the spray bottle is unprecedented
[56:22.680 --> 56:25.680]  but I want you to experience the power of the good halogen
[56:25.680 --> 56:27.680]  about the iodine conspiracy.
[56:27.680 --> 56:29.680]  It's all available at infowarstore.com.
[56:29.680 --> 56:33.680]  The new green fiber capsules, 50% off and X2 in the spray bottle
[56:33.680 --> 56:37.680]  and in the dropper bottle for 60 and 40% off.
[56:37.680 --> 56:39.680]  And it funds the infowar.
[56:39.680 --> 56:41.680]  Experience deeper crystal iodine for itself
[56:41.680 --> 56:44.680]  and keep your gut healthy at infowarstore.com.
[56:49.680 --> 56:51.680]  What are champions made of?
[56:51.680 --> 56:54.680]  Here's a man who can show you.
[57:21.680 --> 57:24.680]  That's infowarstore.com.
[57:51.680 --> 57:54.680]  Welcome to the Alex Jones show.
[58:21.680 --> 58:25.680]  I'm just, you know, that's all I could say.
[58:25.680 --> 58:28.680]  Here's a little bit of German TV on the 70 plus dead
[58:28.680 --> 58:32.680]  and that's a low number and the bedlam in South Africa
[58:32.680 --> 58:36.680]  and all the great reset destabilization that's not coming.
[58:36.680 --> 58:38.680]  It's already here. Here it is.
[58:38.680 --> 58:41.680]  Authorities in South Africa say that more than 70 people
[58:41.680 --> 58:43.680]  have been killed in some of the worst violence
[58:43.680 --> 58:45.680]  the country has seen in years.
[58:45.680 --> 58:48.680]  Stores and warehouses across the country have been looted
[58:48.680 --> 58:51.680]  and more than a thousand people have been arrested.
[58:51.680 --> 58:53.680]  The unrest erupted last week
[58:53.680 --> 58:55.680]  after former President Jacob Zuma
[58:55.680 --> 58:59.680]  began serving a prison sentence for contempt of court.
[59:01.680 --> 59:06.680]  This warehouse in Durban was ransacked by hundreds of people.
[59:06.680 --> 59:09.680]  The shelves emptied.
[59:09.680 --> 59:12.680]  The goods carried out in bulk.
[59:12.680 --> 59:16.680]  It is only one of dozens of malls, supermarkets
[59:16.680 --> 59:20.680]  and small shops that were targeted by looters
[59:20.680 --> 59:23.680]  like this party supplies shop in Soweto.
[59:23.680 --> 59:26.680]  It's over. It's over.
[59:26.680 --> 59:28.680]  It's got overhead.
[59:28.680 --> 59:31.680]  I owe banks money.
[59:31.680 --> 59:35.680]  How am I going to pay this one? With what?
[59:35.680 --> 59:38.680]  In some instances, armed local residents
[59:38.680 --> 59:42.680]  went after the looters themselves.
[59:42.680 --> 59:45.680]  The government sent soldiers to the most affected areas
[59:45.680 --> 59:48.680]  as police struggled to control the unrest.
[59:51.680 --> 59:55.680]  The current situation on the ground is under strong surveillance
[59:55.680 --> 1:00:01.680]  and we will ensure that it does not deter any further.
[1:00:01.680 --> 1:00:06.680]  We cannot allow anyone to make a mockery of our democratic state.
[1:00:06.680 --> 1:00:09.680]  The protest started last week
[1:00:09.680 --> 1:00:12.680]  after former South African President Jacob Zuma
[1:00:12.680 --> 1:00:15.680]  began serving a 15-month jail term.
[1:00:15.680 --> 1:00:17.680]  He was sentenced for contempt of court
[1:00:17.680 --> 1:00:21.680]  after refusing to appear at a corruption inquiry.
[1:00:21.680 --> 1:00:25.680]  The outrage of Zuma supporters was compounded by anger
[1:00:25.680 --> 1:00:30.680]  over persisting inequality and poverty in the country.
[1:00:32.680 --> 1:00:36.680]  And for more, let's cross over to D.W. correspondent Christine Wundwa
[1:00:36.680 --> 1:00:38.680]  who is standing by in Cape Town.
[1:00:38.680 --> 1:00:44.680]  What is the current situation in the country right now?
[1:00:44.680 --> 1:00:46.680]  Sarah, the looting continues.
[1:00:46.680 --> 1:00:49.680]  Overnight, more buildings were set alight.
[1:00:49.680 --> 1:00:53.680]  We know that the number of people arrested is well over 1,000.
[1:00:53.680 --> 1:00:58.680]  And we are receiving warnings now of looming food shortages
[1:00:58.680 --> 1:01:01.680]  because of the disruptions in Guazulunatal
[1:01:01.680 --> 1:01:03.680]  and halting these are key provinces
[1:01:03.680 --> 1:01:06.680]  when it comes to the supply of goods into the country.
[1:01:06.680 --> 1:01:08.680]  In many sites in these provinces,
[1:01:08.680 --> 1:01:10.680]  vaccine rollout has been affected.
[1:01:10.680 --> 1:01:13.680]  That is going to obviously have an impact
[1:01:13.680 --> 1:01:17.680]  on what already was a slow rollout of the vaccine here in South Africa.
[1:01:17.680 --> 1:01:20.680]  There is also concern about racial tensions flaring up now
[1:01:20.680 --> 1:01:24.680]  because of the lack of visibility when it comes to law enforcement.
[1:01:24.680 --> 1:01:28.680]  You now have armed citizens defending their property
[1:01:28.680 --> 1:01:31.680]  and in many cases it is fueling some racial tensions.
[1:01:31.680 --> 1:01:35.680]  People are also worried here about the outbreak of xenophobic violence
[1:01:35.680 --> 1:01:38.680]  because all sorts of criminality have now emerged
[1:01:38.680 --> 1:01:41.680]  from this violence and looting, Sarah.
[1:01:41.680 --> 1:01:43.680]  OK, so we are seeing criminality.
[1:01:43.680 --> 1:01:46.680]  By and large, Christine,
[1:01:46.680 --> 1:01:53.680]  who are these people that we are seeing, for example looting?
[1:01:53.680 --> 1:01:55.680]  Sarah, the people you will see looting
[1:01:55.680 --> 1:01:57.680]  are underprivileged South Africans for the most part.
[1:01:57.680 --> 1:01:59.680]  These are people who live in informal settlements
[1:01:59.680 --> 1:02:02.680]  who have been pushed further into poverty
[1:02:02.680 --> 1:02:05.680]  because of the pandemic and the restrictions that have come with it.
[1:02:05.680 --> 1:02:09.680]  And so what you are hearing from the officials in this country
[1:02:09.680 --> 1:02:12.680]  is that these people, their poverty is being exploited.
[1:02:12.680 --> 1:02:15.680]  In fact, those are the words of a senior ruling party official
[1:02:15.680 --> 1:02:17.680]  that the poverty of people was being exploited.
[1:02:17.680 --> 1:02:21.680]  But what authorities are now investigating is that these crowds,
[1:02:21.680 --> 1:02:26.680]  these mobs are being stoked and prompted by a more sinister third force
[1:02:26.680 --> 1:02:28.680]  because among the looters, among the people going in
[1:02:28.680 --> 1:02:31.680]  and stealing basic items like food and clothing,
[1:02:31.680 --> 1:02:34.680]  you have people lighting things up and setting things on fire
[1:02:34.680 --> 1:02:38.680]  who seem to want to be making destruction.
[1:02:38.680 --> 1:02:40.680]  And so these people are being investigated
[1:02:40.680 --> 1:02:44.680]  because it is believed, or at least reports have emerged,
[1:02:44.680 --> 1:02:46.680]  that there are some intelligence officials
[1:02:46.680 --> 1:02:49.680]  that are believed to be linked to the former President Jacob Zuma,
[1:02:49.680 --> 1:02:52.680]  who may be behind the stoking and mobilization of the crowds
[1:02:52.680 --> 1:02:54.680]  that you are seeing.
[1:02:54.680 --> 1:02:57.680]  The scientific dictatorship that I have been warning you about
[1:02:57.680 --> 1:03:01.680]  for 27 years has now gone from beta testing to operational.
[1:03:01.680 --> 1:03:03.680]  The globalists are out in the open
[1:03:03.680 --> 1:03:07.680]  with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot takeover.
[1:03:07.680 --> 1:03:10.680]  But the good news is we have been working and you have been working
[1:03:10.680 --> 1:03:12.680]  and others have been working across the planet for decades
[1:03:12.680 --> 1:03:15.680]  to get ready for this, to be able to find it off.
[1:03:15.680 --> 1:03:17.680]  Humanity is strong. We are incredible.
[1:03:17.680 --> 1:03:19.680]  And if we are aware of the attack that is happening,
[1:03:19.680 --> 1:03:21.680]  we have a real chance of defeating it.
[1:03:21.680 --> 1:03:23.680]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[1:03:23.680 --> 1:03:26.680]  So prayer is essential, research is essential,
[1:03:26.680 --> 1:03:28.680]  getting prepared is essential,
[1:03:28.680 --> 1:03:30.680]  and warning others is absolutely essential.
[1:03:30.680 --> 1:03:33.680]  And at the same time, supporting InfoWars
[1:03:33.680 --> 1:03:36.680]  by buying high-quality products to keep us on air is essential
[1:03:36.680 --> 1:03:38.680]  because they are great products for you and your family,

[1:03:57.680 --> 1:04:00.680]  The Christmas is coming to you.
[1:04:03.680 --> 1:04:06.680]  Waging work on corruption.
[1:04:06.680 --> 1:04:08.680]  All right, you are welcome.
[1:04:08.680 --> 1:04:11.680]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live
[1:04:11.680 --> 1:04:14.680]  from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[1:04:14.680 --> 1:04:16.680]  Alejandro Mayorkas,
[1:04:16.680 --> 1:04:19.680]  the head of the Department of Homeland Security
[1:04:19.680 --> 1:04:22.680]  who's oversaw the puppet president,
[1:04:22.680 --> 1:04:24.680]  the dictator, the pretender,
[1:04:24.680 --> 1:04:26.680]  in the last seven months
[1:04:26.680 --> 1:04:28.680]  looting and destroying our country
[1:04:28.680 --> 1:04:30.680]  and letting massive numbers,
[1:04:30.680 --> 1:04:32.680]  hundreds of thousands of smuggled children
[1:04:32.680 --> 1:04:34.680]  and millions of people total,
[1:04:34.680 --> 1:04:36.680]  he came out yesterday with an announcement
[1:04:36.680 --> 1:04:38.680]  that got almost no attention,
[1:04:38.680 --> 1:04:41.680]  but now the State Department has confirmed it.
[1:04:41.680 --> 1:04:43.680]  The DHS has confirmed it.
[1:04:43.680 --> 1:04:45.680]  If you're in Cuba,
[1:04:45.680 --> 1:04:47.680]  the National Communist Regime
[1:04:47.680 --> 1:04:49.680]  that puts you in jail for five years for protesting
[1:04:49.680 --> 1:04:51.680]  and will execute you if you do it a second time,
[1:04:51.680 --> 1:04:54.680]  Statue of Liberty isn't for you.
[1:04:54.680 --> 1:04:57.680]  Oh, you're actually a political dissident.
[1:04:57.680 --> 1:05:00.680]  You are not welcome here in America
[1:05:00.680 --> 1:05:02.680]  because you're right-wingers
[1:05:02.680 --> 1:05:05.680]  that have experienced that communism is a bad thing.
[1:05:05.680 --> 1:05:08.680]  Biden's DHS chief warned Cuban and Asian migrants
[1:05:08.680 --> 1:05:10.680]  not to come to the U.S.
[1:05:10.680 --> 1:05:13.680]  If you take the C, you will not come.
[1:05:13.680 --> 1:05:16.680]  And so here is a clip,
[1:05:16.680 --> 1:05:19.680]  particularly, he didn't say this earlier today,
[1:05:19.680 --> 1:05:21.680]  and he's saying this now to the Cubans
[1:05:21.680 --> 1:05:24.680]  that are 90 miles away and 70 miles from the Keys.
[1:05:24.680 --> 1:05:26.680]  Do not come,
[1:05:26.680 --> 1:05:28.680]  because you're really a political dissident
[1:05:28.680 --> 1:05:30.680]  and we don't want you here.
[1:05:30.680 --> 1:05:32.680]  We love Fidel Castro.
[1:05:32.680 --> 1:05:34.680]  We, to be clear,
[1:05:34.680 --> 1:05:37.680]  if you take to the C,
[1:05:37.680 --> 1:05:40.680]  you will not come to the United States.
[1:05:40.680 --> 1:05:42.680]  The time is never right
[1:05:42.680 --> 1:05:45.680]  to attempt migration by C.
[1:05:45.680 --> 1:05:48.680]  To those who risk their lives doing so,
[1:05:48.680 --> 1:05:51.680]  this risk is not worth taking.
[1:05:51.680 --> 1:05:54.680]  Again, I repeat,
[1:05:54.680 --> 1:05:56.680]  do not risk your life attempting
[1:05:56.680 --> 1:05:59.680]  to enter the United States illegally.
[1:05:59.680 --> 1:06:02.680]  Oh, but
[1:06:02.680 --> 1:06:05.680]  all the boats coming in from other places are fine
[1:06:05.680 --> 1:06:07.680]  and normal Haitian boats are fine
[1:06:07.680 --> 1:06:10.680]  and Mexican boats are fine, just not Cuban boats,
[1:06:10.680 --> 1:06:12.680]  ladies and gentlemen.
[1:06:12.680 --> 1:06:15.680]  Just like it came out that polls
[1:06:15.680 --> 1:06:18.680]  that try to come to the U.S. are like 75% Republican,
[1:06:18.680 --> 1:06:20.680]  so suddenly the Democrats, oh no, no, no,
[1:06:20.680 --> 1:06:22.680]  if you're Polish, you can't come here,
[1:06:22.680 --> 1:06:24.680]  because if you're not the color of your skin,
[1:06:24.680 --> 1:06:28.680]  you're political
[1:06:28.680 --> 1:06:31.680]  proclivity.
[1:06:31.680 --> 1:06:33.680]  What you're for.
[1:06:33.680 --> 1:06:35.680]  So it never ends, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:06:35.680 --> 1:06:37.680]  and they want to put us under the exact same thing,
[1:06:37.680 --> 1:06:39.680]  so here's the deal.
[1:06:39.680 --> 1:06:41.680]  I want to open the phones up here
[1:06:41.680 --> 1:06:44.680]  on a host of issues, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:06:44.680 --> 1:06:47.680]  I want to open the phones up on a string of issues.
[1:06:54.680 --> 1:06:56.680]  But I want to talk about those specifically.
[1:06:56.680 --> 1:06:59.680]  What do you make of Biden preparing
[1:06:59.680 --> 1:07:01.680]  emergency quarantine centers
[1:07:01.680 --> 1:07:04.680]  saying, oh, these deadly variants are there
[1:07:04.680 --> 1:07:06.680]  heating up all the same propaganda,
[1:07:06.680 --> 1:07:09.680]  saying a lockdown is going to be announced in the fall.
[1:07:09.680 --> 1:07:12.680]  I've got their statements here, I'm going to cover it.
[1:07:12.680 --> 1:07:18.680]  And CDC operational considerations
[1:07:18.680 --> 1:07:22.680]  for community isolation centers for COVID-19,
[1:07:22.680 --> 1:07:25.680]  and all the documents that deal with that,
[1:07:25.680 --> 1:07:27.680]  and the fact that they're coming to your houses,
[1:07:27.680 --> 1:07:29.680]  they're knocking on your doors,
[1:07:29.680 --> 1:07:32.680]  they're trying to identify who's been injected,
[1:07:32.680 --> 1:07:35.680]  who hasn't, even though they admit the vaccine doesn't protect you
[1:07:35.680 --> 1:07:37.680]  and now they want a new booster shot,
[1:07:37.680 --> 1:07:40.680]  because it didn't work six months in.
[1:07:40.680 --> 1:07:44.680]  What an incredible fraud we've gotten caught in.
[1:07:44.680 --> 1:07:48.680]  And now, the next level of censorship,
[1:07:48.680 --> 1:07:53.680]  Twitter Disabled's likes on misleading tweets.
[1:07:53.680 --> 1:07:56.680]  Evolutionary biologists, the one that's been banned,
[1:07:56.680 --> 1:07:58.680]  the one that went on Joe Rogan,
[1:07:58.680 --> 1:08:02.680]  was simply retweeting people saying,
[1:08:02.680 --> 1:08:04.680]  I don't want COVID-19 passports,
[1:08:04.680 --> 1:08:08.680]  I don't want this World ID.
[1:08:08.680 --> 1:08:10.680]  That's scientific disinfo.
[1:08:10.680 --> 1:08:13.680]  Not wanting Klaus Schwab's UN
[1:08:13.680 --> 1:08:15.680]  global social credit score controlling system.
[1:08:15.680 --> 1:08:17.680]  Not wanting the vaccine passport.
[1:08:17.680 --> 1:08:19.680]  That's not allowed.
[1:08:19.680 --> 1:08:20.680]  They said it, Twitter said.
[1:08:20.680 --> 1:08:24.680]  We've got shots of the screenshots.
[1:08:24.680 --> 1:08:27.680]  You're not allowed to not want this.
[1:08:27.680 --> 1:08:30.680]  Political repression, just like you see in Cuba or North Korea.
[1:08:30.680 --> 1:08:32.680]  Next level of censorship,
[1:08:32.680 --> 1:08:35.680]  Twitter Disabled's likes on misleading tweets.
[1:08:35.680 --> 1:08:38.680]  A message shared by the managing director of the field capital,
[1:08:38.680 --> 1:08:43.680]  Eric Weinstein, shows Twitter is blocking users
[1:08:43.680 --> 1:08:46.680]  from interacting with tweets deemed misleading.
[1:08:46.680 --> 1:08:49.680]  They go on to say the tweets,
[1:08:49.680 --> 1:08:51.680]  evidently the original offending tweet,
[1:08:51.680 --> 1:08:54.680]  was merely someone relating their opinion
[1:08:54.680 --> 1:08:56.680]  on vaccine passports and vaccine lockdowns.
[1:08:56.680 --> 1:09:01.680]  Well, you don't do that.
[1:09:01.680 --> 1:09:03.680]  See why I get so pissed?
[1:09:03.680 --> 1:09:05.680]  I read all this stuff.
[1:09:05.680 --> 1:09:07.680]  I don't just have these articles out here
[1:09:07.680 --> 1:09:09.680]  to impress you with a number of them.
[1:09:09.680 --> 1:09:11.680]  I mean, we open these up, I've got them all read.
[1:09:11.680 --> 1:09:13.680]  That's why I'm so pissed.
[1:09:13.680 --> 1:09:15.680]  Watching in slow motion the takeover.
[1:09:15.680 --> 1:09:17.680]  Look at this one.
[1:09:17.680 --> 1:09:19.680]  Father warns the world,
[1:09:19.680 --> 1:09:21.680]  17-year-old son diagnosed with heart condition
[1:09:21.680 --> 1:09:23.680]  after COVID-19 required vaccine,
[1:09:23.680 --> 1:09:25.680]  not a vaccine.
[1:09:25.680 --> 1:09:29.680]  Democrat group plans to fact check private SMS messages,
[1:09:29.680 --> 1:09:31.680]  your tech messages.
[1:09:31.680 --> 1:09:33.680]  That was just yesterday's news.
[1:09:33.680 --> 1:09:35.680]  British government will have to force people to eat
[1:09:35.680 --> 1:09:38.680]  less red meat to save us from climate change.
[1:09:38.680 --> 1:09:40.680]  Oh, I thought they said that wasn't true.
[1:09:40.680 --> 1:09:42.680]  John McAfee's wife's plain Spanish authorities
[1:09:42.680 --> 1:09:48.680]  are overseeing a cover-up of his death.
[1:09:48.680 --> 1:09:51.680]  Cover-up of his death.
[1:09:51.680 --> 1:09:53.680]  And when we come back from break,
[1:09:53.680 --> 1:09:55.680]  I'm going to give the number out right now.
[1:09:55.680 --> 1:09:57.680]  We got the video for you.
[1:09:57.680 --> 1:09:59.680]  It has begun.
[1:09:59.680 --> 1:10:05.680]  Door-to-door vaccine pushers hit the streets.
[1:10:05.680 --> 1:10:07.680]  And what is the answer to that?
[1:10:07.680 --> 1:10:09.680]  We'll cover it all.
[1:10:09.680 --> 1:10:12.680]  But whatever you see in Spain or in Australia
[1:10:12.680 --> 1:10:16.680]  or in the U.K. or in Canada or in France
[1:10:16.680 --> 1:10:19.680]  is the U.N. same policies.
[1:10:19.680 --> 1:10:24.680]  That's why yesterday the U.K.,
[1:10:24.680 --> 1:10:29.680]  and France all announced mandatory COVID-19 passports
[1:10:29.680 --> 1:10:32.680]  when they always promised, oh, that'll never happen.
[1:10:32.680 --> 1:10:34.680]  Don't form any opposition to us.
[1:10:34.680 --> 1:10:36.680]  It'll never happen.
[1:10:36.680 --> 1:10:39.680]  Let us gaslight, gaslight, gaslight, gaslight, gaslight.
[1:10:39.680 --> 1:10:41.680]  None of that's happening. None of that's going on.
[1:10:41.680 --> 1:10:43.680]  Go back to sleep. No, no, no, no.
[1:10:43.680 --> 1:10:45.680]  Oh, yeah, here it is.
[1:10:45.680 --> 1:10:48.680]  Ha-ha!
[1:10:52.680 --> 1:10:55.680]  The toll-free number to join us
[1:10:55.680 --> 1:10:57.680]  on everybody else can come here.
[1:10:57.680 --> 1:11:00.680]  Who isn't political dissidents will pay for everything for you.
[1:11:00.680 --> 1:11:02.680]  But if you're Cuban, you can't come here.
[1:11:02.680 --> 1:11:04.680]  What's your take on that?
[1:11:04.680 --> 1:11:06.680]  What's your take on, oh, yeah, we have another lockdown
[1:11:06.680 --> 1:11:08.680]  and we've got emergency quarantine centers ready
[1:11:08.680 --> 1:11:10.680]  and all the federal training documents,
[1:11:10.680 --> 1:11:12.680]  how they're preparing to lock up your towns
[1:11:12.680 --> 1:11:14.680]  and lock down your cities and not let you get in your cars.
[1:11:14.680 --> 1:11:16.680]  We've had the training wheels before.
[1:11:16.680 --> 1:11:18.680]  Let's see the psychology as well.
[1:11:18.680 --> 1:11:20.680]  Put up with it. They'll take it off next time.
[1:11:20.680 --> 1:11:22.680]  But see, they don't take it off.
[1:11:22.680 --> 1:11:24.680]  Or maybe they partially take it off the next time
[1:11:24.680 --> 1:11:26.680]  and then the next time don't.
[1:11:26.680 --> 1:11:28.680]  See the psychological training? Get it?
[1:11:28.680 --> 1:11:30.680]  Get it?
[1:11:30.680 --> 1:11:32.680]  Better get involved, better get aggressive,
[1:11:32.680 --> 1:11:35.680]  better prepare because it's on
[1:11:35.680 --> 1:11:38.680]  877-789-2539.
[1:11:38.680 --> 1:11:43.680]  First-time callers, 877-789-2539-877-789.
[1:11:43.680 --> 1:11:47.680]  Alex, 877-789-2539.
[1:11:47.680 --> 1:11:50.680]  Now, right now,
[1:11:50.680 --> 1:11:54.680]  let's talk about what we can do with our own bodies.
[1:11:54.680 --> 1:11:57.680]  Let's talk about what we can do with our own bodies
[1:11:57.680 --> 1:12:00.680]  with things that God has given us
[1:12:00.680 --> 1:12:02.680]  in this crazy world
[1:12:02.680 --> 1:12:04.680]  and all the things that globalists are doing.
[1:12:04.680 --> 1:12:06.680]  We've sought out to not just give you the most
[1:12:06.680 --> 1:12:08.680]  hardcore info and unfiltered
[1:12:08.680 --> 1:12:10.680]  with savage human energy
[1:12:10.680 --> 1:12:12.680]  to activate the resistance,
[1:12:12.680 --> 1:12:14.680]  to bring you the products that do that as well
[1:12:14.680 --> 1:12:16.680]  that don't just help your body,
[1:12:16.680 --> 1:12:17.680]  but you know,
[1:12:17.680 --> 1:12:20.680]  fund an operation you can see with your own eyeballs
[1:12:20.680 --> 1:12:22.680]  who is creating the counter-narrative
[1:12:22.680 --> 1:12:25.680]  and the talking points against the entire
[1:12:25.680 --> 1:12:27.680]  Satanic Great Reset
[1:12:27.680 --> 1:12:30.680]  New World Order Abomination.
[1:12:30.680 --> 1:12:33.680]  Oh, glory goes to Christ.
[1:12:33.680 --> 1:12:36.680]  We've got green fiber capsules
[1:12:36.680 --> 1:12:38.680]  and the name fiber is great, we named it that,
[1:12:38.680 --> 1:12:40.680]  but fiber is the side issue.
[1:12:40.680 --> 1:12:43.680]  This is an amino acid, all the essential amino acids and more.
[1:12:43.680 --> 1:12:46.680]  A bunch of vitamins and minerals in organic, natural form
[1:12:46.680 --> 1:12:49.680]  concentrated one of the best
[1:12:49.680 --> 1:12:52.680]  natural green formulas you're going to find.
[1:12:52.680 --> 1:12:54.680]  Is it the best in the world? I don't know.
[1:12:54.680 --> 1:12:56.680]  I know it's super high-end.
[1:12:56.680 --> 1:12:59.680]  I'm not omnipresent like God,
[1:12:59.680 --> 1:13:01.680]  but I know I could have put this out
[1:13:01.680 --> 1:13:03.680]  for eight times less than I put it out.
[1:13:03.680 --> 1:13:06.680]  I know that I went and found a top producer
[1:13:06.680 --> 1:13:09.680]  that would put us out.
[1:13:09.680 --> 1:13:12.680]  They believed is the strongest concentrated
[1:13:12.680 --> 1:13:15.680]  amino acid vitamin mineral supercharge
[1:13:15.680 --> 1:13:17.680]  from not just wheatgrass,
[1:13:17.680 --> 1:13:19.680]  but a bunch of other sprouts.
[1:13:19.680 --> 1:13:22.680]  This isn't a bunch of concentrated, ground-up cabbage
[1:13:22.680 --> 1:13:24.680]  that still flushes your guts out, it's great.
[1:13:24.680 --> 1:13:27.680]  This is all of these amazing products
[1:13:27.680 --> 1:13:29.680]  at M4warstore.com.
[1:13:29.680 --> 1:13:31.680]  It's 50% off, it's our new product,
[1:13:31.680 --> 1:13:33.680]  and we've got our iodine
[1:13:33.680 --> 1:13:35.680]  Deeper crystal X2 of the spray bottle

[1:13:37.680 --> 1:13:39.680]  same size bottle for 40% off,
[1:13:39.680 --> 1:13:41.680]  and it's going to sell out,
[1:13:41.680 --> 1:13:43.680]  but I got to get the funding in so it doesn't matter.
[1:13:43.680 --> 1:13:45.680]  We're going to finish the race here.
[1:13:45.680 --> 1:13:47.680]  So we're selling stuff, some of it, at cost,
[1:13:47.680 --> 1:13:49.680]  like this X2, because I got to get the funds in now.
[1:13:49.680 --> 1:13:51.680]  Take advantage of it, take action.
[1:13:56.680 --> 1:13:58.680]  Your voice counts.

[1:14:01.680 --> 1:14:03.680]  or in person, it changes the world.
[1:14:03.680 --> 1:14:06.680]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[1:14:06.680 --> 1:14:08.680]  They know you're angry.
[1:14:08.680 --> 1:14:10.680]  And now to get around big tech,
[1:14:10.680 --> 1:14:13.680]  it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.

[1:14:54.680 --> 1:14:56.680]  Experts agree that getting proper sleep
[1:14:56.680 --> 1:14:58.680]  is the cornerstone of good health.
[1:14:58.680 --> 1:15:00.680]  It has been proven that a poor sleep schedule
[1:15:00.680 --> 1:15:02.680]  is linked with numerous health problems
[1:15:02.680 --> 1:15:05.680]  including weight gain, memory issues, mood changes,
[1:15:05.680 --> 1:15:08.680]  poor concentration, and even a weakened immune system.
[1:15:08.680 --> 1:15:10.680]  Introducing RocketRest,
[1:15:10.680 --> 1:15:13.680]  the new product from our Dr. Jones Naturals line
[1:15:13.680 --> 1:15:15.680]  at infowarstore.com.
[1:15:15.680 --> 1:15:17.680]  The new RocketRest formula is loaded

[1:15:21.680 --> 1:15:23.680]  but help you wake up feeling refreshed.
[1:15:23.680 --> 1:15:25.680]  Many competitor sleep formulas
[1:15:25.680 --> 1:15:27.680]  focus only on getting you to sleep,
[1:15:27.680 --> 1:15:29.680]  but RocketRest was specifically formulated
[1:15:29.680 --> 1:15:33.680]  to help you feel rested and ready to take on the next day.
[1:15:33.680 --> 1:15:36.680]  It uses a unique quick release capsule system
[1:15:36.680 --> 1:15:39.680]  to ensure fast delivery of deep sleep support ingredients
[1:15:39.680 --> 1:15:41.680]  like melatonin and magnesium.
[1:15:41.680 --> 1:15:43.680]  RocketRest helps you fall asleep fast,
[1:15:43.680 --> 1:15:45.680]  stay asleep, and wake up feeling rested.
[1:15:45.680 --> 1:15:47.680]  So get the new RocketRest formula
[1:15:47.680 --> 1:15:49.680]  from Dr. Jones Naturals right now
[1:15:49.680 --> 1:15:52.680]  at infowarstore.com.
[1:15:53.680 --> 1:15:55.680]  The world is awakening.
[1:15:55.680 --> 1:15:57.680]  The world is beginning to understand
[1:15:57.680 --> 1:15:59.680]  the globalist paradigm.
[1:15:59.680 --> 1:16:01.680]  They are discovering the globalist,
[1:16:01.680 --> 1:16:03.680]  the elites, the manipulation, the CFR,
[1:16:03.680 --> 1:16:05.680]  the trilateral commission,
[1:16:05.680 --> 1:16:07.680]  the Bilderberg group, the Bohemian Grove,
[1:16:07.680 --> 1:16:09.680]  the Club of Rome.
[1:16:09.680 --> 1:16:11.680]  And so, even though it seems like
[1:16:11.680 --> 1:16:13.680]  the globalists are winning,
[1:16:13.680 --> 1:16:16.680]  the truth is they've had to come out of the open
[1:16:16.680 --> 1:16:18.680]  to attack human freedom
[1:16:18.680 --> 1:16:20.680]  because they're actually losing.
[1:16:20.680 --> 1:16:23.680]  We have forced them out in the open.
[1:16:23.680 --> 1:16:25.680]  So as bad as these times are,
[1:16:25.680 --> 1:16:27.680]  and a lot of negative things are about to happen,
[1:16:27.680 --> 1:16:29.680]  realize humanity is winning.
[1:16:29.680 --> 1:16:31.680]  You've got to trust in the plan of God
[1:16:31.680 --> 1:16:34.680]  and trust in the plan of God's justice.
[1:16:34.680 --> 1:16:36.680]  That is invincible.
[1:16:36.680 --> 1:16:39.680]  That is ethereal, timeless, and unstoppable.
[1:16:39.680 --> 1:16:41.680]  So don't trust in man, trust in God,
[1:16:41.680 --> 1:16:43.680]  to lead God and direct your soul,
[1:16:43.680 --> 1:16:45.680]  and then take action against the globalists
[1:16:45.680 --> 1:16:47.680]  and realize you've got my commitment from Alex Jones
[1:16:47.680 --> 1:16:49.680]  and my crew to you.
[1:16:49.680 --> 1:16:51.680]  We will never back down from the globalists
[1:16:51.680 --> 1:16:56.680]  and we will never surrender.
[1:16:56.680 --> 1:17:25.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:17:25.680 --> 1:17:27.680]  It's getting a vaccine virtually effortless.
[1:17:27.680 --> 1:17:29.680]  Community outreach groups have been
[1:17:29.680 --> 1:17:31.680]  canvassing specific neighborhoods for a few months now,
[1:17:31.680 --> 1:17:34.680]  educating and encouraging people to get the shot.
[1:17:34.680 --> 1:17:36.680]  Today, it got a lot easier.
[1:17:36.680 --> 1:17:39.680]  Health Department workers were giving the shot on the spot.
[1:17:39.680 --> 1:17:42.680]  WCNC Charlotte's Chloe Leschner is live in West Charlotte.
[1:17:42.680 --> 1:17:45.680]  Chloe, does this canvassing work?
[1:17:45.680 --> 1:17:47.680]  Fred, the county thinks it does,
[1:17:47.680 --> 1:17:49.680]  which is why they are expanding this program.
[1:17:49.680 --> 1:17:53.680]  ActionNC has knocked on 35,000 doors since May,
[1:17:53.680 --> 1:17:56.680]  and up until today, their only goal was to listen
[1:17:56.680 --> 1:17:58.680]  and dispel false information.
[1:17:58.680 --> 1:18:01.680]  But a lot of times, they are able to encourage people
[1:18:01.680 --> 1:18:03.680]  to get vaccinated, so now they can guarantee
[1:18:03.680 --> 1:18:06.680]  that it gets done.
[1:18:06.680 --> 1:18:09.680]  We'll be mindful about the COVID-19 vaccination.
[1:18:09.680 --> 1:18:12.680]  It's public health at work.
[1:18:12.680 --> 1:18:15.680]  Community outreach groups going door to door.
[1:18:15.680 --> 1:18:16.680]  Have you had yours yet?
[1:18:16.680 --> 1:18:19.680]  To have personal conversations about the COVID vaccine.
[1:18:19.680 --> 1:18:21.680]  We get people that will say,
[1:18:21.680 --> 1:18:24.680]  I'll get the shot, but the follow-up has always been the issue.
[1:18:24.680 --> 1:18:25.680]  Will they go?
[1:18:25.680 --> 1:18:27.680]  How can we get people to go out and go?
[1:18:27.680 --> 1:18:29.680]  Now, the health department is close by
[1:18:29.680 --> 1:18:31.680]  so they can offer the shots on demand.
[1:18:31.680 --> 1:18:34.680]  Now that the health department is actually coming out with us,
[1:18:34.680 --> 1:18:36.680]  we missed that middle step now.
[1:18:36.680 --> 1:18:38.680]  So now, would you like to get a shot?
[1:18:38.680 --> 1:18:39.680]  Yes.
[1:18:39.680 --> 1:18:41.680]  We've got somebody right here on site.
[1:18:41.680 --> 1:18:44.680]  In the first few hours of the New Doses to Doors program,
[1:18:44.680 --> 1:18:47.680]  four people in this West Charlotte neighborhood
[1:18:47.680 --> 1:18:50.680]  decided to get the shot right on their front porch.
[1:18:50.680 --> 1:18:52.680]  That eliminates any excuse.
[1:18:52.680 --> 1:18:54.680]  You don't have to drive anywhere and sit in line.
[1:18:54.680 --> 1:18:55.680]  You don't have to have a vehicle.
[1:18:55.680 --> 1:18:56.680]  You don't need to over.
[1:18:56.680 --> 1:18:58.680]  They are right here.
[1:18:58.680 --> 1:19:00.680]  The county primarily focused on neighborhoods
[1:19:00.680 --> 1:19:03.680]  with lower vaccination rates and communities that are hesitant,
[1:19:03.680 --> 1:19:06.680]  but have also been disproportionately impacted by COVID.
[1:19:06.680 --> 1:19:10.680]  You'll see the majority of the crew is African-American or Latinx
[1:19:10.680 --> 1:19:14.680]  because it's hard for people to find commonality
[1:19:14.680 --> 1:19:18.680]  as a subject if they don't see themselves in it.
[1:19:18.680 --> 1:19:23.680]  In an important note, they're really not being forceful at all.
[1:19:23.680 --> 1:19:27.680]  The health department only comes up if the person says that they want the shot.
[1:19:27.680 --> 1:19:31.680]  And we did see a handful of people today say they still weren't interested.
[1:19:31.680 --> 1:19:35.680]  So those volunteers really just working to understand why that is.
[1:19:35.680 --> 1:19:40.680]  But coming up at six, we will hear from somebody who did get vaccinated here today.
[1:19:40.680 --> 1:19:43.680]  For now, live in Charlotte, Chloe Lushner, WCNC Charlotte.
[1:19:43.680 --> 1:19:45.680]  Oh yeah, a little bit south there.
[1:19:45.680 --> 1:19:47.680]  They shot the black folks up with syphilis.
[1:19:47.680 --> 1:19:51.680]  And, you know, I get it.
[1:19:51.680 --> 1:19:53.680]  They've made people poor. They've done them down.
[1:19:53.680 --> 1:19:56.680]  Why don't we just go ahead and kill them?
[1:19:56.680 --> 1:19:58.680]  I don't care if they're poor black people, poor white people.
[1:19:58.680 --> 1:20:01.680]  I'm not going to sit around and do this to them.
[1:20:01.680 --> 1:20:04.680]  And you get all these useful idiots,
[1:20:04.680 --> 1:20:08.680]  like the black anchor man, the cute, you know, trendy girl, the green dress.
[1:20:08.680 --> 1:20:13.680]  Oh, trust us. Oh, look, we got black people and Latina girls
[1:20:13.680 --> 1:20:17.680]  here to give you this shot made by Bill Gates and some factory
[1:20:17.680 --> 1:20:20.680]  that they wouldn't even tell you what the ingredients are that's super secret.
[1:20:20.680 --> 1:20:24.680]  Then we get the ingredients. It's the entire jellyfish genome.
[1:20:24.680 --> 1:20:27.680]  And then a dead kid from 1966.
[1:20:27.680 --> 1:20:31.680]  We go, hey, hey, top scientist say this will attack your own body.
[1:20:31.680 --> 1:20:35.680]  It attacks a protein. Oh, shut up.
[1:20:35.680 --> 1:20:37.680]  Shut up. Oh, you heard them.
[1:20:37.680 --> 1:20:40.680]  They said they're not being forceful at all.
[1:20:40.680 --> 1:20:44.680]  Well, I just showed Kathleen Sebelius, the head of Health and Human Services
[1:20:44.680 --> 1:20:49.680]  under Obama saying you shouldn't be able to have a job or your children or children.
[1:20:49.680 --> 1:20:53.680]  God, you don't get money and you don't have your children.
[1:20:53.680 --> 1:20:56.680]  Well, that sounds pretty damn bad.
[1:20:56.680 --> 1:20:59.680]  Most folks commit suicide in that, but that's not forceful.
[1:20:59.680 --> 1:21:02.680]  I mean, you heard them. Oh, this isn't forceful at all.
[1:21:02.680 --> 1:21:07.680]  No, it's not forceful when they gave that little black kid in a photo.
[1:21:07.680 --> 1:21:10.680]  Where was that Tanzania?
[1:21:10.680 --> 1:21:13.680]  They gave him a live polio.
[1:21:13.680 --> 1:21:16.680]  How about you paralyze till your ass dies? That's pretty little.
[1:21:16.680 --> 1:21:18.680]  Look, though, it's a black lady doing it.
[1:21:18.680 --> 1:21:21.680]  That's all right. Hey, look, a black lady came from Bill Gates.
[1:21:21.680 --> 1:21:25.680]  Hey, pull it up. Most polio caused by Bill Gates funded polio program.
[1:21:25.680 --> 1:21:27.680]  Reuters. That's the headline.
[1:21:27.680 --> 1:21:29.680]  Most polio cases, AP2.
[1:21:29.680 --> 1:21:32.680]  Most polio cases caused by Bill Gates.
[1:21:32.680 --> 1:21:34.680]  Wow.
[1:21:34.680 --> 1:21:39.680]  Oh, but I'm sorry. There's nothing forceful going on anywhere, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:21:39.680 --> 1:21:41.680]  There's nothing going on. Look at this right here.
[1:21:41.680 --> 1:21:44.680]  I mean, to play the video for you.
[1:21:44.680 --> 1:21:49.680]  Macron announces those without COVID vaccine passes will be banned from routine life activities.
[1:21:49.680 --> 1:21:52.680]  Close quote. I mean, there's nothing forceful here.
[1:21:52.680 --> 1:21:56.680]  Oh, thank God we're not making these people do anything.
[1:21:56.680 --> 1:21:58.680]  I mean, you know.
[1:21:58.680 --> 1:22:05.680]  Yeah, that's a good headline for the Guardian.
[1:22:05.680 --> 1:22:08.680]  You guys pulled one up last week. I hadn't even seen from like AP.
[1:22:08.680 --> 1:22:10.680]  I had Reuters. I was telling Joe Rogan.
[1:22:10.680 --> 1:22:13.680]  I was on the show back in October of last year.
[1:22:13.680 --> 1:22:16.680]  I want to get back on soon. And I'm sitting there and I'm like, yeah,
[1:22:16.680 --> 1:22:20.680]  you know, the majority of polio they look the last decade was caused by Bill Gates vaccine.
[1:22:20.680 --> 1:22:22.680]  And they're, oh, really? Let's fact check that.
[1:22:22.680 --> 1:22:24.680]  And Joe knows I don't make stuff up.
[1:22:24.680 --> 1:22:31.680]  Search engine it and it was it was Reuters Gates back vaccine causes majority of polio.
[1:22:31.680 --> 1:22:35.680]  Or polio you and back polio vaccine causing majority of polio.
[1:22:35.680 --> 1:22:37.680]  But they even found an AP headline last week.
[1:22:37.680 --> 1:22:46.680]  There it is. You and says new polio breaking Sudan caused by oral vaccine. Oh.
[1:22:46.680 --> 1:22:48.680]  Oh, but I'm the white supremacist.
[1:22:48.680 --> 1:22:54.680]  All those big black podcasters funded by YouTube and Google and Apple,
[1:22:54.680 --> 1:22:58.680]  why they all sit up there every day with a talking point that I'm a white supremacist.
[1:22:58.680 --> 1:23:01.680]  Yeah, I'm a real white supremacist. Oh my God.
[1:23:01.680 --> 1:23:04.680]  That's why I don't want to kill him black people.
[1:23:04.680 --> 1:23:07.680]  Because you know, it's God's job. Who's going to get killed?
[1:23:07.680 --> 1:23:09.680]  Okay, maybe Africa gets a giant population.
[1:23:09.680 --> 1:23:12.680]  The UN opens them up and brings them in here and they kill me. It's okay.
[1:23:12.680 --> 1:23:15.680]  I'm not killing little black kids. I'm not killing little white kids.
[1:23:15.680 --> 1:23:19.680]  I'm not deciding that I'm going to kill a bunch of people because they might do something bad to me.
[1:23:19.680 --> 1:23:22.680]  See, it's not because I'm a goody tissues, folks.
[1:23:22.680 --> 1:23:26.680]  When I even think about Bill Gates, they're making the decision to do this.
[1:23:26.680 --> 1:23:29.680]  Well, they wrapped themselves. Oh, we're black lives matter.
[1:23:29.680 --> 1:23:32.680]  Bill Gates gave 50 million to him.
[1:23:32.680 --> 1:23:38.680]  And these are statements like we need to call Africans.
[1:23:38.680 --> 1:23:48.680]  And all these pimp black men that sit up there, they're the ones getting pimped by the system.
[1:23:48.680 --> 1:23:53.680]  They think they're the pimp. They sit up there like button and all them and call me a racist.
[1:23:53.680 --> 1:23:59.680]  Yeah, sure, man. You're going to have to face God button and every other damn person.
[1:23:59.680 --> 1:24:03.680]  I don't care what color you are when you sit there and you push this crap.
[1:24:03.680 --> 1:24:08.680]  Oh, you heard him. Oh, nobody's pressuring you.
[1:24:08.680 --> 1:24:13.680]  We just heard the Health and Human Secretary had say you shouldn't even have a job or children.
[1:24:13.680 --> 1:24:14.680]  Here's another one.
[1:24:14.680 --> 1:24:20.680]  Sebelius unvaccinated Americans should not be allowed to work or have children.
[1:24:20.680 --> 1:24:27.680]  Obama official, you should lose your job if you don't take experimental gene therapy vaccine.
[1:24:27.680 --> 1:24:35.680]  CBS anchor brags to Fauci, she's banning unvaccinated family members from Thanksgiving.
[1:24:35.680 --> 1:24:39.680]  Well, I don't want to go to your damn Thanksgiving, you demon woman.
[1:24:39.680 --> 1:24:43.680]  WHO epidemiologist says it was disgusting.
[1:24:43.680 --> 1:24:49.680]  It was devastating to see fans enjoying euros finally unmasked.
[1:24:49.680 --> 1:24:54.680]  Look at all those weird ass humans sharing all their bugs, getting healthier.
[1:24:54.680 --> 1:24:58.680]  Every study actually shows when you get a couple hundred thousand people together,
[1:24:58.680 --> 1:25:01.680]  they all share each other's DNA.
[1:25:01.680 --> 1:25:04.680]  We all commune. That's why we like to go.
[1:25:04.680 --> 1:25:07.680]  It's not about the game. It's what we all get together.
[1:25:07.680 --> 1:25:09.680]  And they don't like that. Do they?
[1:25:09.680 --> 1:25:14.680]  And they got all these damn rappers about, yeah, back that ass up.
[1:25:14.680 --> 1:25:17.680]  And now the new song is back that Vax up.
[1:25:17.680 --> 1:25:19.680]  He's like, baby, I'll have sex with you.
[1:25:19.680 --> 1:25:21.680]  But he's not throwing money out anymore. $100 bills.
[1:25:21.680 --> 1:25:24.680]  He's throwing a batch card. Here, baby, I'll give you a blood clot.
[1:25:24.680 --> 1:25:26.680]  I'll give you brain cancer. I'll give you a heart attack.
[1:25:26.680 --> 1:25:28.680]  I'll give you a stillborn baby.
[1:25:28.680 --> 1:25:31.680]  I'm black, though. Trust me. Take the shot.
[1:25:31.680 --> 1:25:33.680]  You can sterilize black, lady. I'm button.
[1:25:33.680 --> 1:25:36.680]  I'm the liberal black guy. Take your death.
[1:25:36.680 --> 1:25:39.680]  Gonna give me that money.
[1:25:39.680 --> 1:25:42.680]  Gonna fight that race as hell it shows.
[1:25:42.680 --> 1:25:45.680]  Oh, look, we took down a Robert E. Lee statue.
[1:25:45.680 --> 1:25:49.680]  Take a shot. Take a shot. Take a shot.
[1:25:49.680 --> 1:25:52.680]  Burn in hell, New World Order.
[1:25:52.680 --> 1:25:56.680]  So many people say to me, Alex, please stop being so negative.
[1:25:56.680 --> 1:25:59.680]  Well, for me, admitting I've gotten a rotten tooth
[1:25:59.680 --> 1:26:02.680]  and going in a root canal is not negative.
[1:26:02.680 --> 1:26:05.680]  It hurts. It stinks. It's got pus coming out of it.
[1:26:05.680 --> 1:26:08.680]  I go to the doctor. They fix it. That's not negative.
[1:26:08.680 --> 1:26:10.680]  I'm not living into none.
[1:26:10.680 --> 1:26:14.680]  And so think of globalism as being hidden as an infection that we feel yet,
[1:26:14.680 --> 1:26:18.680]  but now it's come to the surface. That's actually a positive thing.
[1:26:18.680 --> 1:26:20.680]  And so, yeah, Trump did an overall great job.
[1:26:20.680 --> 1:26:23.680]  They stole the election. We can't get down about that.
[1:26:23.680 --> 1:26:27.680]  We have forced them out in the open.
[1:26:27.680 --> 1:26:29.680]  So now they're trying to suppress us
[1:26:29.680 --> 1:26:31.680]  because they know they've been exposed. They're scared.
[1:26:31.680 --> 1:26:34.680]  That's why, instead of saying, oh, we're a bunch of losers.
[1:26:34.680 --> 1:26:36.680]  Look what happened. No, we're a bunch of winners.
[1:26:36.680 --> 1:26:39.680]  They're trying to suppress us. Let our light of truth shine
[1:26:39.680 --> 1:26:41.680]  and tell everybody what's happening.
[1:26:41.680 --> 1:26:45.680]  Your own website, your own show, my show, other articles, other videos.
[1:26:45.680 --> 1:26:49.680]  Just keep sharing however you can and realize we're in an information war.
[1:26:49.680 --> 1:26:53.680]  We're going to win this together and the fight starts at infowars.com.
[1:26:53.680 --> 1:26:56.680]  Gerald in South Carolina. Go ahead. You're on the air.
[1:26:56.680 --> 1:26:57.680]  Trying to move quicker.
[1:26:57.680 --> 1:26:58.680]  Hey, Alex. Welcome.
[1:26:58.680 --> 1:27:01.680]  Would like to say first off, thanks for being the voice of reason
[1:27:01.680 --> 1:27:03.680]  and amongst all this stupidity.
[1:27:03.680 --> 1:27:06.680]  Wanted to warn people I've been trying to get a hold of you for a year, okay?
[1:27:06.680 --> 1:27:11.680]  I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung
[1:27:11.680 --> 1:27:13.680]  that'll never go away.
[1:27:13.680 --> 1:27:15.680]  Living defense saved my life.
[1:27:15.680 --> 1:27:19.680]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[1:27:19.680 --> 1:27:21.680]  Living defense brought me back.
[1:27:21.680 --> 1:27:26.680]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible, Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[1:27:26.680 --> 1:27:45.680]  This is Matthew 24, verse 9.
[1:27:45.680 --> 1:27:48.680]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country
[1:27:48.680 --> 1:27:51.680]  no matter what they say and that's why the enemy hates it
[1:27:51.680 --> 1:27:54.680]  because God created this country.
[1:27:54.680 --> 1:28:09.680]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[1:28:09.680 --> 1:28:20.680]  Infowars has been banned, arrested, attacked and threatened
[1:28:20.680 --> 1:28:24.680]  because we are effective.
[1:28:24.680 --> 1:28:26.680]  The great awakening is here.
[1:28:26.680 --> 1:28:32.680]  Go to banned.video, download the videos and share.
[1:28:32.680 --> 1:28:39.680]  Support the information war at infowarstore.com
[1:28:39.680 --> 1:28:49.680]  and never give up the fight.
[1:28:49.680 --> 1:28:57.680]  Go to banned.video, download the videos and share.
[1:28:57.680 --> 1:28:59.680]  Jacob in Ohio, welcome, go ahead.
[1:28:59.680 --> 1:29:01.680]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[1:29:01.680 --> 1:29:02.680]  Great last caller.
[1:29:02.680 --> 1:29:05.680]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[1:29:05.680 --> 1:29:08.680]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore
[1:29:08.680 --> 1:29:11.680]  with all the gaslighting, moralization and absurdity.
[1:29:11.680 --> 1:29:13.680]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone.
[1:29:13.680 --> 1:29:15.680]  Alright, Eric's in New Hampshire.
[1:29:15.680 --> 1:29:16.680]  Eric, thanks for calling, go ahead.
[1:29:16.680 --> 1:29:19.680]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[1:29:19.680 --> 1:29:21.680]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out
[1:29:21.680 --> 1:29:22.680]  for the point of the product.
[1:29:22.680 --> 1:29:23.680]  The X2 does wonders.
[1:29:23.680 --> 1:29:25.680]  They recommend it to everybody here on the fence about it.
[1:29:25.680 --> 1:29:28.680]  Get off the fence, get the product, support the info war.
[1:29:28.680 --> 1:29:30.680]  Tyler in Maine, you're on the air.
[1:29:30.680 --> 1:29:31.680]  Thanks for holding, go ahead.
[1:29:31.680 --> 1:29:33.680]  Hey, Alex, it's great to be on with you.
[1:29:33.680 --> 1:29:34.680]  It's an honor.
[1:29:34.680 --> 1:29:35.680]  Honored to talk to you.
[1:29:35.680 --> 1:29:36.680]  Awesome.
[1:29:36.680 --> 1:29:39.680]  So, firstly, I wanted to do is say I love the products.
[1:29:39.680 --> 1:29:42.680]  Alpha Power, even at 29, if you ask my better half,
[1:29:42.680 --> 1:29:45.680]  she loves it and it helps in the bedroom.
[1:29:45.680 --> 1:29:48.680]  Well, it definitely works, it's not a joke.
[1:29:48.680 --> 1:29:49.680]  Absolutely.
[1:29:49.680 --> 1:30:12.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:30:12.680 --> 1:30:32.680]  The people are fighting in Africa.
[1:30:32.680 --> 1:30:34.680]  They're fighting in Europe.
[1:30:34.680 --> 1:30:36.680]  They're fighting in America.
[1:30:36.680 --> 1:30:37.680]  They're fighting in Asia.
[1:30:37.680 --> 1:30:42.680]  They're fighting in the entire planet against the globalist takeover.
[1:30:42.680 --> 1:30:48.680]  They want freedom and they want it now.
[1:30:48.680 --> 1:30:50.680]  Look at the video of your TV viewer.
[1:30:50.680 --> 1:30:56.680]  You can see massive demonstrations in France against forced inoculation,
[1:30:56.680 --> 1:30:59.680]  announced, taking action.
[1:30:59.680 --> 1:31:02.680]  The people are going to storm the Bastille.
[1:31:02.680 --> 1:31:06.680]  The tyrants are going to push and push and push until the bankers
[1:31:06.680 --> 1:31:08.680]  and the globalists are brought to justice.
[1:31:08.680 --> 1:31:14.680]  But I have war games, ladies and gentlemen, every angle of this.
[1:31:14.680 --> 1:31:19.680]  And they launched this bio attack and this lockdown and all the tyranny
[1:31:19.680 --> 1:31:23.680]  that came out of it because they were already losing.
[1:31:23.680 --> 1:31:27.680]  And I want to warn you, they've got stuff far worse on the shelf.
[1:31:27.680 --> 1:31:31.680]  The evidence looks like they're already releasing to try to suppress us
[1:31:31.680 --> 1:31:34.680]  and control us.
[1:31:34.680 --> 1:31:37.680]  Now, I know it's entertaining when I blow up and all that,
[1:31:37.680 --> 1:31:38.680]  but that's not an act.
[1:31:38.680 --> 1:31:40.680]  That's not fake, folks.
[1:31:40.680 --> 1:31:45.680]  And I think it's a manifestation, though, of all of us.
[1:31:45.680 --> 1:31:47.680]  We're pissed.
[1:31:47.680 --> 1:31:53.680]  And I am pissed at the black leaders particularly because it's true.
[1:31:53.680 --> 1:31:57.680]  They're particularly targeting black people with their extermination operation.
[1:31:57.680 --> 1:32:01.680]  That's why they bought off the black leaders to try to make their whole movement
[1:32:01.680 --> 1:32:03.680]  say it supports black people.
[1:32:03.680 --> 1:32:05.680]  It's a disgusting fraud.
[1:32:05.680 --> 1:32:07.680]  And I'm not going to kiss black people's ass.
[1:32:07.680 --> 1:32:09.680]  I haven't done anything to you.
[1:32:09.680 --> 1:32:10.680]  I'm a champion for human liberty.
[1:32:10.680 --> 1:32:13.680]  All I care about is you got red blood and you're a human.
[1:32:13.680 --> 1:32:17.680]  And so it's time to dispense with the white liberals that go,
[1:32:17.680 --> 1:32:20.680]  oh, you're a racist if you don't do like I say.
[1:32:20.680 --> 1:32:23.680]  Because I'm pissed off at the black people.
[1:32:23.680 --> 1:32:27.680]  I outrageously hate white liberals.
[1:32:27.680 --> 1:32:30.680]  I mean, they're at a whole other level than black liberals.
[1:32:30.680 --> 1:32:34.680]  You talk about somebody I really don't like, it's these white people.
[1:32:34.680 --> 1:32:38.680]  So I think we can really organize around the fact that the white liberal
[1:32:38.680 --> 1:32:42.680]  thinks they control all of us and are playing us off against each other.
[1:32:42.680 --> 1:32:43.680]  And they're fake.
[1:32:43.680 --> 1:32:44.680]  And they're evil.
[1:32:44.680 --> 1:32:47.680]  And they got to be dealt with.
[1:32:47.680 --> 1:32:52.680]  Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates and Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger.
[1:32:52.680 --> 1:32:58.680]  You want to put me in a forced labor camp, Charlie Munger?
[1:32:58.680 --> 1:33:03.680]  You think I exist for your old evil ass to fill power now?
[1:33:03.680 --> 1:33:08.680]  My ancestor didn't do what they did so you could piss on me.
[1:33:08.680 --> 1:33:13.680]  You piece of filth.
[1:33:13.680 --> 1:33:14.680]  Doesn't matter.
[1:33:14.680 --> 1:33:16.680]  God's going to destroy them.
[1:33:16.680 --> 1:33:17.680]  And that's what all of us think.
[1:33:17.680 --> 1:33:18.680]  The enemy's winning.
[1:33:18.680 --> 1:33:19.680]  You're wrong.
[1:33:19.680 --> 1:33:20.680]  The enemy's losing.
[1:33:20.680 --> 1:33:22.680]  This is all desperate behavior by the global.
[1:33:22.680 --> 1:33:25.680]  So let me stop.
[1:33:25.680 --> 1:33:31.680]  You know, I literally have like 50 incredible articles in video and I'm so mad after watching
[1:33:31.680 --> 1:33:32.680]  them.
[1:33:32.680 --> 1:33:36.680]  I can't even cover it.
[1:33:36.680 --> 1:33:41.680]  Let's do this.
[1:33:41.680 --> 1:33:50.680]  I got Dixon, William, Barbara, Rob, Luke, first timer, Louisiana, Gail, John, Jerry,
[1:33:50.680 --> 1:33:52.680]  Boomer, Cody and others.
[1:33:52.680 --> 1:33:56.680]  And we've got Darren McBrane's new powerful compilation.
[1:33:56.680 --> 1:33:57.680]  Everybody should see to save lives.
[1:33:57.680 --> 1:33:58.680]  This is life and death.
[1:33:58.680 --> 1:34:00.680]  I won't just say this is life and death.
[1:34:00.680 --> 1:34:01.680]  This is life and death.
[1:34:01.680 --> 1:34:02.680]  This is life and death.
[1:34:02.680 --> 1:34:06.680]  Deadly COVID-vax side effects are not rare.
[1:34:06.680 --> 1:34:07.680]  And you know, McBrane's a great guy.
[1:34:07.680 --> 1:34:09.680]  He's a great editor, a great researcher.
[1:34:09.680 --> 1:34:14.680]  But let's just change this headline and make it more accurate.
[1:34:14.680 --> 1:34:18.680]  The COVID vaccine is designed to kill you.
[1:34:18.680 --> 1:34:19.680]  Death is its main effect.
[1:34:19.680 --> 1:34:21.680]  Or how do you say that?
[1:34:21.680 --> 1:34:24.680]  The COVID vaccine is not a vaccine.
[1:34:24.680 --> 1:34:27.680]  It's a kill shot.
[1:34:27.680 --> 1:34:29.680]  The COVID vaccine is designed to kill you.
[1:34:29.680 --> 1:34:31.680]  Death is not a side effect.
[1:34:31.680 --> 1:34:32.680]  How do you say that?
[1:34:32.680 --> 1:34:38.680]  Because it's not a side effect.
[1:34:38.680 --> 1:34:40.680]  Powerful video.
[1:34:40.680 --> 1:34:42.680]  Needs to get seen 10 billion times.
[1:34:42.680 --> 1:34:44.680]  Needs to save the world.
[1:34:44.680 --> 1:34:48.680]  Only way dog hunts, you let it out.
[1:34:48.680 --> 1:34:52.680]  Four minutes.
[1:34:52.680 --> 1:34:54.680]  Because he has to be able to have it work and air as a,
[1:34:54.680 --> 1:34:56.680]  we don't really run a lot of ads here on TV.
[1:34:56.680 --> 1:34:58.680]  It's just information.
[1:34:58.680 --> 1:34:59.680]  And that's before minutes.
[1:34:59.680 --> 1:35:01.680]  He could be 20 minutes long of just quick clips.
[1:35:01.680 --> 1:35:02.680]  This person died.
[1:35:02.680 --> 1:35:03.680]  That person died.
[1:35:03.680 --> 1:35:04.680]  They died.
[1:35:04.680 --> 1:35:05.680]  She died.
[1:35:05.680 --> 1:35:06.680]  Hell, let's do this.
[1:35:06.680 --> 1:35:07.680]  Let's air it.
[1:35:07.680 --> 1:35:10.680]  And then start your engines.
[1:35:10.680 --> 1:35:12.680]  When I come back out of that break,
[1:35:12.680 --> 1:35:16.680]  I'm going right to your phone calls here.
[1:35:16.680 --> 1:35:18.680]  But I mean, I mean, seriously,
[1:35:18.680 --> 1:35:20.680]  I take it personal when they're raping us
[1:35:20.680 --> 1:35:22.680]  and murdering us like this.
[1:35:22.680 --> 1:35:24.680]  And we've just got to get out of our shells
[1:35:24.680 --> 1:35:26.680]  and realize this is going on and admit it.
[1:35:26.680 --> 1:35:28.680]  And just, it's like you're in a fight.
[1:35:28.680 --> 1:35:29.680]  I'm sure a lot of you have.
[1:35:29.680 --> 1:35:30.680]  You're kind of a little scared.
[1:35:30.680 --> 1:35:31.680]  Guys pretty big at first.
[1:35:31.680 --> 1:35:32.680]  All of a sudden the fight starts.
[1:35:32.680 --> 1:35:33.680]  You ain't worried now.
[1:35:33.680 --> 1:35:35.680]  You're beating the living hell out of them.
[1:35:35.680 --> 1:35:36.680]  And they tack you back.
[1:35:36.680 --> 1:35:37.680]  It doesn't matter.
[1:35:37.680 --> 1:35:38.680]  You're in the fight now.
[1:35:38.680 --> 1:35:41.680]  Well, let me give you a little news flash, boys and girls.
[1:35:41.680 --> 1:35:43.680]  You're in the fight now, baby.
[1:35:43.680 --> 1:35:45.680]  They're coming for you.
[1:35:45.680 --> 1:35:48.680]  There ain't no more games now.
[1:35:48.680 --> 1:35:50.680]  You're going to let them keep killing us
[1:35:50.680 --> 1:35:52.680]  or you're going to spread the word.
[1:35:52.680 --> 1:35:53.680]  Here it is.
[1:35:53.680 --> 1:35:57.680]  A word of warning to you, my fellow Americans.
[1:35:57.680 --> 1:36:00.680]  The second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine is no joke.
[1:36:00.680 --> 1:36:03.680]  I had the COVID booster in Moderna
[1:36:03.680 --> 1:36:05.680]  about four or five days ago.
[1:36:05.680 --> 1:36:09.680]  And I am still feeling wild side effects from it.
[1:36:09.680 --> 1:36:12.680]  It made me feel worse than I felt in a long time.
[1:36:12.680 --> 1:36:15.680]  The worst flu in the world, extreme shortness of breath.
[1:36:15.680 --> 1:36:17.680]  I just felt so bad.
[1:36:17.680 --> 1:36:19.680]  A dizziness, fatigue.
[1:36:19.680 --> 1:36:20.680]  Shaking chills.
[1:36:20.680 --> 1:36:21.680]  Fever.
[1:36:21.680 --> 1:36:23.680]  Extremely irrational thinking.
[1:36:23.680 --> 1:36:24.680]  Akes.
[1:36:24.680 --> 1:36:25.680]  Headaches.
[1:36:25.680 --> 1:36:27.680]  And it has just been devastating.
[1:36:27.680 --> 1:36:28.680]  Just felt miserable.
[1:36:28.680 --> 1:36:30.680]  I was out for the count for about a week.
[1:36:30.680 --> 1:36:33.680]  Agony and chronic pain.
[1:36:33.680 --> 1:36:37.680]  I lost the use of my hands for about three weeks.
[1:36:37.680 --> 1:36:42.680]  The vaccine took my immune system and just shook it around again.
[1:36:42.680 --> 1:36:43.680]  And that's still going on.
[1:36:43.680 --> 1:36:46.680]  And in Orange County, an x-ray technician has died
[1:36:46.680 --> 1:36:49.680]  after getting his second dose of the Pfizer vaccine.
[1:36:49.680 --> 1:36:52.680]  Cassidy got the second Moderna shot on a Monday.
[1:36:52.680 --> 1:36:54.680]  By Thursday morning, they were in the ER.
[1:36:54.680 --> 1:36:57.680]  She got sick right away.
[1:36:57.680 --> 1:37:01.680]  The death of his youngest daughter, Cassidy, came out of nowhere
[1:37:01.680 --> 1:37:04.680]  four days after her second dose of the COVID vaccine.
[1:37:04.680 --> 1:37:08.680]  Everybody from her work had kind of had flu-like symptoms.
[1:37:08.680 --> 1:37:10.680]  Just like the nurse was telling us earlier today.
[1:37:10.680 --> 1:37:12.680]  When we got tested, she experienced chills.
[1:37:12.680 --> 1:37:14.680]  And she said all her friends did too.
[1:37:14.680 --> 1:37:15.680]  Yep, all her friends did.
[1:37:15.680 --> 1:37:17.680]  There's a report from the New York Times
[1:37:17.680 --> 1:37:19.680]  that there's been a severe allergic reaction
[1:37:19.680 --> 1:37:21.680]  from a health care worker in Alaska
[1:37:21.680 --> 1:37:24.680]  after receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.
[1:37:24.680 --> 1:37:27.680]  Patriot doctor in Missouri works at nursing home
[1:37:27.680 --> 1:37:29.680]  and wants to comment on COVID vaccines.
[1:37:29.680 --> 1:37:30.680]  Hi, Alex.
[1:37:30.680 --> 1:37:34.680]  So I'm a family medicine trainer.
[1:37:34.680 --> 1:37:35.680]  I'm a jury nutritioner.
[1:37:35.680 --> 1:37:36.680]  I work in nursing homes.
[1:37:36.680 --> 1:37:41.680]  I have had 21 patients that I've identified
[1:37:41.680 --> 1:37:43.680]  that have died within 48 hours
[1:37:43.680 --> 1:37:47.680]  of getting either the first or second vaccine from AstraZeneca.
[1:37:47.680 --> 1:37:54.680]  She was healthy, happy, active.
[1:37:54.680 --> 1:37:57.680]  The greatest mom you ever saw in your life.
[1:37:57.680 --> 1:38:01.680]  And then she was so sick that she was, you know,
[1:38:01.680 --> 1:38:03.680]  in less than probably 12 hours,
[1:38:03.680 --> 1:38:06.680]  she was intubated and on life support.
[1:38:06.680 --> 1:38:08.680]  And then she passed.
[1:38:08.680 --> 1:38:12.680]  When you get this spike protein antibody in your system,
[1:38:12.680 --> 1:38:14.680]  it will permanently and irreversibly
[1:38:14.680 --> 1:38:16.680]  change your immune system.
[1:38:16.680 --> 1:38:18.680]  When you inject this shot
[1:38:18.680 --> 1:38:21.680]  that has this polyethylene glycol on the coating
[1:38:21.680 --> 1:38:23.680]  on the outside of it,
[1:38:23.680 --> 1:38:26.680]  that is what is leading to anaphylactic reactions,
[1:38:26.680 --> 1:38:28.680]  shock and death.
[1:38:28.680 --> 1:38:30.680]  I think we're going to see massive injuries
[1:38:30.680 --> 1:38:33.680]  and a lot more deaths start somewhere
[1:38:33.680 --> 1:38:35.680]  between four and 18 months from now.
[1:38:35.680 --> 1:38:37.680]  I'm receiving the second shot.
[1:38:37.680 --> 1:38:40.680]  Maddie immediately felt pain at the adduction site.
[1:38:40.680 --> 1:38:42.680]  And over the next 24 hours,
[1:38:42.680 --> 1:38:45.680]  she developed severe abdominal and chest pain
[1:38:45.680 --> 1:38:48.680]  and the way she described the chest pain,
[1:38:48.680 --> 1:38:49.680]  and I quote,
[1:38:49.680 --> 1:38:52.680]  it feels like my heart is being ripped out through my neck.
[1:38:52.680 --> 1:38:54.680]  She had pain for electrical shocks,
[1:38:54.680 --> 1:38:57.680]  her neck and spine that forced her to walk face over.
[1:38:57.680 --> 1:39:00.680]  The 35-year-old wife and mother of four died, quote,
[1:39:00.680 --> 1:39:02.680]  as the result of complications
[1:39:02.680 --> 1:39:06.680]  after receiving the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine.
[1:39:06.680 --> 1:39:10.680]  Mom 45, who got job at John Hopkins Hospital,
[1:39:10.680 --> 1:39:13.680]  dies after reaction to work mandated COVID-19.
[1:39:13.680 --> 1:39:14.680]  You ought to read about her.
[1:39:14.680 --> 1:39:15.680]  You ought to read her Facebook.
[1:39:15.680 --> 1:39:16.680]  But you better read it quick.
[1:39:16.680 --> 1:39:18.680]  Most people that die, they take their Facebooks down.
[1:39:18.680 --> 1:39:21.680]  A handful of deaths, including griselbas,
[1:39:21.680 --> 1:39:24.680]  under investigation because they happened one to three days
[1:39:24.680 --> 1:39:27.680]  after the person got a COVID-19 vaccine dose.
[1:39:27.680 --> 1:39:29.680]  His dad died four days after getting
[1:39:29.680 --> 1:39:31.680]  the second shot of Pfizer vaccine.
[1:39:31.680 --> 1:39:33.680]  20-year-old, who's loved the vaccines,
[1:39:33.680 --> 1:39:36.680]  promoted the vaccine, said how great they were,
[1:39:36.680 --> 1:39:38.680]  went to get her vaccine, died.
[1:39:38.680 --> 1:39:42.680]  Weeks after getting her mandated Russian roulette shock,
[1:39:42.680 --> 1:39:43.680]  it died.
[1:39:43.680 --> 1:39:45.680]  Killed her.
[1:39:45.680 --> 1:39:48.680]  The first guy to take it died after he took it.
[1:39:48.680 --> 1:39:52.680]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[1:39:52.680 --> 1:39:56.680]  X2 has been our number one bestseller over the years.
[1:39:56.680 --> 1:39:59.680]  Deep Earth Crystal iodine, the good halogen,
[1:39:59.680 --> 1:40:02.680]  it is essential for all actions in the body.
[1:40:02.680 --> 1:40:03.680]  You must have it to live.
[1:40:03.680 --> 1:40:05.680]  The UN estimates 2 billion plus people
[1:40:05.680 --> 1:40:07.680]  have cognitive disabilities because they don't have enough iodine.
[1:40:07.680 --> 1:40:09.680]  We have X2 in two different bottles,
[1:40:09.680 --> 1:40:11.680]  the same amount in each bottle,
[1:40:11.680 --> 1:40:13.680]  but one has a spray top, one has a dropper top.
[1:40:13.680 --> 1:40:15.680]  60% off on the spray top,
[1:40:15.680 --> 1:40:18.680]  40% off on the dropper top for a limited time
[1:40:18.680 --> 1:40:20.680]  because they're both selling out.
[1:40:20.680 --> 1:40:22.680]  I want to thank all of the supporters
[1:40:22.680 --> 1:40:23.680]  that have gotten these over the years.
[1:40:23.680 --> 1:40:24.680]  They're amazing.
[1:40:24.680 --> 1:40:26.680]  So that's a great deal for you to stock up on it.
[1:40:26.680 --> 1:40:29.680]  But this deal is really for folks that have been on the fence
[1:40:29.680 --> 1:40:31.680]  and haven't experienced the good halogen for yourself.
[1:40:31.680 --> 1:40:34.680]  So, X2 in the dropper bottle and the spray bottle,
[1:40:34.680 --> 1:40:36.680]  60 and 40% off for a limited time
[1:40:36.680 --> 1:40:39.680]  because it's selling out right now at InfoWarshot.com.
[1:40:39.680 --> 1:40:41.680]  But we're going to keep this cell going until it sells out.
[1:40:41.680 --> 1:40:43.680]  It'll probably take about two weeks.
[1:40:43.680 --> 1:40:45.680]  So don't procrastinate.
[1:40:45.680 --> 1:40:47.680]  Take advantage of this special right now at InfoWarshot.com
[1:40:47.680 --> 1:40:49.680]  and check out the new products we just got in as well.
[1:40:57.680 --> 1:40:59.680]  Granny Do Right.
[1:40:59.680 --> 1:41:01.680]  Thanks for holding her on the air. Go ahead.
[1:41:01.680 --> 1:41:04.680]  First of all, let me say I love your products.
[1:41:04.680 --> 1:41:08.680]  I am a granny and for all the senior citizens out there
[1:41:08.680 --> 1:41:11.680]  that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me,
[1:41:11.680 --> 1:41:15.680]  I love the sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called.
[1:41:15.680 --> 1:41:18.680]  But since taking your X2 for the last couple of years,
[1:41:18.680 --> 1:41:21.680]  my skin is just really gorgeous, actually.
[1:41:21.680 --> 1:41:23.680]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[1:41:23.680 --> 1:41:26.680]  And I was already taking your other supplements,
[1:41:26.680 --> 1:41:29.680]  but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do
[1:41:29.680 --> 1:41:32.680]  because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[1:41:32.680 --> 1:41:35.680]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately.
[1:41:35.680 --> 1:41:37.680]  But, you know, over a period of time,
[1:41:37.680 --> 1:41:40.680]  I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket.
[1:41:40.680 --> 1:41:42.680]  This is working. This is wonderful.
[1:41:42.680 --> 1:41:46.680]  You know, I don't have to put on derma blend anymore.
[1:41:46.680 --> 1:41:49.680]  You know, so anyway, it worked wonderfully
[1:41:49.680 --> 1:41:52.680]  and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[1:41:54.680 --> 1:41:57.680]  I preach about the dangers of cell phones all day long
[1:41:57.680 --> 1:42:00.680]  because they're supercomputers controlled by Big Tech
[1:42:00.680 --> 1:42:02.680]  that are spying on us everywhere we go when we do.
[1:42:02.680 --> 1:42:05.680]  But because they have great cameras and great recording systems
[1:42:05.680 --> 1:42:08.680]  and great ways to communicate, I still have one
[1:42:08.680 --> 1:42:11.680]  because this Trojan horse, this Pyramidian fire, has a lot of power.
[1:42:11.680 --> 1:42:15.680]  But when I'm not using it, I lock it up in a high quality Faraday cage,
[1:42:15.680 --> 1:42:18.680]  a privacy pocket at infowarstore.com.
[1:42:18.680 --> 1:42:21.680]  We finally got them back in stock, the highest rated.
[1:42:21.680 --> 1:42:27.680]  They fit almost all types of androids and iPhones at 50% off, $14.95.
[1:42:27.680 --> 1:42:30.680]  They sell these babies for $29.95 all day long.
[1:42:30.680 --> 1:42:35.680]  We've got a private label with info wars on them for $14.95
[1:42:35.680 --> 1:42:38.680]  because I want you to get them and I want you to buy friends
[1:42:38.680 --> 1:42:41.680]  and family of these systems to educate them about
[1:42:41.680 --> 1:42:43.680]  what these, quote, smartphones really are.
[1:42:43.680 --> 1:42:46.680]  This is a great way to limit your phone time use.
[1:42:46.680 --> 1:42:48.680]  It's a great way to spend more time with your family
[1:42:48.680 --> 1:42:50.680]  and it's a great way to know you're not being tracked
[1:42:50.680 --> 1:42:51.680]  by the criminal globalist system.
[1:42:51.680 --> 1:42:54.680]  They're 50% off right now at infowarstore.com.
[1:42:54.680 --> 1:42:57.680]  Iodine is one of the most important drivers of the body
[1:42:57.680 --> 1:43:01.680]  for fertility, for cellular function, for libido, for life.
[1:43:01.680 --> 1:43:04.680]  If you don't have iodine, you die in a matter of months.
[1:43:04.680 --> 1:43:06.680]  So if you don't have oxygen, you die in four minutes.
[1:43:06.680 --> 1:43:08.680]  If you don't have water, you die in a week or so.
[1:43:08.680 --> 1:43:10.680]  If you don't have food, a month or so.
[1:43:10.680 --> 1:43:12.680]  But what's in that food? Iodine.
[1:43:12.680 --> 1:43:15.680]  But if your food doesn't have that atomic pure iodine,
[1:43:15.680 --> 1:43:18.680]  it can't operate and the food itself is lacking.
[1:43:18.680 --> 1:43:21.680]  That's why most people on earth are deficient in iodine
[1:43:21.680 --> 1:43:25.680]  and governments are lowering the allowances mostly you need to have
[1:43:25.680 --> 1:43:26.680]  because they want control.

[1:44:05.680 --> 1:44:23.680]  You're listening to an infowars.com frontline report.
[1:44:23.680 --> 1:44:24.680]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:44:24.680 --> 1:44:25.680]  Okay.
[1:44:25.680 --> 1:44:30.680]  So the globalists all operate on, we're going to evolve to submit to be slaves.
[1:44:30.680 --> 1:44:32.680]  They're going to hit us with tyranny and say,
[1:44:32.680 --> 1:44:35.680]  well, the answer is a world ID, personal passport,
[1:44:35.680 --> 1:44:36.680]  microchip out of the skin.
[1:44:36.680 --> 1:44:37.680]  And once you do that, you're free.
[1:44:37.680 --> 1:44:39.680]  Of course, you're not free once you do that.
[1:44:39.680 --> 1:44:42.680]  But they think we don't have long-term memory.
[1:44:42.680 --> 1:44:45.680]  Well, an animal doesn't remember,
[1:44:45.680 --> 1:44:47.680]  whether it's a prey animal, a bunny rabbit,
[1:44:47.680 --> 1:44:50.680]  or whether it's a tiger, it kind of operates in live time.
[1:44:50.680 --> 1:44:54.680]  But a human can sink long-term.
[1:44:54.680 --> 1:45:01.680]  And so does submitting to globalists make me healthier, freer, more successful?
[1:45:01.680 --> 1:45:05.680]  Or does it enslave me?
[1:45:05.680 --> 1:45:08.680]  And so it's that process we have to think about.
[1:45:08.680 --> 1:45:12.680]  And understand they're manipulating us with that same process.
[1:45:12.680 --> 1:45:15.680]  Okay, the French are burning stuff down and going crazy right now,
[1:45:15.680 --> 1:45:18.680]  and they're doing it in Cuba too to get a tyranny.
[1:45:18.680 --> 1:45:20.680]  But the globalists think it's going to go away.
[1:45:20.680 --> 1:45:23.680]  They think it's going to stop.
[1:45:23.680 --> 1:45:26.680]  What if they were like the real French resistance?
[1:45:26.680 --> 1:45:29.680]  What if they weren't just rioting on the street like the media shows you to?
[1:45:29.680 --> 1:45:35.680]  But what if leftist leaders, think tank members,
[1:45:35.680 --> 1:45:39.680]  board members of the Great Reset were at their home in Paris,
[1:45:39.680 --> 1:45:42.680]  and somebody dropped by to have tea with them?
[1:45:42.680 --> 1:45:46.680]  Then that would be a different response.
[1:45:46.680 --> 1:45:50.680]  We're supposed to go fight with the cops who are the same as us.
[1:45:50.680 --> 1:46:01.680]  No. Targeted activity.
[1:46:01.680 --> 1:46:05.680]  French citizens riot in response to plan to mandate vaccine passports,
[1:46:05.680 --> 1:46:13.680]  not vaccines, deadly, illegal, experimental, injection, violation, nuremberg code.
[1:46:13.680 --> 1:46:18.680]  Oh, blackout warfare, document warrants of devastating cyber attack by China.
[1:46:18.680 --> 1:46:23.680]  But the globalists will launch it and say it's China, but still do nothing.
[1:46:23.680 --> 1:46:28.680]  Because we're seen as wimps, because we're seen as dumb, they're going to do all this.
[1:46:28.680 --> 1:46:31.680]  The average American thinks if I comply, and I'm nice,
[1:46:31.680 --> 1:46:34.680]  and I go on with official statements, I'll get ahead.
[1:46:34.680 --> 1:46:37.680]  That's all over. That's in the past.
[1:46:37.680 --> 1:46:42.680]  Complying gets you dead now.
[1:46:42.680 --> 1:46:45.680]  All right, we got loaded phone lines.
[1:46:45.680 --> 1:46:47.680]  I'm going to go to Cody and then Dixon.
[1:46:47.680 --> 1:46:50.680]  Cody is in Missouri, the FEMA camps, it's announced.
[1:46:50.680 --> 1:46:53.680]  Now the next lockdown comes, which they're saying they're getting ready for,
[1:46:53.680 --> 1:46:55.680]  they're going to come grab you and disappear you,
[1:46:55.680 --> 1:46:58.680]  and then you're in a government medical center where they can,
[1:46:58.680 --> 1:47:01.680]  it's time for your intubation, Mr. Jones.
[1:47:01.680 --> 1:47:04.680]  Oh, Mr. Jones died of COVID.
[1:47:04.680 --> 1:47:08.680]  So they make it easy. Now they're going to the physical.
[1:47:08.680 --> 1:47:11.680]  And now the gloves come off. See how that works?
[1:47:11.680 --> 1:47:14.680]  But Cody, give us your take on that.
[1:47:14.680 --> 1:47:19.680]  I wanted to apologize because I stumbled across you 10 years ago,
[1:47:19.680 --> 1:47:22.680]  and I go, oh, Alex Jones is nuts.
[1:47:22.680 --> 1:47:25.680]  And I want to say sorry, I should have listened to you then,
[1:47:25.680 --> 1:47:27.680]  and maybe things would be different today.
[1:47:27.680 --> 1:47:30.680]  No need to apologize, brother. It's okay. I understand.
[1:47:30.680 --> 1:47:33.680]  I was reading globalist documents. They sound insane, don't they?
[1:47:33.680 --> 1:47:36.680]  Yes, they do. And I think that's one of the reasons
[1:47:36.680 --> 1:47:38.680]  why a lot of people don't believe it.
[1:47:38.680 --> 1:47:41.680]  But as far as these FEMA camps and trying to force people,
[1:47:41.680 --> 1:47:44.680]  I live in a rural community of a few thousand people.
[1:47:44.680 --> 1:47:48.680]  We never had a mask mandate at all in the state,
[1:47:48.680 --> 1:47:50.680]  where we were out within the state.
[1:47:50.680 --> 1:47:53.680]  They tried. People just wouldn't comply.
[1:47:53.680 --> 1:47:57.680]  The cops don't wear masks. They just would not comply.
[1:47:57.680 --> 1:48:00.680]  So if they were to try to do something like this,
[1:48:00.680 --> 1:48:02.680]  they'd have to bring in an exterior force.
[1:48:02.680 --> 1:48:06.680]  And that's the key. Where you have regular cops in libertarian
[1:48:06.680 --> 1:48:08.680]  and conservative areas, they're the leaders. They get it all.
[1:48:08.680 --> 1:48:10.680]  But in leftist areas, they're total oppressors.
[1:48:10.680 --> 1:48:13.680]  You know, in Canada, the U.S. and Britain, we've got the videos.
[1:48:13.680 --> 1:48:16.680]  They're building whole cities for the new quarantines.
[1:48:16.680 --> 1:48:21.680]  Yes, I saw that on your show the other day, which is pretty disturbing.
[1:48:21.680 --> 1:48:23.680]  But I've paused this thing.
[1:48:23.680 --> 1:48:26.680]  By the way, that was a caller. We just Googled what she said.
[1:48:26.680 --> 1:48:29.680]  We went and checked. It's all true. They're building giant death camps
[1:48:29.680 --> 1:48:32.680]  all over the world, brother. That's why I'm like, that's why.
[1:48:32.680 --> 1:48:34.680]  That's why. What are we supposed to do now?
[1:48:34.680 --> 1:48:37.680]  It's scary. Well, you know, I go back to Stoyetkin
[1:48:37.680 --> 1:48:42.680]  and the gulag archipelago and he mentioned the fact that if people had stood up
[1:48:42.680 --> 1:48:45.680]  as it within communities,
[1:48:45.680 --> 1:48:47.680]  I don't want to interrupt you, but pull it up.
[1:48:47.680 --> 1:48:50.680]  Pull it up for me on screen. Oh, how we burn to the camps.
[1:48:50.680 --> 1:48:53.680]  Alexander Sholzenitsyn put the quote up.
[1:48:53.680 --> 1:48:56.680]  If they would just attack when it started, it wouldn't have happened.
[1:48:56.680 --> 1:49:00.680]  Correct. But you see people that, you know, right now it's like,
[1:49:00.680 --> 1:49:03.680]  don't advocate violence, but you have the right to defend yourself.
[1:49:03.680 --> 1:49:06.680]  Well, I see. They're coming with a poison shot.
[1:49:06.680 --> 1:49:09.680]  Do I blame the, like they said, I'm a black person.
[1:49:09.680 --> 1:49:13.680]  They hired me because I'm black. So you trust this shot that the black guy
[1:49:13.680 --> 1:49:16.680]  coming to your door for $12 an hour trying to give you a shot.
[1:49:16.680 --> 1:49:18.680]  It's not your enemy. He isn't part of that.
[1:49:18.680 --> 1:49:21.680]  So they hope we kill him, see, to create.
[1:49:21.680 --> 1:49:24.680]  Oh, now, now of your anti-vaxxure terrorists.
[1:49:24.680 --> 1:49:26.680]  Yeah, it works. Yeah, it works.
[1:49:26.680 --> 1:49:29.680]  We should love that brother human, whether they're black or white or brown
[1:49:29.680 --> 1:49:32.680]  that comes to our door and explain it to them.
[1:49:32.680 --> 1:49:34.680]  We should not hurt them. They're not the UN.
[1:49:34.680 --> 1:49:36.680]  They're not the globalists.
[1:49:36.680 --> 1:49:40.680]  They're hoping sending out millions of these poor people to our doors
[1:49:40.680 --> 1:49:43.680]  that some of them are going to get hurt.
[1:49:43.680 --> 1:49:48.680]  Yes. And what I think will happen is people won't submit in these areas.
[1:49:48.680 --> 1:49:51.680]  People have already decided if they want the shot or don't.
[1:49:51.680 --> 1:49:53.680]  And they want to make people feel alone.
[1:49:53.680 --> 1:49:56.680]  So you feel, oh, I'm ostracized. I'm the one man out.
[1:49:56.680 --> 1:49:58.680]  Maybe I should join.
[1:49:58.680 --> 1:50:02.680]  And but these rural communities tend to be the way they want.
[1:50:02.680 --> 1:50:05.680]  I see people growing. I hate to say victory gardens like World War Two.
[1:50:05.680 --> 1:50:10.680]  I've seen more gardens being grown now than I have ever in my entire life.
[1:50:10.680 --> 1:50:14.680]  Everyone instinctively is going to the country, black, white, old, young.
[1:50:14.680 --> 1:50:17.680]  Everybody's growing stuff. We get it, don't we?
[1:50:17.680 --> 1:50:22.680]  Yes. And so when they think that they're going to do this as, you know,
[1:50:22.680 --> 1:50:26.680]  in war, one of the best laid plans is you can plan everything out
[1:50:26.680 --> 1:50:29.680]  and it goes to hell after the first shot.
[1:50:29.680 --> 1:50:34.680]  And so they, they're trying to be careful, but all it takes is, you know,
[1:50:34.680 --> 1:50:38.680]  they're on a razor's edge and all it takes is a little push either way.
[1:50:38.680 --> 1:50:41.680]  And so they're pushing for that right now.
[1:50:41.680 --> 1:50:44.680]  And if they're not careful, they're going to wake more people up.
[1:50:44.680 --> 1:50:47.680]  I think they're being reckless because 2022.
[1:50:47.680 --> 1:50:51.680]  I agree. And I always go with my spiritual energy because I have an electoral prowess
[1:50:51.680 --> 1:50:56.680]  and we all have that. I have my, but my spiritual level is on fire for war.
[1:50:56.680 --> 1:50:59.680]  And I'm trying to control myself, but it's like, you know what I mean?
[1:50:59.680 --> 1:51:04.680]  I mean, I'm ready to kick some ass, but I'm going to control myself and focus that
[1:51:04.680 --> 1:51:06.680]  into information. What are you going to do?
[1:51:06.680 --> 1:51:09.680]  Well, as of right now, I've been actually getting myself healthy.
[1:51:09.680 --> 1:51:14.680]  I've been preparing, I buy your products. Your shirts are great, by the way.
[1:51:14.680 --> 1:51:16.680]  They're some of the best shirts I've ever worn.
[1:51:16.680 --> 1:51:20.680]  They don't fly up after they've been washed a bunch of times.
[1:51:20.680 --> 1:51:25.680]  I've got my own garden. I've been teaching my children how to survive
[1:51:25.680 --> 1:51:27.680]  out in the woods as extreme as that might sound.
[1:51:27.680 --> 1:51:31.680]  But people in cities have lost how to do basic things.
[1:51:31.680 --> 1:51:35.680]  We've got to go back to, and that's the thing is they take it weird that we're upset about this.
[1:51:35.680 --> 1:51:39.680]  Our basic rights, this evil group coming out for us. It's normal to get pissed.
[1:51:39.680 --> 1:51:42.680]  We have this energy to get angry. God bless you. I appreciate your call.
[1:51:42.680 --> 1:51:45.680]  All right. Thank you, Cody.
[1:51:45.680 --> 1:51:48.680]  And I'm wild today. I'm sorry. The energy levels just off the charts right now.
[1:51:48.680 --> 1:51:51.680]  Whatever's going on behind the scenes.
[1:51:51.680 --> 1:51:55.680]  Dixon and Canada, you're on the air. Thanks for holding. Welcome.
[1:51:55.680 --> 1:51:58.680]  Alex. Yes, sir.
[1:51:58.680 --> 1:52:01.680]  Great to talk to you. You know, you have a rare spirit.
[1:52:01.680 --> 1:52:05.680]  It's the Phineas spirit. I'm sure you know what I mean.
[1:52:05.680 --> 1:52:12.680]  It's rare, but it's alive in the USA, and you're not alone.
[1:52:12.680 --> 1:52:16.680]  You're inspiring a lot of people, and don't ever forget that,
[1:52:16.680 --> 1:52:21.680]  even if it sounds like you're a voice crying in the wilderness by yourself.
[1:52:21.680 --> 1:52:24.680]  There are a lot here, and things are going to start changing.
[1:52:24.680 --> 1:52:31.680]  What I wanted to talk about was the inflection point that is coming this fall
[1:52:31.680 --> 1:52:38.680]  with these internment camps and these door-to-door canvassing to put it politely.
[1:52:38.680 --> 1:52:42.680]  This is all... Yeah, that's just the normalization. Next, it's taking people away.
[1:52:42.680 --> 1:52:45.680]  They admit that. So explain to them what's about to happen.
[1:52:45.680 --> 1:52:50.680]  Yes, and you know, I'm here in Canada, and we've had these camps being built now
[1:52:50.680 --> 1:52:57.680]  since, well, they were publicly acknowledged in the legislature a year ago.
[1:52:57.680 --> 1:53:00.680]  But the government wouldn't talk about it. They wouldn't answer any questions,
[1:53:00.680 --> 1:53:02.680]  and they're still not.
[1:53:02.680 --> 1:53:09.680]  But Alex, what I wanted to say is we've been here before, in our ancient past,
[1:53:09.680 --> 1:53:17.680]  when Israel was marching out of the New World Order of that day out of Egypt.
[1:53:17.680 --> 1:53:20.680]  We were in the same predicament.
[1:53:20.680 --> 1:53:30.680]  The firstborn of Israel were being killed, and the plan was to exterminate all of Israel.
[1:53:30.680 --> 1:53:34.680]  And whether you're native-born or whether you're grafted in really doesn't matter.
[1:53:34.680 --> 1:53:40.680]  We know who real Israel is, and we're following the same pattern today,
[1:53:40.680 --> 1:53:44.680]  and we can learn a lot from the template that's in the Scripture.
[1:53:44.680 --> 1:53:48.680]  There are at least seven different prophets that talk about it.
[1:53:48.680 --> 1:53:51.680]  Way too many for me to cover.
[1:53:51.680 --> 1:53:53.680]  Well, I'm going to hold you over because you're right.
[1:53:53.680 --> 1:53:57.680]  The parallels, the Ramses II and the Exodus is happening,
[1:53:57.680 --> 1:54:03.680]  and it is exactly what's going on because the Bible repeats itself towards the big event.
[1:54:03.680 --> 1:54:06.680]  So we're going to come back to Dixon, and then I promise,
[1:54:06.680 --> 1:54:12.680]  William, Barbara, Bob, Luke, first time, Gail, James, Jerry, Boomer.
[1:54:12.680 --> 1:54:14.680]  I'm going to go on the order your calls came in.
[1:54:14.680 --> 1:54:16.680]  That's from order top to down.
[1:54:16.680 --> 1:54:18.680]  We're going to take your calls on the other side.
[1:54:18.680 --> 1:54:20.680]  I want to thank the listeners for keeping us on air.
[1:54:20.680 --> 1:54:22.680]  Without you, we wouldn't be here.
[1:54:22.680 --> 1:54:24.680]  And it's just such an amazing time.
[1:54:24.680 --> 1:54:26.680]  I mean, it's all being confirmed.
[1:54:26.680 --> 1:54:27.680]  We're reading your text messages.
[1:54:27.680 --> 1:54:28.680]  We're going to take your children.
[1:54:28.680 --> 1:54:30.680]  We're going to kill you.
[1:54:30.680 --> 1:54:32.680]  It's just unbelievable, fabulous evil.
[1:54:32.680 --> 1:54:33.680]  Oh, you're Cuban.
[1:54:33.680 --> 1:54:35.680]  You can't come to America, says Biden.
[1:54:35.680 --> 1:54:38.680]  I mean, it's just insane evil.
[1:54:38.680 --> 1:54:42.680]  It's all out in the open now.
[1:54:42.680 --> 1:54:46.680]  X-2 has been our number one bestseller over the years.
[1:54:46.680 --> 1:54:48.680]  Deep Earth Crystal iodine, the good halogen,
[1:54:48.680 --> 1:54:51.680]  it is essential for all actions in the body.
[1:54:51.680 --> 1:54:53.680]  You must have it to live.
[1:54:53.680 --> 1:54:55.680]  The UN estimates 2 billion plus people have cognitive disabilities
[1:54:55.680 --> 1:54:57.680]  because they don't have enough iodine.
[1:54:57.680 --> 1:55:00.680]  We have X-2 at two different bottles, the same amount in each bottle,
[1:55:00.680 --> 1:55:03.680]  but one has a spray top, one has a dropper top.
[1:55:03.680 --> 1:55:07.680]  60% off on the spray top, 40% off on the dropper top
[1:55:07.680 --> 1:55:10.680]  for a limited time because they're both selling out.
[1:55:10.680 --> 1:55:12.680]  I want to thank all the supporters that have gotten these over the years.
[1:55:12.680 --> 1:55:13.680]  They're amazing.
[1:55:13.680 --> 1:55:15.680]  So that's a great deal for you to stock up on it.
[1:55:15.680 --> 1:55:18.680]  But this deal is really for folks that have been on the fence
[1:55:18.680 --> 1:55:21.680]  and haven't experienced the good halogen for yourself.
[1:55:21.680 --> 1:55:23.680]  So, X-2 in the dropper bottle and the spray bottle,
[1:55:23.680 --> 1:55:27.680]  60% and 40% off for a limited time because it's selling out right now
[1:55:27.680 --> 1:55:30.680]  at infowarstore.com, but we're going to keep this deal going
[1:55:30.680 --> 1:55:32.680]  until it sells out and probably take about two weeks.
[1:55:32.680 --> 1:55:33.680]  Don't procrastinate.

[1:56:26.920 --> 1:56:30.500]  If a war store.com beats out all the rest.

[1:56:42.800 --> 1:56:44.500]  That's infowarstore.com.
[1:56:44.500 --> 1:56:49.500]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:57:15.500 --> 1:57:22.500]  We expect the same, but no one's looking for anything
[1:57:23.500 --> 1:57:26.500]  Closer protesting in Miami against communism
[1:57:28.500 --> 1:57:30.500]  Against the total enslavement
[1:57:30.500 --> 1:57:33.500]  And of course, Joe Biden is not supporting it
[1:57:34.500 --> 1:57:36.500]  Because he's attiring
[1:57:37.500 --> 1:57:39.500]  Alright, let's go back to the callers here, Tixson and Canada
[1:57:39.500 --> 1:57:41.500]  You were making a point about the tipping point
[1:57:41.500 --> 1:57:44.500]  What's going to happen next? Please tell me your view on it
[1:57:44.500 --> 1:57:49.500]  Yes, so our march out of Egypt back then was a seven day march
[1:57:50.500 --> 1:57:54.500]  And the latter fulfillment of it is on a much bigger scale
[1:57:54.500 --> 1:58:00.500]  It's a seven year march and it began in 2017 with Trump's presidency
[1:58:00.500 --> 1:58:05.500]  So we all know what happened on the sixth day with Farrow's army
[1:58:05.500 --> 1:58:07.500]  And on the seventh day with the deliverance
[1:58:07.500 --> 1:58:11.500]  But there are more details given in the book of Jasher
[1:58:11.500 --> 1:58:13.500]  I don't know if you've ever read it, chapter 81
[1:58:13.500 --> 1:58:19.500]  It's a history book that the Bible refers to as recommended reading on two separate occasions
[1:58:20.500 --> 1:58:26.500]  And what it tells us is that on the fourth day, which was 2020
[1:58:27.500 --> 1:58:34.500]  The Egyptian slave owners, not Farrow's army, but the slave owners banded together
[1:58:34.500 --> 1:58:36.500]  There were about 700,000 of them
[1:58:36.500 --> 1:58:42.500]  And they set out to overtake Israel in the wilderness and to force them back into servitude
[1:58:43.500 --> 1:58:48.500]  And they overtook them on, they arrived at the end of the fourth day
[1:58:49.500 --> 1:58:52.500]  And on the fifth day, which is this year
[1:58:53.500 --> 1:58:59.500]  God strengthened the hand of Israel to fight against those slave owners and overcome them
[1:58:59.500 --> 1:59:04.500]  And kill many of them and sent the rest humiliated back to Farrow
[1:59:04.500 --> 1:59:08.500]  And that's what triggered Farrow to then send his whole army out a couple of days later
[1:59:09.500 --> 1:59:14.500]  So the important thing to note there, this is the fifth year
[1:59:14.500 --> 1:59:16.500]  This is the fifth day
[1:59:16.500 --> 1:59:22.500]  And when you map a year to a day, the first six months of the year correspond to the nighttime portion
[1:59:22.500 --> 1:59:25.500]  Because the day runs from sunset to sunset
[1:59:25.500 --> 1:59:29.500]  And the last six months correspond to the daytime portion
[1:59:29.500 --> 1:59:35.500]  Now we just started the fifth month of the year yesterday, or the day before
[1:59:35.500 --> 1:59:45.500]  So the turning point when we hit the daylight portion of this fifth day starts in around September 9
[1:59:45.500 --> 1:59:52.500]  And there is coming an inflection point when God is going to strengthen the hand of Israel
[1:59:52.500 --> 1:59:55.500]  To overcome this, at least within the USA
[1:59:55.500 --> 1:59:58.500]  Maybe not Canada, not elsewhere
[1:59:58.500 --> 2:00:03.500]  This is specific to the tribe of the USA
[2:00:03.500 --> 2:00:09.500]  And the internal traders, the CCP loyalists
[2:00:09.500 --> 2:00:15.500]  And those that have come against us to bring us back into slavery starting last year
[2:00:15.500 --> 2:00:19.500]  And you know, the lockdowns began right at the new year, the biblical new year
[2:00:19.500 --> 2:00:23.500]  Which is right around the middle of March, usually
[2:00:23.500 --> 2:00:29.500]  Right on time, the time queues are all there, we can know what is going to happen
[2:00:29.500 --> 2:00:32.500]  Well that's what's amazing, whether you believe in the Old Testament or not
[2:00:32.500 --> 2:00:35.500]  The globalists follow it and they manifest it
[2:00:35.500 --> 2:00:39.500]  World government, cashless society, Mark of the Beast
[2:00:39.500 --> 2:00:42.500]  The Bible says there will be three major regions, ten kingdoms
[2:00:42.500 --> 2:00:45.500]  The UN sets up three regions, ten kingdoms
[2:00:45.500 --> 2:00:48.500]  They're following it
[2:00:48.500 --> 2:00:53.500]  And that actually brings me to another strong point
[2:00:53.500 --> 2:00:56.500]  In Daniel 7, the four beasts
[2:00:56.500 --> 2:00:59.500]  The scholars would tell us that, oh that's just ancient history
[2:00:59.500 --> 2:01:02.500]  But it's not, and Daniel tells us it's not
[2:01:02.500 --> 2:01:05.500]  Because he tells us in verses 11 and 12
[2:01:05.500 --> 2:01:11.500]  That when Christ comes back, the fourth beast is slain and given to the flames
[2:01:11.500 --> 2:01:15.500]  But the first three beasts are kept alive
[2:01:15.500 --> 2:01:20.500]  Their dominions are taken away, but they go on into the millennium for a season at a time
[2:01:20.500 --> 2:01:25.500]  At a time, so we know that they are end time contemporaries
[2:01:25.500 --> 2:01:27.500]  They are not ancient history
[2:01:27.500 --> 2:01:30.500]  And the first of those is the line with eagle's wings
[2:01:30.500 --> 2:01:33.500]  And that, the eagle is America
[2:01:33.500 --> 2:01:37.500]  And there's only one other place in scripture where that same
[2:01:37.500 --> 2:01:41.500]  When the bear tears out three ribs
[2:01:41.500 --> 2:01:44.500]  And it tears those ribs out of the eagle
[2:01:44.500 --> 2:01:47.500]  Because that's how the eagle gets its heart transplant
[2:01:47.500 --> 2:01:49.500]  You have to remove those ribs
[2:01:49.500 --> 2:02:15.500]  Alright Mike, thank you
[2:02:19.500 --> 2:02:24.860]  We'll start off by telling you about the new five-star capture
[2:02:24.860 --> 2:02:30.500]  One as a dropper cap for 60 and 40 percent off, depending on which one
[2:02:30.500 --> 2:02:32.500]  They're both excellent at InfoWarsHore.com
[2:02:32.500 --> 2:02:34.500]  The 60 percent off of the spray bottle is unprecedented
[2:02:34.500 --> 2:02:37.500]  But I want you to experience the power of the good halogen
[2:02:37.500 --> 2:02:39.500]  And learn about the iodine conspiracy
[2:02:39.500 --> 2:02:41.500]  It's all available at InfoWarsHore.com
[2:02:41.500 --> 2:02:45.500]  The new green fiber capsules, 50 percent off, and X2

[2:02:58.540 --> 2:03:07.060]  The answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:03:08.780 --> 2:03:12.080]  All right, I want to get her back up sometime to go host the whole show with me

[2:03:17.620 --> 2:03:20.140]  Melissa Tate is a Christian conservative author

[2:03:47.140 --> 2:03:48.980]  choice
[2:03:48.980 --> 2:03:51.660]  Exed out privilege choice white privilege
[2:03:51.860 --> 2:03:58.460]  What's race got to do with it and she's here with us to talk about all the craziness happening in the world and I know
[2:03:58.460 --> 2:04:02.900]  She's been a big defender of free speech. She's been speaking. I've been a big fan of hers for several years
[2:04:02.900 --> 2:04:06.980]  I've known about her and it's just really great to have you here. There's so many questions. I've got that. Wow
[2:04:06.980 --> 2:04:08.980]  What a time to be alive oh?
[2:04:08.980 --> 2:04:14.540]  Well, thank you so much for having me Alex. Yeah, everything that's happening is just really surreal
[2:04:14.540 --> 2:04:17.380]  Just watching everything that's taking place has just been
[2:04:18.300 --> 2:04:19.660]  absolutely
[2:04:19.660 --> 2:04:21.660]  surreal I mean I used to
[2:04:22.100 --> 2:04:26.580]  Watch some of your videos and I used to think oh, I think Alex is going a little too far
[2:04:26.580 --> 2:04:33.420]  But I don't think you went far enough. It's just been so crazy. I just feel like I've woken up in like Twilight Zone or
[2:04:34.420 --> 2:04:36.420]  Some sort of a dystopic movie
[2:04:36.420 --> 2:04:38.700]  But yeah, it's it's been crazy
[2:04:39.580 --> 2:04:44.460]  How did you wake up because you mean you reach millions of people now you got a best-selling bug
[2:04:44.460 --> 2:04:48.300]  I mean, what was your process of waking up? What formed your your views?
[2:04:49.420 --> 2:04:52.160]  So when I moved to the United States, I obvious
[2:04:52.860 --> 2:04:55.700]  immediately I aligned with the Republican Party because you know
[2:04:56.220 --> 2:05:01.580]  The Zimbabweans are very conservative. I was raised very Christian very conservative very traditional
[2:05:01.580 --> 2:05:05.980]  So when I moved here, I automatically said well, I guess I'm a Republican
[2:05:05.980 --> 2:05:13.460]  So I was all for George Bush and all of that and then I kind of started to notice that both party because I've always been very
[2:05:13.700 --> 2:05:16.380]  You know interested in politics, but not involved
[2:05:16.580 --> 2:05:21.420]  So I just always used to kind of follow follow it and then during the Tea Party movement
[2:05:21.420 --> 2:05:25.820]  I started to notice that there was like, you know a division between like the
[2:05:25.940 --> 2:05:30.620]  Republicans that are really for the people and then the Republicans that are just kind of more establishment
[2:05:30.620 --> 2:05:34.500]  So that's when I think I started to wake up and then I actually saw one of your
[2:05:35.340 --> 2:05:41.140]  Documentaries the Obama deception and that kind of opened up my mind to other issues and stuff
[2:05:41.140 --> 2:05:42.340]  So I was like oh wow
[2:05:42.340 --> 2:05:45.020]  So that that was kind of my journey in waking up
[2:05:45.020 --> 2:05:52.020]  But really I had kind of checked out of politics for the most part because I just felt like both parties were corrupt and then
[2:05:52.940 --> 2:05:58.300]  2016 I mean 2016 is when I got excited. I mean, I wasn't immediately on the Trump train
[2:05:58.300 --> 2:06:03.340]  But when Trump started going I was like that's the guy who's gonna take down, you know, both parties
[2:06:03.340 --> 2:06:09.420]  He's gonna take on the Republican establishment. He's gonna take on the Democrat establishment and the most important is the media
[2:06:09.740 --> 2:06:13.620]  so I immediately got on the Trump train and then I
[2:06:14.140 --> 2:06:19.980]  Would hear that Trump tweeted this Trump tweeted that so I was like let me get on this Twitter to see what he's saying for myself
[2:06:19.980 --> 2:06:22.660]  So I logged on to Twitter created an account
[2:06:22.660 --> 2:06:29.180]  I started to connect with other conservatives on Twitter and then I started tweeting out my own thoughts and you know
[2:06:29.620 --> 2:06:35.460]  Posting just basically being a digital warrior and exposing all the lies that the media was saying about Trump
[2:06:35.460 --> 2:06:39.340]  And then I started growing a really big following so before you knew it
[2:06:39.340 --> 2:06:41.340]  I had like hundreds of thousands of followers
[2:06:41.460 --> 2:06:44.460]  President Trump is retweeting me and before you know it
[2:06:44.460 --> 2:06:48.180]  I'm at the White House taking a selfie with the president of the United States
[2:06:48.180 --> 2:06:53.420]  So if you would have told me that when I was a little girl going growing up in Zimbabwe that I'd be at the White House
[2:06:53.420 --> 2:06:57.620]  Taking a selfie with the president of the United States. I would have said that's great news. So
[2:06:58.220 --> 2:07:00.380]  So it's been an incredible journey, but
[2:07:01.420 --> 2:07:06.620]  Yeah, so that's kind of my story as far as how I listen you just said it all
[2:07:07.140 --> 2:07:11.180]  You would have had those talents in Zimbabwe, but you wouldn't have had the opportunities
[2:07:11.180 --> 2:07:15.420]  It's that it's not that America gave you this you came to a place where you would be recognized
[2:07:15.420 --> 2:07:21.060]  And then when you got here people immediately recognize you're smart. You're well-spoken. You're beautiful
[2:07:21.060 --> 2:07:25.420]  We love you and that's what scares the left is they want to try to make us all at each other's throats
[2:07:25.420 --> 2:07:32.020]  We were all just ready to come together and be successful and love God and justice and that's why they that's why they try to suppress you
[2:07:32.020 --> 2:07:32.580]  But you're right
[2:07:32.580 --> 2:07:39.300]  How many other amazing people are there like you of every race color and creator all human that we don't know about that?
[2:07:39.300 --> 2:07:44.020]  That's what's so amazing. I'm just glad you you stepped up so we get to know you
[2:07:44.020 --> 2:07:49.860]  Well, I had Alex you're absolutely right. So when I came to the United States, you know
[2:07:49.860 --> 2:07:52.260]  this was like a great opportunity for me and
[2:07:52.740 --> 2:07:59.700]  Just coming here with nothing three hundred dollars in my pocket a suitcase full of clothes. I arrived in the United States
[2:07:59.700 --> 2:08:06.080]  I work hard determination. That's just what my mother taught me, you know, so I work my way through college
[2:08:06.080 --> 2:08:10.020]  It was a supernatural thing because actually when I came to the United States
[2:08:10.020 --> 2:08:15.620]  It was during a time that my own country was having this economic collapse of devastating
[2:08:15.780 --> 2:08:17.780]  Propulsions and I'm sure you know a lot about that
[2:08:18.060 --> 2:08:22.020]  But so obviously my mom couldn't afford to send me to the United States
[2:08:22.020 --> 2:08:27.700]  But I came here by faith because my mom believed that I would be able to work hard and God would super naturally
[2:08:27.940 --> 2:08:33.060]  Provide and he did and I was able to pay my way through college. I graduated. I
[2:08:33.740 --> 2:08:35.740]  Got a good job. I
[2:08:35.740 --> 2:08:40.100]  I started my own business and by the time I was 27 years old
[2:08:40.100 --> 2:08:45.580]  I had a business that was doing seven figures, you know, I had multiple employees living the American dream
[2:08:45.860 --> 2:08:53.340]  So when I start to hear this narrative that America's systemically racist and oppressive and evil and white supremacist
[2:08:53.340 --> 2:08:57.980]  I'm like that is not true. That is not the America that I know that is not
[2:08:57.980 --> 2:09:03.780]  I mean, let me imagine I bet I bet you have to beat people off of the stick just for business everything because you're a smart dynamic
[2:09:03.780 --> 2:09:07.580]  Beautiful woman exactly like this idea. It's just not true. Is it?
[2:09:08.380 --> 2:09:14.140]  No, it's absolutely not true. And that's and that's you know, it really grieves my heart and during the time
[2:09:15.660 --> 2:09:19.940]  2020 is where I feel like there was a it was a turning point, you know during the George Floyd
[2:09:20.660 --> 2:09:27.500]  Tragedy that happened and in the ensuing riots and all this stuff, you know how the left just took advantage of that and
[2:09:27.500 --> 2:09:33.540]  Took that as an opportunity to smear the country as a systemically racist and evil nation
[2:09:33.540 --> 2:09:39.460]  And for the first time this was the first time that I started to hear this narrative in the mainstream because I used to see
[2:09:39.460 --> 2:09:42.580]  You know in the echo chambers fall left echo chambers of Twitter
[2:09:43.580 --> 2:09:44.220]  academia
[2:09:44.220 --> 2:09:49.300]  But for the first time I was starting to hear my friends and family parrot these talking points of
[2:09:49.300 --> 2:09:55.140]  So for me what it is is a bunch of weird white academic liberals stealing black people's identity and claiming
[2:09:55.140 --> 2:09:59.100]  They represent any problems you have that's I mean look at these weird-ass white people
[2:09:59.820 --> 2:10:01.820]  Worshiping George Floyd. That's a cult
[2:10:02.420 --> 2:10:07.980]  Yes, absolutely. And that's the thing, you know, it's mostly driven by white people with the white liberals
[2:10:08.660 --> 2:10:13.340]  You know that drive this and so I when I when all this started happening
[2:10:13.340 --> 2:10:17.300]  I just got so frustrated just seeing all the ignorance that was around me
[2:10:17.460 --> 2:10:22.060]  My pastor started putting up black lives matter decals on the windows of the church
[2:10:22.060 --> 2:10:29.700]  Apologizing for his white privilege. I mean it just blew my mind and I got so frustrated and that's when I
[2:10:30.300 --> 2:10:35.940]  You know in my frustration the Lord just spoke to me and said write a book about it and educate people because you know
[2:10:35.940 --> 2:10:37.940]  I'm somebody who follows
[2:10:38.100 --> 2:10:44.260]  Politics very closely. So I know black lives matter is an organization that does nothing for black people
[2:10:44.260 --> 2:10:50.940]  But I mean they do very little if anything. I mean, this is an organization that mostly raises funds for you know fall left
[2:10:50.940 --> 2:10:52.900]  causes
[2:10:52.900 --> 2:10:56.820]  You know like abortion and all these things that are really anti-black
[2:10:56.940 --> 2:11:03.180]  So I know this but the average person who maybe gets their information from like, you know sound bites off media
[2:11:03.420 --> 2:11:08.460]  You know, they don't know this a lot of people don't pay attention to politics. They just get their little sound bites
[2:11:08.740 --> 2:11:11.740]  So I was like, you know what I need to educate particularly
[2:11:11.740 --> 2:11:16.220]  You know even Christians and conservatives because you know, they were falling for this and they're thinking oh well
[2:11:16.220 --> 2:11:19.100]  I need to help black people. I even had people call me. Oh
[2:11:19.100 --> 2:11:24.180]  Oh, how do you how do you feel about George Floyd's death? How does that affect you? I'm like, you know
[2:11:24.860 --> 2:11:28.780]  That doesn't affect me. That's not who I am. That's not who my children are
[2:11:28.780 --> 2:11:33.020]  That's not how I raise my children to live my their lives like that and to me
[2:11:33.020 --> 2:11:39.020]  It's kind of patronizing for somebody to say that because somebody who's black was killed who was in this situation
[2:11:39.660 --> 2:11:45.660]  Now I should feel that same way and it's mostly, you know, white liberals who come up and say these kinds of things
[2:11:45.660 --> 2:11:50.700]  So I thought you know what? I need to write a book about this. So I did so I wrote the book choice privilege
[2:11:50.700 --> 2:11:53.740]  And basically it's a play on the words white privilege
[2:11:53.740 --> 2:12:00.380]  I cross out where it says white and I put in choice because in my experience and what I've seen in America
[2:12:00.380 --> 2:12:05.260]  It's not the color of your skin that determines your destiny and the quality of your life
[2:12:05.260 --> 2:12:08.780]  It is the choices that you make I came here with nothing
[2:12:08.780 --> 2:12:12.860]  I made really good choices because my mother instilled in me values that
[2:12:12.860 --> 2:12:19.340]  That the choices that you make is really what's going to determine your destiny and your life
[2:12:19.660 --> 2:12:25.500]  So that's just the attitude I came over here with my mother was like, you know, the world doesn't owe you anything
[2:12:26.060 --> 2:12:29.420]  So well, let's say I'm sold and your book's amazing
[2:12:29.660 --> 2:12:34.860]  Let's come back and look at what's contemporarily happening and your idea is how to fix it and how to bring people together
[2:12:34.860 --> 2:12:38.860]  Because what you're doing is amazing for an ambassador humanity of real unity
[2:12:38.860 --> 2:12:45.900]  Not division. We'll be right back with the author of choice privilege. Stay with us. Felicitate is on fire

[2:15:19.100 --> 2:15:21.100]  Don't know much about the french I've stuck

[2:15:26.140 --> 2:15:31.580]  And I know that if you love me too for the wonderful world this would be
[2:15:33.580 --> 2:15:36.060]  Don't know much about geography
[2:15:37.340 --> 2:15:39.820]  Don't know much about trigonometry
[2:15:41.100 --> 2:15:43.580]  Don't know much about algebra
[2:15:44.860 --> 2:15:47.340]  Don't know what a slide through is for
[2:15:47.340 --> 2:15:50.940]  But I don't know what it is to
[2:15:52.220 --> 2:15:57.740]  And if this was to be with you for the wonderful world this would be
[2:15:58.700 --> 2:16:02.700]  Now I don't claim to be an a student
[2:16:03.500 --> 2:16:05.500]  But I'm trying to be
[2:16:06.540 --> 2:16:10.060]  For maybe by being an a student, baby
[2:16:10.860 --> 2:16:12.860]  I can win your love
[2:16:12.860 --> 2:16:17.340]  Unless it takes our guests hard to turn this great song off
[2:16:18.540 --> 2:16:23.580]  So looking at the clear cold-blooded attempt to create division this country
[2:16:24.460 --> 2:16:28.140]  You're a world travel person. You're a successful person of your own right. That's what I respect
[2:16:28.540 --> 2:16:31.660]  I want your advice. What what do you say to america? How do we fix this?
[2:16:32.140 --> 2:16:37.340]  How do we stop the democrats? I mean, I think get the republican strong and to stop being on defense
[2:16:37.900 --> 2:16:40.620]  When we get called racist because we're just promoting freedom
[2:16:40.620 --> 2:16:47.100]  And and and really getting the democrats face with what they're doing because promoting racial division is the racism of my view
[2:16:48.780 --> 2:16:54.140]  No, you're absolutely right and the answer is really for people to start being politically active
[2:16:54.780 --> 2:16:59.020]  You know, uh, just sitting around in the sidelines doesn't work anymore
[2:16:59.420 --> 2:17:03.340]  Politics is no longer a spectator sport. It has to be all hands on deck
[2:17:03.740 --> 2:17:07.420]  That means every person needs to be figuring out. What do I need to do?
[2:17:07.420 --> 2:17:12.380]  What can I do and that's the questions that I was asking myself when everything was happening
[2:17:12.460 --> 2:17:16.140]  I was like, what can I do and that's what prompted me to write the book?
[2:17:16.140 --> 2:17:19.260]  I was like, let me write a book. Let me get out there. Let me do something
[2:17:19.260 --> 2:17:24.300]  But for everybody it's going to look different on what god has called them to do in this fight
[2:17:24.940 --> 2:17:30.620]  So everybody has to start being politically active people have to stop being afraid of being called names
[2:17:31.100 --> 2:17:34.140]  You know, whatever racist names that whatever names that the
[2:17:34.140 --> 2:17:39.100]  Left is going to throw at you racist white supremacists all these things
[2:17:39.500 --> 2:17:42.140]  We have to stop being afraid of being called names
[2:17:42.140 --> 2:17:48.380]  We have to stop being afraid of cancel culture because really if everything they're trying to achieve happens
[2:17:48.780 --> 2:17:53.660]  The consequences of that are going to be 10 times worse than what it is for you to be canceled
[2:17:53.980 --> 2:18:00.060]  Before you to be called names. I get called names all the time, but it doesn't stop me from speaking the truth
[2:18:00.060 --> 2:18:06.460]  And let me just say this Melissa. It's not just that you're a beautiful woman and a mother and married and so successful
[2:18:06.860 --> 2:18:10.220]  The fact that you came from adversity overcame adversity
[2:18:11.260 --> 2:18:17.020]  I wouldn't call that sexy because it's not even it's not it's not like a sexual thing. It's it's it's very attractive
[2:18:17.580 --> 2:18:20.380]  Very attractive. You're like an american success story
[2:18:20.700 --> 2:18:23.340]  Just like anything america like some poor guy
[2:18:23.900 --> 2:18:28.940]  Grows up wherever ends up being a top race car driver by his own bootstraps. He could be black Hispanic white
[2:18:28.940 --> 2:18:31.100]  I don't care. It's like attractive
[2:18:31.500 --> 2:18:37.180]  And I look at you the democratic party could easily be full of great diana people like you but they don't want that
[2:18:37.340 --> 2:18:43.660]  They want aoc people that are repulsive not because she's hispanic beautiful hispanic people. She's just something
[2:18:44.540 --> 2:18:46.940]  Joe biden's repulsive. It's like
[2:18:48.780 --> 2:18:51.900]  It seems spiritual. Why can't people see the difference?
[2:18:53.260 --> 2:18:57.180]  No, you're absolutely right and the democrat party doesn't want that and really
[2:18:57.180 --> 2:19:01.740]  I mean the way we've been looking at this whole issue with the race and the critical race theory
[2:19:01.980 --> 2:19:05.740]  We've been looking at it from the standpoint of what it's doing to the country
[2:19:06.060 --> 2:19:08.140]  Which is evil in itself
[2:19:08.220 --> 2:19:11.420]  But what is it doing to the black community really what it's doing?
[2:19:11.420 --> 2:19:15.020]  It's designed to demoralize the black community as well
[2:19:15.420 --> 2:19:21.340]  Because if you're born and the first thing you're told is that you live in this oppressive society where the white man is out
[2:19:21.420 --> 2:19:24.140]  To get you you're never going to succeed. You're never going to achieve
[2:19:24.140 --> 2:19:30.060]  Anything you're never going to amount to anything because you don't have privilege and these people here have privilege
[2:19:30.380 --> 2:19:35.740]  So really when I look at critical race theory, I look at it as the black demoralization project
[2:19:36.140 --> 2:19:41.740]  That is the new project of the democrat party to destroy the black community and then weaponize
[2:19:42.220 --> 2:19:44.780]  the black community to destroy and take down
[2:19:45.340 --> 2:19:46.300]  the
[2:19:46.300 --> 2:19:50.060]  America basically american principles and western civilization
[2:19:50.060 --> 2:19:57.100]  And this is what I've seen just studying it for my book just the fact that critical race theory and this whole racial agenda
[2:19:57.420 --> 2:19:59.420]  It is really designed
[2:19:59.420 --> 2:20:04.780]  To tear down western civilization if you just boil it all the way down and that's what's happening
[2:20:05.260 --> 2:20:07.900]  So at the same time that they're destroying the country
[2:20:07.980 --> 2:20:13.180]  They're destroying the black community because they are totally demoralizing them telling them they can never
[2:20:13.820 --> 2:20:16.940]  Amount to anything because of racism and white supremacy
[2:20:16.940 --> 2:20:21.980]  I came here and I succeeded because my mother told me that I could become anything
[2:20:22.540 --> 2:20:27.500]  And everything I want to be if I'm willing to work hard and make good choices
[2:20:27.820 --> 2:20:32.300]  And that was a simple formula that I used and I came to the united states
[2:20:32.620 --> 2:20:36.860]  And I was able to make it and that's one thing that is very unique about the united states
[2:20:36.860 --> 2:20:42.380]  Is you can come here with nothing and you can have the determination and the worth work ethic
[2:20:42.380 --> 2:20:47.820]  And you can have you know all these things that that are innate in you and you can become something
[2:20:47.820 --> 2:20:50.860]  And that's very unique to the united states because I could have had the same
[2:20:51.980 --> 2:20:53.020]  determination
[2:20:53.020 --> 2:20:55.740]  And hard work ethic in in my country
[2:20:55.820 --> 2:21:01.500]  And I never would have been as successful there as I am here because they're very rigid the class systems
[2:21:01.500 --> 2:21:03.500]  They are very rigid so
[2:21:04.620 --> 2:21:06.620]  Yeah, sorry keep going
[2:21:07.100 --> 2:21:10.860]  Yeah, so basically if you're born poor you're you're most likely going to die poor
[2:21:10.860 --> 2:21:14.300]  So, um, America is very unique and I just wish
[2:21:14.860 --> 2:21:22.060]  Americans understood that and I wish that Americans would appreciate America because it is such a beacon of light
[2:21:22.620 --> 2:21:27.500]  and hope and freedom for the rest of the world and people who are able to make it here
[2:21:27.980 --> 2:21:33.500]  Are just like wow, what an opportunity that I can come here and make my make something of myself
[2:21:33.980 --> 2:21:39.820]  And you have a line of people that want to come here and become something and then you see Americans
[2:21:39.820 --> 2:21:41.420]  You know
[2:21:41.420 --> 2:21:47.180]  kneeling for the for the flag turning back on the national anthem and all these things and it's just
[2:21:47.980 --> 2:21:49.580]  unbelievable because
[2:21:49.580 --> 2:21:51.580]  Yeah, so it's just crazy
[2:21:53.180 --> 2:22:01.820]  You know to me what's what's what's amazing is is that these big corporations are hiding their corruption their death camps in china apple
[2:22:02.780 --> 2:22:05.500]  By funding black lives matter and it's so transparent
[2:22:05.500 --> 2:22:12.620]  I'm seeing polls that not just white america black america, but everybody is rejecting BLM now and really seeing that it's just a
[2:22:13.580 --> 2:22:15.660]  corporations trying to hide themselves between
[2:22:16.940 --> 2:22:18.940]  A black face. That's what I see happening
[2:22:19.580 --> 2:22:24.140]  Yeah, absolutely and and black people are starting to wake up to black lives matter as well
[2:22:24.300 --> 2:22:28.860]  You know, you saw the founder of black lives matter just bought a whole bunch of million dollar houses
[2:22:29.420 --> 2:22:33.980]  You know, they're just blowing living large and nothing has happened for the black community all the
[2:22:33.980 --> 2:22:41.820]  The communities that they have destroyed and looted are still laying in ruins while they're living high on the hog buying all these fancy houses
[2:22:42.220 --> 2:22:45.900]  And then there's another gentleman that um was talking about education
[2:22:45.900 --> 2:22:51.180]  He was part of the black lives matter organization and then he went after education
[2:22:51.740 --> 2:22:57.180]  Which is the one thing you don't want to go after when you're in the democrat party because they want you
[2:22:57.820 --> 2:23:00.860]  To criticize the system, but they don't want you to exit it
[2:23:00.860 --> 2:23:05.580]  So they will let you criticize the white supremacist system or whatever
[2:23:05.580 --> 2:23:09.260]  But if anyone stands up and says well, we need to exit the school system
[2:23:09.580 --> 2:23:11.900]  We need to exit the white supremacist school system
[2:23:12.300 --> 2:23:18.060]  That's what he basically said and you know, that's the teachers unions and that's that's that's where which by the way is
[2:23:18.060 --> 2:23:20.060]  Based on eugenics and planned parenthood
[2:23:20.460 --> 2:23:23.580]  Which basically is about the only white supremacist thing in this country is left
[2:23:23.580 --> 2:23:30.460]  Right absolutely and that that is so true because right now the one thing that is keeping black people
[2:23:31.100 --> 2:23:36.060]  Down is the school system because you let's talk about that with melissa tate

[2:27:01.580 --> 2:27:08.380]  With all the gaslighting the moralization and absurdity. It's like we're living in a twilight zone and all right, Eric's in New Hampshire
[2:27:08.460 --> 2:27:14.300]  Eric, thanks for calling. Go ahead. Hey, Alex. Thanks for taking my call. If I could I just want to throw a quick plug out for the phone of the product

[2:27:17.580 --> 2:27:23.900]  You're on the fence about it. Get off the fence get the product support the info word Tyler in Maine. You're on the year
[2:27:23.980 --> 2:27:28.700]  Thanks for rolling. Go ahead. Hey, Alex. It's great to be on with you. It's an honor honor. Talk to you. Awesome
[2:27:28.780 --> 2:27:34.780]  Uh, so personally, I wanted to do is say I love the product alpha power even at 29

[2:27:38.620 --> 2:27:42.220]  So just number one for a few of you. It definitely works. It's not a joke.
[2:27:42.780 --> 2:27:44.780]  Absolutely
[2:27:44.780 --> 2:27:50.380]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[2:28:14.780 --> 2:28:16.780]  I
[2:28:30.300 --> 2:28:32.540]  You know, I'm sold on people like melissa tape
[2:28:33.900 --> 2:28:36.780]  Because they're what america's dream is all about
[2:28:36.780 --> 2:28:44.460]  About what you stand for is what you stand for. That's why everything martin lucid king said made such sense to everybody
[2:28:45.100 --> 2:28:47.580]  And we'd already fixed a lot of problems when he took us over the top
[2:28:47.900 --> 2:28:51.020]  By just saying I want our children to live together in the future not what color they are
[2:28:51.020 --> 2:28:53.900]  But what they stand for and who they are and we all know that
[2:28:54.700 --> 2:29:00.060]  You don't go buy a suit of clothes asking whether a black person or a brown person or a white person came up with it
[2:29:00.060 --> 2:29:06.220]  You asked is that a good set of clothes? You don't go eat at a restaurant at least I don't saying what color person is the chef
[2:29:06.220 --> 2:29:10.940]  You go there because it's good food. You don't listen to music asking what color is this person
[2:29:11.260 --> 2:29:17.180]  I can hear an african player hispanic asian white doesn't matter. I can hear eric clapton or jimmy hinders. It's beautiful
[2:29:18.620 --> 2:29:21.660]  And that's that's our humanity our free choice
[2:29:22.460 --> 2:29:28.380]  And people that try to set things up in the way of that and tell you in college and high school now
[2:29:28.460 --> 2:29:32.220]  Oh, it's not about what somebody does. It's about what color they are
[2:29:32.220 --> 2:29:38.460]  That's evil and it's done to divide us. So I've asked my questions and
[2:29:38.860 --> 2:29:41.580]  Melissa tate. I've been impressed with you for several years watching your work
[2:29:41.980 --> 2:29:46.460]  And uh getting a chance to read your book last week, and I really appreciate my producer getting on so quick
[2:29:46.460 --> 2:29:50.300]  I love to invite you back to co-host some time or come on for a couple hours and take calls with us
[2:29:50.300 --> 2:29:52.940]  But I've been asking a lot of questions the last few segments
[2:29:52.940 --> 2:29:54.860]  I want to give you the floor the last eight minutes
[2:29:54.860 --> 2:30:01.020]  We've got to just impart other knowledge of people as a successful beautiful person that is not black
[2:30:01.020 --> 2:30:09.500]  That's not white, but it's a human that god made and and and what you think we can do to to to transcend this globalist poison
[2:30:11.340 --> 2:30:14.860]  Well alex, I mean looking at everything that's happening right now
[2:30:15.340 --> 2:30:21.580]  Everything just seems so dire. I mean I just look at every corner and I'm like what is going on
[2:30:22.140 --> 2:30:26.300]  You know, I just saw a video uh the other day of like a tick tock
[2:30:26.300 --> 2:30:32.620]  Uh like a teenager on tick tock and she was giving all these pronouns on her thing and and she was dressed like a ram
[2:30:33.020 --> 2:30:38.140]  And she was saying my pronouns are ram rammy rummo, and I was like what is going on
[2:30:38.140 --> 2:30:43.260]  I just I just it just hit me. I was like wow this looks so bleak right now
[2:30:43.260 --> 2:30:50.860]  But let me tell you what gives me hope what gives me hope is that this country was founded on a covenant between
[2:30:52.540 --> 2:30:54.540]  God's people with god
[2:30:54.540 --> 2:31:00.780]  To create this nation this nation was founded on the principles biblical principles
[2:31:01.420 --> 2:31:07.020]  And that's what gives me hope because I feel like the lord is working in all of this chaos
[2:31:07.420 --> 2:31:12.540]  You know every other country has fallen to communism and socialism including where I've come from
[2:31:13.180 --> 2:31:18.700]  You know, but I feel like there's something unique about the united states that covenant that the lord made
[2:31:18.700 --> 2:31:26.780]  With the founders of this nation is the one thing I hold on to that god is not going to allow this country to fall to communism
[2:31:27.180 --> 2:31:30.460]  So I am seeing a great awakening that is taking place
[2:31:30.540 --> 2:31:35.180]  And there is a remnant of people that are awakening and starting to take action
[2:31:35.500 --> 2:31:41.580]  You know peacefully and starting to get involved and starting to do things that I feel like are going to do something
[2:31:41.660 --> 2:31:45.260]  And right now I mean what we're looking at it feels like a huge giant
[2:31:45.260 --> 2:31:49.740]  It feels like something that is insurmountable, but when you read the bible you see that
[2:31:50.300 --> 2:31:53.580]  You know god only needs a remnant a small group of people
[2:31:53.660 --> 2:31:57.340]  You know like the gideon army was an army of just 300 people god said
[2:31:57.340 --> 2:32:01.100]  I just made 300 people to fight this army of a million people
[2:32:01.580 --> 2:32:04.220]  And that's kind of the paradigm that we're in right now
[2:32:05.020 --> 2:32:06.060]  so
[2:32:06.060 --> 2:32:12.060]  I wouldn't worry about the the masses and all the people that are just going along with this obviously it's wrong
[2:32:12.060 --> 2:32:19.260]  But if that small group of people those of us who are awake and aware of what's happening start to get involved
[2:32:19.660 --> 2:32:23.980]  We can really turn things around with the power of god because we have to pray
[2:32:24.060 --> 2:32:27.420]  But we also have to have corresponding action in the natural
[2:32:27.740 --> 2:32:32.220]  So that's what gives that's what gives me hope and that's what i'm hoping that people out there
[2:32:32.620 --> 2:32:38.700]  Who watch your show who watch other shows other patriots will listen to what i'm saying and and start to do
[2:32:38.700 --> 2:32:44.460]  Certain things in their community local politics is huge school boards
[2:32:45.020 --> 2:32:48.460]  Even something as simple as getting your kids out of the public school system
[2:32:48.860 --> 2:32:52.540]  Is something that i really talk about and i go into it in quite detail
[2:32:53.340 --> 2:32:58.940]  In my book because i feel like that's where we're losing the war right now because we have we're fighting all these battles
[2:32:59.020 --> 2:33:05.580]  We're fighting pro-life gun control and all these things but the left left has a system right now where they have 50 million
[2:33:05.580 --> 2:33:10.300]  Of our kids in their care so you can be fighting for all these things
[2:33:10.940 --> 2:33:14.940]  During the deal you know exit like out of egypt and they still got you
[2:33:15.900 --> 2:33:18.780]  Exactly and right now they have 50 million kids
[2:33:19.180 --> 2:33:22.060]  So no matter what we're doing we're just spinning our wheels because
[2:33:22.540 --> 2:33:26.220]  Every single time they have 50 million kids that are on their conveyor belts
[2:33:26.540 --> 2:33:30.060]  And we're just kind of just picking the little issues one issue at a time
[2:33:30.380 --> 2:33:32.700]  So i feel like education is such a huge
[2:33:32.700 --> 2:33:35.980]  So strike back at the heart take control of our families again. Let me ask you this
[2:33:36.540 --> 2:33:40.140]  Because you're a really obviously energetic person. What is your energy like right now?
[2:33:40.140 --> 2:33:43.900]  I just feel god has really pissed off. I feel like more than i've ever felt
[2:33:44.380 --> 2:33:47.820]  It's hard to control right now. What are you feeling in your spirit right now?
[2:33:49.020 --> 2:33:51.340]  Well, i'm feeling very energized right now
[2:33:51.740 --> 2:33:56.460]  It's a very it's like the best of times and the worst of times, you know, you're seeing like
[2:33:56.940 --> 2:34:02.220]  Two extremes you're seeing like the the extremes on the left and all the craziness
[2:34:02.220 --> 2:34:08.140]  That's going on over there and then you're really seeing like an awakening of people on the other side
[2:34:08.700 --> 2:34:12.140]  Was standing up and fighting, you know just seeing like the mama bears, you know
[2:34:12.140 --> 2:34:15.980]  I feel like okay the mama bears are going to save the country because when you come after
[2:34:16.540 --> 2:34:21.340]  Mothers and their children and that's when you've started a real fight because as a mother
[2:34:21.580 --> 2:34:23.100]  I know how it is
[2:34:23.100 --> 2:34:27.020]  You know people love their children and they're going to fight for their children and right now
[2:34:27.020 --> 2:34:33.660]  They're really coming to attack our children when you see what they're doing like with the mask and forcing kids to wear masks
[2:34:33.820 --> 2:34:39.020]  Forced vaccines, you know isolating kids and the drag queen story times and this new thing
[2:34:39.020 --> 2:34:41.420]  I can't even say on air this horrible guy
[2:34:41.980 --> 2:34:48.860]  With like the things he did in london that they would try to have somebody do that to children these people are demonic
[2:34:49.740 --> 2:34:55.900]  It's unbelievable. I showed my husband that and he couldn't believe that I I was actually showing him yesterday
[2:34:55.900 --> 2:35:00.140]  I was like this guy, you know the the rainbow monkey guy with the dildo
[2:35:00.700 --> 2:35:02.540]  I could not believe it
[2:35:02.540 --> 2:35:07.100]  I could not I mean for those who don't know imagine a six foot guy shows up with a huge fake
[2:35:07.180 --> 2:35:14.220]  You know what with a fake rarian and breast and the women bring their kids to them like an altar that's satanism
[2:35:14.780 --> 2:35:16.700]  I mean, it's just it's great. I mean, I mean
[2:35:17.820 --> 2:35:19.820]  It's seeing what we'll put up with
[2:35:19.820 --> 2:35:26.460]  Yeah, and and that's the worst part the worst part. I mean what's worse than that story is the fact that
[2:35:26.700 --> 2:35:28.860]  Mothers were bringing their children to that
[2:35:29.420 --> 2:35:33.740]  You know, it just goes to show you just how far gone some of the people are
[2:35:34.380 --> 2:35:38.940]  But I still feel there's hope for the country. There's still hope for the world
[2:35:39.420 --> 2:35:41.980]  So I I never want to give a bleak message
[2:35:42.060 --> 2:35:48.460]  But you know again talking about getting involved getting our kids out of the public school system is huge
[2:35:48.460 --> 2:35:50.300]  You know if every
[2:35:50.300 --> 2:35:54.700]  Patriot took their kids out of the public school system, you know, we wouldn't
[2:35:55.340 --> 2:36:01.340]  The the system would collapse the public school system and that's the indoctrination factory that is taking place right now
[2:36:01.980 --> 2:36:05.100]  So we need to really rethink education
[2:36:05.980 --> 2:36:09.420]  I know it's it's kind of a paradigm shift because where I come from
[2:36:09.740 --> 2:36:13.740]  It's very normal for a middle-class family to take their kids to private school
[2:36:13.740 --> 2:36:18.620]  So my kids are in private school. That's very normal, but I've noticed that in the united states like
[2:36:19.100 --> 2:36:21.100]  public school people are very
[2:36:21.260 --> 2:36:25.260]  Emotionally invested in the public. Yeah, even people that have the money think it's like a good thing to do and it's not
[2:36:25.260 --> 2:36:30.460]  It's run by the globalist even most private schools have got problems. Well, all I can say is I've known about you for years
[2:36:30.540 --> 2:36:33.180]  I've read your book and you've had a lot of courage
[2:36:33.740 --> 2:36:37.420]  Uh, and I follow your work almost every day. I see what you're doing without even trying to follow you
[2:36:37.420 --> 2:36:39.740]  I see what you're doing. You're a you're a warrior
[2:36:39.740 --> 2:36:43.420]  Uh, and you're just awesome and you're an example what we should all do
[2:36:43.420 --> 2:36:48.540]  I don't want to praise you too much. It'll try to platform me, but but you've had a lot of courage in one minute closing comment
[2:36:50.540 --> 2:36:52.860]  Well, um, my closing comment is
[2:36:54.220 --> 2:36:56.380]  I would like people to start being
[2:36:57.020 --> 2:37:02.220]  Reiterating what I was saying we need to start being involved because right now we are facing
[2:37:03.020 --> 2:37:06.300]  Marxism, this is something that happened in my own country
[2:37:06.300 --> 2:37:12.220]  You know, we had the same type of situation with the racial division and that's why I was so able to quickly
[2:37:12.780 --> 2:37:17.980]  Pick up on it when it started happening here the same rhetoric that the democrats were having
[2:37:19.020 --> 2:37:23.660]  I started to see the same thing happen here that was happening in my country
[2:37:24.220 --> 2:37:28.380]  Preceding to the collapse and for those of you who don't know in Zimbabwe
[2:37:28.380 --> 2:37:31.180]  We had the worst economic collapse probably in history
[2:37:31.180 --> 2:37:36.540]  I think we made the Guinness Book of Records of the worst inflation and really leading up to hold on
[2:37:36.540 --> 2:37:39.420]  I got loaded phone lines, but I'm gonna host to the next hour. I'll get to everybody

[2:42:30.740 --> 2:42:35.420]  Bobway what is that trillion dollar note one trillion dollars that's beyond the German
[2:42:35.420 --> 2:42:39.220]  Weimar Republic that's where we're headed so you're just intriguing I could have you
[2:42:39.220 --> 2:42:44.700]  on for a whole show just about growing up to you or I guess you said a teenager in Zimbabwe
[2:42:44.700 --> 2:42:50.580]  spend a few minutes on that life lesson having you see how great America was not like you
[2:42:50.580 --> 2:42:55.700]  were some weak person once you got here you thrived I mean we were glad we've got you
[2:42:55.700 --> 2:43:00.780]  so I mean that's our that's our our empowerment but for people that don't know what it's like
[2:43:00.780 --> 2:43:08.200]  to live in a communist hellhole please tell them well you know growing up in Zimbabwe
[2:43:08.200 --> 2:43:13.180]  Zimbabwe was a beautiful country I mean when I grew up it was just an amazing place to
[2:43:13.180 --> 2:43:17.180]  live I wouldn't I couldn't have asked the way I haven't been there they say it looks
[2:43:17.180 --> 2:43:22.060]  like Hawaii well it actually looks a lot like South Florida because when my husband visited
[2:43:22.060 --> 2:43:27.500]  us and I visited the country he was like man this place looks like South Florida and then
[2:43:27.500 --> 2:43:31.740]  the next time we went I was like wow it really does I mean it's beautiful and when I grew
[2:43:31.740 --> 2:43:36.940]  up there you know it was it's a multiracial country very cosmopolitan I went to school
[2:43:36.940 --> 2:43:41.420]  with people from all over the world because they say that we have the best climate and
[2:43:41.420 --> 2:43:46.940]  the best weather in the world so it was great growing up there we had a very strong currency
[2:43:46.940 --> 2:43:51.680]  in fact I think at one point the Zimbabwe dollar was one is to one with the British
[2:43:51.680 --> 2:43:56.260]  pound so it was actually stronger than the US dollar so when I grew up Zimbabwe was a
[2:43:56.260 --> 2:44:01.940]  very successful country and people would migrate from other neighboring countries to come to
[2:44:01.940 --> 2:44:09.060]  Zimbabwe so you saw the whole process from a wonderland to hell yes absolutely yeah so
[2:44:09.060 --> 2:44:15.140]  people would come in from other countries for a better life in Zimbabwe and then gradually
[2:44:15.140 --> 2:44:21.700]  things started to change and then you just see like inflation hyperinflation empty shelves
[2:44:21.700 --> 2:44:26.980]  I mean my mother everything that she ever worked for you know all her life savings were gone
[2:44:26.980 --> 2:44:31.860]  I mean they were worthless you know she it came down to the point where you know her entire
[2:44:31.860 --> 2:44:36.740]  life savings could just go by her a bag of groceries and again I oversimplify it but
[2:44:36.740 --> 2:44:41.140]  I mean how did it happen I'll be obviously was the dictator but what were the other forces
[2:44:41.140 --> 2:44:50.100]  that did that well I think the main issue there was obviously the the I'm sorry the farmers
[2:44:50.100 --> 2:44:54.820]  that were you know the farming situation that was happening there production and farming
[2:44:54.820 --> 2:45:00.180]  there was a lot of conflict that happened with the commercial farmers the government just
[2:45:00.180 --> 2:45:04.420]  basically scapegoated the issues that were happening in the country and just like this
[2:45:04.420 --> 2:45:08.420]  just like the Russian Revolution they took over the farms Mao took over the farms and it
[2:45:08.420 --> 2:45:16.260]  caused a collapse right yeah so 60% of production went down when that happened with the farms
[2:45:16.260 --> 2:45:21.700]  unemployment just became rampant so it was just like a cascading effect to the point where you
[2:45:21.700 --> 2:45:28.020]  know the entire system just collapsed so it was very sad to watch but I came to the United States
[2:45:28.020 --> 2:45:33.140]  right when that stuff just started happening so the the height of the collapse was when I had
[2:45:33.140 --> 2:45:38.500]  actually come here to the United States so I watched the beginning of it so I remember being
[2:45:38.500 --> 2:45:44.420]  you know standing in bread lines I remember standing you know sleeping overnight in a fuel
[2:45:44.420 --> 2:45:50.740]  queue a fuel line you know waiting for gas the next morning so it's yeah it I've lived it so I
[2:45:50.740 --> 2:45:55.700]  understand it and that's why I felt that the Lord has called me to speak up against it because I
[2:45:55.700 --> 2:45:59.860]  feel like Americans feel like that can never happen here I could have never imagined that
[2:45:59.860 --> 2:46:05.300]  would happen in Zimbabwe because Zimbabwe was a great country very successful very peaceful I
[2:46:05.300 --> 2:46:12.420]  used to walk home from school miles nobody would bother me very peaceful place and then that happened
[2:46:12.420 --> 2:46:17.860]  so it can happen here well I totally agree and I don't want to give it a dumb down answer but I've
[2:46:17.860 --> 2:46:22.420]  read a little bit of history I didn't live through it like you even though the quote white colonialist
[2:46:22.420 --> 2:46:28.900]  the Dutch or whoever or the British weren't in control anymore once that control was gone the
[2:46:28.900 --> 2:46:36.100]  left said get rid of the system too and then basically that's what happened is that a that's
[2:46:36.100 --> 2:46:40.420]  true that's true and that's what's happening here and that's why I was able to pick up on the whole
[2:46:40.420 --> 2:46:46.580]  Black Lives Matter movement you know it's about you know finding a victim class and then pitting
[2:46:46.580 --> 2:46:53.700]  that victim class against the producers and then the the victim class will then overthrow the system
[2:46:53.700 --> 2:46:59.780]  and that's just basically how Marxism works and in every country they exploit different divisions
[2:46:59.780 --> 2:47:04.820]  so in Russia they obviously couldn't use race because everybody is white but in Zimbabwe we do
[2:47:04.820 --> 2:47:12.900]  have that we do have white and black Zimbabwe and so they exploited that racial component component
[2:47:12.900 --> 2:47:17.380]  of it and that's what they're doing here in the United States and that's why I was able to pick up
[2:47:17.380 --> 2:47:22.900]  on it and that's why I wrote the book so that I can draw parallels of what happened in Zimbabwe
[2:47:22.900 --> 2:47:26.100]  with what's happening here in the United States. That's right you do a great job of the book. All right
[2:47:26.100 --> 2:47:33.780]  join us again for an hour just on Zimbabwe just amazing thank you Melissa Tate RealMelisaTate.com
[2:47:33.780 --> 2:47:40.340]  the book is available I guess all over the place I read an online version. It's on Amazon a lot of
[2:47:40.340 --> 2:47:44.580]  people still shop on Amazon but you can get it on my website there. Oh I don't care where they get it
[2:47:44.580 --> 2:47:48.580]  they get it on Amazon as a matter of where they get it exactly a choice privilege. All right
[2:47:48.580 --> 2:47:55.700]  Melissa Tate God bless you you're amazing thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Wow she is impressive.
[2:47:55.700 --> 2:48:00.500]  All right I apologize to the callers making a hole for an hour but I had her on the phones were
[2:48:00.500 --> 2:48:04.260]  loaded I wanted to get to your calls so we're going to get to you right now but let me tell you
[2:48:04.900 --> 2:48:10.180]  amazing amazing what the glove was the U.N. on the left did like the white people aren't even
[2:48:10.180 --> 2:48:13.300]  charging more it's like well let's just blow up the free market because whites did it.
[2:48:14.500 --> 2:48:21.700]  Let's get rid of capitalism here. As a matter of what color you are you are inheriting whether
[2:48:21.700 --> 2:48:26.980]  you're white black old young whatever this system that's not perfect but my god it's a lot better
[2:48:26.980 --> 2:48:31.220]  than other ones and once the commies have blown everything up there's nothing but starvation
[2:48:31.220 --> 2:48:35.380]  to death which is what Claude Schwab wants while he's in Switzerland laughing at you.
[2:48:35.380 --> 2:48:39.860]  I'm not back from the Swiss I'm just saying that's where Claude Schwab lives. They've got their safe
[2:48:39.860 --> 2:48:45.860]  zones while they do all this to us and I live in America. I love America like folks living
[2:48:45.860 --> 2:48:49.860]  in Zimbabwe and you know she we didn't get into that but you know they killed hundreds of thousands
[2:48:49.860 --> 2:48:56.900]  or drove out hundreds of thousands of white farmers and you saw what happened once that happened
[2:48:57.460 --> 2:49:01.380]  it's just the infrastructure was gone all their contracts and all their know-how and all the
[2:49:01.380 --> 2:49:05.460]  things they did all things they knew was gone. The majority of blacks didn't want that they tried
[2:49:05.460 --> 2:49:10.420]  to fight it but the government wanted the control over the people. The government was jealous of
[2:49:10.420 --> 2:49:14.340]  independence they were like we can't have the general public here knowing how to run all this
[2:49:14.340 --> 2:49:18.020]  but you know the general public in in charge of all this infrastructure get rid of it.
[2:49:19.540 --> 2:49:25.540]  Well a couple guys in an army tank with machine guns don't know how to grow a bunch of vegetables
[2:49:25.540 --> 2:49:33.300]  and so they starve to death. All right we've got so many callers here that have been holding a
[2:49:33.300 --> 2:49:36.260]  long time. Who's been holding the longest? Who should I go to here first?
[2:49:41.700 --> 2:49:47.460]  No idea who I should go to first. Let's go to Bob in North Carolina. Bob you're on the
[2:49:47.460 --> 2:49:55.220]  here. Thanks for holding. AJ what's up long time listeners since the 90s. Just a quick shout out.
[2:49:55.220 --> 2:50:00.100]  I just uh I never call I just listened but I was compelled the other day I was like you know what
[2:50:00.100 --> 2:50:04.740]  I'm gonna send an email over to someone in the crew and I did but I didn't get a response I was
[2:50:04.740 --> 2:50:10.820]  compelled to call so let's just jump right into it. I live out here in the Carolinas. I work for
[2:50:10.820 --> 2:50:15.460]  I would say one of the top three financial institutions in the country not the world
[2:50:15.460 --> 2:50:21.380]  um and you know majority of us are working from home from the pandemic and now they're getting
[2:50:21.380 --> 2:50:26.740]  ready to bring people back into the office and I know I'm not the uh the only person probably
[2:50:26.740 --> 2:50:31.540]  listening that works from home that's getting ready to go back to the office and that's probably
[2:50:32.180 --> 2:50:38.100]  get getting ready to get segregated so and I'm sure you understand when I yeah who's vaccinated
[2:50:38.100 --> 2:50:44.180]  who is vaccinated. Exactly so what they're getting ready to do is if you're not vaccinated
[2:50:44.180 --> 2:50:50.180]  they're going to require face covering physical distancing uh uh two uh you talking about JP
[2:50:50.180 --> 2:50:56.260]  Morgan Goldman Sachs uh yeah that's all the big banks. Yeah I mean there you go I mean you I would
[2:50:56.260 --> 2:51:02.020]  rather think about the cult level of this you didn't take a poison shot they admit doesn't even

[2:53:48.340 --> 2:53:53.700]  discovering the globalist the elites the manipulation the CFR the trilateral commission
[2:53:53.700 --> 2:54:00.660]  the Bilderberg group the bohemian grove the club of Rome and so even though it seems like the
[2:54:00.660 --> 2:54:06.900]  globalists are winning the truth is they've had to come out the open to attack human freedom
[2:54:06.900 --> 2:54:13.700]  because they're actually losing we have forced them out in the open so as bad as these times are
[2:54:13.700 --> 2:54:18.740]  a lot of negative things are about to happen realize humanity is winning you've got to trust in the
[2:54:18.740 --> 2:54:25.860]  plan of god and trust in the plan of god's justice that is invincible that is ethereal
[2:54:25.860 --> 2:54:31.620]  timeless and unstoppable so don't trust in man trust in god to lead god and direct your soul
[2:54:31.620 --> 2:54:36.020]  and then take action against the globalists and realize you've got my commitment from alex jones
[2:54:36.020 --> 2:54:44.900]  and my crew to you we will never back down from the globalist and we will never surrender you're
[2:54:44.900 --> 2:55:12.020]  listening to the alex jones show ladies and gentlemen on a rigor scale of one to ten it's a
[2:55:12.020 --> 2:55:17.860]  ten to say we're spying on all your text messages the democrats are that's the nsa was
[2:55:17.860 --> 2:55:22.980]  though they'd all be arrested if they admitted to it um oh tucker carlson the nsa is not spying
[2:55:22.980 --> 2:55:27.380]  in with the democrats the democrats just want access everybody's text messages to spy on them
[2:55:27.380 --> 2:55:33.780]  they're already doing it i told you that don't come out already and so yeah uh morgan stanley
[2:55:34.340 --> 2:55:40.020]  all the big ones they're the bankers they're the burning made-offs they're like yeah you're
[2:55:40.020 --> 2:55:44.260]  going to wear a mask and jump through all these hoops and do all oh by the way there's a booster
[2:55:44.260 --> 2:55:47.780]  shot you got to take because the thing we gave you doesn't protect you oh but we don't have any
[2:55:47.780 --> 2:55:53.940]  liability for what it does to you so the big corporations know that they're global governance
[2:55:53.940 --> 2:55:58.980]  they set the precedent everybody else copies it uh and so it's so sad to hear what mom's talking
[2:55:58.980 --> 2:56:04.340]  about mom finish your story but but the the ironic thing of all this and you know this i mean because
[2:56:04.340 --> 2:56:09.060]  you're amazingly smart and super duper intelligent so you know most of these bankers they're they're
[2:56:09.060 --> 2:56:13.940]  underwriters right so before they give out money they do massive massive research with you know
[2:56:13.940 --> 2:56:17.860]  whether it's going to be a business loan or you know for a home loan they do massive
[2:56:17.860 --> 2:56:23.780]  massive research before they take risk but in this case are they doing the research you know are
[2:56:23.780 --> 2:56:28.260]  are they do they really care no i mean i don't know a day you tell me i think all they care about
[2:56:28.260 --> 2:56:33.700]  is liability they want to show the government hey well it's non liability they they want eugenics
[2:56:33.700 --> 2:56:39.540]  and they're set i thought they'd set the precedent with a harmless vaccine and then set the precedent
[2:56:39.540 --> 2:56:44.740]  to make us take deadly ones no they're giving us stuff it's really bad right up front and and
[2:56:44.740 --> 2:56:49.780]  i just want to add like because you made me laugh yesterday with the guy ooey gooey whatever he
[2:56:49.780 --> 2:56:55.060]  i forgot what he said but that dude he's insane you know aj you've been nailing it you told us
[2:56:55.060 --> 2:56:59.860]  about the cable boxes i mean there's no difference is what they're doing with the cable boxes is what
[2:56:59.860 --> 2:57:04.420]  they're doing with the uh with the cell phones and let me just throw a fun note joe boot needs to
[2:57:04.420 --> 2:57:09.460]  calm down the last time he ran his mouth he got ran up on by one of the wu-tang clan members
[2:57:09.460 --> 2:57:14.260]  and got smacked up and they have video footage of it and then he shut up so he needs to sit down
[2:57:14.260 --> 2:57:18.900]  trying to disrespect the king of the king of intelligence and the king of free information
[2:57:18.900 --> 2:57:24.020]  which is you and we all know that he knows that as well but i didn't i didn't mean to go on the
[2:57:24.020 --> 2:57:28.580]  side but i just wanted to just tell you this is because it's not right because you know when
[2:57:28.580 --> 2:57:32.900]  people go back to work that aren't vaccinated we're going to go to designated work areas right
[2:57:32.900 --> 2:57:37.220]  and we're and not all these people are trump supporters and right and we all know that's
[2:57:37.220 --> 2:57:41.140]  one of the things that we didn't like about oh they're already getting us ready in the documents
[2:57:41.140 --> 2:57:45.940]  to be put in isolation camps that's all they're doing god bless you love you brother you're the
[2:57:45.940 --> 2:57:50.900]  king of info and i appreciate you as for that joe booton guy or booton or areas i just heard him
[2:57:51.620 --> 2:57:56.100]  try to say i was in the kkk which i do not agree with i'm not i'm not the democratic party
[2:57:56.100 --> 2:57:59.940]  and i wanted to debate him because he's got a big show but he pussed out and said he'll never
[2:57:59.940 --> 2:58:05.300]  debate me okay fine he started the fight whatever he's a pussy excuse my french uh let's go to
[2:58:05.300 --> 2:58:14.180]  who's up next guy's in order first timer and leziana thanks for holding so long i really

[2:58:25.060 --> 2:58:29.700]  out that would be so easy so convenient i agree and it's something to do with the shopping car people
[2:58:29.700 --> 2:58:35.620]  have asked for that a lot though there should be a donations option yes that's perfect now let's get
[2:58:35.620 --> 2:58:42.020]  right to it um you you're you know i heard you this morning man you came out fiery and i think the
[2:58:42.020 --> 2:58:46.500]  reason why you feel like that is you're giving us all of this information and make no mistake
[2:58:46.500 --> 2:58:52.980]  we're taking this information we're listening to it we believe it we see it as you say you're telling
[2:58:52.980 --> 2:59:00.500]  us the house is on fire all around us okay now i i smell the smoke i feel the flames i see the
[2:59:00.500 --> 2:59:06.260]  flames now alex tell me how to get out of the house that's the one thing that you i mean listen
[2:59:06.260 --> 2:59:10.820]  here's the deal i don't want to get put in prison but the same time and i don't want the offensive
[2:59:10.820 --> 2:59:16.020]  violence because that could go wrong no we gotta arrest bill gates and fouchy i mean i mean we
[2:59:16.020 --> 2:59:19.780]  don't control tell what don't don't hang up this is the most important question asked
[2:59:19.780 --> 2:59:23.220]  no last month all the calls are great don't hang up first timer and i get to everybody else over
[2:59:23.220 --> 2:59:26.580]  this that no one's gonna take over the rest of fourth hour out of the most in the war room
[2:59:26.580 --> 2:59:29.780]  today three to six p.m and i got a bunch of meetings i had to go to but these calls are important
[2:59:30.900 --> 2:59:38.660]  i'm not a general i'm not trying to plan a war we're under attack by bill gates of these eugenicists
[2:59:38.660 --> 2:59:44.740]  so you ask what do we do they're the ones killing everybody i call for a just serious discussion
[2:59:44.740 --> 2:59:53.940]  about what we do about them the globalists are having their revolution but free humanity has
[2:59:53.940 --> 3:00:02.820]  to have its revolution we have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers trying to enslave the
[3:00:02.820 --> 3:00:09.860]  entire biological processes of humans and turn us into these artificial corporate controlled
[3:00:09.860 --> 3:00:17.060]  slaves worse than slaves so just just property from cradle to grave of the system
[3:00:18.100 --> 3:00:24.660]  rendered down to be servile minions of the system and a ritual of dominance and satanic
[3:00:24.660 --> 3:00:30.420]  control we have to recognize the great reset post-industrial world which realizes a nightmare
[3:00:30.420 --> 3:00:34.900]  dystopia and we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia
[3:00:34.900 --> 3:00:40.900]  it's that choice it's that realization that's going to change the world and it's the only
[3:00:40.900 --> 3:00:46.580]  choice we've got freedom or slavery go to reval it is a spiritual battle and info wars at the tip
[3:00:46.580 --> 3:00:57.540]  of the spear fighting it waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the
[3:00:57.540 --> 3:01:07.140]  front lines of the info war all right so we really should open the show tomorrow and take
[3:01:07.140 --> 3:01:14.180]  calls for four hours on what do we do about the un and big media with an unapproved vaccine
[3:01:14.180 --> 3:01:18.740]  that's dangerous killing people trying to force us to take it and say we're terrorists and we
[3:01:18.740 --> 3:01:24.180]  don't take it in fact we're going to air next segment or the segment after that then no one
[3:01:24.180 --> 3:01:29.220]  will do a little prelude segment for his show an oan piece they did this morning with roiders
[3:01:29.220 --> 3:01:32.900]  saying they're making it up that anybody's dying for the vaccine and they show all the documentation
[3:01:33.540 --> 3:01:37.220]  i mean who would sign on to kill all these people who would sign on to suppress
[3:01:37.220 --> 3:01:42.500]  treatments for covet 19 that's a very real thing but overblown if you have the the treatments
[3:01:43.220 --> 3:01:48.020]  a bunch of evil people that are killing us through different means you know we all know
[3:01:48.020 --> 3:01:53.620]  a gun's illegal way to kill somebody a sword's illegal way a hammer a baseball bat you go to
[3:01:53.620 --> 3:02:00.580]  prison for that but if you do it through a vaccine well then you're a hero no this is a new way to
[3:02:00.580 --> 3:02:07.140]  attack us a new war so i'll ask you the question first timer in Louisiana what do we do about what
[3:02:07.140 --> 3:02:14.500]  they're doing because i'm asking that question i'm asking you real quick you said as you were
[3:02:14.500 --> 3:02:19.700]  going out you're not a general i'm sorry you are you are in that seat you've delivered all of this
[3:02:19.700 --> 3:02:26.180]  information to us and in a way we feel helpless with all of this information we see nothing
[3:02:26.180 --> 3:02:33.060]  happening we only see the new order new world order gaining ground on us and further submitting us
[3:02:33.700 --> 3:02:39.140]  in a stranglehold you are a general you are our coach you okay well well here's the deal
[3:02:41.300 --> 3:02:44.980]  if violence was carried out against bill gates the deep state right now that would make them
[3:02:44.980 --> 3:02:50.820]  martyrs and their whole agenda would continue on we have to discredit the un the wto big pharma
[3:02:50.820 --> 3:02:58.340]  and stop their programs so how do we do that no violence no violence but we need to stand our
[3:02:58.340 --> 3:03:04.100]  ground we need okay i call for millions of people to surround feiser in new york i call for millions
[3:03:04.100 --> 3:03:08.580]  of people to protest the white house peacefully i mean i'll go join you i call for whatever i mean
[3:03:08.580 --> 3:03:15.380]  they this is illegal nuremberg violation beyond tuskegee evil and we can't sit here and take it
[3:03:15.380 --> 3:03:20.820]  i appreciate your call first timer i mean that's where i am i all i'm saying is
[3:03:24.260 --> 3:03:28.100]  if bill gates was sitting right next to me in a stupid pink sweater right now i would have trouble
[3:03:28.820 --> 3:03:34.500]  not trying to strangling but i'm not going to do that and turn him into a victim you understand
[3:03:34.500 --> 3:03:42.900]  i want to politically destroy him i want to stop what he's doing but i i mean i it takes enough
[3:03:42.900 --> 3:03:47.700]  time to figure all this out much less what are we going to do about it i just asked the average
[3:03:47.700 --> 3:03:54.900]  person that's a school teacher or a cop or fire department or a or a personal works in retail
[3:03:54.900 --> 3:04:01.140]  or a lawyer a whoever you are i mean this is real folks they're giving us experimental shots
[3:04:01.140 --> 3:04:05.940]  that are designed to kill people it's come out and the very people doing it say they want to kill
[3:04:05.940 --> 3:04:12.420]  everybody and i'm just sitting here like in a nightmare in a damn nightmare and i don't know
[3:04:12.420 --> 3:04:16.420]  what to do that's why we're here on air to have a discussion about it but uh
[3:04:19.380 --> 3:04:23.300]  you know i've tried my best i mean i you know we got a million people in dc to protest the election
[3:04:23.300 --> 3:04:27.700]  fraud and they just hijacked it and had provocateurs breaking the capital and blame us so that's
[3:04:27.700 --> 3:04:31.620]  what i mean like you can get we've got power to put troops on the field
[3:04:34.100 --> 3:04:37.860]  but then what happens once we start that fight that's the thing about the globalists they've
[3:04:37.860 --> 3:04:42.180]  started a big fight where they think they were going is not happening they're getting hurt right
[3:04:42.180 --> 3:04:47.780]  now they're getting exposed they're getting discredited but that doesn't make me smile and click
[3:04:47.780 --> 3:04:52.980]  my heels and just feel like we've done some great job i don't want to fight with bill gates i don't
[3:04:52.980 --> 3:05:00.740]  want to fight with the pentagon but they started a fight with us you're like well let's fight with
[3:05:00.740 --> 3:05:04.500]  them what the average military person isn't part of that they're compartmentalized they're some of
[3:05:04.500 --> 3:05:09.300]  the best people we've got i mean as bad as the fbi is the average fbi agent's not a bad person
[3:05:09.300 --> 3:05:14.740]  they're not our enemy so i mean it's just like it's spiritual folks we have spiritual evil
[3:05:14.740 --> 3:05:20.660]  in charge on top and only god's gonna fix this we just have to trust god do the right thing speak
[3:05:20.660 --> 3:05:27.060]  up and then god will fix it and i'm not i'm not punting on that it's it's like i've learned man i
[3:05:27.060 --> 3:05:33.940]  know all this stuff forwards and backwards i don't know what orders to give and anybody pretending
[3:05:33.940 --> 3:05:39.380]  they do is a liar these globalists claus schwaab and all them telling the big old bankers oh we
[3:05:39.380 --> 3:05:44.820]  got a plan to take over they just set them up for destruction i mean i could tell you this
[3:05:44.820 --> 3:05:49.620]  isn't gonna work in the end i could tell you they're screwed the question is how long does it go
[3:05:49.620 --> 3:05:55.460]  how many people die how bad's it gonna get it's easy to look at what they did and tell you they
[3:05:55.460 --> 3:06:02.900]  screwed the pooch but does that mean i'm ready to pull the trigger on something i'm no sir
[3:06:04.100 --> 3:06:09.380]  because i've seen i can have the most good intentions and man that gets taken away from me
[3:06:09.380 --> 3:06:21.540]  just like that i knew the folks started cube inspired by us and what we did exposing the
[3:06:21.540 --> 3:06:26.740]  pedophile rings and all the rest of it and they saw me sued over it and they saw us attacked over
[3:06:26.740 --> 3:06:30.100]  it and they said well we'll just do it anonymously and that got taken away from them in a month
[3:06:32.420 --> 3:06:35.540]  i got tipped off by some of our own people like you didn't know you're right under the nose of that
[3:06:35.540 --> 3:06:43.780]  it turned out that was true so man i've learned i'm just a man and it takes enough of my energy to
[3:06:43.780 --> 3:06:50.660]  figure out how the cow ate the cabbage i sure as hell don't know how to run some war against the new
[3:06:50.660 --> 3:06:58.180]  world order because it's not it's it's it's it's it's a person by person issue it's good versus
[3:06:58.180 --> 3:07:05.620]  evil and we are an immoral demonic people on average and so we're cursed and if we all changed
[3:07:05.620 --> 3:07:10.980]  our hearts and got right with god it would fix itself and that's that that does that mean we
[3:07:10.980 --> 3:07:14.820]  let them inject us with deadly poison does that mean we let them burn our cities down does that
[3:07:14.820 --> 3:07:21.300]  mean we go along with no no i'm just saying you got to give those orders yourself and your own
[3:07:21.300 --> 3:07:28.580]  personal life i'm not some cult leader up here telling you like the like the i mean i mean i've
[3:07:28.580 --> 3:07:36.100]  got right here this video we didn't play of uh biden claims capital insurrectionist worse than
[3:07:36.100 --> 3:07:44.900]  civil war confederates civil war killed a million people he says that was worse four dead people
[3:07:44.900 --> 3:07:53.540]  it's an assault on reality william in california go ahead you're on the air
[3:07:55.060 --> 3:08:01.860]  hi elis can you hear me i can brother hi elis thanks for taking my call i've been listening
[3:08:01.860 --> 3:08:07.540]  here i've been listening to uh your guest melissa um and first of all i just want to tell everybody
[3:08:07.540 --> 3:08:15.540]  i want to tell all of your listeners be at peace let's be calm and let's be focused we're going
[3:08:15.540 --> 3:08:21.220]  up against something and we know we're going up against something now as your last caller said
[3:08:21.220 --> 3:08:27.140]  we're feeling the flames and we want to know where to go we need to be focused i i've had this dream
[3:08:28.020 --> 3:08:35.700]  and it probably comes from my grandmother but i'm i'm in the higgins boat and i can feel a
[3:08:35.700 --> 3:08:45.220]  sea on my face and i know what i'm about to do and encounter is going to be a great challenge
[3:08:45.860 --> 3:08:53.860]  and um i just want to say to everybody fear not because god has delivered our enemy into our hands
[3:08:54.740 --> 3:09:00.580]  we may not know these things but they are delivered what they've done is they bit the tiger in the bus
[3:09:00.580 --> 3:09:05.700]  by attacking our children and as your last as your guest said and she triggered something
[3:09:06.260 --> 3:09:12.900]  when she said something about getting between a bear and its cub there's something
[3:09:13.620 --> 3:09:20.260]  instinctual that will occur and i know i've seen it happen i've worked with a park service and uh
[3:09:20.260 --> 3:09:28.260]  i can only say um our enemy has been delivered and it's a matter of time but we're we're about
[3:09:28.260 --> 3:09:36.420]  to hit the beach and we're going to have to feel the flames and we're going to encounter
[3:09:37.780 --> 3:09:44.260]  some things that we were maybe not encountering in our minds prepared and prepared wise um
[3:09:45.540 --> 3:09:50.980]  god bless y'all god bless you alex for what you do well god bless you brother so what do you
[3:09:50.980 --> 3:09:55.620]  think the timetable is i mean biden's preparing martial law and nationwide lockdowns and i'm not
[3:09:55.620 --> 3:10:01.620]  i'm not going to put up with it all right old shroyer's coming up and i swore to go to your
[3:10:01.620 --> 3:10:09.620]  calls i'm going to jam in barbara luke gaol and jerry in the sixth segment then we're going to air
[3:10:09.620 --> 3:10:14.100]  an oen report and then it'll come at the end of it it was so powerful ahead of the war room today
[3:10:15.140 --> 3:10:19.060]  and so definitely look for that but i gotta tell the crew i had a big meeting everybody's waiting
[3:10:19.060 --> 3:10:28.340]  for me um to be at this meeting but uh let me let them know almost off almost off because i
[3:10:28.340 --> 3:10:31.460]  would really spend half my time trying to fund this operation that's what i'm dealing with there
[3:10:31.460 --> 3:10:37.540]  so i should probably plug uh we have the new sales going right now the x2 in the spray bottle and
[3:10:37.540 --> 3:10:41.940]  in the dripper bottle is 60 and 40 off that's going to sell off and i'm still selling it
[3:10:41.940 --> 3:10:51.140]  out at that price and we have the new green fiber that said it's so good 50 off
[3:10:51.140 --> 3:10:56.740]  jacob in ohio welcome go ahead hey how's it going alex good great last caller i just wanted to
[3:10:56.740 --> 3:11:01.700]  start with plugging your sleep supplement uh it's basically the only way i get to sleep anymore
[3:11:01.700 --> 3:11:06.500]  uh with all the gaslighting moralization and absurdity it's like we're living in the twilight zone
[3:11:06.500 --> 3:11:10.980]  and all right eric's in new hamster eric thanks for calling go ahead hey alex thanks for taking
[3:11:10.980 --> 3:11:15.220]  my call if i could i just want to throw a quick plug out for the one of the product um the x2

[3:11:24.580 --> 3:11:29.940]  alex it's great to be on with you it's an honor honor talk to you awesome uh so first thing i wanted
[3:11:29.940 --> 3:11:36.500]  to do was say i love the product alpha power even at 29 if you ask my better half she loves it
[3:11:36.500 --> 3:11:41.540]  uh and it helps in the bedroom so just number one for a few it definitely works it's not a joke
[3:11:42.420 --> 3:11:43.220]  absolutely
[3:11:47.860 --> 3:11:52.580]  i never had a marketing plan for info wars i went out and found the best products i could find from
[3:11:52.580 --> 3:11:57.540]  the research to funder operation i wanted you to get products that empowered you that you loved
[3:11:57.540 --> 3:12:01.860]  so you'd want to come back and buy more i treat you like i want to be treated it's very very simple
[3:12:01.860 --> 3:12:06.260]  it's instinctive it's spiritual it's what i do and that said our iodine products
[3:12:06.260 --> 3:12:11.300]  have become our best sellers and x2 right now is discounted because listeners and viewers are
[3:12:11.300 --> 3:12:17.060]  habituated to only buy it when it's on sale and so i'm going to catch 22 when i don't have it on
[3:12:17.060 --> 3:12:21.940]  sale i don't sell it but we're selling out of all other products because of supply chain breakdowns
[3:12:21.940 --> 3:12:26.100]  and so i'm going to catch 22 i need to sell products at full price but i can't i got to
[3:12:26.100 --> 3:12:31.940]  sell them at discount and so it's discounted 40 off for the dropper bottle 60 off for the spray
[3:12:31.940 --> 3:12:37.300]  bottle even though it's about to sell out it won't be available for months so get it x2 is
[3:12:37.300 --> 3:12:42.660]  selling out at info wars store dot com for 40 and 60 off with double patreon points and free
[3:12:42.660 --> 3:12:47.300]  shipping because why that's when you buy it we need your funds or it'll be off air it's an amazing
[3:12:47.300 --> 3:13:03.220]  product you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:13:17.300 --> 3:13:22.980]  all right let's jam in three phone calls right now from luke gale and jerry and then we got a

[3:13:40.740 --> 3:13:46.100]  don't give up we really need you i wasn't trying to throw fits earlier in sam to give up i'm not it's
[3:13:46.100 --> 3:13:51.060]  the opposite i'm not going to give up i may get a battle axe actually it's it's like you want to
[3:13:51.060 --> 3:13:56.260]  kind of feel like it almost feels evil to keep talking about this you see what i'm saying yeah
[3:13:56.260 --> 3:14:00.900]  i'll join you but anyhow uh it was nice to hear from melissa and it brought back some memories
[3:14:00.900 --> 3:14:08.180]  when i was preaching my parents took us on a tour down to south america and we were caught in the
[3:14:08.180 --> 3:14:12.740]  revolution that they had going on there and we were locked into our hotel rooms we couldn't leave
[3:14:12.740 --> 3:14:17.860]  the hotel uh they had soldiers walking up and down on the sidewalks that we could see from the
[3:14:17.860 --> 3:14:23.460]  window with their rifles and it took a long time for the u.s consulate to finally get the okay for
[3:14:23.460 --> 3:14:28.260]  us to leave the country and i wish other people in this country had a chance to go and see some of
[3:14:28.260 --> 3:14:32.100]  those things in other countries and they would appreciate what we really have here they would
[3:14:32.100 --> 3:14:39.060]  recognize we were put under artificial u.n. martial law to get ready yeah and another thing i wanted
[3:14:39.060 --> 3:14:45.380]  to mention was why can't the patriots form their own police department i have a thing here i would
[3:14:45.380 --> 3:14:51.620]  like to read real quick the police are a constituted body of persons empowered by a state with the aim
[3:14:51.620 --> 3:14:56.980]  to enforce the law to ensure the safety health and possessions of citizens and to prevent crime and
[3:14:56.980 --> 3:15:02.740]  civil disorder their lawful powers include arrest and the use of force littered legitimized by the
[3:15:02.740 --> 3:15:08.260]  state via the monopoly on violence the term is mostly commonly associated with the police forces
[3:15:08.260 --> 3:15:13.780]  of a sovereign state that are authorized to exercise the police power of that state within
[3:15:13.780 --> 3:15:20.820]  a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility police forces are often defined as being separate
[3:15:20.820 --> 3:15:25.060]  from the military and other organizations involved in the defense of the state
[3:15:25.060 --> 3:15:28.820]  against foreign aggression let me roll this down you're talking about federalism
[3:15:28.820 --> 3:15:32.100]  and you have the federal government the state government local government state law
[3:15:32.660 --> 3:15:37.700]  you can create a city with people incorporate and hire own police force absolutely so the
[3:15:37.700 --> 3:15:41.940]  democrats it's a political move to get rid of the police or actually get rid of them and
[3:15:41.940 --> 3:15:47.700]  remake them so you're right we can reconstitute the police as part of our will anytime we wish
[3:15:47.700 --> 3:15:53.300]  under the militia power why can't the patriots get together and we can all form our our police
[3:15:53.300 --> 3:15:57.780]  force and go after and arrest all these criminals in washington that's what the democrats are
[3:15:57.780 --> 3:16:02.980]  taking over all the cities and making them sorrows run to try to arrest alex jones and donald trump
[3:16:02.980 --> 3:16:06.900]  but so what you're saying is right we should be running our cities and arresting them not the
[3:16:06.900 --> 3:16:14.020]  other way around beautiful solution gale thank you so much all right luke in washington go ahead
[3:16:14.020 --> 3:16:20.020]  you're on the air thank you for taking my call alex sir just want to say the ruler of this world
[3:16:20.020 --> 3:16:24.980]  has already been judged by jesus christ and his victory on the cross eventually the separation
[3:16:24.980 --> 3:16:30.100]  of the week from the tears will happen but we all grow together until the harvest and that means
[3:16:30.100 --> 3:16:36.500]  even members of our own family may resonate with the world and not jesus christ and the power of
[3:16:36.500 --> 3:16:43.060]  belief as you believe so it shall be the power of the mind so i want to highlight the idea of
[3:16:43.060 --> 3:16:49.380]  unselfish wishes and the power like selfish wishes backfire like all of the laden's wishes in the
[3:16:49.380 --> 3:16:56.900]  movie eladin no i agree none of my selfish wishes ever came true all of my unselfish wishes came
[3:16:56.900 --> 3:17:04.500]  true precisely eladin frees the genie at the end with his last wish um when homer and the simpsons
[3:17:04.500 --> 3:17:10.420]  uses all of his wish selfish wishes they backfire but then flanders the christian uses the monkey
[3:17:10.420 --> 3:17:16.580]  paw and it gets rid of the aliens and then also in the simpsons flanders has a bomb shelter
[3:17:16.580 --> 3:17:21.460]  they all kick him out of it and then they realize it's wrong they go out and join him to face the
[3:17:21.460 --> 3:17:27.620]  doom and the meteor ends up hitting the shelter that they were all would have been in and so
[3:17:27.620 --> 3:17:34.500]  so uh that's the concept of what we could be facing right what we run away from we find
[3:17:34.500 --> 3:17:41.220]  by running away from tyranny we let it take over you got it in star wars empire strikes back
[3:17:41.220 --> 3:17:47.060]  luke says i don't believe it and yoda says that is why you fail and when neo starts to face the
[3:17:47.060 --> 3:17:52.900]  agents in the matrix they ask what is he doing he's beginning to believe is what morpheus says
[3:17:52.900 --> 3:18:00.900]  and braveheart i want to believe as he does says robert debruce and so uh we got to keep
[3:18:00.900 --> 3:18:06.820]  shining the light on the darkness and be a light but not become the darkness and so what you're
[3:18:06.820 --> 3:18:12.900]  doing is is what we need to be doing and then uh i could keep going i don't know in the meantime
[3:18:12.900 --> 3:18:19.620]  the enemy's modus operandi appears to be mirroring mirroring copying and inverting and i my conjecture
[3:18:19.620 --> 3:18:24.420]  is they have inverted the holy trinity into what psychology describes as the dark triad
[3:18:24.420 --> 3:18:32.100]  psychopathy narcissism machiavellianism and aka their secret religion witchcraft satanism luciferianism
[3:18:32.820 --> 3:18:39.220]  and uh so body snatching can be spiritual psychological technological or maybe even
[3:18:39.220 --> 3:18:45.700]  biological it amounts to the same thing appearing human but but are not human husk they are pretenders
[3:18:45.700 --> 3:18:52.500]  actors with traits of the dark triad which include mimicking our behavior and uh they could it might
[3:18:52.500 --> 3:18:57.620]  not be an extraterrestrial alien but it might be a terrestrial alien with illuminati whistleblower
[3:18:57.620 --> 3:19:02.740]  donald marshall describes as the human drone parricided by uh all right hey guys get luke's

[3:23:19.140 --> 3:23:27.220]  we are right now this is matthew 24 verse 9 then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall
[3:23:27.220 --> 3:23:34.340]  kill you and you shall be hated of all nations for my name sake and then shall many be offended and
[3:23:34.340 --> 3:23:39.540]  shall betray one another and shall hate one another that's right where we're at brother and that's
[3:23:39.540 --> 3:23:44.020]  because god's name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say and that's why

[3:26:07.300 --> 3:26:14.260]  live from the info wars dot com studios you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:26:14.260 --> 3:26:25.140]  and now your host owin shroyer the mainstream media is under reporting the side effects of
[3:26:25.140 --> 3:26:30.260]  covid vaccines some of which are potentially life-threatening one america's pierce and sharp
[3:26:30.260 --> 3:26:35.700]  has worn the numbers behind those stories and the media's efforts to discredit negative news about
[3:26:35.700 --> 3:26:42.180]  the vaccines from the very start of the pandemic one america news has reported on the news the
[3:26:42.180 --> 3:26:47.860]  mainstream corporate media won't touch such as the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine to treat the
[3:26:47.860 --> 3:26:53.380]  chinese virus owin was viciously attacked for those reports which have since been proven by
[3:26:53.380 --> 3:27:00.820]  the scientific community to be 100 accurate now one america news is once again under fire for
[3:27:00.820 --> 3:27:06.340]  breaking the mainstream narrative and reporting on the troubling side effects caused by the various
[3:27:06.340 --> 3:27:12.420]  coronavirus vaccines these include severe flu like symptoms diarrhea vomiting dehydration
[3:27:12.420 --> 3:27:19.860]  bells palsy anaphylaxis and shock deadly heart inflammation and even death cases of gian beret
[3:27:19.860 --> 3:27:25.460]  syndrome after receiving the johnson and johnson vaccine are also on the rise with the cdc now
[3:27:25.460 --> 3:27:31.860]  investigating the potentially paralyzing side effect but these clear demonstrable cases of
[3:27:31.860 --> 3:27:37.460]  injuries caused by the vaccines aren't getting any attention in the media and agencies like
[3:27:37.460 --> 3:27:44.500]  Reuters are even questioning oan's reporting on the subject so to dispel any questions and provide
[3:27:44.500 --> 3:27:50.580]  some background for our reports let me break down where our information comes from so that at least
[3:27:50.580 --> 3:27:56.900]  one news agency can provide some transparency on the vaccine first of all it has been claimed that
[3:27:56.900 --> 3:28:02.660]  using the veirs website to report deaths and injuries from the vaccine is unreliable since
[3:28:02.660 --> 3:28:09.300]  these reports are unconfirmed that's only partially correct the veirs website is a government
[3:28:09.300 --> 3:28:13.940]  platform that collects and shares information about adverse side effects from any and all
[3:28:13.940 --> 3:28:19.860]  vaccines and although these events are not confirmed patients must sign a legal statement
[3:28:19.860 --> 3:28:25.380]  swearing to their accuracy before submitting the report additionally many of these reports come
[3:28:25.380 --> 3:28:32.260]  straight from health care providers who are required by law to submit reports of injuries
[3:28:32.260 --> 3:28:38.980]  and deaths to the veirs website on top of that vaccine manufacturers are also required by law to
[3:28:38.980 --> 3:28:46.100]  report all adverse side effects to veirs reports like this from the associated press make it sound
[3:28:46.100 --> 3:28:51.460]  like it's just right-wing conspiracy theorists submitting these reports to veirs when in reality
[3:28:51.460 --> 3:28:57.140]  it's actually a very serious process that's relied on by hospitals vaccine manufacturers
[3:28:57.140 --> 3:29:03.860]  and even the government to help decide which vaccines are safe and which aren't one american news
[3:29:03.860 --> 3:29:09.220]  has also reported on the higher than average number of miscarriages being reported after
[3:29:09.220 --> 3:29:14.020]  pregnant mothers received the vaccine reports which are dismissed by the mainstream media
[3:29:14.580 --> 3:29:19.700]  yet even the new england journal of medicine reported troublingly high numbers of miscarriages
[3:29:19.700 --> 3:29:25.620]  following vaccination according to a report published by the journal in june almost 14 percent
[3:29:25.620 --> 3:29:31.460]  of pregnant women who were given the coronavirus vaccine then suffered a miscarriage and lost their
[3:29:31.460 --> 3:29:39.140]  baby that's backed up by data from veirs again which as of july 13th shows 985 miscarriages
[3:29:39.140 --> 3:29:44.580]  following the vaccine doctors speaking to one american news confirmed these reports saying
[3:29:44.580 --> 3:29:49.780]  that pregnant women experienced numerous side effects including myalgia chills fever and lymph
[3:29:49.780 --> 3:29:55.060]  adenopathy a swelling of the lymph nodes that showed up during abnormal mammograms and is a
[3:29:55.060 --> 3:30:01.140]  warning sign for lymphoma next on the list of fact-checked reports involves the claim that there
[3:30:01.140 --> 3:30:07.220]  are more adverse side effects from the coronavirus vaccines than all other vaccines combined take
[3:30:07.220 --> 3:30:14.900]  a listen to our report from march 15th of this year in the the various report 1500 deaths related
[3:30:14.900 --> 3:30:23.300]  to the covid vaccine that's more adverse offense than any vaccines all of them grouped together
[3:30:23.940 --> 3:30:32.180]  so if you were to take all the vaccines in the world that we use mmr polio okay hib rsb all of
[3:30:32.180 --> 3:30:38.260]  these vaccines very cell of acts holidays and you combine all of those vaccine adverse events is
[3:30:38.260 --> 3:30:45.940]  still less than what we're seeing with the covid vaccines so that tells me they there's still some
[3:30:45.940 --> 3:30:52.180]  work to do we also use data compiled from the veirs website itself from august 1st 2007 to
[3:30:52.180 --> 3:30:59.060]  november 30th 2020 a time period covering more than 13 years the total number of all reported
[3:30:59.060 --> 3:31:08.660]  vaccine deaths was 3001 from december 1st of 2020 through july 13th of 2021 an eight month period
[3:31:09.380 --> 3:31:16.980]  the total number of all covid vaccine deaths is now over 9 000 and this data falls in line with
[3:31:16.980 --> 3:31:23.700]  data from the fda and the cdc as well that data states that from january 1st 1996 to march 31st
[3:31:23.700 --> 3:31:29.940]  of 2021 the adverse events from the use of various medications like the flu vaccines tylenol hydroxy
[3:31:29.940 --> 3:31:40.180]  chloroquine ivermectin dexamethasone and remdesivir total 253 794 meanwhile from the same time period
[3:31:40.180 --> 3:31:51.700]  the adverse events from all covid vaccines totals 384 270 including 4800 deaths and this is all data
[3:31:51.700 --> 3:31:58.180]  collected from the food and drug administration and the centers for disease control lastly we'd
[3:31:58.180 --> 3:32:04.100]  like to point out that these efforts to fact check one america news may not be as open and
[3:32:04.100 --> 3:32:09.220]  transparent as they claim to be the news agency reuters reached out to us and sent us a list of
[3:32:09.220 --> 3:32:14.980]  facts they refuted in some of our reporting on the coronavirus vaccines but while reuters is
[3:32:14.980 --> 3:32:20.180]  trying to shut down reports that point out how dangerous vaccines from companies like phaser
[3:32:20.180 --> 3:32:29.060]  are what they don't mention is that the ceo of reuters up until february of 2020 is now a member
[3:32:29.060 --> 3:32:36.020]  on the board of phaser which sort of adds up to have reuters working hard to suppress any
[3:32:36.020 --> 3:32:42.660]  information about phaser's vaccine injuring or killing people not to mention that for its vaccine
[3:32:42.660 --> 3:32:48.260]  phaser received four billion dollars from the federal government and the company says it expects
[3:32:48.260 --> 3:32:57.220]  to make another 26 billion dollars by selling the vaccine just this year is it any wonder that
[3:32:57.220 --> 3:33:03.140]  companies like phaser with direct ties to the mainstream media are exerting all the influence
[3:33:03.140 --> 3:33:09.620]  they can to make their vaccines look as good as possible regardless the consequences to our health
[3:33:10.580 --> 3:33:17.140]  again for the record one america news is not promoting an anti-vaxxer position on this or
[3:33:17.140 --> 3:33:24.100]  any other vaccine for that matter vaccines have a proven track record of saving lives and curing
[3:33:24.100 --> 3:33:31.380]  diseases for over a century but the cases we've mentioned here are real as many doctors around
[3:33:31.380 --> 3:33:36.980]  the world have pointed out it is reckless and dangerous to promote such a drug without at
[3:33:36.980 --> 3:33:48.740]  least trying to find answers to these very real questions for one america news i'm pierce and sharp
[3:33:50.660 --> 3:33:56.500]  all right ladies and gentlemen we are back now in the info wars world headquarters in austin

[3:40:28.500 --> 3:40:36.980]  just get into the information on the war room coming up here in 13 minutes but you know you've
[3:40:36.980 --> 3:40:45.220]  got now heraldo revera coming out and he says that he wants mandated vaccines
[3:40:47.940 --> 3:40:53.700]  and so you use that as an example of the mainstream news approach to things is heraldo
[3:40:53.700 --> 3:41:00.420]  revera just a tyrant who likes medical tyranny or does heraldo revera know where the bread is
[3:41:00.420 --> 3:41:07.140]  buttered at fox news and he says i might as well suck up to big pharma i might as well
[3:41:07.140 --> 3:41:11.300]  shill for the vaccines i might as well go with mandatory vaccines because hell i want to be
[3:41:11.300 --> 3:41:16.420]  on the air next year when they force it and i want to say see i was for medical tyranny i'm a good
[3:41:16.420 --> 3:41:26.980]  mainstream news i'm a i'm a good mainstream news man so as if the awakening by conservatives
[3:41:26.980 --> 3:41:33.860]  trump supporters and american patriots to heraldo revera hasn't been uh enough of a phenomenon over
[3:41:33.860 --> 3:41:38.020]  the last six or so months with his staff with dan banjino and all the other stuff that's been going
[3:41:38.020 --> 3:41:47.620]  on uh this will be the cake and it's so great to see oan who's on cable news filing reports like that
[3:41:47.620 --> 3:41:57.860]  that quite frankly are more palatable and easy a little easier to swallow than the info wars
[3:41:57.860 --> 3:42:03.940]  approach to things info wars is like the super red pill like a horse pill it's like you know
[3:42:03.940 --> 3:42:07.940]  it's kind of tough to swallow some people don't want to swallow it didn't but but oan like they
[3:42:07.940 --> 3:42:12.900]  deliver it nice and it's fashionable and it looks like it's very professional and it's all scripted
[3:42:12.900 --> 3:42:17.540]  and they have their stuff and so that's an easier thing to swallow that's that's more palatable thank god
[3:42:17.540 --> 3:42:25.460]  that's on tv thank god there's a news organization out there that mainstream republicans will say
[3:42:25.460 --> 3:42:30.820]  is a good source telling the truth about these vaccines meanwhile in france where they announced
[3:42:30.820 --> 3:42:35.860]  macron the other day announced oh we're gonna have mandatory vaccines you have massive uprisings
[3:42:35.860 --> 3:42:42.020]  happening and it reminds me actually of the yellow jacket protests that we saw some years ago
[3:42:42.020 --> 3:42:46.180]  by the way dan lineman from info wars europe is going to be joining me on the war room at four
[3:42:46.180 --> 3:42:51.460]  o'clock central so the second hour uh certainly we'll be talking about that and and as the group
[3:42:51.460 --> 3:42:56.020]  shows all this footage here be going over all this footage as well so that's big news
[3:42:57.780 --> 3:43:07.940]  but i gotta say we are finally getting some truly hard core information out of the georgia audit
[3:43:07.940 --> 3:43:15.060]  we've had we've been told what they've found in the arizona audit we've been told but they haven't
[3:43:15.060 --> 3:43:23.940]  shown us they haven't they haven't shown it to us we are now seeing what the audit in folken county
[3:43:23.940 --> 3:43:33.860]  georgia has revealed yesterday they released a video that proves unequivocally that they were
[3:43:33.860 --> 3:43:38.820]  double scanning maybe triple scanning who knows they just they're just going over these scans
[3:43:38.820 --> 3:43:44.820]  now from folken county of the ballots and it's true as the eyewitness testimony sworn affidavit
[3:43:44.820 --> 3:43:50.980]  said they were double triple quadruple quadruple counting ballots in georgia in Atlanta specifically
[3:43:50.980 --> 3:43:58.500]  now the crew rolls this video let me explain this the democrats took a gamble that was a pretty
[3:43:58.500 --> 3:44:05.780]  easy one to know you're gonna win and they said we believe that in Atlanta joe biden is going to
[3:44:05.780 --> 3:44:11.620]  get more votes than trump and of course it was with mark zuckerberg where they were running
[3:44:11.620 --> 3:44:18.180]  their voter initiative drives just to make sure so so and that was illegal by the way that zuckerberg
[3:44:18.180 --> 3:44:24.340]  did so zuckerberg with the democrats working with the democrats spent hundreds of millions of dollars
[3:44:24.340 --> 3:44:32.180]  going into democrat running their cities to find the places that to kind of do a probe a little
[3:44:32.180 --> 3:44:41.140]  recon mission to find the places that would be the the best bet to double triple scan ballots
[3:44:41.140 --> 3:44:45.940]  because you can double triple scan ballots but unless you know that your candidate is going to
[3:44:45.940 --> 3:44:51.300]  be favored in those districts well then it doesn't do you any good if you think trump is going to
[3:44:51.300 --> 3:44:56.020]  have more votes in that district and biden the double scanning ballots doesn't do any good so
[3:44:56.020 --> 3:45:02.580]  they sent zuckerberg out like a like a like a scout like a sports scout before a draft to
[3:45:02.580 --> 3:45:07.380]  find the best cities which they already had a good idea that's why zuckerberg went to atlanta and
[3:45:07.380 --> 3:45:11.060]  detroit and philadelphia and all these other places they already knew where the democrats
[3:45:11.060 --> 3:45:15.540]  strongholds were where they could get away with election theft but they had to know they had to
[3:45:15.540 --> 3:45:22.260]  be positive folks that this what they had to steal this election and there's a new element of this
[3:45:22.260 --> 3:45:28.020]  with the vaccines too but but we'll focus on why they had to get biden in but but let's focus on
[3:45:28.020 --> 3:45:34.820]  this right now so they released the video of their of their scans they released the video not here
[3:45:34.820 --> 3:45:41.460]  say showing you the audit results that they were double counting triple counting quadruple counting
[3:45:41.460 --> 3:45:48.980]  ballots in atlanta because they knew joe biden would have more votes in that district than trump
[3:45:48.980 --> 3:45:54.020]  based on the research they did with mark zuckerberg the entire calendar year they did the same thing
[3:45:54.020 --> 3:46:00.020]  in philadelphia detroit milwaukee you can you can bet on it arizona you can bet on it they did
[3:46:00.020 --> 3:46:05.380]  everything they could to steal this election they had to they had to have their candidate in there
[3:46:05.380 --> 3:46:12.420]  to advance the new world order to the next phase donald trump is not part of this folks i have
[3:46:12.420 --> 3:46:16.980]  people all the time saying trump's a part of it he fooled you trump's not perfect trump's made a lot
[3:46:16.980 --> 3:46:20.900]  of mistakes sometimes i'm gonna be a cheerleader for trump sometimes i'm gonna boo and hiss and
[3:46:20.900 --> 3:46:27.940]  say he sucks but he's not out to get us he's made mistakes he's not perfect he was surrounded
[3:46:27.940 --> 3:46:37.700]  so what do we have today oh the crew has already pulled it up so today and this is the big one
[3:46:37.700 --> 3:46:45.220]  ladies and gentlemen this is the whopper this is the moby dick this is the hole in shallota
[3:46:47.940 --> 3:46:53.380]  in georgia the democrats figured if they were double scanning or triple scanning whatever
[3:46:53.380 --> 3:46:59.300]  they needed to do in atlanta they figured that that would be enough to beat donald trump it wasn't
[3:47:00.180 --> 3:47:07.540]  it wasn't so they had a backup plan and and my guess is i think it's a fair guess based on the
[3:47:07.540 --> 3:47:11.780]  results because just like in just like in georgia where the graph went straight up for biden you
[3:47:11.780 --> 3:47:20.100]  saw the same thing in pennsylvania in wisconsin uh in michigan so they ran that operation everywhere
[3:47:20.100 --> 3:47:25.700]  it's just not confirmed yet but now we have it confirmed in georgia so they figured we'll have
[3:47:25.700 --> 3:47:30.900]  enough votes if we're double scanning the ballots these these these packets of ballots and we know
[3:47:30.900 --> 3:47:35.380]  in atlanta that biden's gonna get more votes than trump so we'll just we'll just try to amplify that
[3:47:35.380 --> 3:47:40.740]  margin by double triple quadruple quadruple scanning that was proven yesterday but here's the thing
[3:47:40.740 --> 3:47:45.060]  they had a backup plan because again like i told you they could not lose this election they could
[3:47:45.060 --> 3:47:53.140]  not so what was the backup plan if that didn't work they had cases of ballots and and we we saw
[3:47:53.140 --> 3:48:00.740]  the video of this cases of ballots ready to go in the circumstance that double scanning the ballots
[3:48:00.740 --> 3:48:05.540]  in the city of atlanta in folton county wouldn't be enough to overcome trump's margin of victory
[3:48:06.580 --> 3:48:14.740]  so they had all these backup illegal fake ballots in crates in folton county ready to go
[3:48:14.740 --> 3:48:22.180]  and at the end of the night when trump was ahead they went with plan b so they shut down the polling
[3:48:22.180 --> 3:48:28.100]  locations and they and they made up a water main break as the excuse then the corrupt democrat
[3:48:28.100 --> 3:48:33.220]  criminals came in that have been id'd they all democrat operatives they came in when the pool
[3:48:33.220 --> 3:48:38.660]  when the polling place was supposed to be closed they came in this is all on video on the security
[3:48:38.660 --> 3:48:45.780]  tape they pulled out the cases of of fake illegal ballots they pulled them out and they started
[3:48:45.780 --> 3:48:52.340]  counting them now these were quote unquote absentee ballots and remember we had sworn affidavit i
[3:48:52.340 --> 3:48:57.860]  witnessed testimony saying these could not have been legitimate ballots there was no crease they
[3:48:57.860 --> 3:49:01.780]  came from the same address they were they had the same penmanship on all of them so they already knew
[3:49:01.780 --> 3:49:07.700]  they were illegal but now we know the plan so they audited those votes and guess what they discovered
[3:49:07.700 --> 3:49:16.020]  well how would you possibly have in an election on a on a on a vote graph over over time with time
[3:49:16.020 --> 3:49:21.780]  and votes on a line graph how would you possibly have a line that goes straight up well you'd have
[3:49:21.780 --> 3:49:28.820]  to have thousands of ballots that you counted and they all had a vote for biden on them well
[3:49:28.820 --> 3:49:35.060]  guess what ladies and gentlemen we now have the audit and we now have the numbers when they ran
[3:49:35.060 --> 3:49:40.980]  their campaign their fake news to close the to close the polling place and those absentee ballots
[3:49:40.980 --> 3:49:46.340]  that they counted after it was all said and done we now have the numbers they were 100 percent for
[3:49:46.340 --> 3:49:56.660]  joe biden every single absentee ballot in the packets was every single vote 100 percent for
[3:49:56.660 --> 3:50:06.020]  joe biden every single one every single one now again we've been telling you this for months
[3:50:06.020 --> 3:50:09.620]  because we have a brain we can put two and two together we have common sense we have logic
[3:50:09.620 --> 3:50:14.980]  and reasoning and we know how corrupt our elections are but it's pretty obvious when a line graph
[3:50:14.980 --> 3:50:21.460]  goes straight up that means that everything came in for that one thing we now have the ballots
[3:50:21.460 --> 3:50:26.820]  we now caught the democrats red-handed in fulton county they cheated they stole this election
[3:50:26.820 --> 3:50:31.060]  donald trump won georgia and they know it and now they're they're really panicked about what's
[3:50:31.060 --> 3:50:54.980]  going on in pennsylvania i'm gonna cover it coming up on the war room
