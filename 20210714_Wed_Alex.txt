[00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.521]  InfoWars.
[00:00:16.521 --> 00:00:18.062]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:00:27.219 --> 00:00:36.123]  As far as the public was concerned, the Nazis may have lost the war, but their ideology has continued to spread ever since.
[00:00:36.123 --> 00:00:49.769]  Following World War II came the United Nations, mass fluoridation of the water supply, the dumbing down of the education system, post-modernism, political correctness, and the war on drugs.
[00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:52.391]  For many, this has gone unnoticed.
[00:00:52.391 --> 00:00:55.312]  The Nazis became the pop culture model of fascism.
[00:00:56.033 --> 00:01:00.615]  Black leather and jack boots became the symbols of authoritarianism.
[00:01:00.615 --> 00:01:06.237]  Fascism could now hide itself behind a smile in a suit and a tie.
[00:01:06.237 --> 00:01:13.560]  The majority had no idea of the global fascist state being slowly installed behind the scenes.
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.260]  And now it's here.
[00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:18.114]  COVID was just the beginning of their endgame.
[00:01:18.114 --> 00:01:26.676]  The same private corporations and NGOs that planned and executed the COVID hoax are now preparing the next phase.
[00:01:26.676 --> 00:01:29.816]  We can soon expect a massive cyber attack.
[00:01:29.816 --> 00:01:44.300]  We all know, but still pay insufficient attention to the frightening scenario of a comprehensive cyber attack, which would bring to a complete halt
[00:01:45.379 --> 00:01:53.142]  To see power supply, transportation, hospital services, our society as a whole.
[00:01:53.142 --> 00:02:02.705]  The COVID-19 crisis would be seen in this respect as a small disturbance in comparison.
[00:02:02.705 --> 00:02:12.069]  The World Economic Forum, who sponsored tabletop simulations for COVID just weeks before the outbreak, are now doing the same for cyberattacks.
[00:02:13.237 --> 00:02:18.381]  Which will be the reset button needed for their great reset.
[00:02:18.381 --> 00:02:26.787]  And when the grid goes down, it will take banking and shipping down with it, killing millions in the overcrowded cities.
[00:02:26.787 --> 00:02:40.397]  Those with a survival instinct will leave the cities, which is why the Rural Domestic Preparedness Consortium, a part of Homeland Security and FEMA, is currently training for the isolation and quarantine of rural communities.
[00:02:41.904 --> 00:02:47.766]  After their Great Reset, we know how they plan to build back better.
[00:02:47.766 --> 00:03:04.073]  Two key agents of the Great Reset, Regina Dugan and Ken Gabriel, both worked for DARPA, Greenlit RNA Vaccine Research in 2012, and then went on to Google and Facebook, where they set up DARPA Equivalents.
[00:03:04.073 --> 00:03:09.635]  In 2018, they joined Welcome Leap, founded by the world's richest medical research foundation.
[00:03:10.982 --> 00:03:24.948]  Their stated goal, to be completed no later than 2030, is to have 80% of all children under the age of 3 monitored 24-7 with wearable devices that will read their brain patterns.
[00:03:24.948 --> 00:03:30.811]  Specifically, focusing on keeping the individual motivated to work.
[00:03:30.811 --> 00:03:40.295]  They plan to have an in-silico model of a child's brain to be used as the model brain that all infants will be molded to via therapeutic interventions.
[00:03:41.841 --> 00:03:45.063]  Like slaves in a dystopian sci-fi movie.
[00:03:45.063 --> 00:03:46.884]  Except this is not a movie.
[00:03:46.884 --> 00:03:49.965]  And it's no longer a conspiracy theory.
[00:03:49.965 --> 00:03:51.946]  It's all happening.
[00:03:51.946 --> 00:03:54.748]  The entire world is under attack.
[00:03:54.748 --> 00:03:57.389]  With seemingly no pushback.
[00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:01.171]  And if we don't push back, then it's all over.
[00:04:01.171 --> 00:04:04.713]  And we have nobody to blame but ourselves.
[00:04:04.713 --> 00:04:06.634]  For InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[00:04:16.741 --> 00:04:20.705]  All right, that report just went live five minutes ago at Band-Odd Video.
[00:04:20.705 --> 00:04:22.527]  I suggest you share it if you want to live.
[00:04:22.527 --> 00:04:24.389]  I mean, I'm not joking.
[00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:26.351]  This is the end.
[00:04:26.351 --> 00:04:28.113]  Band-Odd Video.
[00:04:28.113 --> 00:04:30.515]  Can't share that URL most places.
[00:04:30.515 --> 00:04:35.901]  So what you want to do is you want to share it from FreeWorldNews.tv.
[00:04:35.901 --> 00:04:37.162]  Again, that's FreeWorldNews.tv.
[00:04:40.183 --> 00:04:41.364]  It's all coming together.
[00:04:41.364 --> 00:04:42.745]  It's all been announced.
[00:04:42.745 --> 00:04:49.431]  And the CDC just came out in public documents and said they're preparing forced quarantine centers this fall.
[00:04:49.431 --> 00:04:52.554]  Joe Biden, the dictator, will declare martial law.
[00:04:52.554 --> 00:04:53.094]  Stay with us.
[00:04:53.094 --> 00:04:53.515]  We'll be back.
[00:04:59.012 --> 00:05:05.358]  Iodine is one of the most important drivers of the body for fertility, for cellular function, for libido, for life.
[00:05:05.358 --> 00:05:08.941]  If you don't have iodine, you die in a matter of months.
[00:05:08.941 --> 00:05:10.782]  So if you don't have oxygen, you die in four minutes.
[00:05:10.782 --> 00:05:12.844]  If you don't have water, you die in a week or so.
[00:05:12.844 --> 00:05:14.486]  If you don't have food, a month or so.
[00:05:14.906 --> 00:05:15.927]  What's in that food?
[00:05:15.927 --> 00:05:16.547]  Iodine.
[00:05:16.547 --> 00:05:21.111]  But if your food doesn't have that atomic pure iodine, it can't operate.
[00:05:21.111 --> 00:05:23.073]  And the food itself is lacking.
[00:05:23.073 --> 00:05:26.475]  That's why most people on Earth are deficient in iodine.
[00:05:26.475 --> 00:05:30.959]  And governments are lowering the allowance you're supposed to need to have because they want control.
[00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:33.061]  Ladies and gentlemen, our information's powerful.
[00:05:33.061 --> 00:05:34.562]  Our products are just as powerful.
[00:05:34.562 --> 00:05:36.483]  Experience clean iodine today.
[00:05:36.483 --> 00:05:37.184]  It's discounted.
[00:05:37.184 --> 00:05:40.727]  40% off of the dropper bottle, 60% off of the spray bottle.

[00:05:46.231 --> 00:05:47.532]  Don't wait any longer.
[00:05:47.532 --> 00:05:50.353]  Just like our information is powerful, our products are just as powerful.
[00:05:50.353 --> 00:05:52.155]  They don't want you to experience this.

[00:06:13.214 --> 00:06:39.521]  The only way to stop this globalist takeover is to recognize that it's taking place and that the supposed guardians of international and national security are controlled by very ruthless global corporations that are staging crises to consolidate power and control and to bankrupt the West and to starve to death the third world.
[00:06:39.521 --> 00:06:41.102]  Out of that accelerated crisis
[00:06:42.253 --> 00:06:48.719]  The social engineers will then build their new world order.
[00:06:48.719 --> 00:06:52.622]  There's the headline on InfoWars.com, today's live show feed.
[00:06:52.622 --> 00:07:01.590]  Biden preparing to declare martial law during second lockdown as CDC readies COVID isolation camps across the U.S.
[00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:04.072]  We'll show you all those documents here in a moment.
[00:07:05.686 --> 00:07:08.828]  Of course, that's all now been admitted, but we'll show you the specifics.
[00:07:08.828 --> 00:07:09.389]  Think about it.
[00:07:09.389 --> 00:07:12.251]  They knew they were going to get rid of Trump using mail-in ballots and fraud.
[00:07:12.251 --> 00:07:12.871]  They said that.
[00:07:12.871 --> 00:07:16.494]  They said it looked like he wins that night, Red Mirage.
[00:07:16.494 --> 00:07:18.835]  We'll have the mail-in ballots one way or another.
[00:07:18.835 --> 00:07:21.497]  Biden will win.
[00:07:21.497 --> 00:07:34.146]  And so that way, Trump already presided over martial law light and the lockdowns and the stay-at-home orders, which are home arrest, house arrest, which is hardcore martial law, actually, in that case.
[00:07:35.498 --> 00:07:37.240]  But that was just the icebreaker.
[00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:42.605]  Then they get their puppet into position.
[00:07:42.605 --> 00:07:48.732]  Then they start hyping up deaths that are happening from pneumonia and the flu as the fall comes.
[00:07:48.732 --> 00:07:53.657]  They inject people with virus-making machines that even U.S.
[00:07:53.657 --> 00:07:58.862]  Day-to-Day, Reuters, the New York Times, NPR admit
[00:07:59.665 --> 00:08:06.868]  And the Nobel Prize winner in virology say we'll create real deadly variants.
[00:08:06.868 --> 00:08:12.930]  See, humans are so powerful, even the most deadly viruses mutate quickly and we become immune to them.
[00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:16.412]  Most mutations make things less strong.
[00:08:16.412 --> 00:08:17.752]  But not the case of COVID.
[00:08:17.752 --> 00:08:20.714]  It's very, very real.
[00:08:20.714 --> 00:08:26.356]  The first phase, as I told you a year and a half ago, is a weak variant, but it's synthetic and they own it.
[00:08:27.259 --> 00:08:39.026]  Then once it incubates in the body, it starts shedding viruses that have a deadly spike protein in them, and then you start seeing accelerated illnesses.
[00:08:39.026 --> 00:08:42.208]  We're already seeing, per capita, more deaths this year than last year.
[00:08:42.208 --> 00:08:47.371]  We're already seeing most of the people that are dying of supposed COVID have been inoculated.
[00:08:47.371 --> 00:08:50.233]  This is in the federal reports.
[00:08:50.233 --> 00:08:51.013]  This is confirmed.
[00:08:51.013 --> 00:08:53.555]  This is medical doctors and nurses filing these.
[00:08:55.386 --> 00:08:58.667]  10,000 reports in pairs of death.
[00:08:58.667 --> 00:09:00.527]  More than all the deaths ever previously reported.
[00:09:00.527 --> 00:09:04.868]  They think maybe 1 out of 40 on average is the actual scientific study.
[00:09:04.868 --> 00:09:06.848]  They say maybe it's 1 out of 10 report, 1 out of 100.
[00:09:06.848 --> 00:09:09.589]  About 1 out of 40 report.
[00:09:09.589 --> 00:09:12.190]  So it's 40 times that.
[00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:15.010]  And it's all starting to come out.
[00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:17.871]  It's just such a horrible scenario.
[00:09:17.871 --> 00:09:20.291]  But they need a smoke screen to cut the economy off.
[00:09:20.291 --> 00:09:23.372]  They need a smoke screen to then offer you a universal income.
[00:09:24.839 --> 00:09:36.844]  As the life jacket, as the lifeboat, they throw you into the water, then they say, oh, here's a little life jacket for you, we're your savior, but we've got a rope connected to it now.
[00:09:36.844 --> 00:09:41.626]  You're not the boat with us, you're out there in the water, and you have to do what we say, or we'll cut the rope.
[00:09:43.453 --> 00:09:44.855]  We are being held hostage.
[00:09:44.855 --> 00:09:48.139]  This is all an extremely diabolical evil plan.
[00:09:48.139 --> 00:09:56.991]  It's even in the Rockefeller Foundation report 2011, Operation Lockstep, where they describe every damn bit of it in great detail.
[00:09:56.991 --> 00:09:59.194]  And that's what's so frustrating and nauseating to me.
[00:10:00.305 --> 00:10:16.610]  Is that I know what this is, I know where it leads, and I know that if we just woke up to it, and our governors and legislatures woke up, and we indicted Gates, and indicted Klaus Schwab, and indicted Fauci, they should all be SWAT teamed a year ago.
[00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:25.573]  And roll up this criminal network, it's game over, but they're in the positions of doctors and scientists and academics, and so, it's a new type of war,
[00:10:26.682 --> 00:10:41.692]  Using viruses and using fear directed by the corporate world government via the UN with the media lockstep, censoring real data and real information so they can carry this out.
[00:10:41.692 --> 00:10:53.580]  So ladies and gentlemen, I'm just completely horrified by what's going on and I can't even get my own family that knows I'm smart and knows this is real to come to grips with it.
[00:10:56.619 --> 00:10:59.300]  I tell family about stuff and they're like, okay, great.
[00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:01.581]  Hey, we ought to go on a trip.
[00:11:01.581 --> 00:11:05.963]  We ought to go camping or something.
[00:11:05.963 --> 00:11:09.685]  Or hey, are you coming to our wedding anniversary?
[00:11:09.685 --> 00:11:15.688]  Which is all fine and dandy, but that's rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic.
[00:11:17.438 --> 00:11:20.279]  Every minute we're still on air is incredibly precious.
[00:11:20.279 --> 00:11:26.701]  This is a damn New World Order scientific takeover, 21st century, 5th generational warfare.
[00:11:26.701 --> 00:11:28.201]  In the New World Order's own damn words!
[00:11:28.201 --> 00:11:32.642]  Schwab says we're waging war against the overbloom of humans, like he's some Superman.
[00:11:32.642 --> 00:11:34.303]  Ubermensch.
[00:11:34.303 --> 00:11:42.485]  They say they're going to have carbon lockdowns, and they're going to destroy the infrastructure where you're not even able to get fuel.
[00:11:42.485 --> 00:11:45.346]  They're creating a total two-tiered society.
[00:11:45.346 --> 00:11:46.626]  A breakaway civilization.
[00:11:48.869 --> 00:11:54.611]  And I'm staying on the boat trying to save people, trying to warn folks it's going down, and most of them don't even understand it.
[00:11:54.611 --> 00:12:01.633]  So, I can't even get my own family to get out of their trance and say, maybe we should get in a lifeboat.
[00:12:01.633 --> 00:12:02.874]  What is a lifeboat?
[00:12:02.874 --> 00:12:11.757]  I can't even have a discussion with my own family about where we're going to be in six months, a year, two years.
[00:12:11.757 --> 00:12:13.937]  They're not pulling back from this thing, okay?
[00:12:13.937 --> 00:12:14.537]  And I get it.
[00:12:14.537 --> 00:12:15.878]  Everybody has normalcy bias.
[00:12:16.542 --> 00:12:30.825]  And so you think, oh well, they only shut it down for a year, and yeah, things were closed for a while, and we were not essential, and we did this nonsensical six feet apart, and yeah, a lot of folks are getting sick from these shots, but let's just muddle through it, and things will get back to normal.
[00:12:30.825 --> 00:12:35.966]  They're never getting back to normal in the words of all the top globalists.
[00:12:35.966 --> 00:12:43.127]  It is a permanent takeover.
[00:12:43.127 --> 00:12:43.887]  This is the end.
[00:12:44.634 --> 00:12:47.336]  If people don't get serious, this crew is amazing.
[00:12:47.336 --> 00:12:50.399]  They're here, they see everything I see, so they know I'm not being apocalyptic.
[00:12:50.399 --> 00:12:53.661]  I'm trying to figure out how we stop this by admitting we're in an emergency.
[00:12:53.661 --> 00:12:59.246]  The house is on fire, better put it out quick or it'll consume everything.
[00:12:59.246 --> 00:13:07.152]  Rob Doo gets it, Gregg Reese gets it.
[00:13:07.152 --> 00:13:11.976]  The real people that are awake understand that we're on a stinking ship, ladies and gentlemen, with no lifeboats.
[00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:17.514]  And what's going to happen when the general public figures out what's going down?
[00:13:17.514 --> 00:13:23.179]  They're going to trigger a race war and say everything collapsed because of rioting.
[00:13:23.179 --> 00:13:23.879]  How do I know that?
[00:13:23.879 --> 00:13:27.102]  It's in the IMF World Bank plans.
[00:13:27.102 --> 00:13:30.946]  From 2001, leaked to Greg Powles back when the BBC still had some soul.
[00:13:32.206 --> 00:13:50.415]  100 plus pages leaked where the IMF and World Bank had imploded the third world and how they would then cut off the food and water, have a political riot, usually make it between two racial or religious groups as the cover for why the country then is totally collapsed so the IMF and World Bank can come up and buy it for pennies on the dollar.
[00:13:50.415 --> 00:13:55.478]  And in that, the IMF and World Bank said, we want to do this to the first world next.
[00:13:55.478 --> 00:13:58.019]  We're going to do it to Greece as a test.
[00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:00.720]  And what was it?
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:03.081]  Six, seven years later, they did it to Greece.
[00:14:03.081 --> 00:14:08.343]  Then they said, we're going to do it to the Middle East.
[00:14:08.343 --> 00:14:11.624]  Then they did it to Africa.
[00:14:11.624 --> 00:14:13.024]  Then they did it to Latin America.
[00:14:13.024 --> 00:14:16.105]  And now they're doing it to us.
[00:14:16.105 --> 00:14:18.746]  Because we take it.
[00:14:18.746 --> 00:14:21.327]  And so you look at what's going on right now in South Africa.
[00:14:22.423 --> 00:14:36.711]  You know, the trigger is a president being in trouble, a former president, but no, it's the resources cut off for over a year, it's the starvation, it's the people giving up on any hope, and everything then collapses, and that's coming here, it's coming everywhere.
[00:14:36.711 --> 00:14:39.653]  Hell, we already saw it last summer.
[00:14:39.653 --> 00:14:43.875]  So I'm not being alarmist, the house is already on fire.
[00:14:43.875 --> 00:14:47.157]  I'm not saying put a tourniquet on the leg, the damn leg's cut off.
[00:14:50.911 --> 00:14:56.795]  I'm not saying put a tourniquet on a leg, because it's gonna get cut off.
[00:14:56.795 --> 00:14:59.116]  And I'm a tough guy, okay?
[00:14:59.116 --> 00:15:00.537]  I can take a lot.
[00:15:00.537 --> 00:15:04.039]  But let me tell you, I'm pretty shook up right now!
[00:15:04.039 --> 00:15:06.701]  Because I'd hoped this was just a beta test, and no!
[00:15:06.701 --> 00:15:07.762]  They've gone all out!
[00:15:07.762 --> 00:15:09.082]  This is the Blitzkrieg!
[00:15:09.082 --> 00:15:10.383]  This is the Lightning War!
[00:15:10.383 --> 00:15:11.444]  This is the attack!
[00:15:11.444 --> 00:15:13.045]  This is time to get right with Jesus!
[00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:22.013]  And let me tell you, when there ain't food for a month, your neighbors will eat your ass, like I told you a year ago.
[00:15:22.013 --> 00:15:24.874]  And I told you that's where this was all leading and we didn't stop it.
[00:15:24.874 --> 00:15:29.096]  And there's not much time left.
[00:15:29.096 --> 00:15:43.521]  Fauci, and Gates, and Schwab, you can start with somebody like Cuomo giving orders to kill all those people, they start getting arrested, their whole plan comes out in the open, or it's over.
[00:15:43.521 --> 00:15:45.002]  We don't have much time.
[00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:47.321]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:15:47.321 --> 00:15:48.141]  We're gonna lay it all out.
[00:15:48.141 --> 00:15:50.563]  They're getting their damn FEMA camps ready for us.
[00:15:50.563 --> 00:15:52.724]  They're gonna use COVID as the cover.
[00:15:52.724 --> 00:15:53.304]  Stay with us.
[00:15:53.304 --> 00:16:00.308]  We'll be right back.
[00:16:00.308 --> 00:16:02.369]  Your voice counts.
[00:16:02.369 --> 00:16:07.431]  When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes the world.
[00:16:07.431 --> 00:16:10.033]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[00:16:10.033 --> 00:16:10.773]  They know you're angry.
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:16.907]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.

[00:17:00.026 --> 00:17:03.412]  What are champions made of?
[00:17:03.412 --> 00:17:04.554]  Here's a man who can show you.
[00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:12.652]  AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline!
[00:17:12.652 --> 00:17:14.573]  AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline!
[00:17:14.573 --> 00:17:15.894]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline!
[00:17:15.894 --> 00:17:17.236]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline!
[00:17:17.236 --> 00:17:18.337]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline!
[00:17:18.337 --> 00:17:19.938]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline!
[00:17:19.938 --> 00:17:21.239]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store...
[00:17:37.333 --> 00:17:40.775]  InfoWarsTore.com is simply the best.
[00:17:40.775 --> 00:17:43.696]  InfoWarsTore.com beats out all the rest.
[00:17:43.696 --> 00:17:44.977]  888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139 is the InfoWarsTore upline.
[00:17:44.977 --> 00:17:45.077]  888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[00:17:58.279 --> 00:18:01.643]  X2 has been our number one bestseller over the years.
[00:18:01.643 --> 00:18:04.446]  Deep Earth Crystal Iodine, the good halogen.
[00:18:04.446 --> 00:18:07.308]  It is essential for all actions in the body.
[00:18:07.308 --> 00:18:08.770]  You must have it to live.
[00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:12.534]  The UN estimates 2 billion plus people have cognitive disabilities because they don't have enough iodine.
[00:18:12.914 --> 00:18:19.342]  We have X2 in two different bottles, same amount in each bottle, but one has a spray top, one has a dropper top.
[00:18:19.342 --> 00:18:25.929]  60% off on the spray top, 40% off on the dropper top, for a limited time because they're both selling out.
[00:18:25.929 --> 00:18:28.272]  I want to thank all of the supporters that have gotten these over the years.
[00:18:28.272 --> 00:18:30.855]  They're amazing, so that's a great deal for you to stock up on it.
[00:18:31.395 --> 00:18:36.838]  But this deal is really for folks that have been on the fence and haven't experienced the good halogen for yourself.
[00:18:36.838 --> 00:18:44.342]  So, X2 in the dropper bottle and the spray bottle, 60 and 40% off for a limited time because it's selling out right now at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:18:44.342 --> 00:18:46.684]  But we're going to keep this sale going until it sells out.
[00:18:46.684 --> 00:18:48.325]  It'll probably take about two weeks.
[00:18:48.325 --> 00:18:49.445]  Don't procrastinate.
[00:18:49.445 --> 00:18:54.308]  Take advantage of this special right now at InfoWareStore.com and check out the new products we just got in as well.
[00:19:01.107 --> 00:19:03.749]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:19:35.462 --> 00:19:37.023]  You won't hear me.
[00:19:37.023 --> 00:19:37.784]  But you'll feel me.
[00:19:37.784 --> 00:19:39.846]  Without warning, something's coming.
[00:19:39.846 --> 00:19:40.246]  It's coming.
[00:19:40.246 --> 00:19:40.646]  It's coming.
[00:19:40.646 --> 00:19:41.046]  It's coming.
[00:19:41.046 --> 00:19:41.427]  It's coming.
[00:19:41.427 --> 00:19:41.747]  It's coming.
[00:19:41.747 --> 00:19:42.127]  It's coming.
[00:19:42.127 --> 00:19:42.528]  It's coming.
[00:19:42.528 --> 00:19:42.908]  It's coming.
[00:19:42.908 --> 00:19:43.328]  It's coming.
[00:19:43.328 --> 00:19:43.989]  It's coming.
[00:19:43.989 --> 00:19:44.289]  It's coming.
[00:19:44.289 --> 00:19:44.829]  It's coming.
[00:19:44.829 --> 00:19:45.290]  It's coming.
[00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:45.690]  It's coming.
[00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:46.190]  It's coming.
[00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:46.491]  It's coming.
[00:19:46.491 --> 00:19:46.991]  It's coming.
[00:19:46.991 --> 00:19:47.271]  It's coming.
[00:19:47.271 --> 00:19:48.092]  It's coming.
[00:19:48.092 --> 00:19:48.572]  It's coming.
[00:19:48.572 --> 00:19:48.932]  It's coming.
[00:19:48.932 --> 00:19:49.453]  It's coming.
[00:19:49.453 --> 00:19:49.873]  It's coming.
[00:19:49.873 --> 00:19:50.374]  It's coming.
[00:19:50.374 --> 00:19:50.734]  It's coming.
[00:19:50.734 --> 00:19:51.334]  It's coming.
[00:19:51.334 --> 00:19:51.855]  It's coming.
[00:19:51.855 --> 00:19:52.515]  It's coming.
[00:19:52.515 --> 00:19:52.956]  It's coming.
[00:19:52.956 --> 00:19:53.316]  It's coming.
[00:19:53.316 --> 00:19:53.796]  It's coming.
[00:19:53.796 --> 00:19:54.217]  It's coming.
[00:19:54.217 --> 00:19:54.577]  It's coming.
[00:19:54.577 --> 00:19:55.017]  It's coming.
[00:19:55.017 --> 00:19:55.718]  It's coming.
[00:19:55.718 --> 00:19:56.018]  It's coming.
[00:19:56.018 --> 00:19:56.799]  It's coming.
[00:19:56.799 --> 00:19:59.180]  It's coming.
[00:19:59.180 --> 00:19:59.841]  It's coming.
[00:19:59.841 --> 00:20:00.381]  It's coming.
[00:20:00.381 --> 00:20:00.862]  It's coming.
[00:20:00.862 --> 00:20:01.322]  It's coming.
[00:20:01.322 --> 00:20:01.722]  It's coming.
[00:20:01.722 --> 00:20:02.183]  It's coming.
[00:20:02.183 --> 00:20:02.543]  It's coming.
[00:20:02.543 --> 00:20:03.103]  It's coming.
[00:20:03.103 --> 00:20:03.524]  It's coming.
[00:20:03.524 --> 00:20:04.064]  It's coming.
[00:20:04.064 --> 00:20:04.384]  It's coming.
[00:20:04.384 --> 00:20:04.785]  It's coming.
[00:20:04.785 --> 00:20:05.085]  It's coming.
[00:20:05.085 --> 00:20:05.145]  It
[00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:26.163]  I'm gonna explain how it all works right now.
[00:20:26.163 --> 00:20:33.486]  And people can either listen to me, and understand the enemy plan, and stop it, or you can die!
[00:20:35.891 --> 00:20:39.754]  Now let's go into it right now.
[00:20:39.754 --> 00:20:50.922]  Let's lay it out for everybody very slowly, very succinctly, very calmly.
[00:20:50.922 --> 00:21:03.452]  Christians created the modern world and humans were finally able, because of the Renaissance and Christianity and a mixture of things that developed,
[00:21:05.402 --> 00:21:12.265]  To build a high-tech industrialized world and it took 500 years to do it.
[00:21:12.265 --> 00:21:19.748]  Just a solar flare hitting the planet right could end our industrial civilization just like that.
[00:21:19.748 --> 00:21:29.131]  Frying every power line across entire continents that would cause a chain reaction that would bring down civilization.
[00:21:29.131 --> 00:21:33.853]  Because we've built everything very tenuously with just enough power
[00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:37.342]  Just enough wiring.
[00:21:37.342 --> 00:21:41.045]  Everything is just on time delivery.
[00:21:41.045 --> 00:21:55.858]  You put a wrinkle into that, you upset that with a year plus lockdown on the third world, that sends ripples into the first world that devastate economies and consolidate control.
[00:21:55.858 --> 00:21:59.101]  That was only a test, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:22:05.988 --> 00:22:26.037]  And now because overall governments and corporations and media went along with it, and they got away with it, and they got away with suppressing cures, and they got away with suppressing illnesses and vaccine damage, because so far they've gotten away with it, not completely, but they've gotten away with it, they're going ahead with the next phase.
[00:22:26.037 --> 00:22:26.697]  And it's all right here.
[00:22:28.641 --> 00:22:32.722]  The former head of Health and Human Services under Obama, and that means the head of Health and Human Services.
[00:22:32.722 --> 00:22:34.022]  Obama runs the show.
[00:22:34.022 --> 00:22:36.723]  It's that former administration is in command right now.
[00:22:36.723 --> 00:22:38.124]  On record.
[00:22:38.124 --> 00:22:38.744]  They don't even deny it.
[00:22:38.744 --> 00:22:41.404]  He's got his own White House, half mile from the White House.
[00:22:41.404 --> 00:22:44.825]  His own compound, three buildings, everything.
[00:22:44.825 --> 00:22:54.448]  And she said, people, we'll play the clip next segment, that don't take these shots, these experimental shots that have killed so many people, right off the bat, imagine the long term effect,
[00:22:55.723 --> 00:23:00.887]  They shouldn't be able to have access to children, including their own children, shouldn't be able to have jobs.
[00:23:00.887 --> 00:23:01.868]  So fire you!
[00:23:01.868 --> 00:23:03.229]  Put you on the street.
[00:23:03.229 --> 00:23:04.590]  That's total war.
[00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:06.091]  Violation of the Nuremberg Code, right there.
[00:23:06.091 --> 00:23:09.414]  You shouldn't have access to children, including your own children.
[00:23:09.414 --> 00:23:13.477]  So you should lose your job and lose your children.
[00:23:13.477 --> 00:23:14.457]  What did I tell you about the U.N.
[00:23:14.457 --> 00:23:18.941]  saying, we want to go into the homes and take the children out of the families, remember?
[00:23:18.941 --> 00:23:20.862]  That's the Holy Grail, is take your children.
[00:23:20.862 --> 00:23:22.824]  If they can't kill them in the womb, they're going to get them later.
[00:23:23.553 --> 00:23:31.318]  So remember, the target is always our youth from this species, or whatever these things are that inhabit humans now, and I believe it's extraterrestrial.
[00:23:31.318 --> 00:23:32.479]  And I don't say that to be shocking.
[00:23:32.479 --> 00:23:34.240]  It's not human.
[00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:35.801]  Everybody knows that now.
[00:23:35.801 --> 00:23:37.602]  I don't get into what it is or how it operates.
[00:23:37.602 --> 00:23:39.303]  The Bible says it's fallen.
[00:23:39.303 --> 00:23:40.484]  It operates in the fourth dimension.
[00:23:40.484 --> 00:23:44.587]  In the third dimension, it's bad news.
[00:23:44.587 --> 00:23:45.908]  And it wants our kids.
[00:23:45.908 --> 00:23:52.092]  Just like you want to pull over after work and get a cold beer, maybe an ice cream cone or a cheeseburger or something, they want your children's essence.
[00:23:53.081 --> 00:23:57.643]  And the whole world is designed to get the children.
[00:23:57.643 --> 00:23:59.784]  And as soon as you realize that, everything flows.
[00:23:59.784 --> 00:24:03.285]  Like Christ said, Satan wants to target the children.
[00:24:03.285 --> 00:24:08.487]  And if you don't protect them, and if you don't suffer for them, that's what suffer the children.
[00:24:08.487 --> 00:24:11.528]  Suffer for the children, or I'm going to destroy your soul.
[00:24:11.528 --> 00:24:15.149]  Real simple directive, isn't it?
[00:24:15.149 --> 00:24:17.810]  Number one job, protect the children.
[00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:21.672]  And that means old people, that means mentally retarded people, that means weak people.
[00:24:22.483 --> 00:24:23.784]  What's the new World War Directive?
[00:24:23.784 --> 00:24:26.366]  Kill the weak, kill the weak, kill the weak, kill the weak.
[00:24:26.366 --> 00:24:28.167]  Oh, but they don't just mean kill the weak, do they?
[00:24:28.167 --> 00:24:41.855]  They want to kill every one of us, and if they can trick us to kill the weak, when our whole system and our impetus is... Even somebody that isn't a big tough guy, somebody starts beating their kid up, they'll beat the hell out of them.
[00:24:41.855 --> 00:24:43.356]  Even people that aren't looking for a fight.
[00:24:43.356 --> 00:24:50.041]  You start picking on some old man or some old woman, just an average guy will get up and kick the hell out of some big bully, because he's just pissed off about it.
[00:24:50.041 --> 00:24:51.842]  Pick a chair up, smash it over their head!
[00:24:52.515 --> 00:24:58.658]  Because our spirit doesn't like messing with weak people!
[00:24:58.658 --> 00:25:05.262]  But this satanic system loves abusing the living hell out of it!
[00:25:05.262 --> 00:25:10.985]  And all of existence on this planet is about getting in the position of deciding which side you're on.
[00:25:10.985 --> 00:25:12.245]  Alright, I'm gonna stop.
[00:25:12.245 --> 00:25:14.066]  You know, I try to get up here and be calm.
[00:25:14.066 --> 00:25:17.528]  You know, in person, in private, I'm super slick.
[00:25:18.884 --> 00:25:24.367]  By that I mean talking to a woman or relaxed, I sound like very white.
[00:25:24.367 --> 00:25:32.510]  But you know, I get up here on air and I sound like a frantic person because I am frantic, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:34.051]  I'm desperate.
[00:25:34.051 --> 00:25:40.314]  I'm watching everything unfold and instead everybody's like, boy, I bet you're happy, you've got a lot of credibility right now.
[00:25:40.314 --> 00:25:46.597]  It's like, I'm the dam operator, I see the dam break, I radio down to the town five miles away that, you know,
[00:25:47.589 --> 00:25:49.610]  Billions of gallons is coming to kill you in five minutes.
[00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:52.712]  And they go, boy, I bet you're feeling like a hero right now.
[00:25:52.712 --> 00:25:54.593]  You told us the dam broke.
[00:25:54.593 --> 00:25:58.776]  Forgot when to... What does that even mean?
[00:26:01.272 --> 00:26:23.649]  So, I am not going to sit here, like I did 30 years ago, and 20 years ago, and 10 years ago, and 5 years ago, and a year ago, and be sitting here, not even on air in a year probably, with total death and bedlam and war and martial law and starvation going on, zombie apocalypse basically is what they've been planning, and that's how the average person acts in about a week without food.
[00:26:23.649 --> 00:26:27.912]  I'm not going to be sitting here going, oh isn't it great, I've been proven right again!
[00:26:27.912 --> 00:26:29.313]  It won't matter then!
[00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:34.713]  And so I could feel the earnestness.
[00:26:34.713 --> 00:26:37.174]  I could feel the concern.
[00:26:37.174 --> 00:26:41.818]  I could intellectually see all the pieces of it.
[00:26:41.818 --> 00:26:50.925]  And like I said, my biggest frustration is, and I'll just say this all on air, I can't get, I guess I just got to be a leader and decide what I'm going to do.
[00:26:50.925 --> 00:26:52.466]  You know, because I can't blame my family.
[00:26:52.466 --> 00:26:54.868]  I can't blame anybody about not knowing what to do.
[00:26:54.868 --> 00:26:56.970]  People are like, okay, well, let's go watch a movie.
[00:26:57.629 --> 00:27:00.970]  Go watch a movie with all this going on, or hey, let's go down and get a steak.
[00:27:00.970 --> 00:27:05.832]  Yeah, or let's go to our neighbor's house and drink martinis.
[00:27:05.832 --> 00:27:08.092]  That's all gone, folks!
[00:27:08.092 --> 00:27:10.073]  And I'm not bitching at you because you want a martini.
[00:27:10.073 --> 00:27:11.934]  You don't think I don't want one?
[00:27:11.934 --> 00:27:17.955]  I cannot sit here while this is going down and not act like it's a big deal!
[00:27:17.955 --> 00:27:19.976]  And let's get something real straight for everybody.
[00:27:19.976 --> 00:27:24.017]  COVID-19's a real virus and it's killed a bunch of people.
[00:27:24.017 --> 00:27:25.778]  And they're getting ready to release ones that are far worse.
[00:27:27.975 --> 00:27:32.337]  And I've tried to unpack and explain that to everybody.
[00:27:32.337 --> 00:27:39.481]  But it's not as deadly as they said, and the solutions they have were not the solutions, and they suppressed the cures because they're mass murderers.
[00:27:39.481 --> 00:27:49.066]  And so it's hard for me to look at Fauci or Bill Gates, who are mass murderers, and have killed people I know, and to sit there and take it.
[00:27:49.066 --> 00:27:54.669]  Because if I sit there and take it, it means I'm going to take it more when they kill me and my family, and I'm not going to sit there and take it.
[00:27:54.669 --> 00:27:55.610]  You got that, Bill Gates?
[00:27:57.581 --> 00:28:01.327]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[00:28:01.327 --> 00:28:05.053]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years, and only the last year or so have I said that.
[00:28:05.053 --> 00:28:07.658]  But let me tell you, the New World Order's breathing down our neck.
[00:28:08.308 --> 00:28:12.691]  The big globalist publications are coming after us, and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[00:28:12.691 --> 00:28:18.456]  So please pray to keep InfoWars on the air, and please support the local station you're listening to as well.
[00:28:18.456 --> 00:28:30.065]  At the same time, go to InfoWarsStore.com while you still can, and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt, get some supplements, because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing.
[00:28:30.665 --> 00:28:32.787]  I need your help more than ever now.
[00:28:32.787 --> 00:28:36.910]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[00:28:36.910 --> 00:28:47.518]  So, pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can, and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:28:47.518 --> 00:28:57.065]  Whether it's high quality coffee, or supplements, or books or films, all of it nurtures the soul, all of it empowers humanity, all of it is pro-human and pro-God.
[00:28:57.065 --> 00:28:57.726]  Thank you so much.
[00:28:58.366 --> 00:29:02.148]  Alex Jones here with two big announcements in the next 60 seconds.
[00:29:02.148 --> 00:29:04.629]  First off, green fiber capsules.
[00:29:04.629 --> 00:29:09.491]  Highest quality fiber you're going to find with all the amino acids and a ton of vitamins and minerals.
[00:29:09.491 --> 00:29:10.992]  This is an incredible formula.
[00:29:10.992 --> 00:29:12.412]  Everybody should be taking it.
[00:29:12.412 --> 00:29:15.394]  Men, women, children, old, young, black, white, it doesn't matter.
[00:29:15.394 --> 00:29:16.534]  It's an amazing product.
[00:29:16.534 --> 00:29:17.715]  It's our newest product.
[00:29:17.715 --> 00:29:19.896]  It's 50% off out of the gates.
[00:29:19.896 --> 00:29:20.716]  Infowarshore.com.
[00:29:20.976 --> 00:29:22.658]  Then we have both types of X2.
[00:29:22.658 --> 00:29:29.584]  It's the exact same X2 in the bottle, but one has a spray cap, one has a dropper cap for 60% and 40% off, depending on which one.
[00:29:29.584 --> 00:29:31.747]  They're both excellent at Infowarshaw.com.
[00:29:31.747 --> 00:29:39.234]  The 60% off of the spray bottle is unprecedented, but I want you to experience the power of the good halogen and learn about the iodine conspiracy.
[00:29:39.454 --> 00:29:41.715]  It's all available at InfowarStore.com.
[00:29:41.715 --> 00:29:50.060]  The new green fiber capsules, 50% off, and X2 in the spray bottle and in the dropper bottle for 60 and 40% off.
[00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:51.521]  And it funds the Infowar.
[00:29:51.521 --> 00:29:56.464]  Experience Deep Earth Crystal Iodine for itself and keep your gut healthy at InfowarStore.com.
[00:29:58.616 --> 00:30:10.644]  Bioremediation is a process used to treat contaminating water, soil, and subsurface material by accelerating naturally occurring environmental conditions to stimulate growth of microorganisms and degrade targeted pollutants.
[00:30:10.644 --> 00:30:17.729]  For the first time, the BioPros are bringing to the public market a suite of bioremediation products to the everyday consumer.
[00:30:17.729 --> 00:30:19.610]  Their first product they are launching is called
[00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:24.893]  BioSeptic Pro, a product specifically designed to establish a healthy septic system.
[00:30:24.893 --> 00:30:29.717]  BioSeptic Pro contains live microorganisms, not traditional enzymes like its competitors.
[00:30:29.717 --> 00:30:31.678]  This stuff lives in your septic system.
[00:30:31.678 --> 00:30:40.824]  It's really like probiotics for your septic tank and is at least 100 times more effective than similar microbial products due to its revolutionary patented delivery system.
[00:30:41.004 --> 00:30:45.807]  Bioseptic Pro contains no chemical ingredients and no genetically modified organisms.
[00:30:45.807 --> 00:30:49.949]  Visit TheBiopros.com today and protect your septic system.
[00:30:49.949 --> 00:30:51.970]  That's TheBiopros.com.
[00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:56.112]  This is for anaerobic septic tanks and the job it does is unparalleled.
[00:30:56.112 --> 00:31:00.354]  TheBiopros.com.
[00:31:00.354 --> 00:31:02.976]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:31:15.222 --> 00:31:15.783]  Oh, baby.
[00:31:15.783 --> 00:31:16.143]  Oh, baby.
[00:31:16.143 --> 00:31:17.184]  Keep on.
[00:31:17.184 --> 00:31:18.266]  Right, baby.
[00:31:18.266 --> 00:31:19.367]  Keep on doing it.
[00:31:19.367 --> 00:31:19.988]  Right on.
[00:31:19.988 --> 00:31:20.829]  Right on doing it.
[00:31:36.866 --> 00:31:42.369]  All right, folks, welcome back.
[00:31:42.369 --> 00:31:44.850]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live.
[00:31:47.498 --> 00:31:52.121]  Wednesday broadcast, July 14th.
[00:31:52.121 --> 00:31:54.903]  I am seriously having trouble doing the show.
[00:31:54.903 --> 00:32:01.347]  In fact, I think things are bad enough I may just not do the show for a month and just walk out of here next segment and not come back for a while.
[00:32:01.347 --> 00:32:04.329]  Just to get everybody paying attention how serious it is.
[00:32:04.329 --> 00:32:06.590]  Because just screaming and yelling up here isn't going to do anything, obviously.
[00:32:08.709 --> 00:32:11.190]  Because people don't get what they're being hit by.
[00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:11.850]  The end.
[00:32:11.850 --> 00:32:12.831]  The takeover.
[00:32:12.831 --> 00:32:14.391]  The post-industrial world.
[00:32:14.391 --> 00:32:20.934]  The forced depopulation of the planet.
[00:32:20.934 --> 00:32:21.754]  In fact, I have to!
[00:32:21.754 --> 00:32:27.396]  I cannot do this radio show and just sit up here and normalize everything!
[00:32:27.396 --> 00:32:29.137]  The party is over!
[00:32:33.129 --> 00:32:34.950]  I'm not wrong, I'm right!
[00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:47.158]  I told you every damn thing that was going to happen because I've got these murdering criminals planning it all out and I've got all their damn documents right here!
[00:32:47.158 --> 00:32:59.705]  You think they're going to stop with the outrageous announcement that the Democratic Party is going to run telecoms and read all your text messages in live time and tell you what you can send and what you can't?
[00:32:59.705 --> 00:33:00.986]  I mean, if that ain't enough of a
[00:33:02.072 --> 00:33:11.514]  Five-star raping than what did Kathleen Sebelius, former head of Health and Human Services under Obama, come out and say?
[00:33:11.514 --> 00:33:14.255]  She said, we don't just want to make it tough on people.
[00:33:14.255 --> 00:33:17.756]  Don't take these deadly, experimentally illegal shots.
[00:33:17.756 --> 00:33:21.697]  We need to make sure they lose their job!
[00:33:21.697 --> 00:33:23.097]  Because they're nice liberals.
[00:33:23.097 --> 00:33:23.937]  They want to save us.
[00:33:23.937 --> 00:33:25.738]  They care so much about us.
[00:33:25.738 --> 00:33:28.298]  I'm an old person they couldn't kill or a baby they couldn't abort.
[00:33:28.298 --> 00:33:30.659]  But they love you now, just like Bill Gates does.
[00:33:31.937 --> 00:33:37.416]  She says they shouldn't have access to children, including their own children!
[00:33:38.996 --> 00:33:46.381]  When these are the people putting those dirty, filthy diapers on their faces that give them bacterial pneumonia.
[00:33:46.381 --> 00:33:50.043]  And then all these political whores sit up there and nod their heads.
[00:33:50.043 --> 00:33:58.369]  And I've got MSNBC reporters and CNN reporters saying, oh, I'm not inviting any family over to Thanksgiving that doesn't have their vaccine passport.
[00:33:58.369 --> 00:33:59.810]  That's not a cult or anything.
[00:33:59.810 --> 00:34:04.973]  Oh, I've had my vaccine, which by the way, I told you this was coming because it was all in the Bill Gates plan over a year ago.
[00:34:07.205 --> 00:34:13.168]  None of the vaccines have any value.
[00:34:13.168 --> 00:34:14.969]  They don't even protect you from COVID.
[00:34:14.969 --> 00:34:29.856]  They never could, and the scientists all said that, the real virologists, but most people didn't get to hear from them because they were all censored in live time by big tech.
[00:34:29.856 --> 00:34:32.377]  And then you got all the weirdos that have signed on to this abomination.
[00:34:35.777 --> 00:34:46.820]  I want to give the number out specifically for first-time callers on operational considerations for community isolation centers COVID-19 in low resource settings.
[00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:57.603]  That's just one CDC document from a year ago and then a new one in March, re-updated March 18th this year, about setting up these emergency centers all over the United States.
[00:34:57.603 --> 00:35:02.004]  The same ones they've set up in Canada and Australia and Europe and the same stuff going on.
[00:35:02.004 --> 00:35:02.744]  It's all being announced.
[00:35:03.382 --> 00:35:04.803]  You know, Tucker talked about it back then.
[00:35:04.803 --> 00:35:08.626]  Tucker Carlson, COVID internment camps, coming soon.
[00:35:08.626 --> 00:35:12.789]  Well, they're not coming soon now.
[00:35:12.789 --> 00:35:15.491]  They're here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:15.491 --> 00:35:17.112]  And it's all UN run.
[00:35:17.112 --> 00:35:21.256]  You don't think the UN would just show up with soldiers and say, we're here to take your guns.
[00:35:21.256 --> 00:35:22.817]  And you just, oh, here are my guns.
[00:35:22.817 --> 00:35:24.038]  That would start a civil war.
[00:35:24.038 --> 00:35:24.778]  They'd lose.
[00:35:24.778 --> 00:35:25.579]  It's an outside force.
[00:35:28.712 --> 00:35:29.833]  The traitors and the patriots.
[00:35:29.833 --> 00:35:30.633]  We'd win.
[00:35:30.633 --> 00:35:47.065]  But if it's under a virus and under race war and, oh, the people that don't want to turn their guns in and take all these special shots, they're all secretly white supremacist and, you know, we've got to arrest them and get them and they're not safe and you need to take your shots so you're safe and we're just a medical group coming door to door to...
[00:35:52.401 --> 00:35:54.202]  It's all being rolled out.
[00:35:54.202 --> 00:35:58.803]  So, at the very start of the show, some of you may have missed it, I aired a very powerful Gregory's Report.
[00:35:58.803 --> 00:36:06.465]  All his reports are important, but this one's right up there at the top of his most important called, This Is The End.
[00:36:06.465 --> 00:36:14.988]  If you don't wake up, because that's how incrementalism works, that's how successive approximation works, that's how the frog gets put in the pot and it's slowly turned up.
[00:36:16.224 --> 00:36:18.105]  That psychology's all being employed.
[00:36:18.105 --> 00:36:23.229]  Well, finally, in the middle of 2021, it's, we're reading all your text messages and are going to censor them.
[00:36:23.229 --> 00:36:26.091]  The DNC, not just the NSA.
[00:36:26.091 --> 00:36:28.192]  Oh, but Tucker's crazy because he says he's being spied on.
[00:36:28.192 --> 00:36:29.213]  But we're spying on you.
[00:36:29.213 --> 00:36:30.434]  We're spying on all of you.
[00:36:30.434 --> 00:36:32.195]  And oh yeah, we're going to put you in camps.
[00:36:32.195 --> 00:36:33.596]  And oh yeah, the vaccine doesn't work.
[00:36:33.596 --> 00:36:38.219]  And that's killing a bunch of people, but big deal.
[00:36:38.219 --> 00:36:40.701]  Oh, and illegal aliens coming across the border, they're exempt from all this.
[00:36:43.197 --> 00:36:45.979]  And they're triggering riots all over the world with the ongoing lockdown.
[00:36:45.979 --> 00:36:46.799]  So here's the report.
[00:36:46.799 --> 00:37:03.269]  We're going to come back and play Kathleen Sebelius and her declaration of war, saying you're going to be homeless on the street, your children taken if you don't let us put this in you, because we love you so much.
[00:37:03.269 --> 00:37:11.114]  As far as the public was concerned, the Nazis may have lost the war, but their ideology has continued to spread ever since.
[00:37:12.162 --> 00:37:25.812]  Following World War II came the United Nations, mass fluoridation of the water supply, the dumbing down of the education system, post-modernism, political correctness, and the war on drugs.
[00:37:25.812 --> 00:37:28.434]  For many, this has gone unnoticed.
[00:37:28.434 --> 00:37:32.097]  The Nazis became the pop culture model of fascism.
[00:37:32.097 --> 00:37:36.680]  Black leather and jack boots became the symbols of authoritarianism.
[00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:41.344]  Fascism could now hide itself behind a smile in a suit and a tie.
[00:37:42.268 --> 00:37:49.590]  The majority had no idea of the global fascist state being slowly installed behind the scenes.
[00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:51.370]  And now it's here.
[00:37:51.370 --> 00:37:54.151]  COVID was just the beginning of their endgame.
[00:37:54.151 --> 00:38:02.733]  The same private corporations and NGOs that planned and executed the COVID hoax are now preparing the next phase.
[00:38:02.733 --> 00:38:05.874]  We can soon expect a massive cyber attack.
[00:38:05.874 --> 00:38:10.955]  We all know, but still pay insufficient attention
[00:38:12.108 --> 00:38:28.592]  To the frightening scenario of a comprehensive cyber attack which would bring to a complete halt to the power supply, transportation, hospital services, our society as a whole.
[00:38:29.787 --> 00:38:38.752]  The COVID-19 crisis would be seen in this respect as a small disturbance in comparison.
[00:38:38.752 --> 00:38:52.519]  The World Economic Forum, who sponsored tabletop simulations for COVID just weeks before the outbreak, are now doing the same for cyberattacks, which will be the reset button needed for their great reset.
[00:38:54.432 --> 00:39:02.817]  And when the grid goes down, it will take banking and shipping down with it, killing millions in the overcrowded cities.
[00:39:02.817 --> 00:39:17.947]  Those with a survival instinct will leave the cities, which is why the Rural Domestic Preparedness Consortium, a part of Homeland Security and FEMA, is currently training for the isolation and quarantine of rural communities.
[00:39:17.947 --> 00:39:22.730]  After their great reset, we know how they plan to build back better.
[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:40.128]  Two key agents of the Great Reset, Regina Dugan and Ken Gabriel, both worked for DARPA, Greenlit RNA Vaccine Research in 2012, and then went on to Google and Facebook, where they set up DARPA Equivalents.
[00:39:40.128 --> 00:39:45.671]  In 2018, they joined Welcome Leap, founded by the world's richest medical research foundation.
[00:39:47.043 --> 00:40:01.009]  Their stated goal, to be completed no later than 2030, is to have 80% of all children under the age of 3 monitored 24-7 with wearable devices that will read their brain patterns.
[00:40:01.009 --> 00:40:06.852]  Specifically, focusing on keeping the individual motivated to work.
[00:40:06.852 --> 00:40:16.336]  They plan to have an in-silico model of a child's brain to be used as the model brain that all infants will be molded to via therapeutic interventions.
[00:40:17.902 --> 00:40:21.103]  Like slaves in a dystopian sci-fi movie.
[00:40:21.103 --> 00:40:22.924]  Except this is not a movie.
[00:40:22.924 --> 00:40:26.005]  And it's no longer a conspiracy theory.
[00:40:26.005 --> 00:40:27.986]  It's all happening.
[00:40:27.986 --> 00:40:30.787]  The entire world is under attack.
[00:40:30.787 --> 00:40:33.428]  With seemingly no pushback.
[00:40:33.428 --> 00:40:37.210]  And if we don't push back, then it's all over.
[00:40:37.210 --> 00:40:40.751]  And we have nobody to blame but ourselves.
[00:40:40.751 --> 00:40:42.672]  For InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[00:40:45.874 --> 00:40:47.136]  That's all real documents.
[00:40:47.136 --> 00:40:55.631]  They're gonna take your children at birth, hook them into a face suit that programs them in a matrix-like system to be total slaves to these monsters.
[00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:58.862]  I never had a marketing plan for Impulse Wars.
[00:40:58.862 --> 00:41:03.125]  I went out and found the best products I could find from the research to fund our operation.
[00:41:03.125 --> 00:41:07.808]  I wanted you to get products that empowered you, that you loved, so you'd want to come back and buy more.
[00:41:07.808 --> 00:41:09.369]  I treat you like I want to be treated.
[00:41:09.369 --> 00:41:10.370]  It's very, very simple.
[00:41:10.370 --> 00:41:11.371]  It's instinctive.
[00:41:11.371 --> 00:41:11.951]  It's spiritual.
[00:41:11.951 --> 00:41:12.712]  It's what I do.
[00:41:12.712 --> 00:41:16.134]  And that said, our iodine products have become our best sellers.
[00:41:16.134 --> 00:41:23.059]  And X2 right now is discounted because listeners and viewers are habituated to only buy it when it's on sale.
[00:41:23.619 --> 00:41:24.800]  And so I'm going to catch 22.
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:27.082]  When I don't have it on sale, I don't sell it.
[00:41:27.082 --> 00:41:31.965]  But we're selling out of all our other products because of supply chain breakdowns, and so I'm going to catch 22.
[00:41:31.965 --> 00:41:33.987]  I need to sell products at full price, but I can't.
[00:41:33.987 --> 00:41:35.808]  I've got to sell them at discount.
[00:41:35.808 --> 00:41:37.069]  And so, it's discounted.
[00:41:37.069 --> 00:41:42.453]  40% off for the dropper bottle, 60% off for the spray bottle, even though it's about to sell out.
[00:41:42.453 --> 00:41:43.594]  It won't be available for months.
[00:41:44.054 --> 00:41:45.055]  So get it.
[00:41:45.055 --> 00:41:51.662]  X2 is selling out at InfoWarsTore.com for 40% and 60% off with double patreon points and free shipping.
[00:41:51.662 --> 00:41:52.222]  Because why?
[00:41:52.222 --> 00:41:53.644]  That's when you buy it.
[00:41:53.644 --> 00:41:55.145]  We need your funds or we'll be off air.
[00:41:55.145 --> 00:41:57.428]  It's an amazing product.
[00:41:57.428 --> 00:42:05.616]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[00:42:06.906 --> 00:42:11.650]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date.
[00:42:11.650 --> 00:42:13.992]  Super Male Vitality!
[00:42:13.992 --> 00:42:22.839]  Specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality in males.
[00:42:22.839 --> 00:42:34.008]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[00:42:34.008 --> 00:42:34.228]  Yes.
[00:42:34.668 --> 00:42:39.592]  We're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology.
[00:42:39.592 --> 00:42:46.377]  Working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[00:42:46.377 --> 00:42:47.558]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:42:47.558 --> 00:42:49.380]  Go to the InfoWars store.
[00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:52.242]  Never been a better time than right now.
[00:42:52.242 --> 00:42:55.744]  Super Male Vitality at InfoWarsStore.com
[00:43:01.048 --> 00:43:02.329]  Jacob in Ohio.
[00:43:02.329 --> 00:43:02.709]  Welcome.
[00:43:02.709 --> 00:43:03.149]  Go ahead.
[00:43:03.149 --> 00:43:04.470]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:05.030]  Good, man.
[00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:06.131]  Great last caller.
[00:43:06.131 --> 00:43:09.173]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[00:43:09.173 --> 00:43:14.876]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, demoralization, and absurdity.
[00:43:14.876 --> 00:43:16.657]  It's like we're living in a Twilight Zone, man.
[00:43:17.037 --> 00:43:18.658]  All right, Eric in New Hampshire.
[00:43:18.658 --> 00:43:19.599]  Eric, thanks for calling.
[00:43:19.599 --> 00:43:19.979]  Go ahead.
[00:43:19.979 --> 00:43:20.379]  Hey, Alex.
[00:43:20.379 --> 00:43:21.520]  Thanks for taking my call.
[00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:24.542]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for one of the products.
[00:43:24.542 --> 00:43:26.223]  The XG does wonders.
[00:43:26.223 --> 00:43:27.443]  I recommend it to everybody.
[00:43:27.443 --> 00:43:28.524]  You're on the fence about it.
[00:43:28.524 --> 00:43:29.325]  Get off the fence.
[00:43:29.325 --> 00:43:30.205]  Get the product.
[00:43:30.205 --> 00:43:31.386]  Support the Infowar.
[00:43:31.386 --> 00:43:32.707]  Tyler in Maine.
[00:43:32.707 --> 00:43:33.287]  You're on the air.
[00:43:33.287 --> 00:43:33.927]  Thanks for holding.
[00:43:33.927 --> 00:43:34.488]  Go ahead.
[00:43:34.488 --> 00:43:34.928]  Hey, Alex.
[00:43:34.928 --> 00:43:36.069]  It's great to be on with you.
[00:43:36.069 --> 00:43:36.569]  It's an honor.
[00:43:36.789 --> 00:43:38.491]  I'm honored to talk to you.
[00:43:38.491 --> 00:43:38.931]  Awesome.
[00:43:38.931 --> 00:43:42.314]  So, first thing I wanted to do is to say I love the products.
[00:43:42.314 --> 00:43:44.396]  Alpha Power, even at 29.
[00:43:44.396 --> 00:43:46.878]  If you ask my better half, she loves it.
[00:43:46.878 --> 00:43:48.240]  And it helps in the bedroom.
[00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:49.821]  So, just number one for a few reasons.
[00:43:49.821 --> 00:43:50.802]  Well, it definitely works.
[00:43:50.802 --> 00:43:52.524]  It's not a joke.
[00:43:52.524 --> 00:43:53.244]  Absolutely.
[00:43:58.095 --> 00:44:06.277]  I preach about the dangers of cell phones all day long because they're supercomputers controlled by big tech that are spying on us everywhere we go and what we do.
[00:44:06.277 --> 00:44:15.039]  But because they have great cameras and great recording systems and great ways to communicate, I still have one because this Trojan horse, this Promethean Fire, has a lot of power.
[00:44:15.039 --> 00:44:21.980]  But when I'm not using it, I lock it up in a high-quality Faraday cage, a privacy pocket, at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:24.620]  We finally got them back in stock, the highest rated.
[00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:27.041]  They fit almost all types of Androids and iPhones.
[00:44:27.481 --> 00:44:28.021]  I think?
[00:44:47.308 --> 00:44:55.192]  This is a great way to limit your phone time use, it's a great way to spend more time with your family, and it's a great way to know you're not being tracked by the criminal globalist system.
[00:44:55.192 --> 00:44:59.894]  They're 50% off right now at m4warstore.com.
[00:44:59.894 --> 00:45:02.515]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:46:03.607 --> 00:46:09.770]  Ladies and gentlemen, I want to give the phone number out in the second and third hour today, but I'll do that at the start of the next hour.
[00:46:09.770 --> 00:46:14.412]  And we'll take your phone calls.
[00:46:14.412 --> 00:46:14.612]  But...
[00:46:16.568 --> 00:46:22.731]  It's almost a crime to just sit up here and cover all this in the middle of a war and just act like it's more political news.
[00:46:22.731 --> 00:46:29.955]  That's why I can't cover the Democrats all drunk on private jet airplanes leaving Texas to try to block your laws that stop their fraud.
[00:46:29.955 --> 00:46:40.821]  That's why it's hard to cover all this other incredibly interesting news because the big mothership, the big New World Order depopulation program is orchestrating all of this.
[00:46:41.681 --> 00:46:50.745]  And so we can fight all these little million battles all day long, or we can wake up and arrest Bill Gates!
[00:46:50.745 --> 00:46:54.286]  We can stop Klaus Schwab!
[00:46:54.286 --> 00:47:01.829]  We can stop their puppet!
[00:47:01.829 --> 00:47:08.012]  So, let me give you a couple of reports, because I've got to go check on something right now.
[00:47:08.012 --> 00:47:08.392]  Is he here?
[00:47:10.477 --> 00:47:12.306]  Okay, just wanted to get that thing answered.
[00:47:12.306 --> 00:47:13.090]  I really appreciate that.
[00:47:19.554 --> 00:47:21.054]  You know what?
[00:47:21.054 --> 00:47:22.675]  I may just stop this.
[00:47:22.675 --> 00:47:23.235]  Absolutely.
[00:47:23.235 --> 00:47:23.595]  You know what?
[00:47:23.595 --> 00:47:24.995]  It's up to the public at this point.
[00:47:24.995 --> 00:47:25.815]  I'm going to rebroadcast.
[00:47:25.815 --> 00:47:26.695]  I'm leaving.
[00:47:26.695 --> 00:47:28.516]  You guys just knock yourselves out.
[00:47:28.516 --> 00:47:33.737]  Hell, let's air a bunch of clips of people saying they're slaves, gotta stay in their houses, can't have access to children.
[00:47:33.737 --> 00:47:34.717]  Here, let's just play a bunch of those.
[00:47:34.717 --> 00:47:35.937]  Let's just hear from the enemy.
[00:47:35.937 --> 00:47:40.338]  Let's have some, what do you call it here on air?
[00:47:40.338 --> 00:47:40.758]  What they want?
[00:47:40.758 --> 00:47:42.018]  The Fairness Doctrine.
[00:47:42.018 --> 00:47:46.359]  Let's have some Fairness Doctrine here on air.
[00:47:46.359 --> 00:47:47.519]  Got a bunch of those for you here.
[00:47:48.775 --> 00:47:59.643]  We got Sebelius, former head of Health and Human Services, saying Americans should not be allowed to work, have access to children, including their children.
[00:47:59.643 --> 00:48:03.226]  Yeah, let's play folks a clip, here it is.
[00:48:03.226 --> 00:48:04.948]  Well, it's horrifying.
[00:48:04.948 --> 00:48:12.433]  I don't know any cancer patient who, if they were offered a shot that was 90% effective, wouldn't take it in a heartbeat.
[00:48:14.617 --> 00:48:28.509]  So we are in a situation where we have a wildly effective vaccine, multiple choices, lots available, free of charge, and we have folks who are just saying, I won't do it.
[00:48:28.509 --> 00:48:37.477]  I think that it's time to say to those folks, it's fine if you don't choose to get vaccinated, you may not
[00:48:38.086 --> 00:48:39.286]  Shut that pig up!
[00:48:39.286 --> 00:48:40.927]  Shut that pig up!
[00:48:40.927 --> 00:48:43.168]  Hey listen you globalist pig!
[00:48:43.168 --> 00:48:48.470]  We all know you love death and aborting babies and killing old people so shut your filthy demonic
[00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:09.841]  Stinking mouth!
[00:49:09.841 --> 00:49:15.644]  Burn in hell!
[00:49:15.644 --> 00:49:26.131]  The damn vaccine isn't a vaccine, it's a gene therapy that makes your body attack its own proteins and give you autoimmune disorders and give you an excruciatingly painful death!
[00:49:26.131 --> 00:49:31.033]  You murderous monster maggot!
[00:49:31.033 --> 00:49:31.694]  They're the ones!
[00:49:32.794 --> 00:49:34.195]  Killing people all over the world!
[00:49:34.195 --> 00:49:49.720]  They're the ones attacking us with this poison vaccine that skipped all the trials and all the tests and now they put advisories all over the containers!
[00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:51.700]  Saying it can give you a heart attack!
[00:49:51.700 --> 00:49:52.721]  It can give you a stroke!
[00:49:52.721 --> 00:49:56.002]  It can give you blood clots!
[00:49:56.002 --> 00:49:56.722]  It can kill you!
[00:49:58.047 --> 00:50:07.052]  And all this pig can sit there and do is say, we're going to take your job, or take your children, or I'll let you have access to children?
[00:50:07.052 --> 00:50:10.834]  You monster.
[00:50:10.834 --> 00:50:13.055]  I'm too pissed he can be on air.
[00:50:13.055 --> 00:50:23.400]  You know, there's a really good OAN report I happened to see this morning when I was watching OAN in my office, DVR'd, where they've got Reuters and all these criminals.
[00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:26.802]  Turns out the head of Reuters is on the board, of course, of Pfizer, of course.
[00:50:28.021 --> 00:50:30.302]  And saying, oh, there's no death!
[00:50:30.302 --> 00:50:32.043]  The VAERS report's fake!
[00:50:32.043 --> 00:50:33.043]  It's all fake!
[00:50:33.043 --> 00:50:36.385]  Even though it's medical doctors and nurses saying this is happening.
[00:50:36.385 --> 00:50:44.209]  And the same Reuters suppressing treatments because they want maximum death because they're just signing on to pure Satanism.
[00:50:44.209 --> 00:50:48.691]  We got that report.
[00:50:48.691 --> 00:50:56.275]  We got it all.
[00:50:56.275 --> 00:50:56.995]  Let me just do this.
[00:50:59.858 --> 00:51:06.881]  Let me just do this.
[00:51:06.881 --> 00:51:11.162]  I mean, what is the point of even selling products to stay on air?
[00:51:11.162 --> 00:51:11.682]  Probably not.
[00:51:11.682 --> 00:51:16.404]  I mean, it's... Here's why I shouldn't be on air.
[00:51:16.404 --> 00:51:22.646]  I'm going to start saying a lot of really nasty, mean stuff, and I'm going to start really, really letting a lot of people have it, and it's just not good to do.
[00:51:22.646 --> 00:51:23.667]  I'm just going to say this.
[00:51:23.667 --> 00:51:27.128]  Everybody needs to wake up and get out of your trance now.
[00:51:27.128 --> 00:51:27.348]  You know.
[00:51:28.095 --> 00:51:32.698]  Wake up a little bit so you know what's happening to you, so you understand, see?
[00:51:32.698 --> 00:51:36.400]  Because what I'm telling you is the truth.
[00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:56.552]  And scum like that chicken-neck witch whore to the New World Order, Satan's little whore, sits up there and says she wants you to lose your job and live in a homeless camp or be put in a FEMA center because you don't take her murderous drug from the murderers at Pfizer and the murderers at Moderna and the murderer Bill Gates.
[00:52:01.048 --> 00:52:14.732]  And we all sit here like a bunch of cowards, bowing down to the big banks and all their stolen trillions, and bowing down to Big Pharma, and bowing down to Fauci, who can't even throw a baseball straight.
[00:52:14.732 --> 00:52:17.473]  He's an idiot.
[00:52:17.473 --> 00:52:19.353]  These people are nobodies.
[00:52:19.353 --> 00:52:25.655]  They are sacks of demonic filth that hate humanity, that need to be brought to justice.
[00:52:30.009 --> 00:52:31.450]  Alright, I'm going to control myself.
[00:52:31.450 --> 00:52:45.659]  I'm going to air a special report next segment, and I probably should call Owen Schroeder and get him in here, because I told myself years ago when I get one of these rages, I should not be on air, because I say things that overall are truthful, but not probably constructive in the end.
[00:52:45.659 --> 00:52:47.660]  But I just can't be around the trance anymore.
[00:52:47.660 --> 00:52:50.882]  I can't be around the undead, just all of it.
[00:52:50.882 --> 00:52:54.804]  The unconsciousness to this, it's so obvious, it's ridiculous, it's pointless.
[00:52:54.804 --> 00:52:56.125]  But oh, here, let's just do this.
[00:53:00.405 --> 00:53:10.168]  I don't know what crazy moron in their right mind would listen to this show and see everything come through we're talking about and then think I'm BSing you about iodine.
[00:53:10.168 --> 00:53:18.011]  Or that I'm BSing you that we have the best deep earth crystal source iodine that is the complete opposite of the evil halogen that the globalists bombard you with in the fluoride family.
[00:53:19.739 --> 00:53:32.430]  And so yes, I sell products, ladies and gentlemen, that literally are amazing, and that absolutely work, and I see leftist articles making jokes about the things we sell saying, I sell worthless stuff, because they said it.
[00:53:32.430 --> 00:53:35.193]  No, they're projecting they're worthless.
[00:53:35.193 --> 00:53:39.237]  Iodine is essential, and that's a scientific fact!
[00:53:39.237 --> 00:53:41.799]  And you die if you don't have it after several months.
[00:53:42.515 --> 00:53:51.664]  And that's one reason most people are in a retarded haze, is because they don't have iodine in their body.
[00:53:51.664 --> 00:53:57.129]  We have it in the spray bottle, the exact same iodine.
[00:53:57.129 --> 00:53:58.890]  Basically, it costs $12 a bottle.
[00:53:58.890 --> 00:53:59.531]  That is insane.
[00:53:59.531 --> 00:54:01.633]  That's cost.
[00:54:01.633 --> 00:54:05.616]  The dropper bottle is at 40% off.
[00:54:05.616 --> 00:54:08.199]  And it's the same damn iodine as that's on that funger operation.
[00:54:09.014 --> 00:54:12.017]  And maybe if I take a week off, I mean obviously I'm not going to quit.
[00:54:12.017 --> 00:54:13.518]  Here's what I'm saying.
[00:54:13.518 --> 00:54:14.519]  I can't sit here.
[00:54:14.519 --> 00:54:20.464]  I can't sit here and continue to play games with all this.
[00:54:20.464 --> 00:54:25.268]  I cannot sit here in the same position and then just talk about how these people are bad all day.
[00:54:25.268 --> 00:54:26.550]  And I'm not planning something.
[00:54:26.550 --> 00:54:33.416]  I'm just saying they're planning something and they're attacking us and we can't just sit here like we're in normal times.
[00:54:33.416 --> 00:54:33.736]  We're not.
[00:54:35.601 --> 00:54:40.703]  Separately to all the jack-off leftist cult members, they're like, oh, Jones sells fake vitamins.
[00:54:40.703 --> 00:54:54.229]  Oh, you think green fiber capsules from wheatgrass and a bunch of other sprouts, the highest quality concentrated fiber with all of the major amino acids and all the essential amino acids and a whole bunch of vitamins and minerals is bad?
[00:54:54.229 --> 00:54:54.690]  No!
[00:54:54.690 --> 00:54:55.410]  You're bad!
[00:54:55.410 --> 00:54:56.130]  You're a liar!
[00:54:56.130 --> 00:54:56.911]  You're a scum!
[00:54:56.911 --> 00:55:01.933]  You say a Pfizer deadly shot making me attack my own body is good, you little maggot!
[00:55:03.160 --> 00:55:08.882]  And then you say I'm bad selling something that's life-giving.
[00:55:08.882 --> 00:55:11.282]  Burn in hell.
[00:55:11.282 --> 00:55:13.043]  Go research what's in our new product.
[00:55:13.043 --> 00:55:25.627]  30% off greens fiber capsules at InfoWarsTore.com InfoWarsTore.com There you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:55:25.627 --> 00:55:26.887]  And that funds this operation.
[00:55:26.887 --> 00:55:28.808]  Please support our local stations.
[00:55:28.808 --> 00:55:30.468]  And look, if I seem pissed off, I am.
[00:55:30.468 --> 00:55:32.809]  We should be upset about what's going on.
[00:55:33.729 --> 00:55:36.597]  I haven't even hit any of these damn articles that piss me off so much.
[00:55:36.597 --> 00:55:38.182]  And all these video clips.
[00:55:38.182 --> 00:55:38.944]  And your phone calls.
[00:55:38.944 --> 00:55:39.907]  Look at the number up.
[00:55:39.907 --> 00:55:41.231]  Hour number two's coming up!
[00:55:46.471 --> 00:55:50.254]  Alex Jones here with two big announcements in the next 60 seconds.
[00:55:50.254 --> 00:55:52.735]  First off, green fiber capsules.
[00:55:52.735 --> 00:55:57.598]  Highest quality fiber you're going to find with all the amino acids and a ton of vitamins and minerals.
[00:55:57.598 --> 00:55:59.079]  This is an incredible formula.
[00:55:59.079 --> 00:56:00.500]  Everybody should be taking it.
[00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:02.701]  Men, women, children, old, young, black, white.
[00:56:02.701 --> 00:56:03.342]  It doesn't matter.
[00:56:03.342 --> 00:56:04.623]  It's an amazing product.
[00:56:04.623 --> 00:56:05.803]  It's our newest product.
[00:56:05.803 --> 00:56:08.025]  It's 50% off out of the gates.
[00:56:08.025 --> 00:56:09.085]  MFoneWorkstore.com.
[00:56:09.085 --> 00:56:10.626]  Then we have both types of X2.
[00:56:10.626 --> 00:56:13.908]  It's the exact same X2 in the bottle, but one has a spray cap.
[00:56:13.908 --> 00:56:14.709]  One has a dropper cap.
[00:56:14.969 --> 00:56:19.832]  For 60% and 40% off, depending on which one, they're both excellent at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:56:19.832 --> 00:56:27.557]  The 60% off of the spray bottle is unprecedented, but I want you to experience the power of the good halogen and learn about the iodine conspiracy.
[00:56:27.557 --> 00:56:29.838]  It's all available at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:56:29.838 --> 00:56:38.183]  The new green fiber capsules, 50% off, and X2 in the spray bottle and in the dropper bottle for 60% and 40% off.
[00:56:38.183 --> 00:56:39.624]  And it funds the InfoWare.
[00:56:39.624 --> 00:56:44.587]  Experience Deep Earth Crystal Iodine for itself and keep your gut healthy at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:56:49.580 --> 00:56:52.970]  What are champions made of?
[00:56:52.970 --> 00:56:54.113]  Here's a man who can show you.
[00:57:00.638 --> 00:57:02.199]  AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[00:57:02.199 --> 00:57:04.140]  AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[00:57:04.140 --> 00:57:05.580]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[00:57:05.580 --> 00:57:06.801]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[00:57:06.801 --> 00:57:07.901]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[00:57:07.901 --> 00:57:09.442]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[00:57:26.890 --> 00:57:30.353]  InfowarsStore.com is simply the best.
[00:57:30.353 --> 00:57:33.396]  InfowarsStore.com beats out all the rest.
[00:57:33.396 --> 00:57:35.618]  888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139 is the Infowars Store hotline.
[00:57:35.618 --> 00:57:36.879]  888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, that's InfowarsStore.com.
[00:57:36.879 --> 00:57:38.140]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:58:02.452 --> 00:58:03.092]  We're good to go.
[00:58:25.784 --> 00:58:37.993]  Here's a little bit of German TV on the 70 plus dead, and that's a low number, and the bedlam in South Africa, and all the great reset destabilization that's not coming, it's already here, here it is.
[00:58:37.993 --> 00:58:45.858]  Authorities in South Africa say that more than 70 people have been killed in some of the worst violence the country has seen in years.
[00:58:45.858 --> 00:58:51.242]  Stores and warehouses across the country have been looted, and more than a thousand people have been arrested.
[00:58:52.020 --> 00:59:02.244]  The unrest erupted last week after former President Jacob Zuma began serving a prison sentence for contempt of court.
[00:59:02.244 --> 00:59:07.626]  This warehouse in Durban was ransacked by hundreds of people.
[00:59:07.626 --> 00:59:09.647]  The shelves emptied.
[00:59:09.647 --> 00:59:13.829]  The goods carried out in bulk.
[00:59:13.829 --> 00:59:19.731]  It is only one of dozens of malls, supermarkets and small shops that were targeted by looters.
[00:59:21.090 --> 00:59:24.572]  Like this party supplies shop in Soweto.
[00:59:24.572 --> 00:59:26.794]  It's over.
[00:59:26.794 --> 00:59:26.994]  It's over.
[00:59:26.994 --> 00:59:29.495]  I've got overhead.
[00:59:29.495 --> 00:59:32.357]  I owe banks money.
[00:59:32.357 --> 00:59:34.318]  How am I going to pay this money?
[00:59:34.318 --> 00:59:36.360]  With what?
[00:59:36.360 --> 00:59:43.464]  In some instances, armed local residents went after the looters themselves.
[00:59:43.464 --> 00:59:49.148]  The government sent soldiers to the most affected areas as police struggled to control the unrest.
[00:59:52.370 --> 01:00:02.192]  The current situation on the ground is under strong surveillance and we will ensure that it does not deteriorate any further.
[01:00:02.192 --> 01:00:08.213]  We cannot allow anyone to make a mockery of our democratic state.
[01:00:08.213 --> 01:00:15.775]  The protest started last week after former South African President Jacob Zuma began serving a 15-month jail term.
[01:00:15.775 --> 01:00:20.696]  He was sentenced for contempt of court after refusing to appear at a corruption inquiry.
[01:00:22.555 --> 01:00:33.204]  The outrage of Zuma supporters was compounded by anger over persisting inequality and poverty in the country.
[01:00:33.204 --> 01:00:38.088]  And for more, let's cross over to DW correspondent Christine Mundwa, who's standing by in Cape Town.
[01:00:38.088 --> 01:00:40.730]  Christine, what is the current situation in the country right now?
[01:00:44.688 --> 01:00:46.949]  Sarah, the looting continues.
[01:00:46.949 --> 01:00:49.670]  Overnight, more buildings were set alight.
[01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:53.391]  We know that the number of people arrested is well over 1,000.
[01:00:53.391 --> 01:01:02.294]  And we are receiving warnings now of looming food shortages because of the disruptions in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng.
[01:01:02.294 --> 01:01:06.395]  These are key provinces when it comes to the supply of goods into the country.
[01:01:06.955 --> 01:01:11.479]  In many sites in these provinces, vaccine rollout has been affected.
[01:01:11.479 --> 01:01:17.765]  That is going to obviously have an impact on what already was a slow rollout of the vaccine here in South Africa.
[01:01:17.765 --> 01:01:24.971]  There is also concern about racial tensions flaring up now because of the lack of visibility when it comes to law enforcement.
[01:01:24.971 --> 01:01:26.913]  You now have armed citizens
[01:01:27.493 --> 01:01:32.115]  Defending their property, and in many cases it is fueling some racial tensions.
[01:01:32.115 --> 01:01:41.780]  People are also worried here about the outbreak of xenophobic violence, because all sorts of criminality have now emerged from this violence and looting, Sarah.
[01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:49.524]  Okay, so we're seeing criminality, but I mean, you know, by and large, Christine, who are these people that we're seeing, for example, looting?
[01:01:53.712 --> 01:01:57.773]  Sarah, the people you'll see looting are underprivileged South Africans for the most part.
[01:01:57.773 --> 01:02:06.395]  These are people who live in informal settlements, who have been pushed further into poverty because of the pandemic and the restrictions that have come with it.
[01:02:06.395 --> 01:02:13.056]  And so, what you're hearing from the officials in this country is that these people, their poverty is being exploited.
[01:02:13.056 --> 01:02:17.957]  In fact, those are the words of a senior ruling party official, that the poverty of people was being exploited.
[01:02:18.397 --> 01:02:26.665]  But what authorities are now investigating is that these crowds, these mobs, are being stoked and prompted by a more sinister third force.
[01:02:26.665 --> 01:02:39.516]  Because among the looters, among the people going in and stealing basic items like food and clothing, you have people lighting things up and setting things on fire who seem to want to be making destruction.
[01:02:39.516 --> 01:02:44.601]  And so these people are being investigated because it is believed, or at least reports have emerged,
[01:02:45.141 --> 01:02:49.425]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone from beta testing to operational.
[01:03:02.742 --> 01:03:08.265]  The globalists are out in the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot takeover.
[01:03:08.265 --> 01:03:16.110]  But the good news is we've been working, and you've been working, and others have been working across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to fight it off.
[01:03:16.110 --> 01:03:17.591]  Humanity is strong.
[01:03:17.591 --> 01:03:18.552]  We're incredible.
[01:03:18.552 --> 01:03:22.334]  And if we're aware of the attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating it.
[01:03:22.334 --> 01:03:24.795]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[01:03:24.795 --> 01:03:30.739]  So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential, and warning others is absolutely essential.
[01:03:31.119 --> 01:03:40.783]  At the same time, supporting InfoWars by buying high quality products to keep us on air is essential, because they're great products for you and your family, and they're also funding our operation.
[01:03:40.783 --> 01:03:43.104]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:03:43.104 --> 01:03:45.766]  InfoWarsStore.com is incredible.
[01:03:45.766 --> 01:03:51.088]  A lot of our products that have been sold out because of supply chain breakdowns are back in, like bodies, bazzo beats, and others.
[01:03:51.088 --> 01:03:55.070]  So get them today at InfoWarsStore.com, and I thank you for being part of the resistance.
[01:03:56.579 --> 01:03:57.180]  We've got it.
[01:03:57.180 --> 01:04:03.705]  This transmission is coming to you.
[01:04:03.705 --> 01:04:05.826]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:04:05.826 --> 01:04:06.707]  Alejandro!
[01:04:06.707 --> 01:04:07.888]  Alright, here I go.
[01:04:07.888 --> 01:04:14.693]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[01:04:14.693 --> 01:04:24.021]  Alejandro Mayorkas, the head of the Department of Homeland Security, who's oversaw the puppet president, the dictator, the pretender,
[01:04:25.581 --> 01:04:43.367]  In the last seven months, looting and destroying our country and letting massive numbers, hundreds of thousands of smuggled children and millions of people total, he came out yesterday with an announcement that got almost no attention, but now the State Department has confirmed it, the DHS has confirmed it.
[01:04:43.367 --> 01:04:51.410]  If you're in Cuba, the national communist regime that puts you in jail for five years for protesting and will execute you if you do it a second time,
[01:04:53.220 --> 01:04:56.322]  Statue of Liberty isn't for you!
[01:04:56.322 --> 01:04:59.283]  You're actually a political dissident!
[01:04:59.283 --> 01:05:06.047]  You are not welcome here in America because you're right-wingers that have experienced that communism is a bad thing.
[01:05:06.047 --> 01:05:10.850]  Biden's DHS chief warned Cuban and Asian migrants not to come to the U.S.
[01:05:10.850 --> 01:05:15.092]  If you take the C, you will not come.
[01:05:15.092 --> 01:05:16.913]  And so here is a clip.
[01:05:18.348 --> 01:05:25.014]  Particularly, he didn't say this earlier to Haiti, he's saying this now to the Cubans that are 90 miles away, to 70 miles from the Keys.
[01:05:25.014 --> 01:05:26.075]  Do not come!
[01:05:26.075 --> 01:05:29.898]  Because you're really a political dissident, and we don't want you here.
[01:05:29.898 --> 01:05:33.861]  We love Fidel Castro.
[01:05:33.861 --> 01:05:36.924]  To be clear, if you take to the sea,
[01:05:37.973 --> 01:05:38.153]  Oh, but...
[01:06:03.135 --> 01:06:13.341]  All the boats coming in from other places are fine, and normal Haitian boats are fine, and Mexican boats are fine, just not Cuban boats, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:06:13.341 --> 01:06:17.384]  Just like it came out that polls that try to come to the U.S.
[01:06:17.384 --> 01:06:19.025]  are like 75% Republican.
[01:06:19.025 --> 01:06:32.013]  So suddenly the Democrats, oh no, no, no, if you're Polish, you can't come here because of your, not the color of your skin, your political proclivity.
[01:06:32.013 --> 01:06:32.533]  What you're for.
[01:06:34.281 --> 01:06:37.542]  So it never ends, ladies and gentlemen, and they want to put us under the exact same thing.
[01:06:37.542 --> 01:06:39.583]  So here's the deal.
[01:06:39.583 --> 01:06:45.686]  I want to open the phones up here on a host of issues, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:06:45.686 --> 01:06:55.470]  I want to open the phones up on a string of issues.
[01:06:55.470 --> 01:06:57.431]  But I want to talk about those specifically.
[01:06:57.431 --> 01:06:58.051]  What do you make
[01:06:59.071 --> 01:07:10.298]  Of Biden preparing emergency quarantine centers, saying all these deadly variants are there, heating up all the same propaganda, saying a lockdown is going to be announced in the fall.
[01:07:10.298 --> 01:07:13.359]  I've got their statements here, I'm going to cover it.
[01:07:13.359 --> 01:07:24.806]  And CDC operational considerations for community isolation centers for COVID-19 and all the documents
[01:07:25.723 --> 01:07:41.493]  That deal with that and the fact that they're coming to your houses, they're knocking on your doors, they're trying to identify who's been injected, who hasn't, even though they admit the vaccine doesn't protect you and now they want a new booster shot because it didn't work six months in.
[01:07:41.493 --> 01:07:44.755]  What an incredible fraud we've gotten caught in.
[01:07:44.755 --> 01:07:48.738]  And now, the next level of censorship.
[01:07:48.738 --> 01:07:51.540]  Twitter disables likes on misleading tweets.
[01:07:54.076 --> 01:08:05.585]  Evolutionary biologist, the one that's been banned, the one that went on Joe Rogan, was simply retweeting people saying, I don't want COVID-19 passports.
[01:08:05.585 --> 01:08:08.727]  I don't want this world ID.
[01:08:08.727 --> 01:08:10.649]  That's scientific disinfo.
[01:08:10.649 --> 01:08:15.793]  Not wanting Klaus Schwab's UN global social credit score controlling system.
[01:08:15.793 --> 01:08:18.074]  Not wanting the vaccine passport.
[01:08:18.074 --> 01:08:19.455]  That's not allowed.
[01:08:19.455 --> 01:08:20.016]  They said it.
[01:08:20.016 --> 01:08:20.876]  Twitter said.
[01:08:20.876 --> 01:08:22.798]  We've got shots of the screenshots.
[01:08:24.733 --> 01:08:27.775]  You're not allowed to not want this!
[01:08:27.775 --> 01:08:31.257]  Political repression just like you see in Cuba or North Korea.
[01:08:31.257 --> 01:08:32.157]  Next level censorship.
[01:08:32.157 --> 01:08:35.699]  Twitter disables likes on misleading tweets.
[01:08:35.699 --> 01:08:47.125]  A message shared by the managing director of the field capital, Eric Weinstein, shows Twitter is blocking users from interacting with tweets deemed misleading.
[01:08:47.125 --> 01:08:47.926]  They go on to say,
[01:08:48.795 --> 01:08:57.220]  The tweets, evidently, the original offending tweet was merely someone relating their opinion on vaccine passports and vaccine lockdowns.
[01:08:57.220 --> 01:09:01.903]  Well, you don't do that!
[01:09:01.903 --> 01:09:03.424]  You see why I get so pissed?
[01:09:03.424 --> 01:09:06.506]  Because at home last night, today, and here, I read all this stuff.
[01:09:06.506 --> 01:09:09.047]  Like, I don't just have these articles out here to impress you with a number of them.
[01:09:09.047 --> 01:09:11.889]  I mean, we open these up, I've got them all read.
[01:09:11.889 --> 01:09:14.391]  That's why I'm so pissed!
[01:09:14.391 --> 01:09:16.192]  Watching in slow motion the takeover.
[01:09:16.192 --> 01:09:16.612]  Look at this one.
[01:09:17.981 --> 01:09:24.445]  Father warns the world 70-year-old son diagnosed with heart condition after COVID required vaccine.
[01:09:24.445 --> 01:09:26.026]  Not a vaccine.
[01:09:26.026 --> 01:09:31.649]  Democrat group plans to fact-check private SMS messages or text messages.
[01:09:31.649 --> 01:09:33.590]  Remember, that was just yesterday's news.
[01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:38.853]  British government will have to force people to eat less red meat to save us from climate change.
[01:09:38.853 --> 01:09:40.794]  Oh, I thought they said that wasn't true.
[01:09:40.794 --> 01:09:45.957]  John McAfee's wife claims Spanish authorities are overseeing a cover-up of his death.
[01:09:49.446 --> 01:09:52.570]  Cover up of his death.
[01:09:52.570 --> 01:09:55.593]  And when we come back from break, I'm going to give the number out right now.
[01:09:55.593 --> 01:09:57.895]  We got the video for you.
[01:09:57.895 --> 01:10:00.058]  It has begun.
[01:10:00.058 --> 01:10:05.864]  Door-to-door vaccine pushers hit the streets.
[01:10:05.864 --> 01:10:07.186]  And what is the answer to that, Will?
[01:10:08.869 --> 01:10:18.443]  Cover it all, but whatever you see in Spain, or in Australia, or in the UK, or in Canada, or in France, is the UN.
[01:10:18.443 --> 01:10:19.744]  Same policies.
[01:10:19.744 --> 01:10:21.066]  That's why yesterday the UK
[01:10:24.361 --> 01:10:33.263]  Greece and France all announced mandatory COVID-19 passports when they always promised, oh, that'll never happen.
[01:10:33.263 --> 01:10:35.443]  Don't form any opposition to us.
[01:10:35.443 --> 01:10:36.424]  It'll never happen.
[01:10:36.424 --> 01:10:40.525]  Let us gaslight, gaslight, gaslight, gaslight, gaslight.
[01:10:40.525 --> 01:10:41.485]  None of that's happening.
[01:10:41.485 --> 01:10:42.485]  None of that's going on.
[01:10:42.485 --> 01:10:43.545]  Go back to sleep.
[01:10:43.545 --> 01:10:44.265]  No, no, no, no.
[01:10:44.265 --> 01:10:45.526]  And then, oh yeah, here it is!
[01:10:45.526 --> 01:10:46.486]  Ha ha ha!
[01:10:52.495 --> 01:10:59.338]  The toll-free number to join us on... Everybody else can come here who isn't political dissidents.
[01:10:59.338 --> 01:11:00.899]  We'll pay for everything for you.
[01:11:00.899 --> 01:11:02.320]  But if you're Cuban, you can't come here.
[01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:03.740]  What's your take on that?
[01:11:03.740 --> 01:11:14.345]  What's your take on, oh yeah, we want another lockdown and we've got emergency quarantine centers ready and all the federal training documents, how they're preparing to lock up your towns and lock down your cities and not let you get in your cars.
[01:11:14.345 --> 01:11:15.966]  We just had the training wheels before!
[01:11:17.501 --> 01:11:21.502]  And see, the psychology is, well, put up with it, they'll take it off next time.
[01:11:21.502 --> 01:11:22.783]  But see, they don't take it off.
[01:11:22.783 --> 01:11:26.024]  Or maybe they partially take it off the next time, and then the next time don't.
[01:11:26.024 --> 01:11:27.404]  See the psychological training?
[01:11:27.404 --> 01:11:29.405]  Get it?
[01:11:29.405 --> 01:11:31.026]  Get it?
[01:11:31.026 --> 01:11:35.027]  Better get involved, better get aggressive, better prepare, because it's on.
[01:11:36.288 --> 01:11:36.428]  877-789-2539.
[01:11:36.428 --> 01:11:37.108]  First-time callers, 877-789-2539.
[01:11:37.108 --> 01:11:37.188]  877-789-2539.
[01:11:37.188 --> 01:11:37.388]  Alex, 877-789-2539.
[01:11:37.388 --> 01:11:39.749]  Now, right now, let's talk about what we can do with our own bodies.
[01:11:39.749 --> 01:11:45.670]  Let's talk about what we can do with our own bodies with things that God has given us in this crazy world and all the things that Globalists are doing.
[01:12:04.887 --> 01:12:31.554]  We've sought out to not just give you the most hardcore info and unfiltered with savage human energy to activate the resistance, but we bring you the products that do that as well, that don't just help your body, but you know, fund an operation you can see with your own eyeballs, who is creating the counter-narrative and the talking points against the entire satanic Great Reset New World Order abomination.
[01:12:31.554 --> 01:12:33.975]  All glory goes to Christ!
[01:12:33.975 --> 01:12:34.495]  We've got
[01:12:35.436 --> 01:12:40.559]  Green fiber capsules, and the name fiber is great, we named it that, but fiber is the side issue.
[01:12:40.559 --> 01:12:52.545]  This is an amino acid, all the essential amino acids and more, a bunch of vitamins and minerals in organic, natural form, concentrated, one of the best natural green formulas you're going to find.
[01:12:52.545 --> 01:12:53.786]  Is it the best in the world?
[01:12:53.786 --> 01:12:54.326]  I don't know.
[01:12:54.326 --> 01:12:56.667]  I know it's super high-end.
[01:12:56.667 --> 01:12:58.068]  I'm not omnipresent like God.
[01:12:59.685 --> 01:13:04.129]  But I know I could have put this out for eight times less than I put it out.
[01:13:04.129 --> 01:13:20.285]  I know that I went and found a top producer that would put us out what they believed is the strongest concentrated amino acid vitamin mineral supercharge from not just wheatgrass, but a bunch of other sprouts.
[01:13:20.285 --> 01:13:24.189]  This isn't a bunch of concentrated ground up cabbage that still flushes your guts out and is great.
[01:13:25.211 --> 01:13:29.633]  This is all of these amazing products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:13:29.633 --> 01:13:31.934]  It's 50% off, it's our new product.

[01:13:40.218 --> 01:13:43.600]  And it's gonna sell out, but I gotta get the funding in, so it doesn't matter.
[01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:45.061]  We're gonna finish the race here.
[01:13:45.061 --> 01:13:49.963]  So we're selling stuff, some of it at cost, like this X2, because I gotta get the funds in now.
[01:13:49.963 --> 01:13:51.404]  Take advantage of it, take action.
[01:13:57.122 --> 01:13:59.204]  Your voice counts.
[01:13:59.204 --> 01:14:04.269]  When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes the world.
[01:14:04.269 --> 01:14:06.851]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[01:14:06.851 --> 01:14:08.352]  They know you're angry.
[01:14:08.352 --> 01:14:13.757]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.

[01:14:54.674 --> 01:14:58.557]  Experts agree that getting proper sleep is the cornerstone of good health.
[01:14:58.557 --> 01:15:09.165]  It has been proven that a poor sleep schedule is linked with numerous health problems, including weight gain, memory issues, mood changes, poor concentration, and even a weakened immune system.
[01:15:09.165 --> 01:15:15.369]  Introducing RocketRest, the new product from our Dr. Jones Naturals line at InfowarsStore.com.

[01:15:53.976 --> 01:15:56.437]  The world is awakening.
[01:15:56.437 --> 01:15:59.938]  The world is beginning to understand the globalist paradigm.
[01:15:59.938 --> 01:16:11.242]  They are discovering the globalists, the elites, the manipulation, the CFR, the Trilateral Commission, the Bilderberg Group, the Bohemian Grove, the Club of Rome.
[01:16:11.242 --> 01:16:21.025]  And so, even though it seems like the globalists are winning, the truth is, they've had to come out in the open to attack human freedom because they're actually losing.
[01:16:21.025 --> 01:16:23.526]  We have forced them out in the open.
[01:16:24.145 --> 01:16:29.989]  So as bad as these times are, and a lot of negative things are about to happen, realize humanity is winning.
[01:16:29.989 --> 01:16:35.012]  You've got to trust in the plan of God, and trust in the plan of God's justice.
[01:16:35.012 --> 01:16:36.453]  That is invincible.
[01:16:36.453 --> 01:16:39.875]  That is ethereal, timeless, and unstoppable.
[01:16:39.875 --> 01:16:45.618]  So don't trust in man, trust in God, to lead God and direct your soul, and then take action against the globalists.
[01:16:45.618 --> 01:16:49.681]  And realize, you've got my commitment from Alex Jones and my crew to you.
[01:16:49.681 --> 01:16:53.483]  We will never back down from the globalists, and we will never surrender.
[01:16:57.342 --> 01:16:59.969]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:17:16.252 --> 01:17:19.774]  County Health Department trying to ramp up COVID vaccinations.
[01:17:19.774 --> 01:17:22.736]  Health leaders kicking off a new initiative today.
[01:17:22.736 --> 01:17:28.040]  It's called Doses to Doors program, and it makes getting a vaccine virtually effortless.
[01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:34.845]  Community outreach groups have been canvassing specific neighborhoods for a few months now, educating and encouraging people to get the shot.
[01:17:34.845 --> 01:17:36.606]  Today it got a lot easier.
[01:17:36.606 --> 01:17:40.088]  Health department workers were giving the shot on the spot.
[01:17:40.088 --> 01:17:42.830]  WCNC Charlotte's Chloe Leshner is live in West Charlotte.
[01:17:42.830 --> 01:17:44.411]  Chloe, does this canvassing work?
[01:17:46.303 --> 01:17:49.986]  Fred, the county thinks it does, which is why they are expanding this program.
[01:17:49.986 --> 01:17:58.273]  Action NC has knocked on 35,000 doors since May, and up until today, their only goal was to listen and dispel false information.
[01:17:58.273 --> 01:18:02.316]  But a lot of times, they are able to encourage people to get vaccinated.
[01:18:02.316 --> 01:18:04.598]  So now they can guarantee that it gets done.
[01:18:06.903 --> 01:18:11.444]  We reminded folks about the COVID-19 vaccination.
[01:18:11.444 --> 01:18:12.985]  It's public health at work.
[01:18:12.985 --> 01:18:15.326]  Community outreach groups going door-to-door.
[01:18:15.326 --> 01:18:16.446]  Have you had yours yet?
[01:18:16.446 --> 01:18:19.487]  To have personal conversations about the COVID vaccine.
[01:18:19.487 --> 01:18:22.508]  We get people that will say, yes, I'll get the shot.
[01:18:23.078 --> 01:18:25.119]  But the follow-up has always been the issue.
[01:18:25.119 --> 01:18:25.739]  Will they go?
[01:18:25.739 --> 01:18:28.481]  You know, how can we get people to go out and go?
[01:18:28.481 --> 01:18:32.643]  Now the health department is close by so they can offer the shots on demand.
[01:18:32.643 --> 01:18:37.165]  Now that the health department is actually coming out with us, we missed that middle step now.
[01:18:37.165 --> 01:18:39.687]  So now we... Would you like to get a shot?
[01:18:39.687 --> 01:18:39.907]  Yes.
[01:18:40.507 --> 01:18:42.367]  We've got somebody right here on site.
[01:18:42.367 --> 01:18:50.889]  In the first few hours of the new Doses to Doors program, four people in this West Charlotte neighborhood decided to get the shot right on their front porch.
[01:18:50.889 --> 01:18:52.470]  That eliminates any excuse.
[01:18:52.470 --> 01:18:54.890]  You don't have to drive anywhere and sit in line.
[01:18:54.890 --> 01:18:56.031]  You don't have to have a vehicle.
[01:18:56.031 --> 01:18:57.291]  You don't need to Uber.
[01:18:57.291 --> 01:18:58.531]  They are right here.
[01:18:58.531 --> 01:19:07.033]  The county primarily focused on neighborhoods with lower vaccination rates and communities that are hesitant but have also been disproportionately impacted by COVID.
[01:19:07.153 --> 01:19:18.458]  You'll see the majority of the crew is African-American or Latinx because it's hard for people to find commonality as a subject if they don't see themselves in it.
[01:19:21.661 --> 01:19:24.543]  An important note, they're really not being forceful at all.
[01:19:24.543 --> 01:19:28.727]  The health department only comes up if the person says that they want the shot.
[01:19:28.727 --> 01:19:32.330]  And we did see a handful of people today say they still weren't interested.
[01:19:32.330 --> 01:19:36.373]  So those volunteers really just working to understand why that is.
[01:19:36.373 --> 01:19:40.937]  But coming up at 6, we will hear from somebody who did get vaccinated here today.
[01:19:40.937 --> 01:19:44.600]  For now, live in Charlotte, Chloe Leshner, WCNC Charlotte.
[01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:50.364]  Oh yeah, a little bit south there, they shot the black folks up with syphilis.
[01:19:50.364 --> 01:19:51.245]  And you know, I get it.
[01:19:51.815 --> 01:19:52.655]  They've made people poor.
[01:19:52.655 --> 01:19:53.296]  They've done them down.
[01:19:53.296 --> 01:19:56.997]  Why don't we just go ahead and kill them?
[01:19:56.997 --> 01:19:58.778]  I don't care if they're poor black people, poor white people.
[01:19:58.778 --> 01:20:01.940]  I'm not going to sit around and do this to them.
[01:20:01.940 --> 01:20:09.643]  And you get all these useful idiots, like the black anchorman, the cute, you know, trendy girl in the green dress.
[01:20:09.643 --> 01:20:10.744]  Oh, trust us.
[01:20:10.744 --> 01:20:20.008]  Oh, look, we got black people and Latina girls here to give you this shot made by Bill Gates in some factory that they won't even tell you what the ingredients are that's super secret.
[01:20:20.874 --> 01:20:24.776]  Then we get the ingredients, it's the entire jellyfish genome?
[01:20:24.776 --> 01:20:26.057]  And then a dead kid from 1966?
[01:20:26.057 --> 01:20:31.840]  We go, hey, hey, uh, top scientists say this will attack your own body.
[01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:33.321]  It attacks the protein.
[01:20:33.321 --> 01:20:35.802]  Oh, shut up!
[01:20:35.802 --> 01:20:37.123]  Shut up.
[01:20:37.123 --> 01:20:37.944]  Oh, you heard them.
[01:20:37.944 --> 01:20:40.705]  They said they're not being forceful at all.
[01:20:40.705 --> 01:20:48.950]  Well, I just showed Kathleen Sebelius, the head of Health and Human Services under Obama, saying you shouldn't be able to have a job or your children, or children.
[01:20:49.986 --> 01:20:53.710]  God, you don't get money and you don't have your children.
[01:20:53.710 --> 01:20:57.133]  Boy, that sounds pretty damn bad.
[01:20:57.133 --> 01:20:58.715]  Most folks commit suicide in that.
[01:20:58.715 --> 01:20:59.876]  But that's not forceful.
[01:20:59.876 --> 01:21:00.616]  I mean, you heard them.
[01:21:00.616 --> 01:21:01.958]  Oh, this isn't forceful at all.
[01:21:01.958 --> 01:21:08.184]  No, it's not forceful when they gave that little black kid in a photo.
[01:21:08.184 --> 01:21:08.624]  Where was that?
[01:21:08.624 --> 01:21:09.325]  Tanzania.
[01:21:10.723 --> 01:21:13.686]  They gave him live polio.
[01:21:13.686 --> 01:21:15.647]  How about you're paralyzed until your ass dies?
[01:21:15.647 --> 01:21:16.668]  That's pretty little.
[01:21:16.668 --> 01:21:19.471]  Look though, it's a black lady doing it, so it's alright.
[01:21:19.471 --> 01:21:21.993]  Hey look, a black lady came from Bill Gates.
[01:21:21.993 --> 01:21:22.954]  Hey, pull it up!
[01:21:22.954 --> 01:21:26.317]  Most polio caused by Bill Gates funded polio program.
[01:21:26.317 --> 01:21:27.478]  Reuters, that's the headline.
[01:21:27.478 --> 01:21:29.660]  Most polio cases, AP too.
[01:21:29.660 --> 01:21:32.643]  Most polio cases caused by Bill Gates.
[01:21:32.643 --> 01:21:32.883]  Wow!
[01:21:34.591 --> 01:21:36.453]  Oh, oh, oh, but I'm sorry.
[01:21:36.453 --> 01:21:39.535]  There's nothing forceful going on anywhere, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:21:39.535 --> 01:21:40.456]  There's nothing going on.
[01:21:40.456 --> 01:21:41.297]  Look at this right here!
[01:21:41.297 --> 01:21:44.360]  Want me to play the video for you?
[01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:50.125]  Macron announces those without COVID vaccine passes will be banned from routine life activities.
[01:21:50.125 --> 01:21:51.146]  Close quote.
[01:21:51.146 --> 01:21:52.787]  I mean, there's nothing forceful here.
[01:21:52.787 --> 01:21:56.450]  Oh, thank God we're not making these people do anything.
[01:21:56.450 --> 01:21:57.291]  I mean, you know.
[01:22:04.693 --> 01:22:06.153]  Yeah, that's a good headline for the Guardian.
[01:22:06.153 --> 01:22:07.514]  You guys pulled one up last week.
[01:22:07.514 --> 01:22:08.674]  I hadn't even seen it from like AP.
[01:22:08.674 --> 01:22:09.774]  I had Reuters.
[01:22:09.774 --> 01:22:13.195]  I was telling Joe Rogan when I was on the show back in October of last year.
[01:22:13.195 --> 01:22:14.895]  I want to get back on soon.
[01:22:14.895 --> 01:22:20.217]  And I'm sitting there and I'm like, yeah, you know, the majority of polio the last decade was caused by Bill Gates' vaccine.
[01:22:20.217 --> 01:22:21.797]  And they're, oh, really?
[01:22:21.797 --> 01:22:22.897]  Let's fact check that.
[01:22:22.897 --> 01:22:24.358]  And Joe knows I don't make stuff up.
[01:22:24.358 --> 01:22:25.798]  So they search engine it.
[01:22:25.798 --> 01:22:28.198]  And it was it was it was Reuters.
[01:22:28.198 --> 01:22:30.599]  Gates vaccine causes majority of polio.
[01:22:32.111 --> 01:22:36.057]  Or polio, UN-backed polio vaccine causing the majority of polio.
[01:22:36.057 --> 01:22:38.219]  But they even found an AP headline last week.
[01:22:38.219 --> 01:22:39.141]  There it is.
[01:22:39.141 --> 01:22:44.228]  UN says new polio outbreak in Sudan caused by oral vaccine.
[01:22:44.228 --> 01:22:44.288]  Oh!
[01:22:47.442 --> 01:22:55.131]  Oh, but I'm a white supremacist, all those big black podcasters funded by YouTube and Google and Apple.
[01:22:55.131 --> 01:22:59.196]  Why, they all sit up there every day with a talking point that I'm a white supremacist.
[01:22:59.196 --> 01:23:00.958]  Yeah, I'm a real white supremacist.
[01:23:00.958 --> 01:23:05.183]  Oh my God, that's why I don't want them killing black people.
[01:23:05.183 --> 01:23:07.366]  Because you know, it's God's job who's going to get killed.
[01:23:07.950 --> 01:23:12.371]  Okay, maybe Africa gets a giant population, the UN opens them up, brings them in here, and they kill me.
[01:23:12.371 --> 01:23:13.071]  It's okay.
[01:23:13.071 --> 01:23:14.672]  I'm not killing little black kids.
[01:23:14.672 --> 01:23:15.932]  I'm not killing little white kids.
[01:23:15.932 --> 01:23:20.273]  I'm not deciding that I'm going to kill a bunch of people because they might do something bad to me.
[01:23:20.273 --> 01:23:20.373]  See?
[01:23:20.373 --> 01:23:23.614]  And it's not because I'm a goody two-shoes, folks.
[01:23:23.614 --> 01:23:33.637]  When I even think about Bill Gates and them making the decision to do this, while they wrap themselves, oh, where black lives matter, Bill Gates gave 50 million to him.
[01:23:33.637 --> 01:23:34.877]  And these statements like,
[01:23:36.832 --> 01:23:43.577]  We need to call Africans.
[01:23:43.577 --> 01:23:47.700]  And all these pimp black men that sit up there.
[01:23:47.700 --> 01:23:49.202]  They're the ones getting pimped by the system.
[01:23:49.202 --> 01:23:50.242]  I think they're the pimp.
[01:23:50.242 --> 01:23:53.885]  They sit up there like button and all them and call me a racist.
[01:23:53.885 --> 01:23:55.586]  Yeah, sure, man.
[01:23:55.586 --> 01:24:00.030]  You're going to have to face God button and every other damn person.
[01:24:00.030 --> 01:24:06.455]  I don't care what color you are when you sit there and you push this crap.
[01:24:06.455 --> 01:24:06.535]  Oh,
[01:24:07.446 --> 01:24:07.966]  You heard him.
[01:24:07.966 --> 01:24:09.387]  Oh, nobody's pressuring you.
[01:24:09.387 --> 01:24:14.270]  We just heard the Health and Human Secretary head say you shouldn't even have a job or children.
[01:24:14.270 --> 01:24:15.270]  Here, let's another one.
[01:24:15.270 --> 01:24:21.894]  Sebelius, unvaccinated Americans should not be allowed to work or have children.
[01:24:21.894 --> 01:24:28.478]  Obama official, you should lose your job if you don't take experimental gene therapy vaccine.
[01:24:28.478 --> 01:24:34.421]  CBS anchor brags to Fauci, she's banning unvaccinated family members from Thanksgiving!
[01:24:36.474 --> 01:24:40.896]  Well, I don't want to go to your damn Thanksgiving, you demon woman!
[01:24:40.896 --> 01:24:49.939]  WHO epidemiologist says it was disgusting, it was devastating to see fans enjoying Euros finally unmasked.
[01:24:49.939 --> 01:24:55.101]  Look at all those weird-ass humans sharing all their bugs, getting healthier.
[01:24:55.101 --> 01:25:01.164]  Every study actually shows when you get a couple hundred thousand people live together, they all share each other's DNA.
[01:25:02.498 --> 01:25:04.540]  We all commune, that's why we like to go.
[01:25:04.540 --> 01:25:07.864]  It's not about the game, it's about we all get together!
[01:25:07.864 --> 01:25:09.645]  And they don't like that, do they?
[01:25:09.645 --> 01:25:14.791]  And they got all these damn rappers about, yeah, back that ass up!
[01:25:14.791 --> 01:25:17.033]  And now the new song is, back that vax up!
[01:25:17.961 --> 01:25:22.122]  He's like, baby, I'll have sex with you, but he's not throwing money out anymore, $100 bills.
[01:25:22.122 --> 01:25:23.202]  He's throwing VASCAR.
[01:25:23.202 --> 01:25:24.823]  Here, baby, I'll give you a blood clot.
[01:25:24.823 --> 01:25:26.063]  I'll give you brain cancer.
[01:25:26.063 --> 01:25:27.183]  I'll give you a heart attack.
[01:25:27.183 --> 01:25:29.404]  I'll give you a stillborn baby.
[01:25:29.404 --> 01:25:30.244]  I'm black, though.
[01:25:30.244 --> 01:25:30.824]  Trust me.
[01:25:30.824 --> 01:25:31.564]  Take the shot.
[01:25:31.564 --> 01:25:33.185]  Get sterilized, black lady.
[01:25:33.185 --> 01:25:34.045]  I'm Button.
[01:25:34.045 --> 01:25:35.365]  I'm the liberal black guy.
[01:25:35.365 --> 01:25:38.346]  Take your death.
[01:25:38.346 --> 01:25:40.126]  Gonna give me that money.
[01:25:40.126 --> 01:25:43.607]  Gonna fight that racist Alex Jones.
[01:25:43.607 --> 01:25:45.407]  Oh, look, we took down a Robert E. Lee statue.
[01:25:45.407 --> 01:25:46.228]  Take a shot.
[01:25:46.228 --> 01:25:46.928]  Take a shot.
[01:25:46.928 --> 01:25:47.388]  Take a shot.
[01:25:49.853 --> 01:25:53.314]  Burn in hell, New World Order.
[01:25:53.314 --> 01:25:57.475]  So many people say to me, Alex, please stop being so negative.
[01:25:57.475 --> 01:26:02.996]  Well, for me, admitting I've gotten a rotten tooth and going in a root canal is not negative.
[01:26:02.996 --> 01:26:04.057]  It hurts.
[01:26:04.057 --> 01:26:05.117]  It stinks.
[01:26:05.117 --> 01:26:06.397]  It's got pus coming out of it.
[01:26:06.397 --> 01:26:07.737]  I go to the doctor, they fix it.
[01:26:07.737 --> 01:26:08.818]  That's not negative.
[01:26:08.818 --> 01:26:10.638]  I'm not living in denial.
[01:26:10.638 --> 01:26:16.860]  And so, think of globalism as being hidden as an infection that we didn't feel yet, but now it's come to the surface.
[01:26:16.860 --> 01:26:18.060]  That's actually a positive thing.
[01:26:18.849 --> 01:26:21.153]  And so yeah, Trump did overall a great job.
[01:26:21.153 --> 01:26:22.456]  They stole the election.
[01:26:22.456 --> 01:26:24.239]  We can't get down about that.
[01:26:24.239 --> 01:26:27.104]  We have forced them out in the open.
[01:26:28.064 --> 01:26:31.426]  So now they're trying to suppress us because they know they've been exposed.
[01:26:31.426 --> 01:26:32.286]  They're scared.
[01:26:32.286 --> 01:26:35.688]  That's why, instead of saying, oh, we're a bunch of losers, look what happened.
[01:26:35.688 --> 01:26:36.989]  No, we're a bunch of winners.
[01:26:36.989 --> 01:26:38.269]  They're trying to suppress us.
[01:26:38.269 --> 01:26:42.351]  Let our light of truth shine and tell everybody what's happening.
[01:26:42.351 --> 01:26:46.033]  Your own website, your own show, my show, other articles, other videos.
[01:26:46.033 --> 01:26:49.775]  Just keep sharing however you can and realize we're in an information war.
[01:26:49.775 --> 01:26:53.077]  We're going to win this together and the fight starts at InfoWars.com.
[01:26:54.375 --> 01:26:55.916]  Gerald of South Carolina.
[01:26:55.916 --> 01:26:56.656]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:26:56.656 --> 01:26:57.416]  Trying to move quicker.
[01:26:57.416 --> 01:26:58.236]  Hey, Alex.
[01:26:58.236 --> 01:26:58.677]  Welcome.
[01:26:58.677 --> 01:27:03.838]  Would like to say, first off, thanks for being the voice of reason in amongst all this stupidity.
[01:27:03.838 --> 01:27:07.219]  Wanted to warn people, I've been trying to get a hold of you for a year, okay?
[01:27:07.219 --> 01:27:13.682]  I'm a double amputee, and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away.
[01:27:13.682 --> 01:27:15.342]  Living Defense saved my life.
[01:27:15.342 --> 01:27:19.503]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[01:27:19.503 --> 01:27:20.944]  Living Defense brought me back.
[01:27:21.224 --> 01:27:26.748]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[01:27:26.748 --> 01:27:29.169]  This is Matthew 24 verse 9.
[01:27:29.169 --> 01:27:38.455]  Then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.
[01:27:38.455 --> 01:27:43.879]  And then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another.
[01:27:43.879 --> 01:27:45.420]  That's right where we're at, brother.
[01:27:45.620 --> 01:27:53.226]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say, and that's why the enemy hates it, because God created this country.
[01:27:53.226 --> 01:27:56.889]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:27:56.889 --> 01:28:09.618]  Infowars has been banned.
[01:28:13.767 --> 01:28:14.588]  Arrested.
[01:28:14.588 --> 01:28:20.452]  Attacked and threatened.
[01:28:20.452 --> 01:28:21.913]  Because we are effective.
[01:28:21.913 --> 01:28:25.595]  The Great Awakening is here.
[01:28:25.595 --> 01:28:27.877]  Go to band.video.
[01:28:27.877 --> 01:28:32.000]  Download the videos and share.
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:39.325]  Support the Information War at infowarestore.com.
[01:28:39.325 --> 01:28:41.026]  And never give up the fight.
[01:28:50.624 --> 01:28:57.866]  InfoWars.com.
[01:28:57.866 --> 01:28:59.147]  Jacob in Ohio.
[01:28:59.147 --> 01:28:59.547]  Welcome.
[01:28:59.547 --> 01:28:59.967]  Go ahead.
[01:28:59.967 --> 01:29:01.287]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[01:29:01.287 --> 01:29:01.847]  Good, man.
[01:29:01.847 --> 01:29:02.948]  Great last caller.
[01:29:02.948 --> 01:29:05.989]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[01:29:05.989 --> 01:29:11.690]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, demoralization, and absurdity.
[01:29:11.690 --> 01:29:13.811]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone, man.
[01:29:13.811 --> 01:29:14.231]  All right.
[01:29:14.231 --> 01:29:15.492]  Eric in New Hampshire.
[01:29:15.492 --> 01:29:16.432]  Eric, thanks for calling.
[01:29:16.432 --> 01:29:16.712]  Go ahead.
[01:29:16.792 --> 01:29:18.354]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:29:18.354 --> 01:29:21.377]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for the point of the product.
[01:29:21.377 --> 01:29:23.038]  The X2 does wonders.
[01:29:23.038 --> 01:29:24.159]  I recommend it to everybody.
[01:29:24.159 --> 01:29:25.361]  You're on the fence about it.
[01:29:25.361 --> 01:29:26.161]  Get off the fence.
[01:29:26.161 --> 01:29:27.042]  Get the product.
[01:29:27.042 --> 01:29:28.224]  Support the Infowar.
[01:29:28.224 --> 01:29:29.525]  Tyler in Maine.
[01:29:29.525 --> 01:29:30.186]  You're on the air.
[01:29:30.186 --> 01:29:30.746]  Thanks for holding.
[01:29:30.746 --> 01:29:31.106]  Go ahead.
[01:29:31.106 --> 01:29:32.828]  Hey Alex, it's great to be on with you.
[01:29:32.828 --> 01:29:33.389]  It's an honor.
[01:29:33.609 --> 01:29:34.509]  I'm honored to talk to you.
[01:29:34.509 --> 01:29:35.530]  Awesome.
[01:29:35.530 --> 01:29:41.211]  So, first thing I wanted to do is say I love the product, Alpha Power, even at 29.
[01:29:41.211 --> 01:29:45.052]  If you ask my better half, she loves it, and it helps in the bedroom.
[01:29:45.052 --> 01:29:46.732]  So, just number one for a few weeks.
[01:29:46.732 --> 01:29:47.713]  Well, it definitely works.
[01:29:47.713 --> 01:29:49.333]  It's not a joke.
[01:29:49.333 --> 01:29:57.355]  Absolutely.
[01:29:57.355 --> 01:29:59.996]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:30:27.663 --> 01:30:33.306]  The people are fighting in Africa.
[01:30:33.306 --> 01:30:35.447]  They're fighting in Europe.
[01:30:35.447 --> 01:30:36.748]  They're fighting in America.
[01:30:36.748 --> 01:30:38.329]  They're fighting in Asia.
[01:30:38.329 --> 01:30:40.750]  They're fighting in the entire planet.
[01:30:41.451 --> 01:30:42.932]  Against the globalist takeover.
[01:30:42.932 --> 01:30:45.254]  They want freedom!
[01:30:45.254 --> 01:30:47.215]  And they want it now!
[01:30:47.215 --> 01:30:57.002]  Look at the video of your TV where you can see massive demonstrations in France against forced inoculation.
[01:30:57.002 --> 01:30:57.963]  Announced.
[01:30:57.963 --> 01:31:00.544]  Taking action.
[01:31:00.544 --> 01:31:03.667]  The people are going to storm the Bastille.
[01:31:03.667 --> 01:31:09.250]  The tyrants are going to push and push and push until the bankers and the globalists are brought to justice.
[01:31:09.250 --> 01:31:09.811]  But I have
[01:31:11.667 --> 01:31:15.410]  War games, ladies and gentlemen, every angle of this.
[01:31:15.410 --> 01:31:24.258]  And they launched this bio-attack and this lockdown and all the tyranny that came out of it because they were already losing.
[01:31:24.258 --> 01:31:28.161]  And I want to warn you, they've got stuff far worse on the shelf.
[01:31:28.161 --> 01:31:35.628]  The evidence looks like they're already releasing to try to suppress us and control us.
[01:31:35.628 --> 01:31:38.310]  Now, I know it's entertaining when I blow up and all that, but that's not an act.
[01:31:38.310 --> 01:31:39.171]  That's not fake, folks.
[01:31:42.466 --> 01:31:46.329]  And I think it's a manifestation, though, of all of us.
[01:31:46.329 --> 01:31:48.391]  We're pissed.
[01:31:48.391 --> 01:31:53.995]  And I am pissed at the black leaders, particularly, because it's true.
[01:31:53.995 --> 01:31:57.638]  They're particularly targeting black people with their extermination operation.
[01:31:57.638 --> 01:32:03.402]  That's why they bought off the black leaders to try to make their whole movement say it supports black people.
[01:32:03.402 --> 01:32:04.743]  It's a disgusting fraud.
[01:32:05.735 --> 01:32:07.677]  And I'm not going to kiss black people's ass.
[01:32:07.677 --> 01:32:09.218]  I haven't done anything to you.
[01:32:09.218 --> 01:32:10.620]  I'm a champion for human liberty.
[01:32:10.620 --> 01:32:13.783]  All I care about you got red blood and you're human.
[01:32:13.783 --> 01:32:24.133]  And so it's time to dispense with the white liberals that go, oh, you're a racist if you don't do like I say, because I'm pissed off at the black people.
[01:32:24.133 --> 01:32:24.453]  I out.
[01:32:25.259 --> 01:32:27.782]  I outrageously hate white liberals.
[01:32:27.782 --> 01:32:30.845]  I mean, they're at a whole other level than black liberals.
[01:32:30.845 --> 01:32:34.930]  You talk about somebody I really don't like, it's these white people.
[01:32:34.930 --> 01:32:42.759]  So I think we can really organize around the fact that the white liberal thinks they control all of us and are playing us off against each other.
[01:32:42.759 --> 01:32:44.000]  And they're fake!
[01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:45.201]  And they're evil!
[01:32:45.201 --> 01:32:46.543]  And they gotta be dealt with!
[01:32:47.739 --> 01:32:52.782]  Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates and Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger!
[01:32:52.782 --> 01:32:59.026]  You want to put me in a forced labor camp, Charlie Munger?
[01:32:59.026 --> 01:33:04.469]  You think I exist for your old evil ass to fill power now?
[01:33:04.469 --> 01:33:13.934]  My ancestors didn't do what they did so you could piss on me, you piece of filth!
[01:33:13.934 --> 01:33:15.335]  Doesn't matter, God's gonna destroy them.
[01:33:16.866 --> 01:33:19.648]  And that's why all of us that think the enemy's winning, you're wrong.
[01:33:19.648 --> 01:33:20.669]  The enemy's losing.
[01:33:20.669 --> 01:33:22.791]  This is all desperate behavior by the globalists.
[01:33:22.791 --> 01:33:23.272]  Okay, let me stop.
[01:33:23.272 --> 01:33:33.120]  You know, I literally have, like, 50 incredible articles and video, and I'm so mad after watching them, I can't even cover it.
[01:33:41.932 --> 01:33:42.492]  Let's do this.
[01:33:42.492 --> 01:33:53.917]  I got Dixon, William, Barbara, Rob, Luke, First Timer, Louisiana, Gail, John, Jerry, Boomer, Cody, and others.
[01:33:53.917 --> 01:33:58.139]  And we got Derrick McBride's new powerful compilation everybody should see to save lives.
[01:33:58.139 --> 01:33:58.939]  This is life and death.
[01:33:58.939 --> 01:34:00.500]  I don't just say this is life and death.
[01:34:00.500 --> 01:34:01.540]  This is life and death.
[01:34:01.540 --> 01:34:02.641]  This is life and death.
[01:34:03.408 --> 01:34:06.790]  Deadly COVID side effects are not rare.
[01:34:06.790 --> 01:34:08.090]  And you know, McBrain's a great guy.
[01:34:08.090 --> 01:34:09.851]  He's a great editor, a great researcher.
[01:34:09.851 --> 01:34:15.173]  But let's just change this headline and make it more accurate.
[01:34:15.173 --> 01:34:19.035]  The COVID vaccine is designed to kill you.
[01:34:19.035 --> 01:34:20.356]  Death is its main effect.
[01:34:20.356 --> 01:34:22.196]  Or how do you say that?
[01:34:22.196 --> 01:34:24.698]  The COVID vaccine is not a vaccine.
[01:34:24.698 --> 01:34:27.679]  It's a kill shot.
[01:34:27.679 --> 01:34:30.240]  The COVID vaccine is designed to kill you.
[01:34:30.240 --> 01:34:31.681]  Death is not a side effect.
[01:34:31.681 --> 01:34:32.241]  How do you say that?
[01:34:33.257 --> 01:34:38.802]  Because it's not a side effect.
[01:34:38.802 --> 01:34:40.824]  Powerful video.
[01:34:40.824 --> 01:34:42.966]  Needs to get seen 10 billion times.
[01:34:42.966 --> 01:34:44.627]  Needs to save the world.
[01:34:44.627 --> 01:34:49.272]  Only way dog hunts, you let it out.
[01:34:49.272 --> 01:34:51.474]  Four minutes.
[01:34:52.861 --> 01:34:58.883]  Because he has to be able to have it work and air as a, we don't really run a lot of ads here on TV, it's just information.
[01:34:58.883 --> 01:35:05.485]  And to ask me four minutes, he could be 20 minutes long of just quick clips, this person died, that person died, they died, she died.
[01:35:05.485 --> 01:35:08.606]  Hell, let's do this, let's air it.
[01:35:08.606 --> 01:35:16.788]  And then start your engines when I come back out of that break, I'm going right to your phone calls here.
[01:35:16.788 --> 01:35:21.870]  But I mean, seriously, I take it personal when they're raping us and murdering us like this.
[01:35:22.863 --> 01:35:28.267]  And we've just got to get out of our shells and realize this is going on and admit it and just... So you've ever been in a fight?
[01:35:28.267 --> 01:35:29.287]  I'm sure a lot of you have.
[01:35:29.287 --> 01:35:30.468]  You're kind of a little scared.
[01:35:30.468 --> 01:35:31.489]  Guy's pretty big at first.
[01:35:31.489 --> 01:35:32.529]  All of a sudden the fight starts.
[01:35:32.529 --> 01:35:34.170]  You ain't worried now.
[01:35:34.170 --> 01:35:36.071]  You're beating the living hell out of them.
[01:35:36.071 --> 01:35:36.992]  And they attack you back.
[01:35:36.992 --> 01:35:37.752]  It doesn't matter.
[01:35:37.752 --> 01:35:38.673]  You're in the fight now.
[01:35:38.673 --> 01:35:42.055]  Well, let me give you a little news flash, boys and girls.
[01:35:42.055 --> 01:35:43.756]  You're in the fight now, baby!
[01:35:43.756 --> 01:35:45.477]  They're coming for you!
[01:35:45.477 --> 01:35:48.539]  There ain't no more games now!
[01:35:48.539 --> 01:35:49.840]  You're gonna let them keep killing us?
[01:35:50.515 --> 01:35:51.976]  Or are you going to spread the word?
[01:35:51.976 --> 01:35:53.497]  Here it is!
[01:35:53.497 --> 01:35:57.079]  A word of warning to you, my fellow Americans.
[01:35:57.079 --> 01:36:00.341]  The second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine is no joke.
[01:36:00.341 --> 01:36:09.246]  I had the COVID booster, the Moderna, about four or five days ago, and I'm still feeling wild side effects from it.
[01:36:09.246 --> 01:36:11.868]  It made me feel worse than I felt in a long time.
[01:36:11.868 --> 01:36:13.889]  Like I had the worst flu in the world.
[01:36:14.189 --> 01:36:15.970]  Extreme shortness of breath.
[01:36:15.970 --> 01:36:17.752]  I just felt so bad.
[01:36:17.752 --> 01:36:19.373]  A dizziness, fatigue.
[01:36:19.373 --> 01:36:21.575]  Shaking chills, fever.
[01:36:21.575 --> 01:36:23.877]  Extremely irrational thinking.
[01:36:23.877 --> 01:36:25.418]  Aches, headaches.
[01:36:25.418 --> 01:36:27.440]  And it has just been devastating.
[01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:28.641]  Just felt miserable.
[01:36:28.641 --> 01:36:31.203]  I was out for the count for about a week.
[01:36:31.203 --> 01:36:34.305]  Agony and chronic pain.
[01:36:34.305 --> 01:36:38.108]  I lost the use of my hands for about three weeks.
[01:36:38.108 --> 01:36:42.192]  The vaccine took my immune system and just shook it around again.
[01:36:43.147 --> 01:36:44.389]  And that's still going on.
[01:36:44.389 --> 01:36:50.139]  And in Orange County, an x-ray technician has died after getting his second dose of the Pfizer vaccine.
[01:36:50.139 --> 01:36:53.004]  Cassidy got the second Moderna shot on a Monday.
[01:36:53.004 --> 01:36:55.528]  By Thursday morning, they were in the ER.
[01:36:55.528 --> 01:36:56.530]  She got sick.
[01:36:57.429 --> 01:36:58.290]  Right away.
[01:36:58.290 --> 01:37:04.996]  The death of his youngest daughter, Cassidy, came out of nowhere four days after her second dose of the COVID vaccine.
[01:37:04.996 --> 01:37:08.819]  Everybody from her work had kind of had flu-like symptoms.
[01:37:08.819 --> 01:37:11.681]  Just like the nurse was telling us earlier today when we got tested.
[01:37:11.681 --> 01:37:13.063]  She experienced chills.
[01:37:13.063 --> 01:37:14.644]  And she said all her friends did too.
[01:37:14.644 --> 01:37:15.705]  Yep, all her friends did.
[01:37:15.805 --> 01:37:24.410]  There's a report from the New York Times that there's been a severe allergic reaction from a healthcare worker in Alaska after receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.
[01:37:24.410 --> 01:37:29.153]  Patriot doctor in Missouri works at nursing home and wants to comment on COVID vaccines.
[01:37:29.153 --> 01:37:30.113]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[01:37:30.113 --> 01:37:32.995]  So, I'm a geriatrician.
[01:37:32.995 --> 01:37:34.616]  I'm family medicine trained.
[01:37:34.616 --> 01:37:35.756]  I'm a geriatrician.
[01:37:35.756 --> 01:37:36.597]  I work in nursing homes.
[01:37:37.238 --> 01:37:47.830]  I have had 21 patients that I've identified that have died within 48 hours of getting either the first or second vaccine from AstraZeneca.
[01:37:47.830 --> 01:37:52.656]  She was healthy, happy, active.
[01:37:54.927 --> 01:38:08.533]  The greatest mom you ever saw in your life and then she was so sick that she was you know in less than probably 12 hours she was intubated and on life support and then she passed.
[01:38:08.533 --> 01:38:16.417]  When you get this spike protein antibody in your system it will permanently and irreversibly change your immune system.
[01:38:16.417 --> 01:38:22.920]  When you inject this shot that has this polyethylene glycol on the coating on the outside of it
[01:38:23.420 --> 01:38:27.984]  That is what is leading to anaphylactic reactions, shock, and death.
[01:38:27.984 --> 01:38:35.550]  I think we're going to see massive injuries and a lot more deaths start somewhere between 4 and 18 months from now.
[01:38:35.550 --> 01:38:40.713]  Upon receiving the second shot, Maddie immediately felt pain at the injection site.
[01:38:40.713 --> 01:38:46.398]  And over the next 24 hours, she developed severe abdominal and chest pain in the way she described
[01:38:47.501 --> 01:38:53.928]  The 35-year-old wife and mother of four died, quote, as the result of complications after receiving the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine.
[01:39:06.903 --> 01:39:13.169]  Mom 45, who got job at John Hopkins Hospital, dies after reaction to work-mandated COVID vaccine.
[01:39:13.169 --> 01:39:14.250]  You ought to read about her.
[01:39:14.250 --> 01:39:15.330]  I ought to read her Facebook.
[01:39:15.330 --> 01:39:16.251]  But you better read it quick.
[01:39:16.251 --> 01:39:18.874]  Most people that die, they take their Facebooks down.
[01:39:18.874 --> 01:39:28.242]  A handful of deaths, including Griselda's, are under investigation because they happened one to three days after the person got a COVID-19 vaccine dose.
[01:39:28.242 --> 01:39:31.925]  His dad died four days after getting a second shot of Pfizer vaccine.
[01:39:32.225 --> 01:39:42.516]  A 20-year-old who loved the vaccines, promoted the vaccines, said how great they were, went to get her vaccine, died weeks after getting her mandated Russian Roulette shot.
[01:39:42.516 --> 01:39:44.878]  The first man that took it died.
[01:39:44.878 --> 01:39:46.299]  Killed her.
[01:39:46.299 --> 01:39:48.502]  The first guy to take it died after he took it.
[01:39:53.542 --> 01:39:56.926]  X2 has been our number one bestseller over the years.
[01:39:56.926 --> 01:39:59.729]  Deep Earth Crystal Iodine, the good halogen.
[01:39:59.729 --> 01:40:02.591]  It is essential for all actions in the body.
[01:40:02.591 --> 01:40:04.053]  You must have it to live.
[01:40:04.053 --> 01:40:08.217]  The UN estimates 2 billion plus people have cognitive disabilities because they don't have enough iodine.
[01:40:08.217 --> 01:40:14.283]  We have X2 in two different bottles, same amount in each bottle, but one has a spray top, one has a dropper top.
[01:40:14.283 --> 01:40:15.645]  60% off on the spray top,
[01:40:16.345 --> 01:40:21.190]  40% off on the dropper top for a limited time because they're both selling out.
[01:40:21.190 --> 01:40:23.612]  I want to thank all the supporters that have got me over the years.
[01:40:23.612 --> 01:40:24.493]  They're amazing.
[01:40:24.493 --> 01:40:26.695]  So that's a great deal for you to stock up on it.
[01:40:26.695 --> 01:40:32.140]  But this deal is really for folks that have been on the fence and haven't experienced the good halogen for yourself.
[01:40:32.140 --> 01:40:34.462]  So, X2, the dropper bottle and the spray bottle.
[01:40:35.242 --> 01:40:39.684]  60% and 40% off for a limited time because it's selling out right now at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:40:39.684 --> 01:40:41.845]  But we're going to keep this sale going until it sells out.
[01:40:41.845 --> 01:40:43.586]  It'll probably take about two weeks.
[01:40:43.586 --> 01:40:44.727]  Don't procrastinate.
[01:40:44.727 --> 01:40:57.653]  Take advantage of this special right now at InfoWareStore.com and check out the new products we just got in as well.
[01:40:57.653 --> 01:40:58.893]  Granny Do-Right.
[01:40:58.893 --> 01:40:59.654]  Granny Do-Right.
[01:41:03.485 --> 01:41:04.486]  I love your products.
[01:41:04.486 --> 01:41:15.209]  I am a granny, and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots, or age spots, as they're lovingly called.
[01:41:15.209 --> 01:41:21.210]  But since taking Urex 2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous, actually.
[01:41:21.210 --> 01:41:22.251]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[01:41:24.491 --> 01:41:32.214]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[01:41:32.214 --> 01:41:40.977]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket.
[01:41:40.977 --> 01:41:41.797]  This is working.
[01:41:41.797 --> 01:41:42.798]  This is wonderful.
[01:41:42.798 --> 01:41:47.319]  You know, I don't, I don't have to put on Dermablend anymore, you know?
[01:41:47.319 --> 01:41:51.961]  So anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[01:41:54.990 --> 01:42:03.175]  I preach about the dangers of cell phones all day long because they're supercomputers controlled by big tech that are spying on us everywhere we go and what we do.
[01:42:03.175 --> 01:42:11.941]  But because they have great cameras and great recording systems and great ways to communicate, I still have one because this Trojan horse, this Promethean Fire, has a lot of power.
[01:42:11.941 --> 01:42:18.906]  But when I'm not using it, I lock it up in a high-quality Faraday cage, a privacy pocket, at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:42:18.906 --> 01:42:21.527]  We finally got them back in stock, the highest rated.
[01:42:21.527 --> 01:42:23.969]  They fit almost all types of Androids and iPhones.
[01:42:24.309 --> 01:42:25.170]  We're good to go.
[01:42:54.172 --> 01:42:54.412]  We're good
[01:43:11.732 --> 01:43:12.492]  What is that food?
[01:43:12.492 --> 01:43:13.012]  Iodine.
[01:43:13.012 --> 01:43:17.593]  But if your food doesn't have that atomic pure iodine, it can't operate.
[01:43:17.593 --> 01:43:19.534]  And the food itself is lacking.
[01:43:19.534 --> 01:43:22.954]  That's why most people on Earth are deficient in iodine.
[01:43:22.954 --> 01:43:27.415]  And governments are lowering the allowance you're supposed to need to have because they want control.
[01:43:27.415 --> 01:43:29.536]  Ladies and gentlemen, our information is powerful.
[01:43:29.536 --> 01:43:31.016]  Our products are just as powerful.
[01:43:31.016 --> 01:43:32.936]  Experience clean iodine today.
[01:43:32.936 --> 01:43:33.636]  It's discounted.
[01:43:33.636 --> 01:43:35.457]  40% off at the dropper bottle.
[01:43:35.457 --> 01:43:37.517]  60% off at the spray bottle.
[01:43:37.517 --> 01:43:38.577]  You take it to your mouth.
[01:43:38.577 --> 01:43:40.698]  Pure atomic iodine with free shipping.
[01:43:40.698 --> 01:43:41.438]  Double pay three points.
[01:43:41.718 --> 01:43:42.799]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:44:16.914 --> 01:44:21.257]  You're listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:44:21.257 --> 01:44:22.738]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:44:22.738 --> 01:44:30.784]  Okay, so, the globalists all operate on, we're gonna evolve to submit to be slaves.
[01:44:30.784 --> 01:44:37.750]  They're gonna hit us with tyranny and say, oh, the answer's a world ID, personal passport, microchip under the skin, and once you do that, you're free.
[01:44:37.750 --> 01:44:39.431]  Of course, you're not free once you do that.
[01:44:39.431 --> 01:44:40.912]  But they think we don't have long-term memory.
[01:44:42.859 --> 01:44:45.620]  Well, an animal doesn't remember.
[01:44:45.620 --> 01:44:51.301]  Whether it's a prey animal, a bunny rabbit, or whether it's a tiger, it kind of operates in live time.
[01:44:51.301 --> 01:44:55.261]  But a human can think long-term.
[01:44:55.261 --> 01:45:02.623]  And so does submitting to Globalist make me healthier, freer, more successful?
[01:45:02.623 --> 01:45:06.583]  Or does it enslave me?
[01:45:06.583 --> 01:45:09.144]  And so it's that process we have to think about.
[01:45:09.144 --> 01:45:10.724]  And understand they're manipulating us
[01:45:12.105 --> 01:45:13.386]  With that same process.
[01:45:13.386 --> 01:45:19.110]  Okay, the French are burning stuff down and going crazy right now and they're doing it in Cuba too to get out of tyranny.
[01:45:19.110 --> 01:45:20.711]  But the globalists think it's going to go away.
[01:45:20.711 --> 01:45:24.433]  They think it's going to stop.
[01:45:24.433 --> 01:45:27.295]  What if they were like the real French resistance?
[01:45:27.295 --> 01:45:39.624]  What if they weren't just rioting on the street like the media shows you to, but what if leftist leaders, think tank members, board members of the Great Reset were at their home in Paris and
[01:45:41.036 --> 01:45:42.697]  Somebody dropped by to have tea with him.
[01:45:42.697 --> 01:45:47.441]  Then that would be a different response.
[01:45:47.441 --> 01:45:50.964]  We're supposed to go fight with the cops, who are the same as us.
[01:45:50.964 --> 01:45:52.465]  No.
[01:45:52.465 --> 01:46:01.752]  Targeted activity.
[01:46:01.752 --> 01:46:05.595]  French citizens riot in response to plan to mandate vaccine passports.
[01:46:05.595 --> 01:46:06.416]  Not vaccines.
[01:46:06.416 --> 01:46:06.916]  Deadly.
[01:46:06.916 --> 01:46:07.717]  Illegal.
[01:46:07.717 --> 01:46:08.458]  Experimental.
[01:46:08.458 --> 01:46:08.998]  Injection.
[01:46:08.998 --> 01:46:09.598]  Violation.
[01:46:09.598 --> 01:46:10.219]  Nuremberg Code.
[01:46:14.310 --> 01:46:24.139]  Oh, blackout warfare, document warrants of devastating cyber attack by China, but the globalists will launch it and say it's China but still do nothing.
[01:46:24.139 --> 01:46:29.323]  Because we're seen as wimps, because we're seen as dumb, they're going to do all this.
[01:46:29.323 --> 01:46:34.928]  The average American thinks if I comply and I'm nice and I go along with official statements, I'll get ahead.
[01:46:34.928 --> 01:46:35.949]  That's all over.
[01:46:35.949 --> 01:46:38.652]  That's in the past.
[01:46:38.652 --> 01:46:40.033]  Complying gets you dead now.
[01:46:43.190 --> 01:46:45.892]  All right, we got loaded phone lines.
[01:46:45.892 --> 01:46:48.154]  I'm gonna go to Cody and then Dixon.
[01:46:48.154 --> 01:46:51.216]  Cody is in Missouri, the FEMA camps, it's announced.
[01:46:51.216 --> 01:47:02.225]  And now when the next lockdown comes, which they're saying they're getting ready for, they're gonna come grab you and disappear you and then you're in a government medical center where they can, it's time for your intubation, Mr. Jones.
[01:47:02.225 --> 01:47:04.766]  Oh, Mr. Jones died of COVID.
[01:47:04.766 --> 01:47:05.707]  So they make it easy.
[01:47:05.707 --> 01:47:08.809]  Now they're going to the physical.
[01:47:08.809 --> 01:47:09.930]  And now the gloves come off.
[01:47:09.930 --> 01:47:10.571]  See how that works?
[01:47:11.491 --> 01:47:13.373]  But, uh, Cody, give us your take on that.
[01:47:13.373 --> 01:47:22.664]  I wanted to apologize, because I stumbled across you ten years ago, and I go, oh, Alex Jones is nuts.
[01:47:22.664 --> 01:47:24.205]  And I want to say sorry.
[01:47:24.205 --> 01:47:27.249]  I should have listened to you then, and maybe things would be different today.
[01:47:27.856 --> 01:47:29.216]  No need to apologize, brother.
[01:47:29.216 --> 01:47:29.697]  It's okay.
[01:47:29.697 --> 01:47:31.317]  I understand.
[01:47:31.317 --> 01:47:32.478]  I was reading globalist documents.
[01:47:32.478 --> 01:47:33.958]  They sound insane, don't they?
[01:47:33.958 --> 01:47:34.918]  Yes, they do.
[01:47:34.918 --> 01:47:38.079]  And I think that's one of the reasons why a lot of people don't believe it.
[01:47:38.079 --> 01:47:45.042]  But as far as these FEMA camps and trying to force people, I live in a rural community of a few thousand people.
[01:47:45.042 --> 01:47:50.744]  We never had a mask mandate at all in the state or where we were at within the state.
[01:47:50.744 --> 01:47:51.624]  They tried.
[01:47:51.624 --> 01:47:52.965]  People just wouldn't comply.
[01:47:52.965 --> 01:47:55.765]  The cops don't wear masks.
[01:47:55.765 --> 01:47:57.106]  They just would not comply.
[01:47:57.771 --> 01:48:02.635]  So, if they were to try to do something like this, they'd have to bring in an exterior force.
[01:48:02.635 --> 01:48:03.595]  And that's the key.
[01:48:03.595 --> 01:48:08.018]  Where you have regular cops in libertarian and conservative areas, they're the leaders.
[01:48:08.018 --> 01:48:08.999]  They get it all.
[01:48:08.999 --> 01:48:11.041]  But in leftist areas, they're total oppressors.
[01:48:11.041 --> 01:48:16.905]  You know, in Canada, the U.S., and Britain, we've got the videos, they're building whole cities for the new quarantines.
[01:48:17.745 --> 01:48:23.989]  Yes, I saw that on your show the other day, which is pretty disturbing, but I've paused to think.
[01:48:23.989 --> 01:48:25.530]  By the way, that was a caller!
[01:48:25.530 --> 01:48:26.771]  We just googled what she said.
[01:48:26.771 --> 01:48:27.432]  We went and checked.
[01:48:27.432 --> 01:48:28.292]  It's all true.
[01:48:28.292 --> 01:48:31.575]  They're building giant death camps all over the world, brother.
[01:48:31.575 --> 01:48:34.877]  That's why I'm like, what are we supposed to do now?
[01:48:34.877 --> 01:48:35.637]  It's scary.
[01:48:35.637 --> 01:48:45.204]  Well, you know, I go back to Stoyetkin and the Gulag Archipelago, and he mentions the fact that if people had stood up within communities,
[01:48:46.178 --> 01:48:47.882]  I don't want to interrupt you, but pull it up.
[01:48:47.882 --> 01:48:49.044]  Pull it up for me on screen.
[01:48:49.044 --> 01:48:50.788]  Oh, how we burned to the champs.
[01:48:50.788 --> 01:48:53.333]  Alexander Schultz and Ibsen put the quote up.
[01:48:53.333 --> 01:48:56.640]  If they would have just attacked when it started, it wouldn't have happened.
[01:48:57.296 --> 01:48:58.176]  Correct.
[01:48:58.176 --> 01:49:04.319]  But you see people that, you know, right now it's like, don't advocate violence, but you have the right to defend yourself.
[01:49:04.319 --> 01:49:07.281]  Well, I see people- They're coming with a poison shot.
[01:49:07.281 --> 01:49:10.242]  Do I blame the- Like I said, I'm a black person.
[01:49:10.242 --> 01:49:12.063]  They hired me because I'm black.
[01:49:12.063 --> 01:49:13.304]  So you trust this shot.
[01:49:13.304 --> 01:49:17.886]  That the black guy coming to your door for $12 an hour trying to give you a shot's not your enemy.
[01:49:17.886 --> 01:49:19.767]  He isn't part of that.
[01:49:19.767 --> 01:49:24.989]  So they hope we kill him, see, to create- Oh, now you're anti-vaxxer terrorist.
[01:49:24.989 --> 01:49:25.830]  See how it works?
[01:49:25.830 --> 01:49:26.290]  See how it works?
[01:49:26.750 --> 01:49:26.870]  Yes.
[01:49:45.430 --> 01:49:48.594]  What I think will happen is people won't submit in these areas.
[01:49:48.594 --> 01:49:51.978]  People have already decided if they want the shot or don't.
[01:49:51.978 --> 01:49:55.742]  And they want to make people feel alone, so you feel, oh, I'm ostracized.
[01:49:55.742 --> 01:49:56.984]  I'm the one man out.
[01:49:56.984 --> 01:49:58.085]  Maybe I should join.
[01:49:59.057 --> 01:50:02.441]  And, but these rural communities tend to be the way they want.
[01:50:02.441 --> 01:50:06.045]  You see people growing, I hate to say victory gardens, like World War II.
[01:50:06.045 --> 01:50:10.850]  I've seen more gardens being grown now than I have ever in my entire life.
[01:50:10.850 --> 01:50:13.492]  Everyone instinctively is going to the country.
[01:50:13.492 --> 01:50:15.034]  Black, white, old, young.
[01:50:15.034 --> 01:50:16.235]  Everybody's growing stuff.
[01:50:16.235 --> 01:50:16.896]  We get it, don't we?
[01:50:17.631 --> 01:50:18.231]  Yes.
[01:50:18.231 --> 01:50:29.996]  And so when they think that they're going to do this, as you know, in war, one of the best laid plans is you can plan everything out and it goes to hell after the first shot.
[01:50:29.996 --> 01:50:30.416]  And so
[01:50:31.132 --> 01:50:45.319]  They, uh, they're trying to be careful, but all it takes is, you know, they're on a razor's edge, and all it takes is a little push either way, and so they're pushing for that right now, and if they're not careful, they're going to wake more people up.
[01:50:45.319 --> 01:50:53.102]  I think they're being reckless, because 2022... I agree, and I always go off my spiritual energy, because I have an intellectual prowess, and we all have that.
[01:50:53.102 --> 01:50:59.205]  I have my, my, but my spiritual level is on fire for war, and I'm trying to control myself, but it's like,
[01:50:59.745 --> 01:51:00.306]  You know what I mean?
[01:51:00.306 --> 01:51:05.691]  I mean, I'm ready to kick some ass, but I'm going to control myself and focus that into information.
[01:51:05.691 --> 01:51:06.852]  What are you going to do?
[01:51:06.852 --> 01:51:10.296]  Well, as of right now, I've been actually getting myself healthy.
[01:51:10.296 --> 01:51:11.237]  I've been preparing.
[01:51:11.237 --> 01:51:13.659]  I buy your products.
[01:51:13.659 --> 01:51:15.341]  Your shirts are great, by the way.
[01:51:15.341 --> 01:51:17.203]  They're some of the best shirts I've ever worn.
[01:51:17.203 --> 01:51:20.366]  They don't fly up after they've been washed a bunch of times.
[01:51:22.228 --> 01:51:32.234]  I've got my own garden, I've been teaching my children how to survive out in the woods, as extreme as that might sound, but people in cities have lost how to do basic things.
[01:51:32.234 --> 01:51:38.818]  We gotta go back to, and that's the thing, is they take it weird that we're upset about this, our basic rights, this evil group coming after us.
[01:51:38.818 --> 01:51:40.379]  It's normal to get pissed.
[01:51:40.379 --> 01:51:41.820]  We have this energy to get angry.
[01:51:41.820 --> 01:51:43.581]  God bless you, I appreciate your call.
[01:51:43.581 --> 01:51:46.863]  Alright, thank you, Cody.
[01:51:46.863 --> 01:51:49.545]  And if I'm wild today, I'm sorry, the energy level's just off the charts right now.
[01:51:49.545 --> 01:51:51.006]  Whatever's going on behind the scenes, I'm...
[01:51:52.891 --> 01:51:53.951]  Dixon in Canada.
[01:51:53.951 --> 01:51:54.452]  You're on the air.
[01:51:54.452 --> 01:51:54.952]  Thanks for holding.
[01:51:54.952 --> 01:51:56.812]  Welcome.
[01:51:56.812 --> 01:51:57.752]  Alex.
[01:51:57.752 --> 01:51:58.633]  Yes, sir.
[01:51:58.633 --> 01:51:59.633]  Great to talk to you.
[01:51:59.633 --> 01:52:02.374]  You know, you have a rare spirit.
[01:52:02.374 --> 01:52:04.194]  It's the Phineas spirit.
[01:52:04.194 --> 01:52:06.315]  I'm sure you know what I mean.
[01:52:06.315 --> 01:52:13.657]  It's rare, but it's alive in the USA, and you're not alone.
[01:52:13.657 --> 01:52:16.898]  You're inspiring a lot of people, and don't ever forget that.
[01:52:16.898 --> 01:52:20.659]  Even if it sounds like you're a voice crying in the wilderness by yourself,
[01:52:21.835 --> 01:52:25.537]  There are a lot here and things are going to start changing.
[01:52:25.537 --> 01:52:37.904]  What I wanted to talk about was the inflection point that is coming this fall with these internment camps and these door-to-door canvassing, to put it politely.
[01:52:37.904 --> 01:52:41.306]  This is all... Yeah, that's just the normalization.
[01:52:41.306 --> 01:52:43.727]  Next it's taking people away, they admit that.
[01:52:43.727 --> 01:52:45.688]  So explain to them what's about to happen.
[01:52:45.688 --> 01:52:48.230]  Yes, and you know, I'm here in Canada and
[01:52:49.135 --> 01:52:58.540]  We've had these camps being built now for since, well, they were publicly acknowledged in the legislature a year ago.
[01:52:58.540 --> 01:52:59.861]  But the government wouldn't talk about it.
[01:52:59.861 --> 01:53:02.983]  They wouldn't answer any questions and they're still not.
[01:53:02.983 --> 01:53:15.750]  But Alex, what I want to say is we've been here before in our ancient past when Israel was marching out of the New World Order of that day out of Egypt.
[01:53:17.667 --> 01:53:20.690]  We were in the same predicament.
[01:53:20.690 --> 01:53:30.297]  The firstborn of Israel were being killed and the plan was to exterminate all of Israel.
[01:53:30.297 --> 01:53:35.060]  And whether you're native-born or whether you're grafted in really doesn't matter.
[01:53:35.060 --> 01:53:42.306]  We know who real Israel is and we're following the same pattern today and we can learn a lot
[01:53:42.873 --> 01:53:49.318]  From the template that's in the scripture, there are at least seven different prophets that talk about it.
[01:53:49.318 --> 01:53:51.560]  Way too many for me to cover.
[01:53:51.560 --> 01:53:53.922]  Well, I'm going to hold you over, because you're right.
[01:53:53.922 --> 01:53:57.505]  The parallels, the Ramses II, and the Exodus is happening.
[01:53:58.257 --> 01:54:03.423]  And it is exactly what's going on, because the Bible repeats itself towards the big event.
[01:54:03.423 --> 01:54:14.195]  So we're going to come back to Dixon, and then I promise, William, Barbara, Bob, Luke, first time, Gail, James, Jerry, Boomer, I'm going to go in the order your calls came in.
[01:54:14.195 --> 01:54:15.897]  That's from order, top to down.
[01:54:15.897 --> 01:54:17.459]  We're going to take your calls on the other side.
[01:54:18.314 --> 01:54:20.576]  I want to thank the listeners for keeping us on air.
[01:54:20.576 --> 01:54:22.378]  Without you, we wouldn't be here.
[01:54:22.378 --> 01:54:23.980]  And it's just such an amazing time.
[01:54:23.980 --> 01:54:25.762]  I mean, it's all being confirmed.
[01:54:25.762 --> 01:54:27.043]  We're reading your text messages.
[01:54:27.043 --> 01:54:28.504]  We're going to take your children.
[01:54:28.504 --> 01:54:30.646]  We're going to kill you.
[01:54:30.646 --> 01:54:33.289]  It's just unbelievable, fabulous evil.
[01:54:33.289 --> 01:54:34.350]  Oh, you're Cuban.
[01:54:34.350 --> 01:54:36.132]  You can't come to America, says Biden.
[01:54:36.132 --> 01:54:39.095]  I mean, it's just insane evil.
[01:54:39.095 --> 01:54:40.917]  It's all out in the open now.
[01:54:43.440 --> 01:54:46.843]  X2 has been our number one bestseller over the years.
[01:54:46.843 --> 01:54:49.625]  Deep Earth Crystal Iodine, the good halogen.
[01:54:49.625 --> 01:54:52.508]  It is essential for all actions in the body.
[01:54:52.508 --> 01:54:53.949]  You must have it to live.
[01:54:53.949 --> 01:54:58.113]  The UN estimates 2 billion plus people have cognitive disabilities because they don't have enough iodine.
[01:54:58.113 --> 01:55:04.518]  We have X2 in two different bottles, same amount in each bottle, but one has a spray top, one has a dropper top.
[01:55:04.518 --> 01:55:05.559]  60% off on the spray top,
[01:55:06.019 --> 01:55:11.102]  40% off on the dropper top for a limited time because they're both selling out.
[01:55:11.102 --> 01:55:13.444]  I want to thank all the supporters that have gotten these over the years.
[01:55:13.444 --> 01:55:16.586]  They're amazing, so that's a great deal for you to stock up on it.
[01:55:16.586 --> 01:55:22.029]  But this deal is really for folks that have been on the fence and haven't experienced the good halogen for yourself.
[01:55:22.029 --> 01:55:29.614]  So, X2, the dropper bottle and the spray bottle, 60 and 40% off for a limited time because it's selling out right now at InfoWarshaw.com.
[01:55:29.614 --> 01:55:31.815]  But we're going to keep this sale going until it sells out.
[01:55:31.815 --> 01:55:33.116]  It'll probably take about two weeks.
[01:55:33.496 --> 01:55:34.638]  Don't procrastinate.
[01:55:34.638 --> 01:55:46.551]  Take advantage of this special right now at F4WarStore.com and check out the new products we just got in as well.

[01:55:57.621 --> 01:55:59.142]  AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[01:55:59.142 --> 01:56:00.502]  AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[01:56:00.502 --> 01:56:01.463]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[01:56:01.463 --> 01:56:02.523]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store... Sorry!
[01:56:02.523 --> 01:56:04.104]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[01:56:04.104 --> 01:56:04.944]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store...
[01:56:23.832 --> 01:56:27.294]  InfoWarsStore.com is simply the best!
[01:56:27.294 --> 01:56:30.355]  InfoWarsStore.com beats out all the rest!
[01:56:30.355 --> 01:56:32.156]  888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, it's the InfoWarsStore of life!
[01:56:32.156 --> 01:56:33.356]  888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, that's InfoWarsStore.com!
[01:56:33.356 --> 01:56:35.077]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:57:04.966 --> 01:57:06.927]  Folks are protesting in Miami against communism.
[01:57:06.927 --> 01:57:07.947]  It's the total enslavement.
[01:57:31.116 --> 01:57:34.598]  And of course, Joe Biden is not supporting it.
[01:57:34.598 --> 01:57:36.239]  Because he's a tyrant.
[01:57:36.239 --> 01:57:39.120]  Alright, let's go back to the callers here.
[01:57:39.120 --> 01:57:40.021]  Dixon in Canada.
[01:57:40.021 --> 01:57:42.042]  You were making a point about the tipping point.
[01:57:42.042 --> 01:57:42.862]  What's going to happen next?
[01:57:42.862 --> 01:57:44.503]  Please tell me your view on it.
[01:57:44.503 --> 01:57:51.326]  Yes, so our march out of Egypt back then was a seven-day march.
[01:57:51.326 --> 01:57:55.348]  And the latter fulfillment of it is on a much bigger scale.
[01:57:55.348 --> 01:57:56.649]  It's a seven-year march.
[01:57:56.649 --> 01:57:57.990]  And it began in 2017 with Trump's presidency.
[01:58:01.454 --> 01:58:11.261]  So, we all know what happened on the 6th day with Pharaoh's army and on the 7th day with the deliverance, but there are more details given in the book of Jasher.
[01:58:11.261 --> 01:58:12.542]  I don't know if you've ever read it.
[01:58:12.542 --> 01:58:13.062]  Chapter 81.
[01:58:13.062 --> 01:58:21.388]  It's a history book that the Bible refers to as recommended reading on two separate occasions.
[01:58:21.388 --> 01:58:27.953]  And what it tells us is that on the 4th day, which was 2020, the Egyptian slave owners
[01:58:30.898 --> 01:58:34.620]  Not Pharaoh's army, but the slave owners banded together.
[01:58:34.620 --> 01:58:36.762]  There were about 700,000 of them.
[01:58:36.762 --> 01:58:43.866]  And they set out to overtake Israel in the wilderness and to force them back into servitude.
[01:58:43.866 --> 01:58:48.428]  And they overtook them on... They arrived at the end of the fourth day.
[01:58:48.428 --> 01:58:59.555]  And on the fifth day, which is this year, God strengthened the hand of Israel to fight against those slave owners and overcome them.
[01:59:00.057 --> 01:59:10.002]  And kill many of them, and sent the rest humiliated back to Pharaoh, and that's what triggered Pharaoh to then send his whole army out a couple of days later.
[01:59:10.002 --> 01:59:14.665]  So, the important thing to note there, this is the fifth year.
[01:59:14.665 --> 01:59:16.445]  This is the fifth day.
[01:59:16.445 --> 01:59:25.370]  And when you map a year to a day, the first six months of the year correspond to the nighttime portion, because the day runs from sunset to sunset.
[01:59:25.370 --> 01:59:29.112]  And the last six months correspond to the daytime portion.
[01:59:29.884 --> 01:59:36.265]  Now, we just started the 5th month of the year yesterday, or the day before.
[01:59:36.265 --> 01:59:46.548]  So, the turning point, when we hit the daylight portion of this 5th day, starts in around September 9th.
[01:59:46.548 --> 01:59:55.730]  And there is coming an inflection point when God is going to strengthen the hand of Israel to overcome this, at least within the USA.
[01:59:56.323 --> 01:59:58.485]  Maybe not Canada, not elsewhere.
[01:59:58.485 --> 02:00:03.749]  This is specific to the tribe of the USA.
[02:00:03.749 --> 02:00:15.617]  And they're the internal traitors, the CCP loyalists, and those that have come against us to bring us back into slavery starting last year.
[02:00:15.617 --> 02:00:22.923]  And you know, the lockdowns began right at the New Year, the biblical New Year, which is right around the middle of March, usually.
[02:00:24.730 --> 02:00:25.490]  Right on time.
[02:00:25.490 --> 02:00:26.911]  The time cues are all there.
[02:00:26.911 --> 02:00:29.373]  We can know what is going to happen.
[02:00:29.373 --> 02:00:30.454]  Well, that's what's amazing.
[02:00:30.454 --> 02:00:35.858]  Whether you believe in the Old Testament or not, the globalists follow it and they manifest it.
[02:00:35.858 --> 02:00:39.960]  World government, cashless society, mark of the beast.
[02:00:39.960 --> 02:00:42.983]  The Bible says there'll be three major regions, ten kingdoms.
[02:00:42.983 --> 02:00:45.524]  The UN sets up three regions, ten kingdoms.
[02:00:45.524 --> 02:00:49.227]  They're following it!
[02:00:49.227 --> 02:00:53.210]  And that actually brings me to another strong point.
[02:00:53.766 --> 02:01:00.510]  In Daniel chapter 7, the four beasts, you know, the scholars would tell us that, oh, that's just ancient history, but it's not.
[02:01:00.510 --> 02:01:20.223]  And Daniel tells us it's not, because he tells us in verses 11 and 12 that when Christ comes back, the fourth beast is slain and given to the flames, but the first three beasts are kept alive, their dominions are taken away, but they go on into the millennium for a season at a time.
[02:01:20.223 --> 02:01:21.464]  So we know
[02:01:22.944 --> 02:01:23.364]  Alright, brother.
[02:01:23.364 --> 02:01:23.965]  We'll be right back.
[02:01:23.965 --> 02:01:24.485]  Thank you.
[02:01:52.305 --> 02:01:56.088]  Alex Jones here with two big announcements in the next 60 seconds.
[02:01:56.088 --> 02:01:58.570]  First off, green fiber capsules.
[02:01:58.570 --> 02:02:03.433]  Highest quality fiber you're going to find with all the amino acids and a ton of vitamins and minerals.
[02:02:03.433 --> 02:02:04.934]  This is an incredible formula.
[02:02:04.934 --> 02:02:06.355]  Everybody should be taking it.
[02:02:06.355 --> 02:02:09.177]  Men, women, children, old, young, black, white, it doesn't matter.
[02:02:09.177 --> 02:02:10.478]  It's an amazing product.
[02:02:10.478 --> 02:02:11.299]  It's our newest product.
[02:02:11.639 --> 02:02:14.922]  It's 50% off, out of the gates, at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:02:14.922 --> 02:02:16.583]  Then we have both types of X2.
[02:02:16.583 --> 02:02:23.528]  It's the exact same X2 as the model, but one has a spray cap, one has a dropper cap, for 60% and 40% off, depending on which one.
[02:02:23.528 --> 02:02:25.670]  They're both excellent at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:02:25.670 --> 02:02:32.215]  The 60% off of the spray bottle is unprecedented, but I want you to experience the power of the good halogen and learn about the iodine.
[02:02:32.615 --> 02:02:33.395]  Conspiracy.
[02:02:33.395 --> 02:02:35.656]  It's all available at InfoWarStore.com.
[02:02:35.656 --> 02:02:43.999]  The new green fiber capsules, 50% off, and X2 in the spray bottle and in the dropper bottle for 60 and 40% off.
[02:02:43.999 --> 02:02:45.440]  And it funds the InfoWar.
[02:02:45.440 --> 02:02:50.402]  Experience Deep Earth Crystal Iodine for itself and keep your gut healthy at InfoWarStore.com.
[02:02:58.997 --> 02:03:00.500]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:03:00.500 --> 02:03:03.166]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:03:09.236 --> 02:03:12.137]  All right, I want to get her back up sometime to co-host the whole show with me.
[02:03:12.137 --> 02:03:15.119]  She's an amazing author and talks to hosts in her own right.
[02:03:15.119 --> 02:03:17.620]  Bottom of the hour, we'll go back to your calls, folks.
[02:03:17.620 --> 02:03:24.643]  Melissa Tate is a Christian conservative author, activist, political commentator, and social media influencer born and raised in Africa.
[02:03:24.643 --> 02:03:33.847]  Melissa came to the United States at the age of 19 to attend college where she earned a degree in business administration after working at a large bank for years as an investment advisor.
[02:03:33.847 --> 02:03:34.908]  Melissa started her own business
[02:03:35.328 --> 02:03:39.995]  By the age of 27, she had a thriving small business with several employees.
[02:03:39.995 --> 02:03:43.281]  She's married to her college sweetheart today, is a mother of three.
[02:03:43.281 --> 02:03:45.724]  RealMelissaTate.com.
[02:03:45.724 --> 02:03:47.828]  And the book is Choice.
[02:03:49.153 --> 02:03:50.794]  Next out, privilege.
[02:03:50.794 --> 02:03:52.234]  Choice white privilege.
[02:03:52.234 --> 02:03:53.774]  What's race got to do with it?
[02:03:53.774 --> 02:03:57.836]  And she's here with us to talk about all the craziness happening in the world.
[02:03:57.836 --> 02:04:00.116]  And I know she's been a big defender of free speech.
[02:04:00.116 --> 02:04:01.277]  She's been speaking out.
[02:04:01.277 --> 02:04:02.997]  I've been a big fan of hers for several years.
[02:04:02.997 --> 02:04:03.878]  I've known about her.
[02:04:03.878 --> 02:04:05.358]  And it's just really great to have you here.
[02:04:05.358 --> 02:04:08.099]  There's so many questions I've got, but wow, what a time to be alive.
[02:04:09.389 --> 02:04:11.429]  Well, thank you so much for having me, Alex.
[02:04:11.429 --> 02:04:14.710]  Yeah, everything that's happening is just really surreal.
[02:04:14.710 --> 02:04:20.851]  Just watching everything that's taking place has just been absolutely surreal.
[02:04:20.851 --> 02:04:29.013]  I mean, I used to watch some of your videos and I used to think, well, I think Alex is going a little too far, but I don't think he went far enough.
[02:04:29.013 --> 02:04:30.533]  It's just been so crazy.
[02:04:30.533 --> 02:04:37.215]  I just feel like I've woken up in like Twilight Zone or some sort of a dystopic movie.
[02:04:37.215 --> 02:04:38.935]  But yeah, it's been crazy.
[02:04:40.007 --> 02:04:41.227]  How did you wake up?
[02:04:41.227 --> 02:04:43.328]  Because you've reached millions of people now.
[02:04:43.328 --> 02:04:44.929]  You've got a best-selling book.
[02:04:44.929 --> 02:04:47.149]  I mean, what was your process of waking up?
[02:04:47.149 --> 02:04:49.830]  What formed your views?
[02:04:49.830 --> 02:04:58.233]  So when I moved to the United States, immediately I aligned with the Republican Party because, you know, Zimbabweans are very conservative.
[02:04:58.233 --> 02:05:01.574]  I was raised very Christian, very conservative, very traditional.
[02:05:02.435 --> 02:05:06.098]  So when I moved here, I automatically said, well, I guess I'm a Republican.
[02:05:06.098 --> 02:05:09.440]  So I was all for George Bush and all of that.
[02:05:09.440 --> 02:05:17.006]  And then I kind of started to notice that both parties, cause I've always been very, um, you know, interested in politics, but not involved.
[02:05:17.006 --> 02:05:19.388]  So I just always used to kind of follow, follow it.
[02:05:19.388 --> 02:05:30.636]  And then, uh, during the Tea Party movement, I started to notice that there was like, you know, a division between like the Republicans that are really for the people and then the Republicans that are just kind of more establishment.
[02:05:31.076 --> 02:05:33.218]  So that's when I think I started to wake up.
[02:05:33.218 --> 02:05:41.344]  And then I actually saw one of your documentaries, The Obama Deception, and that kind of opened up my mind to other issues and stuff.
[02:05:41.344 --> 02:05:42.785]  So I was like, oh, wow.
[02:05:42.785 --> 02:05:45.187]  So that that was kind of my journey in waking up.
[02:05:45.187 --> 02:05:50.992]  But really, I had kind of checked out of politics for the most part, because I just felt like both parties were corrupt.
[02:05:51.818 --> 02:05:56.382]  And then 2016, I mean, 2016 is when I got excited.
[02:05:56.382 --> 02:06:03.569]  I mean, I wasn't immediately on the Trump train, but when Trump started going, I was like, that's the guy who's going to take down, you know, both parties.
[02:06:03.569 --> 02:06:05.931]  He's going to take on the Republican establishment.
[02:06:05.931 --> 02:06:09.475]  He's going to take on the Democrat establishment, and most importantly, the media.
[02:06:10.143 --> 02:06:16.724]  So I immediately got on the Trump train and then I would hear that Trump tweeted this, Trump tweeted that.
[02:06:16.724 --> 02:06:20.085]  So I was like, let me get on this Twitter to see what he's saying for myself.
[02:06:20.085 --> 02:06:23.306]  So I logged on to Twitter, created an account.
[02:06:23.306 --> 02:06:26.366]  I started to connect with other conservatives on Twitter.
[02:06:26.366 --> 02:06:35.488]  And then I started tweeting out my own thoughts and, you know, posting, just basically being a digital warrior and exposing all the lies that the media was saying about Trump.
[02:06:36.088 --> 02:06:38.409]  And then I started growing a really big following.
[02:06:38.409 --> 02:06:41.550]  So before you knew it, I had like hundreds of thousands of followers.
[02:06:41.550 --> 02:06:43.791]  President Trump is retweeting me.
[02:06:43.791 --> 02:06:48.373]  And before you know it, I'm at the White House taking a selfie with the President of the United States.
[02:06:48.373 --> 02:06:57.377]  So if you would have told me that when I was a little girl growing up in Zimbabwe, that I'd be at the White House taking a selfie with the President of the United States, I would have said, that's fake news.
[02:06:58.607 --> 02:07:05.472]  So it's been an incredible journey, but yeah, so that's kind of my story as far as how I got involved.
[02:07:05.472 --> 02:07:07.533]  Melissa, you just said it all.
[02:07:07.533 --> 02:07:11.316]  You would have had those talents in Zimbabwe, but you wouldn't have had the opportunities.
[02:07:11.316 --> 02:07:13.657]  It's that it's not that America gave you this.
[02:07:13.657 --> 02:07:15.559]  You came to a place where you would be recognized.
[02:07:15.559 --> 02:07:18.921]  And then when you got here, people immediately recognized you're smart.
[02:07:19.505 --> 02:07:20.365]  You're well-spoken.
[02:07:20.365 --> 02:07:21.146]  You're beautiful.
[02:07:21.146 --> 02:07:21.766]  We love you.
[02:07:21.766 --> 02:07:30.131]  And that's what scares the left is they want to try to make us all at each other's throats when we're all just ready to come together and be successful and love God and justice.
[02:07:30.131 --> 02:07:32.052]  And that's why they that's why they try to suppress you.
[02:07:32.052 --> 02:07:32.972]  But you're right.
[02:07:32.972 --> 02:07:39.175]  How many other amazing people are there like you of every race, color and creed are all human that we don't know about?
[02:07:39.175 --> 02:07:40.336]  That's what's so amazing.
[02:07:40.336 --> 02:07:43.978]  I'm just glad you stepped up so we get to know you.
[02:07:45.447 --> 02:07:47.448]  Well Alex, you're absolutely right.
[02:07:47.448 --> 02:07:52.830]  So when I came to the United States, you know, this was like a great opportunity for me.
[02:07:52.830 --> 02:08:04.196]  And just coming here with nothing, $300 in my pocket, a suitcase full of clothes, I arrive in the United States, I work hard, determination, that's just what my mother taught me, you know.
[02:08:04.196 --> 02:08:06.177]  So I worked my way through college.
[02:08:06.177 --> 02:08:11.159]  It was a supernatural thing because actually when I came to the United States, it was during a time that
[02:08:11.719 --> 02:08:18.461]  My own country was having an economic collapse of devastating proportions, and I'm sure you know a lot about that.
[02:08:18.461 --> 02:08:29.665]  But, so obviously my mom couldn't afford to send me to the United States, but I came here by faith, because my mom believed that I would be able to work hard, and God would supernaturally provide, and He did!
[02:08:29.665 --> 02:08:35.067]  And I was able to pay my way through college, I graduated, I got a good job.
[02:08:36.234 --> 02:08:42.917]  I started my own business, and by the time I was 27 years old, I had a business that was doing seven figures.
[02:08:42.917 --> 02:08:46.259]  You know, I had multiple employees living the American dream.
[02:08:46.259 --> 02:08:55.283]  So when I start to hear this narrative that America is systemically racist and oppressive and evil and white supremacist, I'm like, that is not true.
[02:08:55.283 --> 02:08:57.044]  That is not the America that I know.
[02:08:57.044 --> 02:08:57.944]  That is not
[02:08:58.104 --> 02:08:59.465]  I mean, let me imagine.
[02:08:59.465 --> 02:09:04.747]  I bet you have to beat people up with a stick just for business, everything, because you're a smart, dynamic, beautiful woman.
[02:09:04.747 --> 02:09:05.408]  Exactly.
[02:09:05.408 --> 02:09:08.830]  Like, this idea is just not true, is it?
[02:09:08.830 --> 02:09:10.390]  No, it's absolutely not true.
[02:09:10.390 --> 02:09:13.192]  And that's, you know, it really grieved my heart.
[02:09:13.192 --> 02:09:18.835]  And during the time, 2020 is where I feel like it was a turning point.
[02:09:18.835 --> 02:09:27.319]  You know, during the George Floyd tragedy that happened and then the ensuing riots and all of this stuff, you know how the left just took advantage of that.
[02:09:28.119 --> 02:09:28.760]  We're good to go.
[02:09:43.446 --> 02:09:44.627]  Academia.
[02:09:44.627 --> 02:09:49.829]  But for the first time I was starting to hear my friends and family parrot these talking points of systemic racism.
[02:09:49.829 --> 02:09:57.232]  And for me what it is is a bunch of weird white academic liberals stealing black people's identity and claiming they represent any problems you have.
[02:09:57.232 --> 02:10:01.194]  Look at these weird-ass white people worshipping George Floyd.
[02:10:01.194 --> 02:10:01.734]  That's a cult!
[02:10:02.771 --> 02:10:03.712]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:10:03.712 --> 02:10:10.417]  And that's the thing, you know, it's mostly driven by white people, the white liberals, you know, that drive this.
[02:10:10.417 --> 02:10:17.902]  And so when all this started happening, I just got so frustrated just seeing all the ignorance that was around me.
[02:10:17.902 --> 02:10:24.407]  My pastor started putting up Black Lives Matter decals on the windows of the church, apologizing for his white privilege.
[02:10:24.967 --> 02:10:29.011]  I mean, it just blew my mind, and I got so frustrated.
[02:10:29.011 --> 02:10:35.517]  And that's when I, you know, in my frustration, the Lord just spoke to me and said, write a book about it and educate people.
[02:10:35.517 --> 02:10:44.465]  Because, you know, I'm somebody who follows politics very closely, so I know Black Lives Matter is an organization that does nothing for black people.
[02:10:44.465 --> 02:10:46.727]  I mean, they do very little, if anything.
[02:10:46.727 --> 02:10:50.991]  I mean, this is an organization that mostly raises funds for, you know, far left
[02:10:51.871 --> 02:10:52.972]  I don't think so.
[02:11:09.156 --> 02:11:17.958]  So I was like, you know what, I need to educate particularly, you know, even Christians and conservatives because, you know, they were falling for this and they're thinking, oh, well, I need to help black people.
[02:11:17.958 --> 02:11:22.278]  I even had people call me, oh, how do you feel about George Floyd's death?
[02:11:22.278 --> 02:11:23.158]  How does that affect you?
[02:11:23.158 --> 02:11:26.319]  I'm like, you know, that doesn't affect me.
[02:11:26.319 --> 02:11:27.339]  That's not who I am.
[02:11:27.339 --> 02:11:28.899]  That's not who my children are.
[02:11:28.899 --> 02:11:32.640]  That's not how I raise my children to live their lives like that.
[02:11:32.640 --> 02:11:37.681]  And to me, it's kind of patronizing for somebody to say that because somebody who's black was killed
[02:11:38.161 --> 02:11:41.943]  Who was in this situation, now I should feel that same way.
[02:11:41.943 --> 02:11:46.226]  And it's mostly, you know, white liberals who come up and say these kinds of things.
[02:11:46.226 --> 02:11:48.547]  So I thought, you know what, I need to write a book about this.
[02:11:48.547 --> 02:11:49.087]  So I did.
[02:11:49.087 --> 02:11:51.569]  So I wrote the book Choice Privilege.
[02:11:51.569 --> 02:11:53.910]  And basically it's a play on the words white privilege.
[02:11:53.910 --> 02:12:05.617]  I cross out where it says white and I put in choice because in my experience and what I've seen in America, it's not the color of your skin that determines your destiny and the quality of your life.
[02:12:05.617 --> 02:12:07.178]  It is the choices that you make.
[02:12:07.658 --> 02:12:08.879]  I came here with nothing.
[02:12:08.879 --> 02:12:19.810]  I made really good choices because my mother instilled in me values that the choices that you make is really what's going to determine your destiny and your life.
[02:12:19.810 --> 02:12:22.653]  So that's just the attitude I came over here with.
[02:12:22.653 --> 02:12:25.556]  My mother was like, you know, the world doesn't owe you anything.
[02:12:26.676 --> 02:12:29.837]  Well, Melissa Tate, I'm sold, and your book's amazing.
[02:12:29.837 --> 02:12:40.600]  Let's come back and look at what's contemporarily happening and your ideas on how to fix it and how to bring people together, because what you're doing is amazing for an ambassadory humanity of real unity, not division.
[02:12:40.600 --> 02:12:43.760]  We'll be right back with the author of Choice Privilege.
[02:12:43.760 --> 02:12:44.200]  Stay with us.
[02:12:44.200 --> 02:12:45.961]  Melissa Tate is on fire.
[02:12:51.847 --> 02:12:55.590]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[02:12:55.590 --> 02:12:58.753]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years and only the last year or so have I said that.
[02:12:59.306 --> 02:13:02.567]  But let me tell you, the New World Order is breathing down our neck.
[02:13:02.567 --> 02:13:06.948]  The big globalist publications are coming after us, and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[02:13:06.948 --> 02:13:12.709]  So please pray to keep InfoWars on the air, and please support the local station you're listening to as well.
[02:13:12.709 --> 02:13:24.311]  At the same time, go to InfoWarsStore.com while you still can, and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt, get some supplements, because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing.
[02:13:24.931 --> 02:13:27.072]  I need your help more than ever now.
[02:13:27.072 --> 02:13:31.173]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[02:13:31.173 --> 02:13:41.777]  So, pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast, however you can, and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:13:41.777 --> 02:13:51.321]  Whether it's high-quality coffee, or supplements, or books or films, all of it nurtures the soul, all of it empowers humanity, all of it is pro-human and pro-God.
[02:13:51.321 --> 02:13:51.981]  Thank you so much.
[02:13:52.701 --> 02:14:05.565]  So, we have free shipping, double Patriot points through this weekend and our big loss leader is X2 in the dropper and in the spray bottle for 40 and 60 percent off and your purchase funds the M4.
[02:14:05.565 --> 02:14:10.887]  But seriously, the UN admits two plus billion people have cognitive disabilities because of lack of iodine.
[02:14:10.887 --> 02:14:12.667]  You need to experience it for yourself.
[02:14:12.667 --> 02:14:14.568]  Takes two weeks to a month to kick in.
[02:14:14.568 --> 02:14:15.808]  Try it and tell me what you think.
[02:14:15.808 --> 02:14:16.949]  You can't lose your fund in the M4.
[02:14:17.609 --> 02:14:30.618]  And again, I can harp on this all day, but just like our information is dead on from research, I'm telling you, I couldn't do what I do without Deep Earth Crystal Iodine and X2.
[02:14:30.618 --> 02:14:33.600]  Just in the stamina and mental focus area, it's incredible.
[02:14:34.100 --> 02:14:36.382]  What it did for libido is incredible.
[02:14:36.382 --> 02:14:38.403]  When I don't take it, I feel the difference.
[02:14:38.403 --> 02:14:40.304]  When I do take it, I'm so empowered.
[02:14:40.304 --> 02:14:41.745]  Get your Exu today.
[02:14:41.745 --> 02:14:45.307]  Discounted in the spray bottle and in the eyedropper bottle.

[02:14:47.769 --> 02:14:55.073]  The globalists hope you don't explore how incredibly powerful Deep Earth Crystal Iodine is.
[02:14:55.073 --> 02:14:57.715]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:15:07.521 --> 02:15:31.562]  Don't know much about history Don't know much biology Don't know much about a science book Don't know much about the French I took But I do know that I love you And I know that if you loved me too What a wonderful world this would be
[02:15:33.723 --> 02:15:37.466]  Don't know much about geography.
[02:15:37.466 --> 02:15:41.190]  Don't know much trigonometry.
[02:15:41.190 --> 02:15:43.352]  Don't know much about algebra.
[02:15:43.352 --> 02:15:48.716]  Don't know what a slide rule is for.
[02:15:48.716 --> 02:15:52.600]  But I do know one and one is two.
[02:15:52.600 --> 02:15:57.785]  And if this was to be with you, what a wonderful world this would be.
[02:15:58.817 --> 02:16:06.742]  Now I don't claim to be an A student, but I'm trying to be.
[02:16:06.742 --> 02:16:13.087]  For maybe by being an A student, baby, I can win your love.
[02:16:13.087 --> 02:16:15.328]  Melissa Tate's our guest.
[02:16:15.328 --> 02:16:18.671]  Hard to turn this great song off.
[02:16:18.671 --> 02:16:23.574]  So, looking at the clear, cold-blooded attempt to create division in this country,
[02:16:24.632 --> 02:16:25.873]  You're a world-traveled person.
[02:16:25.873 --> 02:16:27.414]  You're a successful person in your own right.
[02:16:27.414 --> 02:16:28.694]  That's what I respect.
[02:16:28.694 --> 02:16:29.595]  I want your advice.
[02:16:29.595 --> 02:16:30.895]  What do you say to America?
[02:16:30.895 --> 02:16:32.256]  How do we fix this?
[02:16:32.256 --> 02:16:33.617]  How do we stop the Democrats?
[02:16:33.617 --> 02:16:47.084]  I mean, I think get the Republicans strong and to stop being on defense when we get called racist because we're just promoting freedom and really getting the Democrats faced with what they're doing because promoting racial division is the racism in my view.
[02:16:48.969 --> 02:16:50.471]  No, you're absolutely right.
[02:16:50.471 --> 02:16:54.897]  And the answer is really for people to start being politically active.
[02:16:54.897 --> 02:16:59.523]  You know, just sitting around in the sidelines doesn't work anymore.
[02:16:59.523 --> 02:17:01.786]  Politics is no longer a spectator sport.
[02:17:01.786 --> 02:17:03.409]  It has to be all hands on deck.
[02:17:03.909 --> 02:17:07.571]  That means every person needs to be figuring out, what do I need to do?
[02:17:07.571 --> 02:17:08.372]  What can I do?
[02:17:08.372 --> 02:17:12.534]  And that's the question that I was asking myself when everything was happening.
[02:17:12.534 --> 02:17:14.355]  I was like, what can I do?
[02:17:14.355 --> 02:17:16.296]  And that's what prompted me to write the book.
[02:17:16.296 --> 02:17:17.377]  I was like, let me write a book.
[02:17:17.377 --> 02:17:18.477]  Let me get out there.
[02:17:18.477 --> 02:17:19.438]  Let me do something.
[02:17:19.438 --> 02:17:24.321]  But for everybody, it's going to look different on what God has called them to do in this fight.
[02:17:25.041 --> 02:17:27.904]  So everybody has to start being politically active.
[02:17:27.904 --> 02:17:34.171]  People have to stop being afraid of being called names, you know, whatever racist names, whatever names that the...
[02:17:35.052 --> 02:17:39.674]  Left is going to throw at you racists, white supremacists, all these things.
[02:17:39.674 --> 02:17:42.295]  We have to stop being afraid of being called names.
[02:17:42.295 --> 02:17:55.942]  We have to stop being afraid of cancel culture, because really, if everything they're trying to achieve happens, the consequences of that are going to be ten times worse than what it is for you to be canceled, or for you to be called names.
[02:17:55.942 --> 02:18:00.144]  I get called names all the time, but it doesn't stop me from speaking the truth.
[02:18:00.784 --> 02:18:02.805]  Let me just say this, Melissa.
[02:18:02.805 --> 02:18:06.988]  It's not just that you're a beautiful woman and a mother and married and so successful.
[02:18:06.988 --> 02:18:12.851]  The fact that you came from adversity, overcame adversity, I wouldn't call that sexy.
[02:18:12.851 --> 02:18:15.672]  It's not like a sexual thing.
[02:18:15.672 --> 02:18:17.073]  It's very attractive.
[02:18:17.840 --> 02:18:20.802]  You're like an American success story.
[02:18:20.802 --> 02:18:22.423]  Just like anything America.
[02:18:22.423 --> 02:18:27.586]  Like some poor guy grows up wherever ends up being a top race car driver by his own bootstraps.
[02:18:27.586 --> 02:18:29.668]  He can be black, Hispanic, white, I don't care.
[02:18:29.668 --> 02:18:31.709]  It's like attractive.
[02:18:31.709 --> 02:18:37.493]  And I look at you, the Democratic Party could easily be full of great dynamic people like you, but they don't want that.
[02:18:37.493 --> 02:18:40.655]  They want AOC people that are repulsive.
[02:18:40.655 --> 02:18:41.756]  Not because she's Hispanic.
[02:18:41.756 --> 02:18:43.016]  Beautiful Hispanic people.
[02:18:43.016 --> 02:18:44.637]  She's just something.
[02:18:44.637 --> 02:18:46.298]  Joe Biden's repulsive.
[02:18:48.960 --> 02:18:50.281]  It seems spiritual.
[02:18:50.281 --> 02:18:53.423]  Why can't people see the difference?
[02:18:53.423 --> 02:18:54.523]  No, you're absolutely right.
[02:18:54.523 --> 02:18:56.804]  And the Democrat Party doesn't want that.
[02:18:56.804 --> 02:19:08.351]  And really, I mean, the way we've been looking at this whole issue with the race and the critical race theory, we've been looking at it from the standpoint of what it's doing to the country, which is evil in itself.
[02:19:08.351 --> 02:19:10.592]  But what is it doing to the black community?
[02:19:10.592 --> 02:19:15.155]  Really, what it's doing, it's designed to demoralize the black community as well.
[02:19:15.575 --> 02:19:28.419]  Because if you're born and the first thing you're told is that you live in this oppressive society where the white man is out to get you, you're never going to succeed, you're never going to achieve anything, you're never going to amount to anything because you don't have privilege.
[02:19:28.419 --> 02:19:30.539]  And these people here have privilege.
[02:19:30.539 --> 02:19:35.781]  So really, when I look at critical race theory, I look at it as the black demoralization project.
[02:19:36.281 --> 02:19:50.636]  That is the new project of the Democrat Party to destroy the black community and then weaponize the black community to destroy and take down America, basically American principles and Western civilization.
[02:19:50.636 --> 02:19:58.824]  And this is what I've seen just studying it for my book, just the fact that critical race theory and this whole racial agenda, it is really designed
[02:19:59.463 --> 02:20:05.388]  To tear down Western civilization, if you just boil it all the way down, and that's what's happening.
[02:20:05.388 --> 02:20:16.978]  So at the same time that they're destroying the country, they're destroying the black community because they're totally demoralizing them, telling them they can never amount to anything because of racism and white supremacy.
[02:20:17.738 --> 02:20:27.983]  I came here and I succeeded because my mother told me that I could become anything and everything I want to be if I'm willing to work hard and make good choices.
[02:20:27.983 --> 02:20:34.086]  And that was a simple formula that I used and I came to the United States and I was able to make it.
[02:20:34.086 --> 02:20:38.508]  And that's one thing that is very unique about the United States is you can come here with nothing
[02:20:39.088 --> 02:20:47.972]  And you can have the determination and the work ethic, and you can have, you know, all these things that are innate in you, and you can become something.
[02:20:47.972 --> 02:21:00.677]  And that's very unique to the United States, because I could have had the same determination and hard work ethic in my country, and I never would have been as successful there as I am here, because they're very rigid.
[02:21:00.677 --> 02:21:02.678]  The class systems there are very rigid.
[02:21:02.678 --> 02:21:03.538]  Well, exactly.
[02:21:09.332 --> 02:21:11.473]  You're most likely going to die poor.
[02:21:11.473 --> 02:21:33.548]  So, America is very unique and I just wish Americans understood that and I wish that Americans would appreciate America because it is such a beacon of light and hope and freedom for the rest of the world and people who are able to make it here are just like, wow, what an opportunity that I can come here and make something of myself.
[02:21:34.108 --> 02:21:48.775]  And you have a line of people that want to come here and become something, and then you see Americans, you know, kneeling for the flag, turning their back on the national anthem, and all these things, and it's just unbelievable.
[02:21:48.775 --> 02:21:53.298]  Because, yeah, so it's just crazy.
[02:21:53.298 --> 02:22:01.182]  You know, to me, what's amazing is that these big corporations are hiding their corruption, their death camps in China.
[02:22:02.859 --> 02:22:05.581]  By funding Black Lives Matter and it's so transparent.
[02:22:05.581 --> 02:22:17.848]  I'm seeing polls that not just white America or black America, but everybody is rejecting BLM now and really seeing it's just a corporations trying to hide themselves between a black face.
[02:22:17.848 --> 02:22:18.629]  That's what I see happening.
[02:22:19.714 --> 02:22:20.835]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:22:20.835 --> 02:22:24.417]  And black people are starting to wake up to Black Lives Matter as well.
[02:22:24.417 --> 02:22:29.521]  You know, you saw the founder of Black Lives Matter just bought a whole bunch of million-dollar houses.
[02:22:29.521 --> 02:22:33.784]  You know, they're just blowing living large and nothing has happened for the black community.
[02:22:33.784 --> 02:22:42.370]  All the communities that they have destroyed and looted are still laying in ruins while they're living high on the hog, buying all these fancy houses.
[02:22:42.370 --> 02:22:46.092]  And then there's another gentleman that was talking about education.
[02:22:46.092 --> 02:22:48.494]  He was part of the Black Lives Matter organization.
[02:22:49.034 --> 02:23:00.901]  And then he went after education, which is the one thing you don't want to go after when you're in the Democrat Party, because they want you to criticize the system, but they don't want you to exit it.
[02:23:01.460 --> 02:23:09.687]  So they will let you criticize the white supremacist system or whatever, but if anyone stands up and says, well, we need to exit the school system.
[02:23:09.687 --> 02:23:12.490]  We need to exit the white supremacist school system.
[02:23:12.490 --> 02:23:14.091]  That's what he basically said.
[02:23:14.091 --> 02:23:17.074]  And you know that's the teacher's unions and that's where it is.
[02:23:17.074 --> 02:23:23.600]  Which, by the way, is based on eugenics and Planned Parenthood, which basically is about the only white supremacist thing in this country that's left.
[02:23:24.793 --> 02:23:36.216]  Right, absolutely, and that is so true because right now the one thing that is keeping black people down is the school system because you have... Let's talk about that with Melissa Tate.
[02:23:36.216 --> 02:23:37.777]  She'll be gone after this segment.
[02:23:37.777 --> 02:23:39.797]  We'll go to your calls, but I could have her on for 10 hours.
[02:23:39.797 --> 02:23:40.778]  Melissa Tate.

[02:23:53.351 --> 02:23:55.433]  Your voice counts.

[02:24:00.497 --> 02:24:03.080]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[02:24:03.080 --> 02:24:04.581]  They know you're angry.
[02:24:04.581 --> 02:24:09.986]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.

[02:25:01.954 --> 02:25:06.715]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date.
[02:25:06.715 --> 02:25:09.036]  Super Male Vitality!

[02:25:29.042 --> 02:25:29.262]  Yes!
[02:25:29.582 --> 02:25:31.784]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021.
[02:25:56.005 --> 02:25:57.105]  And I just want to say something.
[02:25:57.105 --> 02:26:01.886]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over the years.
[02:26:01.886 --> 02:26:06.807]  It is truly an answer to prayer, and I am so blessed and thankful for all of you, the listeners of this show.
[02:26:06.807 --> 02:26:09.708]  I want you to know that I love you, and I appreciate you.
[02:26:09.708 --> 02:26:13.069]  Whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter.
[02:26:13.069 --> 02:26:14.289]  You've got red blood.
[02:26:14.289 --> 02:26:24.051]  And if you love freedom and justice, and if you love our innocent children, we are brothers and sisters together, and it has just been an incredible experience to work with you over the years.
[02:26:24.751 --> 02:26:28.614]  And as crazy as things are, I want to keep working into the future.
[02:26:28.614 --> 02:26:31.497]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[02:26:31.497 --> 02:26:36.761]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us.
[02:26:36.761 --> 02:26:38.982]  But again, that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[02:26:38.982 --> 02:26:43.426]  I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've done.
[02:26:43.426 --> 02:26:47.549]  And just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you.
[02:26:47.549 --> 02:26:50.511]  And hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support InfoHorse.
[02:26:50.511 --> 02:26:50.892]  God bless.
[02:26:55.146 --> 02:26:56.407]  Jacob in Ohio.
[02:26:56.407 --> 02:26:56.788]  Welcome.
[02:26:56.788 --> 02:26:57.228]  Go ahead.
[02:26:57.228 --> 02:26:59.090]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[02:26:59.090 --> 02:27:00.191]  Great last caller.
[02:27:00.191 --> 02:27:03.254]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[02:27:03.254 --> 02:27:08.960]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, demoralization, and absurdity.
[02:27:08.960 --> 02:27:11.042]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone, man.
[02:27:11.042 --> 02:27:11.503]  All right.
[02:27:11.503 --> 02:27:12.764]  Eric in New Hampshire.
[02:27:12.764 --> 02:27:13.685]  Eric, thanks for calling.
[02:27:13.685 --> 02:27:13.985]  Go ahead.
[02:27:14.065 --> 02:27:15.587]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:27:15.587 --> 02:27:18.631]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for the point of the product.
[02:27:18.631 --> 02:27:20.292]  The X Team does wonders.
[02:27:20.292 --> 02:27:21.434]  I recommend it to everybody.
[02:27:21.434 --> 02:27:22.615]  You're on the fence about it.
[02:27:22.615 --> 02:27:23.416]  Get off the fence.
[02:27:23.416 --> 02:27:24.297]  Get the product.
[02:27:24.297 --> 02:27:25.479]  Support the info war.
[02:27:25.479 --> 02:27:26.800]  Tyler in Maine.
[02:27:26.800 --> 02:27:27.461]  You're on the air.
[02:27:27.461 --> 02:27:27.922]  Thanks for rolling.
[02:27:27.922 --> 02:27:28.362]  Go ahead.
[02:27:28.362 --> 02:27:30.084]  Hey Alex, it's great to be on with you.
[02:27:30.084 --> 02:27:30.645]  It's an honor.
[02:27:30.865 --> 02:27:32.566]  I'm honored to talk to you.
[02:27:32.566 --> 02:27:33.006]  Awesome.
[02:27:33.006 --> 02:27:38.469]  So, first thing I wanted to do is to say I love the product, Alpha Power, even at 29.
[02:27:38.469 --> 02:27:42.311]  If you ask my better half, she loves it, and it helps in the bedroom.
[02:27:42.311 --> 02:27:43.952]  So, just number one for a few weeks.
[02:27:43.952 --> 02:27:44.973]  Well, it definitely works.
[02:27:44.973 --> 02:27:46.594]  It's not a joke.
[02:27:46.594 --> 02:27:54.598]  Absolutely.
[02:27:54.598 --> 02:27:57.220]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:28:30.396 --> 02:28:34.058]  You know, I'm sold on people like Melissa Tate.
[02:28:34.058 --> 02:28:37.599]  Because they're what America's dream is all about.
[02:28:37.599 --> 02:28:41.641]  About what you stand for is what you stand for.
[02:28:41.641 --> 02:28:44.623]  That's why everything Martin Luther King said made such sense to everybody.
[02:28:44.623 --> 02:28:50.465]  And we'd already fixed a lot of problems, but he took us over the top by just saying, I want our children to live together in the future.
[02:28:50.465 --> 02:28:53.127]  Not what color they are, but what they stand for and who they are.
[02:28:53.127 --> 02:28:53.927]  And we all know that.
[02:28:54.901 --> 02:29:00.163]  You don't go buy a suit of clothes asking whether a black person or a brown person or a white person came up with it.
[02:29:00.163 --> 02:29:01.784]  You ask, is that a good set of clothes?
[02:29:01.784 --> 02:29:06.726]  You don't go eat at a restaurant, at least I don't, saying, what color person is the chef?
[02:29:06.726 --> 02:29:08.367]  You go there because it's good food.
[02:29:08.367 --> 02:29:11.548]  You don't listen to music asking, what color is this person?
[02:29:11.548 --> 02:29:15.070]  I can hear an African player, Hispanic, Asian, white, doesn't matter.
[02:29:15.070 --> 02:29:16.771]  I can hear Eric Clapton or Jimi Hendrix.
[02:29:16.771 --> 02:29:18.832]  It's beautiful.
[02:29:18.832 --> 02:29:21.773]  And that's our humanity, our free choice.
[02:29:22.623 --> 02:29:34.050]  And people that try to set things up in the way of that and tell you in college and high school now, oh, it's not about what somebody does, it's about what color they are.
[02:29:34.050 --> 02:29:34.510]  That's evil.
[02:29:35.350 --> 02:29:37.291]  And it's done to divide us.
[02:29:37.291 --> 02:29:46.615]  So I've asked my questions, and Melissa Tate, I've been impressed with you for several years watching your work, and getting a chance to read your book last week, and I really appreciate my producer getting you on so quickly.
[02:29:46.615 --> 02:29:52.998]  I'd love to invite you back to Coho sometime, or come on for a couple hours and take calls with us, but I've been asking a lot of questions the last few segments.
[02:29:52.998 --> 02:30:03.503]  I want to give you the floor in the last eight minutes we've got to just impart other knowledge of people as a successful, beautiful person that is not black, that's not white, but is a human that God made
[02:30:04.825 --> 02:30:09.476]  And what you think we can do to transcend this globalist poison.
[02:30:11.425 --> 02:30:17.449]  Well, Alex, I mean, looking at everything that's happening right now, everything just seems so dire.
[02:30:17.449 --> 02:30:22.293]  I mean, I just look at every corner and I'm like, what is going on?
[02:30:22.293 --> 02:30:33.201]  You know, I just saw a video the other day of like a TikTok, like a teenager on TikTok, and she was giving all these pronouns on her thing and she was dressed like a ram.
[02:30:33.201 --> 02:30:36.323]  And she was saying, my pronouns are Ram, Rammy, Romo.
[02:30:36.323 --> 02:30:38.325]  And I was like, what is going on?
[02:30:38.325 --> 02:30:39.666]  I just, I just, it just hit me.
[02:30:40.346 --> 02:30:45.167]  I was like, wow, this looks so bleak right now, but let me tell you what gives me hope.
[02:30:45.167 --> 02:30:57.071]  What gives me hope is that this country was founded on a covenant between God's people with God to create this nation.
[02:30:57.071 --> 02:31:00.792]  This nation was founded on the principles, biblical principles.
[02:31:01.602 --> 02:31:07.585]  And that's what gives me hope, because I feel like the Lord is working in all of this chaos.
[02:31:07.585 --> 02:31:14.128]  You know, every other country has fallen to communism and socialism, including where I've come from, you know.
[02:31:14.128 --> 02:31:17.110]  But I feel like there's something unique about the United States.
[02:31:17.110 --> 02:31:22.973]  That covenant that the Lord made with the founders of this nation is the one thing I hold on to.
[02:31:23.593 --> 02:31:27.276]  That God is not going to allow this country to fall to communism.
[02:31:27.276 --> 02:31:41.789]  So I am seeing a great awakening that is taking place and there is a remnant of people that are awakening and starting to take action, you know, peacefully and starting to get involved and starting to do things that I feel like are going to do something.
[02:31:41.789 --> 02:31:45.872]  And right now, I mean, what we're looking at, it feels like a huge giant.
[02:31:45.872 --> 02:31:48.074]  It feels like something that is insurmountable.
[02:31:48.074 --> 02:31:49.856]  But when you read the Bible, you see that
[02:31:50.436 --> 02:31:53.720]  You know, God only needs a remnant, a small group of people.
[02:31:53.720 --> 02:31:57.065]  You know, like the Gideon Army was an army of just 300 people.
[02:31:57.065 --> 02:32:01.791]  God said, I just need 300 people to fight this army of a million people.
[02:32:01.791 --> 02:32:04.294]  And that's kind of the paradigm that we're in right now.
[02:32:06.216 --> 02:32:11.159]  I wouldn't worry about the masses and all the people that are just going along with this.
[02:32:11.159 --> 02:32:27.927]  Obviously it's wrong, but if that small group of people, those of us who are awake and aware of what's happening, start to get involved, we can really turn things around with the power of God, because we have to pray, but we also have to have corresponding action in the natural.
[02:32:27.927 --> 02:32:35.591]  So that's what gives me hope, and that's what I'm hoping that people out there who watch your show, who watch other shows, other patriots,
[02:32:35.991 --> 02:32:42.058]  We'll listen to what I'm saying and start to do certain things in their community.
[02:32:42.058 --> 02:32:43.780]  Local politics is huge.
[02:32:43.780 --> 02:32:45.222]  School boards.
[02:32:45.222 --> 02:32:52.590]  Even something as simple as getting your kids out of the public school system is something that I really talk about and I go into it in quite detail.
[02:32:53.482 --> 02:32:57.164]  In my book, because I feel like that's where we're losing the war right now.
[02:32:57.164 --> 02:32:59.104]  Because we're fighting all these battles.
[02:32:59.104 --> 02:33:02.066]  We're fighting pro-life, gun control, and all these things.
[02:33:02.066 --> 02:33:08.388]  But the left has a system right now where they have 50 million of our kids in their care.
[02:33:08.388 --> 02:33:11.690]  So you can be fighting for all these things during the day.
[02:33:11.690 --> 02:33:14.971]  But if you don't exit, like, out of Egypt, then they still got you.
[02:33:16.042 --> 02:33:19.345]  Exactly, and right now they have 50 million kids.
[02:33:19.345 --> 02:33:26.752]  So no matter what we're doing, we're just spinning our wheels because every single time they have 50 million kids that are on their conveyor belts.
[02:33:26.752 --> 02:33:30.535]  And we're just kind of just picking the little issues one issue at a time.
[02:33:30.535 --> 02:33:33.037]  So I feel like education is such a huge issue.
[02:33:33.037 --> 02:33:34.138]  So strike back at the heart.
[02:33:34.138 --> 02:33:35.459]  Take control of our families again.
[02:33:35.459 --> 02:33:36.040]  Let me ask you this.
[02:33:36.656 --> 02:33:38.820]  Because you're a really honest and energetic person.
[02:33:38.820 --> 02:33:40.342]  What is your energy like right now?
[02:33:40.342 --> 02:33:42.526]  I just feel God is really pissed off.
[02:33:42.526 --> 02:33:44.569]  I feel more energy than I've ever felt.
[02:33:44.569 --> 02:33:46.132]  It's hard to control right now.
[02:33:46.132 --> 02:33:47.835]  What are you feeling in your spirit right now?
[02:33:49.187 --> 02:33:51.488]  Well, I'm feeling very energized right now.
[02:33:51.488 --> 02:33:55.489]  It's like the best of times and the worst of times.
[02:33:55.489 --> 02:33:58.529]  You know, you're seeing like two extremes.
[02:33:58.529 --> 02:34:08.252]  You're seeing like the extremes on the left and all the craziness that's going on over there and then you're really seeing like an awakening of people on the other side.
[02:34:08.832 --> 02:34:14.915]  Well, standing up and fighting, you know, just seeing like the mama bears, you know, I feel like, okay, the mama bears are going to save the country.
[02:34:14.915 --> 02:34:20.598]  Because when you come after mothers and their children, that's when you've started a real fight.
[02:34:20.598 --> 02:34:23.239]  Because as a mother, I know how it is.
[02:34:23.239 --> 02:34:26.521]  You know, people love their children and they're going to fight for their children.
[02:34:26.521 --> 02:34:29.742]  And right now they're really coming to attack our children.
[02:34:29.742 --> 02:34:36.866]  When you see what they're doing, like with the masks and forcing kids to wear masks, forcing vaccines, you know, isolating kids.
[02:34:36.886 --> 02:34:47.815]  And the drag queen story times, and this new thing I can't even say on air, this horrible guy with like the things he did in London, that they would try to have somebody do that to children.
[02:34:47.815 --> 02:34:49.936]  These people are demonic.
[02:34:49.936 --> 02:34:51.057]  It's unbelievable.
[02:34:51.057 --> 02:34:53.779]  I showed my husband that and he couldn't believe that.
[02:34:53.779 --> 02:34:56.021]  I was actually showing him yesterday.
[02:34:56.021 --> 02:35:02.086]  I was like, this guy, you know, the rainbow monkey guy with the dildo, I could not believe it.
[02:35:02.928 --> 02:35:13.421]  I mean, for those who don't know, imagine a six-foot guy shows up with a huge fake, you know what, with a fake rear end and breast, and the women bring their kids to him like an altar.
[02:35:13.421 --> 02:35:14.923]  That's Satanism!
[02:35:14.923 --> 02:35:16.164]  I mean, it's just, it's crazy.
[02:35:16.164 --> 02:35:19.428]  I mean, it's seeing what we'll put up with.
[02:35:20.689 --> 02:35:22.791]  Yeah, and that's the worst part.
[02:35:22.791 --> 02:35:29.599]  The worst part, I mean, what's worse than that story is the fact that mothers were bringing their children to that.
[02:35:29.599 --> 02:35:34.484]  You know, it just goes to show you just how far gone some of the people are.
[02:35:34.484 --> 02:35:37.647]  But I still feel there's hope for the country.
[02:35:37.647 --> 02:35:38.969]  There's still hope for the world.
[02:35:39.529 --> 02:35:48.958]  So, I never want to give a bleak message, but, you know, again, talking about getting involved, getting our kids out of the public school system is huge.
[02:35:48.958 --> 02:36:01.409]  You know, if every patriot took their kids out of the public school system, you know, we wouldn't, the system would collapse, the public school system, and that's the indoctrination factory that is taking place right now.
[02:36:02.129 --> 02:36:06.132]  So we need to really rethink education.
[02:36:06.132 --> 02:36:13.856]  I know it's kind of a paradigm shift, because where I come from, it's very normal for a middle-class family to take their kids to private school.
[02:36:13.856 --> 02:36:15.677]  So my kids are in private school.
[02:36:15.677 --> 02:36:16.718]  That's very normal.
[02:36:16.718 --> 02:36:18.699]  But I've noticed that in the United States, like,
[02:36:19.219 --> 02:36:22.700]  Public school, people are very emotionally invested in the public school.
[02:36:22.700 --> 02:36:25.401]  Yeah, even people who have the money think it's like a good thing to do, and it's not.
[02:36:25.401 --> 02:36:26.701]  It's run by the globalists.
[02:36:26.701 --> 02:36:28.101]  Even most private schools have got problems.
[02:36:28.101 --> 02:36:35.763]  Well, all I can say is, I've known about you for years, I've read your book, and you've had a lot of courage, and I follow your work almost every day.
[02:36:35.763 --> 02:36:36.543]  I see what you're doing.
[02:36:36.543 --> 02:36:38.624]  Without even trying to follow you, I see what you're doing.
[02:36:38.624 --> 02:36:43.505]  You're a warrior, and you're just awesome, and you're an example of what we should all do.
[02:36:43.505 --> 02:36:47.286]  I don't want to praise you too much, a little tragedy platforming, but you've had a lot of courage.
[02:36:47.286 --> 02:36:48.506]  In one minute, closing comment.
[02:36:50.595 --> 02:37:03.958]  Well, my closing comment is I would like people to start being, reiterating what I was saying, we need to start being involved because right now we are facing Marxism.
[02:37:03.958 --> 02:37:06.819]  This is something that happened in my own country.
[02:37:06.819 --> 02:37:15.081]  You know, we had the same type of situation with the racial division and that's why I was so able to quickly pick up on it when it started happening here.
[02:37:15.081 --> 02:37:18.062]  The same rhetoric that the Democrats were having
[02:37:19.202 --> 02:37:25.830]  I started to see the same thing happen here that was happening in my country preceding to the collapse.
[02:37:25.830 --> 02:37:31.337]  And for those of you who don't know, in Zimbabwe we had the worst economic collapse probably in history.
[02:37:31.337 --> 02:37:34.441]  I think we made the Guinness Book of Records of the worst inflation.
[02:37:35.221 --> 02:37:38.802]  Hold on, I got loaded phone lines, but I'm going to host to the next hour.
[02:37:38.802 --> 02:37:39.923]  I'll get to everybody.
[02:37:39.923 --> 02:37:48.645]  William, Barbara, Rob, Luke, First Timer, Galv, Jerry, Boomer, I'm going to get to you, but I want to do three more minutes for you on the side, because you're from Zimbabwe.
[02:37:48.645 --> 02:37:50.406]  People that know about that, we'll come right back.
[02:37:50.766 --> 02:37:54.149]  X2 has been our number one bestseller over the years.
[02:37:54.149 --> 02:37:56.932]  Deep Earth Crystal Iodine, the good halogen.
[02:37:56.932 --> 02:37:59.814]  It is essential for all actions in the body.
[02:37:59.814 --> 02:38:01.256]  You must have it to live.
[02:38:01.256 --> 02:38:05.439]  The UN estimates 2 billion plus people have cognitive disabilities because they don't have enough iodine.
[02:38:05.439 --> 02:38:11.845]  We have X2 in two different bottles, same amount in each bottle, but one has a spray top, one has a dropper top.
[02:38:11.845 --> 02:38:12.866]  60% off on the spray top,
[02:38:13.566 --> 02:38:18.410]  40% off on the dropper top for a limited time because they're both selling out.
[02:38:18.410 --> 02:38:20.812]  I want to thank all the supporters that have gotten these over the years.
[02:38:20.812 --> 02:38:21.493]  They're amazing.
[02:38:21.493 --> 02:38:23.895]  So that's a great deal for you to stock up on it.
[02:38:23.895 --> 02:38:29.340]  But this deal is really for folks that have been on the fence and haven't experienced the good halogen for yourself.
[02:38:29.340 --> 02:38:32.442]  So, X2 in the dropper bottle and the spray bottle.
[02:38:32.442 --> 02:38:36.926]  60% and 40% off for a limited time because it's selling out right now at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:38:36.926 --> 02:38:39.168]  But we're going to keep this sale going until it sells out.
[02:38:39.168 --> 02:38:40.429]  It'll probably take about two weeks.
[02:38:40.809 --> 02:38:41.950]  Don't procrastinate.

[02:39:06.731 --> 02:39:07.671]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.

[02:39:52.057 --> 02:40:00.242]  I preach about the dangers of cell phones all day long because they're supercomputers controlled by big tech that are spying on us everywhere we go and what we do.
[02:40:00.242 --> 02:40:09.007]  But because they have great cameras and great recording systems and great ways to communicate, I still have one because this Trojan horse, this Promethean Fire, has a lot of power.
[02:40:09.007 --> 02:40:15.971]  But when I'm not using it, I lock it up in a high-quality Faraday cage, a privacy pocket, at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:40:15.971 --> 02:40:18.592]  We finally got them back in stock, the highest rated.

[02:40:21.454 --> 02:40:21.974]  I think?
[02:40:51.394 --> 02:40:55.856]  Alex Jones here with two big announcements in the next 60 seconds.
[02:40:55.856 --> 02:40:58.338]  First off, green fiber capsules.
[02:40:58.338 --> 02:41:03.200]  Highest quality fiber you're going to find with all the amino acids and a ton of vitamins and minerals.
[02:41:03.200 --> 02:41:04.701]  This is an incredible formula.
[02:41:04.701 --> 02:41:06.122]  Everybody should be taking it.
[02:41:06.122 --> 02:41:09.143]  Men, women, children, old, young, black, white, it doesn't matter.
[02:41:09.143 --> 02:41:10.244]  It's an amazing product.
[02:41:10.244 --> 02:41:11.424]  It's our newest product.
[02:41:11.424 --> 02:41:14.706]  It's 50% off, out of the gates, at foamworkstore.com.
[02:41:14.706 --> 02:41:16.227]  Then we have both types of X2.
[02:41:16.227 --> 02:41:20.309]  It's the exact same X2 in the bottle, but one has a spray cap, one has a dropper cap.
[02:41:20.569 --> 02:41:25.450]  For 60 and 40% off, depending on which one, they're both excellent at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:41:25.450 --> 02:41:33.173]  The 60% off of the spray bottle is unprecedented, but I want you to experience the power of the good halogen and learn about the iodine conspiracy.
[02:41:33.173 --> 02:41:35.433]  It's all available at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:41:35.433 --> 02:41:43.776]  The new green fiber capsules, 50% off, and X2 in the spray bottle and in the dropper bottle for 60 and 40% off.

[02:41:54.691 --> 02:42:07.017]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:42:07.017 --> 02:42:13.721]  Alright, final segment with our guest and I promise all the loaded phone calls, I'm going to and I appreciate you holding while she's been on with us.
[02:42:13.721 --> 02:42:15.542]  Melissa Tate, RealMelissaTate.com
[02:42:16.525 --> 02:42:17.666]  What a subject!
[02:42:17.666 --> 02:42:18.566]  Zimbabwe.
[02:42:18.566 --> 02:42:22.809]  You could talk about the race war of the UN, the left funded, the communists funded.
[02:42:22.809 --> 02:42:23.489]  She lived through it.
[02:42:23.489 --> 02:42:24.570]  I mean, I just read about it.
[02:42:24.570 --> 02:42:25.391]  Amazing.
[02:42:25.391 --> 02:42:26.852]  Or the trillion dollar notes.
[02:42:26.852 --> 02:42:28.853]  We could put those on screen for TV viewers.
[02:42:28.853 --> 02:42:29.994]  There's one.
[02:42:29.994 --> 02:42:31.154]  Reserve Bank Zimbabwe.
[02:42:31.154 --> 02:42:32.695]  What is that trillion dollar note?
[02:42:32.695 --> 02:42:33.576]  One trillion dollars.
[02:42:34.276 --> 02:42:36.257]  That's beyond the German Weimar Republic.
[02:42:36.257 --> 02:42:37.298]  That's where we're headed.
[02:42:37.298 --> 02:42:38.798]  So you're just intriguing.
[02:42:38.798 --> 02:42:44.822]  I could have you on for a whole show just about growing up to you were, I guess you said, a teenager in Zimbabwe.
[02:42:44.822 --> 02:42:50.144]  Spend a few minutes on that life lesson, having you see how great America was.
[02:42:50.144 --> 02:42:52.145]  Not like you were some weak person.
[02:42:52.145 --> 02:42:53.746]  Once you got here, you thrived.
[02:42:53.746 --> 02:42:55.807]  I mean, we're glad we've got you.
[02:42:55.807 --> 02:42:58.669]  So, I mean, that's our empowerment.
[02:42:58.669 --> 02:43:03.151]  But for people that don't know what it's like to live in a communist hellhole, please tell them.
[02:43:05.080 --> 02:43:09.867]  Well, um, you know, growing up in Zimbabwe, Zimbabwe was a beautiful country.
[02:43:09.867 --> 02:43:13.592]  I mean, when I grew up, it was just an amazing place to live.
[02:43:13.592 --> 02:43:14.834]  I couldn't have asked for a better place.
[02:43:14.834 --> 02:43:16.116]  They say it looks like Hawaii.
[02:43:16.116 --> 02:43:16.716]  I haven't been there.
[02:43:16.716 --> 02:43:17.658]  They say it looks like Hawaii.
[02:43:18.584 --> 02:43:27.266]  Well, it actually looks a lot like South Florida because when my husband visited us and I visited the country, he was like, man, this place looks like South Florida.
[02:43:27.266 --> 02:43:29.786]  And then the next time we went, I was like, wow, it really does.
[02:43:29.786 --> 02:43:31.187]  I mean, it's beautiful.
[02:43:31.187 --> 02:43:36.368]  And when I grew up there, you know, it's a multiracial country, very cosmopolitan.
[02:43:36.368 --> 02:43:42.809]  I went to school with people from all over the world because they say that we have the best climate and the best weather in the world.
[02:43:43.624 --> 02:43:45.505]  So it was great growing up there.
[02:43:45.505 --> 02:43:47.065]  We had a very strong currency.
[02:43:47.065 --> 02:43:52.087]  In fact, I think at one point the Zimbabwean dollar was one is to one with the British pound.
[02:43:52.087 --> 02:43:53.748]  So it was actually stronger than the U.S.
[02:43:53.748 --> 02:43:54.548]  dollar.
[02:43:54.548 --> 02:44:02.611]  So when I grew up, Zimbabwe was a very successful country and people would migrate from other neighboring countries to come to Zimbabwe.
[02:44:02.611 --> 02:44:05.952]  So you saw the whole process from a wonderland to hell?
[02:44:07.057 --> 02:44:08.258]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:44:08.258 --> 02:44:21.808]  Yeah, so people would come in from other countries for a better life in Zimbabwe and then gradually things started to change and then you just see like hyperinflation, empty shelves.
[02:44:21.808 --> 02:44:27.112]  I mean my mother, everything that she ever worked for, you know, all her life savings were gone.
[02:44:27.112 --> 02:44:28.093]  I mean they were worthless.
[02:44:28.633 --> 02:44:34.976]  You know, it came down to the point where, you know, her entire life savings could just go buy her a bag of groceries.
[02:44:34.976 --> 02:44:38.298]  And again, I oversimplify it, but I mean, how did it happen?
[02:44:38.298 --> 02:44:43.301]  Obviously, it was the dictator, but what were the other forces that did that?
[02:44:43.301 --> 02:44:53.726]  Well, I think the main issue, there was obviously the, I'm sorry, the farmers that were, you know, the farming situation that was happening there.
[02:44:53.726 --> 02:44:57.268]  Production and farming, there was a lot of conflict that happened with the
[02:44:57.990 --> 02:45:03.712]  Commercial farmers, the government just basically scapegoated the issues that were happening in the country.
[02:45:03.712 --> 02:45:07.333]  So just like the Russian Revolution, they took over the farms.
[02:45:07.333 --> 02:45:10.514]  Mao took over the farms and it caused a collapse.
[02:45:10.514 --> 02:45:11.634]  Right, yeah.
[02:45:11.634 --> 02:45:16.416]  So 60% of production went down when that happened with the farms.
[02:45:16.416 --> 02:45:18.816]  Unemployment just became rampant.
[02:45:18.816 --> 02:45:23.918]  So it was just like a cascading effect to the point where, you know, the entire system just collapsed.
[02:45:24.483 --> 02:45:30.791]  So, it was very sad to watch, but I came to the United States right when that stuff just started happening.
[02:45:30.791 --> 02:45:35.958]  So, the height of the collapse was when I had actually come here to the United States.
[02:45:35.958 --> 02:45:37.419]  So, I watched the beginning of it.
[02:45:37.419 --> 02:45:40.844]  So, I remember being, you know, standing in bread lines.
[02:45:40.844 --> 02:45:43.207]  I remember standing, you know, sleeping overnight.
[02:45:43.907 --> 02:45:48.249]  In a fuel queue, a fuel line, you know, waiting for gas the next morning.
[02:45:48.249 --> 02:45:50.530]  So it's, yeah, I've lived it.
[02:45:50.530 --> 02:45:58.774]  So I understand it, and that's why I felt that the Lord has called me to speak up against it, because I feel like Americans feel like that can never happen here.
[02:45:58.774 --> 02:46:05.317]  I could have never imagined that would happen in Zimbabwe, because Zimbabwe was a great country, very successful, very peaceful.
[02:46:05.317 --> 02:46:09.999]  I used to walk home from school, miles, nobody would bother me, very peaceful place.
[02:46:11.042 --> 02:46:12.542]  Um, and then that happened.
[02:46:12.542 --> 02:46:14.743]  So, it can happen here.
[02:46:14.743 --> 02:46:18.984]  Well, I totally agree, and I don't want to give it a dumbed-down answer, but I've read a little bit of history.
[02:46:18.984 --> 02:46:20.604]  I didn't live through it like you.
[02:46:20.604 --> 02:46:31.487]  Even though the, quote, white colonialists, the Dutch or whoever, or the British, weren't in control anymore, once that control was gone, the left said, get rid of the system, too!
[02:46:31.487 --> 02:46:33.728]  And then, basically, that's what happened.
[02:46:33.728 --> 02:46:34.108]  Is that a...
[02:46:35.911 --> 02:46:36.713]  That's true.
[02:46:36.713 --> 02:46:37.214]  That's true.
[02:46:37.214 --> 02:46:38.496]  And that's what's happening here.
[02:46:38.496 --> 02:46:42.524]  And that's why I was able to pick up on the whole Black Lives Matter movement.
[02:46:42.524 --> 02:46:47.994]  You know, it's about, you know, finding a victim class and then pitting that victim class against
[02:46:48.730 --> 02:46:53.795]  The producers and then the victim class will then overthrow the system.
[02:46:53.795 --> 02:46:56.698]  And that's just basically how Marxism works.
[02:46:56.698 --> 02:46:59.961]  And in every country, they exploit different divisions.
[02:46:59.961 --> 02:47:03.804]  So in Russia, they obviously couldn't use race because everybody is white.
[02:47:03.804 --> 02:47:05.986]  But in Zimbabwe, we do have that.
[02:47:05.986 --> 02:47:07.968]  We do have white and black Zimbabweans.
[02:47:07.968 --> 02:47:10.431]  So they exploited that racial
[02:47:11.534 --> 02:47:12.454]  That's right.
[02:47:12.454 --> 02:47:13.535]  You do a great job on the book.
[02:47:13.535 --> 02:47:13.755]  All right.
[02:47:13.755 --> 02:47:15.075]  Join us again for an hour just on Zimbabwe.
[02:47:15.075 --> 02:47:16.035]  Just amazing.
[02:47:16.035 --> 02:47:16.635]  Thank you, Melissa Tate.
[02:47:16.635 --> 02:47:17.236]  RealMelissaTate.com.
[02:47:17.236 --> 02:47:19.496]  The book is available, I guess, all over the place.
[02:47:19.496 --> 02:47:20.396]  I read an online version.
[02:47:39.281 --> 02:47:39.922]  It's on Amazon.
[02:47:39.922 --> 02:47:43.804]  A lot of people still shop on Amazon, but you can get it on my website.
[02:47:43.804 --> 02:47:44.625]  Oh, I don't care where they get it.
[02:47:44.625 --> 02:47:45.145]  They can get it on Amazon.
[02:47:45.145 --> 02:47:45.865]  It doesn't matter where they get it.
[02:47:45.865 --> 02:47:46.326]  Exactly.
[02:47:46.326 --> 02:47:47.907]  A choice privilege.
[02:47:47.907 --> 02:47:48.787]  All right.
[02:47:48.787 --> 02:47:49.968]  Melissa Tate, God bless you.
[02:47:49.968 --> 02:47:50.488]  You're amazing.
[02:47:50.488 --> 02:47:50.809]  Thank you.
[02:47:50.809 --> 02:47:52.990]  Thank you.
[02:47:52.990 --> 02:47:54.471]  Thank you.
[02:47:54.471 --> 02:47:54.851]  Wow.
[02:47:54.851 --> 02:47:55.852]  She is impressive.
[02:47:55.852 --> 02:47:56.212]  All right.
[02:47:56.212 --> 02:47:59.814]  I apologize to the callers making a hold for an hour, but I had her on.
[02:47:59.814 --> 02:48:00.875]  The phones were loaded.
[02:48:00.875 --> 02:48:02.376]  I wanted to get to your calls.
[02:48:02.376 --> 02:48:03.717]  So we're going to get to you right now.
[02:48:03.717 --> 02:48:05.038]  But let me tell you.
[02:48:05.038 --> 02:48:05.418]  Amazing.
[02:48:06.517 --> 02:48:08.678]  Amazing what the globalist, the UN, and the left did.
[02:48:08.678 --> 02:48:10.818]  Like, the white people aren't even in charge anymore.
[02:48:10.818 --> 02:48:14.719]  It's like, well, let's just blow up the free market because whites did it.
[02:48:14.719 --> 02:48:16.100]  Let's get rid of capitalism here.
[02:48:16.100 --> 02:48:28.223]  Doesn't matter what color you are, you are inheriting, whether you're white, black, old, young, whatever, this system that's not perfect, but my God, it's a lot better than other ones.
[02:48:28.223 --> 02:48:35.045]  And once the commies have blown everything up, there's nothing but starvation and death, which is what Klaus Schwab wants, while he's in Switzerland laughing at you.
[02:48:35.603 --> 02:48:39.044]  I'm not bashing the Swiss, I'm just saying that's where Klaus Schwab lives.
[02:48:39.044 --> 02:48:41.884]  They've got their safe zones while they do all this to us.
[02:48:41.884 --> 02:48:44.485]  And I live in America.
[02:48:44.485 --> 02:48:47.165]  I love America, like folks who lived in Zimbabwe.
[02:48:47.165 --> 02:48:53.647]  And you know, we didn't get into that, but they killed hundreds of thousands or drove out hundreds of thousands of white farmers.
[02:48:53.647 --> 02:48:57.728]  And you saw what happened once that happened.
[02:48:57.728 --> 02:48:58.848]  It's just the infrastructure was gone.
[02:48:59.631 --> 02:49:03.954]  All their contracts and all their know-how and all the things they did and all the things they knew was gone.
[02:49:03.954 --> 02:49:05.315]  The majority of blacks didn't want that.
[02:49:05.315 --> 02:49:09.357]  They tried to fight it, but the government wanted the control over the people.
[02:49:09.357 --> 02:49:11.018]  The government was jealous of independence.
[02:49:11.018 --> 02:49:14.561]  They were like, we can't have the general public here knowing how to run all this.
[02:49:14.561 --> 02:49:19.804]  We can't have the general public in charge of all this infrastructure get rid of it.
[02:49:19.804 --> 02:49:28.089]  Well, a couple guys in an army tank with machine guns don't know how to grow a bunch of vegetables.
[02:49:28.089 --> 02:49:28.990]  And so they starved to death.
[02:49:30.063 --> 02:49:34.285]  All right, we've got so many callers here that have been holding a long time.
[02:49:34.285 --> 02:49:35.246]  Who's been holding the longest?
[02:49:35.246 --> 02:49:41.909]  Who should I go to here first?
[02:49:41.909 --> 02:49:45.051]  No idea who I should go to first?
[02:49:45.051 --> 02:49:46.992]  Let's go to Bob in North Carolina.
[02:49:46.992 --> 02:49:47.793]  Bob, you're on the air.
[02:49:47.793 --> 02:49:48.613]  Thanks for rolling.
[02:49:48.613 --> 02:49:50.234]  Hey, Jay.
[02:49:50.234 --> 02:49:50.814]  What's up?
[02:49:50.814 --> 02:49:53.836]  Long-time listener since the 90s.
[02:49:53.836 --> 02:49:54.876]  Just give me a quick shout-out.
[02:49:56.987 --> 02:49:57.568]  I never call.
[02:49:57.568 --> 02:49:58.188]  I just listen.
[02:49:58.188 --> 02:49:59.589]  But I was compelled the other day.
[02:49:59.589 --> 02:50:00.229]  I was like, you know what?
[02:50:00.229 --> 02:50:02.890]  I'm going to send an email over to someone in the crew.
[02:50:02.890 --> 02:50:04.651]  And I did, but I didn't get a response.
[02:50:04.651 --> 02:50:05.892]  I was compelled to call.
[02:50:05.892 --> 02:50:08.153]  So let's just jump right into it.
[02:50:08.153 --> 02:50:10.134]  I live out here in the Carolinas.
[02:50:10.134 --> 02:50:16.778]  I work for, I would say, one of the top three financial institutions in the country, not the world.
[02:50:16.778 --> 02:50:20.720]  And, you know, majority of us are working from home from the pandemic.
[02:50:20.720 --> 02:50:23.762]  And now they're getting ready to bring people back into the office.
[02:50:24.355 --> 02:50:30.698]  And I know I'm not the only person probably listening that works from home that's getting ready to go back to the office.
[02:50:30.698 --> 02:50:35.281]  And that's probably getting ready to get segregated.
[02:50:35.281 --> 02:50:37.342]  So, and I'm sure you understand when I say that.
[02:50:37.342 --> 02:50:39.883]  Yeah, who's vaccinated, who isn't vaccinated.
[02:50:39.883 --> 02:50:40.504]  Exactly.
[02:50:40.504 --> 02:50:51.689]  So what they're getting ready to do is, if you're not vaccinated, they're going to require face covering, physical distancing, two... You're talking about JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs?
[02:50:51.689 --> 02:50:52.590]  Yeah, that's all the big banks.
[02:50:53.542 --> 02:50:54.863]  Yeah, I mean, there you go.
[02:50:54.863 --> 02:50:59.126]  I mean, I would rather... Think about the cult level of this.
[02:50:59.126 --> 02:51:01.108]  You didn't take a poison shot.
[02:51:01.108 --> 02:51:03.230]  They admit doesn't even protect you.
[02:51:03.230 --> 02:51:05.151]  We're in your medical business now.
[02:51:05.151 --> 02:51:06.692]  You didn't put stuff in your body.
[02:51:06.692 --> 02:51:10.475]  So you got to wear a thing over your face like you're a bad person.
[02:51:10.475 --> 02:51:11.476]  Talk about harassment.
[02:51:11.476 --> 02:51:12.277]  That is outrageous.
[02:51:12.967 --> 02:51:17.529]  No, AJ, not only that, they're making it an obstacle course where you'll just say, you know what?
[02:51:17.529 --> 02:51:18.590]  I'm just going to give in.
[02:51:18.590 --> 02:51:19.610]  I'll take the shot.
[02:51:19.610 --> 02:51:25.433]  And remember, these banks, these banks, I mean, they pride themselves in diversity and inclusion.
[02:51:25.433 --> 02:51:26.694]  Well, what about us?
[02:51:26.694 --> 02:51:31.996]  What about the large amount of people that work for these corporations that don't want to take the vaccine?
[02:51:31.996 --> 02:51:32.556]  Do we not?
[02:51:32.556 --> 02:51:37.199]  Are we not included in your diversity and inclusion, you know, document?
[02:51:37.199 --> 02:51:40.080]  They need to be sued, Morgan Stanley, all of them.
[02:51:40.080 --> 02:51:42.241]  How do they make you declare your medical record?
[02:51:42.859 --> 02:51:45.900]  How do they make you take an experimental shot?
[02:51:45.900 --> 02:51:47.660]  Well, I'm going to tell you this, AJ.
[02:51:47.660 --> 02:51:51.341]  What they have is what's called a vaccination status matrix.
[02:51:51.341 --> 02:51:54.902]  So you literally are basically giving up your HIPAA rights.
[02:51:54.902 --> 02:51:56.983]  They make you waive your rights.
[02:51:56.983 --> 02:52:00.944]  I'd sue them right there.
[02:52:00.944 --> 02:52:03.205]  How is it their business when you saw a dentist?
[02:52:03.205 --> 02:52:06.986]  How is it their business when you had a proctology exam?
[02:52:06.986 --> 02:52:08.886]  How is it their business?
[02:52:08.886 --> 02:52:09.827]  Agreed.
[02:52:09.827 --> 02:52:10.907]  Agreed.
[02:52:10.907 --> 02:52:11.367]  Agreed.
[02:52:13.977 --> 02:52:17.399]  Let me tell you something, this is just unbelievable.
[02:52:17.399 --> 02:52:30.005]  And it's crazy because, you know, senior management, we're not talking about upper-level management in these corporations, they're being pressured by, you know, the managers, the direct managers are being pressured by market managers, they're being pressured by senior managers.
[02:52:30.005 --> 02:52:30.865]  Bob, don't hang up!
[02:52:30.865 --> 02:52:33.447]  I'm back in two minutes and I'm right to you.
[02:52:33.447 --> 02:52:36.608]  Alright, fourth hour, your phone call, straight ahead.
[02:52:36.608 --> 02:52:38.209]  Don't hang up, I'm talking to you!
[02:52:40.746 --> 02:52:44.130]  X2 has been our number one bestseller over the years.
[02:52:44.130 --> 02:52:45.932]  Deep Earth Crystal Iodine.
[02:52:45.932 --> 02:52:46.913]  The good allergen.
[02:52:46.913 --> 02:52:49.795]  It is essential for all actions in the body.
[02:52:49.795 --> 02:52:51.237]  You must have it to live.
[02:52:51.237 --> 02:52:55.421]  The UN estimates 2 billion plus people have cognitive disabilities because they don't have enough iodine.
[02:52:55.421 --> 02:52:57.463]  We have X2 in two different bottles.
[02:52:57.463 --> 02:53:01.828]  Same amount in each bottle, but one has a spray top, one has a dropper top.
[02:53:01.828 --> 02:53:02.849]  60% off on the spray top.
[02:53:03.890 --> 02:53:08.392]  40% off on the dropper top for a limited time because they're both selling out.
[02:53:08.392 --> 02:53:10.794]  I want to thank all the supporters that have got me some of the years.
[02:53:10.794 --> 02:53:11.474]  They're amazing.
[02:53:11.474 --> 02:53:13.875]  So that's a great deal for you to stock up on it.
[02:53:13.875 --> 02:53:19.319]  But this deal is really for folks that have been on the fence and haven't experienced the good halogen for yourself.
[02:53:19.319 --> 02:53:21.660]  So, X2 in the dropper bottle and the spray bottle.
[02:53:22.260 --> 02:53:23.361]  The world is awakening.
[02:53:44.259 --> 02:53:47.760]  The world is beginning to understand the globalist paradigm.
[02:53:47.760 --> 02:53:59.063]  They are discovering the globalists, the elites, the manipulation, the CFR, the Trilateral Commission, the Bilderberg Group, the Bohemian Grove, the Club of Rome.
[02:53:59.063 --> 02:54:08.846]  And so, even though it seems like the globalists are winning, the truth is, they've had to come out in the open to attack human freedom because they're actually losing.
[02:54:08.846 --> 02:54:11.347]  We have forced them out in the open.
[02:54:11.983 --> 02:54:17.807]  So as bad as these times are, and a lot of negative things are about to happen, realize humanity is winning.
[02:54:17.807 --> 02:54:22.830]  You've got to trust in the plan of God, and trust in the plan of God's justice.
[02:54:22.830 --> 02:54:24.271]  That is invincible.
[02:54:24.271 --> 02:54:27.713]  That is ethereal, timeless, and unstoppable.
[02:54:27.713 --> 02:54:33.436]  So don't trust in man, trust in God, to lead God and direct your soul, and then take action against the globalists.
[02:54:33.436 --> 02:54:37.519]  And realize, you've got my commitment from Alex Jones and my crew to you.
[02:54:37.519 --> 02:54:41.301]  We will never back down from the globalists, and we will never surrender.
[02:54:44.648 --> 02:55:08.500]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:55:08.500 --> 02:55:13.503]  Ladies and gentlemen, on a Rikers scale of one to ten, it's a ten to say
[02:55:14.184 --> 02:55:16.726]  We're spying on all your text messages, the Democrats are.
[02:55:16.726 --> 02:55:21.130]  The NSA would know they'd all be arrested if they admitted to it.
[02:55:21.130 --> 02:55:24.292]  Oh, Tucker Carlson, the NSA's not spying on the Democrats.
[02:55:24.292 --> 02:55:27.455]  The Democrats just want access to everybody's text messages to spy on them.
[02:55:27.455 --> 02:55:29.936]  They're already doing it, I told you that.
[02:55:29.936 --> 02:55:32.018]  It's all come out already.
[02:55:32.018 --> 02:55:37.062]  And so yeah, Morgan Stanley, all the big ones, they're the bankers.
[02:55:37.062 --> 02:55:37.963]  They're the Bernie Madoffs.
[02:55:39.403 --> 02:55:47.271]  They're like, yeah, you're going to wear a mask and jump through all these hoops and do all... Oh, by the way, there's a booster shot you got to take because the thing we gave you doesn't protect you.
[02:55:47.271 --> 02:55:50.214]  Oh, but we don't have any liability for what it does to you.
[02:55:50.214 --> 02:55:54.099]  So the big corporations know that they're global governance.
[02:55:54.099 --> 02:55:55.420]  They set the precedent.
[02:55:55.420 --> 02:55:57.422]  Everybody else copies it.
[02:55:57.422 --> 02:55:59.364]  And so it's so sad to hear what Bob's talking about.
[02:55:59.364 --> 02:56:00.125]  Bob, finish your story.
[02:56:01.751 --> 02:56:10.375]  But the ironic thing of all this, and you know this, I mean, because you're amazingly smart and super duper intelligent, so you know most of these bankers, they're underwriters, right?
[02:56:10.375 --> 02:56:18.879]  So before they give out money, they do massive, massive research with, you know, whether it's going to be a business loan, you know, for a home loan, they do massive, massive research.
[02:56:19.259 --> 02:56:20.479]  Before they take risks.
[02:56:20.479 --> 02:56:23.320]  But in this case, are they doing the research?
[02:56:23.320 --> 02:56:25.320]  You know, do they really care?
[02:56:25.320 --> 02:56:25.540]  No.
[02:56:25.540 --> 02:56:26.841]  I mean, I don't know, AJ.
[02:56:26.841 --> 02:56:27.401]  You tell me.
[02:56:27.401 --> 02:56:29.181]  I think all they care about is liability.
[02:56:29.181 --> 02:56:32.182]  They want to show the government, hey... Well, it's not liability.
[02:56:32.182 --> 02:56:34.422]  They want eugenics.
[02:56:34.422 --> 02:56:40.723]  And I thought they'd set the precedent with a harmless vaccine and then set the precedent to make us take deadly ones.
[02:56:40.723 --> 02:56:41.244]  No.
[02:56:41.244 --> 02:56:43.244]  They're giving us stuff that's really bad right up front.
[02:56:44.125 --> 02:56:51.578]  And I just want to add, like, you made me laugh yesterday with the guy, ooey gooey, whatever, I forgot what he said.
[02:56:51.578 --> 02:56:53.321]  But that dude, he's insane.
[02:56:53.321 --> 02:56:54.784]  You know, AJ, you've been nailing it.
[02:56:54.784 --> 02:56:56.046]  You told us about the cable box.
[02:56:56.491 --> 02:57:02.117]  I mean, there's no difference what they're doing with the cable boxes is what they're doing with the with the cell phones.
[02:57:02.117 --> 02:57:03.739]  And let me just throw a fun note.
[02:57:03.739 --> 02:57:05.240]  Joe Booth needs to calm down.
[02:57:05.240 --> 02:57:12.949]  The last time he ran his mouth, he got ran up on by one of the Wu-Tang Clan members and got smacked up and they have video footage of it and then he shut up.
[02:57:12.949 --> 02:57:15.852]  So he needs to sit down trying to disrespect the king.
[02:57:16.232 --> 02:57:22.180]  Of Intel of the king of intelligence and the king of free information, which is you and we all know that he knows that as well.
[02:57:22.180 --> 02:57:32.735]  But I didn't need me to go on the side, but I just wanted to tell you this is because it's not right because, you know, when people go back to work that aren't vaccinated, we're going to go to designated work areas.
[02:57:32.735 --> 02:57:32.895]  Right?
[02:57:33.775 --> 02:57:39.019]  Not all these people are Trump supporters, and we all know that's one of the things that we didn't like about this.
[02:57:51.818 --> 02:57:54.279]  Try to say I was in the KKK, which I do not agree with.
[02:57:54.279 --> 02:57:56.339]  I'm not the Democratic Party.
[02:57:56.339 --> 02:58:00.541]  And I wanted to debate him because he's got a big show, but he pussed out and said he'll never debate me.
[02:58:00.541 --> 02:58:01.041]  Okay, fine.
[02:58:01.041 --> 02:58:01.861]  He started the fight.
[02:58:01.861 --> 02:58:02.541]  Whatever.
[02:58:02.541 --> 02:58:03.461]  He's a pussy.
[02:58:03.461 --> 02:58:04.842]  Excuse my French.
[02:58:04.842 --> 02:58:06.302]  Let's go to... Who's up next, guys?
[02:58:06.302 --> 02:58:11.444]  In order.
[02:58:11.444 --> 02:58:12.664]  First-timer in Louisiana.
[02:58:12.664 --> 02:58:14.045]  Thanks for holding so long.
[02:58:14.045 --> 02:58:14.825]  I really appreciate you.
[02:58:14.825 --> 02:58:15.085]  Go ahead.
[02:58:15.925 --> 02:58:16.806]  Hey, no problem.
[02:58:16.806 --> 02:58:25.331]  Real quick, I just want to say I order a lot of stuff in the store, and you need to make it to when I check out, I can donate money right when I check out.
[02:58:25.331 --> 02:58:27.393]  That would be so easy, so convenient.
[02:58:27.393 --> 02:58:29.594]  I agree, and it's something to do with the shopping cart.
[02:58:29.594 --> 02:58:30.795]  People have asked for that a lot.
[02:58:30.795 --> 02:58:33.557]  There should be a donations option.
[02:58:33.557 --> 02:58:35.218]  Yes, that's perfect.
[02:58:35.218 --> 02:58:36.198]  Now let's get right to it.
[02:58:37.526 --> 02:58:50.992]  You know, I heard you this morning, man, you came out fiery, and I think the reason why you feel like that is you're giving us all of this information, and make no mistake, we're taking this information, we're listening to it, we believe it, we see it.
[02:58:51.548 --> 02:58:55.212]  As you say, you're telling us the house is on fire all around us.
[02:58:55.212 --> 02:58:56.132]  Okay.
[02:58:56.132 --> 02:59:01.417]  Now, I smell the smoke, I feel the flames, I see the flames.
[02:59:01.417 --> 02:59:03.780]  Now, Alex, tell me how to get out of the house.
[02:59:03.780 --> 02:59:07.083]  That's the one thing that you... I mean, listen, here's the deal.
[02:59:07.083 --> 02:59:12.188]  I don't want to get put in prison, but at the same time, and I don't want any offensive violence, because that could go wrong.
[02:59:12.808 --> 02:59:14.769]  No, we've got to arrest Bill Gates and Fauci.
[02:59:14.769 --> 02:59:18.330]  I mean, we don't control... Tell you what, don't hang up.
[02:59:18.330 --> 02:59:20.610]  This is the most important question to ask in the last month.
[02:59:20.610 --> 02:59:21.291]  All the callers are great.
[02:59:21.291 --> 02:59:22.011]  Don't hang up.
[02:59:22.011 --> 02:59:22.431]  First timer.
[02:59:22.431 --> 02:59:25.772]  And I get to everybody else over this, then no one's going to take over the rest of the fourth hour out of M.O.'
[02:59:25.732 --> 02:59:27.692]  's in the war room today at 3 to 6 p.m.
[02:59:27.692 --> 02:59:31.033]  And I've got a bunch of meetings I've got to go to, but these calls are important.
[02:59:31.033 --> 02:59:33.074]  I'm not a general.
[02:59:33.074 --> 02:59:35.535]  I'm not trying to plan a war.
[02:59:35.535 --> 02:59:38.816]  We're under attack by Bill Gates and these eugenicists.
[02:59:38.816 --> 02:59:39.936]  So you ask, what do we do?
[02:59:40.996 --> 02:59:42.357]  They're the ones killing everybody.
[02:59:42.357 --> 02:59:47.880]  I call for a serious discussion about what we do about them.
[02:59:47.880 --> 02:59:56.165]  The globalists are having their revolution, but free humanity has to have its revolution.
[02:59:56.165 --> 03:00:09.893]  We have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers trying to enslave the entire biological processes of humans and turn us into these artificial, corporate, controlled,
[03:00:11.901 --> 03:00:13.442]  Slaves.
[03:00:13.442 --> 03:00:14.202]  Worse than slaves.
[03:00:14.202 --> 03:00:18.264]  They're just property from cradle to grave of the system.
[03:00:18.264 --> 03:00:25.787]  Rendered down to be servile minions of the system in a ritual of dominance and satanic control.
[03:00:25.787 --> 03:00:35.812]  We have to recognize their great reset post-industrial world, which realizes a nightmare dystopia, and we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia.
[03:00:35.812 --> 03:00:38.733]  It's that choice, it's that realization that's going to change the world.
[03:00:40.010 --> 03:00:42.172]  And it's the only choice we've got.
[03:00:42.172 --> 03:00:42.973]  Freedom or slavery.
[03:00:42.973 --> 03:00:44.434]  Good or evil.
[03:00:44.434 --> 03:00:45.795]  It is a spiritual battle.
[03:00:45.795 --> 03:00:51.860]  And InfoWars is at the tip of the spear fighting it.
[03:00:51.860 --> 03:00:54.522]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:00:54.522 --> 03:00:56.243]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:56.243 --> 03:00:59.746]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[03:01:04.185 --> 03:01:20.854]  All right, so we really should open the show tomorrow and take calls for four hours on what do we do about the UN and big media with an unapproved vaccine that's dangerous, killing people, trying to force us to take it, and saying we're terrorists and we don't take it.
[03:01:20.854 --> 03:01:27.317]  In fact, we're going to air next segment or the segment after that, then Owen will do a little prelude segment for his show.
[03:01:27.317 --> 03:01:32.980]  An OAN piece they did this morning with Reuters saying they're making it up that anybody's dying for the vaccine and they show all the documentation.
[03:01:33.706 --> 03:01:35.847]  I mean, who would sign on to kill all these people?
[03:01:35.847 --> 03:01:38.309]  Who would sign on to suppress treatments for COVID-19?
[03:01:38.309 --> 03:01:43.412]  That's a very real thing, but overblown, if you have the treatments.
[03:01:43.412 --> 03:01:47.214]  A bunch of evil people that are killing us through different means.
[03:01:47.214 --> 03:01:53.398]  You know, we all know a gun's an illegal way to kill somebody, a sword's an illegal way, a hammer, a baseball bat.
[03:01:53.398 --> 03:01:55.079]  You go to prison for that.
[03:01:55.079 --> 03:01:59.622]  But if you do it through a vaccine, well, then you're a hero.
[03:01:59.622 --> 03:02:01.683]  No, this is a new way to attack us, a new war.
[03:02:02.518 --> 03:02:05.659]  So I'll ask you the question first timer in Louisiana.
[03:02:05.659 --> 03:02:07.740]  What do we do about what they're doing?
[03:02:07.740 --> 03:02:09.140]  Because I'm asking that question.
[03:02:09.140 --> 03:02:09.781]  I'm asking you.
[03:02:09.781 --> 03:02:15.863]  Real quick, you said as you were going out, you're not a general.
[03:02:15.863 --> 03:02:17.283]  I'm sorry, you are.
[03:02:17.283 --> 03:02:18.444]  You are in that seat.
[03:02:18.444 --> 03:02:21.465]  You've delivered all of this information to us.
[03:02:21.465 --> 03:02:22.305]  And in a way,
[03:02:23.010 --> 03:02:25.533]  We feel helpless with all of this information.
[03:02:25.533 --> 03:02:26.674]  We see nothing happening.
[03:02:26.674 --> 03:02:35.445]  We only see the New World Order gaining ground on us and further submitting us in a stranglehold.
[03:02:35.445 --> 03:02:36.486]  You are a general.
[03:02:36.486 --> 03:02:37.767]  You are our coach.
[03:02:37.767 --> 03:02:39.109]  Okay, well here's the deal.
[03:02:41.580 --> 03:02:47.731]  If violence was carried out against Bill Gates of the Deep State right now, that would make them martyrs, and their whole agenda would continue on.
[03:02:47.731 --> 03:02:52.599]  We have to discredit the UN, the WTO, Big Pharma, and stop their programs.
[03:02:52.599 --> 03:02:53.401]  So how do we do that?
[03:02:54.457 --> 03:02:55.397]  No violence.
[03:02:55.397 --> 03:02:56.337]  No violence.
[03:02:56.337 --> 03:03:00.218]  But we need to stand our ground.
[03:03:00.218 --> 03:03:03.459]  Okay, I call for millions of people to surround Pfizer in New York.
[03:03:03.459 --> 03:03:06.220]  I call for millions of people to protest the White House peacefully.
[03:03:06.220 --> 03:03:07.480]  I mean, I'll go join you.
[03:03:07.480 --> 03:03:08.480]  I call for whatever.
[03:03:08.480 --> 03:03:15.522]  I mean, this is illegal, Nuremberg violation, beyond Tuskegee, evil, and we can't sit here and take it.
[03:03:15.522 --> 03:03:16.622]  I appreciate your call, First Timer.
[03:03:16.622 --> 03:03:20.003]  I mean, that's where I am.
[03:03:20.003 --> 03:03:20.883]  All I'm saying is,
[03:03:24.452 --> 03:03:31.838]  If Bill Gates was sitting right next to me in his stupid pink sweater right now, I would have trouble not trying to strangle him.
[03:03:31.838 --> 03:03:34.700]  But I'm not going to do that and turn him into a victim, you understand?
[03:03:34.700 --> 03:03:36.081]  I want to politically destroy him.
[03:03:36.081 --> 03:03:38.243]  I want to stop what he's doing.
[03:03:38.243 --> 03:03:46.869]  But... I mean, it takes enough time to figure all this out, much less what are we going to do about it.
[03:03:46.869 --> 03:03:51.272]  I just ask the average person, if it's a school teacher or a cop or fire department or a
[03:03:53.709 --> 03:03:54.310]  We're good to go.
[03:04:19.542 --> 03:04:20.602]  You know, I've tried my best.
[03:04:20.602 --> 03:04:22.543]  I mean, you know, we got a million people in D.C.
[03:04:22.543 --> 03:04:27.584]  to protest the election fraud, and they just hijacked it and had provocateurs break into the Capitol and blame us.
[03:04:27.584 --> 03:04:28.184]  So that's what I mean.
[03:04:28.184 --> 03:04:34.306]  Like, you can get... We've got power to put troops on the field.
[03:04:34.306 --> 03:04:36.606]  But then what happens once we start that fight?
[03:04:36.606 --> 03:04:37.726]  That's the thing about the globalists.
[03:04:37.726 --> 03:04:39.267]  They've started a big fight.
[03:04:39.267 --> 03:04:41.387]  Where they think they were going is not happening.
[03:04:41.387 --> 03:04:42.748]  They're getting hurt right now.
[03:04:42.748 --> 03:04:43.628]  They're getting exposed.
[03:04:43.628 --> 03:04:44.408]  They're getting discredited.
[03:04:46.405 --> 03:04:50.408]  That doesn't make me smile and click my heels and just feel like we've done some great job.
[03:04:50.408 --> 03:04:52.750]  I don't want to fight with Bill Gates.
[03:04:52.750 --> 03:04:56.053]  I don't want to fight with the Pentagon.
[03:04:56.053 --> 03:04:57.174]  But they started a fight with us.
[03:04:57.174 --> 03:05:00.997]  And you're like, well, let's fight with them.
[03:05:00.997 --> 03:05:03.019]  Well, the average military person isn't part of that.
[03:05:03.019 --> 03:05:04.320]  They're compartmentalized.
[03:05:04.320 --> 03:05:05.781]  They're some of the best people we've got.
[03:05:05.781 --> 03:05:09.444]  I mean, as bad as the FBI is, the average FBI agent's not a bad person.
[03:05:09.444 --> 03:05:10.265]  They're not our enemy.
[03:05:10.265 --> 03:05:12.567]  So, I mean, it's just like, it's spiritual, folks.
[03:05:13.180 --> 03:05:18.081]  We have spiritual evil in charge on top, and only God's going to fix this.
[03:05:18.081 --> 03:05:22.923]  We just have to trust God, do the right thing, speak up, and then God will fix it.
[03:05:22.923 --> 03:05:25.443]  And I'm not punting on that.
[03:05:25.443 --> 03:05:27.084]  It's like I've learned, man.
[03:05:27.084 --> 03:05:29.825]  I know all this stuff, forwards and backwards.
[03:05:29.825 --> 03:05:35.666]  I don't know what orders to give, and anybody pretending they do is a liar.
[03:05:35.666 --> 03:05:40.827]  These globalists, Klaus Schwab and all them, telling the big old bankers, oh, we got a plan to take over.
[03:05:40.827 --> 03:05:42.508]  They just set them up for destruction.
[03:05:44.033 --> 03:05:46.075]  I mean, I can tell you this isn't going to work in the end.
[03:05:46.075 --> 03:05:48.096]  I can tell you they're screwed.
[03:05:48.096 --> 03:05:49.778]  The question is, how long does it go?
[03:05:49.778 --> 03:05:50.999]  How many people die?
[03:05:50.999 --> 03:05:53.260]  How bad is it going to get?
[03:05:53.260 --> 03:05:59.465]  It's easy to look at what they did and tell you they screwed the pooch.
[03:05:59.465 --> 03:06:02.027]  But does that mean I'm ready to pull the trigger on something?
[03:06:02.027 --> 03:06:04.209]  No, sir.
[03:06:04.209 --> 03:06:11.475]  Because I've seen, I can have the most good intentions, and man, that gets taken away from me just like that.
[03:06:11.475 --> 03:06:12.396]  I know the folks started Q.
[03:06:17.910 --> 03:06:24.452]  Inspired by us, and what we did exposing pedophile rings and all the rest of it.
[03:06:24.452 --> 03:06:28.514]  And they saw me sued over it, and they saw us attacked over it, and they said, well, we'll just do it anonymously.
[03:06:28.514 --> 03:06:32.635]  And that got taken away from them in a month.
[03:06:32.635 --> 03:06:35.676]  I got tipped off by some of our own people, like, you didn't know you're right under the nose of that?
[03:06:35.676 --> 03:06:38.818]  It turned out that was true.
[03:06:38.818 --> 03:06:45.320]  So, man, I've learned, I'm just a man, and it takes enough of my energy to figure out how the cow ate the cabbage.
[03:06:46.127 --> 03:06:57.591]  I sure as hell don't know how to run some war against the New World Order, because it's a person-by-person issue.
[03:06:57.591 --> 03:06:59.292]  It's good versus evil.
[03:06:59.292 --> 03:07:04.514]  And we are an immoral, demonic people on average, and so we're cursed.
[03:07:04.514 --> 03:07:09.036]  And if we all changed our hearts and got right with God, it would fix itself.
[03:07:09.036 --> 03:07:09.476]  And that's that.
[03:07:10.399 --> 03:07:12.841]  Now does that mean we let them inject us with deadly poison?
[03:07:12.841 --> 03:07:14.703]  Does that mean we let them burn our cities down?
[03:07:14.703 --> 03:07:16.644]  Does that mean we go along with... No!
[03:07:16.644 --> 03:07:18.606]  No!
[03:07:18.606 --> 03:07:23.550]  I'm just saying you got to give those orders yourself in your own personal life.
[03:07:23.550 --> 03:07:32.857]  I'm not some cult leader up here telling you like the... I mean, I've got right here this video we didn't even play of Biden.
[03:07:32.857 --> 03:07:38.382]  Claims capital insurrectionists worse than Civil War Confederates.
[03:07:38.382 --> 03:07:39.783]  Civil War killed a million people.
[03:07:42.759 --> 03:07:44.340]  He says that was worse.
[03:07:44.340 --> 03:07:46.402]  Four dead people.
[03:07:46.402 --> 03:07:51.706]  It's an assault on reality.
[03:07:51.706 --> 03:07:55.288]  William in California, go ahead, you're on the air.
[03:07:55.288 --> 03:07:56.669]  Hi Alex, can you hear me?
[03:07:56.669 --> 03:07:57.210]  I can, brother.
[03:07:57.210 --> 03:08:00.973]  Hi Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[03:08:00.973 --> 03:08:05.296]  I've been listening here, I've been listening to your guest, Melissa.
[03:08:05.296 --> 03:08:11.400]  And first of all, I just want to tell everybody, I want to tell all of your listeners, be at peace.
[03:08:11.400 --> 03:08:12.121]  Let's be calm.
[03:08:12.928 --> 03:08:15.190]  And let's be focused.
[03:08:15.190 --> 03:08:21.374]  We're going up against something, and we know we're going up against something now, as your last caller said.
[03:08:21.374 --> 03:08:24.637]  We're feeling the flames, and we want to know where to go.
[03:08:24.637 --> 03:08:25.698]  We need to be focused.
[03:08:25.698 --> 03:08:38.607]  I've had this dream, and it probably comes from my grandmother, but I'm in a Higgins boat, and I can feel the sea on my face.
[03:08:38.607 --> 03:08:41.930]  And I know what I'm about to do and encounter
[03:08:42.481 --> 03:08:46.182]  is going to be a great challenge.
[03:08:46.182 --> 03:08:54.946]  And I just want to say to everybody, fear not because God has delivered our enemy into our hands.
[03:08:54.946 --> 03:08:58.467]  We may not know these things, but they are delivered.
[03:08:58.467 --> 03:09:02.649]  What they've done is they've bit the tiger in the butt by attacking our children.
[03:09:02.649 --> 03:09:10.692]  And as your last, as your guest said, and she triggered something when she said something about getting between a bear and its cub.
[03:09:12.267 --> 03:09:18.051]  There's something instinctual that will occur, and I know I've seen it happen.
[03:09:18.051 --> 03:09:41.048]  I've worked with the Park Service, and I can only say our enemy has been delivered, and it's a matter of time, but we're about to hit the beach, and we're going to have to feel the flames, and we're going to encounter some things that we were maybe not encountering in our minds.
[03:09:41.724 --> 03:09:45.786]  Prepare a prepared wife.
[03:09:45.786 --> 03:09:46.506]  God bless you all.
[03:09:46.506 --> 03:09:48.747]  God bless you, Alex, for what you do.
[03:09:48.747 --> 03:09:49.807]  Well, God bless you, brother.
[03:09:49.807 --> 03:09:52.088]  So what do you think the timetable is?
[03:09:52.088 --> 03:09:58.951]  I mean, Biden's preparing martial law and nationwide lockdowns, and I'm not going to put up with it.
[03:09:58.951 --> 03:09:59.792]  All right.
[03:09:59.792 --> 03:10:03.693]  Owen Schroeder is coming up, but I swore to go to your call, so I'm going to jam in.
[03:10:03.693 --> 03:10:07.875]  Barbara, Luke, Gayle, and Jerry in this next segment.
[03:10:08.536 --> 03:10:12.540]  Then we're going to air an OAN report, and then Owen will come at the end of it.
[03:10:12.540 --> 03:10:15.363]  It was so powerful ahead of the War Room today.
[03:10:15.363 --> 03:10:16.484]  And so definitely look for that.
[03:10:16.484 --> 03:10:18.566]  I've got to tell the crew I had a big meeting.
[03:10:18.566 --> 03:10:21.930]  Everybody's waiting for me to be at this meeting.
[03:10:21.930 --> 03:10:24.833]  But let me let them know.
[03:10:24.833 --> 03:10:25.874]  Almost off.
[03:10:25.874 --> 03:10:26.995]  Almost off.
[03:10:28.211 --> 03:10:30.553]  Because I literally spent half my time trying to fund this operation.
[03:10:30.553 --> 03:10:31.653]  That's what I'm dealing with there.
[03:10:31.653 --> 03:10:33.654]  So I should probably plug.
[03:10:33.654 --> 03:10:35.155]  We have the new sales going right now.
[03:10:35.155 --> 03:10:40.179]  The X2 in the spray bottle and in the dripper bottle is 60 and 40% off.
[03:10:40.179 --> 03:10:43.401]  That's going to sell off, and I'm still selling it out at that price.
[03:10:43.401 --> 03:10:46.603]  And we have the new green fiber that's in that's so good, 50% off.
[03:10:51.150 --> 03:10:52.411]  Jacob in Ohio.
[03:10:52.411 --> 03:10:52.811]  Welcome.
[03:10:52.811 --> 03:10:53.251]  Go ahead.
[03:10:53.251 --> 03:10:55.113]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[03:10:55.113 --> 03:10:56.213]  Great last caller.
[03:10:56.213 --> 03:10:59.275]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[03:10:59.275 --> 03:11:04.979]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, demoralization, and absurdity.
[03:11:04.979 --> 03:11:06.560]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone.
[03:11:07.000 --> 03:11:07.500]  All right.
[03:11:07.500 --> 03:11:08.761]  Eric in New Hampshire.
[03:11:08.761 --> 03:11:09.702]  Eric, thanks for calling.
[03:11:09.702 --> 03:11:10.063]  Go ahead.
[03:11:10.063 --> 03:11:10.483]  Hey, Alex.
[03:11:10.483 --> 03:11:11.624]  Thanks for taking my call.
[03:11:11.624 --> 03:11:14.646]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for one of the products.
[03:11:14.646 --> 03:11:16.307]  The X Team does wonders.
[03:11:16.307 --> 03:11:17.448]  I recommend it to everybody.
[03:11:17.448 --> 03:11:18.629]  You're on the fence about it.
[03:11:18.629 --> 03:11:19.430]  Get off the fence.
[03:11:19.430 --> 03:11:20.311]  Get the product.
[03:11:20.311 --> 03:11:21.532]  Support the Infowar.
[03:11:21.532 --> 03:11:22.813]  Tyler in Maine.
[03:11:22.813 --> 03:11:23.473]  You're on the air.
[03:11:23.473 --> 03:11:24.014]  Thanks for calling.
[03:11:24.014 --> 03:11:24.394]  Go ahead.
[03:11:24.394 --> 03:11:25.034]  Hey, Alex.
[03:11:25.034 --> 03:11:26.095]  It's great to be on with you.
[03:11:26.095 --> 03:11:26.856]  It's an honor.
[03:11:26.856 --> 03:11:27.116]  Honor.
[03:11:27.116 --> 03:11:27.677]  Talk to you.
[03:11:27.677 --> 03:11:28.037]  Awesome.
[03:11:28.577 --> 03:11:32.100]  Uh, so first thing I wanted to do is say I love the product.
[03:11:32.100 --> 03:11:34.222]  It's Alpha Power, even at 29.
[03:11:34.222 --> 03:11:36.765]  If you ask my better half, she loves it.
[03:11:36.765 --> 03:11:38.326]  Uh, and it helps in the bedroom.
[03:11:38.326 --> 03:11:40.988]  So, just number one for a few... Well, it definitely works.
[03:11:40.988 --> 03:11:41.649]  It's not a joke.
[03:11:41.649 --> 03:11:42.650]  Yeah.
[03:11:42.650 --> 03:11:43.310]  Absolutely.
[03:11:48.027 --> 03:11:50.508]  I never had a marketing plan for InfoWars.
[03:11:50.508 --> 03:11:54.789]  I went out and found the best products I could find from the research to funder operation.
[03:11:54.789 --> 03:11:59.450]  I wanted you to get products that empowered you, that you loved, so you'd want to come back and buy more.
[03:11:59.450 --> 03:12:01.010]  I treat you like I want to be treated.
[03:12:01.010 --> 03:12:02.011]  It's very, very simple.
[03:12:02.011 --> 03:12:03.031]  It's instinctive.
[03:12:03.031 --> 03:12:03.611]  It's spiritual.
[03:12:03.611 --> 03:12:04.351]  It's what I do.
[03:12:04.351 --> 03:12:07.792]  And that said, our iodine products have become our best sellers.
[03:12:07.792 --> 03:12:14.694]  And X2 right now is discounted because listeners and viewers are habituated to only buy it when it's on sale.
[03:12:15.274 --> 03:12:15.975]  And so I'm going to catch 22.
[03:12:15.975 --> 03:12:18.717]  When I don't have it on sale, I don't sell it.
[03:12:18.717 --> 03:12:23.620]  But we're selling out of all our other products because of supply chain breakdowns, and so I'm going to catch 22.
[03:12:23.620 --> 03:12:25.642]  I need to sell products at full price, but I can't.
[03:12:25.642 --> 03:12:27.463]  I've got to sell them at discount.
[03:12:27.463 --> 03:12:28.724]  And so, it's discounted.
[03:12:28.724 --> 03:12:34.108]  40% off for the dropper bottle, 60% off for the spray bottle, even though it's about to sell out.
[03:12:34.108 --> 03:12:35.249]  It won't be available for months.
[03:12:35.709 --> 03:12:36.710]  So get it.
[03:12:36.710 --> 03:12:43.313]  X2 is selling out at InfowarsTore.com for 40 and 60% off with double patreon points and free shipping.
[03:12:43.313 --> 03:12:44.254]  Because why?
[03:12:44.254 --> 03:12:45.295]  That's when you buy it.
[03:12:45.295 --> 03:12:46.795]  We need your funds or we'll be off air.
[03:12:46.795 --> 03:12:50.377]  It's an amazing product.
[03:12:50.377 --> 03:12:53.019]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:13:17.595 --> 03:13:22.257]  All right, let's jam in three phone calls right now from Luke, Gail, and Jerry.
[03:13:22.257 --> 03:13:26.579]  And then we got a special report from OAN, who are great guys, but I saw it this morning.
[03:13:26.579 --> 03:13:27.980]  I said, we got to air this.
[03:13:27.980 --> 03:13:31.442]  And then Owen Schroeder takes over ahead of the war room.
[03:13:31.442 --> 03:13:33.182]  Gail in Vegas.
[03:13:33.182 --> 03:13:33.963]  Welcome, Gail.
[03:13:33.963 --> 03:13:34.603]  Thanks for holding.
[03:13:34.603 --> 03:13:36.364]  Go ahead.
[03:13:36.364 --> 03:13:36.824]  Yes.
[03:13:36.824 --> 03:13:37.364]  Hi, Alex.
[03:13:37.364 --> 03:13:38.945]  I just wanted to tell you thank you.
[03:13:38.945 --> 03:13:41.666]  I'm a first time caller and don't give up.
[03:13:41.666 --> 03:13:42.667]  We really need you.
[03:13:43.420 --> 03:13:46.101]  I wasn't trying to throw fits earlier and say I'm going to give up.
[03:13:46.101 --> 03:13:47.241]  It's the opposite.
[03:13:47.241 --> 03:13:48.161]  I'm not going to give up.
[03:13:48.161 --> 03:13:52.082]  I may get a battle axe, actually.
[03:13:52.082 --> 03:13:54.443]  It almost feels evil to keep talking about this.
[03:13:54.443 --> 03:13:56.083]  You see what I'm saying?
[03:13:56.083 --> 03:13:57.324]  Yeah, I'll join you.
[03:13:57.324 --> 03:14:02.485]  But anyhow, it was nice to hear from Melissa, and it brought back some memories when I was preaching.
[03:14:02.485 --> 03:14:05.306]  My parents took us on a tour down to South America.
[03:14:06.289 --> 03:14:12.175]  And we were caught in the revolution that they had going on there, and we were locked into our hotel rooms.
[03:14:12.175 --> 03:14:14.617]  We couldn't leave the hotel.
[03:14:14.617 --> 03:14:21.744]  They had soldiers walking up and down on the sidewalks that we could see from the window with their rifles, and it took a long time for the U.S.
[03:14:21.744 --> 03:14:27.249]  consulate to finally get the okay for us to leave the country, and I wish other people in this country had a chance to go
[03:14:27.805 --> 03:14:31.926]  And see some of those things in other countries and they would appreciate what we really have here.
[03:14:31.926 --> 03:14:37.327]  They would recognize we were put under artificial UN martial law to get us ready.
[03:14:37.327 --> 03:14:44.509]  Yes, and another thing I wanted to mention was why can't the Patriots form their own police department?
[03:14:44.509 --> 03:14:47.110]  I have a thing here I would like to read real quick.
[03:14:47.110 --> 03:14:55.472]  The police are a constituted body of persons empowered by a state with the aim to enforce the law to ensure the safety, health, and possessions of citizens
[03:14:55.979 --> 03:14:58.362]  And to prevent crime and civil disorder.
[03:14:58.362 --> 03:15:05.289]  Their lawful powers include arrest and the use of force legitimized by the state via the monopoly on violence.
[03:15:05.289 --> 03:15:17.442]  The term is mostly commonly associated with the police forces of a sovereign state that are authorized to exercise the police power of that state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility.
[03:15:17.918 --> 03:15:26.345]  Police forces are often defined as being separate from the military and other organizations involved in the defense of the state against foreign aggression.
[03:15:26.345 --> 03:15:27.266]  Sure, let me boil this down.
[03:15:27.266 --> 03:15:32.771]  You're talking about federalism, and you have the federal government, the state government, local government, state law.
[03:15:32.771 --> 03:15:37.115]  You can create a city with people, incorporate and hire our own police force, absolutely.
[03:15:37.515 --> 03:15:43.121]  So the Democrats, it's a political move to get rid of the police or actually get rid of them and remake them.
[03:15:43.121 --> 03:15:48.828]  So you're right, we can reconstitute the police as part of our will anytime we wish under the militia power.
[03:15:49.747 --> 03:15:56.711]  Why can't the patriots get together and we can all form our police force and go after and arrest all these criminals in Washington?
[03:15:56.711 --> 03:16:03.135]  That's what the Democrats are taking over all the cities and making them Soros run to try to arrest Alex Jones and Donald Trump.
[03:16:03.135 --> 03:16:04.456]  But so what you're saying is right.
[03:16:04.456 --> 03:16:07.818]  We should be running our cities and arresting them, not the other way around.
[03:16:07.818 --> 03:16:09.299]  Beautiful solution, Gail.
[03:16:09.299 --> 03:16:10.820]  Thank you so much.
[03:16:10.820 --> 03:16:13.802]  All right, Luke in Washington.
[03:16:13.802 --> 03:16:14.182]  Go ahead.
[03:16:14.182 --> 03:16:15.863]  You're on the air.
[03:16:15.863 --> 03:16:17.144]  Thank you for taking my call, Alex.
[03:16:17.144 --> 03:16:17.404]  Yes, sir.
[03:16:18.442 --> 03:16:23.566]  I just wanted to say, the ruler of this world has already been judged by Jesus Christ and his victory on the cross.
[03:16:23.566 --> 03:16:29.710]  Eventually, the separation of the wheat from the tares will happen, but we all grow together until the harvest.
[03:16:29.710 --> 03:16:35.054]  And that means even members of our own family may resonate with the world and not Jesus Christ.
[03:16:35.054 --> 03:16:39.778]  And the power of belief, as you believe so it shall be, the power of the mind.
[03:16:40.959 --> 03:16:50.403]  I want to highlight the idea of unselfish wishes and the power, like selfish wishes backfire, like all of Aladdin's wishes in the movie Aladdin.
[03:16:50.403 --> 03:16:51.544]  No, I agree.
[03:16:51.544 --> 03:16:54.725]  None of my selfish wishes ever came true.
[03:16:54.725 --> 03:16:58.447]  All of my unselfish wishes came true.
[03:16:58.447 --> 03:17:02.289]  Precisely, Aladdin frees the genie at the end with his last wish.
[03:17:03.174 --> 03:17:12.939]  When Homer in The Simpsons uses all of his selfish wishes, they backfire, but then Flanders, the Christian, uses the monkey paw and it gets rid of the aliens.
[03:17:12.939 --> 03:17:16.721]  And then also in The Simpsons, Flanders has a bomb shelter.
[03:17:16.721 --> 03:17:19.682]  They all kick him out of it, and then they realize it's wrong.
[03:17:19.682 --> 03:17:27.406]  They go out and join him to face the doom, and the meteor ends up hitting the shelter that they would have been in.
[03:17:27.406 --> 03:17:27.786]  And so,
[03:17:29.076 --> 03:17:32.658]  That's the concept of what we could be facing right here.
[03:17:32.658 --> 03:17:34.639]  What we run away from, we find.
[03:17:34.639 --> 03:17:38.081]  By running away from tyranny, we let it take over.
[03:17:38.081 --> 03:17:38.741]  Got it.
[03:17:38.741 --> 03:17:45.265]  In Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, Luke says, I don't believe it, and Yoda says, that is why you fail.
[03:17:45.265 --> 03:17:50.027]  And when Neo starts to face the Agents in the Matrix, they ask, what is he doing?
[03:17:50.027 --> 03:17:53.089]  He's beginning to believe, is what Morpheus says.
[03:17:53.089 --> 03:17:57.451]  In Braveheart, I want to believe as he does, says Robert DeBruce.
[03:17:58.408 --> 03:18:06.131]  And so we got to keep shining the light on the darkness and be a light, but not become the darkness.
[03:18:06.131 --> 03:18:09.612]  And so what you're doing is what we need to be doing.
[03:18:09.612 --> 03:18:11.353]  And then I could keep going.
[03:18:11.353 --> 03:18:12.313]  I don't know.
[03:18:12.313 --> 03:18:18.675]  In the meantime, the enemy's modus operandi appears to be mirroring, copying, and inverting.
[03:18:18.675 --> 03:18:24.637]  And my conjecture is they have inverted the Holy Trinity into what psychology describes as the dark triad.
[03:18:24.637 --> 03:18:26.958]  Psychopathy, narcissism, Machiavellianism.
[03:18:27.652 --> 03:18:33.034]  And, uh, aka their secret religion, witchcraft, Satanism, Luciferianism.
[03:18:33.034 --> 03:18:40.437]  And, uh, so body snatching can be spiritual, psychological, technological, or maybe even biological.
[03:18:40.437 --> 03:18:43.518]  It amounts to the same thing, appearing human, but are not.
[03:18:43.518 --> 03:18:44.779]  Human husk.
[03:18:44.779 --> 03:18:50.221]  They are pretenders, actors, with traits of the dark triad, which include mimicking our behavior.
[03:18:51.073 --> 03:19:03.856]  And uh, they could, it might not be an extraterrestrial alien, but it might be a terrestrial alien, what Illuminati whistleblower Donald Marshall describes as the human drone, parasited by a- Alright, hey guys, get Luke's name and number.
[03:19:03.856 --> 03:19:06.056]  Luke, come on for two seconds, we'll be tomorrow.
[03:19:06.056 --> 03:19:08.757]  You held for over an hour to come on, amazing points.
[03:19:08.757 --> 03:19:11.057]  I want Luke on when we first go to college tomorrow, guys.
[03:19:11.057 --> 03:19:13.638]  Don't forget, Luke is a guest tomorrow, if he can do it.
[03:19:13.638 --> 03:19:14.538]  Thank you, Luke.
[03:19:14.538 --> 03:19:20.639]  I promise to get to everybody, Jerry in California, last caller ahead of this special report, Anno and Troyer, go ahead.
[03:19:22.245 --> 03:19:23.105]  Yeah, Alex.
[03:19:23.105 --> 03:19:23.646]  Sorcery.
[03:19:23.646 --> 03:19:25.166]  Welcome, sir.
[03:19:25.166 --> 03:19:25.506]  Go ahead.
[03:19:25.506 --> 03:19:26.387]  Sorcery.
[03:19:26.387 --> 03:19:27.207]  Big sorcery.
[03:19:27.207 --> 03:19:29.548]  Sorcery, pseudicals.
[03:19:29.548 --> 03:19:35.410]  That's what... You know, maybe I'm half-deaf, which has half-happened.
[03:19:35.410 --> 03:19:36.491]  My eardrum is perforated.
[03:19:36.491 --> 03:19:37.611]  I have trouble hearing.
[03:19:37.611 --> 03:19:39.372]  Say it again.
[03:19:39.372 --> 03:19:39.932]  Sorcery.
[03:19:39.932 --> 03:19:41.993]  You know, big sorcery.
[03:19:41.993 --> 03:19:44.174]  Sorcery, pseudicals.
[03:19:44.174 --> 03:19:45.435]  It's big pharma.
[03:19:45.435 --> 03:19:47.095]  Pharma is sorcery.
[03:19:47.095 --> 03:19:48.336]  Oh, big pharma, sorcery.
[03:19:48.336 --> 03:19:48.756]  I heard that.
[03:19:49.631 --> 03:19:50.011]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:19:50.011 --> 03:19:50.531]  I'm sorry.
[03:19:50.531 --> 03:19:51.592]  I'm not coming in well.
[03:19:51.592 --> 03:19:52.352]  No, you're coming in now.
[03:19:52.352 --> 03:19:53.352]  Go ahead.
[03:19:53.352 --> 03:19:54.472]  Okay, yeah.
[03:19:54.472 --> 03:19:55.433]  I just wanted to say that.
[03:19:55.433 --> 03:20:02.594]  I also wanted to say that we should make a new party called the American Supremacist Party.
[03:20:02.594 --> 03:20:04.815]  I mean, I'm an American supremacist.
[03:20:04.815 --> 03:20:09.536]  I'm not any kind of... All creeds, colors, and nationalities are welcome.
[03:20:09.536 --> 03:20:14.318]  We love God, country, and each other.
[03:20:14.318 --> 03:20:15.518]  You're talking about America first.
[03:20:15.518 --> 03:20:15.878]  Do this.
[03:20:16.621 --> 03:20:24.968]  We're going to have Jerry back on tomorrow, too, but on a good line, or maybe we're going to have Jerry on via audio Skype or something.
[03:20:24.968 --> 03:20:28.831]  Because, I mean, I guess half of you understand that I got part of it, but I want to hear what Jerry has to say.
[03:20:28.831 --> 03:20:30.353]  Okay.
[03:20:30.353 --> 03:20:41.242]  This morning before I went live, I saw OAN at like 10 o'clock this morning do a great report responding to Reuters and others lying about them and what they'd actually said about COVID and COVID deaths.
[03:20:41.242 --> 03:20:42.603]  So, very important report.
[03:20:42.603 --> 03:20:43.944]  We're about to air it separately.
[03:20:45.243 --> 03:20:46.284]  I need your support.
[03:20:46.284 --> 03:20:47.425]  I appreciate your support.
[03:20:47.425 --> 03:20:48.546]  I'm very thankful for it.
[03:20:48.546 --> 03:20:50.748]  I ain't asking for it.
[03:20:50.748 --> 03:20:51.889]  We got products you need.
[03:20:51.889 --> 03:20:55.092]  We have X2.
[03:20:55.092 --> 03:20:56.173]  In the spray bottle.
[03:20:56.173 --> 03:20:57.274]  Exact same X2.
[03:20:57.274 --> 03:20:58.575]  Exact same amount.
[03:20:58.575 --> 03:20:59.696]  But it's 60% off.
[03:20:59.696 --> 03:21:00.457]  Biggest deal ever.
[03:21:00.457 --> 03:21:02.058]  And we have it in a dripper bottle.
[03:21:02.058 --> 03:21:03.840]  40% off.
[03:21:03.840 --> 03:21:04.921]  The good halogen.
[03:21:04.921 --> 03:21:06.702]  Takes about two weeks to kick in.
[03:21:06.702 --> 03:21:08.985]  Experience what Big Brother doesn't want you to have.
[03:21:08.985 --> 03:21:09.985]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:21:09.985 --> 03:21:10.446]  Then we've got

[03:21:25.293 --> 03:21:27.014]  We want to thank you all for your support.
[03:21:27.014 --> 03:21:29.115]  Alright, we got this OAN report coming up.
[03:21:29.716 --> 03:21:34.538]  Then Owen Schroyer's coming in, and then he's hosting the rest of the transmission.
[03:21:34.538 --> 03:21:35.178]  Great job, crew.
[03:21:35.178 --> 03:21:36.059]  We love you.
[03:21:36.059 --> 03:21:37.199]  We appreciate Melissa Tate.
[03:21:37.199 --> 03:21:39.800]  She was an amazing guest.
[03:21:39.800 --> 03:21:43.482]  That lady just radiates like an angel, doesn't she?
[03:21:43.482 --> 03:21:44.542]  All right, we'll be right back.
[03:21:44.542 --> 03:21:47.503]  I love angels.
[03:21:47.503 --> 03:21:51.825]  You know, listeners call into the show and they thank me, and it makes me feel pathetic.
[03:21:52.606 --> 03:21:56.549]  Because I sit there and I beg you for support constantly.
[03:21:56.549 --> 03:21:59.892]  For prayer, for financial support, and for word of mouth.
[03:21:59.892 --> 03:22:01.333]  And we're all in this together.
[03:22:01.333 --> 03:22:06.697]  And it gets old having to come to you and say, hey, I got great products, please buy them or we won't be here on air.
[03:22:06.697 --> 03:22:07.397]  But it's true.
[03:22:07.397 --> 03:22:10.800]  We're the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this level.
[03:22:11.540 --> 03:22:14.021]  That is not beholden to the big corporate sponsors.
[03:22:14.021 --> 03:22:16.081]  And they've harassed and almost shut down everybody else.
[03:22:16.081 --> 03:22:17.862]  They've crippled all the other groups.
[03:22:17.862 --> 03:22:18.722]  And we're still here.
[03:22:18.722 --> 03:22:23.143]  And as this whole New World Order comes out in the open, our credibility is going up.
[03:22:23.143 --> 03:22:24.764]  That's why we've got to be taken off air.
[03:22:24.764 --> 03:22:26.904]  That's why America has got to be taken down.
[03:22:26.904 --> 03:22:28.665]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved.
[03:22:29.205 --> 03:22:31.307]  And America's still quasi-free.
[03:22:31.307 --> 03:22:32.387]  You can't have InfoWars.
[03:22:32.387 --> 03:22:36.410]  It's been proven right being on air with all the craziness that's about to unfold.
[03:22:36.410 --> 03:22:38.531]  Because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready.
[03:22:38.531 --> 03:22:39.832]  So thank you all.
[03:22:39.832 --> 03:22:41.213]  And get into InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:22:41.213 --> 03:22:44.656]  Get some great 2020 election shirts, supplements, and so much more.
[03:22:44.656 --> 03:22:46.437]  They're wonderful products, and they support the InfoWars.
[03:22:46.437 --> 03:22:46.697]  Thank you.
[03:22:47.973 --> 03:22:49.534]  Gerald of South Carolina.
[03:22:49.534 --> 03:22:50.294]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[03:22:50.294 --> 03:22:51.034]  Trying to move quicker.
[03:22:51.034 --> 03:22:51.855]  Hey, Alex.
[03:22:51.855 --> 03:22:52.295]  Welcome.
[03:22:52.295 --> 03:22:57.457]  Would like to say, first off, thanks for being the voice of reason in amongst all this stupidity.
[03:22:57.457 --> 03:23:00.838]  Wanted to warn people, I've been trying to get a hold of you for a year, okay?
[03:23:00.838 --> 03:23:07.301]  I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away.
[03:23:07.301 --> 03:23:08.962]  Living Defense saved my life.
[03:23:08.962 --> 03:23:13.123]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[03:23:13.123 --> 03:23:14.564]  Living Defense brought me back.
[03:23:14.844 --> 03:23:20.368]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[03:23:20.368 --> 03:23:22.770]  This is Matthew 24 verse 9.
[03:23:22.770 --> 03:23:32.076]  Then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.
[03:23:32.076 --> 03:23:37.500]  And then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another.
[03:23:37.500 --> 03:23:39.041]  That's right where we're at brother.
[03:23:39.241 --> 03:23:44.967]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say, and that's why the enemy hates it.
[03:23:44.967 --> 03:23:46.749]  Because God created this country.
[03:23:48.206 --> 03:23:55.509]  The BioPros are the new non-GMO pollution solution, using eco-friendly products to treat everyday problems while supporting our environment.
[03:23:55.509 --> 03:24:02.312]  For the first time, the BioPros are bringing to the public market a suite of bioremediation products to the everyday consumer.
[03:24:02.312 --> 03:24:09.334]  Their first product they are launching is called BioSeptic Pro, a product specifically designed to establish a healthy septic system.
[03:24:09.334 --> 03:24:13.876]  BioSeptic Pro contains live microorganisms, not traditional enzymes like its competitors.
[03:24:14.136 --> 03:24:16.098]  This stuff lives in your septic system.
[03:24:16.098 --> 03:24:18.700]  It's really like probiotics for your septic tank.
[03:24:18.700 --> 03:24:20.541]  Say goodbye to septic problems.
[03:24:20.541 --> 03:24:23.083]  Gas buildup and odor guaranteed.
[03:24:23.083 --> 03:24:27.366]  BioSeptic Pro is light years ahead of traditional septic treatments.
[03:24:27.366 --> 03:24:34.611]  They have a revolutionary patented delivery system that carries live microorganisms to treat the problem at its core, making their products up to 100 times better.
[03:24:35.692 --> 03:24:38.514]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021.
[03:24:52.660 --> 03:24:53.781]  And I just want to say something.
[03:24:53.781 --> 03:24:58.545]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over the years.
[03:24:58.545 --> 03:25:03.489]  It is truly an answer to prayer, and I am so blessed and thankful for all of you, the listeners of this show.
[03:25:03.489 --> 03:25:06.392]  I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you.
[03:25:06.392 --> 03:25:09.734]  Whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter.
[03:25:09.734 --> 03:25:10.955]  You've got red blood.
[03:25:10.955 --> 03:25:20.724]  And if you love freedom and justice, and if you love our innocent children, we are brothers and sisters together, and it has just been an incredible experience to work with you over the years.
[03:25:21.424 --> 03:25:24.945]  And as crazy as things are, I want to keep working into the future.
[03:25:24.945 --> 03:25:28.166]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[03:25:28.166 --> 03:25:33.788]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us.
[03:25:33.788 --> 03:25:35.688]  Again, that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[03:25:35.688 --> 03:25:40.090]  I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've done.
[03:25:40.090 --> 03:25:43.711]  And just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you.
[03:25:43.711 --> 03:25:47.152]  And hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support InfoWars.
[03:25:47.152 --> 03:25:47.532]  God bless.
[03:25:51.451 --> 03:26:05.063]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:26:05.063 --> 03:26:06.924]  Watch me!
[03:26:06.924 --> 03:26:07.445]  Watch me!
[03:26:07.445 --> 03:26:14.511]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:26:14.511 --> 03:26:17.834]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer!
[03:26:21.145 --> 03:26:29.194]  The mainstream media is underreporting the side effects of COVID vaccines, some of which are potentially life-threatening.
[03:26:29.194 --> 03:26:36.543]  One America's Pearson Sharpe has more on the numbers behind those stories and the media's efforts to discredit negative news about the vaccines.
[03:26:37.805 --> 03:26:49.374]  From the very start of the pandemic, One America News has reported on the news the mainstream corporate media won't touch, such as the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine to treat the Chinese virus.
[03:26:49.374 --> 03:26:55.579]  OAN was viciously attacked for those reports, which have since been proven by the scientific community to be 100% accurate.
[03:26:57.940 --> 03:27:08.372]  Now, One America News is once again under fire for breaking the mainstream narrative and reporting on the troubling side effects caused by the various coronavirus vaccines.
[03:27:08.372 --> 03:27:18.103]  These include severe flu-like symptoms, diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, Bell's palsy, anaphylaxis, and shock, deadly heart inflammation, and even death.
[03:27:18.712 --> 03:27:29.401]  Cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome after receiving the Johnson & Johnson vaccine are also on the rise, with the CDC now investigating the potentially paralyzing side effect.
[03:27:29.401 --> 03:27:41.532]  But these clear, demonstrable cases of injuries caused by the vaccines aren't getting any attention in the media, and agencies like Reuters are even questioning OAN's reporting on the subject.
[03:27:41.532 --> 03:27:46.416]  So to dispel any questions and provide some background for our reports,
[03:27:47.139 --> 03:27:55.509]  Let me break down where our information comes from so that at least one news agency can provide some transparency on the vaccine.
[03:27:55.509 --> 03:28:05.421]  First of all, it has been claimed that using the VAERS website to report deaths and injuries from the vaccine is unreliable, since these reports are unconfirmed.
[03:28:05.421 --> 03:28:06.643]  That's only partially correct.
[03:28:07.378 --> 03:28:14.980]  The VAERS website is a government platform that collects and shares information about adverse side effects from any and all vaccines.
[03:28:14.980 --> 03:28:23.642]  And although these events are not confirmed, patients must sign a legal statement swearing to their accuracy before submitting their report.
[03:28:23.642 --> 03:28:34.145]  Additionally, many of these reports come straight from health care providers who are required, by law, to submit reports of injuries and deaths to the VAERS website.
[03:28:34.825 --> 03:28:42.892]  On top of that, vaccine manufacturers are also required by law to report all adverse side effects to VAERS.
[03:28:42.892 --> 03:28:50.598]  Reports like this from the Associated Press make it sound like it's just right-wing conspiracy theorists submitting these reports to VAERS.
[03:28:50.598 --> 03:29:02.027]  When in reality, it's actually a very serious process that's relied on by hospitals, vaccine manufacturers, and even the government to help decide which vaccines are safe and which aren't.
[03:29:03.161 --> 03:29:11.523]  One American News has also reported on the higher than average number of miscarriages being reported after pregnant mothers receive the vaccine.
[03:29:11.523 --> 03:29:14.784]  Reports which are dismissed by the mainstream media.
[03:29:14.784 --> 03:29:21.485]  And even the New England Journal of Medicine reported troublingly high numbers of miscarriages following vaccination.
[03:29:21.485 --> 03:29:31.828]  According to a report published by the journal in June, almost 14% of pregnant women who were given the coronavirus vaccine then suffered a miscarriage and lost their baby.
[03:29:32.412 --> 03:29:41.395]  That's backed up by data from VAERS again, which, as of July 13th, shows 985 miscarriages following the vaccine.
[03:29:41.395 --> 03:29:56.760]  Doctors speaking to One America News confirmed these reports, saying that pregnant women experienced numerous side effects, including myalgia, chills, fever, and lymphadenopathy, a swelling of the lymph nodes that showed up during abnormal mammograms, and is a warning sign for lymphoma.
[03:29:57.851 --> 03:30:07.174]  Next on the list of fact-checked reports involves the claim that there are more adverse side effects from the coronavirus vaccines than all other vaccines combined.
[03:30:07.174 --> 03:30:10.955]  Take a listen to our report from March 15th of this year.
[03:30:10.955 --> 03:30:17.797]  In the various report, 1,500 deaths related to the COVID vaccine.
[03:30:17.797 --> 03:30:23.319]  That's more adverse offense than any vaccines, all of them grouped together.
[03:30:24.159 --> 03:30:42.226]  So if you were to take all the vaccines in the world that we use, MMR, polio, okay, Hib, RSV, all of these vaccines, varicella vax, all of these, and you combine all of those vaccine adverse events, it's still less than what we're seeing with the COVID vaccines.
[03:30:43.613 --> 03:30:46.934]  So that tells me there's still some work to do.
[03:30:46.934 --> 03:30:50.175]  We also used data compiled from the VAERS website itself.
[03:30:50.175 --> 03:31:00.657]  From August 1st, 2007 to November 30th, 2020, a time period covering more than 13 years, the total number of all reported vaccine deaths was 3001.
[03:31:00.657 --> 03:31:03.218]  From December 1st of 2020 through July 13th of 2021, an eight-month period
[03:31:09.528 --> 03:31:14.212]  The total number of all COVID vaccine deaths is now over 9,000.
[03:31:14.212 --> 03:31:19.796]  And this data falls in line with data from the FDA and the CDC as well.
[03:31:19.796 --> 03:31:34.028]  That data states that from January 1, 1996 to March 31, 2021, the adverse events from the use of various medications like the flu vaccines, Tylenol, hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, dexamethasone, and remdesivir totaled 253,794.
[03:31:37.984 --> 03:31:50.652]  Meanwhile, from the same time period, the adverse events from all COVID vaccines totals 384,270, including 4,800 deaths.
[03:31:50.652 --> 03:31:57.396]  And this is all data collected from the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control.
[03:31:57.396 --> 03:32:05.781]  Lastly, we'd like to point out that these efforts to fact-check One America News may not be as open and transparent as they claim to be.
[03:32:06.445 --> 03:32:13.947]  The news agency Reuters reached out to us and sent us a list of facts they refuted in some of our reporting on the coronavirus vaccines.
[03:32:13.947 --> 03:32:30.872]  But while Reuters is trying to shut down reports that point out how dangerous vaccines from companies like Pfizer are, what they don't mention is that the CEO of Reuters, up until February of 2020, is now a member on the board of Pfizer.
[03:32:32.088 --> 03:32:40.331]  Which sort of adds up to have Reuters working hard to suppress any information about Pfizer's vaccine injuring or killing people.
[03:32:40.331 --> 03:32:47.113]  Not to mention that for its vaccine Pfizer received four billion dollars from the federal government.
[03:32:47.113 --> 03:32:55.416]  And the company says it expects to make another 26 billion dollars by selling the vaccine just this year.
[03:32:55.416 --> 03:32:56.416]  Is it any wonder
[03:32:57.068 --> 03:33:10.717]  That companies like Pfizer, with direct ties to the mainstream media, are exerting all the influence they can to make their vaccines look as good as possible, regardless the consequences to our health.
[03:33:10.717 --> 03:33:19.724]  Again, for the record, One America News is not promoting an anti-vaxxer position on this or any other vaccine for that matter.
[03:33:19.724 --> 03:33:26.128]  Vaccines have a proven track record of saving lives and curing diseases for over a century.
[03:33:27.153 --> 03:33:30.455]  But the cases we've mentioned here are real.
[03:33:30.455 --> 03:33:43.223]  As many doctors around the world have pointed out, it is reckless and dangerous to promote such a drug without at least trying to find answers to these very real questions.
[03:33:43.223 --> 03:33:46.025]  For One America News, I'm Pearson Sharpe.
[03:33:55.387 --> 03:33:57.008]  World Headquarters in Austin, Texas.
[03:33:57.008 --> 03:34:00.129]  Owen Troyer here for the final minute or so of this segment.
[03:34:00.129 --> 03:34:06.991]  I've got some big things coming up in the next segment, but really more importantly, the next three hours after that for the War Room.
[03:34:06.991 --> 03:34:13.673]  So when I come back from this break, I'm going to tell you what's coming up in the next three hours of the War Room.
[03:34:13.673 --> 03:34:19.735]  If this information can get out and go viral, we can save this country.
[03:34:19.735 --> 03:34:21.376]  And so that's where you come into play.
[03:34:22.000 --> 03:34:25.986]  You've done the deed that needed to be done to support InfoWars.
[03:34:25.986 --> 03:34:26.887]  Keep us on the air.
[03:34:26.887 --> 03:34:27.849]  And so here we are.
[03:34:27.849 --> 03:34:28.670]  We're expanding.
[03:34:28.670 --> 03:34:31.133]  We're live for 10 hours a day.
[03:34:31.133 --> 03:34:33.897]  That's all thanks to your support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:34:33.897 --> 03:34:35.540]  Your prayers, your words of encouragement, all of it.
[03:34:36.474 --> 03:34:38.816]  But folks, do not forget to share these links.
[03:34:38.816 --> 03:34:41.178]  Do not forget to tell friends and family to tune in.
[03:34:41.178 --> 03:34:43.500]  People are hungry for this information more than ever.
[03:34:43.500 --> 03:34:45.021]  They're hungry for the truth more than ever.
[03:34:45.021 --> 03:35:02.035]  They can see how corrupt the world is, how corrupt the government is, how corrupt Biden is, all of this stuff, but you need to share the links so they can see the info and try to make sense of it all as we lay it out with the constellation of news and events with the backdrop of history and then, of course, InfoWars foresight, which has been proven to be the best in media.
[03:35:03.283 --> 03:35:09.125]  Remember though, we have supplements at Infowarsstore.com that you need, like greens fiber caps.
[03:35:09.125 --> 03:35:11.806]  Now, I'm actually really excited about this.
[03:35:11.806 --> 03:35:18.028]  I've been, I've taken, we'll say greens capsules for a while.
[03:35:19.022 --> 03:35:21.324]  Vegetable capsules, all kinds of different stuff.
[03:35:21.324 --> 03:35:23.825]  So, when I heard about this, I said, oh, that's a great thing.
[03:35:23.825 --> 03:35:24.786]  This is really popular.
[03:35:24.786 --> 03:35:26.327]  People will really be into this.
[03:35:26.327 --> 03:35:35.774]  And then I read the ingredients, and I was absolutely blown away with the ingredients in our new Greens Fiber Caps at Infowarsstore.com, made with organic vegetables.

[03:36:50.992 --> 03:36:52.073]  Granny do right.
[03:36:52.073 --> 03:36:53.094]  Thanks for watching.
[03:36:55.606 --> 03:36:57.748]  Well, let me say, I love your products.
[03:36:57.748 --> 03:37:08.460]  I am a granny, and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots, or age spots, as they're lovingly called.
[03:37:08.460 --> 03:37:14.487]  But since taking Eurex II for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous, actually.
[03:37:14.487 --> 03:37:15.488]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[03:37:17.750 --> 03:37:25.476]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[03:37:25.476 --> 03:37:34.243]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket.
[03:37:34.243 --> 03:37:35.064]  This is working.
[03:37:35.064 --> 03:37:36.005]  This is wonderful.
[03:37:36.005 --> 03:37:40.588]  You know, I don't, I don't have to put on Dermablend anymore, you know?
[03:37:40.588 --> 03:37:45.232]  So anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[03:37:48.286 --> 03:37:56.448]  I preach about the dangers of cell phones all day long because they're supercomputers controlled by big tech that are spying on us everywhere we go and what we do.
[03:37:56.448 --> 03:38:05.230]  But because they have great cameras and great recording systems and great ways to communicate, I still have one because this Trojan horse, this Promethean Fire, has a lot of power.
[03:38:05.230 --> 03:38:12.171]  But when I'm not using it, I lock it up in a high-quality Faraday cage, a privacy pocket, at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:38:12.171 --> 03:38:14.791]  We finally got them back in stock, the highest rated.
[03:38:14.791 --> 03:38:17.232]  They fit almost all types of Androids and iPhones.
[03:38:17.672 --> 03:38:18.193]  I think?
[03:38:47.452 --> 03:38:52.115]  Alex Jones here with two big announcements in the next 60 seconds.
[03:38:52.115 --> 03:38:54.596]  First off, green fiber capsules.
[03:38:54.596 --> 03:38:59.459]  Highest quality fiber you're going to find with all the amino acids and a ton of vitamins and minerals.
[03:38:59.459 --> 03:39:00.959]  This is an incredible formula.
[03:39:00.959 --> 03:39:02.380]  Everybody should be taking it.
[03:39:02.380 --> 03:39:05.362]  Men, women, children, old, young, black, white, it doesn't matter.
[03:39:05.362 --> 03:39:06.482]  It's an amazing product.
[03:39:06.482 --> 03:39:07.323]  It's our newest product.

[03:39:51.058 --> 03:39:53.721]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:40:07.050 --> 03:40:14.114]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:40:14.114 --> 03:40:18.016]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[03:40:18.016 --> 03:40:26.821]  Alright, I'm going to use this last segment of the Alex Jones Show to tell you what's coming up on the War Room today.
[03:40:26.821 --> 03:40:30.443]  And that way I can really try to just get into the information on the War Room.
[03:40:31.623 --> 03:40:35.767]  Coming up here in 13 minutes.
[03:40:35.767 --> 03:40:48.159]  But, you know, you've got now Geraldo Rivera coming out and he says that he wants mandated vaccines.
[03:40:48.159 --> 03:40:53.243]  And so you use that as an example of the mainstream news approach to things.
[03:40:53.243 --> 03:40:57.047]  Is Geraldo Rivera just a tyrant who likes medical tyranny?
[03:40:58.476 --> 03:41:03.600]  Or does Geraldo Rivera know where the bread is buttered at Fox News?
[03:41:03.600 --> 03:41:20.093]  And he says, I might as well suck up to Big Pharma, I might as well shill for the vaccines, I might as well go with mandatory vaccines, because, hell, I want to be on the air next year when they force it, and I want to say, see, I was for medical tyranny, I'm a good mainstream news... I'm a good mainstream newsman.
[03:41:23.644 --> 03:41:41.529]  So, as if the awakening by conservatives, Trump supporters, and American patriots to Geraldo Rivera hasn't been enough of a phenomenon over the last six or so months with his spats with Dan Bongino and all the other stuff that's been going on, this will be the cake.
[03:41:41.529 --> 03:41:52.752]  And it's so great to see OAN, who's on cable news, filing reports like that, that quite frankly are more palatable
[03:41:53.886 --> 03:41:59.370]  And a little easier to swallow than the InfoWars approach to things.
[03:41:59.370 --> 03:42:03.212]  InfoWars is like the super red pill, like a horse pill.
[03:42:03.212 --> 03:42:05.193]  It's like, you know, it's kind of tough to swallow.
[03:42:05.193 --> 03:42:07.074]  Some people don't want to swallow it, didn't they?
[03:42:07.074 --> 03:42:13.778]  But OAN, like they deliver it nice and it's fashionable and it looks like it's very professional and it's all scripted and they have their stuff.
[03:42:13.778 --> 03:42:15.760]  And so that's an easier thing to swallow.
[03:42:15.760 --> 03:42:16.820]  That's more palatable.
[03:42:16.820 --> 03:42:18.561]  Thank God that's on TV.
[03:42:18.561 --> 03:42:21.123]  Thank God there's a news organization out there
[03:42:22.153 --> 03:42:28.299]  That mainstream Republicans will say is a good source, telling the truth about these vaccines.
[03:42:28.299 --> 03:42:34.205]  Meanwhile, in France where they announced, Macron the other day announced, oh we're going to have mandatory vaccines.
[03:42:34.205 --> 03:42:36.347]  You have massive uprisings happening.
[03:42:37.208 --> 03:42:42.191]  And it reminds me actually of the Yellow Jacket protests that we saw some years ago.
[03:42:42.191 --> 03:42:48.694]  By the way, Dan Lyman from InfoWars Europe is going to be joining me on the War Room at 4 o'clock Central, so the second hour.
[03:42:48.694 --> 03:42:55.198]  Certainly we'll be talking about that and as the group shows all this footage here, be going over all this footage as well.
[03:42:55.198 --> 03:42:57.979]  So that's big news.
[03:42:57.979 --> 03:43:04.703]  But I gotta say, we are finally getting some truly hardcore
[03:43:05.939 --> 03:43:09.522]  information out of the Georgia audit.
[03:43:09.522 --> 03:43:13.324]  We've been told what they found in the Arizona audit.
[03:43:13.324 --> 03:43:16.847]  We've been told, but they haven't shown us.
[03:43:16.847 --> 03:43:18.628]  They haven't shown it to us.
[03:43:18.628 --> 03:43:27.254]  We are now seeing what the audit in Fulton County, Georgia has revealed.
[03:43:27.254 --> 03:43:31.597]  Yesterday they released a video that proves unequivocally
[03:43:32.879 --> 03:43:37.081]  That they were double scanning, maybe triple scanning, who knows.
[03:43:37.081 --> 03:43:41.663]  They're just going over these scans now from Fulton County of the ballots.
[03:43:41.663 --> 03:43:50.106]  And it's true, as the eyewitness testimony sworn affidavit said, they were double, triple, quadruple counting ballots in Georgia.
[03:43:50.106 --> 03:43:51.126]  In Atlanta specifically.
[03:43:51.126 --> 03:43:54.608]  Now, the crew rolls this video.
[03:43:54.608 --> 03:43:56.428]  Let me explain this.
[03:43:56.428 --> 03:44:00.070]  The Democrats took a gamble that was a pretty easy one to know you're going to win.
[03:44:01.391 --> 03:44:07.814]  And they said, we believe that in Atlanta, Joe Biden is going to get more votes than Trump.
[03:44:07.814 --> 03:44:15.837]  And of course, it was with Mark Zuckerberg where they were running their voter initiative drives just to make sure.
[03:44:15.837 --> 03:44:18.738]  So that was illegal, by the way, that Zuckerberg did.
[03:44:18.738 --> 03:44:29.763]  So Zuckerberg, with the Democrats, working with the Democrats, spent hundreds of millions of dollars going into Democrat run inner cities to find the places
[03:44:30.678 --> 03:44:41.864]  That to kind of do a probe, a little recon mission, to find the places that would be the best bet to double, triple scan ballots.
[03:44:41.864 --> 03:44:50.829]  Because you can double, triple scan ballots, but unless you know that your candidate is going to be favored in those districts, well then it doesn't do you any good.
[03:44:50.829 --> 03:44:55.332]  If you think Trump is going to have more votes in that district than Biden, then double scanning ballots doesn't do any good.
[03:44:56.013 --> 03:45:05.818]  So they sent Zuckerberg out like a scout, like a sports scout before a draft to find the best cities, which they already had a good idea.
[03:45:05.818 --> 03:45:09.940]  That's why Zuckerberg went to Atlanta and Detroit and Philadelphia and all these other places.
[03:45:09.940 --> 03:45:13.942]  They already knew where the Democrat strongholds were, where they could get away with election theft.
[03:45:13.942 --> 03:45:19.104]  But they had to know, they had to be positive, folks, that they had to steal this election.
[03:45:21.016 --> 03:45:29.743]  And there's a new element of this with the vaccines too, but we'll focus on why they had to get Biden in, but let's focus on this right now.
[03:45:29.743 --> 03:45:43.573]  So they released the video of their scans, they released the video, not hearsay, showing you the audit results that they were double counting, triple counting, quadruple counting ballots in Atlanta because they knew
[03:45:44.725 --> 03:45:53.333]  Joe Biden would have more votes in that district than Trump, based on the research they did with Mark Zuckerberg the entire calendar year.
[03:45:53.333 --> 03:45:58.457]  They did the same thing in Philadelphia, Detroit, Milwaukee, you can bet on it.
[03:45:58.457 --> 03:45:59.819]  Arizona, you can bet on it.
[03:45:59.819 --> 03:46:01.700]  They did everything they could to steal this election.
[03:46:01.700 --> 03:46:03.602]  They had to.
[03:46:03.602 --> 03:46:08.907]  They had to have their candidate in there to advance the new world order to the next phase.
[03:46:10.109 --> 03:46:12.390]  Donald Trump is not part of this, folks.
[03:46:12.390 --> 03:46:14.472]  I have people all the time saying Trump's a part of it.
[03:46:14.472 --> 03:46:15.532]  He fooled you.
[03:46:15.532 --> 03:46:16.433]  Trump's not perfect.
[03:46:16.433 --> 03:46:17.553]  Trump's made a lot of mistakes.
[03:46:17.553 --> 03:46:19.394]  Sometimes I'm going to be a cheerleader for Trump.
[03:46:19.394 --> 03:46:22.576]  Sometimes I'm going to boo and hiss and say he sucks.
[03:46:22.576 --> 03:46:24.918]  But he's not out to get us.
[03:46:24.918 --> 03:46:26.018]  He's made mistakes.
[03:46:26.018 --> 03:46:27.059]  He's not perfect.
[03:46:27.059 --> 03:46:30.761]  He was surrounded.
[03:46:30.761 --> 03:46:32.662]  So what do we have today?
[03:46:32.662 --> 03:46:34.823]  Oh, the crew has already pulled it up.
[03:46:34.823 --> 03:46:35.764]  So today,
[03:46:36.599 --> 03:46:38.700]  And this is the big one, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:46:38.700 --> 03:46:41.822]  This is the whopper.
[03:46:41.822 --> 03:46:43.362]  This is the Moby Dick.
[03:46:43.362 --> 03:46:48.165]  This is the whole enchilada.
[03:46:48.165 --> 03:46:58.790]  In Georgia, the Democrats figured if they were double scanning or triple scanning, whatever they needed to do in Atlanta, they figured that that would be enough to beat Donald Trump.
[03:46:58.790 --> 03:47:00.391]  It wasn't.
[03:47:00.391 --> 03:47:01.511]  It wasn't.
[03:47:01.511 --> 03:47:03.532]  So they had a backup plan.
[03:47:03.532 --> 03:47:04.373]  And my guess is,
[03:47:05.572 --> 03:47:16.864]  I think it's a fair guess based on the results because just like in Georgia where the graph went straight up for Biden, you saw the same thing in Pennsylvania, in Wisconsin, in Michigan.
[03:47:16.864 --> 03:47:20.248]  So they ran that operation everywhere.
[03:47:20.248 --> 03:47:21.329]  It's just not confirmed yet.
[03:47:21.329 --> 03:47:23.111]  But now we have it confirmed in Georgia.
[03:47:24.429 --> 03:47:39.012]  So they figured, we'll have enough votes if we're double scanning the ballots, these packets of ballots, and we know in Atlanta that Biden's going to get more votes than Trump, so we'll just try to amplify that margin by double, triple, quadruple scanning.
[03:47:39.012 --> 03:47:40.212]  That was proven yesterday.
[03:47:40.212 --> 03:47:44.533]  But here's the thing, they had a backup plan, because again, like I told you, they could not lose this election.
[03:47:44.533 --> 03:47:46.133]  They could not.
[03:47:46.133 --> 03:47:49.614]  So what was the backup plan if that didn't work?
[03:47:49.614 --> 03:47:53.915]  They had cases of ballots, and we saw the video of this,
[03:47:54.733 --> 03:48:06.758]  Cases of ballots ready to go in the circumstance that double scanning the ballots in the city of Atlanta in Fulton County wouldn't be enough to overcome Trump's margin of victory.
[03:48:06.758 --> 03:48:17.903]  So they had all these backup illegal fake ballots in crates in Fulton County ready to go and at the end of the night when Trump was ahead
[03:48:18.917 --> 03:48:27.099]  They went with plan B. So they shut down the polling locations and they made up a water main break as the excuse.
[03:48:27.099 --> 03:48:31.840]  Then the corrupt Democrat criminals came in that have been ID'd, they're all Democrat operatives.
[03:48:31.840 --> 03:48:35.761]  They came in when the polling place was supposed to be closed.
[03:48:35.761 --> 03:48:40.422]  They came in, this is all on video, on the security tape, they pulled out
[03:48:41.070 --> 03:48:43.752]  The case is of fake illegal ballots.
[03:48:43.752 --> 03:48:46.774]  They pulled them out and they started counting them.
[03:48:46.774 --> 03:48:49.536]  Now, these were quote-unquote absentee ballots.
[03:48:49.536 --> 03:48:56.361]  And remember, we had sworn affidavit, eyewitness testimony saying these could not have been legitimate ballots.
[03:48:56.361 --> 03:48:57.842]  There was no crease.
[03:48:57.842 --> 03:48:59.143]  They came from the same address.
[03:48:59.143 --> 03:49:01.304]  They had the same penmanship on all of them.
[03:49:01.304 --> 03:49:02.425]  So they already knew they were illegal.
[03:49:02.425 --> 03:49:03.746]  But now we know the plan.
[03:49:03.746 --> 03:49:06.408]  So they audited those votes.
[03:49:06.408 --> 03:49:08.569]  And guess what they discovered?
[03:49:08.569 --> 03:49:10.591]  Well, how would you possibly have
[03:49:11.670 --> 03:49:21.293]  In an election, on a vote graph over time, with time and votes on a line graph, how would you possibly have a line that goes straight up?
[03:49:21.293 --> 03:49:28.776]  Well, you'd have to have thousands of ballots that you counted, and they all had a vote for Biden on them.
[03:49:28.776 --> 03:49:30.176]  Well, guess what, ladies and gentlemen?
[03:49:30.176 --> 03:49:34.157]  We now have the audit, and we now have the numbers.
[03:49:34.157 --> 03:49:38.019]  When they ran their campaign, their fake news, to close the polling place,
[03:49:39.978 --> 03:49:45.002]  And those absentee ballots that they counted after it was all said and done, we now have the numbers.
[03:49:45.002 --> 03:49:48.564]  They were 100% for Joe Biden.
[03:49:48.564 --> 03:49:58.011]  Every single absentee ballot in the packets was every single vote, 100% for Joe Biden.
[03:49:58.011 --> 03:50:00.873]  Every single one.
[03:50:00.873 --> 03:50:02.895]  Every single one.
[03:50:03.832 --> 03:50:12.541]  Now again, we've been telling you this for months because we have a brain, we can put two and two together, we have common sense, we have logic and reasoning, and we know how corrupt our elections are.
[03:50:12.541 --> 03:50:15.924]  But it's pretty obvious, when a line graph goes straight up...
[03:50:16.681 --> 03:50:19.843]  That means that everything came in for that one thing.
[03:50:19.843 --> 03:50:21.644]  We now have the ballots.
[03:50:21.644 --> 03:50:25.086]  We now caught the Democrats red-handed in Fulton County.
[03:50:25.086 --> 03:50:25.866]  They cheated.
[03:50:25.866 --> 03:50:27.007]  They stole this election.
[03:50:27.007 --> 03:50:29.088]  Donald Trump won Georgia, and they know it.
[03:50:29.088 --> 03:50:32.250]  And now they're really panicked about what's going on in Pennsylvania.
[03:50:32.250 --> 03:50:33.831]  I'm going to cover it coming up on The War Room.
