[03:31.840 --> 03:36.840]  I want to be crazy crazy like Alex Jones
[03:36.840 --> 03:42.840]  I went looking one day on the internet just to see what I could buy
[03:42.840 --> 03:47.840]  when I heard this talk show maniac just proudly speaking his mind
[03:47.840 --> 03:52.840]  it was real wild but the more I heard it made a whole lot of sense to me
[03:52.840 --> 03:58.840]  I want to thank you Alex for opening my eyes and helping the clowns to see
[03:58.840 --> 04:04.840]  I want to be crazy crazy like Alex Jones

[05:59.840 --> 06:04.840]  Hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds
[06:04.840 --> 06:06.840]  and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle
[06:06.840 --> 06:11.840]  did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold
[06:11.840 --> 06:14.840]  it's true seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country
[06:14.840 --> 06:17.840]  and it's possible that could even happen again
[06:17.840 --> 06:22.840]  so our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds
[06:22.840 --> 06:24.840]  they call it a survival seed bank
[06:24.840 --> 06:29.840]  and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family
[06:29.840 --> 06:33.840]  and here's the best part these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way
[06:33.840 --> 06:37.840]  and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden
[06:37.840 --> 06:40.840]  so visit them today at survivalseedbank.com
[06:40.840 --> 06:42.840]  that's survivalseedbank.com

[06:47.840 --> 06:51.840]  that's 877-327-0365
[06:51.840 --> 06:56.840]  remember in a real crisis non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item
[06:56.840 --> 06:59.840]  this is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com
[06:59.840 --> 07:04.840]  you've heard Alex explain how the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system
[07:04.840 --> 07:07.840]  with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions
[07:07.840 --> 07:10.840]  yet many are unaware of the entire function of the silver lung system
[07:10.840 --> 07:15.840]  and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body
[07:15.840 --> 07:20.840]  my name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the developer of the silver lungs generator
[07:20.840 --> 07:24.840]  not only does the silver lung system produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions
[07:24.840 --> 07:28.840]  it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed
[07:28.840 --> 07:32.840]  to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas
[07:32.840 --> 07:38.840]  this includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin
[07:38.840 --> 07:40.840]  and orally for the digestive system
[07:40.840 --> 07:44.840]  be sure to watch our new 7 minute video tour of the silver lung system

[07:55.840 --> 07:59.840]  that's www.silverlungs.com
[08:25.840 --> 08:36.840]  it is Tuesday my friends
[08:36.840 --> 08:42.840]  the 7th day of August 2012
[08:42.840 --> 08:46.840]  you have found at the tip of the spear in the Info War
[08:46.840 --> 08:51.840]  worldwide to awaken the people of the planet to the scientific tyranny
[08:51.840 --> 08:54.840]  known as the New World Order
[08:54.840 --> 08:57.840]  thank you so much for joining us today
[08:57.840 --> 09:00.840]  we are going to be here for the next three hours
[09:00.840 --> 09:04.840]  and what I want to do is open the phones up in this hour
[09:04.840 --> 09:08.840]  ahead of William Gregg who writes for the New American Magazine
[09:08.840 --> 09:10.840]  and Lou Rockwell.com
[09:10.840 --> 09:14.840]  he is going to be joining us to talk about the drone culture
[09:14.840 --> 09:20.840]  the submarine drones, the aircraft drones, the ground combat robots
[09:20.840 --> 09:24.840]  and where all of this is leading
[09:24.840 --> 09:27.840]  and I want to break down basically how we are allowing ourselves
[09:27.840 --> 09:32.840]  humans want to unionize in things so other humans can't drive down their wages
[09:32.840 --> 09:36.840]  what about machines and pre-programmed machines
[09:36.840 --> 09:39.840]  and out of the gates the takeover by machines
[09:39.840 --> 09:42.840]  because always the cutting edge of technology is weapons
[09:42.840 --> 09:46.840]  is going to be unmanned and autonomous robots
[09:46.840 --> 09:50.840]  and the discussion will also get his take on the shooting
[09:50.840 --> 09:53.840]  he's broken down the fact that not just the general public
[09:53.840 --> 09:58.840]  but police have been caught on video beating the living daylights out of Sikhs
[09:58.840 --> 10:03.840]  I guess thinking they are the Al Qaeda archetype when it's the opposite group basically
[10:03.840 --> 10:09.840]  and there was one case where a Sikh was beat up in his own front yard by a police officer
[10:09.840 --> 10:14.840]  on video and for putting his hands over his face as he was being stomped in it
[10:14.840 --> 10:19.840]  with a baton he was found that he was resisting arrest
[10:19.840 --> 10:23.840]  and the courts have ruled that if you cover your teeth as they are being kicked in
[10:23.840 --> 10:26.840]  you are going to go to prison
[10:26.840 --> 10:31.840]  and this is all just the icing on the cake for a society on the verge of total collapse
[10:31.840 --> 10:37.840]  we obviously have a lot of news on the situation that took place
[10:37.840 --> 10:43.840]  Sunday there in Wisconsin
[10:43.840 --> 10:47.840]  the evidence points towards Operation Gladio
[10:47.840 --> 10:54.840]  or a NATO option as it was also known being incrementally implemented here in the United States
[10:54.840 --> 10:58.840]  we are going to be breaking all of that down as well today
[10:58.840 --> 11:04.840]  and I also want to spend some time on all of the pecking that's going on by government
[11:04.840 --> 11:09.840]  to make sure it's milk cows, it's slaves, it's blood bags
[11:09.840 --> 11:14.840]  and things the Mosquito class, the parasite class feeds off of
[11:14.840 --> 11:20.840]  they are very upset right now because well people are selling tomatoes on street corners
[11:20.840 --> 11:23.840]  and lemons and things like that
[11:23.840 --> 11:28.840]  and I also saw reports over the weekend all over the United States and Canada
[11:28.840 --> 11:32.840]  they are saying no gardens even in rural areas, they are evil
[11:32.840 --> 11:35.840]  they are not allowed slaves, aren't allowed to grow plants
[11:35.840 --> 11:39.840]  I mean you don't allow prisoners to grow gardens, you don't allow families to have farms
[11:39.840 --> 11:45.840]  you don't allow the owners of fast food chains to have political views
[11:45.840 --> 11:47.840]  you don't do that in America
[11:47.840 --> 11:52.840]  this is land of the torture home of the slave, this is land of the GMO
[11:52.840 --> 12:00.840]  this is land of the sterile, land of the cancer, land of the organ failure, land of the cursed, land of the dead
[12:00.840 --> 12:06.840]  you see the new world order wants to persecute those who have committed crimes against evil
[12:06.840 --> 12:11.840]  crimes against evil
[12:11.840 --> 12:14.840]  that's not a joke
[12:14.840 --> 12:20.840]  they want to persecute and prosecute and destroy anyone who is wholesome and good
[12:20.840 --> 12:29.840]  because in their evil takeover it's anathema, it's like crosses or holy water or garlic
[12:29.840 --> 12:33.840]  to a vampire
[12:33.840 --> 12:38.840]  as long as we are a strong, upright, focused, conscious population
[12:38.840 --> 12:40.840]  they can't cross the threshold
[12:40.840 --> 12:47.840]  but if they can spiritually and culturally shell us on giving in to evil
[12:47.840 --> 12:49.840]  then the sky is the limit
[12:49.840 --> 12:54.840]  once we think evil is cute, once we think corruption is cute
[12:54.840 --> 12:56.840]  once we buy into things like that
[12:56.840 --> 13:03.840]  the fields are down and we are wide open
[13:03.840 --> 13:10.840]  here is the toll free number to join us on any of the issues that Mike Adams did a great job covering yesterday
[13:10.840 --> 13:14.840]  along with myself calling in and the crew here
[13:14.840 --> 13:21.840]  we would love to hear from you today on geopolitical developments on all of it
[13:21.840 --> 13:25.840]  I will, after I give the number out
[13:25.840 --> 13:30.840]  let's start breaking down the situation as best I can
[13:30.840 --> 13:35.840]  in Wisconsin
[13:35.840 --> 13:49.840]  the toll free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231-800259-9231
[13:49.840 --> 13:57.840]  we will go to your phone calls here coming up at the start of the next segment
[13:57.840 --> 14:03.840]  but let me now just start with the basics
[14:03.840 --> 14:06.840]  you have an election year
[14:06.840 --> 14:09.840]  and you have Obama behind in the polls
[14:09.840 --> 14:15.840]  you have Obama run and finance basically by banker and Chicago mafia
[14:15.840 --> 14:21.840]  you have Obama and his surrogates in three different fundraising letters
[14:21.840 --> 14:25.840]  and in an article in the Financial Times of London
[14:25.840 --> 14:27.840]  Paul Watson links to this
[14:27.840 --> 14:31.840]  in his Sikh temple shooter was an army psychological operations
[14:31.840 --> 14:35.840]  Batman shooter James Hones was also connected to military psychiatrist
[14:35.840 --> 14:38.840]  yeah, top psychiatrist
[14:38.840 --> 14:42.840]  in that report we linked to the articles, to the videos
[14:42.840 --> 14:45.840]  there's actually more than four
[14:45.840 --> 14:49.840]  three different fundraisers, one article and then another statement
[14:49.840 --> 14:54.840]  two statements on hardball Chris Matthews by Democratic top advisors
[14:54.840 --> 14:57.840]  so that's four, five, six
[14:57.840 --> 15:00.840]  six incidences in the last two years of them saying
[15:00.840 --> 15:03.840]  a mass shooting would really help Obama
[15:03.840 --> 15:07.840]  this is hardball, slimeball
[15:07.840 --> 15:11.840]  because it would let him reconnect with the public
[15:11.840 --> 15:14.840]  and then you have the fundraisers saying
[15:14.840 --> 15:17.840]  don't worry if he gets behind the polls before the election
[15:17.840 --> 15:19.840]  because our projections show he will
[15:19.840 --> 15:21.840]  there'll be a mass shooting or a bombing
[15:21.840 --> 15:24.840]  and it'll be blamed on domestic groups
[15:24.840 --> 15:27.840]  and we've read these articles, we've played these clips there at nauseam
[15:27.840 --> 15:29.840]  if you're a new listener
[15:29.840 --> 15:34.840]  go read the article, follow the links to it
[15:34.840 --> 15:38.840]  and then this stuff starts happening right on time
[15:38.840 --> 15:41.840]  while they've got five bills introduced
[15:41.840 --> 15:43.840]  to ban all semi-autos, the possession of them
[15:43.840 --> 15:46.840]  not just the sale or manufacture
[15:46.840 --> 15:49.840]  to ban clips with more than ten rounds
[15:49.840 --> 15:52.840]  to ban online ammo sales to register you when you buy guns
[15:52.840 --> 15:54.840]  the list goes on and on
[15:54.840 --> 15:57.840]  to allow the government to just restrict you owning guns
[15:57.840 --> 15:58.840]  no judge, no jury
[15:58.840 --> 16:01.840]  not like felons with the 68 gun control act
[16:01.840 --> 16:05.840]  it's a nightmare, we've never seen such draconian bills
[16:05.840 --> 16:07.840]  and the media's gotten slick
[16:07.840 --> 16:09.840]  they've learned just to not promote the bills
[16:09.840 --> 16:11.840]  used to they'd introduce them and promote them
[16:11.840 --> 16:12.840]  and say we need to pass them
[16:12.840 --> 16:15.840]  they've gotten more sophisticated
[16:15.840 --> 16:20.840]  they have now come out
[16:20.840 --> 16:24.840]  and aren't discussing it
[16:24.840 --> 16:27.840]  or they say we don't want your guns
[16:27.840 --> 16:29.840]  we don't want your guns
[16:29.840 --> 16:30.840]  you've won the debate
[16:30.840 --> 16:32.840]  we agree there's a second amendment
[16:32.840 --> 16:35.840]  it means a powder, black powder
[16:35.840 --> 16:37.840]  flint lock, muzzle loader
[16:37.840 --> 16:40.840]  how does that sound?
[16:40.840 --> 16:43.840]  that's what they've done
[16:43.840 --> 16:46.840]  so they're playing a psychological warfare operation
[16:46.840 --> 16:49.840]  and then magically right on time this happens
[16:49.840 --> 16:53.840]  now if you go over homes
[16:53.840 --> 17:00.840]  or you go over this new individual
[17:00.840 --> 17:02.840]  if you look at it
[17:02.840 --> 17:05.840]  it fits exactly what we predicted
[17:05.840 --> 17:06.840]  it's not hard to do
[17:06.840 --> 17:09.840]  and there's so many data points
[17:09.840 --> 17:11.840]  backing up the fact that this is the beginning
[17:11.840 --> 17:13.840]  of an Operation Gladio or NATO option
[17:13.840 --> 17:15.840]  here in the United States
[17:15.840 --> 17:18.840]  because we know it's been used in Europe
[17:18.840 --> 17:20.840]  to take the guns in England and Australia
[17:20.840 --> 17:22.840]  and in New Zealand
[17:22.840 --> 17:23.840]  this has been done over and over again
[17:23.840 --> 17:26.840]  and we've followed all these past cases
[17:26.840 --> 17:27.840]  and we know the playbook
[17:27.840 --> 17:31.840]  that private globalist mercenary organizations carry out
[17:31.840 --> 17:39.840]  and we also know the playbook
[17:39.840 --> 17:45.840]  we also know the playbook
[17:45.840 --> 17:47.840]  that has been used by governments
[17:47.840 --> 17:51.840]  and we even have things like Operation Northwoods
[17:51.840 --> 17:56.840]  that describes how to shoot U.S. citizens
[17:56.840 --> 17:57.840]  and then how to blame Patsy's
[17:57.840 --> 17:59.840]  and that's a Pentagon green-lighted plan
[17:59.840 --> 18:01.840]  all the way up to the president
[18:01.840 --> 18:03.840]  and then we have Gladio and the NATO option
[18:03.840 --> 18:05.840]  both the same thing
[18:05.840 --> 18:07.840]  hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
[18:07.840 --> 18:09.840]  and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
[18:09.840 --> 18:11.840]  some estimates will confirm it's over 200
[18:11.840 --> 18:14.840]  but overall 500 are suspected
[18:14.840 --> 18:16.840]  to have been NATO carried out terror attacks
[18:16.840 --> 18:18.840]  and mass shootings in Europe
[18:18.840 --> 18:21.840]  in the 60s, 70s and 80s
[18:21.840 --> 18:29.840]  to blame political enemies of the globalist
[18:29.840 --> 18:30.840]  so I'll go to your calls at the bottom of the hour
[18:30.840 --> 18:32.840]  I need to come back and cover this
[18:32.840 --> 18:33.840]  we're going to go to break
[18:33.840 --> 18:35.840]  and I'm going to get a drink of water here
[18:35.840 --> 18:37.840]  and we're going to try to go over all of this
[18:37.840 --> 18:41.840]  thank you got my water
[18:41.840 --> 18:44.840]  forgot to get one
[18:44.840 --> 18:46.840]  thank you
[18:46.840 --> 18:50.840]  but I don't just come on air
[18:50.840 --> 18:53.840]  and say oh this is an inside job
[18:53.840 --> 18:55.840]  I've learned all the signs
[18:55.840 --> 18:58.840]  and these are sloppy operations
[18:58.840 --> 19:01.840]  these don't count on these things being carried out
[19:01.840 --> 19:06.840]  with precision like fantasy, mission impossible or something
[19:06.840 --> 19:14.840]  these things all count on control of the media
[19:14.840 --> 19:16.840]  control the media and control of the first story
[19:16.840 --> 19:18.840]  to come out from the beginning
[19:18.840 --> 19:20.840]  it doesn't matter what really happened
[19:20.840 --> 19:23.840]  as long as you can put out the first narrative
[19:23.840 --> 19:26.840]  and keep that quote trust with the public
[19:26.840 --> 19:29.840]  and the public doesn't trust the system anymore
[19:29.840 --> 19:34.840]  but they still are naive about just how evil these globalists are
[19:34.840 --> 19:36.840]  so I'm going to try to break this down
[19:36.840 --> 19:38.840]  just very very simply
[19:38.840 --> 19:41.840]  on the other side and then we'll go to your phone calls
[19:41.840 --> 19:46.840]  Eli, Michael, Stephen, Julio

[19:49.840 --> 19:51.840]  and when we do go to your calls

[24:11.840 --> 24:26.840]  okay so if you're a new listener and you tune in yesterday and you hear Mike Adams on the show
[24:26.840 --> 24:29.840]  the health ranger you hear Alex Jones calling in
[24:29.840 --> 24:32.840]  his own radio broadcast saying it's an inside job
[24:32.840 --> 24:35.840]  a false flag a staged event
[24:35.840 --> 24:38.840]  you probably don't know it's in US Army manuals
[24:38.840 --> 24:42.840]  that were leaked by WikiLeaks and the Army admitted that indeed
[24:42.840 --> 24:46.840]  they do teach people in special operations in select groups
[24:46.840 --> 24:50.840]  how to stage false flags
[24:50.840 --> 24:55.840]  you probably didn't know there's countless declassified instances of our military
[24:55.840 --> 24:58.840]  going around the world and shooting up schools
[24:58.840 --> 25:02.840]  school buses you name it to blame it on their political enemies
[25:02.840 --> 25:04.840]  because that's how you win wars
[25:04.840 --> 25:09.840]  if you're just giving over to Machiavelli and worldview then justifies the means
[25:09.840 --> 25:14.840]  a new listener probably doesn't know that Hitler firebombed his own Reichstag to take over
[25:14.840 --> 25:18.840]  or launched attacks on his own military bases in 1939 at Gliwitz
[25:18.840 --> 25:25.840]  as part of Operation Himmler false flag attacks all over their border to blame Poland
[25:25.840 --> 25:29.840]  but see I live the real world so I know what these things look like
[25:29.840 --> 25:32.840]  and then you've got our own government doing this countless times
[25:32.840 --> 25:37.840]  you've got Obama's top advisors saying terror attacks are coming
[25:37.840 --> 25:40.840]  and the right wing is going to be blamed
[25:40.840 --> 25:45.840]  aiming the real right wing the anti-new world order crowd
[25:45.840 --> 25:49.840]  and then you have the Batman shooting and the instant hype
[25:49.840 --> 25:53.840]  and the military top psychiatrist and the guy himself
[25:53.840 --> 25:58.840]  is in a mind control grant looking at areas of neural manipulation
[25:58.840 --> 26:01.840]  at the highest levels of a DARPA contract
[26:01.840 --> 26:05.840]  just everything we expected I said watch there be military psychiatrists
[26:05.840 --> 26:08.840]  it's always the same
[26:08.840 --> 26:14.840]  this guy now is was in army psyops for six years
[26:14.840 --> 26:18.840]  clearly sheep dipped that's exactly who they take out of the military
[26:18.840 --> 26:23.840]  they're not really out put in deep cover inside white supremacist groups
[26:23.840 --> 26:30.840]  just like Tim McVeigh at Elohim City run by the Southern Poverty Law Center
[26:30.840 --> 26:35.840]  Jesse Trinadu's brother was tortured and killed because they thought he had knowledge of it
[26:35.840 --> 26:39.840]  the lawyer sued kept suing kept getting for a request blacked out
[26:39.840 --> 26:43.840]  but they blacked out one part of a document once he sued through another court
[26:43.840 --> 26:46.840]  got the same document with another part blacked out put the two together
[26:46.840 --> 26:52.840]  and it was the Southern Poverty Law Center running the entire operation
[26:52.840 --> 26:56.840]  and guess who's all over this as usual
[26:56.840 --> 27:01.840]  turns out the FBI was surveilling this group oh I bet they were
[27:01.840 --> 27:06.840]  and by the way it's a group and did a cop shoot the Patsy and stop him
[27:06.840 --> 27:11.840]  or was this all a setup or was somebody else a plan Patsy
[27:11.840 --> 27:15.840]  it's got all the markers I could go on for 10 hours is the problem
[27:15.840 --> 27:19.840]  she got the White House saying don't worry there's going to be events
[27:19.840 --> 27:22.840]  that we're going to blame on people now they don't say they're going to do it
[27:22.840 --> 27:26.840]  they say there will be mass shootings and bombings and it will help the president connect
[27:26.840 --> 27:30.840]  with the public they even say it on hardball that's how dumb they think you are
[27:30.840 --> 27:34.840]  they say this in front of you because they know they control the dominant media
[27:34.840 --> 27:40.840]  it's still somewhat dominant but not for long and so they can push the narrative out
[27:40.840 --> 27:45.840]  they can push the narrative so I'm sitting here watching them get ready for it
[27:45.840 --> 27:50.840]  okay the bills are being introduced here comes the UN treaty it's going to start right now
[27:50.840 --> 27:53.840]  I had guessed on a month before this happened saying
[27:53.840 --> 27:56.840]  I had the makers of a noble lion saying get ready
[27:56.840 --> 28:01.840]  we all agreed mass shootings at churches
[28:01.840 --> 28:05.840]  malls, movie theaters, sports stadiums
[28:05.840 --> 28:08.840]  everywhere they're going to put the TSA and boom it happened
[28:08.840 --> 28:10.840]  right as the TSA was already rolling out nationwide
[28:10.840 --> 28:13.840]  I mean they're rolling out a week
[28:13.840 --> 28:16.840]  on January 1st they were rolling out in over 100 airports
[28:16.840 --> 28:20.840]  so they staged the underwear bombing put the guy on the plane that all came out in the news
[28:20.840 --> 28:23.840]  and said oh we decided to put these in because of the underwear bombing
[28:23.840 --> 28:27.840]  when they ordered the manufacture 14-15 months before
[28:27.840 --> 28:30.840]  and they were going to be delivered the next week so the bombing happens
[28:30.840 --> 28:35.840]  I mean it's listen it's like US troops massed 44,000 of them
[28:35.840 --> 28:40.840]  with 16 or was it 18,000 British troops in and around Afghanistan
[28:40.840 --> 28:44.840]  in the month before 9-11 and Bush signed the launch order to attack Afghanistan
[28:44.840 --> 28:48.840]  in seven days on September 10th
[28:48.840 --> 28:52.840]  you watch it it'd be like the Poles watching the German military line up
[28:52.840 --> 28:56.840]  the Poles said international communities stop them from attacking us
[28:56.840 --> 29:00.840]  they're lining up to attack boom the Germans attack their own military base
[29:00.840 --> 29:03.840]  and then invade Poland I mean I watch them build up
[29:03.840 --> 29:07.840]  put out the memos get ready introduce the bills stage it
[29:07.840 --> 29:12.840]  and then it's always Army Psyop and Army psychiatrist and Air Force psychiatrist
[29:12.840 --> 29:16.840]  and witnesses seen four shooters the head of the Sikh group
[29:16.840 --> 29:20.840]  said there were men casing the joint the day before police driving off
[29:20.840 --> 29:24.840]  of course they probably ran a drill
[29:24.840 --> 29:28.840]  they've got undercover drills and called the cop and shot the cop
[29:28.840 --> 29:31.840]  and then they probably shot the Patsy in the back of the head
[29:31.840 --> 29:33.840]  if I had to guess that's how they operate
[29:33.840 --> 29:35.840]  you ever seen Mark Wahlberg's movie The Shooter
[29:35.840 --> 29:39.840]  you better go rent that or watch it on Netflix today
[29:39.840 --> 29:42.840]  because that's exactly what they do
[29:42.840 --> 29:45.840]  okay exactly what they do
[29:45.840 --> 29:48.840]  this guy was probably infiltrating white supremacist
[29:48.840 --> 29:52.840]  we're on the march the empires on the run

[33:29.840 --> 33:31.840]  okay, we're going to your phone calls
[33:31.840 --> 33:32.840]  here in just a moment
[33:32.840 --> 33:35.840]  on this live Tuesday worldwide transmission
[33:35.840 --> 33:38.840]  I am your host alex jones
[33:38.840 --> 33:42.840]  the criminal bankers that hijacked our country in 1913
[33:42.840 --> 33:46.840]  have pretty much taken over most of the state governments
[33:46.840 --> 33:48.840]  and now the bureaucracy
[33:48.840 --> 33:51.840]  they had a beachhead in 1913 with the private federal reserve
[33:51.840 --> 33:54.840]  and the income tax they set up
[33:54.840 --> 33:57.840]  and how do they launch wars
[33:57.840 --> 34:02.840]  well they back then because the media moved so slow in 1898
[34:02.840 --> 34:06.840]  they just published and hurst newspapers all over the country
[34:06.840 --> 34:11.840]  that the spanish troops in cuba
[34:11.840 --> 34:14.840]  had attacked us troops and were killing women and children
[34:14.840 --> 34:18.840]  and had blown up the USS main
[34:18.840 --> 34:21.840]  and of course none of that was true it was all made up
[34:21.840 --> 34:24.840]  but it was unpatriotic to say that
[34:24.840 --> 34:28.840]  besides hurst publishing wouldn't engage in a lie that big
[34:28.840 --> 34:32.840]  you see once a big lie is pushed out there
[34:32.840 --> 34:35.840]  and people buy into it
[34:35.840 --> 34:37.840]  then they don't want to admit they've been conned
[34:37.840 --> 34:40.840]  and so many big wigs will go down
[34:40.840 --> 34:44.840]  that once the power structure who isn't even really involved
[34:44.840 --> 34:46.840]  in the crime goes along with the story
[34:46.840 --> 34:48.840]  they now become complicit
[34:48.840 --> 34:52.840]  and so now you can get them involved in anything you want
[34:52.840 --> 34:55.840]  after that point that's how you corrupt someone
[34:55.840 --> 34:58.840]  or how you corrupt a society
[34:58.840 --> 35:01.840]  and so cold-bloodedly we have a government
[35:01.840 --> 35:03.840]  and then I'm going to go to your calls
[35:03.840 --> 35:09.840]  who has been caught this current administration
[35:09.840 --> 35:11.840]  shipping tens of thousands of guns
[35:11.840 --> 35:14.840]  and even hand grenades rocket launchers you name it
[35:14.840 --> 35:17.840]  to Mexico to destabilize the country
[35:17.840 --> 35:19.840]  and to blame the second amendment
[35:19.840 --> 35:22.840]  and all the memos came out that that was their plan
[35:22.840 --> 35:26.840]  and congress is so blackmailed
[35:26.840 --> 35:28.840]  they're acting like they're going after them
[35:28.840 --> 35:32.840]  but really aren't
[35:32.840 --> 35:34.840]  and so the very same crew that ran Fast and Furious
[35:34.840 --> 35:37.840]  the very same names
[35:37.840 --> 35:41.840]  are now in command and ran Fast and Furious
[35:41.840 --> 35:45.840]  the very same names were involved in Oklahoma City
[35:45.840 --> 35:47.840]  and by the way I didn't just start saying this
[35:47.840 --> 35:48.840]  under Fast and Furious
[35:48.840 --> 35:51.840]  I made a film ten years ago called Road to Terrority
[35:51.840 --> 35:55.840]  naming names and showing documents of who did Oklahoma City
[35:55.840 --> 35:57.840]  risking my life
[35:57.840 --> 35:59.840]  I've interviewed the police officers
[35:59.840 --> 36:01.840]  I've interviewed the former head of Air Force Weapons Development
[36:01.840 --> 36:05.840]  I've interviewed the workers in the building
[36:05.840 --> 36:10.840]  who saw the government agents and named them later
[36:10.840 --> 36:14.840]  planting the bombs that they thought were yellow sticks of butter
[36:14.840 --> 36:16.840]  or gray sticks of butter
[36:16.840 --> 36:19.840]  and they wondered why telephone repairmen
[36:19.840 --> 36:23.840]  would be doing that and stringing wires
[36:23.840 --> 36:26.840]  so if you've got a group that did that
[36:26.840 --> 36:30.840]  and picked the building because it had a daycare center in it
[36:30.840 --> 36:33.840]  and gee they write public memos saying a terror attack
[36:33.840 --> 36:36.840]  to be blamed on their enemies is how they're going to get re-elected
[36:36.840 --> 36:40.840]  and Bill Clinton said on Air Force One to entire media
[36:40.840 --> 36:45.840]  in 96 the oath is re-election to the Oklahoma City bombing
[36:45.840 --> 36:49.840]  they don't even veil this stuff
[36:52.840 --> 36:55.840]  this is how they get unpopular things through
[36:55.840 --> 36:58.840]  this is how they get control of population
[36:58.840 --> 37:01.840]  and they've been quietly getting ready to shift over
[37:01.840 --> 37:06.840]  from saying that it's foreign Muslims that are the terrorists
[37:06.840 --> 37:08.840]  and that's what we've got to give our rights up
[37:08.840 --> 37:11.840]  shifting now over to domestic groups
[37:11.840 --> 37:13.840]  and who do they say are the terrorists?
[37:13.840 --> 37:16.840]  gun owners, libertarians, conservatives, returning veterans
[37:16.840 --> 37:18.840]  retired police officers
[37:18.840 --> 37:22.840]  Homeland security that is this banker occupation takeover
[37:22.840 --> 37:26.840]  is saying all the veterans are bad because they have profiled them
[37:26.840 --> 37:29.840]  and know that down the road when stuff gets really bad
[37:29.840 --> 37:32.840]  and they try to implement the re-education camps
[37:32.840 --> 37:35.840]  and the gun confiscation that it's going to be veterans
[37:35.840 --> 37:38.840]  that are going to be the group that resists
[37:38.840 --> 37:41.840]  Americans who have used force before
[37:41.840 --> 37:44.840]  who don't mind dying and who are sick and tired of it
[37:44.840 --> 37:48.840]  they've profiled they know it's not that big of a deal to kill somebody
[37:48.840 --> 37:51.840]  they know it's not taboo for you anymore
[37:51.840 --> 37:54.840]  their soldiers themselves a lot of the globalists
[37:54.840 --> 37:56.840]  they just like to kill people
[37:56.840 --> 37:58.840]  you don't like to kill people you're just willing to do it
[37:58.840 --> 38:01.840]  to protect your family they hate you
[38:01.840 --> 38:03.840]  they know you're willing to fight them
[38:03.840 --> 38:06.840]  so they're massing drones and robots
[38:06.840 --> 38:10.840]  and automated weapon systems and high tech against you
[38:10.840 --> 38:13.840]  while recruiting a slovenly group of TSA
[38:13.840 --> 38:15.840]  to be their potbellied commanders
[38:15.840 --> 38:17.840]  just like Hitler did with the brown shirts
[38:17.840 --> 38:21.840]  on the ground to bully the military and others into submission
[38:21.840 --> 38:24.840]  then when they finally take it over the military and police
[38:24.840 --> 38:27.840]  they're going to let you kill the brown shirts
[38:27.840 --> 38:29.840]  this has all been figured out
[38:29.840 --> 38:31.840]  this has all been done over and over again
[38:31.840 --> 38:34.840]  they'll use the brown shirts to take over
[38:34.840 --> 38:36.840]  to get rid of the old guard
[38:36.840 --> 38:39.840]  then they'll let the new military guard who's disgusted
[38:39.840 --> 38:41.840]  by the potbellied rulers
[38:41.840 --> 38:43.840]  you'll be able to take them out
[38:43.840 --> 38:45.840]  see it's all been figured out and I don't want to get off into
[38:45.840 --> 38:47.840]  too sophisticated areas
[38:47.840 --> 38:49.840]  the point is
[38:49.840 --> 38:54.840]  tyrants follow very specific playbooks
[38:54.840 --> 38:56.840]  and the timing
[38:56.840 --> 38:58.840]  the army shy off
[38:58.840 --> 39:00.840]  the witnesses saying they were being caged
[39:00.840 --> 39:02.840]  multiple witnesses saying four shooters
[39:02.840 --> 39:08.840]  all of this fits together
[39:08.840 --> 39:10.840]  just like Oklahoma City
[39:10.840 --> 39:13.840]  you've got a high level army officer
[39:13.840 --> 39:15.840]  at a high level of national security
[39:15.840 --> 39:17.840]  which means bankers security
[39:17.840 --> 39:19.840]  a white supremacist nest
[39:19.840 --> 39:21.840]  over the last decade
[39:21.840 --> 39:23.840]  most of the members are FBI agents
[39:23.840 --> 39:25.840]  or informants
[39:25.840 --> 39:27.840]  trying to target weak minds
[39:27.840 --> 39:29.840]  that they can provocateur and do an attack
[39:29.840 --> 39:31.840]  and if you can't do that
[39:31.840 --> 39:34.840]  you go and say you're going to have a sting
[39:34.840 --> 39:36.840]  at a temple
[39:36.840 --> 39:38.840]  you wind somebody up
[39:38.840 --> 39:40.840]  to finally go in and
[39:40.840 --> 39:42.840]  shoot a bunch of people
[39:42.840 --> 39:44.840]  or you have special ops
[39:44.840 --> 39:47.840]  generally from a foreign country or mercenaries
[39:47.840 --> 39:49.840]  do it and you kill the patsy on the spot
[39:49.840 --> 39:51.840]  who typecast into the area you want
[39:51.840 --> 39:53.840]  and I don't know which one it is
[39:53.840 --> 39:55.840]  but within the quadrants
[39:55.840 --> 39:56.840]  it's right there
[39:56.840 --> 39:58.840]  it's exactly what I would expect
[39:58.840 --> 40:00.840]  it's exactly what I predicted
[40:00.840 --> 40:02.840]  over and over again you've heard me here
[40:02.840 --> 40:04.840]  so I said I'd go to your phone calls
[40:04.840 --> 40:05.840]  we'll go to them now
[40:05.840 --> 40:07.840]  I'm sure it'll be all over the map but that's okay
[40:10.840 --> 40:12.840]  India is seeking more security
[40:12.840 --> 40:14.840]  than what Hindu is reporting
[40:14.840 --> 40:16.840]  for their religious places in the US
[40:16.840 --> 40:18.840]  the idea that police are going to protect you
[40:18.840 --> 40:20.840]  or can protect you
[40:20.840 --> 40:22.840]  the answer is you should have
[40:22.840 --> 40:24.840]  armed security
[40:24.840 --> 40:26.840]  you should pick deacons who are trusted
[40:26.840 --> 40:28.840]  members of your congregation
[40:28.840 --> 40:30.840]  whether you're a synagogue, a mosque, a church
[40:30.840 --> 40:32.840]  a Sikh church
[40:32.840 --> 40:34.840]  there with their Sunday school
[40:34.840 --> 40:36.840]  more akin to Christianity
[40:36.840 --> 40:38.840]  than Hinduism
[40:38.840 --> 40:40.840]  or Buddhism
[40:40.840 --> 40:42.840]  and I said Sunday
[40:42.840 --> 40:44.840]  I said it could be a lone nut
[40:44.840 --> 40:46.840]  who sees guys with bright turbans
[40:46.840 --> 40:48.840]  and thinks it's been lauding in a sicka
[40:48.840 --> 40:50.840]  looking at it and gets mad at his wife
[40:50.840 --> 40:52.840]  and his destitute
[40:52.840 --> 40:54.840]  and wants to commit suicide by cop
[40:54.840 --> 40:56.840]  so he goes over and shoots some people
[40:56.840 --> 40:58.840]  at a Sikh temple
[40:58.840 --> 41:00.840]  that was a possibility Sunday
[41:00.840 --> 41:02.840]  and we said that could be what it was
[41:02.840 --> 41:04.840]  but my gut because of the timing
[41:04.840 --> 41:06.840]  and the reports of four shooters
[41:06.840 --> 41:08.840]  didn't say that
[41:08.840 --> 41:10.840]  then the PSIA officer stuff
[41:10.840 --> 41:12.840]  came out and
[41:12.840 --> 41:14.840]  the police recordings and all the rest of it
[41:14.840 --> 41:16.840]  and the timing and the hyping of it
[41:16.840 --> 41:18.840]  here's my final point and I'm going to your calls
[41:18.840 --> 41:20.840]  you better look up
[41:20.840 --> 41:22.840]  Operation Gladio
[41:22.840 --> 41:24.840]  much of it's been declassified
[41:24.840 --> 41:26.840]  mass shootings and bombings of movie theaters
[41:26.840 --> 41:28.840]  school buses, train stations
[41:28.840 --> 41:30.840]  you name it all over Europe
[41:30.840 --> 41:32.840]  it's all come out in Italian government
[41:32.840 --> 41:34.840]  their own president went public
[41:34.840 --> 41:36.840]  Operation Gladio was staged
[41:36.840 --> 41:38.840]  a second amendment
[41:38.840 --> 41:40.840]  period
[41:40.840 --> 41:42.840]  Operation Gladio
[41:42.840 --> 41:44.840]  was staged to blame
[41:44.840 --> 41:46.840]  their
[41:46.840 --> 41:48.840]  second amendment style systems of liberty
[41:48.840 --> 41:50.840]  and freedom over there was used to disarm them
[41:50.840 --> 41:52.840]  and it was used
[41:52.840 --> 41:54.840]  to go after
[41:54.840 --> 41:56.840]  any political party they didn't like
[41:56.840 --> 41:58.840]  whether it be right wing or left wing
[41:58.840 --> 42:00.840]  that was anti-globalist and wasn't playing ball
[42:00.840 --> 42:02.840]  we sell a book called Gladio, NATO's Dagger
[42:02.840 --> 42:04.840]  at the heart of Europe
[42:04.840 --> 42:06.840]  that's how you nudge people in doing what you want
[42:08.840 --> 42:10.840]  and you better look into it
[42:10.840 --> 42:12.840]  you better find out because Operation Gladio
[42:12.840 --> 42:14.840]  part two is being implemented
[42:14.840 --> 42:16.840]  inside the United States
[42:20.840 --> 42:22.840]  it started at the end of World War II
[42:22.840 --> 42:24.840]  the NATO put in countries
[42:24.840 --> 42:26.840]  they thought were going to be overrun by the Soviets
[42:26.840 --> 42:28.840]  the bankers knew they were
[42:28.840 --> 42:30.840]  they were funding the Soviets as a class of civilizations
[42:30.840 --> 42:32.840]  to be able to be sleeper
[42:32.840 --> 42:34.840]  cells to engage in sabotage
[42:34.840 --> 42:36.840]  they were really used to stage terror attacks
[42:36.840 --> 42:38.840]  to blame their enemies
[42:38.840 --> 42:40.840]  because frame-ups
[42:40.840 --> 42:42.840]  are the number one way
[42:42.840 --> 42:44.840]  to be able to go after your enemies
[42:44.840 --> 42:46.840]  it's very simple
[42:46.840 --> 42:48.840]  no amount of regular propaganda can be
[42:48.840 --> 42:50.840]  as effective as staging a shooting
[42:50.840 --> 42:52.840]  or bombing and blaming your enemy
[42:52.840 --> 42:54.840]  you drug up the Patsy or you kill them on the spot
[42:54.840 --> 42:56.840]  these are all the telltale signs
[42:56.840 --> 42:58.840]  alright I'm done ranting
[42:58.840 --> 43:00.840]  we'll go to your calls till eight after
[43:00.840 --> 43:02.840]  you're joining us
[43:02.840 --> 43:04.840]  Eli in Virginia thanks for holding
[43:04.840 --> 43:06.840]  you're on the air on this Tuesday Transmission
[43:06.840 --> 43:08.840]  go ahead
[43:08.840 --> 43:10.840]  I just wanted to
[43:10.840 --> 43:12.840]  say I agree with you 100%
[43:12.840 --> 43:14.840]  this is clearly an inside job
[43:14.840 --> 43:16.840]  I'm actually a former police officer
[43:16.840 --> 43:18.840]  I'm 24
[43:18.840 --> 43:20.840]  I work for the Commonwealth of Virginia
[43:20.840 --> 43:22.840]  as a police officer
[43:22.840 --> 43:24.840]  and I've been in the meeting
[43:24.840 --> 43:26.840]  where they say
[43:26.840 --> 43:28.840]  domestic terrorists
[43:28.840 --> 43:30.840]  or question an officer's authority
[43:30.840 --> 43:32.840]  under the Constitution
[43:32.840 --> 43:34.840]  or vote for Ron Paul
[43:34.840 --> 43:36.840]  I've been in those briefings
[43:36.840 --> 43:38.840]  and I got out of the career
[43:38.840 --> 43:40.840]  and trying to make it on my own
[43:40.840 --> 43:42.840]  I'll support my family but I'm with you
[43:42.840 --> 43:44.840]  100% Eli
[43:44.840 --> 43:46.840]  I mean this is so clearly
[43:46.840 --> 43:48.840]  what's going on frustrates me so much
[43:48.840 --> 43:50.840]  as you see people responding
[43:50.840 --> 43:52.840]  exactly the way the government wants
[43:52.840 --> 43:54.840]  they say I've been reading on the comments
[43:54.840 --> 43:56.840]  on the news articles about the shooting
[43:56.840 --> 43:58.840]  oh yeah this is we spent billions
[43:58.840 --> 44:00.840]  overseas trying to stop terrorism
[44:00.840 --> 44:02.840]  but what about domestic terrorism
[44:02.840 --> 44:04.840]  we need to give gun control a good look
[44:04.840 --> 44:06.840]  we need to stop these domestic terrorists
[44:06.840 --> 44:08.840]  I can tell you what the cops think
[44:08.840 --> 44:10.840]  domestic terrorism is
[44:10.840 --> 44:12.840]  they think it's white supremacists, Nazi groups
[44:12.840 --> 44:14.840]  Christians and Ron Paul voters
[44:14.840 --> 44:16.840]  that's what the police officers think
[44:16.840 --> 44:18.840]  well that's what they're certainly trying to teach
[44:18.840 --> 44:20.840]  him it's actually backfired as a lot of police
[44:20.840 --> 44:22.840]  have looked into
[44:22.840 --> 44:24.840]  who they're being told the terrorist are
[44:24.840 --> 44:26.840]  but look the foreign banks
[44:26.840 --> 44:28.840]  have openly announced they've conquered the US
[44:28.840 --> 44:30.840]  and now they want to go after the opposition
[44:30.840 --> 44:32.840]  that understands what's happening
[44:32.840 --> 44:34.840]  but were the other police officers
[44:34.840 --> 44:36.840]  where you were in Virginia
[44:36.840 --> 44:38.840]  were they buying this because I mean
[44:38.840 --> 44:40.840]  I don't just have to believe you I have the training manuals
[44:40.840 --> 44:42.840]  of your new listener out there folks
[44:42.840 --> 44:44.840]  we have the training videos where they say
[44:44.840 --> 44:46.840]  the founding fathers are bad
[44:46.840 --> 44:48.840]  freedom is bad
[44:48.840 --> 44:50.840]  conservatives are bad
[44:50.840 --> 44:52.840]  returning veterans of the terrorist
[44:52.840 --> 44:54.840]  and
[44:54.840 --> 44:56.840]  so Homeland Security keeps saying
[44:56.840 --> 44:58.840]  this is about to happen
[44:58.840 --> 45:00.840]  the new enemy is the American people
[45:00.840 --> 45:02.840]  this is how they flip the script on us
[45:02.840 --> 45:04.840]  I mean how many of the police officers
[45:04.840 --> 45:06.840]  that you were around bought into this brainwashing
[45:06.840 --> 45:08.840]  actually
[45:08.840 --> 45:10.840]  quite a lot
[45:10.840 --> 45:12.840]  I mean it's what's being pushed you know Homeland Security
[45:12.840 --> 45:14.840]  I mean when you got FEMA and your fusion centers
[45:14.840 --> 45:16.840]  telling you this stuff
[45:16.840 --> 45:18.840]  and it's you know intel
[45:18.840 --> 45:20.840]  and law enforcement sensitive only
[45:20.840 --> 45:22.840]  and a club you know it's like
[45:22.840 --> 45:24.840]  a secret group
[45:24.840 --> 45:26.840]  exactly it's like little it's like
[45:26.840 --> 45:28.840]  seven year olds being invited up by the
[45:28.840 --> 45:30.840]  ten year olds into the clubhouse
[45:30.840 --> 45:32.840]  just so they can have you you know do
[45:32.840 --> 45:34.840]  stupid stuff
[45:34.840 --> 45:36.840]  that's all this is and none of it's
[45:36.840 --> 45:38.840]  real intel it's all this regurgitated
[45:38.840 --> 45:40.840]  Southern Parvy Law Center
[45:40.840 --> 45:42.840]  ADL
[45:42.840 --> 45:44.840]  ADL is basically Mossad propaganda
[45:44.840 --> 45:46.840]  that is fed to the police
[45:46.840 --> 45:48.840]  it is so pathetic
[45:48.840 --> 45:50.840]  and it just keeps the all the all the populace
[45:50.840 --> 45:52.840]  just live in their normalcy bias and Stockholm syndrome
[45:52.840 --> 45:54.840]  just happy to have the government
[45:54.840 --> 45:56.840]  caring for them but there's one more thing
[45:56.840 --> 45:58.840]  Alex and I'll get off I know you're a busy man
[45:58.840 --> 46:00.840]  I know you said that you need somebody
[46:00.840 --> 46:02.840]  in Virginia as a reporter
[46:02.840 --> 46:04.840]  I'm right outside of DC
[46:04.840 --> 46:06.840]  and I know you probably get everybody telling you this
[46:06.840 --> 46:08.840]  but it would be an honor and a privilege to work for you
[46:08.840 --> 46:10.840]  I've got a paralegal certification
[46:10.840 --> 46:12.840]  I quit my job in a heartbeat
[46:12.840 --> 46:14.840]  to work for you would be a great honor
[46:14.840 --> 46:16.840]  so I just thought I'd throw that out there
[46:16.840 --> 46:18.840]  that's my problem
[46:18.840 --> 46:20.840]  A it's getting money to hire people
[46:20.840 --> 46:22.840]  B it's then managing them
[46:22.840 --> 46:24.840]  I've got a great crew the problem is
[46:24.840 --> 46:26.840]  I have to tell people and train them
[46:26.840 --> 46:28.840]  and it's all a time issue
[46:28.840 --> 46:30.840]  I almost don't want to do my show for like a month
[46:30.840 --> 46:32.840]  and just try to get everything set up
[46:32.840 --> 46:34.840]  the way I want it set up around here
[46:34.840 --> 46:36.840]  because it's the frustration of always having to do 10 things
[46:36.840 --> 46:38.840]  but
[46:38.840 --> 46:40.840]  we are in the arena so that's what it's all about
[46:40.840 --> 46:42.840]  but God bless you I appreciate your call
[46:42.840 --> 46:44.840]  send us your information
[46:44.840 --> 46:46.840]  to our reporters slash video editors
[46:46.840 --> 46:48.840]  in-house
[46:48.840 --> 46:50.840]  and then we do want to get next phase correspondence out there
[46:52.840 --> 46:54.840]  and I would just suggest you start doing your own
[46:54.840 --> 46:56.840]  YouTube channel search or doing your own reports
[46:56.840 --> 46:58.840]  and then that's how you
[46:58.840 --> 47:00.840]  ended up getting hired somewhere
[47:00.840 --> 47:02.840]  let's go ahead and talk to Michael in Oklahoma
[47:02.840 --> 47:04.840]  Michael you're on the air go ahead
[47:04.840 --> 47:06.840]  Michael
[47:06.840 --> 47:08.840]  Alex thanks for taking my call
[47:08.840 --> 47:10.840]  I got something so important to tell you about
[47:10.840 --> 47:12.840]  Prozac, James Holmes and Mind Control
[47:12.840 --> 47:14.840]  and this may go back all the way to the
[47:14.840 --> 47:16.840]  MKUltra experiment
[47:16.840 --> 47:18.840]  I have four friends the other day who experimented
[47:18.840 --> 47:20.840]  with LSD
[47:20.840 --> 47:22.840]  and they all after about the six hour mark
[47:22.840 --> 47:24.840]  started coming down off it
[47:24.840 --> 47:26.840]  except one girl she kept getting higher
[47:26.840 --> 47:28.840]  and higher and higher
[47:28.840 --> 47:30.840]  and the one difference between her and all the other people is
[47:30.840 --> 47:32.840]  she has a prescription for Prozac
[47:32.840 --> 47:34.840]  and she takes Prozac on a regular basis
[47:34.840 --> 47:36.840]  and she got so high she lost her mind
[47:36.840 --> 47:38.840]  and she started attacking people
[47:38.840 --> 47:40.840]  she started trying to bite our friends
[47:40.840 --> 47:42.840]  she tore the house apart
[47:42.840 --> 47:44.840]  I mean she got so crazy
[47:44.840 --> 47:46.840]  that's what they did in Mind Control
[47:46.840 --> 47:48.840]  is they do electro shock
[47:48.840 --> 47:50.840]  to totally confuse you
[47:50.840 --> 47:52.840]  then they give you LSD, PCP
[47:52.840 --> 47:54.840]  and other drugs
[47:54.840 --> 47:56.840]  at the same time horse tranquilizers
[47:56.840 --> 47:58.840]  so that
[47:58.840 --> 48:00.840]  all that's operating is your lower animal
[48:00.840 --> 48:02.840]  centers of your brain
[48:02.840 --> 48:04.840]  and of course everybody you see doing these
[48:04.840 --> 48:06.840]  zombie attacks is on four or five
[48:06.840 --> 48:08.840]  drugs mixed together
[48:08.840 --> 48:10.840]  and yes, sure, the moon biotechs
[48:10.840 --> 48:12.840]  the CIA and India
[48:12.840 --> 48:14.840]  this even came out in the news at the time
[48:14.840 --> 48:16.840]  I said they were clearly from the video on drugs
[48:16.840 --> 48:18.840]  totally wild eyed
[48:18.840 --> 48:20.840]  they were on injectable
[48:20.840 --> 48:22.840]  LSD and PCP and quote other drugs
[48:22.840 --> 48:24.840]  that were synthetic and the Indians
[48:24.840 --> 48:26.840]  couldn't figure out what they were
[48:26.840 --> 48:28.840]  they said they were some new designer drug
[48:28.840 --> 48:30.840]  they landed those guys they'd probably been drugged
[48:30.840 --> 48:32.840]  up for six months in hospital beds
[48:32.840 --> 48:34.840]  you know with video games
[48:34.840 --> 48:36.840]  pumping in shooter scenarios
[48:36.840 --> 48:38.840]  one way they do mind control
[48:38.840 --> 48:40.840]  and then they just turn them loose
[48:40.840 --> 48:42.840]  the boats land, you release them
[48:42.840 --> 48:44.840]  and it's party time
[48:44.840 --> 48:46.840]  I'm sorry go ahead
[48:46.840 --> 48:48.840]  and you won't believe this and she got so crazy
[48:48.840 --> 48:50.840]  that she was biting and going
[48:50.840 --> 48:52.840]  she was so afraid that his lady was going to hurt herself
[48:52.840 --> 48:54.840]  he called 911
[48:54.840 --> 48:56.840]  and anybody tripping on LSD does not
[48:56.840 --> 48:58.840]  want to call the police
[48:58.840 --> 49:00.840]  well of course they show up, they arrest everybody
[49:00.840 --> 49:02.840]  and she has to stay the night in the hospital
[49:02.840 --> 49:04.840]  and it wasn't until the next day before she finally
[49:04.840 --> 49:06.840]  came down she had no recollection
[49:06.840 --> 49:08.840]  whatsoever of that happening
[49:08.840 --> 49:10.840]  at all
[49:10.840 --> 49:12.840]  sir if you take Xanax with alcohol it can do that
[49:12.840 --> 49:14.840]  the guy a few months ago that shot a cop
[49:14.840 --> 49:16.840]  for no reason in Walmart
[49:16.840 --> 49:18.840]  his roommate said he would take huge dosages
[49:18.840 --> 49:20.840]  of Xanax and drink
[49:20.840 --> 49:22.840]  I've talked to friends
[49:22.840 --> 49:24.840]  who you know they're in a car wreck so they give them some Xanax
[49:24.840 --> 49:26.840]  for depression and they drink two beers
[49:26.840 --> 49:28.840]  and don't know who they are
[49:28.840 --> 49:30.840]  and wake up eight hours later in another town
[49:30.840 --> 49:32.840]  drooling in a parking lot
[49:32.840 --> 49:34.840]  I mean look they've got all these
[49:34.840 --> 49:36.840]  wild drugs that are giving us
[49:36.840 --> 49:38.840]  you're going to see this happen
[49:38.840 --> 49:40.840]  but imagine what government can do with those drugs
[49:40.840 --> 49:42.840]  and mind control
[49:42.840 --> 49:44.840]  you add electroshock to it
[49:44.840 --> 49:46.840]  and then they put these audio sensors on them
[49:46.840 --> 49:48.840]  and just pump audio and visual in
[49:48.840 --> 49:50.840]  you show somebody
[49:50.840 --> 49:52.840]  over six months
[49:52.840 --> 49:54.840]  over 20 or 30
[49:54.840 --> 49:56.840]  week long drug trips
[49:56.840 --> 49:58.840]  you put somebody
[49:58.840 --> 50:00.840]  on that stuff that long
[50:00.840 --> 50:02.840]  totally erase who they are
[50:02.840 --> 50:04.840]  and then put a gun in their hand the rest is history
[50:06.840 --> 50:08.840]  that just totally reminded me
[50:08.840 --> 50:10.840]  as soon as I was listening to your weekly night
[50:10.840 --> 50:12.840]  we know it's a new show just the other night
[50:12.840 --> 50:14.840]  and when you were talking about Prozac
[50:14.840 --> 50:16.840]  and James Holmes was prescribed Prozac
[50:16.840 --> 50:18.840]  and now he has no memory of the accident
[50:18.840 --> 50:20.840]  whatsoever
[50:20.840 --> 50:22.840]  that just totally reminded me of that
[50:22.840 --> 50:24.840]  because all of them had a great time
[50:24.840 --> 50:26.840]  and it was totally fine
[50:26.840 --> 50:28.840]  but she was the only one that kept getting higher
[50:28.840 --> 50:30.840]  and higher and that she quite quick
[50:30.840 --> 50:32.840]  she had a chemical imbalance
[50:32.840 --> 50:34.840]  look here's the deal
[50:34.840 --> 50:36.840]  LSD gives you a chemical imbalance
[50:36.840 --> 50:38.840]  but you add things in there
[50:38.840 --> 50:40.840]  like a serotonin reuptake inhibitor
[50:40.840 --> 50:42.840]  her brain just kept absorbing
[50:42.840 --> 50:44.840]  and absorbing and absorbing the LSD
[50:44.840 --> 50:46.840]  until she probably
[50:46.840 --> 50:48.840]  took the equivalent of 20 tabs
[50:48.840 --> 50:50.840]  of it or more
[50:50.840 --> 50:52.840]  and that's when people jump off buildings
[50:52.840 --> 50:54.840]  that's when people eat their baby
[50:54.840 --> 50:56.840]  Prozac
[50:56.840 --> 50:58.840]  she is a hallucinogen
[50:58.840 --> 51:26.840]  we need the insert

[53:14.840 --> 53:16.840]  in fact the Wall Street Journal reported

[55:14.840 --> 55:16.840]  we're in a lot of trouble
[55:16.840 --> 55:18.840]  the globalists are
[55:18.840 --> 55:20.840]  willing to do anything that they are so brazen
[55:20.840 --> 55:22.840]  even though they've been caught over and over again
[55:22.840 --> 55:24.840]  I mean they got caught doing fast and furious
[55:24.840 --> 55:26.840]  because it was so big
[55:26.840 --> 55:28.840]  and had so many people involved
[55:28.840 --> 55:30.840]  but still the media has only covered a few
[55:30.840 --> 55:32.840]  areas of it wasn't just
[55:32.840 --> 55:34.840]  shipping guns folks it was a lot more than that
[55:34.840 --> 55:36.840]  drugs back into the US
[55:36.840 --> 55:38.840]  weapons to drug gangs around the US
[55:38.840 --> 55:40.840]  the people at the top
[55:40.840 --> 55:42.840]  of law enforcement in this country
[55:42.840 --> 55:44.840]  are narcotics traffickers
[55:44.840 --> 55:46.840]  big pharma that runs
[55:46.840 --> 55:48.840]  this country to a great extent
[55:48.840 --> 55:50.840]  they were all the companies that brought in opium
[55:50.840 --> 55:52.840]  and cocaine before
[55:52.840 --> 55:54.840]  they developed synthetic drugs
[55:54.840 --> 55:56.840]  they made drugs illegal
[55:56.840 --> 55:58.840]  in the last 90 years because they were losing
[55:58.840 --> 56:00.840]  their monopoly of bringing in
[56:00.840 --> 56:02.840]  legally so they just
[56:02.840 --> 56:04.840]  made it illegal so that they could
[56:04.840 --> 56:06.840]  bring in and make even more money in the black market
[56:06.840 --> 56:08.840]  that's what's really going on here
[56:08.840 --> 56:10.840]  this is a criminal takeover
[56:10.840 --> 56:12.840]  that's what the new world order is
[56:12.840 --> 56:14.840]  and make no mistake
[56:14.840 --> 56:16.840]  I'm not proud of this I'm not saying
[56:16.840 --> 56:18.840]  oh you should praise me for it
[56:18.840 --> 56:20.840]  I'm risking my life though to bring you this information
[56:23.840 --> 56:25.840]  because I understand there's no future
[56:25.840 --> 56:27.840]  if we don't beat these people
[56:27.840 --> 56:29.840]  let's go to Steve in Florida then Mike, Ron and other
[56:29.840 --> 56:31.840]  Steve you're on the air
[56:31.840 --> 56:33.840]  yeah hey Alex
[56:33.840 --> 56:35.840]  a few weeks ago you were
[56:35.840 --> 56:37.840]  interviewing David Ike
[56:37.840 --> 56:39.840]  and as you were interviewing him I was just
[56:39.840 --> 56:41.840]  feeling some brainstorming and thinking about
[56:41.840 --> 56:43.840]  the globalist and how they operate
[56:43.840 --> 56:45.840]  and the average American
[56:45.840 --> 56:47.840]  is basically clueless
[56:47.840 --> 56:49.840]  that these people are masters
[56:49.840 --> 56:51.840]  of deception and manipulation
[56:51.840 --> 56:53.840]  they study
[56:53.840 --> 56:55.840]  humanity so they can
[56:55.840 --> 56:57.840]  get them to do what they want without them
[56:57.840 --> 56:59.840]  even knowing it and go along
[56:59.840 --> 57:01.840]  with what they want until it's too late
[57:01.840 --> 57:03.840]  and then they spring the trap on them
[57:03.840 --> 57:05.840]  and so I just
[57:05.840 --> 57:07.840]  had some thoughts I wanted to share
[57:07.840 --> 57:09.840]  some insight into per psyche
[57:09.840 --> 57:11.840]  these people believe they are
[57:11.840 --> 57:13.840]  superior to everyone in several ways
[57:13.840 --> 57:15.840]  first of all intellectually
[57:15.840 --> 57:17.840]  they engage in psychological manipulation
[57:17.840 --> 57:19.840]  through the corporate media
[57:19.840 --> 57:21.840]  they are disgusted
[57:21.840 --> 57:23.840]  having to look at their fellow
[57:23.840 --> 57:25.840]  humans and want us dead
[57:25.840 --> 57:27.840]  and in all their writings that's what they say
[57:27.840 --> 57:29.840]  yes fake images
[57:29.840 --> 57:31.840]  and deceptive messages
[57:31.840 --> 57:33.840]  they believe they're superior emotionally
[57:33.840 --> 57:35.840]  they engage in emotional agitation
[57:35.840 --> 57:37.840]  through fear tactics
[57:37.840 --> 57:39.840]  intimidation playing on
[57:39.840 --> 57:41.840]  people's passions lust and
[57:41.840 --> 57:43.840]  sentiment and physically
[57:43.840 --> 57:45.840]  they believe they're superior
[57:45.840 --> 57:47.840]  they engage in psychological
[57:47.840 --> 57:49.840]  or physiological deterioration
[57:49.840 --> 57:51.840]  through the toxins they put
[57:51.840 --> 57:53.840]  in the food, water, air etc
[57:53.840 --> 57:55.840]  and they add to the stress
[57:55.840 --> 57:57.840]  of an already high pressure society
[57:57.840 --> 57:59.840]  they believe they are superior
[57:59.840 --> 58:01.840]  economically so they engage
[58:01.840 --> 58:03.840]  in financial degradation
[58:03.840 --> 58:05.840]  through theft, currency, devaluation
[58:05.840 --> 58:07.840]  credit, inflation and taxation
[58:07.840 --> 58:09.840]  politically they engage
[58:09.840 --> 58:11.840]  in tyrannical subjugation
[58:11.840 --> 58:13.840]  to military force
[58:13.840 --> 58:15.840]  unnecessary police brutality
[58:15.840 --> 58:17.840]  unjust imprisonment
[58:17.840 --> 58:19.840]  unconstitutional laws and proceedings
[58:19.840 --> 58:21.840]  and unsuitable corrupt leadership
[58:21.840 --> 58:23.840]  and then finally they believe
[58:23.840 --> 58:25.840]  they are superior spiritually
[58:25.840 --> 58:27.840]  so they engage in ecclesiastical domination
[58:27.840 --> 58:29.840]  through their false doctrine and teachings
[58:29.840 --> 58:31.840]  their all called practices
[58:31.840 --> 58:33.840]  their counterfeit churches
[58:33.840 --> 58:35.840]  listen I agree with you but I gotta go
[58:35.840 --> 58:41.840]  you should shoot a youtube video with that

[01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:03.840]  hey Alex it's great to talk to a fellow patriot
[01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:05.840]  good to talk to you
[01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:07.840]  brother
[01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:09.840]  so I um
[01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:11.840]  I've been listening to you for a while
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:13.840]  and you uh you've been saying
[01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:15.840]  that you've been putting your life on the line
[01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:19.840]  and I believe it and uh I wanted to take the step and uh
[01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:21.840]  you know do the same
[01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:23.840]  and uh I come to you today
[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:25.840]  with an idea that I think will
[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:27.840]  bind all of us info warriors together
[01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:31.840]  and launch a cataclysmic attack on the globalist
[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:33.840]  agenda
[01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:35.840]  and uh do that
[01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:37.840]  I think that if we
[01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:39.840]  were to take some of the money from the info uh
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:41.840]  the info bomb this year
[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:43.840]  the money bomb this year
[01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:45.840]  and uh put that towards producing
[01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:47.840]  some advertisements
[01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:49.840]  either in um video
[01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:51.840]  or audio or both
[01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:53.840]  on your respective stations that you broadcast on
[01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:55.840]  and uh
[01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:57.840]  target the sheeple
[01:01:57.840 --> 01:01:59.840]  if you will
[01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:01.840]  to notify them and inform them
[01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:03.840]  of what's really going on
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:05.840]  and I think honestly
[01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:07.840]  that uh if you were to do this
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:09.840]  we would all be happy to give you the money
[01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:11.840]  to do this to make it happen
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:13.840]  um I know I'm broke as it comes but uh
[01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:15.840]  well I don't listen listen here's the deal
[01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:17.840]  we reached tens of millions of people
[01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:19.840]  but money-wise
[01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:21.840]  I did the national ad
[01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:23.840]  for uh Stansbury research
[01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:25.840]  dealing with QE3
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:27.840]  about what's gonna happen when that does finally come out
[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:29.840]  and I don't want to get into their budget
[01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:31.840]  any more than one of our money bombs would raise
[01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:33.840]  I mean a lot more every month
[01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:35.840]  and
[01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:37.840]  you saw it on Fox, CNN, you name it
[01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:39.840]  they didn't want my
[01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:41.840]  voice
[01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:43.840]  on Fox and CNN
[01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:45.840]  and Stansbury had to play Gutsball for about a month
[01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:47.840]  and not run the ads
[01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:49.840]  until they caved in the establishment
[01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:51.840]  is that scared of me
[01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:53.840]  so
[01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:55.840]  uh we've had national radio
[01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:57.840]  when Ted Anderson wanted me
[01:02:57.840 --> 01:02:59.840]  uh his gold company
[01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:01.840]  and running on national ads
[01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:03.840]  national syndicators
[01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:05.840]  refused to run my voice
[01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:07.840]  the system is absolutely
[01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:09.840]  scared to death
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:11.840]  not even saying my name, my voice
[01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:13.840]  uh they don't want out there
[01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:15.840]  for whatever reasons
[01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:17.840]  uh I mean quite frankly
[01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:19.840]  it strikes fear into the globalist when I'm calm
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:21.840]  and not gibbering like a wild monkey
[01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:23.840]  like I usually do
[01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:25.840]  for whatever reason
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:27.840]  I'm not afraid
[01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:29.840]  when I get up here and I say I'm risking my life
[01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:31.840]  these really are killers
[01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:33.840]  but I'm so public
[01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:35.840]  they don't want to kill me probably because it would just
[01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:37.840]  highlight everything I've said and done
[01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:39.840]  it doesn't mean I might not make one I'm angry and they'll have me killed
[01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:41.840]  but I mean I'm willing to have that happen
[01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:43.840]  because these people have got to be defeated
[01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:45.840]  uh I'm trying to build
[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:47.840]  my organization up to a point
[01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:49.840]  where I can just do a hour long news
[01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:51.840]  show and have it on on time
[01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:53.840]  every night to deploy that
[01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:55.840]  um but uh god bless you
[01:03:55.840 --> 01:03:57.840]  and I appreciate your call and your support sir
[01:03:57.840 --> 01:03:59.840]  I again a lot of great
[01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:01.840]  ideas come from listeners
[01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:03.840]  um
[01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:05.840]  I need to be financially
[01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:07.840]  strong enough just to keep the employees I've got
[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:09.840]  and I've got to have some acres buried
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:11.840]  in case we were attacked
[01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:13.840]  or you know had
[01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:15.840]  uh long droughts
[01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:17.840]  of no funds as we go
[01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:19.840]  into this depression um I've
[01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:21.840]  expended much of our backup capital
[01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:23.840]  just to get to the point I'm at right now
[01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:25.840]  so I feel the
[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:27.840]  great urgency and responsibility
[01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:29.840]  to deploy different
[01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:31.840]  programs against the globalist you know we're going to have
[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:33.840]  a franchise
[01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:35.840]  for
[01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:37.840]  info wars newspaper that's going to come out
[01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:39.840]  monthly and that's the best
[01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:41.840]  thing in the free market is to have people that are
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:43.840]  already printers or already have newspapers
[01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:45.840]  to put out one of these
[01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:47.840]  in their area because
[01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:49.840]  uh they're going to try to shut the web down
[01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:51.840]  and as print dies
[01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:53.840]  there'll be a vacuum we can
[01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:55.840]  fill what I call print
[01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:57.840]  2.0 so I have a lot of other
[01:04:57.840 --> 01:04:59.840]  plans
[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:01.840]  the worst drought in 50
[01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:03.840]  years continues and the first six months
[01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:05.840]  of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:07.840]  78% of the Midwest
[01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:09.840]  corn belt is in drought conditions
[01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:11.840]  not only corn but soy alfalfa fruits
[01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:13.840]  vegetables and wheat are all impacted
[01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:15.840]  raising prices the cost to feed
[01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:17.840]  livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers
[01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:19.840]  out of business blowing up your food prices
[01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:21.840]  the only strategy to counter this
[01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:23.840]  is to freeze your food cost to today's prices
[01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:25.840]  by getting your own supply of
[01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:27.840]  foods from e-foods direct now
[01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:29.840]  as the price of raw ingredients increases
[01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:31.840]  e-foods will have to raise prices too
[01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:33.840]  now is the time to get your supply
[01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:35.840]  I recently increased my supply from e-foods direct
[01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:37.840]  because we've all known this was coming
[01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:39.840]  you know about their delicious long term storeable foods
[01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:41.840]  the fact is you can eat it anytime
[01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:43.840]  to save money today and because it stores
[01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:45.840]  for 25 years you're locking in today's prices
[01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:47.840]  and avoiding the rising food cost
[01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:49.840]  don't wait call 800-409-5633

[01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:05.840]  get off the grid and generate your own
[01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:07.840]  supply of electrical power
[01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:09.840]  folks with what's been going on in this country
[01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:11.840]  I don't have to tell you about the power grid
[01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:13.840]  and just how vulnerable it is
[01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:15.840]  there's a lot of extreme news every day
[01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:17.840]  millions of people have lost their power
[01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:19.840]  in the last few weeks because of dangerous storms
[01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:21.840]  and killer heat that's pushing the grid
[01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:23.840]  beyond its capacity
[01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:25.840]  I've always said that every family needs
[01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:27.840]  to be ready for blackouts
[01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:29.840]  and if you don't have a backup system in place
[01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:31.840]  I've got a great opportunity for you
[01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:33.840]  right now our good friends at solutions from science
[01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:35.840]  are offering huge savings
[01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:37.840]  on their best selling power hub unit
[01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:39.840]  in fact I think it's the best deal
[01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:41.840]  I've ever seen them make
[01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:43.840]  literally thousands of dollars in savings
[01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:45.840]  remember these backup systems
[01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:47.840]  don't need gas because they're solar powered
[01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:49.840]  that means there's no dangerous fumes
[01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:51.840]  and no noise
[01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:53.840]  info wars listeners can get all the details

[01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:25.840]  as we wage war on corruption

[01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:47.840]  we're joined by
[01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:49.840]  William N. Gregg
[01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:51.840]  willgregg.com is his website
[01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:53.840]  he writes for the
[01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:55.840]  New American magazine he's produced
[01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:57.840]  quite a few excellent films
[01:08:57.840 --> 01:08:59.840]  but I'm a big fan of the information
[01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:01.840]  he's also an author
[01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:03.840]  he wrote
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:05.840]  America's engineered decline
[01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:07.840]  for the John Birch Society
[01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:09.840]  it's an excellent book I've read it myself
[01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:11.840]  and I wanted to get him on when he talked about
[01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:13.840]  the cowardice of drones
[01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:15.840]  I saw an article he wrote last week
[01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:17.840]  and how it's converting everything over
[01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:19.840]  to these faceless killers
[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:21.840]  and it's pure dehumanization
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:23.840]  people are worried about
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:25.840]  unions taking their jobs or vice versa
[01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:27.840]  and we're all talked to compete with each other
[01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:29.840]  what about
[01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:31.840]  fighters, robots, war making
[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:33.840]  because this is where everything's going
[01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:35.840]  it won't be humans under the sea
[01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:37.840]  they're now admitting for decades
[01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:39.840]  they've had robot
[01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:41.840]  vessels
[01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:43.840]  on the water and under the water
[01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:45.840]  submarines in space
[01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:47.840]  in the air and on the ground
[01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:49.840]  and these can follow the orders of a tiny
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:51.840]  technocratic elite
[01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:53.840]  notice the banksters that have hijacked Europe
[01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:55.840]  through insider crony fraud
[01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:57.840]  and monopoly scams
[01:09:57.840 --> 01:09:59.840]  they call themselves technocrats
[01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:01.840]  so this is the big issue
[01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:03.840]  we'll get to that at the bottom of the hour
[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:05.840]  but I want to cover some other issues
[01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:07.840]  because we started seeking to get Mr. Gregg
[01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:09.840]  on last week
[01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:11.840]  the shooting hadn't happened Sunday
[01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:13.840]  and I noticed for lewrockwell.com
[01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:15.840]  and for his own side he wrote an excellent article
[01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:17.840]  about how the Sikhs
[01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:19.840]  are constantly getting shot, beat up
[01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:21.840]  beat up by police
[01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:23.840]  because people see the bright turban
[01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:25.840]  most Muslims don't actually wear that
[01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:27.840]  they tend to get in a lot of fights with Muslims
[01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:29.840]  over in India
[01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:31.840]  but the point is that it's a different group
[01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:33.840]  completely
[01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:35.840]  but people see the beard
[01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:37.840]  they see the religious
[01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:39.840]  headgear and it's over
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:41.840]  they die
[01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:43.840]  and in those famous cases
[01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:45.840]  cops beating the daylights out of them for no reason
[01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:47.840]  you see somebody with the striking beard
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:49.840]  and the bright turban
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:51.840]  it's clobbering time
[01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:53.840]  and so he wrote an article about that
[01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:55.840]  and I have to say this
[01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:57.840]  in the aftermath of the shooting
[01:10:57.840 --> 01:10:59.840]  I'll ask him a hard question and put it on the spot
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:01.840]  right out of the gates here
[01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:03.840]  if we have criminal elements of our government
[01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:05.840]  and anybody can just type in
[01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:07.840]  secret testing on US troops
[01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:09.840]  lethal testing on US troops
[01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:11.840]  lethal testing on foster children
[01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:13.840]  a radiation of foster children
[01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:15.840]  thousands of US foster children
[01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:17.840]  the Department of Energy admits
[01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:19.840]  were radiated to death in the 40s, 50s and 60s
[01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:21.840]  110,000 Israeli children
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:23.840]  radiated many of them to death
[01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:25.840]  and the Ringworm Children
[01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:27.840]  Department of Energy paid Israel to kill their own people
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:29.840]  and that's on Israeli TV
[01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:31.840]  just type it into YouTube
[01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:33.840]  you'll see the TV shows about it
[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:35.840]  we're talking about frying kids brains
[01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:37.840]  the ones that were lucky died right away
[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:39.840]  some are still alive today
[01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:41.840]  mentally retarded and no hair
[01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:43.840]  50 years old
[01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:45.840]  this is the type of stuff that goes on
[01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:47.840]  and so if they would do that
[01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:49.840]  shoot black men up with syphilis
[01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:51.840]  the UN's been caught giving foster children
[01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:53.840]  just last year live polio
[01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:55.840]  it's all on purpose folks
[01:11:55.840 --> 01:11:57.840]  and this is a minor footnote
[01:11:57.840 --> 01:11:59.840]  all 67,000 kids got paralyzed
[01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:01.840]  it's no big deal
[01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:03.840]  2011 UN program
[01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:05.840]  why wouldn't they stage a shooting
[01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:07.840]  if they stage fast and furious
[01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:09.840]  and ship guns into Mexico to blame the Second Amendment
[01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:11.840]  that killed thousands conservatively in Mexico
[01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:13.840]  hundreds here in the US including three police officers
[01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:15.840]  one on the board patrol
[01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:17.840]  some say six we can prove three
[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:19.840]  I mean we all know Oklahoma City had government fingerprints
[01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:21.840]  the very same crew that's in power today
[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:23.840]  so I'm going to bring that up to you
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:25.840]  and then just get into the shooting itself
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:27.840]  look at how they're hyping it
[01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:29.840]  look at all the draconian gun bills they've got right now
[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:31.840]  look at how the guy was in army psychological operations
[01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:33.840]  and then suddenly becomes a white supremacist
[01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:35.840]  just like Elohim City
[01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:37.840]  and just how the Feds ran that
[01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:39.840]  in 95
[01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:41.840]  so there's the big question
[01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:43.840]  for William Gregg
[01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:45.840]  will good to have you here
[01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:47.840]  with us on the show
[01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:49.840]  am I out of line
[01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:51.840]  if governments have been caught staging events
[01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:53.840]  like Gulf of Tonkin, Ajax, Gladio
[01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:55.840]  our own government
[01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:57.840]  am I out of line with the opportune timing
[01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:59.840]  of this and the witnesses saying
[01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:01.840]  they saw four men with guns shooting people
[01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:03.840]  and the head of the Sikh community
[01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:05.840]  the president of the group saying there were men
[01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:07.840]  casing a joint before
[01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:09.840]  or should I just believe one guy who happens to be dead
[01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:11.840]  he did it and he's an evil white guy
[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:13.840]  so now we need the war on terror
[01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:15.840]  let's get on to conservative white guys
[01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:17.840]  Alex I think what you're describing is
[01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:19.840]  well within the compass of the official cynicism
[01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:21.840]  of the government that presumes the rulers
[01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:23.840]  it's a question of ability and not disposition
[01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:25.840]  when you're talking about a hypothetical
[01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:27.840]  scenario involving
[01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:29.840]  state shootings or atrocities of this kind
[01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:31.840]  because as you correctly point out
[01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:33.840]  there have been many instances of
[01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:35.840]  off-flight terrorist attacks and similar atrocities
[01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:37.840]  that have been perpetrated in the past
[01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:39.840]  for reasons
[01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:41.840]  of tuning the public atmosphere for
[01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:43.840]  those policy change that requires
[01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:45.840]  the dislocation of comfortable assumptions
[01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:47.840]  the sudden violent shock
[01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:49.840]  that can create a new consensus
[01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:51.840]  and to that list that you mentioned
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:53.840]  of these horrible experiments involving
[01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:55.840]  the
[01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:57.840]  infection of people with various diseases
[01:13:57.840 --> 01:13:59.840]  or other types of assault on the persons you can add
[01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:01.840]  what happened in Guatemala just after World War II
[01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:03.840]  there was a eugenesis program that just
[01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:05.840]  became a matter of public record
[01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:07.840]  just a couple of years ago
[01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:09.840]  and it's no secret that this technocratic
[01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:11.840]  elite that you described
[01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:13.840]  exercises what it considers to be
[01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:15.840]  proprietary claim on the rest of us
[01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:17.840]  they consider us to be their subjects
[01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:19.840]  not only in terms of what we generate
[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:21.840]  what we burn through our exertions and our
[01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:23.840]  industry but also with respect to our
[01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:25.840]  physical person
[01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:27.840]  which explains among other things the Obamacare
[01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:29.840]  monstrosity they really don't recognize
[01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:31.840]  the limit of the power that they presume
[01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:33.840]  to exercise over any of us so
[01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:35.840]  when you're dealing with somebody who comes from
[01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:37.840]  the background that Mr. Page apparently did
[01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:39.840]  and he has an instant of this sort
[01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:41.840]  that has an uncomfortable congruence
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:43.840]  to the scenarios that have been pitched
[01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:45.840]  by the DHS for a number of years
[01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:47.840]  actually going back
[01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:49.840]  before the Obama administration
[01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:51.840]  and the Clinton administration used those scenarios
[01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:53.840]  of this kind being peddled by
[01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:55.840]  what was then sort of the
[01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:57.840]  and co-in-department of Homeland Security
[01:14:57.840 --> 01:14:59.840]  the FBI in particular with its project
[01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:01.840]  MEGADO report in 1999-2000
[01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:03.840]  they've been tuning the atmosphere
[01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:05.840]  for the better part of two decades
[01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:07.840]  about to anticipate this advent
[01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:09.840]  of so-called lone wolf terrorism
[01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:11.840]  that would implicate
[01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:13.840]  the social cohort they call the radical right
[01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:15.840]  so when things like this happen
[01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:17.840]  and once again you have to take into account
[01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:19.840]  what the FBI has been doing for the last
[01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:21.840]  10 years in terms of staging
[01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:23.840]  little melodramas
[01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:25.840]  Homeland Security Theater false flag
[01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:27.840]  terrorist plots involving Muslims
[01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:29.840]  in which you have people that the federal
[01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:31.840]  government refers to as terrorism
[01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:33.840]  facilitators that's actually
[01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:35.840]  the legal documents that refer
[01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:37.840]  to certain people employed by the FBI
[01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:39.840]  as terrorism facilitators
[01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:41.840]  we have instance after instance
[01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:43.840]  in which the Muslims have been manipulated this way
[01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:45.840]  it shouldn't surprise us at all
[01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:47.840]  if we find out that at least
[01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:49.840]  some of these episodes
[01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:51.840]  some of these incidents
[01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:53.840]  are the same fingerprints
[01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:55.840]  and have been orchestrated for the same purposes
[01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:57.840]  particularly you should point out
[01:15:57.840 --> 01:15:59.840]  in light of the accelerating drive
[01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:01.840]  precisely this armament
[01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:03.840]  they've staged up before
[01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:05.840]  they stand to gain from it
[01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:07.840]  it has all the telltale signs
[01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:09.840]  we would be naive
[01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:11.840]  to not look at this as being
[01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:13.840]  at least provocateur
[01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:15.840]  and the evidence I believe
[01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:17.840]  points towards completely
[01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:19.840]  staged with the timing
[01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:21.840]  and all the rest of it
[01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:23.840]  with the Southern Primary Law Center fluttering around
[01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:25.840]  sure and the television
[01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:27.840]  that was playing on Sunday
[01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:29.840]  capitalizing what had happened in Aurora
[01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:31.840]  and then what had happened in Tucson
[01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:33.840]  back in 2011
[01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:35.840]  once again I talk about the idea that
[01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:37.840]  there's a certain harmony
[01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:39.840]  of certain conversions of events here
[01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:41.840]  that drive us in a certain direction
[01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:43.840]  and there are people who do
[01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:45.840]  to the best of their ability
[01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:47.840]  and their ability I think is rather formidable
[01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:49.840]  try to script large scale events of this sort
[01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:51.840]  or to capitalize on things that happen
[01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:53.840]  that are compatible with their agenda
[01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:55.840]  if you're dealing in the first Mr. Page
[01:16:55.840 --> 01:16:57.840]  with somebody who simply
[01:16:57.840 --> 01:16:59.840]  went off on a bender
[01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:01.840]  after being trained
[01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:03.840]  to kill people is a disgruntled former
[01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:05.840]  federal employee that's his most important
[01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:07.840]  affiliation here everything else
[01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:09.840]  is speculative that we do know that this guy
[01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:11.840]  like Timothy McVeigh like the other people
[01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:13.840]  who surrounded McVeigh the others unknown
[01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:15.840]  who conveniently been buffered off the state
[01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:17.840]  these people were
[01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:19.840]  federal employees or former federal employees
[01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:21.840]  take the Joker killer
[01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:23.840]  all federal grants
[01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:25.840]  special Air Force
[01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:27.840]  psychiatrist is signed just to him
[01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:29.840]  people reporting multiple
[01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:31.840]  shooters but that doesn't mean again
[01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:33.840]  it's always people on government payroll
[01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:35.840]  or PSYOP chiefs
[01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:37.840]  or sheet dipped Pentagon folks
[01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:39.840]  like McVeigh that do this
[01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:41.840]  or in the case of the accused or
[01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:43.840]  shooter once again you got the connection to DARPA
[01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:45.840]  which is very much the
[01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:47.840]  past masters of both
[01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:49.840]  technology and psychology
[01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:51.840]  to bring about certain
[01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:53.840]  exactly it's always the same MO
[01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:55.840]  complex yes it's always the same
[01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:57.840]  it's always the same timing
[01:17:57.840 --> 01:17:59.840]  that said then shifting away from
[01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:01.840]  that bottom line giving our liberties
[01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:03.840]  up isn't going to protect us from nuts the answer
[01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:05.840]  is more guns to protect
[01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:07.840]  ourselves that's how the American people are responding
[01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:09.840]  we're about to go to break but
[01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:11.840]  well where would you say
[01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:13.840]  the state of the new world order is right
[01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:15.840]  now are things going well for them or
[01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:17.840]  badly I think
[01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:19.840]  in terms of what they achieve
[01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:21.840]  or what they seek to achieve with respect
[01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:23.840]  consolidation of financial
[01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:25.840]  political power
[01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:27.840]  and also military power things are going
[01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:29.840]  very well for them as they go
[01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:31.840]  increasingly poorly for us we live in a relationship
[01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:33.840]  of inversion
[01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:35.840]  with the people who presume to rule us they're
[01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:37.840]  when you're talking about
[01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:39.840]  particularly the financial element of this
[01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:41.840]  elite they're
[01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:43.840]  giddily buying up
[01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:45.840]  most of the afflicted farmland
[01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:47.840]  in the United States positioning themselves
[01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:49.840]  to act in the same way that the much
[01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:51.840]  integrated purpose and survivalist behave
[01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:53.840]  the differences they're able to do it with
[01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:55.840]  entire huge
[01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:57.840]  tracks of farmland as opposed to having food
[01:18:57.840 --> 01:18:59.840]  stores they can simply buy the farms
[01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:01.840]  and the same things happening in South America
[01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:03.840]  they've been behaving this way since 2008
[01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:05.840]  many of the people who for public consumption
[01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:07.840]  to fail purpose and survivalist
[01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:09.840]  the people in hedge funds and such like
[01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:11.840]  are doing the same thing on a massive
[01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:13.840]  monumentally larger scale
[01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:15.840]  that's something that is to their advantage
[01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:17.840]  it's to their advantage that they're able
[01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:19.840]  to manipulate public opinion through the use
[01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:21.840]  of events of this sort where they're staged
[01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:23.840]  or incidental and of course
[01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:25.840]  to their advantage that we have wars
[01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:27.840]  and rumors of wars
[01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:29.840]  propagating overseas war of course
[01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:31.840]  is something that's very conducive to folding
[01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:33.840]  the public mind into a fashion
[01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:35.840]  where people are receptive to the idea
[01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:37.840]  of surrendering their liberties and surrendering
[01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:39.840]  their individuality in the service of
[01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:41.840]  something supposedly larger than themselves
[01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:43.840]  so as things go poorly for us and
[01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:45.840]  increasingly poorly things go
[01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:47.840]  there for our self-appointed rulers
[01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:49.840]  that's right, killing is their business
[01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:51.840]  business is good
[01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:53.840]  William Greg is our guest

[01:19:55.840 --> 01:19:57.840]  get into the seek angle of this
[01:19:57.840 --> 01:19:59.840]  then we're going to cover drones

[01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:49.840]  that means there's no dangerous fumes

[01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:06.840]  could get me in a lot of trouble
[01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:08.840]  I just created a free video presentation
[01:23:08.840 --> 01:23:10.840]  at 123coverup.com
[01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:12.840]  that exposes the electricity monopolies
[01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:15.840]  and government agencies for what they really are
[01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:18.840]  incompetent, lying crooks that are counting on your ignorance
[01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:20.840]  and fear to keep your power bills
[01:23:20.840 --> 01:23:22.840]  criminally high
[01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:24.840]  some have called this a conspiracy
[01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:27.840]  others have called it a cover up and you will be shocked
[01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:30.840]  to find out how deep the conspiracy goes
[01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:33.840]  my video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth

[01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:33.840]  William Gregg is our guest
[01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:35.840]  writes for lourockwell.com
[01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:38.840]  New American magazine
[01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:42.840]  and of course we also post his fine work
[01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:44.840]  at infowars.com
[01:24:44.840 --> 01:24:46.840]  you can find his books and videos
[01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:48.840]  that are extremely powerful
[01:24:48.840 --> 01:24:50.840]  like global gun grab
[01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:53.840]  he's got that on the whole gun grab
[01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:56.840]  at his website willgregg.com
[01:24:56.840 --> 01:24:58.840]  going back in the short segment we have
[01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:00.840]  next long segment we're going to get into drones
[01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:03.840]  and well really the end of humanity
[01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:05.840]  that's what Bill Joy 12 years ago
[01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:07.840]  called it in Wired Magazine
[01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:10.840]  he called it why the future doesn't need us
[01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:12.840]  we're going to be breaking that down
[01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:14.840]  but I noticed he wrote a story
[01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:16.840]  I guess it was yesterday
[01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:18.840]  breaking down the fact that Sikhs
[01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:20.840]  and up front Sunday I said this could have been
[01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:22.840]  some lunatic
[01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:25.840]  because there's such Islamophobia
[01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:28.840]  where people I talk to think Muslims
[01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:30.840]  every Muslim wants to kill you out there
[01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:32.840]  while western governments bring them in
[01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:34.840]  at record numbers to create that
[01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:36.840]  clash of civilizations it's all a divide
[01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:38.840]  and conquer mechanism
[01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:41.840]  but the fact that the Sikhs
[01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:44.840]  are wearing that archetypal dress
[01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:46.840]  that almost no Muslims wear
[01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:49.840]  because it is a central Asian dress
[01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:51.840]  really a medieval dress
[01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:53.840]  and when cops or anybody sees these
[01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:55.840]  it's almost like a bass fish
[01:25:55.840 --> 01:25:57.840]  seeing a big lured over the water
[01:25:57.840 --> 01:25:59.840]  they just go crazy
[01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:01.840]  and you broke down some cases of
[01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:03.840]  the amazing abuse
[01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:05.840]  the Sikhs have put up with
[01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:07.840]  the one case that I thought was so striking
[01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:09.840]  happened in july of illinois
[01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:11.840]  illinois forgive me
[01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:13.840]  about five years ago
[01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:15.840]  March 11th of 2007 there's a problem
[01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:17.840]  I'm sure I'm going to mispronounce his name
[01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:19.840]  who is a Gulf War veteran
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:22.840]  his name is Koldit Singh Nag
[01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:24.840]  he had served in the first Gulf War
[01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:27.840]  he had a broad star for serving in the military
[01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:29.840]  and for some reason
[01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:31.840]  over the couple of years
[01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:33.840]  he lived in this residential neighborhood
[01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:35.840]  there in Illinois
[01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:37.840]  Mr. Nag and his family had attracted the ire
[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:39.840]  of some of their neighbors
[01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:41.840]  who quite possibly were acting on the perception
[01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:43.840]  that they were dealing with
[01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:45.840]  developers from the Arab world
[01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:47.840]  they had instances of vandalism
[01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:49.840]  where their garage was defaced
[01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:51.840]  and a couple of times somebody tried to be begun
[01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:53.840]  into their property
[01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:55.840]  at some point in early 2007
[01:26:55.840 --> 01:26:57.840]  somebody filed an anonymous complaint
[01:26:57.840 --> 01:26:59.840]  that Mr. Nag had an inoperable
[01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:01.840]  fan on his property
[01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:03.840]  and under a municipal ordinance there
[01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:05.840]  in july apparently it was
[01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:07.840]  required that he registered this vehicle
[01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:09.840]  in spite of the fact that it was
[01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:11.840]  inoperable and out of his own property
[01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:13.840]  so in the morning of March 11th
[01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:15.840]  a police officer
[01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:17.840]  his name was Ben Grant
[01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:19.840]  who knocked on the door
[01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:21.840]  and announced that he was going to tow away the van
[01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:23.840]  and this is the first time that the Nag family
[01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:25.840]  had been informed that there was a problem
[01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:27.840]  according to the municipal ordinance
[01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:29.840]  they should have received at least one notice
[01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:31.840]  but they never did
[01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:33.840]  that they needed to register the van
[01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:35.840]  and so Mr. Nag got upset
[01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:37.840]  within a few seconds he was being beaten
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:39.840]  by Officer Grant
[01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:41.840]  and out of Mr. Grant's tax baton mouth
[01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:43.840]  came the familiar string of profanities
[01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:45.840]  where I'm going to kill you
[01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:47.840]  as he beat this man with a baton
[01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:49.840]  and threw a face down and handcuffed him
[01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:51.840]  and called in a report that he had been assaulted
[01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:53.840]  by Mr. Nag
[01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:55.840]  and he was eventually convicted of aggravated assault
[01:27:55.840 --> 01:27:57.840]  and his assault consisted of desperately throwing
[01:27:57.840 --> 01:27:59.840]  his arms up to try to ward off
[01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:01.840]  these completely unprovoked blows
[01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:03.840]  by a police baton
[01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:05.840]  apparently impeding the cranium bound trajectory
[01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:07.840]  of a police baton constitutes
[01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:09.840]  aggravated assault
[01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:11.840]  No courts have ruled that
[01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:13.840]  nobody would attack you with a deadly weapon
[01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:15.840]  for no reason
[01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:17.840]  I would be able to control myself
[01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:19.840]  I just can't handle
[01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:21.840]  the image of these bullies
[01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:23.840]  when somebody is down, kick them in the face
[01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:25.840]  and if you cover your face
[01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:27.840]  they charge you
[01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:29.840]  it is just an incredible crime
[01:28:29.840 --> 01:28:31.840]  For instance, I've seen people literally be charged
[01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:33.840]  with assaulting an officer from bleeding on the fists
[01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:35.840]  that are beating them
[01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:37.840]  and that's part of what I call the martial law mind
[01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:39.840]  set the idea that we have
[01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:41.840]  an immediate unconditional submission
[01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:43.840]  to anybody in the government who should cost him
[01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:45.840]  who orders us to do something
[01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:47.840]  in a free society that's worthy of that description
[01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:49.840]  nobody who's a government employee
[01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:51.840]  would be able to exercise
[01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:53.840]  that supposed authority over
[01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:55.840]  Let's be honest, they're getting rid of the private property
[01:28:55.840 --> 01:28:57.840]  in the free speech next
[01:28:57.840 --> 01:28:59.840]  there's really nothing left
[01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:01.840]  but the second amendment
[01:29:01.840 --> 01:29:03.840]  we're not a free country anymore
[01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:05.840]  we've been conquered by criminal elements
[01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:07.840]  and they've trained and hyped up the system
[01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:09.840]  that's apparently what's happening
[01:29:09.840 --> 01:29:11.840]  I can't disagree with that assessment
[01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:13.840]  as much as it pains me to admit it
[01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:15.840]  I do think that one of the reasons
[01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:17.840]  we're seeing such a drive right now
[01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:19.840]  to promote civilian disarmament
[01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:21.840]  is the idea that within a couple of years
[01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:23.840]  the powers that they are going to be dealing
[01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:25.840]  with full spectrum operations
[01:29:25.840 --> 01:29:27.840]  in the homeland
[01:29:27.840 --> 01:29:29.840]  which is the name of an essay from small wars journal
[01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:31.840]  that just came out within the last couple of weeks
[01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:33.840]  Yeah, let's pull that up
[01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:35.840]  in fact I saw that, give us that title again
[01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:37.840]  Full spectrum operations
[01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:39.840]  in the homeland, a vision of the future
[01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:41.840]  it's in the small wars journal
[01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:43.840]  and the authors are Kevin Benson
[01:29:43.840 --> 01:29:45.840]  who's a retired criminal
[01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:47.840]  Yeah, stay there, we're going to come back with that
[01:29:47.840 --> 01:30:15.840]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run
[01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:17.840]  at infowars.com
[01:30:17.840 --> 01:30:19.840]  its filters are silver and pregnant
[01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:21.840]  to prevent bacterial growth
[01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:23.840]  there's no priming required
[01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:25.840]  it's NSF42 certified
[01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:27.840]  optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride
[01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:29.840]  up to 95%
[01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:31.840]  easy to set up and use
[01:30:31.840 --> 01:30:33.840]  doesn't require electricity
[01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:35.840]  purify water from lake streams, ponds and wells
[01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:37.840]  this filter system leaves in beneficial minerals
[01:30:37.840 --> 01:30:39.840]  which is key
[01:30:39.840 --> 01:30:41.840]  save money by not buying bottled water
[01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:43.840]  and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic
[01:30:43.840 --> 01:30:45.840]  it's what my family uses

[01:31:05.840 --> 01:31:07.840]  near the Arctic Circle?
[01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:09.840]  Did you know that in a real meltdown
[01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:11.840]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?

[01:33:30.840 --> 01:33:33.840]  what we are looking at
[01:33:33.840 --> 01:33:35.840]  good and evil
[01:33:35.840 --> 01:33:37.840]  right and wrong
[01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:50.840]  alright, we have done countless reports on this
[01:33:50.840 --> 01:33:53.840]  we have
[01:33:53.840 --> 01:33:55.840]  had many guest on breaking it down
[01:33:55.840 --> 01:33:57.840]  but now it's here
[01:33:57.840 --> 01:33:59.840]  about 12 years ago
[01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:01.840]  I began to read public Pentagon
[01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:03.840]  documents
[01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:05.840]  where they said
[01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:07.840]  there won't be any
[01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:09.840]  astronauts
[01:34:09.840 --> 01:34:11.840]  there won't be any submariners
[01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:13.840]  there won't be anybody on ships
[01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:15.840]  unless it's in repair
[01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:17.840]  there won't be any submarines as I said
[01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:19.840]  there won't be any men in aircraft
[01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:21.840]  or women for that matter
[01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:23.840]  force
[01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:25.840]  women in combat roles
[01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:27.840]  it's all a done issue
[01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:29.840]  it's all over
[01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:31.840]  the globalists who think of us as animals
[01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:33.840]  that think of us as human resources
[01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:35.840]  to be used
[01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:37.840]  they have made the decision
[01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:43.840]  to get humans out of all the decision-making
[01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:45.840]  processes
[01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:47.840]  when they made workers work more than 18 hours a day
[01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:49.840]  with almost no pay
[01:34:49.840 --> 01:34:51.840]  working their fingers to the bloody bone
[01:34:51.840 --> 01:34:53.840]  because Al Gore is so greedy
[01:34:53.840 --> 01:34:55.840]  at Apple that they
[01:34:55.840 --> 01:34:57.840]  had the worst working conditions basically in China
[01:34:57.840 --> 01:34:59.840]  because he's
[01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:01.840]  on the board making the decisions because he's so liberal
[01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:03.840]  so trendy and so loving
[01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:05.840]  and so good
[01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:07.840]  when that happened
[01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:09.840]  they said you know what
[01:35:09.840 --> 01:35:11.840]  instead of putting up suicide nets
[01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:13.840]  get rid of the people bring in robots
[01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:15.840]  and it's one thing
[01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:17.840]  of a corporation replaces humans with robots
[01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:19.840]  and then have robots making the robots
[01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:21.840]  which they advertise on television
[01:35:21.840 --> 01:35:23.840]  these big corporations are bragging
[01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:25.840]  that soon there'll be no humans
[01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:27.840]  involved anywhere from mining
[01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:29.840]  the material all the way
[01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:31.840]  to delivering the product
[01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:33.840]  Google cars are getting authorized
[01:35:33.840 --> 01:35:35.840]  for the road all of it but here's the problem
[01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:37.840]  they're already saying
[01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:39.840]  that the cars are safer than humans
[01:35:39.840 --> 01:35:41.840]  and so that humans won't be allowed
[01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:43.840]  to drive soon
[01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:45.840]  they're already deciding the cars with cameras
[01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:47.840]  and the police that watch you
[01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:49.840]  because a child might get left in the car and die
[01:35:49.840 --> 01:35:51.840]  so the police have to watch you
[01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:53.840]  they're already admitting your laptop is watching you
[01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:55.840]  it's beyond 1984
[01:35:55.840 --> 01:35:57.840]  and so humans
[01:35:57.840 --> 01:35:59.840]  are allowing the technological
[01:35:59.840 --> 01:36:01.840]  controllers the technocrats as they call themselves
[01:36:01.840 --> 01:36:03.840]  to take our tax
[01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:05.840]  money and our inventions and our ingenuity
[01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:07.840]  and wall us out of society
[01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:09.840]  and that's why Bill Joy
[01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:11.840]  back in 2000
[01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:13.840]  was at the April issue of Wired Magazine
[01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:15.840]  he wrote why the future does it need us
[01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:17.840]  you can pull it up it's online
[01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:19.840]  and he said yeah I recently went
[01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:21.840]  and had dinner with 200 company owners
[01:36:21.840 --> 01:36:23.840]  he was the owner of Sun Microsystems
[01:36:25.840 --> 01:36:27.840]  and we had a debate
[01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:29.840]  do we kill everybody or do we allow
[01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:31.840]  some to live
[01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:33.840]  but just let them play games online
[01:36:33.840 --> 01:36:35.840]  and basically
[01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:37.840]  it's like the people you see in Wally
[01:36:37.840 --> 01:36:39.840]  that are on the big cruise ship
[01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:41.840]  and can't walk
[01:36:41.840 --> 01:36:43.840]  without the aid of robots
[01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:45.840]  there's either that future
[01:36:45.840 --> 01:36:47.840]  this is what the elite are saying
[01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:49.840]  but they call themselves the elite
[01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:51.840]  the alpha predators
[01:36:51.840 --> 01:36:53.840]  there's either that future
[01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:55.840]  where were these waddling creatures
[01:36:57.840 --> 01:36:59.840]  or
[01:36:59.840 --> 01:37:01.840]  there's just get rid of assault
[01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:03.840]  and Dick Cheney wrote the September 20th
[01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:05.840]  2000 document
[01:37:05.840 --> 01:37:07.840]  he just said create race specific bio weapons
[01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:09.840]  and we'll start wiping out certain races of people
[01:37:09.840 --> 01:37:11.840]  and he said we need to have the media
[01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:13.840]  legitimize its use
[01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:15.840]  only one newspaper
[01:37:15.840 --> 01:37:17.840]  wrote an article saying it was bad
[01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:19.840]  strangely enough it was the Austin
[01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:21.840]  America statesman that's a terrible globalist
[01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:23.840]  publication but maybe
[01:37:23.840 --> 01:37:25.840]  that even got to them
[01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:27.840]  so here's the deal folks
[01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:29.840]  I'm not worried if my hair
[01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:31.840]  is falling out
[01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:33.840]  I'm not worried if I got a
[01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:35.840]  blemish on my nose
[01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:37.840]  I'm not worried what my neighbors
[01:37:37.840 --> 01:37:39.840]  think about me
[01:37:39.840 --> 01:37:41.840]  most people are caught and paralyzed
[01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:43.840]  in this trendiness
[01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:45.840]  where it's just all about their own ego
[01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:47.840]  folks we've got eugenicist
[01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:49.840]  neo feudal fascist
[01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:51.840]  who are anti free market, anti family
[01:37:51.840 --> 01:37:53.840]  who by the way happen to be a cultist
[01:37:53.840 --> 01:37:55.840]  on top of it
[01:37:55.840 --> 01:37:57.840]  I didn't even cover that issue
[01:37:57.840 --> 01:37:59.840]  17 years ago but the research kept running
[01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:01.840]  into that who are basically megalomaniacs
[01:38:01.840 --> 01:38:03.840]  you heard about Nero, Stalin
[01:38:03.840 --> 01:38:05.840]  Hitler, Montezuma
[01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:07.840]  you know crazy people
[01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:09.840]  get in and do horrible things
[01:38:09.840 --> 01:38:11.840]  now they are announcing
[01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:13.840]  oh guess what we did have space planes
[01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:15.840]  that were robot in space
[01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:17.840]  oh guess what the air force will completely
[01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:19.840]  convert to drones
[01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:21.840]  oh guess what
[01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:23.840]  we are going to have the entire submarine fleet be robot
[01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:25.840]  oh guess what
[01:38:25.840 --> 01:38:27.840]  we do have combat robots
[01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:29.840]  we didn't want to show them to you because they're scary looking
[01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:31.840]  but
[01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:33.840]  have you seen Terminator
[01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:35.840]  that's not
[01:38:35.840 --> 01:38:37.840]  life imitating art now
[01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:39.840]  with Skynet that's
[01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:41.840]  art imitating life when you read about
[01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:43.840]  the matrix and I'm not saying they'll ever be able
[01:38:43.840 --> 01:38:45.840]  to do all this this is what they're theorizing
[01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:47.840]  there's a DARPA document
[01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:49.840]  from 1978
[01:38:49.840 --> 01:38:51.840]  or is it 76 I'm going from memory
[01:38:51.840 --> 01:38:53.840]  it's in my book it's out of print it's sent to
[01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:55.840]  tyranny but it's online at presentplanet.tv
[01:38:55.840 --> 01:38:57.840]  then we're going to our guest
[01:38:57.840 --> 01:38:59.840]  this is a background knowledge here
[01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:01.840]  problems I can't start talking about this and then shut up
[01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:03.840]  we're going to go to him
[01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:05.840]  and I apologize that I'm ranting
[01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:07.840]  and they say in there
[01:39:07.840 --> 01:39:09.840]  well we'll just for everyone's safety
[01:39:09.840 --> 01:39:11.840]  we'll just wire into everybody's brain
[01:39:11.840 --> 01:39:13.840]  give them unlimited pleasure
[01:39:13.840 --> 01:39:15.840]  give them a virtual reality to live in
[01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:17.840]  and as moral as long as they're not in pain
[01:39:17.840 --> 01:39:19.840]  and we'll put you in a tank
[01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:21.840]  and the heat from your own body
[01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:23.840]  will be used to power the electronics
[01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:25.840]  you may have seen
[01:39:25.840 --> 01:39:27.840]  that in the 1999 film called The Matrix
[01:39:27.840 --> 01:39:29.840]  yeah
[01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:31.840]  that movie didn't think of any of that
[01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:33.840]  this is what DARPA is thinking of
[01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:35.840]  and by the way they implement most of what
[01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:37.840]  they end up really pushing for
[01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:39.840]  our society
[01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:41.840]  is a DARPA world
[01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:47.840]  let's go back
[01:39:47.840 --> 01:39:49.840]  to author, researcher, filmmaker
[01:39:49.840 --> 01:39:51.840]  willgreg, will greg.com
[01:39:51.840 --> 01:39:53.840]  greg is g-r-i-g-g.com
[01:39:53.840 --> 01:39:55.840]  excellent site recommend folks check that out
[01:39:55.840 --> 01:39:57.840]  will
[01:39:57.840 --> 01:39:59.840]  you've heard my little five minute rant here
[01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:01.840]  they're now making the announcement
[01:40:01.840 --> 01:40:03.840]  and you've written some excellent articles
[01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:05.840]  breaking down how sexy it is
[01:40:05.840 --> 01:40:07.840]  they're getting
[01:40:07.840 --> 01:40:09.840]  battle stars
[01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:11.840]  for sitting there in their air conditioning
[01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:13.840]  and it's manly to kill a couple hundred people
[01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:15.840]  if you get one guy, no judge, no jury
[01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:17.840]  it's always of course
[01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:19.840]  violates the Geneva Convention
[01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:21.840]  our own rules but now they're saying
[01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:23.840]  the drones will be here
[01:40:23.840 --> 01:40:25.840]  we're getting into that document
[01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:27.840]  full spectrum dominance
[01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:29.840]  here in und homeland
[01:40:29.840 --> 01:40:31.840]  full spectrum operations in the homeland
[01:40:31.840 --> 01:40:33.840]  the vision of the future
[01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:35.840]  and we're talking about full spectrum of course
[01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:37.840]  that entails the use
[01:40:37.840 --> 01:40:39.840]  of all the technology that's been deployed in
[01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:41.840]  Afghanistan and Pakistan and Somalia
[01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:43.840]  and Yemen and points unknown
[01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:45.840]  including the use of
[01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:47.840]  mandirical vehicles or drones
[01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:49.840]  that will be used to conduct surveillance
[01:40:49.840 --> 01:40:51.840]  and also to conduct kill missions
[01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:53.840]  two precedents, at least two
[01:40:53.840 --> 01:40:55.840]  there are probably more
[01:40:55.840 --> 01:40:57.840]  but two very important ones
[01:40:57.840 --> 01:40:59.840]  involving the summary execution of U.S. citizens
[01:40:59.840 --> 01:41:01.840]  on presidential orders by way of the drone-fired missile
[01:41:01.840 --> 01:41:03.840]  the first was Anwar al-Awqi
[01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:05.840]  who was accused but never
[01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:07.840]  formally charged with various
[01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:09.840]  crimes of subversion and petition
[01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:11.840]  and such like
[01:41:11.840 --> 01:41:13.840]  he was executed by
[01:41:13.840 --> 01:41:15.840]  a drone-fired missile
[01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:17.840]  in the country of Yemen
[01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:19.840]  on the specific explicit orders of Barack Obama
[01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:21.840]  who told his underlings
[01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:23.840]  I want Anwar al-Awqi
[01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:25.840]  and by the way they say that
[01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:27.840]  to make it sound like he's James Bond
[01:41:27.840 --> 01:41:29.840]  we don't even know if any of that's true
[01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:31.840]  and his family got killed reportedly
[01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:33.840]  because Fox News had reported he was really
[01:41:33.840 --> 01:41:35.840]  meeting with the secretary of the army
[01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:37.840]  when he was on the most wanted list
[01:41:37.840 --> 01:41:39.840]  and was a high level agent
[01:41:39.840 --> 01:41:41.840]  so that was probably just them publicly retiring
[01:41:41.840 --> 01:41:43.840]  one of their assets
[01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:45.840]  and they may have actually killed him
[01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:47.840]  they're so traitorous to their own operas
[01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:49.840]  consider once again the inexhaustible cynicism
[01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:51.840]  of the people we're dealing with
[01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:53.840]  but we do know that a couple weeks later
[01:41:53.840 --> 01:41:55.840]  there was another drone strike on
[01:41:55.840 --> 01:41:57.840]  the 16-year-old son of Mr. Al-Awqi
[01:41:57.840 --> 01:41:59.840]  who apparently got to Yemen
[01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:01.840]  searching for his father who had been publicly named
[01:42:01.840 --> 01:42:03.840]  as somebody on a kill list
[01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:05.840]  so they've established a precedent here
[01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:07.840]  by making the claim and exercising
[01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:09.840]  the supposed authority to bring about
[01:42:09.840 --> 01:42:11.840]  the summary execution of U.S. citizens
[01:42:11.840 --> 01:42:13.840]  by way of drone-fired missiles
[01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:15.840]  and of course this year we see that
[01:42:15.840 --> 01:42:17.840]  drones for domestic law enforcement
[01:42:17.840 --> 01:42:19.840]  applications are becoming a more
[01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:21.840]  and more commonplace thing they've been in the pipeline
[01:42:21.840 --> 01:42:23.840]  as you point out Alex for many years
[01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:25.840]  there have been a couple of instances
[01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:27.840]  where there have been sheriff's departments
[01:42:27.840 --> 01:42:29.840]  who publicly denied that they have received
[01:42:29.840 --> 01:42:31.840]  Homeland Security grants, a Pentagon grant
[01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:33.840]  to obtain drones
[01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:35.840]  but they have nonetheless obtained them
[01:42:35.840 --> 01:42:37.840]  there was a leak a couple of months ago
[01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:39.840]  describing the FAA's licensing permits
[01:42:39.840 --> 01:42:41.840]  for the operation of domestic
[01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:43.840]  drones in various places in the United States
[01:42:43.840 --> 01:42:45.840]  a number of people were surprised to find out
[01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:47.840]  that their local police department
[01:42:47.840 --> 01:42:49.840]  the local sheriff's department
[01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:51.840]  has been put on that list and they are getting
[01:42:51.840 --> 01:42:53.840]  prepared now to upgrade their services
[01:42:53.840 --> 01:42:55.840]  to include these devices
[01:42:55.840 --> 01:42:57.840]  and we have just last week
[01:42:57.840 --> 01:42:59.840]  a court ruling
[01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:01.840]  authorizing or vindicating after the fact
[01:43:01.840 --> 01:43:03.840]  the use of two drones
[01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:05.840]  operated by the Department of Homeland Security
[01:43:05.840 --> 01:43:07.840]  to help conduct the arrest
[01:43:07.840 --> 01:43:09.840]  of the sons
[01:43:09.840 --> 01:43:11.840]  of a farmer by the name of Brassard in North Dakota
[01:43:11.840 --> 01:43:13.840]  he'd been arrested the day before
[01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:15.840]  by the local sheriff's office
[01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:17.840]  with whom he'd had some trouble over the course of
[01:43:17.840 --> 01:43:19.840]  a number of years
[01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:21.840]  there's trouble sheriff's department here
[01:43:21.840 --> 01:43:23.840]  Mr. Brassard and his family are farmers
[01:43:23.840 --> 01:43:25.840]  that had
[01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:27.840]  distanced with their neighbors
[01:43:27.840 --> 01:43:29.840]  and in this particular instance they were
[01:43:29.840 --> 01:43:31.840]  involved in dispute over wandering cattle
[01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:33.840]  which the media spun
[01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:35.840]  as rustling
[01:43:35.840 --> 01:43:37.840]  and so now the sheriff's department called in Homeland Security
[01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:39.840]  and the Air Force with air support
[01:43:39.840 --> 01:43:41.840]  and that's what they're now announcing
[01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:43.840]  I've talked to police but it's also in the documents
[01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:45.840]  you mentioned that full spectrum dominance
[01:43:45.840 --> 01:43:47.840]  report I was just showing it on screen
[01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:49.840]  for PrisonPlanet.TV viewers
[01:43:49.840 --> 01:43:51.840]  it's got army
[01:43:51.840 --> 01:43:53.840]  entering our houses it covers everything
[01:43:53.840 --> 01:43:55.840]  they're going to do to us
[01:43:55.840 --> 01:43:57.840]  the loving gun confiscation everything
[01:43:57.840 --> 01:43:59.840]  go ahead
[01:43:59.840 --> 01:44:01.840]  well all these things have been done overseas by the U.S. military
[01:44:01.840 --> 01:44:03.840]  in the course of what is called operations
[01:44:03.840 --> 01:44:05.840]  other than war
[01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:07.840]  WOTWO12
[01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:09.840]  in which you have police officers
[01:44:09.840 --> 01:44:11.840]  acting
[01:44:11.840 --> 01:44:13.840]  as reservists to National Guard
[01:44:13.840 --> 01:44:15.840]  operatives, National Guard soldiers
[01:44:15.840 --> 01:44:17.840]  sent overseas as part of military operations
[01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:19.840]  where they behave as police officers
[01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:21.840]  in countries such as Afghanistan
[01:44:21.840 --> 01:44:23.840]  or Haiti, Somalia, you know the list
[01:44:23.840 --> 01:44:25.840]  and then once they've developed this ability
[01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:27.840]  they come back
[01:44:27.840 --> 01:44:29.840]  and they start doing the same things domestically
[01:44:29.840 --> 01:44:31.840]  one of the things that I find
[01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:33.840]  quite fascinating is that if you take a look
[01:44:33.840 --> 01:44:35.840]  at military deployments in the 1990s
[01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:37.840]  during the first Bush administration
[01:44:37.840 --> 01:44:39.840]  and during the Clinton administration
[01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:41.840]  you have episodes of what is called
[01:44:41.840 --> 01:44:43.840]  in the literature micro disarmament
[01:44:43.840 --> 01:44:45.840]  micro disarmament is as you say Alex
[01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:47.840]  the confiscation of firearms
[01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:49.840]  using gun registry lists
[01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:51.840]  this happened in Haiti for instance
[01:44:51.840 --> 01:44:53.840]  in Haiti you could own just about any firearm
[01:44:53.840 --> 01:44:55.840]  or explosive device you wanted
[01:44:55.840 --> 01:44:57.840]  as long as you registered with the local
[01:44:57.840 --> 01:44:59.840]  constabulary once the name
[01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:01.840]  and the firearms
[01:45:01.840 --> 01:45:03.840]  or explosives were in the registry
[01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:05.840]  the United States military which invaded
[01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:07.840]  in I believe 1994 if memory serves
[01:45:07.840 --> 01:45:09.840]  in order to reinstall
[01:45:09.840 --> 01:45:11.840]  Aristide who was not
[01:45:11.840 --> 01:45:13.840]  particularly desirable ruler
[01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:15.840]  had been thrown out of the country by military
[01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:17.840]  acting on the supposed authority
[01:45:17.840 --> 01:45:19.840]  of the U.N. Security Council
[01:45:19.840 --> 01:45:21.840]  resolution U.S. military invaded
[01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:23.840]  Haiti and reinstalled
[01:45:23.840 --> 01:45:25.840]  Aristide at bayonet point and part
[01:45:25.840 --> 01:45:27.840]  of this involved disarming anybody who could put up a fuss
[01:45:27.840 --> 01:45:29.840]  to fight back against this
[01:45:29.840 --> 01:45:31.840]  probably deranged Marxist ruler
[01:45:31.840 --> 01:45:33.840]  and so they went door to door collecting
[01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:35.840]  firearms using gun registration lists
[01:45:35.840 --> 01:45:37.840]  this is called micro disarmament
[01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:39.840]  as our gun buy backs and turn in
[01:45:39.840 --> 01:45:41.840]  programs we have those happening
[01:45:41.840 --> 01:45:43.840]  all throughout the United States
[01:45:43.840 --> 01:45:45.840]  every single year and they have gun buy back
[01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:47.840]  to create the news images of people lined
[01:45:47.840 --> 01:45:49.840]  up turning guns in to create the perception
[01:45:49.840 --> 01:45:51.840]  that guns are bad they're the police
[01:45:51.840 --> 01:45:53.840]  exactly to acclimate
[01:45:53.840 --> 01:45:55.840]  but again as you just pointed out
[01:45:55.840 --> 01:45:57.840]  the U.S. military are masters
[01:45:57.840 --> 01:45:59.840]  of gun disarmament of the general public
[01:45:59.840 --> 01:46:01.840]  as they call it micro disarmament
[01:46:01.840 --> 01:46:03.840]  and the new U.N. treaty you made a film on this
[01:46:03.840 --> 01:46:05.840]  breaks down an article
[01:46:05.840 --> 01:46:07.840]  15 they're right there
[01:46:07.840 --> 01:46:09.840]  saying that states will aid other states
[01:46:09.840 --> 01:46:11.840]  and the U.N. in micro disarmament
[01:46:11.840 --> 01:46:13.840]  and they admit that that's their plan
[01:46:13.840 --> 01:46:15.840]  I mean it's just incredible
[01:46:15.840 --> 01:46:17.840]  that we're this far down the line
[01:46:17.840 --> 01:46:19.840]  and now they want to use the drones
[01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:21.840]  you know please continue
[01:46:21.840 --> 01:46:23.840]  but I want to get back into the drones
[01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:25.840]  do you see the same path
[01:46:25.840 --> 01:46:27.840]  that I see us going down
[01:46:27.840 --> 01:46:29.840]  the system is now going to autonomous
[01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:31.840]  drones or it's not even these
[01:46:31.840 --> 01:46:33.840]  heroes in the air conditioning killing people
[01:46:33.840 --> 01:46:35.840]  to where the technocrats literally
[01:46:35.840 --> 01:46:37.840]  have armies of their own combat mechs
[01:46:37.840 --> 01:46:39.840]  this is in the literature
[01:46:39.840 --> 01:46:41.840]  you pointed out they aspire
[01:46:41.840 --> 01:46:43.840]  to do this whether their ability will match
[01:46:43.840 --> 01:46:45.840]  their aspirations I can't tell you but they certainly
[01:46:45.840 --> 01:46:47.840]  have envisioned a scenario
[01:46:47.840 --> 01:46:49.840]  in which you'd have this sky net
[01:46:49.840 --> 01:46:51.840]  type of vertically integrated and thoroughly
[01:46:51.840 --> 01:46:53.840]  mechanized system or use
[01:46:53.840 --> 01:46:55.840]  the battle star galactic idiom that
[01:46:55.840 --> 01:46:57.840]  looked like the pylons were
[01:46:57.840 --> 01:46:59.840]  fully mechanized and independently
[01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:01.840]  autonomously functioning
[01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:05.840]  mechanisms of death that
[01:47:05.840 --> 01:47:07.840]  are involved in routine
[01:47:07.840 --> 01:47:09.840]  punitive strikes
[01:47:09.840 --> 01:47:11.840]  which carry out programs intended
[01:47:11.840 --> 01:47:13.840]  to spare the exposure
[01:47:13.840 --> 01:47:15.840]  of military personnel to the dangers
[01:47:15.840 --> 01:47:17.840]  that would be involved in actually carrying out
[01:47:17.840 --> 01:47:19.840]  these missions I mean obviously cyber war
[01:47:19.840 --> 01:47:21.840]  that's long distance war
[01:47:21.840 --> 01:47:23.840]  involving drone strikes right now
[01:47:23.840 --> 01:47:25.840]  is a generous
[01:47:25.840 --> 01:47:27.840]  step along that direction and I want to
[01:47:27.840 --> 01:47:29.840]  make a point here that really the most
[01:47:29.840 --> 01:47:31.840]  dangerous drone
[01:47:31.840 --> 01:47:33.840]  is the one that is operating the joystick
[01:47:33.840 --> 01:47:35.840]  and not the one operated by the joystick
[01:47:35.840 --> 01:47:37.840]  the drone being the human drone
[01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:39.840]  who sits in one of these air conditioned
[01:47:39.840 --> 01:47:41.840]  air conditioned offices
[01:47:41.840 --> 01:47:43.840]  in the batter but yeah you quoted some of them
[01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:45.840]  from the New York Times where they were just like
[01:47:45.840 --> 01:47:47.840]  I do not think about who I'm killing
[01:47:47.840 --> 01:47:49.840]  I do what I am told
[01:47:49.840 --> 01:47:51.840]  they are bad
[01:47:51.840 --> 01:47:53.840]  they are converting this as the exact same
[01:47:53.840 --> 01:47:55.840]  nomenclature against us
[01:47:55.840 --> 01:47:57.840]  exactly the idea
[01:47:57.840 --> 01:47:59.840]  full spectrum dominance means that
[01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:01.840]  there is literally no security
[01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:03.840]  that one can
[01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:05.840]  find against the aspirations
[01:48:05.840 --> 01:48:07.840]  of those who want to assert the dominance
[01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:09.840]  we are completely deprived of any means
[01:48:09.840 --> 01:48:11.840]  of resisting anything that our masters
[01:48:11.840 --> 01:48:13.840]  want to inflict upon us
[01:48:13.840 --> 01:48:15.840]  and that's the term of art that started
[01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:17.840]  to come into the literature about 15 or 16
[01:48:17.840 --> 01:48:19.840]  years ago now they are talking about it
[01:48:19.840 --> 01:48:21.840]  not only in terms of operations other than war
[01:48:21.840 --> 01:48:23.840]  overseas but here domestically
[01:48:23.840 --> 01:48:25.840]  obviously if you have a situation where
[01:48:25.840 --> 01:48:27.840]  these things are being carried out
[01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:29.840]  by soulless machines
[01:48:29.840 --> 01:48:31.840]  operated by people who surrendered their souls
[01:48:31.840 --> 01:48:33.840]  who were inaccessible then by definition
[01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:35.840]  they are invulnerable
[01:48:35.840 --> 01:48:37.840]  they are completely beyond any kind of retaliatory
[01:48:37.840 --> 01:48:39.840]  action that's the type of
[01:48:39.840 --> 01:48:41.840]  the system that they really want to create
[01:48:41.840 --> 01:48:43.840]  and that's what full spectrum dominance is
[01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:45.840]  so then we have to look at the ruling
[01:48:45.840 --> 01:48:47.840]  controllers and what's their mindset
[01:48:47.840 --> 01:48:49.840]  absolutely vicious arrogant scum
[01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:51.840]  who hate the family who hate
[01:48:51.840 --> 01:48:53.840]  God and when you study the globalist
[01:48:53.840 --> 01:48:55.840]  these are absolute power mad
[01:48:55.840 --> 01:48:57.840]  materialist like Marx
[01:48:57.840 --> 01:48:59.840]  or Lenin or Engels
[01:48:59.840 --> 01:49:01.840]  do you agree with that statement
[01:49:01.840 --> 01:49:03.840]  I don't think that that's an exaggeration
[01:49:03.840 --> 01:49:05.840]  they might not necessarily be
[01:49:05.840 --> 01:49:07.840]  doctrinally committed to the teachings of Marx
[01:49:07.840 --> 01:49:09.840]  or Engels but they certainly
[01:49:09.840 --> 01:49:11.840]  behave in a Leninist fashion
[01:49:11.840 --> 01:49:13.840]  Vladimir Lenin defined his philosophy
[01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:15.840]  of government as power without limit resting
[01:49:15.840 --> 01:49:17.840]  on force and absolutely unimpeded
[01:49:17.840 --> 01:49:19.840]  by laws and whether you're talking about
[01:49:19.840 --> 01:49:21.840]  people who've studied the Marxist
[01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:23.840]  economic chivalry in terms of the way
[01:49:23.840 --> 01:49:25.840]  that they organize power and exercise it
[01:49:25.840 --> 01:49:27.840]  they're definitely Leninist in practice
[01:49:27.840 --> 01:49:29.840]  that's not something that's confined to one
[01:49:29.840 --> 01:49:31.840]  or the other of the two branches of the incumbent
[01:49:31.840 --> 01:49:33.840]  party that we defied artificially to Republicans
[01:49:33.840 --> 01:49:35.840]  and Democrats this is something that is
[01:49:35.840 --> 01:49:37.840]  shared pretty much by the entire
[01:49:37.840 --> 01:49:39.840]  ruling elite not only politically but
[01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:41.840]  academically and economically and so forth
[01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:43.840]  I think it's worthwhile to point out
[01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:45.840]  that the
[01:49:45.840 --> 01:49:47.840]  aggressive dehumanization of those
[01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:49.840]  targeted by the system is something
[01:49:49.840 --> 01:49:51.840]  that has made a few robots out of
[01:49:51.840 --> 01:49:53.840]  the people who were operating the joysticks
[01:49:53.840 --> 01:49:55.840]  I've referred in an earlier article
[01:49:55.840 --> 01:49:57.840]  to a document that came out in 2002
[01:49:57.840 --> 01:49:59.840]  in anticipation of the Second Gulf War
[01:49:59.840 --> 01:50:01.840]  there was a computer program
[01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:03.840]  called Bug's Splat which referred
[01:50:03.840 --> 01:50:05.840]  to incidental casualties
[01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:07.840]  of civilians in the targeted area
[01:50:07.840 --> 01:50:09.840]  and it was an algorithm
[01:50:09.840 --> 01:50:11.840]  that was supposed to calculate the number
[01:50:11.840 --> 01:50:13.840]  of percentage of people who'd be wiped out
[01:50:13.840 --> 01:50:15.840]  of for instance the 5,000-pound
[01:50:15.840 --> 01:50:17.840]  bomb or lobbed into a residential neighborhood
[01:50:17.840 --> 01:50:19.840]  Baghdad and they calculated
[01:50:19.840 --> 01:50:21.840]  an acceptable percentage of Bug's
[01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:23.840]  Splat in a given operation
[01:50:23.840 --> 01:50:25.840]  Atami Franks who reviewed this
[01:50:25.840 --> 01:50:27.840]  signed off on all 22 of these operations
[01:50:27.840 --> 01:50:29.840]  that involved a high level of what was
[01:50:29.840 --> 01:50:31.840]  called Bug's Splat and to that
[01:50:31.840 --> 01:50:33.840]  ADM was added another expression
[01:50:33.840 --> 01:50:35.840]  squirters which referred to people who were
[01:50:35.840 --> 01:50:37.840]  observed through this surveillance
[01:50:37.840 --> 01:50:39.840]  technology of these drones
[01:50:39.840 --> 01:50:41.840]  who were injured or wounded or trying to
[01:50:41.840 --> 01:50:43.840]  flee these are the types of
[01:50:43.840 --> 01:50:45.840]  terms that are used to create this
[01:50:45.840 --> 01:50:47.840]  moral distance between those
[01:50:47.840 --> 01:50:49.840]  well it makes it fun it makes it
[01:50:49.840 --> 01:50:51.840]  fun but the guys sitting there
[01:50:51.840 --> 01:50:53.840]  doing this they're drinking sodium
[01:50:53.840 --> 01:50:55.840]  fluoride water and they wonder
[01:50:55.840 --> 01:50:57.840]  why at home you know their son is
[01:50:57.840 --> 01:50:59.840]  mentally retarded because they've been hit
[01:50:59.840 --> 01:51:01.840]  as well
[01:51:01.840 --> 01:51:03.840]  Alex Jones here with a great way
[01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:05.840]  to beat the blackouts get off
[01:51:05.840 --> 01:51:07.840]  the grid and generate your own supply
[01:51:07.840 --> 01:51:09.840]  of electrical power folks with what's
[01:51:09.840 --> 01:51:11.840]  been going on in this country I don't
[01:51:11.840 --> 01:51:13.840]  have to tell you about the power grid
[01:51:13.840 --> 01:51:15.840]  and just how vulnerable it is
[01:51:15.840 --> 01:51:17.840]  that's in the mainstream news every day
[01:51:17.840 --> 01:51:19.840]  millions of people have lost their power
[01:51:19.840 --> 01:51:21.840]  in the last few weeks because of dangerous
[01:51:21.840 --> 01:51:23.840]  storms and killer heat that's pushing the
[01:51:23.840 --> 01:51:25.840]  grid beyond its capacity
[01:51:25.840 --> 01:51:27.840]  I've always said that every family needs
[01:51:27.840 --> 01:51:29.840]  to be ready for blackouts and if you
[01:51:29.840 --> 01:51:31.840]  don't have a backup system in place
[01:51:31.840 --> 01:51:33.840]  I've got a great opportunity for you
[01:51:33.840 --> 01:51:35.840]  right now our good friends at solutions
[01:51:35.840 --> 01:51:37.840]  on their best-selling power hub
[01:51:37.840 --> 01:51:39.840]  unit in fact I think it's the best deal
[01:51:39.840 --> 01:51:41.840]  I've ever seen them make it's
[01:51:41.840 --> 01:51:43.840]  literally thousands of dollars in savings
[01:51:43.840 --> 01:51:45.840]  remember these backup systems don't need
[01:51:45.840 --> 01:51:47.840]  gas because they're solar powered
[01:51:47.840 --> 01:51:49.840]  that means there's no dangerous fumes
[01:51:49.840 --> 01:51:51.840]  and no noise info wars listeners

[01:52:07.840 --> 01:52:09.840]  in 1985

[01:52:11.840 --> 01:52:13.840]  carnivora be sent directly to the White House
[01:52:13.840 --> 01:52:15.840]  at a time when only the president could obtain
[01:52:15.840 --> 01:52:17.840]  this world-class healer
[01:52:17.840 --> 01:52:19.840]  now 27 years later

[01:54:29.840 --> 01:54:31.840]  but Obama is leaking
[01:54:31.840 --> 01:54:33.840]  they're looking at Petraeus
[01:54:33.840 --> 01:54:35.840]  to be the VP
[01:54:35.840 --> 01:54:37.840]  with Romney
[01:54:37.840 --> 01:54:39.840]  so we're going to be discussing
[01:54:39.840 --> 01:54:41.840]  that coming up as well
[01:54:41.840 --> 01:54:43.840]  sounds like a great guy for president
[01:54:43.840 --> 01:54:45.840]  I mean he laughs at the CIA
[01:54:45.840 --> 01:54:47.840]  spies on us illegally
[01:54:47.840 --> 01:54:49.840]  through our appliances in public
[01:54:49.840 --> 01:54:51.840]  admits to felonies
[01:54:51.840 --> 01:54:53.840]  so why not have the general
[01:54:53.840 --> 01:54:55.840]  CIA director as the vice president
[01:54:55.840 --> 01:54:57.840]  there's just no end to this and it's all how
[01:54:57.840 --> 01:54:59.840]  their patriots know they're getting
[01:54:59.840 --> 01:55:01.840]  rid of our old republic
[01:55:01.840 --> 01:55:03.840]  because it isn't compatible with their scientific
[01:55:03.840 --> 01:55:05.840]  tyranny
[01:55:05.840 --> 01:55:07.840]  and humans have to take control
[01:55:07.840 --> 01:55:09.840]  of our development we have to
[01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:11.840]  decide that
[01:55:11.840 --> 01:55:13.840]  we're decision makers and that
[01:55:13.840 --> 01:55:15.840]  we understand what's happening
[01:55:15.840 --> 01:55:17.840]  in the architecture
[01:55:17.840 --> 01:55:19.840]  in our society
[01:55:19.840 --> 01:55:21.840]  we cannot just go quietly into the night
[01:55:21.840 --> 01:55:23.840]  because these globalists
[01:55:23.840 --> 01:55:25.840]  are eugenicists
[01:55:25.840 --> 01:55:27.840]  you know you make the point
[01:55:27.840 --> 01:55:29.840]  that we're being turned into these biological androids
[01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:31.840]  and you're absolutely right
[01:55:31.840 --> 01:55:33.840]  why do you need to have combat robots
[01:55:33.840 --> 01:55:35.840]  well you could just brainwash people
[01:55:35.840 --> 01:55:37.840]  with sleep deprivation
[01:55:37.840 --> 01:55:39.840]  and a feeling of elite spree to core
[01:55:39.840 --> 01:55:41.840]  after they've gone through that ritual
[01:55:41.840 --> 01:55:43.840]  to then be willing to do anything
[01:55:43.840 --> 01:55:45.840]  to not buck the peer pressure
[01:55:45.840 --> 01:55:47.840]  and to go out and wage war
[01:55:47.840 --> 01:55:49.840]  against your own people
[01:55:49.840 --> 01:55:51.840]  and if folks think we're decking it now
[01:55:51.840 --> 01:55:53.840]  Will where do you see us going in the future
[01:55:53.840 --> 01:55:55.840]  I think it's important to recognize
[01:55:55.840 --> 01:55:57.840]  that everything they do in terms of refining
[01:55:57.840 --> 01:55:59.840]  the machinery of oppression here is designed to bring about
[01:55:59.840 --> 01:56:01.840]  changes in us assuming
[01:56:01.840 --> 01:56:03.840]  that there will be some of us who will be
[01:56:03.840 --> 01:56:05.840]  privileged to remain rather than being
[01:56:05.840 --> 01:56:07.840]  summarily liquidated and I think that
[01:56:07.840 --> 01:56:09.840]  the people who presume to rule us
[01:56:09.840 --> 01:56:11.840]  want to keep at least enough of us
[01:56:11.840 --> 01:56:13.840]  around in order to provide the raw material
[01:56:13.840 --> 01:56:15.840]  upon which they will insist
[01:56:15.840 --> 01:56:17.840]  and so the takers, the parasites
[01:56:17.840 --> 01:56:19.840]  can't outright kill the hosts
[01:56:19.840 --> 01:56:21.840]  you know the people who are productive
[01:56:21.840 --> 01:56:23.840]  and I think that
[01:56:23.840 --> 01:56:25.840]  the most ominous changes we're talking about here
[01:56:25.840 --> 01:56:27.840]  don't have to do necessarily the technology
[01:56:27.840 --> 01:56:29.840]  involved once again it has to do with
[01:56:29.840 --> 01:56:31.840]  what goes on between the years
[01:56:31.840 --> 01:56:33.840]  of the people who are part of this system
[01:56:33.840 --> 01:56:35.840]  and the militarization of the mindset
[01:56:35.840 --> 01:56:37.840]  of law enforcement specifically
[01:56:37.840 --> 01:56:39.840]  is something that I find quite remarkable
[01:56:39.840 --> 01:56:41.840]  this is what's been going on now for about 40 years
[01:56:41.840 --> 01:56:43.840]  when the US government
[01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:45.840]  decided to start declaring war
[01:56:45.840 --> 01:56:47.840]  on possession of the use of narcotics
[01:56:47.840 --> 01:56:49.840]  or to declare war on terrorism
[01:56:49.840 --> 01:56:51.840]  as happened just a decade or so ago
[01:56:51.840 --> 01:56:53.840]  when the government puts
[01:56:53.840 --> 01:56:55.840]  itself on a war footing domestically
[01:56:55.840 --> 01:56:57.840]  obviously it's talking about
[01:56:57.840 --> 01:56:59.840]  creating a battle zone out of the United States
[01:56:59.840 --> 01:57:01.840]  and that's an expression we find
[01:57:01.840 --> 01:57:03.840]  in this article from Small Wars Journal
[01:57:03.840 --> 01:57:05.840]  the battle zone would be domestic
[01:57:05.840 --> 01:57:07.840]  and this is once again
[01:57:07.840 --> 01:57:09.840]  not a new development in this book
[01:57:09.840 --> 01:57:11.840]  I wrote that you mentioned Global Gun Grab
[01:57:11.840 --> 01:57:13.840]  there's a chapter in here called
[01:57:13.840 --> 01:57:15.840]  the Mayberry that talks about the way
[01:57:15.840 --> 01:57:17.840]  that law enforcement and the military
[01:57:17.840 --> 01:57:19.840]  have been blended and conjoined
[01:57:19.840 --> 01:57:21.840]  and you have the Pentagon
[01:57:21.840 --> 01:57:23.840]  supplying material
[01:57:23.840 --> 01:57:25.840]  arms and all kinds of training
[01:57:25.840 --> 01:57:27.840]  to every police department
[01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:29.840]  of any significant size in the country
[01:57:29.840 --> 01:57:31.840]  I live across the Stake River
[01:57:31.840 --> 01:57:33.840]  from a little town called Ontario Oregon
[01:57:33.840 --> 01:57:35.840]  it's about 12,000 people they have a squad team
[01:57:35.840 --> 01:57:37.840]  that trains here in Idaho
[01:57:37.840 --> 01:57:39.840]  with people who are from the special forces
[01:57:39.840 --> 01:57:41.840]  teach them how to militarize
[01:57:41.840 --> 01:57:43.840]  every encounter between law enforcement and civilians
[01:57:43.840 --> 01:57:45.840]  and we shouldn't be called civilians
[01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:47.840]  by the way the police are the peace
[01:57:47.840 --> 01:57:49.840]  officers should be civilians as well
[01:57:49.840 --> 01:57:51.840]  in Aurora, Colorado
[01:57:51.840 --> 01:57:53.840]  a few weeks before the shooting
[01:57:53.840 --> 01:57:55.840]  there was a bank robbery where the police
[01:57:55.840 --> 01:57:57.840]  simply shut down an entire block
[01:57:57.840 --> 01:57:59.840]  and arrested everybody in sight
[01:57:59.840 --> 01:58:01.840]  creating if you will
[01:58:01.840 --> 01:58:03.840]  sort of a microcosmic
[01:58:03.840 --> 01:58:05.840]  martial law setting
[01:58:05.840 --> 01:58:07.840]  they arrested everybody so they could search their cars
[01:58:07.840 --> 01:58:09.840]  they handcuffed them and then they asked permission to search their cars
[01:58:09.840 --> 01:58:11.840]  if somebody handcuffed
[01:58:11.840 --> 01:58:13.840]  who could resist that offer
[01:58:13.840 --> 01:58:15.840]  and then in Colorado Springs which is just a few miles away
[01:58:15.840 --> 01:58:17.840]  it might be a couple of dozen miles away
[01:58:17.840 --> 01:58:19.840]  from Aurora
[01:58:19.840 --> 01:58:21.840]  you have police wearing squat regalia
[01:58:21.840 --> 01:58:23.840]  as they're carrying out their routine duties
[01:58:23.840 --> 01:58:25.840]  you're
[01:58:25.840 --> 01:58:27.840]  stopped for a speeding and flight
[01:58:27.840 --> 01:58:29.840]  that place is a beta test that's why they staged it there
[01:58:29.840 --> 01:58:31.840]  it's under their control
[01:58:31.840 --> 01:58:33.840]  they did it the whole deal
[01:58:33.840 --> 01:58:35.840]  they're a bunch of terrorists
[01:58:35.840 --> 01:58:37.840]  by the way folks
[01:58:37.840 --> 01:58:39.840]  call this so they can take your private property
[01:59:07.840 --> 01:59:09.840]  that's 70% less than our competitors
[01:59:09.840 --> 01:59:11.840]  you could buy 3 survival seed vaults
[01:59:11.840 --> 01:59:13.840]  for less than one of theirs

[02:00:25.840 --> 02:00:27.840]  alright is a final segment
[02:00:27.840 --> 02:00:29.840]  with William Gregg
[02:00:29.840 --> 02:00:31.840]  very insightful interview today
[02:00:31.840 --> 02:00:33.840]  then we're going to come back from
[02:00:33.840 --> 02:00:35.840]  break go to your phone calls
[02:00:35.840 --> 02:00:37.840]  and then get into all the other news I haven't covered
[02:00:37.840 --> 02:00:39.840]  and boy that's a lot
[02:00:39.840 --> 02:00:41.840]  here on this Tuesday
[02:00:41.840 --> 02:00:43.840]  worldwide transmission
[02:00:43.840 --> 02:00:45.840]  well I've been asking the questions here
[02:00:45.840 --> 02:00:47.840]  in the five minutes we've got left
[02:00:47.840 --> 02:00:49.840]  on your considerable
[02:00:49.840 --> 02:00:51.840]  plate what else is front and center
[02:00:51.840 --> 02:00:53.840]  what else would you like to impart to our
[02:00:53.840 --> 02:00:55.840]  worldwide audience of freedom lovers
[02:00:55.840 --> 02:00:57.840]  I think it's worth
[02:00:57.840 --> 02:00:59.840]  reviewing our assumptions about
[02:00:59.840 --> 02:01:01.840]  how society should provide for security
[02:01:01.840 --> 02:01:03.840]  if we're going to have a free
[02:01:03.840 --> 02:01:05.840]  and reasonably
[02:01:05.840 --> 02:01:07.840]  prosperous society
[02:01:07.840 --> 02:01:09.840]  security has to be something for which the individual takes
[02:01:09.840 --> 02:01:11.840]  responsibility
[02:01:11.840 --> 02:01:13.840]  and we have to start up reading some of the bad assumptions
[02:01:13.840 --> 02:01:15.840]  that have been embedded
[02:01:15.840 --> 02:01:17.840]  in the system of politics under which we live
[02:01:17.840 --> 02:01:19.840]  the first is that the government should have a monopoly
[02:01:19.840 --> 02:01:21.840]  on the use of force
[02:01:21.840 --> 02:01:23.840]  say what you will about the
[02:01:23.840 --> 02:01:25.840]  constitutional republic we were given
[02:01:25.840 --> 02:01:27.840]  one of the really interesting things that distinguishes it
[02:01:27.840 --> 02:01:29.840]  from any other system of government is that
[02:01:29.840 --> 02:01:31.840]  it explicitly propitiated the idea that the government
[02:01:31.840 --> 02:01:33.840]  should have a monopoly on the use of force
[02:01:33.840 --> 02:01:35.840]  that's what the second amendment is about
[02:01:35.840 --> 02:01:37.840]  people getting to arguments about the minutiae
[02:01:37.840 --> 02:01:39.840]  the second amendment of the applications there
[02:01:39.840 --> 02:01:41.840]  what they don't recognize is that by explicitly
[02:01:41.840 --> 02:01:43.840]  recognizing the individual
[02:01:43.840 --> 02:01:45.840]  right to arm self defense that document
[02:01:45.840 --> 02:01:47.840]  repudiates the idea that
[02:01:47.840 --> 02:01:49.840]  government has a monopoly on the use of force
[02:01:49.840 --> 02:01:51.840]  yet every political science class
[02:01:51.840 --> 02:01:53.840]  in this country is going to teach that concept
[02:01:53.840 --> 02:01:55.840]  but that's a Leninist concept not a
[02:01:55.840 --> 02:01:57.840]  Madisonian one if the government doesn't
[02:01:57.840 --> 02:01:59.840]  have a monopoly on the use of force
[02:01:59.840 --> 02:02:01.840]  it stands to reason that the government cannot
[02:02:01.840 --> 02:02:03.840]  use force that the individual is forbidden
[02:02:03.840 --> 02:02:05.840]  to use and that leads us to the non-aggression
[02:02:05.840 --> 02:02:07.840]  principle I have no right
[02:02:07.840 --> 02:02:09.840]  to commit aggression against anybody else and I
[02:02:09.840 --> 02:02:11.840]  have of course the reciprocal right
[02:02:11.840 --> 02:02:13.840]  not to expect to be aggressive against
[02:02:13.840 --> 02:02:15.840]  and it doesn't matter whether the aggression
[02:02:15.840 --> 02:02:17.840]  is committed by some tattooed gangbanger
[02:02:17.840 --> 02:02:19.840]  who's part of a private mob
[02:02:19.840 --> 02:02:21.840]  or some tattooed gangbanger who wears a
[02:02:21.840 --> 02:02:23.840]  government issued costume if it's aggressive violence
[02:02:23.840 --> 02:02:25.840]  it's wrong and I would hope
[02:02:25.840 --> 02:02:27.840]  that what's happening in places
[02:02:27.840 --> 02:02:29.840]  like fulmous in California where there is serious
[02:02:29.840 --> 02:02:31.840]  consideration being given out to disbanding
[02:02:31.840 --> 02:02:33.840]  a police department that is murderous
[02:02:33.840 --> 02:02:35.840]  I would hope that that would start to propagate
[02:02:35.840 --> 02:02:37.840]  itself across the country I've helped
[02:02:37.840 --> 02:02:39.840]  in some very very small way
[02:02:39.840 --> 02:02:41.840]  to bring about the disbanding of a couple
[02:02:41.840 --> 02:02:43.840]  of police departments one in Covenan, Texas
[02:02:43.840 --> 02:02:45.840]  that was being run by a police chief who was
[02:02:45.840 --> 02:02:47.840]  the local drug lord that's certainly not an
[02:02:47.840 --> 02:02:49.840]  uncommon thing going to what goes on
[02:02:49.840 --> 02:02:51.840]  in the name of the war on drugs
[02:02:51.840 --> 02:02:53.840]  and what's happening is the pressures of the
[02:02:53.840 --> 02:02:55.840]  financial collapse are becoming more acute
[02:02:55.840 --> 02:02:57.840]  is that a lot of municipalities
[02:02:57.840 --> 02:02:59.840]  learning that they can't afford to spend
[02:02:59.840 --> 02:03:01.840]  the money that's been set aside
[02:03:01.840 --> 02:03:03.840]  in these non-funded
[02:03:03.840 --> 02:03:05.840]  attention for police chiefs
[02:03:05.840 --> 02:03:07.840]  to pull down $200,000
[02:03:07.840 --> 02:03:09.840]  after working for 18 months
[02:03:09.840 --> 02:03:11.840]  I saw a police chief
[02:03:11.840 --> 02:03:13.840]  in a small town in California
[02:03:13.840 --> 02:03:15.840]  getting like 700 G's a year
[02:03:15.840 --> 02:03:17.840]  yeah that's not uncommon and
[02:03:17.840 --> 02:03:19.840]  what's going on in places like Stockton or
[02:03:19.840 --> 02:03:21.840]  North Las Vegas where 67% of their budget
[02:03:21.840 --> 02:03:23.840]  is on so-called public safety
[02:03:23.840 --> 02:03:25.840]  and public security you have these
[02:03:25.840 --> 02:03:27.840]  unionized police forces
[02:03:27.840 --> 02:03:29.840]  well that's it I mean we're being held
[02:03:29.840 --> 02:03:31.840]  hostage by the security bureaucracy
[02:03:31.840 --> 02:03:33.840]  that happens in every other third world
[02:03:33.840 --> 02:03:35.840]  country yeah and they're going to kill
[02:03:35.840 --> 02:03:37.840]  the golden goose if this doesn't
[02:03:37.840 --> 02:03:39.840]  get reversed yeah and it's
[02:03:39.840 --> 02:03:41.840]  there's getting to be some pushback
[02:03:41.840 --> 02:03:43.840]  which is why I think we're hearing discussion
[02:03:43.840 --> 02:03:45.840]  of the idea of
[02:03:45.840 --> 02:03:47.840]  full spectrum operations of the homeland
[02:03:47.840 --> 02:03:49.840]  and this scenario is sketched out in the small
[02:03:49.840 --> 02:03:51.840]  wars journal talks about a small
[02:03:51.840 --> 02:03:53.840]  town in South Carolina becoming an American
[02:03:53.840 --> 02:03:55.840]  Fallujah where you'd have to have
[02:03:55.840 --> 02:03:57.840]  the Department of Homeland Security and the
[02:03:57.840 --> 02:03:59.840]  Pentagon essentially
[02:03:59.840 --> 02:04:01.840]  turn the town into a free fire
[02:04:01.840 --> 02:04:03.840]  zone if people don't submit
[02:04:03.840 --> 02:04:05.840]  to what this document calls
[02:04:05.840 --> 02:04:07.840]  the constitutional legitimacy of the federal
[02:04:07.840 --> 02:04:09.840]  government and that once again assumes
[02:04:09.840 --> 02:04:11.840]  that the government is somehow the source
[02:04:11.840 --> 02:04:13.840]  of its own legitimacy alright William let me
[02:04:13.840 --> 02:04:15.840]  stop you I hadn't read the whole document I saw
[02:04:15.840 --> 02:04:17.840]  it a few weeks ago I think because you'd written about it
[02:04:17.840 --> 02:04:19.840]  excuse me I mean
[02:04:19.840 --> 02:04:21.840]  you're a respected journalist in the American
[02:04:21.840 --> 02:04:23.840]  magazine for I don't know decades
[02:04:23.840 --> 02:04:25.840]  I hadn't read that you're saying
[02:04:25.840 --> 02:04:27.840]  that full spectrum dominance

[02:08:39.840 --> 02:08:41.840]  new army documents are put out public
[02:08:41.840 --> 02:08:43.840]  on the army's own website
[02:08:43.840 --> 02:08:45.840]  reeducation camps for the American people
[02:08:45.840 --> 02:08:47.840]  national gun confiscation drills
[02:08:47.840 --> 02:08:49.840]  demonization
[02:08:49.840 --> 02:08:51.840]  on the founding fathers, veterans
[02:08:51.840 --> 02:08:53.840]  they teach the military this now
[02:08:53.840 --> 02:08:55.840]  just incredible trees
[02:08:55.840 --> 02:08:57.840]  and now that foreign banks have bragged
[02:08:57.840 --> 02:08:59.840]  on national television
[02:08:59.840 --> 02:09:01.840]  and in print that they've captured us
[02:09:01.840 --> 02:09:03.840]  and are now going to mop up the freedoms we had
[02:09:03.840 --> 02:09:05.840]  private property all of it
[02:09:05.840 --> 02:09:07.840]  it's gone if they have their way
[02:09:07.840 --> 02:09:09.840]  and we were about to let Will Gregg
[02:09:09.840 --> 02:09:11.840]  go and he started bringing up this full
[02:09:11.840 --> 02:09:13.840]  spectrum dominance in the homeland
[02:09:13.840 --> 02:09:15.840]  Pentagon document that we found
[02:09:15.840 --> 02:09:17.840]  and I found
[02:09:17.840 --> 02:09:19.840]  sites that write about the Pentagon
[02:09:19.840 --> 02:09:21.840]  and we'll put one of them up here small wars
[02:09:21.840 --> 02:09:23.840]  the journal has quotes out of the full
[02:09:23.840 --> 02:09:25.840]  compendium
[02:09:25.840 --> 02:09:27.840]  where it talks about
[02:09:27.840 --> 02:09:29.840]  areas of South Carolina
[02:09:29.840 --> 02:09:31.840]  and we're going to go over this and it says
[02:09:31.840 --> 02:09:33.840]  a tea party group
[02:09:33.840 --> 02:09:35.840]  takes over the town
[02:09:35.840 --> 02:09:37.840]  so the military takes over radio, tv, water
[02:09:37.840 --> 02:09:39.840]  and energy I've told you they'll always do that
[02:09:39.840 --> 02:09:41.840]  they turn that off till the town submits
[02:09:41.840 --> 02:09:43.840]  and they call it reinstalling
[02:09:43.840 --> 02:09:45.840]  the elected government they mean those that are engaged
[02:09:45.840 --> 02:09:47.840]  in election fraud and this is what the
[02:09:47.840 --> 02:09:49.840]  John Warren defense authorization act dealt with
[02:09:49.840 --> 02:09:51.840]  was taking over legislatures
[02:09:51.840 --> 02:09:53.840]  remember what they said last year when Texas
[02:09:53.840 --> 02:09:55.840]  unanimously in the house said
[02:09:55.840 --> 02:09:57.840]  no more groping, no more grabbing
[02:09:57.840 --> 02:09:59.840]  our genitals inside the pants
[02:09:59.840 --> 02:10:01.840]  we're going to enforce existing laws
[02:10:01.840 --> 02:10:03.840]  the feds said we're preparing an F-16
[02:10:03.840 --> 02:10:05.840]  air embargo
[02:10:05.840 --> 02:10:07.840]  no aircraft will be allowed to enter the state or take off
[02:10:07.840 --> 02:10:09.840]  house at F-16 enforce that
[02:10:09.840 --> 02:10:11.840]  they're going to blow them out of the sky
[02:10:11.840 --> 02:10:13.840]  and we had troops on the show in Oklahoma
[02:10:13.840 --> 02:10:15.840]  and other states confirmed it
[02:10:15.840 --> 02:10:17.840]  they were getting ready to put the tanks on
[02:10:17.840 --> 02:10:19.840]  F-16s to invade
[02:10:19.840 --> 02:10:21.840]  Austin
[02:10:21.840 --> 02:10:23.840]  they were going to roll down Mopac
[02:10:23.840 --> 02:10:25.840]  the big
[02:10:25.840 --> 02:10:27.840]  big
[02:10:27.840 --> 02:10:29.840]  railroad right out of Oklahoma
[02:10:29.840 --> 02:10:31.840]  right into Austin right to the capitol
[02:10:31.840 --> 02:10:33.840]  with tanks and that was on the news too
[02:10:33.840 --> 02:10:35.840]  that they were going to blow airliners out of the air with F-16s
[02:10:35.840 --> 02:10:37.840]  with sidewinders
[02:10:37.840 --> 02:10:39.840]  aim nines and if you don't
[02:10:39.840 --> 02:10:41.840]  remember that look it up I'm not joking
[02:10:41.840 --> 02:10:43.840]  about that they said we will have a military embargo
[02:10:43.840 --> 02:10:45.840]  of Texas so this is the plan
[02:10:45.840 --> 02:10:47.840]  foreign banks have taken over
[02:10:47.840 --> 02:10:49.840]  um
[02:10:49.840 --> 02:10:51.840]  and what's incredible
[02:10:51.840 --> 02:10:53.840]  will greg is that
[02:10:53.840 --> 02:10:55.840]  the reeducation camps the gun confiscation
[02:10:55.840 --> 02:10:57.840]  the emergency centers establishment
[02:10:57.840 --> 02:10:59.840]  it's all there
[02:10:59.840 --> 02:11:01.840]  but they'll have the media simultaneously
[02:11:01.840 --> 02:11:03.840]  have the southern prairie law center ADL
[02:11:03.840 --> 02:11:05.840]  come out and say we're crazy
[02:11:05.840 --> 02:11:07.840]  there's no world government
[02:11:07.840 --> 02:11:09.840]  when I can pick up time magazine news week
[02:11:09.840 --> 02:11:11.840]  financial times the economist
[02:11:11.840 --> 02:11:13.840]  where they're announcing
[02:11:13.840 --> 02:11:15.840]  bankers took us over
[02:11:15.840 --> 02:11:17.840]  they're unelected they're installing leaders in Europe
[02:11:17.840 --> 02:11:19.840]  isn't it great that we're slaves now
[02:11:19.840 --> 02:11:21.840]  I mean I can play clips
[02:11:21.840 --> 02:11:23.840]  of the news saying we're slaves
[02:11:23.840 --> 02:11:25.840]  the world government run by banks
[02:11:25.840 --> 02:11:27.840]  and then the guest all say it's good
[02:11:27.840 --> 02:11:29.840]  I can play that right now
[02:11:29.840 --> 02:11:31.840]  but the ADL says it doesn't exist
[02:11:31.840 --> 02:11:33.840]  what's going on here
[02:11:33.840 --> 02:11:35.840]  what's going on is that they're
[02:11:35.840 --> 02:11:37.840]  pursuing sort of the Soviet
[02:11:37.840 --> 02:11:39.840]  approach of demonizing
[02:11:39.840 --> 02:11:41.840]  the people who say something rather than
[02:11:41.840 --> 02:11:43.840]  attacking what is said or showing
[02:11:43.840 --> 02:11:45.840]  the weaknesses what is said about
[02:11:45.840 --> 02:11:47.840]  an event that is documentable
[02:11:47.840 --> 02:11:49.840]  it's a question of motives and
[02:11:49.840 --> 02:11:51.840]  one's collective associations that
[02:11:51.840 --> 02:11:53.840]  is the most important
[02:11:53.840 --> 02:11:55.840]  consideration according to people like the ADL
[02:11:55.840 --> 02:11:57.840]  and the SPLC
[02:11:57.840 --> 02:11:59.840]  the line that they feed the public
[02:11:59.840 --> 02:12:01.840]  is that the conspiracy theorists are plotting
[02:12:01.840 --> 02:12:03.840]  to take over and they apparently don't understand
[02:12:03.840 --> 02:12:05.840]  the irony of that position
[02:12:05.840 --> 02:12:07.840]  but with respect to this particular document
[02:12:07.840 --> 02:12:09.840]  we're talking about here what they're describing
[02:12:09.840 --> 02:12:11.840]  is a full spectrum military operation
[02:12:11.840 --> 02:12:13.840]  targeting Darlin and South Carolina
[02:12:13.840 --> 02:12:15.840]  the scenario they paint is that in 2016
[02:12:15.840 --> 02:12:17.840]  the depression is deep and people are getting
[02:12:17.840 --> 02:12:19.840]  restive there is a so-called
[02:12:19.840 --> 02:12:21.840]  civic insurrection that replaces the government
[02:12:21.840 --> 02:12:23.840]  of this town in South Carolina
[02:12:23.840 --> 02:12:25.840]  which is considered to be a strategically critical
[02:12:25.840 --> 02:12:27.840]  choke point because it stands upward
[02:12:27.840 --> 02:12:29.840]  an important
[02:12:29.840 --> 02:12:31.840]  east to west
[02:12:31.840 --> 02:12:33.840]  they're running across the United States I think at 595
[02:12:33.840 --> 02:12:35.840]  so on the basis of the
[02:12:35.840 --> 02:12:37.840]  strategic significance
[02:12:37.840 --> 02:12:39.840]  of this city within the battle zone
[02:12:39.840 --> 02:12:41.840]  that is the United States
[02:12:41.840 --> 02:12:43.840]  there has to be a coordinated effort involving
[02:12:43.840 --> 02:12:45.840]  the Department of Homeland Security and the Pentagon
[02:12:45.840 --> 02:12:47.840]  and federalized national guard troops
[02:12:47.840 --> 02:12:49.840]  to go in and put down this
[02:12:49.840 --> 02:12:51.840]  insurrection their objective
[02:12:51.840 --> 02:12:53.840]  is to do this by overawing
[02:12:53.840 --> 02:12:55.840]  people by this conspicuous
[02:12:55.840 --> 02:12:57.840]  display of force sort of the same thing that
[02:12:57.840 --> 02:12:59.840]  happened with the whiskey rebellion in the early years of the Republic
[02:12:59.840 --> 02:13:01.840]  but the fact that they're calling this
[02:13:01.840 --> 02:13:03.840]  full spectrum dominance
[02:13:03.840 --> 02:13:05.840]  and in light of what is said in the other documents
[02:13:05.840 --> 02:13:07.840]  that we have read regarding
[02:13:07.840 --> 02:13:09.840]  the way that military operations are conducted
[02:13:09.840 --> 02:13:11.840]  in the environments other than war operations other than war
[02:13:11.840 --> 02:13:13.840]  it's pretty clear that what you're talking
[02:13:13.840 --> 02:13:15.840]  about is that behind
[02:13:15.840 --> 02:13:17.840]  this display of force would be the
[02:13:17.840 --> 02:13:19.840]  exercise of real force
[02:13:19.840 --> 02:13:21.840]  to dispatch people who are
[02:13:21.840 --> 02:13:23.840]  considered to be ineducable
[02:13:23.840 --> 02:13:25.840]  people who are not sufficiently intimidated
[02:13:25.840 --> 02:13:27.840]  by the display of force would be
[02:13:27.840 --> 02:13:29.840]  dealt with as severely perhaps as we saw
[02:13:29.840 --> 02:13:31.840]  in pollution when they simply turned that town
[02:13:31.840 --> 02:13:33.840]  into a free fire zone
[02:13:33.840 --> 02:13:35.840]  they were doing drills for
[02:13:35.840 --> 02:13:37.840]  I've been to countless urban warfare drills
[02:13:37.840 --> 02:13:39.840]  where they admit they're practicing taking on
[02:13:39.840 --> 02:13:41.840]  quote the militia
[02:13:41.840 --> 02:13:43.840]  and we've got all these army training manuals
[02:13:43.840 --> 02:13:45.840]  and the point is this has been on the books a while
[02:13:45.840 --> 02:13:47.840]  but they're gearing up
[02:13:47.840 --> 02:13:49.840]  they're massively increasing funding
[02:13:49.840 --> 02:13:51.840]  they're massively increasing the drills
[02:13:51.840 --> 02:13:53.840]  and I just can't believe
[02:13:53.840 --> 02:13:55.840]  it's actually coming
[02:13:55.840 --> 02:13:57.840]  to this
[02:13:57.840 --> 02:13:59.840]  have you seen all the news articles
[02:13:59.840 --> 02:14:01.840]  and all the TV shows where they're bragging
[02:14:01.840 --> 02:14:03.840]  captured by foreign bankers
[02:14:03.840 --> 02:14:05.840]  I've seen some shows that convey that message
[02:14:05.840 --> 02:14:07.840]  and there's very little effort to disguise
[02:14:07.840 --> 02:14:09.840]  what's going on and it should be obvious
[02:14:09.840 --> 02:14:11.840]  anybody with even a passing acquaintance
[02:14:11.840 --> 02:14:13.840]  with the connections of people
[02:14:13.840 --> 02:14:15.840]  like Timothy Geithner and Paulson
[02:14:15.840 --> 02:14:17.840]  and the rest of the people who were
[02:14:17.840 --> 02:14:19.840]  involved in the October
[02:14:19.840 --> 02:14:21.840]  Revolution of 2008 when
[02:14:21.840 --> 02:14:23.840]  the entire
[02:14:23.840 --> 02:14:25.840]  United States economy was turned over
[02:14:25.840 --> 02:14:27.840]  lock stock and barrel to the
[02:14:27.840 --> 02:14:29.840]  investment banking community as a thousand
[02:14:29.840 --> 02:14:31.840]  that's pretty obvious that's what's happened
[02:14:31.840 --> 02:14:33.840]  and of course you may mention the fact that
[02:14:33.840 --> 02:14:35.840]  you've got the international
[02:14:35.840 --> 02:14:37.840]  banking community as it styles itself once again
[02:14:37.840 --> 02:14:39.840]  appointing
[02:14:39.840 --> 02:14:41.840]  political officials
[02:14:41.840 --> 02:14:43.840]  in the European governments
[02:14:43.840 --> 02:14:45.840]  governments throughout the year zone
[02:14:45.840 --> 02:14:47.840]  and you have towns of this country that are being
[02:14:47.840 --> 02:14:49.840]  brought into a similar relationship with the banking
[02:14:49.840 --> 02:14:51.840]  interest here in this country
[02:14:51.840 --> 02:14:53.840]  and it stands to reason that some place
[02:14:53.840 --> 02:14:55.840]  like a darling in South Carolina
[02:14:55.840 --> 02:14:57.840]  or some other bankrupt municipality
[02:14:57.840 --> 02:14:59.840]  surprised the type
[02:14:59.840 --> 02:15:01.840]  of healthy insurrection that's described
[02:15:01.840 --> 02:15:03.840]  in this article and the approach
[02:15:03.840 --> 02:15:05.840]  of the Pentagon would be to stuff it out
[02:15:05.840 --> 02:15:07.840]  to stuff it out using whatever
[02:15:07.840 --> 02:15:09.840]  means would be necessary and toward
[02:15:09.840 --> 02:15:11.840]  the end of this document there's a perfectly deranged line
[02:15:11.840 --> 02:15:13.840]  here that is really I think a poker
[02:15:13.840 --> 02:15:15.840]  tell. We cannot discount
[02:15:15.840 --> 02:15:17.840]  the agility of an external threat
[02:15:17.840 --> 02:15:19.840]  the evolution of Al-Qaeda for example
[02:15:19.840 --> 02:15:21.840]  and its ability to take advantage
[02:15:21.840 --> 02:15:23.840]  of a Darlington event within U.S. borders
[02:15:23.840 --> 02:15:25.840]  well there it is
[02:15:25.840 --> 02:15:27.840]  the militias would be the natural
[02:15:27.840 --> 02:15:29.840]  handmaidens of Al-Qaeda whatever that title
[02:15:29.840 --> 02:15:31.840]  yeah let's stop right there I've seen them
[02:15:31.840 --> 02:15:33.840]  pushing this and that's what I've said
[02:15:33.840 --> 02:15:35.840]  and boy you just here's another document
[02:15:35.840 --> 02:15:37.840]  saying it the militia
[02:15:37.840 --> 02:15:39.840]  the anti-New World Order folks
[02:15:39.840 --> 02:15:41.840]  who pretty much disappeared
[02:15:41.840 --> 02:15:43.840]  after 9-11 because you know they
[02:15:43.840 --> 02:15:45.840]  you know they hate quote Islam so much
[02:15:45.840 --> 02:15:47.840]  many of them this is
[02:15:47.840 --> 02:15:49.840]  so insane
[02:15:49.840 --> 02:15:51.840]  and just a complete
[02:15:51.840 --> 02:15:53.840]  and total joke
[02:15:53.840 --> 02:15:55.840]  to say that Al-Qaeda would link up
[02:15:55.840 --> 02:15:57.840]  with militias I mean imagine how
[02:15:57.840 --> 02:15:59.840]  gun owning libertarian conservatives
[02:15:59.840 --> 02:16:01.840]  are going to work with Al-Qaeda
[02:16:01.840 --> 02:16:03.840]  meanwhile our own military
[02:16:03.840 --> 02:16:05.840]  brought in to Libya out of
[02:16:05.840 --> 02:16:07.840]  Egypt but also
[02:16:07.840 --> 02:16:09.840]  out of the Mediterranean
[02:16:09.840 --> 02:16:11.840]  landing them in Tripoli
[02:16:11.840 --> 02:16:13.840]  tens of thousands of real Al-Qaeda
[02:16:13.840 --> 02:16:15.840]  who are now exporting
[02:16:15.840 --> 02:16:17.840]  high-tech weapons out of Libya they captured
[02:16:17.840 --> 02:16:19.840]  into Syria
[02:16:19.840 --> 02:16:21.840]  and our own criminal government
[02:16:21.840 --> 02:16:23.840]  how do they do that because there's now
[02:16:23.840 --> 02:16:25.840]  even articles I saw another
[02:16:25.840 --> 02:16:27.840]  one today I mean there's mainstream
[02:16:27.840 --> 02:16:29.840]  articles praising Al-Qaeda
[02:16:29.840 --> 02:16:31.840]  and what a great job they're doing in Syria
[02:16:31.840 --> 02:16:33.840]  I mean this is like an Alice
[02:16:33.840 --> 02:16:35.840]  in Wonderland thing where
[02:16:35.840 --> 02:16:37.840]  the conservative patriots are going to join Al-Qaeda
[02:16:37.840 --> 02:16:39.840]  but Al-Qaeda is good
[02:16:39.840 --> 02:16:41.840]  and works with NATO
[02:16:41.840 --> 02:16:43.840]  there was a
[02:16:43.840 --> 02:16:45.840]  Saturday or Sunday night rather on NBC
[02:16:45.840 --> 02:16:47.840]  just before the Olympics where
[02:16:47.840 --> 02:16:49.840]  I think it was Bob Engel was on the ground
[02:16:49.840 --> 02:16:51.840]  a supposed freedom of fighting group
[02:16:51.840 --> 02:16:53.840]  there in Syria in which
[02:16:53.840 --> 02:16:55.840]  their leadership said either give us arms
[02:16:55.840 --> 02:16:57.840]  or we're going to turn to Al-Qaeda for help
[02:16:57.840 --> 02:16:59.840]  I mean it was overt, undisguised, unbarnished
[02:16:59.840 --> 02:17:01.840]  war propaganda meant to
[02:17:01.840 --> 02:17:03.840]  people the idea that
[02:17:03.840 --> 02:17:05.840]  unless we provide these people with money and arms
[02:17:05.840 --> 02:17:07.840]  then they're going to turn to Al-Qaeda
[02:17:07.840 --> 02:17:09.840]  well that's the same thing we've got to grow the opium
[02:17:09.840 --> 02:17:11.840]  and ship it to America and have the troops
[02:17:11.840 --> 02:17:13.840]  grow it in front of you or Al-Qaeda
[02:17:13.840 --> 02:17:15.840]  will grow it I mean it's ridiculous
[02:17:15.840 --> 02:17:17.840]  sure and of course the entire purpose of
[02:17:17.840 --> 02:17:19.840]  this type of thing is to
[02:17:19.840 --> 02:17:21.840]  create in the public mind this idea
[02:17:21.840 --> 02:17:23.840]  that all these supposed threats and enemies
[02:17:23.840 --> 02:17:25.840]  are compounded into one
[02:17:25.840 --> 02:17:27.840]  if you hear somebody talking about
[02:17:27.840 --> 02:17:29.840]  the dangers of what the banking
[02:17:29.840 --> 02:17:31.840]  community that the banking interests are doing
[02:17:31.840 --> 02:17:33.840]  in our country and talking about
[02:17:33.840 --> 02:17:35.840]  the dangers of impending martial law that at some point
[02:17:35.840 --> 02:17:37.840]  for those who consume
[02:17:37.840 --> 02:17:39.840]  uncritically what they're fed by the government
[02:17:39.840 --> 02:17:41.840]  of live media that say well this sounds
[02:17:41.840 --> 02:17:43.840]  like the sort of radical stuff that these
[02:17:43.840 --> 02:17:45.840]  bearded savages overseas are saying
[02:17:45.840 --> 02:17:47.840]  and so there'd be
[02:17:47.840 --> 02:17:49.840]  I think at least on the part of some
[02:17:49.840 --> 02:17:51.840]  segment of the public a receptivity of the idea
[02:17:51.840 --> 02:17:53.840]  that the government has to do these horrible
[02:17:53.840 --> 02:17:55.840]  things in order to deal with insurrectionaries
[02:17:55.840 --> 02:17:57.840]  in Darlington, South Carolina or any
[02:17:57.840 --> 02:17:59.840]  place else in the country. The sort of
[02:17:59.840 --> 02:18:01.840]  thing that happened almost 20 years ago
[02:18:01.840 --> 02:18:03.840]  with respect to the branch of the committee is about
[02:18:03.840 --> 02:18:05.840]  Carmel. The public was fed
[02:18:05.840 --> 02:18:07.840]  an incessant stream of dehumanizing propaganda
[02:18:07.840 --> 02:18:09.840]  investing data correctionist
[02:18:09.840 --> 02:18:11.840]  followers with every manner of ugliness
[02:18:11.840 --> 02:18:13.840]  and viciousness and so
[02:18:13.840 --> 02:18:15.840]  when they were immolated by the federal
[02:18:15.840 --> 02:18:17.840]  government on day 51
[02:18:17.840 --> 02:18:19.840]  of that feed, their reaction was
[02:18:19.840 --> 02:18:21.840]  on the part of people saying they deserved it.
[02:18:21.840 --> 02:18:23.840]  They had it coming to their evil
[02:18:23.840 --> 02:18:25.840]  sexually deranged cult and people
[02:18:25.840 --> 02:18:27.840]  tend to be malleable. By the way
[02:18:27.840 --> 02:18:29.840]  you just mentioned that
[02:18:29.840 --> 02:18:31.840]  Pentagon document. They had it on screen while
[02:18:31.840 --> 02:18:33.840]  you were just talking and I was reading it.
[02:18:33.840 --> 02:18:35.840]  It talks about checkpoints
[02:18:35.840 --> 02:18:37.840]  not letting the food and water into Darlington
[02:18:37.840 --> 02:18:39.840]  South Carolina and then having
[02:18:39.840 --> 02:18:41.840]  the people exfiltrate out
[02:18:41.840 --> 02:18:43.840]  I mean this is martial law. This is
[02:18:43.840 --> 02:18:45.840]  what I've seen the military train
[02:18:45.840 --> 02:18:47.840]  for in the gun confiscation manuals.
[02:18:47.840 --> 02:18:49.840]  It says they're going to lock down
[02:18:49.840 --> 02:18:51.840]  and barricade cities. Our
[02:18:51.840 --> 02:18:53.840]  government has been taken over by foreign
[02:18:53.840 --> 02:18:55.840]  banks. The military is being
[02:18:55.840 --> 02:18:57.840]  trained to be collaborators with this.
[02:18:57.840 --> 02:18:59.840]  It's that simple and
[02:18:59.840 --> 02:19:01.840]  people they're going to create a climate
[02:19:01.840 --> 02:19:03.840]  where they're going to force us to resist.
[02:19:03.840 --> 02:19:05.840]  That's why they're training for this.
[02:19:05.840 --> 02:19:07.840]  It is the total takeover of our society.
[02:19:07.840 --> 02:19:09.840]  Well, Will Greg, I've always been
[02:19:09.840 --> 02:19:11.840]  impressed with your films. I've been impressed
[02:19:11.840 --> 02:19:13.840]  with your writing. I don't know why I never got
[02:19:13.840 --> 02:19:15.840]  shown the show until now.
[02:19:15.840 --> 02:19:17.840]  I mean maybe over 17 years I might have talked
[02:19:17.840 --> 02:19:19.840]  to you once. Have I ever interviewed you before?
[02:19:19.840 --> 02:19:21.840]  No, I think this is my first time and I appreciate it, Alex.
[02:19:21.840 --> 02:19:23.840]  I've talked to Will Jasper and others.
[02:19:23.840 --> 02:19:25.840]  Well, great job. We need to get Mr.
[02:19:25.840 --> 02:19:27.840]  McManus back on the show as well.
[02:19:27.840 --> 02:19:29.840]  You said Bob Desi in here a few weeks ago.
[02:19:29.840 --> 02:19:31.840]  Thank you so much for your tireless work.
[02:19:31.840 --> 02:19:33.840]  You guys really are the proto tea party.
[02:19:33.840 --> 02:19:35.840]  You help wake me up
[02:19:35.840 --> 02:19:37.840]  and then I've helped wake up millions
[02:19:37.840 --> 02:19:39.840]  and just God bless you.
[02:19:39.840 --> 02:19:41.840]  And thanks for all the time.
[02:19:41.840 --> 02:19:43.840]  Thank you so much, Alex. God bless you.
[02:19:43.840 --> 02:19:45.840]  All right, goodbye. There goes Will Greg.
[02:19:45.840 --> 02:19:47.840]  I'm going to come back, go to your calls, John,
[02:19:47.840 --> 02:19:49.840]  and then Mike and then Alex,
[02:19:49.840 --> 02:19:51.840]  Mary Ann, Ron, we'll get to those five,
[02:19:51.840 --> 02:19:53.840]  six calls and then it's a news blitz.
[02:19:53.840 --> 02:19:55.840]  Believe me, you don't want to miss
[02:19:55.840 --> 02:19:57.840]  any of this key intel coming up.
[02:19:57.840 --> 02:20:07.840]  I'm Alex Jones, Defender of Freedom.
[02:20:27.840 --> 02:20:37.840]  I'm Alex Jones, Defender of Freedom.
[02:20:57.840 --> 02:21:00.840]  You can bet your life on e-foods direct.

[02:22:00.840 --> 02:22:02.840]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger,
[02:22:02.840 --> 02:22:05.840]  author of the best-selling book Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[02:22:05.840 --> 02:22:08.840]  I want you to know some very important information.
[02:22:08.840 --> 02:22:11.840]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested
[02:22:11.840 --> 02:22:13.840]  that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House
[02:22:13.840 --> 02:22:15.840]  at a time when only the president
[02:22:15.840 --> 02:22:17.840]  could obtain this world-class healer.
[02:22:17.840 --> 02:22:20.840]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules
[02:22:20.840 --> 02:22:22.840]  are used around the world to keep people healthy.

[02:22:28.840 --> 02:22:31.840]  that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only
[02:22:31.840 --> 02:22:33.840]  without harming a single normal cell.
[02:22:33.840 --> 02:22:35.840]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance

[02:22:45.840 --> 02:22:49.840]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A.com.
[02:22:49.840 --> 02:22:52.840]  That's 1-866-836-8735.
[02:22:52.840 --> 02:22:56.840]  1-866-VENUS-FLY or visit Carnivora.com.

[02:24:26.840 --> 02:24:29.840]  Look, it's happened in every other country and every other society,
[02:24:29.840 --> 02:24:33.840]  every other empire, throughout history, over and over again.
[02:24:33.840 --> 02:24:37.840]  Powerful, corrupt interests get in control
[02:24:37.840 --> 02:24:45.840]  and they take over the military and absolutely rob everyone.
[02:24:45.840 --> 02:24:52.840]  I mean, government is already inoculating your children nationwide illegally.
[02:24:52.840 --> 02:24:55.840]  They get on the news and say it's the law to take vaccines illegally.
[02:24:55.840 --> 02:24:57.840]  It's a group of criminals.
[02:24:57.840 --> 02:25:02.840]  I have a stack of health news again today.
[02:25:02.840 --> 02:25:05.840]  More big studies about how GMO corn and other things
[02:25:05.840 --> 02:25:09.840]  is totally sterilizing gerbils within three generations.
[02:25:09.840 --> 02:25:11.840]  That's why people are going sterile.
[02:25:11.840 --> 02:25:14.840]  I mean, folks, they've got to have all the drones and stuff in place.
[02:25:14.840 --> 02:25:17.840]  It's another 20 years with all the health problems we've got now
[02:25:17.840 --> 02:25:19.840]  when another generation hits fertility
[02:25:19.840 --> 02:25:22.840]  and, you know, 80% of them can't have kids.
[02:25:22.840 --> 02:25:25.840]  You're going to have some mad people.
[02:25:25.840 --> 02:25:27.840]  But it's all right. There's going to be drugs in the water.
[02:25:27.840 --> 02:25:29.840]  There already are putting them in the water.
[02:25:29.840 --> 02:25:32.840]  But there'll be public drugs in the water so you don't get upset.
[02:25:32.840 --> 02:25:35.840]  This is just that they're just killing us.
[02:25:35.840 --> 02:25:37.840]  Killing us nice and slow.
[02:25:37.840 --> 02:25:40.840]  It's all about their power trip because they're wicked
[02:25:40.840 --> 02:25:42.840]  and they hate us and they're willing to do it.
[02:25:42.840 --> 02:25:46.840]  And they see our cities and our culture as ugly and stupid
[02:25:46.840 --> 02:25:49.840]  and we play along with it and so they're killing us.
[02:25:49.840 --> 02:25:52.840]  They're killing us. All those guys sitting there running drones,
[02:25:52.840 --> 02:25:55.840]  killing people all day and feeling manly about it
[02:25:55.840 --> 02:25:59.840]  as they blow up a whole village to kill one person they claims a terrorist.
[02:25:59.840 --> 02:26:01.840]  They're all being killed too.
[02:26:01.840 --> 02:26:03.840]  And a lot of them don't care.
[02:26:03.840 --> 02:26:05.840]  They're like, yeah, I know DU's going to kill me. So what?
[02:26:05.840 --> 02:26:07.840]  I'm going to kill me some Hodges.
[02:26:07.840 --> 02:26:09.840]  You're like, but it's killing you too.
[02:26:09.840 --> 02:26:11.840]  But it's going to increase your birth defects.
[02:26:11.840 --> 02:26:13.840]  They're like, I don't care.
[02:26:13.840 --> 02:26:16.840]  I don't care if my kid's totally deformed. So what? I'm tough.
[02:26:16.840 --> 02:26:19.840]  It's really a culture of murder me, kill me, run over me.
[02:26:19.840 --> 02:26:21.840]  I want to be a slave.
[02:26:21.840 --> 02:26:23.840]  And because it's a spiritual decision with these people,
[02:26:23.840 --> 02:26:26.840]  these people at every level of society that serve the dark side,
[02:26:26.840 --> 02:26:28.840]  they like it.
[02:26:28.840 --> 02:26:31.840]  So I guess in a way it's a good thing. I mean, it's what they want.
[02:26:31.840 --> 02:26:34.840]  I saw this photo last night and it turns out it's old news.
[02:26:34.840 --> 02:26:37.840]  And when I saw it, I didn't believe it.
[02:26:37.840 --> 02:26:40.840]  I saw it posted on my Facebook and I didn't believe this photo.
[02:26:40.840 --> 02:26:43.840]  I think I'll cover it after calls.
[02:26:43.840 --> 02:26:46.840]  And it's, I had an abortion Gloria Stein.
[02:26:46.840 --> 02:26:49.840]  I'm on how wonderful abortions are. I mean, it's one thing.
[02:26:49.840 --> 02:26:52.840]  If you, you know, get an abortion, that's bad enough.
[02:26:52.840 --> 02:26:56.840]  But to act like it's fun and cool and you're in charge.
[02:26:59.840 --> 02:27:02.840]  It's just begging for the new reloaded release a bio weapon on us.
[02:27:02.840 --> 02:27:04.840]  Planned Parenthood. I had an abortion.
[02:27:04.840 --> 02:27:07.840]  I mean, what a sack of trash.
[02:27:07.840 --> 02:27:11.840]  CIA officer sworn to destroy the family.
[02:27:11.840 --> 02:27:14.840]  She admits that now and she loves what she's done to this country.
[02:27:14.840 --> 02:27:19.840]  She loves the fact that we're hunchbacked, ugly, stupid, gibbering people now.
[02:27:19.840 --> 02:27:22.840]  I mean, I mean, she just loves it.
[02:27:22.840 --> 02:27:26.840]  She loves the fact that the prisons are full, the children are in pain,
[02:27:26.840 --> 02:27:29.840]  the CPS is, I mean, God we're cursed.
[02:27:29.840 --> 02:27:33.840]  She just loves it because we're all on abortion.
[02:27:33.840 --> 02:27:35.840]  They want to abort us. You got that?
[02:27:35.840 --> 02:27:37.840]  Because they're a bunch of crocodiles.
[02:27:37.840 --> 02:27:40.840]  They're a bunch of snakes. They're a bunch of pit demons.
[02:27:40.840 --> 02:27:46.840]  Man, Gloria Steinem is a sack of demonic bill that just loves death.
[02:27:46.840 --> 02:27:48.840]  And they love that power.
[02:27:48.840 --> 02:27:54.840]  They're attracted to the fact that we're in charge and we're going to get you.
[02:27:54.840 --> 02:27:56.840]  We're going to have your 12-year-old when she gets pregnant.
[02:27:56.840 --> 02:27:59.840]  We're going to take them to Planned Parenthood without you knowing them.
[02:27:59.840 --> 02:28:04.840]  We're going to abort that baby and we're going to shoot you up with vaccines and sterilize you.
[02:28:04.840 --> 02:28:08.840]  We're going to do it because we're liberal. We're liberal.
[02:28:08.840 --> 02:28:11.840]  John in Utah, you're on the air. Welcome.
[02:28:11.840 --> 02:28:14.840]  Then I'm going to go to Mike. You're on the air, John.
[02:28:14.840 --> 02:28:21.840]  I'm going to go about my e-book on showing why the income tax is and must be voluntary.
[02:28:21.840 --> 02:28:25.840]  And it's the key and the silver bullet to getting rid of the income tax.
[02:28:25.840 --> 02:28:31.840]  But not only that, since the Obamacare decision by Judge Roberts points out
[02:28:31.840 --> 02:28:37.840]  that the mandatory part of the tax is really just in addition to the income tax,
[02:28:37.840 --> 02:28:44.840]  it is the key, once people understand that, to negating that, the Obamacare.
[02:28:44.840 --> 02:28:51.840]  But, you know, to understand this, and the reason we don't understand why the income tax is voluntary
[02:28:51.840 --> 02:28:57.840]  is because we don't understand that our tax law has to correspond to that that was in England
[02:28:57.840 --> 02:29:03.840]  at the time of the Fifth Amendment was ratified in 1791 in order to meet due process.
[02:29:03.840 --> 02:29:09.840]  And it does. And what it corresponds to is the 1040 is a voluntary contract.
[02:29:09.840 --> 02:29:15.840]  Yeah, no, it's all a total fraud to the private federal reserve. It's all a total scam.
[02:29:15.840 --> 02:29:18.840]  The problem is it doesn't matter if it's not legal and lawful.
[02:29:18.840 --> 02:29:23.840]  This is a lawless crime syndicate of hopped up control freak scum.
[02:29:23.840 --> 02:29:29.840]  So just because we've been conquered by foreign banks, the people don't know that yet.
[02:29:29.840 --> 02:29:32.840]  So we've got to somehow get the information out to them.
[02:29:32.840 --> 02:29:37.840]  But just because it is voluntary, that's why, you know, these globalists don't pay it.
[02:29:37.840 --> 02:29:44.840]  They're the only ones that are selectively not attacked by armed robbers who believe they're police officers.
[02:29:44.840 --> 02:29:49.840]  They've got armed enforcers that are ready to eat their own children's brains and ask for seconds.
[02:29:49.840 --> 02:29:53.840]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.840 --> 02:29:57.840]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:57.840 --> 02:30:02.840]  The worst drought in 50 years continues.
[02:30:02.840 --> 02:30:06.840]  And the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[02:30:06.840 --> 02:30:09.840]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[02:30:09.840 --> 02:30:15.840]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[02:30:15.840 --> 02:30:20.840]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[02:30:20.840 --> 02:30:24.840]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost to today's prices
[02:30:24.840 --> 02:30:27.840]  by getting your own supply of foods from Eat Foods Direct now.
[02:30:27.840 --> 02:30:31.840]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, Eat Foods will have to raise prices too.
[02:30:31.840 --> 02:30:33.840]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[02:30:33.840 --> 02:30:37.840]  I recently increased my supply from Eat Foods Direct because we've all known this was coming.
[02:30:37.840 --> 02:30:40.840]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.
[02:30:40.840 --> 02:30:43.840]  The fact is you can eat it anytime to save money today.
[02:30:43.840 --> 02:30:47.840]  And because it's stored for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[02:30:47.840 --> 02:30:53.840]  Don't wait. Call 800-409-5633 or go to eatfoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:30:53.840 --> 02:30:58.840]  Call 800-409-5633 or eatfoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.

[02:31:02.840 --> 02:31:10.840]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cow Bend Soap Company.
[02:31:10.840 --> 02:31:14.840]  Alex and his staff have used these pure soap products for years.
[02:31:14.840 --> 02:31:21.840]  These all-natural soaps are made from the highest quality vegetable and coconut oils that are earth-friendly and safe.

[02:31:35.840 --> 02:31:40.840]  Or save big with a one to two-year supply of soaps for all your cleaning needs.
[02:31:40.840 --> 02:31:42.840]  This is an amazing deal.
[02:31:42.840 --> 02:31:47.840]  You can save thousands of dollars and you will love the way real soap makes you feel.
[02:31:47.840 --> 02:31:56.840]  See them on the web at 5starsoap.com or call 800-340-7091 for a free catalog.
[02:32:17.840 --> 02:32:20.840]  Its filters are silver and pregnant to prevent bacterial growth.
[02:32:20.840 --> 02:32:22.840]  There's no priming required.
[02:32:22.840 --> 02:32:24.840]  It's NSF-42 certified.
[02:32:24.840 --> 02:32:28.840]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[02:32:28.840 --> 02:32:29.840]  Easy to set up and use.
[02:32:29.840 --> 02:32:31.840]  Doesn't require electricity.
[02:32:31.840 --> 02:32:34.840]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds and wells.
[02:32:34.840 --> 02:32:37.840]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[02:32:37.840 --> 02:32:41.840]  Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[02:32:41.840 --> 02:32:44.840]  Pro Pure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[02:32:44.840 --> 02:32:49.840]  It's what my family uses. Infowars.com already has the lowest price on Pro Pure.
[02:32:49.840 --> 02:32:55.840]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at Infowars.com.
[02:32:55.840 --> 02:33:00.840]  You can also call to order 888-253-3139.
[02:33:00.840 --> 02:33:10.840]  Music
[02:33:10.840 --> 02:33:15.840]  He aligns himself with the truth that it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:33:15.840 --> 02:33:18.840]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:33:18.840 --> 02:33:28.840]  Music
[02:33:28.840 --> 02:33:32.840]  I don't know if new listeners think I'm playing games or joking around.
[02:33:32.840 --> 02:33:36.840]  Music
[02:33:36.840 --> 02:33:40.840]  Yeah, the death machine isn't slowing down. It's gaining pound for pound.
[02:33:40.840 --> 02:33:42.840]  Music
[02:33:42.840 --> 02:33:51.840]  Somehow people think that the military and all these systems of death give us individually power.
[02:33:51.840 --> 02:33:53.840]  It doesn't. It gives us insecurity.
[02:33:53.840 --> 02:34:02.840]  In the Romans, 2,000 years ago, you didn't let the military inside the country of Italy didn't even exist.
[02:34:02.840 --> 02:34:14.840]  It was a province of the city-state of Rome, and they couldn't bring the troops in past the Rubicon River in Tuscany up in the north.
[02:34:14.840 --> 02:34:21.840]  You could not bring them in to the province of Italy out of Austria and out of what is Switzerland today.
[02:34:21.840 --> 02:34:24.840]  They had different names then.
[02:34:24.840 --> 02:34:32.840]  And folks, we're going to get hurt bad.
[02:34:32.840 --> 02:34:42.840]  It's just like last week, Harvard came out and said we've reviewed more than a dozen top scientific U.S. government university studies on fluoride,
[02:34:42.840 --> 02:34:50.840]  and it does increase cancer sevenfold in men in just one type, three score in women, and it does cause massive brain damage.
[02:34:50.840 --> 02:34:52.840]  Yeah, that's why they put it in the water.
[02:34:52.840 --> 02:34:54.840]  And again, I'll just go back to that.
[02:34:54.840 --> 02:34:58.840]  This is so far beyond arguments with people, okay?
[02:34:58.840 --> 02:35:02.840]  I'm not apologizing here for telling you the truth.
[02:35:02.840 --> 02:35:05.840]  We got some sick freaks in control.
[02:35:05.840 --> 02:35:15.840]  And the minute they got a national security state in 47, after they brought more than 100,000 Nazis, top Nazis over here,
[02:35:15.840 --> 02:35:24.840]  and they didn't just get their knowledge of science, they put them in charge of everything at a director level.
[02:35:24.840 --> 02:35:27.840]  And again, this isn't some obsession with Nazis.
[02:35:27.840 --> 02:35:34.840]  That's just the people running things here were already so evil because they taught the Nazis everything they knew.
[02:35:34.840 --> 02:35:36.840]  They hired them to run.
[02:35:36.840 --> 02:35:37.840]  I mean, we're in a lot.
[02:35:37.840 --> 02:35:47.840]  It's kind of like Homeland Security ten years ago hired Marcus Wolf, the former head of the Stasi, to help set up modern Homeland Security and the Tattletale squads.
[02:35:47.840 --> 02:35:52.840]  And the first time I heard that, it was Al Martin wrote about it.
[02:35:52.840 --> 02:35:55.840]  And he's a good writer, so I thought, well, I better look into that.
[02:35:55.840 --> 02:36:05.840]  And I went and found what he was talking about in the legislation where they were paying that guy a million bucks a year, like a million two or something.
[02:36:05.840 --> 02:36:10.840]  But when I read it, when I confirmed it, I was like, that was ten years ago.
[02:36:10.840 --> 02:36:13.840]  I like hired the former head of the Stasi.
[02:36:13.840 --> 02:36:15.840]  But look what they're building.
[02:36:15.840 --> 02:36:17.840]  They're building an East German model.
[02:36:17.840 --> 02:36:21.840]  I mean, they're not doing this because they want to play tiddlywinks.
[02:36:21.840 --> 02:36:24.840]  And so many people I know are like, oh, Obama's horrible.
[02:36:24.840 --> 02:36:26.840]  He's a communist and all this stuff.
[02:36:26.840 --> 02:36:29.840]  Yeah, he's a communist at a certain level, but he's a globalist.
[02:36:29.840 --> 02:36:32.840]  And everybody wants to blame Obama, which fine, blame Obama.
[02:36:32.840 --> 02:36:35.840]  Obama's horrible.
[02:36:35.840 --> 02:36:43.840]  In fact, there's a story up at the Drudge Report where Jay Carney has come out and attacked Drudge and said,
[02:36:43.840 --> 02:36:53.840]  consider the source on Drudge saying, portray us as being considered.
[02:36:53.840 --> 02:36:56.840]  And I just thought about the fact, consider the source.
[02:36:56.840 --> 02:36:58.840]  Yeah, consider the source with you.
[02:36:58.840 --> 02:37:05.840]  Drudge is the one that exposed the whole Monica Lewinsky thing and so many other things that Bill Clinton said wasn't true.
[02:37:05.840 --> 02:37:08.840]  Consider the source here, people that ship guns into Mexico,
[02:37:08.840 --> 02:37:12.840]  that give billions of dollars to different energy companies to never build anything.
[02:37:12.840 --> 02:37:17.840]  That it's now come out in internal emails and congressional investigation
[02:37:17.840 --> 02:37:25.840]  that Geithner sought to shut down and take pensions of non-union workers at companies.
[02:37:25.840 --> 02:37:29.840]  And it's not because they care about union workers.
[02:37:29.840 --> 02:37:34.840]  They want to shut this country down.
[02:37:34.840 --> 02:37:40.840]  Geithner Treasury drove cutoff of non-union Delphi workers' pensions.
[02:37:40.840 --> 02:37:44.840]  And these people worked there 20 years and they just took their pension funds.
[02:37:44.840 --> 02:37:50.840]  I mean, these are criminals and they want your guns because they know you're going to get so mad
[02:37:50.840 --> 02:37:54.840]  with what they're planning to do soon that you're going to get angry.
[02:37:54.840 --> 02:37:58.840]  They know they're going to make you so desperate that you're going to go after them
[02:37:58.840 --> 02:38:01.840]  and they don't want you armed to be able to defend yourself.
[02:38:01.840 --> 02:38:07.840]  And so they're training all these poor people who have no future to join the military and the police
[02:38:07.840 --> 02:38:13.840]  to have a big war with us and they don't care that the police and military are going to get shot up in this fight.
[02:38:13.840 --> 02:38:16.840]  Let me tell you something though, the Pentagon with all its drones,
[02:38:16.840 --> 02:38:21.840]  they had what, 3,000 of them deployed over Iraq alone, tied to that.
[02:38:21.840 --> 02:38:26.840]  The Air Force alone is like 20,000 plus drones they admit to having,
[02:38:26.840 --> 02:38:30.840]  just 12,000 of the predator.
[02:38:30.840 --> 02:38:33.840]  They couldn't even hold Baghdad.
[02:38:33.840 --> 02:38:36.840]  Let me give everybody a news flash here.
[02:38:36.840 --> 02:38:39.840]  And let me tell the New World Order and the FBI and all of you something.
[02:38:39.840 --> 02:38:44.840]  Just because you go out and create fake militia groups and mix them in with white supremacists to demonize militias,
[02:38:44.840 --> 02:38:48.840]  and just because you do these mass shootings and all this other stuff you stage,
[02:38:48.840 --> 02:38:53.840]  you have not met the American people yet, okay?
[02:38:53.840 --> 02:38:57.840]  And if you think we're going to wait in our houses once you start this criminal takeover
[02:38:57.840 --> 02:39:03.840]  for you to send a drone by to burn us out, this isn't going to be like Waco.
[02:39:03.840 --> 02:39:08.840]  Now, I want to stop this and I know a lot of people in government want to stop it as well,
[02:39:08.840 --> 02:39:17.840]  but I need the American people to get angry and say no to this corrupt system.
[02:39:17.840 --> 02:39:21.840]  And I see this being played like a fiddle.
[02:39:21.840 --> 02:39:28.840]  The abject hatred of Obama and then the point of, well, let's just get Mitt Romney in there and he'll save us.
[02:39:28.840 --> 02:39:33.840]  Mitt Romney won't even fight back against Obama on the subject of fast and furious.
[02:39:33.840 --> 02:39:39.840]  Mitt Romney is literally paid for by the same people.
[02:39:39.840 --> 02:39:41.840]  Now, granted, he doesn't have a communist background.
[02:39:41.840 --> 02:39:47.840]  Granted, he isn't a mafia thug at the street level like the Chicago mafia.
[02:39:47.840 --> 02:39:52.840]  And he's got white gloves on, so maybe he'd be more dainty.
[02:39:52.840 --> 02:39:57.840]  But the globalists are getting what they want out of Obama.
[02:39:57.840 --> 02:40:05.840]  So regardless of who Mitt Romney is, does it matter if he wears white gloves when we're the main serving at dinner?
[02:40:05.840 --> 02:40:13.840]  And Obama's people aren't wearing white gloves because, I mean, I said I'd go to your calls.
[02:40:13.840 --> 02:40:15.840]  Ron in New York, thanks for holding, brother.
[02:40:15.840 --> 02:40:16.840]  Then we'll go to Mike.
[02:40:16.840 --> 02:40:17.840]  Go ahead, Ron.
[02:40:17.840 --> 02:40:19.840]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:40:19.840 --> 02:40:20.840]  Alex, I heard...
[02:40:20.840 --> 02:40:22.840]  I hadn't heard you in about five, two or three years.
[02:40:22.840 --> 02:40:24.840]  You're a retired police officer, right?
[02:40:24.840 --> 02:40:25.840]  That's correct.
[02:40:25.840 --> 02:40:26.840]  Okay.
[02:40:26.840 --> 02:40:27.840]  Okay, go ahead.
[02:40:27.840 --> 02:40:28.840]  Good to hear from you.
[02:40:28.840 --> 02:40:29.840]  What's on your mind?
[02:40:29.840 --> 02:40:32.840]  I heard an interview this morning that was very interesting.
[02:40:32.840 --> 02:40:37.840]  And it was with Mark Potock of the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[02:40:37.840 --> 02:40:45.840]  And I listened very carefully to what he said and reflected very heavily on every word that he said.
[02:40:45.840 --> 02:40:49.840]  And I don't know that most people would listen to an interview in that way, but I did.
[02:40:49.840 --> 02:40:57.840]  He was talking to Amy Goodman, and he was making a statement that here we have the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[02:40:57.840 --> 02:41:02.840]  And I say we have this organization which is unaccountable.
[02:41:02.840 --> 02:41:04.840]  It's not elected by anybody.
[02:41:04.840 --> 02:41:05.840]  It's non-governmental.
[02:41:05.840 --> 02:41:07.840]  It is non-transparent.
[02:41:07.840 --> 02:41:10.840]  And it is self-appointed.
[02:41:10.840 --> 02:41:20.840]  And he was making remarks, and they were talking about the shooting in Wisconsin, of course, that they monitor a great deal of the population.
[02:41:20.840 --> 02:41:22.840]  They monitor the shortwave radio, he says.
[02:41:22.840 --> 02:41:25.840]  They monitor the websites that they consider neo-Nazi.
[02:41:25.840 --> 02:41:35.840]  And it turns out they even monitor, though he didn't say this directly, but he says when people go to these websites, they find out who they are.
[02:41:35.840 --> 02:41:44.840]  Then he said that, well, there was a disturbing pattern in the 1990s of people he described as neo-Nazis joining the military.
[02:41:44.840 --> 02:41:54.840]  That he and his organization went to the United States military and then told them who they believed these people that were neo-Nazis were.
[02:41:54.840 --> 02:41:58.840]  And that the military should not allow them to join the army.
[02:41:58.840 --> 02:41:59.840]  No, no, no.
[02:41:59.840 --> 02:42:07.840]  They always operate as if, just like the George Soros groups think progress in media matters, as if they're God.
[02:42:07.840 --> 02:42:15.840]  I mean, if they say you should jump out a window, you should, because they're little chicken-net control freaks who ran Elohim City.
[02:42:15.840 --> 02:42:17.840]  And there they are.
[02:42:17.840 --> 02:42:19.840]  They sit up there like they're God.
[02:42:19.840 --> 02:42:24.840]  They're already aware of his statements in the past, in the past of that effect.
[02:42:24.840 --> 02:42:39.840]  What really struck me is after thinking through his comments, I'm saying to myself, we have this, as I said, self-appointed, non-transparent, unaccountable organization in high-level discussion with high-level agencies of our government.
[02:42:39.840 --> 02:42:41.840]  Sir, do you know why?
[02:42:41.840 --> 02:42:47.840]  Because they are the governmental commissars, the political enforcers of the foreign banks.
[02:42:47.840 --> 02:42:53.840]  The Southern Poverty Law Center in ADL, for all intents and purposes, are our government, sir.
[02:42:53.840 --> 02:43:00.840]  Just like top White House officials run think progress, and they've said, I need to be shut down, basically, and so does Drudge.
[02:43:00.840 --> 02:43:01.840]  No, no, no.
[02:43:01.840 --> 02:43:02.840]  I mean, they are the government.
[02:43:02.840 --> 02:43:04.840]  They are the occupiers.
[02:43:04.840 --> 02:43:07.840]  In this case, as I said, I reflected on it.
[02:43:07.840 --> 02:43:11.840]  I said to myself, you could have American citizens who are looking to join the army.
[02:43:11.840 --> 02:43:24.840]  They might just be limited to that circumstance, but at least that much he admitted to, who, just because they might have visited a website or they might have had contact with something which doesn't necessarily mean anything,
[02:43:24.840 --> 02:43:29.840]  just prima facie considered terroristic or neo-nazi was suppressed.
[02:43:29.840 --> 02:43:31.840]  Well, sir, you know what he really said.
[02:43:31.840 --> 02:43:32.840]  Hold on.
[02:43:32.840 --> 02:43:33.840]  You know what he really said.
[02:43:33.840 --> 02:43:37.840]  The ADL got arrested, and they've lost lawsuits over this.
[02:43:37.840 --> 02:43:41.840]  They used to break in police departments and steal files, intelligence files.
[02:43:41.840 --> 02:43:48.840]  Now they just run the department, so they don't need to do that, and it's all uploaded into federal systems, and they can put, you know, put whatever they want in there.
[02:43:48.840 --> 02:43:55.840]  What he's saying is, is yes, they've got access, and I've talked to, I'm not going to say anything.
[02:43:55.840 --> 02:43:56.840]  I'm just going to be quiet at this point.
[02:43:56.840 --> 02:44:03.840]  The point is, is that I'd already gotten that information that they have access to NSA hard feeds.
[02:44:03.840 --> 02:44:11.840]  The Israelis on record run the phone system data mining for much of the federal government.
[02:44:11.840 --> 02:44:15.840]  So yes, these guys can just dial right in to whatever you're doing.
[02:44:15.840 --> 02:44:16.840]  They're God, basically.
[02:44:16.840 --> 02:44:18.840]  Okay, Demi, do you understand that?
[02:44:18.840 --> 02:44:24.840]  That's what he was saying on the show, is that they've got the back doors into everything.
[02:44:24.840 --> 02:44:31.840]  This is what my concern is that we have people, as I said, who are self-appointed in non-transparent organizations.
[02:44:31.840 --> 02:44:34.840]  We don't know who funds them, finances them.
[02:44:34.840 --> 02:44:40.840]  We don't know any of the details about any of the major participants in these organizations who are doing this.
[02:44:40.840 --> 02:44:41.840]  Now he tipped his hand.
[02:44:41.840 --> 02:44:52.840]  He said, oh, we only get public domain information, but that contradicted a statement he made moments before when he said, we get information on people who buy things from, you know, companies at these websites.
[02:44:52.840 --> 02:44:56.840]  No, that's why, no, no, that's why he added that later, exactly.
[02:44:56.840 --> 02:45:01.840]  That's not public domain information, so how would you know who buys what from whom?
[02:45:01.840 --> 02:45:16.840]  Sir, they had one of their Southern Prairie Law Center writers who's one of their operatives within hours of that cop killer saying he did it because for me, when it turned out the guy was a white supremacist who was attacking me and saying I was going to get it.
[02:45:16.840 --> 02:45:19.840]  I mean, imagine how much I'm on their radar.
[02:45:19.840 --> 02:45:28.840]  The guy kills three cops and within two hours it's in the newspaper that it's my fault.
[02:45:28.840 --> 02:45:37.840]  Then we found the guy's handle and proved that he was saying he was going to get me and then they had to retract.
[02:45:37.840 --> 02:45:44.840]  But I mean, again, they, folks, when I say we're in danger, think progress says they want our funding shut off, whatever that means.
[02:45:44.840 --> 02:45:54.840]  And media matters got caught in their own memos saying they wanted to infiltrate media organizations to destroy them, to sabotage.
[02:45:54.840 --> 02:45:57.840]  I mean, these are military operations.
[02:45:57.840 --> 02:46:03.840]  These are globalist frontline commissars for the takeover.
[02:46:03.840 --> 02:46:06.840]  They are the collaborator agents.
[02:46:06.840 --> 02:46:14.840]  I mean, I've talked to people that work inside that facility, the Southern Prairie Law Center, and they say it's got higher security than basically the White House.
[02:46:14.840 --> 02:46:16.840]  Well, yeah, because it is the White House.
[02:46:16.840 --> 02:46:18.840]  It's the banker house.
[02:46:18.840 --> 02:46:19.840]  It's an NSA hub.
[02:46:19.840 --> 02:46:20.840]  Go ahead.
[02:46:20.840 --> 02:46:44.840]  Media matters is tax-free and runs around saying it's their job to destroy alternative media, infiltrate and destroy.
[02:46:44.840 --> 02:46:45.840]  Look it up.
[02:46:45.840 --> 02:46:50.840]  It was even in Politico and Politico thought it was cute.
[02:46:50.840 --> 02:46:53.840]  Oh, they're going to infiltrate the alternative media from within and sabotage it.
[02:46:53.840 --> 02:47:01.840]  I mean, imagine if I imagine if a memo came out where I said I was going to infiltrate say the Dallas Morning News and I was going to sabotage them.
[02:47:01.840 --> 02:47:05.840]  I would be arrested for conspiracy to commit crimes.
[02:47:05.840 --> 02:47:11.840]  So you had gone that far and done that and there was no question or investigation of it.
[02:47:11.840 --> 02:47:19.840]  And this guy Potok this morning basically did that and what amazed me is certainly no one interviewing him and I to my knowledge, nobody else.
[02:47:19.840 --> 02:47:21.840]  Well, they are listening right now.
[02:47:21.840 --> 02:47:22.840]  They are listening right now.
[02:47:22.840 --> 02:47:24.840]  What do you want to say to him?
[02:47:24.840 --> 02:47:40.840]  Well, I want to say to him that if they are so worried about watching everybody else and determining their level of patriotism and whether they fit the model of a good American, then they should set the example and they should be transparent and forthcoming about their own operations and about their
[02:47:40.840 --> 02:47:46.840]  own funding and basically who they are and what is it that they represent, particularly in the area of funding.
[02:47:46.840 --> 02:47:51.840]  I mean, it is it is a tax exempt organization and they do have a legal obligation.
[02:47:51.840 --> 02:47:56.840]  I'm only asking those good Americans to live up to their legal obligation to make these facts transparent.
[02:47:56.840 --> 02:47:59.840]  Well, that's another point all over the country.
[02:47:59.840 --> 02:48:05.840]  Last time I checked over a thousand Tea Party grips have been audited and shut down for no reason.
[02:48:05.840 --> 02:48:19.840]  Why does media matters get to be tax free when it's publicly run by White House officials and has the weekly meetings and think progress is publicly funded by George Soros and has the White House transition chief as its head.
[02:48:19.840 --> 02:48:25.840]  I mean, why is the White House calling for me to be basically shut down with a tax free organization?
[02:48:25.840 --> 02:48:28.840]  Can you imagine if I tried to be tax free?
[02:48:28.840 --> 02:48:30.840]  Ron, what would happen?
[02:48:30.840 --> 02:48:35.840]  First off, you would never be given the designated status by the Internal Revenue Service.
[02:48:35.840 --> 02:48:41.840]  And if you were, the second you went one inch out of line, you know that they'd bring a hammer down on you if that were to even happen.
[02:48:41.840 --> 02:48:45.840]  But they wouldn't even designate you as a tax exempt organization.
[02:48:45.840 --> 02:48:50.840]  But the point is this, the larger point is they're watching everybody.
[02:48:50.840 --> 02:48:56.840]  They admit just about that and making judgments about thousands, maybe millions of people for all I know.
[02:48:56.840 --> 02:48:58.840]  Who's watching the watches?
[02:48:58.840 --> 02:49:04.840]  Well, by the way, they've got this whole chicken neck cover. They're very dangerous people.
[02:49:04.840 --> 02:49:19.840]  Even the man's disposition, if you heard him talk, and if you've ever seen him before, and if you heard him talk in this morning's interview, the man is drooling, dripping, oozing with arrogance, oozing with the sense of I have power and, you know...
[02:49:19.840 --> 02:49:21.840]  Oh, I know, it's disgusting.
[02:49:21.840 --> 02:49:28.840]  And you know what they do have power? They've taken this country over, it's theirs now, and they've got TV shows coming out on ABC TV.
[02:49:28.840 --> 02:49:32.840]  We're called Founding Fathers, where Texas gun owners are bad.
[02:49:32.840 --> 02:49:36.840]  I mean, they've got shows coming out where families are bad, fathers are bad.
[02:49:36.840 --> 02:49:40.840]  Every movie we try to go see for the children, fathers are bad.
[02:49:40.840 --> 02:49:43.840]  We're going to do a review of Brave, where the men are bad.
[02:49:43.840 --> 02:49:47.840]  I mean, it's just, look, they run things. All of this is theirs.
[02:49:47.840 --> 02:49:57.840]  I mean, they did it, and now they want our guns, and I just can't believe so many police getting these meetings where they badmouth George Washington on video.
[02:49:57.840 --> 02:50:02.840]  I've got video of it, and cops call in and say they've seen it and upset them, but they say a lot of the...
[02:50:02.840 --> 02:50:09.840]  I mean, any of your buddies that are still in the police department are any of them waking up, or is there nothing they won't do?
[02:50:09.840 --> 02:50:15.840]  If they ordered them like Stalin did to arrest a million people and put them in a meat grinder, would they do it?
[02:50:15.840 --> 02:50:21.840]  We've spoken about this. I have called your show since about 2002, and we spoke about this early on.
[02:50:21.840 --> 02:50:25.840]  I know I haven't called them the last few years, but I spoke about this back then.
[02:50:25.840 --> 02:50:31.840]  As a matter of fact, you actually disagreed with me. You fought me a little bit on this point, and I said, poor Alex doesn't really know.
[02:50:31.840 --> 02:50:37.840]  He's trying to be nice. You were trying to be nice is what you were trying to be, but sometimes you have to be truth.
[02:50:37.840 --> 02:50:38.840]  That's the nice, you know...
[02:50:38.840 --> 02:50:41.840]  So what did you say? You said the police will put us in meat grinders.
[02:50:41.840 --> 02:50:46.840]  I said that. Remember that? I told you that a long time ago. These are careerists, paramilitarists.
[02:50:46.840 --> 02:50:49.840]  These are the type of guys they've hired now, ever since the Quentin era.
[02:50:49.840 --> 02:51:12.840]  And they get to fight a bunch of women and children, drugged out, poisoned Americans. It must be fun to play military with a bunch of zombies.
[02:51:19.840 --> 02:51:30.840]  Getting involved politically, hunting and fishing, gardening, dating. This is a place for people who love freedom to meet and to talk and to write and to post information.

[02:53:59.840 --> 02:54:06.840]  Tonight, I will be hosting the InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:54:06.840 --> 02:54:13.840]  We're going to be breaking down GMO Fed hamsters become infertile, have stunted growth.
[02:54:13.840 --> 02:54:21.840]  Another big study is out on this. Another big scientific study.
[02:54:21.840 --> 02:54:31.840]  I mean, there's just so many of these, and this is what we're being fed. They are killing us dead in the hammer, man.
[02:54:31.840 --> 02:54:37.840]  They're killing our capacity genetically to have offspring, and that is true death.
[02:54:37.840 --> 02:54:41.840]  Man, they're cold-blooded. They said they'd do it and they're doing it.
[02:54:41.840 --> 02:54:48.840]  But you know, in a way, it's so over the top, they're evil, that I don't worry about myself or my family.
[02:54:48.840 --> 02:54:53.840]  I don't know how to explain it. It's so bad it's liberating.
[02:54:53.840 --> 02:55:00.840]  It's so bad that it just nothing means anything anymore.
[02:55:00.840 --> 02:55:08.840]  I mean, if some guy cuts me off and flips me off or some big guy bows up to me walking out of a store, I just say yes, sir, to him.
[02:55:08.840 --> 02:55:11.840]  Used to that would just torture me if I didn't beat the daylights out of him.
[02:55:11.840 --> 02:55:14.840]  And I would feel like a big wimp. Now I'm just like, yes, sir.
[02:55:14.840 --> 02:55:18.840]  Because I realize there's just a brain-damaged zombie being poisoned and prepared for death.
[02:55:18.840 --> 02:55:23.840]  I mean, again, status means nothing. Nothing means anything anymore.
[02:55:23.840 --> 02:55:28.840]  But defeating these people, and my only frustration is I can't do enough.
[02:55:28.840 --> 02:55:41.840]  I don't work hard enough to beat these people.
[02:55:41.840 --> 02:55:46.840]  I work really hard to bring in this information, and I've got a bunch of news I got to in the shower, but a bunch I didn't.
[02:55:46.840 --> 02:55:49.840]  I'm going to blitz it tonight. I'm going to make myself cover it all the nightly news.
[02:55:49.840 --> 02:55:53.840]  If you're not a PrisonPlanet.tv subscriber, it's 15 cents a day.
[02:55:53.840 --> 02:55:56.840]  The same username in PASCA can be used by six people.
[02:55:56.840 --> 02:55:59.840]  So it's really six memberships for $5.95 a month.
[02:55:59.840 --> 02:56:02.840]  And it is your membership that funds this.
[02:56:02.840 --> 02:56:06.840]  I want to thank everybody, despite the fact we're in a depression in many areas of the country,
[02:56:06.840 --> 02:56:13.840]  recession and others, for supporting us and getting the word out and standing beside us all these years.
[02:56:13.840 --> 02:56:16.840]  Our AM and FM affiliates, our sponsors, our listeners.
[02:56:16.840 --> 02:56:19.840]  I just, I really want to thank you.
[02:56:19.840 --> 02:56:26.840]  And I do the best I can, but I just want you to know I'm honored that you've supported us and that you believe in us.
[02:56:26.840 --> 02:56:29.840]  And I care about you. I love you.
[02:56:29.840 --> 02:56:32.840]  I love everybody that loves freedom and loves the truth.
[02:56:32.840 --> 02:56:39.840]  And it's so painful to see the zombies that serve the New World Order.
[02:56:39.840 --> 02:56:46.840]  All the different flavors of them who think they're winners, who think they're on the winning team.
[02:56:46.840 --> 02:56:53.840]  And I wish people like POTOC and others would just wake up and realize just how evil this whole system is.
[02:56:53.840 --> 02:56:58.840]  I mean, maybe they know about the eugenics, but usually it's compartmentalized.
[02:56:58.840 --> 02:57:08.840]  But most people in this evil system, they don't get a memo to avoid the GMO like the Monsanto engineers who do not eat GMO
[02:57:08.840 --> 02:57:13.840]  and whose plants don't allow it to be served.
[02:57:13.840 --> 02:57:17.840]  That's a big deal. You can look that up. That's London Telegraph, you name it.
[02:57:17.840 --> 02:57:21.840]  I remember the first time I heard that like six months ago. I didn't know it was like 12-year-old news.
[02:57:21.840 --> 02:57:28.840]  And since then, I've been in the news dozens of times.
[02:57:28.840 --> 02:57:33.840]  I saw that information and just blew me away.
[02:57:33.840 --> 02:57:36.840]  I'll have to do a little bit of overdrive because I promise to go to Mike.
[02:57:36.840 --> 02:57:43.840]  So we'll go to break, come back a little five minute and go to Mike and maybe a few others.
[02:57:43.840 --> 02:57:47.840]  When I take off a few days, you notice I'm calling in the whole time. I'm not really taking off.
[02:57:47.840 --> 02:57:51.840]  A lot of times I'm here in the office when I take off for a few weeks, a couple of days.
[02:57:51.840 --> 02:57:56.840]  I'm here trying to get the new reporters in place, the new equipment, the new editing software,
[02:57:56.840 --> 02:58:04.840]  the new research, the background, this newspaper I'm launching.
[02:58:04.840 --> 02:58:13.840]  And I just wish that I could impart the knowledge, the total commitment.
[02:58:13.840 --> 02:58:20.840]  That's not even the right word. The knowledge.
[02:58:20.840 --> 02:58:24.840]  I mean, I know I'm right. I know. And I have all their admissions.
[02:58:24.840 --> 02:58:28.840]  I've got several books over there on the bookshelf written by the White House Science Star
[02:58:28.840 --> 02:58:32.840]  where he talks about putting stuff in your food and water, which that was written in the 70s.
[02:58:32.840 --> 02:58:36.840]  They do. I mean, these are absolute criminal murderers.
[02:58:36.840 --> 02:58:42.840]  I mean, I don't know what else I'm supposed to say. Somebody's got to stop them.
[02:58:42.840 --> 02:58:45.840]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:45.840 --> 02:59:14.840]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[02:59:15.840 --> 02:59:38.840]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[02:59:38.840 --> 02:59:47.840]  That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:59:47.840 --> 02:59:51.840]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:59:51.840 --> 03:00:16.840]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:16.840 --> 03:00:22.840]  Yeah, we're living in a science fiction movie.
[03:00:22.840 --> 03:00:33.840]  We've got our own species who've set up a predatory psyche, a predatory hierarchy,
[03:00:33.840 --> 03:00:36.840]  where we are the prey by some twist of fate.
[03:00:36.840 --> 03:00:41.840]  We the Eloy are the prey. They the Morlocks, the rulers.
[03:00:41.840 --> 03:00:46.840]  I don't like it, and I don't want to give the planet and our whole future over to these people.
[03:00:46.840 --> 03:00:48.840]  Things are going to get real crazy real quick.
[03:00:48.840 --> 03:00:55.840]  They're not getting ready to go operational with martial law because they're playing games.
[03:00:55.840 --> 03:00:59.840]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in mass.
[03:00:59.840 --> 03:01:02.840]  Thanks for holding, Mike. We got to you, though. Go ahead.
[03:01:02.840 --> 03:01:04.840]  Hey, thanks for going into Overdrive, Alex.
[03:01:04.840 --> 03:01:08.840]  I miss the days when you guys used to do about an hour every day.
[03:01:08.840 --> 03:01:13.840]  But I had a question real quick. You spoke earlier about, I can't remember his name,
[03:01:13.840 --> 03:01:17.840]  some guy who went to a conference talking about how we should kill all of us or most of us.
[03:01:17.840 --> 03:01:20.840]  Who was that and where can I get information on that?
[03:01:20.840 --> 03:01:22.840]  There's a whole bunch of them. I mean, who are you talking about?
[03:01:22.840 --> 03:01:29.840]  Peter Singer, Dr. Eric Pionka, you're talking about John T. Holdren, you're talking about Ted Turner,
[03:01:29.840 --> 03:01:35.840]  you're talking about Prince Charles, Prince Philip, Maury Strong, United Nations Biological Diversity Assessment,
[03:01:35.840 --> 03:01:40.840]  State Department memorandum 200. I mean, they basically all of them say it.
[03:01:40.840 --> 03:01:47.840]  If you see the director of a major federal health department, go look up their name and population reduction
[03:01:47.840 --> 03:01:56.840]  or their name in eugenics. You're not in the ruling elite unless you swear that you want to kill everybody.
[03:01:56.840 --> 03:02:00.840]  Yeah, I guess that's the in vogue, the thing to do these days.
[03:02:00.840 --> 03:02:06.840]  Prince 1850, sure has been, yep. No, no, no, I'm serious. No, I'm serious.
[03:02:06.840 --> 03:02:09.840]  That took over the British Empire. That's what the whole thing's about.
[03:02:09.840 --> 03:02:14.840]  No, I'm well aware. I've been following Aaron Dykes's assessment of the eugenics movement.
[03:02:14.840 --> 03:02:19.840]  It's very enlightening. The other question, I can't seem to find any information on this.
[03:02:19.840 --> 03:02:26.840]  Maybe you remember maybe a year or two ago during the swine flu thing, Massachusetts tried to pass some legislation
[03:02:26.840 --> 03:02:31.840]  for forced inoculations. Yeah, just type in Massachusetts forced inoculations.
[03:02:31.840 --> 03:02:38.840]  They were going to force nurses and then under the health emergency.
[03:02:38.840 --> 03:02:42.840]  What's the name of that thing? I had trouble with it the other day because it's from 2002.
[03:02:42.840 --> 03:02:47.840]  They were trying to implement that piecemeal, the Health States Emergency Powers Act,
[03:02:47.840 --> 03:02:51.840]  or the Model Health States Emergency Powers Act. There you go.
[03:02:51.840 --> 03:02:58.840]  And under that, oh yeah, but they're already hitting like any criminal, any pedophile, any drug dealer.
[03:02:58.840 --> 03:03:02.840]  They're already hitting our kids. They already shoot them up from Alabama to California.
[03:03:02.840 --> 03:03:07.840]  They already light them up and shoot them up. We have big breaking news on that with Mike Adams on Thursday,
[03:03:07.840 --> 03:03:14.840]  knowingly killing us with the vaccines. Just again, there's no end to their murderousness.
[03:03:14.840 --> 03:03:19.840]  But yeah, that was in the Boston Globe. I bet I can find it right now. Keep talking.
[03:03:19.840 --> 03:03:24.840]  Yeah, well, I was trying to figure out whether or not it had passed because I know it went up for the vote.
[03:03:24.840 --> 03:03:31.840]  But specifically, I know that it mentioned how if the governor declares a state of emergency,
[03:03:31.840 --> 03:03:34.840]  they can evacuate homes, snatch children.
[03:03:34.840 --> 03:03:40.840]  Yeah, no, no, I mean, I just typed it in. Massachusetts mandatory vaccine bill leads the way to,
[03:03:40.840 --> 03:03:47.840]  and it goes on. Mike Adams wrote about it, but then it has links to the local news.
[03:03:47.840 --> 03:03:52.840]  Yeah, arrest for refusal to be decontaminated, forced quarantine for those that refuse
[03:03:52.840 --> 03:03:59.840]  illegal imprisonment without charge, forced vaccinations, $1,000 a day fines, involuntary transportation,
[03:03:59.840 --> 03:04:04.840]  government price controls, violation of the 14th Amendment, violation of the Fourth Amendment.
[03:04:04.840 --> 03:04:13.840]  Yeah, there it is. Isolation camps. And then he's got links to mass.gov.
[03:04:13.840 --> 03:04:18.840]  There at the bottom, it's got the mass.gov.com.
[03:04:18.840 --> 03:04:24.840]  M-E-M-E-U-H-H-T-M. Yep, there it is. Larry Loving.
[03:04:24.840 --> 03:04:27.840]  I'll just copy that and put it in the computer right now and show people.
[03:04:27.840 --> 03:04:30.840]  What's on your mind today? Anything else loving?
[03:04:30.840 --> 03:04:35.840]  I had an idea, actually, for your show, if you were curious.
[03:04:35.840 --> 03:04:38.840]  Yeah, go ahead. I was telling him to punch out my screen. Go ahead. There it is.
[03:04:38.840 --> 03:04:43.840]  Yeah, it's like a flanker to the nightly news. Maybe if you had somebody like Chris Springmeyer
[03:04:43.840 --> 03:04:49.840]  with more information-dense books to do a seminar series, like one hour a week or something.
[03:04:49.840 --> 03:04:53.840]  I agree. We want to do it all. We want a seminar series, the gun show.
[03:04:53.840 --> 03:04:57.840]  We just got to get the people and the infrastructure in place.
[03:04:57.840 --> 03:05:09.840]  All right. See you tonight.
