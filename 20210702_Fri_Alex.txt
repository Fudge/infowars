[00:00.000 --> 00:18.000]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:31.000 --> 00:36.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:46.000 --> 00:52.000]  It was a year ago that Michael Ryan, the head of the United Nations Global Rapid Reaction Corps, said,
[00:52.000 --> 00:58.000]  The ultimate goal is they've now carried out more than 100 countries to go into your homes, forcibly test you,
[00:59.000 --> 01:02.000]  and take your loved ones away from you based on fraudulent PCR tests.
[01:03.000 --> 01:09.000]  This is martial law. We now have major leaders in Canada saying they're using COVID to bring in martial law to silence dissent.
[01:10.000 --> 01:15.000]  They say it in national TV press conferences. They are going public with tyranny.
[01:15.000 --> 01:25.000]  And now, Biden has launched the COVID tracking teams in the name of the Delta tracking teams, the Delta plus variant tracking teams,
[01:26.000 --> 01:33.000]  coming door to door to harass the unvaccinated. This is not the velvet glove and the iron fist. This is the iron fist.
[01:33.000 --> 01:46.000]  In most parts of the world, due to lockdown, most of the transmission that's actually happening in many countries now is happening in the household, at family level.
[01:47.000 --> 01:52.000]  In some senses, transmission has been taken off the streets and pushed back into family units.
[01:52.000 --> 02:03.000]  Now, we need to go and look in families to find those people who may be sick and remove them and isolate them in a safe and dignified manner.
[02:04.000 --> 02:10.000]  It's now my great pleasure to invite Lady Gaga.
[02:10.000 --> 02:22.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's how sick these people are. Casting themselves as the heroes, the rest of us as the evil disease spreaders.
[02:23.000 --> 02:32.000]  And now, Biden and White House deploy Delta variant response teams across the US to communities with low vaccination rates.
[02:32.000 --> 02:41.000]  And they're going to force their way into homes and, quote, force people to be tested with fraudulent machines that are 94% false positive.
[02:42.000 --> 02:52.000]  And it's far worse than that already in Europe, Canada, places like Australia, where they have been arresting people for a year that protest online the lockdowns.
[02:53.000 --> 02:55.000]  You're not allowed to do that in big tech sensors you have used as well.
[02:55.000 --> 03:08.000]  They also censor medical treatments, medical doctors. This is a giant exercise in raping our freedoms, raping our speech, raping our bodies and forcing their deadly gene therapies into us.
[03:09.000 --> 03:12.000]  There can no longer be any doubt.
[03:14.000 --> 03:19.000]  There can no longer be any doubt, ladies and gentlemen, of what's really going on.
[03:19.000 --> 03:29.000]  There's now CBS, ABC, NBC, they're all reporting on what I've been telling you for months that, oh, it's funny.
[03:31.000 --> 03:41.000]  When people go in to get the shots at Walgreens or at Walmart or at CBS or at government facilities, they look at the person's race and go, oh, you're black.
[03:42.000 --> 03:47.000]  I mean, look at a clipboard and go, you're getting this shot. You're white. You're getting this one. You're Asian. You're getting this one.
[03:47.000 --> 03:56.000]  And they sometimes give them different vaccines or sometimes they go to different lots and then of the supposed same, Pfizer or Moderna or other.
[03:57.000 --> 04:00.000]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, they just went for broke.
[04:01.000 --> 04:08.000]  And here's the deal. If you saw that in a science fiction movie, you'd be like, how obvious it is that they're targeting certain groups.
[04:09.000 --> 04:11.000]  But they're killing black, white. It doesn't matter.
[04:11.000 --> 04:17.000]  But then certain vaccines you see are race specific, which they also admit.
[04:18.000 --> 04:24.000]  And it seems to be hitting black folks a lot harder than it's been hitting white folks, but it is killing a lot of white people as well.
[04:25.000 --> 04:33.000]  This is so diabolical and it's in the mainstream news articles what callers were calling in when the injection started six months ago.
[04:33.000 --> 04:41.000]  And it's like, hey, I'm black and I was at the Walgreens and I saw a black lady getting one vaccine and a white lady was giving another one.
[04:42.000 --> 04:44.000]  I got mainstream news going. We don't know why they're doing that.
[04:45.000 --> 04:51.000]  I mean, whoa, who's giving the directives? Grab the clipboard. Find out what the directions are.
[04:52.000 --> 04:55.000]  This is mass crime. This is mass murder. Holy hell.
[04:55.000 --> 05:03.000]  The fourth of July super sales starts now and in four more stores.
[05:04.000 --> 05:09.000]  July 4th, 2021 is now upon us. And that means our yearly big sale is here.

[05:42.000 --> 05:44.000]  So the stuff I just listed is going to be on sale through July 4th.

[05:55.000 --> 05:59.000]  The fourth of July super sales starts now at infowarstore.com.
[05:59.000 --> 06:19.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want to stop tyranny? Well so does he.
[06:19.000 --> 06:29.000]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[06:30.000 --> 06:40.000]  Bill Gates, Klaus Schwab, Ted Turner, Prince Philip, Prince Charles, Queen Elizabeth, and I can just go on for about five hours here.
[06:40.000 --> 06:50.000]  They've all set on record they want to set up a world government with forced inoculations to then inject you with vaccines that bare minimum sterilize you.
[06:51.000 --> 07:04.000]  Now when I first read this in books in 1990 when I was still in high school, when I was a junior and then senior in high school, I thought well I'm not going to just believe this book put out by the John Burt society.
[07:04.000 --> 07:15.000]  So I went down to the UT library because local libraries didn't have it and I pulled up the damn newspaper articles on the micro fish and I read it right there with David Rockefeller and others saying it.
[07:16.000 --> 07:23.000]  And I thought wow, a global government to forcibly inject me and sterilize my ass. I better do something about that.
[07:23.000 --> 07:36.000]  And here we are. I've been on air since 1995 and we've gone from the beta test to now living in the New World Order system.
[07:37.000 --> 07:41.000]  And believe me, this is the New World Order's world. This is Satan's world.
[07:41.000 --> 07:52.000]  I saw one of the big top black podcasters right up there with Charlemagne, the God, so he calls himself one of the other big guys.
[07:53.000 --> 07:57.000]  Charlemagne's actually said some nice things about me, I guess got heat for it. So yeah, I guess Jones is right about this or that.
[07:58.000 --> 08:01.000]  But there's another big podcaster with millions of listeners today. I'll get to it later.
[08:01.000 --> 08:13.000]  He's like, Jones is a racist and Jones shouldn't go on Andrew Schultz's show and Andrew Schultz because he calls the show with a black guy, shouldn't be associated with other white people that are in the KKK like Alex Jones.
[08:14.000 --> 08:21.000]  No proof, no evidence, they just say that and he goes, yeah, Jones wants to get the black audience. He knows it's a black man's world.
[08:22.000 --> 08:29.000]  No, it's Satan's world. But again, all the corporate sponsors have black people as their front person now.
[08:29.000 --> 08:37.000]  Common as China does, all of it, to hide their operations behind black people and then black people on average.
[08:38.000 --> 08:42.000]  I listen and watch the shows. I mean, I think these are entertaining shows actually.
[08:43.000 --> 08:48.000]  And this particular host was attacking me. He has an amazing voice. I mean, I can't quite listen to it, even though he's lying about me.
[08:49.000 --> 08:53.000]  And I just want everybody to live in peace. I love him no matter what color he is.
[08:53.000 --> 08:58.000]  He's a dumbed-down anti-white racist. This is this host I'll get to later.
[08:59.000 --> 09:06.000]  It's one of the Allied code shows with Charlemagne that are right up their rival in Joe Rogan, his biggest shows in America.
[09:07.000 --> 09:13.000]  And he's talking about, yeah, black people are taking over.
[09:14.000 --> 09:18.000]  Oh, you mean like the tens of millions extra that are starved to death since the lockdown?
[09:19.000 --> 09:21.000]  And it's designed to starve Africans? You mean you're taking over that way?
[09:21.000 --> 09:29.000]  So again, while black people are being exterminated, the black leadership of media, led by Oprah Winfrey, they think they're in charge.
[09:30.000 --> 09:39.000]  They think they know what's going on. And they think because every TV ad you'll see and every show you see and every corporate pitch person you see,
[09:40.000 --> 09:45.000]  I mean, I'm talking about 90% is black. Like somebody flipped a switch. That doesn't help black people.
[09:45.000 --> 09:51.000]  I'm fine. Have people be black spokesperson. I don't care about that.
[09:52.000 --> 10:03.000]  It's the point of when it's suddenly nothing but black people, that's the globalist system hiding behind black people.
[10:03.000 --> 10:14.000]  Just like if you oppose gun control or open borders, well, you're a racist, or if you're against force inoculation, or you're against medical IDs,
[10:15.000 --> 10:20.000]  or you're against lockdowns, it says in the official report, if that guy, if you pull that out of my stack, put out two weeks ago by Biden,
[10:21.000 --> 10:28.000]  the official counterterrorism shift to the U.S. is if you don't like lockdowns, you are a terrorist, quote, white supremacist.
[10:28.000 --> 10:35.000]  Well, that's dumbed down. That doesn't even make sense. What does that have to do not wanting a lockdown with being a white supremacist?
[10:36.000 --> 10:41.000]  I can pull you up a thousand news articles with that headline, protesting a lockdown as white supremacist.
[10:42.000 --> 10:51.000]  This is a talking point. And it's so silly because if you pull back from it, you can see all of humanities under attack.
[10:51.000 --> 11:00.000]  We to come together against the globalist and we've got Bill Gates that says he wants to depopulate the planet and he's running the vaccine program.
[11:01.000 --> 11:08.000]  And then they go out and they hire Run DMC to cut all these cartoon videos for children.
[11:09.000 --> 11:17.000]  And the first one came out and said, fight the racist, take the shot. The next one said, fight the eugenicist and the depopulationists.
[11:17.000 --> 11:20.000]  And it shows him cutting down the eugenics tree.
[11:21.000 --> 11:29.000]  Take your shot. When you take the shot, what you're doing is basically giving yourself infertility, cancer and so many other things.
[11:30.000 --> 11:33.000]  And I guess the argument is, I don't care if you're black or you're white, what color you are.
[11:34.000 --> 11:42.000]  If you're dumb enough to think Bill Gates loves you and you really think Alex Jones is the bad guy, Bill Gates is the good guy, like this talk show host.
[11:42.000 --> 11:46.000]  Well, then I guess that's what you deserve.
[11:47.000 --> 11:57.000]  It's the Joe Boudin, Joe Boudin show, millions of viewers a day even on YouTube.
[11:58.000 --> 12:06.000]  And I know he's got host one of the biggest shows out there, calls out Andrew Schultz for having Alex Jones on Flager 2 and says, it's like a 10 minute round.
[12:06.000 --> 12:14.000]  I'm not going to play the whole thing that I'm the KKK and the Candace Owens that are watch out being with us at the KKK.
[12:15.000 --> 12:22.000]  Oh, but he likes Joe Biden who actually was in the KKK, the evidence overwhelming, but it doesn't even matter.
[12:23.000 --> 12:26.000]  It's Bill Gates and the globalist attacking everybody.
[12:27.000 --> 12:28.000]  And here's the big news.
[12:29.000 --> 12:33.000]  I heard this six months ago from listeners that called in.
[12:33.000 --> 12:35.000]  And now it's in mainstream news.
[12:36.000 --> 12:38.000]  I have CBS, NBC, ABC, all of it right here.
[12:39.000 --> 12:45.000]  Links to it on infowords.com and article about why are so many people being given saline when they go in to get a shot?
[12:46.000 --> 12:47.000]  I've talked to people in Army Special Operations.
[12:48.000 --> 12:49.000]  I've talked to people in the Coast Guard.
[12:50.000 --> 12:51.000]  I've talked to people that are medical doctors.
[12:52.000 --> 12:53.000]  I've talked to people that are federal employees.
[12:53.000 --> 13:03.000]  And they say they're given saline and they're told, don't worry, this is saline or they shoot the shot the trash can.
[13:04.000 --> 13:14.000]  And of course, it was over a month ago that they had testimony in Congress that half of the CDC employees, including medical doctors and scientists and an NIH, National Institutes of Health, will not take the shot.
[13:15.000 --> 13:16.000]  What does that tell you?
[13:17.000 --> 13:18.000]  But then it gets worse.
[13:18.000 --> 13:22.000]  I've got the articles right here where it's not just saline.
[13:23.000 --> 13:27.000]  When people go in to government facilities or major drug stores, they go, oh, hold on, you're black.
[13:28.000 --> 13:29.000]  Let me get this one for you.
[13:30.000 --> 13:31.000]  And they read literature.
[13:32.000 --> 13:33.000]  Don't show you, okay, this is the one for you.
[13:34.000 --> 13:35.000]  And if you're white, they give you another one.
[13:36.000 --> 13:42.000]  Are you going to hear a word out of the cool racist black guy that said, oh, maybe the answer is segregating the black people from the white people?
[13:43.000 --> 13:44.000]  Because he said, we, we rule the earth.
[13:44.000 --> 13:49.000]  Everyone loves us. We're all the corporate sponsors. All the money's being dumped on us.
[13:50.000 --> 13:51.000]  Man, we're so cool.
[13:52.000 --> 13:55.000]  And the white people want to be our friends because we, it's a black planet.
[13:56.000 --> 14:04.000]  That's the power trip to have the few black leaders paid off to be talk show hosts and then lead black people to be anti-white.
[14:04.000 --> 14:13.000]  So white people then become racist and don't like blacks and everybody's divided and conquered. And it's all done in the name of unity, but it's the opposite.
[14:14.000 --> 14:18.000]  And meanwhile, this guy wouldn't know a racist if one walked up and bit him in the ass.
[14:21.000 --> 14:30.000]  I mean, I had Judge Joe Brown on, who by the way is coming on the Sunday show for a full hour, who was in a federal think tank back in the early 70s.
[14:30.000 --> 14:37.000]  Who saw Joe Biden say black people were cockroaches, but you're not going to say a damn thing about that because you'll get canceled, won't you?
[14:38.000 --> 14:42.000]  So you're a pimp. And I challenge you to debate.
[14:43.000 --> 14:51.000]  Come on my show, Joe, and tell me how I'm the KKK.
[14:52.000 --> 14:57.000]  Oh, yeah, Alex Jones and all them, you know, black people think they can listen to them.
[14:57.000 --> 15:00.000]  Why? They're over there with the KKK.
[15:01.000 --> 15:08.000]  And if you want to be over there in the KKK, man, you need to be slapped upside your dumbass head for your own good.
[15:09.000 --> 15:10.000]  And I'm not saying I'm going to do that.
[15:11.000 --> 15:12.000]  My point is what the hell's your problem?
[15:13.000 --> 15:25.000]  You don't even know who I am, but you get the talking point to try to police things and say Andrew Schultz shouldn't have Alex Jones on because Andrew Schultz is a white guy we have on these shows.
[15:25.000 --> 15:28.000]  And he shouldn't be on with the KKK guy.
[15:29.000 --> 15:33.000]  Meanwhile, there's Joe Biden with a former Grand Cyclops senator bird.
[15:34.000 --> 15:35.000]  That's the reality.
[15:37.000 --> 15:40.000]  And you work for those people.
[15:41.000 --> 15:46.000]  You work for big tech that lavishes you and promotes you and pushes you that runs death camps in China with the Uyghurs.
[15:47.000 --> 15:48.000]  That's on you show.
[15:50.000 --> 15:52.000]  And you got to face God for it.
[15:52.000 --> 15:55.000]  So you sit there and worship your KKK, daddy.
[15:56.000 --> 15:57.000]  I hope you burn in hell.
[16:01.000 --> 16:08.000]  Your voice counts when you share information, be it over the Internet or in person, it changes the world.
[16:09.000 --> 16:11.000]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[16:12.000 --> 16:13.000]  They know you're angry.
[16:14.000 --> 16:18.000]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.

[17:01.000 --> 17:06.000]  The globalists are having their revolution, but free humanity has to have its revolution.
[17:06.000 --> 17:16.000]  We have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers trying to enslave the entire biological processes of humans
[17:17.000 --> 17:23.000]  and turn us into these artificial, corporate, controlled slaves.
[17:24.000 --> 17:28.000]  Orson slaves are just property from cradle to grave of the system.
[17:28.000 --> 17:36.000]  Rendered down to be servile minions of the system and a ritual of dominance and satanic control.
[17:37.000 --> 17:43.000]  We have to recognize their great reset post-industrial world that realizes a nightmare dystopia and we have to promote liberty and freedom
[17:44.000 --> 17:46.000]  that is the opposite of their dystopia.
[17:47.000 --> 17:50.000]  It's that choice, it's that realization that's going to change the world.
[17:51.000 --> 17:54.000]  And it's the only choice we've got, freedom or slavery go to evil.
[17:54.000 --> 17:58.000]  It is a spiritual battle and info wars at the tip of the spear fighting it.
[17:59.000 --> 18:06.000]  The most important thing I've done in the last eight years for my health, for my middle clarity, for my focus has been deep birth crystal iodine.
[18:07.000 --> 18:14.000]  Dr. Group hammered me and hammered me nine, ten years ago and said Alex you've got to start taking deep birth crystal atomic iodine
[18:15.000 --> 18:17.000]  and when I finally started taking it, it changed my life.
[18:17.000 --> 18:26.000]  Even the UN's own health website admits over two million people have cognitive disabilities lower IQ because of lack of iodine.
[18:27.000 --> 18:31.000]  Well we have two varieties of high quality iodine that will blow you away on sale right now.
[18:32.000 --> 18:35.000]  X2 is the deep breath crystal iodine and X3 is the cry iodine.
[18:36.000 --> 18:40.000]  Deep breath crystal iodine and two other types, just some people need all three types for formation.
[18:41.000 --> 18:44.000]  Two tappels and oranges, two different formulas, some of them like one better or the other.
[18:44.000 --> 18:47.000]  But the point is they're all discounted right now.
[18:48.000 --> 18:54.000]  Fifty percent off for X2, sixty percent off for X3, with pre-shipping, double patriot points through the fourth of July.
[18:54.000 --> 19:14.000]  Running out of X3, so get your orders in now at 4store.com.
[19:30.000 --> 19:35.000]  Welcome back folks, I was ranting and raving here on the Alexio Show last week about Joe Boudin as a popular podcaster.
[19:36.000 --> 19:44.000]  Attacking me based on saying I'm a KKK guy, I'm a racist, and Andrew Schultz, a popular comedian shouldn't have me on his show.
[19:45.000 --> 19:51.000]  And I said burn in hell, he's not as bad as Bill Gates or people like that, so I take that back and I repent of that.
[19:51.000 --> 19:55.000]  I hope his bad ideas burn though, because it's a lie.
[19:56.000 --> 20:07.000]  And I really realize that we're all in this together, but I will not sit there and have racist black people who are feeding at the corporate New World Order, eugenics, death cult, genocide, debt.
[20:08.000 --> 20:17.000]  Lecture me about how I'm bad because I'm white, just because you are this black person paid by the corporate media to spew racism to divide this country and the world.
[20:17.000 --> 20:28.000]  I didn't do anything to you, I don't owe you anything, and you are despicable lying about me while they are starving the third world to death, particularly Africa.
[20:29.000 --> 20:33.000]  And I have empathy for those Africans, because I know what they're doing to them, they're going to do to me.
[20:35.000 --> 20:42.000]  And I don't see a damn thing being said by all the trendy black leaders about what's happening with the starving of the third world.
[20:42.000 --> 20:50.000]  I don't care what color you are, you should understand that the lockdown is a major crime against humanity, and they're trying to bring it back in.
[20:51.000 --> 20:56.000]  The UN saying wear mask again, the vaccines don't work, oh there's new variants, because it's a cold virus.
[20:57.000 --> 21:05.000]  And they're keeping lockdowns in India and Africa that are starving millions of people who don't get enough to eat, so regular viruses kill them.
[21:05.000 --> 21:15.000]  This isn't a game, it's not a joke, it's real. And all these spoiled, rotten black people, Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter, sit here in what's left of America.
[21:16.000 --> 21:29.000]  Going along with the corporate tune that white people are inherently bad, while the very corporations running the world that just so happened to be run by a lot of rich Asians and white people, there's some black folks on board.
[21:29.000 --> 21:35.000]  Look at Tetris, Tetris of the, Tedris of the WHO, total eugenicist.
[21:36.000 --> 21:49.000]  And they're establishing these contact tracing teams all over the world and going and grabbing people they claim didn't allow a vaccine or didn't do their PCR test and disappearing them into government facilities.
[21:49.000 --> 22:03.000]  That's called martial law and they're setting the precedent and now Biden has announced these rapid reaction forces for the quote delta variant plus response teams across the U.S.
[22:04.000 --> 22:11.000]  To communities with low vaccination rates to come to your door and start setting the precedent that they're coming to your door.
[22:11.000 --> 22:31.000]  This is the coverage and the cover for their takeover and the UN has said they want the power to come and take you out of your house and disappear you and they've set up in Canada and other areas, Spain, Germany, France, the UK, Australia everywhere.
[22:31.000 --> 22:41.000]  Where when you land from out of the country you spend 14 days locked in your hotel room, not even allowed out and if you complain, well they put you in prison.
[22:42.000 --> 22:52.000]  But oh government officials and footballers and movie stars, they can get a special government allotment and a little chip card they carry and they're allowed to circumvent that.
[22:52.000 --> 23:08.000]  True discrimination, a new ruling class that is able to circumvent the law and put an oppressive digital medical tyranny martial law ID on us that they exempt themselves from.
[23:08.000 --> 23:26.000]  And I even played last week help try to find it again guys. The member of the British parliament who's on the government regulatory board and again he was on national television and said well of course important people aren't going to be restricted.
[23:27.000 --> 23:28.000]  It's 99% of all you.
[23:28.000 --> 23:41.000]  You see the seduction of that system if you had a checklist for tyranny they've checked every one of the boxes off this is classic evil classic martial law with a high tech system of control.
[23:42.000 --> 23:56.000]  So here is the head of the UN program a year ago saying we're going to come in your houses we're going to take your families away from you and now Biden is setting up the first waves of it and guess who pays for these teams they're private.
[23:56.000 --> 24:09.000]  That's right ladies and gentlemen the bill on the Gates Foundation is taxpayer money and pays for it and it goes to the Clinton global initiative that actually gets billions of dollars from it so they also get rich while they screw us over here at us.
[24:10.000 --> 24:13.000]  The moment in most parts of the world due to lockdown.
[24:13.000 --> 24:26.000]  Most of the transmission that's actually happening in many countries now is happening in the household at family level in some senses transmission has been taken off the streets and pushed back into family units.
[24:27.000 --> 24:37.000]  Now we need to go and look in families to find those people who may be sick and remove them and isolate them in a safe and dignified manner.
[24:37.000 --> 24:50.000]  And then if you're the isolate you solve their confinement and then if you're on the political list they send out their political officers the PCR test says you're positive or if you resist they take it to jail they take it as secret camps.
[24:50.000 --> 25:07.000]  This is we told you about this a year ago now it's confirmed secret camps in Australia secret camps in the UK secret camps in Europe secret camps in Canada and they're passing laws to ban any speech they want and major health ministers in Alberta and other areas are on TV saying we're not letting the
[25:07.000 --> 25:18.000]  we're not letting the martial law ever go away because we're using this to stop people talking on the streets and that's the beyond the Soviet Union people are allowed to talk on the streets but not in Canada.
[25:19.000 --> 25:22.000]  So this is global UN directed martial law here it is.
[25:22.000 --> 25:36.000]  Hi there thanks for taking my questions I'm wondering about the injunction banning public gatherings and whether there really is a need for such a far reaching one given a trajectory we're on now.
[25:36.000 --> 25:53.000]  So I mean I think it's still there we still have the you know bringing large numbers of people together it can present some risk we'll continue to look at that but I think the other purpose of the injunction is to is to.
[25:53.000 --> 26:12.000]  Prevent you know groups that are spreading deliberately spreading false information that connects but I could I see create risk the information itself if listen to creates risk to the public as well so and that's that that certainly is a need to manage that misinformation campaign as well.
[26:12.000 --> 26:22.000]  OK so you can't let people congregate because they might talk about how the ongoing lockdowns a lot and I have articles where.
[26:23.000 --> 26:26.000]  There are islands off Canada where thousands of people live that have never been able to leave for a year and a half.
[26:27.000 --> 26:38.000]  There are small towns in Australia where they can get away with it and the army just surrounds it and says well there's no cases in this town so we might save one person in this town of 3000 people.
[26:38.000 --> 26:45.000]  Or this kind of 800 people in one case if we don't let anyone go in around and it's all just a test of total martial law.
[26:46.000 --> 26:52.000]  But if you're in the government or the military or the police you get a special little card and you're the new superclass.
[26:53.000 --> 27:02.000]  While we're all talking about black versus white all day you know black lives matter is in Russia black lives matter is in Australia black lives matter is in Germany it's in Mexico.
[27:02.000 --> 27:12.000]  It's the corporate system that's given tens of billions of dollars worldwide to say we love black people do what we say corporately to save them.
[27:13.000 --> 27:18.000]  And what is the goal no family and get black men to become women.
[27:19.000 --> 27:23.000]  That's the main oh what a loving group so first they take your identity.
[27:23.000 --> 27:31.000]  Buy off your leaders like Margaret Sanger said 120 years ago her quotes are in the National Archives.
[27:32.000 --> 27:38.000]  She said we're going to kill these human weeds but first we've got to buy off the black leadership and get them under our control then we will speak for the blacks.
[27:39.000 --> 27:41.000]  And she called you human weeds.
[27:41.000 --> 27:53.000]  So there we are ladies and gentlemen I've got big news on the military front the Ashley Babbitt front the latest level in the Sovietization of Facebook and so much more and some big guests today.
[27:54.000 --> 27:55.000]  It's all right.
[27:56.000 --> 28:07.000]  As men age they often experience a slowdown in vitality energy and overall wellness.
[28:07.000 --> 28:13.000]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date.
[28:14.000 --> 28:24.000]  Super male vitality specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality in males.
[28:25.000 --> 28:35.000]  Now look this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[28:35.000 --> 28:36.000]  Yes.
[28:37.000 --> 28:48.000]  We're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this urged packed formula.

[29:57.000 --> 30:03.000]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid April 2021 and I just want to say something.

[30:54.000 --> 30:57.000]  And hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support him for worse.
[30:57.000 --> 31:22.000]  God bless.
[31:22.000 --> 31:42.000]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. until 3 p.m. Central.
[31:43.000 --> 31:48.000]  I am here live in the most band demonized attack broadcast in the world because we are over the enemy target.
[31:48.000 --> 31:54.000]  We know how to stop the globalist. We know how to go to the next level in the human species.
[31:55.000 --> 31:58.000]  We know how to win. So if you want to live, you want to prosper, you want to be a slave.
[31:59.000 --> 32:02.000]  Listen to us. Check out everything we say. Don't believe us. Research it.
[32:03.000 --> 32:07.000]  Now, somebody that says don't research it and just believe us is Tracy Edwards,
[32:08.000 --> 32:12.000]  a commissioner in New York City for Long Island.
[32:13.000 --> 32:16.000]  Remember her six months ago? She said, I don't want to know what's in it.
[32:16.000 --> 32:24.000]  I don't want to ask any questions. Just give me the injection. Here it is.
[32:25.000 --> 32:31.000]  COVID has devastated the state. Long Island continues to be one of the hardest hit regions,
[32:32.000 --> 32:36.000]  especially for our black and brown New Yorkers.
[32:37.000 --> 32:40.000]  We must take the vaccine.
[32:41.000 --> 32:43.000]  Now, I'm going to tell you a personal story. Off script.
[32:43.000 --> 32:53.000]  So today, right after this, I am going to have an infusion and I'm going to have an infusion
[32:54.000 --> 33:00.000]  because I want to make sure that the cancer that was in my body does not return.
[33:01.000 --> 33:10.000]  I'm not asking what's in the infusion. I'm not looking up all of the ingredients in the infusion.
[33:10.000 --> 33:16.000]  I am sticking out my arm and I am taking the infusion.
[33:17.000 --> 33:23.000]  And that's what we have to do. Our communities, is it insulin?
[33:24.000 --> 33:29.000]  That's enough. Oh, which is approved and known. Been around for a hundred years.
[33:30.000 --> 33:34.000]  This is a secret, unapproved program that's been banned all over the world.
[33:34.000 --> 33:42.000]  Here's just some of the headlines today. New study links acute chest pain in male soldiers to mRNA vaccines.
[33:43.000 --> 33:45.000]  They've already put warnings on it so they can make you have a heart attack.
[33:46.000 --> 33:51.000]  Norway to pay compensation for AstraZeneca side effects, heart attacks and strokes.
[33:52.000 --> 33:58.000]  And it goes on and on and on from there. This is just the news today.
[33:58.000 --> 34:05.000]  Look at this headline. British rocker dies from brain hemorrhage two weeks after AstraZeneca injection.
[34:06.000 --> 34:12.000]  Here's another one. New England medical journal. Depopulation alert.
[34:13.000 --> 34:19.000]  Shocking new study reveals COVID vaccine terminates four out of five pregnancies via spontaneous abortions.
[34:20.000 --> 34:24.000]  Or 82% of the women had a miscarriage after they took the damn shot. Wow.
[34:24.000 --> 34:27.000]  I mean, that is some mean ass poison.
[34:28.000 --> 34:31.000]  A woman can take a pretty big dose of arsenic and still keep a baby.
[34:32.000 --> 34:35.000]  A woman can drink bottle of Jack Daniels every day.
[34:36.000 --> 34:38.000]  And 99% of the time she keeps that baby.
[34:39.000 --> 34:41.000]  Might have fetal alcohol syndrome.
[34:42.000 --> 34:45.000]  But you take that shot 82% of the time.
[34:46.000 --> 34:48.000]  Double X in them eyes. Dead baby.
[34:48.000 --> 34:52.000]  Dead baby. Wow.
[34:53.000 --> 34:55.000]  They got a lot of nerve.
[34:56.000 --> 34:57.000]  Yeah, let's show you some of these medical doctors and people.
[34:58.000 --> 34:59.000]  Oh, I'm getting my shot. I'm 35 weeks pregnant.
[35:00.000 --> 35:02.000]  Two weeks later, bye-bye baby.
[35:03.000 --> 35:04.000]  She's proud of it.
[35:07.000 --> 35:09.000]  Absolutely insane.
[35:10.000 --> 35:14.000]  Yeah, I got to show them the article then where she took the shot and then boom, bye-bye baby.
[35:14.000 --> 35:18.000]  So, I mean, I've got stacks of this.
[35:19.000 --> 35:21.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, I mean, here's the damn study right here.
[35:22.000 --> 35:24.000]  We'll just actually show you the study.
[35:25.000 --> 35:26.000]  I'll just the article. Here it is.
[35:27.000 --> 35:29.000]  Findings of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine study in pregnant persons.
[35:30.000 --> 35:31.000]  New England Medical Journal.
[35:32.000 --> 35:33.000]  82% death rate.
[35:35.000 --> 35:37.000]  I mean, hell, a rattlesnake only kills you.
[35:38.000 --> 35:39.000]  Let me guess.
[35:40.000 --> 35:42.000]  What percentage of rattlesnake bites are fatal?
[35:42.000 --> 35:43.000]  Maybe 5%.
[35:44.000 --> 35:47.000]  I remember reading a study years ago that water moccasins kill more people in the U.S.
[35:48.000 --> 35:49.000]  than rattlesnakes.
[35:50.000 --> 35:51.000]  Guys, type in, just see the national statistic.
[35:52.000 --> 35:54.000]  Percentage of people bitten by rattlesnake to die.
[35:55.000 --> 35:56.000]  I bet it's 5%.
[35:57.000 --> 35:58.000]  I bet it's less than 10%.
[35:59.000 --> 36:01.000]  But you take the shot, 82% chance your baby is dead.
[36:03.000 --> 36:04.000]  Oh, but I forgot.
[36:06.000 --> 36:10.000]  They got big national talk show hosts saying I'm in the KKK with no evidence.
[36:10.000 --> 36:11.000]  Oh, don't listen to him.
[36:12.000 --> 36:13.000]  Take your shot here in the KKK.
[36:14.000 --> 36:16.000]  They're like, what does that have to do with the KKK?
[36:17.000 --> 36:18.000]  That I don't want to be in lockdowns and forced inoculations.
[36:19.000 --> 36:24.000]  Well, I've got the national strategy for countering domestic terrorism right here.
[36:25.000 --> 36:28.000]  Put out two weeks ago, and it says you are a white supremacist,
[36:29.000 --> 36:32.000]  and then they call that terrorism if you don't want lockdowns or forced inoculations.
[36:33.000 --> 36:34.000]  Says it right here.
[36:36.000 --> 36:38.000]  And if you're that 80% of Republicans that question the election,
[36:38.000 --> 36:40.000]  says you're a terrorist right here, too.
[36:42.000 --> 36:43.000]  Let me show you.
[36:44.000 --> 36:48.000]  I probably showed you 10 times, but I can show you on the page again.
[36:49.000 --> 36:50.000]  I guess they reprinted it for me.
[36:50.000 --> 36:51.000]  This is not my highlighted copy.
[36:54.000 --> 36:55.000]  Oh, yes, the threat assessment section.
[36:55.000 --> 36:56.000]  Yes, that's it.
[36:57.000 --> 36:58.000]  Let me show you that.
[36:59.000 --> 37:03.000]  They put it on screen for you because this is a declaration of war against the American people.
[37:03.000 --> 37:09.000]  Oh, wow, only 0.2% out of 500 venomous snake bites result in death.
[37:10.000 --> 37:11.000]  I guess that's because of the treatment standing about them.
[37:12.000 --> 37:13.000]  Okay, so see.
[37:14.000 --> 37:18.000]  So see how many times more dangerous is an mRNA shot to a baby and its mother?
[37:19.000 --> 37:23.000]  Guys, average 0.2 into 82%.
[37:23.000 --> 37:35.000]  I mean, I think it's fair to say hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times safer to be bit by a rattlesnake than it is to take the COVID vaccine if you're a baby.
[37:35.000 --> 37:52.000]  Oh, but don't worry, they got liberals lined up around the block to give their newborn babies the injection in an experimental program because they want to virtue signal what heroes they are because they have no damn common sense.
[37:55.000 --> 37:56.000]  All right, I mentioned it.
[37:56.000 --> 37:57.000]  So let's play it.
[37:57.000 --> 38:08.000]  We got lots of new news, but I don't want to just say there's a member of parliament and a major medical advisor to the government saying, well, of course, famous people aren't going to have to be quarantined when they come to the country like footballers or people.
[38:09.000 --> 38:10.000]  Again, and this is the model for the world.
[38:11.000 --> 38:16.000]  What you see in the UK, what you see in Canada is for us next, if we put up with it, we just aren't as sheepish.
[38:17.000 --> 38:20.000]  I'm sorry, as the folks living in the UK or Canada, but they're getting us lined up for it.
[38:21.000 --> 38:21.000]  Here it is.
[38:22.000 --> 38:24.000]  Davis has called that morally inconsistent.
[38:24.000 --> 38:37.000]  Well, we've always said that for some people who are important to players, for instance, we have special terms and these are what you're saying.
[38:38.000 --> 38:39.000]  No, of course not.
[38:39.000 --> 38:46.000]  But we're talking, you know, we're talking a very limited number of people who are coming in and they're also subject still to quite significant restrictions.
[38:46.000 --> 38:48.000]  They're not just able to come in and travel around Britain.
[38:48.000 --> 38:50.000]  They come in to attend.
[38:50.000 --> 38:52.000]  Oh, yeah, that's an observation, gentlemen.
[38:52.000 --> 38:57.000]  So imagine if you could say no freedom till every COVID case in the world is eradicated.
[38:57.000 --> 38:58.000]  That's impossible.
[38:58.000 --> 39:01.000]  Set up for a UN, global government power grab.
[39:01.000 --> 39:03.000]  And I told you, it'll never end.
[39:03.000 --> 39:09.000]  Every time opposition mounts, they will loosen the restrictions some and as soon as opposition dies, clamp back down.
[39:09.000 --> 39:11.000]  And now exactly as I told you, it's happened.
[39:11.000 --> 39:21.000]  This is a permanent, unending emergency, taking your speech, your medical rights and next your money with carbon taxes, which they're now putting in place.
[39:21.000 --> 39:25.000]  They will bankrupt the West even further and complete our journey into slavery.
[39:25.000 --> 39:26.000]  You'll be obsolete.
[39:26.000 --> 39:27.000]  You'll be non-essential.
[39:27.000 --> 39:28.000]  You'll have no job.
[39:28.000 --> 39:35.000]  They'll be able to dictate to you to take deadly poison inoculations or you will not get your universal income.
[39:35.000 --> 39:36.000]  That is the plan.
[39:36.000 --> 39:41.000]  Make you obsolete, make you a captive, make you under their control.
[39:41.000 --> 39:43.000]  Have you tried to organize against it?
[39:43.000 --> 39:44.000]  You're a white supremacist.
[39:44.000 --> 39:46.000]  You're like, that doesn't have any logic.
[39:46.000 --> 39:48.000]  Well, what does the new Logitech ad say?
[39:48.000 --> 39:51.000]  With little nos, it's time to stop logic.
[39:51.000 --> 39:53.000]  It's time to stop being logical.
[39:53.000 --> 39:54.000]  Suspend your own common sense.
[39:54.000 --> 39:57.000]  Let us kill you.
[39:57.000 --> 39:59.000]  So that's the plan here, ladies and gentlemen.
[39:59.000 --> 40:04.000]  And it's absolutely, completely out of control.
[40:04.000 --> 40:07.000]  Separately, we can save the planet.
[40:07.000 --> 40:08.000]  We can defeat the globalists.
[40:08.000 --> 40:09.000]  We've got to beat them now.
[40:09.000 --> 40:11.000]  We've got to expose them now.
[40:11.000 --> 40:13.000]  Record low numbers have taken their poison shot.
[40:13.000 --> 40:14.000]  People are waking up everywhere.
[40:14.000 --> 40:17.000]  The globalists are really concerned and they admit they are.
[40:17.000 --> 40:19.000]  They hit us with everything they've got.
[40:19.000 --> 40:20.000]  This is their takeover.
[40:20.000 --> 40:21.000]  This is their world government.
[40:21.000 --> 40:22.000]  This is their medical ID.
[40:22.000 --> 40:24.000]  This is their implantable microchip plan.
[40:24.000 --> 40:26.000]  The Klaus Schwab says, is the plan.
[40:26.000 --> 40:27.000]  You say, we don't want the plan.
[40:27.000 --> 40:28.000]  They go, Jones is crazy.
[40:28.000 --> 40:29.000]  He says they want to put chips in you.
[40:29.000 --> 40:34.000]  Next up on 60 Minutes, everybody's going to have chips.
[40:34.000 --> 40:35.000]  So it's here.
[40:35.000 --> 40:37.000]  You're in the year 2021.
[40:37.000 --> 40:39.000]  Everything accelerates from here on.
[40:39.000 --> 40:40.000]  Submission is death.
[40:40.000 --> 40:42.000]  Resistance is life.
[40:42.000 --> 40:44.000]  Submitting the tyranny is death.
[40:44.000 --> 40:46.000]  Resisting tyranny is life.
[40:46.000 --> 40:49.000]  You have nothing to lose but fighting back.
[40:49.000 --> 40:51.000]  Nothing to lose but stop hearing what they say.
[40:51.000 --> 40:54.000]  Nothing to lose unless you roll over.
[40:54.000 --> 40:55.000]  Then you will be annihilated.
[40:55.000 --> 40:57.000]  Stay with us.
[40:57.000 --> 41:04.000]  Hydrofluorolytic acid is an electrified form of fluoride.
[41:04.000 --> 41:08.000]  Now microscopic amounts of calcium fluoride are needed for our bodies
[41:08.000 --> 41:09.000]  and are good for us.
[41:09.000 --> 41:12.000]  But tiny amounts, a lot of it's deadly poison.
[41:12.000 --> 41:16.000]  But hydrofluorolytic acid is electrified.
[41:16.000 --> 41:20.000]  It's one of the most deadly toxic poisons on the planet.
[41:20.000 --> 41:23.000]  And since the late 1940s, a little gift from the New World Order,
[41:23.000 --> 41:26.000]  they've been putting it in our water to annihilate our DNA,
[41:26.000 --> 41:30.000]  twist our chromosomes, and lower our IQs and fertility.
[41:30.000 --> 41:35.000]  Well, there has to be a good halogen and it's called iodine.
[41:35.000 --> 41:39.000]  And we happen to have the highest quality formulas of iodine
[41:39.000 --> 41:40.000]  available anywhere.
[41:40.000 --> 41:43.000]  We have to have a DEA license in our manufacturer just to put out
[41:43.000 --> 41:46.000]  the deep-earned crystals that are in X2 and X3,
[41:46.000 --> 41:49.000]  both of which are discounted through the Fourth of July.
[41:49.000 --> 41:52.000]  The double-patria points and free shipping, 50% off for X2.
[41:52.000 --> 41:55.000]  60% off for X3 and X3 selling out?
[41:55.000 --> 41:59.000]  Take advantage of it now.
[41:59.000 --> 42:01.000]  The globalists are having their revolution,
[42:01.000 --> 42:04.000]  but free humanity has to have its revolution.
[42:04.000 --> 42:09.000]  We have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers
[42:09.000 --> 42:15.000]  trying to enslave the entire biological processes of humans
[42:15.000 --> 42:22.000]  and turn us into these artificial corporate controlled slaves.
[42:22.000 --> 42:27.000]  Orson slaves, just property from cradle to grave of the system,
[42:27.000 --> 42:31.000]  rendered down to be servile minions of the system
[42:31.000 --> 42:34.000]  and a ritual of dominance and satanic control.
[42:34.000 --> 42:38.000]  We have to recognize the great reset post-industrial world
[42:38.000 --> 42:40.000]  that realizes a nightmare dystopia,
[42:40.000 --> 42:42.000]  and we have to promote liberty and freedom
[42:42.000 --> 42:44.000]  that is the opposite of their dystopia.
[42:44.000 --> 42:46.000]  It's that choice.
[42:46.000 --> 42:48.000]  It's that realization that's going to change the world.
[42:48.000 --> 42:52.000]  And it's the only choice we've got, freedom or slavery,
[42:52.000 --> 42:53.000]  go to evil.
[42:53.000 --> 42:54.000]  It is a spiritual battle.
[42:54.000 --> 43:19.000]  And in full wars at the tip of the spear fighting it.
[43:19.000 --> 43:24.000]  I'm going to talk about how to do this.
[43:24.000 --> 43:29.000]  For your whole body, 50% off, ultimate oil, 40% off,

[45:02.000 --> 45:05.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[45:05.000 --> 45:10.000]  Before you slip into unconsciousness,
[45:10.000 --> 45:16.000]  I'd like to have another kiss,
[45:16.000 --> 45:21.000]  another flashing chance.
[45:21.000 --> 45:26.000]  Listen, I'm not going to let you go.
[45:26.000 --> 45:31.000]  Listen, I'm not going to let you go.
[45:31.000 --> 45:35.000]  Listen, listen, listen
[45:35.000 --> 45:38.000]  Alright, let me lay out some major truths that are very very simple,
[45:38.000 --> 45:43.000]  but are earth shattering if you understand them and apply them.
[45:43.000 --> 45:46.000]  The globalists are collapsing the world economy.
[45:46.000 --> 45:51.000]  The family, our health, our institutions by design,
[45:51.000 --> 45:55.000]  because they don't want an upwardly mobile, egalitarian,
[45:55.000 --> 46:03.360]  Classically liberal free open society, so they have to pose as the liberals to control all those classical Christian inspired
[46:04.400 --> 46:06.240]  institutions
[46:06.240 --> 46:09.680]  Liberal means a bigger swimming pool a nicer college
[46:10.080 --> 46:16.680]  More food to eat more libraries and just using classic definition liberal means less censorship
[46:17.400 --> 46:22.960]  Liberal means more guns more self-defense liberal means nicer living accommodations
[46:22.960 --> 46:26.040]  The problem is it creates decadent dumb dumb people
[46:26.040 --> 46:33.240]  It is a cycle and what comes at the end of the cycle is absolute tyranny mass die-off and extermination and the globalists understand
[46:33.240 --> 46:35.840]  That so they've decided to artificially accelerate that
[46:37.240 --> 46:39.240]  Instead of having giant wars
[46:39.880 --> 46:41.640]  Where we all kill each other
[46:41.640 --> 46:45.640]  They're going to have the globalist corporate system direct new types of war
[46:46.640 --> 46:48.640]  psychological cultural
[46:48.760 --> 46:50.760]  financial
[46:50.760 --> 46:53.120]  To basically poison and kill us slowly and
[46:54.120 --> 47:02.000]  So they bake it into the cake. They it's a little taste to Armageddon to quote the old 1960s Star Trek piece and
[47:03.920 --> 47:06.780]  That's where we are a little taste to Armageddon
[47:07.320 --> 47:12.360]  But it's a lot more than a little taste and they've written thousands of books admitting all this
[47:12.360 --> 47:18.680]  That's what's so frustrating is people keep thinking like oh you tuned on Alex Jones. You're getting his perspective
[47:18.680 --> 47:20.680]  You're getting his view
[47:22.240 --> 47:24.240]  When it comes to the big issues
[47:24.760 --> 47:30.960]  No, we're dead on we know the globalist program and with every passing day it becomes more their world
[47:31.880 --> 47:34.480]  It becomes more their system
[47:36.040 --> 47:40.720]  Do we have a total world government or do we have a total technocracy do we have a total eugenics program?
[47:40.720 --> 47:43.120]  No, but they are in afterburners
[47:43.640 --> 47:45.640]  Blasting us towards it right now
[47:45.640 --> 47:53.360]  Now overhead shop, please a lot of Jeffrey Epstein news is coming up and they always had this virus scare program on the books
[47:53.920 --> 47:57.240]  We've covered that operation lockstep with others crimson contagion
[47:57.240 --> 48:01.920]  But why did they go ahead and pull the trigger because a lot of folks thought this was dangerous. They thought it would backfire
[48:02.080 --> 48:05.560]  Why did they pull this asymmetrical fifth-generational?
[48:06.480 --> 48:09.920]  Warfare operation that has so many blowback problems to it
[48:09.920 --> 48:17.760]  Because internally there were good networks in Europe in the u.s. In South America in Africa in Asia
[48:18.200 --> 48:24.760]  That don't want to go with the evil eugenics model of human extermination and controlled war who wanted prosperity and
[48:26.040 --> 48:30.240]  Trump and others and myself and in you were leading the fight against the
[48:31.160 --> 48:33.160]  globalist model of
[48:33.160 --> 48:39.000]  Of planned destruction instead believing in a laissez-faire pro-human future
[48:40.360 --> 48:46.560]  But under the carbon taxes under the global government they collapse the planet it's simple mathematics
[48:46.560 --> 48:48.560]  They shut down the industries and
[48:49.040 --> 48:51.400]  The third world starts to die in mass
[48:51.600 --> 48:58.560]  Then what's left of them is organized to flood the first world and be organized into political units to be used against us to
[48:58.560 --> 49:00.280]  Finally take down the country
[49:00.280 --> 49:04.760]  That's why the border patrol told us they estimate 10 million people
[49:05.560 --> 49:07.560]  just in the Texas
[49:07.560 --> 49:09.400]  Laredo sector
[49:09.400 --> 49:14.520]  The Rio Grande sector our border with Mexico this year by October
[49:14.520 --> 49:20.840]  That's fiscal year federal year ends in October. They pass the budget and starts over in December
[49:22.600 --> 49:28.920]  That's 10 million that that's bigger than ever came to this country in one year before or in three years in just one sector
[49:28.920 --> 49:35.680]  You go down there. It looks like a giant industrial camp huge tents huge buildings thousands of vehicles
[49:36.360 --> 49:41.160]  Just our government delivering all these people in that the Democrats fully control many of them
[49:41.160 --> 49:46.360]  Don't even know aren't with their parents being smuggled. I mean, it's just mass crime the collapse of the country
[49:47.240 --> 49:50.280]  Illustrated in full blazing neon for you
[49:51.840 --> 49:57.780]  So that's why when AOC said two years ago in 12 years all society will collapse will all be dead
[49:57.780 --> 50:02.020]  When Beto said in 12 years everything will collapse will all be dead
[50:02.820 --> 50:07.580]  They're telling Beto and her in meetings that oh the earth has hit this number
[50:07.580 --> 50:11.980]  We have these computer programs just like in Ron Rand scam programs that show Congress people before
[50:13.020 --> 50:19.620]  They show them these scam computer programs and they actually believe the higher level left not the highest level
[50:19.620 --> 50:27.340]  But the high level actually believe the world's ending and that mass extermination is about to happen because the carrying capacity of the earth died
[50:27.340 --> 50:36.260]  And they tell you oh new viruses are gonna emerge because of the global warming and wipe out billions and giant fires and the third world
[50:36.260 --> 50:42.060]  But all the start of death then they shut off the third world and all the food we import and the flowers
[50:42.260 --> 50:43.380]  Doesn't sound like a big deal
[50:43.380 --> 50:47.980]  But a lot of people survive working on flower farms in Latin America in particular Africa
[50:48.580 --> 50:52.180]  And and and the mining and everything else came to a stop
[50:52.180 --> 50:57.300]  In the average African country 60% of your money spent on food and
[50:58.300 --> 51:04.500]  You don't have a job you starve to death and so them and then AOC says look Africa starving
[51:04.900 --> 51:08.300]  We need to give the UN more money when the UN ran the program to do it
[51:09.100 --> 51:15.460]  Then they organize them and bring them here and they're desperate and they're scared and the UN tells them white people are bad attack them
[51:15.460 --> 51:23.060]  White people deserve to die. No white person's good and the universities are teaching that to then bring in giant groups of desperate people
[51:23.380 --> 51:29.900]  Like a zombie apocalypse to be used to bring down what's left of the West and then the globalist have won. They'll have high-tech
[51:31.420 --> 51:38.020]  Armored corporate reservations with all the luxury all the medicine all the systems and we'll be outside starving to death
[51:39.500 --> 51:43.140]  And now you understand the rest of story so here's Jeffrey Epstein
[51:43.140 --> 51:45.620]  This was all coming out
[51:46.540 --> 51:53.500]  Good forces were exposing worldwide pedophile rings run by criminal elements that had taken over the CIA
[51:55.260 --> 52:00.300]  The Mossad and MI6 and it's well known in England. They run everything off pedophile rings
[52:00.740 --> 52:04.580]  Israel's now run off pedophile rings at the top the US has run off pedophile rings
[52:04.580 --> 52:12.020]  the Vatican's run off pedophile rings and you've got major pedophile rings only three or four of them
[52:12.020 --> 52:16.780]  that are controlling the entire planet right now and
[52:17.580 --> 52:22.020]  So busting these up will bring down their network. So when we started busting their network up
[52:22.380 --> 52:28.780]  They just released their virus did their global lockdown. They already planned and started the planetary countdown to collapse
[52:30.180 --> 52:34.700]  That's why they're accelerating printing all the money now it warped speed and only giving it to themselves
[52:34.700 --> 52:41.820]  So they get value to buy up companies buy up land buy up farmland buy up infrastructure buy up patents buy up what weapon systems?
[52:42.940 --> 52:49.940]  Buy up all their competition to just shut tens of thousands of us and European companies down and just send people home
[52:50.260 --> 52:52.780]  So that they buy the company just to close them
[52:54.220 --> 52:59.740]  Because they're using money as a weapon because they have multiple quadrillions of fake money
[52:59.740 --> 53:04.980]  And so now we've reached that I was talking to one of my lawyers great guy nor baddest up in the Northeast this morning
[53:04.980 --> 53:07.140]  He said he goes the grocery store. It looks like Russia
[53:08.180 --> 53:15.500]  Almost half the shelves are completely empty. There's basic stuff hasn't been there for months because it's a breakdown. It's already beginning
[53:16.260 --> 53:19.980]  The prices are exploding. It's a take down. Look at these articles
[53:19.980 --> 53:27.260]  I have more than 40% of San Franciscans to leave this year. Say the city is deteriorating collapsing. It's a plan
[53:27.260 --> 53:29.460]  They're collapsing everything
[53:30.540 --> 53:37.220]  It's gonna take decades to kill everybody and they're gonna reorganize after it's all over. You better get ready people. I
[53:40.980 --> 53:44.260]  Got my last offer a year ago from the globalist to stop now
[53:44.780 --> 53:49.780]  They were gonna have to get me. I don't know what that means indictment are being killed
[53:49.780 --> 53:52.820]  I can't sign on to Satanism and starving is only everybody
[53:52.820 --> 53:57.540]  But as I watch the ship go down, I'll see the black face of the new world order
[53:57.780 --> 54:03.900]  Which they use the new order foot black face on saying look all our spokesperson are black do what we say we're black
[54:05.060 --> 54:09.820]  And I'll get to be criticized as the whole human ship goes down by the black
[54:10.580 --> 54:14.100]  Talk show host declaring how wonderful everything is now. It's a black planet
[54:15.180 --> 54:17.180]  Isn't that sick?
[54:17.500 --> 54:20.820]  But I'm gonna fly it on to the end. We got some good news. It's a bad news
[54:20.820 --> 54:27.660]  People are really listening to us about x2 and x3 the deep earth halogen deep earth crystals highest quality iodine two different

[54:58.140 --> 55:04.140]  Three that again is gonna end on Sunday x2. We've got a decent amount, but current sales rate

[58:02.620 --> 58:07.740]  And the stab a-blown in this sharpened paint that I may never say
[58:08.580 --> 58:13.180]  You might say that I was taking it hard that you wrote me off with a call
[58:13.660 --> 58:18.860]  But don't you wait here that'll hide the sorrow when I may break right down and bone

[58:53.940 --> 58:58.900]  And you want to call in and you disagree you'll go to the head of the line buster
[58:59.300 --> 59:03.740]  Just have a real point to make the clear telephone. You'll be on air. So I'm calling your bluff
[59:04.380 --> 59:08.540]  The whole free number to join us is 877-789-2539
[59:09.340 --> 59:15.100]  877-789-2539 in fact first-time callers any subject you want
[59:15.100 --> 59:21.460]  But people that disagree go to the head of the line eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine
[59:22.300 --> 59:24.300]  I've had a lot of people ask me
[59:24.580 --> 59:30.420]  What I think of the revolver news story about Stuart Rhodes implying he's a federal operative or something
[59:30.420 --> 59:35.660]  I've known Stuart eleven years or so. I think he's done a lot of great work. I like the mission of Oath Keepers
[59:36.340 --> 59:40.900]  And he was even did a law work for Rob do and won a case for Rob do that was
[59:40.900 --> 59:46.020]  I went Rob got tortured and beat up by the police covering an event in Pittsburgh
[59:46.660 --> 59:51.780]  And the details of that Rob never told me how much money you got but it was a decent amount for what happened to him
[59:52.180 --> 59:58.500]  So your roads have been a lawyer everything. I don't I don't think that Stuart Rhodes is a fed
[1:00:00.300 --> 1:00:04.940]  That said though when you get into anything that's got tens of thousands of members
[1:00:04.940 --> 1:00:11.560]  You're going to have infiltrators in that organization, and then it becomes well, don't say that you're criticizing the organization
[1:00:11.940 --> 1:00:17.820]  I mean, I've got a hundred and something crew members and we've been infiltrated before we've been infiltrated and
[1:00:18.740 --> 1:00:21.340]  They just immediately start getting data
[1:00:21.740 --> 1:00:26.340]  Twisting things lying about you going to the press and luckily they always reveal themselves pretty quick
[1:00:26.780 --> 1:00:30.260]  But I think the first revolver story about the feds provocative turning is excellent
[1:00:30.260 --> 1:00:34.260]  I think the guy that wrote it means well, and I think it's important questions
[1:00:34.260 --> 1:00:36.060]  for
[1:00:36.060 --> 1:00:41.180]  You know Stuart to answer those questions and and and to really flesh that out
[1:00:41.780 --> 1:00:46.100]  As to why so many innocent oathkeepers that didn't do anything or in jail
[1:00:46.660 --> 1:00:53.580]  And then Stuart isn't but they're calling person one. They're probably arguing it up arresting. So and I hope that's not the case. So
[1:00:54.780 --> 1:00:59.700]  I'm going to interview Stuart because I'm taping the Sunday show and watch the probably a war or something
[1:00:59.700 --> 1:01:05.360]  So I'll be in live, but for the July Sunday. I'm going to take office for the July. I'm taping with Stuart today
[1:01:06.060 --> 1:01:10.980]  And he'll have two segments three four whatever he wants. Tell me once the whole show he can have it
[1:01:11.460 --> 1:01:14.340]  You know to just to talk about the capital January 6
[1:01:14.780 --> 1:01:17.580]  The whole thing is gonna be about the revolver story the second part
[1:01:17.980 --> 1:01:22.380]  I talked to revolver guy, and I said I'd like to see one about CNN and Antifa
[1:01:23.020 --> 1:01:26.540]  And the Democrats wrote that big article in Time Magazine about how they basically
[1:01:26.540 --> 1:01:32.980]  Tricked us at the Capitol and use mob psychology. He said he is working on that. So and I'm trying to get that guy on too
[1:01:33.980 --> 1:01:38.620]  Well, frankly what I'd like to do is see the two guys debate each other because that's that's always interesting
[1:01:38.620 --> 1:01:41.140]  But Stuart Rhodes is gonna be interviewed
[1:01:41.860 --> 1:01:43.960]  By me today also judge Joe Brown
[1:01:44.820 --> 1:01:47.380]  I'm gonna be interviewing judge Joe Brown today and
[1:01:48.260 --> 1:01:54.540]  That's be such a powerful interview. I'm probably just gonna put that out Saturdays its own broadcast and then I'm not air some pieces of it
[1:01:54.540 --> 1:01:57.980]  I might I will he's always a great guest
[1:01:58.300 --> 1:02:03.180]  He'll be talking about everything that's going on the race-based politics Bill Cosby all the rest of it
[1:02:03.180 --> 1:02:05.020]  that is coming up too and
[1:02:05.020 --> 1:02:08.900]  So I'm interviewing judge Brown. I'm gonna be up here till eight o'clock tonight
[1:02:09.420 --> 1:02:13.940]  Doing a whole bunch of interviews and I just thought hey, why not just knock out a bunch of them
[1:02:13.940 --> 1:02:19.420]  So I think I got five people I'm interviewing today. So look for that Saturday
[1:02:19.420 --> 1:02:26.020]  Look for that on the Sunday show. I might just put out Rhodes and judge Joe Brown and a bunch of others
[1:02:26.020 --> 1:02:33.740]  It's maybe a commercial three three four hour baby tomorrow on Saturday and then get it it down and air it on the Sunday show
[1:02:33.740 --> 1:02:36.660]  I don't know but that's coming up and
[1:02:37.700 --> 1:02:40.500]  So much more and then of course the Monday transmission

[1:04:05.740 --> 1:04:08.420]  You're listening to Alex Jones
[1:04:08.420 --> 1:04:12.220]  Oh, this magic moment
[1:04:12.220 --> 1:04:17.180]  Oh, so different and so you
[1:04:28.420 --> 1:04:30.860]  You took me by surprise
[1:04:30.860 --> 1:04:39.860]  I knew that you felt it too for some of that voice
[1:04:45.060 --> 1:04:48.580]  Info voice just a little bit over the edge
[1:04:48.580 --> 1:05:01.100]  We're not supposed to be on air at this point we're supposed to be off the air a long time ago the global for supposed to have air
[1:05:01.980 --> 1:05:08.180]  superiority to carry out their race war in their bio war on us, but humanity is awake and is fighting back
[1:05:09.060 --> 1:05:13.380]  All right, Mike Adams is always on fire. He's particularly in Fuego
[1:05:14.020 --> 1:05:16.300]  What is the Latin for fire on fire?
[1:05:16.300 --> 1:05:20.420]  But he really just vacuum cleaners up all the key information
[1:05:21.020 --> 1:05:24.700]  It's like half the time he's the guy that has it first in this case. It was life-size news
[1:05:24.700 --> 1:05:31.860]  But he went and did even more research on it and just blew me away his articles at natural is calm and on info wars calm
[1:05:31.860 --> 1:05:37.060]  And that's the New England medical journal finding that 82% of women that took
[1:05:37.060 --> 1:05:45.340]  The mRNA vaccines Pfizer or Moderna had miscarriages of their babies. That is just I
[1:05:46.260 --> 1:05:54.140]  Mean, I thought it was bombshell five weeks ago when they had testimony in Congress that half the CDC doctors and scientists won't take the COVID vaccines
[1:05:55.420 --> 1:05:59.340]  But I mean 82% miscarriages Wow and
[1:06:00.220 --> 1:06:05.220]  Now they've got inserts saying it can make you have a heart attack particularly young people
[1:06:05.220 --> 1:06:09.300]  And I know people who've been in divorces
[1:06:10.180 --> 1:06:13.340]  Where some of the children live here the others live there and the father
[1:06:14.620 --> 1:06:17.100]  Here's from the mother. Oh, we're gonna give our daughter
[1:06:18.660 --> 1:06:24.220]  The shot and the father calls up and says well their children aren't even in danger of COVID and
[1:06:25.140 --> 1:06:28.340]  It's also experimental and a lot of scientists. They don't give it to children in the UK
[1:06:28.340 --> 1:06:32.060]  They don't give it to people under 16. It's like I'm gonna do it
[1:06:32.060 --> 1:06:36.100]  And it's all like a little mini form of human sacrifice
[1:06:36.260 --> 1:06:42.940]  Our moonshows and by proxy to abuse their daughters and their sons like this and I see the headlines and you know the oh
[1:06:43.380 --> 1:06:50.700]  The couples I'm seeing in oh, we're giving it to our six-month-old baby. It's not even approved for emergency
[1:06:52.700 --> 1:06:54.020]  Authorization
[1:06:54.020 --> 1:06:59.340]  It's so and the scientists are like mainline scientists that we're going to do not give it to your baby
[1:06:59.340 --> 1:07:03.420]  No, no, please don't do that. That we're doing it. We're liberal
[1:07:04.020 --> 1:07:06.020]  oh
[1:07:06.660 --> 1:07:09.420]  They don't want contact football and oh
[1:07:10.220 --> 1:07:15.380]  They don't want tag at school. That's been banned for a decade all the country. Oh, they don't want dodgeball
[1:07:15.380 --> 1:07:20.500]  That's mean. Oh, they don't want winners and losers. They don't they want fuzzy math because you might hurt somebody's feelings
[1:07:20.500 --> 1:07:24.700]  How about you might hurt somebody's brain giving them a deadly injection?
[1:07:24.700 --> 1:07:28.620]  So the whole pedophile new world order ring system
[1:07:29.460 --> 1:07:35.940]  Was in so much trouble and it was all coming out and there were patriots in corporations and in government and all over
[1:07:37.700 --> 1:07:39.700]  that
[1:07:39.740 --> 1:07:44.020]  We're fighting back and there's been a whole bunch of FBI agents busted by good FBI agents
[1:07:44.020 --> 1:07:48.980]  You know that are running pedophile rings and all the rest of it. So there's a real civil war inside the government
[1:07:48.980 --> 1:07:53.860]  There's a civil war inside our churches inside our families inside our own minds
[1:07:56.180 --> 1:08:00.740]  And so the globalists just launched their global lockdown on their hysteria to divert us away
[1:08:00.740 --> 1:08:04.140]  So just thinking about be able to go outside or have a job
[1:08:04.980 --> 1:08:12.460]  Instead of talking about Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself. That's all their panic response to what's happening
[1:08:12.460 --> 1:08:16.900]  and the system is in absolute complete panic right now and has been in the process of
[1:08:16.900 --> 1:08:20.180]  Complete panic right now and has struck back with all this
[1:08:21.460 --> 1:08:25.060]  So the toll-free number to join us is 877789 Alex

[1:08:35.260 --> 1:08:40.380]  We have Matt in Florida. We have scooter in Florida. We have Greg in Florida. You know, I started many years ago
[1:08:41.220 --> 1:08:46.180]  Or I didn't start it Mark Cornkey really great talk show host of a Michigan smart guy
[1:08:46.180 --> 1:08:51.220]  He started the the best I could tell let me somebody else to the first person I ever had or do it was
[1:08:51.660 --> 1:08:58.460]  Mark Cornkey and he would do it on his his his shortwave show was also on some radio stations was on right here in Austin and
[1:08:59.100 --> 1:09:01.020]  he would
[1:09:01.020 --> 1:09:04.860]  Have callers calling and say what FEMA region they lived in because you know under
[1:09:05.180 --> 1:09:08.220]  Bidens declared emergency and under the open borders and all this
[1:09:08.740 --> 1:09:13.620]  America is under an emergency. We're under a FEMA emergency. So you're really not in Texas
[1:09:13.620 --> 1:09:18.780]  You're really not in Maine. You're really not in California. You're in your FEMA region and
[1:09:19.420 --> 1:09:22.140]  So it's it's it's it's it's it's healthy
[1:09:22.860 --> 1:09:28.500]  To know what FEMA region you're in to start getting your mind wrapped around what's really going on
[1:09:29.260 --> 1:09:31.760]  And it's under that emergency
[1:09:32.420 --> 1:09:36.860]  But they think they can get away with whatever they want, but just take a look at Jeffrey Epstein right here
[1:09:38.020 --> 1:09:39.420]  Jeffrey Epstein's
[1:09:39.420 --> 1:09:43.600]  20,000 acre Zorro Ranch in New Mexico is listed for
[1:09:44.620 --> 1:09:46.620]  27.5 million
[1:09:47.340 --> 1:09:54.380]  And he was basically given the property by the state of New Mexico because he's a government officer carrying on a cloning operation at that base
[1:09:56.780 --> 1:09:58.780]  There's a new video out we'll play here in a moment
[1:09:58.980 --> 1:10:06.780]  Reporter confuses Bill Clinton as Bill Cosby in hilarious Freudian slip and I'm gonna give you my view with judge Joe Brown interview that I'm doing today
[1:10:06.780 --> 1:10:12.180]  On that a little air again this weekend of what I think about Cosby, but I'll say this
[1:10:12.180 --> 1:10:14.860]  I'm glad that Bill Cosby has been released from prison
[1:10:17.300 --> 1:10:21.860]  Not because I'm a fan of Hollywood not because I don't think Cosby didn't do some weird stuff
[1:10:22.820 --> 1:10:31.180]  But because they did violate his rights and they did lie in a prosecution agreement and the tyranny of corrupt prosecutors
[1:10:31.180 --> 1:10:38.780]  Is more dangerous than Bill Cosby. It's simple. You ever heard of saying better ten guilty men go free than one in this mango to prison?
[1:10:40.140 --> 1:10:43.420]  The majority of those women did it for money in a shakedown
[1:10:43.980 --> 1:10:48.940]  Cosby admitted yeah, I've given women pills when they asked for it before he'd done an agreement to tell the truth
[1:10:48.940 --> 1:10:52.460]  He did it they threw his ass in jail. Was he screwing little kids? No
[1:10:52.980 --> 1:10:59.900]  He had topless dancers who'd worked for decades in the industry up in hotel party rooms with a bunch of men and
[1:10:59.900 --> 1:11:06.780]  And people come into his house and I'm not saying it isn't creepy and I'm not giving women quailudes and I don't like it
[1:11:07.660 --> 1:11:12.540]  I'm just saying to sit there and then violate his rights is violating my rights
[1:11:14.180 --> 1:11:19.220]  And a lot of it is Bill Cosby didn't go along with Oprah Winfrey didn't go along with the whole black lives matter thing
[1:11:19.220 --> 1:11:24.140]  He didn't go along with the whole tear down the father's thing and so they said hell we got something on him
[1:11:24.140 --> 1:11:28.460]  We've had the FBI watching him for 30 years 40 years. He likes women
[1:11:28.460 --> 1:11:31.300]  He's probably had sex with a thousand women
[1:11:32.660 --> 1:11:37.060]  So the King David well, what are we gonna do or is that was Solomon a son did that?
[1:11:37.380 --> 1:11:41.700]  What are we gonna do you without sincastor firstones all I'm saying so
[1:11:43.940 --> 1:11:48.500]  It bill Cosby had given a fair trial and the jury found him guilty of
[1:11:49.500 --> 1:11:51.500]  Giving a woman a pill
[1:11:51.500 --> 1:11:57.300]  Then I say put him in jail, but they violated his rights in the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania
[1:11:57.900 --> 1:12:04.780]  Agreed with that and that's the right thing to do because if you violate somebody's rights, you violate everybody's rights
[1:12:04.780 --> 1:12:08.220]  But now I'm spied on Tucker Carlson spied on
[1:12:09.660 --> 1:12:12.260]  The left says all sex between a man and a woman's rape
[1:12:12.660 --> 1:12:18.740]  But you can have convicted pedophiles that drag clean story time with your child bouncing on their knee and in many cases
[1:12:18.740 --> 1:12:21.300]  They don't even tell the parents. They're coming to the school to do it
[1:12:21.300 --> 1:12:23.300]  So
[1:12:25.060 --> 1:12:31.260]  How many Disney directors have been convicted pedophiles they let direct movies with children and they rape them I say execute
[1:12:32.060 --> 1:12:34.060]  pedophiles that are multiple-time offenders and
[1:12:35.540 --> 1:12:38.620]  So it's like in Scarface where he gets up
[1:12:39.100 --> 1:12:41.980]  He said he's at the restaurant all the rich people and he goes oh, yeah
[1:12:41.980 --> 1:12:46.700]  You need me to point your finger and say there's the bad man. So here point at me. There's the bad man
[1:12:46.700 --> 1:12:48.700]  It's the same thing with Bill Cosby
[1:12:48.700 --> 1:12:53.220]  But everybody got on the whole need to bandwagon oh
[1:12:53.740 --> 1:12:57.140]  Bill Cosby he's the worst devil the world ever saw
[1:12:58.620 --> 1:13:00.620]  And then they send his ass to prison
[1:13:02.020 --> 1:13:06.340]  Out of the violated a prosecution agreement you can't tell somebody
[1:13:08.500 --> 1:13:13.300]  Agree to this agree to that pay these people money and then we're not gonna prosecute you
[1:13:13.300 --> 1:13:18.780]  We're not let these other women testify because they're from 25 30 years ago and
[1:13:21.700 --> 1:13:24.540]  Then go back on that you can't do that
[1:13:25.460 --> 1:13:29.780]  The rule of law the whole country is based on a deals a deal
[1:13:31.300 --> 1:13:35.340]  But we don't see that from today's FBI do we for the federal government or state governments
[1:13:35.340 --> 1:13:40.420]  They're out of control. They're breaking all the rules not getting that that's gonna turn around and burn them in the end
[1:13:40.420 --> 1:13:44.300]  So I think Bill Cosby is an old pervert
[1:13:44.860 --> 1:13:50.340]  And I think Bill Cosby when we know he's won these women wanted money from him. They've been coming around for years
[1:13:50.340 --> 1:13:53.060]  He finally gets sick of it and drug them. I think that's wrong
[1:13:56.180 --> 1:14:02.820]  Your voice counts when you share information be it over the internet or in person it changes the world
[1:14:02.820 --> 1:14:09.180]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular. They know you're angry and now to get around big tech
[1:14:09.180 --> 1:14:13.980]  It's more important than ever that we use every tool. We've got the ladies and gentlemen
[1:14:13.980 --> 1:14:16.700]  If you sign up for our free news and show alerts
[1:14:16.700 --> 1:14:23.420]  You can then take those alerts those articles and those live feeds both the regular shows and special reports and share them with everyone
[1:14:23.420 --> 1:14:26.380]  You know take action now by texting the word news
[1:14:26.380 --> 1:14:41.740]  NEWS to 833-470-0438 that's 833-470-0438 for info or as emergency news alerts or text the word show to 833-470-0438 and receive live show
[1:14:41.740 --> 1:14:50.940]  Notifications take action now rate the chain reaction until others to share those texts get news alerts at 833-470-0438
[1:14:50.940 --> 1:14:58.620]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point. It's very bittersweet
[1:14:59.420 --> 1:15:03.740]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would and now we have a lot of credibility
[1:15:03.740 --> 1:15:06.060]  But I don't care about that. I care about beating the new world order
[1:15:06.620 --> 1:15:08.620]  And it's because we have so much credibility
[1:15:08.620 --> 1:15:13.020]  They can't allow us to stay on air much longer and I don't have time to tell you all the stuff
[1:15:13.020 --> 1:15:15.980]  They're doing to us for a lot of reasons. I can't tell you what's going on
[1:15:15.980 --> 1:15:21.340]  But let's just say this we're going to see this through the end. We're going to stay on air as long as we can
[1:15:21.820 --> 1:15:27.820]  So please pray for us and please buy the products and then for store.com. They're great products plus they fund the operation
[1:15:28.060 --> 1:15:32.860]  So you know unlike other products you can buy. They're still great. Do they fund freedom? No, a lot of them don't
[1:15:33.180 --> 1:15:39.260]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth
[1:15:39.580 --> 1:15:44.380]  That's why the globalists are censoring. They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us from the air
[1:15:44.380 --> 1:15:47.580]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word
[1:15:47.980 --> 1:15:52.620]  Download everything we've done you can find and save it because who knows how long we're going to be on the air
[1:15:52.860 --> 1:15:55.180]  And the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said
[1:15:57.740 --> 1:16:02.460]  The globalists are having their revolution but for humanity has to have its revolution
[1:16:03.260 --> 1:16:05.660]  We have to first recognize this anti-human
[1:16:06.620 --> 1:16:08.620]  takeovers trying to
[1:16:09.420 --> 1:16:12.380]  enslave the entire biological processes of humans
[1:16:12.380 --> 1:16:15.580]  and turn us into these artificial corporate
[1:16:16.700 --> 1:16:18.700]  controlled
[1:16:19.100 --> 1:16:20.620]  slaves
[1:16:20.620 --> 1:16:24.300]  Orson slaves just just property from cradle to grave of the system
[1:16:25.340 --> 1:16:27.340]  Rendered down to be servile
[1:16:28.060 --> 1:16:30.060]  minions of the system and a ritual of
[1:16:30.940 --> 1:16:32.940]  dominance and safety and control
[1:16:32.940 --> 1:16:36.060]  We have to recognize their great reset post-industrial world
[1:16:36.700 --> 1:16:39.660]  That realizes a nightmare dystopia and we have to promote liberty and freedom
[1:16:39.660 --> 1:16:42.140]  And that is the opposite of their dystopia
[1:16:42.860 --> 1:16:45.980]  It's that choice. It's that realization that's going to change the world
[1:16:47.020 --> 1:16:49.020]  And it's the only choice we've got
[1:16:49.260 --> 1:16:51.260]  Freedom or slavery go to evil
[1:16:51.500 --> 1:16:54.700]  It is a spiritual battle and info wars at the tip of the spear fighting it
[1:16:54.700 --> 1:17:06.220]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:17:24.780 --> 1:17:26.700]  Waging war on corruption
[1:17:32.940 --> 1:17:40.780]  Waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[1:17:43.260 --> 1:17:45.980]  We are back broadcasting worldwide on this Friday transmission
[1:17:46.380 --> 1:17:50.220]  Got a big weekend for you coming up with judge joe brown special broadcast
[1:17:50.860 --> 1:17:52.860]  Stewart Rhodes and a bunch of other big guests
[1:17:52.860 --> 1:18:02.300]  Keep watching info wars.com news wars.com band out video. That's how we get the truth out. It's how we win full spectrum resistance
[1:18:02.940 --> 1:18:06.220]  Okay, I said calling if you disagree. I just throw that out there because
[1:18:06.940 --> 1:18:13.660]  Uh, you know, I see people attacking me online and you know saying oh Jones has fake callers and you know all the rest of this stuff
[1:18:14.620 --> 1:18:16.620]  And so I always like to get the calls that disagree
[1:18:16.620 --> 1:18:23.820]  In fact, sometimes we just take calls that do disagree as we can actually get a view into what's happening. A lot of times folks are sarcastic though
[1:18:23.820 --> 1:18:27.340]  They don't really disagree. They just do that to uh to I guess
[1:18:27.980 --> 1:18:29.580]  Get in ahead of the line
[1:18:29.580 --> 1:18:33.420]  But we've got Justin in florida says he disagrees. We got mark in pennsylvania
[1:18:33.980 --> 1:18:35.980]  Says they disagree and then a bunch of other callers
[1:18:36.540 --> 1:18:41.500]  Uh, and I am to be briefed those I want to get to a bunch of people ahead of mike adams with bombshell info next hour
[1:18:41.660 --> 1:18:45.420]  I mean just this covid stuff just gets bigger and crazier and more confirmed
[1:18:45.420 --> 1:18:48.540]  And I'm just hit a point of just speechless us almost
[1:18:49.020 --> 1:18:51.020]  uh, let's go to uh
[1:18:51.420 --> 1:18:56.300]  Justin in florida who disagrees first on this friday edition. Thank you for calling
[1:18:57.260 --> 1:18:58.860]  Hey, alex. How's it going?
[1:18:58.860 --> 1:19:01.500]  Love you man. Love the show. Uh, especially love
[1:19:02.060 --> 1:19:07.740]  I'm the true nation. I died it was because of that but I I had experienced my own personal enlightenment lakening
[1:19:08.380 --> 1:19:14.460]  Um, but I have to um, I have to call you out. Um, I hate doing this because I I don't mind. I love it
[1:19:14.460 --> 1:19:17.900]  I love it. In fact, I'm wrong about a lot of stuff. So tell me what's going on
[1:19:18.460 --> 1:19:23.260]  It's a very complicated dichotomy, which is the new order that we all face
[1:19:23.500 --> 1:19:26.700]  And the thing that I realized that I understand, you know
[1:19:27.500 --> 1:19:32.780]  You got to be real careful the line you walk and I'm not sure whether you're doing it to um avoid
[1:19:34.220 --> 1:19:41.020]  A ridicule or because you're afraid of the uh, the programming that has that the the public is currently under
[1:19:41.020 --> 1:19:45.980]  Um from the mainstream media, but um, you know, you're the most prolific a prolific dot connector
[1:19:46.060 --> 1:19:48.060]  I've I've ever heard in my entire life
[1:19:48.380 --> 1:19:54.300]  But there's one dot that um, you just you never seem to connect or seem to avoid it at all costs
[1:19:54.380 --> 1:20:00.060]  And it's it's the uh, the Zionist dot. I mean, you know, there's Christ that said in the bible synagogue of satan
[1:20:00.060 --> 1:20:05.340]  You know, it's the cobblest which are the new order. That is the one thing that binds them all and you know, keep in mind
[1:20:05.340 --> 1:20:10.460]  I'm Jewish by blood. My family was a rich rich family that's used to different South Americans found at the city of Medellin
[1:20:11.020 --> 1:20:17.100]  My family name is looking at right in between rock child and Rockefeller on the list top top 50 families that run the world
[1:20:17.580 --> 1:20:24.060]  But um, you know, despite that I still cannot um get over the fact that every single one that we talk about george soros
[1:20:24.060 --> 1:20:26.380]  When you're talking about Rockefeller rock child
[1:20:26.860 --> 1:20:32.700]  Bill Gates, they're all cobblest jewish. Now, I don't know what what cobblest means in compare
[1:20:32.860 --> 1:20:34.860]  I mean, I'll tell you this
[1:20:34.860 --> 1:20:38.220]  I try to not make things about what religion people are
[1:20:39.180 --> 1:20:42.300]  And certainly there are a lot of powerful jews and powerful positions around the world
[1:20:42.300 --> 1:20:47.580]  Nobody doubts that I see china as a big dominant force. I remember talking about china buying up four of the big six
[1:20:48.060 --> 1:20:51.020]  Hollywood production companies 10 years ago people didn't know that it happened
[1:20:51.340 --> 1:20:56.460]  They look they're like, oh jones is coming up for the jews saying china bought up hollywood. I mean china did
[1:20:57.100 --> 1:20:59.340]  uh, and so I try to stay out of
[1:21:00.620 --> 1:21:03.900]  You know saying catholics are bad catholics aren't bad and a lot of catholics are good people
[1:21:03.900 --> 1:21:09.260]  The pope is very evil. He's very bad. I attacked the southern poverty law center. You know, it's a big leftist group
[1:21:09.260 --> 1:21:12.460]  I attacked the adl. They're anti-free speech. They're very unamerican
[1:21:12.940 --> 1:21:17.100]  Uh, mark zuckerberg's become anti-free speech on american. I don't attack him because he's a jew
[1:21:17.180 --> 1:21:19.820]  I attack him because he's become a an authoritarian
[1:21:20.300 --> 1:21:24.460]  Uh, and so I have callers on like you that want to you know talk about jews
[1:21:24.540 --> 1:21:28.460]  I mean, that's a that's a real thing that people really enjoy talking about
[1:21:28.860 --> 1:21:30.860]  It's something they really like to get into
[1:21:30.860 --> 1:21:36.060]  Um, and you know, I I see the news saying white people are inherently bad. That's a big hot thing
[1:21:36.700 --> 1:21:41.740]  Uh, you know being pushed by the left and by a lot of jews jewish organizations and last time I checked
[1:21:41.740 --> 1:21:43.740]  I thought jews looked pretty white to me
[1:21:44.140 --> 1:21:47.740]  Uh, and it's what I think is there's a racial fetish by elites
[1:21:48.220 --> 1:21:53.980]  To play groups off against each other according to religion or race and that's used as a divide and conquer mechanism
[1:21:54.060 --> 1:21:56.860]  So I try not to wade into that
[1:21:56.860 --> 1:21:59.980]  So that when I'm being called anti-semitic
[1:22:01.340 --> 1:22:05.420]  Or racist people have a problem saying I've done that
[1:22:05.980 --> 1:22:07.980]  Because I have it. I'm just opposing
[1:22:08.460 --> 1:22:13.580]  The fruits of the new world order. I'm opposing the global government takeover trying to have a big tent for everybody
[1:22:14.060 --> 1:22:17.660]  Uh here and like you said you say you're you know of jewish derivation
[1:22:17.820 --> 1:22:23.340]  I know a lot of jews that are really nice smart people. Um, I also know they're jewish organizations that persecute me
[1:22:23.340 --> 1:22:27.420]  Uh, and and you know, they do that, but I'm not going to get down on their level
[1:22:27.980 --> 1:22:33.340]  And and be racially based or religious based like that and you know, persecute me just because I'm a wasp
[1:22:33.980 --> 1:22:38.300]  Uh, and I guess somebody was mean to their great great granddaddy or something. I I didn't do that
[1:22:38.380 --> 1:22:44.460]  So I'm not going to kind of like be red skull and they can be captain america in that scripting in that narrative
[1:22:45.180 --> 1:22:51.100]  I'm not agreeing to play the part of opposition. I mean, you know, some of the jewish groups are famous for
[1:22:51.100 --> 1:22:57.580]  bombing their own people in spain after world war two and in and in iraq to make a move to israel
[1:22:58.300 --> 1:23:00.300]  You know, uh, that's not very nice
[1:23:00.380 --> 1:23:05.900]  But they so so there's a lot of persecution of jews by jews that want to manage to control jews
[1:23:05.900 --> 1:23:09.260]  But that's not all just you know, there were a lot of jews that radiated
[1:23:09.660 --> 1:23:15.180]  Tens of thousands of little jewish children because they were Sephardic not ashkenazi. That's the ringworm children
[1:23:15.420 --> 1:23:18.540]  You know, that's not nice to radiate jews in some cases to death
[1:23:18.540 --> 1:23:24.620]  Uh, but again, all these countries are radiating their people and doing eugenics because there's an evil force up above it
[1:23:24.780 --> 1:23:30.940]  Whether you live in israel or whether you live in the u.s. They're trying to make us take deadly poison. Whether you live in, you know, uh
[1:23:32.140 --> 1:23:36.780]  chili or whether you live in germany, it's the same global corporate governance that's doing it
[1:23:37.260 --> 1:23:43.500]  Uh, and so that's where I stand. You were able to call in and bring up the whole jewish issue. Just anything else?
[1:23:43.500 --> 1:23:47.660]  Uh, yes, uh, the one thing I one connection that people need to understand is that
[1:23:48.220 --> 1:23:54.140]  Communism would not exist without Judaism all the original bolster picks. They were all jewish call marks
[1:23:54.700 --> 1:23:59.260]  Uh, Stalin led and they're all jewish and if you if you read that letter from books, leave your call marks
[1:23:59.260 --> 1:24:04.460]  It says right there what's playing of communism these jewish people that are that are pushing communists. They don't believe in communism
[1:24:04.460 --> 1:24:10.940]  They're not communists, but they utilize communism as it means for a consolidation of power for top-down control
[1:24:10.940 --> 1:24:15.340]  Sure. Sure. Listen. Listen, Justin. I appreciate your call, but I gotta give these other callers
[1:24:15.340 --> 1:24:20.380]  But just since the segment's almost over. Well, no, I was gonna go back to him. Let him go. I was gonna bring this up
[1:24:22.380 --> 1:24:25.900]  You understand that the whole anti jew group says I'm jewish, right?
[1:24:26.460 --> 1:24:30.220]  I mean, you know that right and I'm not if I was I'd be proud of it. Um
[1:24:30.860 --> 1:24:32.860]  I mean, you understand that right
[1:24:33.340 --> 1:24:36.620]  But you understand that bill gates is not jewish
[1:24:36.620 --> 1:24:40.860]  The last time I checked the Rockefellers were like presbyterian
[1:24:41.660 --> 1:24:45.340]  Um, are there a lot of powerful jews and positions of power like Henry Kissinger. Damn, right?
[1:24:46.060 --> 1:24:49.580]  Did his lieutenant Rothkoff try to hire me? Yeah
[1:24:50.620 --> 1:24:52.620]  Uh, okay. So, yeah
[1:24:52.620 --> 1:24:55.980]  That that's no secret that jews excel at academia and government and all that and all over the place
[1:24:56.940 --> 1:24:58.940]  My issue here with that is
[1:25:00.140 --> 1:25:03.500]  This idea that if you slip and fall in a banana pill a jew did it
[1:25:03.500 --> 1:25:08.860]  Or oh, jones is successful. The jews are backing him. No, my listeners are backing me
[1:25:09.420 --> 1:25:13.500]  And and and my show is backing us. So I I resent
[1:25:14.060 --> 1:25:18.300]  The magic carpet aspect of claiming everybody's a jew
[1:25:18.780 --> 1:25:21.420]  Uh, because you were just listing a bunch of people
[1:25:21.420 --> 1:25:28.060]  That this person's a jew and that person's a jew and jew this jew that and you know, just the bizarreness and I'm not saying you're doing this
[1:25:28.060 --> 1:25:30.060]  But I've I've experienced this
[1:25:30.060 --> 1:25:35.820]  We're going to go to break uh and and and come back. I cover issues. I cover policies that I'm for
[1:25:36.700 --> 1:25:39.260]  And it doesn't matter whether you're jewish or german or chinese
[1:25:39.820 --> 1:25:43.820]  If you agree with those issues, we agree with each other and I think I'm promoting policies that help humanity
[1:25:44.220 --> 1:25:48.540]  I'm pro-human and I try to stay out of the race based stuff. We'll be right back
[1:25:48.460 --> 1:25:50.460]  The world is awakening
[1:25:50.620 --> 1:25:54.620]  The world is beginning to understand the globalist movement
[1:25:54.620 --> 1:26:02.140]  They are discovering the globalist the elites the manipulation the cfr the trilateral commission the bilderberg group the bohemian grove
[1:26:03.020 --> 1:26:05.020]  the club of rome
[1:26:05.580 --> 1:26:08.220]  And so even though it seems like the globalists are winning
[1:26:09.260 --> 1:26:14.860]  The truth is they've had to come out the open to attack human freedom because they're actually losing
[1:26:15.260 --> 1:26:21.260]  We have forced them out in the open. We have forced them to come out of the open
[1:26:21.260 --> 1:26:26.460]  We're losing we have forced them out in the open. So as bad as these times are
[1:26:26.860 --> 1:26:30.860]  A lot of negative things are about to happen realize humanity is winning
[1:26:30.860 --> 1:26:35.500]  You've got to trust in the plan of god and trust in the plan of god's justice
[1:26:35.900 --> 1:26:40.380]  That is invincible. That is ethereal timeless and unstoppable
[1:26:40.700 --> 1:26:47.020]  So don't trust in man trust in god to lead god and director sold and then take action against the globalists and realize
[1:26:47.020 --> 1:26:54.380]  You've got my commitment from alex jones and my crew to you. We will never back down from the globalist and we will never surrender

[1:29:33.020 --> 1:29:35.020]  Okay, we can't spend
[1:29:36.220 --> 1:29:39.180]  Nine minutes for the next caller. We won't get to all these great people
[1:29:39.180 --> 1:29:41.900]  But we're talking to folks that disagree the first that got in
[1:29:42.780 --> 1:29:43.980]  so it's uh
[1:29:43.980 --> 1:29:45.420]  will
[1:29:45.420 --> 1:29:47.420]  Disagrees in california
[1:29:48.300 --> 1:29:52.460]  And and and they're calling in about just wild stuff. Jesus is not the messiah
[1:29:52.460 --> 1:29:55.820]  And you know that that's why I don't do a lot of these disagree calls
[1:29:55.820 --> 1:29:58.300]  And you can always call a disagree, but when I do call for it
[1:29:58.860 --> 1:30:03.420]  I guess I've forgotten it just goes off in the left field, which is fine, but uh
[1:30:05.100 --> 1:30:10.860]  That just gets a little confusing, but okay, uh, we'll go ahead. Jesus is not the messiah. Tell me about this
[1:30:11.900 --> 1:30:17.900]  Hi alex a huge fan obviously and I did an animation of bill gates and you guys played it. So I appreciate that
[1:30:18.460 --> 1:30:20.460]  Oh, we're wearing the pink sweater
[1:30:20.460 --> 1:30:22.460]  Yeah, the pink sweater and you shoot him in the head
[1:30:22.700 --> 1:30:24.700]  I got a I got a strike for that on youtube
[1:30:25.020 --> 1:30:29.980]  But anyhow, yeah, that went a little too far. I don't want to turn him into a martyr
[1:30:30.700 --> 1:30:32.700]  For sure. Absolutely. I totally understand
[1:30:33.580 --> 1:30:36.620]  But yeah, so my point is I'll make it quick
[1:30:37.260 --> 1:30:43.740]  I've been listening to this guy rabbi tovia singer and he's you know exposing the christian church and
[1:30:44.220 --> 1:30:48.620]  How jesus is basically used for money to control people and
[1:30:48.620 --> 1:30:52.220]  And uh, he he he was only a rabbi and there's countless times in the bible
[1:30:52.860 --> 1:30:57.340]  Where he's he's saying the why are you why are you praising me? There's only one and that's the father
[1:30:57.580 --> 1:31:02.460]  So, I mean, that's the only point I wanted to make man. I love what you're doing and we just need to just unite
[1:31:03.020 --> 1:31:08.380]  On the one true god. There's no trinity. There's no buddha. There's no any of this other stuff. It's only one true god
[1:31:08.620 --> 1:31:10.620]  All right, I appreciate your call
[1:31:10.620 --> 1:31:14.860]  So you can see everybody's got access to grind and it always revolves around Judaism
[1:31:14.860 --> 1:31:19.100]  So this is all a rabbi says jesus isn't a messiah the other guy the jews are bad
[1:31:19.500 --> 1:31:24.060]  I mean, it's just it just gives me a headache. But hey, that's fine. We're opening the phones up to see if people disagree about
[1:31:24.860 --> 1:31:30.460]  All these fake callers internet says oh jones has fake callers calling sometimes folks. It's not the case
[1:31:31.180 --> 1:31:36.700]  Uh, we're so real. It's ridiculous. Let's go ahead and talk to mark in pennsylvania who disagrees. Go ahead
[1:31:37.980 --> 1:31:40.620]  New knellix, um, I'll get right to the point
[1:31:40.620 --> 1:31:46.220]  Trump is a globalist. He's a trader. He sold us out and shame on you for supporting him
[1:31:46.540 --> 1:31:51.580]  I'll make my case as to why number one. He did nothing about big tech censorship number two
[1:31:52.140 --> 1:31:58.780]  He's done nothing about george soros number three. He did nothing to stop the riots last year number four
[1:31:59.180 --> 1:32:05.980]  He appointed all swamp creatures a number five. It was trump who pushed through the phase
[1:32:05.980 --> 1:32:11.580]  Vax seems an operation warp speed. It's thanks to trump. We have this genetic code injection
[1:32:11.900 --> 1:32:15.020]  Now if I can have some time I can develop those points
[1:32:15.340 --> 1:32:20.940]  And you never you always gloss over the fact that he gave us operation warp speed in the vax
[1:32:21.100 --> 1:32:27.420]  Well, that's not true. I've been extremely critical of trump with operation warp speed. You must not listen very often
[1:32:27.420 --> 1:32:33.420]  I listen when you know when I can but you know, you know, you say he was a big fan of the warps
[1:32:33.420 --> 1:32:39.980]  I can but you know, you know, you say he was talked into it and stuff. He was misled. You know, I listen to not
[1:32:40.140 --> 1:32:43.020]  Okay, well, I'm not into here's the deal. I'm not into lesser or two evils
[1:32:43.580 --> 1:32:45.900]  And I agree with you. Trump has been disappointing in many ways
[1:32:46.700 --> 1:32:51.020]  Do you not want him to get good republicans elected because you're getting a lot of really good republicans elected?
[1:32:51.500 --> 1:32:55.580]  I am sure don't want democrats elected, but you know, um
[1:32:56.300 --> 1:32:58.300]  You know, because we know what they'll do but you
[1:32:58.300 --> 1:33:02.860]  You know, you know, he could have done something about the big tech censorship
[1:33:02.940 --> 1:33:07.580]  Yeah, because you know, they had those hearings in the fall of 2018 by the time, you know
[1:33:07.660 --> 1:33:11.260]  And you and warloom are been banned already and all the big mark
[1:33:11.260 --> 1:33:13.820]  I gotta say you must not be listening to the show
[1:33:14.540 --> 1:33:19.820]  Now I listen to the show alex. Okay. Well, I've been extremely critical the entire time
[1:33:20.380 --> 1:33:24.140]  of these mRNA vaccines and I was hoping the trump was just trying to
[1:33:24.140 --> 1:33:29.740]  Say, oh warp speed to reopen the economy, which he was and then later would criticize the vaccines, which he hasn't done
[1:33:30.140 --> 1:33:32.860]  Uh, so I was trying to play devil's abbey to figure out what the hell he was doing
[1:33:33.100 --> 1:33:36.380]  I have said for over a year that I'm very upset with what prompt's done
[1:33:36.940 --> 1:33:42.460]  Uh, pushing that all probably almost every show. So but I hear you and I appreciate your call. Okay
[1:33:43.100 --> 1:33:45.500]  Uh, we got a lot of other callers here when it goes to them in the
[1:33:46.140 --> 1:33:48.140]  Order that they are received
[1:33:48.140 --> 1:33:53.660]  Uh, let's go ahead and talk to matt in florida matt. Thanks for calling
[1:33:54.780 --> 1:33:57.820]  Alice is great to talk to you man. I'm gonna get right to it, dude
[1:33:57.900 --> 1:33:58.940]  I know you're a humble guy
[1:33:58.940 --> 1:34:03.420]  You don't like when people call in and tell you thank you and that you're doing a great job and everything
[1:34:03.820 --> 1:34:07.260]  But I want to tell you thank you because I've got a son that's in the marine corps
[1:34:07.740 --> 1:34:13.260]  And he's being screwed with quite a bit about this vaccine thing most of the people where he's at have taken it
[1:34:13.260 --> 1:34:20.540]  He's refused to take it after I've shown him the videos that you've made after the pin pinning videos and all the interviews
[1:34:20.860 --> 1:34:24.220]  And all the research the boy called me this morning. He said
[1:34:24.940 --> 1:34:25.900]  dad
[1:34:25.900 --> 1:34:32.140]  I asked him I I tried to kind of go easy with it because I remember being a young kid about his age
[1:34:32.540 --> 1:34:36.620]  in the navy and uh, you know, you want to go out you want to have a good time
[1:34:37.020 --> 1:34:40.620]  You want to have a beer you want to do this you want to do that and they're all being told no
[1:34:40.620 --> 1:34:46.780]  The ones that are not bowing down to this and I asked him today. I said son of you taking the shot
[1:34:46.860 --> 1:34:52.780]  He said I'm not taking that shot no matter what I don't I don't care what happens. Well, brother. Don't thank me
[1:34:53.420 --> 1:34:59.740]  It's gonna be my children my son's 18 my daughter 17 13 and 4 our children go together into the future
[1:34:59.820 --> 1:35:05.980]  We're one family and what's beautiful is you raise the son that's strong and you took the time to spread the word
[1:35:05.980 --> 1:35:10.860]  So I admire you and I commend you because there's no doubt. This is reducing fertility
[1:35:11.660 --> 1:35:13.660]  There's no doubt it's attacking the brain in the heart
[1:35:13.980 --> 1:35:18.620]  And so it's the most important thing your son's ever done and shame on the military and the leadership
[1:35:18.940 --> 1:35:22.300]  Bullying our armed services to take an experimental shot
[1:35:22.620 --> 1:35:28.380]  And we should be up in arms protesting congress and really upset and letting those commanders know
[1:35:28.380 --> 1:35:32.060]  They're going to be held responsible for anybody that gets sick from these deadly injections
[1:35:32.060 --> 1:35:37.740]  I got articles right here about troops having heart attacks and being hospitalized and dying from these injections
[1:35:39.500 --> 1:35:44.780]  Well, I've been thinking about it quite a bit and I wonder I've wondered are they giving them saline?
[1:35:44.780 --> 1:35:46.780]  Are they giving them the real deal or whatever?
[1:35:46.860 --> 1:35:48.460]  But if you wanted to collapse
[1:35:48.460 --> 1:35:52.060]  America and you want to collapse a free world and you want the hell on this earth
[1:35:52.780 --> 1:35:56.940]  First thing it needs to go down to the united states military and if everybody's running around
[1:35:56.940 --> 1:36:03.020]  23 years old with Alzheimer's and uh neurological disorders and all the rest of it
[1:36:03.340 --> 1:36:07.580]  Well, there goes your military and they're good. It's a soft kill weapon. They already tested it
[1:36:07.900 --> 1:36:12.380]  But the anthrax shot in the Gulf War that killed over 40,000 u.s. troops congressional studies
[1:36:12.700 --> 1:36:14.700]  Beautifully said god bless you matt
[1:36:15.740 --> 1:36:19.900]  I'm almost ashamed. I went to those callers that disagreed and wasted time. We have all these other great callers
[1:36:20.620 --> 1:36:21.820]  You know
[1:36:21.820 --> 1:36:24.460]  The last caller had legitimate points. Okay
[1:36:24.460 --> 1:36:27.900]  Um, you know the caller that disagreed it. It's just
[1:36:29.340 --> 1:36:32.700]  Trump's getting really hardcore republicans elected and
[1:36:33.340 --> 1:36:37.020]  They don't want trump doing that. They're trying to indict him right now. So I just
[1:36:37.580 --> 1:36:39.580]  Trump's not perfect
[1:36:41.260 --> 1:36:45.500]  And so he's gone now, so let's talk about joe biden
[1:36:48.940 --> 1:36:52.380]  It's that simple. I know people that are personal friends of mine that got so mad at me
[1:36:52.380 --> 1:36:54.380]  Still supporting trump
[1:36:55.660 --> 1:37:00.300]  Because under there about to steal the election from him and they didn't want him there. Well, they got what they want now
[1:37:00.380 --> 1:37:03.500]  So let's just move on from the trump bashing. Okay
[1:37:04.860 --> 1:37:07.020]  Let's just you're welcome to calling and bash me one
[1:37:07.020 --> 1:37:11.020]  I'm saying we should move on from it and know that he meant well and did a lot of good things
[1:37:11.420 --> 1:37:13.420]  Had some problems on numbers are perfect
[1:37:14.540 --> 1:37:16.540]  but
[1:37:16.620 --> 1:37:18.620]  You got joe biden now
[1:37:18.620 --> 1:37:22.540]  And I don't seem to hear those callers that are mad at trump mad at joe biden. Hmm
[1:37:23.900 --> 1:37:25.900]  Okay, who's up next here
[1:37:27.500 --> 1:37:31.500]  That would be charlie infima region five welcome charlie
[1:37:32.780 --> 1:37:35.900]  Yes, sir. Yes, sir. How are you doing with you? I'm good brother. Go ahead
[1:37:36.860 --> 1:37:42.620]  All right. Well, first of all, I gotta agree with you know a little bit about the last caller was talking about, you know, with trump
[1:37:43.100 --> 1:37:46.460]  You know, he did a lot more good. I agree, you know, you're you're a hundred percent spot on
[1:37:46.460 --> 1:37:50.860]  You know a lot more good than he did bad, but he's still advocating for the vaccine, brother
[1:37:51.260 --> 1:37:53.660]  Like I when I see him like talking about it, you know
[1:37:54.300 --> 1:37:57.740]  Saying our great vaccine and this and that and I'm like, what do I like?
[1:37:57.820 --> 1:38:02.380]  I mean if this guy is really bad hardcore supposedly, you know, the guy that's going to save us
[1:38:03.180 --> 1:38:07.420]  I mean, he should not be doing it. You should be really going at their Anthony Fauci
[1:38:07.980 --> 1:38:12.060]  Bill Gates, you know, and just giving them the business just I know he's doing
[1:38:12.140 --> 1:38:15.180]  Charlie stay there. I'm gonna come back to you. I realize I went to you a little bit late
[1:38:15.180 --> 1:38:19.980]  We're gonna come back to Charlie on his side. I 100% agree with you that Trump's biggest failing
[1:38:20.620 --> 1:38:25.420]  Is the so-called vaccine the next thing is not stopping censorship that he's the biggest victim of now
[1:38:26.060 --> 1:38:30.220]  Uh, and I know the inside baseball of trump. He's 75. He's overwhelmed
[1:38:30.620 --> 1:38:34.940]  He's a smart guy in many ways, but but not in others and once he shines on to something
[1:38:34.940 --> 1:38:38.060]  He's pigheaded about it saying I'm the one that got the vaccine
[1:38:38.140 --> 1:38:40.860]  I'm the good guy and now that it's coming out that it's hurting people
[1:38:41.340 --> 1:38:44.540]  He's too pigheaded to come out and say it. He is talking about actually bad
[1:38:44.540 --> 1:38:50.300]  It now and saying they may have stayed January 6th. That's more like it. Get on the offense, Trump. We'll be right back
[1:38:54.060 --> 1:38:58.380]  In 60 seconds, I have a really bad tendency about going into too much detail
[1:38:58.940 --> 1:39:03.100]  The listeners and viewers know that I straight shoot you. The last thing I would do is BS you
[1:39:03.660 --> 1:39:05.020]  I personal

[1:39:56.220 --> 1:40:00.940]  The globalists are having their revolution but free humanity has to have its revolution
[1:40:01.660 --> 1:40:04.140]  We have to first recognize this anti-human
[1:40:05.100 --> 1:40:07.100]  takeovers trying to
[1:40:07.820 --> 1:40:10.860]  enslave the entire biological processes of humans
[1:40:10.860 --> 1:40:14.060]  and turn us into these artificial corporate
[1:40:15.100 --> 1:40:17.100]  controlled
[1:40:17.500 --> 1:40:19.100]  slaves
[1:40:19.100 --> 1:40:22.780]  Orson slaves and just just property from cradle to grave of the system
[1:40:23.820 --> 1:40:25.820]  rendered down to be servile
[1:40:26.540 --> 1:40:28.540]  minions of the system and a ritual of
[1:40:29.340 --> 1:40:31.340]  dominance and satanic control
[1:40:31.340 --> 1:40:34.540]  We have to recognize the great reset post-industrial world
[1:40:34.540 --> 1:40:40.620]  Which realizes a nightmare dystopia and we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia
[1:40:41.340 --> 1:40:44.460]  It's that choice. It's that realization that's going to change the world
[1:40:45.500 --> 1:40:49.100]  And it's the only choice we've got freedom or slavery go to evil
[1:40:49.980 --> 1:40:53.100]  It is a spiritual battle and info wars at the tip of the spear fighting it
[1:40:55.580 --> 1:41:02.060]  Humanity has been domesticated by and large the population has been trained to submit do what you're told
[1:41:02.060 --> 1:41:04.460]  And it's all going to pass but if you study
[1:41:05.180 --> 1:41:09.580]  Authoritarians if you study the globalists you understand that they reach a point where all the training is just beta
[1:41:09.980 --> 1:41:15.500]  And you go into the point of being called being totally enslaved and because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid
[1:41:15.820 --> 1:41:22.220]  They are now making that move and they are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with the third world
[1:41:22.380 --> 1:41:27.980]  That the un will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis under such a load
[1:41:27.980 --> 1:41:34.860]  Capitulate to the un whatever agreements they want us to sign hoping that they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees
[1:41:35.500 --> 1:41:43.100]  Not fleeing coveted or climate change as the un and claus wabber saying and bill gates is saying but fleeing the year-long
[1:41:43.500 --> 1:41:48.940]  Lockdowns that the un and bill gates ordered them to institute or they wouldn't get more
[1:41:49.340 --> 1:41:54.700]  IMF and world bank money and that's why we have to really get educated about the globalist

[1:46:36.700 --> 1:46:41.900]  But are really popular that helps spread the word and it keeps us on air. That's how we get it done
[1:46:41.900 --> 1:46:46.620]  I want to go to this greg reese report. It's so important, but charlie infeema region six
[1:46:47.100 --> 1:46:51.820]  Please get your original point of vaccines and spiritual warfare. Tell me what you're thinking
[1:46:52.780 --> 1:46:57.980]  All right. Well, first, you know, we're talking about the vaccines. So basically like
[1:46:58.620 --> 1:47:00.140]  It's definitely the mark of the beast
[1:47:00.140 --> 1:47:03.660]  I think that's me is the mark of the beast or at least the microchip
[1:47:03.900 --> 1:47:09.100]  You know that claus schwavel was always talking about it's a genetic takeover of our body that god made reprogramming
[1:47:09.100 --> 1:47:11.100]  Is it definitely is a satanic takeover?
[1:47:11.100 --> 1:47:15.020]  It is hundred percent and i tell my family and all my family are you know
[1:47:15.420 --> 1:47:19.420]  Was talking about all jesus is but you know, they're all you know, very nice good people
[1:47:19.740 --> 1:47:23.500]  But then they're all taking the vaccines and i'm telling them like this is the mark of the beast
[1:47:23.580 --> 1:47:28.540]  They're just getting you ready right now so they can take over, you know, you're your whole genetic. Oh, you're
[1:47:29.100 --> 1:47:34.780]  You're everything they're just going to take everything from you. It's just you know, it's not even just and it's that's the president
[1:47:35.100 --> 1:47:37.100]  They came out in in stanford and said oh
[1:47:37.100 --> 1:47:41.900]  We've got a new injection. They call it a vaccine that fixes your body. Well, you're never die
[1:47:42.300 --> 1:47:49.260]  You're not going to get cancer or Alzheimer's anymore all lies and it takes over all your genetics in in gene rewriting
[1:47:49.260 --> 1:47:52.620]  So absolutely. This is a genetic really alien takeover
[1:47:53.580 --> 1:47:57.180]  Oh, yeah 100 and then with this new variant that they have coming out
[1:47:57.500 --> 1:48:02.540]  I'm pretty sure they're going to have what booster shots coming out what next year maybe even later on this year
[1:48:02.540 --> 1:48:04.460]  I'm like, oh, we got new booster shots for this
[1:48:04.460 --> 1:48:09.980]  You know variant, you know here take it and then obviously people are going to be foolish enough to be taking it
[1:48:10.140 --> 1:48:14.300]  And what's that going to happen? I mean like like how well it's already killing people in mass
[1:48:14.380 --> 1:48:16.220]  And they're testing to see if they can get away with it
[1:48:16.300 --> 1:48:18.860]  Then they're going to up the kill level with the booster shots. I agree
[1:48:19.020 --> 1:48:24.140]  Mike Adams is coming up more calls next segment and we're going to get to mark first when we come back in colorado
[1:48:24.140 --> 1:48:34.780]  But first here's the new report the 10 stages of genocide by greg reese share it now at info wars.com
[1:48:37.260 --> 1:48:42.940]  The word genocide was coined in 1944 by rafael lemkin
[1:48:43.580 --> 1:48:49.260]  It is the first word in the english language to denote something that's been around for all of history
[1:48:49.260 --> 1:48:55.900]  In france it was known as populous hide and in germany as folk murdering
[1:48:56.780 --> 1:49:02.220]  Genocide is the age-old action of wiping out large groups of the local population
[1:49:02.860 --> 1:49:06.620]  Whether it be for economic reasons or non-compliance
[1:49:07.180 --> 1:49:10.460]  Genocide is always motivated by political power
[1:49:11.260 --> 1:49:15.580]  The 10 stages of genocide is a model of the genocidal process
[1:49:15.580 --> 1:49:22.620]  We can use this model to clearly demonstrate the level of genocide many of us are facing today
[1:49:23.420 --> 1:49:25.420]  Stage one classification
[1:49:25.980 --> 1:49:30.380]  All cultures have categories to distinguish people into us and them
[1:49:31.020 --> 1:49:35.500]  Whether it be ethnicity race religion or nationality
[1:49:36.220 --> 1:49:38.220]  Classification is seen everywhere
[1:49:38.220 --> 1:49:45.420]  It seems to be an innate mechanism of the mind and america has a great way of keeping this mechanism in check
[1:49:46.140 --> 1:49:48.140]  E pluribus unum
[1:49:48.220 --> 1:49:55.660]  Which is why america is such an obvious target of the emerging globalist society and why we have been divided into two
[1:49:56.220 --> 1:49:57.820]  succinct groups
[1:49:57.820 --> 1:50:02.140]  patriots loyal to defending the u.s. Constitution and everyone else
[1:50:02.140 --> 1:50:08.140]  Stage two symbolization words such as republican
[1:50:08.700 --> 1:50:10.700]  Libertarian and oath keepers
[1:50:11.420 --> 1:50:16.860]  Have now been redefined to mean racist domestic terrorists and extremists
[1:50:17.500 --> 1:50:21.740]  Symbolization makes the work of dividing the people much more efficient
[1:50:22.460 --> 1:50:29.260]  And once divided allows the compliant group to participate in the genocide against the patriots
[1:50:29.260 --> 1:50:32.140]  Stage three discrimination
[1:50:32.780 --> 1:50:39.020]  The dominant group uses law custom and political power to deny the rights of the targeted group
[1:50:39.820 --> 1:50:41.820]  private multinational corporations
[1:50:42.540 --> 1:50:50.940]  Have monopolized all social discourse on the internet and have been blatantly discriminating against patriot voices for years
[1:50:51.740 --> 1:50:56.540]  We are also beginning to see signs of the coming discrimination against the so-called
[1:50:56.540 --> 1:51:02.540]  Unvaccinated who will soon be turned away for not having the official symbol on their mobile device
[1:51:03.020 --> 1:51:05.580]  Proving they are a member of the accepted group
[1:51:06.860 --> 1:51:08.700]  Stage four
[1:51:08.700 --> 1:51:15.180]  Dehumanization the compliant group is conditioned to deny the humanity of the group being marked for extermination
[1:51:15.580 --> 1:51:21.660]  They are made to believe that patriotic americans are ignorant evil and inherently racist
[1:51:21.660 --> 1:51:28.940]  And that they would all be better off without them dehumanization overcomes the normal human aversion to murder
[1:51:30.060 --> 1:51:32.060]  Stage five organization
[1:51:32.700 --> 1:51:34.700]  Genocide is always organized
[1:51:35.260 --> 1:51:41.820]  Usually by the state and the emerging globalist society. We are seeing today is highly organized
[1:51:42.220 --> 1:51:46.380]  They control all of pop culture the media and big pharma
[1:51:46.380 --> 1:51:51.100]  They are most likely the most organized tyranny in all of human history
[1:51:52.540 --> 1:51:54.380]  Stage six
[1:51:54.380 --> 1:52:01.020]  Polarization with the previous five stages in effect the people are now ripe for complete polarization
[1:52:01.740 --> 1:52:07.980]  Moderates are intimidated into silence and it becomes accepted that the targeted group must go
[1:52:08.460 --> 1:52:13.500]  The dominant group passes emergency laws granting them power over the targeted group
[1:52:13.500 --> 1:52:18.140]  Such as the national strategy for countering domestic terrorism
[1:52:18.620 --> 1:52:24.620]  Now that the people have been conditioned to accept that patriotic americans are now domestic terrorists
[1:52:25.100 --> 1:52:27.100]  The stage is set for genocide
[1:52:28.220 --> 1:52:30.540]  This is where we definitely are today
[1:52:31.420 --> 1:52:33.420]  Stage seven is preparation
[1:52:33.580 --> 1:52:38.620]  When plans are made for the relocation arrest or extermination of the targeted group
[1:52:39.020 --> 1:52:41.020]  Which is most likely already happening
[1:52:41.020 --> 1:52:48.060]  Stage eight is persecution when the targeted group begins getting arrested and separated from society
[1:52:48.700 --> 1:52:57.020]  There are already hundreds of innocent patriotic americans imprisoned indefinitely for protesting the stolen election of 2020
[1:52:58.140 --> 1:53:00.140]  Stage nine is extermination
[1:53:00.380 --> 1:53:02.380]  When the mass killing begins
[1:53:02.620 --> 1:53:04.620]  And stage 10 is denial
[1:53:04.860 --> 1:53:07.900]  Denial is the glue that makes all of this possible
[1:53:07.900 --> 1:53:12.300]  It is what has gotten us this far along this dark path so far
[1:53:12.700 --> 1:53:15.980]  And it is the only thing that will carry it through to the end
[1:53:16.860 --> 1:53:22.940]  There is no government or united nations coming to save american patriots from this genocide
[1:53:23.500 --> 1:53:28.940]  It will be up to the people alone to defeat this emerging global dystopia
[1:53:29.820 --> 1:53:32.320]  For info wars.com. This is greg reese
[1:53:32.320 --> 1:53:39.680]  Your life depends on getting this video out. It just went live at man dot video with free world news dot tv
[1:53:40.160 --> 1:53:42.160]  It's now up to you
[1:53:45.840 --> 1:53:50.000]  There's a lot of things that we can't do to stop the globalist, but there's a lot of things we can do
[1:53:50.560 --> 1:53:54.560]  And one of them is taking care of our bodies and our health and listen. I'm lecturing myself at the same time
[1:53:54.960 --> 1:53:57.040]  I put myself through too much stress. I don't eat right
[1:53:57.040 --> 1:54:01.440]  But one thing I do remember to do is to take my deep earth crystal high quality
[1:54:01.440 --> 1:54:04.720]  iodine and that of course is the original x2
[1:54:05.360 --> 1:54:08.080]  Incredible it is essential in your body
[1:54:08.480 --> 1:54:13.840]  It is a building block of everything that goes on the globalists work around the clock to make sure we are deficient in iodine
[1:54:14.000 --> 1:54:18.480]  And have way too much of all the garbage halogens like chlorine fluoride bromine and others
[1:54:18.720 --> 1:54:24.320]  We also have x3 and that's because some research scientists pointed out to me and I saw the research was true
[1:54:24.640 --> 1:54:27.040]  That some people can't absorb pure atomic iodine
[1:54:27.040 --> 1:54:33.360]  So it's pure atomic iodine and the two other types are also good for your body that some people get better benefits from
[1:54:33.360 --> 1:54:38.400]  So it's apples and oranges both products are pre-shipping double patriot points 50 percent off for
[1:54:39.120 --> 1:54:43.440]  survival shield x2 and 60 percent off for x3 even though it's selling out right now
[1:54:45.280 --> 1:54:50.960]  Gerald and South Carolina go ahead. You're on the air trying to move quicker. Hey, Alex. Welcome would like to say first off
[1:54:51.040 --> 1:54:55.760]  Thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity wanted to warn people
[1:54:55.760 --> 1:55:01.600]  I've been trying to get a hold of you for a year. Okay. I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria
[1:55:02.000 --> 1:55:04.000]  Infection on my lung that'll never go away
[1:55:04.560 --> 1:55:11.920]  Living defense saved my life. They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me living defense brought me back
[1:55:12.080 --> 1:55:17.520]  I wanted to just quote from the bible. Jesus is saying as to where we are right now
[1:55:17.680 --> 1:55:22.560]  This is Matthew 24 verse 9 then they shall deliver you up to be
[1:55:22.560 --> 1:55:29.120]  Afflicted and shall kill you and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake
[1:55:29.280 --> 1:55:34.720]  And then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another
[1:55:34.960 --> 1:55:36.480]  That's right where we're at brother
[1:55:36.480 --> 1:55:42.560]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say and that's why the enemy hates it because
[1:55:42.720 --> 1:55:44.720]  God created this country
[1:55:44.720 --> 1:55:51.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:56:01.920 --> 1:56:03.920]  I guess you didn't know
[1:56:05.760 --> 1:56:07.760]  I guess you didn't know
[1:56:09.600 --> 1:56:12.400]  I guess you did I guess you did I guess you didn't know
[1:56:12.400 --> 1:56:14.400]  I guess I didn't know
[1:56:20.400 --> 1:56:22.400]  Mike Adams is
[1:56:22.800 --> 1:56:24.800]  Ready for war
[1:56:25.360 --> 1:56:27.760]  The info war he's coming up next segment to cover
[1:56:28.720 --> 1:56:35.520]  Each new chapter in the coveted depopulation plan becomes more insane. We are living in a nightmare. They're trying to just normalize it
[1:56:35.600 --> 1:56:37.200]  We've got a fight
[1:56:37.200 --> 1:56:39.200]  Like hell to not let them normalize it
[1:56:39.200 --> 1:56:43.520]  We're taking phone calls right now marking colorado things for holding. You're on the air. Go ahead
[1:56:44.640 --> 1:56:45.920]  Yeah, Alex
[1:56:45.920 --> 1:56:47.920]  Good to hear from you. I uh
[1:56:48.480 --> 1:56:51.280]  Good to hear it. So boys are you here brother? What's on your mind?
[1:56:52.720 --> 1:56:56.960]  Yeah, the january 6th thing. Yeah, that was wow talk about a setup
[1:56:57.680 --> 1:57:01.360]  um, I just uh wanted to get my word out there and um
[1:57:02.080 --> 1:57:04.080]  say, you know, I almost went to that and uh
[1:57:05.200 --> 1:57:08.560]  What they're doing right now is just crazy that you know with the commission
[1:57:08.560 --> 1:57:13.120]  to investigate it and everything I can't believe that even yeah, they're spending the precedent
[1:57:13.520 --> 1:57:20.320]  To try to scare people from protesting and then demonizing a million people because 500 or 600 went into a capital most of them peaceful
[1:57:20.800 --> 1:57:22.800]  Uh, it's it's just it's just outrageous
[1:57:23.520 --> 1:57:29.200]  Yes, and here in colorado, you know, nice and colorado spring. We're pretty pretty conservative and
[1:57:30.080 --> 1:57:33.120]  I'll know we all know that election was stolen. It's just
[1:57:33.760 --> 1:57:35.920]  a matter of them wanting to listen to it
[1:57:35.920 --> 1:57:43.360]  But uh, anyhow, um, yeah, the ashley babbitt thing I watched that whole thing live. It was ridiculous
[1:57:43.680 --> 1:57:45.680]  Uh, I can't believe that
[1:57:46.080 --> 1:57:50.960]  You didn't even have a weapon. Um, and and I love how trump's exposing it and
[1:57:51.920 --> 1:57:54.720]  um, you're trying to um, anyway
[1:57:56.160 --> 1:57:59.360]  Um, but I have to rebuttal that last caller, you know the the
[1:58:00.080 --> 1:58:02.480]  the trump guy that didn't like trump because
[1:58:02.480 --> 1:58:06.560]  Of everything that's been going on, but he tries his best, you know
[1:58:06.560 --> 1:58:09.440]  I don't think in his heart that he knew that that vaccine
[1:58:09.760 --> 1:58:14.880]  Well, I mean, I just see now that trump got the elections stolen from him is gone people are even mad at him
[1:58:15.200 --> 1:58:18.880]  We just can't blame trump. We got to blame ourselves and just move forward. Thank you for the call mark
[1:58:19.040 --> 1:58:25.360]  Really appreciate you matthew's in florida. He wants to respond to the jewish conspiracy caller earlier. Go ahead
[1:58:25.360 --> 1:58:31.760]  Alex first, uh, appreciate you having me on but um to preface what i'm gonna say, um, and i'm sorry
[1:58:31.760 --> 1:58:35.040]  I can't give you nine minutes for i camels rubricus the gun. You got two minutes. Go go
[1:58:35.840 --> 1:58:41.680]  So, uh, what I wanted to say is I went to jewish state state school k through 12
[1:58:42.160 --> 1:58:46.720]  Grandchildren of holocaust survivors. My dad was born in dp camp is now a doctor
[1:58:47.280 --> 1:58:52.800]  Um, and all these theories the the boss child all that stuff that was part of the propaganda that that
[1:58:52.800 --> 1:58:55.360]  Resulted in my grandparents even being in the concentration camp
[1:58:56.160 --> 1:59:02.560]  um growing up though and seeing that and being in shuls where the rabbis seem to
[1:59:03.200 --> 1:59:10.000]  Not, uh, uh, take the side of israel the way my hebrou teachers were taking the side of israel when buses buses would blow up in
[1:59:10.000 --> 1:59:11.520]  Jerusalem and tel Aviv
[1:59:11.520 --> 1:59:15.520]  That made me realize maybe there's something going on here, but at the end of the day
[1:59:16.320 --> 1:59:21.440]  Um, the the fact that the jews have been so persecuted over time
[1:59:21.440 --> 1:59:27.840]  And the fact that in these holidays all of them involve persecution whether it's people forcibly
[1:59:28.160 --> 1:59:34.960]  Coming into private homes and forcing them to eat pork created a religion, right all these things. There's all persecution
[1:59:34.960 --> 1:59:36.400]  so unless
[1:59:36.400 --> 1:59:39.440]  religion was the original sigh up and
[1:59:40.400 --> 1:59:43.040]  and, uh, we've been fooled this whole time
[1:59:43.440 --> 1:59:48.000]  Then there's only really one way to look at it and the fact that, um
[1:59:48.000 --> 1:59:52.720]  You have people like Milton Friedman wasn't that proved something wrong that you think, uh, well, I mean, yeah
[1:59:52.720 --> 1:59:57.280]  I mean obviously there's the jews of diverse backgrounds and ideas and that's why I try to just
[1:59:57.920 --> 2:00:00.640]  All this stuff becomes a tail-chasing deal
[2:00:00.640 --> 2:00:06.960]  But then you have the adl coming out to get rid of free speech and then labeling anybody that's for america a bad
[2:00:07.280 --> 2:00:11.920]  That that is going to cause major pressure to be put on jews that are not part of
[2:00:12.640 --> 2:00:13.920]  Of that large situation
[2:00:13.920 --> 2:00:19.280]  Of of of that large situation. So leftist jews going out and persecuting people now
[2:00:19.760 --> 2:00:25.440]  Is going to cause a backlash and I think it's up to jews and anybody else to stand up and criticize what the adl's doing
[2:00:26.160 --> 2:00:29.920]  Alex one other thing when my dad first came to this country when they first came here
[2:00:29.920 --> 2:00:37.760]  And he was a baby and it was growing up the only anti-semitism and discrimination that he experienced in northern new jersey
[2:00:38.160 --> 2:00:42.560]  Was from the liberal jews who said you guys are disease
[2:00:42.560 --> 2:00:47.440]  You guys are giving us a bad name. You should go back. Why'd you come here? You're making us look bad
[2:00:48.000 --> 2:00:50.480]  That's what I've seen. I've definitely seen that. Thank you, sir

[2:02:02.320 --> 2:02:12.560]  From the front lines
[2:02:19.120 --> 2:02:24.160]  From the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[2:02:24.160 --> 2:02:32.560]  A new world order
[2:02:37.200 --> 2:02:39.200]  All right, we were born for this time
[2:02:39.760 --> 2:02:43.840]  And there's no doubt now that the so-called vaccine is deadly
[2:02:44.560 --> 2:02:47.760]  And that it is causing infertility heart attacks all sorts of problems
[2:02:48.240 --> 2:02:51.200]  All the vaccines were designed according to what faucian mill gates wanted
[2:02:51.200 --> 2:02:55.600]  The wheels have completely come off the world economy is collapsing the third world's imploding
[2:02:55.840 --> 2:03:04.640]  10 million illegals are coming across the uh, just the texas border of the border patrol estimates 5 million already have other 5 million by october into fiscal year
[2:03:05.840 --> 2:03:12.960]  This is the collapse of the country more than 40 percent of san francisco is planning to leave this year saying the city is deteriorating and has collapsed
[2:03:13.200 --> 2:03:18.080]  This is a world government plan to collapse and end the social contract
[2:03:18.080 --> 2:03:21.440]  Mike adams has been doing a great job over at naturalnews.com
[2:03:21.440 --> 2:03:37.440]  Chronicling the insane amount of mainline prestigious studies that in their attempts to whitewash what's happening document it the new england journal of medicine that's very prestigious
[2:03:37.440 --> 2:03:48.320]  saying that 82% of individuals that are pregnant to take the inoculation the baby dies
[2:03:48.880 --> 2:03:57.920]  We've got that we've got a british rocker dying from brain hemorrhage. I mean, we just this stuff is every day study links chest pain heart attacks in the troops
[2:03:57.920 --> 2:04:07.920]  and advisements in there saying that it can cause a heart attack nor way to pay compensation for astrocynical side effects
[2:04:07.920 --> 2:04:15.920]  and now they're sending the delta variant teams in to demand their way into your house which is the next phase of all this and they're talking about
[2:04:15.920 --> 2:04:21.920]  worldwide mass mandates and more lockdowns which haven't even ended in places like england and australia or canada
[2:04:21.920 --> 2:04:31.920]  and officials saying we're doing this to silence everyone for our political takeover so there's no longer any doubt you hit the moment of emergence
[2:04:31.920 --> 2:04:41.920]  when a tyranny isn't hiding anymore its tanks are rolling against you and so mike adams is here to talk about the spontaneous abortions
[2:04:41.920 --> 2:04:49.920]  he's here to talk about the studies he's here to talk about why are they giving saline everywhere well that's for certain groups and not others it's in the news now confirmed
[2:04:49.920 --> 2:04:56.920]  six months ago you go into the wall greens wherever they go oh you're black oh let me see oh you get this shot oh you're of course the wall greens
[2:04:56.920 --> 2:05:05.920]  or CVS or walmart employees aren't in on it they're just following some directive but who's running those directives we were talking about saline shots six months ago
[2:05:05.920 --> 2:05:13.920]  now it's hundreds of articles where they confirm they're doing it mike adams is really good at connecting the dots and deciphering things
[2:05:13.920 --> 2:05:22.920]  mike adams of naturalnews.com thank you so much for spending time with us on this Friday well thank you alex it's great to join you and exactly as you mentioned
[2:05:22.920 --> 2:05:32.920]  the new england journal of medicine published a science paper with a data set that shows that four out of five pregnancies where the women are given these
[2:05:32.920 --> 2:05:46.920]  injections during the first or second trimesters end in spontaneous abortions in less than 20 weeks that's 82% is what the data show and yet at the same time the study authors
[2:05:46.920 --> 2:05:56.920]  apparently attempted to obfuscate that fact and they included in their denominator of their calculation of the percentage they included 700 other women who weren't
[2:05:56.920 --> 2:06:06.920]  vaccinated until their third trimester and then said well gosh these 700 women vaccinated in the third trimester didn't have spontaneous abortions in the first 20 weeks
[2:06:06.920 --> 2:06:16.920]  which they couldn't have alex because pregnant women aren't time travelers they can't go back in time and have a spontaneous abortion in the first 20 weeks when they're
[2:06:16.920 --> 2:06:27.920]  injected in the last eight weeks so they use this obfuscation in order to try to conclude that the vaccines really aren't causing any kind of spontaneous abortions when their
[2:06:27.920 --> 2:06:42.920]  own data show that it's actually killing 82% of unborn human babies in the first 20 weeks so alex this is a this is a confirmation that the depopulation component is functioning exactly as engineered
[2:06:42.920 --> 2:06:54.920]  that they are going to see millions of reductions of live births probably just in the next 12 months who knows over the next few years this is like that Clive Owens sci-fi movie
[2:06:54.920 --> 2:07:03.920]  what was it called children children of men I think yes we're sterilized right we're entering that sci-fi future right now it's all confirmed
[2:07:03.920 --> 2:07:13.920]  what about the hundreds of articles I have here AP Reuters all of them admitting that oh it's an accident thousands here hundreds here are being given
[2:07:13.920 --> 2:07:23.920]  saline it's on the bottle they know the difference and they're reportedly looking at laptops looking at iPads to decide who gets what according to race that's in the news now
[2:07:23.920 --> 2:07:26.920]  there are now hundreds of witnesses that are reporting this
[2:07:26.920 --> 2:07:37.920]  well I think Sherry Tenpenny gave you an excellent answer on this I think she was on your show yesterday or the day before and she's exactly right that they don't want to make it obvious that
[2:07:37.920 --> 2:07:45.920]  they're killing everybody all at once and so they do they they inject some people with saline so they can claim oh look it's safe those people are fine
[2:07:45.920 --> 2:07:55.920]  but others get the spike protein injection which is a biological weapon but my my understanding and my guess here is that as the booster shots roll out
[2:07:55.920 --> 2:07:59.920]  the booster shots will become more and more aggressive in terms of their fatality
[2:07:59.920 --> 2:08:10.920]  and anybody who is unwise enough to sign up for more booster shots is eventually going to be killed by this biological weapon so remember they have to keep the delta variant mass hysteria
[2:08:10.920 --> 2:08:17.920]  in the media and now as you said they have these response teams which let's just face it we got to call them delta force
[2:08:17.920 --> 2:08:28.920]  they're like delta force government teams now except they're not defending our country they're killing humanity and they're going to roll out and spread mass hysteria to make sure more people sign up for the booster shots
[2:08:28.920 --> 2:08:39.920]  and that's where the real death wave kicks in so we may only be months away from the real sharp explosion of mass death across America from these vaccines Alex
[2:08:39.920 --> 2:08:49.920]  we also have the VAERS report and the different studies say 10, 50, 100 times more than what is actually reported but the average is about 40 they say it's an accurate number
[2:08:49.920 --> 2:09:00.920]  so if you've got 5,000, 6,000 deaths from the COVID vaccines here in the US and it's 40 times 6,000 that is a gigantic number they're banning these shots all over the world
[2:09:00.920 --> 2:09:15.920]  and people that ask what is this I believe this is the beta test still incredibly strong to see if we'll put up with all this death all this disease all these heart attacks now forcing them to put a warning like it's a pack of cigarettes on these injections
[2:09:15.920 --> 2:09:20.920]  is this the big push or is this just the beta for something bigger like you said the booster shots
[2:09:20.920 --> 2:09:31.920]  well these are just the early days of the real extermination war against humanity because as you said VAERS is currently reporting over 6,000 deaths following COVID vaccinations
[2:09:31.920 --> 2:09:40.920]  the real number in my estimation is at least 100,000 Americans have been killed by vaccines so far it might be a couple hundred thousand we just don't know for sure
[2:09:40.920 --> 2:09:50.920]  and let's be clear in the rat studies 6 months they did at UT 2012 Fauci paid for killed most of the rats within 6 months well in the life cycle that's like 3 or 4 years in a human
[2:09:50.920 --> 2:09:54.920]  and so we're going to see a lot more in the future aren't we
[2:09:54.920 --> 2:10:04.920]  well absolutely and don't forget there's something big that everybody's forgetting about this right now under emergency use authorization they are not allowed to mandate these vaccines
[2:10:04.920 --> 2:10:15.920]  but once they get FDA approval that attempts to confirm the safety and efficacy from their twisted point of view then they can mandate these vaccines on to everyone
[2:10:15.920 --> 2:10:27.920]  because they're no longer experimental and that's estimated to happen in October and when that happens the entire military will be forcibly injected and that's how they wipe out the United States military as well as the population
[2:10:27.920 --> 2:10:34.920]  keep going here Mike tell us when we come back and try to shut up and give me the floor what else is on your radar what we can do
[2:10:34.920 --> 2:10:48.920]  okay well it is clear this is a global extermination against humanity it's in the early phases it's going to accelerate and they're going to combine multiple vectors of a grid down collapse and economic collapse
[2:10:48.920 --> 2:10:59.920]  a second wave of bio warfare agents launched probably by communist China and I believe based on my sources once America is sufficiently weakened from within with internal race wars
[2:10:59.920 --> 2:11:10.920]  and perhaps a civil war they can engineer that and maybe nationwide gun confiscation attempts following a false flag attack then the communists will literally invade the continental United States
[2:11:10.920 --> 2:11:23.920]  perhaps through UN troops or communist Chinese troops working with narco cartels across the southern border and I've got numerous sources confirming all of this including the pre staging of weapons in the United States
[2:11:23.920 --> 2:11:38.920]  so the American people are going to be fighting a multi front war against invaders against a rogue element of perhaps the military and bio weapons and a grid down scenario all at the same time this was all happening together by design
[2:11:38.920 --> 2:11:51.920]  by the way Mike I 100% agree with you will explain why on the other side I'm not trying to scare you folks you must mobilize now this is the takedown of the US this is the final minutes of the republic stay with us
[2:11:51.920 --> 2:12:10.920]  your voice counts when you share information be it over the internet or in person it changes the world the globalists know their agenda is unpopular they know you're angry and now to get around big tech it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got

[2:12:51.920 --> 2:13:16.920]  the globalists are having their revolution but free humanity has to have its revolution we have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers trying to enslave the entire biological processes of humans and turn us into these artificial corporate controlled slaves
[2:13:16.920 --> 2:13:28.920]  or slaves just property from cradle to grave of the system rendered down to be servile minions of the system and a ritual of dominance and satanic control
[2:13:28.920 --> 2:13:38.920]  we have to recognize the great reset post-industrial world which realizes a nightmare dystopia and we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia
[2:13:38.920 --> 2:13:51.920]  it's that choice it's that realization that's going to change the world and it's the only choice we've got freedom or slavery go to evil it is a spiritual battle an info wars at the tip of the spear fighting it
[2:13:51.920 --> 2:14:07.920]  the most important thing I've done in the last eight years for my health for my middle clarity for my focus has been deep earth crystal iodine doctor group hammered me and hammered me nine ten years ago and said Alex you've got to start taking deep earth crystal atomic iodine
[2:14:07.920 --> 2:14:22.920]  and that when I finally started taking it it changed my life even the UN's own health website admits over two million people have cognitive disabilities lower IQ because of lack of iodine well we have two varieties of high quality iodine
[2:14:22.920 --> 2:14:37.920]  it'll blow you away on sale right now x2 there's deep earth crystal iodine and x3 there's tri iodine deep earth crystal iodine and two other types of some people need all three types of reformation so it's apples and oranges two different formulas some of them like one better or the other
[2:14:37.920 --> 2:14:54.920]  the point is they're all discounted right now fifty percent off for x2 sixty percent off for x3 with free shipping double patriot points through the fourth of July running out of x3 so get your orders in now at infowarscore.com
[2:14:54.920 --> 2:15:08.920]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:15:08.920 --> 2:15:28.920]  goes down you will find me hanging around nightlife ain't no good life but it's my life
[2:15:28.920 --> 2:15:38.920]  you know I'd like to go back to the old days still an open free society but that's all ending
[2:15:38.920 --> 2:15:53.920]  ladies and gentlemen we're witnessing unrestricted undeclared warfare 21st century attack by major corporations to come in with big media and not tell you that they ordered the texas power shut off in the official documents said no you can't
[2:15:53.920 --> 2:16:09.920]  stop the rise to up your power for the storm that was on record or they shut down the keystone pipeline or the colonial those were all test and so Mike Adams joining us earlier back with us now said this is the beginning of the main assault
[2:16:09.920 --> 2:16:27.920]  they shut down the economy the shutdown of the power grid the collapse of all the major blue cities a race war is the cover to then bring in the foreign union troops under the strong cities initiative it's all official it's here and the Pentagon saying it's not China
[2:16:27.920 --> 2:16:43.920]  it's not any foreign countries a threat it's the American people people that don't want lockdowns people that don't want for synoculations people that question elections declaring us the enemy and spying on Tucker Carlson
[2:16:43.920 --> 2:16:59.920]  it happened we let them kill the babies we let them do all the GMO we let them do it all and so they're going for broke now and claus Schwab says we're going to censor the whole Internet we're going to take control everybody we're going to control things with corporate governance what you can stay and do we're going to suppress medical treatments
[2:16:59.920 --> 2:17:15.920]  because we're tired and here he is saying the power grid is going to go down which of course is John Hopkins announcement the next big move it's all been a beta test to totally bring us to our knees to consolidate control the virus was the beta testing it is used to
[2:17:15.920 --> 2:17:37.920]  being locked down now the real attacks coming I believe a national original power outage here he is still pay insufficient attention to the frightening scenario of a comprehensive cyber attack which would bring to a complete halt to the power supply
[2:17:37.920 --> 2:18:05.920]  transportation hospital services our society as a whole the COVID-19 crisis would be seen in this respect as a small disturbance in comparison to a major cyber attack to use the COVID-19 crisis as a timely opportunity to reflect on the lessons
[2:18:05.920 --> 2:18:23.920]  so he says he wants to know people he wants to cut carbon he said COVID helped us do less now he says oh a big power outage is coming oh it's going to be so terrible so he'll be the hero once it happens Mike Adams is all scripted it's all prepared it's all happening now what do we do
[2:18:23.920 --> 2:18:39.920]  see when when when he talks about this coming cyber grid attack you know he he's saying it licking his lips you know with a sense of joy with a sense of knowing that this is what's coming the same way Fauci warned that Trump was going to have to deal with a biological
[2:18:39.920 --> 2:18:54.920]  weapons attack they know it's coming because they're engineering it but I want to bring people's attention to a really important metaphor in all of this that condo collapse in Miami and of course my my prayers go out to all the innocent victims of that collapse
[2:18:54.920 --> 2:19:09.920]  but there was one woman who I believe lived on the seventh floor she ran out of the building because she heard a sound she got up there's like two or three in the morning when this happened she got up and she saw a giant crack appear in the
[2:19:09.920 --> 2:19:24.920]  wall a crack that she said was two fingers wide in terms of its gap and she heard sounds and her her balcony door would no longer shut because of the geometry of the doorway had shifted she immediately realized hey I've got to get out something's not right
[2:19:24.920 --> 2:19:40.920]  with this and she ran down seven flights and she got out she survived in the building collapse behind her now why is this important to understand because right now Alex your viewers my listeners those are the people who are seeing the signs of the
[2:19:40.920 --> 2:19:56.920]  collapse that is about to accelerate at the speed of gravity here I totally agree it's a metaphor like deep water horizon was or this of the collapse that's already begun the cracks are already there the door is already good yes
[2:19:56.920 --> 2:20:12.920]  and for those who are wise enough to to see what's happening and to then adjust adapt escape this problem or be prepared that they will be the survivors well most people did not survive because they never saw the signs where they were asleep and it
[2:20:12.920 --> 2:20:19.920]  happened during their sleep hours but for those who are willing to pay attention you can see what's about to happen and and all of your viewers can see it.
[2:20:19.920 --> 2:20:35.920]  They implode us and then invade us as quote saviors with international I for force described how the dominoes fall could be next week could be a six months from now but you can see this is the imminent modern attack we are under attack we America is falling
[2:20:35.920 --> 2:20:36.920]  right now.
[2:20:36.920 --> 2:20:45.920]  Well one thing that's clear to me is that they won't launch the land invasion of the continental United States until they believe they have confiscated some significant portion of the firearms.
[2:20:45.920 --> 2:20:49.920]  So.
[2:20:49.920 --> 2:20:57.920]  Exactly they're going to try to launch a race war they're going to pull off a false flag event try to blame of course the gun owners and Trump supporters and Christians and so on.
[2:20:57.920 --> 2:21:03.920]  They will see if the people will comply to turn in their guns which I believe people will not comply.
[2:21:03.920 --> 2:21:08.920]  That would be insane at this point with the police being defunded and violent crime exploding.
[2:21:08.920 --> 2:21:20.920]  You know all across liberal cities everywhere people need self defense more than ever including by the way women and people of color and also gays and lesbians and transgenders are buying guns.
[2:21:20.920 --> 2:21:33.920]  More than ever before right now so it's the left that's buying guns more than ever so it's going to make gun control very difficult among left wing legislators so they're going to try to push a false flag and they're going to try to take the guns.
[2:21:33.920 --> 2:21:44.920]  If we the American people if we surrender our guns I believe we will be invaded by communists physically with a bullet in it for every one of us.
[2:21:44.920 --> 2:21:48.920]  They will they will then exterminate every last living American.
[2:21:48.920 --> 2:21:55.920]  They need to take over America confirmed by the Canadian military now that that the Chinese troops are massing in Canada.
[2:21:55.920 --> 2:22:02.920]  Canada's under martial law saying we don't want people go outside they might talk and hundreds of thousands of Chinese troops bare minimum are massing.
[2:22:02.920 --> 2:22:14.920]  Well that's absolutely true they're massing on in the north in Canada but the larger movement will I believe come from the south because for many years and I've confirmed this with numerous sources.
[2:22:14.920 --> 2:22:29.920]  A communist Chinese military generals have been training a narco cartel troops and you know they have the armored vehicles they've got the routes to bring weapons in they pre stage weapons as I said before and they have incredible amount of funding in order to achieve this.
[2:22:29.920 --> 2:22:42.920]  They will launch war from the south if we give up our guns so I've got to say to the American people we must protect the second amendment because if you surrender you will be invaded and you will be slaughtered.
[2:22:42.920 --> 2:22:48.920]  This is not just about defending you know the the right for self defense against the tyrannical government.
[2:22:48.920 --> 2:22:51.920]  This is about defending the nation against foreign invaders.
[2:22:51.920 --> 2:23:02.920]  You're totally right in the climate of the takedown they're not going to just launch a bio attack through vaccines that kills tens of millions and then let us get mad and take the government back.
[2:23:02.920 --> 2:23:10.920]  You only do that as a preparatory phase to soften everyone up ahead of an even bigger attack the attacks are going to get exponential.
[2:23:10.920 --> 2:23:23.920]  Yeah exactly and then add in a grid down scenario where you lose the basic infrastructure of functioning American communities and add in a potential financial collapse and race wars and possible EMP weapons.
[2:23:23.920 --> 2:23:32.920]  I mean this is a total takedown it's coming we've got to plan to be able to survive and defend our nation off grid off grid.
[2:23:32.920 --> 2:23:36.920]  I think you agree it's going to be before the midterms they try to fully take the U.S. down.
[2:23:36.920 --> 2:23:41.920]  That's what it seems like yes although there may be there may be delays in their plan but that's their intention.
[2:23:41.920 --> 2:23:44.920]  All right stay there Mike Adams more on the deadly bio attack.
[2:23:44.920 --> 2:23:53.920]  Confirmed in the vaccine extermination of America happening right now.

[2:27:55.920 --> 2:27:58.920]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:28:29.920 --> 2:28:34.920]  Welcome back to Alex Jones show. I want to be 100% clear with our listeners of yours.
[2:28:34.920 --> 2:28:37.920]  I'm not saying all this to be sensational.
[2:28:37.920 --> 2:28:46.920]  They have given experimental vaccines that we know Fauci tested at the UT level 4 weapons lab that killed almost all the mice and rats they tested it on.
[2:28:46.920 --> 2:28:49.920]  They knew before they put this out it would cause heart attacks.
[2:28:49.920 --> 2:28:54.920]  It would cause bleeding in the brain and it's happened.
[2:28:54.920 --> 2:28:58.920]  And now they're trying to cover that up and the death rates off the charts.
[2:28:58.920 --> 2:29:04.920]  So when you hit your own country was something of that level.
[2:29:04.920 --> 2:29:11.920]  You're only doing it because you plan to do something even worse that will distract folks from that.
[2:29:11.920 --> 2:29:13.920]  Then the next attack will be even bigger.
[2:29:13.920 --> 2:29:20.920]  So we're asking what is the big attack you read about history you hear about times with millions dead wars and starving and death.
[2:29:20.920 --> 2:29:28.920]  That's when countries didn't agree with each other. We have a global corporate system playing countries off against each other bringing in a nightmare program.
[2:29:28.920 --> 2:29:30.920]  And so the sky's the limit.
[2:29:30.920 --> 2:29:47.920]  What do we do Mike Adams to telegraph to the deep state to the George Soros and the New World Order types that they're not going to get away with this because they have really set loose the fires of race war and division and collapse.
[2:29:47.920 --> 2:29:57.920]  They've already the lockdowns already caused the third world to collapse and massive migrant waves the U.N. is using as a political and economic and cultural and military weapon.
[2:29:57.920 --> 2:30:06.920]  I mean the big picture the world's on fire the world's disintegrating blue cities by designer imploding not just here but all the world they're doing this.
[2:30:06.920 --> 2:30:10.920]  How do you see them playing this out and how do we counter it.
[2:30:10.920 --> 2:30:21.920]  Well let me be clear and I know this is going to sound odd but long term I'm an optimist and how this plays out because well for the following reasons and plus we have God on our side.
[2:30:21.920 --> 2:30:28.920]  But in the short term I believe the globalist will succeed in mass murdering at least a billion human beings on our planet today.
[2:30:28.920 --> 2:30:29.920]  Maybe more.
[2:30:29.920 --> 2:30:43.920]  They will succeed in taking down the America that we once knew I believe the Republic will fall but it will be reborn by the survivors and the rebuilders who are the people the kind of people that that watch this very show.
[2:30:43.920 --> 2:30:53.920]  And the reason is because the globalists in order for them to succeed long term they have to achieve a near 99% extermination and they won't.
[2:30:53.920 --> 2:31:05.920]  They may exterminate 25% maybe even 50% what you're saying I've got to interrupt you're right when and the people say well they're losing and they're only getting a low percentage to inoculate why are they doing it.
[2:31:05.920 --> 2:31:12.920]  Once they triggered this they can't turn back this it's like a boulder going downhill they've already initiated the war is that what you're saying.
[2:31:12.920 --> 2:31:18.920]  Yes they've initiated the war but they've already failed in the long run because so many people are aware of it.
[2:31:18.920 --> 2:31:25.920]  They did not succeed in silencing every voice of truth they did not succeed although they tried desperately especially within for wars.
[2:31:25.920 --> 2:31:33.920]  But the other thing is that the answer for those of us who are going to rebuild a new society rooted in principles of liberty.
[2:31:33.920 --> 2:31:42.920]  The new America as I call it we all we've got to do is survive this engineered collapse which means we've got to be prepared.
[2:31:42.920 --> 2:31:49.920]  We've got to be ready for no power grid for six months or a year no food supplies for a year or longer and so on.
[2:31:49.920 --> 2:31:54.920]  We've got to be prepared and mentally prepared as well for what's coming.
[2:31:54.920 --> 2:32:01.920]  Once we make it through that and I'm not saying it's going to be easy a lot of lives will be lost families will be destroyed you know it's going to be hell.
[2:32:01.920 --> 2:32:11.920]  But if we get through that then we will succeed in rebuilding society and defeating the globalist agenda because at that point they will have nowhere left to hide.
[2:32:11.920 --> 2:32:19.920]  And by the way we're not just saying this all the globalists explained to them we told people this 10 years ago now it's in all the New York Times Washington Post.
[2:32:19.920 --> 2:32:25.920]  They've got armored redoubts they've run to New Zealand they run to Kauai they run to Tasmania they've run up to Northern Canada.
[2:32:25.920 --> 2:32:27.920]  They're all digging in and leaving and hiding.
[2:32:27.920 --> 2:32:34.920]  I mean they've done this they've triggered this we're not trying to be negative we're not trying to scare people they've initiated the damn collapse of the planet.
[2:32:34.920 --> 2:32:37.920]  And it's horrible it's just horrible.
[2:32:37.920 --> 2:32:43.920]  And you know realize that preparing is not just about self defense.
[2:32:43.920 --> 2:32:47.920]  It's not just about defending your life or your family or your community or even your nation.
[2:32:47.920 --> 2:32:54.920]  At this point preparedness is the most important pro human activity in which you can engage.
[2:32:54.920 --> 2:33:00.920]  And I'm really trying to emphasize with people in my own work about being ready for off grid situations.
[2:33:00.920 --> 2:33:12.920]  So this is not a commercial plug for any company I know but just have a solar you know power bank a solar generator is sometimes called have a way to gather solar energy store it.
[2:33:12.920 --> 2:33:21.920]  You can charge yourself for five years it's I better be off the grid I better have everything I better get ready and I'm not even myself ready because I'm so busy fighting up on the front lines.
[2:33:21.920 --> 2:33:24.920]  But I mean I know you can see this.
[2:33:24.920 --> 2:33:32.920]  Yeah no I know the feeling I have the same conundrum it's like how much should I spend how much time doing videos and helping others versus doing my own preparedness right.
[2:33:32.920 --> 2:33:48.920]  So we all we try to balance this but everybody's got to be ready to operate off grid which means off grid food off grid food preservation off grid being able to charge a small electronic devices such as a night vision device you know for security
[2:33:48.920 --> 2:34:03.920]  or radio what it's going to look like if they do a three month power grid off that'll create irrevocable problems 50 times worse the covid lockdown you'll have just masses of burning cities starving people look like a zombie apocalypse within two weeks.
[2:34:03.920 --> 2:34:10.920]  It will absolutely be a zombie apocalypse and there will be mass migrations out of the cities for those who can survive the trek.
[2:34:10.920 --> 2:34:18.920]  The cities like Los Angeles being that there's so much desert to the east of L.A. there won't be that many survivors who can walk out on foot from Los Angeles.
[2:34:18.920 --> 2:34:21.920]  L.A. will be turned into a massive death zone.
[2:34:21.920 --> 2:34:27.920]  It seems to have already begun with some of the videos I've seen with the the massive homeless camps that's trash everywhere.
[2:34:27.920 --> 2:34:33.920]  It's a city in collapse but that's going to happen in Chicago it's going to happen in Miami in Houston.
[2:34:33.920 --> 2:34:43.920]  Civilization with our top engineers was hard to continue once the globalists made us decadent and evil and started shutting it down it will collapse they've initiated it.
[2:34:43.920 --> 2:35:01.920]  Yeah we're going to have a combination I say of I am legend with Will Smith and idiocracy with Mike judge so we're going to have legendary idiocracy basically all across America just mass death mass collapse people who are unprepared clueless have no idea what to do.
[2:35:01.920 --> 2:35:11.920]  And then you're going to have this small contingent of survivors who are the veterans you know former law enforcement retired cops preppers people who watch this show.
[2:35:11.920 --> 2:35:17.920]  These are the people who are going to be the survivors we're going to have a mass die off in the United States is no question in my mind.
[2:35:17.920 --> 2:35:24.920]  And I mean tens of millions of people will die because of what's being engineered without a power grid every major city collapses.
[2:35:24.920 --> 2:35:32.920]  And you'll have a 70 to 80 percent fatality rate in in those cities even according to government reports on the after effects.
[2:35:32.920 --> 2:35:40.920]  So they're starting the euthanasia because by the time there's a full collapse no one will notice why everybody's dying because it'll just be no food anyways.
[2:35:40.920 --> 2:35:52.920]  Yes I think they also know that when the collapse comes will be very limited resources and they're trying to pre exterminate as many people as possible so that those people aren't taking the food supplies that a lot of these Democrat.
[2:35:52.920 --> 2:36:02.920]  Governors testing the tech is if you'll cover up treatments for viruses and if you'll cover up mothers that kids die you'll cover up anything during what's about to happen.
[2:36:02.920 --> 2:36:03.920]  There's all this a test.
[2:36:03.920 --> 2:36:11.920]  Yeah I know but what's fascinating is the relevance of media and even the Internet will be obsolete when the grid goes down.
[2:36:11.920 --> 2:36:18.920]  I mean think about it folks there will be no functioning Internet for this period of time not forever but as a grid is down there's no Internet.
[2:36:18.920 --> 2:36:25.920]  There's no media. There's not even cryptocurrency when the grid's down. See. So you've got to have backup plans. You've got to have.
[2:36:25.920 --> 2:36:32.920]  They're all going to have the money preposition guard their facilities during the collapse that wipes out all their competition.
[2:36:32.920 --> 2:36:35.920]  Then once they turn the power back on they'll be the last people standing.
[2:36:35.920 --> 2:36:40.920]  Well I think there's no doubt that all the retailers are going to be looted very very quickly.
[2:36:40.920 --> 2:36:44.920]  Some may have a defense as you mentioned and they may be able to hold out for some period of time.
[2:36:44.920 --> 2:36:54.920]  But once the starvation spectrum kicks in you know when people reach famine their behavior shifts quite dramatically and they drop any pretense of polite interaction in society.
[2:36:54.920 --> 2:36:56.920]  You must become psychotic murdering machines.
[2:36:56.920 --> 2:37:03.920]  Absolutely. You said it psychotic murdering machines and or zombies as we say and that's coming that's absolutely coming.
[2:37:03.920 --> 2:37:07.920]  The shortages are real the food shortages you've probably seen it in your commercial operations.
[2:37:07.920 --> 2:37:10.920]  I know I have the shortages are real supply lines are collapsing.
[2:37:10.920 --> 2:37:14.920]  I was talking to Norm Adams in Connecticut he said the store shelves are half bear.
[2:37:14.920 --> 2:37:16.920]  He said it's like I'm not surprised.
[2:37:16.920 --> 2:37:25.920]  Yeah it's going to get way worse and they are intentionally shutting down food production by using covid as an excuse in many cases.
[2:37:25.920 --> 2:37:28.920]  And also transportation lines are completely maxed out.
[2:37:28.920 --> 2:37:31.920]  They can't get enough truck drivers trains ships anything.
[2:37:31.920 --> 2:37:33.920]  So it's coming folks.
[2:37:33.920 --> 2:37:40.920]  Now into the whole supply chain. Meanwhile Gates is buying up all the farmland for on the other side of this.
[2:37:40.920 --> 2:37:41.920]  You're exactly right.
[2:37:41.920 --> 2:37:43.920]  Mike Adams most powerful interview ever with you.
[2:37:43.920 --> 2:37:45.920]  Let's come back and talk about more solutions.
[2:37:45.920 --> 2:37:47.920]  We've given folks the bad news.
[2:37:47.920 --> 2:37:51.920]  We'll talk about survival straight ahead.
[2:37:51.920 --> 2:37:57.920]  Hydrofluorolytic acid is an electrified form of fluoride.
[2:37:57.920 --> 2:38:03.920]  Now microscopic hydrofluorolytic acid are needed for our bodies and are good for us.
[2:38:03.920 --> 2:38:06.920]  But tiny amounts a lot of it's deadly poison.
[2:38:06.920 --> 2:38:08.920]  But hydrofluorolytic acid is electrified.
[2:38:08.920 --> 2:38:12.920]  It's one of the most deadly toxic poisons on the planet.
[2:38:12.920 --> 2:38:16.920]  And since the late 1940s a little gift from the New World Order.
[2:38:16.920 --> 2:38:19.920]  They've been putting it in our water to annihilate our DNA,
[2:38:19.920 --> 2:38:23.920]  twist our chromosomes and lower our infuse and fertility.
[2:38:23.920 --> 2:38:28.920]  Well there has to be a good halogen and it's called iodine.
[2:38:28.920 --> 2:38:33.920]  And we happen to have the highest quality formulas of iodine available anywhere.
[2:38:33.920 --> 2:38:40.920]  We have to have a DEA license and our manufacturer just to put out the deep earth crystals that are in X2 and X3.
[2:38:40.920 --> 2:38:42.920]  Both of which are discounted through the 4th of July.
[2:38:42.920 --> 2:38:46.920]  The double-patria points and free shipping 50% off for X2.
[2:38:46.920 --> 2:38:48.920]  60% off for X3 and X3 selling out.
[2:38:48.920 --> 2:38:50.920]  Take advantage of it now.
[2:38:50.920 --> 2:38:54.920]  The globalists are having their revolution.
[2:38:54.920 --> 2:38:57.920]  But free humanity has to have its revolution.
[2:38:57.920 --> 2:39:02.920]  We have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers.
[2:39:02.920 --> 2:39:07.920]  Trying to enslave the entire biological processes of humans.
[2:39:07.920 --> 2:39:14.920]  And turn us into these artificial corporate controlled slaves.
[2:39:14.920 --> 2:39:20.920]  Orson slaves, just property from cradle to grave of the system.
[2:39:20.920 --> 2:39:27.920]  Rendered down to be servile minions of the system and a ritual of dominance and safety and control.
[2:39:27.920 --> 2:39:33.920]  We have to recognize their great reset post-industrial world which realizes a nightmare dystopia
[2:39:33.920 --> 2:39:37.920]  and we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia.
[2:39:37.920 --> 2:39:41.920]  It's that choice. It's that realization that's going to change the world.
[2:39:41.920 --> 2:39:46.920]  And it's the only choice we've got. Freedom or slavery, go to evil.
[2:39:46.920 --> 2:39:51.920]  It is a spiritual battle and info wars at the tip of the spear fight again.
[2:39:51.920 --> 2:39:59.920]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone from beta testing to operational.
[2:39:59.920 --> 2:40:04.920]  The globalists are out in the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot takeover.
[2:40:04.920 --> 2:40:07.920]  But the good news is we've been working and you've been working.
[2:40:07.920 --> 2:40:12.920]  And others have been working across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to find it off.
[2:40:12.920 --> 2:40:18.920]  Humanity is strong. We're incredible. And if we're aware of the attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating it.
[2:40:18.920 --> 2:40:21.920]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[2:40:21.920 --> 2:40:27.920]  So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential and warning others is absolutely essential.
[2:40:27.920 --> 2:40:33.920]  And at the same time, supporting info wars by buying high quality products to keep us on air is essential

[2:41:54.920 --> 2:42:03.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:42:03.920 --> 2:42:27.920]  All right, Mike Adams, naturalnews.com is our guest. He's dead on. This is a real analysis. You see times in history where civilizations, societies commit suicide and it's being done again.
[2:42:27.920 --> 2:42:34.920]  It's a very dangerous move by the ruling class, but they really believe that the earth's overpopulated and they're saving people, you know, saving themselves.
[2:42:34.920 --> 2:42:39.920]  But at the end of the day, they're really psychotics.
[2:42:39.920 --> 2:42:47.920]  Mike, why would they try such a reckless move? Is it because their whole pedophile network was being exposed? Globalism was being challenged.
[2:42:47.920 --> 2:42:52.920]  We knew they had this on the shelf. They'd written about it. They talked about it and all those different documents like lockstep.
[2:42:52.920 --> 2:43:06.920]  But now they're doing it. I mean, this is just we now know for sure the super bold move to give somebody a vaccine doesn't protect you from covid and gives you blood clots all over your body and grows crystals in your brain.
[2:43:06.920 --> 2:43:16.920]  I mean, just and of course, because they want to hit us. Everybody's dying once the collapse hits and it'll just make it 100 times worse because your family will be dying around you.
[2:43:16.920 --> 2:43:22.920]  I mean, this is it. People need to know this is the genocide that Hitler wanted, but couldn't figure out how to do sophisticatedly.
[2:43:22.920 --> 2:43:26.920]  He did it with airplanes and tanks. People fought back. He lost. They've done it in the medical system.
[2:43:26.920 --> 2:43:30.920]  I don't think people realize that every day that we've got is precious.
[2:43:30.920 --> 2:43:35.920]  What's the time frame on this? And is there a way to hold this back? Is there a way to stop it?
[2:43:35.920 --> 2:43:44.920]  Well, you've hit upon something really important. So yes, the election of Trump, in fact, cause well and populism growing all around the world, even with Brexit, for example,
[2:43:44.920 --> 2:43:52.920]  caused the globalists to have to accelerate their plans. So like you said, they were originally shooting for a lot of this for 2030 or 2035.
[2:43:52.920 --> 2:44:10.920]  They moved it up because of the populist uprising and Trump's people were able to then gain control over, for example, certain segments of the NSA or the Defense Intelligence Agency that recently received the high level Chinese spy that defected with a lot of information.
[2:44:10.920 --> 2:44:20.920]  So the globalists panic, but this will be their undoing, Alex. They panicked and they unleashed all of these attacks before they had completed absolute censorship.
[2:44:20.920 --> 2:44:31.920]  So the fact that you and I are on the air right now, the fact that Tucker Carlson is on the air, this is going to be the downfall because they can't cover up the truth like they had planned.
[2:44:31.920 --> 2:44:42.920]  They needed about five more years to take everybody offline and then they could roll this out and there would be no dissenting views. But because, again, because of Trump's victory and the populist uprising, they had to accelerate that.
[2:44:42.920 --> 2:44:53.920]  So I 100% agree with that analysis. They even admit they accelerated their plan. We forced them to. So as bad as it is, they'll only be able to kill 20% of the world population instead of 90.
[2:44:53.920 --> 2:45:01.920]  And in the end, exactly, once now the people know it's an attack, they can't stop the attack. Once they launch it, it'll generate total rebellion and their annihilation in the end.
[2:45:01.920 --> 2:45:07.920]  The question is, are they crazy enough to start a nuclear war to try to get rid of this even faster?
[2:45:07.920 --> 2:45:14.920]  Well, perhaps I believe it's possible that they may use nuclear weapons to strike military targets in the United States.
[2:45:14.920 --> 2:45:24.920]  But let's remember that the globalists, ultimately, they want America's food producing farmland, especially for Communist China, that can't produce a sufficient food supply domestically.
[2:45:24.920 --> 2:45:28.920]  And that's why the Chinese agent Gates is buying it all up.
[2:45:28.920 --> 2:45:37.920]  Well, exactly right. And this is also why bioweapons that target specifically human tissue were one of the priority weapons because it doesn't destroy the farmland.
[2:45:37.920 --> 2:45:46.920]  In fact, the ACE2 receptor targets for the spike protein, which are in the vaccines, they don't even harm animals. It's only humans.
[2:45:46.920 --> 2:45:48.920]  It's targeted humans so they can kill off the American people.
[2:45:48.920 --> 2:45:51.920]  It's a biological neutron bomb.
[2:45:51.920 --> 2:45:54.920]  Yeah, exactly. That's a good way to say it. That's exactly what it is.
[2:45:54.920 --> 2:46:08.920]  Because, you see, they want America's rivers and farmlands and soils and ports, you know, roadways, bridges, highways. They want the infrastructure. If there's any infrastructure left after Biden ruins everything.
[2:46:08.920 --> 2:46:13.920]  But they want America's infrastructure. They don't want the American people. So they've had to accelerate all this.
[2:46:13.920 --> 2:46:21.920]  But I think what has been set into motion now is actually going to end up in the total destruction of the globalists.
[2:46:21.920 --> 2:46:31.920]  Now, America will suffer serious wounds. And the nation that we once knew will never come back. We're not going back to 2019 ever again.
[2:46:31.920 --> 2:46:37.920]  But America, it won't be erased from history. We will surge back.
[2:46:37.920 --> 2:46:41.920]  The fighting games are over. The fighting games are over.
[2:46:41.920 --> 2:46:50.920]  Well, absolutely. And people now realize, or soon they will, as the people around them keep dying from this vaccine, they will realize this is a life and death fight.
[2:46:50.920 --> 2:46:56.920]  This is a fight for survival to the very end that the globalists want a, quote, final solution against humanity.
[2:46:56.920 --> 2:47:03.920]  And in fact, you know, just going back to what we opened up this hour with, the vaccines that attack pregnant women, that's a vaccine holocaust.
[2:47:03.920 --> 2:47:15.920]  That's a holocaust scale attack on human babies. In fact, they're probably going to kill so many babies that Planned Parenthood will complain that they don't have enough babies left to slaughter because they're all killed by the vaccines.
[2:47:15.920 --> 2:47:21.920]  Well, they ought to admit birth rates are record low in the U.S. and worldwide just with the lockdown and record level miscarriages with the injections.
[2:47:21.920 --> 2:47:25.920]  Yeah. Folks, they've committed. We're in it now.
[2:47:25.920 --> 2:47:36.920]  Exactly. And they've already made tactical mistakes. They have overexposed themselves in ways that are going to come back on them, but they can't pull it back now.
[2:47:36.920 --> 2:47:42.920]  Why do you think they pulled the case out a month ago and removed him from a command position?
[2:47:42.920 --> 2:47:48.920]  Well, I don't know. There's a lot of theories about Gates. I can't speculate right now until more information comes up.
[2:47:48.920 --> 2:47:58.920]  But I think he's there. Well, okay, my guess is a lot of new information is about to come out about Gates, perhaps related to Maxwell and court cases.
[2:47:58.920 --> 2:48:04.920]  That's my guess. But that's just a guess. I don't have solid intel on that, so I won't speculate further.
[2:48:04.920 --> 2:48:16.920]  But there are major actions in play here. It's going to look very bad for some period of time. But those of us who are dedicated to survival and America and to God, we can make it through.
[2:48:16.920 --> 2:48:24.920]  And that's the most important message I want to share today, Alex, with your audience in mind is don't give up. Don't let them win the psychological warfare.
[2:48:24.920 --> 2:48:30.920]  You can make it through. We can survive. We come from ancestors who were survivors and pioneers.
[2:48:30.920 --> 2:48:36.920]  They went across America in wagons through harsh winters. Hey, if they can make it, we can too.
[2:48:36.920 --> 2:48:41.920]  It's our job not to be victims, but to save people around us. We're going to be the leaders.
[2:48:41.920 --> 2:48:47.920]  Folks, if you think Mike and I and others are prominent now and people are like, oh my God, Tucker Carlson is Alex Jones now.
[2:48:47.920 --> 2:48:52.920]  Well, everybody's going to be Alex Jones because I just woke up earlier than other people. And Mike woke up the same time I did.
[2:48:52.920 --> 2:49:00.920]  Now everybody's going to get we were right once this all hits. And so we're going to have a real leg up on the enemy as long as we survive and persevere.
[2:49:00.920 --> 2:49:03.920]  Most of the left is going to die in their own cities.
[2:49:03.920 --> 2:49:10.920]  Well, exactly right. And even if you and I personally don't survive this because, you know, they are out to kill some of us.
[2:49:10.920 --> 2:49:17.920]  Even if we don't survive, the philosophy that we espouse will absolutely survive and it will live on.
[2:49:17.920 --> 2:49:23.920]  And this nation will be great again. And the left will have only achieved the mass extermination of themselves.
[2:49:23.920 --> 2:49:29.920]  96% of Democrats are taking the vaccine or plan to 96%.
[2:49:29.920 --> 2:49:35.920]  Have you ever felt the urgency, Mike, the urgency we feel now? I mean, is this just like 50 times the urgency I ever felt?
[2:49:35.920 --> 2:49:39.920]  I mean, my whole gut, my intellect knows, man, it's about to get crazy.
[2:49:39.920 --> 2:49:48.920]  Yeah. No, it is. You absolutely get it. And I get it. And we're very open with our audiences here that we don't know how long we'll be on the air.
[2:49:48.920 --> 2:49:55.920]  We don't know how long the food supply chains will function. We don't know how long there will be any remaining rule of law in this nation.
[2:49:55.920 --> 2:50:02.920]  We have no idea. It could be weeks or months away. We don't know if the power grid is going to function tomorrow. We absolutely do not know.
[2:50:02.920 --> 2:50:11.920]  You start just suddenly with the police walking off, the border collapse, it's already happening, and just suddenly things are burning, suddenly the electricity's off, and then you're just the rest of your life.
[2:50:11.920 --> 2:50:23.920]  Well, and also just look historically at the fall of the Soviet Union. So one day they defaulted on, you know, $90 billion, I think, in national debt, you know, the equivalent of treasured bills.
[2:50:23.920 --> 2:50:31.920]  And then three days later, all the regions declared their own independence and sovereignty and the whole system fell apart, boom, just like that.
[2:50:31.920 --> 2:50:42.920]  And that's why that metaphor, that collapsing Miami condo, again, God bless those people, I'm not trying to belittle the event, but it's a metaphor for what's happening in our society.
[2:50:42.920 --> 2:50:49.920]  And once the collapse begins, it accelerates at the speed of gravity. This can happen overnight. Overnight the banks don't function.
[2:50:49.920 --> 2:51:00.920]  Overnight no ATMs. Overnight no more transactional capability in commercial sectors, including transportation, grocery, you know, anything, fuel, refineries, everything.
[2:51:00.920 --> 2:51:11.920]  And then you wake up next week, and the society you once knew is over. You've woken up in a futuristic, apocalyptic, post-nuclear, you know, scenario.
[2:51:11.920 --> 2:51:17.920]  Mike, you've got to join me in next week for, and I've got to see you in over a year, I hope you come to the studio with us, to talk about solutions.
[2:51:17.920 --> 2:51:18.920]  Yeah, I haven't been there in a while.
[2:51:18.920 --> 2:51:24.920]  Yeah, solutions in what we do, because you're really always doing a great job, you're really hitting on all cylinders.
[2:51:24.920 --> 2:51:31.920]  Right now to talk about, how do we, is there any way to stop this in 60 seconds? Is there, in your view, any way to stop this?
[2:51:31.920 --> 2:51:38.920]  Well, honestly, no. Not to stop it, but to recover on the other side and then achieve victory, yes. But I don't think we can stop what's been said in the movie.
[2:51:38.920 --> 2:51:42.920]  So the plane is crashing, but can it be a survival crash?
[2:51:42.920 --> 2:51:52.920]  Well, absolutely. Right. The plane is crashing. Some of us have parachutes, and we can bail out of this plane, and we can then rebuild after the crash. That's my assessment.
[2:51:52.920 --> 2:52:01.920]  Listen, I see the globalists, I see their leaders, they all look scared as hell, because they're puppets. They know what's about to happen. They're scared. They should be.
[2:52:01.920 --> 2:52:07.920]  Yeah, they should be. Because they're going to be impacted by it too, and they're also destroying their own voter base, by the way.
[2:52:07.920 --> 2:52:15.920]  There would be mass murder across Democrats because of spike protein. So, you know, the whole landscape is going to be changed from here forward.
[2:52:15.920 --> 2:52:21.920]  These are the last days of anything we recognize. The history once knew is over.
[2:52:21.920 --> 2:52:26.920]  We live to see the New World Order, Mike. We live to be in it, man. Wow, thanks so much.
[2:52:26.920 --> 2:52:27.920]  Thank you, Mike.
[2:52:27.920 --> 2:52:28.920]  Thank you.
[2:52:28.920 --> 2:52:34.920]  Actualnews.com and InfoWars.com. We'll do five more minutes and a hand of a ton to the guest hosts that's coming up.
[2:52:34.920 --> 2:52:40.920]  I'm sorry, folks. What up? You just heard the truth, OK? Get right with Jesus right now.
[2:52:40.920 --> 2:52:48.920]  In 60 seconds, I have a really bad tendency about going into too much detail, but listeners and viewers know that I straight shoot you.
[2:52:48.920 --> 2:52:58.920]  The last thing I would do is BS you. I personally have a reminder on the calendar on my phone that at least once a week I've got to take Survival Shield X2 or X3.
[2:52:58.920 --> 2:53:05.920]  Because when I don't, my energy, my stamina, my libido, my focus, everything is not half as good as it should be.
[2:53:05.920 --> 2:53:12.920]  This is a product system that everyone should be taking because it's not just a product. It is essential in the body.
[2:53:12.920 --> 2:53:21.920]  And most iodine is found in the food you get. Most people are very deficient in it. So we have X2 for 50% off with pre-shipping and double-patriot points.
[2:53:21.920 --> 2:53:30.920]  X3, 60% off pre-shipping and double-patriot points running through July 4th because I want you to experience X2 and X3, particularly X3.
[2:53:30.920 --> 2:53:34.920]  I'm not saying it's better than X2, but this is something that can really benefit everybody and it funds the InfoWars.
[2:53:34.920 --> 2:53:44.920]  To get your X2 and X3 with pre-shipping, massive discounts now at infowarscore.com.
[2:53:44.920 --> 2:53:55.920]  What are champions made of? Here's a man who can show you.
[2:53:55.920 --> 2:54:07.920]  Trouble 82533139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[2:54:07.920 --> 2:54:27.920]  Trouble 82533139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[2:54:27.920 --> 2:54:37.920]  Trouble 82533139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[2:54:37.920 --> 2:54:47.920]  Trouble 82533139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[2:54:47.920 --> 2:54:57.920]  Trouble 82533139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[2:54:57.920 --> 2:55:02.920]  You know, that was the most powerful hour of radio, most important I've ever done.
[2:55:02.920 --> 2:55:09.920]  You know, next week I'll probably do something even more powerful because it's the times we all live in.
[2:55:09.920 --> 2:55:17.920]  We live in epic and same times. Every instinct I've got is get gasoline tanks in, get all your solar in,
[2:55:17.920 --> 2:55:23.920]  I've gotten part of it in and just protect your family because this is the takedown of civilization.
[2:55:23.920 --> 2:55:28.920]  They wouldn't launch a deadly bio weapon like this to the vaccine.
[2:55:28.920 --> 2:55:32.920]  I keep going back to this because this is, I've studied warfare, I've studied the globalist,
[2:55:32.920 --> 2:55:37.920]  I've studied next generation warfare that is even in textbooks, I've lived it and learned it.
[2:55:37.920 --> 2:55:42.920]  They don't hit you with something this deadly unless they got something ten times worse about to happen
[2:55:42.920 --> 2:55:45.920]  so they're going to get away with that attack, you understand?
[2:55:45.920 --> 2:55:53.920]  I mean, they wouldn't have done this. I mean, Bill Gates, all of them are going to go to supermax prisons for what they've done.
[2:55:53.920 --> 2:55:58.920]  Except they're going to turn the damn power grid off and even before Schwab came out last week and said,
[2:55:58.920 --> 2:56:01.920]  we're going to turn your power off, what have I been saying for the last year?
[2:56:01.920 --> 2:56:05.920]  I know how the enemy's going to hit us. That's all I do is think about this stuff.
[2:56:05.920 --> 2:56:10.920]  And now the monster is up there just about to have an orgasm like I'd be far away.
[2:56:10.920 --> 2:56:16.920]  It needs to be nothing what you've seen with the shutdown, the lockdown.
[2:56:16.920 --> 2:56:22.920]  This will destroy civilization. Oh, it's so terrible. I'm so sad for you.
[2:56:22.920 --> 2:56:27.920]  When he's busy constantly shooting his mouth off about how beautiful the lockdowns are
[2:56:27.920 --> 2:56:34.920]  and how nice it is to see you starving.
[2:56:34.920 --> 2:56:39.920]  You're like, well, he'll never get away with it. He's a psychotic killer.
[2:56:39.920 --> 2:56:44.920]  He can't help it. You wonder like these pedophiles go grab kids out of backyards and rape them.
[2:56:44.920 --> 2:56:51.920]  You're like, you're going to go to jail for that. They can't help themselves.
[2:56:51.920 --> 2:56:57.920]  And there's a sick part of me that sees the decadent liberals and the idiots and how they're going to love the collapse.
[2:56:57.920 --> 2:57:04.920]  They went along with this. They're going to be like army ants marching against us and organize as political weapons.
[2:57:04.920 --> 2:57:11.920]  Because they're not going to keep the collapse going too long just enough to get them into a howling mob of crazies.
[2:57:11.920 --> 2:57:18.920]  And then it's going to start a giant flaming civil war, which I have no desire for.
[2:57:18.920 --> 2:57:24.920]  I've done everything I can to stop this.
[2:57:24.920 --> 2:57:34.920]  And once you initiate the stuff that the UN and Schwab and Gates have done,
[2:57:34.920 --> 2:57:42.920]  once you start things like this, you don't turn them off. You can't turn it off.
[2:57:42.920 --> 2:57:50.920]  Well, I'm sure army intelligence will stop them and all that delusional Q crap.
[2:57:50.920 --> 2:57:55.920]  The left is a cult of mindless idiots. They will do whatever they're told.
[2:57:55.920 --> 2:58:05.920]  They'll take their newborn babies in for deadly experimental injections.
[2:58:05.920 --> 2:58:11.920]  God has left us because we rejected God and God has lifted the hedge of protection.
[2:58:11.920 --> 2:58:17.920]  God will individually protect those of us to a certain extent if it's part of God's plan.
[2:58:17.920 --> 2:58:22.920]  I wouldn't blame God if he blew the whole damn planet up at this point.
[2:58:22.920 --> 2:58:24.920]  But that's not the plan. We already know the plan.
[2:58:24.920 --> 2:58:28.920]  We're going to get hurt bad. We're going to get chewed on by the New World Order.
[2:58:28.920 --> 2:58:32.920]  Satan's going to have a big old fun party raping the hell out of us.
[2:58:32.920 --> 2:58:36.920]  And so we can experience those babies have gone through and then it's all going to get cleaned up.
[2:58:36.920 --> 2:58:44.920]  But it's going to be rough, folks, so you better get down on your knees and close to Jesus.
[2:58:44.920 --> 2:58:47.920]  And just get ready.
[2:58:47.920 --> 2:58:53.920]  And I'm a tough guy, but I don't know how to face something this satanic.
[2:58:53.920 --> 2:58:59.920]  I mean, I can feel it and I can see it. The time for us being on air is almost set it in.
[2:58:59.920 --> 2:59:04.920]  The time of us talking is almost over. And then we're all just going to be sucked under by the current.
[2:59:04.920 --> 2:59:08.920]  Like we got grabbed by a riptide and you're going to have to try to get up for air.
[2:59:08.920 --> 2:59:14.920]  We're about to just the lights are about to go off, folks, figuratively and literally.
[2:59:14.920 --> 2:59:22.920]  And we might have a month, we might have two years, but the enemy is committed under their God to kill people.
[2:59:22.920 --> 2:59:28.920]  And so I'm just telling you, get ready, get prepared and buy all the products you can at informerstore.com.
[2:59:28.920 --> 2:59:34.920]  So I have a war chest as long as the bank works, try to keep this place going and maybe give the crew a bonus thing and try to get ready.
[2:59:34.920 --> 2:59:38.920]  Because I'd give it about an 80% chance they're going to turn the lights out. All right.
[2:59:38.920 --> 2:59:42.920]  All right, we got a great guest host coming up in the War Room 3PM Central.
[2:59:42.920 --> 3:00:09.920]  Let's work hard for this horrible future doesn't happen, but right now that's the course we're on.
[3:00:16.920 --> 3:00:23.920]  Pre shipping and double patriot points, all water filtration systems are 10% off and the list goes on and on.
[3:00:23.920 --> 3:00:31.920]  And while this sale runs, we're going to be adding new specials every day that are one day specials alone because we don't have enough supplies to keep them on sale.
[3:00:31.920 --> 3:00:41.920]  So the stuff I just listed is going to be on sale through July 4th, but every day visit informerstore.com because there's going to be new specials of select items with free shipping and double patriot points.
[3:00:41.920 --> 3:00:44.920]  Up to 60% off at informerstore.com.
[3:00:44.920 --> 3:01:12.920]  The 4th of July Super Sale starts now at informerstore.com.
[3:01:12.920 --> 3:01:15.920]  What a crazy, crazy week of information.
[3:01:15.920 --> 3:01:23.920]  Just, I mean, waterfalls of evidence, just the highest mountains of proof still being ignored by the mainstream media.
[3:01:23.920 --> 3:01:24.920]  What a crazy week.
[3:01:24.920 --> 3:01:25.920]  Happy Independence Day weekend, everybody.
[3:01:25.920 --> 3:01:27.920]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[3:01:27.920 --> 3:01:28.920]  Final 4th hour here.
[3:01:28.920 --> 3:01:32.920]  My name is Stu Peters and you can find me at stupeters.tv.
[3:01:32.920 --> 3:01:33.920]  I hope that you will.
[3:01:33.920 --> 3:01:35.920]  I promise you to never lie to you.
[3:01:35.920 --> 3:01:37.920]  I promise to always expose the truth no matter what it takes.
[3:01:37.920 --> 3:01:43.920]  You'll not find me on Twitter today, however, because of the exposure that I'm going to talk about shortly.
[3:01:43.920 --> 3:01:52.920]  The fact is this, the government, the globalists, the deep state cabal that wants you dead has a plan to put you inside of a bubble.
[3:01:52.920 --> 3:02:04.920]  Remember those bubbles that we talked about, the ones that we saw on the television, the ones that the mainstream media was just celebrating, the ones that they were trapping these young band students inside of when we were returning to normal, the new normal.
[3:02:04.920 --> 3:02:10.920]  And they had these BAM students literally playing their instruments in a bubble.
[3:02:10.920 --> 3:02:13.920]  Now imagine those bubbles, if you will, inside of your head.
[3:02:13.920 --> 3:02:14.920]  Just picture that.
[3:02:14.920 --> 3:02:17.920]  This is what they're trying to do to your entire life.
[3:02:17.920 --> 3:02:28.920]  They're trying to do this to your financial existence, to your transportation, your ability to travel, your purchasing power, your faith, your freedom to speak, your social interaction.
[3:02:28.920 --> 3:02:32.920]  They want to put it all in one bubble so that they can harness all of this stuff, right?
[3:02:32.920 --> 3:02:36.920]  There's one main power cord that runs to your bubble.
[3:02:36.920 --> 3:02:39.920]  Each person has their own bubble, their own identifier.
[3:02:39.920 --> 3:02:41.920]  It controls your health care.
[3:02:41.920 --> 3:02:43.920]  It controls everything about you.
[3:02:43.920 --> 3:02:51.920]  Every single thing about you, what you eat, where you shop, what you buy, all of these things are all in your bubble identified with your number.
[3:02:51.920 --> 3:02:55.920]  There's this power cord then that runs to a switch.
[3:02:55.920 --> 3:03:03.920]  And there's, at the end of that switch, the fingers that are on that switch are those controlled by the deep state global cabal.
[3:03:03.920 --> 3:03:05.920]  The people that want you dead.
[3:03:05.920 --> 3:03:14.920]  The people that are trying to hide the fact that 82% of pregnant women that participated in a vaccine trial experienced spontaneous abortion, miscarriages, lost their babies.
[3:03:14.920 --> 3:03:16.920]  But they still want you to get this.
[3:03:16.920 --> 3:03:22.920]  They absolutely cannot stop now that this bio weapon has met some resistance.
[3:03:22.920 --> 3:03:24.920]  They have to force you to get it.
[3:03:24.920 --> 3:03:36.920]  I've talked to people inside of the military, very credible people who have told me absolutely unequivocally that the armed forces is going to mandate this for every single uniformed military personnel.
[3:03:36.920 --> 3:03:38.920]  Pilots are calling me.
[3:03:38.920 --> 3:03:39.920]  They're texting me.
[3:03:39.920 --> 3:03:41.920]  They're emailing me.
[3:03:41.920 --> 3:03:43.920]  Every single airline pilot is going to have this.
[3:03:43.920 --> 3:03:49.920]  These people don't care about your life because they have proven that they want you dead.
[3:03:49.920 --> 3:03:57.920]  So they don't care if hundreds of planes are falling from the sky loaded with hundreds of people and you die in a fiery nose crash to the ground.
[3:03:57.920 --> 3:04:03.920]  They just don't care about people falling to their death and meeting their maker from 36 or 40,000 feet.
[3:04:03.920 --> 3:04:05.920]  They don't care about that.
[3:04:05.920 --> 3:04:06.920]  They want you quiet.
[3:04:06.920 --> 3:04:08.920]  They want you dead.
[3:04:08.920 --> 3:04:15.920]  So a lot of people are saying to me today when I mentioned this Twitter suspension, wow, we saw that coming.
[3:04:15.920 --> 3:04:20.920]  Well, of course, you know, of course you got banned from Twitter, but where did this acceptance come from?
[3:04:20.920 --> 3:04:23.920]  This acceptance is 100% poisonous.
[3:04:23.920 --> 3:04:26.920]  It's completely toxic to our very existence.
[3:04:26.920 --> 3:04:28.920]  We're not talking about the United States of America.
[3:04:28.920 --> 3:04:30.920]  We're not talking about Australia.
[3:04:30.920 --> 3:04:31.920]  We're not talking about the UK.
[3:04:31.920 --> 3:04:35.920]  We're not talking about China or any country exclusively, Canada.
[3:04:35.920 --> 3:04:37.920]  We're not talking about Canada.
[3:04:37.920 --> 3:04:39.920]  We are talking about a concerted global effort.
[3:04:39.920 --> 3:04:53.920]  And once you understand that, once you're able to wrap your head around the fact that we are so much more alike than we are different from every one of the people in every one of those countries that I mentioned where this broadcast is being transmitted to.
[3:04:53.920 --> 3:04:57.920]  We are all brothers and sisters.
[3:04:57.920 --> 3:05:01.920]  But that unity is destructive to the plan of the globalists and imagine a billion people.
[3:05:01.920 --> 3:05:07.920]  Just imagine a billion people in this world resisting this.
[3:05:07.920 --> 3:05:10.920]  We see what's happening to individuals who are resisting this.
[3:05:10.920 --> 3:05:11.920]  They're being targeted.
[3:05:11.920 --> 3:05:12.920]  They're being arrested.
[3:05:12.920 --> 3:05:13.920]  They're being jailed.
[3:05:13.920 --> 3:05:15.920]  They're being stripped of their right to speak freely.
[3:05:15.920 --> 3:05:18.920]  And it's not okay that I was deleted from Twitter.
[3:05:18.920 --> 3:05:21.920]  I don't care that Twitter is a crap platform.
[3:05:21.920 --> 3:05:26.920]  I don't care that we all recognize that they're funded by the same globalist cabal that wants you dead.
[3:05:26.920 --> 3:05:28.920]  I don't care that we have that knowledge.
[3:05:28.920 --> 3:05:29.920]  That's fine.
[3:05:29.920 --> 3:05:32.920]  Of course we all do, but it's not okay.
[3:05:32.920 --> 3:05:33.920]  They use that platform.
[3:05:33.920 --> 3:05:36.920]  They completely removed the president of the United States.
[3:05:36.920 --> 3:05:39.920]  It's kind of a big deal.
[3:05:39.920 --> 3:05:41.920]  Imagine living in those times.
[3:05:41.920 --> 3:05:44.920]  Imagine actually being here talking about something like that.
[3:05:44.920 --> 3:05:48.920]  If I would have mentioned this five years ago, you would have told me that I lost my mind.
[3:05:48.920 --> 3:05:51.920]  You would have baker-acted me and you would have had me force-medicated.
[3:05:51.920 --> 3:05:55.920]  You would have had me kidnapped by the very people that are trying to kidnap us now.
[3:05:55.920 --> 3:06:02.920]  But those bubbles that the media was so happy to brag about, those bubbles that our kids were playing their instruments in,
[3:06:02.920 --> 3:06:09.920]  those bubbles will include everything about you and that switches control by the hand of the globalists.
[3:06:09.920 --> 3:06:15.920]  Completely unchecked, deep state communists that have absolutely toppled an entire political system
[3:06:15.920 --> 3:06:21.920]  turned the United States of America, the world's last remaining superpower, completely upside down,
[3:06:21.920 --> 3:06:26.920]  tackled the West, stolen every right that you have, locked you down, canceled out your vote,
[3:06:26.920 --> 3:06:31.920]  forced you into a muzzle, mandated a needle into your arm, burned down your cities,
[3:06:31.920 --> 3:06:35.920]  taken your kids from you, canceled your voice, stolen your liberty, crushed your freedom,
[3:06:35.920 --> 3:06:39.920]  shredded the Constitution, they have stripped you of your military protection
[3:06:39.920 --> 3:06:42.920]  and the protection that is supposed to be provided to you by your local, county, state,
[3:06:42.920 --> 3:06:47.920]  and federal law enforcement agencies without firing a single shot.
[3:06:47.920 --> 3:06:53.920]  Not only do they not protect you, but those agencies that you have been raised to entrust with your safety
[3:06:53.920 --> 3:06:58.920]  and the safety of your property, the lives of your loved ones has actually now been weaponized against you,
[3:06:58.920 --> 3:07:01.920]  the New Age Nazi brown shirts.
[3:07:01.920 --> 3:07:04.920]  I'm not overstating this.
[3:07:04.920 --> 3:07:09.920]  I want you to be perfectly clear about exactly what it is that I'm trying to state here,
[3:07:09.920 --> 3:07:11.920]  that I want you to understand it.
[3:07:11.920 --> 3:07:16.920]  Any acceptance to this is absolute poison.
[3:07:16.920 --> 3:07:18.920]  So this whole, well, we saw that coming.
[3:07:18.920 --> 3:07:19.920]  I'm not okay with that.
[3:07:19.920 --> 3:07:20.920]  Come on.
[3:07:20.920 --> 3:07:24.920]  Chris Skye is a Canadian patriot, but he's so much more than that.
[3:07:24.920 --> 3:07:28.920]  Like Alex Jones, like me, like Owen Schreuer, like a handful of others,
[3:07:28.920 --> 3:07:35.920]  truthfully reporting and putting it all on the line, risking the very targeting that I was referencing.
[3:07:35.920 --> 3:07:36.920]  This isn't about one country.
[3:07:36.920 --> 3:07:38.920]  Like I said, this is about mankind.
[3:07:38.920 --> 3:07:40.920]  This is a real fight for humanity.
[3:07:40.920 --> 3:07:43.920]  And we're all so much more alike than we are different.
[3:07:43.920 --> 3:07:45.920]  I don't care where you're from.
[3:07:45.920 --> 3:07:48.920]  Realizing that this is a concerted effort is extremely important.
[3:07:48.920 --> 3:07:53.920]  Every single person on this planet is who they will demand subservience from.
[3:07:53.920 --> 3:07:57.920]  And if they don't get it, they will imprison you or kill you.
[3:07:57.920 --> 3:08:01.920]  Until you understand that, you're just living in an ignorant state of bliss.
[3:08:01.920 --> 3:08:06.920]  And that is the complacency that has gotten us to this point.
[3:08:06.920 --> 3:08:11.920]  Chris Skye is acting in Canada, but on behalf of every free person on the face of the planet,
[3:08:11.920 --> 3:08:12.920]  just like me.
[3:08:12.920 --> 3:08:14.920]  He's not surprised that he's being targeted,
[3:08:14.920 --> 3:08:17.920]  but I think it's important for us to illustrate just exactly how.
[3:08:17.920 --> 3:08:22.920]  And maybe most importantly, nobody has ever stopped me dead in my tracks.
[3:08:22.920 --> 3:08:26.920]  That bubble that I was talking about, that digital existence, if you will.
[3:08:26.920 --> 3:08:32.920]  Chris Skye yesterday blew me out of the water with how plainly he articulated this,
[3:08:32.920 --> 3:08:35.920]  how he simplified it so that anybody can understand.
[3:08:35.920 --> 3:08:38.920]  I'm convinced Howard Stern could understand.
[3:08:38.920 --> 3:08:41.920]  And we welcome Chris Skye for the rest of this segment,
[3:08:41.920 --> 3:08:43.920]  and we're going to hold him over for the next.
[3:08:43.920 --> 3:08:47.920]  Chris, there was a flyer that was sent out to the masses, a flyer about an event.
[3:08:47.920 --> 3:08:53.920]  Your name in bold letters drawing from what I can tell about 100,000 people to one place
[3:08:53.920 --> 3:08:57.920]  to hear you speak in front of the Supreme Court on Canada Day yesterday.
[3:08:57.920 --> 3:08:59.920]  That flyer, your name in bold.
[3:08:59.920 --> 3:09:01.920]  That was your event.
[3:09:01.920 --> 3:09:03.920]  Am I right?
[3:09:03.920 --> 3:09:08.920]  Well, I won't say it was my event, but I was definitely the main speaker for the event.
[3:09:08.920 --> 3:09:12.920]  And I was probably the main reason why the vast majority of people wanted to show up,
[3:09:12.920 --> 3:09:16.920]  because I have been touring all around Canada and parts of the world,
[3:09:16.920 --> 3:09:18.920]  speaking about exactly what you said.
[3:09:18.920 --> 3:09:20.920]  This is about control.
[3:09:20.920 --> 3:09:24.920]  This isn't about our safety, and this is about bringing everybody together,
[3:09:24.920 --> 3:09:29.920]  uniting everybody to get them to just say no to the agenda in general,
[3:09:29.920 --> 3:09:32.920]  the vaccines, the vaccine, passports, and everything else.
[3:09:32.920 --> 3:09:34.920]  And that's what this event has been about.
[3:09:34.920 --> 3:09:37.920]  Last year in Ottawa on Canada Day, it was about the same thing.
[3:09:37.920 --> 3:09:41.920]  It was about unity, and it was about getting people to say no to these draconian measures.
[3:09:41.920 --> 3:09:47.920]  Now all of a sudden, it got hijacked by a few politicians who made it about their own political interests
[3:09:47.920 --> 3:09:50.920]  and tried to prevent me from speaking at the event.
[3:09:50.920 --> 3:09:52.920]  So they used me to draw the people there.
[3:09:52.920 --> 3:09:55.920]  Then when I got there, they tried to ostracize me, prevent me from speaking.
[3:09:55.920 --> 3:09:59.920]  When I told them, I was just going to ask the crowd if they wanted me to speak,
[3:09:59.920 --> 3:10:03.920]  they literally reported me to the RCMP to try to get me arrested,
[3:10:03.920 --> 3:10:05.920]  so I wouldn't be able to speak.
[3:10:05.920 --> 3:10:07.920]  That didn't work, so they let me speak.
[3:10:07.920 --> 3:10:12.920]  Then they cut my mic off halfway through and got some children to start singing
[3:10:12.920 --> 3:10:17.920]  so they could make it look like I went on stage and tried to get these kids to stop singing so I could speak.
[3:10:17.920 --> 3:10:23.920]  In reality, I'm just setting up another example of a patriot,
[3:10:23.920 --> 3:10:27.920]  a person that is standing up against the global cabal.
[3:10:27.920 --> 3:10:31.920]  And what I'm trying to explain to Chris is that this is not just about Canada.
[3:10:31.920 --> 3:10:34.920]  This is not just about the United States, and I'm really glad that you're here.
[3:10:34.920 --> 3:10:35.920]  I appreciate your time.
[3:10:35.920 --> 3:10:38.920]  I want you to stay here because we're going to go back with how you have been targeted
[3:10:38.920 --> 3:10:40.920]  and how every single person shouldn't say,
[3:10:40.920 --> 3:10:43.920]  well, this is in Canada, I don't believe this will never happen here
[3:10:43.920 --> 3:10:45.920]  because you are absolutely dead wrong.
[3:10:45.920 --> 3:10:47.920]  Chris Sky will be with us when we come back.
[3:10:47.920 --> 3:11:16.920]  Stick around, go nowhere.
[3:11:17.920 --> 3:11:22.920]  All water filtration systems are 10% off and the list goes on and on.
[3:11:22.920 --> 3:11:26.920]  And while this sale runs, we're going to be adding new specials every day
[3:11:26.920 --> 3:11:30.920]  that are one-day specials alone because we don't have enough supplies to keep them on sale.
[3:11:30.920 --> 3:11:33.920]  So the stuff I just listed is going to be on sale 3 July 4th,
[3:11:33.920 --> 3:11:38.920]  but every day visit infowarstore.com because there are going to be new specials of select items
[3:11:38.920 --> 3:11:43.920]  with free shipping and double-patriot points that are up to 60% off at infowarstore.com.
[3:11:43.920 --> 3:11:48.920]  The 4th of July Super Sale starts now at infowarstore.com.
[3:12:13.920 --> 3:12:15.920]  It is a building block of everything that goes on.
[3:12:15.920 --> 3:12:18.920]  The globalists work around the clock to make sure that we are deficient in iodine
[3:12:18.920 --> 3:12:23.920]  and have way too much of all the garbage halogens like chlorine, fluoride, bromine and others.
[3:12:23.920 --> 3:12:27.920]  We also have X3 and that's because some research scientists pointed out to me
[3:12:27.920 --> 3:12:32.920]  and I saw the research and it was true that some people can't absorb pure atomic iodine.
[3:12:32.920 --> 3:12:36.920]  So it's pure atomic iodine and the two other types that are also good for your body
[3:12:36.920 --> 3:12:38.920]  that some people get better benefits from.
[3:12:38.920 --> 3:12:39.920]  So it's apples and oranges.
[3:12:39.920 --> 3:12:45.920]  Both products are free shipping, double-patriot points, 50% off for survival shield X2
[3:12:45.920 --> 3:13:14.920]  and 60% off for X3 even though it's selling out right now.
[3:13:14.920 --> 3:13:15.920]  Find it right there.
[3:13:15.920 --> 3:13:18.920]  stupeters.tv, breaking right at the top of the page.
[3:13:18.920 --> 3:13:24.920]  Study 82% of pregnant women that received the quote vaccine experienced miscarriage.
[3:13:24.920 --> 3:13:28.920]  This is the stuff that they will not be able to continue hiding from us.
[3:13:28.920 --> 3:13:29.920]  From the majority.
[3:13:29.920 --> 3:13:31.920]  We are the majority.
[3:13:31.920 --> 3:13:36.920]  Some are willing right now and have gone to the extent of losing their careers,
[3:13:36.920 --> 3:13:40.920]  losing their freedom, being locked up and risk losing their lives.
[3:13:40.920 --> 3:13:43.920]  One of those guys is here with us right now, Chris Sky.
[3:13:43.920 --> 3:13:47.920]  So it was a short segment there and I want to get right back into this.
[3:13:47.920 --> 3:13:48.920]  You have been arrested.
[3:13:48.920 --> 3:13:49.920]  You have been targeted.
[3:13:49.920 --> 3:13:53.920]  You have had warrants issued for your arrest by the predictive crime unit.
[3:13:53.920 --> 3:13:56.920]  They have followed you around for events that didn't even happen that you didn't even speak at.
[3:13:56.920 --> 3:13:58.920]  Now you're at this event on Canada Day.
[3:13:58.920 --> 3:13:59.920]  You go to speak.
[3:13:59.920 --> 3:14:01.920]  They cut your microphone not once but twice.
[3:14:01.920 --> 3:14:04.920]  They frame you on the internet as interrupting a children's choir.
[3:14:04.920 --> 3:14:06.920]  Absolutely completely BS.
[3:14:06.920 --> 3:14:07.920]  Did not happen.
[3:14:07.920 --> 3:14:12.920]  And then you had to run again to flee and avoid arrest and prosecution.
[3:14:12.920 --> 3:14:17.920]  This is insane.
[3:14:17.920 --> 3:14:18.920]  It was.
[3:14:18.920 --> 3:14:19.920]  And then it didn't stop there.
[3:14:19.920 --> 3:14:22.920]  After we were done, we were just walking around the city trying to enjoy Canada Day
[3:14:22.920 --> 3:14:24.920]  and there was thousands and thousands of people out.
[3:14:24.920 --> 3:14:28.920]  And we had about 30 police officers literally following us around everywhere we went,
[3:14:28.920 --> 3:14:29.920]  like our own shadow.
[3:14:29.920 --> 3:14:31.920]  Like they expected us to do something.
[3:14:31.920 --> 3:14:32.920]  It was insane.
[3:14:32.920 --> 3:14:33.920]  It was only in Ottawa it was like that.
[3:14:33.920 --> 3:14:35.920]  The people here were very supportive.
[3:14:35.920 --> 3:14:36.920]  We were walking around.
[3:14:36.920 --> 3:14:39.920]  Everybody everywhere was happy to see us.
[3:14:39.920 --> 3:14:41.920]  So the mood here was good.
[3:14:41.920 --> 3:14:46.920]  And that's why they, and that's the problem because they tried to hijack Canada Day.
[3:14:46.920 --> 3:14:51.920]  They literally tried to cancel Canada Day and make it about you're only allowed to
[3:14:51.920 --> 3:14:55.920]  celebrate Canada Day if you're going to say that Canadians are horrible racist people
[3:14:55.920 --> 3:14:59.920]  that hate indigenous native people, which was absolutely ridiculous.
[3:14:59.920 --> 3:15:02.920]  They're trying to do the same thing in the United States with Independence Day.
[3:15:02.920 --> 3:15:07.920]  And the reason they're doing it is to try to destroy your national identity so they can
[3:15:07.920 --> 3:15:09.920]  further subjugate and control you.
[3:15:09.920 --> 3:15:13.920]  It's like you said, they want to turn, or like I said to you and you reiterated, they
[3:15:13.920 --> 3:15:16.920]  want to turn you into a blip on a screen that they can just turn off.
[3:15:16.920 --> 3:15:18.920]  And what do I mean by that?
[3:15:18.920 --> 3:15:22.920]  The vaccine passport took away your rights and freedoms and made them now government
[3:15:22.920 --> 3:15:26.920]  granted privileges predicated on you taking a forced inoculation.
[3:15:26.920 --> 3:15:28.920]  Now they closed your business and took your job.
[3:15:28.920 --> 3:15:30.920]  So you're financially dependent on them.
[3:15:30.920 --> 3:15:36.920]  Now they want to do digital ID, digital currency and merge that with your vaccine passport.
[3:15:36.920 --> 3:15:41.920]  At that point, they have complete control over every transaction you make.
[3:15:41.920 --> 3:15:46.920]  You won't even be able to sell your used shoes on eBay or another online website like Craigslist
[3:15:46.920 --> 3:15:50.920]  without them knowing what you're selling, having to get their permission, having them
[3:15:50.920 --> 3:15:53.920]  put it in the system and having them take their piece of the pie.
[3:15:53.920 --> 3:16:00.920]  And that literally turns you into a little blip on a screen where you are once an individual
[3:16:00.920 --> 3:16:04.920]  with rights and freedoms that could make a difference, that could make your own decisions
[3:16:04.920 --> 3:16:09.920]  that had your own bodily and physical and mental autonomy.
[3:16:09.920 --> 3:16:13.920]  And now they have complete control over you to the point where they flip a switch
[3:16:13.920 --> 3:16:15.920]  and you're taken out of society.
[3:16:15.920 --> 3:16:17.920]  That's what they want.
[3:16:17.920 --> 3:16:21.920]  And they're further going to restrict your freedoms, your freedom of your speech,
[3:16:21.920 --> 3:16:24.920]  your freedom of movement, your freedom to work.
[3:16:24.920 --> 3:16:27.920]  And they're going to erode your property rights.
[3:16:27.920 --> 3:16:31.920]  The next thing you're going to be hearing from these globalists is build back better.
[3:16:31.920 --> 3:16:35.920]  And it's not going to stop with lockdowns for viruses.
[3:16:35.920 --> 3:16:37.920]  The next thing we're going to have are climate lockdowns.
[3:16:37.920 --> 3:16:42.920]  They're going to start telling you that, oh, we need to curb human activity because we use too much electricity
[3:16:42.920 --> 3:16:46.920]  or too much fossil fuel or too much, we're causing too much carbon dioxide.
[3:16:46.920 --> 3:16:48.920]  And the only way to do that is to have another lockdown.
[3:16:48.920 --> 3:16:50.920]  So they got us used to these ideas of lockdowns.
[3:16:50.920 --> 3:16:55.920]  And as for these vaccines that we can't even call a vaccine because a vaccine by definition
[3:16:55.920 --> 3:17:00.920]  has to provide immunity and prevent transmission, which this does not do.
[3:17:00.920 --> 3:17:05.920]  They gave us this temporary lull in the virus because it's summertime, flu season is over.
[3:17:05.920 --> 3:17:09.920]  And because all these people got vaccinated, they needed to dangle the carrot in front of their face,
[3:17:09.920 --> 3:17:11.920]  which was, okay, you can take off your mask.
[3:17:11.920 --> 3:17:14.920]  Okay, you can have a semblance of freedom, except where I live in Ontario.
[3:17:14.920 --> 3:17:20.920]  In Ontario, Canada, we're still in the only province or state in entire North America
[3:17:20.920 --> 3:17:22.920]  where we can't even eat in a restaurant.
[3:17:22.920 --> 3:17:27.920]  But besides that, they're giving a little bit of freedom to most Canadians and Americans right now.
[3:17:27.920 --> 3:17:30.920]  And then when the fall comes around, they're going to lock us all down again.
[3:17:30.920 --> 3:17:34.920]  And they're going to come up with the idea, they already mentioned it, a Delta variant,
[3:17:34.920 --> 3:17:37.920]  and now they called a Delta plus variant.
[3:17:37.920 --> 3:17:39.920]  And what does the plus mean?
[3:17:39.920 --> 3:17:42.920]  They're telling you it's resistant to antibodies.
[3:17:42.920 --> 3:17:45.920]  That's double speaking for resistant to vaccines.
[3:17:45.920 --> 3:17:49.920]  Now, the vaccines are the only way that these new strains can develop
[3:17:49.920 --> 3:17:52.920]  because if you're vaccinated and the disease cannot replicate,
[3:17:52.920 --> 3:17:56.920]  the only way for the disease to survive is to mutate and evolve and to create a new variant.
[3:17:56.920 --> 3:18:00.920]  So the new variant is going to be created by all these experimental injections
[3:18:00.920 --> 3:18:07.920]  of four different companies being injected into millions and millions of people.
[3:18:07.920 --> 3:18:10.920]  They're going to blame the non-vaccinated people.
[3:18:10.920 --> 3:18:12.920]  The studies got locked out in the fall.
[3:18:12.920 --> 3:18:13.920]  They're going to make everyone wear masks.
[3:18:13.920 --> 3:18:16.920]  Everyone has the same restrictions whether you're vaccinated or not.
[3:18:16.920 --> 3:18:19.920]  And they're going to blame it on the unvaccinated.
[3:18:19.920 --> 3:18:21.920]  Well, the vaccinated are the ones that are going to be getting sick.
[3:18:21.920 --> 3:18:23.920]  That's when we're going to see it fall.
[3:18:23.920 --> 3:18:26.920]  This is over and done with.
[3:18:26.920 --> 3:18:29.920]  We're having some sort of a technical problem here.
[3:18:29.920 --> 3:18:36.920]  But what you're saying is really highlighting to me in some of the most plain talk
[3:18:36.920 --> 3:18:38.920]  that I think I have ever heard.
[3:18:38.920 --> 3:18:41.920]  I think you need to show over it seriously.
[3:18:41.920 --> 3:18:43.920]  I'd love to have you on.
[3:18:43.920 --> 3:18:47.920]  I mean, I've really never heard anybody articulate this so plainly
[3:18:47.920 --> 3:18:49.920]  and you do such a phenomenal job of doing that.
[3:18:49.920 --> 3:18:51.920]  Okay, so we've got about three minutes here.
[3:18:51.920 --> 3:18:53.920]  I want you to tell me this.
[3:18:53.920 --> 3:18:55.920]  We know the plan of the globalists.
[3:18:55.920 --> 3:18:57.920]  What is the plan of Chris Sky?
[3:18:57.920 --> 3:19:01.920]  How do we stop this from making this final turn?
[3:19:01.920 --> 3:19:04.920]  It's called United Non-Compliance.
[3:19:04.920 --> 3:19:09.920]  That's everybody coming together regardless of all the ways they're trying to divide us.
[3:19:09.920 --> 3:19:10.920]  People scared of the virus.
[3:19:10.920 --> 3:19:12.920]  People who want to wear masks.
[3:19:12.920 --> 3:19:14.920]  People who are on government assistance.
[3:19:14.920 --> 3:19:16.920]  People who still have their jobs.
[3:19:16.920 --> 3:19:20.920]  They're trying to divide us with race, with AIDS, with ethnicity.
[3:19:20.920 --> 3:19:23.920]  With people who have different political affiliations.
[3:19:23.920 --> 3:19:25.920]  Every single way they can.
[3:19:25.920 --> 3:19:27.920]  Because the more they divide us, the smaller our voices.
[3:19:27.920 --> 3:19:31.920]  My term, United Non-Compliance, is everybody coming together
[3:19:31.920 --> 3:19:35.920]  regardless of any difference they can try to bring up for one cause.
[3:19:35.920 --> 3:19:38.920]  And that cause is the restoration of our rights and freedoms
[3:19:38.920 --> 3:19:40.920]  and saving our country.
[3:19:40.920 --> 3:19:44.920]  And that's where the slogan just say no comes from.
[3:19:44.920 --> 3:19:47.920]  And phase one of United Non-Compliance was the global awakening.
[3:19:47.920 --> 3:19:51.920]  And we spent a year waking up millions, if not billions of people to the idea
[3:19:51.920 --> 3:19:54.920]  that this isn't about health and safety, this is about control.
[3:19:54.920 --> 3:19:56.920]  Phase two is 2021.
[3:19:56.920 --> 3:19:58.920]  And it's called taking action.
[3:19:58.920 --> 3:20:00.920]  And it's when we get the groups of protesters that we have
[3:20:00.920 --> 3:20:04.920]  and we give them actionable intent that they can do to make a difference.
[3:20:04.920 --> 3:20:08.920]  We have the small business owners banding together to make sure they can open.
[3:20:08.920 --> 3:20:13.920]  We have concerned parents attacking school boards to make sure their kids can be masked and restriction free.
[3:20:13.920 --> 3:20:18.920]  We have employees coming together to go against mandatory vaccination at their workplace.
[3:20:18.920 --> 3:20:23.920]  And lastly, we have concerned citizens that are going against the mask banding.
[3:20:23.920 --> 3:20:28.920]  And to show how this can work, like you said, they're targeting people like me.
[3:20:28.920 --> 3:20:30.920]  They're coming after us with everything they got.
[3:20:30.920 --> 3:20:32.920]  I went into a grocery store called Longos without a mask
[3:20:32.920 --> 3:20:35.920]  and it ended up with 40 police officers at my house
[3:20:35.920 --> 3:20:37.920]  without a warrant trying to kidnap me in the middle of the night.
[3:20:37.920 --> 3:20:40.920]  60 other people did the exact same thing as me.
[3:20:40.920 --> 3:20:43.920]  Unified and non-compliant. And guess what?
[3:20:43.920 --> 3:20:46.920]  Not only did they not get arrested and sworn by the Gestapo,
[3:20:46.920 --> 3:20:50.920]  Longos, the story in question, was forced to change their policy.
[3:20:50.920 --> 3:20:52.920]  That's the power of united non-compliance.
[3:20:52.920 --> 3:20:56.920]  And that's how we get out of this by stopping their agenda in its tracks,
[3:20:56.920 --> 3:21:00.920]  by just saying no to the vaccine, the vaccine passports, the business closures
[3:21:00.920 --> 3:21:04.920]  and all the other restrictions and forcing them back to our normal.
[3:21:04.920 --> 3:21:06.920]  Not their new normal.
[3:21:06.920 --> 3:21:08.920]  There is no such thing as a new normal.
[3:21:08.920 --> 3:21:11.920]  There's only normal and what they're trying to create.
[3:21:11.920 --> 3:21:15.920]  And what they're trying to create is a hell on earth for the average citizen
[3:21:15.920 --> 3:21:20.920]  and a totally technocratic medical control grid, period.
[3:21:20.920 --> 3:21:22.920]  Absolutely, 100%.
[3:21:22.920 --> 3:21:26.920]  Chris Sky, God bless you, man. I really love, I enjoy talking to you.
[3:21:26.920 --> 3:21:28.920]  And I'm happy and proud to be an ally of yours.
[3:21:28.920 --> 3:21:32.920]  Chris Sky, get his book, just say no, RealChrisSky.com.
[3:21:32.920 --> 3:21:35.920]  Coming up in the next segment, Dr. Jane Ruby will be here.
[3:21:35.920 --> 3:21:39.920]  We're going to be talking about this phenomenon of magnetic food.
[3:21:39.920 --> 3:21:43.920]  She has uncovered some details that led directly to that Twitter suspension
[3:21:43.920 --> 3:21:47.920]  and I believe myself being under electronic surveillance details.
[3:21:47.920 --> 3:21:48.920]  Coming up on the other side.
[3:21:48.920 --> 3:21:52.920]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years
[3:21:52.920 --> 3:21:55.920]  has now gone from beta testing to operational.
[3:21:55.920 --> 3:21:59.920]  The globalists are out on the open with their planetary depopulation takeover,
[3:21:59.920 --> 3:22:01.920]  their robot takeover.
[3:22:01.920 --> 3:22:04.920]  But the good news is we've been working and you've been working
[3:22:04.920 --> 3:22:08.920]  across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to find it off.
[3:22:08.920 --> 3:22:10.920]  Humanity is strong. We're incredible.
[3:22:10.920 --> 3:22:14.920]  And if we're aware of the attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating it.
[3:22:14.920 --> 3:22:17.920]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[3:22:17.920 --> 3:22:21.920]  So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential,
[3:22:21.920 --> 3:22:23.920]  and warning others is absolutely essential.
[3:22:23.920 --> 3:22:27.920]  And at the same time, supporting info wars by buying high quality products
[3:22:27.920 --> 3:22:31.920]  to keep us on air is essential because they're great products for you and your family
[3:22:31.920 --> 3:22:33.920]  and they're also funding our operation.
[3:22:33.920 --> 3:22:38.920]  Infowarsstore.com. Infowarsstore.com is incredible.
[3:22:38.920 --> 3:22:41.920]  A lot of our products that have been sold out because the supply chain breakdowns
[3:22:41.920 --> 3:22:43.920]  are back in like bodies, vaso beats and others.
[3:22:43.920 --> 3:22:45.920]  So get them today at infowarsstore.com.
[3:22:45.920 --> 3:22:48.920]  And I thank you for being part of the resistance.
[3:22:51.920 --> 3:22:53.920]  The globalists are having their revolution.
[3:22:53.920 --> 3:22:56.920]  But for humanity has to have its revolution.
[3:22:56.920 --> 3:23:00.920]  We have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers
[3:23:00.920 --> 3:23:06.920]  trying to enslave the entire biological processes of humans
[3:23:06.920 --> 3:23:13.920]  and turn us into these artificial corporate controlled slaves.
[3:23:13.920 --> 3:23:18.920]  Orson slaves are just just property from cradle to grave of the system.
[3:23:18.920 --> 3:23:22.920]  Rendered down to be servile minions of the system
[3:23:22.920 --> 3:23:26.920]  and a ritual of dominance and safety and control.
[3:23:26.920 --> 3:23:29.920]  We have to recognize the great reset post-industrial world
[3:23:29.920 --> 3:23:31.920]  that realizes a nightmare dystopia.
[3:23:31.920 --> 3:23:33.920]  And we have to promote liberty and freedom
[3:23:33.920 --> 3:23:35.920]  that is the opposite of their dystopia.
[3:23:35.920 --> 3:23:37.920]  It's that choice.
[3:23:37.920 --> 3:23:39.920]  It's that realization that's going to change the world.
[3:23:39.920 --> 3:23:42.920]  And it's the only choice we've got.
[3:23:42.920 --> 3:23:44.920]  Freedom or slavery go to evil.
[3:23:44.920 --> 3:23:46.920]  It is a spiritual battle.
[3:23:46.920 --> 3:23:48.920]  And info wars at the tip of the spear fighting it.
[3:23:48.920 --> 3:23:52.920]  I'm a very humble person, but I'm also a bold person.
[3:23:52.920 --> 3:23:55.920]  And so as bad as things are with the globalist attack of humanity
[3:23:55.920 --> 3:23:57.920]  with all the terrible things that are unfolding
[3:23:57.920 --> 3:24:01.920]  I want you to know that a lot of positive things are happening as well.
[3:24:01.920 --> 3:24:05.920]  I'm a public figure, so I get to see things that the Republic doesn't get to see.
[3:24:05.920 --> 3:24:09.920]  And let me tell you, whether it's police chiefs or members of Congress
[3:24:09.920 --> 3:24:14.920]  or even folks in Hollywood or mainstream media or industry
[3:24:14.920 --> 3:24:17.920]  people are really, really away from the establishment.
[3:24:17.920 --> 3:24:19.920]  They don't want to go along with the globalists,
[3:24:19.920 --> 3:24:22.920]  but they're scared, they're looking for leadership.
[3:24:22.920 --> 3:24:24.920]  Well, that's where info wars comes in.
[3:24:24.920 --> 3:24:27.920]  You fund us, you support infowarstore.com,
[3:24:27.920 --> 3:24:29.920]  you get great products at the same time.
[3:24:29.920 --> 3:24:33.920]  We will then go out and do what the globalists say is unpopular
[3:24:33.920 --> 3:24:35.920]  what the globalists will target you for
[3:24:35.920 --> 3:24:38.920]  to show people that it's safe to tell the truth and to take the heat.
[3:24:38.920 --> 3:24:42.920]  That's our job, so please keep us on air
[3:24:42.920 --> 3:24:45.920]  so we can hit the barbed wire, so we can meet the shock groups
[3:24:45.920 --> 3:24:47.920]  and the information war.
[3:24:47.920 --> 3:24:54.920]  That's infowarstore.com.
[3:25:43.920 --> 3:25:46.920]  The Fourth of July Super Sale starts now.
[3:25:46.920 --> 3:25:49.920]  Get infowarstore.com.
[3:26:06.920 --> 3:26:09.920]  They tried to bury the Pfizer study where those kids
[3:26:09.920 --> 3:26:12.920]  had adverse events, nearly 80% of them.
[3:26:12.920 --> 3:26:14.920]  It's out there, it's documented.
[3:26:14.920 --> 3:26:16.920]  Fact checkers cannot dispute it.
[3:26:16.920 --> 3:26:19.920]  They tried to bury and hide 82%
[3:26:19.920 --> 3:26:22.920]  of inoculated pregnant women lost their babies.
[3:26:22.920 --> 3:26:25.920]  They tried to hide it, it's there, it's publicly discoverable,
[3:26:25.920 --> 3:26:27.920]  it's fact, it's at stupeeters.tv.
[3:26:27.920 --> 3:26:30.920]  They are trying to hide the connections about this
[3:26:30.920 --> 3:26:33.920]  magnetism phenomenon.
[3:26:33.920 --> 3:26:36.920]  It started in humans, thousands of self-recorded videos.
[3:26:36.920 --> 3:26:38.920]  It's now in food, people showing,
[3:26:38.920 --> 3:26:41.920]  I mean, I'm literally recommending that you take a magnet to the supermarket.
[3:26:41.920 --> 3:26:44.920]  That sounds more 10 half than anything I can think of.
[3:26:44.920 --> 3:26:46.920]  And we honor those people.
[3:26:46.920 --> 3:26:49.920]  Listen, I will tell you this.
[3:26:49.920 --> 3:26:53.920]  How have we forgotten about the human aspect of all of this?
[3:26:53.920 --> 3:26:56.920]  How can you humanize something that you're seeing on paper?
[3:26:56.920 --> 3:26:58.920]  I'm going to do my best to try.
[3:26:58.920 --> 3:27:02.920]  There's ID 1261766-1.
[3:27:02.920 --> 3:27:05.920]  One years old.
[3:27:05.920 --> 3:27:08.920]  Died two days after vaccination, increased body temperature,
[3:27:08.920 --> 3:27:11.920]  seizure, death.
[3:27:11.920 --> 3:27:15.920]  There's ID 1382906-1.
[3:27:15.920 --> 3:27:17.920]  15 years old.
[3:27:17.920 --> 3:27:19.920]  15 years old. Are you a mom? Are you a dad?
[3:27:19.920 --> 3:27:22.920]  Unexplained death within 48 hours.
[3:27:22.920 --> 3:27:26.920]  There's ID 1386841-1.
[3:27:26.920 --> 3:27:29.920]  16 years old.
[3:27:29.920 --> 3:27:31.920]  Sweet 16.
[3:27:31.920 --> 3:27:33.920]  Just getting ready to get a driver's license.
[3:27:33.920 --> 3:27:36.920]  Whole life ahead of this kid.
[3:27:36.920 --> 3:27:39.920]  Prodrom of a headache and gastric upset
[3:27:39.920 --> 3:27:42.920]  over two days following second dose, then felt fine.
[3:27:42.920 --> 3:27:46.920]  Found the following day dead in bed.
[3:27:46.920 --> 3:27:50.920]  Autopsy pending.
[3:27:50.920 --> 3:27:55.920]  Details for VAERS ID number 1406840-1.
[3:27:55.920 --> 3:27:57.920]  13 years old.
[3:27:57.920 --> 3:27:59.920]  Getting ready for high school.
[3:27:59.920 --> 3:28:01.920]  Excited about playing on the varsity basketball team.
[3:28:01.920 --> 3:28:03.920]  Playing football.
[3:28:03.920 --> 3:28:04.920]  First girlfriend.
[3:28:04.920 --> 3:28:07.920]  First job, maybe.
[3:28:07.920 --> 3:28:12.920]  Flu-like symptoms for two days, then found deceased.
[3:28:12.920 --> 3:28:17.920]  The list goes on and on and on and on.
[3:28:17.920 --> 3:28:20.920]  Dr. Jane Ruby joins us now.
[3:28:20.920 --> 3:28:24.920]  Dr. Jane, you brought the Spanish researcher's story
[3:28:24.920 --> 3:28:25.920]  to the forefront.
[3:28:25.920 --> 3:28:28.920]  More information that they tried to hide,
[3:28:28.920 --> 3:28:31.920]  but it's right out in the wide open.
[3:28:31.920 --> 3:28:34.920]  You brought it to InfoWars.
[3:28:34.920 --> 3:28:36.920]  You brought it to the Stu Peter show.
[3:28:36.920 --> 3:28:40.920]  You've showed these side-by-side pictures of these.
[3:28:40.920 --> 3:28:43.920]  It's just, I mean, it's satanic looking.
[3:28:43.920 --> 3:28:45.920]  The question I have for you, Dr. Ruby,
[3:28:45.920 --> 3:28:53.920]  why is Pfizer not holding a press conference right now?
[3:28:53.920 --> 3:28:56.920]  Stu, the only thing I can think of is that they don't feel
[3:28:56.920 --> 3:28:58.920]  the need to, and that's very frightening.
[3:28:58.920 --> 3:29:01.920]  Let me bring you an update to the story.
[3:29:01.920 --> 3:29:06.920]  The report of these Spanish researchers from a group,
[3:29:06.920 --> 3:29:08.920]  they're called themselves La Quinta Columna,
[3:29:08.920 --> 3:29:09.920]  the fifth column.
[3:29:09.920 --> 3:29:12.920]  The report is now out in English.
[3:29:12.920 --> 3:29:13.920]  Thank God.
[3:29:13.920 --> 3:29:14.920]  And I got it yesterday.
[3:29:14.920 --> 3:29:16.920]  I've been studying it ever since.
[3:29:16.920 --> 3:29:18.920]  Let me boil it down for everybody.
[3:29:18.920 --> 3:29:24.920]  These researchers in this group got a vial, a one vial.
[3:29:24.920 --> 3:29:25.920]  This is my understanding.
[3:29:25.920 --> 3:29:27.920]  I've looked at the methodology and what they've done.
[3:29:27.920 --> 3:29:30.920]  They got one vial that was sealed, verified,
[3:29:30.920 --> 3:29:34.920]  chain of custody of the Pfizer injection,
[3:29:34.920 --> 3:29:36.920]  whatever that is right now.
[3:29:36.920 --> 3:29:39.920]  And they put it under a regular microscope,
[3:29:39.920 --> 3:29:42.920]  and they saw something very startling.
[3:29:42.920 --> 3:29:47.920]  It looked like paper folded under a liquid contrast,
[3:29:47.920 --> 3:29:51.920]  like Kleenex underneath paint, if you will.
[3:29:51.920 --> 3:29:54.920]  And one of their experts said,
[3:29:54.920 --> 3:29:59.920]  that looks a lot like a very toxic compound graphene oxide.
[3:29:59.920 --> 3:30:03.920]  So they got hold of an electron microscope.
[3:30:03.920 --> 3:30:06.920]  Before we go to these pictures for me to explain what they found,
[3:30:06.920 --> 3:30:09.920]  I have a picture that I've provided to the producers
[3:30:09.920 --> 3:30:10.920]  with an electron microscope.
[3:30:10.920 --> 3:30:12.920]  It fills half the room.
[3:30:12.920 --> 3:30:15.920]  And to the right of that picture, you'll see on one of the screens
[3:30:15.920 --> 3:30:19.920]  where they started to bring up at the nanometer level
[3:30:19.920 --> 3:30:23.920]  of magnification, what was underneath that.
[3:30:23.920 --> 3:30:28.920]  Now, what you're looking at here is a part of the electron microscope.
[3:30:28.920 --> 3:30:33.920]  This is an amazing instrument that magnifies millions,
[3:30:33.920 --> 3:30:35.920]  I shouldn't say millions, thousands of times.
[3:30:35.920 --> 3:30:36.920]  I'm not a microscopy expert.
[3:30:36.920 --> 3:30:39.920]  I just know that I love electron microscopy
[3:30:39.920 --> 3:30:41.920]  because it gets right down to the cellular
[3:30:41.920 --> 3:30:44.920]  and then beneath into the molecular level.
[3:30:44.920 --> 3:30:48.920]  If you can bring back the picture that we had with the side-by-side,
[3:30:48.920 --> 3:30:51.920]  what they found blew them away, Stu.
[3:30:51.920 --> 3:30:56.920]  They had a picture, what you will see on your left
[3:30:56.920 --> 3:30:59.920]  is from the Pfizer vial.
[3:30:59.920 --> 3:31:02.920]  What you are seeing on your, and that's highlighted in green,
[3:31:02.920 --> 3:31:07.920]  the RD1 sample, that's 99%, they say,
[3:31:07.920 --> 3:31:09.920]  of what was inside the vial.
[3:31:09.920 --> 3:31:12.920]  They did extract some RNA material,
[3:31:12.920 --> 3:31:16.920]  but the majority of that vial was what you see on the left.
[3:31:16.920 --> 3:31:19.920]  What you're seeing on the right at 200 nanometers,
[3:31:19.920 --> 3:31:21.920]  just for a point of reference,
[3:31:21.920 --> 3:31:29.920]  Schupier at L2009 was a publication that was using graphene oxide,
[3:31:29.920 --> 3:31:34.920]  and they gave their electron microscope picture of it.
[3:31:34.920 --> 3:31:38.920]  So when they matched them up, they basically said,
[3:31:38.920 --> 3:31:40.920]  look, this is not 100% conclusive,
[3:31:40.920 --> 3:31:43.920]  we have more studies we need to do,
[3:31:43.920 --> 3:31:46.920]  but undeniably to the experts in the room,
[3:31:46.920 --> 3:31:51.920]  this vial from Pfizer, once they got it under the electron microscope,
[3:31:51.920 --> 3:31:55.920]  does look very clearly like real graphene oxide,
[3:31:55.920 --> 3:31:59.920]  and the shocking part is they point out that if you look on the right,
[3:31:59.920 --> 3:32:03.920]  you can see a better version of this black shear mesh
[3:32:03.920 --> 3:32:07.920]  that sort of entwines these globules, these horrible-looking globules,
[3:32:07.920 --> 3:32:11.920]  and it is also on the left in the Pfizer vial sample,
[3:32:11.920 --> 3:32:15.920]  and they say that that is part and parcel of the toxicity.
[3:32:15.920 --> 3:32:20.920]  So what they've said here at the end, to me,
[3:32:20.920 --> 3:32:24.920]  every time I see this image, I get very, very upset.
[3:32:24.920 --> 3:32:29.920]  Their conclusion was that this sample presents a high similarity
[3:32:29.920 --> 3:32:34.920]  with images of graphene oxide from the literature
[3:32:34.920 --> 3:32:39.920]  obtained from the same TEM technique, electron microscopy,
[3:32:39.920 --> 3:32:42.920]  with similar magnifications,
[3:32:42.920 --> 3:32:48.920]  and they call that black shear junk that's around these globules
[3:32:48.920 --> 3:32:54.920]  an intricate matrix or mesh of folded, translucent, flexible sheets can be observed.
[3:32:54.920 --> 3:32:58.920]  And there's a study out stew very, very recent
[3:32:58.920 --> 3:33:04.920]  that cites the propensity, if you will, of graphene oxide
[3:33:04.920 --> 3:33:08.920]  to cause blood clotting, a platelet disruption,
[3:33:08.920 --> 3:33:13.920]  platelet explosion, if you will, in vivo, in animals.
[3:33:13.920 --> 3:33:16.920]  So I'm very, very concerned about this.
[3:33:16.920 --> 3:33:19.920]  This is probably what's part of this, you know,
[3:33:19.920 --> 3:33:23.920]  explosion, if you will, of thrombotic episodes,
[3:33:23.920 --> 3:33:27.920]  people having blood clots, people just dropping dead of strokes
[3:33:27.920 --> 3:33:29.920]  when the clots break off.
[3:33:29.920 --> 3:33:30.920]  Is graphene oxide poisonous?
[3:33:30.920 --> 3:33:35.920]  Is graphene oxide something that you're supposed to put in your body?
[3:33:35.920 --> 3:33:39.920]  No, stew, and there are a lot of studies that I've been digging through
[3:33:39.920 --> 3:33:45.920]  that reflect previous research with animals and in the lab,
[3:33:45.920 --> 3:33:50.920]  with non-biological tissues, things like that, for industrial use.
[3:33:50.920 --> 3:33:53.920]  And there's warning after warning that, you know,
[3:33:53.920 --> 3:33:57.920]  more research needs to be done to see if this could be safely used
[3:33:57.920 --> 3:34:03.920]  or even diluted down and safely used in therapies and treatments.
[3:34:03.920 --> 3:34:06.920]  And stew, I'm going to say something that I think is really shocking,
[3:34:06.920 --> 3:34:12.920]  but when you look at all this, it looks like they're doing the experiment now.
[3:34:12.920 --> 3:34:16.920]  Well, you know, I mean, we released tapes of a Moderna spokesperson
[3:34:16.920 --> 3:34:20.920]  that was caught on the phone specifically saying every single person
[3:34:20.920 --> 3:34:22.920]  who takes this jab is part of a trial.
[3:34:22.920 --> 3:34:25.920]  And, you know, for the most part, we knew that,
[3:34:25.920 --> 3:34:29.920]  but it's really shocking to hear that from a spokesperson from the company
[3:34:29.920 --> 3:34:35.920]  that is profiting billions and billions and billions of dollars lobbying for boosters.
[3:34:35.920 --> 3:34:42.920]  We have now learned that pilots, not only are they all required to get jabbed,
[3:34:42.920 --> 3:34:50.920]  but these pilots are now being subjected to international, other countries' health mandates
[3:34:50.920 --> 3:34:53.920]  as it comes to masking, as it comes to these injections.
[3:34:53.920 --> 3:34:59.920]  What that means is that if country A says you have to have all of your boosters,
[3:34:59.920 --> 3:35:03.920]  in order to be on that flight, in order to captain that aircraft,
[3:35:03.920 --> 3:35:08.920]  no matter if you work for a company there or if you work for a company here in the United States,
[3:35:08.920 --> 3:35:13.920]  United, American, Delta, any of the above, you will be required to follow the laws
[3:35:13.920 --> 3:35:18.920]  or mandates of these other countries, third world countries included.
[3:35:18.920 --> 3:35:22.920]  They are going to booster every single one of these pilots.
[3:35:22.920 --> 3:35:27.920]  Now, briefly, before I had Chris Skyon, I mentioned these globalists do not care
[3:35:27.920 --> 3:35:31.920]  if there are planes loaded with hundreds of people falling from the sky,
[3:35:31.920 --> 3:35:33.920]  which is truly where we are heading.
[3:35:33.920 --> 3:35:35.920]  It's a miracle that we are not there now.
[3:35:35.920 --> 3:35:39.920]  The information here that you just gave, I want to touch on real quickly,
[3:35:39.920 --> 3:35:43.920]  has gotten the attention of the Rothschilds, has gotten me canceled off of Twitter,
[3:35:43.920 --> 3:35:45.920]  and has me under surveillance.
[3:35:45.920 --> 3:35:48.920]  We'll tell you why right after the break when we return with more from Ruby.
[3:35:48.920 --> 3:36:03.920]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[3:36:03.920 --> 3:36:14.920]  Infowars has been banned, arrested, attacked and threatened,
[3:36:14.920 --> 3:36:18.920]  because we are effective.
[3:36:18.920 --> 3:36:20.920]  The great awakening is here.
[3:36:20.920 --> 3:36:26.920]  Go to banned.video, download the videos and share.
[3:36:26.920 --> 3:36:33.920]  Support the information war at infowarstore.com
[3:36:33.920 --> 3:36:43.920]  and never give up the fight.
[3:36:43.920 --> 3:36:48.920]  Infowars.com
[3:37:21.920 --> 3:37:23.920]  I need your help more than ever now.
[3:37:23.920 --> 3:37:27.920]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[3:37:27.920 --> 3:37:32.920]  So pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can,

[3:37:38.920 --> 3:37:41.920]  Whether it's high quality coffee or supplements or books or films,
[3:37:41.920 --> 3:37:44.920]  all of it nurtures the soul, all of it empowers humanity,
[3:37:44.920 --> 3:37:47.920]  all of it is pro-human and pro-God.
[3:37:47.920 --> 3:37:50.920]  Thank you so much.
[3:37:50.920 --> 3:37:55.920]  The entire New World Order system is about making you feel pathetic,
[3:37:55.920 --> 3:37:59.920]  making you feel weak, making you play the part of a victim,
[3:37:59.920 --> 3:38:02.920]  so you don't take your birthright as being made the image of God
[3:38:02.920 --> 3:38:06.920]  and the incredible mission and destiny we have being given free will.
[3:38:06.920 --> 3:38:12.920]  Being given free will, being given consciousness is literally the seed of an entire universe,
[3:38:12.920 --> 3:38:14.920]  an entire system.
[3:38:14.920 --> 3:38:17.920]  And the fact that you're able to commune with God,
[3:38:17.920 --> 3:38:19.920]  the fact that you're able to see the beauty of the sunset
[3:38:19.920 --> 3:38:21.920]  or the beauty of the waves in the ocean
[3:38:21.920 --> 3:38:23.920]  or the beauty of your wife or your husband
[3:38:23.920 --> 3:38:27.920]  or the beauty of your child learning knowledge, the beauty of music.
[3:38:27.920 --> 3:38:31.920]  The fact that you can commune with that and resonate with that is energetic
[3:38:31.920 --> 3:38:35.920]  and that itself is what God teaches us is worship.
[3:38:35.920 --> 3:38:38.920]  So don't worship the globalist, don't worship the NFL,
[3:38:38.920 --> 3:38:40.920]  don't worship all the things of the system,
[3:38:40.920 --> 3:38:43.920]  but worship the things of God because we're made by God.
[3:38:43.920 --> 3:39:07.920]  And appreciate your consciousness and appreciate free speech while you still have it.

[3:39:55.920 --> 3:40:00.920]  Alex Jones Show.
[3:40:30.920 --> 3:40:33.920]  My name is Stu Peters. Please come and find me at stupeters.tv.
[3:40:33.920 --> 3:40:40.920]  We're joined by Dr. Jane Ruby, who has been one of the most brave experts in this field,
[3:40:40.920 --> 3:40:43.920]  20 years of pharmaceutical research experience.
[3:40:43.920 --> 3:40:45.920]  You can find her at drjaneruby.com.
[3:40:45.920 --> 3:40:49.920]  She has now kind of become a medical investigator.
[3:40:49.920 --> 3:40:51.920]  That's what's happening here.
[3:40:51.920 --> 3:40:54.920]  I mean, it's insane what's going on.
[3:40:54.920 --> 3:40:56.920]  So there's numbers that I mentioned.
[3:40:56.920 --> 3:40:59.920]  There's another system that's available, which we're going to get to in a minute,
[3:40:59.920 --> 3:41:01.920]  but I want to continue this deal on these pilots.
[3:41:01.920 --> 3:41:05.920]  This is, although the fact checkers say that it's false,
[3:41:05.920 --> 3:41:07.920]  that this is a horrific phenomenon.
[3:41:07.920 --> 3:41:12.920]  I don't know about you, but I hope that they have unvaxxed pilots sitting in coach,
[3:41:12.920 --> 3:41:17.920]  ready to fly these planes, ready to land them in the event that at 46,000 feet,
[3:41:17.920 --> 3:41:19.920]  these pilots are meeting their maker.
[3:41:19.920 --> 3:41:25.920]  Is it just by sheer luck or by the blessing of God that we have not seen this yet?
[3:41:25.920 --> 3:41:29.920]  Are these pilots a ticking time bomb?
[3:41:29.920 --> 3:41:36.920]  Well, the frightening thing is to me that while the airlines are putting out messaging,
[3:41:36.920 --> 3:41:42.920]  public messages to tell the flying public to avoid flying if they've received one of these injections,
[3:41:42.920 --> 3:41:47.920]  they're behind the scenes creating incentives and getting close to a deadline
[3:41:47.920 --> 3:41:53.920]  where they claim they're going to mandate 100% of the pilots, flight attendants,
[3:41:53.920 --> 3:42:00.920]  and the FAA, I guess, are going to get them involved with something about getting all the control tower people injected.
[3:42:00.920 --> 3:42:03.920]  So I don't understand how they reconcile that with themselves,
[3:42:03.920 --> 3:42:05.920]  but let me tell you a quick story, Stu.
[3:42:05.920 --> 3:42:12.920]  As you mentioned at the top of the hour, there are pilots that are coming out of the woodwork.
[3:42:12.920 --> 3:42:16.920]  They're trying to tell us their internal struggle and how bad it is.
[3:42:16.920 --> 3:42:18.920]  There's one in particular that reached out to me.
[3:42:18.920 --> 3:42:23.920]  I'm going to actually be connecting him with you because hopefully he'll be on your show,
[3:42:23.920 --> 3:42:27.920]  and he can tell more of the story, but basically what he's doing is he's trying to buy time.
[3:42:27.920 --> 3:42:29.920]  He's trying to avoid getting one of these shots.
[3:42:29.920 --> 3:42:37.920]  And he wrote to his leadership, the Union, by the way, is in total lockstep with every company.
[3:42:37.920 --> 3:42:46.920]  The airline pilots association of America is actually supposed to be representing these pilots.
[3:42:46.920 --> 3:42:49.920]  They are in lockstep with all of the American carriers.
[3:42:49.920 --> 3:42:53.920]  And this particular pilot said that he pleaded with his leadership and said,
[3:42:53.920 --> 3:42:55.920]  look, this is not my choice.
[3:42:55.920 --> 3:42:56.920]  There are too many risks.
[3:42:56.920 --> 3:42:57.920]  This is experimental.
[3:42:57.920 --> 3:43:05.920]  And because it's experimental, it goes against the Nuremberg codes that came out of the trials.
[3:43:05.920 --> 3:43:08.920]  And he got such backlash.
[3:43:08.920 --> 3:43:10.920]  He was called an anti-Semite.
[3:43:10.920 --> 3:43:13.920]  How dare he bring in the Nuremberg trials?
[3:43:13.920 --> 3:43:19.920]  Is it the only people that were injured in the Nuremberg trials were Jews?
[3:43:19.920 --> 3:43:24.920]  And his leadership said, I'm going to share some of this.
[3:43:24.920 --> 3:43:26.920]  The leadership wrote back and snapped and said,
[3:43:26.920 --> 3:43:32.920]  I stand with the rest of the Jewish members of our group here, our Union group,
[3:43:32.920 --> 3:43:34.920]  in taking offense to your comparison.
[3:43:34.920 --> 3:43:38.920]  And so the pilot wrote back and said, one of the other reps wrote back and said,
[3:43:38.920 --> 3:43:43.920]  look, the Nuremberg code is about that medical experiments should be voluntary.
[3:43:43.920 --> 3:43:45.920]  And here's what he wrote back to.
[3:43:45.920 --> 3:43:51.920]  And this is going to give you all an idea of what pilots and flight attendants are struggling with behind the scenes right now.
[3:43:51.920 --> 3:43:57.920]  This leader, who is a chairman, this is, I was given permission to use his name from this email.
[3:43:57.920 --> 3:44:03.920]  Captain Todd Insler is a chairman for the Union, for one of the airlines.
[3:44:03.920 --> 3:44:10.920]  And he said, please let this pilot know it's wholly inappropriate to compare Nuremberg to voluntary COVID vaccinations.
[3:44:10.920 --> 3:44:11.920]  What?
[3:44:11.920 --> 3:44:20.920]  When we round them up, seize their belongings and put them in trains to work camps and tattoo them with ID numbers and shave their heads,
[3:44:20.920 --> 3:44:23.920]  make them wear prison clothes, then he can bring up Nuremberg.
[3:44:23.920 --> 3:44:25.920]  And here's how he closes stew.
[3:44:25.920 --> 3:44:34.920]  Until then, he can go get a effing shot and collect $4,000 or he can STFU.
[3:44:34.920 --> 3:44:39.920]  His comments are more than offensive.
[3:44:39.920 --> 3:44:40.920]  I don't know what to say.
[3:44:40.920 --> 3:44:46.920]  We're being told that pilots are not being mandated to take this job.
[3:44:46.920 --> 3:44:48.920]  They are out and out lying.
[3:44:48.920 --> 3:44:50.920]  We know that.
[3:44:50.920 --> 3:44:56.920]  I have inside information from a Delta flight attendant who differentiated flight attendants from pilots.
[3:44:56.920 --> 3:44:59.920]  The reason being is because pilots are part of the Union.
[3:44:59.920 --> 3:45:04.920]  At this point in time, the flight attendants are not a part of the Union.
[3:45:04.920 --> 3:45:08.920]  That flight attendant can unequivocally provide documentation and will.
[3:45:08.920 --> 3:45:09.920]  It's been received in my email.
[3:45:09.920 --> 3:45:14.920]  I have to redact some of this stuff, but I can tell you 100% that I have seen it.
[3:45:14.920 --> 3:45:20.920]  I've seen proof that Delta Airlines is force vaccinating all of their pilots.
[3:45:20.920 --> 3:45:22.920]  If you don't take it, you're out of here.
[3:45:22.920 --> 3:45:24.920]  I want to point something out.
[3:45:24.920 --> 3:45:33.920]  The producers just put up a great picture of an article where the airlines are telling their pilots not to fly for two weeks after the jab.
[3:45:33.920 --> 3:45:37.920]  I'd like to respectfully ask upon what science is that based?
[3:45:37.920 --> 3:45:39.920]  How do you know it's two weeks?
[3:45:39.920 --> 3:45:40.920]  How do you know it's four weeks?
[3:45:40.920 --> 3:45:42.920]  How do you know it should be anything at all?
[3:45:42.920 --> 3:45:44.920]  I'd like to know what that's based on.
[3:45:44.920 --> 3:45:49.920]  This stuff just gets plucked out of the air, Stu, and all of a sudden there's a policy based on it.
[3:45:49.920 --> 3:45:51.920]  This is very dangerous.
[3:45:51.920 --> 3:45:54.920]  We have our children, our flying public on airplanes.
[3:45:54.920 --> 3:45:56.920]  It's got to be investigated.
[3:45:56.920 --> 3:45:59.920]  And yes, why isn't Pfizer having a press conference?
[3:45:59.920 --> 3:46:02.920]  Why isn't United Airlines having a press conference?
[3:46:02.920 --> 3:46:03.920]  Why isn't American?
[3:46:03.920 --> 3:46:09.920]  I don't know, Stu, maybe because they feel like they've got enough cover and they don't have to defend themselves publicly.
[3:46:09.920 --> 3:46:14.920]  Well, what I will say is that the information that we're bringing to light is right out in the wide open.
[3:46:14.920 --> 3:46:26.920]  The graphene flagship, if you want to look these people up, the graphene flagship, I'm going to say it again, these people at the graphene flagship need to be investigated.
[3:46:26.920 --> 3:46:36.920]  Now, these are the very people that are telling you that graphene, graphene oxide, can play a role in helping to calm your anxiety.
[3:46:36.920 --> 3:46:46.920]  Now, at the same time that is happening, that that is being released, we here in America, those that are being subjected to the fear-mongering of the mainstream media,
[3:46:46.920 --> 3:46:48.920]  we're seeing these people with masks on.
[3:46:48.920 --> 3:46:53.920]  We're seeing people in scrubs and in lab coats telling you, you have to go get this thing.
[3:46:53.920 --> 3:46:59.920]  Your research can no longer be, obviously, we have come to the conclusion asking your doctor because your doctor has no idea.
[3:46:59.920 --> 3:47:08.920]  To your point, why aren't they having a press conference, how are they coming up with this timeline for the airlines, this timeline for the pilots, two weeks, and these are arbitrary numbers, they don't know.
[3:47:08.920 --> 3:47:10.920]  The fact is, nobody knows.
[3:47:10.920 --> 3:47:12.920]  Nobody in a lab coat knows.
[3:47:12.920 --> 3:47:18.920]  None of the pharmacists that are injecting this stuff knows and they don't know because as we have previously talked about, the leaflets are blank in these things.
[3:47:18.920 --> 3:47:20.920]  The inserts are blank.
[3:47:20.920 --> 3:47:26.920]  100% no info intentionally left blank are the only words that are on the inside of these things.
[3:47:26.920 --> 3:47:31.920]  We have proven the theory of this magnetism just by virtue.
[3:47:31.920 --> 3:47:33.920]  People sticking magnetic stuff to them.
[3:47:33.920 --> 3:47:36.920]  Metal objects are not supposed to stick to human beings.
[3:47:36.920 --> 3:47:38.920]  It doesn't matter what a fact checker says.
[3:47:38.920 --> 3:47:42.920]  Metal objects are not supposed to stick to poultry, fish, or meat.
[3:47:42.920 --> 3:47:44.920]  You will no longer be eating real meat.
[3:47:44.920 --> 3:47:48.920]  This is all a part of the plan to scare you away from beef.
[3:47:48.920 --> 3:47:55.920]  It's not a coincidence that this is coming out at the same time that they're trying to push this Green New Deal, which by the way would get rid of your cows.
[3:47:55.920 --> 3:48:02.920]  It's not a coincidence that while they're talking about trillions of dollars in infrastructure bills that they're trying to ram down the throat of the taxpayer.
[3:48:02.920 --> 3:48:07.920]  And whether you like it or not, they're going to do it because they've already proven that your vote doesn't count, your voice doesn't matter.
[3:48:07.920 --> 3:48:12.920]  And while they're talking about this infrastructure thing, buildings are falling.
[3:48:12.920 --> 3:48:14.920]  Bridges are failing.
[3:48:14.920 --> 3:48:17.920]  And this is all happening surprisingly at one time.
[3:48:17.920 --> 3:48:23.920]  At the very same time that they're talking about a gun control problem and gun violence is breaking out all over America.
[3:48:23.920 --> 3:48:30.920]  It's the same exact time that you see the defunding of police departments and a mass exodus of good cops that are there to take care of you and me.
[3:48:30.920 --> 3:48:35.920]  At the same time that they're talking about all of this, it's all happening at one time.
[3:48:35.920 --> 3:48:38.920]  Joe Biden is a Trojan horse.
[3:48:38.920 --> 3:48:43.920]  Joe Biden will sign absolutely anything that they put in front of him.
[3:48:43.920 --> 3:48:50.920]  And the reason that they will do that is so that by virtue, Kamala Harris looks like the voice of moderation.
[3:48:50.920 --> 3:49:01.920]  Imagine that. Imagine the most cynical, the most extremist radical senator that has ever occupied a seat in that building.
[3:49:01.920 --> 3:49:12.920]  Her name is Kamala Harris, who is now supposedly, allegedly the vice president, is looming over Joe Biden, waiting for that gun legislation to get passed.
[3:49:12.920 --> 3:49:21.920]  Very strict gun legislation that will either take your guns from you or will significantly restrict who can buy them, what your magazine capacity is, what type of gun you can own,
[3:49:21.920 --> 3:49:26.920]  thereby pretty much eliminating any self defense that you would have whatsoever.
[3:49:26.920 --> 3:49:36.920]  When that passes, it is my prediction that that is when she will force him out or he will bow out due to some medical issues, some unforeseen medical issue.
[3:49:36.920 --> 3:49:46.920]  And then this person, this, the most radical senator that you have ever known in the history of our country will look like a voice of moderation.
[3:49:46.920 --> 3:49:48.920]  None of this is by accident.
[3:49:48.920 --> 3:49:54.920]  Dr. Ruby, thank you so much for being here. I can't tell you how much we appreciate your insight and please continue to follow up on this.
[3:49:54.920 --> 3:50:00.920]  If you want to reach Dr. Jane Ruby, you can hit her up in her secure and encrypted email, Dr. Jane Ruby at protonmail.com.
[3:50:00.920 --> 3:50:02.920]  Thanks again. We really appreciate it.
[3:50:02.920 --> 3:50:16.920]  Back here next week, I'm going to have redacted evidence from whistleblowers, not only inside of these airlines, flight attendants, pilots, testimony on the record, recorded military personnel.
[3:50:16.920 --> 3:50:25.920]  Last night, I received a phone call from a person inside of active duty military who has security clearances, knows what the plan is there.
[3:50:25.920 --> 3:50:29.920]  We're not ready to go with it, but I'm telling you, it looks absolutely horrific.
[3:50:29.920 --> 3:50:36.920]  Stay blessed in your faith. Stay strong with God. Unite with one another. Please have a great Independence Day weekend.
[3:50:36.920 --> 3:51:00.920]  My name is Stu Peters.
