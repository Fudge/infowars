[00:00.000 --> 00:12.100]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.100 --> 00:31.700]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:31.700 --> 00:36.340]  well ladies and gentlemen I've watched all the Republican presidential debates
[00:36.340 --> 00:41.740]  this year I've covered them live on the air with the crew but last night was
[00:41.740 --> 00:47.660]  undoubtedly the most revealing it was not one of these canned mindless debates
[00:47.660 --> 00:53.500]  we've seen the last few election cycles a lot of key stuff came out the fact that
[00:53.500 --> 00:57.640]  a lot of Republican neocons want World War three and are completely unstable and
[00:57.640 --> 01:02.620]  insane I mean even Hitler and Stalin didn't talk about launching giant wars
[01:02.620 --> 01:06.540]  publicly they just did it they didn't talk about giving other countries bloody
[01:06.540 --> 01:13.420]  noses or blowing up superpowers aircraft and just bizarre behavior and
[01:13.420 --> 01:18.340]  Rand Paul really shined in my view last night I thought he did a great job
[01:18.340 --> 01:23.820]  overall I thought he spent too much time attacking Donald Trump which is a not a
[01:23.820 --> 01:27.620]  good move for him obviously with the electorate but overall he brought up a
[01:27.620 --> 01:30.980]  lot of really good points was very aggressive defended internet freedom
[01:30.980 --> 01:35.660]  talked about how well if you want World War three elect Governor Kasich or
[01:35.660 --> 01:40.860]  elect Governor Christie really powerful information came out yesterday we've
[01:40.860 --> 01:45.100]  got a bunch of clips we're going to be airing today and we have several really
[01:45.100 --> 01:50.500]  informative guests joining us James O'Keefe will join us for about 45 minutes
[01:50.500 --> 01:54.420]  of the next hour on huge developments investigating the Democratic Party and
[01:54.420 --> 01:59.220]  their ongoing criminal mafia organized crime racketeering operations around
[01:59.220 --> 02:06.340]  the country literally mr. Dent Harry Dent will be in studio with us today he's
[02:06.340 --> 02:10.020]  here at a conference in Austin Texas he's gonna be in studio with us on the
[02:10.020 --> 02:15.500]  Fed rate hike they say is coming of the economy and more with all his charts and
[02:15.500 --> 02:19.380]  the demographic cliff and the rest of it and David Knight will be hosting the
[02:19.380 --> 02:24.100]  fourth hour with even more of the highlights of the debate last night as
[02:24.100 --> 02:29.940]  well that said we've got the house dims push assault weapons ban which they
[02:29.940 --> 02:36.900]  swore they wouldn't do two suspects of Paris linked attacks arrested in a
[02:36.900 --> 02:43.300]  Austrian refugee center Dutch Museum renaming art for cultural sensitivity
[02:43.300 --> 02:49.300]  and of course German court let's off Sharia police patrol in a major German
[02:49.300 --> 02:55.180]  city these these these Sharia groups are on record in the US England and Germany
[02:55.180 --> 02:59.300]  and Sweden going around bossing people around it's in the news and they have
[02:59.300 --> 03:05.980]  all these world leaders like Merkel and Hollande and the mayor of London that we
[03:05.980 --> 03:09.300]  have that clip and we're plenty yesterday saying that none of this is
[03:09.300 --> 03:13.300]  happening and of course but those weren't terror attacks two weeks ago in
[03:13.300 --> 03:18.460]  San Bernardino and London wasn't a terror attack the last attack and Paris
[03:18.460 --> 03:23.020]  wasn't a terror attack and don't show women wearing burkas on TV even though
[03:23.020 --> 03:27.580]  that's how they dress themselves when they machine gun people or had jib had
[03:27.580 --> 03:32.500]  jobs whatever you want to call it I mean it's just ridiculous so that's all
[03:32.500 --> 03:37.300]  coming up big world news big US news politics news science news economy news
[03:37.300 --> 03:42.620]  it's massive but the big story on info wars calm Trump exposes the Bush
[03:42.620 --> 03:48.820]  family's complicity in helping them in London's escape on 9-11 while all other
[03:48.820 --> 03:52.460]  air traffic was shut down we'll go out to break with a one-minute clip from my
[03:52.460 --> 03:56.420]  live coverage of this last night here it is I mean this is why Trump is so
[03:56.420 --> 04:00.100]  awesome I mean he really is awake to the new order supposedly behind the scenes
[04:00.100 --> 04:03.060]  I'll just say that with that inside baseball that's what I mean who else
[04:03.060 --> 04:07.100]  would come back like that at the bushes and the Clintons calling them criminals
[04:07.100 --> 04:10.420]  and the fight as you guys go back to your live feeds we've got to go back on the
[04:10.420 --> 04:13.940]  DVR grab that play that clip again that is sensational that's what we should
[04:13.940 --> 04:17.460]  write about is that Trump brings out the fact that the bushes protected them in
[04:17.460 --> 04:22.220]  lines they wanted to go after him saying you know you want to go after the
[04:22.220 --> 04:26.380]  families of these ISIS members and he's absolutely right well will you should we
[04:26.380 --> 04:29.780]  protect him like the book like your brother did well I mean I mean getting
[04:29.780 --> 04:32.620]  past arresting people's family members are going after him or whatever and I'm
[04:32.620 --> 04:36.020]  not even endorsing that it's the Trump will come back with hardcore 9-11 truth
[04:36.020 --> 04:40.500]  yeah exactly all other aircraft are grounded everything else is shut down for two days
[04:40.500 --> 04:43.820]  the bin Laden's are flying around getting out of the country when you had the
[04:43.820 --> 04:48.540]  world trade said to go people were put into planes that were friends family
[04:48.540 --> 04:52.500]  girlfriends and they were put into planes and they were sent back for the
[04:52.500 --> 04:59.660]  most part to Saudi Arabia they knew what was going on Hillary Clinton wants to
[04:59.660 --> 05:02.860]  censor people who make fun of her she was recently trying to censor comedy
[05:02.860 --> 05:06.060]  skits that poked fun at her which were produced by the Laugh Factory in Los

[08:39.100 --> 08:45.820]  veritas the truth project with big breaking news analysis joining us for
[08:45.820 --> 08:50.300]  part of the second hour we'll also open phones today a lot of clips throughout
[08:50.300 --> 08:55.500]  the broadcast from what I think was the most powerful Republican debate yet and
[08:55.500 --> 09:03.140]  the one back two before this at CNBC was totally dynamite because all the
[09:03.140 --> 09:07.900]  candidates unloaded on the control press and their deceptive twisted
[09:07.900 --> 09:14.260]  questions meant to derail any attempt by the Republican Party or the American
[09:14.260 --> 09:19.380]  people to defeat Hillary Clinton it was a true routing of them they were like
[09:19.380 --> 09:26.220]  beaten wet dogs reportedly after the debate because no one groveled to their
[09:26.220 --> 09:31.820]  hoax no one groveled to the media putting on its front and watching on CNN
[09:31.820 --> 09:36.220]  last night in the buildup in the hours before at Anderson Cooper the CIA
[09:36.220 --> 09:41.220]  officer leading all the other little stuff shirts up there both male and
[09:41.220 --> 09:46.660]  female he was excited he was narcissistic he was rocking back and forth in
[09:46.660 --> 09:52.260]  his seat he had his best tie on he had his best suit on why they actually had
[09:52.260 --> 09:57.460]  audience of tens of millions last night his normal audience isn't even a half
[09:57.460 --> 10:02.140]  million during prime time it's only when there's a mass shooting or an earthquake
[10:02.140 --> 10:08.700]  that a few people tune in gone are the days of 10 20 30 million viewers of CNN
[10:08.700 --> 10:17.700]  they're down to 500,000 on their biggest shows same thing for MSNBC so they got
[10:17.700 --> 10:20.740]  to do the attack dogging on CNBC now because it still has a little bit of an
[10:20.740 --> 10:25.500]  audience oh but people don't buy into that so their ratings go down they have
[10:25.500 --> 10:29.140]  flatlined and when they have a big debate like this because there's so much
[10:29.140 --> 10:33.380]  interest they have a dead cat balance as many as 40 million people
[10:33.380 --> 10:35.940]  let's get the latest numbers I didn't look that up this morning I know some of
[10:35.940 --> 10:39.580]  the other debates have had 45 50 million people tune in this one was later to
[10:39.580 --> 10:42.980]  have even more that was a number I didn't look up can we look up the Nielsen's
[10:42.980 --> 10:49.460]  on this where Nielsen's been caught fluffing and pumping up the ratings for
[10:49.460 --> 10:54.980]  CNN and MSNBC but I mean you've got to Republican primary debate was likely
[10:54.980 --> 11:00.980]  third most watched ever according to CNN if you scroll down they might give us
[11:00.980 --> 11:06.260]  the actual number drumroll please
[11:07.420 --> 11:16.260]  CNBC 14 million Fox Business average 13.5 million Fox News average 25 million
[11:16.260 --> 11:24.780]  viewers and CNN is estimating drumroll 15.3 million in their October
[11:24.780 --> 11:30.740]  debate so there you have it I don't think they even say oh they haven't
[11:30.740 --> 11:35.140]  released it yet there you go no wonder I don't know so I guess they've got to
[11:35.140 --> 11:39.120]  figure that out off all the DVRs because that's where they get it from now they
[11:39.120 --> 11:43.540]  know exactly roughly how many households how many people watch the point is a lot
[11:43.540 --> 11:51.860]  of people watch 20 million 30 million this is a big audience for them this is
[11:51.860 --> 11:57.340]  the only time they get to imagine that they're still dominant are these rare
[11:57.340 --> 12:01.740]  events like blue moons but it is on these blue moons they can still ram a
[12:01.740 --> 12:08.740]  hoax through you had the deranged drugged out lunatic kill nine innocent
[12:08.740 --> 12:12.780]  black people in cold blood reportedly so much stuff is staged who knows but
[12:12.780 --> 12:19.460]  let's just say it's true it's outrageous it's horrible and the media got states
[12:19.460 --> 12:24.220]  to remove the rebel flag collectively they blame gun owners they it was white
[12:24.220 --> 12:27.900]  people's fault wasn't white people's fault any more than than the deranged
[12:27.900 --> 12:33.340]  loon who went and shot the camera people in the in the reporter it's not black
[12:33.340 --> 12:38.340]  people's fault that some crazy black person did that it's not my fault of
[12:38.340 --> 12:42.420]  Jeffrey Dahmer's white he goes out and grabs black kids white kids Hispanic
[12:42.420 --> 12:46.260]  kids off the street and rapes them and eats them he's a psychopathic killer
[12:46.260 --> 12:51.460]  it's not my fault he tortured animals when he was a kid it's not my fault it's
[12:51.460 --> 12:55.660]  not my fault when a white person does something it's not black people's fault
[12:55.660 --> 13:01.380]  that idiom mean eight prisoners by the way it came on congressional testimony
[13:01.380 --> 13:07.060]  about ISIS eating people by the way they do that on video they roast people they
[13:07.060 --> 13:12.100]  eat their hearts they eat their eyeballs to terrorize and now it's come out that
[13:12.100 --> 13:17.660]  they roast the young girls they rape and then murder and then they roast them so
[13:17.660 --> 13:20.980]  we're gonna be getting into the roasting that the mainstream media makes fun of
[13:20.980 --> 13:25.300]  oh nobody makes women wear a headdress in the Middle East no one restricts free
[13:25.300 --> 13:28.660]  speech there's no stinger missiles there's no dough missiles there's no
[13:28.660 --> 13:31.780]  terrorist in amongst the
[13:34.180 --> 13:41.300]  refugees so that's what's coming up today now before I go any further let's
[13:41.300 --> 13:44.220]  just read over some of the headlines that are at info wars com with the
[13:44.220 --> 13:48.900]  video clips that are just bombshell trump exposed how bush family helped
[13:48.900 --> 13:53.780]  bin laden's escape at her 9-11 bombshell while air traffic was shut down
[13:53.780 --> 13:57.900]  across the United States for two days the president allowed the bin laden's to
[13:57.900 --> 14:06.140]  be flown out of the country to safety on more than 15 flights now I've covered
[14:06.140 --> 14:10.140]  this from the day it happened it was in the Miami Herald and other papers they
[14:10.140 --> 14:16.140]  would actually have people get on TV back in 2001 2002 2003 and they would say
[14:16.140 --> 14:21.020]  that I was a liar and this was a conspiracy theory hoping you wouldn't go
[14:21.020 --> 14:29.100]  look up NBC news ABC news CBS news Fox news the Miami newspapers I mean it was
[14:29.100 --> 14:34.220]  in five or six big papers McClatchy covered it out of Florida it was on all
[14:34.220 --> 14:38.340]  the TV stations because people were there protesting as they were getting on
[14:38.340 --> 14:43.740]  their jets this was an evacuation of the bin laden's but the bushes were having
[14:43.740 --> 14:54.980]  dinner with the morning breakfast with at the arms summit at their table at the
[14:54.980 --> 14:58.420]  carlall group on the morning of 9-11 and they had dinner with them two days
[14:58.420 --> 15:02.420]  before that's why I conflate those two and we're talking about the folks
[15:02.420 --> 15:06.260]  directly involved in all this the bin laden's were given multi-billion dollar
[15:06.260 --> 15:10.420]  US contracts in the Middle East to build military bases and put in air
[15:10.420 --> 15:19.940]  conditioning the day after 9-11 so the point is is that Trump is planning to
[15:19.940 --> 15:27.500]  use 9-11 truth on Jebi and I told you that and I've told you that before
[15:27.500 --> 15:31.260]  Trump did it and I've told you that after Trump did it because I've been told
[15:31.260 --> 15:36.260]  by little birdies that this is the case and let me tell you something I went
[15:36.260 --> 15:39.860]  from really liking Trump to really knowing he's for real last night in my
[15:39.860 --> 15:46.180]  gut not perfect a loose cannon in some respects but but actually isn't actively
[15:46.180 --> 15:49.260]  evil against this country which is a big difference from Jeb Bush and Hillary who
[15:49.260 --> 15:55.660]  are true agents of evil whenever in fact I want to find this clip it's in their
[15:55.660 --> 16:04.100]  whole exchange whenever Jeb Bush looks at him and says you will never be
[16:04.100 --> 16:08.340]  president and he cuts out a little friendly boy hey kids get in my white
[16:08.340 --> 16:13.900]  van I got candy oh hi I'm the friendly little old man oh people hate that
[16:13.900 --> 16:18.980]  goofiness because they know it's fake he cut out of that and he goes listen you
[16:18.980 --> 16:22.540]  probably find the clip typing in Jeb Bush tells Trump he will never be
[16:22.540 --> 16:27.540]  president he goes you will never be president and that's because they own
[16:27.540 --> 16:31.260]  the fraudulent delegates and his people are bragging we don't care if we have
[16:31.260 --> 16:34.660]  one percent of the vote he will get the nomination in the broker convention they
[16:34.660 --> 16:40.140]  are bragging about this that's the elitism of these people let's go ahead
[16:40.140 --> 16:43.420]  and go to the exchange though between the two where they bring up the fact that
[16:43.420 --> 16:47.420]  Trump said he'd go after terrorist families here it is
[16:47.420 --> 16:51.860]  Jacob from Georgia Tech recently Donald Trump mentioned that we must kill the
[16:51.860 --> 16:55.460]  families of ISIS members however this violates the principle of distinction
[16:55.460 --> 16:59.420]  between civilians and combatants in international law so my question is how
[16:59.420 --> 17:03.780]  would intentionally killing innocent civilians set us apart from ISIS Mr.
[17:03.780 --> 17:09.060]  Trump we have to be much tougher we have to be much stronger than we've been we
[17:09.060 --> 17:12.380]  have people that know what's going on you take a look at just the attack in
[17:12.380 --> 17:15.340]  California the other day there were numerous people including the mother
[17:15.340 --> 17:18.980]  that knew what was going on they saw a pipe bomb sitting all over the floor
[17:18.980 --> 17:23.380]  they saw ammunition all over the place they knew exactly what was going on when
[17:23.380 --> 17:27.820]  you had the world trade said to go people were put into planes that were
[17:27.820 --> 17:32.180]  friends family girlfriends and they were put into planes and they were said
[17:32.180 --> 17:36.300]  back for the most part to Saudi Arabia they knew what was going on they went
[17:36.300 --> 17:40.380]  home and they wanted to watch their boyfriends on television I would be very
[17:40.380 --> 17:45.180]  very firm with families and frankly that will make people think because they
[17:45.180 --> 17:49.500]  may not care much about their lives but they do care believe it or not about
[17:49.500 --> 17:57.660]  their family's lives this is another example of the lack of seriousness look
[17:57.660 --> 18:06.340]  this is this is troubling because we're at war they've declared war on us the
[18:06.340 --> 18:11.180]  idea that that is a solution to this is just it's just crazy it makes no sense
[18:11.180 --> 18:16.540]  to suggest this look two months ago Donald Trump said that Isis was not our
[18:16.540 --> 18:21.340]  fight just two months ago he said that Hillary Clinton never a great negotiator
[18:21.340 --> 18:25.860]  total line with Iran and he got gets his foreign policy experience from the
[18:25.860 --> 18:31.180]  shows coming that is not a serious kind of candidate we need someone that thinks
[18:31.180 --> 18:39.820]  this through that can lead our country to safety and security mr. Trump
[18:39.820 --> 18:45.180]  we need toughness honestly I think Jeb is a very nice person he's a very nice
[18:45.180 --> 18:49.100]  person but we need tough people we need toughness we need intelligence and we
[18:49.100 --> 18:52.900]  need tough Jeb said when they come across the southern border they come as an
[18:52.900 --> 18:57.460]  active love you said in September 30th that Isis was not am I talking are you
[18:57.460 --> 19:00.700]  talking Jeb I'm talking right now I'm talking you can go back you're not
[19:00.700 --> 19:06.140]  talking you interrupted September 30 you apologize Jeb no am I allowed to finish
[19:06.140 --> 19:19.900]  one at a time am I allowed to finish go ahead mr. Trump so we need we need
[19:19.900 --> 19:27.380]  hard core we don't have that level of respect that we need and if we don't
[19:27.380 --> 19:31.900]  get it on the eyes boy just gonna go weaker weaker and just to say criminal
[19:31.900 --> 19:36.100]  we can't allow that jeb bush good god I'm leaving the country gets elected I
[19:36.100 --> 19:40.060]  really will I think I'm a talks about I think that's I just I was witness to it
[19:40.060 --> 19:43.860]  and so was everyone else and I was standing there they come across as an
[19:43.860 --> 19:48.220]  active love he's saying the same thing right now with radicalism basically
[19:48.220 --> 19:51.980]  entire nazi wealth it was put into South America won't work they run the
[19:51.980 --> 19:55.980]  nazi wealth I can't believe Donald you're not gonna be able to insult your way to
[19:55.980 --> 20:05.300]  the presidency that's not gonna happen and I do leadership leadership is not
[20:05.300 --> 20:10.740]  leadership is not about attacking people and disparaging people leadership is
[20:10.740 --> 20:15.300]  about creating a serious strategy to deal with the threat of our time and I
[20:15.300 --> 20:20.100]  laid out that strategy before the attacks in Paris and before the attacks in
[20:20.100 --> 20:24.500]  San Bernardino and it is the way that the way forward we need to increase our
[20:24.500 --> 20:29.220]  military spending we need to deal with a no-fly zone in Syria a safe zone we need
[20:29.220 --> 20:34.460]  to focus on building a military down so that we can destroy Islamic terror with
[20:34.460 --> 20:38.340]  jeb's attitude we will never be great again that I can tell you we will never
[20:38.340 --> 20:43.300]  be loved now I like how Trump has moderated his statement of go after
[20:43.300 --> 20:49.580]  their families kill them it is true that that is the one tactic proven to work
[20:49.580 --> 20:53.700]  on Al Qaeda is they say we got your 10-year-old son and we're gonna start
[20:53.700 --> 20:57.500]  torturing him if you don't give us all the info Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and
[20:57.500 --> 21:01.260]  others spilt their guts at that point and confessed to bombing buildings that
[21:01.260 --> 21:06.500]  were built after they were in prison they waterboarded him hundreds of times
[21:06.500 --> 21:13.420]  was it 200 plus one from memory they said we're gonna torch you son now we're
[21:13.420 --> 21:16.180]  gonna do it and we're gonna videotape it he said okay I'll just say whatever you
[21:16.180 --> 21:20.180]  want that's the problem though you get fake confessions with that and if you
[21:20.180 --> 21:22.780]  don't fund the terrorists to begin with you don't have to then go fight them
[21:22.780 --> 21:26.380]  later but see that's your excuse to get into Afghanistan and control the
[21:26.380 --> 21:31.300]  trillions in the last decade of opium it went from six percent of world
[21:31.300 --> 21:36.420]  production to 93% within two years oh we really liberated Afghanistan folks
[21:36.420 --> 21:41.540]  totally staged but see Trump is no learning process here it is true that
[21:41.540 --> 21:49.020]  of you prosecute the families who obviously know the dad of this guy said
[21:49.020 --> 21:53.660]  my son had pledged allegiance to ISIS let me tell you if my son pledged
[21:53.660 --> 21:59.300]  allegiance to ISIS hypothetically and I couldn't stop it and he was really
[21:59.300 --> 22:02.020]  saying that I would have to reporting because I don't want him getting killed
[22:02.020 --> 22:07.380]  in something of course he wouldn't I'd probably do something else I'm not gonna
[22:07.380 --> 22:12.100]  say it but the point is is that you know you know people are building pipe bombs
[22:12.100 --> 22:15.460]  you know they're about to pull a jihad and the whole family is coming around the
[22:15.460 --> 22:22.020]  house and you don't do anything about it that's called aiding and abetting is
[22:22.020 --> 22:26.060]  what that's called and I totally agree you got to prosecute people's families
[22:26.060 --> 22:30.540]  give the evidence shows they knew about it so people think twice because believe
[22:30.540 --> 22:33.700]  me if they knew mommy and daddy we're gonna get locked up for life sentences
[22:33.700 --> 22:38.020]  for aiding and abetting an act of terrorism and murder and mayhem they
[22:38.020 --> 22:42.820]  won't do it 99% of the time but these people love to think of themselves as
[22:42.820 --> 22:46.060]  heroes they don't like their lives they're mad at the good-looking women at
[22:46.060 --> 22:50.020]  the office mad she's got to wear the headdress at a subconscious level but
[22:50.020 --> 22:54.140]  can't bring her conditioning she's all crazed cuz I mean you know she's not
[22:54.140 --> 22:57.940]  the prettiest lady around seen some beautiful Arabic women but this lady
[22:57.940 --> 23:01.660]  ain't it she looks like a 60 year old you know fat Arabic man or something I
[23:01.660 --> 23:05.180]  mean you know I'm sorry she's ugly she looks like the Loch Ness monster she
[23:05.180 --> 23:11.460]  wants to go kill all the hot chicks at work what happened and now I know I got
[23:11.460 --> 23:15.180]  to get my guns up cuz some freaks you brought in this country want to go around
[23:15.180 --> 23:22.580]  shooting people no no no go stay in your third world hellhole be chained up get

[23:35.780 --> 23:39.180]  spoiled rotten women in this country that think the liberals and the media and
[23:39.180 --> 23:43.500]  the CIA and the social engineers your friends they hate your stinking guts
[23:43.500 --> 23:48.660]  women they want you working 70 hours a week with no pension no future no kids
[23:48.660 --> 23:55.700]  no husband pump full of sterile and thinking you're free and the very same
[23:55.700 --> 24:01.140]  scum selling you this whole agenda Miss magazine run by the CIA declassified
[24:01.140 --> 24:05.540]  did it to make sure you were all along they're the same ones that want to put
[24:05.540 --> 24:10.100]  you under this type of garbage and defend women not be able to drive cars
[24:10.100 --> 24:14.420]  and wearing hoods over their heads I'm sorry Richard you just popped in my
[24:14.420 --> 24:16.980]  ear excuse me
[24:17.060 --> 24:21.540]  yo yes thank you he has the in fact just pop on there whenever you want bro most
[24:21.540 --> 24:24.980]  the time if you got a clip for folks you can just come on here let me ask you
[24:24.980 --> 24:28.940]  Richard last night covering the debate working on the debate being up here
[24:28.940 --> 24:33.180]  doing it you'll put in great 14 hours yesterday the whole crew here at m4's
[24:33.180 --> 24:36.340]  news center what did you think because this is unscripted I don't know what
[24:36.340 --> 24:38.780]  you think of the debates what you think of the debates and we have the clip of
[24:38.780 --> 24:42.300]  Jeb saying you will never be president that was a direct threat where he shows
[24:42.300 --> 24:49.140]  the real bush look of crazed hardcore original gangsters you talk about James
[24:49.140 --> 24:54.180]  Bond villain Superman villains baby they're it that whole milk toast they
[24:54.180 --> 24:59.300]  like to eat hamburgers and play golf and watch football games and eat their
[24:59.300 --> 25:03.740]  boogers on TV you know most of them get caught doing that these people are
[25:03.740 --> 25:10.940]  absolute total evil they are the Democrats answer to the Republican Party
[25:10.940 --> 25:14.980]  they are Rockefeller Republicans Democrats in the 60s that couldn't take
[25:14.980 --> 25:20.940]  over and so they infiltrated the Republican Party and John Boehner and all
[25:20.940 --> 25:24.540]  the rest of them are enemies of this country and of course Boehner's gone
[25:24.540 --> 25:29.580]  now but I bring that up because these are the scum this is why we can't get
[25:29.580 --> 25:33.420]  change this is why we can't cut taxes this is why we can't turn our coal
[25:33.420 --> 25:37.180]  power plants back on I obsess on that folks as our energy prices have basically
[25:37.180 --> 25:41.740]  doubled for electricity the last seven years that has crippled us no one will
[25:41.740 --> 25:46.180]  build factories here because you cannot compete with India and China and Mexico
[25:46.180 --> 25:51.340]  and 160 plus other countries and I'm not against India and China and Mexico but
[25:51.340 --> 25:55.220]  you know what we're gonna have power plants too we're gonna have cheap
[25:55.220 --> 25:59.260]  energy we're gonna have a level playing field when we take this country back do
[25:59.260 --> 26:04.460]  you understand that get it through your hands you call me a terrorist a right
[26:04.460 --> 26:08.620]  winger because I don't want to screw our country over I'm a patriot I'm a
[26:08.620 --> 26:14.500]  libertarian I'm a classical liberal you people are part of a fruitcake cult let
[26:14.500 --> 26:17.740]  me settle down for a minute Richard I'm sorry go ahead and give us your take on
[26:17.740 --> 26:22.820]  the debate I would say Trump had a pretty strong showing but for me Rand Paul
[26:22.820 --> 26:26.420]  really won the night I like how he referenced the Bill of Rights birthday
[26:26.420 --> 26:32.580]  I like how he referenced the Constitution multiple times and Trump's
[26:32.580 --> 26:36.580]  understanding of the Internet seems lacking saying that he's gonna shut down
[26:36.580 --> 26:41.500]  particular parts that just doesn't sit very well with me well I tend to agree
[26:41.500 --> 26:45.220]  with you but I think it's refreshing that Trump is out of control and
[26:45.220 --> 26:48.620]  obviously not controlled by anybody I think I'm coming on the show illustrates
[26:48.620 --> 26:51.660]  that further would you rather have a wild man who at least wants us to be
[26:51.660 --> 26:54.980]  successful or would you rather which would become a dangerous man on a white
[26:54.980 --> 27:00.660]  horse or would you rather have a madusa on a green pus filled horse or would you
[27:00.660 --> 27:05.020]  rather have a demonic vampiric socialist communist goblin like Bernie Sanders
[27:05.020 --> 27:08.980]  hopping around like an evil golem or would you rather have Jeb Bush a psycho
[27:08.980 --> 27:13.140]  ghoul the head of the bush crime family the one that's anointed the one that's
[27:13.140 --> 27:18.940]  loved by daddy bush and the whole stinking Yale takeover army I mean you
[27:18.940 --> 27:25.420]  know what do you do Richard that's quite a spread there I think I'd like
[27:25.420 --> 27:30.980]  somebody who is strong of course is bold wants to change things definitely not
[27:30.980 --> 27:40.100]  democratic but somebody who is going to do something in my interest that's what
[27:40.100 --> 27:43.620]  I'm voting for somebody that is a nationalist and thinks about policies
[27:43.620 --> 27:47.340]  that will help the country which we could easily do absolutely need to happen
[27:47.340 --> 27:50.060]  when I come back I want to talk to CJ I want to talk to anybody else in there
[27:50.060 --> 27:53.660]  that's comments Nico whoever I just want to talk to the crew and talk to the
[27:53.660 --> 27:56.900]  listeners as well but right now let's try to get this more of these clips here
[27:56.900 --> 28:05.260]  is a clip where we see the real face of little Jebi I mean these people are a
[28:05.260 --> 28:10.340]  pack of bank swindlers SNL scammers just like John McCain the Keating 5 I mean
[28:10.340 --> 28:15.940]  these are real mafia dance these are hardcore folks the bush family under
[28:15.940 --> 28:21.020]  Prescott Bush senator Bush literally was the head lawyer at Brown Brother
[28:21.020 --> 28:25.780]  Harriman managing Nazi assets in North America Central America South America
[28:25.780 --> 28:31.580]  and German shipping companies and helped cover up worldwide German Nazi front
[28:31.580 --> 28:36.740]  companies during and after World War two and then they managed that money and
[28:36.740 --> 28:41.620]  doled it out to Central and South American Nazis you know why they have
[28:41.620 --> 28:46.460]  200,000 acre ranches in South America multiple ones with military bases and
[28:46.460 --> 28:53.020]  helicopter pads see in James Bond movies where do they live that this is it
[28:53.020 --> 28:58.220]  folks these are the real deal okay let's go ahead and go out to break with
[28:58.220 --> 29:03.740]  Jeb Bush going crazy here this this is a tough business oh I know you're a tough
[29:03.740 --> 29:07.860]  guy Jeb and it's and we need to have a leader you're never going to be
[29:07.860 --> 29:15.820]  president in your way let's see I'm at 42 and you're at three so you know you
[29:15.820 --> 29:20.100]  started off over here Jeb you're moving over further and further pretty soon
[29:20.100 --> 29:26.660]  you're gonna be off the end that's good that that's another time he said it it's
[29:26.660 --> 29:32.300]  before that where he goes you will never be president and and I mean because
[29:32.300 --> 29:35.740]  he's got the delegates he's gonna swindle everything but he's been doing
[29:35.740 --> 29:39.540]  since 1938 by the way the whole Nazi thing was so big and bring down the
[29:39.540 --> 29:43.220]  whole government that's why they gave him a pass they let him off it was so big
[29:43.220 --> 29:48.620]  it's too big to fail stay with us we'll be right back on Alice Jones we're on the

[35:47.500 --> 35:53.580]  costs are actually tuning in and waking up and downloading the films and burning
[35:53.580 --> 35:56.860]  them to disk and shaving them on your hard drive because a lot of censorship

[36:01.380 --> 36:04.980]  time but defensively we're archiving things we're prepared to go low tech
[36:04.980 --> 36:09.540]  whatever it takes if they really clamped down on the internet with Obama's
[36:09.540 --> 36:14.660]  kill switch that I guess emperor Trump might use if he got the power he's been
[36:14.660 --> 36:19.700]  clarifying that's not what he means but he needs to clarify further so prison

[39:46.060 --> 39:50.660]  few jobs here in the United States like the coffee cups are made in America
[39:50.660 --> 39:54.540]  stuff like that that's what it all comes down to trying to row in the same
[39:54.540 --> 39:57.420]  direction trying to build this country back up and when you purchase products
[39:57.420 --> 40:01.900]  you are funding this operation that is a savage club of truth beating the
[40:01.900 --> 40:10.340]  globalist over the head with it every single day so 8882533139 okay I want to
[40:10.340 --> 40:14.740]  go to some more of these clips from the debate last night this is interesting
[40:14.740 --> 40:20.060]  clip from Jeb Bush then we'll go to another clip that I think Rand Paul
[40:20.060 --> 40:25.580]  really shown with last night and I would say this was the most powerful
[40:25.580 --> 40:28.940]  statement of the debate coming up where he says we'll vote for these guys if you
[40:28.940 --> 40:33.500]  want World War 3 that clips coming up as well but first this one
[40:33.500 --> 40:39.140]  Governor Bush you called Mr. Trump unhinged when he proposed banning
[40:39.140 --> 40:44.020]  non-American Muslims from the United States why is that unhinged well first
[40:44.020 --> 40:49.060]  of all we need to destroy ISIS in the caliphate that's that should be our
[40:49.060 --> 40:53.340]  objective the refugee issue will be solved if we destroy ISIS there which
[40:53.340 --> 40:57.260]  means we need to have a no-fly zone safe zones there for refugees and to build a
[40:57.260 --> 41:01.740]  military force hit boss we need to embed back it up five seconds please when
[41:01.740 --> 41:05.860]  you hear no-fly zone that means in the south of the north and and on the
[41:05.860 --> 41:10.340]  Mediterranean to totally block out the Russians and the Syrians battling al-Qaeda
[41:10.340 --> 41:14.820]  al-Nuzra and ISIS all the same group so just sounds reasonable oh let's knock
[41:14.820 --> 41:21.900]  out ISIS who they sent in to destabilize and Hillary Clinton Han showed the whole
[41:21.900 --> 41:26.740]  deal and Trump's going after for it saying she killed hundreds of thousands
[41:26.740 --> 41:31.340]  of people in Syria and Libya which she did again for every bad thing Trump says
[41:31.340 --> 41:36.180]  he said a couple things he says 15 or 20 really revolutionary things that's why
[41:36.180 --> 41:41.380]  I'm saying I like him and I see him walk back statements that he says off the cuff
[41:41.380 --> 41:46.260]  when he's you know being a tough guy I kill the families or we got a shot off
[41:46.260 --> 41:49.660]  parts of the internet to the terrorist those can be misconstrued obviously and
[41:49.660 --> 41:53.460]  he's walks them back just like he says oh bring the refugees in oh you know it's
[41:53.460 --> 41:56.300]  terrible what's happened to them and then he realizes they're not being screened
[41:56.300 --> 41:59.740]  he goes no no no don't let him in and oh now you're the biggest devil in the
[41:59.740 --> 42:03.100]  world I'm just trying to be fair about Trump here and not just mindlessly jump
[42:03.100 --> 42:10.020]  on this wolf pack shark pack attack that is so sexy and so cause celeb dumb move
[42:10.020 --> 42:13.740]  by Rand Paul to keep attacking Donald Trump last night when he's way down in
[42:13.740 --> 42:19.460]  the single digits Ted Cruz is smart Rand you ought it look at what he's doing and
[42:19.460 --> 42:23.540]  I like you Rand I know you're for real I know you're a gentleman you started
[42:23.540 --> 42:26.940]  taking the gloves off last night when it came to World War three and stuff and
[42:26.940 --> 42:31.380]  attacks on the internet that was a legitimate attack on Trump but you know
[42:31.380 --> 42:36.780]  saying he's a cook and a nut and all this stuff that's what they say about you
[42:36.780 --> 42:40.340]  I mean they want you to you know come out in bad mouth your father I know full
[42:40.340 --> 42:43.580]  well some of the folks you got working for you do that you'll differentiate
[42:43.580 --> 42:48.460]  yourself from your father your father is George Washington material in my view
[42:48.460 --> 42:52.900]  and you know that and your dad brought you along and you believe everything your
[42:52.900 --> 42:57.940]  dad believes they don't like you because they know that Rand they know you try to
[42:57.940 --> 43:01.500]  moderate it's not for real just be yourself and you can become president
[43:01.500 --> 43:07.140]  next year enough of a rant on that subject let's go back to Jeb Bush
[43:07.140 --> 43:11.940]  sons there for refugees and to build a military force we need to embed our
[43:11.940 --> 43:16.220]  forces our troops inside the Iraqi military we need to arm directly the
[43:16.220 --> 43:21.060]  Kurds and all of that has to be done in concert with the Arab nations and if
[43:21.060 --> 43:24.500]  we're going to ban all Muslims how are we going to get them to be part of a
[43:24.500 --> 43:28.340]  coalition to destroy ISIS the Kurds are the greatest fighting force and our
[43:28.340 --> 43:33.820]  strongest allies they're Muslim look this is not a serious proposal in fact it
[43:33.820 --> 43:38.140]  will push the Muslim world the Arab world away from us at a time when we
[43:38.140 --> 43:43.020]  need to re-engage with them to be able to create a strategy to destroy ISIS so
[43:43.020 --> 43:48.380]  Donald you know is great at at the one-liners but he's a chaos candidate
[43:48.380 --> 43:53.540]  and he'd be a chaos president he would not be the commander in chief we need to
[43:53.540 --> 44:00.740]  keep our country say bushes and the Trump caused on record Leslie Clark
[44:00.740 --> 44:05.580]  exposed it keep going or later we'll come back with Trump's response but
[44:05.580 --> 44:09.340]  Trump points out I'm the one that said two years ago bomb Al Qaeda now ISIS is
[44:09.340 --> 44:12.740]  oil I'm the one that said you know we've got to deal with them first and then
[44:12.740 --> 44:17.260]  Assad which if you actually wanted to help Syria you could argue that it's
[44:17.260 --> 44:20.860]  still international war crime you shouldn't be involved in regime changes
[44:20.860 --> 44:25.220]  some I didn't attack you but the globalist plan is to destabilize those
[44:25.220 --> 44:29.900]  countries forever make them failed states Iraq Libya Syria Egypt that's a
[44:29.900 --> 44:33.500]  crime against humanity and the globalists want to do that to us turning
[44:33.500 --> 44:37.700]  off our power plants jacking with our families screwing our kids up shipping
[44:37.700 --> 44:42.020]  drugs into the country it's the admitted plan I'm gonna go to Kit Daniels one of
[44:42.020 --> 44:46.540]  our info wars.com investigative journalists and writers to get his
[44:46.540 --> 44:50.500]  comment on the debates then we're gonna go to the big kahuna clip the one that
[44:50.500 --> 44:55.900]  made me start loving Rand Paul again I gotta tell you when he said you are a
[44:55.900 --> 45:00.620]  bunch of crazy World War three nuts when they were up there I'll punch Putin in
[45:00.620 --> 45:05.860]  the nose the Russians in the nose yeah shoot their planes down watching these
[45:05.860 --> 45:12.620]  two super wimpy governor case at governor Christie just just just just
[45:12.620 --> 45:18.580]  stink of hypocrisy and fraud and and and and overall buck-toothedness I mean
[45:18.580 --> 45:25.620]  they are just such slimy little interloping miscreants pushing World War
[45:25.620 --> 45:30.220]  three and the end of our planet I mean this is psychotalk even the most
[45:30.220 --> 45:34.620]  psycho killers like Hitler and Stalin who had killed people and then all sorts
[45:34.620 --> 45:39.380]  of exploits Hitler had the Congressional Medal of Honor Iron Cross first class
[45:39.380 --> 45:44.860]  folks and second class I mean he was a war hero killed a bunch of people ran
[45:44.860 --> 45:47.980]  through the enemy lines I mean I'm not saying Hitler was a good guy but he was
[45:47.980 --> 45:53.180]  super tough got gassed twice that's why everybody was following him in the
[45:53.180 --> 45:57.660]  military because the guy survived going between enemy lines with messages that
[45:57.660 --> 46:01.860]  no one had survived as long as he did he would crawl out after being nerve gas
[46:01.860 --> 46:07.180]  refuse orders and go back to the front because he was a demon he loved war but
[46:07.180 --> 46:14.780]  the point is that they have totally jacked all this where we've got weirdos
[46:14.780 --> 46:18.460]  like these governors up there shooting their mouths off about attacking
[46:18.460 --> 46:22.380]  Russians and blooding their noses and generals on TV say when he lots of
[46:22.380 --> 46:26.340]  Russian body bags when the West is encircling Russia attacking Russia
[46:26.340 --> 46:32.140]  we're not Nazi Germany we're not Napoleonic France no these people are
[46:32.140 --> 46:38.260]  psycho crazies they're nuts not even dictators shoot their mouths off like
[46:38.260 --> 46:44.820]  this this is so beyond third world this is so embarrassing in history kid Daniels
[46:44.820 --> 46:50.300]  your take on the situation well this whole debate is a microcosm to how the
[46:50.300 --> 46:55.060]  establishment is completely losing the narrative I mean I generally like Donald
[46:55.060 --> 46:58.020]  Trump you know as a libertarian I do have some concerns about some things he
[46:58.020 --> 47:02.780]  says but let's not lose focus on the fact that he's pulling the overton window
[47:02.780 --> 47:07.300]  towards liberty I've honestly in research in history I've never seen
[47:07.300 --> 47:10.260]  anything like this since the Revolutionary War as far as the free flow of
[47:10.260 --> 47:16.460]  information and how we see a super populist like Trump showing up sorry
[47:16.460 --> 47:20.180]  go ahead the elite don't like what he's saying or doing he is moving the debate
[47:20.180 --> 47:26.340]  way back towards 1776 the needles going from 1984 to 1776 big time right now
[47:26.340 --> 47:30.260]  yeah that's what they I think that's what they fear more most than him being
[47:30.260 --> 47:36.100]  president is the fact that he is turning the tide against the establishment by
[47:36.100 --> 47:39.980]  controlling the narrative I mean the establishment particularly mainstream
[47:39.980 --> 47:45.260]  media no matter how much they attack him he keeps getting bigger and bigger and
[47:45.260 --> 47:49.540]  bigger and that is a huge blow to the establishment's control over the
[47:49.540 --> 47:53.940]  population and that's the mainstream media is the primary method of how they
[47:53.940 --> 47:58.060]  engineer consent on the world's population the billions of people as you
[47:58.060 --> 48:02.580]  and I both know and a lot of listeners to show both no well to give some folks
[48:02.580 --> 48:06.020]  some insight into that that I've been spending a lot of time investigating
[48:06.020 --> 48:11.500]  Trump not just through some of his crew and former crew but through some other
[48:11.500 --> 48:15.460]  people I know that know him they go listen Donald Trump's for real he's
[48:15.460 --> 48:19.820]  beyond a narcissist he literally is so positive so aggressive he works about
[48:19.820 --> 48:24.580]  18 hours a day weekdays he loves reading letters he loves doing deals he loves
[48:24.580 --> 48:27.460]  looking at blueprints he loves helicoptering around looking at his
[48:27.460 --> 48:31.380]  properties he loves rewarding staff that's good firing staff that's bad and
[48:31.380 --> 48:35.340]  he really does want America to be great and he loves to be told how great he is
[48:35.340 --> 48:42.180]  to me associates himself with America and nationalism and that's why I was
[48:42.180 --> 48:45.420]  saying you know George Washington was really great and he was super cool and
[48:45.420 --> 48:49.300]  Trump goes yeah that's what they say he just wanted to get back to Donald Trump
[48:49.300 --> 48:54.780]  being great and that's not perfect folks but here's the deal it's better than
[48:54.780 --> 48:57.820]  Hillary that wants to destroy this country and mount its head on the wall
[48:57.820 --> 49:02.020]  and bring in a stinking anti-human world government that's what Bernie Sanders
[49:02.020 --> 49:08.220]  that literal dirtbag wants that's what Jeb Bush a dangerous crime lord dangerous
[49:08.220 --> 49:11.860]  crime lord if you look into his whole past I mean these are dangerous hardcore
[49:11.860 --> 49:15.540]  sinister people I know my life's in danger every time I shoot my mouth off
[49:15.540 --> 49:18.820]  about them because they might just pull the trigger I mean they the bushes do not
[49:18.820 --> 49:26.580]  play games folks okay they are hardcore they make you know people like drug
[49:26.580 --> 49:30.220]  lords in Mexico and stuff look like wimps I mean they've taken this country
[49:30.220 --> 49:33.900]  over they run things with the Clintons who work for them now are the Clintons
[49:33.900 --> 49:39.060]  double-crossing them at this point I don't know but they are serious and so
[49:39.060 --> 49:43.620]  Trump might end up getting elected and might be horrible probably not though my
[49:43.620 --> 49:48.740]  gut tells me if we put pressure on him in a good way the but we know what we've
[49:48.740 --> 49:53.380]  got with these globalist crime lords Kit Daniels yeah you remember that move
[49:53.380 --> 49:57.180]  from 1980s a weekend at Bernie's I think I was called where they're taking
[49:57.180 --> 50:00.780]  around this dead body and for ten years alive that's Jeb Bush campaign right now
[50:00.780 --> 50:06.660]  I mean today I go I'll get online in the coffee shop and I look at the articles
[50:06.660 --> 50:09.900]  and there's one I think the hill that wrote that in the lead sentence it's
[50:09.900 --> 50:14.180]  like Jeb Bush won the debate and then I see other articles saying kind of the
[50:14.180 --> 50:19.260]  same thing it's almost like I have to question maybe the Bush campaigns paying
[50:19.260 --> 50:24.420]  off these reporters to write these articles as you know public relations
[50:24.420 --> 50:28.380]  sure he's three points in most polls he had some of the biggest applause is they
[50:28.380 --> 50:33.220]  even pack that with the GOP national controlling it the GOP national said we
[50:33.220 --> 50:37.340]  don't care what Trump does we don't care what anybody else does we will deliver
[50:37.340 --> 50:41.580]  the delegates to Jeb Bush and no matter what well we're going to expose that and
[50:41.580 --> 50:45.020]  fight that we're not gonna wait till they try to do that on midnight the night

[54:17.660 --> 54:25.400]  world we're thrown like a dog without a bone and here is part of the incredible
[54:25.400 --> 54:30.380]  exchange with Kristi Kasek and Rand Paul. And this is the most powerful exchange the
[54:30.380 --> 54:35.180]  night Rand Paul. I think pretty much wins the debate. Uh, Trump in second place because
[54:35.180 --> 54:39.840]  of this statement right here about World War three. Remember, we're attacking Russia blowing
[54:39.840 --> 54:45.040]  up Ukraine. Russia just responds very calmly, very lovingly with sanctions against Turkey
[54:45.040 --> 54:48.720]  and stuff. Well, while our leaders say let's kill Russians, I mean, this is foaming at
[54:48.720 --> 54:53.560]  the mouth, bloodthirsty piranha behavior that you see out of ISIS. Here it is.
[54:53.560 --> 55:00.220]  Foreign policy, you have to know how to pick and choose. There's no way if Saddam had not
[55:00.220 --> 55:04.600]  had weapons of mass destruction, I would have gone because I don't believe that U.S. should
[55:04.600 --> 55:10.000]  be involved directly in civil wars. I opposed the U.S. involvement in Lebanon. We ended up
[55:10.000 --> 55:15.320]  having to withdraw our Marines after our barracks were blown up. There's a difference between
[55:15.320 --> 55:21.440]  Iraq where you have Sunni, Shia and Kurds put together after First World War by the
[55:21.440 --> 55:27.240]  Western powers. It doesn't work. It needs to break up into three parts. And finally you,
[55:27.240 --> 55:35.240]  in regard to Syria, understand that Assad is an ally of Iran who wants to extend that
[55:35.240 --> 55:41.640]  shia radicalism all the way across the Middle East. He has to go and for the Russians, frankly,
[55:41.640 --> 55:44.880]  it's time that we punch the Russians in the nose. They've gotten away with too much in
[55:44.880 --> 55:50.320]  this world and we need to stand up against them, not just there, but also in Eastern
[55:50.320 --> 55:53.320]  Europe, where they threaten some of our most precious allies.
[55:53.320 --> 55:58.120]  Let's continue with Russia. Right now, we have another question from Facebook. Listen
[55:58.120 --> 55:59.120]  to her.
[55:59.120 --> 56:05.280]  My name is Ashley Topol. Ms. Fiorina, in November, you said that you would not talk to Vladimir
[56:05.280 --> 56:08.680]  Putin after you were elected because you would be communicating from a position of weakness.
[56:08.680 --> 56:11.960]  Do you believe that it is feasible to not communicate with another world leader and
[56:11.960 --> 56:14.720]  do you think that that also is a sign of weakness?
[56:14.720 --> 56:19.040]  Ms. Fiorina, as you know, U.S. and Russian warplanes, they're flying all over Syria right
[56:19.040 --> 56:23.880]  now with so many lives on the line. Is this a good time for the United States not to talk
[56:23.880 --> 56:24.880]  to Putin?
[56:24.880 --> 56:28.760]  I didn't say I would cut off all communication with Putin. What I said was, as President
[56:28.760 --> 56:34.360]  of the United States now is not the time to talk with him. Reagan walked away at Reykjavik.
[56:34.360 --> 56:38.240]  There is a time and a place for everything. There is a time and a place for talk and there
[56:38.240 --> 56:45.040]  is a time and a place for action. I know Vladimir Putin. He respects strength. He lied to our
[56:45.040 --> 56:49.920]  president's face, didn't bother to tell him about warplanes and troops going into Syria.
[56:49.920 --> 56:54.320]  We need to speak to him from a position of strength. So as Commander-in-Chief, I will
[56:54.320 --> 57:00.000]  not speak to him until we've set up that no-fly zone, until we've gathered our Sunni
[57:00.000 --> 57:05.120]  allies and begun to deny ISIS territory, until I've called the Supreme Leader of Iran
[57:05.120 --> 57:10.640]  and told him, New Deal, we the United States of America are going to cut off the money
[57:10.640 --> 57:15.040]  flow, which we can do, which we don't need anyone's permission or collaboration to do,
[57:15.040 --> 57:19.040]  and I will not speak to him personally until we've rebuilt the Sixth Fleet a little bit
[57:19.040 --> 57:23.160]  right under his nose, rebuilt the Missile Defense Program in Poland right under his
[57:23.160 --> 57:24.160]  nose.
[57:24.160 --> 57:29.000]  He conducted a few military exercises in the Baltic States. And let us remember one other
[57:29.000 --> 57:30.000]  thing.
[57:30.000 --> 57:31.000]  Is that really Caitlyn Jenner?
[57:31.000 --> 57:36.120]  Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are responsible for the growth of ISIS because they precipitously
[57:36.120 --> 57:42.040]  withdrew from Iraq in 2011 against the advice of every single general and their political
[57:42.040 --> 57:43.040]  expediency.
[57:43.040 --> 57:46.160]  Oh, it's great to go on Iraq and he stabilized the whole thing. To break it in three parts
[57:46.160 --> 57:47.160]  was the plan.
[57:47.160 --> 57:49.520]  It's all planned, folks.
[57:49.520 --> 57:55.680]  If the U.S. imposed a no-fly zone over Syria and a Russian plane encroached and invaded
[57:55.680 --> 58:00.680]  that no-fly zone, would you be prepared to shoot down that Russian plane and risk war
[58:00.680 --> 58:01.840]  with Russia?
[58:01.840 --> 58:04.240]  Not only would we prepare to do it, I would do it.
[58:04.240 --> 58:10.040]  No-fly zone means a no-fly zone. Wolf, that's what it means. See, maybe...
[58:10.040 --> 58:11.040]  No-writing refrigerator means no-writing refrigerator.
[58:11.040 --> 58:12.040]  No-writing refrigerator.
[58:12.040 --> 58:16.160]  I just have this kind of plain language hangout. But I would make a break or I would not talk
[58:16.160 --> 58:17.160]  to Vladimir Putin.
[58:17.160 --> 58:19.040]  In fact, I would talk to Vladimir Putin a lot.
[58:19.040 --> 58:23.680]  And I would say to him, listen, Mr. President, there's no-fly zone in Syria. You fly in,
[58:23.680 --> 58:27.320]  it applies to you. And yes, we would shoot down the planes of Russian pilots.
[58:27.320 --> 58:28.320]  Because you're gone.
[58:28.320 --> 58:32.320]  Because in fact, they were stupid enough to think that this president was the same feckless
[58:32.320 --> 58:34.760]  weakling that the president we have in the Oval Office is right now.
[58:34.760 --> 58:37.920]  And you make the good points with that. The neocons are running this operation. We'll
[58:37.920 --> 58:43.000]  be back, folks, with Rand Paul's response, second hour, seventy seconds away.

[59:51.440 --> 1:00:17.440]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:17.440 --> 1:00:46.360]  The info war has achieved liftoffs. We'll be in orbit soon. Targeting enemy globalist
[1:00:46.360 --> 1:00:52.920]  lives with even more firepower. We've only just begun in the beta testing of the resistance
[1:00:52.920 --> 1:01:03.720]  and hacking the globalist propaganda system. Directing the narrative back into the reality
[1:01:03.720 --> 1:01:09.200]  zone. I am your host, Alex Jones, coming up. James O'Keefe of the Veritas Project or
[1:01:09.200 --> 1:01:14.520]  Project Veritas. Then, Harry Dent in studio on what's really happening in the economy
[1:01:14.520 --> 1:01:20.160]  and more. House Dems push assault weapons ban. It's all coming up. German court lets
[1:01:20.160 --> 1:01:26.240]  off Sharia police patrol in German city. They're actually allowed to be vigilantes. They're
[1:01:26.240 --> 1:01:29.920]  not allowed to demonstrate against them, but they're allowed to do whatever they want because
[1:01:29.920 --> 1:01:35.040]  they're the new shocktrips of the socialist, the friends of women.
[1:01:35.040 --> 1:01:41.200]  But first, let's go back to the chipmunk, excuse me, the giant gopher like creature.
[1:01:41.200 --> 1:01:45.200]  What are those big gophers called? I don't mean that to be goofy how he looks, but he
[1:01:45.200 --> 1:01:49.720]  looks like one of those giant burrowing rodents. Is it a woodchuck?
[1:01:49.720 --> 1:01:50.720]  Capybara.
[1:01:50.720 --> 1:01:59.680]  Is it a, what's that other one called? Groundhog. I mean, Chris Christie is an open borders anti-gun
[1:01:59.680 --> 1:02:06.840]  chump. And he's up here saying, I would call up and threaten Vladimir Putin. You don't
[1:02:06.840 --> 1:02:12.480]  fly planes in there. A sovereign nation's been invaded by the West for five years. Maybe
[1:02:12.480 --> 1:02:19.840]  he's in Nutria. All this stuff's going on. And the response of Governor Kasich and Governor
[1:02:19.840 --> 1:02:25.240]  Christie is punch the Russians in the nose. That's a quote from Kasich and call it Putin
[1:02:25.240 --> 1:02:29.520]  and threatening will blow your planes up. They know you've already blown up Ukraine
[1:02:29.520 --> 1:02:34.000]  and put fascist in and overthrew the elected government and blown up the power and bombed
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:42.720]  the power plants. And all trade into Crimea will be shut off next week. The hijacked leaders
[1:02:42.720 --> 1:02:46.720]  of Ukraine just said today, I mean, believe me, Russia, it gives speeches saying never
[1:02:46.720 --> 1:02:50.440]  since World War II, we've been under this attack. We're encircled. We've got the nuclear
[1:02:50.440 --> 1:02:54.440]  forces ready. We believe they may head us first. They're dangerous neocons who are
[1:02:54.440 --> 1:02:58.480]  psychotic. The bunkers are being built for the public. Prepare. We just want to keep
[1:02:58.480 --> 1:03:03.840]  Russia from collapsing. We're trying our best. And meanwhile, our guys are bloody nose,
[1:03:03.840 --> 1:03:10.520]  body bags, kill the Roskies. I mean, Hitler didn't shoot his mouth off like that. It's
[1:03:10.520 --> 1:03:16.480]  just so unmanly. It's so even even warlords who were tough stuff don't act like this.
[1:03:16.480 --> 1:03:21.240]  I mean, this is real Third World General stuff, you know, with 14 stars on their little
[1:03:21.240 --> 1:03:26.560]  pills. These guys are a bunch of neocons, chicken, not neck cowards. Let's go back to
[1:03:26.560 --> 1:03:33.720]  Rand Paul's devastating response. Governor Christie, if the U.S. imposed a no fly zone
[1:03:33.720 --> 1:03:39.560]  over Syria and a Russian plane encroached invaded that no fly zone, would you be prepared
[1:03:39.560 --> 1:03:44.200]  to shoot down that Russian plane and a risk war with Russia? Not only are we prepared
[1:03:44.200 --> 1:03:50.000]  to do it, I would do it. A no fly zone means a no fly zone. Wolf, that's what it means.
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:55.560]  See, maybe maybe because I'm from New Jersey, I just have this kind of plain language hangout.
[1:03:55.560 --> 1:03:59.320]  But I wouldn't make break or I wouldn't not talk to Vladimir Putin. In fact, I would
[1:03:59.320 --> 1:04:03.040]  talk to Vladimir Putin a lot. And I would say to him, listen, Mr. President, there's
[1:04:03.040 --> 1:04:07.920]  no fly zone in Syria. You fly in, it applies to you. And yes, we would shoot down the planes
[1:04:07.920 --> 1:04:12.680]  of Russian pilots if in fact they were stupid enough to think that this president was the
[1:04:12.680 --> 1:04:21.000]  same feckless weakling that the president we have in the Oval Office is right now.
[1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:27.400]  Senator Paul, Senator Paul, I want you to respond to what we just heard from Governor
[1:04:27.400 --> 1:04:32.960]  Christie. If there was a no fly zone, you say that potentially could lead to World War
[1:04:32.960 --> 1:04:38.080]  III. Why? Well, I think if you're in favor of World War III, you have your candidate.
[1:04:38.080 --> 1:04:41.800]  You know, here's the thing. We're going to come back with the rest of his response.
[1:04:41.800 --> 1:04:46.440]  Let's, let's, let's pack it up to Wolf Blitzer. The admitted Israeli Mossad operative, I'm
[1:04:46.440 --> 1:04:51.840]  not against Israelis or anybody. I just want you to know that Anderson Cooper CIA, and
[1:04:51.840 --> 1:04:57.280]  then you've got the former head of the big Israel pack and a known agent, Wolf Blitzer
[1:04:57.280 --> 1:04:59.280]  up there.
[1:04:59.280 --> 1:05:08.680]  That's right. The feds are coming to town. The FAA has just sent their dictate throughout
[1:05:08.680 --> 1:05:14.200]  the land. Any motorized planes heavier than a half pound, I repeat, a half pound will
[1:05:14.200 --> 1:05:19.240]  have to be registered by December 21st. If Santa gives you one, you can't fly it outside
[1:05:19.240 --> 1:05:25.880]  without registering it on their list. Fail to do so. And the FAA will fine you $27,500
[1:05:25.880 --> 1:05:31.040]  without due process, calling it a civil fine. If they come after you criminally, quarter
[1:05:31.040 --> 1:05:36.200]  of a million dollars and three years in jail for not registering your half pound and heavier
[1:05:36.200 --> 1:05:40.400]  plane. This regulation won't do anything to enforce the current prohibitions of flying
[1:05:40.400 --> 1:05:45.800]  close to airports. And they should be concerned if they can't protect airports from toy planes.
[1:05:45.800 --> 1:05:50.520]  Because that means they certainly can't protect airports from shoulder fired missiles. And
[1:05:50.520 --> 1:05:54.400]  guess what? The jihadis won't be registering those with the FAA.
[1:05:54.400 --> 1:06:09.920]  From ForWorst.com, I'm David Knight, and we're starting to see big effects. And the word
[1:06:09.920 --> 1:06:14.920]  is getting out. The globalists want to make us dependent. And as Napoleon famously said,
[1:06:14.920 --> 1:06:19.880]  an army marches on its stomach. Ammunition, food and supplies form the backbone of any
[1:06:19.880 --> 1:06:25.600]  offensive, including the Info War. And our enemies admit they're losing the Info War.
[1:06:25.600 --> 1:06:29.440]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[1:06:29.440 --> 1:06:33.840]  With this in mind, we have held strong to our principles and the decision to refuse
[1:06:33.840 --> 1:06:38.360]  any money from globalists or government. We are funding our crusade against tyranny the
[1:06:38.360 --> 1:06:44.680]  old fashioned way with pure free market, free will capitalism. Visit InfoWarStore.com today

[1:08:19.760 --> 1:08:28.160]  Center in the heart of the Resistance. It's Alex Jones. Huma Abedin, the admitted Muslim
[1:08:28.160 --> 1:08:35.400]  brotherhood mole, but over here she can dress in fancy dresses and hang out with Hillary
[1:08:35.400 --> 1:08:41.920]  Clinton in the same hotel room. They're really good friends and that's fine. But the potential
[1:08:41.920 --> 1:08:48.080]  first lady, the woman who could potentially be the shadow first lady got caught by James
[1:08:48.080 --> 1:08:52.560]  O'Keeffe undercover reporter and some pretty serious stuff and then of course O'Keeffe's
[1:08:52.560 --> 1:08:55.640]  got some other big breaking undercover news and then he's a little under the weather today
[1:08:55.640 --> 1:08:58.760]  so he's just going to do 20 minutes with us. He's going to come back in the new year
[1:08:58.760 --> 1:09:01.920]  with something potentially and I know what it is but I'm not going to say I appreciate
[1:09:01.920 --> 1:09:07.840]  him sharing it with us in confidence as big as Acorn or bigger. Okay and this is a guy
[1:09:07.840 --> 1:09:12.000]  that has helped blow up corrupt organizations that were getting up to $4 billion a year
[1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:16.920]  in taxpayer money. He's like the Patriot Death Star to the New World Order and of course
[1:09:16.920 --> 1:09:21.200]  they don't see his praises, they arrest him, they try to indict him. He is a true 21st
[1:09:21.200 --> 1:09:24.800]  century polar here. I'm not kissing his butt folks, I don't do that for very many guests
[1:09:24.800 --> 1:09:29.360]  but James O'Keeffe, I'm a big fan of him and he's a bestselling author as well. You
[1:09:29.360 --> 1:09:35.040]  can find out more at projectveritas.com. If you're not supporting them, you're basically
[1:09:35.040 --> 1:09:38.520]  aiding and abetting the globalist. I mean I'm done talking. Let's go to a clip of this
[1:09:38.520 --> 1:09:43.640]  undercover report with Hillary Clinton's girl. Here it is.
[1:09:43.640 --> 1:09:48.000]  When we were able to catch the vice chairwoman after her speech, she made it clear that Hillary
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:51.720]  is all in favor of allowing Syrian refugees into the country.
[1:09:51.720 --> 1:09:58.960]  Thank you so much for addressing the Syrian refugee crisis. Because honestly, the Glamocodio
[1:09:58.960 --> 1:10:03.080]  is rampant and you have to promise me like if Hillary is elected president she's going
[1:10:03.080 --> 1:10:07.680]  to do everything she can to let the Syrians in because the Republicans are doing everything
[1:10:07.680 --> 1:10:21.080]  they can to ban them. And I think the Syrian people know that Hillary is the answer for
[1:10:21.080 --> 1:10:34.400]  them too. I think they know. That kind of talk is music to the ears of the Syrian men we
[1:10:34.400 --> 1:10:48.560]  met in Athens, Greece recently. They say politics makes strange bedfellows. I guess they are
[1:10:48.560 --> 1:10:53.440]  right. Here we found Syrian refugees looking to get to northern Europe or to the United
[1:10:53.440 --> 1:11:00.480]  States by any means possible, suggesting even using fake passports. And they are unabashed
[1:11:00.480 --> 1:11:07.040]  Hillary supporters. You know we need to travel to Germany. How are you going to do that?
[1:11:07.040 --> 1:11:16.160]  Maybe by a plane, by a fake passport. We like Hillary Clinton if she has action to
[1:11:16.160 --> 1:11:21.080]  finish Syria. What about now? Do you like her? Who? Do you like her now though? Like what
[1:11:21.080 --> 1:11:27.440]  she's done so far? I believe maybe we can do something. Smile.
[1:11:27.440 --> 1:11:32.400]  Because voting ID laws are so lax in so many states, these Syrian refugees might just be
[1:11:32.400 --> 1:11:38.120]  able to vote for Hillary. If, as she supports, they can get into the United States.
[1:11:38.120 --> 1:11:42.280]  And this is the political plan. And then make them a protected group that can whine and complain
[1:11:42.280 --> 1:11:47.200]  and go around and bully people with Sharia law. German court lets off Sharia police patrol
[1:11:47.200 --> 1:11:54.360]  in major German city. That's BBC today. They can just run around to whatever they want.
[1:11:54.360 --> 1:11:58.040]  And again folks, the reason James O'Keeffe is so amazing. He's gone through so much.
[1:11:58.040 --> 1:12:02.760]  He's built such an organization. He keeps really wounding the globalists grievously
[1:12:02.760 --> 1:12:07.960]  and their agendas. And he's the model for everybody else with investigative journalists
[1:12:07.960 --> 1:12:13.200]  that undercover stuff. I mean, I was around before James O'Keeffe doing some similar things,
[1:12:13.200 --> 1:12:18.600]  but not with the skill, the focus, the dedication. He is somebody I learned from. And the reason
[1:12:18.600 --> 1:12:23.800]  I brag about it is we don't give patriots enough kudos because we need to understand
[1:12:23.800 --> 1:12:29.800]  the success we're all having. That we're bigger than the mainstream media. I get 20 million
[1:12:29.800 --> 1:12:35.840]  viewers or listeners a week now, conservatively. In fact, it's grown. Think about that. Think
[1:12:35.840 --> 1:12:39.200]  about what we're all doing together. We are becoming the majority. People are waking up.
[1:12:39.200 --> 1:12:42.360]  All right, James, I know you're under the weathers. We'll just keep you to 30 after.
[1:12:42.360 --> 1:12:45.440]  Appreciate you coming on. I tell you, you really got my heart racing with the news.
[1:12:45.440 --> 1:12:49.280]  You were relayed to the producer earlier. Can't wait till you break that. But break
[1:12:49.280 --> 1:12:52.560]  into this and then get into your other big kudos that you and your crew have been carrying
[1:12:52.560 --> 1:12:54.880]  out. Yes. Thank you, Alex. And thank you for the
[1:12:54.880 --> 1:12:58.960]  compliments. I'm very impressed by what you built. Like I told you last time, I love
[1:12:58.960 --> 1:13:04.200]  the work you've done about 10 years ago, going to the DMV in Texas and forcing those people
[1:13:04.200 --> 1:13:08.160]  showing them 11 different forms of ID and then they still want to take your blood. So
[1:13:08.160 --> 1:13:10.680]  that was an inspiration to me early on. So thank you very much.
[1:13:10.680 --> 1:13:14.780]  Thank you, brother. Yeah. This whole thing we did on the, on the
[1:13:14.780 --> 1:13:20.440]  Syrians, we went to Greece and we interviewed a lot of these so-called refugees and illegal
[1:13:20.440 --> 1:13:24.760]  immigrants coming into Greece. And some of these guys were talking to us about how much
[1:13:24.760 --> 1:13:30.080]  it costs to get a fake passport to get into the United States. One of them says $3,000,
[1:13:30.080 --> 1:13:35.160]  3,000 euro to get a fake passport. And what they told us they were doing, these are people
[1:13:35.160 --> 1:13:40.360]  we interviewed on the street with hidden cameras. These are the exact same types of people that
[1:13:40.360 --> 1:13:45.320]  went on to France and committed the bombings. And they all love Hillary Clinton. And that's
[1:13:45.320 --> 1:13:51.520]  what our hidden camera expose is showed. And in terms of Huma, we do go to the fundraisers
[1:13:51.520 --> 1:13:55.760]  with hidden cameras for Hillary Clinton. That's when we interviewed Huma. We also have people
[1:13:55.760 --> 1:14:00.840]  right now, and I'm happy to say this to you, working for Hillary Clinton that are working
[1:14:00.840 --> 1:14:06.160]  for Project Veritas. And we have built kind of like a, kind of like how they have their
[1:14:06.160 --> 1:14:11.160]  intelligence agencies. We've built our own kind of intelligence journalistic operation.
[1:14:11.160 --> 1:14:16.520]  And we have a number of these undercover people reporting back to us throughout 2016. So in
[1:14:16.520 --> 1:14:22.160]  terms of the Syrian stuff, it's pretty straightforward. I mean, these guys are blatant about their
[1:14:22.160 --> 1:14:25.320]  plans to come to the United States. They're telling us how much money it costs to buy
[1:14:25.320 --> 1:14:28.160]  the fake passports, and they all love Hillary Clinton.
[1:14:28.160 --> 1:14:32.640]  Shouldn't she be congressionally investigated, Hillary's girl, for being so blatant about
[1:14:32.640 --> 1:14:38.400]  this? And look, I'm a libertarian, so I don't get into bashing lesbians and bisexuals and
[1:14:38.400 --> 1:14:41.680]  people as long as they don't promote it to kids. But I mean, obviously it's well known
[1:14:41.680 --> 1:14:46.520]  that she's hooked up with Hillary that Hillary has seen more tale than a toilet seat, quote
[1:14:46.520 --> 1:14:51.160]  Bill Clinton. And so she should just be honest about it. Is this going to be the first lady?
[1:14:51.160 --> 1:14:56.000]  I mean, shouldn't Hillary's potential first lady be investigated further? And by the way,
[1:14:56.000 --> 1:15:00.240]  talk about courage, James. You know, messing with Hillary's girl, she might really come
[1:15:00.240 --> 1:15:01.240]  after you.
[1:15:01.240 --> 1:15:06.800]  Well, we did, Alex, we did watch a story back in September where we actually caught one
[1:15:06.800 --> 1:15:12.120]  of Hillary's attorneys in Nevada saying, just break the laws, just break the rules on voter
[1:15:12.120 --> 1:15:17.520]  registration. We caught this on tape, and this attorney, Christina Gupana, is her name.
[1:15:17.520 --> 1:15:22.760]  She just completely disappeared. I mean, we could not find, I don't think she works there
[1:15:22.760 --> 1:15:29.840]  anymore, and nobody knows where she went. So it's kind of mafia-like tactics that we have
[1:15:29.840 --> 1:15:35.600]  discovered in the Hillary campaign. In terms of fear, Alex, you know, we built an organization,
[1:15:35.600 --> 1:15:40.160]  we have 100,000 people that we distribute to. So I think Hillary's got to be careful
[1:15:40.160 --> 1:15:44.560]  about retaliating against people like me or people like you, because all it does is sort
[1:15:44.560 --> 1:15:51.480]  of waking up the beast. The people, the audience that we have, I think that the last thing
[1:15:51.480 --> 1:15:53.120]  Hillary wants to do is engage.
[1:15:53.120 --> 1:15:57.080]  I agree. They don't want to make us martyrs. And that's what really freaks them out. She
[1:15:57.080 --> 1:16:01.360]  admits she's losing the info war to Congress three years ago, as you know. What do you
[1:16:01.360 --> 1:16:05.680]  expect them to do next? I'm going to get into your other big coup with this attorney general.
[1:16:05.680 --> 1:16:09.320]  I mean, they are getting mad. They are talking to all the think tanks openly saying, what
[1:16:09.320 --> 1:16:14.200]  do we do to shut down the libertarian patriot movement? How do we censor these folks? Matt
[1:16:14.200 --> 1:16:17.480]  Drudge, as you know, has been told by a major Supreme Court justice that they're coming
[1:16:17.480 --> 1:16:21.440]  for us. Him, you, myself, and others next year.
[1:16:21.440 --> 1:16:26.920]  I saw the interview do with Matt Drudge, but phenomenal scoop, by the way. I mean, I agree
[1:16:26.920 --> 1:16:31.760]  with Matt Drudge. I mean, you're going to have to, this is, this is a courageous fight.
[1:16:31.760 --> 1:16:36.840]  And we have, Project Veritas is going where no one else has ever gone before. We're building
[1:16:36.840 --> 1:16:42.400]  our own journalistic kind of intelligence gathering operation. We're putting people
[1:16:42.400 --> 1:16:48.240]  behind enemy lines with hidden cameras. We're going to candidate events, the fundraisers.
[1:16:48.240 --> 1:16:52.520]  We have people working for campaigns that are reporting back to us. How do you, how do
[1:16:52.520 --> 1:16:57.720]  we not shut you down? Maybe they will, but we're going to give it the best shot in 2016.
[1:16:57.720 --> 1:17:00.880]  And they've tried to put me in jail before. You know that. I've been on your program
[1:17:00.880 --> 1:17:05.000]  to discuss this, but I think we're kind of like the Death Star. At this point, if they
[1:17:05.000 --> 1:17:10.240]  shoot into us, it only makes us bigger and bolder and batter. And when I was, when I
[1:17:10.240 --> 1:17:14.960]  was one person, one man, I mean, they can shut down one guy, but they cannot shut down
[1:17:14.960 --> 1:17:20.040]  an army of exposers and investigators. And that's what we need to do. We need to build
[1:17:20.040 --> 1:17:25.080]  the army. If your audience is interested in becoming a videographer reporter, contact
[1:17:25.080 --> 1:17:29.520]  Project Veritas.com and we will equip you. We will mobilize you. We will deploy you.
[1:17:29.520 --> 1:17:32.920]  They are unable to shut down more than one man.
[1:17:32.920 --> 1:17:37.280]  Absolutely. And I intend to try to get even more reporters on staff and also get auxiliaries
[1:17:37.280 --> 1:17:40.880]  around the country as well, because we're not in competition. We are fighting for the
[1:17:40.880 --> 1:17:45.040]  life of this country. And I use the Death Star analogy because of the firepower blowing
[1:17:45.040 --> 1:17:49.320]  up some of their biggest on the ground, frauds like Acron. I mean, that was a devastating
[1:17:49.320 --> 1:17:54.320]  evil organization. You guys literally destroyed it with the truth or they destroyed themselves.
[1:17:54.320 --> 1:17:58.800]  But flipping back to the Star Wars analogy, it's more like you've got 100,000 X-wings
[1:17:58.800 --> 1:18:03.840]  in your group. And so do we, that they can't hit us all. They can't get us all because
[1:18:03.840 --> 1:18:07.960]  we're just all over the place because they didn't, they didn't see a small one man or
[1:18:07.960 --> 1:18:13.760]  one woman fighter as a threat. And they just can't defeat us if we take action. It's over.
[1:18:13.760 --> 1:18:17.800]  They're deterred. Yeah. One thing that we found like with Acorn, Acorn rebranded itself.
[1:18:17.800 --> 1:18:21.720]  Our audience knows that Acorn was shut down. President Obama signed legislation to defund
[1:18:21.720 --> 1:18:27.640]  Acorn six years ago after our expose. Acorn has turned into a bunch of subgroups like
[1:18:27.640 --> 1:18:32.200]  organizing for America. And a lot of these groups are scared. They're petrified that
[1:18:32.200 --> 1:18:37.320]  there are going to be people like us going in there with cameras exposing it. And they're
[1:18:37.320 --> 1:18:42.000]  ultimately deterred. They're deterred from doing the fraud. But what happens is they
[1:18:42.000 --> 1:18:47.040]  take the fraud and they go behind closed doors. It makes it tougher to uncover. So we actually,
[1:18:47.040 --> 1:18:53.040]  Veritas, we have to increase our sophistication. And Alex, I want to come on your show in January
[1:18:53.040 --> 1:18:59.400]  because we have a huge story coming out about the topic is, is education in the country.
[1:18:59.400 --> 1:19:04.320]  And it's a topic that your audience is going to want to hear about. We had to, we had to
[1:19:04.320 --> 1:19:09.120]  build online aliases. We had to go way behind closed doors, build relationships with a lot
[1:19:09.120 --> 1:19:13.200]  of these federal officials over months. This is what we have to do to expose them because
[1:19:13.200 --> 1:19:17.960]  they take their fraud deeper and deeper and deeper. They don't do it in the open anymore.
[1:19:17.960 --> 1:19:19.600]  So we got to go behind closed doors.
[1:19:19.600 --> 1:19:24.080]  Well, you are using intelligence agency tactics when you use good looking women and stuff
[1:19:24.080 --> 1:19:27.400]  and you got people pulling their wedding rings off and spilling their guts. I mean, you're
[1:19:27.400 --> 1:19:31.040]  doing some stuff that, you know, they would use against them, you know, the mob or whatever
[1:19:31.040 --> 1:19:38.320]  or the CIA would use. I really got to hand it to you. Just the innovation of the boldness.
[1:19:38.320 --> 1:19:43.040]  But I guess, let me guess, as they've persecuted you more and you just become more successful
[1:19:43.040 --> 1:19:47.760]  has that made you more aggressive? Are there, there are attempts at intimidation?
[1:19:47.760 --> 1:19:51.360]  I think it's just made us smarter. You know, they say, what doesn't jail you makes you
[1:19:51.360 --> 1:19:55.480]  smarter? But, but I do really believe in the deaths, you know, that, you know, you say
[1:19:55.480 --> 1:19:59.720]  the X wing, the death star analogy, like Eric Holder, you know, we got offered Eric Holder's
[1:19:59.720 --> 1:20:05.280]  ballot because there's no photo ID, so you can get offered ballots. And after that happened,
[1:20:05.280 --> 1:20:10.080]  Holder did not come after us instead. He kind of backed off. So I think applying the tactics
[1:20:10.080 --> 1:20:14.960]  of Saul Lidsky, personalizing the target, learning from intelligence agencies, we actually
[1:20:14.960 --> 1:20:21.240]  hired a former, a former CIA case officer to teach us about what the tactics that they
[1:20:21.240 --> 1:20:27.360]  do and learning these techniques and using them to investigate and expose fraud. I think
[1:20:27.360 --> 1:20:30.080]  it's made us bolder. I think it's made us learn more.
[1:20:30.080 --> 1:20:34.000]  Yes. See, I didn't know that you'd been trained by former CIA, but that's clear. What you
[1:20:34.000 --> 1:20:38.080]  guys are doing is really aggressive. And it is the model folks. Everybody's got to get
[1:20:38.080 --> 1:20:43.040]  your book that breaks all this down. I mean, I've told my crew this, we need to do this
[1:20:43.040 --> 1:20:48.560]  as well. I've kind of not cracked the whip because it's such a sophisticated thing you're
[1:20:48.560 --> 1:20:51.960]  doing. But overall, it's just about doing it. You get better and better. Let's shift
[1:20:51.960 --> 1:20:55.520]  gears, we'll get to your final story and let you go here in about five minutes. Let's talk
[1:20:55.520 --> 1:21:00.520]  about again, James O'Keefe, project veritas.com joining us, breaking one of the biggest stories
[1:21:00.520 --> 1:21:04.960]  ever early next year. He says he'll join us as soon as that comes out. What about the
[1:21:04.960 --> 1:21:09.480]  culture war? I mean, we know so many prominent Hollywood people who've been silent their
[1:21:09.480 --> 1:21:15.440]  whole lives like Kurt Russell this week, coming out and saying, I'm pro-guine and here's why,
[1:21:15.440 --> 1:21:21.280]  so eloquently. I don't know what the system is going to do as everybody really turns on
[1:21:21.280 --> 1:21:25.960]  political correctness. I mean, even South Park is this has got to be really, really
[1:21:25.960 --> 1:21:31.520]  worrying them. Well, I mean, one of the things that in terms of the culture wars, the good
[1:21:31.520 --> 1:21:36.240]  wife on CBS, I don't know if people watch that show, but it's all the investigations
[1:21:36.240 --> 1:21:42.640]  I do. They mentioned our work about two weeks ago on the good wife, CBS, the screenwriter.
[1:21:42.640 --> 1:21:48.400]  They said they did a whole show about undercover videos on Planned Parenthood and abortion
[1:21:48.400 --> 1:21:52.680]  things and they brought my name up and said, this is disgusting. This is like James O'Keefe.
[1:21:52.680 --> 1:21:57.440]  I must have gotten 200 text messages in the course of two minutes. People I've never even
[1:21:57.440 --> 1:22:02.120]  talked to in years, suddenly paying attention. So we've got to somehow take our work and
[1:22:02.120 --> 1:22:05.800]  make it mainstream. We've got to force people to pay attention to what we do. Now on the
[1:22:05.800 --> 1:22:09.800]  subject of guns, now what we did, and this is something that we're going to continue
[1:22:09.800 --> 1:22:14.680]  doing, I think it's very important, the attorney general of Maryland, we went undercover and
[1:22:14.680 --> 1:22:18.640]  we met this guy. Yes, he took his wedding ring off. This guy's married. He was supposed
[1:22:18.640 --> 1:22:24.400]  to be a taxpayer funded conference. He tries to, he starts hitting on my female undercover
[1:22:24.400 --> 1:22:28.680]  reporter and divulging all this information and saying, now here's the truth. I really
[1:22:28.680 --> 1:22:33.720]  want to ban all guns. I want to ban all guns. I don't want you to tell anybody I said that.
[1:22:33.720 --> 1:22:38.320]  I want that to be off the record. This is the deputy attorney general of Maryland saying
[1:22:38.320 --> 1:22:43.520]  this. So I'm going to continue to do that. Usually I don't say this publicly, but I'm
[1:22:43.520 --> 1:22:48.480]  going to try to catch all these officials in all these states. What exactly do they
[1:22:48.480 --> 1:22:52.960]  intend to do about the second amendment? And for some reason, I don't know why they don't
[1:22:52.960 --> 1:22:57.120]  shoot a shot from the rooftops. If they want to ban all guns, let's hear it. That's one
[1:22:57.120 --> 1:23:00.640]  of the things that I'm going to be doing. That's what we did in Maryland. Got this guy
[1:23:00.640 --> 1:23:05.280]  in hot water. He takes off his wedding ring. He starts hitting on our undercover reporter,
[1:23:05.280 --> 1:23:09.920]  telling her exactly what he intends to do with your gun rights in the state of Maryland.
[1:23:09.920 --> 1:23:13.560]  And that's how you pick up Democrat, weirdo, socialist women who he thought she was. As
[1:23:13.560 --> 1:23:17.000]  you tell them, I want to destroy America. I want the guns. I'm a tyrant. I'm filth. They
[1:23:17.000 --> 1:23:21.720]  just go, oh my gosh, let's go. But sadly enough, that's not who they were dealing with. After
[1:23:21.720 --> 1:23:26.200]  you're gone, I'm going to come back and play a clip of that video. Maryland Attorney General's
[1:23:26.200 --> 1:23:32.920]  office sex guns and egregious ethical violations. Just one of the latest bombshell videos that
[1:23:32.920 --> 1:23:37.880]  you released just last week. Now, speaking of, you go after Acron, they're getting three
[1:23:37.880 --> 1:23:42.040]  to five billion a year. You're going to multiple offices where they're like, you got underage
[1:23:42.040 --> 1:23:48.840]  prostitutes. No big deal. I mean, just showing the incredible seediness and mafioso behavior
[1:23:48.840 --> 1:23:53.960]  of these organizations. But as you said, they then just break into battleground Texas and
[1:23:53.960 --> 1:23:58.680]  metastasize. Speaking of Kurt Russell, it reminds me of the thing where you chop off
[1:23:58.680 --> 1:24:04.880]  one part of it and it just grows tentacles and ends up running away. Now still that ends
[1:24:04.880 --> 1:24:10.960]  up hurting it. But how do you track down every piece of it? How does Kurt Russell take this
[1:24:10.960 --> 1:24:14.880]  out and flamethrow it? How do we deal with this, James O'Keeffe?
[1:24:14.880 --> 1:24:20.520]  I haven't seen that one in a couple of years. I think that the price of liberty...
[1:24:20.520 --> 1:24:24.080]  Oh, that's Hillary on screen. Sorry, go ahead. We're showing some of Hillary on the campaign
[1:24:24.080 --> 1:24:28.400]  trial right now. Sorry, sir. Go ahead. Kurt Russell's dealing with it.
[1:24:28.400 --> 1:24:32.880]  I think the price of liberty, Alex, is eternal vigilance. A lot of people I speak with think,
[1:24:32.880 --> 1:24:37.880]  James, you know, they're just going to metamorphose into something else or going to change into
[1:24:37.880 --> 1:24:43.160]  something else. Look, you got to keep going. If something is effective, if something takes
[1:24:43.160 --> 1:24:49.200]  an organization down or exposes the truth, you got to keep exposing it. Acorn is going
[1:24:49.200 --> 1:24:53.160]  to turn into different subgroups. They've lost their federal funding. And if we catch
[1:24:53.160 --> 1:24:57.920]  one government official and they lose their job, which is what's going to happen in January
[1:24:57.920 --> 1:25:03.400]  again, we call them scouts, if we can get one person to lose their job, then we need
[1:25:03.400 --> 1:25:08.200]  to do that a hundred times. And I guarantee you that after the hundred person loses their
[1:25:08.200 --> 1:25:16.000]  job, maybe our people in Congress, maybe our people in Congress, maybe our people in Congress
[1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:21.160]  take the system and reform the system instead of firing every federal workforce. And that's
[1:25:21.160 --> 1:25:26.320]  my goal. Just get as many as possible on tape until they actually reform the system.
[1:25:26.320 --> 1:25:29.800]  I agree with you. Then we have to hunt down every piece of it and then prosecute them for
[1:25:29.800 --> 1:25:34.080]  the crimes they've committed. So, I mean, isn't local government states taking action?
[1:25:34.080 --> 1:25:38.560]  Think that our current Russell on the ground with the flamethrower? Alex, I don't believe
[1:25:38.560 --> 1:25:42.720]  that our current court system or our current political leadership is going to solve the
[1:25:42.720 --> 1:25:47.120]  problems our country faces. I think this is a movement driven thing. I think it's a people
[1:25:47.120 --> 1:25:53.960]  driven thing. It's a bottom up thing. I do not look to courts or to Congress to actually
[1:25:53.960 --> 1:25:58.840]  solve the problem. You got to outrage the people that's happening right now in our politics.
[1:25:58.840 --> 1:26:02.560]  It's happening with with some of the support that Donald Trump and Ted Cruz is people are
[1:26:02.560 --> 1:26:08.240]  very frustrated. So, I think we got to feed people information, allow them to be outraged
[1:26:08.240 --> 1:26:14.000]  about what's happening. And if the groups change and they turn into a different, I'm
[1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:19.360]  laughing at what you have on the screen there. If they turn into different alien forms and
[1:26:19.360 --> 1:26:23.120]  the organizing for America and snake heads, just keep going after them.
[1:26:23.120 --> 1:26:28.800]  Well, that's what you do. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, Kurt Russell knows how to take them out.
[1:26:28.800 --> 1:26:35.560]  We can learn a few things from the CIA and Kurt Russell. I encourage your audience. I
[1:26:35.560 --> 1:26:40.320]  know that we don't like Saul Linsky and we don't like some of the CIA tactics. We should
[1:26:40.320 --> 1:26:45.560]  also learn from some of the things they do. Well, real days, the CIA used this against
[1:26:45.560 --> 1:26:49.680]  mass murdering communists and it's all very fair of its applied right. It's the new stuff
[1:26:49.680 --> 1:26:54.080]  that's dirty, funding ISIS and stuff, proxy wars. It's good to legally and lawfully be
[1:26:54.080 --> 1:26:59.160]  an investigative journalist, infiltrate, use sex operatives as long as they're not offering
[1:26:59.160 --> 1:27:03.520]  sex for info and just let these guys spill their guts. These are enemies of the Republic
[1:27:03.520 --> 1:27:09.240]  in my view and we got to take the gloves off. We are at war. We are at war and we don't
[1:27:09.240 --> 1:27:13.520]  take prisoners. Now, we're journalists, so we're not funding ISIS and doing some of
[1:27:13.520 --> 1:27:20.280]  the dirty things you mentioned, but this is a war for the sake of our country and that's
[1:27:20.280 --> 1:27:24.680]  why I'm building what I'm building. I'm building stuff I can't even talk to you about, but
[1:27:24.680 --> 1:27:28.440]  I am very excited to come on your program in January. I want you to be one of the first
[1:27:28.440 --> 1:27:33.600]  people to have this story about our education system, our federal education system. It's
[1:27:33.600 --> 1:27:40.320]  going to be bombshell and I just encourage everyone to have hope and to know that things
[1:27:40.320 --> 1:27:44.320]  are turning around and just be part of this movement for accountability.
[1:27:44.320 --> 1:27:47.560]  And by the way, I'd have you on five, six years ago and you weren't as positive. I mean,
[1:27:47.560 --> 1:27:51.720]  I wasn't as positive and there's a lot of bad stuff happening, but at the same time,
[1:27:51.720 --> 1:27:55.000]  people are really waking up. It's not that they're even conservative. I mean, I'm a libertarian.
[1:27:55.000 --> 1:28:00.160]  We just really realized, man, the Democrats rotted into something really scary that's
[1:28:00.160 --> 1:28:05.400]  metastasizing and they're really out to destroy the two-party system and really take over
[1:28:05.400 --> 1:28:09.440]  and they're working with a bunch of neocons and rhinos and it's time to take the gloves
[1:28:09.440 --> 1:28:16.160]  off and you and your book and project veritas.com in my view, James O'Keefe, again, is the model,
[1:28:16.160 --> 1:28:20.560]  the cutting edge of how to counter these people and in closing, I mean, when I see stuff like
[1:28:20.560 --> 1:28:25.600]  these folks infiltrating the abortion clinics and others and then I talk to these folks,
[1:28:25.600 --> 1:28:29.400]  they are using you and in our model, but especially you and others as the way to do
[1:28:29.400 --> 1:28:33.920]  it. And I know those are just more X-wings out there to attack the Death Star. It's
[1:28:33.920 --> 1:28:38.960]  got to give you a good feeling to know that we're all in this together. More people are
[1:28:38.960 --> 1:28:42.360]  coming to the floor and that means it makes us even harder to beat.
[1:28:42.360 --> 1:28:47.240]  Yeah. I mean, David DeLyden, who did the story on Center for Medical Progress, I met
[1:28:47.240 --> 1:28:53.080]  him a couple of years ago in Sacramento and I mean, it took him, by the way, three years
[1:28:53.080 --> 1:28:59.360]  of commitment to infiltrate Planned Parenthood and expose what was happening with the selling
[1:28:59.360 --> 1:29:03.960]  fetal tissue. That's a lot of commitment, three years on one issue and that's what
[1:29:03.960 --> 1:29:08.720]  it's going to take. It's going to take a couple brave people and if federal officials, if
[1:29:08.720 --> 1:29:12.840]  government officials are lying, stealing, cheating from the taxpayer, we will make you
[1:29:12.840 --> 1:29:16.640]  an unwilling internet sensation. We will make you famous.
[1:29:16.640 --> 1:29:22.560]  Well done. Well done. Well, projectveritas.com James O'Keefe, you're awesome. Have a wonderful
[1:29:22.560 --> 1:29:25.800]  Christmas and we look forward to in a few weeks when you break the bombshell to have
[1:29:25.800 --> 1:29:27.480]  you back with us. Thank you, sir.
[1:29:27.480 --> 1:29:28.480]  Thank you.
[1:29:28.480 --> 1:29:33.520]  Folks, put us back on screen for TV viewers if we can. It's available at projectveritas.com

[1:29:48.280 --> 1:29:59.120]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:29:59.120 --> 1:30:04.600]  The LAPD and private security are targeting random people with stop and frisk searches
[1:30:04.600 --> 1:30:09.080]  on public sidewalks before the premiere of Star Wars, The Force Awakens. Police have
[1:30:09.080 --> 1:30:15.120]  also installed metal detectors on the sidewalks near the famous TCL Chinese Theater in Hollywood,
[1:30:15.120 --> 1:30:20.040]  California. Someone took to Twitter to post a picture of a Wookiee having his bag searched.
[1:30:20.040 --> 1:30:24.360]  The caption reads, security will be tight for the latest hashtag Star Wars premiere
[1:30:24.360 --> 1:30:31.280]  tonight. Metal detectors have been set up. TMZ reported, LAPD and private security officers
[1:30:31.280 --> 1:30:35.640]  are already blanketing several square blocks around the famed Chinese Theater where the
[1:30:35.640 --> 1:30:40.760]  Force Awakens event is going down. We've learned anyone strolling through the area could be
[1:30:40.760 --> 1:30:46.040]  searched, frisked and even wandered with metal detectors. In other words, even people not
[1:30:46.040 --> 1:30:51.240]  associated with the event who are simply passing through a public area are subject to a warrantless
[1:30:51.240 --> 1:31:02.320]  search. You can find more reports on infowars.com.

[1:32:56.440 --> 1:33:16.440]  12. You want answers? Well, so does he. Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex
[1:33:16.440 --> 1:33:35.440]  Gessler. In award votes, loveless main business, target maximum firepower. We've reached the
[1:33:35.440 --> 1:33:51.680]  loveless CNN show. Bye-bye. I'm afraid your new world order is going too well.
[1:33:51.680 --> 1:33:55.980]  Gotta love it, ladies and gentlemen. Another one of the great intros the crew has put together
[1:33:55.980 --> 1:34:02.160]  with all the Star Wars fever hitting, but it comes out Friday. I need to hijack some
[1:34:02.160 --> 1:34:05.360]  of the Star Wars propaganda. I haven't done that yet. I've been so busy fighting the new
[1:34:05.360 --> 1:34:10.760]  world order, but I'd say 75, 80% of the war is in entertainment. That's where the real
[1:34:10.760 --> 1:34:15.960]  brainwashing is going on. And so, Jakari Jackson and Kit Daniels didn't get tickets
[1:34:15.960 --> 1:34:21.000]  for the first day. They will have a report, but I want to send one of our professional
[1:34:21.000 --> 1:34:25.080]  camera people out to help them. They work so hard, they'll go shoot themselves, and
[1:34:25.080 --> 1:34:28.880]  Jakari's a pretty good camera guy, so we should send somebody out with them so they can shoot
[1:34:28.880 --> 1:34:34.480]  at HD when they come out and really, you know, do a great job and maybe talk to some of the
[1:34:34.480 --> 1:34:38.280]  folks on the street about what they thought about it. Do a whole production because, you
[1:34:38.280 --> 1:34:43.240]  know, a first review, M4's first review of it will be the kind of video that gets a million
[1:34:43.240 --> 1:34:48.400]  views. And we think about that. It's like mainstream media to get a million views will
[1:34:48.400 --> 1:34:55.480]  have like a $50,000 budget. The budgets on the Ventura TV show were like, you know, $500,
[1:34:55.480 --> 1:35:02.480]  $600, $700,000 a piece. Other shows, I've been on Discovery Channel shows with $3 million
[1:35:02.480 --> 1:35:09.360]  to $4 million price tags per episode. Five of them were shot with me as the main guy.
[1:35:09.360 --> 1:35:15.080]  It didn't make me look bad with an award-winning director, but Joe Bellinger, now the guy that
[1:35:15.080 --> 1:35:19.600]  made some kind of monster and brother's keeper and, you know, he's won like Academy Awards
[1:35:19.600 --> 1:35:24.840]  and stuff. I think it's heading for your brother's keeper. And he just said, no, Alex, I'm your
[1:35:24.840 --> 1:35:28.480]  goofy. You do some weird stuff, but I actually like you and I didn't make you look bad. And
[1:35:28.480 --> 1:35:33.800]  will you come back and look stupid? And I said, I've never done that before, but you're
[1:35:33.800 --> 1:35:37.320]  so nice. I'm not going to do anything fake. But how about we bring in some people that
[1:35:37.320 --> 1:35:40.040]  attacked me to make it quote more fair? And he goes, I already did that. He goes, you
[1:35:40.040 --> 1:35:43.760]  know what? He called back a day later and he goes, you were nice to say you might debate
[1:35:43.760 --> 1:35:48.240]  some enemies or something, but I'm not going to violate my integrity or your integrity.
[1:35:48.240 --> 1:35:56.200]  So I'm not going to re-edit it. And they just shelved. I think he said it. I think it was
[1:35:56.200 --> 1:36:14.800]  over $16 million in production. 16 mil. Never seen. 16 mil. Never seen. How's that? That's
[1:36:14.800 --> 1:36:20.800]  how big the control is, boys and girls. And then many other examples of where I've been
[1:36:20.800 --> 1:36:24.920]  in LA. I've been out there, except for this year and a couple of years, because I mean,
[1:36:24.920 --> 1:36:30.880]  I used to go out there, A and E, just discovery channel, history channel, you name it, I've
[1:36:30.880 --> 1:36:39.960]  met with them all. And they wanted me to act like a clown on my own reality TV show and
[1:36:39.960 --> 1:36:44.720]  have all this fake infighting and all this garbage. Even before Duck Dynasty was around,
[1:36:44.720 --> 1:36:49.000]  they wanted basically show like that. I was pitched and then you'll go out to your family
[1:36:49.000 --> 1:36:53.080]  ranch and then drink and then shoot guns and act like a hillbilly. And then you'll come
[1:36:53.080 --> 1:36:56.520]  back to your office and argue with people. And I just said, you know what? I don't want
[1:36:56.520 --> 1:36:59.440]  to do it. And then they come back and go, okay, we weren't offering you any money at
[1:36:59.440 --> 1:37:05.720]  first, but we would make you famous and then there'd be merchandise. Do you want a million
[1:37:05.720 --> 1:37:11.720]  dollars? And I'd say, no, a million dollars. You don't want a million dollars. No, I don't
[1:37:11.720 --> 1:37:17.920]  want your million dollars. Go roll it up, put some tobacco in it and smoke it. And now
[1:37:17.920 --> 1:37:22.960]  I'm going to respond to it. I used to get every week reality TV show offers and then
[1:37:22.960 --> 1:37:28.720]  many times on paper with contracts. In fact, I was offered other famous people's TV shows
[1:37:28.720 --> 1:37:32.800]  basically when they didn't want to do them anymore. And I didn't do it because the direction
[1:37:32.800 --> 1:37:36.160]  things were going, I mean, Chewbacobras do the rest of it. And I'm not knocking folks
[1:37:36.160 --> 1:37:40.880]  that do that. It's just that ain't me. See, I admire folks like George Norrie because
[1:37:40.880 --> 1:37:44.040]  he took a show that was all space aliens and Chewbacobras and made it more about the new
[1:37:44.040 --> 1:37:48.560]  world order. He reformed coast to coast about 80%. And I don't blame him for keeping some
[1:37:48.560 --> 1:37:53.160]  of the fun stuff in there. That's why his show is pretty much number two or number one.
[1:37:53.160 --> 1:37:59.160]  600 radio stations in Austin, Texas, his show, every book that comes out, every rating series
[1:37:59.160 --> 1:38:06.200]  that we see in the news has upwards of 65% of the total radio terrestrial audience in
[1:38:06.200 --> 1:38:13.480]  Austin. And it's like that all across the country, 50 to 60%. Some places, I mean, AM,
[1:38:13.480 --> 1:38:20.600]  FM, everything, he'll have 60% of them tuning in or more. That's not selling out. He came
[1:38:20.600 --> 1:38:26.320]  in, took the show over, made it better, made it bigger, covered a lot of real hardcore topics.
[1:38:26.320 --> 1:38:33.920]  What mainstream TVs wanted me to do is go do shows where I cover, you know, ghost and
[1:38:33.920 --> 1:38:39.800]  goblins and vampires most of the time and then mix it in with his heart controlling vampires
[1:38:39.800 --> 1:38:45.600]  or, you know, are there underground cities under New York with aliens in them? And then
[1:38:45.600 --> 1:38:49.760]  Rachel Maddow comes out when I've never done those shows and says that I believe there
[1:38:49.760 --> 1:38:55.280]  are giant aliens under the U.N. building. I know for a fact that they brought Donald
[1:38:55.280 --> 1:39:00.640]  Trump news articles and said, look what you did going on his show. And Trump looked at
[1:39:00.640 --> 1:39:06.720]  it and said, there's no clip or quote here. Well, they just make it up like they do me.
[1:39:06.720 --> 1:39:11.040]  Decision was made. I went on a show. I'm gonna know all that went on. I'm just gonna stop
[1:39:11.040 --> 1:39:15.920]  right there. See, Trump's smart folks. He says, give 5 million to the vets. They say
[1:39:15.920 --> 1:39:22.000]  he wants 5 million for himself. They lie. They twist. They deceive. They think we're idiots.
[1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:26.080]  And so when I tell you about my personal experiences, it's not bragging that I've been offered
[1:39:26.080 --> 1:39:34.960]  all these TV shows. It's not bragging about all this. It's that I have witnessed it.
[1:39:34.960 --> 1:39:43.760]  I have seen it with my own eyeballs. I've seen major directors spend eight months on
[1:39:43.760 --> 1:39:49.760]  producing a five part TV show with the highest budget ever for Discovery Channel and they
[1:39:49.760 --> 1:39:54.560]  just killed it. And I've sat in the meetings where they go six, seven years ago. The hottest
[1:39:54.560 --> 1:39:58.960]  thing is gun shows. And we're pitching nothing but gun shows on History Discovery Unit because
[1:39:58.960 --> 1:40:02.160]  a lot of these are production companies that do it for everybody else, you know, to make it.
[1:40:03.520 --> 1:40:07.600]  And they go, Alex, we want you to have several gun shows. Alex, we want
[1:40:10.160 --> 1:40:14.000]  you to bring us people for gun shows. And then they call back and go, no, you're right.
[1:40:14.000 --> 1:40:17.680]  There's an order to kill all the gun shows. And the next season you're going to see almost all
[1:40:17.680 --> 1:40:20.480]  the shows canceled. And you saw that happen three years ago.
[1:40:20.480 --> 1:40:27.600]  You know, they had that whole hit piece on Jesse James, who I happened to know pretty well. He
[1:40:27.600 --> 1:40:30.960]  lives here in Austin, Texas. And I can find no fault with him. He's a really nice guy,
[1:40:30.960 --> 1:40:34.560]  Pro Second Amendment. A lot of that Sandra Bullock stuff pretty much wasn't even
[1:40:34.560 --> 1:40:38.320]  true and was just a stunt for her movie. And he's never attacked Sandra Bullock to me. I just
[1:40:38.320 --> 1:40:41.760]  know the inside baseball from Hollywood. Then I met him, got to know him. He used to live
[1:40:41.760 --> 1:40:46.000]  next door to me or I did. I don't live there anymore and just got to know him.
[1:40:46.000 --> 1:40:52.640]  And I'll leave it at that. I'll just leave it at that. And he's certainly not perfect,
[1:40:52.640 --> 1:40:58.320]  nobody is, but he's grown up a lot. So have I. And just some of the inside baseball stuff he
[1:40:58.320 --> 1:41:02.720]  was telling me about a lot of what they did to him in the media is because he's more libertarian
[1:41:02.720 --> 1:41:06.880]  or conservative. And that's just what they do, folks. They take little things that are true
[1:41:06.880 --> 1:41:12.480]  and they twist them and they exaggerate them and they expand them. Jesse James is a nice guy.
[1:41:12.480 --> 1:41:17.840]  Lance Armstrong is a total jerk. And so, you know, those are just the dichotomies that I
[1:41:17.840 --> 1:41:24.400]  personally have experienced myself. So if you've experienced, you know, people always demonize me
[1:41:24.400 --> 1:41:29.280]  to my friends. I'm good friends with a prominent old Texas family, the Steiners. And, you know,
[1:41:29.280 --> 1:41:32.960]  they're all part of the Johnson family. You name it as well, but they're really good friends. And,
[1:41:32.960 --> 1:41:36.160]  you know, sometimes people politicians come over to their house for dinner, will bash me.
[1:41:36.720 --> 1:41:40.720]  And then Bobby Steiner will say, do you know Alex Jones? Because I've known him since he was
[1:41:40.720 --> 1:41:46.240]  in high school, my boys. That's not the Alex Jones I know. See, it's about knowing somebody
[1:41:46.240 --> 1:41:51.280]  or actually seeing them do it. I didn't say there's wasp under the Capitol or under the
[1:41:51.280 --> 1:41:55.120]  U.N. building. I didn't say there wasn't a moon landing. I didn't say George Bush put bombs in
[1:41:55.120 --> 1:41:59.120]  the buildings. I said there were bombs in building seven. And I interviewed the emergency manager
[1:41:59.120 --> 1:42:05.040]  who they killed two weeks later. Barry Jennings murdered him after he's on my show. That's real.
[1:42:05.840 --> 1:42:09.440]  I don't know who did it. I don't know exactly what's going on. But let me tell you,
[1:42:09.440 --> 1:42:15.360]  we're getting lied to folks and our government's funding the very same Al Qaeda trash to go kill
[1:42:15.360 --> 1:42:19.680]  moderate Christian nations and others and then bringing them here. And that's crazy.
[1:42:23.680 --> 1:42:27.680]  And it's just refreshing. And I'm not saying Trump's perfect and he might go down the road
[1:42:27.680 --> 1:42:30.400]  and not like me or something. I don't care. It's not about who Donald Trump likes me.
[1:42:31.120 --> 1:42:38.000]  It's that it's refreshing that he was told by a bunch of his people, do not go on the Alex Jones
[1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:44.880]  show. And he did because Donald Trump runs Donald Trump and I've seen it for myself firsthand.
[1:42:45.680 --> 1:42:51.760]  I've experienced it. And in a nation of cowards and a nation of people that bend over to the wind
[1:42:52.560 --> 1:42:57.200]  in a nation of people that just go along to get along or easily intimidated, it is a very
[1:42:57.200 --> 1:43:03.200]  refreshing to see his confidence. And he's not arrogant. He is extremely confident.
[1:43:03.200 --> 1:43:10.640]  He's committed. And he's done a lot of things that I'm sure he wish he would have done differently.
[1:43:10.640 --> 1:43:16.080]  And he may end up betraying us. I don't know. All I know is he's in the arena being attacked
[1:43:16.080 --> 1:43:20.800]  by all this scum and I'm not standing against Donald Trump. It's that simple. I'm going to watch
[1:43:20.800 --> 1:43:24.320]  it. I'm going to see and I'm going to do what I always do. I'm going to tell you what the fact
[1:43:24.320 --> 1:43:33.440]  show and what my gut tells me. And my gut tells me that they might kill Donald Trump.
[1:43:35.200 --> 1:43:41.040]  That's what my gut tells me. When I saw Jeff Bush repeatedly saying you will not be president,
[1:43:41.040 --> 1:43:46.400]  one time he said it was just such hate. And his eyes fired up and you saw the real Jeff Bush.
[1:43:46.400 --> 1:43:50.480]  That's a scary guy right there. You know why bad mouth the Bush is so bad and run them down. I mean
[1:43:50.480 --> 1:43:56.480]  Bush, W is not even that bad from my intel. It's the other ones. That's why it was such a big joke
[1:43:56.480 --> 1:44:03.520]  that the first born dud as his dad sees him ended up being the president. Marvin and Jeb and all of
[1:44:03.520 --> 1:44:09.360]  them. I mean, you talk about a pack of wolves. You talk about a pack of dangerous men. They're it,
[1:44:09.360 --> 1:44:17.920]  baby. Third generation Nazi collaborators. Now fourth generation. And folks, the media always
[1:44:17.920 --> 1:44:26.880]  misconstrues. I'm not saying we face a Nazi conspiracy. The Nazis looted Europe, Northern,
[1:44:28.320 --> 1:44:38.320]  Western, Southern, Central and Russia. They looted the Middle East and North Africa. The Russians
[1:44:39.360 --> 1:44:44.000]  never got back but a small percentage of it. It got handed over to the West in a deal to get
[1:44:44.000 --> 1:44:49.840]  the Nazis out to the United States. And that's all come out. But see, I was told about this
[1:44:49.840 --> 1:44:55.280]  when I was a child because I had family in Texas that witnessed it and I'm going to leave it right
[1:44:55.280 --> 1:45:00.640]  there. But let me tell you something, ladies and gentlemen, there's a lot of rabbit holes around
[1:45:00.640 --> 1:45:06.800]  here and what you think's going on in what's going on. When you see the Bushes, their wealth is
[1:45:06.800 --> 1:45:12.960]  reportedly in the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of billions. It may even
[1:45:12.960 --> 1:45:22.160]  be over a trillion. They're one of the richest families in the world as the managers of rat holes,
[1:45:23.120 --> 1:45:30.560]  of just caves of gold and diamonds and rubies and paintings and technology and
[1:45:31.520 --> 1:45:34.480]  networks. They took over the whole Nazi network that was worldwide.
[1:45:36.080 --> 1:45:41.600]  Because skull and bones should have. You don't just think that the Bushes got let in to run the
[1:45:41.600 --> 1:45:46.080]  Nazi operation and the thirties and tried to overthrow the president. I mean, it's all in the
[1:45:46.080 --> 1:45:51.840]  Cormac-Dickstein committee hearings. You don't just think they were just let into this for a reason.
[1:45:51.840 --> 1:46:01.840]  In 1832, wealthy American sons of tycoons, three of them, were sent to Germany to go to college.
[1:46:03.120 --> 1:46:10.240]  The Russell Trust and others came back and set up skull and bones temple number 322. And they admit
[1:46:10.240 --> 1:46:14.880]  it. They've been broken into. It's come out. Members of its families have gone public. Charlotte
[1:46:14.880 --> 1:46:18.880]  Isabel's dad was a member. She leaked it all to Anthony Sutton, the congressional investigation,
[1:46:20.480 --> 1:46:24.640]  that it is an Illuminati German death cult that worships Lucifer.
[1:46:28.720 --> 1:46:36.720]  Period. Period. And that's why the Germans came over. They were an extension of that. A death
[1:46:36.720 --> 1:46:41.840]  cult, you know, black uniforms, skull and crossbones on their hats. And that's why they worked with
[1:46:41.840 --> 1:46:50.640]  Prescott. Skull and bones, baby. Skull and bones. They don't play games. They mean business.
[1:46:52.800 --> 1:46:56.800]  But Smedley Butler, two-time congressional medal honor winner, he'd been pretty right-wing.
[1:46:57.520 --> 1:47:00.720]  And they came to him and he'd overthrown more than seven countries himself.
[1:47:01.760 --> 1:47:05.520]  They came to him and they said, we want you to overthrow the U.S. government. We got a 500,000
[1:47:05.520 --> 1:47:11.520]  man army right now. We've got more than 15 governors ready to go. And he went and reported the whole
[1:47:11.520 --> 1:47:16.000]  thing to the federal government and the FBI and the rest of them who were infiltrated themselves.
[1:47:16.000 --> 1:47:21.280]  There was an internal battle. Some folks got killed behind the scenes. They came to the bushes and
[1:47:21.280 --> 1:47:26.320]  they said, you're too big to bring down with all this. You're going to flip as double agents and
[1:47:26.320 --> 1:47:31.600]  give us everything the Germans have got. This is in 1937. You're going to keep playing ball.
[1:47:31.600 --> 1:47:36.240]  The Kennedys got rolled by the Nazis. They got put on the payroll too. They told Jack Kennedy.
[1:47:36.240 --> 1:47:44.560]  They told RFK. They told Daddy Kennedy. They told the oldest son, Joe Jr., who blew up
[1:47:44.560 --> 1:47:49.120]  piloting drones. They'd have a plane behind them with the drones below. He got blown up by the
[1:47:49.120 --> 1:47:54.400]  Germans. There was a group of Messerschmitts if you look it up. And they said, you're going to set
[1:47:54.400 --> 1:47:58.960]  up the Germans. This is great. So they didn't make a big thing about it till the end of World War
[1:47:58.960 --> 1:48:05.280]  II so they could do a double infiltration of the Nazis. But then the bushes got all those goodies
[1:48:05.280 --> 1:48:09.760]  for themselves. So Trump needs to get into all this. And we're going to air on the nightly news
[1:48:09.760 --> 1:48:15.200]  tonight an excerpt of a film I made, Marshall Law on the subject, but update it. I'm going to do a
[1:48:15.200 --> 1:48:22.480]  Facebook mentions after the show today as well where I go over all of this for folks. Just so you
[1:48:22.480 --> 1:48:29.040]  understand what we're really dealing with here instead of being a bunch of morons. But when you
[1:48:29.040 --> 1:48:41.440]  look at Jeb Bush, you're talking super evil. Super evil. And he thinks that they're not going to
[1:48:41.440 --> 1:48:49.440]  let Trump win. He thinks they're going to steal the delegates and have a broker convention.
[1:48:49.440 --> 1:48:54.320]  And I think it's up to us to decide whether that's going to happen or not. When we come back,
[1:48:54.320 --> 1:48:57.280]  I want to play a clip of this. Maryland Attorney General's office, sex, guns and
[1:48:57.280 --> 1:49:00.240]  egregious ethical violations we talked about with O'Keefe earlier.
[1:49:02.640 --> 1:49:08.480]  Before we go to break, I've completely committed. Many days I'm exhausted up here on air and I
[1:49:08.480 --> 1:49:14.000]  just get angry and bull through it like I'm doing right now. And it's spiritually at a gut level,
[1:49:14.000 --> 1:49:18.480]  not fun to mess with these people. You know, my base instincts, my animal instincts,
[1:49:18.480 --> 1:49:22.880]  my worldly instincts, my fleshly instincts saying, Hey man, don't mess with these people.
[1:49:22.880 --> 1:49:25.200]  But my spirit says you're going to do it. You're going to go all the way.
[1:49:26.880 --> 1:49:31.120]  So I want to be clear. My spirit's not afraid at all. My flesh is. But you know what?
[1:49:31.840 --> 1:49:37.440]  There's a reason flesh is weak and the spirit's strong and unbreakable. Because my spirit,
[1:49:37.440 --> 1:49:43.200]  before it was put in my mother's gut and in my body, was forged by the creator of the universe.
[1:49:43.200 --> 1:49:46.240]  And so was yours. You know, decide which side you're going to join. You're going to let the
[1:49:46.240 --> 1:49:51.600]  flesh scare you and adjoin in the devil. Because once you realize it's just flesh, it's going to
[1:49:51.600 --> 1:49:56.240]  fail anyways. My fear flips to the other side and I just sit there and I don't have a death wish,
[1:49:56.240 --> 1:50:00.400]  but I'll be honest with you. I just say, Hey, you want to martyr me? You just go right ahead and do
[1:50:00.400 --> 1:50:06.160]  it. I just hope you're successful if you actually are successful and I'm not in some wheelchair
[1:50:06.160 --> 1:50:12.560]  from the neck down paralyzed. People say, don't let them know your fears. Hell, they already know
[1:50:12.560 --> 1:50:18.240]  my fears. The enemy knows exactly who I am. They know I'm for real and they were expecting
[1:50:18.240 --> 1:50:23.600]  organic responses like this to come up from the grassroots. And you look where it came from.
[1:50:23.600 --> 1:50:28.000]  Isn't it fitting? But it's coming from all over the country and all over the world as well.
[1:50:28.000 --> 1:50:33.360]  And more is coming. I've always known I'm just the first big wave. Other waves came before me.
[1:50:33.360 --> 1:50:40.000]  We're the first big wave and the enemy knows the tidal waves are coming. Tidal waves are coming.
[1:50:40.000 --> 1:50:45.120]  Waves so big they can't even see the tops of them and they're going to wreck this world government
[1:50:45.120 --> 1:50:51.120]  forever. They'll be able to find a piece of it like Atlantis when the god of this universe is done.
[1:50:51.840 --> 1:50:56.080]  The god of this world is not a god at all. He's fallen and he's weak.
[1:50:58.160 --> 1:51:02.640]  Are you prepared to bug out infidel body armor and an army ranger have produced a high speed

[1:52:00.880 --> 1:52:05.040]  vitality feeling better than you have in years and you noticed a difference in your sleeping
[1:52:05.040 --> 1:52:09.680]  patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall? There's something that is
[1:52:09.680 --> 1:52:15.040]  changing thousands of people's lives and you could be one of them. It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[1:52:15.040 --> 1:52:19.440]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of
[1:52:19.440 --> 1:52:24.160]  Heart and Body Extract. What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the

[1:52:30.080 --> 1:52:35.280]  itself. And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol,
[1:52:35.280 --> 1:52:40.720]  clean and unclog the arteries. It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics. So
[1:52:40.720 --> 1:52:45.760]  the body is an amazing thing. It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.

[1:53:27.040 --> 1:53:31.440]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year. Just this past August was
[1:53:31.440 --> 1:53:36.080]  when we spread his ashes on the St. Croix River. I loved my dad. But boy was he stubborn. He hadn't
[1:53:36.080 --> 1:53:41.680]  been to the doctor in over 25 years. His excuse? He simply couldn't afford it. He wasn't a rich man
[1:53:41.680 --> 1:53:46.880]  by any means. At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect
[1:53:46.880 --> 1:53:52.560]  alternative for my father. Don't wait. Go to libertyoncall.org right now for not just your
[1:53:52.560 --> 1:53:56.720]  sake, but for the sake of your loved ones. Again, that's libertyoncall.org.
[1:54:02.160 --> 1:54:06.640]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central. We're live. One of my great anchors or
[1:54:06.640 --> 1:54:12.160]  investigative journalists hosting The Fourth Hour. Today it's David Knight. I'll be here
[1:54:12.160 --> 1:54:18.320]  on Thursday right through to the weekend. I may have some family business to attend to on Friday,
[1:54:18.320 --> 1:54:23.600]  so it may be Paul Watson or David Knight. We'll see. But I'll be live right through to Christmas Eve
[1:54:24.320 --> 1:54:26.480]  next week. Christmas Day will be a retransmission.
[1:54:29.280 --> 1:54:33.040]  I wanted to do this project Veritas investigation. Then I want to get back to the full clip of
[1:54:33.040 --> 1:54:37.280]  Rand Paul saying we don't want World War III and really showing some of the most sane statements
[1:54:37.280 --> 1:54:41.280]  there and acting very presidential. So I want to say I'm impressed with Rand Paul being more
[1:54:41.280 --> 1:54:46.720]  aggressive. Very excited about that. We do have a guest coming in studio as well.
[1:54:47.760 --> 1:54:52.000]  Perry Dent on the economy and a lot more. So look forward to that in the next hour.
[1:54:52.000 --> 1:54:58.080]  Before I play this clip though from James O'Keefe, we are offering free shipping through the 18th.
[1:54:59.200 --> 1:55:04.800]  That's Friday. You need to order products by noon on Friday.
[1:55:04.800 --> 1:55:10.480]  If you want to be guaranteed to get your package before Christmas by the 24th,
[1:55:11.040 --> 1:55:14.000]  Christmas Eve. Might even get it quicker depending on where you are in the U.S.
[1:55:15.040 --> 1:55:21.120]  I mean, you might get it on Monday. But infowarslife.com products are also discounted right now.
[1:55:21.120 --> 1:55:25.520]  We've got 20% off X2 Nation I and the Good Halogen. Just read the reviews of what it's done for
[1:55:25.520 --> 1:55:30.240]  folks. It's amazing. The Essentials Pack, Revival Shield X2, Supermail Vitality or Femal Vitality
[1:55:30.240 --> 1:55:35.360]  and Silver Bullet 33% off. That is amazing. And it funds this operation. It's a win-win-win-win-win.
[1:55:36.160 --> 1:55:41.040]  Deep Cleanze Pack, Deep Cleanze Living Defense Oxi Powder 28% off, Winter Sun 15% off,
[1:55:41.040 --> 1:55:49.040]  and so many other discounts at infowarsstore.com or infowarslife.com. And when you fund our
[1:55:49.040 --> 1:55:53.760]  operation and get high quality products, the Hillary for Prison shirt, whatever the case is,
[1:55:54.320 --> 1:55:57.200]  you don't just promote the culture of liberty. You get great health products
[1:55:57.200 --> 1:56:03.920]  and you fund this operation. I mean, it's just so important. I want to thank you all for what
[1:56:03.920 --> 1:56:08.560]  you've done. And we'll continue to continue the course and expand what we're doing if the funds
[1:56:08.560 --> 1:56:12.720]  come in. You know, I'm giving a bunch of the crew that I can, little raises, little bonuses for
[1:56:12.720 --> 1:56:19.280]  Christmas. That'll continue if we continue to be able to get the funds and we'll get more crew.
[1:56:19.280 --> 1:56:24.240]  But I've got to be very judicious about what I do because a lot of other big talk show hosts
[1:56:24.240 --> 1:56:29.680]  have tried to expand, like up in North Texas that moved down here to Texas, which is fine.
[1:56:30.320 --> 1:56:35.120]  You know, the word is, are not doing too well. In fact, it's not word. I have the inside baseball
[1:56:35.120 --> 1:56:40.400]  on TV networks and channels and other things. And I admire folks that try to expand in the
[1:56:40.400 --> 1:56:46.800]  face of what's going on. It's hard to do though. And we're doing it. Slow and easy wins the race.
[1:56:46.800 --> 1:56:51.280]  Over 21 years though, it's kind of getting big here. And now we're facing down the barrel of
[1:56:51.280 --> 1:56:54.320]  the globalists. That's why we need your prayers and support more than ever. And why I have such
[1:56:54.320 --> 1:56:59.680]  solidarity and kinship with people like Matt Drudge or James O'Keefe or Joseph Farah or countless
[1:56:59.680 --> 1:57:03.520]  others. Because let me tell you, we're staring down the barrel of propaganda and violence and
[1:57:03.520 --> 1:57:09.760]  intimidation. Not a game. So I mean to win this. Let's go out to break the short clip of the
[1:57:09.760 --> 1:57:14.400]  investigation. Maryland Attorney General's office, sex, guns and egregious ethical violations.
[1:57:14.400 --> 1:57:17.200]  I'm bragging about how they're coming for the guns. I'll get to more of the clip in the next
[1:57:17.200 --> 1:57:21.760]  segment. But here it is.
[1:57:21.760 --> 1:57:35.360]  The biggest thing that's going on right now, the thing I just told you about, we know that's not public.
[1:57:35.360 --> 1:57:38.160]  EPA said it's coming out of the guns. It's not public.
[1:57:38.160 --> 1:57:53.760]  I think it really matters to be found out before the middle of the week.
[1:57:53.760 --> 1:58:10.160]  It's a two-way street.
[1:58:10.160 --> 1:58:17.360]  You claim you work for the CIA, you actually work for a bunch of foreign banks and we're coming back for the country.
[1:58:17.360 --> 1:58:25.760]  Our journalist met the Deputy Attorney General of Maryland here at NYU School of Law.
[1:58:25.760 --> 1:58:30.720]  Again, the video is up on infowars.com. It was up there last week. I'm going to repost it right now
[1:58:30.720 --> 1:58:35.760]  on infowars.com so you can share it. And the article about Trump exposing that the Bush has
[1:58:35.760 --> 1:58:42.320]  protected them in law. Pretty big video. Get that on infowars.com and hammer it out. You're a weapon system.
[1:58:42.320 --> 1:58:48.560]  Don't wait around for a shooting war. Savage the enemy now. Crush them with infowar. Savage them.
[1:58:48.560 --> 1:58:55.680]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.

[1:59:51.040 --> 1:59:53.680]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[1:59:53.680 --> 2:00:09.600]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:00:23.680 --> 2:00:34.720]  We are back live. I want to finish up with the World War III clip after Kasich and
[2:00:36.320 --> 2:00:40.880]  Christie called for punching the Russians in the nose, shooting down their planes, threatening Putin,
[2:00:41.760 --> 2:00:44.960]  and then the response of Rand Paul and then a clip that I want to spend more time on,
[2:00:44.960 --> 2:00:49.840]  but we've got a guest coming in studio that's from Michael Sabat's show and a congressional
[2:00:49.840 --> 2:00:56.000]  hearing on C-SPAN where the Yazidi tribe has been talking about what al-Qaeda does,
[2:00:56.000 --> 2:01:01.440]  sex-slaving little girls, and then eating them. They admit they do this. They make videos about it,
[2:01:01.440 --> 2:01:04.720]  eating hearts. They love it. This is who our government wants to let into the country and
[2:01:04.720 --> 2:01:09.920]  who they're allied with, and that whole deck of cards is coming down right now. So right now,
[2:01:09.920 --> 2:01:15.280]  let's go ahead and go to the World War III comment. If there was a no-fly zone,
[2:01:15.280 --> 2:01:21.040]  you say that potentially could lead to World War III. Why? Well, I think if you're in favor of World
[2:01:21.040 --> 2:01:29.760]  War III, you have your candidate. You know, here's the thing. My goodness, what we want in a leader
[2:01:29.760 --> 2:01:35.120]  is someone with judgment, not someone who is so reckless as to stand on the stage and say,
[2:01:35.120 --> 2:01:40.960]  yes, I'm jumping up and down. I'm going to shoot down Russian planes. Russia already flies in that
[2:01:40.960 --> 2:01:45.680]  airspace. It may not be something we're in love with the fact that they're there, but they were
[2:01:45.680 --> 2:01:51.440]  invited by Iraq and by Syria to fly in that airspace. And so if we announce we're going to have a
[2:01:51.440 --> 2:01:57.280]  no-fly zone and others have said this, Hillary Clinton's also for it. It is a recipe for disaster.
[2:01:57.280 --> 2:02:03.040]  It's a recipe for World War III. We need to confront Russia from a position of strength,
[2:02:03.040 --> 2:02:08.800]  but we don't need to confront Russia from a point of recklessness that would lead to war.
[2:02:08.800 --> 2:02:13.440]  This is something, this type of judgment, you know, it's having that kind of judgment. Who
[2:02:13.440 --> 2:02:17.520]  you would appoint and how you're going to conduct affairs. Almost the perfect answer,
[2:02:17.520 --> 2:02:21.120]  but I've studied the situation. Russia is not confronting anybody. They're trying to go free
[2:02:21.120 --> 2:02:26.320]  market. They kicked the oligarchs out. They got two military bases. We got 200. They're not messing
[2:02:26.320 --> 2:02:31.760]  with anybody. The bully is punching them in the nose and then saying that the 100-pound kid,
[2:02:31.760 --> 2:02:36.720]  the 200-pound bully's beating up, has done something. It's just not happening. We're a
[2:02:36.720 --> 2:02:42.560]  hijacked country, now an empire, running around committing war crimes and it has to stop. And
[2:02:42.560 --> 2:02:47.920]  these fat chicken hawks, I'm just sorry, shooting their mouths off. I guarantee you those guys are
[2:02:47.920 --> 2:02:52.560]  cowardly punks because nobody that's really knows what's going on or ever been involved in any real
[2:02:52.560 --> 2:02:56.000]  violence likes to shoot their mouths off about it. Now, speaking of violence, let's talk about the
[2:02:56.000 --> 2:03:01.360]  globalist proxy army shunned in by NATO and Saudi Arabia and others. And what they're up to when
[2:03:01.360 --> 2:03:06.240]  they get your women, whether it's in Africa or the Middle East, they admit this, sex slavery and
[2:03:06.240 --> 2:03:12.800]  then they kill them. Let's go ahead and go to the tape. Yesterday, a leader of the Yazidi people
[2:03:12.800 --> 2:03:17.840]  went before Congress. Thank God for the Republicans who invited Merza Ishmael,
[2:03:17.840 --> 2:03:22.400]  chairman of the Yazidi Human Rights Organization International, to try and tell the world what
[2:03:22.400 --> 2:03:27.840]  Obama is ignoring. Listen to clip three. Are you ready for this? You better hold on to your seats.
[2:03:27.840 --> 2:03:36.960]  Thousands of young Yazidi women, girls, and even children who, as I speak, have been enslaved
[2:03:36.960 --> 2:03:44.320]  and forced into sexual slavery. These girls are subjected to daily multiple rapes by ISIS
[2:03:44.320 --> 2:03:50.960]  monesters. According to many escaped women and girls whom I talked to in northern Iraq,
[2:03:50.960 --> 2:04:00.480]  the abducted Yazidi most humanized children number over 7,000. Some of those women and girls
[2:04:01.120 --> 2:04:08.560]  have had to watch seven, eight, and nine year old children bleed to death before their eyes,
[2:04:08.560 --> 2:04:15.520]  after being raped by ISIS militia multiple times a day. I know his English isn't as good as that
[2:04:15.520 --> 2:04:22.240]  of Barack Obama. I realize he's not as charming. But listen to clip four. This makes the better
[2:04:22.240 --> 2:04:30.160]  English. Host children were torn from them by ISIS. These same mothers came to plead for the return
[2:04:30.160 --> 2:04:40.320]  of their children, only to be informed that day the mothers had been fed the flesh of their own
[2:04:40.320 --> 2:04:48.640]  children by ISIS. They kidnapped girls as young as seven. They rape them by the hundreds, make
[2:04:48.640 --> 2:04:56.480]  money off of it. Once they can't sex sell, they cook. I mean, this is who our government backs, folks.
[2:04:58.480 --> 2:05:04.160]  A New York City principal has banned Christmas and the Pledge of Allegiance reports EAG News.
[2:05:04.160 --> 2:05:08.960]  The new principal has also eliminated Thanksgiving, despite clear notice from the city's Department
[2:05:08.960 --> 2:05:13.600]  of Education, allowing for holiday themes and symbols. The New York Post writes,
[2:05:13.600 --> 2:05:18.560]  we definitely can't say Christmas. Nothing with Christmas on it. Nothing with Santa.
[2:05:18.560 --> 2:05:24.160]  A local PTA president told the news site, no angels. We can't even have a star because it
[2:05:24.160 --> 2:05:30.800]  can represent a religious system like the star of David. The report states that about 95% of the
[2:05:30.800 --> 2:05:37.280]  students at Brooklyn's PS 169 are either Hispanic or Asian. And the assistant principal announced
[2:05:37.280 --> 2:05:42.720]  last month that the school is changing its holiday traditions to be sensitive to the diversity of
[2:05:42.720 --> 2:05:48.880]  our families. Not all children celebrate the same holidays, he added. And the Pledge of Allegiance
[2:05:48.880 --> 2:06:08.320]  was also ditched when the principal took office. You can find more reports on infowars.com.

[2:09:03.760 --> 2:09:10.240]  dent of harry dent dot com he's here in studio with us in austin texas uh we called up one to
[2:09:10.240 --> 2:09:15.360]  get him on the show and his uh his secretary or whatever said oh well he's out of town he's in
[2:09:15.360 --> 2:09:20.240]  austin texas we said well bingo let's get him in studio so he's here for the rest of the hour
[2:09:20.240 --> 2:09:24.960]  we'll try to get him to pop in or tape something for the nightly news as well but in the next
[2:09:24.960 --> 2:09:31.280]  10 minutes or so we're supposed to hear whether there's going to be a rate hike today or not and
[2:09:31.280 --> 2:09:35.840]  that's why it's so great to have uh him here in studio he's the author of the demographic cliff
[2:09:35.840 --> 2:09:39.840]  and the editor of the free newsletter economy and markets he's the founder of dent research he
[2:09:39.840 --> 2:09:45.600]  was one of the senior folks uh over at main capital and i'm not going to go over all of his business
[2:09:45.600 --> 2:09:50.240]  degrees from harvard and business school and the rest of it but he's worked for top fortune 100
[2:09:50.240 --> 2:09:55.840]  companies and he's been one of the most accurate predictors of uh long term mid term and short
[2:09:55.840 --> 2:10:02.000]  term trends us stocks come off high fed finally lifts key interest rate from near zero it just
[2:10:02.000 --> 2:10:08.800]  came out seconds ago guys can you print that from the ap the fellow reserve is raising interest rates
[2:10:08.800 --> 2:10:14.960]  after seven years of record lows but in signaling the further rate hikes will likely be made slowly
[2:10:14.960 --> 2:10:20.720]  as the economy strengthens further and muted inflation rises the feds move to lift the key
[2:10:20.720 --> 2:10:28.880]  rate by a quarter point to a range of 0.25 percent to 0.5 percent ends an extremely
[2:10:28.880 --> 2:10:34.880]  extraordinary seven-year period of near zero rates that began at the depths of the 2008
[2:10:34.880 --> 2:10:42.000]  financial crisis uh consumers and businesses could now face uh modestly higher rates on some
[2:10:42.000 --> 2:10:50.400]  loans so it was supposed to break at at at 215 eastern it broke at about 209 uh uh eastern uh
[2:10:50.400 --> 2:10:55.600]  and so mr dent boom right here as it breaks thank you for joining us yeah great to be here finally
[2:10:55.600 --> 2:11:00.000]  uh i was going into politics first until the news came out but i mean you've talked all about this
[2:11:00.000 --> 2:11:04.640]  you predicted what they would do what does this signify where is this going well first
[2:11:04.640 --> 2:11:09.600]  fall this will be the last raid hike by my forecast this is too late they should have done this a
[2:11:09.600 --> 2:11:15.280]  good bit ago at least six months ago now they're doing it when the economy is finally weakening
[2:11:15.280 --> 2:11:19.440]  only because they kind of force twos like jobs are still good but jobs is not the way to look at
[2:11:19.440 --> 2:11:26.320]  the economy it's a lagging indicator i look at retail sales are slowing manufacturing slowing
[2:11:26.320 --> 2:11:30.800]  all types of divergences in the stock market which we'll talk about say we're about to go
[2:11:30.800 --> 2:11:35.280]  into a recession uh jump bond yields are going up they're the first to see a recession because
[2:11:35.280 --> 2:11:40.080]  they're they're like really jittery about loan default so i think this is too late and i think
[2:11:40.080 --> 2:11:45.920]  by the time they would consider doing the next hike maybe in march april may uh they will not do it i
[2:11:45.920 --> 2:11:49.920]  think this will be the last rate hike they'll do a quarter and they'll be done for a long time because
[2:11:49.920 --> 2:11:54.160]  i think the economy is going to be the worst we'll see in a long time in 2016 well we've got
[2:11:54.160 --> 2:11:57.920]  your charts in the computer for tv viewers for radio locers we can talk through them we're going
[2:11:57.920 --> 2:12:02.800]  to break it about eight nine minutes you've got the floor here to break down your analysis where
[2:12:02.800 --> 2:12:07.680]  you think it's going the fact that your predictions have again come true pretty much you said they
[2:12:07.680 --> 2:12:11.840]  admit that by the winter that things were actually slowing they now admit that you're saying it's
[2:12:11.840 --> 2:12:16.320]  probably going to get a lot worse soon walk through it for the tv viewers and radio listeners
[2:12:16.320 --> 2:12:21.680]  across the world well i mean number one we've been saying for a long time the the everyday
[2:12:21.680 --> 2:12:27.520]  baby boomer peaked and spending in 2007 we predicted that 20 years ago because that happens at age
[2:12:27.520 --> 2:12:35.760]  46 now the affluent sector that the top 20 percent of consumers they control a little over 50 percent
[2:12:35.760 --> 2:12:41.440]  of income and spending so they're just as important they don't peak until age 54 which is right now
[2:12:41.440 --> 2:12:47.040]  here in late 2015 so we've been saying that the big surprise of there'll be a number of surprises
[2:12:47.040 --> 2:12:53.600]  in 2016 number one the affluent consumer will tail off and and that's going to be the final blow
[2:12:53.600 --> 2:12:59.120]  to consumer spending and they're doing this just as the Fed is raising rates number two Germany has
[2:12:59.120 --> 2:13:04.800]  the worst demographics in the world and that's what we specialize in worse than japan in the 90s
[2:13:04.800 --> 2:13:10.160]  for the next eight years so japan is going to weaken and they're holding up europe and then
[2:13:10.160 --> 2:13:15.600]  finally the great china bubble is bursting starting with stocks i'm going to show that within the next
[2:13:15.600 --> 2:13:20.160]  month or two china is going to see another sharp collapse likely in their stock market
[2:13:20.160 --> 2:13:23.920]  and then their real estate's going to follow and it's going to be game over around the world for
[2:13:23.920 --> 2:13:30.320]  real estate so china is the biggest thing i worry about i am predicting that 2016 will be the worst
[2:13:30.320 --> 2:13:36.240]  year for the stock market if you look from beginning to end of any year including 73 74
[2:13:36.240 --> 2:13:45.280]  2001 to 2008 since 1931 and what's scary is have you done a chart on your general accuracy i mean
[2:13:45.280 --> 2:13:49.360]  i've been following you for more than a decade i've gone back and looked at your stuff before that
[2:13:49.360 --> 2:13:55.200]  you predicted almost everything that's happened and you did it a lot of times against the conventional
[2:13:55.760 --> 2:14:00.480]  propaganda being put out from the financial sector yeah we always i don't try to be against
[2:14:00.480 --> 2:14:03.760]  the grain we just have different indicators we look at people and what they predict will be
[2:14:03.760 --> 2:14:07.760]  do we don't look at the government and then government's just react like like now they're
[2:14:07.760 --> 2:14:13.440]  reacting late to raise interest rates you know and they reacted late in 2008 to lower them they
[2:14:13.440 --> 2:14:19.040]  react they're not the future people spend money predictably from cradle to grave and i can tell
[2:14:19.040 --> 2:14:24.960]  you when people weigh the most eat the most calories by com 42 and i'm already thinking about
[2:14:24.960 --> 2:14:29.600]  saving more money yeah starting to cut back i mean a lot of folks are that by 45 50 but i'm
[2:14:29.600 --> 2:14:32.880]  already always been a little bit more advanced than the average person just and you know growing
[2:14:32.880 --> 2:14:38.320]  up in things i'm already thinking like i'm 50 and already starting to pull in my feelers yeah and
[2:14:38.320 --> 2:14:43.200]  that's when people should start saving but people do start saving in their late 40s it's when their
[2:14:43.200 --> 2:14:48.480]  kids leave the nest the kids are such an expense that most people have no room to save but after
[2:14:48.480 --> 2:14:54.240]  the kids leave oh people save and that's why the peak and spending comes at 46 it's not even the peak
[2:14:54.240 --> 2:15:00.080]  and income when they start saving for retirement and then when they retire not only do they not
[2:15:02.800 --> 2:15:07.200]  spend anymore they spend less unless they're not working in contributing to social security and
[2:15:07.200 --> 2:15:11.280]  medicare and all these things and and we're top heavy but nothing compared to japan or germany
[2:15:11.280 --> 2:15:16.480]  or italy i mean i look at their demographics yes i mean they're gone i mean it's they they're
[2:15:16.480 --> 2:15:21.440]  yeah retirement home and hawk is what i call japan i mean it really and and and they're not doing
[2:15:21.440 --> 2:15:26.960]  anything to encourage higher births uh young people in japan when the crisis hit there in
[2:15:26.960 --> 2:15:31.520]  the early 90s and they're still in crisis 25 years later because their demographics are so
[2:15:31.520 --> 2:15:35.760]  bad and they've been doing qe all over the place young people don't even want to have sex or date
[2:15:35.760 --> 2:15:40.320]  or or get married because they can't afford to they have part-time jobs they don't have any
[2:15:40.320 --> 2:15:44.880]  security or benefits that their parents had the the older people took all the benefits and left
[2:15:44.880 --> 2:15:49.760]  the young people with nothing so what else is coming looking at that camera right there mr dent
[2:15:49.760 --> 2:15:53.520]  i mean tell the folks out there watching and listening what else do you see coming well you
[2:15:53.520 --> 2:15:58.560]  know you know we have uh a chart we could throw up uh i've been showing this now for two years it's
[2:15:58.560 --> 2:16:03.840]  called a megaphone pattern and and it shows that every time we've seen a bubble remember the bubble
[2:16:03.840 --> 2:16:08.080]  that peaked in early 2000 with text talks well then there was a big crash here we see this and then
[2:16:08.080 --> 2:16:15.280]  we had a smaller bubble into 2007 and then it crashed and now we got another great bubble each
[2:16:15.280 --> 2:16:22.080]  bubble has taken us to new highs and each crash has taken us to new lows now this is a common pattern
[2:16:22.080 --> 2:16:26.800]  nobody in wall streets paying attention this anybody could see it if you're not blind they
[2:16:26.800 --> 2:16:32.240]  don't want to talk about it this chart says that the next crash ought to take us to 6 000 on the
[2:16:32.240 --> 2:16:40.320]  Dow or lower and probably by early 2017 or so so i'm seeing the signs that that that stocks are
[2:16:40.320 --> 2:16:46.000]  overvalued we're seeing the signs of slowing and retail and leading indicators we're seeing the sign
[2:16:46.000 --> 2:16:50.800]  that's that investors are no longer buying small cap stocks they're only buying large cap stocks
[2:16:50.800 --> 2:16:55.440]  in fact they're only buying google in facebook and stocks like that well interrupt i'm not
[2:16:55.440 --> 2:17:00.240]  tuning your horn but you said about four months ago hey you know by november by december you're
[2:17:00.240 --> 2:17:04.480]  going to really know it's a serious recession the bubbles are going to start imploding and up until
[2:17:04.480 --> 2:17:08.320]  that time the mainstream media was everything's fine it's getting great everything's wonderful
[2:17:08.320 --> 2:17:13.440]  they're going to raise interest rates anytime and now about two months after you said that
[2:17:13.440 --> 2:17:18.240]  they began to admit okay bad jobs numbers bad manufacturing numbers bad savings numbers they
[2:17:18.240 --> 2:17:22.480]  started admitting that okay we're not doing too well what is the real state of the economy and
[2:17:22.480 --> 2:17:26.080]  i know it's not evenly distributed around the world but what is the state of the global economy
[2:17:26.080 --> 2:17:31.280]  in sectors well well again again um there's certain sectors to go first and things again
[2:17:31.280 --> 2:17:36.800]  the the biggest thing i'm seeing i look at Nordstrom and tiffany to two of the flagship
[2:17:36.800 --> 2:17:42.080]  upscale retailers their stocks are down 30 to 40 percent in the last i used to go in Nordstroms and
[2:17:42.080 --> 2:17:46.240]  my girls wanted shoes or something maybe once or twice a year around this time and it was crawling
[2:17:46.240 --> 2:17:51.120]  with people it's not half as busy not happening now yeah and Nordstrom had to put on sales and so
[2:17:51.120 --> 2:17:56.480]  what i've been looking for again the average person in walmart and target that peaked way
[2:17:56.480 --> 2:18:02.240]  back in 2007 so so what we're looking for now i'm looking for signs that the upscale consumer
[2:18:02.240 --> 2:18:08.160]  is peaking and boy that is is crystal clear and when they go there's nobody left to spend
[2:18:08.160 --> 2:18:14.800]  and it's in the fed has made these upscale families who own almost all the stocks in in in this country
[2:18:14.800 --> 2:18:18.880]  incredibly wealthy through quantitative easing that has pushed stocks into another bubble even
[2:18:18.880 --> 2:18:23.840]  though the economy is not that good so so this is this is the biggest sign i'm looking for it but
[2:18:23.840 --> 2:18:29.360]  i tell you the crash in china and i've got a chart on that that's worth looking at alex said that
[2:18:29.360 --> 2:18:35.360]  when china crashed 42 percent just months ago that was the same thing that happened in 1929
[2:18:35.360 --> 2:18:41.360]  when that bubble burst in the united states both crashed 42 percent in two and a half months
[2:18:41.360 --> 2:18:46.480]  and now china is rebounding only because the chinese government is spending hundreds of billions
[2:18:46.480 --> 2:18:52.000]  of dollars this is like qe for stocks to buy their own stock market to create a bounce the same thing
[2:18:52.000 --> 2:18:57.200]  the u.s government did in late 29 that only lasted a few months and won't that just stagnate things
[2:18:57.200 --> 2:19:02.960]  like japan huh won't that just stagnate things like japan yeah well china is the next japan japan

[2:25:34.000 --> 2:25:39.840]  christmas shopping done right now prison planet dot tv harry dent there's so many questions i've
[2:25:39.840 --> 2:25:46.960]  got on the rounded top the war talk uh deflation uh who do you like in the presidential race um
[2:25:46.960 --> 2:25:50.400]  and how do you protect yourself we'll get to some of that in the next segment uh but what
[2:25:50.400 --> 2:25:55.760]  do you want to hit first more of these graphs yeah i wanted to show one graph the the rounded top
[2:25:55.760 --> 2:26:00.880]  because we're at a very critical place on the stock market and i've been looking for a top and
[2:26:00.880 --> 2:26:05.360]  i'm finally seeing the divergences large caps are doing great as i said and small caps are doing
[2:26:05.360 --> 2:26:11.680]  horrible that's the classic sign of a top and what we've seen since may 18th which was actually the
[2:26:11.680 --> 2:26:18.320]  top in the s and p 500 and dow thus far every time before that the market just made slight new
[2:26:18.320 --> 2:26:23.920]  highs and slight new highs now every time it rallies we'd see a different trend it's making
[2:26:23.920 --> 2:26:28.960]  slightly lower highs and and and and i think that's going to happen again here we're just
[2:26:28.960 --> 2:26:34.960]  rallying around this fed hike i think it's going to go up to about 2000 on the s and p 500 and
[2:26:34.960 --> 2:26:38.800]  is probably going to stop there if it doesn't it's going to make a new high and and i tell you if
[2:26:38.800 --> 2:26:43.360]  that happens you definitely should sell your stocks in that new high but i think it's more
[2:26:43.360 --> 2:26:47.680]  likely it will fail again and then we'll start heading down and i think we're going to see
[2:26:48.240 --> 2:26:54.080]  a crash bigger than 2008 in the same time frame but it's going to take about a year and a half
[2:26:54.080 --> 2:26:59.120]  from the top but it's going to go down harder because we've extended this bubble through through
[2:26:59.120 --> 2:27:04.960]  funny money free money for seven years now and just stretched everything bigger bubbles more
[2:27:04.960 --> 2:27:09.760]  debt there's 57 trillion dollars more debt in the world and there wasn't and there's more derivatives
[2:27:09.760 --> 2:27:15.280]  right more derivatives more almost everything let me ask you this because you did nail a lot of
[2:27:15.280 --> 2:27:19.120]  predictions this one you got right you said they're not going to raise rates to maybe you know in the
[2:27:19.120 --> 2:27:25.120]  winter maybe a quarter of a point one done but you said you know within weeks or months the crash
[2:27:25.120 --> 2:27:29.520]  will become evident that we're going into it that's pretty much about a 98 percent accurate i mean
[2:27:29.520 --> 2:27:33.040]  they're not calling it a crash but a lot of indicators are showing it they're still trying
[2:27:33.040 --> 2:27:39.040]  to prop it up with the you know this force field of qe but then how do you define a crash i mean
[2:27:39.040 --> 2:27:43.440]  were you dead on with that prediction well i tell you know in that chart i showed earlier
[2:27:43.440 --> 2:27:48.880]  if we do head down and break what i call like 1880 in the s and p 500 i've got reasons for that
[2:27:48.880 --> 2:27:57.360]  that will lead to a crash down to 1600 or lower once you get substantially more than 20 it says
[2:27:57.360 --> 2:28:02.160]  the bubble's over we've seen 12 percent in the crash into august and that was bigger than the
[2:28:02.160 --> 2:28:07.520]  october crash last year so it shows the momentum's heading downward but i need to see that over 20
[2:28:07.520 --> 2:28:12.960]  percent then i can say this bubble is over so you're saying the indicators are there they even
[2:28:12.960 --> 2:28:19.440]  in that it's starting to fail but it could go really down fast anytime yes well when this thing
[2:28:19.440 --> 2:28:24.800]  finally breaks it is going to go down fast and again so it's gonna be an elevator yes that's
[2:28:24.800 --> 2:28:28.880]  why i tell people you're better to get out a little early than a little late in a bubble
[2:28:28.880 --> 2:28:33.520]  better to miss that last five or 10 percent then all of a sudden oh it's down 42 percent what do i
[2:28:33.520 --> 2:28:38.320]  do now well people panic are you out completely are you yes i'm out of definitely out of when
[2:28:38.320 --> 2:28:45.520]  did you get out oh my god i got out and back in april you sometimes wish you'd wrote it some more
[2:28:45.520 --> 2:28:50.560]  no no well the market's been up very little since then yeah you're right it's been kind of flat
[2:28:50.560 --> 2:28:56.160]  yeah it's been flat since november 2014 the market's gone nowhere and that's the first time in this
[2:28:56.160 --> 2:29:00.560]  bubble despite mega money printing and stock buying by governments all over the world that's right
[2:29:00.560 --> 2:29:05.600]  it in other words artificial stimulus can never work forever because it's something for nothing
[2:29:05.600 --> 2:29:08.960]  it's kind of like a balloon once it starts getting out of helium it gets that point we're just kind
[2:29:08.960 --> 2:29:14.160]  of list it stops lifting and then suddenly it starts falling yeah you can only pump this economy
[2:29:14.160 --> 2:29:20.880]  has failing slowing demographics debt burdens unbelievable more than makes the 1920s look like
[2:29:20.880 --> 2:29:26.880]  nothing mentally old political systems yeah the economy wants to detox de leverage and the government
[2:29:26.880 --> 2:29:31.600]  won't let it okay it's just going to do it anyway harry denser guest harry dot com i want to come back
[2:29:31.600 --> 2:29:37.280]  then talk about wildcards but are they really wildcards it seems wars and all sorts of political
[2:29:37.280 --> 2:29:44.640]  tyranny comes historically with these down times show how will those affect it straight ahead we'll
[2:29:44.640 --> 2:29:54.560]  be back we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[2:29:54.560 --> 2:30:04.720]  gonna list and he's checking it twice he's gonna find out who's that's right the feds are coming
[2:30:04.720 --> 2:30:10.960]  to town the f a a has just sent their dictate throughout the land any motorized planes heavier
[2:30:10.960 --> 2:30:16.960]  than a half pound i repeat a half pound will have to be registered by december 21st if santa
[2:30:16.960 --> 2:30:22.240]  gives you one you can't fly it outside without registering it on their list fail to do so and
[2:30:22.240 --> 2:30:29.280]  the f a a will find you $27,500 without due process calling it a civil fine if they come
[2:30:29.280 --> 2:30:34.640]  after you criminally quarter of a million dollars and three years in jail for not registering your
[2:30:34.640 --> 2:30:39.840]  half pound and heavier plane this regulation won't do anything to enforce the current prohibitions
[2:30:39.840 --> 2:30:44.480]  of flying close to airports and they should be concerned if they can't protect airports from
[2:30:44.480 --> 2:30:50.240]  toy planes because that means they certainly can't protect airports from shoulder fired missiles
[2:30:50.240 --> 2:30:55.520]  and guess what the jihadis won't be registering those with the f a a rent for wars dot com i'm

[2:33:39.760 --> 2:33:47.600]  i had stations in uh new york state new mexico california and texas called me on my cell phone
[2:33:47.600 --> 2:33:50.960]  yesterday and so i know they're hitting the producers and affiliate relations up the network
[2:33:50.960 --> 2:33:55.840]  in minnesota i'm down here in austin texas saying hey we want to carry info wars nightly news
[2:33:56.560 --> 2:34:02.240]  debate coverage on our stations and i never even thought it's our live coverage of special events
[2:34:02.240 --> 2:34:07.920]  that's so popular and i'm targeting u h f v h f and cable stations which we're starting to get some
[2:34:07.920 --> 2:34:12.080]  in the last month without even really promoting it yet that we push that next year we just got up
[2:34:12.080 --> 2:34:17.680]  on the sideline a few months ago but it's the a m and f m that actually want the nightly news
[2:34:18.320 --> 2:34:22.080]  and without even promoting it we've already got a whole bunch of station picking that up
[2:34:22.080 --> 2:34:28.240]  it's very exciting folks to praise god for that i mean seriously uh the show is exploding and
[2:34:30.400 --> 2:34:33.760]  instead of clear channel coming after me like they used to do they're just telling their host
[2:34:33.760 --> 2:34:39.600]  adopt our tactics and let me tell you that's when you know you're winning people is imitation is the
[2:34:39.600 --> 2:34:44.800]  most sincere form of flattery and i don't want to be the big no at all up here with a libertarian
[2:34:44.800 --> 2:34:51.200]  anti-globalist perspective you know capitalist perspective i want to win the culture war and
[2:34:51.200 --> 2:34:57.360]  have other people more eloquent more more school than i be influenced by my research and my guest
[2:34:57.360 --> 2:35:03.280]  research and basically adopt many of our ideas because our ideas are superior i mean hands down
[2:35:03.280 --> 2:35:08.800]  this is not a dumb but show this is not this is not just milk toast one topic over and over again
[2:35:08.800 --> 2:35:14.080]  with mindless talking points with a bunch of liberal or conservative parents debating it this is real
[2:35:14.080 --> 2:35:19.040]  americana real renaissance speaking of real renaissance there's ways to protect yourself
[2:35:19.040 --> 2:35:24.320]  in the demographic cliff that we're clearly going over and harry dent has his book demographic
[2:35:24.320 --> 2:35:29.840]  cliff for free it's 495 for the shipping i have to know with shipping and handling
[2:35:29.840 --> 2:35:36.480]  with media mail that's what it cost so this is at cost you add in other issues i bet you're

[2:35:47.920 --> 2:35:52.480]  a lost leader if you don't get the book for 495 at least give it to friends and family you may
[2:35:52.480 --> 2:35:56.880]  know all about this give it to somebody if you don't get a book at that cost i mean it's really

[2:37:26.880 --> 2:37:32.320]  i'm now ranting about that subject i do want to open the phones up for quick questions for
[2:37:32.320 --> 2:37:42.800]  mr dent while we've got him your economic questions at 800-259-9231 800-259-9231
[2:37:42.800 --> 2:37:48.240]  and we will take your phone calls as well just open those phones up about two minutes ago okay
[2:37:48.880 --> 2:37:53.600]  you heard my question before the break mr dent what about wild cards of war that tend to in
[2:37:53.600 --> 2:37:57.920]  my graphs looking at history tend to pop up almost always around big economic downturns we
[2:37:57.920 --> 2:38:03.600]  see the evidence of it happening again what about social unrest how do those exacerbate
[2:38:04.800 --> 2:38:10.880]  problems and why do you historically think there are responsive governments as they see a slide
[2:38:10.880 --> 2:38:16.480]  happening and how can we protect ourselves from this what are you doing economically to not just
[2:38:16.480 --> 2:38:22.400]  survive but thrive in this climate well you know first of all you you look at the great depression
[2:38:22.400 --> 2:38:28.880]  led to world war two uh you know hitler was rising and and and when you have a fixed pie or a shrinking
[2:38:28.880 --> 2:38:33.920]  pie it makes sense for governments to expand at others expense for germany to roll into
[2:38:33.920 --> 2:38:39.280]  poland and france and the rest of europe and the same thing for japan so so there there is a reason
[2:38:39.280 --> 2:38:44.560]  when the economies get weak there is a big motive for war now you look at russia russia is one of
[2:38:44.560 --> 2:38:52.480]  the worst demographic countries uh had already is and russia has falling oil and and commodity prices
[2:38:52.480 --> 2:38:56.880]  which is their bread and butter so they're in real trouble there's every incentive for putin
[2:38:56.880 --> 2:39:02.160]  to try to expand into ukraine and georgia and any place he can so so that's going to continue to
[2:39:02.160 --> 2:39:08.800]  happen but more importantly alex i've got a not i have a geopolitical indicator that is just incredible
[2:39:08.800 --> 2:39:16.240]  every 35 years for about 17 18 years everything's hunky dory and then for 17 18 years everything's
[2:39:16.240 --> 2:39:22.480]  terrible and basically we had great geopolitical trends from 83 to 2000 think of what went wrong
[2:39:22.480 --> 2:39:25.760]  in the world back then the worst thing that happened we had a hundred hour war with saddam
[2:39:25.760 --> 2:39:29.440]  mussein and kicked him out and didn't try to take over the country and it was all over
[2:39:30.640 --> 2:39:38.080]  from 9 11 to now and into late 2019 at a minimum this geopolitical cycle keeps getting worse i'm
[2:39:38.080 --> 2:39:43.920]  not surprised to see the metro jet go down from russia and the terrorist attacks in paris the
[2:39:43.920 --> 2:39:51.280]  isis rose out of our failure in iraq we left there after not winning a war and they basically took
[2:39:51.280 --> 2:39:57.920]  all the disaffected sunni soldiers in generals and turned them into isis now we got a huge problem
[2:39:57.920 --> 2:40:02.560]  so this is going to continue and this is another reason the stock market's not just going to keep
[2:40:02.560 --> 2:40:09.200]  be able to keep going up living on stimulus and qe a bad geopolitical trends make the stock market
[2:40:09.200 --> 2:40:14.640]  worth and food's running out all over the world populations are ballooning the bizarre left
[2:40:14.640 --> 2:40:20.160]  then wants to import these motley crews to use them as political weapons i mean i agree the trends
[2:40:20.160 --> 2:40:24.880]  the history it's all there you add though all these other things that we didn't have previously
[2:40:24.880 --> 2:40:29.680]  this looks downright explosive and we have ministry of defense reports from 2007 and pentagon
[2:40:29.680 --> 2:40:35.680]  reports predicting all this starting 2016 and beyond it basically meshes with your graphs yeah it does
[2:40:35.680 --> 2:40:40.640]  and i tell you europe is got the worst of it here they're already having seen the euro disintegrate
[2:40:40.640 --> 2:40:45.280]  because of the rich countries versus the poor countries that disparity is causing imbalance
[2:40:45.280 --> 2:40:51.040]  now this paris attack they have open borders you know they have open in migration and open
[2:40:51.040 --> 2:40:56.000]  trade of goods this is ending every country is going to say we got to protect our borders now
[2:40:56.000 --> 2:41:00.880]  and that's the last bloat of the euro and the year and europe is right there next to russia
[2:41:00.880 --> 2:41:05.200]  russia's going to bear the bond i mean europe's going to bear the brunt of this russian aggression
[2:41:05.200 --> 2:41:09.680]  and the brunt of the middle east uh terrorist attacks it's going to rise it's harder for them
[2:41:09.680 --> 2:41:15.360]  to attack here our muslims are more integrated europe are not so europe is really going to get
[2:41:15.360 --> 2:41:21.040]  hard in the next seven years i think this we're seeing a peak not for the us as much more like a
[2:41:21.040 --> 2:41:26.560]  plateau a peak for europe europe's never going to be the same what about bizarre cultural suicide
[2:41:26.560 --> 2:41:32.800]  leftist behavior peaking with them saying bound you ban brown paper bags and darth vaders racist
[2:41:32.800 --> 2:41:38.160]  ban him i mean the so-called left and i'm not a left or right guy i mean i'm just a libertarian i
[2:41:38.160 --> 2:41:43.520]  used to be you know against bush but i wasn't for the democrats they really do act like crazy people
[2:41:43.520 --> 2:41:50.000]  with the stuff on cnn the stuff on msnbc the bizarreness at the colleges you know saying
[2:41:50.000 --> 2:41:54.880]  change the name of a building from lynch hall because lynch reminds them of lynching but
[2:41:54.880 --> 2:41:59.120]  don't change the attorney general's name i mean it really has reached a mental illness level
[2:42:00.160 --> 2:42:04.400]  how do you see that affecting things well you know this is what i would i'd call a bipolar
[2:42:04.400 --> 2:42:11.120]  political situation i i i see extreme problems on the extreme right and extreme left and things
[2:42:11.120 --> 2:42:16.880]  are moving in both directions and this happens when you have times of income inequality like the
[2:42:16.880 --> 2:42:24.240]  roaring 20s and now where the top 1% control 50% of the wealth and things like that you get this
[2:42:24.240 --> 2:42:29.680]  bipolar thing and neither side can agree with each other that's why you can't pass any effective
[2:42:29.680 --> 2:42:34.720]  bill but a lot of the ultra rich are the ones financing the left and this class envy oh it's
[2:42:34.720 --> 2:42:38.640]  misdirected at the middle class well and they're financing that the right the coke brothers pretty
[2:42:38.640 --> 2:42:44.960]  much vetoed mit romney that you know they want somebody farther right and stuff and so this is
[2:42:44.960 --> 2:42:49.760]  this is not a healthy sign this is where we were in the late 20s early 30s and and we had to have
[2:42:49.760 --> 2:42:56.240]  the system break down where would we be if mit romney was in oh frankly i don't think politicians
[2:42:56.240 --> 2:43:00.880]  make that bigger difference let me ask you this for you only in a crisis do they i don't think we'd
[2:43:00.880 --> 2:43:05.920]  be that much different but i i think we might be better off on foreign policy sure i want to go to
[2:43:05.920 --> 2:43:09.920]  some calls in a moment we'll also play rand paul saying greatest threat to national security is debt
[2:43:10.640 --> 2:43:14.000]  but before we do that i need to see the call screen up there guys so i can tell you who the
[2:43:14.000 --> 2:43:18.800]  callers are let me ask you this who do you like though this is a personal guys that you know is
[2:43:18.800 --> 2:43:24.960]  a father of the candidates uh hillary bernie sanders donald trump rand paul uh ted cruz i mean
[2:43:24.960 --> 2:43:30.240]  who do you overall in in in general think you might make a better president i understand
[2:43:30.240 --> 2:43:34.720]  they probably can't change that much overall but at least a rand paul wouldn't come after our guns
[2:43:34.720 --> 2:43:39.600]  at least the ted cruz or a donald trump wouldn't come after our guns and doesn't have some suicide
[2:43:39.600 --> 2:43:44.560]  wish for the country in my view well you know i don't really like any of them i i don't think we
[2:43:44.560 --> 2:43:48.960]  have a good choice of candidates trump is at least saying some things that need to be said i like
[2:43:48.960 --> 2:43:53.760]  trump but you know and then he turns around and says something totally crazy like we're going to
[2:43:53.760 --> 2:43:59.600]  cut off 11 million immigrants back that would cost a fortune it would be impossible to do
[2:44:00.240 --> 2:44:05.040]  and it would cause an instant recession from the loss of jobs and its income and spending
[2:44:05.040 --> 2:44:10.480]  even if it were temporary so you know i i if i had to pick one i would agree more with rand paul
[2:44:10.480 --> 2:44:16.640]  because i'm more of a libertarian in in in that he is the best overall but if for me the guy i would
[2:44:16.640 --> 2:44:22.800]  like to see is somebody like michael bloomberg run a big city he's a billionaire i i've been in blue
[2:44:22.800 --> 2:44:28.400]  no i know but he he's good on a lot of business stuff but he's anti-gun yeah but i can live with
[2:44:28.400 --> 2:44:32.560]  that i mean we already have 300 some million guns so so you know you don't think you'd be able to get
[2:44:32.560 --> 2:44:37.520]  them well well first of all you can't do much about it at this point but but i i don't see i don't
[2:44:37.520 --> 2:44:42.560]  think gun owners i think there are some extremes in gun ownership people shouldn't have ak-47s come
[2:44:42.560 --> 2:44:46.480]  on you don't hunt with that no no but i i mean i understand your view on that but the ak-47s
[2:44:46.480 --> 2:44:49.840]  aren't committing crimes most of the time i mean it's people doing it but those aren't even guns
[2:44:49.840 --> 2:44:54.320]  they want to well the terrorists use them yeah they want to demonize a certain type of gun
[2:44:54.320 --> 2:44:59.360]  and then once they set the president to ban that they can ban everything yeah but but but again i
[2:44:59.360 --> 2:45:04.240]  want somebody that can have respect overseas i don't see any of the candidates that overseas
[2:45:04.240 --> 2:45:08.800]  diplomats and prime ministers around the world would respect who's the best you think though i
[2:45:08.800 --> 2:45:13.840]  mean on that front maybe rand paul no i i don't what do you think about the statement i don't
[2:45:13.840 --> 2:45:19.840]  think i don't think cruise i don't think trump i'd bernie sanders no way hillary would get the most
[2:45:19.840 --> 2:45:25.120]  respect from from what do you think about k-6 saying punch the russians in the nose uh what do
[2:45:25.120 --> 2:45:31.120]  you make uh with uh christy saying let's shoot down russian jets i mean it sounded like frothing
[2:45:31.120 --> 2:45:37.760]  mad dogs yeah no no i mean we have we have been too aggressive we can no longer police the world
[2:45:37.760 --> 2:45:42.880]  we don't have the capacity we failed in vietnam then we failed in iraq failed in afghanistan
[2:45:42.880 --> 2:45:48.080]  we can fight an on and on war against somebody like russia like if they invade ukraine that we
[2:45:48.080 --> 2:45:53.520]  can do but fighting these guerrilla wars and and i would not provoke russia why would you provoke
[2:45:53.520 --> 2:45:58.240]  russia if they do attack we support our allies but we have to get people to defend themselves
[2:45:58.240 --> 2:46:02.160]  in their own territories and support them rather than us being the ones come in
[2:46:02.160 --> 2:46:07.280]  and do it for them we can't afford that and especially in the middle east you go in the
[2:46:07.280 --> 2:46:12.400]  middle east even if you win even if you help people they still hate you because you're considered
[2:46:12.400 --> 2:46:19.840]  infidels they don't want us and isis is trying to tempt us every way they can to come into the
[2:46:19.840 --> 2:46:25.360]  middle east boots on the ground so they can defeat us once and for all well they should
[2:46:25.360 --> 2:46:31.520]  not do that at any cost absolutely and it comes down to this i love everybody i am a true classical
[2:46:31.520 --> 2:46:35.600]  liberal at the end of the day and i was against all these wars against the muslims and stuffs i
[2:46:35.600 --> 2:46:40.080]  knew would stir them up and it would be a problem that said though studying it i mean a large portion
[2:46:40.080 --> 2:46:45.200]  of muslims especially you know the whole behobvious groups they literally hate my guts and say i'm
[2:46:45.200 --> 2:46:50.080]  trash and want to enslave me and my family and i mean and the political correct folks can't respond
[2:46:50.080 --> 2:46:54.080]  to that but i mean i'm not the one doing this if you like if i was jewish and i said hitler's
[2:46:54.080 --> 2:46:58.160]  coming after me i mean i'm not supposed to say i like hitler because i'm you know anti-german if
[2:46:58.160 --> 2:47:03.440]  i don't like hitler or i'm anti-soviet because i'm a capitalist and they want to arrest me i mean
[2:47:03.440 --> 2:47:08.560]  radical islam is taking over islam it wants to conquer me and my family it's super oppressive
[2:47:08.560 --> 2:47:13.840]  it's stone age it's dark age i don't like it and i'm gonna say the truth about it well you know i
[2:47:13.840 --> 2:47:17.840]  know bill marr is one of the more most liberal people out there he's comedian but he's a real
[2:47:17.840 --> 2:47:22.560]  political commentator and he says the same thing he said there is something fundamentally wrong
[2:47:22.560 --> 2:47:28.480]  with their approach and their beliefs and and and it is difficult and and you know it somebody
[2:47:28.480 --> 2:47:33.360]  should start saying look if they don't reform their religion they're going to provoke a lot of
[2:47:33.360 --> 2:47:40.000]  backlash there's no question about it yeah i mean come on i mean they're the the middle east is not
[2:47:40.000 --> 2:47:44.960]  going to win a war with europe now and and the thing is the socialists want to make a deal with
[2:47:44.960 --> 2:47:48.880]  them to come in and checkmate and take over they're going to stab them in the back too i mean we've
[2:47:48.880 --> 2:47:53.600]  got to reform islam or there's going to be this class of civilizations and i'm telling you the
[2:47:53.600 --> 2:47:58.240]  muslims are going to lose yes i mean they had the only thing they have in their favor is is
[2:47:58.240 --> 2:48:03.280]  conviction and demographics because they breed more than we do and they and they know that
[2:48:04.000 --> 2:48:09.600]  and why wouldn't europe want to repopulate with say people from chili or something who are christian
[2:48:09.600 --> 2:48:13.920]  have some free market ideas i'm nothing against the folks in the middle east of stuff but i mean
[2:48:13.920 --> 2:48:20.000]  this just doesn't come it doesn't go together there's been major wars for 1400 years parts of europe
[2:48:20.000 --> 2:48:25.440]  got to poland in spain got taken over i mean i don't know i don't understand this idea that
[2:48:25.440 --> 2:48:30.320]  bring in these people who say they're going to conquer us yeah and that's why we're fortunate
[2:48:30.320 --> 2:48:35.360]  we we attract people especially from well from asia but especially mexico and latin america
[2:48:35.360 --> 2:48:40.240]  and they are more like us they are they tend to be christians it's easier to assimilate people
[2:48:40.240 --> 2:48:44.480]  that have at least a similar so why isn't europe's in trying to get latin americans to well because
[2:48:44.480 --> 2:48:50.000]  it's hard they're far away i mean where they are you if you look south of europe well what you have
[2:48:50.000 --> 2:48:54.400]  is north like oh here's the muslim countries they've invaded us about a hundred times let's just give
[2:48:54.400 --> 2:49:00.800]  part of syria to albania i mean i just can't handle it i mean our elites are really out of control
[2:49:00.800 --> 2:49:06.320]  uh who's up first here eric in minnesota you're on the air you got a question for harry din
[2:49:07.920 --> 2:49:12.880]  hey thank you elix i just love listening to your show buying all your products thank you
[2:49:13.600 --> 2:49:18.000]  really show off the liberals up there in minnesota that there's a lot of free thinkers
[2:49:18.880 --> 2:49:24.160]  i understand brother what's your question okay my question is uh our family we're looking to
[2:49:24.160 --> 2:49:30.640]  sell our house and my question for harry is would you recommend us selling the house right now
[2:49:30.640 --> 2:49:36.400]  and then maybe renting for a year or two and then finding a good price after this uh recession or
[2:49:36.400 --> 2:49:41.200]  this downturn hit excellent question eric god bless you yes merry christmas go ahead eric
[2:49:41.200 --> 2:49:46.400]  a hundred percent real estate even more than stocks because even if i'm a little late selling
[2:49:46.400 --> 2:49:52.240]  stocks i can still sell them any minute of the day real estate freezes up gets very illiquid fast
[2:49:52.240 --> 2:49:59.040]  when we see a crash like we saw in 2008 i've been telling people sell real estate by early 2016
[2:49:59.040 --> 2:50:03.920]  in the latest and if you get a don't be too picky if you get a reasonable offer take it and i think
[2:50:03.920 --> 2:50:10.480]  it's going to be a number of years before we get a buy opportunity maybe at least 2020 possibly earlier
[2:50:10.480 --> 2:50:16.960]  of course there's always great deals in in in a crash but it's i've been renting since late 2005
[2:50:16.960 --> 2:50:22.160]  when i predicted the real estate would crash last time around and it did so you predicted when it
[2:50:22.160 --> 2:50:26.720]  would crash yeah well i said in late 2005 this bubble's getting ready to burst and then a few
[2:50:26.720 --> 2:50:34.080]  months later housing prices peaked in early 2016 you called it really close though in 2008
[2:50:34.080 --> 2:50:40.240]  in 2007 eight we called that 20 years in advance but you even called i haven't read the articles
[2:50:40.240 --> 2:50:44.400]  in a while but did you call it right in the exact sector while we were well we warned it was coming
[2:50:44.400 --> 2:50:48.800]  you know that that market kind of sneaked in we we called that one a little bit after we said okay
[2:50:48.800 --> 2:50:52.880]  now the stock market finally but at first it didn't look like a peak we're going to come back and uh

[2:53:16.640 --> 2:53:21.840]  visit and the family you want to protect look i've made predictions like this before a few
[2:53:21.840 --> 2:53:28.080]  years ago i warned that the housing prices would collapse before that i warned that dot com companies
[2:53:28.080 --> 2:53:34.080]  would crash and they did those who listened had a chance to save themselves but this has nothing
[2:53:34.080 --> 2:53:41.280]  to do with the stock market this will affect us all i've posted a free video at dollar danger

[2:54:17.280 --> 2:54:21.280]  it's all being free folks we'll do five more minutes to the next hour with mr jett and we're
[2:54:21.280 --> 2:54:25.920]  gonna interview him jacari jackson's for the night news tonight uh david night's gonna be taken over
[2:54:25.920 --> 2:54:34.000]  he's gonna be talking about uh the no fly zones the calls for war the g.o.p. debates the f.a.a. coming
[2:54:34.000 --> 2:54:40.000]  to town this is so big saying even a half pound toy plane i mean stuff that cost 20 these little
[2:54:40.000 --> 2:54:45.760]  buddy drones that they'll give you huge fines in prison time if you don't register with the f.a.a.
[2:54:45.760 --> 2:54:51.280]  and the power to tax is the power to destroy 27 thousand dollar fines 250 thousand dollar fines
[2:54:51.280 --> 2:54:57.200]  three years in prison uh this is just unbelievable uh and they are gonna already geolocate with the
[2:54:57.200 --> 2:55:02.320]  drones where they can't fly in restricted areas this is so incredible and i predict this is gonna
[2:55:02.320 --> 2:55:07.520]  be ignored massively like the 15 thousand dollar fines that obama put in for garage sales no one
[2:55:07.520 --> 2:55:12.000]  follows that but it just shows i'm not kidding folks type that in 15 million dollar fines for
[2:55:12.000 --> 2:55:16.480]  garage sales the feds say they're illegal i want to take some more phone calls here
[2:55:16.480 --> 2:55:23.280]  with mr dent uh who's up next here let's go ahead and talk to george in connecticut
[2:55:23.280 --> 2:55:30.480]  you're on the air go ahead mr dent i'm presently most of my investments are in ira and i basically
[2:55:30.480 --> 2:55:36.720]  dissolved almost everything except g gld uh small portion i'm trying to think about maybe putting it
[2:55:36.720 --> 2:55:43.520]  into a real estate or into real gold uh you know a solid goal under my name but i do you have to
[2:55:43.520 --> 2:55:48.960]  take delivery type of thing to be sure because my greatest concern is they're going to be doing
[2:55:48.960 --> 2:55:54.480]  bail ins uh the government is saying oh the ira well let's take uh 50 percent they're already
[2:55:54.480 --> 2:55:58.080]  talking about that and they've done it in europe but then i mean so there's a lot of questions
[2:55:58.080 --> 2:56:02.080]  there what about them going after cash bail ins what do you protect how do you protect yourself
[2:56:02.080 --> 2:56:06.720]  from that thank you george here's some point thing this this downturn will be unlike any
[2:56:06.720 --> 2:56:11.120]  downturn in your lifetime it will be like the thirties when you get bubbles and everything
[2:56:11.120 --> 2:56:18.000]  everything's bubbled up real estate commodities gold was a bubble and is bursting stocks all around
[2:56:18.000 --> 2:56:24.240]  the world everything crashes just like in 2008 look at late 2008 when the meltdown actually
[2:56:24.240 --> 2:56:29.760]  happened and leeman brothers was was melting down stocks commodities gold went down and you've
[2:56:29.760 --> 2:56:34.160]  been predicting the deflation and and you've been you've been proven right now now isn't it true though
[2:56:34.160 --> 2:56:39.280]  10 15 20 years down the road gold's going to go stratospheric though absolutely the emerging world
[2:56:39.280 --> 2:56:44.960]  is going to drive the next boom from 2000 early 2020s forward they are heavy commodity buyers
[2:56:44.960 --> 2:56:50.880]  and heavy gold buyers for me gold is an emergency thing that you literally bury and then in an
[2:56:50.880 --> 2:56:55.760]  emergency you can at least get something for it but down the road i mean it's just going to be
[2:56:55.760 --> 2:56:59.520]  absolutely valuable with all this inflation that will come after the deflation yeah i don't
[2:56:59.520 --> 2:57:04.320]  like gold and real estate's going to deflate more than anything so it's better to keep your money in
[2:57:04.320 --> 2:57:10.560]  safe you know low yield safe bonds cash things but he's saying what about bail ins and looting what
[2:57:10.560 --> 2:57:15.280]  about government looting well to me the best thing to do is have your money in a brokerage
[2:57:15.280 --> 2:57:19.680]  account under your name not in a bank account things like that um what about getting a small
[2:57:19.680 --> 2:57:24.800]  farm and working with folks who know how to do it trying to you know that if you can produce something
[2:57:24.800 --> 2:57:31.440]  affordable and be more self-sufficient but farmland is also in a bubble believe me it's
[2:57:31.440 --> 2:57:35.280]  gone up seven to ten times in the lab so wait till that bus and then go into it if you know what
[2:57:35.280 --> 2:57:40.240]  you're doing i totally agree with that uh let's go ahead and talk to who's been holding the longest
[2:57:40.240 --> 2:57:48.320]  here let's talk to greg and michigan a quick question for mr den gentlemen uh mary christmas
[2:57:48.320 --> 2:57:53.920]  to y'all thank you harry i'm a big fan i read your first book in 1989 i think it was called the power
[2:57:53.920 --> 2:58:02.080]  trip predict yeah i think i read the great boom ahead in 2006 but i i'm still struggling with
[2:58:02.080 --> 2:58:09.280]  the idea that gold is a commodity when central banks are buying it hand over fist it's being
[2:58:09.280 --> 2:58:14.400]  manipulated manipulate on the comax it's a really a currency by the way people are treating it
[2:58:14.400 --> 2:58:18.160]  a lot great as a dual yes this is the one thing i'm not sure about i mean i think it's good to
[2:58:18.160 --> 2:58:23.520]  listen to what he's saying he's probably right at least the next five ten years but uh i don't know uh
[2:58:24.160 --> 2:58:26.240]  keep going with your question we're gonna come back and he'll answer it
[2:58:28.160 --> 2:58:33.520]  anything else uh no i think it's a currency all right i'll get him to answer that some stations

[3:00:03.280 --> 3:00:12.880]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[3:00:17.040 --> 3:00:20.560]  all right i'm gonna get to that last caller's question when mr dent the few minutes we have left
[3:00:20.560 --> 3:00:23.680]  with him and i'll try to then just ask some of the questions that i see up there on the board we
[3:00:23.680 --> 3:00:28.480]  may get to more too but i i played a clip where bush said hey you're you know you're not gonna get the
[3:00:28.480 --> 3:00:33.200]  nomination period and actually showed what this guy really looks like because the nice boy act with
[3:00:33.200 --> 3:00:39.680]  the bushes believe me folks it's just that a complete act these are hardcore people uh and this is how
[3:00:39.680 --> 3:00:44.640]  to see an end a quote of jev bush quote i can guarantee you donald trump is not going to be the
[3:00:44.640 --> 3:00:50.720]  nominee he added at the town hall in husk said so so these are his other quotes he said and
[3:00:51.280 --> 3:00:55.920]  mr dent was saying during the break harry dent was saying you know i don't get why he's so arrogant
[3:00:55.920 --> 3:01:00.400]  and thinks he's going to stay in when he's three percent because they brag they've got the delegates
[3:01:00.400 --> 3:01:05.600]  with the republican machine he got the biggest applause is because they let in his people that's
[3:01:05.600 --> 3:01:13.360]  how sickening this is uh mr dent your comments on that yeah i mean uh i feel like the whole
[3:01:13.360 --> 3:01:19.040]  political system's been hijacked by special interests lobbying and all this sort of stuff
[3:01:19.040 --> 3:01:25.120]  and again i mean over 50 of the contributions to campaigns this year have come from from
[3:01:25.120 --> 3:01:30.560]  like 30 families or something like that so so this thing this power behind the scenes that we
[3:01:30.560 --> 3:01:36.080]  really don't have democracy the central banks have taken over the free markets and and special
[3:01:36.080 --> 3:01:41.920]  interests and and and money has taken over democracy so i i do not like these trends when
[3:01:41.920 --> 3:01:45.680]  this sort of backroom stuff can happen you were telling me the reason you like bloomberg is and
[3:01:45.680 --> 3:01:48.400]  i've heard this from other folks that when you're in his offices it's the most happening
[3:01:48.960 --> 3:01:53.280]  jumping hard working place you've ever seen it is the most but the main reason
[3:01:53.280 --> 3:01:58.160]  and i was for romney back last time because we need a turnaround manager the economy's
[3:01:58.160 --> 3:02:02.640]  going to fail and we need somebody to say okay in failure we need i used to be a turnaround
[3:02:02.640 --> 3:02:08.000]  manager that's what we did at bayonet company you you you come in and you reassess stuff and you
[3:02:08.000 --> 3:02:11.840]  make radical changes and you can only make such radical changes when things are what do you think
[3:02:11.840 --> 3:02:17.440]  a fear arena sort of person uh she's i mean i i remember following it did you just manage
[3:02:17.440 --> 3:02:22.160]  a takeover and kind of eluding i mean i don't know what a great lady she was she just took the
[3:02:22.160 --> 3:02:26.080]  company and merged it with another one i don't i don't get it yeah well you know i think they're
[3:02:26.080 --> 3:02:30.320]  they're understating the good i think she walked in a difficult situation but you know she does not
[3:02:30.320 --> 3:02:36.480]  have a tracker to say i can turn something around michael bloomberg i think or a mit romney would be
[3:02:36.480 --> 3:02:41.040]  that type of well i like my romney a lot better than hillary clinton bloomberg and the gun thing
[3:02:41.040 --> 3:02:44.080]  that's just a veto there but i appreciate your view on that and i've heard it from other smart
[3:02:44.080 --> 3:02:49.280]  people that bloomberg is a smart cookie uh he just wants to enslave me when he has bodyguards so he
[3:02:49.280 --> 3:02:54.880]  can go right to hell in my view uh let's get into that whole question about gold is it a commodity
[3:02:54.880 --> 3:03:00.640]  or is it a currency okay it was a currency up to the early 70s it no longer is you can't take a
[3:03:00.640 --> 3:03:05.200]  kuga randana store and buy something or buy an airline ticket or something like that or or even
[3:03:05.760 --> 3:03:11.840]  you know take it overseas with you um it is a potential currency again but there's not enough
[3:03:11.840 --> 3:03:16.560]  gold in the world olympic-sized swimming pool would hold all the gold world how do you back
[3:03:16.560 --> 3:03:21.760]  a global economy that's so many times bigger and growing so much faster than gold supply is so
[3:03:22.320 --> 3:03:26.320]  gold used to be a good backing i don't see it be an occurrence but my problem is they can then
[3:03:26.320 --> 3:03:31.280]  manipulate that with fractional reserve banking again well i mean again i think gold's a great
[3:03:31.280 --> 3:03:36.400]  thing to have in a basket of backups uh i just people that just think it's going to absolutely
[3:03:36.400 --> 3:03:41.360]  save them forever uh i mean i think it's just part of a larger plant but the question you have to
[3:03:41.360 --> 3:03:46.320]  ask yourself we have printed more money than anytime in history no i even i nobody would have
[3:03:46.320 --> 3:03:52.400]  expected this much 10 trillion minimum around the world and gold continues to fall gold they admit
[3:03:52.400 --> 3:03:56.240]  there's it was their naked shorting it would be against that they admit they're driving it down
[3:03:56.240 --> 3:04:00.480]  though that's come out just like libor and all of it yeah but they're manipulating all markets the
[3:04:00.480 --> 3:04:06.080]  stock markets you know still going up in certain things gold i'm telling you it's i think the
[3:04:06.080 --> 3:04:12.240]  truth is in between what you say and then what somebody like peter schiff says i mean i don't
[3:04:12.240 --> 3:04:16.400]  think gold is as bad as you say or silver but i do see the manipulation and i do agree with you
[3:04:16.400 --> 3:04:20.400]  about deflation but i mean down the road i don't know how they're going to suppress the price
[3:04:20.400 --> 3:04:24.320]  plus it's industrial use but again the peter schiffs have been saying and consistently say
[3:04:24.320 --> 3:04:29.520]  the dollar's going to go to zero and gold's going to go to five thousand this is not happening mark

[3:08:21.360 --> 3:08:25.200]  this hour joining me in the studio right now is leann macadoo we're going to talk a little bit
[3:08:25.200 --> 3:08:32.400]  about last night's debate of course as we saw chris christie uh getting on his doctor strange
[3:08:32.400 --> 3:08:37.360]  love talking about what he would do to russia if they uh flew in a country where they've been
[3:08:37.360 --> 3:08:43.360]  invited by by syria to uh patrol there as well as by iran neighboring countries uh saying yeah
[3:08:43.360 --> 3:08:47.200]  i would shoot him down we're going to assert ourselves into this country and we're going to
[3:08:47.200 --> 3:08:54.800]  shoot down the russians absolutely insane ran paul uh called him on that insanity uh but at the
[3:08:54.800 --> 3:09:01.440]  same time they were doing that we had the f a a come out and say they're going to turn america
[3:09:01.440 --> 3:09:05.360]  into a no fly zone of course we've got the list where people can't fly on planes i'm not talking
[3:09:05.360 --> 3:09:10.080]  about that not talking about the star chamber lists i'm talking about the fact that the f a a
[3:09:10.080 --> 3:09:16.400]  has now given themselves the authority to say that if you fly a drone and by that they mean
[3:09:16.400 --> 3:09:20.000]  anything that is a half pound and up that's something that'll fit in the palm of your hand
[3:09:20.560 --> 3:09:25.360]  they take it upon themselves give you a civil fine of 27 500 dollars now of course that's a
[3:09:25.360 --> 3:09:30.720]  civil fine so they don't even have to take you to court give you any due process because they
[3:09:30.720 --> 3:09:35.840]  called it civil if they want to come after you with a criminal uh charge they can get up to a
[3:09:35.840 --> 3:09:40.080]  quarter of a million dollars so i'm going to talk about that at the bottom of the hour but i want
[3:09:40.080 --> 3:09:46.880]  to uh ask lienne about her take on the debate last night lienne what'd you think well wow just
[3:09:46.880 --> 3:09:50.160]  speaking on that f a a ruling that's pretty incredible because think about all the parents
[3:09:50.160 --> 3:09:54.400]  that are going to be buying those little drones for their you know sucking stuffers and things
[3:09:54.400 --> 3:09:59.360]  like that so make sure you get those registered um but register your children register their toys
[3:10:00.400 --> 3:10:04.880]  everything because the government's got a list who's not in ice and they're checking well actually
[3:10:05.600 --> 3:10:09.680]  one of our guys was just in there having to do a software update for our drone it wouldn't even
[3:10:09.680 --> 3:10:15.360]  work and so there you go i mean see they can that's the whole point they can put gps fencing and to
[3:10:15.360 --> 3:10:20.000]  keep these things away from the airports but no they want to take the route where they can control
[3:10:20.000 --> 3:10:24.960]  you the most right or just shut your drone down as it's registered well um obviously i think the
[3:10:24.960 --> 3:10:29.680]  debate was pretty spectacular last night and i enjoyed covering it once again i think it was
[3:10:29.680 --> 3:10:34.880]  the third most watched debate ever so i'm pretty happy to know that there are a lot of people tuning
[3:10:34.880 --> 3:10:40.000]  in paying attention getting involved in politics at this point even though they're really trying to
[3:10:40.000 --> 3:10:46.320]  dumb us down um but i wanted to go ahead and play ran paul's opening statements because we
[3:10:46.320 --> 3:10:51.120]  kind of got to our live coverage a little bit late so we we missed it yeah he was the very first one
[3:10:51.120 --> 3:10:55.920]  to speak and introduce and we got only the tail end of it where he reminded everybody that it was
[3:10:55.920 --> 3:11:00.560]  the anniversary of the bill of rights right and he's he just came out swinging like hey you're
[3:11:00.560 --> 3:11:04.480]  running for president well there's this little thing called the constitution let me remind
[3:11:04.480 --> 3:11:10.000]  you about it let's go ahead and play that clip the question is how do we keep america safe from
[3:11:10.000 --> 3:11:17.840]  terrorism trump says we ought to close that internet thing the question really is what does he mean by
[3:11:17.840 --> 3:11:24.880]  that they do in north korea like they do in china rubio says we should collect all americans records
[3:11:24.880 --> 3:11:32.320]  all of the time the constitution says otherwise i think they're both wrong i think we defeat terrorism
[3:11:32.320 --> 3:11:40.000]  by showing them that we do not fear them i think if we ban certain religions if we censor the internet
[3:11:40.720 --> 3:11:47.760]  i think that at that point the terrorists will have won regime change hasn't won toppling secular
[3:11:47.760 --> 3:11:53.360]  dictators in the middle east has only led to chaos and the rise of radical islam i think if
[3:11:53.360 --> 3:12:00.400]  we want to defeat terrorism i think if we truly are sincere about defeating terrorism we need to
[3:12:00.400 --> 3:12:06.800]  quit arming the allies of isis if we want to defeat terrorism the boots on the ground the
[3:12:06.800 --> 3:12:12.480]  boots on the ground need to be error boots on the ground as commander in chief i will do whatever
[3:12:12.480 --> 3:12:19.840]  it takes to defend america but in defending america we cannot lose what america stands for
[3:12:20.720 --> 3:12:25.520]  today is the bill of rights anniversary i hope we will remember that and cherish that in the fight
[3:12:25.520 --> 3:12:29.680]  on terrorism thank you senator he couldn't have a better opening he hit all the points and we
[3:12:29.680 --> 3:12:37.600]  have to understand that america is is more than uh just borders america is fundamentally the idea
[3:12:37.600 --> 3:12:43.200]  that the government's purpose is to protect our rights and you don't hear any other candidate
[3:12:43.200 --> 3:12:48.000]  talking about rights about liberty about the bill of rights except for ram paul he clearly
[3:12:48.000 --> 3:12:52.000]  understands what's going on and he clearly understands that even though they spent all
[3:12:52.000 --> 3:12:56.160]  last night talking about how they're going to go to war with isis how they're going to contain isis
[3:12:56.160 --> 3:13:02.000]  he clearly understands and will openly say it that we are the ones who are creating this problem
[3:13:02.000 --> 3:13:06.960]  right we created isis we fund it and we continue to fund it stop accidentally dropping weapons
[3:13:06.960 --> 3:13:12.320]  to isis and stop buying their oil arming the so-called moderate rebels who turn out to be
[3:13:12.320 --> 3:13:18.400]  jihadis joining isis yeah so yeah i mean he called it came out swinging with that um so i
[3:13:18.400 --> 3:13:22.960]  wanted to go ahead and talk a little bit about trump shutting down the internet so he sort of
[3:13:22.960 --> 3:13:27.600]  clarified a little bit last night in the debate donald trump said you know he wasn't talking about
[3:13:27.600 --> 3:13:32.320]  shutting down the internet websites he was specifically talking about geography and so
[3:13:32.320 --> 3:13:38.320]  shutting down uh the places where isis is um accessing the internet and things like that and
[3:13:38.880 --> 3:13:44.640]  this article um comes from breitbart here's why trump is right about shutting down parts of the
[3:13:44.640 --> 3:13:49.600]  internet and so the author kind of dumps it down for those of us who don't really understand all of
[3:13:49.600 --> 3:13:55.360]  this technical jargon um like myself uh but here i'll just read in theory he says all president
[3:13:55.360 --> 3:14:00.720]  trump would have to do is have the FCC exercise its regulatory authority over telecommunications
[3:14:00.720 --> 3:14:04.800]  infrastructure oh they want to do that very hard yes they're trying to do that very hard yeah they're
[3:14:04.800 --> 3:14:09.680]  going to arrange to make announcements for the ip addresses that are owned by islamic state any
[3:14:09.680 --> 3:14:15.040]  traffic intended for islamic state on about 95 percent of the internet could be redirected to
[3:14:15.040 --> 3:14:21.280]  the u.s. and then null routed essentially dumping it into a black hole perhaps after being analyzed
[3:14:21.280 --> 3:14:27.440]  by the nsa or the military problem solved well you know it isn't an issue uh leon of how the
[3:14:27.440 --> 3:14:33.040]  technology is going to work and of course what he tries to do here is to sound like he knows something
[3:14:33.600 --> 3:14:38.560]  by using a few technical terms i'm not impressed by jargon okay i've been an engineer i see how
[3:14:38.560 --> 3:14:42.880]  people use this i've seen with the climate debate how people use appeals to authority trust me i'm
[3:14:42.880 --> 3:14:48.800]  a phd whatever he made some pretty amazingly ridiculous things uh statements in here he said
[3:14:48.800 --> 3:14:52.560]  all the internet service providers that together comprise the core the internet are all american
[3:14:52.560 --> 3:14:57.360]  well that's actually not true they're internet service providers in every single country and
[3:14:57.360 --> 3:15:03.440]  which is why china is able to exactly that's where we're headed with this uh is to um emulate
[3:15:03.440 --> 3:15:08.720]  what china is doing with their great firewall and so it's not a question of pragmatics it's
[3:15:08.720 --> 3:15:13.360]  not a question of how the technology works so yeah you can do anything with the technology you can
[3:15:13.360 --> 3:15:18.480]  completely shut down the internet you can do it with uh you know rubber hose and guns in people's
[3:15:18.480 --> 3:15:23.760]  faces or you can do it finesse with uh technology the issue is the principles the issue is free
[3:15:23.760 --> 3:15:28.480]  speech which this guy is clearly clueless about who's writing for breitbart he really doesn't
[3:15:28.480 --> 3:15:33.360]  understand it but you know leon as this was the beta is going on as we were talking about that
[3:15:33.360 --> 3:15:40.400]  yesterday there was a conference in china promoting the chinese ideal of censorship and let me read
[3:15:40.400 --> 3:15:46.560]  to you for what fortune magazine said they said china is selling a censored walled off internet
[3:15:47.280 --> 3:15:51.920]  they want the there's a world conference uh china's world conference that began yesterday they said
[3:15:51.920 --> 3:15:58.720]  it's a total farce it's an event where china hopes to use its speech to spread the idea of censorship
[3:15:58.720 --> 3:16:04.880]  okay an internet that's walled off from the world to censorship and firewalls and they talk about how
[3:16:04.880 --> 3:16:09.200]  they've banned facebook they've banned twitter wordpress instagram they used to ban google but
[3:16:09.200 --> 3:16:15.360]  now google has a kowtow literally to what china wants to do so now they're allowed in the human
[3:16:15.360 --> 3:16:21.840]  rights activists the internet activists everybody knows precisely what china is doing they are
[3:16:21.840 --> 3:16:29.200]  exercising what they call their sovereignty in the name of security and safety okay why did they
[3:16:29.200 --> 3:16:35.520]  do this well they had a train accident back in 2011 in one of the cities and the chinese government
[3:16:35.520 --> 3:16:41.120]  wanted to float this false narrative about what had happened with the train accident and it scared
[3:16:41.120 --> 3:16:47.520]  them to death because the truth came out on social media it's a threat to china it's not a threat to
[3:16:47.520 --> 3:16:51.680]  the chinese people to have free speech it's a threat to the chinese government it's a threat to
[3:16:51.680 --> 3:16:56.080]  tyrants to have free speech that's why it's the very first thing that is enumerated in the bill
[3:16:56.080 --> 3:17:00.880]  of rights is free speech all the internet groups all the technical people all the human rights groups
[3:17:00.880 --> 3:17:05.440]  recognize that what china is doing is censorship and what donald trump is calling about in terms of
[3:17:05.440 --> 3:17:08.880]  just well we're just going to cut off this part of the internet and we're going to wall off that
[3:17:08.880 --> 3:17:13.360]  area over there he's he wants to put a bore a wall at the border thinks he can keep people out with
[3:17:13.360 --> 3:17:18.800]  that he thinks he can shut down terrorism with a great firewall just like china it isn't going to
[3:17:18.800 --> 3:17:23.280]  work in any place well and as we've seen you know given inch they're going to take a mile there you
[3:17:23.280 --> 3:17:29.200]  set the precedent that they can shut down internet access in one area well they've already ignored
[3:17:29.200 --> 3:17:34.240]  islamic terror threat before sambert indino to focus on right wing radicals so those people were
[3:17:34.240 --> 3:17:39.840]  able to slip to the cracks because this administration thinks that those are not the terrorists the
[3:17:39.840 --> 3:17:44.560]  real terrorists are these right wing radicals and that's the point the conservatives always sell
[3:17:44.560 --> 3:17:48.800]  this to the right wing because they're going to buy into the idea of safety they're the ones who love
[3:17:48.800 --> 3:17:53.200]  what course the left does as well they all want safety nobody cares about liberty anymore and then
[3:17:53.200 --> 3:17:57.040]  you have to understand that the southern poverty law center and the government are constantly
[3:17:57.040 --> 3:18:01.520]  constantly we report on this virtually weekly how they say you know the real threat to america
[3:18:01.520 --> 3:18:09.120]  is not islamic terrorism please don't be scared of the muslims okay be afraid of the uh the uh
[3:18:09.120 --> 3:18:14.160]  conservatives okay the homegrown conservatives who don't like the government that's your real
[3:18:14.160 --> 3:18:18.160]  enemy and folks what they're going to do is they're going to shut down conservative libertarian
[3:18:18.160 --> 3:18:22.640]  media with us you give them this tool and that's the way they're going to hammer it and that's
[3:18:22.640 --> 3:18:26.080]  what people need to understand because a lot of people even in the comment section were like what
[3:18:26.080 --> 3:18:31.200]  do you prefer info wars you just think that they should leave the internet open and and not and so
[3:18:31.200 --> 3:18:36.800]  that's it's like you've got to pay attention to this because this is what they use isis to stir
[3:18:36.800 --> 3:18:41.120]  our everyone up into fear so that we will give give up our rights even though everyone knows
[3:18:41.120 --> 3:18:46.480]  and we've been fighting for this free and open internet that's why um the new world orders had
[3:18:46.480 --> 3:18:51.840]  to really ramp up its plans because the internet gives people all over the world access to truth
[3:18:51.840 --> 3:18:57.680]  or over 14 years into this patriot act idiocy okay are you safer we've had bigger terrorist
[3:18:57.680 --> 3:19:03.680]  attack than we ever had outside of uh what they did at 9 11 with this most recent one and of course
[3:19:03.680 --> 3:19:07.680]  we're told that you know they knew all about them but you know they were just watching them look
[3:19:07.680 --> 3:19:12.960]  i have no problem with with them surveilling people uh if they're foreigners that's what the foreign
[3:19:12.960 --> 3:19:18.160]  intelligence surveillance act act was for i have a problem with them surveilling americans without a

[3:24:07.200 --> 3:24:11.280]  welcome back to the alexio show i'm david knight and join me now in the studio as leon macadam
[3:24:11.280 --> 3:24:17.120]  we're going to talk about the back and forth between rubio and ran paul about the immigration
[3:24:17.120 --> 3:24:21.520]  bill who wants to open the borders how do they want to uh or do they even want to try to control
[3:24:21.520 --> 3:24:28.240]  immigration i would say that rubio clearly does not he's worked on these bills with chuck schumer
[3:24:28.240 --> 3:24:33.280]  co-sponsored one and talk to the audience about the gang of eight define that a little bit for
[3:24:33.280 --> 3:24:39.520]  people leon well also too let's not forget that jeb bush publicly endorsed the the gang of eight
[3:24:39.520 --> 3:24:45.120]  msd bill so you know i thought it was hilarious when donald trump called him out on uh his brother
[3:24:45.120 --> 3:24:50.880]  flying bin laden family out right after 9 11 yes that was perfect that was perfect right and then and
[3:24:50.880 --> 3:24:54.960]  of course jeb's response was well you're not a serious candidate if you know if you pull back
[3:24:54.960 --> 3:25:00.080]  the curtain and uh show that the emperor has no clothes and you're not a serious candidate now
[3:25:00.080 --> 3:25:05.360]  you're real serious when you do that sort of thing right so the senate gang of eight immigration
[3:25:05.360 --> 3:25:12.480]  bill um it was written to provide a path to citizen citizenship um the dream act as well the family
[3:25:12.480 --> 3:25:18.640]  visas that would move along that backlog a lot faster um and then of course enforcement so they
[3:25:18.640 --> 3:25:25.520]  would you know add even more people there for this border surge and everything and at the time
[3:25:25.520 --> 3:25:30.160]  marco rubio he doubled down on this failed gang of eight bill they said hypothetical do over would
[3:25:30.160 --> 3:25:36.800]  you do this again and he said absolutely he would push for these same policies and he basically said
[3:25:36.800 --> 3:25:42.160]  that he was right in predicting that failure to pass a comprehensive immigration reform bill
[3:25:42.160 --> 3:25:48.160]  would result in executive action from the president so pass this to find out what's in it or else we're
[3:25:48.160 --> 3:25:51.920]  going to get executive so that i mean that and what that recently called them a gang was because
[3:25:51.920 --> 3:25:56.960]  this is a bipartisan movement of republican democrat senators to basically shut down any
[3:25:56.960 --> 3:26:01.200]  amendments any uh any pushback against that and that's part of what they were going back and forth
[3:26:01.200 --> 3:26:05.280]  about was the amendments that have been shut down and and remember who was in this of course it was
[3:26:05.280 --> 3:26:10.240]  Chuck Schumer the guy who uh uh wants to take your guns okay always that's one of the key places
[3:26:10.240 --> 3:26:16.960]  where he hangs out it was john mccain lindsay graham marco rubio okay so you know keep those names
[3:26:16.960 --> 3:26:21.760]  in mind okay those are the people who want to have uncontrolled immigration in our country and we
[3:26:21.760 --> 3:26:26.240]  know it was really behind that and we can see it what what's happening in europe is this is a way
[3:26:26.240 --> 3:26:32.000]  to take down country's sovereignty uh to also manipulate the voter rolls and so exactly why
[3:26:32.000 --> 3:26:36.640]  we don't need an id to vote you don't even need to be a citizen so obviously the this gang of eight
[3:26:36.640 --> 3:26:43.520]  bill was going to have major changes to our immigration system um but i ran paul once again
[3:26:43.520 --> 3:26:48.240]  i thought he hit it out of the park with this or he called out marco rubio for having more
[3:26:48.240 --> 3:26:54.800]  allegiance to chuck schumer and the democrats than he does to conservative principles so let's go
[3:26:54.800 --> 3:26:59.120]  ahead and play that clip or to the rule the other thing is is the one thing that might have stopped
[3:26:59.120 --> 3:27:03.600]  senator bernadino that might have stopped 9 11 would have been stricter controls on those who came
[3:27:03.600 --> 3:27:09.760]  here and marco has opposed at every point increased security border security for those who come to our
[3:27:09.760 --> 3:27:15.840]  country on his gang of eight bill he would have liberalized immigration but he did not and he
[3:27:15.840 --> 3:27:22.880]  steadfastly opposed any new border security requirements for refugees or students last week
[3:27:22.880 --> 3:27:28.080]  i introduced another bill saying we need more security we want more scrutiny once again marco
[3:27:28.080 --> 3:27:33.280]  opposed this so marco can't have it both ways he thinks he wants to be this oh i'm great and strong
[3:27:33.280 --> 3:27:38.400]  on national defense but he's the weakest of all the candidates on immigration he is the one for an
[3:27:38.400 --> 3:27:43.360]  open border that is leaving us defenseless if we want to defend the country we have to defend against
[3:27:43.360 --> 3:27:48.800]  who's are coming in and marco is has more of an allegiance to chuck schumer and to the liberals
[3:27:48.800 --> 3:27:55.840]  than he does to conservative policy okay so i mean that's good you know you can't have both
[3:27:55.840 --> 3:28:02.080]  liberty and i mean you you you have to have liberty and security and they're trying to have us give
[3:28:02.080 --> 3:28:06.400]  up our liberty for safety you know that was the drinking game you know i understand i understand
[3:28:06.400 --> 3:28:12.320]  a lot of libertarians who are concerned about border patrols border controls in in general
[3:28:12.320 --> 3:28:16.480]  and i understand that i mean we had a situation in this country where our borders were open for
[3:28:16.480 --> 3:28:22.480]  you know most of the of the life of the republic until we became an empire but you have to understand
[3:28:22.480 --> 3:28:27.600]  that the problem with that is the welfare state and now we have the problem of the radicalized
[3:28:27.600 --> 3:28:33.040]  jihadis that our cia and our dark side of our government has created and so both of those things
[3:28:33.040 --> 3:28:37.680]  make an open border not possible right now but i am very concerned about building a wall because
[3:28:37.680 --> 3:28:41.840]  we have to understand that if you build a wall that wall can be used to keep you in as ron paul has
[3:28:41.840 --> 3:28:47.440]  famously said as george washington said when people said you talk about uh uh freedom as if
[3:28:47.440 --> 3:28:51.280]  americans are no ones who have freedom don't the british people have freedom and he says yeah they
[3:28:51.280 --> 3:28:56.160]  have liberty but they walk about between high walls right in other words they are in a prison
[3:28:56.160 --> 3:29:00.640]  okay exactly and we don't want to build a prison for ourselves either in cyberspace
[3:29:00.640 --> 3:29:06.240]  or in literal space uh that's that's the thing that really concerns me so we have to temper
[3:29:06.240 --> 3:29:12.080]  uh anything that we do with making the uh establishment of individual liberty the prime
[3:29:12.080 --> 3:29:16.640]  issue because otherwise if we don't and we go down this road of national sovereignty
[3:29:16.640 --> 3:29:21.600]  that can quickly turn into a kind of fascism very easily and you were very quick to point
[3:29:21.600 --> 3:29:27.680]  all that out last night can we play 30 seconds of that last clip i don't know my favorite
[3:29:27.680 --> 3:29:33.280]  highlight uh you can run a little bit of it go ahead we'll go out with this
[3:29:36.640 --> 3:29:40.000]  i guess they don't have they don't have a hold up but that's all right yeah that's what you
[3:29:40.000 --> 3:29:44.480]  pointed out it's about freedom thank you leon we'll be right back and i'm going to talk about this
[3:29:44.480 --> 3:29:50.880]  uh new encroachment on our freedom that is absolutely we're on the march the empires on the run
[3:29:51.680 --> 3:29:54.560]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[3:30:02.800 --> 3:30:09.120]  that's right the feds are coming to town the f a a has just sent their dictate throughout the land
[3:30:09.120 --> 3:30:14.880]  any motorized planes heavier than a half pound i repeat a half pound will have to be registered
[3:30:14.880 --> 3:30:20.560]  by december 21st if santa gives you one you can't fly it outside without registering it on their
[3:30:20.560 --> 3:30:28.160]  list fail to do so and the f a a will find you $27,500 without due process calling it a civil
[3:30:28.160 --> 3:30:33.600]  fine if they come after you criminally quarter of a million dollars and three years in jail
[3:30:33.600 --> 3:30:38.560]  for not registering your half pound and heavier plane this regulation won't do anything to enforce
[3:30:38.560 --> 3:30:43.120]  the current prohibitions of flying close to airports and they should be concerned if they
[3:30:43.120 --> 3:30:48.080]  can't protect airports from toy planes because that means they certainly can't protect airports
[3:30:48.080 --> 3:30:54.240]  from shoulder fired missiles and guess what the jihadis won't be registering those with the f a a

[3:33:20.240 --> 3:33:24.960]  live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[3:33:29.680 --> 3:33:34.080]  welcome back to the alex joe show i'm david night your host i want to talk about what's going on
[3:33:34.080 --> 3:33:40.960]  with this insane expansion power grab of the f a a it's very parallel actually to what's going on
[3:33:40.960 --> 3:33:46.880]  with the fcc and i want to talk about these parallels because we need to understand that
[3:33:46.880 --> 3:33:51.600]  what we saw sold to us last night and i think one of the persons who does this the most is
[3:33:51.600 --> 3:33:58.880]  ted cruise uh donald trump is much better at pointing out that this has been going on a long
[3:33:58.880 --> 3:34:03.920]  time going back to bush administration most of these big problems that we're faced with right
[3:34:03.920 --> 3:34:08.000]  now of course we've had this has been going on far longer than that and that is the out of control
[3:34:08.000 --> 3:34:14.240]  bureaucracy as well as the policies that we've been pursuing abroad but we're told constantly
[3:34:14.240 --> 3:34:19.440]  by ted cruise that this is something that obama has done that hillary will continue and as long as we
[3:34:19.440 --> 3:34:23.200]  get rid of obama and don't elect hillary everything is just going to be fine no it isn't
[3:34:23.840 --> 3:34:29.440]  there are some horrible systemic issues with the federal government especially with the bureaucracy
[3:34:29.440 --> 3:34:35.040]  that persist regardless of who is elected and that's why we need to not get overly distracted by
[3:34:35.040 --> 3:34:40.320]  presidential election we need to make sure that we stay focused on the things that we can do
[3:34:40.320 --> 3:34:45.840]  to contain the federal government because it will not contain itself we need to take back our
[3:34:45.840 --> 3:34:50.800]  liberties and there are ways that we can do that without picking up a gun right now but our windows
[3:34:50.800 --> 3:34:55.440]  are starting to close and so we need to educate people about what they can do with jury nullification
[3:34:55.440 --> 3:35:00.400]  about what can be done at the state and local level to nullify the effect of the federal government
[3:35:00.400 --> 3:35:05.360]  when it steps into places that it has absolutely no authority so we're going to talk about that
[3:35:05.360 --> 3:35:10.000]  before we do real quickly i want to tell you about our specials we have free shipping all this

[3:36:09.040 --> 3:36:13.040]  out a couple of quick news articles we mentioned one of them briefly we're talking about the gang of
[3:36:13.040 --> 3:36:18.320]  eight uh the fact that that included not only marco rubio and lindsay graham who are running for
[3:36:18.320 --> 3:36:24.480]  president but also john mccain and john mccain uh has pointed out on drudge report that he now has
[3:36:24.480 --> 3:36:29.920]  somebody who is going to be challenging him for his seat arizona state senator kelly ward
[3:36:29.920 --> 3:36:35.840]  uh she is a physician in arizona she says she's resigning her senate seat to devote all of her
[3:36:35.840 --> 3:36:40.880]  energy to defeating mccain of course he's been there for five terms and my question that i jotted
[3:36:40.880 --> 3:36:48.400]  down on this as well will the tea party darling sarah palin once again uh stumped for him putting
[3:36:48.400 --> 3:36:53.200]  her pals over her principles and that's what we've seen her do in the past when there was some real
[3:36:53.200 --> 3:36:58.800]  credible uh threat to get rid of this very very dangerous man i mean another guy just like chris
[3:36:58.800 --> 3:37:05.360]  christie belligerent and on the verge of insanity in terms of his militancy the things that he would
[3:37:05.360 --> 3:37:11.200]  do for the military industrial complex just as we saw chris christie last night a jaw dropping
[3:37:11.200 --> 3:37:16.800]  admission that he would uh make declarations over syria and shoot down russian planes if they
[3:37:16.800 --> 3:37:21.680]  violate it because you know he he can draw the line anywhere he wishes that's the kind of authoritarian
[3:37:21.680 --> 3:37:29.280]  uh guy he is of course he's he's hopelessly in love with the war on drugs he's prosecuted people
[3:37:29.280 --> 3:37:36.080]  for it he says he's going to uh come after people in the states uh like uh colorado washington oregon
[3:37:36.080 --> 3:37:41.680]  where they have uh gotten rid of drug prohibition for marijuana you know because that's the way
[3:37:41.680 --> 3:37:46.400]  authoritarian's role just like he said he would tell russia what to do and he would start world
[3:37:46.400 --> 3:37:51.600]  war three if they don't obey his orders well he's going to go into uh these states that have uh
[3:37:51.600 --> 3:37:56.000]  legalized marijuana for medical use for recreational use and he's going to start putting people in jail
[3:37:56.720 --> 3:38:02.720]  great now we were told that the republicans were going to oppose uh obama on climate change we
[3:38:02.720 --> 3:38:07.200]  heard a lot of really strong talk and of course they had the paris climate agreement was passed
[3:38:07.200 --> 3:38:13.280]  this last weekend it didn't take long for the republicans to cave here it is wednesday and
[3:38:13.280 --> 3:38:19.040]  they have now passed the money for obama to do what he wants to in terms of starting to hand out
[3:38:19.040 --> 3:38:24.240]  the cash to the crony capitalists as part of this climate deal and a victory for the obama
[3:38:24.240 --> 3:38:29.040]  administration the spending package released by congressional leaders on wednesday won't block
[3:38:29.040 --> 3:38:35.120]  american financial contributions to an international climate fund for poorer nations they say this
[3:38:35.120 --> 3:38:40.880]  legislation doesn't formally block money for the green climate fund so obama is expected to be able
[3:38:40.880 --> 3:38:44.960]  to use current discretionary funding streams to send american money to it now this is not what we
[3:38:44.960 --> 3:38:49.920]  were promised by the republicans during negotiations over an international climate deal the gop said
[3:38:49.920 --> 3:38:59.040]  it would work to block gfc that's the green climate fund uh and any omnibus bill unless the senate
[3:38:59.040 --> 3:39:04.400]  got a chance to vote on ratifying the climate agreement but it was just talk but here's the
[3:39:04.400 --> 3:39:09.280]  talk that they said here's one example of one republican congressman uh our senator from uh
[3:39:09.280 --> 3:39:14.240]  wyoming he said congress will weigh in on whatever comes out of the paris climate talks
[3:39:14.240 --> 3:39:18.160]  and the money that the president has requested as part of the budget yeah they weighed in
[3:39:18.160 --> 3:39:22.000]  they said here you can have it no strings attached no problem do whatever you want
[3:39:22.000 --> 3:39:26.400]  you know you're god and uh or your sees are depending on you know what you want to do if you
[3:39:26.400 --> 3:39:31.360]  want to make pronouncements about religion or if you want to go to war go ahead you can do whatever
[3:39:31.360 --> 3:39:35.440]  you want and the congress will not oppose you and you know who else they want to oppose they will
[3:39:35.440 --> 3:39:42.720]  not oppose the bureaucracy what we've seen happening with this insane law that the f a a has put out
[3:39:42.720 --> 3:39:49.680]  and they've given everybody a deadline of december the 21st what this is is nothing but another
[3:39:50.240 --> 3:39:55.600]  petty fogging bureaucracy granting itself authority that it doesn't have we've seen
[3:39:55.600 --> 3:40:00.960]  this with the fcc the fcc is trying to take control of the internet in total and and that's
[3:40:00.960 --> 3:40:05.600]  why i'm so sensitive to what donald trump is doing when he wants to replicate the patterns
[3:40:05.600 --> 3:40:11.360]  that are happening in china and of course this idiot uh from uh bright part he says uh
[3:40:11.360 --> 3:40:15.200]  well unless you're a total moron you understand that what donald trump is talking about his
[3:40:15.200 --> 3:40:20.720]  geography he's like if you're you are a total moron if you think the internet is limited to
[3:40:20.720 --> 3:40:24.720]  geography if you think people can't spoof where they're coming from you think they can't reroute
[3:40:24.720 --> 3:40:29.120]  stuff you don't even understand the technology and he writes this whole article talking about
[3:40:29.120 --> 3:40:35.600]  how it would work i don't care how it would work it shouldn't work just like i don't care about
[3:40:36.640 --> 3:40:41.120]  messing with the details of taking people's guns away if they're on the no fly list you
[3:40:41.120 --> 3:40:48.240]  shouldn't have a no fly list if people have done something wrong then you take them to trial you
[3:40:48.240 --> 3:40:55.520]  don't put them on a list and then start punishing them without due process that is incredibly idiotic
[3:40:55.520 --> 3:41:00.080]  moronic foolish we shouldn't be doing that sort of thing but let's get back to these bureaucracies
[3:41:00.720 --> 3:41:06.160]  the FCC came out and of course this is all focusing people get tied up with the details
[3:41:06.160 --> 3:41:11.360]  of net neutrality folks this isn't about net neutrality we could argue about net neutrality
[3:41:11.360 --> 3:41:15.120]  just like we could argue about free trade and the transatlantic and trans pacific partnerships
[3:41:15.760 --> 3:41:24.240]  those partnerships are not about trade it's about establishing a new overreaching control
[3:41:24.240 --> 3:41:29.440]  it's about a new organization about consolidating control into a global governance
[3:41:29.440 --> 3:41:34.320]  and these regulations all this going back and forth between the FCC commission and the
[3:41:36.240 --> 3:41:42.320]  the appeal judge that a panel of three judges are looking at this this is all simply about
[3:41:42.320 --> 3:41:46.880]  them asserting authority into a new area it doesn't really have anything to do with net
[3:41:46.880 --> 3:41:52.320]  neutrality the FCC has been on both sides of net neutrality understand that so it's not about net
[3:41:52.320 --> 3:41:57.760]  neutrality it's not about free trade it's about creating control for a new body and that is what
[3:41:57.760 --> 3:42:03.680]  the FAA is doing as well when the FCC let's I'm not finished with the FCC let's talk about how
[3:42:03.680 --> 3:42:09.920]  this came about first they came out and they had some net neutrality rulings and they were
[3:42:09.920 --> 3:42:17.040]  slapped down by a judge I said you don't have the right to try to regulate content you only have
[3:42:17.040 --> 3:42:22.480]  the right to regulate utilities you're created to allocate spectrum to say okay these people
[3:42:22.480 --> 3:42:26.240]  going to have this frequency on the radio and these are going to have these frequencies on
[3:42:26.240 --> 3:42:29.360]  television so we're going to allocate that we're going to have an auction we're going to put that
[3:42:29.360 --> 3:42:35.920]  off and and but now they're trying to regulate content on the internet so the F so the judge
[3:42:35.920 --> 3:42:39.280]  says you know you don't have authority to do that you're just there to regulate utilities so the
[3:42:39.280 --> 3:42:47.360]  FCC comes back and says okay we have now pronounced that the internet is a utility done done voila problem
[3:42:47.360 --> 3:42:53.200]  solved and of course the judges come back and say uh yeah okay okay you say it's a utility so now
[3:42:53.200 --> 3:42:59.680]  you can regulate it just that simple what we're seeing happening with the FAA is exactly the same
[3:42:59.680 --> 3:43:05.760]  thing and let me go back to how this started we had a situation where the FAA got angry with a guy
[3:43:05.760 --> 3:43:10.960]  who was a swiss citizen I believe his name is perker and I think he was in New York if my memory
[3:43:10.960 --> 3:43:14.800]  serves me correctly I'm just going off of memory on this I think he was in New York he was nevertheless
[3:43:15.680 --> 3:43:21.920]  he took some pictures with a very very lightweight styrofoam drone and they got upset about it and
[3:43:21.920 --> 3:43:27.360]  they find him because I think what the FAA was trying to do was they figured they had some low
[3:43:27.360 --> 3:43:32.400]  hanging fruit because they could come after a guy who was not an American citizen and he would not
[3:43:32.400 --> 3:43:36.560]  really fight them in court he would just roll over or go away and they could get a conviction I mean
[3:43:36.560 --> 3:43:40.400]  they've done this types of things when they encroached on the second amendment when they
[3:43:40.400 --> 3:43:45.600]  talked about remember the sawed-off shotgun laws and they had the guy that they were coming after
[3:43:45.600 --> 3:43:49.600]  he died and so they made a ruling about this even after guy died and there was nobody to
[3:43:49.600 --> 3:43:55.600]  argue his side of the case they made a ruling and then set a precedent on that so I think they
[3:43:55.600 --> 3:44:00.480]  thought they could do the same thing with this swiss citizen perker now what happened was when
[3:44:00.480 --> 3:44:04.880]  this went before a law judge he fought it he said no no no I'm not gonna you know have you
[3:44:04.880 --> 3:44:08.720]  imposed this fine on me maybe he wanted to come back to the United States or maybe he just understood
[3:44:08.720 --> 3:44:13.680]  principle because you know Americans don't seem to understand principle anymore but he fought it
[3:44:13.680 --> 3:44:21.040]  he went to a law judge that ruled in his favor and said that the FAA didn't have jurisdiction
[3:44:21.040 --> 3:44:26.240]  over model planes and he said that the FAA's position that they're taking would quote lead to the
[3:44:26.240 --> 3:44:32.720]  reasonable argument that a flight in the air for example of a paper aircraft or a toy balsa wood
[3:44:32.720 --> 3:44:39.200]  glider could subject the operator to the regulatory provisions of these new laws that they've put in
[3:44:39.200 --> 3:44:46.080]  place okay and so the NTSB so that's what the judge said he basically left and said you're
[3:44:46.080 --> 3:44:52.160]  going to try to regulate model planes you're the FAA you don't have the authority to regulate
[3:44:52.160 --> 3:44:57.120]  model planes so then the FAA appealed it they took it before the national transportation safety
[3:44:57.120 --> 3:45:03.120]  board and the NTSB panel of three judges here we are three judges again unelected unaccountable
[3:45:03.120 --> 3:45:11.440]  say no they can do that they can do that and so now what we have well now there's a let's go to
[3:45:11.440 --> 3:45:18.080]  that was November of last year let's go to August of this year and what we had was a lawyer
[3:45:18.080 --> 3:45:25.040]  out of Connecticut his name is Peter Sacks he's founded the drone pilots association and he is
[3:45:25.040 --> 3:45:32.880]  a critic of the FAA's power grab over drones over toy planes so what he did was he to illustrate
[3:45:32.880 --> 3:45:40.160]  the absurdity of this he got the agency to approve a powered paper airplane for commercial drone
[3:45:40.160 --> 3:45:46.480]  operations just to make a point and what he did was he sent this to the FAA and they actually
[3:45:46.480 --> 3:45:52.160]  with a straight face gave him a permit for this now let me tell you what this paper drone is
[3:45:53.200 --> 3:46:00.160]  it is a drone from power up toys 3.0 drone is about $50 it's sold by a toy company out of
[3:46:00.160 --> 3:46:06.480]  Israel they started with a Kickstarter campaign raised about $1.2 million they sold 120 000 units
[3:46:06.480 --> 3:46:12.960]  of the toy it is a toy okay very tiny paper airplane they say it won't even lift the camera
[3:46:12.960 --> 3:46:18.960]  the battery gives out in 10 minutes and then as they put it it is a child of the wind okay
[3:46:18.960 --> 3:46:23.600]  they thought the ruling of the FAA was hysterical because what they did was they gave this guy he
[3:46:23.600 --> 3:46:27.760]  applied for a permit said hey I'd like to use this for commercial use they he applied for the
[3:46:27.760 --> 3:46:33.600]  permit and they granted him permission to use this paper airplane and say yeah we really do have
[3:46:33.600 --> 3:46:39.920]  the authority to look at model airplanes and to regulate them because they had come out with
[3:46:39.920 --> 3:46:45.760]  regulations that said that if you're going to fly this you have to be a registered pilot got all
[3:46:45.760 --> 3:46:52.240]  kinds of of regulations in terms of who can fly these drones if it's done commercially and of
[3:46:52.240 --> 3:46:57.200]  course you have to have a licensed pilot and so he points out that even though they gave him permission
[3:46:57.200 --> 3:47:02.480]  now they've granted him permission to fly this $50 paper airplane with a little tiny motor that
[3:47:02.480 --> 3:47:07.680]  won't lift a camera the battery gives out in 10 minutes they granted him a operator permission
[3:47:07.680 --> 3:47:12.560]  but now because he's using it for commercial use he still needs to have a pilot who meets
[3:47:12.560 --> 3:47:18.320]  certification rules that the FAA just put on about a year ago and he even though this guy
[3:47:18.320 --> 3:47:25.440]  is an out of certification helicopter pilot he flew real helicopters he flew a jet ranger helicopter
[3:47:25.440 --> 3:47:33.200]  but now he would have to hire somebody to fly this paper airplane or he would be in violation
[3:47:33.200 --> 3:47:41.200]  of the FAA's rules now the FAA is not laughing tyrants everywhere don't have a sense of humor
[3:47:41.200 --> 3:47:45.920]  they don't have a sense of shame they don't have a sense of irony and they could care less
[3:47:46.560 --> 3:47:53.200]  what our rights are they could care less what the law is now what have they regulated they have
[3:47:53.200 --> 3:47:59.680]  told everybody that you've got until december the 21st and then if you are 13 years of age or older
[3:47:59.680 --> 3:48:04.560]  and then if the kid has this if he doesn't register they'll come after the parents of course
[3:48:04.560 --> 3:48:11.520]  but anything that is a half a pound up to 55 pounds you will have to register with the FAA
[3:48:12.240 --> 3:48:22.320]  if you do not register with the FAA you are allowable to having a $27,500 civil penalty now
[3:48:22.320 --> 3:48:27.840]  that civil word is very important that you understand that understand that when they talk
[3:48:27.840 --> 3:48:34.320]  about it being a civil penalty and not a criminal penalty that means they can assess that to you
[3:48:35.120 --> 3:48:40.080]  without having to give you any due process they say well the constitutionally talks about
[3:48:40.800 --> 3:48:47.840]  having due process if it's a criminal action okay so they just treat you as a criminal they
[3:48:47.840 --> 3:48:53.040]  assess the fines without charging with a crime they don't want to give you a day in court because
[3:48:53.040 --> 3:48:56.880]  they don't want to have to prove that you did anything wrong they don't want a jury to look at
[3:48:56.880 --> 3:49:01.120]  this and say well wait a minute we also have the besides the fifth and sixth amendment we also have
[3:49:01.120 --> 3:49:08.400]  the eighth amendment about excessive fines do you think it's excessive that your your child or you
[3:49:08.400 --> 3:49:16.400]  would be fined $27,500 simply because you did not register you haven't done anything wrong
[3:49:16.400 --> 3:49:23.040]  you simply flew this outside of your outside of a building in the outside not inside your house
[3:49:23.040 --> 3:49:28.320]  you took it outside you open it up on Christmas day you take it outside and you fly it if the FAA
[3:49:28.320 --> 3:49:34.400]  knows they can assess a $27,000 fine to you is that insane it gets even more insane because
[3:49:34.400 --> 3:49:38.080]  if you did something criminally and I don't know what they would consider to be criminal
[3:49:38.080 --> 3:49:46.560]  a $250,000 fine and imprisonment of up to three years in jail now you need to understand that
[3:49:46.560 --> 3:49:52.240]  they are capable of putting GPS locations they've already done this many drone manufacturers have
[3:49:52.240 --> 3:49:59.440]  already put GPS location inhibitors in their drones to make sure that they do not get within the FAA
[3:50:00.320 --> 3:50:04.640]  restricted area close to an airport they have restrictions and I forget how many miles it
[3:50:04.640 --> 3:50:08.960]  is you have to be away from an airport but that's very easily done with technology you
[3:50:08.960 --> 3:50:14.320]  get very easily keep these things from getting anywhere close to a an airport keep them from
[3:50:14.320 --> 3:50:20.560]  getting anywhere close to a certain elevation that's not a problem but they want to take
[3:50:20.560 --> 3:50:26.640]  the approach of the maximum control that's what our government always does and we need to understand
[3:50:27.360 --> 3:50:32.560]  that as I pointed out at the very beginning of this this is not something that is going to go away
[3:50:33.120 --> 3:50:39.840]  if we get rid of Obama and don't elect Hillary this is an out of control bureaucracy that grants
[3:50:39.840 --> 3:50:45.200]  itself permission just as we see the FCC doing it we see the FAA doing it they grant themselves
[3:50:45.200 --> 3:50:50.320]  permission they create the penalties they accuse you with their police they bring you before
[3:50:50.320 --> 3:50:53.680]  their court if you even get a day in court stay with us we're going to be right back

[3:55:06.640 --> 3:55:13.840]  days left to get it for guaranteed christmas delivery as i was talking about what the fAA is
[3:55:13.840 --> 3:55:19.680]  doing what the FCC is doing understand that as all this is happening what is our congress doing
[3:55:19.680 --> 3:55:23.680]  they're giving the green light to obama to do whatever he wants to with this climate change
[3:55:23.680 --> 3:55:28.640]  deal just as they told us well don't worry they didn't have any mandates in there that
[3:55:28.640 --> 3:55:33.680]  didn't enact any carbon taxes that are going to be paid to some international tribunal that was on
[3:55:33.680 --> 3:55:37.680]  the table folks that was part of the draft but no they're not going to do any of that obama wanted
[3:55:37.680 --> 3:55:42.880]  that but they're just going to go with voluntary stuff so guess who volunteered the GOP just rolled
[3:55:42.880 --> 3:55:48.640]  over and gave it to him just like they're rolling over and giving permission to all of these federal
[3:55:48.640 --> 3:55:54.880]  bureaucracies whether it's the EPA whether it's the FCC whether it's fAA allowing them to write law
[3:55:54.880 --> 3:55:59.200]  so congress doesn't do anything anymore i don't know why don't we just send these guys home all
[3:55:59.200 --> 3:56:04.160]  they're doing is feathering their nest they're supposed to write the laws we elect them to
[3:56:04.160 --> 3:56:09.200]  write the laws we're supposed to have representatives write the law but instead we have bureaucracies
[3:56:09.200 --> 3:56:15.120]  that persist regardless of who is president let me repeat that regardless of who is president
[3:56:15.120 --> 3:56:21.680]  these bureaucracies continue to persist and they metastasize like a cancer so now we got the fAA
[3:56:21.680 --> 3:56:26.240]  saying you got a half pound toy that you can fit the palm of your hand cost less than $50
[3:56:26.240 --> 3:56:30.240]  register it or we're going to if we catch you you've always got this hanging over your head they
[3:56:30.240 --> 3:56:34.400]  can use this as a weapon against anybody yeah you can ignore it okay figure that you're not
[3:56:34.400 --> 3:56:38.080]  going to get caught but they use this as a weapon and they can clamp you don't think they're going
[3:56:38.080 --> 3:56:45.920]  to do that look at what the EPA did to the fellow who built a little pond on his eight acres he
[3:56:45.920 --> 3:56:51.120]  none of the water went across the border of his property he created the pond he dug it out he
[3:56:51.120 --> 3:56:56.320]  filled it with water for his livestock for his kids they assessed fines against him of $37,500
[3:56:57.040 --> 3:57:03.600]  per day so if the EPA can do that to a guy in Montana with eight acres they can do that to
[3:57:03.600 --> 3:57:09.440]  you with your kids toy drone and of course the congress won't do anything to stop them so we
[3:57:09.440 --> 3:57:14.480]  have to stop them at the state level we have to stop them with jury trials we need to demand
[3:57:14.480 --> 3:57:19.840]  that they're not going to take our money and call it a civil action without giving us a jury trial
[3:57:19.840 --> 3:57:24.240]  folks we have to understand they're coming after our freedoms and they pretty much have
[3:57:24.240 --> 3:57:27.520]  knocked all the walls down it's kind of like we're at the Alamo most of the walls are down
[3:57:27.520 --> 3:57:33.760]  we're being shelled by Santa Ana but we can't give this up we may only have one wall left
[3:57:33.760 --> 3:57:37.440]  but we need to fight for the First Amendment we need to fight for the Second Amendment
[3:57:37.440 --> 3:57:42.320]  and we need to take this back and we need to say that we're not going to abandon the station
[3:57:43.360 --> 3:57:47.360]  now before we go and I just want to underscore this some of the guys wanted me to play this
[3:57:47.360 --> 3:57:51.680]  this is a clip from last night where I was essentially saying the same thing and then
[3:57:51.680 --> 3:57:55.760]  we're going to go out with this clip let you know that tonight is the info wars nightly news
[3:57:55.760 --> 3:57:59.600]  with jacari jackson seven central eight p.m. eastern let's run this clip and we'll go out with that
[3:58:00.240 --> 3:58:03.920]  exactly politician tells you that he's going to take away your freedom of speech
[3:58:03.920 --> 3:58:09.280]  believe him he's going to take it away right it's not a fantasy don't pretend they lie to you all
[3:58:09.280 --> 3:58:14.400]  the time don't lie to yourself about what a politician is going to do if he tells you he's
[3:58:14.400 --> 3:58:18.480]  a thief if he tells you he's going to steal your rights he's going to steal your damn rights
[3:58:23.440 --> 3:58:27.200]  don't believe that they're not going to do it when they tell you they're going to take it
[3:58:27.200 --> 3:58:44.960]  if it comes to your money or your rights they will do that
