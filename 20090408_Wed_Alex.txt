[00:00.000 --> 00:11.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.480 --> 00:19.040]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.040 --> 00:38.560]  Texas Alex Jones
[00:38.560 --> 00:44.640]  all right we've got to Michael bag Narek who was the presidential candidate for
[00:44.640 --> 00:51.360]  the Libertarian Party back in 2004 constitutional scholar just an amazing
[00:51.360 --> 00:54.640]  mind when it comes to the Bill of Rights Constitution Declaration of
[00:54.640 --> 01:00.640]  Independence Magna Carta a lawful system of rule of law versus the Napoleonic
[01:00.640 --> 01:04.560]  system receiving set up by the global crime syndicate right now he'll be
[01:04.560 --> 01:08.520]  joining us in the last hour today Stuart Rhodes is going to pop in in the third
[01:08.520 --> 01:13.520]  hour he started oath keepers it's a spinoff from the whole Ron Paul Liberty
[01:13.520 --> 01:17.360]  Committee movement he worked in the campaign and it's thousands and thousands
[01:17.360 --> 01:21.160]  of police and military have gone there and pledged on the site some publicly
[01:21.160 --> 01:25.280]  some you know through pseudonyms that they will protect and defend the
[01:25.280 --> 01:28.880]  Constitution Bill of Rights and they're going to be having rallies and other
[01:28.880 --> 01:34.720]  events around the country so a big update from him coming up okay that said
[01:34.720 --> 01:44.600]  this news story of the individual killing three cops and wounding two
[01:44.600 --> 01:50.120]  others up in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania's Saturday just gets bigger and bigger and
[01:50.120 --> 01:51.520]  bigger
[01:51.520 --> 01:55.720]  air America and we've confirmed this from two different sources and one of their
[01:55.720 --> 02:03.600]  host saying that basically I call for violence and said kill the cops so the
[02:03.600 --> 02:08.320]  libel the slander the defamation is entering whole new proportions here
[02:08.320 --> 02:16.400]  last week I was murdering talk show host and an Israeli agent this week it's not
[02:16.400 --> 02:20.440]  just that I supposedly had a listener who went out and did this it turns out
[02:20.440 --> 02:23.680]  didn't like me and attack me all over the web and now the newspapers have
[02:23.680 --> 02:27.960]  retracted the fact saying that he got the idea from me that doesn't matter
[02:27.960 --> 02:33.400]  though see now it's I'm actually telling people to go out and kill police you
[02:33.400 --> 02:38.240]  know I mean if I wanted to spend all my time suing people I could do it my gosh
[02:38.240 --> 02:47.560]  and it's just forcing me to because I mean if I don't punish people for what
[02:47.560 --> 02:51.320]  they're doing it'll say well it's fair game you know let's just say Alex
[02:51.320 --> 02:56.720]  Jones as a child molester next let's say he killed JFK killed Lincoln let's say
[02:56.720 --> 03:02.920]  he carried out 9-11 let's say Alex Jones shot Reagan let's say Alex Jones
[03:02.920 --> 03:09.120]  you know dumps toxic waste in the rivers Alex Jones is the boogeyman who
[03:09.120 --> 03:14.320]  hides under your bed at night now again this is ridiculous and it shows how
[03:14.320 --> 03:17.960]  desperate the establishment is who's lost all credibility I mean they've been
[03:17.960 --> 03:21.160]  saying for decades there's no world government no new world order no move
[03:21.160 --> 03:27.000]  to a global currency and now it's in every newspaper but simultaneously they've
[03:27.000 --> 03:32.680]  chosen me as the poster boy to say don't be like this nut it's crazy
[03:32.680 --> 03:38.960]  if you talk about the UN existing basically you're a cop killer so it's
[03:38.960 --> 03:42.240]  just getting crazier and crazier and I really thought about this this morning
[03:42.240 --> 03:46.320]  and I wrote a few notes here and I want to go over this but this is to be
[03:46.320 --> 03:50.880]  expected we are kicking the new world orders hind in right now their left
[03:50.880 --> 03:54.440]  right paradigm is shattered they're trying to create new paradigms new
[03:54.440 --> 04:00.800]  systems new subgroups new strata new constituencies for their baloney and
[04:00.800 --> 04:05.920]  it is it is not gonna work I mean here's an example I've seen mainstream news

[04:41.440 --> 04:46.680]  troops on the streets of America for crowd control and they write articles

[08:17.600 --> 08:25.200]  for a long time we've been saying the next target of stage terror will be
[08:25.200 --> 08:38.280]  North Africa Kenya Somalia and other areas those surrounding areas Sudan and
[08:38.280 --> 08:45.000]  sure enough you've got to the Somali pirates running around hijacking
[08:45.000 --> 08:55.200]  sea-jacking and commandeering free-booting pirating all over that area in some cases a
[08:55.200 --> 08:59.200]  couple hundred miles out and they're even grabbing you know well one of the
[08:59.200 --> 09:03.720]  biggest ships in the world they grabbed a big Saudi ship a few months ago that is
[09:03.720 --> 09:08.240]  one of the biggest ships in the world three times the size of the Titanic
[09:08.240 --> 09:14.240]  filled with oil worth I think they said like nine hundred million dollars or
[09:14.240 --> 09:20.800]  something conservatively so all of this is going on and they've now hijacked a
[09:20.800 --> 09:26.680]  ship with 20 Americans on board Somali pirates hijacked a u.s. flagged a Danish
[09:26.680 --> 09:30.760]  owned container ship on Wednesday with 20 American crew on board in the latest
[09:30.760 --> 09:37.920]  of a sharp rise in attacks on the Horn of Africa nation official said Andrew
[09:37.920 --> 09:46.080]  Maguire coordinator for the mom base based East African seafarers assistance
[09:46.080 --> 09:54.120]  program told Reuters at the 17,000 ton Alabama had been seized off the Mogadishu
[09:54.120 --> 09:58.640]  far out in the Indian Ocean but all its crew were believed to be safe well yeah
[09:58.640 --> 10:04.560]  they're gonna hold them for ransom Denmark's AP molar Masarik confirmed
[10:04.560 --> 10:12.440]  that the u.s. flagged Alabama had been attacked by pirates about 500 kilometers
[10:12.440 --> 10:16.080]  or 300 miles off Somalia and had probably been hijacked the company said
[10:16.080 --> 10:24.240]  that 20 American crew on board the Marzik Alabama is owned and operated by
[10:24.240 --> 10:31.120]  Marzik line limited a Norfolk Virginia base of city area of AP molar Masarik
[10:31.120 --> 10:35.760]  and the world's biggest container shiver and it just goes on a u.s. naval
[10:35.760 --> 10:41.280]  spokeswoman in Bahrain Lieutenant Stephanie Murdoch said a u.s. flagged
[10:41.280 --> 10:47.200]  Danish owned ship reported being attacked by pirates early on Wednesday
[10:47.200 --> 11:03.520]  about 280 miles southeast of Somalia last year heavily armed Somali pirates
[11:03.520 --> 11:07.560]  hijacked dozens of vessels took hundreds of sailors hostage often for
[11:07.560 --> 11:13.160]  weeks and extracted millions of dollars in ransoms and we had a well-known
[11:13.160 --> 11:18.440]  author and the captain who was who repelled an attack on his ship in the
[11:18.440 --> 11:24.200]  Caribbean we had him on a few months ago let's get that captain back on who was
[11:24.200 --> 11:27.400]  talking about how he believed you know pirating doubled last year he thinks
[11:27.400 --> 11:31.080]  it'll double this year and only about half the companies that get siege act
[11:31.080 --> 11:36.800]  they get free booted that get pirated that get to taken hostage report what's
[11:36.800 --> 11:39.480]  going on so it's probably far worse than that well there's no doubt it's far
[11:39.480 --> 11:43.040]  worse than what's being said so over the weekend they also seized a French
[11:43.040 --> 11:48.840]  yacht a Yemen tug and a 20,000 ton German container vessel Interfax news
[11:48.840 --> 11:56.040]  agency said the Hassan Stavanger had a German captain three Russians two
[11:56.040 --> 12:00.000]  Ukrainians and 14 Filipinos on board the pirates typically launched speed boats
[12:00.000 --> 12:06.080]  from other ships meaning they can sometimes evade warships patrolling
[12:06.080 --> 12:10.880]  for the strategic shipping lanes and strike far out to sea they then take
[12:10.880 --> 12:15.200]  captured vessels to remote coastal villages based in Somalia and they have
[12:15.200 --> 12:19.840]  usually targeted their hostages treat their hostages as well anticipation of
[12:19.840 --> 12:29.360]  a sizable ransom payment okay if you go back just 30 40 years ago small ships
[12:29.360 --> 12:35.480]  large ships container ships you name it they had semi-automatic weapons they
[12:35.480 --> 12:41.920]  had grenade launchers they are tough guys on the ships and companies you know
[12:41.920 --> 12:46.680]  had their crew armed because they'd come out of the piracy of the last several
[12:46.680 --> 12:52.360]  thousand years and they knew that the answer is to have a watchman on deck on
[12:52.360 --> 12:57.520]  fire watch watching for pirates or for fires or for anything else or for you
[12:57.520 --> 13:02.720]  know ships or debris you got watchmen out there including those who are at the
[13:02.720 --> 13:08.320]  con who were in control the ship the captain of their designates and then
[13:08.320 --> 13:11.800]  if somebody comes up alongside the ship without permission and start trying to
[13:11.800 --> 13:16.120]  go on board you kill them now all these nations though the globalist of the
[13:16.120 --> 13:20.240]  control they want the seas to be lawless so they can bring in the law the sea
[13:20.240 --> 13:23.320]  tree they've been trying to pass for 40 years that makes the united nations
[13:23.320 --> 13:27.480]  create its own navy and tax every ship on earth and control all the nation's
[13:27.480 --> 13:31.360]  ports and their inland waterways this is on record if they're trying to ratify
[13:31.360 --> 13:35.920]  right now and trying for decades in the u.s a lot of other countries have
[13:35.920 --> 13:42.640]  ratified it and it's a 74% of the earth's surface is seawater another
[13:42.640 --> 13:47.520]  one-and-a-half percent is freshwater and they want total control I mean they
[13:47.520 --> 13:52.480]  already control the Great Lakes under you and treaties and that's public you
[13:52.480 --> 13:55.320]  can just Google that and read mainstream news articles about it people raise a
[13:55.320 --> 14:00.640]  big stink over it so they don't allow people to be armed and so of course the
[14:00.640 --> 14:04.880]  Chinese government's been caught out pirating people ships and blaming it on
[14:04.880 --> 14:09.440]  other pirates they've caught indonesian government doing it they've caught
[14:09.440 --> 14:12.240]  Latin American countries doing it because you mean you don't just think
[14:12.240 --> 14:16.560]  these pirates just come back to port and are just left alone without paying a big
[14:16.560 --> 14:22.960]  fat cuts local corrupt people and so in a lot of nations after decades of piracy
[14:22.960 --> 14:28.160]  the local constabulary says you know what we'll just go ahead and fully take
[14:28.160 --> 14:33.400]  this over and so the Japanese have gone public you know they've videoed and you
[14:33.400 --> 14:37.160]  know from other ships and now they've been having confrontations with the
[14:37.160 --> 14:44.000]  Chinese and Chinese ships have been ramming us naval vessels the people in
[14:44.000 --> 14:48.640]  Chinese uniform on Chinese government craft their coast guard mainly out
[14:48.640 --> 14:56.840]  there stealing stuff all over the place just north of Korea and you know in the
[14:56.840 --> 15:01.800]  sea between Japan and China proper so it's just constant robbing constant
[15:01.800 --> 15:08.040]  stealing constant thieving going on and their answer is don't and of course I've
[15:08.040 --> 15:11.280]  had captains and other experts on who've been attacked successfully defended
[15:11.280 --> 15:16.880]  because they were armed the answer is instead of having billions of dollars
[15:16.880 --> 15:23.240]  and ransom that's now what it is every year the answer is legislatively say
[15:23.240 --> 15:29.480]  that the ships are to be armed and they could pay to have three or four people
[15:29.480 --> 15:34.240]  on each ship who are specifically armed if the sailors want to sign on and go
[15:34.240 --> 15:36.920]  through a training course they can be armed as well have the whole crew armed
[15:36.920 --> 15:41.840]  these are professionals they navigate gigantic ships through channels carrying
[15:41.840 --> 15:55.800]  you know poisonous gases explosive gases ammonium sulfur cyanide gas sulfur just
[15:55.800 --> 16:01.200]  all this explosive stuff fertilizer the list goes on and on in all your major
[16:01.200 --> 16:07.320]  cities you got these ships big and small coming in much more dangerous per capita
[16:07.320 --> 16:10.040]  than the jet airliners with those professionals up there flying who they
[16:10.040 --> 16:19.520]  will fight to the nail a lot of to not allow them to be armed so you are the
[16:19.520 --> 16:22.960]  professionals you are in the pilots you are in the captains you are in the
[16:22.960 --> 16:27.680]  companies can all decide how they want to do it and then you arm them and let me
[16:27.680 --> 16:33.040]  tell you these Somalis will back off real fast the Chinese will back off real
[16:33.040 --> 16:37.280]  fast if when they pull up to attack a boat people open up on him you know you
[16:37.280 --> 16:40.720]  loudspeaker and get away from our boat
[16:45.280 --> 16:49.760]  just amazing in fact they already that there are a lot of nations like the
[16:49.760 --> 16:54.760]  Israelis who do allow everybody to be armed on the ship so you never see them
[16:54.760 --> 16:59.520]  being jacked you never see them being pirated because they see Israeli ships
[16:59.520 --> 17:09.680]  Israeli flags they run in fear they run in fear but all they know the country's
[17:09.680 --> 17:14.040]  like the United States and Saudi Arabia and others who don't allow the people
[17:14.040 --> 17:20.880]  on board their ships to be armed and they just love it they look we're a big
[17:20.880 --> 17:25.560]  fat target when you're disarmed you're a big fat target it is very simple why
[17:25.560 --> 17:29.760]  people love to attack and mug women you know not just rape them they look a
[17:29.760 --> 17:32.360]  mugger's choice is a woman with a purse why because on average a woman in the
[17:32.360 --> 17:37.440]  snatch a handgun out of that person blow you away like a man is I mean you see
[17:37.440 --> 17:42.360]  people mugging people with fanny packs no because they know that person's got a
[17:42.360 --> 17:47.600]  firearm is going to kill me dead in a hammer that's why in Florida and Texas
[17:47.600 --> 17:51.680]  and every other state 30 plus states within two years you can pull up the
[17:51.680 --> 17:55.920]  federal numbers on this within two years of having a concealed carry violent
[17:55.920 --> 18:04.200]  crime rates drop on average by 24% carjackings end for all intents and
[18:04.200 --> 18:09.600]  purposes I mean around here in Texas the thieves are scared to death folks

[24:43.840 --> 24:50.320]  fault those three cops got killed I mean it is asinine it is ridiculous even if
[24:50.320 --> 24:53.920]  that guy was a big fan of the show and agreed with me which by the way he wrote
[24:53.920 --> 24:56.960]  all these posts attacking me and didn't agree with me and the media knew that
[24:56.960 --> 25:00.920]  lied the Pittsburgh Post-Cosette has done two articles retracting saying he
[25:00.920 --> 25:06.080]  actually didn't like me and was critical of me but they don't care the New York
[25:06.080 --> 25:12.800]  Times doesn't care all these publications don't care because they're
[25:12.800 --> 25:17.240]  attacking the first amendment more than they're even attacking the second
[25:17.240 --> 25:24.360]  amendment and they're coming after all your rights because I sit here and I
[25:24.360 --> 25:28.320]  cover the scary things the criminal things the corrupt out of control

[25:37.680 --> 25:44.920]  into orbit and the liberals of the the establishment liberals really hate me
[25:44.920 --> 25:52.560]  because I'm calling them on their bluff I'm calling them on their bluff you know
[25:52.560 --> 25:56.280]  we were there exposing Clinton when he was a popular the globalist carrying out
[25:56.280 --> 26:00.480]  corruption we were called right-wing fascist Nazi racist with no evidence
[26:00.480 --> 26:07.200]  just made up then I was called a hardcore communist funded by George Soros
[26:07.200 --> 26:14.720]  when I was attacking George Bush totally made up absolute bull now I am going
[26:14.720 --> 26:18.320]  after Obama as a puppet saying can we just get past the puppet please to the
[26:18.320 --> 26:28.800]  bankers that have stolen 12.8 trillion and the establishment is saying no Alex
[26:28.800 --> 26:36.240]  you're a evil right-wing racist fascist cop killer and world government
[26:36.240 --> 26:43.920]  doesn't exist and Obama isn't calling for more gun control and you're a liar it's
[26:43.920 --> 26:48.680]  just ridiculous because as long as they can keep us arguing about left and
[26:48.680 --> 26:53.920]  right all day long look he criticized the government whoever's in power if it's
[26:53.920 --> 26:57.360]  a Republican they're gonna call you a commie if it's a Democrat they're gonna
[26:57.360 --> 27:03.600]  call you a fascist when it's the same policies and you Democrats are pathetic
[27:03.600 --> 27:09.200]  not all of you a lot of big ones including Bob Dylan and a bunch of other
[27:09.200 --> 27:13.360]  bunch of top liberal writers who do have a soul are coming out and saying my god
[27:13.360 --> 27:16.560]  Obama's bad you know he writes for the Huffington Post Max Kaiser said he'd
[27:16.560 --> 27:20.080]  hoped Obama'd be better I mean it should be easy to be better than Bush and he
[27:20.080 --> 27:25.160]  says he's worse he said here two days ago that's a guy with a BBC TV show that's
[27:25.160 --> 27:28.920]  a guy with a syndicated radio show that's a guy who writes for one of the
[27:28.920 --> 27:33.200]  biggest columns out there and he's risking all he's got to tell the truth
[27:33.200 --> 27:38.640]  because we tell he's committing heresy but I mean how can you not go the king
[27:38.640 --> 27:41.720]  has no clothes the emperor has no clothes he's butt naked I mean he's
[27:41.720 --> 27:45.520]  expanding the secrecy expanding the worthless wiretapping taking over the
[27:45.520 --> 27:50.120]  whole internet publicly the the technologies are he appointed resigns and
[27:50.120 --> 27:56.160]  says I can't be part of this it almost gets no attention he's got nothing but
[27:56.160 --> 28:01.400]  criminal bankers running everything and then the left I mean I'm being directly
[28:01.400 --> 28:07.120]  attacked by George Soros right now you know that's who runs media matters
[28:07.680 --> 28:15.080]  literally runs it and all these other big sites that he publicly funds are
[28:15.080 --> 28:18.920]  attacking me let me tell you something folks it's creepy to have the eye of
[28:18.920 --> 28:24.840]  Soron on you I mean you think it's fun having hardcore people like George
[28:24.840 --> 28:32.000]  Soros after you and having the distinct pleasure of having fake conservatives
[28:32.000 --> 28:35.720]  controlled by that brand of Kool-Aid you got the cherry Kool-Aid that's the
[28:35.720 --> 28:40.400]  Republican stuff with cyanide you got the grape that's the Democrat flavor or
[28:40.400 --> 28:44.840]  orange or whatever you want to call it and I'm not drinking either one of them
[28:44.840 --> 28:48.040]  you got me Jack and you want to call me crazy because I'm not going to drink
[28:48.040 --> 28:57.160]  either one of your Kool-Aids and I have tried and tried and tried to not be the
[28:57.160 --> 29:02.880]  leader I have tried to not be the poster boy for a lot of reasons number one it
[29:02.880 --> 29:07.920]  makes us weaker to have it focused on a leader it needs to be an idea a manifesto
[29:07.920 --> 29:10.840]  a bill of rights a Constitution Declaration of Independence something
[29:10.840 --> 29:16.920]  that's in stone that all people can be leaders in because then they can't be
[29:16.920 --> 29:20.200]  then if they try to target the idea themselves they look stupid and you're
[29:20.200 --> 29:23.040]  attacking free speech you're attacking self-defense but see they can make it
[29:23.040 --> 29:28.680]  all about me they can be somewhat successful now in the process it makes
[29:28.680 --> 29:34.880]  me huge and I've always known that's the path see I've been holding back being
[29:34.880 --> 29:39.760]  explosively huge and I realize now I'm not gonna be able to do that and now I
[29:39.760 --> 29:44.280]  have to face my fear because that's the final fear I now enter the phase of
[29:44.280 --> 29:48.920]  maximum danger a lot of you wanting to see them crush me you're probably gonna
[29:48.920 --> 29:56.080]  get to see it now we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the
[29:56.080 --> 30:04.880]  GCN radio network with our economy spiraling out of control living in the
[30:04.880 --> 30:09.000]  soup kitchens may be right around the corner no one saw the financial collapse
[30:09.000 --> 30:14.160]  of 1929 many didn't make it and millions ended up in soup lines becoming
[30:14.160 --> 30:20.760]  vagrants begging for food unlike 1929 we can see this collapse coming we have
[30:20.760 --> 30:25.120]  been warned and right now we have a very small window of opportunity to get food
[30:25.120 --> 30:29.800]  storage into our homes before it's too late too late why is the Canadian
[30:29.800 --> 30:33.400]  government telling their citizens to stock up why and why are soldiers

[35:39.600 --> 35:44.640]  mainstream TV controlled news sites can't say I'm making it up so they have to
[35:44.640 --> 35:52.760]  make sure the cattle as they call them haven't heard any of this so they can
[35:52.760 --> 35:56.720]  say I'm a liar and then people believe it I got another report here San Marcos
[35:56.720 --> 36:00.600]  Texas where they're on the news saying you've got to take your vaccines or
[36:00.600 --> 36:03.760]  you'll be arrested it's the law when there is no law to take the vaccines I
[36:03.760 --> 36:10.720]  mean there's just no end to the criminal line that goes on and it's the scope of
[36:10.720 --> 36:14.320]  the lies is the reason they get away with so much of it but let me address
[36:14.320 --> 36:22.640]  this now then we'll open the phones up about that and a host of issues and
[36:22.640 --> 36:26.440]  there's so many different angles to all of this but let me just go through them
[36:26.440 --> 36:33.400]  number one every time there is a mass shooting or a bombing the government
[36:33.400 --> 36:38.400]  tries to link it to its political opposition and how can you tell who the
[36:38.400 --> 36:42.080]  real opposition to the new world order is that is global private banks setting
[36:42.080 --> 36:45.760]  up world government through a regulatory system setting tax rates on a
[36:45.760 --> 36:52.280]  planetary scale interest rates and currency rates what's been openly
[36:52.280 --> 36:55.080]  announced there's no more denying world government it's literally in thousands
[36:55.080 --> 36:59.960]  of news articles world leaders openly announcing a global government how do
[36:59.960 --> 37:04.280]  you know what their real opposition is it's the patriots it's the libertarians
[37:04.280 --> 37:07.920]  it's the freedom lovers it's people that want smaller government and don't want
[37:07.920 --> 37:12.280]  to be under an empire it's anti-globalist on the left if you want to use the false
[37:12.280 --> 37:18.120]  paradigm and so what do you see the government always attacking always
[37:18.120 --> 37:21.240]  criticizing you know last year when they had the violent radicalization act
[37:21.240 --> 37:25.200]  hearings in congress they showed 9-11 truth right next to al-qaeda and said
[37:25.200 --> 37:28.960]  this is a terrorist group we got a shot down their free speech because they know
[37:28.960 --> 37:32.600]  the public finds out that elements of the government are staging terror attacks
[37:32.600 --> 37:36.360]  and find out it's in government manuals and he classified documents and it's
[37:36.360 --> 37:39.920]  been done hundreds of times the jig is up they could be brought to justice this
[37:39.920 --> 37:46.440]  is dangerous for the establishment and the left gatekeep attacked us and tried
[37:46.440 --> 37:51.000]  to shut us down and protected bushes flank all through his eight years of his
[37:51.000 --> 37:57.960]  administration but now that we're going after barack obama as a frontman and as
[37:57.960 --> 38:02.320]  a puppet and make no mistake he's gonna stage big terror attacks we've analyzed
[38:02.320 --> 38:05.520]  their whole program they're not gonna be able to get their operation through
[38:05.520 --> 38:11.320]  without having some stage terror to get the American people all scared and to
[38:11.320 --> 38:14.920]  get the American people to all rally around government well they may be
[38:14.920 --> 38:17.960]  robin is blind but at least they're keeping me safe from whoever nuked
[38:17.960 --> 38:24.120]  chicago or whoever dirty bomb Dallas or whoever went into that shopping mall in
[38:24.120 --> 38:27.880]  austin texas and got everybody down i'm telling you i'm telling you they're
[38:27.880 --> 38:33.080]  going to do it just like i told you 9-11 i said they'll probably attack the
[38:33.080 --> 38:38.160]  world trade center and blame it on their cias so do some have been lied because
[38:38.160 --> 38:41.280]  we knew the feds had cooked the bomb train the drivers and ran the whole
[38:41.280 --> 38:46.800]  operation according to the new york times even in nineteen ninety three at
[38:46.800 --> 38:51.120]  the world trade center they literally went and pulled off waco as a
[38:51.120 --> 38:57.400]  distraction the memos came out on that and then to as a distraction over waco
[38:57.400 --> 39:03.200]  they carried out oklahoma city so let's just talk turkey here
[39:03.200 --> 39:10.880]  let's just talk reality here for people like max bloom and fall at alternate
[39:10.880 --> 39:16.600]  with their hundreds of thousands of readers basically coming out and saying i
[39:16.600 --> 39:24.200]  had the cops killed pretty amazing stuff let me tell you something punk this is
[39:24.200 --> 39:33.320]  the real world this isn't your candy ass planet of fake liberal sophistry and
[39:33.320 --> 39:38.480]  propaganda do you understand me i'm risking my life and my name my treasure
[39:38.480 --> 39:43.760]  and my blood sweat and tears for you i'm right about the new world order i know
[39:43.760 --> 39:47.000]  they're eugenicist i know they funded hitler and stalling and now it's on
[39:47.000 --> 39:51.680]  record david rocker feller wrote op ed pieces of the new york times bragging
[39:51.680 --> 39:58.160]  about it funding now who killed sixty plus million people this isn't a joke and
[39:58.160 --> 40:02.120]  don't be like the the fools who supported linen early on who ended up in
[40:02.120 --> 40:05.560]  deep trouble you understand people like you are going to be the first targets of
[40:05.560 --> 40:19.000]  this thing once it takes over this is life and death son and i'm not going to
[40:19.000 --> 40:25.960]  be sucked in to the new york times or raw story or daily costs or the pitts
[40:25.960 --> 40:32.200]  bird post gazette or george soros's media matters i'm not going to be sucked
[40:32.200 --> 40:36.480]  into any of your left right paradigm when you call me a hardcore super right
[40:36.480 --> 40:42.520]  wing fascist racist i am not going to be sucked into that libel that slander
[40:42.520 --> 40:48.600]  that defamation everybody who knows who i am knows that's a crock and knows
[40:48.600 --> 40:57.000]  you're instantly discredited but you're discredited at your base because you for
[40:57.000 --> 41:02.480]  decades have told everybody there's no new world order and you went further you
[41:02.480 --> 41:07.000]  said these crazy say it's going to be run by a private group of banks and we're
[41:07.000 --> 41:12.720]  going to have a global currency tax a wire transfer tax toben tax that was
[41:12.720 --> 41:15.880]  openly proposed is why we're right we just read what they said they were going
[41:15.880 --> 41:22.040]  to do introduced in the u n a tax on all carbon to control everybody and that
[41:22.040 --> 41:26.560]  they would implode the economy through derivatives to bring this in i've been
[41:26.560 --> 41:30.960]  saying that for ten plus years because i was reading what george soros was
[41:30.960 --> 41:33.920]  saying they were going to do i was reading what david Rockefeller said
[41:33.920 --> 41:37.520]  they were going to i was reading imf and world bank documents i was
[41:37.520 --> 41:40.840]  interviewing other economist and people that were aware of it like george
[41:40.840 --> 41:48.240]  Humphrey who wrote a book common sense they wrote uncommon sense
[41:48.240 --> 41:52.880]  laying out ten years ago ex we sell the audio books and the pamphlets to this
[41:52.880 --> 41:59.480]  day at info wars dot com laying out exactly what has now happened
[41:59.480 --> 42:04.400]  he actually wrote common sense in ninety seven or is it ninety eight and you
[42:04.400 --> 42:07.360]  wrote uncommon sense i think in ninety nine but the point is that's more than
[42:07.360 --> 42:10.840]  ten years ago for the first one the point is we're on record and people
[42:10.840 --> 42:14.600]  listened and they remember and they see our books and videos on record and they
[42:14.600 --> 42:18.360]  know we told the truth and they know we were accurate and they know we pegged
[42:18.360 --> 42:23.440]  it exactly precisely see the public would go to the library in the nineties
[42:23.440 --> 42:26.360]  is most of us what on the web then and they would just hear me on the radio
[42:26.360 --> 42:30.080]  and say all that guy's a liar when i read a biological diversity assessment by
[42:30.080 --> 42:34.160]  the u n nineteen ninety six saying they want world government to carry out the
[42:34.160 --> 42:38.120]  orderly calling of eighty percent of us now they can go directly to mainstream
[42:38.120 --> 42:43.680]  websites and read the scans or go to the u n zone site and read it
[42:43.680 --> 42:47.160]  so they heard us say all this wild stuff and i agree it's crazy
[42:47.160 --> 42:50.880]  who could believe this but it's real truth is stranger than fiction and so all
[42:50.880 --> 42:54.320]  these years you said it didn't exist all these years you said it wasn't
[42:54.320 --> 42:57.560]  happening all i mean i remember limbaugh saying both the left and right on
[42:57.560 --> 43:01.840]  by the same people saying none of this existed none of this was happening
[43:01.840 --> 43:07.000]  none of this was going on none of this was real
[43:07.000 --> 43:09.840]  and you said it over and over again all of you
[43:09.840 --> 43:14.440]  it was so much fun to to say all there's no global elite there's no corrupt
[43:14.440 --> 43:19.120]  group of corporations trying to do hostile takeovers of nations all
[43:19.120 --> 43:26.320]  those are just crazy people and all how tell me about the martians next
[43:26.320 --> 43:30.400]  and the media to do always in tv shows and things to sandwich in ufo's and
[43:30.400 --> 43:34.320]  cuba cobras in with the serious issues thinking that would work no that didn't
[43:34.320 --> 43:37.320]  work that discredited you even faster
[43:37.320 --> 43:40.400]  and people differentiated the fun fantasy stuff
[43:40.400 --> 43:43.480]  with the reality
[43:43.480 --> 43:47.440]  comprende
[43:47.440 --> 43:50.160]  and so people found out the truth
[43:50.160 --> 43:53.560]  and you guys are really thought you can handle it all to deal with all of all
[43:53.560 --> 43:56.160]  your spin doctors
[43:56.160 --> 43:59.000]  and so now you're this is them grabbing at straws
[43:59.000 --> 44:02.440]  all summer white supremacist uh... out of work
[44:02.440 --> 44:03.520]  uh... guy
[44:03.520 --> 44:04.440]  whose dogs are
[44:04.440 --> 44:08.240]  urinating all over mommy's rug she tells him get out so he throws a fit the
[44:08.240 --> 44:11.320]  cop show up in minutes he guns them down
[44:11.320 --> 44:14.040]  the police uh... feed
[44:14.040 --> 44:16.560]  and the fb i feeds their operatives
[44:16.560 --> 44:20.200]  at the southern property law center in a d l all the guys handles
[44:20.200 --> 44:21.480]  they feed them
[44:21.480 --> 44:23.360]  all the sites where he's commented
[44:23.360 --> 44:26.800]  and they come out and say all he was a fan of alex jones and we're talking to
[44:26.800 --> 44:29.900]  reporter and i said oh
[44:29.900 --> 44:32.480]  he said you have been reading his comments on a really i said uh... what's
[44:32.480 --> 44:36.280]  his handle all i don't really want to get into that you know
[44:36.280 --> 44:37.840]  but the point is
[44:37.840 --> 44:40.880]  is that he said all he didn't really agree with you but i know he didn't put
[44:40.880 --> 44:43.920]  that the article i said how do you know that all i just read some of his post
[44:43.920 --> 44:46.400]  and then we finally learn he's posting on my site
[44:46.400 --> 44:50.320]  and the guys attacking me and attacking me on other sites
[44:50.320 --> 44:52.040]  and they knew that all along
[44:52.040 --> 44:55.280]  and the fb i fed that to the a d l
[44:55.280 --> 44:59.720]  and which they admit they work whether they have a deal as an office at youtube
[44:59.720 --> 45:02.000]  has an office at the fb i has an office
[45:02.000 --> 45:03.640]  at the b a t f
[45:03.640 --> 45:05.920]  they fed that on the media
[45:05.920 --> 45:10.080]  about me and now folks have found out about it they found out
[45:10.080 --> 45:12.120]  about how that was planted
[45:12.120 --> 45:14.840]  in the media to go after who's the big threat it's me
[45:14.840 --> 45:18.560]  because i'm telling the truth
[45:18.560 --> 45:23.240]  and we have radically shifted the paradigms so much the headline should
[45:23.240 --> 45:26.360]  have been white supremacist in like alex jones
[45:26.360 --> 45:29.740]  see it wasn't
[45:29.740 --> 45:32.600]  they are so desperate because all of this is coming out we have shifted the
[45:32.600 --> 45:35.000]  paradigm all these years
[45:35.000 --> 45:36.600]  i mean i've made films
[45:36.600 --> 45:38.200]  that have conservatively
[45:38.200 --> 45:42.120]  been watched on the internet in game
[45:42.120 --> 45:46.240]  in game has been conservatively watched on the internet more than fifty million
[45:46.240 --> 45:50.320]  times that we can go around different sites and count up
[45:50.320 --> 45:53.660]  the obama deception hundreds of versions of it on the web
[45:53.660 --> 45:57.040]  i've spent hours going over how many times been watched within two weeks have
[45:57.040 --> 46:01.840]  been watched more than fifteen million times
[46:01.840 --> 46:04.120]  you think the establishment likes the fact
[46:04.120 --> 46:08.760]  i can make a film that cost a hundred thousand dollars and i release it free
[46:08.760 --> 46:11.960]  and in two weeks it's been seen more than fifteen million times it's now three
[46:11.960 --> 46:14.200]  plus weeks i haven't gone and counted up yet
[46:14.200 --> 46:18.160]  takes hours around hundreds of sites and counted up
[46:18.160 --> 46:19.840]  you think they like that
[46:19.840 --> 46:23.680]  you think george soros who spent his own hard-earned money to put barack obama
[46:23.680 --> 46:26.320]  in to pacify the left
[46:26.320 --> 46:29.840]  that's all that is a copy of the left you think he likes that
[46:29.840 --> 46:34.640]  you understand the zone i've stepped into the level we've gone to
[46:34.640 --> 46:38.560]  and see i always wanted to have hundreds and hundreds of big leaders
[46:38.560 --> 46:42.400]  because number one listening carefully that is the hardest thing to defeat
[46:42.400 --> 46:44.320]  because if it's about an idea
[46:44.320 --> 46:45.760]  that's bulletproof
[46:45.760 --> 46:50.560]  an idea is invincible an idea can't be stopped they can't say all the first
[46:50.560 --> 46:51.400]  amendment
[46:51.400 --> 46:53.720]  killed
[46:53.720 --> 46:56.960]  those three cops or the second amendment and then people defend that right
[46:56.960 --> 47:01.600]  doesn't work when they say all the crazy guy alex jones he did it
[47:01.600 --> 47:03.400]  that they can make it all about me and then
[47:03.400 --> 47:07.360]  manufactured things about me or find real flaws i have and blow them up to
[47:07.360 --> 47:10.600]  organchial and proportions
[47:10.600 --> 47:16.560]  then they can plant drugs on me or they can set me up or they can kill me
[47:16.560 --> 47:19.880]  and then all look they've discredited an idea in a movement now we've done a
[47:19.880 --> 47:22.960]  good job of having a lot of other leaders a lot of other people and the idea
[47:22.960 --> 47:24.160]  out there
[47:24.160 --> 47:26.640]  but it's still not as good as it should be
[47:26.640 --> 47:27.840]  and i will tell you
[47:27.840 --> 47:31.280]  that it's normally a prelude to them setting you up or killing you
[47:31.280 --> 47:34.200]  for them to go ahead and demonize you in the media so when they do kill you or
[47:34.200 --> 47:35.080]  set you up
[47:35.080 --> 47:38.200]  they say all this is the guy that was connected to the cop killer and then
[47:38.200 --> 47:43.700]  that can kind of be your obituary
[47:43.700 --> 47:46.760]  but more often than not i should be thankful they're just trying to demonize
[47:46.760 --> 47:47.760]  me because that
[47:47.760 --> 47:49.000]  eighty percent of the time
[47:49.000 --> 47:55.680]  or more that just means there they're going the route of trying to discredit me
[47:55.680 --> 47:58.280]  you understand
[47:58.280 --> 48:01.080]  but from a selfish view
[48:01.080 --> 48:03.760]  and i wouldn't have just done this from a selfish view if it wasn't the right
[48:03.760 --> 48:05.160]  thing to do anyways
[48:05.160 --> 48:09.480]  but from a selfish view studying history studying leaders studying this type of
[48:09.480 --> 48:10.360]  information
[48:10.360 --> 48:13.440]  i've always said no i'm not your leader no i'm not the leader no i'm not going to
[48:13.440 --> 48:16.440]  lead the movement you go out and lead it you go out and set it up
[48:16.440 --> 48:17.880]  because
[48:17.880 --> 48:23.160]  that is when you really get a cap busted in your butt
[48:23.160 --> 48:26.160]  that is when you get blasted that is when you get killed
[48:26.160 --> 48:29.320]  that's when they pull you over shoot you up with something so you have a heart
[48:29.320 --> 48:30.040]  attack
[48:30.040 --> 48:31.200]  that's when they
[48:31.200 --> 48:34.200]  park a truck across the street hitting you with radiation guns which they
[48:34.200 --> 48:35.440]  admit they do
[48:35.440 --> 48:38.960]  and you know you get cancer a week later dive a week you know a uh... one week
[48:38.960 --> 48:40.800]  tumor
[48:40.800 --> 48:42.960]  you really been microwave basically
[48:42.960 --> 48:45.160]  as they admit now they use in feluja
[48:45.160 --> 48:49.080]  so i mean i've entered the most dangerous phase in my life
[48:49.080 --> 48:53.040]  and now that because it's better for them to make it about leaders
[48:53.040 --> 48:55.160]  they've made it about three people
[48:55.160 --> 48:57.960]  rush limbaugh
[48:57.960 --> 48:59.240]  rush limbaugh
[48:59.240 --> 49:02.160]  glenn beckon alex jones
[49:02.160 --> 49:05.800]  they have made it about rush limbaugh as he has a huge pumpkin head he's a total
[49:05.800 --> 49:08.720]  drug addict discredited he makes it about a right-wing paradigm he's
[49:08.720 --> 49:12.520]  perfect for him white house memos is anyone making about limbaugh
[49:12.520 --> 49:15.600]  glenn beck on purpose is meant to act goofy when he brings up conspiracy
[49:15.600 --> 49:16.280]  theories
[49:16.280 --> 49:19.080]  then he discredits his own theories with strongman
[49:19.080 --> 49:21.600]  he's an operative
[49:21.600 --> 49:25.920]  but with me it's because they're trying to tie me in with the hatred of those
[49:25.920 --> 49:26.820]  two
[49:26.820 --> 49:31.200]  to try to create a meme or kind of a signpost a logo
[49:31.200 --> 49:34.660]  or a you know a term a a stereotype
[49:34.660 --> 49:36.080]  alex jones
[49:36.080 --> 49:39.760]  so that when people hear the information they wonder why they're losing their
[49:39.760 --> 49:43.440]  house and why there's hyperinflation and why there's riots on the streets they
[49:43.440 --> 49:45.960]  can just say alex jones
[49:45.960 --> 49:50.920]  like a term conspiracy theory to try to discredit
[49:50.920 --> 49:54.720]  and so what this means is and it's been happening a lot in the past anyways
[49:54.720 --> 49:56.520]  we have arrived
[49:56.520 --> 49:57.900]  you know that's why
[49:57.900 --> 49:59.840]  uh... the mainstream media
[49:59.840 --> 50:02.560]  is constantly attacking me for years that's why
[50:02.560 --> 50:06.020]  uh... the neocons attack me for years but see the neocons
[50:06.020 --> 50:08.320]  they can now act like they're out of power
[50:08.320 --> 50:11.560]  and they need to build up their basic and in the name of fighting obama so
[50:11.560 --> 50:14.160]  they're trying to co-op what we do that's why they
[50:14.160 --> 50:17.140]  a little sprinkle here a little sprinkle there you know they
[50:17.140 --> 50:20.680]  it's like i'm a cayenne pepper they put one cayenne pepper in the soup

[1:08:40.480 --> 1:08:44.320]  three weeks ago because i know what is fake
[1:08:44.320 --> 1:08:49.440]  i know what was fake i knew that linda thompson's video of the amtrak
[1:08:49.440 --> 1:08:55.600]  uh repair facility in illinois was fake i've known that forever it's been
[1:08:55.600 --> 1:08:58.880]  out since 95 i mean i've had that tape mailed to me probably
[1:08:58.880 --> 1:09:02.720]  150 times no exaggeration back when it was on vhs
[1:09:02.720 --> 1:09:06.480]  emailed to me thousands of times and i know that they have training facilities
[1:09:06.480 --> 1:09:08.640]  and i haven't even seen this yet bermas was just telling i didn't see the
[1:09:08.640 --> 1:09:11.440]  debunking part two last night bermas is coming in that's why he's coming in to
[1:09:11.440 --> 1:09:14.000]  tell us about him by the clips he said you were right again
[1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:17.680]  they showed the louisiana mississippi nato training base
[1:09:17.680 --> 1:09:22.080]  and said it was a military training base and then somebody online probably one
[1:09:22.080 --> 1:09:25.920]  of their associates miss marked a north korean
[1:09:25.920 --> 1:09:32.400]  fema camp death camp control camp uh and said us base
[1:09:32.400 --> 1:09:37.120]  see straw man that's what i didn't peg the north korean thing is i hadn't seen
[1:09:37.120 --> 1:09:40.400]  that hoax and so that's what they're gonna do
[1:09:40.400 --> 1:09:43.520]  hundreds of real camps government documents congressional testimony
[1:09:43.520 --> 1:09:52.720]  oh they didn't play that they went directly to the fake debunking
[1:09:52.800 --> 1:09:55.920]  and what we're doing is we're educating the public and showing them the tricks
[1:09:55.920 --> 1:09:58.960]  they play here but i mean i'm not that smart you learn their tricks you know
[1:09:58.960 --> 1:10:01.440]  their tricks you know what play they're gonna call
[1:10:01.440 --> 1:10:04.320]  it's like you may have a football team you love and you've been watching them
[1:10:04.320 --> 1:10:08.240]  for decades or watching a coach from team to team and 98% of the time you
[1:10:08.240 --> 1:10:11.920]  know what he's gonna call because you watch football
[1:10:11.920 --> 1:10:14.960]  well it's the same thing here we watch the enemy and we know all their tricks
[1:10:14.960 --> 1:10:19.600]  and they're so predictable it's disgusting
[1:10:19.600 --> 1:10:23.120]  it's like we aren't blind but the general public is it's like we've had the
[1:10:23.120 --> 1:10:26.560]  blinders taken off and the public hasn't i'm just like take the blinders off
[1:10:26.560 --> 1:10:29.920]  please and the media goes no don't listen to conspiracies
[1:10:29.920 --> 1:10:34.080]  don't take your blinders off don't look don't look listen to the liberals and
[1:10:34.080 --> 1:10:36.880]  listen to the conservatives and listen to what they have to say and be
[1:10:36.880 --> 1:10:40.160]  sucked into the paradigm and get into the sports team rah rah
[1:10:40.160 --> 1:10:43.360]  i'm for the republican i'm for the democrat you know
[1:10:43.360 --> 1:10:47.360]  i'm for mccain i'm for obama and they give you these two choices and you get
[1:10:47.360 --> 1:10:51.200]  all fired up and get invested and get committed and tie up your
[1:10:51.200 --> 1:10:56.640]  psyche with one of the candidates and then you're committed to that false
[1:10:56.640 --> 1:11:00.320]  paradigm and the globalists go on while you're busy watching this false
[1:11:00.320 --> 1:11:04.000]  projection they put out the matrix they're
[1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:07.680]  taking over our freedoms and our liberties
[1:11:08.320 --> 1:11:11.360]  and so the establishment in closing when i'm going to your calls
[1:11:11.360 --> 1:11:16.800]  is getting desperate because they've lost their initiative they're having to go
[1:11:16.800 --> 1:11:20.000]  through gun control now and victim disarmament covertly
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:22.640]  they're having to harass gun shops they're having to shut them down with
[1:11:22.640 --> 1:11:25.840]  harassment they're having to use what the executive powers you know to shut
[1:11:25.840 --> 1:11:30.240]  down importation outside congress uh... they're having to
[1:11:30.240 --> 1:11:32.960]  you know just expand their powers unconstitutionally
[1:11:32.960 --> 1:11:37.680]  they tripled the size of the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives
[1:11:37.680 --> 1:11:40.640]  they got an attorney general is verently anti-gun
[1:11:40.640 --> 1:11:44.560]  they've introduced all these bills but they won't discuss the bills they can't
[1:11:44.560 --> 1:11:47.440]  come out and bash people for not passing them
[1:11:47.440 --> 1:11:49.760]  even though most of the bills is stuff that the white house chief of staff
[1:11:49.760 --> 1:11:54.000]  introduced when he was a leading congressman from illinois
[1:11:54.000 --> 1:11:56.560]  we've gone over those bills and read the bill numbers and you know
[1:11:56.560 --> 1:12:00.400]  we've read on air attorney general holders filing the supreme court saying
[1:12:00.400 --> 1:12:03.920]  ban all guns i mean don't you understand how you get
[1:12:03.920 --> 1:12:07.760]  discredited george soros foundation fake liberals
[1:12:07.760 --> 1:12:11.520]  you know they're there to co-op the left limbaugh is there to co-op the right
[1:12:11.520 --> 1:12:15.200]  same thing with the handy and blend back in the rest of
[1:12:15.200 --> 1:12:18.240]  and see the left has woken up to this new world are being real
[1:12:18.240 --> 1:12:21.600]  so they're they're waking up and joining the people and so the establishments
[1:12:21.600 --> 1:12:24.720]  trying to keep their people on the reservation
[1:12:24.720 --> 1:12:28.240]  on the plantation same thing with limbaugh and their guys are having to
[1:12:28.240 --> 1:12:30.960]  cover a little bit of it now but saying okay there's a world government
[1:12:30.960 --> 1:12:34.960]  but it's it's obama trying well yeah he's carrying the ball right now
[1:12:34.960 --> 1:12:38.240]  he's the quarterback in the game right now they've pulled mccain out
[1:12:38.240 --> 1:12:42.720]  now they pulled bush out they've got the celebrity quarterback in there
[1:12:42.720 --> 1:12:49.680]  but he works for the same franchise owner use krs ones analogy
[1:12:49.680 --> 1:12:52.400]  so that's the type of stuff that's going on
[1:12:52.400 --> 1:12:55.360]  and they're getting upset folks i'm getting contacted constantly by huge
[1:12:55.360 --> 1:12:57.840]  rap icons most of them are scared to come on the show

[1:13:28.560 --> 1:13:32.000]  12.8 trillion to offshore bankers that engineered the collapse
[1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:35.200]  and we're going to have socialism might as well just pay off the mortgages
[1:13:35.200 --> 1:13:39.440]  bloomberg financial reported three months ago when it was at nine trillion
[1:13:39.440 --> 1:13:42.320]  or two months ago it was at nine trillion but that would have paid off 90
[1:13:42.320 --> 1:13:45.280]  plus percent of the mortgages it's now at 12.8 trillion
[1:13:45.280 --> 1:13:48.880]  that would pay off the mortgages and then all the credit card debt
[1:13:48.880 --> 1:13:53.360]  they've done the math 12.8 trillion would pay off all mortgages period
[1:13:53.360 --> 1:13:57.440]  every mortgage in america donald trups mortgage your mortgage my mortgage
[1:13:57.440 --> 1:14:03.280]  and all the credit card debt and then some all your credit card debt gone
[1:14:03.280 --> 1:14:06.720]  you would have been paying for it though they're taking it from you and tax money
[1:14:06.720 --> 1:14:12.400]  all the mortgages paid for they have stolen more money than all the mortgages
[1:14:12.400 --> 1:14:15.520]  put together you know that's an article we ought to write i saw those numbers
[1:14:15.520 --> 1:14:18.400]  but we need to point that out before bloomberg does you know they pointed
[1:14:18.400 --> 1:14:22.480]  out when it was 8.7 trillion
[1:14:22.480 --> 1:14:25.680]  two and a half months ago they pointed out in fact here's the exact headline
[1:14:25.680 --> 1:14:28.560]  let me pull up from memory
[1:14:30.960 --> 1:14:37.920]  bailout money would pay off 90 percent of us mortgages
[1:14:37.920 --> 1:14:42.560]  90 percent of all mortgages that's the headline that print that for me
[1:14:42.560 --> 1:14:46.720]  bailout bloomberg bloomberg guys google this bloomberg
[1:14:46.720 --> 1:14:50.960]  everybody else do this we're doing this together bloomberg
[1:14:53.360 --> 1:14:58.400]  uh bailout money would pay off 90 percent of mortgages
[1:14:58.400 --> 1:15:04.720]  now that was at 8.7 trillion i happen to know that the credit card debt
[1:15:04.720 --> 1:15:10.800]  in this country is way less than a trillion
[1:15:10.800 --> 1:15:17.840]  so let's do the math if 8.7 paid off 90 percent
[1:15:17.840 --> 1:15:22.080]  then 10 trillion would have paid off and then some every mortgage in america
[1:15:22.080 --> 1:15:26.560]  and so 10 trillion pays off 100 and then you got 2.8 trillion
[1:15:26.560 --> 1:15:32.640]  which is roughly three times the credit card debt so it would pay off
[1:15:32.640 --> 1:15:35.600]  pull up the college loans i know that's less than a trillion then it would pay
[1:15:35.600 --> 1:15:41.840]  off all the college loans all the credit cards all the mortgages in america
[1:15:41.840 --> 1:15:44.720]  and then some
[1:15:46.160 --> 1:15:50.160]  and you're paying for it in taxes that's why they're raising all the taxes now
[1:15:50.160 --> 1:15:54.960]  and obama lied about that and all and they're just getting started that was
[1:15:54.960 --> 1:15:58.720]  in six months and they're getting ready to accelerate the looting
[1:15:58.720 --> 1:16:02.720]  it's going to be double the gdp at this rate in six more months
[1:16:02.720 --> 1:16:10.640]  double the gdp 26 plus trillion dollars 26 trillion
[1:16:10.640 --> 1:16:14.240]  dollars they're totally raping and looting everything forever
[1:16:14.240 --> 1:16:18.000]  this is already impossible to pay back
[1:16:18.800 --> 1:16:21.600]  and the elite while the money still has value or buying everything up with it
[1:16:21.600 --> 1:16:25.360]  right now and of course they've got all the paid off liberal bloggers and paid
[1:16:25.360 --> 1:16:29.520]  off liberal george soros people attacking us i'm on air saying arrest the
[1:16:29.520 --> 1:16:32.240]  bankers i'm on air saying they've committed crimes
[1:16:32.240 --> 1:16:36.880]  i'm on air saying in the imf documents they blow economies out so bad
[1:16:36.880 --> 1:16:41.040]  then things break down into riots and they call that the imf riot
[1:16:41.040 --> 1:16:44.480]  google that you'll read their own documents bbc news reporting on it
[1:16:44.480 --> 1:16:47.600]  and then when things really break down for a few months then they bring in
[1:16:47.600 --> 1:16:51.440]  martial law and the people beg for it
[1:16:51.440 --> 1:16:54.880]  the everything's already falling apart even the washington post admits that
[1:16:54.880 --> 1:16:58.640]  the mass shootings are because everybody's out of work and going psycho
[1:16:58.640 --> 1:17:01.360]  what's going to happen when you set a six million people out of work you got
[1:17:01.360 --> 1:17:05.600]  30 million people out of work what's going to happen is mexico
[1:17:05.600 --> 1:17:08.320]  collapses and even more illegal aliens run up here
[1:17:08.320 --> 1:17:11.520]  there's dead cops all over the place it's going to be dead military all over
[1:17:11.520 --> 1:17:14.320]  the place they're going to have a marching around trying to take people's
[1:17:14.320 --> 1:17:18.640]  guns in the middle all this as as as mexico collapses the attorney general
[1:17:18.640 --> 1:17:21.440]  already came out in press conferences that we got to restrict the second
[1:17:21.440 --> 1:17:24.160]  amendment because the guns are causing it in mexico
[1:17:24.160 --> 1:17:27.440]  and you know they're going to say take the guns is there's rioting and break
[1:17:27.440 --> 1:17:31.040]  down a society and they're going to march the police right into hell
[1:17:31.040 --> 1:17:34.160]  march the military right into hell because the american people aren't going
[1:17:34.160 --> 1:17:37.920]  to turn their guns in and when there's dead cops in military everywhere
[1:17:37.920 --> 1:17:41.040]  they're going to blame me for trying to stop the bankers
[1:17:41.040 --> 1:17:45.040]  raping us and starting this when it's in their own in f and world bank
[1:17:45.040 --> 1:17:48.560]  documents that they want to have a war between the police and military and the
[1:17:48.560 --> 1:17:52.480]  people it's george soros and david ronkofeller
[1:17:52.480 --> 1:17:55.680]  and bezignia brzezinski
[1:17:55.680 --> 1:18:00.240]  and henry kissinger and the new world order and the cfr the trilateral

[1:18:22.160 --> 1:18:25.760]  i told you as the cops started getting killed that they're going to sit there
[1:18:25.760 --> 1:18:29.760]  and try to go after those of us warning people of how this was all planned
[1:18:29.760 --> 1:18:35.280]  how many times police did i tell you five years ago get out of your mortgage
[1:18:35.280 --> 1:18:38.800]  that was going to be a derivatives crash you did it a lot of you you listened

[1:24:28.640 --> 1:24:34.400]  goes on to attack me the basically the whole article is about me
[1:24:34.400 --> 1:24:38.240]  and it's just disgusting and it says well alex jones generally avoids overt
[1:24:38.240 --> 1:24:41.760]  racism he's found an eager audience on storm front
[1:24:41.760 --> 1:24:45.520]  my conjuring dark visions of an impending new world order no
[1:24:45.520 --> 1:24:48.800]  what's happened is i wake people up to the new world order like no one else i
[1:24:48.800 --> 1:24:50.960]  mean it's admitted by everybody you go out and talk to money
[1:24:50.960 --> 1:24:54.160]  well we'll keep to the new world order oh alex jones alex jones alex jones
[1:24:54.160 --> 1:24:58.720]  it's more than ron paul it's alex jones alex jones alex jones
[1:24:58.720 --> 1:25:03.440]  and uh yeah some of them go and get picked up by
[1:25:03.440 --> 1:25:06.800]  the israeli lobbyist little false paradigm that it's all the vatican
[1:25:06.800 --> 1:25:09.440]  and i'm not saying the vatican is involved in the new world order i'm not
[1:25:09.440 --> 1:25:12.880]  catholic i don't have a dog in the fight that's definitely an israeli operation
[1:25:12.880 --> 1:25:16.000]  that's been proven so they get picked up by that crowd they get picked up by the
[1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:20.800]  anti-semitic crowd uh they get picked up by weird new age ufo crowds but
[1:25:20.800 --> 1:25:24.640]  that's the minority of people most folks wake up and get up to speed and get
[1:25:24.640 --> 1:25:29.120]  smarter and more informed than i am about all this stuff
[1:25:29.120 --> 1:25:32.880]  but uh i mean i can tell you how many people i've woken up or gotten involved
[1:25:32.880 --> 1:25:36.480]  i mean let's just be frank there wouldn't be a movement at this level
[1:25:36.480 --> 1:25:39.680]  if it wasn't for my actions because i realized history
[1:25:39.680 --> 1:25:42.960]  and i realized the power of listeners taking action and being leaders
[1:25:42.960 --> 1:25:46.400]  and viral media and viral videos and making copies of films
[1:25:46.400 --> 1:25:51.520]  and access tv 12 years ago 13 14 years ago telling my listeners on shortwave
[1:25:51.520 --> 1:25:55.920]  and then satellite and internet and am an fm get copies of these out and you
[1:25:55.920 --> 1:25:59.840]  did it and that's why we've had success
[1:25:59.840 --> 1:26:03.200]  you know i studied movements even though i didn't like the iotolica mani i
[1:26:03.200 --> 1:26:06.400]  noticed how they educated folks by handing out
[1:26:06.400 --> 1:26:10.320]  cassette tapes copies of those the person to person
[1:26:10.320 --> 1:26:14.160]  and i said i'm going to do that against the new world order
[1:26:14.160 --> 1:26:18.320]  and so i read history so i knew that you know the ways to do this
[1:26:18.320 --> 1:26:22.560]  and uh so now though i've never been a control freak about it either i just
[1:26:22.560 --> 1:26:26.640]  try to cast the seeds out and how they grow as in you know how they hybridize
[1:26:26.640 --> 1:26:29.280]  or mix with other ideas that's not my issue
[1:26:29.280 --> 1:26:33.440]  justice be done though the heavens fall and they're going to be nuts and
[1:26:33.440 --> 1:26:36.640]  schizophrenics to hear this stuff and get freaked out absolutely but it's not
[1:26:36.640 --> 1:26:39.600]  my fault the government's coming after the second amendment it's not my fault
[1:26:39.600 --> 1:26:42.880]  they're announcing global government or they've imploded the economy and people
[1:26:42.880 --> 1:26:46.000]  are losing their jobs and it's asinine for this corrupt
[1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:50.480]  bankrupt degenerate system to then try to point the finger at me
[1:26:50.480 --> 1:26:54.080]  saying the way out of this is to prosecute the bankers for their crimes
[1:26:54.080 --> 1:26:57.360]  that is the way to end this go the new world order is a hoax it's an illusion
[1:26:57.360 --> 1:27:01.200]  it's a mirage it's a bunch of guys in fancy suits that are criminals
[1:27:01.200 --> 1:27:04.320]  standing around trying to exempt themselves from their own laws
[1:27:04.320 --> 1:27:08.000]  through a global government who happen to be into eugenics
[1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:11.280]  and land grabbing and and and hating their fellow man
[1:27:11.280 --> 1:27:17.200]  which is what elites are always into so that's where i stand on all of this and
[1:27:17.200 --> 1:27:20.080]  this means we're just having more success that we're being attacked
[1:27:20.080 --> 1:27:22.720]  and it's a badge of honor they're trying all of this
[1:27:22.720 --> 1:27:27.680]  um and it's very bracing it's it's not frightening it's not exciting it's
[1:27:27.680 --> 1:27:31.200]  bracing like jumping into freezing water it's very animating
[1:27:31.200 --> 1:27:34.480]  to know we're having this type of effect and no i'm in this position it's an
[1:27:34.480 --> 1:27:38.000]  amazing responsibility
[1:27:38.000 --> 1:27:41.840]  and so you got george soros who told a press conference globe and mail
[1:27:41.840 --> 1:27:46.160]  associated press i'm having a very good crisis as
[1:27:46.160 --> 1:27:50.160]  soros as the hedge fund managers make billions off a session
[1:27:50.160 --> 1:27:53.920]  the george soros went on to say it is the culmination
[1:27:53.920 --> 1:27:58.480]  of my life's work and has been very stimulating that's a quote now that's
[1:27:58.480 --> 1:28:02.640]  who owns in finances these major sites attacking me
[1:28:02.640 --> 1:28:07.120]  including media matters publicly run by soros and he's coming out
[1:28:07.120 --> 1:28:11.280]  with a vicious attack piece doesn't matter of the original newspaper that
[1:28:11.280 --> 1:28:13.280]  got fed this stuff on the southern property law center
[1:28:13.280 --> 1:28:15.840]  has in the pittsburgh post was that has had to admit
[1:28:15.840 --> 1:28:19.680]  oh my gosh alex jones had the white supremacist after him
[1:28:19.680 --> 1:28:22.960]  actually the cop killer didn't like alex and disagree with alex about
[1:28:22.960 --> 1:28:27.120]  non-violence that's all bypassed and the new
[1:28:27.120 --> 1:28:32.000]  articles being written about me linked to the original article
[1:28:32.000 --> 1:28:37.520]  see i have george soros who's having a great time
[1:28:37.520 --> 1:28:41.280]  see he doesn't want you looking at him see i'm on air calling for his arrest
[1:28:41.280 --> 1:28:44.960]  as many other nations are doing not just one individual it's see
[1:28:44.960 --> 1:28:48.560]  that's the reality you are criminals you you're the emperor is butt naked he's
[1:28:48.560 --> 1:28:51.760]  wearing no clothes this is a fraud all i'm doing is saying
[1:28:51.760 --> 1:28:55.280]  those are ponzi scheme scammers who've got dreams
[1:28:55.280 --> 1:29:00.480]  of grandeur delusions of grandeur so big that they're openly doing it and setting
[1:29:00.480 --> 1:29:06.080]  up world government where we're taxed by the very banks that engineered the crisis
[1:29:06.080 --> 1:29:10.240]  now if you want to be part of that fine whether you call yourself a liberal
[1:29:10.240 --> 1:29:14.400]  conservative a libertarian a muslim an atheist it doesn't matter
[1:29:14.400 --> 1:29:18.800]  you know we're all in the crosshairs in the new world order
[1:29:18.800 --> 1:29:22.000]  and i want you all to live free and i want to live free and i know how serious

[1:29:31.040 --> 1:29:33.600]  documents about u.s government funding pull pot

[1:30:19.840 --> 1:30:23.600]  don't call e-foods direct if you think growing food for cars is better than
[1:30:23.600 --> 1:30:26.960]  feeding people don't get food if you think waiting for a cop to show up
[1:30:26.960 --> 1:30:30.080]  after a crime is better than defending yourself and preventing the crime
[1:30:30.080 --> 1:30:34.000]  don't call e-foods direct if you believe the official report on 9 11
[1:30:34.000 --> 1:30:37.520]  you won't need food if you think the warnings on the alex jones show are

[1:33:56.480 --> 1:34:00.880]  i just want to make it clear the establishment did this gamble and is
[1:34:00.880 --> 1:34:07.280]  trying to have a messianic leader to carry out their operations
[1:34:07.280 --> 1:34:11.600]  because they've been exposed their hand has been exposed in this game of poker
[1:34:11.600 --> 1:34:15.840]  and so they're trying to fool people with obama and he's already starting to
[1:34:15.840 --> 1:34:20.480]  stall and run out of gas now that means false flag terror attack
[1:34:20.480 --> 1:34:25.280]  or new wars and or both and so i'm telling you they're getting ready to hit
[1:34:25.280 --> 1:34:28.800]  us right between the eyes these guys want to keep their locomotion going they
[1:34:28.800 --> 1:34:35.120]  want to keep their operation movement and i know how they operate
[1:34:35.120 --> 1:34:38.320]  that's why even michael savages come out and said obama will stage terror
[1:34:38.320 --> 1:34:40.720]  attacks in america to bring in martial law
[1:34:40.720 --> 1:34:43.760]  see he wouldn't say that about 9 11 because that was his precious george
[1:34:43.760 --> 1:34:49.040]  bush but that idea has so gotten into people's
[1:34:49.040 --> 1:34:52.080]  minds and the fact that folks have found operation north woods and all the real
[1:34:52.080 --> 1:34:55.200]  events that were carried out by the military industrial complex by those
[1:34:55.200 --> 1:34:58.560]  that have hijacked our nation
[1:34:58.560 --> 1:35:01.360]  that he's having to talk about and they're having to admit global currency
[1:35:01.360 --> 1:35:06.720]  and world government and that's why this is desperation it's ridiculous
[1:35:06.720 --> 1:35:12.160]  for the new york times and all these big establishment papers to come out and
[1:35:12.160 --> 1:35:15.280]  try to single me out and attack me and make me the big bogeyman
[1:35:15.280 --> 1:35:19.440]  that just shows how pathetic they are they're having to try to discredit me
[1:35:19.440 --> 1:35:23.440]  now as if you can discredit the movement and
[1:35:23.440 --> 1:35:26.960]  the idea it's too late you could make up whatever
[1:35:26.960 --> 1:35:32.720]  you wanted about me it's too late you see if they do kill me or set me up or
[1:35:32.720 --> 1:35:36.480]  destroy me i just want folks to know whatever
[1:35:36.480 --> 1:35:40.400]  happens in the end i win and you win too
[1:35:40.400 --> 1:35:43.600]  as long as the idea lives on as long as humanity moves forward as long as we
[1:35:43.600 --> 1:35:47.360]  bring these criminals to justice as long as the species survives
[1:35:47.360 --> 1:35:50.000]  and then literally the globalists are talking about engineering society getting
[1:35:50.000 --> 1:35:53.680]  rid of most of us you know this transhumanist stuff i mean this is for
[1:35:53.680 --> 1:35:58.240]  all the marbles i win so i mean but i do want it beforehand
[1:35:58.240 --> 1:36:01.920]  to be known that i go into this willingly i mean i don't just think i'm
[1:36:01.920 --> 1:36:05.760]  sticking my head in a meat grinder uh and then ha ha look at him he just got
[1:36:05.760 --> 1:36:10.400]  chewed up i want folks to know i went into this willingly
[1:36:10.400 --> 1:36:14.560]  i want that on record
[1:36:14.720 --> 1:36:18.320]  as an example to you not some people down the road say oh man alex had incredible
[1:36:18.320 --> 1:36:21.040]  courage look what he did he knew what he was doing
[1:36:21.040 --> 1:36:23.600]  because it does take this type of sacrifice at least you know even having
[1:36:23.600 --> 1:36:27.680]  your name destroyed to you know to knock the barbed wire down to go on air
[1:36:27.680 --> 1:36:31.360]  first and say 9 11's an inside job and be attacked by everybody
[1:36:31.360 --> 1:36:36.960]  on the morning it happened in two weeks before a month before two months before
[1:36:36.960 --> 1:36:41.600]  but i did that and i do it on every issue
[1:36:41.600 --> 1:36:45.520]  i come out against obama day one i saw his advisors i saw his policies i saw
[1:36:45.520 --> 1:36:48.480]  what he said he was going to do i said this guy's going to lie to all of you
[1:36:48.480 --> 1:36:54.960]  get ready here's a film bam hit him first boom don't hold back go all the
[1:36:54.960 --> 1:36:57.200]  way
[1:36:58.000 --> 1:37:02.880]  because i don't care about being attacked i don't care about being lied about
[1:37:02.880 --> 1:37:06.160]  now it is more effective to prove they're lying and discredit them and i do
[1:37:06.160 --> 1:37:09.920]  that where i can't but in my core all i care about is
[1:37:09.920 --> 1:37:13.600]  delivering the payload finishing the mission
[1:37:13.600 --> 1:37:20.240]  that's it and so understand i don't want my destruction or my setup
[1:37:20.240 --> 1:37:26.240]  or my death to be seen as a defeat for us
[1:37:26.240 --> 1:37:29.680]  certainly i don't want it to happen and by the fact we're talking about this it
[1:37:29.680 --> 1:37:33.280]  lessens the chance of that happening they want to operate in the dark we
[1:37:33.280 --> 1:37:37.680]  operate in the light that's that's our power darkness is their power
[1:37:37.680 --> 1:37:40.960]  they cheat they lie they don't have to follow the rules
[1:37:40.960 --> 1:37:44.640]  but we got the truth on our side and that's why even though we have to follow
[1:37:44.640 --> 1:37:47.520]  the rules we're stronger than them when we stand up and fight
[1:37:47.520 --> 1:37:54.480]  every single time so understand folks
[1:37:56.080 --> 1:37:59.040]  that we're having great victories they're talking about the world government
[1:37:59.040 --> 1:38:02.480]  everywhere people are waking up people are talking about arresting the bankers
[1:38:02.480 --> 1:38:05.920]  mainstream television is talking about how this is a global takeover if we
[1:38:05.920 --> 1:38:10.320]  identify what's happening it will be politically impossible for them to
[1:38:10.320 --> 1:38:13.360]  carry it out that's why they want to destroy
[1:38:13.360 --> 1:38:17.280]  everything economically so we're so destitute we have to go along with them
[1:38:17.280 --> 1:38:19.680]  but if we're there pointing out how they did that
[1:38:19.680 --> 1:38:23.680]  the calamity they're bringing in financially and the revolution they're
[1:38:23.680 --> 1:38:26.160]  bringing in they're forcing one a violent one
[1:38:26.160 --> 1:38:29.920]  that will be their undoing if we preemptively beforehand
[1:38:29.920 --> 1:38:34.480]  explain what's going on and we've done that and we're going to continue every
[1:38:34.480 --> 1:38:38.080]  person you wake up today every person you reach out to every person's
[1:38:38.080 --> 1:38:43.760]  paradigm you shift and open up and unblind that is one

[1:40:44.640 --> 1:40:47.280]  this stuff and you know people can get their minds around that it's an
[1:40:47.280 --> 1:40:51.280]  operation northwoods how to do a mass shooting and then
[1:40:51.280 --> 1:40:54.720]  blame a patsy how to kill the patsy how to uh
[1:40:54.720 --> 1:40:57.600]  to have a few your own operatives it's always in a government building you
[1:40:57.600 --> 1:41:01.760]  notice who will then say it was the guy that did the shooting
[1:41:01.760 --> 1:41:05.200]  the police always stay outside to make sure all the witnesses die
[1:41:05.200 --> 1:41:08.080]  they got to go in and check the pulse and make sure that all the people that
[1:41:08.080 --> 1:41:12.000]  weren't part of the op die this is so sick and it's always the
[1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:14.800]  same shake and bake
[1:41:14.800 --> 1:41:18.480]  got your red-handed again you bastards
[1:41:18.480 --> 1:41:22.560]  i don't know about what's happening in in in the other deal looks like a spoiled
[1:41:22.560 --> 1:41:27.200]  brat marine corps kill training you know killing inhibition taken away
[1:41:27.200 --> 1:41:30.560]  throwing a fit and killing the cops but we'll keep looking uh you know the point
[1:41:30.560 --> 1:41:33.680]  is with you if the evidence doesn't show that we'll cover it
[1:41:33.680 --> 1:41:38.320]  now i'ma go to your calls i'ma shut up just the issue here is we are winning
[1:41:38.320 --> 1:41:42.320]  we are fighting back and they don't want you talking
[1:41:42.320 --> 1:41:44.960]  about the bankers and the corrupt government and all the horrible things
[1:41:44.960 --> 1:41:46.880]  they're doing they want to demonize the first amendment
[1:41:46.880 --> 1:41:50.240]  and the second amendment they want to shut down the web they want to come after
[1:41:50.240 --> 1:41:53.760]  free speech they're announcing it all so let these idiots say we're lying about
[1:41:53.760 --> 1:41:57.360]  a new world order let them say we're lying about vaccines killing people
[1:41:57.360 --> 1:42:00.800]  let them say we're lying about a north american union let them say we're lying
[1:42:00.800 --> 1:42:03.440]  about a global currency let them say we're lying about
[1:42:03.440 --> 1:42:07.200]  the attorney general calling for total gun ban folks are finding out they're a
[1:42:07.200 --> 1:42:10.560]  pack of liars and they're losing credibility while we gain
[1:42:10.560 --> 1:42:14.080]  credibility
[1:42:14.080 --> 1:42:16.880]  the new world orders are big things they got to write all these white papers
[1:42:16.880 --> 1:42:20.400]  how to carry their ops out these papers are public
[1:42:20.400 --> 1:42:22.960]  so of course we know everything that's going to happen we're reading their own
[1:42:22.960 --> 1:42:29.840]  roadmap and so our credibility rises and rises and rises and rises and rises
[1:42:29.840 --> 1:42:34.960]  and rises and rises and rises and rises and rises i'm only one person that
[1:42:34.960 --> 1:42:38.480]  knew history and knew the power of the individual and that i could take action
[1:42:38.480 --> 1:42:42.320]  look at what i've done think about what you can do if you don't get caught up in
[1:42:42.320 --> 1:42:45.520]  co-intel pro and infighting and all these diversions and distractions
[1:42:45.520 --> 1:42:48.240]  the globalists are just a few thousand that's why they divide and conquerors
[1:42:48.240 --> 1:42:51.280]  if you just stay on bill of rights constitution second amendment the
[1:42:51.280 --> 1:42:54.560]  bankers are criminals arrest the bankers in the new world order no global
[1:42:54.560 --> 1:42:57.920]  currency look at that congresswoman i want to get her on
[1:42:57.920 --> 1:43:02.400]  uh... from uh... minnesota two weeks ago as they're announcing a new global
[1:43:02.400 --> 1:43:05.280]  currency at the cfr she says i will introduce a bill against this
[1:43:05.280 --> 1:43:09.040]  and cnn came out saying she's a crazy woman
[1:43:09.040 --> 1:43:12.000]  what is she uh... she's on screen right now info wars
[1:43:12.000 --> 1:43:16.960]  it's uh... let me go back here
[1:43:16.960 --> 1:43:20.880]  bachmann on obama's reeducation camps click on that but that's a separate
[1:43:20.880 --> 1:43:24.320]  article they're attacking her because she's reading his bills
[1:43:24.320 --> 1:43:27.760]  hr one four four four for these youth brigades
[1:43:27.760 --> 1:43:31.200]  she's reading how they want in their own words of global currency and then they
[1:43:31.200 --> 1:43:35.360]  call her alone you can google her name no google
[1:43:35.360 --> 1:43:39.440]  bachmann uh... you know crazy bachmann believes in global currency
[1:43:39.440 --> 1:43:42.560]  she's a congresswoman she hears them announced she says i'll introduce a
[1:43:42.560 --> 1:43:46.480]  bill and they say she's crazy it doesn't exist
[1:43:46.480 --> 1:43:52.400]  that didn't go to work you idiots you con artist
[1:43:52.400 --> 1:43:56.880]  you know i mean you you've lied so long that's why you're discredited now
[1:43:56.880 --> 1:44:01.200]  all right that's it we're on your calls tony in illinois you're on the air go
[1:44:01.200 --> 1:44:04.240]  ahead
[1:44:04.240 --> 1:44:08.480]  tony thanks for holding a head
[1:44:08.480 --> 1:44:12.880]  now let's move on their christian in mexico you're on the air
[1:44:12.880 --> 1:44:16.080]  morning alex has been about uh... probably four or five years since i've
[1:44:16.080 --> 1:44:20.640]  called into the show and uh... first let me just say that in the last four or
[1:44:20.640 --> 1:44:24.240]  five years every single thing that you've said has been absolutely right on i
[1:44:24.240 --> 1:44:26.880]  can testify to that i've done my homework
[1:44:26.880 --> 1:44:31.520]  it's absolutely right uh... and that there's just no questioning that
[1:44:31.520 --> 1:44:35.600]  uh... you know i i have a tendency to focus on the spiritual side of this
[1:44:35.600 --> 1:44:38.880]  whole thing i don't know if we're ever going to get a chance to you know take
[1:44:38.880 --> 1:44:43.200]  these guys down uh... in a legal way to to string them up and put them in
[1:44:43.200 --> 1:44:47.920]  jail you know but i i don't like i went to uh... david ike's website
[1:44:47.920 --> 1:44:53.280]  yesterday and something caught my eye on his page he said do not riot
[1:44:53.280 --> 1:44:56.880]  and you know alex that that really hit me
[1:44:56.880 --> 1:45:00.480]  look at what happened at the g twenty all those people that were out there with
[1:45:00.480 --> 1:45:04.720]  their signs in their banners and carry it on and rioting and then demonstrating
[1:45:04.720 --> 1:45:09.520]  they accomplished nothing they didn't accomplish a thing all they did was
[1:45:09.520 --> 1:45:12.480]  dissipate their energy into the atmosphere and it's gone
[1:45:12.480 --> 1:45:16.640]  the pressure went off but but the lid and it
[1:45:16.640 --> 1:45:20.560]  nothing got done you know david ike is right about that
[1:45:20.560 --> 1:45:24.720]  don't riot we know who the enemy is we know their names we know the names of
[1:45:24.720 --> 1:45:28.480]  their corporations we know where they are and who they are
[1:45:28.480 --> 1:45:32.640]  and after food and water and guns and ammo in that order
[1:45:32.640 --> 1:45:36.880]  the next most important thing you have once it does hit the fan and then it
[1:45:36.880 --> 1:45:40.720]  all breaks loose and it's you know katie bar the door
[1:45:40.720 --> 1:45:43.920]  the most important thing that you can own is a book of matches
[1:45:43.920 --> 1:45:48.960]  or a lighter you know i mean you can do a lot of damage with one book of
[1:45:48.960 --> 1:45:53.120]  matches and i want your thoughts on that
[1:45:53.120 --> 1:45:56.400]  well that's all point we cannot be dominated
[1:45:56.400 --> 1:45:59.440]  if we have a will to fight and i appreciate your call let me let me
[1:45:59.440 --> 1:46:02.560]  comment on all this right now
[1:46:03.680 --> 1:46:07.520]  the left-controlled foundations always finance
[1:46:07.520 --> 1:46:13.280]  demonstrations because the media can point its camera at people
[1:46:13.280 --> 1:46:17.120]  dressed like clowns and even pay groups to go dress like wizards and
[1:46:17.120 --> 1:46:20.800]  do levitations of the mint you know to discredit everybody and they put that on
[1:46:20.800 --> 1:46:24.880]  the news look these delusionals think they can levitate the men
[1:46:24.880 --> 1:46:28.080]  and the Denver Post said that i was leading a demonstration
[1:46:28.080 --> 1:46:32.400]  that i believed i was a jedi lifting the men now i was there
[1:46:32.400 --> 1:46:36.880]  videotaping the foundation cooks they were attacking me and hitting me i
[1:46:36.880 --> 1:46:39.680]  clearly wasn't with them doesn't matter i believe i levitate
[1:46:39.680 --> 1:46:43.600]  mint see and i said kill michelle malcom
[1:46:43.600 --> 1:46:47.200]  but i didn't say that and they had to retract it later but nobody reads the
[1:46:47.200 --> 1:46:52.160]  retractions so another example of that
[1:46:52.160 --> 1:46:55.360]  notice there's all those news cameras the cops stand down three guys go up and
[1:46:55.360 --> 1:46:59.680]  bust the window out they let them go in and out of the bank they let them leave
[1:47:00.880 --> 1:47:03.840]  but meanwhile they beat some innocent mail carrier
[1:47:03.840 --> 1:47:08.480]  or newspaper carrier delivering newspapers to death
[1:47:08.480 --> 1:47:11.120]  this is how they operate they've been caught parochetering all over the
[1:47:11.120 --> 1:47:14.320]  planet i mean on record
[1:47:15.680 --> 1:47:20.320]  so you're absolutely right you're absolutely on target
[1:47:20.320 --> 1:47:22.960]  when you say don't riot notice how they're saying there's going to be riots
[1:47:22.960 --> 1:47:25.840]  riots it's all over the newspaper every day there's going to be riots riots
[1:47:25.840 --> 1:47:30.000]  and when there's riots north com has to come in and north com has to have
[1:47:30.000 --> 1:47:36.080]  martial law only for your safety no you don't want riots
[1:47:36.080 --> 1:47:39.280]  but they know when the economic collapse it's going to lead to that
[1:47:39.280 --> 1:47:43.600]  and then they use that to have crackdowns and greater control
[1:47:43.600 --> 1:47:46.640]  now that does turn into a nazi germany situation they're arresting people
[1:47:46.640 --> 1:47:50.640]  taking them to camps taking their guns it is your right and duty declaration
[1:47:50.640 --> 1:47:54.400]  of independence all the rest of it to defend yourselves and that's the real
[1:47:54.400 --> 1:48:00.560]  militia the constitutional militia all men 18 to 49
[1:48:00.560 --> 1:48:04.480]  not the counterfeit fbi adl southern parvy law center militia
[1:48:04.480 --> 1:48:08.080]  where they go out and create the viper militia out of a drug dealing street
[1:48:08.080 --> 1:48:10.800]  gang and then set them up or create a clan group
[1:48:10.800 --> 1:48:14.000]  up in fort worth uh... that was in the uh...
[1:48:14.000 --> 1:48:17.920]  1998 bomb scare awards in the
[1:48:17.920 --> 1:48:22.960]  semi-film police did the takeover it's uh... in uh...
[1:48:22.960 --> 1:48:26.960]  texas monthly that's the fake militia we're talking about
[1:48:26.960 --> 1:48:30.240]  they've created not the real militia people saw clinton with his gun
[1:48:30.240 --> 1:48:32.880]  control and gun confiscation speeches on mtv
[1:48:32.880 --> 1:48:36.000]  they said we got a form up to defend this that's the declaration of
[1:48:36.000 --> 1:48:38.400]  independence says we're supposed to do
[1:48:38.400 --> 1:48:42.160]  don't let the media tie us to some white supremacists throwing a fit with mommy
[1:48:42.160 --> 1:48:46.000]  with his pit bulls urinating everywhere so he throws a fit and shoots some cops
[1:48:46.000 --> 1:48:49.920]  in a fit of anger and the media tries to tie that to us that are
[1:48:49.920 --> 1:48:53.200]  peacefully saying no but we're not going to go to fema camps we're not going to
[1:48:53.200 --> 1:48:55.440]  turn our guns in
[1:48:55.440 --> 1:48:58.240]  i mean to the people in the war saw ghetto and nazi germany have a right to
[1:48:58.240 --> 1:49:01.920]  fight back according to uh... the george soros people know
[1:49:01.920 --> 1:49:04.880]  you do what government says you there is no right anywhere
[1:49:04.880 --> 1:49:08.240]  to throw off tyranny the founding fathers were bad that's why fema teaches
[1:49:08.240 --> 1:49:10.720]  that they don't want you to understand that
[1:49:10.720 --> 1:49:14.240]  that yes if they're going door to door taking guns
[1:49:14.240 --> 1:49:18.560]  and they are taking people to fema camps you have absolute authorization
[1:49:18.560 --> 1:49:22.000]  under god the constitution bill of rights and everybody all the angels watching
[1:49:22.000 --> 1:49:27.840]  to defend yourself so see they want to keep you in this primitive
[1:49:27.840 --> 1:49:30.800]  two-dimensional thinking to say oh look it's bad for you to ever defend
[1:49:30.800 --> 1:49:33.360]  yourself tying it to the zit faced white supremacist
[1:49:33.360 --> 1:49:38.000]  who was attacking me
[1:49:38.000 --> 1:49:41.120]  but it is true that you know they could take all your guns anyways if the
[1:49:41.120 --> 1:49:44.000]  tyranny really gets bad with a knife you can take
[1:49:44.000 --> 1:49:47.840]  guns from anybody and defend yourself it's all about the will the engine to
[1:49:47.840 --> 1:49:51.360]  resist that's why they're putting in face scanning
[1:49:51.360 --> 1:49:55.440]  cameras and pentagon design grids and aerial blimp scanning and
[1:49:55.440 --> 1:49:59.280]  all the license plate readers and you know all of these things to lock down
[1:49:59.280 --> 1:50:03.120]  highways automatically because they plan to do some really horrible stuff here
[1:50:03.120 --> 1:50:06.400]  it's their nature they hate america they hate freedom they hate liberty
[1:50:06.400 --> 1:50:09.040]  they are the new world order they want to re-engineer the society
[1:50:09.040 --> 1:50:12.640]  we're the big plumb we're the big target they want to gut this place with
[1:50:12.640 --> 1:50:16.160]  revolution let's not have the revolution what if they
[1:50:16.160 --> 1:50:19.600]  wanted i mean what if the globalist had to put on
[1:50:19.600 --> 1:50:23.760]  a collapse of society and in blood in the streets and nobody showed up
[1:50:23.760 --> 1:50:26.560]  well they're going to take the few cops that get killed the few military that
[1:50:26.560 --> 1:50:29.600]  get killed you put enough military out at checkpoint searching cars it's going
[1:50:29.600 --> 1:50:33.840]  to happen it's going on everywhere what if that just

[1:54:17.600 --> 1:54:21.760]  Barack Obama for going back on every promise
[1:54:23.040 --> 1:54:26.000]  i know some people didn't know Keith Oberman in hollywood i'll just leave it
[1:54:26.000 --> 1:54:32.880]  that and he knows 9-11's an inside job he is a
[1:54:32.880 --> 1:54:35.520]  liberal but he is now coming out and attacking
[1:54:35.520 --> 1:54:39.600]  morocco obama on the warrant with spying and continuing all the immunity
[1:54:39.600 --> 1:54:45.360]  claims of bush and chaining so he is now going after obama
[1:54:45.360 --> 1:54:52.480]  almost every night so uh Keith Oberman i don't expect he'll be an msnbc very long
[1:54:52.480 --> 1:54:57.280]  because uh... you know or maybe the establishment doesn't care if obama gets
[1:54:57.280 --> 1:54:59.680]  destroyed politically because they know they just don't care they're just moving
[1:54:59.680 --> 1:55:03.920]  forward they just don't care
[1:55:03.920 --> 1:55:10.640]  Keith Oberman's scathing criticism of obama's security immunity claims
[1:55:10.640 --> 1:55:14.960]  of course the republicans can't really criticize any of that because obama
[1:55:14.960 --> 1:55:18.880]  is continuing everything that they're doing
[1:55:18.880 --> 1:55:22.560]  and so they're kind of like hey the neocons are hey we like obama
[1:55:22.560 --> 1:55:26.080]  we're gonna get the oath keepers going on about 15 ather because i want to go
[1:55:26.080 --> 1:55:29.120]  to uh so call him and let him know that please john i want to go to gary and
[1:55:29.120 --> 1:55:33.520]  kathleen matt nander instead before that um
[1:55:33.520 --> 1:55:37.520]  i got a bunch of other insane news here gloom grips markets brace for us
[1:55:37.520 --> 1:55:42.320]  earnings season market bear rubini sticks to

[1:55:47.520 --> 1:55:50.480]  i mean it's over for us folks unless we arrest these bankers
[1:55:50.480 --> 1:55:54.240]  they don't care about the country it's over you understand
[1:55:54.240 --> 1:55:57.760]  unless you grow up i'm talking to all the liberals and conservatives out there
[1:55:57.760 --> 1:56:02.240]  mortgage and link would see sore in the u.s to record levels
[1:56:02.240 --> 1:56:10.400]  bow to obama's painful missteps that's uh out of salon yeah i saw this video
[1:56:10.400 --> 1:56:14.480]  where he bows to the saudi king he also starts
[1:56:14.480 --> 1:56:17.680]  cursing to the queen and then he's being bossed around they're just like turn
[1:56:17.680 --> 1:56:21.360]  around and he's like oh i met with world leaders they said oh do you know who
[1:56:21.360 --> 1:56:24.880]  they are just just i mean he's there to be humiliated
[1:56:24.880 --> 1:56:27.280]  folks
[1:56:28.560 --> 1:56:32.480]  because the globalists are virulent racist
[1:56:32.480 --> 1:56:36.960]  they hate black people and even though obama's
[1:56:36.960 --> 1:56:43.760]  50 white and the other half 90 arab that's right i actually pulled up his
[1:56:43.760 --> 1:56:48.960]  exact racial makeup he's 6.3 african
[1:56:48.960 --> 1:56:52.320]  six is where we're making an issue of this the new film not not that it matters
[1:56:52.320 --> 1:56:55.840]  but but it's another hoax he's not a black guy
[1:56:55.840 --> 1:57:00.160]  he's not a black guy i mean i guess if you're 6.3
[1:57:00.160 --> 1:57:04.640]  i mean if i was 6.3 percent black
[1:57:04.720 --> 1:57:12.480]  what would that make me black 6.3 out of 100 he's 90
[1:57:12.480 --> 1:57:18.160]  3 plus percent non-african
[1:57:19.120 --> 1:57:22.640]  now the black genes are the strong genes in coloration
[1:57:22.640 --> 1:57:26.320]  hair and pigment that's how it expresses itself
[1:57:26.320 --> 1:57:30.400]  that is dominant in all mammal species the pigment
[1:57:30.400 --> 1:57:34.800]  that's it so i mean i guess because he's got a chestnut paint job it's over
[1:57:34.800 --> 1:57:39.280]  it's a white guy we might as well just uh you know you got the pink white people
[1:57:39.280 --> 1:57:42.480]  not really white or pink little piggy creatures and then you got you know
[1:57:42.480 --> 1:57:45.600]  folks with a tan and who cares it's just
[1:57:45.600 --> 1:57:50.800]  people's pigment so why don't we just put george w bush up there
[1:57:50.800 --> 1:57:54.480]  and put him in and put some brown makeup on him
[1:57:54.480 --> 1:57:59.120]  because barack obama is not black ladies and gentlemen

[2:06:13.680 --> 2:06:16.960]  the obama deception completely destroys the myth
[2:06:16.960 --> 2:06:20.160]  that obama is working for the best interest of the american people
[2:06:20.160 --> 2:06:24.880]  well obama's already fudging yeah fudged since d1 in this election if you

[2:06:37.760 --> 2:06:41.360]  it's not about left or right it's about a one-world government

[2:08:18.080 --> 2:08:23.680]  and now live from austin texas alex jones
[2:08:23.680 --> 2:08:28.080]  we have a chemtrail guest with chemtrail watch
[2:08:28.080 --> 2:08:35.520]  on the show tomorrow chemtrails are real until 1996
[2:08:35.520 --> 2:08:41.600]  all condensation ice crystal trails only formed at 20 000 feet and higher
[2:08:41.600 --> 2:08:45.200]  generally in the winter months and they faded out in a few seconds
[2:08:45.200 --> 2:08:49.360]  to the maximum of one minute your whole life remember watching a trail go by and
[2:08:49.360 --> 2:08:56.480]  watching it disappear then suddenly in 96 before anybody was even talking
[2:08:56.480 --> 2:09:00.000]  about chemtrails i would notice man why did those stay there i'd be
[2:09:00.000 --> 2:09:03.280]  you know uh gardening because my parents had a couple acres of mental town i would
[2:09:03.280 --> 2:09:07.840]  go garden i like planting stuff call me a weirdo
[2:09:07.840 --> 2:09:11.360]  but i'd be out there growing watermelons and stuff and stomping around
[2:09:11.360 --> 2:09:14.720]  and the flowers and the bees and i'd go man that trail's been there for like an
[2:09:14.720 --> 2:09:18.080]  hour and it's getting bigger turning into a cloud what's going on it's a cloud
[2:09:18.080 --> 2:09:22.160]  seating and then by 97 chemtrails chemtrails and they added to the jet
[2:09:22.160 --> 2:09:25.440]  fuel so it's compartmentalized the pilots don't even know and they have some
[2:09:25.440 --> 2:09:29.040]  others where they do know and they're spraying off uh... you know larger
[2:09:29.040 --> 2:09:32.080]  amounts
[2:09:32.080 --> 2:09:35.520]  and then suddenly government textbooks started admitting three years ago that
[2:09:35.520 --> 2:09:38.080]  they really were spraying the atmosphere to save us from
[2:09:38.080 --> 2:09:41.200]  the sun's rays and to fix the ozone layer
[2:09:41.200 --> 2:09:45.200]  and paul watson i'm trying to google it during the break he wrote a big article
[2:09:45.200 --> 2:09:49.360]  six months ago or so where the government admitted the chemtrails and we
[2:09:49.360 --> 2:09:52.400]  had links to the government admitting yes we've got
[2:09:52.400 --> 2:09:56.320]  thousands of uh... flights a year or spraying the atmosphere testing
[2:09:56.320 --> 2:09:59.440]  terraforming to save the earth from global warming
[2:09:59.440 --> 2:10:03.280]  and then nasa admitted uh... a few years ago that the earth is 20 percent
[2:10:03.280 --> 2:10:07.280]  darker now than it was before the nineteen ninety five
[2:10:07.280 --> 2:10:10.800]  and then you show the satellite photos of the chemtrails sprays everywhere
[2:10:10.800 --> 2:10:15.120]  how all the lines like spider webs cover up cities
[2:10:15.120 --> 2:10:20.160]  i mean they are manipulating the planet well here's associated press a p
[2:10:20.160 --> 2:10:22.880]  exist you know it looks like when a p announces
[2:10:22.880 --> 2:10:25.040]  they're setting up global government global currency
[2:10:25.040 --> 2:10:29.520]  i get attacked and they say no it doesn't exist i mean literally
[2:10:29.520 --> 2:10:34.400]  now this is a p and we're live at prison planet dot tv now right
[2:10:34.400 --> 2:10:37.920]  we are live okay we will have a day after i'm in front of the camera so much
[2:10:37.920 --> 2:10:43.120]  i don't even know anymore um... a p news break obama looks at climate
[2:10:43.120 --> 2:10:49.200]  engineering now i want paul watson on this now i want chemtrail every day
[2:10:49.200 --> 2:10:52.080]  in fact when i'm done with this next obama film i'm doing a chemtrail film
[2:10:52.080 --> 2:10:56.160]  that said i've made my mind up i was going to make the 2012 film explaining
[2:10:56.160 --> 2:11:00.560]  how that's all the globalist hoax but i can that that can wait
[2:11:00.560 --> 2:11:03.360]  and everybody starts sending me your chemtrail footage and will give you
[2:11:03.360 --> 2:11:05.680]  full credit everything from all over the country
[2:11:05.680 --> 2:11:08.400]  to send your chemtrail footage i'm making a chemtrail film that's it
[2:11:08.400 --> 2:11:11.760]  because because it's in i should have made it a year ago
[2:11:11.760 --> 2:11:14.800]  when they were admitting it in textbooks and things because it really hurts the
[2:11:14.800 --> 2:11:17.760]  globalist to make a film and have them deny it and then have it be all admitted
[2:11:17.760 --> 2:11:21.200]  but but even when i had document what's admitted now they're going to say it
[2:11:21.200 --> 2:11:23.760]  doesn't exist the president's new science advisors
[2:11:23.760 --> 2:11:26.480]  at wednesday the global warming is so dire the obama administration is
[2:11:26.480 --> 2:11:29.200]  discussing radical technologies to cool the earth's air
[2:11:29.200 --> 2:11:32.720]  and see this is in the university reports paul's report on oh we're spraying
[2:11:32.720 --> 2:11:35.040]  the atmosphere testing shielding the earth and
[2:11:35.040 --> 2:11:38.320]  kids textbooks that have chapters saying new world order
[2:11:38.320 --> 2:11:43.040]  say oh and we're spraying you those are that sunscreen spray
[2:11:43.040 --> 2:11:46.960]  so paul watson is now up on air we're multitasking on air
[2:11:46.960 --> 2:11:52.400]  paul watson my chief researcher and writer i have you here with a new mission
[2:11:52.400 --> 2:11:55.840]  should you choose to accept it are you there my friend
[2:11:55.840 --> 2:12:01.600]  yes i need you to do an article saying yes they are terraforming the planet
[2:12:01.600 --> 2:12:05.280]  chemtrails are real not only one component is the terraforming they're
[2:12:05.280 --> 2:12:09.600]  also spraying poisons on you that sterilize you and brain damage you and
[2:12:09.600 --> 2:12:12.000]  i know you don't want to admit that public it's because you've been brain
[2:12:12.000 --> 2:12:15.280]  damaged but myself included but i'm fighting through it you can still
[2:12:15.280 --> 2:12:20.240]  focus and get some neurons firing there you know we're trying
[2:12:20.240 --> 2:12:24.720]  um john holdren the the told the ap the first
[2:12:24.720 --> 2:12:28.000]  interviews is becoming confirmed last month that the idea of geoengineering
[2:12:28.000 --> 2:12:32.880]  the climate is being discussed one such extreme option includes shooting
[2:12:32.880 --> 2:12:36.000]  pollution particles in the upper atmosphere to reflect the sun's rays
[2:12:36.000 --> 2:12:39.600]  holdren said such an experiment measure would only be used as last resort
[2:12:39.600 --> 2:12:43.680]  it's already going on globally the operation was launched worldwide
[2:12:43.680 --> 2:12:48.800]  in 1996 worldwide terraforming
[2:12:48.800 --> 2:12:52.240]  with deadly barium salts and aluminum dioxide
[2:12:52.240 --> 2:12:55.360]  as now people 22 years older getting Alzheimer's everywhere
[2:12:55.360 --> 2:12:59.280]  just breathing it is uh mass death brain plaques
[2:12:59.280 --> 2:13:02.320]  hitting us hitting us hard i mean the globalists have special detoxes they do
[2:13:02.320 --> 2:13:04.960]  that can remove some of it but they're even saying it's hurting them
[2:13:04.960 --> 2:13:11.600]  i mean this is mega attack total and ap and i i've got fbi calling the
[2:13:11.600 --> 2:13:15.120]  office and circling the office and revocateurs out the wazoo and people
[2:13:15.120 --> 2:13:18.240]  attacking everywhere and i mean and i'm the weirdo because
[2:13:18.240 --> 2:13:21.120]  no listen i'm breaking people out of their trance
[2:13:21.120 --> 2:13:24.480]  see i'm i'm broken out of the trance i'm angry i'm freaked out i'm going my
[2:13:24.480 --> 2:13:28.240]  god they're terraforming my god sodium fluoride in the water my god they
[2:13:28.240 --> 2:13:32.960]  they funded headler my you know i am i understand what's going on
[2:13:32.960 --> 2:13:36.640]  i read their eugenics documents the heron back of my neck standing up right
[2:13:36.640 --> 2:13:40.320]  now i want to warn you they should all arrest them arrest the bankers
[2:13:40.320 --> 2:13:44.640]  they're wrong i can't believe it and then they admit
[2:13:44.640 --> 2:13:47.520]  this is just like after they've been spying on us without warrants for decades
[2:13:47.520 --> 2:13:50.320]  to come out and say we might do a little spying without warrants we want to pass
[2:13:50.320 --> 2:13:55.280]  a law now or um oh we want a global currency
[2:13:55.280 --> 2:13:58.880]  want to pass a law when they've already been having it for years
[2:13:58.880 --> 2:14:06.640]  at the monetary level i'm going to shut up paul paul i just
[2:14:06.640 --> 2:14:09.920]  i just can't believe they're they're admitting it all man
[2:14:09.920 --> 2:14:13.760]  they're admitting it and when they start admitting stuff it means they're
[2:14:13.760 --> 2:14:17.360]  going full steam ahead watch and what do you think of this
[2:14:17.360 --> 2:14:21.680]  well yeah i wrote two articles on this last year
[2:14:21.680 --> 2:14:27.120]  one was a government scientist proposed geoengineering earth upper
[2:14:27.120 --> 2:14:31.520]  atmosphere and this was about um documents that were
[2:14:31.520 --> 2:14:35.840]  obtained by cybercast news service from the um
[2:14:35.840 --> 2:14:41.920]  u.s. department of energy savannah river national laboratory in
[2:14:41.920 --> 2:14:47.040]  aching south carolina but that's not the key that's not the key
[2:14:47.040 --> 2:14:51.200]  you found we found thanks to listeners thousands of university reports how
[2:14:51.200 --> 2:14:54.880]  they're already spraying under department of energy
[2:14:54.880 --> 2:14:59.840]  well this one was about conducting tests about firing
[2:14:59.840 --> 2:15:03.920]  what would happen if a huge amount of particulate matter is shot into the
[2:15:03.920 --> 2:15:07.520]  stratosphere the quote and they say they're testing that's right
[2:15:07.520 --> 2:15:11.600]  all of this spraying like hiv is a weaker virus to the real
[2:15:11.600 --> 2:15:14.880]  when they're going to release it's a beta test
[2:15:14.880 --> 2:15:18.880]  but but yes but they admit thousands of ongoing tests with mixing it with a jet
[2:15:18.880 --> 2:15:22.400]  fuel spraying the particulates into the atmosphere
[2:15:22.400 --> 2:15:26.000]  i mean that's what they're doing that's why you see it's real it's in the
[2:15:26.000 --> 2:15:30.240]  associated press i keep telling you oh god
[2:15:30.240 --> 2:15:35.280]  so there's also a an article out the garden called geoengineering the radical
[2:15:35.280 --> 2:15:40.560]  ideas to combat global warming where ken calvira
[2:15:40.560 --> 2:15:45.280]  who was at the carnage institution in stanford california
[2:15:45.280 --> 2:15:49.360]  promoted injecting the atmosphere with aerosols
[2:15:49.360 --> 2:15:56.400]  as well as um sulfur which in this article we list the uh
[2:15:56.400 --> 2:16:01.760]  health effects the adverse health effects of the exposure to sulfur
[2:16:01.760 --> 2:16:05.120]  neurological effects and behavioral changes
[2:16:05.120 --> 2:16:09.360]  disturbance of blood circulation heart damage effects on eyes and eyesight
[2:16:09.360 --> 2:16:12.720]  look what they're doing what they're doing what they're doing is saying
[2:16:12.720 --> 2:16:17.280]  we're going to medicate you and again you know that's why i was oh they're
[2:16:17.280 --> 2:16:20.880]  spraying with town for a deadly moth this week and i i pulled up at 3 a.m
[2:16:20.880 --> 2:16:24.240]  one morning and saw a sesna file over with spray tanks spraying and i was
[2:16:24.240 --> 2:16:27.920]  like like 200 feet off the ground right over my house
[2:16:27.920 --> 2:16:31.040]  spraying and i could just stood outside smoking a cigarette before i quit
[2:16:31.040 --> 2:16:34.080]  smoking and smelled the pesticide coming down

[2:24:28.880 --> 2:24:31.840]  just like they would deny there was a government plan to microchip the kids
[2:24:31.840 --> 2:24:35.600]  and then time magazine and newsweek for kids they give them free and public
[2:24:35.600 --> 2:24:38.800]  schools say oh you're cool you're not like your parents you're not
[2:24:38.800 --> 2:24:42.400]  backwards you're gonna take the chip that's a quote by the way from time

[2:24:46.560 --> 2:24:49.840]  uh and now the mexican attorney generals made his employees take it they're
[2:24:49.840 --> 2:24:52.080]  pushing it on all simers patients the point is
[2:24:52.080 --> 2:24:54.800]  they brainwash the kids first there's a bunch of government textbooks and
[2:24:54.800 --> 2:24:58.000]  others that admit their chemtrail spring
[2:24:58.000 --> 2:25:01.520]  now we found all the government documents where they admit they're already
[2:25:01.520 --> 2:25:08.320]  terraforming the atmosphere since 96 guess what when we found out the term
[2:25:08.320 --> 2:25:12.320]  indirect and direct aerosol spray campaign you just google that you'll be on
[2:25:12.320 --> 2:25:16.000]  department of energy british department of energy
[2:25:16.000 --> 2:25:19.600]  and i hate to have my guests waiting and then going off and this is just too big
[2:25:19.600 --> 2:25:22.640]  and then the last few months they had a london guardian and ap come out and say
[2:25:22.640 --> 2:25:25.200]  oh they're looking at spraying barium salts
[2:25:25.200 --> 2:25:29.040]  and they can mix it with the jet fuel that way it's cheaply done
[2:25:29.040 --> 2:25:32.640]  and it'll have a big effect over the airwaves to to protect our cities
[2:25:32.640 --> 2:25:35.840]  they're already doing it
[2:25:36.560 --> 2:25:40.880]  and nasa reports the plan is 20 darker than it was
[2:25:40.880 --> 2:25:45.600]  back in the early 90s they are spraying then they turn into clouds it's cloud
[2:25:45.600 --> 2:25:51.840]  seating we broke ben livingston we broke that story before
[2:25:51.840 --> 2:25:55.520]  fox ap any of them we a lister sentenced to declassified document that the
[2:25:55.520 --> 2:26:01.200]  government had put out it had been 40 something years so they declassified it
[2:26:01.200 --> 2:26:04.160]  and in the declassified government document
[2:26:04.160 --> 2:26:07.760]  they talked about how he created hurricanes killed hurricanes weakened
[2:26:07.760 --> 2:26:11.600]  hurricanes how will just a few airplanes they could do this
[2:26:11.600 --> 2:26:14.800]  he ran the attacks he would lead the squadrons
[2:26:14.800 --> 2:26:18.880]  in he was a combat pilot before that uh... in korea
[2:26:18.880 --> 2:26:23.120]  amazing guy he would lead the combat squadrons into vietnam with no clouds
[2:26:23.120 --> 2:26:28.240]  they would rain 10 feet of water on the ho Chi Minh trail
[2:26:28.240 --> 2:26:30.960]  and uh... he interviewed us and then he got threatened and he won't come on
[2:26:30.960 --> 2:26:33.280]  anymore he said no i've been you know basically threatened i can't come back
[2:26:33.280 --> 2:26:36.400]  on the show mr jones because we got him on it broke and then ap and
[2:26:36.400 --> 2:26:40.720]  everybody picked it up but the issue is
[2:26:40.720 --> 2:26:44.720]  that that that that this is barium salts aluminum
[2:26:44.720 --> 2:26:50.560]  dioxide these are nuclei what forms clouds
[2:26:50.560 --> 2:26:55.760]  and now a p you know you know i apologize to stewart rhodes about
[2:26:55.760 --> 2:26:58.880]  i bet he had a big response the last time he was on for both keepers
[2:26:58.880 --> 2:27:02.160]  uh... they're having a big move to get even more people out to take the oath
[2:27:02.160 --> 2:27:06.800]  against firing on a mu s citizens confiscating guns doing things like that
[2:27:06.800 --> 2:27:11.760]  but side issues steward uh... what do you think of them openly announcing
[2:27:11.760 --> 2:27:15.120]  that they're terraforming the planet
[2:27:15.120 --> 2:27:18.560]  i just came on i just got the tail end of your of your uh... discussion about
[2:27:18.560 --> 2:27:22.160]  that that's pretty amazing so i'll put out the
[2:27:22.160 --> 2:27:25.120]  uh... deferential i've listened to the rest of what you said
[2:27:25.120 --> 2:27:27.360]  all right well we're going to come back to you and give you some time to talk and
[2:27:27.360 --> 2:27:30.000]  i want to be back up for a full hour in the near future after this happened
[2:27:30.000 --> 2:27:33.280]  in a nutshell tell us about oath keepers very exciting
[2:27:33.280 --> 2:27:37.760]  uh... so the so the police and military uphold their oath
[2:27:37.760 --> 2:27:41.680]  and don't go to war with the people which will also be very healthy for them
[2:27:41.680 --> 2:27:45.440]  absolutely the movement this is our mission is to as i told you last time
[2:27:45.440 --> 2:27:48.720]  is to make sure that you know the members of the guns are on our side
[2:27:48.720 --> 2:27:51.120]  and the response has been amazing and uh...
[2:27:51.120 --> 2:27:55.360]  what they want listeners to know about is is we are rallying on lexington green
[2:27:55.360 --> 2:27:59.200]  on april the nineteenth which is the anniversary of the first shot
[2:27:59.200 --> 2:28:02.000]  in the american revolution the shot around the world

[2:28:14.400 --> 2:28:17.360]  constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic

[2:34:23.360 --> 2:34:28.000]  line who does a radio show um too much is going on during these
[2:34:28.000 --> 2:34:32.080]  breaks there's a radio show in new orleans a great job
[2:34:32.080 --> 2:34:38.160]  they were searching around and found a job placement order for pilots to fly
[2:34:38.160 --> 2:34:42.800]  these planes during the chem trail spring but we're trying to vet that that
[2:34:42.800 --> 2:34:45.120]  job placement place gary i know you're listening

[2:34:51.760 --> 2:34:54.880]  linking to something else but that's a little bit of a questionable operation
[2:34:54.880 --> 2:34:58.160]  probably an operative group it's from what i've seen the past
[2:34:58.160 --> 2:35:03.200]  this is it's an infighting specialty group so i want to uh...
[2:35:03.200 --> 2:35:07.200]  go to the job placement myself because i mean we have all this mainstream stuff
[2:35:07.200 --> 2:35:09.920]  where it where they're announcing their chem trailing is for our health and
[2:35:09.920 --> 2:35:13.760]  safety and so i want to watch them doing poison the
[2:35:13.760 --> 2:35:15.920]  well op so send that right now

[2:36:43.760 --> 2:36:47.120]  decided to turn around and invite all the health keepers to come in
[2:36:47.120 --> 2:36:50.320]  and do a muster and we're going to reaffirm our oaths right there on the
[2:36:50.320 --> 2:36:53.280]  green you're going to have active duty military police and veterans

[2:37:01.360 --> 2:37:04.400]  and what better place to do it if it's sacred ground

[2:37:08.720 --> 2:37:13.440]  and what better place to throw down the gauntlet and let them
[2:37:13.440 --> 2:37:17.360]  you know those powers that be know that it's not going down the way they think
[2:37:17.360 --> 2:37:21.120]  it's absolutely and again evan veera evan veera constitutional lawyer
[2:37:21.120 --> 2:37:24.160]  constitutional law scholar routine guest here with us an amazing individual
[2:37:24.160 --> 2:37:26.880]  the other gentleman of where his work great work as well
[2:37:26.880 --> 2:37:29.920]  and we try to and i know the listeners have been trying to you know really
[2:37:29.920 --> 2:37:34.080]  energize uh... their committees of safety that's what began as you know
[2:37:34.080 --> 2:37:38.160]  but for listeners who may not in the decade before seventeen seventy five
[2:37:38.160 --> 2:37:42.160]  and the sons of liberty as the tyranny got worse and worse
[2:37:42.160 --> 2:37:46.000]  they began to organize in petition and put out the information and say look
[2:37:46.000 --> 2:37:48.400]  you're committing crimes you're abusing as you better stop
[2:37:48.400 --> 2:37:53.520]  better stop better stop and the crown said how dare you resist us how dare you
[2:37:53.520 --> 2:37:56.160]  criticize us uh... you know how dare you call for
[2:37:56.160 --> 2:37:59.040]  resisting us that's treason same stuff we're hearing now
[2:37:59.040 --> 2:38:04.400]  and i want to call out uh... doctor uh... evan veera and others is is just
[2:38:04.400 --> 2:38:08.240]  great founding patriots when clinton was trying gun confiscations and announcing
[2:38:08.240 --> 2:38:11.440]  on mtv they were going to ban the guns and all of this
[2:38:11.440 --> 2:38:14.960]  evan veera and others stood up and said we need to remember the militia
[2:38:14.960 --> 2:38:17.920]  every able-bodied man the second amendment is enshrined
[2:38:17.920 --> 2:38:21.840]  that all men like in switzerland and other countries are there to defend and
[2:38:21.840 --> 2:38:24.480]  it's our sacred right in our duty to own firearms
[2:38:24.480 --> 2:38:28.640]  and they called for the real citizens militia to defend against tyranny
[2:38:28.640 --> 2:38:32.640]  that's why the feds then created the false militia infiltrated it
[2:38:32.640 --> 2:38:36.400]  with people said hey let's hide behind the shed let's dress in camo let's build
[2:38:36.400 --> 2:38:39.520]  pipe bombs it was always federally led creating a fake
[2:38:39.520 --> 2:38:43.840]  viper militia out of a motorcycle team they created the fake militia
[2:38:43.840 --> 2:38:46.960]  so the media could then demonize it and attack it in the atl and southern
[2:38:46.960 --> 2:38:50.880]  probably law center got caught running these groups mainstream news
[2:38:50.880 --> 2:38:54.320]  has reported on that elehim city so you know that's the groups we're talking
[2:38:54.320 --> 2:38:57.760]  about the real militia versus the counterfeit militia like we're the real
[2:38:57.760 --> 2:39:00.080]  patriot movement and you've got glenn beck
[2:39:00.080 --> 2:39:03.760]  who's definitely an operative uh... there uh... who tries to get your
[2:39:03.760 --> 2:39:07.360]  your who tries to get your confidence and then stabs you in the back as we
[2:39:07.360 --> 2:39:09.760]  predicted so so i just want to point out
[2:39:09.760 --> 2:39:14.000]  that this is people in the military in the police saying we'll just keep
[2:39:14.000 --> 2:39:17.920]  our oath this is the key to not having a confrontation
[2:39:17.920 --> 2:39:21.200]  between the military and police and the people because if they're told to carry
[2:39:21.200 --> 2:39:24.960]  out unconstitutional orders they won't and then that won't bring in
[2:39:24.960 --> 2:39:28.720]  the ensuing hysteria and and and and warfare
[2:39:28.720 --> 2:39:32.160]  that the establishment wants that's right
[2:39:32.160 --> 2:39:35.520]  and uh... and what they want to also mention is that sheriff Richard mack is
[2:39:35.520 --> 2:39:38.160]  going to be there he invited him to come speak
[2:39:38.160 --> 2:39:41.760]  and we've been we've tried to get message to jack mclam but uh... but
[2:39:41.760 --> 2:39:44.880]  definitely sheriff mack is going to be there he has a new book out on on the
[2:39:44.880 --> 2:39:47.600]  power of the sheriff the responsibility of the sheriff
[2:39:47.600 --> 2:39:50.720]  uh... to be a barrier between the federal government and the people
[2:39:50.720 --> 2:39:55.200]  abomas had him on that monday night he and and certainly whether the audience
[2:39:55.200 --> 2:39:57.840]  is aware of that book he's got on that certainly true
[2:39:57.840 --> 2:40:00.800]  kicking the feds out and and getting a little control again
[2:40:00.800 --> 2:40:04.400]  uh... how many people have contacted you overall the side i know it's getting a
[2:40:04.400 --> 2:40:07.440]  lot of traffic well several hundred thousand uh...
[2:40:07.440 --> 2:40:11.840]  hits and and just floods and floods of emails thousands of emails
[2:40:11.840 --> 2:40:14.960]  and i think that we've got a quite quite a response of people with their their
[2:40:14.960 --> 2:40:17.520]  head in lexington it's pretty short notice we know
[2:40:17.520 --> 2:40:21.040]  but it's pretty amazing how fast response has been and also i've been
[2:40:21.040 --> 2:40:24.000]  invited to speak at a uh... at a tea party rally
[2:40:24.000 --> 2:40:27.040]  in noxville tennessee on the fifteenth i might fly out there
[2:40:27.040 --> 2:40:30.800]  and just kind of do an impromptu uh... guest
[2:40:30.800 --> 2:40:34.080]  you know guest speech for them and so what they want to do they want to they
[2:40:34.080 --> 2:40:37.520]  want to they want to make it so that every protest from now on
[2:40:37.520 --> 2:40:42.240]  has an oath ceremony that that men who have taken the oath in the past veterans
[2:40:42.240 --> 2:40:46.080]  or curtsy military law enforcement can step up and reaffirm their oath and
[2:40:46.080 --> 2:40:49.280]  those who never have taken an oath to defend the constitution can do so
[2:40:49.280 --> 2:40:52.080]  and that would be pretty amazing how thousands of people stand there with
[2:40:52.080 --> 2:40:55.360]  their hands raised and the valing to defend the constitution i think it's
[2:40:55.360 --> 2:41:00.880]  really really great idea absolutely this is completely beautiful what's
[2:41:00.880 --> 2:41:04.400]  happening instead of the a d l the southern property law center
[2:41:04.400 --> 2:41:07.360]  saying patriots and constitutionalists want to kill you
[2:41:07.360 --> 2:41:11.280]  they're dangerous uh... the founding fathers are bad
[2:41:11.280 --> 2:41:15.440]  we've got to confiscate the guns we're saying no stand with the people the
[2:41:15.440 --> 2:41:19.120]  bill rights the constitution because if you let the bankers who are openly
[2:41:19.120 --> 2:41:20.480]  taking the country over
[2:41:20.480 --> 2:41:23.440]  use you against the people like the arm of a world bank doing third world
[2:41:23.440 --> 2:41:25.120]  countries is public plan
[2:41:25.120 --> 2:41:29.440]  this is going to get really nasty we're trying to short circuit
[2:41:29.440 --> 2:41:33.440]  the corporate controlled system trying to cause riots i'm sure you've noticed
[2:41:33.440 --> 2:41:36.880]  uh... that they're all over the media trying to hype rioting and civil
[2:41:36.880 --> 2:41:40.880]  insurrection so they can then blame it on us this is a central
[2:41:40.880 --> 2:41:43.360]  to stop this clash from happening
[2:41:43.360 --> 2:41:47.600]  that's right absolutely that if uh... the military and the police
[2:41:47.600 --> 2:41:50.400]  uh... realize their true duty to the people
[2:41:50.400 --> 2:41:53.040]  and to their growth of the constitution
[2:41:53.040 --> 2:41:56.400]  then it just can't happen it came over its checkmate for them
[2:41:56.400 --> 2:41:59.920]  so they can't they cannot do it without the military police and that's that's
[2:41:59.920 --> 2:42:03.520]  our mission is to try the globalist have to have enforcers there's only a few
[2:42:03.520 --> 2:42:06.720]  thousand of them and that's why they love the tragic murder of those three
[2:42:06.720 --> 2:42:09.840]  police officers by a white supremacist and it turns out the white
[2:42:09.840 --> 2:42:12.800]  supremacist was attacking me on websites
[2:42:12.800 --> 2:42:15.920]  but the southern property law center didn't care they went and found those
[2:42:15.920 --> 2:42:17.440]  comments and tried to claim
[2:42:17.440 --> 2:42:21.120]  uh... you know tie it to uh... the patriot movement ron paul myself and
[2:42:21.120 --> 2:42:24.400]  everybody else and now they've had to retract but but again that shows they're
[2:42:24.400 --> 2:42:25.920]  scared of us
[2:42:25.920 --> 2:42:29.360]  uh... that they're resorting to tactics like that because they don't want
[2:42:29.360 --> 2:42:33.120]  the police and military joining us try without that was really close right
[2:42:33.120 --> 2:42:35.920]  that that that uh... first to the spirit campaign is there right
[2:42:35.920 --> 2:42:40.000]  yeah they've had to now retract so is raw story so is the pittsburgh post-cazette
[2:42:40.000 --> 2:42:45.040]  but the new york times is refusing and now uh... alternate and also george
[2:42:45.040 --> 2:42:47.520]  soros's website is attacking us
[2:42:47.520 --> 2:42:51.680]  uh... that's media matters you know one of the daily coast writers
[2:42:51.680 --> 2:42:54.640]  in another comment thread on their site
[2:42:54.640 --> 2:42:58.000]  uh... was was was talking about if you use these gun owners if they if they
[2:42:58.000 --> 2:43:00.960]  think they're going to be able to defeat the u.s. you know in the u.s.
[2:43:00.960 --> 2:43:03.520]  government we've got news for them we're gonna we're gonna
[2:43:03.520 --> 2:43:07.360]  they actually talked about uh... and bragged about being able to call an air
[2:43:07.360 --> 2:43:10.960]  strikes and use artillery fire and flatten their homes and kill all kill
[2:43:10.960 --> 2:43:13.600]  their wives and children they love one of the regular writers
[2:43:13.600 --> 2:43:16.480]  and so that's what you know this we're from for me that we're on the right
[2:43:16.480 --> 2:43:20.720]  track our mission is that it's denied is this is this enemy of the republic
[2:43:20.720 --> 2:43:22.480]  i'm gonna do a story on

[2:43:35.360 --> 2:43:38.000]  and uh... headline google i want to show that uh...
[2:43:38.000 --> 2:43:40.480]  german government says u.s. government funded
[2:43:40.480 --> 2:43:43.600]  poll pot well we already know that was brzezinski bragged they unearthed
[2:43:43.600 --> 2:43:44.720]  documents in europe

[2:43:47.440 --> 2:43:48.000]  of it
[2:43:48.000 --> 2:43:52.080]  uh... but the issue is these are sickos man they like what stall and they like

[2:44:05.920 --> 2:44:08.640]  the more they really talk like that the more angry we get
[2:44:08.640 --> 2:44:12.400]  and the more resolved we are to make sure that they have nothing
[2:44:12.400 --> 2:44:16.320]  they have no power over us and so that's our that's our that's our job is to
[2:44:16.320 --> 2:44:20.240]  not buy into their propaganda and their assumption that they've got so you've
[2:44:20.240 --> 2:44:24.800]  got this you've got this this phony leftist quote pacifist

[2:46:02.560 --> 2:46:06.800]  shell women and children it's an article about it was an
[2:46:06.800 --> 2:46:10.640]  article uh let's see it's called a letter from a militia man with
[2:46:10.640 --> 2:46:15.200]  poll which was posted by jc wilmore and what he had
[2:46:15.200 --> 2:46:19.280]  done is um uh that a gentleman named
[2:46:19.280 --> 2:46:22.720]  michael bannerberg who was involved in the wish to go back in the 80s
[2:46:22.720 --> 2:46:26.400]  had written written him a response to something he had posted about
[2:46:26.400 --> 2:46:30.560]  about claiming that the GOP was was responsible for
[2:46:30.560 --> 2:46:34.320]  um for militias and was with citing violence and things like that
[2:46:34.320 --> 2:46:36.880]  and so he wrote him a letter saying look the GOP
[2:46:36.880 --> 2:46:40.320]  as far as we're concerned is is a morally bankrupt and
[2:46:40.320 --> 2:46:43.680]  and is an empty shell your real problem is with the people of the
[2:46:43.680 --> 2:46:48.720]  of united states this uh this uh vandal boat wrote and so this guy posted
[2:46:48.720 --> 2:46:52.320]  his letter on daily coast saying look at this wacko militia guy
[2:46:52.320 --> 2:46:55.680]  this wrote me and then started talking about you know how we're gonna stop
[2:46:55.680 --> 2:46:58.960]  these people what we're gonna do to the gun owners that's that's that's the
[2:46:58.960 --> 2:47:03.040]  discussion thread of the state this guy i want to report on this outrageous
[2:47:03.040 --> 2:47:06.640]  now here's the deal we've confirmed that one of the
[2:47:06.640 --> 2:47:10.080]  big shows on air america on in major cities
[2:47:10.080 --> 2:47:13.440]  is saying i'm calling for violence and that i told the shooter
[2:47:13.440 --> 2:47:16.880]  to kill the cops when it turns out the white supremacist was attacking me
[2:47:16.880 --> 2:47:19.840]  now that's incredible libel slander defamation
[2:47:19.840 --> 2:47:23.520]  awesome okay now now now that's going on
[2:47:23.520 --> 2:47:26.960]  we're here explaining the globalists have to have a breakdown
[2:47:26.960 --> 2:47:31.360]  of society and civil war to get away with the theft because they need to us to
[2:47:31.360 --> 2:47:35.520]  fall now that they've stolen the gdp in six months it's already done you can't
[2:47:35.520 --> 2:47:37.680]  fix it it's so bad folks you know we're gonna go into a
[2:47:37.680 --> 2:47:41.280]  depression it's gonna be horrible but they intend to keep piling on the tyranny
[2:47:41.280 --> 2:47:44.960]  they want to have a war they want to have a conflict
[2:47:44.960 --> 2:47:48.640]  and then they've got the nerve to say that we're behind this and we're doing
[2:47:48.640 --> 2:47:51.840]  this and and then they're bragging about how they want to use military against
[2:47:51.840 --> 2:47:55.360]  the american people my god i mean do they have
[2:47:55.360 --> 2:47:59.120]  any idea how hellish this is going to be if this starts up
[2:47:59.120 --> 2:48:02.720]  here he says he says if these gun nuts think they can take the field against
[2:48:02.720 --> 2:48:05.840]  one of the most brutal war machines in the world
[2:48:05.840 --> 2:48:09.920]  they would be disabused of that notion after the first airstrikes start coming
[2:48:09.920 --> 2:48:15.040]  in that's what he says so and he continues on talking
[2:48:15.040 --> 2:48:18.960]  about how you know uh you think any american would be willing to charge a
[2:48:18.960 --> 2:48:22.640]  military convoy under helicopter fire or calmly watch as their houses leveled
[2:48:22.640 --> 2:48:26.480]  with with their wife and children inside that's the reality of asymmetrical
[2:48:26.480 --> 2:48:30.080]  warfare against the u.s army they will rain down high explosives on you from
[2:48:30.080 --> 2:48:32.880]  distance distance while you're trying to land a lucky shot
[2:48:32.880 --> 2:48:36.240]  between interlocking armor plate you think these bitches would be really
[2:48:36.240 --> 2:48:39.360]  we were to strap explosives on themselves a random police station
[2:48:39.360 --> 2:48:42.240]  not just once but under as a rubber tactic i don't think so
[2:48:42.240 --> 2:48:46.320]  now he's calling the american people bitches see they have a total to stay
[2:48:46.320 --> 2:48:50.080]  when you listen to mpr it's like in fact i have the cover of time magazine
[2:48:50.080 --> 2:48:53.440]  bring it to me it was in here in the stack of somebody took it away it was
[2:48:53.440 --> 2:48:59.040]  it was newsweek oh here it is the end of excess why the crisis is good for
[2:48:59.040 --> 2:49:05.040]  america by kurt anderson time magazine and they're
[2:49:05.040 --> 2:49:08.400]  saying oh this will teach us to live in our means while the control freak
[2:49:08.400 --> 2:49:13.440]  parasites sit on top of us god they have no idea what they're
[2:49:13.440 --> 2:49:18.400]  bringing in they have no idea what they've done and
[2:49:18.400 --> 2:49:25.040]  oh my god they don't understand folks they don't understand the differences
[2:49:25.040 --> 2:49:29.200]  between the united states and iraq that's why the pentagon said they can't
[2:49:29.200 --> 2:49:31.280]  invade iran because they couldn't win there
[2:49:31.280 --> 2:49:34.800]  iraq was an intelligence hive of the united states since the
[2:49:34.800 --> 2:49:38.400]  seventies and so they knew how to control it
[2:49:38.400 --> 2:49:44.160]  and it was still hellish uh but but listen how they show who they are bad
[2:49:44.160 --> 2:49:47.840]  mounting the american people and i'll tell you this is sick
[2:49:47.840 --> 2:49:51.840]  this is sick that's the same guy who was in another article
[2:49:51.840 --> 2:49:56.800]  was lamenting any civilian casualties in iraq which is which is a worthy thing
[2:49:56.800 --> 2:50:01.040]  to say but then when it comes to his political enemies those he disdains
[2:50:01.040 --> 2:50:04.880]  those that he considers to be the other those he considers to be subhuman
[2:50:04.880 --> 2:50:09.040]  which is us you know if any has no no no or more whatsoever about
[2:50:09.040 --> 2:50:13.200]  bragging about how he's gonna fly yeah we're the subhuman americans that are
[2:50:13.200 --> 2:50:15.760]  pro gun and pro freedom that built the country
[2:50:15.760 --> 2:50:19.760]  we're the subhumans that that that pay his george soros paycheck

[2:50:37.920 --> 2:50:41.680]  they always say this like some wooden apparatchik in the soviet union
[2:50:41.680 --> 2:50:46.080]  we know best and so it's okay to send you to a re-education camp
[2:50:46.080 --> 2:50:49.760]  then i said well that's and i said well that's tyranny and he said no
[2:50:49.760 --> 2:50:54.240]  you don't fathom our mind you you don't understand
[2:50:54.240 --> 2:50:58.640]  and then i guess if i can't be re-educated

[2:57:09.200 --> 2:57:12.960]  trying to get the interviews and then it's all pointless well very very exciting
[2:57:12.960 --> 2:57:16.160]  and people should go to the site and read the 10 things you will not do because
[2:57:16.160 --> 2:57:18.400]  those are all the things that are being asked to be done can you believe all
[2:57:18.400 --> 2:57:22.000]  these liberal sites and i was just given more mainstream newspapers attacking me
[2:57:22.000 --> 2:57:26.080]  including the new york times are saying we're making it up that obama wants to
[2:57:26.080 --> 2:57:29.520]  restrict guns when he says oh i'm for the second amendment
[2:57:29.520 --> 2:57:31.760]  we're not going to ban this is a quote we're not going to ban all the guns
[2:57:31.760 --> 2:57:34.080]  overnight we're just going to restrict him incrementally
[2:57:34.080 --> 2:57:37.760]  incrementally and his chief of staff and attorney general are for total gun
[2:57:37.760 --> 2:57:42.160]  bans on record i mean how can they just keep lying and saying they're not for
[2:57:42.160 --> 2:57:45.760]  this as they do it but that's part of the strategy
[2:57:45.760 --> 2:57:48.880]  it's like this this uh this marcia on guy i won't read this here real quick
[2:57:48.880 --> 2:57:52.400]  he says i don't think american soldiers would hesitate to kill americans
[2:57:52.400 --> 2:57:56.400]  they're a very professional force and then he says after the demonization job
[2:57:56.400 --> 2:58:00.560]  that would be done by the media americans would be positively demanding
[2:58:00.560 --> 2:58:03.520]  airstrikes on their own cities that's what he says
[2:58:03.520 --> 2:58:07.680]  the communists are always and socialists are always real cold-blooded and
[2:58:07.680 --> 2:58:11.840]  into the macavelian mind and that and they just love getting in a power
[2:58:11.840 --> 2:58:15.360]  position and imagining what they do oh we would
[2:58:15.360 --> 2:58:19.600]  we demonize the gun owners and then we'd airstrike them and oh god i can't wait
[2:58:19.600 --> 2:58:22.960]  we're so close to getting these gun owners we're so close to bombing their
[2:58:22.960 --> 2:58:25.840]  families oh god i've got foundation money and
[2:58:25.840 --> 2:58:28.720]  soros money we're butchering america the global

[3:02:07.360 --> 3:02:09.920]  going back briefly to steward rode so i appreciate
[3:02:09.920 --> 3:02:13.120]  uh... doing what he's done he look he's taken up the mantle taken up the
[3:02:13.120 --> 3:02:16.320]  leadership energizing and having a huge effects
[3:02:16.320 --> 3:02:20.400]  tens of thousands of police military on record saying we and sitting in their
[3:02:20.400 --> 3:02:23.520]  photos or sitting in the picture of their ring they can be public or not
[3:02:23.520 --> 3:02:26.720]  public a lot of them want to be public saying we're not going along and then
[3:02:26.720 --> 3:02:30.400]  we're the mainstream we're the majority we're the constitutionalist
[3:02:30.400 --> 3:02:34.240]  that's why the feds bombed oklahoma city was to put a chilling effect on the
[3:02:34.240 --> 3:02:36.240]  patriot movement and claim we did it
[3:02:36.240 --> 3:02:39.280]  well we're not even calling this a patriot movement this is a constitutional
[3:02:39.280 --> 3:02:43.040]  movement against tyranny and you notice the operatives are going to
[3:02:43.040 --> 3:02:46.320]  say we're violent and sees on any opportunity to frame us

[3:08:16.640 --> 3:08:20.080]  i could have this next guest on for 10 hours what a political mind i want to
[3:08:20.080 --> 3:08:22.800]  have him back up on the show in a routine
[3:08:22.800 --> 3:08:28.320]  basis i apologize for moving him from monday to
[3:08:28.320 --> 3:08:32.720]  today i just had national media trying to frame me as a cop
[3:08:32.720 --> 3:08:34.880]  killer last week it was trying to frame me
[3:08:34.880 --> 3:08:37.440]  alternative media as a murderer of a talk show host
[3:08:37.440 --> 3:08:41.680]  so the attacks are really getting bad i mean it's getting
[3:08:41.680 --> 3:08:46.560]  crazy because even the national media is identifying me as the leader
[3:08:46.560 --> 3:08:50.320]  of the anti-government movement well if if anti-government means
[3:08:50.320 --> 3:08:54.320]  i'm against gun confiscation 12.8 trillion stolen in six months
[3:08:54.320 --> 3:08:58.320]  by offshore banks uh the tennessee newspapers reporting that the governor
[3:08:58.320 --> 3:09:00.800]  said no army checkpoints and they still did it
[3:09:00.800 --> 3:09:05.120]  i mean that's confirmed uh marines outrunning checkpoints around the
[3:09:05.120 --> 3:09:10.560]  country suddenly i mean we are entering the vortex
[3:09:10.560 --> 3:09:14.240]  and and then now the associated press we got a big article going up on prison
[3:09:14.240 --> 3:09:18.720]  planet dot com on this the associated press comes out
[3:09:18.720 --> 3:09:22.480]  and admits that there's kim trail spring
[3:09:22.480 --> 3:09:29.440]  going on by the government for our safety that they are spring
[3:09:29.440 --> 3:09:32.960]  obama looks at climate engineering i mean and then we found all these
[3:09:32.960 --> 3:09:35.680]  government sites where they admit it's a giant
[3:09:35.680 --> 3:09:41.040]  worldwide program where they're manipulating there's ap on your screen
[3:09:41.040 --> 3:09:44.240]  and i've always known they were spring i mean these trails didn't stay in the
[3:09:44.240 --> 3:09:48.000]  sky before 96 then we got other government documents
[3:09:48.000 --> 3:09:51.680]  and talk to whistleblowers but now they put out high school and in the college
[3:09:51.680 --> 3:09:54.720]  textbooks saying the government's spraying the sky to keep you safe
[3:09:54.720 --> 3:09:59.440]  from uv radiation and then there's thousands of government
[3:09:59.440 --> 3:10:02.800]  studies where they admit they're doing it and then we see all these and then
[3:10:02.800 --> 3:10:06.400]  the ap admits it and obama gives an interview
[3:10:06.400 --> 3:10:10.000]  and talks about i mean and i'm still going to be called a kook i mean
[3:10:10.000 --> 3:10:13.520]  they've announced every world world government run by the bankers that you
[3:10:13.520 --> 3:10:16.800]  pay taxes to that rules the entire earth with an 80
[3:10:16.800 --> 3:10:21.440]  percent tax rate run by the oecd i'd read carnegie
[3:10:21.440 --> 3:10:25.600]  ford rockefeller un oecd documents 10 years ago where they simple have an
[3:10:25.600 --> 3:10:29.760]  80 plus percent tax rate one child policies carbon taxes on everybody
[3:10:29.760 --> 3:10:33.440]  and i went on air and said here they are saying it you know here's cfr last year
[3:10:33.440 --> 3:10:36.400]  calling for world government global governance carbon taxes
[3:10:36.400 --> 3:10:40.320]  headline international institutions and global governments program
[3:10:40.320 --> 3:10:46.720]  cfr.org no liberties no freedoms total control
[3:10:46.720 --> 3:10:49.760]  and people are denying that i mean i'm being attacked right now
[3:10:49.760 --> 3:10:53.120]  they just walked in and gave me two more newspapers attacking me
[3:10:53.120 --> 3:10:56.320]  saying i'm dangerous and calling for violence when i'm calling to stop
[3:10:56.320 --> 3:11:00.080]  violence and saying i'm making up all of this stuff when it's all over the
[3:11:00.080 --> 3:11:02.320]  news
[3:11:02.400 --> 3:11:05.840]  let me tell you folks i got to chill up my spine because i know what that means
[3:11:05.840 --> 3:11:08.080]  the fact that they're bringing me out this big
[3:11:08.080 --> 3:11:11.680]  means they're planning to really try to do something to us and i just pray for
[3:11:11.680 --> 3:11:15.280]  us folks let's go to michael bagner at constitutional scholar
[3:11:15.280 --> 3:11:18.400]  to talk about all these things that are happening uh presidential candidate
[3:11:18.400 --> 3:11:24.400]  for libertarian party 2004 uh michael bagner good to have you here with us
[3:11:24.400 --> 3:11:29.120]  i'm so pleased to be here alex and i want to congratulate you the fact that
[3:11:29.120 --> 3:11:32.160]  they are making all of these attacks means that you have been
[3:11:32.160 --> 3:11:35.920]  doing a fantastic job that you really are
[3:11:35.920 --> 3:11:40.640]  a threat to the new world order i i'm envious
[3:11:40.640 --> 3:11:44.080]  well don't envy until you've been in the position michael well you've been all
[3:11:44.080 --> 3:11:46.960]  over national television and got nationally attacked when you were the
[3:11:46.960 --> 3:11:49.600]  libertarian party of uh candidate for president
[3:11:49.600 --> 3:11:52.880]  getting so much attention so you've actually been there before but no it
[3:11:52.880 --> 3:11:56.160]  starts getting a little bit spooky man when they're saying on air america i'm
[3:11:56.160 --> 3:11:58.480]  calling for killing cops when i've never said that
[3:11:58.480 --> 3:12:04.720]  i mean yummy yeah you've never said that but again they are getting nervous
[3:12:04.720 --> 3:12:07.920]  we are finally having an effect to the point where
[3:12:07.920 --> 3:12:13.360]  they in their ivory towers are getting a little bit nervous because they know
[3:12:13.360 --> 3:12:16.320]  the natives are restless and we are getting ready to take back
[3:12:16.320 --> 3:12:19.920]  our constitutional republic
[3:12:20.000 --> 3:12:24.640]  well that's right uh we're lawfully doing this this is a criminal government
[3:12:24.640 --> 3:12:26.960]  and what does the declaration independence say about a criminal
[3:12:26.960 --> 3:12:31.360]  government we can alter or abolish it and we
[3:12:31.360 --> 3:12:35.600]  we've created it we have individual rights and they have privileges that we
[3:12:35.600 --> 3:12:39.440]  grant them by way of article one section eight of the constitution
[3:12:39.440 --> 3:12:43.440]  and now they've got it backwards they tell us they grant us privileges
[3:12:43.440 --> 3:12:48.240]  and that they have rights but it's it that's asked backwards in it
[3:12:48.240 --> 3:12:54.400]  it is asked backwards and that is the focus of my constitution class my
[3:12:54.400 --> 3:12:59.280]  eight hour class chapter two rights versus privileges we the people have
[3:12:59.280 --> 3:13:04.400]  individual rights we give government privileges and it's the very first
[3:13:04.400 --> 3:13:08.960]  two words of the constitution article one section one clause one
[3:13:08.960 --> 3:13:14.800]  all legislative powers here in granted we grant them power
[3:13:14.800 --> 3:13:18.400]  we can take that power away from them whenever we're courageous enough to do
[3:13:18.400 --> 3:13:23.040]  so and in fact it's not all right to do it it's our duty
[3:13:23.040 --> 3:13:27.360]  our moral obligation absolutely if someone were
[3:13:27.360 --> 3:13:30.800]  attacking your child i mean you wouldn't stand there and go well come on
[3:13:30.800 --> 3:13:33.360]  Tommy give him you know lead with your left you know
[3:13:33.360 --> 3:13:37.120]  you jump in and protect the child that's your responsibility
[3:13:37.120 --> 3:13:40.640]  but we also have a responsibility to protect ourselves
[3:13:40.640 --> 3:13:45.360]  and it's just chilling what the government is doing these days
[3:13:45.360 --> 3:13:49.200]  uh... i'm sure that you've been talking about the
[3:13:49.200 --> 3:13:54.080]  missouri report that has ron paul supporters listed as terrorists
[3:13:54.080 --> 3:13:57.280]  oh we've been talking about it yeah we broke out of them
[3:13:57.280 --> 3:14:00.320]  yeah well there's a young man going through st louis
[3:14:00.320 --> 3:14:03.920]  and he had you know a couple thousand dollars on him and they were
[3:14:03.920 --> 3:14:07.680]  giving him a hard time this is i mean i don't know
[3:14:07.680 --> 3:14:11.600]  what could be more blatant i mean when we say
[3:14:11.600 --> 3:14:16.080]  totalitarian police state this is it
[3:14:16.080 --> 3:14:19.040]  well now they're putting in all and all over the country body scanners that
[3:14:19.040 --> 3:14:22.640]  admittedly scan your naked body and put it in a database
[3:14:22.640 --> 3:14:25.680]  and they want you to scan your children's naked bodies in a government
[3:14:25.680 --> 3:14:28.960]  database which they then can biometrically track with cameras
[3:14:28.960 --> 3:14:31.840]  because the camera then has your biometric algorithm it's like getting
[3:14:31.840 --> 3:14:36.080]  your digital thumb printer retina scan it's a body scan 360
[3:14:36.080 --> 3:14:39.760]  i mean what's next it's already insanely bad
[3:14:39.760 --> 3:14:43.600]  now they admit oh yeah we've been taking all babies blood at birth for a un
[3:14:43.600 --> 3:14:47.200]  database for 36 years you know i got laughed at about that now it's in all
[3:14:47.200 --> 3:14:50.480]  the newspapers they're now announcing their kim trailing us
[3:14:50.480 --> 3:14:53.760]  michael they go yeah we're spraying you for your own good
[3:14:53.760 --> 3:14:58.080]  we mix it with the jet fuel i mean that's in the associated press michael
[3:14:58.080 --> 3:15:03.040]  today i mean what i mean i've i've been trying to bring
[3:15:03.040 --> 3:15:06.960]  people's attention to it and my expertise is
[3:15:06.960 --> 3:15:12.000]  teaching people what they already know and when i teach my constitution class
[3:15:12.000 --> 3:15:17.200]  people walk out of their realizing just how far away we have gotten from the
[3:15:17.200 --> 3:15:21.440]  principles our founding fathers left us
[3:15:21.440 --> 3:15:25.200]  that's what i wake up to every day and freak out how crazy it is the fact that
[3:15:25.200 --> 3:15:28.480]  they'll admit they're setting up world government with a world currency that
[3:15:28.480 --> 3:15:33.440]  they're spraying us in a secret program that they're putting i mean
[3:15:33.440 --> 3:15:38.800]  i mean what what on earth does it take to get folks angry
[3:15:38.800 --> 3:15:42.880]  i had a gentleman call me about three weeks ago said michael
[3:15:42.880 --> 3:15:46.880]  the america's in trouble and i said yeah and he says no we got to do something
[3:15:46.880 --> 3:15:50.400]  we got to do something now and and i was glad to have him
[3:15:50.400 --> 3:15:53.520]  you know on our side but i told him that he was not going to be leading the
[3:15:53.520 --> 3:15:57.200]  parade that you know that ship had already left the dock
[3:15:57.200 --> 3:16:01.440]  so i told him which websites to look at but
[3:16:01.440 --> 3:16:08.160]  it is it is finally so ridiculously crazy that your average person
[3:16:08.160 --> 3:16:13.680]  is realizes that the government's out of control all of this
[3:16:13.680 --> 3:16:19.280]  the bailout and this stimulus package all this information
[3:16:19.280 --> 3:16:23.840]  um i just brought a cab back from the airport a couple days ago
[3:16:23.840 --> 3:16:28.720]  and i asked the cab driver how much of barack obama stimulus package he was
[3:16:28.720 --> 3:16:31.920]  going to get and he turned around and looked at me i thought for a moment he
[3:16:31.920 --> 3:16:34.960]  was going to throw me out of the cab
[3:16:36.080 --> 3:16:39.600]  so he was definitely angry at lord obama we're already seeing a lot of real
[3:16:39.600 --> 3:16:44.240]  liberals you know who aren't foundation paid off by a soros or the others
[3:16:44.240 --> 3:16:48.080]  obama publicly is funding acorns saying they're going to disrupt tea parties
[3:16:48.080 --> 3:16:51.360]  nationwide i mean we're people are going to protest against
[3:16:51.360 --> 3:16:55.680]  higher taxes and obama is going to dispatch his paid for group
[3:16:55.680 --> 3:16:59.360]  that he just gave a couple billion to out to disrupt it i mean this is getting
[3:16:59.360 --> 3:17:03.040]  insane well that's exactly what joseph
[3:17:03.040 --> 3:17:07.840]  stallin did you're not allowed to oppose the company line
[3:17:07.840 --> 3:17:12.080]  the government says something it must be true and anybody who disagrees
[3:17:12.080 --> 3:17:17.440]  is suspect of being you know a terrorist and that
[3:17:17.440 --> 3:17:21.200]  yeah i wish i could say that was only a euphemism here in the united states but
[3:17:21.200 --> 3:17:25.680]  that's getting to be literal and i'm with you
[3:17:25.680 --> 3:17:30.880]  if this if being the enemy of the state means that you're opposed to the taxes
[3:17:30.880 --> 3:17:34.560]  opposed to the unconstitutional government and opposed to all of this
[3:17:34.560 --> 3:17:39.920]  police state well i'm happy to mark shoulder to shoulder with you
[3:17:39.920 --> 3:17:43.200]  exactly at this point we're going please stop just like the founders in for a
[3:17:43.200 --> 3:17:46.960]  decade please stop please stop please and we're going this
[3:17:46.960 --> 3:17:51.360]  isn't going to go nice for you or us this is going to be mutually destructive
[3:17:51.360 --> 3:17:54.960]  you need to stop you need to and the government just gets crazier and crazier
[3:17:54.960 --> 3:17:58.400]  they're all isolated in their ivory towers let me tell you it's not isolated
[3:17:58.400 --> 3:18:02.000]  it's all their enforcers and we're now reaching out to their enforcers and
[3:18:02.000 --> 3:18:06.080]  their enforcers are reaching out to us going yeah we don't like this either
[3:18:06.080 --> 3:18:09.040]  because they're not all bad and they're made up of the general public and i
[3:18:09.040 --> 3:18:12.800]  don't michael i gotta tell you and i'll tell it like it is i've really
[3:18:12.800 --> 3:18:16.240]  looked at this through a historical lens i think the new world order is going to
[3:18:16.240 --> 3:18:18.000]  fall i don't think it's going to make it
[3:18:18.000 --> 3:18:21.280]  our biggest problem once you speak to that is that the phony christian
[3:18:21.280 --> 3:18:24.240]  churches have been paid off by the world council of churches
[3:18:24.240 --> 3:18:26.880]  to tell their flocks it's the end of the world to lay down
[3:18:26.880 --> 3:18:31.040]  so fake christian dogma telling folks it's the end of the world is the only
[3:18:31.040 --> 3:18:34.160]  thing keeping us from meeting them because because then that takes your
[3:18:34.160 --> 3:18:39.440]  mainline conservative base and they just sit there on their thumbs
[3:18:39.440 --> 3:18:42.960]  well it is the new world order is going to fall
[3:18:42.960 --> 3:18:46.960]  that that's for sure just like the sun comes up every morning just like you
[3:18:46.960 --> 3:18:50.880]  know young people discover love we're going to restore our constitutional
[3:18:50.880 --> 3:18:55.040]  republic it's definitely going to get messy between now and then
[3:18:55.040 --> 3:18:59.600]  because we've been asking them to stop the government is going to use force
[3:18:59.600 --> 3:19:03.520]  and thomas jefferson said the tree of liberty must be refreshed
[3:19:03.520 --> 3:19:07.440]  with the blood of patriots and tyrants and i'm convinced
[3:19:07.440 --> 3:19:11.520]  that thomas jefferson put patriots first because we won't pull the trigger
[3:19:11.520 --> 3:19:14.800]  first the government will pull the trigger they will kill us
[3:19:14.800 --> 3:19:18.640]  there's going to be another event possibly like wake or something like
[3:19:18.640 --> 3:19:22.080]  that and the american public is going to retaliate
[3:19:22.080 --> 3:19:25.760]  and and like you i am doing everything i can to stop
[3:19:25.760 --> 3:19:29.280]  bloodshed to stop violence and i tell people that
[3:19:29.280 --> 3:19:32.800]  the revolution will happen the only variable
[3:19:32.800 --> 3:19:36.800]  is how many people are on our side if we can get the people to wake up
[3:19:36.800 --> 3:19:42.720]  we can do a peaceful bloodless revolution except the globalist will stage
[3:19:42.720 --> 3:19:46.640]  terror attacks and blame them on us but we've already exposed false flag
[3:19:46.640 --> 3:19:49.120]  terror so that tool doesn't work anymore let's talk
[3:19:49.120 --> 3:19:51.280]  about that let's talk about strategy with michael back nearing
[3:19:51.280 --> 3:19:54.800]  got more kim trail news coming up i don't i won't have time to debunk

[3:26:59.440 --> 3:27:03.680]  but that's been posted all over the internet probably 30 or 40 different
[3:27:03.680 --> 3:27:07.520]  sites by now yeah millions of years yeah i have

[3:27:30.240 --> 3:27:32.960]  all the time that's a form of false flags where you do something bad
[3:27:32.960 --> 3:27:36.480]  for those who don't know and blame it on your political enemies
[3:27:36.480 --> 3:27:38.720]  clearly i've been i want to see if you disagree or agree
[3:27:38.720 --> 3:27:43.600]  obama is his agenda is dying the hype is wearing off even
[3:27:43.600 --> 3:27:47.440]  quicker than we had hoped but then that goes into phase two they're gonna stage
[3:27:47.440 --> 3:27:50.800]  terror maybe even a big war rand corporation says they want that
[3:27:50.800 --> 3:27:54.080]  israel saying they may hit iran they may release bird flu
[3:27:54.080 --> 3:27:56.720]  we've confirmed with government documents they are building mass graves
[3:27:56.720 --> 3:28:01.440]  everywhere the story is confirmed they've got to have a mass crisis to get
[3:28:01.440 --> 3:28:05.520]  this going it could be start rioting or kill a bunch of cops and say we did it
[3:28:05.520 --> 3:28:09.600]  that's an operation north woods what do you see happening because they're not
[3:28:09.600 --> 3:28:15.280]  going to get their agenda through without staging some big events
[3:28:15.280 --> 3:28:20.880]  you know they've got so many options i really don't know what they are
[3:28:20.880 --> 3:28:26.240]  planning to do i any of those things make me suspicious
[3:28:26.240 --> 3:28:31.360]  um you know any any large disaster you know i'm automatically trying to
[3:28:31.360 --> 3:28:35.520]  imagine if that would be you know an act of god or an act of an insane
[3:28:35.520 --> 3:28:38.640]  government but you're absolutely correct they're
[3:28:38.640 --> 3:28:43.200]  going to well the economy is already crashing we're
[3:28:43.200 --> 3:28:46.800]  kind of in the middle of that food is going to become scarce people are
[3:28:46.800 --> 3:28:50.000]  going to be you know run through the neighborhood looking for their
[3:28:50.000 --> 3:28:53.520]  neighbors last jar of peanut butter and and we are going to have
[3:28:53.520 --> 3:28:57.280]  what they gently call civil unrest well that's
[3:28:57.280 --> 3:29:02.240]  rioting in the street and that's all the excuse they're going to need to bring
[3:29:02.240 --> 3:29:06.880]  in their their troops all of the state or all
[3:29:06.880 --> 3:29:11.040]  the local police have been militarized for their SWAT
[3:29:11.040 --> 3:29:15.200]  teams and all their special equipment so i mean i don't know where it's going
[3:29:15.200 --> 3:29:19.840]  to happen i just it's i just know that it's
[3:29:19.840 --> 3:29:25.120]  probably going to and i've got all the people that listen to me ready for it
[3:29:25.120 --> 3:29:30.720]  we were storing food we've converted our uh paper money to silver and gold
[3:29:30.720 --> 3:29:35.840]  and i went to walmart personally looking for ammunition
[3:29:35.840 --> 3:29:40.080]  and the woman told me that they get a shipment every three or four days
[3:29:40.080 --> 3:29:46.080]  they don't put it on the shelf they put it on a cart and it's gone in two hours
[3:29:47.760 --> 3:29:51.840]  oh boy folks people deep down know what's coming
[3:29:51.840 --> 3:29:55.680]  we're on the march the empire's on the run
[3:29:55.680 --> 3:30:01.760]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[3:30:01.760 --> 3:30:05.520]  hello this is steve shank alex has told you you have to get a supply of food
[3:30:05.520 --> 3:30:08.960]  but alex and i've decided that there are some of you that we really don't want
[3:30:08.960 --> 3:30:12.560]  to have food if you're a politician who voted for the bailout don't call
[3:30:12.560 --> 3:30:16.560]  e-foods direct if you agree with one guy screaming about global warming

[3:37:03.680 --> 3:37:07.600]  continuing with what you were going over this is all coming to a head i mean
[3:37:07.600 --> 3:37:11.360]  this is it this is the time in history and and they've openly announced world
[3:37:11.360 --> 3:37:15.040]  government how ridiculous is it though what do you call this double
[3:37:15.040 --> 3:37:17.760]  think or double speak where they announce there's a world government a
[3:37:17.760 --> 3:37:20.720]  world currency run by banks exactly what we said it would be
[3:37:20.720 --> 3:37:24.080]  but that it doesn't exist at the same time when we criticize it
[3:37:24.080 --> 3:37:28.720]  and we're crazy well that i think uh
[3:37:28.720 --> 3:37:32.720]  um in 1984 they called it double speak
[3:37:32.720 --> 3:37:36.640]  you know war is peace you know weakness is strength
[3:37:36.640 --> 3:37:39.920]  so this is it's absolutely insane i never thought
[3:37:39.920 --> 3:37:43.280]  when i was reading that book in high school that we would come this
[3:37:43.280 --> 3:37:47.600]  close to it but i never thought that we'd have a
[3:37:47.600 --> 3:37:52.960]  patriot act the military commissions act the homegrown terrorism act if you
[3:37:52.960 --> 3:37:56.880]  told me 10 years ago alex that those documents would exist
[3:37:56.880 --> 3:38:00.400]  i'd disagree with you you know alex you're a great guy but now the american
[3:38:00.400 --> 3:38:03.520]  people would never let it get that bad well
[3:38:03.520 --> 3:38:09.520]  we have and people are finally finally starting to realize just how
[3:38:09.520 --> 3:38:14.160]  far out of control it is problem is that they've waited so long
[3:38:14.160 --> 3:38:16.880]  now they're starting to feel like it's hopeless
[3:38:16.880 --> 3:38:20.000]  but that is not true we are having an effect
[3:38:20.000 --> 3:38:24.640]  your your presence uh in the radio and in your videos
[3:38:24.640 --> 3:38:28.400]  has had a tremendous effect um my mother
[3:38:28.400 --> 3:38:32.480]  has uh watched your videos and passed them out to friends of hers
[3:38:32.480 --> 3:38:38.560]  oh good so yeah i mean we really are having a huge movement right now people
[3:38:38.560 --> 3:38:42.160]  are um you know coming over you know to
[3:38:42.160 --> 3:38:45.760]  realize that um you know the government has been
[3:38:45.760 --> 3:38:49.600]  lying to us spending us into uh into oblivion
[3:38:49.600 --> 3:38:53.200]  and you know we those of us who have been here we just got to give the new
[3:38:53.200 --> 3:38:56.080]  people a little bit of time to to get their balance
[3:38:56.080 --> 3:39:00.240]  because we we have taken a long time to learn this it's kind of
[3:39:00.240 --> 3:39:05.440]  obvious to us but for these new people it is such a shock to their system to
[3:39:05.440 --> 3:39:08.960]  realize just how far the deception has gone
[3:39:08.960 --> 3:39:12.720]  well think of the magnitude that we've known hey
[3:39:12.720 --> 3:39:16.080]  those aren't ice crystal trails they're staying there for hours they're turning
[3:39:16.080 --> 3:39:20.000]  into clouds they're what is that plane is it spraying it but that one right by
[3:39:20.000 --> 3:39:23.200]  it is and now the president just goes yeah we're spraying you
[3:39:23.200 --> 3:39:27.760]  for your own good it's classified yeah it's classified
[3:39:27.760 --> 3:39:31.520]  you know and for our own good i i wouldn't trust them as far as i can
[3:39:31.520 --> 3:39:34.640]  throw them we're literally living in a matrix like situation
[3:39:34.640 --> 3:39:39.120]  i mean you know we're not in tanks you know in some belly of a system but we
[3:39:39.120 --> 3:39:41.920]  might as well be our brains are so programmed
[3:39:41.920 --> 3:39:45.120]  that what you know is reality i mean i start wondering
[3:39:45.120 --> 3:39:47.840]  i start wondering what other crazy stuff may be true
[3:39:47.840 --> 3:39:51.200]  because i always know something's wrong my whole life i grew up in trails
[3:39:51.200 --> 3:39:54.000]  weren't like that and i grew up you know near an airport by
[3:39:54.000 --> 3:39:58.480]  dallas and suddenly you know but you always kind of had a nagging thing while
[3:39:58.480 --> 3:40:00.720]  the government admits some of it but maybe i'm just
[3:40:00.720 --> 3:40:03.840]  maybe i am and then the president comes on goes yeah we're spraying you
[3:40:03.840 --> 3:40:06.800]  you know you mean you want to believe i mean i might you ever want to believe
[3:40:06.800 --> 3:40:12.880]  this stuff isn't real yes because if it is real then we are
[3:40:12.880 --> 3:40:17.680]  in so much trouble and i think that's where most people get their denial
[3:40:17.680 --> 3:40:22.560]  it's like alex no way that they can have all these concentration camps no way
[3:40:22.560 --> 3:40:25.920]  they're digging graves i mean if that's true
[3:40:25.920 --> 3:40:29.440]  you know we are really in deep deep serious trouble and i might have to get
[3:40:29.440 --> 3:40:33.920]  you know turn off a wheel of fortune and start to do something about it
[3:40:33.920 --> 3:40:39.280]  but over the years i've watched people across the country
[3:40:39.280 --> 3:40:43.520]  my presidential campaign allowed me to travel to all 48 of the
[3:40:43.520 --> 3:40:50.080]  lower you know the state and and they people are all over in
[3:40:50.080 --> 3:40:54.000]  oregon and washington and california everywhere they've got groups
[3:40:54.000 --> 3:40:57.760]  who are just as passionate as you and i are they're doing good work and then
[3:40:57.760 --> 3:41:02.240]  they go we're the only ones fighting for liberty it's like are you
[3:41:02.240 --> 3:41:06.320]  crazy no no because they're all they're all they're all compartmentalized let me
[3:41:06.320 --> 3:41:09.040]  make a point and i want your take on this the barman's is gonna come in with

[3:43:07.840 --> 3:43:12.960]  mass graves and doing surveys to bury uh what 900 something bodies per acre
[3:43:12.960 --> 3:43:15.200]  where they can bury the bodies for a flu outbreak
[3:43:15.200 --> 3:43:18.800]  we put these documents on air and we've got all these other mainstream news
[3:43:18.800 --> 3:43:21.920]  stories but then the news says we're liars
[3:43:21.920 --> 3:43:27.760]  none of this exists mike well it's disinformation if they can
[3:43:27.760 --> 3:43:32.960]  contradict if the average person hears you and i talking about mass graves
[3:43:32.960 --> 3:43:36.800]  and then they read another report that says no there are no mass graves it's
[3:43:36.800 --> 3:43:41.840]  a it's a fallacy the answer they want to believe
[3:43:41.840 --> 3:43:45.200]  they want to believe that there are no mass graves and so
[3:43:45.200 --> 3:43:49.040]  you know the the person without any more information that is going to
[3:43:49.040 --> 3:43:52.560]  you know lean in the direction of all you know michael and alex they're just
[3:43:52.560 --> 3:43:55.600]  exaggerating they're on the radio they're trying to create names for
[3:43:55.600 --> 3:43:59.680]  themselves when i mean all this stuff is true
[3:43:59.680 --> 3:44:04.960]  absolutely you were reporting on black helicopters down at the gulf coast of
[3:44:04.960 --> 3:44:08.560]  texas and i happened to have a friend living there
[3:44:08.560 --> 3:44:12.320]  and i called and i said you know i just heard a report
[3:44:12.320 --> 3:44:15.520]  and she goes yeah i saw those i wondered what they were doing
[3:44:15.520 --> 3:44:19.680]  and so i had you know like secondhand confirmation somebody who'd seen those
[3:44:19.680 --> 3:44:23.280]  black helicopters down in south texas personally
[3:44:23.280 --> 3:44:26.480]  so this stuff does happen it is happening
[3:44:26.480 --> 3:44:32.960]  i mean we don't have to invent a trillion dollar bailout and let me just
[3:44:32.960 --> 3:44:36.000]  give a quick analysis for your listeners
[3:44:36.000 --> 3:44:39.920]  one inch little tiny one inch you put 12 of them together you get
[3:44:39.920 --> 3:44:43.920]  a foot you put a million of them together
[3:44:43.920 --> 3:44:50.880]  that's 15.7 miles a billion is 15,700 miles
[3:44:50.880 --> 3:44:53.520]  which is a little more than halfway around the world
[3:44:53.520 --> 3:45:00.480]  a trillion inches is 633 laps around the equator
[3:45:00.480 --> 3:45:05.040]  that's a lot of interest and barack opama is just
[3:45:05.040 --> 3:45:09.120]  casually throwing a trillion of your dollars here a trillion of your dollars
[3:45:09.120 --> 3:45:14.400]  there but even better but even better 12.8
[3:45:14.400 --> 3:45:18.400]  trillion the last six months that's 200 billion short of the gdp so 12.8
[3:45:18.400 --> 3:45:22.880]  trillion so in a year it'll be 26 trillion by that math or to be technical
[3:45:22.880 --> 3:45:28.720]  25.6 trillion 25.6 trillion in one year and
[3:45:28.720 --> 3:45:33.600]  they're saying they're expanding it that's the double the gdp of the country
[3:45:33.600 --> 3:45:37.680]  and then he has the nerve to say i'm going to balance the budget in one year
[3:45:37.680 --> 3:45:41.520]  when bush tripled the size of government in eight years
[3:45:41.520 --> 3:45:45.280]  obama is doubling that in the first year mike
[3:45:45.280 --> 3:45:48.560]  i mean this is this is just it's all over go ahead
[3:45:48.560 --> 3:45:53.600]  yeah i don't i don't think that we could physically put a 12 trillion dollars
[3:45:53.600 --> 3:45:59.040]  on an aircraft carrier i think the aircraft carrier would sink
[3:45:59.040 --> 3:46:03.840]  with 12 trillion paper dollars on it i think we have to do the calculations to
[3:46:03.840 --> 3:46:06.880]  see that but i mean just to give your listeners some
[3:46:06.880 --> 3:46:12.480]  understanding of i mean this is boggled imagination
[3:46:12.480 --> 3:46:17.120]  and as if you can call anything with 12 zeros
[3:46:17.120 --> 3:46:21.840]  left of the decimal point of budget mike this is too important can we're
[3:46:21.840 --> 3:46:25.600]  going to do overdrive today man so stand by for overdrive mike i'll have to
[3:46:25.600 --> 3:46:28.800]  call you back on your line in 15 minutes on our studio
[3:46:28.800 --> 3:46:31.840]  let's do uh let's do 20 minutes of overdrive
[3:46:31.840 --> 3:46:34.800]  so we have time to take all these calls and we're out of chance to get on air
[3:46:34.800 --> 3:46:37.360]  so get me the studio number i'm going to give that out and we're going to keep
[3:46:37.360 --> 3:46:42.720]  back naryc 20 minutes over because jason berness breaking news come on down
[3:46:42.720 --> 3:46:45.600]  and that means we're going to continue on at info wars dot com the streams and
[3:46:45.600 --> 3:46:48.720]  prison planet dot tv 20 minutes in the next hour with michael
[3:46:48.720 --> 3:46:52.640]  bagneric and the breaking kim trail news i mean this this is all off the charts
[3:46:52.640 --> 3:46:56.160]  and and and again we had government documents a year ago where they finally
[3:46:56.160 --> 3:46:58.880]  admitted yes we're manipulating the atmosphere for your own good
[3:46:58.880 --> 3:47:02.080]  but we won't save you know what we're doing but we already reversed engineer
[3:47:02.080 --> 3:47:05.360]  didn't know what they're doing at least one of the programs but i mean to have
[3:47:05.360 --> 3:47:08.400]  ap admitting this this is a day long remember
[3:47:08.400 --> 3:47:14.000]  i mean you know and and and then the attacks that are happening right now
[3:47:14.000 --> 3:47:17.280]  it gives me an actually great feeling of satisfaction because it means we are
[3:47:17.280 --> 3:47:20.080]  just i mean you don't want to admit to yourself
[3:47:20.080 --> 3:47:22.960]  that you that your operation and what you've built
[3:47:22.960 --> 3:47:27.280]  is literally part of history now and that and it's also scary
[3:47:27.280 --> 3:47:31.600]  i mean i mean because it's just getting
[3:47:31.600 --> 3:47:34.560]  you know i've always tried to not make it about me because michael you're a smart
[3:47:34.560 --> 3:47:37.360]  guy you know that that means it makes you a target
[3:47:37.360 --> 3:47:40.960]  it's also not good for the movement overall because you want to have lots of
[3:47:40.960 --> 3:47:44.320]  leaders and we do have that now but they're but they're trying to make me
[3:47:44.320 --> 3:47:47.360]  the leader so they can crush me and then think they think that'll decapitate
[3:47:47.360 --> 3:47:50.240]  things it's not going to work but it's kind of a
[3:47:50.240 --> 3:47:52.880]  i don't know i just grow up as a kid ever thought i'd be in this position
[3:47:52.880 --> 3:47:57.840]  jason you've got major breaking news major breaking news at info wars dot
[3:47:57.840 --> 3:48:00.480]  com curtain ammo has got it up on info wars
[3:48:00.480 --> 3:48:03.360]  dot com we broke the mic report and now we've got this
[3:48:03.360 --> 3:48:07.520]  yeah this is the 2009 virginia terrorism threat assessment
[3:48:07.520 --> 3:48:10.960]  uh document out of the virginia fusion centers alex you've always been talking
[3:48:10.960 --> 3:48:14.000]  about these fusion centers well this isn't a 12 page document
[3:48:14.000 --> 3:48:19.520]  uh this is 215 pages and i'm literally still printing it off as we speak
[3:48:19.520 --> 3:48:22.960]  and uh if you just look at the first couple pages of this thing
[3:48:22.960 --> 3:48:26.240]  you know they try to say oh it's an international terrorism threat and then
[3:48:26.240 --> 3:48:30.000]  the usual suspects the arabs right then it just goes into
[3:48:30.000 --> 3:48:34.640]  every other facet of life every every group is an extremist group
[3:48:34.640 --> 3:48:38.480]  they're using colleges correctional facilities the internet to
[3:48:38.480 --> 3:48:41.680]  recruit people and they're all terrorists look uh here are some of the uh
[3:48:41.680 --> 3:48:44.400]  i haven't even gotten this far because this is page uh 60
[3:48:44.400 --> 3:48:48.160]  lone wolf extremists militia extremists
[3:48:48.160 --> 3:48:52.480]  uh special interest extremism now if you're part of a special interest group
[3:48:52.480 --> 3:48:55.200]  you're also a terrorist well they have state police under homeland security
[3:48:55.200 --> 3:48:59.200]  federalization spying on bike rights groups that want bike lanes
[3:48:59.200 --> 3:49:03.600]  spying on groups that don't want landfills as terrorists and they list
[3:49:03.600 --> 3:49:07.360]  this is in the news so uh we're gonna continue after the break with this
[3:49:07.360 --> 3:49:09.760]  um and we're going to overdrive michael bagnaric
[3:49:09.760 --> 3:49:13.520]  this is desperation they're trying to demonize and create a chilling effect
[3:49:13.520 --> 3:49:16.640]  because they know we are waking the people up and that
[3:49:16.640 --> 3:49:20.640]  freedom is becoming the majority paradigm
[3:49:21.360 --> 3:49:26.000]  correct michael absolutely i agree and i will hang with you as long as you're
[3:49:26.000 --> 3:49:29.680]  willing to keep me on the air i'm i'm here okay give us your take though on
[3:49:29.680 --> 3:49:33.040]  the fact that they're trying to demonize patriots with these mayak type reports
[3:49:33.040 --> 3:49:37.920]  and now this virginia fusion center report well of course i mean that's what
[3:49:37.920 --> 3:49:42.000]  adolf hitler did to demonize the jews he started with
[3:49:42.000 --> 3:49:45.680]  newspaper articles anything bad that happened that had to be
[3:49:45.680 --> 3:49:49.280]  caused by the jews not what it wasn't true but
[3:49:49.280 --> 3:49:52.800]  if you say it you get people thinking in that direction
[3:49:52.800 --> 3:49:58.480]  and and then they move you you uh will your website is info wars dot com
[3:49:58.480 --> 3:50:02.960]  i teach in my class that we are in in an ideological war
[3:50:02.960 --> 3:50:08.720]  a war of ideas and it's a war of individual rights versus this collectivist
[3:50:08.720 --> 3:50:12.240]  activity and the other team is winning because we're not
[3:50:12.240 --> 3:50:16.960]  we're not sure how they're fighting the war they change definitions
[3:50:16.960 --> 3:50:21.120]  they they just keep promoting the same lies over and over again
[3:50:21.120 --> 3:50:24.880]  and i don't remember who it was but they said if you know you tell a lie
[3:50:24.880 --> 3:50:28.720]  often enough you don't see what i believe it it was headler
[3:50:28.720 --> 3:50:33.120]  you know so that's exactly what they're doing
[3:50:33.120 --> 3:50:38.480]  and i'm i'm rather proud i had the uh anti defamation league include me on a
[3:50:38.480 --> 3:50:42.240]  list of right-wing extremists and racists because i

[4:09:00.240 --> 4:09:03.440]  and like they stood up for the ron paul campaign
[4:09:03.440 --> 4:09:05.440]  they're standing up for these uh...
[4:09:05.440 --> 4:09:09.160]  tea parties apparently this was started by one blogger

[4:09:19.800 --> 4:09:22.380]  revolution against tyranny begins
[4:09:22.380 --> 4:09:24.400]  is that
[4:09:24.400 --> 4:09:27.600]  those that don't understand people can see all ron paul didn't win all that
[4:09:27.600 --> 4:09:31.120]  money all that was a lost know it educated people about the bankers
[4:09:31.120 --> 4:09:34.880]  about the inflation tax about the new world order about the globalist
[4:09:34.880 --> 4:09:38.040]  it's now the number one thing not communism or fascism you know not
[4:09:38.040 --> 4:09:39.720]  liberalism or conservatism
[4:09:39.720 --> 4:09:41.320]  on the campuses
[4:09:41.320 --> 4:09:44.960]  uh... and and and out of that now is spinning off

[4:09:48.520 --> 4:09:49.440]  builds
[4:09:49.440 --> 4:09:51.680]  and bills and it's it's organic
[4:09:51.680 --> 4:09:53.400]  and it's decentralized
[4:09:53.400 --> 4:09:57.160]  and it can't be stopped and it's just growing and now nexus pointing
[4:09:57.160 --> 4:10:00.120]  and and and and they're all interconnecting and it's just powering up
[4:10:00.120 --> 4:10:05.120]  like a like a huge warehouse of dynamos is
[4:10:05.120 --> 4:10:08.000]  inches and and and and the new ones are spending off

[4:11:29.080 --> 4:11:32.440]  like the killing fields uh... that the globalist
[4:11:32.440 --> 4:11:33.920]  and brzezinski funded

[4:14:55.600 --> 4:14:59.680]  how off the charts for any political purpose and this is law enforcement
[4:14:59.680 --> 4:15:02.960]  sensitive just like the myack report this is a month because they want to do
[4:15:02.960 --> 4:15:05.680]  this lying and cheating and and and slandering
[4:15:05.680 --> 4:15:06.800]  and defaming

[4:15:13.440 --> 4:15:18.200]  the uh... cyberterrorism and then you continue sir um... here right here
[4:15:18.200 --> 4:15:23.280]  is the alone wolf extremists now if uh... you are included in social
[4:15:23.280 --> 4:15:26.600]  political or religious car and i read that it says you have a good
[4:15:26.600 --> 4:15:29.680]  i've seen it before some other about other feds putting out
[4:15:29.680 --> 4:15:33.720]  it blocking your desk not talking being prosecuted in the terrorist yet i mean
[4:15:33.720 --> 4:15:34.800]  it's on
[4:15:34.800 --> 4:15:38.160]  bob say walking your death leaveable uh... it i'm not sure if that's in here
[4:15:38.160 --> 4:15:41.840]  here they always also say mainline groups that have soup kitchens
[4:15:41.840 --> 4:15:45.080]  and one and say sheriffs have authority they say that's terrorism yet they're
[4:15:45.080 --> 4:15:48.200]  going they're going hardcore after anti-abortion groups i mean they're
[4:15:48.200 --> 4:15:49.760]  listing colleges
[4:15:49.760 --> 4:15:53.920]  uh... like james madison university as a plot possible place to harbin uh...
[4:15:53.920 --> 4:15:55.080]  harbor terrorism
[4:15:55.080 --> 4:15:58.320]  uh... what's another uh... university college william and mary so now
[4:15:58.320 --> 4:16:01.120]  if you're a christian and you don't believe in abortion
[4:16:01.120 --> 4:16:05.000]  uh... if you're part of life in liberty ministries you may be a terrorist i
[4:16:05.000 --> 4:16:07.840]  mean see what's happening is now seventy plus percent of people are against
[4:16:07.840 --> 4:16:09.640]  abortion we're winning that fight to
[4:16:09.640 --> 4:16:13.160]  refining out on a blob of tissue is all the vans driving around showing a baby
[4:16:13.160 --> 4:16:14.960]  in a month all being chopped up
[4:16:14.960 --> 4:16:18.320]  so see that okay i believe you know how we're all terrorists yes uh... i mean
[4:16:18.320 --> 4:16:21.000]  let's just go through it i mean if you're trying to recruit people for your
[4:16:21.000 --> 4:16:23.880]  cause you're radicalizing them therefore it's terrorism
[4:16:23.880 --> 4:16:28.000]  uh... if you were is that what section is that is uh... recruitment and
[4:16:28.000 --> 4:16:30.720]  radicalization that is section that is page one twenty five let's see if i
[4:16:30.720 --> 4:16:32.120]  don't have that in front of me
[4:16:32.120 --> 4:16:36.040]  again this is a two hundred and fifteen page document folks and i'm just
[4:16:36.040 --> 4:16:39.560]  continue continue yeah let's let's let's go to that i think i have that one what
[4:16:39.560 --> 4:16:43.840]  is that one not one time over the other as you have a little sure sure um...
[4:16:43.840 --> 4:16:44.960]  let's see uh...
[4:16:44.960 --> 4:16:48.080]  this is this is just the beginning listen you gotta do control f searches for
[4:16:48.080 --> 4:16:51.880]  like ron paul i did at the ron paul's not in there libertarians not in their
[4:16:51.880 --> 4:16:55.400]  info wars is not in there i did the control f searches so i was kind of
[4:16:55.400 --> 4:16:57.720]  just going through a second amendment
[4:16:57.720 --> 4:17:00.640]  i didn't do second amendment so i'm not quite sure i do have to do a control
[4:17:00.640 --> 4:17:04.360]  after search i mean this was really off the cuff alex i mean people who are
[4:17:04.360 --> 4:17:06.640]  starting anti-obama websites
[4:17:06.640 --> 4:17:10.720]  are apparently terrorists all yeah they have exactly that what's what pages
[4:17:10.720 --> 4:17:14.800]  that on that is page sixty uh... apparently uh... one of the militia
[4:17:14.800 --> 4:17:17.760]  groups out there uh... virginia militia groups that the group appears to have
[4:17:17.760 --> 4:17:21.320]  been started as a direct result of the founders frustration with the obama
[4:17:21.320 --> 4:17:24.920]  administration and i mean notice their spine on all these groups you know every
[4:17:24.920 --> 4:17:27.720]  single one of these they talk about how they have surveillance at the end you
[4:17:27.720 --> 4:17:30.040]  see this is going county by county
[4:17:30.040 --> 4:17:33.600]  in subsections literally saying where where these groups are
[4:17:33.600 --> 4:17:37.760]  who they are and that's the issue this is a surveillance document all my god
[4:17:37.760 --> 4:17:39.720]  this is people just like when they got caught
[4:17:39.720 --> 4:17:42.720]  nimble you do a story point out that they in virginia and in new york they've
[4:17:42.720 --> 4:17:44.080]  been caught spying on the
[4:17:44.080 --> 4:17:46.160]  bike-riding groups because you gotta go
[4:17:46.160 --> 4:17:49.040]  my michael bagnaric i mean it's bad enough to have secret police everywhere
[4:17:49.040 --> 4:17:49.480]  but
[4:17:49.480 --> 4:17:54.360]  they're spying on the anti-death penalty groups and the bike-riding groups
[4:17:54.360 --> 4:17:58.440]  well apparently don't have freedom of speech in this country anymore
[4:17:58.440 --> 4:18:01.120]  uh... during the presidential campaign
[4:18:01.120 --> 4:18:03.760]  i spoke at a uh... college
[4:18:03.760 --> 4:18:06.560]  in a unit uh... audit program
[4:18:06.560 --> 4:18:08.800]  they wouldn't move to a smaller room
[4:18:08.800 --> 4:18:11.800]  because it was a free speech zone
[4:18:11.800 --> 4:18:16.400]  and i told that audience that anywhere i happen to be standing as a free speech
[4:18:16.400 --> 4:18:17.520]  zone
[4:18:17.520 --> 4:18:18.280]  and
[4:18:18.280 --> 4:18:19.440]  that you know we
[4:18:19.440 --> 4:18:20.720]  the purpose
[4:18:20.720 --> 4:18:24.600]  when i teach my class the purpose of freedom of speech
[4:18:24.600 --> 4:18:29.280]  is freedom of political speech if we have the right to alter that is the most
[4:18:29.280 --> 4:18:31.440]  protected speech there is
[4:18:31.440 --> 4:18:34.720]  but now now now we don't even have free speech so now we just got rid of it
[4:18:34.720 --> 4:18:36.360]  turn right into a privilege
[4:18:36.360 --> 4:18:38.560]  then they sequester it then they get rid of it
[4:18:38.560 --> 4:18:41.480]  on believable by bernie's continued i want to go through some calls
[4:18:41.480 --> 4:18:45.240]  sure here's just another subsection uh... terrorist extremist group presence
[4:18:45.240 --> 4:18:48.000]  it is important to note that university-based students groups are
[4:18:48.000 --> 4:18:53.440]  recognized as a radicalization note for almost every type of extremist group
[4:18:53.440 --> 4:18:55.560]  you're in college you're an extremist
[4:18:55.560 --> 4:19:00.280]  you're a terror radicalization no yes if you go to college alexa apparently you
[4:19:00.280 --> 4:19:03.200]  might be involved in extremism we've been writing the
[4:19:03.200 --> 4:19:06.120]  we're going to set a road on the axis of terrorism
[4:19:06.120 --> 4:19:08.560]  and the texas report said blue jeans and cell phones
[4:19:08.560 --> 4:19:10.800]  let's go ahead and go some calls we're reading over that
[4:19:10.800 --> 4:19:14.600]  uh... somebody disagrees so that david florida first disagrees
[4:19:14.600 --> 4:19:17.480]  they've told me everything's wonderful i guess uh...
[4:19:17.480 --> 4:19:19.780]  well what's going on
[4:19:19.780 --> 4:19:21.200]  not taking here okay
[4:19:21.200 --> 4:19:22.800]  yes sir
[4:19:22.800 --> 4:19:27.480]  yeah uh... no alexa i'm i'm a great fan of the show and uh... i think you do
[4:19:27.480 --> 4:19:31.480]  great work and everything and i i i tried to wake people up and
[4:19:31.480 --> 4:19:34.680]  you know i recommend the websites and you and
[4:19:34.680 --> 4:19:39.360]  often have to to defend you and i i'm saying stuff and i'll say we don't
[4:19:39.360 --> 4:19:40.200]  this
[4:19:40.200 --> 4:19:44.640]  and i'll say all these crazier that whatever and
[4:19:44.640 --> 4:19:46.480]  like all day today
[4:19:46.480 --> 4:19:50.760]  you've been saying that that a p article about obama looks like climate
[4:19:50.760 --> 4:19:52.520]  engineering
[4:19:52.520 --> 4:19:56.240]  you've been saying that it says in that article
[4:19:56.240 --> 4:20:01.040]  that they're spraying chemtrails and obama said it and a p saying that in
[4:20:01.040 --> 4:20:02.920]  that article and they're not
[4:20:02.920 --> 4:20:05.760]  meaning out there they're just
[4:20:05.760 --> 4:20:09.480]  they're saying they're thinking they're saying that they're thinking about it
[4:20:09.480 --> 4:20:12.080]  and it's something that they're considering
[4:20:12.080 --> 4:20:13.560]  and you know
[4:20:13.560 --> 4:20:17.000]  we're going to look at what we have to this guy's question for a second
[4:20:17.000 --> 4:20:20.440]  election one of the stories i went over yesterday is u s to take up carbon
[4:20:20.440 --> 4:20:25.160]  mantle see they're going to lead the way into this new i don't make a lot of money
[4:20:25.160 --> 4:20:28.080]  well here's the deal even saudi arabia now you know it lindsay williams has
[4:20:28.080 --> 4:20:31.160]  said this is going to kill saudi arabia the saudi arabians are pissed
[4:20:31.160 --> 4:20:33.880]  there and they're actually coming out saying this whole thing is going to
[4:20:33.880 --> 4:20:34.700]  ruin them
[4:20:34.700 --> 4:20:37.560]  so if you're talking if it says terraforming in that article i have not
[4:20:37.560 --> 4:20:39.120]  seen it
[4:20:39.120 --> 4:20:42.040]  they've been doing this openly we're gonna have rosalind peterson on our
[4:20:42.040 --> 4:20:45.520]  both of our show is very shortly to go over the chemtrail in favor of you guys
[4:20:45.520 --> 4:20:47.260]  print me that article again
[4:20:47.260 --> 4:20:50.800]  somebody picked it up or something because it's not here in my stack uh...
[4:20:50.800 --> 4:20:54.400]  the uh... the uh... article about no it's not in that stack
[4:20:54.400 --> 4:20:56.680]  because that's yesterday's fact
[4:20:56.680 --> 4:20:58.920]  uh... if somebody had it out of here to thank you
[4:20:58.920 --> 4:21:00.880]  okay look a p
[4:21:00.880 --> 4:21:01.800]  now
[4:21:01.800 --> 4:21:04.400]  the reason i flipped out what i saw this on air
[4:21:04.400 --> 4:21:07.440]  is because i know about his science advisor
[4:21:07.440 --> 4:21:11.080]  and i know about the three articles paul watson wrote last year where they
[4:21:11.080 --> 4:21:12.160]  admitted it
[4:21:12.160 --> 4:21:15.400]  and then to have obama come out and say we're looking at it
[4:21:15.400 --> 4:21:18.640]  my whole point is they admit that they have this terraforming and they say
[4:21:18.640 --> 4:21:20.000]  they've been testing it
[4:21:20.000 --> 4:21:22.880]  so i have the complete knowledge of this
[4:21:22.880 --> 4:21:25.960]  uh... information i would say the complete but you know for what's public
[4:21:25.960 --> 4:21:27.520]  i have a complete knowledge
[4:21:27.520 --> 4:21:30.800]  of it and and and and and so have you read the other three articles
[4:21:30.800 --> 4:21:34.920]  where they admit that they're uh... all are altering the atmosphere
[4:21:34.920 --> 4:21:39.440]  yeah i'm not totally no uh... you know i don't want to listen screw your
[4:21:39.440 --> 4:21:41.000]  friends then and
[4:21:41.000 --> 4:21:44.680]  now i don't know what i'm saying it but i appreciate your call sir i'd look
[4:21:44.680 --> 4:21:48.120]  is he still there just i'm i'm so mad go ahead and finish
[4:21:48.120 --> 4:21:52.320]  but i'm just saying can you see my point that it's so can you see my point
[4:21:52.320 --> 4:21:54.340]  that it's hard that if i say
[4:21:54.340 --> 4:21:59.320]  if it's a people say people go to that article and say alex jones said it said
[4:21:59.320 --> 4:22:03.280]  in this article they're doing that and they'll go it doesn't say that and he's
[4:22:03.280 --> 4:22:04.580]  full of crap
[4:22:04.580 --> 4:22:07.280]  it's really strong strong
[4:22:07.280 --> 4:22:11.720]  and you know if this is what it comes down to all this in it picking and all
[4:22:11.720 --> 4:22:13.800]  of this bowl man
[4:22:13.800 --> 4:22:18.440]  but i don't know if i would like to have what they want that twelve point eight
[4:22:18.440 --> 4:22:20.200]  trillions already been stolen
[4:22:20.200 --> 4:22:23.920]  i get emails saying that's made up what it's in bloomberg an associated press
[4:22:23.920 --> 4:22:26.320]  okay i didn't make any of this stuff up
[4:22:26.320 --> 4:22:31.360]  that is a legal ease mind game that is being played and i'm frankly i can't
[4:22:31.360 --> 4:22:32.360]  take it anymore
[4:22:32.360 --> 4:22:34.720]  uh...
[4:22:34.720 --> 4:22:39.360]  see i'm sitting here but i don't know if i call let him go i'm done talking to
[4:22:39.360 --> 4:22:40.080]  him
[4:22:40.080 --> 4:22:43.640]  sir let me tell you something don't tell people to the show i got a plan for
[4:22:43.640 --> 4:22:44.920]  you okay
[4:22:44.920 --> 4:22:45.960]  i got a plan
[4:22:45.960 --> 4:22:50.320]  i got a plan i want you to go by please don't ever listen again i don't care
[4:22:50.320 --> 4:22:51.440]  okay
[4:22:51.440 --> 4:22:54.280]  i didn't lie about this
[4:22:54.280 --> 4:22:57.520]  what i didn't do was play their propaganda game
[4:22:57.520 --> 4:23:04.440]  yes obama is openly announcing they may need to spray the atmosphere to save us
[4:23:04.440 --> 4:23:06.600]  now i already knew a hundred
[4:23:06.600 --> 4:23:10.200]  universities and put out literally thousands of tests it's hundreds of
[4:23:10.200 --> 4:23:13.280]  universities department of energy all these other foreign
[4:23:13.280 --> 4:23:17.160]  the government departments
[4:23:17.160 --> 4:23:19.600]  his mike on you know what no no no no
[4:23:19.600 --> 4:23:23.120]  and i know back there is going to be going to take more calls but i mean
[4:23:23.120 --> 4:23:25.200]  here's the issue
[4:23:25.200 --> 4:23:28.960]  i said there i go here's the cfr calling for global government and i get
[4:23:28.960 --> 4:23:31.920]  emails going no it says they're calling for global governance
[4:23:31.920 --> 4:23:35.320]  pull up go to go to dictionary dot com
[4:23:35.320 --> 4:23:36.400]  did you did
[4:23:36.400 --> 4:23:39.920]  just type the definition of governance
[4:23:39.920 --> 4:23:42.480]  and it will say a system of government
[4:23:42.480 --> 4:23:45.240]  so global government means a system of global government
[4:23:45.240 --> 4:23:48.320]  and i get these emails saying no it says governance on government i'm not
[4:23:48.320 --> 4:23:51.400]  playing your semantical games man
[4:23:51.400 --> 4:23:52.640]  and not
[4:23:52.640 --> 4:23:55.720]  playing
[4:23:55.720 --> 4:23:57.000]  okay
[4:23:57.000 --> 4:24:00.200]  i'm not
[4:24:00.200 --> 4:24:01.880]  i am not going to sit there
[4:24:01.880 --> 4:24:05.000]  it is a definition of governance that's what the pity i want the encyclopedia on
[4:24:05.000 --> 4:24:06.920]  that similar but i want
[4:24:06.920 --> 4:24:10.720]  i am not going to play these games anymore with folks okay
[4:24:10.720 --> 4:24:14.480]  you know we have posted the articles that no one seems to want to look at these
[4:24:14.480 --> 4:24:17.600]  want to speculate all day where they admit they're doing test
[4:24:17.600 --> 4:24:23.560]  to terraform and manipulate the atmosphere
[4:24:23.560 --> 4:24:26.280]  we have done the studies
[4:24:26.280 --> 4:24:30.160]  they're saying and they're doing it in a massive program
[4:24:30.160 --> 4:24:34.840]  what's the definition of government the act or process of power
[4:24:34.840 --> 4:24:38.920]  and read over here so small screen the act of the process of power or governing
[4:24:38.920 --> 4:24:40.760]  government up there you go
[4:24:40.760 --> 4:24:44.360]  okay so so see i but every time i said i i get nitpicks and see that's a little
[4:24:44.360 --> 4:24:45.680]  joke in it picking
[4:24:45.680 --> 4:24:49.600]  it says international institutions in global governance program
[4:24:49.600 --> 4:24:52.520]  world order in twenty first century
[4:24:52.520 --> 4:24:56.480]  and i get emails going alex you lied i can't put people on your side of
[4:24:56.480 --> 4:24:59.120]  they didn't call for global government alex
[4:24:59.120 --> 4:25:03.640]  they call for global governance
[4:25:03.640 --> 4:25:07.760]  i just it doesn't compute i can't play the game anymore
[4:25:07.760 --> 4:25:10.880]  the point is they admit they're doing test on manipulating the atmosphere
[4:25:10.880 --> 4:25:11.720]  everywhere
[4:25:11.720 --> 4:25:14.600]  they put out government textbook saying they're spraying the skies for our
[4:25:14.600 --> 4:25:15.800]  safety
[4:25:15.800 --> 4:25:18.960]  you can do all that go up the textbooks for little kids
[4:25:18.960 --> 4:25:19.880]  you can
[4:25:19.880 --> 4:25:23.600]  read it and so here is obama that's what i said
[4:25:23.600 --> 4:25:25.960]  that's what i see that's what i said earlier
[4:25:25.960 --> 4:25:29.040]  they all that the fact that's what i said earlier
[4:25:29.040 --> 4:25:31.000]  that's what i said earlier
[4:25:31.000 --> 4:25:33.480]  that's what i said
[4:25:33.480 --> 4:25:36.520]  like howard you said bring in the milk here i mean i'm sure just repeating it
[4:25:36.520 --> 4:25:39.720]  to these people going back a few hours ago when they walked in and handed to me
[4:25:39.720 --> 4:25:40.280]  i said
[4:25:40.280 --> 4:25:43.560]  just like they've been spying for at least three decades without warrants on
[4:25:43.560 --> 4:25:47.720]  your phone calls your faxes and out in the later time your emails and the rest
[4:25:47.720 --> 4:25:48.360]  of it
[4:25:48.360 --> 4:25:50.200]  the last fifteen years
[4:25:50.200 --> 4:25:54.320]  that now they want to build a legalize it retroactively like they have a bill
[4:25:54.320 --> 4:25:56.760]  to turn the old military bases in the fema camps
[4:25:56.760 --> 4:25:59.320]  after they already did it
[4:25:59.320 --> 4:26:02.720]  so i made the point i said oh here they are saying they want to do it
[4:26:02.720 --> 4:26:06.040]  after they're already doing it i said that didn't i say that
[4:26:06.040 --> 4:26:09.800]  didn't i say that didn't i say that didn't i say that
[4:26:09.800 --> 4:26:14.600]  that camp trails are real i don't have time to play games with you anymore
[4:26:14.600 --> 4:26:19.360]  if your jackass friends are this cowardly in this week and they don't know the
[4:26:19.360 --> 4:26:22.280]  government's coming after our guns they've stolen
[4:26:22.280 --> 4:26:25.840]  twelve point eight trillion everything's going bankrupt they're building fema
[4:26:25.840 --> 4:26:29.200]  camps i can't help your friends
[4:26:29.200 --> 4:26:33.320]  who who are just completely into living in denial and not seeing what's in front
[4:26:33.320 --> 4:26:34.320]  of their face
[4:26:34.320 --> 4:26:36.840]  now i apologize for getting so mad
[4:26:36.840 --> 4:26:39.920]  i've been on air too long but but the michael bagner in closing you want to
[4:26:39.920 --> 4:26:43.120]  make any comments on what i was just saying
[4:26:43.120 --> 4:26:46.400]  that the same way in my constitution class and
[4:26:46.400 --> 4:26:47.200]  the people
[4:26:47.200 --> 4:26:50.400]  part who realize that are getting fired up to
[4:26:50.400 --> 4:26:52.440]  we are going to restore
[4:26:52.440 --> 4:26:55.320]  our constitution republic
[4:26:55.320 --> 4:26:58.600]  you know they're going to be a lot of people who are going to benefit from
[4:26:58.600 --> 4:27:00.040]  all of our activity
[4:27:00.040 --> 4:27:02.560]  and and they will still be denying it
[4:27:02.560 --> 4:27:05.320]  saying well you know there was never any problem
[4:27:05.320 --> 4:27:07.800]  uh... that's not our problem i
[4:27:07.800 --> 4:27:12.560]  i try not to get upset at the people who don't understand i just take advantage
[4:27:12.560 --> 4:27:14.200]  of the people who do
[4:27:14.200 --> 4:27:18.040]  are willing to understand that are that want the information
[4:27:18.040 --> 4:27:21.760]  because uh... we can do a lot more good there we're not going to have
[4:27:21.760 --> 4:27:23.760]  everybody agree with us
[4:27:23.760 --> 4:27:25.640]  and uh...
[4:27:25.640 --> 4:27:28.680]  the good news like it that we had a huge rally for
[4:27:28.680 --> 4:27:32.960]  ron paul's presidential campaign with that huge rallies all over for uh...
[4:27:32.960 --> 4:27:34.280]  texas tea parties
[4:27:34.280 --> 4:27:37.280]  that the anti-tax tea parties
[4:27:37.280 --> 4:27:41.800]  another's indication is that everybody seems to want to take my class
[4:27:41.800 --> 4:27:44.440]  uh... on the constitution well that's exciting
[4:27:44.440 --> 4:27:45.640]  my magnetic work

[4:27:54.480 --> 4:27:55.680]  of overdrive now
[4:27:55.680 --> 4:27:57.680]  i don't even care i'll just stay on the air look like
[4:27:57.680 --> 4:27:59.720]  i shouldn't have blown up at david florida
[4:27:59.720 --> 4:28:01.280]  but i'm getting death threats
[4:28:01.280 --> 4:28:04.960]  we have all sorts of weird crap going on around here i have the national media
[4:28:04.960 --> 4:28:06.200]  attacking me
[4:28:06.200 --> 4:28:09.120]  and it's this in it picking
[4:28:09.120 --> 4:28:11.520]  you know of course they introduce it in a way it sounds good
[4:28:11.520 --> 4:28:15.760]  it's like hr one four four four and and thirteen eighty eight
[4:28:15.760 --> 4:28:20.440]  said set up as national system to study and minister compulsory service and then
[4:28:20.440 --> 4:28:23.600]  i've got the books the documents what they've been setting up so i had my
[4:28:23.600 --> 4:28:24.600]  knowledge
[4:28:24.600 --> 4:28:27.880]  and i go it'll be eighteen twenty four for this in a military brigade will be
[4:28:27.880 --> 4:28:29.400]  an environmental brigade will be
[4:28:29.400 --> 4:28:31.840]  everything i said in film six seven years ago as i thought the feds were
[4:28:31.840 --> 4:28:33.240]  setting it up then
[4:28:33.240 --> 4:28:36.760]  you know i'll just read the a p article with with their crap i didn't add
[4:28:36.760 --> 4:28:38.200]  everything i know
[4:28:38.200 --> 4:28:40.760]  see that's all this two-dimensional thinking it's like lindbeck says this
[4:28:40.760 --> 4:28:41.880]  is a fake femicamp
[4:28:41.880 --> 4:28:43.280]  i can even predict what he's gonna do
[4:28:43.280 --> 4:28:46.320]  instead of all but look at all these other real camps
[4:28:46.320 --> 4:28:47.080]  you see
[4:28:47.080 --> 4:28:50.280]  uh... it's the same thing uh... with
[4:28:50.280 --> 4:28:52.000]  all of these issues
[4:28:52.000 --> 4:28:54.960]  i already knew that they had nasa in the federal government admit they were
[4:28:54.960 --> 4:28:55.880]  spraying
[4:28:55.880 --> 4:28:59.200]  they've been and i've called paul and and and and them on us so we got a lot more
[4:28:59.200 --> 4:29:02.360]  articles about this where he'll get more riders are right to three a day
[4:29:02.360 --> 4:29:03.520]  the great job
[4:29:03.520 --> 4:29:06.240]  uh... well how do you find riders that understand this stuff there's not that
[4:29:06.240 --> 4:29:07.080]  many
[4:29:07.080 --> 4:29:10.720]  i guess people could you know give us uh... examples and we can be on info
[4:29:10.720 --> 4:29:14.440]  wars dot com emails about me gets a lot of money to hire too many more
[4:29:14.440 --> 4:29:17.440]  pay a little bit or some of the point is is that
[4:29:17.440 --> 4:29:20.720]  is our articles tire thing together you know we'll show
[4:29:20.720 --> 4:29:23.520]  you know if they can go out to one funeral place and say oh no we're just
[4:29:23.520 --> 4:29:27.360]  expanding for dying veterans here with with these new graves we just so happen
[4:29:27.360 --> 4:29:28.000]  to put
[4:29:28.000 --> 4:29:30.720]  four-person per grave right by each other it's a new system
[4:29:30.720 --> 4:29:31.600]  maybe that's true
[4:29:31.600 --> 4:29:34.560]  but then we have new york state documents you can call where they're saying
[4:29:34.560 --> 4:29:36.560]  we're getting ready for mass flu pandemics
[4:29:36.560 --> 4:29:39.360]  we need you to get rid of all these mass graves and i have the rocky mountain
[4:29:39.360 --> 4:29:40.400]  news saying
[4:29:40.400 --> 4:29:42.840]  we were getting ready for the senators and mass graves
[4:29:42.840 --> 4:29:44.400]  and i give you the address
[4:29:44.400 --> 4:29:46.440]  and so you know it's this nitpicking it
[4:29:46.440 --> 4:29:48.320]  it's the same thing with this obama thing
[4:29:48.320 --> 4:29:51.640]  i said oh my god here they are saying they may have to do this to save us
[4:29:51.640 --> 4:29:55.400]  they always introduce it that way so this is an admission that they're
[4:29:55.400 --> 4:29:57.600]  terraforming that that exists
[4:29:57.600 --> 4:30:01.280]  that that's going on and then you go to the university documents we posted a
[4:30:01.280 --> 4:30:03.160]  link to they admit they're doing
[4:30:03.160 --> 4:30:06.480]  so my point is to have them admit it in the a p was a big deal
[4:30:06.480 --> 4:30:08.560]  and have all bonus guy doing
[4:30:08.560 --> 4:30:12.680]  and when they get one of his head guy is key science advisor said something
[4:30:12.680 --> 4:30:14.800]  that's what certification
[4:30:14.800 --> 4:30:17.920]  so yes the obama ministrations admitting they're doing this and you can get
[4:30:17.920 --> 4:30:19.120]  picked and say
[4:30:19.120 --> 4:30:23.280]  but why are you talking about the fact that they're talking about terraforming
[4:30:23.280 --> 4:30:24.960]  and saying we have to do this
[4:30:24.960 --> 4:30:27.760]  and then i've proven from her own documents they already are why isn't
[4:30:27.760 --> 4:30:31.200]  about what the hell are they doing why is it all about
[4:30:31.200 --> 4:30:34.080]  well g i don't know yet you know it's kind of i told people how they
[4:30:34.080 --> 4:30:36.000]  introduced fema camps
[4:30:36.000 --> 4:30:38.760]  i said they're gonna come out
[4:30:38.760 --> 4:30:43.600]  and they are going to uh... say oh it's for the homeless so you can't be
[4:30:43.600 --> 4:30:44.920]  homeless anymore
[4:30:44.920 --> 4:30:48.200]  and and there's crimes we got a search in disarming and we're gonna have a break
[4:30:48.200 --> 4:30:49.120]  on there and
[4:30:49.120 --> 4:30:52.120]  and and but don't worry and there's gonna be a medical center
[4:30:52.120 --> 4:30:56.000]  i said that for years how have they now announced it
[4:30:56.000 --> 4:30:59.320]  i mean i said exactly how glenn beck would do it and i understand this
[4:30:59.320 --> 4:30:59.880]  books
[4:30:59.880 --> 4:31:03.320]  i haven't taken calls all day hardly because i don't want to start
[4:31:03.320 --> 4:31:07.160]  because i'm passionate most hosts lean on the colors they lean on guests
[4:31:07.160 --> 4:31:08.920]  they do you know they don't want to be on air
[4:31:08.920 --> 4:31:12.280]  they want to be out playing golf or chasing tail i want to be here this is
[4:31:12.280 --> 4:31:15.080]  what i do i study them i know that i know the enemy
[4:31:15.080 --> 4:31:18.360]  i understand what they're doing they're gonna kill our asses these people mean
[4:31:18.360 --> 4:31:20.840]  business
[4:31:20.840 --> 4:31:24.400]  these people mean business man my whole life's on the line with this
[4:31:24.400 --> 4:31:30.200]  and you call into the show net picking
[4:31:30.200 --> 4:31:33.200]  i mean what i did in the interest of time was i condensed it all together i said
[4:31:33.200 --> 4:31:33.880]  we have the
[4:31:33.880 --> 4:31:34.760]  i said yes
[4:31:34.760 --> 4:31:37.120]  now they're introducing how we need it that's how they always do it after
[4:31:37.120 --> 4:31:38.240]  they've already been doing it
[4:31:38.240 --> 4:31:41.440]  we have the articles here's the name of the articles up on prison planet dot com
[4:31:41.440 --> 4:31:42.840]  where they admit they're doing
[4:31:42.840 --> 4:31:46.480]  so i made that all perfectly clear without adding a bunch of tremulous
[4:31:46.480 --> 4:31:48.800]  hesitation
[4:31:48.800 --> 4:31:50.960]  i mean i don't know who we need
[4:31:50.960 --> 4:31:54.240]  uh... you know he said seven years ago i make a film road to tyranny showing you
[4:31:54.240 --> 4:31:56.040]  the documents where they say we're all terrorist
[4:31:56.040 --> 4:31:59.800]  and now it's all big news everywhere i broke the myack report and i had my own
[4:31:59.800 --> 4:32:02.760]  people going i don't see ron paul there he's not in there and i'm like
[4:32:02.760 --> 4:32:04.320]  he's on page eight
[4:32:04.320 --> 4:32:06.200]  he's on page eight
[4:32:06.200 --> 4:32:09.320]  for screaming at the you know i can't handle this stuff man
[4:32:09.320 --> 4:32:12.360]  i know how this works is what i do
[4:32:12.360 --> 4:32:15.960]  i've interviewed thousands of experts i do this stuff eighteen hours a day
[4:32:15.960 --> 4:32:18.560]  i don't have time for your crap anymore
[4:32:18.560 --> 4:32:22.040]  and you know what you can do a better job get your own radio show get it there
[4:32:22.040 --> 4:32:23.640]  in florida go out and do it
[4:32:23.640 --> 4:32:26.720]  now i didn't claim to have all the answers
[4:32:26.720 --> 4:32:31.560]  but see instead it's going to be about all obama just says they may terraform
[4:32:31.560 --> 4:32:35.000]  i told you they admit they're already doing it my god
[4:32:35.000 --> 4:32:37.080]  my
[4:32:37.080 --> 4:32:40.240]  i guess everything's okay bernice cuz yeah the camps are real but you know
[4:32:40.240 --> 4:32:43.200]  they're only for safety well i don't think everything i mean who are these
[4:32:43.200 --> 4:32:44.800]  timid people
[4:32:44.800 --> 4:32:47.480]  well that alex i'm listening right now and
[4:32:47.480 --> 4:32:51.680]  and he he he said they're doing it but the obama just says they may have to
[4:32:51.680 --> 4:32:54.960]  let's let's be honest the point is they're saying it's real the point is
[4:32:54.960 --> 4:32:59.520]  they're saying they can manipulate the atmosphere spray aerosols that they're
[4:32:59.520 --> 4:33:01.160]  doing right now
[4:33:01.160 --> 4:33:04.320]  the point is they had met the fricking things real
[4:33:04.320 --> 4:33:08.520]  cod you people have been conditioned from birth to to to to to to not have any
[4:33:08.520 --> 4:33:13.240]  connection to reality to not see right through things to not go with it
[4:33:13.240 --> 4:33:16.600]  i mean how is it bizarre for me to say they're admitting they have chemtrails
[4:33:16.600 --> 4:33:20.120]  is my point they're admitting they have chemtrails they're admitting they have
[4:33:20.120 --> 4:33:23.880]  chemtrails they're admitting they have chemtrails
[4:33:23.880 --> 4:33:27.000]  we're spraying us in a secret program god
[4:33:27.000 --> 4:33:30.280]  i'm sorry go ahead bernice give us the latest info yeah you know uh...
[4:33:30.280 --> 4:33:33.880]  i got the second half of the document right here here's page one
[4:33:33.880 --> 4:33:37.080]  it's all about internet and how we're bad we're terrorists alex internet
[4:33:37.080 --> 4:33:40.680]  technology has emerged as the preferred medium for extremist communication and
[4:33:40.680 --> 4:33:44.320]  is increasingly being exploited to assist terrorists in achieving their
[4:33:44.320 --> 4:33:47.120]  goals it's used to recruit and radicalize
[4:33:47.120 --> 4:33:50.720]  uh... support of tears as a terrorist and then radical and extremists and they
[4:33:50.720 --> 4:33:54.160]  can call me an extremist it's all about exactly murder and bastard how dare they
[4:33:54.160 --> 4:33:57.400]  these groups solicit funds on their websites through donations are there
[4:33:57.400 --> 4:34:00.440]  them yes as well as the sales of various items including
[4:34:00.440 --> 4:34:04.160]  uh... publications audio and visual media here's where it gets great extremist
[4:34:04.160 --> 4:34:09.000]  groups also you actively use web forums blogs social networking sites such as
[4:34:09.000 --> 4:34:12.320]  youtube myspace google video and of course
[4:34:12.320 --> 4:34:13.040]  twitter
[4:34:13.040 --> 4:34:18.120]  uh... my god and then here's even better on the bottom they say twitter was
[4:34:18.120 --> 4:34:21.280]  used as a counter surveillance uh... command and control and the movement of
[4:34:21.280 --> 4:34:25.000]  tool by activists at the republican national convention you know where this
[4:34:25.000 --> 4:34:27.400]  car article comes out of
[4:34:27.400 --> 4:34:31.840]  al-qaeda like mobile discussions and potential creative uses so if you're
[4:34:31.840 --> 4:34:36.040]  protesting the uh... republican national trial kind of life yeah we'll see
[4:34:36.040 --> 4:34:39.520]  the scene and then they'll also go well it just mixes them in they're not saying
[4:34:39.520 --> 4:34:40.400]  they're al-qaeda
[4:34:40.400 --> 4:34:44.200]  they just say it's al-qaeda like i mean you said they were equating protestors
[4:34:44.200 --> 4:34:45.040]  with al-qaeda
[4:34:45.040 --> 4:34:48.680]  they just said al-qaeda like i don't think that really means they're equating
[4:34:48.680 --> 4:34:49.280]  them with them
[4:34:49.280 --> 4:34:54.280]  i don't think the government's really bad i don't believe it i don't know
[4:34:54.280 --> 4:34:57.800]  yeah it's absolutely like you said the general pop populous is so ignorant and
[4:34:57.800 --> 4:34:58.560]  mesmerized
[4:34:58.560 --> 4:35:01.400]  let me give you an example i want my really good friends back in new york he
[4:35:01.400 --> 4:35:03.560]  does a financial blog for one of the bigger
[4:35:03.560 --> 4:35:06.240]  you know fight i'm not gonna say the company but he does a big financial
[4:35:06.240 --> 4:35:09.640]  but i'm not getting yet we're so free so i said to him what do you think about

[4:38:26.600 --> 4:38:28.280]  first hour and they got uh...
[4:38:28.280 --> 4:38:31.320]  yet kaiser on second i got kaiser on the second hour i'm gonna be going over
[4:38:31.320 --> 4:38:35.400]  this cover that the whole first hour is going to be the got kaiser on the
[4:38:35.400 --> 4:38:37.000]  all calling with the back thing after that
[4:38:37.000 --> 4:38:40.000]  we got a big show tonight i got attacked for saying he was a government
[4:38:40.000 --> 4:38:42.720]  agent and he was going to establish in the back and then now it was proven
[4:38:42.720 --> 4:38:46.640]  right exactly as i said i mean you people have any respect for me
[4:38:46.640 --> 4:38:52.880]  you have any respect for me or is it just all we don't believe alex
[4:38:52.880 --> 4:38:55.760]  well you know people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones but that's all
[4:38:55.760 --> 4:38:58.960]  that i sounded apologetic and i said that's why i made me so mad
[4:38:58.960 --> 4:39:01.600]  he's like i'm sorry but i can't pour people at your show when you're blue
[4:39:01.600 --> 4:39:05.840]  blue i said hey this article right here and by the way they admit it there
[4:39:05.840 --> 4:39:08.160]  the point is they're admitting the chemtrails
[4:39:08.160 --> 4:39:10.720]  and that's my point instead of like inventing
[4:39:10.720 --> 4:39:15.440]  that i'm like it's just so nitpicky man it's just it's just it it drives me
[4:39:15.440 --> 4:39:18.480]  insane the point is they're spraying us okay
[4:39:18.480 --> 4:39:22.240]  and they're submitting that they're doing it and he goes no they're saying
[4:39:22.240 --> 4:39:26.240]  they're looking at it the point is they're admitting it's real and rolling
[4:39:26.240 --> 4:39:30.640]  it out the issue is that they're rolling it out
[4:39:30.640 --> 4:39:33.680]  my god and and i can have arguments all the people about their you know well
[4:39:33.680 --> 4:39:37.600]  there is a law i gotta take vaccines and i gotta explain to him
[4:39:37.600 --> 4:39:40.880]  oh right there the terrorists won't take shots
[4:39:40.880 --> 4:39:44.000]  i you know what as soon as you said it i was just pulling out a random page
[4:39:44.000 --> 4:39:47.120]  can't handle anymore it's public health and health care part of the terrorism
[4:39:47.120 --> 4:39:50.400]  uh so what are the terrorists believing well let's see sector list criteria
[4:39:50.400 --> 4:39:54.400]  prime primary hhs owned or managed pharmaceutical and medical equipment
[4:39:54.400 --> 4:39:57.520]  stockpile sites uh centered for disease control
[4:39:57.520 --> 4:40:01.280]  this is forced inoculation yeah it looks like that's exactly what this is
[4:40:01.280 --> 4:40:04.880]  oh my god i mean i gotta sit down with this dot i mean
[4:40:04.880 --> 4:40:08.560]  folks it's not easy going through this with their double speak to because
[4:40:08.560 --> 4:40:11.440]  everything is good for you and yeah everybody knows i made up the mic
[4:40:11.440 --> 4:40:14.560]  report i'm still being accused of that and that was a big thing a lot of
[4:40:14.560 --> 4:40:17.360]  people really said that that was was a totally fair support they're still
[4:40:17.360 --> 4:40:20.640]  it's all still there you know i'm made it up they say
[4:40:20.640 --> 4:40:23.200]  i mean and you know again i covered this on my show i had someone
[4:40:23.200 --> 4:40:26.000]  matter the head of the my thing just resigned yeah
[4:40:26.000 --> 4:40:30.000]  yeah that's right that doesn't exist doesn't exist doesn't matter that i get
[4:40:30.000 --> 4:40:32.560]  calls that people are getting pulled over in los angeles county for having
[4:40:32.560 --> 4:40:36.640]  ron paul away bumper so there's video of it in los vegas
[4:40:36.640 --> 4:40:39.440]  you know we're all just terrorists alex we should just give in and bow down
[4:40:39.440 --> 4:40:43.120]  but you know i mean look look look let's say 90 percent of what i'm saying
[4:40:43.120 --> 4:40:46.800]  zachary and really it's like 110 it's worse than what i'm saying
[4:40:46.800 --> 4:40:51.440]  you know um it's worse than what i'm saying
[4:40:51.440 --> 4:40:56.240]  and but let's just say 10 percent was true hypothetically i mean is that not
[4:40:56.240 --> 4:41:01.040]  bad i mean were we not screwed with that
[4:41:01.040 --> 4:41:04.080]  yeah absolutely i mean the government's admitting for your safety we're going to
[4:41:04.080 --> 4:41:08.160]  chemtrail yeah oh jesus that's what this means see i know
[4:41:08.160 --> 4:41:10.640]  their language but they say oh we're looking at spraying the
[4:41:10.640 --> 4:41:14.480]  atmosphere with particulates to save you i know they've already admitted in a
[4:41:14.480 --> 4:41:17.200]  bunch of government documents so the point is they're rolling it out is the
[4:41:17.200 --> 4:41:22.160]  big issue and so i tell you what the meaning of it is it's like a translator
[4:41:22.160 --> 4:41:25.200]  the president's new science advisors at wednesday the global warming is so dire
[4:41:25.200 --> 4:41:27.840]  that obama administration is discussing radical technologies
[4:41:27.840 --> 4:41:33.280]  to cool earth's air john holdren told the associated president's interview since
[4:41:33.280 --> 4:41:35.840]  first interview being confirmed last month that the idea of geoengineering
[4:41:35.840 --> 4:41:39.440]  the climate is being discussed see chemtrails are so big in his first
[4:41:39.440 --> 4:41:43.200]  interview this is what he says but see being discussed they're testing it when
[4:41:43.200 --> 4:41:46.720]  you go read the sites it's all testing this is all just testing
[4:41:46.720 --> 4:41:51.600]  just like u.s. code title 50 chapter 32 says this is 1528 paragraph b
[4:41:51.600 --> 4:41:55.440]  says oh well we can use chemical biologicals or radiologicals on you
[4:41:55.440 --> 4:41:59.520]  without your consent unless it's part of law enforcement or testing
[4:41:59.520 --> 4:42:02.320]  then we don't have to tell you and then i and then there's big law firms
[4:42:02.320 --> 4:42:05.120]  reporting on them that it says that and people say oh it doesn't really
[4:42:05.120 --> 4:42:13.120]  you're you're reading that wrong okay whatever mac
[4:42:13.120 --> 4:42:18.880]  good god tinker with climate is just his personal view however he went on to
[4:42:18.880 --> 4:42:24.160]  say that he raised an administration discussions
[4:42:24.160 --> 4:42:27.120]  he's far from alone and talking geoengineering
[4:42:27.120 --> 4:42:30.160]  the national academy of science is making climate tinkering the subject of
[4:42:30.160 --> 4:42:32.880]  its first workshop in the multi-discipline climate
[4:42:32.880 --> 4:42:35.760]  challenges program the british parliament has also discussed the idea
[4:42:35.760 --> 4:42:39.840]  see they're now rolling it out to you folks the american meteorological
[4:42:39.840 --> 4:42:43.360]  society is crafting a policy statement on geoengineering that says it is
[4:42:43.360 --> 4:42:47.040]  prudent to consider geoengineering potential to understand its limits and
[4:42:47.040 --> 4:42:50.400]  to avoid rash deployment
[4:42:50.400 --> 4:42:54.000]  so the point is they're introducing this to the slaves
[4:42:54.000 --> 4:42:58.400]  and then i went on to say that we have articles where they're admitting it you
[4:42:58.400 --> 4:43:01.200]  can go read them in fact we see a watch and has a guy promise to go to your
[4:43:01.200 --> 4:43:04.720]  calls i'm just out of control linda in california on the air thanks for

[4:43:56.160 --> 4:43:59.920]  what the word says you can fully line up where we are right now
[4:43:59.920 --> 4:44:04.720]  in the bible and that it says that and i had called jason the other night
[4:44:04.720 --> 4:44:09.760]  that kingdom versus kingdom we've had nations against nations we're a kingdom
[4:44:09.760 --> 4:44:14.880]  of light versus kingdom of darkness we have an obligation to lay down our
[4:44:14.880 --> 4:44:19.040]  life for the brethren and it doesn't mean just stand in a firing squad
[4:44:19.040 --> 4:44:22.880]  lay down your life not caring what other people think but getting the truth to
[4:44:22.880 --> 4:44:26.560]  them i'll roll down my window at a intersection go if you're heard of the
[4:44:26.560 --> 4:44:31.040]  new world order go to info wars i pass out flyers i call the
[4:44:31.040 --> 4:44:37.440]  all the government i do email campaigns we have an obligation
[4:44:37.440 --> 4:44:42.320]  to to tell them that judgment the sword is coming in the book of Ezekiel
[4:44:42.320 --> 4:44:46.560]  exactly and i mean we're going to see it i mean regardless of its people their
[4:44:46.560 --> 4:44:50.480]  blood on our hands we have a duty
[4:44:50.480 --> 4:44:57.200]  to our nation as to our world as as your you you stand for humanity will not
[4:44:57.200 --> 4:45:02.720]  just as christian standing for jesus we need to stand for humanity in general
[4:45:02.720 --> 4:45:05.600]  and lay down our life and not care what people think
[4:45:05.600 --> 4:45:09.120]  he who endures to the end shall be saved if the world
[4:45:09.120 --> 4:45:13.280]  we're in linda linda i totally i totally hear you and i agree with you
[4:45:13.280 --> 4:45:16.800]  and you know all the disciples being killed or put in prison
[4:45:16.800 --> 4:45:19.760]  jesus being killed for not doing what government said
[4:45:19.760 --> 4:45:23.680]  the prophets being killed it you know not doing what the king says being put
[4:45:23.680 --> 4:45:28.880]  in the fiery furnace the lion's den the moses not doing what pharaoh said
[4:45:28.880 --> 4:45:32.480]  but according to them no roman's 13 moses should have knelt down
[4:45:32.480 --> 4:45:36.960]  uh you know before the pharaoh ramsey's it should have licked his boots
[4:45:36.960 --> 4:45:40.000]  you know because and that's what the government finances roman's 13 so
[4:45:40.000 --> 4:45:43.680]  whether it's the end of the world or not we have a duty and if people really
[4:45:43.680 --> 4:45:48.080]  had christ in their heart they really had a yaoi in their heart they would be
[4:45:48.080 --> 4:45:51.920]  uncontrollably fighting a new world order who's running child kidnapping
[4:45:51.920 --> 4:45:55.120]  rings everything else i mean i just rage against them wanting to fight them
[4:45:55.120 --> 4:45:58.560]  and stop them and can't control myself wanting to resist them
[4:45:58.560 --> 4:46:02.800]  and the people are like oh praise god it's almost the end i'll be teleported
[4:46:02.800 --> 4:46:05.840]  out of here soon what a cop out good to hear from you
[4:46:05.840 --> 4:46:10.320]  linda leon in georgia you're on the air go ahead leon
[4:46:10.320 --> 4:46:16.320]  yes hi alex i have a question uh a little bit of information and a request
[4:46:16.320 --> 4:46:20.400]  of you uh first off have you ever read or are you
[4:46:20.400 --> 4:46:25.520]  familiar with a book called the red amendment by lb board
[4:46:25.520 --> 4:46:31.520]  no i haven't all right um if i may i'd like to read just a
[4:46:31.520 --> 4:46:36.640]  little bit of a paragraph from the preface says that you will find that you
[4:46:36.640 --> 4:46:40.000]  have not been living under the true constitution
[4:46:40.000 --> 4:46:44.320]  that was established by the founding father you will find that you have been
[4:46:44.320 --> 4:46:48.800]  removed from your lawful country under the semblance of law
[4:46:48.800 --> 4:46:51.920]  hence you will find you are not living in a free state
[4:46:51.920 --> 4:46:57.120]  as you have been told you will find out that you are living under dictatorial
[4:46:57.120 --> 4:47:02.160]  rule all these facts will be clearly demonstrated with legal reference and so
[4:47:02.160 --> 4:47:07.520]  on my request would you please have lb board
[4:47:07.520 --> 4:47:14.400]  on your show and you can find him at packinlaw.org
[4:47:14.400 --> 4:47:19.200]  pack is pac stands for people awareness coalition

[4:47:28.400 --> 4:47:31.840]  legal quack i'm not i'm not familiar with them and i have to specifically
[4:47:31.840 --> 4:47:35.120]  look at what they're talking about myself but i mean you you seem to think
[4:47:35.120 --> 4:47:38.400]  it's pretty convincing uh what is he specifically talking about how we're
[4:47:38.400 --> 4:47:43.280]  under the corporate uh district of columbia and after the civil war or
[4:47:43.280 --> 4:47:51.200]  what is he claiming he goes into all of it um it's a treaty
[4:47:51.200 --> 4:47:57.840]  uh what he says is that the treaty included in the 17 late 1790s
[4:47:57.840 --> 4:48:01.520]  between uh the united states and uh and the queen
[4:48:01.520 --> 4:48:07.120]  of the king it has it has regard the 14th amendment
[4:48:07.120 --> 4:48:10.080]  yeah i don't know that's yeah i mean that's what i figured well that that's
[4:48:10.080 --> 4:48:14.320]  got a lot of truth to it uh and they did conclude trade treaties of
[4:48:14.320 --> 4:48:17.600]  a truce with the queen uh i mean the king after the war people
[4:48:17.600 --> 4:48:20.640]  misconstrued that as a sellout it really wasn't but certainly
[4:48:20.640 --> 4:48:24.080]  yeah what happened after the civil war is real we'll look into that thanks for
[4:48:24.080 --> 4:48:26.320]  holding to bring that up i need to get to everybody else here
[4:48:26.320 --> 4:48:30.000]  robert in texas robert you're on the air

[4:48:54.240 --> 4:48:56.720]  little bit of information i wanted to share with you
[4:48:56.720 --> 4:49:03.760]  the question was um um my girlfriend of all and i have noticed these weird
[4:49:03.760 --> 4:49:07.280]  polls that they're putting up up up and down i35
[4:49:07.280 --> 4:49:12.160]  we live down here in kyle just out of you and um they have these cameras on them
[4:49:12.160 --> 4:49:16.880]  and these like weird little dishes uh like little square platforms
[4:49:16.880 --> 4:49:21.360]  you know they've admitted that that's now homeland security and oh all the
[4:49:21.360 --> 4:49:24.320]  cameras will now be used to watch you and the gunshot detectors
[4:49:24.320 --> 4:49:29.040]  they really are microphones that listen to you i mean i remember in 1998 they
[4:49:29.040 --> 4:49:32.320]  put wireless microphone shotgun mics all over austin
[4:49:32.320 --> 4:49:37.200]  and the company went into your car uh no but it can hear a couple hundred yards
[4:49:37.200 --> 4:49:40.480]  away that was the whole demonstration they call them gunshot detectors
[4:49:40.480 --> 4:49:42.880]  and then now they're announcing everywhere these are going up it's all
[4:49:42.880 --> 4:49:46.640]  pentagon controlled all over the country but most these cameras with the
[4:49:46.640 --> 4:49:48.880]  resolution are hooked into license plate reading
[4:49:48.880 --> 4:49:52.720]  software and then that goes into the threat integration fusion centers
[4:49:52.720 --> 4:49:56.800]  put in by fema and then they put army liaisons in with the police
[4:49:56.800 --> 4:50:00.480]  i mean it's hellish it's a uh same system they've got to control
[4:50:00.480 --> 4:50:03.760]  iraq in fact they bragged in mit magazine
[4:50:03.760 --> 4:50:07.040]  about it a few years ago i was in a restaurant saw a copy at the bar and was
[4:50:07.040 --> 4:50:10.160]  reading it i already knew about it from other articles but it was all there
[4:50:10.160 --> 4:50:13.600]  bragging about how it's a it's a surveillance grid
[4:50:13.600 --> 4:50:18.080]  wow because yeah i looked it up because we were we we see them go up and then a
[4:50:18.080 --> 4:50:21.600]  lot of them are you know they're brand new they're all up and down 35 and i
[4:50:21.600 --> 4:50:24.640]  figured you'd find out because you know you're up and all that what you found
[4:50:24.640 --> 4:50:26.800]  out about particular unit you're looking at
[4:50:26.800 --> 4:50:32.160]  okay um there's a website this is really really really big i think personally
[4:50:32.160 --> 4:50:35.760]  because this is this kind of technology there's a lot of uh
[4:50:35.760 --> 4:50:38.960]  talk around it's what people call conspiracy and whatnot
[4:50:38.960 --> 4:50:42.400]  but there's a site that's called powercast.com i don't know if you've
[4:50:42.400 --> 4:50:47.600]  heard of it have you heard of that powercast powercast.com boy this is a
[4:50:47.600 --> 4:50:50.000]  big if you haven't heard of this you're gonna love this
[4:50:50.000 --> 4:50:53.680]  um just go there check it out it's it's uh basically
[4:50:53.680 --> 4:50:58.720]  uh wireless electricity if if you know about what nicole tesla which i'm sure
[4:50:58.720 --> 4:51:01.920]  you do and the listeners you know about nicole tesla
[4:51:01.920 --> 4:51:07.360]  uh tal jp morgan shut him down uh the way back and as this specifically i mean
[4:51:07.360 --> 4:51:10.320]  is this specifically dealing with these cameras
[4:51:10.320 --> 4:51:15.040]  no it has our uh has to do with rfid uh technology also
[4:51:15.040 --> 4:51:19.440]  and the the uh front what is this specifically with these cameras
[4:51:19.440 --> 4:51:22.000]  no those cameras was a separate thing that was a question i was asking you
[4:51:22.000 --> 4:51:25.760]  to go about those are i doubt those are beamed
[4:51:25.760 --> 4:51:29.280]  i mean no no no no that was separate i was just asking about those i don't
[4:51:29.280 --> 4:51:31.440]  know about those cameras i didn't know what they were
[4:51:31.440 --> 4:51:35.840]  i just wanted to mention about it it's a wireless unit to a main station where
[4:51:35.840 --> 4:51:39.600]  they beam the signal so it's not beaming power it's beaming
[4:51:39.600 --> 4:51:42.560]  the signal but you can with lasers like beam
[4:51:42.560 --> 4:51:46.320]  computer data well this is wired this uh powercast
[4:51:46.320 --> 4:51:51.200]  website um they they claim that it is basically broadcast
[4:51:51.200 --> 4:51:54.320]  this energy broadcast that there's not even supposed to be around this
[4:51:54.320 --> 4:51:58.480]  technology is not supposed to be around and and it's there if you go to it
[4:51:58.480 --> 4:52:01.600]  and you know what's really creepy alexa if you look at the front page
[4:52:01.600 --> 4:52:05.520]  you'll see that the way they have it all decorated there's a guy it shows a guy
[4:52:05.520 --> 4:52:08.160]  with a gun on there uh you know in famo and
[4:52:08.160 --> 4:52:11.040]  all suited up and then on the right it'll show it shows like different
[4:52:11.040 --> 4:52:14.240]  features of it and one of the things it mentions is rfid
[4:52:14.240 --> 4:52:18.880]  that it you'll basically have a device it's wireless that won't need to charge
[4:52:18.880 --> 4:52:22.000]  it's self-charges all the time
[4:52:22.000 --> 4:52:25.520]  it over a frequency it has like an a little antenna in it
[4:52:25.520 --> 4:52:29.280]  you plug this thing with an antenna and you have anything else with an antenna
[4:52:29.280 --> 4:52:34.080]  it takes the power wirelessly okay it's not supposed to be around
[4:52:34.080 --> 4:52:37.760]  and and it's out there now i you know i'm not hearing about it on the news or
[4:52:37.760 --> 4:52:41.280]  anything this is huge i mean that's like breakthrough crazy breakthrough
[4:52:41.280 --> 4:52:43.840]  technology
[4:52:44.640 --> 4:52:47.600]  all right i'll look into it there's also a lot of crap on the internet with fake
[4:52:47.600 --> 4:52:51.280]  generators and stuff but thank you so much i appreciate your call yeah i'm
[4:52:51.280 --> 4:52:54.960]  looking at it right now i've found the thing about
[4:52:54.960 --> 4:52:59.840]  powercast.com that's uh not that it's about casting metal
[4:52:59.840 --> 4:53:05.760]  whatever thank you uh let's talk to uh who's up next here
[4:53:05.760 --> 4:53:09.200]  nick and pia you're on the air go ahead
[4:53:09.200 --> 4:53:12.960]  yeah hey alex jason uh let's open up speak with michael badnark
[4:53:12.960 --> 4:53:16.960]  this is nick ranji and philly uh the man who got visited by secret service
[4:53:16.960 --> 4:53:21.040]  last year after confronting uh bill clinton set a few goons out
[4:53:21.040 --> 4:53:24.160]  oh yeah there you ask people questions ron london yeah
[4:53:24.160 --> 4:53:27.840]  well you know given given the myac report these fusion center documents
[4:53:27.840 --> 4:53:32.160]  coming out um i think it would be extremely prudent if we could
[4:53:32.160 --> 4:53:35.680]  take a moment and just discuss how to how to handle police encounters how to
[4:53:35.680 --> 4:53:39.360]  handle yourself if you ever are to be interrogated by
[4:53:39.360 --> 4:53:44.960]  say the secret service um people have to understand that the constitution
[4:53:44.960 --> 4:53:48.880]  is not from the point from which we derive our rights it's simply the
[4:53:48.880 --> 4:53:52.960]  the you know enunciation of what the government has to abide to its their
[4:53:52.960 --> 4:53:59.040]  contract your rights are enforced by you taking the initiative
[4:53:59.040 --> 4:54:02.640]  and upholding uh your natural rights and that's the
[4:54:02.640 --> 4:54:05.680]  fact of the matter is that when we get into these conversations like luke
[4:54:05.680 --> 4:54:09.840]  radowski and uh we are change ohio folks did last week over at the al gore
[4:54:09.840 --> 4:54:13.840]  event uh they're going to attempt to intimidate you get you to incriminate
[4:54:13.840 --> 4:54:17.520]  yourself and if you don't know your rights then you're
[4:54:17.520 --> 4:54:22.720]  going to end up uh getting an adhesion contracts and signing away your rights
[4:54:22.720 --> 4:54:25.440]  for privileges
[4:54:26.960 --> 4:54:31.600]  yeah yeah yeah so um i was yeah i was hoping that
[4:54:31.600 --> 4:54:34.640]  mike baton eric might give people basic tutorial on that
[4:54:34.640 --> 4:54:38.560]  but um and in my own experience recently we've been getting into a lot of
[4:54:38.560 --> 4:54:41.760]  a lot of constitutional issues in the courtroom dealing with traffic
[4:54:41.760 --> 4:54:46.720]  disputes just general civil liberties issues and we're finding more and more
[4:54:46.720 --> 4:54:50.960]  that a lot of these adhesion contracts the uh social security cards
[4:54:50.960 --> 4:54:56.720]  drivers licenses etc are um in many ways um
[4:54:56.720 --> 4:55:00.240]  sacrificing our our god-given rights for the privileges of the state
[4:55:00.240 --> 4:55:03.360]  yeah they have you wave them and that was to get you trained to do it
[4:55:03.360 --> 4:55:06.960]  now they're just color of law and by general acceptance they tried to make
[4:55:06.960 --> 4:55:10.240]  it like a common law and they come after you if you don't have all of it and
[4:55:10.240 --> 4:55:13.040]  they're so brainwashed they don't know now they're now saying second
[4:55:13.040 --> 4:55:16.400]  amendments are privileged and if we accept that claim they'll then start
[4:55:16.400 --> 4:55:19.840]  enforcing it it's like they claim traveling's a privilege when it's not
[4:55:19.840 --> 4:55:22.720]  thank you so much good to hear from you nick carangy great guy
[4:55:22.720 --> 4:55:27.200]  uh let's talk to uh louise in missouri you're on the air go ahead
[4:55:27.200 --> 4:55:32.480]  hello hi i'm actually here with representative jim guest in missouri
[4:55:32.480 --> 4:55:36.400]  um this is our office i was trying to make sure he's gonna be able to get down
[4:55:36.400 --> 4:55:39.600]  here because uh he is currently on the house
[4:55:39.600 --> 4:55:43.600]  more and they've been back and forth voting oh i i mean i didn't know that
[4:55:43.600 --> 4:55:46.800]  jim guest wanted to come on the show or i would have had him on or you just
[4:55:46.800 --> 4:55:51.040]  it's hard to get back and forth but i'll hand his phone to him
[4:55:51.040 --> 4:55:55.600]  um the real problem we're having and like you you know anything we say
[4:55:55.600 --> 4:56:00.480]  everybody says oh that's crazy you know uh we've tried for a long time
[4:56:00.480 --> 4:56:04.240]  and i'll pass it on to him but uh he's currently in and out of session so if
[4:56:04.240 --> 4:56:07.600]  you have to jump out uh you all okay well what a surprising
[4:56:07.600 --> 4:56:11.040]  call um sure go ahead hold on here is
[4:56:11.040 --> 4:56:14.160]  hello alec hey representative guest i didn't know you've been holding while
[4:56:14.160 --> 4:56:17.840]  i was ranting and raving something like a big must be going on if you called in
[4:56:17.840 --> 4:56:22.720]  i apologize now what's going on we are voting on bills up on the floor there's
[4:56:22.720 --> 4:56:27.440]  lost the base i ran down here i heard that uh you were on about this and
[4:56:27.440 --> 4:56:31.360]  you know the more i delve into this the more questions people are asking and
[4:56:31.360 --> 4:56:34.800]  i'm planning on having a hearing here in the uh
[4:56:34.800 --> 4:56:40.800]  state capital before my committee on real id and personal privacy calling the
[4:56:40.800 --> 4:56:45.360]  public safety the department of my act and department highway patrol request
[4:56:45.360 --> 4:56:49.600]  that they come to a hearing so we can ask them further questions i just come
[4:56:49.600 --> 4:56:53.200]  trying to get somebody to admit that this is tied into the federal level
[4:56:53.200 --> 4:56:56.320]  and that's where the directive is coming down to because there's just
[4:56:56.320 --> 4:57:00.800]  more unanswered questions and every day we find out like
[4:57:00.800 --> 4:57:03.920]  here in missouri that when you go to get your driver's license they do a
[4:57:03.920 --> 4:57:07.520]  background check on you through a national database
[4:57:07.520 --> 4:57:12.720]  right now it may be somewhat innocent as far as checking for uh
[4:57:12.720 --> 4:57:15.920]  lack of trial support payments a few things like that but once they start
[4:57:15.920 --> 4:57:19.360]  staffing link up to other databases uh you know they're going to do a complete
[4:57:19.360 --> 4:57:23.440]  background check on you so that's some of our concerns and let's say we're
[4:57:23.440 --> 4:57:27.120]  continuing to here and then with this fiasco at the St. Louis airport a couple
[4:57:27.120 --> 4:57:30.720]  weeks ago with the campaign for liberty employee that's really got a lot of
[4:57:30.720 --> 4:57:34.000]  people that's left here yeah they see you have a couple thousand in cash and they
[4:57:34.000 --> 4:57:37.120]  say we're calling the FBI and i'm allowed to have cash slave
[4:57:37.120 --> 4:57:41.360]  uh in fact i want to schedule you back on the show sir for those that don't know
[4:57:41.360 --> 4:57:47.600]  you're represented there uh who's who's uh introduced the bill uh to reaffirm
[4:57:47.600 --> 4:57:51.600]  states rights also some second amendment issues there very very exciting
[4:57:51.600 --> 4:57:55.760]  so i want to get a report on that we just got a hundred and something page
[4:57:55.760 --> 4:57:59.840]  2009 virginia terrorism threat assessment that if
[4:57:59.840 --> 4:58:06.240]  believe it or not uh is even worse than what the feds wrote up for Missouri
[4:58:06.240 --> 4:58:11.840]  but but on on another front um i heard there's been some resignations and
[4:58:11.840 --> 4:58:14.640]  things and then lieutenant governor i know i've seen the press conference
[4:58:14.640 --> 4:58:17.920]  came out and talked about how this is demonizing conservatives libertarians
[4:58:17.920 --> 4:58:21.920]  and others uh so can you just briefly uh representative guests tell us where the
[4:58:21.920 --> 4:58:26.720]  bill is to get state sovereignty all had to great we uh i presented it in the
[4:58:26.720 --> 4:58:30.640]  senate side yesterday and i got a very positive either
[4:58:30.640 --> 4:58:35.040]  response from the uh committee chairman who is the Missouri floor leader
[4:58:35.040 --> 4:58:38.640]  fully supports that i hope it comes to a flow don't have
[4:58:38.640 --> 4:58:42.880]  a floor vote there within the next couple weeks and i would expect a strong
[4:58:42.880 --> 4:58:45.920]  support for anybody that thinks they want to support the
[4:58:45.920 --> 4:58:49.200]  federal involvement in their government or private lives that
[4:58:49.200 --> 4:58:52.640]  be pushed to vote against them so i'm very positive about getting that one
[4:58:52.640 --> 4:58:56.720]  and i've got my bill to reject the real idea in the Missouri moving along now
[4:58:56.720 --> 4:59:00.480]  so we can cut some good things going you have to keep fighting to get them
[4:59:00.480 --> 4:59:03.040]  pushed through though absolutely but there were some
[4:59:03.040 --> 4:59:05.680]  resignations and things over the mic report
[4:59:05.680 --> 4:59:10.240]  right the director of the my act has been re-assigned put it that way to
[4:59:10.240 --> 4:59:12.960]  another division there and they've got a
[4:59:12.960 --> 4:59:17.120]  a new director and uh they've kind of admitted that's why i want to have my
[4:59:17.120 --> 4:59:21.360]  hearing to that that i think uh the employee was just writing that up and
[4:59:21.360 --> 4:59:25.280]  releasing it without uh basically in the oversight at all so uh that's
[4:59:25.280 --> 4:59:29.040]  certainly a responsibility in our department
[4:59:29.040 --> 4:59:32.640]  yeah well the media has been trying to link ron paul libertarians conservatives
[4:59:32.640 --> 4:59:36.720]  the terrorist lately and the white supremacist and others
[4:59:36.720 --> 4:59:40.560]  and it's a totally made up they need to just deal with some of the groups that
[4:59:40.560 --> 4:59:44.080]  have shown their violent and dangerous and not mix people with ron paul
[4:59:44.080 --> 4:59:47.040]  bumper stickers into that because there's no evidence of that and it's wrong
[4:59:47.040 --> 4:59:49.600]  and uh fire out your website representative for folks that want to
[4:59:49.600 --> 4:59:51.600]  find out more about the fine work you're doing
[4:59:51.600 --> 4:59:56.480]  okay we uh i've got two of them the laury legislators against real id
[4:59:56.480 --> 5:00:03.360]  dot com and then my state website at the gym guest dot com
[5:00:03.360 --> 5:00:08.000]  and then uh i've got uh those there and they got some links to some other sites
[5:00:08.000 --> 5:00:14.160]  to my the gym guest show dot com which i have a weekly radio program on that
[5:00:14.160 --> 5:00:17.600]  anyway we have you know been working on this we kind of discovered a few years
[5:00:17.600 --> 5:00:20.800]  ago that possibly this diet thing was connected to them now
[5:00:20.800 --> 5:00:23.920]  some of the pieces are starting to fall in place now
[5:00:23.920 --> 5:00:27.440]  well god bless you sir and i appreciate you coming on we'll talk to you soon
[5:00:27.440 --> 5:00:31.360]  i would uh next time if you contact us let us uh let us know it's you for the
[5:00:31.360 --> 5:00:34.960]  thank you so much all right thank you sir you know i got to leave it there
[5:00:34.960 --> 5:00:38.560]  because i've got to go write questions for arrows get on a plane to martin
[5:00:38.560 --> 5:00:43.680]  speak of the kansas city going to kansas city to interview a financial expert
[5:00:43.680 --> 5:00:47.200]  for the film the second obama film it's
