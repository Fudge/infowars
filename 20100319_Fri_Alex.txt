[00:00.000 --> 00:14.180]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.180 --> 00:33.860]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones we are live ladies
[00:33.860 --> 00:43.580]  and gentlemen Friday the 19th day of March 2010 thank you so much for joining us on this
[00:43.580 --> 00:48.660]  Friday edition well they're talking about even trying to pass the health care bill today
[00:48.660 --> 00:54.060]  or over the weekend or next week and we're going to be talking a lot about exactly what
[00:54.060 --> 01:02.300]  is in the health care bill and how it's unconstitutional and illegal and discriminatory on so many
[01:02.300 --> 01:11.060]  fronts and the types of draconian police state measures that are in the bill Republicans
[01:11.060 --> 01:23.300]  assail IRS provision in health care bill this is a vast expanse of power congressman said
[01:23.300 --> 01:30.340]  in the bill it allows the IRS to take your paycheck or your refunds to make you buy
[01:30.340 --> 01:36.500]  health insurance so they just take your money this is the IRS minding you running your life
[01:36.500 --> 01:41.100]  this abusive unaccountable collection agency for the private Federal Reserve and that's
[01:41.100 --> 01:47.540]  why they're taking this money is to fund the banks I saw another report two days ago where
[01:47.540 --> 01:52.840]  they are now taking the major private pension funds with the CEO's the government is and
[01:52.840 --> 02:09.060]  having them invest that into the banking system so that is coming up as well today we come
[02:09.060 --> 02:17.300]  back from break I'm going to go over the different angles of the health care bill 38 state attorney
[02:17.300 --> 02:22.820]  generals are saying it's illegal fact I heard the Texas Attorney General on KLBJ this morning
[02:22.820 --> 02:26.840]  talking about it and I agree with him I'm going to repeat some of the things he talked about
[02:26.840 --> 02:34.600]  and then I've got news like this Pentagon sees a threat from online muckrakers New York Times
[02:34.600 --> 02:40.840]  this came out yesterday saying oh yes they want to shut down people exposing the government and
[02:40.840 --> 02:46.360]  that dovetails with cybersecurity bill introduced in the Senate but don't worry there's been a
[02:46.360 --> 02:50.800]  major change this is a quote from Reuters one major change the bill is that the president would
[02:50.800 --> 02:56.040]  no longer have the power to shut down the internet unilaterally oh great but would have to work
[02:56.040 --> 03:00.280]  within the industry to draw up plans in the event of a national emergency so it says the
[03:00.280 --> 03:05.440]  president consults with who he wants and then he has a limited power so all great he can still
[03:05.440 --> 03:11.040]  shut it down every once just total tyranny there's a scene at news article emergency
[03:11.040 --> 03:15.800]  internet control bill gets a rewrite but it goes on to report that it's meet the new boss
[03:15.800 --> 03:21.560]  same as the old boss and they admit their target is people exposing government documents 911
[03:21.560 --> 03:27.360]  truth you name it because we are killing them politically we are annihilating them and to
[03:27.360 --> 03:32.920]  go ahead and try to start curtailing and shutting down the web it's too late crooks genies out
[03:32.920 --> 03:37.960]  of the bottle cats out of the bag horse already left the barn train already left the station
[03:37.960 --> 03:43.320]  Humpty Dumpty already fell off the wall and all the king's horses and all the king's men
[03:43.320 --> 03:47.900]  and all the king's media and brainwashing and propaganda and homeland security and my
[03:47.900 --> 03:52.600]  act reports and Southern Prairie Law Center and ADL can't put your stinking tyranny back

[04:13.000 --> 04:18.200]  it every state in the union they're going to decide how hot and how cold your house
[04:18.200 --> 04:23.840]  is you want to be a prisoner you want to live in a giant prison in a prison the warden controls

[05:12.280 --> 05:16.200]  true seeds that all perform even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible
[05:16.200 --> 05:20.480]  that could even happen again so our friends at solutions from science have put together

[06:05.680 --> 06:11.960]  this is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that we're
[06:11.960 --> 06:16.880]  pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've turned a tremendous influence on our
[06:16.880 --> 06:22.880]  president in congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[06:22.880 --> 06:28.960]  as American citizens to pay attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[06:28.960 --> 06:35.040]  the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing
[06:35.040 --> 06:40.040]  world government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more matches and the
[06:40.040 --> 06:44.720]  congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right
[06:44.720 --> 06:51.760]  now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic yet your copy of fall of the republic on

[07:01.040 --> 07:07.040]  george washington said government is not reason it is not eloquence it is force like fire it is a
[07:07.040 --> 07:11.680]  dangerous servant and a fearful master america's government is no longer the servant of the people
[07:11.680 --> 07:16.480]  and the protector of our liberty but has become that fearful master we the people must understand
[07:16.480 --> 07:21.600]  the nature of this government gone awry if we are to be successful in saving our country america
[07:21.600 --> 07:25.920]  is being deliberately destroyed by a cabal of international gangsters so that she can be forced
[07:25.920 --> 07:30.480]  in the subjugation to a one-world government a god-given unalienable rights of the declaration
[07:30.480 --> 07:36.080]  of independence are in jeopardy we must not let them be stolen by ambitious and evil men utopia

[07:52.480 --> 08:04.560]  888-2134-338 again 888-2134-338 the genesis communications radio network proudly presents
[08:04.560 --> 08:16.240]  the alex jones show because there's a war on for your mind spending bills must originate in the
[08:16.240 --> 08:22.800]  house of representatives that's the constitution that's law if not you have a tyranny
[08:22.800 --> 08:33.680]  but the bill they're voting on is a senate version without a full review and vote in the house
[08:34.560 --> 08:39.520]  and so they're just going around to democrats saying do you agree to the changes without an
[08:39.520 --> 08:47.200]  official vote so none of them politically have to go on the line for this but there's another big
[08:47.200 --> 08:54.800]  issue here and that's why 38 and growing told us 39 but this morning it's 38 attorney generals
[08:55.520 --> 09:00.320]  i heard abbott on news radio 590 this morning the texas attorney general and he was explaining it
[09:00.320 --> 09:07.600]  in crystal clear terms that if the government can force you to buy something via the commerce
[09:07.600 --> 09:12.720]  clause which they've never before done you are a slave and they can make you go out and buy a
[09:12.720 --> 09:19.840]  electric car to quote prop up general motors they can just unilaterally seize your bank accounts
[09:20.640 --> 09:28.080]  they can do whatever they want and you know rush limbaugh yesterday said this was treason
[09:28.080 --> 09:32.560]  that this was a quote overthrow of the u.s constitution i have the quotes here that this
[09:32.560 --> 09:37.680]  was a rebellion against america this was illegal that these people are criminals and should be
[09:37.680 --> 09:45.920]  arrested i've never heard limbaugh talk like this but limbaugh where were you with the patriot act
[09:45.920 --> 09:49.360]  which they now admit is used in non-terror related cases against the american people
[09:49.920 --> 09:57.440]  where were you on torture where were you on our own military having the patriot act used against
[09:57.440 --> 10:04.320]  them where were you during the warrantless water tapping see you can't just violate one part of
[10:04.320 --> 10:09.040]  the constitution and bill of rights when you like it and then get mad when somebody else doesn't
[10:10.000 --> 10:14.880]  and that's my main issue that's the whole point of this radio show we have a lawless
[10:15.520 --> 10:20.240]  criminal corporate group that has bought off most of the state-level politicians
[10:20.240 --> 10:26.560]  and almost all of the feds those that they can't buy off die a mysterious plane accidents or their
[10:26.560 --> 10:36.080]  sexual transgressions with hookers or whatever are brought out the system destroys anyone at the
[10:36.080 --> 10:42.160]  highest level so people say well i might as well just get bought off then and i've got news reports
[10:42.160 --> 10:48.000]  where the majority of federal employees aren't even paying their taxes or all of their taxes and
[10:48.000 --> 10:54.640]  they're not enforced against and that dovetails with all over the country software license plate
[10:54.640 --> 11:01.520]  reading cameras the police and bureaucrats federal and state are exempt over a million license plates
[11:01.520 --> 11:06.960]  are exempt the scanners cannot even read them there's a default block in california it was over
[11:06.960 --> 11:12.800]  a million two years ago i don't know what it is now it's always growing and if a bureaucrat
[11:12.800 --> 11:18.320]  doesn't like you they just put you in a database and you can't have a job you can't fly you can't
[11:18.320 --> 11:23.440]  do anything and that's in this bill you don't get insurance no job the irs takes your paycheck takes
[11:23.440 --> 11:28.160]  your tax refund because the news is reporting oh they can take your tax refund and keep it
[11:29.520 --> 11:33.520]  but i read the bill it actually says they can do whatever they want no judge no jury they just
[11:33.520 --> 11:42.320]  grab your account and that dovetails with erin dyke and rob dubb uh on the east coast they
[11:42.320 --> 11:52.480]  went to interview lord mongton for an upcoming film the next fall the republic and the tsa came
[11:52.480 --> 12:00.000]  over to them and said what are you doing with these cameras and got in their face and said
[12:02.000 --> 12:07.840]  i can make sure you never get to travel again never get to fly nothing and was just on an
[12:07.840 --> 12:13.840]  incredible power trip that's not see germany well first they said certain groups and couldn't they
[12:13.840 --> 12:20.240]  always pick an unpopular minority to test it out on muslims cave dwellers supposedly from afghanistan
[12:20.240 --> 12:27.360]  but the real targeting is against the general public in nazi germany it was communist jews
[12:27.920 --> 12:34.880]  seventh day adventist first you couldn't have your business then you had to move out of your home
[12:34.880 --> 12:40.160]  for your safety you weren't allowed to work you weren't allowed to travel you had to have a special
[12:40.160 --> 12:45.360]  identification marking you as that and that's exactly what this is now this tsa people just
[12:45.360 --> 12:54.320]  walked up and said look buddy you'll never travel again and started laughing but erin really stood
[12:54.320 --> 12:59.440]  up to him started rolling the camera when the guy did this so he put together a youtube video of
[12:59.440 --> 13:03.840]  that and erin has a lot of courage you know i don't even tell him when they're flying to stand up
[13:03.840 --> 13:07.600]  against these people i tell them you know it's your own personal decision but he stood up against
[13:07.600 --> 13:12.880]  the irs commissioner and geithner and got that go to hell look then they sick their goons on them
[13:12.880 --> 13:17.520]  afterwards to just go to a press conference and ask him a question about the 23 trillion
[13:17.520 --> 13:23.200]  erin used the old seven month old number from bloomberg of 23.7 trillion it was it was over
[13:23.200 --> 13:31.520]  28 trillion three months ago um these are thugs i mean this is what it's like to be a slave we're
[13:31.520 --> 13:41.920]  now learning this and it looks like they're going to get the bill through it they're going to have
[13:41.920 --> 13:48.160]  the democrats not vote on the bill itself but dissenting votes change their vote and deem
[13:50.000 --> 13:58.160]  never before done on a spending bill deeming can be done for oh yeah i support that october is
[13:59.520 --> 14:04.720]  in family violence month or yes i'll vote with you that uh
[14:04.720 --> 14:14.000]  uh you know november is iowa corn month i mean that i mean they literally have that if it's a
[14:14.000 --> 14:20.080]  non-binding resolution that's just a sense of the house a sense of the senate i mean this is truly
[14:20.080 --> 14:26.640]  illegal and even mercaferty on singing in said you know that it borders on unconstitutional
[14:26.640 --> 14:34.240]  and many law scholars are saying illegal no it's all illegal and this sets an amazing precedent
[14:37.280 --> 14:41.440]  now they said six months ago that it was unstoppable was going to pass and they said
[14:41.440 --> 14:49.520]  that four months ago and two months ago and all along they didn't have the votes they needed
[14:51.200 --> 14:55.200]  to pass this really draconian senate version it's even worse than the house
[14:55.200 --> 15:00.560]  and so now they're just going to save that it's legal for them to pass the senate version
[15:00.560 --> 15:06.000]  without originating in the house i mean it's it's just unspeakable and then they selectively enforce
[15:06.000 --> 15:14.880]  on states where certain states don't have to opt into all the rules and unions they get a only
[15:14.880 --> 15:20.080]  certain unions get to keep their quote cadillac health care which isn't cadillac at all you
[15:20.080 --> 15:27.680]  you certainly pay for it and then yeah you get no uh deductible i think i've got like a five
[15:27.680 --> 15:30.800]  thousand dollar deductible i've just got mediocre insurance but the point is
[15:32.880 --> 15:37.600]  that if i wanted to pay more and not have a deductible i paid for it i mean i made a deal
[15:37.600 --> 15:40.720]  with whoever i work for if i work for a union or a big company
[15:43.440 --> 15:47.200]  but i'm not allowed to do that and and what what this does is set the precedent
[15:47.200 --> 15:51.760]  for government to do whatever it wants but but the irs provision alone i mean obama promised
[15:51.760 --> 15:56.240]  you during the campaign this is one promise he's keeping he's broken every other promise
[15:56.240 --> 16:01.520]  i'll end torture i'll end secret arrest i won't have signing statements uh i'll give you five days
[16:01.520 --> 16:09.520]  to read the bills i won't hire lobbyist i'll get us out of iraq immediately on and on and on of
[16:09.520 --> 16:13.840]  course he was going to betray you look at all the big money supporting him and if he lost it
[16:13.840 --> 16:22.320]  it didn't matter the same big money on mccain but one promise he said is we're going to find you
[16:23.680 --> 16:27.760]  if you don't get insurance and now they're not just going to find you the the idea of a fine
[16:27.760 --> 16:34.000]  says there's some court or some due process uh uh they're going to have the irs that's building new
[16:35.040 --> 16:40.240]  command centers all over the country like warts popping up on the face of the nation
[16:40.240 --> 16:46.240]  and to now be involved in your paycheck every two weeks and to monitor you and to control
[16:46.240 --> 16:52.640]  your health care and to start taking your refunds and your tax money and slapping um
[16:54.160 --> 16:59.120]  leans on your bank accounts and see now they're trying to phase out cash and make businesses
[16:59.120 --> 17:02.640]  have instant transfer make you have a bank account to have a job so they can take it
[17:03.200 --> 17:08.400]  it's already like that in many areas of europe everything you do attract everything you do
[17:08.400 --> 17:13.040]  trace your medical records given to whoever wants them by the government you're blood
[17:13.040 --> 17:16.720]  taking at birth police taking blood at warrantless checkpoints everywhere
[17:18.880 --> 17:25.280]  and coming up bill automatically allows power company to regulate your home temperature ksl
[17:25.280 --> 17:31.200]  out of salt lake city and they don't even need a stinking bill in california or texas they just
[17:31.200 --> 17:35.680]  come put them on your house or business our business got one last year they don't ask
[17:35.680 --> 17:43.120]  and they openly are announcing we are going to control your power at first they said a few years
[17:43.120 --> 17:48.560]  ago oh if there's a power shortage in the peak time of the summer we might turn your thermostat
[17:48.560 --> 17:54.640]  you know from 75 up to 80 and now they just say no uh we're going to monitor you and charge you
[17:54.640 --> 17:59.680]  premiums for using too much energy and we may just turn it off because you are a prisoner
[17:59.680 --> 18:07.040]  there was that big report about studies of the us in england how pupils uh are surveilled and
[18:07.040 --> 18:15.200]  controlled just like someone in a medium security prison well of course prison planet prison planet
[18:15.200 --> 18:23.040]  technocracy a scientific technocratic elite what did isonhower warn you about hard to believe 50
[18:23.040 --> 18:35.280]  years ago 50 years ago and i he was for real somebody dropped a book or something and it
[18:35.280 --> 18:42.320]  made a pop noise if you watch the unedited tv farewell address and he jerks with fear just
[18:42.320 --> 18:46.880]  like oliver north somebody slams a door when he's testifying before congress and he ducks and jumps
[18:46.880 --> 18:57.120]  down because he knew they could kill him any minute for all the cocaine dealing he was up there
[18:57.120 --> 19:03.040]  taking the fall for the femacamp plans and the narcotics trafficking and kind of like g gordon
[19:03.040 --> 19:10.640]  liddy for nixon but still he jumps down you've ever seen that he i mean he's in a congressional
[19:10.640 --> 19:19.200]  hearing and the door slams and he he gets under the desk that's what isonhower did he whoa somebody
[19:19.200 --> 19:24.480]  oh i'm gonna warn you about a technocratic police state takeover and then he hears a slam door a

[24:26.560 --> 24:33.600]  house to the senate bill without bringing it into conference of course then it's because senate's on
[24:34.960 --> 24:42.400]  tuesday flipped his vote after talking about how the health care bill raised taxes and cut
[24:42.400 --> 24:47.840]  medicare and medicaid i mean he says supposedly a real socialist and so he said this is a ripoff
[24:47.840 --> 24:54.000]  to the insurance company and banks and it's also criminal and unconstitutional and the
[24:54.000 --> 24:59.440]  insurance companies wrote it but had their minions out saying that they were against it
[24:59.440 --> 25:04.880]  even the wall street journal has reported on that and so there is one more person
[25:05.760 --> 25:12.480]  shuler undecided on health care bill representative shuler the leaders in the house
[25:12.480 --> 25:16.480]  representatives make their final push towards a possible vote on the health care overhaul
[25:17.040 --> 25:19.280]  bill this weekend the 11th district representative
[25:19.280 --> 25:27.440]  heath shuler has yet to declare whether he's on board so it's important to contact
[25:30.480 --> 25:31.920]  that individual
[25:35.440 --> 25:40.560]  there's another reporter out of the ap corn husker out more deals in health care bill give
[25:40.560 --> 25:47.280]  special treatment we're going to break more of that down coming up but i wanted to mention this
[25:47.280 --> 25:55.120]  this failed banks may get pension fund backing as fdic seeks more funds
[25:56.960 --> 26:02.560]  this is out of business week and they changed the law six years ago where companies can take
[26:02.560 --> 26:07.280]  your pension funds well now it's to be given to the foreign banks that is coming up in fact guys
[26:07.280 --> 26:10.960]  will you print me a printer friendly because this one cut off part of the article thank you
[26:10.960 --> 26:18.400]  you and i want to be able to cover that coming back but right now let's go to the mercaferty
[26:18.400 --> 26:27.440]  file uh with wolf blitzer i guess a uh blind hog does occasionally find acres broken clocks
[26:27.440 --> 26:34.240]  are right twice a day he comes out and says it's beyond sleazy not having a full vote here it is
[26:34.240 --> 26:41.680]  they're right the jack cafferty for the cafferty file just when you think you've seen it all in
[26:41.680 --> 26:47.840]  washington along comes something like this house speaker nancy polosi may try to pass the controversial
[26:47.840 --> 26:54.160]  health care reform bill without making members vote on it simply unbelievable polosi says she
[26:54.160 --> 26:59.760]  might use a procedural tactic where the house will vote on the package of fixes to the senate bill
[26:59.760 --> 27:05.600]  and then that vote would signify that lawmakers quote deem the health care bill to be passed
[27:06.240 --> 27:11.520]  politically speaking this is beyond sleazy it's meant to protect house democrats were all running
[27:11.520 --> 27:17.040]  for reelection in november from having to make a tough vote up or down on health care reform
[27:17.040 --> 27:22.800]  polosi says of this process quote i like it because people don't have to vote on the senate bill
[27:22.800 --> 27:29.120]  unquote in nancy polosi's world accountability is a dirty word the senate bill of course contains
[27:29.120 --> 27:34.400]  many provisions that are unpopular among some house democrats including language on abortion
[27:34.400 --> 27:40.320]  funding and taxes on high cost so-called catalac insurance plans this tactic has been used in
[27:40.320 --> 27:47.360]  the past but never never for something as big and important as the 900 billion dollar health care
[27:47.360 --> 27:52.800]  reform bill never republicans are jumping all over this rightfully so they're painting it as a way
[27:52.800 --> 27:58.480]  for democrats to avoid taking responsibility which is exactly what it is some even suggests it's
[27:58.480 --> 28:04.400]  unconstitutional meanwhile president obama's campaigning relentlessly calling on lawmakers to
[28:04.400 --> 28:11.280]  pass health care reform quote i want some courage i want us to do the right thing unquote well the
[28:11.280 --> 28:16.240]  irony here is that if nancy polosi gets away it won't take much courage at all on the part of
[28:16.240 --> 28:21.840]  our so-called representatives will it here's the question should nancy polosi be allowed to push
[28:21.840 --> 28:28.640]  health care reform through the house without a vote go to cnn.com slash cavity file post comment
[28:28.640 --> 28:35.040]  on my blog both we're learning a lot about reconciliation about deeming bills passed into
[28:35.040 --> 28:39.440]  law we're we're getting a little civics lesson out there aren't we jack we're learning a lot more
[28:39.440 --> 28:44.800]  about lack of political guts yeah but but you and i know that's been around for a while right
[28:44.800 --> 28:51.280]  not quite in this this obnoxious form or noxious form this this reeks jack cafford are you telling
[28:51.280 --> 28:57.520]  it the way it is jack thank you well not quite uh he says maybe unconstitutional clearly is
[28:58.080 --> 29:02.240]  and you've got wolf going well it's been like that for a long time see yeah we've been spying

[29:28.880 --> 29:34.560]  and they don't care if obama has a lowest approval rating ever they don't care if congress does
[29:34.560 --> 29:40.160]  they are going for broke because they believe they have a military industrial complex in place
[29:40.160 --> 29:44.400]  that will protect them from the people and they're going in trying to block the people

[39:03.760 --> 39:09.520]  over their heads throwing them in vans putting them on ci aircraft and taking them to scores of
[39:09.520 --> 39:15.280]  black sites all over europe the washington post came out in 2002 when they thought you were sold
[39:15.280 --> 39:19.680]  on the fear and said yeah we torture people's kids they have the cia section chief going yeah we
[39:19.680 --> 39:25.600]  we do stuff for their kids in front of them you got to get fake confessions to turn them to get
[39:25.600 --> 39:30.480]  people that will work for them to get people to go out and carry terror attacks they hold their
[39:30.480 --> 39:34.320]  families till they do it and they say after you stage the terror attack we're going to kill you
[39:34.320 --> 39:39.520]  but your family will live here's some video of your little girl now watch what we do
[39:39.520 --> 39:47.360]  do the ultimate darkness is now in control of the country the ultimate evil and it's in control
[39:47.360 --> 39:57.440]  of almost every other nation the ultimate evil not even the soviets under Stalin admitted
[39:57.440 --> 40:02.800]  that they tortured people and that they ordered people to sign confessions they just did it
[40:02.800 --> 40:11.440]  we have gone further than the nazis and so all of you police all of you military they're
[40:11.440 --> 40:14.480]  going to take your pension funds they're going to take everything you got when they're done with
[40:14.480 --> 40:21.280]  you you're their main enemy many you laughing right now a decade from now you will wish to
[40:21.280 --> 40:25.600]  god you'd have done something and then that's our chance to defeat it down the road
[40:27.200 --> 40:32.320]  because they plan on screwing every one of you that are serving them but you're such cowards
[40:32.320 --> 40:38.400]  you'll probably just go along with the thin you don't care it's like 1984 based on true things that
[40:38.400 --> 40:43.520]  Eric Blair aka George Arwell witnessed to remember the British secret police
[40:45.200 --> 40:52.000]  British intelligence worldwide communist infiltrator secret police in India you name it
[40:53.040 --> 41:00.000]  BBC top propagandist Winston Smith is his character at the ministry of truth from the BBC lying spinning
[41:00.000 --> 41:05.520]  deceiving when they arrest his neighbor who's the biggest servant of the government you can imagine
[41:05.520 --> 41:11.040]  and his kids are spies and tattling everybody in their apartment building they throw him in the
[41:11.040 --> 41:15.360]  cell with Winston he says I'm glad they arrested me I'm I don't know what I did but I'm sure it's
[41:15.360 --> 41:20.480]  bad I'm sure and he loved how they tortured him to death he thanked them and that's who you are
[41:20.480 --> 41:27.680]  cowardly filth I've studied sociology and it's not just Nazi Germany but all over the world
[41:27.680 --> 41:32.640]  I saw footage a month ago out of Nigeria where they would just grab people off the street line
[41:32.640 --> 41:37.120]  them up in the middle of the street and shoot them and they would get yellow people 50 yards away
[41:37.120 --> 41:41.680]  and say come here the people had a chance to run into the buildings and try to at least get away
[41:43.040 --> 41:50.000]  you gotta play that footage next week we weren't live on TV here it was on Al Jazeera BBC you name
[41:50.000 --> 41:54.000]  it if you want to pull it up just Nigerian executions you want to see it no judge no jury
[41:54.000 --> 41:59.920]  and there's just piles of dead bodies all out in the major city thoroughfare it's a
[42:01.360 --> 42:06.640]  four-way stop piles of dead bodies and they just wave them over they tell them flip over on your
[42:06.640 --> 42:13.680]  back because killers never want to look you in the eyes that's all part of their domination
[42:13.680 --> 42:18.800]  you flip over on your stomach and they walk over the naked 47 sprayed 10 rounds into their back
[42:18.800 --> 42:28.400]  and they say okay next and I always thought I was just run of the mill I always didn't think of
[42:28.400 --> 42:34.240]  myself as having courage I'll guarantee you I'm gonna fight back I'm gonna make a run for it
[42:36.720 --> 42:41.520]  I'm not gonna get marched into that pit and that's what that's the big ace in the hole
[42:41.520 --> 42:43.840]  the globalists know there's hundreds of millions of gun owners
[42:43.840 --> 42:49.920]  over 150 million 400 million guns and they know if one percent of you stand up you could defeat
[42:49.920 --> 42:56.800]  them all and that's the difference but they're counting on you just laying your guns down
[42:56.800 --> 43:02.240]  being marched into a pit shot in the back of the head it always happens everywhere else
[43:02.240 --> 43:05.760]  now we're trying to fix things peacefully and they're trying to short circuit us right now and get
[43:05.760 --> 43:12.400]  a violent revolution going that's not what we want but there will come a time for all of you
[43:12.400 --> 43:17.600]  when you just got a gut up and defend yourself don't go into the pits just don't go along with it
[43:17.600 --> 43:24.320]  okay that's my right as a free human being to say I'm not going down without standing up
[43:30.400 --> 43:35.200]  they're gonna take everything we've got ladies and gentlemen and limbaugh saying it's high trees
[43:35.200 --> 43:39.520]  and it's the overthrow of the constitution it's illegal uh these people should be arrested
[43:39.520 --> 43:48.880]  wow limbaugh is genuinely upset I think he need a boy they're gonna really come after him now
[43:51.280 --> 43:54.320]  never heard him talk like this he's telling the truth but hey limbaugh
[43:54.320 --> 43:57.360]  where were you on the patriot act for us citizens where were you on north com
[43:57.920 --> 44:01.280]  where were you when bush did the bailout well you were against it beck was for it
[44:02.320 --> 44:06.800]  um I mean where were all you mainline conservatives you see if you let the
[44:06.800 --> 44:09.920]  republicans butcher the bill of rights it's only gonna get worse in the next administration
[44:09.920 --> 44:15.440]  and when republicans come in you watch it'll only get worse again until we vote out all the
[44:15.440 --> 44:22.960]  incumbents and there's a key political article about how Rand Paul in Kentucky running for the
[44:22.960 --> 44:27.920]  senate it's very hard for dark horses to get in there he is in some polls 10 points ahead most
[44:27.920 --> 44:34.320]  polls about six points some polls as low as three but an index of polls at six percent on average
[44:34.320 --> 44:40.320]  scientific against the big neocon funded republican and he's way above the democratic
[44:40.320 --> 44:44.720]  challenger he's going to win and that's why dick cheney and others are putting out letters against
[44:44.720 --> 44:51.600]  him right now so see it isn't just the kennedy seat getting voted out with brown
[44:53.200 --> 44:57.200]  perry wouldn't have won but he posed as a patriot above medina
[44:57.200 --> 45:07.760]  and it looks like rand paul is so clean that he's going to probably end up being the next
[45:07.760 --> 45:12.000]  senator from kentucky and they are scared to death because it's incumbents that are in trouble
[45:13.920 --> 45:20.880]  you kick out all these lindsay graham types all this scum you kick out people i mean that's why
[45:20.880 --> 45:25.440]  kissinich was good he never flip flopped he was anti-war anti-patriot act he admitted the health
[45:25.440 --> 45:33.200]  care bill was a ripoff and he is pure trash now he because he fully knew he is very intelligent
[45:33.200 --> 45:38.160]  he correctly identified it as a giant banking ripoff that takes control of our lives and gives
[45:38.160 --> 45:42.240]  liability protection to the insurance companies you're going to get less health care now
[45:44.400 --> 45:52.560]  it's a new tax he knew fully and flip flopped tuesday now ventura said global warming was real
[45:52.560 --> 45:56.800]  then got educated and said it was a fraud he's come a long way so yeah ventura has kind of been
[45:56.800 --> 46:01.600]  like well where was the tea parties 10 years ago now criticizing republicans for being for a police
[46:01.600 --> 46:08.000]  state but now being against it ventura is is in a process of waking up so yeah ventura is kind of
[46:08.000 --> 46:12.560]  like yeah when you give people health care but we need to get rid of both parties he just doesn't
[46:12.560 --> 46:16.320]  know the facts i guarantee if i had time with him he'd be against it that's the difference
[46:16.320 --> 46:25.360]  it's denise kasinich knows full well what is going on but you can't just tell ventura something
[46:25.360 --> 46:28.960]  over the phone you gotta be with him in a meeting at a hotel and then bring all the articles and
[46:28.960 --> 46:37.680]  show him the bill and show him and then he'll but at least he's real i mean i know him i know he's
[46:37.680 --> 46:44.880]  real denise kasinich was real but was taken up on the mountain by satan and offered the whole
[46:44.880 --> 46:50.480]  world up there 35 000 feet in the air that's up on a mountain notice the symbolism of that
[46:50.480 --> 46:55.840]  with barack obama and when he walked off that plane with that satisfied i'm slit in america's
[46:55.840 --> 46:59.440]  throat i'm gonna get control of their lives i'm gonna get to seize all their bank accounts
[46:59.440 --> 47:05.040]  i'm gonna expand the iris and every facet of their life they're taking over the internet right now
[47:05.040 --> 47:12.960]  that's all being announced when he walked off with that satisfied look i knew monday i said you
[47:12.960 --> 47:22.560]  watch kasinich rolled and he did he rolled over he makes me sick nothing makes me more sick than
[47:22.560 --> 47:28.080]  somebody that knows exactly what they're doing and doing it that's evil it's the consciousness
[47:28.080 --> 47:34.400]  of the evil it's it's the it's the oh it makes me sick
[47:34.400 --> 47:43.520]  and so you kick denise kasinich out you make sure oh he's gonna get all the corporate monies
[47:43.520 --> 47:49.360]  and get all obama support everything you make sure that little rat isn't in office coming up in a
[47:49.360 --> 47:56.240]  year and you make get up off your butts everybody and i'm talking to new listeners and find out
[47:56.240 --> 48:00.800]  who your representatives are at the state and federal level find out who your city council is
[48:00.800 --> 48:06.240]  find out what's going on because listen a prison is being set up around you let's go to this clip
[48:06.240 --> 48:12.880]  with the remote control thermostats oh but they say they whitewash it some people think it's not
[48:12.880 --> 48:20.800]  good here it is good evening a new energy conservation program that allows rocky mountain
[48:20.800 --> 48:26.880]  power to turn off your air conditioning compressor only needs the governor's signature to become law
[48:26.880 --> 48:32.160]  but some feel it's too much government in your home sarah dollop joins us with details sarah
[48:32.880 --> 48:38.480]  well keith and carol coolkeepers is already up and running in about 90 000 homes across the
[48:38.480 --> 48:44.080]  washouts front the difference with the new program is that instead of opting in choosing
[48:44.080 --> 48:51.520]  that you want to participate in the program you have to opt out on sweltering summer days in
[48:51.520 --> 48:57.920]  utah your comfort isn't the only thing being tested the power grid is two so walking mountain power
[48:57.920 --> 49:03.360]  introduced the coolkeeper system seven years ago it's one of those cases where if everybody does a
[49:03.360 --> 49:08.320]  little uh they can make a big difference it's fairly simple when demand gets too high your
[49:08.320 --> 49:14.800]  compressor can be turned off for 15 minutes every half hour rocky mountain power says it results in
[49:14.800 --> 49:19.600]  no more than a couple degree temperature difference 97 percent of the people who are on it like it
[49:19.600 --> 49:24.240]  so the company says it makes sense to enroll everyone along the washouts front with the
[49:24.240 --> 49:29.600]  provision that people can opt out completely or on certain days that's one of the reasons the
[49:29.600 --> 49:35.440]  utah office of consumer services chose to get behind senate bill 47 which awaits the governor's
[49:35.440 --> 49:41.520]  signature if rocky mountain power fully complies with the law then every impacted consumer should
[49:41.520 --> 49:46.640]  have plenty information about this before any change is made i spoke out very very much against
[49:46.640 --> 49:51.840]  the senator chris butters was one of several lawmakers to vote no for the bill which initially
[49:51.840 --> 49:57.440]  failed in the senate he worries the wording in the bill is too vague as far as the amount of time
[49:57.440 --> 50:03.120]  your compressor could be turned off and he believes it's too far-reaching i think it's right on the
[50:03.120 --> 50:09.200]  edge of uh of being absolutely terrible it's a government intrusion that shouldn't happen
[50:10.240 --> 50:15.200]  and rocky mountain power still has to put a detailed plan in writing all right that's enough
[50:15.200 --> 50:22.000]  father you would opt out the rest is up on prisonplanet.com on the edge this this isn't on the
[50:22.000 --> 50:30.400]  edge of the precipice is at the bottom of the canyon 10 000 feet below on the edge oh torturing

[50:47.360 --> 50:52.240]  that people opt into and everything is tracked what food they're eating what they do they send
[50:52.240 --> 50:59.360]  elder care it's your prison the government running everything and we're just a bunch of idiot children

[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:10.560]  they've changed a little bit of the wording but in essence it's the same thing i haven't even gone

[01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:30.160]  altar of almighty god eternal vigilance and resistance to every form of tyranny over the
[01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:43.680]  mind of man i pledge i commit myself you know i'm worldly we all are but i've lost a lot of my
[01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:51.040]  worldliness as i just get more and more real and i see more and more of my evil more and more of
[01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:56.800]  my corruption i would be seen by the average person as an extremely moral pious person focused
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:02:08.560]  dedicated but i'm i'm not and that's what scares me is that when i am in the presence of my creator
[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:16.160]  the creator i feel ashamed that's why i like callers telling me how great i am i'm not great okay
[01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:22.480]  i'm doing what i have to do i'm doing what's demanded i'm doing i can't control myself all
[01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:28.960]  i can do is stand against this and as americans as people worldwide we think we're wholesome we
[01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:35.360]  think we're good now we need to repent every day and admit that our greatest works are like dirty
[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:44.800]  rags they are i feel like a dirty rag but only in realizing i'm a dirty rag in the middle of
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:49.600]  this wonderful creation that i've been decking it that i haven't appreciated it that i'm worldly
[01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:54.800]  i try to be strong i try to be upright i try to be pure i try to be serious i try to be focused
[01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:02.720]  but in the final equation there's no time for me to joke around screw around nothing
[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:05.280]  nothing in my private life in everything
[01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:13.600]  i've got to go to the next level
[01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:18.960]  and god's been working with me to go to the next level
[01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:25.040]  let me tell you i've seen the devil intensify the darts he's throwing at me a thousand percent
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:27.760]  but that only
[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:32.240]  only purifies me even more
[01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:44.560]  and i the only fear i've got is that before i go i want to get that much closer up the mountain
[01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:53.120]  and i want to be strong and i know the position i'm in and it's embarrassing
[01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:58.480]  it's embarrassing that i am the number one fighter of the new world order there's no
[01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:02.960]  doubt anyway you slice it i'm getting on hardcore info and waking people up
[01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:11.120]  it's embarrassing because i know the mistakes i make i'm aware
[01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:16.320]  other responsibility i've got
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:27.520]  and i know in my heart and soul what i should be doing and i try to carry it out
[01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:35.120]  what makes me even sicker is i'm the best i'm the best we've got
[01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:44.960]  i'm the best there is hands down and i'm nothing and i see how good the evil ones are at evil

[01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:57.200]  shots each time they talk to you but it's a real real discussion that goes on tim i appreciate your
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:03.360]  call i um was pretty clear that i wanted to get into government health care and and let
[01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:08.240]  callers call in with their take on the fact that looks like it may pass they'll need one more
[01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:12.640]  vote to then deem that the senate version has passed the house without a full vote
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:21.200]  um but i guess i guess that's not going to happen huh no well and oh and oh you're on the air
[01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:29.360]  Alex showing sir um it's pretty sad to watch uh Barry Satoro lie to the american people
[01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:35.360]  today's is watching him at george mason university and just continuously lying and you know sucking
[01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:39.840]  up the public to believe in this false prophet known as mr. Satoro but it doesn't seem like
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:44.080]  anyone cares they're only worried about that's right everything about him is a lie his real name
[01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:52.480]  is Barry Satoro on record that's his real name uh and he lied about signing statements he lied
[01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:57.840]  about not hiring lobbyist he hired about the banker bailout he lies about everything except
[01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:00.960]  that he'd take your paycheck if you didn't have insurance that they're going ahead with that
[01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:05.200]  then they lied and said it doesn't cover illegal aliens that's in there they lied and said okay
[01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:13.280]  we won't take your check it's in the final bill just everything is alive this guy is 100% lies
[01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:19.120]  and and the people go well he's lying a bunch but i still like him okay okay
[01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:29.200]  in kansas to win march madness it's it's despicable to see this piece of this scum on tv just lie but
[01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:33.600]  my question to you is i don't know if you saw this report on the drudge report but already
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:40.960]  down in uh i think it was seattle uh the walgreens is denying uh medicaid new medicaid patients
[01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:49.520]  down in uh the pacific northwest also my question is about i saw idaho first state to
[01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:54.640]  try to sue the federal government do you think they should also for the state trying to sue uh
[01:11:54.640 --> 01:12:01.280]  the tyrannical socialist america state that we should put it's unconstitutional because
[01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:06.240]  barry sartoro is unconstitutionally fit to be president i think we all should call him
[01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:11.920]  president sartoro from now on and not baraki san obama i'm gonna keep praying for you alex you
[01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:18.080]  are the real deal thank you for waking me up in march with the obama deception and unplugging me
[01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:23.680]  from the matrix thank you so much sir god bless you i appreciate your call george in connecticut
[01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:31.600]  you're on the air thanks a lot uh why can't we just uh say make this this defeat if it is a defeat
[01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:36.320]  i hope that god it isn't but you let's face it at this point uh we can only uh think that that's
[01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:40.880]  the way it's going to go we are never defeated until we give up absolutely this is going to
[01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:45.520]  blow up in their face we're going to use this at the state level to get true patriots elected
[01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:49.440]  and it's going to be overturned and repealed and when the republican leadership in the next few
[01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:54.720]  years doesn't fully repeal it we must remove every one of those stinking criminals no what i'm
[01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:59.920]  getting at is maybe this is the greatest method we could use to finally defeat the entire federal
[01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:05.680]  tax bill because make people realize that not only they're trying to take away every every right you
[01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:10.640]  have through this this bill but but that the whole thing is illegal just to tax you in the beginning
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:15.040]  so when people realize how how uh destructive this whole thing is they're going to be going
[01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:20.080]  after the weakest people who supposedly they're helping with this tax bill they're going to
[01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:23.600]  take away their home their their the money that they have a little a little bit of money they
[01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:28.960]  have in their bank account the ira's or everything they can take away they're going to take away
[01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:33.840]  and the people if they supposedly are helping with this bill is not but if we can use the irs
[01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:40.000]  the whole irs structure is illegal make people realize that that the whole thing caves in on
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:44.880]  they piss people off so badly that maybe they'll finally wake up but maybe we take this down the
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:50.880]  whole uh tax system it the way they're doing this excellent point george let me elaborate on that
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:59.120]  appreciate the call we didn't have an income tax it's in the communist manifesto until 1913 when
[01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:02.560]  the private fellow reserve took over same year they got it rammed through and by the way it was
[01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:08.080]  not properly ratified that's been proven by the state attorney generals a bunch of the states
[01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:12.400]  they said that ratified it didn't that's been proven then the tax wasn't applied to the general
[01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:18.960]  public till the early fifties it had been less than one percent before that it's about control
[01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:26.960]  and so we built this nation and had on average 10 growth rates every year until 1913 now we have
[01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:32.720]  what two three percent a year or less and that's cook numbers there's hundreds of constitutional
[01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:37.120]  taxes and they've got all those in and they're bringing in when i say hundreds fines fees things
[01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:44.160]  tacked on hundreds of new taxes that are unconstitutional and yes it's so criminal through
[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:48.640]  the commerce clause which that has no authority to say you will buy health insurance and we will
[01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:54.480]  take your paycheck we will take your tax refund no judge no jury no nothing i mean a cop can't
[01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:58.640]  pull you over and just take your wallet because they feel like it and the IRS can't just show up
[01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:09.600]  and take something from me just because they feel like it no due process
[01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:15.360]  and it goes on and on and on in fact let me just read to you here this is out of the hill
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:19.600]  newspaper republicans the sale irs provision in health care bill
[01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:30.880]  and quoting from the bill the bill will allow the irs to confiscate refunds if there are penalties
[01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:35.120]  for not buying health care and i actually read the subsection it just says they can whatever
[01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:42.720]  powers they want including seizing bank accounts garnishing wages lawmakers of question where the
[01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:47.120]  irs can handle the increased workload to oversee administer and collect penalties from people
[01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:50.800]  who don't buy health care insurance see they didn't ask a few years ago about the real id act
[01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:56.000]  federalized local ids whether it was constitutional to have a national id card under international
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:00.400]  treaty it's really international they said oh can we administer it so see the article
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:09.440]  diverts off and distracts off into oh can we handle this of course the irs can handle grabbing
[01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:15.920]  your money they love it this is an increased tax liability and tax securities representative
[01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:22.160]  peter roscum ranking member dav camp said many americans have already rejected the call for
[01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:27.120]  health care reform from other reasons and the expansion of the irs should only add to the kill
[01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:31.920]  the bill meanwhile i'm reading from a transcript of russia limbaugh yesterday
[01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:38.000]  this is an overthrow of the u.s constitutional system orchestrated from the white house through
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:42.640]  the house representatives nancy polosian harry reid that's what's going on here he went on to say
[01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:51.360]  it's criminal well it is criminal but limbaugh so was the patriot act section 802 written for
[01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:58.720]  the american people for all misdemeanors so is torture so is north com but you'll stand there
[01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:04.960]  with an american flag over your shoulder and it's supposedly all okay no you help do this limbaugh
[01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:14.960]  you butcher any of the bill rights they set the present to butcher at all and they will
[01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:20.960]  you let tyrants get away with it they will take you all the way down maybe like if they
[01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:26.080]  legalized for a month bank robbery every bank in the country be robbed every day the banks would
[01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:30.800]  shut down the country would collapse just like mexico just like north korea you let corrupt
[01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:36.320]  come in they take over rob everybody to everybody's slaves and the only way these systems work
[01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:41.600]  is in to make you like barn animals most people in north korea live in camps and one week out of
[01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:47.520]  the year they medically monitor you they stick you in a pen with a woman like your chicken in a
[01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:51.280]  rooster and they take your baby at birth and ship it to another part of the country and they're
[01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:57.680]  raising slave pens that's on record the only way slavery works is a hundred percent and so they
[01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:04.000]  got to go for a hundred percent and our own government says they want to break up the family
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:07.440]  they want to brainwash everybody they want to drug everyone and they've they've already gotten a
[01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:13.760]  long way towards it look tyrants are the same the world over and now we're in the 21st century
[01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:21.840]  2010 2010 and all the technological systems are being used not to empower the species
[01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:31.120]  but to enslave it and commit it imprison it damn all of us to a nightmare system
[01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:41.200]  oh and obama doesn't care if his approval ratings fall even lower and congress has the
[01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:45.600]  lowest ever according to gallup they don't care they're a military operation they don't care if
[01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:51.440]  their enemy doesn't like them and then they'll fool you or the republican a new enemy general
[01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:55.280]  in a few years and oh and you'll figure out they're scamming and they'll put in a new enemy
[01:18:55.280 --> 01:19:01.520]  general a democrat but see very quickly that illusions evaporating that's why republican
[01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:06.400]  and democratic incumbents are in trouble everywhere look at kentucky and the neocons are coming out
[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:16.960]  against rand paul but ap actually told the truth fact check premiums would rise under obama plan
[01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:22.320]  of course everybody's premiums and what the last caller mentioned about how this hits the poorest
[01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:28.080]  people i've seen masses of mainstream articles where in the last decade they've taken almost
[01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:33.280]  all the irs investigators off of billionaires and big companies and fortune 500 and put them on to
[01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:39.680]  people who are blue collar not even middle class that's like a four cents bill in a car wash in
[01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:48.160]  um sacramento last week and they sent two armed agents yelling at the guy over four cents see so
[01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:52.960]  they're all busy getting four cents from you meanwhile all the big bankers are above the law
[01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:58.960]  this is the essence of tyranny unjust weights and measures and that's what this bill does it makes

[01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:04.400]  you know there is such a thing as insidious influence does it involve bribery
[01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:09.680]  and does it involve some sort of psychological domination of individuals
[01:34:09.680 --> 01:34:15.920]  but what does the new world order mean for countries like ours a new world order no world
[01:34:15.920 --> 01:34:22.240]  order that elevates one nation or group of people over another will succeed and to spray that out
[01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:28.160]  and use myself that we needed a new world order so it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then
[01:34:28.160 --> 01:34:34.720]  everyone else and i got news for you you're everyone else the whole concept of new world order is
[01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:40.400]  something else it really says that the state is god you take the roots of that organization
[01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:46.320]  and you find out that they created in all of the british defendants uh what they call roundtable
[01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:52.000]  groups then around those little roundtable groups they created front groups we're getting to two
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:57.760]  levels of government here one level of government where we have checks and balances and a higher
[01:34:57.760 --> 01:35:04.240]  level of cog government where the constitutional authorities are not allowed to go back then it
[01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:08.960]  wasn't politically wise to be aligned with what his party's right wing considered a shadow world
[01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:14.800]  government the new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities this is
[01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:21.040]  the third leg of the new world order that's why it's important the people running this country
[01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:36.000]  are determined to destroy it the people running this country are determined to destroy it
[01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:39.920]  they gave the Panama Canal that we built with the communist chinese
[01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:52.160]  washington times obama surrenders Gulf oil to Moscow the obama administration is poised to ban
[01:35:52.160 --> 01:35:58.320]  offshore drilling in an even wider area on the outer continental shelf until 2012 or beyond
[01:35:58.320 --> 01:36:03.520]  meanwhile russia is making a bull strategic leap to begin drilling for oil in the Gulf of Mexico
[01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:07.840]  while the united states attempts to shift gears the alternative fuels to battle the purported
[01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:14.960]  eagles of carbon emissions russia will enact oil derricks will erect them off the Cuban coast
[01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:23.520]  there's one 644 square mile area right off the coast of Louisiana discovered in the 70s that
[01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:33.200]  has more oil get ready for this than saudi arabia probably more than alaska we can have it but the
[01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:41.760]  chai comes and the cubans can mexico signed a deal what four years ago with the chinese to move
[01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:50.560]  into their areas but we can't have ours and so the corporations move offshore halliburton all of them
[01:36:53.680 --> 01:36:58.400]  halliburton helps give nuclear weapons parts and oil field equipment to iran oh but they're not
[01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:05.040]  traders if i say i don't want to attack iran i'm a trader or if i don't want to give Moscow our oil
[01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:12.960]  well that's evil but if i go on russian tv and speak out against the new world order and say we
[01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:19.040]  shouldn't have cyber security takeover they have neocons come out and say alex jones ruski agent
[01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:26.880]  this is how the idiocy works and hey the russians they're getting their people oil
[01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:34.080]  the russians pay their people to have children our government pays you not to and it's moving
[01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:39.360]  towards a one-child policy but i guess if the russians are against abortion i better be
[01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:48.720]  for it or then i'm a ruski right the new world order the people running this country are determined
[01:37:48.720 --> 01:37:57.200]  to destroy it now i'm gonna go through some news and then to zack jason jason mike and david
[01:37:57.200 --> 01:38:01.200]  that'll probably be it for calls this hour got some guests coming up you don't want to miss

[01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:26.560]  piece we just played the trailer for invisible empire where obama at the un a few months ago says
[01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:32.160]  no new world order will succeed that has any other nation above any other that means financially
[01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:38.240]  that's what the cfr the un of all said deindustrialize europe england canada the united states australia
[01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:46.000]  new zealand but also keep the third world low that's what the uh kopenhagen treaty said right at
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:51.520]  double not quite double right at double one point from doubling the taxes on the third world that's
[01:39:51.520 --> 01:39:58.960]  on us totally keeping them in the dark ages and lowering us close to their level that's why they
[01:39:58.960 --> 01:40:03.760]  want the open borders to drive down the wages so no one has a chance to escape so there's no tax
[01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:10.480]  haven as the organization of economic cooperative development big un receivership body says they
[01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:16.800]  want our taxes roughly at about 80 percent like frances that they say france is the model so as
[01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:21.920]  finland all your money is in bank accounts the government takes it out whenever they want everyone's
[01:40:21.920 --> 01:40:27.120]  phones are listened to the government rags about it they call it safety this is the model
[01:40:28.880 --> 01:40:34.800]  so i saw idiots commenting on the youtube channel with the trailer going well this sounds good but
[01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:40.720]  obama says a new world order no country being above another that means financially that's what
[01:40:40.720 --> 01:40:47.280]  kopenhagen is china india mexico and 100 plus other nations have to make no carbon cuts every
[01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:53.840]  industrialized country does so if you're a selected country to destroy the west industrial base
[01:40:53.840 --> 01:40:58.480]  you have to make no cuts if you're a third world country that's not developed massive cuts if you're
[01:40:58.480 --> 01:41:06.400]  a first world country massive cuts it's those middle tyranny engines mexico china and others that are
[01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:15.840]  just absolutely above the law and mexico is the cancer meant to bring down america totally collapsed
[01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:21.360]  totally enslaved people the police machine got anybody that protest total tyranny 19 000 murdered
[01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:27.760]  the last three years and growing americans being slaughtered everywhere all kept on the lowdown the
[01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:36.400]  dl and nobody can stand up in latin america because they're so poor and that's the tool they
[01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:39.920]  won't make you real poor and you go to the government for your health care and everything else
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:50.000]  now look at this article we've been telling you this for years from the government documents
[01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:54.720]  depending on saying they're going to target american bloggers disinfo they're going to attack us
[01:41:54.720 --> 01:41:58.160]  they're going to infiltrate our groups cast since he says they're going to carry out violence
[01:41:58.160 --> 01:42:04.240]  to radicalize our groups in the fed groups 9 11 truth groups anti global warming tax groups
[01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:09.280]  they list them all you are the enemy the pentagon report says that the british when i cover two
[01:42:09.280 --> 01:42:16.160]  days ago with alan watt says you're the enemy they're just getting you trained the troops being on
[01:42:16.160 --> 01:42:20.320]  the streets and the government controlling your thermostat and running your life pentagon seeks
[01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:26.960]  pentagon sees a threat from online muckrakers new york times for the list of enemies threatening
[01:42:26.960 --> 01:42:30.800]  the security of the united states the pentagon has added wiki leaks a tiny online source of
[01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:35.600]  information documents that governments corporations around the world prefer to keep secret the army
[01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:42.960]  report linked it as an enemy to be taken on and knocked off balance and who do we see getting
[01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:46.720]  banned in new zealand when they flipped on the censorship system a few weeks ago though people
[01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:50.800]  protested wiki leaks info wars dot com present planet dot com crypto
[01:42:53.200 --> 01:42:56.960]  and what did wiki leaks put out to be depending on so mad all all these secret reports about
[01:42:56.960 --> 01:43:01.760]  their spying on the american people they go to churches and spy on you everybody gets spied on
[01:43:01.760 --> 01:43:05.760]  pentagons everywhere they run the local environmental takeover in austin
[01:43:08.560 --> 01:43:14.320]  now but don't worry obama was going to have total unilateral control to shut the web down
[01:43:14.320 --> 01:43:18.240]  without congress but now it says he can appoint a board he appoints them
[01:43:18.240 --> 01:43:22.640]  and then they make a recommendation and then he makes the decision cyber security bill introduced
[01:43:22.640 --> 01:43:32.400]  in the senate writers it says one major change the bill is that the president would no longer
[01:43:32.400 --> 01:43:36.880]  have the power to shut down the internet unilaterally oh but would have to work with industry
[01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:40.560]  because they're the new government to draw up plans in the event of a national emergency
[01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:44.800]  but then the president makes the decision so it's the same thing
[01:43:47.440 --> 01:43:51.920]  here it is emergency internet control bill gets a rewrite cnet news it goes on to say
[01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:57.040]  it still does the same thing meanwhile uh england announced a year ago the naked body
[01:43:57.040 --> 01:44:01.680]  scanners and then i told you they would then say by the way everyone must do it first they put in
[01:44:01.680 --> 01:44:06.720]  a few get you trained it's only random then it's everybody then it's mobile trucks in england
[01:44:06.720 --> 01:44:14.320]  and the u.s. homeland security has announced and homeland security is driving around running around
[01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:18.080]  everywhere saying it's sports stadiums everywhere else and they and on the video they put out
[01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:21.680]  they show them interrogating a woman they say are you bringing a recording device in the concert
[01:44:21.680 --> 01:44:29.520]  see that's terrorism it's it's all dog training incremental well here it is herald dot net body

[01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:52.480]  about what happened to him just briefly we'll talk more about it sunday i forgot to tell him to get
[01:44:52.480 --> 01:44:58.080]  in here erin was flying back from interviewing lord montan in dc with rob do and then they set up
[01:44:58.080 --> 01:45:02.400]  like the media doesn't the news about 50 feet back to show the scanners and the guy ran over and said
[01:45:02.400 --> 01:45:08.400]  turn your cameras off or you will never fly again no judge no jury he's got
[01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:14.560]  erin stood up to him and said no and unfortunately erin was shooting without audio these are fancy
[01:45:14.560 --> 01:45:18.400]  cameras where you have to set the audio and but do got it from 50 feet away they're looking at it
[01:45:18.400 --> 01:45:23.680]  right now to see what they can do but the point is they ran over to him and just said look buddy
[01:45:23.680 --> 01:45:29.280]  you'll never you'll never travel again and under the new national id act with the health care and
[01:45:29.280 --> 01:45:33.920]  this all integrates together no buying no selling you won't have a job it'll be a felony for your
[01:45:33.920 --> 01:45:38.080]  boss if they hire you without that card but the illegals will all just be legalizing given it that's
[01:45:38.080 --> 01:45:45.520]  in the immigration bill so it doesn't stop that and they're going to control your thermostat your
[01:45:45.520 --> 01:45:49.040]  refrigerator it's all being announced everything controlled you're not in good stead they just
[01:45:49.040 --> 01:45:54.960]  turn everything off i mean this is a prison erin briefly before we go back to calls and
[01:45:54.960 --> 01:45:59.120]  in good job going interview lord moctin tell folks the name of the airport exactly what happened you
[01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:02.880]  you thought you had the audio you just checked the tape your audio was off but do is 50 feet away
[01:46:02.880 --> 01:46:07.520]  we'll see we can check the audio up he did get it tell folks what happened yeah we were at the
[01:46:07.520 --> 01:46:13.760]  baltimore bwi airport just outside of washington dc and by the way we've been through there before
[01:46:13.760 --> 01:46:19.600]  they put the body scanners in well before this underwear bomber incident this was never about
[01:46:19.600 --> 01:46:25.520]  the supposed terrorist i was watching a documentary about the 20s and the ira rebellion and as an
[01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:29.840]  act of submission they would make the irish men always strip naked in the town square it's just
[01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:35.840]  an act of i strip you down you know i shave you like shaving a dog it's like a cone of shame it's
[01:46:35.840 --> 01:46:40.400]  like look i'll record your genitals but go ahead it is yeah this is the same airport we refuse to
[01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:46.640]  go through the body scanners last time and i was told i read too much and and rob do also refused
[01:46:46.640 --> 01:46:52.320]  but this time we weren't randomly selected others were we were filming that and just trying to
[01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:57.360]  document the terrible unwarranted search of and they let all the media come in who love them and
[01:46:57.360 --> 01:47:02.240]  fell that you couldn't right right and they reserve the right to film genitals and naked bodies but
[01:47:02.240 --> 01:47:09.200]  we can't film them doing that so this very tall very overweight guy comes over obviously trying
[01:47:09.200 --> 01:47:14.400]  to intimidate us and he comes up to rob do first and begins to tell him he can't film until he
[01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:19.600]  notices i'm filming too and decides that i'm probably the bigger problem and he comes over
[01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:25.200]  to me and starts barking orders at me to stop filming and i i didn't call to him i didn't
[01:47:25.200 --> 01:47:29.600]  submit to his intimidation because i knew that's what he feeds on the fact that people don't stand
[01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:34.640]  up as the reason this stuff goes so far as it does and i told him plainly this is a violation of
[01:47:34.640 --> 01:47:41.200]  our rights you don't have a warrant you're harming this country and he very sarcastically uh-huh yeah
[01:47:41.200 --> 01:47:46.640]  sure i said hey it's wrong to film children's genitals it is wrong to single out ladies with
[01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:53.120]  makeup and yarn and knitting needles in their bags all the stuff i've seen over the years and he
[01:47:53.120 --> 01:47:57.600]  got threatened that i didn't immediately do what he said and he said i'm going to get the police
[01:47:57.600 --> 01:48:02.080]  over here right now and you won't be allowed to fly how do you like that you won't and that's not
[01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:06.320]  see germany first they couldn't have their own businesses then they had to move out of town
[01:48:06.320 --> 01:48:11.600]  and no judge no jury they're seeing a no gun buy list if you're on this list a no work list i saw
[01:48:11.600 --> 01:48:16.720]  ridge six years ago say it on c-span this will be total control yeah and this wasn't a bluff this
[01:48:16.720 --> 01:48:21.520]  wasn't a random thing there's millions of people on the no fly at the g20 we we we called the military

[01:48:33.920 --> 01:48:38.720]  these threats all over the they love it no this is total bondage but this you want an example of a

[01:49:15.520 --> 01:49:20.960]  believe if we wouldn't count it as intimidation and he walked away as soon as i told him i have a
[01:49:20.960 --> 01:49:25.840]  right to travel i told him firmly i wasn't mean i didn't yell but i told him i have a right to

[01:55:14.960 --> 01:55:19.040]  the straw it's going to break the camel's back in conjunction with the amnesty bill that they're
[01:55:19.040 --> 01:55:23.920]  trying to start working on next week is this going to be what yes people people don't see
[01:55:23.920 --> 01:55:30.160]  themselves in the role of leaders and so they don't like it but they lay there and take it and
[01:55:30.160 --> 01:55:35.520]  passively going along with something is the same thing as acceptance and they have to understand
[01:55:35.520 --> 01:55:39.680]  the government's going to continue to squeeze and bankrupt things then always pose with the savior
[01:55:39.680 --> 01:55:45.840]  we must get up we must get moving we have to make this be the camel straw the straw that breaks the

[01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:22.320]  that how the federal law trumps state law like the quote constitutional law experts say the movement
[01:56:22.320 --> 01:56:28.480]  is mostly symbolic because federal laws supersede those of the state no it doesn't it's unconstitutional
[01:56:28.480 --> 01:56:34.240]  you can't make people buy something and give your money to private companies it's slavery

[02:02:23.920 --> 02:02:30.160]  and that there's a tsunami heading here and it's going to hit you at 540 i said really i said i'm
[02:02:30.160 --> 02:02:36.880]  done i hurried to my car left my car through my clubs in i drove my hour and a half home down the
[02:02:36.880 --> 02:02:43.280]  dirt roads over the hill rushed home where my wife terry and my dog were with this tsunami coming
[02:02:43.280 --> 02:02:50.480]  got in the house grabbed my surfboard headed to the beach out there and waited alex and nothing
[02:02:50.480 --> 02:02:57.120]  happened yeah for those that don't know surfers love to go to the tsunamis everybody else is
[02:02:57.120 --> 02:03:02.400]  running the other way you're running towards it well hey it's a one in a lifetime to get a chance
[02:03:02.400 --> 02:03:11.360]  to surf a tsunami jesse ventured uh well maybe someday you'll get to surf a tsunami well just as
[02:03:11.360 --> 02:03:18.320]  long as it's not too big you know i was watching videos online of surfers surfing tsunamis i mean
[02:03:18.320 --> 02:03:23.280]  some of those things a hundred feet tall well you know laird hamilton is the greatest big wave
[02:03:23.280 --> 02:03:29.200]  surfer in the world and i read his book and i'll tell you one thing that's interesting laird said
[02:03:29.200 --> 02:03:36.000]  that when he ever does these tv shows and radio they always introduce him as fearless and laird
[02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:42.960]  said that's the equivalent of calling me an idiot he said every big wave i ride i experienced fear
[02:03:42.960 --> 02:03:49.120]  but he said i'm i'm a person who can take that fear and channel it into performance and there
[02:03:49.120 --> 02:03:54.560]  are people that are capable of doing that but i found it interesting when he said that that
[02:03:54.560 --> 02:04:00.720]  calling me fearless is like calling me an idiot absolutely it's fear that keeps us on our toes

[02:08:06.400 --> 02:08:20.400]  on the gcn radio network man let me tell you ventura is so recharged being with him in person
[02:08:20.400 --> 02:08:27.360]  i never met anybody that has as much energy it's not a put-on it's just a just a dynamism but he
[02:08:27.360 --> 02:08:31.760]  was still overshadowing everything before he went back to mexico for three months to recharge
[02:08:31.760 --> 02:08:36.640]  i can tell he was a little little a little more tired than normal but he is definitely back
[02:08:36.640 --> 02:08:43.280]  and blasting with both barrels full power he just gave me some very exciting news i heard about this
[02:08:43.280 --> 02:08:47.280]  a few weeks ago but was told not to talk about it uh from some of the folks involved with the show
[02:08:47.280 --> 02:08:53.040]  but jesse can now tell you because the emails the twitter's coming in are asking me is jesse
[02:08:53.040 --> 02:08:58.960]  ventura's top rated on true tv beat out all the news networks but fox out of the gates that's
[02:08:58.960 --> 02:09:06.000]  unheard of conspiracy theory jesse ventura uh is your show coming back to television and win
[02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:11.760]  yes it is they thought true tv with the grand let's give them credit because what they're doing shows
[02:09:11.760 --> 02:09:18.240]  a lot of courage uh true tv is re-upped for at least eight and possibly ten more shows
[02:09:18.800 --> 02:09:24.160]  we're we're starting to put things together now we will probably actually ramp up and begin
[02:09:24.160 --> 02:09:30.240]  beginning around june man that is exciting governor well they are kind of excited over it
[02:09:30.240 --> 02:09:37.120]  and my my son tyrell now will be a field producer he's gotten a a nice big boost in position because
[02:09:37.120 --> 02:09:43.360]  they like his work and so uh you know things are going full bore as soon as we choose uh june comes
[02:09:43.360 --> 02:09:49.600]  probably and a lot of people are emailing asking will uh mr jones be involved well you know alex
[02:09:49.600 --> 02:09:55.360]  you're such a fountain of information i don't think that there's any way on eight to ten conspiracies
[02:09:55.360 --> 02:10:01.840]  that you wouldn't have some great knowledge or nowhere to send us places to get knowledge so i'm
[02:10:01.840 --> 02:10:08.880]  certain that guy that you'll have a role in the in the in the second season man you're a sweetheart
[02:10:08.880 --> 02:10:14.960]  governor ventura uh now you were telling me all fair you guys have got it what paired down to about
[02:10:14.960 --> 02:10:22.240]  20 but they're talking about 8 10 12 episodes they said eight for sure and possibly 10 possibly 10
[02:10:22.880 --> 02:10:27.360]  any sneak peeks on some of the things that are in the hopper being looked at right now
[02:10:27.360 --> 02:10:33.600]  no alex i won't go that far because i hate to see though a battle will happen it always does
[02:10:33.600 --> 02:10:40.080]  between what what i want to do and what true tv wants to do but contrary to the democrats and
[02:10:40.080 --> 02:10:46.480]  republicans we will reach a compromise compromise in the show we'll go on the air but we'll we'll
[02:10:46.480 --> 02:10:52.800]  have to fight those battles yeah because i'm certain there'll be some and in light of that i would i
[02:10:52.800 --> 02:10:58.560]  would not want to say anything that will do because benefit doesn't come true it hurts my credibility
[02:10:58.560 --> 02:11:05.120]  absolutely certainly don't tip your hand uh people asked me they said how can mainstream
[02:11:05.120 --> 02:11:11.200]  television put on a truly objective program and i said i know governor ventura well he's a man of
[02:11:11.200 --> 02:11:16.880]  his word he is going to produce this truthfully and follow the facts wherever they lead and then
[02:11:16.880 --> 02:11:24.240]  it basically just won't air if it if he has to compromise and it came out and people were stunned
[02:11:24.240 --> 02:11:31.200]  this is trailblazing nothing like this has ever been on national television i mean i want listeners
[02:11:31.200 --> 02:11:38.240]  to realize this was a true first governor ventura how are you able to get something done that no one
[02:11:38.240 --> 02:11:43.760]  before it ever done well i guess you'd have to put that like this alex how was i able to defeat
[02:11:43.760 --> 02:11:48.240]  the democrats and republicans and become the governor of minnesota and only raised three
[02:11:48.240 --> 02:11:57.440]  hundred thousand dollars to do it perseverance smarts will it yeah it's just ideas and and passion
[02:11:57.440 --> 02:12:03.360]  in that and uh again now i can't really fully answer it because like i said when we first thought
[02:12:03.360 --> 02:12:08.960]  we could do this show i told my crew i had a gentleman's bet with them and i said you know
[02:12:08.960 --> 02:12:13.680]  we're gonna do all these and we'll all get paid but i said i believe at the 11th hour they're gonna
[02:12:13.680 --> 02:12:19.040]  pull the plug on this thing and it'll never see the light of day well i'm happy to say i lost that
[02:12:19.040 --> 02:12:25.440]  bet because as i said true tv showed great courage and they aired a mile and they didn't edit them
[02:12:25.440 --> 02:12:31.440]  and they did nothing because we uh we did a mile out in california and i sent them all to them and
[02:12:31.440 --> 02:12:36.800]  we got them ready to go and they got on board and did it and i just spoke to mark juris who's the
[02:12:36.800 --> 02:12:43.440]  head of true tv and this guy's beside himself so excited to do another eight to ten wow well
[02:12:43.440 --> 02:12:51.040]  yeah i mean they're number one hit show almost beating fox i mean you talk about royal flush here
[02:12:51.040 --> 02:12:55.440]  and and i talked to braver man when you were back in mexico hyping one of the last shows
[02:12:56.000 --> 02:13:01.200]  on air uh if those that don't know one of the fellows involved and he said alex you wouldn't
[02:13:01.200 --> 02:13:05.120]  believe the big stars that are contacting us and i went through some of the names because i know
[02:13:05.120 --> 02:13:10.720]  some of them and he goes wow yeah that's that's some of them but he said he described it as
[02:13:10.720 --> 02:13:15.440]  hollywood wants to keep it in the left right paradigm jesse ventura is shattering that left
[02:13:15.440 --> 02:13:20.560]  right paradigm the media calls questioning anything the government does a conspiracy theory that's
[02:13:20.560 --> 02:13:26.080]  outside that left right orthodoxy and that there's a war inside hollywood in the media
[02:13:26.080 --> 02:13:31.280]  where most of the big names we know and see even in news not just in entertainment know about the
[02:13:31.280 --> 02:13:36.320]  new world order know about eugenics know about population reduction know about what's happening
[02:13:36.320 --> 02:13:41.680]  and they don't want to be put in the left right box but braver man said there is big hollywood
[02:13:41.680 --> 02:13:49.280]  pressure from people like steven spielberg to keep it left right and and because as hollywood
[02:13:49.280 --> 02:13:54.640]  goes so goes the rest of the world and now they just can't put this label on people that are
[02:13:54.640 --> 02:13:58.400]  questioning the official story and who have government documents i mean every time you go on
[02:13:58.400 --> 02:14:02.880]  tv they say you're just a conspiracy theorist or you know you're making this up and you point out
[02:14:02.880 --> 02:14:08.240]  no i'm not i'm going off things like operation north woods i mean here's operation north woods
[02:14:09.280 --> 02:14:13.040]  the actual document right here and we got abc news u.s. government plan to
[02:14:13.040 --> 02:14:17.920]  terrorize and stage fake terror attacks what can you say about the huge paradigm shift that's
[02:14:17.920 --> 02:14:23.280]  happening and the type of feedback you're getting from hollywood well i haven't really been to hollywood
[02:14:23.280 --> 02:14:28.160]  as you said as i said alex i flew from mexico straight to new york and i'll go to i'll go to
[02:14:28.160 --> 02:14:34.320]  los angeles sunday and i'll be there through wednesday so uh you know i i probably get a
[02:14:34.320 --> 02:14:38.640]  better feel for it when i get out there and i really wouldn't want to speculate as i said i
[02:14:38.640 --> 02:14:44.400]  haven't had any contact is where i live in mexico i don't have a phone or any of that stuff so i
[02:14:44.400 --> 02:14:49.200]  really haven't spoken to anybody but alex you want to hear another good one that's a little
[02:14:49.200 --> 02:14:56.400]  you know off the subject for a second sure my book right now and i urge everybody there's three
[02:14:56.400 --> 02:15:04.640]  new books out this week i have mine dog the bounty hunters got one out and i don't care if dog beats
[02:15:04.640 --> 02:15:10.240]  me or not i kind of like dog he's kind of an interesting guy but here's the one we're beating
[02:15:10.240 --> 02:15:18.800]  the crap on a carol rose book no and that's the guy i want to beat i want this book to beat carol
[02:15:18.800 --> 02:15:24.800]  rose because carol rose book i haven't read it yet but a friend of mine read it and he told me that
[02:15:24.800 --> 02:15:32.240]  the book is trying to rewrite history oh yeah saying basically that saddam had wmd's and things uh
[02:15:32.240 --> 02:15:38.480]  you know you said you'd like to waterboard shaney what about rove you know i actually saw rove when
[02:15:38.480 --> 02:15:45.360]  i did the today's show matt lower introduced it right before i uh my segment that was standing there
[02:15:45.360 --> 02:15:50.960]  i just stood back and kept watching it but i will give rove one bit of credit he has lost a great
[02:15:50.960 --> 02:15:58.240]  deal of weight well i guess that is credit for him but he is such a wicked person well he sure
[02:15:58.240 --> 02:16:04.880]  wasn't to me he came almost running over to me to shake my hand so i don't know what that was all
[02:16:04.880 --> 02:16:11.440]  about well he knows you're a big political contender but as tyrell said uh you want to do the tv
[02:16:11.440 --> 02:16:15.360]  show and some more books but you're leaning towards riding off into the sunset i hope that's not the
[02:16:15.360 --> 02:16:22.320]  case well you know i i'll tell you what actually happened and and uh you can thank big wrestle
[02:16:22.320 --> 02:16:28.880]  for this in in my in my uh last book don't start the revolution without me you remember i wrote
[02:16:28.880 --> 02:16:34.800]  that last chapter is fiction yes you know i made the run for the president with robert kennedy
[02:16:34.800 --> 02:16:41.600]  jr and i get shot and all that stuff well i was going to end it right there i was going to die in
[02:16:41.600 --> 02:16:46.880]  the end of that book and i was never going to do anything public again i was going to destroy
[02:16:46.880 --> 02:16:52.240]  jessie venter i created him and i was going to destroy him then and then go on and you could
[02:16:52.240 --> 02:16:58.160]  thank dick wrestle because he taught me out of it and he only put me in a coma so obviously i've
[02:16:58.160 --> 02:17:05.280]  came back from the coma oh wait a minute are you starting to starting to maybe think about 2012
[02:17:05.280 --> 02:17:11.440]  them oh no no no no i just mean that it is still considered to be in the public no alex i i have
[02:17:11.440 --> 02:17:17.920]  no desire at this time to run for public office at all uh i i think that in many ways i can be as
[02:17:17.920 --> 02:17:22.880]  much or more effective in what i'm doing right now that's right you can go off and cogitate kind
[02:17:22.880 --> 02:17:27.360]  of in the mountains like a prophet and then occasionally come back to the wicked city and
[02:17:27.360 --> 02:17:32.960]  enlighten us well and then what's good about it alex is i can come up here and stir everything up
[02:17:32.960 --> 02:17:37.440]  and then all this stuff and then i can run back to mexico and leave you without the collateral
[02:17:37.440 --> 02:17:44.560]  damage you know i well i mean i probably shouldn't bring stuff up on air without asking you but i
[02:17:44.560 --> 02:17:48.480]  don't want to give you more work to do but may we ever see jessie venter sitting in the alex
[02:17:48.480 --> 02:17:55.040]  jones broadcast seat for me you know like i said you need a vacation so uh you know maybe if you
[02:17:55.040 --> 02:18:00.240]  want to take a vacation sometime i won't promise anything but if you want to take a vacation
[02:18:00.240 --> 02:18:05.360]  sometime i might sit there but the people who have to understand something it'll be different
[02:18:05.360 --> 02:18:11.120]  have or the knowledge that you have oh yes you do oh i don't you have a lot of different knowledge
[02:18:11.120 --> 02:18:16.160]  i don't have i have some knowledge you don't have well okay and together we'll make a hole i guess
[02:18:16.160 --> 02:18:22.400]  exactly are you kidding jessie i would that's such a great idea i hope you do it listen um
[02:18:23.440 --> 02:18:28.000]  so much is going on so much is happening i put the call out again for people to buy the book
[02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:33.120]  not just to beat carl rove your show being number one on true tv one of the top shows on cable for a
[02:18:33.120 --> 02:18:38.560]  new show show is unheard of um the fact that your books are best sellers that this one's a best seller
[02:18:38.560 --> 02:18:43.760]  i mean this is really the alternative media and alternative views starting to supplant the
[02:18:43.760 --> 02:18:48.320]  mainstream media uh the new numbers came out last month that now the alternative media together
[02:18:48.320 --> 02:18:54.320]  is bigger than the mainstream media so i think we see these dinosaurs really starting to realize
[02:18:54.320 --> 02:19:01.040]  that their time has ended well i'm not sure about that or maybe it's the fact that even better maybe
[02:19:01.040 --> 02:19:07.040]  this country is starting to wake up absolutely no maybe this country is starting to people are
[02:19:07.040 --> 02:19:13.360]  starting to get finally frustrated enough with the media that we have and and the status quo
[02:19:13.360 --> 02:19:19.360]  that's going on and has been for years and years that hopefully we're accomplishing that because
[02:19:19.360 --> 02:19:24.960]  you know one thing i don't agree with them totally but because of uh some of the people in it but
[02:19:24.960 --> 02:19:32.080]  i actually like the idea that that the tea party's out there stirring it up too absolutely we're
[02:19:32.080 --> 02:19:35.840]  going to break i want to come back and ask you that big question that dick russell brought up
[02:19:35.840 --> 02:19:39.920]  quite a bit all people he knows that have been killed who exposed this stuff and why you made
[02:19:39.920 --> 02:19:45.520]  the decision to be so bold because folks when i say this book is hardcore we'll go over some of the
[02:19:45.520 --> 02:19:50.560]  chapters later we'll also open the phones up and i've got a big list of handwritten questions i
[02:19:50.560 --> 02:19:58.320]  wrote up that i want to ask ventura all over the map like the word is he's already shot a video

[02:24:09.040 --> 02:24:17.200]  thank you for joining us governor we've seen massive demonization and censorship of 911 trade
[02:24:17.200 --> 02:24:22.640]  i've never seen such a blitz but now we have 1100 architects and engineers going public saying
[02:24:22.640 --> 02:24:28.000]  inside job the evidence is coming out it looks like we've got the establishment on the defense
[02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:35.120]  right now well you know alex that's a great lead in because you know usually we're on the defense
[02:24:35.120 --> 02:24:40.640]  and i think it's time we go on the offense what i'd like to do as you know the huffington post
[02:24:40.640 --> 02:24:46.320]  censored uh they are in the huffington had been on my case for about two years to contribute to the
[02:24:46.320 --> 02:24:52.720]  huffington post so i did my first article and then i followed it up with my second one and of course
[02:24:52.720 --> 02:24:58.080]  they censored it they had it on for an hour and then pulled it what i'd like to appeal to go on
[02:24:58.080 --> 02:25:04.640]  the offense to all your listeners email the huffington post and demand to know right jesse ventura
[02:25:04.640 --> 02:25:11.040]  was censored on on the huffington post and i really would like to appeal to all your listeners to do
[02:25:11.040 --> 02:25:18.320]  that let's go on the offense and stick it to them absolutely the huffington post requested that i
[02:25:18.320 --> 02:25:24.080]  write an article for him about a year ago we sent it to him they said make changes and i just said
[02:25:24.080 --> 02:25:29.680]  forget it you asked for this and and you were nice enough to write two articles for him and and they
[02:25:29.680 --> 02:25:35.760]  took the first one about government drug dealing but posted your 911 article about building seven
[02:25:35.760 --> 02:25:42.400]  for about an hour and then pulled it it's just amazing yeah and so you know again i know what
[02:25:42.400 --> 02:25:48.400]  your listeners are like out there they're very loyal to you alex and so send those emails to
[02:25:48.400 --> 02:25:53.760]  the huffington post and send a barrage of them imagine if they got a hundred thousand or more
[02:25:53.760 --> 02:25:59.840]  emails demanding no to know why jesse ventura was censored from the huffington post well i think more
[02:25:59.840 --> 02:26:04.880]  than that we need to vote by buying the book and not let them censor it and we also if you want to
[02:26:04.880 --> 02:26:09.360]  get serious go after their sponsors because they might just like the traffic from emails
[02:26:09.920 --> 02:26:14.400]  overall and and and think they're getting attention of it but i mean that's a good idea
[02:26:14.400 --> 02:26:19.920]  but there's got to be some other way to punish these people how about folks go get the article
[02:26:19.920 --> 02:26:24.320]  that we reposted at info wars dot com in fact print it for me so i have the title what was the
[02:26:24.320 --> 02:26:29.040]  title jesse people can find it all over the web and then that way we can email it out to all the
[02:26:29.040 --> 02:26:34.080]  media i think that's the best way to really protest this is to make sure that's in everybody's
[02:26:34.080 --> 02:26:40.800]  email inbox well it's on the top it says huffington post jesse ventura article two
[02:26:40.800 --> 02:26:47.440]  american and then parentheses american conspiracies and and the title is what really happened on
[02:26:47.440 --> 02:26:53.200]  september the 11th what really happened on the title what really happened on september 11th what
[02:26:53.200 --> 02:26:58.080]  really happened on september 11th jesse ventura search that find the article that was censored
[02:26:58.080 --> 02:27:02.240]  it's all over the web now and get it out to even more people but you know what jesse i think them
[02:27:02.240 --> 02:27:08.000]  censoring it only backfired on them well i'm hoping so right we can make it backfire on them i think
[02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:15.120]  so too and i'll tell you this i won't ever write for him again absolutely i mean they come to you
[02:27:15.120 --> 02:27:19.760]  and then they censor it getting back to what dick russell was saying two days ago he was you know
[02:27:19.760 --> 02:27:24.960]  for those that don't know a top jfk researcher several best-selling books he was talking about
[02:27:24.960 --> 02:27:29.120]  all these witnesses he would interview who they would then murder and we know how many people
[02:27:29.120 --> 02:27:34.720]  that the establishment is assassinated and you really are coming out bold now do you want to
[02:27:34.720 --> 02:27:41.200]  say on record that jesse ventura will never commit suicide yes i'll say on the record absolutely
[02:27:41.200 --> 02:27:49.600]  jesse ventura will never ever commit suicide and i second that i will never commit suicide
[02:27:50.240 --> 02:27:55.120]  i had the dc madam on air say that three months before they killed her and i had been talking
[02:27:55.120 --> 02:28:01.360]  for a month before they killed gary webb uh the pooled surprise winner on ci drug dealing that
[02:28:01.360 --> 02:28:05.280]  they've been breaking into his house and and he was getting ready to come on the show when his
[02:28:05.280 --> 02:28:10.720]  new book came out and they shot gunned him twice in the head and the police said jesse it's very
[02:28:10.720 --> 02:28:16.160]  normal to shoot yourself twice in the head as a train navy seal uh is that poppycock
[02:28:16.160 --> 02:28:26.080]  uh that's about the only answer i could give you alex is to burst out laughing
[02:28:26.880 --> 02:28:33.600]  it is ridiculous come on then you are the only way you can shoot yourself twice in the head is
[02:28:33.600 --> 02:28:42.080]  if you missed with the first one i know it's incredible they just think we're so stupid
[02:28:42.080 --> 02:28:49.280]  well you know alex that they that's how they survive is an apathetic public you know a public
[02:28:49.280 --> 02:28:54.080]  that doesn't want to be involved a public that doesn't want to pay attention and that's what's
[02:28:54.080 --> 02:28:59.680]  wrong with so much of america today everybody looks around in their little tiny world and they
[02:28:59.680 --> 02:29:05.440]  think well everywhere i see everything is good and as long as it doesn't upset what i can see
[02:29:05.440 --> 02:29:10.320]  i'm not going to get involved and the thing is in our country you should get involved
[02:29:10.320 --> 02:29:16.640]  if you don't get involved a bunch of crooks will take over that's right you know uh if you don't
[02:29:16.640 --> 02:29:21.840]  hold government's feet to the fire you will get bad government we're going to break long

[02:33:40.640 --> 02:33:48.160]  prison planet dot tv fda us food and drug administration recall fda dot gov see that folks
[02:33:48.160 --> 02:33:54.320]  they're recalling all the vaccine a month ago we had the head of the eu 47 nation member panel on
[02:33:54.320 --> 02:34:00.080]  a doctor saying it was dangerous and bad and hurting people governor you've been proven right
[02:34:00.080 --> 02:34:07.600]  again why did you instinctually come out against the flu shot well i just exactly what you said
[02:34:07.600 --> 02:34:14.640]  instinct i never got a flu shot i refuse to get that flu shot and uh i don't know i i i never
[02:34:14.640 --> 02:34:20.880]  catch the flu so why would i need a shot to prevent it now not saying i couldn't catch the flu i
[02:34:20.880 --> 02:34:26.080]  certainly i guess could but uh i don't know it just doesn't uh you know with all with all the
[02:34:26.080 --> 02:34:32.400]  bad stuff that they can stick in those things i don't need that stuff in my body absolutely um
[02:34:33.520 --> 02:34:38.880]  i want to get into the book in a moment but i've got a lot of questions that i wanted to raise uh to
[02:34:38.880 --> 02:34:47.360]  you uh getting back to the media attacks how they're bouncing off of you i mean you're being
[02:34:47.360 --> 02:34:55.920]  attacked by fox news radio other tv networks you go on these shows they try to criticize you and then
[02:34:55.920 --> 02:35:01.360]  you just completely take the air out of their sails laying out the facts it's it's it's almost
[02:35:01.360 --> 02:35:06.640]  like we're fighting paper tigers and we're beginning to see that these people aren't invincible well and
[02:35:06.640 --> 02:35:12.320]  the thing is most of them have never done any research other than sound by television and what
[02:35:12.320 --> 02:35:17.840]  the uh and what they send to them over a teleprompter you know to read a couple soundbites like a
[02:35:17.840 --> 02:35:24.560]  did you happen to catch me on the view it was incredibly powerful well the thing was i was
[02:35:24.560 --> 02:35:32.400]  amazed barbara walters was my main adversary and and i found that funny because she says to me
[02:35:32.400 --> 02:35:38.960]  governor you're telling me that would intentionally kill 3 000 people blah blah blah blah blah
[02:35:38.960 --> 02:35:46.080]  and i said barbara i'll give you another example the the gulf of conkinance it never happened
[02:35:46.080 --> 02:35:51.840]  they killed 58 000 of my generation in vietnam and who knows maybe a million vietnamese
[02:35:56.560 --> 02:36:01.760]  millo riley called you a pinhead last night i mean this is a guy with his pass i don't think
[02:36:01.760 --> 02:36:07.440]  really has any credibility what are you calling this is the second time now he's called me a pinhead
[02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:13.840]  yes he called me a pinhead for he played the clip from the view and uh basically called you a pinhead
[02:36:14.400 --> 02:36:20.080]  well you know i ran into a riley at fox and uh boy he sure doesn't do that to me when he's
[02:36:20.080 --> 02:36:25.760]  face to face with me because bill o'reilly's afraid to have me on his show because i i don't
[02:36:25.760 --> 02:36:30.640]  call us to him and i'll tell you i'll give you i'll give you listeners a good life from bill
[02:36:30.640 --> 02:36:37.360]  o'reilly he had uh uh ted turn around once and i don't know ted looked like he was really out of
[02:36:37.360 --> 02:36:43.120]  it when he was on there because he didn't seem sharp and o'reilly made the statement that the
[02:36:43.120 --> 02:36:51.920]  killing fields in tambodia were caused because we left vietnam too soon the first thing is we
[02:36:51.920 --> 02:36:58.400]  weren't at war technically in tambodia or laws we are at war in vietnam and the killing fields were
[02:36:58.400 --> 02:37:04.800]  caused because richard nixon and henry kissinger secretly carpet bombed the country into the
[02:37:04.800 --> 02:37:10.960]  stone age that's how come the camera was was able to come down and do that ethnic cleansing
[02:37:10.960 --> 02:37:17.360]  so you've got bill o'reilly all the time rewriting history and i confronted him with that in the
[02:37:17.360 --> 02:37:24.000]  in the fox lobby and he wouldn't say anything and i said o'reilly i first said to him when were you
[02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:30.800]  in vietnam and he couldn't you know of course he's never been in vietnam or if he was in vietnam it
[02:37:30.800 --> 02:37:36.560]  was probably recently you know he wasn't back in there when the war were going on so how would he
[02:37:36.560 --> 02:37:42.720]  know what the hell went on over there well zabigny brazinski who was running that uh as you know
[02:37:44.160 --> 02:37:49.280]  advising nixon and others he wrote a book two years ago bragging and people can pull the
[02:37:49.280 --> 02:37:55.280]  quotes up where he said we funded the chimera rouge against the communist and that the u.s
[02:37:55.280 --> 02:38:00.160]  government gave him four billion dollars so it was actually our criminal government that didn't
[02:38:00.160 --> 02:38:04.560]  just carpet bomb the government so that the chimera rouge could come in they financed the
[02:38:04.560 --> 02:38:10.560]  chimera rouge to do it yeah and i you know i'm not going to that spot have you read the book by
[02:38:10.560 --> 02:38:17.040]  colonel fletcher cloudy yes i have well isn't that interesting when he talks about what happened
[02:38:17.040 --> 02:38:24.160]  at the end of world war two with that meeting that took place between shankai shek uh starlin
[02:38:24.160 --> 02:38:30.320]  churchill and roosevelt where they literally laid out what was going to happen to war from that
[02:38:30.320 --> 02:38:36.480]  point on they said all wars after world war two would be fought in third world countries they would
[02:38:36.480 --> 02:38:43.040]  be fought with the military having no direct objective to achieve victory in the war now isn't
[02:38:43.040 --> 02:38:48.560]  that exactly what's happened since world war two with every war sense sure it's these phantom
[02:38:48.560 --> 02:38:54.720]  menace covert wars just meant to destabilize the third world so they can't ever industrially develop
[02:38:54.720 --> 02:38:58.160]  to threaten the west and that's actually in the british royal commission plan
[02:38:58.960 --> 02:39:06.080]  1949 yeah and you know it's just amazing to to read about cloudy's book and everything you said
[02:39:06.080 --> 02:39:11.280]  when you look at history has come to pass absolutely and he clearly put out the evidence
[02:39:11.280 --> 02:39:15.840]  that the military industrial complex killed kennedy man that's another example they can laugh at you
[02:39:15.840 --> 02:39:20.880]  and i call conspiracy theorists when we have all the facts but over 90 percent of americans now
[02:39:21.440 --> 02:39:26.720]  in major polls believe the government's lying about kennedy so again only that i saw that one i
[02:39:26.720 --> 02:39:32.640]  think it was a cbs supper of other poll where people said it's now a majority the people that
[02:39:32.640 --> 02:39:38.720]  don't believe the government's told us the truth about 9 11 exactly uh i saw an angus and read
[02:39:38.720 --> 02:39:45.280]  new york times poll four years ago in 2006 where 84 percent want a new investigation
[02:39:45.280 --> 02:39:51.680]  and believe they're being lied to so 84 percent of us are cooks 84 percent of us are bad look
[02:39:51.680 --> 02:39:55.600]  you did an episode on mind control and it's been declassified they do have these candidates
[02:39:55.600 --> 02:40:00.400]  they're always in psychiatric care and they always disappear for a few weeks or a few months
[02:40:01.200 --> 02:40:07.440]  this uh bedel guy has all the earmarks and the reason i predicted in the last three months that
[02:40:07.440 --> 02:40:12.080]  that they were going to have 9 11 truthers stayed some type of terror attack is there was no history
[02:40:12.080 --> 02:40:17.120]  of 9 11 truthers ever being violent are doing anything wrong you have the majority of the public
[02:40:17.120 --> 02:40:23.760]  waking up to this and i saw glenn beck bill o'reilly chris mathews and others with a talking
[02:40:23.760 --> 02:40:29.280]  point in the last three months saying 9 11 truth are going to stage terror attacks mark my words
[02:40:29.280 --> 02:40:34.800]  now how would they out of the blue just say this if they weren't prepping people and then you have
[02:40:34.800 --> 02:40:40.640]  bedel and the whole thing is very suspicious his parents warned him he was under psychiatric care
[02:40:40.640 --> 02:40:46.000]  he disappeared for months governor your take on uh what happened with the pentagon shooting well
[02:40:47.280 --> 02:40:52.960]  yeah that's exactly it and i thought i thought i was going crazy when because when that happened
[02:40:52.960 --> 02:40:59.040]  my first reaction was oh my god a manchurian candidate and then i had to like stop myself
[02:40:59.040 --> 02:41:06.480]  ago i must be getting in too deep into this stuff but lord behold i'd probably am not okay well
[02:41:06.480 --> 02:41:13.440]  here's an article you know alex i gotta ask you a question here sometimes this stuff gets so
[02:41:13.440 --> 02:41:19.840]  overwhelming to me that i really and i gotta tell you honestly there's certain times i start to
[02:41:19.840 --> 02:41:27.120]  question myself on this how do you stay away from falling into that syndrome well uh what you do is
[02:41:27.120 --> 02:41:32.480]  you just look at the evidence you analyze it and if it isn't a staged event the evidence will come
[02:41:32.480 --> 02:41:37.920]  out to that if it is a staged event you will see the earmarks i mean here's an example christmas
[02:41:37.920 --> 02:41:43.120]  day we'd forgotten eggs i was driving around looking for a place that was open my wife sent me
[02:41:43.120 --> 02:41:48.080]  out to get eggs and i'm listening to the radio and they announced there's been an underwear bombing
[02:41:48.080 --> 02:41:53.840]  on a flight from amsterdam to detroit i go in by the eggs come back out and they're already got shirt
[02:41:53.840 --> 02:42:00.320]  off on fox news radio who by the way makes a bunch of money off of it uh saying don't worry we just
[02:42:00.320 --> 02:42:05.280]  decided to put in naked body scanners though i knew he'd ordered them a year before when he'd still
[02:42:05.280 --> 02:42:12.240]  been in office the head of homeland security and then immediately several witnesses kurt haskel and
[02:42:12.240 --> 02:42:18.480]  others a lawyer said a sharp dressed man led the underwear bomber in amsterdam up through the body
[02:42:18.480 --> 02:42:23.680]  through the body scanners he didn't have to show id he didn't have to show passport argued with him
[02:42:23.680 --> 02:42:29.760]  basically had a security clearance got him on the plane without id so then i said this is a
[02:42:29.760 --> 02:42:34.480]  weekend to it i had haskel on i said okay you're interviewing for the show it's amazing his wife
[02:42:34.480 --> 02:42:39.600]  saw it other witnesses then the fbi showed up and basically threatened him called him a liar in the
[02:42:39.600 --> 02:42:44.880]  media then other witnesses came out about the sharp dressed man then haskel said once they were put
[02:42:44.880 --> 02:42:50.320]  into the customs the dog ran over and alerted to this other man who previously it looked like
[02:42:50.320 --> 02:42:55.920]  had been with the bomber and his bag had a bomb they said get out there's a bomb they arrested
[02:42:55.920 --> 02:43:01.920]  the guy the fbi lied and said we arrested no one then a month later they had to admit we did arrest
[02:43:01.920 --> 02:43:08.720]  somebody it's national security and here's the detroit news under secretary of the state department
[02:43:08.720 --> 02:43:15.760]  uh kennedy patrick f kennedy said that an unnamed us intelligence agency this is on screen right now
[02:43:15.760 --> 02:43:22.080]  true a terrorist suspect kept visa to avoid tipping off larger investigation and then when you read it
[02:43:22.080 --> 02:43:29.360]  it says they were ordered to let him get on the plane and waive his visa so boom same thing with
[02:43:29.360 --> 02:43:34.000]  the fort hood shooter they wanted to busting they were ordered for two years to leave him alone
[02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:41.040]  same thing with all of these events so once you know how they do it and and and once you see them
[02:43:41.040 --> 02:43:46.080]  really promote something and push it and and i don't want to waste i mean we want to hear from
[02:43:46.080 --> 02:43:51.920]  you said i mean ranting but it was the same story with the joe stack flying into the irs building
[02:43:51.920 --> 02:43:59.280]  all the same story jesse okay let's clean it up a little bit but i mean my point is i went on air
[02:43:59.280 --> 02:44:05.440]  air in the week after that happened and i said no it may just be a lone muslim nut but then in every
[02:44:05.440 --> 02:44:11.040]  case it's like the 911 hijackers i've had the head of the u.s embassy in jettison arabia on
[02:44:11.040 --> 02:44:15.920]  they were ordered even though they were on a terror list to let them in and the cia called
[02:44:15.920 --> 02:44:20.240]  and said they work for us this is part of national security that's on record too
[02:44:20.240 --> 02:44:30.400]  you how do you find all this stuff alex well i become completely obsessed and addicted to
[02:44:30.400 --> 02:44:36.320]  researching it and you know i saw springman that the head of the embassy in the toronto star
[02:44:36.320 --> 02:44:40.480]  the month after 911 i interviewed him then i've interviewed him many other times since then
[02:44:40.480 --> 02:44:44.400]  i had him on a month ago and he said clearly the underwear bomber is the same deal
[02:44:44.400 --> 02:44:52.000]  and he was the head of the embassy wow interesting stuff well but you know how criminals work
[02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:56.800]  though they do things in a pathological way meaning yeah over and over again so it's
[02:44:56.800 --> 02:45:03.120]  well and the other thing is too if it works one time it'll work again exactly i mean take north
[02:45:03.120 --> 02:45:08.560]  woods kennedy says no in 63 but then what do they do a year later at tonkin what do they do a few
[02:45:08.560 --> 02:45:12.960]  years later in 67 with the liberty i mean they do the same thing over and over again what is what is
[02:45:12.960 --> 02:45:18.000]  north woods right here in my hand folks what does operation north woods say they'll do they'll bomb
[02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:26.320]  dc bomb miami graze troops at us bases wound them grazing troops what did we see at the pentagon
[02:45:30.800 --> 02:45:38.480]  we exactly what you said and and and who sat at the feet of l.l. limitzer who set up the
[02:45:38.480 --> 02:45:46.080]  continue government plan under nixon but dick cheney and donald rumsfeld yeah well then i
[02:45:46.080 --> 02:45:52.000]  loved that thing in 92 when they were part of that think tank you know where they where they did
[02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:57.920]  that the submarine experiment or whatever it's rumsfeld were so rich cheney the whole thing and
[02:45:57.920 --> 02:46:02.960]  they get on and the question was how do we keep the united states the soul superpower
[02:46:03.520 --> 02:46:08.240]  now with the fall of the soviet union and they go through this litany of everything and then in
[02:46:08.240 --> 02:46:14.960]  the end it's got the summary to implement everything we've recommended will take many many many years
[02:46:14.960 --> 02:46:22.160]  unless a pearl harbour type of event were to occur and they said 3000 dead like pearl harbour
[02:46:22.160 --> 02:46:30.320]  what happened on 9 11 exactly oh it's incredible but but see that's the problem you hit on something
[02:46:30.320 --> 02:46:36.560]  key here most the so-called conspiracy theorist do just say everything's a conspiracy without
[02:46:36.560 --> 02:46:41.280]  evidence and so i'm a conspiracy you're a conspiracy ron paul's a conspiracy with no
[02:46:41.280 --> 02:46:46.480]  evidence ignoring the fruit of what we do but that's not really the public's fault if the
[02:46:46.480 --> 02:46:51.280]  government has been caught lying more than they tell the truth and there's a total loss of confidence
[02:46:51.280 --> 02:46:54.720]  then there's just going to be a loss of confidence in everything what do we do about that you know
[02:46:54.720 --> 02:47:00.640]  how i counter that alex i got that again today where they said are you a conspiracy theorist
[02:47:00.640 --> 02:47:07.120]  and i looked at two allen combs asked me that and i look back at him so allen the government's
[02:47:07.120 --> 02:47:13.680]  a conspiracy theorist too they've never proved anything i said look at all the murders that
[02:47:13.680 --> 02:47:19.600]  took place in the 60s nearly 70s are those assassinations martin luther king uh you know
[02:47:19.600 --> 02:47:26.960]  bobby kennedy jack kennedon there was never a trial for any of these guys notice how there's
[02:47:26.960 --> 02:47:33.760]  never a trial for any of these assassins that happen well we know under co until pro they got
[02:47:33.760 --> 02:47:40.240]  declassified in 77 that the fbi would stage events stage crimes and blame it on people we know obama's
[02:47:40.240 --> 02:47:46.240]  regulations are cast sunstein wrote a big policy paper saying infiltrate 911 truth and commit acts
[02:47:46.240 --> 02:47:51.920]  of violence so we can put them in jail yeah i couldn't believe when i read that about that guy from
[02:47:51.920 --> 02:47:58.240]  harvard that that wrote that paper saying that the 911 truthers know this stuff that they should be
[02:47:58.240 --> 02:48:05.920]  you know put under a surveillance and all this other stuff why because we question our government
[02:48:05.920 --> 02:48:13.040]  you know i i can't i have to sit and think that all the founding fathers of this country have
[02:48:13.040 --> 02:48:18.320]  got to be turned it over in their graves right now they are we're going to skip this break coming
[02:48:18.320 --> 02:48:22.800]  up with jessie venter will be with us into the next hour i want to start getting into the book
[02:48:22.800 --> 02:48:27.440]  here in just a moment chapter by chapter because believe me folks when i tell you you need to get
[02:48:27.440 --> 02:48:32.000]  this book when i was sent an advance copy i i didn't carry venter his last book because when i did
[02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:37.280]  call to get it it was sold out i got involved early because i want people to read this i mean this is
[02:48:37.280 --> 02:48:43.120]  just incredible information but let's bring up a few other issues we know secretary of defense
[02:48:43.120 --> 02:48:49.120]  cohen in 97 told the army times we have earthquake weapons we have weather weapons so do other
[02:48:49.120 --> 02:48:53.520]  governments a lot of that's been declassified the new white house science r says they are
[02:48:54.080 --> 02:48:57.680]  geoengineering the earth manipulating the weather right now that'd be a great episode
[02:48:57.680 --> 02:49:02.320]  because it's all pretty much admitted but but we could go deeper into it well we kind of did that
[02:49:02.320 --> 02:49:08.640]  with heart and that's where i'm going yep with the chili earthquake and with the and this is
[02:49:08.640 --> 02:49:16.320]  even on cnn and with the haiti earthquake they reported the sky had like an a rora borealis
[02:49:16.320 --> 02:49:21.360]  even during the day in the minutes before the earthquake and i'm not saying these were staged
[02:49:21.360 --> 02:49:26.720]  but if the government admits they have these systems i mean do we at least investigate it
[02:49:27.520 --> 02:49:32.400]  yeah it's very interesting they did that uh it was the same thing in indonesia too when they
[02:49:32.400 --> 02:49:38.640]  had the huge tsunami there there was no indication of it there was no earthquake before and i remember
[02:49:38.640 --> 02:49:44.720]  when i was doing my show of course alex not you but alex on the show who's always the cynic
[02:49:44.720 --> 02:49:50.080]  he said to me governor are you trying to say that they would intentionally kill all these people
[02:49:50.880 --> 02:49:56.880]  for no reason and i said alex i'm not saying that but i'm saying they could just be testing this
[02:49:56.880 --> 02:50:02.160]  thing out and maybe when they test it out this is the result what do you think they're going to
[02:50:02.160 --> 02:50:09.200]  come back then and say oops exactly some mathematicians we posted this on info wars in prison planet
[02:50:09.200 --> 02:50:15.520]  a few weeks ago have looked at the frequency of mega earthquakes these big earthquakes eight and above
[02:50:15.520 --> 02:50:21.920]  and it's mathematically getting very suspicious that they keep hitting right in population centers
[02:50:23.040 --> 02:50:28.480]  yeah that's what that is pretty interesting man but then again of course i'm playing the
[02:50:28.480 --> 02:50:33.600]  devil's advocate alex not necessarily big but you know we've always had earthquakes even before
[02:50:33.600 --> 02:50:40.400]  we had the technology so it may not be fair to attribute every earthquake to them oh no i totally
[02:50:40.400 --> 02:50:44.560]  agree with you i mean i think these are probably just natural but if the government admits they
[02:50:44.560 --> 02:50:50.240]  have this then you've got to start looking into it i mean we are in the 21st century you know what's
[02:50:50.240 --> 02:50:55.360]  interesting about a tool was that treaty that everybody signed years ago saying that they would
[02:50:55.360 --> 02:51:01.520]  not use if anyone developed the capability to control the weather that it could not be used
[02:51:01.520 --> 02:51:07.200]  in a situation of war or and all that but i suppose they view it as well or not at war
[02:51:09.040 --> 02:51:14.240]  well that's another great point that you just made and let's get into something that's a little
[02:51:14.240 --> 02:51:21.200]  bit more fun and not so hardcore but also interesting i heard months ago that you'd
[02:51:21.200 --> 02:51:25.920]  been involved in a secret film project we now know what it is what more can you tell us about
[02:51:25.920 --> 02:51:30.240]  your project with the wachowski brothers of course of matrix and v for vendetta fame
[02:51:32.560 --> 02:51:40.240]  i'll tell you what that was the most bizarre movie shoot i've ever been on in my life i have no
[02:51:40.240 --> 02:51:48.240]  idea what the end result of this movie will be i haven't got a clue and i and i'll tell you why
[02:51:48.240 --> 02:51:54.080]  these guys they're they're way out there but they're great people i'll tell you that but
[02:51:54.080 --> 02:52:00.880]  the these guys are on another level when it comes to creativity alex what they did to me here here
[02:52:00.880 --> 02:52:07.680]  was my role they brought me in and i spent an hour and a half what here's what i do know the movie
[02:52:07.680 --> 02:52:15.040]  will take place a hundred years in the future so i come in and they they do an hour and a half
[02:52:15.040 --> 02:52:23.120]  makeup job on me to where they put me in almost like a wetsuit type thing they gave me multi-colored
[02:52:23.120 --> 02:52:29.920]  dreadlocks all the way down to the middle of my back and my shoulders i get a big huge full man
[02:52:29.920 --> 02:52:35.680]  shoe type goatee beard with the beads in it and all that stuff and then they gave me in the center
[02:52:35.680 --> 02:52:45.120]  of my forehead almost it looked like almost a third eye right and here was my part i didn't
[02:52:45.120 --> 02:52:55.600]  have to memorize the line what uh uh uh a lot of a kowski uh sat across from me and simply
[02:52:55.600 --> 02:53:02.240]  all they wanted to do is ask me questions about how i felt about the war in iraq and the whole
[02:53:02.240 --> 02:53:10.240]  bush cheney thing and all of that stuff and they allowed me to just vent but the way i looked did
[02:53:10.240 --> 02:53:15.760]  you ever see john travolta when he what he looked like and it was a bomb of a movie but that thing
[02:53:15.760 --> 02:53:22.880]  battlefield earth oh yes i saw it that's about what i looked like even more bizarre and so i'm
[02:53:22.880 --> 02:53:31.520]  sitting there looking this bizarre talking about things that are a passion to me right now and just
[02:53:31.520 --> 02:53:39.040]  allowed to freewheel so i'm going to be fairly very interested i can't wait to see what in the
[02:53:39.040 --> 02:53:46.400]  hell this movie's about and i'll get us back to the huffington post for a moment uh ariana huffington
[02:53:46.400 --> 02:53:53.520]  was next and they had heard they had heard that doubt she looked like the queen of sheba or cleopatra
[02:53:53.520 --> 02:54:02.000]  and i assume they did the same thing with her now was there blue screen behind you or did they tell
[02:54:02.000 --> 02:54:07.760]  you anything else about well no i did it there wasn't any blue screen or everything but then they
[02:54:07.760 --> 02:54:13.760]  took me in another room and they did that modern technology where they have you face all different
[02:54:13.760 --> 02:54:20.080]  forward directions and do all that stuff with your body to where they can actually recreate you
[02:54:20.080 --> 02:54:26.080]  without you being there yeah so they're going to insert the virtual reality version of jessie
[02:54:26.080 --> 02:54:33.200]  ventura into whatever dreamscape they want exactly i can't wait for this film to come out because it
[02:54:33.200 --> 02:54:39.680]  was one of them it was the most bizarre shoot that i've ever been on in my life the only shoot
[02:54:39.680 --> 02:54:49.600]  that did it all compared to it was when i did that uh episode uh uh uh on the x files jose chung
[02:54:49.600 --> 02:54:54.960]  from outer space which i might add by all the x file crazy people that watch that shouldn't come
[02:54:54.960 --> 02:55:00.720]  crazy but all the you know the passion people that watch the x files and all that it made that one
[02:55:00.720 --> 02:55:07.760]  made it into i think the top ten x files of all time but this shoot was the x files was strange
[02:55:07.760 --> 02:55:13.520]  but this shoot would beat the x files by ten wow well it i mean you don't get bigger than the
[02:55:13.520 --> 02:55:19.840]  wachowski brothers right and so i mean hell you start alongside arnold swardson agar and running man
[02:55:19.840 --> 02:55:25.280]  and predator but but but now it's jesse ventura and a wachowski brothers movie do you have any
[02:55:25.280 --> 02:55:30.320]  idea when it's coming out no idea whatsoever like i said i don't even know what the whole script is
[02:55:30.320 --> 02:55:35.920]  i you know i went there i did what they asked me to do i was happy to do so it was a great experience
[02:55:35.920 --> 02:55:40.880]  that day they're super professional they're great people and i have great respect for them
[02:55:40.880 --> 02:55:50.320]  were they secretive about it uh yeah i'd say they were because you never saw a script they just
[02:55:50.320 --> 02:55:55.200]  told me what they wanted me to do they just here here they put me into the wardrobe they made me
[02:55:55.200 --> 02:56:02.000]  up look like like i said john provoked on battlefield earth almost and then they just i just sat there
[02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:07.680]  you know it was so funny alex because when i got into talking about it and i think i achieved
[02:56:07.680 --> 02:56:14.560]  what they want i completely forgot about what i looked like and i'm sure that's what they wanted
[02:56:14.560 --> 02:56:21.760]  out of it well certainly if it's criticizing the iraq war it's going to be powerful i guess it's
[02:56:21.760 --> 02:56:28.240]  probably going to be like android you know robotic humans a hundred years from now with some history
[02:56:28.240 --> 02:56:34.960]  of what happened in our times i would imagine alex that's exactly what it is basically it's it's them
[02:56:35.600 --> 02:56:42.720]  assessing and analyzing what happened now so it's going to be like a history of what happened
[02:56:42.720 --> 02:56:48.080]  in our times yeah only a hundred years from now it's strange people like what you'll see
[02:56:48.080 --> 02:56:52.480]  what i look like and it'll probably i'm just guessing we'll see if i'm right in a year or
[02:56:52.480 --> 02:56:57.760]  two whenever this comes out it will probably then morph into the future and then a fictional
[02:56:57.760 --> 02:57:04.160]  future kind of the wachowski brothers guessing what human development and merger with the machines
[02:57:04.160 --> 02:57:10.160]  like ray Kurzweil talks about happening could be your guess is as good as mine well we're
[02:57:10.160 --> 02:57:14.640]  going to find out as soon as this movie comes out and i guess you don't know what a tentative name
[02:57:14.640 --> 02:57:21.280]  is either nothing all i did it was a one-day shoot uh they did they did what they called a
[02:57:21.280 --> 02:57:27.760]  favorite nations contract that's where when you go who else oh they got salman rushdie too i didn't
[02:57:27.760 --> 02:57:32.880]  see him i saw i'm trying to recall the list of all the people they got but salman rushdie is going
[02:57:32.880 --> 02:57:39.760]  to be in it and uh and so uh that all i know and when i mean favorite nations that mean that's
[02:57:39.760 --> 02:57:46.800]  where they go out and if they hire about 10 stars to do cameos you all get the pay the same amount
[02:57:46.800 --> 02:57:52.160]  of money i mean they got a flat rate of money here it is if you want to do it and so but but
[02:57:52.160 --> 02:57:56.640]  there's no real negotiations or anything that go on that's what happened with scanner darkly
[02:57:56.640 --> 02:58:00.400]  that i was in i basically got paid the same thing as keanu reeves or woody heralds are
[02:58:00.400 --> 02:58:05.120]  went on a rider and it was the same thing in waking life rick link letter just said i want
[02:58:05.120 --> 02:58:10.160]  you to rant about the left right paradigm and i drove around for a few hours and that's basically
[02:58:10.160 --> 02:58:14.960]  was edited down into the film so that sounds sounds pretty exciting oh yeah no i'm i'm i'm
[02:58:14.960 --> 02:58:20.480]  going to be real interested to see this film incredible jesse we're going to come back we

[03:00:28.880 --> 03:00:34.880]  I tell you, Jesse Ventura, he is the real deal, and he said, I'm going to produce this
[03:00:34.880 --> 03:00:35.880]  show the way I want.
[03:00:35.880 --> 03:00:37.880]  I'm going to find out the truth.
[03:00:37.880 --> 03:00:43.080]  He believed global warming was real, found out it was a fraud, admitted he was wrong.
[03:00:43.080 --> 03:00:45.600]  He didn't really believe Manchurian candidates were real.
[03:00:45.600 --> 03:00:46.600]  When did the research?
[03:00:46.600 --> 03:00:47.600]  It was there.
[03:00:47.600 --> 03:00:54.200]  Hart, I mean, the global death plot, the global extermination plan, and now the show is picked
[03:00:54.200 --> 03:00:57.920]  back up, will be back on, I guess, in the next year or so, looking to start shooting
[03:00:57.920 --> 03:01:01.520]  again, coming up in the middle of the summer.
[03:01:01.520 --> 03:01:05.960]  We've only got this segment and one more with Jesse Ventura, and Jesse, let's walk
[03:01:05.960 --> 03:01:06.960]  through the book here.
[03:01:06.960 --> 03:01:11.040]  I'm going to get a document cam shot for prisonplanet.tv viewers.
[03:01:11.040 --> 03:01:15.400]  I don't want to say what is your favorite chapter, but what chapter do you think is
[03:01:15.400 --> 03:01:18.520]  the most hardcore or the most frightening?
[03:01:18.520 --> 03:01:27.880]  Hardcore is the most frightening one, to me, in our modern times, naturally, 9-11.
[03:01:27.880 --> 03:01:31.800]  Because that's what set the table for everything that's going on right now.
[03:01:31.800 --> 03:01:39.080]  Now, sir, in my lifetime, I think it was the assassination of Jack Kennedy, because I believe
[03:01:39.080 --> 03:01:44.440]  when they could take out our president, it gave them great courage to do anything they
[03:01:44.440 --> 03:01:45.440]  wanted.
[03:01:45.440 --> 03:01:47.920]  Take out our president and get away with it.
[03:01:47.920 --> 03:01:51.280]  That gave them great courage that if you could kill the president and get away with
[03:01:51.280 --> 03:01:54.120]  it, you could get away with anything.
[03:01:54.120 --> 03:02:00.040]  Absolutely, I mean, if they could kill him in plain view as a message to those that are
[03:02:00.040 --> 03:02:04.720]  informed that, hey, this is a dictatorship of the CIA, what do you think, well, you may
[03:02:04.720 --> 03:02:05.720]  not have seen it.
[03:02:05.720 --> 03:02:09.320]  About a month ago, Ron Paul gave a speech and said, there's been a coup in America,
[03:02:09.320 --> 03:02:12.240]  the CIA ships in the drugs, and they run America.
[03:02:12.240 --> 03:02:17.960]  Well, I don't know if they run America, but they damn sure do the drug business, because
[03:02:17.960 --> 03:02:22.600]  that's how they're able to do the clandestine things that they can do without having to
[03:02:22.600 --> 03:02:27.560]  report it to the Congress, see, the Congress allocates all the money, but if they can get
[03:02:27.560 --> 03:02:32.680]  money from an outside source, well, then they're not responsible to Congress, so then they
[03:02:32.680 --> 03:02:37.640]  become rogues or cowboys out there, and they can literally do any type of operation they
[03:02:37.640 --> 03:02:41.280]  want without clearing it with anything.
[03:02:41.280 --> 03:02:48.880]  Is this, what book are you most proud of?
[03:02:48.880 --> 03:02:56.640]  I'm most proud of, don't start the revolution without me, but excitement and interest-wise,
[03:02:56.640 --> 03:03:02.120]  I like this one the best, because this one is not about Jesse Ventura.
[03:03:02.120 --> 03:03:06.720]  My first three books were all about me, and so this is the first book I've done where
[03:03:06.720 --> 03:03:09.560]  I'm not the focus of the book.
[03:03:09.560 --> 03:03:15.280]  The focus of the book is the 14 conspiracies, so it's a new level of my writing now, along
[03:03:15.280 --> 03:03:20.560]  with Dick, of going to something that doesn't necessarily mean it's about Jesse Ventura,
[03:03:20.560 --> 03:03:23.240]  that it's about something else.
[03:03:23.240 --> 03:03:26.360]  And folks, you may think you know it all, but you'll learn something of this book.
[03:03:26.360 --> 03:03:30.320]  It's a great quick read, it's a thick book, but it goes very quickly.
[03:03:30.320 --> 03:03:33.560]  You get addicted to each chapter wanting more of the information.
[03:03:33.560 --> 03:03:38.360]  Buy the book, read it, then give it to a family or member or somebody at work.
[03:03:38.360 --> 03:03:42.360]  Wake somebody up, because the people are ready to be awakened now.
[03:03:42.360 --> 03:03:44.760]  Jesse, can you feel the awakening taking place?
[03:03:44.760 --> 03:03:51.000]  Well, yeah, I really am, and I can feel it in many, many ways, and I'll give you two
[03:03:51.000 --> 03:03:52.000]  easy ways.
[03:03:52.000 --> 03:03:58.960]  Every time I fly to Chicago here, I get recognized, and all the people at Illinois come up to
[03:03:58.960 --> 03:04:04.000]  me and say, hey, we need you to be our governor, because of course the last two governors, they've
[03:04:04.000 --> 03:04:09.880]  had Governor Ryan and the other guy, are going to jail, or they, you know, now I'm in New
[03:04:09.880 --> 03:04:10.880]  York.
[03:04:10.880 --> 03:04:15.720]  And if you can't believe all the New Yorkers in Manhattan begging me to move to New York
[03:04:15.720 --> 03:04:22.800]  and become their governor, what I feel happening right now, Alex, is a true grassroots movement
[03:04:22.800 --> 03:04:28.040]  of total disgust and untrust with our government, which hurts me.
[03:04:28.040 --> 03:04:34.520]  It really does, because I love this country, and to watch the people who are now, why should
[03:04:34.520 --> 03:04:41.640]  they be put in a position to where they can't have respect, and they can't have credibility,
[03:04:41.640 --> 03:04:44.640]  and they can't have trust in their elected officials.
[03:04:44.640 --> 03:04:45.640]  Governor, stay there.
[03:04:45.640 --> 03:04:49.400]  Let's come back and finish up with that thought, and then I'm going to ask you about the naked
[03:04:49.400 --> 03:04:50.880]  body scanners.
[03:04:50.880 --> 03:04:54.600]  Will you let them record your naked body, or that of your wife or children?
[03:04:54.600 --> 03:04:56.680]  All Americans have to ask that question.
[03:04:56.680 --> 03:05:01.800]  We'll be right back with Jesse Ventura.
[03:05:01.800 --> 03:05:08.480]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[03:05:08.480 --> 03:05:13.320]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[03:05:13.320 --> 03:05:22.240]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[03:05:22.240 --> 03:05:29.480]  They so pride in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit.
[03:05:29.480 --> 03:05:35.480]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[03:05:35.480 --> 03:05:40.440]  Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[03:05:40.440 --> 03:05:47.240]  We turned jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans, made in the USA with unparallel quality.
[03:05:47.240 --> 03:05:51.800]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you could
[03:05:51.800 --> 03:05:53.960]  ride all day with confidence.
[03:05:53.960 --> 03:05:56.880]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[03:05:56.880 --> 03:05:59.080]  Diamond gusset jeans got it.
[03:05:59.080 --> 03:06:02.800]  Others don't.
[03:06:02.800 --> 03:06:06.560]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:06:06.560 --> 03:06:09.720]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:06:09.720 --> 03:06:14.040]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans
[03:06:14.040 --> 03:06:15.040]  at home.
[03:06:15.040 --> 03:06:20.200]  We have tremendous influence on our president and Congress, and they really are calling the
[03:06:20.200 --> 03:06:21.200]  shots.
[03:06:21.200 --> 03:06:26.160]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:06:26.160 --> 03:06:31.480]  The fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal off-short cartel
[03:06:31.480 --> 03:06:36.160]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:06:36.160 --> 03:06:38.600]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[03:06:38.600 --> 03:06:42.560]  They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[03:06:42.560 --> 03:06:48.560]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[03:06:48.560 --> 03:06:49.560]  of the Republic.
[03:06:49.560 --> 03:06:54.840]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.
[03:06:54.840 --> 03:06:59.840]  We're watching online right now in super-high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[03:06:59.840 --> 03:07:05.240]  Remain in your houses.
[03:07:05.240 --> 03:07:11.080]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under executive order 11,004.
[03:07:11.080 --> 03:07:12.080]  Will they do it?
[03:07:12.080 --> 03:07:15.000]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[03:07:15.000 --> 03:07:20.600]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing
[03:07:20.600 --> 03:07:21.600]  day.
[03:07:21.600 --> 03:07:24.080]  Think it can happen here?
[03:07:24.080 --> 03:07:28.280]  Executive order 10,990 locks down all highways.
[03:07:28.280 --> 03:07:33.160]  Executive order 10,995 ceases control of all media outlets.
[03:07:33.160 --> 03:07:37.720]  Executive order 10,998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[03:07:37.720 --> 03:07:43.480]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[03:07:43.480 --> 03:07:47.620]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions
[03:07:47.620 --> 03:07:52.040]  about how to survive it, go to martiallawsurvival.com.
[03:07:52.040 --> 03:07:57.440]  Go to martiallawsurvival.com right now.
[03:07:57.440 --> 03:08:06.960]  You must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned.
[03:08:06.960 --> 03:08:07.960]  Big Brother.
[03:08:07.960 --> 03:08:09.960]  Mainstream media.
[03:08:09.960 --> 03:08:11.760]  Government cover-ups.
[03:08:11.760 --> 03:08:12.760]  You want answers?
[03:08:12.760 --> 03:08:14.920]  Well, so does he.
[03:08:14.920 --> 03:08:19.080]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[03:08:19.080 --> 03:08:23.880]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:08:23.880 --> 03:08:27.840]  Coming up for the balance of the hour, our government tour leaves us at the end of this
[03:08:27.840 --> 03:08:28.840]  segment.
[03:08:28.840 --> 03:08:34.120]  We've got a constitutional lawyer who got the policy change at the Denver County courthouse,
[03:08:34.120 --> 03:08:38.240]  where they were naked body scanning even children.
[03:08:38.240 --> 03:08:41.640]  Now Homeland Security, we played a video from Homeland Security two days ago here on
[03:08:41.640 --> 03:08:42.640]  air, if you missed it.
[03:08:42.640 --> 03:08:46.720]  It's in the archives at prisonplanet.tv, where they're going to have mobile naked
[03:08:46.720 --> 03:08:49.420]  body scanner trucks.
[03:08:49.420 --> 03:08:51.120]  And you can't make this up.
[03:08:51.120 --> 03:08:52.120]  Brain scanners.
[03:08:52.120 --> 03:08:53.800]  Here's French news agency.
[03:08:53.800 --> 03:08:56.080]  Brain scan can read people's thoughts.
[03:08:56.080 --> 03:08:57.660]  Total quackery, folks.
[03:08:57.660 --> 03:08:59.200]  And they ask you, are you a terrorist?
[03:08:59.200 --> 03:09:02.680]  When you go in a football stadium, you go in a rock concert.
[03:09:02.680 --> 03:09:04.800]  These are going to be everywhere.
[03:09:04.800 --> 03:09:08.240]  Governor Ventura, you're forced to fly a lot when you're shooting your top TV show, or
[03:09:08.240 --> 03:09:11.040]  when you're traveling and promoting books.
[03:09:11.040 --> 03:09:14.800]  What are you going to do when they try to force you through a naked body scanner?
[03:09:14.800 --> 03:09:18.240]  Well, first of all, Alex, I've been through one.
[03:09:18.240 --> 03:09:19.240]  Oh my gosh.
[03:09:19.240 --> 03:09:20.240]  No, wait a minute.
[03:09:20.240 --> 03:09:21.240]  Let me explain.
[03:09:21.240 --> 03:09:27.840]  I had my hip replaced a few years ago, a couple of years ago, so I've got carbon titanium
[03:09:27.840 --> 03:09:28.840]  steel.
[03:09:28.840 --> 03:09:29.840]  They did hip resurfacing.
[03:09:29.840 --> 03:09:33.720]  They covered the joint, and it would carbon titanium steel.
[03:09:33.720 --> 03:09:40.720]  So every time I go through an airport, Governor Jesse Ventura gets wandered and searched because
[03:09:40.720 --> 03:09:42.240]  I set the beepers off.
[03:09:42.240 --> 03:09:50.400]  Now, the way it happened to me was I was late for a flight out of Denver, and I wanted to
[03:09:50.400 --> 03:09:52.560]  get on the plane to get home.
[03:09:52.560 --> 03:09:57.200]  And they told me that if I went through that, I could make the plane faster because I wouldn't
[03:09:57.200 --> 03:10:02.960]  have to set a beeper off to where they could then have to sit there and wait to be wandered.
[03:10:02.960 --> 03:10:07.160]  So just simply to speed the process up, I went through one.
[03:10:07.160 --> 03:10:12.520]  But I think they're utterly absurd for the most part, but I mean, what are you going
[03:10:12.520 --> 03:10:16.320]  to do when you've got to get on a plane or use a plane if it's required to do it?
[03:10:16.320 --> 03:10:19.320]  I mean, what's going to happen to all of us then?
[03:10:19.320 --> 03:10:20.320]  I don't know.
[03:10:20.320 --> 03:10:24.600]  If it's mandatory, that if you're going to fly, you have to walk through one of these.
[03:10:24.600 --> 03:10:28.880]  So it did happen to me once, and you know, you've got to remember though, Alex, a naked
[03:10:28.880 --> 03:10:34.600]  body scanner truly doesn't bother a Navy SEAL bad because we never wear underwear anywhere
[03:10:34.600 --> 03:10:40.280]  and we use things like skivvy checks all the time, so being naked ain't no big deal.
[03:10:40.280 --> 03:10:45.000]  I understand that, but hurting our families through it, going through it to get into a
[03:10:45.000 --> 03:10:49.680]  ball game, this has clearly just meant to dominate us, to break our will, to make us
[03:10:49.680 --> 03:10:50.680]  submit.
[03:10:50.680 --> 03:10:54.600]  Well, yeah, and it's all about control, it's all about violating your rights.
[03:10:54.600 --> 03:10:58.480]  I mean, let's look at it now, they've shredded the Fourth Amendment, I read a book down in
[03:10:58.480 --> 03:11:03.960]  Mexico where every one of our emails and every one of our phone calls in this country
[03:11:03.960 --> 03:11:07.640]  can be, you know, go, have to pass through the government.
[03:11:07.640 --> 03:11:12.560]  Well that's another subject I wanted to raise, Wired Magazine headline, Cybersecurity, the
[03:11:12.560 --> 03:11:16.560]  end of the open Internet, and Cass Sunstein at the White House and others, they're saying
[03:11:16.560 --> 03:11:23.040]  they want fines, fees, taxes on quote, conspiracy theories, so taxes on ideas, or maybe it should
[03:11:23.040 --> 03:11:26.800]  be made illegal, and the Pentagon is openly taking the Internet over.
[03:11:26.800 --> 03:11:32.560]  Oh yeah, no, I knew that that would happen because, you know, because the Internet was
[03:11:32.560 --> 03:11:39.200]  the one thing they didn't ask control over for a while, and, you know, so they, I knew
[03:11:39.200 --> 03:11:44.200]  absolutely that they couldn't let some rogue thing out there because where do you get real
[03:11:44.200 --> 03:11:45.200]  information?
[03:11:45.200 --> 03:11:48.800]  Now let's be honest, there's a lot of BS on the Internet, you've got to sift your way
[03:11:48.800 --> 03:11:52.120]  through it, you don't know whether it's true or not all the time.
[03:11:52.120 --> 03:11:56.560]  But the Internet is truly the only place where you can learn anything real.
[03:11:56.560 --> 03:12:00.840]  But as angry as people are, and as fast as the awakening is happening, every time they
[03:12:00.840 --> 03:12:05.720]  try to censor infowars.com or prisonplanet.com or your Huffington Post article, it only makes
[03:12:05.720 --> 03:12:09.440]  people want to find out what the censorship is all about.
[03:12:09.440 --> 03:12:15.280]  Hopefully, and I'll make one last appeal that you say at AARM, Alex Jones listeners out
[03:12:15.280 --> 03:12:21.200]  there, email that damn Huffington Post and ask, has he censored me?
[03:12:21.200 --> 03:12:25.240]  Did you see the articles, and it isn't just Philadelphia, it's all over the country, taxpayers
[03:12:25.240 --> 03:12:29.680]  pay for laptops, they give them to the kids at the schools, and the principals are watching
[03:12:29.680 --> 03:12:33.360]  the kids in their bedrooms even at home, and how do we learn about this?
[03:12:33.360 --> 03:12:37.160]  The principals are going on TV bragging about it like it's a good thing.
[03:12:37.160 --> 03:12:46.840]  Oh yeah, I saw that, Alex, we've got to wake him up man, people need to understand that
[03:12:46.840 --> 03:12:52.640]  this is supposed to be the country of freedom, this is not East Germany, this is not behind
[03:12:52.640 --> 03:13:00.560]  the iron curtain, but we're heading that way, it just seems that they censor so many countries
[03:13:00.560 --> 03:13:05.720]  in the world where that type of behavior does happen, and it seems that we're going in that
[03:13:05.720 --> 03:13:10.840]  direction rather than heading in the direction of freedom.
[03:13:10.840 --> 03:13:16.240]  His book, Jesse Ventura, American Conspiracies, only out five days already in the top ten
[03:13:16.240 --> 03:13:21.960]  bestseller list, get it discounted with a free film, nobody's offering that at infowars.com
[03:13:21.960 --> 03:13:28.400]  or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[03:13:28.400 --> 03:13:34.160]  Governor continuing here with the book, but I have one final question overall, you've
[03:13:34.160 --> 03:13:40.040]  always questioned the system ever since you learned about JFK, you said 30 years ago,
[03:13:40.040 --> 03:13:44.400]  started researching it, but what has it been like for you, a transformation, really going
[03:13:44.400 --> 03:13:48.880]  down the rabbit hole, really going into the matrix, really immersing yourself in what
[03:13:48.880 --> 03:13:53.760]  they call the conspiracy culture or the culture of simply asking questions?
[03:13:53.760 --> 03:13:58.680]  Well, I don't mind it because when I got done being governor, you know, you get kind
[03:13:58.680 --> 03:14:02.360]  of bored after that job and you've got to, you know, I'm young enough to where I need
[03:14:02.360 --> 03:14:08.800]  to focus on something else, and now I'm focusing on this, and the thing that I like about it
[03:14:08.800 --> 03:14:14.320]  is the fact that it's reality, you know, you're not dealing with what Tom Clancy writes or
[03:14:14.320 --> 03:14:19.160]  what Vince Flynn writes, where they write a great espionage book, but it's all fiction
[03:14:19.160 --> 03:14:21.720]  and it's the product of their imagination.
[03:14:21.720 --> 03:14:26.560]  It's fun to get into things where you can deal with and read about names where you can
[03:14:26.560 --> 03:14:32.720]  put that name to a face, and I find that very intriguing and entertaining to me when I can
[03:14:32.720 --> 03:14:33.720]  do that.
[03:14:33.720 --> 03:14:37.760]  That's right, I mean, truth, they've always said is a lot stranger than fiction, and reality
[03:14:37.760 --> 03:14:43.280]  is so much more complex and real, and it's just so empowering to actually be informed
[03:14:43.280 --> 03:14:47.040]  and be on a journey of knowledge, instead of just watching a television with a bunch
[03:14:47.040 --> 03:14:48.720]  of mindless sitcoms all day.
[03:14:48.720 --> 03:14:49.720]  Exactly.
[03:14:49.720 --> 03:14:53.280]  Oh, wait a minute now, I do like the young and the restless yet.
[03:14:53.280 --> 03:14:57.240]  Oh man, I know, I always read that about you.
[03:14:57.240 --> 03:14:59.360]  You are certainly a character, you are something else.
[03:14:59.360 --> 03:15:03.800]  What do you think your dad would think, highly decorated World War II veteran, looking down
[03:15:03.800 --> 03:15:08.520]  from, you know, heaven or from wherever and seeing what his son has done?
[03:15:08.520 --> 03:15:10.240]  I mean, what an amazing life.
[03:15:10.240 --> 03:15:12.880]  I mean, you've had one of the most interesting lives out there.
[03:15:12.880 --> 03:15:19.760]  Well, you know, I will tell you this, Alex, the major regret of my life is the fact that
[03:15:19.760 --> 03:15:23.880]  when I won Governor, both my mother and father weren't there to see it.
[03:15:23.880 --> 03:15:24.880]  Yeah.
[03:15:24.880 --> 03:15:29.320]  You know, and there's nothing I could do but get this, my mother predicted it.
[03:15:29.320 --> 03:15:34.400]  Not that I would win Governor, but in the last weekend that when before my mom passed
[03:15:34.400 --> 03:15:39.360]  on and we knew it was going to happen, many friends and that came over and all that to
[03:15:39.360 --> 03:15:46.360]  talk to her and they told me, she didn't do it in front of me, but she said to them,
[03:15:46.360 --> 03:15:50.800]  you keep an eye on him because he's going to do something very big.
[03:15:50.800 --> 03:15:58.800]  And this was back in 1995, all I had done was suburban mayor, I was doing talk radio
[03:15:58.800 --> 03:15:59.800]  then.
[03:15:59.800 --> 03:16:04.280]  How did my mother know what was in store for me?
[03:16:04.280 --> 03:16:06.240]  Because you hadn't even thought of running for Governor then.
[03:16:06.240 --> 03:16:08.600]  No, that was the farthest thing from my mind.
[03:16:08.600 --> 03:16:13.200]  I had been a mayor, I was successful, but I wanted to go back to the private sector
[03:16:13.200 --> 03:16:15.720]  again, which is where I was at at that time.
[03:16:15.720 --> 03:16:21.120]  But how did my mom, could she say that the last 48 hours of her life?
[03:16:21.120 --> 03:16:23.600]  Well the time always goes by very quick with Jesse Ventura.
[03:16:23.600 --> 03:16:28.640]  We've only got about four minutes left, 14 chapters in the book, I exposed the fake
[03:16:28.640 --> 03:16:34.280]  loan nuts, the big money plot overthrow FDR, the Bush's grandfather, the Nazi plan, Bush
[03:16:34.280 --> 03:16:39.560]  senior's dad, the Kennedy assassination, the assassination of Malcolm X, Dr. Martin Luther

[03:16:49.080 --> 03:16:54.360]  government dealing drugs, the stolen elections 2004 and almost 2008, what really happened
[03:16:54.360 --> 03:16:59.680]  on September 11th, the Wall Street conspiracy and the secret plan to end American democracy.
[03:16:59.680 --> 03:17:02.960]  Let's talk about 13 and 14 here and what people should get the book.
[03:17:02.960 --> 03:17:07.320]  Wall Street conspiracy briefly and then the secret plan to end American democracy, shadow
[03:17:07.320 --> 03:17:08.320]  government.
[03:17:08.320 --> 03:17:13.320]  Well, you know, they are what they are, you know, the Wall Street conspiracy to me was
[03:17:13.320 --> 03:17:16.440]  an attempt to monopolize for Goldman Sachs.
[03:17:16.440 --> 03:17:21.640]  They let layman brothers fall on their face and yet we pop up Goldman Sachs and isn't
[03:17:21.640 --> 03:17:26.440]  it interesting that every treasury secretary we've had and how many administrations now
[03:17:26.440 --> 03:17:29.600]  has come out of Goldman Sachs?
[03:17:29.600 --> 03:17:30.600]  Almost every one.
[03:17:30.600 --> 03:17:34.640]  Yeah, literally in the last 30, 40 years, every one of them, you're telling me that
[03:17:34.640 --> 03:17:37.600]  they got the market cornered on smartness?
[03:17:37.600 --> 03:17:42.080]  The guy running the Greece collapse 10 years ago and today is Goldman Sachs.
[03:17:42.080 --> 03:17:43.080]  Exactly.
[03:17:43.080 --> 03:17:48.960]  You know, and so, and as far as taking away our democracy, well, you see that right now
[03:17:48.960 --> 03:17:49.960]  happening.
[03:17:49.960 --> 03:17:55.160]  I mean, the shredding of our constitution, the shredding of our bill of rights, the suspension
[03:17:55.160 --> 03:18:00.560]  of habeas corpus and I will say this, those things are the things that have me most of
[03:18:00.560 --> 03:18:04.760]  the time upset about President Obama and of course, the Patriot Act.
[03:18:04.760 --> 03:18:07.240]  Why haven't those things been repealed?
[03:18:07.240 --> 03:18:08.240]  He reauthorized it.
[03:18:08.240 --> 03:18:13.360]  The Democrats, supposedly they got both houses, they got the president and yet they're not
[03:18:13.360 --> 03:18:14.360]  touching it.
[03:18:14.360 --> 03:18:19.360]  So it shows you clearly that there is no difference between the Democrats and Republicans.
[03:18:19.360 --> 03:18:21.920]  They all have the same thing in mind.
[03:18:21.920 --> 03:18:25.640]  And that's the real revolution is taking the states back, third parties, it's starting
[03:18:25.640 --> 03:18:29.520]  to happen, but Obama's created a coffee party to control the left, the Republicans are
[03:18:29.520 --> 03:18:31.560]  taking over the tea party.
[03:18:31.560 --> 03:18:33.040]  What do you think of the tea parties?
[03:18:33.040 --> 03:18:39.880]  Well, the tea party, you know, I'll say this, Alex, I like it when new parties show up because
[03:18:39.880 --> 03:18:45.880]  if they get, I may not agree with them necessarily, but as long as they show up, that still gives
[03:18:45.880 --> 03:18:49.840]  us more choices than to we get beyond Coke and Pepsi.
[03:18:49.840 --> 03:18:54.800]  And so my only, my big criticism of the tea party is that first of all, they're not grassroots,
[03:18:54.800 --> 03:18:57.000]  they're being highly funded.
[03:18:57.000 --> 03:19:04.320]  Second of all is the fact that they're supposed to be a tea party and a constitutional protector
[03:19:04.320 --> 03:19:06.520]  against taxes and all this stuff.
[03:19:06.520 --> 03:19:11.920]  Well, where were they when Bush was in office shredding the Fourth Amendment and suspending
[03:19:11.920 --> 03:19:13.720]  habeas corpus?
[03:19:13.720 --> 03:19:14.720]  Absolutely.
[03:19:14.720 --> 03:19:19.240]  And Obama's continuing the signing statements, the executive orders, all of it showing us
[03:19:19.240 --> 03:19:23.320]  that the same big money interest own the entire paradigm.
[03:19:23.320 --> 03:19:26.840]  Governor, I know you're going to be headed back to Mexico in the next few weeks.
[03:19:26.840 --> 03:19:29.320]  Look forward to seeing you with the TV show.
[03:19:29.320 --> 03:19:32.800]  When you get back, I look forward to hanging out with you and the crew.
[03:19:32.800 --> 03:19:37.320]  And I just want to thank you for taking me along in this great journey.
[03:19:37.320 --> 03:19:39.040]  And it's just been wonderful working with you.
[03:19:39.040 --> 03:19:42.320]  And I look forward to all the great, great things you're going to do in the future, sir.
[03:19:42.320 --> 03:19:46.480]  Well, first of all, Alex, I joined you on the journey because you were on the journey
[03:19:46.480 --> 03:19:48.000]  before I was.
[03:19:48.000 --> 03:19:51.640]  I know, but you're helping, I mean, you're bringing it to a new level.
[03:19:51.640 --> 03:19:56.120]  And we just, you're, you've got a great spirit, you're a good man, and we love you, Governor
[03:19:56.120 --> 03:19:57.120]  Jesse Ventura.
[03:19:57.120 --> 03:20:27.080]  That's the new book, infowars.com, already a bestseller.
[03:20:58.080 --> 03:20:58.080]  877-479-8178.
[03:20:58.080 --> 03:20:58.080]  877-479-8178.
[03:20:58.080 --> 03:21:27.040]  Originally, we, the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency,
[03:21:27.040 --> 03:21:31.280]  and this is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to
[03:21:31.280 --> 03:21:35.320]  our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its
[03:21:35.320 --> 03:21:36.320]  original value.
[03:21:36.320 --> 03:21:41.160]  Now, foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[03:21:41.160 --> 03:21:42.840]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[03:21:42.840 --> 03:21:45.880]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.
[03:21:45.880 --> 03:21:49.880]  Call me today at 800-686-2237.
[03:21:49.880 --> 03:21:53.400]  I will give you a silver dollar free just for purchasing the book.
[03:21:53.400 --> 03:22:03.200]  Call today at 800-686-2237, again, that's 800-686-2237.
[03:22:03.200 --> 03:22:06.920]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:22:06.920 --> 03:22:10.080]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:22:10.080 --> 03:22:14.440]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[03:22:14.440 --> 03:22:15.440]  at home.
[03:22:15.440 --> 03:22:20.600]  We have tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are calling the
[03:22:20.600 --> 03:22:21.600]  shots.
[03:22:21.600 --> 03:22:26.320]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:22:26.320 --> 03:22:29.760]  The fall of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[03:22:29.760 --> 03:22:35.600]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes constructing
[03:22:35.600 --> 03:22:36.600]  world government.
[03:22:36.600 --> 03:22:39.000]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[03:22:39.000 --> 03:22:43.120]  They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:22:43.120 --> 03:22:48.520]  Today, it seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen
[03:22:48.520 --> 03:22:50.360]  a fall of the republic.
[03:22:50.360 --> 03:22:54.800]  Get your copy of fall of the republic on DVD at infowars.com.
[03:22:54.800 --> 03:23:04.020]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[03:23:04.020 --> 03:23:10.280]  As the economy continues to decline, patriots across a nation are preparing for the worst.
[03:23:10.280 --> 03:23:12.480]  The world is changing fast.
[03:23:12.480 --> 03:23:14.720]  Are you fully prepared?
[03:23:14.720 --> 03:23:17.960]  Or will you be forced to eat government soup?
[03:23:17.960 --> 03:23:26.440]  At www.patriotfood.com, we offer you 135 pounds of dehydrated food and six varieties of canned
[03:23:26.440 --> 03:23:28.680]  meat for half price.
[03:23:28.680 --> 03:23:37.000]  And at survivalistseeds.com, we now offer 50 non-GMO varieties of vegetables and over
[03:23:37.000 --> 03:23:40.200]  10,000 heirloom seeds.
[03:23:40.200 --> 03:23:45.240]  That's twice as many as our competition for the same price.
[03:23:45.240 --> 03:23:52.520]  At www.patriotfood.com and survivalistseeds.com, food insurance just in case.
[03:23:52.520 --> 03:24:19.360]  And by me, Big John Lipscomb, host of Don't Tread on Me Radio Show.
[03:24:19.360 --> 03:24:26.960]  This has been one hell of a Friday edition, I'll be back live Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:24:26.960 --> 03:24:32.960]  Sun never mind, and then breaks, let it all hang out because we got a run to make.
[03:24:32.960 --> 03:24:36.880]  We're not shipping a bunch of beer in an 18 wheeler, we're bringing liberty and freedom
[03:24:36.880 --> 03:24:37.880]  and the Constitution.
[03:24:37.880 --> 03:24:44.280]  Well, a few months ago I was amazed to see video of constitutional lawyer, very successful
[03:24:44.280 --> 03:24:49.720]  counselor Gary Fielder going in to the county where Denver is at and saying no to the naked
[03:24:49.720 --> 03:24:53.360]  body scanner and he got the policy change because it violates child porn laws.
[03:24:53.360 --> 03:24:55.440]  18 and under, they don't scan you.
[03:24:55.440 --> 03:24:59.200]  People can now be patted down if they want because, you know, we're the evil prisoners.
[03:24:59.200 --> 03:25:02.320]  He couldn't even practice law there without doing this.
[03:25:02.320 --> 03:25:06.280]  They were blocking his access to the courts, violating his constitutional rights.
[03:25:06.280 --> 03:25:11.440]  And now we've shown Homeland Security 18 wheeler trucks, speaking of 18 wheelers, and the globalist
[03:25:11.440 --> 03:25:12.880]  have got their run to make.
[03:25:12.880 --> 03:25:17.240]  They said they're going to have them at concerts, outside malls, at highway checkpoints.
[03:25:17.240 --> 03:25:21.480]  So as we told you, anything they do in the airport is a beta test for everywhere else.
[03:25:21.480 --> 03:25:26.600]  So when I heard that this gentleman was coming here to Austin, Texas, I wanted to get him
[03:25:26.600 --> 03:25:27.800]  in studio.
[03:25:27.800 --> 03:25:29.640]  So Gary Fielder, it's great to have you here with us.
[03:25:29.640 --> 03:25:30.880]  Alex, thank you so much.
[03:25:30.880 --> 03:25:32.920]  What a wonderful place you have here.
[03:25:32.920 --> 03:25:36.880]  You don't really realize how great of an operation is until you get here and get to walk around
[03:25:36.880 --> 03:25:37.880]  a little bit.
[03:25:37.880 --> 03:25:38.880]  Congratulations.
[03:25:38.880 --> 03:25:39.880]  You've really done a wonderful job.
[03:25:39.880 --> 03:25:40.880]  Well, it's not that.
[03:25:40.880 --> 03:25:43.400]  It's cozy, but we just expanded and we're building a TV studio.
[03:25:43.400 --> 03:25:44.400]  But thank you.
[03:25:44.400 --> 03:25:45.400]  All right.
[03:25:45.400 --> 03:25:46.400]  This is a short segment.
[03:25:46.400 --> 03:25:48.320]  I'm going to try to shut up here and get into the fight against the naked body scanners.
[03:25:48.320 --> 03:25:49.920]  I've been really not promoting it.
[03:25:49.920 --> 03:25:50.920]  $15,000 in prizes.
[03:25:50.920 --> 03:25:53.880]  We need to get a banner up on Info Wars and prison punt.
[03:25:53.880 --> 03:25:54.880]  I asked for that.
[03:25:54.880 --> 03:25:55.880]  We need to get the guys to do that.
[03:25:55.880 --> 03:26:00.880]  I know they're busy about the contest to expose the naked body scanners.
[03:26:00.880 --> 03:26:04.240]  But what you're doing is legal and you're traveling the country, but you're also talking
[03:26:04.240 --> 03:26:08.800]  about the overall attack on our bill of rights and constitution from the unique perspective
[03:26:08.800 --> 03:26:10.400]  as a constitutional lawyer.
[03:26:10.400 --> 03:26:13.760]  So break down the naked body scanners and everything else that's happening.
[03:26:13.760 --> 03:26:19.080]  Well, the naked body scanner story started when I went down to a local County Douglas
[03:26:19.080 --> 03:26:25.640]  County and I had protested a couple of other times and had been just completely searched
[03:26:25.640 --> 03:26:27.840]  as I detailed on your show.
[03:26:27.840 --> 03:26:31.760]  So there just came a point where there had to be a breaking point where I wasn't going
[03:26:31.760 --> 03:26:34.440]  to go through the scanner and I wasn't going to be touched.
[03:26:34.440 --> 03:26:39.880]  I just got a call a couple of days ago from an oathkeeper on the plane on the tarmac at
[03:26:39.880 --> 03:26:42.960]  San Francisco outraged at what he had just gone through.
[03:26:42.960 --> 03:26:47.880]  He refused the scanner and just like we talked about, they ran their hands up and down his
[03:26:47.880 --> 03:26:48.880]  legs.
[03:26:48.880 --> 03:26:49.880]  They grabbed your genitals.
[03:26:49.880 --> 03:26:51.380]  They grabbed your wife's genitals.
[03:26:51.380 --> 03:26:57.000]  They ran his fingers through his hair and he was on the phone talking to me outraged
[03:26:57.000 --> 03:26:58.000]  at what he had to go through.
[03:26:58.000 --> 03:27:01.720]  There was no third option of a metal detector, a wand.
[03:27:01.720 --> 03:27:03.680]  And clearly it's harassment.
[03:27:03.680 --> 03:27:06.600]  There's no legitimate reason for it.
[03:27:06.600 --> 03:27:12.440]  Name one instance where an American got on a plane and flew it into a building.
[03:27:12.440 --> 03:27:17.740]  Name one instance where a guy went down to the commercial airline and did anything other
[03:27:17.740 --> 03:27:20.400]  than try to get on to a plane.
[03:27:20.400 --> 03:27:25.000]  So it's an issue where people are just going to have to stand up for their rights and I
[03:27:25.000 --> 03:27:27.120]  heard you talking to Mr. Ventura.
[03:27:27.120 --> 03:27:29.040]  At first you're going to have to be searched.
[03:27:29.040 --> 03:27:31.320]  Do not go through that body scanner.
[03:27:31.320 --> 03:27:34.160]  That's an absolute degradation of your rights.
[03:27:34.160 --> 03:27:40.580]  The idea of having a naked picture of me stored on a hard drive is repugnant enough to actually
[03:27:40.580 --> 03:27:42.080]  have to go through the...
[03:27:42.080 --> 03:27:44.720]  And a month ago they said it was going to be voluntary.
[03:27:44.720 --> 03:27:48.000]  Now they're saying, oh, maybe it will be mandatory.
[03:27:48.000 --> 03:27:49.800]  Well there's going to have to be an alternative.
[03:27:49.800 --> 03:27:51.800]  We got to thinking about it back in Denver.
[03:27:51.800 --> 03:27:53.900]  It's not just about getting on a plane.
[03:27:53.900 --> 03:27:57.120]  What if you get on a plane and then you can't get back?
[03:27:57.120 --> 03:27:58.400]  What about your family?
[03:27:58.400 --> 03:27:59.800]  What about your business waiting for you?
[03:27:59.800 --> 03:28:02.880]  What if you get stranded because you just stand up for your constitutional rights?
[03:28:02.880 --> 03:28:04.400]  So we all know where this is going.
[03:28:04.400 --> 03:28:05.880]  This is going to the federal court.
[03:28:05.880 --> 03:28:07.520]  They're going to have to decide this.
[03:28:07.520 --> 03:28:10.280]  They're going to have to decide this on the issue of privacy.
[03:28:10.280 --> 03:28:16.400]  And so there's a lot of cases that have come out in favor of reproductive rights and things
[03:28:16.400 --> 03:28:22.080]  like that which sort of interweave a right to privacy into our constitution, which some
[03:28:22.080 --> 03:28:24.800]  of us have objected to over time.
[03:28:24.800 --> 03:28:31.160]  We're going to have to use that same case law and put it over into a right to privacy
[03:28:31.160 --> 03:28:32.160]  connected with a right to travel.
[03:28:32.160 --> 03:28:34.160]  And a presumption of innocence.
[03:28:34.160 --> 03:28:38.480]  They sell it like, oh, we don't discriminate, everyone is tracked and traced.
[03:28:38.480 --> 03:28:43.560]  But then in reality that gets rid of any type of probable cause or due process where, oh,
[03:28:43.560 --> 03:28:45.320]  you have rights to have no rights.
[03:28:45.320 --> 03:28:46.320]  Right.
[03:28:46.320 --> 03:28:47.320]  You have rights to have no rights.
[03:28:47.320 --> 03:28:49.840]  Now this is why I'm so excited about the issue of sovereignty.
[03:28:49.840 --> 03:28:54.040]  Because in order to look somebody in the eye and say no, in order to say, hey, I'd rather
[03:28:54.040 --> 03:28:59.000]  not do that, whether it be acting like a monkey on the side of the road at the direction of
[03:28:59.000 --> 03:29:05.280]  a police officer, whether it be completely having your body touched or having your naked
[03:29:05.280 --> 03:29:09.040]  body photographed at some point, you got to be able to square up and say no, sir, I'd
[03:29:09.040 --> 03:29:10.520]  really rather not do that.
[03:29:10.520 --> 03:29:15.600]  And that requires the consciousness of a sovereign, not the consciousness of a slave
[03:29:15.600 --> 03:29:18.200]  that says, you know, no, no, I don't want to do that.
[03:29:18.200 --> 03:29:19.200]  I'm scared.
[03:29:19.200 --> 03:29:22.280]  The consciousness of a sovereign that stands up and says no, sir, there's going to have
[03:29:22.280 --> 03:29:25.600]  to be another option because they're always pushing the boundaries.
[03:29:25.600 --> 03:29:29.240]  Now they say suicide bombers may have fake breast implants.
[03:29:29.240 --> 03:29:31.040]  We need to X-ray you.
[03:29:31.040 --> 03:29:34.640]  And this system already gives you some radiation, but even more, we're going to come back and
[03:29:34.640 --> 03:29:38.000]  talk about the event you've got coming up in Austin, how folks can go to that.
[03:29:38.000 --> 03:29:42.600]  We're going to talk about a lot more and continue to talk about the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[03:29:42.600 --> 03:29:46.800]  And now they want mobile, well, they have them mobile 18 wheelers where they're going
[03:29:46.800 --> 03:29:52.160]  to hurt you and your family at checkpoints through these and take your blood.
[03:29:52.160 --> 03:29:59.640]  Here on the March, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[03:29:59.640 --> 03:30:07.280]  Hi, folks, this is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:30:07.280 --> 03:30:12.120]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into
[03:30:12.120 --> 03:30:16.120]  the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[03:30:16.120 --> 03:30:20.760]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[03:30:20.760 --> 03:30:26.000]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver
[03:30:26.000 --> 03:30:32.280]  solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[03:30:32.280 --> 03:30:36.600]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now
[03:30:36.600 --> 03:30:41.920]  produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:30:41.920 --> 03:30:47.200]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[03:30:47.200 --> 03:30:53.440]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver
[03:30:53.440 --> 03:30:54.440]  Lungs Generator.
[03:30:54.440 --> 03:31:03.440]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[03:31:03.440 --> 03:31:07.280]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:31:07.280 --> 03:31:10.440]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:31:10.440 --> 03:31:14.800]  As we're finishing off this agenda, there will be pulling the rug from underneath Americans
[03:31:14.800 --> 03:31:15.800]  at home.
[03:31:15.800 --> 03:31:20.800]  We've turned an endless influence on our president and Congress, and they really are calling
[03:31:20.800 --> 03:31:21.800]  the shots.
[03:31:21.800 --> 03:31:26.800]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:31:26.800 --> 03:31:30.080]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[03:31:30.080 --> 03:31:35.920]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing
[03:31:35.920 --> 03:31:36.920]  world government.
[03:31:36.920 --> 03:31:39.320]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[03:31:39.320 --> 03:31:43.480]  They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[03:31:43.480 --> 03:31:49.320]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[03:31:49.320 --> 03:31:50.320]  of the Republic.
[03:31:50.320 --> 03:31:56.760]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com or watch it online right

[03:32:06.400 --> 03:32:08.400]  Afraid to answer it?

[03:32:10.320 --> 03:32:14.520]  Would you know that debt settlement bankruptcy and attorneys will cost you about 10 times
[03:32:14.520 --> 03:32:17.640]  more than you would legally be required to pay creditors?
[03:32:17.640 --> 03:32:19.800]  These are not ways to help you get out of debt.
[03:32:19.800 --> 03:32:21.840]  They are expensive payment plans.
[03:32:21.840 --> 03:32:25.920]  And if you're in debt already, does it make sense to load yourself up with another payment
[03:32:25.920 --> 03:32:26.920]  plan?
[03:32:26.920 --> 03:32:31.080]  Zero debt in 90 days gets you out of debt in 90 days, guaranteed.

[03:33:15.640 --> 03:33:19.640]  I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors that have made today's radio show with Bob

[03:34:34.560 --> 03:34:43.600]  so take action today, MySolarBackup.com, now going back to Gary Fielder, Gary, continuing,
[03:34:43.600 --> 03:34:49.440]  my issue here is it's not just this act of submission, this pointlessness, they helped
[03:34:49.440 --> 03:34:53.680]  the underwear bomber get on the plane, that's now admitted, but they bury it in footnotes
[03:34:53.680 --> 03:34:57.200]  in the news, now they have, have you seen the video of these big mobile trucks?
[03:34:57.200 --> 03:34:58.200]  No, I haven't.
[03:34:58.200 --> 03:35:02.040]  In fact, we played that Tuesday, try to pull that up just while he's talking, show the
[03:35:02.040 --> 03:35:08.720]  mobile trucks with body scanners, brain scanners, here's AFP today, brain scans can read people's
[03:35:08.720 --> 03:35:09.720]  thoughts.
[03:35:09.720 --> 03:35:15.280]  Here, it took decades to prove that the, that the lie detectors were quackery, it was just
[03:35:15.280 --> 03:35:20.720]  a way to send innocent people to prison, this is even worse, so this, as bad as it sounds,
[03:35:20.720 --> 03:35:24.040]  this is only the beginning, these body scanners, please continue.
[03:35:24.040 --> 03:35:29.800]  Well, again, it comes down to having, first of all, enough intestinal fortitude to say
[03:35:29.800 --> 03:35:34.080]  no, but when you say no, then what's going to happen, it sort of shifts the burden if
[03:35:34.080 --> 03:35:39.400]  you will, and I don't want to put anybody in danger, nobody wants to get their arm twisted
[03:35:39.400 --> 03:35:43.880]  up their back or arrested, but when you're at an airport and you're just simply standing
[03:35:43.880 --> 03:35:48.080]  up for your right to privacy, the next issue becomes the alternative.
[03:35:48.080 --> 03:35:51.200]  They're going to have to give an alternative to children.
[03:35:51.200 --> 03:35:52.280]  That's set in stone.
[03:35:52.280 --> 03:35:53.800]  The British government said that.
[03:35:53.800 --> 03:35:58.560]  So if you're going to run 16 and 17-year-old young men and women through, well, why can't
[03:35:58.560 --> 03:36:03.400]  an old 46-year-old like me go in that line and just have to put up with the search?
[03:36:03.400 --> 03:36:07.680]  I'll do that twice, but at some point, the federal court's going to have to issue, or
[03:36:07.680 --> 03:36:08.680]  your state court.
[03:36:08.680 --> 03:36:13.800]  I don't think the state court will have jurisdiction over TSA, so ultimately, it's going to have
[03:36:13.800 --> 03:36:15.560]  to wind up in a federal court.
[03:36:15.560 --> 03:36:18.480]  And we've got to buck this, or they're going to put it in everywhere, like the courthouse.
[03:36:18.480 --> 03:36:20.480]  Well, this has to be nipped in the bud now.
[03:36:20.480 --> 03:36:21.480]  And you had success.
[03:36:21.480 --> 03:36:25.880]  Well, I had success in the courthouse because it was a little bit different because you
[03:36:25.880 --> 03:36:28.280]  had to go to court.
[03:36:28.280 --> 03:36:29.840]  Witnesses were subpoenaed to court.
[03:36:29.840 --> 03:36:32.600]  Lawyers were on the docket to be there.
[03:36:32.600 --> 03:36:35.400]  There's always this issue of, well, just don't get on the plane.
[03:36:35.400 --> 03:36:36.680]  Take a plane.
[03:36:36.680 --> 03:36:37.680]  Drive your car.
[03:36:37.680 --> 03:36:41.760]  That kind of goes against the right to travel, but they want to use their ability to reasonably
[03:36:41.760 --> 03:36:42.760]  regulate.
[03:36:42.760 --> 03:36:45.920]  So all of those different issues are going to clash.
[03:36:45.920 --> 03:36:47.440]  So now's the time to do it.
[03:36:47.440 --> 03:36:51.920]  Now's the time to get in to federal court and get this issue litigated.
[03:36:51.920 --> 03:36:53.680]  Now, what does that mean?
[03:36:53.680 --> 03:36:55.760]  That means waiting.
[03:36:55.760 --> 03:36:57.100]  That means being patient.
[03:36:57.100 --> 03:36:59.000]  That means picking the perfect plaintiff.
[03:36:59.000 --> 03:37:03.840]  That means trying to get it into the jurisdiction that you think is going to be most favorable.
[03:37:03.840 --> 03:37:07.880]  Not just filing some injunction tomorrow down at your local courthouse.
[03:37:07.880 --> 03:37:10.120]  So this is going to have to be a sophisticated fight.
[03:37:10.120 --> 03:37:11.440]  That's what it's going to have to be.
[03:37:11.440 --> 03:37:14.440]  But it needs to be done now before they're all installed.
[03:37:14.440 --> 03:37:18.680]  I went through Denver International Airport two weeks ago and they had two lines.
[03:37:18.680 --> 03:37:20.920]  One with the scanner, one without.
[03:37:20.920 --> 03:37:23.920]  It was about 50-50, so I got to choose.
[03:37:23.920 --> 03:37:28.040]  So they're just trying to integrate them in so that the next time I go down there, there's
[03:37:28.040 --> 03:37:29.040]  going to be two.
[03:37:29.040 --> 03:37:33.040]  But there's going to have to be a third line for some reasonable alternative.
[03:37:33.040 --> 03:37:36.760]  So the real issue is what is the reasonable alternative?
[03:37:36.760 --> 03:37:41.680]  I think I can convince the federal judge that having your body touched is just as bad as
[03:37:41.680 --> 03:37:43.160]  having your body photographed.
[03:37:43.160 --> 03:37:47.680]  Well, there's also the angle separately to go after Chertoff, who made the orders for
[03:37:47.680 --> 03:37:51.040]  these billions of dollars of machines when he was the head of Homeland Security and now
[03:37:51.040 --> 03:37:53.120]  makes money from it.
[03:37:53.120 --> 03:37:54.880]  There's more than one way to skin a cat as well.
[03:37:54.880 --> 03:37:57.040]  Well, it's not just a matter of inconvenience.
[03:37:57.040 --> 03:38:03.760]  We've all been grossly inconvenienced just trying to get onto a plane, so we just stand
[03:38:03.760 --> 03:38:06.120]  there and take that for an hour and a half.
[03:38:06.120 --> 03:38:11.560]  This is seriously about touching your body or taking a photograph of your naked body.
[03:38:11.560 --> 03:38:18.000]  I think that's about as invasive as you can get other than extracting bodily fluid.
[03:38:18.000 --> 03:38:19.000]  We're right at it.
[03:38:19.000 --> 03:38:20.000]  Well, they do that in Texas now.
[03:38:20.000 --> 03:38:21.680]  They take blood without warrants at checkpoints.
[03:38:21.680 --> 03:38:22.680]  Right.
[03:38:22.680 --> 03:38:25.120]  First, it was these fake warrants they would swear out for everybody.
[03:38:25.120 --> 03:38:28.680]  Now that's just legislature said, yeah, then no more Fourth Amendment.
[03:38:28.680 --> 03:38:33.080]  Well, people come up to me as a criminal lawyer and they always ask about DUI, what should
[03:38:33.080 --> 03:38:35.280]  I do when I get pulled over?
[03:38:35.280 --> 03:38:40.760]  I don't give that advice of crack the windshield, slip your driver's license out.
[03:38:40.760 --> 03:38:41.760]  I don't say that.
[03:38:41.760 --> 03:38:46.520]  I say, roll down your window, be pleasant, be nice, but be short.
[03:38:46.520 --> 03:38:48.680]  You don't need to speak to the government.
[03:38:48.680 --> 03:38:50.800]  You don't need to get out of your vehicle.
[03:38:50.800 --> 03:38:54.200]  You need to show them your documentation and ask to move forward.
[03:38:54.200 --> 03:38:57.240]  At every level, you have to check that officer.
[03:38:57.240 --> 03:38:59.640]  Otherwise, you're going to be out of that car.
[03:38:59.640 --> 03:39:02.560]  You're going to be in front of headlights jumping around on one foot and spending on
[03:39:02.560 --> 03:39:05.720]  the way to stop the DUI checkpoints is on the Fourth Amendment, obviously, but on top
[03:39:05.720 --> 03:39:09.720]  of that, the illegal aliens and 800 plus cities are given a free pass.
[03:39:09.720 --> 03:39:10.720]  That's discriminatory.
[03:39:10.720 --> 03:39:12.400]  Well, that's a whole different issue.
[03:39:12.400 --> 03:39:18.120]  That's really hitting Denver hard because a local person whose child was unfortunately
[03:39:18.120 --> 03:39:22.360]  killed at a Baskin Robbins has just sued the city and county of Denver.
[03:39:22.360 --> 03:39:27.120]  I believe the state of Colorado and a couple of different agencies for continuously giving
[03:39:27.120 --> 03:39:32.880]  this particular gentleman who was driving pass after pass after pass on habitual traffic
[03:39:32.880 --> 03:39:37.080]  fender tickets, driving under revocation, but they just give him a pass.
[03:39:37.080 --> 03:39:39.480]  So sure enough, let me guess he was an illegal.
[03:39:39.480 --> 03:39:40.480]  Yes.
[03:39:40.480 --> 03:39:43.560]  No, no, I mean, in Austin, I've talked to the county officials.
[03:39:43.560 --> 03:39:46.840]  They say they're allowed to run people over in their let go.
[03:39:46.840 --> 03:39:48.360]  I mean, it's God level.
[03:39:48.360 --> 03:39:50.720]  A cop can't be drunk driving and kill somebody.
[03:39:50.720 --> 03:39:56.640]  I mean, this is, I mean, literally, I ought to change my name to like, you know, Juan
[03:39:56.640 --> 03:39:58.880]  Gonzalez and just be God.
[03:39:58.880 --> 03:40:03.680]  It's sent a shiver through the spine of every police officer and every police chief and
[03:40:03.680 --> 03:40:06.480]  every politician who now has to deal with this issue.
[03:40:06.480 --> 03:40:11.480]  And so I'm not encouraging lawsuits, but I am as much as we badmouth the federal court.
[03:40:11.480 --> 03:40:12.480]  That's why it's down the street.
[03:40:12.480 --> 03:40:15.560]  Well, we have to bring force to bear on people that are violating our rights.
[03:40:15.560 --> 03:40:17.360]  You're not going to find the remedy in state court.
[03:40:17.360 --> 03:40:21.480]  You're going to have to go to the federal court and file either injunctions, declaratory
[03:40:21.480 --> 03:40:22.480]  actions, lawsuits.
[03:40:22.480 --> 03:40:25.880]  I mean, if someone touches me, I consider that a harm.
[03:40:25.880 --> 03:40:29.320]  Well, Gary Fielder, I'm asking a lot of questions here and we're running out of time and this
[03:40:29.320 --> 03:40:30.320]  is a great interview with you.
[03:40:30.320 --> 03:40:31.320]  I want to have you back.
[03:40:31.320 --> 03:40:34.320]  But the time we've got left, the 20 minutes we've got left, give us the website, tell
[03:40:34.320 --> 03:40:35.320]  us about the event.
[03:40:35.320 --> 03:40:37.200]  I'm told you've got a new DVD out.
[03:40:37.200 --> 03:40:38.200]  Tell us about all that.
[03:40:38.200 --> 03:40:39.200]  Okay.
[03:40:39.200 --> 03:40:41.800]  I'm working on a DVD that's coming out hopefully in August.
[03:40:41.800 --> 03:40:46.640]  I'm traveling the western side of the country giving seminars on sovereignty.
[03:40:46.640 --> 03:40:52.840]  Part of the problem that I see is that we carry around with us the consciousness of
[03:40:52.840 --> 03:40:53.840]  a slave.
[03:40:53.840 --> 03:40:54.840]  And it's not our fault.
[03:40:54.840 --> 03:40:56.320]  We were just brought up like that.
[03:40:56.320 --> 03:40:57.320]  We've capitulated.
[03:40:57.320 --> 03:40:59.960]  We're like a whore who has a pimp beating her up.
[03:40:59.960 --> 03:41:00.960]  And we've been brainwashed.
[03:41:00.960 --> 03:41:06.520]  That TV is just pounding us every day and commercials and all of the media that we see
[03:41:06.520 --> 03:41:08.760]  through newspapers, books.
[03:41:08.760 --> 03:41:12.760]  So subconscious gets bombarded with a lot of information.
[03:41:12.760 --> 03:41:17.680]  To think of yourself as a sovereign is one thing, to know legally that you're a sovereign
[03:41:17.680 --> 03:41:18.680]  is another.
[03:41:18.680 --> 03:41:25.400]  So what I make, I outline a seven-hour argument with a 200-page handout that absolutely outlines
[03:41:25.400 --> 03:41:30.480]  that your forefathers, Mr. Jones, they settled this country, they spilled their blood, they
[03:41:30.480 --> 03:41:34.760]  fought the Revolutionary War, and they formed this nation and they were declared sovereigns.
[03:41:34.760 --> 03:41:37.960]  And they were mental giants, celebrated the world over.
[03:41:37.960 --> 03:41:39.480]  We're going to do what they've set up.
[03:41:39.480 --> 03:41:41.880]  We're not going to follow this tyranny.
[03:41:41.880 --> 03:41:43.200]  Their posterity is you.
[03:41:43.200 --> 03:41:44.800]  Their posterity is me.
[03:41:44.800 --> 03:41:48.040]  So when I start talking about sovereignty, everybody always wants to talk about, whoa,
[03:41:48.040 --> 03:41:50.880]  that makes me better or that makes me more immune.
[03:41:50.880 --> 03:41:52.320]  It's not about that anymore.
[03:41:52.320 --> 03:41:54.720]  It's the responsibility that a sovereign has.
[03:41:54.720 --> 03:41:56.680]  It's the duty that a sovereign has.
[03:41:56.680 --> 03:41:58.480]  I'm missing a volleyball game tonight.
[03:41:58.480 --> 03:42:00.400]  I don't want to miss that volleyball game.
[03:42:00.400 --> 03:42:02.720]  But as a sovereign, it's my duty.
[03:42:02.720 --> 03:42:03.720]  You've got to do what you've got to do.
[03:42:03.720 --> 03:42:04.720]  And it's that sense of duty.
[03:42:04.720 --> 03:42:06.080]  I mean, it's not like it's even work.
[03:42:06.080 --> 03:42:10.360]  Once you're possessed by the animating spirit of liberty, as Thomas Jefferson said, with
[03:42:10.360 --> 03:42:14.160]  the fire of liberty in your mind, and then it spreads, tell us about the event coming
[03:42:14.160 --> 03:42:15.160]  up in Austin.
[03:42:15.160 --> 03:42:16.160]  Okay.
[03:42:16.160 --> 03:42:19.120]  I'm at the AT&T event center tomorrow.
[03:42:19.120 --> 03:42:21.720]  Check in is at 830.
[03:42:21.720 --> 03:42:23.600]  The seminar lasts from nine to four.
[03:42:23.600 --> 03:42:27.800]  There's breaks in the morning and there's a break in the afternoon and lunch.
[03:42:27.800 --> 03:42:31.680]  The AT&T event center is at, I believe, the bottom of the tower by the water fountain
[03:42:31.680 --> 03:42:32.680]  down there.
[03:42:32.680 --> 03:42:35.200]  We've got a room set up for 65.
[03:42:35.200 --> 03:42:38.640]  And so it's a PowerPoint presentation with moving video and a handout.
[03:42:38.640 --> 03:42:42.680]  Uh-oh, you shouldn't have come on the show, you're going to turn away 500.
[03:42:42.680 --> 03:42:43.880]  People should still try to get in.
[03:42:43.880 --> 03:42:48.800]  Well, I do charge tuition of $100, which a lot of people criticize, but it does cost
[03:42:48.800 --> 03:42:49.800]  me a lot of money.
[03:42:49.800 --> 03:42:50.800]  Hey, you had to pay to drive here.
[03:42:50.800 --> 03:42:51.800]  You had to pay to fly here.
[03:42:51.800 --> 03:42:52.800]  You know what?
[03:42:52.800 --> 03:42:54.680]  That's an enemy conditioning operation.
[03:42:54.680 --> 03:42:56.520]  You shouldn't sell a Jesse Ventura book.
[03:42:56.520 --> 03:42:58.720]  You shouldn't produce films and have your own operation.
[03:42:58.720 --> 03:43:02.680]  How are we ever going to fund ourselves when the government uses our own tax money to enslave
[03:43:02.680 --> 03:43:03.680]  us?
[03:43:03.680 --> 03:43:04.880]  No, people need to spend more money.
[03:43:04.880 --> 03:43:06.800]  They need to support everybody.
[03:43:06.800 --> 03:43:09.520]  That's what my show is, is a platform for people like you.
[03:43:09.520 --> 03:43:13.960]  Well, I really appreciate it just to get a flavor of what it will be like.
[03:43:13.960 --> 03:43:15.760]  There's a free video called Gig is Up.
[03:43:15.760 --> 03:43:19.960]  It's on my website, gigisup.net, and that kind of gives you an idea of where we're going
[03:43:19.960 --> 03:43:20.960]  with this.
[03:43:20.960 --> 03:43:21.960]  So this starts when in the morning?
[03:43:21.960 --> 03:43:27.240]  The check-in is at 8.30, and the seminar starts at 9, but I typically don't get going
[03:43:27.240 --> 03:43:29.240]  until about 9, 10, or 9.15.
[03:43:29.240 --> 03:43:35.280]  So come by, and everybody that's been to the seminars, I've given one in Denver, Omaha,
[03:43:35.280 --> 03:43:40.200]  and L.A. have come out of there feeling an entirely different way.
[03:43:40.200 --> 03:43:43.600]  They walk out of there with their shoulders pinned back thinking, all right, I'm going
[03:43:43.600 --> 03:43:44.600]  to find out about my family.
[03:43:44.600 --> 03:43:45.600]  Yeah, that's right.
[03:43:45.600 --> 03:43:49.600]  People think that it's our position to be slaves and to be tasered and beat up and in
[03:43:49.600 --> 03:43:54.240]  scream debt and for people to be rude to us, that government's got and their paychecks
[03:43:54.240 --> 03:43:56.320]  go up, our paychecks go down.
[03:43:56.320 --> 03:43:57.320]  That's not the case.
[03:43:57.320 --> 03:44:01.360]  Okay, in the 15 minutes we've got left, let's launch into your legal arguments against the
[03:44:01.360 --> 03:44:08.080]  naked body scanners and other unconstitutional issues and where you see this society going.
[03:44:08.080 --> 03:44:12.000]  Well, the hard thing to get in federal court is standing.
[03:44:12.000 --> 03:44:15.800]  You can't just go into federal court and say, hey, your honor, I want these body scanners
[03:44:15.800 --> 03:44:16.800]  out of the airport.
[03:44:16.800 --> 03:44:17.800]  I want them out of the courthouse.
[03:44:17.800 --> 03:44:19.640]  Well, you have to have harm.
[03:44:19.640 --> 03:44:23.680]  There has to be a remedy because you've suffered a violation of either your constitutional
[03:44:23.680 --> 03:44:26.600]  rights or your personal body.
[03:44:26.600 --> 03:44:33.320]  I think having to involuntarily be subject to a search when I've done absolutely nothing
[03:44:33.320 --> 03:44:34.320]  wrong.
[03:44:34.320 --> 03:44:38.120]  And the Ninth Circuit just ruled two weeks ago, the police can break in your house without
[03:44:38.120 --> 03:44:40.840]  a warrant with no presumption, no probable cause.
[03:44:40.840 --> 03:44:42.120]  I mean, this is insane.
[03:44:42.120 --> 03:44:47.840]  Now, I'm not saying I'm going to be the one to do it, but I'm just saying if I were to
[03:44:47.840 --> 03:44:50.680]  be a plaintiff, what would be my legal status?
[03:44:50.680 --> 03:44:53.040]  My legal status would be of a sovereign.
[03:44:53.040 --> 03:44:58.640]  I wouldn't come to the court as a lowly citizen begging for mercy.
[03:44:58.640 --> 03:45:02.560]  I'd walk in there as a sovereign and say, your honor, I need redress.
[03:45:02.560 --> 03:45:03.720]  I need remedy.
[03:45:03.720 --> 03:45:07.360]  I need to get on a plane every now and then for my business or it's going to be hard.
[03:45:07.360 --> 03:45:08.520]  Because rights aren't given.
[03:45:08.520 --> 03:45:09.520]  They're demanded.
[03:45:09.520 --> 03:45:10.520]  They're taken.
[03:45:10.520 --> 03:45:15.600]  Well, they've been bestowed upon us by our creator and they're inalienable.
[03:45:15.600 --> 03:45:17.560]  And that's what we have to stand upon.
[03:45:17.560 --> 03:45:22.200]  That's not a document, fancy, handwritten thing that you hang on the wall.
[03:45:22.200 --> 03:45:27.960]  If you go to the statutes at large, volume one, page one is the Declaration of Independence.
[03:45:27.960 --> 03:45:30.240]  It's as good a law as any law you're going to find.
[03:45:30.240 --> 03:45:31.240]  It's a supreme law.
[03:45:31.240 --> 03:45:32.240]  So I'm here.
[03:45:32.240 --> 03:45:33.240]  I'm here.
[03:45:33.240 --> 03:45:34.960]  I'm a federal judge.
[03:45:34.960 --> 03:45:37.880]  You've been forced to go through a naked body scanner or they've groped you because
[03:45:37.880 --> 03:45:38.880]  you wouldn't.
[03:45:38.880 --> 03:45:39.880]  Right.
[03:45:39.880 --> 03:45:40.880]  What do you say to me?
[03:45:40.880 --> 03:45:44.800]  If you're the judge, I'm going to say, your honor, thank you very much for hearing my case.
[03:45:44.800 --> 03:45:47.780]  We need redress here because number one, I have a right to travel.
[03:45:47.780 --> 03:45:48.840]  That's an inalienable right.
[03:45:48.840 --> 03:45:50.960]  That doesn't have to be listed in the Bill of Rights.
[03:45:50.960 --> 03:45:52.280]  I have a right to travel.
[03:45:52.280 --> 03:45:56.840]  I have a right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.
[03:45:56.840 --> 03:46:00.000]  Now whoever is on the other side is going to say, well, this is reasonable.
[03:46:00.000 --> 03:46:01.120]  And that's what I'm going to say.
[03:46:01.120 --> 03:46:02.120]  Show me an instance.
[03:46:02.120 --> 03:46:05.960]  I know some people take their Cessnas and that very unfortunate event you had here in
[03:46:05.960 --> 03:46:09.760]  your town about a month ago, I'm talking about a commercial airline.
[03:46:09.760 --> 03:46:13.840]  We go to get on a plane to conduct business or to visit family.
[03:46:13.840 --> 03:46:15.600]  We don't go to blow things up.
[03:46:15.600 --> 03:46:21.160]  They have methods in place which have worked for decades and every time they haven't worked,
[03:46:21.160 --> 03:46:22.960]  it hasn't been one of us.
[03:46:22.960 --> 03:46:29.160]  It hasn't been a person who's born here, raised here, understands it's here.
[03:46:29.160 --> 03:46:33.320]  It's always been someone that doesn't necessarily connect with this country.
[03:46:33.320 --> 03:46:35.920]  And who's always above the law, like the illegals, killing everybody.
[03:46:35.920 --> 03:46:43.320]  But there's just this effort to squeeze us down with everybody else, show us to not
[03:46:43.320 --> 03:46:44.680]  show favoritism.
[03:46:44.680 --> 03:46:46.920]  I want favoritism.
[03:46:46.920 --> 03:46:50.160]  I'm a sovereign of this country and I want favoritism.
[03:46:50.160 --> 03:46:51.920]  I've got my American passport.
[03:46:51.920 --> 03:46:53.680]  I've got my driver's license.
[03:46:53.680 --> 03:46:56.520]  I've submitted to a lot of the things that I don't necessarily.
[03:46:56.520 --> 03:47:00.680]  And that's the fake liberalism is that like citizens are trash, everybody else is God.
[03:47:00.680 --> 03:47:01.680]  I don't understand.
[03:47:01.680 --> 03:47:03.080]  Government's God, illegals are God.
[03:47:03.080 --> 03:47:05.680]  I just flew out of the country to Italy about five months ago.
[03:47:05.680 --> 03:47:06.680]  I was welcomed.
[03:47:06.680 --> 03:47:10.040]  The gentleman asked me one question, stamped my passport and said, have a nice day.
[03:47:10.040 --> 03:47:15.920]  I try to get back into my own country and it's a four hour process of disrobing, opening
[03:47:15.920 --> 03:47:19.680]  all of your luggage, being questioned, and that's why our tourism is dying because people
[03:47:19.680 --> 03:47:20.680]  don't want to come here.
[03:47:20.680 --> 03:47:22.000]  They know a police state.
[03:47:22.000 --> 03:47:26.120]  And so you always ask the question, what's the real underlying policy?
[03:47:26.120 --> 03:47:31.240]  Is there is the underlying policy really to stop a citizen from committing a terrorist
[03:47:31.240 --> 03:47:32.760]  act on a plane?
[03:47:32.760 --> 03:47:33.760]  No.
[03:47:33.760 --> 03:47:39.040]  The real policy as you've exposed is to get us used to being treated like sheep, to get
[03:47:39.040 --> 03:47:45.120]  us used to being herded into a line and forced to put our hands up at our head down and
[03:47:45.120 --> 03:47:46.120]  photograph.
[03:47:46.120 --> 03:47:47.120]  Look at public schools.
[03:47:47.120 --> 03:47:48.120]  They do that everywhere.
[03:47:48.120 --> 03:47:49.120]  It's outrageous is what it is.
[03:47:49.120 --> 03:47:53.480]  So there always has to be an alternative to get to the degradation.
[03:47:53.480 --> 03:47:55.840]  That has to be reasonable too.
[03:47:55.840 --> 03:47:57.120]  What's wrong with the wand?
[03:47:57.120 --> 03:47:58.120]  I disrobe.
[03:47:58.120 --> 03:47:59.120]  I take my belt off.
[03:47:59.120 --> 03:48:00.120]  I take my shoes off.
[03:48:00.120 --> 03:48:01.120]  I take my jacket off.
[03:48:01.120 --> 03:48:02.120]  I got four buckets.
[03:48:02.120 --> 03:48:04.280]  All acts of submission.
[03:48:04.280 --> 03:48:08.960]  And then ultimately though, I still have to be completely patted down without problems.
[03:48:08.960 --> 03:48:11.920]  And I see them at the airport grabbing people's testicles.
[03:48:11.920 --> 03:48:15.560]  They've never done that to me, but I'm going to say get your hands off that.
[03:48:15.560 --> 03:48:17.240]  I'm not going to let them get close anymore.
[03:48:17.240 --> 03:48:19.960]  Now if I get shut down on a plane, I don't know what's going to happen.
[03:48:19.960 --> 03:48:20.960]  I'm going to miss a vacation.
[03:48:20.960 --> 03:48:21.960]  I'm going to be really upset.
[03:48:21.960 --> 03:48:24.880]  I'm going to miss a business meeting and have damage.
[03:48:24.880 --> 03:48:28.120]  But at some point, someone's going to have to go to the federal court.
[03:48:28.120 --> 03:48:33.760]  Now, this is a problem that I've had because I approach all my topics from a legal perspective.
[03:48:33.760 --> 03:48:39.520]  As sovereigns, we've set up our state and federal governments to have shared power.
[03:48:39.520 --> 03:48:42.920]  We need the judicial branch to start stepping up.
[03:48:42.920 --> 03:48:48.520]  I'm not here to criticize judges, but they need to step up.
[03:48:48.520 --> 03:48:50.120]  They're part of this fight.
[03:48:50.120 --> 03:48:52.760]  They're part of this movement, if you want to know.
[03:48:52.760 --> 03:48:55.040]  And they're getting promoted for being political whores.
[03:48:55.040 --> 03:48:57.280]  The citizens need to put pressure on them in the elections.
[03:48:57.280 --> 03:49:00.440]  They're pressurized to just treat everybody the same.
[03:49:00.440 --> 03:49:03.520]  They're pressurized to just get everybody through.
[03:49:03.520 --> 03:49:06.960]  I go to court every day, all day, Alex, every day, all day.
[03:49:06.960 --> 03:49:09.840]  And I see that the pressure is to prosecute.
[03:49:09.840 --> 03:49:11.440]  The pressure is to process.
[03:49:11.440 --> 03:49:12.800]  The pressure is to convict.
[03:49:12.800 --> 03:49:15.640]  The pressure is to convict and extract.
[03:49:15.640 --> 03:49:19.680]  We need the judicial people to start stepping up and saying, hey, I've got this black robe
[03:49:19.680 --> 03:49:20.680]  on for a reason.
[03:49:20.680 --> 03:49:26.640]  And that's to protect the people, not the government created by those people, the real
[03:49:26.640 --> 03:49:29.320]  people who have the sovereignty and their blood.
[03:49:29.320 --> 03:49:30.680]  Now that includes everybody.
[03:49:30.680 --> 03:49:32.160]  I'm not being exclusive here.
[03:49:32.160 --> 03:49:36.920]  I'm just saying, if you're part of this country, then you hold the power in your...
[03:49:36.920 --> 03:49:37.920]  Well, let's make a deal.
[03:49:37.920 --> 03:49:39.440]  Let's just say we're above the law like the illegals.
[03:49:39.440 --> 03:49:40.440]  No, no.
[03:49:40.440 --> 03:49:41.440]  I mean, that's unconstitutional.
[03:49:41.440 --> 03:49:43.920]  But I mean, that's what we're talking about here.
[03:49:43.920 --> 03:49:47.840]  Well, people ask me all the time when I start talking about sovereignty.
[03:49:47.840 --> 03:49:51.040]  People say, well, do you mean a sovereign can drive down the road 100 miles an hour?
[03:49:51.040 --> 03:49:54.200]  And my response is, a sovereign's not going to drive down the road 100 miles an hour.
[03:49:54.200 --> 03:49:55.840]  Besides, that endangers others.
[03:49:55.840 --> 03:49:57.520]  That endangers others, of course.
[03:49:57.520 --> 03:50:05.080]  So what I'm asking regular people, and I use that word people particularly, is to understand
[03:50:05.080 --> 03:50:09.160]  that it's not just glorified to be a king or queen.
[03:50:09.160 --> 03:50:10.800]  It holds enormous duty.
[03:50:10.800 --> 03:50:13.040]  It holds enormous responsibility.
[03:50:13.040 --> 03:50:17.800]  And despite the fact that we want to go watch football and we want to raise our kids in
[03:50:17.800 --> 03:50:18.800]  a fashion that we...
[03:50:18.800 --> 03:50:21.320]  If we're this powerful sovereign, we better act like it.
[03:50:21.320 --> 03:50:29.200]  We now have a call to arms, that may not mean guns and rifles, but whatever a person can
[03:50:29.200 --> 03:50:33.240]  do to get involved in the next city council race, next DA's...
[03:50:33.240 --> 03:50:37.320]  And we're not going to save the world individually or with one action, but it's that spirit of
[03:50:37.320 --> 03:50:45.320]  action in your community, teaching your children, having a neighborhood session or meetup, joining
[03:50:45.320 --> 03:50:51.920]  We Are Change, whatever it takes to just exercise your sovereignty, and in the end, it's about
[03:50:51.920 --> 03:50:56.120]  mass consciousness and information, because our biggest weapon is the dissemination of
[03:50:56.120 --> 03:50:57.120]  information.
[03:50:57.120 --> 03:51:00.840]  Jerry Fielder, stay there, final segment, key information, straight ahead, stay with
[03:51:00.840 --> 03:51:01.840]  us.
[03:51:01.840 --> 03:51:07.160]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters, thinking of calling a debt relief
[03:51:07.160 --> 03:51:08.160]  company?
[03:51:08.160 --> 03:51:09.160]  Don't.
[03:51:09.160 --> 03:51:12.000]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[03:51:12.000 --> 03:51:13.000]  Why pay?
[03:51:13.000 --> 03:51:18.160]  Because you can get their solution absolutely free, with New York Times bestselling author

[03:51:24.160 --> 03:51:25.160]  companies.
[03:51:25.160 --> 03:51:28.400]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[03:51:28.400 --> 03:51:29.400]  Here's Herb K.
[03:51:29.400 --> 03:51:33.520]  Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies, when I can give you the information you need
[03:51:33.520 --> 03:51:35.640]  to do it yourself for free.
[03:51:35.640 --> 03:51:40.080]  Herb K was right, his free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[03:51:40.080 --> 03:51:41.520]  What have you got to lose?
[03:51:41.520 --> 03:51:45.160]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money.

[03:51:53.600 --> 03:52:03.400]  That's 888-352-7726, 888-352-7726.
[03:52:03.400 --> 03:52:07.120]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:52:07.120 --> 03:52:10.280]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:52:10.280 --> 03:52:14.640]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[03:52:14.640 --> 03:52:15.640]  at home.
[03:52:15.640 --> 03:52:20.800]  I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are calling the
[03:52:20.800 --> 03:52:21.800]  shots.
[03:52:21.800 --> 03:52:26.640]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:52:26.640 --> 03:52:32.400]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel held
[03:52:32.400 --> 03:52:36.800]  bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:52:36.800 --> 03:52:39.200]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[03:52:39.200 --> 03:52:43.320]  They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:52:43.320 --> 03:52:48.720]  Today, it seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen
[03:52:48.720 --> 03:52:50.560]  a fall of the Republic.

[03:53:39.520 --> 03:53:40.520]  to serve as debt.
[03:53:40.520 --> 03:53:44.040]  This capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public
[03:53:44.040 --> 03:53:47.360]  currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?

[03:54:05.200 --> 03:54:08.320]  Final lawyer, Gary Fielder is our guest.
[03:54:08.320 --> 03:54:13.320]  Final segment, retransmission with Bob Chapman, Jesse Ventura, and of course, yours truly
[03:54:13.320 --> 03:54:17.040]  coming up on the infowars.com streams and on great AM and FM's everywhere.
[03:54:17.040 --> 03:54:21.400]  Don't forget the free iPhone app at infowars.com, if you don't have an iPhone, you can sit in
[03:54:21.400 --> 03:54:24.680]  the link to your friends and family, that's how we reach more people, that's activism
[03:54:24.680 --> 03:54:25.680]  right there.
[03:54:25.680 --> 03:54:29.420]  You see the police and all their royal uniforms, the government, the judges, they're telling
[03:54:29.420 --> 03:54:35.120]  you they're special, they're dressing like kings, they're wearing epaulets and jewels
[03:54:35.120 --> 03:54:40.040]  and signets of their power, but in America, the power flows from the people.
[03:54:40.040 --> 03:54:41.040]  We have to relearn that.
[03:54:41.040 --> 03:54:45.120]  Gary, we've got four minutes left, other key points you want to make, and if folks can't
[03:54:45.120 --> 03:54:49.160]  make a seminar tomorrow in Austin, you can look on his website for other places he's
[03:54:49.160 --> 03:54:50.160]  having the seminars.
[03:54:50.160 --> 03:54:51.160]  Go ahead.
[03:54:51.160 --> 03:54:52.160]  All right, thank you very much, Alex.
[03:54:52.160 --> 03:54:54.280]  Just a couple of final thoughts.
[03:54:54.280 --> 03:55:00.520]  In my opinion, it's unquestionable that after the Declaration of Independence, the people
[03:55:00.520 --> 03:55:05.240]  of the states were sovereign in each state constitution.
[03:55:05.240 --> 03:55:10.360]  When we signed the Treaty of Paris with Ben Franklin, John Jay, and John Adams, the sovereignty
[03:55:10.360 --> 03:55:17.160]  of King George III was bestowed upon the states, and so we often think of each state
[03:55:17.160 --> 03:55:22.800]  being sovereign, but as the constitution was drafted in a case very early on when John
[03:55:22.800 --> 03:55:28.480]  Jay, who signed the Treaty of Paris, was the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, he issued
[03:55:28.480 --> 03:55:32.960]  a ruling in Chisholm v. Georgia that said, although the Treaty of Paris bestowed the
[03:55:32.960 --> 03:55:37.320]  sovereignty onto the quote-unquote states, the states are the people.
[03:55:37.320 --> 03:55:41.360]  So even our states don't hold the quote-unquote sovereignty.
[03:55:41.360 --> 03:55:42.360]  We do.
[03:55:42.360 --> 03:55:43.880]  Yeah, and that's a fact.
[03:55:43.880 --> 03:55:45.120]  We don't have a king here.
[03:55:45.120 --> 03:55:48.720]  We don't have a king state or federal, and it's in our blood, so when we look at the
[03:55:48.720 --> 03:55:54.520]  constitution and we look at the preamble, it's we, the people, to ourselves and our
[03:55:54.520 --> 03:55:55.520]  posterity.
[03:55:55.520 --> 03:56:00.120]  So I'm not trying to limit sovereignty or who is in the people, but clearly, however
[03:56:00.120 --> 03:56:06.320]  you define the term posterity, if our relatives were on the land, we don't have to worry about
[03:56:06.320 --> 03:56:08.680]  who's sovereign and who's not sovereign.
[03:56:08.680 --> 03:56:10.200]  We definitely are.
[03:56:10.200 --> 03:56:15.120]  So instead of arguing about who's better or who's worse, I'm simply suggesting that
[03:56:15.120 --> 03:56:20.560]  if you know from tracing your family heritage that your family was on the land and they
[03:56:20.560 --> 03:56:24.480]  helped build this country, they were bestowed by the king.
[03:56:24.480 --> 03:56:28.480]  They had a direct title, sovereignty, direct title.
[03:56:28.480 --> 03:56:31.120]  So it's not an exclusive game.
[03:56:31.120 --> 03:56:33.000]  It's an inclusive game.
[03:56:33.000 --> 03:56:36.400]  But if you were bestowed with that sovereignty, then you're going to have to miss some of
[03:56:36.400 --> 03:56:37.400]  those football games.
[03:56:37.400 --> 03:56:39.400]  You're going to have to miss some of those movies.
[03:56:39.400 --> 03:56:40.400]  It's time.
[03:56:40.400 --> 03:56:41.720]  It's time now.
[03:56:41.720 --> 03:56:42.720]  Everybody's getting caught up.
[03:56:42.720 --> 03:56:43.720]  History is happening now.
[03:56:43.720 --> 03:56:44.840]  It's minute men time.
[03:56:44.840 --> 03:56:47.680]  It's minute women time and make no mistake about it.
[03:56:47.680 --> 03:56:53.640]  Even the Supreme Court cases which came up through the 18th century were inclusive, inclusive
[03:56:53.640 --> 03:56:54.640]  of women.
[03:56:54.640 --> 03:57:00.160]  Now, there are other issues that have to be resolved with regard to sovereignty, but that's
[03:57:00.160 --> 03:57:01.720]  on a more technical basis.
[03:57:01.720 --> 03:57:02.720]  People will learn more in the seminar.
[03:57:02.720 --> 03:57:06.760]  We're never going to have you back for an hour on the phone just on sovereignty.
[03:57:06.760 --> 03:57:08.320]  You wanted to talk about Obama briefly.
[03:57:08.320 --> 03:57:13.920]  Because briefly, because part of the sovereignty is knowing who you are, and in the process
[03:57:13.920 --> 03:57:20.120]  of knowing who you are, you read a couple of cases about what the term, quote unquote,
[03:57:20.120 --> 03:57:25.480]  citizen of the United States means, and what the term natural born citizen means.
[03:57:25.480 --> 03:57:33.160]  At the very limit, a natural born citizen is one who has at least both parents as United
[03:57:33.160 --> 03:57:34.640]  States citizens.
[03:57:34.640 --> 03:57:36.320]  Both parents could be naturalized.
[03:57:36.320 --> 03:57:40.600]  Both parents could be recent immigrants, but a natural born citizen is one born on the
[03:57:40.600 --> 03:57:41.600]  land.
[03:57:41.600 --> 03:57:42.840]  So let's forget about the birth certificate.
[03:57:42.840 --> 03:57:47.040]  Let's forget about the Hawaii thing and concede that with two parents.
[03:57:47.040 --> 03:57:48.040]  That's right.
[03:57:48.040 --> 03:57:50.720]  We shouldn't have a president whose both parents weren't born here.
[03:57:50.720 --> 03:57:54.640]  At least both parents have to be naturalized or themselves natural born.
[03:57:54.640 --> 03:57:59.640]  So with all due respect to Mr. Obama, he can't be the president of the United States because
[03:57:59.640 --> 03:58:01.440]  his father was a British citizen.
[03:58:01.440 --> 03:58:03.400]  Gary, you're a constitutional expert.
[03:58:03.400 --> 03:58:08.280]  I want to have you back on that subject and your overview for a full hour over the phone
[03:58:08.280 --> 03:58:09.280]  in the next few weeks.
[03:58:09.280 --> 03:58:10.280]  That sounds really good, Alex.
[03:58:10.280 --> 03:58:11.280]  Thank you so much.
[03:58:11.280 --> 03:58:12.680]  In fact, the producers are out there before you leave us.
[03:58:12.680 --> 03:58:13.680]  We'll set it up.
[03:58:13.680 --> 03:58:19.440]  8.30 tomorrow, sign in time at the AT&T event center at the University of Texas.
[03:58:19.440 --> 03:58:21.440]  My proud alma mater, 1980.
[03:58:21.440 --> 03:58:22.920]  And fire out your website one more time.
[03:58:22.920 --> 03:58:27.120]  Gigasup.net and legal status are us.com.
[03:58:27.120 --> 03:58:28.120]  Gary, great having you.
[03:58:28.120 --> 03:58:29.120]  Thank you.
[03:58:29.120 --> 03:58:30.120]  Rayvon, Alex.
[03:58:30.120 --> 03:58:31.120]  Rayvon, thank you.
[03:58:31.120 --> 03:58:32.120]  You bet.
[03:58:32.120 --> 03:58:33.520]  Okay, the mission starts now.
[03:58:33.520 --> 03:58:34.520]  Have a great weekend.
[03:58:34.520 --> 03:58:36.160]  I'm going to go in there and fight the new world order.
[03:58:36.160 --> 03:58:41.040]  Two new films coming up and one of them is already pre-selling at infowars.com, Invisible
[03:58:41.040 --> 03:58:42.040]  Empire.
[03:58:42.040 --> 03:58:46.640]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[03:58:46.640 --> 03:58:51.800]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[03:58:51.800 --> 03:58:53.200]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:58:53.200 --> 03:58:57.120]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage
[03:58:57.120 --> 03:58:58.760]  vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[03:58:58.760 --> 03:59:02.080]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable?
[03:59:02.080 --> 03:59:03.760]  And silver or gold?
[03:59:03.760 --> 03:59:04.760]  It's true.
[03:59:04.760 --> 03:59:07.720]  Seeds that all perform even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible
[03:59:07.720 --> 03:59:09.320]  that could even happen again.
[03:59:09.320 --> 03:59:13.920]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[03:59:13.920 --> 03:59:14.920]  seeds.
[03:59:14.920 --> 03:59:19.800]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense
[03:59:19.800 --> 03:59:21.680]  food for you and your family.
[03:59:21.680 --> 03:59:22.680]  And here's the best part.
[03:59:22.680 --> 03:59:27.000]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds
[03:59:27.000 --> 03:59:29.480]  to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[03:59:29.480 --> 03:59:32.720]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[03:59:32.720 --> 03:59:39.520]  That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[03:59:39.520 --> 03:59:43.640]  That's 877-327-0365.
[03:59:43.640 --> 03:59:48.520]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[03:59:48.520 --> 03:59:52.320]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[03:59:52.320 --> 03:59:56.160]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[03:59:56.160 --> 04:00:00.200]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
