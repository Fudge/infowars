[00:00:05.051 --> 00:00:09.873]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.873 --> 00:00:11.474]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.474 --> 00:00:13.034]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.034 --> 00:00:17.216]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.216 --> 00:00:21.257]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:35.962]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:35.962 --> 00:00:41.387]  Friday, the 19th day of March, 2010.
[00:00:41.387 --> 00:00:45.691]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Friday edition.
[00:00:45.691 --> 00:00:52.176]  Well, they're talking about even trying to pass the health care bill today or over the weekend or next week.
[00:00:52.176 --> 00:00:56.921]  And we're going to be talking a lot about exactly what is in the health care bill and how it's unconstitutional.
[00:00:58.251 --> 00:01:10.483]  and illegal and discriminatory on so many fronts and the types of draconian police state measures that are in the bill.
[00:01:10.483 --> 00:01:16.048]  Republicans assail IRS provision in health care bill.
[00:01:16.048 --> 00:01:20.633]  This is a vast expanse of power, congressman said.
[00:01:23.268 --> 00:01:31.954]  In the bill, it allows the IRS to take your paycheck or your refunds to make you buy health insurance.
[00:01:31.954 --> 00:01:33.855]  So they just take your money.
[00:01:33.855 --> 00:01:36.577]  This is the IRS minding you, running your life.
[00:01:36.577 --> 00:01:43.221]  This abusive, unaccountable collection agency for the private Federal Reserve, and that's why they're taking this money, is to fund the banks.
[00:01:44.830 --> 00:02:01.395]  I saw another report two days ago where they are now taking the major private pension funds with the CEOs, the government is, and having them invest that into the banking system.
[00:02:01.395 --> 00:02:08.697]  So that is coming up as well today.
[00:02:08.697 --> 00:02:13.579]  When we come back from break, I'm going to go over the different angles of the health care bill.
[00:02:15.757 --> 00:02:19.058]  38 state attorney generals are saying it's illegal.
[00:02:19.058 --> 00:02:24.541]  In fact, I heard the Texas Attorney General on KLBJ this morning talking about it.
[00:02:24.541 --> 00:02:25.221]  And I agree with him.
[00:02:25.221 --> 00:02:29.462]  I'm going to repeat some of the things he talked about.
[00:02:29.462 --> 00:02:31.063]  And then I've got news like this.
[00:02:31.063 --> 00:02:35.545]  Pentagon sees a threat from online muckrakers, New York Times.
[00:02:35.545 --> 00:02:37.525]  This came out yesterday.
[00:02:37.525 --> 00:02:41.227]  Saying, oh yes, they want to shut down people exposing the government.
[00:02:41.227 --> 00:02:44.128]  And that dovetails with cyber security bill introduced in the Senate.
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.221]  But don't worry, there's been a major change.
[00:02:47.221 --> 00:02:48.662]  This is a quote from Reuters.
[00:02:48.662 --> 00:02:54.144]  One major change to the bill is that the president would no longer have the power to shut down the internet unilaterally.
[00:02:54.144 --> 00:02:55.045]  Oh, great!
[00:02:55.045 --> 00:02:59.567]  But would have to work within the industry to draw up plans in the event of a national emergency.
[00:02:59.567 --> 00:03:04.289]  So it says, the president consults with who he wants, and then he has unlimited power.
[00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:06.650]  So, oh great, he can still shut it down whenever he wants.
[00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.011]  Just total tyranny.
[00:03:09.295 --> 00:03:22.525]  There's a CNET news article, Emergency Internet Control Bill gets a rewrite, but it goes on to report that it's, meet the new boss, same as the old boss, and they admit their target is people exposing government documents, 9-11 truth, you name it.
[00:03:22.525 --> 00:03:25.126]  Because we are killing them, politically.
[00:03:25.126 --> 00:03:27.148]  We are annihilating them.
[00:03:27.148 --> 00:03:29.950]  And to go ahead and try to start curtailing and shutting down the web.
[00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.432]  It's too late, crooks!
[00:03:32.432 --> 00:03:37.956]  Genie's out of the bottle, cat's out of the bag, horse already left the barn, train already left the station,
[00:03:39.244 --> 00:03:54.031]  Humpty Dumpty already fell off the wall, and all the King's horses, and all the King's men, and all the King's media, and brainwashing, and propaganda, and Homeland Security, and MIAC reports, and Southern Poverty Law Center, and ADL can't put your stinkin' tyranny back together again.
[00:03:54.031 --> 00:03:57.233]  It is the beginning of the end for you, you murdering bastards.
[00:03:57.233 --> 00:03:58.774]  Excuse me.
[00:03:58.774 --> 00:03:59.434]  I apologize.
[00:03:59.434 --> 00:04:00.354]  I'm gonna control myself.
[00:04:00.354 --> 00:04:02.395]  I'm very upset about the healthcare situation.
[00:04:02.395 --> 00:04:03.996]  That dovetails, though, with this.
[00:04:03.996 --> 00:04:07.438]  Bill automatically allows Power Company to regulate your home temperature.
[00:04:08.544 --> 00:04:10.265]  That's what they did in California.
[00:04:10.265 --> 00:04:11.446]  Texas is doing it.
[00:04:11.446 --> 00:04:14.509]  Utah's got a bill to do it.
[00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:18.772]  Every state in the union, they're going to decide how hot and how cold your house is.
[00:04:18.772 --> 00:04:20.294]  You want to be a prisoner?
[00:04:20.294 --> 00:04:22.215]  You want to live in a giant prison?
[00:04:22.215 --> 00:04:24.837]  In a prison, the warden controls the temp.
[00:04:24.837 --> 00:04:28.741]  Well, you a prisoner.
[00:04:28.741 --> 00:04:31.963]  And then Aaron Dykes, Rob Dewey wants to interview Lord Monckton in D.C.
[00:04:33.226 --> 00:04:35.567]  Had an unbelievable run-in with TSA.
[00:04:35.567 --> 00:04:39.429]  I'm gonna get Dykes in here to talk about it later.
[00:04:39.429 --> 00:04:43.331]  It's just... This is getting really scary, folks.
[00:04:43.331 --> 00:04:46.793]  Wait till you hear what happened to Dykes.
[00:04:46.793 --> 00:04:51.496]  It just goes to every point we've been making.
[00:04:51.496 --> 00:04:53.477]  We're gonna break down a lot of key info coming up.
[00:04:55.905 --> 00:05:00.287]  Right here on the one and only GCN Radio Network, I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com.
[00:05:00.287 --> 00:05:01.587]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:05:01.587 --> 00:05:07.169]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:12.191]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:05:12.191 --> 00:05:17.773]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:05:17.773 --> 00:05:22.455]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:05:22.975 --> 00:05:30.098]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:05:30.098 --> 00:05:31.219]  And here's the best part.
[00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:37.902]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:05:37.902 --> 00:05:41.103]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:05:41.103 --> 00:05:44.205]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:05:44.205 --> 00:05:44.425]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:05:52.108 --> 00:05:56.951]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:05:56.951 --> 00:06:02.213]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:06:02.213 --> 00:06:06.215]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:06:06.215 --> 00:06:09.477]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:06:09.477 --> 00:06:10.878]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:06:11.787 --> 00:06:14.268]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:06:14.268 --> 00:06:20.650]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:26.192]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:06:26.192 --> 00:06:35.836]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:06:35.956 --> 00:06:38.298]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:06:38.298 --> 00:06:39.880]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.342]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:06:42.342 --> 00:06:44.464]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:06:44.464 --> 00:06:49.629]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:58.737]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:07:01.192 --> 00:07:06.833]  George Washington said, Government is not reason, it is not eloquence, it is force, like fire.
[00:07:06.833 --> 00:07:09.414]  It is a dangerous servant and a fearful master.
[00:07:09.414 --> 00:07:15.255]  America's government is no longer the servant of the people and the protector of our liberty, but has become that fearful master.
[00:07:15.255 --> 00:07:21.176]  We the people must understand the nature of this government gone awry if we are to be successful in saving our country.
[00:07:21.176 --> 00:07:27.977]  America is being deliberately destroyed by a cabal of international gangsters so that she can be forced into subjugation to a one world government.
[00:07:28.257 --> 00:07:28.717]  We're good to go.
[00:07:58.097 --> 00:08:01.539]  Spending bills must originate in the House of Representatives.
[00:08:01.539 --> 00:08:02.359]  That's the Constitution.
[00:08:02.359 --> 00:08:02.679]  That's law.
[00:08:02.679 --> 00:08:03.640]  If not, you have a tyranny.
[00:08:27.168 --> 00:08:34.711]  But the bill they're voting on is a Senate version without a full review and vote in the House.
[00:08:34.711 --> 00:08:41.114]  And so they're just going around to Democrats saying, do you agree to the changes without an official vote?
[00:08:41.114 --> 00:08:46.136]  So none of them politically have to go on the line for this.
[00:08:46.136 --> 00:08:47.877]  But there's another big issue here.
[00:08:48.916 --> 00:08:55.740]  And that's why 38 and growing, told us 39, but this morning it's 38 Attorney Generals.
[00:08:55.740 --> 00:09:03.545]  I heard Abbott on News Radio 590 this morning, the Texas Attorney General, and he was explaining it in crystal clear terms.
[00:09:03.545 --> 00:09:10.810]  That if the government can force you to buy something via the Commerce Clause, which they've never before done, you are a slave.
[00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:13.552]  And they can make you go out and buy an electric car.
[00:09:14.774 --> 00:09:16.875]  To, quote, prop up General Motors.
[00:09:16.875 --> 00:09:20.857]  They can just unilaterally seize your bank accounts.
[00:09:20.857 --> 00:09:24.139]  They can do whatever they want.
[00:09:24.139 --> 00:09:30.322]  And, you know, Rush Limbaugh yesterday said this was treason, that this was a, quote, overthrow of the U.S.
[00:09:30.322 --> 00:09:31.083]  Constitution.
[00:09:31.083 --> 00:09:39.027]  I have the quotes here, that this was a rebellion against America, this was illegal, that these people are criminals and should be arrested.
[00:09:39.027 --> 00:09:40.948]  I've never heard Limbaugh talk like this.
[00:09:43.171 --> 00:09:50.093]  But Limbaugh, where were you with the Patriot Act, which they now admit is used in non-terror-related cases against the American people?
[00:09:50.093 --> 00:09:52.594]  Where were you on torture?
[00:09:52.594 --> 00:09:58.555]  Where were you on our own military having the Patriot Act used against them?
[00:09:58.555 --> 00:10:01.716]  Where were you during the warrantless wiretapping?
[00:10:01.716 --> 00:10:09.058]  See, you can't just violate one part of the Constitution and Bill of Rights when you like it, and then get mad when somebody else does it.
[00:10:10.131 --> 00:10:11.852]  And that's my main issue.
[00:10:11.852 --> 00:10:13.793]  That's the whole point of this radio show.
[00:10:13.793 --> 00:10:22.617]  We have a lawless, criminal, corporate group that has bought off most of the state-level politicians and almost all of the feds.
[00:10:22.617 --> 00:10:33.662]  Those that they can't buy off die in mysterious plane accidents or their sexual transgressions with hookers or whatever are brought out.
[00:10:33.662 --> 00:10:36.843]  The system destroys anyone at the highest level.
[00:10:36.843 --> 00:10:39.004]  So people say, well, I might as well just get bought off then.
[00:10:41.104 --> 00:10:50.826]  And I've got news reports where the majority of federal employees aren't even paying their taxes, or all of their taxes, and they're not enforced against.
[00:10:50.826 --> 00:10:55.908]  And that dovetails with all over the country, software, license plate reading cameras.
[00:10:55.908 --> 00:11:00.089]  The police and bureaucrats, federal and state, are exempt.
[00:11:00.089 --> 00:11:02.249]  Over a million license plates are exempt.
[00:11:02.249 --> 00:11:03.830]  The scanners cannot even read them.
[00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:06.670]  There's a default block in California.
[00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:08.111]  It was over a million two years ago.
[00:11:08.111 --> 00:11:09.131]  I don't know what it is now.
[00:11:09.131 --> 00:11:09.791]  It's always growing.
[00:11:12.213 --> 00:11:19.998]  And if a bureaucrat doesn't like you, they just put you in a database and you can't have a job, you can't fly, you can't do anything, and that's in this bill.
[00:11:19.998 --> 00:11:29.705]  You don't get insurance, no job, the IRS takes your paycheck, takes your tax refund, because the news is reporting, oh, they can take your tax refund and keep it.
[00:11:29.705 --> 00:11:32.347]  But I read the bill, it actually says they can do whatever they want.
[00:11:32.347 --> 00:11:36.570]  No judge, no jury, they just grab your account.
[00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:38.872]  And that dovetails with Aaron Dyke and Rob Dube,
[00:11:41.727 --> 00:11:58.043]  On the East Coast, they went to interview Lord Monckton for an upcoming film, the next fall, The Republic, and the TSA came over to them and said, what are you doing with these cameras?
[00:11:58.043 --> 00:12:05.770]  And got in their face and said, I can make sure you never get to travel again, never get to fly nothing.
[00:12:07.386 --> 00:12:09.428]  And was just on an incredible power trip.
[00:12:09.428 --> 00:12:10.488]  That's Nazi Germany.
[00:12:10.488 --> 00:12:13.851]  Well, first they said certain groups couldn't.
[00:12:13.851 --> 00:12:16.893]  They always pick an unpopular minority to test it out on.
[00:12:16.893 --> 00:12:20.976]  Muslims, cave dwellers, supposedly from Afghanistan.
[00:12:20.976 --> 00:12:25.499]  But the real targeting is against the general public.
[00:12:25.499 --> 00:12:30.583]  In Nazi Germany it was communists, Jews, Seventh-day Adventists.
[00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:32.885]  First you couldn't have your business, then you had to
[00:12:33.976 --> 00:12:36.438]  Move out of your home for your safety.
[00:12:36.438 --> 00:12:37.759]  You weren't allowed to work.
[00:12:37.759 --> 00:12:39.080]  You weren't allowed to travel.
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:42.622]  You had to have a special identification marking you as that.
[00:12:42.622 --> 00:12:44.104]  And that's exactly what this is now.
[00:12:44.104 --> 00:12:50.588]  This TSA people just walked up and said, look buddy, you'll never travel again.
[00:12:50.588 --> 00:12:53.611]  And started laughing.
[00:12:53.611 --> 00:12:55.392]  But Aaron really stood up to him.
[00:12:55.392 --> 00:12:57.954]  Started rolling the camera when the guy did this.
[00:12:57.954 --> 00:12:59.755]  So he put together a YouTube video of that.
[00:12:59.755 --> 00:13:00.796]  And Aaron has a lot of courage.
[00:13:02.061 --> 00:13:04.603]  I don't even tell them when they're flying to stand up against these people.
[00:13:04.603 --> 00:13:06.984]  I tell them, you know, it's your own personal decision.
[00:13:06.984 --> 00:13:11.627]  But he stood up against the IRS commissioner in Geithner and got that go-to-hell look.
[00:13:11.627 --> 00:13:17.711]  Then they sick their goons on him afterwards to just go to a press conference and ask him a question about the $23 trillion.
[00:13:17.711 --> 00:13:22.614]  Aaron used the old, seven-month-old number from Bloomberg of $23.7 trillion.
[00:13:22.614 --> 00:13:28.098]  It was over $28 trillion three months ago.
[00:13:28.098 --> 00:13:29.179]  These are thugs!
[00:13:29.179 --> 00:13:30.820]  I mean, this is what it's like to be a slave.
[00:13:31.513 --> 00:13:39.076]  We're now learning this, and it looks like they're going to get the bill through.
[00:13:39.076 --> 00:13:48.359]  They're going to have the Democrats not vote on the bill itself, but dissenting votes, change their vote, and deem.
[00:13:48.359 --> 00:13:53.140]  Never before done on a spending bill.
[00:13:53.140 --> 00:14:01.103]  Deeming can be done for, oh yeah, I support that October is end family violence month.
[00:14:02.859 --> 00:14:11.341]  Or yes, I'll vote with you that November is Iowa corn month.
[00:14:11.341 --> 00:14:13.762]  I mean, they literally have that.
[00:14:13.762 --> 00:14:19.043]  If it's a non-binding resolution, that's just a sense of the House, a sense of the Senate.
[00:14:19.043 --> 00:14:21.384]  I mean, this is truly illegal.
[00:14:21.384 --> 00:14:26.885]  And even McCafferty on CNN said that it borders on unconstitutional.
[00:14:26.885 --> 00:14:28.485]  And many law scholars are saying illegal.
[00:14:28.485 --> 00:14:30.286]  No, it's all illegal.
[00:14:32.606 --> 00:14:37.369]  And this sets an amazing precedent.
[00:14:37.369 --> 00:14:49.518]  Now, they said six months ago that it was unstoppable and was going to pass, and they said that four months ago and two months ago, and all along, they didn't have the votes they needed.
[00:14:51.343 --> 00:14:53.665]  to pass this really draconian Senate version.
[00:14:53.665 --> 00:14:55.346]  It's even worse than the House.
[00:14:55.346 --> 00:15:02.230]  And so now they're just going to say that it's legal for them to pass the Senate version without it originating in the House.
[00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:04.132]  I mean, it's just unspeakable.
[00:15:04.132 --> 00:15:19.962]  And then they selectively enforce on states where certain states don't have to opt into all the rules and unions, they get a, only certain unions get to keep their quote Cadillac healthcare, which isn't Cadillac at all.
[00:15:19.962 --> 00:15:21.143]  You certainly pay for it.
[00:15:22.267 --> 00:15:26.952]  And then yeah, you get no deductible.
[00:15:26.952 --> 00:15:28.854]  I think I've got like a $5,000 deductible.
[00:15:28.854 --> 00:15:30.135]  I've just got mediocre insurance.
[00:15:30.135 --> 00:15:36.823]  But the point is that if I wanted to pay more and not have a deductible, I paid for it.
[00:15:36.823 --> 00:15:40.727]  I mean, I made a deal with whoever I work for, if I work for a union or a big company.
[00:15:43.663 --> 00:15:50.385]  But I'm not allowed to do that, and what this does is set the precedent for government to do whatever it wants, but the IRS provision alone.
[00:15:50.385 --> 00:15:54.666]  I mean, Obama promised you during the campaign, this is one promise he's keeping.
[00:15:54.666 --> 00:15:56.466]  He's broken every other promise.
[00:15:56.466 --> 00:16:09.509]  I'll end torture, I'll end secret arrest, I won't have signing statements, I'll give you five days to read the bills, I won't hire a lobbyist, I'll get us out of Iraq immediately, on and on and on.
[00:16:09.509 --> 00:16:11.150]  Of course he was going to betray you.
[00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:12.450]  Look at all the big money supporting him.
[00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:19.987]  And if he lost, it didn't matter, the same big money owned McCain.
[00:16:19.987 --> 00:16:22.410]  But one promise he said is, we're gonna fine you.
[00:16:23.871 --> 00:16:26.152]  If you don't get insurance and now they're not just going to fine you.
[00:16:26.152 --> 00:16:31.193]  The idea of a fine says there's some court or some due process.
[00:16:31.193 --> 00:16:52.238]  They're going to have the IRS that's building new command centers all over the country like warts popping up on the face of the nation to now be involved in your paycheck every two weeks and to monitor you and to control your health care and to start taking your refunds and your tax money and slapping
[00:16:54.204 --> 00:17:02.709]  Leans on your bank accounts and see now they're trying to phase out cash and make businesses have instant transfer, make you have a bank account to have a job so they can take it!
[00:17:02.709 --> 00:17:06.611]  It's already like that in many areas of Europe.
[00:17:06.611 --> 00:17:16.717]  Everything you do tracked, everything you do traced, your medical records given to whoever wants them by the government, your blood taken at birth, police taking blood at warrantless checkpoints everywhere.
[00:17:19.048 --> 00:17:27.936]  And coming up, Bill automatically allows Power Company to regulate your home temperature, KSL, out of Salt Lake City.
[00:17:27.936 --> 00:17:30.979]  And they don't even need a stinking bill in California or Texas.
[00:17:30.979 --> 00:17:33.321]  They just come put them on your house or business.
[00:17:33.321 --> 00:17:34.682]  Our business got one last year.
[00:17:34.682 --> 00:17:37.144]  They don't ask.
[00:17:37.144 --> 00:17:41.088]  And they openly are announcing, we are going to control your power.
[00:17:42.139 --> 00:17:50.570]  At first they said a few years ago, oh, if there's a power shortage in the peak time of the summer, we might turn your thermostat, you know, from 75 up to 80.
[00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:56.979]  And now they just say, no, uh, we're going to monitor you and charge you premiums for using too much energy.
[00:17:56.979 --> 00:17:59.723]  And we may just turn it off because you are a prisoner.
[00:18:01.015 --> 00:18:04.017]  There was that big report about studies of the U.S.
[00:18:04.017 --> 00:18:10.140]  and England, how pupils are surveilled and controlled, just like someone in a medium-security prison.
[00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:11.661]  Well, of course!
[00:18:11.661 --> 00:18:13.883]  Prison planet!
[00:18:13.883 --> 00:18:15.283]  Prison planet!
[00:18:15.283 --> 00:18:17.084]  Technocracy!
[00:18:17.084 --> 00:18:19.666]  A scientific, technocratic elite.
[00:18:19.666 --> 00:18:23.068]  What did Eisenhower warn you about, hard to believe, 50 years ago?
[00:18:23.068 --> 00:18:23.748]  50 years ago!
[00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:33.492]  And he was for real.
[00:18:33.492 --> 00:18:36.854]  Somebody dropped a book or something and it made a pop noise.
[00:18:36.854 --> 00:18:42.339]  If you watch the unedited TV, Farewell Address, and he jerks with fear.
[00:18:42.339 --> 00:18:48.705]  Just like Oliver North, somebody slams a door when he's testifying before Congress and he ducks and jumps down.
[00:18:48.705 --> 00:18:53.989]  Because he knew they could kill him any minute.
[00:18:53.989 --> 00:18:56.792]  For all the cocaine dealing.
[00:18:56.792 --> 00:18:57.973]  He was up there taking the fall.
[00:18:59.232 --> 00:19:04.856]  Or the FEMA camp plans and the narcotics trafficking and kind of like G. Gordon Liddy for Nixon.
[00:19:04.856 --> 00:19:07.158]  But still, he jumps down.
[00:19:07.158 --> 00:19:08.078]  You ever seen that?
[00:19:08.078 --> 00:19:15.924]  I mean, he's in a congressional hearing and the door slams and he gets under the desk.
[00:19:15.924 --> 00:19:17.285]  That's what Eisenhower did.
[00:19:17.285 --> 00:19:17.625]  Whoa!
[00:19:17.625 --> 00:19:22.889]  Oh, I'm going to warn you about a technocratic police state takeover?
[00:19:22.889 --> 00:19:26.451]  And then he hears a slam door, a book drop, you hear like a bang.
[00:19:31.186 --> 00:19:33.147]  And now you're in it.
[00:19:33.147 --> 00:19:35.268]  And they're tapping your water with poison.
[00:19:35.268 --> 00:19:38.909]  They're spiking your food.
[00:19:38.909 --> 00:19:45.712]  And all the petty thugs that work for the system, their paychecks just get bigger and bigger and they love drinking the poison, love giving their kids the shots.
[00:19:45.712 --> 00:19:48.693]  They believe in the system and they're all going to hell.
[00:19:48.693 --> 00:19:50.414]  Dragging us straight to hell with them.
[00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:53.801]  Turning this world into hell.
[00:19:53.801 --> 00:19:55.663]  I'll break down the health care bill.
[00:19:55.663 --> 00:19:59.466]  Ohio Democrat flips the yes on health care bill.
[00:19:59.466 --> 00:20:00.967]  They only need one more.
[00:20:00.967 --> 00:20:02.748]  Great news for pure water lovers.
[00:20:02.748 --> 00:20:05.590]  The Big Berkey Water Filter is available once again.
[00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:09.133]  And stay tuned to hear about a valuable offer from Berkey Water Filters.
[00:20:09.133 --> 00:20:12.335]  Choosing the right water purification system can be a daunting task.
[00:20:12.555 --> 00:20:17.039]  That's why BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com shows you a cost and benefit comparison.
[00:20:17.039 --> 00:20:22.064]  The Berkey Water Filter is economical, with a single set of filters that can last for 5 to 10 years.
[00:20:22.064 --> 00:20:26.268]  Berkey Water Filters are healthy and far superior to other filtration systems.
[00:20:26.268 --> 00:20:31.413]  They remove harmful pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, and unhealthy chemicals like chlorine.
[00:20:31.413 --> 00:20:37.599]  And Berkey Water Filter systems are powerful enough to purify both treated and untreated water, like stagnant ponds.
[00:20:37.859 --> 00:20:38.279]  I think so.
[00:21:02.336 --> 00:21:06.363]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:21:06.363 --> 00:21:09.608]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:21:09.608 --> 00:21:11.031]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[00:21:11.733 --> 00:21:14.414]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:21:14.414 --> 00:21:20.796]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:21:20.796 --> 00:21:25.978]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:21:25.978 --> 00:21:35.961]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:21:36.081 --> 00:21:38.422]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:21:38.422 --> 00:21:40.023]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:21:40.023 --> 00:21:42.483]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:21:42.483 --> 00:21:44.604]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:21:44.604 --> 00:21:49.746]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:21:49.746 --> 00:21:58.869]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:22:00.879 --> 00:22:07.543]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:22:07.543 --> 00:22:15.669]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:22:15.669 --> 00:22:23.834]  Is this a flaw of free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:22:23.834 --> 00:22:28.597]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:22:28.917 --> 00:22:34.141]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:22:34.141 --> 00:22:38.484]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:22:38.484 --> 00:22:39.585]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:39.585 --> 00:22:44.089]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:22:44.089 --> 00:22:48.992]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[00:22:48.992 --> 00:22:51.974]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[00:22:51.974 --> 00:22:53.616]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:56.798 --> 00:23:00.599]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:00.599 --> 00:23:01.179]  Fact.
[00:23:01.179 --> 00:23:02.540]  Four million people in the U.S.
[00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:04.660]  have hepatitis C due to liver damage.
[00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:05.180]  Fact.
[00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:08.861]  Cirrhosis of the liver is the eighth leading cause of death among Americans.
[00:23:08.861 --> 00:23:09.481]  Fact.
[00:23:09.481 --> 00:23:14.983]  Alcohol, many prescription drugs, food additives, pesticides, and environmental toxins damage the liver.
[00:23:14.983 --> 00:23:15.603]  Fact.
[00:23:15.603 --> 00:23:19.444]  One in ten Americans is or has been affected by liver or gallbladder disease.
[00:23:19.804 --> 00:23:20.624]  We're good to go!
[00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:45.193]  Don't wait to protect your liver.
[00:23:45.193 --> 00:23:47.075]  Visit us at ResearchedHerbs.com or call 1-800-973-1486.
[00:23:47.075 --> 00:23:48.397]  That's 1-800-973-1486 or go to ResearchedHerbs.com.
[00:23:48.397 --> 00:23:49.599]  All the goodness with none of the side effects.
[00:24:12.167 --> 00:24:21.134]  Representative John Boccheri of Ohio is switching his vote to yes on President Obama's health care overall.
[00:24:21.134 --> 00:24:32.163]  They're just one vote shy of the 216 needed for passage where they just agree in the House to the Senate bill without bringing it into conference.
[00:24:32.163 --> 00:24:33.704]  Of course Dennis Kucinich on
[00:24:35.051 --> 00:24:43.734]  Tuesday flipped his vote after talking about how the health care bill raised taxes and cut Medicare and Medicaid.
[00:24:43.734 --> 00:24:51.477]  I mean he's a supposedly a real socialist and so he said this is a ripoff to the insurance company and banks.
[00:24:51.477 --> 00:24:59.580]  And it's also criminal and unconstitutional and the insurance companies wrote it but had their minions out saying that they were against it.
[00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:01.401]  Even the Wall Street Journal has reported on that.
[00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:09.865]  And so there is one more person, Shuler, undecided on health care bill.
[00:25:09.865 --> 00:25:11.767]  Representative Shuler.
[00:25:11.767 --> 00:25:18.011]  The leaders in the House of Representatives make their final push towards a possible vote on the health care overhaul bill this weekend.
[00:25:18.011 --> 00:25:25.757]  The 11th district representative, Heath Shuler, has yet to declare whether he's on board.
[00:25:25.757 --> 00:25:31.942]  So it's important to contact that individual.
[00:25:35.606 --> 00:25:37.387]  There's another reporter out of the AP.
[00:25:37.387 --> 00:25:38.427]  Cornhusker out.
[00:25:38.427 --> 00:25:39.587]  More deals in.
[00:25:39.587 --> 00:25:43.268]  Healthcare bill gives special treatment.
[00:25:43.268 --> 00:25:48.710]  We're going to break more of that down coming up, but I wanted to mention this.
[00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:55.132]  Failed banks may get pension fund backing as FDIC seeks more funds.
[00:25:57.028 --> 00:26:03.390]  This is out of business week and they changed the law six years ago where companies can take your pension funds.
[00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:06.070]  Well, now it's to be given to the foreign banks.
[00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:06.930]  That is coming up.
[00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:09.071]  In fact, guys, will you print me a printer friendly?
[00:26:09.071 --> 00:26:10.691]  Because this one cut off part of the article.
[00:26:10.691 --> 00:26:13.652]  Thank you.
[00:26:13.652 --> 00:26:15.412]  And I want to be able to cover that coming back.
[00:26:15.412 --> 00:26:21.634]  But right now, let's go to the McCafferty file with Wolf Blitzer.
[00:26:23.055 --> 00:26:26.681]  I guess a blind hog does occasionally find acorns.
[00:26:26.681 --> 00:26:28.704]  Broken clocks are right twice a day.
[00:26:28.704 --> 00:26:33.853]  He comes out and says it's beyond sleazy not having a full vote.
[00:26:33.853 --> 00:26:34.234]  Here it is.
[00:26:36.909 --> 00:26:39.870]  Get right to Jack Cafferty for the Cafferty File, Jack.
[00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:44.933]  Just when you think you've seen it all in Washington, along comes something like this.
[00:26:44.933 --> 00:26:51.736]  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi may try to pass the controversial health care reform bill without making members vote on it.
[00:26:51.736 --> 00:26:53.377]  Simply unbelievable.
[00:26:53.377 --> 00:27:05.703]  Pelosi says she might use a procedural tactic where the House will vote on the package of fixes to the Senate bill, and then that vote would signify that lawmakers, quote, deem the health care bill to be passed.
[00:27:06.403 --> 00:27:09.306]  Politically speaking, this is beyond sleazy.
[00:27:09.306 --> 00:27:17.215]  It's meant to protect House Democrats, who are all running for re-election in November, from having to make a tough vote, up or down, on health care reform.
[00:27:17.215 --> 00:27:23.482]  Pelosi says of this process, quote, I like it because people don't have to vote on the Senate bill, unquote.
[00:27:24.142 --> 00:27:27.723]  In Nancy Pelosi's world, accountability is a dirty word.
[00:27:27.723 --> 00:27:39.127]  The Senate bill, of course, contains many provisions that are unpopular among some House Democrats, including language on abortion funding and taxes on high-cost so-called Cadillac insurance plans.
[00:27:39.127 --> 00:27:48.471]  This tactic has been used in the past, but never, never for something as big and important as the $900 billion healthcare reform bill.
[00:27:48.471 --> 00:27:48.691]  Never.
[00:27:49.211 --> 00:27:51.973]  Republicans are jumping all over this, rightfully so.
[00:27:51.973 --> 00:27:57.436]  They're painting it as a way for Democrats to avoid taking responsibility, which is exactly what it is.
[00:27:57.436 --> 00:28:00.058]  Some even suggest it's unconstitutional.
[00:28:00.058 --> 00:28:05.821]  Meanwhile, President Obama is campaigning relentlessly, calling on lawmakers to pass health care reform.
[00:28:05.821 --> 00:28:08.423]  Quote, I want some courage.
[00:28:08.423 --> 00:28:10.184]  I want us to do the right thing.
[00:28:10.184 --> 00:28:11.064]  Unquote.
[00:28:11.064 --> 00:28:18.129]  Well, the irony here is that if Nancy Pelosi gets her way, it won't take much courage at all on the part of our so-called representatives.
[00:28:18.129 --> 00:28:18.389]  Will it?
[00:28:19.029 --> 00:28:20.190]  Here's the question.
[00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:25.354]  Should Nancy Pelosi be allowed to push health care reform through the House without a vote?
[00:28:25.354 --> 00:28:28.116]  Go to CNN.com slash Cafferty File.
[00:28:28.116 --> 00:28:29.918]  Post a comment on my blog.
[00:28:29.918 --> 00:28:30.458]  Both.
[00:28:30.458 --> 00:28:35.862]  We're learning a lot about reconciliation, about deeming bills passed into law.
[00:28:35.862 --> 00:28:38.404]  We're getting a little civics lesson out there, aren't we, Jack?
[00:28:38.404 --> 00:28:41.187]  We're learning a lot more about lack of political guts.
[00:28:41.827 --> 00:28:44.930]  Yeah, but you and I know that's been around for a while, right?
[00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:48.794]  Not quite in this obnoxious form, or noxious form.
[00:28:48.794 --> 00:28:50.496]  This reeks.
[00:28:50.496 --> 00:28:52.237]  Jack Cafferty telling it the way it is.
[00:28:52.237 --> 00:28:53.418]  Jack, thank you.
[00:28:53.418 --> 00:28:55.260]  Well, not quite.
[00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:57.542]  He says maybe unconstitutional, clearly is.
[00:28:58.323 --> 00:29:01.106]  And you've got Wolf going, well, it's been like that for a long time.
[00:29:01.106 --> 00:29:03.928]  See, yeah, we've been spying without warrants for a long time.
[00:29:03.928 --> 00:29:06.911]  Yeah, the government's been shipping narcotics in for a long time.
[00:29:06.911 --> 00:29:08.913]  Yeah, we've been building FEMA cams for a long time.
[00:29:08.913 --> 00:29:13.317]  We've been starting fake wars and lying about WMDs for a long time.
[00:29:13.317 --> 00:29:16.961]  And, yeah, the banks have been robbing you for a long time.
[00:29:16.961 --> 00:29:17.742]  Look at Mexico.
[00:29:17.742 --> 00:29:23.267]  Look at other third world countries where their ruling elite get bought off by foreign banks and sell their people out to slavery.
[00:29:24.121 --> 00:29:25.781]  They get away with it.
[00:29:25.781 --> 00:29:29.162]  And they're trying to get away with it here.
[00:29:29.162 --> 00:29:32.963]  And they don't care if Obama has the lowest approval rating ever.
[00:29:32.963 --> 00:29:34.723]  They don't care if Congress does.
[00:29:34.723 --> 00:29:42.805]  They are going for broke because they believe they have a military-industrial complex in place that will protect them from the people.
[00:29:42.805 --> 00:29:48.126]  And they're going in trying to block the people from taking the state's backs right now, calling us terrorists.
[00:29:48.126 --> 00:29:49.646]  No, you are the terrorists.
[00:29:51.055 --> 00:29:54.979]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.979 --> 00:30:00.564]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:30:24.246 --> 00:30:26.408]  That's buy three, get one free.
[00:30:26.408 --> 00:30:29.311]  They'll take orders from now until March 22nd.
[00:30:29.311 --> 00:30:36.879]  The following week, they'll produce huge runs of the pre-ordered food, passing the savings to you in this buy three, get one free program.
[00:30:37.279 --> 00:30:40.162]  Folks, this is the best chance to stock up you'll ever see.

[00:31:02.012 --> 00:31:06.038]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:31:06.038 --> 00:31:09.282]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:31:09.282 --> 00:31:10.704]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[00:31:11.408 --> 00:31:14.091]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:31:14.091 --> 00:31:20.477]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:31:20.477 --> 00:31:26.022]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:31:26.022 --> 00:31:35.651]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:31:35.771 --> 00:31:38.113]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:31:38.113 --> 00:31:39.694]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:31:39.694 --> 00:31:42.156]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:31:42.156 --> 00:31:44.278]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:31:44.278 --> 00:31:49.442]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:31:49.442 --> 00:31:54.385]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:53.300]  Make sure.
[00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:53.900]  Hands go.
[00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:54.220]  Wow!
[00:32:54.220 --> 00:33:05.323]  Freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose.
[00:33:05.323 --> 00:33:06.983]  Nothing.
[00:33:06.983 --> 00:33:11.144]  I mean nothing, honey, if it ain't free.
[00:33:16.246 --> 00:33:17.466]  We are back live, my friends.
[00:33:17.466 --> 00:33:20.067]  They know that they're pushing you into a corner.
[00:33:20.067 --> 00:33:26.389]  They know that they're setting us up to have nothing to lose.
[00:33:39.926 --> 00:33:43.987]  That's why they're preparing for terror attacks, citizen rebellions everywhere.
[00:33:43.987 --> 00:34:02.971]  They're demonizing armed citizens while creating militia-oid counterfeits of the Constitution, with local citizen groups to work with the police, with armored vehicles and .50 cals all over the nation, all over major newspapers, to mow down protesters with .50 caliber weapons.
[00:34:07.523 --> 00:34:23.094]  And as they bankrupt the pension funds, mainly government pension funds, they will then tell the government bureaucrats, go out and seize more homes, write more tickets, enforce more and more taxes, hundreds of new taxes going in at every level.
[00:34:23.094 --> 00:34:24.415]  You want your pension fund?
[00:34:24.415 --> 00:34:26.336]  It's been lost to the banks.
[00:34:26.336 --> 00:34:29.118]  Go out and squeeze them.
[00:34:29.118 --> 00:34:31.500]  And the bureaucrats will go out and they will squeeze.
[00:34:32.864 --> 00:34:38.948]  They're forging a giant army of darkness and wickedness and unconstitutional corruption.
[00:34:38.948 --> 00:34:41.010]  This is robbery.
[00:34:41.010 --> 00:34:42.671]  This is oppression.
[00:34:42.671 --> 00:34:47.514]  This is tyranny.
[00:34:47.514 --> 00:34:56.141]  Total surveillance grids, your gas, your power, your home to be inspected, remote controlled, your children brainwashed and turned against you.
[00:34:56.892 --> 00:34:59.114]  The borders, completely open.
[00:34:59.114 --> 00:35:02.136]  National worker IDs given to all the illegals.
[00:35:02.136 --> 00:35:03.837]  Then citizens will have to use it.
[00:35:03.837 --> 00:35:11.262]  If you're not in good graces with the IRS, your card will be turned off, your employer will be arrested if they hire you.
[00:35:11.262 --> 00:35:17.327]  One million dollar fines for garage sales, or cutting someone's lawn outside the tax system.
[00:35:17.327 --> 00:35:20.549]  That's the Associated Press Fox News.
[00:35:20.549 --> 00:35:22.631]  Bureaucrats, spies, everywhere.
[00:35:23.424 --> 00:35:24.585]  First they train you.
[00:35:24.585 --> 00:35:26.186]  Oh, spy on drug dealers.
[00:35:26.186 --> 00:35:27.487]  Oh, then spy on Nazis.
[00:35:27.487 --> 00:35:28.728]  Yo, those are all bad groups.
[00:35:28.728 --> 00:35:30.349]  Now, spy on your neighbor.
[00:35:30.349 --> 00:35:32.030]  Did they yell at their wife or husband?
[00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:33.592]  Did they spank their child?
[00:35:33.592 --> 00:35:35.513]  Did they throw a battery away in the trash?
[00:35:35.513 --> 00:35:39.276]  Do they have the wrong light bulbs?
[00:35:39.276 --> 00:35:41.358]  Are they saying bad things about the government?
[00:35:41.358 --> 00:35:45.341]  The White House says, send us emails about people criticizing Obama.
[00:35:45.341 --> 00:35:45.681]  They have
[00:35:47.318 --> 00:35:57.466]  County prosecutors and DAs go on television in multiple states, Missouri and others, and say, if you lie about Obama, we will arrest you.
[00:35:57.466 --> 00:36:00.128]  If you say he's not a Christian, we will arrest you.
[00:36:00.128 --> 00:36:02.429]  If you say he wasn't born here, we will arrest you.
[00:36:02.429 --> 00:36:10.495]  I actually have those video clips in Fall of the Republic, on the news!
[00:36:10.495 --> 00:36:15.019]  They got cops who want to arrest you for your speech, who want to take your guns.
[00:36:16.479 --> 00:36:28.210]  Politicos, who know they go up the chain of power when they have warrantless blood-taking checkpoints, like Art Acevedo, put in by the federal government on record, now set to take over Dallas.
[00:36:28.210 --> 00:36:30.812]  Our Austin police chief.
[00:36:30.812 --> 00:36:37.258]  The feds putting in sheriffs, police chiefs everywhere.
[00:36:37.258 --> 00:36:38.720]  This is a criminal takeover.
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:40.521]  They're watching every angle of it.
[00:36:40.521 --> 00:36:41.963]  They know how we're going to resist.
[00:36:43.154 --> 00:36:46.677]  They know we're gonna wake up and say no to them, and they think they're gonna get away with it.
[00:36:46.677 --> 00:36:47.638]  They think.
[00:36:47.638 --> 00:36:49.800]  And people say, well, what's the limit of the tyranny?
[00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:51.342]  The sky.
[00:36:51.342 --> 00:36:56.487]  As Thomas Jefferson said, you will live under the exact level of tyranny that you put up with.
[00:36:59.212 --> 00:37:04.875]  I want to play a clip here on air because this is going in in all 50 states.
[00:37:04.875 --> 00:37:08.197]  Remember the LA Times headline a few days ago?
[00:37:08.197 --> 00:37:15.482]  28% in your power bill in LA alone as part of new green tax.
[00:37:15.482 --> 00:37:18.223]  If they're telling you 28% can you imagine?
[00:37:18.223 --> 00:37:22.286]  Well in Austin they told us two months ago and they won't say when the vote is now.
[00:37:22.286 --> 00:37:24.607]  They said it would be in February or March.
[00:37:24.607 --> 00:37:26.068]  They claim there's one public hearing.
[00:37:29.394 --> 00:37:30.615]  And they said it's a good thing.
[00:37:30.615 --> 00:37:38.220]  Within three years of the new tax on gas and power, $2.6 billion.
[00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:43.924]  In the town where I live, $2.6 billion.
[00:37:43.924 --> 00:37:51.910]  And of course the statesman reported they have a former Pentagon black ops colonel running all the green programs, the home inspections, all of it.
[00:37:53.547 --> 00:37:54.128]  Oh, the U.N.
[00:37:54.128 --> 00:38:02.574]  brags Austin is at the front line of taking over the U.S., a beta test like Los Angeles or San Francisco.
[00:38:02.574 --> 00:38:06.997]  Of course they've got special ops over the 2.6 bill.
[00:38:06.997 --> 00:38:09.479]  This is a 2.6 billion dollar robbery.
[00:38:09.479 --> 00:38:11.160]  Of course they're in control.
[00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:12.181]  This is black ops.
[00:38:12.181 --> 00:38:13.442]  They don't play games.
[00:38:13.442 --> 00:38:16.404]  They'll go in a country and kill a million people for oil.
[00:38:16.404 --> 00:38:19.927]  They'll go into Afghanistan and kill hundreds of thousands to get some opium.
[00:38:21.834 --> 00:38:25.997]  They'll do anything, and they've got the people that are ready.
[00:38:25.997 --> 00:38:31.080]  And they're coming for your land, your property, everything under Animal ID, Premises ID.
[00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:32.861]  They're gonna take your bank accounts.
[00:38:32.861 --> 00:38:37.563]  They've got slaughter forces, giant brigades of paramilitary police.
[00:38:37.563 --> 00:38:41.406]  They're expanding the SWAT teams into joint training with the main police departments.
[00:38:41.886 --> 00:38:50.028]  The RAND Corporation admits the Feds have already put in an international police system under FEMA and Homeland Security and NORTHCOM.
[00:38:50.028 --> 00:38:52.509]  They're already in control of all the major cities.
[00:38:52.509 --> 00:38:54.469]  They're taking over the small towns now.
[00:38:54.469 --> 00:38:59.451]  This is an absolute black-op criminal takeover.
[00:38:59.451 --> 00:39:01.531]  You put up with them shipping narcotics in.
[00:39:01.531 --> 00:39:02.812]  You put up with them grabbing U.S.
[00:39:02.812 --> 00:39:10.974]  citizens, putting bags over their heads, throwing them in vans, putting them on CIA aircraft and taking them to scores of black sites all over Europe.
[00:39:12.503 --> 00:39:17.827]  The Washington Post came out in 2002 when they thought you were sold on the fear and said, yeah, we torture people's kids.
[00:39:17.827 --> 00:39:21.691]  They have the CIA section chief going, yeah, we do stuff for their kids in front of them.
[00:39:21.691 --> 00:39:30.158]  You had to get fake confessions to turn them, to get people that'll work for them, to get people to go out and carry terror attacks.
[00:39:30.158 --> 00:39:31.439]  They hold their families till they do it.
[00:39:31.439 --> 00:39:37.004]  And they say, after you stage the terror attack, we're going to kill you, but your family will live.
[00:39:37.004 --> 00:39:38.725]  Here's some video of your little girl.
[00:39:38.725 --> 00:39:39.606]  Now watch what we do.
[00:39:41.203 --> 00:39:44.585]  The ultimate darkness is now in control of the country.
[00:39:44.585 --> 00:39:46.707]  The ultimate evil.
[00:39:46.707 --> 00:39:52.491]  And it's in control of almost every other nation.
[00:39:52.491 --> 00:39:54.672]  The ultimate evil.
[00:39:54.672 --> 00:39:59.395]  Not even the Soviets under Stalin admitted that they tortured people.
[00:39:59.395 --> 00:40:02.157]  And that they ordered people to sign confessions.
[00:40:02.157 --> 00:40:04.719]  They just did it.
[00:40:04.719 --> 00:40:07.981]  We have gone further than the Nazis.
[00:40:07.981 --> 00:40:08.342]  And so,
[00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:14.942]  All of you police, all of you military, they're gonna take your pension funds, they're gonna take everything you got when they're done with you.
[00:40:14.942 --> 00:40:16.402]  You're their main enemy.
[00:40:16.402 --> 00:40:23.064]  Many of you laughing right now, a decade from now, you will wish to God you'd have done something.
[00:40:23.064 --> 00:40:27.326]  And then that's our chance to defeat it, down the road.
[00:40:27.326 --> 00:40:31.467]  Because they plan on screwing every one of you that are serving them.
[00:40:31.467 --> 00:40:34.168]  But you're such cowards, you'll probably just go along with it then, you don't care.
[00:40:36.298 --> 00:40:42.161]  It's like 1984, based on true things that Eric Blair, aka George Orwell, witnessed.
[00:40:42.161 --> 00:40:53.227]  He's a member of the British Secret Police, British intelligence worldwide, communist infiltrator, secret police in India, you name it.
[00:40:53.227 --> 00:40:55.068]  BBC top propagandist.
[00:40:55.068 --> 00:41:00.591]  Winston Smith is his character at the Ministry of Truth, from the BBC, lying, spinning, deceiving.
[00:41:02.534 --> 00:41:10.479]  When they arrest his neighbor, who's the biggest servant of the government you can imagine, and his kids are spies and tattling everybody in their apartment building.
[00:41:10.479 --> 00:41:13.781]  They throw him in the cell with Winston, and he says, I'm glad they arrested me.
[00:41:13.781 --> 00:41:15.763]  I don't know what I did, but I'm sure it's bad.
[00:41:15.763 --> 00:41:18.204]  And he loved how they tortured him to death.
[00:41:18.204 --> 00:41:19.145]  He thanked them.
[00:41:19.145 --> 00:41:20.546]  And that's who you are.
[00:41:20.546 --> 00:41:22.007]  Cowardly filth.
[00:41:23.806 --> 00:41:28.508]  I've studied sociology, and it's not just Nazi Germany, but all over the world.
[00:41:28.508 --> 00:41:35.210]  I saw footage a month ago out of Nigeria where they would just grab people off the street, line them up in the middle of the street, and shoot them.
[00:41:35.210 --> 00:41:38.131]  And they would yell at people 50 yards away and say, come here.
[00:41:38.131 --> 00:41:43.293]  People had a chance to run into the buildings and try to at least get away.
[00:41:43.293 --> 00:41:45.694]  Gotta play that footage next week when we're live on TV here.
[00:41:48.055 --> 00:41:50.918]  It was on Al Jazeera, BBC, you name it, if you want to pull it up.
[00:41:50.918 --> 00:41:53.060]  Just Nigerian executions, if you want to see it.
[00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:55.142]  No judge, no jury.
[00:41:55.142 --> 00:41:59.726]  And there's just piles of dead bodies all out in the major city thoroughfare.
[00:41:59.726 --> 00:42:02.929]  It's a four-way stop.
[00:42:02.929 --> 00:42:03.850]  Piles of dead bodies.
[00:42:03.850 --> 00:42:05.511]  And they just wave them over.
[00:42:05.511 --> 00:42:06.913]  They tell them, flip over on your back.
[00:42:09.246 --> 00:42:12.529]  Because killers never want to look you in the eyes.
[00:42:12.529 --> 00:42:13.810]  That's all part of their domination.
[00:42:13.810 --> 00:42:23.157]  You flip over on your stomach, and they walk over with an AK-47, sprayed 10 rounds into their back, and they say, okay, next.
[00:42:23.157 --> 00:42:27.780]  And I always thought I was just run of the mill.
[00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:30.583]  I always didn't think of myself as having courage.
[00:42:30.583 --> 00:42:33.345]  I'll guarantee you, I'm going to fight back.
[00:42:33.345 --> 00:42:36.928]  I'm going to make a run for it.
[00:42:36.928 --> 00:42:38.449]  I'm not going to get marched into that pit.
[00:42:39.554 --> 00:42:41.715]  And that's the big ace in the hole.
[00:42:41.715 --> 00:42:53.899]  The globalists know there's hundreds of millions of gun owners, over 150 million, 400 million guns, and they know if 1% of you stand up, you can defeat them all.
[00:42:53.899 --> 00:42:54.759]  And that's the difference.
[00:42:54.759 --> 00:43:00.721]  But they're counting on you just laying your guns down, being marched into a pit, and shot in the back of the head.
[00:43:00.721 --> 00:43:02.462]  It always happens everywhere else.
[00:43:02.462 --> 00:43:07.284]  Now, we're trying to fix things peacefully, and they're trying to short-circuit us right now and get a violent revolution going.
[00:43:07.284 --> 00:43:08.164]  That's not what we want.
[00:43:10.097 --> 00:43:15.438]  But there will come a time for all of you when you just gotta gut up and defend yourself.
[00:43:15.438 --> 00:43:19.019]  Don't go into the pits, just don't go along with it, okay?
[00:43:19.019 --> 00:43:30.541]  That's my right as a free human being to say I'm not going down without standing up.
[00:43:30.541 --> 00:43:32.942]  They're gonna take everything we've got, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:43:33.843 --> 00:43:40.329]  And Limbaugh's saying it's high treason, it's the overthrow of the Constitution, it's illegal, these people should be arrested.
[00:43:40.329 --> 00:43:40.709]  Wow!
[00:43:40.709 --> 00:43:45.253]  Limbaugh is genuinely upset.
[00:43:45.253 --> 00:43:51.558]  I think he needs, boy, they're going to really come after him now.
[00:43:51.558 --> 00:43:52.579]  Never heard him talk like this.
[00:43:52.579 --> 00:43:53.240]  He's telling the truth.
[00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:56.162]  But hey, Limbaugh, where were you on the Patriot Act for U.S.
[00:43:56.162 --> 00:43:56.483]  citizens?
[00:43:56.483 --> 00:43:58.164]  Where were you on NORTHCOM?
[00:43:58.164 --> 00:43:59.846]  Where were you when Bush did the bailout?
[00:43:59.846 --> 00:44:00.706]  Well, you were against it.
[00:44:00.706 --> 00:44:01.307]  Beck was for it.
[00:44:03.312 --> 00:44:05.273]  I mean, where were all you mainline conservatives?
[00:44:05.273 --> 00:44:15.978]  You see, if you let the Republicans butcher the Bill of Rights, it's only going to get worse in the next administration, and when Republicans come in, you watch, it'll only get worse again, until we vote out all the incumbents.
[00:44:15.978 --> 00:44:30.005]  And there's a key Politico article about how Rand Paul, in Kentucky, running for the Senate, it's very hard for dark horses to get in there, he is in some polls ten points ahead, most polls about six points.
[00:44:30.005 --> 00:44:30.946]  Some polls as low as three.
[00:44:32.113 --> 00:44:38.898]  But an index of polls at 6% on average, scientific, against the big neocon funded Republican.
[00:44:38.898 --> 00:44:40.940]  And he's way above the Democratic challenger.
[00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:41.801]  He's going to win.
[00:44:41.801 --> 00:44:47.465]  And that's why Dick Cheney and others are putting out letters against him right now.
[00:44:47.465 --> 00:44:53.390]  So see, it isn't just the Kennedy seat getting voted out with Brown.
[00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:59.655]  Perry wouldn't have won, but he posed as a patriot above Medina.
[00:44:59.655 --> 00:45:00.536]  And it looks like
[00:45:02.301 --> 00:45:14.097]  Rand Paul is so clean that he's gonna probably end up being the next senator from Kentucky and they are scared to death because it's incumbents that are in trouble.
[00:45:14.097 --> 00:45:17.221]  You kick out all these Lindsey Graham types, all this scum,
[00:45:18.578 --> 00:45:20.539]  You kick out people.
[00:45:20.539 --> 00:45:21.920]  I mean, that's why Kucinich was good.
[00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:22.960]  He never flip-flopped.
[00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:24.881]  He was anti-war, anti-patriot act.
[00:45:24.881 --> 00:45:27.142]  He admitted the health care bill was a rip-off.
[00:45:27.142 --> 00:45:29.023]  And he is pure trash now.
[00:45:29.023 --> 00:45:31.764]  Because he fully knew.
[00:45:31.764 --> 00:45:33.405]  He is very intelligent.
[00:45:33.405 --> 00:45:41.128]  He correctly identified it as a giant banking rip-off that takes control of our lives and gives liability protection to the insurance companies.
[00:45:41.128 --> 00:45:42.229]  You're gonna get less health care now.
[00:45:44.571 --> 00:45:45.951]  It's a new tax.
[00:45:45.951 --> 00:45:50.213]  He knew fully and flip-flopped Tuesday.
[00:45:50.213 --> 00:45:54.434]  Now, Ventura said global warming was real, then got educated and said it was a fraud.
[00:45:54.434 --> 00:45:55.674]  He's come a long way.
[00:45:55.674 --> 00:45:59.635]  So yeah, Ventura's kind of been like, well, where was the Tea Party 10 years ago?
[00:45:59.635 --> 00:46:03.436]  Criticizing Republicans for being for a police state, but now being against it.
[00:46:03.436 --> 00:46:05.517]  Ventura is in a process of waking up.
[00:46:07.145 --> 00:46:12.127]  So yeah, Ventura's kind of like, yeah, we need to give people health care, but we need to get rid of both parties.
[00:46:12.127 --> 00:46:13.227]  He just doesn't know the facts.
[00:46:13.227 --> 00:46:15.588]  I guarantee if I had time with him, he'd be against it.
[00:46:15.588 --> 00:46:17.308]  That's the difference.
[00:46:17.308 --> 00:46:24.031]  Dennis Kucinich knows full well what is going on.
[00:46:24.031 --> 00:46:25.891]  But you can't just tell Ventura something over the phone.
[00:46:25.891 --> 00:46:30.693]  You've got to be with him in a meeting at a hotel and bring all the articles and show him the bill and show him and then he'll
[00:46:35.111 --> 00:46:36.072]  But at least he's real.
[00:46:36.072 --> 00:46:37.253]  I mean, I know him.
[00:46:37.253 --> 00:46:39.875]  I know he's real.
[00:46:39.875 --> 00:47:02.015]  Dennis Kucinich was real, but was taken up on the mountain by Satan and offered the whole world, up there 35,000 feet in the air, that's up on a mountain, notice the symbolism of that, with Barack Obama, and when he walked off that plane with that satisfied, I'm slitting America's throat, I'm gonna get control of their lives, I'm gonna get to seize all their bank accounts, I'm gonna expand the IRS in every facet of their life,
[00:47:03.643 --> 00:47:06.645]  They're taking over the internet right now, that's all being announced.
[00:47:06.645 --> 00:47:16.250]  When he walked off with that satisfied look, I knew Monday, I said, you watch, Kucinich rolled.
[00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:17.890]  And he did, he rolled over.
[00:47:17.890 --> 00:47:21.012]  He makes me sick!
[00:47:21.012 --> 00:47:25.835]  Nothing makes me more sick than somebody that knows exactly what they're doing and doing it.
[00:47:25.835 --> 00:47:26.735]  That's evil.
[00:47:26.735 --> 00:47:29.236]  It's the consciousness of the evil.
[00:47:29.236 --> 00:47:29.476]  It's the
[00:47:33.547 --> 00:47:37.370]  Oh, it makes me sick.
[00:47:37.370 --> 00:47:49.621]  And so you kick Dennis Kucinich out, you make sure, oh, he's gonna get all the corporate money, he's gonna get all Obama's support, everything, you make sure that little rat isn't in office coming up in a year.
[00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:58.975]  And you make, get up off your butts everybody, and I'm talking to new listeners, and find out who your representatives are at the state and federal level.
[00:47:58.975 --> 00:48:00.937]  Find out who your city council is.
[00:48:00.937 --> 00:48:04.820]  Find out what's going on, because listen, a prison is being set up around you.
[00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:09.403]  Let's go to this clip with the remote control thermostats.
[00:48:09.403 --> 00:48:11.485]  Oh, but they whitewash it.
[00:48:11.485 --> 00:48:14.227]  Some people think it's not good.
[00:48:14.227 --> 00:48:14.607]  Here it is.
[00:48:17.059 --> 00:48:17.539]  Good evening.
[00:48:17.539 --> 00:48:27.025]  A new energy conservation program that allows Rocky Mountain Power to turn off your air conditioning compressor only needs the governor's signature to become law.
[00:48:27.025 --> 00:48:29.906]  But some feel it's too much government in your home.
[00:48:29.906 --> 00:48:31.888]  Sarah Dollop joins us with details.
[00:48:31.888 --> 00:48:32.148]  Sarah?
[00:48:33.075 --> 00:48:39.882]  Well, Keith and Carol, Cool Keepers is already up and running in about 90,000 homes across the Wasatch Front.
[00:48:39.882 --> 00:48:47.691]  The difference with the new program is that instead of opting in, choosing that you want to participate in the program, you have to opt out.
[00:48:50.117 --> 00:48:54.662]  On sweltering summer days in Utah, your comfort isn't the only thing being tested.
[00:48:54.662 --> 00:48:56.864]  The power grid is too.
[00:48:56.864 --> 00:49:00.889]  So Rocky Mountain Power introduced the CoolKeeper system seven years ago.
[00:49:00.889 --> 00:49:05.594]  It's one of those cases where if everybody does a little, they can make a big difference.
[00:49:05.894 --> 00:49:06.875]  It's fairly simple.
[00:49:06.875 --> 00:49:12.638]  When demand gets too high, your compressor can be turned off for 15 minutes every half hour.
[00:49:12.638 --> 00:49:17.301]  Rocky Mountain Power says it results in no more than a couple degree temperature difference.
[00:49:17.301 --> 00:49:19.782]  97% of the people who are on it like it.
[00:49:19.782 --> 00:49:28.067]  So the company says it makes sense to enroll everyone along the Wasatch Front with the provision that people can opt out completely or on certain days.
[00:49:28.627 --> 00:49:36.539]  That's one of the reasons the Utah Office of Consumer Services chose to get behind Senate Bill 47, which awaits the governor's signature.
[00:49:36.539 --> 00:49:44.411]  If Rocky Mountain Power fully complies with the law, then every impacted consumer should have plenty of information about this before any change is made.
[00:49:44.773 --> 00:49:46.935]  I spoke out very, very much against it.
[00:49:46.935 --> 00:49:53.339]  Senator Chris Butters was one of several lawmakers to vote no for the bill, which initially failed in the Senate.
[00:49:53.339 --> 00:50:01.705]  He worries the wording in the bill is too vague as far as the amount of time your compressor could be turned off, and he believes it's too far-reaching.
[00:50:01.705 --> 00:50:07.169]  I think it's right on the edge of being absolutely terrible.
[00:50:07.169 --> 00:50:09.231]  It's a government intrusion that shouldn't happen.
[00:50:10.487 --> 00:50:14.429]  And Rocky Mountain Power still has to put a detailed plan in writing.
[00:50:14.429 --> 00:50:16.830]  Alright, that's enough of it.
[00:50:16.830 --> 00:50:19.552]  The rest is up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:50:19.552 --> 00:50:21.173]  On the edge?
[00:50:21.173 --> 00:50:27.776]  This isn't on the edge of the precipice, this is the bottom of the canyon 10,000 feet below.
[00:50:27.776 --> 00:50:29.817]  On the edge?
[00:50:29.817 --> 00:50:33.319]  Oh, torturing children in front of their parents on the edge?
[00:50:33.319 --> 00:50:34.700]  The government remote controlling?
[00:50:35.876 --> 00:50:44.880]  And by the way, all the new big refrigerators, the cars, all the big think tanks, MIT say, your refrigerator's gonna be monitored.
[00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:54.525]  In fact, I saw an article two years ago about old folks' homes that people opt into, and everything is tracked, what food they're eating, what they do, they send to elder care.
[00:50:54.525 --> 00:50:56.185]  It's your prison.
[00:50:56.185 --> 00:50:57.986]  The government running everything.
[00:50:57.986 --> 00:50:59.427]  And we're just a bunch of idiot children.
[00:51:01.121 --> 00:51:06.482]  For safety, you lock doors, set alarms, buy antivirus software, maybe even have a watchdog.
[00:51:06.482 --> 00:51:08.883]  Do you care as much about your air and water?

[00:51:30.629 --> 00:51:39.953]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it lent back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:51:39.953 --> 00:51:47.016]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:51:47.016 --> 00:51:50.938]  Hi, Ted Anderson, I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[00:51:51.138 --> 00:51:52.079]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[00:51:52.079 --> 00:51:55.782]  It's time to understand the system.
[00:51:55.782 --> 00:51:58.104]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:51:58.104 --> 00:52:02.568]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:52:02.568 --> 00:52:06.592]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:52:06.592 --> 00:52:09.835]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:52:09.835 --> 00:52:11.256]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:52:11.952 --> 00:52:14.614]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:52:14.614 --> 00:52:21.018]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:21.018 --> 00:52:26.201]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:52:26.201 --> 00:52:29.483]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[00:52:29.483 --> 00:52:36.328]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:52:36.328 --> 00:52:38.669]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:52:38.669 --> 00:52:40.250]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:40.250 --> 00:52:41.131]  And the Congress is saying,
[00:52:41.491 --> 00:52:42.691]  Who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:42.691 --> 00:52:44.832]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:52:44.832 --> 00:52:49.974]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:52:49.974 --> 00:52:54.976]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[00:53:02.532 --> 00:53:04.173]  Is it safe to breathe anymore?
[00:53:04.173 --> 00:53:15.620]  Crowded public places, global pandemics, and news reports of potential new strains of bacteria and viruses make you wonder, what if there was a germ-killing nasal spray that acted almost like hand sanitizer for your nose?
[00:53:15.620 --> 00:53:16.581]  There is!
[00:53:16.581 --> 00:53:20.323]  It's called Sinofresh Homeopathic Nasal Spray, and it's a proven germ killer.
[00:53:20.663 --> 00:53:29.252]  Sinofresh is a revolutionary doctor-recommended nasal spray that kills a broad spectrum of viruses, bacteria, molds, and fungi on contact in your nose.
[00:53:29.252 --> 00:53:37.420]  Sinofresh causes no drug interactions, no loss of smell, no rebound congestion, contains no alcohol, is non-habit forming, and is safe for daily use.
[00:53:37.420 --> 00:53:39.883]  Sinofresh must be a part of your family's survival plan.

[00:53:56.493 --> 00:53:57.554]  Breathe safe.
[00:53:57.554 --> 00:53:58.695]  Use Sinofresh.
[00:53:58.695 --> 00:54:01.116]  It works.
[00:54:01.116 --> 00:54:03.918]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:54:03.918 --> 00:54:06.720]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:26.389]  I'm going to get back into the criminal health care takeover and a lot of other key police state issues like the government remote controlling refrigerator, your computers, by law, by law you will have this, your thermostat, your air conditioners, your heating system.
[00:54:28.123 --> 00:54:33.185]  It's like people 30 years ago could do great arithmetic, now hardly anyone can because of calculators.
[00:54:33.185 --> 00:54:36.066]  It'll just be, oh yeah, I don't run my house, the government decides.
[00:54:36.066 --> 00:54:40.909]  And they've all said in government think tanks that they're going to do this.
[00:54:40.909 --> 00:54:52.854]  And I would tell people about this and they'd laugh, just like they want to put taxes on salt, sugar, make you swipe a card for everything you buy and sell to decide what type of insurance you get because everything's going to be socialized through health care.
[00:54:54.215 --> 00:54:58.404]  And so, oh, you're unhealthy, you're going to pay more because we're all in this together.
[00:54:58.404 --> 00:54:59.627]  See, no one can be independent.
[00:55:01.749 --> 00:55:05.111]  This is the big Trojan horse of collectivism.
[00:55:05.111 --> 00:55:07.092]  Well, we got this email from Ventura's office.
[00:55:07.092 --> 00:55:22.280]  It says, Dear Tim, that's to my video and book shipping department head, I wanted you and Alex to know that we have just heard from the New York Times that American Conspiracies will debut number six on their hardcover nonfiction bestseller list on Sunday.
[00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:23.201]  That's a big deal.
[00:55:23.201 --> 00:55:25.142]  That's an overall integrated list nationwide.
[00:55:26.507 --> 00:55:27.328]  March 28th.
[00:55:27.328 --> 00:55:29.509]  This is thrilling for everyone here at Skyhorse.
[00:55:29.509 --> 00:55:32.151]  I hope you and Alex and everyone there are pleased as well.
[00:55:32.151 --> 00:55:35.393]  Thank you for working with us and to promote the book.
[00:55:35.393 --> 00:55:36.414]  Absolutely.
[00:55:36.414 --> 00:55:37.535]  We just put in another order.
[00:55:37.535 --> 00:55:41.437]  We haven't sold out yet, so anybody that orders will get it.
[00:55:41.437 --> 00:55:42.398]  $19.95 hardcover.
[00:55:42.398 --> 00:55:47.461]  That's $5 off, and you get a free documentary film of your choice at InfoWars.com.
[00:55:47.461 --> 00:55:50.783]  No one, no one has a deal even close to that.
[00:55:50.783 --> 00:55:50.964]  That's a
[00:55:52.452 --> 00:56:02.259]  for 95 value for $19.95 at InfoWars.com and you can also pre-order and it ships out the order they're received.
[00:56:02.259 --> 00:56:04.200]  This book of course has now been shipping for weeks.

[00:56:07.216 --> 00:56:11.318]  A new will order to find our new film, Jason Berman's 18 Months of the Making.
[00:56:11.318 --> 00:56:18.742]  The new official trailer is up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com along with a sneak peek.
[00:56:18.742 --> 00:56:20.203]  Another trailer coming out next week.
[00:56:20.203 --> 00:56:24.625]  Over the weekend we're going to launch the Police State 4 Rise of FEMA trailer.
[00:56:24.625 --> 00:56:28.487]  You can start pre-ordering that as well if you'd like at InfoWars.com.
[00:56:28.487 --> 00:56:34.910]  So the good news is Ventura Show, top ratings, his book, bestseller, a week and a half in, top ten.
[00:56:36.656 --> 00:56:38.117]  My show's exploding.
[00:56:38.117 --> 00:56:39.078]  The people are hungry.
[00:56:39.078 --> 00:56:40.018]  They're starting to wake up.
[00:56:40.018 --> 00:56:42.300]  But, folks, you've got to not just listen.
[00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:44.221]  You've got to go to city council, to state house.
[00:56:44.221 --> 00:56:45.421]  You've got to run for office.
[00:56:45.421 --> 00:56:47.062]  You've got to warn people.
[00:56:47.062 --> 00:56:52.466]  You've got to really gut up and physically have it hit you in your gut.
[00:56:52.466 --> 00:56:53.587]  This happens to me all the time.
[00:56:53.587 --> 00:56:56.328]  I get conditioned to just kind of accept this tyranny.
[00:56:56.328 --> 00:56:59.570]  Intellectually, I'm against it, but I just kind of get comfortable with it.
[00:56:59.570 --> 00:57:01.371]  Like, oh, it's like having cancer or something.
[00:57:01.371 --> 00:57:02.252]  Oh, I just got cancer.
[00:57:02.252 --> 00:57:03.673]  Yeah, I'm going to die.
[00:57:03.673 --> 00:57:05.234]  But we've got a chance to beat this.
[00:57:06.857 --> 00:57:08.759]  And say, no!
[00:57:08.759 --> 00:57:11.181]  We've got to fight this for the future of humanity.
[00:57:11.181 --> 00:57:16.346]  We just can't roll over and have this narcissistic, cynical attitude.
[00:57:16.346 --> 00:57:21.250]  Some are narcissists, others have such low self-esteem.
[00:57:21.250 --> 00:57:22.371]  I don't care if you're blind.
[00:57:22.371 --> 00:57:23.833]  I don't care if you've got a speech impediment.
[00:57:23.833 --> 00:57:27.156]  You've got the power of the living God in your soul.
[00:57:27.156 --> 00:57:30.639]  You are an incredible, sentient being with a mission.
[00:57:31.772 --> 00:57:48.406]  And the mission is liberty and freedom for this species and to go to the stars and not let a technocratic, psychopathic, tiny control group dominate our society and turn America and the world into a playground for its sadists.
[00:57:48.406 --> 00:57:49.887]  Can't you see it all around you?
[00:57:49.887 --> 00:57:51.849]  This is devilish!
[00:57:51.849 --> 00:57:57.974]  Even if you don't believe in Satan, you at least can see the manifestation of pure evil through our species.
[00:58:01.124 --> 00:58:03.425]  My God, we're in so much trouble.
[00:58:03.425 --> 00:58:08.548]  My God, we're in trouble.
[00:58:08.548 --> 00:58:11.090]  You know, I missed this article for over a week.
[00:58:11.090 --> 00:58:13.471]  I saw it two days ago from Bloomberg.
[00:58:13.471 --> 00:58:17.053]  It's also in Businessweek.
[00:58:17.053 --> 00:58:19.754]  Failed banks may get pension fund backing.
[00:58:19.754 --> 00:58:21.175]  FDIC seeks cash.
[00:58:21.175 --> 00:58:22.496]  Yeah, taking your pension funds.
[00:58:24.104 --> 00:58:25.124]  Just the magnitude.
[00:58:25.124 --> 00:58:26.265]  I mean, I knew this would happen.
[00:58:26.265 --> 00:58:32.547]  I saw him change the law five, six years ago, but to actually see them now moving greedily.
[00:58:32.547 --> 00:58:38.049]  And you complain, you go out and protest, they say they're just going to pull up with 50 cows and cut you in half.
[00:58:38.049 --> 00:58:39.710]  God almighty, these people are evil.
[00:58:39.710 --> 00:58:46.052]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:56.062]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[00:58:56.062 --> 00:58:58.803]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[00:58:58.803 --> 00:59:04.125]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[00:59:04.125 --> 00:59:08.606]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from Infowars.com.

[00:59:38.578 --> 00:59:39.979]  Shadow government.

[00:59:53.770 --> 00:59:56.152]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.152 --> 00:59:58.954]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.512 --> 01:00:10.336]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.336 --> 01:00:11.937]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.937 --> 01:00:13.498]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.498 --> 01:00:17.682]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.682 --> 01:00:26.829]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:26.829 --> 01:00:28.650]  Alright, here's the deal.
[01:00:28.650 --> 01:00:33.014]  In this shower, I'm gonna open the phones up, but only on the healthcare takeover.
[01:00:34.967 --> 01:00:44.350]  Or your homes becoming remote-controlled prison boxes with the government running your refrigerator power, monitoring you.
[01:00:44.350 --> 01:00:46.811]  Houston Police Chief calls for cameras in all homes.
[01:00:46.811 --> 01:00:50.473]  England's already doing it to 20,000 newborn baby families.
[01:00:50.473 --> 01:00:52.373]  This is a scientific prison.
[01:00:52.373 --> 01:00:54.774]  Laptops, watching your kids.
[01:00:54.774 --> 01:00:56.975]  I want to get your take on that.
[01:00:56.975 --> 01:00:59.836]  I'm going to get into cyber security at the bottom of the hour.
[01:01:01.288 --> 01:01:02.769]  They have not changed the bill.
[01:01:02.769 --> 01:01:06.171]  That's a lie, and the news even admits this.
[01:01:06.171 --> 01:01:08.893]  They've changed a little bit of the wording, but in essence it's the same thing.
[01:01:08.893 --> 01:01:15.918]  I haven't even gone over in detail yet the health care bill, but I'm going to give you the toll-free number to join us right now.
[01:01:15.918 --> 01:01:16.539]  It's 1-800-259-9231.
[01:01:16.539 --> 01:01:22.263]  But I'm going to quote Thomas Jefferson again.
[01:01:22.263 --> 01:01:30.849]  I swear on the altar of Almighty God, eternal vigilance and resistance to every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[01:01:32.648 --> 01:01:36.069]  I pledge.
[01:01:36.069 --> 01:01:40.431]  I commit myself.
[01:01:40.431 --> 01:01:48.413]  You know, I'm worldly, we all are, but I've lost a lot of my worldliness as I just get more and more real.
[01:01:48.413 --> 01:01:51.794]  And I see more and more of my evil, more and more of my corruption.
[01:01:51.794 --> 01:01:57.856]  I would be seen by the average person as an extremely moral, pious person, focused, dedicated, but I'm not.
[01:02:03.462 --> 01:02:12.245]  And that's what scares me is that when I am in the presence of my creator, the creator, I feel ashamed.
[01:02:12.245 --> 01:02:15.226]  That's why I don't like callers telling me how great I am.
[01:02:15.226 --> 01:02:17.707]  I'm not great, okay?
[01:02:17.707 --> 01:02:19.047]  I'm doing what I have to do.
[01:02:19.047 --> 01:02:20.148]  I'm doing what's demanded.
[01:02:20.148 --> 01:02:22.508]  I'm doing... I can't control myself.
[01:02:22.508 --> 01:02:23.889]  All I can do is stand against this.
[01:02:25.796 --> 01:02:29.777]  And as Americans, as people worldwide, we think we're wholesome, we think we're good.
[01:02:29.777 --> 01:02:36.599]  Now we need to repent every day and admit that our greatest works are like dirty rags.
[01:02:36.599 --> 01:02:38.419]  They are.
[01:02:38.419 --> 01:02:41.400]  I feel like a dirty rag.
[01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:54.903]  But only in realizing I'm a dirty rag in the middle of this wonderful creation, that I've been decadent, that I haven't appreciated it, that I'm worldly, I try to be strong, I try to be upright, I try to be pure, I try to be serious, I try to be focused,
[01:02:58.643 --> 01:03:03.647]  But on the final equation, there's no time for me to joke around, screw around, nothing.
[01:03:03.647 --> 01:03:17.076]  In my private life, in everything, I've got to go to the next level.
[01:03:17.076 --> 01:03:20.799]  And God's been working with me to go to the next level.
[01:03:20.799 --> 01:03:27.223]  Let me tell you, I've seen the devil intensify the darts he's throwing at me a thousand percent.
[01:03:27.223 --> 01:03:27.824]  But that only
[01:03:31.015 --> 01:03:37.277]  Purifies me even more.
[01:03:37.277 --> 01:03:48.821]  And I, the only fear I've got is that before I go, I want to get that much closer up the mountain.
[01:03:48.821 --> 01:03:54.623]  And I want to be strong, and I know the position I'm in, and it's embarrassing.
[01:03:54.623 --> 01:03:58.685]  It's embarrassing that I am the number one fighter of the New World Order.
[01:03:59.431 --> 01:04:06.115]  There's no doubt, any way you slice it, of getting out hardcore info and waking people up.
[01:04:06.115 --> 01:04:11.758]  It's embarrassing because I know the mistakes I make.
[01:04:11.758 --> 01:04:27.548]  I'm aware of the responsibility I've got, and I know in my heart and soul what I should be doing, and I try to carry it out.
[01:04:31.274 --> 01:04:33.416]  What makes me even sicker is I'm the best.
[01:04:33.416 --> 01:04:37.238]  I'm the best we've got.
[01:04:37.238 --> 01:04:40.121]  I'm the best there is, hands down.
[01:04:40.121 --> 01:04:42.422]  And I'm nothing.
[01:04:42.422 --> 01:04:45.885]  And I see how good the evil ones are at evil.
[01:04:45.885 --> 01:04:49.487]  Their endless energy, their enjoyment, their... Don't have to follow any of the rules.
[01:04:49.487 --> 01:04:51.509]  And I just... I just want to see them fall.
[01:04:51.509 --> 01:04:53.971]  I want to see them stop hurting innocent people.
[01:04:53.971 --> 01:04:55.192]  I want the pain to stop.
[01:04:55.192 --> 01:04:56.833]  I want the evil out of our lives.
[01:04:56.833 --> 01:04:59.375]  But that has to change in our hearts first.
[01:05:00.697 --> 01:05:01.998]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:05:01.998 --> 01:05:07.583]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:05:07.583 --> 01:05:12.607]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:05:12.607 --> 01:05:17.632]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:05:18.172 --> 01:05:23.396]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:05:23.396 --> 01:05:25.718]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[01:05:25.718 --> 01:05:30.502]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:05:30.502 --> 01:05:31.623]  And here's the best part.
[01:05:31.623 --> 01:05:34.685]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:05:34.685 --> 01:05:37.988]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.

[01:05:44.851 --> 01:05:48.292]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:05:48.292 --> 01:05:50.033]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:06:00.683 --> 01:06:01.845]  What's your home worth?

[01:07:55.422 --> 01:07:58.984]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:24.055 --> 01:08:29.677]  I haven't even gotten into the cyber security build, the latest version.
[01:08:29.677 --> 01:08:46.364]  I want to get more into the health care takeover, the government remote controlling everything in your homes, literally being announced everywhere, starting with your electricity, your thermostat, your air conditioners, your refrigerators.
[01:08:49.599 --> 01:08:51.080]  A lot of key banking news.
[01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:58.986]  The Federal Reserve now wants to have unlimited power to not even have fractional reserve banking, but just produce any amount of money they want for themselves.
[01:08:58.986 --> 01:09:02.408]  Failed banks may get pension fund backing as FDIC seeks cash.
[01:09:02.408 --> 01:09:03.869]  Bloomberg.
[01:09:03.869 --> 01:09:06.311]  It's all coming up, but right now let's go to your phone calls.
[01:09:06.311 --> 01:09:12.776]  Tim in Missouri, you're on the air.
[01:09:12.776 --> 01:09:13.617]  Yeah.
[01:09:13.617 --> 01:09:15.058]  Go ahead, you're on the air, Tim.
[01:09:15.058 --> 01:09:16.859]  Oh, Mr. Jones, it's a pleasure to speak with you.
[01:09:17.749 --> 01:09:21.172]  My question is about your friend Jesse Ventura's television show.
[01:09:21.172 --> 01:09:28.359]  The interview you had in the remote airplane hangar with the doctor.
[01:09:28.359 --> 01:09:29.941]  Yes.
[01:09:29.941 --> 01:09:31.102]  Was that a reenactment or no?
[01:09:32.927 --> 01:09:37.328]  Well, I wasn't there on that shoot, but no, she was just coming through one area of the U.S.
[01:09:37.328 --> 01:09:40.669]  and agreed to meet him there.
[01:09:40.669 --> 01:09:43.350]  But no, none of it was a reenactment.
[01:09:43.350 --> 01:09:53.813]  As much as there is a reenactment, they'll say, well, we want to interview you at different spots, so there's different shots each time they talk to you.
[01:09:53.813 --> 01:09:56.274]  But it's a real discussion that goes on.
[01:09:56.274 --> 01:09:57.615]  Tim, I appreciate your call.
[01:09:59.264 --> 01:10:07.072]  Was pretty clear that I wanted to get into government health care and let callers call in with their take on the fact that it looks like it may pass.
[01:10:07.072 --> 01:10:15.981]  They'll need one more vote to then deem that the Senate version has passed the House without a full vote.
[01:10:15.981 --> 01:10:19.665]  But I guess, I guess that's not going to happen, huh?
[01:10:19.665 --> 01:10:21.207]  Noel in Illinois, you're on the air.
[01:10:22.501 --> 01:10:29.327]  Alex Jones, sir, it's pretty sad to watch Barry Satoro lie to the American people.
[01:10:29.327 --> 01:10:40.677]  Today I was just watching him at George Mason University, just continuously lying and sucking up the public to believe in this false prophet known as Mr. Satoro, but it doesn't seem like anyone cares.
[01:10:40.677 --> 01:10:41.938]  They're only worried about Barry Satoro.
[01:10:41.938 --> 01:10:42.219]  That's right.
[01:10:42.219 --> 01:10:43.600]  Everything about him is a lie.
[01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:45.582]  His real name is Barry Satoro.
[01:10:45.582 --> 01:10:46.983]  On record, that's his real name.
[01:10:49.625 --> 01:10:52.250]  He lied about signing statements.
[01:10:52.250 --> 01:10:53.772]  He lied about not hiring lobbyists.
[01:10:53.772 --> 01:10:55.134]  He lied about the banker bailout.
[01:10:55.134 --> 01:10:56.657]  He lies about everything.
[01:10:57.640 --> 01:11:00.123]  Except that he'd take your paycheck if you didn't have insurance.
[01:11:00.123 --> 01:11:01.004]  They're going ahead with that.
[01:11:01.004 --> 01:11:03.906]  Then they lied and said it doesn't cover illegal aliens.
[01:11:03.906 --> 01:11:04.507]  That's in there.
[01:11:04.507 --> 01:11:06.369]  They lied and said, okay, we won't take your check.
[01:11:06.369 --> 01:11:08.211]  It's in the final bill.
[01:11:08.211 --> 01:11:09.712]  Just everything is a lie.
[01:11:09.712 --> 01:11:14.517]  This guy is 100% lies.
[01:11:14.517 --> 01:11:18.281]  And the people go, well, he's lied a bunch, but I still like him.
[01:11:18.281 --> 01:11:19.002]  Okay.
[01:11:19.002 --> 01:11:19.242]  Okay.
[01:11:22.472 --> 01:11:24.973]  ...in Kansas to win March Madness.
[01:11:24.973 --> 01:11:44.202]  It's despicable to see this piece of this scum on TV just lie, but my question to you is, I don't know if you saw this report on the Drudge Report, but already down in, I think it was Seattle, the Walgreens is denying new Medicaid patients down in the Pacific Northwest.
[01:11:44.202 --> 01:11:51.065]  Also, my question is about, I saw Idaho, first state to try to sue the federal government,
[01:11:51.505 --> 01:12:04.811]  Do you think they should also, for these states trying to sue the tyrannical Socialist America state, that we should put, it's unconstitutional because Barry Sotoro is unconstitutionally fit to be president?
[01:12:04.811 --> 01:12:10.313]  I think we all should call him President Sotoro from now on and not Barack Hussein Obama.
[01:12:10.313 --> 01:12:11.734]  I'm going to keep praying for you, Alex.
[01:12:11.734 --> 01:12:13.254]  You are the real deal.
[01:12:13.254 --> 01:12:18.877]  Thank you for waking me up in March with the Obama deception and for unplugging me from the matrix.
[01:12:18.877 --> 01:12:19.677]  Thank you so much, sir.
[01:12:20.216 --> 01:12:20.838]  God bless you.
[01:12:20.838 --> 01:12:22.682]  I appreciate your call.
[01:12:22.682 --> 01:12:24.366]  George and Connecticut, you're on the air.
[01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:26.740]  Thanks a lot.
[01:12:26.740 --> 01:12:30.981]  Why can't we just make this a defeat?
[01:12:30.981 --> 01:12:32.802]  If it is a defeat, I hope to God it isn't.
[01:12:32.802 --> 01:12:37.283]  But let's face it, at this point we can only think that that's the way it's going to go.
[01:12:37.283 --> 01:12:39.643]  We are never defeated until we give up.
[01:12:39.643 --> 01:12:40.563]  Absolutely.
[01:12:40.563 --> 01:12:42.344]  This is going to blow up in their face.
[01:12:42.344 --> 01:12:45.724]  We're going to use this at the state level to get true patriots elected.
[01:12:45.724 --> 01:12:47.785]  And it's going to be overturned and repealed.
[01:12:47.785 --> 01:12:53.346]  And when the Republican leadership in the next few years doesn't fully repeal it, we must remove every one of those stinking criminals.
[01:12:54.451 --> 01:13:10.821]  No, what I'm getting at is maybe this is the greatest method we could use to finally defeat the entire federal tax bill, because make people realize that not only are they trying to take away every right you have through this bill, but that the whole thing is illegal just to tax you in the beginning.
[01:13:10.821 --> 01:13:19.126]  So when people realize how destructive this whole thing is, they're going to be going after the weakest people who supposedly they're helping with this tax bill.
[01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:29.148]  They're going to take away their home, the money they have, the little bit of money they have in their bank account, the IRAs, or everything they can take away, they're going to take away.
[01:13:29.148 --> 01:13:32.471]  And the people that supposedly are helping with this bill is not.
[01:13:32.471 --> 01:13:48.404]  But if we can use the IRS, the whole IRS structure is illegal, make people realize that, that the whole thing caves in on them, they piss people off so badly, that maybe they'll finally wake up and maybe we can take down the whole tax system, the way they're doing this.
[01:13:48.971 --> 01:13:50.011]  Excellent point, George.
[01:13:50.011 --> 01:13:51.011]  Let me elaborate on that.
[01:13:51.011 --> 01:13:53.352]  Appreciate the call.
[01:13:53.352 --> 01:13:54.892]  We didn't have an income tax.
[01:13:54.892 --> 01:13:58.033]  It's in the Communist Manifesto.
[01:13:58.033 --> 01:14:00.533]  Until 1913, when the private Federal Reserve took over.
[01:14:00.533 --> 01:14:01.933]  Same year they got it rammed through.
[01:14:01.933 --> 01:14:03.714]  And by the way, it was not properly ratified.
[01:14:03.714 --> 01:14:05.754]  That's been proven by the state attorney generals.
[01:14:05.754 --> 01:14:09.115]  A bunch of the states, they said that ratified it.
[01:14:09.115 --> 01:14:09.395]  Didn't.
[01:14:09.395 --> 01:14:10.495]  That's been proven.
[01:14:10.495 --> 01:14:14.496]  Then the tax wasn't applied to the general public till the early 50s.
[01:14:14.496 --> 01:14:15.356]  It had been less than 1% before that.
[01:14:18.072 --> 01:14:19.113]  It's about control.
[01:14:19.113 --> 01:14:23.895]  And so we built this nation and had, on average, 10% growth rates every year until 1913.
[01:14:23.895 --> 01:14:29.338]  Now we have, what, 2-3% a year or less?
[01:14:29.338 --> 01:14:31.419]  And that's Cook numbers?
[01:14:31.419 --> 01:14:34.440]  There's hundreds of constitutional taxes and they've got all those in.
[01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:38.862]  And they're bringing in, when I say hundreds, fines, fees, things tacked on.
[01:14:38.862 --> 01:14:41.464]  Hundreds of new taxes that are unconstitutional.
[01:14:41.464 --> 01:14:43.225]  And yes, it's so criminal
[01:14:44.124 --> 01:14:53.812]  Through the Commerce Clause, which has no authority to say, you will buy health insurance and we will take your paycheck, we will take your tax refund, no judge, no jury, no nothing.
[01:14:53.812 --> 01:14:57.255]  I mean, a cop can't pull you over and just take your wallet because they feel like it.
[01:14:57.255 --> 01:15:00.878]  And the IRS can't just show up and take something from you just because they feel like it.
[01:15:00.878 --> 01:15:01.719]  No due process.
[01:15:09.881 --> 01:15:12.425]  And it goes on and on and on.
[01:15:12.425 --> 01:15:14.668]  In fact, let me just read to you here.
[01:15:14.668 --> 01:15:16.090]  This is out of the Hill newspaper.
[01:15:16.090 --> 01:15:23.381]  Republicans assail IRS provision in health care bill.
[01:15:23.381 --> 01:15:25.043]  And quoting from the bill.
[01:15:27.421 --> 01:15:32.724]  The bill would allow the IRS to confiscate refunds if there are penalties for not buying health care.
[01:15:32.724 --> 01:15:33.925]  And I actually read the subsection.
[01:15:33.925 --> 01:15:39.509]  It just says they can whatever powers they want, including seizing bank accounts, garnishing wages.
[01:15:41.656 --> 01:15:48.761]  Lawmakers have questioned whether the IRS can handle the increased workload to oversee, administer, and collect penalties from people who don't buy health care insurance.
[01:15:48.761 --> 01:15:56.407]  See, they didn't ask a few years ago about the REAL ID Act, federalized local IDs, whether it was constitutional to have a national ID card under international treaty.
[01:15:56.407 --> 01:15:57.708]  It's really international.
[01:15:57.708 --> 01:15:59.629]  They said, oh, can we administer it?
[01:15:59.629 --> 01:16:08.035]  So, see, the article diverts off and distracts off into, oh, can we handle this?
[01:16:08.035 --> 01:16:10.077]  Of course the IRS can handle grabbing your money.
[01:16:10.077 --> 01:16:10.497]  They love it.
[01:16:13.254 --> 01:16:18.657]  This is an increased tax liability and tax securities representative Peter Roskam.
[01:16:18.657 --> 01:16:29.563]  Ranking member Dave Camp said many Americans have already rejected the call for health care reform from other reasons and the expansion of the IRS should only add to the kill the bill.
[01:16:29.563 --> 01:16:31.904]  Meanwhile I'm reading from a transcript of Rush Limbaugh yesterday.
[01:16:34.232 --> 01:16:35.713]  This is an overthrow of the U.S.
[01:16:35.713 --> 01:16:40.614]  Constitutional System orchestrated from the White House through the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid.
[01:16:40.614 --> 01:16:42.055]  That's what's going on here.
[01:16:42.055 --> 01:16:45.856]  He went on to say it's criminal.
[01:16:45.856 --> 01:16:47.657]  Well, it is criminal.
[01:16:47.657 --> 01:16:54.139]  But, Limbaugh, so was the Patriot Act, Section 802, written for the American people for all misdemeanors.
[01:16:54.139 --> 01:16:55.360]  So is torture.
[01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:56.100]  So is NORTHCOM.
[01:16:58.131 --> 01:17:03.037]  But you'll stand there with an American flag over your shoulder, and it's supposedly all okay.
[01:17:03.037 --> 01:17:11.227]  No, you help do this, Limbaugh!
[01:17:11.227 --> 01:17:14.971]  You butcher any of the Bill of Rights, they set the precedent to butcher it all, and they will.
[01:17:16.021 --> 01:17:20.366]  You let tyrants get away with it, they will take you all the way down.
[01:17:20.366 --> 01:17:23.690]  It'd be like if they legalized for a month bank robbery.
[01:17:23.690 --> 01:17:25.693]  Every bank in the country would be robbed every day.
[01:17:25.693 --> 01:17:26.914]  The banks would shut down.
[01:17:26.914 --> 01:17:28.156]  The country would collapse.
[01:17:28.156 --> 01:17:30.198]  Just like Mexico, just like North Korea.
[01:17:30.198 --> 01:17:34.143]  You let corrupt come in, they take over, rob everybody, till everybody's slaves.
[01:17:34.924 --> 01:17:38.407]  And the only way these systems work is to make you like barn animals.
[01:17:38.407 --> 01:17:51.157]  Most people in North Korea live in camps, and one week out of the year, they medically monitor you, they stick you in a pen with a woman, like you're a chicken and a rooster, and they take your baby at birth and ship it to another part of the country.
[01:17:51.157 --> 01:17:52.858]  And they're raising slave pens.
[01:17:52.858 --> 01:17:54.260]  That's on record!
[01:17:54.260 --> 01:17:56.061]  The only way slavery works is 100%.
[01:17:56.061 --> 01:17:56.621]  And so they gotta go for 100%.
[01:18:01.425 --> 01:18:09.530]  And our own government says they want to break up the family, they want to brainwash everybody, they want to drug everyone, and they've already gotten a long way towards it.
[01:18:09.530 --> 01:18:12.232]  Look, tyrants are the same the world over.
[01:18:12.232 --> 01:18:14.653]  And now we're in the 21st century.
[01:18:14.653 --> 01:18:14.673]  2010!
[01:18:14.673 --> 01:18:16.334]  2010!
[01:18:16.334 --> 01:18:31.163]  And all the technological systems are being used not to empower the species, but to enslave it, and commit it, imprison it, damn all of us, to a nightmare system.
[01:18:37.365 --> 01:18:43.170]  Oh, and Obama doesn't care if his approval rating's fallen even lower and Congress has the lowest ever according to Gallup.
[01:18:43.170 --> 01:18:45.132]  They don't care, they're a military operation.
[01:18:45.132 --> 01:18:49.055]  They don't care if their enemy doesn't like them.
[01:18:49.055 --> 01:18:56.641]  And then they'll fool you with a Republican, a new enemy general in a few years, and oh, then you'll figure out they're scamming and they'll put in a new enemy general, a Democrat.
[01:18:56.641 --> 01:19:00.724]  But see, very quickly that illusion's evaporating.
[01:19:00.724 --> 01:19:03.767]  That's why Republican and Democratic incumbents are in trouble everywhere.
[01:19:03.767 --> 01:19:04.568]  Look at Kentucky.
[01:19:05.305 --> 01:19:11.711]  And the neocons are coming out against Rand Paul.
[01:19:11.711 --> 01:19:14.033]  But AP actually told the truth.
[01:19:14.033 --> 01:19:14.954]  Fact check.
[01:19:14.954 --> 01:19:17.116]  Premiums would rise under Obama plan.
[01:19:17.116 --> 01:19:18.638]  Of course everybody's premiums.
[01:19:18.638 --> 01:19:22.701]  And what the last caller mentioned about how this hits the poorest people.
[01:19:23.692 --> 01:19:36.598]  I've seen masses of mainstream articles where in the last decade they've taken almost all the IRS investigators off of billionaires and big companies and Fortune 500 and put them on to people who are blue-collar, not even middle class.
[01:19:36.598 --> 01:19:46.583]  That's like a four cents bill in a car wash in Sacramento last week and they sent two armed agents yelling at the guy over four cents.
[01:19:47.967 --> 01:19:51.029]  See, so they're all busy getting four cents from you.
[01:19:51.029 --> 01:19:53.071]  Meanwhile, all the big bankers are above the law.
[01:19:53.071 --> 01:19:55.212]  This is the essence of tyranny.
[01:19:55.212 --> 01:19:57.734]  Unjust weights and measures.
[01:19:57.734 --> 01:19:58.775]  And that's what this bill does.
[01:19:58.775 --> 01:20:01.837]  It makes the unions exempt from it.
[01:20:01.837 --> 01:20:02.998]  What's your home worth?
[01:20:02.998 --> 01:20:05.099]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[01:20:05.099 --> 01:20:07.821]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?

[01:22:01.704 --> 01:22:04.025]  Good day, Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[01:22:04.025 --> 01:22:04.365]  March 19th, 2010.
[01:22:04.365 --> 01:22:05.365]  Gold opened this morning at $11.2310.
[01:22:05.365 --> 01:22:08.547]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $11.5372, $5.7686 for a half ounce, or $2.8843 for the quarter ounce.
[01:22:08.547 --> 01:22:09.147]  That's $11.5372, $5.7686, and $2.8843.
[01:22:21.071 --> 01:22:31.602]  On June 4th, 1963, Executive Order 11110 was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest.
[01:22:31.602 --> 01:22:34.825]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[01:22:34.825 --> 01:22:38.229]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[01:22:38.229 --> 01:22:41.032]  However, the Executive Order still stands unrepealed.
[01:22:41.232 --> 01:22:43.995]  Midas has the Kennedy vs. Fed document.
[01:22:43.995 --> 01:22:46.958]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:46.958 --> 01:22:49.301]  Unlike your liberty, the paper is free.
[01:22:49.301 --> 01:22:50.162]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:50.162 --> 01:22:55.928]  If you're interested in breaking the bondage of taxation and debt, call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:55.928 --> 01:22:56.108]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:23:01.673 --> 01:23:05.214]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[01:23:05.214 --> 01:23:07.515]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[01:23:07.515 --> 01:23:08.375]  Don't!
[01:23:08.375 --> 01:23:11.816]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[01:23:11.816 --> 01:23:18.938]  Why pay, when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[01:23:18.918 --> 01:23:20.899]  's number one debt secret.
[01:23:20.899 --> 01:23:24.980]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[01:23:24.980 --> 01:23:27.681]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[01:23:28.101 --> 01:23:35.484]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[01:23:35.484 --> 01:23:36.684]  Herb K was right.
[01:23:36.684 --> 01:23:39.865]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[01:23:39.865 --> 01:23:41.206]  What have you got to lose?
[01:23:41.206 --> 01:23:44.347]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money!
[01:23:44.927 --> 01:23:46.188]  Don't call your name out my window, I'm leavin'.
[01:23:46.188 --> 01:23:47.088]  I won't even turn my head.
[01:24:12.645 --> 01:24:17.212]  Don't call my name out your window when I'm leaving.
[01:24:19.103 --> 01:24:23.667]  Don't send your kin, folks.
[01:24:23.667 --> 01:24:24.507]  I'll be gone.
[01:24:24.507 --> 01:24:27.450]  Yeah, you'll be saying the same old thing.
[01:24:27.450 --> 01:24:30.473]  Lay there in your bed, pouting.
[01:24:44.245 --> 01:24:50.626]  I want to tell you, do you think Johnny Cash has been around a few women?
[01:24:50.626 --> 01:24:52.566]  Bad mouth!
[01:24:52.566 --> 01:25:02.468]  Alright, a little bit of gallows humor here, folks.
[01:25:02.468 --> 01:25:07.309]  Alright, coming up, I'm going to get into the cyber security situation.
[01:25:07.309 --> 01:25:07.989]  We're on the bill.
[01:25:07.989 --> 01:25:09.689]  Let's go back to your calls.
[01:25:09.689 --> 01:25:12.450]  Deborah in Wisconsin, you're on the air.
[01:25:13.308 --> 01:25:14.669]  Hi Alex, how are you today?
[01:25:14.669 --> 01:25:16.570]  I'm good, welcome.
[01:25:16.570 --> 01:25:20.752]  Hey, talk is cheap, free speech sure isn't anymore, is it?
[01:25:20.752 --> 01:25:33.458]  I'm calling regarding all these people who are out there fighting and going up against us who want free speech, who want to defeat this health care bill.
[01:25:33.458 --> 01:25:37.520]  And now in our state, now they're saying, no, we don't want it, we don't want it.
[01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:43.003]  The same people who we went to for help when we were being attacked because we were saying
[01:25:43.786 --> 01:25:47.928]  For so long that we're trying to defeat this.
[01:25:47.928 --> 01:26:06.939]  So I don't understand why they can go out and- I've tried all these years, there's no new world order, 9-11 isn't an inside job, there's no Operation Northwoods, the government's not too big, the Patriot Act's not bad, this doesn't violate the Constitution, that doesn't violate it, now they get to go into full slavery!
[01:26:06.939 --> 01:26:08.920]  And this is only the beginning!
[01:26:08.920 --> 01:26:09.980]  Unbelievable.
[01:26:09.980 --> 01:26:10.841]  I just can't believe it.
[01:26:10.841 --> 01:26:11.721]  I just wanted to say that.
[01:26:11.721 --> 01:26:13.122]  It's just so ironic now
[01:26:13.700 --> 01:26:17.941]  They're fighting the same gravy train they've been living off for years.
[01:26:17.941 --> 01:26:19.681]  And now the gravy train's over.
[01:26:19.681 --> 01:26:23.042]  The eugenics, death care is taking over.
[01:26:23.042 --> 01:26:26.643]  It doesn't matter if Tom Daschle said, old people have a duty to die.
[01:26:26.643 --> 01:26:27.843]  That's a quote.
[01:26:27.843 --> 01:26:29.824]  Doesn't matter if they're going to start rationing care.
[01:26:29.824 --> 01:26:32.444]  Doesn't matter if that's in the Seattle Times today.
[01:26:32.444 --> 01:26:38.166]  Walgreens, no new Medicaid patients as of April 16th.
[01:26:38.166 --> 01:26:39.066]  Yeah.
[01:26:39.066 --> 01:26:39.546]  Doesn't matter.
[01:26:39.546 --> 01:26:40.866]  I appreciate your call, Deborah.
[01:26:40.866 --> 01:26:42.287]  Dylan in South Carolina.
[01:26:42.287 --> 01:26:43.107]  Dylan, you're on the air.
[01:26:44.335 --> 01:26:45.736]  Hey, how you doing Alex?
[01:26:45.736 --> 01:26:47.616]  Good.
[01:26:47.616 --> 01:26:52.018]  I was calling you, I got a question, a few questions to ask you.
[01:26:52.018 --> 01:26:55.399]  One is on the topic of cyber security since we're talking about it.
[01:26:55.399 --> 01:27:08.264]  A true story for you, it's probably going to be kind of funny, but I was sitting here doing some research this morning on my laptop for a term paper and it was on cyber security and homeland security of all things.
[01:27:08.264 --> 01:27:10.565]  And they flashed a message up that you were being watched.
[01:27:11.747 --> 01:27:13.308]  Uh, well, sort of like that.
[01:27:13.308 --> 01:27:19.032]  Just like when you go to the Cash for Clunkers program, it says, your computer is now the government property.
[01:27:19.032 --> 01:27:21.453]  We are in control of your computer.
[01:27:21.453 --> 01:27:21.854]  Right.
[01:27:21.854 --> 01:27:31.620]  And also, the electric company showed up at my door, of all things, saying that they had had some problems with the security light out in our front yard.
[01:27:31.620 --> 01:27:34.802]  And they didn't have an address on the work order, or anything like that.
[01:27:34.802 --> 01:27:37.724]  And all of a sudden, I'm looking in my front yard, and two trucks.
[01:27:38.268 --> 01:27:42.251]  Or sit out here in our yard and install a new light with no work order or anything.
[01:27:42.251 --> 01:27:45.694]  Well what they're doing is they send them out to innocent people's houses all day.
[01:27:45.694 --> 01:27:49.637]  The cable companies, the power companies, they all get massive cash.
[01:27:49.637 --> 01:27:50.918]  They're all spying on you.
[01:27:50.918 --> 01:27:54.061]  Marijuana, spanking your kids, yelling at your wife.
[01:27:54.061 --> 01:27:58.084]  Just the whole country turning into nothing but pure Nazi spies.
[01:27:58.084 --> 01:27:59.525]  I appreciate your call.
[01:27:59.525 --> 01:28:01.027]  It's all part of freedom.
[01:28:01.027 --> 01:28:02.248]  It's all part of freedom.
[01:28:02.248 --> 01:28:04.129]  Kyle in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[01:28:04.129 --> 01:28:06.071]  Hey Alex, how are you today?
[01:28:07.074 --> 01:28:13.198]  I read somewhere that a family is only going to be able to have $5,000 worth of health care a year.
[01:28:21.673 --> 01:28:24.934]  Yeah, they're going to decide how much health care you can have.
[01:28:24.934 --> 01:28:31.196]  It's all written by the insurance companies where everybody has to pay more on average and then get less care and be ripped off.
[01:28:31.196 --> 01:28:41.139]  That's why the insurance company, uh, you know, big owners like Warren Buffett are just, you know, their stocks are just exploding and it's all just a big giant joke.
[01:28:41.139 --> 01:28:47.901]  Well, I was at the hospital like a month ago to get my finger to a couple of stitches in it and it cost me $446, I think.
[01:28:50.725 --> 01:28:51.646]  Well, that's nothing.
[01:28:51.646 --> 01:28:54.488]  When they're done, it'll cost you ten grand.
[01:28:54.488 --> 01:29:01.052]  I mean, yeah, and like, someone with cancer, they're going to last a month and then they're going to be out of health care?
[01:29:01.052 --> 01:29:02.653]  Well, it's the new system.
[01:29:02.653 --> 01:29:07.356]  You know, we've got to get the American people dependent and got to bankrupt things further so the banks can take over.
[01:29:07.356 --> 01:29:14.121]  And, you know, they've promised to give all our natural resources and infrastructure over to foreign companies as collateral that buy our debt.
[01:29:14.121 --> 01:29:17.103]  And that's now happening, all the major ports, everything.
[01:29:17.103 --> 01:29:18.964]  And it just continues.
[01:29:20.635 --> 01:29:21.817]  I'm going to cover some of that.
[01:29:21.817 --> 01:29:23.980]  I'm going to cover some of that when we come back.
[01:29:23.980 --> 01:29:25.181]  For decades, U.S.
[01:29:25.181 --> 01:29:30.308]  companies aren't allowed to drill in the Gulf of Mexico, but the Chinese, the Russians, they're all allowed to.
[01:29:30.308 --> 01:29:33.091]  See, it's all about destroying America.
[01:29:33.091 --> 01:29:33.492]  Literally.
[01:29:35.103 --> 01:29:36.924]  I appreciate your call.
[01:29:36.924 --> 01:29:40.106]  Alright, Zach, Jason, Jason, others, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:29:40.106 --> 01:29:43.067]  We are live!
[01:29:43.067 --> 01:29:46.549]  It is Friday, the 19th day of March, 2010.
[01:29:46.549 --> 01:29:49.411]  PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com are the websites.
[01:29:49.411 --> 01:29:51.512]  We've got a key trailer coming up.
[01:29:51.512 --> 01:29:52.913]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.913 --> 01:29:55.434]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.434 --> 01:29:58.136]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:31:07.669 --> 01:31:12.812]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:31:12.812 --> 01:31:21.538]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:31:21.538 --> 01:31:25.601]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:31:25.601 --> 01:31:27.863]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[01:31:29.895 --> 01:31:34.618]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[01:31:34.618 --> 01:31:39.700]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it, others don't.
[01:31:39.700 --> 01:31:41.841]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:31:41.841 --> 01:31:43.622]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:31:43.622 --> 01:31:46.504]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.

[01:32:01.624 --> 01:32:04.205]  The end is near.
[01:32:04.205 --> 01:32:06.385]  No, this is not a new age prophecy.
[01:32:06.385 --> 01:32:07.586]  I'm Steve Schenck.

[01:32:48.742 --> 01:32:52.246]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[01:33:14.744 --> 01:33:19.782]  On a lonely, lonesome highway East of Omaha
[01:33:22.025 --> 01:33:26.126]  Alright, I'm going to play the audio because we're not live at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[01:33:26.126 --> 01:33:40.771]  Of the new official The Big Kahuna Trail, there'll be a few more in the next few weeks for Invisible Empire, a New World Order defined 2-hour, 20-plus minute film, 18 months, made in our office with Jason Bermas and others.
[01:33:40.771 --> 01:33:44.513]  It is a powerful new film, covers a host of issues.
[01:33:44.513 --> 01:33:45.553]  It's going to be a big'un.
[01:33:45.553 --> 01:33:49.274]  You can pre-order it now, so it's shipped out to you first at InfoWars.com.
[01:33:51.732 --> 01:33:58.699]  Let's go ahead and play that trailer now.
[01:33:58.699 --> 01:34:02.662]  You know, there is such a thing as insidious influence.
[01:34:02.662 --> 01:34:05.665]  Does it involve bribery?
[01:34:05.665 --> 01:34:09.689]  Does it involve some sort of psychological domination of individuals?
[01:34:10.871 --> 01:34:14.415]  But what does a new world order mean for countries like ours?
[01:34:14.415 --> 01:34:15.476]  A new world order.
[01:34:15.476 --> 01:34:21.342]  No world order that elevates one nation or group of people over another will succeed.
[01:34:21.342 --> 01:34:25.185]  It's a phrase that I often use myself, that we needed a new world order.
[01:34:25.185 --> 01:34:28.969]  So it's going to be an inter-ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:34:29.890 --> 01:34:31.411]  And I got news for you.
[01:34:31.411 --> 01:34:32.491]  You're everyone else.
[01:34:32.491 --> 01:34:35.632]  The whole concept of New World Order is something else.
[01:34:35.632 --> 01:34:37.913]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:34:37.913 --> 01:34:47.336]  You take the roots of that organization and you find out that they created in all of the British dependencies what they call round table groups.
[01:34:47.336 --> 01:34:50.477]  Then around those little round table groups they created front groups.
[01:34:50.854 --> 01:34:53.475]  We're getting to two levels of government here.
[01:34:53.475 --> 01:35:03.699]  One level of government where we have checks and balances, and a higher level of COG government where the constitutional authorities are not allowed to go.
[01:35:03.699 --> 01:35:09.821]  Back then, it wasn't politically wise to be aligned with what his party's right wing considered a shadow world government.
[01:35:09.821 --> 01:35:14.003]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:35:14.463 --> 01:35:17.485]  This is the third leg of the New World Order.
[01:35:17.485 --> 01:35:18.926]  That's why it's important.
[01:35:18.926 --> 01:35:27.731]  The people running this country are determined to destroy it.
[01:35:27.731 --> 01:35:36.977]  The people running this country are determined to destroy it.
[01:35:36.977 --> 01:35:39.919]  They gave the Panama Canal that we built to the Communist Chinese.
[01:35:42.898 --> 01:35:50.420]  Washington Times, Obama surrenders Gulf oil to Moscow.
[01:35:50.420 --> 01:35:58.502]  The Obama administration is poised to ban offshore drilling in an even wider area on the outer continental shelf until 2012 or beyond.
[01:35:58.502 --> 01:36:03.703]  Meanwhile, Russia is making a bold strategic leap to begin drilling for oil in the Gulf of Mexico.
[01:36:03.703 --> 01:36:12.365]  While the United States attempts to shift gears to alternative fuels to battle the purported evils of carbon emissions, Russia will enact oil derricks, will erect them,
[01:36:13.681 --> 01:36:17.244]  Off the Cuban coast.
[01:36:17.244 --> 01:36:28.573]  There's one 644 square mile area right off the coast of Louisiana, discovered in the 70s, that has more oil, get ready for this, than Saudi Arabia.
[01:36:28.573 --> 01:36:30.575]  Probably more than Alaska.
[01:36:30.575 --> 01:36:33.037]  We can't have it!
[01:36:33.037 --> 01:36:37.280]  But the Chicoms and the Cubans can.
[01:36:37.280 --> 01:36:39.802]  Mexico signed a deal, what, four years ago,
[01:36:40.612 --> 01:36:45.856]  With the Chinese to move into their areas, but we can't have ours.
[01:36:45.856 --> 01:36:49.519]  And so the corporations move offshore.
[01:36:49.519 --> 01:36:53.842]  Halliburton, all of them.
[01:36:53.842 --> 01:36:57.905]  Halliburton helps give nuclear weapons parts and oil field equipment to Iran.
[01:36:57.905 --> 01:36:59.706]  Oh, but they're not traitors.
[01:36:59.706 --> 01:37:03.149]  If I say I don't want to attack Iran, I'm a traitor.
[01:37:03.149 --> 01:37:07.212]  Or if I don't want to give Moscow our oil, well, that's evil.
[01:37:09.261 --> 01:37:22.497]  But if I go on Russian TV and speak out against the New World Order and say we shouldn't have cyber security takeover, they have neocons come out and say, Alex Jones, Ruski agent.
[01:37:22.497 --> 01:37:24.038]  This is how the idiocy works.
[01:37:24.038 --> 01:37:26.862]  And hey, the Russians, they're getting their people oil.
[01:37:29.414 --> 01:37:31.616]  The Russians pay their people to have children.
[01:37:31.616 --> 01:37:33.799]  Our government pays you not to.
[01:37:33.799 --> 01:37:35.921]  And it's moving towards a one-child policy.
[01:37:35.921 --> 01:37:46.211]  But I guess if the Russians are against abortion, I better be for it, or then I'm a rooskie, right?
[01:37:46.211 --> 01:37:49.735]  The New World Order, the people running this country, are determined to destroy it.
[01:37:53.871 --> 01:37:57.313]  I'm going to go through some news and then to Zach, Jason, Jason, Mike, and David.
[01:37:57.313 --> 01:37:59.515]  That'll probably be it for calls this hour.
[01:37:59.515 --> 01:38:02.817]  We've got some guests coming up you don't want to miss in the third and fourth hour.
[01:38:02.817 --> 01:38:10.321]  But I wanted to thank some of the sponsors that made today's radio show possible.
[01:38:10.321 --> 01:38:14.324]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:38:14.324 --> 01:38:15.705]  They're made in America in Tennessee.
[01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:17.440]  I wear them.
[01:38:17.440 --> 01:38:19.161]  They sent me free pairs like four years ago.
[01:38:19.161 --> 01:38:21.022]  It's all made right here in America.
[01:38:21.022 --> 01:38:23.323]  The cloth, the sewing, they're high quality.
[01:38:23.323 --> 01:38:23.843]  They look great.
[01:38:23.843 --> 01:38:25.123]  They're basically like Levi's.
[01:38:25.123 --> 01:38:25.944]  They don't fall apart.
[01:38:25.944 --> 01:38:28.685]  Now Levi's are made in Mexico.
[01:38:28.685 --> 01:38:30.325]  Go to gussetclothing.com.
[01:38:30.325 --> 01:38:35.867]  G-U-S-S-E-T gussetclothing.com today.
[01:38:35.867 --> 01:38:38.628]  It's made in America.
[01:38:38.628 --> 01:38:40.509]  I mean, do people care and want to keep their jobs?
[01:38:40.509 --> 01:38:42.450]  You better start trying to buy American when you can.
[01:38:44.246 --> 01:38:45.486]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:38:45.486 --> 01:38:49.847]  They got motorcycle jeans, regular jeans, bunch of different clothing lines.
[01:38:49.847 --> 01:38:54.609]  These are tough jeans, folks.
[01:38:54.609 --> 01:38:58.710]  Gussetclothing.com.
[01:38:58.710 --> 01:38:59.450]  You've heard the ad.
[01:38:59.450 --> 01:39:01.170]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:39:01.170 --> 01:39:05.312]  There's a place down in Tennessee.
[01:39:05.312 --> 01:39:10.513]  Gussetclothing.com.
[01:39:10.513 --> 01:39:10.793]  Okay.
[01:39:14.810 --> 01:39:31.354]  You heard that clip in the piece we just played, the trailer for Invisible Empire, where Obama at the UN a few months ago says, no new world order will succeed that has any other nation above any other.
[01:39:31.354 --> 01:39:32.254]  That means financially.
[01:39:32.254 --> 01:39:34.655]  That's what the CFR, the UN have all said.
[01:39:34.655 --> 01:39:38.756]  Deindustrialize Europe, England, Canada, the United States, Australia, New Zealand.
[01:39:41.343 --> 01:39:43.305]  But also keep the third world low.
[01:39:43.305 --> 01:39:45.586]  That's what the Copenhagen Treaty said.
[01:39:45.586 --> 01:39:46.687]  Right at double.
[01:39:46.687 --> 01:39:48.669]  Not quite double, right at double.
[01:39:48.669 --> 01:39:50.130]  One point from doubling.
[01:39:50.130 --> 01:39:51.972]  The tax is on the third world that's on us.
[01:39:54.206 --> 01:39:58.627]  Totally keeping them in the dark ages and lowering us close to their level.
[01:39:58.627 --> 01:40:10.471]  That's why they want the open borders to drive down the wages so no one has a chance to escape, so there's no tax haven as the Organization of Economic Cooperative Development, big UN receivership body says.
[01:40:10.471 --> 01:40:13.711]  They want our taxes roughly at about 80% like France's.
[01:40:13.711 --> 01:40:15.332]  That, they say, France is the model.
[01:40:16.553 --> 01:40:18.054]  So is Finland.
[01:40:18.054 --> 01:40:19.415]  All your money is in bank accounts.
[01:40:19.415 --> 01:40:21.637]  The government takes it out whenever they want.
[01:40:21.637 --> 01:40:22.998]  Everyone's phones are listened to.
[01:40:22.998 --> 01:40:24.298]  The government brags about it.
[01:40:24.298 --> 01:40:26.440]  They call it safety.
[01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:29.122]  This is the model.
[01:40:29.122 --> 01:40:37.988]  So I saw idiots commenting on the YouTube channel with the trailer going, well, this sounds good, but Obama says a new world order, no country being above another.
[01:40:37.988 --> 01:40:39.029]  That means financially.
[01:40:40.623 --> 01:40:41.964]  That's what Copenhagen is.
[01:40:41.964 --> 01:40:47.207]  China, India, Mexico, and a hundred plus other nations have to make no carbon cuts.
[01:40:47.207 --> 01:40:50.669]  Every industrialized country does.
[01:40:50.669 --> 01:40:55.392]  So if you're a selected country to destroy the West industrial base, you have to make no cuts.
[01:40:55.392 --> 01:40:58.474]  If you're a third world country that's not developed, massive cuts.
[01:40:58.474 --> 01:41:00.475]  If you're a first world country, massive cuts.
[01:41:00.475 --> 01:41:08.560]  It's those middle tyranny engines, Mexico, China, and others that are just absolutely above the law.
[01:41:12.185 --> 01:41:15.027]  And Mexico is the cancer meant to bring down America.
[01:41:15.027 --> 01:41:23.832]  Totally collapsed, totally enslaved people, the police machine gun anybody that protests, total tyranny, 19,000 murdered the last three years and growing.
[01:41:23.832 --> 01:41:32.677]  Americans being slaughtered everywhere, all kept on the lowdown, the DL.
[01:41:32.677 --> 01:41:36.360]  And nobody can stand up in Latin America because they're so poor, and that's the tool.
[01:41:36.360 --> 01:41:39.922]  They won't make you real poor, and you go to the government for your health care and everything else.
[01:41:46.158 --> 01:41:47.139]  Now, look at this article.
[01:41:47.139 --> 01:41:49.121]  We've been telling you this for years.
[01:41:49.121 --> 01:41:56.147]  From the government documents, the Pentagon's saying they're going to target American bloggers, disinfo, they're going to attack us, they're going to infiltrate our groups.
[01:41:56.147 --> 01:42:05.396]  Cass Sunstein says they're going to carry out violence, to radicalize our groups, in the Fed groups, 9-11 truth groups, anti-global warming tax groups, they list them all.
[01:42:05.396 --> 01:42:07.057]  You are the enemy!
[01:42:07.057 --> 01:42:08.419]  The Pentagon report says it.
[01:42:08.419 --> 01:42:12.002]  The British one I covered two days ago with Alan Watt says you're the enemy.
[01:42:14.775 --> 01:42:19.439]  They're just getting you trained to the troops being on the streets and the government controlling your thermostat and running your life.
[01:42:19.439 --> 01:42:23.923]  Pentagon seeks... Pentagon sees a threat from online muckrakers.
[01:42:23.923 --> 01:42:25.905]  New York Times!
[01:42:25.905 --> 01:42:35.394]  To the list of enemies threatening the security of the United States, the Pentagon has added WikiLeaks, a tiny online source of information and documents that governments and corporations around the world prefer to keep secret.
[01:42:35.394 --> 01:42:39.418]  The Army Report linked it as an enemy to be taken on and knocked off balance.
[01:42:42.216 --> 01:42:47.401]  And who do we see getting banned in New Zealand when they flipped on the censorship system a few weeks ago, until people protested?
[01:42:47.401 --> 01:42:53.426]  Wikileaks, Infowars.com, PresentPlanet.com, Krypton.
[01:42:53.426 --> 01:42:55.869]  And what did Wikileaks put out to make the Pentagon so mad?
[01:42:55.869 --> 01:42:59.152]  All these secret reports about their spying on the American people.
[01:42:59.152 --> 01:43:00.813]  They go to churches and spy on you.
[01:43:00.813 --> 01:43:01.934]  Everybody gets spied on.
[01:43:01.934 --> 01:43:03.836]  Pentagon's everywhere.
[01:43:03.836 --> 01:43:05.818]  They run the local environmental takeover in Austin.
[01:43:08.752 --> 01:43:17.384]  Now, but don't worry, Obama was going to have total unilateral control to shut the web down without Congress, but now it says he can appoint a board.
[01:43:17.384 --> 01:43:21.489]  He appoints them, and then they make a recommendation, and then he makes the decision.
[01:43:21.489 --> 01:43:23.492]  Cybersecurity bill introduced in the Senate.
[01:43:23.492 --> 01:43:23.793]  Reuters.
[01:43:28.860 --> 01:43:34.924]  It says, one major change to the bill is that the President would no longer have the power to shut down the Internet unilaterally.
[01:43:34.924 --> 01:43:35.485]  Oh!
[01:43:35.485 --> 01:43:42.230]  But would have to work with industry, because they're the new government, to draw up plans in the event of a national emergency.
[01:43:42.230 --> 01:43:47.653]  But then the President makes the decision, so it's the same thing.
[01:43:47.653 --> 01:43:50.615]  Here it is, Emergency Internet Control Bill gets a rewrite.
[01:43:50.615 --> 01:43:53.578]  CNET News, it goes on to say, it still does the same thing.
[01:43:54.420 --> 01:44:01.246]  Meanwhile, England announced a year ago the naked body scanners, and then I told you they would then say, by the way, everyone must do it.
[01:44:01.246 --> 01:44:11.514]  First they put in a few, get you trained, it's only random, then it's everybody, then it's mobile trucks in England and the U.S., Homeland Security has announced.
[01:44:11.514 --> 01:44:21.883]  And Homeland Security is driving around, running around, everywhere saying it's sports stadiums everywhere else, and on the video they put out, they show them interrogating a woman, and they say, are you bringing a recording device in the concert?
[01:44:21.883 --> 01:44:22.684]  See, that's terrorism.
[01:44:25.539 --> 01:44:27.040]  It's all dog training, incremental.
[01:44:27.040 --> 01:44:29.261]  Well, here it is, herald.net.
[01:44:29.261 --> 01:44:33.723]  Body scans eventually mandatory, TSA official says.
[01:44:33.723 --> 01:44:35.104]  Chicago.
[01:44:35.104 --> 01:44:39.426]  There's another one, Chicago Tribune, same headline.
[01:44:39.426 --> 01:44:44.808]  Currently, air travelers have the option to submit to pat-downs and metal detecting wanding.
[01:44:44.808 --> 01:44:46.349]  All airline passengers in the U.S.
[01:44:46.349 --> 01:44:50.331]  will eventually be required... Get Aaron in here now, about what happened to him just briefly.
[01:44:50.331 --> 01:44:51.952]  We'll talk more about it Sunday.
[01:44:51.952 --> 01:44:52.792]  I forgot to tell him to get in here.
[01:44:54.412 --> 01:44:56.934]  Aaron was flying back from interviewing Lord Moncton in D.C.
[01:44:56.934 --> 01:45:07.001]  with Rob Due, and they set up like the media does in the news, about 50 feet back, to show the scanners, and the guy ran over and said, turn your cameras off, or you will never fly again.
[01:45:07.001 --> 01:45:08.522]  No judge, no jury, he's God.
[01:45:08.522 --> 01:45:14.106]  Aaron stood up to him and said no, and unfortunately Aaron was shooting without audio.
[01:45:14.106 --> 01:45:18.028]  These are fancy cameras where you have to set the audio, but Due got up from 50 feet away.
[01:45:18.028 --> 01:45:19.550]  They're looking at it right now to see what they can do.
[01:45:20.336 --> 01:45:26.340]  But the point is, they ran over to him and just said, look buddy, you'll never travel again.
[01:45:26.340 --> 01:45:39.648]  And under the new National ID Act with the healthcare, and this all integrates together, no buying, no selling, you won't have a job, it'll be a felony for your boss if they hire you without that card, but the illegals will all just be legalized and given it, that's in the immigration bill.
[01:45:39.648 --> 01:45:42.770]  So it doesn't stop that.
[01:45:42.770 --> 01:45:49.814]  And they're gonna control your thermostat, your refrigerator, it's all being announced, everything controlled, you're not in good stead, they just turn everything off.
[01:45:50.802 --> 01:45:52.725]  I mean, this is a prison!
[01:45:52.725 --> 01:45:59.315]  Aaron, briefly, before we go back to calls, and good job going to interview Lord Monckton, tell folks the name of the airport, exactly what happened.
[01:45:59.315 --> 01:46:04.662]  You thought you had the audio, you just checked the tape, your audio was off, but dude's 15 feet away, we'll see if we can jack the audio up.
[01:46:04.662 --> 01:46:05.484]  He did get it.
[01:46:05.484 --> 01:46:06.245]  Tell folks what happened.
[01:46:06.724 --> 01:46:12.268]  Yeah, we were at the Baltimore BWI Airport just outside of Washington, D.C.
[01:46:12.268 --> 01:46:13.929]  And by the way, we've been through there before.
[01:46:13.929 --> 01:46:18.372]  They put the body scanners in well before this underwear bomber incident.
[01:46:18.372 --> 01:46:21.153]  This was never about the supposed terrorists.
[01:46:21.153 --> 01:46:25.296]  No, I was watching a documentary about the 20s and the IRA rebellion.
[01:46:25.296 --> 01:46:29.419]  And as an act of submission, they would make the Irishmen always strip naked in the town square.
[01:46:29.739 --> 01:46:32.380]  It's just an act of, I strip you down.
[01:46:32.380 --> 01:46:33.161]  You know, I shave you.
[01:46:33.161 --> 01:46:34.621]  It's like shaving a dog.
[01:46:34.621 --> 01:46:35.822]  It's like a cone of shame.
[01:46:35.822 --> 01:46:37.943]  It's like, look, I'll record your genitals.
[01:46:37.943 --> 01:46:38.343]  Go ahead.
[01:46:38.343 --> 01:46:38.803]  It is, yeah.
[01:46:38.803 --> 01:46:39.944]  This is the same airport.
[01:46:39.944 --> 01:46:46.827]  We refused to go through the body scanners last time, and I was told I read too much, and Rob Doo also refused.
[01:46:46.827 --> 01:46:49.489]  But this time, we weren't randomly selected.
[01:46:49.489 --> 01:46:50.529]  Others were.
[01:46:50.529 --> 01:46:58.353]  We were filming that, and just trying to document the terrible, unwarranted search of- And they let all the media come in, who love them, and film it, but you couldn't.
[01:46:58.633 --> 01:46:59.433]  Right, right.
[01:46:59.433 --> 01:47:04.674]  And they reserve the right to film genitals and naked bodies, but we can't film them doing that.
[01:47:04.674 --> 01:47:10.636]  So this very tall, very overweight guy comes over, obviously trying to intimidate us.
[01:47:10.636 --> 01:47:19.058]  And he comes up to Rob Doof first and begins to tell him he can't film until he notices I'm filming too and decides that I'm probably the bigger problem.
[01:47:19.058 --> 01:47:22.939]  And he comes over to me and starts barking orders at me to stop filming.
[01:47:22.939 --> 01:47:23.839]  And I didn't
[01:47:24.139 --> 01:47:24.619]  I don't know.
[01:47:46.806 --> 01:47:48.527]  And that's Nazi Germany!
[01:47:48.527 --> 01:47:57.473]  First they couldn't have their own businesses, then they had to move out of town, and no judge, no jury, they're saying a no-gun-buy list if you're on this list, a no-work list, I saw Ridge six years ago say it on C-SPAN, this will be total control!
[01:48:15.566 --> 01:48:16.627]  Yeah, and this wasn't a bluff.
[01:48:16.627 --> 01:48:17.747]  This wasn't a random thing.
[01:48:17.747 --> 01:48:20.329]  There's millions of people in the no-fly zone.
[01:48:20.329 --> 01:48:21.870]  At the G20, we called the military base.
[01:48:21.870 --> 01:48:22.370]  We went there.
[01:48:22.370 --> 01:48:23.751]  We said, where are you going to be tomorrow?
[01:48:23.751 --> 01:48:25.632]  We want to interview your spokesman.
[01:48:25.632 --> 01:48:26.892]  And they said, just leave.
[01:48:26.892 --> 01:48:27.613]  We have it all on tape.
[01:48:27.613 --> 01:48:29.054]  It's coming out in Police State 4.
[01:48:29.054 --> 01:48:31.335]  Then they called your hotel and said, you'll never fly again.
[01:48:31.335 --> 01:48:32.255]  Your life's over.
[01:48:32.255 --> 01:48:32.996]  You're a terrorist.
[01:48:33.556 --> 01:48:35.338]  Yeah, they do these threats all over the place.
[01:48:35.338 --> 01:48:35.698]  They love it!
[01:48:35.698 --> 01:48:37.319]  No, this is total bondage.
[01:48:37.319 --> 01:48:40.863]  But this, you want an example of a guy who's using the uniform as power.
[01:48:40.863 --> 01:48:41.924]  This was him.
[01:48:41.924 --> 01:48:42.544]  He's God.
[01:48:42.544 --> 01:48:48.850]  I mean, I mean, we had the TSA guy in Boston charged with child rape now, running the naked body scanner.
[01:48:48.850 --> 01:48:51.953]  Oh yeah, but I've got this poster on the article at InfoWars.
[01:48:51.953 --> 01:48:53.794]  The power of the uniform is the uniform.
[01:48:53.794 --> 01:48:54.615]  That's the tyranny.
[01:48:54.615 --> 01:48:56.337]  The individual has no power.
[01:48:56.337 --> 01:48:57.638]  He's just a worthless
[01:48:57.938 --> 01:48:59.620]  Your article's already up.
[01:48:59.620 --> 01:49:01.142]  Yeah, I just posted it, so.
[01:49:01.142 --> 01:49:02.664]  You're gonna put a video together?
[01:49:02.664 --> 01:49:03.645]  I'll put a video together.
[01:49:03.645 --> 01:49:06.729]  Right now, there's stills up there and you can see who this guy is.
[01:49:06.729 --> 01:49:08.491]  And he's, you know, giant, towering.
[01:49:08.491 --> 01:49:13.557]  He expected to intimidate us, even though Rob Dew's quite tall and I'm not that small of a fellow myself.
[01:49:14.218 --> 01:49:22.265]  But he just couldn't believe that we wouldn't cow to his intimidation and he walked away as soon as I told him, I have a right to travel.
[01:49:22.265 --> 01:49:28.571]  I told him firmly, I wasn't mean, I didn't yell, but I told him, I have a right to travel, this is wrong, you're hurting the country.
[01:49:28.571 --> 01:49:37.259]  Well here's the next issue, now they're saying that they're going to, we've shown the videos, in fact add that to your article, the mobile trucks and
[01:49:39.744 --> 01:49:42.817]  How all over the country they come up and tell you, you can't film here, you can't film there.
[01:49:42.817 --> 01:49:44.464]  I mean, these are out of control thugs.
[01:49:45.270 --> 01:49:49.814]  They really are, but when I firmly told him no, he just walked away.
[01:49:49.814 --> 01:49:51.355]  The threats were over then.
[01:49:51.355 --> 01:49:55.017]  He would have done it if I had, you know... Oh, if you'd have called, they would have arrested you.
[01:49:55.017 --> 01:49:55.798]  Please don't.
[01:49:55.798 --> 01:49:57.379]  If I had done that, I would have been on the list.
[01:49:57.379 --> 01:49:58.580]  Please, I'm a terrorist.
[01:49:58.580 --> 01:49:59.501]  I'm sorry.
[01:49:59.501 --> 01:50:01.002]  But I stood my ground firmly.
[01:50:01.002 --> 01:50:07.667]  I was still relatively polite, but I didn't... I wasn't going to give in to it, and, you know... What's the headline on the article?
[01:50:07.667 --> 01:50:12.371]  The article is, Power-Tripping TSA Thug Threatens to Bar Travel.
[01:50:14.508 --> 01:50:17.170]  And just point out, like, your life's over.
[01:50:17.170 --> 01:50:20.293]  Your right to travel, your right for business, everything's over.
[01:50:20.293 --> 01:50:21.433]  No judge, no jury.
[01:50:21.433 --> 01:50:22.694]  He is God.
[01:50:22.694 --> 01:50:24.075]  He says what you can and can't do.
[01:50:24.075 --> 01:50:26.337]  And remember, folks, this is going to be for everywhere.
[01:50:26.337 --> 01:50:33.903]  This is going to be random checkpoints on the streets, random illegal blood draws, her taking your baby's blood at birth, using school laptops to watch you at home.
[01:50:33.903 --> 01:50:36.225]  I mean, it's unlimited tyranny.
[01:50:36.225 --> 01:50:38.106]  There's no longer any doubt.
[01:50:38.106 --> 01:50:39.687]  And, Aaron, you just keep standing up.
[01:50:39.687 --> 01:50:40.948]  These people like the IRS commissioner.
[01:50:40.948 --> 01:50:41.469]  It was amazing.
[01:50:41.909 --> 01:50:49.271]  I can't take it, because we all know it's incremental and encroachment, and if we don't stand up, it's just going to continue to get worse and worse.
[01:50:49.271 --> 01:50:51.572]  We can already see where it's going to be worse.
[01:50:51.572 --> 01:50:54.592]  Absolutely, and add the video you confront the IRS Commissioner, too.
[01:50:54.592 --> 01:50:55.853]  You are on fire, my friend.
[01:50:55.853 --> 01:50:57.873]  All right, take a few phone calls on the other side.
[01:50:57.873 --> 01:50:59.794]  We've got a special guest coming up.
[01:50:59.794 --> 01:51:00.234]  Stay with us.
[01:51:01.584 --> 01:51:02.885]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.885 --> 01:51:08.469]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:08.469 --> 01:51:13.492]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:13.492 --> 01:51:19.076]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:51:19.076 --> 01:51:23.759]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:24.278 --> 01:51:31.402]  They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:31.402 --> 01:51:32.523]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:32.523 --> 01:51:35.585]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:51:35.585 --> 01:51:39.207]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.

[01:52:16.691 --> 01:52:21.375]  As a homesteader attempting to live sustainably, I was floored by the amount of information in this book.
[01:52:21.375 --> 01:52:25.478]  Dear Linda, I would be hard-pressed to express how much you have impacted my life.
[01:52:25.578 --> 01:52:29.939]  I'm amazed by the wealth of the author's knowledge and the depth of the coverage in this book.
[01:52:29.939 --> 01:52:34.500]  As we see more and more GMO foods on the shelves, this information is good to know.
[01:52:34.500 --> 01:52:36.580]  I am thankful to God for you, Linda.
[01:52:36.580 --> 01:52:38.720]  I can't say enough about this book.
[01:52:38.720 --> 01:52:40.641]  Blessings to you and your family.
[01:52:40.641 --> 01:52:46.362]  The greatest effect this book has had on me and my family is that we truly see Earth's bounty everywhere.

[01:53:39.088 --> 01:53:41.830]  Homeland Security TSA says you'll all be naked body scanned.
[01:53:41.830 --> 01:53:43.070]  It will be mandatory.
[01:54:10.828 --> 01:54:13.689]  We'll be mandatory at warrantless checkpoints to have your blood removed.
[01:54:13.689 --> 01:54:19.272]  They will take your baby's blood at birth and shove a machine gun in your mouth if you don't like it.
[01:54:19.272 --> 01:54:23.694]  They are thugs, they are criminals, they are parasites.
[01:54:23.694 --> 01:54:27.836]  Call Congress, fight the health care bill, call your state houses, get them lined up to say no.
[01:54:30.336 --> 01:54:33.098]  This is your wake-up call, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:54:33.098 --> 01:54:38.423]  And don't forget $15,000 prizes for the Naked Body Scanner protest.
[01:54:38.423 --> 01:54:41.786]  Big banners up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:54:41.786 --> 01:54:42.546]  Get involved in that.
[01:54:42.546 --> 01:54:45.509]  In the next few days, we'll be posting some of the submissions that are coming in.
[01:54:45.509 --> 01:54:46.530]  Great stuff.
[01:54:46.530 --> 01:54:50.333]  Everybody who enters wins, because people see the videos, the material, and it wakes folks up.
[01:54:50.333 --> 01:54:51.834]  We've got to fight back.
[01:54:51.834 --> 01:54:53.295]  Zach in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:54:53.295 --> 01:54:53.636]  Go ahead.
[01:54:54.722 --> 01:54:57.604]  Alex Jones, hello from the Gulf Coast.
[01:54:57.604 --> 01:54:58.685]  Welcome.
[01:54:58.685 --> 01:55:00.906]  I can't wait to see you all tomorrow at the Doubletree.
[01:55:00.906 --> 01:55:05.789]  We're going to come over there to Austin, but what I'm really calling about is the healthcare.
[01:55:05.789 --> 01:55:13.975]  I keep sharing all this with the family and people I know and all that, and they're opposed to it, but they don't want to do nothing.
[01:55:13.975 --> 01:55:20.699]  Is this basically the straw that's going to break the camel's back in conjunction with the amnesty bill that they're trying to start working on next week?
[01:55:20.699 --> 01:55:21.440]  Is this going to be what?
[01:55:22.017 --> 01:55:27.560]  Yes, people don't see themselves in the role of leaders.
[01:55:27.560 --> 01:55:29.981]  And so they don't like it, but they lay there and take it.
[01:55:29.981 --> 01:55:33.743]  And passively going along with something is the same thing as acceptance.
[01:55:33.743 --> 01:55:39.865]  And they have to understand, the government's going to continue to squeeze and bankrupt things and always pose as the savior.
[01:55:39.865 --> 01:55:42.006]  We must get up, we must get moving.
[01:55:42.006 --> 01:55:44.848]  We have to make this be the camel's straw.
[01:55:44.848 --> 01:55:46.909]  The straw that breaks the camel's back.
[01:55:46.909 --> 01:55:47.869]  Zach, thank you.
[01:55:47.869 --> 01:55:49.530]  Jason in Colorado, you're on the air.
[01:55:51.647 --> 01:55:52.368]  Hello?
[01:55:52.368 --> 01:55:53.649]  Yes, sir!
[01:55:53.649 --> 01:55:54.289]  Oh, sorry, sir.
[01:55:54.289 --> 01:55:54.930]  I heard a beep.
[01:55:54.930 --> 01:55:57.612]  Anyway... Welcome worldwide!
[01:55:57.612 --> 01:56:01.295]  Yeah, these guys are just funny with their arrogance, and let me tell you something.
[01:56:01.295 --> 01:56:06.320]  Their undoing is going to be the fact that they are slaves to their arrogance.
[01:56:06.320 --> 01:56:12.705]  And on the health care bill, you mentioned earlier, or Crawler did, on the Idaho to sue feds over health care mandate.
[01:56:12.705 --> 01:56:18.310]  I love how the media is lying about the fact that how the federal law trumps
[01:56:18.851 --> 01:56:26.094]  State law, like the quote, constitutional law experts say the movement is mostly symbolic because federal laws supersede those of the state.
[01:56:26.094 --> 01:56:26.855]  No it doesn't!
[01:56:26.855 --> 01:56:28.636]  It's unconstitutional!
[01:56:28.636 --> 01:56:33.658]  You can't make people buy something and give your money to private companies.
[01:56:33.658 --> 01:56:34.999]  It's slavery!
[01:56:34.999 --> 01:56:36.159]  Jason, I appreciate your call.
[01:56:36.159 --> 01:56:39.721]  Jason in Illinois, you're up next.
[01:56:39.721 --> 01:56:40.601]  Hello.
[01:56:40.601 --> 01:56:42.522]  Yes, sir.
[01:56:42.522 --> 01:56:46.504]  My question was, could the health care bill be used to impose mandatory vaccinations?
[01:56:47.003 --> 01:56:48.223]  Oh, absolutely!
[01:56:48.223 --> 01:56:53.045]  And it's got funding for microchips under the skin, that is in the bill.
[01:56:53.045 --> 01:57:10.330]  They tried forced inoculation in multiple states, New York and Massachusetts, and now they're going to put taxes on you because it's all communalized in this communitarian communist system, where, oh, you're unhealthy so you pay more, so they gotta monitor you to know what you're eating and doing.
[01:57:10.330 --> 01:57:13.710]  Taxes on salt, jail time for salt.
[01:57:13.710 --> 01:57:15.011]  I mean, it's just, it's so
[01:57:16.790 --> 01:57:17.351]  Wow.
[01:57:17.351 --> 01:57:27.243]  I'd just like to say that when the national ID cards do become mandatory, get a gun instead.
[01:57:34.352 --> 01:57:38.816]  I appreciate your call, Jason, but look, they've already federalized in the mid-90s the ID cards.
[01:57:38.816 --> 01:57:41.819]  They told people a few years ago that they federalized it.
[01:57:41.819 --> 01:57:46.803]  Now they're saying they're going to give it all to the illegal aliens and then make you as a citizen have one to have a job.
[01:57:46.803 --> 01:57:53.630]  Not just show your ID, but that you must have this card and then you must have it to go to national parks or fly or live.
[01:57:53.630 --> 01:57:55.191]  It's a hemispheric ID card.
[01:57:55.191 --> 01:57:56.953]  It's the North American Union by stealth.
[01:57:56.953 --> 01:58:00.416]  We have the SPP Banff Canada documents on that.
[01:58:01.400 --> 01:58:03.222]  This is so real!
[01:58:03.222 --> 01:58:03.922]  So what do you do?
[01:58:03.922 --> 01:58:04.743]  You get aggressive.
[01:58:04.743 --> 01:58:05.884]  You wake people up.
[01:58:05.884 --> 01:58:08.346]  The population is now ready to be awakened.
[01:58:08.346 --> 01:58:10.748]  The population is now ready to see the truth.
[01:58:10.748 --> 01:58:19.115]  The most effective things out there are documentary films like Fall of the Republic, Obama Deception, Invisible Empire, Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA.
[01:58:19.115 --> 01:58:20.897]  Get them all at InfoWars.com.
[01:58:21.297 --> 01:58:25.198]  Buy a bunch of blank DVDs, make copies, and say, you want to know why you're losing your job?
[01:58:25.198 --> 01:58:26.118]  I didn't even get to this!
[01:58:26.118 --> 01:58:32.040]  I didn't even get to failed banks may get pension fund backing as FDIC seeks cash Bloomberg!
[01:58:32.040 --> 01:58:37.042]  They say they're basically ordering the pension fund, private pension funds, to be given to the Federal Reserve!
[01:58:37.042 --> 01:58:42.843]  I mean, this is so incredible, ladies and gentlemen!
[01:58:42.843 --> 01:58:44.224]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:44.224 --> 01:58:47.465]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:52.310 --> 01:58:56.331]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:58:56.331 --> 01:58:59.572]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:58:59.572 --> 01:59:04.373]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:59:04.373 --> 01:59:10.755]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:59:10.755 --> 01:59:12.996]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:59:13.536 --> 01:59:13.836]  Tim Geithner?
[01:59:13.836 --> 01:59:14.336]  Bernanke?
[01:59:14.336 --> 01:59:14.696]  They're arsonists!
[01:59:14.696 --> 01:59:15.477]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:59:15.477 --> 01:59:17.798]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:59:32.443 --> 01:59:34.565]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:59:34.565 --> 01:59:39.708]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[01:59:39.708 --> 01:59:53.998]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:59:53.998 --> 01:59:56.380]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.380 --> 01:59:59.162]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.973 --> 02:00:10.797]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.797 --> 02:00:12.379]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.379 --> 02:00:13.960]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.960 --> 02:00:18.144]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.144 --> 02:00:22.188]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.821 --> 02:00:28.724]  I tell you, it is always great to hear his voice.
[02:00:28.724 --> 02:00:33.086]  And he's with us for the next hour and 15 minutes.
[02:00:33.086 --> 02:00:42.092]  An extended, in-depth interview with former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura, movie star, wrestler, mayor, best-selling author.
[02:00:42.092 --> 02:00:43.973]  You know, I bought 3,000 of his books.
[02:00:43.973 --> 02:00:45.034]  We've already sold 1,000 of them.
[02:00:45.034 --> 02:00:48.456]  And I got a call from the salesman from Skyhorse.
[02:00:48.456 --> 02:00:51.898]  They said, you better order some now, because we just sold out.
[02:00:52.879 --> 02:00:53.879]  They've sold out.
[02:00:53.879 --> 02:00:56.260]  Now, there's some in stores, but those are selling out quick.
[02:00:56.260 --> 02:00:58.020]  They're rushing to print more.
[02:00:58.020 --> 02:01:00.521]  We've got them at Infowars.com.
[02:01:00.521 --> 02:01:09.623]  And let me tell you, this is a scary book, because I've done the research, it's all accurate, and I've never seen somebody of Ventura's caliber go this far.
[02:01:09.623 --> 02:01:11.284]  We had Dick Russell on two days ago.
[02:01:11.824 --> 02:01:12.304]  Great to be here, Alex.
[02:01:38.118 --> 02:01:40.141]  Well, nothing really, you know.
[02:01:40.141 --> 02:01:52.018]  It was kind of a culture shock for me because when I lived down in Mexico, you know, I could walk some days three miles on the beach and never see another human and I'd jump on a plane and land right in the heart of Manhattan.
[02:01:53.135 --> 02:01:56.057]  That's a culture shock.
[02:01:56.057 --> 02:02:00.919]  Oh, I will tell you one fun story, Alex, before we get to the serious stuff.
[02:02:00.919 --> 02:02:08.603]  I didn't watch television from December 31st till this Sunday, and I did that on purpose just to flush my brain out a little.
[02:02:08.603 --> 02:02:10.724]  But, uh, I was playing golf.
[02:02:11.633 --> 02:02:11.873]  I don't
[02:02:32.937 --> 02:02:36.259]  Yeah, for those that don't know, surfers love to go to the tsunamis.
[02:02:36.259 --> 02:02:39.601]  Everybody else is running the other way, you're running towards it.
[02:02:59.372 --> 02:03:03.536]  Well hey, it's when in a lifetime do you get a chance to surf a tsunami?
[02:03:03.536 --> 02:03:06.599]  Well just as long as it's not too big.
[02:03:20.430 --> 02:03:24.931]  Well, you know, Laird Hamilton is the greatest big wave surfer in the world.
[02:03:24.931 --> 02:03:28.652]  And I read his book, and I'll tell you one thing that's interesting.
[02:03:28.652 --> 02:03:35.634]  Laird said that when he ever does these TV shows and radio, they always introduce him as fearless.
[02:03:35.634 --> 02:03:38.515]  And Laird said, that's the equivalent of calling me an idiot.
[02:03:39.661 --> 02:03:43.203]  Every big wave I ride, I experience fear.
[02:03:43.203 --> 02:03:48.926]  But he said, I'm a person who can take that fear and channel it into performance.
[02:03:48.926 --> 02:03:51.887]  And there are people that are capable of doing that.
[02:03:51.887 --> 02:03:57.830]  But I found it interesting when he said that, that calling me fearless is like calling me an idiot.
[02:03:57.830 --> 02:04:00.872]  Absolutely, it's fear that keeps us on our toes.
[02:04:00.872 --> 02:04:01.472]  Exactly.
[02:04:02.901 --> 02:04:04.442]  We're going to go to break, Governor.
[02:04:04.442 --> 02:04:13.811]  But again, I am so excited that this book is number four, and I'm sure it's going to hit number one by next week on Amazon and everywhere else.
[02:04:13.811 --> 02:04:16.693]  I want to encourage listeners to buy it at Infowars.com.
[02:04:16.693 --> 02:04:17.534]  We're discounting it.
[02:04:17.534 --> 02:04:19.415]  It's hardcover, $24.95 in bookstores, $19.95 at Infowars.com.
[02:04:22.578 --> 02:04:24.280]  And we also give you a free film.
[02:04:24.280 --> 02:04:27.163]  Loose Change Final Cut or Reflections and Warnings.
[02:04:27.163 --> 02:04:27.783]  Two films.
[02:04:27.783 --> 02:04:28.884]  One I produced.
[02:04:28.884 --> 02:04:29.905]  One I directed.
[02:04:29.905 --> 02:04:32.728]  You can get one of these videos free with the book.
[02:04:32.728 --> 02:04:34.009]  You can't beat that deal.
[02:04:34.009 --> 02:04:35.491]  Infowars.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:04:35.491 --> 02:04:36.452]  Jesse the Mind Ventura.
[02:04:43.177 --> 02:04:47.761]  I'm going to ask him when we get back, is he worried about the globalists coming after him?
[02:04:47.761 --> 02:04:48.402]  Is he worried?
[02:04:48.402 --> 02:04:55.749]  Because I was talking to his co-author Dick Russell about all the people he interviewed for the JFK assassination that got murdered.
[02:04:55.749 --> 02:04:57.411]  Jesse Ventura, we'll be right back.
[02:05:02.847 --> 02:05:06.808]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:06.808 --> 02:05:15.671]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:05:15.671 --> 02:05:20.292]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:05:20.292 --> 02:05:31.116]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:05:31.736 --> 02:05:41.258]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:41.258 --> 02:05:46.680]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:05:46.680 --> 02:05:54.181]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.

[02:06:00.865 --> 02:06:02.165]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:06:02.165 --> 02:06:07.747]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:06:07.747 --> 02:06:12.769]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:06:12.769 --> 02:06:18.351]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[02:06:18.351 --> 02:06:20.172]  So, our friends at Solutions from Science,
[02:06:20.452 --> 02:06:20.952]  We're good to go.

[02:06:45.023 --> 02:06:48.465]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:06:48.465 --> 02:06:50.207]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:07:00.988 --> 02:07:03.750]  Hi, Alex has been encouraging you to get food.

[02:07:09.755 --> 02:07:17.601]  Anyone placing food orders on the large volume production run scheduled for the week of March 22nd can get a lot of food for very little cost.
[02:07:18.021 --> 02:07:24.386]  For example, with each pre-production order of three seven-day responders, they'll ship a fourth week of food free.
[02:07:24.386 --> 02:07:26.547]  That's buy three, get one free.
[02:07:26.547 --> 02:07:29.469]  They'll take orders from now until March 22nd.
[02:07:29.469 --> 02:07:37.015]  The following week, they'll produce huge runs of the pre-ordered food, passing the savings to you in this buy three, get one free program.
[02:07:37.435 --> 02:07:40.698]  Folks, this is the best chance to stock up you'll ever see.
[02:07:40.698 --> 02:07:41.759]  Another example?
[02:07:41.759 --> 02:07:44.942]  Buy nine months worth of food and get three months free.
[02:07:44.942 --> 02:07:50.107]  You've got to go to efoodsdirect.com slash Alex for the food buy of a lifetime.
[02:07:50.107 --> 02:07:50.928]  Or call 800-409-5633.
[02:07:50.928 --> 02:07:51.969]  Go to efoodsdirect.com slash Alex or 800-409-5633.
[02:08:02.845 --> 02:08:05.508]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:08:05.508 --> 02:08:08.311]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:16.383 --> 02:08:19.507]  Let me tell you, Ventura is so recharged.
[02:08:19.507 --> 02:08:22.851]  Being with him in person, I've never met anybody that has as much energy.
[02:08:22.851 --> 02:08:26.535]  It's not a put-on, it's just a... just a dynamism.
[02:08:26.535 --> 02:08:31.681]  But, he was still overshadowing everything before he went back to Mexico for three months to recharge.
[02:08:31.681 --> 02:08:36.287]  I could tell he was a little more tired than normal, but he is definitely back.
[02:08:36.827 --> 02:08:39.709]  And blasting with both barrels full power.
[02:08:39.709 --> 02:08:42.411]  He just gave me some very exciting news.
[02:08:42.411 --> 02:08:47.434]  I heard about this a few weeks ago, but was told not to talk about it from some of the folks involved with the show.
[02:08:47.434 --> 02:09:02.883]  But Jesse can now tell you, because the emails, the Twitters coming in are asking me, is Jesse Ventura's top rated on TruTV, beat out all the news networks but Fox, out of the gates, that's unheard of, conspiracy theory, Jesse Ventura.
[02:09:02.883 --> 02:09:05.485]  Is your show coming back to television and when?
[02:09:06.065 --> 02:09:06.906]  Yes it is.
[02:09:06.906 --> 02:09:13.554]  They've, uh, TruTV with the grant, let's give them credit because what they're doing shows a lot of courage.
[02:09:13.554 --> 02:09:18.959]  Uh, TruTV has re-upped for at least eight and possibly ten more shows.
[02:09:18.959 --> 02:09:21.782]  We're starting to put things together now.
[02:09:21.782 --> 02:09:25.727]  We will probably actually ramp up and begin shooting around June.
[02:09:26.571 --> 02:09:28.372]  Man, that is exciting, Governor.
[02:09:28.372 --> 02:09:30.832]  Well, I'm kind of excited over it.
[02:09:30.832 --> 02:09:33.893]  My son Tyrell now will be a field producer.
[02:09:33.893 --> 02:09:38.734]  He's gotten a nice big boost in position because they like his work.
[02:09:38.734 --> 02:09:44.436]  And so, you know, things are going full bore as soon as June comes, probably.
[02:09:44.436 --> 02:09:47.977]  And a lot of people are emailing asking, will Mr. Jones be involved?
[02:09:48.484 --> 02:09:51.826]  Well, you know, Alex, you're such a fountain of information.
[02:09:51.826 --> 02:10:01.530]  I don't think that there's any way on eight to ten conspiracies that you wouldn't have some great knowledge or know where to send us places to get knowledge.
[02:10:01.530 --> 02:10:07.974]  So I'm certain that you'll have a role in the second season.
[02:10:07.974 --> 02:10:09.754]  Man, you're a sweetheart, Governor Ventura.
[02:10:11.641 --> 02:10:17.784]  Now, you were telling me off-air, you guys have got it, what, pared down to about 20, but they're talking about 8, 10, 12 episodes.
[02:10:17.784 --> 02:10:21.425]  Well, they're talking, they said 8 for sure and possibly 10.
[02:10:21.425 --> 02:10:22.146]  Possibly 10.
[02:10:22.146 --> 02:10:27.508]  Any sneak peeks on some of the things that are in the hopper being looked at right now?
[02:10:27.508 --> 02:10:38.093]  No, Alex, I won't go that far because I'd hate to see... See, a battle will happen, it always does, between what I want to do and what TruTV wants to do.
[02:10:38.093 --> 02:10:40.954]  But contrary to the Democrats and Republicans,
[02:10:41.714 --> 02:10:43.316]  Absolutely, certainly don't tip your hand.
[02:11:03.393 --> 02:11:08.219]  People asked me, they said, how can mainstream television put on a truly objective program?
[02:11:08.219 --> 02:11:18.913]  And I said, I know Governor Ventura well, he's a man of his word, he's gonna produce this truthfully and follow the facts wherever they lead, and then it basically just won't air if it...
[02:11:19.941 --> 02:11:24.365]  If he has to compromise and it came out and people were stunned.
[02:11:24.365 --> 02:11:25.807]  This is trailblazing.
[02:11:25.807 --> 02:11:30.632]  Nothing like this has ever been on national television.
[02:11:30.632 --> 02:11:33.654]  I mean, I want listeners to realize this was a true first.
[02:11:33.654 --> 02:11:39.160]  Governor Ventura, how were you able to get something done that no one before had ever done?
[02:11:39.660 --> 02:11:42.401]  Well, I guess you'd have to put that like this, Alex.
[02:11:42.401 --> 02:11:52.222]  How was I able to defeat the Democrats and Republicans and become the governor of Minnesota and only raise $300,000 to do it?
[02:11:52.222 --> 02:11:53.062]  Perseverance?
[02:11:53.062 --> 02:11:53.762]  Smarts?
[02:11:53.762 --> 02:11:54.403]  Will?
[02:11:54.403 --> 02:11:58.023]  It's just ideas and passion and that.
[02:11:58.023 --> 02:12:08.165]  Again, I can't really fully answer it, because like I said, when we first thought we could do this show, I told my crew, I had a gentleman's bet with them, and I said,
[02:12:09.065 --> 02:12:17.049]  We're going to do all these and we'll all get paid, but I said, I believe at the 11th hour they're going to pull the plug on this thing and it'll never see the light of day.
[02:12:17.049 --> 02:12:34.518]  Well, I'm happy to say I lost that bet because, as I said, TruTV showed great courage and they aired them all and they didn't edit them and they did nothing because we did them all out in California and sent them all to them and we got them ready to go and they got on board and did it.
[02:12:35.999 --> 02:12:36.701]  I think so.
[02:12:49.691 --> 02:13:08.468]  Royal flush here and and I talked to Braverman when you were back in Mexico hyping one of the last shows on air for those that don't know one of the fellows involved and he said Alex you wouldn't believe the big stars that are contacting us and I went through some of the names because I know some of them and he goes wow yeah that's that's some of them but he said
[02:13:09.485 --> 02:13:30.280]  He described it as, Hollywood wants to keep it in the left-right paradigm, Jesse Ventura is shattering that left-right paradigm, the media calls questioning anything the government does a conspiracy theory that's outside that left-right orthodoxy, and that there's a war inside Hollywood and the media, where most of the big names we know and see even in news, not just in entertainment,
[02:13:30.800 --> 02:13:31.361]  We're good to go.
[02:13:43.965 --> 02:13:57.270]  Like Steven Spielberg to keep it left right and and because as Hollywood goes so goes the rest of the world and now they just can't put this label on people that are questioning the official story and who have government documents.
[02:13:57.270 --> 02:14:04.153]  I mean every time you go on TV they say you're just a conspiracy theorist or you know you're making this up and you point out no I'm not.
[02:14:04.153 --> 02:14:06.934]  I'm going off things like Operation Northwoods.
[02:14:06.934 --> 02:14:08.295]  I mean here's Operation Northwoods.
[02:14:09.415 --> 02:14:10.816]  The actual document right here.
[02:14:10.816 --> 02:14:12.158]  We got ABC News, U.S.
[02:14:12.158 --> 02:14:15.380]  government plan to terrorize and stage fake terror attacks.
[02:14:15.380 --> 02:14:20.665]  What can you say about the huge paradigm shift that's happening and the type of feedback you're getting from Hollywood?
[02:14:21.255 --> 02:14:23.437]  Well, I haven't really been to Hollywood.
[02:14:23.437 --> 02:14:31.982]  As I said, Alex, I flew from Mexico straight to New York, and I'll go to Los Angeles Sunday, and I'll be there through Wednesday.
[02:14:31.982 --> 02:14:38.146]  So, you know, I'll probably get a better feel for it when I get out there, and I really wouldn't want to speculate.
[02:14:38.146 --> 02:14:40.668]  As I said, I haven't had any contact.
[02:14:40.668 --> 02:14:46.392]  Where I live in Mexico, I don't have a phone or any of that stuff, so I really haven't spoken to anybody.
[02:14:46.392 --> 02:14:51.075]  But, Alex, you want to hear another good one that's a little, you know, off the subject for a second?
[02:14:51.436 --> 02:14:51.616]  Sure.
[02:15:00.580 --> 02:15:05.322]  Dog the Bounty Hunter's got one out, and I don't care if Dog beats me or not.
[02:15:05.322 --> 02:15:06.362]  I kind of like Dog.
[02:15:06.362 --> 02:15:08.423]  He's kind of an interesting guy.
[02:15:08.423 --> 02:15:09.583]  But, here's the one.
[02:15:09.583 --> 02:15:14.625]  We're beating the crap out of Karl Rove's book.
[02:15:14.625 --> 02:15:16.865]  And that's the guy I want to beat.
[02:15:16.865 --> 02:15:19.266]  I want this book to beat Karl Rove.
[02:15:19.266 --> 02:15:27.129]  Because Karl Rove's book, I haven't read it yet, but a friend of mine read it, and he told me that the book is trying to rewrite history.
[02:15:27.933 --> 02:15:32.374]  Oh yeah, saying basically that Saddam had WMDs and things.
[02:15:32.374 --> 02:15:34.335]  You know, you said you'd like to waterboard Cheney.
[02:15:34.335 --> 02:15:36.816]  What about Rove?
[02:15:36.816 --> 02:15:39.796]  You know, I actually saw Rove when I did the Today Show.
[02:15:39.796 --> 02:15:44.178]  Matt Lauer introduced him right before my segment.
[02:15:44.178 --> 02:15:45.558]  I was standing there.
[02:15:45.558 --> 02:15:47.499]  I just stood back and kept watching him.
[02:15:47.499 --> 02:15:49.939]  But I will give Rove one bit of credit.
[02:15:49.939 --> 02:15:51.680]  He has lost a great deal of weight.
[02:15:54.096 --> 02:15:57.497]  Well, I guess that is credit for him, but he is such a wicked person.
[02:15:57.497 --> 02:15:59.238]  Well, he sure wasn't to me.
[02:15:59.238 --> 02:16:05.520]  He came almost running over to me to shake my hand, so I don't know what that was all about.
[02:16:05.520 --> 02:16:14.784]  Well, he knows you're a big political contender, but as Tyrell said, you want to do the TV show and some more books, but you're leaning towards riding off into the sunset?
[02:16:14.784 --> 02:16:15.724]  I hope that's not the case.
[02:16:16.337 --> 02:16:24.066]  Well, you know, I'll tell you what actually happened, and you can thank Dick Russell for this.
[02:16:24.066 --> 02:16:30.733]  In my last book, Don't Start the Revolution Without Me, you remember I wrote that last chapter as fiction?
[02:16:31.511 --> 02:16:31.971]  Yes.
[02:16:31.971 --> 02:16:35.313]  You know where I made the run for the president with Robert Kennedy Jr.
[02:16:35.313 --> 02:16:37.675]  and I get shot and all that stuff?
[02:16:37.675 --> 02:16:40.576]  Well, I was going to end it right there.
[02:16:40.576 --> 02:16:45.559]  I was going to die in the end of that book and I was never going to do anything public again.
[02:16:45.559 --> 02:16:47.900]  I was going to destroy Jesse Ventura.
[02:16:47.900 --> 02:16:59.527]  I created him and I was going to destroy him then and then go on and you can thank Dick Russell because he talked me out of it and he only put me in a coma so obviously I've came back from the coma.
[02:17:00.888 --> 02:17:01.489]  Oh, wait a minute.
[02:17:01.489 --> 02:17:04.631]  Are you starting to maybe think about 2012?
[02:17:04.631 --> 02:17:07.012]  Oh, no, no, no, no.
[02:17:07.012 --> 02:17:10.054]  I just mean it's still considered to be in the public.
[02:17:10.054 --> 02:17:15.917]  No, Alex, I have no desire at this time to run for public office at all.
[02:17:15.917 --> 02:17:20.880]  I think that in many ways I can be as much or more effective in what I'm doing right now.
[02:17:20.880 --> 02:17:21.220]  That's right.
[02:17:21.220 --> 02:17:28.124]  You can go off and cogitate kind of in the mountains like a prophet and then occasionally come back to the wicked city and enlighten us.
[02:17:28.504 --> 02:17:41.668]  Well, and then what's good about it, Alex, is I can come up here and stir everything up and all this stuff, and then I can run back to Mexico and leave you with all the collateral damage.
[02:17:41.668 --> 02:17:50.071]  Well, I mean, I probably shouldn't bring stuff up on air without asking you, but I don't want to give you more work to do, but may we ever see Jesse Ventura sitting in the Alex Jones broadcast seat for me?
[02:17:50.071 --> 02:17:50.851]  Well, it could be.
[02:17:50.851 --> 02:17:52.852]  You know, like I said, you need a vacation.
[02:17:54.366 --> 02:18:04.708]  You know, maybe if you want to take a vacation sometime, I won't promise anything, but if you want to take a vacation sometime, I might sit there, but the people left understand something.
[02:18:04.708 --> 02:18:08.108]  I don't have all the knowledge that you have.
[02:18:08.108 --> 02:18:09.209]  Oh, yes, you do.
[02:18:09.209 --> 02:18:10.089]  No, I don't.
[02:18:10.089 --> 02:18:11.809]  You have a lot of different knowledge I don't have.
[02:18:11.809 --> 02:18:13.089]  I have some knowledge you don't have.
[02:18:13.089 --> 02:18:16.290]  Well, okay, and together we'll make a whole, I guess.
[02:18:16.290 --> 02:18:18.370]  Exactly.
[02:18:18.370 --> 02:18:20.110]  Are you kidding, Jesse?
[02:18:20.110 --> 02:18:20.991]  That's such a great idea.
[02:18:20.991 --> 02:18:21.571]  I hope you do it.
[02:18:23.630 --> 02:18:25.732]  So much is going on, so much is happening.
[02:18:25.732 --> 02:18:29.755]  I put the call out again for people to buy the book, not just to beat Karl Rove.
[02:18:29.755 --> 02:18:35.439]  Your show being number one on TruTV, one of the top shows on cable for a new show is unheard of.
[02:18:35.439 --> 02:18:38.241]  The fact that your books are bestsellers, that this one's a bestseller.
[02:18:38.721 --> 02:18:45.183]  I mean, this is really the alternative media and alternative views starting to supplant the mainstream media.
[02:18:45.183 --> 02:18:50.184]  The new numbers came out last month that now the alternative media together is bigger than the mainstream media.
[02:18:50.184 --> 02:18:56.166]  So I think we see these dinosaurs really starting to realize that their time has ended.
[02:18:56.166 --> 02:19:02.968]  Well, I'm not sure about that, or maybe it's the fact that even better, maybe this country is starting to wake up.
[02:19:03.724 --> 02:19:04.405]  Absolutely.
[02:19:04.405 --> 02:19:18.816]  You know, maybe this country is starting to, people are starting to get finally frustrated enough with the media that we have, and the status quo that's going on, and has been for years and years, that hopefully we're accomplishing that.
[02:19:18.816 --> 02:19:29.504]  Because, you know, one thing, I don't agree with them totally, because of some of the people in it, but I actually like the idea that the Tea Party's out there stirring it up too.
[02:19:31.172 --> 02:19:32.112]  Absolutely.
[02:19:32.112 --> 02:19:32.732]  We're going to break.
[02:19:32.732 --> 02:19:36.373]  I want to come back and ask you that big question that Dick Russell brought up quite a bit.
[02:19:36.373 --> 02:19:41.314]  All the people he knows that have been killed who exposed this stuff and why you made the decision to be so bold.
[02:19:41.314 --> 02:19:46.356]  Because, folks, when I say this book is hardcore, we'll go over some of the chapters later.
[02:19:46.356 --> 02:19:48.116]  We'll also open the phones up.
[02:19:48.116 --> 02:19:53.657]  And I've got a big list of handwritten questions I wrote up that I want to ask Ventura all over the map.
[02:19:53.657 --> 02:19:59.959]  Like, the word is he's already shot a video film for the Wachowski brothers.
[02:20:01.360 --> 02:20:04.561]  If you suffer from poor sleep, you've gotta try MyPillow!

[02:21:02.506 --> 02:21:06.531]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:21:06.531 --> 02:21:09.775]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:21:09.775 --> 02:21:14.581]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:21:14.581 --> 02:21:18.426]  We have tremendous influence on our president and Congress.
[02:21:19.082 --> 02:21:20.942]  And they really are calling the shots.
[02:21:20.942 --> 02:21:26.504]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us, as American citizens, to pay attention.
[02:21:26.504 --> 02:21:29.485]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[02:21:29.485 --> 02:21:36.266]  A criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:21:36.266 --> 02:21:38.607]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:21:38.607 --> 02:21:40.187]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:21:40.187 --> 02:21:42.648]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:21:42.648 --> 02:21:44.769]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:21:44.769 --> 02:21:46.309]  And right now in Washington, D.C.,
[02:21:47.009 --> 02:21:49.911]  We have seen a fall of the Republic.

[02:22:00.982 --> 02:22:11.010]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[02:22:11.010 --> 02:22:17.455]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[02:22:17.455 --> 02:22:26.302]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[02:22:26.682 --> 02:22:35.870]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[02:22:35.870 --> 02:22:40.734]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[02:22:40.734 --> 02:22:42.275]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[02:24:06.302 --> 02:24:08.303]  Jesse Ventura needs no introduction.
[02:24:08.303 --> 02:24:09.144]  He is our guest.
[02:24:09.144 --> 02:24:10.405]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:24:12.449 --> 02:24:17.271]  Governor, we've seen massive demonization and censorship of 9-11 Truth.
[02:24:17.271 --> 02:24:19.632]  I've never seen such a blitz.
[02:24:19.632 --> 02:24:23.993]  But now we have 1,100 architects and engineers going public, saying inside job.
[02:24:23.993 --> 02:24:25.174]  The evidence is coming out.
[02:24:25.174 --> 02:24:28.455]  It looks like we've got the establishment on the defense right now.
[02:24:28.871 --> 02:24:35.293]  Well, you know, Alex, that's a great lead-in because, you know, usually we're on the defense.
[02:24:35.293 --> 02:24:37.553]  And I think it's time we go on the offense.
[02:24:37.553 --> 02:24:47.296]  What I'd like to do, as you know, the Huffington Post censored... Arianna Huffington had been on my case for about two years to contribute to the Huffington Post.
[02:24:47.976 --> 02:24:53.738]  So I did my first article, and then I followed it up with my second one, and of course they censored it.
[02:24:53.738 --> 02:24:56.299]  They had it on for an hour and then pulled it.
[02:24:56.299 --> 02:25:08.324]  What I'd like to appeal, to go on the offense, to all your listeners, email the Huffington Post and demand to know why Jesse Ventura was censored on the Huffington Post.
[02:25:08.324 --> 02:25:11.665]  And I really would like to appeal to all your listeners to do that.
[02:25:11.665 --> 02:25:13.806]  Let's go on the offense and stick it to them.
[02:25:14.790 --> 02:25:15.871]  Absolutely.
[02:25:15.871 --> 02:25:21.194]  The Huffington Post requested that I write an article for them about a year ago.
[02:25:21.194 --> 02:25:24.996]  We sent it to them, they said make changes, and I just said forget it.
[02:25:24.996 --> 02:25:37.904]  You asked for this, and you were nice enough to write two articles for them, and they took the first one about government drug dealing, but posted your 9-11 article about Building 7 for about an hour, and then pulled it.
[02:25:37.904 --> 02:25:39.265]  It's just amazing.
[02:25:39.815 --> 02:25:44.097]  Yeah, and so, you know, again, I know what your listeners are like out there.
[02:25:44.097 --> 02:25:46.359]  They're very loyal to you, Alex.
[02:25:46.359 --> 02:25:51.622]  And so, send those emails to the Huffington Post and send a barrage of them.
[02:25:51.622 --> 02:25:58.966]  Imagine if they got 100,000 or more emails demanding to know why Jesse Ventura was censored from the Huffington Post.
[02:25:59.346 --> 02:26:04.027]  Well, I think more than that, we need to vote by buying the book and not let them censor it.
[02:26:04.027 --> 02:26:12.870]  And we also, if you want to get serious, go after their sponsors because they might just like the traffic from emails overall and think they're getting attention out of it.
[02:26:12.870 --> 02:26:17.911]  But, I mean, that's a good idea, but there's got to be some other way to punish these people.
[02:26:17.911 --> 02:26:19.612]  How about folks go get the article
[02:26:20.052 --> 02:26:22.233]  That we reposted at InfoWars.com.
[02:26:22.233 --> 02:26:23.993]  In fact, print it for me so I have the title.
[02:26:23.993 --> 02:26:25.094]  What was the title, Jesse?
[02:26:25.094 --> 02:26:29.815]  People can find it all over the web, and then that way we can email it out to all the media.
[02:26:29.815 --> 02:26:34.897]  I think that's the best way to really protest this, is to make sure that's in everybody's email inbox.
[02:26:35.297 --> 02:26:49.085]  Well, on the top it says, Huffington Post, Jesse Ventura, Article 2, American, and in parenthesis, American Conspiracies, and the title is, What Really Happened on September the 11th.
[02:26:49.085 --> 02:26:53.147]  What really happened on- Huffington Title, What Really Happened on September 11th.
[02:26:53.147 --> 02:27:00.972]  What Really Happened on September 11th, Jesse Ventura, search that, find the article that was censored, it's all over the web now, and get it out to even more people.
[02:27:00.972 --> 02:27:01.832]  But you know what, Jesse?
[02:27:01.832 --> 02:27:04.374]  I think them censoring it only backfired on them.
[02:27:04.727 --> 02:27:06.149]  Well, I'm hoping so.
[02:27:06.149 --> 02:27:07.730]  We can make it backfire on him.
[02:27:07.730 --> 02:27:08.892]  I think so too.
[02:27:08.892 --> 02:27:13.076]  And I'll tell you this, I won't ever write for him again.
[02:27:13.076 --> 02:27:13.677]  Absolutely.
[02:27:13.677 --> 02:27:16.140]  I mean, they come to you and then they censor it.
[02:27:17.105 --> 02:27:18.226]  Yes, I'll say on the record, absolutely.
[02:27:18.226 --> 02:27:20.027]  Jesse Ventura will never, ever commit suicide.
[02:27:47.119 --> 02:27:48.039]  And I second that.
[02:27:48.039 --> 02:27:50.400]  I will never commit suicide.
[02:27:50.400 --> 02:27:51.080]  I had the D.C.
[02:27:51.080 --> 02:28:12.924]  Madam on air say that three months before they killed her, and I had been talking for a month before they killed Gary Webb, the Pulitzer Prize winner on CIA drug dealing, that they'd been breaking into his house, and he was getting ready to come on the show when his new book came out, and they shotgunned him twice in the head, and the police said, Jesse, it's very normal to shoot yourself twice in the head.
[02:28:12.924 --> 02:28:16.245]  As a trained Navy SEAL, is that poppycock?
[02:28:21.805 --> 02:28:27.110]  Uh, that's about the only answer I could give you, Alex, is to burst out laughing.
[02:28:27.110 --> 02:28:28.251]  It is ridiculous.
[02:28:28.251 --> 02:28:29.272]  Come on, man.
[02:28:29.272 --> 02:28:37.139]  The only way you could shoot yourself twice in the head is if you missed with the first one.
[02:28:37.139 --> 02:28:40.762]  I know, it's incredible.
[02:28:40.762 --> 02:28:42.203]  They just think we're so stupid.
[02:28:42.978 --> 02:28:48.662]  Well, you know, Alex, that's how they survive, is an apathetic public.
[02:28:48.662 --> 02:28:56.466]  You know, a public that doesn't want to be involved, a public that doesn't want to pay attention, and that's what's wrong with so much of America today.
[02:28:56.466 --> 02:29:07.453]  Everybody looks around in their little tiny world, and they think, well, everywhere I see, everything is good, and as long as it doesn't upset what I can see, I'm not going to get involved.
[02:29:07.453 --> 02:29:10.395]  And the thing is, in our country, you should get involved.
[02:29:11.713 --> 02:29:14.038]  If you don't get involved, a bunch of crooks will take over.
[02:29:14.038 --> 02:29:14.799]  That's right.
[02:29:14.799 --> 02:29:19.889]  You know, if you don't hold government's feet to the fire, you will get bad government.
[02:29:20.905 --> 02:29:21.645]  We're going to break.
[02:29:21.645 --> 02:29:23.846]  Long segment coming up with Governor Jesse Ventura.
[02:29:23.846 --> 02:29:26.367]  He's with us 15 minutes or so into the next hour.
[02:29:26.367 --> 02:29:29.949]  Precious time with just an incredible personality.
[02:29:29.949 --> 02:29:32.770]  Somebody for liberty and freedom.
[02:29:32.770 --> 02:29:36.191]  Somebody out there standing up for all of our rights.
[02:29:36.191 --> 02:29:37.452]  Governor Jesse Ventura.
[02:29:37.452 --> 02:29:39.132]  Here's the censored article.
[02:29:39.132 --> 02:29:47.216]  Huffington Post sends Ventura article to the memory hole up at InfoWars.com with his article underneath it.
[02:29:47.216 --> 02:29:47.556]  Get it.

[02:29:54.750 --> 02:30:01.156]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:30:06.461 --> 02:30:09.224]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[02:30:09.224 --> 02:30:14.549]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.

[02:31:02.321 --> 02:31:07.903]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:31:07.903 --> 02:31:12.904]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:31:12.904 --> 02:31:18.485]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.

[02:33:14.394 --> 02:33:19.700]  We are back live with Governor Jesse Ventura, multi-time best-selling author.
[02:33:19.700 --> 02:33:22.664]  His book, number four on Amazon, available at InfoWars.com.
[02:33:22.664 --> 02:33:26.248]  We're gonna go through the book and talk about some of the chapters here in a moment.
[02:33:26.248 --> 02:33:28.070]  I want to get into some other questions first.
[02:33:28.070 --> 02:33:33.557]  Here's the National Post's big Canadian paper today, flu shots futile, government study fines.
[02:33:34.017 --> 02:33:37.740]  That it didn't even protect people and the shot was dangerous.
[02:33:37.740 --> 02:33:42.503]  This is directly for the document cam folks watching at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:33:42.503 --> 02:33:43.564]  FDA, U.S.
[02:33:43.564 --> 02:33:47.286]  Food and Drug Administration recall FDA.gov.
[02:33:47.286 --> 02:33:48.287]  See that folks?
[02:33:48.287 --> 02:33:50.868]  They're recalling all the vaccine.
[02:33:50.868 --> 02:33:58.894]  A month ago we had the head of the EU 47 nation member panel on, a doctor, saying it was dangerous and bad and hurting people.
[02:33:58.894 --> 02:34:00.595]  Governor, you've been proven right again.
[02:34:00.595 --> 02:34:03.537]  Why did you instinctually come out against the flu shot?
[02:34:04.897 --> 02:34:06.278]  Absolutely.
[02:34:33.706 --> 02:34:39.172]  I want to get into the book in a moment, but I've got a lot of questions that I wanted to raise to you.
[02:34:41.604 --> 02:34:46.648]  Getting back to the media attacks, how they're bouncing off of you.
[02:34:46.648 --> 02:34:51.812]  I mean, you're being attacked by Fox News, radio, other TV networks.
[02:34:51.812 --> 02:35:01.078]  You go on these shows, they try to criticize you, and then you just completely take the air out of their sails, laying out the facts.
[02:35:01.078 --> 02:35:05.702]  It's almost like we're fighting paper tigers, and we're beginning to see that these people aren't invincible.
[02:35:06.380 --> 02:35:17.410]  Well, and the thing is, most of them have never done any research other than soundbite television and what they send to them over a teleprompter, you know, to read a couple soundbites.
[02:35:17.410 --> 02:35:19.792]  Like, did you happen to catch me on the view?
[02:35:19.792 --> 02:35:22.875]  It was incredibly powerful.
[02:35:22.875 --> 02:35:25.237]  Well, the thing was, I was amazed.
[02:35:25.237 --> 02:35:27.860]  Barbara Walters was my main adversary.
[02:35:29.568 --> 02:35:39.150]  And I found that funny because she says to me, Governor, you're telling me they would intentionally kill 3,000 people, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[02:35:39.150 --> 02:35:43.391]  And I said, Barbara, I'll give you another example.
[02:35:43.391 --> 02:35:46.252]  The Gulf of Conkin incident never happened.
[02:35:46.252 --> 02:35:51.933]  They killed 58,000 of my generation in Vietnam and who knows, maybe a million Vietnamese.
[02:35:56.730 --> 02:35:59.232]  Bill O'Reilly called you a pinhead last night.
[02:35:59.232 --> 02:36:04.016]  I mean, this is a guy with his past that I don't think really has any credibility.
[02:36:04.016 --> 02:36:04.897]  What did he call me?
[02:36:04.897 --> 02:36:07.219]  This is the second time now he's called me a pinhead.
[02:36:07.219 --> 02:36:10.042]  What did he call me a pinhead for?
[02:36:10.042 --> 02:36:13.845]  He played the clip from The View and basically called you a pinhead.
[02:36:14.531 --> 02:36:27.116]  Well, you know, I ran into O'Reilly at Fox and, boy, he sure doesn't do that to me when he's face-to-face with me because Bill O'Reilly's afraid to have me on his show because I don't callous to him.
[02:36:27.116 --> 02:36:31.338]  And I'll tell you, I'll give your listeners a good lie from Bill O'Reilly.
[02:36:32.461 --> 02:36:35.183]  He had Ted Turner on once.
[02:36:35.183 --> 02:36:40.648]  And I don't know, Ted looked like he was really out of it when he was on there because he didn't seem sharp.
[02:36:40.648 --> 02:36:49.335]  And O'Reilly made the statement that the killing fields in Cambodia were caused because we left Vietnam too soon.
[02:36:50.903 --> 02:36:55.168]  The first thing is we weren't at war technically in Cambodia or Laos.
[02:36:55.168 --> 02:36:57.111]  We were at war in Vietnam.
[02:36:57.111 --> 02:37:05.600]  And the killing fields were caused because Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger secretly carpet bombed the country into the Stone Age.
[02:37:06.281 --> 02:37:11.143]  That's how come the Camille Rouge was able to come down and do that ethnic cleansing.
[02:37:11.143 --> 02:37:20.666]  So you've got Bill O'Reilly all the time rewriting history, and I confronted him with that in the Fox lobby, and he wouldn't say anything.
[02:37:20.666 --> 02:37:24.987]  And I said, O'Reilly, I first said to him, when were you in Vietnam?
[02:37:26.295 --> 02:37:29.678]  Well, Zbigniew Brzezinski, who was running that, as you know,
[02:37:44.595 --> 02:37:44.935]  Yeah.
[02:37:44.935 --> 02:37:49.158]  You know, on that note, on that thought, have you read the book by Colonel Fletcher Crowdy?
[02:38:12.819 --> 02:38:13.840]  Yes, I have.
[02:38:13.840 --> 02:38:30.991]  Well, isn't that interesting when he talks about what happened at the end of World War II with that meeting that took place between Chiang Kai-shek, Stalin, Churchill, and Roosevelt, where they literally laid out what was going to happen to wars from that point on.
[02:38:30.991 --> 02:38:35.615]  They said all wars after World War II would be fought in third world countries.
[02:38:36.295 --> 02:38:42.641]  They would be fought with the military having no direct objective to achieve victory in the war.
[02:38:42.641 --> 02:38:47.625]  Now isn't that exactly what's happened since World War II with every war since?
[02:38:47.625 --> 02:38:58.274]  Sure, it's these phantom menace covert wars just meant to destabilize the third world so they can't ever industrially develop to threaten the West and that's actually in the British Royal Commission plan 1949.
[02:39:00.754 --> 02:39:08.029]  Yeah, and you know, it's just amazing to read about Prouty's book and everything he said when you look at history has come to pass.
[02:39:09.506 --> 02:39:13.968]  Absolutely, and he clearly put out the evidence that the military-industrial complex killed Kennedy.
[02:39:13.968 --> 02:39:15.128]  I mean, that's another example.
[02:39:15.128 --> 02:39:24.611]  They can laugh at you and I and call us conspiracy theorists when we have all the facts, but over 90% of Americans now, in major polls, believe the government's lying about Kennedy.
[02:39:24.611 --> 02:39:26.392]  So, again... No, I don't believe that.
[02:39:26.392 --> 02:39:27.152]  I saw that one.
[02:39:27.152 --> 02:39:35.175]  I think it was a CBS Supper Room by the poll, where people said, it's now a majority of the people that don't believe the government's told us the truth about 9-11.
[02:39:36.255 --> 02:39:37.456]  Exactly.
[02:39:37.456 --> 02:39:46.684]  I saw an Angus and Reed New York Times poll four years ago in 2006 where 84% want a new investigation and believe they're being lied to.
[02:39:46.684 --> 02:39:48.566]  So 84% of us are kooks, 84% of us are bad.
[02:39:48.566 --> 02:39:48.766]  Look,
[02:39:51.889 --> 02:39:53.570]  You did an episode on mind control.
[02:39:53.570 --> 02:39:54.590]  It's been declassified.
[02:39:54.590 --> 02:39:55.710]  They do have these candidates.
[02:39:55.710 --> 02:40:01.352]  They're always in psychiatric care and they always disappear for a few weeks or a few months.
[02:40:01.352 --> 02:40:15.856]  This Bedell guy has all the earmarks and the reason I predicted in the last three months that they were going to have 9-11 truthers stage some type of terror attack is there was no history of 9-11 truthers ever being violent or doing anything wrong.
[02:40:15.856 --> 02:40:19.617]  You have the majority of the public waking up to this and I saw Glenn Beck
[02:40:20.546 --> 02:40:29.412]  Bill O'Reilly, Chris Matthews, and others with a talking point the last three months saying 9-11 truth, Argonne Estates, terror attacks, mark my words.
[02:40:29.412 --> 02:40:37.837]  Now, how would they out of the blue just say this if they weren't prepping people and then you have Bedell and the whole thing is very suspicious.
[02:40:37.837 --> 02:40:42.560]  His parents warned him, he was under psychiatric care, he disappeared for months.
[02:40:42.560 --> 02:40:45.582]  Governor, your take on what happened with the Pentagon shooting?
[02:40:45.982 --> 02:40:49.585]  Well, yeah, that's exactly it.
[02:40:49.585 --> 02:40:57.492]  I thought I was going crazy because when that happened, my first reaction was, oh my god, a Manchurian candidate.
[02:40:57.492 --> 02:41:02.557]  And then I had to stop myself and go, I must be getting in too deep into this stuff.
[02:41:02.557 --> 02:41:06.660]  But lo and behold, I probably am not.
[02:41:06.660 --> 02:41:09.643]  You know, Alex, I've got to ask you a question here.
[02:41:11.121 --> 02:41:21.449]  Sometimes, this stuff gets so overwhelming to me that I really, and I gotta tell you honestly, there's certain times I start to question myself on this.
[02:41:21.449 --> 02:41:25.132]  How do you stay away from falling into that syndrome?
[02:41:25.132 --> 02:41:34.460]  Well, what you do is, you just look at the evidence, you analyze it, and if it isn't a staged event, the evidence will come out to that.
[02:41:34.460 --> 02:41:36.621]  If it is a staged event, you will see the earmarks.
[02:41:36.621 --> 02:41:37.402]  I mean, here's an example.
[02:41:38.339 --> 02:41:51.296]  Christmas Day, we'd forgotten eggs, I was driving around looking for a place that was open, my wife sent me out to get eggs, and I'm listening to the radio, and they announced there's been an underwear bombing on a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit.
[02:41:51.296 --> 02:41:52.938]  I go in, buy the eggs, come back out,
[02:41:53.519 --> 02:42:08.553]  And they're already got shirt off on Fox News Radio, who by the way makes a bunch of money off of it, saying don't worry, we just decided to put in naked body scanners, though I knew he'd ordered them a year before when he'd still been in office, the head of Homeland Security.
[02:42:09.373 --> 02:42:28.509]  And then immediately, several witnesses, Kurt Haskell and others, a lawyer, said a sharp-dressed man led the underwear bomber in Amsterdam up, threw the body scanners, he didn't have to show ID, he didn't have to show passport, argued with him, basically had a security clearance, got him on the plane without ID.
[02:42:28.509 --> 02:42:34.274]  So then I said, this is a weekend to it, I had Haskell on, I said, okay, you ought to interview him for the show, it's amazing.
[02:42:34.274 --> 02:42:35.575]  His wife saw it, other witnesses.
[02:42:36.155 --> 02:42:40.416]  Then the FBI showed up and basically threatened him, called him a liar in the media.
[02:42:40.416 --> 02:42:42.937]  Then other witnesses came out about the sharp-dressed man.
[02:42:42.937 --> 02:42:51.540]  Then Haskell said once they were put into the customs, the dog ran over and alerted to this other man, who previously it looked like had been with the bomber.
[02:42:52.762 --> 02:42:54.122]  And his bag had a bomb.
[02:42:54.122 --> 02:42:55.463]  They said, get out, there's a bomb.
[02:42:55.463 --> 02:42:56.743]  They arrested the guy.
[02:42:56.743 --> 02:42:59.004]  The FBI lied and said we arrested no one.
[02:42:59.004 --> 02:43:02.865]  Then a month later, they had to admit, we did arrest somebody.
[02:43:02.865 --> 02:43:04.465]  It's national security.
[02:43:04.465 --> 02:43:06.606]  And here's the Detroit News.
[02:43:06.606 --> 02:43:13.447]  Undersecretary of the State Department, Kennedy, Patrick F. Kennedy, said that an unnamed U.S.
[02:43:13.447 --> 02:43:20.189]  intelligence agency, this is on screen right now, true, a terror suspect kept visa to avoid tipping off larger investigation.
[02:43:20.809 --> 02:43:26.951]  And then when you read it, it says they were ordered to let him get on the plane and waive his visa.
[02:43:26.951 --> 02:43:28.712]  So, boom!
[02:43:28.712 --> 02:43:30.992]  Same thing with the Ford Hood shooter.
[02:43:30.992 --> 02:43:34.113]  They wanted to bust him, they were ordered for two years to leave him alone.
[02:43:34.113 --> 02:43:36.734]  Same thing with all of these events.
[02:43:36.734 --> 02:43:43.016]  So, once you know how they do it, and once you see them really promote something and push it,
[02:43:43.894 --> 02:43:44.634]  Okay.
[02:43:44.634 --> 02:43:45.815]  Well, that clears it up a little bit.
[02:44:00.362 --> 02:44:01.503]  How do you find all this stuff, Alex?
[02:44:27.850 --> 02:44:31.771]  Well, I've become completely obsessed and addicted to researching it.
[02:44:31.771 --> 02:44:37.713]  And, you know, I saw Springman, the head of the embassy, in the Toronto Star the month after 9-11.
[02:44:37.713 --> 02:44:38.433]  I interviewed him then.
[02:44:38.433 --> 02:44:40.714]  I've interviewed him many other times since then.
[02:44:40.714 --> 02:44:44.575]  I had him on a month ago and he said clearly the underwear bomber is the same deal.
[02:44:44.575 --> 02:44:46.575]  And he was the head of the embassy.
[02:44:46.575 --> 02:44:48.436]  Wow.
[02:44:48.436 --> 02:44:49.316]  Interesting stuff.
[02:44:49.864 --> 02:44:52.346]  Well, but you know how criminals work, though.
[02:44:52.346 --> 02:45:00.534]  They do things in a pathological way, meaning over and over again, so it's... Well, and the other thing is, too, if it works one time, it'll work again.
[02:45:01.562 --> 02:45:02.202]  Exactly.
[02:45:02.202 --> 02:45:04.004]  I mean, take Northwoods.
[02:45:04.004 --> 02:45:07.986]  Kennedy says no in 63, but then what do they do a year later at Tonkin?
[02:45:07.986 --> 02:45:10.748]  What do they do a few years later in 67 with the Liberty?
[02:45:10.748 --> 02:45:12.829]  I mean, they do the same thing over and over again.
[02:45:12.829 --> 02:45:17.652]  What is Northwoods, right here in my hand, folks, what does Operation Northwoods say they'll do?
[02:45:17.652 --> 02:45:21.955]  They'll bomb D.C., bomb Miami, graze troops at U.S.
[02:45:21.955 --> 02:45:25.217]  bases, wound them, grazing troops!
[02:45:25.217 --> 02:45:26.378]  What did we see at the Pentagon?
[02:45:31.243 --> 02:45:32.124]  Exactly what you said.
[02:45:32.124 --> 02:45:36.829]  Yeah, well then I loved that thing in 92 when they were part of that think tank.
[02:45:50.854 --> 02:46:06.067]  You know, where they did the submarine experiment or whatever, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, Cheney, the whole thing, and the question was, how do we keep the United States the sole superpower now with the fall of the Soviet Union?
[02:46:06.067 --> 02:46:17.697]  And they go through this litany of everything, and then in the end, it's got the summary, to implement everything we've recommended will take many, many, many years, unless a Pearl Harbor type of event were to occur.
[02:46:18.874 --> 02:46:22.341]  And they said 3,000 dead, like Pearl Harbor.
[02:46:22.341 --> 02:46:23.904]  What happened on 9-11?
[02:46:23.904 --> 02:46:25.187]  Exactly.
[02:46:25.187 --> 02:46:27.511]  Oh.
[02:46:27.511 --> 02:46:28.653]  It's incredible.
[02:46:28.653 --> 02:46:29.695]  But see, that's the problem.
[02:46:29.695 --> 02:46:30.838]  You hit on something key here.
[02:46:32.452 --> 02:46:44.415]  Most of the so-called conspiracy theorists do just say everything's a conspiracy without evidence, and so I'm a conspiracy, you're a conspiracy, Ron Paul's a conspiracy, with no evidence, ignoring the fruit of what we do.
[02:46:44.415 --> 02:46:46.375]  But that's not really the public's fault.
[02:46:46.375 --> 02:46:53.397]  If the government has been caught lying more than they tell the truth, and there's a total loss of confidence, then there's just going to be a loss of confidence in everything.
[02:46:53.397 --> 02:46:54.177]  What do we do about that?
[02:46:54.577 --> 02:46:56.379]  You know how I counter that, Alex?
[02:46:56.379 --> 02:46:57.700]  I got that again today.
[02:46:57.700 --> 02:47:00.762]  Where they said, are you a conspiracy theorist?
[02:47:00.762 --> 02:47:04.165]  And I looked at who, uh, Alan Combs asked me that.
[02:47:04.165 --> 02:47:08.989]  And I looked back at him and said, well, Alan, the government's a conspiracy theorist, too.
[02:47:08.989 --> 02:47:11.831]  They've never proved anything.
[02:47:11.831 --> 02:47:15.594]  I said, look at all the murders that took place in the 60s and early 70s.
[02:47:15.594 --> 02:47:17.476]  All those assassinations.
[02:47:17.476 --> 02:47:21.619]  Martin Luther King, uh, you know, Bobby Kennedy, Jack Kennedy.
[02:47:21.619 --> 02:47:23.281]  There was never a trial
[02:47:24.207 --> 02:47:26.188]  For any of these guys.
[02:47:26.188 --> 02:47:32.052]  Notice how there's never a trial for any of these assassins that happen.
[02:47:32.052 --> 02:47:39.237]  Well, we know under COINTELPRO they got declassified in 77 that the FBI would stage events, stage crimes, and blame it on people.
[02:47:39.237 --> 02:47:41.298]  We know Obama's regulations are.
[02:47:41.298 --> 02:47:47.823]  Cass Sunstein wrote a big policy paper saying infiltrate 9-11 Truth and commit acts of violence so we can put them in jail.
[02:47:48.507 --> 02:48:02.700]  Yeah, I couldn't believe when I read that about that guy from Harvard that wrote that paper saying that the 9-11 truthers and all this stuff that they should be put under surveillance and all this other stuff.
[02:48:02.700 --> 02:48:03.680]  Why?
[02:48:03.680 --> 02:48:07.744]  Because we question our government?
[02:48:07.744 --> 02:48:15.451]  I have to sit and think that all the founding fathers of this country have got to be turning over in their graves right now.
[02:48:16.656 --> 02:48:17.036]  They are.
[02:48:17.036 --> 02:48:19.238]  We're going to skip this break coming up with Jesse Ventura.
[02:48:19.238 --> 02:48:21.660]  He'll be with us into the next hour.
[02:48:21.660 --> 02:48:33.710]  I want to start getting into the book here in just a moment, chapter by chapter, because believe me, folks, when I tell you you need to get this book, when I was sent an advance copy, I didn't carry Ventura's last book, because when I did call to get it, it was sold out.
[02:48:33.710 --> 02:48:36.252]  I got involved early because I want people to read this.
[02:48:36.252 --> 02:48:37.594]  I mean, this is just
[02:48:38.374 --> 02:48:39.535]  Well, we kind of did that with heart.
[02:49:04.144 --> 02:49:05.725]  And that's where I'm going.
[02:49:05.725 --> 02:49:19.431]  With the Chile earthquake and with the, and this is even on CNN, and with the Haiti earthquake, they reported the sky had like an aurora borealis even during the day in the minutes before the earthquake.
[02:49:19.431 --> 02:49:26.794]  And I'm not saying these were staged, but if the government admits they have these systems, I mean, do we at least investigate it?
[02:49:27.662 --> 02:49:28.963]  Yeah, it's very interesting.
[02:49:28.963 --> 02:49:34.686]  They did that, it was the same thing in Indonesia, too, and they had the huge tsunami there.
[02:49:34.686 --> 02:49:50.135]  There was no indication of it, there was no earthquake before it, and I remember when I was doing my show, of course, Alex, not you, but Alex on the show, who's always the cynic, he said to me, Governor, are you trying to say that they would intentionally kill all these people?
[02:49:51.015 --> 02:49:52.317]  For no reason.
[02:49:52.317 --> 02:49:58.403]  And I said, Alex, I'm not saying that, but I'm saying they could just be testing this thing out.
[02:49:58.403 --> 02:50:01.265]  And maybe when they test it out, this is the result.
[02:50:01.265 --> 02:50:01.906]  What do you think?
[02:50:01.906 --> 02:50:03.708]  They're going to come back then and say, oops.
[02:50:05.350 --> 02:50:06.251]  Exactly.
[02:50:06.251 --> 02:50:23.243]  Some mathematicians, we posted this on InfoWars and Prison Planet a few weeks ago, have looked at the frequency of mega-earthquakes, these big earthquakes, 8 and above, and it's mathematically getting very suspicious that they keep hitting right in population centers.
[02:50:23.243 --> 02:50:25.105]  Yeah, that is pretty interesting.
[02:50:26.707 --> 02:50:39.026]  But then again, of course, I'm playing the devil's advocate, Alex, not necessarily big, but, you know, we've always had earthquakes, even before we had the technology, so it may not be fair to attribute every earthquake to them.
[02:50:39.654 --> 02:50:41.035]  Oh, no, I totally agree with you.
[02:50:41.035 --> 02:50:48.578]  I mean, I think these are probably just natural, but if the government admits they have this, then you've got to start looking into it.
[02:50:48.578 --> 02:50:50.038]  I mean, we are in the 21st century.
[02:50:50.038 --> 02:51:04.944]  And you know what's interesting about it, too, was that treaty that everybody signed years ago saying that they would not use if anyone developed the capability to control the weather, that it could not be used in a situation of war and all that.
[02:51:04.944 --> 02:51:07.245]  But I suppose they view it as, well, we're not at war.
[02:51:09.224 --> 02:51:18.687]  Well, that's another great point that you just made, and let's get into something that's a little bit more fun and not so hardcore, but also interesting.
[02:51:18.687 --> 02:51:23.168]  I heard months ago that you'd been involved in a secret film project.
[02:51:23.168 --> 02:51:24.768]  We now know what it is.
[02:51:24.768 --> 02:51:32.730]  What more can you tell us about your project with the Wachowski brothers, of course, of Matrix and V for Vendetta fame?
[02:51:32.730 --> 02:51:34.211]  I'll tell you what.
[02:51:34.211 --> 02:51:38.692]  That was the most bizarre movie shoot I've ever been on in my life.
[02:51:39.640 --> 02:51:44.343]  I have no idea what the end result of this movie will be.
[02:51:44.343 --> 02:51:47.004]  I haven't got a clue.
[02:51:47.004 --> 02:51:48.445]  And I'll tell you why.
[02:51:48.445 --> 02:51:54.088]  These guys, they're way out there, but they're great people, I'll tell you that.
[02:51:54.088 --> 02:51:57.871]  But these guys are on another level when it comes to creativity.
[02:51:57.871 --> 02:52:01.793]  Alex, what they did to me, here was my role.
[02:52:02.853 --> 02:52:07.299]  They brought me in and I spent an hour and a half... Here's what I do know.
[02:52:07.299 --> 02:52:10.283]  The movie will take place a hundred years in the future.
[02:52:11.562 --> 02:52:20.990]  So I come in and they do an hour and a half makeup job on me to where they put me in almost like a wetsuit type thing.
[02:52:20.990 --> 02:52:27.194]  They gave me multi-colored dreadlocks all the way down to the middle of my back and my shoulders.
[02:52:27.194 --> 02:52:34.360]  I got a big huge Fu Manchu type goatee beard with the beads in it and all that stuff.
[02:52:34.360 --> 02:52:38.924]  And then they gave me in the center of my forehead almost, it looked like almost a third eye.
[02:52:40.197 --> 02:52:42.758]  Right?
[02:52:42.758 --> 02:52:44.918]  And here was my part.
[02:52:44.918 --> 02:52:49.479]  I didn't have to memorize the line.
[02:52:49.479 --> 02:53:07.183]  Lana Wachowski sat across from me and simply all they wanted to do was ask me questions about how I felt about the war in Iraq and the whole Bush-Cheney thing and all of that stuff and they allowed me to just vent.
[02:53:08.368 --> 02:53:17.211]  But the way I looked, did you ever see John Travolta, what he looked like, and it was a bomb of a movie, but that thing, Battlefield Earth?
[02:53:17.211 --> 02:53:18.352]  Oh yes, I saw it.
[02:53:18.352 --> 02:53:22.373]  That's about what I looked like, even more bizarre.
[02:53:22.373 --> 02:53:32.817]  And so I'm sitting there looking this bizarre, talking about things that are a passion to me right now, and just allowed to free wheel.
[02:53:33.735 --> 02:53:36.698]  So I'm going to be very, very interested.
[02:53:36.698 --> 02:53:40.882]  I can't wait to see what in the hell this movie's about.
[02:53:40.882 --> 02:53:45.366]  And I'll get us back to the Huffington Post for a moment.
[02:53:45.366 --> 02:53:48.929]  Ariana Huffington was next.
[02:53:48.929 --> 02:53:51.011]  And they had her decked out.
[02:53:51.011 --> 02:53:55.035]  She looked like the Queen of Sheba or Cleopatra.
[02:53:55.035 --> 02:53:56.957]  And I assume they did the same thing with her.
[02:53:59.601 --> 02:54:01.001]  Well, no.
[02:54:01.001 --> 02:54:02.422]  I did it.
[02:54:02.422 --> 02:54:21.406]  There wasn't any blue screen or anything, but then they took me in another room and they did that modern technology where they have you face all different forward directions and do all that stuff with your body to where they can actually recreate you without you being there.
[02:54:22.148 --> 02:54:29.335]  Yeah, so they're going to insert the virtual reality version of Jesse Ventura into whatever dreamscape they want.
[02:54:29.335 --> 02:54:30.456]  Exactly.
[02:54:30.456 --> 02:54:38.984]  I can't wait for this film to come out because it was the most bizarre shoot that I've ever been on in my life.
[02:54:38.984 --> 02:54:47.592]  The only shoot that did it all compared to it was when I did that episode on the X-Files.
[02:54:48.956 --> 02:55:04.329]  Jose Chung from Outer Space, which I might add, by all the X-File crazy people that watch that, I shouldn't call them crazy, but all the, you know, the passion people that watch the X-Files and all that, it made, that one made it into, I think, the top 10 X-Files of all time.
[02:55:04.329 --> 02:55:10.455]  But this shoot was, the X-Files were strange, but this shoot beat the X-Files by 10.
[02:55:11.607 --> 02:55:12.487]  No idea whatsoever.
[02:55:12.487 --> 02:55:14.208]  Like I said, I don't even know what the whole script is.
[02:55:14.208 --> 02:55:17.368]  I went there, I did what they asked me to do, I was happy to do so.
[02:55:17.368 --> 02:55:18.769]  It was a great experience that day.
[02:55:18.769 --> 02:55:23.290]  They're super professional, they're great people and I have great respect for them.
[02:55:41.055 --> 02:55:43.260]  Were they secretive about it?
[02:55:43.260 --> 02:55:46.647]  Uh, yeah.
[02:55:46.647 --> 02:55:49.052]  I'd say they were because you never saw a script.
[02:55:50.069 --> 02:55:53.151]  They just told me what they wanted me to do.
[02:55:53.151 --> 02:55:54.632]  They put me into the wardrobe.
[02:55:54.632 --> 02:56:00.096]  They made me up look like, like I said, John Travolta on Battlefield Earth almost.
[02:56:00.096 --> 02:56:02.178]  And then I just sat there.
[02:56:02.178 --> 02:56:02.518]  You know what?
[02:56:02.518 --> 02:56:12.765]  It was so funny, Alex, because when I got into talking about it, and I think I achieved what they want, I completely forgot about what I looked like.
[02:56:12.765 --> 02:56:15.027]  And I'm sure that's what they wanted out of it.
[02:56:16.650 --> 02:56:20.992]  Well, certainly if it's criticizing the Iraq War, it's going to be powerful.
[02:56:20.992 --> 02:56:30.376]  I guess it's probably going to be like android, you know, robotic humans a hundred years from now with some history of what happened in our times.
[02:56:30.376 --> 02:56:31.336]  I would imagine.
[02:56:31.336 --> 02:56:33.657]  Alex, that's exactly what it is, basically.
[02:56:33.657 --> 02:56:38.619]  It's them assessing and analyzing what happened now.
[02:56:40.697 --> 02:56:43.740]  So it's gonna be like a history of what happened in our times.
[02:56:43.740 --> 02:56:44.560]  Yeah.
[02:56:44.560 --> 02:56:50.185]  Only a hundred years from now it's strange people like what you'll see what I look like.
[02:56:50.185 --> 02:57:06.638]  And it'll probably, I'm just guessing, we'll see if I'm right in a year or two whenever this comes out, it will probably then morph into the future and then a fictional future, kind of the Wachowski brothers guessing what human development and merger with the machines like Ray Kurzweil talks about happening.
[02:57:06.638 --> 02:57:08.040]  Could be.
[02:57:08.040 --> 02:57:09.481]  Your guess is as good as mine.
[02:57:09.994 --> 02:57:15.758]  Well, we're going to find out as soon as this movie comes out, and I guess you don't know what a tentative name is either.
[02:57:15.758 --> 02:57:16.438]  Nothing.
[02:57:16.438 --> 02:57:19.260]  All I did, it was a one-day shoot.
[02:57:19.260 --> 02:57:23.202]  They did what they called a favorite nations contract.
[02:57:23.202 --> 02:57:25.584]  That's where, when you go, oh, who else?
[02:57:25.584 --> 02:57:27.485]  Oh, they got Salman Rushdie, too.
[02:57:27.485 --> 02:57:28.266]  I didn't see him.
[02:57:28.266 --> 02:57:33.449]  I saw, I'm trying to recall the list of all the people they got, but Salman Rushdie's going to be in it.
[02:57:34.460 --> 02:57:34.960]  I don't know.
[02:57:55.089 --> 02:57:56.990]  Oh yeah, I'm going to be real interested to see this film.
[02:58:18.797 --> 02:58:19.558]  Incredible.
[02:58:19.558 --> 02:58:20.458]  Jesse, we're going to come back.
[02:58:20.458 --> 02:58:22.159]  We've got two more segments with you.
[02:58:22.159 --> 02:58:24.621]  I want to start in-depth getting into the book.
[02:58:24.621 --> 02:58:26.022]  Already a best-seller, folks.
[02:58:26.022 --> 02:58:27.823]  Only been out, what, four or five days?
[02:58:27.823 --> 02:58:28.964]  Came out Monday.
[02:58:28.964 --> 02:58:30.285]  It's March 12th.
[02:58:30.285 --> 02:58:32.146]  Came out March 8th.
[02:58:32.146 --> 02:58:34.928]  American Conspiracies with Governor Jesse Ventura.
[02:58:34.928 --> 02:58:37.910]  We'll go through these hardcore chapters and more.
[02:58:37.910 --> 02:58:38.910]  Straight ahead.
[02:58:38.910 --> 02:58:39.771]  Stay with us.
[02:58:43.675 --> 02:58:46.277]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:59:08.670 --> 02:59:15.035]  For example, with each pre-production order of three seven-day responders, they'll ship a fourth week of food free.
[02:59:15.035 --> 02:59:17.196]  That's buy three, get one free.
[02:59:17.196 --> 02:59:20.098]  They'll take orders from now until March 22nd.
[02:59:20.098 --> 02:59:27.664]  The following week, they'll produce huge runs of the pre-ordered food, passing the savings to you in this buy three, get one free program.
[02:59:28.064 --> 02:59:30.946]  Folks, this is the best chance to stock up you'll ever see.
[02:59:30.946 --> 02:59:32.407]  Another example?
[02:59:32.407 --> 02:59:35.449]  Buy nine months worth of food and get three months free.
[02:59:35.449 --> 02:59:40.752]  You've got to go to efoodsdirect.com slash Alex for the food buy of a lifetime.

[02:59:54.255 --> 02:59:56.660]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.660 --> 02:59:59.425]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:29.947 --> 03:00:33.470]  I tell you, Jesse Ventura, he is the real deal.
[03:00:33.470 --> 03:00:37.893]  He said, I'm gonna produce this show the way I want, I'm gonna find out the truth.
[03:00:37.893 --> 03:00:43.057]  He believed global warming was real, found out it was a fraud, admitted he was wrong.
[03:00:43.057 --> 03:00:46.720]  He didn't really believe Manchurian candidates were real, went to the research, it was there.
[03:00:46.720 --> 03:00:47.381]  Harped.
[03:00:48.513 --> 03:00:54.775]  I mean, uh, the global death plot, the global extermination plan, and now the show is picked back up.
[03:00:54.775 --> 03:00:57.075]  It'll be back on, I guess, in the next year or so.
[03:00:57.075 --> 03:01:01.096]  Looking to start shooting again coming up in, uh, the middle of the summer.
[03:01:01.096 --> 03:01:04.397]  Uh, we've only got this segment and one more with Jesse Ventura.
[03:01:04.397 --> 03:01:06.958]  And, uh, Jesse, let's, let's walk through the book here.
[03:01:06.958 --> 03:01:10.439]  I'm gonna get a document cam shot for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[03:01:10.439 --> 03:01:11.499]  I don't want to say...
[03:01:12.583 --> 03:01:14.244]  Hardcore, the most frightening.
[03:01:14.244 --> 03:01:17.206]  Well, to me, in our modern times, you know, naturally 9-11.
[03:01:17.206 --> 03:01:22.689]  Because that's what set the table for everything that's going on right now.
[03:01:32.222 --> 03:01:45.353]  Now, for in my lifetime, I think it was the assassination of Jack Kennedy because I believe when they could take out our president, it gave them great courage to do anything they wanted.
[03:01:45.353 --> 03:01:47.775]  Take out our president and get away with it.
[03:01:47.775 --> 03:01:53.000]  That gave them great courage that if you can kill the president and get away with it, you can get away with anything.
[03:01:55.683 --> 03:01:56.243]  Absolutely.
[03:01:56.243 --> 03:02:03.508]  I mean, if they could kill him in plain view as a message to those that are informed that, hey, this is a dictatorship of the CIA.
[03:02:03.508 --> 03:02:04.089]  What do you think?
[03:02:04.089 --> 03:02:05.350]  Well, you may not have seen it.
[03:02:05.350 --> 03:02:11.794]  About a month ago, Ron Paul gave a speech and said, there's been a coup in America, the CIA ships in the drugs, and they run America.
[03:02:12.896 --> 03:02:23.925]  Well, I don't know if they run America, but they damn sure do the drug business, because that's how they're able to do the clandestine things that they can do without having to report it to the Congress.
[03:02:23.925 --> 03:02:26.787]  See, the Congress allocates all the money.
[03:02:26.787 --> 03:02:41.239]  But if they can get money from an outside source, well, then they're not responsible to Congress, so then they become rogues or cowboys out there, and they can literally do any type of operation they want without clearing it with anything.
[03:02:41.239 --> 03:02:41.599]  Is this...
[03:02:43.078 --> 03:02:48.344]  What book are you most proud of?
[03:02:48.344 --> 03:03:01.819]  Creative-wise, I'm most proud of Don't Start the Revolution Without Me, but excitement, interest-wise, I like this one the best because this one is not about Jesse Ventura.
[03:03:01.819 --> 03:03:04.062]  You know, my first three books were all about me.
[03:03:04.742 --> 03:03:09.083]  And so this is the first book I've done where I'm not the focus of the book.
[03:03:09.083 --> 03:03:21.947]  The focus of the book is the Fourteen Conspiracies, so it's a new level of my writing now, along with Dick, of going to something that doesn't necessarily mean it's about Jesse Ventura, that it's about something else.
[03:03:23.183 --> 03:03:26.306]  And folks, you may think you know it all, but you'll learn something of this book.
[03:03:26.306 --> 03:03:27.547]  It's a great quick read.
[03:03:27.547 --> 03:03:30.270]  It's a thick book, but it goes very quickly.
[03:03:30.270 --> 03:03:33.513]  You get addicted to each chapter, wanting more of the information.
[03:03:33.513 --> 03:03:38.158]  Buy the book, read it, then give it to a family or a member or somebody at work.
[03:03:38.158 --> 03:03:42.462]  Wake somebody up, because the people are ready to be awakened now.
[03:03:42.462 --> 03:03:44.624]  Jesse, can you feel the awakening taking place?
[03:03:45.004 --> 03:03:52.220]  Well, yeah, I really am, and I can feel it in many, many ways, and I'll give you two easy ways.
[03:03:52.220 --> 03:03:54.725]  Every time I fly to Chicago or here,
[03:03:55.985 --> 03:04:01.930]  I get recognized and all the people of Illinois come up to me and say, hey, we need you to be our governor.
[03:04:01.930 --> 03:04:07.234]  Because, of course, the last two governors they've had, Governor Ryan and the other guy, are going to jail.
[03:04:07.234 --> 03:04:10.796]  Now I'm in New York.
[03:04:10.796 --> 03:04:17.001]  You can't believe all the New Yorkers in Manhattan begging me to move to New York and become their governor.
[03:04:17.461 --> 03:04:28.004]  What I feel happening right now, Alex, is a true grassroots movement of total disgust and untrust with our government, which hurts me.
[03:04:28.004 --> 03:04:31.445]  It really does, because I love this country.
[03:04:31.445 --> 03:04:44.128]  And to watch the people who are now... Why should they be put in a position to where they can't have respect, and they can't have credibility, and they can't have trust in their elected officials?
[03:04:44.688 --> 03:04:45.469]  Governor, stay there.
[03:04:45.469 --> 03:04:47.950]  Let's come back and finish up with that thought.
[03:04:47.950 --> 03:04:50.812]  Then I'm going to ask you about the naked body scanners.
[03:04:50.812 --> 03:04:54.554]  Will you let them record your naked body or that of your wife or children?
[03:04:54.554 --> 03:04:56.615]  All Americans have to ask that question.
[03:04:56.615 --> 03:04:58.156]  We'll be right back with Jesse Ventura.
[03:05:01.698 --> 03:05:08.343]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[03:05:08.343 --> 03:05:13.487]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[03:05:13.487 --> 03:05:22.233]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[03:05:22.233 --> 03:05:26.296]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[03:05:26.296 --> 03:05:28.258]  Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[03:05:30.718 --> 03:05:35.302]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[03:05:35.302 --> 03:05:39.145]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[03:05:39.145 --> 03:05:40.386]  Others don't.
[03:05:40.386 --> 03:05:42.528]  We turn jeans inside out.
[03:05:42.528 --> 03:05:44.309]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[03:05:44.309 --> 03:05:47.191]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[03:05:47.191 --> 03:05:51.435]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.
[03:05:51.435 --> 03:05:53.817]  So you can ride all day with confidence.
[03:05:53.817 --> 03:05:56.539]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[03:05:56.539 --> 03:05:58.901]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[03:05:58.901 --> 03:05:59.762]  Others don't.
[03:06:02.412 --> 03:06:06.436]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:06:06.436 --> 03:06:09.678]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:06:09.678 --> 03:06:14.482]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:06:14.482 --> 03:06:20.868]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:06:20.868 --> 03:06:23.110]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[03:06:23.610 --> 03:06:24.831]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:06:24.831 --> 03:06:25.792]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:06:25.792 --> 03:06:27.914]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:06:42.546 --> 03:06:44.388]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[03:06:44.388 --> 03:06:49.814]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:06:49.814 --> 03:06:58.944]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:07:03.166 --> 03:07:05.187]  Remain in your houses.
[03:07:05.187 --> 03:07:10.951]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[03:07:10.951 --> 03:07:12.312]  Will they do it?
[03:07:12.312 --> 03:07:14.934]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[03:07:14.934 --> 03:07:20.858]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[03:07:21.378 --> 03:07:23.580]  Think it can't happen here?
[03:07:23.580 --> 03:07:27.865]  Executive Order 10-9-90 locks down all highways.
[03:07:27.865 --> 03:07:32.750]  Executive Order 10-9-95 seizes control of all media outlets.
[03:07:32.750 --> 03:07:37.655]  Executive Order 10-9-98 controls all farms and food supplies.
[03:07:37.655 --> 03:07:42.479]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[03:07:43.380 --> 03:07:51.803]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions about how to survive it, go to MartialLawSurvival.com.
[03:07:51.803 --> 03:07:54.304]  That's MartialLawSurvival.com.
[03:07:54.304 --> 03:07:57.365]  Go to MartialLawSurvival.com right now.
[03:07:57.365 --> 03:08:06.848]  You must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned.
[03:08:06.848 --> 03:08:08.169]  Big Brother.
[03:08:08.169 --> 03:08:09.109]  Mainstream Media.
[03:08:09.924 --> 03:08:11.665]  Government cover-ups.
[03:08:11.665 --> 03:08:13.266]  You want answers?
[03:08:13.266 --> 03:08:14.807]  Well, so does he.
[03:08:14.807 --> 03:08:19.009]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:19.009 --> 03:08:23.692]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:08:23.692 --> 03:08:37.459]  Coming up for the balance of the hour after Governor Ventura leaves us at the end of this segment, we've got a constitutional lawyer who got the policy change at the Denver County Courthouse where they were naked body scanning even children.
[03:08:38.169 --> 03:08:42.632]  Now Homeland Security, we played a video from Homeland Security two days ago here on air if you missed it.
[03:08:42.632 --> 03:08:48.016]  It's in the archives at PrisonPlanet.tv where they're going to have mobile naked body scanner trucks.
[03:08:49.076 --> 03:08:50.837]  Well, first of all, Alex, I've been through a lot.
[03:09:18.371 --> 03:09:19.112]  Oh my gosh.
[03:09:19.112 --> 03:09:19.792]  No, wait a minute.
[03:09:19.792 --> 03:09:21.533]  Let me explain.
[03:09:21.533 --> 03:09:24.055]  I had my hip replaced a few years ago.
[03:09:24.055 --> 03:09:25.676]  A couple, two years ago.
[03:09:25.676 --> 03:09:28.498]  So I've got carbon titanium steel.
[03:09:28.498 --> 03:09:29.878]  They did hip resurfacing.
[03:09:29.878 --> 03:09:33.641]  They covered the joint with carbon titanium steel.
[03:09:33.641 --> 03:09:39.965]  So every time I go through an airport, Governor Jesse Ventura gets wanted and searched.
[03:09:40.505 --> 03:09:42.107]  Because I set the beepers off.
[03:09:42.107 --> 03:10:02.147]  Well, the way it happened to me was, I was late for a flight out of Denver, and I wanted to get on the plane to get home, and they told me that if I went through that, I could make the plane faster because I wouldn't have to set a beeper off to where they could then have to sit there and wait to be wanded.
[03:10:02.888 --> 03:10:07.014]  So just simply to speed the process up, I went through one.
[03:10:07.014 --> 03:10:11.340]  But I think they're utterly absurd for the most part.
[03:10:11.340 --> 03:10:17.007]  But I mean, what are you going to do when you've got to get on a plane or use a plane if it's required to do it?
[03:10:17.007 --> 03:10:18.810]  I mean, what's going to happen to all of us then?
[03:10:20.741 --> 03:10:21.241]  I don't know.
[03:10:21.241 --> 03:10:29.244]  I understand that, but hurting our families through it, going through it to get into a ball game, this is clearly just meant to dominate us, to break our will, to make us submit.
[03:10:50.370 --> 03:10:52.733]  Well, yeah, and it's all about control.
[03:10:52.733 --> 03:10:54.635]  It's all about violating your rights.
[03:10:54.635 --> 03:10:55.857]  I mean, let's look at it now.
[03:10:55.857 --> 03:10:57.539]  They've shredded the Fourth Amendment.
[03:10:57.539 --> 03:11:07.010]  I read a book down in Mexico where every one of our emails and every one of our phone calls in this country can be, you know, has to pass through the government.
[03:11:07.534 --> 03:11:10.016]  Well, that's another subject I wanted to raise.
[03:11:10.016 --> 03:11:26.629]  Wired Magazine headline, Cybersecurity, the end of the open internet, and Cass Sunstein at the White House and others, they're saying they want fines, fees, taxes on quote, conspiracy theories, so taxes on ideas, or maybe it should be made illegal, and the Pentagon is openly taking the internet over.
[03:11:27.407 --> 03:11:35.453]  Oh yeah, no, I knew that that would happen because, you know, because the Internet was the one thing they didn't have control over.
[03:11:35.453 --> 03:11:44.979]  And for a while, and you know, and so they, uh, I knew absolutely that they couldn't let some rogue thing out there because where do you get your real information?
[03:11:44.979 --> 03:11:47.881]  Now let's be honest, there's a lot of BS on the Internet.
[03:11:47.881 --> 03:11:49.262]  You gotta sift your way through it.
[03:11:49.262 --> 03:11:50.803]  You don't know whether it's true or false all the time.
[03:11:50.803 --> 03:11:52.004]  But that's free speech!
[03:11:52.004 --> 03:11:55.406]  But the Internet is truly the only place where you can learn anything real.
[03:11:56.425 --> 03:12:08.895]  But as angry as people are, and as fast as the Awakening's happening, every time they try to censor InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or your Huffington Post article, it only makes people want to find out what the censorship is all about.
[03:12:08.895 --> 03:12:10.676]  Hopefully.
[03:12:10.676 --> 03:12:12.998]  And I'll make one last appeal that you say it.
[03:12:12.998 --> 03:12:19.743]  Hey, all them Alex Jones listeners out there, email that damn Huffington Post and ask why they censored me.
[03:12:21.092 --> 03:12:22.333]  Did you see the articles?
[03:12:22.333 --> 03:12:23.613]  And it isn't just Philadelphia.
[03:12:23.613 --> 03:12:24.674]  It's all over the country.
[03:12:24.674 --> 03:12:26.254]  Taxpayers pay for laptops.
[03:12:26.254 --> 03:12:28.355]  They give them to the kids at the schools.
[03:12:28.355 --> 03:12:31.837]  And the principals are watching the kids in their bedrooms, even at home.
[03:12:31.837 --> 03:12:33.317]  And how did we learn about this?
[03:12:33.317 --> 03:12:37.719]  The principals are going on TV, bragging about it, like it's a good thing.
[03:12:37.719 --> 03:12:39.080]  Oh yeah, I saw that.
[03:12:39.080 --> 03:12:44.722]  You know, Alex, we gotta wake them up, man.
[03:12:44.722 --> 03:12:48.964]  You know, people need to understand that this is supposed to be the country of freedom.
[03:12:49.562 --> 03:12:51.244]  This is not East Germany.
[03:12:51.244 --> 03:12:55.488]  This is not behind the Iron Curtain.
[03:12:55.488 --> 03:12:57.350]  But we're heading that way.
[03:12:57.350 --> 03:13:09.203]  It just seems that since there's so many countries in the world where that type of behavior does happen, and it seems that we're going in that direction rather than heading in the direction of freedom.
[03:13:10.709 --> 03:13:17.175]  His book, Jesse Ventura, American Conspiracies, only out five days already in the top ten bestseller list.
[03:13:17.175 --> 03:13:19.437]  Get it discounted with a free film.
[03:13:19.437 --> 03:13:23.681]  Nobody's offering that at InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[03:13:23.681 --> 03:13:25.082]  Governor, continuing here,
[03:13:31.408 --> 03:13:34.051]  With the book, but I have one final question overall.
[03:13:34.051 --> 03:13:40.918]  You've always questioned the system ever since you learned about JFK, you said 30 years ago, started researching it.
[03:13:40.918 --> 03:13:42.539]  But what has it been like for you?
[03:13:42.539 --> 03:13:53.591]  A transformation really going down the rabbit hole, really going into the matrix, really immersing yourself in what they call the conspiracy culture or the culture of simply asking questions.
[03:13:53.931 --> 03:14:04.635]  Well, I don't mind it because when I got done being governor, you know, you get kind of bored after that job and you gotta, you know, I'm young enough to where I need to focus on something else.
[03:14:04.635 --> 03:14:10.718]  And now I'm focusing on this and the thing that I like about it is the fact that it's reality.
[03:14:11.198 --> 03:14:21.604]  You know, you're not dealing with what Tom Clancy writes or what Vince Flynn writes where they write a great espionage book but it's all fiction and it's the product of their imagination.
[03:14:21.604 --> 03:14:28.768]  It's fun to get into things where you can deal with and read about names where you can put that name to a face.
[03:14:28.768 --> 03:14:33.110]  And I find that very intriguing and entertaining to me when I can do that.
[03:14:33.470 --> 03:14:33.970]  That's right.
[03:14:33.970 --> 03:14:49.036]  I mean, truth, they've always said, is a lot stranger than fiction, and reality is so much more complex and real, and it's just so empowering to actually be informed and be on a journey of knowledge, instead of just watching a television with a bunch of mindless sitcoms all day.
[03:14:49.036 --> 03:14:49.696]  Exactly.
[03:14:49.696 --> 03:14:50.816]  Although, wait a minute now.
[03:14:50.816 --> 03:14:52.797]  I do like The Young and the Restless, yeah.
[03:14:55.438 --> 03:14:57.159]  I know, I always read that about you.
[03:14:57.159 --> 03:14:58.480]  You are certainly a character.
[03:14:58.480 --> 03:14:59.240]  You are something else.
[03:14:59.240 --> 03:15:01.141]  What do you think your dad would think?
[03:15:01.141 --> 03:15:08.305]  Highly decorated World War II veteran, looking down from heaven or from wherever, and seeing what his son has done.
[03:15:08.305 --> 03:15:10.306]  I mean, what an amazing life.
[03:15:10.306 --> 03:15:12.627]  I mean, you've had one of the most interesting lives out there.
[03:15:12.967 --> 03:15:16.189]  Well, you know, I will tell you this, Alex.
[03:15:16.189 --> 03:15:23.272]  The major regret of my life is the fact that when I won governor, both my mother and father weren't there to see it.
[03:15:24.434 --> 03:15:27.476]  You know, and there's nothing I can do but get this.
[03:15:27.476 --> 03:15:29.196]  My mother predicted it.
[03:15:29.196 --> 03:15:40.802]  Not that I would win governor, but in the last weekend before my mom passed on and we knew what was going to happen, many friends and that came over and all that to talk to her.
[03:15:40.802 --> 03:15:50.286]  And they told me, she didn't do it in front of me, but she said to them, you keep an eye on him because he's going to do something very big.
[03:15:52.054 --> 03:15:53.114]  And this was back in 1995.
[03:15:53.114 --> 03:15:59.657]  All I had done was a suburban mayor, I was doing talk radio then.
[03:15:59.657 --> 03:16:04.138]  How did my mother know what was in store for me?
[03:16:04.138 --> 03:16:06.179]  Because you hadn't even thought of running for governor then.
[03:16:06.179 --> 03:16:08.640]  No, that was the farthest thing from my mind.
[03:16:08.640 --> 03:16:15.622]  I had been a mayor, I was successful, but I wanted to go back to the private sector again, which is where I was at at that time.
[03:16:15.622 --> 03:16:20.064]  But how did my mom, could she say that the last 48 hours of her life?
[03:16:21.007 --> 03:16:23.588]  Well, the time always goes by very quick with Jesse Ventura.
[03:16:23.588 --> 03:16:25.448]  We've only got about four minutes left.
[03:16:25.448 --> 03:16:34.731]  Fourteen chapters in the book expose the fake loan nuts, the big money plot to overthrow FDR, Bush's grandfather, the Nazi plan, Bush Sr.'
[03:16:34.711 --> 03:16:50.315]  's dad, the Kennedy assassination, the assassination of Malcolm X, Dr. Martin Luther King assassination, the assassination of Robert Kennedy, Watergate revisited, the CIA's war against Nixon, the Jonestown Massacre, October Surprise, the first stolen election, your government dealing drugs,
[03:16:50.695 --> 03:16:53.676]  The Stolen Elections 2004 and almost 08.
[03:16:53.676 --> 03:16:55.537]  What really happened on September 11th?
[03:16:55.537 --> 03:16:59.558]  The Wall Street Conspiracy and the Secret Plan to End American Democracy.
[03:16:59.558 --> 03:17:02.899]  Let's talk about 13 and 14 here and what people should get the book.
[03:17:02.899 --> 03:17:07.801]  Wall Street Conspiracy, briefly, and then the Secret Plan to End American Democracy, Shadow Government.
[03:17:08.416 --> 03:17:10.657]  Well, you know, they are what they are.
[03:17:10.657 --> 03:17:16.399]  You know, the Wall Street conspiracy, to me, is an attempt to monopolize for Goldman Sachs.
[03:17:16.399 --> 03:17:21.240]  They let Lehman Brothers fall on their face, and yet we prop up Goldman Sachs.
[03:17:21.240 --> 03:17:29.363]  And isn't it interesting that every Treasury Secretary we've had in how many administrations now has come out of Goldman Sachs?
[03:17:29.363 --> 03:17:30.363]  Almost every one.
[03:17:30.363 --> 03:17:31.123]  Yeah.
[03:17:31.123 --> 03:17:33.844]  Literally, in the last 30, 40 years, every one of them.
[03:17:33.844 --> 03:17:36.785]  You're telling me that they got the market cornered on smartness?
[03:17:37.546 --> 03:17:42.067]  The guy running the Greece collapse 10 years ago and today is Goldman Sachs.
[03:17:42.067 --> 03:17:43.628]  Exactly.
[03:17:43.628 --> 03:17:49.749]  You know, and so, and as far as taking away our democracy, well you see that right now happening.
[03:17:49.749 --> 03:18:04.673]  I mean, the shredding of our Constitution, the shredding of our Bill of Rights, the suspension of habeas corpus, and I will say this, those things are the things that have me most upset about President Obama, and of course the Patriot Act.
[03:18:04.673 --> 03:18:06.634]  Why haven't those things been repealed?
[03:18:07.194 --> 03:18:08.255]  He reauthorized it!
[03:18:08.255 --> 03:18:14.039]  The Democrats supposedly, they got both houses, they got the president, and yet they're not touching it.
[03:18:14.039 --> 03:18:19.303]  So it shows you clearly that there is no difference between the Democrats and Republicans.
[03:18:19.303 --> 03:18:20.804]  They all have the same thing in mind.
[03:18:21.843 --> 03:18:26.568]  And that's the real revolution, is taking the states back, third parties, it's starting to happen.
[03:18:26.568 --> 03:18:31.473]  But Obama's created a coffee party to control the left, the Republicans are taking over the Tea Party.
[03:18:31.473 --> 03:18:33.015]  What do you think of the Tea Parties?
[03:18:33.015 --> 03:18:38.941]  Well, the Tea Party, you know, I'll say this, Alex, I like it when new parties show up.
[03:18:39.651 --> 03:18:47.462]  Because I may not agree with them necessarily, but as long as they show up, that still gives us more choices than two.
[03:18:47.462 --> 03:18:49.765]  We could be on Coke and Pepsi.
[03:18:49.765 --> 03:18:54.973]  And so my big criticism of the Tea Party is that, first of all, they're not grassroots.
[03:18:54.973 --> 03:18:56.154]  They're being highly funded.
[03:18:56.915 --> 03:19:06.860]  And second of all is the fact that, uh, where were they if they're supposed to be a Tea Party and a constitutional protector against taxes and all this stuff?
[03:19:06.860 --> 03:19:12.883]  Well, where were they when Bush was in office shredding the Fourth Amendment and, uh, suspending habeas corpus?
[03:19:13.627 --> 03:19:23.695]  Absolutely, and Obama's continuing the signing statements, the executive orders, all of it, showing us that the same big money interests own the entire paradigm.
[03:19:23.695 --> 03:19:26.697]  Governor, I know you're going to be headed back to Mexico in the next few weeks.
[03:19:26.697 --> 03:19:30.360]  Look forward to seeing you with the TV show when you get back.
[03:19:30.360 --> 03:19:32.742]  Look forward to hanging out with you and the crew.
[03:19:32.742 --> 03:19:42.209]  And I just want to thank you for taking me along in this great journey, and it's just been wonderful working with you, and I look forward to all the great, great things you're going to do in the future, sir.
[03:19:42.589 --> 03:19:47.371]  First of all, Alex, I joined you on the journey because you were on the journey before I was.
[03:20:02.089 --> 03:20:04.593]  RFID chips are becoming more and more common.
[03:20:04.593 --> 03:20:10.160]  Right now there are hundreds of millions of new credit cards and passports that contain these tiny radios.
[03:20:10.160 --> 03:20:12.703]  How can you keep them from transmitting your information?
[03:20:12.703 --> 03:20:14.786]  Turn them off with ID Stronghold.
[03:20:14.786 --> 03:20:16.869]  Secure wallets and secure sleeves from
[03:20:16.869 --> 03:20:17.690]  We're good to go.
[03:20:39.932 --> 03:20:40.232]  We're good.
[03:21:01.648 --> 03:21:11.676]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[03:21:11.676 --> 03:21:18.121]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[03:21:18.121 --> 03:21:26.968]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[03:21:27.348 --> 03:21:36.533]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[03:21:36.533 --> 03:21:41.395]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[03:21:41.395 --> 03:21:42.936]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[03:21:42.936 --> 03:21:45.437]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.
[03:21:45.717 --> 03:21:49.039]  Call me today at 800-686-2237.
[03:21:49.039 --> 03:21:53.220]  I will give you a silver dollar free just for purchasing the book.
[03:21:53.220 --> 03:21:53.841]  Call today at 800-686-2237.
[03:21:53.841 --> 03:21:54.281]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[03:21:54.281 --> 03:21:57.082]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:21:57.082 --> 03:21:59.423]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:21:59.423 --> 03:22:00.404]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[03:22:12.210 --> 03:22:14.871]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:22:14.871 --> 03:22:21.273]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:22:21.273 --> 03:22:26.455]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:22:26.455 --> 03:22:36.439]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:22:36.559 --> 03:22:38.921]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:22:38.921 --> 03:22:40.502]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:22:40.502 --> 03:22:42.963]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:22:42.963 --> 03:22:45.085]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[03:22:45.085 --> 03:22:50.228]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:22:50.228 --> 03:22:55.251]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[03:22:55.251 --> 03:22:59.354]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:23:03.943 --> 03:23:10.247]  As the economy continues to decline, Patriots across the nation are preparing for the worst.
[03:23:10.247 --> 03:23:12.468]  The world is changing fast.
[03:23:12.468 --> 03:23:14.709]  Are you fully prepared?
[03:23:14.709 --> 03:23:17.891]  Or will you be forced to eat government soup?
[03:23:17.891 --> 03:23:28.637]  At PatriotFood.com, we offer you 135 pounds of dehydrated food and six varieties of canned meat for half price.
[03:23:28.637 --> 03:23:32.179]  And at SurvivalistSeeds.com, we now offer
[03:23:33.299 --> 03:23:39.961]  50 non-GMO varieties of vegetables and over 10,000 heirloom seeds.
[03:23:39.961 --> 03:23:44.822]  That's twice as many as our competition for the same price.
[03:23:44.822 --> 03:23:49.443]  Patriotfood.com and survivalistseeds.com.
[03:23:49.443 --> 03:23:52.364]  Food insurance, just in case.
[03:23:52.364 --> 03:23:57.005]  Owned by me, Big John Lipscomb, host of the Don't Tread on Me radio show.
[03:24:06.943 --> 03:24:11.465]  Well, got a long way to go and a short time to get there.
[03:24:11.465 --> 03:24:13.406]  Eastbound and down.
[03:24:13.406 --> 03:24:14.067]  Ah.
[03:24:14.067 --> 03:24:20.310]  The American people and the people of the world are waking up to the new world order.
[03:24:20.310 --> 03:24:22.271]  This has been one hell of a Friday edition.
[03:24:22.271 --> 03:24:26.693]  I'll be back live Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:24:26.693 --> 03:24:29.335]  Sun, never mind them breaks.
[03:24:29.335 --> 03:24:31.856]  Let it all hang out because we got a run to make.
[03:24:32.791 --> 03:24:35.112]  We're not shipping a bunch of beer in an 18-wheeler.
[03:24:35.112 --> 03:24:38.733]  We're bringing liberty and freedom and the Constitution.
[03:24:38.733 --> 03:24:50.296]  Well, a few months ago, I was amazed to see video of constitutional lawyer, very successful counselor, Gary Fielder, going into the county where Denver's at and saying no to the naked body scanner.
[03:24:50.296 --> 03:24:53.777]  And he got the policy changed because it violates child porn laws.
[03:24:53.777 --> 03:24:55.237]  18 and under, they don't scan you.
[03:24:55.237 --> 03:24:59.158]  People can now be patted down if they want because, you know, we're the evil prisoners.
[03:24:59.158 --> 03:25:01.759]  He couldn't even practice law there without doing this.
[03:25:02.239 --> 03:25:06.182]  They were blocking his access to the courts, violating his constitutional rights.
[03:25:06.182 --> 03:25:09.365]  And now we've shown Homeland Security 18-wheeler trucks.
[03:25:09.365 --> 03:25:12.828]  Speaking of 18-wheelers, the globalists have got their run to make.
[03:25:12.828 --> 03:25:17.212]  They say they're going to have them at concerts, outside malls, at highway checkpoints.
[03:25:17.212 --> 03:25:20.895]  So, as we told you, anything they do in the airport is a beta test for everywhere else.
[03:25:21.415 --> 03:25:27.759]  So when I heard that this gentleman was coming here to Austin, Texas, I wanted to get him in studio.
[03:25:27.759 --> 03:25:29.660]  So Gary Filder, it's great to have you here with us.
[03:25:29.660 --> 03:25:30.800]  Alex, thank you so much.
[03:25:30.800 --> 03:25:32.901]  What a wonderful place you have here.
[03:25:32.901 --> 03:25:34.823]  You don't really realize how great of an operation it is.
[03:25:35.956 --> 03:25:37.417]  Get here and get to walk around a little bit.
[03:25:37.417 --> 03:25:38.197]  Congratulations.
[03:25:38.197 --> 03:25:39.078]  You've really done a wonderful job.
[03:25:39.078 --> 03:25:40.739]  Well, it's not that amazing.
[03:25:40.739 --> 03:25:42.139]  It's cozy, but we just expanded.
[03:25:42.139 --> 03:25:43.940]  We're building a TV studio, but thank you.
[03:25:43.940 --> 03:25:44.961]  This is a short segment.
[03:25:44.961 --> 03:25:48.343]  I'm going to try to shut up here and get into the fight against the naked body scanners.
[03:25:48.343 --> 03:25:50.544]  I've been really not promoting it.
[03:25:50.544 --> 03:25:51.925]  $15,000 in prizes.
[03:25:51.925 --> 03:25:53.866]  We need to get a banner up on InfoWars and Prison Planet.
[03:25:53.866 --> 03:25:54.646]  I asked for that.
[03:25:54.646 --> 03:25:56.127]  We need to get the guys to do that.
[03:25:56.127 --> 03:26:00.769]  I know they're busy about the contest to expose the naked body scanners.
[03:26:00.769 --> 03:26:05.452]  But what you're doing is legal and you're traveling the country, but you're also talking about the overall attack
[03:26:07.373 --> 03:26:27.761]  Well, the naked body scanner story started when I went down to a local county, Douglas County, and I had protested a couple of other times and had been just completely searched, as I detailed on your show.
[03:26:27.761 --> 03:26:33.904]  So there just came a point where there had to be a breaking point, where I wasn't going to go through the scanner, and I wasn't going to be touched.
[03:26:34.606 --> 03:26:38.081]  I just got a call a couple days ago from an Oath Keeper on the plane.
[03:26:38.969 --> 03:26:42.891]  On the tarmac at San Francisco, outraged at what he had just gone through.
[03:26:42.891 --> 03:26:49.353]  He refused the scanner, and just like we talked about, they ran their hands up and down his legs... They grabbed your genitals!
[03:26:49.353 --> 03:26:50.933]  They grabbed your wife's genitals!
[03:26:50.933 --> 03:26:57.936]  They ran his fingers through his hair, and he was on the phone talking to me, outraged at what he had to go through.
[03:26:57.936 --> 03:27:03.518]  There was no third option of a metal detector, a wand... And clearly it's harassment!
[03:27:03.518 --> 03:27:05.799]  There's no legitimate reason for it.
[03:27:06.400 --> 03:27:12.323]  Name one instance where an American got on a plane and flew it into a building.
[03:27:12.323 --> 03:27:20.347]  Name one instance where, you know, a guy went down to the commercial airline and did anything other than try to get on to a plane.
[03:27:20.347 --> 03:27:24.709]  So it's an issue where people are just going to have to stand up for their rights.
[03:27:24.709 --> 03:27:26.570]  And I heard you talking to Mr. Ventura.
[03:27:27.071 --> 03:27:28.972]  At first, you're going to have to be searched.
[03:27:28.972 --> 03:27:31.153]  Do not go through that body scanner.
[03:27:31.153 --> 03:27:34.114]  That's an absolute degradation of your rights.
[03:27:34.114 --> 03:27:44.680]  The idea of having a naked picture of me stored on a hard drive is repugnant enough to actually have to go through the... And a month ago, they said it was going to be voluntary.
[03:27:44.680 --> 03:27:47.841]  Now they're saying, oh, maybe it will be mandatory.
[03:27:47.841 --> 03:27:49.742]  Well, there's going to have to be an alternative.
[03:27:49.742 --> 03:27:51.703]  We got to thinking about it back in Denver.
[03:27:51.703 --> 03:27:53.764]  It's not just about getting on a plane.
[03:27:53.764 --> 03:27:55.705]  What if you get on a plane and then you can't get back?
[03:27:56.983 --> 03:27:58.284]  What about your family?
[03:27:58.284 --> 03:27:59.864]  What about your business waiting for you?
[03:27:59.864 --> 03:28:02.806]  What if you get stranded because you just stand up for your constitutional rights?
[03:28:02.806 --> 03:28:04.286]  So we all know where this is going.
[03:28:04.286 --> 03:28:05.787]  This is going to the federal court.
[03:28:05.787 --> 03:28:07.428]  They're going to have to decide this.
[03:28:07.428 --> 03:28:10.209]  They're going to have to decide this on the issue of privacy.
[03:28:10.209 --> 03:28:17.372]  And so there's a lot of cases that have come out in favor of reproductive rights and things like that, which sort of
[03:28:17.976 --> 03:28:18.357]  I think?
[03:28:30.735 --> 03:28:32.176]  Uh, connected with the right to travel.
[03:28:32.176 --> 03:28:33.636]  And a presumption of innocence.
[03:28:33.636 --> 03:28:36.318]  You know, they sell it like, oh, we don't discriminate.
[03:28:36.318 --> 03:28:38.299]  Everyone is tracked and traced.
[03:28:38.299 --> 03:28:45.462]  But then, in reality, that gets rid of any type of probable cause or due process where, oh, you have rights to have no rights.
[03:28:45.462 --> 03:28:46.742]  Right, you have rights to have no rights.
[03:28:46.742 --> 03:28:49.604]  Now, this is why I'm so excited about the issue of sovereignty.
[03:28:49.604 --> 03:28:54.706]  Because in order to look somebody in the eye and say no, in order to say, hey, I'd rather not do that,
[03:28:55.149 --> 03:29:10.442]  Whether it be acting like a monkey on the side of the road at the direction of a police officer, whether it be completely having your body touched or having your naked body photographed, at some point you got to be able to square up and say, no sir, I'd really rather not do that.
[03:29:10.442 --> 03:29:13.364]  And that requires the consciousness of a sovereign.
[03:29:13.976 --> 03:29:18.598]  Not the consciousness of a slave that says, you know, no, no, I don't want to do that, I'm scared.
[03:29:18.598 --> 03:29:23.781]  The consciousness of a sovereign that stands up and says, no sir, there's going to have to be another option.
[03:29:23.781 --> 03:29:25.502]  And they're always pushing the boundaries.
[03:29:25.502 --> 03:29:29.164]  Now they say suicide bombers may have fake breast implants.
[03:29:29.164 --> 03:29:30.984]  We need to x-ray you.
[03:29:30.984 --> 03:29:31.765]  And this system already
[03:29:32.125 --> 03:29:34.086]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:34.086 --> 03:29:35.086]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:03.254 --> 03:30:07.215]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:30:07.215 --> 03:30:16.076]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[03:30:16.076 --> 03:30:20.697]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.

[03:31:03.138 --> 03:31:07.169]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:31:07.169 --> 03:31:10.418]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:31:10.418 --> 03:31:11.842]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[03:31:12.526 --> 03:31:15.207]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:31:15.207 --> 03:31:21.590]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:31:21.590 --> 03:31:27.133]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:31:27.133 --> 03:31:36.777]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:31:36.877 --> 03:31:39.238]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:31:39.238 --> 03:31:40.818]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:31:40.818 --> 03:31:43.278]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:31:43.278 --> 03:31:45.399]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:31:45.399 --> 03:31:50.540]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[03:32:06.357 --> 03:32:08.318]  Afraid to answer it?
[03:32:08.318 --> 03:32:10.220]  Afraid to answer your door?
[03:32:10.220 --> 03:32:17.505]  Did you know that debt settlement, bankruptcy, and attorneys will cost you about ten times more than you would legally be required to pay creditors?
[03:32:17.505 --> 03:32:19.746]  These are not ways to help you get out of debt.
[03:32:19.746 --> 03:32:21.748]  They are expensive payment plans.
[03:32:21.748 --> 03:32:23.589]  And if you're in debt already, does it make
[03:32:26.186 --> 03:32:26.967]  I think so.

[03:33:15.883 --> 03:33:23.467]  I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors that have made today's radio show with Bob Chapman, Jesse Ventura, and now our guest in studio, Possible.

[03:33:57.821 --> 03:34:00.382]  And also MySolar Backup, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:34:00.382 --> 03:34:01.162]  Great little units.
[03:34:01.582 --> 03:34:02.943]  We've been promoting these for two years.
[03:34:02.943 --> 03:34:04.345]  Our listeners just love them.
[03:34:04.345 --> 03:34:06.226]  You can buy a bunch of them, run your own house.
[03:34:06.226 --> 03:34:11.011]  It's a solar panel, a little control unit, the battery unit that saves it.
[03:34:11.011 --> 03:34:13.033]  Have you lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch?
[03:34:13.033 --> 03:34:14.034]  Well, this is the way to do it.
[03:34:14.034 --> 03:34:18.958]  Unlike gas generators, this great little solar generator runs quietly and emits no fumes.
[03:34:18.958 --> 03:34:22.962]  So go to MySolarBackup.com to request a free information package today.

[03:34:30.872 --> 03:34:38.702]  The government doesn't own the sun yet, folks, so take action today, MySolarBackup.com.
[03:34:38.702 --> 03:34:39.944]  Now, going back to Gary Fielder.
[03:34:41.400 --> 03:34:47.922]  Gary, continuing, my issue here is it's not just this act of submission, you know, this pointlessness.
[03:34:47.922 --> 03:34:54.665]  They helped the underwear bomber get on the plane, that's now admitted, but they bury it in footnotes in the news.
[03:34:54.665 --> 03:34:57.106]  Now they have, have you seen the video of these big mobile trucks?
[03:34:57.766 --> 03:34:59.806]  In fact, we played that, what, Tuesday.
[03:34:59.806 --> 03:35:01.827]  Try to pull that up just while he's talking.
[03:35:01.827 --> 03:35:05.508]  Show the mobile trucks with body scanners, brain scanners.
[03:35:05.508 --> 03:35:07.048]  Here's AFP today.
[03:35:07.048 --> 03:35:08.848]  Brain scans can read people's thoughts.
[03:35:08.848 --> 03:35:14.989]  You know, as a lawyer, it took decades to prove that the lie detectors were quackery.
[03:35:14.989 --> 03:35:17.450]  It was just a way to send innocent people to prison.
[03:35:17.450 --> 03:35:18.490]  This is even worse.
[03:35:18.490 --> 03:35:22.331]  So, as bad as it sounds, this is only the beginning, these body scanners.
[03:35:23.356 --> 03:35:24.457]  Please continue.
[03:35:24.457 --> 03:35:30.222]  Well, again, it comes down to having, first of all, enough intestinal fortitude to say no.
[03:35:30.222 --> 03:35:32.644]  But when you say no, then what's going to happen?
[03:35:32.644 --> 03:35:35.126]  It sort of shifts the burden, if you will.
[03:35:35.126 --> 03:35:37.548]  And I don't want to put anybody in danger.
[03:35:37.548 --> 03:35:41.271]  Nobody wants to get their arm twisted up their back or arrested.
[03:35:41.271 --> 03:35:47.716]  But when you're at an airport and you're just simply standing up for your right to privacy, the next issue becomes the alternative.
[03:35:47.961 --> 03:35:50.964]  They're going to have to give an alternative to children.
[03:35:50.964 --> 03:35:52.246]  That's set in stone.
[03:35:52.246 --> 03:35:53.748]  The British government said that.
[03:35:53.748 --> 03:36:03.519]  So, if you're going to run 16 and 17-year-old young men and women through, well, why can't an old 46-year-old like me go in that line and just have to put up with the search?
[03:36:03.519 --> 03:36:05.200]  I'll do that twice.
[03:36:05.200 --> 03:36:07.643]  But at some point, the federal court's going to have to issue that.
[03:36:07.643 --> 03:36:08.384]  Or your state court.
[03:36:08.697 --> 03:36:15.622]  I don't think the state court will have jurisdiction over TSA, so ultimately it's going to have to wind up in a federal court.
[03:36:15.622 --> 03:36:18.505]  And we've got to buck this or they're going to put it in everywhere, like the courthouse.
[03:36:18.505 --> 03:36:20.406]  Well, this has to be nipped in the bud now.
[03:36:20.406 --> 03:36:21.727]  And you had success.
[03:36:21.727 --> 03:36:27.912]  Well, I had success in the courthouse because it was a little bit different because you had to go to court.
[03:36:27.912 --> 03:36:29.393]  Witnesses were subpoenaed to court.
[03:36:29.393 --> 03:36:32.455]  Lawyers were on the docket to be there.
[03:36:32.455 --> 03:36:35.277]  There's always this issue of, well, just don't get on the plane.
[03:36:35.277 --> 03:36:35.838]  Take a plane.
[03:36:36.488 --> 03:36:37.568]  Drive your car.
[03:36:37.568 --> 03:36:42.550]  That kind of goes against the right to travel, but they want to use their ability to reasonably regulate.
[03:36:42.550 --> 03:36:45.852]  So all of those different issues are going to clash.
[03:36:45.852 --> 03:36:47.392]  So now's the time to do it.
[03:36:47.392 --> 03:36:52.134]  Now's the time to get in to federal court and get this issue litigated.
[03:36:52.134 --> 03:36:53.555]  Now, what does that mean?
[03:36:53.555 --> 03:36:55.656]  That means waiting.
[03:36:55.656 --> 03:36:56.996]  That means being patient.
[03:36:56.996 --> 03:36:58.857]  That means picking the perfect plaintiff.
[03:36:58.857 --> 03:37:03.319]  That means trying to get it into the jurisdiction that you think is going to be most favorable.
[03:37:03.655 --> 03:37:07.817]  Not just filing some injunction tomorrow down at your local courthouse.
[03:37:07.817 --> 03:37:09.998]  So this is going to have to be a sophisticated fight.
[03:37:09.998 --> 03:37:11.359]  That's what it's going to have to be.
[03:37:11.359 --> 03:37:14.541]  But it needs to be done now before they're all installed.
[03:37:14.541 --> 03:37:18.603]  I went through Denver International Airport two weeks ago and they had two lines.
[03:37:18.603 --> 03:37:20.904]  One with the scanner, one without.
[03:37:20.904 --> 03:37:23.845]  It was about 50-50, so I got to choose.
[03:37:23.845 --> 03:37:28.728]  So they're just trying to integrate them in so that the next time I go down there, there's going to be two.
[03:37:29.335 --> 03:37:32.957]  There's going to have to be a third line for some reasonable alternative.
[03:37:32.957 --> 03:37:36.899]  So the real issue is what is the reasonable alternative?
[03:37:36.899 --> 03:37:43.682]  I think I could convince a federal judge that having your body touched is just as bad as having your body photographed.
[03:37:43.682 --> 03:37:53.006]  Well, there's also the angle separately to go after Chertoff, who made the orders for these billions of dollars of machines when he was the head of Homeland Security and now makes money from it.
[03:37:53.006 --> 03:37:54.767]  There's more than one way to skin a cat as well.
[03:37:54.767 --> 03:37:56.948]  Well, it's not just a matter of inconvenience.
[03:37:56.948 --> 03:37:58.949]  We've all been grossly
[03:37:59.870 --> 03:38:03.033]  Inconvenience, just trying to get onto a plane.
[03:38:03.033 --> 03:38:05.935]  So we just stand there and take that for an hour and a half.
[03:38:05.935 --> 03:38:11.680]  This is seriously about touching your body or taking a photograph of your naked body.
[03:38:11.680 --> 03:38:15.824]  I think that's about as invasive as you can get.
[03:38:15.824 --> 03:38:18.826]  Other than extracting bodily fluid, we're right at it.
[03:38:18.826 --> 03:38:20.007]  Well, they do that in Texas now.
[03:38:20.007 --> 03:38:21.649]  They take blood without warrants at checkpoints.
[03:38:22.418 --> 03:38:25.059]  First, it was these fake warrants they would swear out for everybody.
[03:38:25.059 --> 03:38:28.540]  Now it's just, legislature said, yeah, the no more Fourth Amendment.
[03:38:28.540 --> 03:38:34.823]  Well, you know, people come up to me as a criminal lawyer and they always ask about DUI, what should I do when I get pulled over.
[03:38:34.823 --> 03:38:40.865]  And, you know, I don't give that advice of crack the windshield, you know, slip your driver's license out.
[03:38:40.865 --> 03:38:41.405]  I don't say that.
[03:38:41.405 --> 03:38:46.087]  I say, roll down your window, be pleasant, be nice, but be short.
[03:38:46.087 --> 03:38:48.608]  You don't need to speak to the government.
[03:38:48.608 --> 03:38:50.269]  You don't need to get out of your vehicle.
[03:38:50.717 --> 03:38:54.139]  You need to show them your documentation and ask to move forward.
[03:38:54.139 --> 03:38:57.402]  At every level, you have to check that officer.
[03:38:57.402 --> 03:39:09.570]  Otherwise, you're going to be out of that car, you're going to be in front of headlights, jumping around on one foot, and spending the night... Well, the way to stop the DUI checkpoints is on the Fourth Amendment, obviously, but on top of that, the illegal aliens in 800-plus cities are given a free pass.
[03:39:09.570 --> 03:39:10.670]  That's discriminatory.
[03:39:10.670 --> 03:39:14.513]  Well, that's a whole different issue that's really hitting Denver hard because they...
[03:39:15.234 --> 03:39:38.776]  A local person whose child was unfortunately killed at a Baskin-Robbins has just sued the city and county of Denver, I believe the state of Colorado, and a couple of different agencies for continuously giving this particular gentleman who was driving pass after pass after pass on habitual traffic offender tickets, driving under revocation, but they just give him a pass, so sure enough... Let me guess, he was an illegal?
[03:39:39.426 --> 03:39:41.167]  Yes.
[03:39:41.167 --> 03:39:43.529]  In Austin, I've talked to the county officials.
[03:39:43.529 --> 03:39:47.012]  They say they're allowed to run people over and they're let go.
[03:39:47.012 --> 03:39:48.493]  I mean, it's God level.
[03:39:48.493 --> 03:39:51.975]  A cop can't be drunk driving and kill somebody.
[03:39:51.975 --> 03:39:55.378]  I mean, literally, I ought to change my name to, like,
[03:39:56.127 --> 03:39:58.830]  You know, Juan Gonzales and just be God.
[03:39:58.830 --> 03:40:06.397]  It sent a shiver through the spine of every police officer and every police chief and every politician who now has to deal with this issue.
[03:40:06.397 --> 03:40:09.420]  And so I'm not encouraging lawsuits, but I am.
[03:40:09.420 --> 03:40:12.362]  As much as we badmouth the federal court, that's why it's down the street.
[03:40:12.362 --> 03:40:14.845]  Well, we have to bring force to bear on people that are violating our rights.
[03:40:15.464 --> 03:40:17.247]  You're not going to find the remedy in state court.
[03:40:17.247 --> 03:40:22.895]  You're going to have to go to the federal court and file either injunctions, declaratory actions, lawsuits.
[03:40:22.895 --> 03:40:25.660]  I mean, if someone touches me, I consider that a harm.
[03:40:27.173 --> 03:40:30.274]  I'm asking a lot of questions here, and we're running out of time, and this is a great interview with you.
[03:40:30.274 --> 03:40:31.274]  I want to have you back.
[03:40:31.274 --> 03:40:35.216]  But the time we've got left, the 20 minutes we've got left, give us the website, tell us about the event.
[03:40:35.216 --> 03:40:37.076]  I'm told you've got a new DVD out.
[03:40:37.076 --> 03:40:38.197]  Tell us about all that.
[03:40:38.197 --> 03:40:41.818]  Okay, I'm working on a DVD that's coming out hopefully in August.
[03:40:41.818 --> 03:40:46.380]  I'm traveling the western side of the country giving seminars on sovereignty.
[03:40:46.380 --> 03:40:53.262]  Part of the problem that I see is that we carry around with us the consciousness of a slave.
[03:40:53.632 --> 03:40:54.493]  And it's not our fault.
[03:40:54.493 --> 03:40:56.094]  We were just brought up like that.
[03:40:56.094 --> 03:40:57.195]  We've capitulated.
[03:40:57.195 --> 03:40:59.857]  We're like a whore who has a pimp beating her up.
[03:40:59.857 --> 03:41:00.838]  And we've been brainwashed.
[03:41:00.838 --> 03:41:08.725]  That TV is just pounding us every day and commercials and all of the media that we see through newspapers, books.
[03:41:08.725 --> 03:41:12.709]  So the subconscious gets bombarded with a lot of information.
[03:41:12.709 --> 03:41:15.051]  To think of yourself as a sovereign is one thing.
[03:41:15.051 --> 03:41:18.173]  To know legally that you're a sovereign is another.
[03:41:18.173 --> 03:41:18.774]  So what I make
[03:41:20.025 --> 03:41:29.191]  I outline a seven-hour argument with a 200-page handout that absolutely outlines that your forefathers, Mr. Jones, they settled this country.
[03:41:29.191 --> 03:41:30.412]  They spilled their blood.
[03:41:30.412 --> 03:41:34.674]  They fought in the Revolutionary War, and they formed this nation, and they were declared sovereigns.
[03:41:34.674 --> 03:41:37.857]  And they were mental giants, celebrated the world over.
[03:41:37.857 --> 03:41:39.398]  We're going to do what they've set up.
[03:41:39.398 --> 03:41:41.159]  We're not going to follow this tyranny.
[03:41:41.739 --> 03:41:43.120]  Their posterity is you.
[03:41:43.120 --> 03:41:44.742]  Their posterity is me.
[03:41:44.742 --> 03:41:50.807]  So when I start talking about sovereignty, everybody always wants to talk about, whoa, that makes me better or that makes me more immune.
[03:41:50.807 --> 03:41:52.249]  It's not about that anymore.
[03:41:52.249 --> 03:41:54.631]  It's the responsibility that a sovereign has.
[03:41:54.631 --> 03:41:56.773]  It's the duty that a sovereign has.
[03:41:56.773 --> 03:41:58.094]  I'm missing a volleyball game tonight.
[03:41:58.573 --> 03:42:02.615]  I don't want to miss that volleyball game, but as a sovereign, it's my duty.
[03:42:02.615 --> 03:42:03.616]  You've got to do what you've got to do.
[03:42:03.616 --> 03:42:04.657]  And it's that sense of duty.
[03:42:04.657 --> 03:42:05.997]  I mean, it's not like it's even work.
[03:42:05.997 --> 03:42:13.202]  Once you're possessed by the animating spirit of liberty, as Thomas Jefferson said, with a fire of liberty in your mind, and then it spreads.
[03:42:13.202 --> 03:42:14.923]  Tell us about the event coming up in Austin.
[03:42:14.923 --> 03:42:18.985]  Okay, I'm at the AT&T Event Center tomorrow.
[03:42:18.985 --> 03:42:19.906]  Check-in is at 8.30.
[03:42:19.906 --> 03:42:23.488]  The seminar lasts from 9 to 4.
[03:42:23.488 --> 03:42:27.070]  There's breaks in the morning, and there's a break in the afternoon and lunch.
[03:42:27.765 --> 03:42:32.408]  The AT&T Event Center is at, I believe, the bottom of the tower by the water fountain down there.
[03:42:32.408 --> 03:42:38.752]  We've got a room set up for 65, and so it's a PowerPoint presentation with moving video and a handout.
[03:42:38.752 --> 03:42:40.173]  Uh-oh, you shouldn't have come on the show.
[03:42:40.173 --> 03:42:42.494]  You're going to turn away $500.
[03:42:42.494 --> 03:42:43.555]  People should still try to get in.
[03:42:43.775 --> 03:42:50.538]  Well, I do charge tuition of $100, which a lot of people criticize, but it does cost me a lot of- Hey, you had to pay to drive here.
[03:42:50.538 --> 03:42:51.519]  You had to pay to fly here.
[03:42:51.519 --> 03:42:52.479]  You know what?
[03:42:52.479 --> 03:42:54.621]  That's an enemy conditioning operation.
[03:42:54.621 --> 03:42:56.461]  You shouldn't sell a Jesse Ventura book.
[03:42:56.461 --> 03:42:58.683]  You shouldn't produce films and have your own operation.
[03:42:58.683 --> 03:43:03.405]  How are we ever going to fund ourselves when the government uses our own tax money to enslave us?
[03:43:03.405 --> 03:43:05.026]  No, people need to spend more money.
[03:43:05.026 --> 03:43:06.667]  They need to support everybody.
[03:43:06.667 --> 03:43:09.188]  That's what my show is, is a platform for people like you.
[03:43:09.898 --> 03:43:10.959]  Well, I really appreciate it.
[03:43:10.959 --> 03:43:15.661]  Just to get a flavor of what it will be like, there's a free video called Gig is Up.
[03:43:15.661 --> 03:43:20.464]  It's on my website, gigisup.net, and that kind of gives you an idea of where we're going with this.
[03:43:20.464 --> 03:43:21.684]  So this starts when in the morning?
[03:43:21.684 --> 03:43:27.707]  The check-in is at 8.30 and the seminar starts at 9, but I typically don't get going until about 9, 10 or 9.15.
[03:43:29.188 --> 03:43:40.151]  So, come by, and everybody that's been to the seminars, I've given one in Denver, Omaha, and L.A., have come out of there feeling an entirely different way.
[03:43:40.151 --> 03:43:44.552]  They walk out of there with their shoulders pinned back, thinking, alright, I'm going to find out about my family.
[03:43:44.552 --> 03:43:45.012]  Yeah, that's right.
[03:43:45.012 --> 03:43:56.195]  People think that it's our position to be slaves, and to be tasered and beat up and in scream debt, and for people to be rude to us, that government's God, and their paychecks go up, our paychecks go down.
[03:43:56.195 --> 03:43:57.296]  That's not the case.
[03:43:57.296 --> 03:43:58.836]  Okay, in the 15 minutes we've got left,
[03:43:59.156 --> 03:44:07.920]  Let's launch into your legal arguments against the naked body scanners and other unconstitutional issues and where you see this society going.
[03:44:07.920 --> 03:44:11.962]  Well, the hard thing to get in federal court is standing.
[03:44:11.962 --> 03:44:16.524]  You can't just go into federal court and say, hey, your honor, I want these body scanners out of the airport.
[03:44:16.524 --> 03:44:18.004]  I want them out of the courthouse.
[03:44:18.004 --> 03:44:19.565]  Well, you have to have harm.
[03:44:19.565 --> 03:44:22.266]  There has to be a remedy because you've suffered a violation.
[03:44:22.591 --> 03:44:24.833]  I'm not saying I'm going to be the one to do it.
[03:44:53.111 --> 03:44:58.696]  I wouldn't come to the court as a, you know, lowly citizen begging for mercy.
[03:44:58.696 --> 03:45:02.618]  I'd walk in there as a sovereign and say, Your Honor, I need redress.
[03:45:02.618 --> 03:45:03.759]  I need remedy.
[03:45:03.759 --> 03:45:07.222]  I need to get on a plane every now and then for my business, or it's going to be harmed.
[03:45:07.222 --> 03:45:09.243]  Because rights aren't given, they're demanded.
[03:45:09.243 --> 03:45:10.024]  They're taken.
[03:45:10.024 --> 03:45:15.548]  Well, they've been bestowed upon us by our Creator, and they're inalienable.
[03:45:15.548 --> 03:45:16.789]  And that's what we have to stand upon.
[03:45:17.350 --> 03:45:22.155]  That's not a document, fancy, handwritten thing that you hang on the wall.
[03:45:22.155 --> 03:45:27.861]  If you go to the statutes at large, Volume 1, Page 1 is the Declaration of Independence.
[03:45:27.861 --> 03:45:30.203]  It's as good a law as any law you're going to find.
[03:45:30.203 --> 03:45:39.152]  It's the Supreme Law, so I'm here, I'm here, I'm a federal judge, you've been forced to go through a naked body scanner, or they've groped you because you wouldn't, what do you say to me?
[03:45:39.804 --> 03:45:44.747]  If you're the judge, I'm going to say, Your Honor, thank you very much for hearing my case.
[03:45:44.747 --> 03:45:47.589]  We need redress here because, number one, I have a right to travel.
[03:45:47.589 --> 03:45:48.730]  That's an inalienable right.
[03:45:48.730 --> 03:45:51.072]  That doesn't have to be listed in the Bill of Rights.
[03:45:51.072 --> 03:45:52.393]  I have a right to travel.
[03:45:52.393 --> 03:45:56.796]  I have a right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.
[03:45:56.796 --> 03:45:59.898]  Now, whoever is on the other side is going to say, well, this is reasonable.
[03:45:59.898 --> 03:46:01.058]  And that's what I'm going to say.
[03:46:01.058 --> 03:46:02.119]  Show me an instance.
[03:46:02.119 --> 03:46:07.483]  I know some people take their Cessnas and that very unfortunate event you had here in your town about a month ago.
[03:46:07.483 --> 03:46:09.124]  I'm talking about a commercial airline.
[03:46:09.705 --> 03:46:13.767]  We go to get on a plane to conduct business or to visit family.
[03:46:13.767 --> 03:46:15.568]  We don't go to blow things up.
[03:46:15.568 --> 03:46:22.972]  They have methods in place which have worked for decades, and every time they haven't worked, it hasn't been one of us.
[03:46:22.972 --> 03:46:28.835]  It hasn't been a person who's born here, raised here, understands it's here.
[03:46:28.835 --> 03:46:33.257]  It's always been someone that doesn't necessarily connect with this country.
[03:46:33.257 --> 03:46:35.759]  And who's always above the law, like the illegals, killing everybody.
[03:46:35.759 --> 03:46:37.740]  But there's just this, there's this
[03:46:39.361 --> 03:46:42.743]  Effort to squeeze us down with everybody else.
[03:46:42.743 --> 03:46:44.843]  Show us to not show favoritism.
[03:46:44.843 --> 03:46:46.984]  I want favoritism.
[03:46:46.984 --> 03:46:50.266]  I'm a sovereign of this country, and I want favoritism.
[03:46:50.266 --> 03:46:52.007]  I've got my American passport.
[03:46:52.007 --> 03:46:53.347]  I've got my driver's license.
[03:46:53.347 --> 03:47:00.810]  I've submitted to a lot of the things that I don't necessarily... And that's the fake liberalism, is that like citizens are trash, everybody else is God.
[03:47:00.810 --> 03:47:01.271]  I don't understand.
[03:47:01.271 --> 03:47:03.212]  Government's God, illegals are God.
[03:47:03.212 --> 03:47:05.713]  I just flew out of the country to Italy about five months ago.
[03:47:05.713 --> 03:47:06.413]  I was welcomed.
[03:47:06.783 --> 03:47:10.164]  The gentleman asked me one question, stamped my passport, and said, have a nice day.
[03:47:10.164 --> 03:47:17.587]  I try to get back into my own country, and it's a four-hour process of disrobing, opening all of your luggage, being questioned.
[03:47:17.587 --> 03:47:20.368]  And that's why our tourism is dying, because people don't want to come here.
[03:47:20.368 --> 03:47:21.968]  They know a police state.
[03:47:21.968 --> 03:47:26.590]  And so, you always ask the question, what's the real underlying policy?
[03:47:26.590 --> 03:47:32.112]  Is the underlying policy really to stop a citizen from committing a terrorist act on a plane?
[03:47:33.103 --> 03:47:38.845]  The real policy, as you've exposed, is to get us used to being treated like sheep.
[03:47:38.845 --> 03:47:46.228]  To get us used to being herded into a line and forced to put our hands up and our head down and photograph.
[03:47:46.228 --> 03:47:47.909]  Look at public schools, they do that everywhere!
[03:47:47.909 --> 03:47:49.109]  It's outrageous is what it is.
[03:47:49.109 --> 03:47:51.310]  So there always has to be an alternative.
[03:47:52.770 --> 03:47:55.732]  That has to be reasonable, too.
[03:47:55.732 --> 03:47:57.232]  What's wrong with the wand?
[03:47:57.232 --> 03:48:02.514]  I disrobe, I take my belt off, I take my shoes off, I take my jacket off, I got four buckets on my head.
[03:48:02.514 --> 03:48:04.195]  All acts of submission.
[03:48:04.195 --> 03:48:08.937]  And then ultimately, though, I still have to be completely patted down without problem.
[03:48:08.937 --> 03:48:11.878]  And I see him at the airport grabbing people's testicles.
[03:48:11.878 --> 03:48:14.999]  They've never done that to me yet, but I'm gonna say, get your hands off that!
[03:48:15.686 --> 03:48:17.207]  I'm not going to let him get close anymore.
[03:48:17.207 --> 03:48:19.989]  Now, if I get shut down on a plane, I don't know what's going to happen.
[03:48:19.989 --> 03:48:21.049]  I'm going to miss a vacation.
[03:48:21.049 --> 03:48:22.090]  I'm going to be really upset.
[03:48:22.090 --> 03:48:24.691]  I'm going to miss a business meeting and have damage.
[03:48:24.691 --> 03:48:28.113]  But at some point, someone's going to have to go to the federal court.
[03:48:28.113 --> 03:48:33.777]  Now, this is a problem that I've had because I approach all my topics from a legal perspective.
[03:48:33.777 --> 03:48:39.480]  As sovereigns, we've set up our state and federal governments to have shared power.
[03:48:39.480 --> 03:48:42.562]  We need the judicial branch to start stepping up.
[03:48:43.038 --> 03:48:48.403]  I'm not here to criticize judges, but they need to step up.
[03:48:48.403 --> 03:48:50.005]  They're part of this fight.
[03:48:50.005 --> 03:48:52.687]  They're part of this movement, if you want to know.
[03:48:52.687 --> 03:48:55.049]  And they're getting promoted for being political whores.
[03:48:55.049 --> 03:48:57.211]  The citizens need to put pressure on them in the elections.
[03:48:57.211 --> 03:49:00.394]  They're pressurized to just treat everybody the same.
[03:49:00.394 --> 03:49:03.778]  They're pressurized to just get everybody through.
[03:49:03.778 --> 03:49:05.639]  I go to court every day, all day, Alex.
[03:49:05.639 --> 03:49:06.921]  Every day, all day.
[03:49:06.921 --> 03:49:08.322]  And I see that the pressure
[03:49:08.743 --> 03:49:08.883]  Is it?
[03:49:26.286 --> 03:49:29.310]  The real people who have the sovereignty in their blood.
[03:49:29.310 --> 03:49:30.771]  Now, that includes everybody.
[03:49:30.771 --> 03:49:32.213]  I'm not being exclusive here.
[03:49:32.213 --> 03:49:37.619]  I'm just saying, if you're part of this country, then you hold the power in your... Well, let's make a deal.
[03:49:37.619 --> 03:49:39.421]  Let's just say we're above the law like the illegals.
[03:49:39.421 --> 03:49:40.402]  No, no.
[03:49:40.402 --> 03:49:43.866]  I mean, that's unconstitutional, but I mean, that's what we're talking about here.
[03:49:43.866 --> 03:49:47.130]  Well, you know, people ask me all the time when I start talking about sovereignty.
[03:49:47.694 --> 03:49:50.977]  People say, well, do you mean a sovereign can drive down the road 100 miles an hour?
[03:49:50.977 --> 03:49:54.019]  And my response is, a sovereign's not going to drive down the road 100 miles an hour.
[03:49:54.019 --> 03:49:55.760]  Besides, that endangers others.
[03:49:55.760 --> 03:49:57.502]  That endangers others, of course.
[03:49:57.502 --> 03:50:09.170]  So, what I'm asking regular people, and I use that word people particularly, is to understand that it's not just glorified to be a king or queen.
[03:50:09.170 --> 03:50:10.832]  It holds enormous duty.
[03:50:10.832 --> 03:50:12.693]  It holds enormous responsibility.
[03:50:13.021 --> 03:50:21.307]  And despite the fact that we want to go watch football and we want to raise our kids in a fashion that... If we're this powerful sovereign, we better act like it!
[03:50:21.307 --> 03:50:24.169]  We now have a call to arms.
[03:50:24.169 --> 03:50:38.979]  That may not mean guns and rifles, but whatever a person can do to get involved in the next city council race, next DA's... And we're not going to save the world individually or with one action, but it's that spirit of action.
[03:50:38.979 --> 03:50:39.820]  In your community.
[03:50:40.763 --> 03:50:50.530]  Teaching your children, having a neighborhood session or meet-up, joining We Are Change, whatever it takes to just exercise your sovereignty.
[03:50:50.530 --> 03:50:56.774]  And in the end, it's about mass consciousness and information, because our biggest weapon is the dissemination of information.
[03:50:56.774 --> 03:50:57.795]  Gary Fielder, stay there.
[03:50:57.795 --> 03:51:00.556]  Final segment, key information, straight ahead.
[03:51:00.556 --> 03:51:01.037]  Stay with us.
[03:51:01.812 --> 03:51:05.373]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[03:51:05.373 --> 03:51:07.653]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[03:51:07.653 --> 03:51:08.513]  Don't!
[03:51:08.513 --> 03:51:11.954]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[03:51:11.954 --> 03:51:19.095]  Why pay, when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[03:51:19.075 --> 03:51:21.056]  's number one debt secret.
[03:51:21.056 --> 03:51:25.116]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[03:51:25.116 --> 03:51:27.817]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[03:51:28.257 --> 03:51:35.644]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[03:51:35.644 --> 03:51:36.825]  Herb K. was right.
[03:51:36.825 --> 03:51:40.008]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[03:51:40.008 --> 03:51:41.369]  What have you got to lose?
[03:51:41.369 --> 03:51:45.073]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money.
[03:51:45.073 --> 03:51:45.733]  Get Herb K.'
[03:51:45.693 --> 03:51:49.016]  's number one debt secret absolutely free now.
[03:51:49.016 --> 03:51:49.377]  Call 888-352-7726.
[03:51:53.450 --> 03:51:53.871]  That's 888-352-7726.
[03:51:53.871 --> 03:51:53.931]  888-352-7726.
[03:51:53.931 --> 03:51:56.794]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:51:56.794 --> 03:51:59.358]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:51:59.358 --> 03:52:03.263]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[03:52:12.412 --> 03:52:15.433]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:52:15.433 --> 03:52:21.474]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:52:21.474 --> 03:52:27.016]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:52:27.016 --> 03:52:36.658]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:52:36.778 --> 03:52:39.120]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:52:39.120 --> 03:52:40.701]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:52:40.701 --> 03:52:43.162]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:52:43.162 --> 03:52:45.284]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:52:45.284 --> 03:52:50.447]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[03:53:30.985 --> 03:53:40.311]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it lent back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[03:53:40.311 --> 03:53:47.376]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[03:53:47.376 --> 03:53:48.257]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[03:53:48.257 --> 03:53:51.499]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.

[03:54:04.467 --> 03:54:08.049]  Constitutional lawyer, Gary Fielder, is our guest.
[03:54:08.049 --> 03:54:17.254]  Final segment, retransmission with Bob Chapman, Jesse Ventura, and of course, yours truly, coming up on the InfoWars.com streams and on great AM and FM's everywhere.

[03:54:22.838 --> 03:54:24.058]  That's how we reach more people.
[03:54:24.058 --> 03:54:25.299]  That's activism right there.
[03:54:25.299 --> 03:54:30.482]  You see the police in all their royal uniforms, the government, the judges, they're telling you they're special.
[03:54:30.862 --> 03:54:32.463]  They're dressing like kings.
[03:54:32.463 --> 03:54:37.144]  They're wearing epaulets and jewels and signets of their power.
[03:54:37.144 --> 03:54:39.945]  But in America, the power flows from the people.
[03:54:39.945 --> 03:54:40.925]  We have to relearn that.
[03:54:40.925 --> 03:54:42.906]  Gary, we've got four minutes left.
[03:54:42.906 --> 03:54:44.507]  Other key points you want to make.
[03:54:44.507 --> 03:54:49.948]  And if folks can't make a seminar tomorrow in Austin, you can look on his website for other places he's having the seminars.
[03:54:49.948 --> 03:54:50.289]  Go ahead.
[03:54:50.289 --> 03:54:52.169]  Alright, thank you very much, Alex.
[03:54:52.169 --> 03:54:54.190]  Just a couple of final thoughts.
[03:54:54.190 --> 03:54:57.491]  From my opinion, it's unquestionable that after
[03:54:58.272 --> 03:55:23.210]  uh... the declaration of independence the people of the states were sovereign in each each state constitution when we sign the treaty of paris with ben franklin john jay and john adams the sovereignty of king george the third was bestowed upon the states and so we know we often think of each state being sovereign but as the constitution was drafted in a case very early on when john jay
[03:55:23.697 --> 03:55:28.098]  Who signed the Treaty of Paris was the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.
[03:55:28.098 --> 03:55:37.281]  He issued a ruling in Chisholm v. Georgia that said although the Treaty of Paris bestowed the sovereignty onto the quote-unquote states, the states are the people.
[03:55:37.281 --> 03:55:41.303]  So even our states don't hold the quote-unquote sovereignty.
[03:55:41.303 --> 03:55:42.023]  We do.
[03:55:42.023 --> 03:55:43.643]  Yeah, and that's a fact.
[03:55:43.643 --> 03:55:45.064]  I mean, we don't have a king here.
[03:55:45.064 --> 03:55:47.304]  We don't have a king, state, or federal.
[03:55:47.304 --> 03:55:48.085]  And it's in our blood.
[03:55:48.085 --> 03:55:51.886]  So when we look at the Constitution and we look at the Preamble, it's we the people
[03:55:52.726 --> 03:55:55.308]  Um, to ourselves and our posterity.
[03:55:55.308 --> 03:55:59.051]  So I'm not trying to limit sovereignty or who is in the people.
[03:55:59.051 --> 03:56:08.658]  But clearly, however you define the term posterity, if our relatives were on the land, we don't have to worry about who's sovereign and who's not sovereign.
[03:56:08.658 --> 03:56:10.180]  We definitely are.
[03:56:10.180 --> 03:56:13.262]  So instead of arguing about, you know, who's better or who's worse,
[03:56:13.860 --> 03:56:24.743]  I'm simply suggesting that if you know from tracing your family heritage that your family was on the land and they helped build this country, they were bestowed by the king.
[03:56:24.743 --> 03:56:26.484]  They have direct title.
[03:56:26.484 --> 03:56:27.304]  Sovereignty.
[03:56:27.304 --> 03:56:28.464]  Direct title.
[03:56:28.464 --> 03:56:32.846]  So it's not an exclusive game, it's an inclusive game.
[03:56:32.846 --> 03:56:37.187]  But if you were bestowed with that sovereignty, then you're going to have to miss some of those football games.
[03:56:37.187 --> 03:56:39.348]  You're going to have to miss some of those movies.
[03:56:39.348 --> 03:56:40.048]  It's time.
[03:56:40.048 --> 03:56:40.668]  It's time now.
[03:56:41.474 --> 03:56:42.395]  Everybody's getting called up.
[03:56:42.395 --> 03:56:43.756]  History is happening now!
[03:56:43.756 --> 03:56:44.737]  It's Minutemen time.
[03:56:44.737 --> 03:56:46.179]  It's Minutewomen time.
[03:56:46.179 --> 03:56:55.248]  And make no mistake about it, even the Supreme Court cases, which came up through the 18th century, were inclusive of women.
[03:56:55.248 --> 03:56:58.632]  Now, there are other issues that have to be resolved with regard to sovereignty.
[03:56:59.361 --> 03:57:01.542]  But that's on a more technical basis.
[03:57:01.542 --> 03:57:02.783]  People will learn more in the seminar.
[03:57:02.783 --> 03:57:06.684]  We're never going to have you back for an hour on the phone just on sovereignty.
[03:57:06.684 --> 03:57:08.065]  You wanted to talk about Obama briefly.
[03:57:08.065 --> 03:57:13.187]  Just briefly because part of the sovereignty is knowing who you are.
[03:57:13.187 --> 03:57:25.432]  And in the process of knowing who you are, you read a couple of cases about what the term quote-unquote citizen of the United States means and what the term natural-born citizen means.
[03:57:25.432 --> 03:57:26.833]  At the very limit
[03:57:27.580 --> 03:57:34.442]  A natural-born citizen is one who has at least both parents as United States citizens.
[03:57:34.442 --> 03:57:36.163]  Both parents could be naturalized.
[03:57:36.163 --> 03:57:38.383]  Both parents could be recent immigrants.
[03:57:38.383 --> 03:57:41.264]  But a natural-born citizen is one born on the land.
[03:57:41.264 --> 03:57:42.745]  So let's forget about the birth certificate.
[03:57:42.745 --> 03:57:44.285]  Let's forget about the Hawaii thing.
[03:57:44.285 --> 03:57:45.986]  And concede that.
[03:57:45.986 --> 03:57:47.646]  With two parents... That's right.
[03:57:47.646 --> 03:57:50.667]  We shouldn't have a president whose both parents weren't born here.
[03:57:50.667 --> 03:57:54.568]  At least both parents have to be naturalized or themselves natural-born.
[03:57:54.568 --> 03:57:56.809]  So with all due respect to Mr. Obama...
[03:57:57.389 --> 03:58:01.830]  He can't be the President of the United States because his father was a British citizen.
[03:58:01.830 --> 03:58:03.410]  Gary, you're a constitutional expert.
[03:58:03.410 --> 03:58:09.071]  I want to have you back on on that subject and your overview for a full hour over the phone in the next few weeks.
[03:58:09.071 --> 03:58:10.692]  That sounds really good, Alex, and thank you so much.
[03:58:10.692 --> 03:58:11.912]  In fact, the producers are out there.
[03:58:11.912 --> 03:58:14.332]  Before you leave us, we'll set it up.
[03:58:14.332 --> 03:58:17.353]  8.30 tomorrow, sign-in time at the, uh, what is it, AT&T?
[03:58:17.353 --> 03:58:19.414]  AT&T Event Center at the University of Texas.
[03:58:19.414 --> 03:58:21.394]  My proud alma mater, 1987.
[03:58:21.394 --> 03:58:22.954]  And fire up your website one more time.
[03:58:22.954 --> 03:58:25.995]  Gigasup.net and legalstatusareus.com.
[03:58:27.085 --> 03:58:28.006]  Gary, great having you in us.
[03:58:28.006 --> 03:58:28.486]  Thank you.
[03:58:28.486 --> 03:58:29.147]  Rave on, Alex.
[03:58:29.147 --> 03:58:29.987]  Rave on.
[03:58:29.987 --> 03:58:30.648]  Thank you.
[03:58:30.648 --> 03:58:30.888]  You bet.
[03:58:30.888 --> 03:58:31.848]  Great job, crew.
[03:58:31.848 --> 03:58:33.410]  Retransmission starts now.
[03:58:33.410 --> 03:58:34.370]  Have a great weekend.
[03:58:34.370 --> 03:58:36.072]  I'm gonna go in there and fight the New World Order.
[03:58:36.072 --> 03:58:40.475]  Two new films coming up, and one of them's already pre-selling at InfoWars.com.
[03:58:40.475 --> 03:58:44.117]  Invisible Empire.

[03:58:51.786 --> 03:58:53.087]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:58:53.087 --> 03:58:58.669]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[03:58:58.669 --> 03:59:03.691]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[03:59:03.691 --> 03:59:09.253]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[03:59:09.253 --> 03:59:11.094]  So our friends at Solutions from Science
[03:59:11.374 --> 03:59:11.855]  We're good to go.

[03:59:35.941 --> 03:59:39.382]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[03:59:39.382 --> 03:59:41.123]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
