[00:00.000 --> 00:14.960]  Do you think it's problematic to do business with the Communist Chinese party when they
[00:14.960 --> 00:16.720]  suppress human rights?
[00:16.720 --> 00:20.880]  Have you reached out to them as a matter of national security since we obviously have
[00:20.880 --> 00:25.280]  national security concerns with China who they seem to be aiding in this process?
[00:25.280 --> 00:26.280]  Sure.
[00:26.280 --> 00:29.120]  I don't have any communications to speak to specifically with Apple executives.
[00:29.120 --> 00:33.840]  So when I've told you over the decades that large multinational corporations allied the
[00:33.840 --> 00:39.680]  dictatorships of the UN run the leadership of the CIA, that's not my opinion.
[00:39.680 --> 00:44.960]  And now the Carnegie Endowment former head publicly runs it and it's come out in the
[00:44.960 --> 00:51.000]  news the last few months that the CIA specifically illegally with the Justice Department is meeting
[00:51.000 --> 00:57.500]  with Big Tech, corporate dinosaur legacy media and major corporations to set up a social
[00:57.500 --> 01:02.200]  credit score that's already being implemented by stealth to basically debank you, harass
[01:02.200 --> 01:05.440]  you and later imprison you if you don't go along with them.
[01:05.440 --> 01:08.920]  So this is a real detallotering and takeover.
[01:08.920 --> 01:14.840]  Our democracies on both sides of the ocean are being shaken by the same doubts as to
[01:14.840 --> 01:19.560]  our ability to be sufficiently strong and effective when it comes to the challenges
[01:19.560 --> 01:23.880]  we share hate speech, false information and today's fears.
[01:23.880 --> 01:32.520]  To me, the best way to counter the dissemination of misinformation, we've got to be out there.
[01:32.520 --> 01:39.280]  People who you trust, who are trusted messengers to get out there and put the truth out.
[01:39.280 --> 01:43.840]  I don't usually read from a prepared speech, but this is so important that I wanted to
[01:43.840 --> 01:50.240]  make sure that I got every single word and fact, scientific fact, correct.
[01:50.240 --> 01:54.880]  Before you inject your child, a decision that is irreversible.
[01:54.880 --> 01:59.720]  I wanted to let you know the scientific facts about this genetic vaccine, which is based
[01:59.720 --> 02:03.000]  on the RNA vaccine technology I created.
[02:03.000 --> 02:08.160]  The first is that a viral gene will be injected into your parent's cells.
[02:08.160 --> 02:13.680]  This gene forces your child's body to make toxic spike proteins.
[02:13.680 --> 02:20.840]  It just seems to me, I didn't do a study on it, but from what I'm seeing from my experience
[02:20.840 --> 02:27.720]  is that the people who are spreading misinformation and disinformation seem to be relentless in
[02:27.720 --> 02:30.720]  their pursuit of spreading misinformation.
[02:30.720 --> 02:36.080]  And if you watch corporate media, you'll see a CIA analyst saying, screw your free speech.
[02:36.080 --> 02:37.080]  It doesn't exist.
[02:37.080 --> 02:40.320]  Elon Musk is allowing some freedom on Twitter as a Russian agent.
[02:40.320 --> 02:46.400]  Putin is going to be all over Twitter, if there's no regulations on this, fake accounts,
[02:46.400 --> 02:51.480]  spoofed accounts, the rest of it, this is a great opportunity for him.
[02:51.480 --> 02:55.320]  And so when he's talking about the popular voice, Musk, he's really talking about Russian
[02:55.320 --> 02:56.320]  intelligence.
[02:56.320 --> 03:01.440]  Controlling what we can say is a means of controlling what we think.
[03:01.440 --> 03:05.920]  Anyone who doesn't understand the importance of protecting all speech, including speech
[03:05.920 --> 03:09.560]  we find reprehensible, is an enemy of America.
[03:09.560 --> 03:13.800]  Do you think that users have a right to freedom of speech, even if what they're saying is
[03:13.800 --> 03:15.240]  wrong or offensive?
[03:15.240 --> 03:22.120]  I think that one human being should not decide how millions of people communicate with each
[03:22.120 --> 03:23.120]  other.
[03:23.120 --> 03:28.280]  One human being should not be able to go into a dark room by himself and decide, oh, that
[03:28.280 --> 03:31.120]  person gets heard from, that person doesn't.
[03:31.120 --> 03:32.760]  That's not how it should work.
[03:32.760 --> 03:37.360]  It says Twitter provides a global communication platform which encompasses a variety of users
[03:37.360 --> 03:40.060]  with different voices, ideas, and perspectives.
[03:40.060 --> 03:45.760]  As a policy, we do not mediate content or intervene in disputes between users.
[03:45.760 --> 03:47.920]  This is all just the First Amendment law.
[03:47.920 --> 03:52.120]  And they say down here, if you believe content or behavior you're reporting is prohibited
[03:52.120 --> 03:55.520]  in your local jurisdiction, please contact your local authorities.
[03:55.520 --> 04:01.120]  This is the sleight of hand that the establishment has done, is they've equated free speech with
[04:01.120 --> 04:03.000]  hate speech.
[04:03.000 --> 04:08.320]  So if you're for free speech, you're against minority groups because then people will be
[04:08.320 --> 04:10.960]  able to hurl hate speech at them.
[04:10.960 --> 04:15.760]  And so you should be against free speech because it hurts minority groups.
[04:15.760 --> 04:20.080]  The only thing minority groups have is their speech.
[04:20.080 --> 04:21.080]  Words can be weapons.
[04:21.080 --> 04:24.880]  Hate speech online can lead to cruelty and violence in real life.
[04:24.880 --> 04:29.920]  The UN report says ban people's speech because it might make somebody do something bad when
[04:29.920 --> 04:34.320]  they flood our countries with third world populations filled with hate for us if you
[04:34.320 --> 04:36.440]  criticize it, you get arrested.
[04:36.440 --> 04:41.680]  Markets like actually totalitarian governments where you have a understanding of what's out
[04:41.680 --> 04:47.160]  there and obviously the whole dimension is changing now with, as you said, a democratization
[04:47.160 --> 04:49.600]  of countries.
[04:49.600 --> 04:54.600]  And democracies are very messy, as we know in the United States, you have opinions changing.
[04:54.600 --> 04:57.600]  So this is the control, ladies and gentlemen.
[04:57.600 --> 05:00.920]  This is their, this is their larger plan.
[05:00.920 --> 05:06.960]  December 2022 is here and we are proud and very excited to announce that free shipping
[05:06.960 --> 05:09.880]  is back at infowarstore.com.
[05:09.880 --> 05:13.720]  That's right, free shipping on all orders of $50 or more.
[05:13.720 --> 05:19.200]  But we've signed a new deal with a big national shipping company and they're able to cut
[05:19.200 --> 05:22.720]  our regular shipping cost by up to 50%.
[05:22.720 --> 05:27.240]  So that means even on orders that are below $50, you're going to be paying way lower than
[05:27.240 --> 05:28.960]  you were previously.
[05:28.960 --> 05:31.880]  This is a game changer, we're so excited about it.
[05:31.880 --> 05:35.600]  Our listeners have really asked for free shipping again, we couldn't afford it before, but by
[05:35.600 --> 05:38.600]  moving to a bigger national distributor, we're able to do it.
[05:38.600 --> 05:44.160]  So now your orders will be shipped even faster, the same great customer service and more.
[05:44.160 --> 05:50.200]  So get huge discounts and free shipping on so many great items at infowarstore.com right
[05:50.200 --> 05:51.200]  now.
[05:51.200 --> 05:54.240]  I want to thank you all for your support, but now there's no excuse to boost your immune
[05:54.240 --> 06:01.240]  system, lead a healthier life, and keep invoices on the air at infowarstore.com.
[06:24.240 --> 06:45.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live on December 4th, Sunday edition.
[06:45.080 --> 06:49.360]  I'm your host Alex Jones, we're going to be here tonight until 8 p.m. central, we just
[06:49.360 --> 06:53.760]  kicked off at 4 p.m. central broadcasting worldwide.
[06:53.760 --> 06:58.200]  We're also here weekdays 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. central with my show, then we have the other
[06:58.200 --> 06:59.800]  great infowar shows.
[06:59.800 --> 07:04.360]  All the new listeners tuning in from the Kanye West, yay interview Thursday, millions and
[07:04.360 --> 07:08.840]  millions of new listeners need to bookmark it, no, you're going to get a lot of forbidden
[07:08.840 --> 07:12.600]  information that some very bad people do not want you to know.
[07:12.600 --> 07:15.760]  They are the globalists, they are the new world order, we name them, we show you their
[07:15.760 --> 07:22.400]  documents, their own statements, and when we make claims, we prove it here unlike them.
[07:22.400 --> 07:31.680]  Okay, the Twitter files being released the first of over 20 tranches of information by
[07:31.680 --> 07:35.720]  Elon Musk, the new owner of Twitter, is bringing the deep state to its knees, showing illegal
[07:35.720 --> 07:41.640]  election collusion and mass censorship from everybody from James Woods to Donald Trump
[07:41.640 --> 07:46.520]  to Alex Jones to Tucker Carlson on Twitter, and hundreds of thousands of other prominent
[07:46.520 --> 07:48.280]  people.
[07:48.280 --> 07:50.040]  That's a massive story.
[07:50.040 --> 07:55.240]  We've also got the huge fallout of the yay interview where he was openly testing First
[07:55.240 --> 07:59.680]  Amendment and provocaturing the public, I'll give you some of the inside baseball on why
[07:59.680 --> 08:02.440]  he did what he did, I didn't know he would do it until he did it.
[08:02.440 --> 08:06.040]  I thought he was coming to talk about love and coming together and we're going to get
[08:06.040 --> 08:11.400]  into those other issues, I said he could if he wanted to, but he wasn't, he did.
[08:11.400 --> 08:14.520]  Now I've got the inside scoop on why he did what he did, we're going to be talking about
[08:14.520 --> 08:23.600]  it with a special guest, I'll leave it at that, coming up in the second hour today.
[08:23.600 --> 08:24.600]  That's a huge area.
[08:24.600 --> 08:35.560]  We also have open hardcore Nazi rituals, this is real Nazis, not yay trolling, in Ukraine
[08:35.560 --> 08:40.240]  backed by the government officially with the Azog battalions where they howl Hitler on
[08:40.240 --> 08:47.880]  video and do blood rituals that Hitler invented called blood and soil, this is a Nazi ritual,
[08:47.880 --> 08:51.640]  see them see highling, we'll show you close ups with swastikas on their arms.
[08:51.640 --> 08:55.480]  This is the main military of Ukraine, I'll explain exactly what's going on, Zelensky
[08:55.480 --> 08:59.520]  just banned the second largest church that founded Ukraine a thousand years ago, the
[08:59.520 --> 09:05.880]  Orthodox church is banned in Ukraine, arguably the largest church, you could argue the Catholic
[09:05.880 --> 09:10.360]  church is the biggest, those two groups have fought with each other for a thousand years,
[09:10.360 --> 09:14.840]  but they got together to defeat the Muslims and others that invaded over the last thousand,
[09:14.840 --> 09:20.280]  but now they're back fighting again, Hitler exacerbated the two sides in World War II
[09:20.280 --> 09:25.840]  as a proxy war, right back to where we were 75 years ago at the end of World War II.
[09:25.840 --> 09:31.120]  That's all coming up, we have got huge news on the globalists trying to turn off the
[09:31.120 --> 09:35.160]  energy supplies and what's really happening with the economy and inflation and what the
[09:35.160 --> 09:39.840]  numbers say for next year with inflation, this is going to be a very important broadcast,
[09:39.840 --> 09:46.040]  I've over prepared, it's almost shameful how much I've prepared since Friday evening,
[09:46.040 --> 09:50.240]  probably 15 hours, should have spent time with my family more, but I've spent 15 hours
[09:50.240 --> 09:54.240]  at least in deep study and a lot of what I don't get to today we'll cover on the Monday
[09:54.240 --> 10:01.600]  show tomorrow, but we've just got the waterfront here, all of this is massive, Elon Musk has
[10:01.600 --> 10:06.960]  said he's not suicidal, he's gotten more security because of what he's about to release on the
[10:06.960 --> 10:13.800]  deep state, I believe him, this is very dangerous bombshell stuff, I said on Friday when one
[10:13.800 --> 10:18.400]  of my associates was about to talk to Elon Musk in a few minutes that you better warn
[10:18.400 --> 10:21.920]  him they're going to try to kill him, you better get more security, you better really
[10:21.920 --> 10:25.440]  have his private jets checked, I'm not saying I spurred him to make the announcement, but
[10:25.440 --> 10:32.440]  hours after I told him that through the closest associate of his, he did indeed come out and
[10:32.440 --> 10:37.360]  say that, I was also sent a recording that's not been picked up in the press that was in
[10:37.360 --> 10:44.560]  an online group chat that Musk was in yesterday, will be airing, no one's broken this, I thought
[10:44.560 --> 10:49.000]  as soon as he said it because I was sent the live feed, only had about 50 people on it,
[10:49.000 --> 10:53.440]  that someone would put it out, when I noticed it didn't come out a few hours later, I went
[10:53.440 --> 10:58.600]  and grabbed the clip, Jamie White posted it in FullWars.com, Musk talks about how he wanted
[10:58.600 --> 11:05.320]  to punch, yay in the face, only a two minute clip out of an hour plus long audio chat with
[11:05.320 --> 11:10.880]  the Musk, again the whole thing was newsworthy, but mainstream journalists don't actually
[11:10.880 --> 11:16.240]  do journalist work like sit and listen to a private chat that I got an invite to, that's
[11:16.240 --> 11:19.480]  again public, you got to get an invite, and I was sitting there listening to this, it
[11:19.480 --> 11:23.320]  was amazing, Mark Dice was in the chat as well, he was listening to it, he was blowing
[11:23.320 --> 11:28.280]  away, so he reported on some of it, but it's not broken, he said he wants to punch, yay
[11:28.280 --> 11:31.800]  in the face, but that's not the bigger issue, the bigger issue is he says, well Alex Jones
[11:31.800 --> 11:38.360]  is kind of edgy, but at least he tried to reel in and rein in, yay a little bit, so
[11:38.360 --> 11:44.560]  why am I still banned, and we'll elaborate on all of that, so these are all huge issues,
[11:44.560 --> 11:49.240]  I mean this is just so much breaking news, it'll make your head spin, and I know our
[11:49.240 --> 11:55.160]  general audience of about 3 million people at infowars.com and on our radio stations
[11:55.160 --> 12:00.320]  conservatively tune in our regular 3 million people every day, and then a lot of people
[12:00.320 --> 12:03.560]  tune in once a week, that's another 5 or 6 million, and then other folks pick up our
[12:03.560 --> 12:08.200]  viral clips, that's probably 50 to 100 million a week, but those aren't regular listeners,
[12:08.200 --> 12:11.480]  we have the numbers, it's been all the news, even NBC News reports it's the biggest media
[12:11.480 --> 12:17.720]  event in weeks, over 100 million people have tuned in since Thursday to infowars.com, our
[12:17.720 --> 12:23.320]  streams and our videos, over 100 million, and we have millions and millions, we have
[12:23.320 --> 12:28.320]  over 10 million new listeners on Friday alone tune in and millions extra tuning in tonight,
[12:28.320 --> 12:32.040]  so our regular listeners already pretty much know what I'm about to cover when we come
[12:32.040 --> 12:37.240]  back, but the millions of new people tuning in don't, and they've got Washington Post,
[12:37.240 --> 12:43.760]  NBC News, literally hundreds of articles, I can't even read them all, lamenting that
[12:43.760 --> 12:50.280]  okay, Jones is right back where he was before his deplatforming right when Trump won 6 years
[12:50.280 --> 12:56.960]  ago with 100 million people tuning in, so we're right back at the top, and so even though
[12:56.960 --> 13:02.360]  I don't agree with a lot of what Ye had to say, he did kind of sneak attack me with that,
[13:02.360 --> 13:06.520]  I don't think, I don't think he did it for bad, he did it to cause a massive debate
[13:06.520 --> 13:11.200]  and try to bring down the system, and I think a lot of people figure that out, he's trying
[13:11.200 --> 13:15.600]  to culture jam, regardless God is going to use all that for good, so we have millions
[13:15.600 --> 13:18.560]  and millions and millions and millions and millions and millions of new people tuning
[13:18.560 --> 13:23.720]  in right now, I want to encourage you to check out all the claims I make, do your own research,
[13:23.720 --> 13:27.400]  write down notes about what I cover, notice we actually show you clips and documents for
[13:27.400 --> 13:31.400]  everything we talk about, everything I just mentioned is going to be played here on air
[13:31.400 --> 13:39.880]  today, the next four hours, and then when you find out we're telling you the truth,
[13:39.880 --> 13:45.600]  share infowars.com, infowars.com, to find out all the audio and video feeds, and band
[13:45.600 --> 13:50.080]  dot video to find out the live feeds and the archives, not just to myself, but hundreds
[13:50.080 --> 13:59.040]  of other providers, conservative, liberal, Christian, anti-war, gay, straight, if you're
[13:59.040 --> 14:03.000]  a censored group that's been attacked and you're not doing anything criminal and you
[14:03.000 --> 14:07.600]  approach us and we vet that you're not doing anything criminal, then you get a channel
[14:07.600 --> 14:12.720]  on band dot video, there's over 500 contributors now, so it's not just me, it's all the black
[14:12.720 --> 14:19.440]  sheep and the folks that people don't want, the folks the establishment doesn't want
[14:19.440 --> 14:29.040]  heard, they're all at band dot video, and my only regret was when yay was on and we
[14:29.040 --> 14:32.600]  had while he was on for three hours, over 40 million people listening, just during that
[14:32.600 --> 14:38.520]  live show, I didn't promote infowars.com more, band dot video more, I didn't put more graphics
[14:38.520 --> 14:45.920]  up for infowarsstore.com because we need to fund our operation and the last four or five
[14:45.920 --> 14:51.640]  days is going to cost us $300,000, $400,000 in bandwidth, I mean when you've got 100 million
[14:51.640 --> 14:57.280]  people coming into your site and tens of millions clicking audio and video, I mean one video
[14:57.280 --> 15:02.720]  we've got has got 5 million views, even though we've got good prices on bandwidth, it is going
[15:02.720 --> 15:08.440]  to be astronomical and it did not convert Thursday and Friday to money, in fact it was
[15:08.440 --> 15:15.160]  all new listeners, orders in the store infowars.com actually went way down, so it's a paradox, so
[15:15.160 --> 15:20.440]  there's nothing like this out there anywhere, infowars.com is amazing, infowarsstore.com
[15:20.440 --> 15:24.240]  is what powers it and the products, they're amazing, but the biggest sales of the year
[15:24.240 --> 15:28.640]  going right now and free shipping is back on orders $50 or more, the regular shipping
[15:28.640 --> 15:32.760]  prices gone way down as well, we've got a new big company to handle it all, so if you
[15:32.760 --> 15:37.240]  want great products, particularly the supplements like DNA Force Plus, vitamin mineral fusion,

[17:00.440 --> 17:06.960]  In Arizona, I think we watched the election be stolen, slowly stolen, day by day counting
[17:06.960 --> 17:13.760]  these mail-in ballots and it's absolutely absurd for anyone to take our election seriously
[17:13.760 --> 17:20.000]  when we just, it's election month, Alex, it's not election day and that's the problem
[17:20.000 --> 17:26.960]  and everything changed after COVID-19, they illegally changed state elections, mailing
[17:26.960 --> 17:31.960]  ballots to anyone and everyone and sometimes mailing multiple ballots to people.
[17:31.960 --> 17:36.560]  Well, this isn't any way to run an election, we're in a serious country when we have elections
[17:36.560 --> 17:41.120]  that can be stolen like this and I believe that just like I believe the election was
[17:41.120 --> 17:46.800]  stolen in 2020 and I have no problem saying that and it is so absurd for the media and
[17:46.800 --> 17:52.920]  the Democrats to attack us that question our election integrity and question the fact that
[17:52.920 --> 17:56.520]  elections shouldn't be run the way they are.
[17:56.520 --> 18:00.560]  We're not election deniers, we're election realists.
[18:00.560 --> 18:06.560]  Let's say tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be
[18:06.560 --> 18:11.760]  allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[18:11.760 --> 18:15.600]  The First Amendment is unique in the world, that's what they want to take away, your ability
[18:15.600 --> 18:16.600]  to speak freely.
[18:16.600 --> 18:19.840]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next, or they're going to go for Steve Bannon or
[18:19.840 --> 18:21.320]  they're going to go for Tucker Carlson.
[18:21.320 --> 18:25.440]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago, but only 28 years and I knew they were planning
[18:25.440 --> 18:29.760]  all of this and I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere but I couldn't have done it without
[18:29.760 --> 18:30.760]  your support.
[18:30.760 --> 18:34.800]  And now because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, not just America,
[18:34.800 --> 18:38.360]  we're public enemy number one when it comes to globalist agenda.
[18:38.360 --> 18:42.000]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful Info Wars has been
[18:42.000 --> 18:43.680]  because of your past support.
[18:43.680 --> 18:47.480]  So I salute you and I thank you and I ask you now, the critical juncture of the battle,
[18:47.480 --> 18:51.920]  free double your efforts of visiting infowarstore.com and getting amazing products that keep us
[18:51.920 --> 18:52.920]  on air.

[19:00.320 --> 19:05.680]  The tip of the spear throughout this entire process, the only thing that made any Republican
[19:05.680 --> 19:10.760]  victories tonight possible, the only thing that made any resistance to the war machine
[19:10.760 --> 19:16.280]  possible, the only thing that made any opposition to the lockdowns and the mask mandates and
[19:16.280 --> 19:22.080]  the school shutdowns and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible, made any
[19:22.080 --> 19:27.760]  resistance to it possible was people continuing to support Info Wars, despite the massive
[19:27.760 --> 19:33.680]  lawfare being waged against Info Wars, despite the media defamatory libelist campaign against
[19:33.680 --> 19:38.920]  Info Wars, the ordinary people, the everyday people that buy products that make their own
[19:38.920 --> 19:44.400]  lives healthier, wealthier and wiser is what keeps Info Wars on the air and what that does
[19:44.400 --> 19:49.960]  is keep the populist message alive in an era and an age of totalitarian oppression.
[19:49.960 --> 19:56.080]  So continue to do it, go to places like infowarstore.com, go to the places like Save Info Wars, continue
[19:56.080 --> 20:01.800]  to keep Info Wars alive because in the process you're keeping American liberty alive.
[20:01.800 --> 20:11.800]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:11.800 --> 20:22.880]  Alright, last segment I told you, the waterfront and a boil down and a prelude to what's coming
[20:22.880 --> 20:23.880]  up.
[20:23.880 --> 20:28.160]  But down the drill end too, with all this huge news, what is the biggest news and what
[20:28.160 --> 20:31.120]  have I not covered yet?
[20:31.120 --> 20:35.080]  Now I know for our regular listeners, you already know all this, you've seen scientists,
[20:35.080 --> 20:38.840]  top doctors, you heard us two and a half, almost three years ago layout, what was going
[20:38.840 --> 20:42.600]  to happen is we have the Global of Stone documents.
[20:42.600 --> 20:47.160]  They came out on ABC News and said, oh now you're going to take six COVID shots a year.
[20:47.160 --> 20:49.160]  The White House announced that on Thursday.
[20:49.160 --> 20:52.960]  How do we say six COVID shots two and a half years ago?
[20:52.960 --> 20:56.840]  Because Bill Gates said to his investors that this shot gets rid of your immune system and
[20:56.840 --> 20:59.200]  people will have to take six of them to eight of them a year.
[20:59.200 --> 21:02.640]  I mean, I didn't just imagine that, he said it.
[21:02.640 --> 21:07.000]  I've played the clips many times, we even went on NBC News and said it.
[21:07.000 --> 21:10.000]  We only need boosters every few months.
[21:10.000 --> 21:13.520]  So when I tell you this stuff, understand it's real.
[21:13.520 --> 21:19.000]  Now a lot of people want to forget the lockdowns, forget the masks, forget the checkpoints,
[21:19.000 --> 21:25.200]  forget all the garbage that's ongoing in places like China and New Zealand and areas of Europe.
[21:25.200 --> 21:27.800]  But the globalists admit they plan to bring it back everywhere.
[21:27.800 --> 21:31.080]  So we got to get ahead of this and keep discrediting it.
[21:31.080 --> 21:36.640]  Our whole future to stop the UN, world government takeover is exposed where COVID came from,
[21:36.640 --> 21:39.520]  what the shots really do.
[21:39.520 --> 21:41.360]  If we don't, China is our future.
[21:41.360 --> 21:43.600]  So let's get into it.
[21:43.600 --> 21:54.760]  This is so huge in Israel, in Germany, in Japan, in the UK, in Canada, in the US, all
[21:54.760 --> 21:59.200]  over the world, in South Africa, and I have the articles and videos right here.
[21:59.200 --> 22:01.280]  We'll play a few of them.
[22:01.280 --> 22:02.280]  Take hours to play them all.
[22:02.280 --> 22:04.440]  I'll play a few.
[22:04.440 --> 22:09.040]  You have the government boards, you have the most prestigious universities assigned to
[22:09.040 --> 22:14.640]  research it saying the shots don't work, they erase your immune system, and they give you
[22:14.640 --> 22:19.040]  blood clots and infertility, and then the top Japanese doctor that runs the science
[22:19.040 --> 22:23.160]  department at one of their major universities in a government board meeting says, and they
[22:23.160 --> 22:29.880]  are all nodding their heads in Japan, that this is basically depopulation, and that they're
[22:29.880 --> 22:34.720]  going into the next phase of the diagnosis, and then it gets worse after the blood clots
[22:34.720 --> 22:36.760]  for those that even live.
[22:36.760 --> 22:43.480]  Okay, and the chief scientist, the chief professor starts cussing, and that's very rare in Japan,
[22:43.480 --> 22:48.880]  and saying to the government official over the new whitewash program, you're going to
[22:48.880 --> 22:52.880]  go to jail for what you've done if you don't stop this now, and that the scientists worldwide
[22:52.880 --> 22:55.160]  know what's happening.
[22:55.160 --> 22:58.480]  Now, it gets more important.
[22:58.480 --> 23:05.760]  Rand Paul comes out last Thursday night, and he says, Fauci's going to go to jail, Fauci
[23:05.760 --> 23:10.960]  created COVID, and the shots are deadly, and he's going to go to jail for what he did.
[23:10.960 --> 23:14.200]  He quote, will not get away, we caught him red-handed.
[23:14.200 --> 23:17.960]  I played the clip Friday, that video's on infowars.com, you want to see it.
[23:17.960 --> 23:21.480]  See, unlike corporate media, I actually show you something, I don't just tell you, it's
[23:21.480 --> 23:22.480]  there.
[23:22.480 --> 23:23.480]  Now, here's the next clip.
[23:23.480 --> 23:27.040]  It's on infowars.com right now, it needs to go viral.
[23:27.040 --> 23:33.360]  This expert blasts Japan's Ministry of Health, halt vaccine campaign and investigate all
[23:33.360 --> 23:38.520]  vaccine injuries, says Japan Ministry of Health was taken to the woodshed, their spokesperson,
[23:38.520 --> 23:42.840]  for refusing to halt the COVID vaccine rollout, it was called upon to further investigate the
[23:42.840 --> 23:50.160]  many documented adverse reactions and death, and that's Professor Masanori Fukushima, Professor
[23:50.160 --> 23:56.720]  Emeritus Kyoto University, in a government meeting with the government officials there,
[23:56.720 --> 24:01.080]  in the head of the vaccine research program, and he says, you're not going on, the data
[24:01.080 --> 24:06.320]  you're putting out whitewashes, now why is that important?
[24:06.320 --> 24:15.800]  I came across this weekend, 10 mainstream news articles in Europe, in Japan, in Singapore,
[24:15.800 --> 24:19.360]  in the US and Canada, where the same thing's being reported, look at this, there's video
[24:19.360 --> 24:24.240]  of this, look at this, the Ministry of Health in Israel is actively hiding critical information
[24:24.240 --> 24:28.480]  on the side effects to the Israeli public and lying about it while they have the actual
[24:28.480 --> 24:34.040]  data stored and know it's caused mass death, blood clots, you name it, and destroys immunity.
[24:34.040 --> 24:38.560]  I'm showing you the video, I'm showing you the research on screen for TV viewers, leaked
[24:38.560 --> 24:45.000]  video, world misled by falsified data, whole nother breakdown of that.
[24:45.000 --> 24:49.880]  So that's why this is so important is, this is coming out everywhere, you idiot, Dr. Fukushima
[24:49.880 --> 24:56.920]  calls the Ministry of Health Director a criminal to his face, here it is, Moderna vaccine injuries,
[24:56.920 --> 25:03.800]  six people in hours at a vaccine center, that's NBC News reporting that, I'm going to play
[25:03.800 --> 25:10.480]  that for you too, but it's a local NBC, and it goes on and on, scientists who worked at
[25:10.480 --> 25:14.600]  Wuhan blows the whistle, says they deliberately made the virus at the lab, we already know
[25:14.600 --> 25:19.280]  that in the emails, but that's New York Post.
[25:19.280 --> 25:24.320]  A hero nurse in Germany was allowed to walk free after allegedly injecting 10,000 people
[25:24.320 --> 25:27.960]  with salt water instead of the deadly shot, well yeah, if you worked in Joseph Mingle's
[25:27.960 --> 25:32.160]  lab telling people with experimental shots, wouldn't you be a hero to do that?
[25:32.160 --> 25:35.760]  It's like Schindler's List, it goes on and on and on.
[25:35.760 --> 25:43.240]  So let's play this first clip, the full thing is on infowars.com, this is Kyoto University
[25:43.240 --> 25:48.160]  Professor Fukushima to the government's face, we stop the vaccine rollout and investigate
[25:48.160 --> 25:53.000]  all the cases, you have asked so many people, yet less than 10% of the government will take
[25:53.000 --> 25:57.120]  it, just like here they won't take it, the government exempts itself from it, unless
[25:57.120 --> 25:59.800]  it's the military, here's the clip.
[25:59.800 --> 26:04.400]  So I am telling you, you got to conduct an investigation, no doctor can make a medical
[26:04.400 --> 26:08.920]  diagnosis simply by looking at such a piece of paper, I'm saying that you must look at
[26:08.920 --> 26:14.120]  the medical reports and do a proper investigation, there's no question about it, stop the bad
[26:14.120 --> 26:18.560]  science and do the right science, that's enough, looks like you're trying to destroy
[26:18.560 --> 26:22.760]  evidence, do the right thing, or you're just going to have a criminal lawsuit, enough is
[26:22.760 --> 26:25.280]  enough.
[26:25.280 --> 26:30.520]  I don't care what you say, no one is going to be convinced by the process or bullsh**t
[26:30.520 --> 26:32.520]  things that you are talking about.
[26:32.520 --> 26:37.920]  Well of course, we will not only evaluate the results as they are, we are trying.
[26:37.920 --> 26:41.440]  You can't possibly have any way to evaluate it.
[26:41.440 --> 26:45.960]  What you need, clinically speaking, is that you need to look at the medical records properly,
[26:45.960 --> 26:50.840]  look at the data, and do it properly and carefully, one case at a time.
[26:50.840 --> 26:52.440]  People's lives are at stake.
[26:52.440 --> 26:55.400]  Yes sir, we will make every effort to do so.
[26:55.400 --> 26:57.280]  You idiot.
[26:57.280 --> 27:02.160]  Enough is enough, you have so many people here, but you are not getting anywhere, lawmakers
[27:02.160 --> 27:05.920]  also came all the way here, you can't repeat this kind of thing.
[27:05.920 --> 27:10.600]  You should have started from the beginning with the proper scientific light, so immediately
[27:10.600 --> 27:16.280]  disband the ridiculous vaccine casualty evaluation committee, instead set up an investigation
[27:16.280 --> 27:21.360]  committee to investigate all cases, and to do so, you need to get proper statisticians
[27:21.360 --> 27:23.200]  and some decent experts.
[27:23.200 --> 27:27.480]  You understand, then do some tests and investigations, as doctor.
[27:27.480 --> 27:33.200]  Sono said earlier, if you have samples of tissue, consider the process of spiked protein.
[27:33.200 --> 27:38.160]  People are already doing research all over the world, Japan's prestige is at stake.
[27:38.160 --> 27:43.280]  You have vaccinated so many people, and yet, only 10% of the members of the Ministry of
[27:43.280 --> 27:47.920]  Health, Labor and Welfare who are leading the vaccine campaign have been vaccinated.
[27:47.920 --> 27:52.680]  With the f***ing joke is that, first of all, you need to clarify this, immediately disband
[27:52.680 --> 27:57.000]  the vaccine casualty evaluation committee and investigate all the cases.
[27:57.000 --> 28:01.720]  You must identify all deaths and unreported deaths in the investigation, thousands and
[28:01.720 --> 28:04.600]  tens of thousands of lives are at stake.
[28:04.600 --> 28:09.440]  And one more thing, we don't have any idea of the long term side effects of this vaccine.
[28:09.440 --> 28:14.840]  The nanoparticles, taken into the body, in large quantity, unceasingly produced by proteins.
[28:14.840 --> 28:17.760]  People are still sick, still in bad physical condition.
[28:17.760 --> 28:20.840]  For some reason, suddenly people's blood pressure rises.
[28:20.840 --> 28:23.600]  For some reason, people suddenly get eczema.
[28:23.600 --> 28:26.200]  When we diagnose, we find spiked protein.
[28:26.200 --> 28:28.840]  In the diagnosis is moving to the next phase.
[28:28.840 --> 28:32.920]  We need to stop vaccinating immediately and take care of the health of all cases.
[28:32.920 --> 28:35.280]  That's what the scientific paper also says.
[28:35.280 --> 28:39.280]  You bring in people who don't have a proper understanding of the cutting edge of science
[28:39.280 --> 28:40.280]  and...
[28:40.280 --> 28:44.120]  The disease expert blasts Japan's Ministry of Health to their face, halt vaccine campaign
[28:44.120 --> 28:45.720]  and investigate all vaccine injuries.
[28:45.720 --> 28:51.400]  And all the other scientists agree, the lies coming down, Fauci, Bill Gates, Klaus Schwab
[28:51.400 --> 28:55.960]  are real Nazis 2.0 and they're going to be defeated.
[28:55.960 --> 29:00.520]  The world's waking up, stay with us.
[29:00.520 --> 29:06.560]  December 2022 is here and we are proud and very excited to announce that free shipping

[30:28.280 --> 30:30.440]  You ever seen fish oil look like that?
[30:30.440 --> 30:32.520]  No, you never seen that, have you?
[30:32.520 --> 30:43.000]  And this little jewel right here is solid, liquid consciousness.
[30:43.000 --> 30:50.440]  Look it up, find out how even the FDA and the government admits fish oil is incredible.

[31:55.080 --> 32:00.240]  You can get started today and on a pathway to better health.
[32:00.240 --> 32:07.000]  Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world believe that people got sick and
[32:07.000 --> 32:11.560]  died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors.
[32:11.560 --> 32:16.000]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather.
[32:16.000 --> 32:20.840]  Of course it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people, what was killing
[32:20.840 --> 32:24.440]  people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[32:24.440 --> 32:31.240]  You see the sun via your skin helps your body produce vitamin D3, but if you're not getting
[32:31.240 --> 32:36.320]  enough sun, you will not produce vitamin D3 and then it's very easy for viruses and other
[32:36.320 --> 32:39.120]  things to start replicating and taking your body over.
[32:39.120 --> 32:43.080]  So now it's more important than ever because the winter is here to take high quality vitamin
[32:43.080 --> 32:47.840]  D3 and we have the best with our vitamin D3 gummies with calcium for better upload in

[33:33.320 --> 33:34.320]  your prayer.

[33:35.320 --> 33:39.120]  You are the reason we're so successful and have a fighting chance together.
[33:39.120 --> 33:40.120]  All right.
[33:40.120 --> 33:46.320]  This segment I'm going to finish up with the incredible COVID being produced in a lab,
[33:46.320 --> 33:49.520]  the vaccine not being a vaccine destroying your immune system giving you all these health
[33:49.520 --> 33:50.520]  problems.
[33:50.520 --> 33:54.480]  Just like the CDC document in October of 2000 predicted it would because they were covering
[33:54.480 --> 33:58.120]  their ass up front as a scientist knew what it was going to do, they already done mouse
[33:58.120 --> 34:00.840]  studies with the same injections.
[34:00.840 --> 34:06.120]  But it's played you a major governmental university meeting with the head of the Ministry
[34:06.120 --> 34:09.880]  of Health and all of it being escorriated by scientists and it's not just this chief
[34:09.880 --> 34:10.880]  scientist.
[34:10.880 --> 34:12.760]  It goes on for hours.
[34:12.760 --> 34:17.240]  They literally annihilate him and expose it all.
[34:17.240 --> 34:24.360]  It's up on infowarstore.com and I have similar clubs out of Israel, Singapore, Germany, France,
[34:24.360 --> 34:26.360]  Canada, Australia.
[34:26.360 --> 34:30.560]  It's all coming out, ladies and gentlemen.
[34:30.560 --> 34:31.800]  It's all coming out.
[34:31.800 --> 34:34.480]  Now, I've told everybody this a thousand times.
[34:34.480 --> 34:36.160]  We've studied it in depth.
[34:36.160 --> 34:39.400]  Don't take any of these so-called COVID shots.
[34:39.400 --> 34:41.760]  These mRNA injections are the virus vectors.
[34:41.760 --> 34:42.760]  They do the same thing.
[34:42.760 --> 34:46.120]  Send a virus in to order yourselves to produce a spike protein.
[34:46.120 --> 34:49.960]  They were told by Gates and Fauci and Peter Dazik what to create, they got four companies
[34:49.960 --> 34:50.960]  to do it.
[34:50.960 --> 34:54.720]  China and a bunch of other countries refuse to take our shot but here they've tried to
[34:54.720 --> 34:59.920]  force it and they are forcing our military criminally as Senator Rand Paul is exposed
[34:59.920 --> 35:03.680]  and is fighting.
[35:03.680 --> 35:08.360]  But if you are going to take one of the shots, understand hands down, we've got all the numbers
[35:08.360 --> 35:12.120]  from insurance companies, you name it, going back two years.
[35:12.120 --> 35:15.720]  The Moderna is the worst.
[35:15.720 --> 35:22.040]  The Moderna is an mRNA shot, the exact same sequence and program as the Pfizer, it's the
[35:22.040 --> 35:27.800]  equivalent of four Pfizer shots, not one.
[35:27.800 --> 35:33.560]  And almost all the time when we see major side effects, I go, let me guess, what's your
[35:33.560 --> 35:35.800]  son that was 13 die?
[35:35.800 --> 35:38.080]  You take the Moderna?
[35:38.080 --> 35:39.800]  Well, yeah, how'd you know?
[35:39.800 --> 35:42.560]  Well, I mean, it's the strongest one.
[35:42.560 --> 35:49.480]  So it's like a 50 caliber rifle shell versus a 308 rifle shell.
[35:49.480 --> 35:55.960]  So it is deadly, deadly, deadly, deadly, deadly.
[35:55.960 --> 36:04.040]  And we've got a clip here, it's on infowars.com, you need to share this to save lives.
[36:04.040 --> 36:12.120]  This is an NBC News report, vaccine injuries, six people, now that's who got sick and collapsed
[36:12.120 --> 36:16.280]  and passed out there.
[36:16.280 --> 36:22.960]  Moderna vaccine injures six people within hours of supervax center opening.
[36:22.960 --> 36:28.120]  Now remember, it turned out they had special prepared lots, they send to certain parts
[36:28.120 --> 36:32.880]  of the country, and major studies have found scientific studies, and Gregory should report
[36:32.880 --> 36:38.440]  a year ago on this, that they're sending them to key jurisdictions because it's a test.
[36:38.440 --> 36:43.520]  So you may have a whole vaccine center taking these so-called vaccines and nobody gets sick.
[36:43.520 --> 36:51.080]  And they went and studied the vials because they're saltwater, they're placebo.
[36:51.080 --> 36:55.760]  But in certain jurisdictions, particularly conservative jurisdictions, it's mainstream
[36:55.760 --> 37:02.680]  news, it's the most powerful shots of Moderna and Pfizer.
[37:02.680 --> 37:07.560]  There it is, you guys are so good, the cruise is incredible, only 1,300,000 views, evidence
[37:07.560 --> 37:11.280]  that the U.S. government targeted red states with deadly vaccines and vaccines.
[37:11.280 --> 37:16.320]  By the way, I'm not joking when I say 1.3 million is pathetic.
[37:16.320 --> 37:20.280]  That should have 100 million views, we would have defeated these people.
[37:20.280 --> 37:23.640]  Let's take that report, put it in the bottom of the live show feed today, out of the live
[37:23.640 --> 37:24.640]  show headline.
[37:24.640 --> 37:29.920]  Everybody, it's your job to share that, or you're crazy, because we're in an info war
[37:29.920 --> 37:33.920]  and the only way they succeed is the truth doesn't get out about this, so they obviously
[37:33.920 --> 37:38.720]  got some hot loads because they're studying different variants and different levels of
[37:38.720 --> 37:42.040]  whatever the hell it is, because a lot of what's in there is secret and patented and
[37:42.040 --> 37:44.680]  they said even government isn't allowed to know.
[37:44.680 --> 37:48.920]  This is true mad scientist, unapproved crap.
[37:48.920 --> 38:00.320]  So here is NBC News, NBC News reporting on this information, watch it for yourself.
[38:00.320 --> 38:05.880]  Now people at the vaccination superstation at Petco Park were turned away today after
[38:05.880 --> 38:11.040]  six people there had allergic reactions to the Moderna vaccine.
[38:11.040 --> 38:15.960]  It was the clustering of individuals having apparent allergic reactions that in abundance
[38:15.960 --> 38:21.840]  of caution they slowed things down to be able to address.
[38:21.840 --> 38:25.520]  County health officials said it was surprising to have that many reactions within a certain
[38:25.520 --> 38:30.920]  time period, so to be safe, the lot number of those vaccines, basically that was pulled
[38:30.920 --> 38:32.200]  from distribution.
[38:32.200 --> 38:36.080]  It's not clear what kind of side effects the people were feeling, but the county says
[38:36.080 --> 38:40.840]  it's expected to happen for any type of mass vaccination process, maybe just not such in
[38:40.840 --> 38:42.360]  a short time as it expected.
[38:42.360 --> 38:47.200]  Well, NBC 7's Dave Summers spoke with one of those six people who did experience an allergic
[38:47.200 --> 38:48.760]  reaction today.
[38:48.760 --> 38:53.080]  Deanna Canizzo is at home tonight after a four hour hospital stay.
[38:53.080 --> 38:58.280]  She tells NBC 7 she has had severe allergic reactions to other medications in the past,
[38:58.280 --> 38:59.280]  but never a vaccine.
[38:59.280 --> 39:03.080]  How do you feel about the whole experience?
[39:03.080 --> 39:04.840]  I'm still very unsure about it.
[39:04.840 --> 39:09.600]  I don't think I'm going to be getting the second dose because I can't go through that
[39:09.600 --> 39:10.600]  again.
[39:10.600 --> 39:13.240]  I've gotten vaccines my whole life.
[39:13.240 --> 39:19.520]  I just got the flu vaccine, so I didn't think that there would be any issue and I have no
[39:19.520 --> 39:25.880]  idea what it looked like, but the second I said something about my ear, they all sprung
[39:25.880 --> 39:33.360]  into action and they grabbed an EpiPen and they took me from the area where I was sitting
[39:33.360 --> 39:35.560]  at onto a gurney.
[39:35.560 --> 39:43.600]  Seems like a very traumatic result for someone who just went for a vaccine.
[39:43.600 --> 39:48.520]  Yeah, I mean, that's putting it mildly for sure.
[39:48.520 --> 39:53.000]  Of course, immediately I was regretting my decision.
[39:53.000 --> 39:54.520]  Notice they cut the tape in the middle.
[39:54.520 --> 39:57.360]  They didn't tell you what happened to her, but I checked the local news.
[39:57.360 --> 39:58.800]  They were having violent convulsions.
[39:58.800 --> 40:00.520]  She passed out.
[40:00.520 --> 40:01.520]  They were ready.
[40:01.520 --> 40:03.440]  They were doing a test.
[40:03.440 --> 40:04.640]  The locals aren't part of it.
[40:04.640 --> 40:06.040]  They see everybody getting sick.
[40:06.040 --> 40:08.840]  You know, it wasn't just six people.
[40:08.840 --> 40:10.080]  There's the FDA's own report.
[40:10.080 --> 40:14.160]  They quietly put it on their own website in October, 2000 on screen.
[40:14.160 --> 40:20.120]  Something that happened later, months after they started the shots, narcolepsy, convulsions,
[40:20.120 --> 40:24.000]  myocarditis, heart attacks.
[40:24.000 --> 40:26.760]  It goes on and on and on.
[40:26.760 --> 40:27.760]  That's just the first page.
[40:27.760 --> 40:32.960]  There's three pages of what it does to you and exactly what they said it might do.
[40:32.960 --> 40:33.960]  It did.
[40:33.960 --> 40:38.000]  Oh, but they told you in the fine print on their website, but they told you safe and
[40:38.000 --> 40:42.120]  effective, 100% protection if you just go take it.
[40:42.120 --> 40:45.880]  No criminal liars.
[40:45.880 --> 40:49.520]  Remember the Japanese prime minister who didn't allow forced injections and told Japanese
[40:49.520 --> 40:50.520]  not to take it?
[40:50.520 --> 40:53.040]  He got shot in the back twice.
[40:53.040 --> 40:57.000]  Assassinated Japanese prime minister didn't follow W.E.F. orders, didn't mandate vaccines,
[40:57.000 --> 41:01.840]  sent 1.6 million doses back and gave citizens ivermectin, just like four African presidents
[41:01.840 --> 41:06.200]  who said no to the shots, all got assassinated and shot or killed as well.
[41:06.200 --> 41:10.640]  And there it is, New York Post scientist who worked at Wuhan Labs.
[41:10.640 --> 41:13.440]  This cupboard was man-made, of course you already know that.
[41:13.440 --> 41:18.400]  Now you know why that nurse in Germany gave 10,000 people saline solution shots?
[41:18.400 --> 41:22.280]  Instead of the shot because she saw how many were getting sick and dying from it and the
[41:22.280 --> 41:25.240]  government didn't even prosecute her and you know why?
[41:25.240 --> 41:31.080]  Because they don't want her to have a trial where it all comes out, why she did it.
[41:31.080 --> 41:34.560]  And that's why all over the country they have those reports going back two years of like,
[41:34.560 --> 41:38.440]  we don't know why up to half of people got saline shots.
[41:38.440 --> 41:42.960]  Well part of it's the tests they mail out saline in areas they don't want to bomb with
[41:42.960 --> 41:43.960]  the weapon.
[41:43.960 --> 41:47.720]  But in other areas the doctors and nurses just wink, wink and give folks saline because
[41:47.720 --> 41:50.800]  they have a soul, they have a heart.
[41:50.800 --> 41:52.680]  We're going to go to break.
[41:52.680 --> 41:56.160]  We're going to talk about how this whole Twitter file ties into this because it was just political
[41:56.160 --> 41:57.160]  stuff being suppressed.
[41:57.160 --> 42:04.000]  It was people criticizing the Afghan withdrawal, people criticizing open borders, people criticizing
[42:04.000 --> 42:15.400]  election fraud, people criticizing the laptop, Hunter Biden, but also, also ladies and gentlemen,
[42:15.400 --> 42:21.280]  people criticizing the vaccines and trying to talk about that.
[42:21.280 --> 42:24.280]  That's in all the documents.
[42:24.280 --> 42:28.000]  And now I hope Elon Musk releases it all, I hope he's not holding the globalist hostage
[42:28.000 --> 42:31.880]  and just blackmailing him with this information, but regardless it's a big deal that's coming
[42:31.880 --> 42:36.840]  out and it shows there's not just evil in the universe.
[42:36.840 --> 42:37.840]  So that's coming up.
[42:37.840 --> 42:44.360]  What they don't want you to hear literally on the other side, infowars.com forward slash

[44:59.520 --> 45:06.280]  Until about 150 years ago cultures all over the world believe that people got sick and
[45:06.280 --> 45:10.840]  died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors.
[45:10.840 --> 45:15.280]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather.
[45:15.280 --> 45:20.120]  Of course it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people but was killing
[45:20.120 --> 45:23.720]  people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[45:23.720 --> 45:30.520]  You see the sun via your skin helps your body produce vitamin D3 but if you're not getting
[45:30.520 --> 45:35.600]  enough sun you will not produce vitamin D3 and then it's very easy for viruses and other
[45:35.600 --> 45:38.440]  things to start replicating and taking your body over.
[45:38.440 --> 45:42.360]  So now it's more important than ever because the winter is here to take high quality vitamin

[45:58.240 --> 46:05.760]  In Arizona, I think we watched the election be stolen, slowly stolen day by day counting
[46:05.760 --> 46:12.600]  these mail-in ballots and it's absolutely absurd for anyone to take our election seriously
[46:12.600 --> 46:19.240]  when we just, it's election month Alex, it's not election day and that's the problem.
[46:19.240 --> 46:21.840]  And everything changed after COVID-19.
[46:21.840 --> 46:28.760]  They illegally changed state elections, mailing ballots to anyone and everyone and sometimes
[46:28.760 --> 46:30.760]  mailing multiple ballots to people.
[46:30.760 --> 46:35.400]  Well, this isn't any way to run an election, we're in a serious country when we have elections
[46:35.400 --> 46:39.960]  that can be stolen like this and I believe that just like I believe the election was
[46:39.960 --> 46:45.680]  stolen in 2020 and I have no problem saying that and it is so absurd for the media and
[46:45.680 --> 46:51.760]  the Democrats to attack us that question our election integrity and question the fact that
[46:51.760 --> 46:55.360]  elections shouldn't be run the way they are.
[46:55.360 --> 47:01.600]  We're not election deniers, we're election realists.
[47:01.600 --> 47:08.800]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:08.800 --> 47:22.600]  Take the highway to the end of the night, end of the night, take a journey to the bright
[47:22.600 --> 47:38.720]  midnight, take a journey to the bright midnight, end of the night, end of the night, rounds
[47:38.720 --> 47:39.720]  of the night.
[47:39.720 --> 47:42.920]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this live Sunday, verboten
[47:42.920 --> 47:50.280]  forbidden transmission, we just showed you articles and documents and videos around the
[47:50.280 --> 47:55.120]  world with the leading universities, leading government scientists saying this erases your
[47:55.120 --> 47:59.480]  immune system and hurts you, it kills you, we got clips where they say, oh, you need
[47:59.480 --> 48:04.400]  six shots a year now, we told you that and that's why they want to silence, not because
[48:04.400 --> 48:10.200]  we're giving out disinformation, but because we're telling the truth, ladies and gentlemen.
[48:10.200 --> 48:14.960]  That's why all the attacks, everything I go through, I don't see that as a failure,
[48:14.960 --> 48:18.560]  like I'm just trying to advance myself, I'm trying to advance us all because if we don't
[48:18.560 --> 48:21.720]  all have a good world together, none of us have a good world.
[48:21.720 --> 48:27.240]  I do this for self preservation, I do it quite frankly out of instinctive selfishness, only
[48:27.240 --> 48:31.520]  these psychos and sociopaths screw everybody and destroy civilization and think they're
[48:31.520 --> 48:37.280]  going to have a good future in that, this is some heroic thing to do, it's the default
[48:37.280 --> 48:42.560]  to fight this, we're going to burrow into free speech and the attacks and what really
[48:42.560 --> 48:45.840]  happened with Yale and a bunch of exclusive information next hour, but let's get to this
[48:45.840 --> 48:53.520]  right now, breaking Elon Musk says there are more smoking gums to come and he's not suicidal,
[48:53.520 --> 48:57.960]  I am not suicidal, I'm totally alive, if they ever kill me and say I killed myself they
[48:57.960 --> 49:06.560]  murdered me 100%, I love life, none of this pressure gets to me and empowers me because
[49:06.560 --> 49:13.200]  of the strength and will and determination God gave me, very smart comment by Elon Musk
[49:13.200 --> 49:16.800]  whether he's good or bad, he's taking them on and the first trance he released he says
[49:16.800 --> 49:21.240]  dozens more, over 20 more things coming, Matt Teamy says he has thousands of pages at Rolling
[49:21.240 --> 49:26.560]  Stone proving the governments manipulated the 2020 election, proving this suppressed
[49:26.560 --> 49:35.160]  information about toxins and poisons in the vaccines, it's all coming out, there's Matt
[49:35.160 --> 49:41.400]  Teamy's thread, he goes on to say it's an incredible story from the inside, thousands
[49:41.400 --> 49:49.240]  of pages, dozens of reports coming and then we've got the full videos on info wars.com
[49:49.240 --> 49:56.680]  an article that James Woods videos posted in by Jamie White, it's a timid interview
[49:56.680 --> 50:01.160]  with Tucker Friday when James Woods learns what he already knew that he was specifically
[50:01.160 --> 50:06.480]  targeted in the messages recorded by Twitter executives that he would be taken off the
[50:06.480 --> 50:12.080]  air because he was too popular getting Republicans elected, direct criminal election meddling
[50:12.080 --> 50:15.360]  everything they told you the Russians were doing when quite frankly as you've seen in
[50:15.360 --> 50:19.760]  Ukraine the Russians have a primitive military when it comes to propaganda, they're like
[50:19.760 --> 50:24.760]  a two year old compared to the new world order, nothing against the Russians but as I've been
[50:24.760 --> 50:31.240]  telling you I've studied it, the Russians are a joke when it comes to comparing themselves
[50:31.240 --> 50:38.880]  to Hollywood and the DNC and the deep state, it's ridiculous, they've got 40 year old
[50:38.880 --> 50:43.400]  military equipment compared to ours, you hear our media say they've got all these advanced
[50:43.400 --> 50:51.600]  weapons, none of it's true other than their nuclear weapons, so that's the reality that
[50:51.600 --> 50:57.560]  James Woods has now discovered he was targeted and Tucker brings up the fact that I was targeted
[50:57.560 --> 50:59.800]  for destruction as well, here it is.
[50:59.800 --> 51:06.720]  I think the whole thing is astonishing, I'm just, I'm for the first time in my life honestly
[51:06.720 --> 51:07.720]  speechless.
[51:07.720 --> 51:13.080]  Well it is astonishing as you just pointed out civil law is used extensively by the
[51:13.080 --> 51:17.880]  left to really crush people on the right, Alex Jones just had a billion dollar settlement
[51:17.880 --> 51:20.560]  against him because he said something that he didn't hurt anybody, he said something
[51:20.560 --> 51:25.160]  people didn't like and they wrecked his life and the lives of many other people and they
[51:25.160 --> 51:30.920]  tried to wreck yours, is there some kind of legal or civil recourse that you would have
[51:30.920 --> 51:35.080]  against the people who violated your first amendment rights?
[51:35.080 --> 51:40.640]  I can guarantee you one thing, more than anything else you'll ever hear in your life, I will
[51:40.640 --> 51:47.160]  be getting a lawyer, I will be suing the Democratic National Committee no matter what, whether
[51:47.160 --> 51:53.880]  I win or lose, I am going to stand up for the rights that every American, not a so-called
[51:53.880 --> 52:00.200]  celebrity, I'm not a celebrity or I'm hardly recognizable anymore because my career has
[52:00.200 --> 52:05.760]  been destroyed by these very people and I will sue and I'm hoping other people will
[52:05.760 --> 52:11.440]  sue and if it turns out there are a lot of us on this list where the DNC targeted us
[52:11.440 --> 52:18.120]  and I will quote the immortal words of Joseph Welsh when he attacked Joe McCarthy for the
[52:18.120 --> 52:27.600]  enemies list he had, at long last or have you no shame, President Biden, all of your
[52:27.600 --> 52:37.600]  little operatives in the DNC who have targeted American citizens, have you, Mr. President,
[52:37.600 --> 52:41.160]  have all of you, at last, no shame?
[52:41.160 --> 52:46.960]  Yeah, and of course the answer is no, they don't have shame, but we will be following
[52:46.960 --> 52:52.120]  that and there may be more, clearly they were fixated on you, which I hope you take as a
[52:52.120 --> 52:57.120]  compliment but also propels you forward to bring justice.
[52:57.120 --> 53:02.040]  I think it is a compliment but it's a big price to pay, it's not a lot of fun, I loved
[53:02.040 --> 53:07.440]  my career for 50 years, I was happy to be an award-winning and honored and appreciated
[53:07.440 --> 53:13.680]  actor and I missed my career and these people took it from me and they'll pay a price later
[53:13.680 --> 53:20.200]  in my life but I have to say I am not going to take it sitting down, I think these people
[53:20.200 --> 53:25.400]  are vermin for doing this to other people, let's not talk about me for a moment, let's
[53:25.400 --> 53:31.560]  not talk about just simple individuals who put out a tweet and now their lives are destroyed,
[53:31.560 --> 53:39.160]  casting directors literally in my business literally go online and they check every actor
[53:39.160 --> 53:44.280]  who comes in for a part to see what they're following, if an actor or an actress is following
[53:44.280 --> 53:48.600]  me they will blacklist them, all right?
[53:48.600 --> 53:53.640]  It's about time this is torn open and I will tell you this, it's not just me but if you
[53:53.640 --> 53:58.320]  take the thousands of people that I'm sure they did this to and you got a class action
[53:58.320 --> 54:04.960]  too, they might not be so happy about that, they've been doing this as if you had against
[54:04.960 --> 54:11.520]  conservative people, I was blocked on Twitter for eight months, you know what I was suspended
[54:11.520 --> 54:20.280]  for quoting Ralph Waldo Emerson, do you imagine, that's how crazy these people are and one
[54:20.280 --> 54:24.520]  of the things that I said on Twitter once that has become kind of a meme, scratch a
[54:24.520 --> 54:30.080]  liberal and you'll find a fascist every time, let me tell you, these Democrats and now I
[54:30.080 --> 54:37.880]  can say it because they are no my enemy, they declare this not me but when they go around
[54:37.880 --> 54:41.960]  calling everybody, oh this is not the fascist and so on, none of the fascists are, scratch
[54:41.960 --> 54:45.080]  a liberal and you will find a fascist every time.
[54:45.080 --> 54:50.400]  And he goes on to say, I'm coming for you, I'm gonna get you, I know Olin's gonna play
[54:50.400 --> 54:56.160]  the full clip and Glenn Greenwald clip when he hosts 6 to 8 tonight, so much that we can't
[54:56.160 --> 55:02.040]  get to here is gonna be on Sunday Live, 6 to 8 p.m. hosting by Troyer tonight, so we'll
[55:02.040 --> 55:07.040]  make sure the full clip is played and this very powerful Glenn Greenwald breaks down
[55:07.040 --> 55:13.360]  really what's going on with all of this coming up.
[55:13.360 --> 55:17.480]  Let's play one more clip here because I mentioned this and I said I'd get to it, you know, we'll
[55:17.480 --> 55:21.360]  get to this next hour because nobody's picked us up, it's on m4s.com, it's on my place,
[55:21.360 --> 55:26.040]  Elon Musk saying he wanted to punch Yay for what he was saying and doing but then admitting
[55:26.040 --> 55:29.400]  that I tried to reign him in but he still has his free speech, so Elon, you gotta be
[55:29.400 --> 55:37.400]  an absolutist here, that's all coming up next hour, Roy Swight knocked it out of the park
[55:37.400 --> 55:42.880]  with his Yay breakdown instead of Yay is so bad for saying you like Sittler as a provocative
[55:42.880 --> 55:47.200]  statement, well then what about the U.S. government bringing tens of thousands of Nazis in under
[55:47.200 --> 55:51.760]  Operation Paperclip to run all the major agencies, I mean let's talk about what's really going
[55:51.760 --> 55:56.640]  on here, it's not that this is a Nazi run system, the globalists had created the Nazis,
[55:56.640 --> 56:01.920]  so you get the big secrets next hour, they don't want you to know, now let me say this,

[57:49.880 --> 57:55.320]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough and it's an absolute pleasure to introduce to you the wellness
[57:55.320 --> 58:02.240]  company, an alternative healthcare system for this COVID and post COVID world where
[58:02.240 --> 58:07.760]  trust has been lost in doctors and healthcare systems.
[58:07.760 --> 58:17.360]  This new online virtual platform is nationwide providing uncensored content, virtual appointments,
[58:17.360 --> 58:24.960]  laboratory testing, diagnostics, prescriptions, treatment packages specifically for COVID
[58:24.960 --> 58:30.840]  post COVID, vaccine injury syndromes and all the usual things that are seen in primary
[58:30.840 --> 58:32.640]  care.
[58:32.640 --> 58:39.600]  And then we have an entire array of holistic products, an online store, media and health
[58:39.600 --> 58:47.880]  advice, come see the wellness company and go to onlinehealthnow.com as a conduit to
[58:47.880 --> 58:50.120]  the wellness company.
[58:50.120 --> 58:56.040]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be
[58:56.040 --> 59:01.400]  allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[59:01.400 --> 59:05.240]  The First Amendment is unique in the world, that's what they want to take away, your ability
[59:05.240 --> 59:06.240]  to speak freely.
[59:06.240 --> 59:09.440]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next, or they're going to go for Steve Bannon, or
[59:09.440 --> 59:10.920]  they're going to go for Tucker Carlson.
[59:10.920 --> 59:15.240]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago but only 28 years and I knew they were planning all
[59:15.240 --> 59:19.400]  of this and I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere but I couldn't have done it without
[59:19.400 --> 59:20.400]  your support.
[59:20.400 --> 59:23.520]  And now because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, not
[59:23.520 --> 59:28.000]  just America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[59:28.000 --> 59:31.640]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful InfoWars has been
[59:31.640 --> 59:33.320]  because of your past support.
[59:33.320 --> 59:37.120]  So I salute you and I thank you and I ask you now, the critical juncture of the battle,
[59:37.120 --> 59:41.560]  free double your efforts of visiting InfoWarsStore.com and getting amazing products that keep us
[59:41.560 --> 59:42.560]  on air.
[59:42.560 --> 59:48.000]  1776 is the promo code, the destination is InfoWarsStore.com and I thank you all for
[59:48.000 --> 59:51.720]  your support.
[59:51.720 --> 01:00:06.160]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:11.800]  During Kanye West's appearance on the Alex Jones show, he praised Hitler while reading
[01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:12.800]  the Bible.
[01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:18.760]  He spoke about Zionists but failed to mention how they worked hand in hand with the Nazis
[01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:20.600]  to create Israel.
[01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:26.720]  He spoke out against porn but begged God to allow him his supermodel habit.
[01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:34.320]  In the entire time, he wore a Balenciaga styled BDSM mask without ever mentioning his close
[01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:36.320]  relationship with them.
[01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:40.240]  It was the epitome of cognitive dissonance.
[01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:45.480]  And as the political right praised Kanye as a Christian, the political left attacked
[01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:53.640]  him as a racist, both sides dancing together in gay fascination with the celebrity.
[01:00:53.640 --> 01:01:00.000]  This is also called idol worship and humans have a weak spot for it, although few will
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:06.320]  ever admit it.
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:13.760]  And while satiated with their bread and circus, one of Kanye's biggest benefactors, the CCP,
[01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:19.860]  is able to quietly round up thousands of protesters and disappear them without disturbing the
[01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:21.520]  sleeping masses.
[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:26.320]  The China show on YouTube has been doing a great job of covering this.
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:32.880]  The protests are nationwide and they are directed against Xi and the entire CCP.
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:59.560]  For the first time in decades, we are seeing a united solidarity among the people.
[01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:07.680]  He's saying give me liberty or give me death.
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:09.040]  Okay, that's what he's shouting.
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:14.720]  And you've got people actually chanting along with him, which is normally not the case.
[01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:17.960]  Because people are like, holy crap, if someone's doing that, they're like, he's crazy, stay
[01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:20.560]  away from me, I don't want anything to do with it.
[01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:45.680]  But the important thing is what happens when the police do finally arrive.
[01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:50.480]  They rescue him, and I mean, this is the first time I've ever seen anything like this happen
[01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:51.480]  in China.
[01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:52.480]  Okay?
[01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:54.040]  And it's happening all over China.
[01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:57.680]  We have Lan Zhou, we have Chongqing, we have other parts of Guangzhou, which we're
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:02:59.400]  already protesting.
[01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:04.680]  We have Beijing, we have third tier, fourth tier, fifth tier cities.
[01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:09.920]  We have top tier universities down to low level vocational schools.
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:14.840]  We have people on the streets, we have officials being kidnapped out of government buildings.
[01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:16.640]  We have people parading through the streets.
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:19.640]  We have people tearing down police stations.
[01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:22.960]  We have PLA deployed, People's Liberation Army.
[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:24.220]  We have SWAT teams.
[01:03:24.220 --> 01:03:27.240]  We have this across the entire country.
[01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:33.240]  The reason we've only seen a glimpse of this massive protest is the CCP's censorship.
[01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:38.040]  They routinely stop people on the train and check their phones for VPNs.
[01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:41.360]  And they jam the signals once a protest breaks out.
[01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:46.120]  They're sending signal jammers into places of protest in order to, you know, stop people's
[01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:49.280]  cell phones so they can't send messages, they can't send videos.
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:52.840]  People are coming into massive clashes just right in the street and people are getting
[01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:56.080]  cell phone videos that before the signal jammers can show up.
[01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:59.680]  We're seeing stuff come to a head and then it just stops.
[01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:05.440]  And because everyone is required to have their mobile phone apps in order, the police simply
[01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:11.880]  switched off the apps where the protests were happening so that nobody could board the train.
[01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:15.640]  Because of the phone apps, they knew exactly where to find everyone.
[01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:21.800]  So they knocked on doors, beat people in their own homes and dragged them off to the quarantine
[01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:23.000]  camps.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:29.480]  While Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates believe Communist China is the model for the world,
[01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:56.840]  Black Rock's CEO says that the markets prefer totalitarian government.
[01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:05.040]  So when I first started taking survival skills, basically I was 275 pounds overweight.
[01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:07.440]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:11.920]  I was barely holding on to a job and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:15.120]  So the first one I got was the original survival skills, the X1.
[01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:16.400]  And it worked pretty good.
[01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:19.440]  And then shortly thereafter, you came out with that stew, you had, you know, with a
[01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:21.840]  deep burn source, you know, and I got really excited about that.
[01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:27.760]  So I took it and man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain
[01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:28.840]  was enlightened.
[01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:32.080]  You know, I could think again, I could connect with people again.
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:36.680]  And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back and I religiously
[01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:38.480]  take basically all of your supplements.
[01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:40.880]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:44.920]  The one I like recently is knockout literally like if you want to sleep, just take it.
[01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:45.640]  It's amazing.
[01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:46.200]  It works.
[01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:48.800]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean.
[01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:51.280]  We have to break free of the globalist system.
[01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:54.920]  And the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[01:05:54.920 --> 01:06:01.880]  You beautifully said, brother, I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed front lines
[01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:04.320]  of the information war.
[01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:13.480]  It's Alex Jones, Kanye West, now yay, was in studio over three hours and 10 minutes
[01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:18.360]  on Thursday, and it was hands down the biggest thing we ever did.
[01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:25.960]  We had up to 60, 70 million people tune in on the election in the few days leading up
[01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:28.160]  to an election day 2016.
[01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:31.000]  The globalists saw that came after 10 times harder.
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:35.360]  They admitted, oh my God, you know, you had 86 million, 87 million viewers in three days.
[01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:36.360]  We got to stop this.
[01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:40.000]  And those were people on the site, watching the videos, click on the links, not to mention
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.240]  the hundreds of radio stations.
[01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:46.680]  And so now this thing was absolutely huge and I'll give you the inside baseball.
[01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:50.800]  I said, look, you can talk about whatever you want, but I really want to get off the
[01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:51.800]  juice of its distraction.
[01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:56.120]  But if you want to spend some time on that, go ahead, oh no, and about love and, you know,
[01:06:56.120 --> 01:07:01.800]  human trafficking and the election and all this, but I said to him, you're not a Nazi,
[01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:02.800]  are you?
[01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:04.640]  And then that's where the whole provocateur thing went.
[01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:08.360]  And he means it to shake up the internet and point out the hypocrisy on the side.
[01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:14.360]  He basically admitted that it was a provocateur action and he certainly got what he wanted.
[01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:18.920]  And since then, a lot's happened, I get a call and they said, hey, Elon Musk does these
[01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:23.160]  chats that only people that get invited can get fined and then people share it.
[01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:25.280]  It's kind of like Treehouse was a few years ago.
[01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:29.400]  He's on right now with like 50 people by the time I got, it was like a hundred and he was
[01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:33.920]  talking about, he wanted to punch you in the face and how I tried to rainy men, which made
[01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:35.120]  me the reasonable one.
[01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:36.360]  We got that clip coming up.
[01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:37.360]  Nobody's even put that clip out.
[01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:38.360]  It's on info wars.com.
[01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:45.080]  So a lot of stuff is in the background here, but I got sent a link, um, Saturday morning
[01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:49.960]  or I guess a podcast Friday that I thought took a 10 minute clip.
[01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:51.280]  It's posted on info wars.com.
[01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:56.360]  We posted Saturday, but there's a few minutes up in here where Royce White, former NBA player,
[01:07:56.360 --> 01:08:00.000]  MMA fighter, and no, no stranger to the show.
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:01.000]  I really respect him.
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.680]  He's one of the best brains we've got out there.
[01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:06.200]  So I tried to boost what he's doing and he's been very prolific for years, but he's really
[01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:07.200]  exploding right now.
[01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:08.200]  That's a good thing.
[01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:12.360]  I think his analysis cut right through to the heart of it.
[01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:14.640]  That is exactly what he was doing.
[01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:19.880]  If you're going to say somebody saying they love Hitler's bad or that they love Nazis,
[01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:22.040]  but they also love Zionists, it was tongue in cheek.
[01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:23.400]  Well, what about our government?
[01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:27.360]  Now, the only thing Royce got wrong and he's right, mainstream news says a thousand plus
[01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:33.600]  high level Nazis, Bernard Ron Braun, Goddard, you name it, uh, Klaus Barbie, but it, but
[01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:40.120]  mainline news admits actually 35 to 37 to 40,000 Nazis were brought in after World War
[01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:42.440]  II to help run the deep state.
[01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:47.160]  And that's because Nazism came out of eugenics in England and the US, not our whole government,
[01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:48.160]  but that movement.
[01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:50.000]  That's a historical fact.
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:54.200]  And so in the Cold War, they wanted them here because they had actually basically picked
[01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:59.160]  up globalist ideology, but only done it under Hitler's direction in a little bit different
[01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:00.160]  way.
[01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:03.680]  And when Royce points out, before everybody shakes their finger at yay, it's not about
[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:05.200]  defending Kanye.
[01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:08.400]  It's about, okay, well, if he's bad, then we're saying he loves Hitler.
[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:12.360]  How about our government bringing in Hitler type people that actually were the heart of
[01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:17.200]  Hitler's operation and then having them run secret programs, releasing radiation on poor
[01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:21.720]  people in Appalachia or New Mexico or on Native American tribes, but white people too.
[01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:26.120]  It's poor people they hit or shooting up 10,000 plus black men with syphilis and letting
[01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:27.240]  them then spread it.
[01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:31.440]  So the Nazis weren't exported here.
[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:37.280]  They were coming home and he breaks that down and I didn't see his whole podcast.
[01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:40.920]  He was a guest on the show, but I watched the 10 minute clip that I was sent.
[01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:41.920]  It's only in FullWars.com.
[01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:43.160]  But here's a few minutes of that.
[01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:47.680]  I'm gonna go to Royce White because he cuts right to the chase of the Psyop and the Internet
[01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:54.560]  and the whole culture we're in is a product of these eugenicists and these mind wars.
[01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:58.440]  He'd just sit there and then have them point it, yeah, as if he's the devil is the total
[01:09:58.440 --> 01:09:59.440]  fraud.
[01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:00.600]  Here it is.
[01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:02.040]  Operation paperclip.
[01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:08.640]  Let's not get lost on Kanye West saying that he loves Nazis because we as a country
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:10.720]  love the Nazis.
[01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:15.360]  We loved the Nazis and we still love the Nazis.
[01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:17.760]  Now who were the Nazis?
[01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:20.600]  That's an important question that we need to answer today.
[01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:22.320]  Who were the Nazis?
[01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:24.280]  What was Operation Paperclip?
[01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:30.240]  Why did we bring 1600, so they say, could have been 16,000, could have been 106,000.
[01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:31.240]  We don't know.
[01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:38.640]  Why did they bring 1600 of the Nazi party's top scientists and political figures, not
[01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:42.920]  just scientists, but also political leaders of the Nazi party?
[01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:45.640]  Why did they bring them into the American government?
[01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:51.240]  See, in their lies, the moral hazard that undergirds this entire deal.
[01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:53.240]  They got nothing to do with Kanye.
[01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:55.120]  Kanye doesn't even know about it.
[01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:57.720]  That's not the purview of what he's bringing to the table.
[01:10:57.720 --> 01:10:58.720]  But I will.
[01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:00.680]  I'll ask the question.
[01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:05.720]  Why did we, after World War II, when we made it seem like we went to fight for the massacre
[01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:11.320]  of the Jews, take the very people who orchestrated it and assimilate them into our military and
[01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:12.320]  government?
[01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:13.640]  Why did we do that?
[01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:19.920]  Why were the people who actually funded the Nazi war machine on the front end from Wall
[01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:26.720]  Street then have the ability to reincorporate Nazi science and philosophy into America's
[01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:29.080]  government and military?
[01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:30.080]  Why?
[01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:37.040]  Because we were more concerned with military power, political power, economic power than
[01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:39.600]  we were the principal.
[01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:40.600]  We're the sellouts.
[01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:45.320]  Our nation has moral hazard from World War II that we have yet to deal with.
[01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:51.240]  You can't send me off on some blank mission or some side street about Kanye West making
[01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:56.640]  some silly off-the-cuff remark with a mask on to get attention from a theatrical career
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:12:01.720]  that he's always lived up to and distract me from the truth.
[01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:04.960]  Who were the Nazis to begin with?
[01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:06.120]  Who was Adolf Hitler?
[01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:07.120]  He wasn't German.
[01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:08.120]  He was an Austrian.
[01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:11.240]  Who was the Austrian Empire?
[01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:13.320]  Who is the crown today?
[01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:15.560]  Who is Saxe Colbert?
[01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:21.040]  Why was the Saxe Colbert name changed to Windsor at the end of during World War I when the
[01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:23.840]  Germans and the British went to fight each other?
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:29.600]  Why does nobody talk about the crown and the monarchy sending British dukes and duchesses
[01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:39.400]  across the European, across Europe to fill the monarch positions of other countries?
[01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:46.120]  This is the history that we have to discuss because we need to know just how prominent
[01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:55.520]  the Nazi mindset, the Nazi philosophy is in our government today right now.
[01:12:55.520 --> 01:13:01.880]  So when I look at a person like Milo who came from Britain and is a homosexual, a reformed
[01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:06.320]  homosexual, I start to ask myself, who are these people?
[01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:10.040]  Who are these people and why should we trust they are who they say they are?
[01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:16.320]  And then you got Kanye saying that his trainer was an ex-Canadian security state officer
[01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:19.000]  or employee.
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:20.000]  Who are they?
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:25.720]  See, we at home, we have not yet accepted the level of deception that is potentially
[01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:26.720]  out there.
[01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:31.600]  Okay, we're going to hear from the man himself, but you talk about 100% proof, 200% it was
[01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:32.600]  alcohol.
[01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:39.280]  That means 100%, I mean Royce White is over the target and that's what I'm telling people.
[01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:42.760]  The king of England, Eber the Eight had to advocate during World War II because he was
[01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:47.200]  pro-Hitler and he was used to set up the Nazis and a whole double-agent off.
[01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:50.760]  That's in mainline history books, but yeah, Kanye doesn't know all that.
[01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:56.800]  That's what was so frustrating is that Hitler was like a Frankenstein monster that the British
[01:13:56.800 --> 01:13:57.800]  created.
[01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:00.840]  I'm Welsh, I'm English, I'm not bashing British people.
[01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:06.520]  I mean, that's what did it because I saw the young Turks, he just, Jones hates people
[01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:07.520]  in England.
[01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:08.520]  Give me a freaking break, man.
[01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:11.160]  We're talking about big adult stuff here.
[01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:14.480]  We're talking about, yeah, there's the king of England without all Hitler.
[01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:20.280]  So he was German, he was Austrian actually, just like Royce White said and that's the
[01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:21.280]  truth.
[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:23.320]  Prince Charles says he wants to depopulate the world.
[01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:26.680]  His dad said he wanted to be a virus to depopulate the world.
[01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:31.480]  Prince Philip was in photos with Hitler as well, oh, oh, and George Soros helped round
[01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:35.280]  up Jews for Hitler, but he's okay and gets 80 yellow wards.
[01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:41.920]  This is a sick joke, people, absolutely sick and the American people are tired of being
[01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:46.240]  called Nazis when we're surrounded by stuff that created the Nazis.
[01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:50.360]  Let's be clear, it's not the Nazis run America and run the New World Order, the people that
[01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:56.040]  created the Nazis run us as their opposition so they could be the good cop, the liberals
[01:14:56.040 --> 01:15:00.800]  while they created Hitler, but while they carry out all the same policies, Nuremberg
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:06.320]  violating force medication, control, division, all of it is the same program.
[01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:07.320]  Royce White's our guest.
[01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:09.440]  We're going to go to break and come back.
[01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:10.920]  I want him to get fired up.
[01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:15.080]  He's really calm and nice on my show, but I want him to get all mean like he does on
[01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:19.440]  other shows and kind of take over here and lay it out because this is the reality and
[01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:23.400]  I want to get Royce White down here with Yay next time because Yay wants to work being
[01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:26.960]  that's great and wants to start doing shows every week and we're happy to do it, but
[01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:30.640]  I'm going to sit him down and show him all this because he needs to know this and imagine
[01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:34.640]  us in a big movie theater showing clips to him showing him documents and making a documentary
[01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:35.640]  about that.
[01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:40.520]  We need to do this immediately because this is a lot bigger and I've told these stories
[01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:42.520]  and I'm not joking around about it, okay?
[01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:48.200]  Well, I mean, I'll get to it when we come back, but my grandfather worked in secret
[01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:51.280]  military operations had to deal with these damn Nazis right here in Texas.
[01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:58.280]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[01:15:58.280 --> 01:16:05.120]  In Arizona, I think we watched the election be stolen, slowly stolen day by day counting
[01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:11.960]  these mail-in ballots and it's absolutely absurd for anyone to take our election seriously
[01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:18.200]  when we just, it's election month, Alex, it's not election day and that's the problem
[01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:25.160]  and everything changed after COVID-19, they illegally changed state elections, mailing
[01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:30.120]  ballots to anyone and everyone and sometimes mailing multiple ballots to people.
[01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:34.760]  Well, this isn't any way to run an election, we're in a serious country when we have elections
[01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:39.320]  that can be stolen like this and I believe that just like I believe the election was
[01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:45.040]  stolen in 2020 and I have no problem saying that and it is so absurd for the media and
[01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:51.080]  the Democrats to attack us that question our election integrity and question the fact that
[01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:54.680]  elections shouldn't be run the way they are.
[01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:58.720]  We're not election deniers, we're election realists.
[01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:04.600]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be
[01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:09.920]  allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deemed fit.
[01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:13.800]  The First Amendment is unique in the world, that's what they want to take away, your ability
[01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:14.800]  to speak freely.
[01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:17.920]  So, they're going to go for Mike Lindell next or they're going to go for Steve Bannon
[01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:19.480]  or they're going to go for Tucker Carlson.
[01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:23.600]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago but only 28 years and I knew they were planning
[01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:27.920]  all of this and I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere but I couldn't have done it without
[01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:31.320]  your support and now because we've been so successful warning the population of the
[01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:35.480]  planet, not just America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist
[01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:36.480]  agenda.
[01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:40.200]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful Info Wars has been
[01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:44.400]  because of your past support so I salute you and I thank you and I ask you now to critical

[01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:08.360]  Making a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:23.480]  I'm going to lay some real stuff on you folks, I'm just saying these things on air, like
[01:20:23.480 --> 01:20:29.040]  Kanye West was here a few days ago and you know, Trump says I'm an amazing person, that's
[01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:34.520]  not about my ego, it's about what we've done here together on air, but my grandfather
[01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:38.800]  was a very secretive person and his son went on to be high level army special operations
[01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:42.960]  and worked for the CIA and I never knew all the stuff he did and my mother told me some
[01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:47.040]  of it because he kept it all secret but when he got out of World War II, he was on the
[01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:54.480]  Army Air Corps, he got involved in secret projects and they were developing basically
[01:20:54.480 --> 01:21:00.160]  crowd control robots or remote control radio controlled, the technology's old and I remember
[01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:03.600]  him bitching when I was a little kid about how arrogant the Nazis were and how he didn't
[01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:06.880]  want to work with them at military bases and how he couldn't stand them but we don't need
[01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:11.880]  to believe Alex Jones' story about his grandfather, you need to listen to me, they brought 30
[01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:16.360]  plus thousand of them here to be involved in every research project, NASA was started
[01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:21.920]  by him, the Goddard Space Center, all of it and the CIA, all of it Nazis, Nazis, Nazis,
[01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:25.360]  it wasn't like some special thing that my grandfather worked with him, he was an American
[01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:29.760]  patriot and got out of it because he couldn't stand working with the Nazis and he told me
[01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:35.520]  that when I'm like eight years old, he would just start running his mouth about it and
[01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:37.080]  talking about it.
[01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:41.360]  So that's the reality, I'm going to go to Roy Swight to talk about this now and we've
[01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:45.320]  got to educate you about this, Roy Swight good to have you on, I appreciate you coming
[01:21:45.320 --> 01:21:46.320]  on.
[01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:49.400]  Thanks for having me man, I appreciate it as always.
[01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:52.960]  That was a powerful 10 minute clip I saw, we didn't play all of it, lay it on us again,
[01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:54.800]  get into all the points right here.
[01:21:54.800 --> 01:22:02.080]  Well first I want to say this, when you can't talk about people through their identity,
[01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:06.880]  through their culture and their traditions, it becomes very difficult to talk about people
[01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:13.160]  at all and it becomes very difficult to talk about history, we are the historical being,
[01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:17.560]  human beings are the historical being, that is one of God's greatest gifts to us, it allows
[01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:22.080]  us to be able to have knowledge and to be able to transfer knowledge from one generation
[01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:23.080]  to the next.
[01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:27.680]  This allows us to have some sort of coherence or continuity, mostly as a mechanism to be
[01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:31.880]  able to maintain faith in my opinion as a Christian.
[01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:40.040]  What globalist and globalism mean to do in large part is to take from people their identity,
[01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:44.600]  their culture, their traditions, so that they can subscribe you a new one, so that they
[01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:48.120]  can give you your history.
[01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:52.360]  That's what my problem is with this entire conversation right now, is that there is a
[01:22:52.360 --> 01:22:56.800]  history that we've been told, that we've been told in textbooks, that we've been told in
[01:22:56.800 --> 01:23:03.200]  documentaries, that we've been told culturally from the establishment, meaning our teachers
[01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:10.320]  who were Marxists, communists, and disseminate what's in the textbooks for young kids who
[01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:14.400]  may not be reading it thoroughly.
[01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:20.040]  The history is the post-World War II democratic liberal order, and that is the New World Order,
[01:23:20.040 --> 01:23:22.480]  and there's no doubt about that being the New World Order.
[01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:28.080]  The question is how the story of World War II is told, and who they identify as being
[01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:34.560]  the Nazis, and why they're so silent about the Nazi, not infiltration, but acceptance
[01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:42.200]  from our government into our military, which then became a military that then became DARPA,
[01:23:42.200 --> 01:23:48.000]  that then created the Internet, that then used the psychoanalysis of rats that figured
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:53.320]  out that a rat would actually electrocute itself to press a button that would give it
[01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:56.040]  a dopamine hit in the experiment.
[01:23:56.040 --> 01:24:00.720]  This is who we've become, they've turned us into a lab experiment, a scientific experiment.
[01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:04.080]  There's nothing more Nazi than that, but I think even more importantly is this sort
[01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:11.400]  of cultural, philosophical, and ideological prism of what Nazism is, what fascism is,
[01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:14.080]  what liberalism is, what communism is.
[01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:19.240]  These are post-enlightenment, post-Renaissance, post-enlightenment ideologies that stem back
[01:24:19.240 --> 01:24:25.160]  to three central ideologies, liberalism, communism, and neoclassicism, okay?
[01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:26.880]  They're all from the same fruit.
[01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:32.040]  They're all from the same scientific tree, Descartes, I think therefore I am.
[01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:36.480]  It was all an anti-God initiative from the beginning, so for us to be fooled in the present
[01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:42.760]  and thinking that liberalism, and communism, or fascism, are these vastly different ideologies,
[01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:48.240]  it's primitive, it's silly, it's naive, it's a form of good cop, bad cop, you've got this
[01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:53.640]  full spectrum of thought, they give you communism, fascism, Nazism, a few choices, but they're
[01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:58.000]  all different flavors of the same thing.
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:01.120]  Think about who the Nazis are, and I like that you say well the Nazis aren't really
[01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:04.360]  running it verbatim, I say they are.
[01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:08.320]  I say when you understand the history and you look at it from a societal standpoint,
[01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:14.520]  the liberals in this country, and I use liberal as a wide term to encapsulate everybody from
[01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:20.560]  AOC all the way over to the Bushes, and a little bit beyond, and maybe even further
[01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:26.240]  beyond nowadays, the liberals are the exact same people that the Nazis were.
[01:25:26.240 --> 01:25:32.040]  First, they were the working class that unionized, they became the bourgeoisie, okay?
[01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:37.560]  They rigged the system, they cut off social mobility, and then they created a military
[01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:41.760]  state to secure their power, and then they went in on the night of long nives to kill
[01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:46.960]  anybody who came up with them in order to ensure that there was no opposition.
[01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:48.400]  That's who the Nazis were in Germany.
[01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:52.160]  Royce, I have one trillion percent agree and you are so learned and smart.
[01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:57.360]  When I say we're not Nazis, I mean it's not a Nazi thing, Hitler secretly runs America,
[01:25:57.360 --> 01:26:02.640]  he was a spinoff of the group here and the Nazis were coming home.
[01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:09.800]  I think if you look closely, and this is why the conversation about the group of people
[01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:15.800]  who have, you could say hi Jack, the Jew identity, because here's my take on it Alex.
[01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:18.080]  If you don't believe in God, you're not a Jew.
[01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:20.240]  Let's just be clear, okay?
[01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:24.920]  The Jewish tradition is a 5,700 year old oral and written tradition.
[01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:33.160]  It gave birth in many ways to Christianity, it gave birth to this country in many ways,
[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:40.360]  and for those people to carry that tradition across 5,700 year span is one of the greatest
[01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:41.360]  accomplishments.
[01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:44.880]  It's got to be respected, but most of the people that claim that today, I have nothing
[01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:47.400]  to do with it.
[01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:51.840]  Most of the people who claim it today don't believe in that tradition, that's right, and
[01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:57.600]  actually it is in my opinion one of the greatest forms of anti-Semitism to call the one true
[01:26:57.600 --> 01:27:02.920]  living God, the Abrahamic God, fake, a fairytale, a crackpot story.
[01:27:02.920 --> 01:27:07.320]  I mean there's some deep anti-Semitism in that alone.
[01:27:07.320 --> 01:27:13.480]  I agree, liberal Jews are attacking the heart of Judaism and they persecute the Hasidic
[01:27:13.480 --> 01:27:17.520]  and ultra-Orthodox major league.
[01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:22.040]  And my point in bringing that up is in the black community, for example, here in America,
[01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:27.280]  we are very okay with accepting the idea that there are people who claim to be pro-black
[01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:36.240]  who have been intimately involved in the stalling or suspending black people in a sort of pre-societal
[01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:38.320]  maturity, right?
[01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:43.160]  From growth and development, from ownership, from American citizenship, from freedom, okay,
[01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:44.800]  a nation of shopkeepers.
[01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:49.560]  There are black people in America who aid the system in doing this, it just happens
[01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:54.840]  to be the group of black people that the system props up the most.
[01:27:54.840 --> 01:28:00.600]  So I don't understand why we have such a hard time believing that there were many anti-Jews
[01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:06.920]  like George Soros who aided and abetted the Nazi persecution of the Jews and that continue
[01:28:06.920 --> 01:28:11.200]  to carry on with the sort of modus operandi to this very day.
[01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:15.540]  It's completely, it's completely reasonable and I know that as a black man because I could
[01:28:15.540 --> 01:28:21.560]  point you to a number of black people who have huge platforms whose individual behavior
[01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:28.440]  is antithetical to calling for any real growth in maturity and security or prosperity of
[01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:29.920]  black citizens in America.
[01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:33.920]  Well, that's right, they don't want any of us to have security and maturity.
[01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:37.720]  Royce White is knocking it out of the park, amazing, man.
[01:28:37.720 --> 01:28:40.920]  How do people find what you're doing?
[01:28:40.920 --> 01:28:45.320]  You can follow me on Getter, you can follow me on TruthSocial, you can follow me anywhere.
[01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:48.320]  You know, follow my sub-stack as well, I write about a lot of these things.
[01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:52.280]  Stay there, we're going to ride back, my brother, powerful.
[01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:59.840]  This is the truth, you can feel it, this is real truth, this is veritas.
[01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:04.520]  Everybody that's watching this needs to support Alex Jones, needs to support InfoWars and
[01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:05.520]  band.video.
[01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:09.800]  You know, the Bible says, let another mouth praise you, I'm going to do that right now.
[01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:15.840]  Alex Jones has helped so many people in this industry, you guys have no idea how many people
[01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:20.960]  have got their first start like Savannah Hernandez, how many people have just been put on a launch
[01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:24.840]  pad, the outer space because of Alex Jones, including myself.
[01:29:24.840 --> 01:29:29.360]  I've been given so many opportunities because of this man and because of this platform and
[01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:33.400]  I would probably not even be half of where I am right now if it weren't for Alex Jones.
[01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:38.200]  I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan and Tim Cass, the super
[01:29:38.200 --> 01:29:44.840]  Tim Cass IRL, listen, what I'm saying is, do not take Alex Jones and band.video for granted
[01:29:44.840 --> 01:29:47.400]  because you don't know what you have until it's gone.
[01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:52.120]  We need to support free speech systems right now, so go check out the store, go support
[01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:59.480]  their store, go support InfoWars, leave a donation right now, don't wait until they're gone.
[01:29:59.480 --> 01:30:04.960]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough and it's an absolute pleasure to introduce to you the Wellness
[01:30:04.960 --> 01:30:06.840]  Company.
[01:30:06.840 --> 01:30:12.480]  An alternative healthcare system for this COVID and post COVID world where trust has
[01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:17.360]  been lost in doctors and healthcare systems.

[01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:40.480]  post COVID, vaccine injury syndromes and all the usual things that are seen in primary
[01:30:40.480 --> 01:30:42.240]  care.
[01:30:42.240 --> 01:30:49.240]  And then we have an entire array of holistic products, an online store, media and health
[01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:50.480]  advice.

[01:30:59.920 --> 01:31:06.640]  Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world believe that people got sick and
[01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:11.240]  died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors.
[01:31:11.240 --> 01:31:15.680]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather.
[01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:20.520]  Of course it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people, what was killing
[01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:24.120]  people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[01:31:24.120 --> 01:31:30.240]  You see the sun via your skin helps your body produce vitamin D3.
[01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:34.240]  But if you're not getting enough sun, you will not produce vitamin D3 and then it's
[01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:38.800]  very easy for viruses and other things to start replicating and taking your body over.
[01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:42.760]  So now it's more important than ever because the winter is here to take high quality vitamin

[01:33:00.360 --> 01:33:13.840]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:25.200]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:41.600]  I've decided I'm not going to commit suicide ever, it's like Elon Musk just said, but I'm
[01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:46.920]  going to go ahead and tell everybody in the next few weeks everything I saw as a child.
[01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:47.920]  Most of it I haven't said yet.
[01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:51.560]  Just give you an idea why I'm so awake and why I know what I'm talking about.
[01:33:51.560 --> 01:33:56.160]  My family opposed all this from the inside, I can tell you that right now.
[01:33:56.160 --> 01:34:00.120]  Imagine me and my grandfather in the Army Air Corps having come back involving secret
[01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:03.320]  projects and being stuck with a bunch of Nazis, he had a babysit.
[01:34:03.320 --> 01:34:06.920]  Then I learned about this when I was a kid and the family was all like hush hush about
[01:34:06.920 --> 01:34:07.920]  it.
[01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:12.440]  It's embarrassing to even work with those people, but that's our government, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:14.480]  That's who's been running things the whole time.
[01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:16.040]  They created the Nazis.
[01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:20.240]  Royce White, you are landing on them hard right now with this situation.
[01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:22.520]  A lot of folks are tuned in about the Yale interview.
[01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:23.680]  I don't want to judge him.
[01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:27.960]  I don't know if he's in mind control or autistic or what he means well.
[01:34:27.960 --> 01:34:29.400]  I know it's the biggest thing ever.
[01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:31.080]  It's bringing a lot of listeners to the show.
[01:34:31.080 --> 01:34:35.200]  I'm still ambivalent about it, but I saw those connections you brought up, the things
[01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:36.200]  that were said.
[01:34:36.200 --> 01:34:38.480]  That he is being used by some forces.
[01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:39.480]  It's not me.
[01:34:39.480 --> 01:34:40.480]  It's not you.
[01:34:40.480 --> 01:34:41.480]  I want to help him.
[01:34:41.480 --> 01:34:43.800]  If you got any comments on Yale or what you would say to Yale, he's probably watching
[01:34:43.800 --> 01:34:47.040]  right now and then let's move on to the last two seconds, whatever you want to talk about.
[01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:51.480]  I want to invite you back this week for a couple hours on the show to take calls with
[01:34:51.480 --> 01:34:52.480]  me.
[01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:57.040]  Of course, any time and you know, one of the things that I respect about you, Alex, that
[01:34:57.040 --> 01:35:02.200]  I've seen you do now for 15 years since I was introduced to you in my later teenage
[01:35:02.200 --> 01:35:06.000]  years is that you think in four dimensions.
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:07.240]  You think in three dimensions.
[01:35:07.240 --> 01:35:13.040]  You don't allow the establishment to force feed you a two-dimensional frame to put these
[01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:17.600]  ideas or discussions in and then you end up ultimately coming out wrong.
[01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:21.080]  You get double-crossed and triple-crossed when you do that.
[01:35:21.080 --> 01:35:25.440]  It's too easy for the devil to work and deceive in two dimensions.
[01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:27.520]  So you're somebody that I always respect for that.
[01:35:27.520 --> 01:35:30.840]  I think Kanye has an intuition towards that.
[01:35:30.840 --> 01:35:37.480]  He definitely is an original and authentic sort of voice, but because he comes from the
[01:35:37.480 --> 01:35:43.480]  theatrical, because he comes from the entertainment industry, he has an affinity for the drama.
[01:35:43.480 --> 01:35:48.120]  He has an affinity for a sort of troll-like behavior and he became great at that.
[01:35:48.120 --> 01:35:55.240]  That's how Kanye West separated himself from being a masterful producer and became a very
[01:35:55.240 --> 01:36:01.440]  good rapper, but he became a pop culture icon through this sort of troll-like behavior.
[01:36:01.440 --> 01:36:04.280]  And that's okay in some instances.
[01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:10.480]  We are talking about being black, being white, being Jewish, the history of Africa, the history
[01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:11.480]  of Europe.
[01:36:11.480 --> 01:36:13.320]  Yeah, he's in the biggest leagues now.
[01:36:13.320 --> 01:36:16.200]  You can't troll around at this level.
[01:36:16.200 --> 01:36:22.040]  World War I, World War II, religion, race, all of this is at the center of the way our
[01:36:22.040 --> 01:36:24.760]  society is currently organized.
[01:36:24.760 --> 01:36:27.080]  And I don't say that in some metaphysical way.
[01:36:27.080 --> 01:36:29.760]  The post-World War II democratic liberal order.
[01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:32.040]  I'm going to interrupt you and I'm going to shut up the rest of the hour, but what you
[01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:33.640]  just said is so central.
[01:36:33.640 --> 01:36:37.920]  They don't want us discussing the central way they control us and how it's organized.
[01:36:37.920 --> 01:36:40.320]  We're talking, I'm getting chills right now.
[01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:42.040]  We're telling you how it works, folks.
[01:36:42.040 --> 01:36:43.040]  This is it.
[01:36:43.040 --> 01:36:44.640]  It's all new world orders post-World War II.
[01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:45.640]  They admit that.
[01:36:45.640 --> 01:36:46.640]  Bretton Woods, all of it.
[01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:48.720]  They don't want us discussing how it really works.
[01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:52.240]  They want us to find all the tentacles and all the hydra heads and not cut right down
[01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:53.240]  to the basics.
[01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:55.680]  Let's start over.
[01:36:55.680 --> 01:37:00.880]  All I'm saying is this, Kanye West, if he wants to come into the political where the
[01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:06.840]  knives are out, where Satan's walking around with his mask off, right, with his pants down,
[01:37:06.840 --> 01:37:09.200]  you know, taking a piss where he wants to.
[01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:10.200]  This is serious.
[01:37:10.200 --> 01:37:12.160]  There's no time for games here.
[01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:13.640]  This isn't a joke.
[01:37:13.640 --> 01:37:16.400]  And we show a lack of faith in God.
[01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:18.760]  We show a lack of spiritual.
[01:37:18.760 --> 01:37:26.740]  We show a lack of spiritual, let's say, fortitude when we believe that we have to resort to
[01:37:26.740 --> 01:37:31.560]  Satan's tactics in order to motivate and inspire a Christian faith that can combat
[01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:32.560]  him.
[01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:34.720]  Okay, that's my message to Kanye.
[01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:40.000]  If you want to come on and talk about Netanyahu or Satanic agendas or the contradictions that
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:44.280]  exist in the cultural ethos, whatever you want to talk about, do it.
[01:37:44.280 --> 01:37:46.240]  But do it with some seriousness.
[01:37:46.240 --> 01:37:51.120]  Do it with people who you actually have vetted and know aren't working for the very government
[01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:54.360]  that you say you're fighting against or the establishment you say you're fighting against.
[01:37:54.360 --> 01:37:56.000]  I don't know Nick Fuentes.
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:57.000]  I don't know Milo.
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:00.640]  I don't know any of these people, but all of them are in question right now.
[01:38:00.640 --> 01:38:02.560]  And it's not because of Kanye West.
[01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:08.240]  It's because I understand the scope with which the security state and the people who have
[01:38:08.240 --> 01:38:12.800]  mastered psychological manipulation on an intergenerational level play.
[01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:15.040]  I understand how these people play.
[01:38:15.040 --> 01:38:16.920]  I'm not sure that Kanye does.
[01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:22.000]  He has an intuition towards it, but the people that he's palling around with, I don't quite
[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:23.000]  understand.
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:24.000]  Right?
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:30.880]  I don't see how he can think that his trainer is a security state shield, but Nick Fuentes
[01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:32.560]  can be trusted.
[01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:34.600]  You know, don't trust me.
[01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:38.440]  You know how I can trust you, Alex, besides the fact that I know that you were bringing
[01:38:38.440 --> 01:38:42.360]  a story that nobody, a conversation that nobody else would bring.
[01:38:42.360 --> 01:38:46.720]  You know how I know I could trust you because the establishment doesn't try and sue you
[01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:53.080]  for 2.5 trillion unless you're a problem, unless you're dangerous, unless you're an
[01:38:53.080 --> 01:38:54.080]  enemy, right?
[01:38:54.080 --> 01:38:59.280]  A real enemy, not an established oppositional enemy, a real enemy.
[01:38:59.280 --> 01:39:02.680]  When they try and throw a person in, that's how you can sort it out.
[01:39:02.680 --> 01:39:12.120]  So my question for Kanye is, and this goes back to what I think we should focus on here.
[01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:16.720]  The story we were told is that we won World War II.
[01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:25.280]  We are caught up in a post-World War II victors and losers narrative.
[01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:27.520]  Nobody won World War II.
[01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:29.360]  There were no winners.
[01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:34.160]  There were soldiers that gave their life for an ideal that they thought that their overseers,
[01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:37.360]  that their managerial elite really believed in.
[01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:41.040]  But what we know of wars is that that's not always the case.
[01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:46.280]  There's tons of examples and situations where people who preside over us tell us one story
[01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:49.680]  and send us on a mission to execute their agenda.
[01:39:49.680 --> 01:39:52.920]  And by the way, Eisenhower and his federal address said that he said a technological
[01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:58.640]  elite is in control of military industrial complexes taken over.
[01:39:58.640 --> 01:40:01.000]  Nobody won World War II.
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:02.920]  There were no winners.
[01:40:02.920 --> 01:40:06.640]  There were two groups of people, and this is what happened in Germany.
[01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:11.320]  The fight between the fascists and the communists wasn't a fight of ideological difference.
[01:40:11.320 --> 01:40:13.520]  It was a fight of brand identity.
[01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:17.000]  It was a fight of the difference in brand identity.
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.320]  They're the exact same ideology.
[01:40:19.320 --> 01:40:24.280]  By the way, Stalin admired Hitler and even said that in public writings that Hitler was
[01:40:24.280 --> 01:40:28.520]  just a different brand and he was mad at his own generals that they couldn't be fancy and
[01:40:28.520 --> 01:40:31.640]  have great art and great architecture and great uniforms.
[01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:35.680]  He was mad that they couldn't be cool like Hitler.
[01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:38.520]  I'll show you the difference in ideology right here.
[01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:45.160]  The fascists, people think that Adolf Hitler was a nationalist.
[01:40:45.160 --> 01:40:47.760]  He was a globalist.
[01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:54.720]  He wanted Nazi Germany to run the world either directly or by proxy under a national banner.
[01:40:54.720 --> 01:40:59.680]  The communists wanted to do it through diversity, equity, and inclusion.
[01:40:59.680 --> 01:41:02.320]  Still totalitarian state power.
[01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:04.200]  It's the same scam.
[01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:09.160]  It's a merger of the state and the corporation and even more importantly, the medical and
[01:41:09.160 --> 01:41:11.440]  scientific elite.
[01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:17.320]  That's what communism and fascism and the trajectory towards fascism is always the same.
[01:41:17.320 --> 01:41:21.760]  Liberalism, then communism, then fascism.
[01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:23.760]  We have been duped at the highest level.
[01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:29.120]  Even us, within this intellectual political discussion, have a problem with cutting through
[01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:30.120]  the noise and getting to the cycle.
[01:41:30.120 --> 01:41:35.880]  You said, we're covering the central way the world really works.
[01:41:35.880 --> 01:41:36.880]  Elaborate on that because you're right.
[01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:39.080]  If you don't know that, you know nothing.
[01:41:39.080 --> 01:41:43.320]  Well, why when we're talking about World War II in school, we never learned about the
[01:41:43.320 --> 01:41:45.720]  Bretton Woods Conference?
[01:41:45.720 --> 01:41:49.120]  Why are we never learned how the world was actually realigned after World War II on
[01:41:49.120 --> 01:41:50.840]  an economic basis?
[01:41:50.840 --> 01:41:56.480]  Why were we never taught the Wall Street big finance companies or benefactors that invested
[01:41:56.480 --> 01:41:58.000]  in Nazi Germany?
[01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:03.640]  Why are we never taught the history of English and the England and Germany's relationship?
[01:42:03.640 --> 01:42:04.840]  There's a smoking gun.
[01:42:04.840 --> 01:42:05.840]  That's why.
[01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:06.840]  Right?
[01:42:06.840 --> 01:42:11.560]  And the real issue is that we all accepted at home, a lot of us accepted at home because
[01:42:11.560 --> 01:42:16.240]  they've perfected and mastered dopamine.
[01:42:16.240 --> 01:42:22.400]  You could argue that the entire scientific project, post World War II, was to make sure
[01:42:22.400 --> 01:42:27.240]  that people were so high with dopamine that they would never find the spirit to care enough
[01:42:27.240 --> 01:42:29.240]  about any of this.
[01:42:29.240 --> 01:42:32.640]  Explain, we're going to come back, explain dopamine, because all the studies with rats
[01:42:32.640 --> 01:42:38.600]  and pigeons and everything is, the clicks get us, you heard the Facebook whistleblowers
[01:42:38.600 --> 01:42:41.320]  come out and say, we're destroying people, it's a drug.
[01:42:41.320 --> 01:42:42.320]  They know what they're doing.
[01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:45.640]  We're all basically addicted to it and they know how to manipulate us, but we're not like
[01:42:45.640 --> 01:42:46.640]  other animals.
[01:42:46.640 --> 01:42:47.960]  We're able to control our environment.
[01:42:47.960 --> 01:42:48.960]  Royce White is on fire.
[01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:50.360]  I'm your host Alex Jones.

[01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:52.360]  Tomorrow's news today.

[01:42:55.680 --> 01:42:59.600]  He's on fire tonight.

[01:44:00.120 --> 01:44:05.520]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading
[01:44:05.520 --> 01:44:07.560]  a healthier life.
[01:44:07.560 --> 01:44:11.400]  Infowars has made it easier to make sure you're getting enough in your system with a supplement
[01:44:11.400 --> 01:44:13.040]  that contains both.
[01:44:13.040 --> 01:44:18.000]  This Infowars life offering vitamin C plus zinc with rose hips should be your next purchase
[01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:19.600]  from the Infowars store.
[01:44:19.600 --> 01:44:24.440]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that
[01:44:24.440 --> 01:44:27.120]  contain the rose plant seeds.
[01:44:27.120 --> 01:44:32.040]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions,
[01:44:32.040 --> 01:44:36.640]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have
[01:44:36.640 --> 01:44:37.640]  shown.
[01:44:37.640 --> 01:44:41.920]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important
[01:44:41.920 --> 01:44:46.520]  role in nutrition, immune defense and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[01:44:46.520 --> 01:44:51.640]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate, even in affluent populations
[01:44:51.640 --> 01:44:52.640]  like here in America.
[01:44:52.640 --> 01:44:57.440]  So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at Infowarsstore.com where we promise
[01:44:57.440 --> 01:44:59.600]  our rose hips don't lie.
[01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:05.520]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be
[01:45:05.520 --> 01:45:10.880]  allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:12.960]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:15.760]  That's what they want to take away, your ability to speak freely.
[01:45:15.760 --> 01:45:18.880]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next, or they're going to go for Steve Bannon, or
[01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:20.400]  they're going to go for Tucker Carlson.
[01:45:20.400 --> 01:45:24.560]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago, but only 28 years, and I knew they were planning
[01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:25.560]  all of this.
[01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:28.880]  And I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere, but I couldn't have done it without
[01:45:28.880 --> 01:45:29.880]  your support.
[01:45:29.880 --> 01:45:32.960]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, not
[01:45:32.960 --> 01:45:37.480]  just America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[01:45:37.480 --> 01:45:41.120]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful Infowars has been
[01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:42.800]  because of your past support.
[01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:46.600]  So I salute you and I thank you, and I ask you now, the critical juncture of the battle,
[01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:51.040]  every double your efforts of visiting infowarstore.com and getting amazing products that keep us
[01:45:51.040 --> 01:45:52.040]  on air.

[01:45:57.480 --> 01:45:59.480]  your support.
[01:45:59.480 --> 01:46:04.840]  The tip of the spear throughout this entire process, the only thing that made any Republican
[01:46:04.840 --> 01:46:06.440]  victories tonight possible.
[01:46:06.440 --> 01:46:10.640]  The only thing that made any resistance to the war machine possible.
[01:46:10.640 --> 01:46:15.480]  The only thing that made any opposition to the lockdowns and the mask mandates and the
[01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:21.240]  school shutdowns and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible, that made any
[01:46:21.240 --> 01:46:26.920]  resistance to it possible was people continuing to support Infowars, despite the massive
[01:46:26.920 --> 01:46:32.800]  lawfare being waged against Infowars, despite the media defamatory libelous campaign against
[01:46:32.800 --> 01:46:38.040]  Infowars, the ordinary people, the everyday people that buy products that make their own
[01:46:38.040 --> 01:46:43.520]  lives healthier, wealthier and wiser is what keeps Infowars on the air, and what that does
[01:46:43.520 --> 01:46:49.080]  is keep the populist message alive in an era and an age of totalitarian oppression.
[01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:55.160]  So continue to do it, go to places like infowarstore.com, go to places like Save Infowars, continue
[01:46:55.160 --> 01:47:00.960]  to keep Infowars alive because in the process you're keeping American liberty alive.
[01:47:00.960 --> 01:47:14.640]  Speaking of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:15.640]  Welcome back.
[01:47:15.640 --> 01:47:19.920]  So we think of wars as they were fought, the Civil War, World War I, World War II, but
[01:47:19.920 --> 01:47:25.640]  this is a scientific war against our genetics, our bodies, our minds, our dopamine receptors,
[01:47:25.640 --> 01:47:26.640]  how our brains work.
[01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:30.720]  And the globalists act like we're animals, they admit all this in all these white papers.
[01:47:30.720 --> 01:47:34.520]  And they say they're about to cull the earth to save the earth from us while they cut off
[01:47:34.520 --> 01:47:38.720]  our resources, but while they themselves, with all the genetic engineering and the rest
[01:47:38.720 --> 01:47:40.960]  of it, attack the earth itself.
[01:47:40.960 --> 01:47:46.360]  So Roy Swight, former NBA player, talk show host, run for Congress, I think you're a really
[01:47:46.360 --> 01:47:50.040]  smart guy, I really respect you, and you're an MMA fighter right now, but I think the
[01:47:50.040 --> 01:47:54.680]  most important work you're doing is happening on the show, and you've been really popular
[01:47:54.680 --> 01:47:58.280]  from years, been on Tucker Carlson, been on American shows years ago, but you're really
[01:47:58.280 --> 01:48:01.840]  exploding right now, and you're getting more hardcore, and that's great.
[01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:02.840]  How did you get educated?
[01:48:02.840 --> 01:48:03.840]  How did you get informed?
[01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:08.080]  I know you've been listening to me since high school, but how else did you get so dialed
[01:48:08.080 --> 01:48:09.080]  in on what's going on?
[01:48:09.080 --> 01:48:12.080]  Because what you're offering is the truth.
[01:48:12.080 --> 01:48:17.920]  Well, I was fortunate enough to be diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder at 16, 17
[01:48:17.920 --> 01:48:18.920]  years old.
[01:48:18.920 --> 01:48:24.200]  And at that time, I had to do my own independent research into the psychological data and all
[01:48:24.200 --> 01:48:30.760]  of the psychological studies that were being done to try and find some type of relief to
[01:48:30.760 --> 01:48:32.960]  what was two or three panic attacks a day.
[01:48:32.960 --> 01:48:37.320]  Now, many people were trying to use that exposed factor to discredit me like they would do
[01:48:37.320 --> 01:48:40.480]  you or anybody else and say, hey, this guy is mental health issue.
[01:48:40.480 --> 01:48:45.760]  So everything he's saying is a conspiracy, but really my anxiety was existential, it
[01:48:45.760 --> 01:48:48.840]  was spiritual, and I didn't really realize that at the time because-
[01:48:48.840 --> 01:48:53.840]  No, I agree, you didn't know, I'm interrupting, you didn't know your mission, and you instinctively
[01:48:53.840 --> 01:48:57.360]  spiritually knew there was a crisis, but as soon as you figured out the enemy, you got
[01:48:57.360 --> 01:48:58.920]  aligned and empowered.
[01:48:58.920 --> 01:48:59.920]  That's what happened to me.
[01:48:59.920 --> 01:49:02.160]  Is that what happened to you?
[01:49:02.160 --> 01:49:03.760]  Anxiety resolved.
[01:49:03.760 --> 01:49:04.760]  Anxiety resolved completely.
[01:49:04.760 --> 01:49:05.760]  Right?
[01:49:05.760 --> 01:49:08.560]  And once, once I, see what, what had happened was-
[01:49:08.560 --> 01:49:13.320]  I had nothing but anxiety till I got on mission at about 18 or 19, exactly.
[01:49:13.320 --> 01:49:17.120]  But once I got in alignment with the Holy Spirit that was driving me, it all ended.
[01:49:17.120 --> 01:49:18.120]  It's all right.
[01:49:18.120 --> 01:49:20.640]  I just wanted to, I wanted to, I wanted to take your thunder and let folks know this
[01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:21.640]  is universal.
[01:49:21.640 --> 01:49:25.040]  There's a lot of young men and women, particularly young men watching right now, that don't get
[01:49:25.040 --> 01:49:26.040]  this.
[01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:27.680]  You have anxiety because you're not on mission.
[01:49:27.680 --> 01:49:28.680]  Go ahead.
[01:49:28.680 --> 01:49:34.560]  Yeah, and, and at the time, you know, in order to become a high level basketball player,
[01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:39.840]  you sort of have to lose yourself in, in the brainwashing of eat, sleep, and breathe.
[01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:43.240]  Well, if you eat, sleep, and breathe basketball, you can't know Christ.
[01:49:43.240 --> 01:49:44.560]  You can't love Christ.
[01:49:44.560 --> 01:49:49.160]  You can't have a relationship with God, and the devil will use you and put you off on
[01:49:49.160 --> 01:49:52.760]  a track that will, that will lead you to do his bidding.
[01:49:52.760 --> 01:49:57.000]  And I was on that track and I felt the existential angst from that, the spiritual angst.
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:02.160]  And then once I pushed back against the MBA about mental health policy, it was the greatest
[01:50:02.160 --> 01:50:06.760]  gift I could ever had, it could have been given by God, and, and God is genius and,
[01:50:06.760 --> 01:50:11.120]  and working in that way that not only did I resolve my angst, but I was given an insight
[01:50:11.120 --> 01:50:12.120]  on the path.
[01:50:12.120 --> 01:50:13.120]  Right.
[01:50:13.120 --> 01:50:17.720]  And that insight was number one, there's a global corporatocracy and the MBA is a watering
[01:50:17.720 --> 01:50:19.680]  hole for the global corporatocracy.
[01:50:19.680 --> 01:50:20.920]  And I was right up close to it.
[01:50:20.920 --> 01:50:22.480]  I was behind closed doors.
[01:50:22.480 --> 01:50:24.240]  So that was your microcosm, exactly.
[01:50:24.240 --> 01:50:27.880]  You have anxiety, take, till you take Christ commission.
[01:50:27.880 --> 01:50:31.120]  Once that happened, the doors blow off, the windows blow open, and now you're given the
[01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:36.720]  sermon and the mission, and now you don't have any more anxiety, you just have victory.
[01:50:36.720 --> 01:50:44.040]  And I was also needing to look into the psychological data because of my, of, of, of the anxiety.
[01:50:44.040 --> 01:50:45.840]  And I became interested in mental health.
[01:50:45.840 --> 01:50:51.640]  I became interested in the human psychology and, and, and mostly my intuition was, what
[01:50:51.640 --> 01:50:54.960]  ways has this been weaponized that I don't yet understand?
[01:50:54.960 --> 01:51:01.360]  This was before, this was before big tech went green, you could say, went live, right?
[01:51:01.360 --> 01:51:04.960]  Before Skynet went live, this was like 2013.
[01:51:04.960 --> 01:51:11.000]  It wasn't until, you know, right around 2015, 16 that we saw the, the, the social media
[01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:12.000]  boom.
[01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:17.760]  But Skynet was turning on, and so was Royce White, I know, I've been on the same path.
[01:51:17.760 --> 01:51:18.920]  They were firing up their edges.
[01:51:18.920 --> 01:51:23.040]  God was firing up his absolutely.
[01:51:23.040 --> 01:51:29.720]  And what I, what I realized was that the biggest drug cartels today are not in Silicon Valley.
[01:51:29.720 --> 01:51:33.960]  I realized it back then, the biggest drug cartels were getting the lights turned on in
[01:51:33.960 --> 01:51:37.160]  Silicon Valley because they have the best drug on the market.
[01:51:37.160 --> 01:51:38.480]  They don't even have to ship it to you.
[01:51:38.480 --> 01:51:39.480]  It's already in your brain.
[01:51:39.480 --> 01:51:40.800]  Your body makes it.
[01:51:40.800 --> 01:51:45.320]  All they have to do is create the circumstance for it to activate, and that's what dopamine
[01:51:45.320 --> 01:51:46.320]  is.
[01:51:46.320 --> 01:51:50.480]  It's a neurotransmitter that's responsible for the, the feeling of pleasure, satisfaction
[01:51:50.480 --> 01:51:51.800]  and motivation.
[01:51:51.800 --> 01:51:58.040]  This is why big tech says openly, if they can have access to your data, they can literally
[01:51:58.040 --> 01:52:00.520]  manipulate you like a puppet.
[01:52:00.520 --> 01:52:05.520]  That data is the goal of tomorrow for this reason, because dopamine is the best mechanism
[01:52:05.520 --> 01:52:11.160]  to predict human behavior, right, and, and especially human behavior in a, in a morally
[01:52:11.160 --> 01:52:16.520]  bankrupt, spiritually bankrupt, radical material society.
[01:52:16.520 --> 01:52:20.360]  Keep laying on, keep laying, laying on us, brother.
[01:52:20.360 --> 01:52:21.360]  Um, yeah.
[01:52:21.360 --> 01:52:26.600]  And, and so, you know, the, the dopamine project is, is sort of, you could, this is why I say
[01:52:26.600 --> 01:52:32.800]  that, um, the Nazis are still running the machine, right, this, this is a form of Nazis.
[01:52:32.800 --> 01:52:40.160]  You could argue that big tech, that a sort of centralized, uh, uh, coagulation of power
[01:52:40.160 --> 01:52:46.520]  in a, in a, in a technocratic manner is the wet dream of Nazis, right?
[01:52:46.520 --> 01:52:49.960]  This would have been the wet dream of, of, of, of the Nazi scientists.
[01:52:49.960 --> 01:52:51.760]  It is the wet dream of the Nazi scientists.
[01:52:51.760 --> 01:52:54.000]  They're the ones who helped us create it, right?
[01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:58.800]  And we took it as some, you know, we lied to us, all free markets and enterprise and
[01:52:58.800 --> 01:53:02.880]  yeah, yeah, yeah, connectivity, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, all scam.
[01:53:02.880 --> 01:53:03.880]  Look at the results.
[01:53:03.880 --> 01:53:08.200]  You judge a, a tree by its fruit, you, you, you're, you're as good as your score says
[01:53:08.200 --> 01:53:09.200]  you are.
[01:53:09.200 --> 01:53:13.080]  And what our score says we are, especially when it comes to tech and social media is
[01:53:13.080 --> 01:53:17.840]  that it's a fast track, a highway to hell, a highway to Satan, a highway to lose one
[01:53:17.840 --> 01:53:19.560]  sense of themselves.
[01:53:19.560 --> 01:53:24.240]  And that takes us right back to IBM and the holler with punch cards machines.
[01:53:24.240 --> 01:53:26.400]  Absolutely they are reducing us down to a number.
[01:53:26.400 --> 01:53:33.360]  And it was the DARPA Nazis with the intergalactic communication network in the 1960s.
[01:53:33.360 --> 01:53:37.200]  That was the mind control system and the whole plan for the internet.
[01:53:37.200 --> 01:53:42.760]  100% 100% This is, this is a Nazi project.
[01:53:42.760 --> 01:53:45.280]  This is, this is what the, this is what the outcome.
[01:53:45.280 --> 01:53:51.360]  This is the moral hazard from a, from a country, a nation, a populace, let's not take the,
[01:53:51.360 --> 01:53:53.280]  the responsibility off of ourselves.
[01:53:53.280 --> 01:53:59.320]  A populace that was told a story and we were so absorbed with the idea of victory.
[01:53:59.320 --> 01:54:04.120]  Let's go back to dopamine on that, that the idea of achievement, right?
[01:54:04.120 --> 01:54:06.800]  That's dopamine, that achievement transmitter.
[01:54:06.800 --> 01:54:08.080]  We were so caught up in that.
[01:54:08.080 --> 01:54:12.520]  And then given the radical materialism that we never stopped to think, Hey, what's the
[01:54:12.520 --> 01:54:16.480]  moral implication of us using Nazi technology?
[01:54:16.480 --> 01:54:20.960]  So what is the answer Roy Swight to counter this, awaken to the mechanism, become aware
[01:54:20.960 --> 01:54:25.480]  of it, educate others and, and say no to it and wean ourselves off the drug.
[01:54:25.480 --> 01:54:27.800]  But how do we use the mechanism they built?
[01:54:27.800 --> 01:54:32.720]  How do we fight the matrix where Neo still has to plug into it to fight it?
[01:54:32.720 --> 01:54:36.960]  Well, the number one thing the internet did for us to show us the lies.
[01:54:36.960 --> 01:54:39.960]  I think the number one way to use it is to tell the truth.
[01:54:39.960 --> 01:54:46.320]  And I think there needs to be a widespread dogmatic effort to tell the truth using the
[01:54:46.320 --> 01:54:47.320]  internet.
[01:54:47.320 --> 01:54:48.320]  I agree.
[01:54:48.320 --> 01:54:53.200]  We're panicking because they thought it was theirs, we've been taken away from them.
[01:54:53.200 --> 01:54:54.800]  And it will continue.
[01:54:54.800 --> 01:54:57.640]  And that is why you see the effort to censor.
[01:54:57.640 --> 01:54:59.520]  That is why you see the effort to silence.
[01:54:59.520 --> 01:55:04.480]  That is why you see the effort to ban people from the internet is because this is ours.
[01:55:04.480 --> 01:55:05.480]  This is for us.
[01:55:05.480 --> 01:55:06.600]  This was for us to brainwash.
[01:55:06.600 --> 01:55:11.800]  It was never intended for you people to be able to have a ministry of truth, to have
[01:55:11.800 --> 01:55:14.000]  a sermon, to speak the gospel.
[01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:17.840]  That was never, that was never the intent, right, especially not to combat what we're
[01:55:17.840 --> 01:55:18.840]  trying to do.
[01:55:18.840 --> 01:55:22.360]  And if you look at China, you see, I mean, think about this.
[01:55:22.360 --> 01:55:28.400]  Everybody wants to skip over the central, you know, the beginning.
[01:55:28.400 --> 01:55:32.000]  What's the connection between the CCP and the anti-Jews?
[01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:36.040]  And I do call them anti-Jews because I don't believe that they're real Jews.
[01:55:36.040 --> 01:55:37.320]  And it's not because of their race.
[01:55:37.320 --> 01:55:39.120]  And that's another trip up that we make.
[01:55:39.120 --> 01:55:44.480]  All of these real far right white supremacists that believe in race first, race superiority,
[01:55:44.480 --> 01:55:45.480]  that's Darwinism.
[01:55:45.480 --> 01:55:49.520]  If you believe in the evolution, the theory of evolution, you're a Satanist.
[01:55:49.520 --> 01:55:51.360]  That was the, that was the railhead of Satanism.
[01:55:51.360 --> 01:55:54.360]  The admitted root of Nazism is Darwinism.
[01:55:54.360 --> 01:55:58.640]  And the left worships Darwinism, as you said, 45 minutes ago at the start of the interview,
[01:55:58.640 --> 01:56:00.720]  the left are the original Nazis.
[01:56:00.720 --> 01:56:01.920]  Absolutely.
[01:56:01.920 --> 01:56:10.680]  So what I'm saying is when you, when you look at where we are right now, the best thing
[01:56:10.680 --> 01:56:15.880]  we can do, the best thing we can hope for is to start to tell the truth about these issues.
[01:56:15.880 --> 01:56:19.520]  What's the connection between the CCP and the anti-Jews?
[01:56:19.520 --> 01:56:20.520]  Communism.
[01:56:20.520 --> 01:56:26.480]  Karl Marx, he was a, he was a German anti-Jews dad, his dad's dad was, comes from a family
[01:56:26.480 --> 01:56:27.480]  of rabbis.
[01:56:27.480 --> 01:56:28.480]  He rejects God.
[01:56:28.480 --> 01:56:31.040]  He becomes, comes with the communist manifesto.
[01:56:31.040 --> 01:56:35.640]  It goes across many revolutionary efforts, lands itself in communist China.
[01:56:35.640 --> 01:56:36.840]  That's who we're fighting today.
[01:56:36.840 --> 01:56:37.840]  What's the common thread?
[01:56:37.840 --> 01:56:40.640]  They don't believe in God.
[01:56:40.640 --> 01:56:42.800]  They don't believe in God.
[01:56:42.800 --> 01:56:44.040]  They think they're God.
[01:56:44.040 --> 01:56:45.600]  Roy Swight, you always blow me away.
[01:56:45.600 --> 01:56:47.720]  I got really good gut level feelings about you.
[01:56:47.720 --> 01:56:50.040]  So I learned about you four or five years ago.
[01:56:50.040 --> 01:56:51.920]  It's always blessed to have you.
[01:56:51.920 --> 01:56:52.920]  Get with my producers.
[01:56:52.920 --> 01:56:54.680]  Come on for a couple hours this week.
[01:56:54.680 --> 01:56:55.680]  Talk for an hour.
[01:56:55.680 --> 01:56:56.680]  Take calls.
[01:56:56.680 --> 01:56:57.680]  We love you.
[01:56:57.680 --> 01:56:58.680]  Roy Swight.
[01:56:58.680 --> 01:56:59.680]  Find you everywhere.
[01:56:59.680 --> 01:57:00.680]  Take care, brother.
[01:57:00.680 --> 01:57:01.680]  Godspeed, brother.
[01:57:01.680 --> 01:57:02.680]  That was powerful.
[01:57:02.680 --> 01:57:05.600]  That was very real.
[01:57:05.600 --> 01:57:06.880]  This is all very real.
[01:57:06.880 --> 01:57:08.000]  I care about the future.
[01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:09.000]  I care about children.
[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.760]  I care about you no matter what color you are.
[01:57:11.760 --> 01:57:13.000]  We got to wake up, folks.
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:14.000]  We're going to do it together.
[01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:15.000]  We're going to go to break.
[01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.440]  Owen Shroyer is loaded.
[01:57:17.440 --> 01:57:19.800]  Tons of clips, tons of news, tons of calls.
[01:57:19.800 --> 01:57:20.800]  It's all coming up.
[01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:23.080]  Owen Shroyer from 6 to 8 p.m.
[01:57:23.080 --> 01:57:24.080]  Central.
[01:57:24.080 --> 01:57:26.440]  It's 5.57 and 18 seconds here.
[01:57:26.440 --> 01:57:31.560]  We're about to end this transmission and I'll be back tomorrow at 11 a.m. Central right
[01:57:31.560 --> 01:57:37.080]  after American Journal with the great Harrison Smith, 8 a.m. at infowars.com.
[01:57:37.080 --> 01:57:38.680]  Join him and share that link.
[01:57:38.680 --> 01:57:40.240]  That's how we overpower the evil.
[01:57:40.240 --> 01:57:41.240]  All of us together.
[01:57:41.240 --> 01:57:42.240]  Share the links.
[01:57:42.240 --> 01:57:43.240]  infowars.com.
[01:57:43.240 --> 01:57:44.440]  Band out video.
[01:57:44.440 --> 01:57:49.280]  We can do it together, but it's up to you.
[01:57:49.280 --> 01:57:54.920]  December 2022 is here and we are proud and very excited to announce that free shipping
[01:57:54.920 --> 01:57:57.800]  is back at infowarstore.com.
[01:57:57.800 --> 01:57:58.800]  That's right.
[01:57:58.800 --> 01:58:01.680]  Free shipping on all orders of $50 or more.
[01:58:01.680 --> 01:58:07.240]  But we've signed a new deal with a big national shipping company and they're able to cut our
[01:58:07.240 --> 01:58:10.640]  regular shipping cost by up to 50%.
[01:58:10.640 --> 01:58:15.160]  So that means even on orders that are below $50, you're going to be paying way lower than
[01:58:15.160 --> 01:58:16.920]  you were previously.
[01:58:16.920 --> 01:58:17.920]  This is a game changer.
[01:58:17.920 --> 01:58:19.840]  We're so excited about it.
[01:58:19.840 --> 01:58:21.800]  Our listeners have really asked for free shipping again.
[01:58:21.800 --> 01:58:26.040]  We couldn't afford it before, but by moving to a bigger national distributor, we're able
[01:58:26.040 --> 01:58:27.040]  to do it.
[01:58:27.040 --> 01:58:32.120]  So now your orders will be shipped even faster, the same great customer service and more.
[01:58:32.120 --> 01:58:38.160]  So get huge discounts and free shipping on so many great items at infowarstore.com right
[01:58:38.160 --> 01:58:39.160]  now.
[01:58:39.160 --> 01:58:42.200]  I want to thank you all for your support, but now there's no excuse to boost your immune
[01:58:42.200 --> 01:58:49.240]  system, lead a healthier life and keep infowars on the air, infowars.com.
