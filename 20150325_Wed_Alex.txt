[00:56.320 --> 01:00.640]  having a difficult time separating aerial drone photography from actual
[01:00.640 --> 01:05.760]  commercial use one thing the FAA seems to have a clear understanding of is
[01:05.760 --> 01:12.280]  Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos intent to fill our skies 400 feet or below with drones
[01:12.280 --> 01:17.920]  whizzing packages to Amazon's prime members Amazon has been awarded the FAA's

[02:22.760 --> 02:27.640]  drones with more than surveillance cameras as if that's not bad enough should
[02:27.640 --> 02:31.840]  we expect that the drones that will be flying over our neighborhoods would be
[02:31.840 --> 02:36.680]  armed with machine guns and missiles you may ask how predator drones that kill

[03:10.280 --> 03:14.360]  groundwork to normalize the use of drones in the United States and the
[03:14.360 --> 03:19.080]  Justice Department has provided the quasi legal groundwork for their use in

[07:59.360 --> 08:05.400]  ladies and gentlemen we are live on this Wednesday the 25th day of March 2015 we
[08:05.400 --> 08:10.480]  have an unprecedentedly important transmission going out worldwide this
[08:10.480 --> 08:14.880]  broadcast is countering the corporatist that are anti-free market that are
[08:14.880 --> 08:20.160]  establishing the first planetary cashless society world government built
[08:20.160 --> 08:26.680]  around eugenics humanity has faced attempts at domination has faced corrupt
[08:26.680 --> 08:32.400]  empires but now for the first time since the days of Alexander the Great
[08:32.400 --> 08:39.600]  elites have a real shot at global domination and planetary rule and in
[08:39.600 --> 08:45.400]  this new system the elite want to dominate the individual's mind and soul
[08:45.400 --> 08:54.120]  itself it is full spectrum dominance it is global domination is the u.s.
[08:54.120 --> 09:00.120]  involved with any procuring of weapons transfer of weapons buying selling
[09:00.120 --> 09:10.840]  anyhow transferring weapons to turkey out of Libya to turkey it is a big idea a
[09:10.840 --> 09:16.160]  new world order how is it that this organization is so well funded so
[09:16.160 --> 09:19.560]  organized Lamik state linked militants have gained a stronger
[09:19.560 --> 09:23.920]  foothold in Libya seizing new economically vital areas of the country
[09:23.920 --> 09:29.720]  the leader of ISIS in Libya is none other than Abdul Hakim Beltaj and of
[09:29.720 --> 09:34.520]  course he was on to the teeth by NATO a world in which there is the very real
[09:34.520 --> 09:38.320]  prospect of a new world order the Russians say they're negotiating with
[09:38.320 --> 09:42.560]  North Korea to hold joint military exercise Kim Jong-un and Vladimir
[09:42.560 --> 09:47.040]  Putin teaming up creating an ominous alliance against the United States
[09:47.040 --> 09:51.240]  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is aggressively opposing the
[09:51.240 --> 09:55.720]  nuclear deal that the u.s. government is negotiating with Iran Saudi Arabia is
[09:55.720 --> 09:59.640]  apparently prepared to allow Israeli jets into its airspace to conduct attacks
[09:59.640 --> 10:05.040]  on Iran we have an unprecedented opportunity to build a new world order
[10:05.040 --> 10:11.640]  I set up a foundation in Ukraine and created an important part in events now
[10:11.640 --> 10:15.240]  Ukraine is set to receive the first tranche of the International Monetary
[10:15.240 --> 10:20.520]  Fund aid package where we had broker the deal to transition power in Ukraine
[10:20.520 --> 10:28.360]  Vladimir Putin is on the move only when this transformation is complete will we
[10:28.360 --> 10:34.560]  be able to take full measure of the opportunities presented by this new and
[10:34.560 --> 10:39.960]  involving world order is known as the Bilderberg group could their objective
[10:39.960 --> 10:43.240]  be world domination
[10:51.760 --> 10:59.640]  ladies and gentlemen the globalists are manipulating world events to bring in
[10:59.640 --> 11:07.200]  planetary crises so that they can sell the idea of open world government this
[11:07.200 --> 11:11.240]  is what comes out of Davos Switzerland what the Financial Times of London is
[11:11.240 --> 11:15.760]  openly admitting what CNBC is admitting what Brzezinski wrote last year in his
[11:15.760 --> 11:21.040]  new best-selling book it's what David Rockefeller's talking about that's why
[11:21.040 --> 11:27.440]  the elite is funding al Qaeda and ISIS and others at the same time these elite
[11:27.440 --> 11:32.200]  groups are making hundreds of billions of dollars globally a year out of
[11:32.200 --> 11:36.800]  military contracts and private contracts to counter the very threats that they
[11:36.800 --> 11:44.640]  are initiating problem reaction solution but if we blame the military or we
[11:44.640 --> 11:49.520]  blame the government or we even blame the average IRS agent we are falling into
[11:49.520 --> 11:53.240]  the new world order plan they plan to bring this country down and every other
[11:53.240 --> 11:56.840]  sovereign nation when they're done after they have the nation states already
[11:56.840 --> 12:00.080]  controlled by the globalist already under global government via treaty
[12:00.080 --> 12:05.520]  carrying out the planetary takeover then the individual nations and capitalism
[12:05.520 --> 12:09.960]  gets the blame our military gets the blame when we paid for it and go
[12:09.960 --> 12:14.040]  bankrupt under it and then won't even give the veterans the health care to take
[12:14.040 --> 12:20.280]  care of them the war against sovereign nations is about destroying sovereign
[12:20.280 --> 12:24.000]  nations when they fight each other it's about bankrupting us it's about
[12:24.000 --> 12:28.520]  degrading us it's about breaking down our culture and our society and that's
[12:28.520 --> 12:34.280]  exactly what everybody can see has now happened here the Christ sees the
[12:34.280 --> 12:39.120]  intensification of the destabilization is only going to be accelerating from
[12:39.120 --> 12:43.360]  this point out but here's the good news
[12:43.360 --> 12:48.000]  historians social engineers psych warfare chiefs they've all written in
[12:48.000 --> 12:50.960]  public books and documents that we've reviewed here on air and made films
[12:50.960 --> 12:56.200]  about that there are times of intense change when the global engineers will
[12:56.200 --> 13:05.720]  unfreeze societal systems and then during that fluctuating elastic period that
[13:05.720 --> 13:11.640]  liquid period that gaseous period they will attempt to rearrange things but
[13:11.640 --> 13:19.000]  during the flux during this this this time of change if we get involved we
[13:19.000 --> 13:24.640]  can move things just as easy or easier as they can the problem is the
[13:24.640 --> 13:30.240]  individual and the freedom lover never desires to be in control never desires
[13:30.240 --> 13:37.040]  to be involved because we're loners and so the collectivist team up and organize
[13:37.040 --> 13:45.120]  and are beating us on every front because we do not seek power well if we
[13:45.120 --> 13:49.080]  don't want to be slaves we're going to have to engage the enemy we're going to
[13:49.080 --> 13:52.920]  have to get very aggressive with them and I've been doing this 20 plus years
[13:52.920 --> 13:58.000]  let me tell you they're scared of us they shake in fear corrupt congressman
[13:58.000 --> 14:03.280]  mayors justice department officials I've confronted Janet Reno Hillary Clinton
[14:03.280 --> 14:11.200]  personally FB corrupt FBI agents involved in Waco they shake when they
[14:11.200 --> 14:14.560]  know that you're aware of what's going on and you see through the matrix and you
[14:14.560 --> 14:18.680]  understand the larger plan because most of them are just mercenaries who are
[14:18.680 --> 14:23.160]  scared themselves and you'll find out later don't like what they're involved
[14:23.160 --> 14:26.680]  in and they'll pull you aside and say listen I'm scared you don't know what
[14:26.680 --> 14:36.600]  they've got on us and what they do so it is a house of cards it is a giant game
[14:36.600 --> 14:41.080]  of thrones where the elite are manipulating the different capitals of
[14:41.080 --> 14:47.680]  the world and individuals against each other and it's so obvious now I want to
[14:47.680 --> 14:52.000]  open the phones up today ahead of Sheriff Richard Mack the guy that shot down
[14:52.000 --> 14:54.800]  the Brady Bill the guy that founded the Constitutional Sheriff's Association
[14:54.800 --> 15:00.520]  that Sheriff Clark and Wisconsin and many others are part of it is a real
[15:00.520 --> 15:05.440]  bulwark against tyranny and he's developed a plan and a program with the
[15:05.440 --> 15:10.480]  late Jack Mclam and others that knew we had to reach out to police that has
[15:10.480 --> 15:14.640]  been very successful in not letting them basically start a civil war in this
[15:14.640 --> 15:18.880]  country and has created a major backstop against the ADL and Southern
[15:18.880 --> 15:24.240]  Poverty Law Center seditious foreign funded operations to globalize and
[15:24.240 --> 15:30.040]  federalize the police and basically start a purge against real Americans so
[15:30.040 --> 15:33.240]  we're going to be talking to him in the second hour we'll have open phones it's
[15:33.240 --> 15:36.880]  going to be on the same topic we normally open the phones up for military
[15:36.880 --> 15:43.360]  active duty or former military veterans on big military issues and I haven't done
[15:43.360 --> 15:52.360]  that since Jade Helm broke over the weekend and so I want to open the phones
[15:52.360 --> 15:58.480]  up specifically to active duty but also police but also emergency managers you
[15:58.480 --> 16:03.760]  name it anybody connected into the Homeland Security takeover of all the
[16:03.760 --> 16:12.320]  major agencies and the expansion of these military drills more states added
[16:12.320 --> 16:16.200]  to Jade Helm military exercise realistic military training exercise
[16:16.200 --> 16:22.240]  expands to as many as 10 states it's now expanded we'll tell you about that
[16:22.240 --> 16:27.040]  that story is linked on drudgereport.com there's another report let's
[16:27.040 --> 16:31.040]  stop living in fairyland this is training to condition the public to
[16:31.040 --> 16:36.200]  accept military on the streets a Max Slavo article detailing the video that
[16:36.200 --> 16:42.920]  I shot a few days ago showing the facts now let's be clear about what's
[16:42.920 --> 16:54.040]  happening here the Pentagon military.com the Army Times stars and stripes vice
[16:54.040 --> 16:58.880]  and now hundreds of other publications it's hundreds I get the Google alerts
[16:58.880 --> 17:02.960]  when my name or info wars is in there it's in the hundreds in the last six
[17:02.960 --> 17:09.560]  seven days have come out and said Alex Jones says that the US Army and South
[17:09.560 --> 17:15.680]  com with the Marines and Delta Force and the Navy SEALs are going to take
[17:15.680 --> 17:23.280]  over and have a coup d'etat in Texas and Utah no one ever said that in any of
[17:23.280 --> 17:27.120]  the press reports we put out any of the videos this is how they change the
[17:27.120 --> 17:30.800]  subject with deception and they're unified in it and by the way it's not
[17:30.800 --> 17:34.680]  working you go to YouTube videos we've got with you know 200 300,000 views on
[17:34.680 --> 17:40.200]  this subject and you'll have 97% of the people thumbs up in it and disagreeing
[17:40.200 --> 17:44.920]  with the psyops trolls and if you go to vice and if you go to stars and stripes
[17:44.920 --> 17:49.720]  and if you go to army times in the comments most people are not buying it
[17:49.720 --> 17:54.520]  you got the classic troll comments about where a tinfoil hat you know blah blah
[17:54.520 --> 17:58.240]  Alex Jones is a cook and people under it go hey you got some of the biggest
[17:58.240 --> 18:03.000]  military exercises ever in conus continental US you've got the military
[18:03.000 --> 18:07.400]  openly training for gun confiscation you've got all these drills brigade
[18:07.400 --> 18:11.920]  homeland and this is how they deceive they point out in one news article that
[18:11.920 --> 18:16.360]  oh Alex says they're taking over this summer but then as a source he shows a
[18:16.360 --> 18:23.920]  2010 article out of the army times about brigade homeland well it's tour ended a
[18:23.920 --> 18:30.280]  year later that tour and they basically quadrupled the size after it I mean they
[18:30.280 --> 18:35.160]  try incredible deception where they go look he said this was a takeover and it
[18:35.160 --> 18:40.840]  didn't happen and brigade homeland is tour ended that's like saying we're not
[18:40.840 --> 18:45.320]  in Afghanistan because a tour ended 10 years ago yeah there was another tour a
[18:45.320 --> 18:51.120]  bigger one after that so they play these semantical games and you can really
[18:51.120 --> 18:54.640]  learn a lot watching it because it's all based on people not paying attention
[18:54.640 --> 18:58.200]  second that intro piece that Rob Jacobson put together Hillary gets asked
[18:58.200 --> 19:02.080]  about Benghazi weapons being shipped to Turkey which is now known and she goes
[19:02.080 --> 19:07.440]  a turkey knowing viewers out there most of them would go who don't even know
[19:07.440 --> 19:12.080]  there's a country called Turkey the former sea of the Ottoman Empire

[36:28.000 --> 36:33.920]  and and there's all these movies and and all these TV shows promoting nukes go
[36:33.920 --> 36:38.800]  off and then they bring in foreign UN troops to stabilize America shows like
[36:38.800 --> 36:43.120]  Jericho you name it it's all conditioning people say but Jericho was
[36:43.120 --> 36:46.600]  where private contractors did it to bring in martial law it exposed that it
[36:46.600 --> 36:52.680]  was bad but it still prepares the subconscious for it to unfold and as
[36:52.680 --> 36:57.040]  Joel Scalzen has said they have a plan to trick Russia or China into attacking
[36:57.040 --> 37:02.160]  us to try to survive that attack and then a fascist state will grow out of it
[37:02.160 --> 37:10.440]  well that is an insane plan but it's a recap and a retread of things that have
[37:10.440 --> 37:16.960]  gone on before that we have seen where LL Lemnister the chairman of the Joint
[37:16.960 --> 37:23.800]  Chiefs of Staff and his number two guy General LeMay Curtis LeMay wanted to
[37:23.800 --> 37:27.000]  have nuclear war and try to survive it and then create a global government
[37:27.000 --> 37:32.240]  out of that it's insane but the types of people that get into power at those
[37:32.240 --> 37:37.880]  levels historically lust after global domination and you could argue because
[37:37.880 --> 37:41.040]  the spirit of the devil wants level domination and through these people
[37:41.040 --> 37:45.960]  possesses them to risk everything to set up the planetary government and then
[37:45.960 --> 37:50.600]  throughout that process the planet could be destroyed but whether you believe in
[37:50.600 --> 37:56.120]  the devil or not this archetypal manifestation did you guys find it we're
[37:56.120 --> 38:01.440]  gonna play in a moment this archetypal manifestation is the devil by any other
[38:01.440 --> 38:09.560]  name the toll-free number to get active duty or recently retired or more
[38:09.560 --> 38:13.120]  military folks if you were longtime retired but I'd love to hear from
[38:13.120 --> 38:19.840]  military people who are around in the late 90s when Clinton actually had the
[38:19.840 --> 38:23.320]  Delta Force and others going into hundreds of departments hundreds and
[38:23.320 --> 38:27.760]  hundreds I mean it was 50 or 60 in Texas including Austin and Travis County
[38:27.760 --> 38:30.960]  and saying we want to give you money want you to be secretly part of the
[38:30.960 --> 38:35.840]  Pentagon and it was really to compromise you $200,000 per police chief and I had
[38:35.840 --> 38:40.400]  Ali Philippus chief police on that video interviews on YouTube I made films
[38:40.400 --> 38:47.040]  about it it's a long-term plan Clinton didn't get what he wanted but he was
[38:47.040 --> 38:50.480]  thinking about a false flag to bring in total martial on gun confiscation in a
[38:50.480 --> 39:00.440]  civil war and basically beyond Delta Force they've got huge brigade after
[39:00.440 --> 39:05.320]  brigade and we're talking about tens of thousands of soldiers that are mainly
[39:05.320 --> 39:10.120]  non-commissioned officers who've been in 10-15 years who have shown they'll do
[39:10.120 --> 39:13.560]  things that are ruthless in justifies the means they're always given a false
[39:13.560 --> 39:16.040]  end to believe they're doing the right thing most of them are pretty good
[39:16.040 --> 39:21.920]  people who will do just horrible stuff torture kill deal drugs launder money you
[39:21.920 --> 39:25.440]  name it they're into it and they've got a huge group of these people here in the
[39:25.440 --> 39:29.840]  United States that are corrupting our police departments corrupting our
[39:29.840 --> 39:34.640]  governments paying them off and then recruiting people under them for this
[39:34.640 --> 39:39.720]  internal coup of America and it's been a long-term project like the Manhattan
[39:39.720 --> 39:43.320]  project and I'm basically here exposing this but I told you about
[39:43.320 --> 39:46.480]  militarization police 20 years ago I told you about the plan for gun
[39:46.480 --> 39:50.040]  confiscation I told you about the PDDs I told you about all these different
[39:50.040 --> 39:55.000]  plans now we're far down the rat hole and they're now want to do 10 state not
[39:55.000 --> 40:01.400]  eight-state giant drills with plain clothes doing quote suspicious things
[40:01.400 --> 40:05.080]  and and in practicing taking over local government practicing taking out
[40:05.080 --> 40:09.400]  civilians and snatch and grabs and of course it has dual applications for
[40:09.400 --> 40:16.080]  overseas but the main mission is a psyop and they've countered us with deception
[40:16.080 --> 40:26.840]  the toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231-800-259-9231
[40:26.840 --> 40:31.480]  here's just one of the video games out there conditioning the public for the
[40:31.480 --> 40:36.200]  breakup of the United States here it is following a disputed election and a tie
[40:36.200 --> 40:41.440]  vote the US Congress installs the most unpopular president in US history as
[40:41.440 --> 40:47.000]  David Jefferson Adams becomes the 44th president of the United States shortly
[40:47.000 --> 40:50.960]  after the election increased unrest rioting and a growing number of
[40:50.960 --> 40:56.560]  militias have given rise to ever-increasing domestic terrorism in
[40:56.560 --> 41:00.560]  response the president invokes the homeland security act and declares
[41:00.560 --> 41:04.800]  martial law on the west coast and other areas of the country though highly
[41:04.800 --> 41:09.000]  contested a supreme court ruling sidesteps the electoral process
[41:09.000 --> 41:13.920]  disqualifying popular presidential candidates from several states public
[41:13.920 --> 41:18.200]  outrage explodes when a sham election leads to incumbent David Adams
[41:18.200 --> 41:24.560]  accepting a second term in office during the 57th inauguration day
[41:24.560 --> 41:30.440]  ceremonies Washington DC is struck by a low-yield nuclear weapon killing David
[41:30.440 --> 41:37.680]  Adams and most of the US Congress the destruction of Washington DC effectively
[41:37.680 --> 41:42.520]  breaks the chain of succession sending the nation into chaos in an emergency
[41:42.520 --> 41:48.160]  vote the European Union deploys peace keepers in the greater DC area to secure
[41:48.160 --> 41:54.120]  international interest with separatist sentiment rising California's
[41:54.120 --> 42:00.000]  governor declares home rule and secedes from the Union Texas follows
[42:00.000 --> 42:04.720]  quickly and declares sovereignty taking neighboring states with them and forming
[42:04.720 --> 42:10.000]  the Republic of Texas
[42:10.000 --> 42:18.600]  the once United States of America lie in ruin the time for words has passed and
[42:18.600 --> 42:24.400]  the second American Civil War now erupts as seven factions wage war across the
[42:24.400 --> 42:33.400]  land they back up on another to reclaim a mission to restore peace to rebuild
[42:33.400 --> 42:37.840]  this shattered union
[42:41.920 --> 42:49.760]  for 2005 we sort of covering in 2007 there have been countless countless
[42:49.760 --> 42:55.320]  similar things out there preparing and conditioning the public and there are
[42:55.320 --> 42:58.720]  different interests fighting for control of this Republic because this
[42:58.720 --> 43:06.160]  Republic's wealth and will built the new global government but we are to be
[43:06.160 --> 43:12.720]  betrayed in the end you can see the nature of the globalist so again I want
[43:12.720 --> 43:22.400]  to hear from veterans active duty police on Jade Helm now being expanded to
[43:22.400 --> 43:31.720]  other states 800 2599 231 but speaking of the escalation with Russia US House
[43:31.720 --> 43:38.240]  votes 348 48 to arm Ukraine Russia warns lethal aid will explode the whole
[43:38.240 --> 43:43.840]  situation Russia of course threatening these nuclear weapons repeatedly in the
[43:43.840 --> 43:53.960]  last two weeks while ISIS and al Qaeda take over areas of Tunisia Libya Iraq
[43:53.960 --> 44:02.600]  Turkey Syria it's just over the top so I thought I'd play the end of Planet of
[44:02.600 --> 44:09.760]  the Apes with Charlton Heston where he's riding up and I'll narrate as we play
[44:09.760 --> 44:16.880]  the clip and he sees the Statue of Liberty sunken halfway into the sand
[44:16.880 --> 44:26.600]  with its spikes melted they really did it they probably won't
[44:26.600 --> 44:49.520]  type finally really didn't just love Charlton Heston I don't think that's
[44:49.520 --> 44:57.320]  blasphemy of a nuclear planet I think they probably will be doomed and don't
[44:57.320 --> 45:04.080]  think they won't do it no one's really worried about a nuclear war now back when
[45:04.080 --> 45:06.400]  we were really worried about when people wouldn't get up on TV and say we
[45:06.400 --> 45:09.520]  ought to kill all bunch of Russians around their doorstep that'll teach
[45:09.520 --> 45:13.280]  them can kill some Russians we'll just sweep them aside and they'll just lay
[45:13.280 --> 45:20.920]  down and take it I'm I'm general scales and then you've got all these weird
[45:20.920 --> 45:25.080]  feminists running the State Department and basically the Pentagon now who never
[45:25.080 --> 45:32.200]  even been in the military I mean that sounds like a recipe for disaster all
[45:32.200 --> 45:35.960]  the military people I know that have actually been in heavy combat are
[45:35.960 --> 45:39.240]  absolutely freaked out and concerned because they understand the real world
[45:39.240 --> 45:43.080]  but all these people that have never actually been in combat or actually seen
[45:43.080 --> 45:47.000]  people die in mass just think it's all fun is they just sit back and play God
[45:47.000 --> 45:54.880]  I want to go to Michael active duty in South Dakota John and Maryland on the
[45:54.880 --> 46:00.840]  military training and a lot of other folks but we're seeing the sad story of
[46:00.840 --> 46:05.520]  domestic psyops where they attack us in vice and they attack us in the Army
[46:05.520 --> 46:08.680]  Times and they attack us in every other major government publication you know
[46:08.680 --> 46:13.200]  stars and stripes Army dot mill you just everywhere saying conspiracy theorists
[46:13.200 --> 46:15.880]  want to get troops killed and they're claiming that the armies coming to
[46:15.880 --> 46:19.360]  attack Texas and Utah and take over the government and we're not going to have
[46:19.360 --> 46:24.480]  martial law this summer it's just a drill for readiness overseas but then
[46:24.480 --> 46:28.120]  North comms openly training to take over America and gun confiscate and you
[46:28.120 --> 46:31.240]  say the number one enemies veterans and gun owners and conservatives and the
[46:31.240 --> 46:35.160]  IRS is persecuting people and the arresting old ladies that run Mexican
[46:35.160 --> 46:39.400]  food restaurants for 40 years for depositing cash in the bank and there's
[46:39.400 --> 46:43.200]  government seizing power everywhere I mean look at the climate no we're not
[46:43.200 --> 46:47.720]  saying they'll be martial law this summer we're saying they're doing these
[46:47.720 --> 46:52.160]  multi-state drills which we've got local newscasts where they had some in
[46:52.160 --> 46:56.520]  four state areas five years ago where they actually ran checkpoints on the
[46:56.520 --> 47:02.040]  highways pointing guns at people I mean I've got countless videos I shot and
[47:02.040 --> 47:05.680]  other shot my four police aid films of where they'll have Marines in Alabama
[47:05.680 --> 47:09.960]  just suddenly start searching people's vehicles on the highway and confiscating
[47:09.960 --> 47:17.840]  guns it's all to condition them I mean folks the New York Times reports on
[47:17.840 --> 47:24.520]  them training Boy Scouts to take on disgruntled veterans that won't turn in
[47:24.520 --> 47:28.640]  their guns type in the headlines scouts trained to fight terrorist and more
[47:28.640 --> 47:34.480]  first paragraph their training to take on veterans and they frame the veterans
[47:34.480 --> 47:40.040]  as attacking school buses and schools so the army has to go take them out again
[47:40.040 --> 47:45.720]  the think of the narrative yes the and this was taught across the country they
[47:45.720 --> 47:49.640]  teach Girl Scouts to spy on their parents don't believe me USA Today
[47:49.640 --> 47:56.240]  reported on it like it was good they had the brownies asking mommy what she
[47:56.240 --> 48:00.680]  thought of the government and if mommy used drugs I mean give me a break that
[48:00.680 --> 48:05.080]  is beyond East Germany people the NSA spying illegally scouts trained to fight
[48:05.080 --> 48:09.760]  terrorists and more ten minutes into the arrest mayhem or the errant mayhem in
[48:09.760 --> 48:13.560]  the town near the Mexican border and the government has grown a Iraq wharf that
[48:13.560 --> 48:17.320]  has already taken out two people one slump on a desk the other covered in
[48:17.320 --> 48:21.880]  blood on the floor the responding officers eight teenage boys and girls the
[48:21.880 --> 48:26.400]  youngest 14 face trip wire and just goes in and you look at the photos in the
[48:26.400 --> 48:30.520]  photo gallery as they battle the veterans and it's always the same battle
[48:30.520 --> 48:33.760]  the veterans battle the veterans battle the veterans and then we get up here on
[48:33.760 --> 48:39.080]  air and talk about this and they're like oh none of this is going on none of
[48:39.080 --> 48:44.680]  this is happening none of this is the Delta force in fact guys see if we can
[48:44.680 --> 48:47.880]  get Thomas Sanchez I don't know if he's still alive this is like 16 years ago he
[48:47.880 --> 48:52.520]  was 60 something years old then Vietnam veteran she didn't get Thomas Sanchez the
[48:52.520 --> 48:55.560]  former emergency manager Kingsley may still be the emergency manager full I
[48:55.560 --> 48:59.560]  know she didn't get Ali Philippus former San Antonio police chief on I mean we
[48:59.560 --> 49:03.600]  can get the former director of the technical division of the NSA on in you
[49:03.600 --> 49:09.080]  know kid can we get the police chief on can we we ought to bring back those
[49:09.080 --> 49:13.840]  people that had the Delta force in their offices with $200,000 cash trying to
[49:13.840 --> 49:18.960]  compromise them and the rest of their governments took the money
[49:21.920 --> 49:26.000]  and as the police chief said last time he heard that's called bribery that's
[49:26.000 --> 49:30.960]  how the Delta force takes over foreign countries they go in for years infiltrate
[49:30.960 --> 49:35.800]  and buy off the key people they use that operation before 2003 in the invasion of
[49:35.800 --> 49:39.480]  Iraq they gave tens of billions of dollars to the entire Iraqi general
[49:39.480 --> 49:45.600]  staff to stand down that's how the Nazis took over France was a five-year
[49:45.600 --> 49:50.760]  secret payoff program of their entire general staff you understand they ran a
[49:50.760 --> 49:56.960]  Nazi takeover play a stand-down play with cities and counties all most major
[49:56.960 --> 50:01.880]  governments have been paid off by the shadow government member of the 80
[50:01.880 --> 50:04.760]  billion dollars first it was 40 then 60 then 80 billion that was phoned in on
[50:04.760 --> 50:08.760]  pallets of $100 bills that wasn't to buy off the local militias only part of it
[50:08.760 --> 50:16.640]  was in Iraq the Shiite and Sunnis it was to compromise people and then later they
[50:16.640 --> 50:21.120]  call in colonels and captains and majors and they say did you take $400,000
[50:21.120 --> 50:26.440]  $300,000 well they told me to take it well you're under investigation and then
[50:26.440 --> 50:30.560]  you get called another office they say you don't want to get indicted or get
[50:30.560 --> 50:34.920]  you know a serious problem we're gonna skip this network break and go the
[50:34.920 --> 50:39.440]  calls you're gonna need to go into see some secret operations domestically for
[50:39.440 --> 50:42.560]  us how's that sound you've already shown your proclivity to do whatever you're
[50:42.560 --> 50:47.400]  told and then if you try to go warn the public you commit suicide they kill you
[50:47.400 --> 50:51.880]  they kill you people say well aren't you dead there's metaphysical rules I've
[50:51.880 --> 50:54.680]  never been in the military I've never taken money from them I never made a
[50:54.680 --> 50:59.160]  deal with them and believe me they've come around plenty of times but I've
[50:59.160 --> 51:03.840]  also never blown sources and I've never made it personal with the people that
[51:03.840 --> 51:07.200]  are doing this they're destroying our country they're letting tyranny take
[51:07.200 --> 51:12.520]  over I intend and it's my right in the universe to speak truth and to stand
[51:12.520 --> 51:17.240]  against what they're doing and that's the reason I'm still alive is your
[51:17.240 --> 51:20.320]  prayers they know it'll underline everything I've said if they kill me
[51:20.320 --> 51:23.360]  it'll make me a martyr so they're trying to assassinate my credibility and my
[51:23.360 --> 51:27.480]  name but I've already done the mission the story's already out there people are
[51:27.480 --> 51:35.520]  already watching not just me so I could be dead today which of course I want to
[51:35.520 --> 51:40.280]  live a hundred more years but I could die today and I've already done a good
[51:40.280 --> 51:46.280]  job I can already push daisies and be honorable in the in the in the in the in
[51:46.280 --> 51:52.000]  the in the pantheon of my family lines I can measure up but I intend to do a lot
[51:52.000 --> 51:57.720]  more by the grace of God but this is real this is the big choice okay Michael in
[51:57.720 --> 52:02.400]  South Dakota than John Derek Bob and others go ahead your active duty Michael
[52:02.400 --> 52:10.600]  thanks for calling in what is your take on all this well when it broke I have a
[52:10.600 --> 52:22.680]  buddy that's in the reserves with me used to be what we call black black ops he's
[52:22.680 --> 52:27.400]  only been able to tell me a little bit here and there I kind of broke this to
[52:27.400 --> 52:34.840]  him and I'm thinking of a little bit different angle you get so come and all
[52:34.840 --> 52:41.400]  these other special forces all in one area you have missing nukes what's one
[52:41.400 --> 52:47.920]  one's best way to take out all of the United States special force well that's
[52:47.920 --> 52:50.920]  right I mean they don't from what I've read and they don't have a lot of
[52:50.920 --> 52:56.840]  missions where you have giant groups of special ops working together I mean who
[52:56.840 --> 53:01.040]  knows all I know is they say they want to win hearts and minds with these drills
[53:01.040 --> 53:05.280]  and they claim they're doing it in Texas because it's military friendly yeah
[53:05.280 --> 53:09.040]  it's military friendly that's why we're trying to keep the military from being
[53:09.040 --> 53:13.460]  in these unconstitutional missions we know that they do these homeland
[53:13.460 --> 53:18.040]  security operations to condition the public and so that's why we're putting
[53:18.040 --> 53:22.640]  heat on this so that it will be a clean operation what else did your friend have
[53:22.640 --> 53:34.200]  to say to you we both thought it was pretty scary so it is unusual I mean
[53:34.200 --> 53:40.080]  from your perspective are you saying this is unusual yeah I think it's a
[53:40.080 --> 53:45.880]  very very scary situation I don't I don't
[53:45.880 --> 53:52.960]  we both were sitting here pretty kind of kind of freaking out because yeah we got
[53:52.960 --> 54:00.040]  National Guard and sometimes reserved you know doing the like door-to-door kind
[54:00.040 --> 54:07.880]  of ready to tight drill three rolls roll through to roll through town going by
[54:07.880 --> 54:18.960]  say hey to the people do a little kind of show operations even back in 2012 we
[54:18.960 --> 54:27.360]  did a joint operation in Chicago with multinational forces and everything
[54:27.360 --> 54:31.600]  yeah let's not forget st. Louis where they had tanks rolling around and I mean
[54:31.600 --> 54:35.800]  actual tanks not just armored vehicles it's a huge conditioning operation when
[54:35.800 --> 54:39.040]  you look at it all together thank you so much for calling we're gonna go to John
[54:39.040 --> 54:42.880]  who just got out of the army we're gonna go to Derek Sergeant first-class army
[54:42.880 --> 54:46.680]  just retired last year Bob served until last year on training we'll get to all
[54:46.680 --> 54:51.840]  of you ahead of our guests but here's the issue you have Obama dissolving the
[54:51.840 --> 54:56.600]  borders you have this build-up against Russia you have all this power grabbing
[54:56.600 --> 55:01.280]  everything's moving in high gear they could pull off a false flag announced
[55:01.280 --> 55:05.040]  gun confiscation and they know the Legislature of Texas and the governor
[55:05.040 --> 55:07.880]  and they know the Legislature of Utah is not gonna follow those orders and
[55:07.880 --> 55:13.640]  that's why they're listed as hostile as a sigh up on the military to begin to
[55:13.640 --> 55:18.120]  test the waters and see what we'll do this is a bigger sigh up on the military
[55:18.120 --> 55:21.720]  than anybody else I predicted they'd sigh up and claim we're attacking the
[55:21.720 --> 55:25.600]  military that's not what we're doing every day trying to end the death panels
[55:25.600 --> 55:29.240]  for the military that do not treat list everybody knows the truth this is
[55:29.240 --> 55:32.680]  preparations for martial law I don't know when the hammer gets dropped but
[55:32.680 --> 55:38.520]  what's going on let's talk to Derek in North Carolina just retired what's your
[55:38.520 --> 55:44.800]  view on all this Derek Alex you are on point my friend you are explosive let
[55:44.800 --> 55:49.440]  me tell you something my friend in North Carolina at Fort Bragg prior to
[55:49.440 --> 55:53.800]  Hosni Mubarak being pushed out by Hillary and her sinister pals the
[55:53.800 --> 55:58.920]  Egyptian military was secretly training with the integrated community of
[55:58.920 --> 56:03.400]  clandestine services of the Central Intelligence Agency and the special
[56:03.400 --> 56:07.800]  operations in JSOC here at Fort Bragg and this was right around the time frame
[56:07.800 --> 56:12.240]  that you were predicting this was going to come true I've been training on this
[56:12.240 --> 56:17.560]  installation for 24 years I've recently retired and I've been on many missions
[56:17.560 --> 56:22.720]  along with the different units they were called other coalition forces in Iraq
[56:22.720 --> 56:27.720]  because we will classify we were not allowed to be identified as American
[56:27.720 --> 56:36.160]  soldiers and this is in Iraq however now we have Russian soldiers on Fort Bragg
[56:36.160 --> 56:42.360]  Russian soldiers again this this is a repeat of what you saw during the
[56:42.360 --> 56:47.120]  Egyptian campaign and what what happened what's happening is anytime the United
[56:47.120 --> 56:51.880]  States wants to over for a dictator or a puppet they integrate the clandestine
[56:51.880 --> 56:55.960]  services of the Central Intelligence Agency and the Joint Special Operations
[56:55.960 --> 57:01.000]  Command and there is a certain narrative that's put to it and that goes on to your
[57:01.000 --> 57:04.880]  premise that it's being it's a condition that the American people are going to
[57:04.880 --> 57:08.800]  accept it because it's just routine training well I know that I would hear
[57:08.800 --> 57:13.800]  four or five years ago that they had Russians doing anti-terror training in
[57:13.800 --> 57:18.000]  in in Colorado and I wouldn't believe it then it came out in the news so they're
[57:18.000 --> 57:22.320]  starting a war with Russia but at the same time they've got Russian troops at
[57:22.320 --> 57:27.760]  the bases well what do you think is going on what's happening is is you saw in
[57:27.760 --> 57:32.960]  the Boston bombing it was a dry run you saw the Boston Police Department not
[57:32.960 --> 57:39.160]  even informed as to the to the genesis of this explosion which was the Zarnaya
[57:39.160 --> 57:44.200]  brothers who not only the New York Police Department the federal authorities and
[57:44.200 --> 57:48.800]  also international authorities i.e. Interpol knew of these gentlemen's
[57:48.800 --> 57:53.320]  existence sure and they would just they were just waiting for these guys to go
[57:53.320 --> 57:57.760]  ahead and launch their campaign and they were coats they are puppets and what
[57:57.760 --> 58:02.960]  happened was they wanted to see the public's reaction in Watertown, Massachusetts
[58:02.960 --> 58:08.840]  where my brother had lived 1,724 will privately owned homes doors were
[58:08.840 --> 58:13.840]  kicked in and in these homes they were not looking for Mr. Zarnaya they were
[58:13.840 --> 58:19.720]  asking for gun and registration numbers and if you go back a few years further on
[58:19.720 --> 58:24.120]  MSNBC hold on this is sensational I'm gonna have to hold you over clearly
[58:24.120 --> 58:27.600]  because I mean depending on admits these are testing the public in the military
[58:27.600 --> 58:31.540]  but you're saying specifically being in Fort Bragg you know that that's what
[58:31.540 --> 58:34.800]  happened I mean I need to confirm that with you we're back in 70 seconds then
[58:34.800 --> 58:44.800]  we'll go to John, Tom, Bob, we're gonna go to everybody stay with us. Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:27.960]  all right I want to move quick I can spend an hour with each one of these
[01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:34.160]  guys calling in it's just such a compendium of documentation that there
[01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:37.680]  are forces in the government that want gun confiscation that want total
[01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:41.200]  dictatorial control it's now happening they're doing some of the biggest
[01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:47.160]  exercises ever and it lists Texas is hostile in other areas they're clearly
[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:51.160]  getting ready for false flags I don't know what's going to happen this summer
[01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:55.480]  all I know is we have to investigate all of this and we have to get a debate
[01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:59.440]  going about the fact that we're pretty much a dictatorship now even mainline
[01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:04.280]  constitutional scholars on both sides say that so anything could happen in this
[01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:10.040]  climate of power grabbing Derek a data dump of the info other points that
[01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:13.280]  people should know because you just got out of the military working there at
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:19.680]  Fort Bragg what's the big picture where do you think all this is going one of
[01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:22.880]  the big pitches is alexis which you've been hitting on for a long time the
[01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:27.560]  veterans in the care that they're given is going to continue to diminish that's
[01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:31.680]  the first thing the second thing we need to be aware of is that it's a foregone
[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:35.920]  close conclusion that Hillary Clinton is being groomed right now by the
[01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:40.720]  globalist to be installed we already saw a massive attack on Ted Cruz once he
[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:44.880]  just made an announcement announcement only we already see we already see what
[01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:49.120]  the waters are going on there the big thing that we need to emphasize is
[01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:52.680]  mission creep everything that you're talking about if you notice it if you
[01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:57.520]  chronologically categorize it it's going in small increments sure they say
[01:01:57.520 --> 01:02:01.880]  the Patriot Act is for terrorists now it's for veterans they say that the
[01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:04.920]  military is just going to help with some security next they're knocking on your
[01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:10.400]  doors asking about your guns at Katrina and taking them it's a power grab in
[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:14.640]  that the last thing I'd like to say Alex is the one thing that you have to make
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:18.360]  the public aware of is it's going to be like the National Defense Authorization
[01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:23.480]  Act how it was signed and slipped under the carpet at midnight on New Year's Eve
[01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:29.040]  while everybody was sleeping and I can say all I have to say is God bless you
[01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:34.120]  God bless Joe Biggs you guys have a very very massive campaign in front of you
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:39.080]  because as an as an airport information warrior my job is to test it and see
[01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:43.440]  where the atmospherics are on the streets I've been to a lot of rallies and a
[01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:48.520]  lot of gatherings and people are just not wanting to wake up people are in that
[01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:53.040]  decadent trance people are in that Stockholm syndrome they're in denial we
[01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:57.680]  have to get that message out it is an information war we need more people out
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:01.560]  there God bless you Derek thank you yeah we have such prosperity because of
[01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:08.000]  freedom that we're just dead in the water but it only took three percent to
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:11.960]  defeat King George and that's what the globalists have to understand they do
[01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:15.480]  understand and this is what I was told by our retired military officer about
[01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:19.760]  five years ago I never talked about it even though it answered everything I
[01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:23.160]  was saying why are they targeting veterans I mean veterans haven't done
[01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:26.480]  any terror attacks not doing anything wrong why are they teaching police that
[01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:30.520]  veterans will attack you will kill you I mean it's in mainstream news you know
[01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:33.040]  that veterans are the number one terror threat and they believe they're gonna
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:37.000]  ID every department and he said to me because they're going to take all of
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:40.200]  their benefits they've already started to do that and they're not gonna give them
[01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:43.600]  health care and they're a bunch of veterans that that that are gonna feel
[01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:47.840]  screwed over and are going to start taking it out and if they don't they'll
[01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:54.200]  stage something to make the veterans the enemy so it's like when they attack the
[01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:57.760]  bonus marchers from World War one who just wanted their promised bonuses and
[01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:01.040]  they attacked a bunch of them so the only enemy basically the globalists have
[01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:06.480]  left they think is the veterans we're gonna go to break we got Sheriff Richard
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:09.640]  Mack coming on but I'm gonna push him back five six seven minutes I've got to
[01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:13.000]  go to John and Marilyn just got out of the Army Tom Vietnam vet on the take
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:20.640]  over target areas and Bob who just got out this year on the training we're not

[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:26.520]  current to give us your take and I you know I wish people called in disagree
[01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:31.960]  with me but but I know I'm right I mean it's all over the news that they're
[01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:35.040]  training the military to take only American people why do you think the
[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:40.160]  military is one of the most await groups and then the Psyop you know what with the
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:43.560]  media making fun of us they go I thought the military is a wake Alex why are
[01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:47.360]  they coming to get us now know when the public doesn't understand the whole
[01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:51.680]  military culture they're following orders we're trying to stop them getting

[01:08:54.360 --> 01:09:00.640]  training to take on disgruntled vets I can show you Janet Napolitano two years
[01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:07.280]  ago in the Washington Post being pulled up saying she stands by the domestic
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:13.560]  groups the number one threat and in that group veterans are number one bull bull
[01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:17.280]  and they've got secret death list I mean Joe Biggs went into the VA here in
[01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:24.600]  Austin no exaggeration more than ten times shrapnel bullet holes coughing up blood and they
[01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:27.120]  wouldn't even give him treat they kept sending him back sending him back he's
[01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:31.800]  on a no treat list people with terminal stuff that can be corrected there it is
[01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:37.280]  Napolitano defense Homeland Security report on right wing extremism 2009
[01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:42.080]  saying veterans the number one threat and that was the document we were leaked
[01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:47.520]  by a federal marshal okay so this is going on we're gonna be talking to him
[01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:51.880]  about five six minutes I want to go to John Tom and Bob John just got out of
[01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:56.680]  the Army what's your take on the expansion of Jade Helm to other states
[01:09:56.680 --> 01:10:03.560]  now Mississippi and Florida well I'll resume the 82nd airborne for five years
[01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:06.880]  and then I got out and I transferred to the Maryland National Guard I ended up
[01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:10.280]  in the scouts because they took a look at my record and when I ended up in the
[01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:13.320]  scouts they immediately tried to recruit me to the snipers now they weren't
[01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:16.840]  sending me to sniper school they just wanted to you know train me up and get
[01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:20.760]  to know me before they spent any money on me right so I asked them what they do
[01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:26.320]  and he said oh it's great man you know blah blah blah we went down to the slums
[01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:31.760]  in Washington DC last weekend and we were with a bunch of other sniper units
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:37.480]  from various federal agencies like the FBI, DEA, ATF and we all got dressed up in
[01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:43.760]  EPA jumpsuits and broke down their silence sniper rifles and put them in
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:49.320]  EPA toolboxes and they infiltrate they practice infiltrating into projects and
[01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:54.240]  posting up in buildings and I was like that's illegal you're not allowed to do
[01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:57.400]  that and he just laughs at me and he's like oh I don't have to follow the rules
[01:10:57.400 --> 01:11:01.800]  like we're the scout snipers this is a regular Maryland National Guard unit
[01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:05.360]  telling me they don't have to follow the rules and I was like you know thanks man
[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:09.960]  I'll just stick with my guys in the scouts I'm good but uh but you know
[01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:14.800]  immediately I was like ostracized I was like not the guy to well see that's the
[01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:17.840]  plan let me tell you what would have happened if you went along with that
[01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:23.640]  then they'd say now we're gonna go raid some drug dealers and then next it would
[01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:27.720]  be gun shops and I mean I make films on this interviewing the Marines Army
[01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:32.120]  officers I mean one of them was a I'm not even allowed to say the point is this
[01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:36.400]  has been going on for 20 years but it's been exponentially going up next you'll
[01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:40.080]  go to your real mission and that'll be going to churches and listening to people
[01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:45.520]  hearing what's being said filling out files then it'll be laundering money
[01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:50.400]  then it'll be drug dealing then it will be killing people and the only reason I
[01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:54.960]  can tell you this is I've talked to so many people who are involved in it and
[01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:58.120]  I've had family involved in it okay I'm just gonna leave it at that and I don't
[01:11:58.120 --> 01:12:04.240]  mean just one person in my family this is a huge submerged iceberg of evil that
[01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:08.260]  is going on out there and boy as soon as you wouldn't be part of that you got
[01:12:08.260 --> 01:12:13.480]  put on a list to be given the deadly vaccines to be to be to be denied care
[01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:17.320]  once you need it in the VA because you're an American Patriot you've now
[01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:21.040]  been listed for a purge when they take over so that's why they know there's
[01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:24.040]  gonna be a war with vets because they're going to come after you brother and
[01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:28.400]  I'm this is not alarmist but I'm just telling you what happened and I'm so
[01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:32.520]  sad this has happened but now we're all in the info war anything else you can
[01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:40.360]  add sir yes when I was in the regular army I had plenty of guys that I mean
[01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:44.800]  plenty of them are they just used to constantly say all the time I don't care
[01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:49.240]  for there to steal the oil blah blah blah you know I just want to kill people
[01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:54.000]  but they're not they're not patriots they're just brainwashed kids that have
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:57.800]  been sitting around playing video games and once they do it a couple years in
[01:12:57.800 --> 01:13:03.840]  the military then they then they go to be you know Johnny special forces and it's
[01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:08.360]  I guarantee you they haven't changed their mentality they just want to list
[01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:13.920]  weights and take vitamin S and sit around and drink protein shakes and be
[01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:17.840]  tough guys they don't read any books they don't understand what's going on and
[01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:21.960]  they refuse to look at the big picture they absolutely refuse to look at the
[01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:26.200]  big picture I was in the third brigade in the 82nd airborne they're in Iraq
[01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:32.320]  right now we exclusively hold security for special operations forces I'm not
[01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:36.200]  going to get into what we used to do but it was really disturbing and it made me
[01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:39.960]  sick to my stomach and I used to cry myself to sleep I know it is used to
[01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:44.720]  torture people realize everything that all the liberals had been talking about
[01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:51.240]  when George Bush was in power was absolutely correct but you know but
[01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:54.720]  they were only exposing it so they could get in power now it's worse under
[01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:59.160]  them absolutely that's what they do like it like a couple of middle school
[01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:02.840]  girls they sit around and they make fun of each other even though they're all
[01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:07.640]  engaged in the same BS well here's the deal brother they're coming after
[01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:11.840]  everybody now and all these guys that think they're part of secret operations
[01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:16.080]  and it's fun to be a spy in America it's called being a traitor and you are
[01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:21.320]  going to be hung out to dry like nine of the long knives in 1933 once this new
[01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:27.040]  world order comes into play it's guaranteed and it is so over the top
[01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:32.880]  John God bless you I really appreciate your call we've got Bob in Alabama Navy

[01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:31.760]  because of you supporting him and spreading the word and Sheriff Mack
[01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:35.680]  you've heard some of these soldiers calling in with these chilling stories
[01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:39.600]  of the incremental preparation for military takeover in America that's
[01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:44.560]  what this giant drill is we have it from the inside not just their own
[01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:49.000]  documents this Jade Helm it'll have some other ops that are for overseas that
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:52.120]  the media will be shown you've been speaking out against this forever with
[01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:59.360]  the late great Jack Mclam and others what overall can we do because we see
[01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:04.040]  Obama power grabbing we see more power grabbing we saw the previous ten years
[01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:09.880]  what do you think's really going on Sheriff Richard Mack well Alex so first
[01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:15.280]  I want to thank you for having me back on and I want to tell everybody I did
[01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:19.880]  have some serious health problems a major heart attack just ten weeks ago I
[01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:23.840]  want to thank the good Lord for the second chance and and more than ever
[01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:29.920]  with heartfelt sincerity I'm really grateful to be here absolutely I didn't
[01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:32.880]  want to get into your private stuff but since you raised it thank you for
[01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:36.320]  coming on and just thank God that you're alive was really need you but maybe
[01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:40.920]  you should need to stop working 18 hours a day at this point my wife keeps
[01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:46.200]  saying the same thing Alex so thank you for backing her up on that but no we
[01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:50.800]  we are in a perilous times the Constitution's hanging by a thread
[01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:55.560]  America is being destroyed from within we're paying for our own destruction the
[01:17:55.560 --> 01:18:00.720]  military is being used against us no question about it and the militarization
[01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:05.200]  of our law enforcement throughout America is also very concerning but there is a
[01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:10.400]  solution and that's what we do at CSPO a and I definitely wanted that all your
[01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:14.880]  listeners know that there is something we can do in a peaceful manner to restore
[01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:19.640]  freedom to America and we have the evidence as you alluded to Alex we have
[01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:23.920]  hundreds of sheriffs already on board with what we're doing many of them have
[01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:28.840]  taken courageous stands like Sheriff Finch in Florida and you mentioned
[01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:33.960]  probably the consummate sheriff in America right now David A. Clark Jr. from
[01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:41.040]  Milwaukee and he in 2013 appeared at our CSPO a convention he was named the
[01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:45.400]  constitutional sheriff of the year and there's others even a chief of police in
[01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:52.720]  Detroit is encouraging gun ownership by his constituents the head of Interpol
[01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:56.760]  said armed citizens worldwide against mass shooters what's going on that's
[01:18:56.760 --> 01:19:03.200]  Interpol yeah it is that's unheard of and and a lot of this is unprecedented no
[01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:06.320]  question about it and that's because they're good police and sheriffs who
[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:09.320]  want freedom and that's why we shouldn't just have a mindless fight with the
[01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:13.560]  police we the citizens have to give them support to be constitutional and fight
[01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:17.560]  the globalist takeover right that's exactly correct and it's not going to
[01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:22.800]  happen without citizens getting involved and so the invitation to everyone
[01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:27.880]  listening to your program is get involved go to CSPO a dot org it's on your
[01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:33.080]  screen and it'll be on info wars but look there is something we can do there
[01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:40.320]  is a solution and I hate to say this because it sounds like Obama ish there
[01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:45.440]  is hope that we can take America back and I can show you evidence after evidence
[01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:48.960]  I know let's talk about that evidence but also talk about the power grab give
[01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:54.120]  folks the acronym of what CSPO a stands for constitutional sheriffs and peace
[01:19:54.120 --> 01:19:57.440]  officers association and everybody should be part of that and support it

[01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:28.120]  on very successful initiative he launched I don't know four or five years ago
[01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:31.800]  and it's become really a thorn on the side of the establishment
[01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:36.680]  Sheriff Richard Mack I want to go to Frank Bob and Tom in this short segment
[01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:39.880]  in the next segment we're going to talk about the tyranny the real threats and
[01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:43.880]  ways to counter it the IRS these announcements that they say call the
[01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:46.520]  police on someone if they withdraw their own money from the bank
[01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:50.760]  that was mainstream news yesterday I mean the tyranny is accelerating we're
[01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:54.680]  going to talk about that with Sheriff Richard Mack
[01:24:54.680 --> 01:24:59.960]  I want to go to Bob here in just a moment but briefly
[01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:03.720]  why is the tyranny moving so quick in your view is it because
[01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:07.240]  the globalists know people are waking up or because there's not enough
[01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:10.840]  opposition and they want to go ahead and just cinch things up
[01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:15.480]  I think it's not enough opposition yet I think they have become so complacent in
[01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:18.600]  their tyrannical efforts they don't care what we know we don't
[01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:22.600]  they don't care what we do they know that they can get away with anything
[01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:26.280]  certainly the national media has been allowing them to get away with anything
[01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:32.440]  and there's no obstructions from congress the republicans that just got
[01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:36.360]  reelected and landslides in November have
[01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:38.760]  done nothing about it they haven't kept their word
[01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:41.960]  wouldn't even ban partial birth abortion they had all the votes wouldn't do
[01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:45.960]  any of it no they won't stop anything and they voted
[01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:51.880]  to fund all of obama's programs and it's just absurd that
[01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:55.000]  washington dc on both sides of the aisle is so corrupt
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:58.440]  that's it we're in deep trouble folks we're not being alarmist here
[01:25:58.440 --> 01:26:01.560]  hopefully by ringing the alarm we can get something going here
[01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:04.520]  bob in alabama just got out of the military wants to talk about
[01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:09.880]  this jade helm now expanded to two other states so what's your take on it sir
[01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:13.080]  hey alex thanks for taking my call longtime listener
[01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:17.240]  first time caller thank you combat veteran from coast of afghanistan or rock
[01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:20.680]  to a lesser extent libya i didn't actually get shot at libya one of the
[01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:23.000]  few places but i do a lot of running around
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:27.000]  in north africa northeast asian south china seas
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:30.120]  couple of things i like to talk about uh the sheriff had mentioned militarization
[01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:34.040]  of the police absolutely you know i mean how many police forces
[01:26:34.040 --> 01:26:37.080]  need an m-rap don't doesn't make any sense to me
[01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:39.960]  but one of the things that you touched on i think it was a couple days ago you
[01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:42.600]  talked about it and i think it bears repeating
[01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:48.120]  it's a normalization okay so what is the new normal well when you have guys that
[01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:51.720]  are soldiers that are walking around and they're in 10 different states
[01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:54.760]  and they're they're conducting uh whatever it is they're doing they're
[01:26:54.760 --> 01:26:57.960]  supposedly doing training what they're doing is they're doing normalization so
[01:26:57.960 --> 01:27:01.320]  that becomes the new normal so when you've got soldiers
[01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:05.320]  and marines and all the rest of these folks walking around uh day to day in
[01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:08.360]  your community you're like oh that's normal that's probably fine
[01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:13.720]  and it's slow rolling it's it's a it's a insidious creep of tyranny
[01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:16.600]  because there's no good reason for them to actually be doing what they're doing
[01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:19.240]  because excuse me well then you hear the other
[01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:21.640]  callers i mean i mean i have news articles
[01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:25.160]  over the years showing it but you hear the callers where they've got military
[01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:28.920]  in plain clothes running operations with the police all over the place
[01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:32.280]  it's totally illegal and they're just doing it
[01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:36.840]  yeah well that's because we lost posicumitatus uh in addition with the
[01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:40.440]  national defense authorization act of 2006 which usurped the ability of the
[01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:43.320]  governors to actually use their own national guard forces that's right as
[01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:47.080]  an example uh but posicumitatus is a perfect example we
[01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:50.440]  did not want to conduct militarization with the military
[01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:54.280]  on our domestic soil to deal with law enforcement
[01:27:54.280 --> 01:27:59.240]  tactics i mean it's just it's it's beyond what the founding fathers
[01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:01.800]  every thought could ever go i mean the founding fathers of the newer we're
[01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:04.200]  going on right now they're probably rolling in the graves
[01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:07.720]  because this is completely and totally unacceptable you know this is going to
[01:28:07.720 --> 01:28:10.280]  become the new normal now that we're going to go ahead and insert the
[01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:13.000]  united states military to go ahead and potentially fight
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:16.120]  the american people or work in existing the police sure
[01:28:16.120 --> 01:28:19.400]  well i mean back when they were getting rid of posicumitatus 20 years ago
[01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:22.040]  incrementally they said oh your conspiracy theorist is not happening
[01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:25.160]  now they just admit it's happening they have wellness checks that are really
[01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:28.440]  gun confiscations we saw what happened in katrina thank you bob
[01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:31.640]  we'll go to tom and frank at the start of the next segment and then get into all
[01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:35.400]  the stuff with uh our guest who joins us share of richard mac
[01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:39.400]  but why do you think they're accelerating the conditioning of the military on the
[01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:44.680]  streets a sheriff you know that uh the speculation
[01:28:44.680 --> 01:28:47.880]  there uh makes the mind run wild because
[01:28:47.880 --> 01:28:52.680]  nothing can be good about that uh and the the last caller was absolutely
[01:28:52.680 --> 01:28:56.280]  correct i mean uh this administration and others
[01:28:56.280 --> 01:29:00.040]  bush administration also have completely gutted and destroyed the
[01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:04.040]  the posicumitatus act uh they violate the law routinely
[01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:08.040]  and and then try to make us think it's all normal just like he said
[01:29:08.040 --> 01:29:11.960]  but why they would be doing this uh here uh i'm sure that they're going to
[01:29:11.960 --> 01:29:16.840]  pretend that they need to do this to prevent uh attacks from uh
[01:29:16.840 --> 01:29:21.000]  international terrorists or domestic terrorists but the biggest problem with
[01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:24.920]  that is obamas in uh secret meetings with iran to
[01:29:24.920 --> 01:29:28.920]  make sure that they get nuclear weaponry and then he makes sure that the door is
[01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:32.120]  open for them to come into our country through the southern border
[01:29:32.120 --> 01:29:36.120]  sure exactly we need what's constitutional is to have the joint
[01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:39.880]  forces on the border not not not worrying about taking out
[01:29:39.880 --> 01:29:43.240]  uh sheriff richard mac and alex jones and ron paul and we're in their memos we're
[01:29:43.240 --> 01:29:46.840]  in their manuals we've shot i mean we we are listed folks i mean i mean they

[01:34:00.600 --> 01:34:03.880]  with facebook saying that they're going to start restricting alternative
[01:34:03.880 --> 01:34:07.800]  media news libertarian news um the pentagons talked about trying to
[01:34:07.800 --> 01:34:12.520]  restrict the drudge report because the military loves the drudge report

[01:34:25.320 --> 01:34:29.400]  as upset i am at the system recruiting thug cops
[01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:32.600]  the average cop out there is more awake than the public and we need to reach out
[01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:35.960]  to him not playing to soros is planned to hate the police
[01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:39.000]  and then complete their journey into hating the public as well
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:42.760]  and i've got like five articles of cops being killed yesterday but nobody wants
[01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:45.000]  to talk about that when they were trying to protect people
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:48.200]  california police officer shot dead responding to suicide call
[01:34:48.200 --> 01:34:51.640]  wisconsin officer bank robbery suspect killed in shootout
[01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:55.000]  we need to understand that just because we've let the police
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:58.200]  be turned into globalist operatives in many cases
[01:34:58.200 --> 01:35:01.880]  that just having a war with them as part of the larger globalist plan
[01:35:01.880 --> 01:35:05.480]  we need to short circuit that big time we'll get sheriffs max take on that
[01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:10.040]  finish two callers that are military on this conus takeover drill
[01:35:10.040 --> 01:35:14.280]  and then we'll let him have the floor a little bit into the next hour as well
[01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:17.800]  but but major developments unfolding we have the new

[01:36:17.240 --> 01:36:21.480]  i wanted to talk to sheriff richard mac before he expands on it
[01:36:21.480 --> 01:36:25.240]  some about csp oa your constitutional sheriffs
[01:36:25.240 --> 01:36:29.720]  a police officer association and the the hundreds of sheriffs that you've had
[01:36:29.720 --> 01:36:33.160]  to your events and what's happening and and what the
[01:36:33.160 --> 01:36:36.920]  constitutional role of the sheriff is and why this is such a big part of the
[01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:40.200]  solution then we'll get into the opposite of the solution
[01:36:40.200 --> 01:36:43.960]  what you see is the biggest threats and biggest problems and again sheriff
[01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:49.480]  richard mac well thanks elixin i i absolutely got to get
[01:36:49.480 --> 01:36:54.200]  that vitamin d stuff from you i'm still looking for all sorts of
[01:36:54.200 --> 01:36:59.640]  things to restore my heart so i put my heart in
[01:36:59.640 --> 01:37:03.640]  soul into this and my heart just isn't hanging in there very well so
[01:37:03.640 --> 01:37:07.480]  real price for him sounds like a great product and i want also everybody to
[01:37:07.480 --> 01:37:11.000]  pray for uh joce briley and to have a miracle with her
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:15.160]  health situation uh very dear friend of both of ours
[01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:18.760]  alex i i told you at the very beginning we have proof
[01:37:18.760 --> 01:37:23.000]  that this is already working we have proof that we are right
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:27.960]  and i almost also want to remind everybody this is a peaceful but very
[01:37:27.960 --> 01:37:32.040]  effective process and we have people like sheriff clark and share
[01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:37.720]  finch and share palmer and share rogers and many others across the country
[01:37:37.720 --> 01:37:42.200]  we've had over 400 attend our con our conventions where we train them
[01:37:42.200 --> 01:37:45.960]  how to do this and how to stand against the federal government
[01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:51.560]  we're now starting a significant training in standing against the irs and
[01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:58.920]  way back in 1994 we had uh dick carver uh on the front cover
[01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:04.440]  of time magazine that is dick carver right there he was a county commissioner
[01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:11.240]  from nigh county nebada this is the this is the october 23rd 1995 issue of time
[01:38:11.240 --> 01:38:15.160]  magazine he got up on a bulldozer and reopened the
[01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:18.360]  road that the forest service said he could not touch
[01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:21.960]  he got on his bulldozer and opened it anyway because the county commissioners
[01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:27.000]  voted unanimously to open it against the wishes
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:32.040]  and orders of the forest service then in 2003
[01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:37.240]  in my new book uh are you a david and and this has got to get to everybody
[01:38:37.240 --> 01:38:41.480]  are you a david it's available at the website there's evidence in here that
[01:38:41.480 --> 01:38:44.840]  we talk about how many sheriffs are standing and fighting
[01:38:44.840 --> 01:38:51.560]  and in 2003 this documents an article in range magazine where three sheriffs
[01:38:51.560 --> 01:38:57.320]  sheriff penrod from california from san Bernadino california
[01:38:57.320 --> 01:39:01.720]  sheriff gary amen from uh owee county uh idoho
[01:39:01.720 --> 01:39:06.040]  and sheriff ken jones from uh urica county
[01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:09.960]  nevada those three sheriffs kicked the blm's butt
[01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:14.440]  told them to get lost in the same situation that happened to bundy's
[01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:18.520]  this these three sheriffs prevented a bundy situation
[01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:22.520]  told the blm that they were booked their law enforcement authority in their
[01:39:22.520 --> 01:39:25.960]  counties and told all of them all federal agents
[01:39:25.960 --> 01:39:29.000]  you must check with me before you do anything
[01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:33.960]  in my county this is exactly what we're doing at cspoa
[01:39:33.960 --> 01:39:37.400]  everyone who joins us is supporting that movement
[01:39:37.400 --> 01:39:41.000]  and that uh educational process with all the sheriffs
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:45.880]  imagine that we had hundreds of sheriffs just like sheriff clark and sheriff
[01:39:45.880 --> 01:39:49.320]  brad rogers who kicked the fda out of his county
[01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:53.800]  for harassing an anglish farmer these are the sheriffs that are making
[01:39:53.800 --> 01:40:00.360]  um what we're doing exemplary and also it makes it real
[01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:05.720]  this is the real deal as you said alex we have a real viable solution and we
[01:40:05.720 --> 01:40:08.920]  want to get into this further but i do want to uh kind of
[01:40:08.920 --> 01:40:12.840]  hit this one hard who's going to stop the crimes of the irs
[01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:16.840]  in your county the sheriff must know and understand
[01:40:16.840 --> 01:40:21.800]  his job in defending you against tyrants and government agents who are
[01:40:21.800 --> 01:40:24.840]  nothing but crooks and criminals and have been
[01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:31.000]  for years and years and years so continue break it down
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:34.760]  well this this is the thing we you alluded to this earlier
[01:40:34.760 --> 01:40:38.360]  they are now confiscating bank accounts at a
[01:40:38.360 --> 01:40:42.680]  tremendous rate since we had this farce dog and pony show about the crimes of
[01:40:42.680 --> 01:40:46.280]  the irs against constitutional groups and tea party groups
[01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:50.360]  the irs has grabbed and stolen more power
[01:40:50.360 --> 01:40:54.040]  not less more power and a friend of mine just called
[01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:59.560]  and told me about his situation because he runs a gun show in the midwest
[01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:03.080]  and the irs seized all his bank accounts
[01:41:03.080 --> 01:41:06.760]  because and stole 93 thousand dollars from him
[01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:12.600]  because he deposits cash in his bank accounts that he's done for 25 years
[01:41:12.600 --> 01:41:15.000]  uh you probably know him but i'm not going to say his name i don't want to
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:18.440]  sure but where are you supposed to deposit cash
[01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:23.880]  i know and they know that he runs shows where people pay admission at the door
[01:41:23.880 --> 01:41:27.560]  and they pay in cash they knew he had committed no crime
[01:41:27.560 --> 01:41:31.240]  they knew he wasn't running prostitution or gun uh
[01:41:31.240 --> 01:41:37.560]  gun illegal guns or um drugs they knew he was not well obama has said he'll
[01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:40.920]  use the bureaucracy to go after the second amendment
[01:41:40.920 --> 01:41:44.120]  and they're doing it i mean that a lot of big banks won't even let you have a
[01:41:44.120 --> 01:41:47.960]  bank account now if you're in the gun business and why isn't
[01:41:47.960 --> 01:41:51.960]  why isn't the local sheriff stopping this sort of thing
[01:41:51.960 --> 01:41:55.400]  well we actually have now a sheriff in new mexico
[01:41:55.400 --> 01:41:59.640]  who told the irs to pound sand and now we're going to really focus
[01:41:59.640 --> 01:42:04.760]  on this uh very issue of irs criminality i want to break some of these
[01:42:04.760 --> 01:42:07.800]  sheriffs down if you can stay a little bit with us in the next hour as well
[01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:11.240]  and talk about the role of the sheriff in the constitution and again you know
[01:42:11.240 --> 01:42:13.560]  what you're talking about you've won at the supreme court you're not just
[01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:17.640]  blowing smoke here and how upside down it is now
[01:42:17.640 --> 01:42:21.080]  that the feds are telling local police what to do
[01:42:21.080 --> 01:42:24.600]  local sheriffs what to do and now saying oh here work with the army
[01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:27.880]  this is the takeover i want to go to tom and frank they've been holding for about
[01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:31.480]  an hour tom in bristlevania is a veteran wants to talk
[01:42:31.480 --> 01:42:35.080]  about the expansion of jade helm and give us his take on it
[01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:41.000]  so thanks tom go ahead yes alex welcome the first thing i want to say is we got
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:44.760]  great soldiers but they got to stay focused
[01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:48.760]  now and and now when we had areas we couldn't take over
[01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:51.720]  they set up a free fire zone so when they got
[01:42:51.720 --> 01:42:56.200]  going to these states there'll be areas that'll be safe areas like the friendly
[01:42:56.200 --> 01:42:58.840]  village and everybody out there that wants to be
[01:42:58.840 --> 01:43:01.960]  free they're going to be targets and when i came back
[01:43:01.960 --> 01:43:06.280]  from norm in 1969 i was at fordwood texas
[01:43:06.280 --> 01:43:09.960]  and all we did was train for riot control
[01:43:09.960 --> 01:43:13.880]  you know the formation with fixed bayonets and live ammo
[01:43:13.880 --> 01:43:17.560]  and if they gave us an order to shoot we would have so
[01:43:17.560 --> 01:43:21.640]  that's kind of the aftermath of what could happen if they do a takeover
[01:43:21.640 --> 01:43:25.560]  so we all got to stay focused and just be on a defense
[01:43:25.560 --> 01:43:30.040]  thank you god bless you sir anything else
[01:43:30.040 --> 01:43:34.280]  uh well in colleen texas
[01:43:34.280 --> 01:43:40.280]  jane fondy was there when we were down there and the captain said if you go to
[01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:42.840]  that protest i don't care if you are a sergeant
[01:43:42.840 --> 01:43:47.240]  you're going to have kt until you're out of the army
[01:43:47.240 --> 01:43:50.440]  so they were trying to keep you from going and protesting hanoi jane just
[01:43:50.440 --> 01:43:53.560]  just classic what do you make of just these massive
[01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:56.520]  drills and the power grabbing that obama is doing right now
[01:43:56.520 --> 01:43:59.400]  that's why people are so concerned about this because we know
[01:43:59.400 --> 01:44:02.760]  they're training the military to take on the tea party
[01:44:02.760 --> 01:44:06.680]  well i think veterans are a little scared because they know what can happen
[01:44:06.680 --> 01:44:10.360]  you know when you start firing your weapon you know everything's you know
[01:44:10.360 --> 01:44:14.200]  the game's over so if you can wake people up
[01:44:14.200 --> 01:44:18.120]  young kids are on the internet they know what's going on a friend of mine stopped
[01:44:18.120 --> 01:44:22.120]  by he's 27 and i just mentioned half of
[01:44:22.120 --> 01:44:25.960]  that sentence about what's going on and he said he knows he knows
[01:44:25.960 --> 01:44:30.920]  so they're preparing so that's the best we can do absolutely well
[01:44:30.920 --> 01:44:34.760]  go ahead good well god bless you sir i appreciate
[01:44:34.760 --> 01:44:37.320]  your call thank you for holding to say that let's go to frank
[01:44:37.320 --> 01:44:40.360]  in north carolina and then i want to ask sheriff
[01:44:40.360 --> 01:44:43.480]  richard mac what is his line in the sand because
[01:44:43.480 --> 01:44:47.720]  i'm not looking for trouble i have fought in the information war for 23 years
[01:44:47.720 --> 01:44:52.200]  20 years on air we've had a big effect and i know if other people get involved
[01:44:52.200 --> 01:44:58.120]  and promote what the sheriff's doing and others are doing we can defeat this but
[01:44:58.120 --> 01:45:01.880]  stuff is moving so fast i mean i'm not going to a fema camp nobody's forcibly
[01:45:01.880 --> 01:45:04.280]  inoculating me and people said oh that'll never happen
[01:45:04.280 --> 01:45:07.880]  well now now hillary's talking about fun camps they're talking about force
[01:45:07.880 --> 01:45:11.640]  inoculation what is your line in the sand we're going to talk
[01:45:11.640 --> 01:45:14.360]  about that uh with the sheriff here in a moment but final
[01:45:14.360 --> 01:45:17.400]  caller for this hour frank in north carolina thanks for holding
[01:45:17.400 --> 01:45:23.000]  you're on the air welcome ex marine go ahead yeah alex i just wanted to make a
[01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.560]  point i i don't know i think it comes across as a
[01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:30.920]  little disingenuous when we act surprised that uh they see veterans
[01:45:30.920 --> 01:45:34.280]  returning veterans veterans as the number one threat
[01:45:34.280 --> 01:45:38.920]  i think they're exactly right uh but it doesn't it doesn't it says a lot more
[01:45:38.920 --> 01:45:43.400]  about them than it does us these are not americans these are not
[01:45:43.400 --> 01:45:49.080]  loyal americans these people who have usurped hijacked our government
[01:45:49.080 --> 01:45:54.680]  they have no loyalty to this country or to the american people
[01:45:54.680 --> 01:45:59.080]  good point you just said it it's hiding in plain view only a foreign enemy would
[01:45:59.080 --> 01:46:02.680]  hate our veterans only a foreign enemy would hate the tea
[01:46:02.680 --> 01:46:05.720]  party who are the most americana people out there
[01:46:05.720 --> 01:46:09.480]  because this is a takeover and we're the only americans left and we're being
[01:46:09.480 --> 01:46:13.720]  demonized the bottom line is this i'm like you
[01:46:13.720 --> 01:46:17.720]  pretty much i'm not looking for trouble but i think
[01:46:17.720 --> 01:46:21.160]  in your mind you have to have already made a decision that
[01:46:21.160 --> 01:46:25.560]  if the line is crossed whether it be a forced inoculation
[01:46:25.560 --> 01:46:29.880]  or or whatever you have to be ready to fight and die
[01:46:29.880 --> 01:46:34.040]  at the drop of a hat and i'm ready to do that i have no problem with dying
[01:46:34.040 --> 01:46:38.040]  uh in the heat of battle uh for a good cause i would rather make my
[01:46:38.040 --> 01:46:44.440]  opponent die and i would rather live but i have no problem with dying
[01:46:44.440 --> 01:46:47.480]  well i have to say i don't either i have total peace when it comes to it i just
[01:46:47.480 --> 01:46:49.880]  wanted everything i came before that happens and
[01:46:49.880 --> 01:46:53.320]  i think it was a blind spot because we've never had so many chicken hawks
[01:46:53.320 --> 01:46:58.040]  in government as we've had now that they have a blind spot there's a reason
[01:46:58.040 --> 01:47:00.760]  old timers that were mainly former generals and
[01:47:00.760 --> 01:47:04.200]  you know who'd been enlisted or you know you know been low-level officers in
[01:47:04.200 --> 01:47:07.400]  world war one or world war two or whatever didn't want to have nuclear
[01:47:07.400 --> 01:47:11.000]  wars didn't like big wars because they realized how dangerous it is
[01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:14.440]  we've got all these weird feminists now running the military and the state
[01:47:14.440 --> 01:47:17.000]  department who want to start wars with russia
[01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:20.600]  and are recorded you know just saying you know kill more russians or whatever
[01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:24.440]  they have a disconnect and i don't think they realize it's not just going to be
[01:47:24.440 --> 01:47:28.120]  good men dying fighting the patriots when all this kicks off
[01:47:28.120 --> 01:47:32.360]  people are going to be coming after them and i just hope all these tough
[01:47:32.360 --> 01:47:35.880]  bureaucrats understand that when all hell breaks loose
[01:47:35.880 --> 01:47:39.080]  i mean that that fighting men and i've never been in the military but i grew
[01:47:39.080 --> 01:47:41.160]  up in a lot of rough stuff in dallas and i know
[01:47:41.160 --> 01:47:44.200]  once somebody knocks me upside the head i don't care if they're twice my size
[01:47:44.200 --> 01:47:47.080]  i'm going to climb them beat the hell out of them i'm not scared once i'm going
[01:47:47.080 --> 01:47:51.560]  to fight quite frankly i enjoy it and and and and and so
[01:47:51.560 --> 01:47:53.960]  people understand that once this whole thing kicks off
[01:47:53.960 --> 01:47:57.080]  it's going to be hellish and you know the globalists think you're going to
[01:47:57.080 --> 01:48:01.800]  attack us and not get struck back at it's just going to be absolutely
[01:48:01.800 --> 01:48:05.080]  out of control and george soros is trying to kick it off
[01:48:05.080 --> 01:48:07.960]  with that internal memos come out where they plan to blame the patriots for
[01:48:07.960 --> 01:48:11.800]  false flags this is a great time to ask sheriff mac what is your line in the
[01:48:11.800 --> 01:48:14.520]  sand i think they can see that politically we're
[01:48:14.520 --> 01:48:16.680]  gaining ground and they're going to beat them down the road
[01:48:16.680 --> 01:48:21.080]  they see our trajectory they want to start i mean why would soros give 33
[01:48:21.080 --> 01:48:24.600]  million to riot on the police why are they trying to create racial division
[01:48:24.600 --> 01:48:28.680]  why are they demonizing the military what do you think's going on
[01:48:28.680 --> 01:48:33.560]  well there's no question that uh brock obama has uh had it as one of his main
[01:48:33.560 --> 01:48:37.320]  goals is to create more uh black white
[01:48:37.320 --> 01:48:41.240]  division in this country black white hate uh he's done nothing to bring this
[01:48:41.240 --> 01:48:45.000]  country together but uh this is this is it
[01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:48.440]  imagine now that all of this is happening and
[01:48:48.440 --> 01:48:52.360]  sheriffs stand with their citizens in civil disobedience
[01:48:52.360 --> 01:48:56.200]  that the sheriff is there now you've been part of civil disobedience before
[01:48:56.200 --> 01:49:01.320]  and it's been some amazing process imagine now every time you did that
[01:49:01.320 --> 01:49:05.560]  the sheriff is standing next to you my personal line in the sand i'm already
[01:49:05.560 --> 01:49:10.040]  getting death threats for and that is i will not take obama care
[01:49:10.040 --> 01:49:13.800]  and i had that heart attack and i didn't have insurance
[01:49:13.800 --> 01:49:18.040]  and now people are uh literally donating to the fund
[01:49:18.040 --> 01:49:23.160]  to help me with my medical bills and threatening to kill me at the same time
[01:49:23.160 --> 01:49:27.480]  that's how they that's how some of the liberal uh people work in this country
[01:49:27.480 --> 01:49:32.200]  i've also had some very touching uh liberal messages that have been really
[01:49:32.200 --> 01:49:36.040]  amazing uh but both my my wife and i uh
[01:49:36.040 --> 01:49:39.880]  have been very poor health lately and i'm feeling a lot better she's not doing
[01:49:39.880 --> 01:49:45.480]  as well as i am now but this is the thing i am not going to take obama care
[01:49:45.480 --> 01:49:50.600]  it's a globalist uh new world order forced inoculation
[01:49:50.600 --> 01:49:55.160]  forced uh abortion uh plan death panels
[01:49:55.160 --> 01:49:58.360]  yeah exactly and i'm not going to have anything to do with it i'm not going to
[01:49:58.360 --> 01:50:01.640]  take it even if it were to help me financially
[01:50:01.640 --> 01:50:05.560]  personally i'm not going to take it i'm not going to pay
[01:50:05.560 --> 01:50:09.000]  any fine to the irs i'm not going to jail
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:12.360]  so that's it and my other line in the sand is
[01:50:12.360 --> 01:50:18.280]  no more irs crimes that's it and we have got to have that line drawn with all
[01:50:18.280 --> 01:50:21.160]  the other sheriffs and peace officers in this country
[01:50:21.160 --> 01:50:25.160]  who draw the line with us and saying you're not taking any more
[01:50:25.160 --> 01:50:29.560]  bank accounts you're not going to conduct any more random audits
[01:50:29.560 --> 01:50:32.680]  and this is what we're going to have because this is a criminal political
[01:50:32.680 --> 01:50:38.360]  group that's been caught admittedly targeting patriots to destroy us
[01:50:38.360 --> 01:50:42.440]  yeah they've been caught a lot and they have a rap sheet a mile long
[01:50:42.440 --> 01:50:46.200]  and it's more like a thousand million light years long
[01:50:46.200 --> 01:50:49.160]  i mean it's even the new york times they just target innocent old women they've
[01:50:49.160 --> 01:50:52.520]  done nothing and all their money's been paid and taxed and they still just take
[01:50:52.520 --> 01:50:55.880]  everything they got i mean it's just it's their villains people

[01:55:18.120 --> 01:55:22.280]  banks are open now if you have a specific question for sheriff richard mac it's
[01:55:22.280 --> 01:55:28.280]  800-259-9231 800-2599-231 let's get
[01:55:28.280 --> 01:55:33.560]  in to the irs these other tyrannies i mean it's now naked open tyranny it
[01:55:33.560 --> 01:55:37.320]  seems like the bottom is falling out sheriff historically you know criminology
[01:55:37.320 --> 01:55:41.160]  better than i if you let criminal criminal activity run to a certain point
[01:55:41.160 --> 01:55:46.520]  there's no limit and it seems like the corruption is going to seed right now
[01:55:46.520 --> 01:55:50.200]  yeah that's exactly what's happening and there is a culture of criminal
[01:55:50.200 --> 01:55:54.280]  behavior within the irs and people just accept it and
[01:55:54.280 --> 01:55:58.840]  uh even the american people are uh what really is disconcerting is that
[01:55:58.840 --> 01:56:03.160]  congress has uh and the president it's well documented that
[01:56:03.160 --> 01:56:07.640]  presidents since fdr have used the irs as political hitman against their
[01:56:07.640 --> 01:56:11.240]  enemies and yet this is also accepted and the fbi has
[01:56:11.240 --> 01:56:14.680]  been used for that in some instances and the the irs
[01:56:14.680 --> 01:56:18.360]  has actually used uh the the fbi is uh
[01:56:18.360 --> 01:56:23.320]  complicit in some of their tyranny but this is all well documented and
[01:56:23.320 --> 01:56:26.840]  republicans shake their fingers that the irs and say oh we're going to defund
[01:56:26.840 --> 01:56:29.640]  you or whatever they don't do anything about it
[01:56:29.640 --> 01:56:35.640]  and and so it is absolutely the responsibility of the sheriff to do
[01:56:35.640 --> 01:56:39.560]  something about this in fact uh the book uh the book asked the
[01:56:39.560 --> 01:56:43.160]  question and alex i need to get this uh these two i can get you four or five
[01:56:43.160 --> 01:56:46.600]  cases real easy but this is the best book in america
[01:56:46.600 --> 01:56:49.880]  are you a david and you can see goliath in the background
[01:56:49.880 --> 01:56:54.200]  in defining who goliath is and that female sheriff on the front is one of
[01:56:54.200 --> 01:56:57.720]  our good constitutional sheriffs from texas not too far from you
[01:56:57.720 --> 01:57:02.280]  edwards county this is sheriff pamela elliot who is on our board
[01:57:02.280 --> 01:57:07.880]  and uh she's a tough uh uh former marine and uh she agreed to be on the the
[01:57:07.880 --> 01:57:12.200]  front cover to represent the true constitutional sheriff in this country
[01:57:12.200 --> 01:57:15.800]  who can help us avoid the violence that
[01:57:15.800 --> 01:57:19.560]  uh washington dc and the obama administration are trying to
[01:57:19.560 --> 01:57:25.080]  uh perpetrate in america today imagine now that we had literally a thousand
[01:57:25.080 --> 01:57:28.920]  sheriffs putting the federal government on notice especially irs
[01:57:28.920 --> 01:57:32.680]  and letting them know we will not allow
[01:57:32.680 --> 01:57:36.920]  any more of your crimes to occur in our counties and if you do
[01:57:36.920 --> 01:57:40.440]  we will take action against you somebody's got to put the brakes on
[01:57:40.440 --> 01:57:44.600]  someday i mean it even the new york times says something's got to be done
[01:57:44.600 --> 01:57:49.640]  and they love it uh so people are now going to get front row seats
[01:57:49.640 --> 01:57:52.680]  all these utilitarians that think big governments they're mommy
[01:57:52.680 --> 01:57:57.400]  they're going to find out no it's not it is solid tyranny
[01:57:57.400 --> 01:58:01.320]  and alex uh again i want to encourage all your listeners

[02:09:24.040 --> 02:09:27.800]  as radical as i used to sound talking about stuff now it's all come out so i'm
[02:09:27.800 --> 02:09:31.160]  not that radical true this was really radical i was just
[02:09:31.160 --> 02:09:34.360]  covering the truth people didn't know about it so it sounded crazy
[02:09:34.360 --> 02:09:39.240]  but now it's known nato funded al qaeda against syria
[02:09:39.240 --> 02:09:43.560]  and then they changed her name to isis it's known hillary shipped the missiles
[02:09:43.560 --> 02:09:46.600]  up to turkey to give them to the folks in syria
[02:09:46.600 --> 02:09:50.040]  uh and then she's asked about it in congress as she makes a joke and goes
[02:09:50.040 --> 02:09:53.800]  a turkey what's what do you mean a turkey a bird
[02:09:53.800 --> 02:09:59.080]  i played that clip earlier just just the craziness of
[02:09:59.080 --> 02:10:02.600]  of the president opening the borders and and ordering the board patrol to give
[02:10:02.600 --> 02:10:08.200]  them vouchers and ship illegals in and and and just all of it is so illegal i
[02:10:08.200 --> 02:10:12.440]  think what's next i mean more tyranny in a month and
[02:10:12.440 --> 02:10:17.080]  we see in years uh what do you expect to see happen next
[02:10:17.080 --> 02:10:20.840]  sheriff of all the subterfuge that you've pointed out and that i've
[02:10:20.840 --> 02:10:24.360]  pointed out and that you and i both have been assailed for
[02:10:24.360 --> 02:10:28.200]  uh we look more prophetic every day don't we when we discover these things but
[02:10:28.200 --> 02:10:33.960]  the alexa the sad thing of it is we have only uh discovered and
[02:10:33.960 --> 02:10:38.040]  exposed about one tenth of what's really going on
[02:10:38.040 --> 02:10:41.320]  the dangers and and perils at our border and the
[02:10:41.320 --> 02:10:45.880]  subterfuge uh and the corruption behind all of this that's going on
[02:10:45.880 --> 02:10:50.280]  internationally and at our own borders is 10 times worse
[02:10:50.280 --> 02:10:54.200]  than what you have exposed and what what i've talked about that's what i always
[02:10:54.200 --> 02:10:57.880]  say is people think i exaggerate and later it comes out it's it's it's
[02:10:57.880 --> 02:11:00.920]  worse if generally as you know in criminology i
[02:11:00.920 --> 02:11:04.280]  guess things are usually five 10 15 times worse than what you know
[02:11:04.280 --> 02:11:08.600]  and exactly if it's this bad and we know
[02:11:08.600 --> 02:11:16.040]  then then how much worse is it really it's a it's a lot worse uh and uh i
[02:11:16.040 --> 02:11:19.080]  believe that uh they don't care now what we know
[02:11:19.080 --> 02:11:22.600]  they think they can get away with anything and i'm betting
[02:11:22.600 --> 02:11:25.560]  that the sheriffs and peace officers of this country
[02:11:25.560 --> 02:11:31.800]  will stand and and stop this and again in a peaceful effective way well look at
[02:11:31.800 --> 02:11:34.600]  the conspiracy they militarized federalized police
[02:11:34.600 --> 02:11:37.800]  start doing psychologicals in the last 20 years to our thugs
[02:11:37.800 --> 02:11:40.760]  they then protect them take over departments when they get in trouble
[02:11:40.760 --> 02:11:44.840]  they federalize the department which has followed the globalist programming
[02:11:44.840 --> 02:11:48.280]  then the police get hated by the public they go into their own gang mentality
[02:11:48.280 --> 02:11:52.440]  their journey towards darkness is complete you and i and many others are
[02:11:52.440 --> 02:11:56.760]  battling for that heart and soul of the peace officer as jack mclan would always
[02:11:56.760 --> 02:12:00.040]  say tyranny will come to your door in a uniform
[02:12:00.040 --> 02:12:04.520]  but liberty can as well that fight is happening now
[02:12:04.520 --> 02:12:09.560]  it is and we're really uh needing everybody's help to take that battle
[02:12:09.560 --> 02:12:13.640]  to our nation's police and our sheriffs and it's amazing that we're having
[02:12:13.640 --> 02:12:19.400]  examples every day of sheriffs and uh chiefs of police stand chief chief
[02:12:19.400 --> 02:12:24.520]  james craig from detroit has actually said that gun ownership
[02:12:24.520 --> 02:12:30.120]  and gun owners has decreased crime and in that once crime ridden area that
[02:12:30.120 --> 02:12:33.960]  never saw a decrease in crime chicago just saw a drop after a few concealed
[02:12:33.960 --> 02:12:38.760]  carries got issued a few hundred i mean it's it's incredible it really is
[02:12:38.760 --> 02:12:41.640]  what about the fella in new mexico you were talking about and others there's
[02:12:41.640 --> 02:12:45.320]  all these sheriffs and police chiefs i mean we actually put up the albuquerque
[02:12:45.320 --> 02:12:49.240]  headline police chief stands up to irs or sheriff does i mean this is really
[02:12:49.240 --> 02:12:53.640]  happening sheriff london in eddie county
[02:12:53.640 --> 02:12:58.360]  where carlsbad caverns is located he has taken a strong stand
[02:12:58.360 --> 02:13:02.920]  against the irs and he's the one that has
[02:13:02.920 --> 02:13:06.440]  somewhat fired the first shot on this issue and
[02:13:06.440 --> 02:13:09.720]  we've already been talking about this issue with many of our sheriffs and our
[02:13:09.720 --> 02:13:14.680]  csp away staff and we're going to make this our calling card
[02:13:14.680 --> 02:13:18.920]  we've got to stop this congress won't do it the president of course is promoting
[02:13:18.920 --> 02:13:22.520]  it and we're going to do everything we can to protect
[02:13:22.520 --> 02:13:25.640]  the people of this country and let's be clear when the fed show up without
[02:13:25.640 --> 02:13:29.880]  warrants or the fed show or the irs shows up without warrants to grab a bank
[02:13:29.880 --> 02:13:33.240]  account or somebody's house it's the sheriff's job and by the way it's been
[02:13:33.240 --> 02:13:37.000]  sheriffs in florida and constables when when
[02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:41.240]  bank of america member got caught taking houses they never even had a deed to
[02:13:41.240 --> 02:13:46.440]  that were paid off the sheriffs went and said no we're now taking your bank and
[02:13:46.440 --> 02:13:49.320]  went in and we're taking cash out of the registers
[02:13:49.320 --> 02:13:52.840]  when they wouldn't pay the money back court order and so the bank finally
[02:13:52.840 --> 02:13:57.080]  wrote a check but i mean that's an example of of the police doing they'll
[02:13:57.080 --> 02:14:00.680]  be loved if they started doing the right thing
[02:14:00.680 --> 02:14:03.720]  and i talk about sheriff tom dart from chicago
[02:14:03.720 --> 02:14:07.560]  who isn't even a constitutional sheriff but he stood against the big banks and
[02:14:07.560 --> 02:14:11.320]  stopped for for closures in his county and he did the
[02:14:11.320 --> 02:14:15.080]  right thing just because he saw an abuse he's not on our list hasn't been
[02:14:15.080 --> 02:14:18.920]  any of our training but that's what we're really after we're after
[02:14:18.920 --> 02:14:22.360]  uh behavioral change from our nation's police and sheriffs
[02:14:22.360 --> 02:14:25.400]  and he is another example exactly and sheriffs run are tremendous pressure
[02:14:25.400 --> 02:14:30.200]  he's black he's a democrat but he will give to ice
[02:14:30.200 --> 02:14:33.400]  aggravated felons he should be given all the illegals they pick up for for even
[02:14:33.400 --> 02:14:37.800]  petty crimes to you know to be but he's only deporting you know 10 or so a week
[02:14:37.800 --> 02:14:41.480]  15 a week five a week it varies they're trying to unseat him right now with
[02:14:41.480 --> 02:14:45.880]  Bloomberg money in austin because he would just take a rapist
[02:14:45.880 --> 02:14:49.240]  to be deported i mean it's insane and that's another issue
[02:14:49.240 --> 02:14:55.080]  sheriff clark from Milwaukee i call him uh my brother and friend and you have
[02:14:55.080 --> 02:14:59.960]  also uh befriended him yeah you know what
[02:14:59.960 --> 02:15:05.080]  he's black and he's a democrat and uh they called you and me racist
[02:15:05.080 --> 02:15:08.920]  and yet uh sheriff clark has even said that
[02:15:08.920 --> 02:15:13.320]  how do you call these people racist i'm black did you know i was the only black
[02:15:13.320 --> 02:15:18.280]  sheriff in wisconsin and and so these labels that they try to throw out at
[02:15:18.280 --> 02:15:21.640]  you and me and others they just don't like common sense and people coming
[02:15:21.640 --> 02:15:24.760]  together common sense is right there against that
[02:15:24.760 --> 02:15:28.840]  so no this is a movement that's taking hold and we need all of you to get on
[02:15:28.840 --> 02:15:32.040]  board and and get your materials well we we have
[02:15:32.040 --> 02:15:35.800]  the books available at inforstore.com as well they're on your site take them to

[02:15:39.320 --> 02:15:41.960]  night or tomorrow wake up your police wake up your
[02:15:41.960 --> 02:15:44.760]  sheriffs today uh you know a plan to save the police
[02:15:44.760 --> 02:15:48.040]  save america i mean this is so serious let's go to ross in
[02:15:48.040 --> 02:15:51.400]  illinois you're on the air thanks for holding
[02:15:51.400 --> 02:15:54.840]  hey hey there how you doing today good brother
[02:15:54.840 --> 02:15:59.720]  hey i was calling in i was listening to the 82nd airborne guy
[02:15:59.720 --> 02:16:03.080]  say that uh this is a foreign takeover and it's obvious
[02:16:03.080 --> 02:16:06.520]  my big concern and question is i hear all you guys
[02:16:06.520 --> 02:16:10.200]  talk about you know what they're gonna job you're ready to die take my gun
[02:16:10.200 --> 02:16:13.480]  from i called that in they are going to attack
[02:16:13.480 --> 02:16:16.920]  and kill us all what the heck are we gonna do to stop it
[02:16:16.920 --> 02:16:20.760]  i mean if we wait till it they start shooting and rounding people up it's
[02:16:20.760 --> 02:16:24.760]  going to be too late how we're gonna fight against what the military you
[02:16:24.760 --> 02:16:28.120]  know they drop an Apache and with a couple of fires and it's over
[02:16:28.120 --> 02:16:31.560]  let me stop you ross and i'm gonna keep the sheriff with us into the next
[02:16:31.560 --> 02:16:34.200]  segment to get to all these calls and i'm gonna come back to you but let me
[02:16:34.200 --> 02:16:38.920]  just explain something um the county judge in Lubbock a
[02:16:38.920 --> 02:16:42.440]  major city in texas they call him judges he's the elected
[02:16:42.440 --> 02:16:44.760]  guy over the county's like that he's like the mayor of the county
[02:16:44.760 --> 02:16:47.640]  he said they prepared the police with armored vehicles
[02:16:47.640 --> 02:16:51.000]  to fight the un takeover and the gun confiscation
[02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:54.280]  okay texas judge warrants obama reelection could lead to civil war
[02:16:54.280 --> 02:16:58.680]  that's because the feds came to him and we've talked to him off air
[02:16:58.680 --> 02:17:02.360]  and basically told him i mean the feds have been to these
[02:17:02.360 --> 02:17:05.640]  cities and said will you go with us in a takeover
[02:17:05.640 --> 02:17:09.800]  that's why these people are saying this the military
[02:17:09.800 --> 02:17:15.320]  could not subdue iraq and afghanistan i will assure you with 180 million gun
[02:17:15.320 --> 02:17:18.680]  owners if one percent fights back that's 1.8 million people
[02:17:18.680 --> 02:17:21.880]  we don't want to have a war with the police the military it's why we're
[02:17:21.880 --> 02:17:26.440]  targeting them to wake them up okay to the globalist soros plan
[02:17:26.440 --> 02:17:29.880]  do you have any idea if one million combatants
[02:17:29.880 --> 02:17:33.720]  go out one time in a civil war and take out one
[02:17:33.720 --> 02:17:38.040]  operative of the system it will end you understand that sir i don't want to get
[02:17:38.040 --> 02:17:41.400]  into war making and special operations and i mean i've
[02:17:41.400 --> 02:17:44.440]  read probably let's not exaggerate 30 40 books on it
[02:17:44.440 --> 02:17:47.480]  everything from total resistance you know written in europe during world war two
[02:17:47.480 --> 02:17:50.760]  to what the russians did when the nazis came in the rest of it i mean do you have
[02:17:50.760 --> 02:17:55.320]  any idea that if we actually fight but that's part of the plan to destroy the
[02:17:55.320 --> 02:17:57.560]  military and police during the civil war
[02:17:57.560 --> 02:18:01.560]  to bring in after we're exhausted a year later the globalist forces
[02:18:01.560 --> 02:18:04.760]  we do not want to do this we're going to beat them too they try this
[02:18:04.760 --> 02:18:07.720]  but then they're going to be using nerve gas out of helicopters and everything
[02:18:07.720 --> 02:18:10.040]  else on us so we'll talk about hellfire missiles it's
[02:18:10.040 --> 02:18:14.920]  going to be nerve gas and bio weapons okay nerve gas and bio weapons sir
[02:18:14.920 --> 02:18:17.960]  and starvation and the power being turned off so if you really want to talk
[02:18:17.960 --> 02:18:21.080]  about how they're going to hit us i'll tell you okay and it's going to be hell
[02:18:21.080 --> 02:18:23.400]  on earth okay and we're trying to stop it
[02:18:23.400 --> 02:18:26.520]  there'll be a hundred million dead americans if there's a civil war and i'm
[02:18:26.520 --> 02:18:29.640]  not joking i'm sorry to be we have the sunshine project
[02:18:29.640 --> 02:18:31.560]  documents on what the globalists are planning
[02:18:31.560 --> 02:18:35.240]  helicopters with nerve gas flying grids killing everybody
[02:18:35.240 --> 02:18:38.920]  and they don't need pilots anymore they got drone helicopters ready
[02:18:38.920 --> 02:18:42.680]  sheriff i'm ranting give us your take on what i just said
[02:18:42.680 --> 02:18:47.320]  well it when the militia is called out it is for defense and we cannot do
[02:18:47.320 --> 02:18:50.920]  preemptive strikes and i am still going to dedicate my
[02:18:50.920 --> 02:18:54.280]  life my soul my heart my wife my family
[02:18:54.280 --> 02:18:58.120]  to keeping this peaceful and the sheriffs can do it and the local law
[02:18:58.120 --> 02:19:01.320]  enforcement county commissioners working locally
[02:19:01.320 --> 02:19:04.760]  we can build the barriers erect the barriers just as
[02:19:04.760 --> 02:19:07.880]  madison said we should be doing at the local level
[02:19:07.880 --> 02:19:11.400]  and i think that we're so prepared and ready that there's never
[02:19:11.400 --> 02:19:15.480]  that's right and if it all kicks off then we'll have leadership
[02:19:15.480 --> 02:19:18.920]  that has moral authority already in place but we don't want to go there
[02:19:18.920 --> 02:19:24.360]  but i was telling you we will a defeat it but b when the un force comes in
[02:19:24.360 --> 02:19:27.400]  all the gloves are off they're going to be nerve gassing people and so i want
[02:19:27.400 --> 02:19:29.880]  the police to hear that real good so if we fail
[02:19:29.880 --> 02:19:33.000]  in 10 years from now you're hiding out and getting nerve gassed
[02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:37.320]  just remember you got warned because i'm telling you folks that's the plan
[02:19:37.320 --> 02:19:40.680]  is to have a civil war where we kill the police and military when they attack us
[02:19:40.680 --> 02:19:44.440]  and then they bring in un forces later sheriff richard max our guests we're

[02:26:25.960 --> 02:26:30.120]  let's talk to Phil in Pennsylvania you're on the air.
[02:26:30.760 --> 02:26:35.720]  Hello can you hear me? Yep sure can. Hi Alex I've been a listener and a
[02:26:35.720 --> 02:26:40.120]  supporter of all the your show and the products uh also wanted to
[02:26:40.120 --> 02:26:43.480]  just basically touch on uh just just some of the key things that I've noticed
[02:26:43.480 --> 02:26:47.080]  from what you said to come true um I don't want to take too long here
[02:26:47.080 --> 02:26:50.280]  it's just as far as uh people you know need to be awake
[02:26:50.280 --> 02:26:53.800]  and have themselves you know getting their supplies so they're not
[02:26:53.800 --> 02:26:58.360]  left out with no food no water uh if you don't take care of yourself and your
[02:26:58.360 --> 02:27:01.400]  family you can't expect everything. And sure nothing may happen this year we
[02:27:01.400 --> 02:27:05.160]  hope not or nothing in five years but the globalists are digging in
[02:27:05.160 --> 02:27:09.160]  like it's the end of the world and they want us to be
[02:27:09.160 --> 02:27:13.080]  not self-sufficient dependent we need to be somewhat self-sufficient independent
[02:27:13.080 --> 02:27:16.760]  that's a great point. Sheriff Matt comments on what he just said.
[02:27:16.760 --> 02:27:20.360]  Yeah and I want to make sure that the last two or three callers go to our
[02:27:20.360 --> 02:27:23.960]  website so you can hear the the speech by Stuart Rhodes
[02:27:23.960 --> 02:27:28.200]  good friend of yours and mine from Oathkeepers the director of Oathkeepers
[02:27:28.200 --> 02:27:32.120]  he spoke at our convention this past September
[02:27:32.120 --> 02:27:36.040]  and he nailed all of this right on the head
[02:27:36.040 --> 02:27:39.560]  and so get his speech off of our website at cspoa.org
[02:27:39.560 --> 02:27:43.000]  there's the site you just showed it it is working it's up
[02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:46.680]  and so yeah you want to hear that speech from Stuart Rhodes
[02:27:46.680 --> 02:27:50.760]  regarding the military problems that we're facing and the forcing
[02:27:50.760 --> 02:27:55.400]  of our peaceful citizens into
[02:27:55.400 --> 02:28:00.200]  violence but anyway his speech nails it it's the best speech I've ever heard
[02:28:00.200 --> 02:28:03.800]  Stuart give. Absolutely I want Phil to have another comment but I wanted to ask
[02:28:03.800 --> 02:28:06.360]  Sheriff Matt this question before he's got to go
[02:28:06.360 --> 02:28:09.960]  the story on info wars.com feds preparing to invade Texas
[02:28:09.960 --> 02:28:13.720]  list state is hostile notice the conservative area Southern California
[02:28:13.720 --> 02:28:18.120]  is listed Utah and Texas and they say treat this as hostile
[02:28:18.120 --> 02:28:21.720]  they're trying to poo poo that now why would they list
[02:28:21.720 --> 02:28:25.880]  we know in all their manuals they list libertarians veterans as the enemy
[02:28:25.880 --> 02:28:31.560]  why would they list Texas and Utah? Because they're the two most conservative
[02:28:31.560 --> 02:28:35.080]  states you know that's pretty funny that they
[02:28:35.080 --> 02:28:39.000]  coincidentally are that makes me want to move back to Texas or Utah
[02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:43.000]  lived in both states and you know what the spirit of freedom
[02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:47.640]  and independence reigns in both states and that's exactly how every state should
[02:28:47.640 --> 02:28:49.880]  be. Well it shows the disconnect up at
[02:28:49.880 --> 02:28:53.640]  Homeland Security with all these you know former weathermen and people that
[02:28:53.640 --> 02:28:57.880]  admittedly basically run the show that they think giving the military maps
[02:28:57.880 --> 02:29:01.400]  listing Texas as the enemy and last year it was even on Fox News
[02:29:01.400 --> 02:29:04.840]  Badmouthing the founding fathers and saying George Washington wouldn't be
[02:29:04.840 --> 02:29:08.280]  welcome in today's army all that does is wake people up it
[02:29:08.280 --> 02:29:13.400]  shows that disconnect that arrogance. Yeah it really does and you know
[02:29:13.400 --> 02:29:17.000]  remember the Alamo that's still the cry in Texas
[02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:20.520]  and they were already talking about secession and boy that's looking more
[02:29:20.520 --> 02:29:23.240]  and more profitable. Phil I'm going to come back to you and

[02:35:01.880 --> 02:35:08.040]  crazy it's absolutely insane
[02:35:08.200 --> 02:35:13.000]  and because of technology and prosperity evil is being able to grow
[02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:16.760]  in parallel to freedom to the biggest it's ever been
[02:35:16.760 --> 02:35:20.600]  because normally there was such little energy and little food in cultures i've
[02:35:20.600 --> 02:35:24.920]  studied it from an anthropological view that if there was a little bit of
[02:35:24.920 --> 02:35:30.040]  tyranny it would hurt prosperity so much society would just fall apart
[02:35:30.040 --> 02:35:34.760]  but carl marx was right when he said that production would go up so high that
[02:35:34.760 --> 02:35:38.600]  the state would wither away because you wouldn't even you know need workers
[02:35:38.600 --> 02:35:42.040]  anymore except the eugenicists go further they say yeah we're just gonna get rid
[02:35:42.040 --> 02:35:44.520]  of people
[02:35:45.400 --> 02:35:49.400]  so the state's withering away because a new state's rising the technocrats
[02:35:49.400 --> 02:35:51.480]  you're like what do you mean it's withering away the state's getting
[02:35:51.480 --> 02:35:55.960]  bigger than ever well the power is being transferred to the spp the
[02:35:55.960 --> 02:36:00.520]  na u the pacific partnership i mean that's in the news now
[02:36:00.520 --> 02:36:05.320]  and no one's allowed to read it but leaks of it show it's just so draconi and i
[02:36:05.320 --> 02:36:08.280]  can't even believe it that's why congress is passing all these
[02:36:08.280 --> 02:36:11.640]  unconstitutional laws it's why there's all this power grabbing going on
[02:36:11.640 --> 02:36:15.400]  bobby rocracy's outside of law because they have to get it lined up with the
[02:36:15.400 --> 02:36:19.480]  treaties and then our politicians graduate to the
[02:36:19.480 --> 02:36:24.120]  global government level they're now all over europe
[02:36:24.120 --> 02:36:28.520]  appointing leaders of countries like italy
[02:36:29.080 --> 02:36:35.880]  bonito musolini was elected adolf hitler was elected
[02:36:35.880 --> 02:36:40.920]  and became dictatorial afterwards well musolini actually marched on romans
[02:36:40.920 --> 02:36:44.120]  up but then they had a quasi-election he was a dictator from the start but but
[02:36:44.120 --> 02:36:50.280]  hitler was elected
[02:36:50.280 --> 02:36:53.400]  and then they abolished the presidency and the chancellorship and simply had
[02:36:53.400 --> 02:36:57.640]  the furor which means the leader
[02:37:00.600 --> 02:37:05.640]  by any historical measurement we are let's say you're not supposed to push a
[02:37:05.640 --> 02:37:09.880]  car up past seven thousand rpms they've pushed the rpms up to 20
[02:37:09.880 --> 02:37:15.000]  thousand on the tyranny scale there hasn't never been a tyranny like this
[02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:19.640]  but parallel there's still a lot of freedom and they do that for one reason
[02:37:19.640 --> 02:37:23.960]  they want to pick people off slow they don't want to have an open fight
[02:37:23.960 --> 02:37:28.200]  they want to do it incrementally and they want to keep some of the prosperity
[02:37:28.200 --> 02:37:34.200]  there as a opiate as a stunning effect
[02:37:34.200 --> 02:37:37.880]  people look around they go hey i've got a full belly i can bottle the beer i want
[02:37:37.880 --> 02:37:41.640]  and uh you know sure i'm not making as much money as i used to sure my kids
[02:37:41.640 --> 02:37:45.240]  are on drugs sure the culture is falling apart sure i'm you know
[02:37:45.240 --> 02:37:48.680]  half our neighbors have brain tumors and you know ever but i'm okay and people
[02:37:48.680 --> 02:37:52.840]  are just kind of comfortable easing into hot water and splitting their
[02:37:52.840 --> 02:37:56.760]  wrists basically but it's coming to an end very
[02:37:56.760 --> 02:37:59.640]  soon that's why you see the system running around
[02:37:59.640 --> 02:38:03.080]  like chickens with their heads cut off getting ready
[02:38:03.080 --> 02:38:08.120]  and just demonizing anybody that wants to be free
[02:38:08.120 --> 02:38:13.080]  and all the stupid collectivist whose identity is hating white people are
[02:38:13.080 --> 02:38:16.760]  hating black people are being a feminist or just they're just they're just
[02:38:16.760 --> 02:38:20.840]  fools living on the end of america and when it all
[02:38:20.840 --> 02:38:24.520]  goes down they're going to organize into piranha like formations
[02:38:24.520 --> 02:38:27.560]  you can already go to pretty much any democrat and say i want to put gun owners
[02:38:27.560 --> 02:38:29.880]  in forced labor camps will say yeah i'm sick of them let's do it
[02:38:29.880 --> 02:38:33.240]  you've seen it in austin you've seen in california on video
[02:38:33.240 --> 02:38:36.360]  we're not editing this we're showing you everyone that's interviewed and half of
[02:38:36.360 --> 02:38:39.880]  them will say put gun owners in slave camps the others go well
[02:38:39.880 --> 02:38:44.760]  yeah maybe if obama wants it maybe one person out of tens against it
[02:38:44.760 --> 02:38:49.240]  and they'll go are you nuts are you crazy hey we want to abort children up to age
[02:38:49.240 --> 02:38:52.520]  five obama says it's good oh yeah we need to kill children of age five it's for
[02:38:52.520 --> 02:38:55.080]  obama and then one one woman goes oh my god
[02:38:55.080 --> 02:38:57.560]  it's crying what are you talking about this is crazy killed
[02:38:57.560 --> 02:39:00.840]  shows that's a normal person but see the liberals are all going look at her she
[02:39:00.840 --> 02:39:04.040]  didn't want to kill babies she's not liberal
[02:39:04.040 --> 02:39:11.720]  see they have no rudder they have no compass they have nothing
[02:39:12.680 --> 02:39:18.200]  they are nothing they've had their souls taken already
[02:39:18.200 --> 02:39:23.480]  and when the hammer drops 90 of this country was self-sufficient or
[02:39:23.480 --> 02:39:27.800]  somewhat so in the 1930s in the great depression now 10 percent
[02:39:27.800 --> 02:39:31.880]  or rural national studies look them up half of those are self-sufficient
[02:39:31.880 --> 02:39:35.320]  five percent self-sufficient versus 90 percent
[02:39:35.320 --> 02:39:38.440]  seven million people look at the university studies type in university
[02:39:38.440 --> 02:39:41.000]  studies seven million died in the great depression
[02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:46.440]  from malnutrition illnesses association with malnutrition
[02:39:46.440 --> 02:39:51.320]  90 percent seven million died and the population was only about 180 million
[02:39:51.320 --> 02:39:55.400]  then look at the demographics we have another
[02:39:55.400 --> 02:39:59.480]  depression hell will open why do you think the marines of the
[02:39:59.480 --> 02:40:03.240]  army trained to mow down zombies and drills the last six years
[02:40:03.240 --> 02:40:06.840]  because they got in trouble mowing down the general public wearing john deer
[02:40:06.840 --> 02:40:10.040]  hats that was the uniform john deer hat country outfits
[02:40:10.040 --> 02:40:13.960]  when they were coming to take over farms and the drills
[02:40:14.920 --> 02:40:17.640]  there it is researcher famine killed seven million in us during great
[02:40:17.640 --> 02:40:21.800]  depression
[02:40:23.800 --> 02:40:30.280]  oh man that's bad man we are sitting on top a giant tnt case with a
[02:40:30.280 --> 02:40:33.640]  bunch of gremlins running around flamethrowers beneath us
[02:40:33.640 --> 02:40:36.360]  and i'll just be honest like joe big said he's staying here till the end i've
[02:40:36.360 --> 02:40:39.560]  committed to do it i'm going to do it
[02:40:40.040 --> 02:40:46.120]  but man my my my flesh just says get out of here get out of the country now
[02:40:46.120 --> 02:40:50.600]  my flesh says man get down to the middle of nowhere
[02:40:50.600 --> 02:40:53.560]  go to new zealand the elite are all moving there for a reason
[02:40:53.560 --> 02:40:57.720]  they're going to leave that as a safe harbor but you know what i believe the
[02:40:57.720 --> 02:41:00.520]  blessings of god and my providence will leave me
[02:41:00.520 --> 02:41:04.600]  if i cower and leave and i want to stay in the fight it's what god wants me to
[02:41:04.600 --> 02:41:08.360]  do and so i just am putting my kids down on the table
[02:41:08.360 --> 02:41:12.200]  myself my treasure my name everything and i just put it in god's hands and turn
[02:41:12.200 --> 02:41:15.000]  it loose but man folks for new listeners out there and
[02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:20.040]  everybody making jokes over advice and army times and everything else my god

[02:41:29.800 --> 02:41:32.920]  all the corruption i mean you have any idea of what
[02:41:32.920 --> 02:41:37.960]  the real special forces people are up to it's horrible

[02:41:45.720 --> 02:41:50.840]  everything's not a joke and the reason you're so empty and so
[02:41:50.840 --> 02:41:54.280]  unhappy statistically is because you live lies and your
[02:41:54.280 --> 02:41:58.600]  subconscious brain doesn't like lies and it doesn't like you
[02:41:58.600 --> 02:42:02.600]  your conscious mind your ego all the bull your gut

[02:42:05.720 --> 02:42:09.720]  and
[02:42:09.720 --> 02:42:16.760]  and you're going to be a horrible enemy when things collapse by design
[02:42:16.760 --> 02:42:20.600]  you are going to organize into a giant throng of mindless scum
[02:42:20.600 --> 02:42:24.840]  like locust to come eat the flesh off my bones

[02:47:36.440 --> 02:47:41.320]  in the united states today where is reason per se where is reason at all
[02:47:41.320 --> 02:47:44.440]  you speak to a christian audience but i speak to your audience
[02:47:44.440 --> 02:47:48.680]  much broader than just those who believe that god is reason and by god
[02:47:48.680 --> 02:47:52.440]  i mean the word as john when one says in the beginning with the word and the
[02:47:52.440 --> 02:47:56.200]  word was with god and word was god that word word translates
[02:47:56.200 --> 02:48:00.200]  logos from logos we get logic from logos we get reason
[02:48:00.200 --> 02:48:04.520]  and where is reason where is that modicum of truth where is that common sense
[02:48:04.520 --> 02:48:07.800]  audience the stands firm and says where the hell
[02:48:07.800 --> 02:48:11.640]  is the reasonable argument and whatever they're they're doing out there
[02:48:11.640 --> 02:48:16.520]  it can't be it cannot be those a few to those of us who are
[02:48:16.520 --> 02:48:18.680]  listening to what it is that you're saying daily
[02:48:18.680 --> 02:48:21.960]  but there's anything reasonable what i wanted to touch on when i called
[02:48:21.960 --> 02:48:26.280]  originally wasn't just the logos in the biblical sense but logos in the very
[02:48:26.280 --> 02:48:31.160]  secular sense where's logic where's reason where did it vanish to
[02:48:31.160 --> 02:48:34.840]  did it disappear did it just die how can it die
[02:48:34.840 --> 02:48:38.520]  we're still alive and so if we're still alive and we're made in the image of god
[02:48:38.520 --> 02:48:42.520]  and god must very well be alive also i called because i wanted to touch on
[02:48:42.520 --> 02:48:46.120]  education because it ties back into what it was that you were saying earlier
[02:48:46.120 --> 02:48:50.360]  i don't want to go into it in any specific way but i wanted to say this
[02:48:50.360 --> 02:48:53.800]  last year i was accepted into the university of north texas and i was
[02:48:53.800 --> 02:48:57.560]  told that i was uh nominated for a rubber beat to lose fellowship
[02:48:57.560 --> 02:49:01.960]  and i was given a teaching fellows i don't say that because
[02:49:01.960 --> 02:49:06.120]  it's something that i want to brag about i won't say it because i'm a phd
[02:49:06.120 --> 02:49:10.040]  uh except no i'm accepted for a phd in art education
[02:49:10.040 --> 02:49:14.120]  but art is media and media has the power
[02:49:14.120 --> 02:49:17.800]  to tell a message or to tell a story and if it's going to tell the story then
[02:49:17.800 --> 02:49:20.600]  it needs to be a logical story it needs to be a reasonable story
[02:49:20.600 --> 02:49:25.800]  a reasonable story and that is logic or logos that is from god it needs to be
[02:49:25.800 --> 02:49:28.440]  reasonable if you're going to promote something
[02:49:28.440 --> 02:49:32.680]  ladies and gentlemen listeners of alex jones listeners of the word that is
[02:49:32.680 --> 02:49:35.720]  the spirit of god then by all means be reasonable
[02:49:35.720 --> 02:49:41.560]  don't be uh uh you know uh infected by the narrative that is being put out by
[02:49:41.560 --> 02:49:44.840]  well sure that's what they do that's why they put out disease art disease
[02:49:44.840 --> 02:49:48.520]  culture it's declassified is to create mental illness
[02:49:48.520 --> 02:49:53.320]  the system is there to ship drugs in to get you on drugs prescription anti legal
[02:49:53.320 --> 02:49:56.200]  the system is there to make you mentally ill and confused
[02:49:56.200 --> 02:49:59.960]  they put chemicals in the water to screw you up then they build the industries
[02:49:59.960 --> 02:50:03.080]  around countering the problem which only get you deeper into it
[02:50:03.080 --> 02:50:06.360]  it's the hegelian dialectic of problem reaction solution
[02:50:06.360 --> 02:50:10.360]  of making money off all points of the compass but making the money is only to
[02:50:10.360 --> 02:50:14.040]  control the energy symbol so that you can dominate the
[02:50:14.040 --> 02:50:16.920]  entire culture appreciate your call good to hear from you
[02:50:16.920 --> 02:50:21.000]  but you're right we have lost logos we have lost logic
[02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:25.320]  and people have now have evil logic the mental illness
[02:50:25.320 --> 02:50:28.520]  with crime stop is what dorge arwell called it
[02:50:28.520 --> 02:50:32.200]  to be able to have two different ideas simultaneously
[02:50:32.200 --> 02:50:35.160]  that's what people say oh look at alex's documentation
[02:50:35.160 --> 02:50:38.520]  he said brigade homeland's taken over their mission ended three years ago or
[02:50:38.520 --> 02:50:41.400]  whatever and of course it was it was reauthorized
[02:50:41.400 --> 02:50:44.520]  but they'll just play some game going look this article said it was a one year
[02:50:44.520 --> 02:50:48.200]  tour hoping people don't know how that works and
[02:50:48.200 --> 02:50:51.560]  just playing semantical games like bill clinton did
[02:50:51.560 --> 02:50:56.520]  saying it depends what the word is is they want a world of brain damaged

[02:54:23.240 --> 02:54:26.520]  globalists are a bunch of abortion loving eugenics loving
[02:54:26.520 --> 02:54:31.000]  murderers that put the military on do not treat list and nobody got in trouble
[02:54:31.000 --> 02:54:34.760]  it's just the documents came out they put them on list to kill them
[02:54:34.760 --> 02:54:38.920]  and they went oh it's just an accident and nothing stops i mean it's sick
[02:54:38.920 --> 02:54:43.000]  tom is a retired police officer what's your take on solutions to
[02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:47.640]  trying to save the country well i'm sorry i missed the opportunity to thank
[02:54:47.640 --> 02:54:50.680]  the sheriff and to wish him and his wife
[02:54:50.680 --> 02:54:54.840]  well i'm certain like the other officer that called earlier
[02:54:54.840 --> 02:55:01.000]  um who is feeling less than prideful in his former profession as am i at
[02:55:01.000 --> 02:55:05.400]  times that uh the sheriff is inspiring
[02:55:05.400 --> 02:55:09.320]  both of us as well as millions of other police
[02:55:09.320 --> 02:55:13.800]  who feel the same way um i hope he's listening
[02:55:13.800 --> 02:55:20.440]  so that he can he can hear that um i believe that uh those of us who
[02:55:20.440 --> 02:55:23.640]  really want to see uh the nobility and honor
[02:55:23.640 --> 02:55:28.760]  brought back to policing uh we'll see that day come
[02:55:28.760 --> 02:55:31.480]  and i think the sheriff will will play a large
[02:55:31.480 --> 02:55:35.640]  role in that as well as other people of his ilk
[02:55:35.640 --> 02:55:40.680]  um what i did want to say though for young officers that are out there
[02:55:40.680 --> 02:55:45.160]  there's still a lot of good ones out there um you know at first contact on
[02:55:45.160 --> 02:55:48.280]  the street you're always taught in the academy
[02:55:48.280 --> 02:55:53.320]  that the uniform rules the day and there's no exceptions to that
[02:55:53.320 --> 02:55:57.640]  as a uniformed officer when you're beat uh you have the right
[02:55:57.640 --> 02:56:03.080]  and in fact uh you're duty bound uh by your sworn oath uh to demand
[02:56:03.080 --> 02:56:08.920]  identification from any outside law enforcement uh individuals regardless
[02:56:08.920 --> 02:56:14.920]  of who they are fba i dea atf whomever they they claim to be
[02:56:14.920 --> 02:56:19.080]  and until you're satisfied and comfortable
[02:56:19.080 --> 02:56:23.960]  with who they are your investigation is not over
[02:56:23.960 --> 02:56:27.400]  and that's up to and including requesting
[02:56:27.400 --> 02:56:33.800]  picture id uh demanding proper credentials names of their supervisors
[02:56:33.800 --> 02:56:37.800]  search and seizure warrants i've confronted federal agents
[02:56:37.800 --> 02:56:41.320]  who claim to have search and seizure warrants they don't
[02:56:41.320 --> 02:56:45.800]  they don't even have the information and if they can't provide
[02:56:45.800 --> 02:56:49.560]  the proper information so that you're comfortable
[02:56:49.560 --> 02:56:54.120]  that they're credible in your mind uh you have every right
[02:56:54.120 --> 02:56:58.520]  and again your duty bound to order them to cease and assist
[02:56:58.520 --> 02:57:01.800]  their activity that's right and then things like this giant jade helm
[02:57:01.800 --> 02:57:06.040]  exercise in ten states quote with military and plain clothes
[02:57:06.040 --> 02:57:10.040]  doing suspicious things is about completely destroying that line of
[02:57:10.040 --> 02:57:13.160]  jurisdiction they admit they've gotten rid of posse
[02:57:13.160 --> 02:57:15.400]  commentatus and then now they're just trying to
[02:57:15.400 --> 02:57:19.320]  deny this is going on what do you think all of this accelerated
[02:57:19.320 --> 02:57:25.000]  power grabbing is about well i think it's just that i think it's a power
[02:57:25.000 --> 02:57:31.240]  grab uh just like animal farm uh power indeed it does corrupt
[02:57:31.240 --> 02:57:35.080]  and the more power that these individual agencies
[02:57:35.080 --> 02:57:40.600]  gain uh the more power they want and you know
[02:57:40.600 --> 02:57:45.560]  there's really nothing new under the sun when i talk about federal agencies
[02:57:45.560 --> 02:57:52.280]  i'm not talking about them against local agencies you have good and bad
[02:57:52.280 --> 02:57:58.360]  and in each jurisdiction you'll find that you'll have fantastic
[02:57:58.360 --> 02:58:04.680]  god-fearing good men and women in every federal agency and doesn't seem to be a
[02:58:04.680 --> 02:58:08.200]  nest though it's like either a nest of good guys or a nest of bad guys
[02:58:08.200 --> 02:58:12.120]  it's like it's just it's just different nest absolutely sure they'll
[02:58:12.120 --> 02:58:15.560]  congregate but it doesn't you can't look at
[02:58:15.560 --> 02:58:20.200]  any one individual agency and say that's where they've all congregated
[02:58:20.200 --> 02:58:24.840]  you've got little enclaves within each and every agency
[02:58:24.840 --> 02:58:28.760]  and really you know i look at the times that we're in now
[02:58:28.760 --> 02:58:32.040]  as an opportunity to really fair it out
[02:58:32.040 --> 02:58:35.080]  absolutely this is the animating contest of liberty
