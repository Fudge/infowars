[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:29.360]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:29.360 --> 00:38.640]  welcome my friends welcome it is Tuesday the 14th day of June 2011 and we're going
[00:38.640 --> 00:44.880]  to be live here for the next three hours we have Charlie Skelton joining us in
[00:44.880 --> 00:48.360]  30 minutes to give us a brief report from the London Guardian on his
[00:48.360 --> 00:55.160]  perspective a Bilderberg 2011 he's still in Switzerland having lost missed his
[00:55.160 --> 01:01.760]  flight yesterday I was very exhausted in the aftermath of covering Bilderberg
[01:01.760 --> 01:04.560]  and also being a New York yesterday I think overall it was a decent radio
[01:04.560 --> 01:08.240]  show but I was somewhat reflective we did cover a lot of news but nothing
[01:08.240 --> 01:13.320]  compared what we'll cover today I am completely energized and was chomping at
[01:13.320 --> 01:16.880]  the bit to get behind the microphone today we're going to cover some very
[01:16.880 --> 01:22.280]  weighty very serious issues dealing with the social engineers of our planet and
[01:22.280 --> 01:27.320]  exactly what is being set up so thank you so much for joining us today believe
[01:27.320 --> 01:33.600]  me this is a transmission that you are not going to want to miss that is the
[01:33.600 --> 01:40.120]  guess that we have on with us again is Charlie Skelton coming up in T-minus 30
[01:40.120 --> 01:43.280]  minutes we'll have wide open phones throughout the rest of broadcasts and
[01:43.280 --> 01:47.520]  also get into some other important health news in the third hour today but I do
[01:47.520 --> 01:53.440]  want to take a lot of phone calls today in the second and third hours we'll see
[01:53.440 --> 01:58.360]  if I get around to it time does fly when you're fighting tyranny and there is no
[01:58.360 --> 02:01.960]  rest when you're living in reality trying to live in reality it's it's a
[02:01.960 --> 02:09.040]  constant struggle to be aware of the artificial habitat that the social
[02:09.040 --> 02:14.920]  engineers have built for us humans it is the great human trait to alter your
[02:14.920 --> 02:20.680]  habitat more than a bird does building a nest or a monkey building a nest up in
[02:20.680 --> 02:25.160]  a tree humans have altered their environment to a great extent but the
[02:25.160 --> 02:29.080]  social engineers are more and more making the decisions about the type of
[02:29.080 --> 02:33.280]  environment we're going to live in and I don't want to be treated as an animal
[02:33.280 --> 02:39.200]  who is basically domesticated and used as a biological Android and then
[02:39.200 --> 02:44.160]  basically phased out and that's what the controllers of our globe have openly
[02:44.160 --> 02:48.280]  said that they're doing and more and more I want to shift into really
[02:48.280 --> 02:54.400]  exposing the fact that we are living in a false construct in the precursor to what
[02:54.400 --> 03:00.000]  you could call the insertion into a fully digital matrix more and more we're
[03:00.000 --> 03:06.520]  being fed disinformation lies manufactured adulterated food manipulated
[03:06.520 --> 03:12.680]  water all of these things are are are being biologically and chemically
[03:12.680 --> 03:18.920]  altered for reasons of lowering IQ overall cognitive ability and lowering
[03:18.920 --> 03:24.120]  fertility and humans are designed to see things on the surface on the face of it
[03:24.120 --> 03:28.440]  we're designed to live in an honest world and make honest common sense decisions
[03:28.440 --> 03:33.680]  and the globalist are manipulating blind spots like a magician does in the human
[03:33.680 --> 03:44.080]  psyche to basically jack in and hack the human firewall and turn off our basic
[03:44.080 --> 03:49.800]  hard-wiring for self-preservation and I'm here to simply try to get you to wake
[03:49.800 --> 03:53.120]  up and realize that you are being manipulated there is a war on for your
[03:53.120 --> 03:56.600]  mind that doesn't necessarily mean you have to believe in everything I talk
[03:56.600 --> 04:00.880]  about or or trust me in fact I don't want you to I want you to critically think
[04:00.880 --> 04:04.520]  about the ideas I bring forward research it for yourself and I think you'll find
[04:04.520 --> 04:09.240]  out I'm telling you the truth but from your life experiences in perspective you
[04:09.240 --> 04:13.040]  may see it from a slightly different angle and will undoubtedly add to my
[04:13.040 --> 04:18.920]  overall ideas themselves which are a cosmology of other basic truths and
[04:18.920 --> 04:23.320]  philosophical and environmental understandings through the history of
[04:23.320 --> 04:29.520]  humanity now now that I do have a bit more energy today in fact a lot more
[04:29.520 --> 04:32.680]  energy I do want to talk about some of things that happened at talkers because
[04:32.680 --> 04:36.120]  it was interesting to look at the development in new media from the
[04:36.120 --> 04:43.960]  perspective of talk radio and also what you could see is a vestigial section of
[04:43.960 --> 04:48.400]  what has grown into the alternative media we're also going to get into some of
[04:48.400 --> 04:51.960]  the new big developments dealing with the euro falling apart to the Financial
[04:51.960 --> 04:56.480]  Times of London today and we'll also get into a lot of key police state news
[04:56.480 --> 04:59.080]  stay with us

[06:21.960 --> 06:25.920]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[06:25.920 --> 06:30.280]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is

[08:29.640 --> 08:35.320]  third hour today London Guardian writer and investigative journalist Charlie
[08:35.320 --> 08:39.360]  Skelton will be joining us he's still in Switzerland in the aftermath of
[08:39.360 --> 08:44.600]  Bilderberg a lot of big reports there also out today at info wars.com and
[08:44.600 --> 08:50.000]  prisonplanet.com the globalist on their agenda from our moles have been
[08:50.000 --> 08:54.160]  desperate to keep the euro going because off the euro they then merged that
[08:54.160 --> 08:58.200]  with the North American Union and the Asian Union both already set up via
[08:58.200 --> 09:02.120]  stealth wiki leaks two weeks ago released more internal North American
[09:02.120 --> 09:07.040]  Union documents confirming what we broke down in my film in-game blueprint for
[09:07.040 --> 09:10.920]  global enslavement that were already in North American Union signed by secret
[09:10.920 --> 09:17.360]  treaty in 2005 and the headline is Bilderberg plan to save eurozone in
[09:17.360 --> 09:22.920]  tatters we're gonna be going over some of that today also militarily China
[09:22.920 --> 09:28.520]  rebukes US over South China Sea disputes and that's just some of the news we
[09:28.520 --> 09:33.360]  have on that front also militarily focus on Afghan war is shifting eastward as we
[09:33.360 --> 09:39.080]  told you it would towards Pakistan Japan City to give radiation counters to
[09:39.080 --> 09:46.680]  children we've got new news on fluorine and what's happening there we also have
[09:46.680 --> 09:52.400]  burlesone in a big defeat in Italy trying to hand over the infrastructure of
[09:52.400 --> 09:56.640]  Italy to foreign offshore banks quote privatization no it's just giving it to
[09:56.640 --> 10:00.360]  the global private banking cartel that acts as a government big defeat against
[10:00.360 --> 10:05.480]  the globalist in Austria they were going to privatize large sections of their
[10:05.480 --> 10:11.240]  Austrian Alps and give it to global consortiums as part of loan guarantees
[10:11.240 --> 10:15.360]  when Austria is incredibly wealthy this is just insiders in Austria trying to
[10:15.360 --> 10:19.880]  sign their country over that has failed a lot of positive things are happening
[10:19.880 --> 10:23.920]  against the globalist agenda across the world the attempt to privatize already
[10:23.920 --> 10:27.680]  paid for existing roads to foreign multinational corporations is failing
[10:27.680 --> 10:31.440]  I'm a free market guy this is not free market you wanted to have people vote to
[10:31.440 --> 10:35.480]  have a local company with total transparency and have bids take over
[10:35.480 --> 10:40.280]  roads that would be one thing but not when it's foreign banks coming in paying
[10:40.280 --> 10:43.920]  off your politicians and then they sign it over and then they basically triple
[10:43.920 --> 10:47.800]  the cost of the roads via the tolls as many of the studies have shown that is
[10:47.800 --> 10:51.920]  not the type of privatization we want see the globalist are good at taking
[10:51.920 --> 10:55.800]  labels that sound good and then putting them on bad things they're doing they
[10:55.800 --> 10:59.920]  call the Patriot Act patriotic it's the opposite they call a planned mass drug
[10:59.920 --> 11:04.360]  half of the population in their own documents the new freedom initiative
[11:04.360 --> 11:12.040]  they call all these horrible things they do they give them wonderful sounding
[11:12.040 --> 11:21.080]  little names but again my friends it is Tuesday the 14th day of June 2011 and I
[11:21.080 --> 11:29.080]  want to first get into the takeover system happening worldwide to what we
[11:29.080 --> 11:37.840]  know of as the internet that has now become the almost total commerce system
[11:37.840 --> 11:44.080]  of the planet it is becoming our civilization and I want to integrate
[11:44.080 --> 11:53.040]  that in to the spying systems that are piggybacked in the on-star systems the
[11:53.040 --> 12:03.560]  cell phones the toll road tag tracking boxes the cable boxes the Teavos the DVR
[12:03.560 --> 12:10.520]  all of it the quote smart homes not of the future but that are now being put
[12:10.520 --> 12:20.360]  into place when you purchase a washer a dryer a audio video system all of it is
[12:20.360 --> 12:25.760]  is having piggybacked into its surveillance two-way systems and you're
[12:25.760 --> 12:29.720]  paying for it and you're not being warned about it it's just becoming
[12:29.720 --> 12:36.560]  ubiquitous it's it's it's being engineered system-wide in the society and
[12:36.560 --> 12:46.560]  there's a constellation of articles the last few days that illustrate this the
[12:46.560 --> 12:52.080]  Pentagon is calling for tens of billions of dollars worldwide then this is being
[12:52.080 --> 12:58.680]  reported on with a straight face to build quote private networks in Eastern
[12:58.680 --> 13:05.000]  Europe China Latin America and in the United States for quote dissonant
[13:05.000 --> 13:16.080]  groups so that governments can't clamp down on dissonance now this is the same
[13:16.080 --> 13:20.400]  time while they're trying to brand anyone that criticizes the banking cartel
[13:20.400 --> 13:27.040]  looting 27 plus trillion dollars engineering a depression on record why
[13:27.040 --> 13:30.920]  would they be building that well really what it is is a network for their
[13:30.920 --> 13:36.360]  armies of millions of private spy contractors in the US over a million
[13:36.360 --> 13:41.880]  conservatively millions of private contractors worldwide this is the new
[13:41.880 --> 13:47.040]  economy the banks have unlimited tax money from we the people to to to to
[13:47.040 --> 13:51.720]  hire the mercenaries they need at every level of society and the way they can
[13:51.720 --> 13:55.600]  part mentalize these mercenaries most of them don't even know that they're
[13:55.600 --> 14:00.320]  mercenaries also these new internet to grids they've built through
[14:00.320 --> 14:07.600]  universities fortune 500 also then have the snooping software the the gate
[14:07.600 --> 14:12.800]  keeping grids the control systems to shut off parts of the web or the entire
[14:12.800 --> 14:18.840]  web but more importantly deliver their propaganda to you by shutting off the
[14:18.840 --> 14:23.000]  internet as you know it and redirecting you to only approved sites that display
[14:23.000 --> 14:26.800]  government messages that was announced two and a half years ago during the flu
[14:26.800 --> 14:32.480]  outbreak headline government looked at shutting off entire web and redirecting
[14:32.480 --> 14:37.880]  everyone to a White House announcement on flu at the CDC remember that headline
[14:37.880 --> 14:44.080]  in fact let's try to search that government looked at shutting off web
[14:44.080 --> 14:47.920]  during flu emergency that'll be the headline and then deeper it said well
[14:47.920 --> 14:51.720]  it wouldn't be shut off you would only get government messages and how they're
[14:51.720 --> 14:56.280]  gonna do this is they're gonna slowly phase it in where oh I want to get to
[14:56.280 --> 15:00.480]  that hot new video site I've got to sign up that's on the new internet it's the
[15:00.480 --> 15:04.600]  new cool thing oh I want to subside on that site I've got to sign on and agree
[15:04.600 --> 15:08.520]  to waive my rights and agree to give them my copyright and agree to give them
[15:08.520 --> 15:13.400]  control over me so they're creating really a false commons that sounds
[15:13.400 --> 15:17.640]  libertarian but isn't so they can control it and and and and track it with
[15:17.640 --> 15:21.880]  the algorithm and then as revolution worldwide mounts towards this they've
[15:21.880 --> 15:26.400]  already got their pre-deployed activists and spies in every city in every town of
[15:26.400 --> 15:33.000]  every country fully funded who have their own communications network outside of
[15:33.000 --> 15:37.440]  the web so the globalist can shut the web off or desperate nations will shut
[15:37.440 --> 15:42.000]  the web off during these over throws and then only their operatives will be able
[15:42.000 --> 15:50.840]  to be active and again this is not this is not a dumb down radio show here
[15:50.840 --> 16:03.600]  where I simply get up here and go oh look Obama says my family would be fine
[16:03.600 --> 16:08.160]  with just one term and hints of him not running again because he's falling like
[16:08.160 --> 16:14.000]  a fallen star oh you know look at how they're
[16:14.000 --> 16:20.400]  dumbing down the debates where they ask him what their favorite type of chicken
[16:20.400 --> 16:27.240]  wing is last night sure all of that's important but compared to the major
[16:27.240 --> 16:31.520]  technological changes taking place
[16:31.520 --> 16:42.320]  compared to the fact that the people running the global transformation are
[16:42.320 --> 16:47.600]  cunning are ruthless and in all of their major publications talk about how much
[16:47.600 --> 16:54.960]  they hate us and how the general public is a disease and a parasite and needs to
[16:54.960 --> 17:00.680]  be wiped out and then you study history in every culture whether it was the
[17:00.680 --> 17:04.760]  Japanese or whether it was the Chinese or whether it was Mesoamericans or
[17:04.760 --> 17:07.920]  whether it was Druids or whether it was the Romans or whether it was the
[17:07.920 --> 17:17.160]  Israelites or whether it was the the Rus the Norse Russian Rus red red hair
[17:17.160 --> 17:22.960]  founded by Vikings oh yeah their longboats went into China
[17:22.960 --> 17:35.520]  it is a human trait by elites if they have an enemy to kill everyone so this
[17:35.520 --> 17:44.440]  isn't a new idea it is simply an old idea manifest with a high-tech grid now
[17:44.440 --> 17:48.640]  now folks if you're a longtime listener you heard me 15 years ago was a guest on
[17:48.640 --> 17:54.400]  your local radio station and you you go man this guy really sounds crazy but I
[17:54.400 --> 17:59.960]  heard him 10 years ago talk about so much of what's now actually happened I
[17:59.960 --> 18:04.240]  better listen that's right you better listen because everything I talk about
[18:04.240 --> 18:11.160]  is supported by mountains of admissions but all of those admissions are
[18:11.160 --> 18:17.400]  packaged with a very thin spin on them to make them palatable and they package
[18:17.400 --> 18:22.800]  these things with only a thin candy coating because they want to acclimate
[18:22.800 --> 18:30.640]  you to accept it I remember getting up on air 15 years ago and talking about
[18:30.640 --> 18:37.320]  human cloning and the fact that it had already been done and getting calls and
[18:37.320 --> 18:43.600]  emails saying you are a lunatic liar and I had BBC and I had Durspegel and
[18:43.600 --> 18:48.720]  other reports where they said yes we did clone humans this company that company
[18:48.720 --> 18:53.680]  they did it in South Korea they did it in Costa Rica here's the company that's

[19:37.440 --> 19:41.240]  or it might have been when I was on with Punnett they pulled it up and went wow
[19:41.240 --> 19:44.920]  that there is the Washington Post because they weren't showing people the
[19:44.920 --> 19:51.360]  human z's but but they were there I but see now we talk about that it's like so

[24:29.840 --> 24:36.440]  on Hong Kong cars now you see when I read an article like this I've already
[24:36.440 --> 24:42.880]  looked at what multiple US insurance companies for at least seven years have
[24:42.880 --> 24:48.000]  been paying their customers by giving them discounts on the cost of their
[24:48.000 --> 24:53.000]  insurance I've already studied what's going in US cars I've already studied
[24:53.000 --> 24:58.800]  what the Department of Transportation in major cities across the United States
[24:58.800 --> 25:03.960]  including Austin where I live for at least two years have been paying people
[25:03.960 --> 25:13.520]  in Austin at 600 bucks a year to have a satellite tracker box in their car that
[25:13.520 --> 25:20.040]  simulates taxing them by the mile and I've looked at the different boxes
[25:20.040 --> 25:28.400]  they're using and it is basically the same configuration of this one I remember
[25:28.400 --> 25:33.720]  15 years ago knowing that most cars manufactured in Europe Japan the United
[25:33.720 --> 25:39.520]  States had a tracker box in them that tracked how fast you were driving where
[25:39.520 --> 25:44.000]  you were going basically what happened now it's law that those being the cars
[25:44.000 --> 25:48.760]  I'm not saying who look I knew all this it's just I get up on air and I tell you
[25:48.760 --> 25:54.200]  this stuff is becoming universal and when I tell you what the real use of
[25:54.200 --> 25:59.840]  these is understand I know what I'm talking about okay and this is just one
[25:59.840 --> 26:05.920]  thing of hundreds just like I knew in 96 that by October 1st 2000 all cell phones
[26:05.920 --> 26:11.440]  would be satellite triangulated GPS and would listen to you remotely even when
[26:11.440 --> 26:17.280]  the phone is off now they've announced it to the slaves oh it was crazy 15 16
[26:17.280 --> 26:22.840]  years ago just like telling you about clones was crazy now it's not there's a
[26:22.840 --> 26:27.360]  breakaway civilization and we know it's there we don't know exactly what it's
[26:27.360 --> 26:32.880]  doing but we know it's more advanced than what we're living in and what is
[26:32.880 --> 26:37.800]  doled out to us from behind the corporate multinational
[26:37.800 --> 26:42.400]  technocracy through the governments and and through the corporate subsidiaries
[26:42.400 --> 26:50.840]  of the monopoly men all has a use that we're told we're paying for but we're
[26:50.840 --> 26:57.920]  really paying for the main use our use of Google our use of cell phones that's
[26:57.920 --> 27:05.120]  all secondary these are guardian spies guardian devils in their own words to
[27:05.120 --> 27:08.640]  quote predict the future Google eight years ago brags soon they'd be able to
[27:08.640 --> 27:12.320]  predict the future last year they brag they can predict 93% of the time
[27:12.320 --> 27:16.000]  exactly where you're going to go before you do it they know what you're going to
[27:16.000 --> 27:21.320]  search before you do it because they already have a complete psychological
[27:21.320 --> 27:25.840]  profile and algorithm on you now they're telling you they got 93% on
[27:25.840 --> 27:33.560]  individuals on mass movements Google now has 99 and I believe them when they say
[27:33.560 --> 27:38.760]  this 99% they had a Philip K. Dick book day a few years ago turn into a movie I
[27:38.760 --> 27:44.800]  forget the name but I saw it you know where the guy gets hired to go work at
[27:44.800 --> 27:51.640]  company to reverse engineer something and it's a Russian time machine you're
[27:51.640 --> 27:55.200]  not able to go into the future you're able with the lenses to see into the
[27:55.200 --> 28:00.800]  future and then they erase his memory but then pieces of it come back and then
[28:00.800 --> 28:04.280]  basically he discovers it's gonna cause World War three that's why a bunch of
[28:04.280 --> 28:08.640]  his friends and people get killed by the big industrial technology company
[28:08.640 --> 28:13.920]  that's developed it well they can't predict the physical future of the
[28:13.920 --> 28:18.760]  dimension we're in but they can predict human activity so that's the big
[28:18.760 --> 28:23.200]  secret holy grail that they don't want you to talk about it two years ago Bob
[28:23.200 --> 28:26.480]  Wooder wrote a book saying there's all these secret technologies that are
[28:26.480 --> 28:30.920]  breathtaking that are godlike I'm not going to tell you what they are but we
[28:30.920 --> 28:35.760]  don't need you Bob Mr. Naval Intelligence to tell us we know they're
[28:35.760 --> 28:43.320]  multifaceted they are infrared satellite blimp and drone systems that on the
[28:43.320 --> 28:48.280]  street off of your face scan from your driver's license photo they get an idea
[28:48.280 --> 28:53.520]  of who you are then they geolocate as you're moving only takes once outside
[28:53.520 --> 28:57.320]  the satellite if you're a person of interest but everyone is in the process
[28:57.320 --> 29:02.480]  of being cataloged they get the the infrared signature on the top of your
[29:02.480 --> 29:07.160]  head and shoulders even through clothes okay and then now you're a hundred
[29:07.160 --> 29:10.440]  percent identifiable they also have the street level face scanners but again
[29:10.440 --> 29:18.160]  that's that's only one level they also get your 360 bioscan at the airport to
[29:18.160 --> 29:24.120]  then even if you wear a mask they have radio transmitter fluctuators basically
[29:24.120 --> 29:27.920]  sonar that shoot through your clothes or mask and know who you are from a
[29:27.920 --> 29:32.400]  biometric reading of the chest the shoulders the face they can they create
[29:32.400 --> 29:36.200]  a mathematical calculation you know what I got started on this and didn't even
[29:36.200 --> 29:39.720]  get into the meat and potatoes they just admit that they tell you that it's a
[29:39.720 --> 29:44.560]  toll road tracking box in China and in Hong Kong and it really has a built-in
[29:44.560 --> 29:49.160]  microphone other systems they have AI Google NSA software listening to you
[29:49.160 --> 29:55.680]  with a ride back we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the
[29:55.680 --> 29:59.120]  GCN radio network
[30:01.040 --> 30:05.800]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[30:05.800 --> 30:11.480]  is our last chance to not relive history as a finishing off this agenda that we
[30:11.480 --> 30:15.080]  pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've turned members
[30:15.080 --> 30:20.120]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[30:20.120 --> 30:25.480]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[30:25.480 --> 30:30.400]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[30:30.400 --> 30:34.800]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world

[30:38.520 --> 30:42.480]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[30:42.480 --> 30:48.040]  like nobody does care right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of

[33:23.320 --> 33:42.560]  If you're watching us at prisonplanet.tv that's a clip from a music video that
[33:42.560 --> 33:46.280]  some of the activists made out there with the European band behind it talking
[33:46.280 --> 33:52.560]  about the Illuminati with footage of the Bilderberg attendees rolling in and
[33:52.560 --> 33:59.680]  that's embedded in an article by Paul Joseph Watson titled Bilderberg plan to
[33:59.680 --> 34:08.640]  save the eurozone in tatters so again thank you for joining us today I'm gonna
[34:08.640 --> 34:14.280]  get back into the fact that all major technologies not just cell phones not
[34:14.280 --> 34:22.800]  just boxes and cars but washing machines dryers lighting systems everything is
[34:22.800 --> 34:29.120]  being globally standardized to spy on you and to control you and to yes even
[34:29.120 --> 34:34.080]  manipulate your mind and so we're gonna be breaking that down with the headline
[34:34.080 --> 34:38.560]  here that I mentioned earlier Chinese spying devices installed on Hong Kong
[34:38.560 --> 34:44.840]  cars and that integrates with US underwrites internet deter around sensors
[34:44.840 --> 34:50.760]  it's the opposite of that New York Times reporting also we've got to the
[34:50.760 --> 34:56.600]  report FBI expands agents investigative power not Congress but the FBI their new
[34:56.600 --> 35:00.080]  manual says no Fourth Amendment they can spy on you without a warrant
[35:00.080 --> 35:06.080]  investigate people for no probable cause just fishing expeditions and search
[35:06.080 --> 35:10.960]  your garbage or break into your house under sneak a peek just absolute
[35:10.960 --> 35:15.160]  complete Stasi and by the way that's out of the New York Times as well they say
[35:15.160 --> 35:19.960]  how wonderful it is also they have the new federal alerts that I told you the
[35:19.960 --> 35:23.520]  feds aren't taken seriously everybody knows and you've had the White House
[35:23.520 --> 35:27.960]  have to admit under Bush they were issuing them for fake political purposes
[35:27.960 --> 35:31.680]  to scare people but they've learned if they send out tailored local reports
[35:31.680 --> 35:34.960]  that have your name your county but really the same report goes out
[35:34.960 --> 35:39.320]  nationwide then the sheriff comes out all scared saying these Ron Paul people
[35:39.320 --> 35:43.520]  are gonna blow stuff up you know these these gun owners that we've got
[35:43.520 --> 35:48.000]  domestic terrorists in Bandera outside Austin they're gonna hit us and they're
[35:48.000 --> 35:51.000]  going to say we have no evidence these terrorists that believe in freedom are
[35:51.000 --> 35:56.920]  here but they're good but but and the sheriff is really scared in that video
[35:56.920 --> 36:02.280]  we played yesterday he was this is scary we got what's the quote we have
[36:02.280 --> 36:06.680]  domestic terrorism right here at our doorstep and then we get the manuals
[36:06.680 --> 36:09.880]  that they've been given by the feds and it's these people one out of the UN
[36:09.880 --> 36:12.840]  these people don't like the Bilderberg group these people don't like the
[36:12.840 --> 36:16.320]  private fellow reserve owned and run by the big private banks that they're
[36:16.320 --> 36:22.760]  gonna blow stuff up any minute the cops are all scared this is what you have a
[36:22.760 --> 36:27.480]  criminal government run by these mega corporations you see Charlie Skelton had
[36:27.480 --> 36:30.080]  a line in his latest article we're going to him here in a moment from
[36:30.080 --> 36:33.760]  Switzerland London Guardian reporter he said the most of the protesters weren't
[36:33.760 --> 36:38.880]  anti-government in Switzerland they were anti-anti-government and I don't want to
[36:38.880 --> 36:42.840]  say that's an oversimplification but to counter the simplification that were
[36:42.840 --> 36:47.560]  anti-government it counters it with an oversimplification and actually makes it
[36:47.560 --> 36:53.920]  true we are anti these governments that are corporate hijacked by non-free market
[36:53.920 --> 36:59.640]  monopoly men who openly use government to privatize through fraud I mean it's
[36:59.640 --> 37:03.360]  not privatization when Don Carleone comes and threatens that you need to
[37:03.360 --> 37:07.800]  sell that your profitable grocery store to him or he'll kill your daughter and
[37:07.800 --> 37:11.400]  then you sell it to him for ten cents on the dollar that's basically what
[37:11.400 --> 37:15.400]  globalism is we don't have a choice so if we can use government as a counter
[37:15.400 --> 37:19.160]  balance to the corporate global government that operates as a government
[37:19.160 --> 37:22.720]  but is corporate then that's a good thing I'm for constitutional government
[37:22.720 --> 37:27.600]  designed to stop monopolies from forming but he really had amazing
[37:27.600 --> 37:30.440]  reporters you've been reporting now the last three years he's been arrested
[37:30.440 --> 37:37.080]  before covering it for absolutely no reason and he joins us he is an Oxford
[37:37.080 --> 37:42.080]  University graduate as a journalist and he's written for the evening standard
[37:42.080 --> 37:45.240]  the Guardian and he's also written a number of television programs including
[37:45.240 --> 37:49.840]  10 o'clock live eight out of ten cats he is also a script editor of both and it
[37:49.840 --> 37:55.240]  just goes in he was written for MTV Europe of the London News Review and he
[37:55.240 --> 38:01.240]  founded the Clacton Festival as I'm pronouncing that right and he's covered
[38:01.240 --> 38:04.920]  Bilderberg group and you can just find him by typing Bilderberg into Google
[38:04.920 --> 38:09.880]  News and it's one of the top links and he joins us now been dominating the
[38:09.880 --> 38:15.360]  drudge drudge lit agendas up there doing a great job and to give us his view on
[38:15.360 --> 38:21.840]  Bilderberg 2011 wasn't a watershed year did the damn break globally on coverage
[38:21.840 --> 38:25.360]  as many reporters are pointing out did they leave earlier
[38:25.360 --> 38:31.400]  torch bearing peasants literally literally came to the gates in a
[38:31.400 --> 38:36.600]  satirical happy birthday David Rockefeller this this was a day long
[38:36.600 --> 38:40.600]  remembered wasn't it I think it absolutely was and I think I would just
[38:40.600 --> 38:44.000]  like to say about the birthday celebrations of David Rockefeller which
[38:44.000 --> 38:47.560]  they were they were they were rather nice they were rather sweet nothing the
[38:47.560 --> 38:50.960]  atmosphere they were they were flaming torches but the atmosphere was very
[38:50.960 --> 38:57.160]  jolly it was very peaceful and it was very switched on and very connected and
[38:57.160 --> 39:01.240]  very intelligent and you know you spend you spend four or five days in around
[39:01.240 --> 39:06.000]  Bilderberg and you just meet the the most clued up intelligent people in the
[39:06.000 --> 39:10.000]  world really the young guys the young girls who are there they're doing an
[39:10.000 --> 39:14.080]  amazing job they really are so that's what scares the system that's what
[39:14.080 --> 39:19.160]  scares the system so much happened let's chronicle for us what happened in the
[39:19.160 --> 39:25.200]  four days oh my goodness yeah I'm in my sleep deprived so forgive me if I get
[39:25.200 --> 39:29.520]  some of this in the wrong order well I mean obviously that a couple of the big
[39:29.520 --> 39:33.920]  things happen one is that the Swiss media really set up and took notice
[39:33.920 --> 39:40.360]  because you know the I don't think the average Swiss person particularly like
[39:40.360 --> 39:47.600]  to warms to the Bilderberg agenda of you know large super supranational bodies
[39:47.600 --> 39:52.800]  and diminishing of national boundaries etc etc national sovereignty and which is
[39:52.800 --> 39:56.200]  what I think of the point I was making about you know the fact that the people
[39:56.200 --> 40:00.200]  under anti-government outside I mean it's possible that people look at the
[40:00.200 --> 40:03.720]  people outside Bilderberg and think oh my god look at those bunch of I don't know
[40:03.720 --> 40:07.640]  spinking anarchists or whatever you think but actually there's a weird
[40:07.640 --> 40:12.640]  tension between what not wanting massive totalitarian government obviously as
[40:12.640 --> 40:18.600]  you say and not wanting your your functioning national democracy dissolved
[40:18.600 --> 40:24.800]  by huge powerful corporations and strange you know supranational bodies so
[40:24.800 --> 40:29.040]  basically I think that the Bilderberg this year seem to be as you said just as
[40:29.040 --> 40:31.840]  you came into this it seems to be asking a question the question is what kind of
[40:31.840 --> 40:35.600]  government do you want yeah I don't have the answer necessarily but it's not the
[40:35.600 --> 40:40.360]  one that they're pushing for and we know from decades and decades of their
[40:40.360 --> 40:44.440]  minutes being snuck out by the books written by Bilderberg attendees you had
[40:44.440 --> 40:48.200]  some of those quotes in your articles where they say we want a global corporate
[40:48.200 --> 40:52.600]  government or we can do whatever we want and there's absolutely no checks and
[40:52.600 --> 40:57.280]  balances and they even have a famous quasi libertarians there like the founder
[40:57.280 --> 41:03.040]  of PayPal and of course Bilderberg loves one strain of libertarianism the idea
[41:03.040 --> 41:07.560]  that if it's corporate they can do whatever they want but but really these
[41:07.560 --> 41:11.760]  corporate systems are operating as authoritarian governments and is the
[41:11.760 --> 41:16.200]  opposite of libertarian it's the opposite of transparency that's why
[41:16.200 --> 41:20.680]  they're hiding out in secret that's why they're hiding what they're doing yeah
[41:20.680 --> 41:24.720]  and the word there is transparency and that's what I keep going on about this
[41:24.720 --> 41:28.760]  year it's that you know we we like to think of ourselves as moving towards a
[41:28.760 --> 41:32.440]  world war you know perhaps we'd like to think of it as moving towards a world of
[41:32.440 --> 41:35.800]  transparency and government of accountability of you know we have
[41:35.800 --> 41:39.400]  and you know freedom of information requests of politicians having to kind
[41:39.400 --> 41:43.880]  of clean up their act all of this kind of thing and yet Bilderberg is this
[41:43.880 --> 41:51.360]  weird anachronism it feels it feels last century you know the closed doors and
[41:51.360 --> 41:56.360]  the the corporate bosses meeting with finance ministers in secret and you look
[41:56.360 --> 42:00.880]  at that and you just it leaves a slightly bad taste in the mouth I just kind of
[42:00.880 --> 42:05.000]  don't want to be have my politicians behave like that I'd like them to behave
[42:05.000 --> 42:09.040]  like I don't well you're absolutely right and you know even with the four-year
[42:09.040 --> 42:13.280]  request since they set up the national security systems in the US and England
[42:13.280 --> 42:18.240]  in the last 65 years and in Europe's adopted it now all they do is put out
[42:18.240 --> 42:23.040]  one set of documents that's released to the public basically lying about what
[42:23.040 --> 42:27.720]  the program is really for and then they have their internal meetings and
[42:27.720 --> 42:32.720]  executive session about what the program really does so it's it's it's actually
[42:32.720 --> 42:37.760]  just created another layer of lies but but we know why they meet in secret it's
[42:37.760 --> 42:42.200]  because in the breakaway groups from our moles and and our moles have turned out
[42:42.200 --> 42:49.760]  to be very accurate by what they tell us coming true with frightening accuracy
[42:49.760 --> 42:56.480]  that it is the ultra-rich finance ministers representing the big private
[42:56.480 --> 43:00.760]  megabanks meeting with the other government leaders and unifying their
[43:00.760 --> 43:09.520]  agenda against their host country's populations and deciding tit for tat who
[43:09.520 --> 43:14.120]  is going to scratch who's back and and what deals are going to be made and who
[43:14.120 --> 43:18.840]  they're gonna all get behind for prime minister or president and it really is
[43:18.840 --> 43:23.840]  as close as you get to that smoky room it's obviously only one of many
[43:23.840 --> 43:29.080]  conclaves that they have but one of the oldest and most prestigious and it
[43:29.080 --> 43:34.320]  really is a window into mega powerful people colluding together to expand their
[43:34.320 --> 43:40.480]  power yeah to be honest if it's a bunch of private individuals see over airbus
[43:40.480 --> 43:44.680]  and you know the head of fiat if they want to sit around in a smoky room and
[43:44.680 --> 43:51.000]  then plan how to make me drive a driver fiat or buy an airbus you know that's
[43:51.000 --> 43:55.320]  fine you go for it guys but I just don't want my chance to fix checker there
[43:55.320 --> 44:00.000]  for days paid for at my expense in his official capacity as chancellor I don't
[44:00.000 --> 44:03.240]  really want that and then with no accountability no checks and balances
[44:03.240 --> 44:08.040]  and no press you know like what I don't understand I it's it keeps I bought some
[44:08.040 --> 44:11.440]  friends of mine from written this time who are their documentary makers and
[44:11.440 --> 44:14.680]  they couldn't they haven't really been involved in anything like this they came
[44:14.680 --> 44:18.280]  along and you've got the sense that they had a little bit of cognitive
[44:18.280 --> 44:21.520]  dissonance they couldn't quite understand why at an event this big and
[44:21.520 --> 44:24.840]  this significant they looked at the delegate list they saw the cars they saw
[44:24.840 --> 44:28.360]  the police and they went okay I get it I get this is a big important thing I
[44:28.360 --> 44:33.400]  don't quite know where the BBC is I don't understand where Channel 4 news is
[44:33.400 --> 44:38.120]  where's the CNN truck but that's the evidence of the power when you get five
[44:38.120 --> 44:44.800]  European economic ministers together there is literally 500 video cameras and
[44:44.800 --> 44:49.320]  a hundred newspapers there when the Texas governor comes out and gives a
[44:49.320 --> 44:52.600]  speech there's a hundred different media conservatively there when a
[44:52.600 --> 44:57.760]  president comes out there's 500 if they were to let 500 in here you have
[44:57.760 --> 45:02.600]  royalty I mean when Queen Beatrix comes out in the Netherlands there's 300 400
[45:02.600 --> 45:08.160]  media or when she goes to Germany there is here's the the the head of Rothschild
[45:08.160 --> 45:12.240]  Europe here's the rock David Rockefeller here's all these defense ministers
[45:12.240 --> 45:17.080]  here's Robert Gates meeting with the head of NATO the US Defense Secretary
[45:17.080 --> 45:20.600]  meeting with the head of NATO Bill Gates is there the head of Googles there
[45:20.600 --> 45:25.920]  the head of Amazons there and and time and time again we get the documents
[45:25.920 --> 45:30.160]  later oh you know in 1996 the heads of the ten big oil companies met in a
[45:30.160 --> 45:34.520]  secret to shut down refineries to create a bottleneck I mean constantly big
[45:34.520 --> 45:40.040]  business is caught getting together to create cartels to fix prices that's why
[45:40.040 --> 45:44.360]  it is illegal actually and it violates the Logan Act it violates Swiss laws
[45:44.360 --> 45:47.240]  there are British laws against this so the reason they don't want to be
[45:47.240 --> 45:52.360]  photographed going in is because it is illegal what they're doing is criminal
[45:52.360 --> 45:57.200]  and they know the law could be enforced against them Charlie Skelton yeah I
[45:57.200 --> 46:00.280]  mean I'm afraid I don't know my British law particularly well like you know
[46:00.280 --> 46:03.520]  that's I'm gonna forget it's a long job researching Bilderberg because there's so
[46:03.520 --> 46:07.560]  many related aspects and you know I feel like I'm just in the foothills of
[46:07.560 --> 46:12.880]  knowing about it and and learning about its history but yeah I mean it it it
[46:12.880 --> 46:15.640]  just it I've just tied you know I come to the end of this and I'm just sort of
[46:15.640 --> 46:19.840]  slightly tired and embarrassed for them and I just I just it makes me just want
[46:19.840 --> 46:22.480]  to slightly better world with slightly better politicians I mean you don't have
[46:22.480 --> 46:26.560]  to speculate wildly particularly about what they're actually discussing I just
[46:26.560 --> 46:30.880]  don't want to be discussing it in that particular manner you know I just I it's
[46:30.880 --> 46:35.800]  the structure of it that it's the it's a strange white sort of shower curtain they
[46:35.800 --> 46:40.040]  pull around to stop the photographers taking photographs instead ducking down
[46:40.040 --> 46:43.480]  on the backseat of the limo and put a photograph of them holding their you
[46:43.480 --> 46:46.960]  know newspapers to their face again I'm just thinking out for goodness they
[46:46.960 --> 46:51.120]  grow up you know you don't know who you are maybe you're the Greek finance
[46:51.120 --> 46:54.880]  minister or maybe you're the you know the head of the European Central Bank but
[46:54.880 --> 46:59.800]  just give a wave to the cameras you know the wicked flee the wicked flee when
[46:59.800 --> 47:03.840]  none pursue and you bet the wicked flee when we are pursuing them you know the
[47:03.840 --> 47:09.640]  dogs of truth cry have it can turn loose the info warriors but Charlie talking to
[47:09.640 --> 47:13.640]  you off air you were disappointed that there was a somewhat of a blackout in
[47:13.640 --> 47:19.480]  British news we've never had Newsweek Time Magazine AP and dozens of other
[47:19.480 --> 47:26.000]  big big outfits report on it huge European coverage from Greece Germany
[47:26.000 --> 47:31.520]  France Switzerland you name it and I mean you agree with many of the
[47:31.520 --> 47:34.840]  publications that are running the headlines damn breaks on Bilderberg
[47:34.840 --> 47:39.680]  Bilderberg exposed I mean from my research and Tucker agrees and he's the
[47:39.680 --> 47:44.080]  you know this guy that started it all discovered it this is the this is the
[47:44.080 --> 47:48.840]  biggest coverage ever and the biggest opposition to them and reportedly they
[47:48.840 --> 47:52.320]  did leave very early in the morning generally a lot of them stay over till
[47:52.320 --> 47:57.640]  Monday so they it appears that they fled yeah absolutely what one of the
[47:57.640 --> 48:02.240]  things that's changed is that the word because the Bilderberg conferences so
[48:02.240 --> 48:07.160]  adamantly refused to actually relate to the world in any serious normal way like
[48:07.160 --> 48:12.680]  say you know g8 summer talk something like that which basically the you know
[48:12.680 --> 48:15.240]  the citizen journalist the blog is the people that turn up the concerned
[48:15.240 --> 48:18.560]  citizens from all around the world they've sort of had to form themselves
[48:18.560 --> 48:24.600]  into around Bilderberg into the practical setup that should be there so
[48:24.600 --> 48:28.800]  they've actually first the first time this year they've got a proper press
[48:28.800 --> 48:34.360]  center with them with computers in and an internet access and people swapping
[48:34.360 --> 48:38.920]  photos and and you know they've been holding meetings as a group called
[48:38.920 --> 48:41.840]  Bilderberg transparency which is very interesting and they've just been a
[48:41.840 --> 48:45.920]  bunch of young people have been holding seminar discussing why it's important
[48:45.920 --> 48:49.240]  to have transparency you know so you've got seminars you've got sort of breakout
[48:49.240 --> 48:53.040]  meetings people are setting up press releases amongst themselves so what you've
[48:53.040 --> 48:59.520]  got is you've got this kind of amateur yet becoming more sophisticated version
[48:59.520 --> 49:02.600]  of what you would hope to be there anyway you're happening just that's on the
[49:02.600 --> 49:06.920]  ground a new thing is absolutely in the media because there's so much more
[49:06.920 --> 49:10.920]  information coming up from the bottom coming up from you know the journalists
[49:10.920 --> 49:13.640]  whatever you want to call them people people who are going to blog who are
[49:13.640 --> 49:16.920]  going to write to the newspapers who are sending stuff out which is putting
[49:16.920 --> 49:20.320]  information up from the bottom it's gradually forcing its way up into the
[49:20.320 --> 49:25.240]  news agenda and I think that the newspapers the world worldwide are
[49:25.240 --> 49:29.440]  taking note I think that Britain for some reason had a bad year yes last year
[49:29.440 --> 49:32.520]  was really quite good and quite heartening this year not so good and
[49:32.520 --> 49:37.160]  you know I'm going to be going back and talking to the Guardian newspaper and
[49:37.160 --> 49:41.320]  saying well you know the Bilderberg story was the most read story on the
[49:41.320 --> 49:46.400]  whole of your website yesterday yet you didn't quite manage to make it into the
[49:46.400 --> 49:51.200]  newspaper itself the actual printed edition do you think that's a smart
[49:51.200 --> 49:56.000]  decision you know genuinely it makes me a little bit annoyed well at least hold
[49:56.000 --> 49:59.400]  on I mean let's not look a gift towards in the mouth I agree with you it is a
[49:59.400 --> 50:04.240]  problem but at least they were the only big publication in England to cover it
[50:04.240 --> 50:09.200]  Charlie expanding on this though they don't like the process of the real
[50:09.200 --> 50:14.280]  government the real policymakers colluding when when WikiLeaks two weeks ago
[50:14.280 --> 50:19.720]  released classified SPP North American Union documents it's what Judicial
[50:19.720 --> 50:23.840]  Watch had already sued and got part of and it was the Fortune 100 it was about
[50:23.840 --> 50:29.320]  112 or so a little more than the Fortune 100 openly in a four-day conference in
[50:29.320 --> 50:36.360]  Banff giving the government ministers orders and and literally them creating a
[50:36.360 --> 50:41.640]  combine and in a in a sheet and agreeing to implement it so the fact that
[50:41.640 --> 50:45.760]  they are setting policy to a great extent if the public stops looking at
[50:45.760 --> 50:51.080]  Obama the puppet or Merkel the puppet and they start looking really at what
[50:51.080 --> 50:55.400]  are you doing run in my life and getting together to kind of tweak things and
[50:55.400 --> 50:59.640]  iron out disagreements this is criminal you see if we identify Bilderberg it's
[50:59.640 --> 51:03.960]  game over we all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most
[51:03.960 --> 51:08.240]  trusted name in water filtration as an authorized Berkey dealer for over six
[51:08.240 --> 51:12.200]  years and serving thousands of satisfied customers the Berkey guy offers

[54:14.120 --> 54:18.240]  okay Charlie Skelton of the London Guardian biggest paper in England probably
[54:18.240 --> 54:22.240]  the biggest in Europe is our guest five minutes to the next hour them a shift
[54:22.240 --> 54:26.240]  gears into all the other global news and open the phones up in the balance of
[54:26.240 --> 54:32.200]  the transmission today but I was making the point as we went to break that they
[54:32.200 --> 54:36.480]  hide in secret they do this because they're committing crimes the Secretary
[54:36.480 --> 54:40.080]  of Defense did violate the Logan Act and we have laws for a reason Hillary's
[54:40.080 --> 54:45.040]  been fine 300 plus grand for it in the mid 90s look it up for Bilderberg and so
[54:45.040 --> 54:48.600]  if we ever start looking at the true puppet masters instead of the puppets
[54:48.600 --> 54:52.040]  it's game over and that's why they've tried to hide it and you should ask
[54:52.040 --> 54:55.920]  yourself if it doesn't matter then there would be media there would be hundreds
[54:55.920 --> 54:58.720]  of mainstream media wanting to going up saying can we get an interview with the
[54:58.720 --> 55:02.560]  minister since he's here what's being decided here you've got all the big
[55:02.560 --> 55:05.920]  banking heads I mean imagine America if you had the six big banker heads meeting
[55:05.920 --> 55:10.640]  in secret it'd be all over the news well most of them were there just six of them
[55:10.640 --> 55:15.720]  would be big news not 125 and now it's up to 150 because the world's got a lot
[55:15.720 --> 55:19.200]  more people in it now now Charlie Skelton's our guest but but also a
[55:19.200 --> 55:23.960]  little foible I want to cover here a little dis info piece year after year
[55:23.960 --> 55:31.240]  the Bilderberg group releases well the last five years a little bit of their
[55:31.240 --> 55:35.480]  agenda but that was done because they got mad at Tucker in decades past being
[55:35.480 --> 55:39.040]  sent it by the mole that they had you know as their official cover story to
[55:39.040 --> 55:42.800]  members Tucker I've been there when it comes in in the fax machine from his
[55:42.800 --> 55:47.200]  mole and then we get it out and and the same thing happened this year it was
[55:47.200 --> 55:51.520]  leaked to the Swiss media and to others and then Skelton did have it and did
[55:51.520 --> 55:55.000]  give it to us before it was in the news then Bilderberg doesn't like to be
[55:55.000 --> 55:59.160]  passé so they then release it so basically we're forcing it they didn't
[55:59.160 --> 56:02.640]  have a website till what five years ago and then people send me emails going you
[56:02.640 --> 56:06.520]  did this isn't exclusive this isn't no we said thank the Swiss media no it was
[56:06.520 --> 56:10.200]  leaked and then we forced them to release it so it's not oh here's a public
[56:10.200 --> 56:13.640]  document we're saying oh look we have the list the point is it's a process of
[56:13.640 --> 56:17.440]  forcing them to admit they have the list Charlie Skelton we have the list we
[56:17.440 --> 56:21.880]  have also the agenda talk about that then we'll come back and talk about the
[56:21.880 --> 56:25.440]  nature walk and them getting caught with their pants down
[56:25.440 --> 56:29.920]  it really means very much I mean that the agenda list we can't say that the
[56:29.920 --> 56:32.920]  they only published the website last year halfway through the Bilderberg
[56:32.920 --> 56:36.680]  meeting in Spain when they were under so much pressure of the press that they
[56:36.680 --> 56:40.000]  suddenly went we're just gonna have to do something and likewise this year they
[56:40.000 --> 56:43.520]  only published the thing now if you I may be wrong but I'm pretty sure they only
[56:43.520 --> 56:48.320]  published their list of delegates and the agenda after the delegate list got
[56:48.320 --> 56:53.600]  leaked to a Spanish Spanish Swiss website so they tend to just kind of
[56:53.600 --> 56:56.520]  respond when you brought them a little but you know the delegate list is
[56:56.520 --> 57:01.640]  always incomplete last year you know we found out I found out one that the
[57:01.640 --> 57:05.320]  president of Madrid was present but not on the list you know it's like that's one
[57:05.320 --> 57:09.760]  example of many many examples so you know they give you an incomplete list they
[57:09.760 --> 57:13.160]  give you a list of the agenda topics people are people say oh look they
[57:13.160 --> 57:15.920]  published their agenda they're transparent you look at the agenda they
[57:15.920 --> 57:20.360]  publish on there on there on the way to absolutely laugh a little bit one of the
[57:20.360 --> 57:24.760]  agenda topics is China what I mean to point back that's information on what
[57:24.760 --> 57:28.680]  they're discussing the words China I mean it's pathetic it's laughable it's
[57:28.680 --> 57:35.520]  reasonable you call your GRACE's saying where we're oh on the agenda China the
[57:35.520 --> 57:41.260]  China or or banking or or Middle East Wars that tells you nothing it's like
[57:41.260 --> 57:43.980]  saying we're discussing politics
[57:43.980 --> 57:47.540]  No, no, I'm literally writing the words for my next speech which is I might as well have a list which says
[57:47.540 --> 57:51.980]  topics, things we discussed, important stuff, other things you know I mean
[57:51.980 --> 57:54.860]  literally that is about as much information as you can get from their agenda
[57:54.860 --> 57:58.260]  I mean what about one of the German ministers will come back and talk about
[57:58.260 --> 58:01.500]  that but but on the nature walk they say we want to know what your secret agenda
[58:01.500 --> 58:05.980]  is and he says it is our agenda and it's none of your business
[58:05.980 --> 58:09.980]  yeah we're making agendas which I think I'm you know brought they say on the
[58:09.980 --> 58:14.220]  website they don't make policy but I mean you know believe that you believe in anything
[58:14.220 --> 58:17.660]  and policy is an agenda let's break down exactly what they said we have that
[58:17.660 --> 58:21.180]  video that you linked to that the great activist scott's info wars dot com

[1:00:38.460 --> 1:00:42.740]  Charlie Skelton the London Guardian getting into their quote public agenda I
[1:00:42.740 --> 1:00:46.300]  now have not just the first stuff we got but the full agenda from Tucker's
[1:00:46.300 --> 1:00:49.740]  Mole and I just remembered I've been so exhausted I need to get that to Curt
[1:00:49.740 --> 1:00:54.420]  Nemo and get that out the first part of the agenda was linked on Wednesday at
[1:00:54.420 --> 1:00:59.620]  Drudge for two days but headline a Bilderberg agenda leaked by mole now
[1:00:59.620 --> 1:01:04.860]  we've got the full agenda so I need to get on that so much news it's like water
[1:01:04.860 --> 1:01:07.860]  water everywhere not a drop to drink this because I don't even have time to get
[1:01:07.860 --> 1:01:10.900]  down and drink it Charlie you got the floor in the last four minutes what you
[1:01:10.900 --> 1:01:14.740]  think of the nature walk other things on the quote agenda other little things you
[1:01:14.740 --> 1:01:19.940]  notice Bilderberg 2011 well the nature walk was quite a bizarre I really was
[1:01:19.940 --> 1:01:24.540]  yeah they all but not they all they did a bit of buses up up the hill and then
[1:01:24.540 --> 1:01:30.780]  walk back down and walk down a group of them sort of splintered off and then
[1:01:30.780 --> 1:01:34.820]  walked straight into smack into about 60 activists and journalists who were just
[1:01:34.820 --> 1:01:37.740]  sort of just sitting about they looked up and they went oh my goodness there was a
[1:01:37.740 --> 1:01:43.820]  woman in a Princess Leah outfit the white-way lady in white yeah yeah that
[1:01:43.820 --> 1:01:47.620]  was very strange it was quite a bit surreal for a little bit and then they
[1:01:47.620 --> 1:01:52.140]  sort of the activists warmed around and and Thomas Enders the CEO of Airbus gave
[1:01:52.140 --> 1:01:56.420]  a kind of impromptu interview in which he said yeah yeah we're just
[1:01:56.420 --> 1:02:02.740]  doing our agendas and I asked the guy asked the German guy who interviewed him
[1:02:02.740 --> 1:02:05.820]  in German I said well what do you mean agenda what's the way he said it's the
[1:02:05.820 --> 1:02:09.500]  verdict agenda it did agendas the same word and then what and that was my German
[1:02:09.500 --> 1:02:13.180]  accent my Swiss accent oh I don't know whatever but he said agenda so they're
[1:02:13.180 --> 1:02:22.300]  talking about their agenda yeah German is the root of English you know what you
[1:02:22.300 --> 1:02:28.620]  don't need to know that and so yeah it was it was an interesting little episode
[1:02:28.620 --> 1:02:31.180]  in in Bilderberg's history I don't honestly think they're gonna go on many
[1:02:31.180 --> 1:02:34.500]  more nature walks it wasn't that success it was fun hearing all those German
[1:02:34.500 --> 1:02:39.340]  Germanic voices screaming at the Bilderberg's they did not like it in fact
[1:02:39.340 --> 1:02:43.780]  one of them which British minister was it was a Mandelson was like this is
[1:02:43.780 --> 1:02:50.540]  terrible oh lord I worry when I see him there because the last time he was there
[1:02:50.540 --> 1:02:53.860]  was the they they rushed through the digital economy building if you look at
[1:02:53.860 --> 1:02:57.020]  the agenda you look at the people there there's a lot of internet security stuff
[1:02:57.020 --> 1:03:03.420]  going on so yeah so we could write you a nice free internet everyone yeah they're
[1:03:03.420 --> 1:03:07.940]  making big moves publicly to quote you know shut down freedom on the web and
[1:03:07.940 --> 1:03:12.300]  create internet to that's only accessible by the giants so you've got to be on the
[1:03:12.300 --> 1:03:17.260]  giant you know systems the clouds but where the cloud folks the evil cloud
[1:03:17.260 --> 1:03:22.460]  this cloud stuff is very dangerous it's very interesting philosophically it's
[1:03:22.460 --> 1:03:25.820]  pretty it's just it's abstracting everyone's knowledge and everyone's data
[1:03:25.820 --> 1:03:29.820]  and everyone's kind of being and putting it in a in a in a sort of place
[1:03:29.820 --> 1:03:34.100]  that these people think oh that's out there that's there forever it's like
[1:03:34.100 --> 1:03:37.660]  digital photos when the last time you printed one out you know the stuff is it
[1:03:37.660 --> 1:03:41.420]  just takes all of all of pretty much everything and makes it intangible and
[1:03:41.420 --> 1:03:44.860]  deleteable you know it's how you know it's the type I feel that ends up with
[1:03:44.860 --> 1:03:47.260]  someone being switched off they click the button and then what what was it
[1:03:47.260 --> 1:03:50.940]  where's my data where's my where am I oh you're on the cloud or used to be until
[1:03:50.940 --> 1:03:55.300]  we turn you off like Tron where they just delete you yeah I mean I know that
[1:03:55.300 --> 1:03:58.460]  sounds ridiculous but that's the direction we're heading and you know we
[1:03:58.460 --> 1:04:01.340]  have to sort of vaguely kind of sniff out the direction various things are
[1:04:01.340 --> 1:04:04.460]  taking and you know the direction of Bilderberg is away from transparency
[1:04:04.460 --> 1:04:08.060]  and towards the things I don't necessarily think it's good for the work
[1:04:08.060 --> 1:04:10.740]  you know I don't necessarily want to talk about what they're talking about so
[1:04:10.740 --> 1:04:14.700]  much is the fact that the way it's done is it's just abhorrent absolutely
[1:04:14.700 --> 1:04:19.160]  Charlie Skelton you've done an exemplary job you are truly a great
[1:04:19.160 --> 1:04:23.860]  Bilderberg sleuth and you've brought the greatest amount of attention next to

[1:05:03.620 --> 1:05:07.980]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[1:05:07.980 --> 1:05:12.140]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[1:05:12.140 --> 1:05:16.180]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[1:05:16.180 --> 1:05:20.100]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[1:05:20.100 --> 1:05:24.220]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[1:05:24.220 --> 1:05:28.540]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[1:05:28.540 --> 1:05:32.820]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[1:05:32.820 --> 1:05:36.540]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number

[1:08:01.780 --> 1:08:09.100]  the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[1:08:11.500 --> 1:08:20.460]  it's really very simple at the first level and that is the fact that if you
[1:08:20.460 --> 1:08:25.180]  read the writings of British royalty of the Royal Society in England of the
[1:08:25.180 --> 1:08:33.340]  different princetums and fiefdoms in germanium the Austrian Hungarian Empire
[1:08:33.340 --> 1:08:40.100]  they openly obsessed on how do elites continue their power and never get
[1:08:40.100 --> 1:08:44.220]  thrown out of power because they're aware that other corrupt establishments
[1:08:44.220 --> 1:08:49.220]  do get thrown out of power they said we will set up a scientific dictatorship
[1:08:49.220 --> 1:08:53.620]  that term was coined over a hundred and fifty years ago and they said it's a
[1:08:53.620 --> 1:08:59.740]  dictatorship of the elite for the elite by the elite and it's there it's in all
[1:08:59.740 --> 1:09:04.220]  their writings it's what they've set up it's a global standardized society that's
[1:09:04.220 --> 1:09:07.900]  why the same systems go in in Australia that go in in the US same thing in
[1:09:07.900 --> 1:09:15.940]  Germany the same unified system and they're doing it to track and trace you
[1:09:15.940 --> 1:09:19.300]  not just spy on you to see where you're going or what you're doing because they
[1:09:19.300 --> 1:09:23.140]  think you're going to try something or do something bad no it's to understand
[1:09:23.140 --> 1:09:28.780]  you it's to know you they use the television and the dumb down media and
[1:09:28.780 --> 1:09:33.220]  the culture to keep you totally unconscious never thinking about who you
[1:09:33.220 --> 1:09:37.860]  are and what you are and what it is to be human and what do you stand for they
[1:09:37.860 --> 1:09:42.260]  tell you don't stand for anything be a moron while they're obsessed with what
[1:09:42.260 --> 1:09:46.820]  you're doing and who you are and what you want and what your desires are they're
[1:09:46.820 --> 1:09:52.300]  like a magician endlessly studying new magic tricks to manipulate you I'm gonna
[1:09:52.300 --> 1:09:54.740]  tell you a story right now then I'm gonna give the phone number out fact I'll
[1:09:54.740 --> 1:09:59.420]  give the phone number out right now and then we'll go to your calls coming up
[1:09:59.420 --> 1:10:04.340]  the next segment but couple nights a week we'll let my children watch
[1:10:04.340 --> 1:10:09.140]  television and we've got the whole on-demand system and one into the house
[1:10:09.140 --> 1:10:12.700]  that we know full wells internet two-way tracking everything we're watching
[1:10:12.700 --> 1:10:16.020]  everything we're doing we tell the children this is a computerized system
[1:10:16.020 --> 1:10:21.820]  wired into major globalist corporations it's like when I when daddy puts out
[1:10:21.820 --> 1:10:27.260]  corn to make the deer come so I can shoot them and butcher them I'm literally
[1:10:27.260 --> 1:10:31.740]  man and they understand yes we understand as I only let them watch
[1:10:31.740 --> 1:10:38.420]  scientific information predominantly and I explained to them you know how we go
[1:10:38.420 --> 1:10:43.700]  to east Texas on our ranch and we have deer feeders well it's the same thing
[1:10:43.700 --> 1:10:47.420]  they get the people on welfare to control them so they can be used as an
[1:10:47.420 --> 1:10:53.140]  army politically against the middle class do you understand that yes my son
[1:10:53.140 --> 1:10:56.500]  and eight years old they're hired like mercenaries but they don't know their
[1:10:56.500 --> 1:11:00.780]  mercenaries good soon you will be much more intelligent and understanding than
[1:11:00.780 --> 1:11:04.980]  I am to watch him grow he's gonna be a great weapon against the globalist and
[1:11:04.980 --> 1:11:08.760]  then of course the seven-year-old daughter and the three-year-old all all
[1:11:08.760 --> 1:11:11.900]  beginning to understand how the universe works if you treat children like adults
[1:11:11.900 --> 1:11:18.420]  what happens with them is amazing you're meant to mature by 12 13 meant to go to
[1:11:18.420 --> 1:11:23.380]  sea by the time you're 10 meant to be in war by the time you're 12 meant to have
[1:11:23.380 --> 1:11:28.980]  a family already well-going by 16 or 17 but they stunt development they stunt
[1:11:28.980 --> 1:11:33.900]  growth but but I know the point is I go this is a two-way system just like the
[1:11:33.900 --> 1:11:38.180]  laptop why do we have stickers over the camera because they watch us I was
[1:11:38.180 --> 1:11:40.860]  telling him that before it was admitted on the news because I knew I had the
[1:11:40.860 --> 1:11:44.900]  blueprints and not that I'm paranoid I'm teaching them to be empowered we're not
[1:11:44.900 --> 1:11:51.300]  scared they're watching us because they're scared that's right and my son
[1:11:51.300 --> 1:11:54.500]  starts telling me about the Roman emperors and Machiavelli he's the one
[1:11:54.500 --> 1:11:58.540]  that literally reads adult books constantly it's scary how smart he is
[1:11:58.540 --> 1:12:05.980]  and a new and improved model I'm sorry I'm sorry I shouldn't even talk about
[1:12:05.980 --> 1:12:17.980]  him okay okay sorry I'll have a little a little enjoyment off of knowledge there
[1:12:17.980 --> 1:12:22.740]  I love knowledge I'm addicted to it and problems people think I'm good at
[1:12:22.740 --> 1:12:24.980]  delivering knowledge it's the opposite I just have a lot of knowledge I'm not
[1:12:24.980 --> 1:12:28.100]  good at delivering it because there's too much in the way I see the knowledge in
[1:12:28.100 --> 1:12:32.020]  a three-dimensional hologram integrated system but all of you see it that way as
[1:12:32.020 --> 1:12:35.700]  well you must tap into it you must use it it will grow exponentially the human
[1:12:35.700 --> 1:12:44.860]  computer is incredible now we're looking at science programs on you verse or
[1:12:44.860 --> 1:12:50.380]  whatever it is and and because I don't really watch it and they say okay you can
[1:12:50.380 --> 1:12:55.300]  watch a nova or you can watch a front line and remember this will still have
[1:12:55.300 --> 1:12:59.580]  propaganda in it and when they do the average anti-human carbon tax guilt
[1:12:59.580 --> 1:13:03.540]  business to create a guilt complex so they can then order the kids around when
[1:13:03.540 --> 1:13:07.660]  they're adults by triggering the guilt words we go up what's that that's a
[1:13:07.660 --> 1:13:11.420]  that's a guilt word to make me guilty you have to analyze that remember what
[1:13:11.420 --> 1:13:16.740]  are the true environmental threats genetic engineering fish infusion quantum
[1:13:16.740 --> 1:13:20.900]  reactors that's right are we against those no but they could be dangerous and
[1:13:20.900 --> 1:13:25.900]  we and we need more you know more review of that but how do we do that by
[1:13:25.900 --> 1:13:28.300]  transparency how do we do that we educate people we talk about it that's
[1:13:28.300 --> 1:13:33.100]  right that's why we don't watch a lot of TV because then I got to sit there while
[1:13:33.100 --> 1:13:36.540]  they're watching it and make sure they understand what's happening but I'm
[1:13:36.540 --> 1:13:40.540]  sitting there and they're looking at selections and they go we want to watch
[1:13:40.540 --> 1:13:45.900]  this episode of the brain or the mind I forget what it was on Nova I know it's
[1:13:45.900 --> 1:13:50.580]  a black guy that's a presenter an amiable a good presenter I like him only
[1:13:50.580 --> 1:13:53.180]  to wash him a few times but if you want to know it's the minor the brain I
[1:13:53.180 --> 1:13:56.180]  wasn't really paying attention the point is it's a black guy that has something
[1:13:56.180 --> 1:13:58.860]  on Nova called the mind of the brain I think it's the human mind it was one of
[1:13:58.860 --> 1:14:04.260]  the episodes and they start saying why can humankind think about the cosmos
[1:14:04.260 --> 1:14:09.140]  and philosophy of mathematics and incredible literature but be fooled by a
[1:14:09.140 --> 1:14:15.700]  simple trick of a magician and before they went there before I never seen this
[1:14:15.700 --> 1:14:20.220]  show I said hit pause I'm gonna show you something children and my wife's like
[1:14:20.220 --> 1:14:24.620]  no just let him watch it I go okay okay but this is what's gonna come they're
[1:14:24.620 --> 1:14:29.540]  gonna explain that it's a slide of hand because in primitive societies things
[1:14:29.540 --> 1:14:35.780]  move so fast and humans are are only designed to see the world in a
[1:14:35.780 --> 1:14:42.060]  truthful way not through deception and if a tiger is about to jump on you or an
[1:14:42.060 --> 1:14:46.820]  enemy's coming over the hill and somebody basically you know pulls their
[1:14:46.820 --> 1:14:50.420]  knife on you and tries to stab you you've got to make a split second
[1:14:50.420 --> 1:14:53.820]  decision and so that's why if you throw your fist at somebody they
[1:14:53.820 --> 1:14:57.620]  automatically feel like the fist has hit them and that's why they'll move out of
[1:14:57.620 --> 1:15:02.060]  the way because they're going for your instincts they're going at your reflexes
[1:15:02.060 --> 1:15:06.060]  and that's the main thing a magician does even though you think that they
[1:15:06.060 --> 1:15:09.460]  reach in your pocket and got the coin or you think you saw them flip the coin
[1:15:09.460 --> 1:15:13.420]  and then saw it appear across the room in a goblet it didn't really do it
[1:15:13.420 --> 1:15:20.340]  because your brain has blind spots through its development my wife's kind of
[1:15:20.340 --> 1:15:27.100]  rolling her eyes she's sweet but she's just tired up and sure enough sure
[1:15:27.100 --> 1:15:31.860]  enough everything I said was then said by the television program but they said
[1:15:31.860 --> 1:15:34.980]  it different they said a saber-tooth cat comes after you got to move quick
[1:15:34.980 --> 1:15:39.180]  somebody throws a spear at you you're gonna duck because if you didn't duck the
[1:15:39.180 --> 1:15:42.580]  spear is gonna get you so even if they don't throw the spear your brain feels
[1:15:42.580 --> 1:15:47.060]  like they've thrown the spear and something I had about a year ago two
[1:15:47.060 --> 1:15:51.780]  years ago and lost I meant to go over on air I think I did was Darrell Rundus is
[1:15:51.780 --> 1:15:56.860]  a salesman and he's a donator to our operation great guy and he likes to come
[1:15:56.860 --> 1:16:00.220]  down to visit sometimes and he brought me examples of how he breaks people out
[1:16:00.220 --> 1:16:04.460]  of their trances and he says here's this card read this card and the card
[1:16:04.460 --> 1:16:09.700]  talks about something innocuous but it's missing words but you fill in the
[1:16:09.700 --> 1:16:13.900]  word and as you're reading it without even knowing you will fill in the word
[1:16:13.900 --> 1:16:19.500]  that isn't there I wasn't even aware of that I don't study this stuff much I
[1:16:19.500 --> 1:16:23.700]  just organically see it right there in front of me for what it is and I
[1:16:23.700 --> 1:16:31.980]  immediately saw that I mean I immediately see things in TV shows I
[1:16:31.980 --> 1:16:36.620]  immediately see it when it's propaganda in print but I still didn't see it and
[1:16:36.620 --> 1:16:41.260]  didn't immediately see it on the cards and I need to get a hold of some more
[1:16:41.260 --> 1:16:45.140]  of those and you know do a special video about that because it's the tricks
[1:16:45.140 --> 1:16:48.500]  there's sociologists their anthropologists their psychiatrists
[1:16:48.500 --> 1:16:52.980]  their pitchmen they're constantly studying and still spending it's got to
[1:16:52.980 --> 1:16:57.620]  be trillions of dollars in the last 150 years in the aggregate studying how we
[1:16:57.620 --> 1:17:03.740]  work and they're playing God and they're engaging in all these tricks now the
[1:17:03.740 --> 1:17:09.260]  good news is for somebody that's awake their tricks look ridiculous they look
[1:17:09.260 --> 1:17:12.860]  stupid and you look to the public and you say why don't you see that trick why
[1:17:12.860 --> 1:17:17.900]  didn't you just see what happened there and they look at you like you're crazy
[1:17:17.900 --> 1:17:24.700]  that's why 3,000 years ago they would call a magician a magician we call a
[1:17:24.700 --> 1:17:30.860]  magician a magician today but we know a magician is a trickster a magician is
[1:17:30.860 --> 1:17:34.460]  doing sleight of hand we may not know how he's doing the trick but we know
[1:17:34.460 --> 1:17:40.140]  it's a trick people thousands of years ago in China in Rome anywhere you went
[1:17:40.140 --> 1:17:44.180]  they thought magicians really were magic they thought when they threw some
[1:17:44.180 --> 1:17:48.700]  dirt in the fire and exploded in blue flame or green flame that that was a
[1:17:48.700 --> 1:17:52.700]  spirit coming out the magician knew that if you mix these chemicals together he
[1:17:52.700 --> 1:17:57.860]  would get gunpowder and if he put certain other metals into it it would
[1:17:57.860 --> 1:18:01.780]  have a certain color he would say red dragon throw it in boom a red fire
[1:18:01.780 --> 1:18:06.660]  because he knew to add a certain metal to it copper copper burn screen but the
[1:18:06.660 --> 1:18:10.100]  point is different metals have different fires green dragon throw it in boom
[1:18:10.100 --> 1:18:15.980]  green dragon mmm blue dragon boom they thought that was a real dragon spirit
[1:18:15.980 --> 1:18:20.300]  coming out now today we still call him magicians a dark man the Bible talks
[1:18:20.300 --> 1:18:26.860]  about magicians they're just con artist but today we go see a magician and we
[1:18:26.860 --> 1:18:31.780]  know it's a con but we go knowing it's a con because it's interesting because it
[1:18:31.780 --> 1:18:36.700]  fools our brain but intellectually we know it's fake now let me give you
[1:18:36.700 --> 1:18:39.780]  another example of a modern magician there's trillions of examples literally
[1:18:39.780 --> 1:18:45.820]  as because there's Google you know unlimited trillion zeros there's a
[1:18:45.820 --> 1:18:52.660]  Google multiplex Google plex squared by the power of treks of Gillian past
[1:18:52.660 --> 1:18:57.300]  infinity in a multi-layered 12-dimensional over driving paradigm that
[1:18:57.300 --> 1:19:04.860]  loops in upon itself now here's an example he looks for when I say this
[1:19:04.860 --> 1:19:12.660]  magic trick right now it's called lying a lie is a trick that's why you say in
[1:19:12.660 --> 1:19:16.820]  the old days in business no tricks no tricks there's any tricks I'm gonna take
[1:19:16.820 --> 1:19:20.500]  you out back that's what people in the old days there wasn't as much crime or
[1:19:20.500 --> 1:19:23.580]  as much con artistry because the people actually caught you in a trick well
[1:19:23.580 --> 1:19:27.100]  unless you were the high priest only that group would get away with it but
[1:19:27.100 --> 1:19:35.900]  here's a trick toll free number to join us 1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9331
[1:19:35.900 --> 1:19:39.380]  it's up on the air when we come back but I'm gonna finish up with the trick
[1:19:39.380 --> 1:19:43.540]  take some calls and get into all the news and when you hear this trick you're
[1:19:43.540 --> 1:19:54.900]  gonna say that's no trick at all but to people in 1951 99% of them believed it
[1:19:54.900 --> 1:20:02.140]  so see we got to get ahead of these tricks the right back stay with us GCN

[1:24:18.620 --> 1:24:27.100]  tricks and magic is just a lie I mean there's all sorts of lies seems like
[1:24:27.100 --> 1:24:31.580]  every child I've had at about age five they learn the joke somewhere I guess
[1:24:31.580 --> 1:24:35.540]  when they're hanging out with their friends in the neighborhood to say here
[1:24:35.540 --> 1:24:40.740]  daddy sit down you know we made you something and it's some strawberries on
[1:24:40.740 --> 1:24:44.580]  a tray and I come to sit down I trust my children and when I go to sit down they
[1:24:44.580 --> 1:24:48.820]  pull the chair out from under me and my tailbone bounces off the ground I look
[1:24:48.820 --> 1:24:52.460]  at them and I go I know somebody taught you that's funny but I could have broken
[1:24:52.460 --> 1:24:57.060]  a bone and then and I could have died in surgery I almost died when I had a
[1:24:57.060 --> 1:25:00.020]  compound fracture when they did surgery because they had to give me nine times
[1:25:00.020 --> 1:25:04.660]  the anesthesia to put me under now do you want me to die and I'm there like
[1:25:04.660 --> 1:25:08.020]  no and I'm like practical jokes can be dangerous they'll never do it again I
[1:25:08.020 --> 1:25:11.260]  don't have to get them spanking knowledge is the key to everything but
[1:25:11.260 --> 1:25:16.900]  that's a lie oh here here daddy sit down we'll pull your chair out you go to
[1:25:16.900 --> 1:25:20.140]  sit down as they see a sit down they pull the chair out everybody's child's
[1:25:20.140 --> 1:25:24.260]  done that that I've talked to now that's not the big lie 19 early 1950s you can
[1:25:24.260 --> 1:25:27.940]  pull up the hearings even seen clips of it on TV always mean to dig that out
[1:25:27.940 --> 1:25:33.220]  somewhere testifying on organized crime before Congress is the head of the FBI
[1:25:33.220 --> 1:25:39.060]  and the head of the FBI Jagger Hoover this is on record it's up and says there
[1:25:39.060 --> 1:25:45.960]  is no such thing as La Cosa Nostra and organized crime it does not exist the
[1:25:45.960 --> 1:25:51.020]  congressman most of them on the take of course are giggling but this is start
[1:25:51.020 --> 1:25:53.940]  to birth this is started to break people were mad they were tired of being
[1:25:53.940 --> 1:26:02.540]  shaken down by the Italian and the wasp and the Jewish and the Irish mob they
[1:26:02.540 --> 1:26:07.020]  were tired of it and the police and every major city were on the take we've
[1:26:07.020 --> 1:26:11.060]  been corrupt a long time I mean they had to fire multiple times in New York 70
[1:26:11.060 --> 1:26:14.460]  plus percent of the narcotics squad they don't do it anymore they finally got the
[1:26:14.460 --> 1:26:17.940]  whole thing corrupt almost you know every person or they keep their mouth
[1:26:17.940 --> 1:26:21.300]  shut if they're not fully involved and it you're not gonna ever hear about that
[1:26:21.300 --> 1:26:27.220]  again because it's it's business it's big business but but but see that's a
[1:26:27.220 --> 1:26:31.140]  magic trick and the magic trick was he didn't need a black hat and a fancy
[1:26:31.140 --> 1:26:36.260]  suit to divert you and a beautiful assistant in garter belts he didn't need
[1:26:36.260 --> 1:26:39.700]  a rabbit in the hat he didn't need any of the mechanical devices he didn't need
[1:26:39.700 --> 1:26:45.580]  any of his props he was the head of the FBI he was the high priest of guarding
[1:26:45.580 --> 1:26:48.900]  America he's the guy fighting the dirty communists while the Pentagon funded the
[1:26:48.900 --> 1:26:56.340]  whole thing now declassified KGB records released he is a man we can trust he
[1:26:56.340 --> 1:27:06.060]  is his G men they are the truest blue Americana the whole way they just are
[1:27:06.060 --> 1:27:12.460]  the best people you can imagine really turns out the government hired a gay
[1:27:12.460 --> 1:27:15.820]  man not that he was a bad person at first but because he could be
[1:27:15.820 --> 1:27:19.660]  compromised and they told him that's who you hire around you so we can burn
[1:27:19.660 --> 1:27:23.140]  anybody we want whenever we want and you're gonna have your gay palace the
[1:27:23.140 --> 1:27:28.700]  FBI the lower level guys who aren't in on that club they'll be you know they'll
[1:27:28.700 --> 1:27:32.980]  investigate low-level bank robberies and cats and trees but you got your little
[1:27:32.980 --> 1:27:37.420]  gay cult now Jagger Hoover but you don't you tell people there's no such thing
[1:27:37.420 --> 1:27:43.060]  as La Cosa Nostra because we got these photos of you you like to dress up like
[1:27:43.060 --> 1:27:48.300]  Marie Antoinette you got that Mac and you get the payments you're gonna get
[1:27:48.300 --> 1:27:52.500]  the cash you're gonna get everything you want but you keep your mouth shut a you
[1:27:52.500 --> 1:27:58.420]  and your Nancy boys are gonna be in the news and so you wonder why this
[1:27:58.420 --> 1:28:02.180]  recruiting why so many congressmen get caught why why it seems like the norm
[1:28:02.180 --> 1:28:07.540]  it's not that it's because you've got to be compromisable you've got to be they've
[1:28:07.540 --> 1:28:10.740]  got to be able to hit one button that isn't connected all their other crime
[1:28:10.740 --> 1:28:16.420]  syndicates and go up you're burnt oh you're the governor in New York you're
[1:28:16.420 --> 1:28:21.780]  visiting $3,000 an hour hookers you're gonna pass a law or we're gonna release
[1:28:21.780 --> 1:28:26.260]  the information that if anybody gets caught visiting a hooker we take their
[1:28:26.260 --> 1:28:29.700]  car maybe even their house okay I'll do it people said he's a hypocrite of course
[1:28:29.700 --> 1:28:32.820]  he's a hypocrite they were blackmailing him the whole time then he thought he'd
[1:28:32.820 --> 1:28:37.460]  shoot his mouth off about banks to get some brownie points and they said he's
[1:28:37.460 --> 1:28:43.820]  getting a little uppity burning our girls got it all on him oh you think
[1:28:43.820 --> 1:28:47.020]  those hookers you're visiting with aren't recording the whole thing and
[1:28:47.020 --> 1:28:50.580]  aren't working for the government and if the hookers get out of line they hang
[1:28:50.580 --> 1:28:56.060]  themselves in mommy's tool shed see that's how they control the whole
[1:28:56.060 --> 1:29:01.420]  government so so today you laugh and you go magic trick yeah it's a magic trick
[1:29:01.420 --> 1:29:04.780]  to have him up there in a suit go there's no such thing as La Cosa Nostra

[1:32:02.420 --> 1:32:06.860]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[1:32:06.860 --> 1:32:10.860]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[1:32:10.860 --> 1:32:14.780]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[1:32:14.780 --> 1:32:18.780]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[1:32:18.780 --> 1:32:23.340]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[1:32:23.340 --> 1:32:27.380]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[1:32:27.380 --> 1:32:31.180]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[1:32:31.180 --> 1:32:34.780]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[1:32:34.780 --> 1:32:39.140]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[1:32:39.140 --> 1:32:42.260]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[1:32:42.260 --> 1:32:45.940]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you
[1:32:45.940 --> 1:32:51.500]  can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com
[1:32:51.500 --> 1:32:56.260]  remember the government doesn't own the Sun so go to mysolarbackup.com or call

[1:33:13.060 --> 1:33:19.740]  so one of the more sophisticated magic tricks that the globalists have engaged
[1:33:19.740 --> 1:33:25.260]  in is to get people to love their servitude to buy into the lies and
[1:33:25.260 --> 1:33:31.380]  defend the lies because if you wake up to the lies and stop trusting the system
[1:33:31.380 --> 1:33:36.580]  then it's game over for this ruling class so they're constantly beta testing
[1:33:36.580 --> 1:33:42.860]  new lies new ways to distract you but still one of the best is the magic trick
[1:33:42.860 --> 1:33:47.500]  of blowing up a federal building or blowing up some big towers and then
[1:33:47.500 --> 1:33:51.740]  saying some foreigners did it see have a pretext to launch new wars and take the
[1:33:51.740 --> 1:33:56.460]  liberties away from your slaves domestically because they're starting
[1:33:56.460 --> 1:34:00.340]  to wake up right when a whole bunch of states were about to implement 10th
[1:34:00.340 --> 1:34:04.460]  amendment moves to kick the UN out of the US and to get our sovereignty back
[1:34:04.460 --> 1:34:08.940]  the feds blew up a federal building picked one of the bunch of kids in it and
[1:34:08.940 --> 1:34:13.420]  you go back and look at all the evidence of that it is an absolute fact that
[1:34:13.420 --> 1:34:17.940]  that's what happened and look I got to tell you the magic trick here I mean I
[1:34:17.940 --> 1:34:22.020]  can't just go along with because a lot of hosts out there I talked to them
[1:34:22.020 --> 1:34:25.620]  behind the scenes they know the truth but they're scared well you know what
[1:34:25.620 --> 1:34:30.420]  you better be scared of a society that allows criminals like this to pull off
[1:34:30.420 --> 1:34:34.260]  things like this now does that mean we don't have enemies overseas does that
[1:34:34.260 --> 1:34:39.700]  mean there aren't some real terrorists no there are but the question is are these
[1:34:39.700 --> 1:34:45.220]  threats the manufactured the real the provocateur it's a whole grab bag of
[1:34:45.220 --> 1:34:49.540]  different things is it worth giving up all of our liberties and freedoms will
[1:34:49.540 --> 1:34:54.980]  this police state be abused against us the answer is yes it has because it was
[1:34:54.980 --> 1:35:00.500]  designed to be abused it's not being abused it was designed you were told
[1:35:00.500 --> 1:35:06.260]  it was for something else but it was really for tyranny and wherever there
[1:35:06.260 --> 1:35:11.180]  is secrecy you need to look wherever something can be hidden
[1:35:11.180 --> 1:35:17.020]  electromagnetic waves they knew three decades ago as they authorized the cell
[1:35:17.020 --> 1:35:21.260]  phones that they'd kill you dead in a hammer they did it now it's ubiquitous
[1:35:21.260 --> 1:35:25.340]  everybody's using it now they tell you nobody's taking them out people have
[1:35:25.340 --> 1:35:30.780]  habitualized it as a habit we're dead just like smoking boom and even the UN
[1:35:30.780 --> 1:35:34.660]  has to admit it's as bad as smoking not gonna stop nobody is everybody's dead
[1:35:34.660 --> 1:35:38.780]  okay because they know we're creatures a habit we've not taken these tools we're
[1:35:38.780 --> 1:35:43.140]  tool makers we're tool users we love them we see the tools as us now the
[1:35:43.140 --> 1:35:47.460]  wireless goes in everywhere we're all just frying our wombs frying our genitals
[1:35:47.460 --> 1:35:52.860]  frying our children frying our DNA not gonna stop unless we have a total
[1:35:52.860 --> 1:35:59.780]  awakening that's why I'm thrown at your face the water it's invisible the sodium
[1:35:59.780 --> 1:36:05.260]  fluoride the other chemicals you can really boil it down and see the see the
[1:36:05.260 --> 1:36:11.500]  contaminant built up on the bottom of the pan but it's nearly invisible and you
[1:36:11.500 --> 1:36:14.140]  just get used to that chemical taste and think that's what good water tastes
[1:36:14.140 --> 1:36:19.020]  like hundreds of deadly chemicals radioactive isotopes poisonous fluoride
[1:36:19.020 --> 1:36:22.740]  mercury lead arsenic and you you complain the news comes out and says
[1:36:22.740 --> 1:36:26.740]  mercury's good for you now we said so magic trick throw it in your face that's
[1:36:26.740 --> 1:36:29.860]  another magic trick just now they know that the jigs up so they just lie
[1:36:29.860 --> 1:36:33.700]  openly about everything and make it more and more bizarre so we just kind of
[1:36:33.700 --> 1:36:37.140]  roll over and learn helplessness they're just hitting us from every angle
[1:36:37.140 --> 1:36:42.780]  piling it on but only being aware of the fact that it is a magic trick to make
[1:36:42.780 --> 1:36:46.420]  you give up that really you do have power see if you intellectually coldly
[1:36:46.420 --> 1:36:50.580]  understand all this and then allow yourself to trigger emotional anger as
[1:36:50.580 --> 1:36:55.020]  a weapon against them controlled anger controlled rage we're gonna beat these
[1:36:55.020 --> 1:37:08.060]  people okay now continuing then I'll go to your calls I was getting into different
[1:37:08.060 --> 1:37:13.820]  systems they use to control us well there's countless ones but the fact is
[1:37:13.820 --> 1:37:18.260]  they love things that are hidden hidden in the water hidden in the ether hidden
[1:37:18.260 --> 1:37:28.580]  in the air the chemtrails hidden in the electromagnetic frequency pollution hidden
[1:37:28.580 --> 1:37:32.860]  in the cloud oh there's a new way to keep your internet data you're gonna pay
[1:37:32.860 --> 1:37:36.100]  us for data storage you're not just gonna have your own data storage and have
[1:37:36.100 --> 1:37:40.700]  things you know tie in and control your own data we're gonna keep it safe up on
[1:37:40.700 --> 1:37:44.180]  our cloud and what came out yesterday in fact Matt Matt we reprinted for me the
[1:37:44.180 --> 1:37:48.420]  article about Amazon's cloud not safe it was a report yesterday I think it was
[1:37:48.420 --> 1:37:52.260]  even New York Times that the cloud is accessible of course it is they force
[1:37:52.260 --> 1:37:57.940]  you on RFID in the last ten years RFIDs in in credit cards are getting stolen
[1:37:57.940 --> 1:38:01.500]  everywhere their answer is well now you live RFID as I told you ten years ago
[1:38:01.500 --> 1:38:06.260]  with a face scan or thumb print to make sure double now they're sucking you
[1:38:06.260 --> 1:38:12.460]  deeper into the web then people fake those authenticators then that's even
[1:38:12.460 --> 1:38:19.180]  more there it is no privacy on Amazon's cloud drive that's a ZD net of course
[1:38:19.180 --> 1:38:23.620]  there's no privacy when you sign up for it they tell you there's no privacy but
[1:38:23.620 --> 1:38:27.660]  it's the new great thing you say well I just won't use the cloud oh really your
[1:38:27.660 --> 1:38:33.380]  wife's gonna want the new iPhone 6 that comes out in a year you're gonna want
[1:38:33.380 --> 1:38:39.580]  that new ski boat and sorry it's not gonna start it's a GPS isn't gonna work
[1:38:39.580 --> 1:38:44.260]  it's it's satellite radio is not gonna work because it's all gonna be cloud
[1:38:44.260 --> 1:38:48.940]  based sorry and that's what the technocrats have bragged about in
[1:38:48.940 --> 1:38:53.700]  wash tech weekly and in Pentagon reports that have been public and in the other
[1:38:53.700 --> 1:39:00.020]  big reports they've put out in MIT's monthly magazine is that I'll never
[1:39:00.020 --> 1:39:05.300]  forget those that those documents from 77 that were declassified by the Federation
[1:39:05.300 --> 1:39:09.740]  of American Scientists and it was a mistake the army asked that it be
[1:39:09.740 --> 1:39:15.660]  reclassified that the Pentagon to the army did I'll never forget in 2000 they
[1:39:15.660 --> 1:39:20.700]  released it and I've it's in my book to sit in the tyranny that's online at
[1:39:20.700 --> 1:39:26.140]  present planet dot TV the books now on a print but you can find it online and I
[1:39:26.140 --> 1:39:32.220]  forget the exact name of the document but the Pentagon said in phases we'll
[1:39:32.220 --> 1:39:36.220]  sell it in security and in captive populations like the military and
[1:39:36.220 --> 1:39:42.620]  prisoners but also for the elderly and for security and in passports and
[1:39:42.620 --> 1:39:48.140]  driver's license and then and then we'll phase in more technology where you at
[1:39:48.140 --> 1:39:51.420]  first won't have to be part of it but you're not gonna be able to drive or
[1:39:51.420 --> 1:39:56.580]  work or live and then those people will basically live in ghettos and will be
[1:39:56.580 --> 1:40:00.900]  separate from society and they predicted less than 1% would not join and
[1:40:00.900 --> 1:40:10.260]  that by 2025 the large portions of the public would be inserted into pods and
[1:40:10.260 --> 1:40:16.580]  that wiring and chips would be added to the brain now this is this is the
[1:40:16.580 --> 1:40:19.940]  Pentagon and that they would slowly phase it out and that people would
[1:40:19.940 --> 1:40:23.140]  voluntarily enter it then they had that movie came out a few years ago with
[1:40:23.140 --> 1:40:28.500]  Bruce Willis where everybody lives at home and they have their their biological
[1:40:28.500 --> 1:40:32.420]  surrogates you know they have this electronic Android that goes out for
[1:40:32.420 --> 1:40:35.540]  them all Pentagon all laid out you're gonna well that's just Pentagon
[1:40:35.540 --> 1:40:40.620]  theorizing no that's the plan that's the plan and that's the level before they
[1:40:40.620 --> 1:40:45.740]  go to the pod and that's where the whole matrix comes from the Pentagon plan is
[1:40:45.740 --> 1:40:49.620]  that you're gonna live in a tank okay and you say well that's not gonna happen
[1:40:49.620 --> 1:40:54.620]  well folks they're trying is the point you're gonna live in a tank and be tied
[1:40:54.620 --> 1:40:59.340]  into this virtual world and look people already spend real money in all these
[1:40:59.340 --> 1:41:03.700]  second-life video games all the rest of it and pay thousands of dollars for
[1:41:03.700 --> 1:41:08.780]  wardrobes and Ferraris and they even meet women and and become prominent
[1:41:08.780 --> 1:41:13.180]  become and the system makes them celebrities a few of them to make you
[1:41:13.180 --> 1:41:18.580]  all pile in and so if people are already ready to give up their money to be
[1:41:18.580 --> 1:41:21.780]  part of an imaginary world by the millions there's a whole bunch of
[1:41:21.780 --> 1:41:24.780]  different systems what are they gonna do
[1:41:24.780 --> 1:41:30.020]  Philip K. Dick wrote about this 30 years ago the wire heads it turns out Philip
[1:41:30.020 --> 1:41:33.780]  K. Dick I've talked to people that know his family well the family I'm gonna
[1:41:33.780 --> 1:41:39.060]  just leave it at that I'm not well he was his house was broken into he was
[1:41:39.060 --> 1:41:42.100]  being followed by the government family didn't believe it till they witnessed it
[1:41:42.100 --> 1:41:47.740]  dick lived in San Francisco knew some of the future of society people knew some
[1:41:47.740 --> 1:41:53.740]  of the what is it the the organization of psychedelic research which had a
[1:41:53.740 --> 1:41:56.580]  bunch of government connections not gonna get into what they're interfacing
[1:41:56.580 --> 1:42:02.420]  with but they believe they're in contact with off-world groups I mean this is
[1:42:02.420 --> 1:42:07.180]  what the government's into folks they're taking the DMT they've got the black op
[1:42:07.180 --> 1:42:11.700]  commanders gobbling high-powered hallucinogens in see I don't even get
[1:42:11.700 --> 1:42:16.540]  into all this stuff it we're in trouble ladies and gentlemen we're in trouble the
[1:42:16.540 --> 1:42:21.180]  clockwork elves all of it I shouldn't even get into it but the issue here is
[1:42:21.180 --> 1:42:26.980]  that whether this stuff's real or not the globalist think it is and the elves
[1:42:26.980 --> 1:42:33.260]  are telling them come on join us plug in it's gonna happen people read dick
[1:42:33.260 --> 1:42:37.300]  stuff 30 years ago and they go how did it all come true because he had government
[1:42:37.300 --> 1:42:42.820]  connections ladies and gentlemen PKD was was being fed this stuff and he got a
[1:42:42.820 --> 1:42:47.220]  several of his novels stolen and got threatened and a lot of other stuff
[1:42:47.220 --> 1:42:54.500]  happened but I'm not ranting the point is is that the CIA people and if you go
[1:42:54.500 --> 1:42:57.500]  back they're the ones that gave out the ingredients for LSD on the college
[1:42:57.500 --> 1:43:01.340]  campuses they're the ones that synthesize DMT they're the ones that did
[1:43:01.340 --> 1:43:05.100]  all of this the owners of time-life books in the 40s were obsessed with this
[1:43:05.100 --> 1:43:09.340]  they believe they're communicating with entities they call them clockwork elves
[1:43:09.340 --> 1:43:13.660]  Joe Rogan talks about he takes it you see the elves little green hats there's a
[1:43:13.660 --> 1:43:17.940]  reason all cultures see the elves I'm not into this I don't take it let's say
[1:43:17.940 --> 1:43:21.980]  it's not real okay I don't want national news to say Jones believes in elves the
[1:43:21.980 --> 1:43:26.620]  elite okay and most these old men you see at Bilderberg there's a reason they're
[1:43:26.620 --> 1:43:29.860]  all whacked out of their minds they're taking DMT you think they're all a
[1:43:29.860 --> 1:43:34.340]  bunch of old men they're in power because they were into this stuff 70 years
[1:43:34.340 --> 1:43:41.180]  ago they were jacking DMT 70 years ago they were injecting it they were in
[1:43:41.180 --> 1:43:47.740]  special tanks they their whole their whole science is way ahead we don't
[1:43:47.740 --> 1:43:53.420]  even know what they've got and the point is is that they want to just by by
[1:43:53.420 --> 1:43:57.740]  phasing this in you'll be able to wire your head in and just get unlimited
[1:43:57.740 --> 1:44:02.500]  pleasure it'll feel like ten times the best orgasm for three days if you want
[1:44:02.500 --> 1:44:06.340]  straight and and that and that people will not eat they will in starve to death
[1:44:06.340 --> 1:44:09.540]  they've done the test with monkeys I've been led into the UT facility they've
[1:44:09.540 --> 1:44:13.220]  been doing these tests for 50 years there's they're doing them right now with
[1:44:13.220 --> 1:44:16.220]  flicker rates with televisions in front of monkeys heads they got the monkey
[1:44:16.220 --> 1:44:20.180]  research center out in Bastrop with TV screens hooked up at the sack warfare
[1:44:20.180 --> 1:44:23.260]  center run by the Pentagon at UT I'm not even supposed to talk about the fact I've
[1:44:23.260 --> 1:44:27.220]  been letting there repeatedly and there's monkeys strapped in with TV screens
[1:44:27.220 --> 1:44:32.020]  flipping American Idol background scatter on the monkeys testing the
[1:44:32.020 --> 1:44:35.820]  algorithm in their brain and how to put in carrier waves over it to put them
[1:44:35.820 --> 1:44:40.660]  into a deep sleep process just haven't helped us it's so hardcore people don't
[1:44:40.660 --> 1:44:44.860]  even believe it but that's the kind of stuff I never even get into because
[1:44:44.860 --> 1:44:49.500]  you're not ready for it the globalists don't believe in satanism they believe
[1:44:49.500 --> 1:44:54.900]  they're contacting interdimensional aliens through the drug use and through
[1:44:54.900 --> 1:44:59.540]  the electronic interface and they believe actually right about Ray Kurzweil
[1:44:59.540 --> 1:45:02.940]  all of them that they're gonna merge with the machines blast off into
[1:45:02.940 --> 1:45:06.700]  hyperdimensional space and that's why they're so crazy that's why they want
[1:45:06.700 --> 1:45:10.220]  to get rid of us that's why they're smiling and giddy and acting so nuts
[1:45:10.220 --> 1:45:14.620]  because they believe if you're a psychiatrist or you and are hearing
[1:45:14.620 --> 1:45:19.500]  this understand whether it's real or not they believe they are in contact with
[1:45:19.500 --> 1:45:23.540]  these entities and are being directed by them that's why they're so evil and the
[1:45:23.540 --> 1:45:27.780]  entities are telling them eternal life total power total control everything you
[1:45:27.780 --> 1:45:31.420]  could ever want just kill everyone set up a world government build this design
[1:45:31.420 --> 1:45:35.180]  we're telling you build what we're telling you build this build this let us
[1:45:35.180 --> 1:45:39.100]  through build the Hadron Collider open the dimensions let us in we're gonna
[1:45:39.100 --> 1:45:45.580]  really help you we're friendly little guys demons aliens don't exist I don't
[1:45:45.580 --> 1:45:50.100]  know I only cover what I can prove but now I'm telling you one of the big
[1:45:50.100 --> 1:45:54.780]  secrets of the elite okay and that gets pretty David Ike I don't know if any of
[1:45:54.780 --> 1:45:59.220]  that stuff's real ladies and gentlemen but the point is that's what the elite
[1:45:59.220 --> 1:46:02.580]  are into that's what they believe that's what's going on and I know people
[1:46:02.580 --> 1:46:08.180]  separately who lived in San Francisco that knew PKD and other people and the
[1:46:08.180 --> 1:46:11.820]  government folks involved in all of it I get a lot of information at this level
[1:46:11.820 --> 1:46:16.980]  oh my god we're screwed we're in so much trouble ladies and gentlemen we've got a
[1:46:16.980 --> 1:46:20.420]  bunch of lunatic elites thinking they're talking a little gray men who are
[1:46:20.420 --> 1:46:23.500]  telling them how to get eternal life does that sound like a good idea to you
[1:46:23.500 --> 1:46:28.180]  whatever it is they believe it whether it's I mean why would there be in every
[1:46:28.180 --> 1:46:35.340]  culture you can get a Chinese person they've gone and given DMT to tribes
[1:46:35.340 --> 1:46:39.860]  that have never been in human human human contact and they see the little the
[1:46:39.860 --> 1:46:44.220]  little gray men the little elves with the with the with the green hats and they
[1:46:44.220 --> 1:46:49.020]  fly around with Santa Claus alright folks okay and now I've just got into a
[1:46:49.020 --> 1:46:51.340]  whole other area here with you I'm just gonna get real here on the show from
[1:46:51.340 --> 1:46:58.780]  here on out okay yeah here it is army names top builders of virtual worlds
[1:46:58.780 --> 1:47:03.660]  army seek smart bots in virtual world and see here's the problem everything I
[1:47:03.660 --> 1:47:16.540]  just told you search this Pentagon Pentagon Pentagon studies and DMT I
[1:47:16.540 --> 1:47:20.580]  mean it just goes on around the point is whether it is some group consciousness
[1:47:20.580 --> 1:47:24.340]  thing in our brain that isn't real or whether it is real I don't know and I
[1:47:24.340 --> 1:47:29.820]  don't get into things like that but the point is the elites believe they're in
[1:47:29.820 --> 1:47:35.980]  contact okay they think it's real I won't take DMT to find out that I don't
[1:47:35.980 --> 1:47:39.980]  recommend you take it either supposedly hallucinate for about five minutes don't
[1:47:39.980 --> 1:47:44.620]  even know where you are and it can it can you know all the other the heads of
[1:47:44.620 --> 1:47:49.420]  the 60s that it turned out were CIA and FBI you know all the main guys it turned
[1:47:49.420 --> 1:47:54.020]  out you know who see the the mescalito and they take enough peyote the little
[1:47:54.020 --> 1:48:00.140]  elf they're not seeing pink elephants folks and these little elves they're
[1:48:00.140 --> 1:48:03.820]  telling them do this do that a lot of these scientists will tell you oh we
[1:48:03.820 --> 1:48:07.420]  we got this idea to go this way in technology from the clockwork elves oh
[1:48:07.420 --> 1:48:12.860]  they build things yes they do now I'm not saying any of this is real but the
[1:48:12.860 --> 1:48:19.140]  Pentagon is whole hog in this stuff for 40 50 years I mean they are completely
[1:48:19.140 --> 1:48:23.660]  obsessed with it they put out the ingredients of DMT they put out the
[1:48:23.660 --> 1:48:28.500]  ingredients of LSD they put out the ingredients of PCP they actually want
[1:48:28.500 --> 1:48:32.060]  you taking it and the question is why do they want you taking it because they
[1:48:32.060 --> 1:48:35.460]  want to open something up and some will argue well it's good to have a
[1:48:35.460 --> 1:48:39.380]  psychedelic experience and to be able to reach out and expand your consciousness
[1:48:39.380 --> 1:48:44.940]  but the question is why does the Bible say don't do it because it opens up
[1:48:44.940 --> 1:48:48.780]  other worlds is it other worlds in our consciousness is it something in our
[1:48:48.780 --> 1:48:52.460]  subconscious maybe it's only in our brain I don't know but I shouldn't have
[1:48:52.460 --> 1:48:59.380]  even gone there the point is it just gets crazier by the minute Pentagon's
[1:48:59.380 --> 1:49:05.980]  Cold War mind control test launch chemical concussions and secret LSD yeah
[1:49:05.980 --> 1:49:12.740]  that's that stuff from the 40s and 50s yeah I don't see the DMT studies yeah I
[1:49:12.740 --> 1:49:18.380]  don't need DMT to see how evil these globalist are let's go ahead and I'm
[1:49:18.380 --> 1:49:23.740]  sorry for ranting let's go to Clarice in Italy thanks for holding Clarice
[1:49:23.740 --> 1:49:32.420]  Alex hi Alex I was there at the protest this weekend and I'll tell you it was
[1:49:32.420 --> 1:49:38.020]  frightening to walk around that place in that town because it seemed to me to be
[1:49:38.020 --> 1:49:43.700]  a replay of pre-war war one pre-war war two where in the town there were
[1:49:43.700 --> 1:49:48.780]  meetings with the well now the socialist communists I don't know what that group
[1:49:48.780 --> 1:49:53.140]  is about but I saw that group meeting in one square another square sort of a
[1:49:53.140 --> 1:49:59.980]  fascist meeting another square another one and they're already compartmentalizing
[1:49:59.980 --> 1:50:04.700]  to set up for this and already training men that if anyone is an individual
[1:50:04.700 --> 1:50:10.460]  speaking out or says something that offend you or you turn them in I mean
[1:50:10.460 --> 1:50:16.020]  they're already doing it and it's it's frightening and not only that to have to
[1:50:16.020 --> 1:50:22.140]  be in that place and see all of this symbolism as well and then being there
[1:50:22.140 --> 1:50:28.780]  the day of Saturday when there was a practically an open confrontation with
[1:50:28.780 --> 1:50:36.060]  the protesters and the Bilderbergs coming back from their walk sounds interesting
[1:50:36.060 --> 1:50:40.460]  you want to finish up your perspective from Italy on Bilderberg 2011 across the
[1:50:40.460 --> 1:50:45.780]  border there in Switzerland I think it was very energetic and there were women
[1:50:45.780 --> 1:50:53.100]  there all of the protesters I'd say 90% were young men between the ages of 18
[1:50:53.100 --> 1:51:01.940]  and 28 and very resistant stay there I'm gonna come back to you if you drive for
[1:51:01.940 --> 1:51:07.340]  a living you don't get paid to stop or wait in line keep your wheels moving

[1:52:10.220 --> 1:52:14.260]  this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[1:52:14.260 --> 1:52:19.380]  have tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really
[1:52:19.380 --> 1:52:24.180]  are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[1:52:24.180 --> 1:52:28.540]  citizens to pay attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[1:52:28.540 --> 1:52:33.820]  nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on

[1:54:19.180 --> 1:54:24.820]  documents that I put my books into turning they ran out and then told the
[1:54:24.820 --> 1:54:28.420]  Federation American scientist reclassify that we know you said you could
[1:54:28.420 --> 1:54:33.540]  release that but reclassified and they say that by progression slowly getting
[1:54:33.540 --> 1:54:37.700]  us into technology and then faster and faster they will dehumanize us they will
[1:54:37.700 --> 1:54:41.740]  take all our basic humanity away and that finally that will live in a virtual
[1:54:41.740 --> 1:54:49.100]  reality from birth wired into this virtual reality now that's called a
[1:54:49.100 --> 1:54:53.620]  prison and that's called taking our humanity away and making us totally
[1:54:53.620 --> 1:54:57.180]  dependent on the system and a lot of evidence shows that's a lie they're
[1:54:57.180 --> 1:55:00.940]  just gonna promise that to people you'll just basically be killed and by the
[1:55:00.940 --> 1:55:05.860]  time it gets to that there'll be huge bioplegs giant wars in world war three
[1:55:05.860 --> 1:55:09.460]  things like that so folks will be more accepting and and and whether these
[1:55:09.460 --> 1:55:13.980]  these government people hallucinating or not are found something real or
[1:55:13.980 --> 1:55:18.500]  they're just collectively insane you look at all the other insane people
[1:55:18.500 --> 1:55:23.580]  throughout history elites generally get into really weird stuff but you got to
[1:55:23.580 --> 1:55:28.300]  give them credit they really are building this system so while we're busy
[1:55:28.300 --> 1:55:35.140]  talking about LeBron James and being unsportsmanlike or was he every major
[1:55:35.140 --> 1:55:39.220]  GMO crop in studies you look it up just pick one look it up pick a crop that's
[1:55:39.220 --> 1:55:46.060]  GMO cross species it caused massive infertility in every rodent species given
[1:55:46.060 --> 1:55:51.540]  it you can pick any of the major ones I think that's pretty big news but see
[1:55:51.540 --> 1:55:59.740]  it's hidden there in plain view it's hidden there in plain view and people
[1:55:59.740 --> 1:56:02.620]  like well I can't see it it's magic you're telling me there's something in
[1:56:02.620 --> 1:56:08.020]  that corn that is hurting me on Santo GMO corn link to organ failure study
[1:56:08.020 --> 1:56:11.380]  reveals you know there's a big report on it also infertility but that's just one
[1:56:11.380 --> 1:56:19.820]  report I mean people a thousand years ago what I thought radio was magic see
[1:56:19.820 --> 1:56:23.700]  whatever people can't see they think is magic they're poison the water you can't
[1:56:23.700 --> 1:56:29.580]  see it magic they're poison the GMO crops magic it's not magic magic just means
[1:56:29.580 --> 1:56:33.100]  hidden a cult just means hidden and that's what the globalists are all
[1:56:33.100 --> 1:56:36.420]  about they know everything you're doing you know nothing they're doing they're
[1:56:36.420 --> 1:56:40.980]  hidden you're out in the open let's go back to Clara then I go to Kyle Richard

[1:56:53.940 --> 1:57:00.100]  fantastic thing I'd ever experienced humidity at its finest on our part I
[1:57:00.100 --> 1:57:05.020]  I'm telling you Alex all of the protesters young and old predominantly
[1:57:05.020 --> 1:57:12.580]  male all very concerned about us women myself I'm 51 I was not ill treated by

[1:57:17.540 --> 1:57:23.620]  venue was there Birmingham we are changed Germany we are changed and those
[1:57:23.620 --> 1:57:29.860]  people were complete gentlemen and I went there to follow suit because I feel
[1:57:29.860 --> 1:57:36.700]  I found the key to what the elite covet they covet the law and they're very
[1:57:36.700 --> 1:57:41.580]  snug in it and I followed the suit I sent copies off to the White House to the
[1:57:41.580 --> 1:57:46.780]  Supreme Court to the Papal Court and I said it off the Sunday before going to
[1:57:46.780 --> 1:57:53.300]  Bilderberg may I read a quick sure where did you file your suit against who sir
[1:57:53.300 --> 1:58:00.300]  what court did you file the suit in the Supreme Court the U.S. Supreme Court I

[1:58:05.780 --> 1:58:08.820]  that that would have to be filed in a federal court before get to the Supreme
[1:58:08.820 --> 1:58:13.460]  Court and I'm sure it'd be nice reading for them it would need to go through the

[2:00:57.340 --> 2:01:03.460]  from Cedar Falls VR change I wanted to give you a follow-up you had posted a
[2:01:03.460 --> 2:01:08.380]  story that I was involved with yesterday about the City Council lockboxes they
[2:01:08.380 --> 2:01:12.140]  just had their final vote yesterday and they did decide to vote against the
[2:01:12.140 --> 2:01:18.100]  Fourth Amendment in spite of the City Hall being packed with people
[2:01:18.100 --> 2:01:23.620]  overflowing into secondary rooms with TVs for people everyone must have a box
[2:01:23.620 --> 2:01:28.180]  on their house with keys for the government to get in your house doing
[2:01:28.180 --> 2:01:33.060]  emergencies as if firemen don't have an axe so they can knock it down if you're
[2:01:33.060 --> 2:01:39.140]  not there just it's absolutely idiotic but again they use any excuse they can
[2:01:39.140 --> 2:01:42.900]  they stands for one thing it's for another on record you have an Indiana
[2:01:42.900 --> 2:01:46.620]  their Supreme Court ruling no Fourth Amendment for any reason just any time
[2:01:46.620 --> 2:01:52.180]  they feel like it well why'd we ever have one to begin with yeah exactly the
[2:01:52.180 --> 2:01:56.460]  that's to make it easier for the FBI would sneak in peaks to go in your house
[2:01:56.460 --> 2:02:00.100]  and they're trying to pass that nationwide where you have the keys right
[2:02:00.100 --> 2:02:05.020]  there for the loving government yeah absolutely and you know that they didn't
[2:02:05.020 --> 2:02:10.820]  have any data to show or to validate their points of safety which is
[2:02:10.820 --> 2:02:16.340]  obviously ridiculous to begin with you know everyone who spoke last night was
[2:02:16.340 --> 2:02:20.260]  fairly eloquent they they got hit from a lot of different angles everyone make
[2:02:20.260 --> 2:02:24.940]  good points but follow a bunch of lawsuits on them that'll teach them
[2:02:24.940 --> 2:02:30.900]  they'll pull out also also in the interim let them start trying to find
[2:02:30.900 --> 2:02:34.940]  people for not having the the the lockbox on their house like your houses
[2:02:34.940 --> 2:02:40.940]  you know run by the real estate agent in the sky yeah well what it is it's for
[2:02:40.940 --> 2:02:44.620]  triplexes and above and all commercial properties but I mean the way things are
[2:02:44.620 --> 2:02:48.100]  going you know as well as I do that eventually it will be everyone's houses
[2:02:48.100 --> 2:02:52.460]  what's gonna happen is people are just gonna break into those and get the whole
[2:02:52.460 --> 2:02:56.620]  gaggle of keys and rob a bunch of houses all right it's already happened in
[2:02:56.620 --> 2:03:00.740]  Seattle there was a two teenagers that broke into these lockboxes and so about
[2:03:00.740 --> 2:03:05.100]  $800,000 worth of equipment they the fire chief said that it's never happened
[2:03:05.100 --> 2:03:11.260]  and we corrected him on that even though it took to no effect obviously and we
[2:03:11.260 --> 2:03:16.060]  were talking to some lockpick experts and the medical locks that they use on
[2:03:16.060 --> 2:03:21.420]  these are according to them the easiest locks to break into anyone can go and buy
[2:03:21.420 --> 2:03:27.500]  a drill bit it's gonna cause crime to explode again and I'm sure the fire
[2:03:27.500 --> 2:03:30.100]  chief means well this is this bureaucratic nanny state attitude but
[2:03:30.100 --> 2:03:34.060]  the reason this is being pushed everywhere is to train you under federal
[2:03:34.060 --> 2:03:36.980]  inspection and inspectors come in your house without warrants they have towns
[2:03:36.980 --> 2:03:40.540]  in Illinois where they come in to make sure more than the amount of people
[2:03:40.540 --> 2:03:43.060]  they're allowed to live there aren't living there they check for toothbrushes
[2:03:43.060 --> 2:03:47.020]  to see you get fined if there's three toothbrushes and your house is allowed to
[2:03:47.020 --> 2:03:50.220]  have to you can't make this if you're new looser folks I'm not joking about any
[2:03:50.220 --> 2:03:55.620]  of those truth-stranger than fiction as they say and that's why they have a
[2:03:55.620 --> 2:03:59.980]  fire axe and you go right through the door and it takes about an extra second
[2:03:59.980 --> 2:04:03.900]  I guarantee you it's easier to hack down doors with an axe or with a battering
[2:04:03.900 --> 2:04:07.900]  ram than to go to a box in a fire and go through all the keys in the dark and
[2:04:07.900 --> 2:04:11.300]  then find it and go to it knock them down there's a fire it's a cheap door
[2:04:11.300 --> 2:04:15.900]  knock it down knock you got probable causes flame shooting out knock it down
[2:04:15.900 --> 2:04:22.500]  you know stinking key so so they passed it huh yeah yeah there's there was one
[2:04:22.500 --> 2:04:27.220]  councilman who kept raising fourth amendment issues good figure he's a
[2:04:27.220 --> 2:04:33.580]  Ron Paul supporter I have to speak with him at length but you know this is
[2:04:33.580 --> 2:04:36.740]  already hit the drug report it's been on your website and some other media outlets
[2:04:36.740 --> 2:04:42.980]  me and my associate jet we started a group called taking back America which is
[2:04:42.980 --> 2:04:49.140]  kind of a semi-fee party based that yeah your videos up there see we're all
[2:04:49.140 --> 2:04:53.820]  together on this and thank God for the drudge reporters a new headline secret
[2:04:53.820 --> 2:05:01.380]  us grand jury investigating CIA war crimes at Abu Ghraib maybe some justice
[2:05:01.900 --> 2:05:05.740]  hi folks this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the silver lungs
[2:05:05.740 --> 2:05:10.500]  generator now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the
[2:05:10.500 --> 2:05:14.420]  solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the
[2:05:14.420 --> 2:05:18.300]  lungs the respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne
[2:05:18.300 --> 2:05:23.260]  pathogens and viruses the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system
[2:05:23.260 --> 2:05:28.540]  with your self-produced nano silver solutions and also delivers the silver
[2:05:28.540 --> 2:05:33.140]  nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream with continued legislation
[2:05:33.140 --> 2:05:37.340]  threatening the sale of nano silver products you can now produce pure and
[2:05:37.340 --> 2:05:42.220]  endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs generator very easy to follow
[2:05:42.220 --> 2:05:46.700]  step-by-step instructions are provided making production fast and simple go
[2:05:46.700 --> 2:05:51.900]  to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough
[2:05:51.900 --> 2:05:58.700]  technology of the silver lungs generator that's www.silverlungs.com
[2:06:01.340 --> 2:06:06.100]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[2:06:06.100 --> 2:06:11.620]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that
[2:06:11.620 --> 2:06:15.340]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've turned members
[2:06:15.340 --> 2:06:20.380]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[2:06:20.380 --> 2:06:25.780]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[2:06:25.780 --> 2:06:30.700]  the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[2:06:30.700 --> 2:06:35.100]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[2:06:35.100 --> 2:06:38.820]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more
[2:06:38.820 --> 2:06:42.780]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[2:06:42.780 --> 2:06:48.420]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the
[2:06:48.420 --> 2:06:54.460]  Republic yet your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at info wars.com we're
[2:06:54.460 --> 2:07:00.740]  watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv this is
[2:07:00.740 --> 2:07:04.100]  Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[2:07:04.100 --> 2:07:08.060]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[2:07:08.060 --> 2:07:12.300]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[2:07:12.300 --> 2:07:16.580]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[2:07:16.580 --> 2:07:20.940]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[2:07:20.940 --> 2:07:25.060]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[2:07:25.060 --> 2:07:29.540]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[2:07:29.540 --> 2:07:33.700]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[2:07:33.700 --> 2:07:37.660]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[2:07:37.660 --> 2:07:41.500]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[2:07:41.500 --> 2:07:44.220]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[2:07:44.220 --> 2:07:50.220]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[2:07:50.220 --> 2:07:53.940]  that's my solar back up dot com remember the government doesn't own the
[2:07:53.940 --> 2:08:07.620]  sun so go to my solar back up dot com or call 1-877-327-0365 big brother mainstream
[2:08:07.620 --> 2:08:15.500]  media government coverups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on
[2:08:15.500 --> 2:08:25.980]  the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones well
[2:08:25.980 --> 2:08:32.180]  everybody's being told get on to the CIA cloud well beware of the clouds my
[2:08:32.180 --> 2:08:35.860]  friends we've told you this is part of internet to where all your data is
[2:08:35.860 --> 2:08:39.540]  stored off-site and the government and other corporations can just go through
[2:08:39.540 --> 2:08:46.180]  it will and here it is out of Z that news no privacy on Amazon's cloud drive
[2:08:46.180 --> 2:08:51.180]  and it's gonna be the same thing for Apple and all the rest of them section
[2:08:51.180 --> 2:08:56.020]  5.2 says they have the right to access your files they have you wave all your
[2:08:56.020 --> 2:09:00.180]  rights under the cloud to give it to whoever they want whenever they want
[2:09:00.180 --> 2:09:04.340]  and now when government wants it without a warrant they just order them to give
[2:09:04.340 --> 2:09:10.980]  it the cloud is obviously extremely ominous and simply put the clouds are
[2:09:10.980 --> 2:09:16.180]  evil cloud computing is is a technology that's neutral but it's configured and
[2:09:16.180 --> 2:09:21.980]  set up that's like not having your wedding ring you know yourself but
[2:09:21.980 --> 2:09:26.780]  giving it to somebody else to keep and it's gonna cause more data theft more
[2:09:26.780 --> 2:09:30.620]  problems and they don't care they'll just ignore that and offer more tyranny
[2:09:30.620 --> 2:09:36.260]  as the solution also a report from Politico a federal prosecutor has
[2:09:36.260 --> 2:09:39.460]  launched a secret grand jury to investigate possible CIA war crimes
[2:09:39.460 --> 2:09:45.460]  at Abu Ghraib in Iraq time magazine is also reporting federal prosecutor John
[2:09:45.460 --> 2:09:49.780]  Durham who was first appointed to probe the destruction of CIA interrogation
[2:09:49.780 --> 2:09:54.620]  tapes by Attorney General Michael New Casey and O8 is now working on an
[2:09:54.620 --> 2:09:58.860]  expanded probe authorized by the Obama Justice Department and this is a
[2:09:58.860 --> 2:10:03.300]  desperate Obama ploy to use this as a weapon against the Republican Party to
[2:10:03.300 --> 2:10:07.100]  have them back off because he's on the verge of having to step down with the
[2:10:07.100 --> 2:10:13.100]  lowest approval rating in modern history when because these people are
[2:10:13.100 --> 2:10:16.460]  together on a team but when they start fighting over levers of power they will
[2:10:16.460 --> 2:10:21.540]  play dirty how about the federal prosecutor go after Bush he he bragged
[2:10:21.540 --> 2:10:24.660]  he ordered torture he did it again last year in press conferences and again
[2:10:24.660 --> 2:10:29.260]  this year they sent people to prison who followed orders and tortured why aren't
[2:10:29.260 --> 2:10:36.100]  the order givers going to jail so big news there and watch Republicans come
[2:10:36.100 --> 2:10:40.340]  out and go we got to support torture it's manly no it gave up America's soul
[2:10:40.340 --> 2:10:45.220]  it gave up our high ground it made the world hate us and it's part of a
[2:10:45.220 --> 2:10:50.700]  globalist plan that they released the Abu Ghraib oh it's bad they did it but
[2:10:50.700 --> 2:10:54.580]  but but again it's part of the demonization program of America to give
[2:10:54.580 --> 2:10:59.940]  the orders and then to release that it happened and it gets rid of the moral
[2:10:59.940 --> 2:11:04.980]  high ground worldwide where countries all over the world are saying hey torture
[2:11:04.980 --> 2:11:08.540]  is now good America does it remember the old days when our media criticized
[2:11:08.540 --> 2:11:12.700]  governments that arrested folks for unauthorized protest that arrested
[2:11:12.700 --> 2:11:19.500]  political dissidents well they can't do that anymore they can't do that because
[2:11:19.500 --> 2:11:28.660]  they've lost the moral high ground that was done intentionally lowering our
[2:11:28.660 --> 2:11:34.740]  standards that's all part of this larger program and now you talk about human
[2:11:34.740 --> 2:11:41.540]  cloning and no big deal now you talk about secret arrest or torture no big
[2:11:41.540 --> 2:11:46.740]  deal we're all being acclimated to accept all of this now I'm gonna cover
[2:11:46.740 --> 2:11:49.980]  some of the news this hour because he's such an interesting person he can talk
[2:11:49.980 --> 2:11:56.100]  basically on any subject that we raise and he's a genesis talk-so-host and he's
[2:11:56.100 --> 2:12:02.220]  a pharmacist by trade and by degree and now he is a nutritional pharmacist
[2:12:02.220 --> 2:12:06.180]  based in Boulder, Colorado believes that most prescription drugs are toxic and
[2:12:06.180 --> 2:12:10.460]  unnecessary and I really enjoy talking to him and listening to him because so
[2:12:10.460 --> 2:12:14.220]  much of the research he talks about is stuff that I've separately done my own
[2:12:14.220 --> 2:12:19.140]  research on he just specializes in this area so he can take us even further in
[2:12:19.140 --> 2:12:22.980]  our understanding and I wanted to look at one of the biggest places they attack
[2:12:22.980 --> 2:12:28.620]  us is through the statin drugs through the sodium fluoride through the GMO what
[2:12:28.620 --> 2:12:35.020]  the studies show what we know what the larger battle plan of big pharma is and
[2:12:35.020 --> 2:12:37.620]  we'll also take some of your calls I know you're holding they'll be all over
[2:12:37.620 --> 2:12:43.020]  the map but Ben can speak to all of that but Ben what do you make of the fact
[2:12:43.020 --> 2:12:46.120]  that the honey bees more than half of them are dead in the US and Western
[2:12:46.120 --> 2:12:53.380]  Europe it's a cocktail of cell phones also the BT corn it's been confirmed
[2:12:53.380 --> 2:12:58.540]  grows at a thousand times normal levels a natural pesticide in a fungus the
[2:12:58.540 --> 2:13:02.460]  honey bees are like humans they will still eat it a lot of GMO pigs and dogs
[2:13:02.460 --> 2:13:06.020]  other things won't eat because they're olfactory nerve is so good honey bees
[2:13:06.020 --> 2:13:10.700]  will eat the pollen that means it's just that and if the honey bees are dying
[2:13:10.700 --> 2:13:14.060]  what does that mean for us so many different diseases are off the charts I
[2:13:14.060 --> 2:13:17.980]  was at talkers with you I first want to get your take on that but just throwing
[2:13:17.980 --> 2:13:24.820]  out some of the things we'll talk about big elite conclave con fab of talk show
[2:13:24.820 --> 2:13:29.620]  hosts from around the country and CEOs and program directors and I noticed that
[2:13:29.620 --> 2:13:35.820]  when I brought up the fact that Western thought waves have lowered and then IQs
[2:13:35.820 --> 2:13:39.460]  have lowered a few of them said I was a liar and I went out on my iPhone
[2:13:39.460 --> 2:13:44.980]  microwaving myself during the break I'm addicted folks but I was already
[2:13:44.980 --> 2:13:49.260]  saturated in there by Wi-Fi so I was already an oven of it and I looked it up
[2:13:49.260 --> 2:13:52.940]  there was all these mainstream articles even admitting that IQs have dropped so
[2:13:52.940 --> 2:13:58.340]  they've lowered the metric on the IQ test and lowered the quality of the general
[2:13:58.340 --> 2:14:03.580]  SATs and others and also that generally to be technical our brainwaves
[2:14:03.580 --> 2:14:10.420]  haven't dropped over overall it's that we're in a lower brainwave state more
[2:14:10.420 --> 2:14:15.260]  often so so but if you average together we're in the lower state more often
[2:14:15.260 --> 2:14:19.500]  they're still able to go into a high brainwave associated with creativity and
[2:14:19.500 --> 2:14:24.300]  spiritual thoughts and and intuitiveness but generally what the average adult more
[2:14:24.300 --> 2:14:29.540]  than five hours average youth now more than six playing video games watching
[2:14:29.540 --> 2:14:33.740]  TV the studies are all on record that it lowers brain waves to a near sleep
[2:14:33.740 --> 2:14:39.100]  state pharmacist Ben Fuchs and talking to you I was amazed that you were so
[2:14:39.100 --> 2:14:43.020]  well informed on that subject as well we've had some arguments with talk show
[2:14:43.020 --> 2:14:47.940]  host out in the parlor I mean who could deny that physical intelligence not
[2:14:47.940 --> 2:14:51.980]  just education has dropped in America we've gone from number one to almost
[2:14:51.980 --> 2:14:56.260]  number was it 46 or something now guys look up U.S. and international
[2:14:56.260 --> 2:15:00.700]  education rankings Ben Fuchs good to have you here with us thank you so much
[2:15:00.700 --> 2:15:03.740]  Alex and there's so much that that you mentioned that is interesting to cover
[2:15:03.740 --> 2:15:07.340]  but the most important point I think that we should recognize is yes honey
[2:15:07.340 --> 2:15:11.260]  bees are dying and the water is polluted there's drugs in the water and the air is
[2:15:11.260 --> 2:15:14.780]  toxic and radiation leaking into the oceans there's all these places that it
[2:15:14.780 --> 2:15:17.780]  seems like the environment in the world itself is falling apart but there's one
[2:15:17.780 --> 2:15:21.420]  place where we can take control and that is over our health and that is my
[2:15:21.420 --> 2:15:24.820]  specialty and I'm telling you Alex and I'm telling you listeners there is so
[2:15:24.820 --> 2:15:29.580]  much we can do to improve the state of our health if we are sick then we are
[2:15:29.580 --> 2:15:32.700]  not able to withstand these abuses and the things that are happening to us
[2:15:32.700 --> 2:15:36.220]  there's no way we can care about government intrusion our lives if we're
[2:15:36.220 --> 2:15:38.980]  suffering from colon disease or for suffering from lung disease or we're
[2:15:38.980 --> 2:15:43.460]  suffering from depressed immunity so job by the way you're 50 you're 50 years
[2:15:43.460 --> 2:15:49.860]  old and I mean you look like you got the body of a 25-year-old well it's anybody
[2:15:49.860 --> 2:15:54.060]  can have the body of a 25-year-old it's job number one to exploit the healing
[2:15:54.060 --> 2:15:57.900]  power of the human body I have seen the most incredible dramatic things happen
[2:15:57.900 --> 2:16:01.980]  to blood pressure dropping in and and weight dropping in people's skin
[2:16:01.980 --> 2:16:06.540]  improving in the most incredible markers of health that it can only be called
[2:16:06.540 --> 2:16:10.740]  miraculous by mainstream medicine but what as I say on my radio program is
[2:16:10.740 --> 2:16:14.900]  business as usual for the human body because the body heals itself it's
[2:16:14.900 --> 2:16:20.700]  resistant to disease and it's designed to take stressors and use those stressors
[2:16:20.700 --> 2:16:25.500]  as incentives to build when you break a bone Alex the bone is stronger at the
[2:16:25.500 --> 2:16:30.140]  point of the break than it was before it was broken and to me that is emblematic
[2:16:30.140 --> 2:16:34.180]  of how the body responds like building muscle that's like making yourself
[2:16:34.180 --> 2:16:39.020]  problem-solve it's frustrating at first everywhere correct everywhere the brain
[2:16:39.020 --> 2:16:44.180]  forms a tighter wiring as you problem solve as you have stresses in your life
[2:16:44.180 --> 2:16:47.820]  be they physiologic stresses or emotional stresses or mental stresses the
[2:16:47.820 --> 2:16:52.260]  body is designed to become better in response to those stresses and that's
[2:16:52.260 --> 2:16:56.060]  what we want to understand and be able to exploit so when I see stresses and
[2:16:56.060 --> 2:17:00.020]  when I see problems in the environment and I see all the pollution that's going
[2:17:00.020 --> 2:17:03.580]  on in the world and I see all the it looks like the world's falling apart to
[2:17:03.580 --> 2:17:07.900]  me that's an opportunity to exploit the healing power of the human body but I
[2:17:07.900 --> 2:17:13.020]  agree we use the pressure against us by the globalist and make it fun to fight
[2:17:13.020 --> 2:17:20.580]  them then it becomes exciting and not a desperate chore but I still am in the
[2:17:20.580 --> 2:17:23.780]  phase and we have a lot of solutions as well we're gonna talk about them coming
[2:17:23.780 --> 2:17:28.340]  up of trying to get folks to recognize that there's a problem to begin with to
[2:17:28.340 --> 2:17:31.860]  get them out of the lower state of thinking to get them out of a couch
[2:17:31.860 --> 2:17:36.900]  potato spectator area so let's talk a little bit about your overall view of
[2:17:36.900 --> 2:17:43.140]  the talkers event where I was the keynote speaker this weekend and one of the
[2:17:43.140 --> 2:17:46.260]  few things folks didn't believe that the IQs have actually dropped even though
[2:17:46.260 --> 2:17:50.660]  you can just search that it's all over the news and that people are spending
[2:17:50.660 --> 2:17:56.740]  more time in an unnatural sleepwalking level of brainwaves well first of all
[2:17:56.740 --> 2:17:59.980]  hats off to you for entering into the belly of the beast because that's
[2:17:59.980 --> 2:18:03.980]  exactly where you were and as you said in your talk you may raise an interesting
[2:18:03.980 --> 2:18:07.060]  point you said if you guys thank you when you were talking to the talk show
[2:18:07.060 --> 2:18:09.740]  host you were saying if you guys think that you're gonna enter the new world
[2:18:09.740 --> 2:18:14.180]  order and and get padded on the head and become financially successful and
[2:18:14.180 --> 2:18:19.420]  becomes celebrities and not because have your heads cut off then you're then
[2:18:19.420 --> 2:18:22.220]  you're missing the point of the new world order because you guys are expend
[2:18:22.220 --> 2:18:26.020]  just as expendable as anybody else and I commend you for saying that right
[2:18:26.020 --> 2:18:30.500]  there right down the street from Fox News and NBC and ABC and all those other
[2:18:30.500 --> 2:18:33.700]  folks so thanks thank you very much for being there and thank you for saying
[2:18:33.700 --> 2:18:37.540]  that to all those people as far as brainwaves go you've got a four main
[2:18:37.540 --> 2:18:41.140]  brainwaves got theta waves you've got beta waves you've got alpha waves and
[2:18:41.140 --> 2:18:44.500]  then you have delta waves your creativity occurs in the theta and alpha
[2:18:44.500 --> 2:18:49.420]  state but the alpha state in the alpha state you're very receptive to messages
[2:18:49.420 --> 2:18:53.500]  to messaging and that's why when you drive by the golden arches you feel like
[2:18:53.500 --> 2:18:56.620]  you need to go in and get french fries even though you weren't hungry because
[2:18:56.620 --> 2:19:00.180]  when you were watching the commercial your brain slowed down into this alpha
[2:19:00.180 --> 2:19:04.460]  state and you were receptive and suggestive to those messages hypnotists
[2:19:04.460 --> 2:19:07.980]  know this well and this process of hypnosis and lowering brainwaves is
[2:19:07.980 --> 2:19:12.140]  exploited dramatically by marketers and by advertisers ever since the days of
[2:19:12.140 --> 2:19:16.920]  Edward Bernays who came up with the so-called torches of freedom marketing
[2:19:16.920 --> 2:19:21.860]  campaign that used that forced women or induced women to smoke cigarettes this
[2:19:21.860 --> 2:19:25.860]  manipulation of brains and manipulation of the human body and
[2:19:25.860 --> 2:19:30.660]  manipulation of biochemistry that began at the early 20th century has now
[2:19:30.660 --> 2:19:35.620]  reached a fever pitch and that's one of the reasons why we have Obama as a
[2:19:35.620 --> 2:19:39.740]  president today because he understood better than anybody else in fact his
[2:19:39.740 --> 2:19:43.900]  political campaign will be used as a case study for decades to come on how to
[2:19:43.900 --> 2:19:47.620]  use social networking how to use computers how to use high-tech in order
[2:19:47.620 --> 2:19:50.780]  to manipulate and convince people to do what they didn't think that they were
[2:19:50.780 --> 2:19:55.500]  going to do and so incredible finish up with that we'll take a few calls and
[2:19:55.500 --> 2:19:58.260]  we're gonna get into solutions with Ben Fuchs I'm sort of having him up
[2:19:58.260 --> 2:20:03.780]  frequently I love him just like Mike Adams what if a natural or man-made

[2:25:20.780 --> 2:25:25.860]  locking Montana down and calling out the army the army because they heard from
[2:25:25.860 --> 2:25:32.580]  neighbors he might be a dun dun dun survivalist let's say the guy's a bank
[2:25:32.580 --> 2:25:37.940]  robber we don't know the point is the hyperventilating the every news channel
[2:25:37.940 --> 2:25:44.620]  there's a guy who doesn't like the government I'm sorry going back to
[2:25:44.620 --> 2:25:48.780]  pharmacist Ben Fuchs this is all part of the hyping where they create a fetish of
[2:25:48.780 --> 2:25:55.060]  fear and I'm sorry I'm ranting getting back to the brainwave situation you were
[2:25:55.060 --> 2:25:58.460]  talking about Alex when you're scared number one you don't do your best
[2:25:58.460 --> 2:26:01.700]  thinking but number two your stress hormone levels go up and your immune
[2:26:01.700 --> 2:26:05.740]  system drops and that's what you want to be so careful of if you are under
[2:26:05.740 --> 2:26:08.500]  stress and you're worried in your and you're fearful and you have anxiety
[2:26:08.500 --> 2:26:13.180]  levels high anxiety levels you are not able to withstand the E. coli you're not
[2:26:13.180 --> 2:26:17.420]  able to withstand the drugs in the water you're not able to withstand the the
[2:26:17.420 --> 2:26:20.820]  radiation that's in the water and in the fish and in the food so what you
[2:26:20.820 --> 2:26:25.900]  want to do is you want to make sure Matthew 1016 wise as a serpent gentle as
[2:26:25.900 --> 2:26:29.420]  it does you want to know what's going on you want to not be stupid you want to
[2:26:29.420 --> 2:26:32.700]  understand the manipulation that's occurring all around us and make
[2:26:32.700 --> 2:26:37.660]  absolutely sure you are taking care of your health using nutrition using
[2:26:37.660 --> 2:26:41.940]  nutritional supplementation and for God's sake disengaging from the machine
[2:26:41.940 --> 2:26:46.780]  by not eating the crap every time you drive by Taco Bell you want to think
[2:26:46.780 --> 2:26:50.660]  that's the terrorist you know the terrorist isn't necessarily the guy
[2:26:50.660 --> 2:26:55.020]  the turban who's coming on the plane it's the tacos and it's the the fast food
[2:26:55.020 --> 2:27:00.460]  and it's the process to see the poison in the water the the frequency
[2:27:00.460 --> 2:27:04.300]  pollution we're not taught to see the real things that are really attacking
[2:27:04.300 --> 2:27:07.860]  our bodies right that's the thing that you want to be able to withstand if you
[2:27:07.860 --> 2:27:11.420]  want to be powerful to be able to take care of to be able to withstand the
[2:27:11.420 --> 2:27:15.700]  abuses that are occurring in our environment job number one is to not eat
[2:27:15.700 --> 2:27:18.900]  the crap is to make sure you're taking care of your health using nutrition
[2:27:18.900 --> 2:27:22.860]  nutritional supplementation making sure you you're moving your body around you
[2:27:22.860 --> 2:27:26.660]  know people didn't get cancer and heart disease to the degree they did to the
[2:27:26.660 --> 2:27:29.900]  degree we're doing to we're getting it today 150 years ago because they were
[2:27:29.900 --> 2:27:34.420]  chopping wood and they were a walk into the store and they were out farming and
[2:27:34.420 --> 2:27:37.660]  they were moving their lymphatic system and they were exercising and they were
[2:27:37.660 --> 2:27:41.260]  breathing a clean air and so what we want to make sure we're doing today is
[2:27:41.260 --> 2:27:46.620]  we're understanding maximally how our bodies work and that's the to me that's
[2:27:46.620 --> 2:27:50.540]  the biggest crisis we have is this ignorance over our human bodies this
[2:27:50.540 --> 2:27:55.620]  incredible 100 trillion cell machine that we are gifted with for a hundred
[2:27:55.620 --> 2:28:00.140]  years up to 120 years we get to have possession of this amazing healing
[2:28:00.140 --> 2:28:03.740]  system and we don't even know where our pancreas is or what our pancreas does
[2:28:03.740 --> 2:28:07.220]  and this ignorance around the human body and this ignorance around how we
[2:28:07.220 --> 2:28:11.620]  treat the human body has got to stop because until it does until it does
[2:28:11.620 --> 2:28:15.100]  stop we are going to become we're going to be nothing but fodder for this
[2:28:15.100 --> 2:28:20.980]  machine-new-world order that is bent on our enslavement and our robot turning
[2:28:20.980 --> 2:28:25.140]  us all into robots it becomes incumbent upon us all to understand how our
[2:28:25.140 --> 2:28:28.300]  bodies work and to understand how to take care of our bodies and you know from
[2:28:28.300 --> 2:28:31.660]  listening to my program and from talking this weekend that I'm a big
[2:28:31.660 --> 2:28:35.700]  believer in nutritional supplementation you absolutely have to understand how to
[2:28:35.700 --> 2:28:39.660]  use nutritional supplements correctly you know Alex 62% of Americans use
[2:28:39.660 --> 2:28:43.300]  nutritional supplements but do you think of that 62% how many do you think
[2:28:43.300 --> 2:28:47.260]  really know how to use a nutritional supplement how to incorporate
[2:28:47.260 --> 2:28:50.700]  nutritional supplements in a synergistic fashion that and that's why I like
[2:28:50.700 --> 2:28:53.860]  nutritional supplements system so well we're gonna talk about that some
[2:28:53.860 --> 2:28:58.820]  solutions and just give some examples of what prescription drugs that are being
[2:28:58.820 --> 2:29:02.420]  pushed on us perfect example is the statin drugs that you were talking about
[2:29:02.420 --> 2:29:06.500]  that's a perfect example you do you know to this day there has not been one
[2:29:06.500 --> 2:29:10.740]  single definitive study that connects cholesterol to elevated blood cholesterol
[2:29:10.740 --> 2:29:14.620]  to atherosclerosis which is a leading cause of death the leading cause of death
[2:29:14.620 --> 2:29:18.500]  in this country to this day and it's not not for lack of searching for it yet if
[2:29:18.500 --> 2:29:21.740]  you go to the Midwest and you go back east you talk to people about cholesterol
[2:29:21.740 --> 2:29:26.060]  they most people still believe that their elevated cholesterol has to be
[2:29:26.060 --> 2:29:29.300]  stopped and has to be controlled to the point that they need to take poison
[2:29:29.300 --> 2:29:33.340]  prescription drugs to knock it down pharmacist Ben Fuchs stay there let's
[2:29:33.340 --> 2:29:36.860]  let's talk about some of the most deadly prescription drugs out there by the way

[2:33:08.420 --> 2:33:12.940]  the GCN radio network
[2:33:15.380 --> 2:33:20.180]  all right I will jam in some calls before this hour of transmission ends
[2:33:20.180 --> 2:33:23.660]  they'll be all over the map that Ben Fuchs you know had a chance to hang out
[2:33:23.660 --> 2:33:27.860]  with him in california when I was out there speaking his friends with ksco
[2:33:27.860 --> 2:33:33.260]  owner michael's whirling and also to hang out with him a couple days with
[2:33:33.260 --> 2:33:38.180]  rob do and Ted Anderson in New York and I'm really stunned by his breadth of
[2:33:38.180 --> 2:33:42.180]  knowledge he really does have a wide spectrum understanding we're gonna get
[2:33:42.180 --> 2:33:46.740]  into some of the most deadly prescription drugs versus good vitamins and
[2:33:46.740 --> 2:33:51.220]  minerals and by the way I'm teamed up with Ben Fuchs at info wars team.com
[2:33:51.220 --> 2:33:56.620]  he's our advisor we carry many of the products he's developed like pollen
[2:33:56.620 --> 2:34:01.220]  burst and going back six months ago I just stuck these in the house my wife
[2:34:01.220 --> 2:34:04.980]  likes nutritional stuff to see what she do and without me hyping and she came
[2:34:04.980 --> 2:34:08.620]  back so this is the best ever she's a lot more health-conscious than I am I'm
[2:34:08.620 --> 2:34:12.460]  so busy I'm trying to get more health-conscious if I dedicated all my
[2:34:12.460 --> 2:34:15.460]  time to it I could do it but but the point is I'm trying to get more into it
[2:34:15.460 --> 2:34:20.100]  and she loves the pollen burst she loves the beyond tangy tangerine these are
[2:34:20.100 --> 2:34:24.700]  full-spectrum vitamin mineral systems where you absorb a lot more of it than
[2:34:24.700 --> 2:34:30.220]  the you know toxic artificial forms of it that that big pharma puts on store
[2:34:30.220 --> 2:34:36.260]  shelves info wars team.com and we'll also punch that up on screen later and
[2:34:36.260 --> 2:34:38.500]  I'll give you the toll-free number to call if you've got any questions we've
[2:34:38.500 --> 2:34:41.780]  got great people there to answer your questions but I wanted to get to
[2:34:41.780 --> 2:34:45.980]  something else dealing with perception management and brainwashing and then get
[2:34:45.980 --> 2:34:51.500]  Ben Fuchs' take on it we always talk about how they're trying to dumb media
[2:34:51.500 --> 2:34:55.100]  down and in front line on PBS it's on a good report where they talk to the
[2:34:55.100 --> 2:34:59.380]  executives and it's admitted that going back decades ago a conscious decision
[2:34:59.380 --> 2:35:03.900]  more than decades ago but with TV they decided to lower the language use less
[2:35:03.900 --> 2:35:08.180]  words dumb it down and that it's not that the media is even giving people what
[2:35:08.180 --> 2:35:12.380]  they want the you know the old dominant media it's that they're force
[2:35:12.380 --> 2:35:18.140]  feeding it and people complain that there's not enough substance in politics
[2:35:18.140 --> 2:35:23.060]  it's about how their hair looks or do they go to NASCAR races or what team do
[2:35:23.060 --> 2:35:28.060]  they like and so it's all about likeability and that's always been the
[2:35:28.060 --> 2:35:32.380]  problem you want to go for the statesman or woman who actually stands for
[2:35:32.380 --> 2:35:37.180]  issues that you agree with and you're supposed to know the facts and I've
[2:35:37.180 --> 2:35:42.940]  watched debates since I've been watching them for 30 plus years degenerate I mean
[2:35:42.940 --> 2:35:53.020]  I watched Reagan in debates I watched George Herbert Walker Bush in debates I
[2:35:53.020 --> 2:35:56.340]  watched them all and they get more and more broken up whether or not debates
[2:35:56.340 --> 2:36:00.460]  it's just questions it's canned answers because they don't want the real issues
[2:36:00.460 --> 2:36:04.420]  injected now I'm not mad at Ron Paul but I don't know why he answered the
[2:36:04.420 --> 2:36:09.420]  question he paused he's not a smart mouth person but I don't think it would
[2:36:09.420 --> 2:36:12.580]  have been smart mouth he just said that's not an important question you know
[2:36:12.580 --> 2:36:16.540]  we've got a global depression but Ron Paul's a gentleman he answered the
[2:36:16.540 --> 2:36:21.700]  question they were saying what type of chicken do you like what type of hot
[2:36:21.700 --> 2:36:27.980]  wings what what's your favorite baseball team and it is so disgusting to see them
[2:36:27.980 --> 2:36:32.500]  in these already dumbed down debates more and more every election cycle they
[2:36:32.500 --> 2:36:37.220]  get worse and worse and if we put up with this and there's not a human cry
[2:36:37.220 --> 2:36:41.900]  against this they will spend the next two hour debate asking people cooking
[2:36:41.900 --> 2:36:47.100]  recipes and that's not what this is about it's not about giving PR people a way
[2:36:47.100 --> 2:36:50.540]  out to dumb things down have less knowledge that's why they've always
[2:36:50.540 --> 2:36:53.980]  hated having Ron Paul these debates because real issues get out there and
[2:36:53.980 --> 2:36:58.420]  we get real arguments going on so as things get worse and worse here they
[2:36:58.420 --> 2:37:02.100]  are trying to make it this pop garbage here's a clip of this I want to get
[2:37:02.100 --> 2:37:06.500]  Ben Fuchs's take this is of the debate last night it's in their personality so
[2:37:06.500 --> 2:37:09.780]  I'm going to borrow something from my sports fan experience every time we go
[2:37:09.780 --> 2:37:12.660]  to break or come back from break I'm going to ask the candidates one at a
[2:37:12.660 --> 2:37:17.100]  time a question I'll call this or that I give them a choice these are not serious
[2:37:17.100 --> 2:37:19.620]  political issues it's just to show a little bit of the personal side of our
[2:37:19.620 --> 2:37:25.140]  candidates Senator Santorum I want to start with you thank you of course
[2:37:25.140 --> 2:37:33.180]  Leno or Conan I'm neither probably Leno but I don't watch either sorry all right
[2:37:33.180 --> 2:37:35.420]  actually that's all right that's the answer the answer is the answer
[2:37:35.420 --> 2:37:41.220]  Congresswoman Bachman to you Elvis or Johnny Cash oh that's really tough that's
[2:37:41.220 --> 2:37:50.820]  really both both yeah both Christmas Elvis on my iPod all right now we know
[2:37:50.820 --> 2:37:55.260]  what's on the Congresswoman's iPod the speaker dancing with the stars or
[2:37:55.260 --> 2:37:58.380]  American Idol American Idol American Idol it is
[2:37:58.380 --> 2:38:01.540]  our candidates continue their debate in just a moment stay with us
[2:38:01.540 --> 2:38:06.300]  Congressman Paul Blackberry or iPhone
[2:38:06.300 --> 2:38:18.620]  Blackberry Blackberry it is Mr. Kane deep dish within crust deep dish deep dish
[2:38:18.620 --> 2:38:21.740]  it is a governor Romney to you now imagine you're getting to the barbecue
[2:38:21.740 --> 2:38:24.260]  joint maybe it's here in New Hampshire maybe it's South Carolina ordering some
[2:38:24.260 --> 2:38:33.580]  wings spicy or mild oh spicy absolutely and by the way Bruins are up 4-0
[2:38:34.620 --> 2:38:41.940]  I mean I mean ladies and gentlemen they want to make you love the politicians
[2:38:41.940 --> 2:38:45.740]  it's about government that has a 9% approval rating because you're aware
[2:38:45.740 --> 2:38:51.540]  of what their real policies are it's about government now making you like them
[2:38:51.540 --> 2:38:59.140]  because no real issues are discussed I mean this is pure propaganda and Romney
[2:38:59.140 --> 2:39:03.780]  goes one even further and obviously implies that during a break he was
[2:39:03.780 --> 2:39:10.300]  checking his iPhone to see where you know his favorite team was doing I mean
[2:39:10.300 --> 2:39:15.660]  this is evil Ben Fuchs they must be getting desperate you know if you didn't
[2:39:15.660 --> 2:39:20.220]  play that for me I would have thought it was some kind of joke and I didn't
[2:39:20.220 --> 2:39:22.740]  watch the debates for that very reason I didn't think it would stoop down that
[2:39:22.740 --> 2:39:28.660]  low but that has got to be that's got to be one of the most ridiculous statements
[2:39:28.660 --> 2:39:31.540]  on the on the American culture that I've ever heard in my life that is of
[2:39:31.540 --> 2:39:37.260]  absolutely absurd what you just played that is absolutely absurd I'm dumbfound
[2:39:37.260 --> 2:39:41.580]  I don't even know what to say but you know what folks it's up to us to raise the
[2:39:41.580 --> 2:39:45.820]  bar it's up to us to take the ball into our own if I'd have been there I would
[2:39:45.820 --> 2:39:52.660]  have said how dare you bring this up a bunch of little pap childish side
[2:39:52.660 --> 2:39:57.060]  issues we've got serious issues we've got our veterans having their health care
[2:39:57.060 --> 2:40:01.900]  cut we're going into a depression we've got now five wars going on now one in
[2:40:01.900 --> 2:40:06.100]  Yemen I'm not going to talk about my favorite pizza or what type of cell
[2:40:06.100 --> 2:40:09.540]  phone I got if I would have gotten the cell phone call I'd say I got one for
[2:40:09.540 --> 2:40:12.860]  emergencies but I try not to use it because it's giving people brain cancer
[2:40:12.860 --> 2:40:17.420]  and we need to be a serious country if there's a they want us obsessed with
[2:40:17.420 --> 2:40:22.140]  baloney so they can so they can engage in running the world they don't want us
[2:40:22.140 --> 2:40:26.940]  in the real world I'm sorry go ahead that isn't that's an absolute travesty
[2:40:26.940 --> 2:40:30.980]  what you just played and I agree I think I'm surprised Ron Paul didn't say
[2:40:30.980 --> 2:40:34.220]  something like I heard him kind of hesitate a little bit like he didn't
[2:40:34.220 --> 2:40:37.420]  believe he was going to be answering that question but I'll tell you what Alex
[2:40:37.420 --> 2:40:42.940]  he did look angry he did look angry but I mean he oh man I tell you that's it
[2:40:42.940 --> 2:40:46.140]  that's a tragic statement but just underscores the importance of us taking
[2:40:46.140 --> 2:40:48.980]  the ball into our own court and starting to do something about this I wonder
[2:40:48.980 --> 2:40:52.300]  what somebody's house is being foreclosed on and who's been out of work for six
[2:40:52.300 --> 2:40:56.340]  months would think about whether Mitt Romney likes thin cruster or thick
[2:40:56.340 --> 2:41:00.300]  crust Jesus that's amazing that's amazing yeah I've got to get the whole
[2:41:00.300 --> 2:41:04.140]  debate and actually boil down because it went on for like ten minutes oh that's
[2:41:04.140 --> 2:41:07.980]  another issue burning up time you got a what an hour and a half debate and for
[2:41:07.980 --> 2:41:11.540]  ten minutes I went and found it this morning the whole thing and skipped it
[2:41:11.540 --> 2:41:16.020]  I mean they went for like a whole segment into the next segment and we're
[2:41:16.020 --> 2:41:20.900]  asking them all pizza what's yours what's yours what's yours I mean oh my I
[2:41:20.900 --> 2:41:27.340]  mean no one in history would have act like this no one I mean can you imagine
[2:41:27.340 --> 2:41:31.500]  if they asked George Washington in a presidential debate what's your favorite
[2:41:31.500 --> 2:41:36.620]  bird dog he would have said my dear sir we have more important things to do
[2:41:36.620 --> 2:41:42.020]  presently I mean it's incredible how they turn us into children folks you're
[2:41:42.020 --> 2:41:45.420]  not supposed to act like you're six years old for your whole life I'm sorry I
[2:41:45.420 --> 2:41:49.420]  mean I see adults I listen to conversation they're all like a bunch of
[2:41:49.420 --> 2:41:53.940]  children man well to what extent are we culpable for questions like that to what
[2:41:53.940 --> 2:41:57.860]  extent are we complicit that they that they think it's okay to present that
[2:41:57.860 --> 2:42:02.140]  kind of message at a presidential debate which I don't even know how they
[2:42:02.140 --> 2:42:05.180]  call it a debate well then listen I've been ranting here and I want to go to
[2:42:05.180 --> 2:42:09.060]  some calls break down quickly some of the most deadly drugs out there what
[2:42:09.060 --> 2:42:13.980]  they're really doing versus truly high quality vitamins and minerals and the
[2:42:13.980 --> 2:42:18.860]  type of incredible results you've seen for some of the mainstay chronic
[2:42:18.860 --> 2:42:23.300]  illnesses that are becoming so commonplace the number one and it's tough
[2:42:23.300 --> 2:42:25.980]  to say the number one class of toxic drugs because they're all pretty darn
[2:42:25.980 --> 2:42:29.220]  toxic but the ones that stand out for me are the high blood pressure drugs the
[2:42:29.220 --> 2:42:33.140]  so-called anti-hypertensives and there's two reasons for that number one they
[2:42:33.140 --> 2:42:38.180]  are a powerful powerful poisons of the of the set of the nervous system so called
[2:42:38.180 --> 2:42:42.140]  beta blockers and calcium channel blockers that people get put on almost
[2:42:42.140 --> 2:42:45.220]  automatically when they have high blood pressure you see these beta blockers and
[2:42:45.220 --> 2:42:48.620]  calcium channel blockers block everything and folks if you hear the word
[2:42:48.620 --> 2:42:52.860]  blocker in terms of your prescription drug that's a prescription drug you don't
[2:42:52.860 --> 2:42:57.020]  want to take because you can't just block one system a beta blocker blocks the
[2:42:57.020 --> 2:43:01.500]  entire beta nervous system which is one half of your nervous system and you're
[2:43:01.500 --> 2:43:05.900]  playing with fire if you use it and the reason why I'm so up up in arms about
[2:43:05.900 --> 2:43:09.900]  these anti-hypertensives is only one half because they're toxic but the other
[2:43:09.900 --> 2:43:13.700]  half is because they're so unnecessary dropping your blood pressure is one of
[2:43:13.700 --> 2:43:18.980]  the easiest things to do dropping your blood pressure simply by taking in
[2:43:18.980 --> 2:43:22.940]  supplements that open up blood vessels such as niacin in the B complex
[2:43:22.940 --> 2:43:27.740]  electrolytes like magnesium and potassium and most importantly folks the single
[2:43:27.740 --> 2:43:31.260]  most important thing you could do for your health and longevity drop your
[2:43:31.260 --> 2:43:35.820]  insulin make your body more sensitive to insulin lower your blood sugar your
[2:43:35.820 --> 2:43:39.420]  blood pressure will drop so fast that you'll have to get off your prescription
[2:43:39.420 --> 2:43:44.700]  drug or it will drop but they can't sell you exercising eating healthy and not
[2:43:44.700 --> 2:43:48.900]  drinking as much sugar eating as much sugar they'd rather let you continue to
[2:43:48.900 --> 2:43:52.500]  be sick and then use something that blocks it that takes care of that but
[2:43:52.500 --> 2:43:57.060]  causes a whole other panopticon of other problems because they got drugs to sell
[2:43:57.060 --> 2:44:01.220]  you on that front if you want to drop your blood pressure you and you should
[2:44:01.220 --> 2:44:04.300]  drop your blood pressure and if you want to do it you do not need prescription
[2:44:04.300 --> 2:44:08.540]  drugs to do it and it's one of the simplest easiest nutritional nutritional
[2:44:08.540 --> 2:44:12.540]  strategies that you can effects from nutritional strategies that you can
[2:44:12.540 --> 2:44:16.220]  ever achieve dropping your insulin making your body more sensitive to insulin
[2:44:16.220 --> 2:44:19.500]  dropping your blood sugar taking the B complex and electrolytes and your blood
[2:44:19.500 --> 2:44:22.540]  pressure will drop like a stone and you'll lose weight on top of that as
[2:44:22.540 --> 2:44:25.700]  well the second thing a second class of drugs that troubles me are these
[2:44:25.700 --> 2:44:30.340]  anti-convulsant drugs that they use for bipolar disorder and for emotional
[2:44:30.340 --> 2:44:34.780]  problems and any pharmacist will tell you that tegratol and depicote and
[2:44:34.780 --> 2:44:38.620]  and valproic acid and dilatin these drugs they use for they used to use them
[2:44:38.620 --> 2:44:42.700]  just as anti-convulsants now they're using them for anxiety and for bipolar
[2:44:42.700 --> 2:44:46.180]  disorder those are among the most deadly drugs of all and you need to have your
[2:44:46.180 --> 2:44:49.340]  liver checked every six months when you're on them and by the way if you're
[2:44:49.340 --> 2:44:52.780]  on a drug like the statin drugs that requires that you need to have your
[2:44:52.780 --> 2:44:56.860]  liver checked every six months that's telling you that you are playing with a
[2:44:56.860 --> 2:44:59.940]  deadly drug and let me tell you something folks they make a scene like
[2:44:59.940 --> 2:45:03.300]  those statin drugs are like M&Ms or like candy and there's no problem and we
[2:45:03.300 --> 2:45:05.740]  can give them to children we should put them in the water and they should be
[2:45:05.740 --> 2:45:09.820]  over the counter and that is far from being true they're so toxic these statin
[2:45:09.820 --> 2:45:13.580]  drugs that liver enzymes are elevated in one out of a hundred people who take
[2:45:13.580 --> 2:45:18.540]  them and even more than that are subject to liver toxicity that don't show up
[2:45:18.540 --> 2:45:25.340]  with live by the way elevated liver levels that that's a fancy way of saying
[2:45:25.340 --> 2:45:30.380]  your liver is leaking their cells dying it's swelling up like you're drinking a
[2:45:30.380 --> 2:45:33.540]  quart of Jack Daniels every day that's right and you know today we have a new
[2:45:33.540 --> 2:45:38.180]  disease called non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and that's the same disease you
[2:45:38.180 --> 2:45:41.620]  used to have to drink a pint a day to get now everybody's getting it so they
[2:45:41.620 --> 2:45:46.380]  call it non-alcoholic fatty liver disease or NAFLD and they say well and now we
[2:45:46.380 --> 2:45:52.620]  have now we have early onset of brain degenerative disorders and oh now young
[2:45:52.620 --> 2:45:56.940]  people are getting Alzheimer's drink more aspartame drink more out of aluminum
[2:45:56.940 --> 2:46:01.180]  cans and they had studies 30 years ago in rodents with aluminum that that that
[2:46:01.180 --> 2:46:07.260]  they had their brains rot I mean they know what they're doing you don't want
[2:46:07.260 --> 2:46:10.900]  to touch aspartame folks in fact as terrible as sugar is it's probably
[2:46:10.900 --> 2:46:15.520]  better than aspartame at least your body has has evolved metabolic systems to
[2:46:15.520 --> 2:46:20.020]  take care of sugar and by the way the sweet taste alone is problematic so
[2:46:20.020 --> 2:46:24.700]  whether it's a sweetener is artificial or sweetener is non artificial just that
[2:46:24.700 --> 2:46:28.380]  sweet taste alone initiates an insulin response and as I say if you have to
[2:46:28.380 --> 2:46:31.940]  pick one system that you want to regulate in order to maintain your health
[2:46:31.940 --> 2:46:36.180]  and longevity it's that blood sugar and insulin system now I want to go to some

[2:48:16.100 --> 2:48:19.620]  Ben Fuchs what are some of the best products in your opinion obviously you
[2:48:19.620 --> 2:48:23.020]  designed one of them pollen burst but that's separately so I wanted to get a
[2:48:23.020 --> 2:48:27.140]  whole to use because that's my wife's favorite and Doc Wallach and others say
[2:48:27.140 --> 2:48:30.340]  it's the best out there with that B complex and other things but tell me
[2:48:30.340 --> 2:48:33.860]  about those three products well I love the pollen burst and I wish I designed
[2:48:33.860 --> 2:48:37.620]  it because it's a wonderful product I heard you designed it I know that credit
[2:48:37.620 --> 2:48:41.140]  goes to Dr. Corey Gold is a good friend is Corey Gold I get confused I get
[2:48:41.140 --> 2:48:44.580]  confused that's right I didn't want last week see I'm not perfect folks I forget
[2:48:44.580 --> 2:48:49.220]  stuff go ahead Corey's a dear friend of mine gold mixed up go ahead that's okay
[2:48:49.220 --> 2:48:52.580]  but I love the pollen burst and I wish I designed it because I take it myself no
[2:48:52.580 --> 2:48:56.580]  my favorite I got a few favorite product you're the skin guy to I am the skin
[2:48:56.580 --> 2:49:00.060]  guy yeah my favorite product and by the way the skin no matter what your skin
[2:49:00.060 --> 2:49:03.740]  issue is folks and skin is very troubling Alex because we can see the skin you
[2:49:03.740 --> 2:49:06.340]  know our blood pressure is more important than our skin but we can see the
[2:49:06.340 --> 2:49:09.580]  skin so people tend to be more concerned about skin issues and other things and
[2:49:09.580 --> 2:49:12.860]  folks if you have a skin disease rest assured you got something going on
[2:49:12.860 --> 2:49:16.020]  inside your body as well because you don't have psoriasis and you don't have
[2:49:16.020 --> 2:49:19.500]  acne you don't have eczema unless your body's breaking down inside as well and
[2:49:19.500 --> 2:49:22.780]  the good news is is when your eczema clears up the inside of your body is
[2:49:22.780 --> 2:49:26.220]  healing too so that's one of the neat things about the skin also with the skin
[2:49:26.220 --> 2:49:29.300]  the skin tends to heal very rapidly that's one of the reasons why I like
[2:49:29.300 --> 2:49:32.860]  these liquid nutrients and to answer your question Alex the beyond tangy
[2:49:32.860 --> 2:49:36.740]  tangerine is by far my most my favorite product of all the young Jeffy
[2:49:36.740 --> 2:49:39.660]  there's a quite a few that I like but the beyond tangy tangerine is my favorite
[2:49:39.660 --> 2:49:43.180]  because it gives you all of the basic nutrients that you need in generous
[2:49:43.180 --> 2:49:47.300]  amounts especially vitamin C and it does it in a tasty fashion and I hear all
[2:49:47.300 --> 2:49:50.620]  the time from folks who aren't big on nutritional supplementation they don't
[2:49:50.620 --> 2:49:53.700]  feel like doing it or it's a pain to take pills or they don't like the taste
[2:49:53.700 --> 2:49:57.020]  thing about the beyond tangy tangerine it's like drinking Kool-Aid it's like
[2:49:57.020 --> 2:50:01.260]  drinking a refreshing beverage you keep it in the refrigerator you make it
[2:50:01.260 --> 2:50:04.340]  fresh in the morning keep it in the refrigerator and it's refreshing kids
[2:50:04.340 --> 2:50:08.580]  love it and it's loaded with nutrients in a liquid fashion and that's another
[2:50:08.580 --> 2:50:13.620]  very important point about health the less work your digestive system does the
[2:50:13.620 --> 2:50:17.660]  longer you will live in fact every study that's ever been done on longevity
[2:50:17.660 --> 2:50:23.620]  shows that when you lower your caloric intake intake you live long that's how
[2:50:23.620 --> 2:50:28.500]  they that's how they make rats I've seen the rat studies for decades where they
[2:50:28.500 --> 2:50:32.620]  feed rats double of the same thing and the rats that get double live almost
[2:50:32.620 --> 2:50:36.940]  half as long and then they really cut rats into high high nutrient but very
[2:50:36.940 --> 2:50:40.860]  low caloric intake the rats can live two three four times as long they've done
[2:50:40.860 --> 2:50:44.500]  it with worms and things I want to come back and explain to me why that's the
[2:50:44.500 --> 2:50:48.220]  case because I went out to dinner with you several times and you don't look
[2:50:48.220 --> 2:50:52.780]  skinny you look healthy but you didn't ever eat you were there drinking the
[2:50:52.780 --> 2:50:57.540]  pollen burst and the tangy tangerine and you said you weren't hungry and you're
[2:50:57.540 --> 2:51:00.620]  gonna end up living a long time and I eat like a pig I'm gonna end up dying

[2:54:27.700 --> 2:54:33.820]  flip people and and names it's dr. Cory gold that was just on last week with us
[2:54:33.820 --> 2:54:39.260]  and who formulated pollen burst that we sell at info wars team dot com that my
[2:54:39.260 --> 2:54:43.260]  wife loved so much a while was saying pharmacist Ben Fuchs had made it I think
[2:54:43.260 --> 2:54:49.140]  even this weekend I was mindlessly going that's good pollen burst you made my
[2:54:49.140 --> 2:54:52.380]  memories great but sometimes it does crazy things but I think all of your
[2:54:52.380 --> 2:54:56.340]  memories do that as well I want to go to a few calls here but how important is
[2:54:56.340 --> 2:55:00.980]  detoxing the body with the detox pack that young Jevity has at info wars
[2:55:00.980 --> 2:55:06.500]  team calm pharmacist Ben Fuchs if you got toxicity going on you're gonna need
[2:55:06.500 --> 2:55:10.300]  some help because no matter what you put inside your body if you're clogged up
[2:55:10.300 --> 2:55:13.620]  and your liver is overloaded it's not you're not going to be able to maximize
[2:55:13.620 --> 2:55:16.820]  the results that you get from nutritional supplementation so the detox
[2:55:16.820 --> 2:55:20.540]  formula is very important making sure that you're not putting poisons in in
[2:55:20.540 --> 2:55:23.620]  the first place is also important and then making sure that you're getting the
[2:55:23.620 --> 2:55:27.500]  micronutrients that support your body's own detoxification system of course you
[2:55:27.500 --> 2:55:31.420]  have a enzyme system in your liver called the glutathione system and the
[2:55:31.420 --> 2:55:36.860]  glutathione system is so unbelievably powerful it's able to handle detox
[2:55:36.860 --> 2:55:42.100]  detoxify your body from radiation protect you from bacterial toxicity
[2:55:42.100 --> 2:55:46.340]  like that E. coli epidemic that's going on over there in Europe the glutathione
[2:55:46.340 --> 2:55:50.260]  system can handle cancer the glutathione system is responsible for protecting
[2:55:50.260 --> 2:55:55.220]  your body from environmental assault the key is to build up your body's own
[2:55:55.220 --> 2:55:59.700]  detoxifying system so in addition to detoxifying programs making sure you're
[2:55:59.700 --> 2:56:02.780]  getting vitamin C making sure you're getting a high quality protein well
[2:56:02.780 --> 2:56:07.620]  here's an example liquid nutrients yeah pharmacist Ben Fuchs here's an example
[2:56:07.620 --> 2:56:12.500]  I'm so busy we're all so busy a lot of us know this information but people tell
[2:56:12.500 --> 2:56:16.660]  us just six months ago jaren one of the producers started having really bad
[2:56:16.660 --> 2:56:19.700]  allergies we had him the whole time I knew him like I did he started taking
[2:56:19.700 --> 2:56:23.500]  probiotics because most of our intestines you know the food so dead don't
[2:56:23.500 --> 2:56:28.380]  have the good bacteria no allergies doesn't get sick anymore so I started
[2:56:28.380 --> 2:56:31.900]  taking him three months ago just you know bought the complex ones and suddenly
[2:56:31.900 --> 2:56:37.140]  my allergies are gone I mean it worked like a charm because what you've said
[2:56:37.140 --> 2:56:41.060]  and and many other medical doctors I've had on they say allergies in the whole
[2:56:41.060 --> 2:56:45.620]  body are driven by the intestines that's right let me tell you something if
[2:56:45.620 --> 2:56:49.020]  people saw what was going on there in in their intestines after they had a
[2:56:49.020 --> 2:56:53.140]  regular meal they would need a regular meal any longer the intestinal system is
[2:56:53.140 --> 2:56:56.900]  the key to health when human beings are born they're born premature because we
[2:56:56.900 --> 2:57:00.260]  have big heads so we come out of the womb early that premature that
[2:57:00.260 --> 2:57:03.340]  prematurity the fact that we come out early means that our digestive system
[2:57:03.340 --> 2:57:07.140]  and our immune system which are the same system people 80% of your immune
[2:57:07.140 --> 2:57:11.380]  system is in your digestive system both those systems are born premature and we
[2:57:11.380 --> 2:57:14.940]  depend on breast milk for the development of the digestive system slash
[2:57:14.940 --> 2:57:18.340]  immune system if we're not getting breastfed or if we're not getting breast
[2:57:18.340 --> 2:57:21.620]  fed long enough or if our moms are under-nutriated which pretty much covers
[2:57:21.620 --> 2:57:26.620]  all of us we become compromised at the intestinal level from birth forward what
[2:57:26.620 --> 2:57:30.660]  about babies that are given formula that are half corn syrup and sugar I mean no
[2:57:30.660 --> 2:57:34.060]  wonder a lot of these kids look like zombies I'm telling you that if you
[2:57:34.060 --> 2:57:37.980]  want to make sure that your kid suffers from allergies for the rest of his life
[2:57:37.980 --> 2:57:42.460]  or suffers from autoimmune disease for the rest of his life you put them on a
[2:57:42.460 --> 2:57:46.260]  formula and that's one of the best ways to assure that your kid is going to have
[2:57:46.260 --> 2:57:51.100]  a short life when a kid is born he needs your baby he or she needs to have
[2:57:51.100 --> 2:57:55.620]  number one breast milk you're a conspiracy theorist it's a lie women
[2:57:55.620 --> 2:57:59.220]  never breastfed I can see in the future they'll be like arrest that man he
[2:57:59.220 --> 2:58:02.940]  claims that women had breasts to breastfeed he's without kyda he's an
[2:58:02.940 --> 2:58:07.060]  extremist you know pharmacist Ben Fuchs you're a weirdo man you're on my show
[2:58:07.060 --> 2:58:13.020]  saying women and mammals had breasts to feed young you are an extremist I hate
[2:58:13.020 --> 2:58:16.620]  to say but what you said is very very important Alex probiotics are like a
[2:58:16.620 --> 2:58:20.260]  miracle I put my mom on him she got off her heartburn medicine in a week she
[2:58:20.260 --> 2:58:23.900]  couldn't get off it for years and she said that those exact words it's a
[2:58:23.900 --> 2:58:28.060]  miracle that's what my mom told me well it's all available info wars team at
