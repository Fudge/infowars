[00:00.000 --> 00:08.840]  media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN
[00:08.840 --> 00:14.840]  radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:14.840 --> 00:29.840]  We're live, my friends. I am chomping at the bit to expose the ongoing criminal activities
[00:29.840 --> 00:37.760]  of the global crime system known as the New World Order. Welcome. It is the 12th day of
[00:37.760 --> 00:43.560]  May, 2008. We're going to be live here for the next four hours, Monday through Friday,
[00:43.560 --> 00:56.400]  11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central Standard Time. Retransmit on the network from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m. We have
[00:56.400 --> 01:08.520]  a ton of vital information that we're going to be covering today for you. Let me go ahead
[01:08.520 --> 01:14.520]  and just launch into some of it that I have here in front of me. First off, I got a call
[01:14.520 --> 01:22.240]  yesterday by an individual living in East Texas whose friend is a young associate pastor
[01:22.240 --> 01:29.480]  and is about to graduate with his, I guess, doctorate from a local Bible college. And
[01:29.480 --> 01:40.680]  they had a group of Boy Scouts come in to the office into the college. And when they
[01:40.680 --> 01:46.240]  came in to the school, he didn't even give them an anti-New World Order speech. He just
[01:46.240 --> 01:51.440]  taught them Declaration of Independence, Bill of Rights, Constitution just gave a speech
[01:51.440 --> 01:56.520]  on the subject. And one of the people that brought the students in recorded it being
[01:56.520 --> 02:01.120]  Homeland Security trained, knowing that you don't talk about the Bill of Rights, Constitution,
[02:01.120 --> 02:05.920]  Declaration of Independence. We have Homeland Security training videos, FEMA training videos
[02:05.920 --> 02:12.000]  where they say that that's illegal and unlawful and not to be discussed in a terrorist document.
[02:12.000 --> 02:19.000]  By the way, this is not Monty Python satire. This is not a joke. This is not a game. This
[02:19.000 --> 02:25.280]  is not a drill. We've been documenting this since before 9-11. And so the person recorded
[02:25.280 --> 02:31.720]  him saying this and Homeland Security was waiting for him with the head of the school
[02:31.720 --> 02:36.280]  and the guy was in a black suit wearing sunglasses and said, you could be arrested for inciting
[02:36.280 --> 02:43.720]  terrorism. Now the individual, I don't want to say is scared to come on, but says they
[02:43.720 --> 02:47.240]  don't want to give the school a bad name. And they just want to have the mission of
[02:47.240 --> 02:52.560]  saving souls. But they admit that, well, if they don't go on air, this is a great tyranny
[02:52.560 --> 02:56.880]  to the country and that we won't even have any freedom in this nation, much less First
[02:56.880 --> 03:00.600]  Amendment religious freedom. Those types of stuff continues. Now, now I have training
[03:00.600 --> 03:05.360]  manuals. I have government documents. I have video of this and we're going to write a story
[03:05.360 --> 03:10.840]  and post all of this. We also know that 26,000 preachers have been recruited to train their
[03:10.840 --> 03:17.200]  flocks to hand in their guns, go to FEMA camps, let their families be broken up, go to work,
[03:17.200 --> 03:21.600]  labor facilities. I told you this, of course, a year and a half before, gave you secret
[03:21.600 --> 03:28.800]  documents and now it's on the news. I mean, just think of the magnitude of this and how
[03:28.800 --> 03:36.600]  on its face it is hyper classical tyranny out of Soviet Russia or Nazi Germany. I mean,
[03:36.600 --> 03:43.880]  this is so off the charts that it's so amazing that it's going on, but I will have one of
[03:43.880 --> 03:57.680]  the individuals on the show, maybe both coming up in about 25 minutes. So that will be coming
[03:57.680 --> 04:03.520]  up today. Now, to understand the police and military and all government minions, they
[04:03.520 --> 04:07.840]  swear an oath to protect, defend, uphold the constitution against all enemies, foreign
[04:07.840 --> 04:18.680]  and domestic, but I have FEMA on video teaching police in, of course, Kansas City. I was also
[04:18.680 --> 04:25.680]  shown video of it being done in Austin, Texas at an event that was six years ago. The folks
[04:25.680 --> 04:29.480]  that showed me the video at the time agree with Homeland Security and wouldn't let me
[04:29.480 --> 04:33.160]  use it. Now they've kind of woken up. I need to call them back and see if they'll let me
[04:33.160 --> 04:38.120]  use the video now. But what's even the point? Yeah, they said, yeah, you can watch the video,
[04:38.120 --> 04:44.760]  but you can't play the video saying that I forgot. I need to call them and get that
[04:44.760 --> 04:49.560]  video. I think now they've woken up. They realize it's not good. We'll be right back.
[04:49.560 --> 04:50.560]  Stay with us.
[04:50.560 --> 05:03.720]  It is a big idea. A new world order. In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful
[05:03.720 --> 05:09.160]  world government. It's known as the builder bird. Both their objective being world domination.
[05:09.160 --> 05:14.560]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the new world
[05:14.560 --> 05:23.160]  order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand. For the first
[05:23.160 --> 05:28.560]  time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open. You will learn
[05:28.560 --> 05:32.960]  the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda. Build America is making great
[05:32.960 --> 05:36.520]  progress toward a world economy. Most people have no idea they're not after money. They
[05:36.520 --> 05:40.240]  have all the money they need. They're after power. Yes, they're after easier. Order in

[06:53.160 --> 07:01.360]  We're already under a scientific dictatorship. Martial law is coming, but it's not going
[07:01.360 --> 07:06.720]  to arrive overnight. It's going to be incremental. This country is already teetering on the edge.
[07:06.720 --> 07:10.640]  Any incidents small or large could trigger a total takeover. Anything could be the final

[07:26.240 --> 07:29.880]  announced, checkpoints will be enforced, gun confiscations will occur for registered gun

[07:46.080 --> 08:11.080]  Everybody knows that the days are loaded. Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed.
[08:11.080 --> 08:22.520]  Everybody knows the war is over. Everybody knows the good guy's lost. Everybody knows
[08:22.520 --> 08:31.160]  the fight was fixed. The poor stay poor. The rich get a nice sense how it goes. I just
[08:31.160 --> 08:46.680]  had to talk to a young associate pastor in East Texas. We'll just cover when the song
[08:46.680 --> 09:02.160]  is over. Everybody got this broken feeling. Like their father or their dog just died. Everybody
[09:02.160 --> 09:17.560]  wants a box of chocolate and a long stem rose. Everybody knows. Everybody knows that you
[09:17.560 --> 09:28.560]  love me baby. Everybody knows that you really do. Everybody knows that you've been faithful.
[09:28.560 --> 09:38.560]  Everybody knows. Give or take a night or two. Everybody knows you've been discreet but there
[09:38.560 --> 09:53.560]  were so many people you just had to meet without your clothes. And everybody knows. Everybody
[09:53.560 --> 10:00.560]  knows.
[10:00.560 --> 10:13.360]  I had to stifle smashing the microphone and computer in my studio about 20 seconds ago.
[10:13.360 --> 10:19.800]  That's how serious this is. That's how life and death this is. That's how far gone this
[10:19.800 --> 10:26.520]  country is. That's how cowed we are. That's how we're going into a scientific dictatorship
[10:26.520 --> 10:34.200]  where they're incrementally putting the shackles on tighter every minute.
[10:34.200 --> 10:39.080]  I was talking to the young pastor who's finishing getting his degree at a major Bible school
[10:39.080 --> 10:46.320]  in East Texas. His theology degree. Having to beg him and convince him to come on the
[10:46.320 --> 10:54.840]  show. And I know he's listening right now along with his friend who called me. And of
[10:54.840 --> 11:00.480]  course he is saying well we do have these outreach programs to communist China and so
[11:00.480 --> 11:04.720]  I don't want to hurt the school's name and hurt what we're doing and hurt the missionary
[11:04.720 --> 11:09.080]  programs. And I said sir we're going to be the equivalent of communist China or Nazi
[11:09.080 --> 11:15.040]  Germany if we don't end this now. I mean that's the point is this country so far gone that
[11:15.040 --> 11:19.640]  the best of the best of who we are. I mean because most people don't even have the courage
[11:19.640 --> 11:28.400]  to call me are afraid to go on air and talk about how Homeland Security comes to them
[11:28.400 --> 11:34.160]  and says you are not to teach the Bill of Rights to people. That is a terrorist document
[11:34.160 --> 11:41.320]  leading the Bill of Rights is incitement to terrorism.
[11:41.320 --> 11:48.600]  Just how bad all of this is. That's how screwed up all of this is. That's how far we've fallen.
[11:48.600 --> 11:54.200]  How far we've gone. Now I'm going to say it again for everybody out there. I know we've
[11:54.200 --> 11:59.520]  talked about this a lot but we have video in road to tyranny that a Kansas City firefighter
[11:59.520 --> 12:06.960]  shot of FEMA teaching a room of police deputies and firemen that the founding fathers are
[12:06.960 --> 12:15.320]  bad terrorist and that the founding fathers were bad. But that isn't even where it begins.
[12:15.320 --> 12:21.520]  I have, this is from Bill Clinton, call a member of the Phoenix FBI terrorism task force
[12:21.520 --> 12:32.960]  investigator Al Shearer Maricopa County Attorney's Office 602-650-3131 Federal Bureau of Investigation
[12:32.960 --> 12:40.760]  602-650-3163 Analyst Terry Chapman Maricopa County Sheriff's Office. This is how they
[12:40.760 --> 12:45.360]  analyze this and it says if you encounter any of the following called the Joint Terrorism
[12:45.360 --> 12:51.920]  Task Force Federal Bureau of Investigation 201 East Indianola Avenue Phoenix, Arizona
[12:51.920 --> 13:03.880]  85012 and this is from 1999 and it says call the FBI if you identify any of these terror
[13:03.880 --> 13:09.200]  groups. Anyone who quote says they are defenders of the US Constitution against federal government
[13:09.200 --> 13:15.400]  and quote UN troops. Groups of individuals engaging in paramilitary training, common
[13:15.400 --> 13:22.400]  law movement proponents and it goes on to say no driver's license, refuse identify self,
[13:22.400 --> 13:26.480]  request authority for stop. See you talk to the cop, you get tasered. Make numerous references
[13:26.480 --> 13:31.240]  to the US Constitution. Claim driving is a right not a privilege. Attempt to police
[13:31.240 --> 13:38.720]  the police, yeah how dare citizens be involved. It goes on to say second amendment organization,
[13:38.720 --> 13:45.760]  second amendment rights groups, land rights groups. You understand and there are neocon
[13:45.760 --> 13:52.760]  organizations that will say that this flyer isn't even real when it was in Washington
[13:52.760 --> 13:57.880]  Times reported on it. The Associated Press reported on it at the time it was out. But
[13:57.880 --> 14:04.440]  I've got FEMA on video saying worse stuff. Do you understand that they have 26,000 preachers
[14:04.440 --> 14:10.180]  and they're doubling their number in 2008 who are giving and we now see it on national
[14:10.180 --> 14:14.440]  television with the preacher programs on TBN. We see the local preacher shows all over
[14:14.440 --> 14:19.360]  the country. They all for their egomania have their local TV show where they sit there and
[14:19.360 --> 14:25.240]  beg for money. And they say being a slave to government is good. Handing in your guns
[14:25.240 --> 14:31.360]  is good. Do whatever they say. I mean it is just absolutely sick. They are government
[14:31.360 --> 14:38.520]  stooges. Total violation of the first amendment. So of course they teach that Congress shall
[14:38.520 --> 14:43.000]  make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise
[14:43.000 --> 14:51.800]  thereof. And during the last break I had to beg the guest to keep his guts together and
[14:51.800 --> 14:55.560]  to come on the show but I said we'll leave it up to you whether you're going to say
[14:55.560 --> 15:06.960]  your name and the name of the East Texas school, the name of the college. Now I have
[15:06.960 --> 15:13.280]  the documents. I have the video. I have the news articles. We have the secret FEMA training
[15:13.280 --> 15:18.320]  for the pastors a year and a half before it happened and we had pastors on who then had
[15:18.320 --> 15:22.280]  Homeland Security come to their offices and say how dare you talk about the secret program
[15:22.280 --> 15:27.440]  and kick them out of it when they recruited them in the first place. Then it came out
[15:27.440 --> 15:33.240]  in the news. Do you read me? This is happening. And in case you don't know history when you've
[15:33.240 --> 15:39.880]  got secret police liaisoning and co-opting your local police, your local mayors, your
[15:39.880 --> 15:46.480]  local leaders, your local preachers, it doesn't get any worse and anti-freedom and pro-territy
[15:46.480 --> 15:52.000]  than that. I mean that is the most, they're building camps. Do you understand? They're
[15:52.000 --> 15:58.240]  building FEMA camps. They're building camps. They're massing millions of police and riot
[15:58.240 --> 16:04.440]  police. This is not for al-Qaeda, even if you believe it exists. The entire system is
[16:04.440 --> 16:11.080]  designed for you, those that have licked their boots, those of you that have toted them.
[16:11.080 --> 16:15.160]  You understand this is a criminal group moving against you and they use the smoke screen
[16:15.160 --> 16:21.560]  of the terror they staged to do it. The United States is not about a young pastor who's
[16:21.560 --> 16:28.000]  finishing his doctorate at a school, who's an associate pastor, a pastor, a lower level
[16:28.000 --> 16:35.640]  pastor at his church. This is not, freedom is not teaching Cub Scouts about the Bill
[16:35.640 --> 16:41.200]  of Rights. See yesterday when I first heard about this, I thought he was giving them a
[16:41.200 --> 16:46.280]  truly super patriotic message. No, no, no, it turns out now learning more details, he
[16:46.280 --> 16:52.280]  just taught them what he learned when he was a Boy Scout about, you know, protect the freedoms,
[16:52.280 --> 16:58.160]  liberties, Bill of Rights constitution, what they taught when I was in Cub Scouts. Not
[16:58.160 --> 17:02.600]  anymore folks and it was recorded. See the issue is, is that there were adults there.
[17:02.600 --> 17:06.400]  There was the scout leader there. There were some parents there and they had been given
[17:06.400 --> 17:11.120]  the FBI training all over the nation. They send out flyers saying, please come to local
[17:11.120 --> 17:15.800]  community center. We're going to have an anti-terror training seminar. We want community volunteers
[17:15.800 --> 17:19.600]  and people hear that and they think it's interesting and they go to it and then when once they
[17:19.600 --> 17:24.880]  get there they learn, okay, we're going to fight terror and all crime. Spy on your neighbor.
[17:24.880 --> 17:31.440]  Are they dumping motor oil in their backyard? Do they spank their children? Do you smell
[17:31.440 --> 17:39.120]  marijuana? And by the way, constitutional patriots, they talk about the Bill of Rights.
[17:39.120 --> 17:45.960]  That's terrorist code. That's exactly what happened here. Do you understand? The, in
[17:45.960 --> 17:53.200]  the United States talking about the constitution gets Homeland Security after you. Now it's
[17:53.200 --> 17:58.200]  all intimidation. The criminals doing this at Homeland Security know that they're terrorist.
[17:58.200 --> 18:02.320]  They know what they're doing. They know they're there to intimidate and shut down freedom
[18:02.320 --> 18:06.640]  and liberty. They know and they're there to intimidate you and they count on you being
[18:06.640 --> 18:12.440]  quiet and they count on you not speaking out. I mean, this is case closed. The government
[18:12.440 --> 18:21.000]  is teaching the police, the preachers, the citizens that the Bill of Rights is illegal.
[18:21.000 --> 18:24.400]  Now again, I've seen hundreds of cases of this, but I'll use the one that affects, you
[18:24.400 --> 18:28.200]  know, that happened to one of our people, Kelly rushing, upstanding, no criminal record,
[18:28.200 --> 18:36.640]  Ryan County, Kentucky, gives a police officer a videotape with Ron Paul video, neocon speech
[18:36.640 --> 18:42.800]  he gave. That's the title of the speech, 47 minutes long, and then rode to tyranny.
[18:42.800 --> 18:47.400]  And it's so freaked out. It had, he had such a crisis of conscious, conscience that the
[18:47.400 --> 18:53.480]  state police officer saw FEMA saying the constitution's evil. America's bad. The founding fathers,
[18:53.480 --> 18:59.680]  George Washington is bad. It's all the videos on there. Abby Newman being arrested in Virginia
[18:59.680 --> 19:05.040]  at a checkpoint for, for having a pocket constitution. The state troopers saying the constitution's
[19:05.040 --> 19:10.400]  illegal all on video. See, we don't just have the training. We have it happening from the
[19:10.400 --> 19:16.320]  squad car video that he had a mental illness flip out. He had to go ahead and say, yes,
[19:16.320 --> 19:21.280]  it is terrorism. And then they arrested him instead of saying, my God, I've been wrong.
[19:21.280 --> 19:26.200]  I've been deceived. How could what I swear enough to be illegal? They went and arrested
[19:26.200 --> 19:33.480]  him. You see, it's the boldness of Homeland security to say that George Washington is
[19:33.480 --> 19:40.360]  bad. The boldness of saying the bill of rights is illegal. The boldness to recruit secretly
[19:40.360 --> 19:47.680]  preachers. The boldness to build FEMA camps for political dissidents. It is so bold that
[19:47.680 --> 19:53.200]  a lot of people just buy it. Well, he's got the courage to come on. He's coming on. Stay
[19:53.200 --> 19:59.800]  with us. Do you know the truth about cancer treatments? Do you realize that with all presently
[19:59.800 --> 20:05.400]  accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer and you are mostly fighting to

[20:10.920 --> 20:18.400]  of your entire system are totally unnecessary? But now it's cancer's turn to die with lace

[20:54.360 --> 21:02.200]  It is a big idea. A new world order. In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful
[21:02.200 --> 21:09.160]  world government. It's known as the Bilderberg Group. Is both their objective the world domination?
[21:09.160 --> 21:14.560]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the new world
[21:14.560 --> 21:23.400]  order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand. For the first time
[21:23.400 --> 21:29.080]  in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open. You will learn the secret
[21:29.080 --> 21:33.600]  that drives the entire new world order agenda. Bilderberg is making great progress toward
[21:33.600 --> 21:36.800]  a world economy. Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the
[21:36.800 --> 21:41.720]  money they need. They're after power. That's their after-views. Order in-game on DVD at

[22:53.280 --> 22:57.320]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees. The forces of globalism are destroying national
[22:57.320 --> 23:02.160]  sovereignty worldwide, but in Liberty's darkest hour there is hope. The first time in modern
[23:02.160 --> 23:07.000]  history the people are beginning to wake up. It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate
[23:07.000 --> 23:10.880]  their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan. We have a short time
[23:10.880 --> 23:16.560]  frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat. In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv

[23:55.840 --> 24:01.600]  Look, this is what it comes down to. I can't believe that I'm a radical. I can't believe
[24:01.600 --> 24:13.280]  that I'm seen as extreme. Because I flipped out when I went to urban warfare drills and videotaped
[24:13.280 --> 24:20.720]  U.S. Marines with foreign troops on video saying they were training to execute American citizens
[24:21.600 --> 24:25.520]  and practicing putting us on our knees and blowing our heads off.
[24:25.520 --> 24:34.480]  Of course, I came back and warned everyone. Of course, I put the video out and the mind control
[24:34.480 --> 24:41.280]  public, hundreds of emails and calls said that I hired a Marine Corps aircraft carrier,
[24:41.280 --> 24:47.200]  the medium sized ones, the USS Coronado, that I hired hovercraft, that I hired thousands of troops
[24:47.200 --> 24:54.160]  instead of just going to the Marine Corps website where they had their own photos of it.
[24:55.840 --> 25:01.760]  That's the denial because people couldn't believe the Marines are training to put you on your knees
[25:01.760 --> 25:05.920]  and stick a muzzle to the back of your head and blow your brains out in front of your kids, okay?
[25:07.840 --> 25:14.640]  You know, that'll make you lose sleep at night seeing that 10 years ago and trying to warn people
[25:14.640 --> 25:19.280]  that they've been gearing up all along. And don't give me your crap about what are you against our
[25:19.280 --> 25:24.400]  Marines? You bet I am if they're against this country. You bet I am if they want to kill American
[25:24.400 --> 25:28.800]  citizens. I'm not against the individual Marines. I'm against the training they've been getting,
[25:28.800 --> 25:31.680]  just like I'm not against guns. I'm against them being misused.
[25:33.440 --> 25:38.400]  You're so brainwashed. You think you're in Kansas. You think everything's nice. It's okay. It's not.
[25:38.400 --> 25:43.440]  They're dismantling the country right now. They geared up the police and military so that when you
[25:43.440 --> 25:48.640]  try to stop their total takeover, when you finally figure it out, they're going to gun you down on
[25:48.640 --> 25:53.520]  the streets. They're going to have their knitting preachers and their snake oil salesmen running
[25:53.520 --> 25:57.200]  around the streets telling you to go along with it. And the local news is going to tell you to go
[25:57.200 --> 26:02.720]  along with it. When I'm dead in some ditch, when these murdering drug dealers have had their way
[26:02.720 --> 26:07.440]  with me because you were weak and stupid, they're going to take everything you've got, you nation
[26:07.440 --> 26:14.640]  of cowards. I'm going to tell you something right now. The fact that, and these guys have more
[26:14.640 --> 26:22.320]  courage than most people. I've begged hundreds of preachers and I've begged hundreds of people
[26:22.320 --> 26:26.240]  going to colleges to come on and talk about this stuff and give their names and they'll never do
[26:26.240 --> 26:32.240]  it. The ones that have that Homeland Security come after them. But what is coming after them,
[26:32.240 --> 26:35.680]  coming to them and saying, we're watching you now. You shouldn't have talked. You should,
[26:35.680 --> 26:40.000]  you shouldn't have talked in our country. Shouldn't have talked. Shouldn't have talked about how
[26:40.000 --> 26:44.160]  there's secret police everywhere and how they've recruited everybody and how our country's going
[26:44.160 --> 26:51.680]  down the tubes. We got to stop these people. They can't succeed if we expose them. Meanwhile,
[26:51.680 --> 26:56.320]  our movement does nothing but fight with each other and nitty about who likes who and who
[26:56.320 --> 27:01.200]  covers what group and who covers, you know, this group and who knows all the answers and who's
[27:01.200 --> 27:07.520]  exactly right. Look, all I know is they're carrying eugenics out against us. All these dumb preachers
[27:07.520 --> 27:11.200]  that are going along with this, all these dumb cops, they're shooting you up full of mercury,
[27:11.200 --> 27:17.040]  cancer, viruses, everything else you can imagine. And that's just in the shots, you fools. All I
[27:17.040 --> 27:22.320]  know is they're spraying us. All I know is they're staging wars and devaluing our dollar and
[27:22.320 --> 27:33.120]  gotten this completely. Meanwhile, our own movement, not the good people out there taking action.
[27:33.120 --> 27:37.440]  You're the reason we woke up so many people, but so many of the people that try to actually speak
[27:37.440 --> 27:41.920]  out and become prominent, spend half their time attacking other patriots. I don't do that.
[27:43.040 --> 27:46.880]  Other people that got their head screwed on straight like Mark Kornke and others don't do
[27:46.880 --> 27:51.440]  that. You got to get your heads out of your hind ends. Excuse me for talking like that,
[27:51.440 --> 27:57.840]  but this is life and death. This isn't a game or a joke to me. Do you understand when men in
[27:57.840 --> 28:03.600]  black suits and sunglasses come and tell people at major colleges here in the United States that
[28:03.600 --> 28:10.720]  they're not allowed to teach children about the bellow rights? We got a problem. The people that
[28:10.720 --> 28:16.240]  teach that are terrorists on the face of it. The people that do that have declared themselves
[28:16.240 --> 28:22.000]  enemies of this country. You can't get a better declaration of their intent and who they are.
[28:22.000 --> 28:27.840]  They might as well run up the Jolly Roger. I mean, that is so piratical. That is so in your face.
[28:32.960 --> 28:36.160]  No, and this isn't a scene from Red Dawn at the reeducation camp,
[28:37.360 --> 28:42.960]  where they're calling your founding fathers, our pigs scum, who will oppressing the lower classes.
[28:42.960 --> 28:47.520]  You watch that movie and it's a setting from what they really had in reeducation camps
[28:47.520 --> 28:51.440]  in Eastern Europe when they take over Czechoslovakia, Romania, other places.
[28:53.360 --> 28:58.640]  East Germany. That's what they do. They take you to sports stadiums, have you tattle on each other,
[28:58.640 --> 29:04.400]  train you how to be scumbags, break you. They got their movie screens blurping out all their
[29:04.400 --> 29:09.440]  trash. That's exactly what you'd hear out of a Hollywood movie about Soviets taking over the
[29:09.440 --> 29:15.680]  United States would be men in black suits telling young pastors that they can't teach
[29:17.680 --> 29:24.480]  boy scouts about the Bill of Rights. Now, we're going to talk to both these guys on the other side
[29:24.480 --> 29:28.080]  and it'll be up to them if they give their names. It'll be up to them if they talk about where this
[29:28.080 --> 29:34.880]  is happening. And in this country, you're this, this, this is major courage in this climate.
[29:34.880 --> 29:39.920]  I'm not attacking our guests. I'm saluting them. But for me, there's not even a debate about whether
[29:39.920 --> 30:05.120]  I would go public. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

[30:56.320 --> 31:01.040]  movement now being planned to join church and state. This confederation of evangelicals,
[31:01.040 --> 31:05.040]  Catholics and Protestant denominations will form one huge political voting block.
[31:05.040 --> 31:10.080]  Their agenda is enforcement of religious worship and morality by legislation. Our forefathers wrote
[31:10.080 --> 31:14.480]  the Bill of Rights to guarantee all Americans this freedom, liberty of conscience. History and the
[31:14.480 --> 31:18.880]  Bible proved to them that these two systems, church and state, must be kept separate. It must
[31:18.880 --> 31:24.000]  be our love of God and of country that prompts or constrains us. This will change the character,
[31:24.000 --> 31:28.000]  not civil enforcement. From history, we saw that when church and state united, known as
[31:28.000 --> 31:32.800]  papal Rome, religious intolerance resulted. This union would go directly contrary to the great
[31:32.800 --> 31:38.080]  principles of our nation. America and papal Rome are uniting in this agenda. Protestant America,
[31:38.080 --> 31:43.760]  awake before it is too late. The prophecies are fast fulfilling. Jesus is coming soon. For free

[31:53.200 --> 31:58.240]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism,
[31:58.240 --> 32:02.880]  but globalism. Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business and the American
[32:02.880 --> 32:08.480]  empire instead of what's fair for the American people. The only antidote to the poison of globalism
[32:08.480 --> 32:13.520]  is nationalism. Start reading The Nationalist Times each month. The Nationalist Times promotes

[32:53.680 --> 33:10.240]  Okay, we're gonna go ahead and go straight to our guest. One is Steve, one is Jeff. It's up to them
[33:10.240 --> 33:14.960]  if they want to, in the course of this interview, give their names. I know Steve does, but if he does,
[33:14.960 --> 33:23.120]  then that'll expose Jeff. This is one of the largest, I'll just say that, Christian universities in
[33:23.120 --> 33:33.840]  Texas. This is a major university. If I said the biggest, it would give it away, and this is what
[33:33.840 --> 33:39.680]  our country has turned into. Now understand, I have the FBI training manual, and in the fourth hour
[33:39.680 --> 33:44.640]  when we're doing the TV show where we simulcast the radio as a television transmission for
[33:44.640 --> 33:50.960]  PrisonPlanet.TV viewers, I will show you the FBI flyer, FBI training manuals. In my film,
[33:50.960 --> 33:56.000]  Road to Terror, we have video of FEMA teaching police in Kansas City and Firemen that the
[33:56.000 --> 34:02.160]  founding fathers were bad and terrorist. Here it says constitutionalist, people that talk about
[34:02.160 --> 34:07.920]  the Constitution, those that make frequent references to the Constitution, quote, defenders
[34:07.920 --> 34:13.440]  of the US Constitution are terrorists, call the terrorism hotline immediately. The police are
[34:13.440 --> 34:19.840]  taught this nationwide. Now, first it was 13,000 preachers in 2006 when it was a secret program.
[34:19.840 --> 34:26.800]  We broke it here with secret, marked secret, not for distribution, documents with the first
[34:26.800 --> 34:31.680]  13,000 preachers recruited, and we had two different pastors on, butch poxley broke it,
[34:31.680 --> 34:36.000]  we put it out nationwide here. We had the pastors on, one of them got a Homeland Security visit.
[34:37.200 --> 34:44.000]  Now, we put the secret documents up on the site. A year plus later, local news and then even
[34:44.000 --> 34:48.320]  national news reported that, yes, but they said it was good, preachers are getting their flocks
[34:48.320 --> 34:53.840]  ready for martial law, to have their guns taken and to have their families taken. Now, the preachers
[34:53.840 --> 34:57.840]  told us they were trained to tell people to let the government take your children, to go to camps,
[34:57.840 --> 35:04.320]  to be forcibly inoculated, to go to labor facilities. Now, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen,
[35:04.320 --> 35:11.440]  that then came out, okay. Now, we're telling you this is a massive program, 26,000 in infraguard,
[35:11.440 --> 35:18.000]  major CEOs, community leaders, they are being paid in many cases, federal money. The pastors are
[35:18.000 --> 35:22.560]  being paid to be part of this. The colleges are getting billions of dollars every year
[35:22.560 --> 35:27.200]  to be part of this. This is a total violation of the First Amendment. This is the government
[35:27.200 --> 35:34.000]  taking over. This is classical tyranny, but it's different to have a government training manual
[35:34.000 --> 35:40.400]  or a video of FEMA saying it. It's more powerful to have the state police pull Abbey Newman over,
[35:40.400 --> 35:45.840]  no criminal record, naval veteran in Virginia. This is in road to tyranny. She has a pocket
[35:45.840 --> 35:50.720]  constitution, one of my videos in the back, and they say, I think this is illegal. That's a
[35:50.720 --> 35:55.440]  raster. I don't think she's allowed to have this contraband. And again, again, they swore an oath
[35:55.440 --> 36:00.720]  to it. We have state police saying a constitution is contraband. Now, now I know to the average
[36:00.720 --> 36:05.520]  listener, even mainstream people that are somewhat dumbed down, you're like the constitution's
[36:05.520 --> 36:13.920]  illegal. That's what I'm, this is so crazy. It's the boldness of this. It is so bold. I mean,
[36:13.920 --> 36:22.080]  I've got mainstream law enforcement magazines that say like law enforcement technology in 2000
[36:22.080 --> 36:26.720]  put out an issue. And it said, if you see someone with a get us out of the UN sticker, go ahead
[36:26.720 --> 36:32.080]  and arrest them, find reasons to charge them. They're terrorist. And it said, police chiefs,
[36:32.080 --> 36:37.920]  don't punish your officers. Just support them for the arrest of the bumper sticker. I mean,
[36:37.920 --> 36:42.080]  and then I have the manual right here where it says it. Go ahead and call Homeland Security,
[36:42.080 --> 36:47.760]  call the FBI. They've got to get us out of the UN sticker. I mean, folks, it's so far gone. Huge
[36:47.760 --> 36:52.480]  black ops, FEMA camps built. I'm going to shut up now, but I know a lot of people will be tuning
[36:52.480 --> 36:56.080]  into this on YouTube and Google. When it gets posted, I wanted them to hear an introduction
[36:56.080 --> 37:03.680]  to this to understand. And what I've given you is a small piece of it. Let's go to Jeff, and we're
[37:03.680 --> 37:08.240]  not going to give Jeff's last name unless he chooses as calmly as you can. Tell us when this
[37:08.240 --> 37:16.480]  happened. What happened? Are you there, Jeff? Yes, I'm right here. Okay, you've got the floor.
[37:16.480 --> 37:21.360]  Tell us, tell us you're in Texas. We'll leave it and just tell us a little bit of details. Tell
[37:21.360 --> 37:27.760]  us exactly what happened. Well, I'm a Bible college student and also an interim pastor
[37:27.760 --> 37:33.920]  in a small church in Mount Vernon, Texas. And at the school I go to, I work in the advising
[37:33.920 --> 37:41.680]  office. And one day, last, it was at the end of September, first of October, right before I took
[37:41.680 --> 37:49.440]  this church I'm at. We had a group of boy scouts come by and part of my duty is in the advising
[37:49.440 --> 37:57.760]  offices to give tests and PR type things. And so anyways, they came by and I was assigned to take
[37:57.760 --> 38:05.440]  them around campus and talk to them about how we apply Americanism and patriotism and teaching
[38:05.440 --> 38:12.080]  and taking those things, kinds of things further in higher education essentially is what it's
[38:12.080 --> 38:17.360]  pulled down to. And so I was taking them around campus showing them different things, showing
[38:17.360 --> 38:23.920]  different monuments and statutes where, you know, people on campus. And so I was sitting down with
[38:23.920 --> 38:32.160]  them outside at a gazebo and I sat there and I told them, I said, boys, it's going to be you
[38:33.040 --> 38:40.240]  who is going to take this country and to either make or break it. You need to get back to your
[38:40.240 --> 38:44.320]  constitution. You need to get to know your bill of rights and you need to stand up for them because
[38:45.360 --> 38:50.080]  it's, we're fast losing them and it's going to be your generation and as well as ours,
[38:50.080 --> 38:56.800]  but yours is really going to get the point of it. And well, so we continue to, well, the next day
[38:56.800 --> 39:01.600]  I got called into... I want to stop you because, and again, I appreciate your courage. I've gotten
[39:01.600 --> 39:06.480]  hundreds of documents, scores of videos, but the average pastor or the average
[39:08.720 --> 39:13.280]  college student or professor is so scared when they get threatened by these men in black and
[39:13.280 --> 39:19.920]  that's what happened to you that they won't come on air. Now let's be specific here about the
[39:19.920 --> 39:25.120]  land of the free home of the brave because I want to be specific. All you said was is that we're
[39:25.120 --> 39:30.160]  losing our bill of rights and constitution. It's up to you to defend it. Can you be as specific
[39:30.160 --> 39:36.080]  about the thought crime you committed, exactly what you said to them? I mean, like you're talking
[39:36.080 --> 39:41.760]  to those same, teleport yourself back to that gazebo as you're talking to these 10 and 12
[39:41.760 --> 39:47.680]  and 13 year olds about their duty as an American. I mean, they don't get any more John Wayne than
[39:47.680 --> 39:52.880]  this. And then just go back to exactly what you said to them. Well, I told him, I said,
[39:52.880 --> 39:59.040]  boy, I was a weeble old scout and my scout master told me and told us,
[39:59.040 --> 40:04.240]  told us our constitution and it wasn't for him. I wouldn't have memorized a whole lot of it
[40:04.240 --> 40:08.800]  and come to love it and come to see it for the document it is. And I said, boy, it's up to you
[40:08.800 --> 40:14.960]  because our government is fast losing, fast taking away our rights. And I said, and I encourage
[40:14.960 --> 40:19.280]  him to, I mentioned the Patriot Act and I said, you need to read, you need to study. And I said,
[40:20.080 --> 40:24.960]  and I said, boys, I said, under that they're they're stripping us of what we know to be America.
[40:24.960 --> 40:30.400]  And I said, I told him, I said, listen, what you need to do is you need to reorient yourself to
[40:30.400 --> 40:38.640]  the constitution because that is the very founding basis of our government. And it is the supreme
[40:38.640 --> 40:44.880]  law of the land. And without it, we cannot stand or fall. And I said, what you it's going to be up
[40:44.880 --> 40:50.320]  to you boys as you grow and as you learn and interpret the constitution, it's going to be you
[40:50.320 --> 40:57.280]  who can either take us down the road to tyranny and to abolish America or to take us back to where
[40:57.280 --> 41:01.760]  we need to be. And that that's basically what I told them that gotten in trouble.
[41:01.760 --> 41:10.640]  Now, how long ago was this in the September 1st of October? Okay, so it's taking you this long.
[41:11.280 --> 41:15.600]  And I guess to discuss it, you know, pray about it, think about it to decide to go public. We'll
[41:15.600 --> 41:21.600]  talk about why you're doing that. Now is what is what scared me and I'll be honest with everybody
[41:21.600 --> 41:29.040]  who's listening. I was a fence sitter early until then. My friend Steve who's on, he had
[41:29.040 --> 41:33.920]  shown me some movies and some things. And I had had my suspicions and my doubts, but
[41:34.720 --> 41:40.560]  but the next day when they called me into the office of port four of the main administrative
[41:40.560 --> 41:44.960]  building, you know, you get called up there. That's that's where the president and the provost and
[41:44.960 --> 41:50.240]  all that. And so it's pretty big business. And I got called up there and then I thought, well,
[41:50.240 --> 41:53.600]  you know, I'm in trouble. They're going to explore from the school or just just all those
[41:53.600 --> 41:58.880]  kinds of things. And so I get up there and I go into the president's office and there's this
[41:58.880 --> 42:04.320]  man. He's wearing a black suit, black tie, a white shirt, sunglasses, and there was another
[42:04.320 --> 42:11.760]  man dressed similarly. And he said, sir, did you say such and such? Did you tell this, this truth
[42:11.760 --> 42:18.720]  about the Boy Scout, about the Constitution yesterday? And I said, well, yeah, and then he
[42:18.720 --> 42:22.960]  threw down a copy of a transcript of everything I was saying. He said, could you fill in the blanks
[42:22.960 --> 42:30.400]  here and fill in the blanks here? And that just it sent me over the edge. And Alex said,
[42:30.400 --> 42:34.480]  it's scary. It's really good. And I, you know,
[42:35.280 --> 42:38.960]  scared you. I mean, I'm not a tough guy, but I would have had to physically control myself.
[42:38.960 --> 42:43.920]  You were in the room with absolute enemies of the republic. I mean, you were in the room
[42:43.920 --> 42:49.840]  with cancer. I asked him, I asked him, well, sir, who are you from? And he told me, he said,
[42:49.840 --> 42:55.920]  you're committing acts of terror and espionage by telling these students what to do. He said,
[42:55.920 --> 43:01.760]  that's not your place. And I said, this is a college campus. I said, that's it. No, sir,
[43:01.760 --> 43:05.920]  you don't, I said, you're, you're out of line. And I don't appreciate you telling me that. But
[43:07.280 --> 43:10.160]  but after that, I just kind of shut up and took my beating, if you will.
[43:10.160 --> 43:14.320]  Okay, let's stop right there. I want everybody listening to understand. I have the video. I
[43:14.320 --> 43:19.520]  have the training manuals. I have the legislation. I all of it. And I've given it all to you before
[43:19.520 --> 43:24.080]  it came out years before. I'm saying that not to toot my horn. I'm totally freaked out.
[43:24.080 --> 43:30.240]  This is real. They are training to blow your head off. Okay. With foreign troops, you can't
[43:30.240 --> 43:35.680]  make this up. It's so horrible. I want you to slowly, as slowly as you can, because you're
[43:35.680 --> 43:40.480]  being debriefed here on international radio. Okay. And we need more people to come public and we
[43:40.480 --> 43:48.480]  can actually stop their whole program if people realize how evil and how bad this is. Describe,
[43:48.480 --> 43:55.600]  you walk in, whose room you're in, what the men say, go back to and picture exactly what they
[43:55.600 --> 44:03.760]  said and replay that to us right now. I was, I walked into a conference room with some officials
[44:03.760 --> 44:12.320]  from the university and there were two men. One was, as I said, he was dressed in all black
[44:12.320 --> 44:18.880]  and he had on sunglasses. He wouldn't give his name. He didn't have any kind of real identity.
[44:19.440 --> 44:23.680]  Very, in fact, I followed the movement in black. I thought, well, this is strange.
[44:24.240 --> 44:28.480]  And there was another man. He was dressed similarly. He had on a gray suit with a,
[44:28.480 --> 44:36.640]  I think it was a blue or red tie. Anyways, they were dressed. And I walked in and the man in
[44:36.640 --> 44:42.240]  the gray suit put down on the table. He put down a transcript of everything that I had
[44:42.240 --> 44:48.560]  said and that was said in that, in that usable, in that scenario with those students, with those
[44:48.560 --> 44:57.360]  scouts. And for those of you listening, it's real. I'm not anybody who's got anything interested
[44:57.360 --> 45:03.120]  or vested or anything like that. I'm just a college student and a young man in the ministry
[45:03.120 --> 45:09.440]  and here they are. And I saw the transcript of every word I've said and every word that
[45:09.440 --> 45:13.520]  those boys had said and the things that are dialed in.
[45:14.560 --> 45:18.880]  Now, how did they get it? Did one of the boy scouts, was there anybody with them?
[45:18.880 --> 45:22.720]  Did they get it from a security camera, which they use to spy on the citizens and then
[45:22.720 --> 45:25.440]  goes EBO? Did you find out where they got that transcript?
[45:26.240 --> 45:31.840]  No, I didn't. And to be quite honest, I'm scared to even start to work because
[45:32.800 --> 45:38.640]  my thinking is, is they got that much power than where, where, where will it stop?
[45:38.640 --> 45:43.840]  If I start to pry, what, what will happen? Well, it, it, it's, it's, it's going to stop
[45:43.840 --> 45:47.760]  with you dying of cancer, sir. They've been planted you and every one of us that's taken
[45:47.760 --> 45:53.440]  the inoculations. These are eugenicists and we're, we're in a crisis people can't even imagine.
[45:53.440 --> 45:58.800]  It's so bad and, and, and, and so serious. By the way, I have all the documents on that for
[45:58.800 --> 46:02.320]  new listeners and I'm done shows and we'll do more shows on it. If you didn't know about that,
[46:02.320 --> 46:06.320]  you need to find out for cops listening right now. When your mama, when your kids, when your wife,
[46:06.320 --> 46:10.400]  when your husband's dying, you know, when, when, when one in two of us has got it, it's one in
[46:10.400 --> 46:16.960]  three now, maybe then you'll listen. But let me just go back here to everybody. Now, now,
[46:16.960 --> 46:22.880]  now you said, you said, you said there was a, there was a, there was a scout master that was
[46:22.880 --> 46:30.800]  wooden and he, he worked, he had a military crew cut. He went back to Marine. He really did.
[46:30.800 --> 46:36.560]  I don't know if, if that or the camera, the cameras could have picked up something.
[46:37.600 --> 46:43.040]  It was in a pretty populated area. You can hear a lot that goes on at that spot. Well,
[46:43.040 --> 46:48.800]  a lot of cell phones, a lot of cell phones now have video and audio and I would imagine it's him.
[46:48.800 --> 46:53.600]  They started the scouts for military training and they've glommed on now to get the kids inducted
[46:53.600 --> 46:58.560]  directly into the new world order meat grinder. So it was probably him or it was surveillance
[46:58.560 --> 47:02.720]  cameras, but let's go back. You said you then sat there and took your beating. What else?
[47:02.720 --> 47:06.720]  It's very important. What else? Who did the talking, the guy in black or the guy in gray
[47:06.720 --> 47:12.240]  doing any talking? Well, the guy in black pretty, he, he acted like he was pretty much in charge.
[47:12.240 --> 47:17.040]  The guy in gray was kind of his, his mouthpiece, but every now and then he'd speak up and, and
[47:17.920 --> 47:22.880]  when he spoke, it was like, I don't mean to be sacrilegious, but it was like God speaking.
[47:22.880 --> 47:28.320]  And, and, but he basically, they, what they basically told me was this, they said, listen,
[47:28.960 --> 47:34.880]  if you say anything, do anything, continue to do these kinds of things, we can have your head
[47:34.880 --> 47:40.560]  on a silver platter and the university's head on a silver platter and all the programs and
[47:40.560 --> 47:45.360]  things that they've got going on and I, that's, that's, I believe them.
[47:47.520 --> 47:52.400]  And don't worry, they're not going to let go of that college with all those millions of minds
[47:52.400 --> 47:56.640]  they're going to get to put in black uniforms and, and, and, and think they're quote,
[47:56.640 --> 48:01.360]  defend in Jesus, putting people in, in, in FEMA camps, you know, because we're of the devil and
[48:01.360 --> 48:06.160]  secretly working with Al Qaeda, fighting the precious, you know, you know, Israelis. And,
[48:06.160 --> 48:10.720]  I mean, that's basically the brainwashing modes going on. They have different nodules, different
[48:10.720 --> 48:16.400]  modes, packages for different colleges, different mindsets. Every major college is now a factory
[48:16.400 --> 48:25.120]  of evil. But expanding, expanding on this, I had been talking to Steve, who we're about to bring
[48:25.120 --> 48:30.160]  up. He said that you said, I want to get it directly from you, that the high level college
[48:30.160 --> 48:37.760]  official, we'll just say that was quote, shaking. He was, I never seen him that nervous. And he's
[48:37.760 --> 48:44.080]  a pretty steady man. He's an ex Marine, ex Navy, you know, he's a military veteran, certain Vietnam
[48:44.080 --> 48:51.360]  and I, I never, never seen him to be, to be like he was. And I knew he was, he, he appeared very
[48:51.360 --> 48:57.120]  much agitated. Well, that's because our colleges are already under infrastructure, quote, protection,
[48:57.120 --> 49:02.080]  which means they're already locked down prisons. And I guarantee you, he knew he was seeing the
[49:02.080 --> 49:07.200]  end of the country. And that's why he was agitated. I don't think you saw fear. I think he realizes,
[49:07.200 --> 49:13.760]  go ahead. Our university, our university is also where we just are completing the finalization
[49:13.760 --> 49:21.200]  process for re accreditation. And, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm sure they can mess with that too,
[49:21.200 --> 49:28.000]  you know, if, if, you know, whatever. It's a, it's scary. It's scary, Mr. Jones. Well, that's
[49:28.000 --> 49:33.360]  like head start bushes. It's federalizing all the local schools now. This is all excuses to take
[49:33.360 --> 49:40.560]  control. And, I mean, how long did this go on? As they told you, we could quote, have your head
[49:40.560 --> 49:48.160]  on a silver platter. It, it lasted about 20 minutes, 15, 20 minutes. This is absolutely key.
[49:48.160 --> 49:54.240]  You've got to go buy one of those little cheap, you know, 20, 30 bucks at Best Buy audio recorders
[49:54.240 --> 49:59.120]  get good with it. So you don't fumble. And then next time they walk up on you or next time,
[49:59.120 --> 50:04.000]  you know, they, they're criminals. So they like to sneak up, you just have it in your pocket and
[50:04.000 --> 50:08.400]  just hit record. So you can get the enemy's operation on tape and we're going to get it.
[50:08.400 --> 50:12.400]  We're going to get you. We're going to win. You may be able to get me, you bastards,
[50:12.400 --> 50:16.880]  but you're not going to get the country. You're going down. I want them to know that. I mean,
[50:16.880 --> 50:20.640]  what was this, you know, your friend Steve's been telling you about this. And I'm sorry,
[50:20.640 --> 50:26.160]  I'm so angry. Jeff, it just, they've ruined my life. They ruined my country. I'm, I'm sorry,
[50:26.160 --> 50:29.120]  go ahead. I mean, what was it like for you when you realized it was all true?
[50:30.960 --> 50:37.280]  Mr. Jones, for all those who are sitting on the side of this voice, it, it brought home a lot
[50:37.280 --> 50:44.240]  of things that I had suspected. And I went to my room and I broke down in tears because
[50:45.120 --> 50:50.160]  they fit our country's job and stay there. Stay there, sir. We'll be right back. We'll also talk to Steve.

[52:06.800 --> 52:16.720]  you have not been told from another untoldstory.com. There is much untold story of the true story of
[52:16.720 --> 52:23.840]  America, such as the fact that Columbus did not discover America, such as Viking leaf Erickson
[52:23.840 --> 52:29.760]  was here long before Columbus, such as there were actually Christians living here a thousand years
[52:29.760 --> 52:35.920]  before Columbus, according to the archaeological record revealed in the book, Christians before
[52:35.920 --> 52:44.400]  Columbus, such as the name America, what the word America itself means. Amir or Amil means heaven,
[52:44.400 --> 52:53.840]  and rica or rike means kingdom or dominion, thus America means heavenly kingdom. Of the 31,173
[52:53.840 --> 53:00.000]  verses in the Bible, there was one verse used as a launching verse by those white Christian
[53:00.000 --> 53:07.280]  Europeans called pilgrims before they came to America in the 1600s. Do you know what that verse
[53:07.280 --> 53:17.040]  was and why it of all the 31,173 verses was used and the significance of its use concerning the
[53:17.040 --> 53:24.640]  beginning of what we now call the nation of America. It's an untold story told at another
[53:24.640 --> 53:31.440]  untoldstory.com. It's quite a story told nowhere else. Go there because it's only posted there for
[53:31.440 --> 53:40.400]  a short period of time.
[53:40.400 --> 54:05.280]  Bondage was hard fought. You know what they call the old glory because fighting five to one on
[54:05.280 --> 54:11.120]  average for eight years we kicked the greatest military in the world but they'd never been
[54:11.120 --> 54:17.200]  beaten. They recalled the Invincibles. We beat them again in 1812 with old Hickory.
[54:20.240 --> 54:25.200]  Beat the Germans, the Japanese, everybody and we did have liberty and freedom to some extent
[54:26.080 --> 54:30.000]  and a man held his head high. You had free speech in this country
[54:30.000 --> 54:37.520]  and now look at a secret police everywhere. FEMA camps built their poison in the water
[54:37.520 --> 54:44.480]  spraying overhead. They're very very serious. You understand there's secret police everywhere.
[54:46.160 --> 54:51.120]  Now if you give in to them they win. You see that's how this works. They've got to quietly
[54:51.120 --> 54:54.880]  take over all the infrastructure and then get everybody ready for the next phase and that's
[54:54.880 --> 54:59.120]  taking your bank accounts everything. Then the yuppies are going to scream bloody murder and
[54:59.120 --> 55:04.640]  say we'll do whatever you say as long as you give us milk and honey back as long as you give us
[55:04.640 --> 55:11.680]  bread and circuits and then they're going to say okay you do this. Now it's in law now. It's
[55:11.680 --> 55:16.480]  totally unconstitutional and a fraud. Bush can't declare himself emperor. Hillary can't neither
[55:16.480 --> 55:22.800]  can Obama or McCain that he is dictator. Congress can't even see the continuity of government plans
[55:23.760 --> 55:26.640]  but the cover letter says he's dictator and they said you can't see anymore.
[55:26.640 --> 55:31.440]  Now going back to Jeff who's at one of the biggest bible colleges in the country,
[55:32.240 --> 55:40.880]  one of the biggest in Texas and I want to bring Steve up your friend but who got you to come on
[55:40.880 --> 55:46.000]  Arab. I will tell you this. You were a little timid coming on. You said well I don't want to
[55:46.000 --> 55:49.840]  and I believe you did it for the reasons you said. You don't want to quote hurt the outreach and
[55:49.840 --> 55:54.560]  quote the good work. You said like how you guys do outreach overseas and in communist China and
[55:54.560 --> 56:02.320]  places. The point is if we're communist China or Nazi America it won't matter and does this fit in
[56:02.320 --> 56:06.800]  now with the pieces of the puzzle of how the preachers have been covertly hired by the government
[56:06.800 --> 56:14.320]  and the rest of it Jeff? Yes it does and I've heard reports and I know of pastors within my
[56:14.320 --> 56:20.640]  association the Rehabilith Association that have been approached by and have seen have been given
[56:20.640 --> 56:29.280]  documents like you talk about. It's real and it scares me. Mr. Jones and to all those who are
[56:29.280 --> 56:34.480]  listening I'll just be honest with you. You may not believe it and you may want to cry and you may
[56:34.480 --> 56:39.600]  want to do whatever you want to do but it's real. I mean they don't care who they go after anymore
[56:39.600 --> 56:44.320]  as long as they get their power and have complete control like it is in communist China.
[56:44.320 --> 56:48.640]  Well that's the other issue. Everywhere you've got these no bodies in black uniforms and black
[56:48.640 --> 56:53.360]  ties wearing black sunglasses getting to boss better men around getting to say you don't have
[56:53.360 --> 57:00.880]  freedom. I'll cut your head off boy. I run things and then bossing a school head around.
[57:00.880 --> 57:04.800]  You know I mean that's what we fought for. That's land of the free home of the brave.
[57:04.800 --> 57:09.920]  So you know so you can't tell Boy Scouts to defend and protect the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[57:09.920 --> 57:14.720]  Now I mean how do police get trained that the Bill of Rights is bad now when they swear an oath to it?
[57:14.720 --> 57:21.760]  It's it's an irony. But you know Mr. Jones and all the brother Barbara speak but I just
[57:21.760 --> 57:27.600]  would like to say this there's a lot of good people innocent people getting hurt by it and
[57:28.320 --> 57:32.320]  and we as patriots there's going to be some of us who are going to stand up and fight but
[57:32.320 --> 57:36.480]  there's going to be others of us who are going to be out there on the battlefield afterwards
[57:36.480 --> 57:44.000]  dressing the wounds and healing the families and that's that's my concern uh Mr. Jones especially
[57:44.000 --> 57:51.040]  after after seeing that and that's that's one reason for my timidity and and quote unquote
[57:51.040 --> 57:56.720]  going public or coming on this and talking to you about it because I I do want to see those
[57:56.720 --> 58:00.960]  and I want to help them I want to heal them because it's it's a nasty machine and it's
[58:00.960 --> 58:06.960]  eating up a lot of people. Now did these secret police ever say who they were? No they didn't.
[58:06.960 --> 58:14.160]  Well they did mention DHS and uh one of the officials had mentioned to me afterwards that FBI
[58:14.160 --> 58:19.040]  was involved somehow there was a state trooper that was on that was on the door watching the door
[58:19.040 --> 58:24.160]  making sure nobody got out but yeah well it's remember remember don't use their words it's
[58:24.160 --> 58:30.640]  a federal trooper chartered tonight in 18 in 1936 in the U.S. it's all federal we'll be right back

[1:03:02.960 --> 1:03:09.040]  suddenly it happened in your town well you know as it didn't surprise me one bit you know back on
[1:03:09.040 --> 1:03:15.520]  september 11 2001 i've been educating myself for years about this stuff through the john birch
[1:03:15.520 --> 1:03:20.800]  society through tax margin through others and then of course through you and i really appreciate
[1:03:20.800 --> 1:03:25.520]  y'all's efforts and how you are trying to make people aware what's going on but on september
[1:03:25.520 --> 1:03:32.160]  11 2001 when i saw what happened instinctively immediately what came to my mind was uh huh
[1:03:32.160 --> 1:03:38.960]  so this is how they're going to bring out about martial law in this country and i remember calling
[1:03:38.960 --> 1:03:45.520]  a radio show here in my local area talking to this guy john matthews is no longer in the air
[1:03:45.520 --> 1:03:50.640]  and telling him about what's going on in the aftermath of 9 11 and saying this is going to
[1:03:50.640 --> 1:03:55.840]  lead to martial law and he said no our constitution protects us and i said you don't understand how
[1:03:55.840 --> 1:04:00.560]  much of that's already gone he said speed go in the backyard and watch for black helicopters
[1:04:00.560 --> 1:04:06.240]  and he hung up on me however a year later he was on the same show talking to a guy that was an expert
[1:04:06.240 --> 1:04:10.800]  in dealing with the government talking about the patriot act and he said have you read this this
[1:04:10.800 --> 1:04:15.680]  scares me to death how they're going to take away liberty today i said uh huh now you're seeing

[1:08:14.560 --> 1:08:20.240]  the police chief of san antonio they tried to bribe and pay off recovered ops in preparation for
[1:08:20.240 --> 1:08:25.840]  martial law i knew when i interviewed thomas sanchez vietnam veteran who was an intelligence
[1:08:25.840 --> 1:08:30.640]  he was approached by the army to prepare the public for martial law we didn't know if martial law was
[1:08:30.640 --> 1:08:36.720]  coming when it was coming we just knew man there's this huge program in every county in every city
[1:08:36.720 --> 1:08:42.720]  to do this and now it's just massive and we said from government documents we got that they would
[1:08:42.720 --> 1:08:48.960]  use staged terror as the pretext to really build it up and then use it on us and they're doing it
[1:08:48.960 --> 1:08:54.160]  and it's again it's about bankrupting the economy it's about taking your private property rights

[1:10:53.680 --> 1:10:59.920]  to stand firm like you've talked about and it it takes a lot and when it happens to you if it
[1:10:59.920 --> 1:11:05.200]  does happen to you it will i'll tell you from my own personal experience it's it's going to be a
[1:11:05.200 --> 1:11:12.320]  great struggle for you to to to do what's right but um it's been very liberating talking with you
[1:11:12.320 --> 1:11:17.040]  mr jones it is let me tell you you've now committed you've now done one of the most important things
[1:11:17.040 --> 1:11:22.080]  in your life you stood up to them then you know you told those young men the truth and our young
[1:11:22.080 --> 1:11:27.360]  men wouldn't be drug addicts they wouldn't be lazy if the if the fathers and the male mentors
[1:11:27.360 --> 1:11:31.120]  were like the people that built this country you've got to give young men a mission you've got to
[1:11:31.120 --> 1:11:35.920]  explain to them that they're part of a great cause a cause of liberty and then they'll grow up
[1:11:35.920 --> 1:11:40.560]  straight and strong but see they've taken that away from our young men you were trying to give that
[1:11:40.560 --> 1:11:45.360]  back to them and that scared the enemy they're scared of you and they're scared of the spirit
[1:11:45.360 --> 1:11:50.880]  of the lord that lives in your heart anything else i appreciate you alex and it's going to take
[1:11:50.880 --> 1:11:56.000]  everyone of us to do our individual part to to bring this country back to where where it needs to be
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:12:02.800]  let me tell you you've crossed a a a rubicon uh and uh you're now in a bigger world and you've
[1:12:02.800 --> 1:12:06.960]  now committed but you said it was liberating do you feel the freedom now i mean do you feel like
[1:12:06.960 --> 1:12:11.040]  things just got bigger you didn't get bigger but like you're more in touch with the world i mean
[1:12:11.040 --> 1:12:16.160]  did you just feel that expansion when you stepped up to the plate against evil i mean real evil
[1:12:17.680 --> 1:12:22.400]  i do and i feel i feel i feel like i'm ready to preach and i feel like my preaching is going to
[1:12:22.400 --> 1:12:27.840]  be more powerful than what it has been yes yes god bless you we appreciate you jeff you bring
[1:12:27.840 --> 1:12:32.720]  to us take care god bless you we're we're there with you my friend everybody should pray for jeff
[1:12:32.720 --> 1:12:38.000]  um steve you're you're on with us now uh just you've got the floor anything you want to say
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:43.600]  about this case what it was like when your friend first told you this had happened yeah well like
[1:12:43.600 --> 1:12:49.360]  i said i wasn't a bit surprised and i'm right now i'm a mixed bag of emotions i mean my heart
[1:12:49.360 --> 1:12:54.800]  feels like it's going to bust out of my chest uh you know people always tell me you need to
[1:12:54.800 --> 1:13:01.520]  calm down you know you shouldn't be so driven by this but i'm like you alex i see what's going on
[1:13:01.520 --> 1:13:07.920]  and when when jeff shared this with me the first thing i thought of was man you need to get on
[1:13:07.920 --> 1:13:13.040]  alex's show because i know he'll jump over this because here's the thing i talked to guys in my
[1:13:13.040 --> 1:13:18.880]  church older men that actually went to the same college years ago and they said man back then
[1:13:18.880 --> 1:13:23.360]  that kind of thing would have never happened but i was kind of bothered by the response because
[1:13:23.360 --> 1:13:27.520]  they kind of chuckled a little bit about the whole thing and i think that's kind of the
[1:13:27.520 --> 1:13:32.480]  conditioned knee jerk response well it's a built-in cowardice they decide to make a joke out of it
[1:13:32.480 --> 1:13:38.240]  because they're upset deep down instead of being a man and letting the anger flow yeah and also
[1:13:38.240 --> 1:13:43.200]  because this is the main thing that we're encountering and you know that people are not living in
[1:13:43.200 --> 1:13:49.920]  reality people are being pleasantly distracted by all this junk like anna nicole smith and oj
[1:13:49.920 --> 1:13:54.880]  simpson and all this other junk and when i'm trying to get across the people look at folks
[1:13:54.880 --> 1:14:00.320]  this didn't happen up in new york city where we've been hearing about these police brutality
[1:14:00.320 --> 1:14:07.520]  or over in nazi germany or stalinist dresser mouse china this is in east texas good old boy
[1:14:07.520 --> 1:14:15.280]  bible baptist bible belt texas folks this is close to home in our backyard and alex listen
[1:14:15.280 --> 1:14:21.760]  i've got a tract that i got years ago it was a pro a pro life tract and i just want to real
[1:14:21.760 --> 1:14:28.240]  briefly i want to read one part of this that was written talking to christians about taking action
[1:14:28.240 --> 1:14:33.840]  against this hideous atrocity called abortion but of course this is just one piece of the puzzle
[1:14:33.840 --> 1:14:40.080]  this guy says i lived in germany during the nazi holocaust i considered myself a christian i
[1:14:40.080 --> 1:14:45.840]  attended church since i was a small boy we had heard the stories of what was happening to the jews
[1:14:45.840 --> 1:14:52.080]  but the most like most people in this country we which is the united states he's saying we tried to
[1:14:52.080 --> 1:14:58.080]  distance ourselves from the reality of what was really taking place what could anyone do to stop it
[1:14:58.080 --> 1:15:04.240]  and he mentioned in the church what they would do the song director when the cars the cattle cars
[1:15:04.240 --> 1:15:09.600]  and the trains were going by with all these people they heard them screaming for help they told them
[1:15:09.600 --> 1:15:14.960]  saying louder and see this is the thing alex i talked to my mother just a couple days ago i was
[1:15:14.960 --> 1:15:20.080]  trying to tell her about this stuff oh i don't believe that george brish is a christian and then
[1:15:20.080 --> 1:15:25.040]  she started going into a mode of singing praises to the lord and i'm all for that but listen
[1:15:25.040 --> 1:15:30.720]  i've found in fathers i've told people that like me and my old who had a trough in one hand
[1:15:30.720 --> 1:15:36.720]  and a sword in the other i've found in fathers when when uh paula dear went riding through the
[1:15:36.720 --> 1:15:42.800]  night like he did shouting two arms two arms the british are coming yes they prayed and they trusted
[1:15:42.800 --> 1:15:49.040]  god as they were taking up their muskets and they were able to turn back the enemy and do what we
[1:15:49.040 --> 1:15:54.320]  now know as the revolution because they were united because they were aware of what's going on
[1:15:54.320 --> 1:16:01.360]  and i am so sick and tired of christians here in america who think that somehow well you know
[1:16:01.360 --> 1:16:07.680]  we're just going to trust the lord and he's going to protect us but we do nothing other than saying
[1:16:07.680 --> 1:16:14.000]  that we believe when the fact is that god expects something to be done in our part because i had
[1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:19.280]  brother in the lord a well-meaning brother told me this out he said i believe that the biggest idol
[1:16:19.280 --> 1:16:26.320]  here in america today is liberty i disagree i believe liberty is a precious god-given commodity
[1:16:26.320 --> 1:16:31.360]  that we have a responsibility to guard let me stop you let me stop you we've got hundreds of millions
[1:16:31.360 --> 1:16:36.320]  of people being brainwashed by their churches telling them to lay down to evil go along with this
[1:16:36.320 --> 1:16:42.640]  and render under Caesar and submit and being a slave is good on and on and on they know what
[1:16:42.640 --> 1:16:49.840]  they're doing they understand what they're doing and for those that just tuned in secret police
[1:16:49.840 --> 1:16:56.560]  everywhere going in and threatening the uh one of the student administrators uh who's about to
[1:16:56.560 --> 1:17:02.160]  graduate college that you better not teach people about the bill of rights and constitution that's
[1:17:02.160 --> 1:17:09.600]  terrorism you could be arrested for terrorism for your speech i mean this isn't our country this
[1:17:10.400 --> 1:17:18.960]  is the opposite of that and it shows you these are the bad guys these are the bad men these are
[1:17:18.960 --> 1:17:25.920]  the people who are bad i mean this was going on before 9 11 they were teaching the local police
[1:17:25.920 --> 1:17:31.680]  and others that oh if somebody's got a pocket constitution arrest them i mean how brainwashed
[1:17:31.680 --> 1:17:37.520]  are these cops that they think the constitution's bad folks i mean do you have any idea how deep
[1:17:37.520 --> 1:17:42.800]  this has gotten uh what was it like for your friend who you said i had seen my films but didn't
[1:17:42.800 --> 1:17:48.000]  totally buy it i mean what did he say when he when uh jeff called you steve what did he say i mean
[1:17:48.000 --> 1:17:52.400]  did he call you that first day and say oh my gosh homeland security just came in and threatened me
[1:17:53.040 --> 1:17:58.560]  well i actually was the one that called him just to say hi and then you know i was talking to him
[1:17:58.560 --> 1:18:02.480]  about some of the things i've been hearing on your show recently and i try to listen on a daily
[1:18:02.480 --> 1:18:06.960]  basis and he was saying you know as a matter of fact and then he shared with me what happened
[1:18:06.960 --> 1:18:13.680]  last september and you know and the thing is it wasn't that he wasn't a believer before because
[1:18:13.680 --> 1:18:18.400]  when i showed him terror storm his mouth was on the ground he knew that this was real but it's
[1:18:18.400 --> 1:18:24.560]  just that he needed to have something to spur him into finally putting feet to his faith and doing
[1:18:24.560 --> 1:18:30.880]  something and so you know i like i said i thought man alex needs to know about this i know he'll
[1:18:30.880 --> 1:18:35.920]  jump all over this because this hits real close to home this is in the heart of america and that's
[1:18:35.920 --> 1:18:42.000]  what they want to strike at and acts i believe i told jeff this i believe the reason that they want
[1:18:42.000 --> 1:18:48.720]  america as the prize is because this is the base of world missions if they shut america down
[1:18:48.720 --> 1:18:53.760]  we're going to shut down the propagation of the gospel all over the world and that's the thing that
[1:18:53.760 --> 1:18:59.440]  i believe is the group must stop and where there is the gospel there where there is gospel there is
[1:18:59.440 --> 1:19:04.400]  liberty but see now they've already taken over the gospel they have the preachers the major
[1:19:05.440 --> 1:19:12.000]  denominations working for them just churning out evil folks you know if your pastor is telling you
[1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:17.360]  do what the government says submit they've been bought and paid for you understand that's the
[1:19:17.360 --> 1:19:21.280]  opposite of what the bible actually teaches and i know we have a lot of people that aren't christian
[1:19:21.280 --> 1:19:26.480]  aren't religious it doesn't matter the enemy is taking over to the churches this is the main
[1:19:26.480 --> 1:19:32.240]  battleground you better be aware of this well i tell you steve uh during the break i'm gonna give
[1:19:32.240 --> 1:19:38.720]  you my cell phone my home number be sure you give that to jeff uh this is very very serious uh we'll

[1:24:29.920 --> 1:24:34.560]  we've played audio of this it's it's it's insane it got even worse i was saying to
[1:24:34.560 --> 1:24:38.880]  steve during the break i said is there anything else you want to add and he said well philip bobbitt
[1:24:38.880 --> 1:24:42.880]  came to town now now remember on the cover of the statesman a month ago i made a big deal about it
[1:24:42.880 --> 1:24:46.640]  on air because it is a big deal they showed a picture of the constitution being burned
[1:24:48.080 --> 1:24:52.560]  and then it said fighting terrorism under it and then it went on for two pages to say getting
[1:24:52.560 --> 1:24:58.320]  rid of the constitution bill of rights and freedom is what we need to get rid of america i said it
[1:24:58.320 --> 1:25:05.760]  said it and that's who they have the the nephew of lbj top level strategist philip bobbitt runs the
[1:25:05.760 --> 1:25:15.120]  whole ut cia recruiting program uh let's go ahead and go back to uh steve so uh mr bobbitt
[1:25:15.120 --> 1:25:19.440]  fluttered into town maybe the burn copies of the constitution while he was there i mean
[1:25:19.440 --> 1:25:24.240]  did the police worship this i mean what was happening see this is the thing i the reason i
[1:25:24.240 --> 1:25:29.760]  wanted jeff to get in touch with it he has experienced just him himself one person a plethora
[1:25:29.760 --> 1:25:36.160]  of the issues you discuss on your show he shared one but he also shared with me about bobbitt
[1:25:36.160 --> 1:25:41.360]  being invited to his college there by a professor of history i believe was to speak
[1:25:41.360 --> 1:25:47.360]  because he wanted to get an opposing view of what true americanism was and so anyway when bobbitt
[1:25:47.360 --> 1:25:53.440]  started exposing all his wacko views that are so counterproductive to what we know is right
[1:25:53.440 --> 1:25:59.120]  he said that the professor basically interrupted him and told him that he was guilty of treason
[1:25:59.120 --> 1:26:03.360]  and he was a traitor and he should be tried as such and my understanding was i think they
[1:26:03.360 --> 1:26:08.640]  kicked him out and he's not of course invited back there again uh you know but he was comforted
[1:26:08.640 --> 1:26:14.000]  dismantling the constitution and that national sovereignty is bad all the things you had already
[1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:18.320]  covered that i heard you and commenting on this article but then i'm at homeland security oh i
[1:26:18.320 --> 1:26:22.240]  bet they've already been out there for the other guy i bet if you go ask the professor i bet he's
[1:26:22.240 --> 1:26:26.640]  been threatened and i bet they're fluttering around there yeah i would imagine that too
[1:26:26.640 --> 1:26:30.480]  i guarantee go check it you'll find out that's the case these guys are so predictable it's
[1:26:30.480 --> 1:26:37.440]  unbelievable you know also jeff is shared with me that they checked the water to the college there
[1:26:37.440 --> 1:26:43.360]  and it had very high concentrations of fluoride and other chemicals he said they put a filtration
[1:26:43.360 --> 1:26:50.080]  system on the college water system and since then the student's health has improved dramatically
[1:26:50.080 --> 1:26:58.560]  amazing let me just add this i have family in a little town in east texas and uh he he is the
[1:26:58.560 --> 1:27:04.160]  head guy at the water treatment and it comes out of the ground out of an aquifer totally clean
[1:27:04.720 --> 1:27:11.040]  they had a big fight six years ago about it totally clean uh and the feds came in and threatened them
[1:27:11.040 --> 1:27:17.120]  and then with the state made them add fluoride and chlorine to the aquifer pure spring water
[1:27:17.120 --> 1:27:23.600]  it's just unbelievable and by the way it's the same level that's in a swimming pool that kills fish
[1:27:23.600 --> 1:27:30.640]  but we drink it guaranteed to cause liver cancer uh bladder cancer kidney cancer just the chlorine
[1:27:30.640 --> 1:27:36.480]  alone again you're loving government i mean and again that's just another example i was hearing
[1:27:36.480 --> 1:27:40.880]  about this weekend from family about how all they were going but why the water is perfect it's
[1:27:40.880 --> 1:27:47.120]  totally clean they said you will add this you understand yeah i have some jeff also shared with
[1:27:47.120 --> 1:27:52.320]  me as a personal friend that's with the police force i think the sheriff's there in that area
[1:27:52.320 --> 1:27:56.880]  and he quit the force or he is quitting because he said now they're issuing them tasers
[1:28:00.560 --> 1:28:05.600]  and and the second you argue or ask a question they now taser you and then when you die they
[1:28:05.600 --> 1:28:11.680]  have the judges order the corner not to say that tasers kill you hey ask uh if i have time i just
[1:28:11.680 --> 1:28:17.920]  like to real briefly share a personal experience i had with cps oh it just goes on and on sure
[1:28:17.920 --> 1:28:23.360]  oh yeah i mean i i'm marked i know this so i'm not you know me going on give my name
[1:28:23.360 --> 1:28:28.080]  steve barbara okay so you guys already know who i am but i'm gonna stand up for what i know it's
[1:28:28.080 --> 1:28:35.280]  right because i rather burn bow i'd rather burn than bow uh back when my oldest son was seven
[1:28:35.280 --> 1:28:41.280]  years old this is about like 96 97 uh we had an incident happened he woke up in the middle
[1:28:41.280 --> 1:28:44.800]  of the night and was having apparently what was a nightmare and i tried to wake him up
[1:28:44.800 --> 1:28:51.360]  by gently smacking him on both sides of the face i left the bruise and so i called a friend of mine
[1:28:51.360 --> 1:28:56.720]  who's a pastor he took me to a local hospital and in my heart i was just having this impression
[1:28:56.720 --> 1:29:03.120]  don't do this there's going to be trouble well we went anyway i explained to the intake person
[1:29:03.120 --> 1:29:10.160]  what happened then the doctors there talked to me about it then they took my son back to xpx
[1:29:10.160 --> 1:29:14.880]  rate and the guy doing the x-rays told me you can't go back there with him i've since found out that
[1:29:14.880 --> 1:29:20.880]  was a violation of my rights uh didn't even read me the policies hospital's policy about this which
[1:29:20.880 --> 1:29:26.320]  i later found out but then the police came and interrogated me about it by the way a lot of
[1:29:26.320 --> 1:29:31.600]  people your son was sleepwalking the you get in a spot between waking and sleeping and uh

[1:34:36.080 --> 1:34:41.040]  creeping and color of law and intimidating people these people are because they're crooks people
[1:34:41.040 --> 1:34:45.200]  run in the system they know we're coming for them so this is their rearguard action they need to
[1:34:45.200 --> 1:34:50.400]  take over or they know we're going to bring them to justice uh but uh no what ended up happening
[1:34:50.400 --> 1:34:56.080]  with child kidnapping child pedophile services i've actually had two incidents with them the
[1:34:56.080 --> 1:35:01.600]  first one i was talking about they actually sent a young woman out to our door and so she
[1:35:01.600 --> 1:35:06.640]  and care basically interrogated all of our kids yeah but go back to the part about the police
[1:35:06.640 --> 1:35:11.920]  showing up uh because your son had been in a sleepwalking incident yeah they came to the
[1:35:11.920 --> 1:35:17.120]  hospital officials called the police unbeknownst to me they came out asked me what happened
[1:35:17.120 --> 1:35:21.200]  i told them the same exact thing i told the hospital officials so they wrote down a bunch
[1:35:21.200 --> 1:35:27.200]  of notes and this is why my son was back being x-rayed and they wouldn't let me go back there
[1:35:27.200 --> 1:35:32.000]  with him yeah that was while he was being interrogated right because while my son told me
[1:35:32.000 --> 1:35:37.280]  they're asking him does your parents spank you do you go to church you know they're asking
[1:35:37.280 --> 1:35:43.840]  these kind of questions do they smoke marijuana right have you seen your daddy's have you seen
[1:35:43.840 --> 1:35:48.160]  your did they pull out a doll that has genitalia and you know what kid hadn't walked in while
[1:35:48.160 --> 1:35:52.640]  you're in the shower it's over kids are gone flown to Saudi Arabia go ahead but here's the
[1:35:52.640 --> 1:35:58.560]  thing out the next day the cps worker showed up and so she talked to our kids individually
[1:35:58.560 --> 1:36:02.960]  i got a friend named no warrant though right the pedophile worker showed up without a warrant
[1:36:02.960 --> 1:36:08.240]  right and i got a friend named albert james dagger uh... i've actually just told him
[1:36:08.240 --> 1:36:13.440]  he's getting your endgame documentary because he's been warning people about the eugenics
[1:36:13.440 --> 1:36:18.400]  program since the sixties but uh... he wrote a pamphlet called what to do when they come
[1:36:18.400 --> 1:36:23.360]  for your children and i just read this that week so i know how to conduct myself for
[1:36:23.360 --> 1:36:29.520]  these people but here's the thing it because the conclusion of this woman so-called interviews
[1:36:29.520 --> 1:36:34.720]  she said to me well i just need to look around in your apartment and this is a quote out can
[1:36:34.720 --> 1:36:41.440]  see if you have any torture weapons this is what she said to me and when i call my lawyer
[1:36:41.440 --> 1:36:45.120]  who got her to back off because he said yeah this is the kind of tactics they use
[1:36:45.120 --> 1:36:49.520]  eventually we were cleared of any so-called wrongdoing and then they and then they call
[1:36:49.520 --> 1:36:55.040]  a steak knife in the drawer a a a a torture weapon yeah right steak knives get your kids
[1:36:55.040 --> 1:37:02.400]  phone to saudi yeah but in 2003 in 2003 a youngest child died from a disease called diabetic
[1:37:02.400 --> 1:37:08.480]  ketoacidosis of texas children we had cps show up the next day oh god and they were actually
[1:37:08.480 --> 1:37:15.200]  trying to accuse us of child abuse and medical neglect something that was not in their control
[1:37:15.200 --> 1:37:20.000]  whatsoever sorry to hear about your child well listen i appreciate you and i appreciate the time
[1:37:20.000 --> 1:37:27.840]  yes sir we'll stay in contact oh god help me i can't handle it i can't handle these
[1:37:27.840 --> 1:37:33.120]  ravenous packs of wolves running around by the way i i wasn't even looking for it
[1:37:33.120 --> 1:37:40.480]  and i saw five articles this morning about cps workers and cps chiefs being child rapers i mean
[1:37:40.480 --> 1:37:50.320]  every day there is a pack of child raping demons no judge no jury no due process they just rule
[1:37:51.440 --> 1:37:55.600]  and every year they have to seize more children in the last to get their federal funds
[1:37:55.600 --> 1:38:00.320]  and the federal documents textbooks they say the family is the enemy it's all about breaking up the
[1:38:00.320 --> 1:38:07.840]  family to reduce population numbers under the eugenics protocol implemented in 1906 into federal
[1:38:07.840 --> 1:38:15.440]  register it's it's just all over oh god these people are just everywhere scum trash filth
[1:38:16.240 --> 1:38:23.920]  all of them oh man and i'm not kidding tens of thousands of american children flown out to israel
[1:38:23.920 --> 1:38:30.800]  and saudi arabia those are the two main ones where they're openly snuff filmed murdered tortured
[1:38:31.680 --> 1:38:36.880]  i mean just when they get uh where they're not sexually desirable to pedophiles anymore
[1:38:36.880 --> 1:38:42.240]  they fly them out to these different island chains where it's not just a sweat a sweat house
[1:38:42.240 --> 1:38:47.760]  sweatshop they actually chain them to the sewing machines that's just unbelievable
[1:38:49.120 --> 1:38:56.720]  your government's total fill i remember back in 2002 it was already over 3500 kids missing in
[1:38:56.720 --> 1:39:03.120]  florida they found some of them buried in shallow graves all over the u.s heads chopped off retroly
[1:39:03.120 --> 1:39:11.360]  murdered you can't even make this this stuff so insane i'm saying all this and it's like
[1:39:11.360 --> 1:39:17.360]  it sounds made up it's so nuts that i that i have an fbi training manual right here for the police
[1:39:17.360 --> 1:39:22.000]  that says if you encounter any of the following call the joint terrorism task force federal bureau
[1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:30.960]  investigation 201 east indian ola avenue phoenix arizona 85012 investigator al shearer and it says
[1:39:30.960 --> 1:39:35.200]  those that make frequent references the u.s constitution those that say they are quote
[1:39:35.200 --> 1:39:40.640]  defenders of the u.s constitution those that claim that driving is a right not a privilege
[1:39:44.400 --> 1:39:49.200]  says christian identity it says animal rights
[1:39:52.080 --> 1:39:53.040]  anti-abortion
[1:39:55.840 --> 1:40:00.320]  loan individuals and then i got worse manuals where they say wearing blue jeans and having a

[1:40:44.640 --> 1:40:48.720]  we are just scum oh i'm really having a moment of anger right now
[1:40:48.720 --> 1:40:56.800]  i can't get mad anymore i just i just can you imagine in this country that you teach a group
[1:40:56.800 --> 1:41:00.320]  of boy scouts that come to visit your college and you work for the administration
[1:41:02.000 --> 1:41:06.080]  that you got to defend the bill rights of constitution and that's your job as a cub scout
[1:41:06.080 --> 1:41:10.480]  as a boy scout which is what they taught when i was in there which is what he was taught just a
[1:41:10.480 --> 1:41:17.600]  standard speech and homeland security shows up and says you'll be arrested or worse if you ever
[1:41:17.600 --> 1:41:23.360]  talk like this again you're not allowed to talk like this in america boy you're not allowed i mean
[1:41:23.360 --> 1:41:27.920]  it'd be one thing if they said you're not allowed to talk about communism you know i'd say well i
[1:41:27.920 --> 1:41:32.800]  don't agree with communism and it's not his place to really be teaching kids that but you know that's
[1:41:32.800 --> 1:41:40.240]  your first amendment right no it wasn't that it was don't talk about freedom
[1:41:40.240 --> 1:41:49.040]  you can't make this type of stuff up okay i got a bunch of news here
[1:41:52.160 --> 1:41:59.280]  doctors condemn threatening taser court ruling i wanted to get into that because that dovetails
[1:41:59.280 --> 1:42:04.560]  with in new york they're saying that you're not allowed to ever bring up the second amendment
[1:42:04.560 --> 1:42:10.640]  in a court case they say that that is quote banned and of course we have feds and all these other
[1:42:10.640 --> 1:42:15.360]  hundreds of cases a famous one in denver saying that the constitution is not admissible in federal
[1:42:15.360 --> 1:42:26.160]  court just just like you can't talk about it uh to the boy scouts but i thought i would get to
[1:42:26.160 --> 1:42:36.640]  this for you first keeping kids in the classroom area school system tackling the issue with a focus
[1:42:36.640 --> 1:42:45.440]  on prevention and stronger enforcement i remember these are government training camps designed and
[1:42:45.440 --> 1:42:52.080]  chartered to dumb people down and teach them how to not read publicly of it we've had 30 plus guests
[1:42:52.080 --> 1:42:56.720]  on read the documents posted them sell books that are the size of phone books just full of government
[1:42:56.720 --> 1:43:02.320]  documents where it says their job they test to make sure they've done you down that's public
[1:43:03.760 --> 1:43:10.480]  but uh look at this keeping kids in the classroom area school system tackling the issue with a focus
[1:43:10.480 --> 1:43:17.440]  on prevention and stronger enforcement oh the problem of truancy has drawn widespread attention
[1:43:17.440 --> 1:43:22.400]  this year prompting some area lawmakers to call for tough measures to keep track of most habitual
[1:43:22.400 --> 1:43:28.560]  offenders and leading school officials officials not servants to crack down on those who constantly
[1:43:28.560 --> 1:43:35.600]  skip class it is recently concluded session the maryland general assembly passed a measure that
[1:43:35.600 --> 1:43:40.560]  would make it possible to deny driver's license to students who have too many unexcused absences
[1:43:40.560 --> 1:43:45.200]  you'll pay a fine even if you drop out of school it's all about controlling you governor martin
[1:43:45.200 --> 1:43:49.520]  o'Malley is expected to sign they're like aren't you for being educated going to school where you
[1:43:49.520 --> 1:43:54.080]  learn how to take riddling in prozac where you learn how to buy cocaine and where you learn how
[1:43:54.080 --> 1:43:59.280]  to be frisked by the cops don't you want to go to the filth pit so you can then go on to a college
[1:43:59.280 --> 1:44:04.000]  where they where the college is again a very small percentage less than 10 of it is just there's a
[1:44:04.000 --> 1:44:10.320]  school and the football team that's a facade for all the money laundering and drug dealing and bank
[1:44:10.320 --> 1:44:16.320]  owning and and sports team owning and radio network owning and that's who these people are
[1:44:17.280 --> 1:44:22.400]  ut it's not even real you understand it's a facade
[1:44:25.200 --> 1:44:28.960]  and they're getting ready to make their full move so they got homeland security out saying you don't
[1:44:28.960 --> 1:44:35.440]  teach boy scouts about freedom that's terrorism because the terrorists attacked us because they
[1:44:35.440 --> 1:44:41.920]  had our freedom and who hates our freedom the terrorist it's very simple they see they have
[1:44:41.920 --> 1:44:46.080]  little lawyer jokes to your face oh the terrorists did this because they want your freedom and that's
[1:44:46.080 --> 1:44:53.440]  exactly why the terrorists did it it's just the terrorists are them and it's recently concluded
[1:44:53.440 --> 1:44:56.960]  session the maryland general assembly passed a measure that would make it possible to deny
[1:44:56.960 --> 1:45:01.760]  driver's licenses students who have too many excuse absences during the same session lawmakers and

[1:45:22.560 --> 1:45:35.600]  george county uh 1500 students we posted the cnn newscast uh lined up at the courthouse with
[1:45:35.600 --> 1:45:42.160]  dogs and police in black riot gear barking with the parents saying yes it's the law we've got a

[1:45:47.200 --> 1:45:54.000]  it no judge no jury no summons no arrest just lying color of law fraudulent criminal announcements
[1:45:54.000 --> 1:45:59.680]  that it's the law that you have to take vaccines lined up being injected then i had the attorney
[1:45:59.680 --> 1:46:06.960]  on uh state attorney and i said uh oh uh there's no law yet to take this he goes you're right
[1:46:06.960 --> 1:46:11.520]  there's no law and my kids don't vaccinate and i said oh but you said it was the law there
[1:46:11.520 --> 1:46:19.520]  and he hemmed and hawed and and and sidestepped it you understand they had police dogs there it's
[1:46:19.520 --> 1:46:26.640]  all criminal it's all about conning you it's all about manipulating you those cops run to their
[1:46:26.640 --> 1:46:30.720]  own system of tyranny with their commanders over them they roll their sleeves up and they take

[1:54:21.680 --> 1:54:27.600]  cover to attack the public and enslave us on the false right paradigm attack and on the false
[1:54:27.600 --> 1:54:33.120]  left paradigm pincer they use global warming which they openly say carbon is the devil weapon
[1:54:33.120 --> 1:54:39.120]  carbon dioxide which humans exhale therefore we're the enemy official cfr documents that
[1:54:39.120 --> 1:54:45.440]  everybody bought into the fad gibbering and giggling like moron monkeys doesn't just don't

[1:55:10.960 --> 1:55:19.280]  an incredible article uh with prince philip when it says nazi collaborator and racist advocate
[1:55:19.280 --> 1:55:24.640]  who says blacks aren't human but that's okay a mass genocide prince philip a man who has often
[1:55:24.640 --> 1:55:28.960]  expressed his desire to return to the earth as a deadly virus to thin the human population by
[1:55:28.960 --> 1:55:34.400]  80% says there are too many people in the world as he attacked large families in a television
[1:55:34.400 --> 1:55:40.080]  interview set for air this week the duke says that curbing family size must be the best means
[1:55:40.080 --> 1:55:45.120]  of keeping a soaring cost of stable food products so see they artificially depress the food supply
[1:55:45.120 --> 1:55:49.680]  and then say oh there's too many humans so that's that's the talking point you see al gore doing that
[1:55:50.400 --> 1:55:55.600]  such as bread and rice in check reported in london times food prizes are going up he tells the
[1:55:55.600 --> 1:56:02.080]  interviewer sir trevor mcdonald everyone thinks it's to do with not enough food but it's really
[1:56:02.080 --> 1:56:08.080]  that demand is too great too many people basically it's a little embarrassing for everybody no one
[1:56:08.080 --> 1:56:12.800]  quite knows how to handle it nobody wants their family life to be interfered with by the government
[1:56:12.800 --> 1:56:18.160]  we have to and then it's got all these incredible quotes where he says we've got to kill everybody
[1:56:18.160 --> 1:56:23.760]  you can go read them and it's got photos of him with the hitler and everybody else and see my
[1:56:23.760 --> 1:56:28.720]  whole point is whoever's running this eugenics we need to fight it i mean we know the new order
[1:56:28.720 --> 1:56:34.080]  today isn't what you'd call the original nazis i'm i've always said the nazis were a sub brand a
[1:56:34.080 --> 1:56:40.000]  sub spin-off they're obsessed with race the zionists are obsessed with race they're all obsessed with
[1:56:40.000 --> 1:56:45.440]  breeding and whose family they're from the point is they're attacking us black white old young
[1:56:46.000 --> 1:56:50.960]  mexican chinese it doesn't matter folks you're under attack by these people you can be a white
[1:56:50.960 --> 1:56:57.840]  guy in east texas or a black guy in north carolina and we just better realize this is the issue i mean
[1:56:57.840 --> 1:57:02.960]  the hitler lovers out there can't even fight eugenics because they're too busy saying hitler was a
[1:57:02.960 --> 1:57:09.520]  good guy who got a raw deal hey man all i know is prince philip admits he admired hitler and uh
[1:57:09.520 --> 1:57:13.680]  wants to carry out eugenics against us i mean while you're busy loving dove and with hitler over
[1:57:13.680 --> 1:57:19.200]  there you better realize you better not take that shot because i guess uh the the guys at the hospital
[1:57:19.200 --> 1:57:28.480]  didn't get the memo that you were white so you don't get the cancer injection just please get on
[1:57:28.480 --> 1:57:34.480]  the real issues i'm begging you out there man we don't have time we got to warn everybody
[1:57:36.400 --> 1:57:40.800]  he goes on overlooking the fact that prince philip himself as four children and eight grandchildren
[1:57:40.800 --> 1:57:46.880]  the article counts as his comments in the fallacy that his royal highness is a eco warrior a completely
[1:57:46.880 --> 1:57:51.520]  fails to point out the duke of edinburgh's enthusiasm for calling human herd actually stems from his
[1:57:51.520 --> 1:57:59.520]  warped advocacy of eugenics and the royal commission on population by his uh the father of his wife the
[1:57:59.520 --> 1:58:05.280]  king of england prince uh queen elizabeth's father says it's not about population of the earth it is
[1:58:05.280 --> 1:58:11.760]  about economic warfare as the alex jones documents in his seminal documentary in game the mindset is
[1:58:11.760 --> 1:58:17.040]  in game amongst the elite is and is endemic prince philip zeal within the population of
[1:58:17.040 --> 1:58:25.040]  undesirables has little to do with his so-called green credentials as is falsely argued we'll
[1:58:25.040 --> 1:58:34.160]  be right back ladies and gentlemen this affects every one of you thank you for listening to gcn

[2:00:00.640 --> 2:00:08.960]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[2:00:08.960 --> 2:00:17.280]  continuing with scumbag prince philip prince philip zeal to thin the population of undesirables
[2:00:17.280 --> 2:00:21.520]  has little to do with his so-called green credentials as he is
[2:00:23.920 --> 2:00:28.000]  fraudulently argued by the corporate media in reality the duke of edinburgh was a
[2:00:28.000 --> 2:00:33.760]  nazi collaborator and his racist tendencies have spilled over into public affairs in many
[2:00:33.760 --> 2:00:39.760]  occasions now every time i bash eugenics we can't have a eugenics discussion because it turns out
[2:00:39.760 --> 2:00:44.800]  that i'm bashing germans my my much of my family's german i'm not bashing germans that's how you've
[2:00:44.800 --> 2:00:50.080]  been mentally programmed not be able to address issues you've been even in your own movement
[2:00:50.080 --> 2:00:54.000]  been programmed to not be able to address serious things my point is it's not even a
[2:00:54.000 --> 2:00:59.680]  british family it is a german royal family and he's a nazi and i mean that you know the the
[2:00:59.680 --> 2:01:06.080]  head of the house of orange another nazi the founder of the belterberg group uh that's prince
[2:01:06.080 --> 2:01:11.040]  Bernhardt this is who we're dealing with and and they're carrying out eugenics they picked up at
[2:01:11.040 --> 2:01:18.000]  england in the us so that's as far as the nazi angle and connection goes and i'm just addressing
[2:01:18.000 --> 2:01:21.440]  that some listeners are going what is he talking about you don't understand folks there's mentally
[2:01:21.440 --> 2:01:25.760]  ill members of the population that think eugenics is good and they think it's for the you know just
[2:01:25.760 --> 2:01:30.640]  for other groups not for them and or they don't think it's a real issue because the germans don't
[2:01:30.640 --> 2:01:37.920]  have power and nazis didn't exist or are good and are you know giving us a little prizes under our
[2:01:37.920 --> 2:01:45.600]  pillows at night uh well prince phillips bad as alex jones documents in a similar documentary
[2:01:45.600 --> 2:01:52.240]  film in game this mindset is endemic again uh amongst the elite prince phillips zeal within
[2:01:52.240 --> 2:01:57.920]  the population of undesirables has little to do with his so-called green credentials as is
[2:01:58.640 --> 2:02:02.880]  argued in the corporate media in reality the duke of edinburgh was a nazi collaborator
[2:02:02.880 --> 2:02:08.320]  and his racist tendencies have spilled over into public gaps in many occasions got a link to that
[2:02:08.320 --> 2:02:13.280]  in 86 for example the queen's husband remarked a british student during a visit to china if you
[2:02:13.280 --> 2:02:19.680]  stay here much longer you will go home with slitty eyes just and they're also so imbred they're
[2:02:19.680 --> 2:02:27.360]  basically mentally retarded the so-called the leader a bunch of degenerate weak trash so sick of
[2:02:27.360 --> 2:02:35.040]  them he goes on it looks as though it was put in by an indian he went on phillips served when he
[2:02:35.040 --> 2:02:42.480]  saw a messy fuse box in a factory during a 99 visit it was well documented that prince phillips
[2:02:42.480 --> 2:02:50.240]  sister sophia was married to christopher of hess castle a ss kernel who named his eldest son carol
[2:02:50.240 --> 2:02:55.600]  adolf and hitler's honor indeed all four of phillips sisters married high-ranking nazis well
[2:02:55.600 --> 2:03:01.040]  they were german what do you expect the prospect of the former nazis and nazi sympathizers uh attending
[2:03:01.040 --> 2:03:06.720]  his 47 wedding to the future queen of england man he was not allowed to and he was only allowed to
[2:03:06.720 --> 2:03:12.880]  invite two guests and then it goes on two years ago more revelations of phillips and nazi links
[2:03:12.880 --> 2:03:18.880]  emerged in a book that featured never before published photos of phillip age 16 to 1937 funeral
[2:03:18.880 --> 2:03:25.200]  of his elder sister flanked by relatives in ss and brown shirt uniforms another picture shows his
[2:03:25.200 --> 2:03:32.880]  youngest sister sophia sitting opposite hitler at the wedding of uh herman gearing and it goes on
[2:03:32.880 --> 2:03:38.640]  um phillip was forced to concede that his family found hitler's appetite to restore germany's power
[2:03:38.640 --> 2:03:45.120]  and prestige attractive and admitted they had inhibitions about the jews the duke was also
[2:03:45.120 --> 2:03:51.840]  trained in the hitler youth it goes on phillip alt but of course the truth is britain actually set
[2:03:51.840 --> 2:03:56.800]  hitler up told him to invade that's why he let the british evacuate at duncork that's why when
[2:03:56.800 --> 2:04:02.240]  rudolf hess flew over and said we have a deal to do this they held him for decades and had a
[2:04:02.240 --> 2:04:06.720]  prison by himself and it all came out that it was all staged and that's in mainline history books
[2:04:06.720 --> 2:04:11.360]  that they literally set hitler up ladies and gentlemen but see you want to worship hitler
[2:04:11.360 --> 2:04:16.640]  you don't want to admit that he was a weak chicken neck completely set up by the globalists who were
[2:04:16.640 --> 2:04:26.880]  10 steps ahead of you you'd rather be weak and let them always win don't worry though all of you

[2:35:52.080 --> 2:35:58.960]  out the bread made a very nice banner um no carbon tax at the scam and uh then we talked to the
[2:35:58.960 --> 2:36:04.800]  people coming out and even talked to a few reporters um and that's really all i can remember
[2:36:04.800 --> 2:36:11.600]  right now on the gore event now tell me about the little brainwashed slaves of death that's
[2:36:11.600 --> 2:36:16.720]  what they are they they they love prince phillip who love dead black babies and dead latin american
[2:36:16.720 --> 2:36:21.360]  babies and love their mommy dying of engineered cancer tell me about the lovers of death tell
[2:36:21.360 --> 2:36:26.720]  me about their weakness yeah they showed up to a public event uh that they just wanted to watch
[2:36:26.720 --> 2:36:30.800]  tv you know you interrupt al gore and like shut up you know i'm watching this tv here it's all
[2:36:30.800 --> 2:36:37.200]  about them feeling like they're part of something big mm-hmm yeah they uh they feel real important
[2:36:37.200 --> 2:36:41.840]  uh i didn't know they said i didn't know they stacked excrement that high but tell me what else
[2:36:41.840 --> 2:36:47.440]  they were doing well uh you know when inside there uh they're telling us to shut up and what not
[2:36:48.000 --> 2:36:53.360]  um they didn't like us interrupting their god uh then outside uh there's a few of them just
[2:36:53.360 --> 2:36:57.760]  didn't want to hear it you know they had his bs and then they'd hop on their bikes and pedal away
[2:36:58.800 --> 2:37:02.640]  there's nothing wrong with bikes there's nothing wrong with with getting out of the mall culture
[2:37:02.640 --> 2:37:07.280]  but the globalist designed us as a sprawling based on the automobile and now they're going to
[2:37:07.280 --> 2:37:12.080]  cheat us and choke us and wreck our economy and bring in total control in their own admission
[2:37:12.080 --> 2:37:17.200]  i mean i saw you out there that huge sign saying no carbon tax did you explain to the idiots that
[2:37:17.200 --> 2:37:22.640]  i noticed you did that hey carbon dioxide's good this covers up for all the real environmental
[2:37:22.640 --> 2:37:29.840]  issues oh yeah yeah and uh in fact uh they mentioned that to us several times and uh in the video
[2:37:29.840 --> 2:37:34.400]  you can actually see me tell a guy it's like a magician trick they take all the real pollutants
[2:37:34.400 --> 2:37:40.080]  like mercury and lead and they hide that behind their back and they say well they bring out with
[2:37:40.080 --> 2:37:43.200]  their other hand say well here's the bad thing it's the carbon dioxide that's hurting you
[2:37:45.280 --> 2:37:49.440]  see that's what makes me even matter is that we have real environmental problems and it's hurting
[2:37:49.440 --> 2:37:55.200]  us i mean i care about the earth but forget the earth it's hurting me we're all interconnected
[2:37:55.200 --> 2:38:00.480]  and they're doing stuff you just it's it's irreversibly bad i mean they've done it's just so
[2:38:00.480 --> 2:38:05.280]  out of and in meanwhile they got all these idiots calling for global government and a global tax
[2:38:05.280 --> 2:38:09.280]  well i just commend you he's getting confronted everywhere he looked like he got upset when you
[2:38:09.280 --> 2:38:14.800]  spoke up to him uh yeah i think he stumbled a little bit he was a little distracted uh
[2:38:15.440 --> 2:38:22.720]  when i interrupted him yeah he wanted to continue preaching to his flock there is there a we are

[2:39:39.920 --> 2:39:48.960]  uh it's so ridiculous to carbon down i mean i just but again it's a sick joke with these people

[2:39:58.160 --> 2:40:01.760]  of the film but it's 9 11 chronicles part one truth rising the short title truth rising
[2:40:03.200 --> 2:40:07.040]  every film i make i say this is the best but if you watch them each one just gets better
[2:40:07.040 --> 2:40:14.160]  uh but this really is uh different i mean and it is the best i've made entertainment wise i mean
[2:40:14.160 --> 2:40:19.920]  it's also very informative i mean we spend 20 minutes of the two hours on how they blew up the
[2:40:19.920 --> 2:40:24.960]  towers and how was an inside job it's an incredible eyewitness testimony emergency workers and others
[2:40:24.960 --> 2:40:32.880]  but uh not just that it's it's it's david rockefeller and zebignan brzezinski and larry silverstein
[2:40:32.880 --> 2:40:39.920]  and bill clinton and hillary and john mccain and barack obama and uh all of them i mean it
[2:40:39.920 --> 2:40:46.080]  arnold's forzenegger all of them being confronted instead of watching some cruddy youtube video
[2:40:46.080 --> 2:40:50.960]  i mean this is high quality big screen with stuff you've never seen in high-deaf footage we shot in
[2:40:50.960 --> 2:40:55.840]  new york in the last three years of remembrances there and emergency workers and what the dust
[2:40:55.840 --> 2:41:00.160]  really did and their trip to washington try to get health care and that being blocked and
[2:41:00.160 --> 2:41:04.480]  that we are change funded i mean these are kids running this that literally live in one room
[2:41:04.480 --> 2:41:10.000]  apartments and wear the same shirt all week and they raised all this money and paid for it and then
[2:41:10.000 --> 2:41:16.000]  they were about to get it passed in washington they just said no funding um the fight goes on i mean

[2:45:10.360 --> 2:45:16.160]  Now let's go ahead and go to G. Edward Griffin, he'll be with us and I appreciate him holding
[2:45:16.160 --> 2:45:20.000]  the last five minutes, he'll be with us until the end of the show today and I thought we'd
[2:45:20.000 --> 2:45:26.400]  do a part two and mainly take calls and talk more about solutions today but with all the
[2:45:26.400 --> 2:45:31.280]  things happening in the news, the fake election, the three stage candidates, I thought I'd
[2:45:31.280 --> 2:45:36.240]  bring up that not to cover it because it's a distraction but to use it as a learning
[2:45:36.240 --> 2:45:41.760]  module to see how they stage events so I thought out of the first curveball I'd throw him would
[2:45:41.760 --> 2:45:47.720]  be getting his take on Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and John McCain and to get his take
[2:45:47.720 --> 2:45:50.520]  on this whole exercise and futility.
[2:45:50.520 --> 2:45:55.080]  We had so much fun when he was in a few weeks ago in studio and he had to talk to a packed
[2:45:55.080 --> 2:45:58.360]  house UT that I wanted to have him back up sooner.
[2:45:58.360 --> 2:45:59.880]  Mr. Griffin, thanks for coming on with us.
[2:45:59.880 --> 2:46:01.880]  Well, Alex, thanks, it's good to be here.
[2:46:01.880 --> 2:46:04.080]  Did you get a nice response coming on last time?
[2:46:04.080 --> 2:46:09.760]  Oh, yes indeed, my boy, you really cover the waterfront here and we got a response, they're
[2:46:09.760 --> 2:46:13.080]  still coming in from that and I appreciate that so much.
[2:46:13.080 --> 2:46:19.960]  Oh no, that's our job is to try to find people that are realistic, focused and serious, in
[2:46:19.960 --> 2:46:24.080]  some cases more so than me because I just can't handle it anymore, I flip out sometimes
[2:46:24.080 --> 2:46:28.960]  and try to push people to good places where they can move forward and I always like how
[2:46:28.960 --> 2:46:30.160]  you're classy.
[2:46:30.160 --> 2:46:35.320]  Have you seen the disease in our movement, how over time most people turn into backstabbers
[2:46:35.320 --> 2:46:40.160]  who are about egos and who the big dog is on the block instead of realizing we're on
[2:46:40.160 --> 2:46:44.080]  a ship in very treacherous waters in an emergency situation?
[2:46:44.080 --> 2:46:49.400]  Yes, I have noticed that Alex and I don't know whether that's peculiar to our movement,
[2:46:49.400 --> 2:46:56.200]  but I think not, it's probably peculiar to any group of people who get together and they
[2:46:56.200 --> 2:47:02.280]  start off all in lockstep, they got the same goals, same ideas and then they kind of learn
[2:47:02.280 --> 2:47:06.960]  about each other and their different views and they start to pick at each other and then
[2:47:06.960 --> 2:47:10.320]  they're in a massive war as to who is right and who is wrong.
[2:47:10.320 --> 2:47:14.640]  It's very destructive, we need to stay focused on key issues, we can stop like the fact that
[2:47:14.640 --> 2:47:17.600]  global warming is a global carbon tax fraud.
[2:47:17.600 --> 2:47:25.920]  But before we get into the election, since I raised that point, people say Ron Paul is
[2:47:25.920 --> 2:47:30.400]  a blood drinking mason, their proof is that he spoke at Harvard or something and there
[2:47:30.400 --> 2:47:35.960]  was a masonic seal behind him where he spoke and that he doesn't bash masons when that's
[2:47:35.960 --> 2:47:40.400]  a huge constituency and most masons aren't bad and they're compartmentalized and don't
[2:47:40.400 --> 2:47:45.640]  realize that the higher levels it has been used for the program, but I don't know, there's
[2:47:45.640 --> 2:47:50.840]  a masonic seal in one speech he gave of thousands, it's all over, Ron Paul's a devil and I won't
[2:47:50.840 --> 2:47:54.560]  expose him for being a devil now, so I'm evil too, G. Edward Griffin.
[2:47:54.560 --> 2:48:00.760]  Yeah, well, I think you and I are in the same team, I don't know whether Ron Paul is a mason
[2:48:00.760 --> 2:48:05.280]  or not, I doubt it very much, but even if he were, I don't think he would be one of
[2:48:05.280 --> 2:48:11.880]  those guys that we're concerned about at the top, 33 degree or higher, your point is so
[2:48:11.880 --> 2:48:18.440]  well taken that 99% of the masons, at least the ones I know are just good old boys and
[2:48:18.440 --> 2:48:25.520]  they have no concept of the history of the lodges and the origins in Europe.
[2:48:25.520 --> 2:48:30.840]  And that helps the New World Order when people unfairly attack all masons and say, you're
[2:48:30.840 --> 2:48:35.880]  worshiping Bathomat, they haven't read Albert Pike, they haven't read Morals and Dogma,
[2:48:35.880 --> 2:48:39.840]  they haven't read Manly P. Hall and so they think these people are nuts, they're saying
[2:48:39.840 --> 2:48:43.680]  I'm a devil worshipper and instead of approaching them and saying, did you see this, did you
[2:48:43.680 --> 2:48:48.000]  know this, again, you aid the evil by being off the hook nuts.
[2:48:48.000 --> 2:48:54.080]  Yeah, well, you know, I think that the ugly reality, Alex, is that our enemies are very
[2:48:54.080 --> 2:48:58.400]  well aware of this tendency and I think they fuel it.
[2:48:58.400 --> 2:49:04.160]  I think there are a jamb provocateurs in our midst whose sole job is to get our people
[2:49:04.160 --> 2:49:08.560]  going down the wrong track and it's unfortunately, it's pretty easy at times.
[2:49:08.560 --> 2:49:13.160]  Oh, it's been admitted and that's what, the only reason I raise this is, is that it is
[2:49:13.160 --> 2:49:19.280]  the popular thing to attack me and make stuff up, it's all made up and it isn't that I individually
[2:49:19.280 --> 2:49:23.400]  care about being attacked, frankly folks, I actually like it in a sick way, that's the
[2:49:23.400 --> 2:49:27.720]  kind of aggressive person I am, it makes me sick at an intellectual level because we're
[2:49:27.720 --> 2:49:32.320]  in a desperate situation, we've got to use every ounce of our energy to stay focused
[2:49:32.320 --> 2:49:38.000]  on real issues and to wake the public up to the general basics instead of automatically
[2:49:38.000 --> 2:49:44.000]  arguing with them about the secret triumphant of, you know, the Getty's, the Pope and Sherlock
[2:49:44.000 --> 2:49:48.960]  Holmes, I mean, sarcastic, I mean, we've, I mean, I'd like you to speak on that, we're
[2:49:48.960 --> 2:49:52.080]  about to go to break and then on the election and then whatever you want to talk about.
[2:49:52.080 --> 2:49:59.200]  Okay, very good, well, like our last session together, Alex, I find that with the way you
[2:49:59.200 --> 2:50:03.560]  pose the question to me and you cover the topic so well that there's not much for me
[2:50:03.560 --> 2:50:11.720]  to say except, yeah, what you said, you say it so well, but you do, I watch the interview
[2:50:11.720 --> 2:50:13.600]  later, you're much more eloquent than I am, but go ahead.
[2:50:13.600 --> 2:50:17.720]  Well, I don't know about that, but anyway, I start off by saying, yes, I agree in my
[2:50:17.720 --> 2:50:25.680]  own thoughts are, I just repeat that I know that our enemies are out there dumping garbage
[2:50:25.680 --> 2:50:31.080]  into the grocery basket, knowing that a little bad smell here and there will convince people
[2:50:31.080 --> 2:50:35.000]  that the whole basket is nothing but garbage and they walk away from it.
[2:50:35.000 --> 2:50:37.920]  We see that all the time, especially in the 9-11 truth movement.
[2:50:37.920 --> 2:50:38.920]  Stay there.
[2:50:38.920 --> 2:50:39.920]  Let's talk about it.
[2:50:39.920 --> 2:50:40.920]  Yeah.
[2:50:40.920 --> 2:50:44.160]  Now they're running around with signs saying we staged terror attacks, wearing Hitler
[2:50:44.160 --> 2:50:49.120]  moustaches with international news crews with them, all staged.
[2:50:49.120 --> 2:50:57.080]  It is a big idea, a new world order in the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful
[2:50:57.080 --> 2:50:58.080]  world government.
[2:50:58.080 --> 2:51:03.880]  It's known as the Bilderberg, but their objective being world domination.
[2:51:03.880 --> 2:51:07.040]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[2:51:07.040 --> 2:51:12.960]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
[2:51:12.960 --> 2:51:17.400]  of humanity is at hand.
[2:51:17.400 --> 2:51:22.440]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[2:51:22.440 --> 2:51:26.680]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[2:51:26.680 --> 2:51:29.440]  Bilderberg is making great progress for the world government.
[2:51:29.440 --> 2:51:32.560]  Most people have no idea, they're not after money, they have all the money they need.
[2:51:32.560 --> 2:51:33.560]  They're after power.
[2:51:33.560 --> 2:51:34.560]  That's their affidavit.

[2:51:43.200 --> 2:51:44.200]  You have been warned.
[2:51:44.200 --> 2:51:53.320]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of
[2:51:53.320 --> 2:51:58.280]  disease such as cancer or diabetes, acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat,
[2:51:58.280 --> 2:52:01.600]  what we drink, the environment and our high stress lifestyles.
[2:52:01.600 --> 2:52:05.720]  It's these choices that cause decreased energy, weight gain and eventually disease.
[2:52:05.720 --> 2:52:10.200]  The easiest way to reduce disease causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized
[2:52:10.200 --> 2:52:11.200]  water.
[2:52:11.200 --> 2:52:15.680]  At SnyderHealth.com we offer a full line of alkaline water ionizers from Jupiter Science,
[2:52:15.680 --> 2:52:19.800]  the leader in water ionization technology for over 25 years.
[2:52:19.800 --> 2:52:25.320]  They transform ordinary tap water into clean, living, energized water containing alkaline
[2:52:25.320 --> 2:52:29.640]  minerals, disease fighting antioxidants and highly absorbable oxygen.
[2:52:29.640 --> 2:52:33.560]  Now you can easily and effectively rid your body of harmful acidic waste with alkaline
[2:52:33.560 --> 2:52:34.960]  ionized water.

[2:52:48.680 --> 2:52:52.960]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water and did you know that you
[2:52:52.960 --> 2:52:57.160]  have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the
[2:52:57.160 --> 2:52:58.160]  water?
[2:52:58.160 --> 2:53:01.480]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed
[2:53:01.480 --> 2:53:02.640]  into the skin.
[2:53:02.640 --> 2:53:07.320]  The KDF dual media shower filter works with both hot and cold water and is designed to

[2:53:12.840 --> 2:53:14.160]  algae and fungus.
[2:53:14.160 --> 2:53:19.000]  The KDF dual media shower filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year whichever
[2:53:19.000 --> 2:53:20.000]  comes first.
[2:53:20.000 --> 2:53:24.200]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine,
[2:53:24.200 --> 2:53:26.280]  iron, heavy metals and bacteria.

[2:54:28.000 --> 2:54:33.040]  G. Edward Griffin is our guest, Freedom Force International, we'll be opening up the phones
[2:54:33.040 --> 2:54:41.000]  next hour at 1-800-259-9231 also this fourth hour as always, there's going to be a simulcast
[2:54:41.000 --> 2:54:50.000]  of the television on the web for PrisonPlanet.TV viewers, also it goes out in what is it, 64k
[2:54:50.000 --> 2:54:56.000]  or 56, better audio I know that, PrisonPlanet.TV.
[2:54:56.000 --> 2:55:02.120]  G. Edward, you're very gentle, very intelligent, very calm about this, I know we talked last
[2:55:02.120 --> 2:55:06.640]  time about how I tend to freak out and you said when you were younger you would, it's
[2:55:06.640 --> 2:55:10.880]  just they're so diabolical, they're so evil, they're doing so many bad things.
[2:55:10.880 --> 2:55:16.120]  I just panic, I want people to stop them, I want to fight them and I know that you've
[2:55:16.120 --> 2:55:21.320]  got an approach to do that but continuing with how they try to get us to run off rabbit
[2:55:21.320 --> 2:55:25.560]  trails to where the general public when they first hear what we're talking about thinks
[2:55:25.560 --> 2:55:30.640]  we're talking gibberish instead of putting the basics out to people, speak to that then
[2:55:30.640 --> 2:55:34.840]  to the election, then to solutions, what you think of the food shortages, anything you
[2:55:34.840 --> 2:55:35.840]  want to talk about.
[2:55:35.840 --> 2:55:43.440]  Well, I think probably the most common example that everybody would recognize in this business
[2:55:43.440 --> 2:55:49.200]  of sending us down rabbit trails, anybody that spends any time at all on their email
[2:55:49.200 --> 2:55:55.440]  inbox knows that about every, I guess about every five or six weeks, we get an alert from
[2:55:55.440 --> 2:55:59.840]  somebody out there, we never heard of this person before but this alert that stand by
[2:55:59.840 --> 2:56:03.720]  everybody listen to this, you got to read this, this is urgent, tell all your friends
[2:56:03.720 --> 2:56:09.900]  inside source, a reliable source tells us that next Tuesday is the big day for an atomic
[2:56:09.900 --> 2:56:16.760]  attack against an American city or standby on May 14th, we know this for certain now,
[2:56:16.760 --> 2:56:22.560]  May 14th is the day they're going to unleash a bacteriological attack in Chicago and tell
[2:56:22.560 --> 2:56:26.440]  your friends, you know, the sort of thing, you get that about every six weeks and who
[2:56:26.440 --> 2:56:31.080]  are these people, where does this come from, you know, this doesn't just happen, this is
[2:56:31.080 --> 2:56:38.320]  manufactured stuff and the whole purpose is to get Johnny Gullible to go along and send
[2:56:38.320 --> 2:56:41.720]  it to all of his friends because he's really concerned, you know, he thinks this could
[2:56:41.720 --> 2:56:46.200]  be the real thing and God knows it could be the real thing at some day, so they got you
[2:56:46.200 --> 2:56:50.600]  there, you know, but he sends it to all of his friends and they get excited and then
[2:56:50.600 --> 2:56:54.920]  the date comes and passes and they think, well, so much for Johnny, he's just a jerk,
[2:56:54.920 --> 2:56:55.920]  you know, he's not.
[2:56:55.920 --> 2:57:00.320]  And that way of a real warning ever comes out, people would have heard Wolfcrout so
[2:57:00.320 --> 2:57:04.920]  much they won't take action and that way people never do take action because it's all the
[2:57:04.920 --> 2:57:11.120]  world's always ending next week instead of it's ongoing tyranny, martial law isn't coming,
[2:57:11.120 --> 2:57:13.840]  we're already in to a certain degree of it, go ahead.
[2:57:13.840 --> 2:57:17.300]  Well, that's right and then people ask me all the time, when do you think the new world
[2:57:17.300 --> 2:57:22.200]  order is going to be here and I look at them, I said, come on Charlie, it's already here,
[2:57:22.200 --> 2:57:26.480]  it's just that every day they build a wall a little bit higher and it's been here for
[2:57:26.480 --> 2:57:31.000]  quite a while, so it's not going to be a day when they ring the bell or you're going
[2:57:31.000 --> 2:57:35.880]  to read headlines in your newspapers, the new world order arrived today at noon and
[2:57:35.880 --> 2:57:37.680]  the ceremony was, you know, so forth.
[2:57:37.680 --> 2:57:42.760]  Yeah, you're quite right, Alex, it's here and it's creeping, gradualism and we get
[2:57:42.760 --> 2:57:48.200]  used to it and they try to get everybody numb to it so that they just don't know what to
[2:57:48.200 --> 2:57:49.960]  do, don't feel like doing anything.
[2:57:49.960 --> 2:57:54.280]  So it's an obvious ploy, but what you do about it, I'm not quite sure, you just have
[2:57:54.280 --> 2:57:57.480]  to be aware and be very, very cautious.
[2:57:57.480 --> 2:58:02.640]  I saw something last night, I was going over stuff to go into our unfiltered news weekly
[2:58:02.640 --> 2:58:10.480]  service and I saw something about, somebody had a photograph of a chem trail plane, I
[2:58:10.480 --> 2:58:15.360]  said, it was on the ground, boy that looked convincing to me and they had pictures of
[2:58:15.360 --> 2:58:19.240]  the pods there and everything that looked at that, wait a minute, where did this come
[2:58:19.240 --> 2:58:24.000]  from, who is this guy, what do we know about that, what is this plane, do I know anything
[2:58:24.000 --> 2:58:25.000]  about it?
[2:58:25.000 --> 2:58:30.240]  Stay there, let's talk more about it on the other side.

[3:00:12.960 --> 3:00:16.920]  on the infowars.com stream should go over there and be able to hear the behind the scenes
[3:00:16.920 --> 3:00:17.920]  stuff.
[3:00:17.920 --> 3:00:22.200]  G. Edward Griffin, we're going to give out his website at Freedom Force International,
[3:00:22.200 --> 3:00:27.400]  how to get involved, great guy, we've been around for well since 1959, fighting the new
[3:00:27.400 --> 3:00:32.360]  world order, bestselling author, I mean without getting too sidetracked into this but I think
[3:00:32.360 --> 3:00:36.840]  it's important to have discussions about this sometime, he'll be the same guy who
[3:00:36.840 --> 3:00:42.640]  comes out with fake Amaro coins, who later comes out as a known FBI operative hooked
[3:00:42.640 --> 3:00:46.000]  in with Sean Hannity and then he'll come out and say there was a secret session of
[3:00:46.000 --> 3:00:50.640]  Congress where other groups will put out, oh Nacera, the government's secretly good
[3:00:50.640 --> 3:00:56.400]  and everything's fine or Leo Wanta got trillions of dollars and he's good but only trust him,
[3:00:56.400 --> 3:01:00.560]  everyone else secretly works for the Pope and you can always tell these government things,
[3:01:00.560 --> 3:01:06.640]  they're designed for the lowest common denominator and to get you know idiot camp followers to
[3:01:06.640 --> 3:01:11.200]  kind of go along with it instead of saying we can work together, we're positive, you
[3:01:11.200 --> 3:01:15.640]  know the average person's good, it's evil at the top, we can affect change and we need
[3:01:15.640 --> 3:01:20.400]  to stop the collectivist, you notice that these groups that are government operatives,
[3:01:20.400 --> 3:01:25.320]  they never are issue specific, they never get into how things work or about what the
[3:01:25.320 --> 3:01:29.480]  government's doing or what the corporations are doing, it's always about what other patriots
[3:01:29.480 --> 3:01:34.120]  are doing and that's why I've been trying to wake up people to stop being part of this
[3:01:34.120 --> 3:01:37.840]  bellicose mental illness, do you see what I'm saying, do you ever griffon?
[3:01:37.840 --> 3:01:43.120]  Yeah absolutely and I'm very grateful that there is a voice such as yours Alex that
[3:01:43.120 --> 3:01:48.520]  is such a strong voice, heard by so many people that's preaching common sense on this because
[3:01:48.520 --> 3:01:52.400]  you know this has been going on for a long time, you mentioned I've been in this battle
[3:01:52.400 --> 3:01:57.840]  more or less it's about 1959 and this was going on even then believe it or not but
[3:01:57.840 --> 3:02:04.040]  unfortunately back in those days that there was no real strong voice against it that reached
[3:02:04.040 --> 3:02:09.200]  very many people and people fell for it, all the patriots fell for it which is I think
[3:02:09.200 --> 3:02:13.720]  one of the reasons that nothing really developed over the years in the way of a strong counter
[3:02:13.720 --> 3:02:19.320]  force against this so they were divided against each other, they fell for all of these ploys
[3:02:19.320 --> 3:02:23.640]  and so we see the result of it today but thank God you're out there telling the truth today
[3:02:23.640 --> 3:02:27.800]  and we're trying to do the same thing with Freedom Force International so maybe this
[3:02:27.800 --> 3:02:34.760]  time around we'll have a little better shot at it, this is really a war for the brain
[3:02:34.760 --> 3:02:35.760]  is it not?
[3:02:35.760 --> 3:02:36.760]  It is.
[3:02:36.760 --> 3:02:45.320]  Yeah, always behind that veiled fist or that velvet fist or the glove I should say behind
[3:02:45.320 --> 3:02:49.560]  the glove is the fist, I'll finally get it out right here but yeah there's always the
[3:02:49.560 --> 3:02:55.760]  threat of physical force and coercion but really the greatest strides that our opponents
[3:02:55.760 --> 3:03:00.600]  have made in capturing the American people and in other countries as well is by capturing
[3:03:00.600 --> 3:03:07.680]  their brains to capture their minds, their information flow, they engineer their opinions
[3:03:07.680 --> 3:03:14.160]  and this is how they control people today and so we have to be alert to that and have
[3:03:14.160 --> 3:03:22.320]  strong leaders that can help us to weed through these rough paths and find out which are the
[3:03:22.320 --> 3:03:27.720]  stepping stones that are safe and which ones are dangerous and that's the battle we have
[3:03:27.720 --> 3:03:28.720]  today.
[3:03:28.720 --> 3:03:34.960]  Now the establishment is trying to focus though in on organized groups and websites and authors
[3:03:34.960 --> 3:03:40.720]  and attacking networks and things like that but overall the loss of confidence in the
[3:03:40.720 --> 3:03:47.400]  state and in the organized system, the top down hierarchical structure is so massive
[3:03:47.400 --> 3:03:53.040]  and people are becoming more and more distrustful that I'm intellectually pretty sure that the
[3:03:53.040 --> 3:03:57.440]  elite is in for some very rough times themselves and of course they've foreseen that and tried
[3:03:57.440 --> 3:04:03.200]  to build up a oppressive grid to counter that and they've written about how they foresaw
[3:04:03.200 --> 3:04:08.280]  it but I think the wave of resistance is so big that they've got a crisis of conscience
[3:04:08.280 --> 3:04:12.440]  themselves and even their own minions are saying do I want to be part of this?
[3:04:12.440 --> 3:04:15.360]  Yeah, I think they're quite right but they're committed.
[3:04:15.360 --> 3:04:19.640]  I don't think the guys at the top are going to have any option to turning around.
[3:04:19.640 --> 3:04:20.640]  They're committed.
[3:04:20.640 --> 3:04:25.040]  So they're not going to back down and I think the only hope we have is to beat them at their
[3:04:25.040 --> 3:04:30.920]  own game to overpower them and we do have numbers and we do have truth on our side.
[3:04:30.920 --> 3:04:35.280]  They're truly on the dark side and they are on the dark side.
[3:04:35.280 --> 3:04:37.920]  Like Cheney said in that interview, he says we're working on the dark side.
[3:04:37.920 --> 3:04:38.920]  Stay there.
[3:04:38.920 --> 3:04:42.680]  I'm going to talk to you there in the break for the infowars.com stream listeners and
[3:04:42.680 --> 3:04:46.200]  then we'll come back for everybody else on the other side.
[3:04:46.200 --> 3:04:50.440]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[3:04:50.440 --> 3:04:54.880]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[3:04:54.880 --> 3:05:01.000]  It's known as the Builder Bird, but their objective being world domination.
[3:05:01.000 --> 3:05:04.160]  For thousands of years their dark order grew.
[3:05:04.160 --> 3:05:10.080]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
[3:05:10.080 --> 3:05:14.520]  of humanity is at hand.
[3:05:14.520 --> 3:05:19.960]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[3:05:19.960 --> 3:05:23.840]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[3:05:23.840 --> 3:05:26.520]  Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government.
[3:05:26.520 --> 3:05:27.520]  Most people have no idea.
[3:05:27.520 --> 3:05:28.520]  They're not after money.
[3:05:28.520 --> 3:05:29.520]  They have all the money they need.
[3:05:29.520 --> 3:05:30.520]  They're after power.
[3:05:30.520 --> 3:05:31.520]  That's their affidavit.

[3:05:48.480 --> 3:05:54.080]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfate, sodium, formaldehydes and more?
[3:05:54.080 --> 3:05:58.640]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which
[3:05:58.640 --> 3:05:59.640]  are synthetic.
[3:05:59.640 --> 3:06:01.080]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[3:06:01.080 --> 3:06:05.440]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing,
[3:06:05.440 --> 3:06:10.480]  wheezing and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin and mucous membranes.

[3:07:45.680 --> 3:07:51.600]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's
[3:07:51.600 --> 3:07:53.720]  a war on for your mind.
[3:07:53.720 --> 3:07:59.320]  G.Ever Griffin is our guest at the bottom of the hour, I promise we're going directly
[3:07:59.320 --> 3:08:00.320]  to your calls.
[3:08:00.320 --> 3:08:02.520]  It'll be with us at least 20 minutes into overdrive today.
[3:08:02.520 --> 3:08:09.480]  We'll be going to 320 at central standard time of the day.
[3:08:09.480 --> 3:08:13.880]  G.Ever Griffin we were talking about the ways the globalists distract us, divert us.
[3:08:13.880 --> 3:08:18.760]  They try to destroy our unity and I don't mean our unity is one organization.
[3:08:18.760 --> 3:08:23.040]  I don't want one group by the New World Order, I want lots of attack frigates out there going
[3:08:23.040 --> 3:08:24.040]  after them.
[3:08:24.040 --> 3:08:31.360]  But I mean unity of purpose or manifesto, what we believe in, the liberty, ideas like
[3:08:31.360 --> 3:08:32.360]  that.
[3:08:32.360 --> 3:08:35.440]  But then shifting gears back into, for the mainline people that are still tuned into
[3:08:35.440 --> 3:08:41.080]  the false paradigm, they keep saying Barack Obama is about making us believe in each other
[3:08:41.080 --> 3:08:43.640]  again, bringing us back together.
[3:08:43.640 --> 3:08:48.600]  What they mean is not bringing us back together, but bringing us back into being conned by
[3:08:48.600 --> 3:08:54.600]  the state, conned by the left-right paradigm, conned by the two parties one more time, taking
[3:08:54.600 --> 3:08:58.840]  us for one more ride while they finish getting their police state control grid in.
[3:08:58.840 --> 3:09:02.000]  And let me be clear, I'm not even entertaining a debate here.
[3:09:02.000 --> 3:09:04.600]  I'm not bashing Barack Obama here.
[3:09:04.600 --> 3:09:09.960]  The guy's a total puppet, runs nothing, you know, nice, handsome, friendly, smart guy,
[3:09:09.960 --> 3:09:11.160]  but he's a globalist.
[3:09:11.160 --> 3:09:15.200]  I dislike him less than Hillary because she's been around a while, you know, she's the
[3:09:15.200 --> 3:09:20.760]  devil I know, and I know she is a devil, but it doesn't matter.
[3:09:20.760 --> 3:09:26.040]  So me saying Barack Obama is a fake, is I'm not saying Hillary's good, I'm not saying
[3:09:26.040 --> 3:09:29.240]  McCain's good, they're all bad.
[3:09:29.240 --> 3:09:35.200]  And so occasionally they give you a new puppet to make you think that things have changed.
[3:09:35.200 --> 3:09:37.280]  I'm not trying to take hope away here.
[3:09:37.280 --> 3:09:43.240]  I want you to know there's hope in real resistance, in a real awakening, in local government,
[3:09:43.240 --> 3:09:48.360]  in you taking action, in you running for office, in you educating others, instead of wasting
[3:09:48.360 --> 3:09:53.680]  all our energies like all these young people are doing, sorry, I just, I just love Hillary,
[3:09:53.680 --> 3:09:56.600]  I love McCain, I love Obama.
[3:09:56.600 --> 3:10:01.760]  You know, you see all these, you know, intelligent, great looking college girls just out there
[3:10:01.760 --> 3:10:05.880]  dedicating themselves to Hillary or Barack Obama, or all these well-meaning business
[3:10:05.880 --> 3:10:10.200]  people for McCain when they're all America killers, they're all globalists.
[3:10:10.200 --> 3:10:13.480]  G. Edward Griffin.
[3:10:13.480 --> 3:10:14.480]  What can you say?
[3:10:14.480 --> 3:10:15.480]  That's true.
[3:10:15.480 --> 3:10:19.120]  And the reason they're that way is because their opinions have been engineered by the
[3:10:19.120 --> 3:10:24.240]  media and to a large extent by the educational system that some of the younger people are
[3:10:24.240 --> 3:10:25.440]  still in.
[3:10:25.440 --> 3:10:31.160]  When you look at the campaign rhetoric of these major candidates, they can talk for hours
[3:10:31.160 --> 3:10:35.800]  and not really say anything, but they are their masters at using words that sound good
[3:10:35.800 --> 3:10:39.120]  like, well, Obama's famous word, change.
[3:10:39.120 --> 3:10:44.080]  We want change, or big chance, yes, change, change, change, but if you asked any of them,
[3:10:44.080 --> 3:10:45.360]  well, what would you change?
[3:10:45.360 --> 3:10:48.000]  There would probably be dead silence because they don't know.
[3:10:48.000 --> 3:10:49.440]  They'd say, well, we'll change the name.
[3:10:49.440 --> 3:10:54.720]  We'll change the name from Bush to Obama or something, you know.
[3:10:54.720 --> 3:10:58.520]  But they have no idea of political principles.
[3:10:58.520 --> 3:11:04.040]  They have never even thought about the proper role of government or what the Constitution
[3:11:04.040 --> 3:11:09.760]  says about what these candidates are allowed or specifically not allowed to do.
[3:11:09.760 --> 3:11:15.000]  They haven't a single thought in their entire brains about political concepts, but yet they're
[3:11:15.000 --> 3:11:21.240]  out there carrying these banners and chanting, as you said, and they're all starry eyed over
[3:11:21.240 --> 3:11:31.760]  some kind of a word game, just change or compassion or patriotism or who knows what these words
[3:11:31.760 --> 3:11:35.200]  mean, the inner recesses of their minds.
[3:11:35.200 --> 3:11:39.400]  But they certainly don't mean anything in the realm of political principle, and until
[3:11:39.400 --> 3:11:44.680]  the American people start thinking about political principles once again, there is no hope.
[3:11:44.680 --> 3:11:49.160]  So you're quite right when you say, why should we even entertain a debate or try to choose
[3:11:49.160 --> 3:11:55.400]  upsides between all three of these word masters, and it's not just them, it's the organizations
[3:11:55.400 --> 3:12:00.280]  that support them, when the real issues are never allowed to be even discussed in such
[3:12:00.280 --> 3:12:01.880]  a debate.
[3:12:01.880 --> 3:12:09.280]  And so, yes, our job has to be not to get entrapped by this so-called two-party system
[3:12:09.280 --> 3:12:11.800]  when in reality it's not a two-party system.
[3:12:11.800 --> 3:12:14.120]  Well, it's a carnival distraction.
[3:12:14.120 --> 3:12:20.160]  It's like having a traveling carnival, a troop of trained monkeys dance in front of you while
[3:12:20.160 --> 3:12:24.360]  somebody sneaks up on you to stab you in the back.
[3:12:24.360 --> 3:12:25.360]  It's distraction.
[3:12:25.360 --> 3:12:31.080]  It's the same thing that the magician does, where he has his beautiful assistant bend over
[3:12:31.080 --> 3:12:37.840]  in front of the crowd while he stages the hat trick.
[3:12:37.840 --> 3:12:39.840]  It works every time, doesn't it?
[3:12:39.840 --> 3:12:40.840]  Yeah.
[3:12:40.840 --> 3:12:45.840]  Well, that was the theme of my presentation when I was there in Austin a few weeks ago,
[3:12:45.840 --> 3:12:46.840]  as you remember.
[3:12:46.840 --> 3:12:52.400]  We called it the Quigley formula, and it was named after Professor Carol Quigley, who wrote
[3:12:52.400 --> 3:12:58.640]  the book, Tragedy and Hope, who was sort of an unofficial or maybe an official historian
[3:12:58.640 --> 3:13:03.080]  for a secret society founded by Cecil Rhodes, and we go into all of that history.
[3:13:03.080 --> 3:13:08.120]  And the reason that history is interesting and the reason it's important is because without
[3:13:08.120 --> 3:13:14.320]  an understanding of how the two-party systems came into being, if you don't know the history,
[3:13:14.320 --> 3:13:18.720]  if you don't know the fact that there is an organization that has a strategy for doing
[3:13:18.720 --> 3:13:24.320]  exactly what we're complaining about here, people would say, well, I guess it just happened.
[3:13:24.320 --> 3:13:26.240]  Well, no, it didn't just happen.
[3:13:26.240 --> 3:13:29.600]  This came about as a result of a very well-thought-out plan.
[3:13:29.600 --> 3:13:34.360]  It's being implemented today by people who have names, who belong to an organization
[3:13:34.360 --> 3:13:37.680]  that has a name, has a headquarters in New York and all of that.
[3:13:37.680 --> 3:13:43.680]  And so once you tell people about the facts behind what's happening and the names and
[3:13:43.680 --> 3:13:47.400]  the places and the dates, then all of a sudden it becomes real.
[3:13:47.400 --> 3:13:51.080]  Other than that, before they have all that information, they would just look at you and
[3:13:51.080 --> 3:13:52.960]  say, what are you talking about?
[3:13:52.960 --> 3:13:55.760]  I don't think that's true.
[3:13:55.760 --> 3:14:04.000]  And so what we're facing now is the fact that the people of America are starving for information
[3:14:04.000 --> 3:14:05.360]  and factual data.
[3:14:05.360 --> 3:14:09.760]  And I think that's a rule.
[3:14:09.760 --> 3:14:10.760]  I agree with you.
[3:14:10.760 --> 3:14:17.000]  They are starving, and so they give them real simple pap, like change, change, knowing that
[3:14:17.000 --> 3:14:22.160]  stacked up against the two establishment candidates that another establishment candidate can be
[3:14:22.160 --> 3:14:27.080]  slipped in on them, talk a little bit about the Quigley formula, because there are hundreds
[3:14:27.080 --> 3:14:33.640]  of published PhD-level elite text used by globalist managers.
[3:14:33.640 --> 3:14:38.680]  And I know I've read scores of them, and they talk about how we're dumb animals, and they
[3:14:38.680 --> 3:14:42.160]  talk about how we'll never read how they're calling us dumb animals.
[3:14:42.160 --> 3:14:46.200]  And I mean, is it frustrating to you, because that's one of the things that drives me crazy,
[3:14:46.200 --> 3:14:50.120]  that some good old boy at the gym will waddle over and make fun of me saying, I believe in
[3:14:50.120 --> 3:14:58.320]  imaginary groups, when the heads of political science divisions of top universities write
[3:14:58.320 --> 3:15:03.880]  books about how they engineer the shadow government system and how we run nothing.
[3:15:03.880 --> 3:15:08.160]  I mean, it's very frustrating to know that we've spent the time to read all these books
[3:15:08.160 --> 3:15:13.320]  and watch these people on C-SPAN, and then the public, I mean, I hate the globalists,
[3:15:13.320 --> 3:15:19.480]  but at the same time, the public has been engineered to like laugh at us for trying
[3:15:19.480 --> 3:15:20.480]  to save them.
[3:15:20.480 --> 3:15:21.480]  I mean, it's disgusting.
[3:15:21.480 --> 3:15:28.120]  Well, yeah, and you have to not blame the public to a certain extent, because they're
[3:15:28.120 --> 3:15:34.600]  just the products of programming, very effective programming, although I still think that if
[3:15:34.600 --> 3:15:40.120]  anybody had any kind of an instinct for truth, they would somehow break through that.
[3:15:40.120 --> 3:15:45.000]  I guess we did somehow, I don't know whether that was to our benefit or simply because
[3:15:45.000 --> 3:15:49.520]  of an accident that happened along the way, but in any event, yeah, it is frustrating,
[3:15:49.520 --> 3:15:56.560]  but the bottom line is that this is not imaginary, and anybody who has any intellectual curiosity
[3:15:56.560 --> 3:16:00.480]  or honesty about them would say, okay, where are your facts?
[3:16:00.480 --> 3:16:03.120]  And then that's where we come in, here are the facts.
[3:16:03.120 --> 3:16:08.160]  And I found that generally, if you have the ability to present the facts without being
[3:16:08.160 --> 3:16:13.440]  interrupted, you know, give me 20 or 30 minutes, and if people are interested enough to sit
[3:16:13.440 --> 3:16:18.840]  and listen to a presentation for 20 or 30 minutes, I'll convince them, not that I convince
[3:16:18.840 --> 3:16:22.680]  them, but the facts will convince them because they're irrefutable.
[3:16:22.680 --> 3:16:28.240]  So that's our job is to find those people, and there won't be many, probably three percent
[3:16:28.240 --> 3:16:34.000]  or less, who have the intellectual curiosity and the intellectual honesty to ask the question,
[3:16:34.000 --> 3:16:35.480]  where are your facts?
[3:16:35.480 --> 3:16:40.520]  And that's all we need, Alex, and you know that, we don't need that 51, that magic 51
[3:16:40.520 --> 3:16:44.520]  percent of the population, the majority never determined anything.
[3:16:44.520 --> 3:16:50.520]  They're always led by the few, three percent or less, who can generate a majority by the
[3:16:50.520 --> 3:16:52.400]  strength of their leadership.
[3:16:52.400 --> 3:16:56.320]  And that's what we must do, that's what our enemies have done, and as you know, that's
[3:16:56.320 --> 3:17:02.480]  what Freedom Force is all about, is to move into the power centers of society, those groups
[3:17:02.480 --> 3:17:08.680]  and organizations that people belong to, that lead the political thinking of the nation.
[3:17:08.680 --> 3:17:13.320]  We have to become influential in those groups now, just the way our opponents have in the
[3:17:13.320 --> 3:17:14.320]  past.
[3:17:14.320 --> 3:17:17.920]  Well, now again, I'm trying to be subtle here, not that I'm delicate or not that I'm
[3:17:17.920 --> 3:17:21.080]  even well-spoken, maybe I haven't explained it right to some people.
[3:17:21.080 --> 3:17:25.240]  I'm not against the militia, I believe in the militia, I'm a member of the militia, 18
[3:17:25.240 --> 3:17:30.640]  to 44, we're all part of it, and it's in our constitution, and the feds say we have
[3:17:30.640 --> 3:17:37.760]  no right to own guns, it's only an organized militia, but that didn't exist until 1907.
[3:17:37.760 --> 3:17:42.120]  So we know it's our right to keep our arms, it's defending its criminals and the government,
[3:17:42.120 --> 3:17:46.400]  and I've read the Federalist Papers and others on air, but then you've got what the modern
[3:17:46.400 --> 3:17:53.380]  militia movement is, and that's feds setting up innocent good people, and usually the militia
[3:17:53.380 --> 3:17:58.080]  leaders are feds, and it's a thing of paranoia, don't trust your neighbors, meet us behind
[3:17:58.080 --> 3:18:02.440]  the barn, and then the fed says let's build a bomb so they can send a bunch of innocent
[3:18:02.440 --> 3:18:07.280]  farmers to jail, and then asset forfeiture of their farms, and then I get on air and
[3:18:07.280 --> 3:18:12.120]  I say watch out, we're up front, we're in suits and ties, we're well-spoken, we're the
[3:18:12.120 --> 3:18:16.560]  good guys, but the feds, when they run these operations, they've tried to always steer
[3:18:16.560 --> 3:18:22.040]  our movement into hiding, and like it's secret agent stuff, and it's all, oh my God, everyone's
[3:18:22.040 --> 3:18:25.000]  watching you and wanting to get you, and I'm saying no, no, no, no, this isn't a thing
[3:18:25.000 --> 3:18:30.760]  of paranoia, we are the good guys, we're out in the town square with a wide hat at
[3:18:30.760 --> 3:18:34.240]  high noon saying bring it on, do you see the point I'm making?
[3:18:34.240 --> 3:18:41.120]  Oh absolutely, I couldn't agree with you more, and yeah, it has always worried me deeply
[3:18:41.120 --> 3:18:48.120]  as to the character that the militia movements have taken, they're going in the wrong direction,
[3:18:48.120 --> 3:18:53.960]  and I think the reason, as you've just stated, is because they are under the influence of
[3:18:53.960 --> 3:18:58.000]  my job provocateurs who are sitting there to do that, just to mess it up so it won't
[3:18:58.000 --> 3:18:59.000]  possibly work.
[3:18:59.000 --> 3:19:03.960]  Oh, we've caught them hundreds of times in every case, it turns out that's what they
[3:19:03.960 --> 3:19:04.960]  do.
[3:19:04.960 --> 3:19:09.960]  So, they're smart, though, okay, they're smart, now what are we going to do about it?
[3:19:09.960 --> 3:19:16.720]  Let's be just as smart, let's not let them win that game, let's be aware of it and move
[3:19:16.720 --> 3:19:17.720]  around.
[3:19:17.720 --> 3:19:22.320]  Well, I remember when I was just a mainline conservative, but fighting for property rights
[3:19:22.320 --> 3:19:26.000]  locally, I'd have a guy show up at an event and say I want to work with you, let's kill
[3:19:26.000 --> 3:19:32.000]  cops, and I'd follow him outside and get in an unmarked cop car, and you know, I mean
[3:19:32.000 --> 3:19:39.000]  it's just, these people are criminals, dirtbag slime, and, well, Texas Monthly caught the
[3:19:39.000 --> 3:19:42.080]  FBI creating a clan group trying to give them to blow up a chemical plant, they were
[3:19:42.080 --> 3:19:46.400]  so dumb the FBI couldn't get them to do it.
[3:19:46.400 --> 3:19:54.400]  It is a big idea, a new world order, in the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful
[3:19:54.400 --> 3:19:55.400]  world government.
[3:19:55.400 --> 3:20:01.200]  It's known as the Builder Bird, but their objective being world domination.
[3:20:01.200 --> 3:20:04.360]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[3:20:04.360 --> 3:20:09.360]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating
[3:20:09.360 --> 3:20:17.840]  80% of humanity is at hand, for the first time in history, the elite's plan for world
[3:20:17.840 --> 3:20:22.800]  government is blown wide open, you will learn the secret that drives the entire new world
[3:20:22.800 --> 3:20:23.800]  order agenda.
[3:20:23.800 --> 3:20:26.720]  Builder Bird is making great progress for the world government.
[3:20:26.720 --> 3:20:29.800]  Most people have no idea, they're not after money, they have all the money they need,
[3:20:29.800 --> 3:20:32.040]  they're after power, that's their aptitude.

[3:23:52.680 --> 3:24:01.680]  No matter how hard you try you can't stop us now.
[3:24:01.680 --> 3:24:05.680]  We're the renegades and it's atomic age.
[3:24:05.680 --> 3:24:09.680]  It's atomic age of renegades.
[3:24:09.680 --> 3:24:13.680]  Renegades and it's atomic age.
[3:24:13.680 --> 3:24:15.680]  It's atomic age of renegades.
[3:24:15.680 --> 3:24:16.680]  It's atomic age of renegades.
[3:24:16.680 --> 3:24:22.680]  Since the previous storm engages and the days of ancient Greece walk down through the Middle Ages.
[3:24:22.680 --> 3:24:27.680]  Plenty of us kept going through ages and ended up with a size K.
[3:24:27.680 --> 3:24:29.680]  That times continued to change.
[3:24:29.680 --> 3:24:34.680]  Nothing stayed the same but there were always renegades like you've said before.
[3:24:34.680 --> 3:24:35.680]  Tom paid.
[3:24:35.680 --> 3:24:39.680]  And I'll tell you why it's because the globalists claim that their breeding makes them got him
[3:24:39.680 --> 3:24:46.360]  really a bunch of inbred, mentally retarded individuals at the top with these criminal
[3:24:46.360 --> 3:24:48.600]  bureaucracies that serve them.
[3:24:48.600 --> 3:24:51.080]  That's where their genius still lies.
[3:24:51.080 --> 3:24:54.880]  The truth is, from the common people also comes intelligence, and we don't want to be
[3:24:54.880 --> 3:24:56.720]  your slaves.
[3:24:56.720 --> 3:24:59.240]  We're not lesser men, and we're not going to go along with you.
[3:24:59.240 --> 3:25:04.040]  Gee, Edward Griffin, we'll talk through the next segment into the next break for mfowars.com,
[3:25:04.040 --> 3:25:05.160]  Internet Stream listeners.
[3:25:05.160 --> 3:25:09.520]  But right now, you want to get into Carol Quigley and the Quigley Method, because I didn't
[3:25:09.520 --> 3:25:13.880]  want to kind of give away your thunder when you were on before you gave your UT speech,
[3:25:13.880 --> 3:25:17.640]  but maybe now you should spend some time on that, and then we'll start taking phone calls
[3:25:17.640 --> 3:25:18.640]  in about 10 minutes.
[3:25:18.640 --> 3:25:24.120]  Yeah, I'd like to do that, Alex, but may I finish where my brain was going with our
[3:25:24.120 --> 3:25:25.120]  last segment?
[3:25:25.120 --> 3:25:26.120]  Certainly.
[3:25:26.120 --> 3:25:31.840]  We were talking about false leadership, and how effective that can be, especially if the
[3:25:31.840 --> 3:25:37.480]  victim is not even aware of the possibility that this tactic is being used.
[3:25:37.480 --> 3:25:41.800]  For once in a while, after I've written something or said something about this, I'll get an
[3:25:41.800 --> 3:25:47.280]  email from some person that said, how do we know that you are not a false leader?
[3:25:47.280 --> 3:25:49.480]  And of course, that's a darn good question.
[3:25:49.480 --> 3:25:53.920]  I'm very happy to hear that, because now I know that people are beginning to look around
[3:25:53.920 --> 3:25:57.360]  at the question, and that the answer to that is very simple.
[3:25:57.360 --> 3:26:01.880]  You can tell whether a person is a false leader, and not simply by looking at their
[3:26:01.880 --> 3:26:05.080]  record, where they've been, how long they've been doing it, and what they've actually
[3:26:05.080 --> 3:26:06.080]  done.
[3:26:06.080 --> 3:26:07.080]  They're fruits.
[3:26:07.080 --> 3:26:09.480]  The fruits shall reveal them.
[3:26:09.480 --> 3:26:14.520]  So you see, if they have a record of dividing people, whether they have a record of diverting
[3:26:14.520 --> 3:26:20.480]  attention away from the real culprit, which is the government, not government, but people
[3:26:20.480 --> 3:26:23.080]  in government, I always want to emphasize that.
[3:26:23.080 --> 3:26:24.840]  We're not opposed to government.
[3:26:24.840 --> 3:26:27.640]  We're opposed to corruption in government.
[3:26:27.640 --> 3:26:31.840]  And if you can see that leaders have been focused on the corruption in government, and
[3:26:31.840 --> 3:26:36.640]  consistently have tried to unite people, they're probably on the right track.
[3:26:36.640 --> 3:26:42.760]  Because if they've always left behind them a debris of broken organizations and anger
[3:26:42.760 --> 3:26:49.280]  and division, you've got a pretty good idea that you're dealing with a false leader.
[3:26:49.280 --> 3:26:55.280]  And so what we're trying to do is build a dependable leadership core that people can
[3:26:55.280 --> 3:26:58.480]  rely on, especially people coming into the movement early.
[3:26:58.480 --> 3:27:03.360]  I mean, just recently, I should say, people who haven't had a chance to spend years and
[3:27:03.360 --> 3:27:04.720]  years studying this thing.
[3:27:04.720 --> 3:27:08.240]  They need someone they can rely on, someone with that record.
[3:27:08.240 --> 3:27:13.240]  And we're hoping that people will consider Freedom Force International to be that.
[3:27:13.240 --> 3:27:19.720]  So if you're trying to figure out who you can rely on, come to Freedom Force International.
[3:27:19.720 --> 3:27:21.880]  Check us out and ask that question.
[3:27:21.880 --> 3:27:26.760]  Well, I'll say, G. Edward Griffin, the enemy doesn't operate for five years, 10 years,
[3:27:26.760 --> 3:27:33.520]  20 years, 30 years, 40 plus years since 1959, as you have been doing.
[3:27:33.520 --> 3:27:36.080]  That's almost 50 years.
[3:27:36.080 --> 3:27:39.320]  They reveal themselves quickly, especially in our own movement.
[3:27:39.320 --> 3:27:40.320]  They usually work about a year.
[3:27:40.320 --> 3:27:43.560]  In fact, it's usually exactly 12 months is phase one.
[3:27:43.560 --> 3:27:49.160]  They try to build an audience on radio, internet, TV, and then suddenly they attack everyone
[3:27:49.160 --> 3:27:50.600]  and say, you can't trust anyone.
[3:27:50.600 --> 3:27:52.320]  It's nothing but division.
[3:27:52.320 --> 3:27:57.440]  I will tell people that most of the groups and organizations out there are actually
[3:27:57.440 --> 3:28:08.240]  good, the folks out on the ground are good, but you can really tell the organizations
[3:28:08.240 --> 3:28:09.240]  of people that are bad.
[3:28:09.240 --> 3:28:11.240]  And I mean, do you have a Griffin?
[3:28:11.240 --> 3:28:13.280]  We know you're good.
[3:28:13.280 --> 3:28:16.120]  We know so many others are good as well.
[3:28:16.120 --> 3:28:21.160]  And a lot of it's also discernment, you know, having your head in the game a long time.
[3:28:21.160 --> 3:28:28.240]  But also, not just being aware of this info, being aware of also the fact that we can also
[3:28:28.240 --> 3:28:32.960]  get to into this where we're too focused in paranoia and then never just move forward.
[3:28:32.960 --> 3:28:37.520]  I think really having a good attitude, viewers out there, listeners out there, you know
[3:28:37.520 --> 3:28:38.600]  that you're good people.
[3:28:38.600 --> 3:28:40.000]  You know your leaders.
[3:28:40.000 --> 3:28:42.440]  You know that you've done nothing wrong.
[3:28:42.440 --> 3:28:44.440]  You know that you're doing this for the right reason.
[3:28:44.440 --> 3:28:46.040]  So you be leaders.
[3:28:46.040 --> 3:28:47.680]  You go out and start organizations.
[3:28:47.680 --> 3:28:51.440]  I mean, I think, you know, there's no excuse there, is there, G.E. Evergryphon?
[3:28:51.440 --> 3:28:53.920]  No, no excuse at all whatsoever.
[3:28:53.920 --> 3:28:58.920]  And you know, in a way that takes us back finally to the Quigley formula, because Quigley
[3:28:58.920 --> 3:29:05.680]  was talking to some, to a very important extent about how to provide false leadership.
[3:29:05.680 --> 3:29:08.240]  And so, are we ready for that topic?
[3:29:08.240 --> 3:29:09.240]  Yes.
[3:29:09.240 --> 3:29:14.240]  Let's continue discussing that during the segment of your listening to the infowars.com
[3:29:14.240 --> 3:29:18.040]  audio streams, this discussion will continue in 10 seconds at infowars.com.
[3:29:18.040 --> 3:29:22.480]  If not, we'll be back in three minutes to continue fleshing out the Quigley formula.
[3:29:22.480 --> 3:29:24.960]  And then your phone calls with G.E. Evergryphon.
[3:29:24.960 --> 3:29:28.720]  We got him on a bit late today, so we'll be going into overdrive today, 20 minutes after
[3:29:28.720 --> 3:29:33.440]  the main transmission ends with G.E. Evergryphon, so we have an hour left or about 50 minutes
[3:29:33.440 --> 3:29:34.440]  before us.
[3:29:34.440 --> 3:29:36.160]  Stay with us.
[3:29:36.160 --> 3:29:39.880]  We're on the march, the empires on the run.
[3:29:39.880 --> 3:29:46.400]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:29:46.400 --> 3:29:50.240]  Hi, this is Alex Jones, and I want to talk to you about the high price of gasoline.
[3:29:50.240 --> 3:29:54.200]  It's no secret that gasoline quality is poor, even though we're paying record prices at
[3:29:54.200 --> 3:29:55.200]  the pump.
[3:29:55.200 --> 3:29:59.240]  I have run across a company called SFR, who has developed two products that improve gas
[3:29:59.240 --> 3:30:00.240]  mileage.
[3:30:00.240 --> 3:30:04.600]  Instead of paying a mechanic as much as $300 to clean your injection system, protect a
[3:30:04.600 --> 3:30:10.240]  complete fuel system treatment, cleans to 95% of new engine condition, improving mileage
[3:30:10.240 --> 3:30:11.800]  and only one tank full.
[3:30:11.800 --> 3:30:15.560]  Protect an engine treatment not only reduces friction, but it extends the life of your
[3:30:15.560 --> 3:30:16.560]  engine.
[3:30:16.560 --> 3:30:20.280]  Let's face it, with the high price of gasoline, it's time to take action.
[3:30:20.280 --> 3:30:25.520]  Purchase a protective fuel system treatment for only $9.95 and receive a free engine treatment,
[3:30:25.520 --> 3:30:28.120]  which is a $12.95 value free.
[3:30:28.120 --> 3:30:30.360]  Call triple eight, use SFR 1.
[3:30:30.360 --> 3:30:37.600]  That number again is triple eight, use SFR 1 or check them out online at OilCompanySecret.com.
[3:30:37.600 --> 3:30:40.240]  That's OilCompanySecret.com.
[3:30:40.240 --> 3:30:44.080]  Satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back, and it's safe for all cars.
[3:30:44.080 --> 3:30:45.080]  Act now.
[3:30:45.080 --> 3:30:48.600]  Hi, this is Dave from Ready Reserve Foods.
[3:30:48.600 --> 3:30:52.000]  I have been waiting patiently for the government and mainstream media to inform you of what
[3:30:52.000 --> 3:30:56.080]  is turning out to be the biggest problem facing the world in the last 50 years.
[3:30:56.080 --> 3:30:59.920]  For the last three years, the earth has consumed more food than it has been able to produce,
[3:30:59.920 --> 3:31:01.680]  and it has now finally caught up with us.
[3:31:01.680 --> 3:31:05.320]  In the U.S., commodities such as flour and rice are already being rationed, and the next
[3:31:05.320 --> 3:31:08.640]  rice crop won't be available for another four to five months.
[3:31:08.640 --> 3:31:11.840]  It's fall in the Southern Hemisphere, and many countries are short the food necessary
[3:31:11.840 --> 3:31:16.240]  to make it through the winter and have stopped exporting certain commodities altogether.
[3:31:16.240 --> 3:31:17.880]  Remember our trade deficit?
[3:31:17.880 --> 3:31:21.080]  Trillions of dollars have stacked up outside the country and are now rushing in to buy
[3:31:21.080 --> 3:31:23.440]  our food production at any price.
[3:31:23.440 --> 3:31:27.560]  By late summer, if not early fall, it is likely our government will step in and control food
[3:31:27.560 --> 3:31:29.960]  and food exports under martial law.
[3:31:29.960 --> 3:31:42.880]  Call Ready Reserve Foods at 1-800-453-2202, 1-800-453-2202, or visit us at www.readyreservefoods.com,
[3:31:42.880 --> 3:31:49.480]  1-800-453-2202.
[3:31:49.480 --> 3:31:52.080]  We're already under a scientific dictatorship.
[3:31:52.080 --> 3:31:55.360]  Martial law is coming, but it's not going to arrive overnight.
[3:31:55.360 --> 3:31:59.280]  It's going to be incremental. This country is already teetering on the edge.
[3:31:59.280 --> 3:32:02.560]  Any incident, small or large, could trigger a total takeover.
[3:32:02.560 --> 3:32:03.920]  Anything could be the final push.

[3:32:07.360 --> 3:32:09.680]  you for life under total military control.
[3:32:09.680 --> 3:32:13.080]  Know how to survive in the conditions that may soon be here on American soil.
[3:32:13.080 --> 3:32:16.200]  Learn how to act around controlling troops and how to use their own psychology against
[3:32:16.200 --> 3:32:17.960]  them through social engineering.
[3:32:17.960 --> 3:32:21.360]  When martial law is officially announced, checkpoints will be enforced, gun confiscations
[3:32:21.360 --> 3:32:24.560]  will occur for registered gun owners, and cities will be on lockdown.
[3:32:24.560 --> 3:32:27.560]  You will be dealing with a force that has been in training for years preparing for this
[3:32:27.560 --> 3:32:28.560]  takeover.

[3:32:38.720 --> 3:32:41.440]  That's 866-644-1933.
[3:32:41.440 --> 3:32:56.640]  We'll be going into overdrive, that is, the main radio show is four hours Monday through
[3:32:56.640 --> 3:33:00.720]  Friday, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. and I come back Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[3:33:00.720 --> 3:33:04.480]  This new older takeover is very serious and I take it very serious.
[3:33:04.480 --> 3:33:07.360]  That's why I work normally about 14 hours a day.
[3:33:07.360 --> 3:33:09.680]  I've cut back from 18 hours a day.
[3:33:09.680 --> 3:33:13.880]  That's why I've made a new film that I'll be showing at the Alamo Draft House this Saturday
[3:33:13.880 --> 3:33:21.000]  at 3.30, downtown Alamo at their new quote, Ritz location, details at infowars.com.
[3:33:21.000 --> 3:33:25.800]  For infowars.com listeners on our internet streams and for those watching PrisonPlanet.tv,
[3:33:25.800 --> 3:33:30.800]  we continue during the break talking about Carol Quigley, who set up the Rhodes Scholarship
[3:33:30.800 --> 3:33:31.800]  Program.
[3:33:31.800 --> 3:33:37.640]  He owned the major diamond mines and gold mines in Rhodesia, in South Africa, north of there,
[3:33:37.640 --> 3:33:41.240]  and of course, it turned out he was just an agent of the Queen the entire time.
[3:33:41.240 --> 3:33:46.520]  And of course, one of his people that worked for him wrote a book about it after he died.
[3:33:46.520 --> 3:33:50.760]  Do you think everybody that is a Rhodes Scholar ends up staying on their payroll?
[3:33:50.760 --> 3:33:54.440]  Because we see a Krzysztoferson who speaks out against him.
[3:33:54.440 --> 3:34:00.320]  We see a Naomi Wolf who comes out and speaks out against it, you know, the Marshall Law
[3:34:00.320 --> 3:34:01.320]  set up.
[3:34:01.320 --> 3:34:04.040]  But I had her on the show a few months ago and I said, but you're a Rhodes Scholar.
[3:34:04.040 --> 3:34:08.000]  I said, people ask how we get these guests that we call their publicists.
[3:34:08.000 --> 3:34:09.000]  We get them on.
[3:34:09.000 --> 3:34:10.000]  You can try it too if you'd like.
[3:34:10.000 --> 3:34:12.000]  I think it's a conspiracy that we're able to get them on.
[3:34:12.000 --> 3:34:13.480]  It's a big radio show, folks.
[3:34:13.480 --> 3:34:17.080]  They want to come on and pick their book and you can call them too and get them on your
[3:34:17.080 --> 3:34:18.080]  show probably.
[3:34:18.080 --> 3:34:21.120]  If you know how to talk to someone on the telephone, that is, that's the big conspiracy
[3:34:21.120 --> 3:34:22.120]  is just to act friendly.
[3:34:22.120 --> 3:34:24.360]  I'm just being sarcastic of some people out there.
[3:34:24.360 --> 3:34:26.080]  But the point is I had her on and asked the hard question.
[3:34:26.080 --> 3:34:27.800]  I said, are you for a world government?
[3:34:27.800 --> 3:34:31.880]  She said, no, they didn't teach me that in a Rhodes Scholarship, but I know that Cecil
[3:34:31.880 --> 3:34:37.480]  Rhodes called for a world government, called for a British Anglo file dominated system,
[3:34:37.480 --> 3:34:38.480]  merged with Rothschilds.
[3:34:38.480 --> 3:34:41.400]  So do you think Naomi Wolfe is fibbing there?
[3:34:41.400 --> 3:34:45.600]  No, that's a really good question and you're not the first person that asked that question
[3:34:45.600 --> 3:34:46.600]  of me.
[3:34:46.600 --> 3:34:51.920]  I find it hard to believe that a person can be selected as a Rhodes Scholarship and
[3:34:51.920 --> 3:34:57.480]  actually go through the whole process and be educated there in London and be part of
[3:34:57.480 --> 3:35:01.360]  that group without being a devotee of world government.
[3:35:01.360 --> 3:35:04.160]  I just find that very, very difficult to believe.
[3:35:04.160 --> 3:35:08.120]  You know, Chris Christaverson's people said they knew who we were, but they wasn't going
[3:35:08.120 --> 3:35:09.120]  to come on the show.
[3:35:09.120 --> 3:35:14.600]  But then we get Willie Nelson and Jesse Ventura and Tommy Chong and Charlie Sheen and German
[3:35:14.600 --> 3:35:16.320]  defense ministers.
[3:35:16.320 --> 3:35:21.240]  The incredible thing is I had this, the head of the Kissinger group on last week and when
[3:35:21.240 --> 3:35:23.000]  I got him on during the break, I said, hello, sir.
[3:35:23.000 --> 3:35:24.600]  He started laughing at me and I said, what's funny?
[3:35:24.600 --> 3:35:26.320]  He goes, oh, Alex Jones.
[3:35:26.320 --> 3:35:27.440]  And I said, oh, you know who I am.
[3:35:27.440 --> 3:35:28.440]  You're coming on.
[3:35:28.440 --> 3:35:29.600]  It goes, of course, we all know who you are.
[3:35:29.600 --> 3:35:31.960]  In fact, John Harmon, running the show, heard it.
[3:35:31.960 --> 3:35:39.880]  Hey, John, were you listening in on that conversation I had with the head of the Kissinger group?
[3:35:39.880 --> 3:35:40.880]  Are you on air right now?
[3:35:40.880 --> 3:35:42.600]  No, I am.
[3:35:42.600 --> 3:35:43.600]  Bring yourself on air.
[3:35:43.600 --> 3:35:44.600]  Did you hear how he admitted?
[3:35:44.600 --> 3:35:47.560]  I mean, I didn't want to toot my horn on air, would have sounded obnoxious.
[3:35:47.560 --> 3:35:51.480]  But after the fact that isn't that he knew who I was, that's actually scary.
[3:35:51.480 --> 3:35:54.720]  This is the head of the Kissinger group, one of the heads of the Carnegie Endowment.
[3:35:54.720 --> 3:35:56.880]  And he's saying, yeah, we all know who you are.
[3:35:56.880 --> 3:36:00.120]  Well, John, you heard it, tell, uh, tell Jebra Griffin what he was saying.
[3:36:00.120 --> 3:36:04.080]  Oh, yeah, it was very arrogant and, uh, you know, Jones was joking with him, calling
[3:36:04.080 --> 3:36:07.760]  a master and he seemed to like that, actually.
[3:36:07.760 --> 3:36:11.160]  So, uh, yeah, yeah, I'm sure he does like that.
[3:36:11.160 --> 3:36:15.640]  These guys are, you know, very arrogant and, uh, you know, they want people just, uh, do
[3:36:15.640 --> 3:36:16.640]  what they say.
[3:36:16.640 --> 3:36:17.640]  Yeah.
[3:36:17.640 --> 3:36:23.200]  See what happened is we got him queued up, um, and I, you know, John called him at like
[3:36:23.200 --> 3:36:25.880]  29 after and then he was going to be on at 33 after.
[3:36:25.880 --> 3:36:27.600]  So I come on and say, thank you for coming on.
[3:36:27.600 --> 3:36:31.280]  We're not live yet, uh, but I'm going to have you on in just a moment, sir.
[3:36:31.280 --> 3:36:36.880]  He started laughing at me and I said, uh, was something wrong and he said, no, Alex Jones.
[3:36:36.880 --> 3:36:38.160]  And I went, what, do you know who I am?
[3:36:38.160 --> 3:36:40.400]  And he goes, of course we know who you are.
[3:36:40.400 --> 3:36:43.080]  I mean, folks, do you realize they know who I am?
[3:36:43.080 --> 3:36:47.280]  Jebra Griffin, that means we must be hurting him if he was, if he wanted to arrogantly
[3:36:47.280 --> 3:36:49.480]  laugh at me before we went on air.
[3:36:49.480 --> 3:36:54.760]  I mean, I remember six years ago in the, in LA, having Lionel Shetwin, who made the film
[3:36:54.760 --> 3:36:59.320]  about Bush being a hero in 9-11, the head of his film commission came up in the bathroom
[3:36:59.320 --> 3:37:03.440]  while I was at the urinal and threatened me and said, we're going to get you.
[3:37:03.440 --> 3:37:06.760]  And then I went out on TV and debated him, but I mean, I'm not tooting my horn.
[3:37:06.760 --> 3:37:07.760]  That's actually scary.
[3:37:07.760 --> 3:37:09.600]  But that shows how real this is.
[3:37:09.600 --> 3:37:10.600]  Doesn't it, G-Edward?
[3:37:10.600 --> 3:37:11.600]  Oh yeah.
[3:37:11.600 --> 3:37:16.280]  This is, this is real stuff, uh, and, uh, usually it doesn't happen in the bathroom.
[3:37:16.280 --> 3:37:20.280]  It usually happens in the boardroom, but it's very real stuff, Alex.
[3:37:20.280 --> 3:37:22.360]  And yeah, you bet they know who you are.
[3:37:22.360 --> 3:37:25.320]  Um, you're a thorn in their sights.
[3:37:25.320 --> 3:37:26.320]  And uh-
[3:37:26.320 --> 3:37:27.320]  People ask why they haven't killed me.
[3:37:27.320 --> 3:37:29.560]  Why did they haven't killed Jebra Griffin, haven't killed Alex Jones?
[3:37:29.560 --> 3:37:33.360]  I know you're sick of being asked that, but people are obsessed with it, so please humor
[3:37:33.360 --> 3:37:34.360]  them.
[3:37:34.360 --> 3:37:35.920]  Well, I know how they work.
[3:37:35.920 --> 3:37:42.040]  Um, they want us both eliminated and they have a different, a definite hierarchy of,
[3:37:42.040 --> 3:37:43.920]  of strategies for that.
[3:37:43.920 --> 3:37:46.600]  Uh, I've, I've observed it over the years.
[3:37:46.600 --> 3:37:50.920]  The first thing they do, if they want to eliminate their opposition is to ignore it.
[3:37:50.920 --> 3:37:54.880]  And you know, in 99% of the cases, that works just fine.
[3:37:54.880 --> 3:38:00.200]  You don't have to do anything because their opponents have no funding, they have no voice,
[3:38:00.200 --> 3:38:05.320]  they have no following, they have no way to survive, really.
[3:38:05.320 --> 3:38:09.480]  And so usually they're just a little splash in the pan and then they go away entirely
[3:38:09.480 --> 3:38:10.720]  on their own.
[3:38:10.720 --> 3:38:12.720]  So the first step is to ignore it.
[3:38:12.720 --> 3:38:17.240]  If that doesn't work, well, the next step is to discredit it, to destroy it in the eyes
[3:38:17.240 --> 3:38:18.720]  of the American public.
[3:38:18.720 --> 3:38:22.240]  And this is where they bring their big media guns into play.
[3:38:22.240 --> 3:38:28.080]  They, uh, they try and paint that big brush, uh, around the face of their target that
[3:38:28.080 --> 3:38:34.280]  makes them look like a, uh, some kind of a real nut, a child molester, a tax evader,
[3:38:34.280 --> 3:38:40.000]  a terrorist, or, oh God, I don't even know what they can throw at the American public.
[3:38:40.000 --> 3:38:41.000]  A hater.
[3:38:41.000 --> 3:38:42.000]  People believe it.
[3:38:42.000 --> 3:38:48.040]  A hater or something like that, a fascist, Nazi, a communist, they got all kinds of words,
[3:38:48.040 --> 3:38:53.780]  they're racist, uh, they've got a bushel basket full of words they can throw out, and unfortunately
[3:38:53.780 --> 3:38:56.640]  most of the American people will believe it.
[3:38:56.640 --> 3:38:58.040]  So that usually works.
[3:38:58.040 --> 3:39:02.440]  I mean, the few that survive step number one get eliminated at step number two.
[3:39:02.440 --> 3:39:09.560]  Now if they, if they survive step number two, then the next, uh, the next level of opposition
[3:39:09.560 --> 3:39:13.480]  is to try and buy them off, either directly or indirectly.
[3:39:13.480 --> 3:39:18.040]  They provide funding or they, they provide investments in their corporations and they
[3:39:18.040 --> 3:39:22.880]  load their board of directors and over a period of time, all of a sudden their organizations
[3:39:22.880 --> 3:39:25.360]  are, uh, are bought off.
[3:39:25.360 --> 3:39:26.960]  And sometimes they're even offered money.
[3:39:26.960 --> 3:39:31.720]  They want you to just go retire, you're old enough now, you, you've done your share,
[3:39:31.720 --> 3:39:36.320]  you can go live in the Bahamas and we have this estate for you and a chauffeur and a limousine
[3:39:36.320 --> 3:39:37.920]  and so forth.
[3:39:37.920 --> 3:39:40.240]  And why don't you just go away?
[3:39:40.240 --> 3:39:45.240]  And if that doesn't work, but then finally they, they turn to more physical things where
[3:39:45.240 --> 3:39:49.280]  sometimes people are suicided or that kind of thing.
[3:39:49.280 --> 3:39:52.420]  But I know what they do with it is pretty predictable.
[3:39:52.420 --> 3:39:59.280]  So the fact that you and I are still surviving means that, uh, I guess, uh, we haven't been
[3:39:59.280 --> 3:40:00.480]  discredited yet.
[3:40:00.480 --> 3:40:02.120]  Well, here's what's happening.
[3:40:02.120 --> 3:40:07.640]  Uh, I had a nightline call me and I know that's an operation and that that shows to come
[3:40:07.640 --> 3:40:09.840]  out is CIA Pentagon run.
[3:40:09.840 --> 3:40:14.600]  And I'm just basically told them, no, I said, I have no, I mean, first they wanted to talk
[3:40:14.600 --> 3:40:17.280]  to we are, they want to talk to me at first and I said, do we are changed?
[3:40:17.280 --> 3:40:18.680]  You want to talk to them?
[3:40:18.680 --> 3:40:22.960]  And most people kill to be on nightline, not me folks, uh, the, the old adage, any publicity
[3:40:22.960 --> 3:40:25.280]  is good publicity isn't actually not true.
[3:40:25.280 --> 3:40:30.480]  And I just said, you know what, because I've, you know, discovery channel comes in, uh,
[3:40:30.480 --> 3:40:35.560]  history channel comes in, BBC comes in and they'll tell you, Oh, I, I'm a fan.
[3:40:35.560 --> 3:40:36.560]  And I go, come on.
[3:40:36.560 --> 3:40:37.560]  I know you're lying.
[3:40:37.560 --> 3:40:41.600]  I know it's a hit piece and then it's a total dishonest hit piece.
[3:40:41.600 --> 3:40:48.600]  Uh, and, uh, you know, now at this point they are so discredited.
[3:40:48.600 --> 3:40:49.880]  Now if it's live, I'll do it.
[3:40:49.880 --> 3:40:54.840]  I've always said I won't turn down anything that's live, uh, but, uh, and, and so, you
[3:40:54.840 --> 3:40:58.520]  know, I do get those opportunities few and far between and I don't turn them down because
[3:40:58.520 --> 3:41:01.640]  there I can actually, you know, try to get something out, right?
[3:41:01.640 --> 3:41:05.080]  But you know, to have the head of the Kissinger group, which as you know, is one of the most
[3:41:05.080 --> 3:41:09.320]  powerful groups out there, very, and that's a Rothschild slash Rockefeller management
[3:41:09.320 --> 3:41:14.160]  group, uh, you know, uh, saying, yeah, I'm coming on, I'm coming on to counter you guys.
[3:41:14.160 --> 3:41:18.080]  And I said on there, I said, you guys must really be in trouble if you're having to go
[3:41:18.080 --> 3:41:19.600]  ahead and come on shows now.
[3:41:19.600 --> 3:41:23.720]  And he basically was, you know, just said, yeah, and, and I've had other people have
[3:41:23.720 --> 3:41:27.240]  gone out and confronted globalist at events and said, you know, the new old orders falling
[3:41:27.240 --> 3:41:30.640]  apart and they say, well, it's in trouble, but we're going to keep it going.
[3:41:30.640 --> 3:41:31.640]  I mean, this is their life.
[3:41:31.640 --> 3:41:33.080]  Do you want to comment on that?
[3:41:33.080 --> 3:41:34.080]  Well, yeah.
[3:41:34.080 --> 3:41:39.440]  I think it is their life and that they, they know, um, how to, uh, manipulate opinion and
[3:41:39.440 --> 3:41:40.440]  public opinion.
[3:41:40.440 --> 3:41:44.900]  So these guys must have thought that by coming on to your show that they were clever enough
[3:41:44.900 --> 3:41:51.960]  and skilled enough to, uh, uh, to create, to move public opinion against you, I guess,
[3:41:51.960 --> 3:41:56.040]  or to capture your audience in some way, or at least to paint the picture that they were
[3:41:56.040 --> 3:41:59.720]  really nice guys after all they, they must have had some vision of how well they were
[3:41:59.720 --> 3:42:01.320]  trying to humanize themselves.
[3:42:01.320 --> 3:42:06.600]  He, he, he made, we counted it 10 times in 30 minute interview, which is like, it's about
[3:42:06.600 --> 3:42:09.280]  25 minutes of airtime.
[3:42:09.280 --> 3:42:14.960]  He, he, he said 10 times, well, we've got evil, uh, robber barons and we've got to
[3:42:14.960 --> 3:42:17.720]  have a world government to contain and control them.
[3:42:17.720 --> 3:42:19.400]  Well that we've already got a world government.
[3:42:19.400 --> 3:42:21.160]  These guys already do what they want.
[3:42:21.160 --> 3:42:23.400]  We've got to have this global government to control them.
[3:42:23.400 --> 3:42:26.780]  And I said on air, I said, I said, you've said that a bunch of times and he got mad
[3:42:26.780 --> 3:42:27.780]  at that.
[3:42:27.780 --> 3:42:30.120]  I said, you're just putting the talking point out and he said, well, I'm allowed to have
[3:42:30.120 --> 3:42:31.120]  my view.
[3:42:31.120 --> 3:42:33.680]  And I said, you are the guys that want the world government.
[3:42:33.680 --> 3:42:35.600]  It's like, please don't throw me in the briar patch.
[3:42:35.600 --> 3:42:39.200]  So I talked to him at the end of the interview and he was, he was upset.
[3:42:39.200 --> 3:42:42.640]  Uh, and I didn't taunt him cause I know they're very dangerous.
[3:42:42.640 --> 3:42:44.040]  I just said, look, thank you for coming on.
[3:42:44.040 --> 3:42:47.160]  I really hope you'll change your mind about trying to enslave us.
[3:42:47.160 --> 3:42:51.360]  And he, he just said goodbye, but he was not friendly at, in fact, John, did you hear that
[3:42:51.360 --> 3:42:54.400]  how he was not happy at the end?
[3:42:54.400 --> 3:42:58.120]  Well, I guess he just didn't, he didn't achieve his goal.
[3:42:58.120 --> 3:43:03.680]  So, but you know, you're thinking back to Naomi, uh, and you asked whether or not she
[3:43:03.680 --> 3:43:06.440]  really, uh, might be sincere or not.
[3:43:06.440 --> 3:43:12.320]  I have no doubt that she is totally sincere in her opposition to Marshall law and in her
[3:43:12.320 --> 3:43:15.160]  opposition to the neocon agenda.
[3:43:15.160 --> 3:43:21.560]  But my question is why does she not mention anything, uh, about the left wing agenda that
[3:43:21.560 --> 3:43:24.480]  is advocated by it's identical.
[3:43:24.480 --> 3:43:26.360]  It's just got, it's just, it's got a different out.
[3:43:26.360 --> 3:43:31.520]  It's like a velvet iron fist, you know, a red glove or a black glove over.
[3:43:31.520 --> 3:43:32.520]  It's identical.
[3:43:32.520 --> 3:43:39.600]  And, and she plays the game of trying to make it seem like it's all a right wing conspiracy
[3:43:39.600 --> 3:43:43.960]  and totally ignores the left wing and you and I both know the left wing and the right
[3:43:43.960 --> 3:43:48.960]  wing are just two different wings of the same ugly bird called collectivism.
[3:43:48.960 --> 3:43:54.120]  So when I see a Rhodes scholar that's playing the game of focusing totally on one side of
[3:43:54.120 --> 3:43:59.080]  this, uh, this little scam and not the other, I know what she's doing.
[3:43:59.080 --> 3:44:03.040]  She's trying to generate support for the Democrats.
[3:44:03.040 --> 3:44:04.720]  That's what her mission is as far as I know.
[3:44:04.720 --> 3:44:05.720]  And so it's like judo.
[3:44:05.720 --> 3:44:08.360]  They're using, uh, it's a classic left right paradigm.
[3:44:08.360 --> 3:44:13.400]  They're using an attack on the right wing of their sector, like a solar panel to actually
[3:44:13.400 --> 3:44:15.840]  energize the other side of the wing.
[3:44:15.840 --> 3:44:16.840]  Exactly.
[3:44:16.840 --> 3:44:17.840]  Exactly.
[3:44:17.840 --> 3:44:23.520]  So, and I don't think somebody as smart as, as a Rhodes scholar would, uh, would accidentally
[3:44:23.520 --> 3:44:24.520]  do that.
[3:44:24.520 --> 3:44:25.880]  I mean, she has to know what she's doing.
[3:44:25.880 --> 3:44:30.360]  Well, I've talked to her privately and it is, she's really friendly, like a great sales
[3:44:30.360 --> 3:44:31.360]  woman.
[3:44:31.360 --> 3:44:32.360]  Oh, yeah.
[3:44:32.360 --> 3:44:33.360]  She has a great job.
[3:44:33.360 --> 3:44:34.680]  She's like, oh, please send me all that info.
[3:44:34.680 --> 3:44:40.720]  Alex, thank you so much, but I can tell it is a mask and, uh, I'm going to get her back
[3:44:40.720 --> 3:44:41.720]  on.
[3:44:41.720 --> 3:44:43.160]  Maybe I should get her back on and have you on weather.
[3:44:43.160 --> 3:44:45.280]  Well, I would love to talk to her.
[3:44:45.280 --> 3:44:46.880]  I would love to sit down and meet her.
[3:44:46.880 --> 3:44:47.880]  Meet her.
[3:44:47.880 --> 3:44:50.280]  You know, there's always the chance that we're wrong or that I'm wrong.
[3:44:50.280 --> 3:44:54.000]  Well, there's always the chance that, that they see what's happening and they want to
[3:44:54.000 --> 3:44:56.360]  turn back, but you're right.
[3:44:56.360 --> 3:44:59.120]  She would then be attacking the whole left side of the paradigm.
[3:44:59.120 --> 3:45:00.120]  Yes.
[3:45:00.120 --> 3:45:01.840]  He should be because there's no difference.
[3:45:01.840 --> 3:45:05.640]  But the good news is everywhere she goes now, as I've seen the YouTubes, that's being brought
[3:45:05.640 --> 3:45:06.640]  up to her.
[3:45:06.640 --> 3:45:07.640]  Oh, it is.
[3:45:07.640 --> 3:45:08.640]  By leftist.
[3:45:08.640 --> 3:45:09.640]  They're going, they're going.
[3:45:09.640 --> 3:45:14.040]  I mean, are you not seeing what I'm, I mean, I just want your opinion because I don't know.
[3:45:14.040 --> 3:45:18.240]  I'm finally seeing the left like never before break their chains and become Liberty lovers
[3:45:18.240 --> 3:45:22.200]  and get past these levels, they're buying guns, they're, they understand the government's
[3:45:22.200 --> 3:45:23.200]  bad.
[3:45:23.200 --> 3:45:26.920]  They understand any government funding that's given is going to go to corporations.
[3:45:26.920 --> 3:45:30.120]  They finally, you know, they finally, I think are getting it.
[3:45:30.120 --> 3:45:32.360]  Well, you mean at the grassroots level?
[3:45:32.360 --> 3:45:33.360]  Yes.
[3:45:33.360 --> 3:45:34.360]  Yes.
[3:45:34.360 --> 3:45:37.520]  So no doubt at the grassroots, but up there, if they, at the higher elevations where you
[3:45:37.520 --> 3:45:42.480]  need oxygen to breathe, those guys exactly what's going on.
[3:45:42.480 --> 3:45:45.000]  God, how did they do that?
[3:45:45.000 --> 3:45:51.280]  Because, you know, you talk about how first they ignore you, then they attack you or first
[3:45:51.280 --> 3:45:53.400]  ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they attack you, then you win.
[3:45:53.400 --> 3:45:57.000]  As Gandhi said, I kind of had it in reverse.
[3:45:57.000 --> 3:46:06.120]  These had hunters in, in 1998, even 97, I had like people call me who were big shot Democrats
[3:46:06.120 --> 3:46:07.760]  when I was attacking Bill Clinton.
[3:46:07.760 --> 3:46:10.680]  And then I'd find out who they were and, you know, I, they would say, well, meet with
[3:46:10.680 --> 3:46:13.760]  me, but you've got a problem to say we met and so I can't say their names.
[3:46:13.760 --> 3:46:17.200]  And I always, you know, follow my word unless it's something criminal.
[3:46:17.200 --> 3:46:21.760]  And then you meet with this famous Democrat or you meet with another person and, you know,
[3:46:21.760 --> 3:46:23.720]  this is happening maybe five, six times.
[3:46:23.720 --> 3:46:28.880]  And then later it was corporate offers of millions of dollars to, you know, be basically
[3:46:28.880 --> 3:46:32.480]  a right winger and put out kind of a new hardcore brand of Rush Limbaugh.
[3:46:32.480 --> 3:46:38.480]  I mean, I turned down, you know, 600 stations, basically, I was going to be tested out and
[3:46:38.480 --> 3:46:42.240]  I guess most people, you just give them the offer that they just want that money.
[3:46:42.240 --> 3:46:43.600]  But money doesn't matter to me.
[3:46:43.600 --> 3:46:48.880]  It's ideas that I traffic in, it's, it's, it's, it's history, it's humanity.
[3:46:48.880 --> 3:46:51.040]  It's the species, it's my children.
[3:46:51.040 --> 3:46:52.400]  I serve ideals.
[3:46:52.400 --> 3:46:58.320]  I guess they see me as a foolish romantic, but everything we've got was built on romanticism.
[3:46:58.320 --> 3:47:00.760]  God bless you, Alex.
[3:47:00.760 --> 3:47:05.080]  That's exactly the spirit of America that we need to revive.
[3:47:05.080 --> 3:47:11.120]  Well, I just can't, I mean, they, they generate fiat money out of nothing and then they buy
[3:47:11.120 --> 3:47:12.120]  the world with it.
[3:47:12.120 --> 3:47:13.920]  It's such a scam.
[3:47:13.920 --> 3:47:17.880]  Well, it is a scam, but it works and it's a very frustrating to all of us.
[3:47:17.880 --> 3:47:22.000]  In fact, every once in a while, I still go through that dark night where you wonder,
[3:47:22.000 --> 3:47:23.920]  is this really worth it?
[3:47:23.920 --> 3:47:27.760]  Is humanity capable of salvaging itself?
[3:47:27.760 --> 3:47:31.160]  And of course, when the sun rises in the morning, you always say, yes, you bet, and I'm going
[3:47:31.160 --> 3:47:33.800]  to be part of it and you charge back into it.
[3:47:33.800 --> 3:47:38.160]  But boy, it gets off with discouraging at times because people, you know, you look around
[3:47:38.160 --> 3:47:43.640]  and even in your closest circle of friends and even in some in your family, you think,
[3:47:43.640 --> 3:47:45.320]  well, these are excellent people.
[3:47:45.320 --> 3:47:51.880]  And yet you see them kind of sell out when, when it comes time to get a job, for example.
[3:47:51.880 --> 3:47:58.920]  I've seen people work for, for, well, let's just be specific for the pharmaceutical industry.
[3:47:58.920 --> 3:47:59.920]  Beautiful people, I know.
[3:47:59.920 --> 3:48:03.720]  And yet they're out there selling these drugs and, you know, deep down underneath, they
[3:48:03.720 --> 3:48:05.840]  know that they're hurting people.
[3:48:05.840 --> 3:48:11.520]  But boy, does that pay good and does that card that the company provides, is it nice?
[3:48:11.520 --> 3:48:17.400]  And boy, these trips they take to the South Pacific Islands, all paid for by the company.
[3:48:17.400 --> 3:48:18.680]  Can you turn that down?
[3:48:18.680 --> 3:48:19.680]  But it's all hollow.
[3:48:19.680 --> 3:48:21.840]  I mean, I want to feel good about myself.
[3:48:21.840 --> 3:48:25.280]  I want to know that I'm helping humanity.
[3:48:25.280 --> 3:48:29.760]  And, you know, these yuppies think they can just basically poop everywhere.
[3:48:29.760 --> 3:48:33.880]  I hate to use that analogy, but that's what it is, and then it won't soil their own nest.
[3:48:33.880 --> 3:48:35.800]  And nobody cares about anybody.
[3:48:35.800 --> 3:48:36.800]  Everything falls apart.
[3:48:36.800 --> 3:48:37.800]  Yeah.
[3:48:37.800 --> 3:48:38.800]  That's right.
[3:48:38.800 --> 3:48:44.620]  Well, as I said before, fortunately, we don't need 51% of the population to have their head
[3:48:44.620 --> 3:48:46.000]  screwed on, right?
[3:48:46.000 --> 3:48:52.320]  If we can just get 3% or even 2% who understand and who are willing to dedicate a significant
[3:48:52.320 --> 3:48:56.600]  portion of their lives to this thing, we can recapture the program.
[3:48:56.600 --> 3:48:57.600]  Let's turn it around.
[3:48:57.600 --> 3:48:58.600]  I agree.
[3:48:58.600 --> 3:49:00.680]  Let's jam a call and we'll come back and take a bunch of them.
[3:49:00.680 --> 3:49:02.920]  Richard, Richard, where are you calling us from today?
[3:49:02.920 --> 3:49:04.400]  Omaha, Nebraska.
[3:49:04.400 --> 3:49:05.400]  Welcome, sir.
[3:49:05.400 --> 3:49:06.400]  Yeah.
[3:49:06.400 --> 3:49:14.160]  Last night on the Educational Network, a point of view, they had a special about privatization
[3:49:14.160 --> 3:49:22.680]  of prisons, and all where they went into detail, which are called corporations, are actually,
[3:49:22.680 --> 3:49:28.280]  if not taking over some prisons, are actually building their own prisons, and then going
[3:49:28.280 --> 3:49:35.280]  to state legislatures to actually, what you call, toughen up on laws just so people can
[3:49:35.280 --> 3:49:42.040]  get arrested and imprisoned, and then they hire their own guards and everything.
[3:49:42.040 --> 3:49:48.080]  Sir, sir, sir, a battery in your backyard speeding will now be six months a year in prison.
[3:49:48.080 --> 3:49:49.080]  Yeah.
[3:49:49.080 --> 3:49:53.000]  I mean, G. Ebel Griffin, you want to comment on that and we'll hold you over into the break.
[3:49:53.000 --> 3:49:54.000]  Well, sure.
[3:49:54.000 --> 3:49:57.880]  That's the trend, of course, is to get all of these legitimate functions of government,
[3:49:57.880 --> 3:50:01.720]  certainly prisons would be a legitimate function of government, to get it out of the political
[3:50:01.720 --> 3:50:06.400]  sphere so that the voters couldn't ever have any chance at reforming it, you know.
[3:50:06.400 --> 3:50:08.360]  And let's be clear, this isn't free market.
[3:50:08.360 --> 3:50:12.800]  We pay the tax money to a private group that just so happens to be generally be owned by
[3:50:12.800 --> 3:50:18.600]  a money laundering drug cartel, and I'm surprised, was James Dobson saying this was bad that
[3:50:18.600 --> 3:50:23.000]  the prisons go and then lobby for tougher laws to put more of us in their prisons?
[3:50:23.000 --> 3:50:25.200]  Well, I didn't catch that, Alex.
[3:50:25.200 --> 3:50:27.360]  No, I mean, the listener, Richard.
[3:50:27.360 --> 3:50:28.360]  Oh.
[3:50:28.360 --> 3:50:29.360]  Okay.
[3:50:29.360 --> 3:50:30.360]  Richard, are you still there?
[3:50:30.360 --> 3:50:32.640]  I haven't kept up on him lately.
[3:50:32.640 --> 3:50:35.520]  Well, I mean, that's focus on the family you were talking about.
[3:50:35.520 --> 3:50:37.560]  I tell you what, stay there, Richard.
[3:50:37.560 --> 3:50:40.840]  I want to continue for infowars.com, stream listeners.
[3:50:40.840 --> 3:50:43.920]  We're going to talk during this break so we don't waste time with Richard and G. Ebel
[3:50:43.920 --> 3:50:44.920]  Griffin.
[3:50:44.920 --> 3:50:46.720]  We'll come back on the other side with everybody else's calls.
[3:50:46.720 --> 3:50:52.920]  It is a big idea, a new world order in the near future.
[3:50:52.920 --> 3:51:01.560]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[3:51:01.560 --> 3:51:04.720]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[3:51:04.720 --> 3:51:09.680]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating
[3:51:09.680 --> 3:51:15.080]  80% of humanity is at hand.
[3:51:15.080 --> 3:51:20.000]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[3:51:20.000 --> 3:51:24.320]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[3:51:24.320 --> 3:51:27.040]  The old verges make great progress for the world government.
[3:51:27.040 --> 3:51:28.040]  Most people have no idea.
[3:51:28.040 --> 3:51:29.040]  They're not after money.
[3:51:29.040 --> 3:51:30.040]  They have all the money they need.
[3:51:30.040 --> 3:51:31.040]  They're after power.
[3:51:31.040 --> 3:51:32.040]  Yes, they're after easier.

[3:52:44.560 --> 3:52:45.680]  power hour.
[3:52:45.680 --> 3:52:48.880]  Are you concerned about the high cost of prescription drugs?

[3:54:12.040 --> 3:54:16.640]  Scott, but Abraham, Robert, I want to give you guys a local number, we'll go to you first
[3:54:16.640 --> 3:54:23.440]  512-646-5400, we'll be turning that system on in about five minutes.
[3:54:23.440 --> 3:54:30.880]  That's, of course, 512-646-5400, in fact, you're welcome to call in on that right now.
[3:54:30.880 --> 3:54:35.480]  But you were making a point in the behind-the-scenes interview we were just doing with the InfoWare
[3:54:35.480 --> 3:54:39.960]  streams that everybody needs to tune to now, because it won't be on the AM or FM or shortwave,
[3:54:39.960 --> 3:54:44.800]  we'll just, or the satellite will just be at infowars.com with the audio and prisonplanet.tv
[3:54:44.800 --> 3:54:45.800]  with the video.
[3:54:45.800 --> 3:54:49.160]  Would you ever grab them for another 20 minutes or so, we really appreciate him doing that.
[3:54:49.160 --> 3:54:53.440]  You were making the point about how, yeah, the private prisons are lobbying, that was
[3:54:53.440 --> 3:54:57.520]  just in the news the other day, I'm surprised it's on TV now, that they come in lobby and
[3:54:57.520 --> 3:55:01.680]  say we need more people in prison because we've got private prisons we've opened, we
[3:55:01.680 --> 3:55:03.240]  need to fill them.
[3:55:03.240 --> 3:55:07.520]  And so now we see people being arrested for no turn signal, no seatbelt, kids being
[3:55:07.520 --> 3:55:13.000]  GPSed for the smallest of things, I mean, there's millions of new police and bureaucrats
[3:55:13.000 --> 3:55:15.680]  and they're going to find terrorists.
[3:55:15.680 --> 3:55:19.520]  And you talked about O'Brien torturing Winston saying, hey, this isn't for criminals, can
[3:55:19.520 --> 3:55:20.680]  you recap that?
[3:55:20.680 --> 3:55:28.240]  Yeah, in 1984, that book 1984 by George Orwell, that point was made so well, O'Brien is the
[3:55:28.240 --> 3:55:34.120]  master criminal, he's working for the government, and he's torturing Winston, who is the good
[3:55:34.120 --> 3:55:36.800]  guy and he's explaining the way the life really is.
[3:55:36.800 --> 3:55:41.000]  He says, Winston, come on, wake up, be real, this is the real world you're living in.
[3:55:41.000 --> 3:55:46.840]  And he says, you don't think we have laws in order to keep law in order or to enforce
[3:55:46.840 --> 3:55:48.080]  justice to you?
[3:55:48.080 --> 3:55:53.480]  No, no, no, he says, Winston, come on, wake up, we have so many laws so that we have so
[3:55:53.480 --> 3:55:57.200]  many of them that it's impossible not to break laws, no matter what you do.
[3:55:57.200 --> 3:56:01.760]  If you get up in the morning, you probably have broken the five laws before you brush
[3:56:01.760 --> 3:56:02.760]  your teeth.
[3:56:02.760 --> 3:56:09.000]  The purpose of having so many laws is so that everybody becomes a criminal, and now we have
[3:56:09.000 --> 3:56:16.800]  a reason for arresting anyone, and we can control people because they're all criminals.
[3:56:16.800 --> 3:56:20.360]  And I think that's the idea that we're seeing an unfold right now.
[3:56:20.360 --> 3:56:25.240]  In our lives today, I saw something on the internet last night, some poor bloke in the
[3:56:25.240 --> 3:56:32.400]  UK got arrested, and he spent 18 hours in prison for dropping an apple core on the
[3:56:32.400 --> 3:56:33.400]  ground.
[3:56:33.400 --> 3:56:35.720]  That's what it's all about.
[3:56:35.720 --> 3:56:40.920]  It's all about getting total control, getting you in the system, and I think even a lot
[3:56:40.920 --> 3:56:43.240]  of police now realize and know this.
[3:56:43.240 --> 3:56:47.560]  I mean, every roid head I've seen at the gym, now I see his officers strutting down the
[3:56:47.560 --> 3:56:53.640]  street with, you know, the devil skulls tattooed all over him, just smiling with satanic pleasure
[3:56:53.640 --> 3:56:59.560]  that this is their time, I guess, and every town's going to have ne'er-do-well goons and
[3:56:59.560 --> 3:57:01.560]  black uniforms.
[3:57:01.560 --> 3:57:04.400]  In fact, next hour, I want to tell you the story briefly, and then we'll go back to
[3:57:04.400 --> 3:57:06.320]  the calls.
[3:57:06.320 --> 3:57:12.240]  So for all the callers, Ray and Scott and everybody else, just Abraham, Robert, call
[3:57:12.240 --> 3:57:18.480]  in right now at 512-646-5400, and you'll go to the head of the line for those callers
[3:57:18.480 --> 3:57:22.520]  that were holding on Genesis lines, and I want to thank the network for the great job
[3:57:22.520 --> 3:57:25.160]  and all the affiliates and everything they do.
[3:57:25.160 --> 3:57:28.840]  But I have the footage of FEMA and road to tyranny saying the Founding Fathers are terrorist.
[3:57:28.840 --> 3:57:33.680]  I have the FBI training manuals with their phone numbers on it saying the Constitution's
[3:57:33.680 --> 3:57:36.080]  bad, people that talk about it are terrorist.
[3:57:36.080 --> 3:57:39.840]  And I have police squad car video where they arrest people who are having pocket constitutions
[3:57:39.840 --> 3:57:43.440]  and state police stand there going, I think this is illegal.
[3:57:43.440 --> 3:57:47.800]  But at a Christian school in Texas, major university, they said you're not allowed to
[3:57:47.800 --> 3:57:51.800]  say the Bill of Rights and Constitution's good, it's now a terrorist document.
[3:57:51.800 --> 3:57:57.440]  I mean, it's so over the top, and I interviewed those guys, that rebroadcast is coming up
[3:57:57.440 --> 3:58:01.780]  in 20 minutes, but we're going to end the main network transmission now, we'll be back
[3:58:01.780 --> 3:58:06.680]  tomorrow at 11 a.m., 3 p.m., but if you want to hear these other calls and more from G.
[3:58:06.680 --> 3:58:10.200]  Edward Griffin, you'll want to go like tens of thousands of people are doing right now
[3:58:10.200 --> 3:58:16.720]  and listen at infowars.com on those streams, and those streams alone, or you can watch
[3:58:16.720 --> 3:58:23.280]  us at prisonplanet.tv, we'll be right back on the other side in Overdrive with G. Edward
[3:58:23.280 --> 3:58:36.240]  Griffin at infowars.com.
[3:58:36.240 --> 3:58:40.320]  Our beloved republic is on her knees, the forces of globalism are destroying national
[3:58:40.320 --> 3:58:44.280]  sovereignty worldwide, but in liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[3:58:44.280 --> 3:58:47.920]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up, it is essential
[3:58:47.920 --> 3:58:52.040]  that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the new world order
[3:58:52.040 --> 3:58:53.040]  master plan.
[3:58:53.040 --> 3:58:57.320]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[3:58:57.320 --> 3:59:02.680]  In the info war, prisonplanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
